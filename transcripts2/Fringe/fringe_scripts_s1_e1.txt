 (WOMAN SPEAKING IN GERMAN ON INTERCOM) The captain has turned on the "fasten seat belt" sign. Please make sure your seat belts are securely fastened. (PASSENGERS SPEAKING IN GERMAN) I don't speak German. I'm from Denver. (SPEAKS IN GERMAN) I'm from Den... (CAPTAIN SPEAKING IN GERMAN ON INTERCOM) MAN: My friend, it is an electrical storm. - I understand. Heh. - Here. Gum? - No. Uh, thank you. (WOMAN SPEAKING IN GERMAN)

We can't keep doing this, sneaking around. The department's not a massive fan of office romance. That policy seminar was endless, wasn't it? I kept staring at you. I actually had to move my chair to stop. - Well, I... I think Charlie knows. - He doesn't know. - Well, I think he does. - If he knew, you would be transferred.

 Somebody making the call whether you and I get to live in the same city... ...that's unacceptable. Anyway, that's all just preamble to the kicker, which is that... ...I love you. (PHONE BUZZING) Olivia Dunham. (CLEARS THROAT) Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Yes, sir. I'm on my way. Incident at Logan, international flight, Charlie's on his way. (PHONE RINGS) Agent Scott. Olivia Dunham, FBI. We got a flight out of Hamburg. Hundred and forty-seven passengers. Towers lost contact three hours in. Thought it might've been electrical interference. They entered our airspace radio-silent. Navy then scrambles two F-18's for escort. They reported stains in the windows, no signs of life aboard the jet. White House approved a CDC request... ...for the jet not to be opened until they arrive. No signs of life? Who was flying the plane? Logan's one of the first airports with the PEARL autopilot system. Plane landed itself right on time, unlike every flight I've ever taken. Let me assure you, we'd be happy to treat you as family too. Good old NTSB. They all like to think they're cops. - Agent Scott. - Agent Francis. Agent Dunham. Whatever the hell McNeary saw through that window... ...it made him throw up in front of his whole unit. MAN: Excuse me. So, what's going on here? Some sort of accident? GUARD: Tarmac's closed. Nothing you have to worry about, sir. - All right. GUARD: Move it along. I'll do that. Thanks. Although this is a joint task force... ...you are all now reporting to the Department of Homeland Security. I'm Special Agent in Charge Broyles. DC has sent me here to make sure we get results. Standard level-four HAZ MAT suits are required to go in. Members from each agency on the starting line as follows: CIA, Baronoff. FBI, Charlie Francis and John Scott. Everyone else stand by. Okay, people, let's move. OLIVIA: Sir, Olivia Dunham, FBI inter-agency liaison. BROYLES: Liaison on an inter-agency task force. Gotta love that. Kind of like powdered sugar on a glazed donut. Excuse me, if I'm gonna do my job effectively... ...I like my information first-hand. That's not redundancy, that's accountability. I know exactly who you are. You want in, liaison? Suit up. AGENT: What kind of terrorism is this? - Who says it's terrorism? REPORTER (ON TV): Sources tell us the plane was deliberately set ablaze... ...by the CDC after all passengers, remains had been removed... ...leading to speculation of hazardous... AGENT 1: Seat 21-A: John Rosen bloom. AGENT 2: 43-B: Ellie Sampson. AGENT 1: Car salesman. Criminal history's negative. AGENT 2: Intelligence checks negative. Have we reviewed video from Hamburg? We need to see if any passengers were showing signs of illness. We need names. On its way, Dawson. What the hell's taking so long with the black box? - Police tell me that terminal shut down. - Been down since 0400. - You got any more questions? - Who's point from CDC on the bone...? Agent Paley, you want his home number? No, but I'd like the whole report, and not just this... We're on that too, liaison. We don't think what happened was a result of the in-flight movie. Back Bay PD got a call at 0300 from a guard on duty at a storage facility. He saw two, and I quote, " suspicious Middle Eastern men"... - ...handing a white guy a briefcase. - Liaison. Take it. Go find out. Take what, that? You're telling me that's my assignment? Yeah, honey, would you mind? REPORTER: The decision was made to burn the plane only after it was determined... OLIVIA: Petty bastard. He's pissed his best friend sexually assaulted three Marine privates. - I'm the bad guy, I put him away. - Broyles is an idiot. You're smarter, you're stronger, you're much better looking. He's jealous. What? You said you loved me. In the motel. Yeah. That was a big deal. Yeah, well, you didn't say anything back so I just let it go. I've been sort of bad at this for a long time. Until you. I wanted to say I love you too. Let's go check the trash together. - Empty. - Acetylene? Propane? No. Ammonia. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? I'm a federal agent. (ANIMAL GIBBERING) We need to get a chem transport team out here now. I'm on it. (PHONE BEEPING) No signal. Freeze. FBI. JOHN: I have a gun. I will shoot. - John? JOHN (OVER PHONE): We got a runner. - Keep him alive. - I'm on my way. (PHONE DIALING) JOHN: Hands in the air. - John! (SC REAMS) DOCTOR: you were very lucky today, Agent Dunham. your wounds could have easily been much more severe. Agent Scott wasn't as fortunate. While he survived the initial blast... ...Agent Scott was exposed to some synthetic chemical compounds. Work that was done in the labs you found. He's not contagious, but until we understand more... ...it's better not to introduce any additional contaminants. We haven't been able to identify the substance that's affecting him. The CDC has sent in specialists... ...but, well, they've never seen anything like what's happening here. We've put Agent Scott in a drug-induced coma. His temperature has been lowered significantly... ...to try and slow the progress. I'm sorry, Agent Dunham. It's me. Liaison. I found a connection between the Hamburg flight... ...and what's happened to Agent Scott. His name's Walter Bishop. He's a scientific researcher from Cambridge, born in '46. Harvard-educated, post-grad at Oxford and MIT. Look at the experiments in the '70s. Dr. Bishop might have information that might tell us... ...what happened aboard that plane and save Scott's life. Says the guy's been at St. Claire's for 17 years. I saw that. An assistant was killed in his lab. Rumors about Dr. Bishop using humans as guinea pigs. He was charged with manslaughter, but deemed mentally unfit. - Why're you so sure he's worth our time? - Why are you so sure he's not? Listen, you and I got off on the wrong foot. If my past job performance as U.S. Marine Special Investigator offends you... Well, yeah, it does. A man who serves his country 30 years... ...has a few drinks, a lapse in judgment... A lapse in judgment that will haunt three women for the rest of their lives. But that's not tonight's business, is it? Look, D.C. has tasked me to make sure... ...that our reaction to Flight 627 is beyond reproach. Now, it says here... ...in 1991 the glorious state of Massachusetts forbade Dr. Bishop... ...from having any visitors, with the exception of immediate family. From where I sit, barging into a mental institution waving the Patriot Act... Which is what you'd need. ...And demanding face time with some old lab rat... ...who you think might be behind the most terrifying terror I can imagine... I'm coming to you with a lead, and your personal resentment... You're wasting your breath and my time. Do you understand "immediate family"? You wanna question Dr. Bishop, go find his next of kin, have them escort you. Talk to Bishop, uncover something substantial, and I will have your back. Until then, I am not so convinced. Now, can you handle that? He does have a son. Is the son local too? Not exactly. MAN: So this guy's Walter Bishop's son. OLIVIA: His name's Peter Bishop. He's a high school dropout. IQ at 190, which is 50 points north of genius. Misfit. Nomad. Hasn't kept a job longer than two months. He's been a wildland fireman, cargo pilot... ...and, briefly, a college chemistry professor. He falsified a degree from MIT... ...and even managed to get a few papers published before he was found out. Sounds like a massive pain in the ass. PETER: My resume is hardly traditional. Around these parts, traditional increasingly means irrelevant. Hundred billion sunk into infrastructure, you can barely keep lights on. You need someone to oversee construction on 600 miles of pipeline... ...to carry crude between your fields and the port. A job well outside the Green Zone, I might add, while I'm still alive to do so. Someone who has a handle on the laws of hydrodynamic resistance. The heat exchange in oil-mixture flows. Someone who can work with mixed integers. You're gonna have to resize as you work across uneven terrain. That is if you wanna keep down construction costs. (MEN SPEAKING IN FARSI) I also speak Farsi. And 600,000 all-in sounds fair. Peter Bishop? Olivia Dunham, I'm with the FBI. - Okay. - You've heard of Flight 627? - The Hamburg flight. - You may be able to help us with that. Ha, ha. No, I think you got the wrong guy. Your father is Walter Bishop. Last time somebody asked me that it was an accusation. We're looking to speak with him. Due to his current status, only you can provide us access. And what possible help could that man be? And what is it exactly you're expecting me to do? Hop on a plane with you to Massachusetts? I just got here, honey. I can have you on a return flight here in four days... Let me save you the time. I'd rather stay here in Iraq. That's how much I wanna see my father. I'm going to beg you as one human being to another. Your father may be able to save someone who's dying. Someone I care about very much. Sweetheart, we all care about someone who's dying. I can't help you. I'm sorry. I know why you're here. I have your file. (CHUCKLES) What file? The one the FBI would say doesn't exist. And it has everything. Where you've been. What you're running from. And what you need while you're here. So either you come with me... ...or I let certain people know your whereabouts. When do we leave? OLIVIA: Did the doctors say anything else? Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. (OLIVIA CLEARS THROAT) Let me ask you something. My father. Not my favorite. He is without a doubt the most self-absorbed... ...twisted, abusive, brilliant, myopic son-of-a-bitch on the planet. So he was a chemist, that much I already know. He worked out of a basement lab in Harvard... ...doing research for a toothpaste company. I know there was an accident at the lab one night. My father was arrested. Beginning the first truly peaceful period in our home. But here's the thing, Olivia. My gut tells me that your friend's life, the one hanging in the balance... ...not gonna be saved by a tube of toothpaste. He worked out of Harvard. But not on toothpaste. He was part of a classified U.S. Army experimental program... ...called Kelvin Genetics. They gave him the resources to do whatever work he wanted... ...which was primarily in an area called Fringe Science. When you say Fringe Science, you mean pseudoscience. I suppose. Things like mind control, teleportation... ...astral projection, invisibility, genetic mutation, reanimation... Excuse me for a sec. Reanimation? Really? So you're telling me what? My father was Dr. Frankenstein? You know what? Why don't you go on ahead. GUARD: Dr. Bishop. Special day. You have a visitor. Hello. I knew someone would come eventually. OLIVIA: Dr. Bishop. Dr. Bishop? And you said this was... This was... When did this happen? The incident on the plane happened four days ago. - Agent Scott was injured the next day. - The dermis already indurated? - Translucent? Muscular tissue visible? - On Scott? You mean, can you see through his skin? Yes. Oh, that's not good. To see through the skin, it's, uh... It's tricky. - It's advanced like that... - What's happening to him? Can it be reversed? What is it? They... They have this horrible pudding here. Butterscotch pudding on Mondays. It's dreadful. It's Thursday. Oh? Oh, ha, ha. That's fantastic news. It can be reversed. Oh, what happened to your colleague. Years ago I worked with lab animals... ...and some of them were afflicted, but were saved. So do you remember what to do? This place, their choice of therapies has... (GRUMBLES) Dr. Bishop? You came here today with my son. I'm not allowed visitors, you see, except immediate family... ...and unless the order's been lifted... ...then it's a simple if-then formula. If you are here, then so is he. I would so much... ...so very much like to see him. So much. He asked for you. Thanks, sweetheart. I really appreciate that. Hey, I didn't tell him you were here. And call me sweetheart one more time. I'd really like that. Hello, Walter. I thought you'd be fatter. You thought I would be fatter? Excellent. First words. Perfect. No, as a boy, you were rounder. I was until the summer before high school. - Not that I'd expect you to remember. - May I see? What are you doing? Take your hands off. Pupils are good. They're good. Thank goodness. How advanced is your colleague's condition? (STAMMERS) Which is something that I... I'm unable to deduce without a firsthand examination. I must see Mr. Scott myself... ...which I am unable to do... ...while under present law... ...unless signed out by a legal guardian... ...who must be, once again, a relative. What are you asking me to...? - No. Guardian? No. Forget it. - He'll do it. - No, I will not do it. - One phone call. That's all it takes. Do you want me to make it? Because I've got my phone in my pocket. Now it's out of my pocket. You wanted my father, now you've got my father... ...which falls under the category of, " Be careful what you wish for." Sweetheart. REPORTER (ON RADIO): Every effort is being made... ...to understand what happened on Flight 627. OLIVIA: Dr. Bishop, I was curious. Did anyone else ever have access to your work? Well, uh, the assistants had bits and pieces. God, I suppose. I suppose the only one that really knew what I was doing was Belly. - Who? - Belly. William Bell. - He and I shared the lab. - William Bell? You shared your lab with the founder of Massive Dynamic? I'm sorry. I don't know what that is, Massive Dynamic. Nothing, really. Just a tiny little company. That's perfect. One becomes one of the wealthiest men on the planet. The other guy becomes an institutionalized psychopath. - Oh! - What? What happened? I just pissed myself. - Excellent. - Just a squirt. CHARLIE: I just got your message. - How is John? - Worse. CDC says the flight was caused by a synthetic compound... ...which is like saying rain is caused by a wet compound. They've run tests on John, but haven't come back with anything. - What about Bishop? - Left to right? Insane. And irritating and also my only hope. Listen. I need to question William Bell. - Could you set that up for me? - William Bell? - Massive Dynamic William Bell? - He and Bishop used to share a lab. You're kidding. Dr. Bishop? Is there ginger ale? Any ginger ale? I haven't had some in a long time. I miss it. Can we please get some ginger ale for the doctor, Agent Farnsworth? Sure. Whoa! Stop. Right now. Stop. Does this not concern you? Let him go. Petridish. Quick. Please. Good. I need to take this to my lab right away. - Your what? - Kresge Building basement, Harvard. We should leave. I have my sample. Your lab was shut down after you left. I'm sorry? Wake up. It's gone. No. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Walter, there is no lab. - It's a perfect... - No. Damn you. Damn you. We need to get him back immediately. - Liaison, when did you get back? - I need your help. I want you to know I've successfully had Dr. Walter Bishop released... ...from St. Claire's, and he requires the use of his old laboratory. - I'm sorry, what? - Kresge Building, Harvard. Basement. The university's been using it for storage for the last 17 years. It would be nice to think that your tenacity in this case... ...is a by-product of a remarkable and robust professionalism. But I can't help but wonder... ...if there wasn't something going on between you and Agent Scott. Get the lab for Bishop. So much. So much happened here. And so much is about to. OLIVIA: Dr. Bishop, I've ordered a standard forensics work package. - Is there anything else you need? - Um... Optical coherence tomograph for flesh study. Two thousand pounds of silicon. At least five anonymous blood samples from volunteer donors. A micro-organism detector, NASA-grade, of course. - There's still NASA, yes? - Yes. She's still here! Oh, this tank was the best. And... And a two-year-old Bostaurus. - A what? PETER: A cow. - He wants a cow. WALTER: Pure-bred, not cross-bred. This is important. Mature weight, 850 pounds. Internal fat average, 2.37. Is he joking? Genetically, humans and cows are separated by only a couple lines of DNA. - It's an ethical test subject. - Where'd you learn that? - MIT? - No, actually. I picked that up reading books. You should try it some time. It's fun. - Get him the cow. - Fantastic, thank you. The only thing better than a cow is a human. Unless you need milk. Then you really need a cow. (COW MOOS) Coffee? Thanks. Tell me. What else did that file say? About yours truly. How bad was it? I'm not at liberty to discuss it. (CHUCKLES) You go ahead and liberate yourself... ...because I'm here now, so I kind of feel like I deserve the truth, don't you? There was no file. - I needed you back here. - So, what? You were bluffing? - I was desperate. - I'm usually good at reading people. - That's what I do. - I could see you were in trouble. - Anyone could see that. - So I could have stayed. Ha, ha. I could've stayed in Iraq. You know, a car bomb went off this morning in Kirkuk. - You might just owe me a thank you. - Ha. Yeah, well. I owe a lot. Yeah, I figured. - Mafia? - Ha-ha-ha. A guy named Big Eddie. You owe money to a guy nicknamed Big Eddie? No, I owe money to a guy named Big Eddie. He had it legally changed. And the thing is, I'm not even a gambler. I mean, I never was, it just... - A couple years ago I went a bit crazy. - I thought you were a genius. - You must've had a system. - Of course there was a system. The house was cheating, but try telling them that. WALTER: In '72, during Vietnam... ...the DO D's biochem division had us working on a leprotic contagion... ...for possible use against the Vietcong. It's possible that whatever affected that plane... ...may have been derived from that work. What about John? What's infecting him is merely a chemical reaction... ...to the raw laboratory ingredients, not the finished contagion. - We can synthesize a counter-agent. - So you can help... Don't do that. Don't give her false hope. There's no false, it's not false. It's real. I could help, yes, if I had a precise inventory... ...of what was in that storage facility when it detonated... We don't have it. It all went up. Everything. The suspect, who might have answers, got away. And John was the only one who saw his face. So how long does he have left? Current rate of crystallization, cellular degradation... - How long? - Twenty-four hours. His brain will no longer be able to oxygenate itself. I'm so sorry... ...that I can't offer you a less dangerous solution. - What do you mean? - Didn't I mention it? Whatever you think you said, you didn't say. The synaptic transfer system, the shared dream state. What do you mean, shared dream state? The human brain generates a quantifiable electric field. I posited in 1976 that it is possible... ...to synchronize the fields of two distinct minds... ...to allow the sharing of information across the unconscious state. Like a string between two tin cans. And you know what's great about that is that it's completely insane. You're saying I can talk to John in a coma... ...and he can tell me what the suspect looks like? - It's not an exact science. PETER: It's not even science. - Have you done this before? - I have used this technique... ...to extract information from a corpse, once. You can do that if they haven't been dead for six hours. Right, because after six hours, they're really dead. You could access his memories. Assuming there's no brain damage. Of course, you'd have to have an electromagnetic probe... ...placed in the base of your skull... ...whilst immersed without clothing in the old tank. And you'd be heavily drugged. - What sort of drugs? - A mix of... ...Ketamine, Neurontin, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide. That last one is LSD by the way. Acid? It'd take a few hours. I'd need your help to synthesize it. - If it's not too much trouble. - Sure, sounds fun. The man who was released from the mental institution... ...wants to give you an overdose, stick a rod in your head... ...and put you naked into a rusty tank of water. No, I don't want to. No, I'd rather not. I'm just saying I can. Okay, Olivia. Heh. Excuse me. You're obviously under severe duress. You haven't slept since Iraq, the man you care about might die. - But I'm telling you, that will kill you. - You don't understand the procedure. John would do it for me. Set it up. I'll get DHS authorization to bring John here. This is un believable. This is insane. He is insane. And you're insane for following him. Excellent. Let's make some LSD. OLIVIA: Put him over here. ASTRID: Salt'll make you float. Charlie, did you get me in to see William Bell? Massive Dynamic isn't exactly being forthcoming or courteous. And apparently William Bell is out of the country. What's this? A sweet little memo from their general counsel. - Bell doesn't wanna talk? - Or he's the head... - ...of a 50-billion-dollar corporation. - Screw this. I wanna drive a tank through Bell's office. Find out what he knows. I know you do, but I'm here to tell you the bad news. It's gonna be 48 hours till we get a court order. You should probably strip to your underwear. Hello. What the hell was that? Charlie, we don't have 48 hours. I need you to get to Bell. If Walter fails, Bell could be the only one to save us. What...? Livvy, what's happening here? You've cleared all this with Broyles? - Somewhat. - " Somewhat" doesn't sound good. (MOOS) - Is that a cow? - Yeah, that's Gene. Listen, Charlie, I need you to promise me you'll do whatever you can. Of course, you know that. Hey, be careful. My God. WALTER: Now, where was I? Could you tilt your head forward please. I still think that this is deeply irresponsible... ...and believe me, I would know. This is an anesthetic. I feel normal. Working. Yeah, because bootlegging smack in the basement is just the picture of normalcy. (GASPS) I got you. I got you. I hope your guy is worth it. And this... ...will rip open your consciousness. Listen. In case you don't come back... ...I just wanted to say, before we do this... ...how much I appreciate what you've done. There are so many things you lose in a place like that. You lose being trusted. It's strange how important that is, once it's gone. If you want to watch, you can come closer. - Do you work here? - Yeah, I'm Astrid Farnsworth. - Assistant to Agent Dunham. - Who? Oh, yes. I'm Walter... - Bishop. Walter Bishop. - Yes, thank you. Don't mention it. These are her brain rhythms. More important than most people know regarding cerebral regional interaction. Critical. And, uh... And these are his. As the drugs take effect... ...the probes will synchronize the electrical signals from both. That's what the brain is, an electrical router. Should be able to be interpreted by the other. Ha, ha. Yeah. Simple, really, like making taffy. And when the rhythms are in sync, they should be in the same place... ...so to speak. So, what do we do now? Now we wait. What was that? Hello? Hello? I think I'm here. I think I'm here. I'm here. John? That's my uncle's kayak. John? Is that you? JOHN: Olivia. John. - What's happening? WALTER: It's fine. - She's all right? - She's fine. - You're sure? - Look. I was just thinking about you. What was that? Nothing. John. You were hurt. I don't remember. Think. The storage units. I feel cold. I need you to remember. Remember what? What you saw. I need you to show me his face. Why? So I can save you. Please try. Try and remember. Yes, this is right. This is right. JOHN: We got a runner in the back. We need him alive. OLIVIA: I can't see his face. (YELLS) I saw him. I saw John get hurt. I was there. I was there. I saw... I saw him. (PANTING) What do you mean, you saw him? Where? I told you not to ask me that. This is him. This is the suspect. - He looks like this. - Send me the image. - I'll put it through the database. - Have you slept? You look like crap. No primary matches for criminal record. Crosscheck state driver's license files. Send this image to local hospitals. Agent Dunham, take a look at this. Oh, my God, this is him. - He was a passenger on Flight 627. - I don't understand. He couldn't have been at the storage place. - Charlie, I saw him there. AGENT: Hold on, guys. Morgan Steig was passenger number 108. His emergency contact: Richard Steig. - You're telling me he has a twin? AGENT: Yeah. No address. Only a history of employment. CHARLIE: What? - Richard Steig's last employer. OLIVIA: I was hoping to speak with William Bell. NINA: I'm Nina Sharp, executive director. I only have a few minutes. OLIVIA: Our primary suspect is a former employee of yours... ...Richard Steig, who may have used research from your company... ...to develop a self-eradicating airborne toxin. We don't know why or for whom... ...but it appears he was willing to sacrifice his own brother. Whatever killed those people got on board through his insulin pen. So do you wanna talk to me? Danielle... ...please assemble everything we have on Richard Steig for Agent Dunham here. I remember Richard Steig. He worked in our weapons-systems research lab. He was caught three months ago trying to leave with classified information. He was terminated. We referred his name to the justice department. We have done our due diligence, Agent Dunham... ...and if you choose to drag our company... ...and Dr. Bell's name into this matter... ...you will be hearing from our attorneys. - How long have you worked for Dr. Bell? - Sixteen years. I owe Massive Dynamic my life, and that is not an exaggeration. I was a runner most of my life. In the '97 Boston Marathon, I felt strangely tired. One day at the office, Dr. Bell noticed my discomfort... ...and insisted I go for a CAT scan. Cancer. It spread so severely... ...I had to have my arm amputated that week. That first scanner that found my cancer was built by this company. The robotic assist tools used in my surgery... ...the drugs I took afterwards... ...were developed and manufactured by Massive Dynamic... ...and my replacement limb was designed by Bell himself. Everything we have on Richard Steig. Do you believe that Steig may be part of The Pattern? I'm sorry, part of the... Part of the pattern? Oh, I assumed you had clearance. Well, I'm cleared to know whatever you're cleared to know. Apparently not. Suffice to say that we've reached a point where science and technology... ...have advanced at such an exponential rate for so long... ...it may be way beyond our ability to regulate and control them. You should know what you're getting into, Agent Dunham. I would say this to my own daughter: Be careful... ...and good luck. (WALTER LAUGHING) - And this is a show for children? - Yeah, it's huge. (PHONE RINGS) Surprisingly profound for a narrative about a sponge. Crazy house. I just landed at Logan. I'm on my way. I think we located our suspect. Hold on a second. You found the guy? The guy from your dream? I'm picking you up. I need your father to get information he needs... ...so he can make the cure. I need you in case your father's... Say no more. Meet you out front. AGENT 1: Clear! AGENT 2: Clear! AGENT 3: Clear! AGENT 1: In the back! (ANIMALS SCREECHING) WALTER: I'd like to check your blood pressure. Why don't you check your own blood pressure? Mine's fine, thanks. Your skin tone suggests you might be suffering from arterial hypertension. Don't tell me what I'm suffering from. And there are no visible signs of hypertension. When this is over, please don't send me back. - I don't want to go back. - Look, Walter... This experience, you... You woke me up again, and, heh. - You can't put me back to sleep. - It was hardly my idea, any of it. Whatever punishment you think I deserve... ...I swear, I have already endured it... ...seventeen years. Please... ...son. (DOOR CREAKS) Hey! - Hey! - What? Hey! He's in the alley! - Can I get out of the car? - Stay right there, Walter. (HORNS HONKING) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) We've got some questions for you. OLIVIA: U.S. Code 1111: murder of 147 passengers. U.S. Code 2332A: use of weapons of mass destruction. U.S. Code 2332B: an act of terrorism transcending national borders. U.S. Code 1113: attempted murder of a federal agent. You want immunity? I want a detailed account of all the synthetic chemicals... ...you had in that storage facility. Write them down... ...and then we can talk about an agreement. I have nothing to say. Walter, stay here. Where are you...? The compound affecting Agent Scott, it's water-soluble, right? We might not know what it is, but we know what it does... ...so if I wanted to... ...I could extract the contaminated fluids from his body. That would allow me to slip it to you whenever I wanted to. In your food... ...cup of coffee... ...the toilet. Nobody would ever know how it happened. The only problem is, the woman who was just in here... ...that's her friend who's dying... ...so I just don't have that kind of time. No. (SC REAMS) - Tell me the chemicals now. - Hey, stop. You can't. - You can't do that. - No, no. You can't do that. I want the names of the chemicals. I'm gonna count to one. - One. - Aah! The active toxin was a magnesium-based ethylene glycol. - I understand. You're not listening. WALTER: An ethylene glycol... - ...with an organophosphate trigger. - Walter, stop. His blood won't be able to absorb it before side effects kill him. So you're saying what? We synthesize a calcium gluconate in a thiamine base? - Yes, exactly. - We can't. We need more of his blood. - We have none. - Not true. Agents are required... ...to set up a backup blood supply in case we're wounded. - Autologous transfusion. Brilliant. PETER: Transfusion. We create the antidote and dissolve it into Scott's stored blood. If we transfuse him intravenously, his body won't be overwhelmed. WALTER: A-plus, boy. Well done. Let's begin. - So I got the lab. - Heh. Yeah, I know you did. Thanks. How's it going downstairs? Uh... Bishop says it'll be a while, but that it's looking auspicious. That was his word. - What? - You've done some solid work here: Locating Bishop... ...getting him out, finding a way to get him to work with you. - We're impressed. - Who's " we"? What happened on that plane might be part of something more dangerous... - ...than just simple terrorism. - " Simple" terrorism? In the past nine months, there have been three dozen incidents... ...like the Hamburg flight. John Thompson, normal kid, went missing back in '98... ...reappeared last month halfway around the world. Hadn't aged a day. In the past few months, 46 other children... ...who went missing that same year turn up. Same story. Fisherman off the coast of Sri Lanka reports a low-flying plane... ...emitting a high-pitched frequency that blows out all their windows. An hour later, same spot, an 8.7 subsurface earthquake... ...creates a tsunami that kills 83,000 people. - So why are you telling me...? - This man: Patient in Lisbon who woke up after years in a coma, began writing. Just numbers. They turn out to be exact, real-time coordinates... ...of our carrier battle groups in the Pacific. Intel that's classified above top secret. So how is that even possible? Come work for me. I'll get you the clearance... - Oh, stop. - There's more you need to hear. - You must not have heard me. - They're calling the events The Pattern... ...as if someone's experimenting, only the world is their lab. - You've seen. You know. - I don't wanna know. - I have a job. - This is a more important job. Anything, anybody you need, you can have. I like the job I've got, and the man I do it with... ...which you seem to have deduced on your own. Look around. You see all these people, going about their lives... ...no idea what's happening around them, what they're in the middle of? I just wanna go back to before. Dunham... ...I don't think you can. (GASPS) He's up. He's awake. Olivia, Olivia, he's awake. He's conscious. John? John? Can you hear me, baby? Baby? I had a dream about you. Change of clothes for Agent Scott. His vitals are surprisingly strong. - So, um, how long does he have to stay? - Until the melanocytes in his skin... ...have regenerated, but that shouldn't be more than a week. He owes you his life. We owe each other. What room is Steig in? I told you everything I know, didn't I? I gave you the names of all the synthetics I used in the compound. Don't worry, our immunity agreement holds. But there's still more to talk about, like why you killed your brother... - ...and who you're selling your work to. - Who says I was selling it? I was threatened by a guy from your office. You think I'm lying? I swear to God. I can prove it. - I recorded the conversation. - Where's the recording? I buried it. STEIG (ON RECORDER): Who is this? MAN (ON RECORDER): We had an exchange agreement. STEIG: Mm. There have been other bidders. Today, the airplane, was a demonstration. MAN: you've drawn unwarranted attention... ...something we can't afford to be connected with. you 're not selling to anyone else. you do that, we will come after you. - I will come after you. STEIG: you 're threatening me? After seeing what I'm willing to do to my own brother? MAN: Let me assure you, we'd be happy to treat you as family too. Let me assure you, we'd be happy to treat you as family too. Special Agent Scott. Yes, sir. Go right ahead. Charlie, I need two agents posted outside Agent Scott's room now. - Check on Steig. CHARLIE (OVER PHONE): I'm on it. OLIVIA: I'm five minutes away. We need this place locked down. This is Dunham. Agent ID 52776... ...in pursuit of blue SUV heading south on Fenway. Need immediate assist. (SIREN WAILING) (GROANING) Ask yourself... ...why. Why Broyles sent you... ...to the storage facility. Why you? I don't understand. Who are you working for? John, tell me. Tell me more, John. CHARLIE: I knew him just as long as you did. I'm sorry. Job isn't what it was 10 years ago. We're supposed to protect a world... ...where one breath of the wrong air can incinerate you from the inside out. I mean, how do we protect people... ...when corporations have higher security clearances than we do... ...when we're not fully briefed on half the things that we're investigating? You know, when the truth... The truth is... ...we're obsolete. Take me back to the lab. Can I talk to you, please? Yeah. I'll be back in a second. I, uh... I'm sure you're anxious to get as far away from here as possible. To Iraq or Afghanistan or countless other out-of-reach places... ...but, uh, I'm here to tell you your father needs to stay. Which means you need to, too. Are you okay? Now, I know that you have countless reasons... ...as to why this is a nonstarter for you... ...but, uh, your father is a good man. He's not the monster you think he is. You're good with him, despite what you think. And you're the only one who speaks Walter. We take him back to St. Claire's, and it's all over. - Where's John? - I can talk to the agency... ...and get them to clear your debts. I can take care of my own debts. But what just happened? Where is John? I'm not gonna use false threats with you anymore. I don't need to. The threats are real. After you left, my father sat down and started talking... ...and he was remarkably lucid. He told me about the work he and William Bell had done. And that incident... What happened on the plane is just the beginning. Which makes every part of me feel like I gotta get the hell out of Boston. WALTER: Are we leaving? Are we leaving? - How long has he been dead? NURSE: Five hours. Question him.
