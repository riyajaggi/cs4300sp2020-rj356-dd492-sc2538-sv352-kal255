 (VAN DOOR CLOSES) (GROANING) (ENGINE REVVING) (TIRES SQUEALING) (HORN HONKING) (BELL JINGLES) (BELL JINGLES) Hey, do you need a menu? (COUGHING) Are you okay? Do you want some food? There's a wicked-good vegetable soup.

 - Hey, give me a soup. - Onion? No, vegetable. No one likes the onion. And call Marty, would you? Marty, how come? There's some woman here who might be in trouble. She might need some help. Here you go. Thank you. BEN: I used to love those crackers. When I was a kid, my mom would get pissed... ...because when we went out to eat, I'd eat three packs... ...before the food came, and then I'd be stuffed. What happened there? Not that it's any of my business. - I'll leave you alone if you like. - I'm trying to remember.

 (DOOR OPENS, BELL JINGLES) (BELL JINGLES) - I was at Thurber's. - Hey, Marty. I'll just have a soda. How you doing tonight? You live around here? I do. I live in the area. Haven't seen you around. No, no, no. I was born in Boston. Oh, yeah? You were born there? So where do you live now? Where's home? I don't remember. They... They did things. Who did things? I... I don't... I don't know. They... - They gave me a red medicine. - Yeah? So, what was the red medicine? They didn't tell me. It's all right. And a blue one. There was blue. (SHIVERING) They confused me. They... ...hurt me and... Ma'am, I think you should come with me. - No. - I can help you. - No. - No, no, no. You're not in any trouble. - Stop it! - You need to talk to somebody. (SOBBING) Stop it! Please. Please, stop. (SOBBING CONTINUES) This is Officer Pitts. I've got a 5150. Can you make sure that Hannah's available tonight, please? BEN: Aah! Aah! - Ben. (PEOPLE GROANING) I need an ambulance at the diner right away! Now! What the hell is this? (PEOPLE GROANING AND SCREAMING) What the hell is...? Aah! (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING STOPS) Fringe s1e06 The Cure (ELECTRICITY HUMMING) (WALTER IMITATES HUMMING SOUND) - What? - Oh, that doesn't bother you? (CONTINUES HUMMING) PETER: Are you kidding? That man falls asleep counting pi to the 101 st digit. That's soothing. OLIVIA: Walter. (STOPS HUMMING) Was I humming? Heh. I thought it was in my head. It wasn't. Forgive me, Olivia. Nothing sings like a kilovolt. Unique pitch. Nothing else in nature quite like it. I'm sure you're right. - What's up? What's on your mind? - Short fuse today, I guess. Indeed. The tension in your voice indicates... ...that you're carrying a heavy psychic burden. Tortured by the... PETER: Hey, Walter, I think she liked it better when you were humming. BROYLES: The incident occurred approximately six hours ago. All we've determined so far... ...is that they were exposed to high levels of radiation. Emily Kramer. Last night was the first time anyone's seen her in two weeks... ...since she was reported missing by her parents. Police officer... ...responded to a psych disturbance, explaining the handcuffs. - They think she was a runaway? - Her parents say no. They say she was perfectly happy. In fact, she'd just been accepted to a master's program she was excited about. The level of radiation coming from Emily's body... ...is almost three times as great as the rest. Are you saying that she was the source? BROYLES: Don't know. Dr. Bishop, any thoughts? Yes. Where can I get one of those white suits? (BELL JINGLES) Oh... (ZIPPER OPENING) Oh, yeah. PETER: There's no head. WALTER: She was sick. Most likely Bellini's Lymphocemia. Striped bruising on her neck and upper arms, scratch in her torso. You know what he's talking about? Bellini's Lymphocemia. It's an autoimmune disease. Irreversible. The body destroys its muscles and organs. - Meaning, it's fatal? - Yeah. But I've never seen Bellini's cause a victim to lose her head. And what's more curious, this woman seems to have been in remission. Cured, even. The rash appears to be healing, the bruises receding. I'm gonna hate myself for asking this, but how do you cure a disease... - ...that's incurable? - I haven't the slightest idea. Though I, myself, once cured this one in a dream. Opium. Fantastic stuff. Of course, I forgot how I did it as soon as I woke up. - Aah! Thanks for the warning. - One hundred twenty-one degrees. That's counter-indicative for a hemorrhagic tumor. Most likely water molecules excited all at once. He means the guy's brain was boiled. WALTER: Like a Maine lobster. I need this body and the headless one taken back to my lab. OLIVIA: Walter, her disease... If there's no cure...? That's a question. And one which we should pose to whoever was treating her. Which makes three questions, the other one being... ...what exactly happened here? - That's only two questions. - Oh, really? Oh, the third question. Um... Could I get some of this onion soup? It looks delicious. (SIREN WAILING) MAN: Agent Dunham? Nadim Patel. Pleasure to meet you. Thank you for taking the trouble to talk to me. Of course. I'm told you have news about Emily Kramer. Unfortunately, I do. Emily was found dead last night. What? How? I'm not at liberty to discuss that with you. Forgive me, I'm just... Emotional investment in patients. It's an occupational hazard. Her poor parents must be devastated after everything they've been through. Yes, and I hate troubling you about this, but we understand that Emily... ...was suffering from a fatal disease that had recently gone into remission. That's right. Do you have any idea how that's possible? Medically, no. Were you treating her with any sort of radiation therapy? Radiation? No. Why? The circumstances surrounding Emily's death were unusual. It's possible that her condition may have been a factor. I'll get you her records, if that'll help. Yeah. She was finally starting to live again. PETER: Do I really need to be here? Couldn't you just use a clamp? WALTER: Of course I could... ...but I enjoy the company. Quality time, as they say. This is like throwing around the old pigskin. - What's that smell? - Hyacinth. My third favorite flower. Associated in mythology with rebirth, which in this case is cruelly ironic. - It's coming from her? - Indeed. Which indicates either a mutation at the genetic level... ...or she was eating flowers, perhaps her perfume. - How's it coming? - Oh, Olivia, join us. We've learned some things already. We don't think she ran away. WALTER: Ligature marks. - So she was being held against her will. That or she had a proclivity for sexual bondage. Scientific observation, not a judgment. Some of my fondest memories... Oh! Walter, stop. Wherever that's going, it's just wrong. WALTER: There's also this. Subcutaneous injection marks. She was being given medicine intravenously. So whoever was holding her captive was giving her drugs. Yes, but not the enjoyable kind. In fact... ...quite unlike anything I have ever seen before. You okay? Should I be? So how'd she end up in the diner? Did she escape? Perhaps not. There are two distinct methods of scientific experimentation... ...lab trials or field trials. You're suggesting they may have let her go on purpose? Whoever did this wanted to be sure what they did was working. There was something inside her that killed those people, in her... Noggin? I'm not sure yet. It's a theory. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Obviously, I'll be more certain once we identify the substance... ...or when whoever did this tries to repeat their results. You mean, if they take another woman? Judging by Agent Dunham's body language... ...I'd say she's receiving that very news. Okay. CHARLIE: Missing Persons called in another case four hours ago. Claire Williams, diagnosed with Bellini's Lymphocemia three years ago. Someone's targeting people with the disease? That, or it's one hell of a coincidence. (RINGS DOORBELL) Hey, Liv... ...I get it. You get what? Young woman, what was done to her... ...you know, this coming your way, today of all days. (RINGS DOORBELL) It's okay. I'm okay. Listen... ...I know you don't like to celebrate... ...but happy birthday. OLIVIA: Ken Williams? Olivia Dunham, Charlie Francis, FBI. Claire. Did you find her? I'm afraid we don't have new information... ...but we do need to ask you a few questions. Her name is Emily Kramer. She suffered from the same disease as your wife. You seen her before? Another case? - What happened to her? - Do you know her, Mr. Williams? No, I-I-I don't think so. We don't know anyone else with Bellini's. I mean, what we went through fighting Claire's disease... ...and the constant pain. When the lesions started appearing, she stopped going out. The damn disease almost took everything from us, even our marriage. Then... ...it was like a miracle. - A miracle? KEN: She started getting better. The pain went away. - She went into remission? - About six weeks ago. She was herself again. And now... Please find my wife. Please find her for me. (SOFTLY) Oh. What's happening? (CRYING) Please don't hurt me. (CRYING) The last one was a test. This one counts. She a candidate? Even better. Let's get started, then. WALTER: To understand what happened at the diner, we'll use Mr. Papaya. Clear. This is upsetting, because he's the friendliest of fruits. (DEVICE HUMMING) WALTER: And we have goo-ification. Is that the scientific term? Wait... ...show's not over yet. (COW MOOS) This is what you think happened to the people at the diner? That beam emits high-energy microwaves... ...which caused Mr. Papaya's molecules to vibrate rapidly... ...causing friction and producing heat. It's like how a microwave oven cooks food... ...only in Emily Kramer's case, she was the oven. ASTRID: But then what killed Emily? This demonstration is far more effective with living tissue. I have some expendable gerbils in the back. - No. WALTER: Oh, no. It's no trouble. - I'm sure you'd like it. - Walter, just drop it. Wait, am I missing something? How is it that Emily is cooking people? In her blood, I found traces... ...of radioactive isotopes, Strontium-90. I believe that these microscopic capsules are designed... ...to release just the right amount of radiation at specific times... ...to cure her disease. So you think these capsules saved her life? Think of it like time-release chemotherapy. Oh, yes. But in Emily's case... ...the cure also made her a perfect candidate for weaponization. Whatever was injected into her bloodstream... ...caused these capsules to burst all at once... ...sending out a microwave blast... ...and, perhaps, given that her own head was the source of energy, kaboom. So Emily's rheumatologist, Dr. Patel... ...would he have access to these sorts of isotopes? It's doubtful. They only use them in a couple therapies. They're strictly regulated. Why? You think Patel had something to do with this? I don't know... ...but 83 percent of kidnap victims are abducted by someone they know. I'm gonna go and talk to Emily Kramer's parents. - I'll come with you. - Oh, Peter. If you're going out could you bring me back some cotton candy? - Cotton candy? - Yeah. Blue, not pink. I've got a craving. Must be the hyacinths. Lovely blue flowers. You're probably way ahead of me on this already. I'm noticing uncomfortable similarities between this and other incidents lately. More humans being used as guinea pigs. My point is, if this is part of the pattern... ...what if these people aren't just experiments? What if somebody is preparing for something? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Maybe we should come back later. Before or after they do to Claire Williams what they did to Emily Kramer? Olivia, this is a wake. These people are mourning their child. No. Don't you need a warrant for this? Hey, Olivia, stop. Okay, crashing a wake is bad enough, but rifling through a dead girl's things? It's the only hope we have of finding a solid lead, so please, help me. What is it that we're looking for? Anything. Any connection she may have had... What are you doing in here? Who are you? What are you doing in my daughter's room? Mrs. Kramer, we're terribly sorry about your loss. We're with the FBI. FBI? Today, you come here today? Mrs. Kramer, please listen to me. Another girl's life is at stake. - What other girl? - Her name is Claire Williams. Claire? What's happened to Claire? You know her? A therapist... ...told her to write through the pain and the alienation... ...and she felt it was all she had. Until the treatments. - The treatments? KRAMER: For her Bellini's. Emily and Claire both had the disease. That's how they met. Here. They became such good friends. (KNOCKING) Why'd you lie to me, Mr. Williams? We met Emily at the hospital, waiting for blood tests. She and Claire started talking... ...sharing horror stories about their disease. They became friends. One night over dinner, the conversation turned out... ...that medical establishment had abandoned us. See, there's only 3000 people in this country with Bellini's. Not enough for the drug companies to make a profit. So they're not looking into developing a cure. We've started talking to other people who have the disease... ...a microbiologist, an investment banker... ...a mother, a professional athlete. Started thinking about what we could do if we pooled our resources. Claire and Emily were treating themselves? We didn't have a choice. We were desperate. We tried radical therapies normal doctors wouldn't touch. Three months ago, we found the cure. Time-release radioactive capsules. I don't understand. Why lie? Because the people we love are depending on it. I couldn't take the chance you'd stop that. Claire wouldn't want that. It's what gave us our lives back. Mr. Williams, we will need the names of the other patients involved. I could give you some, but I don't know all of them. You'll have to ask Dr. Nadim Patel. Emily's doctor? - He knew this was going on? - He cared enough to help us. The medication... ...do you have a sample? (CLAIRE MOANING) Is that my Bellini's medication? Tell me what you're doing. Please, just tell me what you're doing to me. We know all about your disease, Claire. We know that this... ...makes you better. But this... This will make you special. (CLAIRE WHIMPERS) PATEL: What is this? When I told you there were unusual circumstances in Emily's death... - ...these were the circumstances. - I don't understand. We know how it worked, Dr. Patel. Ken Williams told us everything. What we don't know is who else was involved. I'm not responsible for this. Not this. - All I do is give them updates. - Who's "they"? - Who's "they"? - Intrepus. - The drug company? - You should just walk away. You have no idea who you're dealing with... I need a name, Dr. Patel. Dr. Patel? Dr. Patel? - Drop it. - It was only supposed to be updates. Dr. Patel, put the gun on the ground now. Do you want a name? - David Esterbrook. - No! (GUNSHOT) (EXHALES) Hey... ...I found him. David Esterbrook, he heads up Intrepus Pharmaceutical Research division. By all accounts... ...he's solely responsible for a guns-blazing Congressional lobbying campaign... ...that allowed Intrepus to dig into some of their more controversial R and D. Define "controversial." CHARLIE: Prenatal gene therapy... ...human-animal hybridization studies... ...viral warfare. All the fun stuff. He's in Manhattan today. He's speaking on the humanitarian-aid forum. Listen, Liv... ...even if the doctor was right... ...even if Esterbrook had something to do with those women... ...l'll go out on a limb and say he's not gonna confess. I want to see it in his eyes, Charlie. I need to know it's him. OLIVIA: Mr. Esterbrook... ...sorry to interrupt. Amanda Bennet, Baxil. Listen, at the risk of sounding sycophantic... ...I followed your work since Yale. Three degrees including a PhD... ...in medicinal neurobiology. I couldn't even get through Biochem without cheating off my roommate. (MEN CHUCKLING) I'm sorry. This must sound insanely naive to you. ESTERBROOK: No, hardly. Science and technology have reached a point where... ...our means are finally catching up with our imagination. And the only thing preventing us from doing truly visionary work... ...are these moral-based restrictions... ...that lawmakers put up in the name of public policy. That and money. We always need more money. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, Amanda. It isn't about the money. It is about the resolve. I haven't been entirely honest with you. I don't work for Baxil, but I do know a colleague of yours. Dr. Nadim Patel. - How is Nadim these days? - These days? Dead. I'm sorry to hear that. Not as sorry as I was to watch it happen. Identity theft is a federal crime, Amanda. So is kidnapping and murder. - And it's Agent Dunham. - What did you hope to get... - ...out of this conversation? - I already got it. How old are you? Twenty-eight, 29? You're an attractive young woman. I'm sure you want to start a family one day. It would be a shame if anything got in your way. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Broyles. When? BROYLES: Dunham. OLIVIA: Hey. I understand you paid a little visit to David Esterbrook. - News travels fast. I was just about to... - In public, in a hotel bar. I didn't realize my interview techniques were under such close scrutiny. Everything we do is under close scrutiny. This task force that you're now part of, at best it's controversial. We need to be perfect. Trying to intimidate such a high-profile suspect... - ...in a murder investigation is reckless. - Claire Williams... ...is a prisoner right now, having God knows what injected into her body. And David Esterbrook knows where she is. He's guilty, and he just assumes he'll get away with it. So excuse me, but right now, I couldn't give a damn about politics. Which is exactly your problem, and now mine. You think you're the only one who wants to find Claire Williams? You violated the code and the law of our profession. You let your feelings drive your decision-making. You've endangered not only Claire, but everything we're trying to do here. If I can't trust you to control your own passion, Dunham, then I can't trust you. Is that clear? You'll have my report on the Esterbrook interview within the hour. I'll be waiting. Is there anything else you'd like me to run past you? Not anything, everything. (CRYING) (RAT SQUEAKING) (CLAIRE CRYING) How's it going? - She's almost ready. - The capsules in her bloodstream... - ...they can be triggered remotely? - Everything's as requested. She'll be stable and ready for transport by morning. I'll call the client and schedule delivery. Well done. (RAT SQUEAKING) (BONES CRUNCHING) What's happening to me? - Hey. How's it going? - It's great. Esterbrook's our only lead... ...to where they're holding Claire Williams, and I can't get to him. I mean, the guy's cleaner than snow. Not even as much as an unpaid parking ticket. Well, I think we actually might be making some progress. Walter thought he might have isolated the compound in Emily Kramer's blood... ...but he got distracted by the unicorn running through the lab. Funny. Anything else? Any more jokes? Something's been bugging you all day. Something other than Claire Williams. That's okay. Know what? We're allowed to have our bad days. What's not fine, is blaming it on me. I want to find her as much as you do. You're right. I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry. Fine. I had a stepfather. When he drank, he'd accuse my mom of seeing other men, and then he'd hit her. And she just lived with it. She never called the police, not once. And then one day, he beat her really bad and broke her nose. I was nine. He stormed out of the house, got in his car, drove off. And my mom's crying, I can't help her. And then I hear his car. He's turned back around. He kept a gun in the drawer, near his bed. When he opened the door, I pulled the trigger. And then I pulled it again. And I can still see his face... ...almost daring me to finish. But I couldn't. So they took him to the hospital and said that he couldn't be saved... ...but he didn't die. He recovered. And then one night, he just slipped away. We never saw him again. I still blame myself, because I should have done it. I should have killed him. I know, rationally, he's not responsible for all the bad things in the world... ...but he is responsible for some of them. And every year, he sends me a card on my birthday... ...just to let me know that he's still out there. It's your birthday today. No man is untouchable, Olivia. You really want Esterbrook, all you have to do is talk to your friend Nina Sharp. Massive Dynamic has three separate pharmaceutical divisions. They're all in direct competition with Intrepus. Their annual budget for corporate espionage could feed a mid-sized nation. I guarantee you she has something on David Esterbrook. - Even if you're right, I can't go to her. - Why not? Because despite their annual budget, corporate espionage is wildly illegal. You really think that she'd admit that to me? It's here somewhere. I know it is. I just have to look harder. - I'm going out. - Okay. Oh, Peter. To be honest, I didn't even know you were here. (DOOR CLOSES) NINA: Thank you. Excuse me. Ms. Sharp. - Hi, I'm Peter... - Peter Bishop, Walter Bishop's son. You're not the only one who's done your homework. What can I do for you, Mr. Bishop? Well, I was hoping I could take a moment of your time. Does Ms. Dunham know you're here? No. No, she doesn't know I'm here. Well, Peter, suppose we take a walk. You're suggesting that Intrepus is conducting... ...illegal drug trials with human beings. That is a rather bold claim to make, Mr. Bishop. How are you able to substantiate your information? Would you put it past them? Let's assume for a second that what I'm saying is true. Where would they do it? They wouldn't risk using... ...one of their own testing facilities. It'd have to be some place off the grid. You still look the same as you did when you were a child. I doubt you'll remember, but you and I spent a good deal of time together. Some of it right here. Your father and I were quite close when we were both much younger. Now, I have all kinds of information, Peter. And some of it does me no good. Well, take the Aymara people, for instance, of central Peru. I know that the soil beneath their land... ...houses a naturally occurring metal alloy... ...that is potentially hyperconductive. I also know that you have managed to successfully conduct business... ...with these and other tribal concerns... ...in parts of the world traditionally resistant to development. I'm sorry, Ms. Sharp, I think I must've missed your question. My question is, are you willing to make a bargain? I give you the exact location you want, and in exchange... ...I get to come to you someday. And you return the favor. No questions asked. Do we have a deal? (BELL TOLLING) (SNIFFING) - Do you smell that? - Yes. And next time, how about a little warning? Huh? (CHUCKLES) Oh. Not that. Methyl eugenol. The chemical responsible for giving hyacinths their aroma. Well, what about it? I've been trying to determine what caused the radioactive capsules... ...in Emily Kramer's bloodstream to burst at once. - This is it, Asterisk. PETER: Astrid. Her name is Astrid. I've got it, Peter. Methyl eugenol is the key. That's what they injected her with. That's why these women were chosen. By itself, harmless. But given their treatments... Causing all the capsules to burst at once. They made her radioactive. They turned her into a weapon. It would be a decidedly blue compound. And now that I... Yes. Yes. That's it. I've found the agent that will work. - That will interfere with the process. - How long? - How long will it take to make the cure? - Oh, not long at all, now that I know. Where's Olivia? (FOOTSTEPS) When did this happen? When did this become the world we live in? Patel. Esterbrook. These are the people we trust to take care of us. 5620 Stapleton Avenue. The facility where Claire Williams is being held. How could you possibly even...? Radioactive isotopes have a heat signature visible to spy satellites. Had a friend track it down, National Recon Office. You have a friend at the NRO? I have a friend who's cracked their control systems. Peter, if I pull the trigger on this, and the information's bad... It's good. It's good. Charlie, I've got a solid lead. The strike team. Full tactical. PETER: How we doing? - Almost there. We're sure this is the one. We've got a visible heat signature from the isotope. Visible heat signatures? Radioactive isotopes don't give off... Walter. Walter. How we doing? Oh, um, Olivia. - This is the antidote. - Okay, Charlie. We're coming now. Listen to me. You must inject this directly into her bloodstream. - In the jugular, preferably. OLIVIA: Okay. CHARLIE: Facility's located on the southern edge of Framingham. Surveillance teams reported armed security on the premises. We're expecting resistance. So this will be a tactical entry. OLIVIA: Our main objective is securing the victim: Claire Williams. Judging from the layout, it's likely she's being held at the basement levels. We'll enter through the northwest. Alpha team will enter through the front to clear out the west of the building. Bravo team will clear the lower levels. Are we clear? Then let's make this happen. AGENT 1: FBI! You're under arrest. Get down. - Stay where you are. AGENT 2: Hands behind your head. AGENT 3: Room's clear! (AGENTS YELLING INDISTINCTLY) AGENT 4: Look out. Man down. We need immediate medevac. Call it in. Stay with him. - Level's secure. We got a few in custody. - Any sign of Claire? - No. - Okay, I'm going down. Watch yourself. CHARLIE: FBI! (AGENTS YELLING INDISTINCTLY) Step away from that, please. Where is she? Where is Claire Williams? AGENT 5: Dunham, you can't go in that room. The radiation will kill us all. Claire? Claire, my name's Olivia Dunham. I'm with the FBI. I know you're scared, but I need you to listen to me. I need you to come to the door. I can't come in. My head. OLIVIA: Claire, listen to me. That's medicine. I need you to come to the door and take it. I can't come in there. (SCREAMING) Claire. Claire. Look at me. That's good. Now come to the door. Keep coming. I need you to take this syringe. I'm gonna tell you what to do. Good. Claire. (MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY) OLIVIA: Claire? Look at me, Claire. I'm right here with you. Claire? Claire, right now you need to jab yourself in the side of your neck. Oh, my God, my head. Claire? Claire, come on. Claire, do it. You can do this. Do it. I know you can do this. Stab it in. (SCREAMS) (CRYING) Good, Claire. (BEEPING SLOWING DOWN) (INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO) Agent Dunham. Apparently, I didn't make my point clearly enough. I thought you'd be interested to know that Claire Williams is safe. Can't say I'm familiar with that name. That's odd. Because an employee of yours, Elizabeth Sarnoff... ...just admitted that you supplied her with the facility and the equipment... ...to make Emily Kramer and Ms. Williams into human weapons. A disgruntled former employee will say just about anything... ...to vilify the boss that fired her. Then you won't mind coming with me to answer questions. Do you honestly see this going anywhere, Agent Dunham? I have a law firm on retainer that charges more by hour than you make in a year. Then I suggest you get them to meet you at the FBI. I will include police harassment in the litany of charges I will file against you. I'm still gonna walk you out that door in handcuffs for resisting questioning. So the press that I tipped off... ...can splash your picture all over the news. Now, you may not answer to me or the federal government... ...but you do answer to a board of directors. And I wonder what their response will be when they have their company... ...dragged into the middle of a murder investigation. Oh! - I guess by now you've heard. - That you frogmarched a senior officer... ...of a multibillion-dollar conglomerate out of his office? Yeah, I heard. Quite a few cameras there. The press. They always get their pound of flesh. I understand that you think I acted too emotionally. Putting aside that men always say that about women they work with... ...l'll get straight to the point. I am emotional. I do bring it into my work. It's what motivates me. It helps me get into the head space of our victims... ...see what they've seen... ...even if I don't want to, even if it horrifies me. And I think it makes me a better agent. If you have a problem with that, I'm sorry. You can fire me. But I hope you don't. You're not getting off that easy, Agent Dunham. I'll see you in the morning. WOMAN (OVER RADIO): ...a spike in the price of oil again... ...sent tremors through the financial markets. But for pure shock value, nothing beat today's very public detainment... ...of Intrepus, David Esterbrook by the FBI. Intrepus stock is being absolutely pummeled in overnight trading... ...and analysts predict it'll open at $23 a share. That's a 10-year low... ...which, of course, is very good news for Intrepus, competitors... ...most notably, Massive Dynamic. Shares of MD are up almost 12 percent... ...as investors flee to the most reliable brand in the sector. - Hey. - Olivia, did you lock yourself out again? Actually, Walter, this is our hotel. Oh. - I need to talk to you. - Sure. I'll see you upstairs, okay? It's nice to see you. Good night, Walter. And remember tonight, please, the red toothbrush is mine. White for Walter. That's me. - Right? - Yes. (PETER SIGHS) Everything okay? I know where you got your information... ...about Claire Williams. What was the price? What did Nina Sharp want in return? (CHUCKLES) Nothing untoward, if that's what you're worried about. Come on, you don't have to worry about me. I'm a big boy. I can take care of myself. You have been looking out for me, so I'm just returning the favor. Thank you. There was no letter today, was there? No. Happy birthday. You better get back upstairs before Walter falls asleep in your bed. Hmm. Yeah. He has actually done that before... ...while I was sleeping. Really not something you wanna wake up to. Good night. Good night. (KEYS JINGLING) Mm.
