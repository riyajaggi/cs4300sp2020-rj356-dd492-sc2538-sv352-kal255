 NARRATOR: Previously on Fringe: They're calling these events the Pattern. As if someone out there is experimenting, only the whole world is their lab. - You're saying I can talk to John? - You could access his memories. BROYLES: David Robert Jones was arrested in possession of state secrets. The people I work with are loyal to the end. Can you say the same? - Hello, Liv. - You're not real. - What's happening? - When you were in the tank... ...part of his memories crossed over into yours. (ELECTRICITY SURGING) Security camera's out. Disarming alarm.

 - How long do we have? - Confirming density and thickness. A minute, 41. - Forty. - Let's go. Six-ten, six-ten, six-ten. Okay, I got it. Give me a charge gel. - Fifty-seven seconds. - Oh, we gotta move. MAN 5: Thirty-five seconds. MAN 6: Get it up. (GRUNTING) - Get it over... Okay. MAN 7: I got it down. MAN 8: All right, let's move. MAN 9: Grab everything, and let's go. Let's go. I need help. Get it up. (GRUNTING) MAN 10: Okay, take it through. You got it? All right, I got it. (PANTING) They've gotta move, or they're not gonna make it. LOEB: Lugo, let's go. The magnet won't disengage. LOEB: Disengage it. We gotta go. - You go. I'm working on it. I'm right behind you. Fifteen seconds. What the hell is he doing? The magnet's stuck. - He can't leave that in there. - I think he understands that. Come on. (GRUNTING) We got slack. EASTWICK: Ten seconds, nine seconds... ...eight, seven... LUGO: I'm ready. Pull me through. - ...six, five seconds... ...four, three. - We've two seconds. Pull. - Come on, push yourself through. All right, pull me through! (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) Grab everything. Let's go. No. Help me. Please. (LUGO GRUNTS) LOEB: Let's go. MAN 1: Let's go! MAN 2: Secure that gear. I want nothing left behind. Fringe s1e10 Safe PETER: What do you mean you don't have one? Everybody's got one. Even I. WALTER: What's that? A spleen? PETER: Yeah, a spleen. WALTER: Unless one suffers from Asplenia, a rare genetic condition... ...in which one is born spleenless. PETER: Thank you, Walter. - You seriously don't have a best friend? - Nope. Well, does a sister count? - Of course a sister doesn't count. OLIVIA: Well, I've enjoyed being on my own. Even when I was at boarding school, they used to call me Han. As in Solo? Cute. At least you had a nickname. This is Phillip Broyles with Homeland Security. Have him call me soon. - Yes, and they'll connect you. WALTER: Oh. PETER: Clear the area, please. WALTER: This is fascinating. Security guard was killed, surveillance cameras disabled. - So, what do we have? BROYLES: Nothing. This may be related to a series of robberies. This would be the third. - All in Philadelphia? - First in Cleveland, second Baltimore. I was in Baltimore. I remember a woman... ...with particularly large breasts. Each time, the only thing taken has been an oversized safe-deposit box. All without so much as a breach to the vault. - Are the boxes traceable? - I have a call in to the bank manager now. The who, what and why? That's you. Just when you thought things couldn't get any weirder... Peter, I know this man. What, the guy in the wall? Really? Let me guess. He's your best friend. - No, I mean it. PETER: You know him from where? To determine what happened here, we'll have to cut him out of the wall. Or at least pieces of him. I'll need some of this netting too. Raul. Raul Lugo. - You know this man? - Yeah. - He was in my first unit in the Marines. - You have my condolences. - You're being serious? - Yeah. He's from Jersey. He's married, his wife's named Susan. He plays baseball. He lives in Edison. I've been to his house. EASTWICK: Bullet in the head or no... ...leaving a guy stuck in the wall wasn't the most professional. - I thought it was a nice touch. - You can joke all you want. Yeah, thanks. We had another grid. - We should've tried to get him. - How we doing? Crappy. Self-sealing bolts. Magnetic tumbler, some old-school chromo-alloy. - Someone didn't want this open. - How long? Couple hours. Maybe three. We have one more box to go. If you're bitching as your way of saying you want out, then go. Otherwise inject yourself and shut your mouth. (BUZZING) Mr. Kohl, please come in. WALTER: This is amazing. The scale of this hardware store is unprecedented. It's completely precedented. There are stores like this everywhere. - All around the world, in every city. - If anyone knows that, it's you. All right, what's that supposed to mean? - My last phrase? - Yes, your last phrase. "If anybody knows that, it's you." What is that? I was implying that you've traveled extensively. You were implying that I haven't stayed still in the last 15 years. You were implying, and you've been implying with increasing frequency... ...that you don't approve of my admittedly nomadic existence. You're saying you're disappointed I haven't made more out of life. - That's what you're implying. - Yes, I suppose so. The reason this store seems like such a miracle to you... ...is because you've been in a mental institution for two decades... ...which effectively does two things: One... ...it precludes you from knowing much about me. About who I am, who I've been, what I know, and what I've done. And two, it renders any fatherly judgments you may have of me moot. Are we clear? Can I help you guys find something? Yes. We're looking for an electric saw. Preferably, variable speed with an easily replaceable blade system. - What are you cutting, wood? - Human tissue. Flesh and bone. It's more sinuous than you may expect. It's really not that dire. Actually, potentially, it's far worse. I think that the saw you're looking for is around the corner next to the routers. Thank you. No need to call the police. KOHL: Mr. Jones, as you know, we only have so much time so... The sentencing is scheduled for next week. As I told you before, I think the best we can hope for is life. - However, I will be filing an appeal. - You spoke to my people? Do they have any news for me? Yes, they said that the job in Philadelphia was successful. Good. Please, tell them the following: They are to wire Mr. Loeb another $100,000... ...and to inform him of the location of the next item. - I'll pass that along. - Thank you. Here is the document. If you could just take a quick look at it. This is a standard document for appeal. If you'll just sign on the... What are you doing? Items that I will need upon your next visit. My people will provide them for you. " Dramamine. Suntan lotion." What are these for? As my employee, it really is none of your concern, now, is it? What size are you? Suit size? Forty long. Why? The address of my personal tailor. He'll fix up something nice for you. My way of saying thank you for all you've done for me. (DOORBELL RINGS) (DISTANT DOG BARKING) - Yes? OLIVIA: Susan. Yeah. Olivia. Olivia Dunham. Hello. I'm afraid I have some bad news. I just can't believe it. I just can't believe he's dead. Raul moved out about two years ago. We hadn't spoken in months. You know, I am so sorry. And please forgive me, but did he mention these robberies? No. Can't say I'm surprised, though. What do you mean? Ever since he came back from the war, he was just dark. Depression, drinking. And I tried to help the best way I could. - I swear to God, but... - I'm sure you did. And do you know anyone he was hanging out with? Any of his recent friends? Because I hadn't seen Raul in years. - You knew Raul? - Yes, of course. We served together in the Marines. Oh. - I didn't know. I... - We have met before. - Who? You and I? - Yes. We had dinner here. You were in my house? Now, it took a little while to remember because it was so long ago... ...but Raul and I met at Camp Pendleton. And we had dinner here, the night that he became first lieutenant. No. You weren't here. Susan, I'm sorry, but I was. And you were a wonderful host. You made pot roast... And it burned. Yes. And we had to order in. Yeah, and the delivery guy dropped the bag right here. And that piano was actually in front of the window... ...and the sofa was here by the fire. Yes, I remember. But you were not here. The day Raul made first lieutenant, it was just me, Raul, and John. Who? Raul's friend from Pendleton, John. - John who? - John Scott. Are you okay? (SAW BUZZING) Almost there, son. Get ready. You can do it. Nice catch. Well done. PETER: I'm carrying a tray, Walter. It's not exactly rocket science. WALTER: What I said before didn't come out as I intended. - What? The crack about the breasts? - No, about my disappointment in you. It's more to do with your potential than anything else. You have no idea what you're capable of, Peter. That's sweet, Walter, but ultimately unfair, especially coming from you. - So, what have we got here so far? - Nothing yet. If we examine this flesh at the cellular level... ...we figure out how they pass through solid matter. What we perceive as solid matter is mostly empty space. Just as we may perceive that a life is full... ...that is actually a series of empty encounters. He's been like that all day. It's been awesome. To accomplish this, your bank robbers would need... ...cutting-edge knowledge of quantum physics... ...not to mention technology... ...that would cost more than a dozen banks could hold. How'd it go with Raul Lugo's wife? They were separated, so she hadn't had much contact with him for months. But she said he'd suffered from depression. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm good. No, Peter's right. Your pupils are dilated. It's a symptom of high stress, unless you're using hallucinogens. - Are you tripping, Agent Dunham? - Walter. I didn't recognize Raul Lugo. John Scott did. You're confusing John Scott's memories... With my own. - So you never met this guy. - No. But I could've sworn I did. That... I don't understand that. I need to look into that. Okay, first we need to figure out what happened here. Who did this, what they want, and what they're gonna do next. - Success. - Nice job. - You gonna let us see what's in these? - I don't think so. And even if I did, you wouldn't understand. NINA: I thought we were making progress. TECHNICIAN: We were. But we've hit a dead end trying to reconstruct John Scott's memories. If we push further, we risk destroying the fragments we're trying to retrieve. Not to place any undue pressure on you and your team... ...but we're in a race against motivated individuals. Right now, John Scott is our only advantage. Understood. So why did you need me to go get all that rice? No talking. Walter, what's the rice for? What's with all the toys? These were in my storage. They're your toys from when you were a little boy. - Those aren't mine. - I suppose they must be mine. It's the netting, Peter. I believe the swatch left behind was from a larger piece... ...that was draped over the vault wall. That somehow is the key. Although, I'm not sure yet exactly how they would... Aha! Ha, ha, ha. Now, what do you see here? So far, some rice and a bunch of toys. This gentleman is standing on what appears to be solid. Hm? However, add vibration. - I'm quite envious of this. - Of what? Well, somehow the robbers were able to weaken the vault wall. High-frequency vibrations disrupting its atomic structure... ...allowing another piece of solid matter through it. Well, obviously what I'm showing you here... ...is a theoretical example. In actuality, this feat would be immensely complicated... ...and, apparently, not without consequences. It seems that use of this technology can render one slightly radioactive. - How slightly? - Well... ...not as slightly as I thought. Miss, uh, would you mind putting the hand on ice? It will help preserve the tissue. PETER: Just so I'm clear, Walter... ...the robbers have managed to violate the laws of the universe... - ...and they're also radioactive? - Who? Our robbers, apparently. Where you been? Been working. Where have you been? I've been buying rice for Walter's toys. Did you get any leads on the safety-deposit boxes? Yeah, they were all purchased 23 years ago, all paid for in cash. Bogus names on each account. - How radioactive? - Slightly. PETER: Though not as slight as Walter would like. We have no idea who those safety-deposit boxes belong to. No. And it's untraceable. Can you call hospitals in and around the Philadelphia area? Get them to call us if anyone comes in showing signs of radiation poisoning. - Yeah, I'm on it. - Okay. Okay. So, what's our next move? OLIVIA: Raul Lugo was a good kid before the military. Had a clean record, responsible employee. I wanna know how he became a criminal... ...why they recruited him and what they promised him. - So how are we gonna do that? - Lugo's wife gave me some names. It just so happens his best friend from high school works at a bar in Cambridge. Did I just hear " bar" and "Cambridge"? - Hey, Astrid, would you mind, uh...? - Watching Walter? I'm on that too. Now, miss, I'm going to repeat the demonstration with the rice. - Would you care to watch? - Nope. Okay. - Just go along with this, okay? - Sure thing, boss. - Hi. - Hey. OLIVIA: How's your night? - Had worse. What can I get? - Double shot of whiskey. DREW: What's your preference? - Your call. - You? Same as the lady. I'm Stephanie. This is my brother, Rick. - Hey, Brother Rick. - Hi. - You know, you look familiar. - Who, me? Cheers. Um... I'll take another. - Are you sure we haven't met before? - I don't think so. - What's your name? - Drew. Drew, I gotta tell you, I never forget a face. It's true, she doesn't. It's kind of creepy, actually. - I got it. Raul and Susan's wedding. - No way. You were there? - You were the best man. - Yeah. It's incredible. She's been able to do that since we were kids. Remember that? - I do. PETER: Yeah. - So do you still see them? - No, it's been years. I was friends with Susan in college, but we lost contact too. It's horrible. Where are they living now? - I don't know. I heard they split. - Oh, no. - Yeah, well, I'm not surprised. OLIVIA: Why not? I don't know. Raul got weird. - Weird how? - You know, he was in the Gulf War... ...and he sort of, I don't know, has post-traumatic stress or something. I feel bad. I'm sure I would've lost my mind if I'd gone to the Gulf War as well. Anyway, when he got back, he didn't come around much. - He started hanging at the V.A. - Which one? DREW: Don't know. WOMAN: Bartender. A shame. He was a good guy. Excuse me. Sure. (CLEARS THROAT) - Brother? - Uh-huh. Yeah. It, uh... It kind of works better that way. PETER: Does it, now? (PHONE RINGS) - Broyles. OLIVIA(ON PHONE): It's Dunham. I was wondering if you could find out what V.A. hospital... ...Raul Lugo might've gone to. - There was nothing in his records. - I know. That's why I'm calling. OLIVIA: Can you help me? I'll do what I can. I'll have an answer for you in an hour. Thanks. OLIVIA: Let's go. He'll want us back in an hour. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the rush? Two's your limit? Is that a dare? McNEIL: Rook, to E-seven. Check. NORTON: So I took a look at his papers while he was checking in that box. - So? NORTON: It's a map of Germany. - Germany? NORTON: Yeah, Frankfurt. Lines all over it. Latitude and longitude. It looked like he's planning a damn invasion. I got next. All right, listen up. We're headed out. - Let's go. - Where to? Providence. Pick a card. (OLIVIA CLEARS THROAT) All right. Now, I need you to memorize that card. - Okay. - You got it? - I got it. - You sure? - Absolutely positive. - Absolutely positive. - If you don't, it doesn't work. - I remember. Good. And just like everything else we do around here, it's about to get weirder. - It's good, right? OLIVIA: That was great. - So top that. - Okay. Seriously. That's fantastic. Women never have card tricks. Tell me when to stop. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... - Stop. OLIVIA: Which one? OLIVIA: Four of clubs. - Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve... - Stop. (CLEARS THROAT) Queen of diamonds. (CHUCKLING) - You can count cards. - That's all I would do when I was a kid. If I was a child today, I would be diagnosed with something. I have this thing for numbers. I see them once and remember them. - Seriously? - Yeah. My best friend from high school's license plate: 7240168. My locker combination in middle school: 36, 21, 7. The numbers of the safety-deposit boxes: 233, 377 and 610. - What? - I can do more. Say that again, the numbers on the safety-deposit boxes. - 233, 377 and 610. Why? - I know those numbers. Walter. Hey, Walter. Wake up. Walter, Walter, wake up. This is important. Oh. Oh, oh. Do you two want to use the room? The numbers that you recite. What are they? - Numbers? PETER: Every night, you recite a sequence... ...to help you fall asleep: 233, 377, 610. - 987, 1597. - Precisely those. What is that pattern? It's the Fibonacci sequence. You should know that, Peter. If you had stayed at college... Walter, not everybody knows the Fibonacci sequence. Sure they do. It's a wildly famous mathematical sequence. Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding it. Including 233, 377 and 610... ...which happen to be the numbers of the boxes that were stolen. It's fascinating... ...but it's a coincidence. It can't possibly be significant. Unless... Oh, my God. What? The safety-deposit boxes are mine. WALTER: Cleveland, Baltimore, Philadelphia. Cleveland, Baltimore, Philadelphia. Walter, are there any other deposit boxes... ...that haven't been broken into yet? I don't know. I don't know where because I can't remember... ...why I put things into the boxes. PETER: So let me get this straight. You can remember traveling 23 years ago... ...renting deposit boxes under assumed names... ...but you can't remember why? The why is of secondary importance to what. What was I protecting? Whatever it was, I didn't use my usual hiding places... ...so I suspect it was something of profound significance. Well, excellent. That clears it right up. I was under a great deal of stress at the time. It was before the accident in the lab. Before that poor lab assistant lost her life. I was distrustful of everybody. William Bell, your mother. I was convinced I was being followed. Someone was watching my every move. Which medication is that, Walter? Supplements. Walter, did you tell anybody else? I told you I was paranoid. Okay, get dressed. We're going out. (EXHALES SHARPLY) - Breakfast? CHARLIE: According to your travel records... ...in 1985, you gave a lecture at Syracuse University. Now, these photos are of banks in the Syracuse area. Does any of this trigger anything in your mind? WALTER: Yes, but not about banks. Think back 20 years. Imagine yourself then imagining yourself now... ...twenty years into the future. In your wildest imagination, could you ever think you'd be here? - Is he stoned? - Just show him the other batch... ...and be patient with him. His mind works in a different way. (SCOFFS) BROYLES: Agent Dunham. OLIVIA: What's up? After he split up with his wife, Raul Lugo moved to DC. He was an inpatient at the V.A. there from last May to mid-October. - No visitors. BROYLES: Not according to the records. Don't know what that does... - ...to your theory he was recruited there. - Unless it was by another patient. NINA: You have something? Something remarkable, actually. We tried to access Agent Scott's hippocampus. His brain-wave echo suddenly became erratic. Inconsistent in ways we've never seen. The cause of the inconsistency? We managed to resolve the last image in Agent Scott's optic nerve... ...before he died. This image is linked to a second set of brain-wave echoes: Agent Dunham's. They must have somehow shared consciousness. If that's the case, it would suggest that some of John Scott's memories... - ...perhaps the very ones we need... - Are in Agent Dunham's mind. Hi. Uh, Agent Dunham with DHS. I'm looking for Dr. Bruce Miller. Thank you. Excuse me, Dr. Miller? - Agent Olivia Dunham. I'm with DHS. - What can I do for you, Agent Dunham? I wanted to talk to you about a patient of yours, Raul Lugo. Marine, Force Recon, history of PTSD. I'm sure you know I can't violate patient confidentiality. Raul Lugo is dead, Dr. Miller... ...so his right to confidentiality no longer applies. I'm investigating his death... ...and I need to know about his friends, people that he got close to... If you're referring to patients, those records are also protected. If they're involved in criminal activity... ...it would be your duty to release them to me. - What crimes? - I'm sorry. I'm not authorized to tell you. Suffice to say, the criminals I'm investigating... ...are all highly trained, well-skilled... Agent Dunham, I have two dozen patients to see before I go home. I'm not about to violate my ethical duty based on your say-so. If you'd like to come back with a subpoena, I'd be glad to help. But until then, you'll have to excuse me. (BEEPING) (CLEARS THROAT) He liked to play chess. Raul. He, uh, used to play chess all day long. - With anyone in particular? - There were four of them. - The chess club. - And you remember their names? Get a pencil. LOEB: Let's go. Let's go, let's move, let's go. Door. Let's move. Robert Norton, captain, United States Air Force. Honorably discharged April of '04. Pull up his phone records and financials. - See if anything else ties him to Lugo. - I'm on it. These are the V.A. visitor logs. These men were recruited. Comb the logs and follow up on every entry. I talked to McNeil's wife. Says her husband's away on business. - She hasn't heard from him in two days. - Call his work. We got something. One of our vets bought three one-way tickets... ...to TF Green Airport in Providence. - When do they land? - Forty-seven minutes ago. PETER: Hey, what's up? OLIVIA (ON PHONE): We think the next bank is in Providence. Can you see if it jogs Walter's memory? PETER: Yeah, sure. WALTER: Downstrokes only. Brush with the grain. Hey, Walter, are any of those banks you rented boxes in in Providence? Providence? I don't believe so, no. I'm sorry, Peter. I have tried everything to remember. I understand how important it is, and I'm quite disappointed with myself. Hold on a sec. When she's finished chewing her cud, brush her teeth. I am not brushing a cow's teeth, Walter. You know I have real work to do, right? If you were gonna rent a deposit box in Providence, what bank would you use? In Providence? That would have to be the Fairmont Savings Bank. It's the only one with safe-deposit boxes big enough for my purposes. (COW MOOING) Oh, well done, son. (PHONE BEEPS) PETER: The Fairmont Savings Bank, off Westminster Street. - You're sure? PETER: Oh, yeah. I'm sure. Agent. Sam Martin, Providence SAC. Francis and Dunham. So, what's our status? All surrounding streets are locked down. Per your request, my men are checking all shared walls and alleyways. This is Mr. Grimes. He manages the bank. I don't understand. We've had no alarms or signs of forced entry. - This crew doesn't work like that. - We have cameras, motion detectors... ...sensors that detect fractional variances in ambient temperature. They might be disabling that wirelessly... ...shooting you a feedback loop of old data while they stop and shop. Oh, my God. OLIVIA: Nine-eight-seven. It's the next number in the Fibonacci sequence. These four walls are internal to the bank. I don't care how they got in here, they're still in my perimeter. This layout's not easy. Even if they did get through one of these walls... ...they've got multiple other walls on every side. They wouldn't have time to breach them all. What's underneath? A basement or access tunnels? No, this is the basement. There's 2 feet of solid steel and then the foundation. Everything under that belongs to the city: gas main, sewer, electric. - Sewer. - Providence PD... ...I need the closest sewer-line exit to Fairmont Savings Bank. Let's go. CHARLIE: FBI, freeze! LOEB: Go, go, go! McNEIL: Come on, come on. (TIRES SQUEALING) (BREATHING SHARPLY) McNEIL: Come on, man. Come on, you can do it. Come on. Reach out. You got it. You got it. They're right there. They're on your back. Let's go. (EASTWICK GRUNTS) This is Francis, ID number 31556. I need a BOLO on a black cargo van heading south on Westminster... ...license-plate number 10562-Sierra. I also need EMS. Suspect down. McNEIL: Damn it! LOEB: Shut up. Scrub down and take your shots. I want this box open now. Not until you show me what this is all about. One guy dead, another put away for that? A camera? What the hell is it? LOEB: Word of advice: Don't pry into things you couldn't possibly understand. (CELL PHONE DIALING) We're on. He's coming tonight. JONES: Perfect. Very good. I see you didn't take me up on my offer to go see my tailor. No, I like this suit. It's always been lucky for me. Well, I can appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. Kohl. Come back in the morning with the paperwork for my appeal. Six-thirty sharp. I'll be happy to sign it then. Oh, and wear one of your lucky suits. - Will there be anything else? - As a matter of fact, yes. I'll need my people to procure one last item. And what would that be? Not a what, Mr. Kohl. In this case, a whom. MAN: Target in sight. We have your service record, Mr. Eastwick. Your 1040s. We know everything about you... ...except what it was that you wanted so badly... ...you'd walk through a solid wall. Ryan Shawn Eastwick, staff sergeant, First Special Forces Group... ...Third Battalion, 29-869-617. You're not a POW, Eastwick. You're a criminal. Look at his hands. - They look jittery. CHARLIE: She's wearing him down. No, I don't think so. That looks physiological. Call her out, would you? I got an idea. I wasn't aware you had a background in interrogation. I've been in rooms like that, on both sides of the table. This'll either work, or it won't. Either way, it's only two minutes. We have enough to put you down for armed robbery times three. That's 20 years in federal prison. Do you think the prisoners there will care that you were a hero... ...fighting for your country? (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) You lose him, we lose time. We lose everything. PETER: Look, you're a tough guy, I'm a tough guy. I think we can dispense with the formalities. I'm not gonna stick a thumb in that shot-up leg... ...because A, I think that's exactly what you expect me to do, and B... ...I don't think you'd crack anyway. Now, all I want from you... ...is to show me your hands. Right. Let me see if any of this rings a bell for you. You've been shaking uncontrollably. You vomited twice in the last 10 hours. This morning, you found hair on your pillow. It's starting to fall out. - What's wrong with me? - Radiation poisoning. Right now, you're in the walking-ghost phase. Enjoy. It's better than the intestinal bleeding, delirium... ...and coma phase you're gonna hit in a couple days. You violated the laws of physics, Mr. Eastwick... ...and Mother Nature's a bitch. Are you a doctor? I need to know what you were hired to steal. - He didn't tell us. - Who's he? I need a name. He never told us his name. All right? We were freelance, hired out. He equipped us, trained us. The others' names don't matter. - He's got everything he needs. - Everything he needs to do what? Are you gonna help me or not? Actually, Ryan, no. I'm gonna go on the other side of that glass and watch you bleed out... ...unless you tell me everything I need to know. I swear, I don't know what he's doing. Look, all I know is... I overheard a phone conversation once. He's going to a field in Westford. - What field? - I don't know! Look, you gotta help me, all right? I need some medicine, okay? Some specialists. Please, you gotta help me. Hey! Hey! - There. Westford. CHARLIE: That's 30 square miles. - How are we gonna find one field? OLIVIA: Wait. What? I know where they're going. There's an abandoned airstrip out there. It's called Little Hill Field. Little Hill: That's the code word... ...Joseph Smith gave to Jones in the case a few weeks ago. The guy from the German prison? It can't be a coincidence, Charlie. It's in Westford, just off Route 3. You come in from the west. I'll take south. All right. Listen up! I need every available unit for field assist. Let's move, move, move! It's in here somewhere. What I hid in those banks. Must be. I kept very thorough records. Yeah. Unfortunately, not very organized records. That's quite impressive. It's a nervous tic. Which hand? That's fantastic. (GIGGLES) Magic. What? You nearly died when you were a boy. You started bruising, then your kidneys failed. Doctors didn't know what it was. The closest diagnosis was hepea. It's a rare form of bird flu that hadn't been around for decades. Your mother was beside herself. She stopped eating, she stopped sleeping... ...and I was worse. After all, I was the scientist, and here, my only son was dying... - ...and I couldn't do anything. - I don't remember that. I became consumed with saving you, conquering the disease. In my research, I discovered a doctor. Alfred Gross. Swiss. Brilliant physician. He was the only man that had ever successfully cured a case of hepea. But there was a problem. He had died in 1936... ...and so I designed a device intended to reach back into time... ...to cross the time-space continuum and retrieve Alfred Gross... ...to bring him back with me to fix you, my dying son. The device, Peter. I think that's what I hid in those safe-deposit boxes. And it worked? You were able to go back to 1936 and get this guy? No. Before I could test it, you started to recover. Doctors said it was a miracle. But the science behind it... In theory, it would work. In theory, it could retrieve anyone from anywhere. (GPS BEEPING) GPS: Continue north on Plain A venue... ...for 1.2 miles. (CELL PHONE RINGING) - Dunham. CHARLIE: It's Charlie. I'm headed east on Route 3, about 2 miles out. What's your 20? OLIVIA: I'm 10 minutes out, coming in from the south on Plain. 49.1 .112295 degrees north. 8.916092 degrees east. Horizontal angle: 33.33 grad. We're good to go. MAN 1: What time do you have? MAN 2: Twelve-thirty. (DOOR OPENING) - Mr. Jones. - Mr. Kohl. I have the appeal request all prepared and ready to go. (CLEARS THROAT) All I need is your signature. MAN: This is Bravo team, entering Westford, pulling out onto Bridge Street. OLIVIA: Charlie, a black SUV just came out of nowhere. CHARLIE: Where are you? Give me your 20. Liv? (OLIVIA GRUNTING) MAN: Target captured. (CELL PHONE RINGING) - Hello? BROYLES: Olivia Dunham is missing. What? NINA: What do you mean, "missing"? - It appears she's been abducted. Need I even ask? BROYLES: Are you there? No, yes, yes, I'm here. Frankly, I resent the accusation. I don't make accusations, so let me be clear. - If I find out... - Phillip, that's enough. Now, you know how I feel about Agent Dunham. NINA: Why would I want any harm to come to her? Now, what do we know about who may have taken her and why? So, what does one say at a moment like this? Nice trip? I suppose that works well enough. I need to get into the decompression chamber. - Of course. - Do you have her? Agent Dunham? She didn't even put up a fight. Well, then. Let's not keep her waiting. (ENGLISH SDH)
