 Fringe (2008â€“2013): Season 1, Episode 11 - Bound - full transcript 
 Using her FBI training, Olivia escapes from Robert Jones' people. An FBI agent from Olivia's past is set to investigate the motifs and actions of the Fringe division. Olivia retrieves a sample from her abductors that contains the same parasite that is used to kill an immunologist. At the federal HQ, Loeb interferes with the investigation and finally Olivia figures out he's the other mole. Loeb instructs his wife to kill Olivia but Peter, who overhears the conversation, warns Olivia. Loeb is then caught by the team.

 (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) Walter, what are you doing? I'm dosing a caterpillar. - Dosing. As in LSD? - Well, it's a special blend. - I see. Hey, guess what just happened? - Hmm? My father giving drugs to bugs became a typical moment in my life. It's wonderful, isn't it? Have you heard from Olivia this morning? - No. Why, what's up? - She's missing. (WHEELS SQUEAKING) Who are you?

 What do you want? This won't take long. I'm sure you say that to all the girls. - Turn her over. - Aah! BROYLES: Listen up. One of our own has been abducted. The vehicle of Agent Olivia Dunham was found abandoned... ...on Graniteville Road in Westford three miles northeast of Little Hill. I want everyone doing everything. Cameras checked. Officers and agents questioned. Anyone who might've seen anything. PD, DWP, AAA, I don't care what acronym it is. Get them, talk to them and find Dunham. For those of you new to this office, this is Francis, my second in command. You got anything, you come to me or him. (AIR HISSING)

 (GASPING) Try not to move. Hah! (OLIVIA SCREAMING) - Sir, did it work? - I hope so. Get my car ready. - I'm going back to the office. - Yes, sir. Can I please have some water? If you're going to kill me, then can I please have some water? Please? (WATER POURING) I need to... I need to sit up. Please. (SIGHS) Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (SNIFFS) (GRUNTING) Pull agents from Albany and get them to Boston. Do I need to remind you how I started this? - I have a Sanford Harris, line six. - Just get it done. Sanford? Listen, we are... We're having something of a crisis here. HARRIS: Yeah, your crisis is why I'm calling. Look, Phillip, we go back too far. I say something diplomatic, you'll see through it before the end of my sentence. - You're calling about Olivia Dunham? - I'm calling about Fringe Division. Internal Affairs is sending me in to review your office. Make sure things are running as they should. I just wanted you to hear it from me. (PANTING) MAN: Hey! (CAR UNLOCK BUTTON CHIRPING) (ENGINE STARTS) This is Agent Dunham. I need to speak to Broyles. - What happened to you? OLIVIA: I'm in Watertown. There's a building we need to raid. I need agents, maybe 20. Have them meet me in 30 minutes at Talcott Street. - Are you okay? - Not yet I'm not. (GRUNTING) (SOBS) (VEHICLE APPROACHING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (TIRES SQUEALING, SIRENS WAILING) The building I was being held at... Hands behind your head and drop to the floor. - Where's Broyles? - Do it! What's going on here? Freeze, right there! (GRUNTS THEN GROANS) (PANTING) Quite a day, Agent Dunham. (HARRIS CHUCKLES) You're in Boston Hospital. You probably didn't think you'd see me again so soon. Don't take this the wrong way, Mr. Harris, but... ...I don't think about you all too often. Really? Well, you must get some satisfaction from what you did to me. My conviction wasn't a point of pride for you? Why am I cuffed to the bed? Because this is the kind of authority that I have here. You see, my conviction on sexual assault... ...that you so ably prosecuted, was overturned. And Homeland Security, for whom I consult... ...has assigned me to review Fringe Division. Just like that. Which gives me the prerogative to question your sanity... ...your loyalty, your worthiness to serve. And it seems to me the people you surround yourself with... ...have failed those tests at every turn. Beginning with your former partner... ...uh, heh... ...and lover. John Scott. John! An agent who betrayed you. A guy who turned out to be a traitor against this country. A traitor whose life you went to considerable lengths to save. If you're suggesting I knew... You went to Iraq to recruit a man to help you save Agent Scott's life. - Peter Bishop. Arrested seven times. - I needed Peter. To assist you in freeing his father from a mental institution. Walter Bishop. He was sent to St. Claire's... ...because he was deemed unfit to stand trial for manslaughter. A man who spent most of his adult years... ...running questionable scientific experiments on human subjects. He's out of his mind, Ms. Dunham. These are the people you surround yourself with. A traitor, a criminal, and a lunatic. What does that say about you? Am I under arrest? Hmm. It goes without saying that you are not to investigate your own abduction. Understood? (EXHALES) (PANTING) CHARLIE: Liv. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Liv, you know I had nothing to do with the way you were taken in, right? Yeah. I know that. Harris molested three women, I put him away. That's what this is about. I'm not gonna ask him for a thing. I'm gonna go to that building myself. Yeah, we sent a team to the address, the building where you were being held. It was empty. There was nothing there. What about the phone I got? The car I took? They're clean. The only prints were yours. Oh, there's something else. There's a woman here to see you. Rachel. Says that you're expecting her. Who is she? She's my sister. - Hey. - Hi. - You look great. - I don't really. - Come on, you do. - I don't. - You're always so hard on yourself. - I know. Whatever. Thank you. - You are just a giant person. - Hi, Aunt Olivia. Hello. When did you get so big? - What happened to your face? - Oh, it's... I brought this for you. She wanted to bring you something from her room. I really, really needed one of these. Thank you so much. - Are you sure you're all right? - It's a long story. I... - I'm working on a case, so... - Go, go. We're good. Is it okay if we still stay with you tonight? If it's not... No, of course. I'll meet you back here at 5. - Perfect. Go. Save the world. I love you. - All right. - I'll see you at 5. - Thank you so much. Bye. (CELL PHONE RINGING) - Hello? OLIVIA: Peter, it's me. Olivia. Thank God. Are you okay? How are you? Where are you? I'm on my way to you. Meet me outside in 10 minutes. Bring your father, we need him. Do I have to? They... They gave me a spinal tap. They put electrodes with sensors on my head. Why would they do that? What would they want? What were they doing? Who could they be? You're like a question machine. - There was nothing when they checked? - No. They cleared the building, but I took something before I left. Something from one of their labs, and I hid it to keep it safe. What was it? Can you identify what it is? Yes, I'm afraid I can. MAN: If your high school bio teacher told you that humans sit at the top... ...of the food chain, he or she was dead wrong. Literally millions and millions of organisms feed on us... ...reproduce within us. (SNIFFS) (STUDENTS MURMURING) Viruses, bacteria, protozoa and fungi: The four musketeers of the pathogenic world. (GRUNTING, GASPING) Dr. Kinberg? Dr. Kinberg? Somebody call an ambulance! Somebody help him! (STUDENTS YELLING) MAN 1: Call 911! Get a doctor right away! MAN 2: Somebody help him. KINBERG: Gah! (SOBBING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Fringe s1e11 Bound (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) BROYLES: Dunham, I know you've had quite a day... ...but there's been an event that requires our attention. OLIVIA: Okay. Where? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) WALTER: Internal hemorrhaging, rapid cell deterioration. It appears that he suffocated from within. Maybe that's because a slimy, spiky slug came out of his mouth. Yes. And I have a theory as to what it might have been. I'm sure you do. Care to share? - Eventually. - Peter, anything? No. It always takes a second for the thermal cameras to calibrate. - What do we know about our guy? - What I was told outside. His name's Miles Kinberg. Immunologist. Cutting-edge work. An expert in his field. That's all I know. Well, whatever it was, it ripped through his esophagus on the way out. At least he died teaching. A righteous profession. Hold on a second. (BEEPING) PETER: I got it. - Stay there. - Right there. Right there, right there! - Look. - Simian hemorrhagic fever. PETER: Under the chair. The infected cells have a definitive spiderweb look. Makes HIV look like a common cold by comparison. - Walter. - Ebola. First, the headaches. - Then the skin turns to rice pudding. - Walter, please. No time for the immune response. I lost it. - What do you mean you lost it? - Either it can vanish, or it's fast. (BEEPING RESUMES) PETER: It's really fast. There. OLIVIA: Cover the doors. PETER: It's going down. There. - Get it! - There! There! Get it. Get it, get it, get it. Things like this used to happen in the lab all the time. Makes me nostalgic. (BELL TOLLING) (DOOR OPENS) WALTER: Spirited, isn't it? Well, have you considered, I don't know, killing it? We can always kill it, son. We can't always bring it back. - You probably could. WALTER: That is true. - Do you know what I could go for? ASTRID: Don't say food. - Cheese steak. - Ugh. How can he even think about eating? I know. It's disgusting, right? And yet... - Heh. You want one too. - Extra provolone, please. - Like father, like son. - Come on, don't say that. (CHUCKLES) My theory is correct. I knew it. This organism was developed from the same material... ...that Olivia stole from her captors. - We must let her know. - You're sure? My boy, I'm not even sure that we all exist... ...on the same plane of consciousness. But yes, I believe so. I've been briefed on how you brought in Olivia Dunham. I suspected she might be dangerous. I agreed to let you question her, not tranq her like a rabid dog. What you did was unacceptable. Dunham's been nothing but an exemplary agent and this is my office. Well, then, you need to be corrected on two counts. The jury's out on Dunham. I'm not convinced she's the superstar you claim she is. How could you be? You're on a vendetta. Secondly... ...while I'm here on active investigation, this is under my purview. Active investigation? This morning it was a review. Well, the Pentagon is concerned, Phillip. Well, think of how this office was thrown together. Flight 627 lands, and suddenly you're in charge of two dozen agents? Somehow, I think none of that's the reason you're here. (CHUCKLES) This isn't a witch hunt. I'm not here to punish some JV agent who tried to ruin my life... ...for chasing a little tail. I'm here to do my job. Why don't you do the same? OLIVIA: Did you see anyone unusual in class? - No. - And did he mention anything to you? - Anything in private? - Why would he? - You were his teacher's assistant. - Oh. I thought he might've mentioned if something unusual had happened. No, he didn't. Nothing. We've been trying to track Kinberg's whereabouts over the past week. We spoke to his wife and she said that he had arrived home... ...just before midnight the last two nights... ...but according to his schedule, his last class started at 6:00. He's had extended office hours this week. Well, could I get a list of the students he talked to? It was drop-in. I'm not really sure. I'm sorry. After what happened today... (SCOFFS) ...I feel like nothing's real. That was crazy. How long were you seeing him? Professor Kinberg. Three months. I knew he was gonna take the job... ...and he hadn't even told his wife about it yet. What job was that? I shouldn't... - He wasn't supposed to tell me. - It's okay. The CDC. Centers for Disease Control. They offered him this big job, which meant moving to Atlanta. I figured that was gonna be it for us. - And what exactly was the job? - Task force. To oversee the country's preparedness to fight off an epidemic. It sounded like a big deal. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Can I come in? - I hate that. Knocking and asking while you're coming in. Dr. Kinberg, the professor who died at Boston College... ...was offered a job at the CDC to co-chair a classified task force... ...whose sole responsibility was to respond to epidemics. - And? - He wasn't the only scientist asked. There was another one. Dr. Russell Simon from Cambridge. - I'm trying to locate him now. - You think he's a target too? I do, and I also think that the people who killed Kinberg... ...are the people who took me. - And how'd you make that leap? - Walter. He thinks the thing that killed Dr. Kinberg... ...is similar to evidence that I grabbed from the people who abducted me. Why abduct you? What's the link? Why kill Kinberg like that? I don't know yet, but so far I figured why kill an epidemiologist... ...unless you're looking to start an epidemic? Get rid of the firefighter before you start a fire. Why am I just now hearing of this? Your friend, Sanford Harris, forbade me from investigating my own abduction. Harris. He's put everything on hold... ...has requested that I run all operations past him before we move. - Is that even possible? - Apparently. Sir, I'm asking you to save a man's life. Are you telling me that you don't have the authority to let me do my job? Find Simon. Get him in protective custody now. - Thank you. - I'll handle Harris. I know you will. Hey, Rach, it's me. Can we just meet at the apartment? Is that okay? RACHEL: Yeah, sure. I have the key. Is everything okay? OLIVIA: I'm fine. I won't be too late. If you get hungry there's food in the fridge. Or there are some menus by the phone in the kitchen if you wanna order in. Don't worry about us at all. Ella's having a blast. Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you. You too. Bye. I'm going to Cambridge to pick up Russell Simon. - Who's that? - A man we're taking into custody. - I'll give you the details on the way. - Oh, I'm going with you? - Yeah. - Meet you downstairs. - Hey, Mitch. MAN: Hey. Listen, Olivia, your abduction. I'm gonna coordinate the investigation. I assume everything you remember is already in your debrief. Yeah. If I find anything, I'll let you know. We'll find him. That's great, Mitch. Thank you. OLIVIA: Dr. Simon, thank you for your cooperation. I suppose I should be thanking you. FBI tells you they're here to save your life, you listen. - I know it must seem confusing. - Well, it's certainly shocking. - Miles was a dear friend. - I'm sorry. Know that we're doing everything we can to bring those responsible to justice. The CDC wasn't expecting me for three months. Who else knew you were planning on taking this job? Well, no one. Just my wife. I was instructed not to tell anyone. And is there anyone you can think of who might be targeting you? Maybe students whose grades they might've felt were undeserved. Will you excuse us for a moment? I need to talk to my agents. Sure. Can you give us a minute? So I understand that you have requested placing Dr. Simon in protective custody. I believe that his life may be in danger. Well, that's taxpayer dollars, Ms. Dunham... ...and I haven't approved that. Let me ask you a question. I enjoy having you here, but how long are you planning on sticking around? Until I have made a full assessment of how this office conducts its business. Did Broyles approve your request? No, he did not. Mr. Harris, you don't like me, you don't respect me... ...and you think I'm bad at my job. But don't let that get in the way of doing the right thing. That man in there may likely die if we don't keep him safe. I'm not asking you to like me. I'm asking you to do the right thing. Yeah, we'll keep him safe. Thank you. (CELL PHONE RINGING) - This is Dunham. PETER: Walter's trying to determine... ...what that thing is, but I think we made a breakthrough. - Okay. So, what is it? - It seems to be activated by a liquid. OLIVIA: What does? The parasite? The yellow powdery stuff in the vials? They're like eggs. But the catalyst is stomach acid. OLIVIA: So the victim just needs to ingest it. PETER: Exactly right. And then it grows. Fast. - Thank you. LOEB: No problem. Is there any way to trace where it came from? Walter doesn't think so, no. Dr. Simon. With your permission, we'd like to take you to our field office. We'll debrief you, go over your options. Then we'll move you to a safe house. - You okay? - Yeah. There'll be agents there on call, 24 hours a day... (GRUNTING) This is Agent Francis. I need medical attention, Room 6. I called medical assistance... (GROANING) (MOUTHS) Oh, my God. It's viral. Nasopharyngitis, albeit a gargantuan specimen. What does that mean? This organism is a single specimen of a virus of a common cold. So you're saying this is one single cell? It's not unprecedented. The ostrich egg is a single cell and it can grow up to five pounds. They supersized the common cold, which is disgusting. - Obviously somebody is playing with us. PETER: They're showing off. - Killing epidemiologists with a cold. - It is impressive. I wanna know what they wanted from you. Oh, who cares about me? I wanna know who's next. I care about you. If we can figure out why they need you... ...then maybe we can figure out who's next. I'm gonna keep looking... ...for someone who's connected to Kinberg and Simon. She is beautiful, isn't she? - Who? - The slug. (SIZZLING) - You know, I could have cooked for you. - Oh, no thanks, I've tasted your cooking. Hey, I've gotten really good, you know. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - No, I haven't. - I didn't think so. - Hard day? - Heh. I honestly wouldn't know what to tell you. And if I did, it would be a felony. - You have a crazy job. - Yeah, I have a crazy job. - Cheers. - Cheers. Have you heard from Greg? (SIGHS) I don't know how to do this alone. Ella is beautiful and smart and strong, and she gets that from you. Me? No, you've always been the strong one, you have. Rach... I've only done one thing right in my life. Then you need to be strong for her. Whatever you need, I'm here. And you guys can stay here as long as you want. Thank you. Is there something else? Something you're not telling me? No. No, there's nothing else. - How goes it? - Horrible. We'll find him, whoever's responsible for what happened. Maybe this'll help. I need to talk to you. Charlie, I think I know who killed Simon... ...and I think it's the same person who abducted me. Who? Mitchell Loeb. Don't ask me how I know, I'll tell you later. - Livvy, that can't be right. - It is. And I can prove it. But I've got Harris watching me like a prison guard. I can't do this myself. What do you need? (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (RINGS DOORBELL) (KNOCKING) (DOG BARKING) PETER: Walter, is that LSD? - LSD? Why would I...? It's a decongestant. She is a giant cold virus, after all. (DOOR OPENS) Right. Peter. You got a moment? What's up? Olivia may have a lead on who abducted her. Only she can't pursue it without some help. - I can't help her. - Why not? Suffice it to say that sometimes the problem with being in law enforcement... ...is that you gotta obey the law yourself. You think I'm the guy to break the law. - I'm sorry, I didn't... - No, you're right. I am the guy to break the law for you. What do we need? I need a wiretap. - On who? - Mitchell Loeb, FBI. WOMAN Hello? - Samantha. - Olivia, hi. I was just in Marlborough. I thought I'd drop by, just to see if you're okay. I don't understand. I don't know, I guess I hadn't talked to you since Mitchell's surgery. Oh. Well, how sweet of you. Would you like to come inside? Have a cup of tea? Yeah, thank you. OLIVIA: I've been thinking a lot about you... ...and everything that you and Mitchell went through. It's lovely having him back at the office. Oh, yes, he's really glad to be back. His recovery seemed to go smoothly. What were you doing in Marlborough? I'm working on a case. Well, what's the case? Suspicion of a double agent. (TEA KETTLE WHISTLING) Excuse me. I'll get the tea. Mind if I use your bathroom? - It's down the hall. - Thank you. Kyle. Hey, man... Can you grab me that phone? All right, go ahead. Uh-huh. Okay, so I enter the phone number and then just punch in that code. Kyle, you are the greatest, man. Have I told you that lately? Yeah, thanks, you too. He used to work at the phone company, I never understood why. - The guy's a genius. - You're right. You don't wanna waste any of that potential. (CHUCKLES) He tapped into the Loebs' home phone. We should be able to pick up any outgoing calls they make. (RINGING) This is Mitchell. - Olivia Dunham is in our house. - Why? She claims she was here to check on you. Is it working? No. Kyle, it's not working. All I'm getting is buzz. I don't hear anything. - I think she knows. - I don't know how she could. - I don't know what to do. - Well, I do. And you have to move fast. You need to kill her. Right now. Her office might know that she's here. How can I just... Dunham's already under suspicion for being unstable. They think she's dangerous. All right, I'll try it again. (DIALING) Whew. (STATIC OVER PHONE) LOEB: We can say she came after you, that it was self-defense. - There has to be another way to do this. - There isn't, honey. There's one way. You cannot let Dunham leave there alive. In the entry closet, top shelf, in the back, there's a gun. Contact me when it's done. - What is it? - Olivia's in trouble. - What happened? - Hold on. (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Come on, pick up, pick up, pick up. It's me. PETER: Get out of the house, she's gonna kill you. - What? - Samantha Loeb is going to kill you. Get out of the house right now. (CAR UNLOCK BUTTON CHIRPS) Olivia. (WATER RUNNING) Tea's ready. Olivia. Samantha. Turn around and put the gun on the ground. Put the gun down. (GUN CLATTERS) Now get down on the ground. Samantha. (CRYING) Please. Don't hurt me. Get on the ground. - I was doing what my husband asked. - Samantha, get down on the ground. - I don't wanna shoot you, but I will. - Are you gonna hurt me? Damn it, Samantha, shut up and get down on the ground. Please, get down... (GRUNTING) (PANTING) There's nothing here. Loeb knew he was gonna cut and run. - You have nothing to trace. - No, nothing yet. I'll need more time to trace the origin of the virus. But even then, it would be impossible to know the exact origin. Liv, I hate to even ask you this. Anything you remember from when they had you? No. There's nothing that I heard, nothing that I remember. There's no other way to track Loeb's cell? - Tech services tried everything. - Wait, not everything. The agents are surveilling the area, right? No sign of Loeb? - Not yet. - So he doesn't know about his wife. - No, he doesn't. - Meaning she could still contact him. - I'm ahead of you. I'll get a team. - What happened? I missed it. Okay, we need Samantha's cell phone. Inventory has it. CHARLIE: I'm on it. - Nice work. Thanks. It's all rather tense, isn't it? He's gonna come. Assuming, of course, they text each other. - Do you see him yet? - No, not yet. Peter was worried about you when you were gone. - Walter... WALTER: You were. - Well, of course I was worried. - He was really worried. We got him. Stay here. (TIRES SCREECHING) Mitchell. Put it down, put it down. Freeze. LOEB: Aah! Drop it. Drop your weapon. You're under arrest. (GRUNTS) Nice work. Thank you. OLIVIA: Who are you working for? Don't be an idiot, Loeb. This is your one chance to cooperate. I'd say to you that you have no idea how hard we're gonna come down on you... ...except you do. I wanna see my wife. You're not getting a thing until you talk. Then you're out of luck. Why'd you kill them? Kinberg and Simon? And why like that? I mean, there are easier ways to take somebody out. You're getting nothing. She can't do it. She won't get a confession. I'd say the evidence in his house is plenty. I'd say evidence is no confession. LOEB: Ask as many questions as you want. Why take me? And that spinal tap, what did you want? Look, this is your last chance to cooperate. Or what? You'll torture me? Can you leave me alone with him? What's she doing? You want your wife, Mitch? Yeah, Olivia, I do. Okay. Okay. And do you wanna know who pulled the trigger? (CRYING) Mitch. You're looking at her. Did you kill them? - Did you...? - Yes! Do you not understand the rules? What we're up against? Who the two sides are? Tell me at least you know that. - Who's we? - We had a plan here, lady. We had a shot. - And you just blew it. - Why did you kidnap me? Kidnap you. Idiot. - We saved you. - Saved me from what? We were going to let you go. We saved you. You have no idea what you've done. Not a clue. (CRYING) There's your confession. You need to get some rest. - I think you've earned it. - I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you. He's right. You should get home. What did he mean he saved me? What the hell was that? - He was messing with you. - I don't know. Did you see him? There was something about the way he said that... The man's insane, Olivia. I concur, and in the category of "It takes one to know one." - That man did seem disturbed. - Then why take me? They wanted to hurt you. They knew you were investigating them. - They wanted to take you out. - Then why not just kill me? You're talking about a man who infects people with giant viruses. If you hadn't escaped, who knows what they would have done? Listen to me. You just told him that you killed his wife. He said that to you to try and get a reaction out of you, to get to you. Let it go. You got his confession. Go home. I was worried too, when you were taken. Thank you, Walter. Not as much as him, of course. PETER: Walter... WALTER: It's true.
