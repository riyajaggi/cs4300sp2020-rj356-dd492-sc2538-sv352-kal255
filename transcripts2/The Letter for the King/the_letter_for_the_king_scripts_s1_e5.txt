 Hey! Wait for me! Come on! Guys, wait! What about this letter he was supposed to deliver? Who cares about the letter? Seems like everyone cares about the letter. How can you still be discussing this? You saw what he did in that cave. I have no idea what he did in that cave. It doesn't matter what he did. We have him now, and our job is to take him home.

 So you can hand him over. He's riding with me now. What, on that mule? It's barely big enough for you. For your information, this is not a mule. It is a pony or quite possibly a very small breed of horse. And given the size of his legs, moves amazingly fast and is amazingly strong. So don't be casting aspersions. Now, back off. He's coming with us. What's wrong with you? Unless you're blind or stupid, you know there's something special about him. The most powerful and dangerous people in the world, not to mention every freak we come across, are all trying desperately to get their hands on him.

 Why do you think that is? Because he killed the Black Knight. You seriously believe Tiuri killed the Black Knight? It doesn't matter what we believe or whether or not he did it. - I'm not sure... - He broke the vigil. He destroyed our futures. The only way we can get them back - is by taking him home. - Exactly. I thought people in Mistrinaut were ruthless scum. But you aristocrats, you take the biscuit. And don't you forget it. And in case you're thinking about any funny business, remember, we've got her, and she's the most ruthless scum of us all. I meant that in a good way. Well, he's not gonna be worth anything if he's dead, is he? - I thought we were getting help. - So did I. Where is she taking us then? I'm not taking you anywhere. Ardanwen is. Well, where's Ardanwen taking us? Looks like we're about to find out. What on Earth happened here? It's a ghost town. Do you think it's haunted? Is this place giving you the creeps as much as this place is giving me the creeps? Creep City. Creepitude County. - Kingdom of... - Shut up, Piak. Cursed King Creep. Help me. - What is it? - Shh. We need help. For our friend. He's hurt. Please. Perfect! A hamlet of half-wits. We in hurry. We... need help. We have pretty beads. Say thank you. What? It's how you talk to these people. Who sent you here? No one. Our friend is sick. He's your friend, not ours. Some food for him and a place for the night, and then we'll be on our way. One night. He's our prisoner. We carry him. - He's not a prisoner. - Yes, he is. He's been a prisoner since we found him. We took Tiuri prisoner? No, we didn't take anyone prisoner. Yes, we did. My first prisoner. I wouldn't if I were you. He'll take you head off. Sir, perhaps we... I'm busy. - But... - No. Your Majesty. Prince Viridian is momentarily detained with military matters. With your permission... Ah, military matters indeed. If you're about to berate me for my lack of manners, you can save your breath. Hmm. That cloud looks like a chariot... pulled by a fish. I want to be here about as much as you want me to be here. So why don't we get this over with as quickly as possible? Then we can both see the back of this wretched meeting. All we can do now is wait. Didn't your mother ever tell you not to do that? Cloth. You have nice hands, though, good skin, fine eyes. Your hair would make a haystack blush, of course, but you'd scrub up well. Maybe I have no interest in scrubbing up well. Fair enough. But just so you know, it would help take the stink away. Now... you and I need to have a conversation. Where does a child like you get a horse like that? It's not mine. It's Tiuri's. You're lying. Tell me the truth. I'm not lying. A famous knight told him to take it. Said to take his horse and deliver a letter to the king. What knight? Answer me! Open the door. You can kill me, child... or you can tell me the truth, but those are the only two ways you're getting out of this room. The Black Knight with the White Shield. And why did the Black Knight need a boy to take this letter? Because he was dying. What Lavinia said should simply be given some consideration. That's all I'm saying. And what you're saying is stupid because what Lavinia said is complete nonsense. How is it nonsense? You seriously believe that Tiuri's the hero of some ancient prophecy? That the Black Knight gave him a secret letter in an Eviellan puzzle box, and that if he doesn't deliver it to the king, the whole world will be swallowed by infernal darkness? Well, does that sound like nonsense to you or what? That... actually does sound quite like nonsense. Finally. So are we agreed, once and for all? Hello? Hello? Take this letter. Take this letter. You must deliver it to King Favian in Unauwen. It's a very special ring. I don't understand. I think you do. Why do you think Ardanwen brought you here? He was coming home. The Black Knight lived here? Are you... I'm so sorry. Were you with my... husband... at the end? Near the end. He was wounded... and outnumbered... but he drew his sword and turned to fight them. Story of his stupid life. No. He was magnificent. A true knight. And so it goes, handed down from one blinkered knight to the next. You think I want this? If you have any sense, you'll forget my husband and ride straight back to where you came from. I can't do that. You can, and you must. You don't understand. Everything that's happened, these things I've never been able to understand, is sending me on the same journey your husband was sending me on. You think something is guiding you? Huh? Fate, is that it? Destiny. That's what my husband thought. It's what all knights think as they ride off to glory, convinced that they're gonna put the world to rights at last. And where does it always end? In death... and slaughter... and the people you care about never coming home. You think just because you're here, you're a hero? You're a fool, Tiuri. Take it from me. The last thing this world needs is another hero. Sometimes, my friends... life... is so impossibly sweet. And this time, we're really going to milk it. You took a vote? We did. And Tiuri's coming with us. His fever's broken, and his color's returning. And that means that tomorrow morning, Tiuri will be riding to Unauwen with me. Uh, no, he's not. And what would be the point anyway? You said it yourself, you don't have the stupid letter. The Red Riders have it. So even if we let you take him, which we won't... you wouldn't be delivering anything. Tiuri? You all right? Arman's right, though. The Red Riders do have the letter. But unfortunately for them... they don't have all of it. But this makes no sense. It's just a time and a date. "Vespers hour, on the feast of Saint Adalar, in the 36th year of the reign of Favian the Third." That's it? That's all there is? - Why is that so important? - It isn't important. It's important to Viridian. That's what matters. The Red Riders are his bodyguards. They killed the Black Knight and tried to kill me to get this letter. Give it to me. Do you smell that? I knew it. It's vinegar. It's an old smuggler's trick. "The date is set, the hour has come." "The throne will now be mine." "The following will pay the price at my ascension." Are those our parents' names? - Are they gonna kill our parents? - No, no one's gonna kill our parents. The letter didn't say anything about killing anyone. It's just a date and a list of names. Written in invisible ink by a man who's about to seize the crown and kill anyone who might get in his way. They're gonna kill our parents. Where's he going? To do what I was always going to do: finish what the Black Knight started and deliver this letter to the king. When he sees what Viridian's doing, he'll stop him. And how does that work exactly? How do you get a letter to the king? You think just anyone can waltz in and see the most powerful man in the world? You have to be somebody to even see the man who tips out the king's chamber pot, and you're not somebody, Tiuri! You're not even nobody. You're a nobody accused of murder. You think you'll just walk in to the strongest place in the whole of the north, past Favian's entire army and all the way to the king himself with just her to help you? Never going to happen. You're going to use your powers. But to use them, I've got to learn to control them. Well, how are you going to do that? No! I'm not doing this. If you kill me, I will kill you. Go. Do you even know how to summon these powers? Not exactly. How are you gonna make him explode then? No one's making anyone explode. Reach down inside and draw on Eviellan in you. - Close your eyes... - Stare at him really hard. What you wanna do is be moving your hands like this. Whoo... Ha! That's actually quite good. Create with your mind, and it will become your reality. Picture Arman... flying through the air. - I like that picture. - Can everyone shut up for a moment? Please don't let it hurt. Please don't let it hurt. Please don't let it hurt. Hey! That wasn't magic! Sorry, couldn't resist. You're dead! Someone tell that brat he's graveyard dead! Can we please all concentrate? Move! Fly away! Be gone! Go on then, Tiuri... come and get me, huh? Come and save the world. Come on! Come and get me! Whoo! Everyone, look, Tiuri the hero. Come on, Tiuri. Come on. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Come on, Tiuri. Come on. Come on. I've got more magic in my smallest farts than he does in his entire body. Come on. Whoo! Whoo! Come on. Come on. Need a drink. A drink, you fool, not water. There he goes. Dead man walking. Any luck? I take that as a no. Maybe it can't be controlled. Maybe it just decides for itself when it happens. Tiuri, stop. This thing, whatever it is, is in you. It is you. So take control. The times it's worked before, the cave, the monastery... what do they have in common? - I was being attacked. - Exactly. So maybe it comes when... your heart's pounding, and your emotions are running high, and you're not thinking. You're just there in the moment. Right. Go on then. Attack me. That's never going to work. You know I won't hurt you. What? What is it? Why do you all care about Tiuri so much? What's he ever done for any of you? You know why. Our parents' names are on that letter. Is this really the Black Knight's house? We can't sit by and do nothing while Viridian has them all killed. We talked about this. The letter doesn't even mention killing. Easy for you to say. Your parents' names aren't on the list! What's that supposed to mean? The Black Knight wrote with this quill? He may well have done. It's not supposed to mean anything. It's a fact! Her parents aren't on the list either. Why aren't you looking at her? Her parents are dead... you idiot. Well, fine, whatever. The point is you think my father's involved in this, don't you? You think my father wants your parents dead? You're out of your minds! My father doesn't need to kill anyone! My father's so clever, he can run rings around his enemies without ever having to draw his sword. The Black Knight ate off this plate? The Black Knight shaved with this brush? The Black Knight clipped his nose hair with... Are you seeing what I'm seeing? By all the holy saints! Ugh! It's pounding. You did it. Told you. You're telling me... that you've not only lost one of my letters... but that the boy who found it... the boy who has it now... is the Shaman's son? Get out. - My Lord, if you'd just let me ex... - Out! The same boy. - Can you be invisible? - No. - Can you fly like a bird? - Piak, shut up. Did you kiss her, or did she kiss you? I still haven't heard an answer yet. Ow. What are you, Tiuri? In for a difficult conversation, by the looks of it. Most prophecies... they're just old wives' tales. But there are some that aren't like that. Some have been told for generations in every kingdom, in every language. The prophecy your friends spoke of... is one of them. "First came the Earth... and all we desire. Then came the beast... the dark spreading like fire. Cloaking the land on the reddest of moons... only once every century does the sky make it bloom. The great mage of the North... will bring light to the shadow... while the amaranth flowers... and the fields lie fallow." The date on the letter... it's the same date that the Blood Moon rises. Then this hero, whoever he is, had better get a move on, hadn't he? Thank you... ...for not killing me. You're home now. You can rest. This is my journey now. Hey! Hey! It's Fantumar. We have to go. Come on! How'd he find us? - How could you? - I didn't do anything. - He told his father. He must've. - Stop. He wanted you dead. He wanted to serve you up on a plate and our parents with it. - I didn't. - We don't know what he did. Not for sure. Not yet. Right now, all that matters is getting our horses and getting out of here. So, come on. Find him! Search everywhere! Let's go. Wait. Where's Iona? Told you I was the one you needed to worry about. You idiots sent me on a merry dance. But now, you're going to pay for it. Drop your weapons and hand over that Eviellan scum. Don't make me tell you again! And you... get your useless ass over here right now. You'll live to regret this, boy. Get them! Get back! Get the horses! Don't let them go! Someone get the horses! Get the Novices! They're getting away! Some things never change. Ardanwen! Stop that horse! He's getting away! Do you think I was born yesterday? Hand that Eviellan traitor over... or this day is going to end very badly for you. Oh, it's also going to end very badly for someone else too. You call yourself a knight. I will not allow this. You will have to go through me first. That's actually my preferred route. Get off your horses now. Do something. Use your powers. Powers? What powers has this shrimp got? Uh, you might want to... No! Maybe this is a sign, my lord. Maybe this is a warning... that what you are trying to do... the darkness you are trying so hard to banish... ...is in danger of consuming you. Maybe that's what the prophecy's telling us. That if you continue on this path... you will become the darkness. And this boy will become the hero who has to destroy you. You know nothing, Jabroot. For there to be shadow... there first has to be light. The hero the prophecy speaks of... isn't this meaningless boy. It is me. It has always been me. The darkness is already out there in the wars and divisions that will always pit one man against the other. And it is the darkness that throws this boy against me now. For when the Blood Moon reaches its highest point, and I'm bathed in its light at last... this boy... and the darkness he serves... will find they have met their match. That was the most incredible thing I've ever seen. You did it, Tiuri. You did it. No, I didn't do it. What do you mean, you didn't do it? If you didn't do it, then who did?
