 It was never Tiuri. He thought it was him because he was hearing these voices. Because he was like, "I'm the son of a Shaman, because my father's power flows through my veins." Piak. Except it was nothing to do with that. It was the magic that's everywhere. Just like in Foldo's ghost story. And what it was actually doing was sending him to find the girl sitting on the horse right next to him. What's up with her?

 Tiuri? Tiuri, we've... We've got... What's up with him? Lavinia! Lavinia! Leave me alone. The Blood Moon rises in one day. And we have to get that letter to the king before it does. You're the only one who can do it. How do you know that? 'Cause I was standing right next to you. I felt it, Lavinia. And I never felt anything like it. I don't care. I don't care about the king...

 or your mission... or your stupid knightly quest. I live in Mistrinaut, Tiuri, and no king, or queen, or anyone else has ever given a flying fig about the people who live there. So forget your stupid prophecy... and these stupid powers. It's not who I am, and it's not who I'm going to be. I thought we were friends. I thought whatever happened... whatever we faced... we'd face it together. Well, then you thought wrong. Isn't that a splendid sight? Hardly. He's marched his army to the very walls of the city. The threat he poses is clear. Oh, not for me. You're making this match for him with Alianor because you know he's a threat. And I'm telling you, a marriage to Alianor will not be enough. I am making this match for him because he's my son. And because he's your brother. Do you remember your boots? - Boots? - Mmm. When you were both boys, I would take you off hunting, and he would hide your boots. - Viridian? - Mm-hmm. Would hide my boots? Couldn't have been more than six years old. But he thought if you didn't have your boots, you couldn't come, and you would stay with him. That boy loved you more than life itself. Listen, boy, I'm no fool. Bring we proof his intentions are treacherous... and I will act. But until then... we will not speak of this again. The boy took down all your men with one look? Not sure what it was, my lord. There was a sound... a ringing. And then... And then what? We must've been thrown from our horses. Leave us. Sire, I did everything... Leave... us. He's growing stronger. So is the moon. I can feel it in my bones. Once it reaches the highest window in the hall, I can make the final sacrifice, and the ceremony will be complete. Then nothing will be able to stop me... including this boy... whatever powers he may possess. Spit it out, then. I need a job, and you're gonna give it to me. This will be interesting. Fantumar's played out. We both know that. And there's something else you know too: how much help I can give you. Clearly, there's been a misunderstanding. I don't need anyone's help. Who is it Viridian's always asking for, huh? You... his faithful Red Rider... or Jabroot, his Eviellan friend? Seems to me, you need all the help you can get. What are you looking at? I'm not the one you need. I've never been the one you've needed. Your master picked the wrong person. Come. Join us, my boy. We bid you welcome... to the land of the lost. Fear no more, for there's no further you can fall. So abandon hope. Drink and be merry. Come on, boy. Come and sit with us. You look as though you could do with a friend. Tiuri! Tiuri! Tiuri! We're just going round in circles. - We'll never find him. - We have to find him. Tiuri has the letter. - How are we going to find him in this? - It doesn't matter how. Just keep looking. Tiuri! Tiuri! Life's a game, boy... and it's stacked against men like us. Take you, boy. You did the right thing. You opened that door. You helped that stranger. And what did life give you in return? It destroyed you. Bit by miserable bit. So what's a man to do? Aye, well, that's the question. A man gives up, Tiuri. He stops trying. And he gives himself over to the peace and surrender... ...of the bottle. Tiuri? Flesh of dog! What is this? You scared? Only when I think about it. Great advantage of being me is I don't really think about it. ♪ Young knights Their swords were gleaming ♪ For me, that's... that's the scariest part. There's things happening my parents don't even know about, things that could take their lives... and the only ones that can stop them... are us. I don't think I can. Are you kidding? You're kind. You're brave. You're amazing with that sword. Your parents are lucky to have their lives depending on you. Just think about my parents. All they got is me and pipsqueak. Pipsqueak's actually quite good. Shut up. So... if we all die tomorrow... Which we probably will. ...what's one thing that you haven't done... that you'd, um... you'd really like to have done? Honestly? Honestly. ♪ His looks were so alluring ♪ ♪ Young Foldo's heart was... purring ♪ Purring? Is that the best you can come up with? It's a first draft. Revisions to follow. ♪ And the love between them lasted ♪ ♪ Till the grave ♪ I don't blame you for turning your back on me. I'd turn my back on myself for how wrong I've been. Wrong about this quest, wrong about my father, wrong about everything. But most of all... I've been wrong about you. I thought you were a fool, Tiuri. I thought everything you said and everything you did was just so... stupid. But it turns out you weren't the stupid one. I was. And it's taken me my entire life to finally see it. And that's why I know we have to go. Why? What's the point? Because people are going to die, Tiuri. Jussipo's parents, Foldo's parents are going to die unless we stop it. - Can't stop anything. - That's not true. You can... by delivering that letter to the king. Even if I could, why would I try? My father's already dead. He died from the blade of your father's sword. Held by your father's men. Helpless. Unarmed. And I had to watch it. Then he imprisoned my mother and sent you to hunt me down. Probably to kill me too. So you don't get to tell me what I should or shouldn't do, Arman. Go to Lavinia. She's the only one that can help you now. Lavinia? Why would I go to Lavinia? What's Lavinia got to do with this mission? You tell me that. Look, I know I have no right to tell you anything, and what my father did to you... what I was willing to help him do to you, I will never forgive myself for that. But Lavinia? So what if she's the one with the powers? Was she the one who answered the knock on that chapel door? No, that was you. Was she the one the Black Knight gave the letter to? No, that was you, Tiuri. Not because you were magic. Because you were the only one brave enough to answer the call. Because you're a knight. Just like we're knights. Even me. And now, we're going to prove it. What? What? What? Nothing. What are you doing here? Getting him. This will never work. It will work. Look at this place. And Tiuri doesn't even have any magic. Stop talking about magic. All anyone talks about is magic, and I'm sick of it. Forget magic. We're knights. We have courage. We have training. We have chivalry, and honor, and 1,000 years of history on our side. And this is where we use it... to find a way through those walls. Right, Tiuri? Tiuri? Who said anything about going through them? - Stop pushing. - I'm not pushing. - He's definitely pushing. - Then move faster. It stinks down here. It stinks worse than Arman. Shut up! Now what? Are we going around in circles? Round and round like moths at a candle. We could die down here, and no one would ever know. No one's going to die, are they, Tiuri? Tiuri? Tiuri! Come on. This way. Are you sure you know where you're going? We get out where the water gets in, the highest point. Quick question: Are you sure this is water? I would like you to ride with me tonight, Jabroot. We began this journey together, and I would like us to end it together. Go ahead. Strike. You have served me loyally for as long as I can remember... and hated me for every second of it. You have my blessing. Go ahead. Do what you must do. I know. Brothers can kill each other... but not brothers at arms. The end is coming... but it won't be from this. You're pushing me again. Because you're going even slower than you were before! It's... It's in my hair! It's in my hair! It's definitely not water. See? I told you. Easy. My boy. Father. You're home. After all these years. Bravo. Oh, stop it! What are you staring at? Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Come. Sit with me. Get stuffed to the gills. We've roast so many animals, there's been a run on gravy. Brother. Here. Eat. Eat. You're skinny. This boar was killed by your brother yesterday. It's around this corner. Come on. Where do you think you're going? Surprise. You have every right to hate me. Well, we do hate you. I hate me too. What I did... what I've done... I'm sorry... for all of it. I'm sorrier than you'll ever know. But I just... I just wanted you to know that. Iona? Every time you think you've got her pegged... she turns around... and she surprises you all over again. Looks like the letter's not going to the king after all. Now... do you want to walk away and live or make a futile gesture of defiance... and die? A futile gesture, it is. Stay there. - Piak! - I've got it! What did I tell you? Tiuri! - What are you waiting for? - Go! Go! No! Jussipo! I have a letter... for the king. What? What letter? Who cares what letter? Does the royal court now allow mere children to enter the presence of the king? My father died for this. The Black Knight with the White Shield died too. The Black Knight? I have his ring as proof. He was slaughtered by Prince Viridian's Red Riders. I saw it with my own eyes. Who is this boy? He... is nobody. I am Tiuri... son of Sir Tiuri the Valiant. Born of Eviellan, raised in Dagonaut. And we are all in danger if you do not read this letter. Let him through. What is this? Treachery? You take my crown? Kill my friends and allies? Answer me! You dare ignore your king? Bow your head to your father! I will not tell you again. Bow your head. Beg for your king's mercy. If the world is to be healed... then the power he has... the power you want to be yours... has to be mine. The decisions you take... the decisions the people on that list take... will now be taken by me. What is this? Lives you've all led... lives of comfort and luxury... lives built on the bodies of soldiers like me and my enemies... are now over. And yes, freedom is over too. And the world will have peace at last. A peace... that will last forever. He's mad. It has been foretold. And there's nothing any of us can do to stop it. Even you. Brother... ...I beg to differ. It is done. Our journey together can now begin. I'm scared. I know. No. Stop! Stop! You did it. Are you okay? Never been better. Don't worry. I've got you. Would now be a good time to get that reward? Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Did we do it? Did we stop him? How could we not stop him? Has he messed up my hair with all his... all his fussing? Your hair looks good. Better than good. It looks great. I've always had great hair. Ain't that right, Fol? He will be all right. Won't he? ♪ Young Knights Their swords were gleaming ♪ ♪ Lady admirers beaming ♪ ♪ And the one they call Jussipo Was their king ♪ Well... we certainly made a fine mess of that. I like you, girl. Honestly, I do. But I swear by the gold in my first victim's teeth... I hope never to cross paths with you again. You didn't hear what I just said? I never listen to what you say. That's what makes us such a good team. Where are you going? I'm heading west! Ah, suit yourself! You're harder to live with than saddle rash! The darkness from which we are only now emerging did not gather overnight, and it was not caused by one man alone. It was caused by all of us. But these young Novices have led us into the light... by their simple commitment not to give up, not to stop trying to do the right thing no matter what the cost. No matter how slim the chances of success, they have reminded us what those values truly are. And so... on behalf of us all... it is in the highest honor that I knight them in your name. Arise, Sir Foldo. Arise, Sir Arman. Arise, Sir Piak, the youngest knight in Dagonaut's history. And finally... arise... Sir Tiuri the Valiant.
