 Stop. Stop! Stop! Tell me... the moment Jabroot returns. Yes, my lord. - How did you do that, Tiuri? - I don't know. How can you not know? When we lost the Red Riders outside Mistrinaut in that fog... was that you too? I don't know. The monks in that cell, I know that was you.

 Not just because I saw it, but I felt it. I felt the power of it. But how? Do you want me to keep saying that I don't know? Because I can just keep saying that I don't know. The Abbot said it came from inside. Is it Eviellan? Is that what it is? You really don't know anything, do you? Is this it? Is this where you head north? You're determined to deliver that letter, aren't you? I suppose King Favian will be pleased to get it. So pleased he'd give you a reward? Is that all you think about? Answer the question.

 You stole my horse, you gave me to your father, all so you could find your road. Now you're gonna forget it? The road's not going anywhere, is it? That is. You and me, Tiuri. I can feel it already. We're gonna be unstoppable. Truly, you are just... Convincing? Persuasive? Incontrovertibly correct? Shameless. I'll take that as a yes. I'm sorry. This just doesn't feel right. Maybe these people don't deserve horses. Maybe they're a gang of ruthless outlaws. Have you thought of that? We can't just steal them. We're supposed to be knights. Not until we bring back Tiuri, we're not. Ristridin told us to help him. And my father told us he was a traitor. Yeah, but you said your father was a liar. I did not. You did, actually. You said that he was a liar. I said when he lies, he's very good at it. That's completely different from saying he's a liar. Actually... - Yeah, to be honest. - It's not that... - No, I said... - It doesn't matter. Don't you get it? Ristridin, Fantumar, all the others, they don't care about us. If we've got Tiuri, then we've got something to bargain with. We can't get Tiuri without horses. Alianor? Alianor, please wait. Mount up! Mount up! Follow the queen. She's unprotected. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah. Hyah. Alianor? Careful, sire. Your brother may be disappointed if the goods arrive shop-soiled. Taking risks with your safety is no laughing matter, Your Highness. Seems the only risk to my safety is you. These woods have been known to harbor unsavory characters. Well, I've hunted in these woods all my life... and the most unsavory character I've ever come across is your father. I do want you to know that I will be protesting to the king in the strongest possible terms. His manner was blunt and disrespectful, and his plan... Please... don't. I'm not angry at your father's manner or your father's plan. I'm angry that I didn't think of it first. - Madam, what are you doing? - Don't be such a prude. We are pawns, you and I, to be sacrificed in some political chess game. It's my turn now. It will be yours soon enough. - Madam... - So my advice... is that we make hay while the sun shines. Madam, I cannot be a party to this. Join me. Swimming was never one of my strengths. If you get in trouble... I'll save you. Besides, you're full of too much hot air to drown. Did you get your hair wet? I did. So the Shaman's wife had a child... and that child is now missing? Yes, my lord. You will find them, Jabroot. And you will return them to their graves. Are you sure, my lord? The war is done. Maybe now, the slaughter can be done too. Every battle I've fought... every life I've taken... it's all been in the name of peace. And yet, the world suffers still. But when the blood moon rises... all suffering will end... for you, me, for everyone. Send out hunting parties. Scour the countryside and find me the Shaman's wife and son. Nothing must be allowed to get in our way. We're in luck. They said this boat is going all the way to Berlan. From there, it's a two-day ride to Unauwen. Tell me how much the passage is. Forget the passage. You've done your part. Now let me do mine. Come on. Get your purses out where I can see 'em. We take anything here: gold pieces, silver pieces. We even take copper pieces. If you ain't got nothing, you're not getting on! Greetings, Captain. And may I say, what a bonny vessel you command. Cut the blarney. Show me your money. Or would you prefer the fine reward Prince Viridian will undoubtedly give you when you help us deliver this splendid homecoming gift? She's got no cash, chuck her out, and that one goes with her. So I take it you're not interested in this? How do I know he's not gonna murder us in our beds? Hmm? Eviellan. Pretty rich coming from a cutthroat swindler like you. Lady goes in the passengers' quarters, horse goes in the scuppers, and you, you go with it. He's not sleeping with the animals. Then he ain't coming, is he? I don't care where I sleep. Come on. Oh! Watch your step, milady. And you'd better watch yours. - I'll take it back whenever you're ready. - What? My ring. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Well, what do you know? Tiuri's growing up. Livestock down below! I'll come and find you. I'll hide my purse. If it's good enough for me, it's good enough for you. I'm not scared. Oh. Well, good. Because I can do magic. There's a lot of that about. Milou? Milou? Oh, thank goodness. There you are. Sorry to disturb you, madam. I can do magic, can't I? I can make this whole boat disappear. Of course you can, darling. Can you do magic? She can. She can do magic. Are you headed to Unauwen? Unfortunately, yes. My husband wants to see Viridian's triumphant return. He's an admirer. Me? I just hope there isn't trouble. You think there will be? Who knows what Viridian really wants? But if he really comes in peace... why hasn't he disbanded his army? Come on, you little magician. Let's go find your father. How much longer until we can steal these horses? When they put the lights out, go to bed. I'm freezing my backside off here. Give us a story, Fol. How old do you think we are? Oh, you'll love Foldo's stories. They're really, really scary. - Aren't they, Foldo? - They're true. That's what makes them scary. And none of them are truer... than the tale of Amaris... and the magic that possessed her. There's no such thing as magic. What are we, Eviellan? If you're one of the people who magic can flow though, you won't even know it until it's inside you. That's what happened... to Amaris. She was scarcely eight years old and lived in a cottage deep in the forest with her mother who loved her very much. One day, she'd been out collecting firewood. And when she finally got home, it was dark, and the cottage was strangely silent. No fire in the grate, no stew in the pot. Amaris called out, "Mother?" And her mother's voice called back, "I'm in the cellar." Now, that was strange. Their cellar was dark and cold, and they all hated going down there. And her mother called back, "I've found something! Quick... come and see." So, Amaris lit a tiny candle, opened the door to the cellar... and started to climb down, her little candle barely piercing the terrible gloom. "Don't be scared, my child," her mother's voice called out in the darkness. And just as Amaris reached the bottom of the stairs... felt the cold, wet earth beneath her feet... her candle blew out. And it was then... then that she heard it. Heard what? The front door... opening upstairs... and the voice of her mother... saying... "Amaris, I'm home." What did Amaris do? She couldn't do anything. Because whatever was down there had her now. Finally, Amaris found her voice. "Mother, I'm in the cellar! Hurry!" And her mother hurried, rushing down with a candle. But her little girl had gone. Vanished forever. Gone where? Nobody knows. But she's out there somewhere... all alone. So next time you're walking through the woods, and you get that feeling... like someone's watching you... be very, very careful. 'Cause it just might be the magic... waiting... to take you! Are you crying? Shut up. Tiuri? Tiuri. People are talking... about what Viridian wants to do when he gets home. So whatever's in that letter could be even more important than I thought. I know it's important. I've always known it was important. Yeah, but the point is, our reward just got even bigger. - There she goes again. - What's that supposed to mean? It means not everything is about money. Not everything has to be about what's in it for you. And there he goes again. If everyone just looks out for themselves, the world becomes a horrible place. The world is a horrible place. Then it's up to people like us to do something about it. Or maybe it takes courage you just haven't got. - I'm not scared of anything. - Yes, you are. That's why you're here, thinking about that reward instead of going down that road to find your mother. You spent too long with those monks. You're even more scared than me... and that's saying something. Scared that when you do actually find her... she won't be the answer to all your prayers. Or even worse... you won't be the answer to hers. Behold! Slupor the Sorcerer! Necromancer from the Netherworld! Please give generously, for I have studied the dark arts of that cursed land. You know its name well, but few dare to speak it. Eviellan! On my travels... ...I have seen the serpent of death! I have drunk from the river of blood! And I have spoken to the vengeful, dead Shaman murdered by Prince Viridian, and now their voices cry out for revenge! Search every stinking inch! Red Riders! Search the ship! Cheapskates! Hide! - Where's the Eviellan boy? - He'll be with the horse! Where is he? Get Ardanwen. We need to get off this boat. You're not going anywhere. I had you down as a simple nuisance. You've grown... to a full-blown irritation. - Wait. What are you doing? - This way! Ardanwen, wait! Slow down! May I ask... where you got... that talisman? It belonged to my father. Shaman's blood. My father was a Shaman? You have questions. I have answers. First... we must get off this ship. You never know when you're going to need to quick exit. - You've been chased by Red Riders before? - Worse. Audiences wanting their money back. I know you're out there! We have to go. This isn't over, boy! - Where's Lavinia and Ardanwen? - Get in! What is it? I'm... bleeding. I have you, my boy. So long, Tiuri! Thanks so much for your parting gift! We have to stop. Hush. Calm yourself. We have to go back. We have to find Lavinia. Can't swim! What happened? Your wretched horse all but killed me, that's what happened. That's Ardanwen's specialty. Are you hurt? Ardanwen. Yes. There's no way you can ride. We have to stop the bleeding first. There's a cave not far from here with the herbs I need to make a poultice for that wound. - But we must hurry before they come. - Wait. What's in this for you? Lavinia, please. He saved my life. I know. But why? You are pure Eviellan. I know you are. And I am but a humble disciple of your rich culture. Face paint and cheap tricks. More con man than disciple. A cynic. Good. Every hero needs one. Keeps him grounded. You think he's a hero? Yeah. There's a darkness coming, a darkness that will take everything. And when it comes, only one thing can stop it. You're looking at me. When the storm clouds gather, a hero will rise with the power to face it down. You were born of Shaman blood, Tiuri. You are that hero. Wait. We must go. Just to be clear, this ham is a complete lunatic. You do know that? I like you, young lady. I like you a lot. Come on now. There's no time to waste! Who's a good girl then? Come on. We have to hurry. If I'm forced to steal this horse, I at least want it to know my intentions are honorable. You're riding it, Foldo, not marrying it. Look, I don't want to do this either. But Iona's right. We have to find Tiuri. Why? So we can just hand him over to Fantumar? Go! Go! Go! Thieves! - Grab a horse! Move! - Hyah! Murderers! Hyah! Hey, that was my horse! Steal from an old man, would ya? ♪ Through rain and sleet, blood and snow ♪ ♪ There rode the famous Jussipo ♪ ♪ And beside him Rode his tiresome little bro ♪ - Do you ever shut up? - You'll like this next bit. ♪ Iona always ready to duel ♪ ♪ Sweet Foldo, nobody's fool ♪ ♪ And behind them rode an ass Upon a mule ♪ Not funny. And he's not a mule. I'm taking your horse, Piak. - No, you're not. - I am. This thing's too small for me. Well, you should have stolen something a little bit bigger then, shouldn't you? I say we make camp. I say we don't. But we've been riding all night. And we're still miles behind them, so we keep going. Many years ago, I fought in the Eviellan wars. It cost me my youth and my innocence. But I gained something in return, an understanding of the true power of Eviellan. The power I feel in you, Tiuri. What is this place? A place where no one will find us. Quick. If Tiuri is the hero this legend speaks of, then his mother must've known it too. Why didn't she say something? To protect him, of course... from his destiny. But it has found him now, and there is no escape. Tiuri. Quick, this way. Lie him down here. Here. There's water in the pail. These caves are ancient... from before there was a Dagonaut or an Unauwen... before there were knights and kings... when there was only one land... one power. - Eviellan. - Yes. This has always been a place of healing. He'll be safe here. We need goldenrod flowers and yarrow. You'll find them at the edge of the wood. What are you waiting for? It's fine. Do what he says. I won't be long. Keep an eye on him. Minerals help contain your power during the ceremony. What ceremony? I don't understand. Exactly. This power has to be understood if it's to be controlled. You think everybody born with the gift knows how to use it? To wield true power, you must master it first. And this ceremony's part of my healing? This ceremony is part of the world's healing. I thank the gods above you were sent to me and not to Viridian. If he consumed you... ...our task would be impossible. Con... Consumed me? The Eviellan Shaman weren't just wiped out. First, our noble prince stole their power... burned it from their souls and drew it into his own. But the greatest prize... slipped through his fingers. You. What do you mean "burned it from their souls"? Oh, yes, it is possible for those who have studied such things. Power... can be transferred from one person to another. For it is the power itself that is important... not the vessel that contains it. Especially if that vessel is unworthy. Lavinia! Oh, it's too late for all that. Lavinia! And now, we shall begin! Lavinia! - I did it! - You didn't do anything. Iona did it. Damn it! It's just the girl. You see? If I'd have done it, it would be Tiuri. Says the idiot who stole a mule. - It's not a mule. - I'm most terribly sorry. Will you all shut up and cut me down?! - Of course. - Wait. Where's Tiuri? I've no idea who you are, girl, but I'm not telling you anything until you cut me down! There's no time for this. Tiuri's in danger. Oh, he's in danger, all right. We're the danger. We are the danger knights. Ugh! Seriously, Arman. You're pathetic. - Don't call me pathetic! - What would you prefer? Hello! Right, yes, of course. Spit it out then. Where's Tiuri? Hyah! Well, don't just stand there. Get after her! Passing your powers to me won't be a long process, Tiuri. The fire... will release it from your unworthy flesh. And once it is free, I can consume it at last and become the hero you could never be. Lavinia! Lavinia! Tiuri! Lavinia! That doesn't look good. Tiuri! - Tiuri! - Lavinia! - We have to help him. - Tiuri! There's no way in. Burn away the flesh! Release his powers! Use it, Tiuri! Use your power to save yourself! No! It's done! The power is mine! What? It's not possible. No! No! Ow. You did it. What are you lot doing here?
