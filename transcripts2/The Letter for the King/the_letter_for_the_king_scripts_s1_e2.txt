 Good riddance, you interfering fool. Huh. The Black Knight with the White Face, more like. - Damn it! - What is the meaning of this? I could ask you the same question. This inquiry is to be conducted by me. The man's a knight, and a knight will decide who killed him. That is the Queen's decision, not yours. My Grey Riders will be investigating. This isn't over. Father, I swear...

 Shut up, you turd-witted buffoon. It wasn't our fault. It was Tiuri. He broke the vigil. Is this true? Um... The Black Knight's squire came to the door. Tiuri answered it. He went with him. - Where is Tiuri? - We don't know. He never came back. What's wrong with you? How many times are you going to try and kill me? All right! Get him! Wait! Hyah!

 Go! Go! Slow down! You're going to get us killed. You're going too fast. I can't hold on! Slow down! We've lost him. - Father. - Tiuri? Hey. Hey. What is it? - What's happened? - The Red Riders! They came for the Black Knight. Now, they're coming for me. What are you talking about? Why aren't you at the chapel? I broke the vigil. The Black Knight's squire came to the door last night. He said he needed help, so I went with him. It's not possible. The Black Knight is in Eviellan. No, he's here. The Red Riders killed him. He gave me this, this letter. He said I had to take it to King Favian. He said the fate of both kingdoms was at stake. Which way did he go? You have to hide. Don't come out, whatever happens. Show yourself! I know you're up there. You dare enter my home uninvited? In search of a fugitive, yes, I do. - What fugitive? - Your son. He killed the Black Knight. I couldn't kill the Black Knight, let alone my son. You will tell me where he is and what he's done with the letter. What letter? He stole a letter from the Black Knight. My son has never stolen anything in his life. And what concern of yours is a letter of the Black Knight? - I'm not here to answer your questions. - I don't care what you're here for. And I will not have you drawing me or my family into whatever dark games you and your friends are playing. You dare accuse me? Until I know what this letter is, and who it was from, and what Viridian's Red Riders are doing in Dagonaut, then yes, yes, I do. You spoke to him. I knew it! Where is he? Where's Tiuri? Leave, Fantumar. I won't tell you again. How many times did I tell you? You can clothe them in the finest silk, you can teach them the finest manners, but you'll never wipe away the stench of the Eviellan scum that they will always be. Take him. Take him! For as long as I've known you... you've looked down at me. Well, now... it's my turn. Burn it. Burn it to the ground. Father. You must not get involved in this. Leave the letter. Save yourself. I want you to live, Tiuri. That's all I've ever wanted. What do we do? We could just leave Tiuri to the Red Riders. He'll be no match for Jaro's men. They'll find him. And then what, you fool? That jumped-up cutthroat will waste no time telling Viridian how I lost the letter and couldn't recover it on my own territory. No, we have to get it back ourselves. But how, my lord? Come on. Perhaps my idiot son can be of some use after all. Having a bad day? It's about to get a lot worse. Much obliged. I'm afraid that makes this... goodbye. Do you wanna shut your eyes? Better if you shut your eyes. It's gonna be horse steaks for dinner. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Get after them! Ardanwen! Bloody horse! You're definitely crazy. But I'm actually starting to like you. You want us to find Tiuri? And bring him back to Dagonaut. Dead... or alive. He doesn't mean that literally. Although... dead... would be preferable. This... This doesn't seem right. What do you owe that Eviellan brat? He betrayed all of you! What's in it for us? Bring that murdering fugitive back to face justice, and I guarantee... you will receive the knighthoods... that you've been denied. You... You can make that happen? Why should we believe you? Look at me. Do know how many wars I've fought? Do you know how many tournaments I've won? Um... Eh... None. And yet I stand before you the richest, most powerful knight in the kingdom. You know why? Politics. That's my weapon. I provoke. I tease. I trap. And you lie too, don't you, father? He's amazing at lying. Mother and I can never... The point is... in the end... I always get what I want. You will too... if you bring me... Tiuri. How is that possible? Hyah! Keep going! He's out here somewhere! They've passed. Where are you going? No. That's the wrong way. Unauwen is this way. I hate this bloody horse. Ardanwen, wait! ♪ Outrode the villain Tiuri ♪ ♪ He wrecked the vigil truly ♪ Shut up. ♪ And so we came to hunt him down ♪ For the love of God... ♪ His men did love him truly ♪ ♪ Jussipo was such a beauty ♪ That's it. ♪ The one they called Jussipo Was their king ♪ Arman! That's a nine-crown lute. I told you to shut up. So what? So my father sent us on this quest, and that means I'm in charge. No, it doesn't. Who asked you, toad-snot? Whoa! Whoa! Stop! Help me! If that oaf's put so much as one dent in it, he's paying for a new one. Funny enough... Of course, it couldn't... It couldn't matter less, least of all to me, but I actually believe in purely technical terms... Do you ever actually finish a sentence? Right. Um... - My point being... - Don't worry. It's fine. Panic's over. Actually... sounds a little better. ♪ Sounds a little better ♪ Stop singing, Jussipo. How are we gonna catch Tiuri if he can hear us coming from half a mile away? We're working here. Can't take any more of this pig swill. Fine. It's your loss, Iona! Mistrinaut... sitting between two great nations, divided by a vast mountain range, and just one trading route between them, a route to which our town is the very gateway... - Father? - Your speech isn't worth much, snowdrop, but we might be able to flog this painting for a few bob. How can you have so little vision? For 500 years, that road through the mountains filled this town with gold, and it can do so again. That road has been lost for generations. No, I can find it. Look. Look at these maps. There's a whole valley that's not even been chartered yet. - According to this... - For the last time, there is no road through the mountains. And the wedding is still on. - Verily, madam, your beauty is... - Oh, sit down! Right, yes. Look, all I need is a horse big enough to make the journey and supplies for a month. A modest investment. Lavinia, you are the cream in my milk. You always have been. And I love the fact that you have dreams, but dreams don't pay bills. Look at that. That is all that we have left: a meager trade in wanted men, bail, and reward money. Right now, that trade has never been thinner. I mean, the last decent murderer we had in here was two months ago. We're broke. And that is why you're getting married. We have to restore the trade route. Otherwise, Mistrinaut is doomed. See you at the church. I'm doomed. Ugh. It's not a complicated point I'm making. What I'm saying is the richest knights, the most famous knights aren't necessarily the best knights. Huh? They're just the knights that work hardest at getting their stories out. That's all I'm doing... with this song. I'm not waiting 100 years for some toothless bard to immortalize me. Is it him? Shh! - What? - Whoa! You really scared the bejesus out of me. Almost poo'd me britches. What are you doing here? What do you think I'm doing here? No way I'm missing out on this. Your brother followed us from Dagonaut? Made it in two days. You boys left a trail a mile wide. But, man, you are good. Like real knights. That dagger throw, Foldo! What was that, like 40 yards? And, Arman, great crossbow work, big guy. You almost took me ear off. And, Iona... God's bones! You are quick. I'm mean wolf-quick. Every move I made, you were totally on me. Why are you still talking? Why is any sound coming out of your mouth at all? I was kind of good on the crossbow... Oh, shut up. You're in so much trouble. - What are you doing? - Putting you on your horse. - You're going home. - No, wait. No... I'm not discussing this. - Really? - Really what? Sending him back through those woods, alone? He's just a ten-year-old boy. I'm almost 11. Is this a quest we're on or Madam Twanky's Sunday School? Anything could happen out there. Good. Foldo's got a point, though. What if I go and die? Mum would kill you. Be better if he died. You'd just slow us down. I'm faster than Jussipo. I beat him every time we race around the abbey. You do not. And I sing better too. Mother says his voice sounds like a cat in a bag. Go, Piak. Please, please, Jussipo! I'll make this work. Think about it. Real knights have squires, right? To clean their armor, to carry their weapons, to water their horses. I can do that. Please, don't make me go home. Please! Please! Please! Please! Yes. Stop doing that. Sorry. Clip-clop. Try not to kill anyone while I'm inside. Good morning. I was wondering whether you served food at all. You're a big fella, aren't you? You'd get me over the mountains. That your horse outside? Uh... Well, yes, in a manner of speaking. In a manner of speaking? Where did you grow up? The courtly romance? You're too young to be a knight. Much too small. No offense. So, what? A Novice? Novices don't ride horses like that. I think perhaps I should be going. Yet this cloth's expensive. And that's silk braid. So you're from money. Am I right, or am I right? Thank you for your help, but I really should be going. Good luck out there. You're certainly going to need it. There are more cutthroats and murderers in that street than broken cobbles. I'll bet good money you won't make it past the first doorway, let alone to the town gate. Is there another way out of town? Now that I think about it, there is. Wait here. And don't speak to anyone. I'll check it's clear and then come back for you. - Verily, madam, your beauty is... - Sit down. Uh, why aren't you dressed? We have to be at the chapel by matins, or we'll miss the bloody priest. Oh, forget the chapel. The wedding's off. The wedding's what? Let me handle this. The wedding is not off, and we are not having this argument again. The Eviellan boy who murdered the Black Knight with the White Shield is downstairs right now, and there's a 50 crown bounty on his head. Wedding's off! How could you do this? Grow up, boy. People like you may not need to make a living, but people like us have no choice. Everyone has a choice. Says the rich fool riding around with his thumb up his backside expecting the world to do him a favor. Isn't she a sweetheart? Now... come here, you gorgeous, Eviellan murderer, you. So who posted the reward? Squire named Balin. But the money is from a Sir Fantumar. Never heard of him. But if he's already offering 50, he's worth a lot more. You can't send me back there. Relax, young fella. I'm not sending you anywhere. I'm just selling you to someone who will. See, this Sir Fartalot puts a price on your head, but you're probably worth more. So we shop you... around the local bounty hunters, see if one of them wants to buy you. Then we pocket the cash. They add a markup and do their own deal with Farty-pants. I'll get word to Godwin and Hasley. What exactly is this? I wouldn't do that if I were you. Oh, really? Ow! You don't put something in one of these unless it's really valuable. After all these years, tomorrow we cross that river... and we're on home soil at last. Unauwen will welcome you, Prince Viridian. The letters? Five have been delivered. We're waiting word on the sixth. The scout... the one they call Jabroot... send him to me. Going somewhere, snowdrop? What's it to you? We're not having this conversation again, are we? What happened to your hand? Uh, yeah. Have a look at this. Belongs to our Eviellan guest. Such a bladed box suggests to me that someone has gone to great lengths to secure its contents. Now, you are the best lock picker I know. Can you open it? Don't know. Maybe. Leave it with me. Why don't I think that's gonna happen, hmm? We'll work on it together, later. I mean, you're not going anywhere, remember? Okay. Don't worry about the boy. Your future's brighter with me. Ah! Piece of cake. Proceed. Well, Jabroot? Seventeen Shaman, my lord. And their families. Terrible price to pay. But one that had to be paid to finish this war. Speak. The numbers don't tally. We checked the graves. Two were missing. Who? We don't know yet. One of them might be a Shaman. Again, my lor... The journey... has begun, Jabroot. The prophecy is in motion. So if there's another Shaman... or a child with Shaman's blood running through its veins... I must know. Red Riders. What the hell are you doing? Get back in here! Ristridin. It's you. What have you done, boy? Nothing. If this is you doing nothing, I dread to think of you doing something. - Is there news of my mother? - Your mother is fine. It's the people your mother runs into I'm worried about. Come on. - I'm taking you home. - No. Tiuri? We have to get the Black Night's letter to King Favian. Except I don't have it. Right now, the Mayor has it. We'll get it back from the Mayor and head to Unauwen before the Red Riders get it. You're babbling, boy. The Red Riders are with Prince Viridian in Eviellan. No, it was the Red Riders who killed the Black Knight. Now they're chasing me. They want his letter. This makes no sense. Does the idea of me killing the greatest knight in Unauwen make sense? I scarcely made it through the trials. You of all people know that. If what you say is true, it'll come out when the Queen questions you. Now, let's go! Ristridin, please. There's no time for this. Hi... Morning, barkeep. We're, uh, looking for a boy, about yea high, dark hair, shifty features, riding a stolen horse. Seen him in here? Hmm. I'll, uh... make it worth your while. Four jars of mead, please. Oh, I'm not allowed to drink mead. Mother said... I'll have his. My apologies for the idiots. Mead all around. You want stew? - Uh, maybe we'll pass on the stew. - Yes on the stew. Uh, five, please. Will you lot shut up and let me handle this? You'll get us all killed. Only thing that'll kill us here is that stew. Uh... Oh! I'm most terribly sorry. And here it comes. God's nails! Watch your backs, all of you! Hyah! Hup! Hyah! Do something. Oh! Um, guys? Now what? Well, the boy was an appealing cake, I admit, but, uh... We still have the cherry on top. Thank me later. Tiuri? Tiuri! Cut them off! Hey! Hey! Don't think I don't know what you're doing here. The only reason you came back for me is 'cause you need me to ride my horse. And you need me to get yourself out of here. So that makes us even. Now she's the one person you could have killed. What's all that? - My bags. - Are you joking? Does it look like I'm joking? Help me. We have to go. No one's going anywhere until I get that letter back from your father. - You stole it from him? - Obviously. What kind of a family is this? First, we find my road. I'm going to Unauwen. And that letter is coming with me. When we find it, you can take it to Unauwen... which is to the west. It'll be faster. Give it to me. Fine. I carry the letter. You ride the horse. You two, check the barn! Let's go! We'll lose them in the alleys. Can we just agree... never to come back to this place ever again? Go right! Go right! - Was that...? - Tiuri? - Out of the way! - Whoa! Let's go! That way. Go! There they are. Told you I'd get us out of here. Have we lost them? I think so. What are those? Red Riders. Swim, little fishy, swim. - We'll never outrun them. - We don't have to. If we make it to that cut in the hills, we can lose them in the ravine. The Red Riders. They are here. The boy might be telling the truth. We have to help him. Twos, right wheel! Draw swords! Hyah! Go. I believe you, Tiuri. We'll hold them off as long as we can. What are you waiting for? Take the letter and go! Ristridin. Tiuri. You have... to help... him. - This can't be happening. - They killed the Grey Riders. - What about Tiuri? - What about Tiuri? Ristridin said we should help him. He was dying. He probably didn't know what he was saying. But he charged the Red Riders. - So what? - He saved Tiuri's life. So what? So why would he do that for a traitor? - Who asked you? - Don't shout at my brother. - You shout at your brother all the time! - Because he's my brother! It doesn't matter what Ristridin said or what he did. Right now, help him or kill him, we have to find him first. Maybe... we should have a conversation about that.
