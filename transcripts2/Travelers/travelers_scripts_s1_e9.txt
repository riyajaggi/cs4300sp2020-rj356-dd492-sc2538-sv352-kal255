Manning likes to bluster about ethics and the environment, but he'll fold as always. Besides, this conference is just a formality. Once I put the motion through, it's through. That pipeline will move ahead on schedule.

 No! No, no, no. We'll be out of that conference by noon and still make our tee time. You watch. God. I'm sweating like a pig here. This exercise is gonna kill me. Oh, honey... don't be silly. That isn't gonna be what kills you. Help! Help! Somebody, help! Mmm, smells good. Fine grind, organic. I know it sounds snobby, but just you wait... Tastes even snobbier.

 Thank you. No problem. - Everything okay? - Yeah. No. Um, it's just... What? I don't think I can do this anymore. Do what? This. You... staying here with me. No, you don't need to worry. I talked to your boss. - It's not about my job, Marcy. - So, you talked to my boss? Uh, yeah, it's settled. What were you gonna say? This pretending to be something that we're not... I keep saying that it's platonic, but... if I'm being honest with myself... Oh... It's okay. I... I think maybe... it's best if you found your own place. Oh. Um... I didn't realize... The last thing I want is to upset you. You should go to work. And... don't worry about me. I'll find a place tonight. I mean, it doesn't... have to be tonight. It's fine, okay? I understand. Do you? Don't leave tonight, 'cause I got dinner... David. It is okay. Just, um... You should go to work. Excuse me. - Do you mind? - Yeah, I do. I mind what's going on between you and Carly. Carly? Mmm. Don't pretend you don't know. That'll just piss me off. Right. And we all know what you do when you get pissed off, don't we? I would not suggest you try that with me. Definitely not here. Okay. I'll talk to you man to man, all right? Carly and I had a fight, we separated, you had some fun with her. "Fun with her"? - I seen you around. - If you're implying that Carly and I... I'm just here to tell you that she's the mother of my child, and I'm trying to get my family back together. But if you're in my way... Actually, you're in my way. If you wouldn't mind pressing down. Do you think that this is funny? No, I think it's pathetic. - I have interviewed Carly Shannon... - "Interviewed"? On official business, yes, during which time the bruises on her arms and her forehead were pretty goddamned unmistakable. Okay, accidents happen, man. Not anymore, they don't. Does your wife know that Carly's half your age? You know, if you were smart... you'd realize that Carly's not gonna put up with an abusive, alcoholic, loser beat cop anymore, and you'd move on. I'll wait for the next one. You don't have your GED? Uh, um... that should come through this week. I, uh, did the test already. Just waiting on the papers, Mr. Donald. Uh, Hank. Call me "Hank." So, do you have any experience in landscaping? No, but I'm a fast learner. Um, okay, this question is not intended to be in any way sexist, but it is a requirement of this workplace, so don't be offended. What? Can you lift that bag? Where would you like it? Back on the pile's good. All right. Come on in tomorrow. We'll get you all set up and we'll see what you're made of. Um, I'll, uh... I'll be here at 6:00. Uh, okay, but everybody else will be here at 7:00, so... Sounds good, Hank. Sit down, superstar. School called... and your mother wasn't here, so I had to answer it. You skipped out on another test. I can explain. They're suspending you for a week. I understand. No, I don't think you do. Two of your teachers don't even want you back in their class. Which means you don't have enough credits to graduate. - I can make up the tests. - No, you've already ditched too many of those. Your mother and I have decided that we're sending you to a military boarding school. You're sending me away? Just for eight months. In Idaho. You can get your grades up, learn about responsibility, and reapply to colleges next spring. I think we need to talk about this. Well, I'm sorry. It's not up to you. Gary... Aren't we talking more? Gary! What the hell? It's a combination of digital and mechanical. Not easy to bypass, but definitely based on our tech. Well, I hope so, considering how it was left in my car. I mean, no interface or remote signal? Trying that right now. You're right. It definitely opens remotely. Maybe if I can... No. Shit! Uh, if I can use a proxy... No, that's stupid, too. Hey. If there's one thing you're not... I'm sorry, boss. My head isn't clear. Look, if you need a little to function properly, I won't stop you. No. No. I need to try for at least a few more hours. Staying clean is harder than I thought. - How can I help? - I'm getting help, actually. Support groups. My friend Ray has been taking me. A friend? Oh... Good. Well, can you scan it? See what's inside? If this doesn't work, I'll have to run a few programs, try and brute force a key code. The case is lined. They really wanted to keep it a secret from you. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with the damn thing, other than keep it on me at all times. - The director must have a plan. - Yeah. What else is new? Can I help you? Good morning, Mrs. MacLaren. Do you have a moment to talk? - About what? - Don't be alarmed. I'm actually here about a personal matter. - Hello? - Hey. Sorry, did... did I wake you? No. It's okay. Cool. Um... Anyway, I just wanted to let you know when I was gonna be around today... in case you needed help getting your things. I mean, not that you need help with your things, but if... - if you did... - I can help. Or I can not be around. You know, alternatively. No. Uh... it'd be great if you were there, if you don't mind. - No! No, not at all. - Um... When are you gonna be around? I can be around all day, if that works. Okay, well, uh, I will see you this afternoon. Okay. - Okay. - Bye. Good morning, 3468. - I'm here to brief you on your mission. - You are...? 3112. You can go now. Your target is Congressman Bishop. Target? What is that supposed to mean? That's the word the messenger used. Bishop will be seated next to you... in first class. 1A and 1B. - This flight is today. - Is that a problem? No, I just... To be honest, I've never been in an aircraft before. Shouldn't I have luggage, or... - You have the case. - Of course. That's all you need. Your credentials will get it through security. It will open at the appropriate time, and you'll be made aware of its purpose. I'm gonna need a little more than that. I don't have more than that. If you wouldn't mind dropping me off where I'm going. You do know I'm a federal agent? It's just a few more blocks. Good morning. I know I'm a bit early. I figured I'd get a head start on some... Carly, um, our needs have actually changed, so I'm afraid we don't have a job to offer you. Okay. Uh, well, if you wouldn't mind keeping me in mind for the future... Um, we're never gonna be able to offer you a job here, darling. Sorry. Why not? You know why. No, I don't, actually. Sir, I really need this job. Our background check revealed the charges on your record. Assaulting a police officer? Come on, kiddo. You don't understand. He's the father of my child. And that makes it better... how? You know, the 21st has this service called Uber. You may want... It's my wife. Excuse me. - Hey, Kat. - Where are you? On my way to the airport, apparently. - We need to talk. - I can't right now. I've just been assigned escort duty to DC. The flight's at, uh... 1:30 today. - You're leaving? - Yeah, it's just for one night. I'll call you as soon as I... Kat? At least you weren't ordered to assassinate her. What the hell is that supposed to mean? I'm about to attend a funeral service. What do you think it means? You can pull over here. I'm sorry. I'm trying. You okay? The treatments help. How long have you been doing this? - Just a few weeks. - So it's working? It controls the seizures. I'm just... buying a little time. I'm sorry. The director made a mistake with both of us. I'm sorry because you've had to deal with this all alone. You confided in me... and I've only been worrying about my own problems. I've had help. David. He's been doing this? And drawing the CSF I use to make the serum. He's more than capable, and... He cares for me. I thought he kicked you out. It's not like that. How's it coming? I'm having a hard time understanding how one plant is more important than another, but I'm doing what you asked. We need to talk. Don't think I haven't noticed that things are changing between us. You struck me... and now you're sending me away to military school. Those changes? I'm talking about since you quit football. - Since my concussion? - I'm saying... There comes a time in every young man's life when he stops putting his father up on a pedestal and just sees him... As the man that he really is. Exactly. That guy. - Yeah. - Look, I just... I just wanted to say, you know, guy to guy, man to man... I'm sorry things have gone south between us, and... I'm doing my best here. Oh, and, uh... you don't have to do that anymore. Your mother told me to do it while she was away at her sister's. Gary? Is there golf on later today? One o'clock. Maybe we could watch it together. Here we go. Give me a sec, guys. Carly, how can I help you? You can explain why a background check by a potential employer showed an assault charge. Well, maybe it was after you punched me in my face and stole my car. How many times have you struck me? You know, come to think of it, maybe it was after you kicked me in my nuts outside the babysitter's house. - A witness probably called it in. - Right. Well, I'm sure someone inside will be interested in hearing the other side of the story. They all know I'm a good family man. What do you want? I want us. - My son. My family. - Oh, my God. All right, Jeff, I'm gonna let you in on a secret. Okay? That night you smashed my head into the kitchen counter? You were gonna kill me. - What're you talking about? - Let me tell you how. I was gonna open the kitchen drawer, to get out your spare gun to defend myself, but you were going to be too strong and too fast. The gun was gonna go off, and I was going to bleed out on the floor. That is batshit crazy talk. Carly, you need help. What I needed was a decent job, and you just took that from me. Smooth. Philip, you there? - What's up, boss? - I'm heading out of town. I just received mission instructions through another traveler. Where do you want us? I can be ready in five. No, this one's a solo assignment. I'm flying to DC. I'll be out of com reach when the plane gets above 20,000 feet... which is a terrifying thought unto itself, but I'll check in by cell once we're on the ground, about 6:30 your time. Statistically, it is the safest way to travel. Well, strapped to a chair moving through the sky, but thanks for trying. Good evening. Hello. - Oh. Hi. - Mr. MacLaren. Perfect. And just to your right. Hi! Welcome. Perfect. And just down the aisle to your right. Oh. Sorry. Sir? I can stow that in the overhead compartment if you like. No, no, I'll keep it with me. Thanks. Hi! Welcome. Perfect, sir, and just down the aisle to your left. Hello. Mr. Bishop? Perfect. And just here to your right. Hi. Excuse me. What a day. Yeah. Same here. - I'm, uh... - Excuse me. Jim? Yeah, it's me. I'm on the plane now. Just left the funeral. Well, it was fine. It was a funeral. Yeah, you know I'm ready. I've already spoken with the board. Hayes' death shouldn't hold up our plans at all. We'll get the bill signed, have the pipeline flowing in no time. Okay, see you back in DC. Bye. Okay. Mac? You've reached Special Agent Grant MacLaren. Please leave a message at the tone. Hey, it's me. Um... I really need to talk to you. It's Jeff. He is literally sabotaging my identity. I think you're the only one that can help. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. You'd think the executive class would be more spacious, huh? Well, I don't really have a frame of reference. - First time up front? - Mmm-hmm. Not a lot of difference at 35,000 feet. Same paper-thin aluminum tube as back there. - Paper-thin? - Oh, relax. You got a better chance of being eaten by a shark than being in a plane crash. Well, then, I'm glad we're not flying over water. Sir? Gonna have to ask you to turn off your phone, please. I'm a US Congressman. It's fine. Well, it's a privilege to have you on board, Congressman, but we still need you to turn off your phone, please. Once we're in the air, you'll have full access to our wifi. Thank you. I tell you, not many perks to positions of power these days. Front row. - What do you do? - FBI. Special Agent Grant MacLaren. Ted Bishop. Should've known by the suit, right? I'm just kidding. So I guess you heard about Secretary Hayes' death? Your division handling that? - We are. - Well, good on you. Woop, we're off. Oh. Good. You said I needed help, and you're right. - I need help with our son. - Right now? Call it a peace offering. Carly, I'm not stupid. And I'm not gonna play babysitter every time... I have a couple of job interviews. I'm just gonna have to tell the truth on the applications. See what happens. If you really want to start mending this relationship, here's the chance. Hey? Hey, big guy. How much time do you need? How about you spend a few hours with your son... see what it's like? Hey, hey, hey! Come on. You chill with Dad for a bit. Huh? Go for some ice cream? Play some Space Kabob. Shoot some guns? I'm just joking. We're not gonna shoot no guns. - Hey. - Hey. Come in. Come on in. I, uh, I haven't packed up anything... up for you, 'cause I wasn't sure what you wanted. Oh, I don't have much stuff. Yeah, no, I was meaning more, like, my stuff that you might need. I'm not taking your things, David. But why do I need all this stuff for myself? I mean, do you have a kettle? 'Cause everybody needs a kettle for, like... tea. - So take it. I insist. - Okay. This is... This is a lot harder than I thought it was gonna be. Yeah, it's hard for me, too. - Is it? - Mmm-hmm. I don't know if that's possible, Marcy, because I feel like I'm dying here. - What? - Nothing. No, you were gonna say something. Thank you for the kettle. That's not it. What were you gonna say? Tell me. I'm dying. You mean that you feel the same way? I do feel the same way, but... that's not what I'm saying. No. The seizures that you've been helping me treat, those are... those are just symptoms. This is way too fucking much. Everything that we've been doing... has just been to buy time. I don't have that long. And you were just gonna leave? I don't want you to have to go through all of that. What have I been telling you about doing stuff alone? I mean, do you have any idea what that would've done to me, knowing that I kicked you out? When? Not today. I could just hack in and remove the charges. No, that won't do it. He'll just refile. I need MacLaren to get involved, use his FBI influence. He said he'd touch base once he landed. Okay. 1:30 for DC, right? Uh... Flight 329 to Washington. It just took off. 329... No. No, no, no, no, no. No... no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What? Marcy? - We have a problem. - Copy. Copy what? Trevor, we have a problem. Copy that. Um, uh, excuse me. - I, uh, gotta take a leak. - Oh. Sure. Kat? What are you doing here? Oh, God. Grant, I'm sorry. This is so embarrassing. What? I thought I was gonna find you on here with another woman, and then I saw you talking to that man up front, and I realized that I made a... Ladies and gentlemen, your captain from the flight deck. Uh, we've just entered an unexpected area of turbulence. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts. For Christ's sake, Kathryn, I'm working. A police officer came to our house this morning and said that you're sleeping with his wife. What? That's... He told me her name and said that he's seen you leaving their house. Sir, we need you to take your seat. - Just a second. - No, now, sir. I'm a federal agent. Well, I'm a flight attendant! Go back to your seat! I'm not asking again. Grant, it's fine. We can talk later. Just go. This is nothing. Don't worry. Guys, can you hear me? It's Mac. Can anybody hear me? Boss, can you hear us? The plane hasn't descended far enough yet. Anybody? Can anybody hear me? Yeah. We can hear you. Is everything okay? No. No, I think we're descending. Has the case opened yet? Uh, not... not yet. Philip, what can you tell me about this flight? I didn't realize this was your flight until it was too late. Flight 329 to Washington goes down at 2:53 p.m. on this day. Are there any survivors? Boss... all 141 people on board die. Bet you wish you had that free drink. Ladies and gentlemen, your captain again. One of our gauges is acting up over here, probably nothing, but, uh, we've begun a slow turn. Christ. Have we turned around? I have to be in Washington by 4:00. - Stand by. - Jesus, you smell that? What is that? Lithium batteries catch fire in the cargo hold. - Something's burning. - What? How does it go down? The plane's already descending and has made a slow turn back, but doesn't make it. Tell me how to stop it. Tell the pilot you need to depressurize and climb. Sir, if you don't sit down right now... Tell the Captain we need to depressurize and start climbing. Captain, there's smoke in the cabin! The fire's burned through the cargo liner. Flight systems will eventually fail. Excuse me. Do you know... It's too late to stop it. Well, I'm pretty sure it is my mission to save this plane. Don't tell me... Wait. Stand by. Grant! What's happening? Grant! - What the hell are you doing? - I have my mission. Trevor, you need to tell me how to make a two-person stasis field hold more than two people. - Who's Trevor? - Those things use a ton of power. What is that thing? Who are you talking to? Just shut up for a second! Find a way. This is why you were kept in the dark on this one. What do you mean? We keep improvising. The director must have known you'd try and save everyone on the plane. You can't do it, boss. I'm not trying to save everyone, I'm trying to save my wife, who decided to surprise me mid-air. I'm talking about three people. There has to be a way. Stand by. A stasis field means he's going to need resuscitation. Yeah, I know, I'm prepared for that, but... Wife's not on the manifest, same with MacLaren. They've already been scrubbed. - By who? - Why does it matter? Because technically none of us were given this mission. And we keep improvising, and in case you haven't noticed, the future doesn't seem to like it when we do that. Mac's in trouble! We're not turning back! Tell me what the hell's going on. - There's a fire in the cargo hold. - What? We're gonna get through this, but you have to listen to me and do exactly as I tell you. Ladies and gentlemen, we've had a small fire in our cargo hold. The fire suppression system has activated. I'm confident we'll be fine, but as a matter of caution, we are performing an emergency descent. Look at me. Look at me. The captain's wrong. This plane is gonna crash and nothing can stop that now. - Oh, my God. - But I have a device. - What? - This box... can generate an energy field that will temporarily hold our bodies in stasis during the crash and throw us clear of the debris field. Oh, my God, I'm gonna die. No, we're not gonna die. - Go ahead. - Who the fuck are you talking to? I ran the numbers back to front. There's no way the stasis field generator can expand to fit three people. We have to try. Don't! It's a question of mass. Even two people is gonna be a stretch, considering your angle of impact and velocity. I'm sorry. We can't save her. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to prepare for emergency landing. We have approximately five minutes to prepare the cabin for landing, so undivided attention is very important. Five minutes! Require you to open a door, immediately pull the red inflation handle located at the base of the door to ensure proper slide inflation. Okay. It's time. The seatbelt sign is on, sir! Don't try to stop me. Please. Come on. Now. I'm not going anywhere with you. Every other person on this plane is gonna die today. But you, for some reason, get to live, so be humble and grateful, and get your ass out of that seat before I drag it out. Ladies and gentlemen, we will not make the airport. We'll be making an emergency landing. When I give the command "brace, brace"... assume the position the crew has demonstrated until the plane comes to a complete stop. Thank you. What are you doing? Before we brace for landing... - Back in your seats, now! - Grant? Where are you going? Face down in your lap, and wrap your arms underneath your knees. If you are unable to assume this position, cross your wrists and place them on the seat back in front of you. Rest your forehead on the seat back. Children should lean forward, feet flat on the floor... - Sit here. - Heads facedown in laps, and wrap their arms underneath their knees. Stay calm, and we're gonna be all right. I don't think I believe you anymore. It doesn't matter if you do or not. Just do as I say when I say it. - Philip? - Go ahead. Tell me about the crash site. Uh... They lose control of flight surfaces any moment now from fire damage below. So it comes in steep and hits in the middle of a field. There isn't much left, but, uh... But what? The tail section is the only part of the plane left intact in every picture in historical record. So someone could survive if they were in the tail section? No! That's not what he said! The G-forces would be huge! - Thank you. - You can't! You don't have time to save her! - Stay here. - You're leaving me? I'll be right back. Don't move. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Sir, sit down! Sorry I took so long. Wait. Where are we going? You were not supposed to be on this flight. I know, I'm sorry. So I'm improvising. Come on. Traveler 3468, you are off mission. - Oh, my God. - Come on. Grant, what did she say? - What was she talking about? - Just stay with me. - Here. - Who the hell is this? This is my wife. She's gonna use the device with you instead of me. - What device? - Just... Here, hold this tight and get close to each other. Come on. Closer. Closer. Whatever you do, don't let go of each other. Do you understand? No, I don't understand. Just trust me and listen. When that light flashes red, press it down. You hold it down, okay? That's all you have to do. - No! Why can't you? Where are you going? - You can do this. No! Don't go! You're gonna be okay. Forty-five seconds. We see you coming in. Good luck. Heads down! Stay down! Brace! Brace! Brace! Brace! Brace! Brace! We need to separate them! Get her shirt. Where is he? Clear? Oh, goddamn him! Clear? He put himself in the tail. - Hi. - We made it. - We actually made it! - Hi. It's okay. - It's okay. - Where's Grant? That son of a bitch was telling the truth. Grant! Where's Grant? - Grant? - Oh! You're not the EMT team I was expecting. I'm Traveler 3569. 3326. Welcome to the 21st. Oh, shit... - Wait. - How'd they get here so fast? - No! No! - Wait! Wait! Carly, no! We're not supposed to be here! Let go of me! Let go! No! Let...
