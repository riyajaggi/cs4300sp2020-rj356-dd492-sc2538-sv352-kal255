 Let go of me! Where's my husband? We can't leave him there! We have to go back! Shut her up, Marcy. We'll have to do more than that. We can't have her remember any of this. Sooner or later, I'll need to give her an HDAC2 inhibitor. What? Who the hell are you people? Let go of me! Can you hurry up? She's stronger than she looks. It's coming. Could you at least slow down a little? We can't be tied to the crash site in any of the media reports.

 Kathryn! Just relax. How do you know my name? Okay. Listen to me. My husband was on that flight. He's with the FBI. He had this device, that's what saved me, and... That should buy us some silence until I can administer the inhibitor. I don't know how he stands her. Boss, are you there? MacLaren can't possibly hear you. In fact, I doubt the G-forces of an impact like that are survivable. Somebody thinks it is. The EMTs who took him were our people. They had to be. She's right. They had to have known when and where the plane was coming down.

 The director would've assigned a team to resuscitate him and Bishop. Try his cell phone. - Hello? - Who is this? Deal with the wife, then come to OPs ASAP. Is he alive? Clean up the mess you created, then we'll talk about the next steps. Should I put her in bed properly? You don't have to whisper. You could scream at the top of your lungs and she wouldn't hear you. Especially after I give her this. Do you have a memory inhibitor in your bag? Yeah, every traveler medic has to have a few doses on hand in case of emergencies. How much will she forget? Most of yesterday. I do not envy the hangover she's about to wake up with. Okay, grab a pair of shoes for him, too, then go help Philip set the scene. Oh, the fun they had. How much alcohol would it take for someone to black out the previous day? I don't know. I only use heroin. Let's go with "lots." You can put the weapon down. We're not a threat. Who are you? Traveler D13. "D"? D is for doctor. Also, in my case, Derek. I thought your team was reserved for heads of state. That was our first mission, yes. But now we save whoever the director tells us to save, worldwide. We've already started the work. Can he be saved? If we can stabilize him, stop his internal hemorrhaging, replace or rebuild one or more of his organs, assuming one of you is a suitable living donor and willing to volunteer. Of course. Then maybe. Oh... Ow. Oh, my... Grant? Grant? He looks a lot better than he did last night. On the outside. That's the easy part. But all the damage is on the inside. His brain, his major organs. Took all night just to stabilize him. They don't really look like they're working on him at all. That's because nano technology's doing most of the work. Really? Graphene-based? As advanced as I've ever seen. I mean, without them, with that amount of internal damage... he wouldn't have stood a chance. But even a full suite of medical nanites can only do so much. Well, I'm in over my head here, and there are more loose ends I gotta clean up, so... Where are you going? The airport. If he wasn't on the plane, why is his car parked there? Right. Go. All right, 0115, you're up. Ready when you are, Derek. We've grown it to the first stage, but we have to grow the organ the rest of the way internally. Yeah, where you growing it? You have to cut me open? Cut you? No. It'll find its own way. I don't really like the sound of that. You're not gonna like how it feels, either. Lay down, please. This is gonna hurt a lot. I'm scrubbing in. You're welcome to, but it's not necessary. He's the leader of my team. I wasn't asking for permission. I... pay here? You, uh, mind if I look at your license and registration, please, sir? Right, I should have that... Just, uh, picking it up for a friend. Uh-huh. It says here this vehicle is registered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That's who my friend works for. Step out of the vehicle, please, sir. Is there a problem? I have his key. Uh, Grant MacLaren's... Yeah, you read that on the registration. Now step out of the vehicle. Turn around. I'm sorry, I can't do this. Do you mind opening the gate, please? Adding stage-3 nanites. I've never seen that before. Are you all right? Absolutely. Now let's see if this pancreas needs to be replaced. Ready suction? We're getting close. The bathrooms are done. The kitchen looks great. This place is gonna feel like home in no time. Oh, what? Is the vacuum cleaner broken? No, I don't think so. Just sucked up something underneath the couch. Oh. Got it. Oops. Don't look at me. It's your fault they're under there. I'm just worried I'm gonna find your bra in here next. Stop. We need another unit of blood. I'll go get it. You still with me? What? You've been quiet. I was thinking... - About never trying bodysurfing again? - There's that. Whenever I'm on vacation for any length of time, I just start thinking about how much more I could be doing with my life. Like? I don't know. My dad was a cop, now I'm FBI. I mean, Jesus. Talk about lack of imagination. But you love the FBI. Well... like. And you're really good at it. So I keep telling you. Well, maybe you're just ready for a new challenge that doesn't have to come from your work. Oh, God, we're about to have the baby discussion again. - Did I even say the word? - Oh, it's so... - I can see it all over you. - Stop! It's in your eyes. I know that look. Oh, shoot. We've got a flat tire. It's okay. How's he doing? Sternal fracture... hemothorax and pulmonary contusion. Whatever. I mean, how's it looking? Is he gonna be all right? It's way too soon to say. We've barely started. Plus... there's a problem with his heart. - What's wrong? - It's damaged... beyond the nanite repair capability. The director wouldn't have sent them if there wasn't a chance. The director's not infallible. But he is in the best hands I know of in any century. Okay. Did you find it? Hmm? Oh. Yeah, that's it. Thanks. Yeah. I wish I could be more helpful. You are helping. Yeah, clearly you'd be lost without me. I really would be, Grant. Hey. I just got a call from local PD. Parking attendant called in a vehicle theft. License plate matches Mac's SUV. Seriously? I just texted him. Maybe he doesn't know yet. You've reached Special Agent Grant MacLaren... Hello? Hey, Kat. It's Walt. Is Mac with you? - I thought he was with you. - No. I guess we're getting our wires crossed. Look, sorry to bother you. Uh, wait. I... Hello. Shit. Hey... You don't look good. Thanks. - I'm serious. - I can tell. You should lie down. Guys? What is it, Philip? We have a situation. - I need an evac. - How fast? Now? All right. Hang tight. I'm on my way. You need to tell the doctor. Maybe something isn't right. Derek? He's the one who told me it was gonna hurt. They can give you something. Little pain toward a good cause... A lot of pain toward a good cause. Go help Philip. I'm fine. The nanites have nearly repaired the pancreas. Good. But if they can't normalize his neural activity, it won't matter how well we fix his body. Okay, good. Now it's time to take the shot. All right? I need you to stand as still as possible. All right? Apply gentle but steady pressure to the trigger. The shot should almost come as a surprise, okay? Your breathing should stay... Surprise! Kat, you need to take firearms seriously. I'll show you how serious I am. And you need to keep your barrel downrange. Mmm, you need to keep your barrel downrange. You said you wanted to do this, - but if you don't... - No. I do. I do... I like it here. It feels dangerous. 'Cause it is dangerous. - Now, come on. - Okay. Okay. Let me try again. All right. - Now, take your aim. - Mmm-hmm. - And gently... - Ooh! Squeeze the trigger. Oh, my God! I shot a gun. - Come on, two more shots. - Okay. Hey! Look at that. Five shots, and the target's completely unscathed. That is a record. Oh... I'm not sure I like that I liked that. Well, you did it. You don't have to like it. I like that I like you. Like? Really? That's... that's the best you got? Really, really like? Kinda prefer a different word. Want? Oh, I hadn't thought of that word. - Need? - That's even better. - Now? - Yeah. That's my favorite one so far. I need you to run a facial recognition check. This is the guy who took off with Mac's SUV. Well, I'll give you this one for free. That's Philip Pearson. Your partner had me run him a few weeks ago. Are you sure that's him? Yeah, MacLaren got all aggro about it. Won't be forgetting that face any time soon. That's Philip Pearson. I've started to worry that we're gonna regret not having children. Are you having actual regret, or just the fear of having regret? The fear one, I think. What about you? I'm gonna plead the fifth. Grant, we haven't talked about it in ages, and we're getting older. You can say that again. But there's new technologies. It's amazing what they can do now. And you'd be such a great dad. I think you're forgetting how hard it was for us. You mean for me. Well, it took us a long time to climb out of it. I know. And I... I'm pulling these 60-hour weeks lately. All right, I get it. I just... I'm afraid that if it happened again... I know. I just... I know. You're gonna be late. Yeah. Beth here. Walt, Mac's SUV was found dumped in a back-alley parking lot, suspect not on scene. - They bringing it in? - Not anytime soon. You're not answering your phone. Kat, I'm sorry, it's been busy. Do you know where he is, Walt? Not yet. He's not with me. He's not with you, although, apparently, we both have messages saying otherwise. Right. You wanna walk with me? If we sounded the alarm every time an agent's whereabouts were unknown for a few hours... What I don't get is the lies. It could be anything at this point in time. Right now, all we know is his SUV's been stolen. Wait. What? I'm at the pick-up spot. Where are you? I'm in an alley one block south. Police are close. All right, I'm coming. Police, west entrance. Oh, God. Aah! Oh, God, I'm sorry. I spilled hot coffee on myself. Oh! Oh, I'm in your way, aren't I? Uh, sorry. Sorry. Um, hang on, hang on. Thanks. MacLaren. I got it. All right. I'll be there. Oh, good. This takes forever with one person. How do corporate clients always seem to know which materials aren't in stock? Now? All hands on deck. - But I booked those hands in advance. - I know. I'm sorry. Sorry. What do you want me to do? You can not pick up your phone for once. Yeah, and they could not give me a paycheck, which only pays for everything we have. You're right. I should be happy that I get to spend any time at all with you and grateful that I'm so well provided for. - That is not what I meant. - Yeah, it is, Grant. - It's exactly what you meant. - Kat... You know what? Just, please, go to work. What do you... That explains why we lost his GPS. So, you notice anything out of place? No. Well, at least there's no sign of a struggle. Jesus. I hadn't even considered that. Oh, sorry, professional reflex. You know what the weirdest part is? It doesn't feel completely unexpected. What do you mean? Lately, I found myself questioning things I didn't think had any mystery left in them... like my husband. Oh, God, Walt. Maybe I'm losing my mind. No, you're not losing your mind. I've noticed some things myself. Really? Little things, like all of a sudden he's a much better shot. He's suddenly much better at a lot of things. Yeah... Definitely not squash. Last night, we... What? What happened? That's the thing. I don't really know. I woke up to a disaster of a kitchen full of empty wine bottles, but... I don't remember attending the party. I mean, it's not unusual for us to have a glass of wine or two if he gets home at a decent hour, but... he sent me a text this morning, said that I was in "rare form." Well, Kat, you can be pretty entertaining when you've had a few. But I don't remember having anything! I mean... I woke up this morning feeling hungover, but never in my life have I been blackout drunk, certainly not on a Tuesday night at home. It's like my life derailed, but nothing happened. Look, maybe you're just stressed. Let me drive you back to your car. You sure you don't want to drive me to the asylum? That is way out of my way. They're gonna be looking for me. I'll get eyes on Forbes. Okay, hold him down. Okay. Clamps. Pass me the gauze. We can't wait. We've gotta do this. Scalpel. It's time. Time? Come on, old man, you got this. I'm beginning to see that time is like a river... That you can throw the biggest rock that you can find into the river, but the water just goes around the rock. It's not optimal, but we have no choice. And it continues downstream... as if the rock... was never there. Time to go. What're you doing? What does it look like? No. Just leave it. I don't know how healthy it is to leave all this stuff out. You weren't sure whether we should set the nursery up before the baby was born. You're gonna throw that in my face, too? No. Come on! Just leave it. I wanna deal with it. You should be resting. Oh, God, I am sick of resting. I'm just putting some stuff away for now. If you want to help... Why? Aren't we gonna try again? Was that it? It's over? Every time you pass this room... you stand in the doorway and you stare. Yeah, I did that before. Well, I think maybe it meant something different before you lost the baby. No, before we lost the baby. This isn't just something that happened to me. You're absolutely right about that. Because I almost lost you. I spent a whole day and night in a hospital room alone waiting to see whether or not you were gonna make it. I was sad we lost the baby, but just the thought of losing you was so much worse. And I'm sorry if that makes me a selfish asshole, but... Yeah. I'm putting a few things away. It's not like we haven't heard from him today. If even you don't know where he is... We don't keep tabs on each other. He doesn't know where I am half the time either. His vehicle was stolen and he's not answering the phone. We will figure it out, Kat, okay? I will tell you the minute that we hear anything. - All right? No problem. - Thanks, Walt. - Forbes. - Yeah, hi. It's Beth. - Go ahead. - I, uh... I found something on Mac. You're gonna want to see this. Okay, I'm on my way up. - Kathryn? - Yes. And no. Do you understand? These aren't my memories. No. - I'm not Grant MacLaren. - No. And yes. These were his memories. Only the brightest shards... fragmented and incoherent. Orphaned neurons of your host's mind cut off from you. Normally, you never would have had access to them. Why now? You are very near death. I can feel it. We're trying to save you. Tens of thousands of nanites working in concert to repair damage to your prefrontal cortex and throughout the rest of your body. Your consciousness was given access to these memories as a refuge. - Show me more. - There are no more. Those were the last remnants of him. I loved you so much. He did. They're his memories, not yours. So why can't I tell the difference? Cross-clamping the aorta. Okay. Here we go. Scalpel. Tissue is presenting normally, but it's fibrillating. Let's get it in and get it charged. Hey. Check your email. - What'd you find? - Mac's GPS data. Uploaded to the cloud. Everywhere MacLaren's SUV has been in the past month and a half. - I marked a few places of interest. - This is great. I pulled Philip Pearson's file. Saw his lawyer is Ray Green. Why am I not surprised? Guess who bought an old garage up near the tracks the day after his client won the lottery? MacLaren's been there a bunch of times. There you go. Oh, shit. - I'll get started on a warrant. - Shit! We have to move! What? MacLaren's partner's coming. Do you know what they're doing to him in there? - The mission comes first. - Stop him. I can hack into the system, slow him down with the warrant, stall him for a couple hours, maybe, but eventually, he will be coming! Why these memories? They could be random... or these memories were so strong they survived your arrival. What's happening? It's time to go. Go where? We'll see. Are you coming? No. And yes. - He's not responding! - Charge again. Clear! - Again! - Charge! Clear! You've reached Special Agent Grant MacLaren. Please leave a message. Jesus, Mac. Hello? Can I help you? I'm looking for Philip Pearson. Uh... who? Pearson. I know he's here. And you are? Special Agent Forbes. FBI. Well, in that case, I'm gonna need to see a warrant. Tell me again why I shouldn't take you in. You know why. I'm a hacker. How am I gonna do that from jail? Mac? Now look what you've done. What's going on? Someone needs to be reminded of the dynamics of our working relationship. You're working with this kid? No, no, no. He's working for me. A distinction that seems to have slipped his mind. I was just trying to show you how vulnerable you are. You shut up. Mr. Pearson is one of my confidential informants on the hacking case I was working. I promised to keep him out of the system if he promised to stop breaking the law. Did I or did I not prove to you that I could steal your car? You don't even have a license. I can make one of those, too. He claims that if he could hack my life, bad guys could, too. I'm telling you, man, you guys are not secure. Yeah, all right, that's enough. Hey, thanks for the tip on my car, Walt. Wasn't hard to figure out who did it. Why didn't you call me back? - You didn't get my texts? - No, I didn't get them. I texted you, like, three times. Uh, sorry, guys. He didn't get them. They were redirected. I was proving a point. I'm gonna need to call off the cavalry. - Everyone's out there looking for you. - What? You went offline and your car was stolen. Oh, Jesus. Are you listening to this? I did you a favor. How do you people not see that? Your security is shit! You're probably vulnerable, too. My fee is extremely reasonable. If you weren't his CI... Shh, shh. I'm sorry. I had no idea he's doing this. Look, it's not like I don't have anything better to do than chase your ass all over town. I'll make it up to you. It's not me that you have to worry about. Call your wife. Uh... Walt! "Your fee is extremely reasonable?" I was improvising! But I think we pulled it off. Thought I was gonna pass out. You've had enough of that for one day. The nanites still have a few hours' work. You have no business being on your feet. So I should take a sick day, is that what you're saying? I'm saying, if you want to avoid external scarring, you have rest for at least two more hours, and no sexual activity for the next 36 hours, until the nanites have left your system. Well, I'll try to restrain myself. - Thank you. - It was our pleasure. How about hooking me up with some of that sweet nano tech? Nanites are by directive only. Sorry. - I got school tomorrow, Derek! - Lucky you. We have to fly across the world to save the life of a genocidal dictator. Why would you do that? Presumably, he's better than the alternative. It was a pleasure working with you, 3569. - Same here. - Get some rest. And... I wanted you to know, if there was anything we could do for you... Yeah. It's all right. I understand. Take care of yourselves. Kat? Hello? Kat? You home? There you are. I tried your cell phone. I turned it off. Now you know how it feels. I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't stop myself from checking it to see if you were alive or dead, and it was making me crazy, so I shut it off. And then I found myself enjoying the feeling, so I kept it off. Well, it's actually a funny story. My CI stole my car. - He hacked into my phone... - You know what, you can tell me tomorrow. I'm sure it's an interesting story, but right now I'm tired, and I wanna have a bath. You need me to wash your back, or...
