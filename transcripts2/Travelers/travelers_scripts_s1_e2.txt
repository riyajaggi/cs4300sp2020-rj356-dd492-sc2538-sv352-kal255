 I see we all made it. Let's begin. So, any issues I should know about? The intel on my host was way off the mark, but I'm handling it. We all knew assuming the lives of people from another century wasn't going to be a walk in the park. Actually, you should try a walk in the park sometime. It's lovely. Thanks. I'll do that. All come are set for voice activation.

 All good? Yeah. Loud and clear. When'd you have a chance to build come? After school. Okay. Ready? Freeze! The material's safer where it is. Dr. Delaney, the entire power grid is down, and your emergency backups aren't designed to last for more than a few hours. Your transport unit is untested. The road vibration alone could cause containment failure. Any distance we manage to take it is better than here. Bullshit. This isn't about safety. You want a new weapon.

 We're ready to load up, Major. Copy. Doctor. - Agent MacLaren? - Yes? You called in that you were in pursuit of a suspect. Do you need backup? Yes. We were forced to take him out. I was. That's the body over there. There's also a police officer locked out on the roof. Okay. We can take it from here. - Got it. - All right. I'm Traveler 3185. This is your containment unit. You can trust it. I thought we were meeting en route. No plan survives contact with the past. You must be new. Yeah, six minutes ago. How's that for timing? Go save the world. Thanks. No pressure. The convoy is approaching our location. Copy. We're getting in position. They're passing us now. Major, the containment unit. It's failing. What? We're detecting micro-annihilations. - So she was right. - I wouldn't say that, sir. But we won't make it to our facility. We're looking at an explosion in the megaton range. Stop the convoy. At this point, an antimatter detonation is inevitable. I want everyone to turn around and get as far away from here as you can. Copy that, Major! - Wilson! - Sir. The road ahead's clear. I'll be following just behind. We'll take it as far as we can. Go. I'll catch up. You're not following him? What? Nothing. I'm just looking you over. Well, he looks like his picture. So how do you feel about older men? I asked myself that this morning. - Agent MacLaren came to see me. - What? He's a lot like you. So much, I almost thought I was talking to you. Well, not as charming, I bet. Oh, no, he was charming. It even crossed my mind to warn him not to follow us tonight. Well, the next available host candidate was a morbidly obese meat salesman, so thanks for keeping that thought to yourself. Well... this one's too soft. Or do you like that? I don't think there's a safe answer to that question. Containment truck historically one minute out. Copy. We're in position. They're trying to get outside the blast radius. The truck is on its own now. Okay, guys? Sir, I could use your help up here. This is Wilson. The road ahead was supposed to be clear. I'm jamming his radio. Does anybody copy? Lady, you do not want to be here! I said, you do not... Okay, he's out! Transfer complete. Pick it up, guys. Charge is set. Okay. We're good for roughly 40 hours. Well, that went about as well as I could have hoped. Yeah. There it is. We've just officially changed history. We just saved 11,000 people. Except for the guy who was driving that truck. One piece of history that we couldn't change. At 0830 tomorrow... today, we'll hand off the antimatter to the arriving team leader, - and our first mission will be complete. - Yeah. Philip and I can handle that. Why? Well, Trevor's got school, and Carly's got a baby, and you've got a wife you got to go home to and meet for the first time, so... Right, my wife of 11 years. Okay. You two do the hand-off. We'll meet later on. I'll get you home. Great work, everybody. Hi. Did you have anything to do with the blackout? No. Then... did you have anything to do with the FBI? An agent called. He said he stopped by earlier. You know, I don't get a lot of FBI agents calling. - Was his name MacLaren? - Yes. Well, would it help you if I told you I work with him? Yeah, it would. It would help a lot. It'd make a lot of sense, actually. Okay. And it's all good, this FBI business? Yeah, it's all fine. Okay. Well, it's late. One more question. Why are you here? Staying in my apartment... with me? David, there's gonna come a time where I'll need your help. My help? Mmm-hmm. I mean, honestly, there's... there's not that many people I can trust. But if it's... if it's not okay... No. Uh... It's fine. I wish you could come in. There's a babysitter. Well, I guess we'll just have to wait until... Yep. That's you, all right. Hello? Hello? Couldn't even make it upstairs, huh? Oh. Uh, no, I didn't want to wake you. Tough night? Uh... a long night. There you go. Thanks. Oh, no. Is the milk off? You know, the power was out almost all night. I am going to the fabric store later today. Do you want me to pick up that linen for your mother? My mother? That milk is fine. This is cow's milk. What animal were you expecting? You know, I don't know if we're gonna be seeing them this weekend, but I can still pick it up. Yeah, sure. That's great, Kathryn. Kathryn? What? You haven't called me by my full name since our first date. Yeah. What's that about? You need to take a nap. You're not safe to drive when you're this tired. Hmm. I gotta go... 'cause I've got that big meeting today. Good luck. Thank you. Have a great day... - Kat. - Take a nap! Uh-huh. Trevor! Get up! - I'm up! I'm up! I'm up! I'm up! - Up! I'm up, okay? Breakfast is on the table. Hey, it's Marcy. I'll meet you at the T.E.L.L. Oh. Hey, Marcy, don't sneak out on me. I've been thinking, and I want you to come to the hospital with me. No. No? You can't pretend that you didn't have a seizure two days ago. I mean, whatever else is going on, that was real. And it wasn't a little thing. I'm not gonna pretend that it didn't happen. You need to see a doctor. I am a doctor. What? Wanna know what a doctor would say? That I had something like an absence seizure. That the electrical signals in my brain repeated themselves over and over in a three-second pattern. She'll be confused, because it's more common in children than adults. And then she'll order an MRI, because it's likely to get worse. - Why didn't you just say that? - Because... There... there's just so much more to this. Then give me a hint. Give me something. I mean, technically, I... I'm still your social worker. - I can make you go to the hospital. - Okay, what's the date today? The 13th? There will be a small commuter plane crash in Oregon around noon, with, uh, four casualties. If that doesn't happen, I will go to the hospital with you, okay? Fair? That's ridiculous. I mean, nobody can predict that. Well, then you'll get what you want, and I will go to the doctor with you. Do we have a deal? No. I also want your cell number. I don't have one. You don't have a cell? Fine, yours is a secret. Here, take this. I bought it as a gift for somebody that I used to... You know, it doesn't matter. Take it. If it rings, it's me. Please answer. Welcome to the 21st. I'm Traveler 3569. Oh, shit. - What do you think, boss? - Of what? Our operations base? Yeah, it's breathtaking. You're sure there hasn't been a messenger? I think a pre-adolescent kid might stand out. I thought this was gonna be a simple hand-off. The director probably didn't know about the pills. What pills? A fatal dose of fentanyl. Probably a failsafe in case he lacked the courage to pull the trigger. The director missed it. Cause of death on historical record is gunshot to the head. And there wasn't anyone from his team there to meet him? No. And we looked around. Let's not panic. The director will be aware that a traveler didn't make it and assign a new candidate. Yeah, if one comes available in time. You've memorized all the potential candidates in the area? I've memorized everything. Okay. Show off a little. How many since 0830? Hmm. Today's not a real good day. There's a construction worker that gets electrocuted early this morning. Prime host, actually. But the accident's impossible for the incoming traveler to avoid, so... Report of the construction worker's death this morning is already online. In a couple hours, there's an elective surgery that goes bad. The point is, it could take time. How much do we have? Thirty hours, give or take. We should drive the antimatter out of town, like the military was trying to do. No. No, the director must have some sort of plan for it. Probably as a power source. We need to make it possible for the other team to find us. I could throw out something like an SOS on the Deep Web. That would risk exposure from the FBI. - You know all about that. - Try your SOS. I can run interference at the bureau if I have to. And we could look at a way to extend the life of the unit with a supplemental power supply. Buy some time. Good. I'm gonna talk to the traveler that delivered it to us last night. You sure that's a good idea? No. Delaney. This is Major Gleason. I guess you've been expecting my call. Actually, I was hoping never to hear from you again. How's the circle jerk going? - We never had the material, did we? - What are you talking about? You're the one who drove away with it last night. Yeah, well, I thought so, too. Why aren't you off on an island somewhere exploding bombs? Well, there was an explosion, just not the one we were expecting. Oh, God. When? On our way to the base. How many casualties? The blast was substantial enough to put my driver into a coma, but we both know it should have been in the megaton range. - This didn't even make the news. - I'm not sure what you're accusing me of... It never existed, or somehow you hung on to it. Either way, we are going to have a conversation. - I'm just down here. See you later. - See you later. - Bye, sweetie. - Call me later. Bye. See you guys soon. Hey. Protocol 6, Agent MacLaren. Can't Officer Boyd and Special Agent MacLaren have a conversation? Okay, well, first of all, don't refer to yourself in the third person. Is this FBI business? In the sense that they wouldn't want an antimatter explosion in the middle of town. Are you serious? Have you been sent a messenger? Are you authorized by the director to talk to me? Then step away. Well, look, the arriving traveler we were meeting was DOA. In the absence of a clear course of action, you await instruction from the director via messenger or traveler. What else do you want me to tell you? How about the location of the team that we were supposed to hand off to? I don't know, and I'm not supposed to know. Look, you're new. I get it. I really do. And you got a bitch of a first assignment. But I've been here a year, and shit happens, okay? There's a reason we're so compartmentalized, MacLaren. There's teams of us all over the world on missions, and that's why... - That is why there's a Protocol 6. - Yeah. Yeah, I get the rules, but... but help me out here. Should we drive it to an unpopulated area, or leave it where it is and risk wiping out a city? It's a tough call. Get it right, please. Aviation authorities agree if it were not for the skill of the pilot, this tragedy could have been much worse. With just four dead, local authorities are grateful the pilot managed to bring the commuter plane down in a remote area. Names of the dead have not yet been released pending notification of the families... You all right? You're sweating. I'd like it if there was no bomb in my house, but otherwise... Philip. I think we are ready to do this. You got a cell phone? - Yeah. - Who could be calling you? It is my social worker. Yes? How could you have possibly, possibly known that was gonna happen unless you had something to do with it happening? I can't tell you that. Marcy, this is crazy. We made a deal that if it happened, I wouldn't have to go to the hospital with you today. Yes... but I didn't expect this. Yeah, well, it happened. You asked for a hint, I gave you one. - Look, I really need to go. - No, wait. Just one more question. This FBI business? Is it dangerous? Well, that depends on... Marcy, what's happening? - What happened? - His... his hands just started shaking. I think he shorted out the circuit. - He's in cardiac arrest. - Marcy... Go grab my bag. Marcy? Marcy? Come on. Philip... stay with us. Marcy? - Come on. - Marcy? Come on... Come on. He's back. Speak up, Trevor. Well, we didn't add time. We lost it, and there's not much left. I don't know what happened. It was like a tremor. My hand just jumped from the connectors. Shorting out our supplemental power supply and draining the unit's capacitor. - I am so sorry, guys. - Can you start over? Not in the few hours we have. What did you get out of Boyd? Only that I was in gross violation of Protocol 6, and we should solve our own problems. I think the solution now is to get that thing at a safe distance. Carly, if that's what the director wanted us to do, wouldn't he have sent a messenger by now telling us to do it? Which means there's another solution we haven't thought of. Yeah, one that we will think of in the next five hours. If we're down to hours, then there's no safe place for the antimatter other than far away. Yes, there is. And it's obvious. Where it was created. Delaney's lab? - That's insane. - Is it? I mean, the whole facility was designed to store antimatter for an unlimited amount of time. And it's a half hour away in traffic. I'm sure the team we were supposed to hand this off to must have had other plans. Well, no plan survives contact with the past. Can you find us a map of the Van Huizen compound on this antique? Okay, one, this equipment is currently state of the art. And two, wouldn't you rather I just hack into their main computer system? Oh. Yes, please. Okay, I don't want to shoot a hole in our only idea here, but... How do we do this without Delaney knowing we did it? I'm already in violation of Protocol 6 today. - Maybe I should just tell her. - Oh, no. What is it? The school called my mom. I missed a science test yesterday. I'm in. I could shut down the security system. I can probably shut down their power. But what might be most useful is a flood in the high-pressure water coolant supply of building 26. What do you think? For fuck's sake. Okay. See you, Jason. - Your friend is determined. - Yeah. There. He gave up. What exactly does a librarian need with a social worker? My host's identity was fiction. The product of a character-building exercise in social media, and which, in her case, was our primary source of information. In reality, Marcy... is a mentally-challenged woman living in the care of the state. How is that not a giant problem? Long term, it's most certainly fatal. I mean, not today or the next day. I plan on telling MacLaren once I've properly diagnosed myself. I just need somebody to know in case I have another seizure. We all have our burdens. Yours is no easier. I'm a doctor. I know the symptoms. - I'm dealing with it. - Hmm. Well, I want you to dose before we go. To keep your hands from shaking. Today is not the day you want to quit. You know, I'm not crazy about the idea of getting in bed with a mass murderer. Who? Delaney? You're forgetting we changed history. It never happened. She still created the most destructive weapon in history. If the military hadn't taken it farther away... That's their horseshit story. Delaney was a scapegoat. It was their own containment unit that failed. History just bought into their version of the story. I've seen her in those old history docs. The woman's got all the charm of a foaming yeast vat. Turn left up here. Hey. How's your day going so far? We've got, uh, something about flooding in building 26. - IDs please? - Sure. Fourteen gallons of water per minute. Tick tock. Go ahead. Afternoon, sir. I'm with FTRA. - Go ahead. - Okay, then. Okay, guys, I've hacked into the security systems. No workers where we want to be. All right, keep your eyes and your come open. Come on. It looks like the interface is up top. You stay right where you are. Shit. South door. Go. I already shut off the relief valve that had been opened remotely, so you don't need to bother going through the motions. So... Major Dickless didn't have the balls to do this himself? If you mean Major Gleason, who took your antimatter last night, no. In fact, we're the ones who took it from him. The material's in that black bag on my associate's shoulder. In a bag that size? No. It is pretty heavy. My other associate has a 9mm aimed at your back. Marcy, would you just aim the laser guide of your weapon at me for a second? We stopped a disaster last night, and to prevent another one, we need to get this material back where it belongs. Who the fuck are you people? My name is MacLaren. I'm with the FBI. My team has been tasked at the highest level to prevent the military from building the most powerful weapon of mass destruction in history. The teenager is FBI? Just me. They're specialists. Show me your credentials. We prevented the deaths of thousands of people last night, not to mention an arms race. But our portable containment unit has a limited battery capacity. Show it to me. Yeah. Is it supposed to be flashing like that? We don't have much time. We need to transfer it now. How could you possibly create a stable magnetic bottle inside something so small? Somebody's here. It's one vehicle, and the driver's alone. - Military. - Copy. Take no action. A vehicle's just pulled up outside. It's Gleason. I thought he sent you people to steal my research. How much time do we have? It's not like there's a clock on the thing. Minutes. There won't be a warning. It'll just go boom. You need to get rid of him as quickly as possible. That's all I ever do with him. Come on. Where's your staff? We had a small coolant leak. I sent everyone home while these people clean up. Can you guys be somewhere else for a few minutes? You're fine. Go back to work. They don't give a shit what we have to say, and frankly, I'm a little afraid to be alone with you. That's funny, I feel the same way. Go see for yourself that it's not here, so you can leave. We don't have time for this. Not yet. All right. So... if I never had it, and it's not here, then the only other possibility... What is that sound? I lied. It never existed. Material seemed to be accumulating, but with each new anti-particle we created, there were quantum micro-annihilations that went unrecorded. We have to take him out. I said wait. I didn't want to lose our funding, and thought we were making progress, but at best... We don't have time for this. You drove off with a milligram. I know how hard that must have been for you to confess. And on that level, I must admit I enjoyed that a little. But I do believe you were close, and we want you to continue your work. But that means you won't be rid of me for a while. Can I at least be rid of you now? Of course. Major Dickless is leaving. Is the containment unit powered up to 120 MeV? We left it fully charged in case the transfer wasn't 100%. - How long is this going to take? - I don't know. Done. It's back. Huh. Kinda thought that'd be a bigger deal. Nope. Empty. 10.3 grams of antimatter. Perfectly stable. How close did we come? I already told you, there's no way of knowing. It was pretty close, though. Doctor, I can't emphasize enough how important... FBI, my ass. Who are you people? Blondie over there can't be much over 20, and the technology Beefcake carried in on his shoulder doesn't exist. Well, obviously, it does. Look, all you need to know at this point is that I am with the bureau, the task force is top secret, and this won't be the last you hear from us. Just keep the material safe for now. For now? What does that mean? As in out of the hands of the military and off the front page of the paper. Look... if you need to reach me, or you want our help, there's my number. But I'll probably be calling you first. I'll hold my breath. By the way... we were this close to intervening. You just saved his life. Who? Gleason? Oh, great. That makes my day. Did you get my text? Yeah. Sorry, uh... I got busy. Well, the doctors did say you'd get back to your old self. Just making some tea. Do you want some? Please. So... did you save him? Hmm? I only ask because I heard you administering CPR to someone named Philip, who apparently had cardiac arrest, uh, before the phone went dead, and then, uh, you didn't answer for the rest of the day. Yeah, he's... he's fine. Oh, good. Good. So, what's on the agenda for tomorrow? Uh... I was thinking about what you said, and tomorrow I'm gonna go to the hospital. Do you want me to take you, or... do you wanna rappel down a rope from a helicopter? No, I would like you to take me. Please. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Okay. Oh, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. I know. I know. I know. Okay. I'm home. What? My husband actually home for the evening? No... - Hi! - Hi. Hi. What are you... This is a nice surprise. Mmm. Oh. You get that. I'll go pour us a glass of wine. - Hello. - Traveler 3468. Mission outcome acceptable in light of extenuating factors. Further breach of protocols may result in punitive action. End of message. Who are you? I'm the guy you're gonna sell those cookies to, I think. Sweetheart, I bought two boxes from you half an hour ago. You've already done this side of the street. Okay, bye. Both of which you're gonna take to the office with you tomorrow. If they stay in this house, I'll eat 'em all. If you insist. So... how was your day? You know what? My day was boring. I'd rather hear about yours. Tell me everything.
