 I'm starting to think whoever they're buying from ain't gonna show. It's all about patience. That's what you said in the Jonas Walker case... and he fell off the face of the Earth. You'll have to let that one go, partner. Yeah, I know, I know. I'm like a dog with a bone, I guess. Hello. What are they selling, car parts? Looks good.

 That's a hell of a lot of money for car parts. Multiple shots fired! 65 Heward Drive. We need backup right away! - What about the backup? - Can't wait! - FBI! - Drop your weapons! No! Drop your weapons! All responding units, be advised, there's a damaged Mercedes leaving this location with three armed men, two of them badly injured. Intercept and detain if possible! Traveler... 3468. Support required. 47 degrees, 14 minutes,

 35.045 seconds. Make and model confirmed. Units are en route. 07 seconds. End of message. You wait for the backup. I'm going after them! It's a damn mess. Philip, you there? Hey, boss. What are you doing right now? Oh, you know... healing from a gunshot wound, watching old news with Marcy. I need you to direct me to 47 degrees, 14 minutes, 35.045 seconds by 122 degrees, 22 minutes, 13.407 seconds. - You got it? - On it. Why? What... What's happening? I just got the most bizarre messenger. They're all bizarre to me. No. This message came from the mouth of a dying man. A traveler team in need of assistance at those coordinates. It's on its way to you now. We'll meet you there. Uh, nope. Philip's not going anywhere in his shape, but I will be there in 10. Pick up Carly on the way. Come armed. Bring your full medical kit. You're at the coordinates. Should be an old warehouse on your left. How far out are Carly and Marcy? Uh, five minutes. Make sure they wait for my all clear. Understood. Drop your weapon. - I'm here to help. - Shut up. He's one of the FBI agents. Yeah. Who you shot at. Thanks very much. Whatever happened to Protocol 3? I'm Traveler 3468. I received a message to come to these coordinates and give support. Who delivered the message? One of the Russians. Well, that's bullshit, 'cause that would kill an adult. It did. The director must've figured he was dying anyway. You want my help or not? I'm Rick Hall. This is Carter. That's my boy Luca on the table. Grant MacLaren. My medic's on the way. Well, that's good, 'cause ours is dead. What is this? What happened? Well, our mission was to acquire a component from Russian travelers and deliver it to another team for testing. The Russians' historian was dead, so they were out of cash. We were then instructed to finance them in exchange for the handoff, but they got greedy. A traveler team turned on you? He must be new. Yeah. They went rogue. Tried to take our money and the component, probably sell it somewhere else, and busted it in the process. You saw the rest. Now where's the medic? Carly, Marcy, you have the all clear to enter the building upon arrival. One minute out. They're moments away. So how badly damaged is it? I don't know. It's not my expertise. It was a good plan, if the Russians hadn't gone rogue. Yeah, then the FBI would've busted you. Doesn't sound like a great plan to me. Oh, shit. We're coming in. It's all right. What can you tell me? Gunshot wound to the abdomen. There's no exit wound. This is Luca. That's Carter. I'm Hall. Mr. Hall is their team leader. You can put your weapon away now. He's lost a lot of blood and he's still hemorrhaging. I think the only thing I can do is get him stable before we get him to a hospital. No. No hospitals. He's wanted by the police. They both are. Well, I don't have anywhere near the proper resources. Well, obviously, the director thinks you do, or you wouldn't be here, would ya? All right. Go ahead and put him out. Can you get me light, please? All right. All right. Okay, warm up the laser and get him on plasma. What happened? - He got shot in the gut. - No, I'm talking about you. Let me see. Ah! God damn it! I don't think that you understand how serious your injuries are. Stop worrying about me and help Luca. It's Forbes. Do your thing. MacLaren. We've got three dead bodies. All of them ghosts in the system. Really? Any word on the whereabouts of that car that I was pursuing? That's what I'm calling you to ask. No, no. They had too big a lead, and I was just about to get back to local enforcement. All right. Let me know what you hear. Will do. I can't locate the bullet. I think the only thing that I can do is cauterize the torn... Just get the bullet out of him. I am telling you that if I operate now, I will kill him. Your friend Carter is coughing up blood because his internal bleeding includes his lungs. I'm telling you that he's dying, he can't be saved. Fuck off! The man is an ox! Shut up and listen to me! Okay? This is time-sensitive. Luca has lost close to 40% of his blood. He won't survive any sort of surgery without a donor. So if we act now, we can use Carter's blood to save Luca's life. I have a blood-type converter. I'm telling you I can't save them both. So we either watch the two of them die, or Carter saves Luca's life. Those are your options. You need to decide before Carter goes septic and his blood's not good to anyone. - Mr. Hall... - I hear you. Relax. I just... Just give me a second, please. I have to make sure the FBI doesn't show up here. If I don't do something to throw Forbes off... Do what you need to do. I'll be operating into the early hours. Carly can assist. Mr. Hall can handle anything that comes up. All right. Looking good, Trev. How's it feel? I feel great. - Yeah? - Yeah. Let's see what else you got in the tank! Wow. Man, you're flying! Back on the team in no time. Trevor. Can I talk to you? Ms. Day? How can I help you? Actually, I would like to help you. I've been looking over your transcripts, and there's some things we need to talk about. What is it? Well, it's kind of a bigger conversation that I'd like to have with you and your parents. You know, the whole team. I like to think that I can have these conversations on my own. Well, you're 17, so... I've set a meeting with them for fourth period today. I'll expect to see you there. I'll be there. - All right. - Hey! A little help? Let's see if you've still got it! What are you doing here? No, "Hey, Jeff"? No, "Good morning"? I get, "What are you doing here?" Looks like my son spent another night at the babysitter while you're out with your new man, hmm? Think I haven't seen that white dude around? Is that how you got these new wheels? You got a sugar daddy? That's none of your business. Carly. We gotta talk about this family. We're not a family. Mother, father, and son. Mother, son, abusive biological father. - That's cold. - It's accurate. So you're gonna throw away everything that's good between us because one night I had a bit too much to drink? - Hmm? - I'm leaving now. Carly, come on. Come on. You know we got a connection, right? You gonna tell me you don't miss this? - Don't, Jeff. - I do. Ow! What the... This... is where any idea you have of us ends. Right now. You do not touch me. Are we clear? I still got a right to see my kid. And your kid has a right to child support. Don't come near us again without it. You've changed, Carly. You're like... You're like a completely different person. It's something that should've happened a long time ago. Bitch. Bitch! Hey, kid? Hey. Got your drugs. Why don't you knock next time? Why don't you lock the door? You're welcome, by the way. If you're smart, there's about three weeks' worth of Percs in there. Although, you know, uh, trading one addiction for another never works. Uh, you look, uh... not so good. Like somebody beat you up. Somebody beat you up? I'm fine. You don't look fine. You look like a piece of... Holy shit. What is this? It's nothing. It's insanity. Hey. It's the gambling matrix, right? This is how you do it, isn't it? It's really nothing. There are dates up here that are months from now. How much research do you... - No! Don't! - Don't. Why don't you give me a tip? Gimme a little tip. Come on. Can you just leave? Please? Either you give me a tip, or you tell me what this is all about on the wall over here. All right? 'Cause you got all of that, and you're giving me, like, crumbs. Come on, man. You'd be in jail right now if it wasn't for me. You know that. Hey, Luca, it's okay! Hey, hey, I'm right here. I'm right here. I need you to wake up. Listen to me. I need you to wake up, all right? Wake up, Luca. - Luca? Luca, wake up. - No. No. Get out! No! No! Wake up, Luca! Wake up! Ms. Warton. I'm Officer Conniker. I tried to contact you earlier. I'd just like to speak with you about the incident outside the library. What incident? The boys that assaulted you and another employee? Listen, I understand that you didn't report it, and that's not unusual with assault cases, but I... I saw the closed-circuit television footage. Caught both assaults and you kicking their asses. Not that you'd be in any trouble for retaliating. What I saw was actually... damn impressive. Well, I'd like to move on. Uh-huh. Listen, have you sought counseling of any kind? Everything's fine. I don't need counseling. So then why are you living with your social worker? Excuse me? Not that you're to blame in any way, but I should inform you that should a state mental health worker be found guilty of inappropriate fraternization with a client, especially one with developmental issues... Do I look like I have developmental issues, Officer? That's not for me to judge. I'm just saying that'd be grounds for termination. If not worse, litigation. Just so you understand the consequences. Are you gonna take that, or... Uh, yeah. If you'll excuse me. This is Marcy. What happened? He was fine when I left. Night terrors. Sometimes they're too real. Yeah, one minute he's sleeping, the next, he's screaming. He almost killed me once. Move. All right, well, let's get you closed up again. - Mac. We got 'em. - Got who? Our friends from last night. Located 'em right here in town. We had leads had them leaving the city. Yeah, I did some digging anyway. Ran the plates on the car that left the scene. Belongs to a Sergeant Rick Hall. Served in Iraq. Lives in Portland. Had some agents go check out his place this morning. Hall hasn't been there in weeks. Pulled him up on the database. He owns three other properties. Place in Austin, condo in Vancouver, and a warehouse right here in town. Checked out the freeway CCTV footage... and... Nice work. Let's, uh, file for a warrant and get down there, huh? Already got it. Suit up. Right. I'll meet you downstairs in a minute. All right. Marcy, it's MacLaren. I don't know, man. I just got word from MacLaren. The FBI are on their way. We have maybe 20 minutes. Isn't MacLaren with the FBI? Yeah, and he obfuscated the best he could. But his partner found your name on the deed to this building and tracked your vehicle here. Okay, well, you... you tell him he's gotta stop them. There's only so much he can do without blowing his cover. We're wasting time. Are you being serious right now? Are you kidding me? What about us? Luca shouldn't even be moved! I will be there! I'm okay. We should go. They're on their way. We need to move. What I'd like to do is change the conversation from Trevor's football career and focus on his grades. If he has the football career, he doesn't need grades. Tabling that for a moment, I think it's important for you to understand that Trevor needs to start doing much better... Trevor, we need you outside the school and ready to go in three minutes. We've got a mission. Are you prepared to do the work? - I can do that. - Good. Carly will be outside to pick you up. On his homework and less watching Internet porn. - Understood. No more porn. - What? Don't wanna embarrass the kid. Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, Gary. Ms. Day? I know you probably have a lot you wanna talk about without me in the room. So, I should give you a chance to do that. All I have to say is that I fully intend to raise my grades, and focus on the sciences, and that I have no intention of playing football again. - What? - Sorry, Gary. Gary? Thank you for your time and concern. Wait, Trevor, we're not finished here. - Trevor! - You're playing football! I'm sorry. He's just been so different since the concussion. Can I have one of those? Do you think you can sit up for me? Come on. All right. There you go. Okay. I need you to hold this bag above your heart, okay? All right. Is that Carter? He saved your life. Above your heart, okay? Nice and easy. The wound is fragile. All right. It's time. We gotta go. Okay. Reminder, these men are dangerous. Approach with extreme caution. Breathe, man. You used to love this shit in the old days. I wasn't very bright in the old days. Fall back! Fall back! You okay? You should've warned us. Come on. You would have told them. MacLaren had to be as surprised as the rest. Don't worry about it. They're fine. But they could be hurt. It had to be done! We would've left too much back there... Jesus, what is that? Is that a baby? Whose baby's that? - Mine. - You take him on missions? Oh, not if I can help it, but somebody needed to come save your ass. He has your eyes, Carly. He really does. I just hope we can fix it. It's a key component. Tell me this kid knows what he's doing? This kid is older than all of us put together. What the fuck was that? You nearly killed my men! They're not your men. Do you even give a damn about Protocol 3? - Was anybody killed? - You nearly killed me, Hall! Yet here you are, MacLaren! Look, if you had done your job properly, the FBI wouldn't have found us in the first place. I can only throw them off the scent for so long! Forbes is a good cop. Well, maybe I should've waited for your friend Forbes to open the door - before I set it off. - What? It was our base of operations. I had to get rid of the evidence! - You almost got... - Okay! Okay, okay. It's done. You're alive. Yeah. Have you slept? You look exhausted. I am, but I'll live. So will my patient. - It's not an easy fix. - But we can do it. - Well, you damn well better. - Don't talk to my team like that! Or what? What're you gonna do? Okay! All right! All right! Hey! They just need some time to work. Let's give them some space. What is it? I'm grounded. You know, I was tempted to break his nose on your behalf, but... I held it together. You and me both. I don't know, the director obviously thinks he and his team are worth saving, but I... I gotta get back to work. This bomb isn't exactly gonna de-escalate the investigation. I gotta call my babysitter. Hey. Can I get on our computer? Uh... Is there something I can... I'll do it, just get me on. I need to set dropoff coordinates with the other team, if that's okay with you. - Be my guest. - Well, thank you so much. How you feeling, Luca? Better. Thanks. Hey, uh, how long have you had night terrors? Since I was a kid. I know it's hard for some people to understand. No. I do. My brother used to get them all the time growing up. - Your brother? - Mmm-hmm. Uh, get some rest, okay? Yeah. Hey. - Can I talk to you for a second? - About what? Well, when I was really young, there was an emergency evacuation in my shelter block. - I was separated from my brother... - So? So... one of the things that I remember about him is he used to suffer from night terrors. I just thought, there's only so many of us... Leave the future in the past, Doctor. Protocol 2. I understand that, but if it's at all possible... I don't think you understand. I don't think you understand a goddamn thing. I don't think any of you do! Look. We came here with a team of five, just like you. You know, we all made it. Which is rarer than you think, believe it or not, but we're down to two now. What does that mean to you? Uh... two more to go? When you have been doing this as long as we have, doing whatever the director tells you, without question, building devices for missions, rigging elections, saving people... and, by the way, killing people, too. Don't think the future doesn't get its hands dirty. To do this job, to stay alive, you need to be focused. We're very focused, Mr. Hall. Focused? You're a bunch of fucking tourists! He's a junkie. Don't think I haven't seen fresh track marks before. You're worried about your parents grounding you, for Christ's sake! Your tactician brings an infant to the missions, and MacLaren... MacLaren doesn't even know what side he's on! Well, I thought we were all supposed to be on the same side. I need you to be committed to the mission, whatever the mission! Protocol 1 is the only one that matters, and that's what you guys aren't getting. And you're not getting that because your priorities are all outta fuckin' whack! Now, I need this team, right here, right now, to get on side, or I cannot trust you. Is there a problem? - No! - Yes! Mr. Hall here doesn't seem to think we know what we're doing. I'm just trying to help your people understand how things are around here. Oh, we understand how it is, Mr. Hall. We really do. I hope so. Knock knock? Kat. You really are here. Well, yeah, I... I texted you. Yes, you did. How romantic. Since this is usually date night, I thought I'd bring you some Chinese and make you take a break. Don't worry, it's vegetarian. Well, that is romantic. Mmm. I'm sorry about tonight. I... I know it's been crazy busy. - I just... We don't have enough manpower. - Oh, come on. I am happy to share you with your work, babe. I always have been. As long as that's all I'm competing with. What does that mean? Well, it has been an awfully long time. Yeah, I know. - Hey. - Hey. You still look like shit. Thanks. Who's that you're with? A friend. Well, it looks like a cop car. Yeah, it does a little, doesn't it? So which one is it? Right here. That's great. Thanks for doing this. Yeah. - Keys? - Oh... Where's my money? I transferred your money. Yeah, you transferred me the rent. Now you owe me 8% commission. 8% what? And, uh, bets for tomorrow? I gave you bets yesterday. Yeah, uh... I got a little ambitious. I can't keep doing this, Ray. Well, I can't keep being your errand boy. Come on, bud. Show me a little respect. Look at everything I do for you on a daily basis. I bring you drugs. I show you houses. You don't even tell me your system. Okay, 10%. 10%. What's that work out to be? Just give me the keys. Who's this house for, anyway? It's a safe house for time travelers. Them again, huh? All right. It's better I don't know. Here you go. You know, in a way, I'm kind of glad this happened. Glad you got shot? Why? Well, believe it or not, I'm the last member of the team to take a hit. Everyone else has taken at least one bullet for the director. I was starting to feel like maybe I wasn't pulling my weight or something. Well, I've, uh, got the impression Hall likes to make everyone feel that way. Ah, he might have a harsh style of leadership, but... I'd do anything for that man. Your host have a family? Sort of. Not really. She had, um... David. His name is David. He took care of my host before I arrived. What? Like a butler? Your host rich? No, she just needed assistance with some things. What about you? Wife? Kids? That should do it. - Looks different. - It'll work. Hall, we found you a safe house. It's time to go. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out. What happened to "we're all on the same side"? I don't wanna be in the same room. Listen, we're all gonna get along. You'll see. - Where's Luca and Marcy? - They went for a walk. Marcy said that he had to keep moving to prevent clotting. Okay. Soon as they get back. Are you sure that's the director's intention? 'Cause I'm just... I'm just asking a question. Have you received instructions from the director to relocate my team? No, I haven't. Okay. Well, the director put us together for a reason. You're splitting us up, why? Protocol 6. Maybe... Oh, listen to the boy scout quoting his protocols. I know the rules, MacLaren. "Traveler teams should stay apart unless instructed otherwise." Well, guess what? You were instructed otherwise. I think you know that I have seniority here. I should be leading this team. MacLaren. We ID'd all the bodies now. Counting the Russians and the guy we found scorched in the warehouse, that's four. That leaves two still out there. One of them's this Rick Hall character. Who's the other one? The system just pulled him up on a ABM camera in the east end. I'll send a picture to your phone. Guy's name is Luca Shun. We got him working 15 years as a sous chef in Portland. Then all of a sudden he's wanted upstate for petty theft and assault charges. I'm following a lead on Hall. - I'll let you know what I find. - A'ight. Agent Forbes? I told you he was a good cop. Marcy, I need you and Luca inside now. Marcy? She may have turned off her com. I'll try and find them. - I'll look around the neighborhood. - You stay put. - You're just as wanted as Luca. - Hey. We're right here. Hey. - What's wrong? - The FBI caught you on CCTV, knows who you are, and are searching the area. Yeah, if only we had somebody on the inside. There is no way I'm risking my team getting discovered. I want you out of here. The mission comes first. You said it was a simple handoff of a component, so hand it off and get out of state. You know, there's a simple answer to this problem. He needs to go. - Who needs to go? - Go where? Forbes! He knows too much. He's too close. We remove him, we don't gotta go anywhere. We are not killing Forbes. Well, if you can't do it, I know people who can, but it's obvious to me the director's put us together for a reason, so I can teach you a lesson. Now, if it's too much for you to handle, I can help you. But I think it would be better for all of us to see if you have it in you. So... Do we... Do we have a problem? No. Do you deny my seniority? - I don't deny it. - Of course not. You're the kind of man who follows the rules. This is great, right? Luca and I can handle our dropoff tonight while you deal with Forbes. I'm gonna take your vehicle. - I'll rent you a car. - Whatever. As long as you remember to bring it back with a full tank of gas. Cracks me up. I love this guy. Here's the thing. When we're both done, we are gonna have a conversation about how this new team will work together. - Forbes. - Hey, it's Mac. You got something? Yeah, maybe. We should meet. I'll text you the location and the broad strokes, but we should go over the details in person. Say an hour? Yeah, I can do that. You all right? Never better. See you in an hour. We're all set. Nobody said this was gonna be easy. I know. But I never thought we'd have to do something like this. Just think of how MacLaren feels. He's the one who has to do it. He doesn't have to do anything. The director didn't order it. How confident are you in the intel? This is the place. Come on. Your new doctor thinks she's your sister. Yeah. She told me. I hope she's right. Well, you should get that thought out of your head right now. Your loyalty needs to be with me. You know you have it. - Not so sure of MacLaren. - Oh, don't worry about MacLaren. I know what kind of guy he is. He'll fall in line. And if he doesn't? Then he'll have to go. FBI! Hands! Show me your hands! Son of a bitch. Get out. Sergeant Richard Hall, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one... Search the car. North and south are clear. Sorry for the change in location. What happened to the other team? They apparently had complications. We were instructed to take over. Here it is. It was damaged... but we did our best to repair it. So long as it works. Helios isn't far away. Wasn't anything in the car. No? It's cool. We got plenty on 'em to put 'em away. Just makes me wonder... what were they doing out here? Well, how about I ask 'em in the morning? That works for me. Great work, partner. You, too. Hey, guys. I know it's late. I just wanted to touch base about what we did tonight. The last thing I ever thought I'd do is turn on a fellow traveler... but I really don't think we had any other choice. I guess we'll find out soon enough if the director agrees. Anyway... I just wanted to say thanks for sticking by me. Get some rest. Can you stay? I shouldn't. Okay. Tell me we did the right thing. I believe we did. But I guess we'll see. Yeah. We'll see.
