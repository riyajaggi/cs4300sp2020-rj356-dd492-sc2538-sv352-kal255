 {\be27}Extracted by\N{\c&H562CD0;&}ll sCarLet ll{\c}\N{\c&HC48338;&}@wahab_94{\c}. Come on, old lady. Let's go. Don't call me that. Why not? It's true, so get used to it. The fact that my brother became a dad doesn't make me an old lady. - What's this? - What is it? A gift? For me? Do you see any other old ladies here? Well?

 It's a bee. What? No, it's a butterfly. I see. A butterfly, okay. It's unique. You don't like it? Of course, I do! I mean, it's... original. Original? I... I thought it would suit you. No, it's cool. Really cool. Fine. It's hideous.

 I'm so sorry. - I tried. - Thanks, sweetie. Can you help me put it on? Sure. I don't know why you see it as a bee. It's a butterfly. It's a butterfly. - Okay. - Right? YAEL ASHKENAZI FAREWELL, I HAVE LIVED AMONG YOU LIKE A WILDFLOWER I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't mean to push you... I didn't call you over to a cemetery at 7:00 a.m. for an apology. I thought it was your way of getting back at me. Benda sent it to me. Last night. Are you still doubtful? How could she still be alive? I don't know. - But I'm going to find out. - What do you mean? I'm flying out there. I'm not staying here for another minute. - You're welcome to join me. - Hold on, Aviv. I need time to take this all in and discuss it with my mom. Do whatever you want. There's a flight to Bogota today at 4:00 p.m. I'm going to be on that flight. WHEN HEROES FLY THE SERIES IS BASED ON THE BOOK WHEN HEROES FLY BY AMIR GUTFREUND. MISSING Sir, have you seen this girl? Have you seen this woman? - Yes? - Benda, where are you? I'm still in the city center. What? But you said you'll be here before noon. The place is packed. I'm sorry, honey, I still have a lot to do. Maria. You could have done that later. Sweetie, I'll finish in an hour, and I'll be there, okay? - Don't worry, everything is okay. - You know what? - Do whatever you want, I got to go. - Okay, bye. - Crazy Israeli, what's up? - What? - Shouldn't you greet me? - I don't know you. Move. - You don't know me? - Let go of me! Just admit that you recognize me. You're offending me. I don't know who you are. Let go of me! Hey, what are you going to do with that knife? I'm crazy like you said. I knew it was you. What? Did I wake you up? I'm at the office. Is it urgent? Dubi? I just met with Aviv. Aviv again? Himmler, I saw a photo of her. A photo of Yaeli. A photo? What photo? I don't know what to tell you. What if we were wrong? What if we made a mistake? I think she's alive. Himmler? What? In any case, I'm... I'm flying to Bogota with Aviv. - I'm coming along. - No, Himmler, forget it. - I don't think you should come. - I'm not asking for your permission. With this thing as crazy as it is, I don't think you and Aviv should... Dubi, I know she's your sister. But as you remember, it's not just your business. I'm coming along, and Aviv will just have to deal with that. - Mazal tov! - Mazal tov! - May your new son bring you joy. - Thank you. Eat something, won't you? Don't tease me. I'm so hungry. I could bite your nose off. I just drove for three hours. Well, is the baby circumcised? - Did they name him yet? - Not yet. But don't get your hopes up. Nobody names their kid "Benda." What's with the fly? It's a bee. Butterfly. Oh, man. Daddy Dubi! How is it going? - Are you eating and drinking? - Eating and drinking. Enjoy it, man. But save some for Yaeli's grandma. Quit checking out my plate and let me enjoy myself! Our parents just arrived. You okay? - Do you know that Himmler is here? - What? Do you know that Himmler is here? Yes. Have you greeted him? Do I have to? - You're acting like a five-year-old. - Whatever. - I think he would be happy if you said hi. - Drop it, Dubi. He's not doing well. What do you mean? He has cancer. What? - Cancer. - Cancer? - How did you know? - He told me. Go say hi to him, Aviv. Cancer? But he's smoking like a chimney. He already has cancer anyway. You guys should talk. - Where are you off to? - I need to use the bathroom. I'll go make sure the circumciser doesn't drink too much. Hi, Mom. Look at yourself. You should dress properly. If you don't care about your own dignity, do it out of respect for your father. Did you know about this? Of course not, man. You think I won't tell you if I did? This is so fucked up. Are you surprised? He's European. He keeps everything bottled inside. - As if you're any better. - What do you mean? Going to trance parties, doing drugs... - Get off my case, Aviv. - Benda, don't fuck with me, man. You take ecstasy every weekend like it's chewing gum. Who knows what else you do? I'm here for you, man. You're not alone. - "You're not alone"? - Yes. Seriously, Aviv? You've got Yaeli. You've got your club. Dubi started to spawn kids, and Himmler has more important things to deal with than me, okay? So don't say nonsense like "you're not alone" to me. What about you? Do you sleep well? Dubi, I think you should talk to your mom. I can't talk to her about this before I myself understand what's going on. - Aviv? - What? Aviv, hold on. Shouldn't you go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs first? - I'm not staying here any longer. - So you're just going to go there alone? What will you do once you get there? I'm not going alone, Dubi is coming too, okay? You're not getting carried away because of Aviv, right? - Is that what you think? - Dubi, we buried Yaeli. - It's impossible that she's alive. - Did you see the photo? If there's even a slight chance, I've got to do it. Right. - She's my sister. - Right. It has been ten years since you have left the city, and you're just going to pack up and go? Mom, listen to me carefully. I know you're worried, I get it. But I'm not staying here when there's a chance that Yaeli is alive. I understand, but it's totally insane. You know that there are other people whose job is to do this, right? What other people, Mom? We're talking about Yaeli here! Here. You forgot your prayer pouch. And I bought you some canned food, tuna, corn, so that you can keep kosher. Thanks. I've decided to do this. Please give me some money. Don't stop me. Don't stop me. I'll rob a kiosk if I have to! You know me! I'm not kidding. Please. But do me a favor. Please, I beg you. Promise me... - Promise me you'll take care of yourself. - Thank you. Do you have one for me? - Since when did you smoke? - I don't. Do you have one for me? Put that shit out. - We have to get going anyway. - Hold on, Aviv. What? Look, there's something I haven't told you. What is it? Are you for real? What is he doing here? - He also wanted to come. - How does he know what's going on? I told him. - Why? - Why not? Is it a secret? I can't force him not to come, all right? And neither can you. It's his prerogative. What's up? Okay. - I told you, this is a bad idea. - Maybe for you and Aviv, it's a bad idea, but for me, it's not. Let's see if there are any business class seats left. - Don't start with that. - With what? Neither Aviv not I can afford business class tickets. - It will be my treat. - Forget it. If you come with us, you play by our rules. Excuse me, ma'am. I'm going to the restroom. You should go too before people line up. Aviv. I didn't tag along just to make trouble for you guys, okay? For Yaeli's sake, I think it's best if we're not upset with each other. Nobody is upset with you, Himmler. Then lighten up. To be honest, I don't get why you're tagging along. Dubi is still my friend, and Yaeli is his sister, that's why. Listen, we're all adults here, okay? I'm not faking it. I'm not pretending that everything is all right. We're here for an important cause. Cheers. What's up? What's up, boss? Looks like everything is going smoothly, doesn't it? How is the new guy? You gave him another chance. What is it with you? That big heart of yours will end up costing you your business. It will be fine. Sweetie, can you get me some water? Look at me. Aviv, look at me. Sir, please sit down. I need to use the restroom. I understand. But we're about to land. I heard you, but I need to use the restroom. Sir, you can't stand here. You must return to your seat. - Hey! We're waiting here! - What are you doing? That guy has been in there for 30 minutes. - Dude, come on. Get out! - What's your problem? Return to your seat now! What's going on, Himmler? I'm fine. But this bastard is hogging the restroom. - Who are you calling a bastard? - You, you bastard! - Enough! - Mind your language! - He's not feeling well. - He should watch it. - Are you his friend? - Yes. Go in, wash your face. Can I have some water? Sorry, thanks. I have to clean up here. What's up with you? I'm fine. It must be something I ate. Excuse me. What did he say? He said he will pick us up. I gave him the flight number. It's Benda. He lives in a whole other dimension. Come here, you bastard! Man, I missed you. Dubi! What's up? Wow. - Are you doing okay? - Yes. - And what are you doing here? - They had a good deal in the coach class. - How was the flight? - Smooth, except when Himmler threw up on the flight attendant. You always had a way with women, right? - Did you talk with the photographer? - Ricardo? I can't get hold of him, man. Let's go see him. Don't you want to dump your stuff at the hostel first? I booked two rooms. I didn't know you were coming, Himmler. It's all right. I'll just shack up with you in your mansion. No problem, man. I'll ask Maria. - Maria. - You bet, man. Let's get going. We're wasting time. Let's go. Dubi, lock the car. - Where is it? - Right here, man. Come on, Himmler. Hey, we're looking for your sister. But why does it look like he's running the show? Why does it matter who's running the show, Himmler? We all remember what happened last time Aviv was in charge. Dubi, with all due respect, you have the right to lead us. - It's your sister. - They were together for three years. - You can't ignore that. - I guess it was enough for him. How could you forgive him after the way he treated her? Who said I did? What were you guys talking about? Well, Dubi is concerned. He's wondering if Maria will convert to Judaism for you. - Can we go in now? - Sure. This way. There's someone inside. Tell him that we just want to talk. Ricardo, we just want to talk. Again. Ricardo, we just want to talk to you, man. Open the door. The son of a bitch is getting away! Himmler, come with me. Benda, stay there! Dubi, get him some water. I'm sorry, man. But yesterday, when you saw the photos, what were you trying to hide? Oh, man. - What did he say? - He wants to go there to visit. - Benda, have you ever heard of this cult? - No, man. My girlfriend that insisted I come here. I don't know what happened there. That night at the club. Perhaps there was something in my drink, something that didn't mix well. Aviv, did you go for therapy after the war? - Did you see a shrink? - No therapy. I was fine. I'm fine. How many hours of sleep did you get this past week? Look, Aviv, when you describe what you went through in Lebanon, I admit that I'm surprised you've managed to hold it all in until now. It was two years ago. I don't think it's related. Aviv, could you call Roee? He's been looking for you all week It's getting awkward to deal with him. He can't run the business on his own. He needs you down at the club. I have no strength. Are you familiar with the term PTSD? It stands for post-traumatic disorder. Let's go out for a walk. You'll feel better. The war ended two years ago. Let's get some fresh air, Aviv. And I'm not holding anything in. I repressed things, if that's what you mean. Our mind is quite mysterious. We never know how and when it will be triggered. There are no rules. I don't know what to do anymore. He won't talk to me. Look, Aviv. You've put up strong defenses. But they're all worn down now. You need help. Your body is crying out for help. You must listen to your body and help yourself. Welcome. "El Hummus de Benda." This is the place. Yes, take a seat. Now you see why that jackass lives here? And to think he was a virgin until he was drafted. Nothing. I tried every option. Not even in Spanish? No, nothing. Well? Did you find anything? No. - You think Ricardo was spouting lies? - It actually fits his description. If these people live in hiding, why would they show up on Google? I'm going to have a smoke. Hey, man. - What's up? - What's up? It's been ages since we've had hummus together, hasn't it? Man, I missed you, guys. What a nice place you've got here. Yes. Everything is going well. - Is it going well with Maria? - Maria? - Yes. - She's an angel, man. A godsend. - That's really great, man. - Yes. It's great to see you doing well. Thanks, buddy. What about Himmler and Dubi? You all seem to be getting along. This isn't a reunion, man. We're here to find Yaeli. We'll find her. I'm telling you. It's great to have you here. Let's fly abroad. What are those? I got us tickets to South America. Let's go there. It will better for us to stay there. I know it. Let's just take a breather and go there. I want you to go. Where? I need to be alone. Please leave. Where would I go? I have no idea. Go to your mom's place. I don't know. I just can't do this anymore. I want to be alone here. - You don't mean that. - I mean it, please leave. - You don't mean that. - I'm serious. Now, please, I'm asking you to leave. - I'm not leaving you. - I can't do this anymore. Is this really what you want? To live with a pill popper? I beg you, leave me alone and get out. This is my home. Fine. What are you doing? - What are you doing? Aviv! - I can't stay here. How many times must I say that I can't do this anymore? - Aviv, what are you doing? - I can't do this anymore. - I tried to explain it nicely. - Aviv. - I'm losing my mind. - Just look at me for a second... - Aviv... - Enough! Why are you doing this? I... Why are you doing this? Stop it. Come here. Come here. I can't take it anymore. I just can't take it anymore. I can't be with you. I can't be with you. I can't smell you, - I can't do this anymore. - Calm down, please. I can't take it anymore! I don't believe you. Enough. Look at me, it's me. - Look at me. - Yaeli! - Let me go. - No. - Let me go. - No. - Let me... - I don't want to. You're not going anywhere. - Yaeli. - Stop. Listen to me. I don't love you anymore. Aviv? Come inside. Benda just got a call from a woman who saw Yaeli. Hello. Hello. - Sofia? - Yes, we spoke on the phone. - Yes. - You posted those posters? Yes. - Nice to meet you, I'm Benda. - Have a seat. Let's take a seat, guys. - Can I get you guys something to drink? - No, just give us some water. - Water? - Yes. Is that why you all look so sad? Well, this girl, what is your relation to her? She's a good friend of ours, and this is her brother, Dubi. You said on the phone that she was here. Yes, four days ago. She was here four days ago. Do you speak English? Why would Yaeli care about toilet paper? - What? - The woman says that they looked anxious and that Yaeli looked like she wanted to say something. So why would she care about the toilet paper? Thank you very much, ma'am. Subtitle translation by Hagit Harel
