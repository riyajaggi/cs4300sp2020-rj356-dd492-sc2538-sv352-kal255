Welcome to Colombia. I expected a person like you to be more cautious. But I admit that it does make my job much easier. Look, I'm sure you did not plan to spend the next few years in prison, but given the evidence that I have here, even if your dad is the judge,

 you will be jailed for a long time. I won't lie to you. I'm not good at lying. I suggest that you cooperate, and I promise it will make things easier for you. I don't intend to talk to anyone, until I'm back in Israel. Well, you are in no position to make demands, I hope you realize that. You don't have that privilege. I came all the way here to see you, and I'm staying here until you talk to me. Fine, suit yourself. It's a beautiful city with many tourist attractions to see. You will have plenty of time.

 I really advise you to cooperate, Ronen. I don't think you realize how deep you are in trouble. I truly appreciate your concern. - You never told me your name. - Noga. {\an8}ISRAEL THE PREVIOUS WEEK. Yes. Noga is here. I'm leaving now. I'll call you back. All right. Bye. What's up, Noga? I'll never know how one gets the guts to kill one's self. How could this noose support his weight? What do we know about him? This is his girlfriend's house. Her name is Liah Abramov. Her family is filthy rich. They have a lot of money. It looks like he and his friends partied hard last night. Give me a glove. This is the third one. Can we officially consider these as related cases? What does his girlfriend say? She's in shock. She doesn't talk much. She just said he was talking nonsense last night, something about a white horse that wants to kill him. She thought he was drunk, so she ignored it. Then she woke up in the morning to this. - Guttmann. - What? Guttmann. "The White Horseman." You think the painting drove him crazy? It looks that way, does it not? Noga. We found this in the guy's bag. Thanks, Boaz. An ointment? Yaki! WHEN HEROES FLY He suffered. {\an8}THE SERIES IS BASED ON THE BOOK WHEN HEROES FLY. From what? His neck did not break. He died due to the blocked artery connecting the brain to the heart. It was an unpleasant death. Is any death pleasant? What about his blood work? It is the same as the first two cases. We found traces of entactogens, serotonin boosters like MDMA. I assume he did it to get high too. - It is like ecstasy. - This stuff is not ecstasy. Ecstasy makes you fall in love for the wrong person at most, not want to hang yourself. We are not familiar with this compound. We are still waiting for a test result from the lab in Germany. I have a feeling we will be learning about this material the hard way. Yes, the lesson has already begun. What's that? An insect bite scar. What kind of bite? I assume it's a reminder from an unpleasant encounter with a spider. I've seen it a lot in youngsters returning from trips abroad. Abroad? Usually South America. I need you to check the other two cases for me. I would not be surprised if they also visited South America. Would you mind telling me why I'm doing this? I have a lead. I need you to check it out. Noga. I have to go. I'll see you at the station, all right? All right. There have been three victims in the past couple of months alone, in addition to two others from March. All healthy, young males who just committed suicide one day. Sadly, I think we'll be posting more cases on this board. Do we know where that stuff is coming from? Interestingly, we discovered that three out of five victims visited South America in the past six months. I think some of them brought the drug to Israel or were exposed to it there. South America. Do we have any leads? An address... Look, the immediate suspects are Katzover and Shimoni, but we only have insubstantial evidence. We need more time. Well, we must release something to the press. The media is keeping a close watch on me. Also, in the social networking sites... Avi, we can't release unconfirmed information. If the police release a report stating that the drug comes from South America, we will get a surge of hikers returning to Israel with bagfuls of this stuff. All right. Contact the border police. I want to know about every drug dealer who flew there this year. I guess we will come across some familiar faces of guys who decided that now is the time for their post-army trip. - Are you all right? - What? Yes. I'm just throwing out my back. Look, if we see that all pieces of evidence point to Katzover, I will get you off the case. Otherwise, it will look bad. Is that the real reason, or do you think I won't be professional at work? It's a sensitive topic, Noga, you know that. Yes. By the way, why do they kill themselves? This drug is like ecstasy in disguise. It overflows you with love and then turns on you, causing severe hallucinations. - "Turns on you"? - It unleashes all your fears. It breaks down your walls. Sounds like a portal to hell. It's a good enough reason to hang yourself, right? Yes. Bye. What? Guess who decided to unwind in Colombia in the past few months? Katzover? Close. It turns out Moshiko Buaron discovered America. South America, to be exact. According to the border police, he left Israel 11 months ago. What else? There has been no documented re-entry. Buaron? In the drug scene? Like everyone else, he wanted to grow. He's an ambitious guy. Nobody "grows" in this garden without the gardener, Katzover's approval. Are you hungry? Do you want to go down to Katznelson Street? I heard Yoni Kantor opened a cell phone lab down there. Kantor and a sandwich? Sounds good. I'll go in from the back. Kantor! What's your problem, you bitch? Did you sleep well, Kantor? I bet you miss the beds in Abu Kabir prison. What do you know about this? What is that? I think you know. Is it some kind of facial cream? Yaki, smear some on his face. His skin looks kind of dry from here. Yes, I noticed that too, Kantor. - Am I right? - Yes. Go ahead. Perfect. Get that stuff away from me. Get away from me! - Relax, Kantor. It's just facial cream. - Get that away from me! I know that your cousin Moshiko Buaron is in South America now. What do you know about that? I don't know what you want from me. I have not seen or spoken to him since Passover dinner. You are a terrible liar, Kantor. I suggest you cooperate. What will you arrest me for? For being Moshiko's cousin? You have nothing on me. Send a patrol unit to 45 Lewinsky Street. - What is there? - Victor Kantor's spice shop. - Seriously? - Yes. - I can't just send a patrol unit. - Just do what I say. Avi won't like this. Go get him. Get him. I'm sorry, sweetie. I know you are just doing your job. I told you, I don't know anything about it. Look outside. Go ahead, look. What is he doing here? Do you know he employs illegal workers? Israel takes this very seriously. His business could be shut down. You bitch! I'm going to fuck you up! Sit him down. Let go! Are you more loyal toward Buaron or your dad? You decide. Don't you dare harm him! He seems like a nice man. Too bad he has a son like you. I'll let the border police handle his case... You know what this stuff is? See for yourself, you bitch! What's going on, Noga? Did you get into a fight again? You are not here. You are not here. If I'm not here, then why are you talking to me? You are not here. I'm hallucinating. You are not here. It is a hallucination. It is all in my head. Only in your head? What about your heart? You once told me I'm the only one who stole your heart, right? Look at me. Noga, I'm here. I know what you are up to. What? You want another baby to replace Idan. No. I don't want to replace Idan. I don't want another child. Don't say that. Then why are you doing this? Idan is your son. Have you forgotten us already? I could never forget you. Don't forget us. I don't know what to tell you, Doron. He promised he would call me. It has been three days since I heard from him. I know he's a big boy, but... All right. I'll call if there's any news. No, I'm going home. I promise. Okay. All right. Bye, darling. Can I have a cigarette? Sure. Thanks. Kids? What? I heard you talking on the phone. Is it about your kid? He's not a kid anymore, actually. They never stop being kids. Yes. - Can I help? - What? - I'm a cop. - Really? Yes. It's about my son. He flew to Colombia with his friend, and I'm worried. Colombia? A few days ago. Why are you worried? He flew there to look for... Forget it. Never mind. I don't even know what I'm doing here. I just couldn't stay at home. I doubt the police can help you out. Did you call the embassy? Yes, that's exactly what the cop inside told me to do. I called the embassy this morning, but they didn't understand what I'm talking about. It never ends. What? Worrying about them. Thanks anyway. I'm sure it will be okay. Have you lost your minds? Are we the police or the mafia? Whose idea was it to bring in Kantor's dad to make him talk? Do you realize how many laws you broke? - It was my idea. - Our idea. Don't start fighting for credit. Avi, he's Buaron's relative. He must know something. You don't arrest an innocent man just to help your investigation, so cut the crap! We are releasing Kantor. Just pray that he does not press charges. - Now, get out. - Avi, he attacked Noga! - Just for that, he deserves... - Yaki! Go out. Noga, hold on. I only called Noga, Yaki. Amsalem informed me that they are closing the case. I'm sorry. You know the drill. No evidence, no case. I wanted you to hear it from me before it gets out. It sucks, I know. All evidence seems to point to Katzover, but nothing really holds up. He's a clever son of a bitch. I asked to have the files sent over in case you want to go over them. What for? You said it's futile. Even if there was evidence, it won't bring them back. Bye. - What did he say? - They are closing the case. What case? Ophir and Idan's case. For lack of evidence. Damn it. Look at the cocky bastard. I told you, sweetie. You were just wasting your time on me. Too bad, right? We know that Moshiko is in South America. Once we find him and find out you gave false testimony, you will go to jail, too. Even if I knew that he is in Colombia, do you really think I would rat him out? He's family. You don't do that to a family member. But, well, what do you know about that? Family? Kantor, I suggest you shut up. Trust me, Noga. I was sorry to hear what happened to you. No child should die that way. - Being burned alive... - You piece of shit! Why don't you let me do it myself? You can do many things by yourself, but it's best if Mommy brushes your teeth. - Let me do it! - No, sweetie. Okay, fine. But you have to give up all your favorite desserts. - Then you do it. - Okay. Okay, rinse. Looks like I'll have time to give you guys a ride. You don't have to. Why not? I would love to give you a ride. Let's go, Idani. You are riding with Mommy. Will you let me turn on the siren? No. I forgot my phone. Take the keys. Let's go. Daddy, turn on the flashers. - Are you not sick of them? - No. Take off your backpack. Come on, Daddy, just this once. HOME You little... Don't tell your mom. Is it some kind of facial cream? Yaki, smear some on his face. His skin looks kind of dry from here. - Yes, I noticed that too, Kantor. - Am I right? What are you looking for? - Something. - What? I'll know when I find it. Can't it wait till the morning? - Are you worried about me? - Actually, I am. - Get this away from me. - Relax, Kantor. - It's just facial cream. - Get that away from me! I know that your cousin Moshiko Buaron is in South America now. What do you know about that? I don't know what you want from me. What are you smiling about? - We never mentioned "Colombia." - What? When Kantor was released, he told me, "Even if I knew he's in Colombia, I would not rat him out." None of us said "Colombia" during the interrogation, we only mentioned "South America." Son of a bitch! Well, are you here to apologize? Seize his computers. You don't learn, do you? I'm calling my lawyer. Call from the station. You are under arrest. - What now? - Now, we let him sweat. Yes, Grossman? Talk to me. What else? Are you kidding? Thank you, man. Good job. Was that Grossman from the Tech Team? Yes. He managed to find e-mails sent from Kantor's computer to some Israeli guy in Colombia. - And then? - The Israeli guy is Ronen Levinger, a senior employee at the Israeli embassy in Bogota. BOGOTA YESTERDAY They won't cooperate. You should send them the fax... Get out! Search the toilet bowl. The embassy security arrested him. The shithead tried to escape, and he won't talk to anyone before he arrives in Israel. What about his e-mails to Kantor? They are still investigating them. There might be another go-between. Someone local. Some guy named Cortez... All we have got so far is his name. We can't crack this case from Israel. I need someone to go there in person. He refuses to cooperate in Colombia because he would be of more use to us there. He must know names and places. That's why he wants to leave. Avi, I can't fly out to Colombia, I'm in the hospital. The hospital? I'm all right, but I can't leave the country right now. I need to send someone there. Then send Yaki. I'm sure he would be happy to do it. I'm not getting in trouble with Dafna. I'll talk to Yoav from the Intelligence Team. All right. Avi, I have got to hang up. I'll talk to you later, okay? I'm sorry. I told you not to play with the ball in the hall. Noga, we are going to put you to sleep now. The procedure itself is short, only 15 to 20 minutes long. Get some rest. You look like you could use it. No, don't try to sit up. You are still too weak. Did everything go well? Look, Noga. The follicles were empty. We retrieved a few, but... they were eggless. There's no need to worry. We will continue the treatment, and it was your first procedure, so I'm sure it will be fine. All right. Keep resting. I'll come by later to take a blood sample. Okay, thank you. Avi, I'll do it. I'll fly out to Colombia. {\an8}TODAY. {\an8}It's no surprise that he refuses to cooperate. - He has got some nerve. - Yes. He's scared. I bet he's in trouble with the locals. If that's the case, an Israeli prison is his better option. Avi, I've got to go. I'm letting him sweat for now. He's not as tough as he thinks he is. Okay. Give me an hourly update. Sure thing. Bye. What's going on? That girl wants to speak with Ronen. - With Ronen? Why? - I don't know. - She won't tell me why. - Call her over. I want to talk to her. We at the embassy don't know of any such incident. Cortez? Why would she make that up? There was a guy named Cortez mentioned in the e-mails Ronen sent Buaron's guy. You have regards from Pablo Cortez. I need to check your wound, okay? Okay, man. Easy. Am I going to die, man? - You will be fine. God willing. - God willing? That's the best you have got? "God willing"? - That means I'm in deep shit. - I did not say you will die. Now, be quiet and let me focus. Conserve your energy. This is going to hurt. Himmler? Benda? Come on! Go catch the dogs. POLICE STATION Your friend from the Israeli embassy talked. We know about your link to Moshiko Buaron. I know you are just a sardine. I want to catch the big fish. But if you don't cooperate with me, Pablo, I'll settle for only taking you down. Pablo. How many years have you used to sit on my side of the desk, knowing that whoever sat on the opposite side is in serious trouble? Now, I get to say to you what you have said to others many times. "Let me help you, Pablo." It burns, man! What are you doing, Dubi? What? It will ease the pain. Dubi, no needles. Relax. Dubi. No needles, man. Be quiet. Dubi, I said, no needles! Dubi, get away from me! Damn it! I said, no needles, Dubi. Hey, boss! Where is Buaron? We know he's planning a large delivery. Your colleague from the embassy said it's going down soon. I want a written guarantee. What guarantee? A guarantee that I'll stay untouched if I tell you what I know. You have my word. I'll be fair with you. But right now, you won't get any written guarantee. - That's a problem. - It's your problem, not mine. I don't have a problem. Where is Buaron? He contacts me only by phone whenever he needs my help. I'm not part of his system. Where are the drugs produced? The people who produce the drug for him are members of a group, a cult. They have a guru whom they call, "Pale Father." Pale Father is an urban legend. That's what he wants you to think. But he's real. And where is this Pale Father? Somewhere around La Esperanza, the abandoned city. Dubi! Benda? Himmler! Dubi! Benda! Himmler! Azoulay! Danino, don't wake up the dead. Azoulay? Subtitle translation by Hagit Harel
