 $500. The thing that you shot into your veins this week was costs $500. Don Carlos, you know me. I'll cover all my debt. I'll pay it all back. Hey, man. Do you need cash? No, I don't need anything. - I asked if you need cash. - I don't need anything. Next time, he'll cut your dick off. Not now, sweetie. Happy anniversary, honey. What's that?

 It's yours, remember? Mine? You gave it to me the day we met. I told you I would return it to you when times are better. I feel those times have arrived. WHEN HEROES FLY {\an8}THE SERIES IS BASED ON THE BOOK WHEN HEROES FLY BY AMIR GUTFREUND. {\an8}EMBASSY OF ISRAEL BOGOTA. What are those? Those are forms. Fill them out, and we can start working on your request. Are you serious? We just told you, her life might be in danger. - Didn't you listen to a word we said? - I did. It's a pretty amazing story. It is. If you don't mind, and I don't mean to offend, it sounds like a movie plot, but... fill out the forms, and we'll move on from there. Ronen, our scanner is broken, may I use yours? Say, Ronen, about the Orphans cult we talked about on the phone... Yes, about the cult, I looked into it, I mean, I tried to, but nobody has ever heard of them. I don't know where you guys heard about them, but in any case, fill out the forms, so we can move on. Could you cut the bureaucracy bullshit? What's going on? - What do you expect? - We expect you to help us find my sister. Okay, so start by filling out the forms, it's protocol. We'll send them to Israel and see... No way! He's going to send them to Israel? - Aviv. - Are you insane? Don't get mad, I'm on your side. I get what's going on here. Do you have a boss we can talk to? Listen, this is getting out of hand. You guys seem really nice, but anyone else who hears this story would think you're kidding. - Your story is hard to believe, okay? - I pay your salary, - and you throw these forms at me? - Call security! - You're calling security? You loser! - What do you want from me? - All I can do is follow protocol. - Ronen, I know it sounds unbelievable, we just need your help finding my sister. Don't touch me! I'll let myself out. - Is everything fine now? - Yes. - What can I say? He pissed me off. - For a change... You heard the way he spoke to me. - Dov? - Yes, who is this? Hey, my name is Hila, the one who came into Ronen's office. You and your friend really messed up his desk. - Who gave you my number? - The receptionist. There's something that I think you should know about that cult, the Orphans. Wait, I'll put you on speaker, okay? Go ahead. A few weeks ago, some hysterical mom called us from Israel. A local hostel contacted her after her son thrashed his room, ran naked around the lobby, and made a big mess. She said that he spoke about that cult the last time he called her. But Ronen just told us that he never heard about that cult. After that incident, the embassy gave a warning that we can't talk about it. Is there any way we can contact that guy? Hila? Well, a few days after he returned to Israel, he killed himself. Do you remember his name? Yes. Nevo Moreno. I also know which hostel he stayed in. Let's go celebrate tonight at Matiz. - Shall we? - One second, sweetie. - Where are you? - At the embassy. They weren't any help to us. - The embassy? When did you go there? - We left the hostel early. Himmler stayed in. He didn't feel well. Anyway, we're on our way to a hostel in La Candelaria. An Israeli guy who may be related to the cult stayed there. We're going to check it out. No, come here. Let's go together. - Are you sure, man? - Yes, come over. Sweetie, tonight is not a good time. How about tomorrow? Dollars. A lot of dollars. Where did you get this? What? This passport. I don't know, man. - Hey, what's up? - What's up, man? Say... Do you have any more of those joints? You want to smoke, man? I have a splitting headache I can't get rid of. Come in, man. We have miracle drugs here. Yes? I need you to check something out for me. - What's up, Dubi? Are you hungry? - I am. Always. - Should I whip up some shakshuka? - No, we should head out. - Are you sure? - Yes. I want to check out the hostel where that Israeli guy stayed. Sweetie, I'm going out with the guys. - I want to join you. - You don't have to. - I want to. - Can Maria tag along? Sure, it's even better if she does. It's more likely they'll talk to her than to us. - Cool. - Cool? Cool. How's your head? Perfect, man. This is some powerful stuff. It's not the crap you have in Israel. You got that right. So what are you doing here? Smoking. I mean, in Colombia, man. Midlife crisis? Why? Do I look 40 to you? I don't know. - Good afternoon. - What room are the Israelis staying in? That one. So what do you do? I make money. A lot of money. For real? How? I was born right. Married? Any children? Oh, man. You're the chattiest pothead I've ever met. Smoke and shut up, what's up with the questions? Well, I'm interested in people. No, I'm not married. Adopt Dan-dan. He would love to have a rich dad. Dan-dan. Do you want me to adopt you? Sure. What about you? What do you plan to do with your life? I had a dream of owning a small farm. You know, taking care of sheep and chickens, and growing my own food. - Go for it. - Are you kidding? My dad will disown me if I tell him I want to be a farmer. What were you like when you were 22? When I was 22? I thought I was king of the world. And then what? Then reality kicked in. Come on. It sounds to me like your life is perfect. Do you want to hear a cliché? Shoot. You only live once. There's no second chance. - That's heavy words, dude. - Listen to me, kid. Twenty years from now, you'll find yourself married, with a little pot belly, sitting in your apartment in Modi'in without Dan-Dan or that fringe on your head. You'll only be with your wife, with her short haircut and cellulite, thinking back at the time you smoked in Colombia with some millionaire from Herzliya who told you to screw it all, but you didn't listen to him. That's what's going to happen. And it would suck. Because you only live once, man. And sometimes, it would be "game over." Just like that. And nobody prepares you for that. Modi'in. Good morning. Good morning. Could you help us with something? Sure. What is it? Our Israeli friend, Nevo Moreno, stayed here once, do you remember him? - He's your friend? - Yes. He destroyed his room. He still owes us money. Please tell him that's no way to behave. Look, Nevo is dead. We were curious, did you ever get a chance to speak with him? Do you know what he was doing in Bogota? How did he die? Suicide. I'm sorry. I kept his stuff as collateral, hoping he would be back to pay for the damages, but I didn't know... - His stuff? - His mochila bag. He left it here the day the police took him. I found it. WHERE ARE YOU GUYS? AT A HOSTEL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN. I'LL SEND THE ADDRESS. COOL, I'LL BE THERE. Follow him. Yakir? What's up, Yaeli? What are you doing here? Give me a hug. It's good to see you. This is crazy. Where did you find this? On the street. How did you track me down? There are several Israeli hostels in Bogota. It was a lucky shot. Thank you. You saved me. I made phone calls, went to the embassy, and tried to get a temporary passport, but... I couldn't. I was supposed to take a trip tomorrow, outside Colombia. - Well, now you can. - Yes. So, how are things, Yaeli? Terrible. What about you? I'm fine. Just chilling. What are you doing here in Bogota? Weren't you supposed to be in Los Angeles? Dubi said... I went there. I just rolled from place to place, and now I'm here. - Are you okay? - Yes. Why? Do I look like I'm not okay? I'm fine. You're all alike. What do you mean? Liars. Just like Aviv. He lied to himself so much that he started believing his own lies. How is Aviv doing? You don't know? No. I've lost touch with those guys. Aviv had a breakdown, Benda. I tried to help him, but he didn't want it. He didn't want me. He didn't want us to be together. I didn't know what to do. I'm worried about him. Every time I get a call from Israel, I get scared that there's bad news about him. Well, I... I've got to pack up for my trip now. Thanks for the passport. Go home, Benda. Stop lying. Stop running away. Check this out. What's that? It looks like a diary. "Padre Palido." "Padre Palido..." The Pale Father. He talked about him all the time. - Who? - Your friend. At first, I thought he was talking about his own father. He would yell, "Father!" But then, I realized it's someone who's part of some cult. The photographer said that. Anything else you can tell us about him? No. I've never heard that name before. No, she says she has never heard that name before. I have. What? I've heard of that name before. It's dangerous, Benda, you know you can't go there alone. It will be all right. I'm just going there to talk to him. He might be able to help us. - Let me come with you. - Forget it, my love. - Please... - I don't want you to go back there. There's no way you can come. Do you hear me? It will be all right. Okay? Okay. What's up? How did you know this man, Carlos? I just do. Why does it matter? I'll go in alone. You guys stay in the car and keep a low profile. Nothing has changed here. What is this place? Are you sure you don't want me to come with you? I'm sure. I know him. If he sees a group of four guys, he won't be nice. It will be fine. We're continuing the news broadcast. The police are still searching for... Let go! You son of a bitch! It's mine! Give it back! You loser, give it already! Leave me alone! - You bastard! - You bastard, scram! Are you okay? Are you okay? I want that. Here's my ring in exchange. It's worth a lot. Look. Okay? Good afternoon. So far, we know of three casualties. Two more are still missing following the fatal accident that occurred outside the town of La Esperanza. The victims are presumed to be Israeli tourists. The search for the two missing people is ongoing. MISSING Are you okay? Is it because of the ring? Hello. What do you want? Is Carlos here? - Get lost. - Hey, calm down. He knows me. I just came to say hi. Tell him I want to talk to him about the Pale Father. How are you doing, Don Carlos? I'm sorry for showing up uninvited. I need to talk with you. That's it. Aviv! - What are you doing? - I can't just stay here. - You heard what Benda said. - Yes. But I have a bad feeling about this. Himmler, turn the car around, facing the street. Do you remember me? Benda, the Israeli. I used to hang out here a lot a few years ago. What do you want? I need help. I'm looking for the Pale Father. The Pale Father? Yes. - No, Carlos. - You know something about the Pale Father? Don't shoot. Please, don't shoot! Carlos, please. Don't shoot! Please! I swear, I'm not a cop! - What do you know about the Pale Father? - I don't know anything! - Nothing? - Nothing, I don't know anything! - Tell me! - I don't know anything! - What do you know? - Nothing, I swear! - What do you know? - Nothing! Everything is cool. Benda! - What's going on? - Fuck. - Benda! Are you all right? - Yes, man. - Is that Carlos? - Yes. Aviv, watch out! Benda, let's get out of here! Get in the car! Drive, Himmler! - Are you all right, Benda? - Yes. - What? - I'm fine! - What was the shooting about? - I don't know. - What happened? - They shot Carlos. - Who did? - I don't know! Aviv.
