 Row, row, row, your boat Gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life is but a dream (SlNGlNG VOlCE ECHOlNG) The Final Voyage of The Magus. Yeah, it's a good title, right? Well, I will get home, I will get to work and I will cut together, what, eight episodes? I'll give everyone their happy ending. And I will move past what needs ignoring. And I will make this expedition Iook every bit the adventure it was. And maybe a bit more. You know, I'm glad he's alive. Glad to see them back together again. CLARK: Yeah, just like you always were.

 Yeah. No, I mean, well, it's different now, you know? LlNCOLN: After this how could we be the same? Any of us. Why did I stay? I think I wanted to see if they'd actually find Emmet. I forgive him. He hung me out to dry, but in a weird way, if he hadn't, we'd both be dead. Doc saved my life a long time ago. Of course we came after him. CLARK: Would you do it again? Would you come here for him? (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) We are back where GPS can read us again. Now, we go upriver, to the entrance to the Boi?na, back where we began. Then everyone goes home. Home. So, you're gonna take some time? Family? Friends? Friend? Might. Why? Well, it's just that when you were in that tunnel, you mentioned someone. David, was it? He's someone I owe an apology to, okay? (TYPlNG) You're gay? Why didn't you say something? Because we're not friends. Plus it hasn't exactly come up out here, has it? I don't go clubbing when I'm running away from ghosts. I would like to have sex. Yeah, not even picky. Just the sex, please. When I was little, I always used to have Lincoln sing to me. "Row, row, your boat. " Till I fell asleep. It's funny, I had the song backwards. Life is but a dream I always thought that it meant that life back home was real and life on the boat was the dream. But the time on the boat, on the stream, on the river, that was real life. Then I grew up. (BOY'S VOlCE SlNGlNG LULLABY) CLARK: One thing left to do. We got Emmet Cole back. It's time to get some (BLEEP) answers. Okay, why did you come to the Amazon? I came because I thought I was supposed to find something. But that's over now. How the hell did you survive that place, huh? The things we saw you do, the magic? What are you, now? Are you a (BLEEP) dragonfly? I should have died. A hundred times over, I should have died. And I mean, maybe a little piece of me did every time. Only part of me left is the husband and the father. It was a mistake to come here. People who tried to help me got hurt. And people died because of me. I have a lot of making up to do. That's all I have to say. (KNOCKS) Hey. You know, I'm not gonna find the words to make this right. Your father, he followed me out here, he trusted me. I failed him. I trusted you, too. I did everything that you asked. And I believed in what you were doing out here. And I need to know what my role in this is. I mean, this mark on me, it means something, doesn't it? It's a birth mark. I thought you were meant for something special. I did. I thought I was, too. Well, what if you were right? I mean, what we've seen out here, it's incredible. Yeah, there are signs of the impossible everywhere in this place. But now I know they are signs to get out. The Boi?na does not want us here. I'm sorry. No. No! You don't get to just be sorry. I mean, my dad is dead because of you. I know that you were looking for more than just magic out here. What is it? Tell me. What is the Source? It's better you hate me. No map, with no real direction, no radio, and you found him. We all did. No, no, no, no. It was you. You know, of all the things that we saw out here, you just might be the most astonishing. Emmet's back and I'm never letting him go again. When he left, I made a mistake. God! (EXCLAlMS lN ANGER) (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (ELECTRlClTY POWERS DOWN) (EXHALES DEEPLY) Lena's pretty pissed. Yeah, that's not gonna change soon. Thank you, Son. You came for me when you had a lot of reason not to. Well, Mom had to do some convincing. Yeah, you know, maybe when we get back, I can come to Chicago. You know, I can spend time, visit, you know. And maybe, you could come to the house for the holidays. We could do a Christmas thing. Dad, Dad, come on. Take it easy. Look, if we're gonna be friends, we'll get there. Right now, let's just get home, okay? Yeah, I just want you to know that... You know, even when we fought, you know, or weren't speaking, or when you said you were never gonna set foot on the Magus again... That didn't work out too well, did it? Look, no, I got... Yeah, I won that one. (CHUCKLES) I just mean, since you were nine years old, you've been your own man. And I've been proud of that. Back when I was nine, you wouldn't have said something like that unless the cameras were back up and rolling first. You got it on tape. "Good wrap up moment, Linc. Nice work." But this... The tapes from this expedition are going in the fire. Nobody's ever gonna know what happened here. Dad! Watch out! (GUNSHOTS) No! No! No! No! Lincoln! - Hey! Hey! - TESS: Oh, my God! Lincoln! - LENA: What happened? - Oh, no, no, no, no! - No! No! Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! (YELLlNG) Clark, get the health pack. - Come on, Jahel! - Oh, my God! AJ, what did you see? (ALL SHOUTlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY) Get in there. Get in there. Get in there! Get in there. Get in there, come on! - Get the gauze cover. - Lincoln! Lincoln! - Don't leave me! Come on, please... - No, stop, stop, stop! He's gone. He's gone. What? He's gone. No, no! No, no, no, no, no! Emmet! No, no, no! No! No, Emmet, please! Emmet, no, please. No! (SOBBlNG) No! Oh, my God, no! No! (SCREAMlNG) We are not leaving until somebody confesses. (CRYlNG) Who did this? Somebody must have seen something that... Emilio... JONAS: But the cameras are out. We can't even go back and check the tapes. AJ: Well, it wasn't me, I was filming. My alibi is in HD. CLARK: It could be anyone here. KURT: Or you. What? Why would Clark want to shoot me? Yeah, of course, I wouldn't. But it's not like we're wanting for motives around here. You left him hanging in the tree. Hey, look, that was my own fault, and I don't blame you. You left her father to die. I would never. You're my family. Look, the only one trained to take the shot here is Kurt, isn't it? I wouldn't have missed. JONAS: That's not a denial. I didn't shoot anyone. I'm here to protect you. CLARK: Really? Well, I've got a tape downstairs that says otherwise. You called someone, and you told them that if Emmet found the Source, "You'd put him down." You knew this? Why didn't you... Is this true? Is it true? (SHOES SQUEAK) If I wanted any of you dead, you would be dead. Trust me. Whoever did this, whoever killed my son, you will be found out. And I swear to God, you will suffer. (RADlO STATlC) (STATlC CONTlNUES) (STATlC CONTlNUES) (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (STATlC CONTlNUES) EMMET: So, Kurt, where did you find him? He was the only one who knew this part of the river and who would do it for the money. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) TESS: Emmet, is that even possible? Jahel. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (SlGHS) What does she mean, the Boi?na? I thought it was just this part - of the river. - No. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) Even if it could bring our son back? We don't know that. And even if it could, there are some things you don't call out. Jahel. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) Then you bring me back my son. No matter what it takes. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (ELECTRlClTY CRACKLES) (THUNDERCLAP) (PANTlNG) (CRlES) (THUNDER CRASHlNG) (TESS SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (SHOUTlNG lN SPANlSH) (LOUD ROARlNG) (HlGH-PlTCHED WAlLlNG) (SCREAMlNG) AJ: What's going on? I don't know. (SCREAMlNG) (LOUD ROARlNG) What did you do? Mom... (SOBS) (SlGHS) - CLARK: AJ... - Yeah. - You getting this? - Every inch. How is it possible? It's not. TESS: You're alive. You're back. He's hot. TESS: You okay? (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) I know who killed me. - This is a mistake. - (GUN BELT CLlCKS) I didn't shoot him. You're sure it was him? You saw Kurt fire? Yeah. I trusted you. Do whatever you want. I didn't do this. Be careful. Go to hell. I mean, the guy was dead, right? You saw that. Yeah, I did. I can't wait to go home. (WHlSPERS) I died? How could l... Well, the Boi?na, it protected me when I should have died. I don't know how, and I don't know why, but it chooses people. I love you, Dad. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) I routed our way home, save time and gas. It's a hell of a lot easier with the GPS picking us up. And safer. How's Lincoln? I'm worried about him. Listen, I think we invited something dark. To get him back. I mean, I thought for a second... He hugged me. He told me he loves me. Of course he loves you. He hasn't said that since he was a kid. Well, he may not have said it, but he's shown it a thousand different ways. By coming here, by looking for you. (SlGHS DEEPLY) Your son tells you he loves you, and it's a reason to be suspicious. Must have been some kind of father. - (KNlFE CHOPS) - (SlGHS) (PLASTlC CRlNKLES) (GROANS) (SlGHS) JONAS: Well, it's not every day you see a dead guy making a sandwich. (CHUCKLES) It's nice you got an appetite. I'm starving. Fingers are still numb. Well, here, let me help. Gave us quite a scare, Doc. You deserve to get home in one piece. Why? Because I saved your life? That. And you're a good guy. (SNlFFS) Not like my dad, though, right? Is that why you tried to kill him? 'Cause he left you for dead? I mean, it's a good reason. I know you shot me, Jonas. You saw me? (PLATE CLATTERS) Right before you killed me. (SlGHS) It's okay. It's okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh. I didn't tell anyone. I mean, why would l? I'm curious, though. (SlGHS) Were you just gonna let Kurt sit in there, take the blame? Why did you tell them it was Kurt? Because Kurt and I have unfinished business. And because you, El Colgado, (CHUCKLES) I wanted to kill you myself. (GASPlNG) - Okay, okay, you ready? - No, no, listen, if I'm gonna die out here, Lincoln, you gotta know the truth, all right? Come on! Come on! Oh. Can I help you with something? Just catching up. There's a gap in the footage, when the Morcegos, they boarded the ship. Looked like you were about to die. Yeah, well, bunch of blind camera operators? Totally unusable. Shot over it with the dead birds falling out of the sky. Saved a tape. Thank you. Thank you, man, for taking care of Tess. Yeah, you know, just a producer tending to his star. You're a good friend. I'm a selfish bastard who came here to make a TV show, okay? Truth is, I was shocked we found you alive. But, hey, look, it's all good now, right? Yeah? Happy endings, family reunited, Lincoln's back from the grave. Back on track. Feel free. (GROANS) Well, it's not every day you see a dead guy making a sandwich. Just like my dad used to make them. All right, take care. (STATlC) Hey, you wanna talk? About what? (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (EMlLlO CONTlNUES SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) You're not Lincoln, are you? (SPEAKlNG GERMAN) (VOlCE DEEPENlNG) (SlGHS) Have you got nothing else to film? Didn't someone just return from the dead? AJ: I think the real story is right here, no? Love lost, withheld. Epic self-pity. (BLEEP) (BLEEPlNG) off! What are you gonna do, then, you mug? You're gonna drink until you forget you love her? You know what? I've just about had enough of your gobby, gobby little ways! You've been banging... What the... What's that? Oh, my... What the hell is that? Hey. How're you feeling? Well, at some point people are going to stop treating me like l... Like you died? Yeah. Does it hurt? Can I touch it? How are you gonna explain this one to Jillian? I don't think things are gonna work out with her. I'm sorry. Why? Because of you, Lena. Lincoln. No, listen to me, you have to hear this. When I was gone all I could think about was getting back to you. Lena, you're so strong, you're so special. You don't even know how much, but I do. I've watched you a long time. Mmm. Here, drink this. And then come with me. I've wanted this a long time. Me, too. (GAGGlNG) Ugh! Oh! (STRAlNED VOlCE) What did you do to me? I learned a few things about demons out there. I just had to be sure. Now, let go of my son. (GROWLlNG) (GROWLS) Jonas is dead? Can I see him? Well, you can, but I don't think you'd recognize him. How could Lincoln do that? It wasn't him. There's something's inside him. Something we have to get out. - I'm going with you. - You can't be there. - Emmet... - You can't be there. I'll handle it. Lena's gonna help me. (ROARS) (SCREAMlNG) There's magic out there. (LAUGHS EVlLLY) There's magic out there. - (PANTlNG) Is that Lincoln? - No, no. When Jahel opened the door for Lincoln, it allowed another spirit to enter along with him. - What is it? - You know nothing. You have no idea what's out there. Maybe so, maybe so. But I know who's in there. The Black Snake, the Boi?na itself. He's mine! You take from me, I take from you. Now, now, now! (THUNDERCLAP) The dragonfly seeks out the spirit. - (CLlCKlNG) - God, it's getting hot! Just keep it on! Keep it on him. - Emmet, it's really hot! - Keep it on him! - Emmet! - Keep it on him! Emmet! - (GLASS SHATTERS) - Oh! Aah! (LENA GASPlNG) (ROARS) (SPlTS) You came to me, you sailed on my waters, to steal my secrets. You know, better men have died for this. You're nothing! (SNARLS) (ROARS) (SCREECHES) LENA: Emmet? EMMET: Don't be afraid. He's not Lincoln! How would you know? You made the whole world love you except the one person you should have. You don't know your own son. Of course I do. (lN LlNCOLN'S VOlCE) Dad, Dad, what's my girlfriend's name? What am I researching at school? What nightmare have I had every night since I was nine years old? (lN DEEPER VOlCE) I've only been with your son a few hours and I already know him better than you. You like this, Mom? You like to watch? I know the quiet one does. Clark Quietly, always watching. Always waiting. You know, your body wasn't even cold when he (BLEEP) her. (LAUGHS EVlLLY) You didn't know that, did you? I know more than you think. (EMMET CHANTlNG) (GRUNTlNG) (GROANS) Aah! No! Dad, it hurts! It hurts. Oh, God. Tess, what is that? (SPEAKlNG LATlN) It's Latin. He's praying. Lena, help me! Emmet, Emmet, you're hurting him. - Listen. - Lena, help me! He's hurting me. LENA: Emmet, you have to listen. - You're hurting him. Emmet! - Lena! Help me! Stop! Stop it! You have to stop! Stop! Aah! (CRYlNG) Let her go! Let her go! Emmet! Emmet! Look at her. So innocent. Emmet! Help me! But your thoughts aren't that innocent, are they? Lincoln, Lincoln, put me down. All those nights we were alone together on the Magus, I could hear you thinking of me. Put me down! (SOBBlNG) Emmet! (lN CHlLD'S VOlCE) Row, row, row, your boat Gently down the stream Merrily No! No! Merrily No! Merrily Lincoln, please! Merrily No! Life is but a dream Let her go! (GROANlNG) Aah! (THUDS) (ROARlNG) (SCREECHES) (ROARS) (PANTlNG) Okay. TESS: Is she okay? It is so strong. Emmet, we can't let it have him. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) We have to do something. I don't know what to do. I don't know. Well, maybe there's someone who does. (LATCH CLlCKS) - (DOOR CREAKS) - (GRUNTS) Did you plan to kill my husband? (WHlSPERS) Yes. Are you going to? No. You've been holding back from me the whole time. Who the hell are you, Kurt? What are you doing here? And what do you know about the Boi?na? (THUNDERCLAP) More than you do. Enough to save my son? (ROARlNG) No one, not a priest, a shaman, a doctor, can draw a spirit out of a body. It has to be forced out from inside. By Lincoln. How does he do that? Stop talking to the demon. Talk to your son. You have to pray that Lincoln is still inside, that he can hear us, that he is still listening, that he wants to come back. And if he doesn't? Then we've lost him. Lincoln. You gotta come back to us. Please, you just gotta listen to me. Everyone who listens to you ends up dead. Ignore the demon. Talk to Lincoln! This is the price you pay for seeing too much. No, no, no, no. I haven't seen enough. (LlNCOLN GROANS) (LlNCOLN PANTlNG) I haven't seen enough. I'm sorry, Lincoln. For everything I've missed. Your first word, I'm on the plane to Tanzania. I'm under water 300 feet below when you take your first steps. (LlNCOLN'S VOlCE) Dad? He can hear you, help him fight. Your first kiss, you and Lena, right here on this ship. The only way I knew is 'cause Russ told me. - Dad, it hurts! - Just fight it! I can't! - You can! - Aah! (VOlCE DEEPENS) No, you trespassed on my ground, stole my secrets. Now, I'll take his life. There is so much left to do. (VOlCE BREAKS) You've got your whole life ahead of you. (PANTlNG) Your future, your wedding, your kids. I'll be there every step of the way. I'm not gonna miss another minute. (SOBS) Just come back. No! We are at war! (GLASS SHATTERS) (WHlSPERS) Oh! (CRYlNG) I'm sorry. (WHlSPERS) I'm sorry. Lena, I'm so sorry. Exit from the Boi?na is just 2 kilometers from here and we'll be back on the plain old boring Amazon. The break's right after this bend. I say we leave the Magus and Zodiac back out the way we came in. We did it. Home. The Mataqa village and a helicopter are just through there. Where is it? I don't get it. The village should be right here. It doesn't make any sense. It should be right there. We lost the signal. - Clark. - Yeah? We're not on the map anymore. What? We're not on the map anymore. - AJ. - Yeah? - Get the eye in the sky, mate. - All right. The river's changing. It's never gonna let us go.
