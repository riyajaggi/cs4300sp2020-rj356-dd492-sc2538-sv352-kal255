 The River (2012): Season 1, Episode 3 - Los Ciegos - full transcript 
 When the whole crew of the Magus goes blind due to spores from a tree, lone holdout AJ will have to overcome his most paralyzing fear to find a cure before the blindness becomes permanent. Meanwhile, the local Morcego tribe stalks the crew and judges whether they are worthy to stay in the jungle. If they are deemed unworthy, the consequences could be fatal.

 There's magic out there. REPORTER: Beloved television host, Emmet Cole, has been reported missing. We can find his ship, we can find him. CLARK: The network will pay, but they want every moment on camera. I am not leaving this close to finding your father. Sharks. Silent predators. So programed to prevail, siblings will devour one another in the womb in over 16 species. And, cut! Cannibalistic fratricide? Lovely. We're doing a family show, remember, Em?

 (EMMET LAUGHlNG) It's part of nature to turn on your brother. He'd do the same to you. LlNCOLN: Clark. You, uh, you said you had a lead on the next place we should look for my dad. Uh, yeah, yeah, just, uh, printing it out right now. TESS: A cave? Yeah. Shows up all over Emmet's tapes. It's like he kept sending his crew back down there to film it. There must be something going on there. Hey, the color of these rocks, it's volcanic. That puts it somewhere in these northern hills. That's at least a day's hike back into the jungle. Into hostile territory.

 You sure you wanna do this? Yeah. Everybody start packing. We leave at dawn. I'm still here because you're paying me to be. CLARK: We paid you for a rescue mission. With everything we've encountered, I'd say it's turned into a bit more than that, wouldn't you? If the network wasn't paying you to film all this, would you still be here? Of course you would. Emmet Cole is your friend. Why am I still here? I come out of prison and nobody want me. Doc give me a home on this ship. I owe him my life. Come on, camera. We're losing the light. Let's go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Tess. Look, I know you want to find Emmet. We all do, okay? But let's not kill the crew doing it. We got to take five. Let's go. Tess. What do you think? It's a pretty good match, right? Yeah. (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) What for? CLARK: AJ? Yeah? Listen, if Emmet's in there and it's bad news, I want you on the reaction shots, all right? What did I tell you when I signed up? What did you agree to? Before I became a cameraman? You ever hear of the Kaplin mine disaster? The mine collapsed, with me and 22 other working stiffs stuck down there. Nineteen men died. Four of us almost died. Although at the time, we wished we did. You know, 300 feet under rock for days. You know, it's... Now I'm a nature photographer. Plenty of air. Plenty of sunshine. Plenty of, uh... Never going underground again. I will face down a tornado. I will swim with piranha. But I don't do caves anymore. Get in the cave! You know what, mate? - Take the camera. - Are you serious? - Take the camera! - Are you serious? Try me. Emilio. Got a job for you. Dad! Everybody stay close. Hold the light! (ALL GASP) Oh, God! Please, it's not my dad, is it? Emmet? It's not Doctor Cole. Or your dad. Missionary or maybe Peace Corps. He's been disemboweled. Eyes and heart cut out. CLARK: Well, who the hell would've done that to him? (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) Hello? EMlLlO: How much further back does it go? (HlGH-PlTCHED SQUEAK) LlNCOLN: Hey, guys, did you hear that? Yeah. What was that? KURT: It sounds like it's coming from up ahead. (HlGH-PlTCHED SQUEAK) TESS: Kurt, do you see anything? It's beautiful. What is it? EMlLlO: I need more light. KURT: Don't! (BATS SCREECHlNG) Is everyone all right? - Mom? - Yeah. AJ? You okay? You're all covered in bat (BLEEP). You're an (BLEEP). What? What? It's funny. (SlGHS) Find somewhere else to sleep. What the (BLEEP) you doing? Still think it's funny? All right. Gladly. LENA: Are you grooming now? Well, in surgery rotation, they said we should be able to stitch with our eyes closed. So I figure I can trim batcrap out of my hair with a mirror, right? Well, you can't. Come here. God! Been dying to cut this rat's nest since we got on the boat. Really? (ANlMAL GROWLlNG) Do you think it's safe for us to sleep out here? If you wanted safe you'd still be in Colorado selling tourists skis and shirts made out of sun block, right? - Hey! - Ow. Ow. True. I mean, if it were safe out here, they wouldn't have gone missing in the first place. What the holy hell! Uh, guys? You may wanna wake up. You may wanna wake up now. Guys? You okay? What the hell, man? God! CLARK: What is it, AJ? Grab your camera, mate. What is it? You got something? Yeah. TESS: AJ, what the hell is going on? I don't know. I just came here. Who did this? Someone did this to us while we were sleeping. (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) The Morcegos? CLARK: What's that? Go ahead. You can tell them. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) These are their symbols. And this is their land. They're out there, watching us now, all of us. Judging us. Judging us for what? Wait, hang on, what? If we deserve to pass? The Morcego say, "And only those worthy to see the jungle can see the jungle." I'm sorry. I just... I don't understand this girl one bit. The body in the cave, its eyes were cut out. Does that mean we're next? Papa? Papa! Where's Emilio? Emilio! Papa! Papa! Emilio! - Emilio! - Emilio? Papa! - Can you hear us? - Papa! - Emilio! - Emilio! - EMlLlO: Jahel. - Papa! Emilio! Emilio! EMlLlO: Jahel. Papa! We got him! (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) I woke in the night, I went to take a leak. And I walk away and my eyes were in pain. Then everything was blurred. Then black. Well, it could be a bacterial infection from the bat guano. Or a parasite. And there's hundreds of plants out here that mimic neurotoxins. Did you touch anything? Brush anything? No. - All right, stay here. - Okay. Mom, look, I know you want to press on and find Dad. But if Jahel is right about the Morcego, we need to get Emilio back to the Magus asap. CLARK: Whoa, whoa, what are you talking about? Turn back, this far? We just split up. If this tribe wanted to kill us, they would have done it whilst we were sleeping. There's something out there. If you see movement, use this. What? Use it. Guys, come on, let's go. It's a long hike back to the Magus. CLARK: All right, then. (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) Let's go, come on. Come on. AJ: Somewhere over here. I know it. Where are you, camera? Over here somewhere. There you go! Oh, come on, man! Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Excuse me. Look at my camera. No, don't ignore me. It's broken and it's my last ND-six filter. Please, AJ, mind the gear. The cameras cost more than you, mate. Wait, no. Don't look at me. Look at one of these ungrateful prats. Listen, you all think you're tired? I'm the one who has to hike double to retrieve cameras when you're all on your water breaks. I'm the one who has to carry an extra 40 kilos of camera gear. So just have a bit of respect, yeah? That's all I ask. (SCREECHlNG) Uh, what was that? CLARK: Is that them? Is that the Morcegos? (HlGH-PlTCHED SQUEAL) Is that them? They're over there! Whoa! Stop shooting! Bloody hell, I think I got one! I think I got one. I got something. AJ: Congratulations, Clark. You killed a pig. (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Listen, you heard what Lincoln said, okay? There's a thousand things out here that could have gotten into Emilio's eyes. The girl is just getting us a little on edge with her ghost stories. - TESS: Clark... - Every corner of the Amazon has some story legend designed to keep out white people. Clark! We're not here to drill for oil. Clear cut the forest. We're just trying to make a TV show, okay? - Clark! - What? - My eyes are burning. - Mom. - I can't see! - Mom! Okay, are you serious? The blindness. It's spreading. Okay, Emilio, here you go. Grab on, hold on. Hold on. - Watch your step. - Okay. You're good? Jahel, help him. Sit him down. Okay, go in. I'll get you there. - (TESS SCREAMS) - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Careful. I've got her, it's all right, I've got her. Are you all right? Okay, come on. In you come. We need to isolate them. Whatever's causing this might be contagious. Well, if it's contagious, it's too late. How is everyone's vision? Clark? Yeah. - AJ? - Yep, fine. Something itched earlier but... Let me see. Listen, I don't think this is an infection. When we woke up there was that powder all around us, the eye? Well, whatever it is, we need to get them to a hospital. (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) I need to check Emmet's journal. They were at that cave, if this happened to them, they might have figured out a way to cure it. Will you look at the tapes? - Yeah. - There might be an answer there. How you doing, Mom? Kurt, we're in a situation now. Blind in the Amazon? People could die. I know. We need help. Real help. Outside help. Listen. I don't mind a good every-man-for-himself villain on board. It makes for excellent television. I know you have a sat phone stashed in your room. I know it's the only thing that seems to get reception on this river. Now I don't care who you're talking to or what you're planning on doing, but if someone's life is on the line, you are calling your friends. Are we clear? How are your eyes? Okay, so we got enough for you, Emilio and maybe one more. What about you? Don't worry about me right now. We're gonna fix this. Okay, any change? Okay, take this. Keep flushing, okay? I'm gonna check on Emilio. Mayday. Mayday. (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot. Mayday. Mayday. You know, we shouldn't be here. What the hell happened? What have you gotten us into, you old bastard? Oh, my God! Oh, no! No. Don't do this to me! I'm taking us to the middle of the river, away from land. They may try to board the Magus. Any luck on the radio? Any luck on the radio? What is it? (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) Lincoln? Lincoln? Lincoln? Tess, it's me, all right, it's me. Listen. Clark? It's happened, okay? I can't see you. Are you all right? - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay. Clark, what are we gonna do? If this thing can't be treated then we, Emmet and l, might never see each other again. I've been looking at your face for 20 years. I'd never forget your face. I would never forget. You were talking about Emmet. Right, yeah. Don't I look like an (BLEEP). That's fine. It's okay. It's nothing I'm not accustomed to. - Clark. - What? What? There are cameras everywhere. I want you to erase these tapes, I don't want anyone... Yeah, of course. Wouldn't be the first time, would it? Here. Can you make it from here? (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) It's the Morcegos, isn't it? Are they out here? According to Emmet's journal, some native tribes used the dried seeds of Cegos Trees on blow darts to blind animals. So that they're easier to hunt. So how do we cure it? Emmet always said that everything in the Amazon has a counter. For every Yin there's a Yang. It's how the jungle maintains harmony. So, it says here that there's this plant, it's a bulb that grows under the Sentido Tree. Apparently, its sap can neutralize the acid of the seeds. Okay, we find one of these trees and we can see again. If it works. And if we can find it. It grows at elevations of 750 meters. That's a half-day's hike back into the jungle. It's okay. Kurt and I will go. No. If the Morcego is still there, you can't... We don't have a choice. We have to go now. I mean, we could all be affected. It's just a matter of time, right? If we're blind, they'll hunt us and you can forget about finding Dad. We'll all die out here. I'll go get Kurt. Good. (LEAVES RUSTLlNG) What was that? (WATER SPLASHlNG) AJ: They're coming for us, aren't they? Kurt! Kurt, what did you do? Watch his head. I got it! Lincoln, tell me what's going on! What happened to him? Lincoln, talk to me! - Everyone just shut up! Shut up! - Oh, my God! Lena, get me a suture. Quick, now! Stay with me, Clark. Okay? You stay with me. Open your eyes. Here. - Hold this. Hold it. - What do you need? Hold the two sides together. - Keep filming. Keep filming. - It's okay. Sorry, Clark, this is gonna hurt like a bitch. LENA: Hold still. It wasn't a clean cut. I mean, he's sutured. He's stable for now. But if he shows signs of peritonitis, I'll have to go back in. I'm going. I can find the Sentido Tree. If I leave now, I can be back by sunrise. Lena, no, don't go. It's too dangerous. I'll go. My vision's fine. But it could go next. So could yours. They need you here. Keep an eye on Clark. I'll take Kurt. I think he needs to make this one up. Well, take AJ, too. I know, he's the last guy you'd want with you out there but he can see. And who knows how long any of us have. You just have to trust him. (COUGHlNG) Okay, it's okay. All right, all right. Lincoln? - Yeah? - He's hot. Let me have a look. Let me see. Damn it, damn it! Hold still! Your coughing split the sutures. Mom, can you pass me the clean towel? It's over your right shoulder, 3 o'clock. Just keep the pressure on, Ma. Here, hold it and just keep the pressure on, here. Stay still, Clark. Emilio, do you have any fishing line? Ten pound line, couple of feet. (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) Save your energy. Save your energy. There's a clearing up ahead. We could hike from there. You all right? Mom, we need more clean towels. All right. Okay, I'll go get them. You stay here, yeah? Tess, where are you going? Emilio, can you make sure she's okay? Okay. Just hold still, Clark. So how long was it going on? What are you talking about? You and my mom. You're really gonna do this now? You've got your fingers jammed in my... Don't... You serious? Well, I'd like to know the truth. What do you think happened? I think he went missing. I think life was a storm, and you both needed a port. That about right? Yeah, sure. That's what you want to believe, have at it. (EXCLAlMS lN PAlN) (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) EMlLlO: Jahel? Jahel! Emilio! Lincoln, lock yourself in! Lincoln, the other door! The other door! Hold the door! LENA: Kurt? KURT: I don't see anything. AJ: Because you don't see anything or because you don't see. Let's keep moving. Maybe I ought to have a gun, you know? I'm the only one who didn't wake up covered in boogey sticks and stones. I might be the last pair of eyes you got. Oi! Listen, I'm talking to you. Hey, you guys, come on. You can't handle a gun. I haven't stabbed anyone today, have you? Right. I've had enough of you! Pushing me around! What you think this is? Who do you think you are? I'm from Tottenham. You don't mess around with people from Tottenham! That's why, I quit! What is that? What is that? - What? - What is that? Oh, my God! It's them! Run! Oh, God! They're right behind us! (GUNSHOT) Holy Christ! Come on, AJ. Come! Mom, you okay? They're behind the door, but I think it's gonna hold. Are you okay? How's Clark? He's still bleeding. I need that suture line. Where's Jahel? Jahel is in here with me. You're gonna have to make do. (BLEEP) Hey, what are you doing there? What are you gonna do? What the (BLEEP) are you doing? Shut up and let me think. Let me think. All right. I'm gonna have to cauterize your wound. I don't suppose you've got any anesthetic. Yeah, of course you haven't. There's another problem. Yeah? I can't see. I don't see them. I think we're good. Be quiet! Here, you dropped your rifle. Thank you. Go on, then. Take it. How long have you been faking it? Lena? How're your eyes holding up? Fading. Yeah? Well, mine are clear as day. Well, then, you have to take us there. Here. The bulbs are under the Sentido Tree. Or how's I don't? How's instead of I risk my life to save all you lot, combing the Amazon for one plant in a billion? How's about I hike the hell out of here and don't stop until I find civilization? How's about that? AJ, you can't just leave us. I'm sorry, love. But dragging around you two blind mice, getting chased by natives? That just gets me killed with you. Don't worry about it. Soon as I find a nice eco-hotel, I'll grab a sandwich, I'll book a massage and I'll call you a helicopter, yeah? AJ, please? And you? You could've been nicer. LENA: AJ! AJ! AJ. AJ. He's not coming back, is he? No. (CLARK GROANlNG) (BANGlNG ON DOOR) (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) - Okay? - No. - Okay, you ready? - No, listen, if I'm gonna die out here, you need to know the truth, all right? - I don't want to hear it, Clark. - Yeah, you're going to. Your mother, she never did anything wrong, all right? Well, you could tell that to my dad. Yeah, well, I would. But he's not here. Which is the point really, isn't it? Lincoln, he left her. Your father left. Okay? He said he needed to do one last trip. He said he had to come to the Amazon one last time. Right? She was done with it all. She begged him to stay. She pleaded with him, okay? And he chose this. He chose to come out on this bloody thing! All right? She gave him a choice. He chose it. He said this expedition was too important. She never cheated on him. They were separated, okay? She was just trying to move on. She never told me. Of course not. She'd rather you hate her than sully his blessed memory. Now get on with it. Try not to kill me. I've got a TV show to make. (CLARK SCREAMlNG) Just keep moving, Andreus. A few days hike you'll be at a nice Four Seasons with a fat bed, some nice pay per view and no crazy (BLEEP) tribesmen, yeah? No! You've got to be kidding me! It's a (BLEEP) Sentido Tree! Oh, (BLEEP). Hero shot for when Andreus Jude Poulain saves the day. Okay. Come on, now where are you, little bulb? Under the Sentido Tree. All right, then. 'Cause you know, you're supposed to be here. Little bulb. Under the Sentido Tree. Under the Sentido Tree! That's what you meant! Actually under the tree! I have to crawl into a cave? Under a tree! What kind of a (BLEEP) flower grows under the (BLEEP)! (BLEEP) things that I have to do! (BLEEP) a tree! Oh... (GASPlNG) Please, God, no! Please, God, please! Please, please. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no! The bulbs! Is he okay? LlNCOLN: I think so. I cauterized the wound, but I won't know for sure until I can see. Well, you're just gonna have to do the best you can. They're gonna be back soon. We'll hold out for a little while longer. Where are they? Lincoln! Lincoln, they're coming! (BLEEP) Oh, God! No! Jahel. Mom, you okay? Lincoln! They're coming in! Mom! Mom, just find somewhere to hide, okay? Just hide! Mom, can you hear me? There's a knife on the right hand side of the bed. Can you see it? Of course you can't see it... Sorry, Doctor. It's my turn to save you. Someone to kill. I'm here! I'm your man! Come here! I'm your man. Clark! Clark, no! No, Clark! That's it. This way. It's my fault we're here! For desecrating your sacred land. I'm the selfish one. They weren't gonna come down here, but I made them. I paid for them. I bullied them. And the others, they just want their family back. They just want their family back! Dad, I love you. Dad, I'm so sorry, Dad. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. I love you... I love you. If you want someone to judge, you judge me. You blame me. Leave the rest. Just take me. Take me! Take me, just leave the rest! Please! Just take me! Please. (COUGHlNG) Oh, my... Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, God. (SPEAKlNG lN GERMAN) What are you doing? I'm praying. AJ: Hello! Hello? Hello? - AJ? - Yeah? Smile! AJ! Yeah. You came back for us! Don't remind me. It'll be blurry for a while but it will come back. (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) No, no, no, no. (SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH) Don't think this makes us friends now. It's just nice to be able to look out and see. Thanks a lot, Clark. You okay? Yeah. He's a very stupid man. Look, l, uh... I know we're here to find Dad. We're going to. But when we do, and when we go home, I just want you to know. Things don't have to go back to the way they were. You know, it's okay for you to move on. If that's what you want. I want... ...my family back. That's all I want. And I should never have let it come apart in the first place. (KNOCKlNG AT DOOR) I just want to tell you that I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I got scared. My mistake. (BLEEP) off!
