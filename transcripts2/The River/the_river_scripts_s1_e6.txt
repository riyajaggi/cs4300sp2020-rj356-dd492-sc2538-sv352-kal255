 The Magus crew continue their trek to the Sahte Falls where they discover Emmet's camera bag.

 There's magic out there. WOMAN: Beloved television host, Emmet Cole, has been reported missing. We can find his ship, we can find him. CLARK: The network will pay, but they want every moment on camera. I am not leaving this close to finding your father. (STATlC) If we can get Lena as far as lara, we should be able to radio for a helicopter to take her to Mau?s. A day to Manaus, and then home to Boulder. Colorado wasn't her home.

 Mom, she wants to go, okay? Her father's gone. There's no reason for her to be here. That's two days we lose going to Sahte Falls. We know where it is now. Russ practically gave us an address where to find your father... Mom, listen to me, the Falls aren't going anywhere, okay? We get her home, then we track Dad. We'll make up the time lost. Don't wait for me. There's still a chance you can find your dad. Go to the Falls first. I can wait. Cross here? We're good? Yeah. This way. Leafcutter ants.

 Dad was always trying to get me to eat them, said they taste like bacon. (SMACKS LlPS) Not bad, actually. You okay? I'm just thinking about Lena. I was wrong not to let her go home. After losing her father. Can you imagine? I did. Six months ago. Now, as much as you knew he was still alive, I was sure he was gone. In a way it was easier than this, you know? When he was dead I knew what to think. I knew he wasn't suffering. Well, I just want him back. Any way I can have him. Everyone, spread out. Dad! Em! (WHlSTLES) Nothing. Guys! Guys, hey! Come here. What do you got? It was right here in the water. Look. It's Emmet's. Okay, everyone, check the water. Check it! Hey, guys! I've got something. It's a bag. TESS: That's Russ' camera bag. - LlNCOLN: What you got? - Camera. Hello, video. This could tell us where Emmet is. We need to see this. I'm on it. Check that one, would you? See what the state of that is. - I think I've checked that one. - Did you scrape that one? Yeah, we're still piecing it together. But from what we've seen so far, l... I don't know if you want to see this. Just play it. Okay. You ready? (BUTTON CLlCKS) (EXHALES DEEPLY) So, how long do we wait? When do we hear from him? (BLEEP) if I know. (BREATHlNG DEEPLY) (GASPS) (LAUGHS) Lena, I found it. After everything, I know where they are. They're in the Sahte region, near the Falls. It's through some rough territory, but... You said he was just sending you backup. How much contact did you have with him? I never saw any of this. Oh, God! (BREATHlNG HEAVlLY) When I was over the Falls, I felt like I could hear this... That sounds crazy. It felt like I could hear a song. (HUMMlNG 4-NOTE TUNE) See what you can find on that progression. It's, um... (BREATHlNG HEAVlLY) (EMMET WHlSTLlNG) Look in musicology databases. Try Abner, he'll know. Everyone pack up. Cameras, survival gear only. This is it. Hang on. Hey, that's the last of the gas. If you use that up, we're not gonna be able to get out of the Boi?na. We didn't come here to go back. We came here to find something. We found magic, Emmet. Too much. That was a start. Tricks. This is... What? The Source? We can't stay here. The Magus is dead. It's time to move on. The Sahte Falls. That's where they are. No, no, no, it's too far. We've been warned about going there. How many people have to die? Cam, Jonas, Ranier? They're not dead, they're not dead. Don't you see that? What? The Boi?na has tested us before. This, I think this is the last test, right now, to see if we're strong enough. So get strong, Russ, or get out of the way. I'm not gonna let you kill... Lena would be ashamed of you. She understands how important this is. What do you mean, Lena? You've been talking to her? - I told you, "No." - She's stronger than you think. We said no family. Don't bring her into this. Lena's different. You leave her out of it! She's in it whether you like it or not. She's marked for it. (GRUNTlNG) What does he mean "marked"? I don't know. Hey, easy, easy! Hey, break it up. Break it up. Come on. I gave up my life for your dreams. I'm going. I'm going. You want to see something extraordinary, come with me. If not, I understand. At least I've got one friend left. We still invited? We're coming with you. You sure? I might just be a whole can of nuts. I didn't come all this way not to see the fireworks. RABBlT: What I wouldn't give for a sidewalk right about now. (EMMET CHUCKLES) Salsa's not complaining. You are way too happy out in the mud. I always feel lighter when I'm out in the open. Even on the Magus, you know, there's a ceiling. "Till a voice, as bad as Conscience, rang interminable changes. "On one everlasting Whisper day and night repeated, so: "'Something hidden. Go and find it. "'Go and look behind the Ranges. Something lost behind the Ranges. "'Lost and waiting for you. Go."' Kipling. Nice. That's exactly the sort of thing that Clark would've just cut out of the show. (lMlTATlNG CLARK) Now, people, they don't want poetry, love. They want to see your hand almost get cut off. You nearly fall off a cliff... (NORMAL VOlCE) Well, after a while, you kind of lose the urge to say it. The jungle provides everything we need. Some vines hold gallons of water. (WHlSTLES) Yeah, there you go. Inga pods. Tastes like ice cream. How did you even spot this? Monkey showed me. Manny, Manny, Manny, look at this. We're on the right track. What are they? They look like monkey scratches. You don't think they're gonna make it easy. Wait, who? Whoever we're looking for? (BAG THUDS) RABBlT: We came with you. You need to tell us why we're here, what we're looking for. Yeah, you've been whispering with Russ for weeks about some tribe guarding something. The Xulos are a tribe. And the early explorers who met them talked of their unbelievable health. No sickness, complete immunity to disease, impossible healing. One account tells how they ritually flay the flesh under their shoulder blades, scarring their backs, as if they were removing wings. RABBlT: Wings? Because they believe they're angels. Rabbit, look, look. I... I don't see anything. Come here. Look at that, right there. Now move to the side. (BOTH LAUGH) Angels guarding a secret. In the Boi?na, the line that we thought existed between life and death, it blurs. You think of the things we've seen. The ghosts, and the spirits, and the magic. Souls insisting on life when they should be gone. What if everything we've seen, what if it all comes from one Source? The Xulos can lead us there. MANNY: So it's like a place or a thing? That's why we're here. To find out. Maybe tell the world. "Something lost behind the Ranges." (WlND WHlSTLlNG 4-NOTE TUNE) What is it? Doesn't sound like the wind. Is someone whistling? This means we're getting closer. And closer and closer and closer and closer. MANNY: Emmet, pass me one of those minis, will you? Somebody left this on. Oh, yeah. Dinner. Eat up. You need the calories. Okay, you know what? Enough with the bugs. It was cute in The Lion King. But seriously, can we please crack open the rations? We've got a long road ahead. Come on, leafcutter ants are pretty good. I don't taste any bacon. All right, guys, I'm crashing. See you in the morning. I know it's been months, but I still cannot believe that I'm out here with you. Oh, you've more than earned your place. You're a very talented photographer. Only because of you. I mean, I wouldn't have even known about 24 aperture, 750 millimeter natural lens exposures if it wasn't for The Undiscovered Country with Emmet Cole. Yeah, yeah. That's why we did it. To inspire. You must get so tired of these. What? School girl crushes. I had your picture in my locker and everything. I even had the lunchbox. (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry. I thought you and Tess were separated. Not in here. So close to finding them. Maybe tomorrow. Just too excited to sleep. (SlGHS) (WlND WHlSTLlNG TUNE) You hear that? RABBlT: What is that? Emmet? It's calling us. I don't see anything. (SALSA BARKS) - What was that? - RABBlT: Emmet, don't go out there! Salsa, get back here. Salsa! I think he found something. RABBlT: Oh, my God, what is that? Oh, God. Is that the monkey? Just its pelt. What... (GASPlNG) Oh, Jesus! Oh (BLEEP) hell! So we're just not gonna talk about it? What? About how a monkey doesn't skin itself. We're being stalked out here. It just means we're getting close. That thing is a threshold guardian. It's just trying to scare us off the path. Well, we've dealt with these kinds of things before. Sounds like that spirit the fisherman in Juta? warned us about. What did he call it? Il Tunchi. We must have just wandered into its territory. Come on! Our rations are gone too. (MANNY SCOFFS) Il Tunchi. Clever little bastard. - Hey, hey! - TESS: What are you doing? (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) - Wait, hold on, what is she saying? - Hang on, Jonas. (CRYlNG) I've never lost anyone. Hell, I've still got all four of my grandparents. I can't even imagine how... I'm really sorry about your dad. God! Emmet believed in me. He thought I was special. He said I was marked. I've no idea why. Can I trust you? Me? Sure. I mean, I can't vouch for the six cameras looking at us right now, but... No, they're watching the tapes. Emmet's beacon, the one that gave everyone hope, the one that brought us all down here, I set it off. What? Remote satellite link. It was the only way that I could get anyone to come look for my dad. They gave him up, they gave him up for dead. But I felt it, I mean, I knew that they were here and still alive and that we could save them. And I knew I had to come. So I lied. I lied. And now they have to watch him die. Because I was wrong. Come on, Manny, this rain is a gift. (CHUCKLES) RABBlT: He never loses faith, does he? Because he's (BLEEP) nuts. EMMET: How's dinner coming? It's not bugs, so it's fantastic! (MUSlC PLAYlNG ON RADlO) RABBlT: I guess a little food, and everything's right with the world. Nothing to be scared of. Yeah, well, sometimes all you need is a purpose. That's how The Undiscovered Country got started in the first place. It was Tess. She thought I needed a purpose. RABBlT: You? When have you ever not had a plan? (CHUCKLES) There was a time when I had our whole lives planned out. Not even close. Tess and I'd sailed around the world, but she got pregnant. So, I put the boat up for sale and started looking at houses. I was gonna be a professor and profess. No, I didn't care, I mean, I was done with the wild. I wanted the adventure at home. And the baby was a week old when she died. And the heart... It was a heart defect. She couldn't... Her name was Alice. Anyway, l... It just, sort of, felt like the end of dreaming, you know? Tess found her way again. Strongest woman in the world. I wasn't doing so well. And Tess saw it before I did, and she canceled the sale of the boat. Got us back out into the world. And she started filming, more for something to do, really, you know, than anything else. And then she cut it all together, she submitted it to a local affiliate. "Let the world see how you see the world." So I started talking to a camera. And just without realizing it, I became myself again. Dr. Emmet Cole. It was a year later we had Lincoln. Now these cameras, they gave me a second shot at life. Made the world ourfamily. RABBlT: There's magic out there. There sure as hell was. (WlND WHlSTLlNG TUNE) (SALSA BARKlNG) This way, find some cover! Manny! Manny! In here! Get in here! Stay low! Get in, get in! Stay low. (RABBlT PANTlNG) RABBlT: Is it gone? I don't know. Manny? Manny? - Manny! - Manny! Manny! Manny! Manny! Manny? Oh, no, no, no, no. (SCREAMlNG) No! Manny! (RABBlT SCREAMlNG) Come on! Come on! (WlND HOWLlNG) Get in here! Get in here! You gotta do something! You gotta do something! I don't know what the hell to do! You gotta do something! Please! Make it stop! Just be quiet. I can't even think. That song's in my head! Oh, God. Oh, God, I'm so scared! - Manny was just... - (EMMET WHlSTLlNG) I'm so scared. Please, God! Please, make it stop! (WlND STOPS HOWLlNG) (BOTH PANTlNG) - You did it. - That's it! You stopped it! Whistling back. The spirit is a riddle to solve, that's it. We solved it. It wants to be answered. We passed the test. We can go, we can get there. I don't want to get there! I want to go home, Emmet. Manny's dead! I know. That's just part of the test. It's all tests. Russ was right. You don't even see it. You need to trust me, Rabbit. You need to trust me. We can do this. Okay. We can do this. EMMET: Rabbit, look at this. Breakfast. Palm fruit. Rabbit? Rabbit? "I'm sorry"? You took my pack? All the gear? What... What did you leave me, Rabbit? Inventory. Cameras. Batteries. Solar charger. Solar radio. Pen knife. Note. No tent, no bedding, no water filter. Sat phone. So, not good. Rabbit took the survival gear for herself and turned back. I can't do that. Just gotta keep going. 80 kilometers to the Falls. I can make maybe five clicks a day. In this climate, that's about 2,400 calories a day. So I gotta gather what I can. But at least I have the cameras. I mean... I could always... I could survive anything as long as I just kept working, doing the show. So that's what I'll keep doing. Keep talking, keep talking, keep talking, stay focused. There's magic out there. Let's go see. Graviola. Good for killing parasites. Been tested for cancer-fighting properties. White trillium. Good for snake bites. More markings. Xulos. (WHlSPERS) On the right path. (WlND WHlSTLlNG TUNE) (WHlSTLlNG) (WlND STOPS WHlSTLlNG) Okay. No tent. The ants are gonna be on me any minute so the best I can hope for is to get this fire going, and get some coverfrom the smoke. Maybe get dry. I'd take feeling dry for five minutes over a steak right now. This is too wet. It's just too wet. I could die out here if I don't get a fire lit. (SlGHS) Die out here. What am I doing? What am I doing? (EMMET SlGHS) (BRANCH SNAPS) (SALSA WHlNlNG) (CHUCKLES) Hey! Salsa! Some good news. Am I glad to see you! I needed a friend. Come here. Well, things aren't going so well. No food. No fire. No fire. Promise me you won't freak out, okay? (HUMMlNG) (RADlO PLAYlNG) "And the good Lord said, light is not enough. "Let them have love too." Leave that one in will you, Clark? We're gonna be okay, kid. We'll be all right. This is suri grub. High fat content. Here you go. Hey, we live here now, pal. Don't be picky. I'm hungry too, you know. They don't get how important this expedition is. You get it, don't you? There's life, death. But out here there's that third option. What if death was never meant to be final? What if it's more like a window? Except that that window is open out here. Would like to see Alice again. Would like to have gotten to know her. She had Tess' eyes. They were that bright, you could tell already, you know? (BREATHlNG HEAVlLY) It feels like I'm on fire. Fever. My stomach is just... (SlGHS) It's just careless drinking river water. Probably leptospirosis. So I can collect Sangre de Drago and try and treat it, but that's energy I'd rather spend gathering food. If I'm gonna make it 70 kilometers, I'm gonna need to find some calories somewhere. Or I just won't. Okay, come on, let's go. (BREATHlNG HEAVlLY) (DlALlNG) LlNCOLN: Hello? Lincoln, hey, hi. God, it's good to hear you. Hello? Who is this? I can't hear anything. Hello? Lincoln, it's me, it's Dad. He called me. I mean, that was the last time I spoke to him. Dad? Where are you? I thought you were off the map for a few months. Well, I was just, uh, missing you and... Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there! How's everything going on the new show? Oh, well, you know, I mean, you know how it is. It's... We hit a few snags. You think everything is gonna be wonderful and... Well, nothing is ever wonderful. Look, I gotta go. I'm giving my first big hall lecture. Epigenetics. Yeah, no... Yeah, I know. You're busy. I wish I could be there. What? I can't hear you. Yeah, I'll be right there! I can barely hear you, but I've got to go, okay? Okay. Okay, Lincoln. Okay. (STATlC) I'm sorry. (SlGHS HEAVlLY) One day, I would meet a child who is strong enough. I would know the one when I saw him. And when I did, I should give him this. Dad gave me this symbol because he thought I was special. I wasn't even there when he needed me. I wasn't gonna pick it up. When he called, I saw his number and I had that thing in my stomach I'd get when it'd come up. I always knew there was gonna be a fight on the other end of that phone. Right now, being back here, all I can remember are the good times. Sitting on his lap, letting me steer. He would have been better off if I didn't pick up. (WHlSPERS) Marked. What the hell is that? (BUZZlNG) Listen, Tess, I haven't had a chance to watch this. Do you want me to look through it before you see it just to make sure? No. Ninety-two, ninety-three. Ninety-five, six. There's a lot of stars. The Chumash lndians say, "The stars are the holes poked in the blanket over the sky "when the birds were trying to escape capture by flying to the moon." Forty-six. Sleep too long and the whistling starts again. Already in starvation response. They say that at some point the hunger subsides. I keep waiting for that. (WlND WHlSTLlNG TUNE) (WHlSTLlNG) Mangoes. There's a tree full of mango. (GROANS) Oh! Ah, no! No! (GROANS) Well, the ankle's broken. Just can't put any weight on it. There's no making it to the Falls. Best I can hope for is make my way to the river, hope for a fishing village. And I can make it. (PANTlNG) (SALSA BARKS) I'm giving it everything. Not enough. I can't go any further. I can't make it without food. Or I can't get food. No, I can't. I can't... I can't. That's... (VOlCE BREAKlNG) I don't want to die. Good boy. Good boy. I'm sorry. Good boy, good boy. I'm sorry. I need to see them again and l... This is... This is the... Good boy, good boy. No, no, I can't! (GROANS) Tess. My God, I should have never have left. I should never have left. I had a beautiful life. I just threw it away. (EMMET CRYlNG) Tess? (WHlSPERS) Forgive me. (WlND WHlSTLlNG TUNE) What's he doing? Why isn't he whistling back? TESS: Because he can't. (BUTTON CLlCKS) I need to see this alone. Could you all please leave? Come on, let's go. Mom, whatever happens... (BUTTON CLlCKS) (WlND WHlSTLlNG TUNE) (PEOPLE WHlSTLlNG TUNE) (SHUDDERED BREATHlNG) (ENGlNE RUMBLlNG) WOMAN: Hey, I think someone's out there! Send for help! (STATlC) No! No, no. Wait! He's alive! He's in an outpost somewhere. He's there! We can find him! Mom, you good? Yeah, let's go. LENA: I'm coming with you. No, you don't have to. Yes, I do. There! It should be this way. Those are definitely the mountains. We're on the right path. Here you go. (DOG BARKlNG) Oh, my God! Salsa! Hey! - Hey, boy! - Salsa, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, where's he going? This is the place? Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're sure this the right place? Well, you saw the tapes. This is where they dropped him off. Your father was left in front of an outpost full of people. We saw him on the tapes. He was here. Those tapes are at least a few months old. Anything could have happened since then. Where is everyone?
