 The River (2012): Season 1, Episode 2 - Marbeley - full transcript 
 When the spirit of Dr. Emmet Cole mysteriously enters Jahel, the message is clear: go home! Instead, Tess determines to go into the jungle to find clues to Cole's whereabouts. While on their mission, they discover a tree draped in children's dolls that they suspect is there to ward off the "spirit of the abandoned girl" who drowned in the river. Then, when a member of the crew goes missing, the group realize they'll have to endure a nightmare in order to appease an angry spirit and get their loved one back.

 (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, mate! - Oh, bollocks! We need a new camera operator. Well, the last one got his head taken off by a ghost, so good luck with that. AJ: Hey, Jahel. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) You're really not gonna learn English ever, are you? Yeah. Emmet's journal says that he and my dad were right there. But when? A month ago, a year ago? Before or after they went missing? We need to know where they were last. We need to establish a timeline. What about Emmet's tapes? He shot so much footage here. If we could tie him visually to a location... We've been trying, Mom, but there's 104 tapes, and there's no way to put them in any kind of order. About a month before I lost contact with Emmet, he told me that he had a bug bite on his thumb that got infected. He couldn't get rid of it. He asked me to research some sort of medical treatment. Well, how does that help us? We track the bite on the tapes. The worse the infection, the later the date. It could give us some sort of direction. One of the strays swam up. He's refusing to leave the boat. The camera. Yeah. Put the next one in. Okay, wait. Okay, look at the bite there. It's fresh. So that means that this tape must be from earlier. Put the next one in. Look. See how bad the infection is? - Mmm-hmm. - So this tape must be more recent. LlNCOLN: Yeah, so Dad's tapes. So far we got eight possible sites, but any one of them could be his last recording. It's more than we had this morning. Pick one and we'll start there. It could be dangerous. We should warn the crew. Everyone on this boat has been to the Amazon before. Well, they haven't been here, to the Boi?na. Hell, according to every map ever made, this place doesn't even exist. Come on, anyone who doesn't want to stay, we should let them go. CLARK: Excuse me. Here's the reality, Lincoln. You let Kurt go, who's gonna protect us? Emilio and his daughter, they keep the ship running. Everyone is on this boat because we need them to find Emmet. You let any one of them go, you're letting your father go, too. (BREATHlNG DEEPLY) Tess... (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (DlSTORTED) You shouldn't have come here. (lN SPANlSH) Not Jahel. It's not Jahel. Emmet? Can't be you. (BOTH BREATHlNG HEAVlLY) Tess, you need to let me go. What? They have me, Tess. We're not leaving you. Who has you? This place, I shouldn't have come. Save yourselves. Take Lincoln and go. Emmet! Emmet! Emmet! Emmet! Lincoln! TESS: It was him. - CLARK: Tess. - I know my husband. Sometimes when we want something badly enough, we can imagine that... I did not imagine this. Emilio, has Jahel ever done anything like this before? No. So, if somehow, that was your husband, maybe you should listen to him. Turn around. Go home. If it was someone you loved, could you just leave them alone to die? Yes. And I have. Well, I'm not going to. Emmet gave us a lead. He said, "They have me." LlNCOLN: Mom, who's "they"? We don't even know who that is. Who has him? LENA: Wait a minute. In all of Emmet's last tapes, it shows him alone with his crew, except for one. In it, he's in the mountains, talking to some kind of local militia. Pull up that tape. Let's find what piece of jungle these guys call home. All I need is a direction. Clark, get your cameras ready. We're gonna rescue Emmet Cole today. Just so we're clear, a little girl who talks to ghosts says, "Don't go." And we're going. Yeah. Emilio? If Emmet... If Jahel says anything else, you radio me. - (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) - Actually, a better idea, film it. Come on. CLARK: AJ, grab the camera. Let's go. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. CLARK: So you really think that that was Emmet channeling through Jahel? I know it was. You should put the camera down and watch where you're walking, Clark. You forget I did start life out as a camera operator... Ow! Yeah, it's all right, carry on, carry on. Emmet's alive. And we're gonna find him. And if we do, what's the first thing you're gonna say to him? - I'm gonna tell him I'm sorry. - What are you talking about? He's the one that left you to go on this insane quest to find magic. - Shouldn't he be the one to apologize? - Hey. TESS: It's all right, Lincoln. Clark is incapable of asking a question without trying to get a rise. Yes, Emmet left me. We've all done things we regret. I know I have. Thanks. You and my dad, you talked a lot. Just when he needed help. Research, technical support. Or medical help. Here we go. Is that why you're pissed at me? - I'm not pissed at you. I'm... - Yes, you are. No, I'm not. You're pissed because instead of coming to his son who graduated medical school, he came to me. He had a question and I was there. There's something to that, you know. Being there when people need you. AJ: Be right back. Don't separate. Stay with the group. I got business. Don't take too well to company. Sorry, mate. He and I need to talk. AJ: Hold on. You're not jungle. Guys! CLARK: Why would there be a graveyard out here? I thought the locals didn't bury in the ground. They don't. CLARK: Wow, what is this? "Sir Henry Nevins, hero to the Crown." It seems like Sir Nevins and l are both a long way from home. TESS: "Tree that weeps." British colonial rubber barons came over in the 19th century. Devastated the rainforests, slaughtered the natives if they didn't work them to death. Made a fortune. That's what they called playing hero. (LlNCOLN SHUSHlNG) (GHOSTLY LAUGHTER) LlNCOLN: Did you hear something? It's coming from this way. Go! Wait. Hey! What's that? Is that... Is that a child? Hello? Hello? Honey? Hello? (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (WHlMPERlNG) Hey. Hi. (SHRlEKlNG) (CHlTTERlNG) (BLEEP) How the (BLEEP) does a monkey get a doll's head out here? I think I can see how. Oh, (BLEEP). I've heard about places like these. They're called spirit trees. When locals believe that the woods are home to a spirit, they sometimes leave gifts. CLARK: Why dolls? LENA: This is a graveyard. Mom? What is it? Did you find something? Oh, my God. LlNCOLN: That's my bear, Marbeley. How? Emmet. He must have been here. He must have put the bear in that tree. We picked the right trail. He must be close. Sun's going down. We have to camp here for the night. Here? With all the dolls? Oh, yes, please. AJ, let's set up some cameras. Let's mine this gold, okay? High angles from the top... Tree shots, way ahead of you. Wait, no, no. We can't stay here. If we press on, we could find Emmet by morning. At night out here, the only thing you'll find are ways to get killed. We'll pick up his trail in the morning. This is not an option. How many have you got set up? One, two... - Where else? Show me. - ...three, four, five, six. (RUMBLlNG) - Thanks. - Mmm-hmm. - You okay? - Yeah. CLARK: Think we're gonna find Emmet tomorrow? Or at all? Clark, you've been on me all day. Would you just give it a rest? I just... Just a quick question. - Give me a quick one, then. - What do you mean? Come on, give it to me, give it to me. Pass it over. - Don't handle the camera like that! - Hang on. - You focus? - Yeah, hang on. - Don't fuss with me, come on. - Just fix your hair. All right, then. What about you? What are you doing here in the middle of the jungle looking for Emmet? Hmm. That's a good question. And do you really care if we find him? Wow, I forget how little you think of me sometimes. Here's the deal, everybody always thought that Emmet and I hated each other, you know? I mean, it's probably 'cause we spent so much time arguing over every last frame of the show, but, you know... The thing with him is that he... What he never got was that, the show, this whole thing? It wasn't about adventure or magic. It was about product, right? Well, he was, uh... He's incorruptible, wasn't he? I do love that about him. Here, give it back to me, then. Give it back to me. Now then, back to the real job. Good night, Clark. Night, Tess. - Hey, Lincoln? - Hey. Long ago, when I was hiking in Mali, I met a man high up on the Bandiagara Cliffs. A shaman who was old as the hills and said he would never die, and he said to me, "Life and death are the same. "Like a weight on a clock that swings back and forth. "Tick to tock." And then he said the clock was getting very old and was waiting for someone strong enough to cut the weight and stop the swing. And all the time he's telling me this, his old wife, who's also old as the hills and would never ever die was making this. And she gave it to me, and she said that one day I would meet a child who was strong enough. To do what? Well, that's for the child to know. My place in things was that I would know the one when I saw him. And when I did, I should give him this. What if I lose it? We never lose the things that matter. Look, I'm sorry. You know, it's just my dad and l, we barely spoke the year before he went missing. My mom had no idea what he was up to. But you, you knew everything he was doing. Not everything. Marbeley. I remember this guy. You used to carry him everywhere. Yeah. We'd, uh, watched A Christmas Carol. Jacob Marley was my favorite part. So, Marbeley. First ghost you ever saw. Yeah. I thought you lost him years ago. I did. When I was 16, I pitched him into the lndian Ocean and I swore I'd never set foot on the Magus again. Next day I left for boarding school. Bit dramatic in retrospect. Your dad must've gotten it back. Or the doll tree has friends in Sumatra. You know, when I was a little kid, my whole life was this bear. And my dad, you know, he made me feel Iike I was the only thing in the whole world that mattered, you know. Like I was the light in his life. And one day that light went off. I don't know why but nothing I could do would flick it back on again, you know. I mean, I knew he loved me, but whatever quest he was on, I wasn't on the map. I know that you think there's some reason that he came to me instead of you or your mom, but... I... I think he was just trying to protect you. He knew what he was doing out here. That he'd be inviting in darkness. He wouldn't ever risk exposing you or Tess to that. But me? He could risk me. AJ: All these dolls. I can't sleep. Ah... Actually, you're a good one. You're like Jane Austen's binky, aren't you? All right, well, it's just you and me, bink. So, just open those eyes for me. Do it on camera, just once and that would be fantastic. Yeah? Please, for Uncle AJ, yeah? Come on. Any of you spirits out there. I dare you. Open that doll's eyes. Go ahead, bet you can't. God, you're boring me now. Go on, do it. (YAWNlNG) I'm going to bed. I'm going to bed. (SCREAMS) Lincoln? - Lincoln? - LlNCOLN: Get off me! - What is it? What happened? - Who grabbed me? Grabbed? Everyone was sleeping. Then how the hell did I end up over here? God, it's... KURT: Where are you going? Anywhere but here. We're all leaving, now. You won't survive at night in the jungle. Yeah? Stop us. KURT: This way. Let's go. - Watch that rock. - LENA: Yeah. CLARK: It's just a stream, don't worry about it. (TESS SCREAMS) Something grabbed me! - LlNCOLN: Give me your hand. - Help me! It won't let go! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! AJ: Clark, grab the camera. Get her out of there! Pull! Grab her! CLARK: AJ, AJ, camera. LENA: Are you okay? (GASPlNG) (GROANlNG) Okay. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) They won't. I know what's out there. I have to protect them. From what? - (GROANlNG) - Jahel. Something... Someone was grabbing me. CLARK: Okay, so what you're saying, then, is that someone is in this stream, in what, less than half a foot of water? Are you sure? AJ: Easy on the lady, Clark. I saw a hand grab her. Stay out of this, please, AJ. I see a dead hand reaching out of the ground, I'm damn well staying in it. I mean, we both pulled her out. What do you think happened? Like I said, thank you. Wait, I remember when we used to sit around the campfire and Emmet, he'd tell stories, legends, from wherever we were. And there's this one from the Amazon, La Dejada, The Abandoned One. - Do you remember? - Uh-uh. There's a little girl from far away whose mother is too busy for her. So she plays by herself in the forest. One day, her doll falls in the river. Her mother isn't there to help her, so, she goes in by herself to try to get it but she falls in and drowns. They never find her body, they can't even bury her. They say her spirit gets lonely, so she brings people to the river to drown. So many people died, locals began leaving her gifts so she'd leave them alone. Maybe this tree is for her. She must have been from one of the old British colonial families. Well, that explains the dolls. But why is it coming after us? LlNCOLN: I don't know. You took this from the tree? Come on, man. It's hard enough to believe there's a ghost out here, but one that's mad we took its toys? Please. (GlRL WHlMPERlNG) Give it back. I can't believe I'm doing this. Lincoln. Okay, I'm sorry I took my bear. There, are you happy now? I think we're all past a good night's sleep. Sun's coming up soon. Let's pick up your husband's trail. (RUSTLlNG) Put it back. Tie it carefully. I did. Do it again. Sorry. (GASPS) Give me the bear. (SCREAMS) What do you want from us? FEMALE AUTOMATED VOlCE: Mommy. KURT: This way! Go, go! LlNCOLN: Come on! - KURT: We can make it to the Magus. - Go! KURT: It's this way! CLARK: Move as fast as you can, fast as you can. To the left! - Hurry! We're close. Get out of here. - LlNCOLN: Hurry! Come on, Mom. Go! KURT: Run! Stick together! (GlRL CACKLlNG) GlRL: Mommy. CLARK: Stick together, guys. Come on! - Mommy. - (GlRL GlGGLlNG) KURT: We're almost at the Magus. Go, go! Come on! The doll tree? You, you led us right back here? We were going the right way. What, so the tree brought us back here? Huh? Come on! (CHlLD GlGGLlNG) It did this. It's trying to trap us here. What does it want from us? I think it's pretty clear. Where's my mom? She was right behind me. She's not here. - CLARK: Tess! - Tess? - CLARK: Tess! - LENA: Tess! - Mom! - AJ: Where is she? - Mom! - LENA: Tess! - Where is she? Who saw her... Who... - Tess! - Mom! - Tess? KURT: Tess? She was right here. LENA: Tess? KURT: She was right here. Tess? - Tess! - LlNCOLN: Where is she? - KURT: It's to our left. - (TESS SCREAMlNG) LlNCOLN: Hold on! Mom! LENA: Tess! - LENA: Tess! - CLARK: Tess! - LENA: Tess! - Mom! She was right here. - CLARK: I can't see anything! - LENA: Can you hear us? LlNCOLN: Where is she? She's in here somewhere! KURT: We all saw her drown. - She's in here. - LENA: I know I heard her voice. AJ: Over here! - Keep looking. - TESS: (lN GHOSTLY VOlCE) Lincoln! - LENA: Tess! - Mom! - Oh, my God! Did you hear that? - Lincoln! - Yeah. - (lN SlNG-SONG) Lincoln! - Tess? - Mom! - AJ: Is that... That's Tess! - Where the hell is she? - CLARK: Tess! - Mom! Lincoln. LENA: Where are you? - Lincoln! - (GlRL SOBBlNG) Where the hell is she? - Wait. - Mom! Lincoln! Okay, wait. Listen to her voice. It sounds like they're in the same place. - Lincoln! - But where, where, where? It doesn't matter. If she can take my mom, she can give her back. How do we get her to do that? We give her what she really wants. AJ: You've got to be kidding me. If she wants her mother, we'll give her her mother. CLARK: Just keep looking, okay? Just look! LlNCOLN: What the hell is this? CLARK: Here. That's Nevins. - There's one here. - AJ: Is that it? KURT: No, no, no, no, no. This isn't the mother. CLARK: Here, now, I got something here, I got something here. Here we go. Here we go. What's this one? "Taken by the... Taken by the river." - It's her. - That's her, isn't it? - That's the daughter. - Where's the mother? Where's... What's it say? What's it say? LENA: "Her heart broke when love drowned." That's the mother. Watch it. Let's shine some light. We gotta get in there, guys. No, there's still more to go. More shovel, more shovel! Come on! On your side. CLARK: I've got something. Move. - There it is. Stay back. - Okay. Please. Give her back. You have your mother. I brought her to you. Now give me mine. Come on! Give her back! Give her back! I mean, how could she just disappear like that? I mean, she was right here. And now she's dead. I mean, it's this place, it's taken them both. It's a (BLEEP) nightmare. We shouldn't be here. We should never have come. Now they're both gone. We should never have come. You're not alone. (GASPlNG) TESS: (SOBBlNG) Lincoln. Lincoln! - Someone. - Mom! - Lincoln! - Mom! Mom! Mom! Lincoln. I couldn't breathe. I almost drowned! - Oh, my God! - It's all right. LlNCOLN: Let me look at you. Are you hurt? Let me see. Let me see, keep a light on her. Look at me. Here. You okay? You need to talk to her. About what? We got lucky with her. We might not be with your father. We might be too late. Jahel? Dad? Dad, if you're still there, I know you can't be, but if you are, I just want you to know, I understand. There's a whole world of things out there that I never knew. And they're just terrifying. But you knew. Maybe you were just trying to protect me all that time, and now it's my turn to protect you. We're here for you. If you're still out there, if there's a chance you're still alive, then you... Dad, Dad, can you hear me? Please, Dad, if you're there, if you're anywhere, you just tell me and I will find you. (COUGHS) (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (SHUSHlNG) It's okay, it's okay. EMMET: That one day I would meet a child who was strong enough. So how was your day? (BOTH LAUGHlNG) (BOTH LAUGHlNG) EMMET: Hey, Russ, this auto focus is acting up again. It's just... I guess it's the humidity. Good God, these kids are gonna end up getting married some day. Lena?
