 You get that? There's a finless porpoise that swam right up to me. Tell me you got it. - Yes, we got it. - Got it, dad. Lincoln, how great was that? Did you see it? Yes. Got it? There is magic out there. We're filming a species that perhaps no one has ever seen before. Lincoln, come here. All right, okay, cut. (Man) Cut. (Beep) We'll see you next week, I hope.

 Emmet Cole has been reported missing. He was a wonderful character. He was a passionate environmentalist. Cole and his documentary crew were last seen on the Amazon onboard their ship the "Magus." (Man) Rescue teams have searched the Amazon for weeks, but with no sign. (Man) And his death is tonight being mourned around the world. As a kid, I used to watch my father on TV, and the voice would come up, "next week, Emmet Cole may not survive what he finds in the cave." I'd be terrified he wouldn't come home. He always did. Well, today... We give up hope. Thanks for joining us on "The Undiscovered Country." I'm Emmet Cole. We'll see you next week. (Thud) (Horns honking) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's get that mike fixed, shall we? We shouldn't be doing this to him. Yet here we are. He's my son. ? Tequila. That's your dad's drink. Yeah, it's his day. Why are they following you? Come on, guys. Enough with the cameras. I just buried my father. You didn't bury him. Mom, we said good-bye, okay? We let go. Why weren't you there? 'Cause he's not dead. We've had this conversation, okay? He's legally dead. He's actually dead. I wish he wasn't, but he is. Lincoln-- Mom, I'm fine. You know what? I've gotten pretty used to him being gone. I had a lot of practice waiting for him to come back from Kenya or Peru for my birthday, my graduation. I mean, you were there, right? You'd bake a cake and you'd tell me not to be sad because dad was here in spirit. So you know what? To me, this just feels like another birthday. This is different. They found his beacon. 4:08 P.M. yesterday. The emergency signal-- His personal frequency. (Whispers) After six months. That doesn't mean that that-- I mean, that could be anything, right? Well, it could be him. We can find his ship. We can find him. I need you to come with me, Lincoln. No, no, mom, listen to me. Look, I'm going back to school in a week, okay? I start my residency in Chicago. They accepted my research. I can finish my PhD. You never know. I might even make you proud. Lincoln, wait. Wait. Your father needs you. No. I gave enough to him, to that show. He missed my life to inspire a billion people I could give a fuck about. There's no magic out there. I'm not going. I'm not getting involved. They won't pay if you don't go. The network says it's both of us or no show. That's the deal. We pay for the expedition for as long as it takes to find him, but we get full, unfettered access to both of you. They know dad and I hated each other. That's why we want you. Clark. Please. Angel. Come with me. (Clark) So, Lincoln, tell us about your relationship with your father. (Clatter) Go fuck yourself. (Scoffs) He'll come around. (Whirring) Hi there. I'm on the Amazon. Not a lot of other Jews out here, though. There's a storm coming out of Tefe. Don't throw up. (Bottles clink) (Pats leg) (Beeping) 100 kilometers. We're close. (Spanish accent) This is not a ship. This is a boat. The "Magus"-- She is a ship. I sail her for Doc 23 years. (Chuckles) A year ago, Doc is fueling up for the Amazonas, and he says to me, "Emilio, you no go on this trip. Go home." I say, "Doc... fuck you. This is my home." Now I understand. He wanted to protect me. (Clark) But it was just another expedition, right? Why did he want to protect you? Because of my daughter. God hates me. I know. Or he would have made her ugly. (Metal clanking) (Sammy) Hello there. Hola. So you can-- You can fix things? Esos no son los zapatos adecuados. S?. Uh, je m'apelle Sammy. Escuelas americanas. (Tess) So we have to watch out for the sand. So when's high tide? It's about 4:42. That's four hours. (Thud) (Shouting indistinctly) Uhh! Uhh! (Grunting) Oh! Uhh! Caught him touching my guns. Where we're headed, there may be 20 people in the world... (Click) That can say I've seen worse and not be lying to get laid. (Click) People like Mrs. Cole-- They don't know how lucky they are they hired me. (Tess) Stop the boat! We found the beacon! It's here! Get in there. Get in there, get in there, get in there. (Laughs) (Beeping) - Here we go, here we go. - Okay, where is it? 15 meters, right up here. On the left. Okay, stop it! Stop. (Rapid beeping) (Continuous tone) Where is it? It's here. All I got is river. Okay. If it's here, it's under the water. (Continuous tone) It's here. I know, but if it's here, it's under the water. (Metal clanking) (Steady beeping) (Sighs) His beacon. I'm sorry. Well, we don't know if he was in there. We don't know he was in there. Someone turned the signal on. Someone-- Emmet-- wants our help. The door-- The way it is broken, something not try to break in. Something... break out. We got what we came for, mom. We have an answer. Come on. Let's just go home. No. We keep going. We don't even have a direction. I'll find one. (Crowd shouting indistinctly in distance) (Shouting continues) (Screaming and laughing) Medico. S?, le duele. - Mm. ?Te duele? - S?. Esp?rate, ya est?. ?Bueno aqu?, se?or? Very strong. It's good. (Whirring) Lena, you shouldn't be here. You shouldn't be here. Lena... No. I modeled tide patterns from the beacon's location. I came up with six probables, and the first five were empty, but this was the sixth. Here. 55 kilometers west. Look. (Beep) There's nothing there, Lena. There's no river for the boat to be on. It's not on the map. It doesn't exist. I'm telling you, a boat doesn't just disappear. It's there. It has to be, and they will be there-- My dad and Emmet. It's the only possible place. Then we go there. Tell the crew. No. Eso es la Boi?na. No podemos ir para all?. Tell the crew. Up here on the left. (Animals screeching and chittering) I thought for sure I'd hear from you at some point after they went missing. Sorry. Just school. The lab. That all sounds rather boring-- I mean, compared to your father's work. Yeah, well, that's the point, Clark. Science isn't a great, big wonder anymore. Discoveries are made in a lab, not the jungle. (Wings flapping loudly) Okay, that was pretty cool. That's her. (Motor whirring) Hello? (Tess) Emmet?! Dad?! Hello?! Is anyone here? (Metal groaning loudly, banging) What the hell was... Hello?! (Metal groaning continues) That was from inside. Someone's in the ship. (Switch clicks) (Kurt) Emilio! (Emilio) Hey. Get the gennie running. We need some lights. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. (Panting) (Clank) (Bang) (Creak and bang) (Bang in distance) (Bang grows louder) (Gasps) Hello? Is anyone here? (Metal groaning in distance) It's coming from the panic room. Go, go, go, let's go. Come on. Move. We made the safe into a panic room in case of hijackers. Emmet, is that you? Listen to me. I'm here! They can be in there. Open it. (Clark) It closes from the inside. Yeah, well, it's welded shut from the outside - all the way around. (Sammy) - Why would somebody do that? (Panting) Emmet. (Clank in distance) I'm gonna get you out, all right? Emmet? I'm gonna get you out. I'm here. (Whirring) (Clark) Okay, what have we got? Look at the state of this place. - Yeah, it's not pretty, is it? - Oh, my God. (Gasps) (Speaks indistinctly) (Clank, electricity powers up) That's-- that's good. Power's back on. (Switch clicks) (Electricity humming, switches clicking) Oh, good. (Beep) Ship's cameras back up. Can you believe it? That's very nice. AJ, can you stop farting around, please? Get the rest of it. I want every inch of this boat covered, all right? And we might even get a view into the panic room. And get the editing bay up live, too. We can log it all. We can cut as we go, all right?? Now please, excuse me. (Beep, switch clicks) Trying to make a TV show. (Click) (Sighs) - It's working. It's working. It's very nice. AJ. - Yeah? We're in business. (AJ) Come on. Lovely. (Whirring) No deber?an de abrirlo, pap?. (Switch clicks) (Sighs) (Crying) Well, people always tell me that the reason they loved Emmet's show was not because of the travel or the adventure but because they wanted to be part of our own perfect little family. I mean, yeah, we had our problems. Everybody does, sure. Our secrets. But... who doesn't? (Whirs) We're in. (Clank) (Strained voice) Go on. Pull it. (Metal creaking) (Grunts) Get it! (Creaking) Ohh! Ohh. (Coughs) (Clicks) Hello? (Tess) Oh, my God. Dad? (Sammy) What is that? (Tess sighs) Lincoln, no! (Grunts) Aah! Uhh! (Whooshing) (Gunshots) (Clark) Bloody hell! (Tess gasping) (Whooshing, banging) (Panting and exhaling deeply) (Growling and screeching) (Rustling) What the fuck was that? One night, Jahel-- She come to me. I'm upstairs playing cards with Doc. And she said to me, "papa, come. Ghost friend-- Tell him to be quiet." I think it's one of the new crew is bothering my daughter, so I go get my gun. I say, um, "which man is it?" She said, "no, no es man. Es ghost friend. Tell him to be quiet, papi." So I say, "ghost friend, be quiet." Couple of days go by, and I ask her if these voices are still bothering her, and she say, "no. No bother. Ghost friend talk more quiet now." No me gusta este amigo fantasma. No! No! (Hyperventilating) We need to keep pressure on that. - You're gonna be okay. - Put your arm around her. - It's okay. - Put your arm around her. Come on. AJ, get the medkit. She's bleeding! Put the damn camera down and get the kit! (Crying) Mm. (Exhales deeply) That's it. Just breathe in. (Exhales deeply) You're okay. You're okay. One more. (Clatters) How bad is it? Well, know how you used to think scars were sexy? You're about to be much sexier. (Chuckles) Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek on this boat? And you could never find me. I mean, typical, right? (Laughs) I used to try and camo myself, and that one time I picked the wrong vine. (Laughs) And I got covered in hives. (Sighs) And you didn't come near me for, like, a week. No way. You thought I looked like the boogeyman. You did. And you know I had it all over my face. That was kinda funny. (Chuckles) You remember what my dad said? - What'd he say? - He said you're trouble. Well... There may be something to that. Hey, AJ. Yeah. Thanks for the help, man. She was hurt. What, you think I'm a fireman? I don't save people, man. (Grunts) (Thud) (Grunts) (Panting) Hell with him. I got the shot. No excrement. That was no animal. What is this? Some kind of shrine or something? They left the food out. Who's that? (Gasps) (Clatter) - Holy cow, you scared me. - No me gusta being scared, little girl. Sangre. These mean anything to anyone? Yeah, these are pictures of cam Travers, one of our producers. Emmet insisted on bringing him on this one instead of me. (Scoffs) He was a son of a bitch. The only decent thing about him was his wife. You think Travers is dead? Before they went missing, Emmet said that Travers caught a fever and that he didn't make it. They buried him out here. You spoke to Emmet? From here? He just had some questions about how to back up files. He was always afraid of a server crash. (Switch clicks) (Pants) (Creaks) (Creaking) Emilio, all that time you sailed with my father, you ever see anything like that? Any idea what it could be? Before he fired me, your father started to spend a lot of nights off of the ship, all night, by himself. No food, no gear. I told Doc I start to worry about him. He said, "don't." He's protected. By a gun? By magic. Pap?, ?l no cree. Cu?ntale. Mira. Sangre. Wh-- (Silverware clatters) - C?llate, ni?a. - What's she saying? You know what that thing was? It's okay. You can tell me. It's okay. No es un animal. Es Corpo Seco. It was not an animal. (Speaking Spanish) It was Corpo Seco. The dry spirit. A soul so bitter, the ground would not take him. And the devil sent him back, so he wanders, looking for blood to make it whole. More blood, more strength. (Scoffs) Well, are you talking about some kind of ghost? (Sighs) El f?retro del ni?o. Coffin for the child. This is kraho, from the chonta palm. Full of tsarutuma. Holy. The shamans use it to catch the angry soul. Your father used blood to lure the spirit. They caught it inside, but we opened it. ...Sangre de Lena. (Continues in Spanish) We fed it with Lena's blood. Now it's strong enough. To what? (Clank) Hey. We're going right now. Pack what you need. Everyone on the rafts. Well, hang on a minute. What are you talking about? We're not safe. Someone's out there. I don't know if it's an animal or a guy on drugs or just the fucking crew's on drugs. But people died here, and we could be next. I am not leaving this close to finding your father. Someone welded the door shut. Someone survived. You're captain here. It's your call. I already lost my father to this place. I'm not losing the two of you. Let's go home. (Lena) Out here! Out here! The rafts! Lincoln, I don't know what happened. I came out to see if they were okay, and someone must have slashed them or something. There's no way to fix that. Where's the other one? (Lincoln) What? - Over there! (Lena) - Can we get it? No, the current's got it. It's long gone. - Did you do this? Huh? - What? - Of course I didn't. - Then who did? I have no-- (Low growl in distance) (Rustling) (Growling) (Sighs) No nos va a dejar irnos. Hasta que no tenga la sangre suficiente. (Lincoln) We gotta get the hell outta here. (Clark) We don't know what that is, okay? We don't know. And we don't have any way to leave, so... (Scoffs) Yes, we do. This. The "Magus." Emilio, how long to get us moving? I gotta get one of our engines working. I have to reattach the rudder line. I have to reseal the hull. Two days. All right, you got two and a half hours. Just work the engine. Keep us alive long enough to fix the rest, okay? We gotta be moving by 4:43. - And what happens then? - High tide. (Scoffs) Look, we get one chance to shove her out. I'll clear the propeller. Everyone else, eyes open. You might need this. He's starting to sound like his father. Pap?. (Grunting) (Screeching) (Gasping) This place-- It gets to you. You know, everything I've ever studied tells me we're all caught up in group hysteria. But what we saw, what hurt you... If that's anything other, if that's something unnatural, we need to know more, or we're not gonna make it. (Exhales deeply) (Grunting) Nature's just disgusting. Lincoln... (Pants) There's something you need to see. (Creaks) Emmet made me promise that if anything ever happened to him, I was supposed to find these tapes and destroy them, but... there might be something on these that could help us. This is his journal. These are the originals. He sent me backups, all encoded, so I don't know what's on them, but... what he told me. (Gasps) (Emmet speaks indistinctly) (Drums beating) (Chanting in native language) (Water splashing) (Emmet laughing) (Clatter) (Static) (Men continue chanting) (Man screams) (Gasps) (Panting) The engine's dead. It's killed half the crew. There are four of us left. Corpo Seco. It's cam Travers. I know it's impossible. We buried him. (Panting) It's this place. It's trying to kill us. So he thought that ghost was one of their own crew? This cam Travers-- He killed them. Now... he's coming after us? The kraho carve these-- these soul traps, and Landry and I are gonna try and just draw it in. It's our only chance. It's the only chance. (Static) "There's magic out there." He was looking for real magic. Well, it looks like he bloody found it. And he didn't tell you about any of this? I shouldn't have let him go. (Door creaks) Pop another tape in, would you, AJ? Yeah. Mm-hmm. (Clears throat) (Whispers) We're so close to the source. And we have to keep going. We have to. (Normal voice) And the further we go off the Boiuna, the more-- The more physics breaks down. Reality gets so much... (Laughs) Bigger. I have to see it. We just got a second season. (Birds chirping, animals chittering) Hey, mom. It's dangerous, you know? You shouldn't be out here in the open. All that time, he was on some quest, and he didn't tell me. Come on. You two had your secrets from each other, right? No, Lincoln, we didn't. Oh, enough with the act, mom. The show is over. We weren't a perfect family. I mean, he wasn't perfect. I sure as hell wasn't, and you-- I mean, you had-- What about me? Not even. Lincoln, don't you walk away from me. You come here and you tell me how I wasn't perfect enough for you. You know what? I'm not a kid anymore. All those years, you were his partner, his captain. And all of a sudden, he goes off without you? And you let him? I always was curious. Who was it anyway? - Huh? - It's none of your business, Lincoln. Don't even-- You made my life the whole world's business. You cheated on dad with someone else, so he cheated on you with his work. That is not fair, Lincoln. Stop it. You know, and maybe that's why he went nuts, looking for something to believe in, because he sure as hell couldn't believe in you. You have no idea what our lives were. Sure, I do. I know why you're out here in the middle of a jungle, willing to get yourself killed. No one goes that far for love. But guilt? Sure, that'd get you to the Amazon, and you know what, mom? You should feel guilty, because you were the magic in his life. And when he lost you... (Engine starts) Good. The engine's working. Let's go home. ?Somos mejor que nadie! (Laughs) (Clicking) (Whirring) Come on! Let's go! Mom! (Switches click) (Creaking) (Gasp and pants) Ohh! Ohh! It's working! (Panting) Turn it hard! (Sighs) (Lincoln) We're clear! We're gonna make it! Hey. Hi. One hour till sunrise, two hours till the Yutay. I think we can make it. Yeah. Listen, Tess, I-I keep thinking, if that thing-- If it really is cam Travers, it could know about Emmet. If he's dead... or alive. (Whispering in Spanish) (Loud clank) Pap?. What the hell was that? (Panting) Okay. (Bang, clatter) Oh! Where you going? Getting a shot of it. Lead cameraman. There is a reason. (Click) (Whoosh) Where are you? Huh? Where are you? Come on. Show me your face. (Panting) You know what I think? You haven't got the balls to come out here. (Growling in distance) Here you go. (Panting) (Growling and whooshing) (Screech) Aah! (Grunts) (Grunts) Oh, my God. It's following us. (Whooshing) (Rustling) (Panting) (Screech) Get inside. (Continues panting) (Screeching growl) Damn it. (Panting) Oh, great. Someone grew a pair. Suck it. I'm getting the shot. (Panting and exhaling deeply) (Rustling) (Whoosh) (Sammy) Watch out! It's here! Oh! (Loud screech and growl) (Sammy panting) Fuck, fuck, that was close. (Panting) - Watch out! It's coming back! - Ohh! (Crash) (Growl) (Static) (Crunch) (Screeches) (Whooshing and screeching) Uhh! Fuck oh, my God. Fuck. It's Sammy. Sammy. (Panting) Sammy's dead. (Tess) What? What do you mean, he's dead? What? He's out there, and he's dead. I don't know what happened-- - What the hell are you talking about? - He was just there, and now he's gone. - AJ! - I don't give a fuck! AJ! AJ, what are you-- (Whooshing) (Crash) Ohh! It's going for the engines! (Whooshing) (Crash) (Panting) Come on! Get it going! I... The engine's dead! Come on. Come on! The engine-- Can you fix it? Si prueba demasiada sangre no tenemos a d?nde correr. (Panting) Lincoln, what are you doing? Same thing my father did. I'm gonna trap it. Anything?! Can you see it?! (Low growling) Lincoln, what are you doing?! No, no, no, wait! Wait! Lincoln... (Screech) Come on... (Loud whooshing) (Screeching) Aah! Uhh! (Bleep) - Aah! - Uhh! (Growling) Uhh! (Screech) (Whooshing and growling stops) (Lincoln) Throw it overboard! Uhh! (Water splashes) - Mom! - Lincoln... Mom, are you okay? (Sammy) Watch out! It's coming back! (Crash) You shouldn't have let him up there. He made his choice. (Sighs) Well, Emmet's tapes-- Golden ticket. Mm. Hundred of 'em. What are you up to, Kurt? Mess with my camera. You bastard. Missed one. Gotcha. Emmet Cole saw more than we thought. He may be alive if he is. And if he found The Source, I'll put him down. (Tape rewinds) How you feeling? Fine. AJ, give us a minute, would you? (Click) I thought I knew your father. Me, too. The last dated tape shows him headed west, towards the mountains. But we don't have to do this. We can go home. No, mom, dad's alive you were right to drag us out here. We're gonna look through every single one of those tapes. We're gonna follow every move he made until we find him. You sure? You wanna give up everything to believe it's some ghost? Dad was on to something. And you know what? There is magic out there. So let's go see it. You know there's a camera right there. I know. ? for all the magic there is out there, there's even more magic right here at home with your family. So from all of us at "The Undiscovered Country"... (All) Happy holidays! (Laughs) Bye! (Man speaks indistinctly) (Man) Cut! - Presents. Ready for presents? - All right, here we go. Okay! Merry Christmas! (Laughing) (Giggles) Here you go. Hey. Here, Lena. (Guitar strumming, man singing indistinctly) Just a little something for you. Yeah. Merry Christmas. (Both) ? and down the chimney with old Saint Nick ? ? just put Marbeley down for a second. Okay, he can strum. He-- he can play with him. (Clark) Just like Christmas back home, eh? He wanted to give Lincoln a little bit of normal, Clark. (Birds chirping) (Whirring) (Lever clanks) (Engine starts) (Laughs) ?A toda m?quina! ?Ella vive! (Static) Claro que s? est? viva. (Whirring continues) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, mate. - Oh, bollocks. We need a new camera operator. Yeah? Well, the last one got his head taken off by a ghost. So... good luck with that. (Exhales deeply) (Buzzing) Hey, Jahel. Hab?a un agujero perforado en la cabeza del cilindro que estaba derramando el aceite. You're really not gonna learn English ever, are ya? (Chuckles) Yeah. Emmet's journal says that he and my dad were right there. (Kurt) But when? A month ago? A year ago? Before or after they went missing? We need to know where they were last. We need to establish a time line. (Wings flapping) What about Emmet's tapes? He shot so much footage here. If we could tie him visually to a location-- Yeah, I've been trying, mom, but there's 104 tapes, and there's s no way to put them in any kind of order. About a month before he lost contact with Emmet, he told me that he had a bug bite on his thumb that got infected. He couldn't get rid of it. He asked me to research some sort of medical treatment. Well, how does that help us? We track the bite on the tapes. The worse the infection, the later the date. It could give us some sort of direction. (Dogs barking) One of the strays swam up. He's refusing to leave the boat. (Chuckles) The camera. Yeah. Yeah. Put the next one in. (Motor rumbling) (Rumbling) Okay, wait. Hey, look at the bite there. It's fresh, so that means that tape must be from earlier. Put the next one in. Look. See how bad the infection is? Mm-hmm. So this tape must be more recent. Great, so dad's tapes-- So far we've got eight possible sites, but any one of them could be his last recording. Well, that's more than we had this morning. Pick one, and we'll start there. Could be dangerous. We should warn the crew. Everyone on this boat has been to the Amazon before. Well, they haven't been here to the Boiuna. I mean, hell, according to every map ever made, this place doesn't even exist. Come on. Anyone who doesn't want to stay, we should let 'em go. (Clark) Excuse me. Here's the reality, Lincoln. You let Kurt go, who's gonna protect us? Hmm? Emilio and his daughter-- They keep the ship running. Everyone is on this boat because we need them to find Emmet. You let any one of them go, you're letting your father go, too. (Wings flapping) (Snoring) (Buzzes) (Opens door) (Door creaks) (Water dripping) (Opens door) (Door creaks) Tess? ?Qu? haces aqu?? (Deep distorted voice) You shouldn't have come here. Not Jahel. It's not Jahel. (Whispers) Emmet? It can't be you. (Gasps) (Gasps) Tess, you need to let me go. What? They have me, Tess. I'm not leaving you. Who has you? This place-- I shouldn't have come. Save yourselves. Take Lincoln and go. (Choking) Emmet! Emmet! Emmet! Emmet! (Continues choking) Lincoln! It was him. (Clark) Tess... I know my husband. Sometimes when we want something badly enough, we can imagine it-- I did not imagine this... Emilio, has, uh, Jahel ever done anything like this before? No. So if somehow that was your husband, maybe you'd should listen to him, turn around, go home. If it was someone you loved, could you just leave them alone to die? Yes. And I have. Well, I'm not going to. Emmet gave us a lead. He said, "they have me." Mom, who's "they"? We don't even know who that is. - Who has him? (Lena) - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. In all of Emmet's last tapes, it shows him alone with his crew except for one. In it, he's, um... In the mountains, talking to some kind of local militia. Pull up that tape. Let's find what piece of jungle these guys call home. All I need is a direction. Clark, get your cameras ready. We're gonna rescue Emmet Cole today. Just so we're clear, a little girl who talks to ghosts says... (Whispers) "Don't go," (normal voice) And we're going. Yeah. Emilio? If Emmet-- Uh, if Jahel says anything else, you radio me. ?Entendiste? Actually, a better idea-- Film it. Come on. (Birds chirping) (Clark) AJ, grab the camera. Let's go. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. (Clark) So you really think that was Emmet channeling through Jahel? I know it was. You should put the camera down, watch where you're walking, Clark. You forget I did start life out as a camera operat-- Ow! (Static) Yeah, so carry on, carry on. Emmet's alive, and we're gonna find him. And if we do, what's the first thing you're gonna say to him? I'm gonna tell him I'm sorry. What are you talking about? He's the one that left you to go on this insane quest to find magic. - Shouldn't he be the one to apologize? - Hey. It-- It's all right, Lincoln. Clark is incapable of asking a question without trying to get a rise. Yes, Emmet left me. We've all done things we regret. I know I have. (Clark sighs) Thanks. So you and my dad-- You talked a lot, huh? Just when he needed help. Research, technical support. Or medical help. (Scoffs) Here we go. Is that why you're pissed at me? - I'm-- I'm not pissed at you. I'm-- - Yes, you are. No, I'm not. You're pissed because instead of coming to his son who graduated medical school, he came to me. He had a question, and I was there. There's something to that, you know-- Being there when people need you. (AJ) Be right back. Don't separate. Stay with the group! I've got business. Don't take too well to company. Sorry, mate. He and I need to talk. (Static) (AJ) Hold on. You're not jungle. Guys! (Blade clanks) (Grunts) (Clark) Why would there be a graveyard out here? I thought the locals didn't bury in the ground. They don't. (Grunts) Wow. What is this? (Lincoln sighs) (Clark) "Sir Henry Nevins. Hero to the crown." It seems like sir Nevins and I are both a long way from home. (Tess) "The tree that weeps." British colonial rubber barons came over in the 19th century. Devastated the rain forests, slaughtered the natives-- If they didn't work them to death. Mm. Made a fortune. That's what they called playing hero. Shh, shh, shh. (Child's laugh) (Lincoln) Did you hear something? (Child's laugh) (Tess) It's coming from this way. Go! (Grunts) Wait. (Girl's voice echoing) Mommy. (Growling and chirping) (Whispers) Hey. What's that? - Is that... - Whoa. Is that a child? (Child's laugh) Hello? Hello? (Crying) Honey? Hello? Hola, chiquita. ?Est?s sola? (Crying continues) Hey. Hi. (Screeches) (Gasps) Oh! (Monkey chittering) (Panting) Jesus fucking Christ! How the fuck does a monkey get a doll's head out here?! I think I can see how. (Animals chittering) Oh, fuck. I've heard about places like these. They're called spirit trees. When locals believe that the woods are home to a spirit, they sometimes leave gifts. (Clark) Why dolls? (Tess) This is a graveyard. Mom. What is it? Did you find something? (Sighs) Oh, my God. That's my bear, Marbeley. How? Emmet. He must've been here. He must have put the bear in that tree. We picked the right trail. He must be close. Sun's going down. We have to camp here for the night. Here? With all the dolls? Oh, yes, please. AJ, let's set up some cameras. Let's mine this gold, okay? High angles from the top-- Tree shots. Way ahead of you. Wait. No, no, we can't stay here. If we press on, we could find Emmet by morning. At night out here, the only thing you will find are ways to get killed. We'll pick up his trail in the morning. This is not an option. (Bag thuds) (Click) (Click) (Click) (Clark) How many have you got set up? - One, two... - What else? Show me? Three, four, five, six. (Click) (Whoosh) (Creaking) (Crackles) Mm. (Clark) Tess? Mm-hmm? - You okay? - Yes. Think we're gonna find Emmet tomorrow? Or at all? You know, Clark, you've been on me all day. Would you just give it a rest, all right? - You know, I just want a-- Just-- I just want a quick-- - Yeah, you-- - Give me a quick one. - What do you mean? - Come on, give it to me. Give it to me. Pass it over. - What are you talking about? Don't handle the camera like that. - Hang on. - You focused? - Yeah, hang on. I got it. Just-- just fix your-- - Don't fuss with it. Come on. All right, then. What about you? What are you doing here in the middle of the jungle, looking for Emmet? Hmm. (Chuckles) That's a good question. And do you really care if we find him? Wow. I forget how little you think of me sometimes. Here's the deal. Everybody always thought that Emmet and I hated each other. You know? I mean, it's probably 'cause we spent so much time arguing over every last frame of the show. But... (Inhales deeply) You know. The thing with him is that-- What he never got was that the show, this whole thing, it wasn't about adventure or magic. It's about product. Right? But he was, uh... He was incorruptible, wasn't he? I did love that about him. Here, give it back to me then. Give it back to me. Now... back to the real job. Good night, Clark. Night, Tess. Hey, Lincoln. Hey. Long ago, when I was hiking in Mali, I met a man high up in the Bandiagara cliffs-- A shaman who was old as the hills and said he would never die. And he said to me, "life and death are the same, like a weight on a clock. That swings back and forth. "Tick to tock." Then he said the clock was getting very old and was waiting for someone strong enough to cut the weight and stop the swing. And all the time he's telling me this, that his old wife-- Who was also as old as the hills and would never, ever die-- Was making... This. And she gave it to me and she said that one day, I would meet a child who was strong enough. To do what? Well, that's for the child to know. My place in things was that... I would know the one when I saw him. And when I did, I should give him this. What if I lose it? We never lose the things that matter. I'm-- I'm sorry. It's just-- My dad and I, we barely spoke the year before he went missing. My mom had no idea what he was up to. But you? You knew everything he was doing. Not everything. Marbeley. I remember this guy. You used to carry him everywhere. Yeah. We'd, uh, we'd watched "A Christmas Carol." Jacob Marley was my favorite part. "Marbeley." (Laughs) First ghost you ever saw. Yeah. (Chuckles) (Chuckles) I thought you lost him years ago. I did. When I was, uh, 16, I pitched him into the Indian ocean, swore I'd never set foot on the the "Magus" again. Next day, I left for boarding school. Bit dramatic, in retrospect. (Chuckles) Your dad must've gotten him back. Or the doll tree has friends in Sumatra. Well... When I was a little kid, my whole life was this bear. And my dad... You know, he made me feel like I was the only thing in the whole world that mattered. You know? Like I was the light in his life. You know... One day, that light went off. (Exhales deeply) I don't know why, but nothing I could do could flick it back on again. You know? I mean, I knew he loved me, but... Whatever quest he was on, I wasn't on the map. I know that you think there's some reason that he came to me instead of you or your mom. But... I... I think he was just trying to protect you. He knew what he was doing out here, that he'd be inviting in... Darkness. He wouldn't ever risk exposing you or Tess to that. But me? He could risk me. (AJ exhales deeply) All these dolls. I can't sleep. (Insects and birds chirping) Ah. Actually, you're a good one. You're like Jane Austen's Binkie, aren't ya? All right, well, it's just you and me, Bink. So just open those eyes for me. Do it on camera just once. That'd be fantastic. Yeah? Please? For Uncle AJ? Yeah? Come on. (Crackles) Any spirits out there? I dare you, open that doll's eyes. Go ahead. Bet you can't. (Sighs) God, you're boring me now. (Crackles) Come on. Do it. (Ghostly whoosh) (Yawns) (Grunts and sniffs) (Sighs deeply) I'm going to bed. (Crackles) I'm going to bed. (Lincoln) Aah! Oh! - Uhh! Aah! - Lincoln? Lincoln! - Get off me! Mom! - What did-- What happened? - Who grabbed me?! (Grunting) - Grabbed? Everyone was sleeping. Then how the hell did I end up over here? (Lincoln grunts) Huh? Huh? Oh, this is... (Panting) (Kurt) Where you going? Anywhere but here. We're all leaving now. You won't survive at night in the jungle. Yeah? Stop us. This way. Let's go. - Watch that rock. (Lena) - Yeah. (Clark) It's just a stream. Don't worry about it. Aah! Something grabbed me! - Aah! (Clark) - Give me a rope! Help me! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Tess, hold on! (Screaming) (AJ) Clark, grab the camera! Quick! (Tess continues screaming) (Man) Get her out of there! (All shouting indistinctly) (Clark) AJ! AJ, camera. (Lena) Are you okay? (Tess gasping) (Groans) Okay. Hmm? T?mate esto. No? (Groans) (Groans) Tengo que aguantar... (Moans) (Inhales sharply) Mm. (Exhales deeply) (Deep distorted voice) They won't. I know what's out there. I have to protect them. From what? (Groaning) Something-- Someone was grabbing me. (Clark sighs deeply) Okay. So what you're saying then... (Water splashing) Is that someone is in this stream in-- What, less than... Half a foot of water? Are you sure? (AJ) Easy on the lady, Clark. I saw a hand grab her. Stay out of this please, AJ. I see a dead hand reaching out of the ground, I'm damn well staying in it. I mean, we both pulled her out. What do you think happened? Like I said, thank you. Wait. I remember we used to sit around the campfire, and Emmet... He'd tell stories, legends from wherever we were. And there's this one from the Amazon. La dejada-- The abandoned one. Do you remember? Mnh-mnh. (Insects buzzing) There's a little girl from far away whose mother was too busy for her... (Animals chitter) So she plays by herself in the forest. One day, her doll falls in the river. Her mother isn't there to help her, so... She goes in by herself to try to get it, but she falls in and drowns. They never find her body. They can't even bury her. They say her spirit gets lonely, so... she brings people to the river to drown. So many people have died, locals began leaving her gifts so she'd leave them alone. Maybe this tree is for her. She must've been from one of the old British colonial families. Well... That explains the dolls. But why is it coming after us? (Scoffs) I don't know. You took this from the tree? Come on, man. It's hard enough to believe there's a ghost out here, but one that's mad we took its toys? Please. (Child cries) (Animal chitters) Give it back. Can't believe I'm doing this. (Scoffs) (String whooshes) Lincoln. (Scoffs) Okay, I'm-- I'm sorry I took my bear there. You happy now? (Sighs) I think we're all past a good night's sleep. The sun's coming up soon. Let's pick up your husband's trail. (Whoosh) (String snaps) Put it back. Tie it carefully. - I did. - Do it again. (Machete clanks) (Sighs) Sorry. (Snap, thud) (Gasps) (Machete clanks) Give me the bear. Aah! Aah! (Panting) What do you want from us?! (Girl's automated voice) Mommy. (Kurt) - This way! We can make it to the "Magus." - Go! - This way! - As fast as you can! Fast as you-- Come on! (Clark and Kurt shout indistinctly) (Tess) - Oh, my God! (Lincoln) - Hurry up, mom! (Panting) Go! (Lincoln grunts) (Kurt) - Run! Stay together! - Okay. (Child's laugh) (Tess) Oh, my God. Okay. (Clark) Stay together, guys! Come on! (Child cackling) Aah! (Kurt) We're almost at the "Magus." Go! Go! Come on! Um... the doll tree?! (Clark) You... You led us right back here? We were going the right way. What, so the tree brought us back here?! Huh? Come on! (Giggling continues) It did this. It's trying to trap us. What does it want from us? (Panting) I think it's pretty clear. Where's my mom? She was right behind me. (Cackling continues) - She's not here. - Tess! Tess? (Clark and Lena) Tess! Mom! Where is she? (Tess) - Aah! - Mom?! (Lena) Tess! Where is she?! Who saw her?! Who-- What-- Mom! - Tess! (Kurt) - Tess! (Clark) She was right here. She was right here. Tess! (Cackling) (Clark) Tess! (Tess screaming) (Kurt) It's to our left. (Lincoln) Hold on! - Aah! Aah! - Mom! Help! (Lena) - Tess! Tess! (Lincoln) - Where is she?! Mom! (All shouting indistinctly) (AJ) I can't see anything! (Clark) - She's in here somewhere! (Lena) - Aah! (Kurt) We all saw her drown. (Lena shouts indistinctly) (AJ) Guys, over here! (Clark) Uhh! Keep looking! (Tess, ghostly voice) Lincoln! (Lena) - Tess! - Mom? - Oh, my God. Did you hear that? - Yeah. (Singsongy) Lincoln. Mom! Where the hell is she?! (Clark) Tess! - Mom! - Lincoln. Where are you?! Lincoln! Where the hell is she?! - Wait. - Mom! (Ghostly sounds) Wait. Listen to her voice. It sounds like they're in the same place. - Lincoln! - Where?! Where?! It doesn't matter. If she can take my mom, she can give her back. How do we get her to do that? We give her what she really wants. (AJ) You've gotta be kidding me. If she wants her mother, we'll give her her mother. (Panting) (Clark) Just keep looking, okay? Just look! (Lincoln) What the hell is this? (Groans) (Clark) Here. (Lincoln grunts) That's Nevins. (Grunting) (Clark) There's one here. - That it? - No, no, no, no. This isn't the mother. (Clark) Hey, I've got something. I've got something here. Here we go. Here we go. It's this one. "Taken by the-- Taken by the river." - It's her. - That's her, isn't it? - That's the daughter. - Where's the mother? Wait. (Grunts) She's there. "Her heart broke when love drowned." That's the mother. (Grunting) Wait. (All grunting) (Clark speaks indistinctly) (Lena grunts) (Clark) We gotta get in there, guys. Another two or more to go. More shovel. More shovel! Come on! And the side. We got something. (Grunting) There it is. (Screeches and growls) Please... give her back. You have your mother. I brought her to you. Now give me mine. Come on! Give her back! (Water splashes) Give her back! I mean, how could she just disappear like that? She was right here. (Crying) And now she's dead. I mean, this-- this place is-- is taking them both. It's a fucking nightmare. We shouldn't be here. We should never have come. Now they're both gone. We should never have come. You're not alone. (Grunts) (Panting and gasping) (Tess) Lincoln! Lincoln! (Water splashing) - Mom! Mom! - Lincoln! Mom! Aah! Lincoln! Okay! Oh! (Crying) I couldn't breathe. I thought I was... Oh! (Sobbing) It's okay. You're back. (Lincoln speaks indistinctly) Are you hurt? Let me see. Let me see. Keep the light on her. (Bird calling) Here. You okay? You need to talk to her. About what? We got lucky with her. We might not be with your father. It might be too late. (Door creaks) Jahel? Dad? Dad, if you're still there, I mean, I-I know you can be, but... If you are, I... I just want you to know, I... I understand. There's a whole world of things out there that... I never knew. That's just terrifying. I... But you knew. You know, maybe you were just trying to protect me all that time. But now it's my turn to protect you. We're here for you. If you're still out there, if there's a chance you're still alive, then you-- Dad? Dad, can you hear me? If you're anywhere, you just tell me and I will find you. (Gags) (Coughs) (Gasping) Perd?n... (Whispers) Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay, it's okay. (Switch clicks) (Grunts) ...That one day I would meet a child who was strong enough. So how was your day? (Both laughing) (Both giggling) Hey, Russ, this autofocus is acting up again. It's just-- I guess it's the humidity. (Chuckles) (Giggling continues) Good God. These kids are gonna end up getting married someday. (Children speaking indistinctly) Lena.
