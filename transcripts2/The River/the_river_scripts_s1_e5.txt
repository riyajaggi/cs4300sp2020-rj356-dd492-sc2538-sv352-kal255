 There's magic out there. Beloved television host Emmet Cole has been reported missing. We can find his ship. We can find him. The network will pay, but they want every moment on camera. I am not leaving this close to finding your father. If I had any guess, we'd go through here... This is where Emmet said he was going-- This-- this horseshoe crescent area. That's the Sahte territory.

 He said everything he was searching for would be there-- The Source. This Source-- Did he tell you what it was? Turns out he didn't share all that much while he was watching me get hanged from a tree. All I know is that he was looking for these people-- People who he said could "show him the way." Well, that's the best lead we've had so far. If that's where Emmet was going, that's where we go, and that's where we'll find him. Find them. Of course. Yes. Emmet and Russ and the whole crew. And really, why the accordion?

 My dad taught me. He said no guy ever asks out a girl who plays the accordion. He wanted me to be a boy, and he couldn't have that. He wanted me to be a nerd. Done. People forget about my dad all the time. I know that this search, this... documentary-- I mean, none of it would be happening if it weren't for Emmet Cole, but... my dad's missing, too. You love your father? I mean, what's special about him, to you? A million things. Everything. Can you give me a specific? Other than the accordion. He's... I have a whole lifetime... - You're putting me on the spot. - I, um... I can't think of anything right now. He's my dad. Sorry. Here we go. Mm. - Three 8s. - You're cheating. - Yeah, I am. - You can't do that. I'm teaching you how. Hey, don't scratch. Okay. All right, here we go. I mean, the whole world cried when Emmet Cole went missing, but... My dad-- Sometimes it feels like I'm the only who who misses him. Hmm. Of course we're gonna find him. We know where to look now. We just need to get there. We're barely pulling a knot. We finally know where we're going, and we're never gonna get there. Everyone to the deck. Someone make me some coffee. Well, visibility's terrible, so I need everyone on watch so we can get back up to speed. Uh, some of us do have work to do. Well, if we can't get moving, you can't keep filming, and then you'll be out of work, Clark. Regular intervals, full lookout, shoreline, rocks, sleep rotations every three hours. Everyone pitches in. That means you, too, camera. Marvelous. I should have stayed in the tree. Rock ahead! 20 meters, port side. You know, your dad is pretty much my hero. He's the best cameraman I've ever seen. Taught me to film underwater. Built me this absolutely genius housing. Cheated at poker. You're the first person who didn't tell me how much they loved Emmet Cole before remembering my dad. Every day we look at these tapes of Emmet, and... it's hard, because I know that my dad's there just behind the camera. I can... I can hear him, but I just can't see him. Cafe? Uh, no I've had plenty, thank you. No gracias. I had plenty. Plenty. Muy bien. Bien. _ _ _ _ _ Jonas, keep focused. If we hit something, it's on you. Yes, sir, admiral, sir. What? _ _ Ho! I see something! Hey, guys. Guys, there's something out there. AJ, come get-- get this. What have we got? What have we got? - I don't know. - It looks like a ship. Tess! They're coming straight for us! Hello! - Keep going? - Yeah, yeah. They're still coming. - Oh, no. - Hello! Here, Lena. Hold this. Hello! - They're gonna hit us! - Mom, cut the engine! Can he see us? Hello?! Get down! - What the hell just happened? - Is everyone okay? Mom! Yes! Where the hell did it go? It just disappeared. Sync by Sp8ky and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com That ship-- she ran us aground pretty good. One of our fuel lines is busted. So patch it. We need to be moving by morning. _ _ - What's she saying? - We've got other damage. - What kind of damage? - The kind we can't patch. We need parts. We can't exactly go to the store and pick up a coupler out here, - Now can we, Emilio? - We can't stop now. We have to keep moving. - We have to fix it. - No can fix. _ _ Hang on. So we're stranded in the middle of the bloody Amazon? Mayday, mayday, mayday, all stations. This is the "Magus." Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot. We've run aground. Transmission is damaged. Mayday, mayday, mayday. All stations. This is the "Magus." Position unknown. Mayday, mayday, mayday, all stations. This is the "Magus." We've run aground. Transmission is damaged. Transmission is damaged. Requesting a tow. Need immediate assistance. Tess, why don't you let me take over for a while? That's okay. I got this. Get some sleep. Mayday, mayday, mayday, all stations. Requesting a tow. Need immediate assistance. Over. She looks like a bloody disaster. I don't think we can get anywhere soon. Emmet's tapes. I've seen 'em. Not all of 'em. Here, check the "B" roll. Your dad wasn't always just behind the camera. Hey, Peaches. Greetings from, uh... Where the hell are we, Emmet? Three easy days outside of Manacapuru. Hey, Lena. I heard there's an outpost ahead with a decent dish. I thought I'd upload a message and... Say, uh... Hell, I miss you. Last we talked, you said you were sick of selling skis. I hope you quit that shit by now. Get a job that makes you happy. Remember what I told you? The key is, you just gotta find something you love to do, - and then find someone who'll pay to do it. - Pay... Russ, come here! Hey! We need to get a shot of it. Speaking of which... Love you, Peaches. Talk soon. Mayday, mayday, mayday, all stations. This is the "Magus." Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot. She's been at it for 12 hours. Okay, there's nothing happening around here. We're just burning tape. This doesn't make any sense. This is stupid. I don't care. We're not just gonna sit around here and do nothing. We're paying you so you can take us where we need to go. You're paying me to protect you, right now most likely from yourself. What's the problem, boys? Listen to me. Every minute we waste sitting around here, waiting for a boat that's never gonna come could be the difference between finding my dad dead or alive. We finally have a real lead, so let's follow it, on foot if we have to. We'll ride the zodiacs till they gas out and then hike. The Sahte territory is four days by boat and four weeks on foot. At least we'll be moving forward. Hello, come in, "Magus." This is the "Exodus." We read you. Anyone out there? Hello, "Exodus." Yes, we hear you. Come in. Over. Ha! Everyone stay cautious. We don't know these people. Ahoy, "Magus"! You in a spot of trouble? Ahoy, "Exodus." We were hoping you could help us. We were sideswiped by a boat. Ran us aground. So what brings you? The rainforest or what's left of it. Yeah, we've been going after some illegal logging vessels that have been encroaching in this area. Oh, yeah, how's that working out for you? Well, there's only four of us, so you win some, you lose some. So what can we do for ya? We're in need of some spare parts. Well, lucky day. We're in need of some donations to the cause. Would you take a check? Some of it's pretty old. There's gotta be something in there that you can use. What's with the camera? Uh, we're filming all this for a TV show. Are we gonna be in it? Only if you do something interesting, man. This will do. Gracias. Let us know if you need anything else. Come on. _ Damn boat nearly hit us, and we ran aground. How long's he been missing? About six months. I'm sorry. Uh... Was he out here alone? No, he had a crew with him. Six months. That's a long time in the Amazon. I wish I could help, but, uh, you're the first new folks we've seen in months. Do you wanna stay for dinner? I mean, it's the least we could do. Now you and Lincoln-- What's the story there? Hmm? What's going on? Nothing. No story. Oh, come on. You guys grew up together. You were 16 on a boat. I know how that goes. You can tell me. So, what, is he, like, your first... Family show. Let's say kiss. I've done my interviews for the day. Film the "Exodus." It's a change of scenery. The "Exodus." Whoa, whoa. What was that? What? Looked like someone was on their boat. Whoa. They said there was only four of them. Yeah, and they're all over here. - Here you go. Whoops. - Ahh! Ah ah ah ah! Okay, to the "Magus." May she soon sail again with a full crew. Here we go, here. Cheers, cheers. Ohh! Oh, I forgot how much I love bourbon. So, uh, how did you all meet, then? You ever hear of the Belo Monte dam? That's Peru, right? Yeah, Peru. We-- we met helping out the Achaur people who were being driven out of their homes by the construction. Turns out none of us were ready to go home. Idealists. Oh, God, tree-huggers. Easy, AJ. Uh, listen, I'm sorry. Where's the, uh... End of hallway. Ow! - You all right? - You okay? Yeah. One of the many reasons why I shouldn't drink. You burned yourself. I'll get you a bandage. _ Find them? Of course I wanna find the missing crew, Dr. Cole. But you get paid regardless, don't you? You try to maintain professional detachment. They train you for that. But when you spend enough time with any crew, you start to care. Even if you have other obligations? Ask me that again. What I mean to say is... Isn't it possible you have other reasons for being here? My obligation is solely to the safety of this crew. Yes? Please tell me there's more of that bourbon. - Mm-mm-mm-mm! - Yay! We don't get drunk nearly enough. Why don't we get more drunk more often? We're usually pretty busy. Aah! - All right, drown that out. - That's my boy. Where are we going? Shh, shh, shh, shh. Going on a little trip. In the middle of the night? Well, we saw something on their boat. I say we go over there, look around. Check it out. See if we're right or if we're crazy. We found you in a tree because you filmed something you weren't supposed to. Are you afraid of a bunch of eco-nerds? Come on. If they bust us, we'll say we just got drunk and were looking for someplace to fool around, which will obviously just be our cover. I'm driving. Okay, yes, ma'am. Drink, my brother, drink. So the blonde-- Is she your sister? Oh, no, no. Girlfriend? Huh? Oh, no. No. Why not? Captain, may I have a word? Just... looking for some advice on places to refuel. Okay. Tess? No, thanks, I'm good. - You sure? - Mm-hmm. You don't give yourself many breaks. Well, we're on a rescue mission. I try to stay focused. Mm. Your husband-- He's-- He's lucky to have you. This is crazy. I can't wait for doing this. Sorry, sorry. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Let's make this even scarier. Let's go to night vision. How do I look? Oh, God. Super good. I'm so scared. They're gonna get us. I can feel it! They're gonna come get us! This is so-- - Did you just hear that? - Oh, ha ha. Very funny. No, I'm serious. There's nothing. Look. Watch your hands, watch your hands. Did you hear that? Yeah. Someone is down there. Come on. - Careful, careful. All right, I'm coming. - Come on! I'm coming. They live down here? I don't see any bunks. I don't even see a radio. How'd they hear our mayday call? Did you hear that? There. It's coming from behind the door. Someone's inside. There are only a couple places to fuel for the next 9 kilometers. I'll show you on the map. And I can show you. Aah! Uhh! The Belo Monte dam is in Brazil, not Peru. What, you call me out here to correct my geography? Now... this can be easy, or it can be very difficult. I want you to go back in there, say thank you for the meal, collect your crew, and get the hell off my boat, and I want that right now. Easy, man. We're the ones trying to help you! Uhh! Right now. I don't think so. It is your last chance. Hello? Someone there? Dad? I can't believe it. We found you. You're okay. You're okay! Peaches. Hi. No, no, no! No, no! I don't understand. - No, I came to bring you home. - Lena, forget me. You gotta go. You gotta go now. Kurt? They're collecting people. No! You can't have her! Aah! You cannot have her, too! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Dad, listen to me. - We can get out of here. - We can get away from them. It won't be easy. Those people-- They are not people. So how did you end up here? I was in the jungle, starving. When I saw the... light of the ship, I thought I was dreaming. I thought there was a chance to see you again. They brought me onboard, chained me. When the sun came up, one of them was alive again. He could leave. Wait. What do you mean, "alive again"? The "Exodus"-- It's some kind of a ghost ship. The crew-- They-- They can't leave the river until they find someone to replace them onboard. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So you're saying if we're on this boat when the sun comes up, that we can't ever leave? We... have an hour until sunrise. Aah! There are four of them now. They only need one more. We've been tracking him, and I'm going to any location we can make out on his tapes, and, uh, he left his journal. It's not much help, actually. And I keep telling myself that... It's just him being secretive, but I-I can't help but think that he's lost... That he's lost himself down here. Hmm. You know, the river will do that to some people. You can become something you never thought possible. Hey, did... oh, no. This is all wrong. Who drew this? Well, we're... trying to figure our way the best we can in the Boiuna, but there's no map. Oh, it's on our map, on the "Exodus." You have an accurate map of the Boiuna? Of course. Tess, if you're gonna find your husband, you need to know that you're on the right path. So let me show it to you. Come... to the "Exodus." Well, hello, ladies. We out for a stroll? I'm going aboard the "Exodus." Annabelle has a full map of the Boiuna. Oh, well, that's nice. I'll tell you what. I'll come with you. That's all right. Why don't you give me your camera, Clark? How about you go and... Throw up, get some sleep? 'Cause I need you fresh to sail in the morning. Aye, aye, captain. Good night, Clark. You too, AJ. Ahh! Let the boys know that Tess and I will be on the "Exodus" if anyone needs us. Good night. - Hey, Clark. - Hmm? - Where is everybody? - Uh, I think your mother's looking at a map. What about Lena and Jonas? Oh, well, it's a small boat. If you can't find them, it's probably on purpose. At least someone's getting laid around here. Annabelle? How old is this ship? I'm sorry, Tess. I told you the Boiuna changes people. You can't imagine what it's like being trapped on this river for so long. We've been here long enough. It's your turn now. Kurt, you in there? Clark, wake up. We got trouble. What? AJ, come on! Come on. What do you mean? What's going on? I know this sounds crazy, but I think they've been kidnapped. Kidnapped? What? - What are you talking about? - I don't know. Something's not right. Lena! - What was that? - Whoa. It's the "Exodus"! Oh, no! They're gone. Uhh! Tess! What the hell's happening? Russ? Oh, my God. Tess. It's good to see you. You, too. Is Emmet here? We got separated. I don't know what happened to him. We're turning. They have four of us now. They're just waiting until sunrise. Where are they taking us? The question is not "where." The question is "why." I need 20 minutes more, and she can sail. The could be anywhere by then. We need to go right now. We'll take the zodiac. Keep working. We'll send up a flare. Find us. Okay, let's load up. Let's go. They're taking us east to wait out the sun. Not much time. Clark and Lincoln-- They must have realized something's wrong. You mean the guys on the broken boat who've been drinking all night? He's right. Even if the ship can sail, they won't know where to find us. They will if we tell them. If I can get the transmitter on this camera to work, it'll broadcast the signal back to the edit bay. They can track us from there. You know, it keeps cutting in and out. Russ, if we don't make it out of here, I need to know something. - You wanna know about Emmet? - Yeah. I'm not sure even Emmet knows about Emmet anymore. Something got a hold of him, Tess. I don't know what. There were times I'd wake up. We'd be anchored in the middle of the river, and he would just be... gone. We saw incredible things. He started to think that they were all connected, that all the magic out here came from one source. He became obsessed with finding it, and when we lost the "Magus," he wanted to go on foot. In the Sahte territory. - The Sahte Falls is-- - No, no, no, that's too far. We've been warned against going that deep. I'm not gonna let you do this, Emmet. The Boiuna has tested us before. I think this is the last test right now to see if we're strong enough, so get strong, Russ, or get out of the way. Somehow I knew that would be the last time I ever saw him. Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, I got it, I got it. We're live. All right. You, uh, you should be on the monitors. Yeah. We just need someone to see it. Mayday, "Magus." We're on the "Exodus." They have us. Please, you have until sunrise. You can track our location on this signal. Clark, get the flare so we can signal Emilio. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Flashlight, flashlight. Clark? Hold on! I'm looking for 'em! Flares. Got 'em. - Okay, come on. Let's go. - All right. Go, go, go, go, go. Clark? Lincoln? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Help! Lincoln! Clark! If you... Come on, come on, come on. Where the hell are they? Come on! We don't even know which way they went! It doesn't matter how fast we go. "Magus," we're running out of time. We're stopping. What are they waiting for? Sunrise. "Magus," please, can you hear me? _ Mayday, "Magus." We're on the "Exodus." They have us. Please... We have until sunrise. You can track our location on the signal. Mayday, "Magus." Papa?! Papa?! Uh... - Which way do I go? - Just pick a bloody direction. We picked enough wrong directions. The more time we waste-- We can't just sit here, okay?! Lincoln, Lincoln! Jahel? I'm here. _ Why? _ How much time? Not much. Whoa, whoa, there it is. There it is. Slow down. Slow down. Take it easy, take it easy. Uhh! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Let's get in there. I don't see, where are they? Okay, you ready? Come on. Go, go, go, go, go! Dad. Stand back. We just want our people. What are these people? We just shot them and nothing happened! What are we gonna do?! - They can burn. - Get the flare. Get back! Get back! Get back! Everybody off the boat now! I can't go with you. What? Come on. Let's go. I am one of them. Dad... no. Lena, I'm already dead. You freed me. I can move on. - Wh-- - I've lived my life. I shared it with you. I've got no complaints. - But listen to me. - No! Listen. You go back home now. You live your life. - You find your place away from here. - I'm not leaving you. Listen, some people might think you have a big role to play. You don't have to have a destiny. You can just have a life-- a nice, long, boring life. Go home, Lena. - Lena, come on. We have to go. - No, you can come with us! - We have to go! - Come with me, please! - Lena, come on! Come on! - No! Enough! No, dad! - Lena, come on! - No! Come with me! - Please, dad. - Lena. - No! I won't leave you! - Lena! - I won't leave you! - I love you, Peaches. - Now get on here. - No! - Lena! - I won't leave you. I wont leave you! Daddy, please! AJ, Jonas, get off that boat now! Come on! Dad! Dad! No! No! No! Dad! Daddy! - No! Dad! - Let him go. - Let him go. - Don't! No! Don't! - Let him go. - Don't leave me. No! Dad! Three queens. You're cheating. Good girl. Perfect. I love you, Peaches. Sync by Sp8ky and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com
