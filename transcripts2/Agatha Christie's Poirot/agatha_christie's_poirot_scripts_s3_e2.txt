Initial suspects are Miss Barrowby's niece and her husband, but when the dead woman's Russian companion runs away, Inspector Japp thinks he has the culprit. Poirot thinks otherwise.

Good morning. For me it can be a cooked fish. And a toast without butter. More c'est incroyable. This ship is not a ship. You are right, it is a wonder of our time. - That's right, Poirot.

Can we dispose of you today? - There I will be. - To see if you recover the money? - Do you play ?s letters? - Yes. Only to amuse myself. And a friendly play, only we bet a few pounds. Merci. You read cervelles aux beurre! What is that? Brains of calf fried in butter. I think that I am going to rest more a little. Rays, the Queen is a strong letter. Well, it seems that it lost everything, Ridgeway. So it is... One does not matter that I pay to him then, is not it? Beauty queen Brooks. Miranda. Then, Captain Hastings, does not it manage to sleep? No. He seemed to hear me... Nobody hurled himself to the sea, is not it? No. It was good what had been the orchestra, but not. I felt sorry of this is not able to swim with you. I also.

The titles will be in the ship. I already ordered them a telegram and said to search the passengers, but it would be more simple if I there was. We have to find them! They will be sold, the Bank goes bankrupt! I know. And therefore I want to ask about him a thing. Clear. What he will want. Does it still have the key what I gave him? I never lost sight of it. The biggest British transatlantic liner it ends in Piece of news lorque his first journey. The delay of eleven hours caused for it prevented thick fog from breaking the record. Even so, Piece of news lorque received with enthusiasm the " Queen of the seas ". The journey stayed four days, 12 hours and 24 minutes, to a middle speed of 29 knots. Listen well to the outcry of the crowd. I swear for God, Mr. Poirot. The key was always with me. And where the fact is that it was the night completely, Mr. Ridgeway? Ajogar ?s letters. I know that I must have stayed here, but... ... it is a weakness of mine. - The play? - It is how much that it lost? - Around hundred pounds. The same thing what in the previous night. This is not good for my side, is not it? It can go out, Mr. Ridgeway. We speak then. I am going to present the report to a Commander. Look well at this, Poirot. It is completely cut and marked. Oui, I already examined it. It seems that someone tried to break it down it did not get them to me. Precisement. But then they opened it again. It is curious. They waste immense time trying to break the suitcase down, and then ... sapristi! At last they had the key! Unless they wanted to give the idea of what they were trying to break it down. Oui. C'est possible. In this case it is possible to have been only the Ridgeway. More nobody had the key. - Was it disillusioned? - Well... He was an imbecile, but it was not judging it ably of... I also not, mon ami. - We will find the titles. - Yes. - Or the person who robbed them. - Not more. - You. did Shaw have his key? - Yes. - It is clear. - And does the man have sweats it? - What? - His key. - Clear what I have. - Can I see it? Frankly, McNeil! I came here out. I approached the tacked one. And then I heard a noise of something falling in the water. It seemed to come from there. And it was here that I found Miranda. - The Mademoiselle Brooks. - Yes. She was coming from this side. The box of the Mr. Ridgeway have door for this side, it has not? Yes, have! Me them was not she bringing anything? No. If she had stolen the titles, it could have thrown them edge had been. And the current it was taking them to Piece of news lorque. And following... ... fins were growing they and they were swimming for the coast. So. It is a rude idea. Au counterenrages, my expensive Hastings. It was very observant, as always. Wait there! It was here! You. Vavasour is conscious of the gravity of the situation? Clear what I have! It is a case of police officer. - Of police officer? - Yes, man. His key, the fiance of his secretary... And the idea of transferring the titles also it was his. McNeil! I am his boss! It is better to accompany me. The Scotland Yard is going to speak with. Mr. Poirot, did it already discover anything? - Enough Avanc?mos. - Who had given me to be able to say that. - This man belongs to the customs. My name is Tom Franklin. It is an honor to greet famous Hercule Poirot. Thank you. It began to investigate already, Mr. Franklin? Yes, and I must say that not even a cash hole was passing for my men. - But up to now we did not see anything. - Did the Beauty queen Brooks already disembark? She is an American, blond young person, very pretty. This ship it was bringing more than thousand passengers. - Nevertheless, they arrived too late. - Too late? It will not find the titles in the possession of none of the passengers. - They are not in the ship. - That is impossible. - They could not go out from the ship. - I guarantee you what went out. We have not any more anything doing here. We will already return for London, Hastings. - And you. Ridgeway? - It goes with us. But then and the search, Mr. Poirot? Your McNeil insisted so much... I guarantee him, Mr. Agent, the Monsieur McNeil is not ours. Mr. McNeil, where you are. Vavasour? In the squad, Beauty queen Dalgleish. In the squad? Why? This information is confidential, Beauty queen Dalgleish. He is the Director of the Bank, and I am his secretary. - That does not matter. - I have a right of knowledge! This is ridiculous. Mr remembers. McNeil, you. Poirot arrives from here to a few days. I am not seeing what he could do. I RETURN THE HOUSE It is the return to house. The Queen Mary turns ?s waters territorial of his homeland, and we can see now another element of the fleet, Berengaria, what it follows for the high sea. Two great ships cross so, and now the Queen Mary it addresses for the port of Southampton, and it is prepared to moor. A happy return to house. It is good to be at home, is not it, Poirot? Look, his fiancee is there. - You guard! - Yes, man? Mr. Poirot... I want that they fasten this man for the theft of a million dollars. - What? - Poirot! If he so says it. Come here! How it was able? The ship is so pretty, a Mr. Poirot. It was an unforgettable experience, Beauty queen Lemon. Only that one was pity to have run badly. It ran everything very well. I was never a victim of the evil of mer! - Poirot? - Is it ready, Hastings? We walked already playing there is much time. It is time to count the points. Poirot! This is an absurdity. I do not know what is done from my key. When it is it gave for lack of her, Monsieur? - When the McNeil asked for it me. - Eh bien, and who had access to his office? I. And my secretary. Only one more question, Monsieur. Before breaking the Queen Mary, who was that it put the titles in the suitcase? - I was. Why? - Such as I was thinking, Monsieur. It was that that I was lacking to know. Thank you. Mr. Poirot. And now? I suppose what does not go to say to me what goes on. He knows, Poirot, you are impossible. Why, Hastings? He never says anything to me. Not faco devises where we are it does not even stop where we go. Be patient, mon ami. Soon everything will be clear. The man! It will understand that I am only trying to help it, Mademoiselle. It told to fasten my fiance. You. You told McNeil to fasten. Vavasour. So bad is one like other. Je vous en prie. Be patient. Then? When it came to have with me, it was because it was afraid of Monsieur Ridgeway, yes? It was afraid "for" him. Non, Mademoiselle. He knew that he was a player compulsive. He knew of the debts and it was for this reason because he sold the car, right? I cannot deny it, Mr. Poirot, it seems to the man to know... And also it was afraid what were entrusted him the titles of credit, he them was stealing and disappearing. - I... - It wanted to protect it, Mademoiselle, and it was for this reason because it took away the key to his chief. I do not know the one that refers. Please, Mademoiselle, do not try to be wrong. I know. Did it take away the key? Since it wanted to save the Monsieur Ridgeway, he wanted that we were believing that the key what opened the bad era of his chief. I am afraid of them to myself that that it has not resulted, Mademoiselle. Because the keys had not it swims seeing with that. Because it dragged me up to here, Mr. Poirot? I thought that it would be educative for the Monsieur McNeil. Is it even a truth? You. Vavasour and you. is Ridgeway imprisoned? Well, one of them stole the titles. No, no. They did not steal anything. In fact, there was nothing to steal, the titles were stolen very much before it starts of the Queen Mary. But that is impossible. We were always with the suitcase. Non. Shovels du tout, mon ami. The Monsieur Vavasour it put the titles in the suitcase, me them he has the weak sight. It was own him who said to us. A million dollars in titles of credit. He would not have repaired what the titles what had in the hand they all were false ones. False? He is saying that the titles were what were in the Queen Mary false? Exactamente, mon ami. But why? Who would benefit with that? You. Shaw will rest now. Yes, clear. Nurse Long, pardon, does it have hours what one says? They are four and in Dec. C'est here. Pardon, Mademoiselle... Does it have hours what one says? They are nine and it halves. In the ship, I asked him the same question. The disguise was almost perfect. But the movement the same thing was exactamente. The movement of the experienced nurse what uses the clock to the chest. Miranda! Mademoiselle Brooks. Or Mademoiselle Long... ... what travelled with the copy of one of the keys, what stole the false titles and what was released of them. I do not know about what he is talking. He is saying nonsenses. It cannot be she. Miranda Brooks it was absolutely dazzling. The Monsieur Philip Ridgeway it would keep the fault. Monsieur Ridgeway, with his problems of play. He would be the obvious suspect. It would be it... ... as they say, scapegoat. Me them he robbed them. It is him that had them! It is precisely what they wanted what was thinking, Monsieur McNeil. It is therefore that it was essential what the Ridgeway digs in the ship. No, he was Mademoiselle Brooks what it tried to run over the Monsieur Shaw. It went to Mademoiselle Brooks what treated the poisoning. Did Miranda plan everything that? It is well. Yes. It was right. Holy God! What it is going to do? To call the Police officer? Very well, hurry with that. So many conversation! A thing of every time. The Mademoiselle Brooks is doing the honorable attempt of protecting his accomplice. The Ridgeway! No. Since it would have been simple for you. Shaw to steal the titles what had been entrusted him, if it had taken them to side of the ship! Too simple. And too obvious. The bank would have known precisely where to look. It is insinuating what I am wrapped in this, in some form? I was arranged in layers. Yes, clear what was, Monsieur Shaw, due to the poison... ... what was false, as well as the attempt of running over. It was completely an essential part of his plan for what Monsieur Ridgeway it was taking his place in the ship. - But you. Shaw still had the key. - No, Monsieur McNeil, he had a copy of the key. The Mademoiselle Brooks it had the true one. Skies! I lament, Miranda. Are they married? No. But we were going to marry. Lament. Do not lament. The prison cannot be much worse of what 25 years in the London and Scottish Bank. Come, Ridgeway. It is free. Where the McNeil is? I keep on not realizing because it told me to fasten. Because, Monsieur Ridgeway, I saw the loan sharks ? his wait in Southampton and I thought that it would be more safe in a cell of prison. Well, I suppose what is true. And also it did with what the true ones blamed if they were distracting a little. I have an immense debt for with you, Mr. Poirot. I was promoted Vice-deputy Geral. I paid all my debts. And never again you are going to have none. Obliged by everything. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Au revoir. Do we deserve to commemorate, not, Hastings? A glass of cr?me of menthe? It despises the liqueur, Hastings. Alors... For you, my friend, perhaps a whiskey? No, thank you. Hastings, it is not livened up with our success? Yes, yes. Very good. - Does Ne encore read shovels badly of mer? - No, I am well. Hastings, we finished now a case very well succeeded. Two men were freed of a very unfair encarceramento. It had the privilege to watch Poirot in his most brilliant form and, for besides everything this, it did a beautiful travel in the Queen Mary. I know, Poirot. Excuse. She is Miranda Brooks. Hastings... ... it still has a fraquinho for that fascinating young person? No, no. Of all. On the contrary. Only what... There she was ... as you said... ... a fascinating young person what, with a wig and a little of make-up, it was managing to change in that inelegant nurse. Yes, it was a very good disguise, Hastings. But... ... if a woman manages to do that, it can do the opposite. And so, where we are we? In the beginning of the wisdom, mon ami. But this also is a motive to commemorate, n'est you shovels? Legendagem: Thor
