 ♪ Upbeat music ♪ ♪♪♪ ♪ It's Showtime tonight ♪ [Man] Previously, on "Black Monday"... I told you. I got you. It's gonna be pretty hard for me to push through your precious bank bailout if I'm not a congressman. [Connie] Hey, Mo! Dawn, there is so much I wanna learn about you. Double date!

 This has nothing to do with Dawn. [Connie] Why is she meeting with the AASF? Are those Skants? Skirt on the outside, pants on the underside. I have pallets and pallets. They're all that's left of my family business. You know business isn't just for the guys anymore. ♪ All hail the power of Jesus' name ♪ ♪ Let angels, prostrate, fall ♪ [ecclesiastical organ music playing] My family has always been close. I credit our long walks to church every Sunday since I was a girl. But walking that far in a skirt

 had my thighs chafing like two blocks of parmesan. [audience laughs] Am I right? And so one day, during a rebellious phase, - I wore pants. - [audience gasps] I know. I know. [whispers] But it felt great. Of course, not in my soul. In my soul, I felt great shame. But out of that shame came what I call an e-Tiffany. Combining conservative comfort with sinless style. They're practical and patriarchal. Fundamentalist, yet fun for your fundament. - Ooh! - [women giggle] They're Skants by Pfaffashions. Half pants, half skirt, double discretion. Finally, you can be an independent modern woman and no one will ever have to know! [Cheers and applause] But don't just take my word for it. There she is! ♪ Choir music ♪ ♪♪♪ Now, when my father, Pastor Newell Swafford, our shepherd in the sky... [Tiff] Praise be. ...got a look at me in these Skants, he quoth the Lord: "She is clothed in strength and dignity," Proverbs 31:25. [Audience] Amen! And now you can be too. - Ye phone lines are open! - Yes, yes, yes, yes! Call and order. We're ready for ya. Get 'em stonewashed in holy water. Or acid-washed in what Hollyweird calls acid rain, but is really just the good Lord's tears. And I'll tell ya, Corkie, they cut quite a silhouette. Forgive me, Father, for I have thinned! [audience laughs] Now do we have any moms out there? [cheers and applause] Good. Yay! So from praying to oven scrubbing to submitting to your husband, we've got your kneeling needs covered. [audience gasps, cheers] [cheers and applause] 'Cause Skants are made by moms for moms. Can I get a mom-men? [audience] Mom-men! - [Corkie laughs] - I can't hear you! Can I get a mom-men? [audience] Mom-men! Hey Tiff, we got a question. Hi, Mrs. Pfaff! I love these Skants. Speak your truth. But were you able to wear them when you were with child? Yes, abs... absolutely, I was. And you know what? Mazel tov to you with this! I mean, not mazel tov. Halla-lu-yur. How many children do you have? Well, you know what? We can never have enough, am I right? And if you act now, we'll even throw in a belt... Bible or chastity. Does that mean you only have four or five? What? So she said, "Does that mean you only have four or five children?" Um, you know what? I believe we're all God's children. "Teach them well and how to fish, and they will learn how to kill fish forever," Adverbs 36:24:36. - I don't recognize that verse. - It's a new one. I mean, you just said that Skants were made for moms by moms... Yes, they... they are made by moms in Bangladesh or Honduras or wherever. You know, I don't fucking know. [audience gasps] I wish you hadn't used that language. [muffled] I don't have any kids, Corkie. I'm still on birth control. - [audience gasps] - Okay. [Muffled] Corkie, no. Corkie, no! - Please! - [Tiff] Corkie, please. - Gimme another chance, Corkie. - I'm so sorry. ♪ All hail the power of Jesus ♪ Nope, nope, nope. We've gotta get this down now. [Tiff] ♪ The power of Jesus ♪ Let me sing it! Corkie! ♪ Funky music ♪ "BLACK MONEY" Season 02 Episode 08 Oh, finally got you on that date. - [Dawn laughs] Yup. - Reminds me of old times. Still don't know why you came back, Momo, but I am glad you did. I still have a lot of love for you. Oh. I love... Which is why it's so important for me that... you like Marcus. You're my best friend, Momo. And-and he's a really good guy. Yeah, well, I'm not gonna like Marcus. And I don't want you to like Dede, like, at all. Wait, but she's our client. Yeah, so is Marcus. But what does that have to even... oh! - Hey - Hello. Sorry I'm late. Had to vote. Every vote counts. [laughs loudly] So true! - Why is that funny? - Oh, the electoral college. Gerrymandering. Gerrymandering. How white people be fucking over black people.. - [Dawn] Everything. - When they try to vote. - Got it. - [Mo] Yeah. But I do like Bush, so tic that box on the reg. - Check! - [laughter] I am so glad we can make this happen. - Well, you were so insistent. - Yes. So we can get to know each other better, right, Dawn? - Yes, yes. - So tell me everything, girl. Okay, why don't we, uh, order, you know? Let me get the waiter over here. Well, no, no. That-that's the beauty of this place. Omakase. No decisions. You just roll with it. These next three hours are gonna blow your mind. - Three hours? - [Dawn] Wow. - That sounds like a threat. - [laughter] So Dawn, Mo told me that you two were together on Black Monday. - Yes - [Connie] What was that like? Uh, you wanna know the real? - I wanna know. - [Mo] Well, I... - Okay... - I don't vote. I can't. I'm a felon. [Marcus] Oh, wow. Sorry to hear that. A lot of brothers in that same boat. - What happened? - Oh, my God. - That's such a long story. - [Dawn] Mm-hmm. So Dawn, back to Black Monday... The year was 1968. Hair was long... under women's arms, and a Broadway hit. - [chuckles] - ♪ inspiring music ♪ I was just a young idealist who was tired of Uncle Sam and Uncle Toms. - [Dawn] Yes. - [laughs] Yeah. So I joined the Black Panthers. - Really? - Really? Really? [chuckles] Really. - [exhales] - [Blair] Wow! This place turned out... - [Both] Perfect! - [Tiff squeals] I can't believe this used to be your parent's stuffy shithole! I know! And it's gonna be photographed tomorrow for a big spread in Penthouses Magazine. We're gonna be the Penthouses Pad of the Month! - Rad! - Right? Oh, this place is great! Oh, I'm so glad you like it. I mean, it could do with just one tiny addition. What? We just finished renovating. What could we possibly need? A nursery? Unless you mean for plants, the answer is, "Fuck no. Are you crazy?" And that kind of works for plants. Blair, I want a baby. The next words out of your mouth better be "grand piano," "bird," or 'I Love Your Way' cassingle." I'll do all the work of hiring all the people to do all the work. You will not need to do a thing except... And I've even taken the liberty of setting up bathroom four with some lotion and the new Richard Gere GQ. - Mmm! - Hmm. No, Tiff, we're not raising a baby together. I know firsthand how a bad parent can fuck up a good kid. - No, no, no, no. - Blair! Ah! You don't get to say no to me! Okay, you have hijacked my name and my life and my identity. I was Tiff Georgina, and now I'm just some mom-abee hawking Skants to a bunch of Bible breeding bitches on a channel in the teens! It's not great, Blair, but I'll take it. And you don't get to take it from me. And unlike you, I don't get to have a beard. Unless I go off my spironolactone. - Is this really what you want? - Yes. Yes, yes! But my clock's a-tickin', so you've got to get your Richard in gear, so to speak. A little dollop'll do ya? Little squirtages? Okay, okay. What if we do a test run first? Yes. I know this hotshot who's coming to the election party tonight, and he's got three kids. So why don't you stay home and offer to babysit and see how it goes. Afterwards, if this is still what you want, I'm on board. Yes! Oh, it's a deal! It's a deal! It's a deal, Daddy. [baby-talking] And here's our little baby boo-boo. Okay, well, don't infantilize the cup... - [smooching] - ...'cause I have to... - Uh-oh. Baby's hungry. - ...use it. [Indistinct chatter] I think I see my campaign fund manager, if you'll excuse me. I've been calling you! Oh, yeah? You miss me? Not as much as you missed our media buy targets. It's too close to call with 85% of districts reporting. We lost Chateauguay, Blair, where I supposedly live. Okay, well, the only château gay I know is a boy-lesque house in the West Village, where we're gonna celebrate later tonight when you win. It's upstate, but you'd know that if you spent a little more time and money on my campaign. Well, look at that. We just lost Schenectady. This is on you, Blair. - I swear to God, if I lose... - We can't lose. We're wearing our lucky shoes. Are you kidding me? Don't try to ruin my life any more than you already have. There are cameras everywhere. My kids are here. Of course my wife is not because I think she's onto us, but at least the big guy in the sky could make it. - God? - [Harris] No. My fucking evil father-in-law. Speak of the devil. Dad! Glad you could make it. Looks like you won't. What, couldn't get the Chateaugays to come out? You never should've forsaken me, my child. That was an exit line, boys! Let's go! Move it! ♪ Dramatic music ♪ Okay. Roger, don't let him get into your head. Don't touch me. ♪ Dark music ♪ ♪♪♪ Welcome to my home. Won't you please come in, you little darlings. Hello. Uh, señora, feel free to help yourself to any food in the Help fridge, and, um, please don't let the children touch anything. Big photo shoot tomorrow. And if you need me, I'll just be mommin' around in my bubble bath. [In thick accent] Señora, I can't stay. I have to vote. With that accent? Oh, they're not gonna let... [Without accent] [Lal had you there for a minute, didn't I, puta madre? Okay, you're a cutup. Seriously, though, I gotta go take care of my own kids. Fine. I guess I'll just puta them on the couch, and I'll madre. ♪ Funky music ♪ Kids, what are we drinking? ♪♪♪ [Mo] People remember the guns, but they don't remember the fun. I joined the Panthers to serve kids breakfast, you know, do the whole book drive thing. And then I met her, and what happened next not only changed my life, but it changed the course of history forever. Well, that seems like a natural stopping point. Are you crazy? Go on, Mo. Yeah, please. Come on, Momo. ♪♪♪ [no audible dialogue] [Mo] Even though I didn't know that bitch was FBI when she said, "I got you." [Dawn] Mmm! There was something about it that was just... It was eating at me. Mm, kind of like how I was just eating the hell out of that miso black cod. That kind of reminds me of Black Monday. - Dawn... - Uh, one second. - Ugh, that evil bitch. - Oh, the worst. ♪♪♪ [no audible dialogue] ♪♪♪ Sorry, y'all. I kind of feel like I've been talking this whole time. I agree. Come on, now. You gotta finish. Yeah, please, please. More. [Mo] Okay. ♪♪♪ You know, so there I am, 24-year old kid. I'm standing in front of this federal judge, right? - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - And he's looking at me, just licking his chops, and that motherfucker gave me eight years while that bitch just laughed. - Wow. That's a fuckin' story. - [Mo] Yeah. What happened to that bitch agent? Okay, I think we're throwing the B-word around a little liberally. [Mo] Well, sometimes that word applies. Yeah, the bitch sounds like a bitch to me. [laughs] Yeah. Well, I never saw the bitch again, but, I don't know, it just feels like she's always with me somehow, you know? - Mm-hmm. - [Marcus] Bitches do that. Mm-hmm. Wow, Momo. Yeah, bet you're thinking about my tragic tale of woe, huh? Mm-mm, I was actually thinking, "How old is this nigga?" That's fair. - So anyway, Dawn... - I was a Panther too. Get the fuck out of here. - No. - Oakland. Those co-intel pro-FBI undercover motherfuckers... - [Dawn] Mm! - Erased a whole future of strong black men leading. [Dawn] Mm-hmm. That's why I got into the AASF: to give it back. - [Dawn] Mm-hmm. - Power to the people. - Come on, now. - Power to the people, brother. You know, black women created the Panthers to address the concerns of the community before the men took it over and turned a nonviolent school food program into an army. Mm. Just another institution hijacked by male ego. And I know you can relate to that, Dawn, 'cause, I mean, - you spent some time... - Oh, ooh, ooh! - I got another story. - [Connie] No, no, no, no. You've had your fill, buster. Wait, wait, wait. You're with the FBI? [both] What? Nobody else hears it? 'Cause to me, it sounds like you with the bitch from the FBI. - [Mo and Marcus murmur] - You know? [laughs] You're okay w-with-with her trying to set up Mo and all those other strong, intelligent black... - Kings. - Kings. Kings! You are kind of coming off like that. - [Marcus] Shit. - Mm-hmm. All I'm saying is if we want civil rights, we have to be civil. So I'm sure that agent had her reasons. [laughter] What the fuck are you talking about? [Dawn] Bitch, you sound crazy! This bitch sounds out of her mind! [Connie laughs sarcastically] All right. All right. [Dawn] Oh, my God! Where the sake, baby? ...caucus headquarters a bit less joyous tonight. And now I'm hearing that they're tallying the final vote in the contentious neck-and-neck race for Roger Harris's seat in congress, and... yup. Yes, it sounds like they're prepared to call. They're calling it right now. The winner is Congressman Roger Harris. [cheers and applause] ♪ Upbeat music ♪ [all] Speech! Speech! Go give the people what they want. ♪♪♪ I want to thank the great people of New York! [Cheering] Listen, uh, Blair. I learned a lot of information at that Halloween party and tonight they could fuck up everything for everyone, but... Oh, big surprise. Keith's a rat again. I was going to say, "But I don't know if I should use it." You know, maybe I could tell you what I know, - and you could... - What, confirm it for you? How convenient. Whoa, Jesus! Whoa, whoa! You got the wrong idea. Please, I was looking for a wire. Like the one you wore to my wedding. What do you want? I'm having a weird night, man. I wanna help you, okay? 'Cause I was you. And this doesn't end well. Let's be friends. Can you imagine how powerful two guys like us could be together? I'm not your friend. I'm not like you, and I don't like you. ♪ Tense music ♪ Your funeral. And I'd like to thank, most of all, my wife at home. I love you, Mother. And then the princess embarked on her greatest adventure: going a size down. Can I play with your makeup? Oh, sweetie, I think you're a little young. Daddy says it makes me look hot. You mean cute? No. [slowly] Okay. You know what? Um, why don't we just play house? Okay, how about you be the dad, you be the mom... And you be the mistress! - Hey! - [children laugh] [boy] You liked it. [Harris] So glad we stayed all the way to the bitter end, huh? Oh, yes. Absolutely. [photographer] Say cheese! - [all] Cheese! - [Harris laughs] [Harris] Thank you, again, so much. All right, good night. Congratulations, Congressman. I'm sorry I got a little bitchy. I was just nervous. I couldn't have done this without you. No one got behind me the way you did. Maybe it's time I got behind you. [chuckles] Well, cute double entendres aside, how quickly do you think you can get behind this bank bailout? Immediately. After I solidify my standing and another term seems in the bag, I will slip it right in. Wait, another term? We can't wait that long. Are you being serious right now? Blair, pushing through a bailout and benefitting my campaign finance chair right after the election? Well, that's just not gonna happen. Big B, the whole reason that I wanted to get away from Newell was so that I could start doing things that I believe in: helping the hardworking people of America. Fuck them. Excuse me? You heard me. Fuck them. You owe me. We had a deal. Okay. This is a good night. Let's not ruin it. The limos are waiting. Maybe we should ride separately... for the optics. ♪ Dark music ♪ I have a tape. Remember Halloween? I had the security cameras recording in 12.7 millimeter VHS resolution. How 'bout those optics? What did you do? Nothing. Yet. I am so sick of this relationship being on your terms. You call when you want. You disappear. You snap at me. You use me. Sponsor the bailout and no one has to see you go down. You're on the tape too. It's mutually assured destruction. Try me. First you try to bribe me. Then you try to buy me. Now you try to blackmail me? I don't know who you are. [scoffs] I don't know if I ever knew you. Who are you, Blair? ♪ Sorrowful music ♪ ♪♪♪ Excuse me. Uh... uh, boys? Pastor Swafford, I have something I think you're gonna wanna see. [Keith] Larry! You're never gonna believe what I got on Blair and that congressman. Oof. [distant groan] - Hello? - [glass clinks] Larry? Larry? ♪ Dark music ♪ [man groans] Oh, my God. Larry, are-are you okay? Oh. Hey, Keith. It's me... [grunts] ...Lenny! No, no, no. Lenny is dead. Dead? [laughs] Oh, far from it, Keith. You see, when that old man fell on top of that car, uh, my spine was shattered to dust. [pants] I had so many transfusions that the nurses would joke that my blood type... [inhales] ...was "O-shit." I was the lucky recipient of the first ever ribcage transplanted from an animal, which never would've been possible without the help of Dr. Bananas! Mm, the brave silverback gorilla who gave her life so I can breathe... very-very painfully, hmm. Wow. Um... that... that sucks. - I'm sorry about that. - Yeah. Um, is-is Larry around? Are you fucking serious? I have gone through 37 surgeries. I am part RoboCop, part... [inhales] ...Donkey Kong. And you have no follow-ups? Uh, okay. Uh... how are you? What have you been up to? Well, you know. Hiding in the shadows, plotting, scheming, doing PT. Lots of... lots of PT until I am ready to reclaim my seat as the rightful head of the Leighman Brothers! [laughs shortly] [coughing violently] Uh, okay. All right. So just tell Larry that I-I dropped by, and I'm gonna get out of here. Wait! Wait right there! [pants] What were you just talking about... in there, about Blair and the congressman? Because there is something very off about those two. Keith, do you know what I'm talking about? No. Yeah, I-I, uh... - I don't. - [scoffs] I don't think I believe you. Keith, I still think you're protecting people who don't give a soft shit about you. So pick a side, Keith. Ours or prison. Wait, what? No, no. That was never part of the deal. Larry and I are friends. He needs me. We're bringing the Leighman Brothers into the '90s. He lied to you! You are not needed, Keith, because you are nobody. You are nothing. - Fuck you. - [Lenny] Fuck you! I want my revenge! Or you go back to jail, Keith! I want my revenge! ♪ Tense music ♪ Oh! All r... I-I've seen enough. Avert mine eyes, boys! Disgusting. [Blair] Could be quite a scandal for you if this tape got out. Wonder what your flock would think? Or your daughter? I imagine enrollment in your conversion therapy program, the Newell School for Gayward Children, might drop, but it doesn't have to. You're a man of influence. Call the governor and all your other powerful friends, or I'm gonna call every newspaper I know. [Newell] You'd really do that to Roger? My mother used to say, "In life, when something breaks, you can't always put it back together, but you can use the pieces to move forward." Your son-in-law broke his bank bailout deal with me. I'm just using the pieces. Your bank bailout for the video? Exactly. Nothing personal. Just quid pro quo. Done. Give the tape to Gregory, the dirty blond. We're bankrupt? Again? Shut your pierogi hole! You're just my sex Slav. [laughs] Do Christmas! [in thick Slavic accent] McDonald's on Christmas? It's tradition! - [ashtray shatters] - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. Okay, time-out. Time out. - Now, let's not throw things. - ♪ rock music ♪ Oh, no, no, no, no. You wouldn't dare. - [laughs] - Put that down. - Put that down. - ♪ Kick it! ♪ Oh! Oh, you are in so much trouble! No. This is unacceptable! ♪ Man, you don't wanna go ♪ [Tiff] Don't you dare throw that! - [boy shrieks gleefully] - [Tiff] Oh, my God! - No! - ♪ You ask your mom please ♪ - ♪ But she still says no ♪ - No one can see that! ♪♪♪ Oh, my God! ♪ You gotta fight ♪ ♪♪♪ - ♪ For your right ♪ - You know what you need? ♪ To party ♪ Ooh, you nasty woman.

[kids cackle] ♪♪♪ [demonically] Come to Mama. ♪ Party ♪ ♪♪♪ [doorbell rings] Junior, Eric, Ivanka, time to go. Where are your manners? [Huffs] - Where did she come from? - She's a comedian. - That shit's just funny. - [laughter] It don't make no sense to me! He was plotting against the governor. Entrapment! The government plotted against him! - They made him do it. - Hey, Mo? What is he doing here? Hey, Mo, can you come talk to me? Keith, we're in the middle of fucking dinner right now, okay? Yeah, but I'm also in the middle of fucking something right now too, so... I really need a friend. I'm not your fucking friend, Keith. Come on. You wanna talk to somebody? Go dial a 1-900 number or something. We're doing some black shit right now. Do you mind? Fuck off. All right. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. - Oh, God. Guys, guys. - [Keith] Fuck you. [Mo] Keith, you're interrupting. - Fuck you! - [Mo] Fuck you, Keith! You're drunk. What are you doing here? At least I don't work for the FBI. Oh, yeah. You did-didn't know that? - [Marcus] Excuse me? - Yeah, yeah, no. - This is a little rat. - Okay, look. - Let-let's talk outside. - No. Talking's over now. Let me tell you a little story about this guy, Mo Monroe, or whatever the fuck his name is. He was the guy behind that whole Amerisavings shootout shit just, you know, to fuck you over. He wanted to take down TBD, you know? And then the FBI... Yeah, oh, she's undercover right now. Great job. I love the outfit. She busted him and turned him. [Laughs] This is fucking bullshit. Why would you... why would you say all that, Keith? Oh, uh, I wonder why? 'Cause you fucking put me in jail. - [Marcus] What's happening? - [Dawn] I don't know. I-I-I mean, I wouldn't trust what he says. Oh, you don't trust me? Why should he trust you? You're the one trying to fuck over the AASF fund. You are? [Mo] Oh, shit. But look, I'm no better. I'm working with Larry Leighman. Guess you didn't know that. I'm the one who leaked the yen trade. But I'm done. I'm fucking out! I don't wanna do this anymore. For the last week, I've been trying to figure out, "Whose side am I on?" And I just realized right now, tonight, I'm on my side. I wanna be happy, okay? I wanna be free of all of this. So in the immortal words of you, "Fuck 'em all." [clapping slowly] Wow. You know, he's right. Fuck all of y'all. And to answer your question, Dawn, I am with the FBI, bitch. And I'm ruthless, just like you're gonna be when your mom, Ruth, is too ashamed to visit you in jail so you see a lot less of her. That's a long way to go just to get a dig in. It was a stretch, but the point is, you're all going down. No, no, no, you said you were gonna leave Dawn out of it. Look, ain't nobody being left out of shit anymore, Mo, okay? Including you and Larry Leighman, Keith. Thanks for that, uh, heads-up on your insider trade. I'm coming for all of y'all. So good luck sleeping, 'cause the next knock you hear could be me. [Knocks on table] Power to the people, motherfuckers! Marcus. Marcus. Great job, Keith. Well, all I wanted to do was talk. You motherfucker. Babe, I had the worst night. E... Oh, my God. What the fuck? What happened? I... will never... have... kids. Oh, no. Babe. Dang it. I was really starting to come around to the whole thing. In better news, I got the bailout. It's a lot tougher than I thought it was gonna be. Blair, what the fuck? ...out of the 13th District, sex scandal rocks the political world today when a VHS tape was released... [Blair] What the? Newell released the tape? ...showing the newly elected congressman from the 13th district in scandalous behavior. Of course, neither he nor his campaign headquarters have commented. [Line trilling] Please pick up. Please pick up. Please pick up. Please pick... [Harris] Please leave a message. - Fuck! - [Harris] ...after the tone. Roger? This wasn't me. I-I-I-I did not do this, and I am so fucking sorry. Please pick up. Please! Fuck! ...involved in scandalous behavior with his finance campaign chair. ♪ Discordant music ♪ ♪♪♪ Roger?
