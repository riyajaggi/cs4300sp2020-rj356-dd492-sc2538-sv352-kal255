 ♪ Upbeat music ♪ ♪ It's Showtime tonight ♪ Previously on Black Monday... What if there was a club just for men? Have you never heard of Just F-O-R Men? Hey, girlfriend! I am back at the Jammer Group. That's my Keithy! Haven't you felt a little guilty since the crash? - No. - There's no Georgina. All that's left is a bunch of pallets of Skants

 that we couldn't even give away. - It's a skort. - It's Skants. Call me Dede. I understand you're looking for an investor. We have evidence that points to Blair and Dawn. Blair is using Congressman Harris's insider information to front-run the market. You want to finance my campaign? Marcus is head of the African American Scholarship Fund. I just don't think we are the right firm for you. Who else should I trust with $30 million dollars' worth of our community's futures? Our deal is Blair, not Dawn.

 If I find out that you're lying for her, you're all going down. Mo, you call this spooky? I specifically asked for mid-shin, and this fog is ankle deep at best. Tonight is TBD's coming out. We have to prove that we can party with the big boys, and this shit, this looks like Tito tried to remake the "Thriller" video. Dawnie, no one's gonna be paying attention to any of these decorations when they get a load of my bitches' brew. 'Cause they're gonna be miles high. Oh, wow, nothing says "partying" like obscure jazz references. Obscure? Miles Davis is literally all people think of when they hear the word "jazz." Just take a taste. Something's missing. - Ta-da. - Mm, Robitussin. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Oh, you remember that New Year's Eve we got so 'tussin'd, I tried to buy weed off an undercover police horse? You had a Robo seizure during sex. Oh, my God, I thought I was gonna die. - Me too. So let me ask you something. You, uh, trying to impress all the clientele... or just Marcus? Shut up, Mo. Hey, don't worry about it, Dawnie, okay? You're the second-best boss this place has ever seen. Happy Halloween! ♪ Punchy music ♪ Well, I did it. I got my next big idea. I told you, Dawn. Sometimes you just have to have... faith. - Is that my leather jacket? - I don't get the reference. Reagan is going to announce major tariffs against Japan tomorrow at 7 a.m. This is TBD's chance to get back in the black and "yen" some. All we have to do is short the yen, and we'll make a fucking killing. Yeah, but how can you be so sure that he's even gonna do that shit? Um, I have been analyzing, uh, foreign currency markets and, uh, cross-referencing geopolitical... You stole the info from that congressman you're blasting. Yes, Dawn, I did. Yes, Dawn, he did. Look, I love him, but this is bigger than love. This is money... so much money... And he's never gonna know. This is a fucking brilliant idea. You really are a whiz kid. Do this shit immediately. - Thanks, Mo. - Yeah. But Dawn, in order to make a big enough profit to really un-Ponzi our asses and balance our books once and for all, we're gonna have to tap in to your AASF funds to leverage all the way up. Okay, on second thought, using the African American Scholarship Fund's cash to insider trade on top-secret stolen information... I mean, yikes. We should sleep on this. Better yet, let's black out on it. No, because the second word gets out, people are gonna jump all over this and kill the profits. - Also, fuck off, Mo. - Wait a minute. No, no, no, no, no, Blair, listen. He's right, though. All right? This is... this is dirty, even for us. Yeah. I've managed to make a good, honest profit keeping the AASF money separate, you know? And I'm not about to risk all those kids' future. Not to mention if the SEC finds out, we are fucked... - Ooh. - Forever. Forever fucked. But that's the best part. No one's ever gonna find out. The SEC doesn't track Asian markets after 2 a.m., and the only evidence is gonna be a disc in our own record room. All we have to do is trash that disc after we make the trade, use the windfall to finance Harris' campaign, then he'll jam through a fat AmeriSavings bailout for us, and we can go back to being the honest, equal-opportunity firm of the future that we promised we would be after we destroyed Mo. No offense, Mo. Some taken. But in order to do this, we have to use those AASF funds, Dawn. - Trust me. Oh, God. ♪ I believe the children are our future ♪ ♪ Teach them well ♪ ♪ And let them lead the way ♪ Dawn, you hate kids. I do. ♪ Punchy music playing ♪ Whoa. - Cool sad guy costume. - Hilarious. I'm going home. Why should I stay someplace everyone hates me? Nobody hates you. You know, just, uh... just all the women. But come on, my man, A sloppy office party is the perfect night to change all that. I hate Halloween. It's a stupid, pagan holiday that celebrates witches, which are basically chick doctors. Anyway, I don't have a costume or anything, so, like, whatever. We can fix that, big guy. Uh, hold on. Um... All right, one of my Coogi sweaters and... ooh, a tray of Jell-o shots. Zip-zop, bippity bop. Theo, Denise, Rudy, Vanessa. You are now America's favorite dad, hero of the black community, Dr. Bill Cosby. He is a super guy. - Okay, I'll stay. - Yes! - Dawn. - Yeah? Are you really gonna do that shit with the AASF money? You used to do all kinds of shit with everybody's money. The Jammer Group was founded on shit. Besides, you heard him. No one's ever gonna know. You will. Dawn, you are not me or Blair. You wanna act like a tough chick, but I know you were all torn up about all the people you hurt on Black Monday. Come on. Don't let Blair drag you down. Fuck. You're right. Fine, I'll just... I'll tell Blair to trade with his own accounts. I'm sure it will be a big enough win to hold us over until we get the bailout. Thanks, Momo. You know I'm looking out for you. Yeah. Connie, it's Mo, listen. It's all going down at the TBD Halloween party tonight, and it's the exact kind of huge shit that you've been looking for so you can leverage Blair into a confession, okay? You can get him, and I can get back to my life. Finally. You know, Mo, for what it's worth, I'm happy for you. Believe it or not, I want you to be free. Aw, Connie. And I want you to go fuck yourself. Let me guess, Aisha, you're not coming to dinner with my folks. Babe, I can finish this case tonight. Let's fucking party! ♪ I'm kicking into overdrive ♪ ♪ Gonna leave it all behind ♪ - Hi. - Whoo. - Oh. Hey, how are you? Are you okay? You've been here for, like, ten seconds and you're already wasted. Well, I've been drinking since my morning meetings... - yesterday. - Meetings? Finally brought my Pfaffshion samples around town. Well, how did it go? It was terrible, you idiot. Sorry. It's just no one wants denim on their glasses. Who am I kidding? I'm not a fashion designer. I don't know what I am. I'm having a quarter-life crisis. Well, I don't know if you're gonna make it - into your 130s, baber. - Exactly, life is short. Hey, hey, what did I promise you the night I proposed this partnership? I swore to you that we would be the biggest power couple in New York, nay, the world, and we are about to be after tonight as long as we keep working together. Tiff, you don't have to be anything except Mrs. Pfaff. You're Mrs. Pfaff. - Enjoy it, babe. - Blair. Oh, hi. Uh, uh, Tiff, this is Congressman Harris and his daughter, I think. No, this is his wife, Corkie. It's nice to meet you, Tiff. Blair. Uh, it's nice to meet you both. That's a great costume. Let me guess. You are Huey Lewis from Back to the Future. Nope, I'm a fourth grade teacher. So lame, right? - Yeah, 'cause you are a... - A high school teacher. Oh. Blair, before we party, I really need to discuss some business with you, privately. I... I need to handle a big piece of your business. My business is urgent. Oh, you can't wait to do business? Well, let's do it in my office. Come on, now, Dada. Please don't leave me alone at another party while you go off with the boys. Hey, let... let him go. You know what? If Blair does business with the Congressman the way he used to with me, they'll be back - before you know it. - Ouch. Come on, we can make our own fun. Want a drink? Oh, no. I don't drink. Do you like to watch? - Oh, my gosh. Whoo! Feed me! God damn it, Keith. What do you want? Info... all of it. I don't have any info... What is that smell? Ugh, someone peed on me. Look, I know something big is going down tonight. Is it a trade or a deal... what? Only thing going down tonight is my boogie. Tell me or I'm gonna tell Dawn and Blair it was you who blew up their bank deal by blowing up AmeriSavings. The same AmeriSavings blowup that you were a part of? What are you doing here? Who are you working for? - Really? - What? - Whoa, cool costume. - Get the fuck out of my face. Whoa. Ow! Aw, your highness, I am so glad you could make it. I wouldn't miss it, your flyness. You look amazing. Would it be inappropriate if I asked you... To dance. To dance... yeah, I asked first, so, you know, there it is. I'm pretty sure I just did. Uh, you didn't hear me just say it? I believe I was about to do this. - No, I just asked... - Must be nice. Yeah. So if you don't drink, what do you do with yourself when your husband's off doing business? - These help. - Ooh. - May I? - Oh, yes, please. Yeah, those are... Valium, dexies, benzo fury. What's that one? Giraffe laxative. - For your figure? - You ever seen a fat giraffe? - You really know your pills. - So do you. Mother's little helper... Is what my mom called me when I'd go fetch her pills. You know, maybe I will have some punch. I mean, Jesus drank wine, right? Yes, and I think there's... Oop... wine in this. Give her a try. Ooh, don't mind if I do. Eenie, meenie, minie. - Cheers. I hope I don't shit myself all night. You might. There's only one way to settle this, playboy. Name it and claim it. How about a dance battle, Akeem? Let's go, Akeem. - Was that his accent? - That is his accent. No, it's more like this. No, that's what I'm doing, Akeem. - No, Akeem, I'm doing it. - No, Akeem... You're doing some broken down thing... You sound like Count Dracula. Where are you supposed to be from? I am from Zamunda. Where are you from? Oh, no, I'm from Zamunda. Zamunda, well... That's supposed to be how you pronounce Zamunda? - That's Zamunda? - That's Zamunda? Oh, you meant actual business. Just tell me... Is everything okay with TBD? Yeah, yeah, never better. Why? Well, we just shot a great new spot, but when we went to buy airtime, we ran into a snag. The last three checks that your girl has sent over have had mistakes. Ugh. One wasn't signed, one was dated 1888, and this is just a dry cleaning receipt. Oh, I've been looking for this. If we don't get ILM the 500k we owe them by tomorrow, they're not gonna finish the visual effects. You used Industrial Light and Magic for your political ad? Look, it's gonna be pretty hard for me to push through your precious bank bailout if I'm not a congressman. How about this? How about a blank check? You just fill it out for whatever you need and cash it whenever, tomorrow. All right, y'all, gather round, everyone. Clear the floor for a dance battle. No, we're not battling to "My Prerogative." Why? Bet you already got a bunch of moves worked out to that shit. What? Don't be silly. Now I know you're lying. Everybody's got a routine to "My Prerogative." - He's not lying. - No, they do. ♪ Everybody's talking ♪ ♪ All this stuff about me ♪ ♪ Why don't they just let me live ♪ ♪ Tell me why ♪ ♪ I don't need permission ♪ ♪ Make my own decisions ♪ ♪ That's my prerogative ♪ ♪ It's my prerogative ♪ ♪ I can do what I wanna do ♪ - ♪ It's my ♪ - ♪ It's my ♪ ♪ It's my ♪ ♪ It's my ♪ - ♪ It's my ♪ - ♪ It's my ♪ ♪ My, my, my, my, my ♪ Yeah, knew it.

Okay, all right. - We'll call it a draw. - A draw? Marcus was tap dancing on your soul. Marcus wins. Everybody! Marcus, Marcus! - Knock it off, man. - Marcus, Marcus, Marcus! You know what?

You're not free yet. Not until Blair makes that trade and you get me that disc from the record room. And no funny stuff. My guys are everywhere. Yeah, real imaginative costumes. Oh, shit, the FBI is here. Oh, fuck. Uh, Roger, I have something I need to tell you. I've sort of been... Hmm. What did you wanna tell me? That I'm hot for teacher. - One blank check coming up. You're welcome, ladies! ♪ There's something deep inside you ♪ Yeah! Arrest me, officer! ♪ That you don't want me to see ♪ - Hey, hey, hey... Hey, what the fuck? The fuck is this? I decided to order up some tricks to treat these ladies. Such a double standard. Look, they're objectifying these men. Wayne, chill, it's just for fun. It's bullshit. Fuck Halloween! Wayne. - Oh, yeah! - A different one. - Excuse me! - Whoo! I don't think that tattoo is doing what he thinks it's doing. - Whoo! - Okay, please. Excuse me! Excuse me! Ugh. Good idea. Now you can get whatever you need, and I can get whatever I need. Not here, it's too risky. Okay. I know the perfect spot. All right. I gotta be honest, when you came back... I was like, "here we go again." Mo' Mo, mo' problems, but you've really changed. You know, you're different. Hold up. I got you a gift. Ah, Church's Chicken. Don't think I forgot it was just your birthday. I can't believe you didn't throw yourself a big party to not show up to. Uh, I told you, really, I'm done with that stuff. Wow, humble, coke-free. - Who are you? - Oh, yeah, um... - What? Just, um, remind me to destroy that disc at, like, 2:15 after Blair executes the trade. I don't wanna go to jail 'cause I fell into a sex coma. Um, why would you go to jail if Blair's doing this whole thing by himself? Oh, stop talking. Wait a minute, Dawn, Dawn, Dawn. Did Blair convince you to use those AASF funds after all? Are you being serious right now? - Yeah. - Yes. But he didn't convince me. I reassessed the trade, and we're gonna pull the trigger. It's worth the risk. Why do I always have to be the moral one? Come on, konnichi wa, bitches. Now come on. Are we doing this or not? Dawn, I told you to trust me. And why the fuck would I do that, huh? After all the times that you fucked me over in the past? Here I am trying to throw you a bone, and you're bitching about a trade? You're throwing me a bone? Bruh, I'm trying to christen the server room. I... - Sorry, I... - Really? Okay. Locked? Damn it! Oh, fuck the keypad. Four-digit code? How many combos can there be? One, one, one, one. Ugh. One, one, one, two. Uh... Okay, ah, uh. Whoa, what the hell? Hey, I was just looking for you, boo. Get it... boo? Ha-ha-ha. Shouldn't you be in the server room so you can grab the disc? Oh, uh, turns out I was wrong. No trade going down tonight, so you guys can go. - Good job anyway. - Really? So Blair's not shorting the yen based on insider information? How'd you know that? We planted that bullshit on the Congressman knowing Blair would take the bait Tonight's our best shot to grab Blair by the balls or we might just have to shift our focus to Dawn. I told you, okay? There's nothing there. Why don't you have Keith do it? I know he's working for you guys too. What? Keith's working for Larry Leighman. Now go get me evidence of Blair making that trade or it's Dawn's ass. Why you bald-headed, roller blading, coke addict motherfucker. ♪ In the ghetto ♪ ♪ Stop, point, freeze now ♪ ♪ Come on, get tough on the street ♪ ♪ Get tough with the gang ♪ ♪ Watch your back, it's a hardcore thing ♪ ♪ In the ghetto ♪ ♪ There's no surprise... ♪ All right, look, Keith, let's let bygones be bygones, okay? Why are you talking to a plant? Oh. Look, let's let bygones be bygones, okay? I want to let you in on a top secret trade. Ooh, feed me. I'm all ears. Larry, it's Keith. Short the yen right now, okay? Reagan's dropping major tariffs on Japan. Hit it big, and you'll suck up all the profit and fuck over TBD in the process. Trust me. You done good, Keithy. - You done good. Oh, Tiff, I had fun with you tonight. - I did. - Me too, Corkie. You're fun, Corks. - Yeah. I gotta get up, - Ugh. - I feel a little dizzy. - Me too. I feel a little dizzy. Ugh, okay. We gotta get up. - Careful. - Oh, boy. Are those Skants? Skirt on the outside, pants on the underside? Oh, yes, but we call them "pirts." Very popular with all of my Evangelical friends. The comfort of pants with none of the harlotry. I thought nobody liked those. I mean, you know, I have pallets and pallets. I don't know what to do with 'em. 'Cause they're all that's left of my family business. Hey... No, sorry to bring the mood down. - No, you're okay. - It's been hard. Oh, wow. It sure has, hasn't it? It's just been a hard time. You know? - I just had an idea. - What? You know, business isn't just for the guys anymore. - We should do lady business. - Ooh. Oh, no. Sorry. Y-you meant actual business. Misread that. You know what? Yes, I'm in. To lady business! - No. - Okay. - I just love to... - Fuck. I was gonna say, "lie here with you," - but that too. - Something wrong? - What the... No, I was just gonna make a trade in a couple minutes. But it's already somehow moving against me. - Fuck. Fuck. We're stuck in here for 17 minutes? What the fuck? What trade were you trying to make? Uh, just, like, you know, stocks. Wayne, buddy, you are not gonna believe this, but this beautiful woman is dying to meet you. Wayne Lapotka? I've been wanting to talk to you all night. Is this happening? After all the promises my ex-wife broke and all the computers I broke trying to Weird Science a replacement for her, it made me turn on women. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe women aren't the enemy. You've been served. Did Just For Men serve you for stealing their name. - God damn it. - Oh, my God! As long as we're stuck in here, I've been dying to show you the new commercial. Great. During Roger Harris' first term in Congress, he chaired the House Ethics Committee, coined the term... I'm sorry... remind me why this was $3 million? Those Star Wars guys take star wipes very seriously. And that VO is just temp, but we're out to Scott Baio. - Cool. - Yeah? Huh? I'm Roger Harris, and I'm running for Congress. - Looks great. - Yeah? - Yeah, it looks really great. - Mmm. Scott Baio. What'd you do, Mo? Hm? Did you leak our trade? Huh, sounds like you didn't get in on time. - What the fuck did you do? - I saved your ass, Dawn. That trade's gonna blow up as soon as the U.S. market's open. Now, if you're smart, you get on the other side and buy the yen right now before the Nikkei closes. I don't need you to save my ass. I don't need anyone's fucking help. I came up with Black Monday! The whole thing... It was my idea! - Dawn Darcy! - Okay, listen. You may want to stop screaming that shit. And you might wanna stop telling me what to stop screaming. - Hm? - Yeah, that's it. Okay, look, will you just trust me please? If you want me to trust you, then do something that's trustworthy for once. I just did, An odd rumor swept across Wall Street last night driving the yen through the floor... Quickly disproven at the opening bell. - The Japanese currency immediately shot through the roof, already higher than yesterday's close. You fucked us. You fucked us. We lost millions. I knew it. Ugh, you're still working with Mo and those little devils, aren't you? Whoa, whoa, Mo fucked us both again, but it's gonna be worth it, okay? 'Cause I got enough information last night to fuck everybody. You'd be surprised how people let their guard down in front of the houseplant. It's the exact kind of huge shit that you've been looking for so you can leverage Blair into a confession. I came up with Black Monday! Me! It was my idea! Hey, hey, what the fuck, man? I'm a person. My bad, my bad. Trust me, I got this. You better. You fucking better. Otherwise I'm sending you back to the big house and your wife to the poor house and me to the fucking House of Pancakes. I'm bad off the dribble. Fuck. - Fuck. And the yen continues its historic rise. - I know what you did. - What? You found out Dawn was gonna be a part of Blair's illegal trade, so you used Keith to tip off the rest of the street so they couldn't get in in time. What makes you think that? 'Cause not only did they not get short, somehow, Dawn had the brilliant idea to get long. Almost as if someone told her the trade would blow up at the bell. Huh. Your girlfriend just made $9 million. And wouldn't you know... It happens to be a totally legal trade. Wow, that's amazing, but I still don't know what you're talking about, boss. And I don't know what you smiling about, motherfucker, 'cause this changes everything. Our deal is fucking off. How is our deal fucking off? For some shit that I didn't... Hey, Mo. Oh, Dede. Oh, I-I'm sorry. I didn't realize... - No, no, no, it's not... - No, no, no, no, no. I told you. Don't worry about it. - She'll understand, baby. - Uh, yeah. No, I'm really happy for you guys. Ooh, Lord, what the hell was in that punch? I ain't black out like that since I crossed Alpha Gamma Psi. - You know! Y'all Wall Street people know how to party. Hey, Marcus, you know what? I actually... I would really like to go on that date. - Did I ask you out on a date? - Yes. Ooh, dope. You know what? I just had the best idea. Double date. Yeah, I mean, Dawn, there is so much I want to learn about you. Great. - Great. - Great. Yeah, great. This means war.
