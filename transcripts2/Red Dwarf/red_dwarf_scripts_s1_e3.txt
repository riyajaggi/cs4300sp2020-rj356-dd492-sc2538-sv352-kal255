 This is an 505 distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf. The crew are dead killed by a radiation leak. The only survivors were Dave Lister, who was in suspended animation during the disaster, and his pregnant cat, who was safely sealed in the hold. Revived three million years later, Lister's only companions are a life form who evolved from his cat and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew. In the three million years we've been away, it is my fond hope that mankind has abolished war, cured all disease and got rid of those little Western saloon doors

 you get in trendy clothes shops. One hundred and forty thousand rehydratable chickens. Check. Seventy-two tons of reconstituted sausage patty. Check. Four thousand six hundred and ninety-one irradiated haggis. Rimmer, it's Saturday night. I've had enough. Four thousand six hundred and ninety-one irradiated haggis. Rimmer, it's Saturday night. I want to boogie on down. Four thousand six hundred and ninety-one irradiated haggis. We've been doing this for four hours. Let's have a break. Four thousand six hundred and ninety-one irradiated haggis. Rimmer, will you stop saying "4,981 irradiated haggis" and speak to me? Four thousand six hundred and ninety-one irradiated haggis.

 Rimmer, I want to go for a drink. Four thousand six hundred and ninety-one irradiated haggis. - I want to have some fun. - This is fun. Are you mad? You read something out, I say "check." Where's the fun? All right. We'll put you in command for a few seconds, Cap-i-tan. What's the plan, sir? Come on, lickety-split. - Go back to Earth. - And in the meantime? I don't know, generally slob around, have a few laughs. Excellent plan, Lister. Excellent plan. Brilliant plan. There was me thinking you hadn't thought about it, when clearly you have. Right, I'll just stand over here and laugh slobbily, shall I? Well, I'm going for a drink. Give me me cigarettes. - I only owe you four and three quarters. - You owe me five. It's one cigarette for each day you obey me. Well, there you go. Five days, five cigarettes. Ah, but I'm penalising you a quarter of a cigarette for saying "check" in a variety of silly voices, - while doing the homogenised puddings. - Well, I'm taking five. You take five, Lister, I'll eject the rest of the ship's stock into space. Ha, ha, ha, ha! So they're somewhere near an airlock? Ha, ha, ha, ha. You'll never find them, Lister. I was always a master at Hide and Seek as a child. It's not a gift you lose. - Okay, quark brain. - Even it out. Take out the flaky bits. Oh, I really, really hate you, Rimmer. Have a lovely, lovely time, Lister. Give my regards to the air. Lights. Holly, why Rimmer as a hologram? Why did you have to bring Rimmer's hologram back? He was the most unpopular man on board this ship. I mean, he even had to organise his own surprise birthday parties. - Who should I have brought back, then? - Anyone. Chen, Petersen. I mean, Hermann Goring would have been more of a laugh than Rimmer. I mean, okay, he was a drug-crazed transvestite, but at least we could have gone dancing. Water. I brought Rimmer back because he's the best person to keep you sane. Oh, crap. Not you. I do apologise. I wasn't paying attention. See you later. What about Kristine Kochanski? You could have brought Kristine back. Your entire life, your shared conversations with her totalled 773 words. - So? - In terms of wordage, you actually had a better relationship with your rubber plant. I know, but Rimmer! He '5 the person you knew best. Over 74 million words in all. Holly, seven million of those were me telling him to smeg off and the other seven million were him putting me on report - for telling him to smeg off. Jean-Paul Sartre said ”Hell was being locked forever in a room with your friends. ” Holly, all his mates were French. I have been to Titan, I have been to Juno, I can name eight things that go in jars that you know. Pickles. Jam. Spaghetti. - Brains. - Ugh! What, in jars? Well, me uncle's brain's in a jar. It's really sad. - Why is it sad? - He's not dead yet. Right, everybody's punished. Finish your drinks. Could you move, please? Excuse me? Some of us have more important things to do than wiggle our posteriors. Could you move, please, please? Thank you. Could you move? Excuse me, please. Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Excuse me. If you want to dance, do it over there. - Oi! - Sorry. That woman's out of your league. She's just too classy for you. - Who is she? - Kochanski. I've got no big thing about Kochanski. Stick to your usual type. Women with little wispy beards who wear three overcoats and carry little bags full of string. - Kristine Kochanski? - Shut up. What, Officer Kristine Kochanski? Selby! Have you ever eaten a coconut whole? Nah, you've no chance with her. You're just too ugly. Listen, half-drum head, I've got no big thing about Kristine Kochanski. - I have. - So have I. Whoa. - Lister, where's my revision timetable? - It's Saturday night! Come on, no one works Saturday night. You don't work any night, you don't work any day. Skive hard, play hard. That's our motto. Look, I've got my engineering resit on Monday. I don't know anything. Where's my revision timetable? Wait, is this the thing in all different colours with all the subjects divided into study periods and rest periods, - and self-testing times? - It took me seven weeks to make it. I've got to cram my whole revision into one night. Hang on, is this the thing with the note on it in red that said, "Vital, valuable, urgent. Do not touch on pain of death?" - Yes. - I threw It away. - Ha, ha. Tee-hee. Where is it? - No, Rimsy. I pinned it up on the wall. - What? Why? - To dry it out. - What do you mean, dry it out? - Well, I spilt a goat vindaloo on it. Don't worry, it's a little bit red, but you can read most of it. Especially if you scrape the lumps off. You spoilt my... No, I haven't got time. I'm taking learning drugs and all I'm memorising is this conversation. - They're illegal. - Where's my revision timetable, Lister? It's Saturday night. No one works Saturday night. You don't work any night, you don't work any day. Skive hard, play hard. That's my motto. Lister, where is my revision timetable? It's Saturday night, no one works Saturday night... I've been to Titan, I've been to Melanski. I can name 90 men who've slept with Kochanski. - Me. - Me. - Mel - The London jet juniors! - The service droids! - My mother! Okay, leave it alone. Leave it. Alone. Argh! Ow! Ooh, baby. Hey. Jump back. Come back. Hey. How am I looking? I'm looking nice. My hair is nice, my face is nice, my suit is nice. I'm looking really nice. Ow! Jump back! Ooh. Ah! Hey. Get down. Wonder how I'm looking now? Still looking nice. My hair is still nice. My face is still nice. My suit's... I'm just nice, period. Jump back. Get down. Ooh, heh! Good evening, you stupid, stinking, festering gimboid of a cat. Ah, you're going to put these cigarettes back, aren't you? Are you crazy? This is my all-time best lucky find I ever found in the whole of today. No, no, no. You are going to put these cigarettes back quickly before he comes. - These are mine! - They're not yours. Put them back. See this hand? It is mine. See these things? They are mine. - I'll give you a fish. - One fish? Ha. - Two fish. - For all these shiny things? I'll show you how to get all the fish you'll ever need. - Five fish? - Mmm. - Five fish. I'll be rich. - You certainly will. Yes, come on. All right! Hey, hey, hey... Five fish? - Six fish. - Oh! ♪ Oh, dance, dance, dance... ♪ Lister, what on Titan is this din? Lister! - What on Titan is this din? - It's Rasta Billy Skank. Is this it? It's got a health warning on it, you know, it's bad for you. - It's a classic. - "Danger. Government health warning. "This music can make you irritable and irrational "and has been linked with disorders of the nervous system and bowels." No one takes any notice of that stuff. Lister, if you want to dice with death, fine, but don't poison my sound waves. Off. Why don't you listen to something really classical like Mozart, Mendelssohn or Motorhead? I think I've gone video blind. Is that painting yours? It's rubbish. It's a mirror. I need some sleep. Rimmer, do you, erm... Do you remember Kristine Kochanski? Navigation Officer? Yes. I remember her. Snooty cow. She used to look down on me. She used to call me Rimmer. Everybody called you Rimmer. It's the way she said it, though. "Rimmer." Rimmer, to rhyme with scum. God, she had a chip on her shoulder, Lister. Oh, yeah. Well, I want to go on a date with her. Tough. She's dead. - Just one night. - No. - I want to turn you off. - No. - For just four hours. - No. - And spend an evening with her hologram. - Nope. Look, I know you're worried I won't turn you back on. - No. - But I promise, I swear, if you tell me where you've hidden the hologram disks... - No. - Oh! - You're not even prepared to discuss it. - We are discussing it, Lister. What's this if it's not a discussion? A diesel locomotive? Rimmer, I promise, I swear, I'll turn you back on. Is that it, Lister? Is that the entire proposal? - Yes. - Well, Lister... No. Think about it seriously. Don't just dismiss it. All right, all right. I'll think about it. - You're just gonna say no. - Don't interrupt. I'm thinking about it. - But you're just gonna say no. - Not necessarily. I'm mulling it over. Yeee... No. But what is it, man? Don't you trust me? Black card, Lister. I'm holding up a black card. Conversation over. I've always been crazy about her and I never did anything about it. Oh, Lister, you've forgotten the colour code. White. The white card is to continue the discussion. But this is a black card situation. Discussion over. - Listen. - ♪ Black card, black card ♪ - I was talking about something else. - White card. Go on. For a start, I want to stop all this black card and white card, smeg, - it's driving me crazy. - Black card. Oh! Four hours, just... I want to spend an evening with her hologram! What's so wrong with that? You don't know when to stop, do you, Lister? I'm your superior. Technician was the lowest rank on the ship. The man who changed the bog rolls was higher than us. Yes, well, he's not here now, Lister, and we are. And there's still a pecking order and I'm pecking you, baby. Okay, Rimmer. Okay. - Okay? - Okay. - Is that a threat, Lister? - Yeah. Actually, "Okay", Lister, is not a threat, technically speaking. It is when you mean it to mean what I mean it to mean. And I mean it to mean, "Okay, Rimmer. Okay." No, Lister, "Okay" is never a threat, no matter how many AYs you put on the end. I'm going to pass the exams and become an officer. Oh, come on. Wise up, Lister. You'll have to salute me, Rimmer. You'll have to call me, sir. You'll have to give me Kochanski and me cigarettes. And on that day, Lister, Satan will be skating to work. Lister! Rise and shine, El Slotho. Come on. I've been awake for hours, Lister. Up, up, up. Come on. Exercise, Lister. Exercise, sonny boy. Quarter to 2:00? I didn't set my motivator. I was supposed to be up at 7:00. Why didn't he wake me? He knows I'm a heavy sleeper. Have I got to remind him to do everything for me? He's so irresponsible. Holly, give me a cold shower, will you, please? Certainly, Arnold. Not that cold. Hotter, hotter. Not that hot. Just forget it. Can you give me a clean uniform? Perhaps you can manage that? Thank you, Holly. Where's Lister? Holly, where's my arm? This isn't my arm. Whose arm is this? I 'm sorry, Arnold. Your physical data disk has become corrupted Don't give me excuses. Give me my arm back. I'll have to refresh the graphics from a back-up. It's got tattoos. Candy, Denmark Forever. Is this Petersen's arm, Holly? I've got the arm of a Danish moron. If you '11 just bear with me for a few minutes, Arnold. It's not good enough, Holly. It's traumatic enough being dead. And whose ears are these, Holly? They're like two giant radar dishes stuck higgledy-piggledy to the side of my head. I mean, just look at them, look at them. Whose were these ea rs, Holly, an African elephant? - They're your ears, Arnold. - It must have been the way I slept. I haven't got time for this. Where's Lister? That information is security protected. What's he doing? Mmm-mmm. - Hello. How can I help you? - Fish. Today's fish is trout a la creme. - Enjoy your meal. - Fish! Today's fish is trout a la creme. - Enjoy your meal. - Fish! Today's fish is trout a la creme. - Enjoy your meal. - Fish! Today's fish is trout a la creme. - Enjoy your meal. - Fish! Today's fish is trout a la creme. - Enjoy your meal. - Fish! Today's fish is trout a la creme. - Enjoy your meal. - I will! - Lister? Where's Lister? - No, man. The fish is mine. I don't want your fish, you stupid cat. Where's Lister? Idiot. Holly, as senior rank aboard this ship, I order you to tell me where he is. - I've told you, I can 't. - Holly, that's an order. - You stupid, ugly goit. - Ugly? I 'II have you know, I chose this face out of the billions available, 'cause it happened to be the face of the greatest and most prolific lo ver who ever lived. Really? Well, he must have operated in the dark a lot. You what? And when are you gonna give me my own arm back? I refuse to walk round all day with Petersen's arm. You know what he was like. God only knows where this arm has been. Ah. What's he doing? Beats me, Amie. Seems to have a mind of its own. - Tell him to stop it. - What is this? A cabaret? Entertainment while you eat? No, no, no! Hey, can you place bets? My bet is on this arm. Argh! Holly, you're absolutely gorgeous and handsome and delicious. Please tell him to stop it. All right. just give me a couple of seconds. Ah, look at that. I've outwitted him. He's given up. Look, he's given up. Oh! There, done it. just in time. Hey, that was good. You should've finished on a song. It would have been perfect. I hate everything. Where is Lister, the little worm? Lister? Listie, Listie, Wistie, Lister? I know you're here, Lister. You're always here Sunday afternoons. What are you two doing here? Skutters don't have time off. You really must think I'm stupid. I'll deal with you two later. You're serious about this, Lister, aren't you? - Go away. I'm busy. - Off. You seriously believe a piece of fungus like you has got the stuff to become an officer? You've got the brains of diarrhoea and the breeding of a maggot. I mean, what are you writing on, Lister? The inside of a chocolate wrapper? I mean, come on. Where's your loose-leaf file? Where's your pencils, where's your protractor and your hole reinforcers? Rimmer, I'm going to pass this exam by knowing things. - Okay. What's a porous circuit? - Don't know. How do you calculate acceleration? - Don't know. - Oh, this is sad. What's Boyle's Fourth Law? Don't eat greasy food. These are basic engineering precepts, Lister. How do you expect to pass the engineering exam? I don't. I expect to pass the chef's exam. You want to become a chef? Not really. I just want to become your superior. But a chef? A white-hatted ponce? That's not a real officer. It outranks you, smeg-for-brains. And, Lister, what's this? Learning drugs? They're illegal, matey. I'm afraid you're in very serious, grave, deep trouble, Lister. Where did you get them? I want names, I want places, I want dates. Arnold Rimmer. His locker. This morning. Why am I worried? You'll never stick at it. You'll never pass. Say, "You'll never pass, Mr Lister, sir." Practise, Rimmer, makes perfect. Question four, underline that. What does the red spectrum tell us about quasars? I'm gonna die. I've been fished to death. My answer, in answering the question, what does the red spectrum tell us about quasars... Write bigger. There are various words that need to be defined. What is a spectrum? What is a red one? Why is it red? And why is it so frequently linked with quasars? What the hell is a quasar? Just put a neat cross through it. We'll do the next one. Okay? And I think that confidently and concisely answers the question, what does the red spectrum tell us about quasars. - Da-da! - Lister, did you make that? Yeah. It's not that good. It was supposed to be roast beef. Do you want some, Cat? It's got some real cream and fudge in it. I think I'm going to have to go and do something secret. Look out. Food escape. - So, Lister, you doing all right, yeah? - Not bad. Not bad at all. Listen, Lister. All this tension between us is stupid. There's just no need for it. I mean, you're tense and I'm tense. And there's just absolutely no need for it. I'm not tense. Of course you're tense, you rectum-faced pygmy. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I mean, there's no need for you to be slogging your guts out. - I'm enjoying it. - Shut up. Doing an exam, doing so well. There's absolutely no need for it, Lister. You can have the cigarettes. They're in pipeline 22. - I know. - Good. The Cat betrayed me. I don't mind. I'm delighted. What I'm saying, Lister, is there's no need for us to be at loggerheads. - I mean, we're mates, we're pals. - When? Oh, come on, Lister. Laugh, laugh, laugh, chuckle, guffaw, giggle. - That's Rimsy and Listy. - When? - Millions of times. - When? Ah! Ah, how about the time your safety harness snapped and you fell into the cargo bay? - We laughed then, didn't we? - I cracked me spine in three places. Yes, but it was hilarious. We laughed like drains. You laughed. I spent six weeks in traction. Yes. That's right and you spent the rest of the summer walking around like a croquet hoop. Oh, I laughed so hard I nearly puked. I really did. What are you saying to me, Rimmer? I'm just saying, Lister, that with times as good as those, there's no point in letting something small and silly like this come between a friendship that we've nurtured like a small flower, petal by petal, and watched blossom and bloom into something rare and special. - Okay, give me Kochanski. - Smeg off, dishwasher breath. You won't turn me back on. What, Rimsy-wimsy-mimsy, me bestest ever pal? All right, Lister. I order you not to take those exams. Black card, Rimmer. You are black carding me? That's only the beginning, Rimmer. When I pass the exams and become an officer, you'll be on latrines. You'll have the 3:00 watch every morning and I know you'll obey me, because you, I mean, you, respect all that officer smeg. If you mean I respect my superiors, no matter who they are, and I obey orders blindly and unquestioningly, yes, yes, I do. That's exactly what I mean. Anyway, I've got to get some sleep. Hard day's revision on the morrow. You always become the thing you hate the most. Look at you, Lister. Obnoxious, ruthless, single-minded, insensitive, you're more like me than I am. Rimmer, you've forgotten the colour code. This is a black card situation, end of conversation. "You never learn, do you?" Will all entrants for the Chef Part One Examination please proceed to the teaching room. You're not ready for it, you know. Look at you. You should be doing last-second revision. I am. I'm revising buns. I mean, it's obscene, missing the entire first minute of the exam. Okay, here we go. No. You can't do this to me, Lister. - Give me Kochanski. - No. That was a lousy thing to do to a hologram. Have you no respect for the dead? Ah. Hello, Dave. I'm just doing this, erm... I'm taking this... This is a surprise. Dave, why didn't you just tell me how you felt about me when I was still alive? 'Cause I'm a dope and I'm a bum, and I'm stupid, and I'm an idiot, and I'm hopeless, and I'm useless. I'm sorry, but I just don't like you. Oh, hey. I'm really embarrassed now. I don't know what to say. I suppose it's sort of pointless you doing the exam now. Well, yeah, it's sort of pointless me breathing in and out if you want to know the truth. I could never love anyone like you. So you might as well pack up your pots and pans and off you go. I need a man who's going places. Up, up, up the ziggurat, lickety-split. So it didn't mean anything to you, then? - What didn't? - You know, when we... Made love on the snooker table behind the bins. - You never told me that. - I thought you might have noticed. - Oh, yes, yes. I remember now. - We've never made love. Go away, Rimmer. Look, look, I'm a bit out of sorts at the moment. - I'm having a woman's period. - A woman's period? Women don't speak like that. Give me a break. I don't know how you've done it, Rimmer, but that is not Kochanski. It's Kochanski's body, it's Kochanski's voice. I mean, what's the difference? Come on. The difference is that you're in there, ugh. - Well, you can't blame me for trying. - I.eave. I've seen something you haven't, squire. Okay, Holly, swap disks. Er, Holly, this is not my breast. I want my own nipple back, Holly. Leave, Rimmer. There's no rush, Holly. Holly, are you sure these are my hips? Lister, 1-6-9-12-14-6. How did you do? How did you do? - How did you do, Lister? - How did I do, Mr Lister, sir! ♪ It's cold outside There's no kind of atmosphere #I'm all alone, more or less ♪ Let me fly far away from here ♪ Fun, fun, fun #ln the sun, sun, sun ♪ I want to lie shipwrecked and comatose ♪ Drinking fresh mango juice ♪ Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes ♪ Fun, fun, fun #ln the sun, sun, sun ♪ Fun, fun, fun ♪ In the sun, sun, sun ♪
