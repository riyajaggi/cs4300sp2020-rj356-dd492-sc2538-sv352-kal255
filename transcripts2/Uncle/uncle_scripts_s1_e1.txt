 'Dear Gwen, 'I had an amazing dream last night. 'We were having a picnic by a waterfall. 'You made us ham and pickle sandwiches 'and I told you they tasted better than Pret, 'which you thought was funny even though I wasn't joking. 'You said I looked handsome and I sang you a song with my guitar, 'which was weird because I didn't remember bringing a guitar, 'but that's dreams for you. 'Then we made love in loads of positions 'but mostly doggie style cos I know that's your favourite.

 If you're listening to this and not answering, I disown you as my brother. That's it. I'm hanging up in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three and a half, three, two, one... This better be good. Shit! Thank God you're there. What took you so long? Nothing. Just watching porn. OK, TMI. Right, can you pick Roly up from school for me? Who? Errol? Your nephew. Oh, right, Errol. Uh, yeah... No! Shit, Andy. When have I ever asked you for anything? Exactly, so why start now? THEY HUSH EACH OTHER Because I've called every responsible person I know and they're all busy. Come on, please, I'm begging you. I'm actually going to hang up now. Andy, wait! Wait! Wait, please. Please. Listen, I've just got out of class and there's no way I can pick him up and get him to football on time. So he misses football. Big deal! Yes, it's a huge deal, actually! He misses football and his dickhead dad finds out, it could ruin the custody case. Oh, come on. Have you really got anything better going on? ELECTRICAL FIZZING MUSIC: "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" by Blue Oyster Cult BELL RINGS Hey. Hey, little fucker. Hi, there. Can I help? Uh, hello, Miss. I'm here to pick up Errol. I'm his uncle. Really? I've not seen you before. You could just be some weirdo looking to steal young boys, for all I know. Sorry, I'm joking. Your sister called to say you'd be coming. I couldn't resist. Roly, your uncle's here for you! I didn't know Roly had an uncle. Are you two close? Yeah, yeah. We're like best mates. I'm like a second dad to him. Take him out for pizza all the time... I thought he was allergic to wheat. He is, but I know a little place that is wheat-free all the way. Right. He reminds me a lot of myself at that age. I mean, not as good looking, obviously. Obviously. Takes his time packing, doesn't he? THEY CHUCKLE AWKWARDLY So, what do you do? I'm a musician. Oh, musical family. Roly's quite the piano player, isn't he? Is he? I mean, yes, he is.. I mean, I taught him everything I know, so he should be. So, what do you do? I'm a teacher. Oh, yes, of course. Just checking! Hey, mate. Up top! That is classic Roly. He is always missing the high five. My name's Andy, by the way. Melodie. Melodie? That's got a nice ring to it. Bye...Bye, then. Come on, I haven't got all day. IN HIGH, GRATING VOICE: "Hi, Uncle Andy. "Thanks for picking me up. "I'm sure you've got lots of more important things "to be getting on with." Why couldn't Mum pick me up? Because she's dead. I've come to take you to identify the body. That's not funny. Well, I'm only a chauffeur, I'm not a bloody comedian. Come on! Do you mind? I'm allergic to cigarettes. Since when? Since my whole life. So, Roly... Don't call me that. Fine, Errol. Are you any good at football? You don't have to do this. Do what? Make small talk. We could just not talk. Fine. That's absolutely fine by me. We'll just sit in silence. That's great. We'll just sit here in silence, not talking. OK, what are you doing? I'm counting how long it'll take you to start talking again. Yeah, great. OK, brilliant. We don't need to do small talk. Let's jump straight into the big stuff. Do you have a girlfriend? No. You have to be in love to have a girlfriend. Let me tell you about love. When you're in love, it feels like you're walking on water, and then you realise, "Oh, hang on, I'm not walking on water, "I'm actually drowning." Then a shark bites off your foot and you go, "AH! AH! MY FOOT!" Then another shark comes along and it goes straight for your cock and balls! And you're going "Save me! Somebody, save me!" Then a seagull plucks you out of the water and you think, "I'm saved! I'm saved!" and then he drops you on to the jagged rocks and you explode like a rotten watermelon and there's blood and guts and broken bones everywhere and you think "Well, at least it couldn't get any worse." And then that is when the hyenas come along and eat you up and you know what you end up being then, Errol? Do you know what you end up being then? Just a steaming pile of hyena shit. That's love. You want to lighten up, mate. Get some of that down you. No, thanks. As your uncle, I command you. Uncle(!) What's so funny about that? When's my birthday? June... J-Ju... March 2nd. Fine! I'm no good with dates and details but I'm good at the big stuff. What's my middle name? Come on. This one's easy. Is it Errol? You think my name's Errol Errol? All right, fine. You think that I have shown a distinct lack of interest in your life up till now and you'll be right. I find you incredibly tedious and dull. But what have you ever done that's interesting? That's the problem with kids today - they think everything they do is interesting. "Oh, look at me with my cool allergies "and my-my...wheelie backpack." What's interesting about that? Nothing! I'm a musician. That's interesting. My dad says "musician" is just another word for "unemployed." Your dad's hardly an altar boy. Do you even know how your parents met? They met through their dealer. His name was "Eclypse", if memory serves me correctly. What do you mean by "dealer?" You know, drug dealer. Like a pharmacist? Yeah, like a pharmacist. Like a pharmacist who borrows your DVDs. MOBILE RINGS You can't answer while driving, it's illegal. Hello? Hey, how are my two favourite boys? Yeah, we're getting on like a fucking house on fire. Oh, that's great. Listen - little change of plan. I thought I'd be done by now but I have a meeting with my professor. So, um, do you mind bringing Roly home after the game? TYRES SCREECH Shit! I know, I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you, I swear. Yeah, that's absolutely great. Yes. Um, bye. Thank you. Fucking hell! Get out the car. Hi. That-that wasn't my fault... Get out of the car now. It was his fault. What?! No, it wasn't! Yeah. He covered my eyes while I was driving. I couldn't see. Kids, eh? Are you a family man? Get out or I'll pull you out. OK, well... You take a couple of steps back and then I can get out the car and we can discuss this like a couple of civilised... Oi! Fuck off, you fuck-faced fuck! Stop that car! Fucking wanker! I'm telling mum about this. She's going to kill you. Yeah, not if I beat her to it. Come on! Someone get on him! That's it, take him! Take him! Nice dive, Tom Daley! Boo! Save it for the Oscars! Suck it up, you pussy! Oh, look, it's Wayne Puny! I've seen better ball handling from a priest! Yellow card for time wasting! Red card for being shit! We're not being too harsh, are we? Nah, it's character building. Which one's yours, then? Uh...that one. That's my little girl, Tiffany. Isn't she something? Yeah, she's certainly something. Can I have some water, please? I'm really parched. What's this? "Ask a stranger for water day?" Get your own water! I feel sorry for his parents. Do you fancy a smoke? Oh, no, my wife made me give up the ol' cigarettes. No. I mean like a "smoke". WHISTLE BLOWS This is exactly what I needed. Happy to help. Do you know what we are? What? We're the cool dads. Yeah, that's what we are. It's Bruce, by the way. Andy. So, what do you do, Andy? I'm a musician. What? No way! Rock 'n' roll, man. Have I heard anything of yours? You know the CottonCare toilet paper adverts? Yeah! With the giant stuffed bears having that pillow fight? Yeah, I wrote the jingle for that. That's cool. Yeah, it is. What do you do? I have the greatest job in the world. You're a porn star? All right, second greatest job. I'm a stay-at-home dad. So, Tiffany, she's yours then, is she? Yep. That big blonde Viking girl over there is yours? Yep. How does that work, then? I'm her step-dad. But do you know why they call it a step-dad? No, why? Cos I'd step in front of a bus for that girl. I don't think I'd step in front of a slow-moving bike for anyone. Oh, wheelie backpack, nice. I've been thinking of getting Tiff one of these. PHONE RINGS It's Gwen! Hello? Gwen? Gwen? Hello? What the fuck? Hello, Gwen? Uh... I've got to go. Come on! Let's go. But the game's not over. Fine. I'll give you 20 quid. Ah! My leg! It's broken. It's broken! I think it's my fibula! Oh, no! Not your fibula! Weak fibulas run in our family. I better take you to a hospital. Make way! He's deceptively heavy! Get in! Where are we? I thought you were taking me home. Wait here. I'll be back in a few minutes. Take me home or I'm telling Mum. Fine. Tell her what you like. CRYING: "Mummy! "Uncle Andy touched my special equipment." Special equipment? You twisted little... Fine, if you tell her that then I am going to show her this! That's not mine. Yeah? It was in your bag. I was keeping it for a friend. Give it back. No! Well, you can tell your friend the lady parts don't go on the front like a coin slot, but asides from that, ten out of ten for accuracy. Now, you wait here like a good little boy and I will give you that back. I hate you. And I hate you too, munchkin. Here you go. Brush up on your anatomy. Happy birthday, mate. Where do you think you're going? Please let me in. My dad's in there. Sorry, son. No kids allowed. Andy, what are you doing here?! What am I doing here? You're the one who phoned me. That was a mistake. I was trying to delete your number. I call it a sign. Yeah, a stop sign. We had a fun few months but it is over. Is this because of the sex tape? Look, I messed up but you understand, I was hammered. Me and the boys were playing truth or dare. They dared me to put it online. They dared me! How did they even know about the tape? Well, that was the truth question. It's not like you could see your face and it was hardly a flattering angle for me either, so... God, I've missed you. We're not back together, Andy. But we were great together. Were we? I mean, OK, the sex was... surprisingly good but I thought there'd be more to you. Some secret layer of maturity hidden under all...that. I'm mature. I watch the Culture Show. Come on, Gwen. I love you. You need to leave before my dad sees you here. I'm not going anywhere until you take me back. HE GRUNTS Come on, Gwen. Just give me one more chance. No. Look at you. You're just too irresponsible. Daddy! Sorry. I had to let him in. That boy can cry. Give me back my drawing. Andy, is this your...son? Y-yes, that's who he is. He's my son. What's your name, darling? Romeo. His name's Romeo. Isn't it? Romeo? Do you mind if me and Romeo just go over here and have a little chat? Is that..? Yep, good. OK, I'm going to give you your drawing back, but you've got to promise me you're going to keep this "daddy" thing going for a little bit longer. Deal? Deal. What is Meatloaf Junior doing in my club? It's OK, Dad. Everything's under control. Hello, Mr Pearson. You're looking lovely today as ever. She's too good for you, do you hear me? Please, not in front of my boy. Dad! Let him go. You hurt my little girl and I will cut your dick off with a spoon. Do you understand? Yes, I-I-I do. Dick. Spoon. You OK? Yep. Thank you. Well, then... I think he's, uh, starting to like me. I don't understand. I've been to your flat loads of times. Where have you been hiding him? Well, every time that you'd come over I'd send him off to my sister's place. Seemed like the responsible thing to do. But why didn't you just tell me? Who wants to go out with a single dad? All that responsibility. Cooking him meals, taking him to football practice and helping him with his homework, looking for monsters under his bed. It just seems like so much... Responsibility? Responsibility, yeah. What happened to his mum? She died in childbirth. Shit. Yep, his head was too big. Ripped her apart like wet paper. I had to stay strong for him, though. Didn't I, little guy? This explains so much. I thought there was something weird, like you had half a personality or something, but I know now. You were hiding this huge thing. You thought I had half a personality? You must be bored listening to us adults talk. Do you want to go in the office and watch some cartoons? He'd love that, wouldn't you, Romeo? No, I hate cartoons. They give me a headache. He's kidding. We watch South Park together all the time. Isn't he a bit young for that? That's right. We watch it on mute. I want more ice cream. Why don't you finish what you've got there, champ? WHISPERING: Get me another scoop or I'll spill the beans... ..Dad. You two are so cute together. MOBILE RINGS I've got to take this. Yes, what is it? Where are you? Um, I am stuck in traffic right now. It looks like there's been an accident. I'm probably going to be at least another hour. Shit! You're joking. You have to be home by six. Roly's Dad is calling. Just tell him to call back later. If Roly misses his dad, it'll break his routine. Have you ever seen a 12-year-old have an OCD meltdown? It's not pretty, Andy. Andy?! Fine, I'll get him back on time. Thank you. Who was that? Just some mum trying to organise a play date. Mums, eh? Oh, is that the time? I better be going. You know, listening to you talk about being a dad... It's actually pretty hot. Yeah, I'd better go. Wait, what? Yeah. Tell me about it. Well... ..he's the greatest thing that ever happened to me. Does he make you want to be a better man? Yes, he does. He makes me want to be Prime Minister. Or, at the very least, the Mayor of London. You've had to sacrifice a lot for him, haven't you? So, so much. But it's all worth it. You know why? Tell me. Cos no matter what I do with the rest of my life, he is my greatest achievement. How's the ice cream? It's OK. I prefer soy ice cream, though. It's funny, you don't look like your dad. That's because the ugly gene is recessive. I think we're going to get on. Why do you dress like that? This is how I feel comfortable. Don't you feel comfortable in what you're wearing? No, this school uniform gives me a rash, but I know what you mean, though. I have this pair of pyjamas that I like so much, I had my mum buy seven pairs of them, one for every day of the week. Uh, I mean my dead mum. How did your parents meet? Their pharmacist introduced them. His name was Eclypse. Are you married? No. I used to be. To Gwen's mum? Mmm-hmm. Did she divorce you because you dress like a lady? You ask a lot of questions. You skip a lot of questions. You ready to go, kiddo? In a bit of a hurry. Where've you two been? Just went outside for a smoke. I love smoking. Your fly's undone. Can I have a word? It's not what you think. My flies are always coming undone and I just think it's a manufacturing problem... Shut up. I know we've had our differences but I also know how hard it is being a single dad. And I have to respect you for the job you've done on your little kid. He's a good boy. Maybe you're not the useless prick I thought you were. Thank you. Hmm. But you still hurt my little girl and I will rip your... Dickspoon. yeah, I got you. All right. We have to go. Do you really? We were having such a nice time. Yeah, I know, but I've got to get this one to a piano lesson. Haven't I, Maestro? Don't touch me. Boundary issues. When can I see you again? Well, that depends. How committed are you to changing? I'll show you how committed I am. Gwen... ..marry me. I'm not his son! He paid me to say I was. Don't listen to him. And my name's not Romeo, it's Errol! What sort of a stupid name is Errol? He's just angry his mum couldn't pick him up from school. You told me his mum was dead? She is. That's part of the problem.

Not your mum, not your dad and especially not me. Why should I go out of my way to keep the Little Prince happy? You'll never be happy. Do you know why? Because it's all about yourself.

No, I've got this amazing professor. He gave me an "A" in my compulsive behaviours essay. He said it was incandescent. Congratulations. He definitely wants to bang you. Oh, God, I hope so, he's really, really fit. Anyway, enough about me - what did you two talk about? Oh, nothing. Women, football. Uncle/nephew-type stuff. You know, you really saved my life today. Well, you'd do the same for me, wouldn't you? So, now uni's started again, do you think you could help out with Roly once in a while? Yeah, if I'm still around. Still around? Where are you going? Nowhere. It's just a figure of speech, isn't it? Look, I'm going to give that back to you cos I don't really know what I'm doing with it. It's not really doing anything for me and I'm going to go. Got a hot date? Yeah, something like that. Oo-ooh! Thank you. Yep. See you. Andrew. I prefer Andy, but what is it? No. That's my middle name - Andrew. I was named after my uncle. Oh. Do you think you can remember that? Yeah... I'll give it a go. You still have my drawing, by the way. No, um... I gave that back to you at the club, remember? No, you didn't. You gave me this.

I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Thank you for picking me up. You're very welcome. Here. That's all right. That's yours, you can keep that. You've earned it. I know, but... if you're going to pick me up again, you're going to need to pay for someone to clean up your car. You're not going to get your car cleaned, are you? No. Mind the cracks.
