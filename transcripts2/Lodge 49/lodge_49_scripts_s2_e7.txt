 I jumped ship. Janet stole your story. It's like she stole your soul. - Trish? - My ex. Wh-What happened to you guys? It was a long time ago. It doesn't matter. She got her own family now. First song I've ever written. It's about you. It was Larry's mom, Jackie Loomis. That's awesome, man.

 And the scrolls are real! Ow! Oh, it's infected. It's a shark tooth! You almost done? Oh, these aren't mine. Nothing in here is mine. Nothing in here is yours. It's all a forgery. Maybe you'll see the real thing someday. Thank you for coming in early. This won't take long. Yeah, Liz, we gotta talk to you about something. Sure, but first I just want to address one small thing. Now, listen, I'm pretty much the last person

 to tell you what's right and wrong. But there is an alarming amount of food being stolen. Like, I get it, but there's got to be some kind of moral limit. - Does there? - Valid point. Again, no judgment on my end. But as manager, I feel obligated to point out that if we steal all the food, we won't be able to stay open as a restaurant. And more importantly, we'll stop getting paid. We're already not getting paid. I know. We've talked about this. The "hospitality included" thing, but that's really Omni's master plan. We'll jack up the menu prices and raise our hourly take-home. No, no, no. We're not getting paid at all. - What? - Our checks bounced. Everyone at the check-cashing place was laughing at me. I was laughing, too, 'cause it was hilarious in a sick, twisted sort of way, like a Goya painting. But still. Yeah, look, did your... did your check bounce, Liz? No. Which makes me look like an evil traitor, so yeah... let me get to the bottom of this, okay? This is my third message, Tarquin. Get your ass over here. - Hey. - Hey. Sorry. I-I didn't mean to get angry at you. Or accuse you of selling us all out. No, I understand. This is awful. It's pretty bad. Um, Gerson went out to Redlands, get some work with his cousin's catering company. What? He never told me. Yeah. Hey, look, we... we've been through a lot together, Liz. We got the affair, the drug freak-out at Orbis... You didn't really have snow in your hair, did you? 'Cause that really would be impossible. Jeremy, um... What is it? Yeah, well, it's kind of embarrassing. I'm broke, too, Liz. Sarah doesn't know it yet, but we're maxed out. I was living paycheck-to-paycheck when rats took over Shamroxx. And now... I'm really trying, Jeremy. I wake up every night from 3:00 to 4:00 worrying about the future. It sucks. That hour lasts for six days. But you know what puts me back to sleep? Half a Tylenol PM and imagining that you're holding me, Liz. You're holding me and Sarah and the baby. Yeah, your... your arms are huge and strong. And they can keep us all safe. Hey! There you are. I woke up early, but you were already gone. I was wandering all night. Oh. Where'd you go? All the satellites up there are mapping the wrong thing. Oh. Dud, I took your shark tooth and made you an amulet. Wow. Blaise... thank you. You fought a monster. But it left something dark inside you that clouded your vision. Yeah, yeah... Um... what do you mean? You were chasing gold. You thought money could solve everyone's problems. Yeah, well, I mean, it would really help you know, having a little, but I'm sorry, I'm listening. No one can deny what we've seen. Hidden rooms. The testament of Jackie Loomis. Our spectacular emergence from the philosophic egg. It's undeniable. You were lost. But now you're not. Right. Yeah. I... Well, I'm... I'm... I'm still a little confused. 'Cause what's our plan exactly? Well, first we have to get back in the lodge. I have some important materials in there. - Purifying agents. - Yeah, I don't know. 'Cause Scott's really serious about your banishment. He's got the whole place on, like, lockdown. We have to accept the exile our knowledge requires. And besides, I'm pretty sure I know how to pick the lock on the back door. Oh. Okay. - These are nice. - Mm. But they might change the vibe a little bit. Exactly. And the new vibe is gonna be fun. Good, normal fun. College football starts this weekend. We're gonna have all the games here. Have you been up to the egg room? Uh, no. Ah, who cares? It's just a waste of space. And I can't really fit in the passageway that leads there. Where is the money coming from for all this? Oh, I'm paying for everything myself. What? I've got savings. I've always been financially responsible. Well, congrats, Scott, you're a better man than me. I don't get commissions anymore, so I'm trying to sell the Caddy just to cover rent. I'm sorry about that, Ernie. But that's... you know, that's... People have to be responsible. I know! I'm just saying that we all have our crap to deal with. No one's asking you to make this kind of sacrifice. Well, this is what leaders do. We sacrifice everything. Even if nobody appreciates it. Okay, look, I haven't seen Connie in a couple of days. And she hasn't said a single word about my song. You been talking to her? No. Gil says she's crashing with Anita. Ohh. It's Blaise. Jesus Christ, Blaise! What are you doing with an axe? Shh! Ernie, call down, okay? We're not here to murder anybody. Scott changed the locks. It was our only way in. - Scott here? - Wh... You're goddamn right I am! - Aah! Hey! - Hey! - Get off me! - Don't struggle! - Don't struggle! - Let go! We're cool? Blaise, you have what you need? - And you're not coming back... - Ever. You're not coming back until we can have some sort of... I don't know... reconciliation meeting, which will be... - Never. - Wow. You're really not seeing it, are you? Seeing what? That he is ruining this place like none of it matters. Hey! You can't talk to me like that, Dud. I'm Sovereign Protector. You know what? You're banished, too. Good! Let's go, Dud. Forget it. They'll never understand. This isn't the lodge anymore. Ernie, when I first knocked on that door, this place felt like magic. Magic? Blaise shot Scott with a nail gun. He broke the back door with an axe. And he ruined my song! Blaise doesn't need magic. He needs... Man, when was the last time you slept? I'll sleep when I wake up. Oh, God... Blaise isn't the problem. You are. You're under a spell, Ernie. It's like my shark tooth. You've got poison inside you, and you need to get it out. I was pleased when Liz called to offer me her gift. Gift? That is what we call complaints. Because any opportunity to maximize our potential is a... gift. Higher Steaks is rewriting the transactional logic of the high-end retail dining experience. And that is why I have been authorized by Janet to deliver to you maybe... maybe... the most important news of your life. Are you going to pay my staff what you owe them? Plus something extra to make up for the hassle? Shh. Even better, Liz. I do not have your paychecks. Because paychecks aren't necessary when you're all... shareholders! Okay, um... Could I have a word with you for a moment, please? Yes, you may. Go ahead. - After you. - No, after you. - No, after you. - No, no, you. They don't need stock in a failing restaurant. You owe them money. I am but a vessel for Janet. I do not have what she does not put into me. So there's no money? The future's far more valuable than whatever small amount of cash might make you feel good in the moment. - Think bigger, Liz. - Tarquin. These people deserve to know what's going to happen here. "These people" are the owners of Higher Steaks! As limited-participation, Class-C, non-voting stockholders. When Higher Steaks succeeds, so will they. But it never will. Because no one who lives around here wants to pay $50 for a steak. Mm. Hey! If you can't handle this, I'll go find Janet. Ha! Nobody gets to Janet. Janet can't be found. Janet is everywhere and nowhere. You tell Janet I'm looking for her! And when I find her, I'm gonna punch her in the face! That was awesome, Liz. iNo pasarán! Higher Steaks will be the graveyard for Omni Capital Partners Food Service West. I'd die for you, Liz. Thanks. But you still don't have paychecks. And I don't know when that's going to happen. Banishment! If Scott thinks that's gonna have any effect on me at all, he is sadly mistaken. I've been banished before. - You have? - This is all so clarifying. No one had seen a lynx in Scotland since the 8th century. But Merrill saw one. In the Year of Our Lord 1843. He was a kid, playing in the snow. It's in the pamphlet. It's why he named the order after the lynx. - It's part of the legend. - Legend? Okay. If you're still thinking that way. Dreams, reality, memory. It's all one thing to a kid. They have pure vision. I have a theory. Anyone can get their hands on the scrolls, but it takes someone truly special to be able to read them. Merrill could, and then he hid them, waiting for the next person, someone worthy. Well, then it's got to be you, Blaise. I mean, you've worked so freakin' hard. I need to purify myself first. Clear my vision. - Right. - And in order to do that, I need to get my hands on some lynx urine. Uhhh... okay. Um... So where are you gonna find lynx urine? I got a lady. You got a lynx-urine lady? I also need to take a long bath with my purifying salts and unguents. Uh... Well, Larry's only got a shower. Hi, Ernie. Hey, Trish. I'm sorry. I-I... I was gonna knock on the door, but I just... I didn't want to bug you. Oh. So you thought you would just loiter around here for a few days? Creep out the neighborhood? This may come as a shock, but you're not very discreet in this. Where's the Caddy? It's dead. I'm trying to sell it. What's going on, Ernie? I was down in Mexico for some stupid reason. I drank a little too much tequila and, um... I had the dream again. That's all. Oh, Ernie... It had been so long. I was usually able to shake it. But not this time. If things had gone different... I keep thinking about that life, with her all the things that should've happened. She'd be finishing college by now. You know what heaven is? It's all the things that should've happened. And we don't live in heaven. We live here. And I'm glad. You should be, too. You said you'd never say her name again. I never have. It's been over 20 years. Right now it feels like yesterday. Say her name, Ernie. I can't. Because if I do, all those dreams I had for her, for us, they... they vanish. Don't. Don't. Don't let yourself fall into this hole, Ernie. I know you. You'll just double down. Make some stupid bet and hoping for a miracle to fix everything. I just mean... find somebody to talk to. I dream about her, too. When I wake up, Mike is there... and the boys. I'm glad. All the stuff you have in your life... it's too late for me. Hey! Want a grilled cheese? Oh, yes. More than anything. Long day in Omni land? - Yeah. - Oh. I am the worst manager in history. Yeah, I doubt that. Oh, hey, Liz... - Oh, my God... - Hi, Liz. Yeah, Blaise is taking a salt bath! Don't freak out! I just need another hour to complete my ablutions. Well, I'm sorry, but I need to go, so... No problem. Don't mind me. I know exactly how you feel. I lived in a commune for a while. Zero privacy. It drove me crazy after awhile. God that was so long ago. Everything feels so far away right now. Hey! Hey! Who's up there? It's just me. Connie? It's... It's not safe. This whole building's a health hazard. It's fine. You should come up and see it. I can't. I'm too big. I can't fit in the passage. Connie, can we talk? Like face-to-face? Please? Of course. Meet me in the library. Aah! Hey. It was beautiful, Scott. Your song. You have so many more songs inside you. It makes me so happy. But it wasn't enough? I've never met anyone like you. What you did for me... it's something I can never repay. You don't have to. I made a promise. I'm a man of my word. And I think it made you miserable. No one should put up with the things you put up with. Scott, you have a higher calling than taking care of me. I think deep down you know it, but it's scary. You'll have to stop worrying about me and worry about yourself. I-I don't understand. I feel like I'm being punished for doing the right thing. What happened to you in London? I fell into a grave. And it felt like the start of things, not the end of things. What the hell does that even mean? I am so sick of everybody talking in riddles! I just mean that I'm done being haunted by the end. There's a different future for both of us. I believe that. Scott... I release you from your duty. Hey! God. Wow. There you are. Were you out wandering all night? Again? Dorothy the Dealer's gonna be here any minute. I realize I don't have any cash for her. Yeah. So lynx urine's pretty expensive, huh? I'm not sure the current market, but, uh, I'm sure we can work something out. Open a line of credit or something. Hey, Blaise, why don't you... why don't you take a nap? Want to take a nap? Just have the bed. No, I'm fine. Don't worry about me. I've had insomnia since I was a kid. It started when I was really little. My parents... yelling at each other all night. Oh. They didn't get along with each other, and they didn't get along with me. The only time they agreed on anything was when they kicked me out of the house. Oh. Um... Blaise, that's terrible. Why? Why do you think? I was the shame of the family. Where'd you go? I just sort of drifted for a while. Like about 30 years. - Hey, Blaise! - Hey! - It's been awhile. - Yeah. Hey, Dorothy, thanks a lot for the rush order. And, um, I was just wondering if maybe you could invoice me for this? 'Cause cashwise, I'm r... Say no more. We'll work it out. I am not in this game for the money. See ya. To cover? No. Moneyline. $500 on the dog. To beat the reigning Pac-12 champion? If you insist. Actually, make it $5,000. Holy shit. Okay. It's in the book. Hey, Luminous Knight. I can't escape you guys. Uh, Blaise took a bubble bath in my apartment yesterday. Oh. Wow. I'm sorry... It's fine. How are you, Liz? Well, I just entered a pawnshop, so... Right. Well, it was... it was good to see you. Dud always has great things to say about you. Oh. I'll leave you to it. Hey. Ernie. Um, I just want to say thank you. For what? For watching out for Dud. Last year, if you'd seen him... it was... it was just a rough time. For both of you. Yeah. I don't really get the lodge, but I'm glad he has somebody. It means a lot to him. Goodbye. Bye. Hello, Burt. It's a beautiful day out there. I thought I'd come in here and inquire about a loan. This was my first night on the news floor. I was 24. No one had time to train me. They just threw me in. An editor handed me proofs and told me to send them down to the printer. He pointed to a pneumatic tube. A-A pneumatic tube? The past is a foreign country, Ross. That's where I come from, unfortunately. So I roll up the proofs, put them in the tube, push the button, and whoosh! They're gone! But I didn't put them in the cannister, so I broke the damn thing and held up production, and every editor on the floor spent the night screaming at me. But the next day it was like it never happened because there was another edition to get out, and I loved that so much, the turnaround. Can you really type 130 words a minute? I can do it blindfolded. Okay. Well, that's... that's great, but, um... also, Connie, I'm worried you're gonna be overqualified for some of the stuff I have coming in. I don't care. I'm starting over. Whaling used to employ a lot of harpooners, but then the fisheries closed, and the harpooners, I don't know... they came to Temp Joy. I just think you're gonna get a little bored. Boredom is a luxury. I've never been bored in my life. Oh, my God! It's the boy wonder! Who? My old boss. This is good, this is so good... Mark? Hey! It's me! How is that leveraged buy-out treating you? Oh, shit... Aww! Ooooh! I'd like to propose a toast. To Queen Liz, who covered payroll out of her own pocket like some kind of maniac. Thank you. What you did, Liz, taking out that loan... it was insane. Yeah. Greatly appreciated, but insane. You do know that, right? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. But it feels kind of good, you know... I feel focused. Because now I have to find Janet to get my money back or I'm totally and utterly screwed. I have no choice. Lack of choice is freedom. I know! Who knew? God, I wish I could see the world through your eyes, Liz. So are you gonna storm the Omni castle? No. I wouldn't make it past security. So I'm gonna keep it simple. I'm gonna stake out Tarquin and just follow him wherever he goes. He'll lead me to Janet. It's all in the footnotes. You got to read the footnotes. Every single one of them. Yeah. Okay. So maybe we should get some avocados and... "Civitas Solis." Did you read that? Uh, yeah, maybe. It was on the list? Campanella wrote it in prison during the Inquisition. It's about a mythical city to the West protected by a series of circular walls painted with beautiful murals on the inside. Merrill was obsessed with "Civitas Solis." He said it was an actual place if you had the right map. I think he went looking for it. I think it brought him to Long Beach. And he laid the foundation for the new place. Merrill stood right where we're standing. Oh. In the produce section. And once I complete the Magnum Opus and become immortal, like Merrill, I'll be able to enter it. The maps will converge. Uh... Blaise, are you okay? Is he okay? He's... Just relax. You're gonna stay here tonight. Sorry, Ernie. I didn't want to bug you, but Dud thought this would be best. No problem. I'm glad you're here. I didn't know where else to go. It took him forever to get out of the market. They were gonna call the police. I told you, man. This alchemy stuff, it gets in people's heads. But you wouldn't listen. You just encouraged him the whole way. Yeah, but everything we found was... Look where it got you! A freak-out in the produce section. This shit is on you. Ernie, don't say that, okay? Blaise is my friend. I am his apprentice. And I thought we were onto something big. Well, you were wrong. Dud, I don't need any of this right now. Today, I made the dumbest bet of my life. More money than I have. In 24 hours, I'm gonna lose big. I'm more screwed than I've ever been. Well, talk to Burt. I mean, maybe you can get him to cancel the bet. Dud. Just go. I'll take care of Blaise. You... I don't care what you do. Just go. Ernie... Talk to you later, Blaise. Okay. You know I could hear you guys, right? Don't blame Dud. I sort of let things get out of hand. Thanks, Ernie. You want me to tear up Ernie's slip? Yes. Please, just pretend like it never happened. Because if you had any principles at all, you would have never let him make the bet in the first place. Because you know Ernie doesn't have that kind of money. I sit here. People come in. Business is conducted. Services are rendered. Needs are met. And the days go by. Tear it up. It's not on paper. It's all written up here. For eternity. Take it. Liz paid like 8 grand for it. Dr. Kimbrough did. Just take it. Please. Dud. You can't. It's your dad's. Yeah, I know. But he's gone. And I wasn't ready to wear it, anyway. I wasn't ready for Mexico or marriage or anything. Take it. Tell Ernie the bet's off. Reuse, recycle, reimagine. When we take the energy of innovation and combine it with the practice of salvation, you get salivation. Hey! Janet Price! Shut your mouth for a second! I want you all to imagine me as a big planet. Call it "Planet Janet." Yeah, maybe all these people - believe your bullshit, but I don't. - Now climb inside me. Go on. I'm hollow. You're a deadbeat and you owe me money! You can all fit. Yeah, this woman is a complete fraud! - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. - Planet Janet is a place... Hey, you can't disrupt a disrupter, Liz. - It's a sin. - ...where your ideas can be so real they have ideas of their own. Now, I know what you're all thinking, and I don't mean I'm making a guess. I know what you're thinking because they're the thoughts I want you to have. Control the stream of consciousness and you control the narrative, and narrative is workflow. I think it. I make it. I take it. This is a nightmare! - What? - I can't take this anymore! This is worse than Shamroxx! Scott is in a bad place! We tried talking to him, but it's like he's catatonic or something! Scott! Scott... are you okay? I have been released from my duty. And this was the highlight play of the day. Complete defensive breakdown. As Patterson went back to throw, all alone in the end zone was Leonard. He catches it, and right there, 38-37 is the score. Oh, my... God! And now they may drop out of the top 10. Is that a final score? Yeah. It's a huge upset. I just won $20,000! Yeah! Hello, Liz. I hear you're looking for me. I hear you want to punch me in the f... I've never been punched in the face before. I liked it! The taste of reality. I think I broke a finger. I've thought about you often since we jumped off that boat, Liz. - Jesus Christ... - I mean it. You ground me. I'd like you by my side. What would it take for me to hire you as my full-time assistant? Keep in mind, I can pay you a salary that most locals would call totally sick. No, I just want my Higher Steaks crew taken care of. And I want you to pay off my loan. Immediately. I will. I promise. But the violence that passed between us... it was beautiful in a way and pregnant with meaning. It was awful. I still feel nauseous. Listen, Higher Steaks might not be long for this world... So, how about... if I promise to take care of your crew... I give them a big bonus or even a job if they want... would you at least consider the possibility of being my "partner in crime," so to speak? Hey. You got a second? Yeah... come on in. Um... listen, I know that I have messed up a lot of things lately, but... ...I wanted to try and at least make one thing right. So... I've got some really good news. - Yeah? - Yeah. I got some good news, too. - Really? - Yeah. - You go first. - No, no. You go first. Okay, okay. You don't have to worry about that bet anymore. Because today I walked in and I convinced Burt to cancel the bet. Huh? So... you're free and clear, man. How'd you get Burt to cancel the bet? Oh, well, it was easy. I just traded my watch. You traded your dad's watch for me? Yeah. Dud, you can't do that. Um... I don't think you understand. My dad... he was my best friend. And it's like I didn't just lose him. I lost the person that I was when it was Dudley & Son. My life made sense, and then it didn't. And all last year... ...I just felt like I was nobody. Just drifting. I didn't even realize how lonely I was. And the only place I could ever feel like myself... ...is in the lodge. And now that's all gone to shit and you're not there. And I am so scared that I am just gonna drift off again and disappear. And I know my dad's not coming back. So even though you've been kind of a dick lately... ...you're still here, Ernie. And I'd trade the scrolls in a second... ...if I knew I'd never feel lonely again. Your dad raised a good kid. I was a dad once. For a little while. What? You never told me that. My ex, Trish. We met in the Navy. When we got out, we made a whole plan. The house, family... She was born early. You know, complications. Things were never right. And then... I got to hold her for a year. She was my future. After all this time, I can still feel the weight of her in my arms. Her softness. Trish and me, we never recovered. I could have stayed and fought, but... I didn't. I split. Those were some bad years. And then one day... I walked into the lodge. I never talked about her. I... With Larry. Even with Connie. I guess I was waiting for you. What was her name? Her name... was... Amaya. It meant... It... It means... the night rain. Mr. St. John? - Hi. I'm Pamela. - Hey. I read your intake. Um, you want a room? I feel like I need a place to just turn off. My insomnia, it's been a problem my whole life. You understand, we can't give you anything for that. All we do here at Ludibrium is talk. I-I know a few people who have been helped here. Thought I'd give it a try. And the price is right. We're lucky. Ludibrium is able to fund itself. You're helping us as much as we're helping you. Okay. We'll have your room ready soon. Uh, hang here as long as you want. - What are you writing? - Oh. What's that? Just another entry in the canon. Hey, do you have any Benzedrine on you? - Sorry, I don't. - No, it's probably for the best. - I need to slow down. - Yeah, me too. I'm... I'm Blaise. Blaise. I'm Lamar. Welcome to the Garden of Earthly Delights. Holy shit, Blaise. Are you a Lynx? Yes! Wow! The plot thickens. Genevieve, look. Blaise is a member of my fraternal order. Genevieve is French. Which is the most elegant kind of woman. Now, Blaise, let me ask you something... Do you enjoy games of chance? Because I've got Uno. Okay. Let's play. Splendid.
