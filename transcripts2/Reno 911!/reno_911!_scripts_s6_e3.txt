I don't why this would ever come up, But they also said, never, ever, ever Put our new ammunition in your mouth. Ever. Williams: Trudy? My bad. Um... as you know, they're removing all the asbestos Out of the station, Which apparently made up 80% to 85% of the infrastructure. I actually heard the cafeteria trays were made of asbestos. The trays were also made of asbestos. Um, they said, within the next 5, 6 days, It'll all be removed, Uh, we can go back to the station, And meanwhile, we'll be operating out of, uh... Captain Crabby's shrimp wharf here. Everybody get their settlement check? 71 bucks. Whoo! Yeah. Not bad, huh? Not bad. The, uh--The new rape kits are in metric. That's why we can't figure them out.

We are on, uh, special assignment For the state's attorney's office, Uh, picking up convicted serial murderer Calvin Robin Tomlinson. Uh, I guess he cut some kind of deal With the state's attorney's office. Uh, if he shows us where the body of his last victim is buried. I guess he gets a reduced sentence. [Buzzer] Man: prisoners walking! I don't think that's right, I don't, either, but... We want to help the family bury their loved one. So what are you gonna do? Keep both eyes on this psychopath at all times, all right? He's slippery. I certainly will. I'm literally slippery. Don't try to humor me, sir. Don't engage me.

It's not the only way you know how to drink. Do you have to use the potty? Yes. You do? Nnn... not anymore. Did you tinkle yourself? A little bit. Yeah, we're not allowed back in the station For at least, I think, ooh, What is it, like, 6 days While they remove all of the asbestos That apparently made up all the flooring tiles, all of the ceiling tiles. All of the insulation in the walls also was made of asbestos, Which I--Yeah. And for two months after they found the asbestos, They gave us little masks... mm-Hmm. Made of fucking asbestos. We found that out later, that's what they were made out of. So now that we're all good, Does anything around here look familiar? Are we gonna watch "Cold Mountain" At your house or at your house? What? Please? Seriously? You want to watch "Cold Mountain" first? With the director's commentary. After we watch "Cold Mountain" on VHS in my home... Mm-Hmm. You will show us where the body is. And you need to let me deep-throat your pinky. No, sir. Deal's off. Do it. Do it. Williams: aww. No. No. Please? OK. Enough! Now we're gonna watch "Cold Mountain," And then we go to the body, OK? Hit it. Oh! Well... It's better than I remember. It was long. But it's a beautiful movie. It really is. It is beautiful, and she-- Renee Zellweger... I've written her so many letters, And I haven't heard back from her. Just a reminder that Friday is class picture day. So if you can't actually order pictures, Please come and have your picture taken, anyway, So that we knew you existed. Um, so let's now welcome officer Declan and deputy Junior. Uh, before we get started, It's actually sergeant Declan. I worked, uh, pretty hard for that, and, uh... It's just like the same way if someone's a doctor-- You call him doctor, not mister. Oh. I'm very sorry about that. Look. You can go ahead and do it again, quick. Let's please welcome sergeant Declan... To the floor. We'd like to introduce you to another deputy we have: Ms. Ladybug! Everybody say, "good morning, ms. Ladybug." Who here likes to be tickled? I know I do. Yeah. And who here is under 15 years old? See? So is ms. Ladybug. That means that in the state of Nevada, There are places where you can tickle ms. Ladybug... Like right there. That tickles! And then there are places Where you are not supposed to tickle ms. Ladybug. Rape! See? So, when ms. Ladybug asks, You can tickle ms. Lady-- Rape! Oh, come on. Rape! Come on. You saw where I touched her. You saw--That-- You saw where I touched her. Touched her in the head. All right. Sorry. Sorry, kids. I'll hold her down. Rape! Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. [Distorted] rape. Shut up. Shut up. [Distorted] rape. [Beeps] Any question, kids? Well... heh. Remind me to never get raped. How's it going? Hi! We saw your ad, terry. What? Which--Um... I don't-- The one that you put in where it says that You're giving out blow jobs Under the bleachers at the little league field. And ask for terry. Yeah. That one. Yeah. I don't think that that was me. It was--How did they-- How did they spell "terry"? With a capital "t"... OK. "E." "E. Right. "R. Right. "R." "R." Right. "Y." See? Here's the thing. I have... 4 "r"s in my name now. So... Oh, really? Yeah, so it's a different terry. I'm just here watching America's pastime. Hit it! Damn it, we're losing now! You know else is losing? Iraq? OK. One quick pilates lesson, Then you will show us, yes, Calvin? Yes! Fine. 6. 7. 8. And we're breathing. Are you breathing from your core as you do it. Did you fart? Sorry. Screw you, grandpa! If you're supposed to be the greatest generation, How come you smell like Jell-O and pee? Now, give me your social security checks So that I can buy alcohol, play the lottery with it. I need that money for medicine. Fuck you, grandpa! Give me the fucking money, grandpa! I'm gonna abuse the hell out of you till you do! I'll kill you dead! It's a scene that's all too familiar: Senior abuse. Every single day, Hundreds of senior citizens are abused In Washoe county. They're shaken, stabbed, punched, shot, Strangled, and recently, One was tied to the bumper of a van And dragged on a gravel road-- All for their social security checks. Senior abuse is a serious crime, And these social security checks aren't even for that much money. This is one crime that is not worth the time. This has been a message from the Reno sheriff's department. I--I was surprised when he chose to do the remake of "Alfie." I thought that was pretty weird... He's brilliant in everything he does. You think so, really? I love Jude Law so much. I just feel like he's-- But in "Cold Mountain," and he needs to make his way back Through the civil war... yeah. I love our friendship. We're not really friends, Calvin. I would like to be friends. Hey, are you just about done over there, Or what's going on? Oh, I finished 45 minutes ago. Oh, for fucks sake, Calvin. I need a little wipe, though. All right, you damn convict! Don't try any funny stuff! No one's ever broken out of that cell And gotten away with it alive! Strawberry shortcake. Shh. Shh. He thinks he's in a jail cell. But we didn't have enough room today Because they're clearing out for asbestos. It's a whole-- It's a whole long story. Hi, Trude. How do you spell-- Is it "prepetrate" or "perpetrate"? [Whispering] he's a convict. He thinks he's in a jail cell. Ohh. Keep it down in there, convict! Keep it down in there, rodent! I don't want to have to tell you again, Or I'll come in there and toss your salad for you. Opening up cell block number 4, boss! Open up 4! What are you guys doing? He thinks he's in jail. Oh, OK. Keep it down in there, convict! Keep it down! Oh, god! Oh, god! Down here! Down here! My cellmate done hung himself! He done hung himself! Keep it down in there, convict! Keep it down. We ain't falling for that one again. [High-Pitched voice] this is the worst birthday party I ever been to. Lordy, lordy! [Deep voice] look, woman. I'm tired of your nagging and your nattering. If you don't leave me alone, There's gonna be hell to pay! Hell, I tell you! Why don't you just go on back, do your work now And leave me and my boy to our own? We can survive on our own out there. I say we could. We're keeping an entire negro family? Goddamn it, Calvin. All day! Goddamn it, man. We were supposed to have you back 7 hours ago. You'd better be right about this. We'd better find a damn body out here. Oh, I'll be right. You damn well better be right. I'm pretty sure... I don't think that's good to eat. That can't be good to eat. That can't be safe. What are you doing? We're close. We're close. 1, 2, 3. 10 paces. 1, 2, 3. 2. 3. He's fucking with us. Right here... Right here. Is not the spot. Goddamn it!

Who would you call, anyway, Calvin? 1-800-Dark-Twat. [Sigh] Well, I got a health compensation check From the sheriff's department for $71 For working in a asbestos-filled station. And then I spent $87 on seafood this week At captain Crabby's shrimp wharf. So the way I look at it, that's, like, 90% off. Love it. Cha-ching. Calvin? [Grunt] I'm gonna ask you one last time, Are you full of shit? There is nothing here, man. There is fucking nothing here. I might have been off. You might have been off?
