Travis: uh. So all of these evidence tapes--Tapes that we have made At crime scenes, et cetera-- Are on VHS, and the station Has only got one VHS player that still works, and it's Getting harder and harder to find parts, so we're gonna Have to transfer these to DVD. Wow. Yeah, look at that. November 1988. Jesus Christ. I was a rookie. I like the TV from eighties. Is really good. Yeah. Everybody had, like, a monkey and a talking car. And, like, a small, little black boy they lived with. Yeah, there ain't no cute little black boys on TV anymore. Ain't that a shame? I know. Why not? Jones: did you get to November 10 yet? Big Mike on TV: November 2, 1988. We are investigating another homicide. Yeah, back when big Mike was lieutenant. Oh! Hello. Stop looking at my booty. All: ah! Terrible haircut. Terrible. I'm on TV.

That's her. Right. And it's a--It's a binary process. You know, we're both working in tandem to make this Illusion happen, and if the illusion's assistant doesn't Do her job exactly right, then accidents can happen. Maybe--There may be some personal issues at home. Maybe a drinking problem. She's--She's foreign, and, you know-- I'll tell you what. Why don't we wrap this up down at the station, OK? Well, uh, um, that'll be interesting if you're taking Me to the station because I should let you know that The handcuffs have not been made that can contain The amazing Reynaldo! Alakazam!
