 I'm sorry if I'm on edge today. My a capella choir has disbanded. I'm sorry. Aw... That's rough. You and Jeff aren't gonna do it anymore? No. We will never--Me and Jeff will never--We-- Oh, I will never darken his door again. Oh, I'll be assigning shifts. We have to keep an eye on that witness for the state's attorney's office. Uh... Mario... In that case. I don't know if that's-- Is that the code name? Code name's Mario? There's no one in real enforcement But you that uses code names, so I'm assuming that's his real name. OK, his real name is probably Mario, But he's gonna be held up at the--I won't say the name of the hotel. Wiegel: who are you hiding it from? The Shear Arms hotel is where we're gonna be holding that state's witness. What was that? 'Cause it was secret. Wiegel: from who? Declan: well, we heard it. Everybody heard it. You heard it. They heard it, too. I think they heard it. Fine. OK. So they're holding that-- Declan: did you think we were shooting a silent movie? No. I-I got confused. No one has claimed the birdfeeder from the Junior deputies' raffle. I would like to get that off of my books. If you won the fucking birdfeeder, come fucking get it off my desk. I don't want that fucking eyesore on my desk any more. That's what that thing is? That's a birdfeeder? They're the fucking Junior deputies, And they have the slow ones helping this year. No bird would feed from that thing. I agree! I want it off my desk. If you won it, come claim it, or I'm throwing it away. Why don't they raffle off lawn jockeys anymore? I love them lawn jockeys they used to make. Yeah, they got--You know why. They don't raffle 'em off anymore 'Cause they have them working here with us. Ha ha! Oh, I got a million of 'em. Hey, Carmen.

My name is Glen, And it's a pleasure to be here To talk to you about your 401K program. Are you guys excited? We say 401, you say K. 401. All: K. Glen and Chris: 401. All: K. Great job, great job. You guys were in our premiere fund, It's called the international fund, We put all you guys in there, And things were going so great. You guys were making so much money. Here's the bad news. Hold on. I know it's exciting. As you may have read in the newspapers, The economy collapsed all across the world, And the international fund lost a shitload of money. Yes. What is the total value of our 401k's today, right now? If we were taking it in cash. The international fund with everybody from this department invested Was worth over $12 billion with... With everyone around the world that's what it was at the very beginning Right now, it's worth just over $200,000. $200,000. It dipped. It dipped. I don't want to get hung up on how much you lost Because when I looked on your website, It clearly said that you invest with the best possible decision-Making And sometimes it benefits and sometimes you can't predict the future. That's a great question. That's a great question. That's a great question. That's a great point and a great question. Where did the money for our 401k's come from? These are taken out of your paychecks. It's deducted automatically And is put away for your retirement. We've been paying into this. You've been paying into it. You've been paying into this without even knowing it. That's the beauty of it. You didn't even feel it. It's planning for your future without even thinking about it. You didn't even have to think. Thank you. Thank you, thank you for doing that for us. Thank you for letting us not have to make these hard decisions. And you know what? Yeah, we all make mistake. We all have problems? But you know what? I'm not gonna blame you. I'm not gonna blame you. All I'm gonna say is thank you, and I'm gonna say whatever. I'm cool. Thank you, officer Bates. And we'll say it right off the bat--We're sorry. Accepted. There's nothing going on between me and Rizzo. I don't even know why anyone would even have a recommendation To say something so absurd like that. Rizzo and I have nothing going on. Nothing happened in a trailer between the two of us. He did ever--He has never put his fingers inside of me That I can recall. We've never made out. I never confessed my love to him, And he has never, ever, ever come in me from behind. That's absurd. That's absurd. Uh. It seems specific, I know you're thinking. And it is. I have a very photographic brain, A lot like Ansel Adams But in color and with a lot more insertion and pubic hair. So you and Rizzo did it? We fucked in the trailer, yeah. Oh, hi, Sara. Ha ha! Bates: Glen, 'cause I had to tell 'em. Pat 'em down. OK. Pat 'em down. I had to tell them. It's very convenient. Jail is very, very close. Very, very, very close. Get 'em out of here. Take off all their clothes. Take off all their clothes. It's a little prank. We'll hose 'em off. We'll strip 'em naked, And we'll leave 'em in sparks. We'll leave 'em in sparks. We'll leave 'em in sparks. Ready? Strip 'em, hose 'em. Â♪ OK, strip 'em and hose 'em and take 'em to sparks â♪ Â♪ strip 'em and hose 'em and take 'em to sparks â♪ Â♪ strip 'em and hose 'em and take 'em to sparks â♪ Â♪ well, strip 'em and hose 'em and take 'em to sparks â♪
