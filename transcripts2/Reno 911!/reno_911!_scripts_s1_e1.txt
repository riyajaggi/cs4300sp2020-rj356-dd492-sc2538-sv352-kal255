Something about you behind that counter Seems to just set men on fire. Seems like they just... You're rape bait, keith. Those two guys-- One of them said that. Called you rape bait ? I hate to agree with them, but I kind of do. You're doing something right here. Keith, you get rape rookies in here. You know how odd that is ? You know how rare that is ? In a weird way, man-- hey, badge of honor. People who never, ever raped a clerk Say, "I'm gonna break it in on keith." I got to balance my register. I never really worked one of these things before.

( laughing ) If we gave these brownies out to everybody, right... ( laughter ) Pretty good. Whoo ! ( siren ) All right, well, at this point, We were supposed to watch a driver-safety film Entitled "blood on the highway" By the department of transportation safety board, But you all have been pretty good, So I brought in another film About highway safety and law enforcement, ( in falsetto ) a little picture called... â™ª smokey and the bandit â™ª No talking during smokey and the bandit If you talk, that will be one point on your driver's license, And there will be a test. Reno, this is 14-david-21. We are on the scene. ( tires screeching ) Sheriff's department ! You call 911 ? Yes, I did. What's the problem, sir ? I think you're gonna be very pleased with me When I tell you what it is. Oh, hello. I have compiled a list of 500-- I got 500 cars that have run the stop sign right here. Don't bother to thank me, I've got it right here. You've made a citizen's arrest Or just a citizen's list ? It's a citizen's list Which I hope to become an arrest with your help. I got some here that are very interesting. Most of the plates are nevada, Which, I think, because we're in nevada. Adds up. It makes sense. I got-- we don't have indiana. Look at this-- I got here this one-- A black-and-white police car ran that light. I got the license here- 83752. It's rhode island. Yeah, we're allowed to do that. That's us. Oh, that's you ? This is an ambulance ran the light here. Okay, they get to do that, too. They can ? Oh, yeah. Anything that goes, "whoo-whoo-whoo." Now, let me ask you this: If you guys drive your own cars when you're off duty And you go through that light, can you arrest yourself, then ? Oh, hell, I got to take this, yeah ? What's it say there on the invisible radio ? Uh-huh. We should really get to that, don't you think ? Uh-oh, uh-oh ! My wonder woman radio was going off, so we should probably-- Why don't we take this ? And we will put it in the file. Oh, okay. Well, do you need my name or social security number ? We know it. Do you have a private extension, if I call again ? Yes, we do. It's 1-800-eat-shit 1-800-8-10. No. But that's not enough numbers. Major bummer, jeff. I didn't study for my geometry final today. I'm, like, totally gonna fail. Take a chill pill, susie. Watch and learn. ( dialing ) 9-1-1, I'd like to report a bomb threat. ( gasps ) Thanks, jeff, you're da bomb. Time out, jeff. Stop, drop, and think. Every fake bomb threat you call in Keeps us from stopping the hundreds of... Real bombs Set to blow up in reno all the time, every day. Gee, deputy, I didn't think of that. One thing I've learned... Bomb threats aren't da bomb. That's right. And this is deputy williams keeping it real-- Real safe. All right, 28... What was the bandit's license-plate number ? And it ain't "bandit." A lot of people get it wrong. A lot of people think it's "bandit." It ain't "bandit." All right, final question here-- What color were sally field's shorts ? Can you make that noise doing this ? It takes me a while. Hold on, let me pull over. Oh, we're in a school zone. That's okay. ( squeaking ) ( sniffing ) It doesn't smell when you do that. I know, that's weird. Does yours ? Gosh, you're better-- no. ( chuckling ) no, it doesn't. Mine smells a little like cheetos. Oh... Yeah, I smell that. I smell that. That's 'cause I just farted. ( loud rock music plays, young man screaming ) Oh, sweet lord almighty. Hey, do you think-- do you think this is where... They don't even notice us. Hey, ho, ho, ho ! Stinky, stinky, stinky. Holy tamole ! Guess why we're here. Uh, we were, uh, we were-- Because you can hear your crappy band six miles away, And just constructive criticism-- You sound awful. You really, really sound bad. Really bad. My god... That's real nice. Is this yours ? We borrowed that one. ( playing bluesy riff ) Hey, joe, you, uh, you play the drums a little bit, don't you ? Yeah, I love to play drums. ( both playing ) Clemmy, we're going to need some backup. Anyway, I'm hoping That you will break your celibacy for me. Oooh, careful ! I'm want to send in some white light. You know, bring in the white light Into the energy field. I was only doing it, like, To protest the war and stuff, I sorta of feel that. I think the troops are moving out anyway. Hey, buddy, do you mind, um-- Sorry, excuse me. That's okay. We'll just wait here. Let me talk to him real quick. Yeah, peace. ( chuckles ) Take your time. Hey, dude. ( chuckles ) Whoo, it feels good. Yeah ! What have we been doing all our lives ? Nothing, man. Risking our necks for... What ? I haven't had a beautiful woman touch me in 15 years, man. I'm done. Let's call it. This is it, let's quit. You're buddy, I'm kyle. All right, kyle. ( both chuckle ) Oh, shit. What ? That's him, man. That's one-eyed jack. Hey, freeze ! Freeze-- sheriff's department !
