The pope wears a hat. I have a crown. Funny how it worked out. I would like to see your pope, Your "pope," heh heh, come and turn a slurpee into wine. He does not possess such abilities. Could he turn root beer into beer? We almost lose him, like, 10 times a day. It's a possession! It's a possession! It's not a possession. It's not--There's no--You're joking. Look. Oh, my god!

Sometimes, they get caught under your wheels. OK. Get down. This is where you get shot at. Every time you go through here, you get shot. No! Get down, get down! So, uh, this is Carmen. She calls a couple a times a week. Hi, Carmen. Carmen: hi, butter. What you doing there? I'm building a wall to keep terrorists out of my venue. Look. Did you have a problem with terrorists? Well... yes. They were gonna try to get in their truck, And I was like, "huh? Those guys look evil," And so I was like, "hey." I was trying to make, like, a decoy, And so I was like, "hey. If you guys Want to come and hang out in my place." That's hard to resist. Yeah. So they--So they come in. Of course because I've been brewing my own soda lately, And, like--So I was like, "Hey. You can have some of my soda," you know, And then--And then, this is kind of what sealed the deal. Sounds like this is where the big thing happened. The climax. The climax. The climax is they were like, "Do you have any hand sanitizer?" And that was a threat? I said, "do they allow hand sanitizer on planes? Not anymore. No. No, they don't." Up to four ounces, they sure do. You know what? Ultimately, they were like, "Can we have some hand sanitizer?" And I was like, "hold on. I'll be right back," And I did it kind of slow motion like that, And then I gave you guys a call, And then when I came out, they were gone. Can I tell you something? You did a good job here today Because you didn't let them walk away with the sanitizer. I think we're gonna be OK here. Maybe next time you guys come, I could get, like, a certificate or something. We could probably pull that off. Maybe, maybe. Sure. Maybe, like, a key to the town. No, not that, but we'll get you a certificate. We'll get you a piece of paper. Well, we'll start small, yeah. OK.

Do you have sex? I have taken a vow of celibacy, so, no. So if I offered to jerk off your penis right now, You would say what, "no, thank you"? I would have to say, "no, thank you, please. Please do not-- Please do not jack off"-- Jack off? Please--Don't-- Please don't give me those eyes. I've taken down stronger men than you with these eyes. I'd like to ask you a religious question... Oh, please, please. Because this comes up around our house a lot. Yes. Uh, is it a sin to fuck a monkey? Because they're, like, one chromosome away, And they're, like-- You look in their eyes, And they're almost human. A monkey is an animal. Human was created by god--Adam and Eve. Short answer-- Sin to fuck a monkey? Yes. Do not have sex with any animal. Even a monkey? A monkey is an animal. We do not have sex with a monkey, A dog, an elephant. You do not. I don't have a pen. This has been a public service announcement. Had this been an actual emergency, You would have been notified After the tone about emergency evacuation. Stop! Parate. That was horrible. That was horr-i-ble. Do it again but less gay. Less gay? Yo soy a mariposa. I'm gay. I like to be with men A-Deepy, doopy, doopy, doopy, may. [Deep voice] this has been a test Of the emergency broadcast system. Oh, wait. Did we bring James Earl Jones in To do this? No, we didn't. We brought a puto cabron named Junior. Mira como ella does it. Look how she does it. Haga lo bien sexy. Sexier, sexier? Sexier. [Slowly] this has been a test-- When you think about something exciting, What makes you excited downstairs? Law enforcement. OK. He's definitely gay. Hey. We're here at John McKay high school Just doing routine metal detector check To see if any of the students have weapons, And so far, you get an "a," America. I get so sick and tired of the media Exaggerating things and trying to have us live In a culture of fear. Right. Because you know what? The kids aren't that bad. They really aren't. They really aren't. It's just that the media goes crazy because you know what? It's not the news. It's the bad news. Yes. Bingo! Good kid. Good guy. You know what that was? That was 12 good kids Just walked through these gates. Mm-Hmm. The cities and schools of Reno--Safe. Heh heh. What's up? Metal detector's unplugged. Goddamn metal detector's unplugged. [Alarm beeping] Whoa! Hey, girl. Get back here. Hey. OK. That's--OK. Trudy on radio: we have a shooter in the library Of John McKay high school. Dispatcher: all units, all units, Shots fired in the cafeteria Of John McKay high school. I think we're on it. I'm gonna take the library. OK. Oh. Declan, I'll beep if I go-- Oh. I can just. Jack: sweet Jesus, we're under siege! Get down! The library's full of guns! Dangle: so Trudy's late husband, as we all remember, Was the Truckee river killer, And he was executed by lethal injection By the state of Nevada, But he did make a whole bunch of videotapes In prison before they juiced him up, And we're just going through them To make sure there aren't any clues To maybe where there's other bodies Or anything like that. Hey, unborn son. It's your dad Craig again. I thought you'd probably need to have a talk About the birds and the bees, And it's a tough talk, so let's just make this painless as possible. What you want to do is take these things And put it on this thing Before you do anything, OK? And to do this... You just put it-- Hold on a second. You just-- OK. That's not how you do that. No. He never wore condoms. He said that he always felt like he wanted To feel skin on skin or teeth on skin. Sure. I hope this was instructional And you learned something. So good luck and be safe. Sorry, T-Bone. No. I said I was sorry, OK? I just-- Could he perform the love act on you Other than that one time that made the baby? He used to want me to crawl underneath the bed And keep calling out, "please don't come and get me. Please don't come and get me," While he would pleasure himself up on top of the bed. So he would--You all would reenact A crime investigation role-Play. No. Why do you have to make it sick and dark like that? No. It's just a young lady hiding under the bed, Screaming, "don't come get me," With an adult serial killer Jacking off his manhood on the bed. Thank you. That's not that weird. Dangle: well, uh, wonderfulness, We hope that you have enjoyed everything That our little city has to offer you, And I think I speak for all of us And the community in general when I say, You my nigger, you my nigger. Most places that we visit show us only their beauty, Take us only to the neighborhoods of the rich. You opened up and showed us your honesty, A place so yearning, so much in need of some godliness. You showed me a place that is in desperate need for some holiness. So the pope is coming? The pope would come here? Ha ha ha! That--They think maybe the pope would come here? Ha ha ha! [Spits] Sorry. No. That is a ridiculous notion That the pope would come here. Fuck you for thinking that. Nice! Nice! Nice. Hey. Let's all fla--Let's flash The chopper as it goes. Jones: front flash? Trudy: oh. With vag? Dangle: yeah. Good thing I got sunblock on my dick already. Jack: suck it! Suck it! Franky: screw you! Junior: you have sunblock on your dick? Dangle: oh, yeah. You never know. Jones: ha ha! That's my prince Albert. You see that? It's shining. Dangle: what? Trudy: wait. People are jerking off? No, no. Hey. Timeout. Timeout. What? Oh. Timeout. I did not-- No, no. I did not-- I thought that was what we were doing. No! I said, "let's flash them." I didn't--I never. Oh, come on. Who finished? Whoa. Gee. How fa--We were doing that for 30 seconds. Pick up your prince Albert. Good lord. Trudy: god. I don't even want to go to fuddruckers. Now we're not going to fuddruckers. We are not going to fuddruckers. You never said-- That's rid--Come on. Williams: come on.
