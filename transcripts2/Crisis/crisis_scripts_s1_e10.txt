 Previously on Crisis... You should see this, sir. Every news outlet has it. That's the video from the CIA. - Yes. - I'm coming for you. Say good-bye to everything you love while you can. - What do you want from me? - To destroy Widener. Don't let me sleep. I dreamed of those people. The ones you killed in training? The ones they're sending me to kill next. I need your wife. I need a spy. I will save our son.

 You're asking me to kill my son. What happened? This is too soon. Mrs. Liao is the only one who could've stopped that virus. She failed. The most important parent mission is still to come. That parent must know the price of failure. Please don't. They made me do it. 1x10 - Found We don't know it's him. It's him. You're the FBI? - Special Agent Dunn. - Finley. Secret Service. Okay. It's, uh... ...he's this way.

 Homeowner came out because someone left the lights on. Found this. - We're gonna need the room, deputy. - Of course. We did this. We killed this boy. We stopped his mother from doing what she was supposed to do, and we killed him. And how many people would have died if we hadn't? Dunn, look at me. Gibson killed him. You remember that. When we catch him and you look at him, you remember it was him who did this. He put this boy here. Okay, let's work the scene. The victim is male, approximately age 16. Single entrance wound, mid-back, close range. No other signs of trauma. Appears to be Jin Liao, a Ballard School hostage. Let's turn him over. Single exit wound. A handwritten note attached with the words, "My Mother Failed." Gibson will want the other parents to see this. So they know what happens to their children if they don't do as he asks. Gibson wanted Mrs. Liao to stop our search for 12 hours. - And she only gave him six. - What's Gibson need six hours for so badly that this kid had to die? The chemical process is the chemical process. I can't make it go faster. If you want me to make this compound, I need more time. - The FBI and the National Guard? - At our door in four hours, tops. They are closing in on us. Why are we still here? Why are we still here, Francis? They have a ring around this area five miles out, and it's closing fast. We need to get out of here. No. You need to go back to your lab and - finish your work. - What difference does it make if I finish it? We need to get the compound into Hawkins. He's out there, we're here, and there are 10,000 armed men between us. Do you want to be free, Jonas? - Yes. - Of everything you've done? - Yes. - Do you want to destroy Widener? Yes. But they will find us. - I know. - They're gonna take this place by force, and kill us all. Let me deal with that. Just go back in the lab and finish your work. - Open a secure line. - I can't guarantee it's secure. The Feds are focusing everything they have on this area. It's like an electronic blizzard out there. Nothing is secure anymore. I just needed a little more time. And then I would have finished this and that child would still be alive. Why would his mother not do everything possible to protect her child? Open a line. Hello? Yeah, yeah, he's here. Hang on a second. Buddy, it's for you. - Who is it? - Some woman. Hello. Do you miss your son? Who the hell is this? Had you given up hope? You have no idea who you're messing with here. I know exactly who I'm messing with. I know where you spent those lost 14 years. If you know I did time in Leavenworth, then you know what put me there. Lots of blood put you there. Then you know you should stop talking about my family, hang up the phone, and stay out of my life. I know that you gave your son your name and that you call him Junior. I'll find you and gut you. I know you say to yourself every day that you'll do anything just to see him again. You can't know that. But it's true, isn't it? Yes. Well, Buddy, here's your chance. What would you do to see your son again? Anything. sync & correction by f1nc0 ~ Addic7ed.com ~  Please, you don't have to do this. They made me do it. Ian? Ian, what's the matter? Come with me. - What's going on? - Shh. Not yet. I think they listen to us. And I need to tell you something and they can't hear it. You know how they take your dad back there? - Y-Yeah. - I found a hole in the wall. - And I could see in. - Ian, you're scaring me. They made him do something. What did they make him do? Jin Liao didn't get out, Beth Ann. Well, then where is he? He's dead. What are you talking about? Ian, what did you see? I saw your father shoot Jin Liao. No. No. No, no, no, no, that couldn't have happened. No, you're lying. You're lying. No. No. They made him do it. He didn't want to. Oh, my God. Who are these people? Why would they make him do that? - Why? - I've known your dad my whole life. This wasn't him. It was them. They made him do it. You have to remember that. You can't tell anyone. You can't tell anyone. No one can know, because they won't understand. - They won't understand. - Okay, okay, okay. - Where are the authorities? - Three miles out and closing. - You have your gear ready? - Yes. Hold out your hand. Hold out your hand. Good. Steady. Now tell me your name and what unit you're with. The kidnapper wanted us to find this boy's body. The light was left on so the homeowner would come out and check. Now, the sign tells us that he'll still be using the parents. It's important to him that they know that unless they do what he tells them to do, their children will die. Like the CIA massacre video, we can only assume that he'll be releasing this online as well. The location where they left him? Why there? That's the only piece of good news. It's within the search perimeter established by the FBI and National Guard. We don't think he can get out any further than this. He's trapped. And we're closing in. We believe this is the first time he's killed. He's been methodical from the start, but we can expect his methods to become more extreme. We got 'em. What we believe was, one of the kidnapper's calls originated from within the search grid 43 minutes ago. We did not get content or an exact origin where the call came from. - What did you get? - I can give you the phone number - and exact address where the call went to. - Go. You two take point on this. - Take what you need and hit it hard. - Yes, sir. Lots of activity emanating from the Capitol, with hundreds... perhaps thousands... of FBI and National Guard continuing their search for the Ballard hostages. In breaking news, another horrific image released on the internet. What appears to be the dead body of a Ballard student posted anonymously in what must be a heartbreaking sight for his parents and all of us who wished for these students' safe return. This makes the second gruesome news release in two days. With video of what appears to be United States Special Forces operatives engaged in the massacre of American women and children. Voices on Capitol Hill are calling for CIA Director Widener to answer questions as to what this video has to do with the Ballard kidnapping. I'd be happy to answer any questions the Senate committee has. The CIA has one mission... to protect this country and its values. FBI! Get on the ground! Get down! - FBI! FBI! - Move fast! - Get down! - Get down! FBI! Gonna need to see a warrant. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. That phone rang 90 minutes ago. All we want to know is who took that call. This phone's been quiet all day. You're in the wrong place. - Everyone got a target? - Yes, sir. - All head shots? - Yes, sir. I know these guys just train and train and train. How about you? Put 'em down. - Put 'em down. - Guns on the ground! The weapons have been confiscated. All clear. No calls. That's funny, 'cause we know a call came in here. - Must be a mistake. - Don't think so. Anybody hear the phone ringing here today? No? Didn't hear anything? Didn't see anything? Did you see the news about a boy found out in Maryland? That dead yellow kid? What the hell do we care about that? What the hell did you do to get one of them as your partner? Dunn... Just have been something real bad. Hey! Give me that back. Hey! - Don'tmove! - You got no right. - That's not yours, man. - It is now. "You've all been brothers to me, family, and since my son's been taken, you're the only ones who've been there for me. I was offered a chance to see my son again, so I'm going to take it. I know I was never a good dad. Maybe I can do this. Keep up the good fight. Buddy." - Who is Buddy? - I am. No. You're Skip. Now, why don't you tell me Buddy's last name? Yeah, it's, um... it's Buddy Screw-you. Agent Dunn? Think you should see this. Plastic explosive. Yeah, where's the other half of that brick? How long before the FBI gets here? At this rate... 90 minutes. - 90 minutes... - They won't come in. They'll set up a perimeter and begin negotiations. And will you negotiate? Or are we going to die here? No one's going to die here, Jonas. There was blood on these floors. Bullet holes in the walls. They sent our soldiers in to kill me. Our own soldiers. Thayer made it in and took out five before we stopped him. Hawkins killed one of my men. And he remembered his training, and he returned to a secure location. I got deep enough into Widener's computer to know that, but I need you now. You think I know where that is? Widener would have established all new locations as soon as he discovered that I wanted to blow the whistle on him, - move them every few days. - I know that. New locations, but the people working there are the same. People you've trained. - Who would be taking care of Hawkins now? - My lab assistant, Ben Auster. Write down his cell phone number. I know they threatened your daughter's life, Francis. But you know I had nothing to do with that. Auster, you got to do something about him. - I just checked on him. - Then check on him again. There you are. - I'm real sick. - I know. - I need the stuff. - I don't have it. - I can give you something to sleep. - No. No sleep. I don't want to dream. We are able to confirm now that the image released earlier today online is, in fact, the body of Jin Liao, a Ballard hostage found dead - in the Maryland countryside... - With this going on, it's hard to believe the Senate wants to have hearings on the CIA. As my lawyer, I'd have thought you'd have figured out that it is because this is going on that the Senate wants to have hearings on the CIA. They want to know what the kidnapping has to do with the CIA, and now what this dead boy has to do with CIA. They want to talk to General Osborne, but he killed himself. They want to talk to Jonas Clarenbach, but he's missing. And since your company is a CIA contractor, and you have a kidnapped child, they can't wait to call you. I got my hands on a partial list of questions you'll be asked. Where did you get this? - Don't ask. - "How would you characterize Porter Pearce's relationship with the CIA?" "What programs, unclassified and classified, is your company involved with?" "Do you know of any connection between your company, the CIA and the Ballard kidnapping?" To all of which you will invoke your Fifth Amendment right. "What is your knowledge of the American soldiers found inside the Pakistani Embassy?" "What is your knowledge of the massacre video released on the Internet? Have you had conversations with CIA Director Widener concerning this video?" - Invoke the Fifth. - "How would you characterize your relationship with your ex-employee, Dr. Jonas Clarenbach?" - The Fifth. - "Exactly what CIA "program did Dr. Clarenbach work on? Do you know the whereabouts of Dr. Clarenbach?" Invoke the Fifth. These questions at the bottom seem a bit off-topic. The Senate has you up, Meg, they're going to ask. "This committee has information your daughter Amber was a closed adoption. Do you know the identity of Amber's parents?" And if so, have you given this information to the FBI?" That bar you're in is run by Aryans United. And Aryans United is a full-on anti-government hate group. Lots of violence, lots of time in prison. We're coordinating with gang task force to run down their roster. - Any CIA connection? - No. And no connection to Ballard. We'll use the scan you sent to match handwriting, but every Ballard parent is accounted for, and none of the Ballard fathers is nicknamed Buddy. Whoever he is, he's a dad, and he's out there with half a brick of plastic explosive. Agent Finley? Meg. - He killed a kid. - I know. He just left that boy there. Just dumped him, Susie. - His parents, to see that... - I know. I guess I always thought Gibson is a father, and he'd never go through with it. Susie, I don't think I'm going to see Amber again. - It's all clear! - All clear! We're all clear! I have no idea how my truck ended up out there. - Stolen, I guess. - Why don't you tell me who Buddy is? Don't know anybody named Buddy. You understand I am the Director of the FBI. You know what's going on out there, so you need to believe that I can put you in a hole, and then I can forget where that hole is, so tell me what Buddy has to do with those Ballard kids. Look at me. Do I look like I got anything to do with that school? The other side of that roadblock is inside our search grid. Why does Gibson send a parent through there? Gibson's bringing this guy to him. If Buddy's on foot, then he's close. We need to tell our choppers to center their search here. - It's done. - Wait. Shh. Listen. - What? - They're here. I'll be wanting the last four digits of that bank account. - Now. - 8-3-7-1. - $25 million. - You're mad. The two of you. To think you'll be able to spend that money. You hear what's above our head? Nothing's getting out of here. Not that. And not us. They'll back off soon, Jonas. They will back off... and will give us a phone number to call. - To negotiate. - Yes, to negotiate. They will ask us if there's anything they can do for us. They will want to be our friends. They will want to talk. I'm scared. Why aren't you scared, Francis? I am. I'm terrified. Francis, that's 20 doses you just loaded into there. I know. I'm going to need them all. I see them. Get away from the window. Get away from the window. - Where's my father? - Get down! Get down! - Where's my father? - Get down. Quiet. Shut up. Just shut up. Putting you on speaker, Red Duke One. Play that for the room. Copy that. This is 30 seconds ago picked up on our interceptor microphone. Get away from the window. Get away from the window. Keep rolling, Red Duke One. I'm filtering for your rotors. Where's my father? Where's my father? I want analysis on those voices. - What? - No. What are you doing? Where are we going? I want the satellite looking down on those choppers right now. Onscreen... now. Red Duke One, I need your GPS again. We seem to be in error here. Red Duke One, what are you seeing? We're over what appears to be an abandoned military base, but I'm not reading it on the map. I need your live image now. Coming to you now. We are live. You are looking at what appears to be the base commander's house. North end of an airfield. I want to look into those windows. Angling for that now, sir. - The rest of you in here. - You heard him, move! Move! We found them. Director Olsen... the satellite? - What about it? - The feed was rerouted. That sat takes an optical picture, but the feed back to Earth is digital. It was rerouted. This is the true image of those GPS coordinates. Back those choppers off. Establish a perimeter. Set up an Incident Command Center in one of those hangars. Get me a chopper. I'm going out there. Get me Finley and Dunn. And get me the president. Now. Move. You might want to leave the room for a moment. Why? What's about to happen? Too late. I have money. My dad does. Lots of it. He's a crook. Tons of money. When you get out of here... I'm getting out? Thank you. Thank you so freaking much. Thank you. When you get out here, you will feel very sick. Nothing they do will help. Sick. Why... Why would I be sick? But if you hold on, if you fight, you will come through. What's happening? Why will I be sick? What are you gonna do? He'll be out for about two minutes. Hey, Francis, what are you doing? You know one massive injection won't work. - It needs to be built up. - Oh, I know that. Stop saying my name and let go of my arm. If you know that, then w ... You're gonna use this boy to mule out the compound. You're gonna smuggle it in his blood. That's why you need him so much. You're either with me, or you're dead. Massive amount of manpower and material flowing into the small area in the Maryland countryside. And while there is an FBI official news blackout, the indication is clear. There has been a big break in the Ballard hostage crisis. Yes? - Hello? - You watching this? Yes. Is it true? - Is it them? - Looks like it. Listen, I know this has been bad... for your sister, for your daughter, for you. - I don't think you do. - Meg, you took a physical beating. Even trained professionals break more than bones. But this is coming to an end, it's gonna be over soon, we need to think about what's going to happen next. I thought that was you going to jail. You need to listen to your lawyer's advice, Meg. Take the Fifth. We can help each other or we can hurt each other. ___ - You've already helped me. - And how have I done that? You tracked how Gibson made money when the worldwide market crashed. You hacked into my computers? When I gave you the name of the kidnapper, I was curious to see what you were going to do. I know you're smarter than me, Meg. Why wouldn't I just watch you to see what you were doing? You found Gibson's money. - I found it, yes, but... - But you didn't take it. Why? Because there's a dead boy in the news. Because every attempt we make, he beats us. I got a list of reasons, but that isn't one of them. Because he doesn't have your child. I just want my daughter back. Of course. You're her mother. But what happens when she comes home? What do you want then, Meg? I want my daughter back, Gabe. I've lost my taste for beatings. ___ Move out. If you're Gibson and you know you're trapped, where do you send your parent where you know he can do the most damage today? I send him right here. He's had our playbook from the start, no reason to think he's not still using it. The satellite feed was rerouted. Choppers and drones did flyovers but then called it in to local PD to check out on foot. Those calls were rerouted and marked all clear. And because the floor plans were not public record, the released hostages' descriptions didn't match any computer searches. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. About to establish communication. Hostage negotiation team is here, but you two are point on this. You're the Gibson experts. - Understood. - And our mystery parent? We're tracking him from his abandoned pickup truck just outside the search perimeter, but we think he's headed here, sir. The bomb dogs are here already. That plastic explosive is not getting in. - No ID on him? - No, sir, we're looking for a white male, nickname Buddy. Get with security and have them run every man here through that filter and then report back to me. - It's time we started making the calls. - Yes, sir. Kyle. I'm sick. - I'm real sick. - Hang in there. This is the FBI.  We are here in force. We want to talk with the person in charge.  We have an open line for you to call. We're here. We want to help. - Everything ready? - Yes, sir. Okay. Here we go. Don't call him Gibson. Let him think he still has total control. Quiet. Quiet! Put it on the loudspeakers. This is FBI Director William Olsen. Who do I have on the line with me? Good afternoon, Director Olsen. First, let's start with the ground rules. One... nobody approaches us. This is for everyone's own good. The house is rigged to explode. Any trespass results in detonation. - This is Assault 3 in position. - Assault 3, go ahead. We have no visual targets, but we do have laser trip wires. Copy that. Maintain in the position. - Lots of them. - Copy that. Assault 3 , hold no fire. They were ready for us. Two... choppers and drones out of our airspace. We'll send you images from in here. You get to see more than you want to. I can do those things for you. What will you do for me in return? - We have a very sick child here. - Who? Is one more important than another? I'm sorry. That's not fair. We all have our own priorities. Ours is to get this sick child medical attention. Clear our airspace, and he's yours. - We'll come and get him. - No. That's okay. We'll send him out. Let's go. Get up! I have one hostage and two targets. Am I green? Do I shoot? Negative. No shot. No shot. Trip wires will be disabled as the boy walks through them. You may get him when we say so. All other movement results in detonation. Can you tell us what's wrong with him? It would help. He suddenly became extremely ill. Go close on him. Quarantine a section of the medical tent. - Is CDC here? - On their way. - Half an hour out. - Everyone near that boy - is in a full suit until CDC clears him. - Bioweapon? I'm not taking anything Gibson gives us as a gift. Go find out what happened to that kid. You can have him now. Hey, how you doing? It's okay. We're here to help you. He said you'd say that. But you can't... you can't help me. Gibson is playing us, and he's using this boy right here to do it. We need to find that parent. - Dutton. Where the hell you been? - On vacation. Took me a week to get back here. Where do they have me? Communications over there. - What's with the two lines? - Just making sure everyone who's here is supposed to be here. This is SWAT secure 2819. I am on online and request radio check of all units. Tactical first. Begin. - How did you get her in there? - She's one of them. She's a cop. Dunn. Go ahead. Partial print match on the note. Delman Birch, Marine. Vietnam. No connection to Ballard or any kid at Ballard. No connection to Gibson or CIA. Yeah. He's got one kid. They're looking for him now. Thank you. They're sending through his file. How did we miss another parent Gibson could use? Delman Birch. That name sound familiar to you? Yeah. Where have we heard it? Here it is. Finley, right there. There's a pass waiting here for me. - How's the boy? - Sick. Why don't you help us so we can help him? You pump our children full of lies. Then accuse us of making them sick. You care for these children? But you're putting them in harm's way. - We do care for them. - Then show us. Okay. But this goes both ways. - Blue shirt right here. - What? You can have five kids right now. You have that power right now. Hey, I didn't do anything. I swear. We only need one thing from you. Secret Service Agent Marcus Finley. In here. Now. No other communication until that happens. I'm ready to go back in. I'm done here. - He might kill him. - I don't think so. - Gibson doesn't kill for no reason. - Jin Liao? For Gibson, there was a reason. His mother failed. Finley has been a thorn in his side since day one, but if he'd wanted him dead, he'd have done it by now. The kids are Gibson's power. If he's giving five of them up, it has to be for a bigger reason than just killing Finley. Well, I'd like to know what that reason is before we send him in there. I'd like to know what that reason is so we don't get played. Why? Why do you need to know? It gets us five kids. That's the reason. You don't want to know why he's asking for you? I'll figure that out when I'm in there and those kids are out here. Just like that? Just like that. - Beth Ann, I tried. - I know. I know. - They're too strong. - I know. - I tried to keep you safe. - I know. I know what you did. I know you did it just to keep me safe. You know? What do...? What do you know? Ian saw, Dad. - What happened with Jin Liao. - Oh... But it's okay, 'cause we're gonna get out of here, and no one is ever, ever, ever going to know about it. I can keep you safe, too. You find out what Buddy was doing - and what's wrong with Luke. - Yeah, I got it, Finley. He's not done in here. - He knew we were coming. - I got it. Look, Dunn, I want you to know something. You're a good partner. Yeah, I mean, at least I didn't shoot you, right? - No, you didn't. - Agent Finley, sir? We've got a Humvee waiting to take you up there. It's about a thousand yards across the runway, and then you'll walk it in. - Who's here from transport? - That'd be me. He's here. sync & correction by f1nc0 ~ Addic7ed.com ~
