 Previously on Crisis I arranged to be the chaperone on this school trip and they're counting on me. You get on the bus, you don't talk to me, you don't look at me! We know who you are. We talked to the agents in that other SUV. Movement! Agent Finley here is the only person who has seen the faces of the kidnappers, the only person who has heard their actual voices. So he's with you. With you as our only lead

 on a day when the US President's son has been kidnapped. As you can tell from the way you were taken, we are professionals. We are also very comfortable with the use of force. Tell me what you see. Two men, mid-20s, both unconscious. Hold on that one. I know him. He was our liaison. We had a problem with operation Lennox. They're dead, Francis. Who's dead? Men... women...

 Children... most of our guys. It just got out of hand. That massacre video you need... It's locked inside a CIA vault. How you planning on getting it out? You have to ask yourself right now: "How far are you willing to go?" What will you do for your child? - Congressman Wirth, I need that phone! - Not yet. Do I get my kid back now? When can I see my mom? They're still questioning her, but the important thing is that she's okay. Agent Finley here saved her life. If my mom's in jail, will they let her out to go to my dad's funeral? I'm sure they will. We're almost done here, Sharlene. You're doing great. Everything you're giving us is going into the system for processing. I know this is hard... ...but every detail is going to help us identify and locate the kidnappers... And free your friends. We just wanted to ask you about Mr. Gibson. What "about Mr. Gibson?" Did you ever see him interact with any of the guards? Yeah. The first time was when he tried to get us rescued and... They caught him and punished him. Punished him how? They cut off his finger. Right in front of us. You said that was the first time. What happened the second time? They took Mr. Gibson away. They said to question him about where he used to work. Beth Ann said it was the CIA. Janice Gibson? Listen careful if you want to see your family again. Please... How did this...? You've been in my house. You need to focus, Janice. We know that CIA director Widener is a close friend. He isn't my friend, he was just my husband's old boss. That's a lie. He is godfather To Beth Ann. He cares for you. Tell him you need him and he will come. How do you know me? I know everything... About all of you. Get Widener to your house. What will you do to him? He trusts you, Janice. To save your daughter's life, You will poison him. - Synced and corrected by Retrojex - - www.addic7ed.com - Meg... What are you doing here? Sharlene is Amber's best friend. She's going to be staying with us until your people let her mother go. I know that you're alone and you won't talk to me about it. You should tell your partner, she is your daughter. Dunn? Your sister... You don't trust her, do you? No, I don't. That's why her FBI handlers are staying close. Can I ask why you don't trust her? No. She do something to you? "No," as in my personal life has nothing to do with this investigation. Your life includes your sister and your niece. So maybe it does. It doesn't. Are we through with this? She must've done a real job on you for you to shut her down like that when her daughter's out there. We are done with this. Okay. We are done with this. CIA director is here. What do you make of that? I can tell you there were special forces soldiers who were operating for the CIA. When they went missing were presumed dead. But I have no idea what they were doing at the embassy, nor what they had to do with this kidnapping. That's why we'd like to question them, find out. CIA can speak with those soldiers as soon as they're conscious and ready for questioning. I appreciate that. It's important for us to work together on this. Of course. You were both at the agency when congressman Wirth died. Yes, sir. That was a tragedy. Yes, sir, it was. Well, I'll let you get back to work. You let me know when they're awake. Those soldiers regained consciousness an hour ago. Sir? Those two soldiers, they regained consciousness an hour ago, so you go out there and you question them. And the CIA? Widener just lied right to my face. Get me some answers and then we'll deal with the CIA. Yes, sir. I'm sorry, Janice. With all these parents being used, they made me promise to follow protocol. Would have been easier to come to Helmand province today. No, I understand. I-I'm just really... Grateful you came. Listen, I'm sorry I didn't call you first. You've been in my thoughts since this happened. Can I get you some coffee? Or can you sit down? Or do you have to wait till they tell you it's safe? I don't really know... How this works. Yeah, it's okay. Gentlemen, I think I'm fine. Listen, I know it's just words, but you should know we are doing everything we possibly can to find Beth Ann and Francis. I know. Thank you, Gabe. I'm, I'm gonna pour some coffee. Or, are, uh, would you prefer tea? I, I think I have tea. Coffee's fine. I'll come with you. I understand the FBI had some questions about Francis. Is there anything you want to ask me about? Is there a connection? Did this happen because Francis was CIA? No, no. You don't kidnap the president's son trying to get to an ex-analyst. So, Janice, why did you ask me to your house and not just come to my office? Do you still take it with cream? That's right. I always knew you'd make a great mom. You would do anything for your daughter. Wouldn't you? You're trembling. Janice, listen to me... It's gonna be okay. It's all going to be... Okay. But I'm not going to drink this. Did you really expect her to pull that off on the head of the CIA? No, I really didn't. That poison wasn't even real. They called me. The kidnappers, they called me... And told me to bring you here. They... They told me I had to poison you. But I knew Widener would be suspicious from the moment my wife called him. I needed him to catch her at something, so he'd lower his guard. They told me to poison you. And now they're gonna kill my family. So why is he really there? Shh. They're still in and out of consciousness and not sure where they are or why they're here. We need to videotape his statement. Look, I know they're important to your investigation, but I can give you a few minutes with them, at most. What happened to them? Medically, I'm not sure. They were in a chemically induced coma. They have older healed wounds, typical of soldiers you see in combat, but... Nothing out of the ordinary. Hawkins is awake now. You get a few minutes with him, that's all. Hey, soldier. How are you doing? Hawkins... Del. Sergeant first class. United States army. 537009185. You're not a prisoner of war. You're in America. We're with the FBI. You're safe here. Can you tell me what happened? Hawkins... Del. Sergeant first class. United States army. 537009185. Can we talk about that mission? Lots of missions, sir. The one with those civilians. Not at liberty to say, sir. Because of what you did? Not at liberty to say, sir. I saw a video of you, Hawkins. A Helmet-Cam. I saw what you did. We killed women and... ...children. No! We killed each other. What was that mission, Hawkins? It's not a mission. It's just training. Training for what? Please... Don't make me do the mission, sir. I'm gonna have to ask you both to leave. We'll stay until we can question them again. That won't happen. The CIA has just served this hospital with a court order to turn over these soldiers. When are they coming for them? They're not coming for them. They're already here. We killed women and... ...children. We killed each other. Sir... Our agents on Janice Gibson reported Widener entering her home. What's he doing in there? His CIA escorts won't let our guys in. Cited national security. Get director Widener on the phone. Please... Don't make me do the mission, sir. Housekeeper teach you that? Asked you a question. My mother... She taught me. And what would she say, if she knew about you and the teacher? Amber? Hey, Amber, look at me. Are you okay? No. No. I don't think I am. You're shaking, what's wrong? The guard. The tall one. They said if we follow the rules, no one would get hurt. That isn't true. He doesn't follow the rules. We have to protect ourselves. How do we do that? I have an idea. Why are you looking at me like that? Like what? Like you know me. I'm, I don't. I-I wasn't. The CIA just cleared the main gate. How many of them were there? Too many for us to stop. They have a court order. Why would you want to stop them? These soldiers connect us to the kidnapper. If the CIA takes them, our connection is lost. I killed a man who tried to take them. You killed a man too. We can't lose that connection now. The CIA had these guys in a hole. They take them back, no one will ever see them again. You know that. You equipped for biohazard containment here? Fully equipped. Why? I should go. I am so sorry... Gabe. Update, please? I'm past two layers of encryption. 20 more minutes and I will have full access to Widener's handset. You're hacking into his phone? They scanned your house before they let Widener in. My job was to teach them their job. They could take that place apart board by board, and they'd never find the equipment I planted there. You want him to stay in your home. Why would he stay after she's tried to kill him? Because... I've always known what Widener wanted. And my wife knows what he's always wanted too. Now what? You're not alone, Janice. I know you feel that way. But you're not. Remember when things got bad with Francis and you had to leave the house? We made it through that, didn't we? I thought about you then. What it would be like. Being together with you. You know, you're not alone? I need more time. If he leaves now, we'll never get it. I'm into Widener's handset and am searching for anything having to do with the soldiers. You think I wanted this? I didn't want this. I didn't want the life I built taken from me. I don't want to put my family or these children in danger. I don't want to wage war against the agency I love. All of these things cause me pain. But the most effective way to deal with pain, is to embrace it is that way... It has no power over you. This is kidnapping. Taking me and these two patients is kidnapping. Yeah. There's a lot of that going around. Give me your phone. And we're saving these guys. You are aware that the people you're trying to keep out will get in before these guys wake up again? That's why you're coming with us. Coming with you where? You might... Want to cover your eyes. You want to do this on your own? You want to find Amber? Then tell me about the guy you're looking for. The man that used to work for you. You said something horrible happened then... And that's why he left. What was it? I didn't ask. Because you didn't want to know. It was that bad, was it? Mrs. Fitch, I've got a hit. Beth Ann, what's going on? Don't do that. Where's the blade, Beth Ann? Why...? You want to protect me? If you want to do something for me, get your Secret Service agent out here and tell me how my father is. Tell us all how Jin Liao is. You're wrong about Hurst. He's a bad guy, Kyle. I'd know if he were bad. Maybe you're just bad at reading people. He's one of them, Kyle. Accept it. Widener's exiting the house. He'll be out of range shortly. Raw data dump from his phone is complete. Initiate level four decryption. The CIA is gonna take those soldiers from the FBI. Then I'm gonna take them from the CIA. I'm done with him. The Huntley... Model 4711 utility knife comes with six blades. This one has four. The fifth one's in the trash. The sixth one's unaccounted for. Everyone, sit down! One of these blades is missing. You have 10 seconds to bring it here. After that, there will be a search. You do not want that to happen. Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One... Line up to be searched. Now! Line up now! Single file! Move! Do we call Olsen? No. We keep him clean of this. Give me your phone. I pulled the ambulance's GPS. This is a mistake. You need to take us back. This is about finding kidnapped kids and I need you to be more of a team player. How are those soldiers doing? Stable... for now. When will they come around again? I don't know. We need to get off this street. Yeah. I got an idea. This room is clear. Can I ask you something? Yeah. - Sure. - When they questioned you back there... What did they want to know? I'm, I'm not allowed to say. Everyone out! Not a noise. Everyone out? But you... What are you doing? You need to leave this room. Here I go. Don't hurt him! Stop! Tell him what you let the teacher do. What? That you let the teacher touch you. I... I let him touch me. That this one here is not good enough for you to even look at. That you're not good enough. Search her. Okay... This room is clear! You do what you need to do to get those soldiers back from the FBI. You find them before the CIA does. I'm working on our alibi. Yeah, how's it going? The kidnapper staged attacks by impersonating law enforcement. We saw the CIA agents and assumed it was an attack on the soldiers. We did what we thought was necessary. And we didn't report it because? I haven't gotten that far. - You think we crossed the line? - Yeah, I do. So, when it comes time to tell the brass what happened here today, you back me up? We tell the same story. Will we tell the same story? Agent Dunn, let me ask you something. How come you don't have a partner? I'm in-between. You're in between a lot. You read my file. You read mine. Ask me anything you want after you tell me why it is you can't keep a partner. Why does it matter? Are you worried you can't trust me? I'm worried that we've been in this knee-deep for four days and you ask me that question. We're here, aren't we? Hey! Hey! Hey! You gotta help me... Help you do what, Hawkins? Help me stay awake. Don't let me sleep. I dreamed of those people. The ones you killed in training? No, the ones they're sending me to kill next. Where? Where are they sending you, Hawkins? Washington, DC. He's gonna make me do it again. Who is? He... he... He is. What is that...? I do know you. Station orange, this is the doctor. Request for pickup. You're not gonna check for keistering? You want to put a blade up there, you can keep it. That's a lot of meds for one kid. Messed-up DC rich kid. Better parenting through chemistry, yo? Don't "yo" me. These, where are the bottles? It's my travel bag. The mother ship Bucket's back at the house. This room is clear! Unbelievable. You're stealing meds from other kids, aren't you? Give me those pills, bro. Like things aren't bad enough? You are going to put these back. The hell I am. I didn't drain any kid. I just took a few off the top. Don't be pissed at me, Kyle. Now that Sloan's gone, you're all I got. Put these back where they belong. Did something happen back there? No, nothing like that. I was just thinking... Thinking about your mother. At least in here, we have each other, and she's all by herself. Yeah. I'm sure we'll be together soon. Dad, we weren't together before. Maybe we can give it another try. This is station orange C0293GH. You're two minutes to extraction. What are you gonna do with these soldiers? - Hey! - I'll put the next one into you. What are you gonna do with these soldiers? Ask your partner's sister. This is station orange C0293GH. We are go for extraction. We are go. You can't take them. We were never here. Go back to sleep. Listen, Beth Ann. Give me the razor blade. How do you know I have it? The first time you showed my that, I thought you were such a bad ass. Hand it over. Why? I'm gonna flush it. They're gonna find it. And then we're screwed. Give it to me. Let me get rid of it. What happened in that room, Ian? Come on. Before we get caught. Finley? You heard what he said, right? About Meg? Yeah, I heard that. When you-you grabbed your gun, you took something. What was it? An I.D. badge. I'm guessing that's not his real name, huh? You believe your sister was involved? Let's go ask her. The soldiers are in our possession. I'm going to take this other call. You need to trace it. Jonas, where are you? I did not sign up for what happened today. I know things got a bit ugly. You did fine. I'm proud of you. My job was to monitor those men. Control their condition. You said when I came to work for you, it'd be about the science. Today was not science. What you want those men to do for you is not science. You've been through something. Let me come to you, we can talk. You have those soldiers, that's what you want. Now, please, - leave me alone. - Where are you, Jonas? I'm gone. Did you get that? I'm sorry, sir. He rerouted it. He will kill you, Ian; He will kill you. Do you understand me? He will end your life. Now, I know you're angry, I know you're angry. I know why. But you do not want to die here, Ian. Beth Ann, help me! He was going after the guard. Help me get this blade from him. Ian, Ian, look at me. Stop! Look at me. It's okay. Ian, stop. Let go. Come on. It's your Secret Service agent. He's the one making this happen. It's gonna be okay. Okay? It's all right. I got him. Hurst! Hurst, can you hear me? I don't believe you'd want this. They must be making you do this. You want me to believe you're bad, then come out here and prove it to me! Hurst! Kyle doesn't believe I'm in on it, you're kinda screwed, right? We're both "kinda" screwed. So what do you want me to do about it? Convince him you're in on it, or I have no more use for you or your daughter. Hurst... You are not my family. You never were my family. You were a job. This is my job now. What? 'Cause I took you fishing, you thought I was your dad? Now give me that blade before I take it from you. You make me come out here again... It will be bad. Put him back in the hole. I'll take that blade, Mr. Hurst. Now you can put me back in the hole. No more lies. Who is he? He used to work for me. Where did you get this? The fact that I have it means he's connected to the kidnapping. You saw him? You're not surprised that I have this? No. That's not his real name, is it? What exactly did he do for you? My company's Pharmaceutical Division had a contract with the Central Intelligence Agency. And Jonas... ran that contract. No, I said what exactly did he do? Exactly, I don't know. It was a classified project, and I didn't have clearance. Why did he stop working for you? The project went bad. And I had to keep my company clean of it. Jonas was connected to it so I severed that relationship. Severed... The relationship with Jonas. Does your husband know you're screwing him? No, my husband doesn't know. To protect yourself, to jeopardize Amber. Of everything you've ever done, of all the things you've taken, this is the worst. Susie, I didn't know about this until yesterday. And what were you planning on doing about it? I did something about it. I tracked him down. He's been off the grid for about six months, but I found his wife. Susie, I know you don't trust me, but everything I've ever done, I've done for Amber. Hey. You had us all scared. How you feeling? I think okay. Just tired. You should rest. Mr. Gibson... I dreamt you were one of them. They listened to you, and you told them what to do. Crazy, right? Now we tell Olsen. No. No? Finley, what you said to me about me and partners, I... That's not what I want to say. What I want to say is. We need to find those kids. So... you need to know the facts. Okay. Amber isn't Meg's daughter. Keep going. You can do it. I can do what? You want to trust me, then trust me. Go ahead. You can do it. Say it. Amber is my daughter. If the FBI finds out about that, they'll have your badge. Yep... They will. So this stays between you and me. Okay. Now we call Olsen. Now we call Olsen. I shouldn't have pushed you. Into calling out Hurst? It's better I know the truth, right? You! Now! That must be Clarenbach's wife Your family has a real thing for wrecking my home. First your sister, now you. Come on in. Honey, I don't know what you had to do, but they're letting us talk to you as a reward. Oh, here's Beth Ann. We're really proud of you. Stay strong. Here she, here she is. It's your mom. Mom? I can't believe I'm actually talking to you. I miss you so much. everyone... Die! - Now! - Hey? What do you want? What do you got? boss? My wife did a horrific thing today so that we could get into Widener's phone. To protect our daughter that's why she did it. So tell me you were able to monitor Widener's secure communications. I was. He'll figure out we've been in there, and shut it down. By then, it'll be too late. So where are the soldiers? Widener called a CIA medical transport at these coordinates. They're headed to a Black Site. Send them new coordinates, please. Then change the route. Let Koz know they're heading his way. What do you think's gonna happen to us? For taking those soldiers? The CIA had a agent in that clinic. They are in no position to press on this. Dunn, look at this. These are those two soldiers, Jonas Clarenbach and Francis Gibson. These are the two guys who are gonna kill innocent people in DC. So is Gibson a hostage or the kidnapper? Downed power line up ahead. Gonna hold you fellas up here just a minute. Enemy neutralized. The soldiers are secure. You have them, boss. Then it was worth it... What she did. It was worth it. - Synced and corrected by Retrojex - - www.addic7ed.com -
