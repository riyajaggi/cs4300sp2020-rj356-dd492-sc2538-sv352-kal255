 Previously on crisis... Meg: Remember, our corporate offices are in new york. If you need anything... We're working with. Homes for humankind to build houses in new york. I'm your mother, amber... I get to worry. I arranged to be the chaperone on the school trip, and they're. Counting on me. You get on the bus, you don't. Talk to me, you don't look at me. This is agent finley's. First inner perimeter assignment. But you'd take a bullet for me, right? I was trained to protect your life. I wouldn't be here if I weren't.

 Koz: We know who you are. We talked to the agents  in that other suv. Movement! Hurst? In 15 seconds, a truck is going to pull up. You are going to get off this bus and onto that truck. "Some of your parents have had tracking devices implanted. Under your skin or in your t... Teeth." Amber: "we have removed these devices. "As you can tell from the way you were taken, "we are professionals. "We are also very comfortable. With the use of force." And I don't want to hear any "you're too emotionally close.

 "To do your job clearly" crap. Because your niece is on that bus. Your sister gives us access. We're not on speaking terms, sir. Now you are. And you just want to see your kid. I know I said I never wanted to, But now... I need to. Francis: You need to ask yourself right now, How far are you willing to go? What would you do for your child? Man: 11 million driven down. From the casino in atlantic city, Six and a half million from the big box stores, And one and three-quarter million from personal loans. From the board of directors. Do you know how hard it is. To get this much actual folding money. In eight hours? Meg... This is not a good idea. As your legal counsel, I am counseling you. To call the fbi. These people who took amber... They also took the president's son. They have eluded detection from what I can only imagine. Must be most of this country's resources. What exactly do you think the fbi can do? They want $20 million in non-traceable cash. I will give it to them... If that's what gets my amber back. That's it? Just her? That's it? And then finley saved my life. This was after finley was shot? And did you see who shot him? I was shot by agent hurst. Woman: Your partner. As of yesterday. I had never met him before; I'd heard of him, though. He's a legend in the service. A man who used to run the president's detail, A pistol instructor at the academy, Shoots you at close range. So my question for you, agent finley, is: How come you're not dead? I've been asking myself that very same question. Sometimes when you're real scared... That's not technically true. What? What's not true? That fear degrades the integrity of the human memory. In fact, the action of the adrenal-cortical system. Causes hyper-alertness. This is what happened. Finley saved me. He killed that man who wanted to take me. Dunn: The agent you replaced in the car? Valens. Hurst said he had the flu. Agent valens is missing. We can't find him anywhere. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Hurst said he had the flu. The voice on the walkie, the man you talked to, That wasn't hurst? No. Had you ever heard it before? No. So when do I get my badge. And my gun back? I need to get back out there. No. You lost those kids, agent finley. You're off the field. All of my life, all I ever wanted to be. Was a secret service agent. Well, I hope you enjoyed the one day. You finally got to be one. Your next interrogator is here. Have they made any demands? ¶ ¶ Let's place the next call. Man: I'm sure your brother  will be home soon. He's just on a trip with some friends. Hello? Francis: Mr. Ambassador. Who is this? I need you to ask yourself what will you do for your child. How far will you go? Woman: Ballard school grid completed. Woman: Students' gps trackers not responding. Finley: Movement! Hurst? Worst first day ever, huh, bitch? Pick it up. Pick up the pencil. I need you to copy this. You what? I need it written in your hand. So it looks like me who did all this? You'll be admired... Agent hurst, when this is over. The meticulous planning, the sheer vision. But now you have a lot of work to do, So I need you to begin. Start here. Woman: My husband called. Two days ago, said that he'd taken. Our daughter tory, and not to tell anyone. Or it would be bad for her. I guess I never knew him. Is that the man my husband shot? Excuse me. Just what the hell do you think. You're doing here, secret service? This is where the fbi works. Agent finley, I thought I made it clear. You are not working this. Yes, agent dunn, you did. This is a secure floor; How did you get in here? I invited him. Don't you have work to do? Before you speak, I want you to listen. Agent finley here is the only person. Who has seen the faces of the kidnappers, The only person who has heard their actual voices. Only person to have killed one of them, If you're counting. You may speak when I point to you. So he's with you. With me for-for how long? Until I say he's not with you. Sir, with me as fbi, As secret service? Olsen: With you as our only lead. On the day when the u.S. President's son. Has been kidnapped with you. Woman: Director olsen, We got a hit on hurst's car. Go. Both of you. Now. Thank you. Ian: Hey. You have to talk, beth ann. You have to say something. You know what I was thinking about? What you said on the bus. You were gonna run away when we got to new york. You meant that, didn't you? You weren't kidding. It'd be pretty messed up if you were gonna run away. And ended up getting kidnapped. That's me... pretty messed up. They used a knife on him, ian. And they made us watch. : I know. Does it say anything about hurst? Do you see anything about him? Here. "Unconfirmed involvement. With kyle devore's protective detail." Kyle: Anything about why hurst did it? Amber: No, but they arrested anton's dad. What? Here, look. They said they arrested anton's dad. They're not saying why. Sloan: Does anyone even know anton's dad? Luke: The whole country's looking for us. How can they not find us? They shot down a drone. "a top secret drone "was downed in maryland yesterday "in search of the children. Of the world's most powerful parents." Guess that means they're not looking for you and me. Nash: And what about demands? Does anyone see if the kidnappers have made any? No. It says here no group has come forward. To claim responsibility and no demands have been made. We know that's not true. Girl: How do we know that? Because of this newspaper. Because amber got a proof-of-life picture taken. They're negotiating with her parents. Right now. He's right. If they took that picture, that means they're negotiating. With your parents, amber. Sloan: But why just her? Beth ann: Because her mom has. The most money. Will she pay it? So you're getting out of here. You're going home. I can't be the only one. Find your clothes! Now! If you have meds, they are in this box. Move! Where's my father? Why won't you let him come back out? Answer me! Is he okay? Man:  The voice on the phone asked. What we'd do for our child. Will we kill? Will we take another's life? For that is what we must do now. Dunn: You asked him to put you on this, Didn't you? You went to olsen. I pointed out to him what I had seen. And suggested that I could be useful to this operation. That man I killed... you I.D. The body? Nope. No match on prints, dental or dna. The guy was a ghost. Felt like special forces, though... guy was tough. But you were tougher. Yes, ma'am, in that moment, I was. Tough and useful, And yet 26 kids go missing on your watch. You still think I'm in on it. No, I don't. I just think you're real bad at your job, Agent finley. Make the right up ahead. They're all going straight. They will all get stuck at the bridge. You want to make the right. Meg. Noah. There was no reception until we got back to the trail head. Is it true? Was amber on that bus? Yes. Someone took her. Oh, my god. Who? Who has her? We don't know. So she's just out there somewhere? Nobody knows anything? Did you talk to your sister? Yes. She says just to sit tight. And let the fbi do their job. This is about the president's kid, right? And once they deal with that, They'll let amber and the rest go, won't they? Don't you think, meg? Are you okay? I-I don't know how I am. This is like a bad dream. I mean, she was just here. There's a plane waiting for you. Get on it and come home, noah. Okay. Girl: Rachmaninoff. Six moments musicaux. The first piece,  andantino in b-flat minor, Is 113 measures long. Sharlene, you okay? E-flat minor, Played at 92 quarter notes per minute. 131 measures long, the most of all the pieces. Can you shut your friend up, please? Very compassionate, luke. 131, the second shortest in terms of playing time. Just three and a half minutes. Shar, look at me. Look at me, shar! I got to get out of here. Right now. I have to go. My audition slot at julliard in new york. Ten years, five hours a day. I can't be here, I just can't. They'll hold your slot. I promise. I need them to take my picture. I need them to take my picture like yours so I can go. You. No... Will you take my picture? You. The ambassador's kid, Come with me. Sharlene: Why him? Boy: No, no... Why not me? Why him? No, no, no, no! No! No! He doesn't have a camera. Boy: Please, please, no! This is different. A decorated secret service agent. And loving father steals his own kid, Then kidnaps the president's son. That add up to you, dunn? It's agent dunn. And he shot you, right? You did see him shoot you? Yeah, but like you said, why didn't he kill me? I'm working on that. You want to wait for backup, agent dunn? Not especially. You? Olsen gave it back to me. Fbi! Secret service! It's valens. Hurst's partner. He's still alive. What's with the mattress? Muffles the sound. Hurst said valens called in sick... the flu. I'll call this in. Call fbi, not secret service. We get this first. I'll call an ambulance first. Secret service! Yeah, me too. So how about you just lower that knife? I don't know you. And I don't know you. I'm fbi. Yeah? Since when do secret service and fbi. Work together? Step away from her. And we'll talk about that. Where's hurst? That's what we're trying to find out. Step away from her and help us. Where the hell is hurst?! Looks like he tied you up and left you here. And then kidnapped the president's kid. That is crazy. You tell me what is going on. Right now. I'm gonna turn this on. Woman: ...With all airports and borders. Still closed in the wake of yesterday's kidnapping. Another ballard student, emma breen, has been... First time in history a sitting president's child. Has been abducted. There's no official word yet... Kyle? Now... You give me my knife back, or I blow. A hole right through you. Where's aziz? What have you done with him? And where is beth ann's father? Sort... The... Clothing. Amber: Why would they take my picture. But not aziz's? Maybe they're taking it back there. Didn't sound like they were taking his picture. Does anyone still hear him? No. Not anymore. You're standing on my shirt. Yo. Zombie. You're on my shirt. Sorry. Look what you did. I said I was sorry. You ripped my shirt. Take it easy, luke. It's just a shirt; She said she was sorry. You know what this shirt costs? I think you're overreacting. Maybe it's not about the shirt. Don't tell me I'm overreacting. This shirt costs more than. Your low-rent dad makes in a week. What the hell is wrong with you? Why do you have to be such a dick? Back off, food stamp. Luke, that's enough! Quit it. Quit it now, luke. Lighten up, kyle. Keep it. It's ruined anyway. Sorry. He can be a dick sometimes. He's always a dick. And I can take care of myself, thanks. Everyone on the floor! Now! On the floor! Down! No one talks! Silence! : Drone. It's a drone. Francis:  Stanton park, first bench. Northeast corner. I have left a package for you. Bring it into your embassy. Do not open it. This is the right one? The voice said to look here, yes. We should go to the fbi. We are way beyond that. When it comes back, same drill: On the floor, mouths shut! It was a drone, looking for us. Jin: They must have this place shielded against. Thermal imaging, but if we make noise, the drone could hear us. So what do we do if it comes back? If it can hear us, we can't just stay quiet, right? Sloan: If we make noise, We'll just end up like aziz and beth ann's dad. But if it passes by again and finds nothing, Then they'll cross this place off their search. We do nothing. We stay quiet. They took your picture, amber. They're negotiating with your parents. If you get out, you can tell people. What this place looks like. Amber, it's very important for you. To remember as much as you can. Don't worry about that, mr. Nash. Okay, so it's agreed. If it comes back, we lay on the ground. And we keep quiet. Valens: Last thing I remember, I was in the car having coffee with hurst. Then I felt dizzy. I woke up in that room. With you looking at me, and... Sorry about that. I didn't know who you were. How's the throat? Where'd you get the coffee? Hurst brought it to the car. Hurst gets you out of the way, Puts a newbie on the detail, then the kidnapping goes easier. And he doesn't have to shoot a friend. No way hurst has anything to do with this. I've known him forever. He's the guy who takes a bullet. Maybe I should show you the hole he put in agent finley's side. Where'd he get you? Between the fastener on the vest. Hell of a shot. Yes. The secret service has. An excellent record of marksmanship. Agent valens, in the period of time. Preceding hurst dosing your coffee. And rendering you unconscious, Did you notice anything peculiar about his behavior? That day, we were doing routine security runs, Checking routes... just the two of us. And he took 60 minutes of personal time. Where'd he go? I don't know. Where were you? Waiting in the car. You didn't ask him where he went? He's a man. He took personal time. What else do I need to know? And where exactly were you. When agent hurst took his personal time? I want to see my kid. And I want to see mine. Your daughter is in the other room. Yes, but she won't let me see her. Not really see her. You're a father. You understand. Your daughter hears things, She sees things, and... Then she closes her heart. And that's how your book ends? One big, happy family? Your kid giving you a "father of the year" coffee mug? I think it's time for you, agent hurst, To go into the hole. You said I could see my kid. There you go. Where's the money now? It's moving. Hello? Look out the window. Do you know where you are? I'm where you told me to go. Have you ever been here before? No, I don't think so. I don't think so, either. This is where. The people who work for the people who work for you live. Is this where you live? You want to know about me? Here's what you need to know. I'm the man with a gun to your daughter's head. Please don't hurt her. I brought the money you asked me to. What do you want me to do? In a magazine interview, You once said that being a parent. Is the most difficult job in the world. Do you really believe that? Yes. You said, "amber." Is what makes life worthwhile." Do you believe that? Yes. Then take that left ahead, go down the ramp. And prove it. Out of the car, ms. Fitch. Leave the keys. Over there in the trunk. Susie... It's meg. I screwed up. Bad. I need help. Meg: A phone was sent to me. I got a call. A processed voice told me that. If I wanted to see amber again, To get that money together and where to take it. I'd have given them anything. Keep going. What happened next? A man who looked homeless, um, Took the money, and... All they left was this. Never thought of calling the fbi? If not me, why would you trust me with this. Than one of the other 10,000 agents working on this today? I thought... I thought I could get her back. I thought that if I did this. That... She'd be in my arms by now. I'm sorry. Sorry you did it or sorry. It didn't work out the way you wanted? Now, that's enough. I did what I thought was best for amber. That's just you though, isn't it, meg? Always what you think is best. Well, why would I not do what I think is best? What good would that do? There are other people in the world besides you. Yes. My daughter is one of them. Will you be arresting me now? It's not illegal to pay a ransom. But lying to a federal agent is. I told you everything. The phone they called you on? The man took it with the money. Amber's photo was all you got? Yes. Susie, all our kids. Are worth more than $20 million. They wanted cash from me. Cash is for now. I just paid for whatever they're gonna do next. Okay. Okay what? Okay, luke is a dick. All the time. Then how come he's your friend? I don't know. Just kind of always has been, I guess. So that's how you live it, huh? It is what it is. Must be nice. Oh. I get it. Get what? You're one of those people who thinks. They know me because of where I live. That's cool. I just wanted to say I'm sorry and see how you were doing. But whatever. Super boy. I'm not living off food stamps or anything. It was just that... You got issues with your dad and luke pushed the button. What was that about? I'm not really sure. Beth ann, no one's paying our ransom. When that drone comes back... I know. May be our only chance. How come you're still here? I'm working on what happened. How come you're still here? My mom is talking to my dad's lawyer. Did you get stitched up? Yeah. Good as new. You figure out why your partner shot you? Between us, I think someone made him do it. But it's just a hunch. The stomach has more nerve cells than the spinal cord, So there is a scientific basis for gut feelings. What's with the map? The man that shot me spent an hour here. The other day without telling his partner what he was doing. Can I ask you a question? Out on that road, how come you picked me? Why was I the one you saved? You were the only one I could get to, anton. But, look... Don't feel bad. I usually don't get picked for stuff. Anton, the pakistani ambassador had a kid on that bus, right? Yeah. Aziz. Why? Man: Now you need to go. I don't want to leave you. You can't be here when it happens. You can't be anywhere near. Come back when it's over. Our son will need you when it's over. That thing you said about my dad, My issues... Why'd you say that? You weren't talking to him when you got here. That's pretty harsh. Considering the circumstances. And I know you think I'm a golden boy, But I got a pretty messed up relationship with my dad, too. Super boy. I said "super boy," not "golden boy." Gunman: Everyone in here and down. Now! What did your sister want? She did something stupid. I'm having one of the other agents deal with it. You want to tell me about it? Nope. I want to figure out why hurst took his personal time. A block from the pakistani embassy. Francis: At 4:15, a large hostile force. Will enter your embassy. You must accomplish the second part of your mission. Before then. Your son misses you very much. The fbi have come about aziz. What are you talking about? There are two in the waiting room. Dunn: Mr. Ambassador, May we have a word? Yes. Please come in. Is everything okay here? It has been a stressful time. Mr. Ambassador, according to your security logs, A secret service agent hurst came to see you. Yes, he... Came to speak with me about the bus trip. Finley: That would be something. He would speak to your own security about. There would be no need to see you in person. I thought it was odd. Dunn: Are you sure you don't want to sit down? You're not looking well. Mr. Ambassador, at any time. After agent hurst came to see you, Did you find a cell phone in your office? A phone which your own security would not have allowed. Through any other way? You need to go now. A phone upon which instructions were issued to you? I see you have a look on your face that I've seen before. The look of a parent being forced to do something. For his child. This is sovereign territory. Of the republic of pakistan; You have no authority here. You need to go. Foreign territory in the middle of d.C. If you want to hide something from american authorities, This would be the place to put it. Finley, lock the door. Mr. Ambassador, you want us out, but you haven't called security. Why? Please... You need to help me. Help you do what? Help me kill this man. Help! Help! Help us! Could you please help us! Please help us! You two. Backs against the wall. Koz: You were looking. For the troublemakers; There they are. We still going through with it? Yes. We are. Where's the ambassador? Where's the ambassador?! In his office. Turn the first one on. Sir, we've got a live tracker. Who is he? He's the intelligence officer here. Finley: And what happens when you kill him? I take the key card he carries around his neck. I open that door. Finley: What's behind that door? I don't know. He doesn't work for me. He runs our spies here. Dunn. Kyle devore's gps is back online. We tracked it to the pakistani embassy. The president's son could be in that building. Swat should be on scene. You hear what olsen said? Yes, ma'am, I did. It's gonna take a while for swat to get through security. Do you want to wait for backup? Not especially, no. Get him up here. Do it now. If you want that key card, You'll have to kill him. Make the call. Where's that door? If you know what's behind this door, Now would be a good time to tell us. I don't know. I don't want to know. Dunn, are you seeing this? Rangers. These are americans. What is going on here? Man: Station orange c-0-2-9-3. Code word. Station orange c-0-2-9-3. Code word. Fbi is pulling the soldiers out now. They were reported missing in action, No one was looking for them, but you got the fbi. To storm a foreign embassy. And pull the soldiers out of that basement. You did it. Not yet. Almost. Let's give the fbi enough time. To take a good long look at those soldiers. Then we finish this. Dunn. Tell me what you see. Two men, mid-20s, both unconscious. Dunn, are they american? They've been through something, Both pretty ragged, but yes, these look like our boys, sir. What the hell were they doing down there? I don't know. And kyle devore's chip? It was in a box on the ambassador's desk. Blue team. Checking in. Copy. About to clear the embassy. Man: Alpha, what's your status? Francis: That's long enough. Are we ready for extraction? Assets are in place. Then let's take those soldiers. Shut down the fbi communication system. I want them dumb and blind now. Turn the other tracker on. Tracker two coming online in three, two, one. Sir, another hostage's gps tracker is coming back online. but... Olsen: But what? But this can't be right. Where is it coming from? Right here. It's tracking to this building, sir. Dunn? Dunn, are you there? Sir? Sir? Man: All our lines are in lockdown. Locating the tracker here set off. The internal fbi security protocol. The line went dead. Lost radio contact. This is not right. Very not right. The kidnapper used the ambassador. To open that basement door, and the fbi. To get these soldiers out onto the street. So, what does he do next? How do they look? Vital signs are very low; Pulse, respiration, Blood pressure, well below normal. What was happening here? We're working that out. We're gonna move them now. What hospital you taking them to? Collins general. We're gonna ride with you. No problem. We can take you both if you want. Worst first day ever, huh, bitch? Finley? Yeah. I met that guy before. He was there when they took the kids. You said they all had masks. Some things people say to you, you just never forget. Okay. Maybe not really bad at your job. I've got shots fired, men down. Where are the soldiers? Fbi has them. Our men are dead. Fbi has both soldiers. Kill the kid. He's en route. I'll make the call. Hmm. Wait. Wait. His parents did as I asked. We got in that room. They did what I asked them. Aah! We failed, not them. Now what? Now, we call the next parent and the next parent and the next. Until I'm shaking the president's hand. In the rose garden, and he's thanking me. For my service to this country. But they kept those soldiers alive. That means the lenox program's still operational. There's more proof out there. Open a secure line. Deal with the troublemakers. What does "no talking" mean? Both: No talking. Man: Station orange c-0-2-9-3. Code word. That's a cia station message. That pakistani isi officer was calling his cia handler. It's a black site. A cia black site inside the d.C. Pakistani embassy. Why would the cia hold american soldiers there? Why does the kidnapper want them? Gps tracker. This is the source. ¶ Sometimes I feel like a motherless child ¶ ¶ sometimes I feel like a motherless child ¶ ¶ sometimes I feel like a motherless child ¶ ¶ just a long way from my home... ¶ The boy you let go...
