 Previously on Crisis... [distored] You can have five kids, right now. We only need one thing from you: Secret Service Agent Marcus Finley. We do have laser trip wires. They were ready for us. - Send the kids, I'm here! - Send the kids now. DUNN: There. That's Gibson, there with the hostages. He's not the one doing the talking. - What about Finley? - For now? He's on his own.

 This is SWAT secure 28-19. I am on online and request radio check of all units. How'd you get her in there? She's one of them. She's a cop. If my dad says he has a plan, then he has a plan. This is what happens when you say "no" to our demands, Mr. President... [gunshot, Francis groans] A hostage was just released. I'm standing here with Amber Fitch. She'd very much like to speak to her mother. 1x12 - This Wasn't Supposed to Happen [cloth tearing] [heavy breath] You're losing a lot of blood. - So it would seem. - Was this arranged,

 - or did your men turn on you? - You were there. - What'd you see? - I saw you take a bullet for Kyle! - Ah! - Now you tell me if they're really gonna kill him, or was this just for the cameras? I don't know, Agent Finley! [panting] Look, if he doesn't get proper medical attention, - he'll die soon. - Within the hour, the FBI'll sling his hero ass on a medevac chopper. It's time to save Tory Hurst. Repeat, time to save Tory Hurst. Hello, 911? There's a girl crying in the apartment upstairs. All day and night. The man who lives there has no children. Can you send someone? Tory Hurst? She's the daughter of that dead Secret Service agent. Yes, she is. - And she's not here. - No, she's not. So, what does she have to do with our escape? You know, I know being a scientist makes you curious, but stop asking questions. Go get that gear on. It's time to go. I have two Black Hawks inbound. 30 minutes out, 16 men. We push flashbangs through the window, fast rope to the roof... 45 seconds later, it's over. - And if the roof is rigged? - That's the risk. Do it. Get them out of there. CLARENBACH: Francis was always a one for checklists. "Is," Doc, not "was." He's not dead. Go start the fire in the East wing. When you smell smoke, count 30, deactivate the mines. Both of you follow Doc and I into the tunnels. She'll have a Humvee waiting for us on the other side. - And we're free and away. - And the kids? And Gibson? Look, I know, I'm sorry, but you're torching the place and he is still locked up. He escapes, saves the kids... and it's a happy ending kind of story. They're coming now. The FBI. After that show you put on upstairs, they'll come, mines or not. Then they'll all die. The kids, too. The house is rigged! [panting] The coal chute over there is painted shut. If you can get in there... [panting] ...maybe you can get out and save them. - I'm supposed to believe that? - Believe whatever you want, but I'm dying, so it's up to you. Vehicle's in position. Be advised, Black Hawks are 20 minutes out. KOZ: We are three minutes from the burn, and we'll be gone by then. I'm gonna scrub these computers. Hey. You ready for Tahiti? Wait a minute. This isn't right. DUTTON: What? [tapping key] - This can't be right. - What's the matter? Stand by. Change of plans. [alarm beeping] Get Gibson. He's coming with us. - Those weren't the orders. - They are now. I got one thing to do and then we're gonna meet in the tunnels. And the kids? If Gibson's with you, who's gonna save them from the fire? Not my problem. My contract's been broken. I'll get you out of here, you can come with us, but then you're on your own. [indistinct conversations] We have fire on the Eastern side of the mansion, sir. Upper floors, spreading fast. - Black Hawks? - Eight minutes out. Any sign of Finley? [breathing hard] [groans] Smoke... Who set the fire? You, stay back. Over there. What are you doing? - You're coming with me. - No! Stop! You can't take me! I need to be with my daughter! No! No... Finley, help. I'm not playing this game, Mr. Gibson. I don't believe you. - Ah... - You want my help, you tell the truth. I did it. I made those calls. sync & correction by f1nc0 ~ Addic7ed.com ~  [kids shouting, screaming] Help us! Help! [coughing] Help! Come on. [panting] - Stay against the wall. - What are you doing? I'll see you later, Mr. Gibson. [gunshot] [grunting, choking] [panting] - That was the truth, wasn't it? - How can you be sure? Because you weren't talking like a hero trying to save all the kids. What was I talking like? Like a father terrified of losing his daughter. - Kyle! - KYLE: I'm here! Do you know where the kids are? They're in the bedrooms. They're zip-tied together. Take this. Cut them loose. Get them to the front door... - What? - ...and ready to run for it. Kyle. You can do this. Whatever Hurst was, I know he taught you how to act when things go bad. Focus on what you need to do and where you need to be. You can do this. - Tell me. - I can do this. Fire is spreading to all floors. My choppers are 4 minutes out. [Gibson gasping] [both coughing] FINLEY: What do we do? - Everything's gone. - What do we do?! [groans] Gotta... check the status of the... status of the mines. - Where? - Here. Here, here. Over there. - FRANCIS: What does it say? - FINLEY: Armed. [groans] The mines are still armed. Okay, how do we turn them off? How do we turn them off? Gibson! [kids shouting] Gibson, listen to me. How do I turn off the mines? You want to save Beth Ann? How do I turn off the mines? IAN: Help us! [coughing] - Kyle. - We have to get everyone out. They have us in both bedrooms. - Okay. This one first. - Yeah. [coughs] They were shutting it all down. [helicopters whirring] No. Not yet. Not yet! BLACK HAWK PILOT: We are on station and ready. I recognize this. A dedicated police terminal. You were using cops? [coughing] [typing] __ Sir. Something you need to see. This is a dedicated police terminal, not Internet linked. They use radio signals to communicate with each other. - Go on. - I think your man inside the mansion is on the other end of this one. Hold those choppers. How do we know that's Finley and not the kidnapper? __ [coughs] __ It's Finley. "Where is Gibson?" __ OLSEN: Get bomb squad on this so they can walk Finley through what he needs to do. [birds chirping in distance] HRT COMMANDER: Laser trip wires are still armed. __ Great. Tech support. __ His kid, Gibson's kid. Try-try the password "Beth Ann." __ [coughing] "Hey, Tahiti, I know you're out there. Whatever you've done, I don't think you signed up - to let these kids burn to death." - Who the hell is Tahiti? KOZ: We're out of the building. Do you read me? We're in the tunnel and three minutes from extraction point. DUTTON: Copy. We're going out right beneath them. - Gibson thinks of everything. - Almost everything. It's time for you to get out. Do you copy? Do you copy? [computer beeping] - Who sent that message? - Terminal reads as unidentified. How many of those do we have here? Including the mobile units on-site, tactical, and the command center here, maybe 50. I'm on it. HRT COMMANDER: Trip wires deactivated. Okay, go! Send them all. [loud crash] - OLSEN: Do you have the hostages? - HRT MEMBER: Negative. Clearing bedrooms. Agent Finley, Secret Service. Where are the kids? Have you found the kids? This is Gray Four. We have Finley, plus one. - Do we have the hostages? - We're taking them right out. [all clapping] They're at the front. We're taking them out right now. - We'll take him. - No. I got him. - DUNN: Are you okay? - FINLEY: Just a little smoke inhalation.  I got something to do before I take care of that. Whoever responded to my messages was a genuine law enforcement officer. It makes sense. The kidnappers have been messing with our communications from the start. They turned one of our own people. You called him Tahiti. Why? There was a postcard taped to the back of the police terminal. - Where he's going after this, I bet. - Not yet. But where's he been? If he's been in there helping them, then he hasn't been at his regular job. We're looking for somebody who's been away on leave. And who came back just in time to be Gibson's eyes and ears here in ICC while we had him surrounded. We need to find him. - We can't use anyone here. - DUNN: I'll call the HQ. Communications specialist, Maryland state trooper. Came back from leave just to work this standoff. - Where does she sit? - Right over there. Dutton... where is she? We're clear. That's one thing that went right. Ma'am, you can't go back there. I'm looking for my daughter. Her name's Amber. - Amber Fitch. - I'm sure she'll be out soon. They told me I could see her hours ago. She was released before the others. Why isn't she out here? - What's happened to her? - I will find out. Just wait here? - Why is Amber still in medical? - I don't know. Please come with me. All of these children went through something. But something different happened to her. - What? - Your daughter tried to leave the medical tent and head back to the mansion. She fought the agents who tried to stop her. We sedated her, but she's awake now. I can bring you to her. Susie, I... Maybe now is not the right time to meet her Aunt Susie. Soon. [clears throat] - Did you see her? - No, but, uh, but she... - She's alive. - Yeah. She's alive. - Finley, you got the kids back. - We got the kids. Fire's been knocked down, teams are searching the building. We'll know soon how many survivors we have. Will we? We have an APB out on Dutton. But we never had a headcount on the kidnappers. Right, these people have a plan for everything. What was their plan for you? Me? I was the star witness for the Gibson show. I could testify that he was treated just like any other hostage. That I saw him abused. That he took a bullet to save Kyle. But something went wrong. Gibson's people turned on him. He was desperate and scared. He admitted to me that he was the kidnapper. - So, why isn't he under arrest? - Can't use the confession. He had a gun to his head. Well, they may have turned on him. But he came out of there a hero who almost died saving the president's son. And we don't have a single piece of hard evidence against him. - OLSEN: Where is Gibson now? - FINLEY: Stabilized. They're about to move him for surgery. [indistinct commentary on TV] There are reports that Francis Gibson took a bullet for young Kyle,  and saved his life. [commentary continues] [low crying] It's okay, Janice. Don't worry. I'll be all right. Just go be with Beth Ann. [crying] Beth Ann didn't come out. She's missing. No, that's impossible. After an anonymous tip led to the rescue of Tory Hurst,  eight-year-old daughter of slain Secret Service agent Albert Hurst, her suspected abductor, Thomas Jefferson Smith, has been apprehended. A disgruntled former CIA agent, he is suspected to be the mastermind behind the Ballard kidnapping. The FBI displayed further proof of this when money tied to a ransom had been found connected to Jefferson Smith. DUNN: How's jail? - I'm getting by. - Getting by but never getting out. We tied Tory Hurst to you and that ransom money. Guess that means you're the Ballard kidnapping mastermind. Oh, come on. We know who tied the Hurst girl - and the money to me. - You mean Francis Gibson. I didn't think he had it in him, actually. I didn't see that when I was training him. But you don't really have anything on him now, do you? I mean, he kind of came out of there clean. A hero, actually. But now his daughter is missing. Uh-huh. I haven't seen her. What about your boss, Widener? Did he have her taken? Does Widener want Gibson to do something - to get her back? - Oh, hell, no. I'd hate to see what Francis Gibson would do to get his own daughter back. Be kind of messy, actually. Did Widener have Beth Ann taken? I don't know Gabe Widener. Sorry. And my advice on Gibson? You either arrest him, you kill him... or you find his daughter. He's way too dangerous for anything else. [laughs] BETH ANN: Daddy? Daddy, help me. Daddy, pelase? Beth Ann. Beth Ann? Please, just do what they want. Who are they? Who has you? [line clicks] REPORTER: Authorities are still asking for help in locating the whereabouts of this woman, Maryland state trooper Alicia Dutton, in relation to the Ballard School kidnapping. She is thought to have taken the last remaining hostage, Beth Ann Gibson. Maintenance guy thinks he saw Dutton around four hours ago. Remember, she's a cop. She will not go quietly. All clear. Living in this dump wasn't the plan. She didn't expect to be here. - Something went wrong. - There were two people at that table. Maybe she's running with Gibson's number two, the redhead. They left in a hurry. Someone was taped down to this bed. Dunn. They're scared. - Do you know why they're scared? - Who? Your two ex-employees. The people who took your daughter. They're scared because they don't have you and your plans anymore. No more mansions, no more downed drones. Now it's your daughter taped to a bed. DUNN: Your crew turned on you. Why? - Did someone get to them? - I don't have a crew, Agent Dunn. You admitted to me you were the kidnapper. Come clean on record, help us find your daughter. What I said to you in the fire, you thought I was the kidnapper. I knew the only way to get your help was to give you a false confession. I'd lie to you again if it meant Beth Ann's safe return. But I can't tell you what I don't know. You know they took Beth Ann to use you. - What do they want you to do? - I don't know! You're the powerful parent now, just like the parents you used. Did you get a call? No, the FBI escort's been outside my door since I woke up. - Going home now? - Yes, to see my wife. Big reunion. Nice of her to let you back in the house. But you're the hero now. What choice does she have? What does Francis Gibson do to get his daughter back? Press is at the house... - all the time. - I'm sorry. - The FBI still follows me. - Because of Beth Ann. Why are we the only ones? Why is Beth Ann the only one still lost? [ringing] You gonna pick it up? Hello. [static] Just tell me what you want. Just say it! - Who was that? - I don't know. - Was it Widener? - I said I don't know. You need to stay away from him. You don't know him. - He-he threatened our daughter's life. - I don't believe that. - You need to trust me, Janice. - Trust? Okay, trust. Tell me, do you know who the kidnapper is, Francis? They caught the man who did that. What did you tell me about your business? "It's never the men you see, it's always the men you don't." You need to trust me now. I promise you I will get her back. Tell me, did they ask you to do something? Have you gotten a call? No, Francis. Have you? The paper you found where they were holding Beth Ann Gibson still had a few words on it. FINLEY: What's gonna self-destruct on Sunday? [phone rings] BETH ANN: Daddy? Daddy, help me. Beth Ann, who has you? [man distorted] Francis Gibson, you need to ask yourself, what will you do to get your daughter back? You know they're tapping my phone. You know we can get around that. What do you want? Not yet. Tomorrow, you'll do something even you could not have imagined. Let me talk to Widener. Tomorrow, Francis. And then you get Beth Ann back. [line clicks] What do they want you to do? Sir, there's an anomaly on the Gibson house phone tap. What kind of anomaly? - 73 seconds of pure static. - Play it. - [buzzing static] When was this? - An hour ago. We didn't pick it up in real time. Only when we reviewed and filtered the tapes. That's it. That was Gibson getting the kidnappers' call. Contact Gibson's handlers and find him right now. You need to let me in. Why would I do that? I have something for you. The reason why your daughter's so much more broken than the others. Bring him in. They're reporting that he's moved positions. Dunn, Gibson is at your sister's house. What do you want from me that you're offering information about my daughter's state of mind? Widener's going to use me. I would guess in some way against you. He hates the both of us. Maybe we could help each other. You want us to work together? - I want my daughter. - I see. All right, Mr. Gibson, you first. Why don't you tell me what you know about Amber? - You know the teacher died in there? - Yes, Mr. Nash. They were, uh, intimate, the teacher and your daughter. No one knew. I could see it. She was in a relationship with the man who died in her arms. You didn't know, did you? So sorry for what this must make you feel as her mother. But we had a bargain. Now you. Gabe Widener. Widener called me... to see if I'd help him find your money. - I declined. - Why? Because you killed that boy. And after you killed that boy, all I wanted was Amber back so I could protect her, away from you. Did you kill him yourself, Mr. Gibson... ...or did you have somebody else do it? What does Widener want with the kidnappers' money? Turn your men against you. I take it that's happened. I said I wouldn't help, but now I wish that I had. I wonder what he'll make you do to get your daughter back. I'd have a long list. And it would end with you begging. [door opens] Mr. Gibson was just leaving. What's going to self-destruct on Sunday, Mr. Gibson? - You're hurting me, Agent Finley. - Did you receive a call? You're tapping my phone. You heard it. Static. I just want them to tell me what to do, and all I heard was static. You're not gonna find her, are you? I'd like my FBI escort to take me home now. He wanted to know if I... - helped Widener take his money. - Why did you let him in? I needed to see if I could look at him. If I was strong enough. We need to search this place. There's been a threat. - You need to leave until it's clear. - I'll go get Amber. How is she? Why don't you come see for yourself? Still won't talk about it? Not a word of what went on in there. Just this. You're not gonna get Gibson, are you? He'll get away with it. Amber... your Aunt Susie's here. Uh... may I? Sure. I'm making one for each of my classmates. You used your yearbook. It's a funny way for us to finally meet, huh? Yeah. Guess so. AMBER: You're the one who found us? One of the agents. Yeah. How come it took you so long? How come you left us in there for so long? She's strong. She'll heal. - How do you know that? - I know her mother. She's strong. What if this is all still Gibson? It's not. Because he got everything he wanted except his daughter. Someone is going to use him this time. It's after midnight. Tomorrow is Sunday. That piece of paper said "self-destruct... Sunday." - We have less than 24 hours. - We have to find Beth Ann and we have to find the people that have her. I got an idea about that. To have come through what you both have and for it still not to be over... I can't imagine. Do you have anything to say to the people who have your daughter? Actually, I have something to say to them. Agent Finley. The true hero, the man who saved my life. Please... - Do you mind? - No. Please, go ahead. I am speaking to Alicia Dutton, the woman who has Beth Ann Gibson. The cop who helped me save those kids in that fire. We know who you are. We know your name, your face, where you grew up. We know your friends and your family. You're burned; you know that. DUNN: The interview starts at 8:00. Finley's on six minutes in. Call comes in, we trace it and hit it hard. 30 seconds from start. Don't get too attached to her. Come on, Gibson's gonna be on TV. I'll get us a couple of beers. REPORTER: Can I ask... you were living apart before this happened. Has this brought you together in some way? We're her parents...  Beth Ann's... and we want her to know that we are here waiting for her. That we are here together. - Light or regular? - Light. REPORTER: To have come through what you both have and for it still not to be over... Here we go. - FINLEY: Do you mind? - REPORTER: No. Please, go ahead. I am speaking to Alicia Dutton, the woman who has Beth Ann Gibson. The cop who helped me save those kids in that fire. We know who you are. We know your name, your face, where you grew up. We know your friends and your family. You can't run. We will find you. You're burned; you know that. You call me, you bring back that girl... and we can help you. [indistinct commentary on TV] - Don't let Finley get in your head. - Okay. The buyer's almost here. He's five minutes out. We make the swap, they get the girl, we get the money back that they took from us, we're gone. - Tahiti. - Tahiti. No, no, a-a-absolutely not.  Ballard has given our daughter a wonderful... Got a text. A D.C. street address, but in a foreign country? - What country? - Tahiti. The address is here, but then it says "Tahiti." The address is here. That's it. She signed it "Tahiti." When we come back, the first son says thank you to the man who stepped in front of a bullet that was meant for him. Kyle, what do you have to say to Mr. Gibson, now that it's over? It's not over. Not until Beth Ann comes home. REPORTER: Of course. Mr. Gibson, we've learned that the president has refused to pardon ex-CIA Director Widener. - What do you think about that? - FRANCIS: Um... That's none of my business. I just want to be here for Beth Ann. [phone ringing] [distorted voice] Francis, are you ready? Yes. I am. It's time to self-destruct. Hey, Secret Service... Hey. How you doing? DUNN: Beth Ann Gibson! Where is she? - Sold her. - To who? To the people that shot me. Shot Comm's here, too. Double-cross. [chuckles] - You believe that? - DUNN: Who has her? Is it Widener? KOZ: I don't know. No names in this business. Names get you dead. - What's your name? - Names get you dead. FINLEY: Help us find Beth Ann. Something happens to her, she ends up dead... I don't know your name, but I know you're no child killer. No, you're right, Secret Service, I'm not a child killer. But a kid got killed in that mansion, - and that's what I'm gonna go down for. - Don't you do it. You think the mansion was bad? Wait till you see what Gibson does to get his daughter back. Screw it... [gunshots] Worse than the kidnapping. Whatever Gibson is gonna do to get his daughter back is gonna be worse than the kidnapping. [music] I want to thank you for helping me make this happen, Kyle. Of course, Mr. Gibson. Anything for you. It was a big ask. So thanks. He's a parent, just like you. He should be here. Mr. President, there is a threat assessment on that man. He's a Ballard parent with a kidnapped kid. DEVORE: He's the man who saved my son's life on national television. I'll look like an ungrateful coward if I don't go out there and shake his hand. - Can you keep me safe? - Yes. We've been through this place a dozen times. We've searched both Gibsons from head to foot. PRINCIPAL: The President and First Lady of the United States. [distorted voice] You'll do something even you could not have imagined. sync & correction by f1nc0 ~ Addic7ed.com ~  www.tvsubtitles.net
