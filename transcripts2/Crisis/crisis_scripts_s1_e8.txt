 Crisis (2014): Season 1, Episode 8 - How Far Would You Go - full transcript 
 Dunn and Finley are being pulled in two directions simultaneously. Gibson is expecting them to turn over Clarenbach as per their deal. The CIA's Smith has taken Dunn's sister, Meg Fitch, prisoner and will kill her unless they turn Clarenbach over to him. They finally learn that Gibson is behind the kidnapping scheme. Dunn goes looking for her sister and turns to her boss for help. Finley takes Clarenbach to FBI headquarters and shows him some of the information they have. He recognizes the kidnap house from a drawing and knows where it is. He wants a deal before he reveals anything. Gibson meanwhile has contacted one of the parents, Jakob Vries, and sends him after Clarenbach.

 Previously on Crisis... If you took those kids to use their parents, - use us. - The CIA is holding a man at 836 North Humphrey Avenue. You are to get this man. You have exactly 3 hours to do this for me. You have good hands. - I'm not a good person. - I've met a lot worse lately. What you want those men to do for you is not science. Let me come to you, we can talk. You have those soldiers. That's what you want. - We only got one soldier in. - That should be more than enough.

 Everyone, stay down! There's no way out! We can't get out! Yeah, but-but they can't get in, either. What you should do, what both of you should do, is go back out the door you came through. That's not gonna happen. Clarenbach? I'm on my way to see your sister. And I got a dumpster all picked out for her when I'm through. So, why don't you just, uh, check and make sure that you didn't walk away with something that doesn't belong to you. 1x08 - "How Far Would You Go" I'm gonna call the FBI handlers outside Meg's house. - No one's answering. - Call your sister.

 This can't happen! My daughter... That's good. Fight! Get it all out. - No... - Hand me the phone. Meg, gtoour safe room now. Oh, it's a little late for that, sweetheart. I told you I'd take her, and I did. Now, you listen to me. You take Dr. Clarenbach to the intersection of Pennsylvania and K Street. Any sign of an FBI agent, any sign whatsoever, Meg dies. No! - Hey! - I know why Widener wants you. But I want to know why the kidnapper wants you! Why do you keep referring to him as the kidnapper? We all know the person who took those children is Francis Gibson. - What's our status? - Well, your daughter, that kid Ian and the first brat are barricaded in the wine cellar. They have a gun. Most of our surveillance cams are shot out. Death toll stands at six. Four ours, the bastard that killed them, - and your now worthless patsy. - You have a backup plan in your little book for this cluster? The plan was constructed to withstand catastrophic setbacks. And this is far from catastrophic. Open a line. I need a minute to make it secure. What are you doing? Those Feds, Finley and Dunn, have Clarenbach. - I still need him. - Why do you need him? You did what no one else could do. You took those kids. You got us rich. Maybe it's time to end this. Save the kids. Be a hero. Go home. No. I can't go home yet. We are in a war with Widener. And if I don't finish him, we're all dead. You, too, Koz. Rich, but dead. To destroy Widener, I still need Clarenbach. I have your secure line. These soldiers represent the global network of mercenaries Daddy has deployed all over the world. Right now they're launching a scorched Earth campaign. - You know what for? - To find Emma? That's right, Leo. To find your big sister. Then will the bad man take me? No. I would never let that happen. Then why'd you let them take Emma? Sir, you have a call. It came in on my personal cell phone. Mr. Vries, do you know who this is? I'm the one parent who's been waiting impatiently for your call. Tell me what you want done. Nothing that your mercenaries haven't done countless times overseas. For any foreign nation able to meet your price, you've whored out your men for snatch and grabs. In exchange for your daughter, you need to do one here. That's it? - You need to slip your FBI handlers. - That won't be a problem. sync & correction by f1nc0 ~ Addic7ed.com ~  - How do you know it's Gibson? - Because the kidnapper isn't targeting the CIA, they're going after Widener. - And Widener screwed Gibson. - How did Widener screw Gibson? The prog... the program we ran, there was a... a massacre. Widener put Gibson's name on it, and then he put a target on his daughter's heart to keep him quiet. Widener threatened to kill Gibson's daughter? Yeah. So it's personal. And I assume that's why Gibson wants me. To use me against Widener somehow. Okay, that's not gonna happen. We're gonna use you to get Gibson. We're gonna show you everything we have on the kidnapping, and you're gonna tell us exactly how Gibson is planning to use you. Who are his known associates? Who is helping him on the outside? How he is communicating with the parents. You're the key to Gibson. You are gonna open him up for us. He knows Gibson. This is the best shot we have of finding those kids. Yeah, all the information is on the secure server in the FBI. If we want to show him what we have on the kidnapping, we have to take him into the FBI. If Widener's people find out we took him into custody, they will kill Meg. Okay, you get him into the FBI. You show him everything we have on the kidnapping. - Just make sure no one sees you, okay? - I get him there? And what will you be doing? - I'm gonna get my sister. - Dunn? What happens when you show up to the exchange without Clarenbach? I think I have a plan. I am gonna need his clothes. - Are you sure about this? - She's my sister. I'm gonna get her. You use him to find Gibson. - He took his own daughter. - What? If it is Gibson, he took his own daughter. He had his finger cut off. And he made her watch. - Go, get me his clothes. - Then you get Meg, and I'll get Gibson. We need to get all the hostages together in one room until our in-house surveillance cams are back on-line. This is a big house, and we're blind. No, then they'll know how weak we are. Have your remaining men walk continuous rounds until our cameras are up and running. And what about your daughter? We breach the door, take the room? All right, easy or hard?! Last chance! - We have to open the door! - We cannot open the door! - You two go. - No. I shot their leader. I'm the one they want. Which is exactly why you cannot open the door, okay? They cut off my Dad's finger for trying to grab a gun. - They will kill you for what you did. - What I did was kill Hurst. Hurst! He was more of a father to me than my own Dad. And I killed him. I killed him with this gun. Maybe you should put the gun down, all right, Kyle? Hey, why'd the pounding stop? - What are they gonna do now? - I don't know. No. We don't breach. I won't risk that. Leave them there, start your rounds. We start at the top. Work our way down. And do it again. When do I get surveillance back in the room where my daughter is? We don't. We didn't put cameras in that part of the house. Whoever attacked this place must've hit them hard. If we're ever gonna get out of here, this is our chance. - Oh, my God. - It's okay, it's okay. - They lost four of their own. - We need to search them. Those gunmen, they all had radios. Maybe they left one on a body. - We need to search them. - That's smart. Sir? We have a possible situation with one of the parents. The handlers sitting on the Fitch residence haven't checked in, they aren't responding to my calls. Get SWAT and HRT to the Fitch residence. We have a possible parent mission in play. The second anyone has eyes on Meg Fitch, I'm to be informed. Agent Dunn hasn't checked in? No, sir. But the Secret Service agent she was working with just used his keycard to swipe into the building 7 minutes ago. - Finley and not Dunn? - That's right, sir. Just Finley. - Find him and bring him to me. - Yes, sir. These are the parents Gibson has used so far. Is there a pattern here that we're missing? Uh, no. Uh, I don't see one. These are the targets he's gone after. Well, they're all Widener-related, but you know - that already... - Look again. Look at this, and tell me what you see. This is a massive amount of information. These are the two soldiers we took out of the Pakistani Embassy. Yes, Thayer and Hawkins. They're part of the program. - Widener's hit team. - Where are they now? Last time I saw them, Widener was going to let Gibson take them. Why would Widener want that? So that they would kill Gibson. Sir? Agent Finley's logged into the kidnapping database. - From where? - One second, and I can tell you. If Gibson was attacked, he could be weak. Even weak, he's smarter than you. No, wait. Go back a screen. Yeah. I know that. Got him. He's in the server room. - Go invite Agent Finley up here. - Yes, sir. This place? This is where Gibson's holding the children? Based on the recollection of the released kids. You recognize it? Yeah, I was there once with Gibson. He's smart. You'll never find it. - Where is it? - Well... now we need to discuss a deal. You want Witness Protection, - I can give you that... - You must be joking. Widener would find me in Witness Protection. No. You turn your back on me and let me walk, I'll show you where this place is and I'll take care of myself. Look again. Be sure. You know where this place is? Yes, Agent Finley. And I can take you there. Let's go. There's nothing. No radios, no keys, no weapons on any of them. - Nothing. - Aaron... look. Amber, this is an exterior wall. This door leads outside. I'm not coming back from this. By the end of the day I'll either be dead or in jail. The government will come after my business. Make sure everything is signed over to my wife. Sorry, Mr. Vries. Afraid we can't let you out of our sight. Ah, my FBI handlers. Did you know I was assigned more handlers than any other parent? I assaulted federal agents. I'm prepared to do much worse. I'll take full responsibility. You had nothing to do with this, sir. Your men will swear to it. These men would die for you. Let's go get your daughter. Okay... Where the hell have you been? - Please, sir, just listen... - No, you listen to me. Since you've gone off the grid, four agents on Jakob Vries were found unconscious and the two on your sister are in the wind. As are Vries and your sister. I would have told this to your partner, but he blew through here without checking in. I need your help or my sister Meg dies. If your sister is on a parent mission and you're asking me to facilitate it... It's not the kidnapper who has her, sir. It's the kidnapper's target. Widener has her. Widener... - What do you need? - I'm an FBI agent. I need the FBI. You plan to take the mansion by yourself? No, I'll call plenty of backup when we get there. These are to make sure we do get there. Lots of people want you. Gibson, Widener... they're not going to wait for me to turn you over. They will come after us. You know how to use one of these? The open end points away from you? - Am I still heading this way? - Toward 95 North. Bolted solid. Must be some kind of security door. - We need a key. - I know where we are. Fort Hovings. United States Army. - We're in an Army base? - Out of service and abandoned. Decommissioned three years ago. This was the base commander's house. - Why would they put us here? - Because it's 300 deserted square acres surrounded by barbed wire and "keep out" signs. We're never getting out. Yes, we are. I have an idea. Boss, I can't get the geo-locator back online. I can't track Agent Finley's phone. Open a phone line. - Do you have the coordinates? - I need you to track the target. What has happened to the data you promised me? Do you have a problem? No problem. The FBI is now looking for you. Find Clarenbach before the FBI finds you or you'll be in jail for your daughter's funeral. - - You get your sister? - No, not yet. But Finley, listen... I know which parent Gibson is sending after you to get Clarenbach. - It's Jakob Vries. - Red Iron. - Military contractor. - Yeah, the guy's got an army. Finley, listen, if you want to come into the FBI for protection, - I'll understand. - I'll keep heading this way. Vries is coming for you. I can only imagine what he'll bring to get his daughter back. Go get Meg. I'll get the kids. You want to track anything on the road, you use the taxi network. One of them spotted Clarenbach and Agent Finley headed towards Maryland. We've got him. All agents are in place and ready for the exchange, - Agent Dunn. - All right, come and get him. We a go? Keep your face down. You don't look that much like him. Are you seeing this? No, I don't think he's Widener's. But if Widener's men think he's FBI, Meg is dead. Hold your position. - Sir, I'm sorry, you can't be here. - What about my money? I don't have any cash on me. - You're supposed to give me $100. - For what? Who told you to come talk to me? He said you'd give me $100, I give you... Hold your position. Do not fire. - He's not armed. Hold your fire. - ...this. Who gave you this? Where is the person that gave you this? - Meg... - Move! Now! Go, go, go! It's not your sister. I know where she is. If you want to see her, come with me now. How did he lie to me? Hurst. Every day, I saw him. I know his wife. I know his little girl, Tory. - Kyle... - She's just eight. But I saw him aim that gun at your dad. I saw him shoot Finley. - I saw it, too. We all did. - His little girl... What am I supposed say to her if I get out of here? - I'm the guy that killed her dad. - No, no... Should've killed more of them. Should've killed 'em all. Hey, there's something back here. Oh, my God, it's a phone. Where the hell's the key pad? It's just an old intercom system, for the servants. - Usually only goes to the kitchen. - That's where the kidnappers are. Agent Finley is a trained Secret Service agent. - When attacked, he will fight back. - No need to tell me my job. He will return fire, he will drive evasively. Moving cars and bullets may endanger Clarenbach. You need to take care that he's not injured. I need Clarenbach alive. If he dies, so does yo daughter. If anything happens to my Emma, I will kill you with my hands. Anger is good. Anger can be focused. Focus yours. Give me your heading. Traveling North, currently cutting through the town of Oxon Hill. They're heading this way. I heard him say "Finley." - Maybe he's looking for us. - Yeah. Maybe he's close. If Gibson wants to use me, it's either 'cause of what I know... and that-that can put Widener away for life... or it's 'cause of what I can do. Now, I make the drug that makes those soldiers kill. But if Gibson wants to use the drug, then he's gonna need soldiers from the program. You can't just inject anybody and expect them to kill. It took us months to get enough pharmaceutical inside their bodies to elicit the correct reaction. - Do you think that's what he wants? - Stop talking. I'm trying to help. And I'm telling you to shut your mouth. Now. That's a helicopter. They're using a bloody helicopter to track us. It's Vries' army. It's Red Iron. And he's a parent. This is Little Bird One. We are over target. Target is moving at speed and appears to be armed. I'm going to stop the car. - We're getting out. - Are you mad? There's a helicopter, most probably armed, above us. Was a cop for three years. The only people who get away when they're being chased by a chopper are the people who get out of the car. Here we go. Lost them. Say again. They have left the car and are traveling on foot, 28 degrees North of you. Let's go hunting. The phone is secure. Go ahead.  Have you heard from that soldier that got to where Gibson is? No, but we can assume he inflicted optimal damage. The fact that you haven't heard from him... presumed dead? Yes. Remember, the primary target was Gibson. - Gibson could be dead, too. - What about our other problem? Have you found Clarenbach? I'm working on that right now. Where's her cell phone? In the trash with her badge and gun. Chain her up. What the hell were you thinking, coming here? You should be trying to save Amber, not me. The plan was to do both. Now you call for backup, right? We're gonna get to safer ground, then I'll call my partner. If her sister's safe, I'll call for backup. But right now, you're gonna tell me where those kids are at... right now! If I do, you won't need me at all! I'm sorry, I am. No, I need to be somewhere safe first. Very safe. - And you need to get me there. - Come on. Agent Dunn, really great to see you. I've got a question for you. - Where's Dr. Clarenbach? - Screw you. - Meg. - I'm okay. - I'm good. - Next time it's my fist. You want to see Clarenbach so badly, why don't you... tell your boss, Widener, to come down and get his hands dirty? No, no, no, no, I'm the one with the dirty hands. As for you, I know your partner has Clarenbach. Why don't you just tell me where he is? Clarenbach knows about the kidnappers. He can help us find Amber. I can't give him up. Why don't you tell him what you told him last time, Suze. - Go on, tell him. - Screw you! Meg! I will kill you. Do you understand? I will put my gun down your throat, and I will kill you! She really looks up to you. I can see that. So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna get a knife, and I'm gonna cut into your little sister until you tell her it's okay to talk to me. This is a tough way to get you to spend time with me. I'm gonna get you out of here. I don't think so, Suze. So Jonas knows how to get the kids back? So we got to hang tough. The Dunn sisters, huh? The Dunn sisters. They're doing vertical searches through each building. But what I can see, they're only six of them. "Only"? There are only two of us, and I really wouldn't count me. Meg, I want you to promise me. Close your eyes. When it happens, close your eyes and think of Amber. - The Simmons house. - What? When we were kids, you were scared of that house on the corner, the creepy house. I used to tell you to close your eyes every time we walked by. And when we'd walk by, you'd hold my hand. Except that one time. I told you we were past when we weren't. I remember. I'm sorry. It's okay. You could've raised her, Susie. I know I told you that you couldn't, but... you're strong, and you're good. You could've raised her. Oh, god... You close your eyes until we're past, yeah? - Well, are we ready? - Just shut up and get it over with. That's what I thought. That's why it's going into Meg instead. Stop! Stop! No, God, I'll do it! I'll do it! Give me the phone. Give me the phone! You have to call for backup. Not until my partner's sister is safe. - Hello? - Finley, it's me. - Where are you, Dunn? - Finley, I-I need you to bring him here. - Bring Clarenbach here. - What? We can't turn him over. - Dunn, what happened? - Finley, listen to me, okay? It's bad, all right? It's real bad. It's real bad, Finley. - Okay, is the old man there? - Yeah. Put him on. - Agent Finley. - I'm willing to give you Clarenbach. - What? - But you're gonna have to come get him. The kidnapper sent a parent mission to get Clarenbach. If you want him, you better come quick. Burnt-out industrial building on 6th and Roosevelt in Oxon Hill. - You just gave me up! - I just bought my partner some time and hopefully pitted two people that want you so badly against each other. Now, come on. We got to keep moving. - Gibson is still operational. - How do we know this? Because he's using the Ballard parents to find the same man we're looking for. Clarenbach is crucial to the pharmaceutical side of this. Two years and $200 million if we want to redevelop it. - You cannot let Gibson get him. - I wasn't planning to. - They're leaving. - They'll be back. Whatever Finley said led the old man and a few of them away, okay? - All right. - I was gonna get him, Susie. Gibson. I was gonna take his money. I was gonna track it and take it. He may be run by ideas, but I imagine that everyone that works for him wants to be paid. I was gonna get him, Susie. You still don't think we're getting out of here, huh? Meg, what's it say in that book of yours? What's it say in that book of yours about-about negative thoughts? - I come out against them. - That's right. Yes, I read your book. Mr. Vries, Agent Finley is one man. It's unclear to me why you cannot take Clarenbach from him. I'm becoming concerned for the welfare of your daughter. Be quiet. You need to see this. I snaked an optical cord into the air vent to monitor them. - What are they listening to? - Us. All right, now after I go, you count to 30, and then you go up to your room. - And you? - I'm gonna get close enough to one of them to get the keys and the radio. - And then I'm out the door. - Aaron... If I get far enough away from here, the government must be listening. If I can get a signal out, I can get you home. Okay? I knew I heard something. - Amber, run! - No! Run! Amber, run! I'll hold him. Go! Go. No... I'll hold him. Aaron. Aaron? No. I'll draw them away. When I do, you need to run out that exit. Don't stop, don't look back. - Run to where? - Back to the car. PD will have responded to the shooting by then. - What shooting? - The shooting that's about to start. Agent Finley! We have a problem. I'm a man that's willing to kill for my daughter, and you, the Secret Service Agent are trained to take a bullet. I've accepted the fact that I'm going to prison today. And I'd like very much not to have to kill a good man on my last day of freedom. I just need Clarenbach. It's the only way I get my daughter back. The kidnapper will kill my Emma if I don't bring him Clarenbach. Please, just give him to me. You make it back, you tell those cops where that mansion is. - Okay, I will. - Jakob, listen to me. You don't have to do this. We know how to get to the mansion. We can rescue all those kids. Nobody has to get hurt. Even if you're telling the truth, you can't guarantee that I get my little girl back alive. The only thing that guarantees it is if I do what the kidnapper wants. All he wants is Clarenbach. All I want is Emma. Listen to me. This is where the killing starts. Use lethal force on the agent. Make sure you get Clarenbach alive. You want to live, you need to keep thinking. You want to keep thinking, you need to keep breathing. There will be shooting. Got it? When I start shooting, you run. - Ready? - Ready. One... two... He said not to kill me. Why are they shooting at me? They're not. They're shooting at the second set of gunmen who came to get you. Widener's men. This is our only chance to get out. The parent mission that wasn't supposed to be a problem? It's Jakob Vries. It's a huge problem. Then you need to make the problem go away. - I need Clarenbach. - Gotcha. Come here. Kill everyone: Finley, Vries, his men. Everyone except Clarenbach. Widener needs him alive. - What is that? - It's gas. He's using gas. I'm sorry, I really am, but it's my daughter. No, wait. Wait. He knows where the mansion is. No matter what you do to me, you have to ask him. You dislocated your thumb to get out of your cuffs. Yeah, I guess all those years of hurting myself finally paid off, huh? Sorry. - Hey, let's get you out of here. - What do you mean, get me out of here? - What about you? - Gibson's the target. That means they're after him, too. They could have information that could lead us to Amber. - I need to see if they do. - I can't leave you here, Susie. For once in your life, you're not in control. - Susie... - You'll just slow me down. I can't worry about you with what I have to do. Come with me. Damn it. Just stay here. What's going on here? Where's the other girl? Behind you! Put the gun down. I am real tired of you people telling me what to do. You've got blood on your face. It's not mine. Let's go. That's not gonna happen. Lets get you back up to your room. The FBI has now confirmed that the woman found hanging beneath the 15th Street bridge was one of their own, Special Agent Keegan. At the time of her death, Agent Keegan was assigned to Ballard parent, Meg Fitch. Sir, Agent Finley has been located. He's safe. - We've sent agents to bring him in. - What about Agent Dunn? - She wasn't with him. - Get Agent Finley on the line. Olsen. I'm in a building on the corner of 58th and Jackson. Send a full team. Emma? - Emma?! - Dad? - Emma! - Dad... Get down! Get down on the ground. Step away, sir. Emma! If you're just joining us, another Ballard student, Emma Vries, has been released. She's the eighth student since the kidnapping to be released. The FBI has now confirmed that the woman found hanging - beneath the 15th Street bridge... - The Fitch girl? She'll have a story to tell. - Unharmed? - Not a scratch. - You know how important she is. - I do. That teacher must have put up a hell of a fight. I didn't think he had it in him. - What about them? - Roll some gas down the vent. Tuck 'em back in their beds. There's been enough punishment for one day. Authorities won't comment on what her father may have done to procure her freedom, but Jakob Vries is in FBI custody at this time. - Francis. - Jonas. - I've been here before. - Yes. We both have. Now... are you ready to get to work? You saved both of our lives by pulling the old man away. Looks like you did the lifesaving around here. They killed two FBI agents, - hung one of their bodies off a bridge. - Yeah, I know. And Gibson, he got Clarenbach? But I know the direction the mansion is in. It's a tank of gas from here. We're close, Dunn. Real close. sync & correction by f1nc0 ~ Addic7ed.com ~  www.tvsubtitles.net
