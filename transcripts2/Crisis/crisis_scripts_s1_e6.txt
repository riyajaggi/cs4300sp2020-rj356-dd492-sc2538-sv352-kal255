 Previously on Crisis... Taking me and these two patients is kidnapping. - Anything on Clarenbach yet? - No, nothing. Keep listening. It'd be an awful lot easier if you'd stop shaking the board. And before you tell me the kids are the ones doing all the shaking, let me just point out some facts. Nothing but a tiny little piece has lost its way. You gotta help me. Help me stay awake. I dreamed of those people. They're gonna make me kill again. - Who is? - He is.

 COMM: Enemy neutralized. The soldiers are secure. We need to figure out what Gibson has to do with those soldiers. - Do you want to trust me? - Yeah. [fire alarm chirping] Who's responsible for this? - It was me. - Punishment begins tomorrow morning at 6:00 AM. This guy is better than us. Smarter than us. If he wants to send a kid home in a bag, there's nothing we can do about it. - What is he doing? - FINLEY: Let's ask him. [phone ringing] 1x07 - Homecoming [phone ringing] - Boss, you sure about this? - When they pick up that phone, you just keep bouncing the signal. [line ringing]

 [phone ringing] Agent Dunn. You have 30 seconds. [stopwatch ticking] What do you know about the head squad? There's evidence they work here. In this country. Yeah, I saw that storage unit too. Tell me something I don't know. 25 seconds. What do we get if we do? Well, you get to keep me on the phone. Isn't that what you want? To get inside my head? 20 seconds. CIA Director Widener, we know he's involved. Tell me something I don't know. Francis Gibson. What about him? We know he's involved. He's ex-CIA. Yes. We asked him about that. Several times. Now he's in the other room crying with his daughter. Ten seconds. If you took those kids to use their parents... use us. We can help you. Five seconds. Station Orange CO239GH. Where did you hear that code? Which time? He heard the broadcast from two locations. We can triangulate the signal and get a fix on Station Orange. I assume the first time you heard that code was in the basement of the Pakistani Embassy three days ago. At what other time and place did you hear it? We can work together. Not without the where and when. Good-bye. Ground floor of a building at 227 H Street. 38 hours ago. You want to work together? Use you instead of the parents? You will do something for me. If you succeed, I will release a hostage. If you fail, a hostage dies. I will call you again in four hours. If you tell anyone, you've already failed. sync & correction by n17t01 & f1nc0 ~ Addic7ed.com ~ Wakie, wakie, wakie! It is 6:00 a.m. and you are on the clock. Now! [high-pitched, steady ringing] Four lines. Arms width apart! Four lines! Now! Read it. "My father is the President of the United States. He is the most powerful man alive and he cannot find me. He cannot save me. If these men wanted to kill me, my father could not stop them." Read it again. "My father is the President of the United States... "My father commands an aircraft carrier battle group with thousands of sailors and Marines. My father cannot find me. My father cannot save me...." "My father represents the People's Republic of China. My father cannot find me. My father cannot save me..." "Through insider trading my father has amassed a fortune. He has paid off judges and politicians to stay out of jail." My father cannot find me. My father cannot save me. If these men wanted to kill me, my father could not stop them..." "My mother cannot find me. My mother cannot save me..." "My parents cannot find me. My parents cannot save me..." "My mother cannot find me. My mother cannot save me..." [all reading] How long will you make them do that? Until they believe it. [all reading] I don't think your daughter ever will. Believe that you can't help her. I've seen the way she looks at you now. That's what you wanted, right? Where are you with triangulating those signals - Agent Finley gave us? - Nearly there. - Where is that? - That the signal we got from that location. {*} Lock on that signal. That's it. That's Station Orange. Can you open it up? COMM: We're in. I cut trackers out of them both. Then we're good to go. FBI and military bands are chatter-free. No eyes in the sky, either. - Hawkins goes with you. - How you doing, Hawkins? Quiet type, I guess. You take him and this file to this news station. And then you get out of there. Thayer goes with me back to Gibson. You're going on the news, Sergeant Hawkins. You're gonna be famous. FINLEY: If we tell Olsen, and he shuts us down, a kid dies. - You believe he'd kill a kid? - I have no reason not to. And when the next call comes in and he tells us what he wants us to do... where do we draw the line? The more we do for the kidnappers, the more we find out about them. I understand how we have to tell ourselves that so we're not just two more par... people... two more people doing what that voice on the phone tells them to do. But it's true. Everything they tell us to do reveals - a little more about who they are. - But that's not what I asked. What I asked was "What would we be willing to do?" - Where's the line, Finley? - "The line"? We keep going until one of us says stop, okay? Okay. How much time until the next call? A little over three hours. Nine deaths, all in the last 18 months. Two shootings unsolved. The rest... car wrecks, fire, drowning, falls. - The kidnapper led you here. - Agent Dunn? - Agent Dunn? - Uh, y-y-yes. We discovered this while...  [clears throat] ...attempting to trap the kidnappers. I understand that the kidnapper, who you lost, led you here. But what does this have to do with the CIA? FINLEY: That one. He was on that video I saw at the CIA. He and his family were massacred by those soldiers. That video you saw for maybe 10, 15 seconds? He was on that video, sir. A parent died getting it out of the CIA for the kidnapper. - I know what I saw. - And I see a lot of you two lately. Aren't you assigned to the parents? OLSEN: They are. But their investigations led them to the storage unit and this information. What of the parents? They're all buttoned up? We don't have to worry about the kidnapper using them to launch any more attacks? Yes, sir, the parents are all  "buttoned up." COMM: Station Orange code is heavily encrypted. So far I'm only into today's mission file and just barely. Filter a search for "Clarenbach" or "chemist." Nothing on "Clarenbach," but keyword "chemist" - pings back to an address out in Anacostia. - Good, good. Open a line out for me to Special Agent Dunn. These are the Feds. We're talking directly to them now. No, now I am talking directly to you. And I'm telling you to open a line. Opening a line now. Use that code to figure out whatever else Widener's hiding. Even bouncing it, I can only guarantee 15 seconds considering where they are. Do it. Nine deaths, all in last 18 months... two shootings on... [cell phone ringing] OLSEN: I need to see that tape. It's turned up twice in relation to this kidnapping. My agency is doing everything in its power to trace our connection to that kidnapping, but I cannot show you that tape. Agent Dunn? I'm just checking on the parents, sir. FRANCIS: The CIA is holding a man at 836 North Humphrey Avenue. You are to get this man and bring him to the East Capitol Street parking garage, fifth floor, green section. You have exactly three hours to do this for me. What will you do to him? Now you have less than three hours. [phone beeps] Hey, Susie Cakes.  I'll meet you in the car. - Want help with this? - No, I got it. What are you doing here? Well, my daughter's been kidnapped. Her mom is a Fed. I'm just a concerned parent. You look great. - Why did we ever split up? - How much do you want? This time? More than you can afford. This time you're gonna have to ask your sister for some help. You look busy. I'll be in touch. FINLEY: They must be someone important beeing held in there. DUNN: Female, mid-30s. - You see what's in that bag? - Yeah, looks like takeout. Male, mid-30s, a sidearm under his coat. Finley, they look like Feds to you? Yeah. I'm guessing the kind that work out at Langley. How much time do we have left? - You get the sandwiches he wanted? - Yes, I got the sandwiches he wanted. - Is he still in the basement? - No, I'm taking a break. Oh, excellent. I'm starving. - Look what the guards forgot. - Put it out to speakers. {*} - Should we? - Yeah. [music plays] It's homecoming, bitches! Put your hands up! ♪ And you know what it is, and you know what it is ♪ ♪ And you know what it is, and you know what it is... ♪ Where is it?! - What are you doing? - It's all good. - Are you high? - Shh. It's just music. You remember music, right? ♪ Tip the bartender, then you know I'm headed to the floor ♪ ♪ DJ playin' T.I.P., I like my beat down... ♪ Hold it. Give 'em 30 minutes. Then shut it down and line them up again. And send two men to the service entrance. Koz is back. ♪ Yeah, I knew it, baby, love it or hate it... ♪ It's homecoming, bitches. That charmer back at HQ, that's Amber's father? Yeah. I'm not thinking about him today and neither should you. You want help with him, just ask. - Not thinking about him today. - Understood. [siren wails] - Hey... - Hey. Gas leak? Yeah. Can't you smell it? This whole block could go. We got a gas leak, guys. Class presidente. You don't want to dance with me, trust me. ♪ I'm in the Milky Way ♪ ♪ You want me down on Earth, but I am up in space ♪ ♪ You're so damn hard to please ♪ ♪ We gotta kill this switch ♪ ♪ You're from the '70s, but I'm a '90s chick ♪ ♪ I love it... ♪ He's the president's son. Do you even get the time of day from him when we're not in this place? It's probably just the Stockholm syndrome. I think that's where you identify with the kidnappers. I'm just saying you need to be a little more realistic. - Aw, Zoe. Yeah? - Stay... away... from me. ♪ I threw your stuff into a bag ♪ ♪ And pushed it down the stairs. ♪ - What about our friend downstairs? - Oh, he's not hungry. [siren wails outside] Hey, what's that sound? The fire department is evacuating. - Is there a fire? - No, sir. But our surveillance cameras show it's the entire block. Okay, get ready to clean up downstairs. Fire Department! Is anyone here? We're here for a gas leak. We're advising you that we'll be breaching this door due to public safety. - Wha-What's going on? - Tracking down a gas leak. - Are you alone in the house? - Yes, I am. We'll have to ask you to step outside - while we check for gas. - I'll just be a minute. We need to come in now. TJS: Let them in. I thought you said you were alone. My son is very protective of my privacy. - So, it looks like we have a gas leak, huh? - We're going to have to check your house. You are the owner here? Oh, I'm the owner, yeah. And you're with the fire department? - And yet you're not in uniform. - We got called in. We need you and anyone else here out of the house for your own safety. Well, I can assure you it's not coming from here. I'm very particular about my maintenance. So you can just mark this house off your list and move on. I'm afraid we can't do that. We have to check the whole block. [footsteps approach] - It's my daughter-in-law. - She'll have to leave as well. Just until we know it's safe. Do you know where you are, son? - I think so. - You think so. Well, if you think you know where you are, what you should do, what both of you should do is go back out the door you came through. - For your own safety. - That's not gonna happen. [door lock clicks] [siren blips] D.C. Metro. They're here to help with the evacuation. See, sometimes we get a stubborn homeowner, and you gotta pry him out of the house. You are the homeowner here, right? We'll step out. We'll step out because we don't want to get in anybody's way. We don't want to step on anybody's toes. Cara, let's go. Did you get that mess cleaned up? No. [pop music playing] You're making a real habit of finding me looking my worst. Guess so. Are you pissed at me for ruining your escape plan? Beth Ann, what happened with you and Zoe? I said something I should say to you. Stay away from me. I get it, okay?  If we get out of here, you're gonna go back to being you, and I'm gonna go back to being the tuition relief girl. You're the only good thing in my life. [slow music plays] - Seriously? - Just pretend like we're somewhere else. - Nobody can see us. - I can see us. My Mom, she made me get dance lessons for Dad's inauguration. I'm good. Dad's inauguration? Do you even realize how obnoxious that sounds? ♪ I just wanted you to know ♪ ♪ That, baby, you're the best ♪ ♪ I got my red dress on tonight ♪ ♪ Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight ♪ Evasion route took longer than I expected, but we weren't followed. You weren't. I would have known. Hope he's worth all this. He's a weapon. I'm gonna use him against Widener. - Finley... - Clear. Oh! Clarenbach? Dennis. Nice to see you. It's me, Francis. You'll be staying here with us for a little while. COMM: Boss... I'm deeper into today's file for Station Orange. Something here about the soldiers. - What's it say? - Decrypting now. They've been given the advanced protocol. No, wait, not "given..." injected with the advanced protocol and they are currently deployed on a mission. - What kind of mission? - Thayer? Hostage rescue. Gah! Gun! [gunfire] Hey! Down! Everyone stay down! Ian, get down! - BETH ANN: Is it a rescue? - I don't know. [gunfire] KOZ: Are you hit? No! Find him! Take him out. No, no! We need him alive. - Widener set us up. - He must be dead. He wanted us to bring Hawkins and Thayer back here. Cut the phone lines. He calls in our position, we're dead. Have we heard anything on Hawkins? [phone ringing] Guess I'm not gonna be famous. [ringing continues] - Let's go. - Look, I just want you to know I didn't want to hurt you when you took those soldiers. - When you drugged us? - You being in a semi-conscious state is what convinced them not to kill you. In essence, I saved your life. - How much time do we have left? - Uh, about 30 minutes. - Time left until what? - Come on, we're leaving. No, I can't, I can't. I don't think you really have a choice. Let's go! You don't understand.  I want to. Given the options, you're a far better choice, but there are people - upstairs, savage people... - They left and now we're leaving. [music] He's loose inside the house. - Where's my surveillance video? - Working on it. Go, I'm okay. Go. If I need to pick that up,  we're all in trouble. - Koz!. - I know. - Alive. - I know. [music] [music shuts off] [distant gunfire] [indistinct radio chatter] Those cops and firemen that showed up for you back there. They came... why? Because you asked for them? I guess because they know I'd show up for them. [distant gunshots] There you are. Get up. Please. I understand now. You don't want your friends to know about us. Close your eyes. P-P-Please. Don't, don't... No peeking. Okay. You can look now. Stay here. When it's safe... ...I'll come back for you. [distant gunfire] [grunts] Secret Service. Don't shoot. We have a problem. What is it? Site's been compromised. Federal agents. I'll have their IDs very soon. And our friend in the basement? Well, he left with the agents before I could get what I needed. He was tougher than I thought. But don't worry, Gabe. I'll get him back. How did they find you? Well, they must have triangulated the signal and hacked in. But they only got as deep as today's mission. I'll scrub it. - How is today's mission? - We only got one soldier in. That should be more than enough. - How much time do we have? - 25 minutes. This isn't a rescue mission, is it? It is a rescue mission. It's just not yours. DUNN: Those people who were torturing you... don't you work for them? Why were they torturing you? What happens when your timer gets to zero? Somehow, I feel it involves me. - Finley, turn the car around. - Okay! I work for them. The CIA? You work for the CIA? I thought... I thought I did. But I found out I just work for Widener. - Widener runs the CIA. - Mmm... But this thing he's doing... it's not CIA sanctioned. FINLEY: We got a tail. - You see who it is? - No. Please, you cannot let them take me. Why were they torturing you? Widener does it with those soldiers. It doesn't work without me. FINLEY: They're still back there. - How much time? - Less than 20. Please stop asking about the time. It makes me fear for my well-being. What we did to those soldiers... When they're under the influence of a... a pharmaceutical, they have no moral compass at all. You can instruct them to do anything. Without fear. Without hesitation. Then Widener's hit squad's here. {*} - Why does Widener need you? - Because I'm the only one who knows the formula. - And I'm the only one who knows how that works. - Here he comes. Now, please... tell me what happens when your timer gets to zero. THAYER: Come out. - Kyle Devore. - Yes? - Beth Ann Gibson. - Are you here to rescue us? [gunshot] He left us? He left us. What are you doing? Kyle, don't. Don't. [siren blaring] - Finley? - I can't lose him. What are you gonna do? Leave him here. Buckle up. [tires screech] [tires screech] [gunfire] [clicking] You're out, Thayer. Toss your weapon. And come out real slow. You wanna get to our radio, you need to come thru us. That's the plan. [grunts] How could he keep coming like that? I don't know. [radio crackles] The building is secure. We got him. Shooting is over. Everyone assemble in the main room. Don't make us come looking for you. Shooting is over. Everyone assemble in the main room. Don't make us come looking for you. - Thayer is down. - What do you mean he's down? What's the matter, Mr. Gibson? Things not going your way? Put it down. Think about your daughter. - Think about Tory. - I am. You're gonna release Tory and the rest of these kids. And I'll put you down, you sick son of a bitch! [tires screech] - Time. - We're good. - Any moment now. - No contact ahead. But I'll check those vehicles. You're turning me over to the kidnappers, aren't you? [car door shuts] - Amber? Are you okay? - Yeah. Where's Kyle Devore? Call him. Kyle! Where are you?! - Kyle! - HURST: Now spread your feet a little wider. Good. - Both eyes open? - Open and focused on the sight. Let the weapon do all the work. Just aim center mass. And lightly squeeze the trigger back. Hurst! [gunshot] [grunts] You had to do it. Give me the gun now, Kyle. Give me the gun. [gun cocks] [footsteps nearby] - Just... get back! - Please! Please, don't hurt him! - Put the gun down, kid. - Do what he says. They won't shoot the President's son. Let's all just take a breath. And think this through. - Run. - Let's go! Go! - What are we going to do now? - Well, they can't get out. I'm talking about Hurst. Our fall guy's dead! Thayer took out half our people. Calm down. - We should evacuate. - No. - If he compromised our position... - If he had, we'd be dead now. This is still the safest place to be. So, please just... find my daughter. [music] We said we'd keep going until one of us said stop. So, are you saying it now? Come on, come on! [man yells] - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Help me! [all grunting] There's no way out! We can't get out! Yeah, but-but they can't get in, either. - I killed Hurst. - No, no, no. You had to, okay? You had to, you had to save my dad. Kyle, look at me. You-you saved my father. Do you have what I asked for? Yeah, we have him. Expect another call. I will let you know when and how I will collect him. Please tell me which hostage you would like released. I assume it's the niece or the, uh, protectee. Which one? Or shall I choose for you? Are you sure about this? He's about control. We need to take some of it back. Finley, if this is our one shot with him, then we take it. Yeah, about that. We're going to renegotiate. I don't think you understand. I think we do. What we have is what you need. It's what Widener needs. So what we need is a better offer. One hostage isn't enough. We're going to need all of them. What's going to happen to me? [phone ringing] That didn't take long. Hello. - TJS: Is this Agent Susan Dunn? - Yes, who is this? We met earlier today. You might remember. I've lost something and perhaps, uh, you picked it up accidentally. And if you did, I was hoping you'd be a sweetheart and give it back to me. - Why would I do that? - Because I'm on my way to see your sister. And I've got a dumpster all picked out for her when I'm through. So, why don't you just, uh, check and make sure that you didn't walk away with something that doesn't belong to you. sync & correction by n17t01 & f1nc0 ~ Addic7ed.com ~
