 Mr Selfridge (2013–2016): Season 2, Episode 3 - Episode #2.3 - full transcript 
 The store is preparing for the Empire Exhibition but Agnes is struggling with her display and Thackeray is not pleased when Harry reinstates Henri, who has offered to help her. Nor is Rose happy to find Gordon has some saucy photos but in the resultant confrontation he makes her see that she should give Harry another chance. Consequently she declines her husband's suggestion that she should return to America if there is a war and they agree to support each other. Kitty gives Frank another chance as they take a picnic to Green park whilst Grove reencounters Miss Mardle who, thanks to a legacy, is now a woman of property, making him regret his not marrying her. Lady Mae learns that Loxley has huge gambling debts and threatens to expose this should he ever lay a finger on her again and, following the success of Agnes and Henri's impressive display, Loxley offers to invite Winston Churchill to open the exhibition. However Harry must inform the staff that Churchill cannot come as Britain is now at war with Germany, following the latter's invasion of Belgium. Ignorant of the carnage to come, the people sing 'Rule Britannia' at Delphine's club.

 (plants rustling) (man hawking newspapers) Read all about it! My brother says he wants to join the Cavalry. JESSIE: Their uniforms are ever so smart. You'd look nice in one, Franco. You won't catch me getting on a horse. What's wrong with using your legs? Nothing, if they look like yours. Ah… I've been looking for you.

 Come on. We need to do the menus for next week. Sorry, I forgot. You could help me out a bit more, Franco. I'm busy enough as it is. This Empire Exhibition's the last thing I need. Not very patriotic of you, Mr. Colleano. But of course you're Italian, so why should you care? Don't take any notice of her. She's not the first one to say it. Has any post arrived for me, Miss Plunkett? I'm expecting a parcel. Nothing for you in the first post, Mr. Crabb. Have you seen Mr. Grove yet this morning?

 Does anyone ever see Mr. Grove? (door opens) MAN: Good morning, Mr. Selfridge. Good morning. Can I ask, Mr. Selfridge, what did Mr. Ridley want? Our financial position is strong. According to Mr. Ridley, if there is a war, nobody will shop. I disagree and told him so. How are preparations for next week going? We've taken out a great deal of advertising. That's good. Empire Week needs to run like clockwork. I presume Mr. Grove knows that? I'm sure Mr. Grove is aware of the situation, chief. He's not even here, is he? What's wrong with this man? What is it? Do you think, sir, we're going to fight the Germans? Is that what you think? Why should I tell you if I did? All she wants is a little reassurance. I know. So why not give it to her? Because it's much more amusing not to. Where are you going? Out. Where to? Anywhere. Away from you. (chuckles) (sighs) (whistling) (talking quietly) What have you got there? Those are pretty racy! Wouldn't mind a bit of that, eh? None of us would. What's going on? Uh… nothing. AGNES: Then around the store there will be several themed Empire displays. Fine. I've set one up as an example so that you can see what I'm trying to achieve. In Fashion, We're representing the Raj, SO… Good morning, Mr. Selfridge. Mr. Thackeray. Where's my display? I spent half the night putting it up. Your display? Oh, my dear Miss Towler, I had no idea. But I told you… When I arrived this morning, there was this drab little motif at the center of my department. I thought I should get rid of it before the customers arrived. It wasn't finished. But I could always put it back. It's a bit late for that. I suggest this stay and we find another place for the Raj, the Palm Court perhaps? I'm sure that Mr. Colleano will oblige. VICTOR: I'm not having the rifle. It'll scare my customers away. If the tiger hasn't already given them a heart attack. These displays are still in progress. I'm sure Miss Towler can adapt them. Of course I can. Shall we go downstairs, Mr. Selfridge? You're late. I got caught in a peace rally at the end of Oxford Street. It was utter chaos. Good morning, Mr. Selfridge! Good morning, Miss Hawkins. AGNES: Many of our beauty products are influenced by the Orient, so there'll be a display of Chinese parasols and fans behind the counter. Colorful, I hope, so they attract the eye? Very colorful, Miss Hawkins. Nobody will miss you. How about Accessories? Ah, Miss Mardle! You've come back to us. Indeed I have, Mr. Selfridge. Good morning. Morning. Your brother? Well, we buried him last week in Geneva. I am so sorry. Thank you. What have you planned for Accessories, Miss Towler? I haven't worked it out yet. But we must have something. Beauty is getting a whole display, as Miss Hawkins has informed me-- twice. GROVE: And you have less than a week. It is a bank holiday on Monday. A huge amount can be achieved in a small amount of time, and I'm sure that Miss Towler is aware of how important this Empire week is. I am, Mr. Selfridge. Very good. Carry on. My office now, Mr. Grove. I'm not going to beat about the bush, Mr. Grove. I'm disappointed in you. You're late all the time, office is a mess, you're not on top of Personnel. That is an unfounded accusation. All right, then, the basics: how many male staff do we employ? Eight hundred and fifty. Nine hundred and forty-nine. Female employees? I do have this information, Mr. Selfridge, just not at my fingertips. You have to know your people, otherwise you can't manage them. This is your final warning. Up your game or you're out. Good evening, sir. Good evening, Fraser. Is Mrs. Selfridge in? I'm afraid not, sir. (sighs) But you have a visitor, Mr. Selfridge. He's waiting in the courtyard. You wouldn't believe how glad I am to see you. I just came because Mrs. Selfridge was kind and visited me. I was rude to her. I wanted to apologize. She's not here. Stay for dinner. Oh, no, thank you. I have a whole humidor filled with cigars that were just delivered. Someone's got to smoke them with me. The same old Harry. I'm not so sure about that. Oh, no. I shouldn't have let you go. You couldn't have stopped me. No, but it was the way I did it. I don't know what I was thinking. I lost the greatest creative director around and my best friend, neither of which have been replaceable. Is this an apology from the great Mr. Selfridge himself? What am I supposed to do, beg? I'd like to see that very much. (laughing) Old friend. Come back to the store. No. No, absolutely not. Why not? I don't need your charity, Harry. It's me who needs you. The store's a mess, Henri. My heads of department, they're bickering, I'm about to sack my head of Personnel… Mr. Grove? I don't want to. But if he doesn't pull together, I'm going to have to. Well, I am sorry that you have problems at the store, but it makes no difference. Then there's Miss Towler. Agnes Towler? Yes. How is she? (sighs) She's the Head of Display now. I sent her to Paris to train under Lafayette. Yeah? She's under a lot of pressure. We have our Empire week celebration and she's struggling. Come and help her out. Come on, Henri. What do you say? Morning. Good morning. Good evening out? Yes, it was. Very. You missed Henri. He came to visit last night. Henri was here? He was coming to see you. He wanted to apologize. He doesn't have anything to apologize for. Thank you for finding him, Rose. He wouldn't have come here if it hadn't been for you. Well, that is not what you thought before. I was wrong, and I'm sorry. Yes, you were. I'm going to work. Gordon? Are you all right? I hate the fact that you and Pa aren't getting along. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to fight in front of you. He's trying so hard with you. Where did you get these? Gordon… (door slams) Thank you so much for coming. We can't be late for work. It's only I feel I need a man's opinion, and I don't know who to turn to. What's this all about? My brother spent most of his life abroad. He never married. And he left the house and the contents to you? It's such a responsibility. It's a gold mine! I can't sell any of it, Roger. It was his. It wouldn't feel right. How many bedrooms are there? Six. Well, live here. Take paying guests. They'd keep you company and provide a regular income. Actually, he left me an income as well. You're a woman of independent means. It's a great deal to take in. If I may say so, it couldn't have happened to a better person. Lady Loxley. BANKER: It's a while since we've seen you at the bank, Lady Loxley. MAE: Yes, indeed. (bell rings) Under no circumstances must Loxley ever know about this. I'll make sure of it, Lady Loxley. Thank you. Yes, you may put it away now. You're Jeremy, aren't you? That's right. I know your father. I can call you Jeremy, can't I? Of course. Have there been any rumors around the bank about my husband? I couldn't say. You see, I fear Loxley has money troubles. He's so solicitous, he doesn't want to worry me. But I'm his wife; I need to share his burdens. Is it true? I did hear my father talking about it with my grandfather. And? Gambling debts, apparently. People have asked him to honor them because of the uncertain times. Well, of course. How bad is it? My father said Lord Loxley's all washed up. PLUNKETT: I said you were taking no appointments. And I said Mr. Selfridge would make an exception for me. What is it, Lord Loxley? I am rather busy. Planning your Empire celebration? You've got to ask if there's anything to celebrate. We've sucked up to filthy types in Europe in order to protect our foreign interests. Look at the result. I haven't got time to talk politics. How about politicians, then? Winston Churchill would like to open your Empire week. I saw him last night at the House. He likes the fact that you're keeping the public happy, Selfridge. I suggested to him that he show up and do his bit. That's kind of you. I'll arrange it, then. Thank you. Oh, and you know I'm on the Military Procurement Committee. No, I didn't. I need a list of British leather manufacturers. We're in short supply of military boots. Getting ready, I'm afraid. Any thoughts? I know pretty much every leather manufacturer in Britain. Get me some names as soon as possible. I'll let the committee know you've done your bit. MARDLE: These drawers are a disgrace. I go away and everything falls to pieces. Where have you been, Miss Mardle? Somewhere nice, I hope? Mr. Leclair! How wonderful to see you! You too, looking so well. Pearls suit you. Oh! Uh, they're new. But then, you always did notice everything. Where can I find Miss Towler? Mr. Grove? I presume you know that unless I pull myself together, I'm out on my ear. The chief doesn't want that. None of us do. I've taken the liberty. I hope you don't mind. I ordered these manuals from America. Mr. Selfridge is always talking about keeping abreast of innovation. They contain some rather interesting ideas. You sent off for these? Yes. To America? For me? You'll get through this, Mr. Grove, I know you will. Rise to the challenge like the splendid chap you are. Good luck. As you pointed out so clearly in front of Mr. Selfridge, the tiger display isn't going to work in here, so I'm going to try something simple but still Indian in feel: silk cloths on the tables and bird cages out on the terrace. With live birds screeching at us all day? Thanks very much. What's the matter with you? Why are you being so difficult? All this? Some people have got real problems. (sighs) (sighs) That was a bit harsh. She's just trying to do her job. You're right. I don't know why I'm taking it out on her. I do. I just wish I could be normal around her. Go on, find her. Say sorry. Henri? Agnes? I've been looking for you everywhere. (laughing) Henri! Miss Towler, all grown up. Why are you here, Henri? Why aren't you in America? What about Valerie? I thought you were going out there to be with her? It did not work out. I'm sorry. But the job with the advertising agency, that must have been exciting. Yes, it was certainly that. But I want to talk about you. Head of Display? It's wonderful. The problem is I'm not very good at it. I don't believe that. We've got this exhibition opening next week, and it's just not right. Maybe I could help? Mr. Selfridge has asked me to come back just for the Empire Exhibition. But if you don't want me to, I won't. Henri, please come back. I need you. More than anything. You've been avoiding me. I haven't. I'm not angry about the pictures. I just want to say that what they represent… Well, it's not everything. Relations between men and women should be about love, Gordon, not just physical intimacy. Surely they should be about both. Isn't that the point of marriage? Excuse me? Since you and Pa stopped sharing a bedroom, neither of you have been happy. That is not true. And I wasn't thinking about your father and myself when… Maybe you should. You're making him miserable. Over the years, he's made me fairly miserable too! Why did you come back from America at all? You should either stay out there or be here and try to make it up with him. Gordon, it's very complicated. Do you still love him? Yes, I do. Then I don't see why it's complicated. (Gio speaking Italian) This is it for us. Finished. If there's a war, you think anyone will want to eat our food? More like they put us in front of a firing squad. It's not our fault. VICTOR: You've been here 30 years, Uncle Gio. Me and Franco were born here. I'm as English as the next man. In war, everything will change. (sobbing) Gabriella? Now look what you've gone and done. (sobbing) Don't take any notice of him. He always thinks the worst. He's right. They will come for me. Hey… No one's going to come for you. Oh, Victor… If there is a war, will you look after me? Of course I will. I was not sure you liked me, but now… I don't think we've met since that crazy tango night. Yes, well, I've been indisposed. Are you better now? Yes, I am. But I do have a favor to ask. I need a reliable locksmith to come to the house, and I was hoping you could organize a Selfridge man. Of course. This evening, while the Lords is in session. Loxley, he hates disturbances, so it's best to do the work when he's not there. I will arrange it, it's no trouble. Thank you. How is it, having Lord Loxley back in London? We're like ships that pass in the night. I was just wondering, are you having any financial problems? He closed your account, and I haven't seen you in the shop in weeks. Loxley hates to part with his money, that's all. So when he's in town, I have to behave. Nothing more than that? No, nothing more than that. He's asked me for a list of leather manufacturers for military boots, and I'd prefer to take that information to the Procurement Committee myself. But they won't open their doors to you, Harry. In a crisis, the establishment stick together. Can I trust Lord Loxley? You can trust Loxley. I promise you. That's all I need to know. You tell him that I'll run up a list for him in the next couple of days. Good day, Miss Hawkins. Come to see Mr. Selfridge, Mr. Edwards? No, I've come to see you. I'd like to take you out. We tried that, remember? It wasn't a success. I was a fool. Give me another chance. Maybe. Just as long as it's somewhere nice. Excellent. The bank holiday's set to be fine. I'll meet you outside Green Park underground station at 11:00. Till then. HENRI: You know what you've forgotten? The heart of the empire. It can't be… Great Britain. Oh, of course. Now you say it, it's seems so obvious. As they enter, the customer would see the British ﬂag. AGNES: Maybe a statue of Britannia? Excellent! Miss Hawkins. Mr. Leclair. Will there be a band? Yes. They must play British music. Mr. Leclair. Oh, Mr. Colleano. You're back. I'm just here to help with the Empire celebration. Very good. And what about Accessories, Mr. Leclair, Miss Towler? Well, this is the heart of the store, so with your permission, Miss Mardle, the Britannia will stand right here. Wonderful. Who is that gentleman, Mr. Colleano? Henri Leclair. Oh. So that's Leclair. I didn't imagine he'd look like that. What do you mean? He's rather shabby. Well, he can't just swan back into the store and expect his job back. Looks like he just has. (doorknob jamming) Mae? Let me in. I've been vouching for you around town, Loxley. But if you ever come near me again, I'll tell the whole world you're a bankrupt. Do you hear me? I'll scream it from the rooftops. Understand? What time is it? It's 9:00. 9:00? Why aren't you at work? It's a bank holiday, remember? Oh. Of course. Thank you. We need to talk. The news from Europe is getting worse. The French have mobilized troops along the German border. I was thinking… Perhaps you should go back to America. What? What's the point of you staying? You could be in danger, and I don't want that. I will not run away like a coward! Is that how you want people to think of me? Of course not. I'm just trying to do what's best for everyone. I'm sorry. I know I'm being difficult and you're just trying to make things right between us. I don't know how to get your trust back except to keep on trying. I don't know what's going to happen if there's a war. I have the store to think about, and my staff. Then let me help you. I can't leave now, not when you need me. I won't let you stay if it's about duty. It's not just about duty. Really? Really. Stay, then. And I promise, I swear by everything, I won't let you down. Thank you. But right now… I want to spend the day with my wife. We have a lot to catch up on. So that was how I got started: sweeping the floor of the post room of the Irish Times. Imagine. Mr. Frank Edwards, a broom pusher! A bit less of the "Mister" then. You'd have thought my name was "You there!" Oh, poor you. Bullied, were you? Terribly. How about you? How did you get started? My dad had a stall at Borough market. Now I know why you can sell anything to anyone. We're not so unalike, you and me. Except I'm on the way up and you are holding on by your fingertips. It's true, I need a scoop. Is that why you're always hanging round Mr. Selfridge? He's good COPY- Well, don't expect me to tip you off. Loyal, are you? Yes. Although I wish he'd sent me to Paris. Oh, London's not so bad. Dining alfresco in the sunshine. Another glass? Well, I suppose it is a holiday. There we are. Your good health. Right. (yawning and sighing) Thank you. You have done a good job. Good evening. That I think is enough for tonight. Now… I couldn't have done this without you, so… What is it? I can't accept this. Well, you used to give me presents all the time, so now it's my turn. Good morning, sir. Congratulations. This is truly incredible, Miss Towler! Well done. Thank you. And Henri, it's wonderful to have you back. Is Mr. Grove late again? I didn't see him on the floor. He's in his office, Mr. Selfridge. He's hardly left the building for the last four days. You might want to… Come in. (door opens) Good morning, Mr. Selfridge. This is quite a transformation, Mr. Grove. Well, I've put some new systems in place. Would you be interested if I were to show them to you? Go on. Right. Every member of staff is now catalogued in this filing system. Each one has a card which I will keep regularly updated. On it will be a record of their past employment, their present position and any other pertinent biographical facts. Efficiency and order. Exactly what we need. I've also begun an analysis on staff age. It's highlighted something. 80% of our male staff are eligible to join the Army. I'll keep this. Well done, Mr. Grove. Carry on the good work. (musicians tuning) It's lovely to meet you. Anything to say for the papers, Mrs. Selfridge? Only that I'm very proud of my husband. This is a wonderful exhibition and I'm very much looking forward to meeting Mr. Churchill. Harry! You made it. I wouldn't have missed this for anything. And how wonderful to see you in the store again, Henri. I behaved very badly towards you. Am I forgiven? Of course you are. Excuse me. Harry, this is very patriotic. You've captured the mood of the nation, as you always do. Thank you so much. Lord Loxley, can I speak to you for a moment? These are leather manufacturers from all over Britain. I've listed them in order of preference. These companies are first rate. These, you stay clear of. These are shoddy and not to be trusted. Thank you, Selfridge. This is just what I needed. Let me know how you get on with it. Will do. REPORTER: What's happening, Mr. Crabb? Any news? Are we going to be here all day, Mr. Selfridge? Any idea what's happening? Mr. Churchill will be here soon. (elevator bell rings) (whispering) (clears throat) Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Churchill won't be coming in today. (staff sighs with disappointment) Germany has declared war on France and invaded Belgium. (staff murmuring) The great British Empire… This map will not look the same, I think, for much longer. You may be right. Come on. Time for a drink. Mr. Selfridge. Mr. Leclair, welcome. Thank you. SELFRIDGE: Miss Day, I hear Rose has been talking to you about going into business. Oh, the club. No, I couldn't take Rose's money. I appreciate that. You're not at all as I expected, Miss Day. I'm not sure whether to take that as a compliment or not. Well, you should-- it was meant as one. We should start again. As friends. That's a lovely idea. To my Creative Director. No, Harry, it can't be like it was before. Why not? I'll give you an overview of the whole store. We can work together like we used to. I said I would just stay for the exhibition. I have other business to settle in London. SELFRIDGE: Like what? Trust me. It wouldn't be good for you or me if I stayed. DELPHINE: Everybody! News from the Palace! It's finally come. We're going to war. (crowd murmuring) ♪ Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves J" J" Britons never, never, never shall be slaves J" ♪ Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves J" J" Britons never, never, never shall be slaves. J" (cheering)
