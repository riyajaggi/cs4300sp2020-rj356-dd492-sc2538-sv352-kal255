 Read all about it! Belgium massacre! Many dead! Read all about it! Read all about it! Read all about it! Belgium massacre! Horrible, isn't it? Women and children, I heard. "No mercy shown," they say. If you want to read all about it, son, you need to buy it.

 It's a penny! Sorry, guv'nor. God bless you. Read all about it! "Hundreds dead," it says here. Something has to be done. Doesn't mean we have to be the ones to do it. Every Englishman must defend his country's honor. Says so right here on page two. (men laughing) AGNES: Well, I wouldn't believe everything that you read in the papers, George. You'll get your money. So you keep saying, Mr. Leclair. Yet so far, you have failed to keep your promises.

 Contact me when we can do business. I can't believe we've had so many replies to such a simple charity event. One still has one's uses. And I couldn't have done it without you. Of course you could. It simply would have taken you just a bit longer. Miss Day. Delphine! Rose! I didn't think you could make it. I saw the error of my selfish ways. Business can wait for a day, at least. If I can sell wine, I can sell Belgian chocolates for charity. Have you seen the headlines? These poor people! Yes, it is a dreadful business, I do agree. Mae and I were just discussing our Palm Court display. There's two choices. Mae prefers this one. Flags? Isn't it a little, um… …traditional? Or some would say patriotic. Which is why I suggested them. Of course, it really doesn't matter which one we choose. The most important thing… But just hanging there like that, it's so old fashioned. I mean, this one is far more interesting. Tables arranged in a circle, and lots of jolly bunting… Rose, which one do you prefer? One would hate to be considered old fashioned. Harry! We need your eye. Ladies. Oh, Monsieur Neuhaus and his delicious chocolates! Harry, we are raising money for the Belgian refugees. No free samples. We're just discussing the display. Tables arranged in a circle with lots of lovely bunting, or flags hanging by tables in two straight rows? This one. A circle every time. It's more… modern. ROSE: Good. Good. Good, good. So then we're all agreed? So let's see, we will start with Monsieur Neuhaus's demonstration and then the leaflets and donation forms will be made available, so then all we really have to do is just take the money. (laughing) I admire you all. And you certainly make it sound simple. I'm sorry, Harry? Well, all I'm saying is that keeping a store full of customers happy is harder than it looks. Rose, I do believe your darling husband is setting us a challenge. You think us women aren't up to it? No, no, no, I'm simply saying… Ah! I think you're right. Well, let's just see, shall we, Harry? I think you'll find that we ladies can be the stalwarts of Self ridge's. Thank you. DELPHINE: I've had another idea: samples and collection points all over the store. That way we can maximize our takings. If Harry doesn't object? I'll talk to him. He does seem in good spirits. I will admit that things are better. (laughing): Not like that! Oh, my goodness. So I will see you at 2:00? I think we have a point to prove, don't we? We do. There you are, Miss. Thank you. GIO: (speaking Italian) I've not even made up my mind yet. I am a sick man. I know, I know, you're dying. This heart is weak. Weak! It's the Colleano family curse. You don't need to go to war! But if I did, you'd have help-- Gabriella. GIO: Gabriella is just a girl. Running a restaurant is man's work. Maybe man's work is fighting a war. I'll see you tonight. We can talk then. (muttering in Italian ) All the talk appears to be of joining up. Has Mrs. Grove mentioned it to you at all? Although my complexion may suggest otherwise, I'm a little too old, Mr. Crabb. War is a young man's game, surely? You would think so. However, Mrs. Crabb really seemed quite keen on the idea. One almost thinks she sees it as a way of getting me out of her hair. Ah. All right, in you come. Murdered, they say! Women and children shown no mercy. All on the direct orders of the Kaiser himself. Question is, what are we going to do about it? We fight! Matter of honor, I reckon. You can smash as many German heads as you like, George Towler, but break my French champagne and I'll shoot you myself. (chuckles) So you're signing up, then? First chance I get. Try and stop me. Yeah, I reckon the girls love a man in uniform! FRANCO: Lucky for you. With a face like that, you need all the help you can get. Yeah, all right. Does your Agnes know about this, George? She will, soon enough. I wish I was going with you. They say you have to be 16. GEORGE: What about you two? Coming to teach the Hun a thing or two? All in good time. No rush, is there? Tell that to them poor Belgians. Clearly we cannot prevent the men from enlisting, but I don't see how we can keep their positions open. Well, we've always prided ourselves on being different. Better. Now, this is just another example. Temporary posts will be impossible to fill. No, they will be difficult, but not impossible. And if the politicians are right, we'll have our boys back by Christmas. I wish I shared your confidence. We must hope for the best and prepare for the worst. We mustn't overreact. Yes, but we must do something. Three months may as well be three years if we have no staff. What about those who are too old to enlist? At least we know they won't be running off to war. We're talking about physical work: deliveries, the loading bay. Just because one is elderly… I want you both to explore every option. Whatever it takes. I won't let my men down. This your doing, is it? My restaurant filled with foreign flags and staffed by amateurs? I think Mrs. Selfridge just wants to help the refugees. DAVE: Tell him what Arthur told you downstairs, Ed. Babies on bayonets. Civilians. It's not right. GEORGE : You can say that again. Your George is already polishing his medals. Can't wait to bloody the Kaiser's nose. Has he told you he's enlisting? Yes, he has. Seems like half the store are going. I know he won't listen to me. Perhaps you could have a word with him, ask him to at least think about it? Not a chance. Got enough on my plate arguing with Uncle Gio. Apparently it's every brave ltalian's duty to stay at home and make tagliatelli. But what are you going to do? I don't know. Yet more men, Mr. Selfridge. At this rate, we'll have our very own regiment. Mr. Crabb. Yes, chief? My wife's charity event today. I have an idea how to round it off. Indeed? But it'll take a little organization on your part. And I need it to be a complete surprise. AGNES: All I'm saying is that you could have discussed it with me. Why? So you could try and change my mind? You're my brother! And this is my country! Everybody's got a choice, George. Yes, they do. And I've made mine. I want you as my deputy. At a time like this, I need a man with your experience and your talent. I don't think so, Harry. We all need our lucky charms. Even me. So what do you say? Be my right hand man. This war, with everything so uncertain… All the more reason to come back to what you know. I want to keep my friends close by, Henri. I'm honored, but… Is it about the money? Because if it is… Just tell me when to stop. Stop this. Okay, okay, fine, I'll stay. But for six months, no longer I'll take it. And you have to live at my house. With the girls back in the States, it's like the Savoy on a Sunday. That won't be necessary. Absolutely no negotiations. (laughing) You are an impossible man. And look where it got me! (chuckling) A begging bowl? Absolutely not. I just thought that all of the customers should be made aware of the charity event. By littering my department with sweets and scraps of paper? I'm sorry, but Mrs. Selfridge specifically asked me to… This is fashion, not some common Confectioners. I believe Ms. Towler is simply trying to do her job. And I am simply trying to do mine, Mr. Leclair. I am in charge of what happens here. I'm afraid I must insist. On whose authority? I am now Mr. Self ridge's deputy. He has given me a free hand on all creative decisions. But if you still wish to discuss it with him personally… That won't be necessary. I'm glad you decided to stay on. But I'm still a little confused. What exactly is your role? Apparently anything Mr. Selfridge wants it to be. Harry made me a good offer. OPERATOR". Just connecting you now, sir. MAN". Paddington 217. Mr. Webb, I have your money. I'll meet you at 4:00. LADY MAE". You're a working woman, Pimble. Which one screams modest but elegantly practical? I'd say you were spoiled for choice, m'lady. So diplomatic. You decide. Oh… I imagine Loxley may have more boot manufacturers calling today. Very good. So I need you to be my Eye of Providence, Pimble. Seeing all, saying nothing. Understand me? Completely, m'lady. What about the chocolate boxes? I thought simple. Yes. Yes, it's certainly that. I thought that the message should speak loudest. Or with a ribbon. What do you think? I think you know exactly what you're doing. No ribbon, no bow. Just the message. Simple. Perfect. Your references are impeccable, Mr. Jones. Anything else, Mr. Grove? Just one. Could you lift that packing case and place it on my desk? (grunting) Don't… (loud thud) Mr. Colleano, is the Palm Court prepared? I believe so, Mr. Selfridge. Good. I don't need to tell you that my wife is very keen that today runs smoothly. However, I'm sure that you will appreciate that she and her friends may not be quite so… Experienced in sales? Indeed. So any help that you and Franco could give needs to be discreet. This is her day, all right, Victor? And so it should be. Leave it to me, Mr. Selfridge. Thank you. Miss Plunkett! Miss Plunkett, do you have any smelling salts? Of course, the praline was originally developed by my father. A sweet chocolate shell for the bitter medicine our doctors insist on giving us. To… sweeten the pill? However my family was the first to realize that a beautiful chocolat could also be a vessel of pure, unadulterated pleasure. He's very handsome. You mean for a Belgian? It is also my pleasure to see so many of you here in support of my country. But I'm sure you will agree that my deepest thanks should go to the person who has made this possible: Mrs. Selfridge, the beautiful Rose. Here. Voilà. (applause) We should definitely learn to do that. I'm sorry, they just look too good to eat. Please. Delicious. Truly delicious. (applause) Oh no, I quite agree. It's dreadful what's been going on. Even my chauffeur has joined up. Really? Is one expected to walk? Your chocolates, Lady Colclough. And I think you'll find everything you need to know in this pamphlet. How kind. Thank you very much. We were having a conversation. About the affairs of the day, no less. And meanwhile, people are waiting to be served. One thing I've learned when running a club is that little of yourself can go a long way. If you expect me to be brusque… This event means a lotto Rose. As her friend, I would hate to let her down. I know you feel the same. Who's next, ladies? For the customers, I think. But we've donated, Miss Mardle. Ha'penny each. And they're ever so delicious. You should try one. (clears throat) Yes, well, they do look rather good. For the Belgians, Miss. Yes, of course. Another? Yes. She's in her element. You know, I don't think I've seen that expression on her face for a long time. What expression? The way she looks when she's truly inspired by something. For a while, I thought it had gone forever. Your own column! You know what they say: you can't keep a good man down! All I need now is a story. Well, I'm very proud of you. (seductively): And I think that you deserve a reward… Ha'penny for the girls, but I'm sure a man with his own newspaper column can afford to put his hand in his pocket? Excuse me. I couldn't help noticing that no one had offered you a chocolate. Oh! Thank you. No, that's very kind. In fact, I shouldn't really be here. And I've only got thruppence left. Please. I really mustn't. Do you know it is a medical fact that a woman's body temperature is always a degree or so warmer than a man's? Always? Always. Which bien sur means that for a woman, the entire chocolate experience is just that little bit more sensual. (gasps) Please. Thank you, but I really don't think it's appropriate in the… (gasps) (laughs) Sa bonne? Oh, yes! I saw you and I thought, "There is a lady in dire need of champagne." What a perceptive man you are. Cheers. Cheers. It's a fine cause. Yes, we must all do our bit. Even the landed gentry. A little bird told me Lord Loxley's working for the Ministry of Procurement. Those little birds should keep their beaks shut. I must say I was surprised. I thought he was more interested in slaughtering pheasants. Germans, pheasants. All grist to my husband's ample mill. So it's true? Well, you know what they say, Frank: war brings out the best in people. Luckily, I have a cousin in London. But I know others from my country are not so fortunate. They have lost their loved ones, their homes. And here we are eating chocolates. It all seems so wrong somehow. No. You are doing all you can. Please. Oh, no. No, thank you. I don't think I will. Would you excuse me, please? What are you doing here? Looking for some champagne. They are drinking us dry. There's more down in the loading bay. You best nip down there, then. (laughs) Please take one of these. Here are your chocolates, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you, goodbye. I admit it. You have proved me wrong. You should thank Delphine. She could give you lessons. DELPHINE: You're talking as if we're finished. What about the rose basket? But I haven't even priced it. Goodness knows how much it's even worth. Don't you think we ought to find out? I have 17 pounds, all for a wonderful cause. Now surely some of you rich, handsome men can reach into your deep pockets? (crowd chuckling) Mr. Frank Edwards! Any special lady who needs seducing? I guarantee this wonderful gift could woo a harem! Too rich for my blood. Find yourself a millionaire. Wonderful idea. If only we had one in the audience. (crowd laughing) Mr. Harry Selfridge! Please, I am merely an observer. Oh, go on! No one you want to impress? (laughing) Fine, 18 pounds. I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear that. Did he say 20 pounds? (crowd shouting): Yes, 20! It's so loud in here. Going, going… Sold to Mr. Selfridge for 25 pounds! (cheering) Franco? (men shouting) Hey! Pack it in! Wait, there's money on this! Get back to work, all of you! Or you can explain yourselves to Mr. Selfridge! He called us cowards. Said we were refusing to sign up. So you start a fight. Why sign up for a country that hates us? AGNES: Sit still or you'll make it worse. They're all idiots, Victor, George included. Or maybe they're right? LORD LOXLEY". Your boots come highly recommended, Mr. Pratt. Double stitched seams, m'lord, for strength. Fully treated leather uppers. Guaranteed waterproof for 90 days. You understand this is a very valuable contract? PRATT: Absolutely, m'lord. I'm seeing several people like you today. Tradesmen. Healthy competition. We supply nothing but the best. Mr. Selfridge himself… Yes, yes, I don't need the patter. What I need, Mr. Pratt, is my money back, or at least some of it, in return for my continued patronage. If you understand me? I can assure you I've quoted you my very best price. (sighs) Are you an honest man, Mr. Pratt? Of course, m'lord. Thank you. That's all I need to know. You don't have to go. Yes, I do. Truth is, I just couldn't face myself. I couldn't put on patent leather every morning knowing your George was lacing up his boots at the same time. So male pride? No, but… …maybe there are some things that are worth fighting for. Don't do this for me, Victor Colleano. If you want to do something for me, then you'll stay right here. I don't want you to go. Every soldier needs something to come home for. Or someone. Well, then I'll just have to worry about the two of you. Look after George for me, won't you? I know what those French girls are like. They're far more deadly than a German bullet. I won't let him out of my sight. Promise. Thank you so much for your help today. Well, you know me, always game for new experiences. Since Loxley came back to town, things have been… they've been difficult. I really enjoyed being part of today. You do know you can always count on me, Rose. No matter what happens. How do you mean? Mae, is everything all right? Never worry about me, Rose. Never. I'm fine. I'm like a champagne cork in the bathtub: always popping back up. A bit like Miss Day in that respect. She's certainly full of surprises. I must admit she was very entertaining today. Wasn't she incredible? I wish I had her confidence. She sees something she wants and she just takes it. It's very inspiring. Quite. Unless, of course, it's something you want to keep. Hoodwinked in my own store! I'm sorry, Harry. But if anyone deserves it, Rose does. And naked generosity is such good publicity. You may be right. Raising money is all very well, but I could do so much more. You're not thinking of enlisting, are you? I'm serious. I could help the war effort. As an American, I'm still free to travel. I can do better than boots and breeches. Maybe you're talking to the wrong people. Leave it with me. Perhaps I can make you a few new friends. I'm glad we see eye to eye. I need the first consignment by the end of the week. And our financial arrangement? I'll deposit it myself, m'lord. Discretion assured. Better be. This ship goes down, then she's taking all hands with her. This must be kept between us and us alone. Nobody wants any problems. (crowd talking excitedly) (glass clanking) Thanks to all of you, we have raised a great deal of money for a very worthy cause. I ask you now to raise your glasses to the people who made this possible: my wife Rose… …and the stalwarts of Selfridge's. ALL: Stalwarts of Selfridge's! (applause) And now I have one final surprise for all of you. Follow me, please. This way. (drumroll sounding) (crowd murmuring) What's this? Shoulders back. Chests out. And quick march! Left! Left! Left! (drumroll continues) (marching loudly) SELFRIDGE: Ladies and gentlemen, these are our boys. Our men. Our soldiers. Off to fight for king and country. And when they return victorious, every man will have his job waiting for him at Selfridge's. (talking excitedly) Mob fit for a hero. Three cheers for the Selfridge Brigade! Hip hip! Hooray! Hip hip! Hooray! Hip hip! Hooray! Men, you are all free to sign up. Company dismissed! (applause) Write to me, Miss Hawkins? Everyone needs a sweetheart! Of course I will, George! Every day without fail! Three cheers! King, country and Miss Kitty Hawkins! Hip hip! Hooray! Name? Towler. George Towler. Report to Aldershot first thing. Next? You are Clarence Wilson of 18 Curtis Road, Pimlico. 21 years old with no physical ailments… You must feel very proud, Agnes. And utterly terrified. Gosh, is it that obvious? Having a large house is all well and good, but one does tend to rattle around in it. Anyway, that's why I was going to invite you to come and stay there. Just until George returns. If you'd like. I'd like that very much. Splendid, my dear. Excuse me. Of course. Is everything all right? I must find Victor. Well, he's… Victor! It's Uncle Gio. He's collapsed. You know what? I think we pulled it off. Indeed. Yet it still leaves us with a problem. Who will replace them? Not to fear. Mr. Grove has it in hand. You'll be hearing from me. (door opens and closes) Women? Women. In the loading bay? In the loading bay, in the kitchens, driving the lorries. And this was all Mr. Selfridge's idea? "If my wife's friends can do it, anyone can." And that's a direct quote from the chief. They're to step in until the men return. Every job in the store now available to both men and women. That advertisement goes in tomorrow. Women? I'm sorry. What did the doctor say? It's a heart attack. I think it's a wonderful idea, Miss Mardle. Well, we must all help as much as we can. I have room to spare and these poor Belgian refugees don't even have a roof over their heads. You seem to know an awful lot about it? It seems it's the least I could do. Monsieur Neuhaus spoke to me at great length about their problems. Clearly a most sensitive man. Vittorio? Here, Uncle. The doctor? Gone, Uncle. This is nothing. Something I have eaten that didn't agree with me. But until I am well again… You will stay? Take charge of this family. Of course, Uncle. You promise me this? I promise. (doorbell rings) (snoring) (snoring stops) Victor! (sobbing) You're turning in? Would you say goodnight to Henri for me? Of course I will. (yawning) I can barely keep my eyes open. I don't know how your ladies manage. I had such a wonderful day. Thank you for making it possible. How could any sane man refuse the request of such a beautiful woman? You're incorrigible. I'm in love. (sighs) incorrigible! (laughs) (knock on door) Thank you. So you meant it? Every job kept open? No exceptions. It'll cause a stir. So you'll put it in your new column? "Let Selfridge's lead the way. Set the example." These are our boys, Frank. They're fighting for us. And dying for us. There's news from Mons. Reports of many dead. Hundreds, maybe more. It was a rout. You're quite sure? These are reliable sources. Men on the ground I'd trust with my life. The worst of it? Churchill and Kitchener won't let me write the truth. Press Bureau? Suppress Bureau. Our men have a right to know what they're marching into. This is censorship, pure and simple. One battle does not make a war. They probably have good reason. You approve of this? Men need leaders. Inspirational leaders. So you'd make fools of them? The merest hint of uncertainty will wreck morale. They need to believe. Or we make them believe? I'm sorry, Harry, but this time you and I will have to differ. I'll run your story. Right now, it's the only one I've got. Can't say he didn't warn us. Every day, the same. "I'm dying, Vittorio." Silly old fool. He made me promise to stay here. His last wish. Your family needs you. Franco, Gabriella… Anyway, I don't think I could have managed to say goodbye to both you and George on the same day. At least this way I get to keep one of you. I'm no coward, Agnes. I know that. (footsteps approaching) I'm so sorry. Uh, here, I should go. This is a time for family. I'll let Mr. Grove know about your loss. (door closes) You love her. Thanks for coming on such short notice. Thank you for the drink. And the story. It's late. What did he want? Oh, nothing. Just a quote for his new column. You know me: can never resist publicity. Night, Pa. Goodnight, son. I'm going out. To the pub? We're celebrating. Well, not like that you're not. Aggie! George Towler, I've been looking after you for years. I'm not about to stop now. I just hope your uniform fits you better than your coat does. (laughs) I'm going to miss you. I'll miss you too. You might be all I've got, but you're all I've ever needed. You know that? You'll do. Just promise me one thing. What's that? Come home to me. I promise.
