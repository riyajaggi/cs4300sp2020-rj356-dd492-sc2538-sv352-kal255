 The dead - they sigh to me. They tell me to seek a warrior - more monster than man,... and only he can help me save my people. Father. I'm not your father. I just sired you. KA: You will go to the Great Pa and confront your father. I am going to cut you out of my lineage... once and for all.

 He is the answer to our problem. There's a tear in the earth. This one I made. But it connects the world of the living and the world of the dead. Come, if you dare! So now you can heal the world. And you... Perhaps you were sent here for a reason, boy. You brought me to this place from the start. It's not luck, is it? Could be destiny. This Ka, what's he told you? He said that the girl is important.

 TE KAIPO: I need you to do something for me. What? Get three of my people. I need them to repair the world. I'll do it... alone. Hako will take you. - MEHE: You need me. - I don't need you. Never did. I don't need you. Never did. WAKA: Stay away from my father. You were drawn here. You've been touched by the gods. Come with me to the Place of the Spirits. You said you'll show me the truth, so show me. How could the dead returning make things better? By being an army... for me. It's time to heal the world. Understand? How do you think it will be done? WAKA: I didn't do all of this just to see you die. KA: Protect her, Waka Nuku Rau, for she has a gift that not even she knows she possesses. You are here for a reason. The gods have willed it. MEHE: The dead - they sigh to me,... and I must heed their calls, listen to their sighs, because they are the dead, and we all meet them in the end. Papa. Listen to me. Our family, Mehe - there's something dark and wrong about us. Your uncle... Mehe Te Wehiwehi. Am I dreaming? If I am, wake me up now. You are dreaming. In dreams, the dead are closer to the living. You're dead. But your father is still very much alive. You saw it. You can feel it, can't you? Feel it in your bones,... like an aching. But you could still save him,... if you do something for me. Anything. Would you give your life to the world? Would you give it freely? Would you do that? Then you need to go south. There's a warrior there who will help you. What's his name, this toa? His name? KA: Waka... Nuku... Rau. Where are you going? South, to find Waka Nuku Rau. You won't help me,... but he might. RANGI: Mehe. Mehe! How am I to earn honour in the world by sacrificing innocents? Who are you talking to? You shouldn't feel bad. I come willingly. - You say that now. - I say that always, as a tohunga, for peace. You did this? You sealed it in? Hurry. KAEWA: Who are you? WAKA: No one. You don't look like no one. Well, looks can't be trusted. Now, stop talking... and walk faster. What is it? Run. Where's Kaewa? Kaewa is dead. What do you want? To warn you. You didn't defeat those warriors. What are you talking about now? It was too easy. - Too easy? One of them ate- - They let you win. - I defeated them. - Oh, shut up. Against one, perhaps, but three? They let you go. - Why? - Exactly. I feel the hand of the dead in this. I have right from the start. Believe me when I tell you, my son, the dead - they sigh, and they scheme. Beware the dead. You say some strange things in your sleep, e hoa. You speak to the dead. The dead lie. Hurry. Open the gates, you shit-eaters. I don't like to think what he'll say when he finds out you got that girl killed. . Just two. - There was- - Excuses? You always had a world full of excuses. Can't you just use those two? You can leave now. You have no more use... to anyone! Do you know what he's got planned? He's going to sacrifice them. Everywhere that man walks, there's blood. You're no different. He's squirmed his way into your mind, hasn't he? He just wants to fix the world. So do we. Forget the past. We have to help him. - He only helps himself. - He helped me... to speak to my ancestors. You spoke to the dead? Fool. It's dangerous. But it's all right for you to do it, is it? - They lie. - So do you! Well, makes us a pair. Fine. Go to the afterlife, talk to the dead, listen to their lies. All they do is stalk around in the mist and hide behind dead trees. trees. I've been there. Where? The afterlife. Where do think? I doubt it. There-There was a warrior. Would you give your life to the world? What's wrong with you? Take me. I'll be the third sacrifice. - No, you won't. - Waka, shut up. Nei te kawau maro. Te umanga kapukapu. Waka, this has nothing to do with you. It's not your choice. E pai ana mariunga ma. Ki te rakau! You can't trust him. I know what he did to you was wrong. He knows. But that's in the past. Don't let it trap you. You're the one who's trapped. What are you talking about? Your father. That's why you're doing this. You can't make it any better, and it won't take anything away. You're right. It won't. But it'll change everything else, you idiot! Promise me you'll fix the world. I don't want the world as it is. Who would? Not dead yet, I see. You're acting like a child. I spent my whole life being a slave to that man, trying to be what I thought he wanted, trying to please him. I was your age... when he finally asked something of me. Our tribe was attacked. I was to sacrifice myself so that the others could escape into the night. I went down... to the blood and death,... fought until my arms hung useless at my sides. Then I used my teeth. But here you are. They didn't finish it. They saw my tribe retreat, left me for dead, followed them and slaughtered as many as they could. And when I returned,... drenched in the blood of our enemies,... my father... blamed me... for all of it. And for the last time, he beat me. So I left. I took my pain and my anger, and I carved it into my skin. Made a bad job of it. He just wants to make things right. Come with me, Mehe. Leave these shit-eaters to their schemes. You are still the same selfish man that I first met. You are never going to sacrifice yourself for anything - for one life, three - so that the dead can rest. So that my father can join our ancestors. - Look, I meant- - You meant what you said! Tell me one thing. The warrior you saw in the afterlife - what did he look like? Ka! Come out, you shit-eater. You got what you wanted. You sent her to me. Admit it! This is all your doing. Ka! Ka! KA: Greetings, Waka Nuku Rau. You've lied to me from the beginning. Say it. No. I have told you only the truth - always the truth. I told you to protect her, that she had a gift even she didn't know she possessed. I told you that she was important to your father, didn't I? So how have I lied to you? She's going to die. Now help me change her mind. She's going to die. Now, will you help me or not? I... am trying to fix the world. I'm trying to make it as it should be. And you... have served your purpose. You can stay here, out of harm's way. Ka! Don't you realise? I'm not trapped here with you. You're trapped here with me. Ka! Ka, send me back! Ka, you shit-eater! Ka! Waka, I won't let it be like this at the end. Waka? Waka? I'm sorry. If you can hear me, I have to do this for our people. I don't want to. I want to live so much it makes my hands shake. But that's the point of a sacrifice, isn't it? Giving up something you really want. I've learned s-so much from you, Waka Nuku Rau. But you have learned nothing from me. Shit-eaters. Shit-eaters! Finally, you turn up when you're needed. Send me back! Keep your voice down. Why are you here? You talked to this Ka after what I told you? Send me back. Why? For this girl? She betrayed you, and not for the first time. I deserved it - every time. She's right. I'm selfish. Aue. It's a strange thing, the human heart. Maybe you have one after all. It's not like that. Well, what, then? Aroha. Love? Compassion? You? All I know is that I don't want her to die. You'd leave the world broken,... throw away our glory for her?! You know my father won't fix anything. You know it in your bones! Or have you become the fool? How does it profit me to save her? What if she's the key to all of this? What are you talking about? She's been touched by the gods. Even my father believes that. If I help you, you must promise me that you will fix the world, even if it means her death in the end. Swear. If it really will? Yes. And you can have my life too, Mother. Is that enough blood for you? Well, you'd better hurry. E ta ko nga tohu he karere no mua i. CROWD: Ae. Whakaoho wairua te mihi ake ai i. CROWD: Ae. He kawenga korero no whakapata i. CROWD: Ae. Me rongo te aroha o Hine kino i. - Ae. - CROWD: Ae. It's time. SENTRY: Wait! SENTRY: Wait! I challenge you... for leadership of this tribe. It is my right, as your bastard. - Stop it. - Make me! And none of your cowardly fucking tricks this time. I don't need them. You are not as good as you think you are. You never were. Leave him alone, or I won't do it. Are you going to risk everything for him? Even the suffering of your ancestors,... your family? He is my family now. His life for mine - that's the price. Go. You need to be cleansed and made tapu again because of him. TE KAIPO: You. Yes. Out here. Where an army of the dead waits. Hako, set me free. If you do, I'll kill my father. I'll take over this tribe, and you can be my war general. Many wives - as many as you want. I'd want a great many. Yours - all of it! Leave. WAKA: Hako. Hako! When you were a boy, I admired you - the way you kept trying against your betters, the fight in you. And the more I pushed you away, the stronger you became. But I never loved you. Some things are hard to love. I should have killed you the first moment I saw you, Father. I told you - I just sired you. HINENGANA: E ta ko nga tohu he karere no mua i. E ta ko nga tohu he karere no mua i. Whakaoho wairua te mihi ake ai i. TUHAERE: Ae. Whakaoho wairua te mihi ake ai i. He kawenga korero no whakapata i. TUHAERE: Ae. He kawenga korero no whakapata i. TUHAERE: Ae. Me rongo te aroha o Hine kino i. TUHAERE: Ae. Whakaheke I waho, whakaheke I tua, whakaheke I roto, ki tenei pononga nau. Whakaheke I waho, whakaheke I tua, whakaheke I roto, ki tenei pononga nau. E ara, e ara koutou. Whakamaua kia tina. ALL: Tina. Haumi e... hui e... taiki e. What are you doing? My husband... Do you trust me? You lied. I told you I would make it right. I'll do more than that. I'll bring peace to our people. My enemies will be my army, but the rest - your father, my son - will go to the afterlife. I can fix this. Madness. It's madness! We'll see. Whakaheke I waho,... whakaheke I tua,.. whakaheke I roto,... ki tenei pononga nau. Whakaheke I waho, whakaheke I tua,... whakaheke I roto, ki tenei pononga nau. E ara,... e ara koutou. It worked? Ka po mai... te ra ki tua. Ka tu mai, ka tu mai te ao roa ki tua. Whakamaua kia tina. Haumi e, hui e, taiki e! Run. Go! This place... is ours now. Aue. Thank you, Mehe Te Wehiwehi. You, and you alone, opened the way for us. You were dedicated to us. Remember? Te tohu onamata. He tohi. TE KAIPO: Your people were always close to us. Our family,... there's something dark and wrong with us, Mehe. You fear me. Uri said you fear me. As we fear Whiro, the disrupter. Just like you, Mehe Te Wehiwehi. Wives - as many as you want. You're going to have to work harder than that to get at me, all you shit-eaters. Fuck! The protection doesn't work any more! - What's happened? - My husband is dead. We're all dead. WAKA: The cave! Run! No! No! SCREAMS: No! Stop! DISTORTED: You will be rewarded... beyond your dreams. HAKO: Aue! I have to find Mehe. - Wives, many wives. - Many wives. WAKA: Run! WAKA: Hako, open up! Kua tae mai te iwi o mate. Are you giving up? There's not that many. - Hardly any. - It'll be easy - too easy. I wish it was harder. We'll make for the gate. - We won't make it. - You got a better idea? We make for the rear palisade, then down into the valley. - Stay close. - You stay close. I'll look after you, old man. Kia tu. Kia oho. Kia mataara. Hako! Waka! Waka! Waka! No! Waka! Waka! No! No! Waka! Why Mehe? It's not personal, Waka Nuku Rau. The innocent have always been used by the strong. You people throw them into battle to die so you can gain more land, more wives, more glory. You know this. You've always known this. You said 'you people'. You knew too much. You know too much about everything. It could only be... if you are the god Whiro himself! Whiro could stop a soul on its way to the afterlife and send it back. Send you back. Very good, Waka Nuku Rau. Perhaps you learned something from the girl after all. TURIKA: The dead, they lie. And so do the gods, it seems. We all lie. Time for you to go. Unless you want to join the dead. It was good to see you, Mother. I prefer you dead. Mehe. WAKA: The dead - they call to us, and we must listen to them and heed their sighs. But know this about the dead - they lie, even more than the living,... because the dead want what we have - life. And we will fight them for it until the very end. E hiahia nei te hunga mate I te ora. A, ka whawhai tonu matou, ake ake.
