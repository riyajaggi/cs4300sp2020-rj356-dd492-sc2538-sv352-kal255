 Is Alina still here? Costine took her to the hospital. He bit her nose off! Come on, let me go! Let me go! Let him go and get him a towel. You the police? - I own the building. - I know my rights. - Your rights? - The right to call my lawyer, the right to call the British Embassy, and the right to sue the fucking shit out of you.

 Why would you do that? Because I caught her going through my wallet. It's a lie! You lie! Oh, how would you know? A camera! You have cameras in here? Now I'm definitely suing you. - Get out of my... - Wait a second. Wait outside. Close the door. You don't want to sue. You want to go home, you're gonna sleep it off, yeah? I should call the police. 2:25, if you call now, the district officer on duty will be Axel, Manu or Joran...

 Actually, I believe Manu is on holiday. I do not give a fucking shit. I am out of here. Grand. All I need before you depart is your watch. - What? - It sounds like the woman you injured isn't going to be able to work for a while. That will help with her expenses. Fuck you! Let me out of here! Let me out! It could've been so easy. What are you doing? But he's a butcher, Sylvie. What Ayaz did to that boy... We want him off the plane! He stays in Alaska! What did Mathieu say? He's fuelling up the tanks. Who cares what he says? He's not the boss. You could let me tell you my version of the story. Obviously, there's context! Context? For a murder? There was no murder, Rik. I can explain. Explain this instead! - What's gotten into you? - What do you mean? Since day one, you felt something was off with that guy. Now we know what, but you don't care. Hey, arsehole. The kid's sleeping here. Don't call me an arsehole. There's a kid trying to sleep and you're shouting, arsehole! - Look, all I'm trying... - Hey! Calm down. I'm trying to protect the passengers, that's all. - Doesn't your Bible tell you... - No. Not "my" Bible, "the" Bible. Doesn't the Bible say something about... not being a dick unless you happen to be perfect? I'm not casting the first stone, I'm talking about justice. I'm talking about respecting a moral code. It's all we have left. All fuelled up. Will that window work? Once I trimmed the glass, it went in nicely. It should hold, but it would be better to get the right part if we stop in Belgium. Aren't we heading south? To Hawaii? The sun will be up soon. We have to head west. ♪ The west is the best ♪ The Doors. Don't you know them? What's that? Something from last century? Mathieu? We have to leave Ayaz here. I need a nap. Call me when he's done showing off for Terenzio. It's nothing to do with him. But we have to do something, Mathieu. You and Terenzio wanted us to make decisions as a group. Yes, and? Well, argue your case, and let the group decide. Either way, we're taking off in 20 minutes. So, you admit that you not only desecrate bodies, but you're also a pimp and a drug dealer. I said I was a businessman with many investments. - You're a criminal. - A survivor! Guys, why risk having someone like that among us? Why compromise on our core commandments... of right and wrong? I came to Belgium 25 years ago with nothing. I won't apologise for wanting to survive. You can't do much else as an outsider. How dare you say that? My mother, bless her soul, also came to Belgium with nothing, - and she died... - With all due respect, Laura... I imagine she died with nothing. - Please... - Don't talk to her like that. You aren't a man. You aren't a real Muslim! - Listen... - Finally. - We leave in five minutes, Terenzio. - Yes, yes. You told Jakub about a stop in Belgium. Our best shot at Hawaii is first fixing the window properly. - Our maintenance centre is there. - We can't go back there. - I don't want to see what it's become. - I get that. But there's another reason to go back to Brussels. At NATO, they weren't just talking about disaster. They also mentioned a shelter. - What? - A shelter? Where? I didn't catch the details, but there must be documents. I've already seen this man act under pressure. - I've seen him excel in a crisis. - What? If we have to go on a mission like that, I won't make it without him. But... have you gone soft? Just because he saved your life! That's right. Why only tell us this now? I gave the army my all, and to no longer be considered... essential, well, I didn't want to accept it. But I do think our best chance of survival can be found at NATO. It would be crazy to lose our best man just before the mission. You don't need Ayaz to go to NATO. You've got me. And Mathieu, Horst... Rik, I've trained soldiers. The only true fighter here, besides me, is him. Don't forget the soldier who saved all our lives. Of course, sorry. But I imagine she'll have to stay aboard to help you. So, if we don't agree, if we don't want this man to help you, you won't help us? That's right. I'll vouch for this man. If he does anything else, the slightest misstep, you can throw me off, too. Raise your hand if you agree with the plan. Okay, great. All aboard, everyone. Thank you. You saved my life. Now, I've saved yours. We aren't friends. We're even. Stay out of my way until Brussels. Sure thing, partner. Those any good? I hadn't eaten sweets in seven years. Now, who gives a shit? So, anyway, you're one of those Internet people, right? Yes, I'm what's known as "an influencer." I should know what that means, but... It means people pay me to promote their products and stuff... on social networks. - Understand? - No, not really. - I'm really out of the loop. - Mmm. I guess I won't any more, either. - Want one? - No, thanks. I thought you could check for any updates. See if anything's been posted about NATO or Hawaii. - Me? - Yes, you. Why don't you ask Horst? Wasn't he some kind of network guy? He's doing something with Laura. Something? As in, "something"? Damn, she doesn't waste any time. - Horst needs a word. - I said I wasn't sure. Horst needs a word. Okay. Better, buddy? - Yeah. - He's fine. I'm going to get some water, would you like... We're fine. Leave us alone. It's a long flight to Brussels, so I suggest everyone rest. Osman and Jakub will be distributing dinner shortly. So what did Laura want you to tell us? People are complaining about the taste of the food we got in Canada. I said the same. - I was eating an apple, it tasted like... - Nothing? - You could say that. - Like I was telling Laura... I think that's because it was nothing. I mean, whatever's happening with the sun is causing that, too. Causing what, food to rot? If an increase in ionising radiation is causing this sun problem, for whatever reason, it's killing people by modifying their atomic structure. It's causing a breakdown of their molecules. I'm completely lost. Their DNA. It's scrambling the food's DNA. Then why not just say that? Sorry. Fresh food might no longer have any nutritional value. That can't be good. Oh, yeah? You think? The canned stuff seems fine, for now. - I'm not sure about anything else we find. - Great. Now we're going to starve! Right. Inventory any good food we have left from Brussels. Good idea. But keep this conversation between us. - We don't want any more fights. - Sure. I'll come help soon. I need a word with Mathieu. It never ends. Shit plane. We should switch in Brussels. Mathieu, if we're going to work together, we need to trust each other, right? Yes. For a while now, you've seemed... You've not been yourself. Plenty of reasons for that: frustration, fatigue. But I can't help if you don't talk to me. Chloé... the stewardess... Who we left in Brussels? We were close. Chloé was pregnant. You wanted honesty, didn't you? Osman? I wanted to thank you for speaking up. It's nice to know we have a good Muslim aboard. I'm sorry if my actions gave you the wrong idea. I hate what that man did, but I don't like you either. You're an ignorant pig. You're my hero. I don't like bullies. - I can do that. - No, don't worry. Just trying to pitch in without Gabrielle. She was nice. Did you know her? From the airport? Sadly, cabin crew don't hang out with cleaners. What did you do before? Before Belgium, I mean. In Morocco? My family had a restaurant. - I was a tour guide. - Oh, yeah? I love Moroccan food. Me, too. Think they're making us a tagine? Insh'allah! - We are going to starve? - Shh. We don't want the others to panic. He didn't say we'd "starve." What's going on? Book club. Get out. I need to use the toilet. Use the one at the front. Go on. Out, out, out. You're the only one he listens to. I raised three brothers, I know how to handle... What is it? Just the thought of going back. I'm not sure I can. Excuse me. Going back will affect everyone differently. Yeah. What food do you miss most from Brussels? For me, it's mussels. There'll be no more mussels. - I know. - Horst said nothing fresh! - Even then, we aren't sure. - I know that, Sylvie. I was just chatting. Beneath my apartment, there was a kosher Mongolian butcher. There was a what? Towards the end, Henri was eating almost nothing. He said nothing tasted right. But that shop made this marinated beef. Henri loved it right until the end. Yeah. Mongolian beef, that's what I miss most. Attention, passengers, we have a little problem, but stay seated, I'll solve it. Thank you. What's going on? - What was that? - Altimeter. We're flying too high. What is "too high"? Above the birds... of course. Who do we think we are? You must be overdue for a break. Want to take five? No, I'm fine. Horst said he needs to talk to you. What for? I don't know. It's probably about the food. My stomach still hurts. Go see him, I've got this. Can't he come here? I am the captain, aren't I? - I'll be back in a sec, okay? - Yeah. Rik, Ayaz, come here. - What's up? - We have a problem. - Everything still okay? - It's so fucking hot. I'm so fed up. I fucking swear to you. This piece of shit plane. It's causing trouble? It's hot. Why is it so hot? How you doing, Mathieu? That's not Horst. - What are you up to? - Okay, now! Hey... Ayaz! Stop! Get your hands off me! - Don't hurt him! - Let me go! I'm the captain! Get off me! Get off him! - We're trying to help him. - What's going on? - Let me go. - What's wrong with him? Wait. - You need to rest. - I know. Christ! I was just a bit too hot. I'm too hot. - You okay, Mathieu? - Yes! Sure. I just need to splash some water on my face. On my face. He needs to sleep. He's only slept ten hours since we left Brussels. Hang on. There's something on the radio. - What is that, Morse code? - Of course not. Even on cocaine you couldn't type that fast. It sounds like packet data. Like what? When machines communicate with each other. - A satellite? - Possibly. That's a person. What language is that? It sounds like... Russian? What's he saying? No idea. My dad prohibited anything Soviet in my house. Actually, Soviet or American. - He hated everyone. - Shh. - That woman, the Russian... - Zara. Yeah, go get her. The stones that man swallowed... how did you get them? - I stole them. - For money? Why do you care? My son likes you. He looks up to you. So, before breaking the truth to him, I'd like to know if I was wrong about you. It wasn't about money. I planned to send them back to Turkey, anonymously. My mother would've been proud... I think. Too hard to believe? I think I believe you. - This time, anyway. - Why? You'll do anything to survive. That doesn't mean you're a bad person. Is Dominik any better? He's sleeping, which is good. We're running out of his medicine. I'm hoping we can get more in Brussels. Excuse me, Zara. - Can you help us translate something? - Yes. It is Russian, right? Yes, but the accent isn't Russian. Ukrainian maybe. What's he saying? Star... Stara 17. Stara 17? Never heard of it. - Stara like "star" in English? - Shh. "Sunrise... dawn... star." - He's talking about the sun. - Makes sense. No, not the actual sun. He's talking about a place in space. Shit, he's in space. Holy shit, the ISS. The International Space Station. The modules are named like that. - An astronaut. - A cosmonaut. We must be above the ISS to Russian Control relay. No one was replying. - He's gone? - We must've passed the relay. Stuck up there? We thought we had it bad. - How is he still alive? - That's a good question. Maybe it'll help us solve this thing. How fast does the ISS fly? I don't know. Fast. Look, we have to tell Mathieu about this. That Mars Sphere thing - was never completed. - What? What is it? Ines was reading an article about the... Mars dome thing. - Mars Sphere. - It was never completed. The other plane... they're fucked, and they don't even know. Good thing we didn't go. The NATO-Terenzio thing is all we have left. There was a cosmonaut on the radio. - I don't know that joke. - No, really. We don't know what it means, but thought we should tell Mathieu, record the coordinates. Wait... Wasn't Mathieu with you? Anyone seen Mathieu? - He's not in the cockpit? - No. - Down the hole? - No, we were there. - What's going on? - Seen Mathieu? Has anyone? Did he come out of the bathroom? - It's locked! - Move. Fuck! Fever, low blood pressure, shallow breathing. He needs oxygen. What can we do? I'm not a doctor! Yes, but among us, you're the closest we have. I'm not sure, but in training we learned how bed sores can get infected. They can cause sepsis. Sepsis? Blood poisoning from the infected wounds. Mathieu... The gunshot! Hmm? - It causes hallucinations? - Maybe. I think so. "Symptoms include delirium, elevated heart rate, breathing difficulties and confusion." It makes sense. What can we do? I can give him what's left of the antibiotics, but we have to amputate the infected tissue. Ayaz has a knife. This is no time for jokes! Can you do it here? Here? Are you joking? He needs a sterile operating theatre, surgical instruments, IV fluids and probably a respirator. - Okay, when we land... - Who's going to do it? I'm not a surgeon! My hands are shaking at the thought. - Well, I believe in you. - Stop your smooth talk. This is a real problem. We can't solve it now, anyway. We'll figure it out in Brussels. Period. How will we get there? How will we land without a pilot? Sylvie. She can land the plane. She can, right? No way! I can engage or disengage autopilot, adjust the flaps and rudder. But there's a whole landing sequence I'd never seen before all this. So you have seen it? I've seen a man hit a target at 200 metres. That doesn't make me a sniper! What if you watched online videos? Online videos? - Are you for real? - It's not so crazy. You can do it. I'll help you. What choice do we have? If the weather's good and the plane behaves, there's a slight chance, very slight, I'll get us to the ground. That's right. Good. But there's no way I can take off. It's ten times more complex. Mathieu's the only one who can do it before the sun rises. Laura needs to know that. She needs to know that if I manage to land, all our lives are in her hands. Okay. I'll tell her. Sylvie says we're about to land, buckle up. Things were tense, Rik. I didn't finish what I was saying. What, that I'm too weak to help you? Rik, you're a paragon of morality. That's paramount in a military manoeuvre. You have to come with us to NATO, hmm? You're just saying that so I don't turn on you. Not at all. We'll need every bit of skill and luck we have... to succeed on this mission. Okay. You can count on me. Set the speed to 209 knots. Okay, speed at 209. Set the flap to one. Flaps to one. I can't believe we're doing this. Landing For Dummies, seriously? If we survive, I'll leave a good review. You see it? - What are we looking for? - Something big. What's that? The Atomium. We're close. Who gives a fuck? He touched something. Maybe just the throttle? No, he's disengaging the AP. Shit! No, that's not it. Okay. It's okay. Now, set flaps to two. - Flaps at two. - Speed to 180 knots. You realise that's based on a different airport and weather conditions? I didn't want to say, but, yes. It's an example of landing in Buenos Aires. Fuck. Jakub, this can't be happening! - We're not going to make it! - Calm down! You're handling it. If this doesn't work, I don't know, we'll just go land in Buenos Aires, okay? Okay, Buenos Aires, great idea. There it is! Shit, planes on the runway! Open the throttle again. We'll do a quick flyby. Engines seizing. Okay, forget the flyby. - What? - We can't risk it. What's next? - 2,500. - Gear down. What the hell is wrong with this engine? It's stopped. - Flaps to three. - Flaps to three. Shit! You're losing it! I'm not losing it! Open the throttle! I'll land on the tarmac. What's next? Flaps to full. Okay, flaps to full! What if there are obstacles on the tarmac? We'll hit them. One thousand. It's okay! Let me help you! Come on! You okay? Three hundred. It's like we're out of fuel. No, fuel's fine. Minimum 200. - It'll be too short. It's too short! - No, I know, I know. Tell everyone to brace themselves. - I'm gonna cut engine two. - What? One hundred. Brace yourselves! - We are not crashing! - 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10. Retard. Retard. We did it. You did it. You landed the plane, Sylvie! You did it. Great job! - Nicely done, Sylvie! - Bravo, Jakub! You deserve it. Bravo, Sylvie! - Bravo! - Okay. We have two and a half hours before sunrise, and a million things to do first. You are going to the hospital and doing the operation. - I'll need help. - Of course. Can we come? I need to find more medicine for Dominik. Okay. Osman? You know the airport. - You and Ines can grab some food. - Okay. I'll stay here, try to figure out why the engines were seizing up. - Ayaz? Go to NATO with Terenzio? - Sure. Rik's coming, too. I can try to help you with the engine, even if I don't know much... I don't know what the problem is. Maybe the fuel pump. It was like the fuel wasn't running. Oh, shit. - What? - What? No, I don't know. Maybe it's nothing. Oh, no. What now? We don't have time. What is it? Fuel is carbon-based, organic... like the food. The fuel's gone bad, too? That's not good. I'm not sure that's what it is, but it would make sense. How can we fly without fuel? We have to take off, right? What are we going to do? What are you going to do? Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
