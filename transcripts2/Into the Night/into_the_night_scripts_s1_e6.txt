 If you want to start her, you have to stick it in. Sergeant Ricci. Where are we going, Major? Well, I... I don't know... You're the boss, right? Yeah. Affirmative. You certainly showed Ayaz who was in charge. - That was an accident. I... - Was it? Don't apologise for being strong. - I'm sorry... - What did I say?

 Okay, okay. That hurts! Because you're weak, Terenzio. All in favour of banishing Terenzio? Hey, fuck you! Fuck you. Open. So what have you found? The good news is the coordinates that Rik wrote down... That's all the generals said, Sylvie. The coordinates Rik wrote down at NATO correspond on maps to a hydroelectric dam in the Stara district. That would make sense. Yes, if the Soviets were building a secret bunker a long time ago, a dam... The security of a dam, that would be a great way to hide a bunker. If the bunker is under the reservoir, that would protect us from the sun.

 Okay. That's the good news. What's the bad? Hey! Very good. - You can hand the food out. - Hang on, I'm dying for a piss. "Dying for a piss," is that how young ladies talk these days? "Young ladies"? No idea. Anyone in there? Did Ayaz come out? - Everything okay in there? - Hold on! Just a moment. Okay, so, the longitude/latitude coordinates Rik heard... - It's all they said! - Nobody's blaming you. There are only two decimal places. Horst says that's about 250 metres in each direction. But that's not a problem if we know what to look for, - if we have a description or... - But we don't. - We don't. - We don't. I trained soldiers in reconnaissance. I can find the bunker. You've "helped" us enough. Shut up. I'll let Mathieu know. You keep searching online. Try to find out exactly where it is. They've kept this place secret for 60, 70 years, and you think we can find it from just a few pictures on the web? We'd better. Because if we don't, we're dead. We'll land at an air force base 15 kilometres from the bunker. In Belarus? - In Bulgaria. - Where's that? - Next to Turkey. - Does it matter? What matters... is that we'll only have 30 minutes to get from the air base to the bunker before sunrise. How are we going to get there? - Dominik can't walk far. - Yes, I can! We're landing in an air base. There'll be vehicles. - And if there aren't? - I'll carry him. - We won't have time. - Then we'll... We have to... - Even if we run... - Enough! Mathieu may see it as his job to encourage you, protect you, but it's not my job and I'm not a leader. I'm just here to tell you that if this bunker doesn't work out, we won't have enough fuel or time for a plan B. So, when we land, everyone be ready to go. The dam may be lit up. If we do a flyby, we may be able to see it. We'll be lucky to make it to the airbase. Headwinds. We should've gotten more fuel. Jakub said he filled the truck. We should've taken two. You did well, Sylvie. You did everything you could. It wasn't enough. We've no time for you to feel sorry for yourself. I'm not, okay? I... I just feel sorry for them. Those people are grateful to you. You're a leader. Right... Why the air force didn't see that, I'll never know. I told you I was kicked out, but I wasn't. What? Can I have a word? - Sure. - Away from Dominik. Nobody can carry anyone for 15 kilometres in so little time. You'll figure something out. You're tough. You don't need me to tell you that. Who stared Terenzio down earlier without any fear? I need to tell you something. I had surgery about a month ago. I'm not one to judge. No, not that. I needed money for Dominik's treatment. I sold a kidney. They told me I was the right size, I was healthy, drug-free... They gave me 15,000 euros. Now I can see why you were so upset we didn't go to Moscow. That wasn't about me. It's never been about me. You need to know Dominik isn't the only one who's weak. I don't think I can run far either. Then I'll carry you, too. No, that's not what I'm asking you. If I can't keep up, I want you to promise... that you'll carry my son. I will. I'll do it. You can count on me. I know. Sorry to interrupt. Ayaz... can we have a quick chat? We barely saw each other for the first eight months. He was stationed in Mali. I was in Afghanistan. Then we were both stationed in Belgium. And it was... One day, he started complaining... about being tired and losing weight. I told him not to worry. I kept teasing him, telling him he never should've dated a girl four years younger than him. He ignored the pain for weeks because of me. Pancreatic cancer. It ate him up inside. I quit the day after he died. I'm the last person anyone should ever listen to. I'm sorry for your loss. I really am. But... I think that in my entire life... that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. You have to forgive yourself. Shit. If this is the end, you're gonna die thinking that? There's not many places we can get a bit of privacy. You could go below with Terenzio. - I should be down there. - What? In fact, I should be down there, with him. Ayaz... I need you to forgive me for abandoning you at NATO. Terenzio told you I'd already left. - How could you know? - I saw you. On the computer monitor. It was just for a second, I wasn't sure, but... Why didn't you say anything? I guess that if you had been dead, I wouldn't have had to face you again... after having tried to banish you from the plane. I forgive you, Rik. Huh? - Just like that? - Isn't that what you want? Well, yes, but... "an eye for an eye." - What? - We have to even the score. You have to hurt me. - Rik... - No, I'm serious. Hurt me back. Twenty years ago, I went to prison. I insisted that my wife and kids didn't visit. But I promised them... that when I got out, we'd continue like nothing had happened. Three years later, I walked out of that prison and never went home again. And now, I never can. It takes courage to face your mistakes and you've just done that. Let's just agree to move on, okay? Okay. Agreed. Since we're confessing, I also lied about why I was going to Russia. It wasn't for a security conference. I'd met a woman online. Yes, it's embarrassing, I know. Why is it embarrassing? Well... maybe it isn't. Did you love her? Well, it didn't last long, but she was everything I was looking for. She was kind, honourable, a hard worker. She owned her own nail salon. - She is beautiful. - Yes, she is beautiful. We're landing soon. You guys gonna help or... are you buying earrings? What? That's an earrings advert. I've actually met that model a few times. A total train wreck. Thanks, Ines. What's up with him? Everyone, to maximise our time on the ground, we're making a faster descent. Once we're on the ground, we'll skip searching for stairs and exit via the cargo bay. That means leaving via the hole cut into the avionics bay. What will I do for my breathing? We can't take any luggage. You can bring your concentrator. No exceptions. We don't have time. We're all in the same boat. Fuel. - He said, "Bring nothing." - I know. But a special boy gets a special exception. Okay? We'll make it. We're running on fumes, but we'll make it. I'll speak to you soon. Once we land, I won't be able to move as fast... I'll be there to help you. So will Horst, Jakub... You'll need to help the weaker passengers. - But... - I'm not saying I'm giving up. But I need you to promise that if I slow you down, - you'll leave me... - Don't think about it. I have to think about it. I've no idea what awaits us. - You have to promise. - Stop. If you don't, I may as well... - crash the plane. - What? If I'm going to kill everyone, I should make it fast. Okay, fine. But it won't happen. I'll be back. Ayaz? Rik? - Are we synchronised for remaining time? - Thirty-nine minutes. - Check. - Likewise. And the location? Ayaz and I both have directions to the dam. One last thing. To go through the avionics bay, we have to pass Terenzio. What do we do with him? If it were up to me? I'd leave him down there. He's had plenty of chances to prove he's not an arsehole. - He's failed every time. - And he's dangerous. I think it's up to Ayaz. It's you he tried to kill. I don't know. I don't know what's in the next life, but if we're going there today, I don't want my last action to be sentencing someone to death. Okay. But the handcuffs stay on. It's one thing to forgive, it's another thing entirely to forget. What did Jakub say about the bunker? Last I checked, they'd found nothing specific. One problem at a time. Passengers of Flight 21, we'll be landing in a moment. Remember, we have just 30 minutes, so bring nothing that would slow you down. Everything will be all right. I promise. You hear me? Once we find vehicles, we'll divide into groups, and then find the bunker... or at least try our best. I take comfort in knowing that wherever we end up, we'll end up there together. Isn't that a Globemaster? - It is indeed. - That's a good sign. At least we know we're at the right airport. Okay, split into two groups. Everyone hear that? Not a second to spare. - Who has the key to the cuffs? - Who cares? They're staying on. Don't forget to check the fuel gauge. You don't look well. Nor do you, but that's nothing new. Guess I shouldn't complain, with you being the bigger man and not leaving me here, huh? I wasn't the one who said we should save you. It was Ayaz. The man you left for dead. What time do you have? Thirty-four minutes. And a full tank of fuel! - You? - Same here. Worry about yourself. I'm not doing it for me. The idea that you'll have to say a mechanic saved a pilot's life gives me the will to live. Come on! Let's go! - You know the way? - Got it right here. Everyone in? Okay! If we don't meet again, you did a great job. Thank you. - Can you see them? - Yeah. But I lose sight of them on the corners. Three more kilometres. No mobile reception. - Fuck, damn it! - What? - Nothing. - That's "nothing"? We were in such a hurry, since we said no bags... I forgot Henri's ashes. We'll go back for them after finding the bunker, as soon as it's dark again. - Yeah, we will. - Okay. Can you sit still? I'd like to see you try to keep your balance while wearing handcuffs. - I bet you would! - Laura, leave him be. As if I think of you that way! How could you have time... between trying to kill people and sleeping with Ines? Sleep with who? - I've seen you drool over her. - Laura, please. Putting aside the kind of guy you are, she's half your age. Less of an age gap than the guy you were with. - Why are you fighting? - He was my employer. - Your employer. Yeah, right. - Why don't you get out here? Nobody wants you here. You've been nothing but trouble. Trouble? Like when I saved your life? What? You only saved us 'cause we were already on board. Right, yeah. Besides, did you ever think maybe we didn't want saving? Huh? Maybe some of us would have preferred staying with our families. All good? So far. Do you have a signal? How much time left? No. Too rural. - Twenty-four minutes to sunrise. - Okay. What should we be looking for? Huh? Any unusual formation... What? - Mum! - What's wrong? - Ayaz? - Ayaz! - Ayaz? - Mum! - Ayaz? - Ayaz, look out! - Ayaz! - Watch where you're going! I haven't seen them in a while. Maybe slow down. They know the way! This is where the road splits. Just one more kilometre. Good. Great. - Which way, again? - Right. My head. - We've gotta get out! - Okay. Let's move! - What happened? - No idea. Dominik! My fucking head! - What happened? - No idea, he just froze. You okay, Ayaz? It happened again? What do you mean, "again"? Wake up. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, baby? Can you hear me? We'll discuss it en route, but by the sounds of that, - we'll have to go by foot. - What? - Start the engine! - No, it won't move. We'll have to walk. - Are you crazy? - No time to argue. Let's go. Come on! We have to go now. Come on! The gate is open! Eighteen minutes until sunrise! Hey, the gate! Stop! - What? - The gate. Stop! What happened? We have to keep it open for the others. Let's pull it off its tracks! My God! Don't touch anything, it's electrified! Osman, wake up! We have to get it open! - There must be some controls. - Osman! Osman! - Let me do it. - After what you told me? - You said I was tough! - Yeah. You're in no shape to carry anyone. Someone should carry you. Have you had that long? Since yesterday. Just a couple of times. I'm gonna kill Terenzio. Ayaz! - Go on. - Let's go. Which way? Call the others. No signal. - Oh, shit! - Think, Ayaz. - You don't remember, do you? - Right, I think. - You think? - Or maybe left... - What do we do? - Choose a path. - I can't remember. - Do you feel like it's this way? - I'm sorry. - There's no point pressuring him. We don't have long, though! - Left. - Left? - Left, I think. - Okay. - Let's go. No time to argue. - How much time do we have? - Sylvie said 35 minutes, right? - It was 25! Okay. Might as well all go together... Come on. He still has a pulse, but it's weak. You did it. Okay, let's go. - How's Osman? - Unconscious, but I've got a pulse. Let's put him in the back. What's going on? - Shit! You have to hold the button. - We can't jam it? It's a security mechanism. It's there to stop people doing what we're doing. So, what do we do? Park the Jeep across it? The others won't fit. It'll be electrified. We've only got 16 minutes! 16 minutes! How would we find the bunker on foot? How would we move him? I'll press it. The button, I'll do it. Once they're here, I'll hop in their Jeep. You don't have to. They'll only be a few minutes. I'll jump in with them. That should absolve me. Okay. Unlock his cuffs. Okay. We'll park by the bunker entrance, if we find it. So just look for the Jeep. Sounds like a plan. You guys load Osman up. Give me the key. You abandoned Ayaz, now you save Ayaz, and you're even, right? Rik said God forgives those who repent. Give me your wrist. Thank you. Hey! What are you doing? If all you want is to save yourself, how can we trust you to stay and save the others? They'll unlock you. Know what you are? Yes. A leader. A bitch! You're a bitch! There's a fence! There's a chain on it. It looks locked. - Where's the entrance? - There isn't one. It was the wrong way. Let's turn around and go back, then! Shit. No steering wheel. There's no time, anyway. So, what? You want to climb the fence? I'll go first. I'll put my shirt on the fence. Ayaz, stop! The fence, it's electrified. It says on that sign. - Fuck! What can we do? - Let's go back! No! Wait. The sun is going to rise. Give me a second to think. Nine minutes and 45 seconds. Sun can't be much longer. Trucks from the airport. That's promising, yeah? Yeah, that's it. You're right. The others should see us parked here. What's that? A vent. That's a good sign! There are some stairs over here. Hurry up, Ayaz! Come on. Okay, listen carefully. It's simple. It's science. As long as we stand on something non-conductive... and we don't touch wires of the opposite polarity at the same time, we can climb the fence. We can't. The sun's about to come up. Just do something! So, how do we do it? How do we ground ourselves? Those tyres. If we get them off, we can stand on them. - Rubber's a great barrier. - How do we get them off? Find a jack! We'll cover that razor wire with shirts and jackets. A door! Careful! It might be electrified. There's no time. Locked! Try and find something to break the lock. Come on, Ayaz! Careful, careful. Drop it. Be careful. Okay. See how I'm never touching two wires at the same time? Got it? One by one. Here. - Slowly. - Okay, guys. There you go. Stop! Wait a second! Hit inwards or you'll break the lock. Come on, let's go. - What are you doing? - I'll wait for the others. You can't! Rik, how long till sunrise? - Three minutes and 27 seconds. - I'll be back in time. - How will you know? - Go! That's an order. Piece of shit! You're a piece of shit! Come on! Over here! Sylvie! - Come on! - All right! - Where are the others? - Inside. Where's Terenzio? - Wasn't he with you? - No. Inside, quickly! - What happened to your clothes? - Long story. Ayaz. At least let me help you. Okay. Dominik. All right then! Give me your best! I'm not scared. I'm ready. Ready for whatever you've got. Bastards! - Where are the others? - I don't know. There's a door. We're nearly there. Oh! Back up! Who is Sylvie? Me. They said you were in charge. Yes. Where are the others? Inside. Where is the Italian soldier? He's not here? No. - I heard you could use some rest. - Yes. You won't get any here. Come on. - There they are. - They made it! It's a miracle! What are you all doing? Your pilot told us you all spent last week running for your lives. Yes. Well... We're gonna solve the problem. But we need your help. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
