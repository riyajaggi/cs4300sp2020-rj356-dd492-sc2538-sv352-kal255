 They're early tonight.. It's the flight backs that  interests me Major Brandt. When they fall out of the sky. You are surely not going hunting yourself? Is there any reason why I shouldn't? Oh, no, but isn't there a saying about  having a dog and barking oneself? I do not bark, Major Brandt. I bite. I don't know you very well yet, but I suspect there is one significant difference difference between us. My work matters to me. There will be 5 airmen from Liege and  3 from Hamme. They'll arrive tomorrow afternoon. - Where will you put them? There's no room.

 Sorry, I'm late, everyone. There's been another curfew check.They're becoming very thorough. We must be so careful. We have a problem Yvette. There are eight airmen arriving tomorrow. Three from Hamme, five from Liège.. And we have no room. What do we do? This is stupidly dangerous. There are too many and there has been no time to teach them anything. They will look and behave like English schoolboys. - We've no alternative. Philippe cannot keep them while the Gestapo searches continue. He must hand them on down the line. I'll ask the Doctor Keldermans to take three of them. Sometimes his German officer patients make it possible for him not to be searched. The others can go to MalibranStraat.. - I'll go and see ... No, that you stay here and take messages. I'll go and see the doctor and then go on to the market and talk to Alain.  Now Jacques, when you meet these people, try to make them understand the dangers. Try to give them the basics. Change the way they walk, behave.

 Give them a few words of French. Anything. Candide. Of course, I have no rooms. Even the Carlton is full. It's not possible. - Sanctuary. Try Sanctuary. I'm sorry. Goodbye. That was Natalie. Another two. If you have any more trouble come and see me again. Auf wiedersehen, Herr Major Schmidt. Lisa, my dear forgive me. Now, what's the problem? There are three children coming from Hamme. I have no one to take them on. Could you keep them here for four days? - Let's see. Yes, the Sturmdattenführer comes to see me on Thursdays That should preclude any search. Yes. I'll take them. Four days you say. Good. - Thank you,Pascal. I can't stay. There's too much to do. Forgive me? Er, Lisa, before you go, you must warn your uncle to be very careful. I hear there's a suspicion in the ministry about ration cards. One of my patients talking. I don't imagine it's gone beyond suspicion, but, please warn him. - Yes I will. And Lisa, you needn't to come to work for the next few days. I can manage. Thank you, Pascal. Goodbye. - Goodbye. That's the place. You will be collected by a man introducing himself as Jacques. It is important you do everything he says. Sorry, we had no time to prepare you. We must just hope for the best. You are supposed to be workers, so try and pretend you are tired. Once you're inside, say nothing. Do not sit stiff like a dummy. Try and relax. Alright? Relax. Let's go. For God's sake eat the bread. Look how the others eat it and do the same. Is that your contribution to the war effort? You charge them half what you charge us. They give me coffee, nylons, soap.. All you offer me is paper money. You want something for nothing? Not with Lalie. I'm going next door to make a telephone call. Just relax and you'll be alright. I should have kept my uniform on. They can shoot us. as spies now we're in civvies. Shut up.. - But they can. Shut up.. For God's sake, Mike. Drink your bloody beer. I knew you'd come back. What have you brought? They're chocolates. Chocolates... What do we do now? - We're going upstairs. Where are you going now? What's up? Mike, for God's sake, wake up. Yes, Robert, Monique is getting your soup now. Here we are. Rabbit soup. And before you start complaining, there's no rabbit in it. - Why not? Couldn't get any. I could only get the bones. It is rationed you know. You're lucky to get the stew. Lisa, if you're staying for a while, do you want something to eat? That was Claude. At the Bistro. Two Germans arrived. The children panicked and made a dash for it. - And Claude? Oh, he got away. - Are they still together? No. Two dead. The other, Sergeant Walker, is still on the run. Albert. Have you telephone token. - Yes, of course, Lisa...There. - Thank you. Well, our people will just have to find him. - Let's hope so. I only have one pair of hands. Hello Jacques. I'm told the dogs have broken loose. Two have now been caught, but the third is still on the run. Yes. About 2 kilometers southeast of Asse. Yes, the police are helping in the search. Thank you. Lisa, coffee? Monique, coffee, please. I called Jacques. - There's one other thing... ...Curtis. He's been seen with Dirk Maes and Thierry. That doesn't prove anything. - But they're communists. It proves he has to be watched. We don't know enough. Alain has double checked with London. He is cleared. They ask for our cooperation. I still don't like it. Albert? How much does this Walker know? I don't know. We must wait and see. No, I don't think we can just wait. Monique, I want you to try and find Claude. Tell him we must know who Sergeant Walker's been in contact with. More problems? - You wanted to see me? London requests us to work with you Mr Curtis. We will try to do that. It's meant to be helpful to both of us. - That is not certain yet. And I suppose the money I brought over wasn't welcome? - Yes, it is welcome. Mr Curtis, let me make one thing very clear. We have been running an evasion line for some time already. So have others.  Now we've managed to find money before, and we will do so again, if necessary. That money. And it's a very great deal,  was given freely and willingly by hundreds of people who could ill afford it. It was given by people who merely believe in freedom and the Allied cause. Never forget that. - I was not about to. London only wishes to help. We'll get nowhere until that is understood. And you will get nowhere unless you understand that we will not accept help from London  unless we still retain our freedom of action. We will keep you as a commercial traveller. It'll be easier for moving about.  For now you are the Brussels representative of the Strebelle Chemical Company of Antwerp with responsibilities for France and Switzerland. These letters confirm. Oh, you have a reserved occupation and you will be expected to do some work for the company. Where do you get these? Are they forged? - No, they're genuine. Here's your ration card. Mr. Moreels. - Thank you Alain. Let's get down to business. Yes, yes I quite agree. Now I have here a list of civilian suspects. I would be most grateful if you could tell me if any of the names appear on your list. I will certainly check up. If I may have a private word. Sir, they have captured an RAF flyer. Rennert. I want to see him as soon as he's brought in. And I do not want the Luftwaffe to know he's here until I'm finished with him. Understood? - Sir. I must act as liaison between London and the evasion lines from over here. Now Rene Thierry will help you move some of the men. You're in a crisis. But he is a communist. - It doesn't matter a damn what their politics are. Not yet. - Quite a tall order, Mr Curtis.  Are you and London not presuming rather a lot? If you call some real cooperation towards winning this war, "presuming", then you're damn right we're presuming.  We need every pilot, navigator, gunner we can get. They take too long to train. We want them back. London will supply radios, guns, explosives. Anything you want. - No. You misunderstand. We are not a resistance organization. We do not blow up bridges and kill Germans. That is not our purpose and we do not intend it should become our purpose. Now, if that is why London has sent to you, then you have come to the wrong door. I have no intention of turning you into saboteurs. Nor has London. But I do know that from time to time you need guns and ammunition. You would supply them? - We would from London, - But we could not rely on that. No, we take German guns and German bullets as we need them.  - What about radios? We are better with our own make or German issue. The parts are available here?  The Gestapo have arrested the British sergeant from Hamme. He's with Kessler. What does he know? - He knows Claude and Alain. He knows the house at Hamme and he knows the collecting routine. That's about 17 people if he talks. They have been trained. - Trained?! They are children. They are irresponsible. They either panic at the first sight of a German uniform, or they treat the whole thing as a game. Did he know who he was to contact here? - Of course not, but he had a telephone number of someone. A school friend I think. Apparently they had to stop him ringing up to say hello. Trained!...Albert. Get a message to Hamme and Antwerp. I'll be at the Candide. - You'll be alright? - Of course, yes. Now, Natalie. Alert, Philipe and Claude. They must disappear. Is there anything I can do? - We will contact you if we need you. Now Jacques, you must keep watching Walker. Since you were shot down, you have been collected and taken care of. You have been moved from the area around Antwerp and brought here to Brussels. By whom? Dressed as you are I can have your shot as a spy. If you cooperate and you will be interned and treated well. I'm not a spy. I've still got my identity disc. You don't appear to have it anymore, Sergeant. I told you all I know about the squadron. - Yes, and it's excellent information. But it's not what I want. Ultimately, everyone talks. It's only a question of time. Just write down everything that's happened to you since you arrived in Belgium. Names, addresses, codewords. Anything you remember? Smoke if you wish. It will help you to remember. Sir, the Obersturmbannführer... Alert the guard. - Wissen. Guards, guards.. Guards.. How did you get from Antwerp to Brussels? I want to know who helped you. I want...Quiet Sir, his back is broken. He must go to hospital. - Silence I want to know the names of all your contacts. I want to know their names. I want to know their names. Sergeant. Sergeant Walker  - Stop that. What the hell do you think you're doing? I am questioning a prisoner of war. One who has come down part of the escape line we are both so anxious to find. Sturman, you bring a stretcher. You take this man to the entrance. You, go to the main desk and tell them to send for an ambulance. I am questioning this man. I want this man in the hospital. Now! Wait. Yes. Yes. No, no. I quite understand. Well, I'm most grateful to you sister, goodbye. Is it possible to get Walker out?  - No. It can only be done by the Germans themselves. He's guarded by the Luftwaffe Polizei. No, it's not possible. - How long before he's able to walk? Without seeing the X-ray plates, I can only guess, but from what the sister implied it'll be three or four weeks at least. And then, only on crutches. And all that time he's being interrogated. - Yes. Pascal? If it were to become necessary to get someone into the hospital, could you arrange it? Lisa. The Gestapo are just waiting to pounce. Remember when coffee actually tasted like coffee? First thing I served you with in here. Cup of black coffee without sugar. Is that the first time you saw me? - Yes. Can you really remember that? - Yes. Seems a long time ago. You tired? Why don't you go up to my room and lie down? I'll do the washing up. We won't open again for a couple of hours.  Coming up? - When I've done this. Andrée. Oh my God. You'd think she'd heard us. It isn't easy for her. - Nor for me Albert. I've got to go up to her. She hasn't much to live for. She needs me. So do I. Where's Albert? Albert. Alain's here for you. I don't know if he's a he's a fool or a saint. I wouldn't do it. Not after the way she treats him. Are you enjoying that beer? I suppose there's a problem. We never see you on Sunday without trouble. This came for Yvette. - She's gone visiting. Thierry will cope with the ones in the North. Thank God. And the Strasburg group will take the remaining 7 into Switzerland. Good. Alain. See Claude yourself. Tell him I want them moved tonight, before curfew.  I'll get her a message.  - Right. What about a little brandy? - We're not open. Alain, go. You know I think you will be happier in here now that your taking notice again.  Let me introduce you. This is Flight Sergeant Pickering.  - Hello He was shot down two weeks ago. Is everything alright Pickering? Yes thank you Sir.  - Good, and this is Sergeant Child. Hello - Another flak casualty. Now, I'm arranging for you to visit a Belgian specialist, day after tomorrow. He's not a consultant, so we have to go to him. But he is the...best in the field. Thank you Sir. You're very kind. How old are you? Sergeant - Twenty sir. You are much too young to lose the use of your legs. But it will need all your, your guts and determination. You realize that? I'm not sure I have very much. Guts, I mean. Any man who throws himself down a stairwell rather than talk is not without courage in my estimation. You still feel nothing? - No sir, but it's starting to itch. That's a good sign. Hello. Donald Pickering. - Michael Walker. Where were you shot down? - Somewhere over Essen. You? Flak on the way home. Just about over the Belgian border. Started to lose height and some lousy night fighters closed in and that was it. I'm lucky to have made it. How long have you been here? Five weeks, they tell me. I was unconscious most of the time. It's all a bit unreal. What do you make of that fellow Brandt? Oh, he's a good type for a German. He's been damn decent to me. I suppose there's good and bad on both sides. - I wouldn't trust him. Which squadron were you with? Somewhere up North. - How long have you been here? Seems like forever. Is it really true that you tried to commit suicide rather than talk? - Yes Brave chap. Yes, well... I could use a pee. Watch what you're saying. I'm not sure about that bloke. Won't keep you a minute. 1938. You are Jacques Bol, am I correct? - Yes, that's me. I've always been interested in athletics. You had an accident as I remember. Yes, I broke my hip. I don't cycle any more. How unfortunate. So this is your place of employment? This is my shop. Can I get you anything?  Oh no, no, no. I just wanted to see the man who won the 50 kilometer race at Wuppertal. Now gently take the weight. Gently. Good, and the other leg forward. Excellent. And again. Come on. And again. Careful... Good, that's enough. Now my young friend, sit. Will I able to walk properly eventually? - As long as you take it easy. A little practice, a little rest,  gradually increasing the time and distance. Undue strain will harm it. With care you should walk small distances quite quickly. I'll not be going anywhere for a long time. Take a few moments rest while I go and see that your two guards are being looked after properly in the kitchen. You're making very good progress. - Where's my escort? They're enjoying hot soup in the kitchen and the company of my rather attractive maid. Why should they worry about a cripple? He's not likely to go anywhere? Is he? So you come and see me again next week monsieur. In the meantime, keep trying.  Keep trying a little each day. Now my receptionist has telephoned for the ambulance to take you back. It will only be a few minutes. Quickly Jacques, anything else? Yes. My girlfriend's an orderly at the hospital. She told me that Walker has been moved to another ward with two other RAF men. Do we know of any other airmen at the hospital? - I know of one. Not two. Jacques, tell your girlfriend to keep her eyes open. And you watch this Walker on his visit to Doctor Bogaerde. We might just be able to pick him up. - They're next door. We'll go out the back. Left leg's painful? Try twisting the foot outwards, so, keep it straight. Come to me. This is better I think. - Much better. I can just about take some weight on it you know. - You could even walk a short distance? I could try. Excuse me please for a moment. Good morning Herr Major. Herr Sturmbannführer. - Where is Sergeant Walker? Sergeant Walker, on my authority is being treated by an outside specialist. I think we owe him that, don't you? In all your consideration for his welfare, I hope you have not forgotten that I am to interrogate him. Not at all. If you care to wait, he will be returning at any moment now. But Sergeant Walker has been interrogated. Of course, you don't know Lieutenant Knebel I think. Of the Luftwaffe Polizei. Knebel. - Sturmbannführer. - Will you please divulge what you have already learned from Walker? So far it's mainly general information about his background and squadron. It's of interest to me, but not I imagine to you. Herr Major.  - Excuse me. Major Brandt Yes, Enheim. I don't believe it. Stay there. Sergeant Walker has escaped from his escort. Get a car. I hold you personally responsible for this. Berlin was right in thinking that I was needed here. Yes. Where? Right? Help me, please. Come back. Please. I need to telephone. A friend. His father sells flowers. Money. For the telephone. Argent? Quick. Quickly. Please.. I can't remember. I can't remember. Where? Thank you. But the Luftwaffe already.. - Never mind the Luftwaffe. Bring in more men and comb the area. I want Walker caught - But... - Go. Go. My car at once. Oh, you take it up to her. I can't. Do you hate her so much? - No, I don't. I felt sorry for her, once. Not anymore. She's a bitch, and she's Albert's wife. There's nothing I can do about it, and he won't. Well, have you made a decision yet about Walker? Are you going to get him out? - Lisa? I don't know Monique. You'll just have to wait for Albert to get back. Why did Albert ask us to meet him here? It's far too dangerous. The Candide will be open in a minute. He always has his reasons, Jacques. Did you take Andrée's tea up? How was she? - Albert. Where have you been? What are we going to do about Walker? There's no need for concern. He's no longer our problem. Thank you, dear. No, the unhappy Sergeant is dead. He need trouble us no further. The bullet that killed him was German.  Ah Monique. This is for our conquering heroes. Not our friends. I'll get a bottle of my special. I think you'll like it. You must have one drink and then you must all go. I still have30 bottles left, but I don't think they'll outlast the war. Hey ho.
