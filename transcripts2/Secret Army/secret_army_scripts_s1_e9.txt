 One moment. Lisa, how nice to see you. You came very early. Yes, on the morning train. Sophie, I have three customers for you today. Can you take them? Need you ask? Madeleine will be delighted. Where is Madeleine? - She's gone to visit a friend for a few days in Paris. Paris? Why? - A sick friend, Lisa, but she'll be back today. You've had a bad journey? - No. No, all went well. I'm sorry. I'm being short tempered with everyone. Forgive me. There's nothing to forgive. Would you like some coffee? Please.

 Now tell me all about it. There isn't very much to tell, Sophie. We've been very unlucky this past month. We've lost some of our workers in the South, and others have had to be found. There's also trouble in Brussels and now, and now, there's trouble in Paris. I heard about Paris. - What did you hear? Just that there's trouble... - Is that why Madeleine... No, no, she was going to visit a friend. I told you. I've brought you some money. We've never asked for money, my dear, you know that. We're just happy to help you. - Sophie. You will have three very hungry men to feed, and because of the troubles they might be here for quite some time. Madeline and I are always pleased to help you, but no money please. You will need food coupons though. - Yes we do. Madeline's got something very special for you. And butter!

 Is everything alright? - Yes. Is it Nathalie? No, she's with your three customers. She'll be here soon. Wait there. Stay here, I'll try and get you something to eat. Then what are you worrying about? - Paris. And my uncle. - There, I knew there was something. Is your uncle in trouble? He's not in danger yet, but he's been careless and he has been questioned. They'll be watching every move. - If he's half as clever as his niece, he'll be quite safe. You'll see. Your coffee is getting cold. - I'm sorry. Now, tell me what else we have to do. I want you to keep this for me until it's collected from you. - Collected from here? - Yes. If all is well in Paris, it will be collected immediately. If all is not well, it will be collected within the next 2 weeks. A man will come to you and he will give the name Morel. Morel. - Yes, Jacques Morel. When he gives that name, you will ask who sent him. He will say Yvette sent me and you will give him this. - Right. Now then, Natalie will be here within an hour, with the three evaders. Of course. Will you come back? - Yes. Yes, after I've been to Paris, Sophie, is Monsieur Laurent in Senlis? I saw him at his garage yesterday. But be careful Lisa. You know what they say about Monsieur Laurent? He's not our kind. He blows things up. He even kills Germans. I know what they say Sophie. But Mr Laurent is a good patriot and he knows what's going on in Paris. If he's in Senlis, I must see him before I go. Would that be alright there? - Yes, quite safe. I'll expect Natalie in an hour, Madeleine will be pleased. Thank you, Sophie. - Goodbye dear. Have you heard from Paris? From one of my best contacts, who's now in hiding. It's getting worse again. Have you news of my people? It started two nights ago with a raid by the Abwehr on the offices of the CNR and at Notre-Dame. This time it is said they found some files. The names were passed on to the Gestapo. Next morning it started. Arrests. With each arrest, more names. Mornings brought more arrests until no one feels safe. The resistance groups in Paris have gone into hiding. No one moves. And all day the Gestapo cars plow the streets. But this doesn't affect my people, Julius. We're quite separate. Separate? It affects two of your people, Jaques and Vincent Frank, and if it affects two, it affects everyone. But they were told they must only work for Lifeline. They swore they would work only for me. Working separately keeps us safe. Safe? It's not safe for any of us. It's not even safe for you to be here. I have my name in a little black book. Now go back to Brussels Yvette. I'll let you know when something... - Julius. That's all I could get. Alright. Do you fancy her? No. I jus want to get out of here mate. God how much longer I'm soaked. - Patience. That's what we were told Mac. Have trust and patience. I know. Can't you find out where Jaques is? - I've already told you my contact has gone to ground. Is there nothing you can do? I'll try and reach him this evening. Now, can you stay in Senlis until then? Yes, thank you, Julius. - I can promise nothing. Leave this to me. You came to hire a bicycle. I'm sorry Madame, you can try again at 6:00 o'clock. Can I help you? - Six o'clock you say? You can try madame. Monsieur Laurent? Monsieur Laurent at your service, Monsieur. Inspector. What can I do for the Inspector? Mademoiselle... Your papers, please. - But I was only a customer. Your inspector has let me leave. Mademoiselle... It is my orders. I must see your papers. Lisa Colbert? They are in order, mademoiselle. - Thank you. - But... What is it you want? What is the inspector searching for? Don't you know? - If I knew I'd tell you. It would save my place being torn to pieces. You will have lots of time to tell me. It's the third time she's looked at her watch. Worried,she is now. Dead worried. Yes, and she's joined the club. Are you worried? - Terrified. All right, all right. I'm sorry, there can be no bicycles today, Madam. Take him away. Are you hurt, madame? - No, no. I'm alright. Madame... No, mademoiselle. - Of course, mademoiselle. He called you madame. I'm a stranger here, I only came here to... - hire a bicycle. Among many other lines, that is what he says, is it also what you say? Yes, I, I only came here to Senlis to hire a bicycle. Did you know he's a terrorist? - No. He's also a very stubborn man. Most of them are, these terrorists. You are... a very pretty girl. - Thank you. And you say you have never seen this man. No I have never seen this man before. Then why were you so upset? Madamoiselle He was hurt. He needed help. Oh, why are you here? The gendarme said that he had orders that everyone in the street had to be seen by you. I see. You are Lisa Colbert. Age 24 school teacher. You are a Belgian subject born at Biesme. - Yes. You teach there, at Biesme? - No, I work as a nurse now. In Senlis? - No, in Brussels. You are resident in Brussels, but you were here in Senlis. When did you come here? On the morning train. - Why? Why, mademoiselle did you come to Senlis this morning? I'm, I'm on holiday and I came to see a friend here, but it seems as if she's now moved to Paris. That, that's why I was trying to hire a bicycle, to get there. But without success. Tell me mademoiselle, why did you come to this garage? I asked in the street. I was directed here. Then you were misdirected mademoiselle. Such a man does not hire his bicycle to young school teachers from Brussels. He keeps them for his terrorists. - Seems I was mistaken. You come to this cycle hirer, and yet you have no cycle permit to show me. Oh yes, I do have a cycle permit at home. I just didn't think I would need one here. And you live with your parents in Brussels? - No, my my parents died in the war. The girlfriend you come here to see? - She's gone to Paris to find work. You can't give me her address in Paris, but you can give me your last address in Senlis. Number two. Rue Dupont. And her name please. - Martine... Hamel. You live alone. No, I live with my uncle and aunt. Their names please. This uncle and aunt. Gaston... ... and Louise... Colbert. - Colbert. Yes, he's my father's brother. And they live at this address? Now let's see what we have. We have one return ticket from Senlis to Brussels. An identity document in the name of Lisa Colbert, and the ration book and the travel permit in the same name. And the pretty girl called Lisa Colbert. Is that all you wanted to know? I wish I could say yes, mademoiselle. Unfortunately, everything you have told me has still to be checked. Why? Because today you were seen with a terrorist mademoiselle. But it was mistake. I don't know him. - Life is full of mistakes mademoiselle. Please you don't understand. - But I do understand mademoiselle. I'm impressed by your pretty face, but not by your story. So you will cancel your trip to Paris and your return to Brussels. Have her taken to the prison at Pontoise. Would you like something else? - No no. I'm late already. My dear, I'm sorry. Gerard is coming to the bank this afternoon. That means more bookkeeping. - Get the clerks to do the bookkeeping. It is not your place to do these things. Gaston, I want you to stop these other activities. They're dangerous. Lisa can do as she pleases, she's young. Gaston, I'm frightened. - But why sweetheart? I don't know, but every day it comes every day I die inside. Gaston, if you care for me at all. I'm not hysterical. You can see I'm quite calm. Please, we only have each other. Natalie. - Where's Lisa? - She went to find you, my dear. Come in quickly. What happened, didn't she meet you? Sophie, we've been waiting for her in the park as arranged. When did she leave? Hours ago. This morning. She said you'd bring three young men. They're sitting in the cinema. They're hungry and they know that something's wrong. I had to put them somewhere while I came to see you. Did Lisa say where she was going? I, I think she was going to Paris. No Sophie. She wouldn't do that without coming to me first. I know. She was going to see Monsieur Laurent. He has a sort of garage in the Rue SÃ©bastien. Well, I'll go there. And can I bring the airmen to you Sophie. Is that alright? Yes, that's fine. Goodbye. - Oh dear. You'll find prison clothes on that bunk. Change into them and then read the regulations. Obey the prison regulations and you'll be well treated. Disobey them. You'll be punished. Do you have a cigarette? - No. Not that it matters. I'm Denise from Rouen. Lisa Colbert from Brussels. This is Maria. Maria Pinago. Get up. They put no marks on you. - No. They broke Maria's arm. Why? Her father's a communist, they came for him, but he escaped. So they took Maria and broke her arm. - The bastards. Where are the regulations I'm supposed to learn? - No need to read them, we can tell you. In bed by 10, up at 6:30, at work by 7, wearing this. We have to sweep and scrub. We keep the prison clean for the men. - Men? 30 men and eight women and never the twain shall meet. Now tell us why you're here. I was interrogated today. I'm just here until they check my story. Is that what they said? You're here until they shoot you. - You're in Pontoise. Haven't you heard of it? - No. We're hostages. If they have a case against you, they take you to court. If they have no case, just a suspicion, they say they're checking your story. You're sent here. And once here you're forgotten. And when our friends on the outside blow up a train or kill German soldiers. they shoot hostages. For this area we're the hostages. Unnamed. Unknown. One day they'll be trouble. They'll come here, choose 10, and shoot them. It's 10:00 o'clock time for bed. What's this? - Yvette's travel case. I can see it's Yvette's travel case. - She's been arrested. God no. Yvette? - She was arrested in Senlis. Where've they taken her? - I don't know, Albert. I tried for two days to find out. - You've known about this for two days? I haven't Albert. I was trying to find out. The airmen are safe. To hell with the airmen. Our concern is Yvette. Give her a chance Albert. She's trying to tell you. Sit down. I'm listening. I spoke to everyone we can trust in Senlis. Yvette left me to go and see Sophie. And then she went to see Julius. To his garage. Julius? Why? There's trouble in Paris Albert, so she went to talk to him, and while she was there the police came for Julius and Yvette was taken. Why did she have to go there? He's a saboteur. They're always after saboteurs. What did they do to her? They took them both to headquarters. And then sent them to prison. Julius was taken to Paris, to Fresnes. But Yvette wasn't sent there. I don't know where she is, Albert. Pontoise. Pontoise. That's where she'll be. Julius knows about our houses North of Paris. They've got to be closed immediately and there can be no further contact with them until we know what's happening. I'll phone Gaston at the bank. Monique, is your travel permit in order? - Yes. Here's some money. I can't leave this place. Now take the Rapide to Paris and don't come back until we've got word to everyone. Yes, Albert, yes. Oh AndrÃ©e, not now. Should I go? Monique. - I know. Be careful. - You too. You know? - Yes. Do you know where she is? Pointoise. I came to tell you. Is she all right? - Yes. Well, at least she's not with the Gestapo. Instructions have been sent out to close the houses North of Paris. But Julius is with the Gestapo. He may have talked. He is to be shot. Julius knows Yvette so all the houses must be closed North and South. Shot? - He was betrayed. Are you quite certain she's in Pontoise? Yes I'm sure. It's been checked. She was imprisoned the same evening she'd been interrogated. She would not seem to be ill treated or tortured. She was not seen to be tortured. Obviously they don't know who she is... ...yet. Can you get word to close the houses South of Paris? And don't come back to the Candide until all this is over. Your inspector's not the only one that's been checking on you. Our men have been checking. They want to speak to you. I thought we weren't allowed to speak. That's what the regulations say. Our men don't always obey them. They want to know who you really are. - I'm Lisa Colbert from Brussels, I told you. Then you've got nothing to worry about, have you? On the other hand, your arrest may not have been the mistake you say it was. You don't say much about yourself. If you want to make a good impression you should smarten yourself up. He won't stay long He? - Jan. He's the leader in here. We were arrested together. I hope you have the right answers for him. Are you Lisa Colbert? Yes. Who are you? - His name is Jan. He was my boss. - Is your boss Your code name? - I don't know what you're talking about. You better speak. There isn't much time. - Why have you come to see me? Because Paul has spoken for a Lisa Colbert. - Paul? Give her a chance. All right. You were arrested at a garage. Whose garage? - Julius Laurent. In Paris, Julius Laurent is known as Paul. He's a member of our cell and has asked that we help his friend Lisa Colbert. He has given us information about this Lisa Colbert - if you are Lisa Colbert. We will help you. If you are not... - I am Lisa Colbert. And tell us about Julius Laurent. When did you first meet? We met five months ago in a house in Senlis in the rue Dupont And then in his garage in the Rue Sebastien. Go on. He would help me sometimes with transport and with news from Paris. And you.... We appreciate your caution, but we have our own security. We know what Lisa Colbert does and her code name. Do you? Trust him, Lisa. No, wait. I run an escape line. Go on. My code name is Yvette. Jacques and Vincent. Who are they? - My helpers in Paris. What did you last talk about to Julius? I was asking him if they were safe. Correct. There is news for you. Vincent has been arrested, but Jacques is still free and working for you. How do you know all this? We inherited a grapevine that took a year to perfect. Most of our guards are French and one of them is on our side, so we are in touch with other prisons and people on the outside. Soon we will have a key to the outside and one day we will go. Paul has spoken for you. Would you escape with us? - Of course. Those who come will be risking their lives. - My life is already at risk. We've been into the prison office to check your file. They know nothing yet of your escape line. You are marked only as Lisa Colbert, Belgian citizen, school teacher from Brussels, now working as a nurse. Suspect. Suspected of what? - Nothing specific as yet, but Landre's interrogation is on file. He didn't get far with you. I think she's coming. Jan, when will this happen? - Soon I hope. Denise will tell you. And one last thing. Your friends know where you are. You've been quite a trouble to us, haven't you? I've been no trouble to anyone monsieur. I'm a peaceful law abiding man. A respectable bank manager. - Assistant Bank Manager. It's getting late and my wife will be worried. I was only going for a walk. You may telephone. To telephone her from here would make even more worried. - Very likely. If you are so law abiding, why is it you being questioned so often? Everyone is questioned. You have a niece living with you, Lisa Colbert. - She lives with us, yes. At this moment? - She is a young woman. She has a life of her own. She works very hard as a nurse. Does it say something about Lisa? - Should it? No, she is a good girl. She does good work with her patients. Does it say something about her in there? - No. But it says something about you. It says here that you should be watched. - I don't know why. Then I will tell you. You have a file in this office because of your behavior. Like your behavior this evening, and because of the friends you meet. Friends who deal in stolen documents, stolen ration cards. I know of no such things. - Good. If you are such a law abiding citizen, you will be prepared to help us. If you are not our enemy, Monsieur Colbert, you must be our friend. We expect our friends to cooperate. - Yes. As assistant bank manager, you know many people in this town. People in the town Hall, in the police, in business.... Look at these names. One who works in the town Hall where identity cards are issued. One in the police where permits are issued. One who works in the food office. You know these men. They're customers at the bank. - You also meet them socially. In a cafe at lunchtime or in the evening. We've been watching you. You know these men well. - Yes. You will tell me about them. If your wife is worried about you, you should not distress her further by protecting such people. No need to hurry. You will write down all you know about them. Madamoiselle - You should not have come here. - Gaston's missing. What do you mean missing? - Louise says so. She's worried. She says he spent most of the evening in Yvette's room and then he went out. He hasn't come back. Did she know where he was going? - No. She's desperate about Yvette's arrest and says they'll come and searched the house. Louise says he was carrying a bag. I think he was trying to remove anything that would incriminate us. That is part of the emergency plan. I told her to telephone here the moment Gaston returns. - Good. You'd better go. I'll let you know whe it's safe to return. - Take care. - Mademoiselle. This is useless. - I don't know much about them monsieur. That's a lie. But it proves one thing. That we were right to follow you. So we will change the subject and you will tell me what you were doing by the river after curfew. I forgot the time until you officer spoke to me. Who were you going to meet? - No one. I'd gone for a walk. Do you know why you were being followed? - No. Because we know there's an escape line operating in the city for airmen. And we know that you are an important member of it. - No! Let us try again. Monsieur Colbert. I am tired. You are tired, and it is so easy to become forgetful. You were waiting for someone on the corner. - I was not waiting for anyone. I was by the river. - Why were you waiting by the river? I'd gone for a walk. I have toothache. I couldn't rest so I went for a walk by the river. I didn't know what time it was. I didn't care until your officers spoke to me. When you were first seen by the river you were carrying a bag. When approached by my men, it had gone. What happened to it? - I had no bag. Did you give it to someone? - I had no bag. Will we find out when we search that part of the river? What will we find? Stolen permits, identity cards, ration cards. It's full of them Monsieur Colbert. Will your wife identify this bag? My officers have seen you carrying it this evening. Please, may I telephone my wife? No. You will tell me all about this. And then we will have some long talks about your friends. Get a move on both of you. The water was freezing. - Denise, when we go we have to wear these. See if she's gone. I think she has. Your own clothes will be in the office. That's where they keep them. The Boche are very thorough. Everything has to be labeled. Were you arrested with your own papers? - Yes Then we will have to destroy your file. We were caught with false papers and brazened it out so they don't know who we really are. When we escape, we can just disappear. How many will Jan take? - As many as he can push through before the alarm goes? Do we all go together? - No, no. In pairs. A man and a woman seen together at night, especially coming from a field is thought to be typically French. So every woman who volunteers will break out with a man. - Who are these men? That cow, Denise can we trust them? Of course. Four of them are from our own cell, including Jan. No more talking. 2 minutes to lights out. We'll soon be free. Thank you. So you've decided to cooperate. - Yes. Good. Sit down. Later we will have work to do, you and I. May I telephone my wife? Please. All these forms. There's always so much paperwork. Don't you find? Are you alright? Any news? Brussels. - Quiet, Charlotte. It's fixed for tonight. The new key has been tried and it works. The guards have their supper between 9 and 10. The French guards go first, then the German guards. We leave when the German guards are in the canteen. It gives us just less than half an hour to make the break. Understood? - Yes. We must accept that the escape will be discovered not later than the midnight round. That gives us a possible 2 hours before the alarm is sounded and the roadblocks go up. After that.... Maria, are you coming? - Yes. You will be called when the German guards go to the canteen. It's the same old pigswill. Are you ready? - Yes. Here it is. Lisa Colbert. Your identity papers. The Boche puts everything in writing. When he loses the file, he loses everything. Matches? The French guards have settled down to beer and playing dominoes. - Are they still in the restroom? Till the German guards have finished eating. The Boche have got their snouts in the trough. Right? You four, you go first. You will head West and make for Nantes. Frangoise knows it. Michel, Yvette, Maria, Jean-Claude... You will head North and make for the farm at Vigny. Here is a map and a compass. It's 20 miles so you'll have to travel fast while it's still dark. We will take a chance, and make for Paris. Give them two minutes. Time to move Mr. Colbert. Monsieur Colbert. We now have a journey to make. People to identify. Come. Please can I telephone my wife? Halt. Good luck. Albert. Gaston is not here. You see, he went out on some business. I haven't seen him for two whole days. Is it Lisa? No... - She's often away for several days at a time. I'm used to her absences but... - Louise... Coffee? - Yes please. You see I have everything ready... - Come and sit down. Come on. My dear... Gaston is dead. He was shot by the Gestapo. There is very little more we know at the moment. I am so very sorry. Can I get you anything? Would you like me to stay? All right? Good luck, Yvette. See you in Paris. - Paris. Stop them. We got caught. - Yvette? - She got away. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Jan. - No. Who is she? I asked you, who is she? - You have her file. You should know. Burned. Why did it have to be burnt? Only her file? Why was she the first to escape? Who is she? - We don't know. You shared a cell with her. You talked. All you terrorists talk, now who is she? We don't know who she is. - Come here you little commu.... You'll tell me what you did know. We know nothing about her. Because of this escape, the Germans are going to shoot five prisoners. You'll be one, and you'll be another. Don't ypu understand? I'm trying to save your stupid lives. Collaborator. For God's sake... - Leave her alone. Guard, take her. Let go of me... She is going to be shot. Yes. You're both going to be shot if you don't talk. There isn't much time. Who was she? I don't know. Why are you trying to protect her? - She didn't say anything. I don't know. Guard, take her away. My arm, let go of my arm.
