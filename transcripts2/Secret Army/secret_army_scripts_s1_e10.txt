 Friend. British. Anglais. Come on. Come on, son. Come on. In the boat. How are you? Getting thinner. You? When did you sleep last? I've been on the move nonstop for days. I'd have thought you had enemies enough without still treating me as one.

 Am I doing that, John? I'm sorry. I'm only here because Rene Thiery asked me to be here. The communist? - His line has been broken. Betrayed? - Or infiltrated. It has to be one or the other. What's the damage? - We don't know yet. Thierry's gone underground. Sounds as though he needs your help more than we do. - He needs yours as well. We don't want his ideas. Has he never helped you? You don't know what we're asking yet. He's got four evaders housed in the North, and he can't move them. Now, if they're lucky, they can stay there and rot. But if the whole line has been betrayed... Four of them... I'm asking for their sake, not mine. Not Thierry's. Their sake. Take them on. I'll bring them myself.

 Have they been interrogated? - Yes Have they got papers? - I think so. Because it's not so easy at short notice... ... with Gaston dead. Although that won't stop them coming, will it? Will you take them? Please. - Yes. Where did you crash? I didn't. I bailed out - Where? Up north I think. North! Where did you land? I don't know. In a town or a village? In a damned tree! Can you describe the country? - Look, it was pitch black. Woods What sort? How do I know? A tree's a tree. What about the others? The rest of your crew? Didn't they jump? I only saw one come out. I think it was Brian. I don't know about anyone else. You don't know much, do you? - Danke What? - Thank you. You said Danke. Put it down. Hey, no need for that, you know. Lie down. - But what are you gonna do with me? Depends who you are. - I've told you. Maybe you have. Maybe you haven't. Lie down. - Look, it's on my dog tags. Uys, Noel. 27669. That's who I am. - Give it to me. No. Lie down. On your stomach. Hands behind your back. If you weren't married, I would... Anything else? - Monique? Do I know you? We have a mutual friend, Joseph Poulin. I'm afraid I don't know him. We fish together. - I don't know him. I remember him telling me once that you had friends who sometimes help people. I'm sorry, I don't want you talking about. Never mind, here's something for being as pretty as Joseph said you were. A man just gave these to Monique outside. He says he's a friend of Joseph Poulin. I think we ought to talk to him. It's better if he sees no one else. It's safer. You question him. I'll listen from up there. Where did you get these? - Are they genuine? I don't know. Where is he? - Safe. How long can you keep him? How long do you need? - Oh two, three days. Will I be paid? You could be. Three days. No longer. - Right. What time is it? - Almost 5. I'm must go. My train just about to leave. - Do you have to go now? Why? We found another evader. We need someone... What's the matter? I just thought you might say something else. Maybe that I look too tired to travel or something. It doesn't matter. Why should I? - Yes, why should you? I never understand you. Someone's got to interrogate this evader. - Someone else Who? He says he's RAF. - Then talk to London. It's too dangerous at the moment, and it takes time. I'm have to meet Thierry at a certain place at a certain time. If I miss him, then God knows when I'll find him. Damn Communist. He's got four evaders, you've only got the one. Find out what you can. You're constantly telling me how well you managed before I turned up. Should be easy. - John. And this is his address. White Trees, near... Ask Alain, he wrote it. - Alain, your writing's impossible. What does that say? White Trees near...? Boshof. - Boshof? That's his address in South Africa. - And the boy's high school? Kim... Kimberly. That's where he went to school according to London. And these other two? - Yes, I can just about read them, thank you. It's not my writing. It's the stupid names. Boshoff Well that's South Africa. Here, take these with you. It'll look good if you're supposed to be going on a picnic. - Thanks, Alain. Are you ready? - Yes. Yvette says we must be absolutely sure. Yes. - No, this time more than ever Jacques. A single evader appearing without any warning, so close to Brussels, could be an infiltrator. - I know, I know. That's what's happened to Rene Thierry. Did you know? - We don't know that for certain. It may have happened. And what do you do if you're not absolutely certain? Yvette said we should... - I know. I know. Have you actually killed anyone before? Come on. I don't understand. I've told you who I am. - That's not enough. You've seen my dog tags. What else is there? - Answers to our questions. I don't have to tell you anything. - We don't have to help you. That's what you want, isn't it? Course I do. I do. - Then you must answer the questions. How long have you been hiding? About ten days - We want to know exactly. I can hardly remember. It's ten I think. - What was the date of your last trip? Eighth. It was the last day of the first quarter. And what were you flying in? - Whitley. and your target. No, I'm not telling you that. Why should you want to know? I don't have to tell you that even if you are helping me. What hit you? Night fighter on the way there. - How many of you jumped? Only saw one come out. Suppose the others must have. - Would tell us their names. Why? - Don't you trust us? Why should I? - Because ours is the only offer of help you're likely to get. So tell us the names of the other members of your crew. Teddy Marsh, pilot. He's an Aussie. Brian Preston, rear gunner. Guy Matthews Navigator. Billy Mills, bomb aimer. If you were hit by a nightfighter, how come the rear gunner wasn't killed? Well, the jerry must have missed him. But we got hit in the engine. We caught. fire. What did you do when you landed? - Walked. Pardon? - Walked. What happened to your parachute? - I buried it. You told our friend you landed in a tree. - Yes, true. How badly entangled were you? Pretty bad, I had to cut myself down. Then you pulled your parachute down and buried it? Best I could. - You pulled a tangled parachute out of the branches of a tree... - In the dark. - then buried it. That's what they tell you to do. I got the rope burns doing it. Where? It doesn't matter to us whether you buried it or not. What we want is the truth about you. I buried it. I did. Look, you know who I am. - NO, we don't know who you are. Because you can't prove it. And for all we know, you could be German. - No. So could you. Works both ways. What's the address of your home in South Africa? - Lalapanzi farm. Again. - Lalapanzi farm What school did you attend? Christian Brothers College, Kimberley. When you volunteered for the RAF, you were asked to provide 2 character witnesses. Their names, addresses and professions. Tell us who yours were. Two people, who knew you well enough, to stand as character witnesses. Surely you remember who they were? Your priest? Your employer? Your school teacher? Can't remember. Who is Peter Van Heerden? He is... I don't know. He was the man who owned the radio repair shop in Kimberly, where you worked. And you would certainly know him. I agreed three days. Only three. So now you'll take him with you. We can't. We need time to double check with London. - No. Yvette said to be absolutely sure. Do we have any choice? - No. Alright, but not here. There's a better place further on. - Fine, we'll dump him there. What if he floats up? - He won't. We'll tie weights around the body. I'll cycle up the path and keep a lookout. - Alright. Get up. Move. I'll go first. Come on. I can't. Let him go. - Not here. Stop. Come over. Over there. Come on. Take off your jacket. And your cap. Put them down here. Jacques, what happened? Stop. Stop or I'll shoot. Get up. Come on, move. That way. Come on. You want to stay? - They should have been back by now. Well, there's still plenty of time. Something's gone wrong. Alain heard from London on the midday broadcast. The last 15 airmen got back safely. Something's wrong. Come on move. Climb up there. Get in there. You hear that. It means someone will come. Sooner or later. And then what will you do? Huh? Someone made a mistake when they chose you. Who do you work for? The Gestapo? You were going to kill me. Why? Why? - Boche! We have a problem. The Germans are searching Doctor Kelderman's place. Alain's just come from there. They won't find anything. He's very careful. - That's not the point. He's on his way back from Bruges with the three evaders, remember? Well Kessler's bound to leave one man behind, inside the surgery, and Doctor Kelderman's not going to find out until it's too late. He must be warned. Well, one of us could keep a lookout for the ambulance and warn him, surely. Not this time. There was no gasoline for the ambulance. He's had to go and meet them on foot. We've no idea which way they'll return. Like we were saying. There are only three ways of getting to the surgery. We'll just have to watch all three. Well, I won't open for a while. I'll come. Just a minute. We can't all go and leave the cafe unattended. Suppose Natalie or Jaques try to contact us. - Yeah. Gone. No. No, it's a question of priorities. We've got to try and save Doctor Kelderman. Albert. You take the corner by the post office, I'll get your coat. Alain patrol the end of the Stone Road. They might come through there. I'll stay by the church in case they come through it? - Right. I'm sure Monique can handle it. She has her own key. Natalie and Jacques are not fools. They may be young... Will Andre be alright. Oh, I better go and see to her. You two start. I haven't as far to go. - We'll meet back here in one hour. - I'll be right with you. Can I have a beer please? I don't open for another hour, I'm sorry. I'm not open. - A beer. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. Quickly please. I have an urgent appointment. I'm sorry. Good, thank you. You must go, now. Albert, open the door. Quickly please. I've seen you with Germans. I've seen you. Collaborators. - Bitch, you'll pay for that. There she is. She has to die. Why me? What have I done? I'm not a collaborator. Come here. - Collaborator. I'm not a collaborator. I'm a loyal Belgian, just like you. And you sleep with the Boche. - Go away. Collaborator. We'll get you. Leave me alone. Go away. You're ill. You can't stay here for long. You know that, don't you? - I'm alright. Just need to rest. Your leg will be septic by morning. - You shut up. - But you'll lose the leg. Will you shut up. Shut up, and get down here. Get down. Get down there. You, sit down. Sit down. Well now what? You just shut up. You shut up. Monique, it's Albert. Monique? It's alright. Open the door. The bolts. It's alright. It's alright. Thank you, you've been very helpful. Could you stay there for a while? Come back tonight and I'll find a bottle of wine for you. - Thank you. Come on. - They said...we were collaborators. I thought they were going to kill me Albert. - We're going to be alright. And there was nobody here. Quiet. - I was frightened. Now we don't need that anymore. Here. Drink this. Come on. That's your best brandy. - Drink up. They really think we're collaborators. - Come on. Sit down. Don't they know what we're doing? - No, and we don't want them to. It doesn't matter what they think. It helps us sometimes. Now you must understand that. We can stand it. Better? - Yes. I am now. Come on. There's some cleaning up to be done. Good heavens! What happened? Some of our neighbors think we're too friendly with the Germans. Are you alright? - I'm fine. Still no Jacques, Natalie? Well someone ought to check. I could go see what they're up to. - If the Germans have taken them... Perhaps it's nothing to do with them. Perhaps they're just delayed. - Natalie would have let us know. But if they have been taken, who's to say they haven't already talked? - Not yet. Even Jacques. - The Gestapo could be on the way here now. Monique, how long would it take you to contact the typist you know in their headquarters? He won't be there on duty for another hour. - Alright, we'll have to wait for another hour. But if there's the slightest suspicion that the Germans are searching, we'll have to close all the houses down. Good evening. Oh yes, I remember. Yes, do come in. This is Doctor Kelderman's nurse. - Pleased to meet you. And this is the young lady you helped save this afternoon. You're feeling better? - Yes, thank you. We you both thank you very much. Please, sit down. I'll just get that bottle I promised you. Monique, let's have some music. Please, excuse me. Now, this is one of my very last bottles, so don't tell your friends where you got it. - Thank you. I hope you enjoy it. and thanks once again. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Jacques.You're hurt. - Oh, it's nothing. They've taken Natalie. But you were supposed to protect her. Are you sure this boy's German? Yes, he couldn't answer the questions. He wasn't the person London told us about. - Could London have made a mistake? Double checked. Nothing's changed. I think I cut his leg badly. All he's got is an empty shotgun. Won't get far. But he could use Natalie as bait to bring us out. Nevertheless, you're going back to the lock. Take Alain and Jean-Luc with you and search the area thoroughly. Now? No, no, you need some rest. First thing in the morning. And if we find them. Kill him. Aren't you thirsty? Huh? Must be. Oh God, Why didn't you bring water? This stuff just makes you more thirsty. What's your name? Hey you! What's your name?! Talk to me. I'm Noel. Talk to me. You're frightened. - Yeah. Your leg's getting worse. Yeah, I'm scared alright. - Why? You have the gun. I'm not German. If I was German I would have killed you. - Like you did the others? No, I didn't. No. Only the lock keeper, I think. I volunteered to fight the Germans, not you. The first man I've killed is supposed to be on the same damn side as me. Lisa, my dear. Thank you. Thank you for the warning. Everything alright? Yes,I took the two from Hamme to Rue Danielle. They'll be safe enough there for the moment. They've got their papers and so they're just waiting to be collected. You know, I almost missed you. If one of those three hadn't... We've got another problem, Pascal. - Oh. What's that? We think the Germans have taken Natalie. - Oh no my dear. If they succeed in making her talk, the whole line could go. Natalie is the one person apart from myself who knows everything. She knows names, addresses, codes. I realize that. Do you think the surgery is under suspicion? I mean that, that raid yesterday. I don't know, but we can't take any risks, can we? I want you to go away. Somewhere safe. Oh yes, but how can I, my dear? - You have an escape plan. I know you have. Your sister's house in Bruay. Yvette. - Oh, my goodness. Four?! Where are we going to put them Pascal? I made my first cat's whisker when I was eight. That's all I ever wanted to do. Play with the radio. I never wanted to be a farmer like my father. No, I made my first valve set when I was 12. I used to lie in bed with the headphones on instead of going to sleep. I used to listen just as long as there was anything to hear? Sometimes my sister would come in. She'd want to have a turn. She'd start crying. Then, ma'd come. She'd bring my father with his belt. And then after they'd gone, I'd put the headphones back on. Oh God, it was a heck of a night those nights. Just lying there, listening. You look a bit like her you know. Like my sister. Just a bit. What's her name, your sister? Tessa. Tessa. How old is she? Two years younger than me. Sixteen. No. You must be over 18 or they wouldn't let you fly. I told them I already was 18 when I volunteered. That's how keen to get in I was. - Did you lie to the Air Ministry? No. I think you're still lying to me. - No. Well, you can't prove any of it. It's empty. It always was empty. If you've done what I said and interrogated Uys instead of going to help your communist friend, all this needn't have happened. You knew I was coming back. - But we didn't know when - Why the panic? The lock keeper would only hide him for three days. That's all the time we had to check and clear him. We couldn't wait for you. So what were we supposed to do? Anyway, it's too late now. - What do you mean it's too late? I sent Jacques and Jean Luc to kill him. - Why? He couldn't answer any of the questions London gave us, and he killed the lock keeper. What more do you need? - Something, just a bit more conclusive. Marsh, will you come here. - Yes, of course. Yvette, Teddy Marsh. - Hello Miss. Marsh was the pilot of a Whitley that was shot down by a nightfighter nearly two weeks ago. Yeah dead right? We were lucky to get out before the whole thing blew up. - He was picked up by Thierry's Line. Tell her about your wireless operator. Noel Uys? What do you want to know about him? - Just tell her about him, will you? Well, for a start, he's just a kid. I reckon he's 18. Speaks with a thick South African accent.He comes from a place called Kimberley. What does he look like? - I was just thinking about that. He's medium height with blonde hair. What else? - He's a good radio operator. He only ever seemed to talk about his sister. Oh yeah, that's right. He often talked about a sister called Tessa. Listen, what's going on here? Do you know where he is? - Over there please. This man can positively identify Uys. Where is he? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know. - I don't know. You've lost him? You don't know what direction they went in? - They could be anywhere by now. Do you realize what you've done? - I had to make a decision. You've ordered an innocent man to be killed. Alain. Natalie's bicycle. The questions were given to us by London. Are you saying they made a mistake? No, me. I couldn't remember what I told them. Your address and the school you went to? - I lied. To us? No, to them. - Why? So ma wouldn't find out. - What? She's scared of losing me after pa volunteered. He was fighting in East Africa by then and she said she'd tell them how old I really was, just to stop me getting in. But after pa'd gone, there was only me to run the farm. Apart from the blacks. I hated it. So you lied, just to escape? I wanted to fly. I knew I could be a good wireless operator. So what was the use of being a farmer? I reckoned it was safer to volunteer for the RAF rather than the South African Air Force. Further away. Harder to check. But I was still scared she'd find out, so I gave them a different address and school. I thought I was lucky to slip through. What about your character witnesses? - I made them up. There was no one else I could ask. They'd have known ma. And when you lied, what address did you use? White Trees, near Boshof. And your school? High School Kimberly. You stupid kid. Why didn't you stay on your farm? The lock keeper would still be alive if you had. Yeah, he was gonna kill me. - Well now you know why. Do you believe me now? What now? Take you back. If I can. I can't get my foot in. They don't fit. Oh excuse me, Madam. Have you seen a young couple about here anywhere? Behaving strangely. I think he had a shotgun, and he probably had a limp. What have you got there? Nothing. - What do you mean nothing? What are you hiding? Nothing. I haven't got anything. They're mine. I found them, they were just lying there. I didn't steal them. Just a minute. - Please, please don't report me. Nathalie's? Where did you find them? Come on. Where? By the old mill, about half a kilometer away. I can keep them? I have to release the tourniquet or you'll lose the leg. It's not very good, is it? - You need a doctor. Why are you still here? You could have gone you know, when you knew the gun was empty. I couldn't stop you, not with this. I reckon I killed that bloke at the lock. Maybe the other one too. That means I'm a murderer. - No. Some would say you were already that when you dropped your first bomb. It's war. It can't be helped. This cut is very deep. Can you walk? No, I don't, I don't think so. - Then I must fetch help. How old are you? Nineteen. What's your name? Nathalie. Please trust me. Stay here and don't move. I have to find you again when I bring the doctor and you could put us all in jeopardy if you just stumble about outside. You must trust me. Please. Alain! - Natalie! - Where is he? - I left him here. To hell with the ... Shoot him on sight. - No, listen to me. He is genuine. Please Alain. I found out he gave false information when he enlisted. Jacques. I know he's genuine. He's just scared and hurt. He's confused. He thinks everyone wants to kill him, and he doesn't know why. He tried to kill me. - What would you have done in his position? We must find him. That's all very well but which way? He could have gone in any direction by now. There's only the four of us. If I was in his place I would go back the way I came. That way I would know what was ahead. Come on. Uys...Uys... Uys, come back. Uys, come back. Pull him out. Pull. Pull. Pull, please. Pull. One more. Pull. You stupid child. I trusted you.
