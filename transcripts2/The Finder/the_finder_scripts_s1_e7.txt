 The Finder (2012): Season 1, Episode 7 - Eye of the Storm - full transcript 
 A severe hurricane strikes Southern Florida, but torrential weather will not stop Walter from searching for a female high school student who went missing during the storm. While Walter is stranded on Looking Glass Key at the Ends of the Earth Bar, Isabel visits the missing girl's high school and uncovers clues that link her disappearance to foul play and a more serious and life threatening crime. Meanwhile, Willa's probation officer is stormed in with Walter, Leo and Willa, and puts her differences with Willa aside to help the team solve the case of the missing girl.

 You're way ahead of the game this time. 256 miles southeast of this very location, warm tropical ocean waters are colliding with a combo platter of thunderstorms... and upper-level winds to create what the Mayan refer to as the God of evil, Hurakan, and what the national weather service refers to as hurricane Catherine. Sure, but Catherine isn't expected

 to make landfall till this evening. We're only gonna catch the edge. Oh, I know better than that. I used to date a Catherine. Knowing her, she's gonna swerve from Alabama just to hit me. Open up, Willa. You're my last appointment. I want to get home before it really starts raining. Oh, God. Do you have a warrant? Oh, really, Willa? Every time? I'm your probation officer. I don't need a warrant.

 Are you sure? This doesn't sound American. Uncooperative. Want to check under my bed? Defensive. No dope smell? Shouldn't you mark that down? She gone? Man, she hates me. Not allowed a visit from your own cousin? She thinks you're a bad influence, and I don't need the aggravation. Don't leave until her car's gone. It's like the girl was daring me to report her for a violation. How respectful of authority were you at that age? I am not the one under supervision, Mr. knox. Now, can you confirm that Willa is adhering to all the requirements of her probation? I'm not her guardian. I'm her employer, and Willa is an exemplary employee. Mr. knox, why are you talking to me in your lawyer voice? You have a knack of putting people on the defensive, Mrs. Farrel. You know, I just want to wrap this up and get on the road. I don't think that's gonna happen. Why not? 'Cause Walter's right about hurricane Catherine. You mean I'm stuck here? Ooh. Who is this? Walter, I just pulled over to tell you I'm not gonna make it. I'm sorry. I'm on emergency call because of the storm. You have to make it. I'm planning on getting shut in for hours, maybe even days with nothing but hurricane-themed cocktails and you. Hey! You guys know the drill. What's going on? Oh, ends of the earth is the designated shelter for looking glass key. That is a terrifying thought. Yeah, I even came up with hurricane-themed pet names. You're Stormycakes, and I am señor Cyclone. Of course you did. Look, there's already been a storm surge here. Bridges are out all over the place. Alligators in the street. You know how it goes. Aww. Hurricanes are no fun without you. Aww. Well, I will take that as a compliment, and I'll check in with you later, ok, make sure that old bar is still standing. Bye. All right, fine. Isabel can't make it. Who's gonna drink all this? Serve yourselves. Now officially a category-4 storm, hurricane Catherine is expected to batter southern Florida with 145-mile-per-hour winds and torrential rain, trapping many of the residents out on the keys. Meteorologists are baffled by Catherine's inexplicable turn towards Florida, as though she had a mind of her own... Looks like you're gonna have to wait it out here. No! Seriously?! She makes a dash for it now, she might survive. As a result, school officials are not taking any chances. Students here at greendale high were instructed to remain at school due to the high storm surge in this low-lying area. While not all students are yet accounted for, one is definitely missing, 14-year-old Melissa Welling. The school said Melissa must have struck out for home on her own, but that doesn't sound like her, and she never made it. Please. Someone help me find my baby. The police said there's nothing anyone can do during a hurricane, but... please. Rescue workers discovered the girl's backpack and cell phone in a drainage ditch and believe she was swept off the Harley bridge by a storm surge. If anyone knows the whereabouts of Melissa Welling, please call the number on your screen. Walter. It's too late. What? What's too late? Walter's finder mojo kicked in. Now he's helpless. I can find her! Well, that was reckless. Or brave. You could go with brave. Why are you making a note? She can't blame me for Walter's weirdness. I'm evaluating your living arrangements, which includes your known associates. Walter knows what he's doing. Ok. Ok. It's pretty rough out there. It's a hurricane. You think a hurricane can stop Walter from finding Melissa Welling? The finder s01e07 eye of the storm ♪ yeah-ay ♪ yeah Sync and corrections by Norther for www.addic7ed.com Now, using a map of her neighborhood, news reports of the storm surge, and satellite imagery from current weather patterns, I whipped together an exact replica of Melissa Welling's typical walk home from school. This is an exact replica? Mm-hmm. It's how Walter's brain explains itself to him. Just follow the licorice bits. Now, Melissa starts at the cheese grater, ends up at the nutmeg. And the nutmeg is her house? Obviously. Obvious... Why obviously? Nutmeg equals eggnog; Eggnog, Christmas; Christmas, family; Family, home. But to get to the nutmeg, Melissa must cross spaghetti bridge. Now, a storm surge wipes out spaghetti bridge and, authorities believe, swept Melissa away. What's that, now? Melissa's backpack. Storm surge. All right, rescue workers found Melissa's backpack south of the bridge. Which would have put it near the stove, but the storm surge should have pushed it north, near the refrigerator, as we just witnessed. However that backpack got there, it wasn't from the storm surge. It must have just come through one of the city's storm drains. They're wasting their time looking for Melissa by the oven. She wasn't walking home, and she was never on that bridge. All right, I'm... Are you serious? Because, uh, really? There's a little girl out in a hurricane, and they aren't looking for her in the right place. Yeah, I'm serious. You once claimed Willa was a sociopath. Now she's trying to help Walter save a girl. Believing that a diorama made out of food products can help find a missing girl is the work of an unstable mind. Plus, on its face, maybe working in a bar isn't the best environment for a confirmed delinquent like Willa. The ends of the earth is a different type of drinking establishment. There's a reason it's considered the safest place in looking glass key. And that is a reflection on looking glass key. Ooh. I knew when I dumped Catherine, it was gonna come back to haunt me. You think hurricanes are all about you? Don't be ridiculous. Just the ones named Catherine. And Mimi and Karla. It's a somber mood here at greendale high as parents and classmates trapped by hurricane Catherine fear for their missing friend. I'm surrounded by worried students who... What are you looking for? These kids know more about Melissa than any adult. You know what kids don't do? They don't tell adults anything. This kid's got a crush on her. That girl just wants to be on tv... ooh. Well, look what we have here. What about her? She knows something. Who is this? It's Walter. I know. Walter, I was doing that thing that you always... What do you want? Hey, can you get over to greendale high school? Why would I do that? Melissa Welling? The missing girl? Walter, don't. Look, I want to find her, and you know the police aren't really gonna look for her until after the hurricane, so it's up to me. Yeah, but you're stuck on looking glass key. Yeah, I know that, which is why I need you to be my eyes and my ears and my feet and my arms and my elbows and my spleen... Walter, I get it. What do I do when I get there? Well, most of the student body's in the school auditorium. You want me to interrogate an entire auditorium? Or you can find a girl in an army surplus coat with too much eye shadow and get her alone. She gives you any trouble, threaten to search her for ecstasy. I don't know where Melissa is. I already told the teachers that. Claire, this isn't for the news or for your teachers. This is for real. I'm a federal agent. Then why are you hawking at me? Do you know Melissa Welling? Yeah, but we don't exactly do the same things. What do you mean? I do things, and Melissa doesn't. Are you referring to boys or drugs? Heh. Melissa doesn't do anything. She studies. She belongs to clubs. She plays some sort of flute thing in the band. Melissa's sincere. Me and Melissa don't hang. She knows something. Threaten her with your gun. You know what I think, Claire? I think you're sincere, too. I think you want to tell me something about Melissa, but you're afraid you're gonna get in trouble. You won't. I just need to find Melissa. Ok, going with kindness. It's radical, but... What I saw... Mm-hmm. Right? Ok. So... like, a week ago, I was behind the library during fifth period. You said I won't get in trouble. I promise. Well, I go back there sometimes, you know, to deal. Ecstasy? How do you know that? Called it! Let's just call it a hunch. Look, I don't care about any of that. What can you tell me about Melissa? Ok, so I went behind the library, and I saw Melissa, which is weird. Uh, Melissa's more an in-the-library kind of girl than behind the library, right? Yeah, and this older guy pulls up in this van and starts talking to her. Very creep city. Can you... whoa, whoa. What kind of van? Ahem. Sorry. I was distracted by something very annoying. Can you describe the van? Pale blue, crappy. And the thing is I think maybe I saw the same thing in the parking lot this morning. Did you see Melissa today? No, but we were all outside, checking out the storm. Ok. None of the school security cameras caught Melissa today. We already checked. Good to know. Hey, we don't need security cameras. We got teenagers with cell phones and social media. Hey, Willa. You know all about, uh, facespace and the, uh, tweetbook, and, uh, what's that called? Upchucking your status? None of those are things. Yeah, I need photos posted up by greendale high school students today. Don't mind me. Theoretically one could do such things, but personally, I would never try it, because it would violate the terms of my probation. Right. That's worth a clipboard note. Ok, tell me exactly what would get you into trouble. And talk slowly. I would get in big trouble logging in under my name... willamonday, all one word... which I haven't used in a year. Yeah, like that. And I'd really be in hot water if I entered Melissa Welling's name into the search box, found her page... Yeah. And then scrolled to the images tab. Images. Images page. What ta... Images! Ah. Images. Yeah. Right. And then selected greendale's recent photos. No. Nope. Nope. Nope. Anything? Nah. Claire said they all took photos of the storm. Where are those? Oh, what is that? A shoe? There are hundreds of photos here. Here we go. Got some of the storm. Ok, we just have to find some that are facing the right angle. It's... Blue van. Blue van. There. Look. Oh! Good eye, mean lady. Come on. Come on. Wait. Look at that. There's our girl. Melissa Welling? Are you sure? Yep. You can blow it up. Click there. Yeah. That's her, all right. She's moving toward the van. Now to get the plates, we'll just need a better angle of the van. Oh, God. Who is she talking to? The driver. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Walter, stop saying, "uh-oh." What are you seeing? Seems like she got in the van. Melissa Welling didn't disappear in the hurricane. She was abducted. Ms. Welling. I want to thank you. I thought that with this hurricane, I was worried no one would look for my daughter. I just have to ask you a few questions about Melissa. Yes. Of course. Has she been acting unusual lately? Distant? Wait. Um, they said Melissa was swept off a bridge. Why are you asking me about her state of mind? You know, it's best not to make any assumptions when it's a missing persons case. Oh, no, no. She... she's a good kid. She... she's happy. And she's never talked about a man? A... a man? No. Melissa is only 14 years old. She doesn't even have a boyfriend. These questions, what are you asking? Mrs. Welling, is it possible that Melissa was in a relationship with an older man? No, absolutely not. Has she been on the Internet more lately? Any sign of a personality change? Anything at all? Ms. Welling. There was some money that went missing from my purse a few days ago. How much? $300. It must have been Melissa. But she does not do drugs. Please find her. Please find my little girl. Here's another. Still no clean shot of the license plate, but look what you can see as the van turns. What's with the stoner paint job? Looks like a snake. A windowless van with a snake painted on it. Wouldn't it be simpler to just write "rape mobile" instead? I knew a boy had a van like that in high school. I was very impressed. Was he 40? No, he was 17. And you were? Uh, 15, 16. Why? Once Walter starts looking for something, he finds out a lot of things nobody wants him to find out. About what age would a girl stop loving a snake van? Oh, eh, 17, 18 at the most. I mean, you grow up, right? The missing girl is only 14. Eww. The guy trolls for nubiles in a snake van. Except what if... what if this snake was, uh, some sort of logo? Who has a snake logo? A pet store. Oh, caduceus. You know, the medical logo with the snake and the staff and the wings. Plumbing. Rooter snake. The snake that cleans out clogged pipes. It's a plumber's van. All we have to do is figure out what plumber uses this particular logo. Plumbers. Power snaking. Images. South Miami heights. Attagirl. Uh, Willa, you're not supposed to have Internet access. Oh, sorry for... Identifying the kidnapper of a missing girl in the middle of a hurricane? I got an emergency call from a... Mrs. Zambada? You're Pete Steck, plumber? I get double for emergency calls. What do you need unclogged? Ah. Yeah, I got a blue van. Does he look like a predator? Definitely. Definitely got a blue van. I know my colors. What were you doing in a school parking lot earlier? I get called all the time to unclog the pipes here. You got no idea what high school students put down those drains. I, uh, thought I'd swing by and see if they needed anything before the storm. Really? Who'd you talk to? I can't remember exactly. Where was he between being at the school before and being there now? From the smell, I'd say somebody was smoking weed in his van, waiting for the storm to pass. I'm here because it's an evacuation center. It's the safest place to be. And it's full of high school girls. What? Melissa could be in the back of his van. Where's your van? It's in the staff parking lot. What's going on? Jump all over him. If I check your van, what are we gonna find? Nothing. Yeah? You mind if I look for myself? Yeah, I do. Say her name. Pete, am I gonna find Melissa Welling? I never even met the girl. Ah, that's not what you say when you don't know somebody. Shut up. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. I want a lawyer. Can't talk to him anymore. I'm a cop. He's asking for a lawyer. Who are you talking to? I'm not a cop. Put me on speaker. Mr. Steck, I'm gonna say a word, and I want you to shout out the first thought that pops into your head. Ready? Who is this now? Dracula. Vampire. Pineapple. Is this legal? It's not illegal. Pineapple. I... Snow. Want... Hobo. A... Caramel. Lawyer! Making some great headway there, Walter. Thank you. Just go look at his van. I can't, not without his permission or a warrant. Well, sometimes the right thing isn't the legal thing, Isabel. Is... You stay right there. I'm coming back for you. Mmm. Thank you. You put away your clipboard. I beg your pardon? You understood that Willa got caught up in the search for that girl, maybe because you did, too. I did not. You spotted that blue van. If that girl is inside it, you saved her life. Well, maybe I just need to be open to the way you people do things around here. Timo. What happened? Your trailer blew over. Had to crawl through the window. This building is nailed down, right? Are you all right? Yeah, but I wouldn't go into your bathroom anytime soon. Timo Proud? Who are you? My probation officer. Oh. You're her. Mm-hmm. You were hiding in the bathroom, right? I should have checked. I'm her cousin. No, you're not. You're a gypsy, so you say that you're her cousin. So, what? Are you gonna put this in your report now, too? I think all our energies would be better spent saving that missing girl. Don't you, Mr. proud? Absolutely. Which girl? There's no way Pete Steck stays where I left him, Walter. Why? He knows you didn't find a girl in his van. That doesn't mean he didn't kill her and hide her body someplace else. The everglades are just a few miles away. Still here. Where else am I supposed to go? It's a hurricane. There's nobody in your van. I know. Why didn't you just give me permission to look? I don't know. I'm running out of ideas here. Maybe there's something else in his van he doesn't want you to find. Isabel, ask to see his wallet. I'm gonna leave now. Why? Because you don't have the right to hold me here. His wallet, Isabel. I do have a right to see your identification, and if you don't provide it, I can hold you. Whatever. Got it. Yeah, 'cause you grabbed it out of my hand. You said that Melissa stole 300 bucks from her mother. Where'd you get this? I do a mostly cash business. We can prove that you got this from Melissa Welling. Oh, you brilliant lying liar. You killed that girl, and you took her money. I didn't kill her. She's missing, presumed dead, and you have her cash. You killed that little girl. I didn't do it! Where did you get her money, huh? Ok, wait for it. Gun. I sold her a gun for 300 bucks. A 14-year-old girl buys a gun and then disappears into a hurricane. Suicide? Why buy a gun? Drugs are so much easier to get and cheaper. You think maybe she bought the gun for somebody else? Oh, a boy? You need to talk to her mother again. I did. She said there's no boy. Besides, that woman doesn't know the first thing about her own daughter. Walter, I have to call you back. I-Isabel? Ms. Welling, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to hear that. Where's my daughter? Stop. What did you do to my daughter? Karyn. Where is my little girl?! I didn't do nothing, I swear. I didn't do nothing. Please, please, just tell me where she is. Enough. I won't press charges. Please. I'm gonna take you out of here. What's that? It's a printout of Melissa's social networking profile. Like the whole thing? News feeds, friends, friends of friends, photos. No computers, Walter style. It is enlightening and disgusting what kids'll put up on their social networking sites. I mean, it's one of the main ways I keep an eye on my probationers. Printing it on paper isn't really how the Internet is supposed to work. Girl lost in a hurricane. Go. Ok, wait a minute. What are we looking for? A reason this girl would buy a gun. That's easy. It's either an abuser or an angry boyfriend or an enemy. Heh. "Nicole Polizzi is such a slut." Nicole Polizzi? You found the enemy already? No. That's just Snooki. No idea in the world. Never mind. Moving on. This Renae chick has 110 friends in common with Melissa. Walter wants enemies, not friends. They have over 100 friends in common, but Renae and Melissa aren't friends themselves. Does that make them enemies? I'd bet on it. We need to find Renae's profile and look for clues. Renae. Renae, Renae, Renae. She bought the gun from Mr. Steck. A gun? Melissa bought a gun? She used the $300 she stole from you. Th-there's no proof that she stole that money. Mrs. Welling, I need for you to live in the real world so that we can help your daughter. Can you do that? Uh-huh. Is there a boy, somebody she would buy a gun for? N-no. No, there's no boy. Girls do things for boys at this age. Think. I don't know. You're right. I... I don't know anything about my own daughter. I'm sorry. You know why computers are better than paper? The search function. Where's the sport in that? Wait. I've got something. What is it? One of Renae's friends tagged her in a post. 400 friends? Who's got 400 friends? They're not like friend friends. They're people who... never mind. Just look. Melissa. It's some kind of video, right? Yeah, we need to see that footage. By the way, I don't sleep with timo. Yeah, she doesn't. Why should I believe you? Willa and timo are more like brother and sister. But someone with your experience in the real world should be able to recognize the difference. Ok, here's the video. This is a video that one of Renae's nonfriend friend's posted. Melissa, our missing girl. Whoa! Oh. Fight back, bitch. Fight back! Come on! Bitch. Get up. What? Huh? Get up. Someone did that to me, I'd buy a gun, too. Bitch. Get up. Get up. Get up. Fight back, bitch. - Whoa. Whoa. - I know that girl beating the crap out of Melissa. Her name is Renae. Renae, uh... Francis. Who is this? What the Walter, Walter? You called me. Melissa was being physically abused by a bully, a girl named Renae Francis. I know Renae Francis. She has been in and out of the system more times than I can count. Excuse me. If I can get on to the department database, then I can get her last known residence. Renae Francis. She's probably in the auditorium. If we can find Renae, maybe we can find our missing girl. Walter? Hello? Isabel. Walter. Walter? Isabel. Isabel, hello. The Internet's down. Ah, we lost power. Well, looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way. What way have we been doing it so far? That last lightning strike fried my generator. I got a generator in my workshop. It's hooked to a bicycle. It takes a half-hour to generate enough power to make toast. All right, listen up, everybody. Obviously we're gonna have power out for a little while, but we still haven't found Melissa Welling. And we are stranded in a bar at the end of the world. Ends of the earth. All right, the point is how are we gonna keep looking? We are gonna become our own human search engine. All right, 14-year-old girl gets bullied and buys a gun. What's next? She shoots a bully. She could have bought the gun purely for defense. I'm with Mrs. Farrel. I'd go looking for Renae and shoot her in the back. We're just spitballing here. I'd use the gun for defense, to show, scare off the bully. Melissa Welling is a good girl. She bought a gun. Abuse can lead to incredible violence. The worm turns. I've got some personal experience with this. Being a bully? No. I think you can understand, Mr. Knox, that what we do in our lives is not a coincidence. I was a very good girl. And then somebody... somebody very bad in my life, and I attacked him in his sleep. There. You are not the only one who has ever been on probation. Ok. Let's just assume that Melissa went hunting for Renae. So shouldn't you be nicer and more concerned now? See, I am who I am today because my probation officer... You know what? It's none of your business. Schools have metal detectors. Right. So Melissa couldn't have brought the gun into school. She's not old enough to drive, so it's not in her car. Police didn't find it in her backpack. She kept it with her and lured Renae somewhere private. Off the school grounds so she wouldn't get caught. We already know the place. We saw it. The place where Melissa got beat up. An excellent place to kill someone. Especially in a hurricane. But we don't know where that place is. We can't recheck the video. I never even saw it in the first place. All right, you know what? It seemed like it was, um, a tunnel. What, for cars? A pedestrian tunnel, an excellent place to kill someone. All right, human search engine, I need details. There were yum yum burger wrappers all over the ground. Why would you notice that? Leo used to be fat. People change. I was fat. I changed. You used to be a murderer. You changed. Willa used to be a thief, and she's changed. I hope not too much. Thieving is the family business. I was not a murderer. The guy that I attacked didn't die. It was just... It's none of your business. Is there a yum yum burger near greendale high? Well, there's one near the courthouse. There's one on dyer street. One on crown. One at the town center mall. Heh. And two on speedway boulevard. One at leisure lake, but that burned down. I used to love yum yum. Sounds, people. Sounds. Did anybody hear anything in the video? Except for Melissa crying? Bells. Church bells? I don't know. I'm not churchy. Well, are there any other kind of bells? My and my cousin Cosmo did a bell-tuning scam. You conned churches? We cleaned and tuned bells. You can't tune bells. All right, focus! Girl with a gun in a hurricane. Sacred mother still rings bells, and there's a methodist place, too. All right, so we're looking for a church near a yum yum burger that's closer to the oven than the fridge. What? The... the sponge! Melissa's backpack. Melissa finds Renae. They argue. Renae takes Melissa's backpack and tosses it down a storm drain. Ends up south of the bridge. All right, so we're looking for a tunnel that is south of spaghetti bridge. What's the church on 320th street and canal? St. Jacob's. There's a yum yum burger on palm and north canal. That's a small area to search. I need to call Isabel. Wait. Uh, you don't have a phone. I got a ham radio. And how are you gonna power it Walter has his toast generator. Where? At his place. It's 5 minutes away. Yeah, though 140-mile-an-hour wind. That's why I'm puttin' on my windbreaker. You're very negative. You and me, Walter. Great job, human Internet. I'll be back when I need you all to search for some porn. I never loved you, Catherine! Things were so bad that instead of coming to me, my daughter bought a gun. Looks that way. And then she stole from me to buy that gun. Why didn't she come to me? She must have been in so much pain, and I... I had no idea. I just feel so... helpless. Stormycakes, this is señor Cyclone. Do you read me? Walter? How'd you get on this frequency? Shortwave, and I prefer señor Cyclone. Do you have power? Not for long, we don't. I think I know where Melissa is. Oh, thank God. It's about a half a mile from the school. There's some kind of pedestrian tunnel where kids hang out. It's within earshot of St. Jacob's, and the 320th street canal. Real close to yum yum burger. Yeah, there should be a storm drain nearby. I'm on it. Stay here. Catherine's eye should be over you soon. That gives you a half-hour, maybe 45 minutes where you won't die. Thanks for the pep talk, Walter. This is señor Cyclone, over and out. Come on. Give me something. Ok, there's the storm drain. Oh, no. Melissa! Walter, I found a puddle of blood, storm drain, and a. 22-caliber shell casing. Well, that's the caliber of gun that Pete Steck sold Melissa, right? Yeah, but we don't know whose blood it is. Maybe the mean girl took the gun from Melissa, shot her, and then drove off. Or maybe Melissa snapped and took revenge on her bully. Well, does Renae have a car? She's got a student parking spot. Nobody knows where she is. One of 'em shoots the other. Then they both leave. Yeah, but which direction? If you go east, there's nothing but marsh and everglades. That's the perfect place to dump a body. What's west? Offices, fast food joints, a church, hospital. Walter, we only have about 20 minutes left before the eye passes. There's no time. Tell me which way to go. Give me 5 minutes. We got 2 girls in a car, one badly hurt. Which way do they go? Toward the everglades to dump the body. Depends who got shot. All right, let's say there's a 50% chance that Renae did the shooting. Then there's a 100% chance that Renae will dump Melissa's body in the everglades. But there's a 50% chance that Melissa did the shooting. Then it's a 50% chance that Melissa's driving to the everglades, which adds up to a 75% probability that they are driving to the everglades. Timo, you can do Walter math. We all know what Renae would do. The mystery here is Melissa. What do you see? This girl bought a gun. She stole money. She lied to those who cared about her. She hid her pain from the world, and she lashed out. Walter, forget the math. It's about what's in the girl's heart. Now, despite everything that's happened, despite all of her bad decisions, I am certain this girl has a good heart. I don't think you can go wrong making that assumption. Leo, you take timo and go to my place and radio Isabel. Tell her what? Tell her to forget the everglades. We should assume Melissa was trying to take Renae to the hospital. Renae. You have to stay awake. Keep your eyes open. Someone's coming. Can anybody hear me? Melissa? Yes, there's two of us, and Renae's bleeding real bad. Please help us. Look, there's a cable on top of your car. If you touch the car and the road at the same time, you will get electrocuted. Do you understand me? Yeah, but there's so much blood because I-I just wanted to show her the gun, but she tried to grab it from me. And I skidded, and I crashed, and I'm so sorry. Melissa, honey, try to stay calm, ok? Just keep it together. W-what do you want me to do? Stay still so I can figure out what to do with these electrical lines. Called it. Oh, thank God. I'm glad you're here. 2 girls. They're both hurt. One of them's bleeding to death. All right, we got about 10 minutes before the eye passes. There's a live power cable on top of that car. How do we get to them? I got an idea. Stay here. Yeah.

Yeah, this is the part that Leo takes care of. Walter would want me to tell you you're welcome, and he wants the best for you and your daughter. Come on, guys. Let's go.
