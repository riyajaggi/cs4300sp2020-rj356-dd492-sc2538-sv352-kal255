Good morning, Ms. Ingram. ‐[ British accent ] Thanks for having me. ‐lt's been a long road getting here. ‐Yes, eight years since NASA awarded us the Mars contract. Eight very challenging years. ‐Walk us through what we can expect in the days and months ahead. ‐Gladly. Once the crew has achieved orbit, they'll dock with the Mars Transit Vehicle. The astronauts will climb aboard and conduct what we call a shakedown ‐‐ a rigorous series of diagnostic tests ‐‐ and then they'll initiate the first long burn, sending them on their way. Seven months later, they'll arrive at Mars, descend to the surface, spend 18 months before they launch in the MAV back to the Transit Vehicle and make their journey home.
