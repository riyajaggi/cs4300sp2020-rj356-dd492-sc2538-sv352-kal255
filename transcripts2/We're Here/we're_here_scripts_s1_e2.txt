COME TO THE SHOW, TELL YOUR -- OH, YOU THREW MY FLYER ON THE GROUND. IT'S A FREE SHOW, IT'S ON THURSDAY, COME SEE US. OH, WE GOTTA COME DOWN THAT STAIRCASE, HOLD ON, DID SOMEBODY SAY YOU WERE SERVING COFFEE? DO YOU LIKE YOUR COFFEE BLACK? OR WITH EXTRA CREAM? HEAVY CREAM. BOOM. YOU GOTTA DUCK, YOU GOTTA DUCK. YES. YES. OH, THANK YOU, SIS. OH, MY GOODNESS. WE ARE IN THE MAGIC VALLEY, SPECIFICALLY IN TWIN FALLS, IDAHO. HOW CAN I DESCRIBE THIS TOWN? IT'S COUNTRY AS HELL IN TWIN FALLS, OKAY? IT'S A VERY CONSERVATIVE AREA, IT'S -- HAS A VERY HIGH MORMON POPULATION, WHICH, HISTORICALLY, IS NOT SUPER OPEN TO THOSE OF US IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE. ALL RIGHT, MARY. OH, COME ON, CAMP, HONEY. I'M HOME. ME AND THE GIRLS, WE BRING OUR CAMP EVERYWHERE WITH US BECAUSE WE NEED OUR SPACE. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO, LEOPARD, THAT'S VERY LAQUIFA, YES. WE'RE DIVAS. THANK GOD I BROUGHT THESE. SO, WE NEED OUR OWN AREAS, THAT ARE DRESSED UP FOR US. MY CROWN, WHICH I DESERVE. I LIKE BIG HAIR, I LIKE COSTUMES. LITTLE SNACKS. I LOVE HOLLYWOOD, IT'S GLAMOROUS, IT'S ELIZABETH TAYLOR. OH, I FEEL LIKE MARY POPPINS TODAY. IT'S GOT MAKEUP, IT'S GOT MIRRORS, SPARKLES. YES. DRAMA. LIKE, THIS PLACE IS FIERCE, AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL FIERCE. HONEY, WE'RE BRINGING DRAG TO PEOPLE OF TWIN FALLS. OH, MY GOD. OH. ALL IN A GAY'S WORK. WHERE WE GOING? WE'RE GOING TO THE ORPHEUM, THEY DO AN ANNUAL DRAG SHOW. SO, WE'RE GONNA WATCH THE REHEARSAL, THIS IS A NICE-LOOKING THEATER. WAIT, WE'RE MEETING YOUR DAUGHTERS? YES, HONEY. WE SHOULD BE QUIET SO THEY'RE UNAWARE. SO, MUCH TO MY SURPRISE, THERE ACTUALLY IS A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY OF DRAG QUEENS IN TWIN FALLS. I WANNA TALK TO HER ABOUT STAGE PRESENCE. YEAH, I WENT TO SLEEP TWICE. IF YOU'RE GONNA COME OUT, YOU NEED TO CHANNEL MARIA CALLAS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THINK ABOUT, LIKE, A FIERCE OPERA DIVA. SHE CAN HIT A NOTE. THERE ARE ELEMENTS THERE. IT'S NOT STARTING FROM SCRATCH. THERE'S POTENTIAL. CLUTCH MY PEARLS. YOUR BABY IS A HO, MAMA. THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELLS YOU. THE POWER OF CHRIST -- I KNOW ALL ABOUT BEING A BABY DRAG, AND ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES, OF COURSE, I'M NOT JUDGING, BUT, I SEE, ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES. THERE IS IMPROVEMENT TO BE MADE. IN THEIR DEFENSE, I WON "DRAG RACE" WHEN I WAS ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES. BITCH, YOU STILL ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES. I WAS GONNA SAY, ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES. I'M, LIKE, THE ONLY CLEAN ONE HERE. WATCHING THESE REHEARSALS, I'M NOT GONNA LIE, SOME OF THESE QUEENS, I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER WORD, A LITTLE CRUNCHY. THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE. BUT THERE'S TALENT HERE, I'M HOPING THAT I CAN HELP MAKE THEM THE TRUE IMAGE OF THEIR MIND. SOMETIMES, YOU CAN'T BECOME WHAT YOU SEE IN YOUR MIND, UNTIL HAVE THE SKILLS TO MAKE IT. ARE YOU CLOSE FRIENDS? Y'ALL SEE EACH OTHER EVERY DAY? HOW OFTEN DO YOU ALL SEE EACH OTHER? ONCE A WEEK, OR -- NO, I WISH IT WAS MORE OFTEN THAN THAT. IT'S MORE LIKE EVERY OTHER MONTH. OH, MY GOD, WHAT'S INTERESTING IS, I MEAN, I GUESS, IN MY MIND, I SAW YOU ALL, YOU STARTED PERFORMING, YOU KNOW, I WAS, LIKE, OH, THEY'RE ALWAYS HANGING OUT. LIKE, THIS IS JUST ANOTHER DAY, THEY'RE, LIKE, OH, THE GIRLS SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN, BUT YOU CAN GO, LIKE, WEEKS AT A TIME WITHOUT SEEING ANOTHER GAY PERSON. THAT IS INSANE. OH, EASILY. YEAH. MONTHS, YEAH. WE'RE ALL, LIKE, SEPARATED, AND WE DON'T, LIKE, GET TOGETHER. I WORK GRAVEYARD, AND THAT RESTRICTS A LOT OF IT, I JUST DON'T GET OUT MUCH, LIKE, THIS IS WEIRD TO BE OUT IN THE DAYLIGHT WITH THE DAY WALKERS, LIKE, I'M JUST THE LITTLE GLAMOUR GHOUL THAT STAYS IN MY CAVERN. BUT YET IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO MAKE A QUEEN. SO, IN AN EFFORT TO CREATE COMMUNITY WITHIN YOUR COMMUNITY, I WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU THREE TO CREATE, LIKE, A FIERCE DRAG SHOW. IN HELPING YOU PUT TOGETHER A FIERCE, PHENOMENAL, FUCKING, SUPER DIVA GROUP. AND I WANNA KNOW IF Y'ALL ARE ON BOARD WITH THAT? YEAH. 100%. MISS AMELIA? OF COURSE. I'M HOPING THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BOND TOGETHER, TO BE ON THIS PUBLIC STAGE, IN FRONT OF THEIR PEERS, AND I'M TRYING TO MAKE A POWERFUL GROUP OF QUEERS SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE OUT INTO THE TOWN OF TWIN FALLS, IDAHO. YOU KNOW, I WASN'T ALWAYS A GREAT PERSON. I'M STILL NOT A GREAT PERSON, BUT I'M -- I'M TRYING TO DO A LOT BETTER. I REMEMBER THERE BEING A COUPLE OF, OF GAY INDIVIDUALS IN HIGH SCHOOL, BUT THEY WEREN'T REALLY OUT ABOUT IT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST ASKING TO GET BEAT UP. I WAS ALWAYS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT KIND OF THREW AROUND THOSE SLURS, BUT THAT WAS KIND OF, MY VIEW, THAT WAS GROWING UP. IT WAS, THEY'RE BAD PEOPLE, THEY'RE NOT GOOD PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, GOOD PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HUH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? AFTER GROWING UP AND LOOKING BACK ON IT, YEAH, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPROACH THAT. OH, THE LOG TAVERN. OH, THIS IS GONNA BE FUN. IT'S LIKE HOME, I HOPE THEY'RE READY. OH, HI. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO MEET YOU, CLIFTON. OH, CAN I SIT WITH YOU GUYS? ABSOLUTELY. COME ON, PLEASE. IS THAT ICE IN YOUR BEER? YES. MAMA, YOU ARE A TRUE SOUTHERN LADY. ARE WE IN THE SOUTH? WHERE ARE WE? NO. WE'RE HERE RIGHT NOW. THIS IS VERY SOUTHERN THOUGH, LIKE, I COME FROM EAST TENNESSEE, SO, LIKE, SUPER EAST TENNESSEE, LIKE, WHERE DOLLY PARTON'S FROM. I'M CURIOUS, WHY DO YOU WANNA GET IN DRAG? LIKE, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO YOU, HONESTLY? ALL RIGHT. GROWING UP, THE WAY THAT WE WERE ALL RAISED, BEING GAY, THAT WAS JUST SHUNNED. YOU DON'T SPEND YOUR TIME HANGING OUT WITH THEM AND, AND THEY'RE ALL ON THE WRONG PATH AND WHATNOT. AND THEN, ONCE GETTING INTO TWIN AND HAVING A FEW FRIENDS, YOU KNOW, ENDED UP BEING GAY AND THEY'RE JUST, LIKE, GREAT PEOPLE, ALL THE WAY ROUND. THEY'RE NOT BAD PEOPLE. THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS, SO, NOW, I DON'T KNOW, I'M KIND OF LIVING, LIKE, A NO-HOLDS-BARRED, KIND OF, LIKE, SOMETHING GETS PRESENTED TO ME, IF I HAVE ANY RESERVATIONS WHATSOEVER, THEN I FEEL AS THOUGH I SHOULD JUST MEET THOSE HEAD ON. YEAH. AND THIS IS YOUR BOYFRIEND, RIGHT? THIS IS MY MAN. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM DOING DRAG? DUDE, I'M SO EXCITED. YEAH? AS LONG AS YOU KEEP HIS CHEST HAIR TO, LIKE, RIGHT HERE. YOU CAN BRING IT DOWN. OH. I WILL ACTUALLY MAKE A DEAL. IF YOU LET ME SHAVE HIS BEARD, HE CAN KEEP ALL HIS CHEST HAIR. HE CAN SHAVE HIS BEARD. BUT I WANNA SEE ALL THAT FACE, 'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA MAKE HIM A WOMAN. I AM GONNA STEAL YOU. I JUST WANT TO CHAT A LITTLE BIT. NO, HOLD ON. RIGHT NOW YOU ARE STILL THE MAN. SO I AM GOING TO LET YOU HOLD THE DOOR FOR YOUR MOTHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WANNA SEE WHAT YOUR IMPRESSION OF A RUNWAY WALK, AS A DRAG QUEEN. GIVE ME YOUR BEST WOMAN WALK. I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT. ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT TITTIES ON. OH, OKAY, SHE'S GIVING ME A LITTLE PIECE. OH, A LITTLE MORE, OH, ANOTHER PIECE. OKAY. SHE IS DEFINITELY A MAN. YOU GUYS, SHE IS A MAN. GIVE ME YOUR BUTCH QUEEN REALNESS, YOUR BUTCH QUEEN. THAT WAS WAY TOO DUDE, GIRL, YOU GOTTA LET IT GO. AH, WAY TOO DUDE. SHAKE THE BOY OUT. I WANT YOU TO REALLY TURN INTO A WHOLE 'NOTHER PERSON THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WAS IN THERE. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE AS SOMETHING THAT'S FUN, WHICH I THINK YOU WILL, BUT ALSO BE OPEN-MINDED, BECAUSE THERE'S A CHARACTER THAT'S GONNA COME OUT. THERE'S GONNA BE THIS FEMALE PART OF YOU. ALL RIGHT. JUST ALLOW IT TO COME OUT, YOU KNOW? THAT'S TOTALLY FINE. WHAT ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT ANYTHING? NO, NOT REALLY. WHAT ABOUT TUCKING? YOU'RE NOT NERVOUS ABOUT THAT? WELL, YEAH, OBVIOUSLY, I GOTTA DO IT. YOU'RE GONNA DO IT. OBVIOUSLY. OKAY, COOL. BUT THERE AIN'T NO TAPE INVOLVED RIGHT? OH, NO, THERE'S DUCT TAPE INVOLVED. KIDDING? NOT FOR THAT SPECIFIC -- FOR YOUR PENIS, YES. DUCT TAPE. ABSOLUTELY. ON THE PECKER? YES. SO. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. FOR A CISGENDER, STRAIGHT MALE, THERE'S FEAR, WHICH HAPPENS VERY NATURALLY, THAT PEOPLE ARE GONNA THINK HE'S, LIKE, "OH, HE'S BI-CURIOUS." YOU KNOW, OR "IT'S TESTING HIS MASCULINITY." WHICH TODAY, I GOT TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT NERVOUSNESS AND FEAR, OF MAYBE SHOWING A MORE FEMININE SIDE, AND I THINK THAT IT'S TIME FOR US TO PUSH ALL THE WAY THAT DIRECTION THAT HE'S NERVOUS AND AFRAID TO GO TO. FAIR ENOUGH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. IT WAS SO GOOD MEETING YOU. OH, FIERCE, HEY, SIS. GOOD MORNING. OH, MY GOODNESS, I DIDN'T THINK YOU WAS EVER GONNA MAKE IT. YOU LOOK GOOD. GOOD MORNING, SIR, HOW ARE YOU? GOOD. GOOD, AWESOME. WE'RE JUST VISITING IN TOWN. WE'RE HAVING, LIKE, A HUGE DRAG SHOW. SO IT'S GONNA BE TONS OF DIFFERENT ACTS, LOTS OF FUN, AND MAYBE EVEN SOME BALLOONS AND CONFETTI. I'M RUNNING AROUND 'CAUSE WE'RE DOING A SHOW. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. I THINK I'VE GOT A... OTHER PLANS? FOOTBALL PLANS. OH, FOOTBALL PLANS. BASICALLY, WE'RE DOING THIS SHOW, ARE Y'ALL GONNA COME? I'M SORRY, WE'RE BUSY. WHY, WHAT YOU DOING? MAY I LEAVE A FLYER WITH YOU, AT LEAST? FOR OUR EVENT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO LOOK AT IT? NO? PUT IT OUT THERE. OKAY, ALL RIGHT, WE'LL PUT IT ON THE WINDOW. Y'ALL HAVE A GOOD DAY, GOOD LUCK. I'VE HAD A LOT OF GAYS WORK FOR ME IN MY BUSINESS. OH, REALLY, WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS DO YOU HAVE? I HAD A COFFEE SHOP. OH, COOL, WELL, YOU KNOW, GAYS LOVE COFFEE. NOW, I HEARD THAT Y'ALL, Y'ALL HEARD ABOUT THE LADY WALKING ROUND WITH THE WHIP. OH, WE SAW. IN FACT, I WAS HAVING LUNCH IN DUNCAN'S ON THE CORNER AND EVERYBODY'S, "WHAT THE HELL?" SHE BAM, BAM. CAN I TELL YOU A SECRET? THAT WAS ME. OKAY. IF IT'S NOT BULL RIDING OR, OR, IT'S NOT WESTERNS, WE USUALLY DON'T SEE IT. OH, REALLY? WELL, WE DID A WHOLE LIKE WESTERN THEME WITH OUR COSTUMES. I WORE DENIM YESTERDAY. I AM COMING. YOU ARE? YEAH, MY DAUGHTER WILL COME WITH ME. ARE Y'ALL COMING, TOO? HE PROBABLY WON'T. WHY NOT? IT'S NOT YOUR THING? NO, NOT REALLY. YOU SHOULD DRESS HIM UP. YEAH, YOU WANT ME TO DRESS YOU UP? NO. OH, MY GOD. WHY NOT? I GOT A PERFECT PERIWINKLE THAT WILL BE LOVELY ON THOSE. GIVE ME A SNAP, SNAP, SNAP. YEAH. I LIVE. I GREW UP IN A WHITE, MIDDLE CLASS, LDS FAMILY, AND HERE IN TWIN FALLS, THAT'S, LIKE, THE DREAM. TESTOSTERONE IS LIKE THE THING THAT'S HELPING ME BE ME, BUT I AM SO SCARED OF NEEDLES. EVER SINCE I WAS 11, I HATED MY BREASTS. I HAD THESE HORRIBLE THOUGHTS, LIKE, IF I START TO CUT THEM OFF BY MYSELF, SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO FINISH IT, RIGHT? THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED MY WHOLE LIFE, AND IT'S INTERESTING HOW I FINALLY GET TO, GET TO SEE THE PERSON THAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS GONNA GROW UP TO BE. THIS WAS NOT A WANT, THIS WAS A NEED. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD DEAL WITH THESE THESE SCARS. BUT, TO ME, THIS IS JUST, WELL, THIS JUST REMINDS ME THAT MY HAPPINESS IS SO MUCH MORE THAN WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WANT IT TO BE. I WANTED THESE SCARS. HELLO. OH, MY GOD. HEY. HOW ARE YOU? I'M GOOD. OKAY, YOU MUST BE BRANDON. YES. HI, I'M SHANGELA. IT IS SO NICE TO MEET YOU. HI. YOU MUST BE THE GORGEOUS MIKAYLA? YES. IT'S SO GREAT TO MEET YOU. WELL, THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT, THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'S NICE TO MEET Y'ALL, TOO. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME IN YOUR HOME. AND I'M EXCITED TO MEET Y'ALL. HOW DID THE TWO OF YOU MEET? WE MET IN HIGH SCHOOL. I WALKED THROUGH THE BAND ROOM DOORS, AND SHE WAS PROBABLY JUST RIGHT ACROSS FROM ME, AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM. WHEN I SAW HER, I FELT LIKE I ALREADY KNEW HER, BUT I'D NEVER MET HER BEFORE. SO, YOU'RE COMING THROUGH THE BAND ROOM, THIS IS LIKE A ROM-COM, LIKE, I'M LIVING FOR THIS MOMENT. YOU'RE THERE WITH LIKE A VIOLIN, OR A PERCUSSION PIECE, AND YOU'RE COMING THROUGH WITH DRUMSTICKS. BUT, OKAY, SO, YOU GUYS MET, AND THEN, DID YOU START DATING AT THAT TIME? OR? NO, ACTUALLY, WE GREW UP IN THE MORMON COMMUNITY, THE LDS COMMUNITY. WHEN WE WERE STILL IN THE CHURCH, TWO WOMEN, BECAUSE I HAD NOT TRANSITIONED YET, TWO GIRLS DATING WAS LIKE A HUGE NO. I WAS REALLY TERRIFIED TO TELL MY PARENTS, 'CAUSE I WAS AFRAID THAT I WAS GOING TO DISOWN ME, BECAUSE MY WHOLE LIFE, THEY KIND OF RAISED ME VERY STRICT IN THE CHURCH. SO, I WAS KIND OF PUTTING THAT OFF UNTIL WE WERE ENGAGED. AND I, YEAH, I DROPPED A BOMBSHELL ON MY PARENTS, BASICALLY TELLING THEM I LEFT THE CHURCH, I'M GETTING MARRIED TO BRANDON, BY THE WAY, HE'S BRANDON. WHEN OUR FAMILIES FINALLY DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO BE INVOLVED, WHEN WE WERE PLANNING THE WEDDING, THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS THAT WERE JUST LIKE, NO, NO, NO, YOU CAN'T DO THIS, YOU CAN'T DO THAT, YOU CAN'T INVITE THESE PEOPLE. ORIGINALLY, WITH MY PARENTS, THEY WEREN'T GOING TO COME AT ALL, MOST OF MY FRIENDS, THEY WEREN'T GONNA COME, AND SO, IT WAS JUST BASICALLY, LIKE, WHAT'S THE POINT? MY DAD DIDN'T WALK ME DOWN THE AISLE IN ORDER TO, KIND OF, SHOW THAT THEY STILL HOLD FIRMLY TO THEIR BELIEFS. EVEN THOUGH THEY CAME TO OUR WEDDING, IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS THAT THEY WERE UNHAPPY THE WHOLE TIME, AND AS MUCH AS I KNOW THAT THAT'S BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, IT STILL HURTS THAT WE WERE NOT CONSIDERED WORTHY OF BEING HAPPY FOR, THAT IT WAS STILL NOT A WORTHY LOVE. TO ME, LIKE, I HEAR YOU SAYING THAT, AND I'M NOT MARRIED, BUT I'M SURE THAT WOULD HURT MY FEELINGS. THAT IS THE SMALL TOWN, KIND OF, LIKE, EVERYBODY'S GONNA KNOW. EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE TALKING, SO, WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO TALK. THAT ALSO PUSHES US DOWN AND MAKES US FEEL LESS PROUD OF WHO WE ARE. I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU GUYS TO BE INVOLVED WITH ME ON PUTTING OUR DRAG SHOW TOGETHER. BY THE WAY, I'M A DRAG QUEEN. WHAT? YEAH, WHAT? WHAT? THAT'S AWESOME. YEAH. I WANT TO GIVE THEM KIND OF A WEDDING EXPERIENCE THAT THEY DID NOT GET TO HAVE THAT FIRST TIME AROUND. I WANT THEM TO FEEL LIKE THIS WAS THEIR SPECIAL DAY. THAT'S GONNA BE SO MUCH FUN. OH, YES, IT IS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING OVER. IT'S GONNA BE SUPER FUN, AND I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING SPECIAL, ALL OF US TOGETHER, FOR REAL. YEAH, OH, HOW ARE YOU? I'M GOOD, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THIS IS MY SISTER, BOB. HI, HOW ARE YOU? BOB, HI, SO NICE TO MEET YOU. GIVE ME A HUG. OH, WE'RE HUGGING. THIS IS FUN, WHAT IS THIS? JUST THROWING A PARTY. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? WHAT DO WE ALL DO? JUST SIT AROUND AND DRINK? CLIFTON'S WORLD IS VERY, LIKE, BACKWARDS, I THINK. THE PARTIES AROUND THE BONFIRE, VERY CAMOUFLAGE, LIKE, THEY GOT THE DIRTY BOOTS ON. HE INVITED ME TO THIS PARTY WITH HIS FAMILY, WHICH IS SUPER OPEN, YOU KNOW? IT CAN BE SCARY TO BRING SOMEONE DIFFERENT INTO YOUR CIRCLE OF FRIENDS. HI, EUREKA. IT'S A PLEASURE. WHAT'S UP, BOYS? GOOD TO MEET YOU. TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT TWIN FALLS, I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT Y'ALL. JUST THE DRINKING, YOU LIKE TO DRINK? YEAH, WE LIKE TO DRINK. SO, WE'RE DOING A BIG DRAG SHOW ON THE 21ST. I HAVE A DRAG DAUGHTER, AND IT'S CLIFTON, YOU KNOW THIS GUY? SO THIS GUY IS LETTING ME PUT HIM UP IN DRAG, Y'ALL. WE'RE GONNA SHAVE HIS BEARD OFF. YEAH, I KNOW, SO HE'S GONNA COME DOWN. ARE YOU GONNA COME WATCH HIM? WE'LL THINK ON THAT. YEAH, THINK ON IT. I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS. I COME FROM THAT TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT, AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE SITTING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM, LIKE, "WHAT IN THE GAY HELL IS GOING ON AT THIS PARTY?" YOU PLAY BEER PONG? WILL YOU HELP ME SET IT UP? I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT IT, BUT I WANNA BEAT BOB AT IT. THAT'S ALL I KNOW. IS THIS MY TURN? OH. BITCH, YOUR TURN. ARGH. Y'ALL DON'T KNOW HOW TO MESS WITH ME, MAMA, Y'ALL CAN'T MESS WITH ME ON THE BEER PONG. OH, MY GOD, THIS IS SO MUCH FUN. I NEVER WIN AT SPORTS. LET'S GO MEET YOUR FRIENDS. WHO'S THE COOLEST PEOPLE FIRST? I'M A HUGGER. I'M A HUGGER, TOO. WHAT'S UP? WE'RE HUGGERS AROUND HERE. LOOK, I LIKE THAT. OH, HI. I LOVE YOUR HAT. 'CAUSE WE'RE BIG AND TALL, OOH, THAT RIGHT. YEAH, DAMN RIGHT. OH, MY GOD, I FINALLY FOUND A HUSBAND WHEN I'M IN DRAG. THIS IS GONNA BE YOUR DRAG DADDY. I MEAN, HEY, I BEEN CALLED "DADDY" ONCE OR TWICE. OH. OH, MY GOD. HI, DADDY. I'M SO PETITE. REALLY, AT THE PARTY, I SAW A MUCH MORE CONSERVATIVE CLIFTON, AND I DON'T THINK THAT ALL OF HIS FRIENDS KNOW THAT HE'S GONNA BE DOING DRAG, SO I'M CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT. SO, I WANNA GO, IF YOU'RE INTO IT, I WANNA GO, LIKE, VERY ROCK STAR, LIKE, ROCKER CHICK, SHALL WE CALL IT THAT? ALL RIGHT. THIS IS SOME OF THE CLOTHES OPTIONS THAT WE'RE GOING WITH. BRAS, WE GOT HIP PADS, WE'RE GONNA PUT BODY ON YOU, BUT I ALSO REALLY WANNA DO, LIKE, A TUCK REVEAL MOMENT, DURING THE PERFORMANCE. LIKE YOU HAVE THE SKIRT, BUT IT'S GONNA BE, LIKE, A RIPAWAY. YOU'LL ACTUALLY BE IN THIS LEOTARD, SO, LIKE, YOU WILL WANNA MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A NICE, TIGHT, FLAT COOCHIE, AND WE WANNA SHOW THE WORLD YOUR COOCHIE. IT'S GONNA BE SEXY. OH, MAN, I LOOK REALLY NICE. YES, YOU DO. LET'S KEEP IT REAL, OKAY? I'M GONNA GIVE THEM AN EXTRAVAGANZA, YOU WOULD THINK THIS IS GONNA BE THE MACY'S DAY PARADE, ALL RIGHT? I'M BRINGING EVERYTHING. THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL COLOR ON YOU. SHAKE IT A LITTLE BIT, SHAKE IT, YES, YES. SHE'S GIVING ME ASHLEY O, MILEY CYRUS, "BLACK MIRROR" FISH. YES. ARE YOU GONNA -- YEAH, I THINK SO. HE'S A LITTLE RELUCTANT. WELL, I MEAN, HAIR GROWS BACK. DOES IT? DOES IT? YEAH, PUSH IT BACK FOR ME. PUSH BACK. YOU'RE DOING GOOD. ALL RIGHT, TURN AROUND, LET'S SEE IT. NOT BAD, YOU GOT A FAT PUSSY. OR PUSWATCHER. SHE'S GOT A FAT PUSWATCHER, BUT SHE'S GOT ONE. I THINK THEY CALL THAT A MEATY TUCK. THAT'S A SANDWICH. YOU CAN BE OPEN WITH ME IF YOU'RE NERVOUS, AND IF YOU'RE -- NO, I'M FINE. THIS IS, LIKE, OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE, 'CAUSE, NORMALLY, I DO, LIKE, BROADWAY SONGS AND STUFF, WHICH I CAN REALLY, LIKE, PLAY WITH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WELL, IT'S ALSO YOU BY YOURSELF. YEAH. RIGHT. THESE QUEENS NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND WORK AS A TEAM. I REALLY SEE, LIKE, YOU JUST THE FIERY, SEXY VIBE, IT WOULD BE, LIKE, A BIG BUBBLE, BASICALLY. I LOVE THIS IDEA OF EACH GIRL REPRESENTS A ELEMENT. ONCE IT'S STYLED, IT'S GONNA BE LIKE A BLOWOUT, RIGHT? BECAUSE IT'S JUST FLOWING. SHE LIVES FOR THE WIND. LIKE WHEN THE ELEMENTS COME TOGETHER, IT IS POWER. OH, MY GOD, I FEEL LIKE THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE. COME ON IN, GIRL. COME ON OVER HERE. SIT DOWN WITH ME. I WANT YOU TO KNOW, LIKE, THIS EXPERIENCE, FOR ME, IS JUST AS MUCH ABOUT YOU AS IT IS ABOUT BRANDON, TOO. FOR YOUR MOM AND YOUR DAD, YOU THINK YOUR MOM OR YOUR DAD ARE GONNA COME TO THE SHOW ON THURSDAY? NO. NO, DEFINITELY NOT. OKAY, DEFINITELY NOT. I'VE ACTUALLY ASKED THEM A COUPLE OF TIMES, BUT, YEAH -- WHAT WAS THEIR, KIND OF RESPONSE? MY MOM'S ACTUALLY REALLY UPSET I'M DOING DRAG. SHE WAS LIKE, "I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE THAT KIND OF GAY." DID SHE -- WELL, ME, TOO. I GUESS I'M THAT KIND OF GAY, TOO, GIRL. WHAT DO YOU THINK HER PERCEPTION OF DRAG IS? I THINK SHE THINKS THAT A LOT OF, NOT JUST DRAG QUEENS, BUT THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY ARE SEXUALLY PROMISCUOUS INDIVIDUALS. SHE THINK WE HOES. YEAH. WELL, TRUTH BE TOLD, THERE ARE SOME HOES IN DRAG. BUT NOT EVERYONE. YEAH, AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG THAT, ANYWAY. YEAH, OKAY, GIRL, BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT, I UNDERSTAND. SHE'S SO EMBEDDED IN THAT STEREOTYPE. SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT I MAY BE PORTRAYING THAT I AM A HO, BASICALLY. RIGHT, YEAH, I HEAR YOU. I TOTALLY GET WHAT MAMA MAY BE FEELING, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S A SPECTRUM, YOU KNOW? THERE'S ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF DRAG, AND IT'S WHAT YOU WANNA CONVEY IN THAT MOMENT, AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO, TOGETHER, YOU, ME, AND BRANDON, IS WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING POWERFUL. HOPEFULLY, IF SHE DOES GET TO SEE THIS, IF YOUR DAD WERE TO SEE THIS, IT WOULD BE LIKE, "OKAY, WELL, THAT'S NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE." YEAH. YEAH? I THINK, BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD, AND KNOWING THE MOTIVATIONS MY PARENTS HAD TO RAISE ME THE WAY THAT I WAS, THEY DID, I KNOW IT SOUNDS SILLY, BUT THEY DID IT OUT OF LOVE, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT I COULD GET BACK TO HEAVEN WITH THEM AND LIVE WITH THEM FOREVER. YOU KNOW, THESE PEOPLE AREN'T EVIL PEOPLE. RIGHT. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DEMONIZE THEM, TOO. THE ONLY WAY TO SPREAD LOVE IS TO TRULY JUST GIVE LOVE. AND MAYBE IF THEY SEE HOW HAPPY YOU ARE, OVER TIME, IT MAY MAKE THEM RETHINK, AND GUESS WHAT, IT MIGHT NOT. BUT YOU GOTTA THINK ABOUT WHO YOU ARE TODAY, HONEY, YOU CAN'T LIVE FOR NOBODY BUT YOURSELF, OKAY? GIVE ME A HUG. TWIN FALLS IS SUCH A STRANGE PLACE. IT'S A MIXTURE OF FEMMEPHOBIA, FATPHOBIA, HOMOPHOBIA, WHATEVER HAVE YOU, THE FACTORY WORKERS LIKE ME GO TO WORK AND THEN GO HOME. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY FEMININE. I'M BIG, I'M TALL, I'M INTIMIDATING. EVERYTHING ABOUT ME, AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER, HAS BEEN USED AGAINST ME. THE VOICE IN MY HEAD THAT TELLS ME THAT I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND THAT I NEVER WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH, THAT'S MY MOTHER'S VOICE. I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN INTERESTED IN PUTTING A LABEL, I JUST SAY, "NOT STRAIGHT." IT JUST FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE, NOT HAVING TO PUT A LABEL ON IT, FOR ME. ESPECIALLY HERE IN TWIN FALLS, LIKE, BISEXUAL, THEY'RE, LIKE, "OH, IT DOESN'T EXIST," BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL GETTING USED TO LIKE, GAY. I DON'T REALLY GO OUT ACTIVELY TO HANG OUT WITH LGBT INDIVIDUALS. I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF THE LGBT MEMBERS HERE IN TWIN KIND OF NEED THAT, THEY KIND OF NEED THOSE PEOPLE TO LET THEM KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT IT'S OKAY, AND THAT THEY BELONG, AND THAT THEY CAN HAVE FRIENDS, AND THEY CAN MAKE THEIR OWN FAMILY. I DON'T NEED THAT. I FEEL A SENSE OF SELF DOUBT AND DEPRESSION, SOMETIMES EVEN SUICIDAL THOUGHTS RUN THROUGH MY HEAD. I THINK WE ALL GO THROUGH THAT, THOUGH, BEING DIFFERENT, UNIQUE PERSON THAT YOU ARE. WE ALL GO THROUGH THAT STRUGGLE OF LIFE. THERE'S ALWAYS, KIND OF, A LONELY SENSE OF BEING IN ME. IT'S HARD, SOME DAYS, TO KNOW YOU'RE LOVED. I JUST, PERSONALLY, STRUGGLE WITH HAVING THAT HELP. HOW LONG IS THE RIDE? WE'RE ABOUT 35 MINUTES AWAY. SO, WHO DO YOU LIVE WITH? I LIVE WITH MY GRANDFATHER, LARRY. MY GRANDPA'S JUST MY BIGGEST SUPPORTER, REALLY, LIKE, IN DRAG AND OUT OF DRAG. HE'S VERY LOVING AND CARING TO EVERYONE. HE DOESN'T CARE WHO YOU ARE. HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED TOGETHER? FOR, ON AND OFF, SINCE I WAS 17. OH, WORK. I'VE MOVED A COUPLE OF TIMES, BUT, THEN CAME BACK TO HELP GRANDPA. OH, THAT'S SWEET. SO, THIS IS HOME, AND THIS IS MY GRANDPA. OH, HI. NICE TO MEET YOU. JUST CALL ME "GRANDPA." GRANDPA. NICE TO MEET YOU, GRANDPA. HAVE A SEAT. SO, GRANDPA, DO YOU EVER COME TO ANY OF THE SHOWS? YES. AND THEN, HE ALSO WENT TO THE PRIDE FESTIVAL FOR THE FIRST TIME. YEAH. OH, HOW WAS THAT? IT WAS GOOD, I LIKED IT. SO, YOU GET READY HERE? YEAH, I GET READY HERE. I COME OUT FROM THERE, AND WALK AROUND, AND JUST ASK HIM IF I LOOK ALL RIGHT, AND IF IT'S GONNA LOOK GOOD ON STAGE AND STUFF. I LOVE THAT. SO, YOU'RE, LIKE, THE FINAL PASS IS, YOU'RE, LIKE, GOOD OR NO GOOD. ESPECIALLY WITH ON HIS WIGS. WELL, GRANDPA, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF SOME OF THESE SCANDALOUS OUTFITS? THAT'S HIM. THAT'S HIS THING, AND HE CAN DO IT. GRANDPA, WE ARE GOING TO, LIKE, TAKE LUCID DREAMS, AND SHE'S GONNA BE THE ULTIMATE DREAM. DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT OUT TO SEE? OH, YOU CAN'T KEEP ME AWAY FROM THAT. WHATEVER HE WANTS TO DO, I'M ALL FOR IT. THAT'S AMAZING. IF I DIDN'T HAVE THAT SUPPORT, I WOULD BE IN A VERY DARK PLACE WITH MY LIFE. AND I DON'T EVEN THINK I WOULD BE DOING WHAT I'M DOING WITH THE WHOLE DRAG THING, EITHER. MY CHILDHOOD, IT WASN'T THE GREATEST, LIKE, MY MOM LEFT ME WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD. FOR MY DAD, PERSONALLY, IT WAS A STRUGGLE COMING OUT WITH HIM. THANKFULLY, MY GRANDPA AND MY CONNECTION'S JUST UNIQUE AND LOVING, AND WE'RE JUST A PART OF ONE ANOTHER. WHAT MADE YOU MOVE HERE WITH LARRY? JUST 'CAUSE GRANDPA'S NEEDED HELP, LIKE, HE WAS GOING THROUGH PROSTATE CANCER. AND THEN, LAST YEAR, I HAD A HEART ATTACK. OH, MY GOODNESS. IT'S OKAY, GRANDPA. IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY. I'M GONNA COME OVER TO YOU. THAT'S A LOT TO GO THROUGH. BUT I'D HAVE BEEN LOST WITHOUT MIKE. OH, I DON'T HAVE ANY GRANDPARENTS. ALL MY GRANDPARENTS HAVE PASSED AWAY. WELL, YOU HAVE ONE NOW. THAT'S WHY EVERYBODY CALLS ME "GRANDPA." I INSIST ON IT. SO IT IS NICE TO SEE LIKE, LUCID AND LARRY IN THESE MOMENTS TOGETHER. AND SPENDING THIS TIME TOGETHER, BECAUSE, JUST, NOT EVERYONE HAS THAT. EVERYONE DOESN'T HAVE THAT. BUT I THINK LUCID IS LONELY. LIKE, LUCID WANTS FRIENDS. WE CRAVE HUMAN INTERACTION, AND NOT JUST FROM WORK AND FAMILY, BUT FROM YOUR PEERS AND FROM PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. SO, I THINK THAT MAYBE LUCID CAN WORK MORE ON CONNECTING TO HER CASTMATES. MORE THAN ANYTHING, THIS IS A REALLY FIERCE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A REALLY BIG, STRONG QUEER PRESENCE IN THIS COMMUNITY. LIKE, WE'RE ACTING LIKE IT'S FUCKING PRIDE. FOR THE OPENING, I WANT YOU TO REALLY, LIKE, FEMINIZE IT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN, 'CAUSE I WANT PEOPLE TO LIKE, NOTICEABLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS MANLY MAN THAT THEY KNOW AND THE GORGEOUS WOMAN THAT'S ABOUT TO WALK OUT. ALL RIGHT. WE TALKED ABOUT THE WEDDING DAY, WE TALKED ABOUT THAT YOU GUYS WISHED THAT IT COULD BE A LITTLE MORE. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU MORE. OKAY. IT WILL BE A REFLECTION OF WHAT LOVE LOOKS LIKE, LOVE BEYOND BOUNDARIES, OKAY? BUT IT WON'T LOOK LIKE THAT IF WE FUCK IT UP. OKAY? GIVE A LITTLE BOUNCE. NOW, GIVE A LITTLE TWIST TO THE ARM, JUST ONE. A LIGHT TWIST. A LIGHT TWIST? LIKE THIS. JUST ONE ARM? JUST SO YOU GUYS CAN GET THE WORDS, EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW THEM EXACTLY, SAY THEM OUT LOUD. JUST LIKE IN "GYPSY," "SING OUT, LOUISE." HAVE YOU EVER SEEN "GYPSY?" WHAT KIND OF QUEER PEOPLE ARE YOU? WE'RE GONNA WORK ON INDIVIDUAL STUFF, BUT I NEED YOU TO VARY UP YOUR MOVES. I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF ANYTHING YET. I'M STILL, LIKE, THINKING OF MOVES. IT'S, OKAY, I'M JUST SAYING. HOLD THE MARSHMALLOW, THIS FEMINIZES A MANLY HAND. OKAY. AND YOU LEAD WITH THAT MIDDLE FINGER. SURE, I GOT IT. YEAH, THERE YOU GO, BUT DON'T GET TOO WITCHY. WE DON'T WANT YOU TO LOOK LIKE YOU'RE CASTING SPELLS. YOU SEEM TO ALREADY KNOW ALL THE WORDS, WHICH IS AMAZING. I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO IT NONSTOP SINCE I GOT IT. THANK YOU. OH, MY GOD. I MEMORIZED THE FIRST LYRICS, AND THEN, THAT WAS IT. NOW, I AM GONNA BE OPEN AND HONEST WITH YOU ALL, I AM A NERVOUS IF YOU TWO ARE GONNA LEARN THESE LYRICS. OH, YEAH, I KNOW. I STARTED LISTENING TO 'EM 'CAUSE I GOT 'EM LAST NIGHT. WORK, ALL RIGHT. SO, I'VE BEEN LIKE -- THAT'S THE SAME WITH ME. I JUST BARELY GOT 'EM YESTERDAY, SO -- SO DID I. OH, I KNOW HE KNOWS ALL THE WORDS. THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION, WE'RE NOT COMPETING. YOU GUYS ARE JUST YOUNG, IT'S FINE. BUT I WILL SAY THIS. I'M AS OLD AS YOU, BITCH. IF A GIRL DOES NOT KNOW HER LYRICS, THE AUDIENCE IS, LIKE, HMMM, HMMM. BRANDON, YOU'RE, LIKE, STRONG, SO COMMAND THE STAGE WHEN YOU'RE MOVING. WHEN I WATCH DRAG KINGS PERFORM, THEY'RE, LIKE, YO. I'M IN YOUR FACE, I GOT THE ATTENTION HERE. GIVE IT TO THEM. IT'S ME, BRANDON, ROAR. ROAR. ROAR. YEAH, THERE YOU GO. THAT'S WHAT I NEED YOU TO TAKE THAT RIGHT ONTO THE STAGE. IF YOU FEEL SASSY, AND YOU WANNA BOUNCE, BOUNCE. JUST DON'T DO IT WITH, LIKE, CLIFTON BOUNCE, YOU KNOW? THIS, IT'S YOUR, LIKE, HOE DOWN BOUNCE. I'M NOT JUDGING, BUT YOU DID NOT LOOK VERY FEMININE. ALL RIGHT. YOU DO THIS WHOLE PART, THEN, WHEN YOU GO HERE, YOU DO, HOW'S YOURS START? I DON'T REMEMBER. AND REMEMBER TO LEAD WITH THOSE MIDDLE FINGERS. OH, WHO IS SHE? YOU'RE GETTING THERE. IT'S A BRIDE'S DAY. AND I WANT YOU GUYS TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GETTING THE SPECIAL DAY THAT YOU DESERVE. THAT'S ALL I EVER WANTED FOR OUR WEDDING, WAS EVERYBODY THAT WAS THERE TO LOVE US AND LOVE THAT WE WERE GETTING MARRIED, AND SO IT'S -- IT'S REALLY AWESOME. THIS IS A MOMENT FOR Y'ALL, AND I KNOW THAT, ON THE DAY, THAT YOUR DAD DIDN'T GET TO WALK YOU DOWN THE AISLE AND, I MEAN, I KNOW THEY PROBABLY WON'T CHANGE THEIR MIND ABOUT COMING, BUT, IF NOT, I WILL WALK YOU DOWN THE AISLE. ALL RIGHT? OUR DEAR HEAVENLY FATHER, WE THANK THEE FOR THIS DAY. WE THANK YOU THAT WE CAN ALL BE HERE TOGETHER. WHEN I MEET BRANDON'S FAMILY, IT'S ALMOST, LIKE, GOING HOME TO MY FAMILY. THERE'S AN INTERESTING ENERGY IN THE HOUSE, RIGHT? IT'S, LIKE, EVERYTHING'S GREAT HERE, BUT NOTHING'S PERFECT IN ANY OF OUR HOUSES. I DON'T SEE A HUGE AMOUNT OF DIVERSITY IN THIS CITY. GROWING UP, COMING OUT AS A QUEER PERSON IN A SMALL COMMUNITY, THAT CAN MAKE, LIKE, SCHOOL, WHETHER IT'S ELEMENTARY, OR MIDDLE SCHOOL, OR HIGH SCHOOL, LIKE, SUPER DIFFICULT. LIKE, WHAT WAS YOUR HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE LIKE? MY HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE WAS AWESOME. IT WASN'T UNTIL I WENT TO COLLEGE THAT I FINALLY HAD TO FACE THAT HOLE THAT I HAD, AND I WAS LIKE, "WOW, THERE'S THAT THING THAT I FELT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, IT'S BACK," BUT THE THING IS, IT NEVER LEFT. SO -- YOU WERE JUST PREOCCUPYING YOURSELF WITH OTHER THINGS SO IT DIDN'T FEEL. MOM, DID YOU EVER GET, LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHEN BRANDON WENT AWAY FOR COLLEGE, DID YOU EVER TALK TO HIM ON THE PHONE, AND YOU COULD LIKE, FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON? BOTH OF US KNEW THAT THERE, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A STRUGGLE THERE, BUT WE WERE ALSO CONFIDENT THAT HE WOULD BE OKAY. WHEN I CAME OUT, MY FAMILY DIDN'T REACT VERY WELL. THERE WAS A LOT OF HURT THINGS THAT WERE SAID. I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING DIFFERENT, A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE SIDE OF LOVE, AND MY FAMILY REACTED IN FEAR. TO BE HONEST, IT WASN'T EASY, LIKE, FINDING OUT, I GUESS, ABOUT EVERYTHING, IT WASN'T EASY, AND, I MEAN, IT STILL TAKES TIME. IT'S HARD BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE WAY WE GREW UP IS VERY SET IN STONE, LIKE, BLACK AND WHITE, AND SO, I DON'T AGREE WITH YOUR CHOICES OR WHATEVER YOU WANNA SAY, BUT, I DO ACCEPT THAT YOU ARE DOING WHAT YOU GUYS KNOW TO MAKE YOURSELVES HAPPY, YOU KNOW? THIS FAMILY IS STRUGGLING WITH THEIR OWN BELIEFS, THEIR OWN VALUE SYSTEM, HOW THEY WERE RAISED, AND NOW, BEING CONFRONTED WITH THIS ISSUE AND HAVING TO CHANGE, BUT, GUESS WHAT, YOU'VE GOTTA CHANGE. WILL WE SEE BRANDON'S FAMILY AT THE SHOW? I DON'T KNOW. IT WOULD BE AMAZING FOR THEM TO BE THERE BECAUSE IT WOULD SHOW THAT THEY WERE TRYING, THAT THEY'RE MAKING SOME TYPE OF AN EFFORT. I THINK THAT WOULD MEAN THE MOON, THE WORLD, AND THE STARS. I DON'T KNOW WHO'S COMING, BUT I KNOW ONE THING, I KNOW I'M GONNA BE THERE, AND MORE OF THE COMMUNITY WILL ALSO COME, SO THAT EVEN IF THEIR FAMILIES AREN'T THERE, THEY KNOW THAT SOMEBODY IS STANDING IN THEIR CORNER. LET'S BE HONEST, HOW GOOD DOES IT FEEL WHEN YOUR MAMA SHOWS UP FOR YOU? IT'S GAME DAY. IT'S GAME DAY. IT'S GAME DAY. HELLO, GLITTER BEARD. KEEP TURNING, KEEP TURNING. GOOD TO GO? I WANT BRANDON AND MIKAYLA TO WALK AWAY FROM THIS PERFORMANCE FEELING MORE CONFIDENT IN WHO THEY ARE. CAN WE ADD MORE? THE SMALLER GLITTER NOW, OKAY? LET ME TELL YOU, WHENEVER PEOPLE INSINUATE THAT I DON'T LOOK GOOD, I'M, LIKE, "YOU ARE INSANE. THIS BITCH STUNS." IT WOULD PROBABLY MEAN A LOT FOR A YOUNG QUEER PERSON TO SEE A SHOW. LIKE, I'M KIND OF LIKE, NERVOUS, A LITTLE BIT. FAILURE'S NOT AN OPTION. ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT THE BEARD COMING OFF? READY? YEAH, GO FOR IT. HE'S GONNA DIE, MAMA'S RIGHT HERE. OH, MY GOD, OKAY. TURN YOUR HEAD IN THE MIRROR. OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THE MIRROR. OH, MY GOD, WHO ARE YOU? AND THEN, WHOA. DRAG IS LITERALLY ABOUT GOING FROM WHO YOU ARE TO WHAT YOU CAN BE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. MAGIC VALLEY, TWIN FALLS, ARE YOU READY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME? PLEASE WELCOME MISS BOB THE DRAG QUEEN. OH, MY GOODNESS, DO Y'ALL LIKE MY OUTFIT? THANK YOU, A LOCAL MISS BARBARA MADE THIS SKIRT FOR ME. CAN WE PLEASE GIVE IT UP FOR BARBARA? YES. YES, HONEY. SO, WE SHOWED UP IN TOWN ABOUT A WEEK AGO. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. I GOOGLED HOW MANY BLACK PEOPLE WERE IN TWIN FALLS, AND THEY SAID, "YOU." BUT THERE IS A FULL-ON BLACK COMMUNITY HERE, A QUEER COMMUNITY HERE, A TRANS COMMUNITY HERE. THERE ARE ALLIES HERE. THOUGH WE MAY BE FEW, WE ARE PROUD, AND WE'RE HAPPY TO BE HERE, OKAY? SO, ARE WE ALL READY FOR AN AMAZING SHOW? GROWING UP, AS FAR AS THE GAY COMMUNITY WAS CONCERNED, IT WAS ALWAYS A BAD THING. GIVE ME YOUR HANDS. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, WE'RE GONNA FUCKING ROCK IT. YEAH, WE ARE. WE'RE READY. OKAY, LET'S GO. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IF MY YOUNGER SELF -- COULD SEE ME NOW. HOW DO YOU FEEL BEING IN DRAG? SEXY AS FUCK. TWIN FALLS, ARE YOU READY FOR SOME MORE DRAG? PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FOR EUREKA O'HARA AND CLEO-PAT-YOUR-ASS. NOW GIVE IT UP FOR THE SEXIST MOTHERFUCKER IN TWIN FALLS, CLEO-PAT-YOUR-ASS. NOW CLEO, I GOT A QUESTION, WHAT WAS THIS EXPERIENCE LIKE FOR YOU? HOLY SHENANIGANS, THIS HAS BEEN FREAKIN' AWESOME. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS A HETERONORMATIVE MAN, LIVING RIGHT HERE, WHO SAID, "YOU KNOW? FUCK IT. I'M AN ALLY, AND I'M GONNA TAKE A WALK IN YOUR MOTHERFUCKING SHOES TONIGHT." BEING AN OUTCAST, TO ME, IS, LIKE, SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T FIT INTO THE FORM OF WHAT SOCIETY WANTS YOU TO BE. THIS IS NORMAL. THIS IS HOW YOUR DAD DRESSES. THIS IS HOW GRANDPA DRESSES. SAME AS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN, RIGHT, DON'T STRAY. YOU WANNA CALL ME A WOMAN, YOU WANNA CALL ME A MAN, YOU WANNA CALL ME A FAGGOT, I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO BE THE LIFE OF THE PARTY, WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR APPROVAL. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, YOU REALLY DO. THANK YOU. BELIEVE IT. BECAUSE YOU DO LOOK BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. I WOULD NOT LIE TO YOU. AH, SHENANIGANS. WE'RE ALL WORKING ON EACH OTHER AND TRYING TO BUILD ONE ANOTHER. PLEASE, GIVE IT UP FOR THE LOVELY MISS LAVENDER BEAUCHAMP. LUCID DREAMS, AMELIA BLAYKE, AND BOB THE DRAG QUEEN. HELLO, TWIN FALLS! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT TO THIS ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME SHOW, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PRODUCTION, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE DRAG ASPECT OF ALL OF THIS, AND, ALSO, LET'S HAVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR OUR LOCAL DRAG.

OKAY, WE GOT MIKAYLA GOING TO MARK RIGHT NOW. WE ARE READY TO GO. PLEASE WELCOME, OUR NEW DRAG QUEEN FORTISSIMA, AND HER DRAG KING HUSBAND, CHRIS SINDELL, PRESENTED BY SHANGELA.

THIS GIVES ME A LOT OF HOPE, SO, THANK YOU, GUYS. REALLY, THANK YOU. THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE ROOTING FOR US. OH, MY GOD, THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

UNTIL YOU EXPERIENCE SOMETHING, YOU CAN'T REALLY SAY YOU KNOW 100% THIS IS WHO YOU ARE. SEEING SOMEBODY LIKE CLIFTON, YOU KNOW, A HETERONORMATIVE MALE, WILLING TO OPEN UP TO A COMMUNITY AND SHOW HIS FEMININE SIDE, IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IT'S GONNA MAKE OTHER GUYS FEEL LIKE THEY CAN DO IT, TOO. I DO. I REALLY DO, THOUGH. I LOVE YOU, GOD BLESS. WE WANT TO LEAVE THEM WITH A THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE. NOW, WE STARTED SOMETHING, AND WHEN WE ROLL OUT, WE ARE LEAVING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS COMMUNITY, WHO WE PARTNERED WITH, TO GIVE THE ANSWERS. WE WANT THEM TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO GO OUT AND SPEAK ABOUT, THIS IS WHO I AM, AND YES, I'M A PART OF THIS COMMUNITY. HONEY, IT IS BACK TO NORMAL. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE HERE. IT'S BACK TO NORMAL. OH, ALL OF US. NO ONE IN THE STREET. WHERE DID ALL THOSE PEOPLE GO? REAL TEAM. GIRL, GET ME A CAR, YOU KNOW, MY FEET HURT IN THESE HEELS. YOU KNOW, MY FEET HURT IN THESE HEELS, BITCH.

Let me smell it. Waft it. Hey, Branson, hey! That's right, honey. The wholesome, Christian, Las Vegas of the Midwest. We're looking to do like a drag show here. Not this place. Good lord. Why is it a sin for a guy to be with a guy? My grandpa taught me you have to bottle up your emotions. It's hard to have to suppress who you are. It's not right. The thing about drag, it's like you can conquer the world. It makes you want to start changing things in your life, so that you can feel that way again. Sickening.
