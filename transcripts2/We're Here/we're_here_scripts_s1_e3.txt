 OH, BUT THAT IS NOT YOUR SHOE. THAT'S MY SHOE. THIS IS MOVING TOO... MY SHOE. COME ON, BOB. I'M THE ONE WITH THESE LAZY BITCHES. IT'S FINE WHEN I TRAVEL WITH THE LAZY MOTHERFUCKERS. IS THERE A CONCIERGE? HEY, BRANSON, HEY. WE ARE IN BRANSON, MISSOURI. THAT'S RIGHT, HONEY, THE WHOLESOME CHRISTIAN LAS VEGAS OF THE MIDWEST. YOU'RE A GUY. WHAT'S YOUR NAME, BABY? WHO, ME? YEAH. MAYBE YOU'RE A GUY? MAYBE WE'RE ALL GUYS. YOU CAUGHT HIM. YOU CAUGHT HIM. OH, NO, I'M NOT A GUY. YOU'RE A GIRL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BUT NO. YOU'RE NOT EITHER? NO, NO, NO, NO. THIS IS A COSTUME. OBVIOUSLY A WOMAN. NOW I'M CLEARLY A WOMAN. THIS JUST LIKE, RANDOM AREA IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, WHERE YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE ATTRACTIONS. CHRISTIAN BANDS AND CHRISTIAN CHORUS LINES, WHOLESOME FAMILY FRIENDLY SHOWS. HELLO, HOW ARE YOU ALL DOING? HELLO, HI. HELLO. OH, SO WE'RE DOING A DRAG SHOW AND WE'VE ACTUALLY GOTTEN SOME LOCALS HERE TO DO THE DRAG SHOW WITH US. AND WE NEED YOU ALL TO COME AND SUPPORT. I THINK IT'D BE GREAT THOUGH. HI. HE'S LIKE, "WHAT IN THE WORLD?" WE LOOK ALMOST LIKE A -- BOB, YOU MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY TO SIT UP HERE AND HAVE SOCKS IN YOUR CHEST. SOCKS ARE THE BEST TITTIES. I SAID IT. HELLO, SIR, HOW ARE YOU? YOU GUYS HAVE TO MOVE FROM THE PREMISES. THE COPS HAVE BEEN CALLED. OH, WORK. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ABOUT TO MOVE. WAIT, THEY CALLED THE POLICE? ON WHO? YOU GUYS HAVE TO MOVE FROM THE PREMISES. GROWING UP, IT WASN'T TILL LATER THAT I REALIZED THAT BRANSON WAS, LIKE, A ONE-OF-A-KIND THING. YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE SHOWS. MY EARLIEST MEMORIES OF LIKE, GETTING INTO MUSICAL THEATER WAS ACTUALLY MY MOTHER. SHE WOULD LISTEN TO THE CAST RECORDING OF "WICKED" AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH THAT STINKING SHOW. AND EVER SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PURSUE THAT. I STRUGGLED WITH SAME SEX ATTRACTION THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE LIFE. SO I CAME OUT MY JUNIOR OF HIGH SCHOOL AND MY FAMILY WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE AND I HAD A VERY EASY COMING OUT. BUT NOW I ULTIMATELY IDENTIFY AS A CHRISTIAN, I DON'T IDENTIFY AS QUEER. TO SOMEONE LIKE MY MOTHER WHO ISN'T NECESSARILY WHAT YOU WOULD CALL A BELIEVER, IT'S REALLY HARD FOR HER. I KNOW THAT SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT GOD'S WORD SAYS. BUT I KNOW GOD'S GOT IT. OH, MY GOSH, IT'S SUCH AN HONOR. OH, IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. YOU DID A REALLY GOOD JOB. THANK YOU. OH, MY GOSH. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN BACK IN BRANSON? ABOUT, PROBABLY ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF NOW. LIKE, WHEN I LIVED UP IN SPRINGFIELD, I WAS LIVING THIS EXTREMELY LIKE, ALL OVER THE PLACE LIFE. I WAS PART OF THE HOMOSEXUAL COMMUNITY AND MY DRUG HABITS AND MY ALCOHOL HABITS WERE REALLY GETTING OUT OF CONTROL, TO THE POINT THAT IT WAS DESTROYING MY LIFE. IT FINALLY CLICKED ONE DAY THAT IT WAS REALLY HURTING PEOPLE, SO I DECIDED LIKE, TO QUIT COLD TURKEY AND I PRAYED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SO LONG. AND I JUST FELT THIS KIND OF EASE OFF ME AND I FELT LIKE, OKAY, EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE GOOD. THEN I HAD TO COME TO CALMS WITH BEING GAY AND FOLLOWING CHRIST AND I ULTIMATELY, I HAD TO GO THE BIBLE ROUTE. WHEN YOU WERE IN SPRINGFIELD, DID YOU IDENTIFY AS A QUEER? YES. BUT YOU DON'T ANYMORE? NO. AND HOW'S THAT BEEN? IS THAT LIKE A DAILY STRUGGLE? IT'S SOMETHING I STRUGGLE WITH ON A DAILY BASIS AND TO BE BLUNT, IT'S SOMETIMES I QUESTION LIKE, WHY IS IT A SIN FOR A GUY TO BE WITH A GUY? IT BOGGLES ME AT TIMES BUT IN THE SAME REGARD, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT FAITH IS ABOUT, YOU KNOW. IT ALL GOES BACK TO MY JOB IS TO SPEAK THE TRUTH, SPEAK WHAT, YOU KNOW, GOD HAS SHOWN ME TO BE THE TRUTH AND THEN LOVE. DO YOU TALK TO YOUR MOM ABOUT THIS LOT? IT'S VERY SPARINGLY THAT WE DO AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I'VE JUST LEARNED THAT YOU KNOW, NOT EVERYONE'S GONNA UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW. I WENT THE RELIGIOUS PHASE OF MY LIFE AND I DID FEEL LIKE THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME. SO I OFTEN HAVE VISCERAL RESPONSES TO CHRISTIANITY. BUT THEN I CAN ALSO LOOK BACK AT HOW IT HAS HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY LIFE, IN MY FAMILY. AND IF THIS IS WHAT HE NEEDS TO GET TO A POSITIVE SPACE, A SPACE WHERE HE CAN LIVE WITH HIMSELF AND BE HAPPY WITH HIMSELF, THEN HE HAS TO DO IT. I'M JUST TRYING TO CONSIDER HIS POINT OF VIEW. I'M EXCITED ABOUT DOING THIS PERFORMANCE WITH YOU AND YOUR MOM. I HAVE A COUPLE OF IDEAS THAT I'VE BEEN LIKE, WHISHING AROUND IN MY HEAD. I ALSO WANT TO PRESENT THEM TO YOU AND YOUR MOM TOMORROW, SO WE CAN LIKE, SIT DOWN AND LIKE, REALLY LIKE, CREATE THIS NUMBER TOGETHER. MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE BOTH, NOT ONLY EXCITED TO BE A PART OF, BUT THAT YOU CAN LOOK BACK WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE AND GO, "THAT WAS FUN, AND IT WAS REPRESENTATIVE OF WHO I AM." YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? MM-HM. I'M DOWN. THIS IS SO EXCITING. I KNOW, IT'S STILL LIKE, SETTING IN THAT I'M LIKE, SITTING WITH YOU AT -- CRAZY. ME OF ALL PEOPLE, IF YOU CAN EVEN BELIEVE IT. OKAY, ALL RIGHT. AH, HELLO? HOW ARE YOU? I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOUR REHEARSAL, YOU KNOW, I HATE TO INTERRUPT THE MAGIC. I SAW YOU WERE DOING LITTLE NUMBERS HERE AND I GOT EXCITED IN THE DOORWAY, BITCH, I WAS LIKE... ARE YOU A BALLET DANCER? THAT'S WHAT I WENT TO COLLEGE FOR, YEAH. KIND OF WENT A LITTLE BIT MORE MUSICAL THEATER AND JAZZ AND STUFF LIKE THAT. BUT... OH, VERY COOL. YOU KNOW, I SEE DANCE, I GET EXCITED BY IT. YES. NOW HERE'S THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION. OKAY. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT DRAG? I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DRAG. OH, GIVE ME WHAT YOU KNOW. OH, HERE WE GO. GOT A PROFESSIONAL, Y'ALL. Y'ALL, WE GOT A PROFESSIONAL. I THINK EVERYONE HAS A LITTLE BIT OF A QUEEN IN THEM. HALLELUJAH. RIGHT, SO I LOVE MAKEUP, YOU KNOW, I LOVE FLASHY THINGS. SO DRAG KIND OF IS A NATURAL THING FOR ME. I LOVE PERFORMING. I'M A DANCER. IT'S WHAT I DO. WHAT'S THE QUEER COMMUNITY LIKE HERE? IS THERE A QUEER COMMUNITY? YEAH, THERE IS, IT'S DEFINITELY LIKE BUBBLING UNDER THE SURFACE, JUST BEING, YOU KNOW, HAVING SO MANY SHOWS IN TOWN, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO HAVE A QUEER PRESENCE. WE ARE HERE, I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE A COMPLETELY OPEN SPACE YET. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WHY? WE'RE RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE BIBLE BELT, FIRST OF ALL. YOU KNOW. I'M A CHRISTIAN, BUT CERTAIN CHRISTIANS JUST THINK THAT IT'S WRONG. I LIVE WITH MY PARTNER, BRENT, WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER 11 YEARS. BRANSON PEOPLE, THEY SHOW THAT THEY'RE NOT FULLY ACCEPTING OF IT IN THEIR BODY LANGUAGE, OR YOU KNOW, THEIR GLANCES OVER AT US. CERTAIN THEATERS IN TOWN WILL NOT HIRE GAY PEOPLE, IF THEY FIND OUT YOU'RE GAY, I THINK YOU WOULD BE LET GO. WOW. YEAH, THEY JUST, THERE ARE RELIGIOUS SHOWS THAT HAVE CERTAIN CORE BELIEFS AND IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW YOUR BELIEFS, THEN YOU'RE NOT A PART OF THEIR CAST. WOW. SO I THINK THAT PROBABLY A LOT OF THOSE CAST MEMBERS ARE HIDING. HERE'S WHAT I WANT FOR THOSE WHO ARE HERE IN THIS COMMUNITY, YOU HAD TO STEP EVEN MORE FORWARD, FARTHER THAN WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW EVEN AND THAT WILL INSPIRE THE PEOPLE 'CAUSE THEY KNOW YOU OWN SO MUCH OF WHO YOU ARE ALREADY, BUT WHO ALSO YOU CAN BE. SURE. SO ARE WE GONNA DO A SHOW TOGETHER. YEAH. AND WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN WITH IT. COOL. AND MAYBE THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IN THIS COMMUNITY AND EVEN IF THERE AIN'T NOBODY, AT LEAST THERE'LL BE THE TWO OF US. RIGHT, WE'LL HAVE FUN. EXACTLY. IT'S HARD TO HAVE TO SUPPRESS WHO YOU ARE TO DO YOUR JOB. THAT'S NOT FAIR. IT'S NOT RIGHT, WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOMEONE RIGHT IN THEIR COMMUNITY WHO IS LIKE, "LOOK, HERE I AM, I'M GAY. I'M PROUD. I'M LIVING MY BEST LIFE. AND YOU CAN TOO." SPEAKING OF PERFORMING, LET'S GO AND GET US FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, TOGETHER BEFORE I HAVE TO HIT IT. OH. DON'T POP A SEAM, GIRL. GIRL, GOOD LUCK, THIS SHAPE GETS TIED UP IN THE JEANS GIRL, LOOK AT THAT, GIRL. I LOOK LIKE A KARDASHIAN IN THIS MIRROR, BITCH. YES, GIRL, ARE YOU PADDED? OOH. BITCH I'M FEELING THINGS I AIN'T FELT SINCE '86. YOU PROBABLY FEEL. WELL, HOW FAR DOWN ARE YOU GOING? I MEAN, YOU CAN GO LIKE, ALL THE WAY DOWN IF YOU WANT. WELL, YOU CAN. IF I GO DOWN, GIRL, THEN YOU KNOW, I DO THE DEATH DROP. OH YES. TWO MINUTES LIKE THIS, GOD, THAT I CAN DO. OOH THAT'S LOVELY. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TEACH ME THAT. AS A CHILD, MY MODEL AS A CHILD, MY MODEL FOR MASCULINITY WAS MY GRANDPA. THAT WAS REALLY IT. THAT WAS THE ONLY MALE MODEL I REALLY HAD. HE TAUGHT ME YOU HAVE TO BOTTLE UP YOUR EMOTIONS. THAT IT WASN'T OKAY TO CRY. IT FELT LIKE I WAS GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF LIFE AND NOT KNOWING HOW TO PROCESS ANYTHING. OUR DAUGHTER'S REALLY SICK. SHE IS GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME FOR HER WHOLE LIFE. AND THERE WAS A LOT OF TIMES WHERE I WASN'T THERE FOR HER, WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN. AND THAT MESSED THINGS UP. SO YOU GET YOUR RIGHT HAND AND YOU GO UP. MM-HM. THAT'S NOT WHO I WANTED TO BE. OH, HI, KITTY. OH, KITTY. HI, HI, HOW ARE YOU? HI. I AM EUREKA. I FOUND THIS ON YOUR PORCH, Y'ALL. OH, MY GOD, YOU HAVE TWO. SORRY. HI. HI, HUGS. I'M SARAH. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? THIS IS DECEMBER. DECEMBER, HOW ARE YOU? HI. HI. SO WHAT ARE YOU COOKING? SPAGHETTI. OH MY GOODNESS, THIS LOOKS GOOD. LET THE MAN COOK. I LOVE IT. HE COOKS SO MUCH BETTER THAN I DO. ALL I LIKE TO DO IS EAT, I'M NOT A COOK EITHER. RIGHT. LIKE ME AND DECEMBER WILL TURN ON MUSIC AND LIKE, HAVE A DANCE PARTY WHILE HE'S COOKING. SO HOW OLD IS SHE? SHE IS EIGHT YEARS OLD. EIGHT YEARS OLD, WOW. DOES SHE KNOW WHAT DRAG IS? YES, OH YES, SHE DOES. SHE DOES. OH YEAH. YES. YOU'LL BE MY DRAG DAUGHTER, OBVIOUSLY. SO I HOPE YOU'RE READY, I'M THE BEST AT WHAT I DO. ARE YOU EXCITED OR NERVOUS? YES, I'M EXCITED. EXCITED? YES. HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT BEING IN DRAG BEFORE? CHRIS'S FIRST DRAG SHOW WAS... WHEN WAS THAT? SEPTEMBER? SEPTEMBER, YES. WE WERE ALL SUPER PROUD OF HIM BECAUSE OF LIKE, HOW HE'S BEEN LIKE, REALLY IN A SHELL ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. AND THAT NIGHT THAT WE WERE ALL OUT THERE, HE WAS SITTING RIGHT UP FRONT WITH ALL OF US. AND IT WAS REALLY, YEAH, IT WAS REALLY COOL TO WATCH HIM KIND OF GET OUT OF HIS SHELL FOR THAT. YEAH, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE RAISED A CERTAIN WAY, I GUESS, HUH? YEAH, THAT WAS MY BIGGEST THING IS, I USED TO SWEEP EVERYTHING UNDER THE RUG. LIKE, I WENT YEARS WITH, I'LL GO OVER HERE. I WENT YEARS JUST NOT KNOWING THAT I HAD DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, ALL THAT STUFF. THAT WAS SOMETHING I NEVER KNEW HOW TO PROCESS. AND I JUST MADE THE DECISION ONE DAY, I WAS AT WORK AND I WAS LIKE, I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF. AND I CAME HOME AND LIKE, PLAYED IT OFF LIKE, FOR A WEEK AND THEN I FINALLY TOLD HER, "HEY, THIS HAPPENED A WEEK AGO," AND SHE WAS LIKE, "WE'RE GONNA GET YOU HELP." I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR 11 YEARS. YEAH. AND SO SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY, HE QUIT TALKING AND I QUIT TALKING. AND WE WERE BOTH EXPRESSING LIKE, HOW WE WERE FEELING. SO WE GOT HIM INTO A COUNSELOR TO JUST AND GET HIM TO A POINT WHERE HE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW HE FEELS AND STUFF. YEAH. UNFORTUNATELY, IT TOOK TOO LONG FOR US TO COMMUNICATE THE RIGHT WAY. YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF WELL, WHAT IT IS WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DIVORCE, I DON'T KNOW, WE'RE KIND OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN. YEAH. THAT'S AMAZING. AND WE'RE ABLE TO LIKE, HAVE DINNER TOGETHER AND STUFF AND BE WHO WE NEED TO BE FOR HER AND... YEAH, I CAN SEE IT, I KNOW. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. WHEN I WENT TO MY FIRST EVER DRAG SHOW, I JUST EXPERIENCED ALL THE GOOD POSITIVE ENERGY AND THEY WERE JUST SO NICE AND COOL. AND I LOVED IT. 'CAUSE THAT'S A WAY TO EXPRESS YOURSELF. I'M GONNA BE IN DRAG LATER THIS WEEK WITH YOUR DAD. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GONNA LOOK LIKE THIS WAY. OH HONEY, TRUST, I'M GONNA MAKE SURE HE'S BEAUTIFUL. I THINK THAT THIS WILL HELP ME COMMUNICATE WITH MY DAUGHTER THE RIGHT WAY I SHOULD. BECAUSE SHOWING MY EMOTION IS, THAT'S HOW I'M GONNA CONNECT WITH HER. SO I ACTUALLY NEED YOUR HELP, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A DRAG NAME FOR YOUR DAD TOO. WHAT ABOUT MIRANDA? MIRANDA? YOU'VE GOT TO ASK DADDY. YEAH. I LIKE MIRANDA. SO WE LIKE MIRANDA SO FAR? JUST MIRANDA? MIRANDA JOLES. MIRANDA JOLES, WHERE DOES JOLES COME FROM? GRANDMA? THAT'S GRANDMA'S MAIDEN NAME, LOVE IT. HI, MIRANDA JOLES, NICE TO MEET YOU, BABY. YAY, OH SO YOU'RE GONNA BE THE STYLIST? MM-HM, STYLIST, HEY. YOU'RE GONNA BE THE STYLIST, YOU'RE GONNA BE THE PRODUCER. YES. SO I NEED YOU TO SAY, "I AM THE PRODUCER." I AM THE PRODUCER. YEAH YOU ARE. GIVE ME A POUND, BOOM. I LIKE TO DO THIS. WHAT? BA-LA-LA. OKAY, ONE MORE TIME. BA-LA-LA. OH, MAMA. YES. ALL ABOUT IT. I LOVE THAT. WE'VE GOT OUR WARDROBE, STYLIST, OUR HAIR STYLIST, OUR MAKEUP ARTIST. I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING TO BE DONE TO THE NINES, HONEY. AND ME AND DECEMBER ARE GONNA MAKE SURE, AREN'T WE? YEAH. SO YOU GOT TO GIVE ME THE PUNCHY. BA-LA-LA-LA. YEAH! I THINK CHRIS WANTED TO BE AN EMOTIONAL PERSON, I THINK HE WANTED TO CARE ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER AND THE WAY I'M GONNA PLAY MY PART IN THIS IS, I'M JUST GONNA MAKE HIM HAVE FUN, I'M GONNA FORCE HIM TO OPEN UP. COME ON, GIVE US A LITTLE BIT EXTRA. AH. MIRANDA JOLES IN THE HOUSE, MOM. TO ME, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS PERFORMANCE, IT'S TIME TO GET YOUR ASS UP AND SHOW THAT BABY AND SHOW THAT WIFE WHO THE FUCK YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF. SO GUESS WHO'S HE GONNA BE? FIERCE, ICONIC, SICKENING, AND PROUD OF HIMSELF. OKAY. COME ON, MY DUTTONS. OH MY GOD Y'ALL, THIS STAGE IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN IT LOOKS, LOOK HOW TALL THIS IS. OH MOMMA, THIS IS NICE. I FEEL IT, BUT HERE'S A QUESTION, JED. YES SIR. WE'RE DOING A DRAG SHOW, HAVE YOU EVER HAD A DRAG SHOW IN THIS VENUE BEFORE? NOT AT ALL. HAVE YOU EVER HAD PEOPLE RUNNING UP TO THE STAGE TO TIP WITH DOLLAR BILLS, FIVES AND 20s? NO. THANK YOU, BABY. THANK YOU, BABY. HAVE YOU EVER HAD DRAG QUEENS ROLLING THROUGH AND TRYING TO GET ACROSS TO THE MONEY BY THE PEOPLE OVER HERE, AND DOING A TWERK SESSION ON THE FRONT ROW? NO. SO WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO THAT THOUGH? WHAT WE DO HERE IN THIS THEATER IS CLEAN, WHOLESOME ENTERTAINMENT. WE PUT ON A FAMILY FRIENDLY SHOW, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. SOMETIMES. IT'S NOT ALWAYS TWERK SHOWS, SOMETIMES IT IS, I MEAN, LIKE EVERYONE SAYS WE OFFEND PEOPLE AND I WOULD SAY, "YOU KNOW, WE HAVE FAMILIES TOO, SO WE UNDERSTAND FAMILIES." HOWEVER, WE MIGHT BE IN A TWO-PIECE CROP TOP, FRENCH WITH THE CHEEKS OUT. THAT'S POSSIBLE. YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO MRS. DUTTON. YES SIR. NOT THIS PLACE. OH. NOT THIS PLACE. "THE SILENT MAJORITY STANDS WITH TRUMP." WHAT? "MISUNDERSTOOD BY SOME, LOVED BY MILLIONS, A SYMBOL OF COURAGE, HONOR AND VALOR." YEAH, I DON'T THINK THEY'VE CREATED A SAFE SPACE. I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO SEE US, GIRL. THIS IS WHAT I WAS TELLING YOU, NOW THIS PLACE, THEY DO CONCERTS IN HERE. SO IT'S LIKE A THEATER LIFESTYLE PLACE, SO IT'S GONNA HAVE A STAGE FOR SURE. YEAH, IT'S A THEATER. AND IT'S GONNA HAVE LIKE PROBABLY -- SOMEBODY NEEDS TO TALK TO SOMEBODY DOWN HERE. YES, MA'AM, HI. HI. YOU WERE HERE BEFORE. HELLO? HOW MAY I HELP YOU? THIS IS A THEATER THOUGH, YES MA'AM? OH WE WERE JUST COMING TO LOOK AT THE THEATER AND SCOPE IT OUT FOR A LOCATION TO POTENTIALLY PERFORM IN. YEAH, WE'RE LOOKING TO DO LIKE, A DRAG SHOW TYPE EVENT HERE. I DON'T THINK SHE WANTS TO CONVERSE. WE'RE JUST VISITING, WE JUST GOT TO TOWN. I WASN'T HERE -- OKAY. SORRY. THEY WANT US TO EVACUATE THE PREMISES, LIKE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, CALL THE LAW? WELL, LET'S GIVE THIS NICE LADY HER PHONE BACK. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, BYE-BYE. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MA'AM. WHAT IN THE -- GOD BLESS. WHAT IN THE WORLD. GETTING THE LAW. I'M NOT CHRISTIAN. I'M NOT. I CAN'T STAND HERE IN FRONT OF YOU AND SAY THAT I BELIEVE AND I HAVE FAITH AND I DON'T. BUT I RAISED MY CHILDREN AND BRANSON, WHICH IS VERY CHRISTIAN-BASED. I WOULD SAY THAT 80 TO 90% OF THE RESIDENTS IN BRANSON ARE CHRISTIAN. THAT IS WHAT YOU HEAR, THAT IS WHAT YOU SEE. THERE IS NOTHING IN BRANSON THAT SAYS, "BE GAY." BUT TWO OUT OF MY THREE CHILDREN ARE GAY. MY MIDDLE SON DONOVAN, STRUGGLED INTERNALLY ALL HIS LIFE BEFORE HE WAS COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO BE LIKE, "THIS IS ME." AND NOW TANNER IS STRUGGLING. WHEN I CAME OUT AS A CHRISTIAN AND NOT GAY ANYMORE, WITH MY MOM, IT WAS KIND OF A TAILSPIN FOR HER. AND I'M SO SCARED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT, BECAUSE LIKE, THIS IS HIS LIFE. I GUESS IT HURTS BECAUSE IT DOES CREATE THIS DISTANCE. I JUST WANT HIM TO BE HAPPY. WELCOME TO CAMP, CAMP. OH. OH MY. HEY, THIS IS MY SPACE. YAY. ARE YOU EXCITED, ARE YOU NERVOUS? I'M SO EXCITED. ARE YOU JAZZY, ARE YOU? I'M A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH, I THINK. YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE WE REALLY DON'T KNOW KIND OF LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT YOUR VISION IS. SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT. SO WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT IS, BOTH OF YOU APPEARANCE AT THE SHOW. I WAS THINKING TO MYSELF LIKE, HOW CAN I INCORPORATE Y'ALL'S NARRATIVE, Y'ALL'S STORY INTO THE BIGGER PICTURE, INTO A STORY THAT WE CAN TELL ON STAGE. AND MORE THAN ANYTHING, I REALLY WANT THIS TO SPEAK TO YOU. CAN I ASK YOU, WHAT DO YOU WANT TANNER TO TAKE FROM THIS? IT'S SUCH A HARD QUESTION, BECAUSE I HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. LIKE, I KNOW THAT YOU STILL DEAL WITH YOUR SAID DEMON OF BEING ATTRACTED TO MEN, STILL. AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO SACRIFICE YOUR TIME ON THIS EARTH, YOUR LIFE HERE. AND BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THE WAY YOU DO, IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO STOMACH YOU LIVING LIFE WITHOUT LOVE. AND I JUST WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY WITH WHO YOU ARE, WHETHER YOU'RE GAY OR STRAIGHT OR WHATEVER. I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE LOVE IN YOUR LIFE, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT. HERE. THAT'S THE THING, I DO HAVE LOVE IN MY LIFE. I HAVE YOU. I HAVE GOD. YOU KNOW, LOVE ISN'T JUST ME BEING ABLE TO COME HOME TO SOMEONE AND SAY, "THIS IS MY PARTNER, THIS IS THE PERSON WHO I'M LIVING WITH FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE." LOVE IS SO MUCH MORE DEEPER THAN THAT. AND I KNOW HOW, FROM AN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE IT COULD SEEM THAT I'M HURTING. BUT YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST EVERY DAY LIFE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NEVER GONNA BE A POINT IN THIS LIFE THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE DEALING WITH SOME SORT OF HARDSHIP. AND I NEVER WOULD ONCE CONDEMN YOU OR JUDGE YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M AT. UNDERSTANDING THAT, YOU KNOW, YOUR BRAIN IS DIFFERENT THAN MINE, YOUR EXPERIENCES ARE DIFFERENT THAN MINE. BUT MY JOB IS TO LOVE YOU, REGARDLESS OF IT. IT'S FINE. I'M OKAY. OKAY. I PROMISE. OKAY. I LOVE YOU. YOU GOT TO START GETTING UNDRESSED, GIRL. BE BODY POSITIVE, DON'T BE SHY. SO TUCK, RIGHT? YOU HAVE UNDERWEAR, RIGHT? YEAH. ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA TRY, BUT... WHAT'S HAPPENING? SO I HAD A VASECTOMY. OKAY. LIKE, I WENT INTO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE, HE WENT TO PULL DOWN MY PANTS. YOU KNOW, THEY EXAMINE THEM, CHECK 'EM OUT. AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID, "THOSE ARE THE BIGGEST SET OF BALLS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE." WHAT? AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO THIS IN AN OPERATING ROOM. THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY BE THAT BIG. YEP, THEY ARE. WELL, THEN I NEED YOU TO JUST PUT THIS ON AND JUST PUSH EVERYTHING BACK AND TRY TO PULL IT WITH THIS, FOR THE BIG GIRLS. ALL RIGHT. DO YOU NEED ME TO HELP YOU PULL 'EM OUT? YEAH. OKAY, I'M COMING. OH, MY GOD! LOOK AT THESE BALLS! I'M JUST KIDDING. WE HAVE SOME COLOR OPTIONS. I LIKE A COOLER BLOND, THIS IS -- WELL, I'LL DO IT YOUR WAY, BECAUSE THESE ARE HIS OPTIONS. OH, OH. LOOK AT HIM DRESS, YOU GOT RIGHT INTO 'EM, DIDN'T YOU? LOOK, NOW DON'T BREAK AN ANKLE 'CAUSE YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO NEXT SEASON. OH, NEVER MIND. ALL RIGHT, NOT TOO MUCH NOW. OH, EEH. YES. YOU ARE MID-AMERICA'S NIGHTMARE. YEAH. I'M ALL FOR BEING LIKE, ALL OVER THE TOP BUT WITHOUT BEATING AROUND THE BUSH, I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE, PRESENT THE WOMAN ASPECT. WHATEVER YOUR LIMIT IS, WE'RE GONNA STEP THAT UP. YEAH, UM. YEAH, REMEMBER YOUR FEMALE HIP I TOLD YOU IS ALL THE WAY UP HERE. SO NOW YOU'VE GOT A FEMALE HIP. CHRIS IS SUPER INTO WRESTLING, SO WE'RE GONNA DO A WRESTLING NUMBER. BUT WE'RE ABOUT TO SISSY THE FUCK OUT OF IT. IT DON'T MATTER HOW STRAIGHT YOU ARE, MOMMA, YOU'RE GONNA POP RUBY UP AND YOU'RE GONNA GIVE SASS. WOULD THE LINE BE BREASTS? HIPS? YEAH. THIS ALL RIGHT. OH, LOOK AT THOSE TITTIES. I FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT WE CAN STAY SAFE ENOUGH, I MEAN, I'M NOT GONNA GO CRAZY, BUT IT'LL BE A LITTLE CRAZY. EXCITING. OKAY, GIVE ME A LITTLE SASHAY AROUND THIS TABLE. SASHAY, SHANTAY, SHANTAY, SHANTAY, SHANTAY. ALMOST. ALL RIGHT, THAT WAS REALLY TERRIBLE. YEAH, I KNOW. YOU WALK LIKE A CLYDESDALE. I WANT YOU TO LET GO OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT ABOUT BEING A TENSE MASCULINE PERSON OR MAN. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND OR EVEN HAVE MAYBE WRAPPED YOUR HEART AROUND THE IDEA OF LIKE, THE PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO HELP. NOT JUST STRAIGHT MEN, BUT ALSO LGBT MEMBERS BY PUTTING YOURSELF IN THIS VULNERABLE POSITION AND BEING ABLE TO LIKE, LOOK PAST SOCIETY'S LABEL OF WHAT A MAN IS. BECAUSE WE'RE CONSTANTLY TOLD WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO IT. AND WHEN PEOPLE LIKE YOU TAKE THAT STEP, IT VALIDATES PEOPLE THAT AREN'T CHOOSING A SIDE, YOU KNOW. IT WAS JUST THIS GEAR, DAMN IT. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. HOLD MOMMA'S HAND. TALK TO US. WHEN SARAH AND I FIRST BROUGHT UP THAT WE WERE GONNA GET A DIVORCE AND EVERYTHING, SAM WAS OVER AT HER GRANDMA'S, I WENT OVER THERE AND IT WAS JUST THIS YEAR THAT DECEMBER SAW ME CRY FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. SO I THINK IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT, THAT I REALIZED LIKE, I HAVE TO SHOW EMOTION FOR MY DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE'S EIGHT YEAR'S OLD AND THAT'S NOT OKAY FOR HER TO NOT KNOW LIKE, DAD NEVER CRIES, LIKE, IN MY MIND THAT DIDN'T FIT WELL WITH ME. YOU HAVE TO TEACH HER IT'S OKAY TO HAVE FEELINGS, YOU KNOW. AND THAT SHE HAS TO PROCESS THEM. YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT, YOU KNOW. AND NOW I THINK YOU'RE EVEN MORE EMOTIONAL BECAUSE YOU'RE FINALLY IN TUNE WITH THAT EMOTIONAL SIDE. BECAUSE YOU'RE NO LONGER LOOKING AT THIS LIKE, GENDER ROLE. AND YOU'VE HELD IT IN FOR SO LONG, THAT HAS TO COME OUT. YEAH. THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU ANY LESS OF A MAN, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. YEAH, I'VE PUT MYSELF LIVING IN FEAR OF NOT WANTING TO CONNECT WITH HER AND FACE THOSE SITUATIONS WITH EVERYTHING THAT SHE'S HAD GOING ON. LOOK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE AND KNOW THAT NOW, MOVING FORWARD, YOU'RE GONNA BE THE BEST DAD YOU CAN BE, BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE BEST YOU YOU CAN BE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? MM-HM. AND HOWEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT TO ACT, YOU CAN. THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU A BAD PERSON OR LESS OF A MAN. YEAH. IT MAKES YOU PERFECTLY YOU, YOU KNOW. OH THIS IS CUTE. JUST IN, LIKE, LOOKING FOR SPACES TO DO A SHOW HERE, WE'VE HAD A FEW PLACES THAT WERE LESS THAN FRIENDLY. COME ON IN, THIS IS THE EVENTS ROOM. OH, WOW. YEAH, SO WE USE THIS FOR ALL TYPES OF EVENTS. OH YES, YES, YES. WELL, I'M ACTUALLY JUST REALLY CURIOUS, HAVE YOU ALL EVER HAD A DRAG SHOW HERE BEFORE? NO. OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE TOWN? NO. REALLY? YEAH. YOU EVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE ANY THING CENTERED AROUND THE QUEER COMMUNITY HERE BEFORE? IT'S JUST KIND OF, I THINK, JUST EVOLVING, YOU KNOW, SO YEAH. THE CRAZIEST PART IS, IS WE'VE BEEN TOLD NO A LOT, SO WE'RE ACTUALLY JUST REALLY EXCITED THAT... FEELING A YES. SO. WE'VE LITERALLY BEEN RUN OUT OF A COUPLE OF PLACES, LITERALLY. WE'RE ACCOMMODATING, SO THAT'S NO PROBLEM. HOLD ON, BEFORE WE LEAVE, IF YOU DON'T MIND. WHERE ARE THE DRESSING ROOMS? DRESSING ROOMS ARE GONNA BE OUT ON THE PRINCESS. ON THE PRINCESS? IS THAT A BOAT? YES. THAT'S OUR YACHT. OH, ON THE YACHT. OH. I'M FEELING VERY GOLDIE HAWN, "OVERBOARD." OH YES, NOW THIS IS MY GIG. WELL SHANGE, YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN STAND UP IN YOUR HEELS.

THE IDEA OF OVER-EXAGGERATED FEMININITY IS THAT WE MAKE IT CLASSY AND BEAUTIFUL. FEET STARTING TO HURT? YEAH. WELCOME TO DRAG. JUMP UP. YEAH. AND YOUR LEGS ARE HERE. SICKENING.

LIKE, I DON'T THINK ANYONE THINKS LIKE, "OH MY GOD, TANNER'S CRAZY." YEARS AGO, IF SOMEONE SAID, YOU ARE EXCEPTIONAL BUT YOU'RE NOT THE EXCEPTION, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WHEN I WAS YOUNG, MY MOM TOLD ME SHE WAS A LESBIAN. AND THEN WHEN I WAS IN LIKE, HIGH SCHOOL, MY MOM WAS BORN AGAIN. AND THEN SHE WAS LIKE, "THAT'S NOT ME ANYMORE." AND THEN I CALLED HER LAST NIGHT AND I WAS LIKE, "MA, WHAT DO I SAY TANNER SO THAT I CAN HAVE RESPECT TO HIS RELIGION?" AND MY MOM WAS LIKE, IT TOOK HER A WHILE TO REALIZE THAT SHE IS A PERFECT DESIGN, THERE WERE NO FLAWS. MY MOM SAID WHEN SHE WAS BEING CREATED, THERE WAS NO OOPSIES, THERE WASN'T TOO MUCH OF THIS, TOO LITTLE OF THIS. THE WAY SHE WAS MADE IS THE WAY SHE WAS MADE INTENTIONALLY. YOU ARE A PERFECT DESIGN. I FEEL LIKE WE RAN INTO TANNER AT A REALLY PIVOTAL POINT IN HIS LIFE. I THINK THAT HE'S FIGURING OUT WHAT HAPPINESS MEANS FOR HIM. I HOPE THIS IS THERAPEUTIC, THAT'S WHAT I HOPE.

I FOUND IN LIFE THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS COINCIDENCE. TANNER, TANNER. TANNER, TANNER. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE SO MUCH LOVE IN YOUR LIFE AND THIS WAS JUST ANOTHER REMINDER OF YOU KNOW, ALL THE PEOPLE WHO I HAVE IN MY LIFE THAT ARE SUPPORTING ME. WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. THE SEPARATION BETWEEN CHRISTIAN AND LGBT, THAT ISN'T A SEPARATION BY GOD, THAT IS A SEPARATION BY PEOPLE. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LET OTHER PEOPLE LOVE YOU, SO YOU CAN FULLY LOVE YOURSELF. IT GOES BACK TO THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE, EVERYONE WANTS PEACE AND HAPPINESS. WE ALL STRUGGLE AND WE CAN ALL OVERCOME. YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, OKAY. WE DID IT! IT WAS FUN. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. I FEEL LIKE A SUPERSTAR. IT WAS REALLY AMAZING. THERE'S A THING ABOUT DRAG, IT'S LIKE YOU CAN CONQUER THE WORLD. AND ONCE YOU FEEL THAT, IT MAKES YOU WANT TO START CHANGING THINGS IN YOUR LIFE, SO THAT YOU CAN FEEL THAT WAY AGAIN. WELL, SO THIS TIME OR WHEN YOU'RE AT THE POOL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA WEAR? A SPEEDO. A SPEEDO. THIS IS GONNA BE A MEMORY HE'S GONNA HOLD FOREVER, NOT ONLY FOR HIM, BUT ALSO FOR HIS DAUGHTER. AND THAT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PART ABOUT THAT. YOU LOOK SO CUTE. WHEN YOU'RE ABLE JUST TO PUT ON THE ARMOR OF WHO YOU ARE AND WALK IN THAT TRUTH. THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. THAT'S DRAG. I FEEL LIKE A MIX OF LIKE, CINDEL AND DAVID BOWIE. A LITTLE CINDEL, YEAH. I THINK HE FEELS REALLY LOVED RIGHT NOW. AND WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR, RIGHT? YOU KNOW. I JUST WANT HIM TO BE HAPPY, I JUST WANT THEM ALL TO BE HAPPY. Hello! Lord, I put on all this for nothing? We are in Farmington, New Mexico. Hopefully, we can show Farmington what fun looks like! - Ah! - Oh God, oh God. - Ok, alright. - Ah! Oh my God. As an indigenous gay male, on the reservation, I was picked on, I was scared. We all accepted her, but I think she knew that other people didn't. I want to create support from the community here in Farmington. That's what drag does; it helps you create strength that you don't know where to find it. You have the spotlight, and they have to listen. Let's cause a scene.
