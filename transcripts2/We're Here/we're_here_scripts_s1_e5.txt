 FROM, LIKE, EIGHTH OR NINTH GRADE, THE ONLY WAY I COULD FIT IN WAS IF I DID ALL THE COUNTRY BOY STUFF, SO I DID IT, SO THAT WAY I COULD GO CAMPING WITH THEM. YOU LIKED IT, I KNOW, LIKE? YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE WENT CAMPING. SO, I WAS LIKE, MAMA, ALL "BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN" FISH. WE ARE UP IN NORTH LOUISIANA, SPECIFICALLY, RUSTON, LOUISIANA. DRIVING INTO RUSTON, IT'S LIKE, SO SOUTHERN. IT'S LIKE FIELDS, COWS ARE EVERYWHERE. THERE'S NOT EVEN 20,000 PEOPLE, I THINK, POPULATION IN THIS TOWN. HIYA! THESE BAKED GOODS LOOK SO DELICIOUS. I HEARD Y'ALL HAD COUNTRY CANNOLIS. THEY ARE. THEY'RE REDNECK CANNOLIS. HELLO! HELLO! DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING SWEET? UM, YES, SIR. THAT WILL BE -- SIR? MA'AM. THAT'S OKAY, BABY, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT TO WATCH THAT BIRD, BABY, WATCH THAT BIRD! THROUGH THE WING, OVER THE BIRD, THERE WE GO. OOH! SHOW THEM HIPS OFF, BABY. THERE WE GO. OH, WORK. GONNA TIE IT, CINCH IT, THAT WAIST. YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU LIKE? RUSTON, YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY CIVILIZED AND VERY FABULOUS, BUT IT'S STILL THE COUNTRY, BITCH, ALL RIGHT? I KIND OF THINK IT IS A QUEER WATERING HOLE IN RUSTON, LOUISIANA. HELLO? SWEET -- WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE STORE? UPTOWN DOWNTOWN. UPTOWN DOWNTOWN. HELLO? UPTOWN DOWNTOWN, MAY I HELP YOU? DO YOU KNOW HOW TO REALLY EAT A CUPCAKE? THERE IS NOT A TECHNICAL WAY. SHOW ME. LOOK. YOU TAKE THAT BOTTOM AND YOU DO IT LIKE THIS, AND THEN YOU DON'T GET YOUR LIPSTICK MESSED UP. YOU ARE LYING! YOU ARE CHANGING MY LIFE RIGHT NOW! WE HAVE COOKIES AND SNICKERDOODLES AND THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE WAFFLES. THE THING ABOUT SMALL TOWNS LIKE THIS IS, THEY DON'T WANT CHANGE. BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS READY FOR A CHANGE. BIG CAKES, LITTLE CAKES, SWEET CAKES, CANNOLI CAKES. SO IT'S LIKE, YOU'VE GOT TO START SHARKING THINGS UP AND YOU GOT TO START DOING NEW THINGS IN AN AREA TO REALLY KIND OF CHANGE THE AREA. STRAWBERRY COVERED MUSHROO -- NO, THAT'S NOT MUSHROOM. STRAWBERRY. OH, CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRY. HELLO? I GUESS THEY DIDN'T WANT IT. HOW TALL ARE THESE SHOES, BECAUSE YOU ARE, LIKE, TOWERING OVER ME. I'M 5'5" WITHOUT THE HEELS. OKAY, SO WE WOULD BE, LIKE, EQUALS. NO, I'M NOT. AND I'M, LIKE, AND I'M ACTUALLY ONLY 140 WITHOUT THE PADDING, SO. OH, REALLY? ME TOO, BABY, ME TOO. IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED THING, JUST TO BE YOURSELF IN A SMALL TOWN WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU. LIKE, I ALWAYS TRY TO NOT BRING TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO ME, BECAUSE THE MORE ATTENTION THERE IS ON ME, THE HARDER IT IS HERE IN RUSTON. 'CAUSE ANYTHING THAT YOU DO, EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THE NEXT DAY. AT WORK, I HAVE TO BE ALMOST STRAIGHT, HAVE TO MAKE SURE I AM TALKING TO PEOPLE WITH A DEEPER VOICE. I HAVE TO MAKE SURE, LIKE, I DON'T, YOU KNOW, DO SOMETHING THAT MIGHT INDICATE THAT I'M GAY. IT MAKES ME SAD. PEOPLE GO YEARS AND YEARS AND THEY WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE, LIKE, 60, 70 TO FINALLY JUST BE THEMSELVES. I DON'T WANT TO BE SUFFERING TO ALL OF THAT. BUT EVEN WITH MY FAMILY, I DON'T FEEL SUPPORTED. WHENEVER I WAS BEING A LITTLE BIT OF MYSELF AND I WAS GOING OUT WITH GUYS AND PEOPLE WERE SEEING ME AND STUFF, MY MOM GOT ATTACKED AT CHURCH BECAUSE OF THAT. AND THEN SHE BROUGHT THAT BACK TO ME AND SHE WAS, LIKE, TELLING ME NOT TO DO IT AGAIN. SO I FEEL LIKE I'M THE PROBLEM MOST OF THE TIME. I'M JUST TIRED OF NOT BEING ABLE TO BE ME, AND I DON'T FEEL WANTED. OH, TRUMP 2020 SIGNS AT THE DOOR. NEVER SAYS "WELCOME." OKAY, HELLO. HI. HELLO, GUYS. HELLO! HEY! HI! LOOK AT THIS PLACE. DID SOMEBODY SAVE ME A SPACE FOR CRAWFISH? RIGHT HERE. YEAH! GOOD, RIGHT. YOU MUST BE JOSE? I AM, YES. NICE TO MEET YOU. CAN I BE HONEST WITH Y'ALL? UH-HUH. I'VE NEVER HAD CRAWFISH BEFORE. WHAT? REALLY? AND I'M FROM TEXAS. LOOK, I'M SCARED, I'M JUST TELLING YOU, I HAVE NEVER HAD IT. OH, THESE ARE NOT INDIVIDUAL PLATES, RIGHT? YEAH. YEAH. ARE YOU SERIOUS? YOU GOT TO REALIZE, HALF OF IT IS SHELL. HERE WE GO, YES! ALL RIGHT, SO, HOW WOULD YOU ATTACK THE CRAWFISH? WELL, I HAVE A COUSIN THAT LIVES IN HOUSTON AND SHE SAY YOU TAKE ONE END OFF FIRST. HA, HA! BYE-BYE, I THROW THIS PART IN THE TRASH, IN THE THING? NO, NO, NO! 'CAUSE I GOT TO SHOW YOU, SHE -- I MEAN, YOU CAN SUCK THE HEAD. SATURDAY NIGHT! THERE YOU GO. THAT'S VERY GOOD. WHOO! THIS IS FUN, OKAY, I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME! SO I'M PARTNERING WITH JOSE HERE, AND HE'S GONNA BECOME MY NEW DRAG DAUGHTER, AND WE'RE PROGRAMMING A SHOW HERE FOR NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT. I'M STARTING TO GET NERVOUS. JUST, IT'S ALL AT ONCE, ALL THE FEELINGS AT ONCE, LIKE, JUST LOT. I THINK HE'S AT A TIME IN HIS LIFE. HE NEEDS IT. HE NEEDS IT. BUT YOU ALSO GOT TO REMEMBER, THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU, THIS IS ABOUT THE OTHER LITTLE, CUTE LITTLE MEXICAN BOYS WHO ARE LIKE, I WANT TO BE FREE. AT TIMES, DO YOU FEEL UNFREE? YEAH, LIKE, HELD BACK? YEAH. WHAT MAKES YOU FEEL THAT WAY? JUST NOT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MYSELF. JUST NOT BEING ABLE TO GO OUT THERE AND JUST BE MYSELF. WHEN YOU'RE IN A SMALL COMMUNITY, I COULD TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. ANY LITTLE THING THEY CAN, LIKE, TAKE AND TRY TO, YOU KNOW, PUT YOU DOWN. EVERY TIME I GO OUT, LIKE, OUT IN PUBLIC, LIKE, I'M JUST BY MYSELF, I AM NOT COMFORTABLE. AS SOON AS HE'S THERE, I DON'T CARE, I CAN BE MYSELF BECAUSE HE'S THERE AND HE'S, LIKE, THE, LIKE, HE'S THE LIFEGUARD, LIKE, HE'S LIKE THE -- WHAT'S IT CALLED? HE'S BIG MAMA. HE'S JUST -- HE'S JUST BIG MAMA, YEAH. I CAN BE MYSELF AROUND MY FRIEND, MARIO, 'CAUSE HE'S SO CONFIDENT ABOUT HIMSELF, IT'S CONTAGIOUS. HOW TALL ARE YOU? I'M A BIG GUY. I'M 6'1" AND A HALF, AND I'M 250 LBS. SO, BASICALLY, IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING IF SOMEONE STARTS MESSING WITH YOU. OH, YEAH. LIKE, MY GRANDPA, HE'S PASSED, BUT HE ALWAYS TOLD ME, PEOPLE TREAT YOU HOW YOU ALLOW THEM TO, SO. AMEN. IF YOU LET SOMEBODY RUN OVER YOU, THEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE GONNA RUN OVER YOU. RIGHT. NOT ME! RIGHT, RIGHT. BUT I WANT HIM TO BE ABLE TO BE HIMSELF WITHOUT ME BEING AROUND. I CAN TELL THAT JOSE DRAWS A LOT OF STRENGTH FROM JAMARIO. SEEING THAT EXAMPLE OF QUEER CONFIDENCE, JOSE GETS TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONFIDENCE IN HIMSELF. IT'S 2020. YOU, HER, HER, HER, WHATEVER. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO WEAR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO WEAR. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE WHO YOU WANT TO BE. I THINK THAT'S WHY I REALLY AM EXCITED THAT WE'RE COMING HERE AND DOING, LIKE, A DRAG SHOW HERE. BUT TRUST ME. THERE IS NO COMPLETE 180 SHIFT IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IN A WEEK. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. I KNOW, YOU KNOW, FAIRY GODMOTHER, FABULOUS AS I AM, I AIN'T NO FAIRY GODMOTHER, TO COME AND LIKE, BING, AND THE WHOLE LIFE IS CHANGED. THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. BUT WHAT CAN HAPPEN, IF YOU'RE OPEN TO IT, IS YOU'LL START TO GET THOSE TOOLS AND REINFORCE HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT COMES FROM, HOW WE FEEL ABOUT OURSELVES AT THE END OF THE DAY. SO I'M EXCITED, AND I HOPE YOU GUYS WILL COME TO THE SHOW. OF COURSE! IT'S TUESDAY? TUESDAY. OKAY, WELL, I WILL SEE Y'ALL AGAIN SOON. WISH ME LUCK, I DON'T HAVE AN UMBRELLA. BYE! LOOK AT THIS MAN! THAT'S KARL MALONE. HE'S A BASKETBALL PLAYER, AIN'T HE? HE WAS LIKE THE SECOND OR THIRD -- OH! HEY! SO SORRY. DON'T BE FOOLIN' WITH KARL, NOW! I APOLOGIZE, KARL! I'M SORRY, KARL! THANK Y'ALL. RUSTON IS A TOWN THAT'S SO FAR BEHIND. IT'S JUST CLOSED MIND, BAPTIST AMERICA. IT'S, ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST PUSH OUR BELIEF ON EVERYBODY ELSE. WE DON'T CARE WHO WE OFFEND, WE DON'T CARE WHO WE DISCOURAGE. WE'RE JUST GONNA, YOU KNOW, GET THIS MESSAGE OUT THERE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT GOD WANT US TO DO. AS A LIFE-LONG RESIDENT, 30 YEARS OF LIVING HERE, TEN YEARS AT THE FIRE HOUSE, SO I'M VERY DATED TO CERTAIN ASPECTS. I'M A HETEROSEXUAL MALE, BUT I THINK, FOR A GAY PERSON LIVING IN RUSTON, THE TOWN THAT I KNOW, IT IS SO HARD TO BE OPENLY WHO YOU ARE HERE. BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA MISTREAT NOBODY, JUST BECAUSE YOU MAY NOT LIKE WHAT THEY DO, IN FRONT OF ME. A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD VIEW ME AS A MANLY MAN. I'VE BOUNCED AT BARS. I'VE ALSO BEEN A FIREMAN, AND I'VE ALWAYS HAD THESE, LIKE, JUST MANLY PROFESSIONS. I MEAN, I'M WILLING TO STEP OUTSIDE MY COMFORT ZONE TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE WELCOME. IT'S 2020, SO I MEAN, IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO CHANGE IN 2020, THEN THERE'S NO HELP FOR YOU. HEY! HOW ARE YOU, MAN? I'M GOOD, HOW ARE YOU? I'M GOOD, YEAH, YEAH, STACY. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. HOW OFTEN DO YOU COME TO THIS BAR? I MEAN, IF I'M IN TOWN, THEN EVERY NIGHT. THEY KNOW WHO I AM WHEN I WALK THROUGH THE DOOR. YOU DON'T REALLY GET THAT IN A LOT OF PLACES, YOU'RE ALWAYS A NUMBER. I HEARD THAT YOU ARE THE UNOFFICIAL BOUNCER HERE? YEAH, SOMETIMES. YOU THINK SUNDOWN IS LIKE AN INCLUSIVE PLACE FOR EVERYONE? VERY MUCH SO. I MEAN IT. IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE ONLY ONES THAT. AROUND HERE. JUST LIKE A CHILL PLACE AND SOME, THAT YOU CAN COME AND FEEL COMFORTABLE. GOT IT. MYSELF AND MANY OTHERS INCLUDED HAVE BEEN GOING TO SUNDOWN A WHOLE LOT. YOU'RE GONNA FIND PEOPLE THERE IN ALL TYPES OF WALKS OF LIFE. IT'S KIND OF LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOUR VERY PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITIES, THAT'S SUNDOWN IN THE WHOLE. IS THERE ANYONE IN TOWN THAT YOU, LIKE, SPECIFICALLY WANT TO SEE THIS OR, LIKE, NEEDS TO SEE THIS OR WOULD GET A KICK OUT OF THIS? I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS THAT, I MEAN, YOU KNOW -- NOT TO BRAG. YEAH, YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S JUST LIKE, THAT'S WHO I AM. I MEAN, LOOK, TO MAKE CONVERSATION AND TO CREATE RELATIONSHIPS. AND BY DOING THIS, YOU KNOW, BY ME BEING AN ALLY, I THINK IT HOPEFULLY OPEN OTHER PEOPLE EYES, YOU KNOW, TO BE AN ALLY. WORK. WHAT WOULD YOU WANT FOR, LIKE, A STAGE NAME? YOU KNOW, BEING THAT I HAVE A UNISEX NAME, I DON'T KNOW, STACY. I CAN'T, IN GOOD FAITH, SAY THAT'S NOT AN EXCITING NAME, BECAUSE MY NAME IS BOB, SO OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T BE, LIKE, STACY'S NOT EXCITING, BECAUSE BOB'S NOT EXCITING. SO, HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU GONNA MEET THAT HAD A UNISEX NAME, YOU KNOW? YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR BEARD? I'VE BEEN DREADING THAT EVEN, LIKE, JUST BROACHING IT, BECAUSE I MEAN, I FINALLY GREW A BEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME, AFTER GROWING UP, DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE CHANCE, THEN YEAH. LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF WORK. LISTEN, THERE IS... I LOVE BEARDED DRAG. I'VE NEVER DONE IT MYSELF, SO THIS WOULD BE ACTUALLY REALLY EXCITING TO INCORPORATE THIS. I'M DOWN. WHATEVER YOU COME UP WITH, YOU LET ME KNOW. IT'S GOING TO GET A LITTLE DIFFERENT. I THINK, LIKE, WHAT STACY IS DOING WITH THIS SHOW IS INSANELY IMPORTANT. HE'S A FIREFIGHTER, HE STANDS UP FOR PEOPLE, AND IF YOU ARE RESPECTED AND YOU SET AN EXAMPLE AND YOU DO SOMETHING FOR OTHER PEOPLE, THEN OTHER PEOPLE DO IT TOO. I MEAN, I WEAR A PAIR OF CREASE PANTS AND COWBOY BOOTS DAILY, BUT BRING IT ON. LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE YOU CROSS THE STREET. HI, HI, HI. I'M LOOKING FOR LYNN. WORK! HI! I AM EUREKA, ACTUALLY IS MY NAME. OH MY GOD, HI! I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET YOU. HI, EUREKA. YOU'RE SEXY. WORK! HI, BABE. HEY! YOU'RE SO CUTE! IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME IN RUSTON, LOUISIANA? OH, YEAH. BUT I'VE BEEN TO NEW ORLEANS. LIKE, THE BIG GAY PART.. THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE. I CAN TELL! I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED. IT'S A FIVE-HOUR RIDE, BUT IT'S A WORLD AWAY. YOU'RE BAD ASS, LYNN, I CAN TELL. KIND OF, SOMETIMES. IT'S NOT JUST THE TATTOOS, YOU KNOW. WHAT'S THESE TATTOOS ALL ABOUT? TELL ME MORE. OKAY, LET ME TELL YOU MY STORIES. THIS IS THE OHM, BECAUSE I HAD TO REMIND MYSELF TO BREATHE AFTER MY ACCIDENT. TO BREATHE? JUST BREATHE. NOW, THE EAGLE WAS THE LATEST AND GREATEST. I ACTUALLY, PRIOR TO MY ACCIDENT, HAD AN EAGLE SOARING OVER A STORM CLOUD TATTOOED ON THIS ARM. REALLY? YES. SO THE EAGLE DURING A STORM WILL ACTUALLY RISE ABOVE IT AND USE THE DRAFT FROM THE STORM TO FLOAT ALONG. TO FLY? AND SO THAT'S KIND OF WHAT MY LIFE HAS BEEN LATELY. WHAT HAPPENED? DO YOU MIND? I'M SORRY. SO I WAS HIT HEAD-ON BY SOMEBODY. THEY CAME OVER TO MY LANE. I DON'T HAVE ANY RECOLLECTION OF THEM DOING THAT, WHICH IS, I THINK, WONDERFUL, BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR ME TO DRIVE OR TO BE OUT ON THE STREETS. YOU DIDN'T SEE IT BASICALLY? NEVER SAW HIM COMING, NO. I WAS COMING AROUND A CORNER AND HE JUST PEELED, HIT ME AND THEN CONTINUED ANOTHER 150, 160 FT DOWN THE ROAD BEFORE HE CAME TO A STOP. I HAD MY ARM AND MY LEG RIPPED FROM MY BODY. WOW. SO, YEAH. HOW ARE YOU ALL DOING NOW? IT'S BEEN A ROUGH GO OF IT BECAUSE I WAS A MOTORCYCLE RIDER AND VERY INDEPENDENT AND SELF-EMPLOYED AND JUST, I WAS STRONG. I REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO ASK FOR HELP MUCH. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I'M TRYING TO LEARN WHO I AM, AND THERE ARE DAYS THAT I GO, I CAN'T DO THIS. I MEAN, IN THE BEGINNING WHEN I FIRST CAME TO WORK HERE, I WOULD SAY THERE WAS PROBABLY AT LEAST ONE DAY A WEEK THAT I WOULD SAY, "HEY, I CAN'T COME IN." YEAH. AND IT WAS BECAUSE I EITHER COULDN'T GET MY LEG ON RIGHT, SO I JUST PHYSICALLY COULDN'T COME IN, OR I COULDN'T GET MY HEAD ON RIGHT. YEAH. AND SO MENTALLY I JUST COULDN'T DO IT. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE, I WOULD HAVE NEVER MET MY WIFE IF THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN. WOW. SO, YEAH. SO YOU FEEL PRETTY ACCEPTED HERE? I MEAN, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT I'M A LESBIAN. EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M MARRIED TO A WOMAN. I KNOW THERE'S ENVIRONMENTS WHERE IT'S MUCH MORE ACCEPTED. YEAH. NEW ORLEANS, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD BE A PLACE THAT YOU CAN GO AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT, PROBABLY, AT ALL. WHEREAS HERE, YOU KNOW, I THINK A LOT OF US ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE SUBDUED THAN WE MIGHT BE. WELL, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN DRAG BEFORE? NEVER! NEVER. SO, I'M GONNA BE YOUR DRAG-MAMA. YAY! DO YOU WANT TO BE A MALE OR A FEMALE? DEFINITELY A MALE. OKAY, GOT IT. DEFINITELY MALE. DON'T GET ME WRONG THOUGH. 'CAUSE I'M THE WOMAN IN THIS RELATIONSHIP. EXACTLY. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT, LIKE, DANCING AND STUFF LIKE THAT? SO, I'M REALLY... I DANCE LIKE A STRAIGHT, WHITE DUDE NOW. YEAH. I HAVE NO RHYTHM WHATSOEVER. NO, THE NIGHT OF MY ACCIDENT, I WAS WEARING MY COWBOY BOOTS. OH, WHERE ARE THEY? WELL, THEY'RE STILL IN THE CLOSET. I HAVEN'T MADE IT -- I HAVEN'T GRADUATED TO COWBOY BOOTS YET BECAUSE, WELL, IT'S A DIFFERENT FEEL TO WALK. RIGHT, YOU GOT THE HEEL, AND I ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE A ZIPPER PUT IN SO THAT WE CAN GET IT ON THE PROSTHETIC FOOT. OH, YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO, LIKE, BEND YOUR FOOT TO GET INTO A BOOT. YEAH. IT IS A GOAL OF MINE. WE'RE GONNA GET A ZIPPER ON YOUR BOOTS. NICE, LET'S DO IT. WE'RE GONNA FIGURE IT OUT. WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU A BAD ASS. COOL! FOR SURE. WELL, 'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD BE. YOU ARE A GUY, YEAH, YEAH. I MEAN, YOU KNOW. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU. WE HAVE A LOT OF COSTUMES, TEAMS TO GET TOGETHER. YES, AND YOU NEED TO FIND SOMEBODY TO PUT SOME ZIPPERS IN. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST TIME LYNN HAS DANCED, PROBABLY, SINCE HER ACCIDENT, SO WE REALLY GOT TO PUSH HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE CAN DO IT AND THAT I'M HERE WITH HER AND I'M NOT GONNA LET ANYTHING HAPPEN. IF I CAN GET LYNN LINE DANCING AND GETTING DOWN, THE CROWD IS GONNA LOSE THEIR FUCKING MIND! SO, WELCOME TO THE CAMP. THE CAMP. YES. THIS IS WHERE US QUEENS DO ALL OF OUR GLAMOFYING AND, YOU KNOW, DRAGGERY AND, YOU KNOW, GAY SHIT. WELCOME TO MY HOME. THE DIVA! THE DIVA! THIS IS A VERY EXTRA GAY SPACE. DID YOU MAKE ANY OF THESE? OH, CHILD, NO. IF I MADE IT, IT'D BE FALLING ON THE GROUND APART. YOU KNOW, I HAVE YOU AS MY DAUGHTER, OF COURSE, TA-DA, LOOK. YAY. YAY. BUT I WANTED TO INVITE JAMARIO TO ALSO BE INVOLVED IN THE NUMBER WITH US. WOULD THAT BE FINE? AS LONG AS HE'S OKAY WITH IT. THAT INCLUDES YOU GETTING IN DRAG TOO. I'M OKAY WITH IT. YAY! OKAY. AND I'M TAKING ON EVERYTHING FROM HIPS TO TITS TO WIGS. WE'RE GONNA GO FULL ON. THE STORY IS ABOUT EMPOWERMENT AND CELEBRATING YOUR LIFE, AND I DON'T THINK THAT JOSE WOULD FULLY BE CELEBRATING HIS LIFE AS A GAY PERSON WITHOUT JAMARIO IN IT. SO, ARE YOU READY? YES. I FEEL READY. I'M SORRY, ARE YOU READY? I'M READY, YES. HE'S LIKE, I'M READY? ARE YOU READY? I'M SORRY? I'M READY! I WANT TO HEAR AN ECHO. I'M READY! I'M READY! OKAY, SHE'S READY, SHE LIVES. COME ON IN, THIS IS OUR WORK SPACE. MAKEUP MIRRORS. MOM WOULD BE SO HAPPY. OH, 'CAUSE YOU'RE IN FRONT OF A MAKEUP MIRROR? EXACTLY. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS ONE OF YOUR BEST FEATURES THAT YOU LIKE TO SHOWCASE ON STAGE? I LIKE MY CHEST AND MY LEGS. CHEST AND LEGS, OKAY, SO SHE WANTS TO BE NAKED. WHAT ABOUT YOU? ASS. I AM SO EXCITED. I'M EXCITED TOO, AND HONESTLY, I'VE NEVER DONE, LIKE, THIS TYPE OF TRANSFORMATION BEFORE. I DON'T KNOW THE MOST ABOUT BEING A DRAG KING. I MEAN, I CAN TEACH LYNN HOW TO DO DRAG, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TEACH LYNN HOW TO BE A MAN. SO, I DEFINITELY NEED TO PULL IN SOMEBODY TO HELP US WITH THIS. I BROUGHT IN LANDON CIDER WHO IS, LIKE, A PROFESSIONAL DRAG KING. HI! NICE TO MEET YOU. HI, HOW ARE YOU? NICE TO MEET YOU! SHOW HIM YOUR SHIMMY. SHOW US YOUR SHIMMY. I DON'T HAVE A SHIMMY YET. A SHIMMY, YES, COME ON, GIVE US -- THIS IS THE SHIMMY. SHIMMY. YES! FOR THIS HERO VERSION OF A FIRE MARSHAL DRAG QUEEN, I AM THINKING THAT WE DO SOME KIND OF INTERPRETIVE GAS MASK THAT CAN THEN REVEAL THAT YOU HAVE A FULL BEARD UNDERNEATH ALL OF IT TOO. COOL, COOL. I LOVE YOUR RESPONSE. I MEAN, IF I LOOK LIKE THAT, THEN I'M DOWN. THE NUMBER IS GONNA HAVE THAT GREAT MEXICAN LAYER TO IT AND EXCITEMENT. RIGHT. I WAS THINKING, LIKE A FULL SENORITA MEXICO FANTASY. SEE, WE'RE GOING, LIKE, VERY COUNTRY BUT A LITTLE -- OH, I LOVE IT, YES. YOU'RE STILL A LITTLE GAY. SO WHAT IS THE CLIMATE LIKE FOR GAYS IN MEXICAN CULTURE? I THINK IT'S A LOT OF, LIKE, THESE ASSUMPTIONS. DRAG QUEENS ARE PERVERTS AND THEY'RE THIS AND THEY'RE THAT. YEAH. JUST BAD PEOPLE AND PEOPLE YOU CAN'T TRUST. WHEN I FIRST CAME OUT TO MY MOTHER, A LOT OF TEARS, RIGHT? "I'M SURE IT'S JUST A PHASE." AND YOU'RE LIKE, "NO, MOM, VERY GAY. STAYING GAY. FOREVER GAY." WELL, I THINK THE MORE THAT PEOPLE KNOW SOMEONE, AN ACTUAL PERSON AS OPPOSED TO JUST AN IDEA OF WHAT A GAY PERSON, OR A DRAG QUEEN IS, MAYBE WILL HELP BREAK DOWN WHAT THAT STEREOTYPE IS. I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE ENERGY THAT DRAG QUEENS BRING TO THE STAGE WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO BRING THE HOUSE DOWN. SO THERE'S THIS LEGENDARY QUEEN WHO PERFORMED THE SAME SONG THAT YOU'RE PERFORMING. TANDI IMAN DUPREE, THIS IS THE ENTRANCE, GET READY. BAM! IT'S GONNA BE HARD! SO J.LO, WHEN SHE GETS THAT HAIR IN HER FACE, SHE TOSSES IT BACK OUT. SO, YOU JUST. LET'S SAY YOU'RE DOING YOUR NUMBER AND THIS HAPPENS, WHAT YOU GONNA DO? YES, YES. I AM A WOMAN, AND I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I'M A WOMAN. GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY FACE, BITCH! YES, OH! CONFIDENCE IS KEY. THAT KIND OF LIKE, "HEY, LADIES, WHAT'S UP?" YOU KNOW, KIND OF, WHAT SWAGGER. YOU CAN DO SOME HIP THRUSTS. SO THERE'S, YEAH. HYPER MASCULINITY VERSION OF YOURSELF IS GONNA BE SO FUN TO WATCH. WHAT ARE YOUR INITIAL THOUGHTS? LIKE, THIS IS A LOT. I MEAN, THE TRANSFORMATION'S GONNA BE, YOU KNOW, HUGE! I DON'T THINK STACY UNDERSTANDS THE GRAVITY OF WHAT IT IS WE'RE DOING. ALLY VOICES ARE AS STRONG AS QUEER VOICES THEMSELVES. IT'S A HUGE DEAL WHEN THAT PERSON WHO EVERYBODY HAS LOOKED UP TO IS STANDING UP FOR A GAY COMMUNITY. WE GONNA LOOK LIKE THREE SISTERS. THEY GONNA THINK WE DREAM GIRLS. YES. OH, I'M DEENA. OKAY. IN THE BEGINNING, I WOULD WAKE UP MANY MORNINGS FORGETTING THAT I WAS AN AMPUTEE AND, YOU KNOW, THEN HAVE THAT REALIZATION. IT'S NOT A DREAM, IT'S REAL. COME ON, LULU, YOU WANT TO GO OUT? LET'S GO OUTSIDE. AFTER MY ACCIDENT, I WAS AT THE REHAB. THE EMTS ARE PUSHING ME ON THE STRETCHER, AND I LOOKED WAY DOWN THE HALL, AND THERE WAS A PERSON STANDING THERE WITH A LIGHT AROUND HER. AND I CAN'T TELL YOU, IT WAS NOT A LIGHT SOURCE LIKE YOU WOULD EXPECT, BUT SHE WAS ILLUMINATED. LOVE YOU, BABY. AND I REMEMBER LOOKING AT HER AND SAYING, "WOW, WHO IS THAT?" I DON'T KNOW AT THE TIME WHAT I WAS THINKING BECAUSE, WHO'S LOOKING FOR THEIR LIFE MATE IN THE MIDDLE OF, YOU KNOW, THIS TYPE OF SITUATION? I REMEMBER JUST LOOKING AT HER AND NOT REALLY KNOWING FOR SURE IF SHE WAS EVEN SOMEBODY THAT DATED WOMEN. ARE YOU SEATED? I THINK I AM. HAVE TO WALK FIRST. I WAS ACTUALLY TOLD, YOU'LL PROBABLY NEVER WALK AGAIN. GET YOUR HOUSE WHEELCHAIR READY. DO MY TEST WALK. AND I REMEMBER, ROSE WAS JUST LIKE, "THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE." AND SHE'S LIKE, "PUT THE LEG ON. LET'S GO." WANT TO CHECK THAT STRAP? YEAH. COULD BE A LITTLE BIT -- IT'S A LITTLE SNUG. IS IT SNUG? OR TOO MUCH? NO, IT'S GOOD, I THINK. OH, IT'S RELEASING TOO. YEAH, JUST TIGHTEN IT JUST A TAD BIT SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO WORK SO HARD TO OPEN. ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY THAT. HOLD UP. STRAIGHTEN YOUR ARM OUT. SEE? THAT'S GOOD. ALL RIGHT? THE THING THAT I KNOW FOR SURE, SHE'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME. LYNN, DO Y'ALL KNOW EACH OTHER? I DON'T, I DON'T. NO, NO. STACY WAS A FIREFIGHTER FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS. YEAH, I REMEMBER YOUR INCIDENT, YEAH, YEAH. OH, REALLY? NO KIDDING, OKAY. YOU WERE ON THE SCENE OR -- YOU LEFT, YOU LEFT. YOU WERE GETTING IN THE HELICOPTER BY THE TIME I WAS THERE, YEAH. YOU WERE THERE, YEAH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU DID, YEAH. OH, ANY TIME, ANY TIME. HOW ARE YOU? STACY. I'M SHANGELA, NICE TO MEET YOU, STACY. LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIENDS. THIS IS MARIO. WE GREW UP TOGETHER. I THINK WE GREW UP TOGETHER, YEAH, YEAH. I LOVE THAT. AND JOSE. OH, Y'ALL ALREADY KNOW EACH OTHER? OH, MY CHILD. DRAG MAMA! I AM SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. HI, BABY, HOW YOU DOING? YOUR HANDS ARE COLD. HI, BEAUTIFUL. HOW ARE YOU GUYS FEELING ABOUT THE SHOW THAT'S COMING UP? I'VE HEARD WE HAVE BEEN THE HOT TOPIC ON RUSTON RANTS. WHAT IS THAT? WAIT, WHAT'S RUSTON RANTS? ON FACEBOOK. IT'S A GOSSIPING LITTLE -- YEAH, IT'S FOR VERY NARROW MINDED PEOPLE. SO YOU THINK VERY HIGHLY OF IT. I SEE YOU'RE A BIG FAN, ROSE. I GOT KICKED OFF, SO. 20,000 MEMBERS OF RUSTON RANTS! THAT'S THE WHOLE TOWN, YEAH. THE PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT WHO WOULDN'T BE SUPPORTIVE, THEY'RE LIKE, LET 'EM DO WHATEVER THEM DOING. THE FOLKS WILL BE, LIKE, "I LOVE YOU " OR LIKE, " THAT'S NOT A CHRISTIAN THING TO DO." SO IT'S BEEN... THEY'RE THE ONES LIKE WRITING CITY HALL, BEING LIKE, "THE GAYS ARE TAKING OVER." BUT THEY SAY THESE THINGS WHEN THEY ARE BEHIND THEIR KEYBOARD. THEY DON'T SAY IT OUT -- IF YOU MET 'EM OUT IN PUBLIC? YEAH, THEY WOULDN'T SAY THAT. NO, THEY GONNA RUN. 'CAUSE I'VE HAD INTERACTIONS WHERE THEY TAKE OFF RUNNING. SO, DO YOU FEEL LIKE HAVING THIS EVENT, THEN, ON TUESDAY NIGHT, DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE A MARK ON RUSTON, IT'S GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS TOWN, YOU THINK? I THINK FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEVER PARTICIPATED IN BEING INVOLVED IN THAT ARE GONNA BE LIKE, WOW, THIS IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT. SO DON'T FORGET, GUYS, WE ALSO HAVE REHEARSAL TOMORROW. REHEARSAL TOMORROW. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY WHO MAY NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE BEING AS OUT, LOUD, AND PROUD OR BEING AN ALLY LIKE YOU GUYS ARE ON THAT STAGE AND IF YOU GIVE THEM THE AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE AND YOU GIVE THEM THE PRIDE THAT YOU GUYS HAVE, THEN IT'S GONNA REALLY HELP SOMEBODY OUT, AND THAT'S REALLY WHY WE'RE HERE. WE'RE GONNA GET, RUSTON'S GOT SOMETHING TO RANT ABOUT. HEY! HEY, HEY, YOU GUYS, LISTEN. THERE'S A MARDI GRAS FESTIVAL, WE SHOULD GO. WORK. DO THEY HAVE, LIKE, CERTAIN BARBECUES AND STUFF LIKE THAT?

NAOMI CAMPBELL, SET, GO. COME ON, BABY. I'M GONNA FALL. YOU ARE NOT GONNA FALL. KEEP YOUR STATURE, YOUR POSTURE IS UP, YOUR HEAD IS UP LIKE A BOOK IS ON TOP AND YOU GONNA HIT THAT SIDE CORNER. YOU READY? FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT AND WALK. I'M GETTING A LITTLE NERVOUS WITH YOU IN THIS SHOE. FOR DANCING AND FOR ALL THAT WE HAVE TO DO. SO LET'S TRY ON A BOOT, OKAY? NOW, THAT'S A SICKENING BOOT. CAT WALK ACROSS THE STAGE. HANDS ON MY HIPS. THERE YOU GO, YEAH, YES! YES! PUT YOUR HEAD UP! THERE YOU GO. LESSON ON THE CHOREO, OKAY? YEAH, I FORGOT. SO I'M GONNA NEED THE MUSIC AND A COCKTAIL, GOOD LORD. TAP, TAP, UP AND CLAP. YEAH, YEAH. STEP, TOUCH, STEP, TOUCH, STEP, TOUCH. OH, FRONT AND BACK, YEAH. YEAH, OH, YEAH. FRONT AND BACK. THERE YOU GO. OH, YOU GOT IT. YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. WHY ARE YOU PRETENDING? SOMETIMES DRAG IS BIG. 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO SEE IT ON THE BACK ROW! NOT HERE. OH, EXTEND ALL THE WAY. EXTEND. SO, IF YOU FORGET YOUR WORDS, YOU JUST START SAYING WATERMELON MOTHERFUCKER, AND FOR SOME REASON. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU MIGHT NO A WORD OR TWO. FANTASTIC! WATERMELON MOTHERFUCKER! FOR SURE. I AM A LADY, HA! I AM SELENA. OOH. WHAT IS... OOH. HELP ME, JESUS. IT'S JUST A TURN. WHAT YOU ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER TOO, LET ME TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, THIS PERFORMANCE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING, GOES BEYOND IF YOU TURN AND STEP ON THE RIGHT FOOT AT THE RIGHT TIME. RIGHT. I'M GONNA NEED HIM TO, LIKE, LIVEN UP, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OTHER PEOPLE SEE WHAT STACY'S DOING AND THAT HE DO IT UNABASHEDLY. IT IS PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER. THAT'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO. I'M GONNA TELL YOU NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME YOU'LL BE UP IN THE MORNING, BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS MEMORIZED TONIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO BED. WE'RE NOT GOING TO SLEEP TONIGHT, BITCH. I KNOW. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS FOR JOSE. THE SHOW IS UPON US, OKAY? NO, I MEAN, I LOOK FORWARD TO IT. I WISH WE KIND OF HAD LIKE A TELEPROMPT. TELEPROMPTER! LISTEN, WE'LL DO WHAT WE GOT TO DO TO GET WHERE WE GOT TO GET, OKAY? HOW OFTEN DO YOU COME OVER HERE? ONCE OR TWICE A MONTH. OKAY. BUT YOU LIVE IN THIS TOWN TOO. SO IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU AND YOUR MOM HAVE A SOMEWHAT OF A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP? YEAH. DO YOU LOVE HER? YES. HER, BRINGING US HERE AND TAKING ME AWAY FROM HOW BAD MY LIFE WAS BACK IN MEXICO, I'M JUST GRATEFUL FOR THAT. I LIVED WITH HER TILL I WAS ALMOST 19. OKAY. AND THAT'S IT, AND THEN I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN SINCE THEN. WHY DID YOU MOVE OUT? WE HAD A FALL-OUT. I TOLD HER I WAS GONNA GO SEE A GUY THAT I WANTED TO DATE AND SHE WAS LIKE, IF YOU GO OUT AND SEE HIM, DON'T COME BACK. YOU KNOW? DID YOU GUYS EVER, LIKE, HAVE THAT TALK WHERE YOU WERE, LIKE, "MOM, I WANT YOU TO HEAR ME, THIS IS HOW I FELT AS A KID." NO. TO THIS DAY, NOW WE ALWAYS TRY TO NOT TALK ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT. AND WHENEVER I DO TRY AND TALK ABOUT IT OR ANYBODY TRIES TO TALK ABOUT IT, IT JUST GETS SHUT DOWN BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO COPE WITH IT. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THINGS GET BOTTLED UP AND IGNORED. THEY JUST SIT THERE AND THEY EAT AWAY AT YOU. HELLO! HI. HOW YOU DOING? HI! I'M DJ, OR SHANGELA. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. MY NAME IS ROSIO. ROSIO. I LOVE IT. BEAUTIFUL. NICE TO MEET YOU, ROSIO. A PLEASURE. ARE YOU MAKING ME SOME CEREAL? YEAH. YEAH, I WANT A BOWL OF CEREAL, MAMA! EVERY MORNING, WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID, MY GRANDMA, SHE WOULD GIVE ME A BOWL OF FROSTY FLAKES AND THAT'S WHAT I'D EAT, AND SHE WOULD DUMP SUGAR ON IT THOUGH. OH. I DIDN'T HAVE NO TEETH. I HAD TO GET 'EM ALL NEW. HOW WAS JOSE GROWING UP? AS A NIÑO, AS A KID? HE WAS A GOOD BOY, JUST WHEN HE LITTLE. WHEN HE IS MOVING HERE IS A LOT FOR HIM, FOR CHANGE EVERYTHING AND THIS IS CONFUSED, NO ENGLISH, NOTHING, GOING TO SCHOOLING HERE IN SIXTH GRADE. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE. I STARTED SCHOOL WITH NO ENGLISH. YEAH, NOTHING. WERE YOU MORE QUIET IN SCHOOL? OH, YEAH. ONE YEAR HE HAS TO SPEAK ENGLISH. ONE YEAR ONLY? IN ONE YEAR ONLY. THIS IS COMING TO HIM 'CAUSE HE'S GONE TO SCHOOL, IN THE SCHOOL. NEVER COMPLAIN IN THE SCHOOL. AND THEN IN THE SCHOOL, SOMEBODY PUSH ON HIM AND -- BULLYING. BULLYING. UH-HUH, THE BULLYING ON THE SCHOOL. HE HAS NOT TOLD ME, BUT I... HE'S TOLD TO ME EVERYTHING. WHY DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU WOULDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING HOME AND TELLING YOUR MOM? I THINK SHE'S MORE WORRIED ABOUT, LIKE, WHAT THEY WILL SAY ABOUT HER AND THE FAMILY AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT THEY WILL THINK ABOUT HER, STUFF LIKE THAT. SO I JUST DON'T TELL HER. NO, YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU 12 YEARS OLD? WHEN YOU 12 YEARS? WHEN I TALK TO YOU. YOU REMEMBER? NO, NO. I'M YOUR MOTHER. WHEN YOU -- IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY. DO YOU HEAR HER? THIS IS FOR REAL. THIS IS REAL. REAL. REAL. AND ALL THE TIME, ALL THE TIME, I'M SUPPORTING YOU. ALL RIGHT, SO I HAVE MORE OF A, "DON'T DO IT BECAUSE YOU GONNA BRING ATTENTION TO YOURSELF." AND SHE DOESN'T, SHE DIDN'T WANT THAT. INSTEAD OF BEING, LIKE, "DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, JUST DO IT" SHE SUPPRESSED IT. WE'RE DOING A SHOW TOGETHER. WHAT WILL IT MEAN TO YOU WHEN YOU SEE YOUR MOM AND YOUR SISTER IN THE AUDIENCE? THAT I CAN COUNT ON THEM. THEN MAYBE EVERYTHING THAT I'VE THOUGHT, THAT THEY DID WRONG OR THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS WRONG, THAT I WASN'T RIGHT, YOU KNOW? HOW WILL IT MAKE YOU FEEL TO SEE HIM ON STAGE? I LOVE THIS. WELL, THANK YOU. CAN ONLY DRAG PEOPLE WALK ON STAGE? BABY, YOU WANT TO COME UP ON THE STAGE? YOU MAKE SURE AND THANK YOUR SISTER. THANK YOUR SISTER AND TAKE HER TO THE SHOW. I KNEW IT. WE WILL SEE YOU AT THE SHOW. YES, IT IS. OKAY, PLEASE INVITE YOUR FRIENDS. OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH. I LOVE IT. OKAY, WE'LL SEE YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. TUESDAY, TUESDAY NIGHT. TUESDAY NIGHT. OKAY. REMEMBER, MOTHERS ARE ALWAYS GONNA PUT ON THE BEST FACE AMONGST FRIENDS. AMONG STRANGERS. UH-HUH. THEY'RE ALWAYS GONNA DO THAT. DID YOU FEEL LIKE THAT? I DIDN'T FEEL IT, I SAW IT. IT'S JUST, I DON'T WANT TO HURT THEM, SO IT JUST, WHATEVER FACE SHE GIVES ME, THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME RIGHT NOW. RIGHT. AND SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'LL TAKE RIGHT NOW. DOING DRAG IS NOT ABOUT WANTING TO DRESS OR BE A GIRL, IT'S ABOUT SHOWING MY FAMILY THAT I CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF AND BE MORE THAN THEY THINK I AM. IF THEY WERE THERE, I WOULDN'T CARE IF THEY WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE. I JUST DON'T WANT MORE REJECTION. LOOK STRAIGHT AT ME. OH, WHO IS SHE? HAVE YOU EVER SEEN JAMARIO WITHOUT HIS MUSTACHE? NO. IT'S A PART OF WHO I AM. YEAH, HE ALWAYS HAD IT. IT'S GONE. NOW I LOOK LIKE A LITTLE CUTIE LIKE YOU. TAKE A SHOT BEFORE YOU GO ON STAGE, SETTLE THE NERVES. WELL, I AM BETTER AT DANCING WHEN I'M DRUNK. YOU EVER BEEN DRUNK IN HIGH HEELS THOUGH? MM-MM, MM-MM, I CAN'T SAY I HAVE. I THINK EVERYONE'S SURPRISED BY WHAT THEY FIND WHEN THEY GET IN DRAG FOR THE FIRST TIME. LIKE, YOU FIND SOMETHING IN YOU THAT WAS NEVER BEFORE AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, THIS IS BRAND THE FUCK NEW." HOW YOU DOING WITH YOUR LINES? YOU GOOD? GOOD, YES. YOU FEEL GOOD? OKAY, TELL ME, WHAT'S THE FIRST WORDS OF J.LO? OOH, WHO? HEY, SIR, YOU WANT A DATE? I COULD GO TAKE YOU OUT DANCING. AH! THIS WAS SO CONVINCING WHEN I WALKED INTO THE BATHROOM, I TRIED TO PEE STANDING UP. RUSTON, LOUISIANA, ARE YOU READY FOR A GOOD TIME? PLEASE WELCOME THE ONE AND ONLY MISS BOB THE DRAG QUEEN! RUSTON, HOW YOU FEELING? SOMEBODY TAKE MY BABY, I GOT TO... YOU KNOW, THEY JUST LATCH ON. THERE WE GO. CAN WE HAVE A BIG, BIG, BIG THANK YOU AND BIG SHOUT OUT TO SUNDOWN FOR ALLOWING US TO HAVE A -- YES, WE SAID, WHERE IS THERE A SAFE SPACE FOR QUEERS TO GO AND DRINK AND PARTY AND COMMUNE AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN, PEOPLE SAID "GO TO THE SUNDOWN TAVERN."

THESE ARE YOUR BROTHERS, YOUR SISTERS, YOUR SIBLINGS, YOUR PARENTS, YOUR NEIGHBORS, YOUR CHILDREN, YOUR GRANDCHILDREN, YOUR COUSINS. SO, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, ARE YOU READY FOR AN AMAZING DRAG SHOW? YEAH! FOR ME, THE BIGGEST THING IS THAT I'M A LESBIAN AND I'M A DOUBLE AMPUTEE AND I JUST WANT TO BE ACCEPTED FOR BEING JUST THE WAY I AM. THREE YEARS AGO, I WAS HIT BY A DUMB MOTHERFUCKER AND LOST MY ARM AND LEG. MY NAME IS WILL-LYNN O'HARA AND THIS IS MY DRAG-MAMA, EUREKA. WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK OF THIS FUCKIN' STUD, WILL-LYNN O'HARA!? WE ALSO GOT THE WIFE IN THE HOUSE, MISS ROSE. MISS ROSE, GET UP HERE. SO THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL, OPEN, LESBIAN COUPLE RIGHT HERE IN TOWN. I JUST WANT TO SAY, THESE ARE THE EXACT BOOTS THAT I WAS KNOCKED OUT OF THE NIGHT THAT I WAS HIT ON MY MOTORCYCLE. PUTTING THEM BACK ON THIS MORNING, FELT LIKE COMING HOME. DO YOU HAVE ANY RESERVATIONS? NO, I MEAN, I AM NERVOUS, BUT I MEAN, IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT REALLY DOES MEAN A LOT, I THINK, TO ALL OF US, TO HAVE YOU HERE. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INCLUSIVE. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AN ALLY. IF ANYBODY EVER BEING MISTREATED, I'LL ALWAYS STEP IN. IT DON'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE. SO COMING TO THE STAGE RIGHT NOW, I WANT TO INVITE MY GOOD... WHAT? WE DON'T WANT NO GAYS! WHAT? I'M SORRY, WHAT? WE DON'T WANT NO DRAG SHOW, NO GAYS! Y'ALL DON'T WANT NO DRAG SHOW? WHAT? WE DON'T WANT NO DRAG SHOW, HEY, HEY! WE DON'T WANT NO DRAG SHOW! GIVE IT UP FOR FIRE MARSHAL STACY. WE ARE TAKING YOU OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE, LITERALLY WITH THIS CORSET. OH, OH. WHAT HAS THIS WEEK BEEN LIKE FOR YOU? IT'S BEEN VERY EYE-OPENING. I MEAN, IF IT TAKES THIS MUCH JUST TO FEEL YOURSELF, THEN I -- I HATE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPRESSED AND DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY CAN BE THEIRSELVES. I APPRECIATE YOU SO MUCH BEING A PART OF THIS. HOW MUCH OF A BIG BROTHER YOU'VE BEEN. I AM PROUD OF YOU, MAN. STANDING UP FOR HIMSELF MORE. I'M TRYING NOT TO CRY. YOUR MOM, HAS SHE ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTIVE? HER UNDERSTANDING, IT'S KIND OF LIKE DIFFICULT, I GUESS. SHE SEES IT HER WAY AND THEN I SEE IT MY WAY AND THEN WE DON'T MEET IN THE MIDDLE MOST OF THE TIME, SO I'M VERY NERVOUS. I WANT TO PLEASE GET A HUGE ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR KIWI-LICIOUS, BIG MAMA BUTTER, AND SHANGELA LAQUIFA WADLEY! NO, EVERYBODY'S GONNA LAUGH. FRIEND, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT OTHERS THINK OF YOU. BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND I WILL ALWAYS BE YOUR FRIEND. SOMEONE'S COMING. I THINK IT'S YOUR NOSY NEIGHBOR. NEIGHBOR! NEIGHBOR! HELLO. HI, OLD LADY WADLEY. WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? OH, THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD WILL BE TALKING. ARE YOU A DRAG QUEEN? NO. I MEAN, YES, I AM A DRAG QUEEN, AND I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK. IT'S TIME I START CELEBRATING BEING ME. HIT IT! I KNOW Y'ALL NOT GONNA HAVE THIS PARTY WITHOUT ME, HONEY. COME ON. TONIGHT, I THANK YOU BOTH BECAUSE YOU WERE OPEN TO SOMETHING THAT YOU WERE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH AT FIRST, BUT YOU GREW. LIVING IN A TOWN LIKE THIS, NOT REALLY KNOWING HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO SUPPORT YOU, THIS IS HISTORY RIGHT HERE. I AM VERY, VERY HAPPY. MY FAMILY IS RIGHT HERE, MY MOTHER. GOOD JOB! THANK YOU FOR PUSHING ME SO HARD. SIS, YOU PULLED OUT SOME STUFF I HADN'T EVEN SEEN YET. I WAS LIKE, OKAY THEN, MISS THING! WHOO! I'M DEFINITELY A NEW PERSON. IT FELT GOOD, IT FELT RIGHT. WHEN I PUT ON FULL COSTUME, I WAS ABLE TO RELATE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHAT DRAG MEANS TO MANY PEOPLE. IT WAS LIKE, WOW, YOU CAN SEE THEIR AUTHENTIC SELVES. I'M SO FUCKIN' PROUD OF YOU. OH, MY GOD, THAT WAS AMAZING. THERE WAS A PART OF ME THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS BECAUSE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WEREN'T REAL HAPPY THAT WE WERE DOING THIS. BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE HERE ARE VERY ACCEPTANT OF ALL LIFESTYLES. THAT'S WHAT I SAW TONIGHT. HEY, KIDS, DON'T FORGET, THIS IS NOW A SAFE SPACE HERE AT THE SUNDOWN. BIG SHOUT OUT TO ALL THE DRAG QUEENS AND THE NON-BINARY PEOPLE, THE QUEERS WHO CAME OUT HERE TO CELEBRATE TONIGHT. THIS IS A PLACE WHERE I CAN BE MYSELF WITH MY LOVED ONES, WITH MY FAMILY, WITH MY PARTNERS AND YOURSELVES, THE COMMUNITY. YES! WE ARE HERE! WE ARE HERE! THANK YOU SO MUCH, RUSTON, YOU'VE BEEN AMAZING! Sound is speeding! I'ma do a clap slay! Me, Bob, and Shangela have been through a lot of things to get where we are. And we hope that you all enjoy exploring just a part of our stories. I used to try on towels, on my hair, you know, as wigs, and tip around in my mom's heels when she wasn't looking. Being a gay kid in a small town, it was hard. I always liked dressing up, since I could remember, but I was just really terrified to do it. I kept thinking, I'm broken. Like just didn't wanna deal with being myself. Drag saved my life, I don't know what I would do if I didn't have this. During this lockdown, you might feel like you're alone, but this is a thing that we're all in together. Work.
