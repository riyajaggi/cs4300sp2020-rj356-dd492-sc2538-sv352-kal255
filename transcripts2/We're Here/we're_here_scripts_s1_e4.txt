 You know it's been 15 years? You remembered everything. First train after five. Oh my god. - What will I say? - To who? This is unforgivable. I have a life, with consequences! I want you to choose me. I'm not the same person I used to be. You want to go home, I'll understand. I don't wanna end here. Run.

 EVERYTHING IS TAN. JUST LOTS OF SHADES OF TAN. IT'S LIKE A KAYNE WEST FASHION SHOW. THE ENERGY I GET HERE IS KIND OF UPTIGHT, NOT REALLY A LET LOOSE TYPE OF PLACE. SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN SHOW FARMINGTON WHAT FUN LOOKS LIKE. HERE WE GO, HONEY. HI, WELCOME TO THE MONSTER TRUCK RALLY. WHOA! EUREKA, WOULD YOU LIKE A FLAG? OH, I'M A FLAG GIRL. FARMINGTON REMINDS ME OF THE MOUNTAINOUS AREAS I COME FROM. THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME COUNTRY ROOTS HERE. HI, FARMINGTON. WE'RE HERE. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL! OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU SO RIGHT. YOU ARE SO CORRECT. THERE'S A LARGE INDIGENOUS POPULATION HERE IN FARMINGTON. IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO SHIPROCK, WHICH IS ON THE NAVAJO RESERVATION. HI, BABES. WHEN YOU DON'T LIVE NEAR A RESERVATION, YOU JUST DON'T SEE THIS MANY INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. BACK UP. YOUR TAIL GOT HOOKED. OH. I GOT YOU, GAL. THANK YOU. OH GOD, OH GOD! THESE ARE REALLY MOVING! OH, MY GOD! EUREKA! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! I'M GOOD. I'D LIKE TO GET UP. KNOCK KNOCK. HI. HI. OH MY GOODNESS. Y'ALL LOOK SO CUTE. HI, I'M EUREKA. JASMINE, HOW ARE YOU? OH, JASMINE, YOU'RE SO PRETTY. THANK YOU. MOM, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? STACEY. STACEY, I'M EUREKA. OR MOM. OR MOM. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL ME. WELL YOU CAN CALL ME DAD THEN. I'M KIDDING. I'M NOW THE BABY? CAN I SIT WITH YOU? OF COURSE. WORK. WHERE WE AT? WHAT IS THIS PLACE? IT'S OUR FAMILY CAR LOT. WE OWN THE CAR LOT, A USED CAR LOT. Y'ALL OWN THIS PLACE? WORK. BUSINESSWOMEN. I LOVE THAT. I LOVE THAT. SEEMS KIND OF LIKE A SMALL TOWN HERE. WOULD Y'ALL CALL THIS A SMALL TOWN? OH YEAH, VERY SMALL. IT'S GOTTEN BIGGER BUT IT'S STILL A SMALL TOWN VIBE. WORK, WORK, WORK. SO, WHY Y'ALL DOING THIS? I'M CURIOUS. MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS A LESBIAN AT 25 DECIDED TO PUT A GUN TO HER HEAD AND KILL HERSELF. I HAVE DJ TATTOOED ON MY ARM. THIS IS YOUR SISTER? YEAH? SHE'S GORGEOUS. YEAH. SHE WAS. WOW. WHAT HAPPENED? DO YOU MIND IF I ASK? I'M JUST CURIOUS. SHE'D HAD A COCKTAIL OF THINGS GOING ON. NOT ONLY WAS SHE GAY BUT SHE SUFFERED FROM BIPOLAR MANIC-DEPRESSIVE AND I THINK IT WAS A SPIRAL FROM THERE. I CAN'T IMAGINE. I THINK DJ JUST STRUGGLED WITH THE FACT THAT SHE FELT LIKE SHE HAD THE CHOICE WHEN SHE DIDN'T, YOU KNOW? THAT'S ONE THING I CAN'T STAND IS PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "YOU CHOOSE TO BE GAY." AND WATCHING DJ STRUGGLE WITH THAT, I'M LIKE, I REALLY DON'T THINK SHE WOULD PUT HERSELF THROUGH TURMOIL OF WHO SHE WAS. I LOVE THAT YOU SAID THAT BECAUSE SOCIETY BASICALLY TEACHES YOU YOUR WHOLE LIFE THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WRONG AND IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE THIS WEIGHT IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND. NO MATTER HOW MUCH GOODNESS YOU HAVE AROUND YOU, IT'S STILL THERE, BECAUSE IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT HURT THE MOST. IN FARMINGTON, YOU FEEL JUDGED. I EVEN KNEW IT. I WATCHED MY DAUGHTER GO THROUGH IT AND I'M LIKE HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO MEAN IN THE THINGS THEY SAY OR ACTIONS THAT THEY TAKE TOWARDS SOMEBODY WHO'S JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. EVEN THOUGH I TRIED TO STOP IT FROM HAPPENING, IT STILL HAPPENED TO HER ALL THE TIME. EVERYTHING THAT WE STAND FOR IS BASED ON DJ. SHE WOULD GO HELP A SINGLE MOTHER PUT HER AIR CONDITIONER UP IN THE SUMMER BECAUSE HER HUSBAND WAS DEPLOYED AND THIS WOMAN HAD NOBODY ELSE. SO, THIS IS REAL LIFE STUFF. WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT UNTIL AFTER SHE DIED AND THE LADY SENT ME A MESSAGE. SO GENUINE. YOU DIDN'T KNOW. YOU DIDN'T KNOW. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE SHE WAS SUCH THIS LIGHT AND LIFE THAT WHEN SHE PASSED AWAY IT BECAME A BEACON BECAUSE THERE A SUICIDE EPIDEMIC GOING ON. WE CAN CHANGE. WE CAN USE WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR FAMILY, WHAT HAPPENED TO HER, WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH, AND HELP OTHER PEOPLE. SO, THAT'S OUR MAIN DRIVE. CONGRATULATIONS. I THINK SOUNDS AMAZING. I WANT TO SHOW THAT TO PEOPLE. DJ'S NOT FORGOTTEN AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT'S READ BUT I ALSO WANT PEOPLE TO SEE THAT Y'ALL HAVE BEEN THROUGH A STRUGGLE TOO. FOR ME DOING THIS, THIS IS STEPPING OUT OF A COMFORT ZONE. SOMETHING THAT SHE HAD TO DO EVERY SINGLE DAY. THAT WAS HER EVERY SINGLE DAY LIFE. I WANT TO TRY TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON HOW WE CAN HELP. IT WAS SO NICE TO MEET YOU. YOU TOO. I'M SO EXCITED. I'M MORE EXCITED THAN YOU ARE. I LOVE Y'ALL. BYE. BYE. SEE YOU. SEE YOU. I KNOW THAT AT AN EARLY AGE THAT I WANTED TO BE SOMEONE THAT HELPED PEOPLE. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I WAS GOING TO BE A LAWYER. MORNING, LADIES. GOOD MORNING, NICOLE. WHEN I CAME TO FARMINGTON, I GOT MY FIRST CAREER JOB HERE. I AM AN ATTORNEY. I WORK AT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. SO, THIS IS REALLY STARTING TO FEEL LIKE A PLACE THAT I COULD MAKE MY HOME AND JUST TRY TO MAKE AN IMPACT HERE. BUT, IT WAS KIND OF HARD WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING HERE. I LIKE WEARING MEN'S CLOTHES MORE THAN WEARING WOMEN'S CLOTHES. YOU'RE NOT SURE WHETHER YOU SHOULD BE CORRECTING SOMEONE WHO CALLS YOU MR. HALL OR SAYS, "YES SIR." IT'S BEEN HARD. I WANT TO CREATE SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY, HERE IN FARMINGTON. I JUST WISH THAT IS WAS MORE COMFORTABLE FOR MORE PEOPLE. HELLO. HI. THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION HERE, SO I WANTED TO COME AND CHAT WITH YOU AND HANG OUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE. WE'RE REALLY EXCITED THAT YOU'RE HERE. I AM THE NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF IDENTITY. LGBTQ COMMUNITY CENTER. AS A TEAM AND COMING OUT WE DIDN'T HAVE A GAY YOUTH CENTER IN MY TOWN. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY COOL AT THE TIME. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN SUPER COMFORTABLE GOING THERE YET BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO EVEN KNOW. TO HAVE THAT, RIGHT? RIGHT. WE'D LOVE TO BE OPEN LONGER AND MORE HOURS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT WE HAVE SURVIVED SOLELY ON LGBTQ QUEER PEOPLE. BUT ULTIMATELY, THIS CENTER NEEDS MORE SUPPORT FROM THIS COMMUNITY. YEAH. IN ANY WAY THAT WE CAN GET IT. ANY WAY WE CAN GET IT. AND I'LL TELL YOU, I'M HOPING, PART OF US BEING HERE IS WE WANT TO HELP BUILD THAT COMMUNITY. WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THIS CENTER AND BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER, WE ALSO WANT TO DO THAT. THE BEST WAY WE KNOW TO DO THAT IS PUT A SHOW. I'VE NEVER DONE A SHOW, THOUGH. I'VE NEVER EVER EVEN DONE DRAG. COME STAND UP WITH ME. COME ON. WE'VE GOT TO SEE WHERE AM I WORKING FROM. OKAY, KEEP UP WITH ME. WE AT THE FAMILY BARBECUE. THAT'S THE BEAT. OKAY. AND NOW HUH, OH YOU KICKED IT! OKAY, SO YOU CAN KEEP A RHYTHM. NOW I KNOW WHAT I'M WORKING WITH. I'VE GOT YOU. A LITTLE BIT. SO, WHAT KIND OF DRAG WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE ON STAGE. SO, I LIVE MY LIFE AS A WOMAN BUT I DRESS MORE MASCULINE, EVERY DAY ALL DAY. EVEN AT WORK, I GOT MISGENDERED WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE BY PROFESSIONALS. THAT HAS TO BE A JARRING EXPERIENCE. YEAH, IT WAS REALLY JARRING AND THAT'S A CONSTANT THING. AN EVERYDAY THING IN MY LIFE. LIKE, I WENT TO THE STORE THE OTHER DAY, SHE ASKED FOR MY ID AND I HAVE HER THE ID AND SHE DOES A DOUBLE TAKE. I WAS, "OH I KNOW, I'VE GOT THIS BABY FACE." YEAH,. I'M 33. YEAH. AND SO, SHE'S LIKE, "NO, NO, IT'S JUST YOU LOOK LIKE A MAN ON THIS ID." I WAS LIKE, "OH, IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE I'VE GOT MY SHORT HAIR." BUT HOW -- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I ALSO THINK ABOUT IN ADDITION TO US, OUR TRANS BROTHERS AND SISTERS TOO. SAME THING. THAT IT'S YOUR FULL IDENTITY. YOU WORK SO HARD TO REALIZE, COME IN TO WHO YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THIS WORLD AND WHO YOU WERE BORN TO BE, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO FACE BEING MISGENDERED. RIGHT. I THINK I JUST NEED TO, I DON'T KNOW, LEARN HOW TO RESPOND. I THINK BEING MISGENDERED GREATLY AFFECTS NICOLE. YOU CAN JUST FEEL IT AND WHEN YOU'RE MISGENDERED, IT JUST KNOCKS YOU DOWN. I WANT TO GIVE NICOLE A PERFORMANCE THAT HAS MEANING AS A PROUD OUT LESBIAN PERSON WHO IS A LEADING PERSON IN THIS COMMUNITY, WHO EMBRACES HER FEMININITY BUT STILL HOLDS STRONG TO WHO SHE IS AS A MALE-PRESENTING LESBIAN. RIGHT? AND IT'S GOING TO BE FUN. YOU SURE? NO. IT'S GOING TO BE HORRIBLE. IT'S ME, GIRL. WHEN IT COMES TO SHOW TIME, I'M LIKE YAH! OKAY, COME ON. LET ME GET A COUPLE OF THESE. OH, YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THE FEMALE ONES? WELL YEAH. I'M GOING TO PRACTICE AT HOME. OKAY. SAFE SEX, EVERYBODY. HALLELU. I LIVE ON THE NAVAJO RESERVATION IN SHIPROCK, NEW MEXICO. GROWING UP ON THE RESERVATION I WAS PICKED ON AT SCHOOL. "ARE YOU GAY?" THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD SAY. OR CALLING ME "FAGGOT." I JUST NEVER SAID ANYTHING BECAUSE I WAS SCARED. AS FAR AS THE INDIGENOUS LGBTQ COMMUNITY HERE IN THE NAVAJO NATION, THE COMMUNITIES ARE ENCLOSED, PROTECTING THEMSELVES. AS I GOT OLDER, I STARTED TO IDENTIFY WHO I AM AND WHERE I CAME FROM AS AN INDIGENOUS GAY MALE. I WANT TO KNOW MY LANGUAGE MORE. I WANT TO SAY THINGS. SOMETIMES I'M SCARED BUT SEEING THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY, I FEEL LIKE THAT'S IMPORTANT AS A NAVAJO, AS A DINE. OKAY, I LOVE THIS LOOK. DINE IS THE PREFERRED TERM FOR THE PEOPLE IN NAVAJO AND I'M STILL LEARNING ABOUT MY TRIBE TODAY. THANK YOU. ARE THERE LIKE A LOT OF QUEER PEOPLE AROUND? DISCREETLY. DISCREETLY. WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT. I THINK WE'RE REALLY LUCKY THAT WE FOUND EACH OTHER, ACTUALLY, 'CAUSE THERE ARE SOME POINTS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY WHERE YOU'RE DEFINITELY PUSHED ASIDE AND OSTRACIZED. YEAH, WE ALL GOT CONNECTED THROUGH OUR ART. HE DOES CLOTHES. HE DOES PHOTOGRAPHY. I DO DRAG. OH WORK. THAT'S AMAZING. THEY WOULD PERFORM AND THEN I WOULD TAKE PHOTOS AND THAT'S HOW I DEVELOPED MY ART AS A PHOTOGRAPHER, SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY. I LOVE WHAT I DO AND SOMETIMES IT TAKES SACRIFICES. BEING WHO I AM, RIGHT NOW, EVEN BEFORE I CAME OUT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS BAD ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE. YES. IN OUR CULTURE, US AS QUEER FOLKS ARE VERY SACRED HUMAN BEINGS. THEY'VE FORGOT. AND BECAUSE OF RELIGION, THEY FORGOT THAT. YOU FIND OUT THAT QUEER PEOPLE, IN OUR STORIES, SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME THEY'VE BEEN INTEGRAL. VERY, VERY INTEGRAL. CEREMONIOUSLY IN THE HOUSEHOLD, GENDER WASN'T A THING. BUT BECAUSE OF RELIGION WE WERE SHUNNED OUT AND PUSHED AWAY. I DID NOT KNOW THAT. THAT IS WILD. THAT IS REALLY, REALLY WILD. SO, I REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT DRAG. HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE? NO. DO YOU HAVE A PERFORMANCE HISTORY OF DANCE, SINGING, ACTING, THEATER? BOB'S TRYING TO ASK IF YOU HAVE TWO LEFT FEET. AS FAR AS BEING THEATRICAL, DANCING BY MYSELF IN THE LIVING ROOM IS SOMETHING ELSE. I CAN'T MOVE SO QUICKLY BUT I WOULD LOVE TO MOVE QUICKLY. THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD LOVE TO DO. I WAS INJURED IN A CAR ACCIDENT. HOW LONG AGO WAS THIS? ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO. THIS JEEP BACKED INTO ME AND I ENDED UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM ON LIFE SUPPORT AND I HAD TO HAVE SURGERY. THAT'S WILD. IN FACT, I HAD TO HAVE SCREWS PUT IN IN MY SPINE. IT TOOK ME ABOUT THREE MONTHS TO WALK AGAIN AND A FULL YEAR TO LEARN HOW TO RUN AGAIN. IT WAS A VERY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE AND IT CHANGED THE WAY I LOOKED AT LIFE. HOW I FELT, WHAT I WANTED TO DO. LIFE, YOU ONLY HAVE IT ONCE AND IT'S NOT PROMISED. I WANT TO TRY NEW THINGS AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN EXPLORE SIDES OF ME I NEVER THOUGHT I HAD. WORK. NO ONE IS JUST ONE THING. I MEAN, NATE'S NOT JUST QUEER, NATE'S NO JUST INDIGENOUS, NATE'S NOT JUST A MAN, NATE'S NOT JUST AN AMERICAN, NATE'S NOT JUST A PERSON LIVING ON A RESERVATION. HE'S NOT JUST HIS ACCIDENT. NATE IS ALL THESE THINGS PULLED TOGETHER. SO BASICALLY, WE TAKE THAT IDEA AN FIGURE OUT WHAT DRAG WORKS FOR NATE. KNOWING HIM AND KNOWING DARREN, PEOPLE LIKE THAT, THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BRING OUR LIFESTYLE AND CULTURE BACK TO OUR RESERVATION. I THINK IT'S AMAZING. SO, ANYTIME WE GET TO COLLABORATE TOGETHER, IT'S ALWAYS A BLESSING. I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU A FLIER. I'LL PUT IT THROUGH THE DOOR. OKAY, THROUGH THIS PART. OH NO, OH LORD. HI, WE'RE HAVING A SHOW AT THE LOUDER HOUSE SO JUST IN CASE YOU WANT TO COME AND HAVE A GOOD TIME. ALL RIGHT, HALLELU. YOU COULDN'T HAVE GOT AWAY FROM ME NO FASTER, COULD YOU? SO, WE ARE HAVING A DRAG SHOW ON THURSDAY. WE'D LOVE YOU GUYS TO COME OUT AND SHOW SUPPORT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT DRAG IS? NO. YES. I GOT MY FIRST BOOTS IN THIS STORE. DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE DRAG BOOTS IN HERE? NO, PROBABLY NOT. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS AT A DRAG SHOW? I'VE GOT NO IDEA. PROBABLY WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IN A MALE STRIP CLUB. OH. IN A STRIP CLUB, YOU THINK I'M DOING A CARDI B NUMBER. I GUESS SO. I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT THAT WON'T BE THERE. HERE, WE GOT A FREE SHOW IN TOWN. DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO COME?

WHAT ABOUT YOU? I AM ONE OF STACEY'S BEST FRIENDS AND MY SON, WHO ALSO COMMITTED SUICIDE, WAS DJ'S GOOD FRIEND. I'M SO SORRY. WOW. WELL, YOU REALLY CLOSE TO HOME WITH STACEY, I'M SURE, THEN. YES. I'M MELISSA. I AM DJ'S BEST FRIEND. I LOVE YOU SAID, "I AM." I AM. I LOVE THAT. THAT IS MY GO TO. WE JUST OPENED SO MUCH WITH EACH OTHER. WE JUST CONNECTED ON A LEVEL AND THEN WE JUST GOT CLOSER EVER SINCE. WOW. I FEEL LIKE I WOULD HAVE LOVED DJ. YEAH, DUDE, SHE WAS AWESOME. I GOT A LOT OF MY CONFIDENCE FROM DJ. SHE WAS JUST ABOUT IT, JUST TALKING TO EVERYBODY. OH, SHE DIDN'T KNOW A STRANGER. SHE WOULD WALK INTO YOUR HOUSE, "I'M DJ, THANK FOR HAVING ME HERE." SHE DIDN'T KNOW. WE DIDN'T KNOW HALF THE PEOPLE SHE KNEW. HOW MANY PEOPLE SHOWED UP TO THE FUNERAL? OVER 500. 509. WOW. THAT'S WHAT WE COUNTED. WE LOST COUNT. THAT'S WHAT WE COUNTED. DID DJ EVER MENTION TO YOU THAT SHE WANTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE? SHE MESSAGED ME AND SHE GOES, "DUDE, I'M NOT SUICIDAL BUT I WANT TO DIE RIGHT NOW." ME, I GOT PISSED. I GOT MAD. I DIDN'T LOOK AT DEPRESSION AS A DISEASE, I LOST MY BEST FRIEND TO A DISEASE I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN AND NOW I SEE IT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT. IT'S HIT ME HARDER NOW THAN EVER BECAUSE LOOK WHAT IT DID TO US. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE AREA'S A LOT LIKE THAT? HIDE YOUR ISSUES AND YOUR PROBLEMS AND JUST FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT KIND OF ATTITUDE. THROW IT UNDER THE RUG AND THERE'S LIKE A LOT OF BOTTLING IN AND PEOPLE ARE SCARED TO TALK. YOU ALL LOVED THIS PERSON. I CAN'T IMAGINE, ONLY YOU ALL KNOW, WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL THE WORLD WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. THERE IS ACCEPTANCE AND THERE IS LOVE AND THAT WE'RE HERE FOR YOU. LIKE, THESE PEOPLE ARE HERE FOR THEIR COMMUNITY AND YOU ALL ARE, AND ALL THE OTHER ALLIES THAT ARE GOING TO COME TO THIS EVENT. IT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE. IT'S ABOUT JUST BEING VISIBLE. SHOWING PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE THERE AND WHY. SO, IF YOU ARE DOING THAT, THEN YOU'RE DOING IT THE DJ WAY. WELCOME. TAKE A LOOK AROUND. TAKE IT IN. THIS IS OUR SAFE SPACE. WE LIKE TO CALL IT CAMP. AND THEN OVER HERE. OH, I SEE. WHERE THE GLAM. SO THIS IS DOMINO. DOMINO IS IN CHARGE OF OUR DESIGN TEAM. I FEEL LIKE THE INTERSECTIONALITY BETWEEN BEING QUEER, BEING NATIVE, BEING ARTIST, THE CAR ACCIDENT. ALL THESE THINGS WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER TO MAKE YOU WHO YOU ARE TODAY. SO I HAVE THIS VISION FOR THE PERFORMANCE. SO, WE'RE STARTING OUT IN THIS CLASSIC BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN LOOK WITH THE ALL WHITE BANDAGES AND ALL THAT AND HAVING THAT TEAR AWAY AND BE SOMETHING THAT'S MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PARTS OF YOU. IT'S GOING TO BE ALL DIFFERENT FABRICS PATCHWORKED TOGETHER. WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO HAVE DARREN INCORPORATE SOME EMBROIDERY THAT HE'S DONE THAT DOMINO CAN THEN SEW INTO THE GARMENT. I THINK THIS IS SO SPECIAL. JUST BEING A QUEER PERSON ON THE RESERVATION, THAT'S US. THAT'S US BEING PULLED APART. AND NOW THIS EVENT, YOU'RE ALL GETTING SEWN TOGETHER. I LOVE THIS PATTERN. SO, THIS IS GOING TO BE BLACK AND THE EDGING? IT'LL BE WHITE ON THE INSIDE. ALL BLACK ON THE OUTSIDE. YEAH, I LIKE THAT. ME TOO. YOURS ARE CONSIDERABLY LARGER. CAUSE THEY'RE ENORMOUS. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN GOING FAR WITH THE CHARACTER THAT WE'RE CREATING. HOW FAR DO YOU WANT TO GO? I'M OKAY WITH A JUMPSUIT. WE EXPLORE FEMININE IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A DRESS. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO DO HEELS, MAYBE START WITH WEDGES. WEDGES. COME ON NOW. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE TWO EXTREME LOOKS HERE. IS THERE A WAY TO GO FROM THIS HAIR TO A DIFFERENT HAIR. SO, IT COULD BE PULLED OFF. HE COULD HAVE AN OWL ON TOP OF HIS HEAD IF YOU WANTED TO. OWLS ARE BAD LUCK. YOU CAN'T PUT AN OWL ON YOUR HEAD. OKAY, A RABBIT. A RABBIT. IT'S REALLY AMAZING. IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO UPLIFT A QUEEN. I WANT GLITTER ON THE LIDS. I WANT A LITTLE BIT OF AN OPEN EYE. DO YOU HAVE ANY COLOR THEORY THAT'S GOING ON. I JUST LIKE MORE NATURAL STUFF. GOOD LUCK, THAT'S A DIFFERENT SHOW, HONEY. DO YOU KNOW THE REFERENCE THAT I LOVE? THAT WOULD BE A GREAT FLAT TOP. WE'RE TALKING SOLID FOUR INCHES ABOVE YOUR HEAD. SO, I'M JUST GOING TO BE STRAIGHT UP WITH Y'ALL. I DON'T SEE IT. THIS, WITH A MAGNET FLAT TOP DON'T WORK. YOU'LL BE BALD HEADED. YOUR HAIR'S GOING TO BE ON THE GROUND. FOR YOU, I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE OVER-EXAGGERATING YOUR FEATURES AND BRINGING AS MUCH ATTENTION TO YOUR NATURAL BEAUTY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE A CLOWN. OKAY. AH, WHY DON'T YOU EVER SAY THAT TO ME? I SAY IT TO HER ALL THE TIME. SHE JUST NEVER STOPS TALKING. EXCUSE ME FOR ASKING, WHAT SIZE ARE YOU HERE? I TOLD HIM THAT I DIDN'T KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR BRA SIZE? I'VE WORN SPORTS BRAS SINCE JUNIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL. YOU ARE MY MOTHER. YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY YOUNGER THAN A MOTHER, BUT YES MY MOM WEARS SPORTS BRAS. I'M LIKE, "MAMA, WHAT'S YOUR BRA SIZE?" SHE GO, "I DON'T KNOW, A LARGE." I'M A LARGE, OKAY. ALL RIGHT, I GOT YOU. THIS IS DJS SHIRT, HER WORK SHIRT, SHE WOULD CHANGE INTO AT THE LOT. AND SO IT'S ONE OF THE SHIRTS I HAVE OF HERS THAT I HAVEN'T WASHED. IT'S EXACTLY HOW SHE LEFT IT. BUT I PUT IT ON A PILLOW AND I SLEEP WITH IT. AND THEN IT JUST STAYS RIGHT THERE. BRINGS ME SOME COMFORT, LAYING ON IT. ANY COMMUNITY, NOT JUST OUR COMMUNITY, CAN IMPACT A PERSON'S OUTLOOK ON THEMSELVES. WE DIDN'T SEE DJ'S SUICIDE COMING ON LIKE IT DID. WE ALL ACCEPTED HER BUT I THINK THAT SHE KNEW THAT OTHER PEOPLE DIDN'T ACCEPT AND IT WAS HARD ON HER. I KNOW JASMINE BEATS HERSELF UP A LOT BECAUSE SHE WAS THE LAST ONE TO TALK TO DJ. I WASN'T DOING GOOD FOR A LONG TIME AND SHE HAD TO BE THAT PERSON THAT WAS. JASMINE WOULD SHOW UP AT THE HOUSE AND IT WOULD BE TEN O'CLOCK AND SHE'D JUST SIT THERE AND HOLD MY HAND AND SHE'D JUST BE, "I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU, MOM." WE DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT. SOMETIMES I'LL MAYBE START TO VENT TO MY MOM AND MY MOM CAN'T EVEN DEAL WITH HER OWN EMOTIONS, LET ALONE SOMEBODY ELSE'S RIGHT NOW. MOM, ARE YOU EATING? JUST A HALF OF ONE PLEASE. GROWING UP, MY MOM WAS ALWAYS ME AND DJ'S STRONG POINT. SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN OUR ROCK. THAT HAS BEEN ME, HER AND MY MOM THROUGH EVERYTHING. AND TO WATCH MY MOM CRUMBLE AND BE COMPLETELY DESTROYED, I THINK IT'S INTERTWINED ME TO FEEL LIKE MAYBE I WASN'T QUITE ALLOWED TO GRIEVE YET BECAUSE I NEEDED TO GET HER THROUGH THIS. IN A SENSE, I FELT LIKE I NOT ONLY LOST MY SISTER, BUT I'VE LOST MY MOM. YOU KNOW, PERFORMANCE ART IS A REALLY GOOD WAY TO GET OUT THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT. THIS IS KIND OF A CHANCE FOR YOU TO SHOW THESE PEOPLE, WITHOUT HAVING TO TELL ABOUT IT OR BE MAD ABOUT IT, JUST WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH. YOU'VE SUFFERED A HUGE LOSS. THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING FOR THIS EXPERIENCE, I WANT TO START WORKING ON A PROCESS OF, NOT GETTING OVER, 'CAUSE YOU'LL NEVER GET OVER THIS, Y'ALL ARE NEVER GOING TO GET OVER THIS, AND TO ME I THINK THIS PERFORMANCE, AND JUST IN GENERAL THIS EXPERIENCE, I HOPE, IS GOING TO PUSH YOU ALL TO BE MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT YOURSELVES. AND THAT'S WHAT DRAG DOES IS IT HELPS YOU CREATE STRENGTH THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND IT. IT MAKES YOU FEEL POWERFUL. AS EVERYBODY CAN TELL, I'M NOT A VERY EMOTIONAL PERSON VERY MUCH, IT'S JUST SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW HOW CRAZY THE THOUGHTS FEEL IN MY HEAD ABOUT DJ. WELL THE FIRST STEP IS ADMITTING SOME OF THESE THINGS OUT LOUD TO PEOPLE. WHEN WE DID LOSE DJ, IT WAS ROUGH, AND YOU ASKING TO SAY WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HER? I DON'T KNOW THAT I'D BE ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING. ALL I'D BE ABLE TO DO IS GRAB HER AND HUG AND SAY I LOVE YOU, I'M SORRY. AND THAT EVERY DAY SINCE SHE'S BEEN GONE HAS BEEN HELL. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN HELL. I THINK OF HER 24/7. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE TOLD YOU BUT MY MOM FOUND HER. OH NO. I MEAN, I KNEW SHE WAS DEAD BUT I WAS SO HOPING. PLEASE GOD, I'LL TAKE ANYWAY, I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER THE REST OF HER LIFE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER. JUST GIVE HER BACK TO ME. DON'T TAKE HER. AND, MY FRIEND GRABBED ME AND ONE OF MY HUSBAND'S FRIENDS GRABBED AND WAS LIKE, "YOU'VE GOT TO LET HER GO." FROM THERE ON IT JUST WENT THROUGH. THAT IS TERRIFYING. IT WAS PRETTY INTENSE. I DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT MUCH ANYMORE. I APPRECIATE IT. YOU'RE GIVING ME A PIECE OF YOUR EMOTION. YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO SHOW THIS ENERGY IN THIS PERFORMANCE TO PEOPLE AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO KEEP THIS EXPERIENCE FOREVER. MOM, I APPRECIATE YOU OPENING UP. I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, STACEY. I'M PROUD OF YOU TOO. PEOPLE AROUND HERE DON'T FACE THEIR EMOTIONS. THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT, THEY JUST PRETEND LIKE EVERYTHING'S OKAY. STACEY, I THINK THAT SHE'S SEEING THAT HOLDING ALL OF THIS EMOTION IN IS ACTUALLY MAKING THE SITUATION WORSE. AND STACEY HAS TO MAKE A CHANGE, NOT JUST FOR HERSELF BUT FOR JASMINE, WHO'S BEEN CARING SO MUCH FOR HER MOM. IT IS PUMPING OVER HERE. YES IT IS. HI. HI, HOW ARE YOU? GOOD, HOW ARE YOU? I'M DOING GREAT. AWESOME. YEAH. I RECKON WE ARE. CAN I GET AN 11 AND A HALF? COULD I HAVE AN EIGHT, PLEASE? CAN I GET A DAINTY 15? LET'S BOWL. I HOPE Y'ALL ARE READY BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER, SHE MIGHT BE ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES NOW, BUT I'M PUTTING HER THROUGH THE RINGER AND SHE'S GOING TO TURN THE PARTY FOR Y'ALL. LET'S SAY THIS GOAL WILL BE INDICATIVE OF YOUR PERFORMANCE THIS WEEK. LOVELY. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. THIS WILL SET THE TONE. WHOA! HERE WE GO. OOH THAT WAS WIDE. WELL, BOB, IT'S NOT BASEBALL. IT JUMPED OUT OF THE GUTTER. IT SCARED ME. Y'ALL FROM ROUND HERE? NO, WE'RE FROM -- OH WORK. HOW FAR IS THAT FROM HERE? ABOUT AN HOUR. OH THAT'S NOT TOO BAD. WELL, WE'RE ALL PERFORMERS. WE'RE ALL DRAG QUEENS. IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME TO. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'VE JUST GOT TO STAND BEHIND HIM. WELL, HOW HAS YOUR EXPERIENCE BEEN IN ALL THIS? IT'S BEEN VERY CHALLENGING. IT'S SO CRAZY, WE ALL JUST ENDED UP RIGHT BESIDE EACH OTHER HERE. WHO'S THE BEST BOWLER OUT Y'ALL? REALLY? LISTEN, WILL YOU BOWL A FRAME FOR ME? I'M CALLING IN A SUBSTITUTE TO HELP ME WITH A FRAME. OKAY, OKAY. WORK. OKAY. OKAY, OKAY. 'CAUSE SHE'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO DO IT ON HER OWN. BOB IS SO COMPETITIVE. GET READY. HOW YOU GONNA HAPPY DANCE SOMEONE ELSE'S BALL. LISTEN, LIFE'S NOT ABOUT WINNING AND LOSING, IT'S ABOUT DOING YOUR BEST. REHEARSAL TIME. ARE YOU NERVOUS? YEAH. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS. ME TOO. DID YOU ALL DO YOUR HOMEWORK? YES. YES? KEEP IN MIND, THAT NO MATTER WHO HAS EVER PUT YOU DOWN OR NOT ACCEPTED YOU, WHETHER IT'S ANYONE IN THIS COMMUNITY, WHOEVER, I AM WHAT I AM. I AM WHAT I AM. I AM WHAT I AM. ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LET ME FEEL IT. LET'S DO IT. I'M NERVOUS ABOUT I'M NERVOUS ABOUT THE THINGS WE JUST ADDED. SO IT'D BE NICE SO I CAN RUN IT, THAT BE GREAT. OKAY LET'S GO TO THIS SPOT, THEN. HMM. YEP. I NEEDED TO TRY. WE NEED TO DO THIS AGAIN. NO MATTER WHERE I PUSH YOU, TRY TO KEEP LOOKING OUT TO THE AUDIENCE. SO IF I TURN, YOU'VE GOT TO TURN YOUR HEAD AND LOOK THEM, OKAY? OKAY. WATCH THE STAIRS THOUGH. THIS IS THE EDGE OF THE STAGE. GIVE IT TO HIM SIS, GIVE IT TO HIM, SIS. FOOT, FOOT. YOU'VE GOT TO TWIST YOUR BODY, OKAY? 'CAUSE THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOU. OKAY. YOU GOOD, YOU GOT IT. YOU GOT THIS. SO YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO BE IN HEELS THOUGH, RIGHT? I DO. OKAY. 'CAUSE YOU KNOW, GUESS WHAT? I AM GOING TO BE TOO. OKAY. YOU SAID YOU WANT A TRANSFORMATION. YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW IN THE INDIGENOUS CULTURE, QUEERS AND TRANS PEOPLE USED TO BE A PART OF THE CEREMONY. AND DARREN JUST SAID, "THEY FORGOT." THAT HAS BEEN STICKING WITH ME EVER SINCE YOU SAID IT. THEY FORGOT. THEY FORGOT HOW POWERFUL WE ARE. THEY FORGOT HOW IMPORTANT WE ARE. AND THIS IS THE MOMENT WHEN YOU GET TO SAY THESE THINGS AND YOU HAVE THE SPOTLIGHT AND THEY HAVE TO LISTEN. LET'S ACT UP. LET'S CAUSE A SCENE. READY? STEP, STEP. DOWN YOUR FACE. CHEST. THEY'RE A LITTLE HARDER THAN YOU THINK. WE'RE GOING TO START AGAIN. NOW TWIST. SEE THINGS FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE. YEAH, COME ON OUT OF THAT GAS. GET THOSE JAZZ. YES! I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO PROJECT HIS ARTWORK. PICTURES OF HIS COMMUNITY, PICTURES OF QUEERS, PICTURES OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE, FLASHING. LET'S DO IT AGAIN. OKAY. WE'RE JUST GOING TO SEE IF YOU REMEMBER THE SMALL STUFF. WORK. THAT WAS GREAT. HOW DID THAT FEEL? IT FELT LIBERATING. I FELT LIKE I LOST MYSELF. WORK. THAT'S IT. YES. I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU. I KNOW, THIS IS A LOT. LAND IS SACRED. HOME IS SACRED. KEEP THE TRADITIONS ALIVE. WHAT WERE THESE BUILDINGS? THIS WAS A HARDWARE STORE. AND THAT WAS A VIDEO STORE. THE COMMUNITY HERE IS STRUGGLING AND WE NEED A LOT OF AWARENESS BROUGHT TO OUR COMMUNITY. FOR DRAG, I SEE AWARENESS THAT IS BEING SPREAD IN A DIFFERENT FORM. YOU KNOW THE MURALS THAT ARE MADE HERE, I LOOK AT IT AS A SIGN OF HOPE. WHEN I THINK OF THIS PERFORMANCE, I FEEL VERY SCARED ABOUT IT SOMETIMES BUT I'M DOING THIS FOR THE COMMUNITY. I'M DOING THIS TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE A VOICE AND I WANT IT TO BE POWERFUL. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY MESSAGE IS HEARD. HI, HOW ARE YOU? HI. OH MY GOD, IT LOOKS SO GOOD. WOW. OOH, SNACKS. IT'S MOTIVATING. MY iPHONE DOESN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE MY FACE. DRAG IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT. THIS IS A GREAT VEHICLE FOR WHAT HE WANTS TO BE. I HOPE THAT NATE GETS HIS MESSAGE ACROSS.

THE LAST TIME I WORE A DRESS I WAS 18 OR 19. I AM A WOMAN AND JUST BECAUSE I WEAR MEN'S CLOTHES DOESN'T MAKE ME ANY LESS OF A WOMAN. MASCULINITY IS NOT A GENDER AND I THINK THIS IS A WAY TO KIND OF SHOW THAT. PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FOR HER SHE ESQUIRE. THANK YOU GUYS. SO, I'M NOT ORIGINALLY FROM FARMINGTON AND COMING HERE I GOT LUCKY AND I QUICKLY FELL INTO IDENTITY INC'S HANDS AND I WAS ABLE TO MAKE A COMMUNITY THERE. THIS EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN A ONCE IN A LIFETIME. I DON'T THINK I EVER WOULD HAVE DONE THIS IS THERE WASN'T SO MUCH SUPPORT FROM MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SO THANK YOU GUYS. THANK YOU.

I KNOW MOST OF YOU PROBABLY KNEW DJ AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING ALL OF THIS. SHE WAS PRETTY SPECIAL. I DID WANT TO REALLY GIVE IT TO MY MOM BECAUSE SHE HAS BROKE THROUGH BOUNDARIES WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET HER TO BREAK THROUGH FOR THE LAST YEAR, IN A WEEK, YOU GUYS. WE KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH WE WANT TO MEMORIALIZE DJ, DJ WOULD WANT TO CELEBRATE LIFE. SHE WOULD WANT TO BE CELEBRATED AND SHE WOULD WANT HER MOTHER AND HER SISTER TO ENJOY THE ART OF DRAG AND BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU HOW FUCKING FIERCE THEY ARE. I FEEL GOOD. I FEEL GOOD. IT ACTUALLY FEELS BETTER. SHE WENT UP THERE AND SHAKE YOUR ALL HANGING OUT. OH THERE WE GO. YOU CAN DO THIS. YES. I NEED TO LET HER BE AT PEACE AND I NEED TO START LIVING. EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. YOU STEPPED UP AND THAT IS GOING TO CARRY YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, THE ABILITY TO STEP UP, STEP OUTSIDE YOUR COMFORT ZONE. AIN'T NOBODY COME AT YOU WITH NOTHING DIFFERENT, THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T CONQUER. DRAG IS BEST WHEN IT SPEAKS TO YOU. WE ARE ALL THE PRODUCT OF THESE WORLDS THAT OVERLAP. THAT'S WHAT A QUEEN IS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? ALL THESE PARTS, NO MATTER WHERE THEY CAME FROM, HAVE MADE US STRONGER. I WANT US TO ALL PUT OUR HANDS TOGETHER. I LOVE YOU, JASMINE. I'VE HAD SUCH AN HONOR OF GETTING TO KNOW THIS FAMILY. I APPRECIATE IT SO MUCH. AND WE THANK YOU. NO, I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR, ON THE COUNT OF THREE WE RELEASE THIS IN DJ'S HONOR. ONE, TWO, THREE. WHY ARE YOU CRYING? I'M NOT CRYING. WE'RE GOING TO PARTY TONIGHT. OKAY? Literally let's fish, fish! Oi! We are up at Ruston, Louisiana. Hello, hello! - Tie it, cinch it, that waist! - Tie? You see something you like? I'm a lesbian, and I'm a double amputee. And I just wanna be accepted, just the way I am. The more attention that is on me, the harder it is here in Ruston. I'm a heterosexual male, and I'm willing to step outside my comfort zone and make other people welcome. Ally voices are as strong as queer voices themselves. You should be able to wear whatever you wanna wear, you should be able to be who you wanna be. What? We don't want no drags-- Y'all don't wanna drag show, what?
