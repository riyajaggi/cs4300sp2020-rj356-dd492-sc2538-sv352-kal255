 Tits up, man down... So much blood. I seen the alien! I piss standing up! - Great mix, Hamot. - One more signature, patient 13... - Mulatto! - No, no, no. - Come on! - Patient 13, if you feel the urge to release any rage or anger, please focus it on 88. Oh, I see. Nope, get me out of this. The dog was enough, doc. - Excuse me, 13. - Look at my hands! You know how thirsty I am? - What are you looking at? - Science. - Somebody cut me out of this! - 88, being engaged in her therapy is a very important part of your therapy. Confidence! You're part of a team and today the most important part of this team! Fine. Fine, yes. Fine, yeah. Plus, the last time she was here, she broke up nearly half of the equipment. If she goes after anything or anyone, jump in her way! - I believe in you. - Fine. - Hey, has anyone seen my... [gunshot] - Oh! - Ooh. - My milkshake! - What the hell? - Just part of her training. - For what? The war on sweets? Patient 13: No, the Shadow Scaring conflict. 10 people dead, including my best friend! Uh, okay. Well, speaking of tragedies, has anyone seen my Garfield sweatshirt? It says lasagna naps, orange cat... sleeping on lasagna. No one? - Can't say that I have. - God damn. - Where's my lasagna shirt?! - Doc, I've seen too much shit. ♪ So said the dairy farmer ♪ We'll fix you, 13, rest assured. Okay. I don't want to fight anymore. [music] - Okay, should be a walk in the park. - I hate parks! Tango trap sites, ankle cutters, bouncing Betty! Okay, well, let's get you under. Okay? A little pain. - Ah, shit! - Aah! [thud] POV cams are up. Thank you, 88. You better not have [bleep] me up in there! You hear me, Larry? You hear me, Larry?! [music] You better not [bleep] me up in there! You [bleep] me up, I'll [bleep] so badly... ... grandkids are gonna pull my toenails out of their bony-ass asses. [Echoing] Ass asses, ass asses, ass asses, ass asses... [Chuckles] Ass asses. Doctor! The beta scans show the patient's complete reliance - on a fight or flight instinct. - Did someone adjust my chair? I tell people, "Don't adjust this!" I said that, right? I said that. - Out loud? - Yes! - Just now? - Right, good. Right, good. Doctor, the patient's problems seem rooted in early development, statistically linked to a familial relationship. Oh, let me see that. Oh. Mm. [Bones crack] Oh, it's perfect. Randy! [Whirring and beeping] Lovely day for a dream walk, isn't it? Mulatto! [grunts] Oh! Wow, right in the Peter's peach. - What? - Peter's peach. - No. - Peter's peach. T.E.R.R.Y.: Fast break. Just had lunch with a waffle iron. Sparks flew. Dammit, T.E.R.R.Y. That's my sweatshirt! T.E.R.R.Y.: Is it? Thought it was mine. You don't have clothes. What the hell? - Randy... - T.E.R.R.Y.: Stay away! - Give it back! - T.E.R.R.Y.: Let go! How did you even get this on? Sorry, doctor. The only thing I've ever known is violence. It's bled into every part of my life, but violence incites violence. Meryl Streep. [Deep voice] I'll remember that always. [Clears throat] Now, look to your left and tell me what you see. Sign spinner. I hate those guys. - Sign spinner! - No, not the sign spinner! Oh, oh! That took me weeks to choreograph that dance! - Ow! - Randy, bypass calibration and drop it directly into REM. Randy? T.E.R.R.Y.: You said I could borrow anything in your closet. That was after you tried killing yourself. That doesn't count. - Guys, guys, the sign spinner. - 88. [Speaks indistinctly] Top yellow button twice. - I'm working with stumps here. - Aah! Randy: You're a bad friend! You bailed on game night... - Randy! - You can't play Banana Grams alone, asshole! - 88, get it together! - What? Press the eject button, it's behind me. You're stretching it out! My arms aren't this long! - Randy! - Hit the red button. - It's all buttons. - The eject button! - T.E.R.R.Y.: Hit the eject button! - Hit it! [Groaning] Doc? Doc, what is happening in there? Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. She's experiencing antagonized cognitive dissonance or as the Hindus would say... [speaks foreign language] or [speaks foreign language] Oh, it's amazing. - Oh, okay. Very good. - No, very bad... What? Or as Hindus call it [speaks foreign language] - Doc, we've just got to keep going. - Ow! Hang in there, 88, you're doing a great job! Oh, nice sweatshirt, T.E.R.R.Y. - It's mine and he's stretching it out. - T.E.R.R.Y.: Oh, so I'm fat? Yeah, and how's the back tattoo removal coming along, tramp stamp? Aah! That was our secret. Man: Stay calm, 13. Where are you? Patient 13: This is my childhood house. [Screaming] T.E.R.R.Y., you're not fat. I needed a work horse, so I created you to have a naturally big boot disk. Nowadays, a lot of robots would die for it. T.E.R.R.Y.: The waffle iron did like it. Randy, T.E.R.R.Y. borrowing your sweatshirt means that he likes your sense of style. - I did make it myself. - And we can tell. I'll never forget what General Jim told me... Basically, no violence. We need to have each other's backs. We're all in this together. - No, stop! Leave me alone! - Nurse... - Don't! - Nurse... Patient 88: Please! [over PA] Nurse summoned to the dream chamber. [over PA] Nurse summoned to the dream chamber. Doc! Man: You okay in here? Hi, baby. [Speaking indistinctly] You're doing great, 88. That dog suit is thick. T.E.R.R.Y.: He looks like a churro. Hamot, hit her with the chloroform. I'm going in. Bea: I got it, her father wanted a boy. The garden and the cocoon represent new life. She needs a fresh start. I think you should lead her to her father. Randy, drop me in. Place your hands over your face and inhale. - Jim Jr. - Dad? - What did you just call me? - It is you. Sir! I tried to teach you to fight for what is right. But all I learned was to fight. The most decorated female in the history of the military. - Still, it wasn't enough for you. - You want to hit me? Go ahead, I always wanted you to. Hit me! Dr. Roberts: From the sea, new beginnings. Take hold of my beautiful hair. My father, what have I done? This was always his battle. Your battle is over. - What do clams make? - Oysters? No, you're thinking of oysters. After years of pressure, darkness and solitude, clams make the most durable and beautiful material in the world, pearls. It's not your fault. He's proud of you. He's always been proud of you. I'm proud of you. That's all the time we have. Sign up for our reward's program. Great progress, wow! But should you feel the urge to react violently towards people, this should help, two to three days. - Two to three days? - Keep 88 for two to three days. If you feel any anger, punch him, kick him, scrape his eyes out, throw him out the window. Just get it out. Spit on him, force him to commit crimes, take him to a movie, spoil the ending, draw his blood, invite your friends. Just beat him with a broom. You can bury him. Just don't bury the suit, the suit is very expensive. It was my grandfather's suit. He died in that suit.
