 Man in TV: Good day to you. I'm T.E.R.R.Y., and I was invented in 1992 by this man, Dr. Roberts. Dr. Roberts will enter your dreams with you, and you will be... - Patient 21? - Hmm? [Camera shutter clicks] I'm Bea. Follow me. After some physical and mental testing, you'll fill out a questionnaire. Take the pill now. It'll help after the session. Trust me. - Did someone die? - This way, please!

 [Music] Hup! [Indistinct shouting] Welcome, Patient, to Dream Corp LLC. - Aah! - Whoa. T.E.R.R.Y.: Holy shit. [Title music] 2x01 - Deep Impact - Ouch. - Say ah. - Ah. Oh. - This should work now. [Electricity crackles] Oh. See here. How does that feel on your head? Yeah, it's fine. It feels fine. All right, now, uh, can you smile for me?

 Frown. And then smile again. [Music] - Okay, great. - Dr. Roberts: Randy, that's enough. Chin up. Welcome, uh, patient number, um ... Is that a 2? Hmm? Ah! I win. I'm Dr. Roberts. What seems to be the issue here today? Every time I fall asleep, I feel like I'm gonna die. - Oh. Hmm. - Doctor, I, uh, I'm at my father's house, and I'm in the hallway and the walls start throbbing. It's a tsunami, and it's coming closer - and closer and closer. - Oh! There you are. Doctor, Patient 21 is suffering from night terrors. Night terrors, very good. One heck of shiner you got there. I slept-walked right into my neighbor's house. - Uh-huh. - And then I started screaming at the pictures on his walls, and so he punched my face. - Uh-huh. - Ah. Are you currently on any medications? Ketamine? Krokodil? Taiwanese bath salts? Experiencing any, uh... chest pains or loss of appetite? No, I actually have no appetite at all. - 88, can you bring me a tuna casserole? - Yeah. Oh, no thank you, Doctor. I have no appetite. - Oh, not you ... me. I'm starving. - Oh. So once we get you under, we'll guide you through the dreams ... your case, night terrors ... locate the root of your issue, and rewire! Yeah. Okay. T.E.R.R.Y.: Guess who's back in the mother... house? Coffee anyone? - Sign here, please. - Huh? Oh, but I haven't read any of that. The terms of service state that you understand the risks involved with this procedure, that you agree Dream Corp LLC will record and own your dreams for eternity. - Once you sign them, we can start. - Uh, little pinch. [distorted] POV cams are up. Thank you, nurse. Ah, you've come to the right place. Can't promise that you won't wake up with another issue. Sometimes that happens, and other times, it does, too. [distorted] Let's calibrate you, shall we? Patient 21: Doctor, no, no, no. You don't understand. I truly believe that if I fall asleep, I'll die. I think I changed my mind. I don't want to do this. You came here to fall asleep, didn't you? Right? - I did. - Recurring night terrors, insomnia ... it's our specialty here at Dream Corp LLC. Ahmed, sedation! [Machinery whirring] - ♪ I'm coming down the tube ♪ - No, excuse me! [Music] Who-o-o-oa! [Music] [Electricity crackles] Hey... [Music] H-Holy shit. - Hmm. - Here you go, Doc. Ah. Randy, how much longer 'til REM sleep? Uh... - Ants! - Doctor, we should be cautious. Night terrors begin before REM. The sedative could take longer. Bea, I've been doing this over 30 years. I think I know the stages of sleep. [Music] - Doctor... - Aah! [Squeals] Asshole! [Grunting] - Oh! - Aaah! Use your ether pen, 88! - What? - The ether pen! - What? - Aah! Bea: Use the pen! The ether pen, 88! - Get ... - Get the pen! His teeth are sharp. My shiv is not working! [Screams] - T.E.R.R.Y.: Lick the pen! - Randy: Lick it! - T.E.R.R.Y.: Lick the pen! - Lick it! - Lick it?! - Yeah! Lick the pen! - I can't believe he licked it. - I know! [Screaming] [Screaming stops] [Monitors beeping] Everyone okay in there? - Bea: Yeah! - Didn't see that coming. [Moaning] [Clears throat] - Randy: Wow, that goofball got you, huh? - [Grunts] A little bit. Uh, T.E.R.R.Y., could you run over into the lab - and get me a tuna casserole? - T.E.R.R.Y.: Copy that. Hello, 21. Can you hear me? Patient 21: I can, actually. Oh, my God. Am I asleep? Randy: Um, no. We made a mistake, and... you're dead now. - What? - I'm sorry. What was that? Did you say I died? - I'm so sorry. - I died in my sleep. I knew it. You guys, I knew I was gonna die if I fell asleep, and you let me fall asleep! - Still got it. - It's a very funny joke, Randy. - No, no. You're not dead. - What? Just kidding. I wish you were dead. I would be very rich if you were dead and I were talking to you. Unfortunately, no, you're alive and well just like the rest of us. Now, look to your left and tell me what you see. Oh, it's one of those sign spinners. - I hate those guys. - Look deep into the sign, 21. Now spin the sign. Spin it. Move the sign with your mind. Good. Calibration is complete. [Music] I'm ready whenever you are. [Keypad beeping] - Drop me in. Randy? - Dialing 9. Locked and loaded, Doctor. [Electricity hums] [Vocalizing] 21, stand up. Why are you just sitting there? We're on the clock. I think when you said I was dead, maybe I was I just like, "Well, we're all dead anyway, so maybe I am dead because I was dead." I've been there. Chin up. We have work to do. Tell me, what does this beehive mean to you? [Bees buzzing] [Gasps] [Monitors beeping] - Oh, hey, Sleeping Beauty. - T.E.R.R.Y.: There he is. - Thought I was gonna have to kiss you awake. - [Both laugh] Thanks, Randy. Bea: Interesting. A honeycomb represents money, and a hive represents a lover. Oh, and there she is. [Groans] [Laughs] Oh, it's Rebecca. Oh, baby. [Laughs] What? What? [Music] Oh, no, Doctor. This is how my dream starts. Dr. Roberts: That's what we're here for. We're you're friends. Be brave. - This is my father's house. - It's nice. Crown moldings. Oh! [Grunts] Weather's changing. [Animal roars] [Music] 21! 21! I'm gonna lose you! [Animal roars] Randy! [Gasps] [Groans] Doctor, the trophy on the mantle, the panther splitting in two ... it's a separation of power. If we can identify what the tsunami symbolizes, the night terrors will stop ... theoretically. Is your nose bleeding, or is it more of a leakage? Kind of a bloody leak down the back of my throat. Tell me. - Do you feel this? - You stepping on my toe? Correct. You're good. She's good. Doctor, I think this case is less about relationship, more about moving forward, fear of the future. You might want to change that nose cotton. - I just did! - Ah, Randy, I'm going back in. Randy: All right. [Machinery whirring] [Snores] [Music] Oh... Oh. My god. [Woman laughing] [Sighs, clears throat] [Music] Ooh. Hoo. [Laughs] [Dripping] [Laughs] Oh! Oh! [Music] [Screaming] - Dr. Roberts! - 21! 21! 21! [Speaking Japanese] 21! 21! Oh, there you are. Oh, God, the tsunami. [Humming] - Where is my wife? Rebecca? - Rebecca's not the issue, 21. I thought she said she moved on without me. She left me, and I can't find anybody else. Is that what this is all about? - Come on. - It's hard being a human being. We're all uncertain, 21. You're the kind of the guy who wants to fix the problems of the world, but the world doesn't care about you. Guess what, neither does your wife. Well, that's a little harsh. Nope. You can't be afraid of what's to come! The swan doesn't need to wash itself to be white, it just is! Be yourself. Move forward. This wave ... you need to ride it and dive into it. You're wife is gone, and the world is on fire. You deserve to be in love. [Music] It's up to you ... with your eyes closed. Close your eyes. [Akron/Family's "Don't Be Afraid, You're Already Dead" plays] Randy: Welcome back, Doc. [Gasps] [Music] ♪ Don't be afraid ♪ ♪ It's only love ♪ - ♪ Don't be afraid ♪ - Did you say yes to peanut allergy? - So he's dead? - Bea: No, his vitals are better than when he arrived. By all assessments, he's actually sound asleep. [Snoring] Let him rest. He deserves it. Good job, everyone. Good job. [Applause] - ♪ It's only love ♪ - All right. Get some sleep, big day tomorrow. - Doc, it's 11:00 a.m. - What? - Bea: Our next patient is in the waiting room. - Well, then... get him up. Get him up. Get him out of here. - This isn't a hotel. - Hey, buddy! ♪ Love is simple ♪ ♪ Love is simple ♪
