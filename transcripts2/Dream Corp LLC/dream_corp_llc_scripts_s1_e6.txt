 Decontamination in progress. Decontamination in progress. Decontamination in progress. Decontamination in pro... gress. Ahmed, put her in the lawn chair. - She's already in the lawn chair. - Okay, good. I can't believe you left her in here. She's needs to be phoned out. Randy, I'm gonna need you here buddy. POV cameras are up, Doc. This is bad! She's really moving in there! She's heading to the void. - Uh! Uh! - Ahmed, are you okay? I shouldn't have eaten all those chocolates. What's happening to her?! She's running to the center of her mind. - What? Why? - That's the fascinating thing, 88. Most people wouldn't even know how to go there, - but she is heading directly to it. - Is she gonna die? If she makes it, you know what'll happen? She'll get trapped in her subconscious, and that means, 88, a coma for her. If we don't get her out, she ain't coming back. But that doesn't matter to you, because you don't work here anymore. So you don't have to worry about it. Randy, I'm gonna need to go under hard and fast. Doc, we needed to get you in there 5 minutes ago! Ugh. My legs! I can't feel my legs, 88! Doc, it's now or never! [Bleep] God! [Bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] Fine. Just drop in. I'll ... I'll get the mouth guard. - Don't forget the Vaseline. - Don't be that guy. Mnh. Perfect, perfect, perfect! Hurry up! I'm going in uncircumcised, Randy. Copy that! Welcome back, 88. Good to have you. Godspeed, Doctor. Boom! - Going in uncircumcised. - What does that mean? It means he's not coming out until we cut him out. I can't feel my legs 88. Yah! You're in her brain.  Be careful. Randy, do you read me? I have audio and video, Doctor.  You're a go. - My meters say she's right here. - Same with mine. Weird. Joey! What has she become? I'm here to take you back... up there. Why would I go up there? No one listens to me. My internship has lasted nine years, and... Doctor, well, I've had enough. Why should I go back up there when in here I could breathe fire and my voice sounds like this? Your voice does sound quite amazing. Is that Liam Neeson? Oh, yes! Totally Liam Neeson! I was like, "Who do I sound like?" and I couldn't put my finger on it. It was so familiar. That's exactly it! And I don't even try. This is just how I talk now, which is pretty cool, yeah? Anyway... I can be myself down here. And from down here, I run the whole goddamn game. I'm in the firewall. The bitch has brains. I respect that. Doc, that firewall is gonna take all the power you have. Ugh! Great! Great work, Randy. - Thank you. - Do you think some firewall you built in 1992 is gonna protect you from me? Randy! No! No! No! Help! You got to get him out of there, Randy! I'm trying! She's too strong! We don't have enough power! He's uncircumcised! - Well, circumcise him! - I don't have enough power! - T.E.R.R.Y. - What? You're our only hope. We need your power, buddy. - That would mean... - Yes. For Roberts to survive, you'll need to human centipede to the hard drive. Oh [bleep]! [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] - Can we do it to me? - Bitches. [Bleep] [bleep] - No way. - [Bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] No, no. It really needs to be T.E.R.R.Y. He has a battery and shit. Joey, you don't know what you're embarking on. I can do whatever I want. The world is mine! Good luck old friend. Yes. Cheers. Yeah. Eww. This isn't you, Joey. I've never felt more like myself. Come on! You got this! Noooo! Hurry! We got 90 seconds to get her in the lab. Get the electrodes. I wasn't strong enough. We're just glad you're back, Doctor. - You had us worried in there. - T.E.R.R.Y. Yes, Dr. Roberts? Thank you. I d-do feel violated, but you'd have done the same for me. Umm, yeah. 88, get the door. May I help you? Are you with the police? FBI? IRS? IRS? United States Military, fourth generation, Special Divisions. General Jim Joy Noyes, Jr. My father wanted a boy. I'm looking for Dr. Roberts. Do you have an appointment? Uh, Dr. Roberts is with a patient right now, so you could come back, um, in a month or so. - Hm. - Excuse me, General Jim ... I want you to ask Dr. Roberts if he remembers me, - patient 13. - Okay. Yeah, I'll do that. Thank you. - Perfect. - What the [bleep] happened to you? I'm a doctor.
