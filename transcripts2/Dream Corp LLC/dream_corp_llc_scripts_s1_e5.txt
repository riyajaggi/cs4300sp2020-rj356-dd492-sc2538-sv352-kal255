 Hello. I'm Dr. Roberts, founder of Dream Corp LLC. I invite you once again to consider us for the Western Elite Medical Inventors Coalition Grant. Allow me to show you why our work here deserves stronger consideration. Let's head over this way, shall we? And here's a patient now. I thought you said this was anonymous. 1x05 - You Down with OCD This is ridiculous. Why am I being so formal? I'm explaining to WEMIC who WEMIC is? They...

 They know who they are. I feel so stupid. I'm sorry, I'm nervous. I'm just... are you nervous? - No. - I hate asking for money. I don't think we have much choice 'cause you can't keep this place open just selling your garbage on eBay. Those are collectibles, 88. Those are collectibles. And I'm not gonna stop doing that. You don't just bail on a star rating that high. Confidence, doc. What did you tell me about confidence, right? You're right, okay. - Give me just a second here. - Yeah. Three, two, one, let's go. - We're on our way to the dream chamber right now. - Mm-hmm.

 And I can't wait till you see what we have going on in there. And here's Patient 46 right now. You're okay, Patient 46. You're doing great. Thanks. Trying to get better. - I think you're doing great, 46. - Thank you. Never before has there been such an extreme example of obsessive-compulsive disorder. - And here is our intern, Joey, and she's... - Ow. 88, over here. Here's our intern, Joey, and... Joey, she does her... her best at everything. Go, go. There he is. - This is my oldest-functioning accomplice, T.E.R.R.Y. - Hello. And he just turned the big 2-1. Doctor, can I get my beads, please? Yeah, sure, of course. I've got them right here. There you are. - Hello there. - Now, if you can imagine... Excuse me, hi. T.E.R.R.Y. ...our personalities are like the Golden Gate Bridge. Nice to meet you. You can shake that or put cups in it. - Dude, T.E.R.R.Y. - Shut up, I'm talking. T.E.R.R.Y. Will you be... I'm talking to the lady. - Just... I'm watching you. - ...un-welding it... That is what we do here at Dream Corp LLC. Big hand washer, 46. I used to do this glove trick in high school. Sit tight. Gets them soft, keeps them soft. Looking good, 46, if you don't mind me saying. Ready when you are, Doc. There he is, captain Randy Blink there in the cockpit. "Cockpit!" He's been my sidekick. He's here 24/7. Good afternoon, Patient 46. You are scheduled today for a 2 hour and 45-minute dream log, which includes an I.V. drip and complimentary protein misting. - Patient 46's file. - Patient 46's file. Is suffering from mysophobia, fear of germs. Raised in a nursing home. The smells, sure. Okay, let's get her ready for calibration, shall we? Let's put her under. Ahh. See? This ain't so bad. Yeah, I guess not. Wonderful job so far, 46. Look ahead and tell me what you see. My mother's house. Now look to your left. Tell me what you see. A sign spinner. I hate those guys. Don't be afraid, 46. He cannot hurt you. - Wha... - Hey, you're doing awesome, 46. You got a true fan for life out here. - What the [bleep] is your deal? - [Bleep] is your deal? Move the sign with your mind. Spin it. Spin that sign. Spacial calibration is complete. Have fun in there. Try and avoid the day residue. Dig deep. Ahmed, uh, her levels are reading a little low. Seeing the same thing here, Randy. We're... Ahmed, any difference between the regular ketamine and the generic? - No, checks out. - Roger that. Time to wake up. Chop, chop. - Is she sleepwalking in her dream? - She's fascinating. Show us around the house, 46. It's morning and my clothes match. Father? Where are you? Don't put the hot dogs in the mac and cheese. I like her. She's edgy, you know? - Dark. - She's great. - Yeah. - Crippling OCD isn't a deal breaker for you guys? No. I prefer schizophrenics. It's like you're getting fingered by two people at once. You are now Queen of the Cones. You are every pine cone and every seed in every cone. Thank you, m'lady. But what of you? I am you, the Pine Cone Queen. You're so meticulous. ♪ Sleep little princess ♪ - T.E.R.R.Y. - What? - Try to be professional, okay? - Make me. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah? T.E.R.R.Y. saw her first, 88. He gots dibs. Doctor, Patient 46 is showing signs of waking. - She's barely under. - All right. Call Ahmed. He'll figure it out. - Nurse Ahmed to the dream chamber. - There's a little crack in the tube. That's what's happening. That's why it's leaking. We've got a runner! - Remember, do not wake her up. - Copy that, Doctor. - She will die. - Doc? Can everybody hear me? We can hear you, 88. Go ahead, what? - Doc, I don't think... - 88, do you copy? 88, we hear you perfectly. Give us your location. What is this? "Sublevel sector 6." - 88, get out of there. - 88, don't go in there! "Optical laser scanner." - 88! - Intruder. Oh! Oh... Probably overdid it with the security system in the laundry room. It was a weird time. - Patient 46, are you in here? - Hello? - No sign? - No. Oh, h-hey, Randy. Hey, T.E.R.R.Y. Hey, J.O.E. 12. Is... Is it time to come out? Yep. Any day now. - You want to look somewhere else? - Definitely. What are you guys looking for? - Okay. - I can come with. - Take care. Uh-huh. - Hey. Don't... Oh! What did I come in here for? Hey, 88. Whatcha doing? We're looking for Patient 46. What are you doing? - Milkshake break. - Milkshake break. - Cool. - You want me to make you one? - No. - See you later. Hey, 46. Are you... Are you okay? Do you ever get really sad when you realize that you won't be able to live on Mars but others will? - Yeah. Every day. - Don't ever run away again. You're... You're touching my hands. - You're getting better, 46. - Of course I am. When you first got here, I-I thought there was something between us, and I was like, "Am I crazy? Is this real?" And then when the doctor said we had to find you... I wanted to say, "I've been looking for her my entire life." Is it possible that I'm falling in love with you right this second? I hope so. Oh, no! - Doc! - Great job, 88! The old pretend to be listening trick. I used to use it all the time when I was your age. - Who are you? - 88, huh? Remember? Fascinating, fascinating case. Sleepwalking in all states. - She was... She was asleep? - Oh, yes, she was. - Great job, 88. Congrats, man. - Get out that video camera. Dear WEMIC. These guys, they need insurance, and we really need new equipment, and we... we need new anesthetics, and Randy does - all the physicals and... - I don't mind. If you can award us the grant, it would be nice. Three, two, one, cut. - Great job, Doc. - So, what is this place, anyway? Oh, this is where T.E.R.R.Y. and I sleep. - You guys live here? - Yeah, I came in here 15 years ago. Yes, it was 15 years ago. Came in for an appointment. I had a fear of heights, but ended up catching agoraphobia. Can't leave. Let me give you the grand tour! "T.E.R.R.Y.'s palace." Over here is the only picture of my mom I have. This is the celebrity smile wall. This is where I practice a lot of my smiles. Kenny Rogers, Dwyane Wade. Look it. Who is it? Julia Roberts, see? See? Julia Roberts. See? Yeah, Julia Roberts. I can see it.
