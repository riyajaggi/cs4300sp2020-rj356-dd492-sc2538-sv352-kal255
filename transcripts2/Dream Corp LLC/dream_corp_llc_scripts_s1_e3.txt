 - Oh! - Oh. You see that? Yeah. That was close. Whoo! 1x03 - The Predator Good afternoon. I'm Dr. Roberts. And you have a pretty good case of hives going there, Patient 86. Here, hold on to this.

 - Oh, Nurse Ahmed. - Ahmed. Could you please page him for me? Oh, and remind him that, uh, double the dose. - We have couples' therapy today. - Where's the other half? Late, as usual. I even told him it was hot yoga and... 30 minutes earlier than it was. Okay, what I'd like you to do is reflect on the last few days and lick the truth paste. - What? - Lick this truth paste. Lick it. Lick it. Lick it. Nurse Ahmed to the lab, please. Nurse Ahmed to the lab. My name is Brandon. I'm 36 years old. I get dressed to go to the gym, and then I just sit in my car and drink lattes. I once hit a hobo with my car, and then I kept driving. I don't have any black friends! I don't... know if my boyfriend still loves me. There it is. Feels good to be honest. Moshi moshi. Hi. You forgot your man again. Hm. Are you okay? - You have terrible hives. - I know, Rod. No names, please. For patients, it's a rule. You are Patient 103. - Oh. - And this is 86. Follow me. Randy? Randy? - Randy's not here yet. - Okay, go get him. It's okay. I will calibrate you myself. I'm sorry, w-what did you do to me? Would you relax? It's couples' therapy. POV cams are recording... but we won't have visuals on the monitors - until Randy gets here. - I've got it all under control. Uh... Oh. I mean, they'll be okay. It's gonna be okay. Randy? Look! - Ohh. - Pretty cool. Dr. Roberts needs you needs you in the dream chamber. Okay. Almost finished. Want me to ask you about your hand? So, what happened to your hand, Randy? Well, it's a funny story, but the takeaway is the guys down at the 5-0 Vape are never gonna believe that I almost lost my rig. - Your what? - My mod. - I'm sorry, what? - My rig. Well, it's a great hand. Yeah, thanks. I got it off the robot there. Started him in high school. Never got around to finishing him. That looks pretty good. - It's as good as new, right? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, Randy... - Stop it! - I-I get it. I get it. - It's the magnets! Don't look me eye then when you're doing it! - Gah! - Oh, no! Randy, Dr. Roberts needs you immediately. This is... It's not what it looks like, T.E.R.R.Y.! - Yes, it is! - No, it's not! - Randy... - Ow! Come back in here! - What was that thing? - Don't worry about it. - Whoo! - 86! 103! Slow down! Slow this down... Doc?! Oh, God. - Come on, go ride! - Oh, yeah?! No. Um... Randy, where are you?! Nope, nope! Help! Randy! - Sorry. - Wow. Look at those stairs. Come on. If these guys goes any further, we're gonna lose 86. Hello? Is anyone there? Yeah, I'm here, Doc. What do you need? 88! Thank God. Do you see the mouthpiece hanging right next to me on the wall? - Uh, yeah. - Put that in my mouth. I don't want to bite off my tongue today. But wait. First, there's Vaseline in my pocket. - What? - Take the Vaseline out, gently put the Vaseline on my lips... - Okay. - ...and slide the mouthpiece into my mouth, in that order. What the hell was that? Whoa! Dr. Roberts! Hello?! What are you doing? Hey, Rod! Stop! Stop, Rod, stop! I got you! - If anything happens... - Yes? - ...I just want to be clear... - Yes, tell me. ...this whole thing was your idea. No-o-o-o-o-o! - Randy! - What's going on? We skipped calibration, and the patients went off the rails early, because that guy from the "Predator" attacked them. - Schwarzenegger. - No. - Carl Weathers? - No. The actual Predator. Oh! Nobody? Seriously? None of you remember your CPR training? Y'all forgot it? - Well, that's... - Do something! All right. Who-o-o-o-o-a-a-a-a!! I think he's probably dead. - No. - I mean, it's probably... His time has come. _ - Randy! - It's too hard! T.E.R.R.Y., give Dr. Roberts a boost. We're gonna need to get him out, if he's as deep as I think he is. I'm on it, Randy. Buckle him in tight! I'm gonna pull him out. Randy, forget the tie! My captain's down! I'm the co-pilot. Hang on, Dr. Robert! I'm coming in for you. S.M.A.R.T., I need in 86's dream base. Let's get you out of there! Th... That one was my fault. Should've started with 103... totally my bad. Doctor, I think I've got it. The murky waters 86 is navigating, the foreign language, it's all based on a lack of communication. Let me borrow that binder. A-a-a-a-a-a-a-h. Randy, move these guys to 103's brain and call it a day. Copy that... locked into 103 now. What happened to your hand? - What happened to your hand? - You bit it. Rod, where are you?! - Rod? - No names, please. Tray table's up... wheel's down. I can't move my legs! Enjoy your new face with a natural... Commercials? Yeah, he didn't pay for the premium package. Okay, I'm moving into 103's brain now. ...oil, a web product. Don't, Rod! This is our life, and you always run. You run from the Predator, you run from me. Honey, you run from everything. The Predator's right... I take you for granted. Thanks, The Predator. Strong, he's so strong. - This is nice, isn't it? - This is lovely. Dr. Roberts, where were you? Oh, I was just giving you, uh, your space so could share experience to better understand each other. Three's a crowd. Hey. Give me your hand. - I'm so sorry. - Why? - That moment on the hot-air balloon... - Oh, I dropped you. - No! I let go on purpose. - W-What? I let go on purpose so you'd feel guilty. - Bitch. - But I am never gonna let go again. - Brandon... - No names, please. - 86... - Huh? Will you marry me? Um, does your chest hurt? - No. - 'Cause I'm injured. It feels like... like a robot punched me in the chest. Oh, yeah. It's broken, definitely.
