 Family Tree (2013–…): Season 1, Episode 5 - Welcome to America - full transcript 
 Tom arrives in California to stay with Al and Kitty, who make him very welcome - although he is inexplicably scared of their cat. In the middle of the night he is woken by a Skype from Monkey to tell him that Bea has lost her job. At the weekend Al and Kitty hold a barbecue inviting other cousins, the married Rick and Julie, and the rather strange Dave - whose Peruvian wife has gone missing and who claims to have a vestigial tail. He also tells Tom that Charles Chadwick fled to England in the aftermath of the American Civil War, possibly because he was an accomplice to the murder of Abraham Lincoln.

 - Tom! - Here, look-- whoa! - Oh, Tom. - Tom! - So sorry. - No. - The traffic. - Are you late? I didn't even notice. - Great to meet you. - The freeway was a sardine can. So lovely to meet you. Hi. - Oh, look. Hey. - Look at what-- look. - Aw! - I made this today. That's so sweet, Kitty. - Yes. Do you like it? - Come on, I got the car right here. - Great. - Let go. - Let go. - Okay. Remember, we're having a BBQ tomorrow. We're having a barbecue in your honor. You're gonna meet your relatives. - Rick Tillman from the Tillmans is coming. - And Julie. - And Julie. Rick and Julie. - Julie, his girlfriend. David Chadwick's coming all the way from the Carolinas. - Oh, my God. - He's on a road trip. He drove his car across the whole country. - That's great. - I'm gonna make a big salad. You're gonna see all your relatives. - Oh, it's... - Do you like music? I do, yeah. - Do you like R&B;? - R&B;? Put it on, put it on. Yeah. Oh, great. Wow. Check it. Mm-hmm. ♪ She's the kind of lady... ♪ Uh-huh. ♪ She's the kind of woman ♪ ♪ I call her baby ♪ ♪ And she calls me uh-uh... ♪ - Yeah. - ♪ When I see her walking... ♪ How about it? How about it? Does R&B; mean the same thing here? - Yes, rhythm and blues. - Oh! ♪ She's my lady baby... ♪ It's so beautiful. Someone's got green fingers. - That's me. - Is it? We love this neighborhood. - It's just perfect. - We just love it, love it, love it. - Palm trees on your roads. - Yeah. Here we are. Ooh! It's lovely. Thank you. This really is quite beautiful, guys. - Oh, thank you. - All her keen eyes. She did all this. - No. - I did, I did. I actually got a book and I read a book about how to redo a house, and that's how I learned. Well, it worked. It was a good book. Well, thank you. Thank you. And sí casa c'est mi casa. Well, I think you're trying to say, "Mi casa es su casa." "Our house is your house" en español. Oh, yeah. I saw there was loads of Mexicans at the airport. Yeah, it's... California. - Yeah. - While you're here, anything you need, anything you want, you just tell us. - Thank you. - I grew up in this house. This was my father's house and there's a lot of-- a lot of great memories in this house. I can't, for the life of me, remember any of them, but... So, you wanna see your room? - I have my own room? - And your own loo. Stop it. Well, I'm Al Chadwick and I was born and raised in Glendale, California. And I'm a podiatrist, the son of a podiatrist. I can say I successfully followed in my father's footsteps. Met a lovely lady some years ago. Seated to my left here. I saw her number on a bathroom wall. She's not that kind of girl and I'm not that kind of guy. Some prankster put her number there. But it was kismet. It was serendipity. We were destined to meet and we've been in love ever since. We have. We have. - This is your suite. - Oh... Our daughter's away at grad school, so this is all yours. It's been a while since I've been in a college girl's bedroom. - Oh, really? - Hopefully this will be less harrowing. Well, she won't be back for a while. Terrific. It's great. Well, this is embarrassing. So just-- I was fostering a senior citizen basset hound who had a little bit of a bladder control-- - We've gotta recarpet this. - I know, but in the meantime-- - We'll throw something over it. - Some sand or something. - We've all been there. - Yeah. And this is your bathroom. - Your very own. - Sweet. That's great, actually. That's about to see some serious action. Oh. Well, it's all yours. And I am gonna get dinner started. What would you like to drink? Uh, I'll have a lager. That'd be great. Oh, that's a beer. Oh, a beer. Yeah. Now, it's cold. Do you mind? Shall I heat it up for you? No, that'd be fine. - Cold works-- - Cold's okay? Okay. - Cold works well. - Lager. Lager. Lager. That's close enough. - Thank you. - Okay. Oi. - Hello. - Tommy... - it's me. - Hey, Pete. Hey! How are you? - I'm in America! - Yay! You're in America! - What's a bear's favorite pasta? - What? Oh, shit-- I don't know, Pete. What's a bear's favorite pasta? - Tagliatelle. - What? Teddy! Tagliateddy. Oh-- tagliateddy, not tag-- you all right? I'm great. I mean, I'm a bit jet-lagged, but I'm all right. What time is it there? Uh... I'm still on old time-- wait, what time is it-- it's really late there. It's 3:00 in the morning here. - Where are you? - I'm at work. I've been up all night. I've been helping the zebu give birth to a little baby zebu. It came out of its mom's... front one. Yeah, that's how that works. Any-- listen, - I can't wait to see you. - You too. It's gonna be amazing. Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing you, man. All right, buddy. Love you! - Love-- - Bye! Yeah. Oh-- toilet. "I'm looking forward to meeting Pete." Yes, that's gonna be fun. I'm excited that Pete is coming to visit. I'm a little worried how Kitty will deal with him. Pete's great. But when he used to come and visit when I was living in Ireland with my mom, he-- he would insist on sleeping naked. Which is fine when you're at home. But when you're camping or sleeping on your friend's mother's couch, it's a little-- it's different. So this would be my great-great- grandfather Charles. - Yes. - And this chirpy little chiquita - is his wife Rebecca. - Rebecca and Charles. Yeah, this would be a brother of your great-grandfather Edward. Edward. So this would be my great-granduncle. That's the one. And here he is in his military garb during the Civil War, but there's a button missing. And I found a couple of buttons in-- in Victoria's box. I don't know what that one is for, but this one looks like it's a match. - Isn't that amazing? - Let me look at-- The British are coming! The British are coming! - ♪ Ta-ta ta-ta! ♪ - Oh, boy. My neighbor. There he is! - Hey. - Sorry, my bagpipes are in the shop. Your Majesty, I beg your indulgence. - Enter, sir. - Mike. - Hello. - How are ya, Al? - Very good, Michael. - Seen anything mysterious lately - you want to report? - Just now I did. - Hi, I'm Mike. - Hello. - And you're? - I'm Tom. We're just getting over the Beatles invasion. Hey, I brought you some English muffins so you'd feel comfortable. That's very thoughtful, Mike. Thank you. You might wanna toss them in the toaster. I understand these Brits like their buns warm and well-buttered. I don't know what that means, but okay. And something to take back to England to your friends-- this is a toothbrush with a book of instructions. Use it twice a day and call me in the morning. - That's-- - I'm just having some fun with you there. 'Cause we've got bad teeth. Yeah. So, is this your first time in the States? Yeah, first time. American virgin. So listen, we have a great country. Make a point to see it. You can ski in the snow, you can swim in the ocean. Or if you wanted, you can go to San Francisco and go both ways. - Oh. - You know? Okay. - Hi, Kitty. - Hi, Mike. How are ya? - You look great. - Oh, thanks. It's good to see you. - You staying regular? - Oh, trying. - Okay. - You know, trying. Oh, sh-- I didn't-- sorry, I didn't know you had a cat. Oh, that's Kitty. We rescued her from a really, really horrible high-kill shelter. Very, very sweet. No claws. - You like cats? - What's that? - Do you like cats? - Uh, yeah, I like cats. I like cats. I'm pretty allergic to them. Oh. You want me to move the cat? Yes, that would be terrific. Don't kill it. - Careful, careful. - Oh. Yeah. It's vicious, isn't it? I'm not allergic to cats. I just don't like them. When I was younger, Bea told me that they're the devil's spawn. And I think she's right, as it happens. Some people don't like cats because they don't know what they're thinking. But I don't like cats because I know exactly what they're thinking. They're thinking, "Why don't we all get together and scrape out Tom's eyes in his sleep?" There's definitely something there. He's a lot slimmer. Fuck. Hi. Hey, Monk. How are you? Okay. Is Bea there? Well, she's sleeping. Um... it's pretty late here. Can I talk to her? No. She doesn't feel like talking. She's sleeping. Well, what's going on with you? Well, she's depressed. She lost her job at the bank. - Aw, shit. - Yeah. Sucks. Were you there when it happened? Yeah, I was there. Ugly. - Was it your fault? - No. - Was it? - No. Can I talk to Bea? No. Will you tell her that I'm really sorry that she lost her job? Yeah. I'm really not gonna talk to Bea? Is that what's-- I'm just gonna talk to you? She's sleeping, I said. Okay, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go. Sorry, Bea. 'Night. 'Night. You know, thanks to my father Al Senior, I got a wonderful education as a podiatrist. But a more important part of my education came when I was just 14. I went to Camp Weenahaha up in the Sierras there and we had Native American leaders come and teach us the old ways. Elders came and taught us things about... "kahee-na-ha," you know, whittling. We learned "poh-si-whoa" which is fire-starting, and... "yo-leven," which is Indian gaming. I can start a fire with a garlic press and some bear scat. I can make an old cigar humidor into a drum for signaling help. These are skills that I've honed over the years. And, you know, we need to think in those ways. There's gonna come a time, and I mean soon, when you'll turn on the lights and nothing will happen. I learned to not only operate, but to build a ham radio. So I'll communicate with my friends out there, like-minded people who know this is coming, and that's why I have the SUV with the high clearance to get over the barricades and get back home and help my wife and feed her and keep her warm. We're gonna need these skills, because the time is coming, and I mean-- I mean now. - You doing okay, Tom? - I'm doing great. - I am nailing this. - Oh, good. You know, I wanted to ask you-- so, the school you went to, was it like Hogwarts? Yeah, I bet it was. What was that like? Was it like-- did the teachers wear those hooded pointy hats like wizards wear? Yeah, no. Not so much. Did you save your outfit? I'd love to see it. Yeah, yeah, no. I like the movies and everything, but it wasn't really like that. Hey, can you just grab me a bowl when you get a sec? Whoa. Sorry. Oh! You found my products. That's okay. I was actually meaning to tell you that I have these products that I make. They're called "flushes" and they're like enemas. They come in all different flavors. - I'm working on more flavors, actually. - Oh. You know what? It would be great for you because it would help your jet lag, it would make you feel perky and energetic. - I feel pretty perky already. - They're fantastic. It's like an anal milkshake. - Why are they flavored? - It's interesting. There are tiny taste buds up inside your anus. - Shut up. - Yes. And if you don't like these, I've got a bubble gum, I've got a strawberry shortcake I'm working on. Some cookies and cream right up the-- I'll get that, actually. Great. Oh, I can't wait. This is gonna be great. Oh. Just-- We can come right in. I'm not worried about-- - Oh, hey. - Hi. - Tom. Yeah, hi. Rick. - Yes. - Rick! - Yes. - And, uh... - Julie. Julie. From Redondo Beach. - That's exactly right. - I've got it all up there. Yeah, you do. You've got it figured out. - Lovely to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. We brought you a little something. Actually, Julie made it. Yeah, it's just meats. It's a really good Lebanese dish. That sounds delicious. I'll bring that in. Actually, I'd like to hold on to this, if you don't mind. - She'll just carry it. - That's fine. Why don't you come through, hmm? - Yeah. - This is exciting. Welcome to Al's BBQ. We have some multicultural fare for you today for our friend who crossed the pond. We got our English bangers, Italian sausage, and we got the bratwurst, so a little bit from three countries. The size and the girth of that one there reminds me of sausages from Istanbul, I believe. It's called "sucuk" and it's mostly horse meat and cumin. And really spicy, really spicy. It would knock your socks off. Stuff like this would just be dull. I've seen those. You can see the marks on the side of the meat from when the jockey was whipping it. Yes, you would. Yes, you would. You know, my stepmother is Moldovan, so we have a lot of native sausage in the house in London. Yeah, it's really something. Full of flavor. - Uh-huh. - None of which are pleasant. The cheese is always the first to go. I know. Do you eat imported cheese? What do-- no. You mean from different countries? Yeah, like France or Italy or Ireland. I just look at the box, the color of my mood, the pictures. I don't read what it says. - Cheese is cheese. - No. Well, but it's not because-- Hello? - Is this the Chadwick house? - Yeah. - Hi. I'm Dave Chadwick. - Oh, hi, Dave. - I'm Kitty. - How are you? - It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you, too. Hey, Al, Dave's here. David. Welcome, welcome. Hey. How's it going? Nice to meet you live and in person. Ooh. Mm. You, sir, deliver a juicy sausage. There's nothing more exciting than a barbecue. So, uh... Dave, do you have a special lady in your life? Well, I did. - Ah. - Mm. - What? - It's a complicated story. - Right. - I have a couple of pictures. Oh. This one. Guadalupe is her name. She's very beautiful. Yeah, she's from Peru. That's why she's wearing that hat. Ah. They wear those all the-- I didn't know that. They do, yeah. That's us trick-or-treating on our street. - Really good. - Yeah. - Which one--? - I'm Stan Laurel. She's Hardy. Oliver Hardy, but she called herself Ola. She couldn't say Oliver for some reason. You made quite the couple. - Yeah. - But it didn't work out? She's missing. She went missing about three years ago. She's just missing? I don't know where she is, to be honest. That's terrible. I'm so sorry. I looked for her for about a year and a half, pretty solid, and then it started to kind of dwindle off. I had other things I was doing-- - you know, working, of course. - Yeah. So now, I'll be honest, I don't know where she is, but I'm kind of back to my regular routine. You guys got on-- it was a good relationship? Right. My part of the Chadwick family come from mostly North Carolina, but other places as well. Mostly what I know is about my grandfather Phineas, who was a musician and a collector of art. And he was also an actor and a baseball player. ♪ Spotted pup runnin' around the barn ♪ ♪ Spotted pup runnin' around the barn... ♪ He's a good banjo player, isn't he? Yeah, he's a good musician. He's got a nice voice, too. ♪ Where are you goin'? ♪ And that's the spotted pup song. - Nice. - Hey. - That was great. - Yeah. - That's a funny little piece there. - You look like him. I can see it. I can see it, yeah. A little bit, yeah, yeah. I have an interesting document here, which is a passenger list which shows Charles Chadwick going to England. - Can I take a look at that? - Yeah. Here. Let's see. Wow. Oh, yeah. So, he left for England on April 16, 1865. It's so weird that they would go to England. Yeah, you know, history at that time was just drinking and gambling. Maybe he had a big gambling debt and had to go. Or maybe he just didn't pay his taxes and he had to flee. - Well, that's possible. - Can I see that? Yes. I find this date of particular interest. April 16, 1865-- two days after Lincoln was shot. Whoa. Why would that be--? My great-granduncle Charles Chadwick has the resources to go over to England? - Where'd he get his funding? - Holy shit. Al, I don't know where he would get his funding. - I don't. - People just get jobs. He had a job, all right. It's widely known that Booth did not act alone; he had an accomplice. And the chatter over the telegraph at the time was that it was someone sympathetic to England. History doesn't show that at all, Al. - No one has ever claimed that there was a-- - Yes, it does. - Really? Okay. - Yes, it does. I hear music and the sound of laughter. Hi. How are you? I'm sorry I'm late. Listen, Kim is at home with a bad migraine. Migraines are very painful, particularly for me because that means there'll be no hanky-panky tonight. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be crude saying hanky-panky. But there's ladies present and I didn't wanna say "fuck." Oh, right. Look at me sitting in shorts. California. It's mad to think, you know, a couple of months ago, I didn't know that these people existed. And here we are just bonding. And I suppose it makes sense that we're connecting so quickly, because we're all part of this tree. This is what I'm getting as time goes on. I'm a part-- I'm a twig, a sheltered little Irish twig, and Al and Kitty are a high branch that have been in the sun too long. Rick's the trunk. Dave's a bit of gnarly bark. All connected. So the warden comes over and he says, "Bad news. Tonight's your night in the barrel." Gives a whole new meaning to "feeling your oats," huh? Ah! Hey, Al, is that a Wiffle ball set? - Is that yours? - It's our daughter's, actually. My gosh. Let's have a Wiffle ball game. What do you say? Everyone up for it? Yeah, I could do that. I'll do that. All right, everyone spread out in a semicircle. Dave, you set them up into position. - Where do you want to--? - Just stand out there. - Okay. - Okay. Help Tom. You show him, Al. - Can I play with a beer in my hand? - Absolutely, yeah. Just keep your head up. All right. All right, Tom, bend over and put your hands on your knees. Not the first time you've heard that, huh? All right, everyone ready? This is just a practice. It's a beautiful day for a Wiffle ball game. The weather is sunny with a 40% chance of a home run. - Ow! My gosh! - Oh! - Oh! - Kitty! You okay? - No! - What are you doing? - Careful with that. - Oh, my God. - I see a retina. - Put this on. - What's that? - It's some ice-cold lobster. - Lobster?! - This is from the ocean. - The shell is gonna cut her. - It stinks. - Get that out of here. - But it's nature. I need, like, a vegetable. Her retina's gonna detach. You've gotta hold that in. Here's a couple of shrimp. They're very dull. - No salt. - No, no, please. This is so nice. This is pleasant. Do you ever do this in London Town? No, I don't have a hot tub. Don't have the space. So much room here. - Yeah. - I love this. - Yeah. - Nice, isn't it? It's weird to think if things had gone slightly differently-- Edward had gone to Britain, Charles had stayed here-- this would be my hot tub. You'd be a podiatrist... playing "Kitty Kitty Bang Bang" here. - All right. - Oh! I don't hate the idea of that, Al. - With no accent. - Yeah. Well, I'd have an American accent. Well, that's not an accent. Dave? Wanna get some trunks and come on in? Dave, come join us. Come for a little dippy-dippy, Davey. Well, here's the thing. I have a vestigial tail. And if I get in the hot water, it's gonna inflame it, and you don't want that to happen. So probably best that I don't submerge it. You know, it's just a nubby little thing. It's like a knuckle, but it gets all red at the tip. Is that a-- is that a hereditary thing? It is, actually, yes. It doesn't run maybe in all parts of the Chadwicks, but it's-- in my case, I have to get one half size larger in pants because it protrudes. So thank you for the invite, but I shall go beddy-bye now. - Thank you. - Good night. All right. Nighty-night, cuz. I don't see a tail. It must be the fit of the pants. I couldn't see a thing. It's probably one like a Doberman pinscher kind that just is like-- Maybe they bobbed it like you bob a dog's tail. Right, and I bet he-- I wonder if he'd wag it. Sweetie, I'm getting tired. - I am, too. - You wanna hit it? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, I might just stay and look at the stars for a bit. - You stay. - I don't get to do this often. - Stay as long as you like. - Night-night. Thanks so much for today. Oh, sure. Good night. - Here you go, sweetie. - Thank you, thank you. - Hey, Tom. - Huh? Where is everybody? Um, they went to bed. Oh. Well, if the ladies have all retired, then in that case, looks like I don't need these.
