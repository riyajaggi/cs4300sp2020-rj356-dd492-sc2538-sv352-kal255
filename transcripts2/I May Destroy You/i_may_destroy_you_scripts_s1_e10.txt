Eh? - What you sayin', Dad? Nicholas, microwave? - Nicholas, how is school? - University? - Mm. - It's good. But it's been how many years now? - Six. I got one left. - Hope you are not spending all your studying time in the gym? - Oh, Kojo... - What is going on these days? - It's a part-time degree. - I've gotta work, innit. - He's doing very well. By 17, I was living by myself. You, you had moved out. - Mmm, yeah, I'm... - By 26, I didn't have muscles, - I had a house. - I'll be back. I wonder how much that house is worth now, eh? - Probably at least a million. That house was the spot. You were always at that house after school. - Yeah, 'cause Dad lived there. - Mm... And he was driving that orange car. Ooh, when Daddy was driving Mercedes-Benz! I was driving a Toyota! A specimen of a car! - Come on, better than a Benz. - Okay, Daddy. It wasn't orange. It was burnt clementine. You didn't see another guy driving a burnt clementine Toyota. It was my trademark. Only for those guys to come back the next day and steal it, eh. - Mmm. - Christ. - What? What was that? - Oh, they, uh... they stole the television, the speakers... Madam, listen, if you're going to say it, say it right, eh? I was driving my Toyota. I walked into my house. I was sad. Only the day before, I was victim to a cruel robbery. I looked around my empty house, I said, "God," eh? "What did I do to deserve this, huh? Why did you do this to me?" And then I heard a car engine. I say... I say, "I know that engine." It was my Toyota. Hey, Jesus. By the time I run to the door... ...it was gone. Yeah, um, the day before, when they robbed the whole house, Dad didn't realize they'd also robbed his second set of keys. - Ouch. - Mm-hmm. It's hard to start again, man. Impossible. You were only a baby. Yeah, you didn't come to that house much. No, he wasn't a "baby," I was 14, so he was like... Hmm, yeah. - They really must have followed you, eh? - Who? - Oh, Kojo, let's not. - What? You left the window open. Yeah, man! How else do you think they got in? I don't know how long you were entering the house like that. Oh no! - It was me? - Mm. It's okay, it's in the past now. The past is the past. So why are we talking about it? She asked me where the blame lies. - I'm just telling her. - Kojo! She was a child! Of course, of course, but I was sad, eh? What happened? To struggle in this country for decades, to lose everything in a matter of hours because of this wonderful tyrant. Who is the tyrant? - Okay, okay! - Um... Uh, one second, please. - He's looking. - Is he? Yes. Don't look for him, he'll think you're a slag. - Oh. - Walk straight. Bella, what you saying? You all right? Bruv, run, run! - Wait. What is happening? - If he sees you in your dutty school uniform for a second longer, it's over. You need to go to your dad's and change, bruv. If my dad sees me, I'm fucked. Hi, Daddy... Yeah, I'm fine. I was gonna come say hello, you home? Oh, it's a shame. That's a long time, till midnight? Nah, it's okay. I'll just go to Mummy. Ah, don't work too hard. Love you. When your parents ain't together, double yard, - that's sick! - No, they are together, they just never lived in the same place, you know? And I get to see him whenever I like, and I get to stay here sometimes. He ain't got no other family? Nah, I just got two yards, innit? So how come you ain't got a key? He's gonna cut one for me, he just keeps forgetting. Is your mom and dad married? Oi, Kevin is so buff. When I see him, I feel a pebble in my clit, bouncing off the upper left side, you know what I mean? What? Nothing. Have you got nice garms in your yard? - Yeah. - Okay, cool, 'cause if I'm struggling walking around as your friend, how's anyone gonna be your boyfriend? All right. And these things on your feet are testing our friendship. Tell me you got crep in the yard, too? Yeah. You need to hurry up, or Kevin's gonna be gone by the time you come back. Cool, cool. Double tap, yeah? Yeah. I thought you said he was at work? I was like, "Shit!" What happened? Mom. Are you okay? Yes, of course. It's my birthday, and I'm looking cute. Uh... Lenora, is she your friend? Yes, my dear. She was also your father's plaything. You don't care? I'm single and sexy, why should I care? All I care about is my children. - Mom? - Hmm? I have to tell you about something that happened to me in January. Okay. What happened? The most to me... I can feel the change... Does it need more sugar? What? The mojito? Oh, um... No. It's... it's perfect, it's... it's really nice. Way ahead of me... You're gorgeous. Thank you. When are you gonna do something about it? I cooked and made you a mojito. Yeah, thank you. What else you got for me? You mean my dick? Yeah, I mean your dick. We can... explore being sexual another day. Then why'd you follow through and make me come all the way here? I liked your pictures. You know, your profile says "Fun Now." Mojitos are fun, and now we have them. Stop fuckin' with me, you know what I mean. Oh. Okay, well, you're wasting my fucking time. So can you just see me out? 'Cause this... this is fucking weird. Is having a mojito weirder than instantly fucking? Sometimes, there's other stuff. Sit with me. And we'll think about what else. How long you been on Grindr? I want a hug. - Hi. - Hey, girl. - What's good? How was your audition? It was all right, you know. - Yeah? - Mmm. And your dad, did he turn up? Um, well... Hey, Kai. - Hmm? - She's here. Can I get you guys anything? Uh, yeah. - Your usual? - Yes, please. - And red? Glass of red? - Yeah. Can we get two glasses of red, please? Cool. All right. If there's anything else that you need, just let me know. Oh, the swag. Goddamn. Oh, yeah. So, did you dad turn up? - Um... - Oh, girl, I should've told you not to trust him. Nah, he... he... he did. He was a bit late, but... Oh, okay. I gave Simon his jacket back today. Hmm. What did he say? - I'm sorry. - You're amazing. Thank you for... being a really great friend and looking after me this past year, yeah. - Ooh. - Thank you. - Enjoy. Your birth is my birth, G. - Your death is my death. - Your death is my death. Sis, are you good? - Yeah, you? - Yeah, man. You gonna eat that? Are you okay, darling? - Do you want more food? - Oh, yes, please. Can we get more plantain? You this boy and your plantain, eh? - The book. - Amazing, Ben. Della Croy-Dickie. I need to meet her. She's like my twin. I wondered if you could maybe arrange a meeting for the two of us. Where's your draft? We've been waiting for quite a while now. I am in more debt than I've ever been in my whole life. What's on the menu tonight? Going to do your bar watch thing? Yeah. Hey, you wanna come?
