 I don't think she's enjoying this. I mean, it's not on the list. Does that mean it's not really self-care if it's not on the list? It's basically painting, and painting's on the list. - Kwame. - What? Look, I love that you're getting your inner Banksy on, yeah, but we're not here for ourselves, we're here for Arabella. - Seems fine to me. - She seems fine? If she's fine, then why is she on her phone? I dunno, maybe someone called her. Do you know what, let me break this shit down to you.

 You know how our nervous systems are like electric systems? You know, like when your laptop breaks down and most things shut down to, like, basic function and mode? - So, what, you need to borrow my laptop, or...? - No. I'm saying our nervous systems also shut down to safety mode when it's overloaded with too much stimulation, too much danger. #Trauma, #double-click for double rapist shit that she's been through. So, no, she's not fine. She's vacant. She's empty, she's a shell of herself, she's dying inside, but if you aren't looking for it, you ain't going to see it. Okay... Any suggestions? - For what? - For looking after our friend.

 What you doin'? The, uh, survivors group thing. Okay, cool. Kwame, get ready, let's go. Uh, it's for survivors only, so... - Is it? - Yeah. - What's the name of this group? - I don't think it has a name. - So how did you find it? - On socials, Facebook, I think. Okay. - What? - Is it, like, you know? - What? - Kosher. Halal. - What? - You need to be around people who affirm you. - Okay, just be careful and just... - I am. Do careful people meet with strangers from social networking apps? I mean, the king of Grindr here would say yes, but I propose no. It's Theo's group. - Who? - Theo. Theodora. - Theodora from school? - Yeah. She has what?! A support group. And where does she host that? In a halfway house? - I like her. We've been messaging. It's nice. - Bella. The poster girl for Childline can't help anyone in trauma. As your friend, I can't let you go. Hm. Stop being silly. My name is Theo Lee Daniels. I made this support group because I wanted people who've been through sexual exploitation of any kind to find each other, to bring wellbeing and to empower one another in a safe, abuse and oppression-free space. I hate abusers. I think that abuse, grooming, assault, domestic violence are the most vile, abhorrent qualities of our species. I've been abused, I've been exploited. One in every two women have and 89% of trials end in exoneration so I created this group for survivors to talk, to share common experiences and hopefully encourage one another. I know that I sound like a right icy bitch, but I'm lovely, I promise. So the floor is open, it's a conversation. Please don't name anybody. You never know, the creep in the office could be somebody's brother, so... ... in class we call every man Bob and every woman Barbara. The other day I was at a work party and Bob, co-worker, puts his hand on my knee. But really subtle, like. Mid conversation, we're just chatting away, not even flirting and he puts it there, and I felt weird. It's when they put their hand just on the small of your back. Does anyone report it? They ask you what happened. Then you try to define what happened. I hear myself out loud and start undermining myself. Yeah. Cos belittling your problems makes their lives a lot easier, doesn't it? - And these people get paid. - Exactly. And really, their jobs ain't supposed to be simple, so how dare they cut corners? Fucking pricks. I had a not great experience a drug-facilitated sexual assault and I was trying to get back on track and then someone from my workplace sexually assaulted me. Someone said it was my fault and maybe it was because twice, you know. I'm here to learn how to avoid being raped. There must be some way cos, if there isn't, that means that any time someone could just drag me into a bush and it would happen all over again. And I just... I don't know what kind of... ... world that would be. It's the kind of world where there are places like this that you can come and talk about it, and know that you're not alone. And that is the thing to focus on, okay? You are not alone. See you next week. See you later. Bye. See you later. - Bye! Have a great week. - Thank you. See you next time. - Thank you. - Bye. You are so fucking great. So are you, mate. You're fucking awesome. - There you go. - Thanks, babe. - Bye, babe. See you later. - Bye. See you. How you doing? Yeah. I like you so much more now we're wrinkly and fucked. - I, uh... - Any time you need me, yeah. I wish I got to know you more in school. Nah! We should start now. Yeah. Theo. Theo. - Theo. - What? Who's taking me to school? "Who's taking me?" What are you, the fucking queen? - What's in your hand? - It's got anything to do with you. - "Nothing" to do with you. - It's got nothing to do with you. I took this. It's Daddy's birthday. Martin's birthday, yeah. - Did you get him a present? - No. Why don't we use this as a present? - Yeah? - Yeah. Go and get me my school stuff, then. Go on! Someone's got to take the monster to school. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Martin... ♪ Daddy. ♪ Happy birthday, dear Daddy ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ Thank you. Whoa! Happy birthday, Martin. Thanks. You remembered. I'm off. - You haven't eaten. - Yeah, I'm late. Are you sure you're even going to make it? You must be tired, being out all night. You're never going to fool me. I swear to God, Mum, your insanity is actually fucking up my mornings now. I went bed, I slept and then I woke up in my bed. If I disappeared to have a fucking shit, I'm sorry. - You were wearing your clothes though. - What? You changed your clothes. Yes, I did change my clothes. Course I did. I'm not going to wear my PJs to school, am I? Jack, in fact, in fact, what did we do this morning? Did you see me in PJs this morning? Answer me yes or no so the idiot in the room understands. - Did you see me in my PJs? - Yeah. And then did you help me change out of my PJs into my uniform? - Yeah. - Passed me my tie, didn't you? Yeah. Done. Sort yourself out, Mum. Get some help. I'll take you tomorrow, yeah, yeah? Martin, happy birthday. You're wild, man, I love it. Ooh, whoa, whoa! What you doing? Stop. Stop. Ryan. - What? - Well, delete it. I won't share it, it's just for me. - All right, fine. - Are you dumb? What? You said delete it. - You're literally dumb. - I'm going to delete it. - I swear to God. - Are you still trying? - Delete my number, yeah? - I never saved it. Like I'm the only guy trying to make an archive in these streets. Coming at me like some psycho. What did he give you? - Is that how it works? - What? - He never said that. - Who? - He just said you liked that kind of shit. - Who? See, that's what I'm saying, probably bare man done it and you want to war me like... But Dylan didn't try and take pictures. So how do you know I was talking about Dylan then? I've seen it, so don't try it. I didn't take any good ones anyway. They're fucking shit. Your face ain't even in 'em. What if I... ... gave you a tenner? 20? 30 quid. Dylan, prick. Well, how much have you got? That's 11... - £11.50. - And what about in there? - That's all I've got. - Are you sure? Look, there's loads of little pockets. True... There's bare pockets. Sometimes this bag gets on my nerves. My mum got it from... ... Roman Road market. You know that one stall at the back? Any time she gets something it's always shit. No, after, after. All right, all right. Cool. Can I get a pic of you, like, bent over, like doggy? Yeah. And then like... ... like looking over, sort of thing. Argh! I'm going to come now, so... Yeah, I'm going to come. Oh... Oh. Mad. For real, though, I really like you. Yo! I found even more, like... ... 80, 85, 87. 90. 103. You're going to be rich after this. That's £21.03. Thanks, Ryan. Ta. Do you know what, yeah? For someone so pretty, I'm surprised Rochelle is so nice. Yeah, well, she's disabled. What? - Yeah, she ain't got no sense of smell. - What? Arabella, you're lying. No, I swear down, cos of her mum. She used to, like sniff crack and heroin when she was pregnant so, anosmia of the nose, it's a real thing. I actually thought you had that, you know. Why? Well, you can smell fried chicken from a mile away, but... ... you can't smell the BO coming from your own armpits. So a crotchet is what sort of minim? - Arabella? - Half. Good, and also twice as fast... Oi, Arabella? What are you eating? Popcorn, oi. - Feed mans. - Terry, enough. Good, and what about this? Who remembers what that is? Treble clef, and this is the bass clef. So treble bass. So, going back from the beginning we have minim, two beats. - Miss? - Yes, Terry. Theo? What's happened? Theo, talk to me. Ryan. I didn't want to. He made me. He had a knife. Er, Leslie, go and get the nurse right away. Dominic, get Mrs Tan. Run! This ain't got shit to do with me. Ryan, you've said you engaged in sexual activity? It was normal sex, I didn't hurt her. I didn't even want to hit it. Okay, I did but I wasn't going to force it, it wasn't that deep. You know what I mean? In fact, I'm the victim here. I think she jacked my phone, how come she ain't in here? She's been raped at knife-point is why, Ryan. She's with the medics, she was bleeding. What? No. The police are on the way. What? Sir, for me? To ask you if... Well, I don't know what they are going to, erm... Ryan. Sir, let me holler Marcus. Enough, Ryan, that's enough. Look, I have to keep you in this room until they get here. Please don't make that difficult for me. I'll be waiting on the other side of the door. Sir, can I talk to Marcus quickly? Mad ting. Mad. I saw it first. Rape. The remains of a rape right there, over man's shoulder and ting. All I can say is, I didn't know that boy could read and write, let alone rape and stab a bitch all at the same time. If he can manage that, what's the world coming to? Stay tuned to Terry TV for updates. End of programme. You know, I should actually do that. Terry TV would be sick. My days, a Halloween ting, like every year? Why Halloween? That's the only day they'll let anyone as butters as you come close to a camera, bruv. Wow. You lot know Ryan didn't do nothing, innit? The blood don't lie. The blood never lies, Marcus. - The shots don't lie. - What? Wait, I had to turn it off because... ... I ain't trying to bait things. Ryan sent me something, innit. I want a phone that takes photos, that's bad. A camera inside the phone, you know. Is it very expensive? Don't know, my dad sent it to me. All right, see, look. - Is that Theo? Bella? - Bro... - That was today. - You see what I'm saying? Wait. - She faked it? - She must have. The shots don't lie. The blood is the lie, do you know what I mean? The blood is the lie. And she's white. We could've done the exact same thing, all we'd get is detention. White girl tears have high currency. Mm-hm. Did you see Miss Mott? High alert, bro. She had tears in her eyes when she saw the blood. I thought I was the only one that saw that shit. I saw that! One moist eye duct! Meanwhile, I sneeze and Miss Mott is talking about I'm showing signs of intimidation. What kind of Catholic school is this? Can't even say bless you when a blackie sneeze? I swear down, if I cry, all Miss Mott would see is weapons of mass destruction leaking out of my eyeballs. Hey, remember Mr Merchant and Alisha? When she was crying! He dashed a book on her head. I was like, "What planet am I on?" She was out for like two seconds, I thought he'd killed her. Alisha got up like Jesus. Oh, my days. You shown Sir? No. They're going to arrest Ryan. There are too many pictures in this phone - police might arrest me for, innit? - What, yours? Unh-nuh. - Leeann? - No way. Skets be undercover. - Ryan's fucked. - No, Ryan was sloppy. - Can you send that pic to my phone? - Yeah. Cos the shots don't lie. The shots don't fucking lie. - The blood is the fucking lie. - The blood is the lie. - All right, safe. In a bit. - In a bit. Yes! Yeah? Oh... - Yes! - You lot saved me, man. This is the alliance! Ryan, any words, my brother? Speech! Speech, speech! Thank you for the support, innit. Got my sisters behind me, fam. Family, nothing's going to stop me. - I ride for you, bro. We ride for you. - We ride for you. - Do or die. Come what may. - All fucking day. We ride for you. - Done, though. - The alliance is spicy. Hey, can't let that shit happen for blood, you feel me? - Address the crowd. - No, fuck that! Another day being heroes, yeah? We just helped our brother escape from Babylon. Okay! Okay! You see, you see? Cos they all think they can chat shit and get away with it. But they can't. Do you know why? Why? Tell them why, T. - Tell them. - The alliance is realness. All fucking day. Hope you've got plasters. With your nonce dad. Fucking African monkeys. How you even see us? Three, two, one, go. Theo... Why? - I told you, I told you she was... - Yeah, yeah, we get it, Mary. You knew she was going wayward. What do you want? A job on the Weather Channel? After everything you went through with your dad. Don't talk about my dad. I'm sorry, but the way this goes is I care for you, yeah? You're in my care. So sometimes I'm going to say some things you don't want to hear. And I have to say... ... after you, yourself experienced something like that... ... to go through all the custody proceedings, your mum's told me how painful it was for you to say the disgusting things your dad did to you and your mum in front of all those people. Just to make it up, hurt an innocent kid... I can't under... My dad never touched me. Now he knows. What are you saying? What's she saying? Well, she wanted sole custody so she made me lie. No, I didn't, Theo. What? You told me to say shit that didn't happen. It's... I was seven. I was seven. What is she saying? I'm saying your wife is a mastermind liar. She said he was smacking her about. Not that I ever saw a bruise on her. I mean, the only thing I remember is he was a lot poorer than you and you don't do fuck all, Mum. You've come in handy is all I'm saying. That is not how it went. When you're seven, you don't know what to believe. So, when you told me to say all that, I just said it. Turned me into something else, Mum. Sorry for all this, Martin. I think you're great, I do. I like you and all that, I just miss my... My name is Theo Lee Daniels. I made the support group because I wanted people who've experienced sexual exploitation of any kind to find each other, to bring wellbeing and to empower one another in a safe, abuse and oppression-free space. I hate abusers. I think that abuse, assault, grooming, domestic violence are the most abhorrent, vile qualities of our species. I've been abused, I've been exploited, one in every two women have, and 89% of trials end in exoneration. So I created this group for survivors to talk, to share common experiences and, hopefully, encourage one another. I know that I sound like a right icy bitch, but I'm lovely, I promise. So, a lot of messages this week...
