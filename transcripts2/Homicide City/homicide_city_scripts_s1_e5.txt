 THEY WERE BEST BUDDIES. GOOD MORNING, LADIES. GOOD MORNING, BABY. HOW WAS WORK? IT WAS THE NIGHT SHIFT. WHAT CAN I SAY? I WOULD DESCRIBE JAMES AS A SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN. THAT'S WHO HE WAS. ALREADY DRAWING, HUH? Man: I MEAN, THESE WERE GOOD, DECENT PEOPLE. NONE HAD BAGGAGE. THEY WERE HARDWORKING. YOU WORK AGAIN TONIGHT? YEAH. TRY TO CATCH A NAP THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE I HEAD IN TONIGHT. NIKKI, BABY, I'M GOING TO BE LATE

 SO WHY DON'T YOU PICK UP SOME PIZZA, AND SAVE ME A PIECE? I'M GOING TO BE HUNGRY. Man: A CRIME LIKE THIS, THEY'RE TOUGH. THIS FAMILY DID NOT BRING TROUBLE TO THEIR DOOR. IT CAME TO THEIR DOOR. ** ** ** ** [ RADIO CHATTER ] ** ** YOU CALL FOR THE POLICE? YEAH, THAT'S ME. IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING, BUT I DON'T KNOW. Woman: THE FIRST THING THAT ANYBODY KNEW WAS WRONG WAS THAT JAMES DID NOT SHOW UP FOR WORK FOR HIS OVERNIGHT SHIFT AT THE SOUTH JERSEY PAPER FACTORY, AND SO HIS FRIEND, TONY MATOS, WENT TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. SO THERE ARE THREE PEOPLE LIVING IN HERE? YEAH, THERE'S THREE PEOPLE THERE. THERE'S JAMES, WHO I WORK WITH, HIS GIRLFRIEND PATRICIA, AND PATRICIA'S DAUGHTER NIKKI. HE DISCOVERED THAT THE BACKDOOR WAS NOT ONLY UNLOCKED, BUT IT WAS OPEN, AND THAT CONCERNED HIM. HE DIDN'T GO INSIDE, BUT HE DECIDED THAT WAS WORTH ALERTING THE POLICE. AND HER CAR IS HERE, TOO, WHICH IS WEIRD. ALL RIGHT. JUST STAY PUT FOR ME. ALL RIGHT. ** ** PHILADELPHIA POLICE. HELLO? ** ** Man: THE OFFICER GAINED ENTRY TO THE PROPERTY THROUGH A BASEMENT LEVEL, DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING UNUSUAL, WENT UP A SET OF STEPS INTO A MAIN LIVING AREA. ** PHILADELPHIA POLICE! ANYONE HERE? ** ** PHILADELPHIA POLICE. IF THERE'S ANYBODY HERE, COME OUT RIGHT NOW. ** ** Man: RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS HE MAKES A GRUESOME DISCOVERY OF A FEMALE BODY LAYING FACE DOWN, PARTIALLY COVERED WITH A BLANKET. ONE-12 TO DISPATCH, REQUESTING ADDITIONAL UNITS AT 5400 BLOCK OF BINGHAM ROAD. ONE DECEASED ON SCENE, FEMALE. ** PHILADELPHIA POLICE! ANYONE HERE? ** ** Man: AND THEN IN ONE OF THEIR BEDROOMS, THEY DISCOVERED A BODY OF A MALE STILL LYING IN BED WITH A BLANKET OVER THE BODY. DISPATCH, THERE'S TWO DECEASED ON SCENE. TWO VICTIMS ON SCENE, DO YOU COPY THAT? Narrator: THE REPORT OF TWO DEAD BODIES ALERTS PHILADELPHIA HOMICIDE TO THE CRIME SCENE IN THE CITY'S CRESCENTVILLE SECTION. SERGEANT ROBERT KUHLMEIER IS SUPERVISING DETECTIVE ON THE CASE. - YOU FOUND THEM? - YES, SIR. I DID. - LEAD THE WAY. Man: I ARRIVED SHORTLY AFTER DETECTIVES THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO GO TO THE CRIME SCENE. THE CRESCENTVILLE NEIGHBORHOOD IS A RELATIVELY SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD, BASICALLY BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS. IT'S RARE YOU WOULD SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. FOUND THE FEMALE FIRST. THE WOMAN THAT WAS FOUND UPSTAIRS ON THE SECOND-FLOOR LANDING WAS THE DAUGHTER, NIKKI STALLWORTH. ONE SHOT TO THE HEAD, ALMOST POINT-BLANK. THE MALE IS IN THE BEDROOM BACK THERE. IN THE FRONT BEDROOM, PATRICIA HENRY'S BOYFRIEND, JAMES COFER, WAS FOUND IN THE BED. THERE'S BLOOD COMING FROM THE HEAD AREA OF BOTH VICTIMS. THE BODIES WERE COVERED IN EITHER A BLANKET OR A QUILT, EITHER CONCEALED THE FACE OR, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE BODY. HIS FACE WAS COVERED WHEN YOU GOT HERE? BOTH OF THEM WERE. WHY DO YOU THINK HE COVERED THEM? WHAT DO YOU THINK? THE DUDE WAS TRYING TO CONCEAL THEM? OR THEY KNEW HIM. LET'S GET TO WORK. Kuhlmeier: WHEN YOU HAVE A MURDER INSIDE A RESIDENCE, WE'RE AUTOMATICALLY THINKING IT'S A FAMILY MEMBER. IT'S A CRIME OF PASSION. IS THERE SOMEONE IN PARTICULAR IN THE FAMILY THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT WOULD HAVE AN ANSWER AS TO WHAT HAPPENED? Narrator: SERGEANT KUHLMEIER IS JOINED BY SERGEANT BILL BRITT FROM PHILLY PD FUGITIVE TASK FORCE. ROBBERY? DOESN'T LOOK THAT WAY. THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE A TV MISSING, A RADIO MISSING OR ANY DRAWERS THAT WERE GONE THROUGH AND DUMPED OUT. Narrator: WITH NO CLEAR MOTIVE, INVESTIGATORS TURN TO THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE LEFT ON SCENE FOR CLUES TO WHAT MAY HAVE TRANSPIRED. THERE WERE SOME ITEMS THAT APPEARED TO BE OUT OF PLACE, SOME DRINK CONTAINERS, SOME FOOD CONTAINERS THAT WERE LEFT OUT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? THE GIRL WAS DOWN HERE EATING PIZZA. SHE RESPONDS TO THE DOER AT THE DOOR WHO FORCES HIS WAY IN AND TAKES HER UPSTAIRS TOWARD THE BEDROOMS. WE GOT ANOTHER SODA CAN IN THE KITCHEN. I WANT THIS WHOLE PLACE DUSTED AND PRESERVED. EVERYTHING HERE IS EVIDENCE. NOW, THE FOCUS WITH THE CRIME SCENE UNIT IS, HEY, LET'S LOOK AT THESE DRINK CONTAINERS. AT THAT POINT, I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ITEMS GET TO THE FINGERPRINT EXPERT TO HAVE THEM CONDUCT THEIR TEST. Narrator: WHILE POLICE CONTINUE TO PROCESS THE SCENE, WORRIED RELATIVES BEGIN TO GATHER. DETECTIVES ARE ANXIOUS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHO THEIR VICTIMS ARE. DID ANYONE TALK TO THE FAMILY YET? NO, NOT YET. IT'S THE TWO WOMEN OVER THERE. WE HAVE TO NOW GO OUT TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE GATHERED OUTSIDE AND MAKE OUR NOTIFICATION. MA'AM? WOULD YOU GUYS MIND STEPPING BACK FOR A MINUTE? THANK YOU. WHAT'S GOING ON? I'M SERGEANT ROBERT KUHLMEIER. DO YOU HAVE RELATIVES THAT LIVE AT THIS RESIDENCE? YES. IT WASN'T LONG AFTER MY GETTING OUT THE CAR THAT THEY TELL ME THAT THEY HAD FOUND TWO BODIES IN THE HOUSE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN "BODIES"?! WHAT'S GOING ON? WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE. WE FOUND A MAN AND A TEENAGE FEMALE. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. Marilyn: AFTER I WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD FOUND THE TWO BODIES, AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS THREE OF THEM IN THE HOUSE, MY CONCERN WAS NOW, WHERE WAS MY SISTER, PAT. EAT UP. Man: OH, LOOK AT THAT! VEGGIE BURGERS ON THE GRILL. Narrator: PATRICIA HENRY AND HER DAUGHTER, NIKKI, HAD LIVED IN THE CRESCENTVILLE HOME FOR A DECADE. PATRICIA'S BOYFRIEND, JAMES, HAD MOVED IN ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE. IT WAS, APPARENTLY, A HAPPY HOUSEHOLD. MY SISTER, PAT, SHE WAS A WIDOW AT A YOUNG AGE. PAT HAD TO RAISE MY NIECE, NIKKI, HER DAUGHTER. JAMES, YOU BETTER NOT BE OVERCOOKING MY BURGER. YOU BETTER MAKE MINE A DOUBLE. PHYLLIS, I'LL MAKE YOU ANYTHING YOUR HEART DESIRES. Phyllis: A FEW YEARS LATER, SHE MET JAMES. THEY MET ON A CRUISE FOR MY SISTER PAT'S 49TH BIRTHDAY. PAT AND JAMES HIT IT OFF REALLY WELL, AND JAMES GOT ALONG WITH NIKKI. THEY JUST CLICKED RIGHT AWAY. Marilyn: THE FIRST TIME I MET JAMES WAS AT A FOURTH OF JULY EVENT. IT WAS AS IF I HAD KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS BECAUSE HE JUST FIT RIGHT IN WITH THE FAMILY. Phyllis: ALL THREE SEEMED TO WANT THIS RELATIONSHIP. THEY WERE A FAMILY. Narrator: PATRICIA HENRY'S WHEREABOUTS ARE NOW A MYSTERY. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE YOUR SISTER MAY HAVE GONE? HER CAR IS THERE. OKAY? I SAW IT. SHE WOULDN'T JUST TAKE OFF. I DIDN'T KNOW AT THAT POINT IF SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN AGAINST HER WILL. I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER. HAVE YOU TRIED CONTACTING HER OR CALLING HER CELL? I KEEP CALLING AND CALLING. I GET NO ANSWER. WE REALIZE PATRICIA IS NOT IN THE UPSTAIRS SECOND FLOOR. PATRICIA'S CAR WAS IN THE REAR OF THE PROPERTY. WHERE IS PATRICIA? Narrator: WITH NO OTHER CLUES, DETECTIVES FOCUSED THEIR ATTENTION BACK INTO THE HOME. THEN THEY FIND SOMETHING. Man [on radio]: SARGE, YOU ON THE AIR? YEAH, GO 'HEAD. YEAH, WE NEED YOU IN THE BASEMENT. ** ** [ RADIO CHATTER ] Narrator: HOURS AFTER FINDING THE BODIES OF 15-YEAR-OLD NIKKI STALLWORTH AND HER MOTHER'S PARTNER, JAMES COFER, GUNNED DOWN IN THEIR PHILADELPHIA ROW HOUSE, DETECTIVES ARE SEARCHING FOR PATRICIA HENRY, NIKKI'S MOTHER, WHO IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. Man: WE'RE NOT SURE WHETHER THAT INDIVIDUAL IS A SUSPECT, OR WHERE IS THAT INDIVIDUAL? WE NOW HAVE NIKKI AND JAMES UPSTAIRS. WE NEED TO FIND PATRICIA. Narrator: AS THE CROWD OF MOURNERS GROW, POLICE INTENSIFY THEIR SEARCH FOR PATRICIA'S WHEREABOUTS, AND THEY FIND SOMETHING. Kuhlmeier: WE START CONDUCTING MORE EXTENSIVE SEARCH OF THE HOME, AND THERE WAS ONE PARTICULAR AREA IN THE HOME THAT REALLY WASN'T LOOKED DEEPLY INTO, AND IT WAS IN THE BASEMENT. RIGHT HERE, DETECTIVES. WE HAD TO REMOVE THE PILES OF CLOTHING, AND WE DISCOVERED AN AREA RUG THAT WAS ROLLED UP. AT THAT POINT, WE DISCOVERED PATRICIA HENRY. ** SHOT JUST LIKE JAMES AND NIKKI. WENT THROUGH A LOT OF TROUBLE TO HIDE HER, MAKING HER DISAPPEAR. THEY ROLLED HER UP IN THE CARPET, PUT HER BEHIND A CURTAIN UNDER SOME CLOTHES. CONSISTENT WITH THE TWO UPSTAIRS. YEAH, BUT HE WRAPPED HER UP. MAYBE HE JUST DIDN'T WANT HER TO BE FOUND AT ALL. Narrator: FOR INVESTIGATORS, FINDING PATRICIA HENRY'S BODY COVERED JUST LIKE JAMES AND NIKKI'S UPSTAIRS LENDS CREDENCE TO THE THEORY THAT THE KILLER COULD BE SOMEONE THE FAMILY KNEW. Man: WHEN YOU'RE INVESTIGATING A CRIME SCENE AND YOU SEE A BODY COVERED, SOMETIMES THAT'S AN INDICATION OF THEY KNEW THEM, OR THERE'S SOME TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP WHERE THEY COVER BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE WHAT THEY DID. Woman: AND THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE KILLER SOMEHOW HAD REMORSE OR WAS UPSET ABOUT WHAT THEY HAD DONE, WHICH IS TYPICAL IN CASES WHERE THE KILLER KNOWS THE VICTIMS. WANNA GRAB HAVE AN OFFICER AND START KNOCKING ON DOORS? SOMEONE MUST HAVE SEEN SOMETHING. AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE, THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THERE WAS REALLY A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS TAKEN. WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW THE PERSON GOT IN, WHO THEY WERE, SO WE WEREN'T SURE WHAT WE WERE DEALING WITH YET. Narrator: NOW, WITH A CONFIRMED THIRD VICTIM AND STILL NO CLEAR MOTIVE, SERGEANT KUHLMEIER REJOINS PATRICIA'S SISTERS TO GIVE THEM THE NEWS. SO I'M VERY SORRY TO HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS. WE FOUND YOUR SISTER INSIDE THE HOUSE ALSO DECEASED. - NO. - OH, GOD. Woman: IT WAS JUST SHOCKING TO THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD. ALL OUR FRIENDS, THEY WOULD, "THAT'S NOT OUR PAT, IS IT? THAT'S NOT OUR PATRICIA. TELL ME THAT'S NOT OUR PATRICIA." I'M AFRAID I NEED TO ASK YOU SOME HARD QUESTIONS, AND I KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY, BUT YOUR ANSWERS COULD HELP US FIND WHO DID THIS. SURE, BUT GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD. WAS PAT, OR NIKKI FOR THAT MATTER, INVOLVED WITH SOMEONE? SOMEONE JAMES DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT? NO. THE DETECTIVES ASKED ME, DID I KNOW ANYONE THAT WOULD DO THIS OR ANY REASON FOR DOING THIS, AND, I MEAN, I COULD NOT THINK OF ANYONE THAT WOULD HARM THEM THAT WAY. I MEAN, THEY DID NOT HANG OUT WITH PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, THAT WERE CRIMINALS. Narrator: AS SERGEANT KUHLMEIER GRILLS THE FAMILY FOR INFORMATION, DETECTIVES FAN OUT ACROSS THE CRESCENTVILLE NEIGHBORHOOD IN SEARCH OF ANY WITNESSES. SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE SEEN HER WALKING OR ANY OF THEM WALKING WITH SOMEONE TO THE HOUSE, SAW SOMEBODY KNOCKING ON THE DOOR, ANYTHING LIKE THAT, THAT WOULD GIVE YOU A STARTING POINT. EXCUSE ME? YES? I'M WITH THE PHILADELPHIA POLICE. YOU GOT A MINUTE FOR A QUESTION OR TWO ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBORS, PAT, NIKKI AND JAMES? YEAH, I HEARD. I'M STILL IN SHOCK. DID YOU HEAR OR SEE ANYTHING UNUSUAL LAST NIGHT? NO, NOTHING THAT I CAN THINK OF. NO ONE COMING OR GOING THAT SEEMED LIKE THEY DIDN'T BELONG? WELL, NO, NOT THAT DAY, BUT THERE IS ONE GUY THAT COMES AROUND. WHAT ABOUT EXES? AFTER PAT'S HUSBAND DIED, DID SHE DATE ANYONE BEFORE JAMES? WELL, THERE WAS ONE GUY, JOHN, BUT IT WAS BRIEF, YOU KNOW? THEY MET AT WORK. THEY STILL KEEP IN TOUCH, AS FAR AS I KNOW. Woman: SHE WORKED WITH A LOT OF MALE COUNSELORS, AND PAT, BEING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, JOHN, ONE OF THE COUNSELORS THERE, SHOWED AN INTEREST IN HER. YEAH, JOHN. OH, HE COMES AND GOES. HE GETS HIS MAIL THERE, I THINK. I SEE HIM. I WAVE. HE WAVES. COMES AND GOES AS IN CURRENTLY? YEAH. I GUESS THAT COULD BE WEIRD, HUH? I MEAN, WITH JAMES AND ALL. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY WEIRD? WELL JAMES IS THE CURRENT BOYFRIEND, AND HE'S THE EX-BOYFRIEND COMING AROUND LIKE THAT. THAT'S WEIRD. PAT HAD AN EX-BOYFRIEND, AND NEIGHBORS SAID THAT THEY HAD SEEN HIM OCCASIONALLY COMING TO THE PROPERTY AND LETTING HIMSELF IN WITH A KEY. THAT WOULD BE CAUSE FOR CONCERN BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FORCED ENTRY. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW THEM AT THE HOUSE? I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, IT WASN'T SOMETHING I PAID THAT CLOSE ATTENTION TO. THE EX-BOYFRIEND STILL COMING AROUND TO THE HOUSE, AND PATRICIA'S INVOLVED IN ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP, IS THERE A JEALOUSY THING WITH THE EX-BOYFRIEND AND THE NEW BOYFRIEND? DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW JOHN'S LAST NAME BY ANY CHANCE? OF COURSE I KNOW IT. IT'S BOSTON, JOHN BOSTON. YOU HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THAT POSSIBILITY THAT, WAS THERE A PROBLEM BETWEEN THOSE TWO OVER MONEY, OVER RELATIONSHIP, OVER ANYTHING? BUT THE FACT THAT HE COULD LET HIMSELF INTO THAT PROPERTY IS SUSPICIOUS. Narrator: DETECTIVES TRACK DOWN JOHN BOSTON'S LAST KNOWN ADDRESS. SERGEANT BRITT AND DETECTIVE JIM BURKE FROM PHILLY PD'S FUGITIVE SQUAD MEET WITH BOSTON'S LANDLORD IN FRONT OF HIS HOME. HOW ARE YOU DOING? GOOD MORNING. SO WE WERE JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND KNOCK ON THE DOOR, SEE WHAT'S WHAT. IF WE DON'T GET AN ANSWER, GO AHEAD AND UNLOCK THE DOOR. YOU GOT IT. WHY IS HE CONTINUING TO COME BACK TO PATRICIA HENRY'S HOME WHEN PATRICIA IS INVOLVED IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP? JOHN BOSTON, PHILADELPHIA POLICE. COME TO THE DOOR. EVERY TIME YOU GO OUT, SUSPECT, LOCATING A WITNESS, OR AFTER A HOMICIDE FUGITIVE, YOU ALWAYS GO THE SAME WAY. ALWAYS BE PREPARED FOR WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IS GOING TO HAPPEN. JOHN BOSTON, COME TO THE DOOR. SARGE, DO YOU SMELL THAT? SURE DO. WE DID KNOCK. WE WEREN'T GETTING ANSWERS. WE COULD SMELL A FOUL ODOR COMING FROM THE RESIDENCE... IT SMELLS LIKE A DEAD BODY. SO WE WANTED TO GAIN ACCESS TO SEE IF HE WAS IN THERE, DEAD OR ALIVE. MR. JOHN BOSTON, COME TO THE DOOR. ALL RIGHT. UNLOCK IT. YOU GOT IT. ** ** ** LET'S START LOOKING AROUND. EVEN WHEN IT'S AN EMPTY HOUSE, YOU'RE APPREHENSIVE. YOU KNOW, YOUR WEAPON IS DRAWN. YOU'RE GOING SLOWLY, AND YOU DON'T WANT ANYBODY SNEAKING UP BEHIND YOU. ** ** WE FOUND HIS RESIDENCE IN DISARRAY WHICH PIQUED OUR INTEREST. ** ** HE'S NOT HERE. WE REALIZED IT WASN'T WHAT WE THOUGHT, THAT THE FOUL ODOR WAS COMING FROM SOMETHING OTHER THAN A DEAD CORPSE. DID HE DISAPPEAR? DID HE TAKE OFF? IS HE A FLIGHT, YOU KNOW, A FUGITIVE? IS HE RUNNING AWAY? IS HE RESPONSIBLE? LIKE, WE REALLY NEED TO FIND WHERE HE IS. ** ** Narrator: POLICE INVESTIGATING A TRIPLE MURDER IN PHILADELPHIA'S CRESCENTVILLE NEIGHBORHOOD ARE LOOKING FOR VICTIM PATRICIA HENRY'S EX-BOYFRIEND, JOHN BOSTON. NEIGHBORS HAD SEEN BOSTON COMING AND GOING FROM PATRICIA'S HOUSE EVEN AFTER THEY SPLIT UP. DETECTIVES CHECK HIS RESIDENCE, BUT HE'S NOT THERE. Man: FROM WHAT THEY COULD SEE, THINGS LOOKED IN DISARRAY. THINGS DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT. WE COULD NOT LOCATE HIM, AND NOW YOU'RE WONDERING, "DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HIM OR DID HE JUST NOT WANT TO BE FOUND?" Narrator: WHEN DETECTIVES SPEAK WITH NEIGHBORS, THEY LEARN THAT BOSTON IS NO LONGER IN THE HOME BUT IN THE HOSPITAL. ** ** MR. BOSTON? YES, THAT'S ME. SERGEANT KUHLMEIER, PHILADELPHIA HOMICIDE. I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE, PATRICIA AND HER DAUGHTER. I WENT BY YOUR PLACE. YOUR NEIGHBOR TOLD US YOU WERE HERE. IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASK, WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR? I HAD A STROKE, GOT TO GET MY ENERGY BACK BEFORE I CAN GO BACK HOME. Man: HE WAS REHABBING FROM THE STROKE AND WAS PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO GET AROUND. SO YOU HEARD WHAT HAPPENED? LISTEN, PAT AND NIKKI ARE GOOD PEOPLE. I LOVE PATRICIA... EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T EXACTLY A PERFECT MATCH. SHE WAS, UM... [ CHUCKLES ] OUT OF MY LEAGUE. JOHN COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH PAT. HE WAS OLDER, AND HE WAS SICKLY. NO HARD FEELINGS, HER LEAVING YOU LIKE THAT? I KNOW YOU HAVE TO ASK BUT NO. NO. THERE SEEMED TO BE NO FORCED ENTRY AT THE REAR DOOR, AND THAT COMBINED WITH THE INFORMATION WE WERE GETTING THAT PATRICIA HENRY'S EX-BOYFRIEND WOULD COME TO THE HOUSE TO PICK UP MAIL LEAVES US TO BELIEVE THAT HE POSSESSED A KEY. YOU STILL HAVE A KEY TO HER PLACE, RIGHT? YOU COULD COME AND GO AS YOU WANT. HAD A KEY, SO I COULD PICK UP MY MAIL. I GAVE IT BACK TO HER. I DON'T HOLD A GRUDGE, NEVER HAVE, AND EVEN IF I DID, WHAT COULD I DO? I WAS HERE WHEN IT HAPPENED, SAW IT ON TELEVISION. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS CONFIRMED THAT BOSTON WAS, INDEED, IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN THE KILLER STRUCK. AND WE DETERMINED THAT HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL DURING THE MURDER. THEREFORE, HE WAS ELIMINATED AS A SUSPECT. WELL, THANKS FOR YOUR TIME, SIR. HERE'S MY CARD. KEEP IT. IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HELP US, CALL ME. ** Narrator: AFTER SPEAKING WITH JOHN BOSTON AND LEARNING MORE ABOUT PATRICIA'S LIFE, DETECTIVES BEGAN TO QUESTION WHETHER PATRICIA HENRY WAS ACTUALLY THE INTENDED TARGET. Man: THE EX-BOYFRIEND REVEALED TO US THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT PATRICIA AND HE BROKE UP WAS HE WASN'T PARTICULARLY CLEAN AND NEAT. Narrator: REFLECTING BACK TO THE CRIME SCENE, DETECTIVES RECALL THE PIZZA LEFT OUT IN THE LIVING ROOM. Man: IF PATRICIA WAS HOME AT THE TIME, THOSE ITEMS WOULD HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP AND PUT AWAY. BASED ON THE INFORMATION FROM PATRICIA'S EX-BOYFRIEND, LET'S FOCUS BACK ON NIKKI. DID NIKKI INVITE SOMEONE IN TO THE PROPERTY, AND IF SO, WHO WOULD THAT BE? Narrator: DETECTIVES GO TO THE PERFORMING ARTS HIGH SCHOOL THAT NIKKI ATTENDED TO SPEAK TO HER FRIENDS. SO, YOU GUYS, DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHO DID IT? NOT YET, BUT WE WILL. I PROMISE YOU THAT. SHE WAS A SOPHOMORE HONORS STUDENT AT THE PHILADELPHIA HIGH SCHOOL FOR CREATIVE AND PERFORMING ARTS. SHE WAS JUST A GREAT STUDENT. NO ONE HAD ANYTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT HER. SHE WAS SO TALENTED. SHE WON SO MANY AWARDS THAT SHE WAS BASICALLY TEACHING THE ART CLASS. WE FIND OUT THAT SHE'S A GIFTED STUDENT. SHE'S GOING TO A GIFTED SCHOOL AND THAT SHE'S A STRAIGHT-A STUDENT. DID NIKKI HAVE TROUBLE WITH ANYONE? SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE GIRLS. SHE GOT ALONG WITH EVERYONE, YOU KNOW? SHE WAS INDEPENDENT. SHE HAD A SINGLE MOM WHO WORKED ALL THE TIME AND COULD TAKE CARE OF HERSELF. EVERY SCHOOL HAS ITS BAD KIDS. DID SHE EVER HANG WITH THEM? THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF SCHOOL. EVERYONE HERE WORKED HARD TO GET HERE, BUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SHE LEFT HERE, I DON'T KNOW. Man: NIKKI, YOU KNOW, DIDN'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND. IT DIDN'T APPEAR THAT SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND THAT WAS IN THE CRIMINAL WORLD. ** Narrator: DETECTIVES DIG DEEPER INTO NIKKI'S LIFE AND FIND NO DARK SECRETS. Man: THERE WAS NO ISSUES AND NO PROBLEMS IN NIKKI'S LIFE. WE WERE KIND OF PERPLEXED AS TO WHERE ELSE TO GO. Narrator: AND AS THEY CHECK INTO PATRICIA'S BOYFRIEND, JAMES COFER'S BACKGROUND, THEY FIND SIMILAR RESULTS. MN: WE DO A COMPUTER CHECK TO SEE, WAS JAMES EVER ARRESTED? IS HE GAMBLING? IS HE TAKING DRUGS THAT ANYONE'S AWARE OF, AND DOES HE HAVE A DRUG DEBT? ONCE AGAIN, NEGATIVE. JAMES, WE DETERMINED, WAS A GOOD PERSON. STRAIGHT-A STUDENT, HARDWORKING MOTHER AND HER STRAIGHT-ARROW BOYFRIEND, I GUESS YOU COULD CALL THEM ATYPICAL VICTIMS. Man: WE COULD FIND NOTHING IN EITHER ONE'S PAST THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH ANYBODY WHO WOULD BE CAPABLE OF THESE ACTS. ** THEY NEVER SAW THIS COMING. YEAH, MAYBE THAT'S THE POINT. IT WAS AT THIS POINT, WE'RE GIVING SERIOUS THOUGHT. WHAT IF THIS WAS A STRANGER THAT CAME INTO THE BINGHAM STREET HOUSE AND WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MURDERING THREE FAMILY MEMBERS? Narrator: IT'S AN UNSETTLING BUT REAL POSSIBILITY. INVESTIGATORS MUST NOW CONSIDER IF THE MURDERS OF PATRICIA, JAMES AND NIKKI ARE TIED TO A STRING OF OTHER HOMICIDES IN PHILADELPHIA. THERE WERE SEVERAL MURDERS IN WHICH THERE ARE MULTIPLE VICTIMS. THESE WERE FAMILIES THAT WERE KILLED IN THEIR HOMES, AND THE PUBLIC WAS CONCERNED THAT THEY WERE LINKED. YOU BETTER BELIEVE WE'RE STARTING TO WORRY BECAUSE NOW WE DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE A SERIAL KILLER. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. WE DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO STOP THIS, AND WE HAVE TO STOP IT QUICK. ** Narrator: PHILADELPHIA POLICE ARE TRYING TO CATCH THE KILLER WHO GUNNED DOWN PATRICIA HENRY, HER DAUGHTER, NIKKI, AND PATRICIA'S BOYFRIEND, JAMES COFER. NOW, POLICE ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER THEIR DEATHS ARE A PART OF A SERIES OF MURDERS OF UPSTANDING FAMILIES THROUGHOUT PHILADELPHIA. ROBERT. BILL. THERE WERE MURDERS THAT HAD MULTIPLE VICTIMS THAT WERE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE CRESCENTVILLE KILLINGS. THEY WERE INNOCENT VICTIMS THAT WERE KILLED IN THEIR HOME. TWO COUPLES, ALMOST THE SAME PROFILE AS PAT, NIKKI AND JAMES, ALL SHOT AT HOME. Narrator: BOTH MURDERS HAPPENED WITHIN 10 MILES OF PATRICIA HENRY'S RESIDENCE, ROUGHLY 4 MONTHS EARLIER. WE WENT OVER THE CASE FILES FOR ALL THREE, AND, YOU KNOW, SOME OF IT FITS, AND SOME OF IT'S JUST TOO EARLY TO SAY. WE LOOKED FOR A THING CALLED COMMON THEME AND DESIGN. HOW WAS ENTRANCE GAINED? WHERE WERE THE PEOPLE FOUND? HOW WERE THE PEOPLE FOUND? DO THEY WORK TOGETHER? WAS THERE SOME SORT OF COMMON THREAD THAT WOULD TIE THE TWO OF THEM IN? IN THE OTHER HOMICIDES THERE WAS NO FORCED ENTRY. JUST LIKE AT PAT'S HOUSE. BEFORE YOU ASK, THERE WERE NO EYE WITNESSES. HE GETS IN AND OUT, AND NOBODY SEES HIM. IT SEEMS SO. Woman: THE PUBLIC WONDERED IF THEY WERE LINKED, AND THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS AND FEARS, YOU KNOW, AMONG THE PEOPLE OF PHILADELPHIA THAT, YOU KNOW, DO WE HAVE A SERIAL KILLER AT WORK? Narrator: AS INVESTIGATORS CONSIDER WHETHER THESE CASES COULD HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY THE SAME KILLER, THEY CATCH A BREAK. GENTLEMEN, I HAVE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. RIGHT THERE IS THE FINGERPRINTS. THANKS. THAT'S A POSITIVE ID ON A GOOD SUSPECT. Man: THERE WAS A FINGERPRINT LIFTED FROM A SODA CAN THAT WAS ON THE COFFEE TABLE IN THE LIVING ROOM AT THE SCENE OF THIS CRIME. CAME BACK TO A YOUNG FELLOW BY THE NAME OF SEAN BROWN. THIS GUY LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE. LIKE I SAID... Narrator: THE LAB WORK ALSO POINTS TO A MOTIVE. THE KILLER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 15-YEAR-OLD NIKKI. THE GUY WHO DID THIS IS GOING DOWN. Narrator: THEIR NEW SUSPECT, SEAN BROWN, IS SOMEONE PHILADELPHIA POLICE KNOW ALL TOO WELL. Man: SEAN IS COMMITTING SOME BURGLARIES IN THE AREA, AND HE WAS CAUGHT. Man: AND HE WAS ALLEGEDLY ON HOUSE ARREST SERVING TIME FOR THE SAID BURGLARY. Narrator: POLICY IMMEDIATELY WANT TO BRING IN SEAN BROWN FOR QUESTIONING, BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM. Man: SEAN BROWN WAS PUT ON PROBATION, AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN HOME WITH AN ANKLE MONITOR. HE VIOLATED IT BY CUTTING THE BRACELET OFF AND TAKING OFF. Narrator: SEAN BROWN IS ON THE RUN. DETECTIVES TURN TO ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO MAY KNOW WHERE HE IS, HIS FATHER. ** PHILADELPHIA POLICE. PHILADELPHIA POLICE. YOU'RE HERE FOR SEAN. YOU SEAN'S FATHER? YEAH, I AM. Man: WHEN I WENT TO SEE SEAN BROWN'S FATHER AT HIS RESIDENCE, HE WAS VERY COOPERATIVE. HE WANTED TO HELP. HE WANTED US TO LOCATE HIS SON. WE NEED TO CLEAR SOMETHING UP. WHAT IS IT THIS TIME? RIGHT NOW, WE JUST WANT TO TALK TO HIM. IT MUST BE BAD IF YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT IT IS. IT AIN'T TOO GOOD. THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY. HE HAD TOLD US THAT HE RECENTLY HAD TO KICK HIS SON OUT OF THE HOUSE. IT JUST CAME TO A POINT THAT HE WAS GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION, AND HE JUST WASN'T GOING TO TOLERATE THE BEHAVIOR. I TRIED WITH HIM. I DID. I GOT HIM THE HELP WHEN HE NEEDED IT. I LOOK AT HIM IN THE EYE NOW, AND I SEE SOMEONE I DON'T RECOGNIZE. DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND SEAN, MR. BROWN? YEAH, HE GOT A FRIEND OVER BY HIS MOM'S HOUSE. I BET HE'S THERE. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. MM-HMM. LET'S GO. AND THIS FRIEND IS AS BAD AS SEAN IS. I'D BE CAREFUL. ** Narrator: DETECTIVE BURKE AND THE FUGITIVE SQUAD DESCEND UPON SEAN BROWN'S FRIEND'S HOME WHERE THEY BELIEVE SEAN IS HIDING OUT. ** PHILADELPHIA POLICE, COME TO THE DOOR. PHILADELPHIA POLICE! PHILADELPHIA POLICE, COME TO THE DOOR! WHAT DO YOU WANT? I HAVE A SEARCH WARRANT, SO I WANT YOU TO COME TO THE DOOR NOW. IF YOU DON'T COME TO THE DOOR, I'M TAKING IT DOWN. GET READY. THIS IS A WARRANT TO SEARCH THE PREMISES. WE'RE LOOKING FOR SEAN BROWN. I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. JUST SIT DOWN, AND STAY OUT OF THE WAY. PHILADELPHIA POLICE! PHILADELPHIA POLICE. PHILADELPHIA POLICE. ** Man: WHEN WE WENT OUT ON THIS, WE HAD A FINGERPRINT. WE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHETHER HE WAS AN INVITED GUEST OR IF HE WAS OUR KILLER. IT WASN'T UNTIL WE GOT TO THAT HOUSE THAT WE JUMPED INTO FUGITIVE MODE. BASEMENT. ** WE WANTED TO LOCATE HIM AS QUICK AS WE COULD. ** ** WE SEARCHED THE WHOLE HOUSE, AND THE LAST PLACE TO SEARCH WAS THE GARAGE. GET THE DOOR. EVERY TIME YOU GO OUT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO ENCOUNTER, AND YOU ALWAYS GET NERVOUS. ** ** Narrator: PHILADELPHIA POLICE INVESTIGATORS THINK THEY'VE FINALLY TRACKED DOWN SEAN BROWN, NOW THEIR STRONGEST SUSPECT IN THE MURDER OF PATRICIA HENRY, HER BOYFRIEND, JAMES COFER, AND HER DAUGHTER, NIKKI. ** SEAN BROWN, IF YOU'RE IN HERE, COME OUT. ** SEAN BROWN, IF YOU'RE IN HERE, COME OUT. PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD. ** DON'T MOVE, SEAN. DON'T MOVE! ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT ME. YOU GOT ME. Man: HE WAS SURPRISED, AND HE LOOKED UP AT US, AND HE WAS OBVIOUSLY HIDING FROM US. SEAN BROWN, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN THE COURT OF LAW. LET'S GO. HE WAS TAKEN IN CUSTODY ON HIS PROBATION VIOLATIONS, HIS OUTSTANDING WARRANTS, AND HE WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE HOMICIDE UNIT FOR FURTHER QUESTIONING. Man: BUT YOU GOT TO REMEMBER AT THAT POINT, WE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER SEAN BROWN WAS AN INVITED GUEST. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HIS CONNECTION WAS TO THE HOUSE OR THE MURDER VICTIMS. YOU ALL RIGHT, SEAN? NEED SOMETHING TO EAT, DRINK? NO, I'M GOOD. SO I GOT SOME HOUSEKEEPING-TYPE STUFF I GOT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY. GO AHEAD. WHEN I FIRST PUT SEAN INTO AN INTERVIEW ROOM, I ASKED HIM COULD I SIT WITH HIM AND GET SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON HIM. SO YOU'RE, WHAT, 19? YEAH. YOU'RE ON HOUSE ARREST OVER ON YORK STREET? YEAH. A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU BUILD A RAPPORT WITH SOMEONE. JUST ASKING SIMPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR LIFE AND THEIR RELATIVES AND WHERE THEY LIVE AND WHERE THEY WENT TO SCHOOL, AND YOU BUILD A RAPPORT. YOU WORKING, SEAN? NO, NOT FOR A MINUTE. AND YOUR DAD, HOW IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM? IN THE 20-SO MINUTES IT TOOK TO GET THROUGH THAT REPORT, SEAN, AT SOME POINT, SAID, "I KNOW THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME CUTTING OFF MY ANKLE BRACELET." AND I SAID, "YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S NOT." WHAT'S ALL THIS FOR? YOU ALL KNOW I GOT A SHEET, RIGHT? ALL THAT'S ON THERE SOMEWHERE, SO WHAT'S ALL THIS FOR? I BET YOU ALREADY KNOW. IN FACT, I KNOW YOU ALREADY KNOW. IT'S ABOUT THOSE THREE PEOPLE YOU KILLED IN CRESCENTVILLE. WHAT YOU MEAN? WHAT I MEAN IS, SEAN, IS YOUR FINGERPRINTS WERE FOUND ON A SODA CAN IN THE HOUSE WHERE THE THREE PEOPLE YOU MURDERED LIVED, NIKKI, PATRICIA AND JAMES. YOU KNOW, THE THREE PEOPLE YOU SHOT AND KILLED? SO IF YOU GOT MY FINGERPRINTS, THEN YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT, BUT YEAH. I DID ALL THREE OF THEM. HE HAD A COCKINESS ABOUT HIM. IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE HE WAS ALMOST PROUD OF WHAT HE DID HERE. ALL RIGHT. SO YOU WANT TO TELL US HOW IT HAPPENED? WHY NOT? I CAUGHT HER COMING HOME. SHE DIDN'T EVEN SEE ME, BUT I SAW HER. MAN, THAT GIRL WAS FINE. I WANTED TO GET WITH HER. HEY! DON'T SCREAM. I AIN'T GOING TO HURT YOU. OKAY, PLEASE DON'T HURT ME. GET INSIDE. SHUT UP. SHUT UP. SHUT UP. HE JUST WALKED UP ON THE GIRL WHO WAS BASICALLY GETTING OFF A BUS GOING INTO HER HOUSE SHE HAD JUST PURCHASED A PIZZA. IF YOU SCREAM, I'LL KILL YOU. WHO ELSE IS IN HERE? NO ONE, I SWEAR. WHO? NO ONE, I SWEAR. SHE THOUGHT SEAN BROWN WANTED SOME MONEY AND MAYBE SOME ITEMS IN THE HOUSE. WHO'S IN HERE? I'LL GIVE YOU ALL THE MONEY I GOT. I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY. I WANT YOU. ** ** SEAN, DID YOU RAPE NIKKI? YOU DON'T KNOW? I ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU TELL ME. MAN, WE DID IT. THAT'S WHY I WAS THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. I HAD TO. THAT GIRL WAS FINE. Man: AND HE PRETTY MUCH REENACTED CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE CRIME SCENE, WHICH WERE PRETTY GRAPHIC AND WITH NO REMORSE. WIPE THAT SMIRK OFF YOUR FACE. YOU THINK YOU'RE A BIG MAN? YOU THINK WE'RE PLAYING HERE, SEAN? AFTER THAT, YOU TOOK HER TO THE BEDROOM? MM-HMM. SEE, I WAS GOING TO GO TO HER ROOM FOR A LITTLE BIT, LIE DOWN WITH HER. WHERE'S YOUR ROOM AT? IT'S THERE. WALK. PLEASE, NO! Man: THAT'S WHEN HE DISCOVERED JAMES COFER, AND HE BECAME UPSET AT NIKKI. WHO THE HELL IS THAT IN THERE? YOU TOLD ME NOBODY WAS HOME. NO! [ GUNSHOT ] HE WENT OVER AND FIRED HIS HANDGUN AT JAMES COFER WHILE HE WAS SLEEPING. Woman: AND THAT SO UPSET NIKKI, OF COURSE, THAT SHE SCREAMED, AND SO HE TURNED THE GUN ON NIKKI AND SHOT HER IN THE HEAD. ** AFTER THAT, EAT SOME PIZZA, HAD A SODA, TOO... AND I WENT AND WATCHED SOME FOOTBALL ON TV. MAN, OR AS I USED TO LIKE TO SAY, "HERE WE ARE IN THE LAND OF MURDER, MAYHEM AND MAN'S BASIC INHUMANITY TO MAN." NO! OH, THIS LITTLE ****. AFTER HE KILLS THESE PEOPLE, HE DECIDES HE WANTS TO WATCH MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, SO HE DOES WHAT ANY RED-BLOODED AMERICAN TEENAGER WILL DO, PROCEEDS TO WATCH THE DALLAS GAME. Man: HE WAS THEN WATCHING SOME TV. AT SOME POINT IN THE EVENING, PATRICIA HENRY CAME HOME. ** THEN I HEARD A NOISE COMING FROM THE BASEMENT. Man: PATRICIA HENRY WAS COMING IN THROUGH THE BASEMENT DOOR. IT WAS THE MOM COMING HOME, AND I DID HER, TOO. HAD TO, I CAN'T LEAVE A WITNESS. Man: AND HE CONFRONTED HER AND SHOT AND KILLED HER. Narrator: HE THEN ROLLED PAT HENRY UP IN A RUG, ATTEMPTING TO HIDE HER BODY BEHIND A PILE OF CLOTHES. SEAN HARDLY LOOKED 19. HE LOOKED LIKE ANY YOUNG KID THAT YOU WOULD SEE ON THE STREET, COMING AND GOING FROM SCHOOL, BUT YOU PUT A GUN IN THAT KID'S HAND, AND THEY'RE CAPABLE OF KILLING SOMEONE. THIS WAS A STRANGER THAT WALKED UP ON A 15-YEAR-OLD AND FOUND HIS WAY INTO THE HOUSE WITH A GUN AND COMMITTED ALL THESE HOMICIDES. SO I GOT TO ASK SEAN, WHY DID YOU DO IT? MAN, PEOPLE DIE EVERY DAY. Man: HE WAS A THIEF AND A PUNK, AND HE WANTED TO GRADUATE TO BEING A MURDERER, AND ON THAT DAY, HE DID, AND HE KILLED THREE INNOCENT PEOPLE. Woman: HOW COULD SOMEONE JUST RANDOMLY COME OFF OF THE STREET AND DO SUCH AN ACT? Man: TO DO WHAT HE DID, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE ACTS HE COMMITTED IN THAT HOUSE, AND THEN TO SIT DOWN AND EAT A PIZZA AND WATCH MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL WAS PURE EVIL. Man: NINETEEN-YEAR-OLD SEAN BROWN IS CHARGED WITH THE KILLING OF PAT, NIKKI AND JAMES. PHILADELPHIA POLICE NEVER CONNECTED BROWN WITH ANY OTHER MURDERS. Woman: THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW SEAN ERIC BROWN WAS AT THE SENTENCING, AND I WAS JUST STUNNED TO SEE THIS YOUNG BOY THAT HAD COMMITTED SUCH A DEVIOUS ACT. Narrator: THE JUDGE SENTENCES BROWN TO THREE CONSECUTIVE LIFE TERMS. Woman: IT WASN'T GOING TO BRING MY FAMILY MEMBERS BACK, BUT IT DID HELP IN KNOWING THAT THE PERSON THAT ACTUALLY PULLED THE TRIGGER AND THAT DID ALL OF THIS WAS BEHIND THE BARS, AND THERE WAS NO QUESTIONING AS TO WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS GUILTY. HE WAS THE ONE THAT HAD DID THIS, AND HE WAS THE ONE NOW PAYING THE PRICE FOR IT.
