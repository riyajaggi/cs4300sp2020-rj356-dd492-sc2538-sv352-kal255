And--and I have Ash. - Yeah, I told him to keep an eye on you, little one. But hands off. - [laughs] My God. Okay, parental unit. [indistinct chatter] [telephone ringing] - Hi. I was wondering if I could get some information on a former student. - Dunbar Rakes? Again? - Shirley told you. - And Luann. We can't give any personal information out. You know that. [telephone rings] [dramatic music] ♪ You must be Zoe. Welcome to Hilland. - Thank you. [school bell rings] [indistinct chatter] - Hey. - Hey. I didn't think you were talking to me. - I'm not. - Hey, El. El, wait. I need to tell you something. I got a video last night... from @m0nk3ym4nnn. - That's not possible. - @m0nk3ym4nnn's dead, Rowan. - I know. [school bell rings] I was there, remember? - Can I see the video? - It was a flash. It's gone. - You didn't screen-grab it? - No, I-I wasn't thinking fast enough. I messaged him back. - You what? - What did he say? - He said he wants revenge. - You shouldn't have done that. You should have ignored it. - Hey, hey. You told me I can't ignore a bully. Do you remember that? - Yesterday you said you didn't get any messages. Is it because I just got out? - Maybe. - Are you gonna tell your dad? - No. No way. He's basically had me on house arrest since Nicki's party. - Okay, well, what about Brie? She can help. - Brie got busted for hacking government files. She got six months, Hailey. - Sorry. - What if Dunbar wasn't @m0nk3ym4nnn? - No. We know he was. - Then how is he messaging me from the grave? - Look, I have auditions, and my mom is making me see a tutor because I'm failing. I've got enough going on. So just, please, leave me out of it. - Hey, will you--will you come over this weekend? Jake leaves tomorrow, and Ash is working late, and I-- [sighs] I'd rather not sleep there alone. - Yeah, uh... Jake's leaving? For, like, the weekend or-- - No, he's, um-- he's joining the police academy upstate, so... He's gonna be gone for a while. - Oh. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. [girls chattering indistinctly] - Rowan, right? Got any tips for the new kid? - What? - You know, teachers to avoid, places to hang out, cute boys to date. - Um... where are you from? - Uh, I'm from here. I went to Montgomery up until last week. - Oh, um... what happened? - [chuckles] They said I wasn't a good fit. [scoffs] - Do you know anyone here? - You know, not really. My cousin used to go here. It's really different. - Well, Montgomery's definitely in the nicer part of town. - [chuckles] I bet there's an upside to slumming it. I heard poor people party hard. Speaking of, know any dealers? - Excuse me? - I need some weed. - Uh, yeah, actually, there's, um-- there's this guy, Ash. Do you know The Brew? - Uh, yeah, sure. - Yeah, he works there. - Well, thanks. So, uh... what did you steal from the school secretary's filing cabinet? - You saw that? - Yeah. I want to know everything. [school bell rings] - Okay, class, I'm going to assign partners for the interview project I mentioned last Friday. You guys can pick any topic under the sun. - Can I pick you as a topic, Ms. Dawson? [laughter] - Really? That's as good as you can do? Like I was saying, you guys can pick any topic. Obviously, try to keep on the subject of the things we've been discussing. I want you guys to write long-form, open-ended questions. Okay. So Tara Killington and Sage Elway. Um, let's do Derek Stockard and Jess Bowers, Rowan Fricks and Brandon Darrow, uh, the Chelseas, Donison and Chanders, uh, Zoe Desaul and Hannah MacPherson. [school bell rings] - Hey! When should we work on the project? - Rowan... can't you just do it yourself? Hey, I know how you teacher's pets are. Even if I did some work, you wouldn't be happy with it. - You're right, because even if you used your mouth for anything other than the ingestion of narcotics, nothing clever would come out of it anyways. - Ingestion of narcotics. I used my mouth in a lot of different ways. I can show you right now-- - No, thank you very much. Um, I'll do it myself. - Thank you.
