What does that even mean? - It's Shakespeare. HAILEY: "Romeo and Juliet" was our spring play freshman year.

 [all exclaim] HAILEY: I said that it was a joke. A video I made when my mom was sleeping. - How many times have you done it? Hailey? [doorbell rings] [tense music] - Hello? Hello? - Dad? ♪ What is that? [door slams] - Yeah, it's a jump drive, but the video file is corrupt. Yeah, I can bring it by to you tonight. I don't know if it has anything to do with the other video. You never know. ♪ No, no return address. It was just dropped off on the porch. No. That's a good idea. Sounds good. ♪ - [whispering] Rowan. Come here. - What the hell are you doing here? - What's wrong? - What are you doing with my sister? I saw you two together. - It's-- it's not like that. We went to high school together, okay? And she-- she saw a video of us on--on that website, and she told me everything. She said there must be a good reason you can't go to your dad, and, look, I want to help. Why didn't you tell me what was going on? ♪ - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I lied about my age. ♪ I knew you wouldn't... if you knew. - I hate that this is wrong. ♪ Come here. ♪ [classical music] - Mom? [distant crash] Mom. I... [eerie music] ♪ Mom! [crying] Mom. Mom, please. Please. ♪ [crying] [phone chimes] ♪ [distant thud] ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ WOMAN: I tagged you guys. - We can't. We can't. ♪ - Jake? ROWAN: Dad! JAKE: Rowan. - No, get away from me. - What? I found it. I--I was gonna ask you what-- - Dad! Dad! ♪ - Put your hands where I can see 'em. ♪ On your knees! - Dad, what are you doing? - How do you know this guy? - I've never seen him before. ♪ - Get in the house, Rowan. Get in the house! Got any weapons? JAKE: No. - Get down. Get down. ♪ SEAN: Hailey? - Sean--Sean. - What happened? - She won't wake up. She won't--she won't wake up. - Shh, it's okay. - [crying] She won't wake up. Shh.

[sirens wailing in distance] [dog barking] [sirens wailing] [car engine starts outside] - What happens now? - They take him downtown, and they question him. - Why? - Because the suspect in that girl's murder was wearing the exact same mask. Are you telling me that that guy was just on the side of the house for no reason? You don't know him? - That's what I said, isn't it? I'm exhausted. [phone chimes] - Who's that? - Doesn't matter. [sirens wailing in distance] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ ROWAN: How's your mom? HAILEY: She's sleeping now. They had to pump her stomach. I bet she thinks I did it this time. I'm scared, Ro. He could have really hurt her. Killed her, even. And I did it to her so many times before. - Why? - No one else has to turn their phone in at 9:00 every night. When she would take my computer away, I just... I feel so disconnected. You know, like I was missing out on something. And it would just make me so stressed. Like, just absolutely crazy with anxiety. - At least she cares. I totally messed up with Jake. I... I don't know what to do. I was worried he would get in more trouble if I said that I knew him. We have to get him out. - How? - Figure out who Monkeyman is. - Well, he left you a big-ass clue last night. Why roses? - I don't know. Roses and violets. Red and blue. Another school's colors? Are you still gonna be able to go out tonight? I really think we should all be together. - My aunt's staying here with my mom. She'll never have a clue. - Have you heard from Elisia? - Nothing. She's pissed about you and Jake. - I kept telling everyone to be honest. And I'm the biggest liar of all. - Only 12 hours left. I was thinking. A bunch of guys auditioned for Romeo last fall. What if Monkeyman auditioned and didn't get the part? - Can you think of anyone who was pissed? - I mean, you always piss someone off with auditions. I'm sure there were a few guys that were upset. - Who? - You know how bad I am with names. - Do you have a list of the guys who tried out? - It was a long time ago. [phone ringing] What's that? - Find that list of Romeos. ♪ Someone wanted the police to have this. They left it on our front porch. Dad said something about the file being corrupt. - Think it's Monkeyman? ROWAN: I don't think so. Why would he send something to the cops? Dad thought it might be connected. - Yeah, I'll take a look at it. - Okay. - Anything interesting I'll just shoot to your phone. So you know the countdown's at ten hours? Where are you gonna be? - Just at home. Dad'll be there. [phone rings] BRIE: So I found out some more stuff about Elisia's parents in the police report. The reason they think it's arson? They found traces of kerosene at the house. I know she told you it was candles, but someone started that fire. - Well, Hailey trusts her. Brie. About the pills. I was just really worried, you know? I believed Hailey when she said they were yours, but I shouldn't have gone to Dad. I--I should have trusted you enough to ask. - I know Mom screwed you up, but not everyone's gonna leave you. You can trust me. All right? Hailey too. We're in this together. It's all right. [phone chimes] - It's Ash. WOMAN: ♪ If tonight we should die ♪ - He knows something.

Check it. I guess, like, a week ago, Raven was messing with someone right here at The Grotto, being an asshole to them. - So she was mean to someone, and then she just winds up dead? Who was it? - Someone told me that dude Brandon was here when it happened. You know him? - I do. - Okay, well, we have six hours, so call him. - He doesn't really like me right now, thanks to you. ♪ [line trilling] ♪ Yeah, no answer. - Do we have to go to that party tonight? I just... - I'm not gonna stay at home alone. After what happened last night? How can you even say that? ROWAN: Okay, okay. You go, I go. HAILEY: Okay. - But we have to find Elisia.

I haven't been easy. - You're gonna be okay. [engine starts] ROWAN: I found it. - Found what? - A note from freshman year... from a secret admirer. "Roses are red, violets are blue.
