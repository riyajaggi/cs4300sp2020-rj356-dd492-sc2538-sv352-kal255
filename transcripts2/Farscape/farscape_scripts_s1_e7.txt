 Farscape (1999â€“2003): Season 1, Episode 7 - I, E.T. - full transcript 
 The removal of Moya's control collar activates a homing signal. Pilot manages to mask it by landing Moya in a swamp, unsure if a Leviathan can land on a planet or take off again. They homing signal must be removed, but they need to find something to dull the pain it will cause Moya when the device is removed.

 Would you look at the size of that thing? Every sweep confirms that is a dead ship. And you're sure it isn't Crais'. Positive. What is another Peacekeeper ship doing in the uncharted territories? Don't know. Something's wrong. Yeah, no kidding. Like, shouldn't we be doing warp 1,000 by now? Think how big the winner of this battle must be. I'm with John. I say we leave this tomb immediately. And I say that there is information on her data spools that could lead us home.

 There may be weapons on board we can use. And I need to know who she is. What? Who cares what her name is? It's the Zelbinion. So, what is it with the Zelbinion? It is the most feared ship in the Peacekeeper armada. Yeah, well, clearly somebody didn't get that message. She's been missing in battle for over 100 cycles. Aeryn, confirming there is breathable air beyond the connection hatch. Pilot cautions you remain starboard and high. Most of the vacuum damage was sustained in attack from below. Is this a good idea? You can stay behind if you wish, but I have questions. Ready?

 I can't believe you lived on a ship like this, your whole life. When you told me endless tales of your home, you spoke of forests and rivers and valleys. Well, I was thinking of walls, not unlike these. Well, I'm sure it looks better with carpeting. This ship is legendary, even in my culture. It was thought invincible. Yeah, well, just ask Leonardo Di Caprio. Even the big ones go down. Whoa! Deep space desiccation. I expected you to go looting, Rygel. Looting? I am Dominar of over six hundred billion subjects. I shouldn't stoop so low. If I recall, you stooped for the last three derelict ships we came upon, or was it four? Is something bothering you? When I was ripped from my throne over a hundred and thirty cycles ago, this was the first vessel I was tortured on. It's no better in here. Such a large ship and nothing to salvage. How disappointing that all the scavengers have robbed us of our glory. This navigation console has been completely destroyed. There are no galactic star charts here. This excursion is over. Wait. What about this console? The lights are still on. Someone has regenerated communications. Recently? Or do you guys have like, the best car batteries of all time? Aeryn! I'm blocked. - Mine! - No! No! Officer Sun. The escaped prisoners. How does she know us? Aeryn? Because she is from Crais' ship. My name is John Crichton, an astronaut... A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole... Now I'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship- a living ship Full of strange alien life-forms... Help me, help me. Listen, please. Is there anybody out there who can hear me? ...being hunted by an insane military commander... ...doing everything I can... I'm just looking for a way home. You will remain in review stance until I dismiss, understood? Name. Division. Assignment. Gilina Renaez. Speak up. Tranco Support. Maintenance Provost. Chin up, eyes locked. Why don't you give it a rest, Miss Drill Sergeant? Can't you see she's going to pass out? I'm not like her. Not remotely. She is a tech. Not a soldier, right? No weapons, so why not lighten up? More flies with honey. That kind of thing. You clearly do not understand. She is from Crais' ship; that means he is nearby. She knows exactly who we are and would consider it her duty to lie to us. Point taken. But if she drops, you're not going to get your answers. This is my world, John. Don't interfere. Still alive? How is that possible? She can't be from the original crew. I don't have those answers. I suggest you go over and ask them yourself. To that ship? Never. Never again. Ohh! How long have we known each other, Rygel? Long enough for me to see your blue backside meditating, but not long enough for you to touch me. Confront your demons, Rygel. Or they will chase you from the shadows to the pyre. Captain Crais didn't want to delay his search for you. So after coming upon the Zelbinion, he ordered my unit over for a full tech survey. What happened to the rest of your unit? Two solar days after arriving, another ship came out of nowhere. I'd never seen such a weapon before. I barely had time to escape before they incinerated our marauder transport. It's the Sheyang. There's evidence of their work all over the ship. Could they have done all this? Hardly. The Sheyang are nothing more than opportunistic foragers. Can you tell me what happened here? How the Zelbinion died? Long before we arrived, other scavengers pried loose the data spools. There is no record. Officer Sun, I think you should know, I consider you a traitor, therefore worthy of the punishment it merits. But as a Sebacean, I believe you are as deserving as I to know the truth about a cultural treasure. I am not lying when I say I do not know. I will investigate the radiant chamber. I'll meet you at the next junction. We'll wait for you, D'argo. I can't believe you're not Sebacean. Human. It's kind of like Sebacean, but we haven't conquered other worlds yet, so we just kick the crap out of each other. Thank you for stopping her from killing me today. Oh, yeah, well, I try to save a life a day. Usually it's my own. Oh, man. If you guys only used your know-how to... To what? To fulfill your vision of who we should be? To do good. We are Peacekeepers. Other cultures hire us to keep order, to keep harmony. As well as assassinations, torture, kidnap. Knock it off, weasel. I've barely got used to sharing my accommodation with one of these abominations. Dispel the thought of two! Hello, Rygel. Welcome home. Everything I see confirms her story. There aren't even any wire collars left in the weapons control room. This vessel has been gutted to worthlessness. Oh, no! He's from my unit. I knew him. - Sheyang victim. - Burnt to death. Officer Kranda. Kranda? What was he doing guarding the likes of you? This is grots' work. Your whole unit was demoted after your defection. They can only be reinstated upon your death. Come on. Let's get outta here. Excuse me, Zhaan. Could you check scan vector gappa and tell me what you see? I'm... I'm not sure. I think it's a ship trying just to stay out of sensor range. A... Sheyang ship? Why are the Sheyangs back?! What didn't you tell us?! If this one doesn't cooperate, kill her. Is that why you're still alive? 'cause you cooperated with the enemy?! I am not the traitor. You are. Tell me! Stop it! That is enough! She knew they were coming back. She knew. That's enough. She's not a traitor. Not by a long shot. Crais never gave her a chance. Not like the chance we're giving you. I hid, while the Sheyangs filled their ship to capacity. They said they were going to come back for the D.S. Is that "Defense Shield"? It's not operational. But it's the least damaged part of the ship. Let's go. Move. Go. Situation. Their plasma conductor is targeted on us. Let's signal our intent to leave and then depart without incident. Impossible with the Sheyang. If they sense strength, they flee. Weakness, then they attack without mercy. Then we get the others aboard, we decouple and then attempt to Starburst. They have the ability to destroy us before we even get ten metras. But we have no offensive capabilities, nothing to signal strength. I know. No, this panel is useless. But if we could breach the connections from this side to the other, we could make the defense screen operational. Do it. Officer Sun, I know you're not a tech, but... Just tell me. It all depends on the power reserves. I- it's going to take eight arns, minimum. Eight arns? No, no, no, I know what she's talking about. It's a progressive power draw, so the fibre pattern has to be maintained in sequence. That takes time. Right? Yeah. Eight arns. The Sheyang could fire at any moment. This new ship makes no move to defend itself. When was the last time you saw a Leviathan in the territories, Teurac? Even you, at your age have never claimed such a prize. Yes. it is a fortunate time. Ripe. Defenseless. Mine. Evran! Prepare to attack! The Sheyang have initiated their weapons countdown. They're going to need some help. It's too late. If Moya becomes severely damaged, we may need to retreat to the Zelbinion. D'argo? Zhaan? Moya and I are very afraid of fire. What I wouldn't give for just one Kkore Cannon. One Wetox missile. I spit on your grave, you sons of cowards! I rip out your throats! Pilot... transmit his image to the Sheyang vessel. But what would... Do it! Transmitting. A Luxan?! We're fighting a Luxan! Terminate plasma! Terminate plasma attack! Cut transmission. I don't believe it. They're powering down their weapons. Congratulations, D'argo. You've just bought us some time. Right. No lies. Does this ship have any weapons aboard that are still active? Anything we can use to fight back? No. Everything has been dismantled or destroyed. What about this thing? The defense screen? What will this do? What do you think? No, the question is will it stop a Sheyang attack? Well, be that as it may, we can't stall them for eight arns. Four. Four... I'll, um, uh... I'll do half the work. What? Is there some kind of union thing I don't know about? No. It's just this wiring is very sophisticated. Yep. And I love opera. Beautiful! It's not my face they are afraid of, D'argo. You must continue the ruse. I cannot lie to an opponent in battle. It's not lying. Simply mislead them. For a priest you certainly have a very flexible morality. Well, I apologize. It must be done, and you must do it. I will assist you if we live. Is something the matter? This isn't going to work. The main fusion panel is charred. Gilina, you told Aeryn that you could do this. I didn't want to be executed for failing to try. Look, I told you, we are not killers. You killed Captain Crais' brother. That was an accident. Our ships collided. It could have easily gone the other way. Can I get you both some rations? Some chilled frotein, perhaps. We're out of five-line conduit, Officer Sun. Those are the wrong kind. I've searched throughout the ship. Have you tried medical rejuvenation on the seventh tier... I know where it is. That door's jammed. We possess the salvage rights to that vessel you are docked with. And yet you will not produce the authority manifest to confirm that. Must we distrust each other? Once my soldiers are back on board, you may continue your "salvage." End this charade, Teurac. He has no soldiers. He doesn't even have a crew. My young protege does not think you can back up your claims. He thinks we can invade and destroy you. Curious. I was just thinking the same thing about you. Your quaint cockpit seems to belie any military boasts. Your crummy cockpit seems to belie any military boasts. Pray that you should never know. And Ka D'argo, make no mistake, you are trying my patience. Well done. Barely. You must stop with this incessant prompting. You asked for my help, D'argo. You foisted it upon me. But now that moment is passed. How much time do we have, Pilot? If we are to believe the Peacekeeper tech, two more arns. Three conversations without substance I believe is enough. The next one will spurn attack. And it's always red wire or blue wire. Red wire or blue wire. And at the last possible second, he cuts the wrong wire. And the bomb never goes off. No, he cuts the wrong wire. That's not the point. 15 seconds later, they're running out of the building and everything blows all to hell. And you call this entertainment? Yeah, well, you know, it replaced cockfighting. Oh! Oh, my eye. Oh, let me see. Let me see. Whoa, careful, careful. Let me see. Get it out... Hold still... shh, shh, shh. - Oh! - Ow! Oh, sorry. Um... Let me see. It's okay. Yeah? Yeah? You know what else happens in these movies is that... the guy and the girl always end up surviving... and liking each other. We have such fiction also. It's a small universe. Come now. We've just begun. Oh, there you are. We've been looking all over for you, Rygel. You're making the DRDs nervous. And we need your negotiating talents. I think I was meant to die here the first time. That's why the spirits have brought me back to the Zelbinion. I don't think so. For one thing, the captain of that ship is dead. Not to me. Then you must confront him. How? Find his corpse. It will set you free. I have never known a full Luxan warrior to be on a ship without defense and offense. My intention is not to lead us into a hidden threat. What is your intention? Evran! Ignite the plasma generators. Aim for the Leviathan. Destroy her. What do you mean, they're firing? What did you say to them? Nothing! They will not respond to my signal. How close are we? Close. Disconnect all the black wires. The black ones. Here. How much time, Pilot? Less than 50 microts. Officer Sun... Yes. Pass me up those connections. Yes. Come on, come on, come on... 35... That's it. 30... Full charge, Evran. No mistakes. 20... - Click, click. - Okay. Okay. Come on baby, baby, baby. Got it? Yes. Ten... One more, okay? Five... Hurry! Got it! The defense screens held. Moya's unharmed. Evran! Our weapon had no effect. Recharge immediately! Hit them again! Answer to me, Lomus. I am greatly disappointed in you. Somehow, I expected the... Dominar of Hyneria to be more... dominating. I regret to dampen spirits, D'argo, but Pilot reports a problem. My scans show the defense screen is not fully complete. There are gaps which leave us vulnerable. The D.S. is two identical systems overlaid on top of one another. We only had time to hook up one. W- w-wait a minute. How crazy is this? Now, there's two systems, right? Yeah. So why don't be install one of them on Moya? I have been sworn never to compromise Peacekeeper technology with the enemy. I will do it for you. For all of you. To displace an Overlord during battle and then fail? It's not my fault. What about my father? Your oath? Oh, frax your father! This is on you. Choose. I will lead my unit and capture that ship with no prisoners taken. Those gaps in the protective barrier you must fly through are small and shifting. Do you leave me a choice? Perhaps one day they will sing songs of your early death. So, you like deep space physics, too? Yeah. Do you know cosmic theory? Yeah. it's something that intrigues me. I got my doctorate in it. Uh, doctorate? What is that? It's a couple of letters they add to the end of your name. Not much help out here, though. Last textbook I read made a case for why you and all other forms of alien life didn't exist. Can you, um... can you anchor this while I pull? Yeah. Hold that. Got it? Yeah, go. It seems human and Sebacean men are... much the same. Yeah. I've not noticed any differences in the women, either. I've set up four of the components... in the Maintenance Bay. Sorry for interrupting! Hang on. Aeryn? Aeryn? Aeryn, would you wait? Look, what the heck's the matter with you? I'm sure you could see how heavy these things are. There's at least another ten in there. Do not come down this corridor without one. Would you stop? Hey! Look, hey, what happened back there was... None of my business. Yes, it was. You and I are shipmates. What I'm trying to say is... haven't you just clicked with a guy? What? Clicked? Yeah, you know? Found a guy attractive. Yes, but I didn't let it... In the beginning, I found you... interesting. Me. Yes, but only for a moment. Good. That's, uh... Good. I-I mean, it's good to be on... even terms. I agree. Yeah, um... it's always a good idea to clear the air. Very clear air! Durka. Is it really you, Durka? You killed yourself, Durka. You coward. You once told me I would never leave your ship alive. You robbed me of so many cycles. But no matter what you did to me, I'll always remember one thing. You lose! I have full separation from the main module. Launch the others. How many are there? Uh, at least a dozen. They're moving too fast to track them all. Pilot, can they get aboard the Zelbinion? Can they breach the defense screen? When I kill the bypass, these two polaric discs will be attracted to each other, strongly, so you have to hold them apart. Because if they touch each other, this whole room will be vaporized. All right, scoundrel foragers. It's time to prove our glory. Have any of them made it through? I can't tell yet. I'll have to do a debris analysis. Quickly! Aim for the gaps in the defense screen. I'll do it myself! They're going to pull incredibly hard. Okay. Ready? Now. Whoa! Aeryn, where are you? Maintenance Bay. What's the problem? We think one of the Sheyangs got on board the Zelbinion. How the hell did that happen? Not important. What is, is he may be heading right toward you. You've got to stop. Not once I've started the process. Then finish the process. I'm working as fast as I can. I want you to get out of here. I won't leave you. On the ground, now! Do it! Gilina, I want you out of here. If you die here, John... I die, too. He keeps blocking my route, forcing me to take the long way around. You may have to defend yourselves. Look, Aeryn, it's a long story but I've kind of got my hands full here, so you're going to have to get here! You'd better get here fast, because Froggy's outside the door right now. Aeryn's going to get here. Come on, Aeryn. Come on. They spit fire? How come nobody tells me this stuff? How come nobody tells me they spit fire? Aeryn? Come on, Aeryn, come on. Shit. Howdy, big guy. Look, um, as you can see, it's not likely we're going to hurt you, so take anything you want, but if these two paddles touch... Listen, gas-whole! You kill us, you kill yourself. You had your chance to retreat. Come a little closer then. Let's just find out what happens when these paddles touch. Sorry about the mess. Absolutely not. Our situation is untenable as it is. I'm with D'argo on this, John. Allowing Gilina to encourage Crais' return is suicidal at best. Look, the Sheyangs are sitting out there waiting for another chance to slip through, and Crais is going to come back one day. What then? We have done well to evade Crais as it is. With a start, he would soon catch us. Not if she doesn't tell him we were here. I'm a trusting soul at best, but not to a fault. The tech will not reveal our presence. And how can you be so sure about that? You know what happened to me. Being deemed irreversibly contaminated by Crais. Contamination by enemy life-forms. That could happen to you. Punishment is death. Or worse, banishment. I hope you will only ever imagine how horrible it is to never return to the life that you love. You are smarter than that, Gilina. They have sent a distress call to the Peacekeeper Carrier that passed through here earlier. It is returning at maximum speed. Any word from Lomus? His life signal is no longer active. What do you think we should do, Evran? I'm sorry you are leaving. My officers are drawing up plans to retaliate. I doubt so. You had nothing, but you used it well. Evran, there is no shame in losing to a clever opponent. And Ka D'argo... I make it a point to someday kill my clever opponents. You were magnificent, D'argo. With or without your assistance? In spite of it. Crais will ask you many questions. I will lie. I wish I had been so smart. You free this weekend? I have to overhaul a Prowler engine, but apart from that... yes. Gilina, I don't want you to go. Are you asking me to stay? No, I can't. I can't. This is no way to live. And I can't ask you to come back with me, because Crais would kill you. So what do we do? You get any vacation time? I'm never going to see you again, am I? Oh, yes. We'll find a way. We'll organize a rendezvous point for later. Something, anything. Something. Crichton, there is no more time. We must go. In a minute, D'argo. Life sucks. It brought us together. Okay. It sucks a little less. Crichton? Crichton. Hey. A greeting I shall never understand. Well, it's kind of all-purpose. Let's the other person decide what they want to talk about. What if they don't want to talk? Then they say "hey" back. Hey. Well, now, the first person that doesn't want to talk can be trumped if the other person realizes that they need to. Hey. I hate being ambushed. Well, you got him in the end. That's all that counts. I wasn't talking about the Sheyangs. You know, on my world they say that loss is the hardest emotion to deal with. In my world, showing pain is a sign of weakness. How can you not feel pain after what you've been through? Don't presume to understand me, John. Oh, that's not fair. That's not fair, Aeryn. You bash me all the time for being soft. Well the fact of the matter is that sometimes it's an advantage and this is one of them. I think I understand you perfectly. There's no way you can know what I feel. If I somehow, someday get a chance to return to my world, walk around my old neighborhood, see my old house, Dad's truck, best friend's bike on the lawn, and then I get a chance to go inside. I walk through the living room, upstairs to my room. I had a poster of Clint Eastwood. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly'. And then I think, what if everyone were dead? What if all my friends and family were lying there... dead? Now, what would it be like to go home then? I stand corrected.
