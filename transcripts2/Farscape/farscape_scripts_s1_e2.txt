 Farscape (1999â€“2003): Season 1, Episode 2 - Exodus from Genesis - full transcript 
 Moya is invaded by some creatures. They increase the heat on Moya, and they're creating replicas of the crew. Peacekeeper cannot stand heat, Aeryn starts to suffer Heat Delirium. The crew must figure who is real and who is a replica, and shut down the heat. They must also contend with a Peacekeeper squad that's searching for Crichton.

 Where the Hezmana is that siren coming from? Sounds like from the inside of my head. What the Hezmana is it? It's definitely Peacekeeper. And don't do that at me. What? That... that... I can't help it. The sound frequency's doing something to my eye. Feels like it's melting my brain. It couldn't actually be doing something to my brain, could it?

 DRDs have located the siren's point of origin. Tier seven, rear storage compartment. We're there, Pilot. The DRDs are removing the cover now. Can't you stop that noise? Let me see. Pilot, good work. You've stopped it. I have only neutralized the internal sound. The device itself is still broadcasting some kind of signal into deep space using Moya's hull as a maximizer. It's using my skull as a maximizer. Why am I still twitching? It's a Paddac Beacon.

 It starts broadcasting unless it gets a regular signal from the Control Collar. Which we removed. And why didn't you tell us about this? Well, not all Leviathan transports have them. I had no way of knowing. Look, I'm new to all this escaped prisoner crap, all right? Oh, no... It won't let DRDs near it. The external broadcast is increasing exponentially. If there's a Peacekeeper patrol within a quarter light cycle they'll know exactly where we are. Aeryn, can the device be removed? I'll get it out. Pilot, can the device be removed? I'm running diagnostics now. Even if it can be removed, it will take time. Meanwhile, we're broadcasting our position like a two-headed Tronkan shrill singer. Look, if we can't remove it, can't we at least muffle it somehow lessen the signal strength? It is using all of Moya's hull. John, there is no way to insulate Moya's entire outer skin. Pilot, shut down power to this section. That is Moya's primary neural nexus. I cannot shut that down. Water. Wa... Pilot, this system we're passing through, the middle planet. It's got water, right? 30% surface moisture. Not so much water as... bog. Fine, fine. Bog. We'll use the bog as insulation. What, and take Moya down on to the planet's surface? She can do that, right? Right? Pilot? When Leviathans are young they often play with a planet's gravity. See how close they can come. There's a tale told about an adult male who once touched down on a planet's surface... though, no one knows if it's true or not. Well, if she can't, she can't. We can stick our heads between our legs and kiss our asses good-bye. It's a saying. Wait! Wait! I'm not ready! Oh! Somebody help tie me down. Pilot, how is Moya doing? Atmospheric friction within tolerable limits but she's starting to feel the gravity. Definitely feeling the increased weight. Just put it down in that swamp we targeted. It's probably not going to matter much. But you'd better get yourself in position for "landing." That looks like Earth. Brace yourselves. We're down. Moya has... landed. Am I the only one seeing this? We're sinking! My name is John Crichton, an astronaut... ...a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole... Now I'm lost in some distant part of the universe On a ship- a living ship Full of strange alien life-forms... Help me... Listen, please. Is there anybody out there who can hear me? I'm being hunted by an insane military commander... ...doing everything I can... I'm just looking for a way home. Pilot, does that mean we've...? ...stopped sinking? Yes. We're almost completely submerged. You okay? Okay? No, I'm not okay. We're in the mud... under the mud. You're Hynerian. You're aquatic. What's your problem? Aquatic- that's water, not mud. Mud is mud. You can't breathe in it. You can't move in it. It holds you. It grabs you. It sucks you down. You want to know about mud? I know about mud. Guy knows mud. And the beacon? Muffled. The mud's insulating the transmission. And how's Moya? Very scared. This beacon was hastily installed. So, we just cut it out of there and we can fly off this blasted planet. I told you, it won't let DRDs near it. Well, somebody's got to go in there. Oh, no. You covered me in mud because I have no say but in this, I have a say, and I say no. Get someone else to do your dirty work. He'll do it. With apologies but that is Moya's primary neural nexus. It is an intensely sensitive area. Well, how sensitive is sensitive? Look, she's just going to have to endure it. Could you be a little sensitive? Can we cut this thing out? The level of pain will be intolerable. She may die. Pilot, is there any kind of anesthetic. Something we could use to apply to ease Moya's pain? An anesthetic? For a Leviathan? There is without question no such... Pilot? Clorium. Clorium? Clorium? It's an element. It is one of the six forbidden cargoes. Leviathans cannot transport it because it numbs them. Is there any on board? Never. It's a very common element. It's found in many forms. It's an atmospherically induced isotope of twinium. Is there any out there? Yo, Aeryn, let's go. Hey, come on. This is your chance to flex those big, Peacekeeper commando muscles out in the field. "Peacekeeper commando." Yeah, really. Is there a problem? Oh, I find and explain our top-secret tracking device to a bunch of escaped prisoners and then lead a mission to destroy it. Number one, you're not leading the mission; Number two, those Peacekeepers you're so concerned about they'd kill you right now. It was the Peacekeepers... ...turned on me for speaking up for you. I don't know what I was thinking. Well, back home we call it being stand-up. Well, I stood up and I no longer have a home. Well, join the club. Hey, does this bother you? Because it bugs the crap out of me. So can we go, before we become a permanent tourist attraction in this bog? And my eye falls out? Jeez! It's kind of like Louisiana. Or Dagobah. Dagobah- where Yoda lives. Who's Yoda? Just a little green guy. Trains warriors. Oh. This particle analyzer is defective. It's Peacekeeper technology- you use it. Techs use them, not infantry. Pilot said you press this, this and... this. Well, it's just like a VCR... except easier. Whoa. Whoa. We got something. That's a weak reading. At that level we'll have to bring back half the planet. We need to find a concentrated source. What's that? What the hell is that? Vehicle! Take cover! Can we get some light here? I swear I saw it. Nile Yunn said he saw it, too- him and his wife. Big as two mallac fields. Came in low over the banja trees like they was no bigger than jaw picks. There's hascann and his sons and the bosk twins! Let's see what's what. We need to draw them away from the ship. We need clorium. Aeryn and I will distract them. You find the clorium and we'll all meet back at the ship. Hey, over here. Over there! There he is! I think I got him! Pilot, did you send for me? I have completed tracing the connection points between the Peacekeeper beacon and Moya's neural system. Yes? The interlacing is extremely intricate. Pilot, how did the Peacekeepers ever get such a device aboard without you or Moya knowing about it? Eh... hmm... When Peacekeepers capture a Leviathan they immediately administer a sleep agent- very potent. The weak, the old do not survive which, I suppose, is part of its purpose. While the Leviathan sleeps the Control Collar is set in place and modifications are made in propulsion and guidance. I... thought I had discovered all they had done to Moya. Obviously, I had not. Pilot, don't blame yourself. I'm afraid even with the clorium there will not be enough time to complete the separation before Moya succumbs to her own intense weight. Okay, clorium... Fertilizer? This stuff could have been made on Earth. Okay, maybe not. Crichton! Shh! yeah, I'm here. Where are you? Where are you guys? I'm in some kind of barn. - I'm with D'argo. - Fine. You go. We're half a metra from the ship - still drawing fire from the locals. Have you got the clorium yet? No, not yet. I'd feel a whole lot better if we could hook up again. Where are you guys? Who's there? Who are you? What are you doing around my mom's stuff? Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. Where are you from? Um, I'm from a long... long way away. You're from space? Yeah. I guess I am. So what's your name? Fostro. Well Fostro, my name is John. Fostro, wait! wait! Mom! Mom! It's not a weapon. I'm putting it down. Just... putting it down. Fostro? Is that your mom? - Mom! - No! Fostro, no! I can't move. Fostro... I am in the middle of what could be a very real extraterrestrial event. This is not the moment for you to... Why can't I move? I can't feel my body! Oh, my Gods. All my bones are... I'm going to recover from this, right? Completely, right? Fostro, get back. Not another... step. Please, I already told your boy I'm not here to harm you. Where are you from? He's from space. He must have come down in that thing you were tracking last night. My name is John Crichton and I'm from... I'm talking to an alien? You're an alien, and I'm talking to you? In my kitchen? You got to call somebody, Mom. Go outside. Get in the wheeler. Get in the wheeler now. Outside. Now. Hey, wait, you don't think we came alone, do you? If we wanted to contact some government, some agency we would have. We chose you. If this is about me climbing around in the ship's entrails then you can simply turn 'round and go back the way you came. With permission, your eminence. Yes. Pilot's done all that he can but the device won't allow a DRD or anything metal near it. We can't wait till the others return. We have to start the separation procedure immediately. And what about the great ship's pain? Among my sect, I am a ninth-level Pa'u. A priest of that level can harbor the power to... share another being's pain. If you are willing to begin the procedure I'll do all that I can to alleviate Moya's discomfort. This... is an awfully big ship. Don't I know it. Careful, Peacekeeper. Peacekeeper. If I were still a Peacekeeper, would I be sitting on this planet next to you? It's been long enough. I say we go. Not quite yet. Those hounds are still out there. They could track us down in a second. Oh, fine. Let's just perch here and do nothing then. Listen, Aeryn, if you have a problem with my strategy... Oh, I should have known that this would be Luxan strategy. It's probably why you did so well against the Grisoldians. Grisoldians? What do you know of them? Oh, everyone knows about that battle. How the Luxans went screaming into retreat so fast... Those monsters murdered thousands of Luxan women and children. We had no alternative but to retreat. We soon took our revenge. Mmm, and murdered thousands of their women and children. We had no alternative to that either. Mmm, I'm sure the Grisoldians said the same thing. I'm here because I need something something for my ship. Where is your ship? It's not far from here. There are others like you? Like me? Well, there are others, yeah. My readings flew way off the chart. The whole town is buzzing about this... giant something that flew in low over Kazda's Swamp. That's where your ship is- Kazda's Swamp. Mom, we got to tell. Fostro! Look, I understand what a phenomenal moment this is for you. Do you? Can you? I mean, to you, space travel is commonplace but to us here... I mean, in one flash... You've learned that you're not alone in the universe. That interstellar space travel's possible. That a zillion of your empirical facts about science, religion are wrong, or... completely suspect. I do understand. I'm not... exactly what you expected, am I? I always thought that when we finally made contact- first contact- the beings we'd meet would be so radically different. You're so much like us. Yeah, it's a real kick in the pants, ain't it? So, have you been... searching long? Since I was Fostro's age. My parents bought me a telescope. I used to look up at the stars at night and dream about... this moment. You said you chose me. Well, we saw the radio telescopes and... we figured you might be somebody who'd understand us, not hurt us. Hoped you would be. You have, uh, star charts... and deep-space photographs? Yeah. There's a... chance I might recognize something- constellations, galaxies. I might even get a fix on the Milky Way maybe even Earth. Don't you even know where you are? Are you in position? Yes, I'm in position. What is this thing I have to cut with? Well, you can't use a metal tool. I found that in D'argo's quarters. I believe it's made from bone. oh! This is a Tokaar knife. Do you know what ceremony young Luxan males use this for? On themselves? At that... certain age? Then I suspect that D'argo will want it back unharmed. Are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. Moya, I will take your pain. You may begin. Here goes. Continue. Rygel, you must continue. This place reminds him of home. What? Crichton. He says that this primordial rock actually reminds him of his Earth. No interplanetary travel, retrograde technology, fossil fuel-burning ground vehicles. He is a savage. Hmm. Does that bother you? No. Of course not. Look, he's had plenty of time to find the clorium. I'm going back. Signal me immediately if he's there. And if he's not there? I will go find him. You think I will not? I think I'll be searching for both of you in less than an arne. Fostro, it's almost ready. But, mom, I'm not hungry. You haven't had breakfast and you're going to eat! So, you, uh... work for some kind of school? University? Military. They provide most of my funding what's left of it. According to them, it's highly unlikely you even exist. You're my biggest concern. I'm not quite sure how they'd treat you if they knew you were here. Our military isn't the most compassionate, tolerant group. No. Militaries rarely are. So I'd be a real coup for you? Walking, talking evidence of extraterrestrial life? Yeah, I'd say my funding would be pretty much set for life. Fostro? I made some for you. Uh, I don't know if you eat. Don't even know if you're hungry. Hell, for all I know this stuff could be horribly toxic for you. Aah! What was that? Oh, no, no, no, it's just an analyzer. It's a science tool. It tells me there's some of what I need somewhere near here. It's in the food? How can it be in the...? Look, I'm looking for an element called clorium. It's what I'm looking for and there's got to be some somewhere here in this... What the hell is this? What is this? Gee, I'm... I'm sorry. Look, whatever is in this container... this is what my ship needs. It's the military. Lyneea? Fostro, take him to your room. - Go! - But, mom... - No. You don't have to do... - Go! Moya is in intense pain. Zhaan? Zhaan! Zhaan! Pilot, I think Zhaan is... Pilot? Pilot? Pilot! Wake up! Wake up you worthless weak shank of blue flesh! Are you there? Are you there? Pilot? Anyone there? Yes, of course, we're here. I've been screaming my shaltan head off! Moya is succumbing. She's collapsing. You know, when I was your age, I used to dream of meeting a real, live alien. Yeah. Me, too. Your phone's broken? I dropped it in all the excitement when we thought... "Thought" nothing. We had confirmation this time. Mount Versant observatory says that something definitely punched through the upper atmosphere last night. This means so little to you? I just remember last year. Versant declared a definite U.E.O. sighting. Turned out to be a terrestrial anomaly. Anomaly? That's not what you reported earlier. I just want to be sure. I need more time to check my data. There is definitely something out there, Lyneea. Civilians have seen it. This is the day you prove all of us who doubted you wrong. I don't understand. When you first contacted me you were extremely excited about your readings. I'm still excited. No. You're nervous. It looks like they're making this their base of operations. Well, it's standard procedure during an actual event and they know it's real this time. Commander Ryymax was asking where you were. You'd better go out there or he'll get suspicious. Does he have to? You say nothing. You understand me? He's not going to...? Look, there's a very good chance I'm going to get captured here, right? Well, before I am I at least need to let my ship know about this. But it's only onlux. Just onlux. It is what they need. Here, Aeryn! Here! What's wrong? We need to take off immediately. The ship is collapsing and Pilot is refusing to follow my commands. Zhaan. We've run out of time. We need to remove the device right now. If you do it, you do it without me. You're the only one small enough. Come on. Wait outside. Please. Let me. Your greatest fear will come to pass, Hynerian. Someday you will die at the hands of a Peacekeeper. As though you'll get the chance before we're all crushed or I kill the ship myself. You're afraid. You're afraid this great ship will die. I don't know what I'm doing. I've always had others to do for me. Even in prison, I... I don't even know how to hold a tool. There is great pain in this for all of us, isn't there? Come. We'll face the pain together. Will he do it? I believe so. I have something that'll heal that. Later. We deal with the ship first. Of course. What's taking him so long? Give him a moment. It's a big responsibility riding on those not-so-large shoulders. Are you truly able to take away the ship's pain? This entire ship? I only share the pain. I'm afraid that Moya still bears the larger portion. I don't know how she's doing it. What about how you're doing it? Are you laughing at me? Ah, no, no my dear. I'm not laughing. You just seemed very briefly to be concerned for me. I'm concerned only that you're able to complete your undertaking to share Moya's pain. Yes, of course. We're going to need biological containment. No, we haven't trapped anything yet but I want us to be 100% ready when we do. Yes, I said when. A "wormhole"? That's what we call it. Well, I know the phenomenon you're talking about. We call it a "ribbonhole." Although, theoretically, they don't really exist. Well, they didn't exist for me, either till I got sucked down one. So, you don't even know where your home is? I have no idea. You didn't really chose me, did you? No. Okay, listen, I've routed this through the main dishes outside. It's as strong as I can get it and it's very broadband. Aeryn, D'argo, are you there? Can you guys read me, Aeryn? Are you out there, D'argo? Crichton... Crichton, is that you? How is your signal getting through? Our comms will not penetrate the mud. Moya is bearing up... Is this guy more what you were expecting? Sir, you've got to come, quick! Now, sir! Crichton are you... - Mom! - Fostro! Another one! They've captured another one! Restrain him! Sorry, Moya, but I have to cut fast. Fostro. Wrong move. We found him less than a half a milon from here. Look at him. He's phenomenal. You and Fostro are going to have to get out of the area immediately. It's no longer safe for you here. Is he all right? What kind of ship are you? That thing on the computer in there and now this one trying to pull down my barn? You said you were a scientist a science ship. I am a scientist. My ship is... it's a prison transport. Escaped prisoners. Prisoners? Yeah. You...? No, it's a... galactic misunderstanding. Here. Take your precious onlux and get out of my house. Go now! Not without my friend. Oh, it's too late for him. He's going to be laid open on an autopsy table by dawn tomorrow. That's what I've been trying to protect you from. I won't go without him. "Only if you want to go." Get me back. Get me back. Rygel, get it done in there. Your encouragement is much appreciated. It just started coming up. I was recalibrating, and all of a sudden it started... Wait till you see it, Ryymax. It is unbelievable. Watch. Watch this. Crichton? Crichton, is that you? How is your signal getting through? Our comms will not penetrate the mud. Moya is bearing up. Pa'u Zhaan is helping all she can but we need the clorium. Do you have a fix on the origin of this signal? Zeta team, move out. Stay back, boy. You took your time. Hey, kid. Want to shake his hand? Go ahead. He doesn't bite. See? Here. This is yours. Ryymax and his men are off searching Akon's Field. It's in the opposite direction of the swamp. I wish there was more I could do. You've altered the perceptions and beliefs of an entire planet. Yeah. I guess that's enough for one day. Crichton, we must go. It will be dark soon. We may not find our way back. Keep watching the skies. That's how you people say good-bye? What? Your people don't do that? Good-bye... D'argo. You are the luckiest nine-year-old around. Someday you are going to have a very singular story to tell. You can't tell it for a long time, of course, but someday. Oh, blast. Rygel! Pilot! Pierce. Pierce. Pierce. Aeryn! Crichton, where are you?! We're back! D'argo and I are back! Pilot, prepare for liftoff! I can't. What do you mean you can't?! The pain along the neural nexus is too great. I can't get control of Moya's propulsion systems. Just hold on. We're coming down. Hurry, will you?! Hurry! It's done. It's done. The beacon is no longer broadcasting. I did it. I did it. I did it! Yo Rygel- start spreading this around, everywhere you can. Your attention. Prepare to liftoff. As Moya has never done this before I don't know what to expect. Oh. Hmm. Hmm... Hmm. Zhaan... Zhaan. It's done. Ouch. Aeryn, let's go. Oh, oh. Oh, never, ever again. We're free! We're going to make it. Don't tell me you're going to miss that rock. No, not that rock.
