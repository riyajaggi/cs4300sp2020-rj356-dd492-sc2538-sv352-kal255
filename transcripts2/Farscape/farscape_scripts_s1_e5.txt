 Pilot, blast us out of here. Agreed. We may be in danger, too. But there may be survivors. Someone still aboard. We'll drink to honor their memories later but we leave here now. Do we have a consensus? - Reverse course. - Closer. Leave here now. Is there a problem? Damn. Who does that belong to? Don't know, don't care.

 It's subatomically disintegrating, John. No idea what's causing it. Reason enough to stay clear. What is that? Attention! Transmission coming in. Please... help us. Power's malfunctioning. Life support... gone. Pilot... bring that ship aboard. But you said yourself we may be... Do it. We have our consensus, Pilot.

 Deploy the docking web. Deploying the web. Hurry up, Crichton. Their ship's in trouble. Come on. I got you. Hang on. Come on, hang on. I'm going to check the shuttle for others. Crichton. There's no one else aboard. There's no one else aboard. Yeah, I heard you the first time. My name is John Crichton, an astronaut... ...a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole... Mow I'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship- a living ship full of strange alien life-forms... Help me, help me... Listen, please. Is there anybody out there who can hear me? ...being hunted by an insane military commander... ...doing everything I can... I'm just looking for a way home. We must be able to do something. There may be others on that cruiser. Not anymore. We weren't even aware that was a malfunction until the phase couplers overloaded. By then, all we could do was evacuate. Fortunately, Matala and I were the only crew. Are you hurt? Oh, no, no, no, just a little tingly. Must have touched a live wire or something. Half the shuttle's power conduits had ruptured. I've shut those circuits down. The cargo's fine. No damage to its containment. What is the cargo? Do you expect me to tell a Peacekeeper? Well, she's retired, sort of. We have all escaped from the Peacekeepers. She is one of us now. Yes. So, your cargo? Scientific apparatus would be more accurate. We have been studying deep space gravitational fluctuations. We were on our way to rendezvous with another cruiser not too far from here. If you could take us there... Of course. Our ship is yours. You honor us Ka D'argo. You'll need the coordinates of our rendezvous point. Our guidance station is this way. Ah. Rest and revitalize. I'll take care of it. Thank you. Ooh. Something the matter? Um... No. Just, I just had a, uh... Whew, I don't know what I just had. Well, perhaps you need to rest and revitalize, too. Yeah. I guess that's a good idea. The coordinates are now locked in. How soon can we get there? Pilot will let us know soon enough. Of course, the real question is... what's it worth to you? Bearing in mind, of course, that we've already saved your lives. Yes, you have, and we're most appreciative. Then you'll want to express that appreciation before we agree to... No bargains. What? These are my friends. Friends? You? You've only just met them. My friends are Ilanics, genetic cousins to the Luxans. Our races have been blood allies for over 1,000 cycles. We shall extend them every courtesy. Is that clear? You must excuse the Hynerian. His manners match his size. We will reach that location in twelve arnes. Perfect. And the cruiser shall reach us there soon after. Is there anything I can offer you in the meantime to eat or to drink? For myself, no, but I'd like to get Verell to eat something. Will you accompany me? More, Verell? No, thank you. So, you, Zhaan and Rygel escaped Peacekeeper imprisonment and commandeered this ship? I have left out one part. The crime for which I was imprisoned. Was it treason? No. It... Then I don't need to hear of it. Matala and I owe you our lives. Whatever your past, exile from your own kind is atonement enough. How long has it been? Nearly eight cycles. If you've been out of contact for eight cycles then you haven't heard, the Ilanic Sector is at war. The Scorvians? Yes. Three cycles ago, they attacked an outlying colony. Completely unprovoked. Slaughtered two million civilians. We've been fighting ever since. Massive casualties, and no end in sight. And the Luxans? Do they fight at your side? Your people have been more than generous with troops, armaments. Far beyond what our mutual treaty requires. How can I help you now? Luxans truly are the best allies one could want. Just getting us to the rendezvous point will help the war effort more than you can know. Get away from that hatch! What's inside there? We've already told you, very sensitive equipment that contains a cycle's worth of complex sensor readings. Hmm. Well I'd like to see it. I said, get away... Ah. You've had some training. Care to test it? Is there a problem here? I was just scanning for those broken power conduits she mentioned. I thought that if I could identify them, the Drds could repair them. I never asked you to fix anything. Well, I took it upon myself. Please, D'Argo, if anything were to happen to our data, all our hard work would be lost. Surely an operational pod is of much more use to us... We respect their wishes. I do not want to see you in here again. Fine. I'll leave you both to it. She will not return. That someone would send a cruiser with only two scientists all the way out here just for research? There are many species who seek... Were you going to say something? No. Well, yes. I'm... I'm... Sorry, I just went somewhere else for a second there. Uh... you were saying? Oh. I just don't trust them. The female especially. Matala? W-why not? Well, she's clearly leading D'argo around by his mivonks and I think she's having some sort of an effect on you. Me? That's B.S. She's an entirely different species. We could never... John... hold still. You'll like this. Hold still. Is something wrong, John? Something's happening and I... Something like I've just been... I'm just going to get some air. We have air in here. What is the matter with him? He is Crichton. Ah. D'argo. Come in, please. I do not want to disturb you. Not at all. Don't forget, for nearly a cycle my only companion has been Matala. Some would find that situation most desirable. Ah. Then you find her desirable? Please forgive me, I had no right to... There's nothing to forgive. Matala's a colleague, nothing more. If you want her, then by all means, begin the Luxan chase. I, uh... I couldn't. As you prefer. It's clear she wants you. D'argo. It's so kind of you to let us borrow your workbench. Are you repairing something? Uh, building something. Could it be a shilquen? How did you know? Oh, I've always taken a special interest in Luxan objects. The workmanship is exquisite. Your hands are quite skilled. D'argo! It's... Oh. Oh, uh, hi. Friend. Crichton. Hey can I talk to you? Yeah. Uh... Now. Trouble. Listen, D'argo... Ilanics are related to Luxans, right? So you know all about them. We're distantly related. All right, well, Ilanic women... when it comes to attracting men do they have any...? Um... What? Special pheromones? You know, body chemistry that acts like a, uh, an aphrodisiac? - No. - Well, how ab... how about mental abilities? Do they have, like, telepathic powers of seduction? Psychic Spanish Fly? You know, that? Why do you ask? Look. No, no, this has nothing to do with you but... I've been having these flashes and I'm somewhere else and Matala's there. All right? You know, we're like... getting horizontal. Vertical. It's... Huh? You... and Matala? Yeah. I don't know, it's crazy. I mean, are we even compatible? I don't know but... like... it's real. I can feel her, I can touch her. You are fantasizing about her. Remove her from your thoughts. Trust me, I'm trying. Hey. Hey, check the attitude, pal. She's not my type! - Where is he? - Who? D'argo. Is he still behaving like Verell and Matala's personal servant? Personal servant? That's new. What...? - Where is he? - Who? D'argo. Is he still behaving like Verell and Matala's personal servant? Did you hear me? Yeah, I heard you fine. Twice. You are very odd, Crichton. That just happened. That was real. That happened. Which means... I'm not hallucinating, so if... if I'm not hallucinating, then... I'm seeing the future. Oh boy. That's the future. Okay, John, don't freak. Get a grip, man. You don't know you've come unstuck in time. D'argo, wait! Oh, thank God you're okay. Look, man, you can't go in there. Why not? Because Matala's in there and she's going to try to kill you... me... us... and stab Verell. She might have already done it. Crichton, you disgust me. Do you think this clumsy ruse will turn me away from Matala? No, no, no. It's not a ruse. I know it sounds crazy but... You want her and you'll do anything to get her. I do not want Matala. Would you listen to me? Look, open your ears, or your tentacles, or whatever orifice it is you listen with. I think the woman is dangerous. Verell... Where is Matala? She just left with the Peacekeeper, Aeryn. I have brought you some Contala tea. Most kind of you. Bring it right in. This is not happening. It's not... It's just not happening. It's... I'm glad you're joining me. Me, too. And I'm really in the mood for some physical activity. John. Aeryn's invited me to partake in some physical conditioning with her. Good. That's good. That's real good. So you'll be down in the cargo bay, right? Yes. As usual. For a while, right? Yes. As long as she can keep up. How is your hand? Come, if you're coming. Rygel. Uh-oh! Zhaan, did you see how much food D'argo gave those Ilanics? Well, he's not getting my share. You've been aboard Moya longer than anyone else except Pilot. Your point being? You know her sounds and her rhythms. Just stop and listen to her for a moment. All right. Moya sounds fine. Does she? Not to me. Something feels... out of balance. I suppose Peacekeepers don't need to know that much. Their females have no need for science or culture or even the art of attracting males. Unlike females who can only achieve their goals by seducing male after male. Guess we both have our unique talents. More? Or are we through here? I thank you for the exercise. Matala? The first symptoms of trouble you had with your ship, what were they? Verell told you. We knew nothing until the phase couplers overloaded. Think back. Slight irregularities that meant nothing to you? We noticed nothing. And what does it matter now? Our ship is gone. Perhaps Verell will help. I'm sure he'll be glad to help you, when he's free. And while we wait, you can help me. Yes? I'm curious about Crichton. Far too complex, I'm afraid, for you to know in the short time that you'll be here. I suggest you shouldn't try. Now, I really must speak with Verell. I don't blame you for being concerned, especially after what happened to my ship. You said the problem was phase related, and didn't become apparent until it was too late to fix. But it was caused by a malfunction in our core regulator. A subsystem that Leviathans like Moya do not possess. In fact, I doubt that Moya's phase imbalance actually exists. Probably a sensor synapse out of calibration. D'argo, Matala... to interrupt these future events I got to prevent... I need to keep people from-from-from seeing each other. Must you gibber while I'm eating, or at all? Damn. I don't think so. I'm on a ship of lunatics. John, what is it? This is going to take a lot of explaining. But do it in private. We weren't here to research but to field test a new weapon... one that could end our agonizing war against the Scorvians. This weapon is so powerful that it requires a containment field. We didn't realize this until our cruiser had malfunctioned. By the time we got it working, it was too late. Luckily, we were able to save the weapon. It's in our shuttle. Is Moya in any danger? No. The containment field will protect her and us. Why didn't you tell me this before? Didn't you trust me? You are a Luxan, but you also are, were, a prisoner. We cannot be certain of your loyalties. Are you now? We need you, D'argo. Whatever the risk to this ship, it must be taken. Without this weapon millions more Ilanic lives will be lost. Can we count on you? Yes. Believe me, I know how crazy it all sounds. Premonitions. Future flashes. The concept is a fascinating one. Yeah, well, it could just still be a concept, you know. I could just be going plain old bonkers here. But I guess it's about time for that to happen. If these future flashes are indeed occurring as you say, John, then you could simply alter the sequence of events and change the future. I thought of that. Yeah, just lock myself in my room wait for them to leave. But Matala could still murder Verell and D'argo, if that's what she intends to do. I just don't know why she would want to kill us. I don't know what the game is. Oh, hell. I'm sorry. That's all right, John. Zhaan, you said you didn't quite buy Verell's explanation for the phase imbalance, right? Not entirely. Well, I think it's time the old goat spilled his guts. Verell! You've been lying to... to us... us. Why would he do that? Where's Verell? You need to calm down. Rest and revitalize. I have a technique that just might... Back off, nature girl. Keep your hands to yourself. Now, you tell me what really happened to your ship. And why are you trying to kill Verell?! D'argo... help me. He knows the truth. He threatened to tell the others, make them turn against me unless I pleasured him. Oh, she's lying! I never... D'argo, what are you doing? Matala! If these future flashes are indeed occurring as you say, John, then you could simply alter the sequence of events and change the future. I- I-I-I... I just did. I just did. I changed the future, and I made it worse! I'm... sorry. That's all right, John. Again. Don't you get it? Ge... I just had another look into the future and this time, instead of Matala snapping my neck D'argo skewers me with his Qualta Blade. So, according to this premonition D'argo will kill you? Yeah, yeah. I think the Ilanics have turned him around somehow. I don't know. I will talk to him. Talk? What, are you giving me a character reference?! I just felt the blade slice through my guts, okay?! I just found something out. Matala is not Ilanic. She's Scorvian. Her Ilanic appearance must be the result of genetic surgery. How do you know this? Because she fights like a Scorvian. The workout, y-you set that up? You saw her moves? So, like, you saw the... Scorvian Neural Stroke, yeah. How do you know about that? Yeah, well, I saw it in the future. What do you mean? Look, just... you know what? Ask me later. Just ask me later, when I got more time. Of course, I could be dead three or four times by the time you ask, but... Crichton's right. We may not have much time. If Matala truly is a Scorvian agent, then perhaps she's only with Verell to spy on him. No, "spy," no, no, no. Kill... and I guarantee you, Verell's research, it's a lot bigger than academic research and I think that D'argo knows about it. Look, enough talk. I say we confront them and force the truth out. No, we can't do that. No, because D'argo thinks that Verell and Matala are some kind of Ilanic angels. Then we separate them. We get D'argo and Matala out of there and talk to Verell alone. Once he understands that we're not the enemy, then... Zhaan? Zhaan? Yes, Pilot? I thought you'd want to know the phase imbalance in Moya's converters is getting worse. If there's a problem with Moya perhaps D'argo would be helpful in tracking it down. D'argo, we have a slight technical problem, something about a phase imbalance. Can you meet us in the Command, give us your assistance, please? I'll be right there. I'll lay odds, one of the noodleheads, they come up with D'argo and lay off this phase imbalance as insignificant. What if all three come up? There's no way they'll leave their shuttle unguarded. One of them will remain behind. Well, that'll be Verell. He's not going to leave his work. Watch. The others are worried about the core temperature on the pod. The imbalance can't be significant. They worry over nothing. Why can't we tell them that? What if they don't believe us? What if they demand to know more about what Verell is doing? The Scorvians are devious but I can assure you that no one aboard this ship is a Scorvian spy. Brave D'argo... you have already proven yourself a hundred times over. Tell me. Is it possible you'd ever consider joining us? What do you mean? Becoming a soldier for the Ilanic cause. Pledging to fight by our sides in the battle ahead. I wish I could do as you ask. But, um... it's not nearly as simple as that. Is it because of your crimes? Verell told me. He and I have no secrets. I did not tell Verell what my crime was. No one aboard this ship knows the real truth. It matters not what has come between you and your people. D'argo, war does not recognize multiple loyalties. On the battlefield, there is only them... and us. D'argo, I'm waiting for you. We should go. I'm on my way, Zhaan. Verell... Please, I'm extremely busy. These data correlations demand my total attention. Well, I suggest you refocus your total attention 'cause there's some crap going down that just might be of interest to you. "Crap"? Yes, crap. Crap like I know you're not out here in the uncharted territories doing research. Crap like you have enemies called the "Scorpions" and that your trusted colleague Matala is a spy for them, who as best I can tell, is dead set on killing you. You're talking nonsense. Yeah, well, my entire life has become nonsense, so I suggest you listen to me because if I'm right, it means that all of your research... ends up in the hands of your enemy. So, D'argo and I, we pulled you two out of the shuttle. I go back in and I get zapped by some loose wire or something. You remember that? Vaguely. Well, ever since then I've been having these time flashes. Into the future. Temporal dislocation. Excuse me? Ah... Entropic oscillations... Anomalous phase signatures... That would account for the dislocation you are experiencing. "Temporal dislocation"? You must've been exposed to... Exposed to what? What you said about Matala. What makes you believe that? What exactly did you see in the future? Exposed to what? What's in the damn shuttle? A quantum singularity. A black hole? A minute particle of one, yes. Its power and application are unimaginable. It is the ultimate weapon. You capture a piece of black hole... and you're going to use it as a weapon? My species' very existence depends on it. If you are right about Matala, she will kill for it. "Right about Matala," Verell? In what way? Explain yourself. What has he told you? That you are not who you say you are. That you are a Scorvian impostor. Oh, Verell... you can't... Aeryn, now. Get your ass in here! Now, Aeryn! Matala... D'argo! Crichton, she sealed the doors. What happened? Aeryn. Matala, she's making a run for it. Not if I can help it. No! Oh God! If these future flashes are indeed occurring as you say, John, then you could simply alter the sequence of events and change the future. Oh, man, it just happened again. What did? A premonition? I've just found something out. Yes. Yes, we know. Matala is not Ilanic. She's a Scorvian in disguise. Matala a Scorvian? How did you find out? He says he is experiencing the future. The future? You can barely function in the present. If Matala truly is a Scorvian, then she is with Verell to... Spy on him and to kill him. Look, I've already lived through all this. Well, whatever's going on I say we confront them and force them... Doesn't work. Then we separate them and... Been there, done that. It's not going to work. Zhaan? Yes, Pilot, we know. The phase imbalance is getting worse. That's correct. No, not now, Pilot. D'argo. The key is D'argo. Okay? D'argo is the key. As long as he is with Matala the timeline keeps getting worse and worse. We got to talk to him alone. We got to get him away from Matala. We cannot ask him to come up to the Command and deal with the phase imbalance because he's going to bring Matala with him. We have got... We've got to try something new. Ready for transport, D'argo. Hold still. I'm sorry to disturb you, D'argo. But could you speak to Rygel? Now what's he done? He has presented a bill for the rescue and transportation of our guests. He intends to present it to the Ilanics when we rendezvous. My people would be more... I won't hear of it. I've explained this to him before. I will explain it to him again. Excuse me. Where is that Hynerian bandit? Where is he? Where is he! Yes, that definitely solves the containment field instability problem. How much time until the rendezvous? Sooner than you think. And you believe these premonitions of crimes are genuine? He is convincing enough. We need to subdue Matala as a precaution if nothing else. And we need to get that shuttle out of Moya ASAP. Listen, D'argo, I wish to God Matala was telling you the truth that you could go off with her and join the Ilanic wars. What are you talking about? Oh, you haven't had that conversation. Look, Matala's going to offer you that to keep you off balance and to distance you from us. I don't believe any of this. It's you who are trying to distance me from them. D'argo, please, if what Crichton is saying is so... Well, it isn't so! Leave us alone. Let me talk to him in private. Crichton, are you sure? There is no more to say. Just go. Go. There is nothing you can say to me... Would you shut up and you listen to me?! In that future conversation when Matala offers you to go to the Ilanic wars, you tell her it isn't possible. You tell her that your crime, the crime that you were imprisoned for, would stand in the way. And not the crime that you told us. Not the crime that you say you were in prison for, but the real crime. The crime that you've been keeping secret from everybody on board this ship. How do you know that? You can't. Well, I do know... and I'm telling you the truth. D'argo, Matala is the enemy. Look, I'm sorry. Crichton, there's a vessel approaching. It's the Ilanic cruiser. We're still some distance from the rendezvous point. It is an Ilanic cruiser. Or looks like one. Like Matala, it might be Scorvian on the inside. How fast can we starburst out of here? We'll be in her gun range long before Moya's ready. Can we outrun her without starburst? No, but I can outmaneuver her and keep her from a weapons lock. Zhaan, talk to em. See if you can distract em. See if you can figure out who they are. Scorvians look nothing like Ilanics. If they refuse to make visual contact. You have your answer. In which case, I start dodging. Matala. D'argo, wait! We got to play this smart. Communication coming through. Greetings. We regret that our comm system has a malfunction. Permission to dock and come aboard? Don't even bother responding, Zhaan. Pilot. I've got it, Pilot. Verell! Stand away from her. D'argo, what's wrong? Who are you, Matala? Who are you, really? What is the meaning of this? What are you going to do, D'argo? Shoot me? If I have to. If the approaching ship proves to be a Scorvian vessel. No, D'argo. You'll see. The coming ship, it's Ilanic. D'argo, trust your heart. Your heart knows the truth. You can trust me. No! Keep back! I'll kill him. Matala? Shut up! D'argo, drop the rifle! Drop the rifle! Kick it towards me now! Matala, why are you doing this? She's Scorvian. My word as a Luxan. My turn. D'argo, leave it! No! You try to stop her with this thing, you're going to kill us all. You have to trust me. Black hole... Black hole... must destroy... before Scorvians... Pilot, I need starburst and I'm talking right now. All clear. Matala. Sorry. I should have seen it coming. Rygel. Little camper! You look good, man. Gee, what is that smell? Whew! Tail end of a food binge, I'm afraid. Very difficult to stop when you get going. Which bit of me looks good, exactly? The bit that's not jumping back and forth in time. Food cube? Food cube?! Food cube?! Hey, how are you doing? I will recover. Yeah, when? Do you mock me? D'argo, I mock all of us. You know, you're not the first to have his head snapped off by a chick. I do not want to talk about it. Fine. But I'm right. My personal life is not for discussion. This is a stupid question, but do you consider your true crime part of your personal life? I don't want to talk about it. Crichton, I am normally unaffected by females during a crisis. It's just... it has been so long. Oh, that... I understand. Man, do I understand.
