 Good friends. - Cheers. - Yes, cheers. - Lovely. - Yes, come on! This is your night. No, Jenny. Haven't you heard enough of me for one day? - We want a speech, love. - Alright. Fine. As the way-too-lucky recipient of this old-age award... Lifetime achievement award. Oh, whatever! I have one person to thank. Me. Well, of course. Who else?

 Honestly, though, A, I'm bloody lucky to still have a job and B, everything - and I mean everything - the silliness, the lovely trips, the joys, the sorrows - none of it would mean anything without my favourite person. My morning, my day. My night, my rock, my Ray. This is your lifetime achievement. We all want more time. More love. More life. And it's what connects us - our human desires. Whoo! It's what consumes us.

 This... time. And I get that. I understand that. - Because it's easy. - Whoo! Yeah! Get down! And it's all we can see. What's right in front of us. Get down! Stop it! The bird in the hand. More wealth. More possessions. More luxurious island holidays. But it is a trap to believe in the here and now. Because this is just a blip. A test. A trial. And only then will we be rewarded with eternal life. Millions and billions of infinite days, just waiting for us in the glory of His kingdom. It's the promise our creator has given us. But you only get that miracle... that ultimate prize, if you are at one with God. And I know it's not always easy. Trust me. I know. And we are constantly tempted - by the devil, by vices and sin. - At every turn. - And who created sin? Sorry? He created everything. Including Adam, who committed the original sin. So... it's God's fault. I mean, He's responsible. I mean... shouldn't He be accountable? I'm not here to judge. I'm just sayin'. That's the devil, Donnie. Yeah but he's a fallen angel. That God also created! So God... created sin! Glad we cleared that up. Hallelujah! Oh, god. Oh! {\an8}- Looked a lot better in the photographs. - Perfect! {\an8}Fresh start. OK. {\an8}No! Hey, hey. Wait a minute. I've got it. No. {\an8}- Oh! - I've got it all. {\an8}- You're welcome. - That's... {\an8}- This one? - Yeah, come on. Load me up. {\an8}- There. Saddle up. - Yeah. We're... all good. {\an8}I've got this. - Mum... - I know. It's a pain. I promised his parents we'd look after him while they're overseas. It won't be for long. Is it because of the cigarettes? Monique gave them to me. - I would never have smoked them... - Honey, no! I'm not punishing you. I'm helping us. I just forgot what is most important and that is you and me together, OK? And I know it's hard to understand but... I'm saving our lives. Excuse me. Father. - Hi. - Hi. Shane, isn't it? Yeah. How did you know? Uh, it's pretty easy to spot you out of three people. Oh. Right. Yeah. I mean... I get it. Well, I've nearly set this all up but, uh, this is for you. Well, for everyone, really, especially us fellas. Yeah. I mean... I get... Yeah. I've been meaning to... do a bit of... Or just to talk. Just chill out. See... Yeah. I mean, that... that's... That... that'd be good, 'cause it's been a pretty... shit year, actually. Might... might... might be good to talk to someone. It takes real guts to admit that you need help. Uh... You know, I... I just can't. I'm sorry. Mate! Hello? Mrs Reed? Oh. Shit! Come on! Come on, keep up! Keep up. Slow down! Luke! Where are you going? I win! Luke 1, Eva 0. - Whatever. - Maybe next time. Oh, cool. Check that out. What are you doing? - This is how people die. - No, this is how people live! Don't be an idiot! Stop! Whoa! Oh! Come on! Come on. Try it, try it! It's safe. I dare you. Oh, come on! Come on. It's glorious. Hi! God. Hey. Where's, um... where's Eva? Oh, we're out, um... we're out hangin'. Hangin', like kids. - Were they home? - No. And it looks like they haven't been there for a while. It's not your job to bond with Eva, alright? You just do as I tell you. Yeah, I know. It's all about our deal, right? Why are you soaked? I went to the river. It's beautiful here. But you know what? You know, I don't think that, uh... I don't think you've ever looked sexier than you do right now. Oh, god! - Come on. - No! Oh, come on, please. Please. Annie, look. You don't even have to touch me. You don't have to move. I... Please. Come on. I've been going crazy without you, Annie. Oh! Please, Annie. Let me just... Oh, Annie... Oh, I've missed you. Oh, shit! Oh, shit. G'day. Hi, there. It's all a bit whiz-bang. Yep. And what exactly are you looking for? I'm a sustainable botanist, so I'm just collecting some samples, that's all. Unfortunately you can't take any of the indigenous flora without a... permit. Good on you. Benjamin Garnot. Is that French, is it? Uh, pff. So, what brings you to Mullan? I take it you're not a local. Why? Is that relevant? Just making a bit of polite chit-chat, mate. Could you open the back of your van for me, please? Again, why? Curiosity. And because I'm politely asking. Asking, yes. But you need to reasonably suspect illegal activity, which, based on the evidence here, I fail to understand. Ah, really? Really? Just so we're both accountable. You're getting on my nerves, mate. Alright. Well, good luck with your, um... botany. Thank you. See ya! Thank you for calling me, Father, but I... Look, I'm... This is absurd. Look, whatever my daughter told you... Mrs Carter, thank you for coming. - Please just... - Nothing happened. - OK. - Not that it's any of your business. So... He's 16, isn't he? Oh. Eva, he was being silly. Alright? He's been through so much and he's missing his own family. - Eva, come on. - Mrs Carter, this is my duty of care. - And clearly, Eva is still grieving... - She misinterpreted the... - grieving for her dad. - Situation. She's still clearly devastated. Oh. Right. Is she? Thank you for that. - Could you wait outside, please, Eva? - Eva can stay here. Wait outside, please, sweetheart. Mrs Carter. Anne... Father, I appreciate your concern for my friend's 16-year-old son. However ironic that might seem. It's deep, isn't it? This scar. Now, is it just grief or is it something else? Is this Catholicism or Voodoo? Because I'm not buying either. And I will tell you this once. You can stay away from my family. You have nothing to worry about with Luke! I promise you. He was just... playing around. You were talking to a priest! I mean, since when have you been even remotely religious? Well, there's a lot about me you don't know. Oh. Yeah. OK. Fine. No, well, listen... That's why we're here, OK? To reconnect. Eva! You know what I've been through, right? But you're all better now. Yes! Of course. But that's why we're here. So I can just get away from all the city noise and the toxic air and to keep healing. But you need to trust me. Come here. Oh, god. Oh. Is she OK? What the hell is this? Oh, you know, I was, um... I started searching the yard for the plant and I found all this. Do you remember Evie said she wanted a chicken? So now we can give her one and for you, fresh eggs every morning. OK. Whatever this is doing to you, you just need to calm down. Because if Eva sees you even so much as look at me again... I'm sorry. You wanted that too. You do exactly what I tell you or you can't stay here. Jesus Christ! You're my wife! No, ex-wife. Very much ex and let me tell you, that door is closed. - OK? - Come on, Anne... And Eva? She just told a priest that you're dead. So why don't you just stick to why we're here? This is business, OK? You play your part. When this... fades, you're gone, OK? Immediately. Understood? Hey. You look so pretty, Grandma. No way. That is so adorable. Bathers up to his belly button! You would seriously rock those, babe. - That's quite enough. - Sorry. Later. Gran, it must be so hard for you, losing Pops. I'm just thankful he went peacefully. Eating his dessert. Whoa! Jeez. Cool. What was it? And you know that Mum's gutted, right, that she couldn't be here for the funeral. Yes, I know she tried. But the flight from London's so expensive. Isabella, darling, what are you wearing? Oh. They're just denim shorts. It's OK. I have a dress. But we're here for you, OK? Me and Skeeter. You betcha. So, yeah, what... What was he eating? The... the other... the dessert? Apple crumble. Man. See? Come here. Come here. That is a beautiful way to go. Eh? More. Keep going. Left, right, right, left! Right, right, left. Keep breathing, Shane. - Oh! - One more. One more, one more. It's harder than it looks. You see, though? The next Ali. I'm glad you came back, Shane. You can come and train in here any time. Thanks. Those track marks look painful. It's a tough thing to break. The addiction. If you... ever need anything to take the edge off... you know, I have access. The nursing home. If... like, if you need anything. Yep. Anything. Shane... what's wrong? I was attacked. By this... by this woman, at work. This young, beautiful woman. You like to humiliate, yes? She tortured me. She tortured me. Now nothing works and I... I can't even get a hard-on. I can't... I can't look at a girl. And the weirdest thing is she was this young woman and then... she's old. Like... like a... Like, really old. She was both young and old. - Well... - Give me that. Alright. - Don't touch anything. - I won't. Oh. Whoa. Would you look at that? They look so happy. Mmm. How things change, huh? It's three months out of date. Oh, god. Another bloody dead end. Jeez. Oh, god. It's so weird. How these grow. From death, grief, came hope. Well, it's not here now. And if she died, it would have made the news, right? Yeah. OK. Then where is she? Look who I found. She was also feeling lonely. And I knew you'd take such good care of her. I will. Oh, my darling! I know how much you miss them. My own daughter, well... She's missing too. What happened? Well, I like to think that... Well, she was such an adventurous girl, always making up the most wonderful, crazy stories in her head. - Like me. - Yes. Just like you. Or I think. Well... G'day. - What can I... - Oh, hi. Is there a problem? Oh, just came to see how the new arrivals are faring. - Oh. - Mrs Carter, is it? Yes. Anne. Sergeant Stokes. Um... just wondering if I could have a moment. - Alone? - Yeah. What's this about? Oh, just want to have a quick chat to your... is it your mum? No, no. Luke's a family friend. Oh. Luke... Surname? Jamieson. - Ah. - Luke Jamieson. What's your date of birth, mate? Uh, September 13th. - 2004, right? - Right. - Look, is there a reason that you're... - You just go back in. Go in. Go on. Hurry up. Sorry. It's just... kids. - Go. Hurry up. - Sure. - Sweet sixteen, huh? - I know what this is about. It's just... I should never have snapped at the priest like that. But it was just, after what my daughter told him... It's a very serious accusation. Yes! It is! Uh... she's been through a lot. She's been uprooted, she's been through my cancer - I mean, I'm in remission now - and then there's the divorce... I mean, it's just... it's a lot to take on and this is just a really embarrassing... misunderstanding. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause any trouble. It was a mistake. I'll leave you to it. - Thank you for your concern. - Yeah. You've called Ray Reed. Please leave a message. Hey, Ray. It's Rhonda. Um, listen, I've just met this strange... kid and I'm... Uh... uh, actually, just scrap that. Um, and I'm probably just a bit jumpy, so, um, give us a call when you can and hope you're taking care of yourself, wherever you are. OK, mate. See ya. Hey. It's OK. - Issy asked me to come grab you. - I'm not an invalid. Rhonda. Thank you for coming. Oh, of course. My condolences. That is a beautiful aroma. Is that... is that lilac? No. Lavender. Hey, um, between you and me, I think that it sucks balls that Julie couldn't be arsed showing up. - I mean, I know... - I beg your pardon? I know it's secret family shit but she's your daughter and I could tell that you weren't buying any of that stuck-in-London crap. While Herb took great pride in teaching mathematics, perhaps his greatest achievement was proudly serving his country in Vietnam, as a wing commander in the Royal Australian Air Force. Herb rarely spoke about his war experiences. But close friends could attest... after a whiskey or two, how he loved to cut loose in a Phantom fighter at Mach 2. Because... we're all our own pilots, aren't we? And family - oh! What does that even mean? We're all just living for ourselves. For our own desires. No matter who we hurt around us. Oh. No, no, no, no. I'm fine. Oh, Loris... Don't touch me! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, yeah! Ooh, yeah! Oh! Quite the performance, isn't it? Yes, I know. Marvellous, isn't it? Out of the wheelchair and I'm able to reach up to that top shelf and get that nice china for you. If I was still alive. But I can still foxtrot. - Shall we? - Oh, yeah! Oh, a disgrace is what it is. How can Julie allow her to be with that creature? And apparently, she's dropped out of university. Huh! His influence, no doubt. Yeah. Uh, I take it the funeral didn't go so well, without Julie. Oh, Herb! - I'm so sorry. - That's alright. At least you made it memorable. Hmph! But it's your time now. Time to what? Shrivel up? To live. To unshackle yourself. Oh! Oh, yeah! If only I could have given you such passion. Oh, don't be so crass! - Oh! - Oh, yeah! Yeah! All-time top ten? - That week driving the Amalfi coast. - Mmm. With that French director, whatever his name was, who was all over you. Oh, Alphonse! He was, wasn't he? No, that'd be my 176. - Really? - Yeah. - My ten. - Mmm? Opening night of your first West End play, when we all slipped into that little wine bar round the corner - remember that? Ah! My three - first time we, um... Mm-hmm. In the back of your EJ Holden. My five - your graduation. My two - your laugh. My two - your bloody optimism, even when everything's going to shit. To you, there's always a silver lining. There always is. Hmm. Oh, it's so hot in there. There's no air. You alright? Look, we've gotta talk about this, right? If this really isn't gonna wear off, then it's a jackpot. For you. Jackpot for you. Jackpot... for us. How's this gonna end, then? You're not nursing me into the grave - and that's what will happen. So what? It's OK for you to nurse me four years when I didn't even know who you were but it's not OK for me to do the same for you? That's... that's not fair. That's ridiculous. You're a very beautiful young woman. Look at me. - We've gotta be realistic. - I'll tell you what's realistic! You're my husband, Ray! Then that's it. We need to go home. We need to get you a berry. I know! I know it... it didn't work last... last time but... I think this time it'll be different. - Yeah. - I mean, it's stronger. Even for the man with no regrets. But there are none. There are no more left. You don't know that for sure. There might be others. And we can't take the risk of people seeing you like that. You have to try. You owe me that! You did this to me, remember? I didn't want you to suffer. Fine. You stay here and I'll go get you one myself. Gwen... Gwen! Gwen! My one... Maybe this. My one... is yet to come. We'll go in the morning. Thank you. It's just to... shut down my brain. Right. Look, Annie, I... I know you still feel something. Even though you're trying not to. We have a chance to reboot. Because I literally have. It's like when we first met, in, uh, Miss Bolton's chem class. Room 2C. True love over a Bunsen burner. And then flash forward to you shagging half your office. Now just get out of here. Go. Now. I'm sorry, Annie. Hello? Hi. Don't you knock? Not when I'm paying you this much. You just got up? Yeah. After 30 hours of working straight, I had two hours sleep. Sorry. - And? - Thank you. And if you're gonna touch my shit, can you put some gloves on? I've searched all the sites. I didn't find anything. Other than an endangered Pterostylis foliata. Took a sample. It's a robust greenhood. It's really quite something, if you want to have a look. I'm doing what I can with your husband's blood but it's gonna take time - it's a process. I've gotta isolate the mutated proteins and try and engineer that into a serum. If the plants aren't growing at the death sites, then where are they growing? Well, yeah. That's the trillion-dollar question, isn't it? How could there just be one? That's so strange. Well, don't worry, love. The others sprouted up all over the place. We'll find one. Don't give up hope. Oh! Oh! Oh!
