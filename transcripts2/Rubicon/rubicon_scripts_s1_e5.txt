 Anything on those seven names?
 What are you doing here, ed?
 Helping you.
 What about the names?
 There's only one name that
concerns us... Donald Bloom.
 Does that mean anything to you?
 Who is he? He's ex-cia.
 Black ops.
 Anything else?
 Ed, are you all right?
 I'm fine... invigorated,
nose to the wind.
 Donald Bloom...
 he passed through Houston
six times in the last year.
 Why? I don't know.
 I do know that two days ago,
 he flew from Nigeria,
via brussels, to jfk.
 He's in New York?
 Possibly, or he could be
just about anywhere by now,
 including Houston.
 Check the white papers.
 You have access now.
 The white papers... anything
to do with Houston, Texas.
 Right.
 Connect the dots.
 Check the white papers.
 Sorry.
 Uh, good morning.
 Uh...
 You and the rest...
 of the team leaders
have been ordered...
 to attend Mrs. spangler's
annual charity event.
 This year she's supporting
"children's rights now."
 Maggie has all the information.
 Please donate $250 each.
 I can't afford $250.
 Sure you can.
 Sublingual herbs.
 I have the immune
system of a hydra.
 What's your read on Tanya?
 I haven't given her much thought.
 Am I missing something?
 She seems off.
 Off? How?
 A plethora of late nights
bleeding into morning.
 Right.
 Free-spirited type.
 Free spirits can get too
free with their spirits.
 Then you have security risk,
performance degradation...
 Never forget the stakes.
 I don't.
 She's your responsibility;
She is not your peer.
 Right.
 I'll talk to her.
 You missed a button.
 White papers.
 Go ahead. Make a left when
you walk through the door.
 hi.
 Uh, it's empty.
 That's impossible.
 Well, there's nothing in it.
 Everything gets scanned.
 Someone walked off with it?
 Well, I don't think it
walked off all by itself.
 Mcnaughton, please.
 Yuri Popovich isn't breaking
bread with George Boeck...
 because they're on the
same amateur soccer team.
 Well, we traded
Tanya's firstborn...
 to the BND for everything
they had on George,
 but since it's all in German,
 we won't have it till
the end of the day.
 So Yuri?
 It seems like Yuri
is branching out...
 from arms into drugs,
specifically afghani heroin.
 He's paying the uzbeks to keep
the wheels greased, and DEA...
 thinks he's taken over
an overland route.
 Well...
 ...It's all a logical move for
a Russian gangster, but...
 it still doesn't explain
what he's doing in Sofia...
 with George Boeck.
 Tanya?
 Any ideas?
 Who cares about Yuri?
 Um, we know exactly who
and what Yuri is.
 He's a criminal.
 His business is crime,
not terrorism...
 and George...
 We don't know what the hell is driving George,
 other than what Miles has dug up,
 which is: He's too rich...
 and too careful...
 to be playing footsie with a Russian gangster. Screw Yuri.
 We should put all
our focus on George.
 It's, um...
 All George, all the time, 100%.
 And if, while we're
focused on George,
 Yuri sells a nuclear bomb...
 to Osama Bin Laden?
 Are you prepared to live with that?
 Sure.
 Yes.
 Write it up.
 Your analysis, write it up...
 why we should go all George,
all the time.
 I just gave you my analysis.
 You gave me a speech,
 so if we're going to move to all George,
 I think you should go upstairs
and convince Spangler.
 You... you want me
to pitch Spangler?
 Will, don't you think we
should work this as a team?
 It's Tanya's idea.
Let her take the credit.
 Unless you were just blowing smoke...
 Sure. Happy to do it.
 You are very well diversified.
 Your investments in
real estate and energy...
 are especially strong.
 Stocks are down,
obviously, but rebounding.
 - Tom stayed away from the mortgage boom
- wise man.
 But I do think you should divest
yourself of MRQ Alternatives.
 Why?
 It's a bad investment,
a real money-loser.
 Tom wanted me to have it.
 As an asset.
 It's not an asset unless it's sold.
 Sell MRQ?
 Yes.
 Katherine, don't worry.
 This represents a minuscule
fraction of your total worth.
 Then I'll come to no
harm if I keep it.
 Anything else?
 No, that's it.
 Why did Tom leave me MRQ?
 uh, MRQ... I-I've
never heard of it.
 Tom had a lot of play in
over-the-counter stocks.
 Arnold says it's a bad investment.
 Why would Tom leave
me a bad investment...
 two days before he kills himself?
 I have no idea, but if Arnold
says it's a bad investment,
 it's a bad investment.
 Just get rid of it.
 Donald Bloom, please.
 Donald Bloom, please.
 Donald Bloom.
 B-l-l... B-l-o-o-m.
 You sure?
 How about Don Bloom?
 Hey, Will. Ed.
 Come on in.
 Might want to get out of the way.
 It's a large pepperoni
and mushroom.
 Uh-huh.
 He's here, all right.
 Who is? Bloom.
 He's in New York City.
 He's staying at the Waldorf.
 How the hell do you know that?
 I made some phone calls.
 Did you call every
hotel in the city?
 I got lucky.
 I started from "z."
 What's he look like?
 I've never seen him before.
 There's beer in the fridge.
 One thing I can tell you,
he's confident.
 He's staying under his own name.
 A little bit of hubris.
 A chink in the armor.
 The ancient greeks believed
hubris comes about...
 when men think they
can behave like gods.
 It's what we do.
 It's in our nature.
 And it destroys us.
 I found four white papers
relating to Houston...
 in the API library.
 One of 'em...
 was written by David.
 And somebody stole it.
 Stolen?
 Mm.
 This keeps circling back to API.
 Mm.
 What are you going to do next?
 Follow Bloom.
 See where he leads me.
 What do you want me to do?
 Wait.
 Teacher of mine used to say...
 our job was to find the dots,
then connect the dots,
 then understand the dots.
 We're still looking for the dots,
 and my sitting here
in this house...
 isn't gonna help us
find much of anything.
 The dots are out
there in the world,
 or in the bits and
pieces of information;
 the thousands of
signs and symbols...
 that we can pull out of raw data.
 A man waiting for a bus in Caracas.
 A woman buying vegetables
in an Algerian market.
 Teenagers fornicating
in a Liverpool basement.
 What's the connection?
 What's the narrative?
 Excuse me. Uh,
can you take a picture for us?
 Just right there.
Thank you. Come on.
 It's good to see you.
 Good to see you.
 So...
 Thanks for the gig.
 Glad to help.
 Your man is a little testy.
 My man's a little brilliant.
 Well, he's got us running
around the globe...
 stitching together this
very complicated...
 operation that's...
 You troll your side of the River,
 I'll troll mine.
 Got it.
 You look good.
 Nah, I'm fat.
 No, you're not.
 Yeah, I am.
 Plus, my back hurts,
and my knees crack every time...
 I stand up, and...
 My hair. I started losing
my hair a couple years ago.
 I was in Finland.
 I thought it was the water.
 It wasn't.
 You alone these days?
 Yeah. Yeah, I find
it simplifies things.
 You?
 Various delights.
 Lucky you.
 Yeah, I generally have
to pay for my pleasures.
 You know, I want to tell
you that... sometimes,
 uh... late at night,
 when... I'm alone,
feeling sorry for myself,
 I think of you...
 ...And those, well, the old days...
 in Beirut.
 I even have a
photograph somewhere...
 of you sitting on a balcony,
 sipping a cup of coffee.
 Great big grin on your face.
 We were killing people, Donny.
 Yeah.
 That was half the fun.
 What is it?
 This conversation
doesn't leave the room.
 Of course not.
 I, uh...
 I need you to tell me
everything you know...
 about Kale Ingram.
 Well, uh...
 What do you mean?
 I know he's former CIA,
 worked at API a long time.
 I think he's an ops guy,
 recruited by Spangler.
 What else?
 I don't know.
 Um...
 I think he's from Ohio.
 I know he has family there.
 What about David?
 Has he ever said
anything about David?
 What do you mean?
 Will, what's wrong? Hmm?
 Did something happen?
 No.
 I don't know.
 Will, tell me, please.
 I can't.
 It's complicated.
 Are you sure the David
hadas loose ends...
 have been neatly tied up?
 You know something I don't?
 I do not.
 Yes.
 Loose ends have
been nicely tied up.
 Thank you.
 You, um...
 Lined up the team leaders...
 for my wife's charity event...?
 Every last one of them.
 You're coming, too, aren't you?
 Oh, I wouldn't miss
it for the world.
 Miriam will be pleased.
 Forgive her.
 After all, she has
to put up with me.
 Yes.
 With organized crime,
except in a tangential way,
 to fill in an operational weakness.
 Except in the Balkans.
 Right.
 But that was part
of a large-scale...
 military conflict.
 Um...
 Well, uh, George Boeck,
 on the other hand,
 is the critical element
in the equation, and...
 the kind of financial linchpin...
 that U.S. intelligence has
traditionally ignored...
 in favor of operational players.
 He represents...
 You can't call the
guy a linchpin...
 on the basis of one photograph.
 Well, that's not the only...
 Linchpin equals hypothesis.
 You got bubkes for proof.
 Just don't call him a linchpin.
 George Boeck...
 is a well-educated,
westernized muslim...
 with the right profile
and resources...
 to play the kind of pivotal role...
 in a sophisticated... Speculation.
 Look, Tanya,
 I hate George,
but even I'm not convinced.
 Should I even bother to finish?
 Strip down your
argument to the basics.
 Build out from there.
 Go ahead.
 From the beginning.
 No.
 What?
 Whatever it is, no.
 How long have we known each other?
 Too long.
 It'll be five years this October.
 That's a substantial
friendship, Hal.
 My name's not Hal.
 Who introduced you to your wife?
 You didn't introduce us.
 You just happened to be standing
next to her in the cafeteria.
 I took you by the shoulders,
planted you in front of her,
 and said, "talk to her."
 Hmm? All right.
 What's up?
 I need an agency-wide
cross-reference search.
 The whole database?
 Whole database.
 Who or what?
 Donald Bloom.
 And Kale Ingram.
 Huh.
 What is it?
 It's some kind of CIA
case file number.
 And it's got the highest
security rating.
 Can you open it? The minute
I open it, they'll know.
 There'll be an automatic trace.
Do you want that?
 Thanks.
 Sorry.
 You looking for me?
 I was...
 No. Just coming up
to clear my head.
 I'll leave you to it.
 You let Grant and Miles...
 slaughter me.
 You think Spangler's
gonna be any easier?
 You're setting me up to fail.
 All right, if-if you don't think
you can handle this, let me...
 I didn't say that.
 No. I just...
 I think you're right.
 I think George is the
nexus of something big,
 and-and, and-and focusing on
him is gonna get us somewhere.
 Would it have killed you
to say that in the room?
 There's two types of fear.
 There's the type that
makes us work harder,
 that-that drives us; We dig deeper.
 There's the kind that makes my
heart come up in my throat...
 and it makes me...
at the cost of my own sanity...
 look for answers,
 because, damn me to hell,
I-I can't let up in this one.
 That's good fear.
 The bad fear...
 is the kind that makes
us stop working.
 Paralyzes us.
 Makes us stay in bed
all day and hide.
 Bad fear doesn't make
you a bad person.
 It just means you
shouldn't be working here.
 Ed?
 Hey, Ed?
 Be right there.
 What is all this?
 Dots connected, my friend.
 Dots connected.
 The synopsis of the synopsis.
 Donald Bloom worked for the CIA.
 The CIA launched an
operation in June of 1983...
 to assassinate hezbollah
leaders and financiers.
 This was in retaliation for
Hezbollah's suicide bombing...
 of the marine barracks in Beirut,
one week earlier.
 The go-code to begin the operation
was a crossword puzzle...
 published in various
international newspapers...
 and written by me.
 Bloom traveled from Nigeria
to JFK a mere three days ago.
 Bloom has recently spent an
inordinate amount of time...
 in Houston, so,
 among other things,
we can now place Bloom...
 in the Middle East and in
Houston and in Nigeria.
 What do they all have in common?
 Oil.
 If the 1983 code...
 was for assassinations,
and Bloom was an assassin,
 then we can deduce...
 that, very soon,
Bloom is going assassinate...
 someone in either Nigeria...
 or Houston, who has
something to do with oil.
 Oh, by the way,
is it a coincidence...
 that Bloom flew into JFK?
 Ed, maybe we should
just call it a night.
 Ah, no, no, no, I'm not finished.
 The crossword puzzles you found
have to contain go-codes...
 ordering one or more...
 assassinations.
That just stands to reason...
 Ed...
 Which brings us back to Nigeria,
 Beirut, Houston and the CIA.
 JFK was assassinated in Dallas,
 of course, but still, that's Texas,
 another oil-rich region,
and even though...
 Beirut has no oil,
 it sits in the middle
of an oil-rich region,
 and is, in fact,
the banking capital...
 of the aforementioned
oil-rich region.
 Ed, we got the wrong Donald Bloom.
 What?
 It's not him.
 He's not the guy in the picture.
 I checked it out.
 He's an 18-year-old,
an engineering student from Oregon.
 There's no oil in Oregon.
 No, there isn't.
 So here's what we're going to do.
 We are going to stand down,
 because we have both
gone way overboard.
 And it ends right here.
 Tonight.
 You hear me?
 You understand me?
 Ed?
 David was my best friend.
 I know.
 best friend...
 ...In the world.
 Oh.
 I'm sorry. Please.
 Thank you. Vodka on the rocks.
 Can you make that two?
Yes.
 Thank you. Whew.
 Social lubricant.
 How do I justify the
ones I drink alone?
 Oh, I call those oxygen.
 Oh. I'll remember that.
 Katherine Rhumor.
 Will Travers.
 Will.
 Remember the Maine, James.
 We have no choice.
 If we don't do it, who... who will?
 Will.
 Will... Come in, come in.
 I'd like you to meet two of
my oldest and dearest friends.
 James Wheeler, R.C. Gilbert, Hmm?
 Hi, Will. Will.
 Hi. Will is
one of the sharpest...
 tools in my toolbox.
 Don't know what I'd do without him.
 You enjoying the party?
 Very much. Thank you.
 Mm.
 Liar.
 If you see my wife,
 tell her I love her, Hmm?
 It was nice meeting you.
 Sorry I'm late for
the shindig, truxton.
 As long as you leave a donation.
 With my love for Miriam.
 The squalls have been shipped.
 They'll be on-site in a week.
 God bless you and your
Harvard doctorate.
 Give the man a drink.
 Music, merriment...
 what more could one ask for?
 Donald Bloom is an
old friend of mine.
 Donald Bloom?
You saw us having lunch.
 Oh, right.
 Sorry, I di...
I didn't mean to intrude.
 You didn't.
 You scurried away.
 I don't know why, I...
 I was embarrassed for some reason.
 You just happened to
be in that restaurant.
 I like the prawns.
 I strongly suggest you stick
to the analysis side of things.
 I would hate to see you
involved in any mayhem.
 George Boeck is a rich man
with an impeccable reputation.
 It is implausible to believe
that he has become involved...
 with a known organized
crime figure...
 simply for financial gain.
 This suggests his motivation
is either ideological...
 or emotional.
 Either one ought to concern us.
 This man is educated,
well-traveled,
 and sympathetic to the cause, uh,
 exactly the kind of
semi-westernized muslim...
 mm-mm-mm! Who has proven...
 ...Proven most, um...
 Lethal in the past.
 He has the means...
 and he has the connections.
 Simply put, he is exactly
the sort of figure...
 Al Qaeda ought to recruit.
 This leaves only two possibilities:
 Either we have identified
him before they have...
 or we're already one step behind.
 Done.
 Sir?
 Drop Yuri, go all-out for George.
 What's the next step?
 His son's wedding in three days.
 We need full audio and
video surveillance.
 I'll call NSA.
 Kale, you take point...
 and get them the,
the, the... Sigint.
 ...Sigint they need, Hmm?
 Thank you.
 Alright.
 Alright.
 What have you got?
 We are going to stand down...
 because we have both
gone way overboard,
 and it ends right here.
 Tonight.
 When was this?
 Last night.
 Concentrate on Katherine Rhumor.
 Kyle, pick up line four.
 It's about the button.
 Good afternoon. Hello.
 Uh, I'm Katherine Rhumor.
 Who's in charge here?
 Uh, I am.
 Uh...
 Mrs. Rhumor.
 Hi.
 Hi. What can I do for you?
 Uh, can I have a word with
you in my husband's office?
 Of course.
 Uh, this way. Appreciate it.
 What's your name?
 Harold Almyer.
 This it?
 Well, yeah, he, uh,
he didn't come here much.
 I only saw him once or twice.
 Joey, your wife is on the phone.
 Joey, please pick up.
 Your wife is on the phone...
line one.
 Uh, what exactly does
MRQ Alternatives do?
 We make clothes...
we used to make clothes...
 not very successfully, I'm afraid.
 I, uh, I think I'd
like to be alone.
 Of course. I'll be right outside.
 Please pick up on line two.
 Harold?
 Do you have the
combination for this lock?
 Um, I'm sorry, that's Mr.
Rhumor's private files.
 I don't know the combination.
 You got it. How'd you know?
 Anniversary.
 Thank you, Harold.
 Enter.
 You ever wonder what
life was like...
 before electricity?
 Just us and the elements.
 So much darkness.
 So many shadows.
 Dispelled with the
flick of a switch.
 Tanya did well.
 She's a good analyst.
 This just arrived from MI-5.
 One of their surveillance
outfits in Amman.
 The fellow there with
George is Ashtad Madari,
 the main money man for
Iranian intelligence.
 He supplies Hezbollah...
 and other terrorist
groups with the means...
 for their nastiness.
 Seems like your girl was
way ahead of the curve.
 Mm-hmm.
 I'm gonna have to put
her name on the list...
 for the next round of drug tests.
 As you see fit.
 You find out what
George is up to, will,
 before it's too late.
 Good night.
