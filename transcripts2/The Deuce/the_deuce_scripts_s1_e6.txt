 That movie you had me make
with that John?
 I don't think nobody paid us
except for that John.
 I'ma look into it.
 Make sure we ain't
get took advantage of.
 There's been a change.
 Something about
community standards.
 What about community standards?
 Apparently, New York has none.
 Hey.
 - In the van, sweet pea.
- Whoa!
 - Hey!
- On what charge?
 Soliciting.
 You know, I've been reading
about the testimony
 that went over to the
Knapp Commission.
 Is it true?
 The pad?
 I wouldn't know.
 Put your name on nothin'.
Whether we fund for this,
 I want no one made,
no one who's family.
 Don't get left holding that bag.
 What the fuck do I know about
a massage parlor?
 I don't-
So, you'll learn!
 Hey, Rochelle.
 All right.
 Fucking smokes.
 Hard at work.
 How about I speak
for both of us, okay?
 - Nobody got fucking on
the brain. - Uh-uh.
 - Shit.
- Vincent, what's the word?
 Girls look like they're freezing out there.
 Neither snow
nor rain nor heat
 nor gloom of night
stays them courtesans.
 Yo, Vince,
who the cop?
 My brother-in-law,
Bobby.
 For real?
 I smell bacon.
 Enough with
the cop shit.
 All right, look, guys,
I need some girls.
 All right?
Three if you can swing it.
 Starting tonight.
Three more by tomorrow.
 What, you some kind
of Superman?
 Nah, come on. Look, I got the
place all set up, ready to go.
 I need day
and night shifts.
 Vincent, what the fuck
you talking about?
 - The parlor.
- The parlor?
 I mean, Frankie talked
to you, right?
 He said something
about something.
 Thought the joker
was joking.
 No, it's real.
 Hand my girls to you?
 You're not a pimp, barman.
 - Stick to the stick, you'll live longer.
- Preach!
 Look at them
standing out there.
 I'm offering you no more
standing out in the cold and snow,
 coughing and sneezing.
 Yeah, how about you, Lurch?
You get cold?
 Or you one of them undead
motherfuckers that don't feel it?
 Say one more thing.
 Look, all right,
all right, look.
 How about no more getting
ripped off by scumbags?
 Some john steps out of
line, he catches a beating.
 We handle everything.
 Best of all:
no more busts.
 - We're protected.
- So, you think you can mack, Vince?
 No, I'm hardly
gonna be there.
 Yeah? So, who's gonna be
looking after the candy store?
 I am.
 - Shit.
- Oh, man.
 - For real?
- Now I'm curious.
 What you gonna give us
for our women?
 Give you?
 No, you're gonna pay me.
 All right,
let me explain.
 Man, get the fuck
outta here.
 Now.
 It's 414 W. 42,
just down the street.
 Just come check it out.
 - That's all.
- Motherfucker.
 - That's bullshit.
- Walk the walk, ladies.
 That went well.
 Patience,
brother, patience.
 Sisters
 Brothers
and the whiteys
 Blacks
and the crackers
 Police
and their backers
 They're all
political actors
 But they don't know
 There can be no show
 And if there's
hell below
 We're all gonna go,
go, go, go, go, go
 Everybody praying
 And everybody saying
 But when come time
to do
 Everybody's laying
 Just talking about don't worry,
worry, worry, worry, worry, worry
 They say, "Don't worry, worry,
worry, worry, worry, worry"
 They say,
"Don't worry, worry
 Worry, worry, worry,
worry"
 They say,
"Don't worry, worry
 Worry, worry,
worry, worry."
 We're shooting in five, all right?
 - You look good.
- Thanks.
 - Feel good? Yeah?
- Yeah.
 So, what's the plan
for this one?
 The plan is...
 you bang the shit out of each
other, and then everybody comes.
 - Jeez, Harvey.
- Wing it with the dialogue.
 Nothing avant-garde,
please.
 And, you know,
just keep talking dirty
 about how much
you want his dick.
 Harvey, hey, let me
ask you something.
 So, you make your prints,
 you'll get paid by, what, number
of sales, percentage of profits?
 Are you actually telling me
we don't get any of that?
 Yeah, well,
it's complicated.
 Try me.
 What do you want, Candy?
 You want
fucking royalties?
 You want residuals?
What?
 Here you go.
 All right, I'll tell you what,
I'll throw you another $50.
 All right?
That's a pretty fair bump.
 - Anyway, you're welcome.
- Thank you.
 Yeah, hold on.
 At least you're
in the movies now.
 You're not selling ass
out there in the trenches.
 You're an entertainer,
Miss Merrell.
 All right.
Adriana, you ready?
 All right, don't look
so enthused.
 - Before we get
to the readouts
 and the random bullshit
that are piled before me,
 I have some actual news.
 Uh-oh.
 As we are approaching
the end of the year,
 it is time for our
semiannual housecleaning,
 where we restore the 14th
Precinct to a previous glory
 the likes of which none of
us have ever actually known.
 Street sweeps.
 This year, however,
the bosses in their wisdom
 have asked that we pay
particular attention
 to the high-heeled army
 that marches along
8th and 9th Avenues,
 as well as their
managerial component.
 Fuck the fuckin' whores
already.
 No, no, no, no.
 No, Patrolman Flanagan.
 The whores of Times Square
will be decidedly unfucked
 from now
until the holidays.
 So much so
that your commanders
 do not want to see
a single pross
 standing
on any street corner
 in the precinct.
 Everybody goes
in the wagon.
 Every corner,
every tour.
 And the pimps
- throw any charge you can at them.
 You don't have charges,
 you can write up their over-chromed
wonders and tow them off.
 We're gonna spend
the next two weeks
 making the 14th uninhabitable
to the pussy trade.
 Two weeks?
 Hey, these are the orders
from on high.
 I'm making a career
out of this.
 As of today
and until New Year's,
 actual paid overtime
will flow
 for court time
on all prostitution arrests.
 - Hell, yes!
Why didn't you say so?
 Okay?
 Behold, gentlemen,
your holiday bonus.
 - All right, let's get
to the felonies.
 Hey, I'm Candy.
 - Peter. How you doing, Candy?
- Good. You?
 All right, what are we waiting for?
 Let's turn
the lights back on.
 I went down on a guy once
 after eating
a really spicy...
 Miss McGillicutty,
you taste like pussy.
 I do?
 Like delicious pussy?
 Fuck, I can see I'm gonna
be looping dialogue later.
 - Yeah, enough.
Enough of that.
 Um, yeah,
just start fucking.
 Oh.
 No, get the
- yeah, yeah.
 More thrust.
I want to see shaft.
 - Frame up.
- You got a good frame?
 Yeah. Yeah, Harvey.
 Okay, Candy, I'm gonna ask you to come now.
 Now?
 - For Christ's sake, we're framed up.
- Okay.
 The makeup still looks right,
okay? We're gonna get this now.
 Oh, I'm coming!
 Oh, don't stop!
Don't-oh.
 God!
 Oh.
 Great.
 Okay, let's get back
between her legs.
 Fuck.
 - Honey. You didn't.
- Cut.
 - Are you fucking kidding me?
- I'm sorry, Harvey, I got carried away.
 Don't worry,
I'm good for it.
 - It's okay.
- Oh, honey.
 - Josie, poppers.
- On it.
 They give me migraines.
 You want, I can
puff that up for you.
 No, don't you move.
 I'll have to reset
if you do.
 Hey.
 You can't pay me enough.
 Give me five minutes.
 I'll give you three
minutes, all right? Hurry up.
 Mankiewicz never had to
wait around for a hard-on.
 Five minutes.
 Jocelyn, can you
hand me a towel?
 - Yeah, sure. There you go.
- Thanks.
 Sooze, how you doing,
beautiful?
 I'm good, Mr. Pipilo.
Drink?
 Maybe a little later,
thanks.
 Shuffle
me up another run, Mike.
 All right, man.
 - Just who I needed to see.
- Really?
 And I came here
looking for you.
 Oh, well,
you go first.
 I need a couple of your
guys for this evening.
 - Gotta run around on something.
- My guys?
 Faces that won't be recognized.
 Our people
are all too familiar.
 No, man, aces low.
 All right, how about
Mike and Black Frankie?
 Whoa, whoa.
 What about White Frankie?
 I got this, Mr. P.
 Whatever you need,
I got.
 All right,
you're hired.
 Big Mike
and White Frankie.
 Why are you
looking for us?
 Vince, I gotta get some
real gin from the back, okay?
 All right.
 I like that.
 Listen, Rudy,
Bobby and me,
 we tried to pull up
some of the pimps
 to get girls for the place, you know?
 Let me guess-
no sale, right?
 All right, we'll help you
stock the pond to start.
 Try Sal's cousin.
 You know, the greasy little
fuck out by the airport.
 - Yeah.
- You should go with him.
 Learn something
about closing a deal.
 Okay, let's have
a couple drinks,
 and then we're gonna go out
and have an adventure.
 Explain to me
exactly why
 there's now film
in the camera.
 - Change in the weather.
- Meaning what?
 The obscenity laws.
 - They pass new ones?
- No.
 No, not really.
 It's just
these judges downtown,
 they're tossing
everything now.
 Every last fucking case
is getting tossed.
 Why?
 It's-I don't know.
 You know, it's been,
like, a loop here,
 a skin mag there,
you show a little,
 you see if they lock you up,
see if they convict.
 If they don't,
you show a little more.
 It's been going on
like that for years now,
 one pubic hair
at a time.
 What changed?
 I don't know exactly.
 These last couple cases,
 the judges aren't
trying to decide
 whether or not
something is too dirty,
 only whether it has any, you
know, what do you call it?
 "Socially redeeming value."
 And does it?
 Not that I can tell.
 Okay.
 So, what time tomorrow?
 You know what?
Make it Friday.
 Let's say 10:00.
 - Tomorrow I gotta go to court.
- Okay.
 Yeah, you were, uh-
you were very good today.
 You know, I mean, professional
about it, very pro.
 "Pro."
Yeah, well.
 Where's Dino?
 Four girls
for an eight-hour shift.
 Rudy Pipilo will
consider it a favor.
 Hey, first of all,
I don't live
 in Rudy Pipilo's ass
like some people.
 Two girls, $400 per.
 Three girls, $300 per,
and I pick the girls.
 That's not smart, 'cause you
don't know which ones have syph.
 Some of these girls are soaking in
vats of penicillin between tricks.
 - You wanna pick them?
- Got a point.
 Also, they get door-to-door
transpo, on you.
 What's wrong
with the subway?
 Come on.
 After eight hours
of fucking,
 you take the A Train
back to Queens.
 We got a deal?
 Half up front.
 Pay this guy.
 Let's get the fuck
outta here.
 All right.
 Those gorillas?
They work for Marty Hodas.
 What are they, leg breakers?
 No.
Sweepers.
 They empty
the loop machines
 and bring the coin
back to Marty's office
 for the count.
 Then Marty sends me my cut
 for letting him
put his machines in stores
 where I got friends.
 How many stores?
 Eight right now
where I got the accounts.
 The Horse?
He's got many more.
 - Matty the Horse?
- Yeah.
 I got a feeling that by
the time my cut gets to me,
 the count is a lot
lighter than it should be.
 Why would Hodas
short you?
 It's in his nature.
 - Like the scorpion.
- What?
 In the story, "The Scorpion and the Frog"?
 - What story?
- It's a fable.
 I gotcha.
 Yeah, well...
here's what I need.
 You two get a cab and you
follow these two mooks around
 store to store while
they make their pickups.
 And then when they start getting
near where Hodas has his place,
 over on 42nd,
 you call me
at this number.
 Don't be late
calling me neither.
 All right.
 You think you
and Wilt the Stilt here
 can handle playing spy
for a few hours?
 Sure, no problem.
 Just, uh... why now?
 I mean,
what I mean is, like,
 you must've been suspicious
of Hodas for a long time.
 Why now?
 Because there's gonna be
real money in it now.
 Right here,
made in the U.S.A.,
 not some
other country shit.
 Imagine watching a movie with
American girls, speaking American,
 getting reamed
in every hole
 and swallowing cock without
any hassle from the law.
 Now is when I gotta get
straight with Marty Hodas
 and whoever else
is in on the skim,
 because the payoff
is gonna start to grow.
 So, now... get the fuck out of my car.
 Red light! Red light.
 Really? Oh, that's nice.
 - Hey, taxi. Taxi!
- Yeah, come on, man.
 - Ladies.
- Rooms are back there.
 You take number three.
 You got two, and you,
pretty lady, got four.
 Who the fuck rates
number one?
 Drywall isn't
finished in one.
 Go ahead, walk around,
get the feel of things.
 You need anything,
ask Frankie here.
 He'll set you right,
okay?
 - It's so fucked up.
- Mm, mm, mm.
 Running whores with my
sister's fucking husband.
 Hey, hey.
 Break it down
right here.
 You guys need
some help, or...?
 No, we're just looking.
 Mike.
 Come on, let's go get
a drink. What the fuck?
 Hey! Three-quarter walls
like a fucking stable?
 - What am I, a horse?
- Girl, it's for your own protection.
 This way, we can hear you
if you get in trouble.
 Shit, motherfucker,
if I'm in trouble,
 you can put up Fort Knox, you'll
still hear me loud and clear.
 Coño, you got 250-watt
bulbs in that lamp.
 I'm supposed to fuck someone
in there or bake them?
 Where the fuck
is the Jergens?
 All right, ladies,
ladies, come on.
 Management,
we're on your side.
 Whatever you need, whatever you
have to have to get the job done,
 we're gonna provide, okay?
 - Same team.
- "Same team."
 - So, you my teammate?
- Absolutely.
 How much dick you gonna
suck tonight, pretty boy?
 Mm-hmm.
- Pendejo.
 All right, fuck.
 I like the Rican bitch.
 Reminds me of my second
wife before I went to Nam.
 Come back to the world,
 she was crazier
than a shithouse rat.
 In 30, I'm gonna turn the lights
on out front, see what comes.
 I am fucking gone.
 Yeah, sure. You want a double?
 - Okay.
- Thanks. See you, Abby.
 - What's that?
- Tequila, the good stuff.
 Mm.
 What the hell
happened to Vincent?
 You damn near worked the
whole shift without him.
 Yeah, I don't know. He said
he had problems tonight.
 - "Problems."
- Mm-hmm. It's cool.
 He's covered for me when I've
blown a shift before, right?
 Oh, hey, um,
I meant to ask.
 What did you get arrested
for? I never heard.
 Mm.
 I never said.
 Hey, I didn't mean to-
 Shit, I don't care.
 Misdemeanor faggotry.
 Being homosexual
north of 14th Street.
 Every day, it's something, you know?
 Mm.
 But what
was the charge?
 Soliciting.
 Who did you solicit?
 No one, really.
No one.
 But I was coming out
of a theater
 where the boys go to play,
so I guess it evens out
 if you're keeping score.
 I'm not.
 Well, someone is.
 Fuck them, right?
 The one thing I know,
 the one thing
I'm certain of...
 it's just sex.
 If you stand back
 and think about what we all
look like chasing each other,
 you'd have
to laugh, right?
 Ah. If it wasn't
so much fun,
 it'd be ridiculous.
 Exactly.
 Yeah.
 Hey. Sorry I
didn't make it back in time.
 I feel like I have to wash this
whole fucking city off of me.
 Need help?
 - Sure.
- I gotcha.
 - Anyway.
- Asshole!
 Papi!
 There's another skim, right there.
 All right, Mike, why
don't you go hail us a cab?
 Me? We'll be here
all night.
 Yeah, all right.
I'll get the cab.
 You keep your eye
on these animals.
 Yeah.
 Look, if it's broke,
it's broke.
 Call my guy. He'll come
down and fix it tomorrow.
 What the hell can I do about it this late?
 - Can I help you?
- Yeah.
 No, thanks, we're good.
 Excuse me, you can't go in there.
 All right, how many
machines supposed to be over there?
 Wait, from 46th to 47th,
five machines.
 How you doing, Marty?
 What the fuck?
 What the hell
you doing here?
 I'm with the Horse,
remember?
 Sure, sure. I see you're on the count.
 Is there
a problem here, Rudy?
 I don't think so.
 - Because I'm not-
- Here, I tell you what.
 Today only, my guys here
 are gonna help you
with the count.
 They're gonna lug
these coins outta here,
 they're gonna figure
them all up,
 and they're gonna lug them
over to your bank tomorrow.
 You two, put these coins
in the trunk.
 Use the rollers.
Save your backs.
 We're gonna need
a couple of these, too.
 All right.
 Fuck. We could've counted
it right here. What the hell?
 My favor to you, Marty.
Take the night off.
 Just bring
a deposit slip tomorrow.
 Baby, I need your lovin'...
 Penny for your thoughts?
 They're not worth it.
 That bad, huh?
 - I think so, yeah.
- Got to have all your lovin'
 - Some say it's a sign
of weakness...
 - For a man to beg...
- So, do you like this music?
 - Thank God,
I'd rather be
 It's... I don't know.
 What do you listen to?
 Me?
 You.
 Come on,
what do you listen to?
 Got to have
all your loving
 Baby, I need...
 The fact
that you are married
 Only proves
you're my best friend...
 Mm.
Lou's tender side.
 But it's truly,
truly a sin...
 Who knew?
 I saw the Velvets
playing live
 at Max's in all
their black glory.
 Shh.
 - I'm listening.
- Linger on
 Your pale blue eyes.
 Hey, look, it's the Horse.
This should be fun.
 I hear what
you're saying to me, Marty,
 but you don't have to keep
explaining it to me.
 You gotta get some sense
into these punks one way or another.
 They don't wanna listen,
then maybe you guys
 - gotta lean on them
a little bit.
 The fuck you doing, Rudy? You got
no business doing what you did.
 You mean what?
The coins?
 - Yeah, the coins.
- I got an interest.
 He's got machines
in the stores that are mine.
 - Uh-huh. - A piece
of that accrues to me.
 He's getting his take.
 Yeah, a percentage
of whatever.
 What? You're saying
I'm stealing now?
 - Are you?
- No.
 Listen, right now we're
looking at the raw take
 so all of us know what
an honest day brings in.
 This way, none of us can
say we were misled, right?
 Did you run this little
move of yours by your guy?
 - I mean, does he know?
- What do you think?
 I think you got
a couple stores.
 I own a couple
of dozen.
 I also have the product.
I own the labs.
 The majority of the film
operation, that's Genovese.
 And that's me,
not you.
 You got a problem with what I'm
doing, Matty, take it up with my boss.
 You tell him that no one has
any reason to doubt the count.
 I should go fuck myself.
 See how that plays
at the club.
 - So?
- Fucking...
 Good news today, yeah?
 I think so, Rudy.
 Always ready
for good news.
 Precedent no longer guides us.
 For good reason, too.
 This term "pornography"
defies definition.
 Even those judges who agree
that a particular film
 is not legally
pornographic
 cannot, among themselves,
know why.
 And the result
is a hodgepodge.
 And we of the lower courts
are constrained to anticipate
 final action of the
majority of the higher court.
 So we flounder
in wondering
 what the Supreme Court
will do in each matter.
 - Who's at bat there?
- What, them guys?
 They're the ones
who got busted
 when they kicked the door in
on Matty's film lab.
 The one out in Queens?
 They're the ones
who got caught
 with all that film footage
last year, remember?
 Mm.
 Attuning the law to the times
is the primary function of the courts.
 May we never forget that.
 Now, what I think
of these films
 as an individual
is immaterial.
 As a judge,
I cannot stultify myself
 to satisfy my personal
feelings and inclinations.
 And the evidence here
is indisputable
 and bind me to granting
the defendant's motion
 and dismissing
the indictment.
 These personal freedoms
are protected
 by the 1st
and the 14th Amendments.
 The defendants
are discharged
 and this case is closed.
 - Didn't I tell you?
- Yeah. Yeah.
 All right,
back to work.
 Just this case, or...?
 It's been like this with damn near
every obscenity case on the docket.
 In this town,
nothing's dirty anymore.
 - And the movie thing I was
telling you about?
 The backers backed out
of that one.
 It was a long shot,
anyway, but...
 I'm thinking of it
as a bump in the road.
 There are gonna be
other movies.
 I have not
given up on it yet.
 So, in the meantime,
you're gonna end up back on-
 Ma. Look at me.
 I am not going
back to that, ever.
 And, Ma, there will be
other movies.
 This time next year, I will have put
aside enough to get a place for us
 and hire a babysitter.
 Hire a babysitter?
 Yeah, you've done
enough, Ma.
 I'll tell you
when I've done enough.
 If it hadn't been for Adam, I never
would've involved you in any of this.
 It wasn't right
to make you live with it.
 Shit!
 He wasn't due back home
till tonight.
 Yeah, you didn't know?
 I didn't. But would it
kill you to say hello?
 - It's been years
since you two-- Enough!
 After everything
that's happened,
 you go on
like it was nothing?
 You are incredible!
 Have you been to visit
my brother lately?
 I go out to see him
once a month.
 And what about you?
 How long has it been
since you've seen Patrick?
 Who the hell is
yelling? I heard yelling.
 It's nothing.
 All right,
that's about five grand.
 So, what's the deal?
 $5,000.
 At least, that's what
made it to Hodas.
 On a good week,
he's pulling in 40 Gs.
 Me and Mike saw the pickup
guys do a skim at the van
 and at least one
of the bookstore clerks, too.
 - Figures.
- Forget about the skim.
 What's Hodas been showing
every day?
 $3,500.
 - Sometimes less.
- Damn fucking Jew bastard.
 Well, now we know, right?
 Let's go see our friend Hodas at the bank.
 Girls, welcome back.
 Two, three, four.
 Rochelle here's already
claimed number one
 where the wall is fixed.
 So, you're number one, huh?
 Oh, it's cool.
It's non-hierarchical.
 Are you sure
you're all good, babe?
 What do you want
for dinner?
 Chinese.
Place on 9th.
 - The dish with the peanuts.
- Kung pao.
 Chinese it is.
 Get an order from the rest of
the girls, will you, Frankie?
 Gotcha.
 Okay, so,
I'm opening up now,
 and you need
to finish that drink.
 No pimps in the joint
when we're open.
 - House rule.
- Can somebody turn on the damn heat?
 These ain't raindrops
in my eye
 Just look at me now
 I've been crying
because I love you
 I wonder why
can't you see me
 Just one kiss
would do so much
 It would drive away
all my fear
 These ain't raindrops
in my eyes, oh
 They are tears
 Oh, now, oh
 Oh, right now
 These ain't raindrops
in my eyes, baby
 That I wipe away, now
 If you tell me
you love me
 Everything
will be okay
 If I thought
that you'll ever love me
 I would wait
 I would wait
a million years
 These ain't raindrops
in my eyes
 No, they are tears
 Oh, oh
 Ain't no crying
'cause I've been to heaven
 So how can
there be rain?
 Yeah
 The man up there
 He knows
just how I feel.
 Y'all done gone crazy
with this shit.
 It's not really in the
holiday spirit, is it?
 Damn sure ain't.
 Well, Merry Christmas.
 Yeah, you, too.
 Travis, where my money at?
 Okay, so when
can you make it?
 Okay.
 All right, okay, Karen,
I'll let him know.
 It's gonna be an hour before
she can get here, maybe two.
 - Where is she?
- I don't know.
 She said it was
a life emergency.
 What the fuck is that?
 You want me
to call that Angela?
 Angela's a blonde.
 We need a brunette
for contrast.
 Give me some cab money.
Excuse me.
 I'll be right back.
 Thank you.
 Every shift,
even daytime,
 they ran the wagon out
at least twice.
 I saw them tow every car off
that pimp stretch along 38th,
 and all of those cars
were parked legally.
 It's end of year.
We're housecleaning.
 You do this
every year?
 Sometimes twice.
 And then it's back
to business as usual.
 Do you like jazz?
 - I thought we might go and
see-- So, what's the point
 of doing all this if you're just
gonna go back to more of the same?
 No point.
 Who ordered it?
 We could just go uptown,
have some dinner.
 Sylvia's?
 I mean,
everybody loves Sylvia's.
 You know I can't
date a source, right?
 I'm a source?
 Well, what
do you call this?
 I don't want
to be a source.
 Okay, officially,
you're not a source.
 Are you happy now?
 Nope, not yet.
 Let me ask you.
You ever seen it like this?
 With the wagons
running day and night?
 And the harassment?
 I heard some guys
from your precinct
 drove a bunch of pimps
over to Jersey
 and dumped them
in a cow pasture.
 Were you in on it?
 That wasn't me.
 But, yeah.
 This is the most I've
seen us do all at once.
 And I don't get it
either.
 I mean,
other than the Deuce,
 where do they think
all the dirt is gonna go?
 Every time. Every time.
 Don't make songs
like that anymore.
 I'm telling you,
this is fucked up.
 That's fucked up music.
 Fuck does "wimoweh"
even mean?
 Oh, wimoweh,
oh, wimoweh
 Oh, wimoweh,
oh, wimoweh, oh, wimoweh
 - Oh, wimoweh...
- Where did you learn how to draw?
 Oh, wimoweh,
oh, wimoweh, oh, wimoweh
 Oh, wimoweh,
oh, wimoweh, oh, wim...
 You want some pie?
 On me.
 - Mm.
- Pretend we're on the same team.
 Banana cream.
 Leon?
 Honey, can we get
two slices of banana cream?
 - You can and you're gonna.
- Shay, baby.
 Hey, you wanna make
a quick $100?
 Hey, Land O'Lakes girl,
you wanna make a quick $100?
 Well, hey, no.
I'm up before her.
 No, no, baby,
we need a brunette.
 - $100 for what?
- A one-day wonder.
 A real movie?
 Yeah, come on.
 Order up!
 - Pie.
- Yeah.
 - Gotcha.
- Come on, come on.
 Cancel one slice, Leon.
 - You got it.
- Let's go.
 Sweet.
 For you, baby girl...
 that's on Leon.
 You mutts brought
me down here for this?
 - Absolutely.
- The fuck am I looking at?
 All right, you know how the
raincoat-wearing degenerates
 have to cut the pockets
out of their pants
 before they go
into the peep show?
 Not no more.
 See, the average man
 could use some privacy when
he's looking at those blues.
 Yeah, I came up
with the title.
 We're gonna call it
a "Masturbatorium."
 - Trademark that shit.
- See, you make partitions,
 like they do
at the fancy hotels
 for the toilets and all.
 - See, the average man-
- I get it.
 - I get it.
- Eh?
 You know, so they can
jerk off in there.
 This is really like a dream
come true for me, you know?
 - That's great.
- I'll do her makeup.
 All right, we're
gonna start on the stethoscope
 and then pan over
to the bed.
 - Measure it out.
- It's so easy.
 Just don't look
at the camera.
 Don't look at the guy
giving directions.
 Pretend like you like it
way more than you ever would.
 Mm. Yeah, been there.
 You on the pill? 'Cause
the guys don't use condoms.
 - Oh, yeah, every day.
- You ready for makeup?
 Yes.
 - Am I ready?
- Yeah.
 - All set.
- Thanks.
 I feel ready.
 - Let me see your frame.
- Oh.
 - The camera's the john.
- I can't get ready...
 Fuck the camera.
 Right.
 I can't see her bush
from all the way down there.
 - May I help you?
- C.C.
 Whoa, whoa,
who the fuck is this?
 - I was looking for you.
- Yeah, so I heard, high and low.
 - So, uh, what? You're the mack now?
- Hey, guy.
 Put your pants on, motherfucker,
before you catch a cold.
 Hey, I don't want
no trouble, all right?
 I'm on the up-and-up
with your girl, here.
 Oh.
 Didn't know.
 A hundred?
 You can turn a hundred
in the room in an hour.
 You've been gone
damn near two.
 I have?
 You got another one of
them C-notes, Mr. Up-and-Up.
 - We had an arrangement.
- Sure, but we didn't.
 - To keep the peace.
- Mm. And $40 from him.
 - Me?
- What?
 Yeah, you fuck my girl,
you pay.
 $40's good
for half-and-half.
 C.C., baby, you pay for the
fuck or the hour, not both.
 Oh, what, you're my fucking
business manager now?
 Just stay out of my shit.
 - Get dressed.
- Please, we're ready to shoot here.
 Time is money, fat boy, or
did you not learn that yet?
 - Yeah, and I'm tapped out!
- Oh?
 - Please.
- "Please."
 There ain't no please
about it.
 - Let's go!
- Jesus.
 No, wait.
Jos.
 - Seriously?
- Yes. You, too.
 You're paying
me back on this, Harvey.
 Paid in full.
 Oh, uh... you may now roll
the motherfucking camera.
 You're in a good
fucking mood tonight.
 I pulled a date
for tomorrow.
 Yeah? You better wash
your asshole tonight.
 Most guys don't like it
when you're dirty down there.
 Wonderful night.
 Just lovely.
 So, I suppose by now you're all
familiar with the new fee schedule
 and parking restrictions
out here.
 And it's only
gonna stay this way.
 Not just through
the holidays,
 but all the way
into February.
 I mean, I'm just
letting you know.
 - February? For real?
- At least.
 Every corner between the Deuce
and 4-9 has been indicted.
 If I was you,
gentlemen,
 I would take
strong consideration
 for any offer
that moves your ladies
 off the pavement.
 That offer
is a good offer.
 - Goddamn Sweeney.
- Pigs!
 The fuck was that about?
 I don't know.
 Thanks for the lift.
 That girl you brought
in today was too nervous.
 Ah, she'll get better.
 So, when's the next shoot?
 Next? Three weeks,
a month.
 - What?
- What? I mean, these things take time.
 We gotta edit, print,
send it to distro...
 - I can help with that.
- ...I gotta wait to get paid.
 - Eileen, I-- Harvey, I've
been making these fuck films
 with you for a while now.
 I must be up for
some kind of a promotion.
 My margins is tight.
 I can't afford to put you
on a regular payroll.
 A month till the next shoot? Really?
 - Patience is a virtue.
- Fuck virtue.
 What am I supposed to do
for money till then?
 What you did before.
 No.
 I'm sorry, honey, I-
if I could do something
 for you, I would.
 Eileen?
 Motherfuckers
have lost all perspective
 on this shit.
 Police?
 Police, lawyers.
 I mean,
bail money for my women
 is now double
what it was a month ago.
 Cold out there, bro.
 Hard for a mack
to make his nut.
 Mm. I hear you.
 So, this pussy palace
you got.
 - You check it out?
- I stopped by.
 Had a look in.
 Talk to me
about the terms.
 All right.
 You pay me
$400 a night rent, flat.
 In exchange, the girls
get a safe environment
 for as many hours
as they can handle.
 Once in the room,
 the girls
negotiate the price
 and they keep 100%
of what they make.
 The more girls you give me,
the better it is for you.
 Shit, you give me
three, four girls,
 you can make,
I don't know,
 $1,000, $1,500
a night profit.
 We handle it all.
 You do nothing
but rake it in.
 That the deal you worked out with them hoes
 out from the airport?
 That was a onetime deal
to get us on our feet.
 I wanna be there,
 make sure
everything "copastetic."
 No pimps.
 It's nothing personal.
 It's coming
from a higher power.
 Rudy the wop?
 Mm-hmm.
 Be that as it may.
 I'll give you Melissa and Shay
 on a one-week
trial period.
 See how it go.
 Rodney?
 Tiffany.
 And Ginger.
 What about you?
 I'm thinking on it.
 I feel like shit.
Can I come in?
 Want some?
 Not with my gut, no.
 Club soda, if you have.
 - Yeah.
- Thank you.
 This is nice.
 Two years here.
You're my first visitor.
 Honored.
 Thank you.
 So, why'd you
come up here?
 - Not that.
- So?
 - What?
- I hate the way you feel now.
 I'll get over it.
Thanks.
 You know, I looked
the word prostitute up
 in the dictionary
one time.
 It says "a person
who has sex for money."
 I am not a fucking fool.
 I know I'm not
an actress.
 I came to you
because I wanna learn
 to do what you do.
 I- I-
 I don't have
enough work yet.
 You know, but the way
things are changing,
 maybe I will soon,
I don't know.
 But I like you, Eileen.
 Listen to me.
 Give me an hour to set
this up after I leave.
 And I want you to ring this
number and ask for Alex.
 I don't need
a fucking pimp, Harvey.
 - That's not what this is.
- I don't want a pimp.
 Listen to me!
 The clients are vetted,
they're clean, they're safe.
 And you can say no
to any call.
 What's the catch?
 Well, it's sex.
And she takes a cut.
 - She?
- Yeah, she.
 It's-
 it's all I can think of
right now, but, um...
 who knows where
we go from here, right?
 Whoa, Officer.
 Uh, ahem, this is
a membership club.
 - So unless-
- Relax.
 Sweeney from the 14th.
 So, you're up
and running.
 Not bad.
 Not bad at all.
 I just stopped by to let you know
 we put out word
in the precinct
 that the best place
for the girls is indoors,
 so you can expect your pick
of the litter any time now.
 And somebody will be by
every Wednesday for our taste.
 Which, from the looks
of things,
 $500 a week.
 Uh, Lieutenant?
 I'm just
a bartender here,
 but it's my understanding
from the owners
 that arrangements
were made downtown.
 Well, that's downtown.
 This is for the 14th only.
 $500.
 You'll never,
never, never know me
 Oh, hey
 If you don't know...
 You know,
there's another one
 around the corner
on Dyer.
 And a third just opened up
near that one.
 All in the no-go zone.
 No-go means go.
 - What's that?
- What does it look like?
 For me?
 Free money?
 No such thing.
 Not in this lifetime.
 That there
is your back pay.
 For what?
 You know that loop
you got ripped off on?
 That should
never happen.
 I tracked that dude down, shook
him for two bills and an apology.
 He said that
will never happen again.
 Again to who?
 You.
 Looks like
he's kicking back up
 and he wants you.
 I told him I'd ask,
 but the decision
was yours.
 I thought you looked fine
on that thing.
 - Yeah.
- Hmm.
 The johns see that.
 Some of the others at
the stroke joint? Hmm?
 Next thing you know,
you start to get
 the following out there.
 You double your price.
 Maybe charge
for an autograph
 'cause you famous now.
 I don't know, Larry.
 All those people
watching you,
 the cameraman telling me turn
my ass this way, that way.
 - I hated it.
- Yeah, yeah, it takes some getting used to.
 The other thing-
movies are forever.
 Once they got
pictures of you,
 50 years on, they're still
gonna be there.
 - So?
- What if I have kids?
 What if my kids
have little kids?
 I hear you.
I hear you, girl.
 You tapping Loretta
for this stuff, too?
 Loretta's busy, all right?
 She got a regular
paying her top dollar.
 Just know...
 with everything that's
going on out there right now,
 cops banging us up?
 It's about
to be the movies
 or the ho-house.
 I'm not your source.
 If you say so.
 I say so.
 I've got a hell
of a story for you.
 Eddie!
 Shit, he's an asshole.
 Hey.
 You sure
you want to do this?
 Your brother and the big moolie?
 They did good, Vincent.
Real fucking good for me.
 You let them know when they
come in the bar tomorrow
 there's gonna be
something there
 in the register
for them both.
 Truth is,
I think the big moolie
 is the brains
of this operation.
 - No offense.
- No.
 Look, Rudy, I gotta
ask you a question.
 I'm not in a crew.
 I'm not connected
to anybody.
 Where are
your people from?
 Italy. The boot.
 I don't know, I'm from Bay
Ridge. What the fuck do I know?
 Look, my question is
why me?
 I mean, why did I get tapped by Rudy Pipilo
 to handle all this here?
 What did we just learn
about the loop money?
 What do we know,
Vincent?
 I'm swimming
in a shark tank.
 Marty Hodas, his muscle,
the bookstore guys,
 even Matty the Horse.
 He's Genovese,
and they're supposed
 to have honor, right?
 I bet you
dollars to donuts
 that Matty is skimming
with Hodas, too.
 These are my allies,
supposedly.
 And all of them are
a bunch of fucking thieves.
 Except you.
 How do you know?
 'Cause you've proven it
time and time again.
 "Why me?"
 And I keep trying
to tell you, I trust you.
 Compared with everyone else
I'm dealing with,
 you're a goddamn
parish priest.
 And that means
something to me.
 Tell your goofy brother
what I said.
 - Are we good?
- Yes, that's lovely.
 - Thank you, darling.
- Okay.
 Just sit down.
 Oh, I see. Okay, you're ready, aren't you?
 All right, mm, yes.
 Yeah. Ooh.
 Oh.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Daddy... Vinny.
 Did you hire her
to sleep with her?
 What?
 Why I gotta clock
and she don't?
 She doin' the movies.
 Now you're just droppin' the girls off
in one of the parlors and killin' time.
 We become extraneous
in this situation.
 That guy's the new C.O.
 Captain McDonagh wants
a tour of the precinct.
 Why am I givin' you this tour?
 You are probably on the outside
enough to be trusted.
 I want the truth.
