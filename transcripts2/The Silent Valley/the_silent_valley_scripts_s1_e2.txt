 According to the lab results, the gun was a Beretta M9. - So he used Cristian Iuga's gun? - He might have. There's more. How should we proceed with Cristodor Ceprache? Honestly, I doubt he’ll talk unless we give him a good scare. No offense... I just know these people. They only talk to cops if they’re... - ...in the hot chair. - Yap. - If you cite him, we'll get him in. - No. I’ll go talk to them. - Where will you go? - The Romani community. Then... how do we do this? Give me the victims’ addresses, please. I can’t fuckin’ sleep. I toss and turn all night. When I do manage to sleep I get nightmares. Do you dream about him? Not only that.

 I dream about them finding the gun too and... - I think about him all the time. - At least you get to sleep! Look, it's no secret you go training there at night, right? Yeah, so? I don’t know... - If you told them... - Don't start again! But who says you weren’t there on your own? You can leave me out of it completely! - We’d be done with this already! - Dude, I said no! If we start talking, this thing will never end. We lost our best informant there, in Silent Valley. You had an undercover agent there? A CI. Cristian Iuga. And we have no leads. Plus, that woman, she's being a nuisance. - What woman's that? - The prosecutor, Elena Zamfir. She’s running the investigation. But now that you’re here, you’ll bring her to heel, I'd imagine? Keep her from hijacking our Jartea case, I mean. So how's the inquiry going? Do they have any leads? Any clues? No, the killer didn't leave much, just the four vics and a charred car. - What about the murder weapon? - Still missing. ♪ The Holy Word ♪ ♪ The Holy Word shall be for ever.. ♪ ♪ The skies and the earth ♪ ♪ will perish, says the Word... ♪ ♪ Only one thing will stand ♪ ♪ against time and last for ever ♪ ♪ It was gifted us, ♪ ♪ Blood-spattered from Calvary ♪ ♪ It is like no other, ♪ ♪ One of a kind under the sun. ♪ ♪ The Holy Word, the Holy Word, ♪ ♪ The Holy Word is great, so great ♪ ♪ The Holy Word, the Holy Word, ♪ ♪ The Holy Word shall be for ever ♪ Please God, let Your Holy Spirit work through us!

We ask, in the name of our beloved Jesus Christ, who died for them... ...welcome these souls in Heaven, beside You! Have pity on Romeo, Stadian, and Geani... - ...our brothers, and my sons. - Amen! Blessed be, Lord! Did you hear that? Someone's coming! They're in the woods! - Come on, man, let's run, hurry! - Chill, man! See?! This thing you're going through, it's not OK, Horia. - You need help. - I just need help getting to sleep! Didn't you score your mom some pills that time when she was crashing? Yeah, when she started popping them like candy, so the doc cut her off. You can find anything on the street, but pricey as hell. Dad takes sleeping pills, so I snatched some from him. But his stash ran out, or he hid them or whatever. Beats me! Fine... What sleeping pills? There's an... A and an X in the name... I can’t remember. - Anaxolan? - That's it! Anaxolan! Are you crazy?! That stuff's really dangerous, they’re addictive! If I stay up another night, I’m gonna lose it! Help me, please. Please! Good day! Cristodor Ceprache? Elena Zamfir. Prosecutor. My condolences for your loss. And who might you be? He’s my youngest. Aleodor. Can you tell me when you last saw your sons? That evening. Did you know they were working for Nicu Jartea? It was their choice, ma'am. Did they fall out with anyone? Any enemies? Any debt? They didn’t tell me any of that stuff. Do you know where they were going that night? Madam. I don’t want any more trouble. Our lives are in God's hands. Whoever killed them will get their just deserts on Judgment Day. I understand. But as long as the killer's at large, innocent people, even kids... ...like Aleodor here... ...are in danger. Whose car was that, Aleodor? Sorry, ma’am, but we’re in a hurry. Good bye! Hey! Did you bring it? Hand them over, go on! Dude, what’s wrong? You look stressed as hell! If I go another night without sleep, I’ll kill myself, got it? Come on, give it here, I have to go! OK, but this is all they had. What's this, man, are you hitting on me? You want to get me high and then do what you did at the cabin, right? Where are you going, man?! Take it! At least this won't get you hooked! Who do you take me for, that junkie mother of yours? Say it! You think I'm like her, huh? CAN YOU GET IT FOR DOUBLE THE MONEY? - Is something wrong? - Horia saw everything. What did Horia see? He was in the forest when it happened. I’m listening! He said he wasn't in the woods on the night of the murder. That's not true. He was by the cabin, he went in the shed, to park his bike. Hold on, what did Horia see? He saw a car coming into the woods. He heard a gun go off, three or four times. And then he saw a man fall. Was it three or four? Try to remember, it's important! - Easy, Elena! - Four. I think it was four. He said four. Then he saw the killer head for the shed... Horia bolted through the woods... The killer went after him... He hid behind a tree and then hit the guy in the head with a rock. Then he took his gun and ran. And why didn't Horia say anything? He’s scared. Of that psycho. And Radu. - And why didn't you say something? - I promised Horia I wouldn't. But now he’s going crazy. He can't sleep at night... And where's the gun? Hidden, in the woods. I know where. He showed me. - Are you sure this is the spot? - Positive! There's nothing here. Shit! It's not true. - Nothing of what Filip said is true? - Nothing. Just that I was up there a bunch. Training, that sort of thing. Why do you think Filip would make this up? No clue! He'll spin out his tales sometimes, he's in his own head... I don't know where he gets that from, might be the stuff with his mom... Speaking of, how is Filip's mom? YOU SUCK! Horia's denied everything. The gun isn't there. Filip's lying. What's worse, he actually believes his fabrications! Yeah but... why would he make up such a thing? To get me back for the thing with my sister? To get you back?! Come on, Filip's a good lad, let's not forget that. What if it's his way of getting your attention? - So, his lying is my fault? - No! I’m saying, maybe he feels neglected. You've hardly had any time off lately anyway... Or he knows that whatever he does, you’ll defend him! That's only because you’re always too tough on him! But whatever the reason, it's a warning sign. And I think we need help. Filip, what do you think about being here? They must be thinking I've lost it. What about you, do you agree? - Can I skip this question? - Yes. How do you feel about those murders that happened so close to your home? Next. You told Elena and Silviu some things about your friend, Horia. Can you tell me what that was about? Next. - Horia, wait! We need to talk! - You did enough talking for us both! Let me explain! I said you were in the woods 'cause you're not doing OK. - It's why I didn't get you the pills. - Fuck you! I got them. Horia, please, just wait! Let me... - You're coming to the party, right? - What party? At my house, on Saturday. - I might, sure. - Come by, yeah? Just you. No ruffian wingmen. What the fuck are you gaping at, dude? Must be some sort of delusion, right? That’s just one possible explanation. Was it all in his head or is he consciously lying to us? That's hard for me to tell definitively after just one meeting. - Please, could we talk openly? - Of course. Best case scenario, he's just testing you... ...to see to what extent you can handle his shenanigans... ...and if he can rely on your home. Best case scenario? So, you don't think this is what it's about? I have other theories, if you want. Based on what Filip went through and accounting for the complex feelings he’s trying to cope with. We can speculate. But it’s too early for me to issue any conclusions. He's yet to express any of his feelings or thoughts outwardly. Which, frankly, is understandable, considering the mistrust that you've just shown him. And that it wasn't his choice to come see me. We can’t pretend we believe him. He told us a lie! Not necessarily, as far as he’s concerned. But what if he’s manipulating us? You asked me to talk to the boy, not investigate him. - Thank you! We’ll be in touch. - Of course. - Robert Dima! - Elena Zamfir! Nice to meet you. It's impressive! How’s the investigation going? Quite well, from what I see here. No shortage of persons of interest. More faces than clues, unfortunately. Nothing relevant that might explain how... ...Cristi Iuga came to meet such a tragic end? No, nothing. I’m sure it’s just a matter of time. It’s early days still. - Shall we? - Of course. The car’s been set on fire. Clearly, to hide all possible traces. The cabin hasn't been touched. It suggests there was no one there that night. Did the lab results come in? They sent over everything. Well, just about. And? Nothing promising? Nothing helpful for making headway. Have the DIICOT provided enough intelligence support? I see. The age-old institutional war. Add to that the fact that the DIICOT aren't known for their etiquette... ...and I'll conclude your answer is no. I'll say it in their defense though. Their methods aren't uncalled for. Considering the type of people they're usually dealing with. Always working in the shadows, under pressure, in a closed-off world. If by 'closed-off' you mean self-reliant, tinged with corruption. I know the DIICOT quite well, this isn’t my first rodeo with them! Cristi Iuga's reports on the Jartea clan. These span 3 years of undercover work. I'd prefer it if you came to me for whatever info you need. Be assured, I will always treat you with collegial respect. And trust. - I'll be in touch. - Alright. I only told them to help you, can you really not see that? I thought you were losing it! Not sleeping does that! Pill-popping addiction is not a joke! Get the fuck out of my face! Do you really think everyone's a faggot like you?! All I know for sure is I love you. Even if you were a girl, I’d love you. Are you nuts?! Your mum should’ve got you dolls with dicks and slits! - You’d know the difference! - It was your way? You’re a fucking aberration, you fucking turd! Even legal businesses are staffed with under-the-table workers here. Yeah, shopkeepers, hair-stylists, waiters, day workers... The underground economy is costing the state 22 billion a year in losses. While the criminal networks are whooping it up. And we twiddle our thumbs. - So what do you propose? - To crush them. So a cake walk then. We just annihilate them! Nothing to it. We bust in on them. Go for the money-laundering, rackets, their gangs and their rings, all of it! And these ops would solve...? We'll have these scumbags living in hell and paranoia! Yeah. We've deployed slightly different methods so far. I know. And they've failed. We got a dead CI out of it. We have to strike. Swift and efficient. There's no other way. You do get we can’t wait another three years to place another mole. That's what I was brought in for. Madam DA can have her murders. It's her job after all. - And about what you told her earlier? - What's that? The hell with her! You've reached Child Protective Services. Please, leave a message. I'm Filip Zamfir. I'm calling for Mrs. Ionescu. It's urgent. - Is something wrong? - Child Protective Services called. They want a meeting, as soon as possible. OK... Filip doesn’t want to live with us anymore. I set it up with the social worker, two hours from now, at our place. I hope you can make it. Good day. The funeral home sent you, did they? I told them I didn’t have any money for'em! 'Cause Jartea said he’d cover the funeral. But I don’t need his money. When they heard I've got nothing, they said they'd call the cops on me. I don't have it, lady, I just don't! I'm not from the funeral home. I'm DA Elena Zamfir. - Oh my Lord! They're suing me! - No, madam. I'm investigating the Silent Valley murders. I’ve come to ask you some questions about Romeo. But first I just want to say I'm so sorry for your loss. Your only child, you raised him more or less on your own... Do you happen to know where he was headed that night? I don't. He doesn't tell me where he goes. I don't know. You know, you can file a request with City Hall, for financial aid... It covers most of the funeral costs. I did go, to file that, madam, but... ...they said it was wrong and didn't tell me how to get it right. I can help. I’ll send someone from City Hall to show you how to fill in the forms. Good bye. Madam? My Romeo kept saying how he didn't wanna work for Jartea no more. And you think Jartea found out and did it as payback? Don't know about that. But I reckon, if he'd been the one who killed them... ...he'd have hidden them so deep they'd never turn up again. Anything else? That's all I know. All right. Thank you. [IN ROMANI] What's up? Get in! The boss wants a word. Move it, squirt! Go, go, go! Go, lads, go! - Hello! I'm sorry I'm late. - Good day! So they think I'm crazy. - That's not true! - Let’s let Filip finish. What are your thoughts on this? My husband must have told you how we came to this confusion. Partially. But I'd like to hear your version as well. I’m so disappointed that he... ...that you'd have this notion, Filip. What you just said is... Then why didn’t you believe me when I said the gun was there? What gun's that, Filip? Something about one of my inquiries, it's got nothing to do with this. The problem is he's always defying us. I thought it was a phase, but lately... In any case, we’ll get through this together, OK? As a family. No. - This will never be my family. - But we are! How can you say that? She didn't even consider mom a part of this family! That’s why she sent her to jail! Get it? She put away her own sister! - You know it’s not the whole story. - It is! It is! Now she just took me in because it looks good for her. That's it! I’m just a fucking project to them! Nothing more! I’m just something broken that they need to fix! That's not true! - Yes it is! - No it's not! If that's what you think of us, I've got nothing more to say. What if they end up taking him away, did you think about that? I don’t understand what did I do wrong! Wrong?! You have to spend time with him and build a relationship! And not act like you did him a favor by taking him in! And not look away when he talks about his mom! Not to cop out when the going gets tough. That way Filip can understand, and feel like he's got a family! - Why must I stay with them?! - At least until the next report. I don't get it... Did they bribe you or what?! I’m sorry, Filip, I know it’s not easy for you, but trust me! These conflicts are normal in the first two years. - Mainly when teenagers are involved. - You're saying it's my fault? What I mean is kids your age have different needs. A smart kid with a big personality like you feels sort of misunderstood. Other times you feel alone, like you don't fit in. I know what that's like. It's all part of growing up. There's no avoiding it. And no matter where you're placed, you'll be facing the same issues. These people are your family. And these family bonds stick, no matter how hard we fight them. Anyway, judges always favor relatives in adoption cases. Filip, let's give it some time! Let's wait and see if you can't manage to overcome this together. - [IN ROMANI] Hey kid, welcome! - Good day. [IN ROMANI] I’m deeply sorry about your brothers, you know. - How's your dad? - Dad's doing OK. Is there anything I can do to help? Anything you need, kid, you let me know, you hear? Got it? Good. Let's go inside, it's cooler. Worried you'll track mud in, Aleodor? You can do it, go on! - You do a lot of walking, huh? - Yes. How would you like to drive a scooter? Can you imagine? You'd be beating chicks off with a stick. Well then maybe you can tell me what you know about what went down. About what they were up to that night. I don't know anything. They kept their business to themselves. What business is that, huh? - Weren't they unemployed? - Yes, they were. OK, then, tell me about this business! I don't know, Mr. Nicu! They never told me and dad nothin'! You prick! I'll find out anyway, so if you don't want me to fuck you up and your bible-thumping daddy, you'd better 'fess up now! - I really don’t know, Mr. Nicu... - Then who does, huh? They talked about a deal they’d made to take a shipment. It's all I know! [IN ROMANI] I bring them in on the scheme, put food on the table, ...and they steal from me!? - Who did they deal with? - I don't know! You don't?! - They're dead! Why does it matter?! - What did the DA want? She only spoke to dad! Tell me what you said or I bury you! Nothing, promise, I didn't say nothin'! - We didn't do anything! - On the ground! I'll kill you! You and your dad! Everybody down! Face down! Hands behind your head! You're dead! Get the fuck off! Face down! Hands behind your head! What do you think you're doing, huh? What's this business about? Is there a warrant to go with this fuss you're making? Hey! Where are you going? Hey lad, what's with this warrant, huh? What's your probable cause? - I'll make a complaint! - Please do. Bingo! You might want to add to it that people are doing coke in your house! Coke? In my house?! Give me a break! It's a frame-up job as the day's long! Don't you think I can see that?! We found him in the basement. Do you know him? Or is this a frame-up job as well? Some thugs thrashed him and he came to complain. I don't know how to tell his dad. He is old, got a bad ticker, poor thing. So you put him in the basement because wounds faster in the dark. Did he have you beaten up? Be brave, you're safe now. The kid speaks the truth! I have my faults, but I don't hit kids! Thanks for dinner. You're welcome. Where to? Just out. With Horia? This can't go on. You know what? What if we had the Diaconus over for a barbecue? We’ll ask them to bring Horia along. They’re probably cross with us too. This way, we can smooth things over. What do you think? That’s it! A barbecue! Why didn’t I think of that? Do you have a better idea? Go on! You do realize Horia's Filip's only friend, right? And I bet tempers got frayed after that gun thing. I tell you, this operation hurt the entire Roma community Their searches were based on just clues they made up It's textbook, abuse of power! Do you think the raids are related to the Silent Valley inquiry? Maybe. But, either way, they've this in common: Mrs. Zamfir is forgoing procedure left and right. She's conducting informal interrogations... She's using some shady tactics to win the witnesses' trust... Sure, it could all be just a rumor. But you know what they say: where there’s smoke, there’s fire! Can you tell me why you hijacked my case with a raid... ...that no one bothered to tell me about? And that sicced all those jackals on me? I know, I read that. We're not all that bothered, we're used to it. I'm sorry you ended up in that journalist’s cross hairs. If you'd given me a heads-up you'd have nothing to be sorry about now. It was a generalized determent raid. We didn't target only Jartea's clan. We ransacked the whole city. You realize this might've destroyed my chances of finding the killer! The whole Romani community will be under Jartea’s eye! Getting anyone to talk now will take a lot of effort! It's the only language they understand! They should be kept on the boil, made frenzied! Really?! Have you ever thought about those whose lives Jartea's hurting? They might give us a hand, if only we won their trust! I didn't mean the Romani people... ...but the gangsters! ALL the gangsters. Let me explain. We decided internally to put pressure on the clans in the city. To show them we're watching. Jartea is just one of many. It didn't even think that it could impact your investigation. But I promise, from now on, we’ll tell you. From now on? I already had a very good lead, which I meant to follow differently. Oh, really? Why didn't you tell me you had such a good lead?! We would've postponed the raid. As to what the papers write, I wouldn't worry. The Romani don't read dailies. Mrs. Zamfir, I reckon we all stand to benefit from working together. Or we risk standing in each other’s way quite often. So? Can we try improving our communication and working together? We both want the same thing after all, right? I'll start. We found Ceprache's youngest in Jartea's cellar. He was beaten. It's not serious, but he's at the county hospital. If that's of interest to you... Everything is of interest to me. ROOM 1 - Hello, Aleodor. - Hello, ma'am. Jartea beat you up, isn’t it? I know they found you in his basement. It would help me to know what he wanted from you. If he did this, he’s not going to stop at anything. He’s dangerous and you’re not safe. Help me stop him! I understand why you won’t talk to me. So I’m not about to pressure you. If you do change your mind or if anything happens to you, call me. Good day. - Your mother can't come down today. - Why not? I made the appointment. - I'm sorry. Try again next week. - But what happened? We can't give out any more information. Please! I need to talk to her! It's about something very important! Sorry, try coming back next week. Not like that! Look, this is how you do it! Thanks for the show-and-tell, Radu! I guess I could use some practice, huh? How about a top-up? Hard liquor would hit the spot. - Whiskey. 12 years old. Want some? - Yeah! What about your meds? You know mixing the two is a bad idea. How about some wine, Filip? Thanks, but... I need something from the house. All done! - There you go. Enjoy! - Thanks. Come on, the stake’s done. Let's go, Filip! ...marches to a slower beat. - Slower? Like the joke! - Don't be cross now! - You've got the gun. - Yeah. Thanks! Excuse me... I have to push off. So soon? There's a party at a classmate's I have to get to. At their age, it’s a miracle when they sit down with us for a meal! Could you let us know when you’ll be back please? I’m not going. Wouldn't you rather go with Horia than spend the night with us, though? I wasn't invited. I know you wanna get rid of me, but don't make me be a tagalong! Enjoy your meal. He doesn’t believe it himself, you can be sure about that. This kid should show some gratitude, don’t you agree?! Excuse me. - Good bye! - Bye! Hello, Barbu. I can. Go ahead. ...is not available... It went to voice mail... Maybe he went to that party after all. - So he'd be with Horia. - I'll call him. The person you... No, it's shut off. Grab the keys, let's go! - I can't, I've been drinking. - Let's go! Have you seen Filip? He wasn't around, no. - What about Horia? - He just left. Let's go! There he is! Horia, where's Filip? I don't know. - Didn't he go with you to the party? - No. I'm not Filip! So don't play games! Where is he? I really don't know. 0-17 to Barbu. The Railway police reports seeing someone... ...on the rails, in Triaj, near Oneves. Roger 0-17. I'm on my way. Filip! Filip? Filip, can you hear me? Filip? Filip! Are you in any pain? Filip?! No, I just wanna stay here a while longer. Just that. I think he's just three sheets to the wind! Let's go! Easy does it... There you go! All done! The person you are trying to call... The person you are trying to call... Jesus! I wouldn't have pegged Filip as someone capable of that! Sorry about last night. Hope you're not upset. Oh no, of course not... Don’t worry about that... Give Silviu our love. And Filip too, of course. - Will do. - Bye. - Where did they find him? - Near the train tracks, in Triage. - What was he doing there? - They wanna know, too. It looks like he tried to... Fixing a kid his age is next to impossible! Fixing?! We’re not talking about a car here, Radu! Horia!
