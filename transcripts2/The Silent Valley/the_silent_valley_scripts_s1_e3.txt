 After it was done, I saw him look around... ...then I saw him heading right at me. Towards the cabin? No, the shed. It's where I keep my bike. That’s where I was. I panicked and ran off into the woods. - So I take it you saw his face? - No. - Was he tall? - No. - Bulky? - Athletic. Did you happen to see what color hair he had? No. I hid behind a tree. And then... I grabbed a rock, got behind him and hit him in the head. - Did you look at him after he fell? - I was too scared to look at him. I tore off but then I remembered the gun, he still had it.

 I doubled back, yanked it off him and ran. Could you recognize him? No idea... it was pitch dark too. I wasn't thinking... I thought I might've killed him! You did very well, Horia. I’ll need to have a chat with your folks too. I'd like you to stay over at our house tonight. OK? - Can you give him a ride, Barbu? - Of course. Let's go! - What would I do with a gun?! - Nothing, don’t take it personally. I just want to see his version dovetails. Where is Horia? Not at the precinct I hope! No, Horia isn't a suspect. He's at our place. - Why's that? - It's safer this way, seeing as... He’s a witness whether we like it or not. And if the killer knows it... - I'm going to get him. - Please! It's better for him to stay with us now. I hope to get him a protective detail by tomorrow. And meanwhile we’re supposed to, what? Just sit around and wait? How’s Filip? He was right all along, wasn't he? Yes. I have to go. Idiot! Is it true, you want to move out? Looks like it. Listen... What you saw... Mia and I... That didn’t mean anything. That’s not what this is... What, then? I don’t get why the fuck you have to go! I just feel it's better this way. All there is to it. So you won't come see me at the championships? Do you want me there? - Yes. - Then I'll be there. Only if you quit it with those pills. I'm done. Stopped taking them. You know... I feel bad. How bad? It's Elena. - Are the boys OK? - They're in his room. They have a lot to clarify. We must have that talk with Filip. Now it’s vital to protect Horia! Let’s not forget, Horia has his parents, while Filip... You're right. But we must solve this case so things get back to normal. The case... It's all you talk about these days! What does our talk have to do with it?! A lot! Remember, Filip was willing to lie just to protect his best friend. How do you think he’d react if something happened to Horia? These things are very close to to us now. They’re connected, can’t you see that? Horia! We have to go! I hope he didn’t forget his manners, that one. He’ll sometimes lay into people who come 'round so they know their place. He just likes to play tough though, he's actually a real softy. This one time... ...he had to shake some guy down, collect his debt for me... [IN ROMANI] And this big oaf comes back with his tail between his legs. I saw he was shitting bricks, so I asked him - [IN ROMANI] 'Did you sort it?' Nothing. Not even a peep from him, zilch! 'Speak up! Did the guy neuter you 'and you don't want me hearing your new soprano voice?' Myeah. And then he says, in this grave tone - 'Thing is, boss, his kid was there.' Sick kid... some sort of birth defect... The putz went soft on the guy. You know what I realized then? Besides that this guy’s a limp dick the size of China… I realized that, in this shitty world, kids are all we have of value. [IN ROMANI] Kids are all we've got! They are our God. The rest of it? Faith? Love? And the other one, whatchamacallit... What was that thing, from your Bible? - Hope, boss. - Exactly right! You bet your ass it's hope! [IN ROMANI] It's all turned to shit! Shit! For us, at least. You, well... you're more persistent. [IN ROMANI] What happened to them? Who's that? [IN ROMANI] My boys! How should I know? I never understood traitors. What's this? Acting like you don't know, are you? They wanted to fuck me over! Their way of saying thanks for the home and the food I gave them! [IN ROMANI] If was you, you killed them! Listen, I understand, I know you're upset. I wouldn’t want to be you right now, burying your kids tomorrow... So I won't take offense for all of this. [IN ROMANI] If you lay a finger on Aleodor again, you'll get your own back! Listen here, you! Your shit-for-brains sons got what was coming to them, to be clear! I wish I knew who killed them, I’m sorry they did, 'cause I would’ve wanted to off them myself! [IN ROMANI] And I'll off the runt myself if he tattles to the cops! If you lay one finger on him, you’ll have me to deal with! - Good day! - Good day. - He's my cousin. - You can't go in. I just came to see him, check on him, I won't be long, can I pop in? All right. Just for a minute, or I'll get in trouble. [IN ROMANI] What's up, kid? How goes it? All good? Here! It's from your uncle. For being a real trooper! It's the latest model. It takes photos online, records clips online, it's got it all online! It’ll do whatever you damn well please! Boy, it'll even strip for you! I have to go, cuz. I’ll see you back home. They say you can’t come with me. You have to have an escort. [IN ROMANI] Uncle says to keep it up. You know, with the pigs. Yes, boss, I can talk. I'm at home. What's this, Nicu, you're talking to the press now?! Do you think I invited the cops in? If you didn't invite them, they still knew enough to come! Sure, they're watching my every move! And who's god damned fault is that?! Boss, let’s take a beat here, this isn't getting us anywhere. I’ll say it again, I think we need to delay this shipment. - I’ll sort it all out, I swear it! - I'll tell you what to sort out! You’ll make sure the stuff reaches its destination this time! We’re not delaying anything! OK. No delays. Will everything be as usual? All good with the border cops? Yeah. We’re all fucking hanging on you coming through! Careful, don't fuck this up for me or else...! Hello? Hello?! Still nothing? Please go over them again. Maybe something will turn up. - So he couldn't ID anyone? - No. We need more photos. And more Intel on suspects in organized crime cases. Unfortunately that’s the only database we can access. - I have to go. Stay here with Horia. - All right. Got it. It turns out you’re not the only ones who like raids! We’ll soon be given new resources. Let’s not forget that the raids are only means. Our target, Jartea, is now feeling the pressure. I’d say this moment right here is one of a kind. You know, like the lyrics: when he knows we know and we know he knows we know. His problem is he has to make a move. Sorry, it's my mom. Hello, Elena. OK. I'll wait for you in my office. I want to know every move he makes. All the lead-up to the next shipment. - Are we clear? - Yes, boss! Great! Is that something for school? For History. Listen, Filip... I just wanted to tell you that I’m... That Elena and I, we’re both sorry we didn’t believe you. - And we want you to stay with us. - Why? So Elena can play cop on her days off as well? I get it, you’re mad at us, but you’re way off the mark about that. I need access to a database with organized crime suspects. For? Has something happened? You do realize this database you need is classified. If you want me to get you clearance, I need to know what you want it for. I found the murder weapon. The murder weapon? - Where? - Someone brought it to us. An eye witness, to be exact. An eye witness? So? Can you help me with that database? Of course. Of course. I'll be happy to. I take it this witness will be able to identify the killer? I hope he will. OK. It's great news. Has the witness been placed under protection? Not yet. I can help with that. What do you need? Two agents. Keeping a close eye on the witness, from a distance though. It’s crucial that their life go on as usual. I can assign one of my teams to it. They'll be at your disposal in an hour. Sounds good. But I'll need the best. Of course. - And they will report to me alone. - Absolutely. As for the suspects database... You’ll get access instructions, you’ll be able to log in temporarily. Someone will be in touch when you get to the office. OK. Thank you. So I’ll expect the two agents at the DA’s office. - Brought him in for questioning? - Yeah. And have you already interrogated him? Yes, but we couldn’t get him to talk. Wait here. Can I go home now? Sure. But before you go I was hoping we could talk. As I said back at the hospital, I want to help you. And I know you can help me as well. He beat you up because you know something, right? Did he threaten you? Aleodor, we have to catch these guys! Remember, your brothers are dead because of them. And they aren’t leaving you alone either! Why did Nicu Jartea beat you up, what did you say to him? Everything you tell me stays between us, I promise. My brothers made a deal with someone. About some payload... Jartea wasn’t in on it. - Whom did they make the deal with? - I don't know. Didn’t you ever hear them talking about him? Try to remember... anything you can. They called him “German” on the phone, and said he used to live abroad. Is he Romani? No. - Can I go home? - Sure you can. You're a good kid, you did the right thing. The transport won't be pushed back, got it? Same route, no changes on that front, are we clear? There will be changes though, in that we’ll go secure the goods. Grafian and Soare, go to the entry point in Giurgiu and follow the truck up to Cheia. Leave tomorrow, after the funeral, to be there when it enters the country. - Got it, lads? - Yes, boss. That's all. Go on! [IN ROMANI] Good luck! - Hi, Camelia! - Hello. Come in, sit down. I’ll get straight to it. Laur tells me you’re one of our best operatives. And that you’re eager to get back to work, right? Good. I think I have something for you. It’s something strictly confidential. OK. It’s a protective detail for an eye witness, in Elena Zamfir’s case. I told you, it was dark in the woods, I couldn't see him. I know, but you might remember more as you go through the photos. - OK. - Just try, Horia. Any detail can turn out to be important. You can stay for as long as you need, take your time. If you recognize anyone or if someone gives you the minimum pause, write down the number of the photo, OK? OK. The agents from the DIICOT are here. - Hello. - Hello. I stress my rule about complete confidentiality. That includes the DIICOT or any other institutions. You report only to me, don’t disclose anything at all to anyone. - Good bye. - Good bye. Agent Badoi! Robert has vouched for you. He said your familiarity with the case would be an asset after all. Still, I suggest you keep your feelings in check this time, OK? OK. You're going too fast! Can't you hold your phone still for a second? Make an effort, maybe it really was one of these guys! It's not any of them, man! As far as I can see, he's not here. Good day! I went to see Jartea yesterday. [IN ROMANI] If he lays a finger on you... If he lays one finger on you again, I'll kill him myself! I told them what I know. You did what? I told the cops. The cops? Since when do we talk to the cops?! They’re even worse than Jartea! And now what's your plan?! Running to the cops?! Do you really think he'll leave us alone just because you went to him? [IN ROMANI] That was a very stupid move! Now he'll come after you to get revenge. You never would've gotten rid of him anyway, dad! That’s why rule number one is nobody finds out what Horia saw. Or that he’s an eye witness. Everything must seem normal. - You’ll be with him the whole time? - Yes. But we’ll watch him from a distance. You'll have this on you wherever you go. If you ever feel you’re in danger or you're being or followed, or if anything doesn't feel right, you press this button at once. One of us will be there in two minutes tops. OK? So either Superman or Lara Croft will come to the rescue? Horia, cut it out! Will I be allowed to train in the woods? No! Couldn't you give it up for a while? The county championship is next week! I’ve been training for that half a year now! OK, we’ll see what we can do. Horia saw all the suspect photos and still couldn’t ID the murderer. I don't get it. I have the murder weapon, a witness, all the resources I need, but they do not lead anywhere. And everything’s suspiciously clean. I think we’re not looking where we should. Meaning? We know we’re dealing with a trained assassin here. What Aleodor’s told us confirms Jartea as our main suspect. The vics agreed with a foreigner to steal a shipment from Jartea. He might've found out and had someone, a hired gun, to kill them. We know from the DIICOT they were going to kill someone, maybe the guy they agreed with. Either because that guy stiffed them or they were getting greedier. What's for sure is they didn't get to, Jartea got to them first. That's one theory: dealings within the Roma community. Jartea has a round-the-clock tail. We’ll be on him today at the funeral too. OK, so what's the other theory? The other theory. The killer, who's not Romani, by the way, acted alone. And he's likely involved in something even more serious. Of an internal nature as well! I think we could be dealing with some surprising names and institutions. Romania’s gone from being a transit country to an end market for drugs. And we know that it's not just the mob that benefits from it. What are you getting at? Jartea and his kind are probably thriving thanks to the protection of state institutions. - Aren't you going too far with these? - I'm the one going too far?! OK. Tell me what I can do to help. I want access to the internal files of all state employees with a background in sharp-shooting, anyone from DIICOT, the Counter-Terrorism squads, from Criminal Investigations, from the Army... And I want access to the notifications sent by the SRI to the DNA and and the DIICOT Brasov about high-level corruption cases. And if we find something fishy, no matter who is involved, I'll want a warrant to intercept all phone calls and private information. And I want you to go along with it. But you saw what happened when you did that last time. Back in Bucharest. The last time I did this, I was right. Just like I might be right now. Are you willing to take that risk? You’re hopeless. The warrant won't be an issue. But you can't access internal files without requests, explanations, all the bells and whistles. - Do you see a way to avoid that? - I might have an idea. Shall we go? Let’s wait a little while longer. You don’t really like to stand out. It must have been hard for you back in Bucharest. When you were all over the news. What went down anyway? I heard more versions than I can count. I had a murder case, and a member of a well-known cartel was behind it. I ended up uncovering the whole drug network. A chain that started in the street and ended in the Parliament. Almost every inquiry here ends up in the political arena. And if you insist on going all the way, the head that rolls is yours. "From henceforth now, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors." I want to ask you something. I'd like you to give me access to your internal files. - What for? - My inquiry. I'd like to take a look at them. An inside job? Is this your takeaway from what the witness told you? OK, will do. "And the Spirit saith... Blessed are the dead who die in the Lordfrom henceforth. Yea, saith the Spirit..." I have something to ask too. What did Ceprache’s youngest tell you? We couldn’t get anything out of him. Was there anything that could be of interest to us? He said the victims made a deal with someone, about the product, behind Jartea’s back. Really? Who? He didn’t know. He only said they called him “The German.” And could he tell you anything about the guy? No, that was it. What's that about? Camelia was the one who recruited Cristi Iuga. His wife probably blames her for what happened. There might have been something more between them. [IN ROMANI] I'm sorry, lad. Anything you need, anything. You let me know, you hear? What's that, man? It's like a Nokia from Dacian times! It's a GPS, dummy! So, these guys are watching me. If anything happens, I press this button and presto, my bodyguards come running. - Your "bodyguards," right... - Yes, bro, like in the movies! What the..?! You got spit in my ears! - What did you say? - What if there's a bug? Bullshit! No, Alex would've told me. Maybe he forgot or he didn’t want to make a big deal about it. Say something gross! - Quit it, bro! - Say something extra raunchy! Elena's twat's so wet, you can see it on the GPS! No, sorry, sorry! Scratch that, you can see it on a satellite feed! - Give it back! - No! I won't, so there! - Give it here! You dummy! - What the hell, man?! - Who's the dummy? - Stop! - Who's the dummy? - Get off! Your momma's a dummy! Quit it! Thank you. How long were you with Europol? Officially, two years, when I was living in Berlin. Unofficially, a lot longer than that. - So you’re still working for them? - No. Right now, I’m working for me. - So you haven’t been to Brasov in..? - Ten years. And I have to say, it’s changed a lot, for the better. You and Cristi, were you close? I wonder who could’ve done such a terrible thing. Tell you what! I’d rather not wonder about anything anymore. At least for tonight! COPYING FILES... ARE YOU ASLEEP? Robert? Robert! Aleodor? Aleodor? Dad, I'm going away. I can't stay here anymore. Take care. - Sugar or honey? - Thanks, but I’m in a hurry. By the way, Filip’s decided to go to school today. Finally some good news. Horia must've convinced him. Are you OK with him wanting to stay because Horia convinced him? He should stay for us. To be honest, with the way things have been going, I think we should get more involved, to win back his trust. OK, Silviu, you’ve got kids and I don’t. You’re versed in parenting and I’m just auditioning for the mom part. Isn't that what you keep trying to tell me all the time? And Filip is this yardstick you use to measure the depth of my soul! Come again? You're using him to blackmail me, and to blame me for being cold and careerist! You know what I think? I think this is all about your ego. You woke up in a bad mood, let’s drop it! I’ll go to him and beg his forgiveness for acting like idiots! That would be too humiliating for you, right? No. I think I did everything I could for things to work out. - You think so? - Yes! Filip told me that we took him in to stroke our own egos. To show the world how generous we are! Good bye! - Filip! - Let him go. Please. We'll talk tonight. DATABASE SEARCH BY ADDRESS/PERSON ADDRESSES DATABASE SEARCH RESULTS SEARCH Look how awesome it turned out! I edited it last night. Where were you yesterday? - What? - Where were you? None of your business. Weren’t you supposed to leave? Filip can’t go anywhere without my say-so. - He's under contract! - Yap! He’s my new producer. - Yap. - We'll post a video on YouTube. I can send you the link if you want. VERY COOL #HORIADIACONU! CONGRATS ON THE SPECTACULAR JUMP! HORIA'S MOTORCYCLE JUMP - Laur! - Yes? Morning! Listen. I’m going to Bucharest today - Got a few classified meetings. - OK. I won't come and my phone won't be always on. - Got it. - If I'm needed, you're in charge, OK? Sure, no worries. - Thank you, Dana. - You're welcome. Elena Zamfir speaking... Who is this? Aleodor, is that you? Tell me where again! Aleodor, hang on! Aleodor?! Laur, do you happen to know where Robert is? His phone is off. He's in Bucharest. Is something wrong? Yes. I'll meet you in half an hour at the DIICOT office. - But, Elena... - Half an hour. DIICOT. - Keep trying Robert on the phone. - OK. I don’t know, it's a large-scale op, and without his approval... We're really pressed for time. You have to make up your mind! OK. Let’s do this, we can’t afford to miss this opportunity. - The only unknown here is Jartea. - Ideally, we’ll catch in the act. I want to interrogate him. We don’t know what he’ll do. If he’ll be there at Cheia or not. Chances are he will, seeing as he’s already down one shipment. How will we do this? Isn’t it better to question him when he is in? - Or else he won’t tell you anything. - Prep the team for Cheia. I’ll go with Barbu to Jartea’s. See what he’s up to. - We’ll keep in touch. - Perfect. Jartea’s Ford. Follow that Ford. [IN ROMANI] The boys are off! OK. Stay on its tail. The Ford took the road to Harman. Nowhere near Cheia. What now? We wait for Jartea to come out. Go, go, go, lads! Go, guys! Let's get this fuckers! There he is! - Go, Elena, I'm here. - We're right behind him. He's driving a white Logan. Brasov plates, 03BBRA. It's just passing Bradet. I'll call back when we're close. Great! Thanks. - Cozma, do you read? - Yes, Laur. The princess is coming. We move into position and wait for him to arrive. The transport's here. Yes. OK. Let's hope so. Come on, you're not pencil pushers, what's with the snail pace? Go on, get a move on, before these oranges go bad! Go on, lads, let's hurry this along! Stop! Get down! Hands behind your heads! Hands behind your head! What? What's that they found there? I didn't know anything about this. He called me down here! Told me someone sent him a truck full of oranges, and told him to keep the product, but not the truck. And Grafi found a client already, only he needed a means of transport. That's the truth! What? What's with the faces? He said he got it from a Turk who owed him money... - Cash! - Yeah, he couldn't pay cash, so he paid him in oranges. I'm only here for the oranges. I didn’t know what that guy put in the floor either, I swear it on my mother! I called Mr. Nicu, this man here, to help me with this truck, so I could take the oranges to the customer. And to cap it all off we burst in and ruined your rendez-vous! What a gross case of abuse! DIICOT is in cahoots with DA Zamfir again! How you talked out of your ass to the media. I don't talk out of there, I pass gas! Go on, take them away! But you have nothing on me! It's a set-up! Are you serious?! Again?! Again?! Is he taking a break there? He's been in that spot for a while now. I'll call him. How far is it? I can go there and see what he's up to. No, I'll go. - What are you doing here? - This piece of shit got too hot. Why don't you have your phone? Oh, sorry, I forgot to get it from my bag. How much do you plan to be out here? I'll just do another lap. - What's up? - Nothing. - What if Filip walked in on us? - Let's not waste any time, then. No, no, no! Horia! Horia! Horia! Horia! Horia! Horia! Horia! Horia! Camelia! Camelia! Horia, can you hear me?! Horia! - Horia!!! - Easy does it! Horia! Horia! - Horia! - Wait! Easy, easy! Horia! Horia! - Do you have your phone? - Yes! Call the cops, 1-1-2!
