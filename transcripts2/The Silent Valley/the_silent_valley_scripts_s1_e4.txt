 SILENT VALLEY - How long was he underwater? - About three minutes. Did you find any injuries on his body, or any trace of violence? No. Start compressions! Bag him! Clear! Continue compressions! I need the EKG, with his sats and BP checked every 5 minutes. Get me an EKG printout too. He bounced back from the heart attack. He's stable. Let's get some fresh air, come...

 What did the nurse say? You didn't want me hearing it, right? No, Filip! She just wanted to talk to them. They're his parents. He's dead, isn't he?! Why won't you tell me the truth? Horia is alive, Filip. - Let's leave them alone. - Not until he comes to! - Let's go, please... - Not untill I know he's okay! Fine. Silviu, let him be... HORIA'S BIKE JUMP FILIP HAS UPDATED HIS PROFILE PICTURE - Hello. - Come in! We seized the payload! - You what!? - Elena got a tip. - Elena did? Who from? - Ceprache's kid, Aleodor. - We got Jartea red-handed. - Only I didn't want to catch Jartea!

 He was just the bait. You told me to take over if anything turned up, and I did try calling you. - Where's Jartea now? - We're holding him at HQ. - And the shipment? - In a depot in Cheia, under watch. - Who else knows about this? - No one. Ok, we can still turn this around. I'll see you at HQ, first thing tomorrow. - See you. - Bye. The accident happened right here. - You didn't tell anyone about Horia? - No, no way. And you didn't see anyone hanging around? No. Why do you ask? Because this was no accident. Hi, Alex. - How's he doing? - Not good. But at least he's stable. If only I had been closer... Hey, it's not your fault. What were you supposed to do, go chasing after his moped? - Yes. - No. It was an accident. Were you here all night? Hey, so... have you ever shot anyone? No. Fortunately. But... ...if you had to, would you? Why do you ask? Sometimes I'm glad I don't have a gun. If I had one, I'd shoot all the assholes... Then I'd tell myself they got off too easy. They should have a thousand lives, like in a video game. I'd kill them, they'd come back, and I'd kill them again... Till they're down to their last life so they're begging me to spare them. And I'd take that last life too, just so they know what it feels like to lose something for real. - You care a lot for Horia, don't you? - I am. Are you married? No. You're seeing someone though, right? Is it a secret? Sort of. Suffice to say I'm seeing someone but it's complicated. For me as well. Meaning that nobody knows? - My mom knows. - Elena, right... Elena's my aunt. - I didn't know. - Yes. My mother's in jail. Drugs... I'm sorry. What about your dad? I've never met him. Me neither. I've never met my own father, I mean. - Hello! - Morning! How are you? I'm at the hospital. Our witness had an accident. - An accident? - Yes, he's in a coma. In a coma? That's terrible... - What do the doctors say? - He's stable, but critical. - I'm sorry. - It's my fault. Camelia, stop it! No, it wasn't! - It was! - No, it wasn't! - Okay. - We'll talk later. Take care! - Okay, then. Bye. - Bye. We couldn't get anything out of him. Whatever he's got up his sleeve, he's not talking. I tried every trick in the book... Now he's waiting for his lawyer. Listen here, limp dick! I'm the guy the Cepraches were in league with. I stole your shipment at the border and I killed all four in the woods! I made a career out of squashing filth like you! I'm having a shitty day, so I'll say this once: fuck your rights! If you don't cooperate, I'll kill your family and I'll make sure someone kills you too, in prison! You know full well I can keep that promise! Horia? Horia! Can you hear me? Can you hear me? It's me, Filip! Hello, you! What the hell are you doing? What is this?! - He woke up! - What? Horia! Horia, can you hear me? Horia, son... Please leave the room! There's no pulse. Clear! Compressions! Come, Filip... Come away... Let's go... - Please get this kid out of here! - What? Who? Stay away from my boy! Do you hear me? Come on, let's go... We're leaving. Come... What was all that about with Radu? And why did he tell you to stay away from Horia? Filip, whatever it is, you know you can trust me, right? I want to talk to Elena. - Thanks for the tip. I'm impressed. - You're welcome. How's it going with Jartea? I need to question him. He's decided to cooperate. Give me 24 hours and then you can have him. Is something wrong? I want you to have a talk with the protective detail. The witness is in hospital, in a coma. I have reasons to believe that it wasn't an accident. Really? Sorry to hear that. What are your reasons though? He is in Witness Protection after all... Someone had access to confidential information and used them to make an attempt on his life. Are you saying one of my people is a rat? Not necessarily one of yours. But I'm not ruling it out. I'm sorry. Elena, but I'll need more proof before I start doubting my own people! I have no proof. But this isn't a possibility I can afford to ignore. All right. I'm on it. Thanks. - Yes, Silviu. - Can you talk? Could you come home? Filip wants to talk to you. It sounds important. - Are you okay? - Hanging in there. Hey, Alex! Sit down, please. I'll get right to it. Elena Zamfir's asked me to have a talk with you about... ...well, you'll imagine what about. And she's right to ask. I was the one who recommended you after all. - Is she accusing us? - No, but... It's only natural that we check for a potential leak. Did anything feel suspect while you were watching him? - Not at all, everything looked okay. - Were the tracking devices safe? Yes. Did you ever tell anyone where you were? - No. - Were you alone in the woods? We didn't see anyone actually. Not even a jogger, no one. Who else knew about you being there? The family of the witness and his best friend, Filip. - Filip? - Elena's foster son. He was there, in the woods, with me and Horia. I didn't know Elena had a foster kid. Me neither. He told me at the hospital. I'd assumed Elena was his birth mother. Okay. Thanks. That settles it. When he saw me, he aimed the gun at me. I saw him out of the corner of my eye. I was sure I was about to die. And then he just collapsed. That's when I saw Horia standing behind him with a rock in his hand. Horia saved my life. Horia didn't get a good look at him, but I remember him clearly. - And you could recognize him? - Yes. Especially since I saw him on the train the next day, on the trip back from my mum's. Why would you keep all of this bottled up? I promised Horia. What, you don't believe me? I do. I believe you. - Pronto? - Boss, it's me. What the hell are you up to? Three times I tried calling! Why is your phone off? Where's the shipment? Safety measures, boss. The shipment's still in Cheia. The delay is 'cause... I was there at Giurgiu with the lads, we took another route and... ...we also loaded the stuff into another truck. You did what?! I did everything I had to, to get it there. Better a day late, than never, right? But you say the word and I'll clear it for the border. So you think Customs is like your mom's legs, is just gonna open up for you, whenever it suits you?! Boss, you gave me free rein to solve the problem how I saw fit! Hello!? Boss? Hello?! Keep the stuff there. I'll get back to you with instructions. - So what do we do now? - Nothing. Now we wait. What are you doing? We need to leave as soon as possible. I won't let Filip go through what went Horia. Are you sure this is the best way? This killer is close and someone on the inside is giving him information. - We can't trust anyone now! - What about your job? I'd rather drop the case than expose Filip. Now?! It's the worst time for that! He won't be safe until you've solved it and you know it! Let's go! - I'll come get the shipment myself. - Why? There's no need. I can handle it just fine. That's for me to decide. It's safer this way. I'll call you later to tell you where and when to bring the stuff. I didn't get a clear pass through customs yet. Okay, boss. It's settled. What do you reckon he'll do? Should we get ready? No. We'll wait for his next move, that's when we'll know his angle. It's crucial we don't spook the prey. I don't want to risk botching this up. - Can I have my cell back now? - No. - Why not? - I left it back home. I got you another one. And a new number too. What am I supposed to do with this piece of crap? You're not to give anyone this number. This model can't be traced by GPS unless someone knows your number. What happened to Horia wasn't an accident. - It wasn't? - No. It's why we checked in under a false name. We need to be very careful. You can't leave this room for now. - Yes, Barbu. - Mrs. Elena, I'm at the DA's office. - Is it done? - I brought the recording. - Good. Leave it there. - Of course. - Can you put Dana on, please? - Yes, here's Mrs. Dana now. - Hello? - The recording is confidential. - Yes. I understand. - And I need it ASAP. Yes. I'll send it over now. - Use my personal email, okay? - Yes, I got it. - Is this everything? - Yes. - Good day. - Goodbye. Filip! Come here, please! I want you to look at something. I got this footage from the Braşov station, covering the time you got off the train. See if you spot him, okay? Stop! There! - Are you sure it's him? - Yes! I recognize his cap. It's him. I have to go in to work, see what I can do. Then I'll go by the hospital. - Did you get the photo I emailed? - Yes. Please talk to a tech guy. I need a close-up. I want as many details, and the clearest image possible. - Barbu, please put a rush on it! - Sure. I'm on it. I'll call when it's done. He's been stable for the past 24 hours. The doctors will try to bring him out of the induced coma tomorrow. - Thank you. - No worries. - Didn't Filip come with you? - No. Does this ring a bell? Maybe you spotted him while watching Horia? No, I don't think so, the photo's just too blurry. - Filip's to blame for everything. - That's your problem? Not to mention we don't know if Horia's like that too! He turned my son into a faggot, now look where it got him! If I ever see him around here again, I don't know what I'll do! This cannot stand! - Hello, Elena! - Hi. Hello, Radu. I'm sorry. It's too blurred. Isn't there a clearer shot? It's being processed now. Until it's ready, maybe you can run this through your database. Maybe you're already trailing him and he'll show up in footage. - Are you sure it's him? - No doubt. But how? Isn't your witness in a coma? Or is this another witness? All right, I'll see what I can do. - How long am I gonna be here for? - Until everything's sorted. Did you go? How's Horia? - There's no change. - I have to go to the hospital! I have to go see him! Who knows if I get another chance! The doctors have assured me he's stable. What can't you understand?! I don't care one bit what the doctors say! I have to be by his side! I need to be there, with him! Please! Filip, we said we'd talk about what happened at the hospital. Why doesn't Radu want you to go there anymore? What happened at the hospital? Radu didn't even say hi to me today. Filip? Filip! The night of the murder, Horia and I... Things happened... between us ...in the cabin. That's why we didn't say anything about the murder. What sort of things? I think I'm gay. You mean... Were you born like that? Because that would make it better or what?! No, I... what I mean is... At your age everything's confusing and it's natural to... ...experiment and think that you're this way or that and... Then you realize it was a nonsense. This nonsense happens every day for me! I think you kids see too much of this on TV, and it's trendy to be gay these days. These things can influence you. Here you go again! I couldn't know myself better than you do, right?! All I know is you've been through a lot lately. - I think you should take it to him. - He'll come when he gets hungry. I don't think it's really the right time to talk to him. Yes, the time is never right with you. So why don't you go talk to him then? I'm guessing you know just what to say to him, right?! I think you've never really known, so you put the pressure on me. Because you made waves. You created problems between him and us that only you could've solved, if you'd gained his trust! You mean if I'd gained his trust, he wouldn't be gay, or what? Are you actually hung up on that?! No matter how kind and understanding you've been, he still kept you in the dark? Don't even try telling me that's why you kept the case! - You did it because you love it! - And what if I did?! Since when is doing what you love a crime? You could stand finding something to do yourself! Don't turn this around on me! Just tell me how we're going to handle this! How? You'll play the smart Alec, as usual, and I, well... - The Italian called back! - What did he say? He arranged at the customs tonight to take his stuff at 02:00. From the warehouse in Cheia? He'll tell Jartea where to meet half an hour beforehand. Jackpot! Gather the men! Is he up? I don't know. I knocked, he didn't answer. This can't be happening! - Hi, Liliana. - Hi. Is Filip at the hospital? - No. Is anything wrong? - No, it's nothing... It's just that he's turned off his phone. - Who knows? Maybe... - I have to go, Liliana. Maybe he went to see Ana-Maria. I'm calling the prison now. - It's busy. - Let's just go, we're wasting time! I kept calling these last few days, but you didn't answer! - Is anything wrong? - No. I've just really missed you. I lost my phone. I've got a new number. Can you write it down somewhere? Thanks! - Go ahead. - 0777... ...605-765. Okay. Now will you please tell me what happened? I told them. I told Elena and Silviu... you know, about... - And? - I don't know... It's going to be really hard, mom. It was hard enough before they knew. Elena, who cares so much about her image... ...raising a damaged child... Hush, it's okay... Hush, hush... The Italian gave Jartea a time to meet to check and hand over the stuff. He'll come himself, so he'll definitely have company. He didn't say where, so he doesn't trust him anymore and he's suspicious. We don't know his plans for Jartea, but that's not our main concern now. We must follow the Italian to see where he leads us, who's waiting across the border. It's the big fish I'm after. As such, the drugs stay in the truck and we cut them loose. Whatever the meeting point, he only has two ways to go: Bucharest or Braşov. I think it's not far from the depot, seeing as he'll only disclose it half an hour in advance. We'll have Jartea in the main truck with one of us, in case he gets any ideas. We'll need two checkpoints, about 5 km out from the warehouse. There'll be 5 guys and an empty truck stationed at each. I'll need a driver and an agent riding in each truck cab. Laur, which do you prefer? Braşov. And Marinescu takes Bucharest. Braşov... Laur. Bucharest... Marinescu. Since he can't trust Jartea, the Italian will have the truck tailed from the warehouse to the meeting spot. Which he'll also secure. Key to Operation "Cheia"... ...is to get one of the empty trucks to the hand-off spot, before Jartea gets there with the drugs. We need to be there first. And then follow the payload without drawing the attention. We keep radio contact. Depending on how the hand-off goes, we'll adjust. - Any questions? - No. In that case, gear up! Laur, take charge of your teams. I'm here about Filip. He ran away. Some time last night, I think. You're to blame for that. - What do you mean? - He came by and told me everything! - When? - This morning. Hold on! So you knew he had fled and didn't think to tell me? I didn't know he had fled! He came to tell me what a burden it would be for madam DA Elena Zamfir to have a degenerate under her roof. Did you always know that he's...? - You knew, didn't you? - Knew what? Go on, spit it out! Or you can't even utter the word? I can only imagine what a big thorn we must be in your side! A felon for a sister and a queer for a nephew! A sister who plays the perfect mom from behind bars! Who had no idea that Filip had to pass his exams and needed tutoring to get into a good high school in Bucharest. How fortunate that Madam DA took care of all that. As she took care of dad after mom passed, while the favorite daughter dropped by rarely, to hit him up for money to buy drugs! Oh you thought I didn't know? And he was always taking your side! His troubled little girl would come to her senses, 'she's growing up at her own pace, ' he'd say! It's so easy playing wise when you're behind bars! Let's not forget who put me in here. Sure. I'm to blame for your drug-dealing! I thought you still had an ounce of decency left. And then you go and poison Filip with your lies! I also came to tell you that Filip is a witness in the Silent Valley case. And now he's out and about while the killer's around here somewhere! What?! - Your son called. Filip, is it? - Yes! He wants you to call him, he said it's urgent. - Hello? - Filip! Is something wrong? No, why? I was told you called and that it was urgent. No, mom, I didn't call. Everything's fine, don't worry! Where are you? On the train, we've just passed Sinaia. Filip, Elena's here with me. How could you run away when you know how dangerous it is?! Because I had to see you, you and Horia! Filip! Filip! - Did he say why he called? - He didn't. It was a mix-up. - Where is he? - On the train, in Sinaia. He said he needed to go see Horia. Robert! - Ready to go? - Do you really need to ask? I'll be close. I'll be a few minutes tops once we know the location. - Call as soon as you know. - The teams are in position already. - I'm heading out now too. - Great. I'll be in touch on the radio. Good luck! Let's hope! Let's go, lads! - Hello. - What's up, man? - All good. The daily grind. - Yeah? Dăscălescu, I hit a snag, it's about an inquiry. Go on... I need the calls made from Târgşor Penitentiary in the last 10 minutes. Out of Târgşor? You only need the outgoing calls? Yes, over the past 10 minutes. Let me work on it. I'll log into the system and get back to you. Okay. I'll wait for your call. Thanks. No problem. - Hi! - Hi. - Just you? - Silviu dropped me off. He had some errands in town anyway. - Is Radu around? - No. It's just Liliana. Okay. I'll go in. - Hello! - Hi, Filip. - Hi, Elena! - Hello, Liliana. - Is Filip there yet? - Yes, he's here... He's with Horia. Keep him there. We're on our way. Of course... He's not going anywhere. Thanks, Liliana. We got the location from the Italian! He's mine now! It's past the tight curves on the road to Cheia, before the slope down to Braşov. In that big parking lot? - That's right. I'm off, on my way. - Great. Keep me updated! - You've got Angry Birds on the phone? - Yes. And now I'm addicted! I'd use a cup of coffee. Do you want anything? Wait for me, yeah? - Hello? - Hi, where are you? Work? - Yes, at the hospital. - Are you alone? No, I'm with a friend of Horia's. You? - Filip, are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. - We're on our way to you. I wanted... - Camelia's boyfriend is the killer! I saw his photo on her phone! - I think she's talking to him right now! - What?! - Silviu, can you hear me? Silviu? - Where are you? I'm outside, by the entrance. Go at the reception desk and stay there till we come! Okay. Hello? - Is this Filip Zamfir? - Yes. - I'm Dr. Milescu, from Târgşor Pen. - Did something happen? No... I mean, yes. Your mom's out of danger now, but she's had an episode. It's best we talk in person. Can you come by? Yes, of course. I'm on my way! Relax. That won't help. - Where's Filip? - I don't know, he was just here. You were on the phone just before he left. I want to know who. - That was a personal call. - Tell me who you spoke to! Where's Robert now? Is he here? No, he's working a sting op. Horia wasn't the only witness. Filip was with him. He called me to tell me the guy you are on the phone with is the killer! He recognized him by his photo. Robert is the killer? Come again?! Did you tell him that Filip was here? Yes... I think I did... I had no idea... Robert, do you hear me? Robert? Yes, Laur. He just arrived. The Italian's men are here too. Okay. I'm on my way now. I'll be there in ten. He's got Filip. He used Ana-Maria to get his number, found out he was here, and he took him. - How come he just took him?! - I don't know. Laur told me where the op is. Robert will be there any minute! - Silviu, stay with Horia! - You can't exclude me! I'll check in later. Get in! Any progress? No. They're still checking the drugs. I think he's calling the Italian now. Okay. Keep your eyes peeled! What do you reckon? Is he taking the bait or... Hold on! What the hell's this now?! Laur! Follow that truck and get them! Roger that! Contact home base and ask for a chopper! Have them talk to Laur! They're to follow the trucks! - What are you doing?! - We must talk. We're in the middle of something! You blew up the op! Filip is missing. - Who? - The second witness. My nephew. No idea what you're on about. I know everything, Robert! It's the end of the line! Where is Filip? You'll be doing yourself a favor by handing him over! Elena... - Put down the gun! - Robert! Stop! Send an ambulance! We have an officer down! - What the hell was that? - So help me, I don't know! - Was it the cops? - No! It's that DA who's investigating the murders! No! What the hell was she doing there? I don't know. I swear! Please! Step on it! Hands up! Out! Get out! Out! We seized the drug transporter. Come get it. What the hell happened? Agent Bădoi was shot, they're taking her to hospital. - What?! Is she...? - No, it's a shoulder wound. She tried to shoot Robert. What?! Stay there, I'm on my way! - Roger that. - Let's move! Robert! Put your hands up! Drop the gun! If you budge I'll shoot and we'll both die. It's over, Robert! Drop the gun! The Italian's free and clear! He pushes drugs across the continent and you're letting him get away! Drop your gun! Now! I'm sorry it's come to this. We can still sort this out between us. What about the four people you shot at that cabin? - What about Horia? - That was self-defense. I had no idea there was an CI among them. - What would you've done in my shoes? - Let him go or I'll shoot! Do you think the world's a better place with me gone? Elena, we're not that different, you and I! I thought you of all people would understand. If you let me walk, I'll let the kid go once I get somewhere safe. Put the gun down, this is your final warning! I've always wondered what's on the other side. But I've been scared to go alone. It's over! SILENT VALLEY End of series
