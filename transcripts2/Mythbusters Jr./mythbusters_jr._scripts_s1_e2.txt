 -FLIP THE SWITCH. [ SWITCH CLICKS ] -AH. -YOU ALL RIGHT? YOU'RE GETTING A VERY, VERY REGULAR MYTHBUSTERS' KIND OF DAY, -WHOA! -OH, MY GOSH! [ WHISTLES ] Narrator: THEN THE UNMISTAKABLE SMELL OF WET DOG FILLS THE AIR. RILEY DOES NOT LOOK GREAT WHEN SHAKING. THE MYTH IS THAT ANY DOG CAN SHAKE OFF 70% OF THEIR WATER WEIGHT IN A SINGLE SHAKE SESSION. Narrator: AND THE MYTHBUSTERS' CHALLENGE IS NOT TO DROWN IN THE PROCESS. AWESOME.

 ♪♪ YES, I'M BACK WITH A BRAND-NEW TEAM OF THE BEST BUILDERS, THE BRIGHTEST MINDS AND THE BOLDEST BUSTERS I COULD FIND. YES, THEY'RE A BUNCH OF KIDS, BUT THE MYTHS, THEY ARE AS FULL-SIZED AND AS EXPLOSIVE AS EVER. THIS IS "MYTHBUSTERS JR." -[ EXPLOSION ] -OH! CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS ♪♪ THIS MYTH PROMISES TO DELIVER TWO BANGS FOR THE BUCK AND COMES COURTESY OF THE INTERWEBS. THAT'S TWO EXPLOSIVE URBAN LEGENDS FEATURING THE SAME PRODUCT, AND THAT IS SPRAY AIR FRESHENER. NOW, IN THE FIRST, AN ODIFEROUS CAR SPRAYED FULL OF AIR FRESHENER BY AN OVEREAGER TEEN SUPPOSEDLY EXPLODES WHEN THE CAR'S INTERIOR LIGHT COMES IN. IN THE SECOND, A SLOW-LEAKING CAN CAUSES A BIT OF BLOW UP WHEN THE OWNER TRIES TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE. SO THAT IS THE MYTH. CAN AIR FRESHENER CAUSE A CAR TO EXPLODE? Narrator: WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION, JUST HOW FLAMMABLE ARE SPRAY CAN AIR FRESHENERS, AND DO THEY CONTAIN ONE OF ADAM'S LEAST FAVORITE THINGS? FLAMMABLE GASES ARE WITHOUT A DOUBT THE SCARIEST THING THAT WE DEALT WITH OVER ALL THE YEARS OF "MYTHBUSTERS." WHOA! WE'VE LIT CARS ON FIRE THAT GOT OUT OF CONTROL. Woman: THREE, TWO, ONE. [ CHEERING ] OH, MAN! STUFF'S STILL DROPPING. I THINK THIS IS FREAKING CONFIRMED. RIGHT, AND I SEEM TO REMEMBER LOSING AN EYEBROW AT ONE POINT. [ BEEPS, EXPLOSION ] AM I MISSING AN EYEBROW? OKAY, THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE STUPIDEST THINGS WE'VE EVER DONE. THE THING ABOUT FLAMMABLE GASES IS THEY'RE INVISIBLE, SO WHEN THEY'RE IN A SPACE, YOU DON'T KNOW, AND IN REPLICATING THE STORIES ABOUT THEM, YOU OFTEN HAVE TO GET THIS PERFECT STORM MIX OF GAS TO OXYGEN TO IGNITION, WHICH MEANS THEY'RE BOTH DANGEROUS AND TRICKY TO REPLICATE. UGH, I DREAD FLAMMABLE GASES. Narrator: THE FIRST JOB FOR ALLIE, JESSE, AND VALERIE IS TO TEST WHICH ONE OF THESE FIVE OFF-THE-SHELF AIR FRESHENERS MAY CONTAIN, YOU GUESSED IT, FLAMMABLE GAS. ♪♪ AND TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T SINGE ANY EYEBROWS, MYTHBUSTERS' EXPERT FABRICATOR, JON MARCU, HAS PUT TOGETHER A TEST RIG THAT'S SIMPLE AND SAFE. STICK ONE OVER HERE. YOU PUSH IT DOWN, JUST LIKE THE STICKER SAYS. THAT LIGHTS YOUR TORCH. PUSH DOWN NUMBER TWO, THAT SENDS YOUR AEROSOL AND FLAMES FIRING UP ALL THE WAY INTO THE CEILING. THAT SOUNDS AWESOME. Narrator: ALL AEROSOL CANS USE SOME KIND OF COMPRESSED GAS LIKE PROPANE OR ISOBUTANE AS PROPELLANTS. THE TEAM HOPES TO I.D. THE MOST FLAMMABLE SPRAY FOR THIS MYTH BY MEASURING THE HEIGHT OF THE FLAMES AGAINST A SCALE MARKED IN TWO-INCH INCREMENTS. -YOU GUYS READY? -YES. OKAY, TORCH IN THREE, TWO, ONE. AEROSOL IN THREE, TWO, ONE. Jesse: WOW. Narrator: ALREADY THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS. Jesse: AIR FRESHENER NUMBER ONE WAS SIX PINK LINES UP, SO THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING TO PUT OUR MARK, RIGHT THERE. THAT'S ONE DOWN AND FOUR MORE TO GO. ♪♪ ALL RIGHT. THIS IS AEROSOL NUMBER TWO IN THREE, TWO, ONE. OH, THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD. Narrator: AND WHAT'S GOOD IN REAL LIFE ALWAYS LOOKS BETTER ON HIGH SPEED. Jesse: OKAY, SO I LOOKED ON THE HIGH SPEED FOR NUMBER TWO AND IT WAS FOUR PINK LINES DOWN. PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE FROM NUMBER ONE. Narrator: IN FACT, THE SAME AMOUNT OF SPRAY PRODUCED TWICE THE FLAME. AT THIS RATE, THEIR NEXT ATTEMPT COULD BURN THE ROOF OFF. AIR FRESHENER NUMBER THREE IN THREE, TWO, ONE. [ WHIRRING ] -WHAT? -[ LAUGHS ] IT'S, LIKE, NOT EVEN GOING. YOU COULD SEE THE TINIEST BIT OF ORANGE, BUT IT DID BASICALLY NOTHING. -SO THIS IS A BUST. -YEAH, BASICALLY. I GUESS THAT ONE IS NOT FLAMMABLE. Narrator: THAT'S BECAUSE SOME COMMON AEROSOL PROPELLANTS SIMPLY AREN'T COMBUSTIBLE. SO ON TO CAN NUMBER FOUR. -IT'S NOT DOING ANYTHING EITHER. -IT'S NOT DOING ANYTHING? -NO, LOOK. YEAH, SEE? -OH. Narrator: AND HOW ABOUT CAN NUMBER FIVE? THIS ONE IS JUST PRETTY DISAPPOINTING AS WELL. YEP. NUMBER THREE, FOUR, AND FIVE WERE DEFINITELY A BUST, BUT NUMBER TWO DEFINITELY WENT THE HIGHEST OUT OF ALL OF THEM. -NUMBER TWO IT IS. -NUMBER TWO. ♪♪ THEY'VE GOT WHAT THEY WANTED -- A BUTANE-BASED AIR FRESHENER WITH THE POTENTIAL TO BLOW UP A CAR. AND IT'S ON FIRE. -OH. -DON'T WORRY. Narrator: BUT WHILE THEY PREPARE TO WREAK HAVOC IN THE WORKSHOP, IT'S TIME TO PLUNGE INTO MYTH NUMBER TWO. ♪♪ THIS NEXT MYTH COMES COURTESY OF MAN'S BEST FRIEND, OR SHOULD I SAY HUMAN'S BEST FRIEND, EVERYONE'S FAVORITE FOUR-LEGGED COMPANION -- DOGS. IT IS SAID THAT A WET DOG CAN SHAKE OUT 70% OF THE WATER IN ITS FUR IN ITS FIRST SHAKE. 70%, IT IS AN ASTOUNDING NUMBER. THE QUESTION IS, IS IT AN ACCURATE ONE? WELL, IT SOUNDS REALLY IMPRESSIVE, BUT IS IT TRUE? THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. RIGHT, AND WE'RE BRINGING IN AN EXPERT THAT CANNAN KNOWS. -HIS NAME IS? -CLAUSE. CLAUSE. BRING IN CLAUSE. [ WHISTLES ] Narrator: IT'S TIME FOR THE OTHER MYTHBUSTERS TO MEET ONE MEMBER OF CANNAN'S EXTENDED FAMILY. OH, HO, HO, HO. AW. WHAT KIND OF DOG IS HE? HE'S A RESCUE DOG, SO WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE. WELL, YOU GUYS HAVE YOUR TEST PLATFORM HERE, NAMED CLAUSE. YOU HAVE THE MYTH. IT'S TIME FOR YOU GUYS TO GO GATHER SOME WET DOG DATA. -OKAY. -HAVE FUN. Narrator: CLAUSE IS THE LATEST IN A LONG LINE OF MYTHBUSTERS' CANINE COLLABORATORS. CAN YOU GUESS WHAT MY ROLE IS TODAY? Narrator: PERHAPS THE BEST LOVED OF ALL WAS MORGAN, WHO WE MET WHEN ADAM AND JAMIE SET OUT TO BEAT THE BLOODHOUND. Adam: SMELL. GET HIM. Narrator: ADAM DID HIS DARNDEST TO AVOID BEING TRACKED. HE TRIED ZIGZAGGING AND DOUBLING BACK... THAT'S A GOOD BOY. WHERE IS HE? GOOD BOY! Narrator: ...CHANGING HIS GETAWAY CLOTHES... -OH! -THAT'S A GOOD BOY. Narrator: ...THAT OLD CLASSIC, RUNNING THROUGH WATER... Adam: IT TOOK HIM LESS TIME THAN THE FIRST TWO TESTS. YOU'RE JUST A STINKY GUY, WHAT CAN I SAY? [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: ...EVEN DOUSING HIMSELF WITH STRONG SMELLING COLOGNE AND COFFEE, ALL TO ABSOLUTELY NO AVAIL. OH, HO, HO. -YOU FOUND ME. -WHAT A GOOD BOY. Narrator: BACK AT THE SHOP, IT'S ALMOST BATH TIME. SO WE HAVE A PLAN. WE HAVE THE POOL, WE HAVE THE SCALE, AND WE HAVE OUR LITTLE CLAUSE, SO THE FIRST THING WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GONNA WEIGH HIM NORMALLY, THEN WE'RE GONNA GIVE HIM A BATH. Narrator: GETTING HIS DRY WEIGHT OF 19.4 POUNDS IS THE EASY PART. NOW IT'S TIME TO GET WET. OH, NO. NO. NO. NOT TOO HIGH. -OKAY. -JUST RIGHT ON HIM. RIGHT, THERE WE GO. Narrator: WITH EIGHT DOGS AT HOME, RACHEL'S GOT BATH TIME DOWN PAT. ELIJAH, NOT SO MUCH. Elijah: YEAH, I HAVE NO DOGS. I'M A CAT PERSON. WELL, I LIKE CATS. I'M NOT -- LIKE, I'M NOT A FURRY. Narrator: EVERY FIBER OF THIS FURRY FRAME WANTS TO SHIMMY FROM NOSE TO TAIL. THE HARDEST PART WAS NOT GETTING THE DOGS TO SHAKE BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS SHAKE. Narrator: ELIJAH GRABS A READING OF 20.4 POUNDS NOT A SECOND TOO SOON. THAT WAS ALL UP IN MY FACE. [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: THEN IT'S BACK ON THE SCALE FOR THOSE VITAL POST-SHAKE PARTICULARS. Elijah: 20.1 POUNDS. YAY! GOOD BOY, CLAUSE. Narrator: .3 OF A POUND DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH, BUT MATH GENIUS AND COLLEGE SOPHOMORE, CANNAN, SOON CONFIRMS THAT THE MYTH IS OFF TO A PROMISING START. THE RESULTS ARE THAT CLAUSE LOST ABOUT 60% OF HIS WATER WEIGHT IN ONE SHAKE CYCLE. Rachel: IT'S NOT 70%, BUT IT'S STILL VERY IMPRESSIVE. Narrator: IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH FOR ELIJAH TO PROPOSE HIS PET THEORY OF COMPARATIVE SPECIES SHAKING. WE'RE GONNA TEST TO SEE IF HUMANS CAN SHAKE WATER OUT OF THEIR HAIR JUST LIKE DOGS CAN SHAKE WATER OUT OF THEIR FUR. Narrator: NO PRIZES FOR GUESSES WHICH HUMAN. JUST LIKE CLAUSE, ELIJAH FIRST GETS WEIGHED DRY. THEN IT'S DUNK TIME. IN THREE, TWO, ONE, GO, DOWN. THANK YOU. [ LAUGHS ] WELL, THAT WAS... [ LAUGHS ] -GO. -OH. Narrator: ELIJAH'S NOW WEIGHED WITH HIS MANE RINGING WET AND THEN... OH, MY... -[ LAUGHS ] -WHOA. -ELIJAH? ELIJAH. -[ LAUGHS ] Narrator: SO LET'S GET THE DATA ON DUDE VERSUS DOG. Elijah: I GAINED 0.7 POUNDS AFTER MY HAIR WAS SOAKED, AND I LOST 0.2 POUNDS WHEN I, LIKE, SHOOK OUT MY HAIR. OKAY, MATH MAN, WHAT IS THAT IN PERCENTAGE? THAT IS 28.5% OF THE WATER LOST. Narrator: NOT TOO SHABBY. STILL, NO MATCH FOR CLAUSE. BUT TO GIVE THIS MYTH A FAIR SHAKE, THEY'LL NEED A MUCH BIGGER SAMPLE SIZE. COMING UP, THE MYTHBUSTERS RELEASE THE HOUNDS. IT'S BEEN LICKING ME A LOT. HEY, HI. ♪♪ Narrator: EXPLORING THE MYTH OF A RANDOM SPARK OR A CIGARETTE TRIGGERING AN EXPLOSION IN A CAR FULL OF AIR FRESHENER, THE MYTHBUSTERS AND JON SET UP FOR SMALL-SCALE TESTING. THEY'RE WORKING ON THE PREMISE THAT A FULL CAN WAS EXPENDED IN THE CAR, AND AS THE BLAST BOX THEY'RE BUILDING IS 13% OF THE VOLUME OF A STANDARD SEDAN, THEY'LL NEED TO DETERMINE 13% OF A SPRAY CAN'S VOLUME. FOR THIS NEXT TEST, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO EMPTY THIS CAN OF AIR FRESHENER, AND I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE PRODUCTIVE IF WE EMPTIED IT OUT SOMEPLACE THAT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF HELP. THIS IS THE BATHROOM THAT ALL THE SHOP GUYS USE, PRETTY SELF-EXPLANATORY. Narrator: BY TIMING IT OUT, ALLIE CAN FIGURE THE APPROPRIATE DOSE FOR THE SMALL SCALE IN MINUTES AND SECONDS. Allie: OKAY, WE ARE AT FOUR MINUTES NOW. I HAVE THE FEELING I'M GONNA BE HERE FOR A WHILE. Narrator: THE TOILET TEST CAN EVENTUALLY TAPS OUT AT ABOUT 14 MINUTES. NOW ALLIE CAN CRUNCH THE NUMBERS. SO IF WE TAKE 13% OF 14 MINUTES, THEN WE GET 1 MINUTE AND 47 SECONDS OF SPRAY TIME THAT WE SHOULD SPRAY THE SPRAY CAN IN OUR SMALL-SCALE TEST. Narrator: THEIR FIRST TEST MIMICS THE FIRST MYTH SCENARIO, THAT A CAR OVER SPRAYED WITH AIR FRESHENER COULD EXPLODE WITH A RANDOM SPARK. HERE THAT SPARK IS SUPPLIED BY A NEON TRANSFORMER VIA THE FINGERTIPS OF JESSE'S MAGIC MERLIN. GOOD LUCK, LITTLE DUDE. Narrator: ALL THE REMAINS IS TO FIT A LID ONTO THEIR BOOM BOX. NOW THIS PAPER TAPE MIGHT LOOK A LITTLE WEAK, BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY BUILDING THE BOX WITH SOME WEAK POINTS ON PURPOSE. THERE'S GONNA BE SO MUCH EXPANDING GAS IN THERE, WE RUN THE RISK OF BREAKING THE SIDES, BUT IF WE PUT IN SOME WEAK POINTS IN OUR JOINTS, WE'LL JUST GET PANEL SEPARATION INSTEAD OF FULL DESTRUCTION. ♪♪ Narrator: ALLIE UNLOADS THE REQUISITE 1 MINUTE AND 47 SECONDS WORTH OF AIR FRESHENER. -THERE WE GO. -AND THEY'RE GOOD TO GO. Allie: OKAY. GOING HOT! Jesse: OVER SPRAYED AIR FRESHENER IN THREE, TWO, ONE. [ EXPLOSION ] THAT WAS PRETTY COOL. -OH, NO. -THAT WAS CRAZY. [ EXPLOSION ] Narrator: JESSE'S WIZARD WENT UP IN SMOKE. -WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR WIZARD? -OH, THE WIZARD. -NO! -HE'S GONE. -AW. -OH, MAN. THAT IS A WEIRD-LOOKING WIZARD. Narrator: IT MAY BE SMALL-SCALE, BUT THIS IS A BIG RESULT. Valerie: WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK? IT'S LOOKING GREAT FOR THE MYTH SO FAR. I MEAN, IF THIS REPRESENTED A FULL CAN OF AIR FRESHENER IN A REAL CAR, THEN THAT CAR IS GOING TO BLOW UP. Narrator: BUT THIS MYTH HAS A SECOND SCENARIO WHERE ROBOTICS EXPERT, VALERIE, CAN FINALLY WORK ALONGSIDE A KINDRED MYTHBUSTER SPIRIT...BUSTER. LET'S JUST ASSUME THAT BUSTER PUTS THE AIR FRESHENER IN THE BACK SEAT OF THE CAR, AND THEN SOMETHING GOES ON TOP OF IT, AND IT STARTS LEAKING, RIGHT? Narrator: AND THEN BUSTER LIGHTS UP, BUT COULD A LIGHTER OR THE CIGARETTE ITSELF SET OFF THE AIR FRESHENER? TO TEST THAT, INVENTOR ALLIE HAS TEAMED UP WITH JON TO DESIGN A REMOTE CONTROL LIGHTER. OUR LITTLE RIG HERE IS A SERVO THAT PUSHES DOWN ON THIS LIGHTER AND GETS US A NICE OPEN FLAME. THIS IS GROSS. I'M DOING IT FOR SCIENCE. Narrator: AND THAT'S THE IDEAL MOMENT FOR A BRIEF MYTHBUSTERS PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT. REMEMBER, KIDS, SMOKING KILLED THE DINOSAURS. DON'T LET IT HAPPEN TO YOU. Narrator: THOSE WITH A VERY LONG MEMORY MIGHT RECALL THIS IS NOT BUSTER'S FIRST CIGARETTE. I THINK WE SHOULD CALL HIM BUSTER. Narrator: BUSTER'S SERIES ONE DEBUT WAS THE EXPLODING TOILET MYTH, WHERE JAMIE AND ADAM TRIED TO FIND OUT IF A LIT CIGARETTE DROPPED IN A TOILET FULL OF BUG SPRAY WOULD EXPLODE. GO. NOTHING. Narrator: IT DIDN'T UNTIL THEY REPLACED THE BUG SPRAY WITH GUN POWDER. GO. [ EXPLOSION ] -WHOO! [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: THE RESULT WAS TWO BUSTED CANS. YEAH, I'VE HAD DAYS JUST LIKE THIS, TOO. Narrator: OVER THE YEARS, HE'S BEEN DROPPED... [ LAUGHS ] POOR GUY. Narrator: ...SPUN... Man: HOW YOU FEELING, BUDDY? Narrator: ...SMASHED... ...SHOT... ...FLUNG... ...AND PULVERIZED... [ EXPLOSIONS ] [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: ...TO FURTHER THE CAUSE OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. THAT IS A HEADACHE. NICE WORK, BUSTER. NICE WORK. [ GLASS SHATTERS ] Narrator: AS BUSTER RESUMES HIS BAD HABIT, ALLIE LETS LOOSE WITH THE SCENT, WHICH SHE'S RIGGED UP TO AUTO-SPRAY. Allie: OKAY, SPRAY IS IN. ALL RIGHT. LIGHTER'S IN PLACE. OKAY, THIS IS LEAKY CAN WITH YOUR AVERAGE LIGHTER IN THREE, TWO, ONE. Narrator: IT'S A HEALTHY FLAME, BUT NO INSTANT COMBUSTION. -NOTHING? -NOPE. JUST SMELLS BAD. -YEAH. -[ LAUGHS ] Narrator: TO MAKE BUSTER SMOKE, VALERIE WORKS A SMALL PUMP THAT DRAWS AIR THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS HEAD. HALF A MINUTE IN, AND IT'S LOOKING LIKE BUSTER'S GOT SMOKER'S COUGH. -[ GASPS ] -HE SPIT IT OUT. EVEN BUSTER DOESN'T LIKE CIGARETTES. EVEN BUSTER DOESN'T LIKE SMOKING. Narrator: BUT THIS TEST IS STILL LIVE WITH A VOLATILE MIX OF OXYGEN, FUEL, AND AN IGNITION SOURCE. Valerie: IT WAS PRETTY NERVE-RACKING. WE WERE BEHIND BLAST PANELS. WE HAD OUR HELMETS ON. WE HAD EYE PROTECTION. YOU KNOW, WE WERE NOT KIDDING AROUND WITH THIS THING. ♪♪ Narrator: TO BUST OR CONFIRM THE MYTH THAT A DOG CAN SHED 70% OF ITS WATER WEIGHT IN JUST ONE SHAKE... THAT WAS ALL UP IN MY FACE. Narrator: ...THE MYTHBUSTERS KNOW THEY'LL NEED MORE THAN ONE TEST POOCH. SO THEY'VE SENT OUT A CANINE CASTING CALL. COME HERE, TIPI. COME ON. AW, TIPI. -NOW I WANT A DOG. -[ LAUGHS ] SENIOR DESIGN CONSULTANT, TAMARA, IS ON-HAND TO ADVISE AND ASSIST. A "MYTHBUSTERS" VETERAN, SEARCH FINALIST, AND ELITE ALL-AROUND ENGINEER AND MAKER, SHE'S BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN CHOOSING TODAY'S TEST DOGS. WE HAVE A SAMPLING OF SMALL, MEDIUM, AND LARGE DOGS, LOOKING AT BOTH LONG-HAIR AND SHORT-HAIR BREEDS, SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT ALL THE VARIABLES AND TRY TO GET TO OUR 70% WEIGHT LOSS WITH SHAKE. YOU READY? Narrator: AS BEFORE, THEY BEGIN WITH A DRY WEIGH-IN, WHICH IS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY TO MEET OUR SIX DISTINCTIVE VOLUNTEERS. THERE'S RILEY, TIPI, DAZZLE, CODA-BEAR, DANI, AND WILLIE. -HERE'S TIPI. -TIPI, HELLO. -HOW ARE YOU TODAY? -HI. Narrator: THE FIRST PUP TO HIT THE H2O IS TIPI, A SMALL DOG WITH SHORT HAIR. IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG TO GET HER THOROUGHLY SOAKED. INCOMING TIPI. Narrator: AND UPCOMING CRITICAL MOMENT, GETTING HER WET WEIGHT BEFORE SHE SHAKES. Elijah: 15.2. OH, AND THERE GOES THE SHAKE. Narrator: SO IT'S OFF TO A HIGH SPEED THAT'S JUST AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY EXPLOSION AND FAR MORE FETCHING. TIPI'S SHAKE STARTS AT THE HEAD AND WORKS DOWN TO THE TIP OF HER TAIL. THE OPPOSING BUT COMPLEMENTARY GYRATIONS ARE SO BRILLIANTLY EFFICIENT THAT THEY'RE BEING STUDIED IN THE HOPE OF DESIGNING BETTER WASHERS AND DRYERS. AFTER TIPI SHOOK, SHE WEIGHED 14.8 POUND. OKAY. Narrator: THAT'S ALMOST HALF A POUND GONE IN ONE SHAKE. HERE IS DAZZLE. HELLO, DAZZLE. HOW ARE YOU TODAY? HI. YOU'RE GONNA GET A BATH. Narrator: SO LET'S SEE IF DAZZLE CAN DO EVEN BETTER. SHE'S JUST SO SKINNY. Narrator: SHE MORE PETITE THAN HER F.B.B.F.F., ENJOYS LONG WALKS WITH MULTIPLE PIT STOPS AND LIKES TO WEAR HER HAIR LONG. -9.6. -9.6. -YEAH, 9.6 -9.6. Narrator: THEY'VE GOT HER WET WEIGHT, BUT THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF SHAKING GOING ON. HOPEFULLY SHAKE IN THREE, TWO, ONE. -COME ON, DAZZLE, SHAKE. -COME ON, SHAKE. SHAKE. SHAKE, DAZZLE. -THERE IT IS. -YAY! 8.5. Narrator: THAT'S BETTER. BOTH OF THESE SMALL DOGS HAVE ACTUALLY SURPASSED THE MYTHICAL 70% SHAKE-OFF, DAZZLE WITH 73.3% AND TIPI WITH 83.5%. BUT HOW WILL THE BIGGER DOGS FAIR? ALL THEY KNOW FOR CERTAIN IS THAT GETTING THOSE PLUS-SIZED PETS WET WILL BE NO WALK IN THE PARK. TAMARA IS MORE WET THAN THE DOG. ♪♪ Narrator: TESTING THE MYTH THAT A CAR FULL OF AIR FRESHENER COULD BE COMBUSTIBLE, ALLIE, JESSE, AND VALERIE GOT A BIG SMALL-SCALE RESULT USING A SPARK FOR IGNITION. THAT WAS PRETTY COOL. Narrator: NOW THEY'VE MOVED ON TO THE SECOND SCENARIO, A SLOWLY LEAKING CAN WITH A LIT CIGARETTE. Allie: EVEN BUSTER DOESN'T LIKE CIGARETTES. Narrator: THEY'VE BEEN WATCHING AND WAITING FOR ALMOST TWO MINUTES AND THAT'S LONG ENOUGH. -THAT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL. -MNH-MNH. BUT WE DO KNOW OUR AIR FRESHENER IS FLAMMABLE. Narrator: THE RATIO OF AIR TO FUEL IS CRUCIAL FOR COMBUSTION. WORKING ON THE PREMISE THAT THEY DIDN'T LEAK ENOUGH AIR FRESHENER, THIS TIME THEY START THE SPRAY A FULL MINUTE BEFORE IGNITION. LIGHTING IN THREE, TWO, ONE. [ OBJECT WHIRS ] Narrator: THE LIGHTER IS WORKING, BUT SO FAR NO BOOM. WELL, MAYBE IT'S TOO WET IN THERE. MAYBE IT'S TRYING TO COME ON, BUT SINCE IT'S SO WET, THEN IT'S NOT ABLE TO. I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP TRYING AND EVERY FIVE SECONDS TRY IT AGAIN, JUST TO SEE IF IT WILL DRY UP AND EXPLODE. -THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. -SOUNDS GOOD. Narrator: BY LETTING THE SPRAY DISPERSE AND SETTLE, THEY'RE HOPING TO DIAL IN THE PERFECT EXPLOSIVE RATIO OF FUEL TO AIR. AND JUST A FEW CLICKS LATER... -OH, MY GOD! -OH, MY GOODNESS! -JEEZ! -WHOA! THAT WAS OUT OF NOWHERE! OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. -OH, I FELT IT. -OH. THAT WAS SO AWESOME. I WAS LITERALLY JUST ABOUT TO SAY, "IT'S NOT WORKING." Narrator: IT'S A SAFE BET THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT VALERIE WAS THINKING, TOO. BOOM, THE TOP FLIES OFF, AND VALERIE IS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, MY HEART." I THINK IT SCARED HER. YOU WOULD STARE AT IT FOR, LIKE, 10 SECONDS, AND YOU'D LOOK AWAY, AND AT THAT EXACT MOMENT, IT WOULD EXPLODE. MORAL OF THE STORY? DON'T EVER TURN YOUR BACK ON SCIENCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S AN EXPLOSION. -THAT'S SO PRETTY. -OH, MY GOD. Jesse: LOOK AT THE LID. OH, MY GOD, AND RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN MY HEART DROPPED. YEAH. RIGHT THERE WAS WHEN I HAD A HEART ATTACK. WAH. ♪♪ Narrator: AS BOTH THE SPARK AND THE CIGARETTE SCENARIOS WORKED, IT'S AGREED THEY CAN NOW REGARD THIS AS ONE SIMPLE MYTH. AEROSOL SPRAY PLUS GENERIC IGNITION EQUALS ONE ALMIGHTY BANG. -OH, MY GOD. -OH, MY GOODNESS. Narrator: BUT GOING FULL-SCALE MIGHT NOT PROVE QUITE SO SIMPLE. ONE THING WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT OUR BOX ISN'T A CAR. A CAR HAS STEEL AND HAS A LOT MORE VOLUME THAN OUR ACRYLIC BOX DOES, SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS GO TO THE BOMB RANGE... -OH, MY GOD. -I'M SORRY, BUSTER. ...FILL UP OUR CAR... [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] THE AREA AND GET BACK TO BACK TO BASE. ...AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET A BOOM OUT OF IT. SPARKING IN THREE, TWO, ONE. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Narrator: PINT-SIZED DAZZLE AND TIPI HAVE ALREADY DONE THEIR BIT TO SEE IF A SOGGY DOG CAN SHED 70% OF ITS WATER WEIGHT WITH ONE GOOD SHAKE. NOW THEY'RE BRINGING IN THE BIG GUNS. HERE'S DANI. Narrator: AT 102 POUNDS, SHORT-HAIRED DANI IS CONSIDERABLY HEAVIER THAN SOME OF THE YOUNGER MYTHBUSTERS AND TAMARA. SO THIS TIME, IT'S A REAL TEAM EFFORT. GOOD GIRL. PROJECT DANI COMING IN. Narrator: LIKE THE OTHERS, SHE'S WEIGH PRE... 104.1. Narrator: ...AND POST SHAKE. THE NEAT THING ABOUT THE HIGH SPEED SHOTS IS THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT EVEN THOUGH THE DOGS HEADS ARE ONLY REALLY TILTING FROM, SAY, A ONE TO AN 11 ON A CLOCK, THEIR SKIN IS GOING FULL THREE TO 9:00, SO YOU'RE GETTING THIS AWESOME SPIRAL OF WATER EVERY TIME THEY'RE SHAKING. WATCHING THE DOGS ON HIGH SPEED WHEN THEY SHOOK, THE MAIN THING THAT SURPRISED ME WAS HOW MUCH SALIVA THEY GOT OUT WHEN THEY SHOOK. IT WAS THE MOST DISGUSTING THING I'VE EVER SEEN. ♪♪ Narrator: OUR NEXT HAIRY HEAVYWEIGHT IS WET WILLIE. -102.5, I THINK. -I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT. -YEAH, 102.5. WRITE THAT DOWN. -102.5, OKAY. Narrator: AND THEN DUCK FOR COVER. [ LAUGHS ] AWESOME. Narrator: BOTH ADAM AND CANNAN TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM. I WAS GLAD I HAD THE SWIMMING TRUNKS ON BECAUSE THAT HELPED AS FAR AS NOT GETTING MY ACTUAL WARDROBE WET. Narrator: DANI'S PERCENTAGE OF WATER WEIGHT LOST IS JUST 42, AND WILLIE'S IS EVEN LESS, BOTH WELL SHORT OF THE EARLIER RESULTS AND THE MYTHICAL 70%. CONFIRMING OR BUSTING THE MYTH STILL HANGS IN THE BALANCE, AND IT'S GONNA COME DOWN TO OUR FINAL TWO MIDDLEWEIGHTS. ONLY ONE THING IS ASSURED, IT WON'T BE PRETTY. HIS LIPS, THAT'S THE MOST ATTRACTIVE THING I'VE SEEN ALL DAY. ♪♪ Narrator: AFTER PROVING THE DESTRUCTIVE POTENTIAL OF BUTANE PROPELLANT AIR FRESHENERS, IT'S TIME TO TAKE THIS VOLATILE MYTH ON THE ROAD. FOR VALERIE, ALLIE, AND JESSE, IT'S THE ULTIMATE FIELD TRIP. -IN THREE... -TWO. ONE. Narrator: THE ALAMEDA COUNTY BOMB RANGE WAS THE SITE OF CHOICE FOR SOME OF ADAM AND JAMIE'S MORE EXUBERANT MYTHS. ♪ FIRE IN THE HOLE, FIRE IN THE HOLE ♪ ♪ FIRE IN THE HOLE ♪ Narrator: IF YOU'RE INTO BLOWING STUFF TO BITS, THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS. BUH-BYE. [ EXPLOSION ] Narrator: AND IT WASN'T ALL JUST FUN AND GAMES. IN SERIES EIGHT, THE GUYS SET OUT TO SEE IF AN ATTEMPT ON HITLER'S LIFE WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IF THE BOMB WENT OFF IN A BUNKER INSTEAD OF A REGULAR ROOM. [ EXPLOSION ] -WHOA! -BOOM. Narrator: THEY DECIDED IT WASN'T THE ROOM THAT MATTERED, BUT HOW CLOSE TO BOMB WAS TO THE FUHRER. HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF DAMAGE FROM SPLINTERS IN HIS LOWER HALF, BUT HIS HEAD, COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED. Narrator: SO THE VALKYRIE MYTH WAS BUSTED. THE BOMB RANGE WAS REALLY COOL BECAUSE IT WAS BASICALLY WALKING THROUGH A "MYTHBUSTERS" MUSEUM. IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE. Narrator: BUT REST ASSURED, THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF RESPONSIBLE ADULT SUPERVISION. ♪♪ ALL RIGHT, GOING FULL SIZE AT THE BOMB RANGE. TELL ME WHAT YOU GUYS LEARNED IN YOUR SCALE EXPERIMENTS. BOTTOM LINE, THIS STUFF SMELLS REALLY GOOD, AND IT'S FLAMMABLE. IDEAL. ALSO, WHEN IT COMES TO THE CIGARETTE TEST VERSUS THE SPARK TEST, THE SPARK TEST IS A LOT MORE PREDICTABLE, AND IT STILL HAS A GREAT EXPLOSION. FABULOUS. WELL, FOR BIG-SCALE STUFF LIKE THIS, RELIABILITY EQUALS SAFETY, SO YOU GUYS ARE HAPPY TO BE GOING WITH THE SPARK FOR ALL THE TESTS? -YEAH. -YEP. Narrator: TO GENERATE THE SPARK, THEY'RE STICKING WITH THE EVER RELIABLE NEON TRANSFORMER. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET BUSTER IN THE CAR. Narrator: FOR FULL-SCALE TESTING, BUSTER GETS HIS FULL SCALE BODY BACK. -OH, MY GOD. -I'M SORRY, BUSTER. -YOU HAVE HIS LEGS BACKWARDS. -I KNOW. Narrator: AND RIGHT NOW, HE'S WISHING HE LEFT IT IN STORAGE. POOR BUSTER! -MAN, I DON'T -- -WHY'D YOU DO THAT? I'M TRYING TO GET HIM IN THE CAR. Narrator: IT'S NOT QUITE THE RECOMMENDED DRIVING POSTURE, BUT HEY, SO LONG AS HE'S COMFORTABLE. CLOSE THE DOOR. THERE, PERFECT. WE DID IT. IT IS ALMOST TIME TO FILL THIS CAR WITH SOME DELIGHTFUL, YET FLAMMABLE AIR FRESHENER, BUT FIRST, I'M GONNA GET DRESSED FOR THE OCCASION. YOU CAN'T SMELL THIS GEAR, BUT I TELL YOU, IT SMELLS LIKE FIRE AND FIRE RETARDANT MATERIAL. IT JUST...[ INHALES DEEPLY, EXHALES SLOWLY ] IT'S SUCH A GOOD MEMORY SMELL FOR ME. HERE WE GO.

Narrator: SOME SPRAY-ON BRANDS WORK, SO THAT MYTH WAS PLAUSIBLE. Adam: HEY, WE CAUGHT HIM ON FIRE. Narrator: THEY TESTED THE MOVIE MYTH OF A LIT GASOLINE TRAIL CATCHING UP TO AND EXPLODING A CAR... Adam: BE CAREFUL, YOU GUYS, NOT TOO CLOSE. Narrator: ...WHICH WAS TOTALLY BUSTED. Adam: FOR A REAL WORLD CONTROL, THAT TEST WENT ABOUT AS GOOD AS I COULD HAVE HOPED. Narrator: AND THE SUIT CAME IN FOR A SERIOUS SCORCHING WHEN JAMIE AND ADAM PITTED A CO2 FIRE EXTINGUISHER AGAINST A FLAMETHROWER. ALL OF THIS SHOULD KEEP ME PERFECTLY SAFE. ♪♪ I LIVED! HOLY [BLEEP]! THAT WAS AWESOME. Narrator: WHILE ADAM DISCHARGES THE CAN'S CONTENTS, HIS CORE TEMPERATURE INSIDE THAT SUIT RAPIDLY RISES. FORTUNATELY, HE CAN BE REPLACED BY SOME HEAVY-DUTY TAPE TO HOLD DOWN THE NOZZLE. SAFETY IS SAFETY. IF THIS TAKES 14 MINUTES TO UNLOAD, AND I'M STANDING HERE WITHOUT MOVING, I COULD GET HEAT STROKE, AND IT'S NO GOOD IF I'M PASSED OUT NEXT TO A CAR THAT'S ABOUT TO EXPLODE.

Narrator: LAST OF ALL IS RILEY, WHO'S JUST ITCHING TO SHAKE OFF THOSE EXCESS POUNDS. 91.6 POUNDS. 91.6. Narrator: ONCE AGAIN, IT'S POETRY IN MOTION, ESPECIALLY ON THE HIGH SPEED. RILEY DOES NOT LOOK GREAT WHEN SHAKING. Rachel: THOSE LIPS, THOUGH, THAT'S THE MOST ATTRACTIVE THING I'VE SEEN ALL DAY. Narrator: BUT DID OUR MID-SIZED DOGS DO ENOUGH TO RESCUE THE MYTH? RILEY'S RESULT WAS WELL ABOVE 70, BUT CODA'S FELL WAY SHORT. WET DOGS, I HAVE THE LIST OF ALL OF THE AVERAGE WATER WEIGHTS THAT EACH OF OUR TEST SUBJECTS WAS ABLE TO SHED. RILEY WAS NUMBER ONE AT 87.5%. TIPI FOLLOWED CLOSELY AT 83.5%. DAZZLE, 73 AND CHANGE. CODA-BEAR, 49%. DANI, 42%. WILLIE, 41.6%. AND THE AVERAGE OF ALL OF THOSE AVERAGES IS? ABOUT 63%. Narrator: SURPRISINGLY, THE RESULTS BARE NO OBVIOUS RELATION TO SIZE OR LENGTH OF HAIR. WHAT'S LESS SURPRISING IS THAT TODAY'S BEST IN SHOW IS RILEY, THE LAB RETRIEVER, THE ONLY ONE OF THE BUNCH WITH WATER DOG DNA. ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK? IS THAT BUSTED, PLAUSIBLE, OR CONFIRMED? THE MYTH SAYS 70%. I THINK 63% IS CLOSE ENOUGH. I THINK WE CAN CALL THIS PLAUSIBLE. I AGREE, IT'S PLAUSIBLE. I MEAN, WE HAD NUMBERS ABOVE IT AND BELOW IT SO. -I AGREE. -I AGREE, PLAUSIBLE. I TOTALLY AGREE. I THINK IT'S PLAUSIBLE AS WELL. EXCELLENT WORK, GUYS. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M GONNA GO WALK MY DOGS. -BYE. -OKAY, THEN. ♪♪ Narrator: AFTER OVERCOMING SOME PRE-IGNITION NERVES... -FLIP THE SWITCH. -AH! -YOU ALL RIGHT? -HUH! Narrator: ...THE TEAM IS ALL SET TO TEST THE FULL-SCALE MYTH OF EXPLODING AIR FRESHENER. FULL CAN LEAKED INTO CAR. SPARKING IN THREE, TWO, ONE... ♪♪ Narrator: NOTHING. IT'S POSSIBLE THERE WAS NO SPARK, BUT THAT'S EASY TO CHECK. I SEE THE SPARK. NOTHING. OKAY, GO AHEAD AND -- -WOW, REALLY? -...PULL YOUR HAND BACK. THAT WAS ANTI-CLIMACTIC. Narrator: JUST LIKE IN THE SMALL-SCALE CIGARETTE TEST, THE PROBLEM IS MOST LIKELY THE RATIO OF SPRAY TO OXYGEN. SO AGAIN, THEY DECIDE TO GIVE THE AIR FRESHENER TIME TO DISPERSE. ALL RIGHT. IT'S BEEN ABOUT 90 SECONDS SINCE THE FIRST BLAST ATTEMPT. -OKAY. -CALL IT IN. ALL RIGHT, FULL CAN OF AIR FRESHENER LEAKED INTO CAR. -BRILLIANT. -ALL RIGHT. SPARKING IN THREE, TWO, ONE. [ ELECTRICITY BUZZING ] NOTHING. -NADA. -DARN IT. Narrator: BUT THEY'VE COME TOO FAR TO GIVE UP NOW. -YOU GUYS WANT TO TRY AGAIN? -YES. Narrator: SO 30 SECONDS LATER... Jesse: FULL CAN OF AIR FRESHENER IN CAR. THIRD TIME. ZAPPING IN THREE, TWO, ONE. [ ELECTRICITY BUZZING ] IT'S ZAPPING. IT'S ZAPPING. WHY! Narrator: THAT'S REALLY THE BURNING QUESTION, AND IT WON'T BE TOO LONG BEFORE THEY GET A FITTINGLY FLAMMABLE ANSWER. Jesse: WHOA, IT'S ON FIRE. -WHAT? -IT'S ON FIRE. REALLY? ♪♪ IN THREE, TWO, ONE. Narrator: AFTER THREE FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO CONFIRM THE MYTH OF EXPLOSIVE AIR FRESHENER... Adam: I SEE THE SPARK. NOTHING. Narrator: ...IT'S PROVING TO BE AN UNUSUALLY QUIET DAY ON THE BOMB RANGE. YOU'RE GETTING A VERY, VERY REGULAR MYTHBUSTERS KIND OF DAY HERE. -REALLY? -YEP. THIS IS HOW IT ALWAYS GOES, NEVER QUITE WHAT YOU'D EXPECT. Narrator: AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH BECAUSE ON THEIR NEXT ATTEMPT... SPARKING IN THREE, TWO, ONE. [ ELECTRICITY BUZZING ] NOTHING. NOTHING. -I'VE LOST HOPE. -WHOA, IT'S ON FIRE. -WHAT? -IT'S ON FIRE. REALLY? Narrator: YEAH, REALLY. AND WHAT STARTED OUT AS A FLICKER OF FLAME IS FAST BECOMING A BUSTER BONFIRE. -UH... -WELL. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WERE GOING FOR. YEAH, CAR'S ON FIRE. Narrator: AFTER MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT CONFIRMING THE MYTH OF EXPLODING CAR AIR FRESHENER, THEY'VE AT LEAST GOT SOME KIND OF RESULT. AS ADAM VENTS THE CAR AND TACKLES THE FLAMES, THE MYTHBUSTERS GO TO THE ACTION REPLAY. Jesse: WE HIT THE BUTTON. IT DIDN'T QUITE EXPLODE LIKE WE WERE HOPING, BUT, I MEAN, IT WAS REALLY COOL. THERE WAS THIS BIG OLD BUBBLE OF FLAMES, AND IT JUST SURROUNDED THE CAR AND WENT ALL OVER THE PLACE. Narrator: ADAM'S MANAGED TO SAVE BUSTER'S SKIN. EVEN SO, THERE'S BEEN PLENTY OF DAMAGE DONE. -EW. -WHAT? THE WHOLE SEAT MELTED. IT'S LIKE A S'MORE GONE WRONG. Narrator: ALTHOUGH THEY GOT FIRE, IT SEEMS THAT THEIR RATIO OF REACTANTS OR STOICHIOMETRIC MIX STILL WASN'T QUITE RIGHT. I THINK WE HAD TOO MUCH FUEL AND NOT ENOUGH AIR. THERE WAS A FULL CAN IN HERE. THAT IS A TON OF PROPELLANT. WE FILLED THIS CAR FULL OF AIR FRESHENER, AND THE MIXTURE PROVED TOO RICH FOR ABOUT 40 MINUTES. SO WE'RE GONNA CLEAN THE WINDOWS. WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME PLYWOOD IN THE BACK WINDOW THAT I HAD TO BREAK IN ORDER TO SAFELY APPROACH THE CAR. THEN WE'LL CUT A HOLE IN THAT PLYWOOD FOR ME TO PUT IN THE AIR FRESHENER, AND WE'VE AGREED WE'RE GONNA PUT IN FOUR MINUTES OF SPRAY FROM THE CAN, NOT THE FULL 12 TO 14 MINUTES, AND I THINK THAT SHOULD GIVE US THE RIGHT AIR-FUEL MIXTURE FOR THE BOOM WE'RE LOOKING FOR. [ SPRAY HISSING ] ♪♪ THE RIG IS HOT. WANT TO ARM IT? [ SWITCH CLICKS ] -ALL RIGHT. MAKE SURE WE GET A SPARK, JESSE. SPARKING IN THREE, TWO, ONE. [ ELECTRICITY BUZZING ] WELL, LOOK AT THAT. -NOTHING HAPPENED. -OH, COME ON, VALERIE. I'M SO DONE WITH THIS. THIS IS KILLING ME. THIS IS KILLING ME. THIS IS AWFUL. Narrator: THEY NEED TO REMEMBER THIS ISN'T A FAILURE. IT'S A RESULT. BUT AFTER THE SUCCESS OF THEIR SMALL-SCALE EXPERIMENTS... -OH, MY GOD! -OH, MY GOODNESS! -JEEZ! -WHOA! Narrator: ...IT'S NOT THE RESULT THEY EXPECTED. VALERIE IS ESPECIALLY VEXED THAT THE CAR IS STILL IN ONE PIECE. I'M NOT LEAVING HERE UNTIL WE SEE SOMETHING EXPLODE. Narrator: AND THAT'S A WISH EASILY GRANTED THANKS TO BOMB RANGE SUPERVISOR J.D. NELSON AND A STRATEGICALLY PLACED WATER IMPULSE CHARGE OF C-4. FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE! IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE DONE THAT. -ALL RIGHT, YOU READY? -[ MOUTHS WORDS ] VALERIE, YOU ARE HOLDING ON TO -- I KNOW, IT'S REAL. THIS IS C-4 EXPLOSION IN THREE, TWO, ONE. ♪♪ -DID IT WORK? -I HAVE NO IDEA. I SAW THE SHOCK TUBE WORK. THE CAR DID NOT EXPLODE. [ EXPLOSION ] -WHOA! -WHOA! NO! I DIDN'T GET TO SEE IT! -WOW! -DANG IT! Narrator: ON A DAY WHEN NOT MUCH WENT ACCORDING TO PLAN, THEY WERE ALL LOOKING SOMEWHERE ELSE WHEN THE CAR WENT UP. THE MINOR DETAIL THAT SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS WAS THAT THE DETONATOR WAS ON AN EIGHT-SECOND DELAY. THERE'S ALWAYS THE HIGH SPEED. THAT IS THE MANTRA OF "MYTHBUSTERS." THERE IS ALWAYS THE HIGH SPEED. SAY IT WITH ME. All: "THERE IS ALWAYS THE HIGH SPEED." Narrator: AND THIS IS THE HIGH SPEED. Valerie: OH, MY GOD! HOLY COW! Narrator: THAT BLAST WAS SO POWERFUL THAT BUSTER'S STODGY SEDAN BECAME AN INSTANT CONVERTIBLE, BUT HE'S IN NO CONDITION TO APPRECIATE IT. BUSTER! OH, MY GOODNESS, HIS... OH, MY GOODNESS. -A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR BUSTER. -[ LAUGHS ] Narrator: SO HOW DO THEY WANT TO CALL IT? ALLIE HAS BEEN CHOSEN TO SPEAK FOR THE TEAM. THE MYTH IS YOU CAN CAUSE AN EXPLOSION WITH AIR FRESHENER, AND FROM WHAT WE'VE SAW FROM THE SMALL-SCALE TEST, THAT WAS PRETTY COOL, AND WE GOT A COOL EXPLOSION. WHEN WE TOOK IT TO LARGE-SCALE TESTING, HOWEVER, WE DIDN'T GET THE BOOM WE WANTED, BUT WE STILL GOT THE CAR TO SET ON FIRE, SO I WOULD SAY THIS MYTH IS PLAUSIBLE. ♪♪ Adam: THESE GUYS DID A GREAT JOB ON THIS STORY. LET ME FRAME THEIR RESULTS THIS WAY. IF I'M A CHEMICAL ENGINEER DESIGNING AN AIR FRESHENER USING FLAMMABLE PROPELLANT, I'M GOING TO TRY AND ENGINEER A MIXTURE WITH A VERY NARROW WINDOW WHERE THAT MIXTURE IS FLAMMABLE. THAT'S JUST SAFE DESIGN, AND THE MYTHBUSTERS WERE ABLE TO FIND THAT EXPLOSIVE WINDOW IN SCALE, AND WHILE THE EXPLOSIVE ASPECT OF IT ELUDED THEM IN LARGE SCALE, THEY WERE ABLE TO GET A FIRE, AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM CALLING THIS STORY PLAUSIBLE. FEELS LIKE EXACTLY THE RIGHT INITIATION TO THIS JOB. ♪♪
