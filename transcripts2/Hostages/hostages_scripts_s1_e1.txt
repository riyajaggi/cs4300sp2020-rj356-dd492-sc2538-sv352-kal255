 We have 30 minutes before the neighborhood arrives. The commander has a mess on his hands in his first week on the job. If there's anything he likes, it's debriefings. -Where's the negotiation team? -Orna's the team. Coming from Tel Aviv. -When will she be here? -She was on La Guardia a minute ago. -Is this the vehicle? -Yes. A patrol unit in Hebron Road caught a car thief red-handed. The chase ended here when he abandoned the vehicle. He's in this building, in an apartment on the second floor. When the police approach the door, he says he has a hostage, and if they try to break in, he'll kill him. Okay, guys, keep your eyes open. Let's do this. -Sniper one to Commander. Eye contact? -Negative. -Sniper two? -Negative.

 Rubin, I have information on the kidnapper. Yaniv, 27, released on parole two weeks ago. -Where's Orna? -Stuck in traffic. She'll be here in ten minutes. Should we go in? I'm going in alone. -Alone? Are you crazy? -I'll bring him out. -What's that? -Amsalem, he's a petty thief. If he stole a car, I want him alive. What's up with you, Rubin? It's my last day. I want him alive. -You asshole, I'll report you. -You do that. Just watch my back. Yaniv? My name is Adam Rubin. I'm the officer in charge. I want to come in and talk to you. Don't try it. You come in, I'll slaughter him. Yaniv, let me explain the situation. I have 12 men who are just waiting for my command to go in. I think it's best that you talk to me. Yaniv tell me what you need. I need a vehicle. Okay, I'll get you a vehicle. But I need you to let him go. Think I was born yesterday? If I leave here with you, my ass is going to jail. This isn't my first time. Get me that vehicle now. You can't leave here with him. Get me some wheels or I'll slit his throat! You stole a car. You're not a murderer. Yaniv, alright, alright. I get it, you mean business. Take me. Take me instead. Wouldn't that be better? You're here to fuck me over. You're gonna do that thing with your hands? Here's what I'm going to do. I'll do it slowly. This is my gun. Take me. Good. Go. We're coming out. Amsalem, take it easy. Everyone back. Everyone back. Give us room. I have no clear shot. Keep moving. What are you doing? Keep walking! -Yaniv, it's over. -Keep walking! -I'll shoot you, I swear! I'll shoot him! -Drop the gun! Don't move! Don't move! -Let's go. -Son of a bitch! Do you recognize the anatomy? This is the kidney artery. This is the vein. Suction for Dr. Yanai. Careful. Okay. Nice. Dr. Yanai, which suture would you use? Do you mean what type? What size? Nylon five zeros. Very good. BARAZANI. URGENT. Yanai, finish up for me. Hi, Noa. What's up? -Hi, Mom. Where are you? -At work. How come you have signal? I'm not in the base. I came back. Why? What happened? I wasn't feeling well. I had a stomach ache. Nausea. -Could it be something you ate? -I don't know. In any case, my lift let me off in town. Thought I'd come to the hospital and go home with you. -I have an afternoon shift. -Dr. Danon... I need to talk to you about something. Dr. Danon... Sweetie, this isn't a good time. You go home. Get some rest. I'll call you soon. -Okay, bye. -Bye. -What is it? -Netzer's surgery is pushed to tomorrow. A change in his condition? I'm told it's a scheduling matter. Does Bentzur know? We have 30 minutes to perform tests. The entourage is on its way. -Eldar. How are you? -This was the only time available. -Hello. How are you? -Dr. Danon. -Giora Avni. VIP security. -Nice to meet you. -You've met Bentzur. -Head of the department. This is Avi, head of administration. Ella, unit director. They're here. -Mr. Prime Minister. -Hello, Avner. -Dr. Yael Danon. -Nice to meet you, sir. -You have me for 30 minutes. -I won't keep you, sir. Don't you trust me? We need to talk about this. Do I look like a shrink to you? Prices change. Inflation and all that. Cut the crap. This is what we agreed on. Take the money and get your scrawny ass out of here before I really get mad. You know, I gave it a lot of thought. What kind of person buys four guns? What? If you bought 20 pieces, I'd say you're going to sell them. One means you might be thinking of taking someone out. But four? It's for a job, right? Something special. Listen, I know about these things. Help me out with some money. Give me some more cash and I'll forget all about you. I'll keep my mouth shut. How much? Five grand. -Five grand? -Yeah. It's nothing personal. It's business. What do you take me for? I'll finish you off without batting an eye. It was an accident. He left class. He couldn't stop because of the stopping distance. The stopping distance? Nice. You're talking the law of physics, Lior. Not your better subject, I might add. -The skateboards stay here. -Why? What good will that do? You're right, Lior. I doubt that'll do any good. But maybe if you walk for a few days, some good will come of it after all. Let's try it, okay? Go on. Get back to class. Assaf, hold on. Is that the skateboard Mom and I bought you? No, it's new. I lost the other one. Assaf... Listen, I heard a rumor that a copy of the final exam is being distributed online. -Do you know anything about it? -No. -If you hear anything, let me know. -Of course. Some of the 12th graders have done too well recently. -What's that got to do with me? -Nothing. It has to do with Lior. The police is getting involved, so if you hear anything, don't be a hero, but come to me. AVI LERNER -Is everything alright? -Yes. Go on. See you at home, son. AVI LERNER: I HOPE YOU'RE NOT IGNORING ME -He chewed my ear off. -What did he want? Don't freak out, but someone may be after us. Like who? They want the police to investigate the exam thing. -Shit. -Those stupid 12th graders. I told them not to raise the average so much. -We've gotta ditch the whole thing. -What, are you a pussy now? If I get in trouble again, my dad will ship my ass off to boarding school. I promised the exam to Mia. Forget Mia. The police are involved. It's a criminal offense. We've gotta stop now. -Okay, you got the new phone? -Yes. Don't lose it this time. Criminal offense? May I? Is this how it's going to be now? I guess so. I don't get it. You knew I was assigned to this surgery even before I did. What...? Yael, when you want something, you know how to get it. He's a big boy. He'll be fine. I don't understand. Am I supposed to tell him that they don't think he's fit enough? That they're afraid to let him hold a knife over the Prime Minister? He knows very well why they chose you. It's just convenient for him to take his anger out on you. He'll get over it. Believe me. Hi, this is Noa. Leave a message. Hi, sweetie. It's Mom. I wanted to know how you feel, but... Okay, I'll try again later. Bye. DR. YAEL DANON PREGNANCY TEST Oh, my God. How annoying. Yes? -I'm from the cable TV company. -My parents aren't home. We got some calls. There's a local malfunction. How's your reception? Is everything okay? I haven't watched TV today. Sorry. Can I come in for a second? I'll fix it, and be on my way. This isn't a good time. Your mom will be happy. Early prevention. -I don't think she'll notice. -Hold on. Nissan. I'm at 31 Marganit Street. They won't let me in either. What can I do? It's not my day. -Nissan. -Okay. Come on in. Do what you have to do. I've got this. Thanks. You're a real lifesaver. Don't worry. I'll be real quick. -Nice place you got here. -The box is under the TV. Quiet, Ronaldo. What a beautiful dog. He takes his job seriously. No, I think he just hates strangers. I don't know where he got it from. Not from you, that's for sure. Okay, I... I was going to offer you a glass of water, but you're the first person who's made me smile today, so there's Coke in the fridge. Awesome, thanks. This will take a few minutes. You can go back to what you were doing. I'm not sure I want to. I hear you. I'm having a tough week too. I'd love to transport myself into next week. Totally. -Okay, I'll get you that Coke. -Cool. Assaf. -What's up, Prometheus? -Hi, Mia. What's going on? You said you'd send it to me yesterday. I got into some trouble, so I have to lay low for the time being. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. You'll help me with the grammar exam and I'll help you. I'll see what I can do. I'm counting on you, Assaf. Three, four, five, six. Hello? The amount we agreed on is in the envelope in your hand. Under no circumstances are you to open the second envelope. -Is that clear? -Clear. You do your part and don't open the envelope. How do you want...? -Where are you off to? -Ronaldo ran away. That dog knows what's good for him. Ronaldo! Where is that dumb dog? Hurry up! Dinner's almost ready. Noa, dinner in five minutes! I'm not hungry. -Noa, can I come in? -No, I'm getting dressed. -I hear you have a stomach ache. -I'm fine, Dad. Don't worry. Did you eat too much roast beef again? Dad, I need a minute to myself, okay? Okay, sweetheart. I'll save you some pasta. Thanks. Ronaldo? Huh, Mom. "Huh, Mom?" -How are you, Mom? -That's better. I'm doing great. What are you doing outside? I have tons of shopping bags. Come help your old mom. My old mom? Since when is 24 old? You smooth talker. Are you coming? -What are you doing outside? -I can't find Ronaldo. He must be with Rappaport's dog. At least one of us is having a good time. Mom... that's disgusting. Watch the wine. Did I ever tell you how babies are born? Stop it. -You know what a stork is? -Stop it, stop it. Well, on warm nights... -Hey. -Hey. Did you get the cheese? -Hey! How are you doing? -Just fine. -What's up? -What's up? Your garden is great. Tomorrow you'll be drinking your coffee out there. -My Coke. -Your Coke. -Yes, I got the cheese. -Great. -Pasta again. -You see what I have to put up with? It's like saying that caviar and roe are one and the same. Caviar and roe are worlds apart. -He wanted to go to the movies. -So? He was in my office again today with that Lior kid. So I told him that tonight he's hanging out with the family. -I'm off, Danon. -Aren't you staying for dinner? No, I have to go by the warehouse. I still have a few things to do. Hold on. Checks. -Are we good? -Yes, I'll come tomorrow to get my gear. If you need to get into the house, the spare key is under the troll in the garden. -Great. Don't blow it this time. -Don't worry. Everything's cool. Bye, people, see you around. -Bye. Say hello to everyone at home. -Will do. -No, no, no. The oven is on. -Right. The electrician said he'd be here on Thursday. -How's Noa? -Fine. She's not hungry. She's in her room. You can go up there. How are you? Kind of sick of being the bad cop. I'll talk to him. It's piping hot! -It's happening tomorrow. -What's happening? Netzer's operation. -Did you hear what I said? -Really? -Tomorrow? -Yes. -How do you feel? -It's not a complicated operation. -Are you nervous? -I'm ready. That's great. I think it's exciting. I'm going to take a shower. Keep an eye on the pasta. Should I open a bottle of wine? BANK FORECLOSURE NOTICE I'm waiting for you to have dinner. MIA: HEY. YOU THERE? WHO WANTS TO KNOW? MIA: YOU'VE FORGOTTEN ME ALREADY? HOW CAN I FORGET SOMEONE I DON'T KNOW? MIA: FUNNY. SHOULD I REMIND YOU? I REMEMBER. I'M WORKING ON IT. MIA: HURRY. YOU WON'T REGRET IT. Ronaldo! Ronaldo! Ronaldo? Yael, are you in there? I'm not going to repeat myself, so listen up. We're here for a very specific reason. As soon as we get what we want, we'll leave. So don't try to be heroes and don't test us. We don't want to harm you, but if you get in the way of me and my goal, you will be hurt. I'm going to take the duct tape off your mouths. No shouting. Show me that you understand. Let my wife and children go. They won't talk to anyone, not as long as you have me. -That's not the plan. -What do you want? I've said all I'm going to say. Now I'm going to untie your hands. Then Yael and I have to talk. Sit down, Yael. How much do you love your family? I don't think you'll know until you're put to the test. Tomorrow morning you will operate on Shmuel Netzer. He won't survive. What do you mean? I mean that if you want to see your children grow up... if you want to dance at their wedding... see them have families... Shmuel Netzer will die tomorrow. Go back to your family.
