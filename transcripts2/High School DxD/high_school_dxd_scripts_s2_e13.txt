So the rumours we were told are true. There actually is a monster that attacks people at night, and steals their underwear. On behalf of the Gremory family, I will destroy you! Are you all right, Asia?

 Yes. B-But my underwear is missing! What!? It's got my panties! {\move(640,678,640,620,1800,2050)}Hey you! Give back Asia's bra and panties right now! Boost! Let's take down this monster. Everyone, assemble. Understood. Very well. President, be careful of that beam! President! My, my, you can't just run away now. Our information was correct,  the monster is targeting our underwear. Everyone, be careful. C'mon, let's go! Boost! Let's do this! Let's begin. E-Everyone, he's got my favourite underwear! My, my, if that's the case then we can't just attack recklessly. Then what do we do? Again? Tentacles? Asia! Issei-san! My, my. What? I'm the only one left? Don't do anything reckless, Issei! President, leave this to me. Boost! I-Incredible! Taken down in one hit! That technique... So the information was correct after all. Excalibur Mimic! It's been a while. Well, not really. Hello members of the Gremory household. Irina? {\q2}I assume you didn't come here just to see us again, right? {\org(64738,678)\pos(640,678)\frz0.028\t(900,983,1.25,\frz0.034)\t(983,1191,1.25,\frz-0.006)\t(1191,1358,1,\frz0.003)\t(1358,1483,1,\frz0)}Have you been investigating that monster also? That's correct. However, my actual target is the person who's been controlling it. He's known as the Legendary Sage. I've also heard of him. {\q3}The church has sought after the Legendary Sage for many years. Is that the reason why you've been trying to locate him? Well, yes. Not to mention I get to see the town I grew up in. But if we are referring to a Legendary Sage, why would he resort to stealing underwear? Well, that's the reason why I was given an arrest warrant for him. Nevertheless, you've been dispatched to catch a panty thief. I guess there's not much else to do in the church. No! That can't be true. Right, Irina? Eh? Right! If it isn't true, then what's the real reason for the church sending someone of your calibre? Th-The reason is... Anyway, he's an enemy that must be defeated! President, Gasper-kun has found traces of magic. Oh! At last, I found my underwear! Oh no, they're ruined! Ah, this place. It's strangely quiet. There's no one here. Over here, this door has a magic seal. This is the one, right? I'll stand guard up here. Just in case something should appear later. Asia and Yuuto, you stay here also. Yes! These are no good. Why would anyone wear something so cheap? These are beautiful. Is he the Legendary Sage? Yeah, there's no mistaking it. What's with all the stolen underwear? Is he just collecting them? I doubt he's just collecting them. He may be using them as ingredients for some kind of magic. Alchemy? Whoa! Now these are truly a wonderful pair! Ah! They're... What? Is something wrong? Oh, it's nothing! Aren't they yours, Irina? H-He's collected a lot of underwear. Just how many women did he embarrass to have collected so many? That's right. So we cannot allow him to continue doing this any longer. That's quite the collection you've got there, Underwear Thief. Or should I say, Legendary Sage. I see, so you're the ones who killed my monster. What do you want now? {\q0}Perhaps you would like to donate your lingerie for my experiment? You must be joking. {\q0}You dare to do as you please in the region of Rias Gremory? I'm going to beat you to a pulp for what you've done. {\q0}I've been given an arrest warrant for you from the church. I'll give you a lesson with this Excalibur sword. Come on! Oh, my, this is a good combination. This reminds me of the times when we used to fight together. That's right! The Excalibur Sword, huh? Save that speech about your toys for someone else. I used to be a man of the church, you know. Is that right? Yes, it's true. When I was young, I used to think that believing in God was everything. Suppressing my desires, I served the church. {\fad(0,750)}I believed it was best to have unconditional love and faith in God. But, one day, I accidentally touched an object, so soft and supple. Boobs! From that day on, my life changed. I wondered why God would forbid one from something so beautiful? For what reason was I not allowed to fondle those boobs? Why didn't anyone tell me about these magnificent things before? And then, when I could no longer bear the pain of it all... Oh god of ero, show me! It's all right to caress the boobs. It's all right to take their panties. Oh, my lord! Thanks to the ero god, I started experimenting. {\q0}Despite all the insults and threats I received, I didn't once stop. For this is my magnum opus! All of this was possible because of what the god of ero had taught me! It's all right, you can squeeze them. {\q0}It's all right to take the panties and wear them on your head. Are you done with your story? You! You're not alone, I understand that all to well! Jeez. I've finally met another who can show me new, obscene ways of ero! Issei-senpai, that's great! Gya-kun, don't take him seriously. So you mean to say, you can understand my loneliness and the truth of what I really mean? I do! I, too, have a skill that others do not appreciate. {\ko169}It's called, {\ko98}Dress Break! I can tear off women's clothing just by touching them, it is a skill that is fuelled by the hopes and dreams of men! Pathetic! What? Koneko-chan! I'm okay. But that's a despicable ability. No way! He didn't even touch her! This is just child's play. That red-haired woman. {\move(640,678,640,620,1900,2150)}Oh! Her underwear is a purple-ish colour! What!? And that blue-haired woman. She's wearing mismatched colours. Even if you're in a hurry, you should take the time to match your apparel. H-How do you know? And underneath that church's knight's armour... Who, me!? What's this!? You aren't wearing any underwear! What!? This battle armour is supposed to be worn without any underwear! I always wear underwear otherwise! Do you understand now? I don't need to touch them to tear their clothes off. I've even acquired the ability to see through their clothes. Your ability is nothing compared to any of the abilities that I have pioneered. It cannot be... The power that I struggled hard to attain, my Dress Break, is insignificant!? Issei-senpai! Indeed, it's true that I'm weak! But, I'm still developing it. I can make it grow more powerful and useful! That's right, you're just using your strength alone. But, I will defeat you with my spirit! Is there nothing we can do with you, Issei? Well, his spirit is what makes him stronger. Azazel-sensei! Why are you here? Because that man is my target too. I will be observing until the end of the experiment. I can't believe you're interested in such experiments. This man is the one who is closest to creating the Philosopher's Stone. The Philosopher's Stone? {\fad(0,1000)}No one has been able to get this close to achieving the Philosopher's Stone before. It's highly likely that I'll see some clue in this experiment. So don't interfere. Oh? You've finished talking? Yes. But I'll warn you that I won't let you harm my students. {\ko79}{\q2}Pantsu, {\ko92}Shitsu, {\ko100}Scunci, {\ko84}Risci, {\ko90}Kim Soul, {\ko77}Spoots, {\ko87}Ora honto, {\ko150}{\q2}Fup kuteeba, {\ko95}Kusreeb, {\ko81}Bujjibto, {\ko52}Buhimo, {\ko206}Bumbetsu Kuo! {\ko0} Hey! Wise-man Sage! That's... That's a spell book, right? No, that's an ero magazine! Okay! {\q0}O great ero god, I most graciously request that you transform me, into lingerie! Rather than merely obsessing over boobs all year round, I will become something that gets to hold them the whole time. By becoming a brassiere, I will become an ero servant! The Legendary Sage's experiment was just so he could physically become lingerie? That's right. A former follower of the church is doing an experiment on becoming lingerie. It's a humiliation against the church. So that's the reason for the arrest warrant. So this is the path that must be taken in order to continue the way of ero. I may be weak right now, but one day I will reach that level! I still need one more boost! Wise-man Sage! Do you need another ero magazine? If so, I'll give one— No! I need something more than just this. Panties! That's it! Show me your panties. But didn't you have the ability to see them from outside? At this moment, I'm focusing on transforming. I cannot break my concentration to use that ability. Someone! Someone, please, show him your panties! If you show him your panties, his strength will definitely come back! If you don't then all his efforts up until now will go to waste! Someone! Please! Show your panties! Then, here are Gya-kun's panties. No! Wha—!? This one is a man! What's happening! The spell is unstable! {\t(2000,2200,1,\3c&HFFFFFF;&}It's out of control! What is that? This is the result of someone not being able to control their magic. Irina, it'll be difficult to arrest him like this. That's true, now there's no choice but to defeat him. Defeat me? Don't underestimate me! What!? What's happening!? Oh, my! No! {\move(640,678,640,620,1750,2000)}That's right! Obey me! Eh, wait! My bra is moving by itself! Ah, wait! Akeno! Hey, Akeno! What are you doing!? My, my! This isn't so bad. This is rather annoying. I-I'm sorry! Damn! What kind of magic is this!? Th-This is a feast for my eyes— uh, I mean, I'm totally not looking! Damn it! I can't see! Yuuto-senpai! I'll just have to stop time— I can't stop time like this! Gya-kun is useless. Koneko-chan's bullying me... Damn! If only I could see. Don't forget about me you slime-ball! Futile! In the name of the God, I'm going to punish you! Amen! You're the one who doesn't wear underwear! Shut up! Don't interfere! Oh, so you're the one from back then... Now you remember!? Your underwear is the best amongst all. It's the base of my magic. Be proud! That's the same bra I saw awhile ago. There is no mistaking it, it's Irina's favourite bra! That's right! I will never forgive the one who shamed me by stealing my underwear. For that reason, I volunteered myself for this mission! Now, return my favourite bra! I've already absorbed all the magical energy from it. So you can have it back if you miss it so much. Oh no! I've got it! Everyone, take off your bra. President! Nice idea! Your perversity is evident. You are the worst. Humph, too naïve! My, my! Now what!? {\move(640,678,640,620,1850,2100)}Issei! Don't just watch, do something! Okay! But... What should I do? Gasper's panties drove him crazy, so he mustn't like male underwear. If he sees more he should get distracted and that'll release us us. Oh, I see! Hey! Wise-man Sage! Get a load of these! Don't mess with me. What!? Issei-san, I'm sorry! He's the worst. Issei-kun, don't touch me like that in a place like this. Wait, Issei! It's not me. I'm not doing anything! {\move(640,678,640,620,50,300)}Your boobs are moving by themselves! Ah, don't! Issei, I didn't know you could be this aggressive. Issei-kun, what exactly are doing to Xenovia? I told you, I'm not doing anything! Ah, but this sensation... Delicious, soft, supple... Is this what it would be like living in Heaven? You're a devil now, so you won't be able to go up there.{how'd he know what he's thinking?} Now I'm envious. Someone like you shouldn't get to drown his face in so many boobs. I can't move my body! I want to wrap myself around these boobs. I want to wrap myself around these luscious bodies. M-My body— We're being sucked in. I can't use my magic at all. He's also sucked my strength. If this continues— Wise-man Sage! You had to endure a lot for this experiment, right!? Do you want to end up becoming a demon!? Wouldn't you then regret doing all this!? Is that what you really want!? Silence! I love the female body, especially their soft boobs! {\fad(500,0)}I will become the lingerie that wraps all these bodies and cradles their boobs. {\ko126}You're {\ko124}wrong! What was that? You're wrong. You wanted to become lingerie? That's not right! What's important isn't the lingerie, it's what's within them. Boobs are what's important! Boobs? Boobs are boobs because they're beyond the hand that wants to squeeze them. Always just beyond reach! But, we must always believe, because one day we will reach them. That is the dream of every man! Someday I will touch them! Someday I will squeeze them! Someday I will suck them! And for that, we must move forward! Touch, squeeze, suck... Heed my words. It's wrong to even consider hiding boobs. If it were simple to have this many boobs in front of us, they wouldn't be special. That's why... That's why they're boobs! I was wrong! I've been wrong all this time! Issei-san! I-Issei! Wait, this is not the time to be doing this. Everyone, what should I do? Ah... This had nothing to do with the Philosopher's Stone. Oi, Issei! Think about the situation. Before you is underwear. {\q0}All the women are trapped in there, so they're practically wearing it. So Issei, isn't this a chance to use your special skill? Women... Clothes... Of course! Wise-man Sage, your path is the one that I strive for. Therefore, it is my duty to stop you, for you have strayed from that path. Here comes my knock-out blow! I... {\ko258}Dress {\ko109}Break! It's all right to touch boobs. It's all right to suck on boobs. It's all right to sink yourself in boobs. Yes, my lord. I'll be escorting him to the central church. So I'll leave you here. It's been too long since I've been able to have this much fun. We'll meet again, right? Yes, very soon! I felt your knock-out blow in my heart. Wise-man. Do not deviate from the path you've chosen. And someday, you'll conquer the path of ero. Of course! Oh right, you can have all these. {\fad(0,800)}I want you to inherit my legacy. Well then, I say goodbye to you, members of the Gremory household. Stay well. Let's see now, it's going to be a huge inconvenience returning all these to their owners. So I'm hoping someone will volunteer to do it... You've always worked so hard. So please keep at it this time as well, Issei-kun. Seriously? {\fad(0,1500)}President!
