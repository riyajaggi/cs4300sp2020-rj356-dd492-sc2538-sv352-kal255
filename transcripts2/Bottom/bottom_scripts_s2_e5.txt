 Ho, ho... urrgh ! It'll cost you ten quid, Santa Claus ! I don't know why I bother ! Every year the same ! There you are ! Ta very much. That was a particularly nasty fall ! And season's greetings to you, too, little fellow ! Ho, ho, ho ! Christ, I think I've broken my leg ! Merry Christmas, Eddie ! I thought I heard sleigh bells. Has he been ? Oh, he has ! Oh, joy, oh, joy ! Let's open our presents ! Oh, look, mine's bigger than yours ! That must mean I've been a nicer boy than you ! Go back to bed. It's half-past three. No present opening till half-past seven ! Come on, let's see what Santa's brought us ! Oooh !

 Ooh ! It's a... It's a Brussels sprout. That should come in handy for Christmas lunch ! Ooh... it's a... it's another Brussels sprout ! Thought so ! We must have enough for a whole Christmas lunch now ! Good old Santa thinks of everything. That's present number 113. Another Brussels sprout. Mustn't forget the thank you letter list ! Don't want Santa to think we're ungrateful... Eddie ? You've fallen asleep again ! Aren't you going to open your stocking ? Well, I would, but there doesn't seem to be much in this small child's sock. Perhaps you haven't been a very good little boy. Did you post my letter to Father Christmas ? I can't seem to find the Star bird I asked for, or me Batman cape, or the ticket to the Bahamas ! You can't expect Santa to put expensive gifts like that in a stocking ! Well, he ought to 'cause I signed the letter "Eddie Hitler. On y va qui mal y pense, Eddie ! Qui mal y pense ! Now, come on, it's time ! Let's get our big ones out ! Tee hee A big Christmas joke like "Do you like stuffing ?" Now, what have you got me ? Here you go, Richie. - Aren't you going to open it ? - I don't think I'll bother. Why not ? What's wrong with it ? It's about 20 times too small. It's the thought that counts. No, it's not. It's the size that counts. Don't you read "Cosmopolitan" ? How can I ? They're all hidden under your mattress. That'll do ! Let's try and keep it festive ! God, I hate Christmas ! I thought you were getting me something sun-kissed and exotic ! And I have. Just open it ! It's a miniature bottle of Malibu ! It's an EMPTY miniature bottle of Malibu ! Correct ! Merry Christmas, Richie ! - What use is that ? - You can use it to keep Malibu in, so long as you keep it away from me. Hic ! Right, that's it ! Hang on, hang on ! I was only joking. It's good for morale. Look, here's your big one ! Oh ! Oh, Eddie, you haven't ! You haven't ! - No, you haven't ! - What do you mean ? - It's empty. - No, it's not ! Beg your pardon. There's a toilet roll in here. A used toilet roll ! That is not a used toilet roll. That is a play telescope ! I've drawn a picture of Sue Carpenter in a bikini on the beach at one end ! Hey, that's bloody good, Eddie ! Why has she got five legs ? No, that's her hand. She's waving. It's perspective ! Hello, Richie ! Yes, that's bloody good ! Hey ! She's only got one knocker. No, that's a speech bubble. She's talking to you. Oh, yes, so she is ! "Fick urf... "...you sad, pathtic winker." I wonder what she means ? - Well, where's mine ? - All right ! What is it ? It's a picture. Oh, a picture. What of ? Of me ! A self-portrait. Don't you like it ? It's bollocks, isn't it, Richie ? No, it's not, it's one of mine, although he is awfully good. We have a similar style. A lot of people say my work looks like Bollocks. Let's go downstairs and see where we can hang it ! - It could go next to the table. - That should help me lose weight. We could stick it in the toilet ! Not a bad idea. I doubt if the flush mechanism could handle it, though. What ? I've got the perfect place for it ! Right a bit, I think. No, left. Down a bit. Hold it there. Yep, that's just about dandy. That looks lovely ! You're a philistine, Edward Hitler ! It took me 15 minutes to paint that ! God, seven o'clock. Another 27 hours of Christmas to go. I won't survive. I'll have to blank out in front of the telly. No one watches the telly until the Queen's speech ! It's Noel's Christmas Family Video Accidents ! I don't care. We're going to do Christmas properly, unless there's a Bond film on. OK ? Let's keep it Christmassy. There's only five hours till lunch. I have to get my sprouts on. Don't want them crunchy. Not sprouts ! - I hate sprouts ! - Stop whingeing ! Nobody likes sprouts ! Why are we having them, then ? Because it's Christmas ! We've got guests coming, so I'd better get on with my turkey. What are you going to do with it ? It's the season of goodwill, so I'll chop its feet off, rip out its innards, shove an onion up its arse and cook it till it's burnt. - Fair enough. - Right, now peel the potatoes. We've four people coming so that means... four potatoes. Do you really want me to peel them ? You'll only incinerate them. Why don't we just bung 'em straight in the bin ? All right, I'll do all the cooking... ...so long as you do all the decorations. Now, crackers ? Yes, but it's never stopped me so far ! Have you got the crackers ? No, it's just the way my trousers hang ! Eddie, enough of the cracker jokes. I'm talking about the things you hold and pull. I've got one of those but I'm not sticking it on the table ! You are funnier than Jonathan Ross. But he's not funny. Exactly. Get out of my kitchen before I twot you. - Not fast enough ! - Fair enough. Point taken. You scrape all the congealed bits off the cutlery and lay the table, I'll get on with the brandy butter. Where's the brandy ? Er... Hic ! That's effing marvellous, isn't it ?! Hold your horses, Richie ! Don't panic, because... Vodka margarine ! That's brilliant. Are you sure it's flammable ? I anticipated your concern, so I spiced it up with a couple of cans of hairspray. That is brilliant ! Well done ! That's sorted. Now, table placings. I thought I'd put you next to Spudgun because you're both... ...well, sort of, ugh, you know, aren't you ? Did you get four quid off them each for the meal ? - Yes, I did. - Where is it ? I spent it on the brandy. I don't believe it ! You're no help at all ! You've done nothing towards this season's goodwill ! You haven't even bought a tree ! - Yes, I have ! - Where is it ? Shield your eyes and I shall wheel her in ! No, there's no time. Ta-da ! That's not a Christmas tree, it's a geranium ! Well, whatever it is, it cost 16 quid. - 16 quid ?! - So that's eight quid you owe me. Eight quid ? That's nearly 50 pence a needle ! Oh, I despair, I really do ! And it's half-past eight already ! Half-past eight and all's crap ! I've got to get into my kitchen ! Spray-on snow to make everything Christmassy. I'll scrub my sprouts. I thought you were going to do some cooking. Fair enough. Point taken. Right, it's simple enough. It's potatoes anglaise. Sprouts ? la... ...? la water... And turkey ? la... ...oven ! That should get their taste buds going ! When it comes down to it, there's only me and Keith Floyd left ! Bloody hell ! Bloody hell, Eddie ! Help ! Help ! Why ? - What have you done ? - I'd have thought that was obvious ! Oh, I see. Ooh ! That's a bit of a nasty nick, isn't it ? Why don't you call an ambulance ? I haven't got anything to dial with now ! First aid ! What's the procedure for someone who's chopped their finger off ? I think they bleed to death in half an hour. I don't want to die ! What did we do in the Boy Scouts ? No, there's no time for that. Apply a tourniquet - before I lose consciousness ! - Okey-dokey. What is a tourniquet ? It's when you restrict the flow of blood around the body. Come on ! All the blood's rushing to your head. Don't worry, I'll keep it there ! Look, it's working ! Look, I found your finger ! Pull your finger out, Richie ! - This is no time for fun and games ! - Yes, it is. It's Christmas Day ! Oh, it's worked ! Get your needle out. You'd better sew it back on. I don't know. You know me and my sewing ! Yes, that reminds me, I must take the dress you made me to the charity shop. That wasn't a dress. That was a woolly hat. Was it ? Never mind, because... I'm a dab hand with one of these ! Ooh, God ! Ooh, agh ! Thanks, Eddie. AGH ! Sorry, wrong finger ! Urrgh ! It worked ! Thank God ! Good ! Everything's going swimmingly ! Hot enough for you, little sprouts ? Or is that the potatoes ? Or is it the stuffing ? Everything looks the same ! That means everything's ready ! Look at the time ! They'll be here soon. Is the tree ready ? Yep. There she is ! Shall I fire her up ? Rather ! Get a bit of Christmas glow going ! Right... Contact. That's quite a lot of Christmas glow, isn't it ? Shall I open the window ? Um... yes, thank you very much. And there she goes... ...same as usual. - That's the tenth one that's gone up like that. - Yeah. Do you remember that electrician's course I went on ? I'm beginning to think I should have stayed for the full half hour. Oh, Christmas ! Ding dong merrily on bloody high ! Why's it always so desperately depressing ? Why does it never snow ? You can't make a drizzle man, can you ? Can't play drizzle balls ! At least the drizzle will put the tree out and nothing else can go wrong ! Agh ! Open the window before I faint from the pain ! Thank you. Eddie, come this way ! I don't know why I bother ! I really don't ! Eddie, stand back. Merry Christmas ! Lordy, lordy, it's the guests ! We've got no time for fighting now ! We'll pick up where we left off later. Remember where we got up to. It'll be bloody difficult to forget ! Well, just in case... ...remember that ! Tidy up. I'll welcome them over the threshold. - I'm coming ! Can't wait to eat me out of house and home, parasitic bastards ! Hello, Dave Hedgehog ! How are you ? No, I'm Dave. Oh, God, my eyes ! I really must stop masturbating ! Damn ! Well, hello ! Gosh, it's been what ? Raining ? - No, no, it's been ages. - What has ? Well, since we last, you know... We never, you know, with you ! No, it's all going wrong. This is silly ! Come in ! Come ye ! Come ye ! God rest ye merry gentlemen Let nothing you dismay Remember... Er... You said he was being put away before Christmas ! She won't last long. She lost a lot of blood this morning and she hasn't got the stamina ! Great, shall we have a drink, then ? Here we are. Drinks coming right up ! What's that ?! Gravy. Gravy ? Somebody drank all the sherry, didn't they, Eddie ? Hic ! - Well, I'm not drinking that ! - I beg your pardon ? - I said I'm not drinking that. - You just drink that up right now or do I have to force it down your throat ? Eh ? Eh ? - What do you reckon ? - Drink it. He's a psycho. Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas, one and all ! Is it Christmas ? Today ? Merry Christmas, then. That must be why that woman gave me that aftershave. - What woman ? - That old woman who hangs round the place. You know, what's-her-name, my wife. Andrea, no, no, Avril. No, what am I thinking of ? Susan, that's the one ! Spudgun, you go next to Eddie because you're both so ghastly. You go next to me. Anyone who turns up might take you for a Bohemian rather than the sad, unemployable wretch you are. Enjoy yourselves ! It's supposed to be Christmas ! Heavens above ! - What's that smell ? - That's lunch. Thank God for that. I thought I'd had an accident ! Right, here we go ! - One potato or two ? - Two, please. No... ...one. No, two. - No, one ! - OK, one. That's better. I changed my mind. None. 'Scuse fingers. - Help yourself to sprouts. - Oh, no, not sprouts. Sprouts. So it IS Christmas, then. Now, then, who likes stuffing ? Ha, ha, ha ! Oh, no one. Oh, well, worth it for the joke, eh ? Cor ! What a magnificent bird ! - Where ? - Gets 'em every year ! Here we go, then. Hey, who's for a lovely juicy bit of breast ? Ha, ha, ha ! I love Christmas ! Eddie, are you a leg or a breast man ? Would you like a magazine to read while he tells his Christmas jokes ? It's all academic now. I've made a slight miscalculation with the timing. Never mind ! Let's get straight onto the pudding ! - Eddie, switch out the lights. - Righto. - Switch the lights back on ! - Righto ! Wait until I get to the pudding before you switch out the lights. - Righto ! - Wait ! Just smearing the vodka margarine on it ! Are you sure this will sustain the flame ? It should do. It's been soaking for two weeks. Should go up a treat. - Here goes. Switch off the lights. - Righto ! Bloody hell ! Well, same time next year, lads ? Merry Christmas. No, no, come on ! There's plenty of Christmas fun left ! No one likes pudding anyway ! Let's pull some crackers. What, there's some birds coming ? Ha, ha, ha ! Yeah, Christmas is great with jokes, isn't it ? Come on ! Chivvy, chivvy ! If it wasn't for me, you'd sit around all day drinking and watching the television ! They've changed the titles to "Emmerdale Farm". It's just called "Emmerdale" now. Doesn't take so long to read. Gives you a lot more time to do other things. Can pack a lot more story in. Mmm... Mmm... - Mmm... Mmm... - We still can't hear you ! If I speak, I'm out of the game. You just spoke, so you're out of the game, then ! Stop ! New game, OK ? When I go like this, it means it's a film. All right ? So, it's a film. Well, what's it called ? No, you're supposed to tell me. Why, don't you know ? If you don't know, we could be here all night ! - You have to guess ! - Tell us. It's a lot quicker. All right, stop, stop ! Shall we start again ? Off we go. - It's a film. - It's a TV programme. - They televised it ? - Or it's on video ? No, no, no ! It's not a film. You just said it was a film ! - All right. I'll go back to the film ! - Just tell us what it is ! All right. It was "The Guns of Navarone". Satisfied ? Right. My turn. "Goldfinger" ! Right, Hedgehog. I'll have "Goldfinger" as well. You can't have that. Eddie had that. Let's just all have "Goldfinger" and then pack it in, OK ? Right, Spudgun. "Goldfinger". Right, now that's that over with, OK ? What's next ? Sardines ! Anything's better than that bloody turkey ! - Oh, Jesus Christ, who can that be ?! Are they collecting on Christmas Day ? Sod off, you do-gooding bastards ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Who is it ? I don't know. He can't talk. Well, punch him in the face and kick him down the stairs ! If he's too drunk to talk, he won't put up much of a fight, will he ? Go on ! Enjoy yourself ! It's Christmas ! Look, guys, it's a baby. What ? I've got a baby. We don't want a baby. Get rid of it. We're happy as we are. Why spoil everything ? We'll drift apart ! I mean, it's bound to come between us. Well, I think that it's come between us already. Come on, Eddie ! It's time we faced up to our responsibilities ! We can't carry on being playboys all our lives ! Besides... it's a fact now. We have to deal with it ! Why couldn't you be more careful ? Poor little mite. What a way to spend your first Christmas ! Lying on your back with a bottle sounds pretty good to me ! Don't cry, little matey ! Coo-ee ! I think he likes me ! Poor little blighter ! His first Christmas, no family, no friends, no Christmas presents ! Well, he's got us now. We'll look after him. Yeah, he can have my Christmas present. It's a box of Terry's All Gold. He'll have to wait for his little teeth before he can manage the chewy ones. Yeah, and he can have my Frankenstein mask. I was going to scare the shit out of Richie with it later. Agh ! Oh ! And you can have my bottle of aftershave. It's a new one. It's called "Grrr !" Gold, Frankenstein and "Grrr !" And you're all wearing crowns ! And I'm a virgin ! - I thought you said you weren't ! - I was fibbing to look hunky. Oh, didn't work, did it ? No, but enough of that. Guys, if I was you, I'd stay on my knees. This is it. This is the Second Coming. - What ? - Well, look ! The three kings, gold, Frankenstein and "Grrr !", the virgin birth. And look - a blue headscarf ! I mean, that really tops it off ! It's all slotting into place. I knew I was special ! I always knew I was different from the other people ! That's why I never got a shag ! I was being kept pure because I'm better than everyone else in the whole world ! Had a few pretty narrow squeaks, though ! Oh, yes... I didn't really. I'm lying to meself ! Guys... ...I think that we should pray. - I think his nappy needs changing. - What ? Yeah, go on, Richie. I mean, you're his mother. Aw, come on, guys. This is the 20th century. It's not fair. But we are not worthy, O holy one. Yeah, that's right, O chosen thing. Yeah, O one... ...what he said. What do you mean, "What he said" ? You're supposed to be a wise man ! All right. I'll do it. Who'd be a woman ? I don't know ! Are you sure he's the son of God ? Nobody smoke ! Eddie, get the mop and the bucket and the bleach. What ?! You can't put bleach on a baby's bottom ! Let me have a go. I come from a large family. You'd have to, wouldn't you ! You know, what we need is some girls with really big breasts ! You've been saying that for 20 years. Not for me, you fool ! For the baby ! He's very good with the baby, isn't he ? Yes, he is. I am thinking of conferring a sainthood upon him. What, Saint Spudgun ? Haven't you got through to the Pope yet ? No, he's gone. Right, then. Next one, Pope G. Pope G ? He's not Pope Gavin, is he ? It's Pope John Paul ! - Look under Pope JP ! - Oh, right, JP. Pope JP. I didn't know he lived in Twickenham ! Fancy that ! Did you know... ? Stop that ! You show some respect ! I'm not going to let the arrival of the son of God spoil my Christmas ! Ooh, some terrible things will happen to you when you finally pop off ! Yes, I shall have a word with Richard Junior's father - you know, my husband-in-law, God ! I shall make sure you get a right proper roasting and no mistake ! It's not just my flat now, it's my universe ! My name... is now Richard Mary... ...and you all have to do everything I say otherwise you will all go to hell ! Yeah ! Bloody hell ! This would work a treat with Tracey down the Lamb & Flag ! I need some commandments. One, everyone has to give me their money. Two, all the girls in the world have to take their tops down now. NOW ! Three, no one's allowed to hit me ever again in my whole life ! Hello, boys ! Merry Christmas and all that bollocks ! I didn't knock 'cause I couldn't be bothered. Mr Harrison, you may be our landlord but I'm the mother of God, so if you... Oh, bugger off, you sad git ! Now, where's my grandson ? Your... grandson ? Are you deaf ? My daughter left him with me. She'll be back soon, cow ! She went to see her bloody mother. Stupid bitch had a heart attack this morning. Expects us all to gather round, and there's "Goldfinger" on the telly ! On Christmas Day - I ask ya ! Sorry I didn't ask but I knew you'd say no so I thought, "Sod it !" You bloody coo, you ! Keep your trap shut about my daughter or I'll tell the police you kidnapped him ! - Where's Johnny ? - I was showing him off to the neighbours ! He's such a bonny... bloody... thing ! Poor thing, he's hungry. I'd better feed him. Bring him over here, Dad. - You don't mind, do you, gents ? - No, no ! Go ahead ! Merry bloody Christmas !
