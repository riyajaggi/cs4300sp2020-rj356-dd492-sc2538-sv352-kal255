 That fire's dying down. This was necessary. 'Cause now I need you for what comes next. And what's that? Why'd you come to us, Joel? You found me. Yeah, outside of Houndsville in that dog shit knuckle ring. They called you Joel the Mover, the bare‐knuckle champ rumored to have sailed the world. But you know when I found you? When I saw you what you did to your opponent.

 That's when I found you. A lost man with a grievance against the world, a grievance against himself, and a man that needed a family... Like me... like Bash, like every single one of us. And when we tell them what the Ghouls did to us, they're gonna remember what it's like to be a Brawler, to have a family. And those who were not with us... They're gonna see what we're capable of. They're gonna watch us rise and burn and consume... and prosper. So, Joel the Mover,

 you can leave. Or you can put those Ghouls' masks on those Brawlers' heads and join us. And you join family. Yeah? Jukes, it's Joel. We need to meet. All right. Where you wanna do this? Your place. Thank you for your time. Good night, Preacher. And what was all that about? To bed, Anna. No! How could you? Well, I'm‐‐ well, I'm sorry, Miss Anna, but... If Tammy can forgive‐‐ Looking a few days ahead, this nice weather will continue with mostly sunny skies and mild temperatures in the upper 60s. Nighttime lows will hover around 58. The winds today are from the southwest at 14 miles per hour. Excuse me. I was... I was wondering if I could have a cup of coffee. What are you reading? I like reading too. I'd be reading right now, but I left my books at home. I like mysteries myself. You ever read Elmore Waterhaven? He wrote mysteries. Personally, I always thought of him as more of a philosopher than a mystery teller, but... My husband didn't really like reading. Actually, I don't think I ever saw him with a book in his hand. Course, he didn't really do much of anything, I guess. He just‐‐well, you know, he drank. And he died. He did that. He died from drinking? Can you tell me where's the nearest bus station? Tough spot you could have put us in. I had a plan, and he didn't disappoint. - Was he a friend of yours? - Did he seem like a friend of mine? - Well, you brought him here. - Because if I hadn't, he would have found you eventually. And we would have taken care of him. And instead, I did. And that shit was impressive. Good, because I want you to feel I can be on your team. The fuck is a Bang‐A‐Rang anyway? Like, a nightclub or some shit? It's a little more, um... 'round the clock than that. And these guys, you said they're your brother's gang. They are. And you mentioned he dragged you behind a truck. He did. What would they do that for? I'm afraid that part is... A little complicated. So you want us to rob 'em, and then you can, uh... well, you know, do your thing. The score. That's what you'd be interested in, and me, I just‐‐I just need the support. - We don't kill people. - Unless you have to. Isn't that what you said? Unless you have to? You sure they got money? Plenty of it. Each Bang‐A‐Rang has its own vault. One we could have access to, just in and out. Because of your dude on the inside? Yes, my... dude on the inside. Well, he's gonna have to know what he's looking out for, and you're gonna have to know how we work. Mm‐hmm. Tomorrow morning, we'll pick you up, show you how it's done. Aw, I joined this here army to join in the fun, a‐jabbin' the Japs and huntin' with guns. And look at the job that they hand out to me. KP. KP. KP. Your beard looks like shit. Joel the Mover, now a remnant of the years like the rest of us. Legends get old. Gary, turn that shit off. Get out of here, both of you. Say, who in the blooming blue blazes is you? Technical Fairy, First Class. I heard you saying that everything stank‐‐ Some oatmeal? No, thanks. How's Burt? Sure he's fine. There's a rumor going around that he's dead and you guys are just covering up for it. You haven't been paying your tax. You're supposed to pay us 60% on all you take in. Well aware of the number, Joel. I'll drop it to 35. 35, and we'll give you back the northeast corner of the county. And in return? Our little scrimmage couple weeks back... Noticed you weren't there. Sent Konstantinov in my place. Was that really your call? Konstantinov's not exactly someone to take to take no for an answer these days‐‐ Is he the only one of yours not taking no these days? Can't have close calls like that, Jukes. If you would have turned those boys over to us, I would have sent them straight back to you. We put you guys on hard times. I know that. This place, your bars, that two‐bit fucking drug ring you run... All falling apart... for many years now. Pay your tax. 35%, northeast corner, so long as you take control of your guys. That's it. Mm. What's in it for you? No war and never having to see any of you ever again. Hmm. So from Joel the Mover to Joel the Peacekeeper, huh? All gotta live our lives. Let me ask you something. You ever actually believe that bullshit story all those years ago? Our guys ambushing you like that? you don't stop whoever the fuck's selling Scratch to Meredith, deal is off and I burn your everything. Where will the auction be held? Where will the auction be held? How many pounds does your cat weigh? How many pounds does your cat weigh? The bones are in the wheelbarrow. The bones are in the wheelbarrow. Right where they belong. Oh. Humid today. Feel like the humidity always brings the rain. Does it feel like rain out there? I'm sorry, I‐I didn't realize... Um, that'll be, uh, 7, uh, 54. Yeah, so, uh... that's Meredith's, huh? Not yet, it ain't. She said she paid. Not in full. How's your belly, fool? Didn't I knock you out? Eh. She said she paid in full, Gary. Paid in full when I was dealing with just her. She didn't say anything about sending you three rats over here. Said you didn't have a tow. We have a tow. Look, Gary, we apologize, all right? We were just trying to show the new guy some fun. Didn't realize things would get out of hand the way it did. However... from what we heard, you boys got a spanking about not paying your tax. I could be mistaken, but to me, it seems like if I was to go back, tell Meredith you said she didn't pay, what happens when she goes to Daddy Burt, talking about how the Ghouls ripped her off? And after everything we all just did to cool down... So maybe quit the shakedown bullshit and give us the fucking bike. When this goes south, and it will... I'm coming for you first, Matty. You and many others, pal. Excuse me. Any trouble? A little bit. Why? They kick your asses again? Well, you boys keep being so sweet, I might just give you a ride. I wouldn't be caught dead on that thing. Mr. Purist. You're welcome, by the way. Heh. I'll see you boys with the cops tonight. - Cops? - Mm‐hmm. It's Cop Night tonight. - Cop Night? - Fucking Cop Night. Few times a year, Brawlers let 'em in, let 'em all in... show 'em a good time, let 'em blow off whatever steam they got under their belts. And in addition to some other financial arrangements, they turn a blind eye... to everything. Whoo! You're looking fine. Whoo! Toast, boys. Joel, I say this every fucking time, but... thanks for this. Glad you're having a good time. Mm. So I got something interesting for ya. One of my guys, they spotted him. Where? Thrift store just outside Shawtown. Trailed him in an unmarked but lost him up by Route Dixon. You sure it was him? I think anyone would know Burt Harlow if they saw him. Well... he's alive. Seems like it. Listen, I can have them do a sweep of the area if you like, get a more specific location. No, just, um... Just keep me posted. Mm. Will do. Say... you got any of that other stuff? You know, the good stuff? My man. He just kept staring at me. I know. Isn't he the one that arrested you? She's right. It was. And there he is. I need whatever Scratch you have. I don't have any. You told me to stop, so I did. It's for the cops. Good to know. Yeah, and we don't let cops pay... for anything. Ain't that rich? You just let all your principles fly right out the window for the boys in blue, don't you? How much? All of it. You're one hell of a host, Joel. Thank you. No problem. Fuck. Fuck. Oh, I recognize you. Arrested you once. Yeah. You probably do recognize him. Dude's wanted for murder up in Detroit. You get that APB, Officer? Huh. Nah. I haven't seen anything from Detroit. Relax, little Phoenix. Told you... you're with us now. Oh. Where are you off to today? Just running some errands. Oh. Well... I'll be leaving this afternoon. I'm sorry? Figured I should let you know. There's a train station not far from here, I guess. I'm going to hail a cab, buy a ticket, and get on a train that will take me to Detroit. And what do you think is going to happen once you travel to Detroit, Molly? You have... so much purpose, Doris. I can see it in you, and I... envy it. But... I can't sit here in the dark any longer. Colin kept me in the dark, and now I'm in the dark again while you go out and... and pursue it, while you pursue your purpose. And I... I pursue nothing. I pursue nothing, Doris. That's always been my problem. I'm going to say you killed Colin and that you kidnapped me and that I escaped and that I‐I don't know where you are. And then I'm going to take the restaurant, and even though I‐I may have to deal with Big Graham, I'm going to make you proud with it. That's what I'm going to do. Are you going to tell them that... Colin was your idea to begin with? That's very unfair of you. My point is, Molly... we're in this together. We've been in this together. If we're in this together, then... then why can't you tell me what you're up to? Molly... sweetheart. You don't wanna know what I'm up to. You good? Long morning already, but all good. Thank you, Cordell. Hi. I'm looking for a Doris Quinn and/or a Molly Quinn. A what? Two women, possibly guests here. I don't any of the guests' names, man. I just check 'em in. Then may I see your ledger? No. Why not? It's confidential, man. You know what? Whatever you want, all right? Ethan. I'd like to ask you a question. Do you trust me? W‐what do you mean? Because if I'm going to help you get out of trouble, I might need some help of my own. - Like how? - Here's how we work. First, it's all about principles. Now, any given time, we're usually clocking about 3 to 12 underground operations. And they all got one thing in common: ain't none of 'em good people. We don't rob no one that's good. So whenever we're clocking somebody, it's usually about the bad they're up to. Like this guy, Carburetor Ron and his mechanic scam. As if it ain't bad enough that old money ripping off people in this community with some overpriced shady‐ass work. The guy also does the classic smuggling shit. Gets that South American drug work in, cut and corrupted. All kinds, all prices. Pollutes the community. Then there's the fish spot. Another classic operation. Diamonds, rubies, what have you, all smuggled in fish. They get jewels from other galaxies is what I heard. That's not an actual thing, but I do appreciate the myth. The point is, they're up to no good, because half of the fish go rotten. And all them jewels are stolen like a motherfucker. It's a huge fucking waste. Then we got the Piano Man. Piano Devil, as we like to call him. Dude fixes pianos but got some whole other bullshit going on. Considers himself a reverend, Reverend Paulie Piano. He has an entirely fake‐ass religion and a bunch of lost‐ass followers going behind his every word. Love of God! - It's kind of sad. - It's very sad... especially because his thing, it's extremely fucked up. Come on! Convinces his followers they need to exorcise their demons through knife fights. That they can actually cleanse themselves of their troubles if they wanna fight to the death. The real problem is, though, Reverend Paulie then invites a bunch of his degenerate‐ass pals to come place bets on who's gonna win. And that's where we come in. Hmm. Because the next part is all about calculation. 'Cause we watch. And we schedule. It takes patience. Hey! Move, move, move! But if we don't know their schedule... If we don't take our time... If we don't learn their every single drop, when money's coming in... And when it's going out... Then we don't know how to move. So what's your boy gotta do? Our schedule? Checkpoints, when you're supposed to arrive, when the drops happen, and the vaults. I've never actually seen any of the vaults. Well, just work on that, figure out how it works, and‐‐and we'll talk. I guess I don't have any choice but to trust you, then, huh, Doris? I'd say you're a little too far down the road not to. Wouldn't you agree? It's a strange thing, Molly, that story of yours. Is it what you needed to clear Big Graham's name? Hmm? Oh. Maybe. Probably. Do you know any languages... other than English? I‐‐ I find them fascinating. Uh, complex strings of syllables with different meanings, uh, the history of different interpretations of the human condition. I knew Colin a long time. We all did. All loved him... And all always found it so confounding that he ended up with you. He'd be out at the strip clubs all night, few dozen mistresses... We would all‐‐we would all say to him, "Colin, buddy, what are you doing with this broad "if you're just gonna go running around like that? Live your life, man." I miss him. Good guy. Which is why... well, Molly... It's why I'm really going to enjoy this. Oh, Molly. I'm really, really going to enjoy this. You look troubled, doll face. Been a weird day. Ain't every day around here a little weird? Good point. Beer? Actually, uh, starting to think my liver's rotting out. Was wondering if I should cut back on the booze. Well, beer's not booze. It's beer. So they haven't scared you off yet. They've come pretty close. So what actually brought you here? I, uh... I just, uh, heard about it. You heard about it? Yup. Just... something to do? Something like that. So why that bike? The one you had us pick up. Why not one of the rods that are lying around on the lot? Jesus, the rods? Have you seen them? They're ugly as shit. I thought that was the point. Oh, okay, you mean the whole, um, "beast on the outside, purpose under the hood"? Brawler folklore bullshit. They're a bunch of idiots, all of 'em. You grew up here, right? So you were around for all of it? Around for all of what? The big war... with all the gangs, the one everyone talks about. I mean, I was pretty young. I don't really remember. Except that I do... remember. I mean, I remember how it felt. I'm not saying that I was afraid, 'cause I didn't understand enough about what the hell was going on to be afraid. What I mean is that I... It felt dark. It felt dark. And maybe that's why I've always wanted to leave. I don't know. Where you wanna go? I'm on tonight. Maybe I'll see ya out there. A lot to take in, right? Quite a bit. It's impressive. Now, what we need to know is your timeline here. When do you wanna start on this? - Pretty soon. - Soon as in‐‐ This week. That's a lot of moving parts and not a lot of time. Do you have time for some tea? Maybe we could iron some things out. Tea sound good to me. Tea it is. What kind of tea do you prefer? - Peppermint. - Rooibos. I... He tried to do... the thing, and then I did the thing, and then... the thing happened. Well... that's fine. How the fuck that piece get there? Um... It doesn't look allergic to the sun. What do you mean? Look how pale it is. Yeah, but it's wood. Sun is good for wood. It's how it all grew in the first place. That's a pretty good point. Do you not want it, then? Ah. First... your presentation, please. Horsehound. Horsehound? Why? Allow me to read from its principles. "On the principles of Horsehound. "Principle number one: "the name Horsehound is derived from the function "of both a horse and a hound. "For, like a horse, it will ride proud and be fearlessly ridden by Daddy." That's you. "And at the same time, like a hound, it will hunt the Great Beast." Who's the Great Beast? The Great Beast is all that's bad in the world coming together as one and trying to pollute the good. Well, that sounds terrifying. - Hello, Queenie. - Hello, little one. Are you still making the friendly ones dance? Well, I'm not sure what you mean by "the friendly ones," and I don't make them, but yes. All right. Horsehound it is, then. Horsehound. Allergic to the sun. Sunscreen, I love it. Uncle Bru can help you get dinner started. Then it's time for bed. Uncle Bru, we have some meat in the freezer if you'd like some. I'll take it. Learn something new from her every day. Mm‐hmm. Was curious... Ghouls' tax. Yeah? Did you discuss reducing it with Burt before you just up and did it? Burt probably doesn't even remember what their tax was set at. Well, then you could have discussed it with me. That what this really about, you? It's about preserving our position. If we start making concessions, we appear weak. We start showing the others we're open to working with them instead of lording over them, then we preserve peace. That's how we preserve our position. If you're so afraid of a fight, Joel, why don't you just leave? Because you think this place will fall apart without you. Is that right? In which case... if you are worried about the little one, there's always Rita. You'll figure it out. We'll keep the Ghoul tax at 35% if you think that's best. And when Burt does come asking, I'm sure you'll convince him just fine. Who is it? It's me. We need to come inside. You ain't gotta do shit. Bernice, I can explain, but right now, we need to come inside, please. Hello, uh, Bernice. I apologize for interrupting, but, um... May we use your shower? Like I said, I‐‐ - You can explain. - Yeah. Sure. Bathroom's down the hall, honey. Thank you. Oh, um, you wouldn't happen to have any, um, cheesecloth for the... Okay. Tell me you cooked something. Just trust me on this, all right? How are you feeling? You were right. I can't go back. I see that now. Which means... I'm coming with you. Wherever the hell it is you're going, I'm coming with you, and there's nothing you can do to stop me. Will that be all right? Sure, Molly. That'll be all right. I'm gonna go out of town for a while for a job. With that woman? She's got something big, real big. Big enough, I think, that‐‐ - Don't... Earl, don't even think about saying it. I swear on my mother's goddamn grave. I mean it, Bernice. Now, look, I know she can be a bit... concerning. But she got a fucking plan. And what me and Cordell would come back with... that'd be it. It could have been it a while ago. We could do better is all I'm saying. It's all you're ever gonna say. Hmm. I want y'all out of here tomorrow. You can send me a postcard. BERNICE; Do you ever think about him when you're out there? You ever think about our little man? Or do you just... try to forget it all ever went down like that? Just keep... gunnin' and gunnin' and robbing it all away. It ain't even like that, Bernice. No, of course it ain't. Who was he? He was an attorney. An attorney. My husband's attorney. Yo, your husband sent him? My husband's dead. My husband's colleague, it was him that sent the attorney. You know what? You don't have to talk about the personal shit. That ain't what we're here for. I got mine. Cordell got his. I mean, we all got something. I don't even need to know why your brother dragged you behind a fucking truck. If I get a chance to meet him, maybe I'll ask him myself. But when we talk about being on a team, Dottie‐‐ I should have told you about Big Graham. I know. Big Graham. - My husband's colleague. - Yeah, no. Big Graham, like... Detroit Big Graham? Yes. That's who's after you? Yes. I know, uh... it's bad. Big‐‐Big Graham, like‐‐like ole head‐ass mobster Big Graham? Big Graham, like we robbed that boy six times, Big Graham? What the fuck? About to be a seventh time, Big Graham. Come on, now. Ole sleepy‐ass motherfucker? I wish he would bring his ass down here. Fuck you, man. He probably need a fucking pacemaker. Ole Benjamin Button‐faced‐ass nigga. Come on, son. Yo, the talk about Big Graham is making me sleepy. I‐I‐I'ma go to bed on that one. - Ha! - Big fucking Graham. Do you believe this shit? Oh, shit. So we on the same page, then, Dottie. Good. Good. One last thing before I forget. Monster Ring used to be a bit bigger back in the day. Ain't gotta talk about that now, but... We gonna be on a team... Ah, shit, here. I figure you can't leave ole girl here, and it sounds like you can't send her back home either. So... Welcome to The Monster Ring. Both of you. We leave in the morning. Mash good! Easy, Igor, you impetuous...
