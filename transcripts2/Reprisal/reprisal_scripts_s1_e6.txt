 Well, vets, today is the day. Though it all may seem so long ago, to many of us, it may seem like not long enough. But as we reflect today on the fall of the 37th, may all of us who served always stay proud, proud of the fact that when the call came, our country responded and when we responded, we did it for our love of the Archipelago. Men and women from abroad braved the tumultuous seas to liberate and protect. So as we celebrate our courage,

 drink in our valor, be sure to always remember that while much was lost, much was also gained. And when it was all over, we knew in our hearts it was worth it. Because forever in our hearts will always lie our love of the Archipelago. Stay strong, troops. Happy Day of the 37th. This message was brought to you by Tomato Corn Chowder. That's where they had it confused. The platoons. Small island thought it should all be one, the entire Archipelago conjoined. Platoons came in with their ideals, all their ideals.

 Fish. Whole Archipelago should've been blown off the map. That would've been my solution. Is that right? Hello, Percy. Eddie, I'm gonna need another round here. That's my big brother there. Where you been? This is harsh. From the Islands. We all took it to sleep. Now we can't shake it. Sorry I wasn't there. What happened there? Just part of something. Something special. A family. We were a family. And families can grow. You can come back with me. What, and leave my medal? Forget how important I am? There's big things coming. Not looking for another cause. - Build yourself a beast. - A what? A car. And cheat on old Thelma? Mm‐mm, I worked my ass off two years in a mine for that truck. I do like that jacket, though. Might be able to scrounge up a misfit for you. You do that. You still listen to that shit? Well, I tried. So many times... Some things don't change. Just what do you propose we do now? We could run away. A lot of things... Do, though. You wanna drink yourself to death, Percy, that's fine. But come do it somewhere I can at least check in on you. Come do it with family. Hmm. Yeah, I figured I'd give her a second life. Strange. She's, um... smooth. Well, guess he was a stubborn son of a bitch. Yeah. Whatever they came for, he made sure as hell they didn't get it. You gonna do the sendoff? Mm‐hmm. Tomorrow night. Bash? What I heard, it's eye for an eye. But it's, um... Something else. Joel? Mm‐hmm. Having trouble. His little girl... is growing big. That's why you're here. Gonna offer me a drink? Tea? Bit hot out, isn't it? Do you have a garden? It is a funny thing. You know, I grew up thinking my old man never had his shit together. Turns out, he can manage an entire farm of crop. And I can't even grow some fucking cucumbers. Well... Why here, Burt? You know, I don't care that you left. I didn't leave. I don't care what you've been doing the last couple years. I just wanna know... 'Bout done? Tea. There's a whole world you built back there. You don't come back, it's gonna disappear. He must be busy. It's like I told you‐‐ I didn't have to go in with you. I know that just fine. That guy... he called you Katherine. You, what do you think‐‐ What are you doing? - Be still. - What are you‐‐ These need to come out. Trust me. I was a field nurse in the Archipelago. Shit. - Which island? 37th. No shit, 37th. 37th was hell. Were you? Hell yeah. We were. 89th my first tour. Seventh mine. And then 64th together on‐‐mm‐‐both our second. You've seen some things. Damn sure I have. All right, deep breath now. Don't be a baby. You know, Monster Ring was Alvin's idea. Alvin? Wait. You're not Alvin? Oh, shit. I guess we haven't properly introduced ourselves yet. Earl. My name is Earl. But no, Alvin was, um... one of our platoon leaders on the Archipelago. He came home, took a look around, and... saw an opportunity. He also liked monster movies. Rounded us up and... there went the Monster Ring. You know, Bernice... she didn't always hate what I do. Used to love the income. But then one day, we woke up. Two kids with a baby. Before we know it, baby's a little boy. Little boy turns... 13, and don't you know it... 13‐year‐olds got a talent for listening to dudes they shouldn't listen to. Dudes like Alvin? Yeah. Dudes like Alvin. What happened? Um... One day... Alvin decided that it was time for my son... To go on a job. So they went... On a fuckin' job. My son didn't come back. What was his name? Your son? That man back there was my husband's brother. My first husband. Husband and brother made many people believe that I had betrayed them. Many people that I cared about. So why now, Dottie? Because it's almost our anniversary. Is that for real? Mm. At this point, isn't it all... for real? Raymond. My son's name was Raymond. Oh, David, I‐I‐I wanted to tell you for so long. You damn well should have, my dear. I tried. So many times, I tried. Just what do you propose we do now? We could run away. We'd run away from this place and never look back. We can't run, my darling. Not today. Daddy‐O said you're feeling sad. Did he? How are things out there? Sorry for that. Did what you had to. What did you do? Nothing, sweetheart. Strange thing, that... sack on his head. When I'm feeling sad, I like to hug Rufus. I hug him, and he soaks all the sadness out from my body. What you got to be sad about? Plenty. I'll be back to get him before bedtime. Uncle Bash? Hmm? What happened? There's no more peace for the owls. Let's go. Hey, what's up? How's the bike? Honestly, pretty shitty. But it's not her fault she's been mistreated by a bunch of lumberjacks her whole life. I feel her pain. You know, there was a weird clicking noise with the starter coil, so I switched it out, but no luck. Mm. Try tracing the wire back from the start switch. Look for any earths or intermittent breaks. Might need to run a heavier wire to the coil. Hmm. Worth a shot. Thanks. Gary's gone. They got him, uh, while he was at Murray's. I'm sorry, Gertrude. Nothing you can do. He was a dick anyway. Gary? Oh, you must be thinking of someone else. I've got a bad feeling about this, Meredith. A really bad feeling. It'll all blow over in a couple of weeks. It always does. Fights blow over. This was no fight. This is different, I can feel it. Even if it is, there's nothing that we can do about it, so... We could get out of here. My bike won't start. Yeah, but mine will. You remember what it was like back then. This is not somewhere you want to be when it gets bad. Then why did you become one? A Ghoul? Talked into it. I don't know, I mean, when it's all you ever know, well... you know. Hmm. Ever since I've known you, you've been talking about getting out of here. Let's just see how this all shakes out. Okay? What can I do here? - What can you do? - Yeah. You can keep the river running. You can protect it. That's what you can do. Some‐‐something was off about it. Percy's. - How is that? Ghouls wouldn't hit us like that. Well, it sure looks like they did. G‐Gary was an asshole, but he was also a coward. Big guy could barely fight‐‐ Yeah, and it doesn't matter, Matty. 'Cause here we are. Then I find out who. I find out which one of them Ghouls did this‐‐ And you what? Hmm? I‐‐I take care of 'em. And that solves what? Kill one guy, they surrender? Hmm? Ever since you've come here, Matty, been so eager for a fight. Then now that it's here, let me give you some advice. You just protect the river. And you fucking hope the fight doesn't ever come to you, because if it does, I promise you, it won't be anything like you think you're prepared for. You understand me? Long time, Agnes. Really long time. Your usual? Why not? It's good to see you, Burt. To time. Hey, Uncle Burt. Where's Bash? Percy was a good man. I always loved him like... he was one of us. He was one of us. Just always liked... doing things his own way. We're gonna make this right. Feels like I made it right. Now the Ghouls are just gonna keep coming. And that's why we're gonna hit 'em first. Definitely sounds like you're back. That all right with you? So? So, so. You were supposed to get control. The way you had control over Bash? It was Gary's drop. Ain't who Gary was. And Konstantinov? Said he had nothing to do with it. And you believe him? What else would I do? You could turn him over. Whether he killed Percy or not, I could give him to Burt. End the whole thing before it really starts. So he's back. It would appear so. I could give you every single one of my guys. Burt has his heart set on war? You and I both know... that means war. Besides, Joel... would you ever give up one of your own like that? If it ever comes between us. Well, wouldn't that be something? Other end of the fire, Joel. I'll see you there. Boys look good. Thanks, Burt. I hope you're ready. You gonna say hi? Hell is the point? You hate him. No. Just don't like weak. He ain't been around in my time, but... I have to say, I'm not impressed. Maybe Gertrude was onto something. Maybe I don't wait for Queenie to be done. Leave once, you don't get to come back. That's fine. Well... Daddy's girl privileges, right? You're fuckin' gross. I know. I've never cared much for funerals. Something made up by weak men to ease the pain of the lies that they tell themselves, that death has meaning. It does not. Family has meaning. You ever see a pack of wolves? The leader follows from behind. With our family, I've never needed to lead... or to follow. Because our family has always been one. And when someone threatens the family that we built, we need to protect ourselves... and make them suffer. So make no mistake about it. We are now at war! Yeah! Yo. Something's come up, something solid. I found a guy, can get us a load of scratch and then some. And we take it and we leave. 'Cause this shit going on right now, Meredith? Last time the Brawlers and the Ghouls had a fight, I lost my mother. A few times before that, my father. I've seen this shit. And it doesn't end well. We take it west. We sell it. We let all this shit blow over. Maybe we return. Maybe we don't. Okay. Tomorrow, our spot. Tomorrow. How does it feel, coming home like this? Can't say for sure. Funny thing about coming home ain't it, Dottie? It's never how you remember it. Um... it's what I'd like to speak to you about, Earl. I know you've said that I'm your meal ticket, which means you might not be comfortable with what I'm about to say. I have to leave tonight, alone. For your anniversary? Not quite yet. They'll all be quite distracted tonight after what we did. So there's a road, a road we could use. And I'd like to see if it's still there. And while I'm there, I have an anniversary gift I'd like to drop off. And what the hell are we supposed to do if you don't come back? I will. Hi. Hello. Are you a friend of Bash's? Uh... I guess you could say that. That makes us friends too, then. I suppose it does. I came for Rufus. It's his bedtime. Who's Rufus? Oh, okay. Um... Let me help. Here you go. You have the same tattoo as Uncle Bash. Can I show you something? Okay, just wait right there, all right? Ta‐da. Would you like to see it? You know what? I've been trying to find a name for this young man for a long time now. Perhaps you could think of something? Well... you know what I think? I think this is what Uncle Bash needs to make him feel better. Don't you? It was nice meeting you. Nice to meet you. I've been thinking a lot about Harold. Hmm, Harold. Harold Horpus, remember? You didn't have his story. Well, I have an idea now. Not a full story but an idea. I was wondering if he's like an ant who's lost their queen. Which would mean he'd lose the "why" in his life and he'd have to find it. Just something I thought of when I met the lady with the black heart and the yellow canary. The what? With Uncle Bash. His ghost visitor. You were dreaming. No, Daddy‐O. I was right there. Lyla. Do you remember her? A little. You're gonna take a break. Just a break. So you can think about Harold. Next time we see each other, you'll have his purpose figured out. And what are you gonna do? I'm gonna find my own "why." Lyla, sweetheart‐‐ I know. I know. It'll take some getting used to, won't it? Daddy‐O, stay well. And you don't have to worry about Harold. I'll find him. When you've had enough, you give us a call. You're doing that thing. What thing? Thinking too much. It was just something else, that's all. Burt, in the fucking flesh. Hearing him say those words, never thought I'd see it. Didn't it make it real for you? Made it something. Made what real? You heard what he said. War, man. Whether the Ghouls deserve it or not, we're fucking doing it, and this is our chance. All three of us. I like your jackets. Are you three part of a‐‐ a club or... Need something, miss? I, um‐‐ I didn't mean to interrupt. I just, uh... I noticed your outfits and... found myself curious. What is it that you all do? We're in transportation. Is that right? Like, um... like, uh, truck drivers? Yeah. We're like truck drivers. Hmm. Well, uh, I'm actually on the road myself. Which can be lonely, of course. I just think it's nice that... well, the three of you that‐‐ well, it seems like you have each other. Yeah, which is... well, like I said... it's nice. Nice to have people on your side. Well... I didn't mean to interrupt. I just, uh‐‐ just making conversation. You gentlemen have a nice day. Oh. Oh. Uh... Looks like you dropped this. Right, thanks. Well, it was lovely speaking with you fellas. You ready? Well, hello to you too. You're Burt's daughter, ain't you? I sure am. Number one daddy. He, uh... got you doing the dances, huh? Dances at his club. You know what I think? You know how to use that? I don't know how to use the slide‐y kind. This isn't the slide‐y kind. Okay. So look‐‐ Shoot her! Shoot her! Shoot her! - Jukes said alive! - Shoot her! Your gun's empty. And yours isn't? Was this always your plan? They didn't give me a choice, Meredith.
