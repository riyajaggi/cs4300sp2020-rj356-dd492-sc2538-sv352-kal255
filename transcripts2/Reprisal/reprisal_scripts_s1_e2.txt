 Night. Night, Doris. Good night, sweat pea. Sweet pea? What kind of stupid‐ass nickname is that? What are you, ten? Sir, last call was half an hour ago. I don't remember calling last call. And I'm looking at my glass here and I'm looking at a, uh, fucking sweet pea

 and I'm thinking it's pretty far from last call. I apologize, but we open again at 11:00. Bar and all. Nobody fucking asked you, princess. Hey. She said it was last call. Okay. All right. Fucking prick. You know, shit like this, it's why you work here. 73 cents and a Horn Bar. Shit'll rot your teeth. Hi, Ethan.

 You paid my bail? Why don't you hop in the car? It's chilly out. I fucked up bad, didn't I? I wish you wouldn't curse. Uh... Ethan, sweetheart, there's, uh... there's something urgent I need to discuss with you. I was just at the hospital not an hour ago, and it would appear that the police don't know that he's dead‐‐ not yet, anyway. I didn't even hit him that hard. Seems you hit him hard enough. And pretty soon, if it hasn't happened already, the hospital will notify the police, and then... Well... However... my friend Witt here, he, um, knows of some individuals, people who operate by their own rules outside of the law. He can get you joined up with them. What? Who? You'll only have to leave for a little while, and while you're away, I'm going to talk to some... Legal friends of Thomas'. And when you're there, it may be best if you don't mention my name. Witt here has a story you can give them to remain anonymous. The fuck? Ethan, sweetheart, I'm afraid this is your only choice. Here. Take this, okay? What is this? It's for anytime you may be too deep in the woods. You're a good egg, Ethan. We're gonna get you home soon. I promise. I didn't mean for him to die. I know, pumpkin. I know. Long time, Joel. Do you know this man? It's Konstantinov. He's a lieutenant. Your boys, the runners, they, uh, picked a fight with some of our guys. From what we heard, your guys won. Hmm, don't matter. Violation of our truce. They gotta pay for it. Turn 'em over to us, forget it ever happened. Turn 'em over to you? What for? That's up to us. But what is it you'd like to do with 'em, huh? Turn 'em into your fuck puppets? You don't turn 'em over, you risk a war. Does your boss know you're here? Does yours? Would you like Burt to know? Yeah. See, that's the problem with you Brawlers. All of ya, been on top so long, you've forgotten how far the fall is. You talk good. It's enjoyable to listen to, but‐‐ We respect the truce, and our boys will be punished. Can I ask you something? I grab you up. Like this. Look at your men. Look at them do nothin'. Nothin'. I can even... I can drag you... right in front of 'em. Right along here. And look. One. One will do something. You there. Will you do something? Maybe not. Do you... know... why... that... is? Because you all know, my brothers back there? You sneeze on me, and they do something. You know this. So you stand there. You worry too much. He... um, they‐‐they had an appointment. Your husband and Mr. Graham? Colin and Lander, yes. Do you know what this appointment was regarding? No. I... They, um... They always had plenty of business to deal with. It was nothing unusual. It's just been a lot. A lot to process with... Everything. Did you answer the door when Mr. Graham arrived? Yes. And were you upstairs when you heard the gunshots? Um... he was here maybe five minutes. They started shouting. That's when I heard the first gunshot, the second not long after. I got frightened, so I‐‐ I hid in the bathroom. I'm not sure what Colin was mixed up with, but... I find it sad. Sad that his business might have kept him from saying a proper good‐bye to his father. Mrs. Quinn, I want you to think very carefully about this next question. Are you positive it was Lander Graham at the door? Positive. Colin was not part of the plan. No, he wasn't. Been nice if you had told me. Have you made any progress? 'Cause framing a guy like Big Graham, it's not gonna go over just like that. Any progress, Witt? Look, if you'd asked me from the beginning‐‐ And I didn't. There's a guy in Indiana. He's cliqued up, from what I know. He's down to meet. That sounds promising. Now we just need to pick up Molly. Molly? Doris? Yes, dear? I know you said that‐‐ that leaving was what we had to do, but... are you sure? I‐‐I mean on‐‐ on such short notice? If you stayed... if we stayed, Big Graham would kill us, long before any trial they may put him on. Well, when‐‐when can we go back? We'll have you back home safe just as soon as we can. I promise. What about you? Because what you gotta remember, Hank... Fuckin' Hank. Fucking guy, right? Jesus Christ. I feel like I fucking raised you. Raised? Raised‐‐raised, you son of a bitch, you! And I'm not gonna sit here and let you bullshit me that the 7400 sprocket didn't leave your ass high and dry last autumn. Well, now, Lander, I wouldn't be so sure about that. Yeah, 7400 sprockets may as well have been a war crime. I need my leaves blown, not fucking scattered. And the 7400, it scatters. This is what I'm saying. The 7400 sends the fucking leaves back where they came from in the first fucking place. Right? You try to bullshit me last week, the week before that. I wasn't buying it then. I'm not buying it now. Oh, Lander's just uncomfortable that he's actually gotten to this place in life, with the leaf blowers and the lawn mowers and the sky trimmers. Looking out for you here. Yeah. With Molly's account, gets kind of tricky. I can buy us some time, have you out by morning. The fuck you saying to me right now? I'm saying they're framing you and I gotta put on a show, Lander. And by the way, I'm sorry for your loss. Four Ham Pies, one runny, for Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! Hello, pumpkin. What the fuck did you get me into? Sweet pea, you sound stressed. I don't need that "sweet pea" shit, Doris. Why the fuck am I here? Remember what we say about breathing. Yeah, I haven't breathed in two weeks, all right? I've been beaten up. We've gone across the country transporting fuck knows what. And today they almost turned us over to another gang because we got into a bar fight with them, and to be honest, I'm not sure they still won't. Is all that language really necessary? Doris! I need to go home. You know your situation. I'm gonna turn myself in. Fuck it. Was never gonna make it anyway. These things don't happen overnight. Lawyers, lawyers. What‐‐what happened with them? Did you‐‐did you talk to them? Who was the other gang? What? Today. They were called The, uh‐‐ The Happiness Ghouls. No one seemed to take them all that seriously, especially after this guy, one of the Brawlers, he kind of just choked one of the Ghouls out. Who? Name was, uh... name was Bash. Okay. Okay. You're gonna be just fine. I promise, all right? Yeah, all right. Is everything okay? Bash got in a fight with the Ghouls. Oh. I‐is he all right? I'd imagine so. Right. Who is... - It's fine, Molly. Who's Bash? Uh, I'm saying it's bullshit. There was a time Phoenixes used to be muscle. That's all I was trying to show him. That was long before your time, so ain't sure what there even was for you to show. Runny. You shameless slob. What you boys do, it gets repetitive. I mean, that much road will burn anybody out. Ugh. But you weren't around to see it get bloody the way it used to. I mean, things ain't been this kind of good in, well, all my time as a Brawler. That's why we all wanna keep it that way. So if anyone's gonna fuck that up, it best not be any of you. All Avron cares about is the shirt. How the fuck couldn't you guys see that? Don't‐‐don't need to worry about Avron. You need to worry about not pissing Joel off. Three of you are lucky he ain't making you walk the fucking gauntlet. Fuck knows with Burt clear off the map, he's got enough on his plate. This thing's disgusting. Mm. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to welcome you all. Welcome you... to the beauty of heaven... the wonders of hell... and the paradigm of all good fortune. Yes! Let me welcome you... To the trenches... to the holes of wrath, you hornblowers and bamboozlers, you... Sweaty swine of breathing membranes. Let me welcome you! Welcome you... to the Bang‐A‐Rang! - She shorted us this time. - She didn't short us. Seems short to me. You know that's 'cause you're an ungrateful bitch who's never satisfied. God, I fucking hate you. I hate you too. You know the drill. Cool and covert. Cool and covert. Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey! Give me another 22. I think you've had enough, don't you? I think that's my decision, don't you? Steady night. Steady. What's the matter? Strange today, right? The Ghouls. Little strange, guess. We don't like the Ghouls, Ghouls don't like us, but... to show up like that over a fucking bar fight with the Phoenixes? Ghouls been hanging by the same thread for a decade now. Well... You gonna tell Burt? If Bash made it worse, Burt would make it war. Son of a... Son of a... What is going on? Said there's no cable. But it's four walls and a room. You know, I best hit the road. I don't want anybody asking any questions. Do you have time for a coffee first, Witt? So you gonna keep her locked up in a motel room for this whole thing, you gonna let her go home? Can't let her go home, not until Big Graham's trial. You gotta quit. Do you actually know who Big Graham is? I know who he is just fine, Witt. Well, then you know that trial or no trial, that man is not going to prison. And when he doesn't go to prison, he's gonna come for you. After he kills Molly, long and slow, of course. What about Ethan? What about Ethan? You ever gonna tell the kid why you sent him down there? I just wanted to ask you about this meeting that you set up. That poor fucking kid. Look, he's a guy that's got guys. If you can convince him, those guys might be your crew. Anyway, um, it is Thursday. I will pick you up right here. Thank you. Okay. See you then. Wake up, little miss scoundrel. Can't you knock? Ha! Princess. When do I ever knock? Joel's pissed at you. Well, that's fun. Hmm. I imagine he will give you some shit. Which I will happily take. Hmm. Quite a collection you've built. Do you think any of them are her? I have told you this before, Meredith, but, um... I never really knew your mother. Except that she was a stuntwoman. According to your father, sure. Yeah, but it's not like Burt would actually remember anything anyhow. Isn't that right? Hmm. Just curious. Why? Why what? Why so restless? You think you'll find her? - Mm. You and Burt say my mother's dead, then... she's dead. What, then? Maybe I just really like the idea of taking a jump... and soaring. Well... in the meantime, let's just focus on our work, then, hmm? Did you know him? Saw him around a few times. A few sets here and there. Okay. You healthy? Feel well? Seems like it. And Lyla? Healthy. Curious as ever. Whole different view of the world. Ain't got a damn clue where she gets it. How 'bout Rita? How about you? You healthy? Got a cough I don't like. Comes and goes, mostly at night. Other than that... You don't come around much anymore. What's to come around for? What's to stay in your room for? Big wide world on those records. Lot of stories. Don't ever get bored? How many more times I gotta watch Pinups discover themselves? Tell you the honest of it? I miss it. The constant... uncertainty of it all. All that fighting. It was more than that. We‐‐we were validating ourselves. We weren't saying this world was ours. We were fucking showing 'em it was ours. Now we just drink with our dicks in our hands and feet on the stage and... got no purpose. We don't want war, Bash. Things ain't never been better. Remember that. Hey. Take care of something else with me? Wake up. - What? - Come on. Can't possibly be like this every day. - What, you don't like it? - Like what? This. The river, all of it. Yeah. Yeah, it's‐‐no, it's good. It's good. That shit scare you yesterday? With the Ghouls? Nah. No? Shit, it scared me, man. Thought I finally did it this time. Johnson, it scare you? Nope. Ole Johnson can't fear nothing. How do you know Witt anyway? Dude who dropped you off for Bru? His hair is made of yarn. Uh, he, uh... Dated my mother long time ago. She dated Witt? For‐‐for a tiny bit, yeah. So he's, like, your stepdad? No, come on. No, my m‐‐my mom, she, um... she used to own a speakeasy in Detroit. Met a lot of dudes. What happened to her again? Said she bailed? Yeah, she just... I was 15 or so. Said she was moving to Tucson. Told me I couldn't go with her, and... and then she left. Haven't seen her since. Well... You're on the river now, Ethan. With me. With Johnson. And you know what? That's all that fucking matters. Delightful. To the river. Hiya, sweetheart. Came to see us. It's nice to see you too, girls. Would y'all mind giving Bash and me a moment here with Meredith and Tina? Need you to stop. Joel, honey, it feels like we've had this talk before. Yeah, we've talked about this, and I've said the same thing over and over. And over. That toxic shit, it brings death. And we only get away with what we get away with. When we ain't the ones to cause it? The death. You think you're untouchable. I get it. But her? She's not. She's a bitch is what she is. So what you gonna do, Joel? You gonna beat it out of her? Be the big, bad Banished Brawler all you tall men are? Up to you. No. I don't think that's who you are anymore. You know? Because I think if you did that, all you would be able to think about the entire time is Lyla. Ladies, show's on in 15 minutes. What is happening here? Why, Joel... and Bash. What in God's fucking hell are we doing? Well, Queenie... Meredith here‐‐ Was just getting ready to go on. Her and Tina and the rest of the girls wasting my time in the fucking hallway. If you wanna talk to one of my Pinups, you gotta talk to me first; you know that. She's not just one of your Pinups, Queenie. She is if I ask her. What about you, Bash, honey? Anything you want to say to me? No, ma'am. Excellent. Bye, Joel. Gentlemen. All right, ladies. As much as I'd like to, we can't sit around all day. Let's get back to fucking work. I feel like... like I shouldn't have involved myself. You and I deserve the restaurant, Molly. It's ours now. We'll do great things with it. We just need to get over this hump. How do you know the man with the hair? The‐‐the one who drove us? Witt's an old friend. Were you having an affair? Sorry. I didn't mean to pry. Doris? - Yes, Molly? May I ask you a question? Sure, Molly. Had you ever killed anyone before? Not that I can recall. And how does it feel now that you can... recall? I don't feel much at all. They had the same laugh, you know? Thomas and Colin. I guess you always think you're prepared for someone to die. Then they actually do. That's Witt. We're going bowling. You're... going bowling? I'd invite you to come, but... Perhaps you should get some rest, hmm? Hmm. Hello, Grace. Condolences. Your brother‐in‐law was a very fine young man. I ain't seen Molly around. She all right? I hope so. Mm. Forgive me for asking, Mr. Graham, but are you sure it's a good idea for you to be here? I mean, you were‐‐ - Funny. Huh? She ain't here. What's‐her‐name, Thomas' wife, ain't here. And yet you stand around buying into all their bullshit. Ain't anybody thought about that? You think that looks okay? Would you excuse me? As your attorney, Lander, I... would not have advised you to be here. You didn't think I was gonna miss this, did you? No, I did not. Fucking hoity‐toity bitch. Man. I didn't see this coming. No one did. We gotta find her. I could leave tonight, but... you gotta tell me where they are. I don't know where they are. Well, then... meantime, you, my friend, can't go anywhere. Not until we get this squared away. It's your sister. Tell me you're safe. I'm safe. I made a mistake, Grace. Come home to me, Molly. Did he look healthy? What's that? Colin‐‐in his casket, did he look well? Casket was closed, sweetheart. Okay. Hello. Operator. Yeah, um, I'm sorry, Operator. I‐I got disconnected. One moment, please. Hello. Donuts & Duvets. Hello? Davie. I think I got a job for you after all. His name's Bolo? It's what he goes by. Because he wears a bolo tie. Sort of his signature, so yeah. Hmm. Look, Doris. This is your last chance to think about this. Think. You can't just walk in and ask a career fucking criminal and his career fucking criminal buddies to help you not only rob The Banished Brawlers but to kill Banished Brawlers. Uh‐uh. I hope you're gonna mention that little tidbit. Look, if you ask me, if you're gonna hire men to help you kill Bash and Burt... I'm gonna kill Bash and Burt. I just need the fucking support. How many times do I have to say it? Oh... I think you need to part with more of it. More of what? You married Thomas for the inheritance. Excuse me? You married Thomas for the inheritance‐‐ I did not marry Thomas for any inheritance. His passing doesn't make me a fucking rich woman. I am choosing to spend what little money we had outside the restaurant, and... and I am choosing to spend it on very selfish things. I know that. And I loved Thomas very much. And after this trip is over, I'll be able to move on. Okay. So look, Witt here, he told me the fee you're proposing, and, uh, I don't work with that. Well, that's all that I have. Well... it ain't what I take. And did Witt, uh... tell you? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll rob 'em, great. I could do that on my own. But I have someone... on the inside. No, I don't need a guy, okay? I've heard of The Banished Brawlers. They sound like a bunch of dopes. You see, it's all about the fee. Well, I apologize, but that's what I have to offer. Okay, let me explain something to you, little missy. You don't come asking around for something like this and then tell me what's what like we're just out here negotiating. The fuck I look like to you, a negotiator? I ain't a fucking negotiator. There's no need to be so harsh, Mr. Bolo. Oh, no need to be so harsh, okay. You know what? Fuck you. Fuck out of here. Forget it. Answer's no. I hope you get yourself shot a bundle of times over. And you, you pickle‐haired motherfucker, don't let me catch you in this fucking state again. Wasting my time with bullshit like this. Fuck. Oh, my goodness. Well, clowns, wish me luck. You see this? This is what I told you, hmm? These people are not just gonna say yes. I gotta take a leak. Let me see your fucking hands! Open it. - Not the register. - The door. What door? Oh, that door. Move, move, move, move. Hello, hello. Move, move. What's going on? Witt, you'll never believe this, but I think I may have just found our guys. Doris. Doris! Yeah? Could you open the door? Why? Everything's fine. Just, uh... could you? First! Hands! All of them! Second, nobody move, or these go off. You feel me on that? Show my man here where the cases at. Cases! Cases! Cases! No, no, no. There's four. We only have two. There's four.
