 What do you know about 'em? Not much, except they're called the Rusty Roses. No, wait, maybe... no, it's Red Roses. It's Rusty. What the fuck's a rusty rose anyway? They rust roses. What do you know about 'em, Johnson? They're prudish jokers. They'll fold. Cheers to that. Mm‐hmm. Are you gonna be all right for this?

 I am gonna be just right for this. Hey, what the hell is a rusty rose, anyway? Fuckin' roller skates. Little clown gang of rolling clowns. Let's get 'em, boys! No, no, no. No. Joel, you're gonna be okay. - Yeah. - Yeah? Rita, I think I'm in love with you. - Oh... - Yeah. And I you. Told you they'd fold. Strange place to pick. Figured you'd prefer quiet.

 Your hair is short. Beard's gray. And you look content. Yeah. Still get jitters like any other time. I move through 'em. Where you living? In a house. An actual house? An actual house, house. Couldn't imagine. Well, turns out there's a big wide world out here, Joel. Way over on the other side. You should see it sometime. Yeah, I've seen the world, Rita. And all that's in it. I know. Could come with me. You and her both. You know that. Could've told us you were leaving in the first place. Oh, is... is that what you've been telling yourself all these years? I left you? I tried to tell you I was leaving. God damn it, I tried. And even when I came back‐‐ - You knew the rule, Rita. Yeah, I knew the rule. But I didn't come back to stay. I wasn't ready. You are now? Is that why we're here? It affected me differently. Sorry, but it did. It wasn't the... the world I wanted. All right, then. Well, really glad you reached out. Fun catching up on old times. I was wondering, uh... what's life look like if... if Lyla came to stay with you? A while. Back and forth between us. What's going on? Times are good. But you're worried they won't be? What are you holding onto there, Joel? You still buying into the family bullshit of it all? Yeah, well... There is no back and forth, splitting our time. If you give our daughter to me, you don't see her again. That's the rule. Yeah? Ethan? No, he's indisposed. Who's this? Your mother called. Even though she's dead or whatever. Shit. You sound hungover. Fucking always hungover. That's not a good thing. Yeah, well, life on the river. Is that what they say? Good morning, Doris. Percy's Checkpoint. The barber shop. Yeah? The Ghouls, when do they make their next drop? I, uh... why? Why? I thought we talked about this, about you trusting me. Does that mean I can't know what's going on? Just feels like it might be best if I handle this. Keep your head clear. I think tomorrow. Think? Fine, I know. Tomorrow. Usually around 2:00. Around or 2:00? Call it fucking 2:00, Doris. Jesus. And the vault? Look, we're always on the road. We're gone for 11 days, we come back, Matty gives the money to Queenie. Where it goes from there, I'm not sure, but when I get back to 707, I'll see what I can do. Okay. Thank you. 2:00. You breathe well then, pumpkin. Yeah. So it's not the vault? Mm. Mm, it's different. Different how? Hmm... well, it's a step towards the vault if we get the tickets, but it's also something that could help us on a broader scale. So if it's not the vault, then... what is it? It's personal. You said you didn't need personal. The two of you don't have to go inside with me. I know it's not part of our agreement, and I respect that. It's just that I believe... that in order to succeed, we might have to sow some chaos. And it might get messy, but it will work. But again. We down here with you. So in a lot of ways, you're our meal ticket. Letting something happen to our meal ticket... the fuck be wrong with us? Ain't a goddamn thing wrong with us. We're with you, Dottie. And it's your turn to drive. But I've been driving. And you gonna keep driving. Is this... It's where Witt said. I don't care how good they are. You've only got two guys and a frightened housewife. She's no longer a housewife, but... yes. You're not bullshitting me? She really killed that fucking guy? She certainly did. Well, you know this just makes things worse with Big Graham? I mean... well, yeah, of course‐‐ of course you fucking know that it makes things worse, right? - You know what, Witt? - Because you... You're a fucking coward, and I'm growing really fucking tired of it. Oh‐‐oh, excuse me. I'm sorry, um... I, um, I actually‐‐ I asked for a tea. It's a coffee stout. It's a coffee stout. I have been up and down this fucking country for you for two years now. Which was your choice. - All I ever wanted‐‐ - Was to run away together. I know. I wanted to be your Bogie. Oh... Sweet Witt. If you had only paid attention, you would have known that this is what I needed, much more than you need companionship. It's not just that. If you pull this off, if you actually succeed... you'll be biting the hand that feeds me. You found me, Witt. I was enjoying my life, and you brought this all back to me... and it backfired on you. And I understand how difficult that must be. Joel's been riding my ass about finding something new, so‐‐ so I might be out of touch for a while, not that you ever needed me or anything. But... Witt... Don't ever think I'm not grateful. I only drink a little bit. I'm not that into it. Oh. Well, that's good. I just don't like to feel too loose, you feel me? Sure. Well, they‐‐they had pretzel cake and sodas... except I had to ask for the sodas, of course. First I saw you eat since I met you. Nerves, I guess. - Hmm, shit's normal. - The nerves? Hell yeah, the motherfucking nerves. I tell you what, you find perspective, you can put them shits to work. The nerves, of course. I'm not sure I want perspective. No, you need it. Gotta look within. The way he... He looked at me. Right after I hit him with that iron... he was so confident, like he knew‐‐he knew... He knew was going to be able to hurt me, and he meant to. And you took that ass apart. I took him apart. And I‐‐I don't feel the least bit bad about it. Which, then, makes me wonder... Does that make me a bad person? Tell you something. Human beings, outside Earl... I never much gave a fuck about. I don't know why, I just don't. Then I meet someone like you, I see the good... And it reminds me, I need to get my shit together. Being good can go a long way. Doesn't matter what you do or what you did. Shit might haunt you, but it prepares you. It prepares me for what? It prepares you to go through all this. Because you being you... that's enough right there. You could bet on that. Hmm. The salt on‐‐ on the pretzel cake... it's a nice balance. Hell yeah, it is. Hell yeah. You never told us about the guy you killed. Back where you're from. You did kill a guy, right? That's what you said. Yeah, something like that. Or something like that. We're just curious. I was, uh... I was working at this restaurant, and we were closing. A guy had been drinking at the bar for hours... started harassing the bar staff, so I... tried to break it up. And it got worse. Let me guess. You hit him first, right? And then you didn't stop. We already heard that part. It didn't make sense, man. The cops came, EMTs took him to the hospital. I, uh... I made bail. The next thing I heard, he was dead, so I got out of there. You regret it? Nah, you know what? I don't. I wouldn't be here if it didn't happen. - Fucking right. - Fucking right. Nice. Know where to start with that? I'm figuring it out. Gonna name it? She's already got a name. Pointy Apple. Doesn't count if you didn't name it yourself. Maybe she doesn't wanna be renamed. Well, if you're leaving it up to her, then... - Mm. - What can I tell you? Hmm. When you get her roaring, then what? Well... then she carries me as far away as she can. What would I tell Burt? You tell him I got tired. You've never been trapped. None of us have. You're safe here. Got everything you need. And nothing I want. Which is why... you want to leave. This world is just so tiny. You ever feel that? You know? That all of this is just... what? Home. It's home. I guess. Growing up, how did you feel about it? This place? You're worried about Lyla? Were you happy? You want me to tell you she'll be fine? That she's just gonna love growing up here? But you already know. This isn't about how she'll feel, it's... About you. Thanks for the beer, Joel. Want another one? Hit me. What is that? Necessary, I think. Molly. - Yes? I don't want you to take this personally, but you have to stay in the car today. Molly. What time you got? We should go. Well, there he is. Finally got that spanking you needed to get in line? Oh... Slow times as usual, eh, Gary? Thanks for coming by, pal. Gregory here and I missed you. Why don't you go fuck yourself, Percy? Morning and night, my friend. Morning and night. Oh, hello. Who is that, Doris? A man on a motorcycle, Molly. Well, all right. Even the tiniest battles can make the biggest things happen. And the great owl generals knew that when they waged their war. But not even the greatest of the owl generals could see that their ultimate betrayal would come from within, would come from love. Wow, short stack, that's, um... an interesting story. My point is, the day's almost over, and it's a great one to go owl spotting, and I'd like to invite you to join me. To go owl spotting? That's right. Uh... listen, sweetheart. Last night was long. I'm not sure we got the energy to, uh... yeah. The owls. Well that is unfortunate. Hello, Uncle Bash. You're supposed to knock before you come in. Well, it's getting late, and the owls are waiting to be spotted. There's owls in the woods? - Of course. How else would they get into my dreams? Good afternoon. You serve breakfast all day? This is a barbershop. Oh... well. I don't see any barbers. I see a cook, though. Well, barbers are off duty. And he ain't a cook. You wouldn't happen to have the time, would you? No, I would not. Because I happen to know that every morning at 10:00 a. m. a man named Percy Montgomery arrives here at work. That right? And I've heard that every morning, he sits right in that seat, and he eats his breakfast. Well... It's a lot later than morning, so... I think this seat might be free. Hello, Percy. It's been a long time, I know. I've been curious about you. Sitting here selling their tickets... And doing what else? Do you ever get out and see what goes on in their world? It wasn't right, what you did. You really, honestly believe that I helped the Ghouls ambush those poor men? Men that I considered my family? Why are you here, Katherine? Because I miss our talks. Which is why this next part... is going to make me very melancholy. Never... in this world... is he gonna... Is he gonna let you... Can you hand it to me, please? These them? Those are them. For decades, it was owl versus owl. Many owls. And other owls. And lots of owls were lost for good. Sometimes. And they all fought tiny battles over mice, because the tiny battles only led to the bigger battles, which is when it got bad. And when it was all finally over, the Great Owl King, Otto Olberman, was the one to unite them all. He reminded them they were all owls and none of them were mice. In fact, brought‐‐he brought the mice back to the fields for all the owls to have a feast. In my dream, I was one of the mice. The last of the mice. Sounds scary. There's one! Can you see it? Can you see it? I cannot. Must've flew away. It wasn't one of the generals, just a farmer, but still neat. So you were the last mouse? I was hiding at the bottom of a tall tree. Which is when Otto sent a dove down with a promise. If I left hiding, he'd spare my life. And did you leave hiding? Yes, but it didn't end well. Jeez. The owls... they went silent. What's going on? It's Percy. Get 'em, Bash! Get him!
