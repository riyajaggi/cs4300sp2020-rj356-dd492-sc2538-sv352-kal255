 You've grown tall, Katherine. Guess I've been gone long enough for you to grow. You know, our father... He was a bitter man. Bitter and weak. We may have been born with his name, but we damn sure are not weak. It's Mom's blood in our veins. It's her spirit. It's her name‐‐Harlow. That's who we truly are.

 Come with me, Katherine. Move beyond that horizon and come see the true family that I've built for us, where you'll be loved... Where you'll be home. I told you not to go out there, didn't I? So this is the place, huh? Not as gothic as I'd heard, but not bad. Mm‐hmm. Here you go. Just a little. I remember when he brought you to us. Said he gave you a choice, but... how the hell is a 12‐year‐old supposed to decide where to grow up...

 Especially after hearing your father beaten to death? I don't care how bad he was. No child deserves to hear a parent die like that. And even at such a young age, I could see a difference in you. Hell, you're his goddamn sister. I don't know anything fucking truer than that. Which is what I'm most afraid of. You're gonna want to come back here, and I'm telling you, Katherine, you just can't, because if he can do this... I'm afraid I don't know what comes next. Get out of here. Go away. Be happy you survived. And just know... your brother... Your brother will eat himself. I see it... one day, one way or another, if he hasn't already. Take comfort in that. When I take you to the station and you head up north... think long and hard about staying gone. But if you do decide to come back... You're gonna need this. And if I ever see you again... I'll be happy to tell you all about where it came from. Hey, get over here and help. I fucked up. I'm sorry. Always thought I'd do anything for the Brawlers. But Avron... He saw the whole Katherine situation and tried to turn it against us. Became a threat to us. And you saw that threat, and you said, "Fuck it." That's more of a Phoenix than I've ever been. What are we gonna do with him? Mm. I got a friend a couple hundred miles up the river. Alice? Alice. Alice? Hello. Hey. Hey. You okay? Sure. Yeah, um... That wasn't what I expected. Is that your way of telling me that I was right? I'm not sure you ain't ever been wrong before, Bernice. I just can't get what you said out of my head, you know, about me robbing and gunning it all away. And, um, some shit just went down out here. So... You're the smartest man I know, Earl. And something told you to follow her, and you did. You asked me to trust you, when trusting you's always been my weakness. There ain't nothing weak about you, Bernice. Keep following your gut, then, and I'll see you when you get home. He may or may not come around. I don't know. That was the place... motel last night. Think I had a run‐in with one of her guys. Can't say for sure, but... There's really someone sniffing around here for her, we got to find them... Now. Hey! Um, hey. Are you trying to get a head start today? Took it easy last night. What was going on? What, you... you didn't hear? About Katherine and Meredith? You told them where she was? I didn't tell them about you. What's that matter, Meredith? W‐what about when they put it together? You don't know that they will. You think if they find her, they're just gonna forget? Well, you've seen how much they drink. If my mother put me through hell, if she's the reason that I've always felt alone... then Doris was the one person that gave me hope. Hmm. It's why‐‐it's why I did it, without even questioning her... Because I trusted her. I've always trusted her. And then she used you. She used you. If this is your home... and you really feel like you belong here... Then maybe it's time to cut your ties. Good morning, Molly. Where have you been? I never asked you how it felt... That. You haven't ever opened up to me very much, really. Have you ever seen me open up to anyone before? I guess that's why Colin's family never knew what to make of you. Sometimes I don't think Tommy ever knew what to make of me either. What'd you really come down here for, Doris? To hurt some people. A few... Who I once loved very much... and who once hurt me very badly. Perhaps... no more than the one I was with last night. Is he dead? I'm not sure. I once asked you what it felt like to kill someone... when you killed Colin. And you said you weren't sure if you felt anything at all, and I.. I‐I didn't know what you meant by that. I‐I couldn't even begin to fathom it. Colin wasn't a good man, not in the least. I don't even think he saw me as another human being. And when I found out what was going on with him and you and the restaurant, I... Well, it's like you said... It was my idea. But when I heard him, when I heard him struggling, when I heard those gunshots... When I knew he was gone... I suppose... not everyone with a place in our hearts... deserves it. I'm glad you're down here with me, Molly. How the fuck that piece get there? Is that Lander Graham? Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. What a magnificent sight... if I do say so myself. Tolly, how you been? Last I knew, you were supposed to be getting locked up. Did I hear that right? You, uh, whacked one of your business partners? Little bit of why I'm here. Why? You need a favor? Because not for nothing, you and me ain't been friends for a while. You remember that, right? Is that right? You promised me just east of that highway over there. As soon as we set up shop, your goons came and shot 'em all down. Huh. Shit. I can't even keep up with my own fucking feuds no more. Tolly... I'm looking for somebody. Blonde... egomaniac. Okay. Part of me thinks this is a false lead, you know, but I want to say she wasn't in here looking to bowl, you know? The guy that used to run this place, fucking dipshit named Bolo‐‐ I even let him use his own dum‐dum name‐‐ he did mention something about a woman coming in looking for a crew. Not that he was able to do shit for her, but not ten minutes later, we got knocked over by the, uh... By the, uh, monsters? Monster Ring? Yeah, them. We got knocked over by the Monster guys. I put the fucking screws to Bolo, put the screws, to motivate the putz to figure out who they was, but... Nothing? He disappeared. I don't know if the craven motherfucker ran or what. - Hmm. - That's why I've had to deal with this family fun bullshit since, run the games we got in the back. We did track him... To a little landscaping shack. But we never seen nobody come or go except for this one woman that works there. Let me guess. She didn't know nothing, right? I don't know. I'm not interested in talking to her, so I haven't. Tolly... are you a fucking moron? Little bit. Your name, Flip? It's Lenny. Lenny. You remember me, Lenny? I think. Guy I was talking to last night... scar on his neck‐‐ who was he? A guy. A guy you've seen around? We don't allow smoking in here. Could pull his fuses. The woman with the blonde hair, who else she been here with? Look, man, I just‐‐ What the fuck? 'Cause if you don't give it to us, we're gonna pull your fucking fuses. - You understand that? - Fucking what? Okay. Look, look, look, look, look. Uh‐‐uh, usually, it was just four of 'em except, uh‐‐ Except? Lenny. - There's been some guy. He's got, uh, some hair and, uh‐‐and a shitty station wagon. He's been around a lot. It's Witt. Who the fuck is Witt? That birdman looks pretty neat. What do you think his name was? What was that, sweetie? What? The birdman over there. I was wondering if it was Harold. Maybe he came to tell me his story. Mm‐hmm. Maybe. Seat belts. Seat belts. Okay, everything is cool, 'cause they don't know shit. Just got to fight 'em, just got to play it cool. I can explain everything. Look, I was‐‐I was on the road. I was working... and I just came across her. I swear. I swear that's what happened. I s‐‐ Why didn't you tell us? I don't know. A good deal of our family are dead because of her and because of you. And the kid, he... What kid? Ethan. Let's see, we got Doris, Joel, Mom. I think I'm gonna guess Doris. He text you back? No, but like you said, - their schedule doesn't change. - Hmm. Hello, Witt. I see you go by Doris now. Where's Witt? Well, he's right where you put him. And that kid, Ethan... That was very clever, Katherine. Where is he? Weren't you worried that something like this would happen to him? Yes, I was. But you did it anyway. Now, that's a Harlow if I ever knew one. Dottie, what's going on? We just, um... We need to wait. We need to wait. Okay. Yes. Yes, masks! Masks! What the hell is this? We just want the cash. You... Let's go, come on. The trunk. Whoa, whoa. What are you doing with him? You follow us, it's his ass. Hi, Ethan. What in the world? It's a river. They know the river. We could cigarette‐burn your whole car, you know? We don't even care about the money. Shit, that little won't even get noticed. We'll call it a slow week and move the hell on. We just want our brother. Call 'em back later. You can't go with them. Ethan... Burt knows. No. You've been lying to me. - I'm‐‐I'm not lying to you. - The guy never died. I bought it at first, but I saw it when you said the lawyers were good to go. I knew it. It was too easy, too neat. - Ethan, I only did it‐‐ - You only did it for yourself. No. Ethan, Ethan, listen to me. Okay... I am not lying to you, not now. Burt knows, and you can go home. You need to go home. Anything that happens to me, Doris, it'll only be because you brought me down here. Lyla, sweetheart, come have some lunch. Lyla! Lyla? Well, this is nice. Did you know about him? Who's that? Ethan. I've seen him around. People saw you come back with him... that morning after Katherine kidnapped you. He didn't know what she was up to. He thought she was trying to help him, to protect him. But she lied to him. He doesn't deserve whatever it is you're gonna do to him. Well... people rarely have. How do you think she knew when the Ghouls were gonna make their drop at Percy's? Who do you think planted that bag of guns that she and her friends used to light this place up... and kill a good deal of your family? Now, I've put some Brawlers on the river to bring him back. And when they do... I'm gonna have him tell you himself. Come on. [trilling continues Come on, Matty. Call 'em back later. Hello. Is that you, Earl? Earl, my name is Lander, Lander Graham. Afraid you might know me as Big Graham. You and me, we got some business to discuss. Earl? Cordell‐- - Whatever you about to say, don't even say it. You better not think for one goddamn second I'm gonna let you go up there by yourself. Bernice is my family, too. So let's get out of here. What did we learn on the Archipelago? Split up if we have to, but what? Never leave a man behind. This is different. But it ain't, though. After all the shit we done been through. You know, maybe if we never said yes, maybe if we killed her in the first place‐‐ hell, maybe if we never stepped foot into fucking Bolo's... None of that matters now. And she got something she needs to handle, and she needs her team behind her. So after I get done handling Big Graham, you tell Dottie I'll be back in time to ask her brother why he did it. Katherine. Hello, Burt. How you feeling? I was wondering if you'd like to meet, you and me. What the hell? Well... they know. Know what? Johnson, know what? Ethan... know what? It's been me. This whole time, it's‐‐it's been me. What the fuck? What the fuck? Johnson? - Your call, bud. You know they're not gonna stop till we stop. I finally figured out Harold's story. Harold's been trying to find his face. His face? Harold's been trying to figure out where he came from, but it's been difficult because nobody can recognize him. Because he doesn't have a face. That's correct, daddy‐o. - Did he find it? - That's his story. Because it turns out, that years ago, he accidentally dropped his face in a park without realizing it. So he had to retrace every step, good and bad, a journey that he found to be quite horrendous, which is why I call his story The Horpus Horrendous. - I lit a match. - What? Seat belts. Seat belts. It's a funny thing, isn't it? Just how goddamn small this world can be. How many times you slick pricks robbed me, huh? Each time, impressive, got to say. I don't even know how you kept with the shit I was running back then. And yet, now... here we sit. Completely different set of circumstances. Earl... My man. Your wife seems like a nice person. You care about her... you'll take me to our mutual friend. You understand that? There's no one here. Why don't you two wait in the car? What? Fuck, no. Please. It's okay. Bash is alive. Bad shape but alive. To be honest, I had hoped so. I told you never to come back. Did you ever believe that I wouldn't? Huh. I told you that if you ever did, I'd tell you all about where that pistol in your hand came from. When, uh, I'd travel with the circus, small group of us, we'd... rob banks in the towns we were passing through. That's it. That's the story. I was a bank robber, and that's my old gun. Point is... I never thought I'd see you again, Katherine. I wish you hadn't come back here. Where's Burt? In the barn. The way he sees it, he figured you'd come gunning for him pretty early on. He wanted to give you a chance to think about his offer. You were wronged. You came back, started a bogus war, got a bunch of people killed in the process, and now you're here. And if you had anything anywhere else, you'd be there... not here. So he'd like to welcome you back in. Hmm. All you got to do is trust me. Give me our gun and go see him. What's he waiting in there with? Would I ever put you in danger? So you're blonde now? What did I tell you... the last time we saw each other about Mom's stren‐‐ I ain't been shot in a long time. I was wondering if I could have that back. That one belonged to my friend. It was nice to see you, Queenie. Oh, um... it's wonderful to be home. All right. Well... Let's make this right. Let's go find your girl.
