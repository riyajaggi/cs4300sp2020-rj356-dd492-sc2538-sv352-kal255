 This the place? I think so. Irma, honey. Can't think. Got to know. Then it's the place. It wasn't him, though. It was her, his wife. He just... he watched. Didn't help or nothing. See? What I been telling you? All right, let's do this.

 Yeah? Yeah. I want to speak to your wife if she ain't busy. Hey, Bear? Yeah? People asking for you. Hi, Bear. I was wondering what the fuck you were thinking beating up on one of my girls last night. Caught that whore tramping around my husband here. Yeah... well, they don't tramp, and they're certainly not whores. Your husband here commissioned a dance.

 You don't like that she's prettier than you, maybe you should take that up with him. And you... sitting idly by, and then you don't even have the goddamn decency to pay the girl. Tell you what. Why don't you take your wife here and move the hell on before the two of you get hurt? Fucking think about it, bitch! Get in the room! Hurts to get beat up, doesn't it? Maybe your fucking husband could watch this, too! Oh, for the love of fuck. I fucking told you something like this would happen. From now on, now the hell on, we don't let them work outside of the compound. It ain't always like that, Queenie. Never outside of the compound. What about her? Looks like you got yourself a daughter. It's the least you could do. Aw, what's her name? How the fuck am I supposed to know that? Could call her Meredith. My mother's name was Meredith. Okay, fine. Meredith Harlow. Happy birthday, Meredith. It's 100 fucking degrees outside. Meredith... Jesus fucking Christ. I told you to stay safe. - Am I not safe? What'd they want? Burt's daughter, man. The hell you think they wanted? We should go. I just got to use the restroom first. Hey, you all right? The faucet is the, um... pushy kind. Let me guess, your face is all fucked up, right? Like... like it's numb? Hands asleep? And my feet, too. It's because you're breathing all wrong. Feels like I'm stroking out. You're not stroking out. Here. Don't touch me. Okay, all right. Okay, just‐‐just look, all right? Meredith, just look. Plug your nostril. Come on. Plug your nostril, exhale everything. Inhale slow, count to four. Plug the other one. Yeah. Keep your eyes on me. Inhale four. Do it till you can feel again. Yeah? It only ever hits when things go quiet. Meredith, you should talk to Burt. No, Burt should talk to me. Hey, Burt? What? Can I come in? Where'd you get that thing? Laying around. Lying around? Never really been a fan of them myself. Unless you do hand‐to‐hand, ain't nothing settled. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you. Disappoint... Queenie says she's been speaking to you about that Scratch shit for a while now. You almost got killed. I didn't realize where I was. And I trusted her. Gertrude was my friend. She dead? Yeah. He also said that you were talking about... wanting to leave. More and more every day. Your life ain't good here? Wasn't yours? Leave and you can never come back... unless you're Burt Harlow, of course. With this, Meredith, doesn't matter ever how far apart we are. We're always gonna be Harlows. Always. I've never really been a gun person. Well, Molly, if you still want to come along, you're gonna need a gun. And what‐‐what am I supposed to do with it? If the moment arises... you'll figure it out. Mm‐mm, no. Not‐‐not that one. Can you drive? I‐I have a driver's license, yes. No, we mean more like getaway driving. That's what we need you for. Oh. No. What? Getaway driving is easy. Just crank the wheel, mash the gas, don't crash. See, Molly... there's a plan here. For you, it's all about the car. It's all about being ready. For us, we need our guns on the inside, but we need you on the outside waiting for us. And we can't go in from the back. So we got to go in through the front. But you? There's a road. A road I know. It can take you into the back. And we go in through the front. Wait a minute. What if they recognize you? It's the Bang‐A‐Rang. People have worn more ridiculous nonsense than our masks. We'll go in through the front and come right out the back. And when we do, Molly, you'll be waiting right there for us. Yes? Molly? Yes. I can getaway drive. Mm. Whoa. And what about our weapons? Yes. We'll need Ethan. Haven't had the chance to talk proper. Figured you were making your rounds. I can tell when I'm being avoided. Meredith all right? She'll be fine. I heard you took, uh, Lyla over to Rita's. Must've been tough. Old Man, I missed you. Lot of years. You used to only leave for a week or so. Weeks turned to months. Months turned into years. Why? I guess, uh... I got addicted to the quiet, is all. Wouldn't have stayed gone so long if, uh... If I thought you couldn't handle things. I tried... with the Ghouls. Offered to lower their tax. Queenie probably told you. Yeah, she might've mentioned that. Fucking Jukes... Old Man, don't beat yourself up about that. Ghouls have been a ticking time bomb since the day we had our first fight with them, whether you wanted to see it or not. Even if the Phoenixes never stepped foot in that place, we'd still be right here. There was never any avoiding this. All that matters now is that you never forget... what you're capable of. Joel the Mover. Fucking Ghouls. To make‐‐to make a play on Meredith, to go that far, what the fuck were they thinking? They're desperate. That's all it is. It's a point of no return, and it's our fault. Not our fault. You say you're not worried about her. Sure seem worried to me. What did we tell you about family around here? - I know, but you're acting‐‐ - No, no, no. She proved I didn't have to fucking worry about her, but that ain't‐‐but that ain't the fucking point. That girl's like a sister to me... to Johnson, to a whole lot of us around here. We don't like to admit it because she's a fucking brat, but that's... The point is the Ghouls are making it fucking personal this time. Meredith, Percy, fuck knows who else. There used to be a line in the sand... rules of war. But here they're... here they're taking cheap shots. Here they're fucking cowards. Ahh. This place... these people‐‐it's all any of us fucking have... including you. When we hit the river tomorrow, we're gonna make some adjustments. Detour through some Ghoul territory. And if we see any of them... well... we'll just go ahead and make it personal. Where are you going? Take a piss. What a sight for sore eyes. Honey, not exactly the greeting I was expecting. Don't worry about them. I can see that you're upset. Pumpkin, put the gun down. We can talk about all of this. He's bleeding. Molly, please. - Meredith‐‐was that you? - What happened to her? The Ghouls made a move on her. Was that you? - Of course not. Were you ever really gonna help me with my case in Detroit? Huh, Doris? I'm still working on it. Are you Katherine Harlow? I was. But that was a long time ago. They all think you're dead. Well, I suppose they're about to realize otherwise, aren't they? - Yeah. I need a favor. What? I have something important I'd like for you to hide in the Bang‐A‐Rang. This is bullshit. Ethan. Please. I can't do this without you. You really think he's gonna plant 'em? Absolutely. Yeah... Yeah. Look at you... out here all alone. Wanted to talk. Yeah. Wasn't us. Jukes told you that. He did. What, you don't believe him? Making a play on Meredith... was that your idea? Thought you'd get somewhere kidnapping Burt's daughter? Earn some stripes? I've earned my stripes. You think he's weak... Jukes. Maybe you ought to ask your pal Jukes whether he's been completely honest with you. I ain't going over his head, Joel... 'cause Jukes ain't weak. He just likes to keep his enemies closer than I do. So... what was your idea here, hmm? Figured Jukes ain't got his shit together, you'll come after me? We all kind of been thinking... this whole thing that happened, getting duped into a war... We've been thinking... it might be for the best. You know, when Burt came to me with the idea... I was confused. Kill our own brothers... didn't make sense. But in my gut... for all the horrible things we had to do to justify everything, there was... there was something I really embraced about blaming it on you fucking cretins. 'Cause I... I wanted war back then... The same way you want war now... Which is why... Johnson. Hey, Burt. You don't look a day older. Only in my heart. How's Alice? She's grown. Stays out at the swamp mostly. I stop by, see her when I can. She seems happy. Gonna need to hit the river with you boys today. Check out the other chapters... Tell 'em all what's doing these days. Might even stop by and say hi to Alice. You could say hi to Alice. How long you been around now? Um... tell you the truth, I'm not even sure anymore. It's funny how that happens. What brought you out here? He's on the run. - From what? - Murder. How do you like it? Being a Phoenix? It's good. Good. You should be proud. They explain to you what it means to be a Phoenix? Yes, sir. Told him we're the lifeblood. Except now people just see us as errand boys. You're not running errands. You're helping us thrive. And you put your time into that... And I will give you everything you've ever missed out on in life. What's up with the masks? Trick or treat. The vault, open it. Move, move. Vault's empty. The vault's empty. The vault's empty, Dottie. Accountant, why is the vault empty? What the hell are you three supposed to be? Afraid we don't allow weapons in this establishment. Where is it? - Wait, don't. Don't. - Shit. God damn it, wherever the alarm is, she about to sound it off. We just have to avoid the bar room. We can get to the back unnoticed. Zombie, what did we learn from the Archipelago? Shit get hot, you got to split up. - Split up? - Split up. We got to split up, Dottie. We're gonna talk about this later. Split up? We're getting robbed. - You're doing it wrong. - Shut up. No, Tina, honey, look. I thought you didn't know how to use the sliding kind. This is the bolty kind. Tina, take the home hall. Cutesie, take the road hall. Devil, take the long hall. Butterfly, take the card hall. Reaper, take the smoke hall. Jonesie, take the bright hall. And, Meredith... You take 'em all. Hey! Aah! You're blonde now?
