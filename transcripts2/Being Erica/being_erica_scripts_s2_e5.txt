 Being Erica (2009â€“2011): Season 2, Episode 5 - Yes We Can - full transcript 
 Erica's life seems to be bound by rules and conventions, rather than acting on what may be deep in her heart. Ethan has just moved in, yet he feels threatened by Erica's relationship with Kai. Erica, with Ethan in tow, needs to do some research for her sex book at a bona fide sex club, where many social rules are broken. To allow her to feel what life is like without these conventions, Dr. Tom gives her the entire day again, this time how she wants it to play out. The only thing that will exist on her day after the fact is her memory of it. So she lets loose, and spends much of the day with the only person who can really appreciate it, Kai. Erica learns that even though nothing during her day is real, it feels like it's real - the good and the bad - and that she'll know what others truly believe and think after the day is over.

 Previously on "Being Erica": Stop being wishy-washy and tell me what this sex book should be. It's a fast-paced compendium of how to have sex-- with who and how, from vanilla to tiger tail. Hi-ho, Strange, away! Do you really want to move to London? It's an amazing opportunity. For Josh. But what about you? Just got back from '92 the other day.

 The air is cleaner there. Wow, you really don't wanna talk about therapy, do you? Sounds like I'm moving in? Well, it doesn't actually make sense for you to be paying rent next door, not when you're spending every night here. Welcome home, baby. Ugh! What is in here? What? Oh, ok. Yeah. High-five. No way. Ethan, you cannot put that there.

 What're you talking about? Why can't I? Because... "why can't I?" It's a question that never goes away. Our whole lives are spent chafing against the rules, pushing back the boundaries, trying to find a loophole. Oh, come on, the beanbag chair, it's way too big for the living room. It's old, and it's falling apart-- It doesn't match the couch. "mine" becomes "ours" the second you cohabitate. Learn to love the beanbag. Thank you, Kai. That's very helpful. Thank you. Thank you for showing the love. And now, here to charm you with his dulcet tones, Goblins' own Kai Booker. Whoo-ooo! What're you doing? I told you. Come on. Come on, everybody. Whoo! Yeah! Right on, right on. Wow! Did you know he could sing? No. ? I know what you're feeling ? ? it's hard to believe in ? ? their home must be millions and... ? ? billions of light-years away ? ? so let the stars align ? ? let the water make wine ? ? 'cause broken souls will become whole tonight ? ? oh, tonight ? ? you know it's right, so... ? ? lift your eyes and let me in ? ? 'cause, baby, I'm an alien like you ? ? will you ever wake at night and realize ? ? the reason why you knew me then ? ? 'cause, baby, I'm an alien, too ? ? will you ever let me be ? ? an alien ? ? with you? ? Whoo-ooo! Yeah! Thank you. Thank you. Well, cheers. Cheers. Cheers. I have to get some air. I'm just gonna go tell Kai how amazing he was, ok? I'll be right back. Oh. Ok. So... You can sing. You sing really well. Thank you. Kai, it was incredible. Why didn't you tell me you're a musician? Are you in a band? You know, a barista by day, rock star by night? Ok, we can't talk about therapy. Singing is a non-starter. Uh, what can we talk about? Latte art? Fine. What do you wanna know? You start off with the orange veggies. Yeah. You know, like squash, carrots, sweet potato, stuff like that. It's like a system. Great. Hey, do you want me to go get her? Oh, um, no. No, it's ok. She'll be back soon. What is the big deal about you telling me your doctor's name? There is no big deal. I just don't wanna. Oh my God, you are so annoying. Ha. Well, my 15 minutes has turned into 20. I gotta get back to work. Of course you do. Honestly, I don't understand why everything has to be such a secret with you. Hey, guys, what'd I miss? The entire evening, apparently. Um... How about we go settle the bill? Yeah. Yeah, ok. You're mad. You were gone for 20 minutes. So? I was just talking to a friend. Oh, you mean, Kai, the 22-year-old barista? Ok, wait a minute, are you mad because I was awol, or because I was talking to Kai? Well, Ethan, what do you want me to do, just not be his friend? That'd be a good start. Over and over, we resist any attempt to box us in, to curtail our freedom. We ask the question, "why can't I?" And when the answer comes back, we never like what we hear. ? Being Erica 2x05 ? Yes We Can Original Air Date on October 20, 2009 ? it's clearer inside of me ? ? who I will always be ? ? open me up to my heart ? ? feels like I'm seeing in the dark ? ? waking me up to my heart ? ? to do it all over again and again ? ? until the end ? ? the sum of my dreams ? ? and everything I ever wanted to be ? -- Sync, corrected by elderman -- -- for www.addic7ed.com -- I almost broke my neck. What? Your beanbag chair, it attacked me. Why is it in the middle of the bedroom? Uh, 'cause it's not in the living room. Hey. Oh, you look tired. Thanks. I am. Kinda hard to sleep when your boyfriend is mad at you. Ok, here's the thing. I... I don't get your friendship with Kai. People in relationships-- what, they can't be trusted to be friends with someone from the opposite sex? Look, get your morning coffee from him, talk to him while you're waiting in line. That's cool, but anything else, and-- Ethan, I'm not Claire. Exactly, because Claire would pull that kinda shit on me all the time. Fine. Thank you. He didn't actually say, "you can't be friends with Kai," but clearly what he meant was-- you can't be friends with Kai. But why?! I mean, it's crazy. Is she from your mom's group? No, no, I just see her around sometimes, and her kid looks about the same age as Max, so... Well, you should go introduce yourself. You can swap... I don't know, sleeping pills or notes, or whatever you new moms do. I don't even know her name. Really? I can fix that. Oh, Erica, don't! No, no, that's... Weird. Wow, you sound like Ethan. He's threatened and probably just a little bit jealous. That's all. But why? I haven't done anything wrong. Judith, Kai-- Kai is just a friend. I know, but it's... It's just one of those things you can't do. Oh, come on. I was friends with Ethan for years when he was married to Claire. Exactly. And who's Ethan with now? So, are we going to Goblins, or what? Actually, I feel like Starbucks. All right. So, that is the resume of Nicole Clarkson. She has her master's in couples and family therapy from the University of Guelph. And I read this fascinating article that she wrote about how sex has gone from a physical act to a legal one. Bah! I'm bored. Where are we on titles? Um, ok, just spit-balling, but I do have a few. "let's talk about sex." ? baby... ? 'cause...Um... "hot under the collar." "the we spot." The last one was a joke, right? Um... There is a "disconnect going on here, Erica, between what you pitched, what we want, and what you're presenting. Yeah, in english it's a pile of shite. You came to us with this fresh concept-- 31 flavors of sex, from vanilla to tiger-tail. masturbation to pony play. We want a book that's transgressive, one that pushes all the boundaries. Yeah. So, stop being a prude and make this title more raw, Erica, more basic, more animal, more, more... Bang! Pow! You got it right there, right there. Pow! Right there. You see that look? Pow! You see that? That prudish look is what's holding you back. Ok, what if I had, uh... Meeri set me up on an interview with, like, uh, a dominatrix? Delicious! Good, great. Maybe a madame? No, no, no. I mean, "Delicious" the club. The sex club. Downtown, where anything goes? Yeah, go there, Erica, tonight. Broaden your mind. Find someone who lives and breathes sex. Absolutely. I am on it, tonight. Delicious. I'm sorry I can't take you two to the airport tonight. Erica, it's fine. Work's work. Well, going to a sex club doesn't sound like work to me. You better keep an eye on this one, Ethan. The last thing you want is for her to nibble on some forbidden fruit. Don't worry, I'll be right beside her. Still, I'd, uh, keep her on a leash. Shh. What? It's a sex club. So, Sam, what part of London are you gonna look for a flat? Well, it's a huge city, and there are some really cute parts-- West end, period. Still, if Sam's gonna be the one that's stuck at home-- The west end's great. There's theater, stuff to do. You know, for when you come and visit. Right. So, is everyone done? Yes, darling. I'll take your plates. Thank you, mom. Thank you. Mmm. All you need is a french maid outfit. I'm good, thanks. You know, London will be good for Sam. Take her out of her comfort zone. I mean, uh, she practically lives here. Maybe that's because we're her family. Uh-huh. And I'm her husband. Come on, Erica, I know you wanna say something. Go ahead. Go on, go on, go on, enlighten me on my own marriage. Put your nose where it doesn't belong again. Josh... Yeah? Hey, Erica? Your mom wants this wrapped up. Great. Thank you. Well, I'm ready for dessert. Anybody else? Barb, you want to satisfy my sweet tooth or what? Hey, what's going on? I swear that he's pushing my buttons on purpose. He's trying to get me to react so that I say something I regret-- And it's good you didn't. Good? You minded your own business. It was the right thing to do. Look... Let's get outta here, ok? Let's go home and get ready for our big, weird night out. ok. Thanks. ? now's the time for you to let go ? ? of all your inhibitions... ? ? we can do this one more time ? Uh, okay, what the hell was that? Trust me, you don't wanna know. Come on. Let's go do some research. Okay. ? crawl over you ? ? I'll dominate your destiny ? ? I'll be your faith I will be your fantasy ? ? let me ride to heaven ? ? let me feel the swelling ? ? Oh let me concentrate ? ? I can feel it ? ? when I taste ? ? like the wind I breathe ? ? crawling inside of me baby ? So, wow, 10 years? Really? Yeah, 10 years this August. Congratulations. And so... I mean, all of this, It doesn't cause a problem in your marriage? The reality, is our marriage is more open than most people's. More open sexually and emotionally. But I don't hide anything from Gloria. She doesn't hide anything from me. We're always completely honest with each other. Mm-hmm. So... I mean, what can you be jealous of? That you're having sex with other people? Sex is completely natural. All these rules around it aren't. And you don't think that they're there for a reason? Gimme a good reason. I mean, one that doesn't involve religion or morals. I just--I just don't think I could do it. There's only one way to know for sure. Hmm... ? you licked it ? ? until y saw me roasted ? ? the moment you break me ? ? I'll say it simply ? ? shut up and listen... ? Join in anytime. Ok, let's go. Ethan. They wanted us to have a foursome. I've never even had a threesome. Oh, well, they're overrated. I'm joking. Oh my God, you're really freaked out, aren't you? I just find this all very weird. ? words on the tip of my tongue... ? It doesn't turn you on? ? that's just for fun... ? Not even a little bit? What're you doing? Being bad. You've never wanted to just be bad with me? Hmm? ? why don't you give up this mission ? ? shut up ? ? and look at me ? ? I'm just a Stranger ? ? you left, you think I'm just a Stranger ? We have an audience. Ethan, we're in a sex club, They've seen worse. ? shut up... ? Erica, really. Ethan, just kiss me, ok? It's not a big deal. Well, it is to me, so... Please, can we just-- can we just go? Ok. I'll get our jackets. ? look at me, I'm just a Stranger ? ? yeah, you know I'm filthy ? Dr. To-- oh, my God! Do you want me to give you a hand there? No, please, you just stay right where you are. What's the matter? I am. You're naked. Why do you think that bothers you so much? I can honestly say that tonight has been one of the weirdest nights of my life. Yeah? Well, please, have a seat. Bare your soul. Uh...Ah... Ok. Let's see here...Ok. I have never seen people have sex live... before tonight. And they just had it all hanging out, you know? Their kinks and their... bits and pieces and... Yep. And you didn't run away screaming, though, did you? All those conventions and taboos being broken in one room. Well, at first, it was shocking and... but then after a while, I don't know. It... It kinda seemed like... "normal" is not the right word, but... like that couple. They cheat on each other all the time, but they seem way happier than my parents ever did. Maybe they have it right. "nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal." Albert Camus. Take Ethan. We were kissing, and a couple people stopped to watch, and it was too much for him. Yeah, well, maybe Ethan prefers to be affectionate in private. Or he's hung up on the rules. Like I can't be friends with Kai. Hmm. Why should I have to turn my back on the only other patient I know because what, he's a guy? I mean, that's-- that's insane. Right. I'll tell you what-- Let's do a little experiment here. It doesn't involve you standing up? Uh, no. Today, this session is not going to be about a regret. No? No. Ok, so, from the moment that you woke up until right now when you came through that door, I'm giving you a daylong do-over. Ok? Nothing will stick, and everything new will be erased. Really? So, everything I do today, it can be undone? Well, not only can be, it will be undone. Except, of course, for your memories. So, just go back and do whatever you want. Rules be damned. Go jump out of a plane or gamble away your life's savings. Walk around naked? Yeah. See, now you got it. You've spent all day today being bound by the rules. Well, why don't you try going back and reliving today without any. Oof! Oh! Erica, what the hell? We need to talk about last night, and it can't wait. Look, I know that you don't want me to be friends with Kai. I never said that. And I know that it's because of Claire and how she cheated on you and she hurt you. But Ethan, I'm not Claire. I know you're not Claire, ok? I'm sorry, you and Kai as friends, it's-- it's what, it's weird and unconventional? I mean, maybe, but why? I don't know. Look... Kai is a friend, and that friendship will never get between us. Ok. Oh. Look at you. You're all clean. That's too bad. Why? Oh, because... once I'm done with you, you're gonna have to take a shower all over again. Oh. Wow. Whoo-ooo-ooo! Oh, my God. Erica! What the hell has gotten into you? Excuse me. Erica. Eri--oh, my God. I'm sorry. Can you please stop that? Now? No, I will not. In fact, I think you should join me. Oh, sorry. She's just a bit happy today. Good for you. You made first contact. Now go talk to her. Erica, no. Judith! Hi, there. I'm Erica, and this is Judith. Hey. What's your name? Saadia. It's a beautiful name. And your son, he's adorable. What's his name? Hasan. How old is he? Uh, 6 months last Tuesday. Yours looks about the same age. Yup, 6 months next week. Listen, it was really lovely to meet you, but I have to run. Ok, um... I'll call you later?! I will see you later, alligator! Yeah! You charged me 5 bucks for milk bubbles?! It's no prob. I'll make you another one. Excuse me. Hello. I really can't talk right now. Have you ever seen that movie "Groundhog Day" with Bill Murray, from the early nineties? When I was 5? No. He gets to live a day over. And it turns out, my therapist! Is doing the same for me. Erica-- Whatever, Kai, they're not gonna remember. Really? You get to redo today? Oh, no, I am redoing today. Everything I do for the rest of the day doesn't stick. Kid! I'll just be a sec. All right, so say I believe you, and your day really is gonna be erased, if I'm by your side? Everything I do with you, it's undone. I mean, why do you think I came here? You're the only person I know that can truly appreciate this. If I get a ticket, ok, It's coming right outta this tip jar. Yo, moby dick, why don't you tone it down? Excuse me? You're 100% sure your doc's not pulling your leg? Oh, yeah. And you wonder why you're slinging coffee at your age? Now that's a $5 dollar latte. So... Are you ready, You big rebel? Oh, yeah, I'm pretty much fired, anyway. Hello. What kind of trouble should we get into? Uh, what're do you doing? My favorite customer left his keys on the counter. Let's call it a tip. Let's call it "grand theft auto." forget it. Erica, the first rule of do-over day is, there are no rules. Uh... I swear, if I spend the rest of the day behind bars, I'm never gonna forgive you. And I'll never remember. Hop in. ? oh, the boss is coming... ? Mercedes-Benz! CLK63 AMG. 475 horse power, 0 to 100 in 4.7 seconds. They do not make cars like these anymore. Anymore? This thing, it looks brand new. Look at you, enjoying the perks of therapy. It's not all bad, huh? I never said it was. So, then tell me your doctor's name. Oh, come on, Kai, you're not gonna remember. Fine, it's Doctor Fred. Oh, great. Look, I'm late for work. Last thing I need is to hear my boss bitch me out. So, why don't you go do the bitching? Oh... Oh, yeah. Whoo! Good morning. A good boss is a calm boss. A good boss is a calm... boss. Hellooooo! Oh. Uh, since when is coming to work 2 hours late ok? Who the hell do you think you are? Oprah? I was on "Oprah" once, and, uh, "Dr. Phil." Where the hell have you been, Erica? I have been with Kai, my 22-year-old friend. He can sing, and as Meeri would say, "he's righteous." What? What the hell is going on with her? In chapter 5 of "The Mystery of Tomorrow," it states-- Wow, it's not even published yet, and he's quoting himself. Your self-love, it has no bounds, does it? Erica-- Julianne, Let me "break it down" for you. This man is a dog. He turns you into a giggling idiot. It is embarrassing, and you can do better. And you! Huh! You need to get over yourself, seriously. "The Secret of Now" sucked! Who... Oh. I gotta run. Hey, you. Hi, there. Uh...Yes? Um, I know that we've never actually met, but I've spent the last year admiring your ass. It's truly spectacular. Um... I'm married. Oh, totally. I'm with someone, too. I was just wondering if you'd mind if... Wow. Bye, everyone. See you tomorrow. I think you're hot! You think I look hot? Totally smokin' hot! I feel like the gayest cowboy since "Brokeback Mountain." thanks. Hey, it wasn't my idea to play "truth or dare." Today of all days. So, what's it gonna be, partner? Erica... Truth or dare? It's your turn. Fine. Truth. Really? Finally. Why won't you talk to me about your therapy? 'cause I did something in my past I wanna forget. That's not really answering my question. I mean, in my experience, you can't just avoid your regret. If it's on the list, the rule is, you have to relive it. What is it you're trying to forget? You don't get 2 questions. Ok, no, no, no. I'm not playing the game anymore, Kai. Just... I'm asking you as a friend. Someone died because of me. You know, Kai, they're called regrets for a reason. No judgment here, ok? Ok, well, you owe me now. Truth or dare? Dare. All right, I dare you to face a real fear. Do something you always wanted to do, but can't. How fast do you think a Mercedes could get us up to North York? Depends who's driving. Yeow! Erica? Honey, is that you? Where were you? Why didn't you call? Meeri said you left work hours ago. Uh, you know what? Why don't you guys go sit down, and I'm just gonna grab something to eat. And I will promise to explain everything to you. Oh, good. My favorite. Thanks. Nice work, Erica, Freaking Ethan and Barb out. Sam, too, not that she showed it. Mm. And how would you know that Sam's upset? Because I know Sam. You know Sam. We're married. Oh, yeah, you probably blocked that out, since your maid of honor speech was something like, "oh, dearest sister Sam, please don't marry that asshole Josh, 'cause he doesn't love you. Hugs and kisses, Erica." Right? Well, you don't. I know that. Mom... finally starting to figure it out. Deep down inside, Sam knows it, too. You don't know shit. Look, Josh, I'm not here to point fingers or to attack you. Really? Yeah. But there is something that I need to say. Oh, I cannot wait to hear this. Dragging Sam off to England, It's not gonna fix something as broken as your relationship. "dragging" Sam? She wants to go. Are you sure? Have you ever even asked her? Because I think she's going only for you. This is none of your business. Actually, yes, it is my business, because she's my sister. And you, Josh, I've known you, what, since you were 14? You're 30 now, and you still don't look happy. I want my sister to be happy. So, please, go and do the right thing for once in your life. Erica, something's wrong. They've locked themselves in Sam's bedroom. What did you say to Josh? The truth... What we should've told him, them, a long time ago. Mm. I'll get it. It's the end of the world as we know it. Indeed. It is. Hey, did you realize that by the end of this century, our planet will warm by more than 6 degrees? No. No, that's not what I meant. I meant in here. Sam and Josh, they're finally having "the talk" About their relationship. I did the thing that you're not supposed to do-- I meddled, and... fingers crossed, the logjam has burst. "to succeed in life, you need 2 things: Ignorance and confidence." Mark Twain. I'm tired of holding myself back because of the "rules." Great. From now on, I'm gonna do and say Exactly what I want. Good, good. You only answer to yourself in life, right? You know, every man for himself. You know...Right? Uh...No, That's not exactly what I mean. Listen, Erica, do you think all those SUV drivers out there stop and worry about anybody else as they're pumping tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere? Hell, no! And they look happy, right? You know, kinda. You just go for whatever you want, you know, when you want, and everything else will just-- Whatever. It'll sort itself out. Ok, I'll see you later. Hey, enjoy. It was, uh, it was no one. I'll put the bags in the car. Honey, are you ok-- You think that I'm making a mistake. You think that I'm following Josh, That I'm too weak to stand up for what I want. We're just worried. Erica, you are the last person to tell anyone how to live! Ok? Sam-- no! What makes your life so perfect that you can constantly do this to me? Erica's finally got a real job and a real relationship, and isn't she so wise now that at the age of 32, she can actually pay her rent without anyone's help? You are so arrogant. You think that you can just say anything that you want to me, to Josh. You are constantly ripping apart all of my decisions! I want to move to England. I want to get me and my husband as far away as I can from you! Sam... Josh, I-- would you shut up? You don't give a shit about me, you never have. Did you even think about what this would do to Sam? Ethan, I don't need a lecture. Or did you just plow ahead and say, "hey, screw the consequences?" I did this to help her. Yeah, well, clearly Sam doesn't need or want your help. Hey, Erica, everything ok? What is he doing here? Oh, my God, this is a nightmare. Oh, I see. You didn't go to work, you didn't call. You spent the day with him. Ethan, really, everything's cool. Kai, please, just don't. Ok, Ethan, I know what this looks like, but that is not what's happening, ok? Kai and I-- just friends, right? No. Yes. We're just friends. We're not even friends. We're actually-- You're what? What, Erica? We're time-travelers. And I know that that sounds crazy, but it'she truth, ok? Uh, look, last year, I told you that I went to the hospital after I ate that hazelnut frappa-thing, right? Do you remember? And then I met this therapist, and I-- I know this sounds insane. Insane? That you and Kai travel through time together? No, not together. Separately. Well, I am the last guy to stand in the way of that kind of a friendship. Ethan, please, I am telling you the truth. Ethan... Look, Erica, in a couple hours, this'll all be erased. What went down tonight wasn't technically real. Yeah? Well, it felt pretty real. I'm never gonna be able to tell him about therapy, am I? Kai, you're the only person I can talk to about this. You in the Mercedes, step out of the car, please. ? oh, the boss is comin' ? ? you better look busy ? ? they aren't paying you for nothin' ? ? there's no time for lovin'... ? what? Seriously, the cop will hear you. This is the weirdest 24 hours of my life. We stole a car. We're running away from police. I mean, who am I?! None of it matters. This is your do-over day. Today, we get to do whatever we want. No. I can't believe I just did that. No, I kissed you. Why? 'cause I wanted to see what it would be like. And so did you. ? lift your eyes and let me in ? ? 'cause, baby, I'm an alien like you ? ? will you ever wake at night and realize ? ? the reason why you knew me then ? ? 'cause, baby, I'm an alien, too ? ? will you ever let me be ? ? an alien ? ? with you? ? Erica! Look, Ethan, I'm just gonna go to bed, ok? No. You do not get to just walk out of this! Do you know what you put me and everyone through today? I'm sorry. Erica, please, just talk to me, ok? I...I can't. Just be honest. Tell me the truth. What did you do today? I... Oh, God. I promise you that I'm done being insensitive, ok? And... And... selfish And... and just awful. It's ok. No, it's not ok. Ethan, I hurt you... and I made you worry. I love you... So much. I love you, too. Uh... What did you do? Oh, my God. Ethan... ? you know I'm filthy ? ? shut up and listen ? ? why don't you give up this mission ? ? shut up ? ? and look at me... ? Erica, I'm right here. Hey. Are you ok? Can you just take me home? Of course. Well, that was an interesting night. Hey, listen, I promise by tomorrow I will have all of that put away. Oh, don't worry. I'll help you. We both live here now. We do. Look, can we talk... about the weirdness this morning? No, that was all my fault. I let my issues with Claire turn me into a crazy man. You had a right. No, I didn't. Like you said, you're not her. You could never do the things she did. Hey. Be friends with whoever you want. I trust you. Mmm. All right. Where to begin. It sends the wrong message. What? That you have a killer figure? Friedy... Are you serious? There she is, our little sex tourist. So, how'd it feel to take a walk on the wild side? Um... Uh-oh. I smell "disappointment" with a touch of "desperation." what gives? I didn't find any inspiration, and I don't think that I will-- not with the direction that we're taking the book. You know what I think? I think you're falling into old habits, Erica. You're a sexual luddite, and you've got hang-ups and issues. Ok, think what you want, but here's the thing. There's a reason why 99.9% of the population doesn't walk around dressed in leather harnesses and having group sex or multiple partners. Yeah, because they've got hang-ups and issues. You make a book that's aimed specifically at the fringe, that's all you're gonna get buying it. Ok, well, what's your proposal then? What I would like is to see the book fall somewhere in the middle. Yes, we'll make a nod to the more "out there" aspects of sexuality, and our fantasies, but I really feel that you can't forget the core-- just real people. Because for the most part, we prefer to keep our fantasies safely stowed away in here. I tell you, if I went to "Delicious" tonight, I'd come back... with enough "juice" to fill half a book. That's interesting, Friedy, but Erica's editing this book, not you. Follow this direction. Find me the right author. But if you bring in a piece of garbage... there will be a price to pay. I got it. So, back in the "real world" are we? The look on Ethan's face-- it keeps running on repeat in my head. Yeah. Hey, well, technically, it never actually happened, though, right? But it did. And you said that I would live regret-free. No, Erica. I told you to live the day as you wanted and that nothing would stick, but it seems that something has. Something has, and I have no idea what to do about it. Everything has a consequence, Erica. Every action has a reaction. That's Isaac Mewton, right? Well, I was kinda paraphrasing him there, but yeah. And now you have a choice here-- to do something about your predicament or to not do something about it. But regardless of what road you choose, there will still be consequences. 'cause there always are. Always. Consequences. When we ask the question, "why can't I?" They're right there, staring us in the face-- the answers we don't want to hear. Hey, next time, no experiments. Just our regularly scheduled therapy. It's coming right up. Hey, you. Gimme a sec? Yeah. Enjoy. Thank you. So... Yes? It's been a while. Since? Since we've hung out. We've never actually "hung out," Erica. Yeah, no, I guess-- I guess we haven't. So, where were you this morning? Avoiding me? 'cause I blocked your efforts to get inside my head? Uh, not exactly. Well, I'll tell you what, you treat a poor barista to a fancy dinner, I'll answer anything you wanna know. I can't. Ok... what did I do? Nothing, honestly. I just, um... you know how you refuse to talk about your therapy and Dr. Fred? How did you know my doctor's name is Fred? I just do. And I refuse to make my boyfriend's life a living hell. Oh, so this is about Ethan? He's telling you who you can and can't be friends with? You're cool? It's my decision. Really? Really. I'll just see you for your morning latte, then. -- Sync, corrected by elderman -- -- for www.addic7ed.com -- www.tvsubtitles.net
