 Being Erica (2009–2011): Season 3, Episode 3 - Two Wrongs - full transcript 
 Erica and Julianne learn that Brent is outbidding them for Seth Newman's book, not because he wants to publish it, but because he will do anything to ruin Erica and Julianne, who, to him, is purely the competition who he doesn't like. Erica wants to use diplomacy to deal with this situation. When Brent doesn't seem interested in diplomacy, the battle between 50/50 and River Rock becomes an all out war. Armed with incriminating information from Brent's past, Erica and Julianne decide to ruin Brent like he seems determined to do to them. Before Erica makes this joint decision with Julianne, Dr. Tom wants the therapy group's take on the situation. With a split decision amongst the group, Dr. Tom believes Erica can learn what her actions will lead to by visiting a time in her past when she went to visit Leo at university, specifically during rush week when he was pledging a fraternity which was two weeks before he quit school. The first time around, Erica did not spend any time with Leo as she hooked up with a man she met there, but she vows to spend all her time with Leo this second time around. She is initially unaware of how this revisit will help her, but with Adam accompanying her, she sees how Leo's situation with the fraternity makes her feel even more angry than she is with Brent. But only with a further visit to a time in Adam's past does she truly understand the nature of her revisit to Leo's rush week. Meanwhile, Sam finds some anti-anxiety pills prescribed to Barb and wants to find out the underlying issue for the prescription. And Erica receives an urgent visit from someone in her past.

 Previously on "Being Erica": He was 21 when he died. That weekend we were up at the farm and things were tense. He had dropped out of University again, and this time there was nothing that was gonna make him go back. I've been in this bubble my whole life and I'll I'm saying is that now is the time for me to get out. You don't make a decision like this without a plan.

 Why not?! It's my life. Dr. Tom: That girl is my daughter. Sarah. Sarah. Dr. Tom: We had a fight this day. No, I don't want you to have this life! This makes me happy! And it was one of many, but this day I said some things that I later regretted. Stop it! Don't touch me! Forget it, dad! I'm never coming home! This was the last time that I saw my daughter.

 When I saw you back in 1998, you were so different. So... Dr. Tom: Angry. Yeah. Angry and... Just bitter. It's sad. This is the next phase of your journey as a patient. So it this it? Is this group? Just sitting around, you know, talking about my feelings. I mean, what about the regrets? What about my list? What about time travel? Is there any of that? Yeah, sure. Yeah, you'll still go back in time. Sometimes alone... But sometimes in pairs, or groups. So what are you? A thief? I was an enforcer for a loan shark. An enforcer. That means that you...? Beat up people or took their shit if they couldn't pay. What's wrong? Norm and I broke up. Wait, does that mean you got the job? I did. Congratulations! Thank you. Doctor. I didn't get your name. Lenin. I was looking out for River Rock. You were looking out for "numero uno" and Frank is either too naive or in the early stages of Alzheimer's not to see that. Julianne. We are so stoked for our plans for your manuscript, "The Purple Door." And I heart that name. I heart it. That's good. Thank you. This isn't a war, this is business. And if you sign with them, you'll be signing your name to nothing and turning your back on a big opportunity. I told Seth to be here for two. Well, maybe he's on tardy writer-time. Where two means 2:27. Who's Seth? He is our first author and he's coming over to talk strategy. Delivery! They say good things come in small packages. Do you mean Dave or the box, barbrapapa? Hmm... hm. Hey, Erica, come here! Erica and Ivan: Yay! Look. Oh... Co-presidents. That's us. Fancy shmancy. I like. You know he's really late. Maybe we should call him? Oh! Or maybe that is him. Stop, stop. Ivan, what are you doing? I temped for two weeks once. 50/50 press? Please hold while I transfer. A Lesley Kalajian? Ooh! Good. Thank you, Ivan. Thank you, Dave. Hey, Lesley. Are you calling to wish us "happy first day" in our new office? You have an office? I'll have my assistant call for your address. Ooh, tell her to send submissions. Keeping our office means we'll need more than one book to publish. Ah, speaking of.... I have very exciting news. I signed Seth Newman. Uh... that's, uh... That's fantastic news, Les. You must be so stoked. He's a talent. A rare find. Yeah, and... Hey, listen, is he on his way over? Because we were supposed to talk strategy today. Uh, let's put a pin in that. Because the thing is... I've received another offer for Seth's manuscript. What? Les, he was here last week and he said he was in. We have a deal. You had an informal conversation before he was represented. Lesley... Every publisher in the Canada rejected "The Purple Door," so where is this coming from? I can't tell you that. River Rock? Can't tell you that. Brent? He's come back with a substantially higher offer. He's made it clear he wants "The Purple Door" at any price. Sorry, girls, but...

Didn't connect with the material? I am just so full of hatred for Brent Kennedy right now. Julianne, this sucks, all right? This sucks. What are we gonna do? Uh, well... Option number one: We surrender. No... I mean, Brent has more money, he's got more power, he's got more leverage. So we find another book. No, I don't wanna find another book. I wanna do "The Purple Door." Which leads us to option number two... Mm-hm? We bring him down - we beg, borrow, steal - whatever it takes to win. There's a third option. We could just talk to him. Or we could go drink cyanide-laced kool-aid. Big "no" to both. No, listen, Julianne. I'm serious. Communication, it solves most problems. I have learned that the hard way. Erica, this is Brent. Brent, the guy who, who... set us up, he got us fired, and is now trying to steal our first book. We are not going over there to beg. Well, hey, I didn't say anything about begging? I'm saying we go over there, we have a rational conversation, we clear the air, we voice our concerns, and then... You know, we figure out a way to coexist professionally. Julianne, I know this is painful. Oh chicken, just you wait. Yes, hello. This is Erica Strange. I would like to set up a meeting with Brent Kennedy. Mm-hmm. Oh, dad, i can't do lunch. I'm sorry. I've been going nonstop since the weekend. Mmm... sure. I should be out of surgery by then. Okay. Great. Bye. Mr. Kennedy? Erica Strange and Julianne Giacomelli are here. Thank you, Luis. Bring 'em in. Thank you. Bonjour, girls. Hello, Brent. Please, have a seat. Thank you. Something on your minds? Well, I'm just gonna get right to it. We're a new business and we're trying to establish ourselves, and frankly, we're feeling some hostility from you. So we just came to clear the air. I wouldn't call it hostility. You are River Rock's competition now. Yes, we realize that, but- Survival of the fittest. Don't blame me, blame Darwin. Brent, you're sitting in my office with my job. I think Darwin has made his point. What Julianne is saying is that we have no intention of interfering with River Rock's slate, so all we ask is you pay us the same professional courtesy. By pulling my offer on "The Purple Door," a property I greatly desire. You don't... "Greatly desire" it. But you do. Okay, Erica, you know what? I can't listen to this anymore. Maybe you both need to grow a thicker skin. Business is war. And as you made crystal clear at the Festival of Authors, we are not friends. Brent... Thanks for coming by. And b-t-w? From now on, I will want any book that you "greatly desire." I have told that to every lit Agent in this country. River Rock will pay. Whatever it takes. What happened to you? Oh, it looks like someone could do with a nap. Oh, tell that to the drunk driver in my operating room. Oh... I don't know how you're doing it. You're a machine. I've never seen you sleep, you don't eat, you spend weekends here. I'm making up for lost time. Yeah, well, for someone who's supposed to be saving lives... I don't really have one? Mm. You should do something about that. Right. I need a hobby. You could, uh... Join a book club? A book club. Yeah. Wow, you must really think I'm boring. Hey, maybe I could take up quilting while I'm at it. Okay, okay, uh... If you something more adventurous, how about... Scuba diving? In Lake Ontario? No thank you. Yeah. Hey, I have always wanted to try rock climbing. My ex-husband said I'd fall to my death. Anyway. I never tried it. I love rock climbing. No you don't. I do! I've done it all over the world. Railay Beach, Thailand. The cliffs are limestone, the views are incredible. Well, I think I would need to start somewhere that doesn't involve actual cliffs. The Rock Oasis. I'm a member. Totally safe. So, uh... If you ever want to go, just let me know. All right. Well, I'll see you later. Bye! Yeah, I'll see you later. - Sam? - Hey, dad. New job, new life for your new office. Thank you. Muah. I know you're busy, so I won't stay... Actually, dad, there's something I need to talk to you about. Um... This morning I was going to make a cup of coffee and I found lorazepam in the cupboard, prescribed to mom. Lorazepam's an anti-anxiety medication. You should talk to your mother. Dad, do you know about this? Really, Sam, talk to her. Well... Is she okay? Does this have to do with Norm? What is it? Dammit! I gotta go. I'm sorry. Thank you. I'll talk to her right after work. Perfect, honey. Maybe we could offer Seth a three book deal? Erica, one book at River Rock is probably worth three of ours. I need ice cream. I think better with ice cream. Do Dave and Ivan have ice cream? Julianne, we have been going in circles over this for hours. I really don't think that ice cream is gonna help. Oh... You know what would? Murder? That's the answer? Well, we wouldn't have to kill him. We could just scare him. Uh, can I have that back, please? Oh, we need ice cream. Can you set us up? Uh, vanilla or rocky road? Both. U-u-ugh! We should have never gone to River Rock today. That was... So humiliating. Oh, hang on, this is kind of fun for me. I told you so. It wasn't supposed to go that way. I mean, I thought that we could at least reason with Brent. He rode your coattails. You'd think that he'd remember. I remember. What? Julianne? Here we go. Ice cream for two. Or one. One will do. No. Um... When I got promoted as River Rock's editorial director of non-fiction... Brent threw a little "yay j" shindig my first day on the job. Wait, wasn't your first day my first day? You didn't invite me? Well... I didn't heart you then like I heart you now, chicken. But that's not important. Watch this. Is he hammered? Mm-hm. To Julianne. Not only my friend, my mentor, and my hero... "Hero." But also, the lady to my gaga. Wow. Keep watching. And finally, our fearless leader, Frank Galvin, would like to say a few words, okay? Oh, he's not. Julianne. I remember when I started this company back in 1813. Oh my God. Napoleon... Had just lost in Leipzig and I had just suffered my third stroke. And so I raise a glass to... Who the hell are you? Oh, Julianne... And there it is. Oh. Wow. What are we supposed to do with that? Oh, I don't know, maybe send it. To Galvin? To the entire River Rock family. Galvin's fired people for less. Oh, Julianne, I don't know. What did you say before? You said "diplomacy before war." Well, we, we tried diplomacy. Now it's an eye for an eye. Come on, would Brent hesitate? Yeah, then why are you? So what's it gonna be? Okay. Okay? Okay, well, it has to be a joint effort. Two fingers, one "return" button. "An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind." Ghandi. I disagree. You disagree with Ghandi? Well, look. We went to River Rock, we sat in front of Brent and I tried to reason with him, and he made it perfectly clear that he wants to destroy us. So you feel you need to destroy him first. Well, show me a better option. You know what? Show me any option and I'll take it. Because he just didn't leave us with a choice. I agree with Erica. When your enemy's motto is "kill the competition," yours has to be "kill or be killed." Hell yeah. It's self-defense. Or maybe you need a plan B. Do you have to publish books? Yes, Darryl, we have to publish books. Adam, let's hear from you. I wouldn't do it. You would just let him bankrupt your business? You wouldn't do anything to stop him? No, I'd do something, yeah, just not that. The guy wants blood, Erica. He's out for war. That kind of thing never ends well. Oh, and where is this coming from? What do you know about running a company? Not much. But I know a lot about wars and you don't. Erica, why don't you tell us about "the frat house." Why? Dr. Tom: Please. Okay... My, um... My brother, Leo, he had just left for University and all his friends, they stayed in Toronto, but he went to school in London, in Ontario, and I was gonna visit for the weekend. Only... On the bus ride down, I met someone... And we decided to split a cab to campus. ♪ Oh my life ♪ ♪ is changing everyday... ♪ Trent. He was all lips and cinnamon bubble gum. So, by the time I saw Leo... ♪ Though my dreams... ♪ Leo spent the weekend with my bags and I spent the weekend with Trent. ♪ Never quite as it seems ♪ ♪ and two weeks later Leo... Dropped out and came home. It he was obvious that he was having a rough time, but I was just so clueless I didn't even notice. And this time? I'll spend every second with Leo. No Trent, no distractions. I wouldn't count on that. What do mean? Sorry, this cab is taken. Yeah. By me. Look, man, whatever you thought was gonna happen, isn't. So get out. Now. Sorry. ♪ In every possible way ♪ Was that really necessary? I kind of enjoyed it. Okay, so, here I am, in '94, and I'm here to see my brother, but I just... I don't... I don't see the connection. To what's going on with you guys and Brent? Ah, don't worry, I'll help you figure it out. ♪ Oh my life... ♪ Thank you. There he is. This is the brother you told me about, the one who died? Yeah. You okay? Yeah. You know, I mean... It's always hard, but wonderful to see him. Leo! Erica. Hey! Oh, look at you. You're all sweaty and you're bony. Who goes to University and gets thinner? Huh? Huh? Easy. Easy. What are you wearing? Clothes. What does it look like I'm wearing? So, who's here like she said she was gonna be? Hm? I'm all yours, 24-7. 24-7? What? You know, like 24 hours a day, seven days a... Doesn't matter. Anyways, not a big deal the point is, is that I'm here. And we are gonna have a great weekend together, just you and me. Who's that? Leo. Hi. I'm Adam. Hi. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Adam... Is my driving instructor. Huh... So, Adam, you mind giving me and my 17-year-old sister some space? No problem, boss. Driving instructor? You think I'm stupid? Look, I know that this must seem a little bit weird. Erica, you show up here with some random Irish dude. How old is he? He's like thirty. Thirty? He's thirty? He's thirty something. Leo, please, don't tell mom and dad. Lips! Beer me! Sorry, Jordan, my sister just arrived here, so I'm... And I just finished my beer, Lips. Why am I waiting? Why does he keep calling you "Lips"? It's a nickname. Oh... Let's go! I'm thirsty. Rush 1: I can get it for you, sir, if you want. Oh, "I could get it for you, sir, if you want." No, I don't want. What I want is for Lips to get me a beer. When Lips gets it, it's colder, it tastes better. I'm on it. Frat member: Let's go, rush. We want beer, now! Hey. You forgot to open it. Frat member: Aww... Lips. What, is he retarded? Or am I the retard for letting him rush? Now go set up the speakers for the Toga Party. Okay. Leo... It's fine. I'm rushing. It's how it goes. Why don't you grab a burger, and I'll catch up with you as soon as I can, all right? Okay. Let's eat. You sure you have enough to eat there? Mmm! Hello? Metabolism of a teenager. So listen, Adam, I just have to say it. I mean... I am lost. I have no idea why Dr. Tom sent me back to this regret. Or why he brought you with me. Look, I don't know your brother, but he doesn't really seem like the "frat boy" type. No. No, he's not at all. But... I mean, he's eighteen. At this point in life, he's, you know, he's still finding himself. Yeah, but those guys are treating him like shit, Erica. Yeah, that's what happens when you rush a frat; it's normal. Do you know what a goat is? What, like the animal? No. I mean... The loser of the group. The one the guys all pick on for laughs? Okay... We only spent a few minutes with him, but... I think Leo's the goat. No. No, look, there's no way. Leo, he's the coolest guy I know; everyone that meets him, they love him. He's your brother. I'm just... Telling you what I'm seeing. Did he say the second or the third floor? Il treno e arrivato. Is that Leo? Alessandro ha mangiato la pizza. Is that Italian? Arriveranno stasera alle Otto, vero? No, you guys are just jealous 'cause I can speak the language of love. Frat brother: Yeah, gay love. Okay, all right, very funny. Come on. That's for an assignment. Would you stop?! Woo! Really? You guys gonna keep playing catch or is someone gonna crank the tunes? Sure. Hey, Leo, grampa here wants some music. Just none of your weird-ass radiomouth bullshit. It's Radiohead. Whatever. Give us some Hootie. ♪ Hey. Hey. Um... do you tie this in a knot, or do you use a safety pin? I just used a knot. Mmm... Hey, come on, let me. Hey, sis. Hey. Uh, you mind trading with me? The... the guys got this one. Yeah. Of course. Um... Leo, um, do you know if there's kegs set up? Yeah, we've got ten. Great, I'll, uh... Awesome. I'll see you downstairs. So... How're we gonna do the ol' toga switcheroo? Right. You know what? We will in a second. But first, I just... I really wanna talk to you, okay? And no, Jordan isn't calling you to set up a keg, or a stereo, okay? So just sit down. Blech... Here you go. So, I'm sorry to ask, but... Since when do you like this kind of stuff? Since when do I like hanging out? Frats and rushing and being a preppie? What's this all about? I don't think you're happy here. Why? What, 'cause the guys are riding me? They do that to all the rushes. As much as they do it to you? You know, I just... I don't think this is the right place for you. Those guys, they're laughing at you, at your expense. Leo... You're their goat. No. No I'm not. Look, they don't want you in their frat, and honestly, you don't need them. I'm just worried that things, they're gonna get worse for you until... You show up here with a guy dad's age and I don't judge you. No, I know- you're in high school. You don't know what you're talking about. Hey. Leo. You didn't have to call him a goat, Erica. And you didn't have to abandon me for an open keg. It's your regret.

Grab the first bus back to Toronto. Where are you going? Just stay here. No. Get your hands off me. Erica! Look, you said it yourself.

Better make it 10. What did you do to my brother, hm? It's this whole "honor in the house" thing. You wouldn't understand. What did you do to my brother? There's a hierarchy here. Without order, there is chaos. You can't even say it, can you? Hm? What? Do you want me to describe it to you? Why? So you can tell mommy and daddy? Get away from me. Okay, fine. I'm so sorry. Are you happy? You having fun at the party? What you did, it was sick. Are you done? You're welcome to stick around if you want, but the whole tears thing's really killing it for me. Ow! Shit! My face! You broke my goddamn nose! We need to find Leo, we need to find him now, and we need to pull him out of here. Erica, what did you do? Erica, I got our bags. Just come on, I wanna leave. You see this blood? This is nothing compared to what's gonna happen to you, you little bitch! Agh! Agh! Go! Now! Come on. Ungh! You next? I broke that asshole's nose and I enjoyed it. You'd think that I'd feel guilty, but... not at all. You know, I feel pretty good actually. What, you don't believe me? Oh, I believe you. I just don't think you've got anything to feel great about. You lost control and now you're getting off on it. You know what? So what?! It's a hell of a lot better than standing around crying. You know, I should go back there. I should go back there and trash the place. Smash that bastard's RX7. Look, Leo, you can't. You think I don't know that? But Adam can. Right. I go back and I do what, exactly? You smash his head in. Break his legs. I don't care what you do. You just make sure that you hurt him. Is that really what you want? Oh yeah. You folks need a cab? Yeah, Leo, get in the car. I'm serious, Leo. Get in there. We need to let Leo cool off for a bit. If the point of this trip was to teach me perspective, then... lesson learned. I thought I hated Brent for stealing Seth's book, but... wow, can things get darker. Yeah. It can. But "darkness is only driven out with light. Not more darkness." Martin Luther King. Oh no, the fact is that good can come out of darkness. Jordan will get what's coming to him. Julianne and I could get Brent fired, and save our company. I'm not denying that there can be a gain, I'm only asking you to consider what will be lost. If you're talking about Jordan? Absolutely nothing. Hm. Well, I think Adam has something that he wants to show you about perspective. I don't recognize any of this. We're in my past. Come on. Hold him up! Stay back and stay quiet. Adam, what is going on? Get up! It's me... Enjoying myself. The guy owed me money. He owed a lot of people money. Where ya going? Where ya... Come on, come on, come on. Do you stop soon? I haven't broken his hands yet. Just stop, please! Stop what? I guess Dr. Tom thought this might give you some more ideas for Jordan. What?! I can't watch this. You know, a history of violence, it's something that Adam and I have in common. You know, I remember the first time that I beat someone up. It was in a bar, and, uh, it was about a week after Sarah had disappeared. I picked a fight with the bartender, as a matter of fact. And, uh... I remember my hands shook, I felt like I wanted to vomit. And the second time, it was uh... Easier. And after that, Well, it just stopped registering really. It became normal. So, I mean, what? You think I'm gonna become like you, like Adam, because I wanna protect my brother from a monster and I wanna save my business from being destroyed? You take one step in that direction, it's still a step; it opens the door to more. And violence is violence, whether it's physical or not. Dr. Tom: You know, you do violence to Jordan, to Brent, and it might solve one problem, but it creates a far more serious one. An acting counter to your own values will do more than just change your circumstances, it will change you, and you may not like what you become. Um, hello? What're you doing. Uh, just hang on a second, Julianne. Don't be a chicken, chicken. No, I'm not being a chicken. I... It's just... Is this the right thing to do? Of course it's the right thing to do; Brent is trying to destroy us. So... we destroy him? Yes, we destroy him! And then we go after Friedken and we expose him for the fraud that he really is! If you knew what I know about that guy... Julianne- and we don't stop there! We do not stop until we take down Frank Galvin himself. Until we turn all of River Rock Publishing into a giant... Rubble heap. Is that why we opened this business? They started it. Yes, they did. But I want to publish books and what you're talking about here is... Is something else entirely. Erica... It's gross... What we're doing and it's beneath us. Hey, mom. Hey, honey, how was your day? Ehn... long. Tiring. Well, it's a shock to the body to start working. Sit. I'll make some tea. Mom, I don't want tea. I found your pills. Oh. Is this about Norm? No. What's going on? Tell me. Or I'll ask dad, 'cause he knows, right? When did you speak to your father? He came to visit me. He wouldn't tell me what's going on. He just said I should talk to you, so... What is it? I have breast cancer. There's a possibility it's localized, that we caught it really early. I'm waiting for the tests. Sam, I didn't wanna tell you till I had all the information. You have cancer? Yes. Okay. Well, if it has been caught early, then that's good. Really good. I'm a doctor, I know what I'm talking about. I know you do. Your Oncologist, I wanna know his or her name and which hospital you'll be going to. Okay. Does Erica know? Not yet. One step at a time, okay? Sweetheart. Coming! Hey. So, um... Did you send the email? No. Thank you. Now, you know, we just need to come up with a plan B. I'm two steps ahead of you. I am calling Lesley Kalajian in the morning to tell her... We will be outbidding Brent on "The Purple Door." Okay, but we... I mean, don't have the money to do that and we don't even really have a way to come up with the money to- I have RRSP's. I don't. I... I mean, I could... I don't know I could... I could get a job. I mean, a different job than this. Maybe Ivan and David, they need a barrista or something.

Thank you. Bye. Some things are true, whether we want them to be or not. Thoughts become words, words become actions, actions become habits, habits become character. And character? Well, character becomes destiny. ♪ And I know that this night won't last forever ♪ It's a hard thing to look deep down and examine our character. Will we do the right thing, even when no one's looking? When it's not convenient? When it's ally hard? Will we do the right things simply because we have to? Because it's who we are? Because it's right? ♪ If suddenly I can take to the sky ♪ Jude, you are talking to a woman with two jobs. Oh, I got a freelance gig. Editing Blu-Ray manuals on the side. Mm-hmm. It's... It's very glamorous. Can you hang on a second? There's someone at the door. ♪ When our two worlds collide ♪ I need to talk, right now. -- sync, corrected by elderman -- -- for www.addic7ed.com --
