 Being Erica (2009–2011): Season 3, Episode 4 - Wash, Rinse, REPEAT - full transcript 
 Erica receives a surprise visit from someone she never expected to see again: Kai. She figures he is on a rogue mission as this visit seems against the rules of therapy. Regardless, he has much news for her, the most important being that he looks for her in the year 2019 and can't find her. Erica believes the worst for herself, meaning death for her in 2019 at age 42. As Erica progresses through the day, she can't focus on anything else besides the possibility of dying at such a young age and wanting to find out for sure what really happens to her in 2019. As such, Dr. Tom sends Erica back on a Groundhog Day (1993) scenario, reliving a certain time of her life over and over again, perhaps for eternity or at least until she figures out what lesson Dr. Tom is trying to teach her. But as he denies Erica her initial request, Dr. Tom does exactly himself what Erica requested for herself, which brings up concerns with Drs. Naadiah and Arthur. And Barb's actions may be a role for Erica to follow as Barb tells her of her breast cancer.

 Previously on "Being Erica": And I do have feelings for you, Kai. I wish that I didn't, but I do. You can try to rewrite who you are, but the guy from 2019, he's right here in front of me. The Mystery of Tomorrow. I'm not sure you're cut out for this title. But you're keeping the book here at River Rock. Yes, but... Doesn't mean it has to be with you.

 I have breast cancer. There's a possibility it's localized; that we caught it really early. Dr. Naadiah: You lost her... Are you afraid that you might lose Erica? This was the last time that I saw my daughter. Dr. Naadiah: This is a mistake, Arthur. Erica should be doing phase two with me. So should I look you up? Please, Kai, don't. And if you're going to, don't tell me because it's just, it's too weird to think about. Plus, I'll be 40. More like 42.

 Can you hang on a second? There's someone at the door. I need to talk, right now. Erica? Jude, I... I have to go. Can I come in? Yeah, of course. Kai... Sorry, I... I just didn't know if I was ever gonna you again. I mean, like this and... How are you? Hey. Won't we see you again, Erica. That's why I'm here. So this isn't your first time visiting me? No. In a few weeks, I'm come back to 2010 on another regret... Okay. And while I'm here we sleep together. We sleep together. Yeah. Okay... Kai, this is a lot of information for me to take in right now. And... I mean, why are you telling me this? Please, just listen to me. I came here to warn you, Erica. Warn me? Yes. Yes. About what? It's about the future - you have to be careful. I'm... What? I know it's unfair of me, it's unfair of me to just show up like this. You're leaving? I shouldn't even be here, Erica. Kai, no, wait... hey! Wait, Kai! Kai! Kai, look it... You can't just barge back into my life and expect me to do as you say about something that hasn't even happened to me yet? This was a mistake, Erica. Hey, listen, listen. I wouldn't put you in this position. You know that I wouldn't. Come on. After we slept together... I couldn't get you out of my head. I tried to stay away and I couldn't. And so I did the one thing you told me not to do: I tried to find you in 2019, and I can't, Erica. I can't find you. Well, where am I? I don't know. But nine years from now something awful is gonna happen here, in the city. What do you mean? A lot of people are gonna die and... And what? Am... Am I dead? Kai? I'm... I'm sorry, do I know you? -  It's the high cost of living. We know this, and yet we spend our days in denial. But inevitably, we will be forced to face the fact that we are not immortal and never were. Which begs the question how do you live, when you think you're going to die? ♪ Being Erica 3x04 ♪ Wash, Rinse, REPEAT Original Air Date on October 12, 2010 ♪ it's clearer inside of me ♪ ♪ who I will always be ♪ ♪ open me up to my heart ♪ ♪ feels like I'm seeing in the dark ♪ ♪ waking me up to my heart ♪ ♪ to do it all over... ♪ ♪ again and again ♪ ♪ until the end ♪ ♪ the sum of my dreams ♪ ♪ and everything I ever wanted to be ♪ -- sync, corrected by elderman -- -- for www.addic7ed.com -- Really? They're sure? Oh my God, that's incredible! Dr. Tom: Erica. Oh, thank God! Hi there. Dr. Tom, I go missing. I mean there's something awful that happens and I don't know what it is, but then he can't find me. Just, just because Kai can't find you, that doesn't mean that you're missing. Does it mean that I'm dead? It could. But, Erica, this a piece of information without a context. Right? And fixating on it, it's not gonna serve you. Right. Of course! I mean, there... There could be a lot of reasons why he can't find me. I mean... Maybe I'm married. You know, maybe I moved. But then I don't understand. Why wouldn't he get in touch with Samantha Erica because she would know where I am. don't do this to yourself. You can't just drop something like that on someone and then not tell them, okay?! I need to know. No one gets to see their future; that's not how this works. And he should never have come looking for you. Well, then why did he? And why did Dr. Fred even let him? I don't know. But you can't allow this to overwhelm you. Okay? Oh God. Julianne... Where are you?! Look, I'm so... I just lost track of time. I'm gonna be there in 15 minutes, okay? Fifteen? You were supposed to be here 10 minutes ago. I know. I'm sorry. I am sorry. Well, they're still here waiting, so hurry! I know, I am sorry! I need to talk to you. No, it cannot wait. Dr. Fred has taken care of it. And that was "taking care of it" was it? Pulling out his patient after he's given Erica just enough information to terrify her? Very professional. She should not have to deal with this. It's unfair! After Sarah went missing- no, no, no, no. We are talking about Erica, we are not talking about my daughter. After Sarah went missing and we started our work together, you asked me if she was still alive. And your point? I didn't have an answer for you. But that doesn't mean you haven't learned anything. I'd argue you've learned a great deal, by not knowing. Dr. Tom: Well, this is about Erica; this not about someone else. She can learn from this too. But she's not gonna learn a thing if we break the rules simply because Kai did. I understand how upset you are, but you need to remember that you're just her doctor. What is that supposed to mean? You know what it means. Should we, uh, maybe get started? I know Erica's been held up, but Seth and I have a lunch meeting. Um... Um, Erica and I are business partners and this title means the world to her, as you know, Seth, so I really... I just don't feel comfortable starting without her. Oh, and here she is! Oh... hi. Lesley, Seth, I'm so sorry. Hey, Erica. Hey. Okay, so now that we are all here, let's just dive right in and figure out something to make us all happy. Yeah? Here's the thing, ladies. Seth and I know you'll bring a ton of passion to this project... And we're gonna put all of our resources behind it. "The Purple Door" will be the jewel in the crown of this company. Look, Jules, I don't doubt that for a second, but River Rock is one of the big boys. Their resources eclipse yours. Not to mention the fact that this bidding war has grabbed the attention of some of the other major players in town. But just to be clear, we wanna try and make this work. And so do we. Absolutely. Great. In that case, let me be Frank. If Seth is going to go with you, a "boutique" publishing house, his deal is going to need to be... Sweetened. Now, when you say "sweetened," are we talking a cute little pack of sweet 'n low? Or do you mean...? Real sugar, Jules. Look, nine years from now, something awful is going to happen here. I don't want to be precious, but it's kinda my baby. Erica, you know how much the story means to me. Sorry. Uh... How about we put a pin in this. No, les, let's keep talking. It's no biggie. Once you've had a chance to read and... You're a little more focused, we'll get on the phone. Great space. Love the exposed beams. So, uh... We'll talk soon? Bye. What the hell was that?! Oh my God, Julianne, I'm so sorry. I just... I'm just feeling a little stressed right now and anxious. Well, snap out of it! We do not fall apart in the face of adversity, we rise to the challenge. Go get some air. When Lesley's list of blood-sucking demands comes in, I'll call you and we'll deal. Okay. Yeah. Look, I'm... sorry. Come on, Erica. Adam. Erica! How're you doing? Hey, uh... What're you doing here? Wait, where are you going? You know we probably shouldn't see each other outside of group. Uh, I gotta go. Sorry. Erica. Are you okay? I think you cut you're hand. Are you all right? Uh... - I'm fine. - You sure? I'll put the brisket in around two and let it cook for four hours, and that'll do it. You planning on feeding an army? Well, I'm not feeding my girls leftovers. Oh, the potatoes. Mom. Mom! This is ridiculous. You're gonna wear yourself out. You should be taking it easy. Well, I promised Erica. Stop worrying about us. Erica can deal with take-out. And, seriously, you need to tell her. Oh, Samantha, she's just had such a rough time lately, you know? Breaking up with Ethan, the new business... I know, I need to tell her. You do. Tonight, okay? 'Kay. "The mystery of tomorrow" is, for all intents and purposes, a sequel. Your fan base has expectations. And it needs to surpass the- the genius that was "the secret of now." Yada, yada, yada, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, booh! Yeah. I got it. With all due respect, Thomas, I don't think you do. The pages you've been sending in... Are my children, Brent. They were birthed from the depths of my soul. I've spent years studying new thought, yogi philosophy, metaphysical healing; that's what I bring. What do you bring to the equation, Brent? Well, Thomas, I'm an editor. It is my job- to fix any dangling participles and misplaced commas. Even Julianne got that right. You do your job, Brent, and let me do mine. Mom? Oh my God, Erica. You scared me. Sorry. Hey, shouldn't you be at work? Yeah. Yeah, I should. Is everything okay? Uh-huh. Erica, you're bleeding. Oh, you know... Stupidest thing. I was... I was running and then I fell and then I couldn't go back to work, I really didn't wanna go home so I came here. Come on, sweetheart. Let's go sit. Come on, come on. Ouch! Sorry. It's okay. Stupid. You didn't speak to Samantha, did you? Sam? No. Why? I don't know maybe you two had a fight. No, mom, honestly, nothing happened. I'm just... I just think that I'm tired and I'm stressed and I'm, I'm just being ridiculous. I think maybe if I lay down for a bit, I'd feel better. Okay. I'm gonna go make y a a sandwich. It's almost noon, you must be starving. Thanks. Thanks, mom. Ouch. "Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment." The Buddha. You're meditating. I was about to, before you arrived. Ouch. Ow! So... Where's the rest of the group? Well, I thought it might be better if you and I spoke about this, one on one. You know, Erica, you're torturing yourself over something that may not even be true. I know, I had every intention of living this day like a normal day, and I know that I should be able to put it out of my mind, but I can't. I just... I don't... I don't know how to. Everyone dies one day, Erica. Yeah, but not everyone finds out that they're probably gonna be dead at 42. In 2019, am... Am I married? You know, do I have kids? Do I outlive my pares?S? I can't answer any of those questions for you. I know. U u know, if you sent me to 2019... No And that's all you're gonna say. No. but if you just, if you think about it Wh-wh why would you want that? I mean, to know your future? What....What could that possibly do to to help you? because it would shut off everything that's going on inside of here right now. All right? If I'm alive, then all's good. And if I'm not, well... Well, then I'll just spend the rest of my time... Living life to the fullest. All right? Well, why not do that anyway? Because I can't. It's... I just can't escape it. I just... I keep thinking about what Kai said over and over and over again and it feels like there's no way out. Well, Erica, you know there's always a way out. It's just... It's just a question of finding it. I need to talk, right now. Kai. What are you doing here... Again? I'm... I'm on a regret. I came here to warn you. Yeah, you already told me all this. What do you mean? What time is it? It's eight in the morning. What am I doing here? We've... This has already happened. I mean, all of it. Did I screw something up by coming here to tell you? I need to go. What? Kai! Kai, tell me what happened in 2019. No. Why can't you find me? Listen, where did you look for me? Did you talk to my sister? Did you talk to my parents? We've already had this conversation? Please, there's no time. Just tell me quickly, before... Oh! Dammit! Excuse me? Please... Dr. Tom, I really need to talk to you. What're you trying to teach me? Why am I repeating this?! I am not doing this. Oh my God. I need to talk, right now. - Come. - Whoa. You, you're on a regret and you came here to warn me because you can't find me in 2019, right? How do you know that? Look, I just do. And please, before Dr. Fred pulls you out again, why, Kai? Why can't you find me? Am I dead? Dr. Fred's gonna pull me out? Yes. So just please tell me quickly, everything. Kai, Kai, wait! I'm stuck in this loop! ...Need to go before I do anymore damage. Tell me! God! Grrr! Really? They're sure? Oh my God! Oh my God! That's incredible! Oh my God, that's incredible. Life's amazing. I have to tell the world. I can't believe I have to do this stupid meeting again. Julianne, I'm almost there. Get a grip. The thing is, ladies, Seth and I know you'll bring a ton of passion to this project... Oh, we will, and I promise you we will put all of our resources behind it. The Purple Door will be the jewel... In the crown of this company. I don't doubt that for a second, but River Rock is one of the big boys. Their resources eclipse yours. Oh, and I bet that the vultures are circling our little "bidding war" as we speak. Right? Hm? I wouldn't say it exactly that way... But just to be clear- we wanna make this work. Yes, we do. Absolutely. Great. In that case, let me be Frank. If Seth is going to go with you, a "boutique" publishing house... Ouch. His deal will have to be... Sweetened. "Sweetened." What a word. Honestly, Erica, this not just about the money. No? Oh. Well, then what is this about? I mean, why are we talking about money at all if it's not, as you say, "just about the money"? I don't feel comfortable discussing this in front of my client. A client that we found. Excuse me? Oh, come on. We told you that we wanted to publish Seth, you sign him, and now you bleed us for a bigger commission? Nonsense. Cherry picker. Erica! Why are you being so hostile? Why aren't you answering my question? Like I said, I'm not discussing it. Oh, yes, you are. No, Erica, I'm not. I think we're done here. Whoops! What is wrong with you? I'm... Les, please, wait up. I am beyond sorry. Kerpow! Coffee? Erica, what're you doing here? Hey, um, I... You know, I just work down the street, next to Goblins. It's this great cafe? Listen, Adam. I'm kind of having a really strange day here and I need someone to talk to because Dr. Tom is MIA. Wait, Dr. Tom... Oh, he's ignoring me and he has me repeating this day, and I don't know why he's he's doing it, and I don't know how to make it stop. Okay. I'm taking 15, okay? Let's go talk. One time he sent me back, I wake up under these huge warm lights, and I can hear people talking, but when I go to say something, it comes out like a squeal. You're a pig? I'm a baby. In an Incubator. Dr. Tom sent me back to when I was only a few hours old. He wanted me to feel what it was like to be... I don't know, to be powerless. To be... Okay, great, but wait. What is the lesson here? To turn me into a big freak? Because if I'm not bawling, then I'm throwing pens at peoples' heads and- you threw a pen at someone? Yeah. It's ridiculous. I mean, would you act this way if you were in my shoe probably not, but... I've kind of made my peace with death. Well, good for you! I haven't, okay? I mean, there's so much more that I wanna do. Well, what if that's all there is? What if 42 years was all you're meant to have? So you're just telling me that I should accept it? That, you know, knowing I have eight years to live, and then six, and then four, and then one. Like, what do I do in my last year? Whatever you want. Oh God... Oh shit! What? It's... I'm late, it's noon. I gotta get back to work, I'm sorry. I need to talk, right now. Jude, I'll call you back. Tell me what happened in 2019? Wh-what? I know that that's why you're here. You can't find me in 2019 and I need to know why. Now. There's a catastrophe... Kai! I'm sorry, what? I need to talk, right now. Shhh! Shhh! Hey, Erica... Shhh! How do you know? What? Why can't I talk? Erica... I need... Who's Dr. Fred? Oh my God. I need to talk, right now. Can I come in? No, you can't. Erica, I... Get out! I need to talk to you. Well, I have nothing to say to you. I told you to get out! Get out! Out! Get! ♪ this isn't helping me realize anything ♪ ♪ nothin'! ♪ Come on. Of course, you know, maybe death would be better than reliving this day even one more time. Mm... Hear that, Dr. Tom? Huh? I'm cool with death. You can kill me now. Is that the whole point of this lesson? Because if it is, death and me, we're... copasetic. Really? Really? They're sure? Oh my God. Oh my God! That... that is incredible! Oh my God, is it incredible?! Hey! What're you doing?! You know that you're gonna die some day? You know that, right? You're gonna die. You're dead. You're gone, you're finito. Forever and ever... And ever. You're drunk. You're right, I am. Crazy drunk! So what? Someone call the cops. 290, 213. 18th Avenue South. Woman has a dispute with her neighbour. Here we go again. I need to talk, right now. Come in. Um... Erica, there's something you need to know. Yeah, and Kai, you know, I don't want to hear it. Erica- look, I don't wanna hear that we sleep together, and that you can't find me, and that you're worried about me. Okay? Because then I'm gonna obsess about it. And end up right here, stuck in a loop, meeting you at my door for the 11th time. How did you know that I'm... Oh, the wonders of time travel therapy. Yeah, right. This is weird. You know, I had a dream about you last week. I wanted to know how it's been, you know, being back in the future? Oh, come on, Kai. I've put up with your "don't sleep with me" rant for 10 times. The least you could do is answer my question. Please. Okay, going back was shit... Mm... In some ways, but it was also a relief. Really? Yeah. How? Living in the past... It's exhausting. And I needed to get to a point where I could accept that the past is the past, and if I'm gonna get anywhere at all, I gotta focus on the present. It's so hard. What? Being in the present. Yeah, it's really hard. Cause your mind wants to go everywhere else - anywhere and everywhere but here... Which is the only place you're supposed to be. Good friend of mine taught me that once. Thank you. For... for this talk. You really have no idea how much I needed it. Erica... The reason I came here is because... The reason you came back here, is to take care of a regret... And that's exactly what you should be doing right now. Bye. Bye. Really? They're sure? Oh my God. Oh my God, that's incredible! Okay. I love you too. Bye. Excuse me, sir? Sorry to interrupt, but why are you so excited? Just something incredible just happened, right? And, and if you don't mind, I'd love to know what it is. I know, it's none of my business. My wife's pregnant. Oh! Congratulations. Thanks. It's been a hard road getting to this point. Anyway, I... I'm really happy. I didn't realize I was talking so loud. No, that's fine. It's a big moment. You got kids? Not yet. Maybe someday. Anyway, sorry for interrupting, and again, congratulations. Take care. Now, when you say "sweetened," are we talking a cute little pink pack of sweet 'n low? Or do you mean...? Real sugar, Jules. Tablespoons of it, up front. Honestly, this isn't just about the money. "The Purple Door" is... Well, I don't wanna be precious, but it's kinda my baby. Erica, you know how much this story means to me. Oh, yes I do. I figured that out the very first day that we met. I think that was about five minutes after Brent kicked you and your book to the curb. Listen, we've, uh... We've given you our best offer, and we can't and we won't be held to ransom. Erica, we're negotiating. Absolutely, Lesley, i understand. You're just doing your job, but... To be honest, we have nothing else to give. You know, River Rock has "resources," sure, but they can't give you what we're offering, which is our skills and our passion. I mean... Julianne, she edited the top-selling non-fiction title of 2008, not Brent Kennedy. That title was, of course, "The Secret of Now." Yeah, of course. And, I mean, I saw the promise in your book the very first time I read it. It was immediate, instantaneous. I didn't need any convincing you had me at the first chapter. So, it's up to you, Seth. I mean, you could go with the money and see where it takes you, or... You can stick with us, and we will put our hearts and souls into make this a best-seller. And that's the best that we have to offer. Okay. We will go away and discuss. If that's your best offer, that's your best offer. Thanks. We'll be in touch. Perfect. Take care. Bye. Hmm. Hey! Can you take an early lunch? Erica, what're you doing here? I promise I will tell you all about it, if you go for lunch with me. And don't worry, your boss won't mind. I'm taking lunch. So how many times have we met up? Oh, this would be our... Sixth lunch. We tried those shawarmas - not so good. But the pepperoni pizza? Not so bad. What are you gonna do if there's a number seven, or ten, or thirteen? Hey, trying to live in the moment here, okay? Why are you making me panic? 'Cause I like to see you get worked up. Can I ask you a question? Sure. On one of our go-arounds, um... You said something that stuck with me. Oh yeah? Yeah. I asked if you were afraid of death and you said that you had made peace with it. What did you mean by that? I died once. I was brought back to life but... The paramedics said my heart stopped, I was gone. Do you remember anything? It was this job that went bad. One minute I'm running, and the next... I feel this... Not exactly pain, but intense cold, right here. Of course, I'd been shot. I don't remember falling, but when I looked down there was blood everywhere. And then... it's like I'm floating above myself. You know, like in the movies. So there I am, I'm looking down at my body and I'm not afraid. I wasn't at peace either. I was just... I was just sad. Sad? Yeah. I mean, what a waste. My whole life, everything I coulda done... Next thing I remember waking up in the back of an ambulance. Wow. I met Dr. Tom two days later, in the hospital. Oh shit. What? I'm late, I gotta go. What... what do you mean, what time is it? It's 10 past 12. It's 10 after 12? And I'm still here? And you're still here. Mmmph! Thank you, Adam. I didn't do anything. Yes, you did. Look, get back to work before you get fired, 'cause I have a feeling this time things might stick. Okay. Bye. Okay. Dr. Tom. I see you're branching out. Palm reading? Well, I prefer chiromancy. It's the proper term for palmistry. It has a bit more flair to it, don't you think? Oh. Have a seat. Well, show me your hand. Ah, you're passionate. Totally ruled by your heart. You needed to read my palm to figure that out? What about my life line? What do you see there? I see that you lead an interesting life, twisting back and forth... Twisting? Yeah, it's braided. You see that? It loops in and out. Jumping here and there, back again. And how long is it? It's not about length. Not there, and... Not here. You know, when I first met you, I felt so stuck. Well, your past was holding you back. And this morning, the thing that was holding you back was your future. Or, to be precise, your fear of it. Well, on that note, I am gonna go and enjoy every last second of this day. What do you think about that? I think that is an excellent plan. Okay. Hey, mom, I'm early. I'm in the kitchen, sweetheart. Oooh! Nice hydrangeas. I brought your favourite. Thank you. Hi. Muah. How come you're not at work? Ah... we're in a little bit of a holding pattern. Don't worry, it's... It's good, you know? It'll either work out, or it won't. What? Pffft. Nothing. Mom? Erica, there's something I need to talk to you about. Okay. What is it? Come sit. Am I in trouble? No. A couple of weeks ago, I found a lump in my breast. I went to the doctor, they took a biopsy, and it came back positive... For cancer, Erica. I have breast cancer. I'm sorry, sweetheart. No, mom... Why are you apologizing? You... I had the lump removed, and they're doing tests now to see how progressed it is. Now, there's a chance I might just need radiation, or none at all. But, um... I mean, uh, it's... Not chemo? It's not... It's not to that point, I mean it's not that bad? I don't know yet. I'm in a bit of a holding pattern, too. So you might? I might. Mom... Hey... It g gonna be okay, Erica. Yeah... Come here. Oh, mom... Mom, mom... So there I was, sitting in a Sushi restaurant for the first time in my life, and the only thing that looks familiar on the plate is this little piece of guacamole. Well, of course, it's not guacamole, it's wasabi. Oh, mom... You didn't! I popped the whole thing in my mouth. Five seconds later, my ears were smoking. My boss gave me his water. I was just a mess. It was just awful. Oh, that was so long ago. You girls weren't even born. Mm, excuse me. Mm-hm. Oh sorry, I just have to take this. Julianne, what's going on? Fasten your seatbelts, I've got some faboo news. Your little speech worked. My little speech? Oh, right! With... with Seth and Lesley. And? "The Purple Door" is ours! Woo-hoo! And I've got a bottle of champagne here and I'm looking at the label and, oh, look at that, right beneath where it says super tasty and expensive, it says, oh... Erica Strange. That's right, this bottle of champagne has your name on it. Oh, Julianne, that's awesome, I just... I can't tonight though. What? Why?! We're celebrating. It's we. Us. The A-team. Tomorrow night, okay? I... I really can't, but, Julianne, I'm so, so relieved. Okey-dokey, more bubbly for me. Hey. Congratulations, partner. Hey, you too, chicken. X.O. It's been a long day. Yes, it certainly has. Considering, for me, this day has lasted, oh... About... 50 hours. That's not what I meant. I'm sorry about your mother. Yeah. Isn't that ironic? This morning, I thought that I was given a death sentence because of something that Kai sorta kinda said, and then there's my mom, she's out there telling stories and joking about kamikaze rolls, and acting like everything is normal, like... Like life just goes on. Because it does. You get what everyone else gets, Erica; you get one life. And it's not about how long or short it is... It's what you do with it. I got it. You're gonna be fine. I don't worry about you. Well, I should get back and see my mom thank you, Dr. Tom. Thank you. Okay. Hello, Naadiah. What do you think? Is she shiny enough? You said not to worry unless something happens, Arthur. Yes, I did say that. Well, something has. Okay. Tom went to 2019 to retrieve information about Erica, to find out if she's still alive, and he did it only to satisfy his own curiosity. Tom, Tom... What're you doing? Do you believe me now? Will you let me fix this? What's this really about, Naadiah? Tom broke a rule, a big one. After complaining about Fred, he turned around and did the exact same thing. So the hypocrisy's bothering you. No, it's that he doesn't see what he's doing. We've been over this. This-this is about Sarah. It's always been about Sarah, and his denial that she plays a part in how he treats Erica is tiring, frankly. It's tiring. Dr. Arthur: Then let it go. You tried; He's not listening. You don't have to fix this. If we don't do anything, Erica's gonna be affected. Yes, she will. And you're gonna allow that? It's not my job to save Erica or Tom from their mistakes. It's not yours either. We let it play out. We let him make the mistake, and we let him suffer the consequences. -- sync, corrected by elderman -- -- for www.addic7ed.com -- www.tvsubtitles.net
