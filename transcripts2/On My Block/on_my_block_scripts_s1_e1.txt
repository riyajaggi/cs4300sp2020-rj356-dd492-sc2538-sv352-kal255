I don't see him. Something bad is happening. I can feel it. - I knew this was a dumb idea. - Pop a zannie, J. We can't see him 'cause he's being stealth. No doubt. He's got this. When has Cesar ever disappointed? Mmm, fourth grade. Kickball tourney. We lost. Only 'cause I picked the kid with no skills. And I'd pick you again. Loyalty trumps victory, compa. Ah. Take it in. [CESAR] This is about to be us. This is high school. Aw. Ruby, you think your brother's gonna marry Angelica? [RUBY] No idea. Mario tells me jack. [CHUCKLES] What about that time he said Angelica has a dangler? - But he said that. - In private! Time and place, dude. Oh, guys, check out Huerita at nine o'clock. - Monse, if you were a girl... - I am a girl. Yeah, but if you were a girl like that, would you wear underwear? Oh, my God, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Why are you gonna die? Those guys play for the 'Ridge. Did you know that last year alone over a quorum of kids... Died playing football? You're stuck on repeat. So, don't play. No choice. My pops was a legend. It's family tradition. [EXHALES] I'm dead. [INHALES] You're not dead. Football spiral? [HYPERVENTILATING] [WHIMPERS] Jamal, CTE is not in your future. Guys, check out my game. Huerita just gave me the nod. Ah! Eyeing my girl, cabrón? No. God, no. I'm not into blondes. Easy. He does your mom's taxes. Mrs. Guzman, right? Three thousand dollar refund. Schedule C, line 30, home office deduction. Seriously, dude? Yo, what are you doing, ese? That's Spooky's little bro, dawg. [CHOKING] I didn't realize it was you, homie. Hey, listen, tell Spooky Sad Eyes sends respects. Let's get out of here. Thank God for your brother. Don't. Thank God for better things. [GUNSHOT] - Oh, shoot! - Let's go! - [SCREAMING] - [BOY] Get down! Stand behind the door! [GUNSHOTS] [MONSE] That was a .38. [JAMAL] No, it was a .45. [RUBY] It sounded like a .44. [JAMAL] Wrong! - [GUNSHOT] - .357! - Synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com - Angelica's pissed. She's always pissed. You would be too if you had a dangler. What? - She's making Mario cry. - My brother doesn't cry. [RUBY] Dude, he's crying. Look at me. What are you thinking in your head? Nada. My brain is empty. Do I really need some stupid writing camp? - I don't want to waste my summer. - It's not a waste, it's badass. Not everyone can get in, even the kids who pay. But... you'll need this. It's for writing your stories and maybe an old-school letter or two, for your favorite? [JAMAL] Here comes waterworks. [SIGHS] Were you guys spying on me? [WEEPS] - You okay, homie? - [MARIO] Yes. No. I don't know. [CHUCKLES] Look at you. On the verge of high school. All the excitement. All the firsts. First parties, first football games, first love. - Want me to drop some knowledge? - Not really. High school, it's the foundation for the rest of your life. Any false starts could lead to your own dead end. Now sure, you guys are smart, setting curves and all that, but you still have to go hard, 'cause there's only one chance at a first impression. So, do you want to sit on the sidelines or play in the game? I just don't want to die. - Is Mario high? - [MARIO] Yes, he's high... on life and memories... and some seriously good indo. [CHUCKLES] What I was saying is work hard, put your heart out there, even if it's broken by some bitch you've known since Mr. Estrada's seventh grade social studies. [EXHALES] Anyway... uh... [CHUCKLES] ... what I was saying, and you may want to write this down... [EXHALES] Don't go into high school without back-up. You guys need to stick together to survive. Got it? I'm going to college, mofos! [LAUGHS] Now, kiss my class ring. - What the freak? - Is he kidding me? - That's why you don't smoke that stuff. - [MARIO] Damn, I almost forgot. One last thing: don't bone Monse. [ALL LAUGH] Why would anyone want to do that? [CHUCKLES] [MAN] Pretty Girl! [CHIMES BELL] Tasty. Ay, ay, ay! Mamacita! [MARIO] Angelica! Once I'm gone, I'm gone! There's not gonna be a Christmas break hookup! You know why? 'Cause I'm gonna be hooking up with other chicks! White chicks! [CHUCKLES] I don't know why I'm saying that! It's you! Talk to me, boo! Maybe she's not home. Oh. [CHUCKLES] Hey, you! [SIGHS] How was, uh... camp? Mmm, tolerable. Mildly life changing. I can see that. You can? How? You just... Look, I probably have to go before traffic hits. - No prob. Good luck at Cal. - Thanks. And you, keep an eye on Ruby? Don't know what that kid's gonna do without me. Check me out, bitches! I got my own room! My own room. So, let's not trash it. I don't wanna break my pimp couch before it gets some play. High school is an opp for reinvention. So if I want to live a new life, I got to be a new man. It all starts with my kingdom. - Royal reading? - Ha. No. It's a conversation piece. And 2.99 at Ross. Enough chitchat, let's feng shui. - I'm back! - Can you move that side table? No, seriously don't make such a fuss. I've only been gone all summer, but really, it's no big deal. - How was camp? - Camp was fine. Notice anything new? You got boobs. - You can wait for Cesar to help. - Then we'll be waiting a really long time. Why? Where's Cesar? We're not talking to him. - You in a fight? - It wasn't really a fight. More like... We're not getting into it. Trust us, Cesar's not cool. Well, I'm not cool being not cool. And why aren't you at football? We should really get to orientation before those lines get too long. Yeah, I don't want to be too sweaty for my ID. Like Mario said, "It's all about the right first impression." And sticking together! You're deflecting this whole Cesar sitch. Stop being bitches and tell me. What happened with Cesar? This silent treatment will only last so long. I will break you. Come on. There's no way Cesar did anything on purpose to destroy our crew. - He's the glue of our crew. - That was then, and this is now. Yeah, Cesar ain't shit. Shit, Prophets. - [RUBY] Be cool. - [MONSE] Ditch your colors. Damn it. Did I just jack my do? [MONSE] Yeah. Code dread. Code dread. Approaching on your six. [JASMINE] Yo! You guys going to orientation? Hey, you know my cousin Berto, the fine one, hey? His daughter Letty said it ain't nothing, unless you're stupid and can't spell your name. And then you hold up the line and then people get mad. Hey, why are you guys walking so fast? You know I can't keep up. I have asthma. Sorry, Jasmine, we're having a private convo. Real sensitive stuff. Catch you next time. [PANTING] That's what you always say. [PANTING] Man, she is relentless. - Nice save. - Oh, you're not safe. Your threats aren't penetrating, okay? I'm not telling you what Cesar said. Ah ha! So, he said something! Jamal! Do you need a muzzle? Monse, no offense, but you're a loose cannon. We're not telling you for your own protection. - My own protection? Eat a dick. - Case in point. You don't even know, and you're already at Defcon Solange. [GRUNTING] Don't look. Keep walking. Why would anyone want to get jumped into 19th Street? If it were me, I'd join First Street, only one second of pain. Agreed. And who wants a lifetime of commitment at our age? Apparently, neither of you. Lack of commitment seems to be a noticeable trend in this friendship. As does lack of personal space! [RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO] - We can't tell you what Cesar said. - Fine. Then I'll ask myself. Hey, you crazy? I just wanted to let Cesar know I was back in town. - And looking like a fine ass hyna. - An Underaged hyna. Not for some. It's all good. You just look a little different. What is it? My boobs. Nah, you got your braces off. [CHUCKLES] When did Oscar get out? Six weeks ago. Now it makes sense. Whatever Cesar said, he said to impress Oscar. - Cesar's terrified of his brother. - Along with everyone else. - Then who cares what he said. - Oh, just drop it. - Do I look like I can just drop it? - Actually, you do. You just won't. Tax time, bitches! Shit, Latrelle. Hands up, money out. How can we take money out with our hands up? I know you bookheads got that back-to-school gwop. It's orientation day. So technically, we're neither back to school nor out of school. We're... We don't have any money. What about that 20? At least you finally got your own room. What do you mean I don't have my own room? It's only been four hours. Abuelita's room is flooded from the broken washer. She's gonna have to sleep in your room till we can dry it out. Did you try renting a WetVac? Papa thinks that there might be mold. - So? - So she can't sleep in there. Ma, she grew up in an adobe hut. She'll be fine. Ruby, you've never had your own room. Why do you need one now? For stuff. Like... Like my brain. I mean, there's scientific evidence that the brain grows every day, and my brain needs room. A room to grow. - Do you really wanna challenge science? - Mmm. Why can't she stay in the living room? Grandma hasn't been back to Mexico in a while. Come on, Ma! I'm a man! I can't share with Abuelita. - What if I give you another option? - Yes, please, anything. Bring it. You can bunk with the twins! [JAMAL] Are you high? I'm not gonna hash shit out. To what end? Death? Cesar might've joined the gang. He's not stupid. He's affiliated, yes, because of his brother, but... And his cousins, his uncles, his dad, his grandpa. - Even the gay one. - I know. I know. Wait. You knew about the gay one? He goes by the name Bananas. It's not that subtle. No! I know Cesar's family's been in that life forever. But he'd never join a gang. He's an outlier. So whatever's going on, it's not that. He's not the same. - He dumped us. - But I wasn't here, so it's not official. If someone breaks up with you over text, is it official? - Yes. - Then consider me the text. [CLICKING TONGUE] Ding! You've been dumped! Wait, please don't go. Please, you're... - You're not safe. - Why? Because you've... blossomed. - "Blossomed?" - Popped. Busted out. Puffed your party pillows. Whatever you want to call your new cha-cha-bingos. These new homies he's hanging with, they're thirsty. Okay! Don't worry, girl! I got your back... from right here. - I need to talk to you. - I'm listening. Privately? Yeah, we can go inside. [CLEARS THROAT] But if you wanna sit on my face, you got to put that mouth on pause so I can concentrate. - Cesar is dead to me! - Told ya. He doesn't break up with us, we're breaking up with him! "Sit on my face"? Who says that? Chairs who can talk! And buttholes! I wouldn't put dumb crap like that past Oscar, but Cesar? What happened to him? Cesar's gotta be hitting the pipe. Right? Right. Could be! - [GRUNTS] - That was totally out of character. [GRUNTING] What are you doing? I'm getting into character. Hey, Pops! Say nothing and go with my flow. [DWAYNE] Monse! [CHUCKLES] Welcome back, baby. - You ready for the new year? - Bound to be a lot of surprises. - How was practice? - Yeah, how was practice? I don't know. Ask those D1 scouts who were all up on me. [CHUCKLES] That's my boy. Ow. Whoa. Did you quit the team and not tell your dad? No. Yes. Look, I suited up first day, and I just wasn't feeling it. Wasn't feeling it? Yeah, I wasn't feeling like breaking my neck. Listen, everybody who knows me knows I suck, except my pops. And he keeps thinking that I'm just gonna wake up one day and be him, and... I'm not him. I just need to find the right time to tell him. How ironic that a guy who can't keep a secret is keeping the biggest secret of his life. [SIGHS] - What? - I'm gonna rat you out to your dad... unless you drop the 411 about Cesar. What did he say? - No. - Yes! Mr. Turn... Cesar said you let him hit it before you left for camp. [CELL PHONE BUZZING] So, what exactly was the context when Cesar said he "hit it" with Monse? He didn't say he "hit it." He said he "smashed, really hard." - But who cares about context? - I care! Dude, you can't keep one secret. She was blackmailing me. - I can't do this right now. - Why are you whispering? - Where are you? - Hell. Look, I'm dealing with some jacked up, cracked up B.S. at home, and I got to work it out before school starts. So, this Cesar sitch, it just ain't top priority. - Can we just meet up tomorrow? - [JAMAL] Can't. Got one last shift at my dad's joint before summer's over. Dude, there's no way I'm facing the Inquisition all by myself. Geez. Can't we just meet at the joint at 5:00 and chop it up? [RUBY] Fine. [SCOFFS] God, you owe me a handy. That's my 11th text. Ruby's almost two hours late. Chill. He said he'll be here, so he'll be here. Trust me. Said the guy who's pretending to play football? Maybe my pops won't notice. Uh, somehow I don't think that's possible. Where the hell is Ruby? [ABUELITA] Five more minutes, kid. Abuelita, I have to go! Five more minutes, kid. That's what you've been saying the last half an hour. - Can I at least have my phone? - Five more minutes, kid. What's going on? I think it's pretty obvious. Great. So, walk me through the moment Cesar said what he said. - Don't worry about it. - There you go again. - There you go again what? - Keeping things from me. You gotta stop withholding, God damn it! [SCOFFS] I'm sorry, ma'am. It's okay. I watch Bravo. Monse. Wait! Monse! We need to go back inside. What did Cesar exactly say? And how did he say it? I need context. Tone. I need to know. You know what I know. What I don't know is why he said it. But he said it. We tried to get him to take it back, but he wouldn't. So what can we do? Drop it. - I can't. - Why? I'm still figuring out if I hate him. You heard what your brother said. How are we gonna survive high school without Cesar? Mario's not some sage. Don't take his words to heart. They're just words. If that's true then why should we take Cesar's words to heart? They're just words. Sometimes it's not what you say, but how you say it. And Cesar said it like he meant it. But things could be worse. What's worse than losing a friend? Entering high school with a rep. You're smart enough to know that a rumor could ruin your life. But it's contained. You're right. No one knows. Hi! Damn, Ruby. I see you! I see you! And I'm down with it. I like the freaky, just like Monse. - What are you talkin' about? - You ain't gotta be shy with me, girl. I know you and Cesar been gettin' it in. No one knows? Really? I officially hate the traitor, and now I'm gonna kick his ass. Monse! Monse! Oh, my God! ["TURN UP" PLAYING] You little bitch! - Ow. - [MEN LAUGHING] Damn, that hyna's wild. Must be a freak on all fours. I fought for you. I had your back. For what? For you to impress your puto friends and humiliate me? [MAN] Tell your bitch to keep that bark down. Hermanito, you better back up before you get smacked up. - Shut up, puto. - [JAMAL] Monse! [OSCAR] Hey, watch it now. [RUBY] No! Monse. - This is why we didn't wanna tell you! - 'Cause you're going crazy! Crazy? I'm crazy? Calm down. Breathe. Don't you patronize me! I don't need you. Any of you. I was trying to keep our crew together, but since I'm the only one who cares, you're all dead to me. I'll survive on my own. Jasonse or Monsmine? Which one you think is the better bestie power name? Yo, where we gonna kick it at lunch and between classes? We gonna hit up the flags? No, flags can kiss my juicy nalga. Nothin' but skinny putas. We are trying out for dance. I ain't sups coordinated, but I give really good face. I just love that we're doing this together. You feel me? Monse? Hello? Are you listening to me? All we were trying to do was be good friends... and now we're not friends. Yo, bitches be bonkers. Breh! Breh! Breh! Breh! We need like our own routine. Like a sick one that only we know, and we bust out at, like, at lunch... or before school or at all the parties we're gonna go to. Yo, check it, can you do this? Can you do that? Don't worry, girl, I'm gonna teach you. I'm gonna teach you. I'm gonna teach you. Soon, Monse, you gonna look like this. This is gonna be you. Hoo! You gonna learn today. Watch that, watch it. [GRUNTS] No, we're looking hard. This is how you pull in the honeys. No, we pull in the honeys by finding the RollerWorld money. This is lame. This ain't even real. You know what's not real? Is RollerWorld. There's no money buried in our neighborhood. It is real. You just aren't a believer. You don't even believe in the Yeti. [WHISPERS] Oh, my God. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. So... I'm cool if you're cool. - I'm cool. - I'm cool. Cool. What's in the sacks? - Forties. - Gatorade. I'll see you tomorrow? [JAMAL] Dad, I can't keep a secret for crap. I'm not playing freshman football. I don't even like football. What do you mean not playing and you don't like football? I... I don't like football... because I love football! And I'm playing varsity. You serious? - [WHIMPERS] - Bring it on in!

[MONTY] It's my job to worry. Especially since it's the first time  I'm leaving you alone without a sitter. Dad, I'm good. And not hiring Mrs. Ruiz will save us a lot of money. - Don't you worry about that. - I have to. Saving money means you don't have to go on long hauls as much, which means you don't have to leave as much, which means no more Mrs. Ruiz. Remind me not to challenge you in the future. You always win. I'm inside now. Door is locked. You saw it's double bolted. You saw it's double chained. So, get some rest and I'll call you when I wake up, okay? Okay. Love you, baby. Love you, too. [GASPS] What are you doing here? - Get out! - Hear me out, please. I never meant to hurt you. Then why did you say it? We promised we weren't gonna tell anybody. Hey. You were the one who said that we should keep this thing, our thing, on the low. That it would create a rift in the crew, and it did. So why'd you do it? Oscar. I don't understand. When he got out, he wanted to get at you, so I claimed you. To protect you. You don't have to protect me. Protect yourself. Leave. - Get away from Oscar. - You don't understand. You're gonna go off and be a famous writer someday. Ruby's gonna follow his brother and go to some fancy college. Jamal, he'll figure things out and get out. But this life... it's my destiny. My family crest is and will always be a gang sign. - It's too late. - No, it's not. - There are so many... - You guys got me all twisted all these years about a future away from this place, but it ain't gonna happen. Man, this is all I got. No, it's not. You got jumped in. - He's not coming with us. - And why would you want him to? Monse? Monse!
