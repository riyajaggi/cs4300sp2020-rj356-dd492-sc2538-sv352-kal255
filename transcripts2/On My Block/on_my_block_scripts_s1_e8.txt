 ♪ I was playing you ♪ All right, asshole, spill it. Tell me what this key opens. You know, Julio's been talking to me from the grave, and it ain't pretty. Now wake up and get to talking, bitch! [MONSE] Latrelle's roll-up on Cesar is all over IG. I'm really stressed. We've barely talked in the last two days. With all the Santos at his crib, it's like a safe house. As long as he lays low and doesn't show, he's all good. - [CESAR] I am all good. - What are you doing here? - Yeah, you shouldn't be here. - I have a math test. Cesar, you have a green light on you. I'm Spooky's brother. I have a green light every day. - If something happens to you... - I'm fine. I'm gonna be in and out. Just here for the test, okay?

 So don't worry, worry about your quince. Your dress is coming today, right? Trust me, I'll be good. I need a favor. Take Olivia's mind off me today. Get her to focus on her quince. - We can do that. - [CESAR] Go straight home after school. The block is hot - and I need you to stay safe. - But what about you? - [CELL PHONE CHIMES] - How do we make sure you're safe? Uh, I got to go. Shit. Tell Ms. Blanchard I'm sick or something. ♪ Yo, it's hard times ♪ ♪ I've done been through it ♪ ♪ Always sure to make it and I knew it ♪ ♪ Man, I'm about to do it ♪ ♪ Yo, I'm about to do it ♪ - You don't need to say it... - I'm gonna say it. What's wrong with you? You can't be out here in the open. I'm sorry, but I had a math test. - This teacher will fail my ass... - Goddamn math test?! I told you to stay at the crib. Use your head, before someone puts a bullet in it. I'm sorry, all right? It sucks being stuck. Just don't be so stupid. So what should we do about the situation? [CHUCKLES] I say we have some fun, Lil' Spooky. [SIGHS] I know Cesar doesn't want me to worry, but I can't help it. You don't have to rationalize it. Getting rolled up on is no joke. Cesar said you were there with him. What exactly happened? Monse, I can't stop thinking about you. About us. - I don't want to think about it. - Shouldn't we do something? It's Cesar! [DOOR OPENS] Hey, hey, no more Cesar talk. My boy can handle himself. Olivia, imagine everyone is quietly waiting for you, and then suddenly, you appear... in this. Oh. I mean... Oh! It's so... Forget it. I can't even fake it. - What am I gonna do? - Nothing. You will do nothing. - I will fix this, princesa. - [MONSE] How? There's no time. And we don't have money to get anything new. This is such bad luck. However, it's lucky that we're such positive, resourceful people who can find a solution to any problem. I don't think so. This is a real disaster. - I'm trying to help. - [SHUDDERS] Go help in my bedroom. [SIGHS] I'm sorry. It'll be okay. Maybe. Go. Don't worry. I got this. [CELL PHONE RINGS] - Talk to me. Is he awake? - [JAMAL] No. Dude's still down, but I think he's recovering. I was singing "Beat It" and his toes were twitching. Why are you singing? Studies show it's the second-best way to wake someone from a coma. - What's the first? - You don't wanna know. So, get this, the nurses gave me Chivo's personal belongings. Jamal, I don't wanna hear about what kind of underwear... Unfortunately, he doesn't wear underwear. - But I have the keys to his nursery. - Why did they give you his stuff? I told the nurses that I was his nephew and they believed me. I now understand how babies get swapped. What time should I meet you at the nursery? Um... Four hours from... never! Your anxiety on top of my anxiety is a heart attack waiting to happen. - I'm not anxious. - Says the Great Irritator. - I'm gonna go now. - Good. Do that and please keep yourself busy. I'll let you know what I find out as soon as I find it. [MESSAGE SENT BEEP] Ma'am, I'm not getting anywhere with you. I need to speak with your manager. Yes, I realize you're a small business, but... Oh. Then can I speak to your mom? - Hello? Hello? - [DOOR OPENS] I don't think I'm doing anyone around here any good, so I'm gonna bounce. - That's really mature of you. - Thank you. And don't worry, Olivia, you're gonna be fine. And so is the other person who I can't mention. He's gonna be fine. We don't need to worry about Cesar. What we need to worry about is your dress. Lucky for you, we have 48 hours and I'm a fixer. And a good fixer always knows a better fixer. The material is meh. And the stitching, clearly a novice. [SCOFFS] Me? I would've used organza. Not that satin or taffeta. And with your shape, strapless is obvious. - You're a four, right? - Mm-hmm. [LAUGHS] But what do I know? I'm just a seamstress who's only made a mere thousand dresses. - That sounds perfect. - Ah. - [RUBY] So you'll fix it? - [CHUCKLES] - No. - [BOTH] No? You live with a woman who makes dresses, and still you order one from this Etsy vieja? I'm no... How do you say? Side piece. Hmm. [DOOR CLOSES] [CESAR] Eleven miles. Might as well be 11 million. I can't believe I never come to the beach. I was out here three months ago. The night I got out of Corcoran. After four years in a six by eight, I needed to see something big. Open. Still don't like onions? Ever tried a shallot? What's a shallot? And you're supposed to be the smart one. [CHUCKLES] A shallot, my genius brother, is a type of onion. A botanical variety of the species Allium cepa. Who are you? Spelling bee champ, seventh and eighth grade. That's who I am. Shit, if I wasn't looking after your ass, I would've hit that magnet school up in Pasadena. - Now you're just messing with me. - De veras, homes. All my teachers wrote letters for me. Even the principal. Told mom I was gifted. - So why didn't you go? - And leave your little ass alone? But Mom was around. No, that wouldn't have been a good idea. - What do you mean? - Don't worry about it. I'm not a kid anymore. Mom wasn't always around. When she was around... she wasn't really around. I never knew that. Good. Then I did my job. I had plans to ace that magnet school, then go to culinary school. My brother, the chef. Hey, you joke, but that shit could've been real. [CHUCKLES] Okay, so use shallot in a sentence. Give me all your shallots, biatch. [BOTH CHUCKLE] [DOORBELL RINGS] - [DOOR OPENS] - Guys, say hi to Laura. [CHILDREN] Hi! Hi. [JULIA CHUCKLES] That was Cooper and Hayden. Feel free to entice them away from their screens if you can. If you can't, don't worry about it. Just hang out and make sure they don't kill each other. [CHUCKLES] Kitchen's over there. Help yourself to anything. I will be down the hall in my office should there be any emergencies. - You got it. - Thanks. I'm... [SIGHS] ...just trying to make a deadline and I even barely even started. Procrastinating is my hobby. Me too. What are you writing? It's a novel slash memoir. Some super personal stuff that I find hard to talk about let alone write. I've been writing it for years and I thought maybe moving back to LA would help motivate me to finish, but... Where did you move from? New York. Yeah, where are you from, Laura? - Freeridge. - Freeridge? Get out of here. - Are you from Freeridge? - No, but my neighbor Rosé is. Is that where you know me from? Yeah. We met once at her Halloween party. We did? I'm sorry, I don't remember that. But I... As a mother of two, I'm a little scatterbrained. You didn't tell me where you're from. Where in LA? - Not too far from here. - Where? You know, west side. I should probably get back to work. Make yourself at home, okay? [OSCAR] I can get used to this. [CESAR] Good, 'cause I'm gonna move here someday. [OSCAR CHUCKLES] I'm serious. What? Are you gonna be one of those crazy homeless dudes at the Venice drum circle with dreads and henna tats? - Hey, I'll visit you in your box. - Screw a box. Gonna have a killer house, first of all. And second, you're not visiting. You're gonna live here with me. Who says I want to live in a beach house? [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] Yeah, I guess I could live in a beach house. But how are you gonna afford it? This ain't Freeridge. I'm gonna be an architect. Design buildings, arenas, and of course my own beach house. Only now that I know you'll be living with me, I'm thinking multi-use. What's that mean? It means your restaurant will be downstairs and we'll live above it. What kind of school you gotta go to to be an architect? A good one, but I got it all planned out. JC for a couple years to save the cash, then transfer to UCLA. It's a good plan. How are you gonna afford it? I'll figure it out. Hey... We'll figure it out. Is this all you got? You're my blood and don't know how to bribe me? - Qué lástima. - Cookies? It's the right direction. I made a terrible mistake. We knew how busy you are, so we went with Etsy, which was an even bigger mistake. And now I realize the mistakes of my trespasses, and I said hundreds of Hail Marys. We need you. Is there anything we can do to get back into your good graces and enlist your brilliant skills to fix my awful dress? Well... There is something. Put the phone down. Cesar's fine. He's with Oscar. Trust me, no one's running up on that dude. I'm putting the phone down. - How are you doing down there? - Has this woman never worn shoes? - Ugh. - [GASPS] - Is that... - Yep. It just fell off. - [GAGS] - [SNORES] [CLEARS THROAT] Here. Hmm-mm. Hmm-mm. [OLIVIA CHUCKLES] What? I'm so glad you're here. I'd be freaking out without you. [CELL PHONE CHIMES] - [SIGHS] - What? He's safe. And cute. Isn't he cute? Yeah. [MONSE] Do you want to do a project with me? Yeah, what kind of project? I was thinking something really, really fun. Are we gonna build a castle? We're gonna build something even better. It's called a family tree. Come on. Family trees are awesome. - We'll start with your mom's side. - I'm hungry. We can get a snack right after we do this one side. I'm hungry now. Okay, we'll eat. - What are you hungry for? - Uvas. ¿Tú hablas español? - Sí, un poco. - ¿Quién te enseño? I want to watch Trolls. No. No, no, no, no. Who taught you how to speak Spanish? Your Mom? No, Dora. Is that your grandma? No! Dora the Explorer. My grandma's up in heaven with our kitties. [CELL PHONE BUZZING] I'll get you some snacks. - Hey. - [JAMAL] I changed my mind. I need you to come down to the nursery. This place is too creepy to scour solo. - When can you get here? - I can't. I'm babysitting. What? At a time like this? You told me to keep myself busy. Fine. Then stay with me in case something goes down. What's gonna happen? Chivo's in the hospital. True. - But I'm not alone. - What are you talking about? It's hard to explain. Anyway, I've got Chivo's key, but... I can't find anything. [COUGHS] Oh, my God. I think I found the lock. It works. [EXHALES] Okay. I'm opening Chivo's drawer. [SCREAMS] Jamal? Jamal, are you okay? Juanita. That sick bastard held her captive. - He knew where she was the whole time. - Who held who captive? Don't worry about it. You're better off not knowing the sordid details. - Just bear with me. - I'm here. RG. Ricky Galindo. What the hell? What is this? Monse, I'm gonna call you back. Twenty, seven, 42. [JULIA] Laura! Laura! My mom's calling you. Oh, right. Thanks. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] - Hi. - Hey, um... Any chance you can watch the kids a little bit longer? I'm finally in a groove and I don't want to stop. - Sure. - Oh, thank you so much. So, in like 30 minutes-ish, can you make them some dinner? - I have chicken nuggets in the freezer. - No problem. Thank you so much. Is that the Sacré-Coeur? Good eye. Have you been to Paris? No, but someday. What's it like? Amazing. Inspiring. I actually lived there for a year, but sadly I haven't been back since. - When were you there? - 2004. That's the year I was born. Magical year for both of us. [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [SNORES] Should we wake her up? It's a delicate dance. While we need her to work on the dress ASAP, the more she relaxes, the more indebted she'll feel. I think we let her sleep. [GRUNTS] [SIGHS] Gracias. I'm so relaxed. Relaxation breeds creativity. Mm. This relaxation made me extra sleepy. [CHUCKLES] Bed time! Wait. The quince's in two days. Shouldn't you be measuring her hips? Or bust? Buenas noches. She just played us. - [OLIVIA GASPS] - [RUBY CHUCKLES] How did she know? [ABUELITA] It's what I do! [BOTH LAUGH] The beach was pretty dope. I'm glad we stayed for the sunset. - We need more days like this. - Yeah. More time to hang out. You know I'd do anything for you, right? Yeah. For real... anything. I love you, mano. Dude, are you crying? [CHUCKLES] Nah, fool. I got smoke in my eyes. It's been hot out here. I could get got. You can get got. Anybody can get got. - If anything ever happened to you... - Nothing's happening to me. I know, Lil' Spooky. That's why we're here. We need to handle this. [MONSE] Buenas noches. Thank you, Laura. We'd love to have you come visit. Right, guys? She was okay. That's actually a glowing endorsement. Well then, thank you, Hayden. - And I'd be happy to sit again. - Mama, read us a story. One second. I just have to pay Laura then put this back in my office. Mama, now! I can put that away for you. - Story! - Story! Story, story, story, story. Okay. Okay. Okay. Would you mind? I'll just read them a quickie, and then we can settle up. Thank you so much. Okay, come on. Let's go. What are you doing? [SIGHS] This lady isn't your mother. [JULIA] "We all have a moment where we feel sad, where the moon and the sun are not to be had. We look in the sky, we look in the air, we need our families, but they are not there. Alone, alone. Where can they be? Alone, alone. Can someone help me?" [WEEPS] [JULIA] Okay, you guys read the next one to yourselves. I'll be right back. Are you okay? Do you read to them every night? I try. I never had that. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. [CRYING] No. I'm sorry. It's just I have a lot of stuff going on and I'm... I'm not always this crazy. Hey, you're not crazy. Can I wash my face? Of course. The bathroom's on the left. Take your time. [SNIFFLES] [CELL PHONE BUZZING] [SHUDDERS] ♪ There's a place you hold ♪ ♪ I left behind... ♪ Here you go. Thank you. That's too much. But you came all this way and you came on such a short notice. - It's okay. Take it. - But I... I insist. You saved me. ♪ Going in circles ♪ ♪ The secrets I hide, I do nothing ♪ ♪ You'll always deny That we're going in circles ♪ [DOOR OPENS] [SIGHS] I went to school with Latrelle. - We played Pop Warner together. - And he still pulled a gun. - But he didn't shoot. - Next time he will. This way there's no next time. You've been playing me. All that talk about my future was... You wanna have more days like today? This is how we do it. Ain't no future if you don't handle your present. Listen to me, you shoot until you empty the clip. Don't freeze up, don't flinch, don't second guess. It's do or die time, hermano. Wait. Hold up! Punk ass got lucky. Just for tonight. You handle this tomorrow. [JAMAL] Twenty, seven, 42. My best guess is that these three numbers are a combo to a lock. But where's the lock, baby girl? Tell me. Tell your J-Daddy. I'm sorry. I'm tired. It's late. Yeah, maybe we should go, get some sleep and... [RUSTLING] Or maybe we should stay. ♪ Tripped in the dark ♪ ♪ You found me... ♪ [SIGHS] - Do you think Cesar will like it? - No. He's gonna love it.
