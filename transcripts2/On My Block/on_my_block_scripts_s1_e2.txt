 - Synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com - I have the binders. Done. This is the idea that we have figured out... Nobody cares about the binders. That's what you did. You're right. You got the binders. That's all you need to focus on. Yo! One at a time, I'm not following. Sorry, it's excitement. We've been chewing on this the last two weeks. And it's finally time to move forward with a plan. - A plan for what? - Getting you out of the gang. You're serious?

 Oh, my gosh. No! No, no, no, no. There is no out. You're being naive. Once you're jumped in, you can't get out. Unless, you get jumped out, and that's not, you know, an option. - Why not? - They beat you till you die. - Oh, I see your dilemma. - Yeah. Death isn't the only option. Ruby? So, after copious amounts of research, I've formulated a theory that all great things come in threes: The Holy Trinity, primary colors, Destiny's Child... D.C. started with four members. But they weren't big until they were three. Which is why there are three common denominators to end any and all hostile situations.

 I call them the three M's. Money, murder, manipulation. No, not that one. They're watermarked. Clearly, murder's off the table. The irony would be too much. There's no way we can hustle up enough cash with a car wash - to make it worth Oscar's while. - Unless... Jamal, don't. Please don't say it. Getting a lot of cash isn't outside the realm of possibility. - What are you talking about? - RollerWorld. It's real and 50K is still out there. The dudes that robbed RollerWorld got put away, - but the money was never recovered. - In the '80s. And the rumor's still rampant! What about The Goonies? Some of those kids thought it was B.S. until they found the treasure. - And they weren't even... - Brown. We're brown. Only white kids find treasure. - True. - What are you looking for? Baby Jesus. He's missing. The special one blessed by the bishop. I put him in here before I started to move into my room. Dude, you're holding it. No, this is Toddler Jesus. Babies don't stand. This Jesus is probably already potty trained. And this isn't a diaper, these are booty shorts. Sit down. Sit. - All right, I'm out. - We haven't even pitched the final M. Don't need to. - Manipulation. - Through negotiation. With cogent, well-articulated arguments. So, that's it? That's the plan? You're gonna get me out of the gang with cogent, well-articulated arguments? - Yes. - Never gonna happen. Good talk. So, that was the best both of you could do? If you'd given me the right binder the first time, then I probably would've handled the conversation a little bit better. Cesar's reaction was a wake-up call. The plan isn't fully formed. We need more time to let our ideas marinate before we take action. Marinate? No. We got to cook now. The longer we wait, the deeper Cesar's in. Right now he's got no responsibilities. We got to get him out before he puts in work. Who's putting in work? You still with that? - No. - With what? - Jamal? - We're still with it. This isn't funny anymore. Trying to reason with my brother's dumb. You gotta promise you're gonna drop it. - You're overreacting... - Especially you. Promise. - I promise. - Okay, good. See you after class. - So, who's gonna do it? - Not Jamal. - I'll do it. - No, no, no, no, no. Your mouth is gonna get us killed. Yeah, Monse's a total no-go. So, that leaves me. - But it can't be me. - It's you. You said it can't be me! I think this is up for discussion. I mean, for starters, I'm small. There's nothing about me that's even remotely intimidating and, actually, on numerous occasions, I've been told that just looking at me makes people laugh. I also don't do anybody any favors by being the smartest person in the room. And no one wants to feel dumb when they can't pick up what I'm layin' down. - It's belittling. You follow? - Hm-mmm. You see, this is what I'm talking about. I transcend the universal plane of thought and linger on the precipice of the celestial realm. I can't even keep up with myself. But it's who I am. But if all of that isn't convincing enough, then dare I remind you of my sensitive skin and inability to wear thick cotton. - What are you talking about? - I can't hide my sweat. And I sweat profusely when I'm nervous. Which I am right now. I mean, look, full clam. No shell. I rest my case. - Mmm. - That was impressive. - So eloquent. - Sold me on why he shouldn't do it. Which is exactly why he should! - Congratulations. You got the job. - Again. Brilliance is a curse. Hey. Why're you being so nonchalant? Being a Santo is serious shit. Monse, you and I both know there are plenty of people in the life that nothing happens to. They live and die and in between get a contact high and a couple of tattoos. Save the BS for someone who's buying. You're giving in without a fight. - You used to be a fighter. - There's nothing to fight. Look, I got a reprieve when my brother went to prison. I thought I could coast through high school being affiliated and then disappear when we graduated. But Oscar got out early, so here I am. What if you disappear now? And go where, hmm? Do what? I'm in. It's done. I don't wanna live my life thinking about dying, so I'm just gonna live. I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to rev up the pressure. I was trying to help. I know. I appreciate it. - And there is something you can do. - Anything. - If you want to help de-rev the pressure. - Yeah. Meet me after school. Your room. Clothing's optional. Yo! I am all about this "clothing's optional." How about we take this twosome, make it into a threesome, and we can get some? - Hey! - ♪ Money, money, money ♪ Damn. Jasmine's in demand. I'm gonna check you guys later, okay? Bye! You need to stop talking about us. Didn't we decide to pretend it didn't happen? Didn't we agree that dropping our secret would screw up the fam? But some families are really close. Those families are from Louisiana. I know what you're doing. And attempting to bait and switch my concern is not gonna work. You got to get serious. Hear me? I'm serious. And my window's always open. It'll never happen again. Never's a long time. - Unlike those two minutes. - Two minutes? It was a solid five. Three max! Three? I'm pretty sure that was lap four. Why are you still wearing that fake neck brace? Your dad's nowhere in sight. It's not about my dad. It's about muscle memory. The longer I wear it, the more sore my neck feels and the more legit the injury looks. - So the brace is doing damage. - No. Maybe. Crap, I didn't think about that. What should I do? - No clue. And I've got other problems. - Like what? I don't know. Like I have to have a sit down with a cold-blooded gang leader and attempt to explain why his brother should be exempt from the life he's living. How do you do that without being insulting? - Or getting killed? - Why would you say that? Look. Look, clear your mind, dude. Breathe. Margarita Ramirez, two o'clock. Come on! Give me the ball! Follow the bounce. Imagine you're riding that wave of bounce up and down. It's washing over you like a full body massage. I'm riding the wave. I'm bouncing. - Can I rub 'em down with sunscreen? - No. No sunscreen. Baby oil. She likes to take risks. Mmm. And I can be dangerous. After school. -30. - For what? - Practice. If it's not gonna be me talking to Oscar, then we need a script. I've whittled down the primary arguments into talking points for obvious reasons. Which are obviously what? - That we don't want you to die. - Breathe. - Follow the bounce. - Don't worry. I'll dumb it down. What the hell was that? She's not even in this class! Up and down. Look, take a mental snapshot. Deposit it in your bank and then make a withdrawal later in your room. My room. I forgot. I finally, finally have my own room! What do you mean I don't have my own room? Abuelita moved out. She did. But your prima needs it now. Cousin? What cousin? My friend Rosa, her daughter. - Her parents were deported. - So she's not even blood? Why can't she sleep with the twins? Or on the couch? This is reverse sexism! I can sleep on the couch. Mija, ignore Ruby. Ruben. I go by Ruben. Since when? Sorry about all that riffraff you heard. Total misunderstanding. Mom? I was being insensitive. It'll be no problem to share a room. Ay, qué lindo. That's my boy. Oh, and no. You will be bunking with the twins. Ah. But it would be cruel and unusual to leave her alone in this time of tragedy. No. Come on, I'm the man for the job. He's not the man for the job. We have to figure out the work around. Like his diction. Sometimes I don't understand half of what Ruby says. You know what I mean? - What? - You're giving me a migraine. Think about how I feel. I have no time to teach Ruby not to talk with his hands. He can't do that stuff with Oscar. Dudes gesticulate a lot in prison. We don't want to remind him... - Hey. - ... that... - Where you headed? - Nowhere. Whatcha doing, Jamal? Decorating Ruby's room! - So there's no scheming? - We're scheming. With color! Every good room rehab needs a color scheme. I know a lot about the color theory. I'll come along to help. You can drop me here, homie. Don't you have to go tag something? Nope. We're here to feng shui your room! That's why we're here. I don't have my own room, but... I have a boner. My cousin just moved in. Not like my cousin cousin, like, "What's up, cuz?" You know, like fam, but not fam. Like if you can't keep it in your pants, keep it in the family. Exactly! No. No, not exactly. There's no blood relation. There is no inbreeding. Oh, and call me Ruben. I'm going by Ruben now. Ruby! Ruben. Are you forgetting something? Guys, this is Olivia. She's staying with us for a little while. Okay? - Is it me or did things just get weird? - It's you. I'm Monse. - This is Jamal and Cesar. - Hey. Ignore the stares. They haven't been neutered. - CHUCKLES] - Jamal, why don't you tell Olivia what you didn't do to your neck. Ruby, can we discuss our chem assignment? Act natural, look off to the side so we don't seem scheme-y. Once you memorize the script, we'll need three rehearsals. Minimum. Do Cesar's abs auto contract or is he flexing on purpose? And you should check out the diction tutorials on YouTube. I can't understand half of what you're saying when you're nervous. - So, don't be nervous. - I claimed her. This is bullshit. And remember, we've got to keep it quiet from Cesar. This is a life-saving mission and keeping it on the down-low is of the utmost importance. Got it? Good. Now be chill. You're hilarious. I'm saving Cesar! You know I'm not blessing this, but Monse won't relent. And she absolutely cannot be the one to do it. I think Oscar will go easiest on you, especially given his respect for Mario. But when you say he'll go easy, what do you mean? I mean, he probably won't hurt you. Is there a good, like, happy time for him? I mean, some people aren't morning people. Do it before school. In a couple of days, a week? Tomorrow. He's expecting you. Don't be late. Good night. Good night. - Hey. - It's a dumb idea. I was thinking the same. I'm kind of worried I might be jacking up my neck. I'm talking about Oscar. I have an appointment with him in the morning. Should I cancel? Hell no, you don't no-show on Oscar. Unless... Do you have a "go bag?" - A "go bag?" - It's a bag you use when you need to go. You know, like with clothes, cash, passport, zombie spray... No, I don't have a "go bag." I called you to talk me down, not amp me up! - What's the worst that can happen? - Right. I'm just having a conversation. With a hard ex-con. Who already has two strikes. Yeah. You save your strikes for special occasions. You're not strike worthy. - Hey, I'm strike worthy. - You don't wanna be. - Good point. - He's not gonna kill you. - Thank you. - But if he did, you'd be easy to hide. - Jamal! - You'd probably fit in his "go bag." I need to unwind and sleep before tomorrow, and now I'm gonna be up all night. You know how I get to sleep when I'm all pent up? - Hit me. - To sack out, I whack out. Not an option, I'm too distracted. It's the antidote, man. If anything happens to me... - I'll clean out your drawer. - Appreciate that. Good night. Good luck. Hey. Un momento, espérate. Ah! Olivia. Sausage? Is it smoked? Don't you know I'm loco, ese. Button? No button? Oscar, I'm right here. Ruby! Mijo! Luis, stop glittering your sister! Ruby, I'm late! Get the twins dressed! I can't. I have a hard out at 7:55. Put the glitter down! Put the glitter down! Put it down! That's insane! Houston sounds dope. You're one of those cool girls, aren't you? I'm pretty basic. Said like the coolest of the cool. Oh, come on, you're no dork. Um, wrong. I am. I just have no filter 'cause I have no gene for giving a damn, so... Neither do I. Want to hang after school? I'll show you the do's and don'ts of our hood. No. Don't care. Me either. So, let's do it. - Um, give me a sec, I'll catch up. - Mm-hmm. What's up? Ruby can't be the one to talk to Oscar. He's the wrong messenger. No one should talk to Oscar, but he's the best of the worst options. - I could... - No. Oscar doesn't do badgering. I do... How am I badgering? I don't. Give me an example of how and when I've done that before? You can't, can you? Olivia! Wait up! Ay, Santa María. Acid? I can't. I can't. I can't. 'Sup, fool? What's with the glitter? Late night at the club. You know how hynas be. I feel you, homie. Sometimes my ruca wears that same shit. She be rubbing all up on me. I can't get the crap out for days. Women. Smoke? Trying to quit. Whatcha want to chop it up about? Um... Mr. Oscar... I mean, Spooky. I know you're a busy man, so I'll cut right to it. Is that acid? You know what? Don't answer. None of my business. So, Cesar. I mean, can we just talk about how smart he is? You know, I'm smart, but he's like... a certifiable genius. And he has off-the-charts emotional intelligence, which is rare. I mean, combine that with his innate ability to empathize and problem solve, and you get the real deal. A natural leader. Which is a testament to you and how well you raised him. - I feel you, homie. - So, what I'm saying is he has so much potential that hasn't been realized. He's just a baby bird waiting to take flight. Who knows how high that bird can fly given the right wind and lack of avian predators. - I never looked at him that way. - 'Cause he's not one to toot his own horn. Yet another one of his many attributes. You're right. He just needs to be given that right opportunity, with good wind and no vultures and shit. Well, vultures are more like scavengers. I was thinking hawks. Hawks can suck a dick! Exactly. I mean, you feelin' me, Spook. Spooky. Yeah. Mos def. You're opening my eyes, homes. That's what I do. You know... I will take that smoke. It's time to give Cesar his wings. You all right there? I did it! I did it! I mean, it's done. I rocked that talk hard. And for a guy named Spooky, he's surprisingly jovial. - Wait, are you serious, Ruby? - Ruben. And yes. Cesar's out the gang. Boom. Killed it. You did kill it. You killed it so hard that I got promoted. No. Spooky and I had an understanding. Just got a text, gonna start running for the Santos. No. No, no, no. That can't be true. He must be joking. Compa, I love you for trying, but like I said, this deal is done. And I don't blame you. I blame Monse. Me? Yeah, you're the instigator and the frickin' honey badger. You don't quit. But now you have to. No more. We're done. And so is "Ruben." I'm not man enough to bear that name. Hey, you're a man. Don't look at me like that. This wasn't a one-woman show. We all came up with the plan. I know it was you. All you. You should make it up to me. Oh, I can make it up to you, papi. Just gotta make it fast. Jasmine has other offers. - Take the other offers. - Yeah, okay. You need to stop. That thing that's not a thing is over. What's wrong with Ruby? He's fine. He's just still bummed he had to give up his room. - Am I interrupting something? - Nope. Nothing. - Sorry, not trying to be weird. - But she can't help it. Ah. - So, after school, you wanna hang? - Wanna hang? - Oh, I have plans with Monse. - Oh, I'm happy to join. It's kind of a girl thing. Oh, can I watch? - I got to get to class. - Great. Bye. Just text me when you get out of sixth period. Okay. I'm sorry I wasn't talking to you. Let me give you my number, Olivia. - Is that a problem? - No, why would that be a problem? Hey. Hey. How's it going? Your friends are really cool. Monse gave me a tour and Cesar could not be any nicer. Yeah, he's a great dude. He's the best dude. He's better than me. Sorry. I don't want to be rude, but I got to finish this. Could you take a break for a sec? I know how much you've wanted this. Uh... You know? - I knew since the minute I met you. - You did? I did. So it's yours. Just... take it. How do I take it? My family's right outside. Shoot. Right. We need a plan. We got to explain why we did it. We have to tell them? - Yeah, it's gonna be obvious. - It is? Are you sure? It feels weird to include them. Now I'm not second guessing you. It's just I've never done this before. I'll stop talking. I'll follow your lead. So, should I take my clothes off or do you want to do that? I should take them off. I don't know if I know what you're talking about. Uh... what are you talking about? I want to give you your room back and I'll bunk with the twins. Oh! Oh, my room! Yes, my room! I love that idea. And yes, we need a solid plan, like bulletproof. No room for holes or my abuelita, 'cause she's no joke. Neither are my parents. They're not gonna be easy to convince. I know the kind. You know, I was too hasty. I don't want the room back. Seriously, it's drafty and I hate blankets. It's also really close to the bathroom, and you can hear everything. And I actually like my new digs. Plus... this looks good here. I know what you're doing. I'm not doing anything. Thank you, Ruben. Mmm. ♪ What's that love? ♪ ♪ What's that sound? ♪ ♪ That's my love dying for you... ♪ What's up? The plan to talk to Oscar wasn't all me. We strategized as a team. Okay. I heard you the first time. I wasn't the instigator. - Got it. - Wanted to make sure you knew that. - Loud and clear. - And I'm not a honey badger. Whatever you say. Good night. - Yes? - Are you sure you're sure? About what? What I said. - Yeah, you aren't the instigator. - Right. That all? Yep. Really? 'Cause you could've just sent that in a text. No. Tone is never properly conveyed through text. Ah. - What? - Olivia's really pretty, isn't she? I guess. I haven't noticed. Mmm. Right. Got it. Good night. I don't know what you "got," but don't flatter yourself, Cesar. This has nothing to do with jealousy. Don't walk away from me! Yes? - Synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com -
