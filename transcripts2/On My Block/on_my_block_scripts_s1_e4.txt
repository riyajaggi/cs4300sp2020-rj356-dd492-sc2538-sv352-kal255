 Rose Westbrook. Rose is Frankie's girlfriend. The one I made the dress for. She was the negrita dancer on the negrito dance show with the negrito choo choo. What's a negrito dance show and what's a negrito choo choo? I'm not your secretary. Use the Google. The... The what? You ask too many preguntas. Now it's time for you to find the answers. Váyase.

 Ah! She danced on Soul Train. That's what choo choo means. Eighty-six the chitchat and focus. This is gonna be our best shut-in ever. But we have to follow protocol. - Dude, we know the drill. - This year's different. It's not about our survival. It's about Olivia. There was magic in our first dance. You guys ever been to Brentwood? My parents are out so I set up touch control LED lighting. Bordello Red. And Nightmare on Elm Street is gonna get Olivia a little scared and a little lappy. - You know that's creepy, right? - One step ahead of you. - Little cover in case of wood. - Speaking of wood. Brentwood sounds kind of fun. - Where's Cesar sitting? - In Oscar's Impala. - He's not coming? Why? It's tradition. - Who cares? - I have the perfect one to one P/V ratio. - P/V ratio? Olivia and me. And Jamal and you. - Never ever put my V with Jamal's P. - Duly noted. Shut-in! - But I thought you were with Oscar. - Good to see you too. No, it's fine. It's just... Take a seat. Any seat. Not the love seat. And don't block my scented candle. What do you think? - That looks nice. - So, when are we going out? Never. Trick-or-treating in Freeridge is a no-go. Why? You might wanna sit down. I'll be brief. In 2012, Prophets rolled up on us. Glocks to our heads and snatched our bags. 2013 we were kissing pavement all night. Caught in a drive-by. That night, we lost our candy and perhaps our innocence. Can we talk? - Here the trick-or-treat threat level... - I'm good. - ...is always red. - That blows. So we're stuck inside? Brentwood. Why haven't you returned any calls or texts? Been busy. You know, tagging, jacking, banging. Even ran a yellow light. - You're still mad over my "safe" comment? - Not safe. Seriously? I said what I said and had to say it because if I didn't it, I'd have to say more, and saying more is not what I should've said. You're being overly sensitive. Want me to apologize? I want you to want to apologize, but you'd have to have feelings for that. Scary movies, artisan pizza, and most of all, new experiences. You're right. We should go out. I'm feeling like this could be our last Halloween trick-or-treating. And frankly, it's feeling a little cramped in here. You feel me? I vote for Brentwood. It's safe, rich, and I bet they've got full-size candy bars. Shut-ins are tradition. And I ordered the pizza. Did I mention it's artisanal? - Why can't we go somewhere else? - Brentwood. - There's gotta be other places. - Brentwood. - How about Brentwood? - I'm down. - Good call, Olivia. - It's a bad call. It's a great idea. It's just Brentwood's super far and we would have to take public transpo, - which sucks. - You've never been on the train. Sorry, guys, but I don't know how we'd even get there. All good. I got us a hook-up. Easy. That's my bad arm. Buena suerte. We don't need luck. It's Brentwood. Nothing bad happens here. How about OJ? No offense, Jamal. Oh, I'm good. We don't claim him. - So, we should be ready around 10:00. - Good for you, but I have plans. We are not in Freeridge anymore. - In 800 feet, you have arrived. - No. We've got lots of ground to cover, so... to maximize candy efficiency, let's divide and conquer, then split our booty. Great idea. Olivia and I will go this way. Meet back here around 10:00? Later. - Jamal! - Jamal! On second thought, I'll go with Ruby and Olivia. On third thought, you should go with Jamal and Monse. On fourth thought, we're good. Come on. This is really getting old. We're skipping all the big houses with crazy decorations and you want to hit up... Tootsie Rolls. What are you doing? Buckets equal self-service. Trick-or-treat! Baby, bucket equals self-service. - Happy Halloween. - Oh, my God! - Did you... Did you dance on Soul Train? - What do you know about Soul Train? It was only the dopest dance show ever. I mean, my mama loved it. My mama's mama loved it. And that dance line was the bomb. I invented the dance line. Wow, that's so cool! But we really should get going. A legend like you... - I bet you've got stories for days. - Well... - Damn! Is that a gold record? - Mm-hmm. Would it be too much if I asked for a selfie in front of it? You know, for my mama's mama. Well, we can't keep your mama's mama hanging. Come on. Dude, let the little kids go first. Cesar tends to be one-track. You know, loses sight of others. Me? I'm a gentleman. I prefer to give before I receive. Hold on, still one more little one. So cute. And now what you're looking at is the first dancer to have a number one hit. That's dope, Rose. Actually, it's pronounced Ro-say. Oh. - After your favorite wine? - No. After this other bitch named Rose started dancing on the Train. Oh, I'm blowing up. So, what was Don Cornelius like? Child, rest his soul. The man was handsy. Couldn't keep his fingers off this jelly. Is that why you left the Train for Solid Gold? Oh, no, baby. I left for the green. Plus my moves ain't free. And I was tired of living in a sugar shack. So you bought that place in Sherman Oaks. Yeah, I... How did you know? Where else would a lady baller like you live? I read that it was like the Paris of the Valley back in the day. So how'd you get started? Dance school? No, more like dance parties. Or any place they played music, like the Florentine Gardens, Osko's... - Oh, RollerWorld. - RollerWorld? Yeah, you know it? I've heard about it once or twice. Oh! Time's up. My chili's ready. Our time's up too. We need to go. Baby. Baby, hold up. I'll be right back. RollerWorld? That's why we came to Brentwood? So you could Dateline this shit? Jamal, we're leaving now or I'm gonna kill you. That's exactly what I was thinking. Ruby, isn't it nice not to have to look over your shoulder for once? Damn. We forgot Ruby. Where's Ruby? Back here, asshole. Uh... Give me a sec. - What's your problem? - What's my problem? What's your problem? You just confused me with a nine-year-old, who admittedly is big for her age. And what's with the cock-blocking? I W-4'd Olivia. As in I claimed her. And I'm working on getting my first kiss tonight, and don't need you to do that thing. - What thing? - That thing. I mean, that thing you do with your face... when you say words... with your mouth. Don't be you! This was supposed to be my night. - I had the perfect P/V ratio. - The what? Penis to vagina ratio. Calm down. I'm not into Olivia, okay? Then quit working against me and talk me up. Hey, everything cool? Most def. Hey, did you know Ruby crushes one-arm push-ups? Show her, Ruby. You know what would be crazy cool? If we crashed that party. I don't know. They look like they're at capacity. We don't wanna create a fire hazard. - Will you excuse us again? - Yeah. If you don't want me to be me, you need to not be you. Me? What's wrong with me? "I don't know. They look like they're at capacity, and we don't wanna create a fire hazard." She just said she wants to go to the party. For once, be Outside Ruben and take her to the party. Come on. New plan. Let's tear that party up! Yes. Are you casing my place? You think I'm a fool? I saw you taking pictures. And you're asking way too many questions. You better come correct, boy. Don't look at me. If I had a gun, I'd shoot you myself. Is the RollerWorld heist real? Are the rumors true? Is there still money out there? You want the skinny on RollerWorld? What's in it for me? Everyone here's so friendly. I told someone I was from Freeridge and got major props. Hood must be trending. Here are some napkins and lemon wedges. You're so thoughtful and always such a gentleman. Gentleman, scholar, and a damn good swimmer too. Excuse me, it's time for my adventure to find the bathroom and wait in a long line. Okay, so thanks for propping me up. Just a small note, the swimmer comment was a little much. Great intent, but a bit of a stretch. Think grounded. Point taken, Mr. Gentleman. Ah, I know, right? Looks like this gentleman is gonna get his throat tickled. Wrong euphemism, dude. Um... Who amongst us aced Gifted English? It's "among." Among, amongst. One's a variant of the other. Oh, no, I totally zoned out on Jamal and Monse. Send them our location. You sure? You know how Monse is. She'll start problems with her mouth. No, not tonight. We're like rock stars here. - Yo, Amy! - What's up, Ruby? Is this enough? Ooh, perfect. Now, come show these wine glasses some love. How we doing on the cheese? I need you to grate all that. I got the whole block coming for my chili. Damn, I haven't seen these boys in years. Mm. Who's that playa? - Is he wearing a fishnet crop top? - Okay. Yes. That's Frankie. Fine as hell. But dumb as dirt, hear? That's why him and Benito... Now, Benito's the one with the flavor saver... That's why they got pinched for RollerWorld. You don't go flashing green when the blue is onto you. And they loved flashing the green. Even leased me a Trans Am, which unfortunately, was yellow. So, he spent all the money? Far as I know, there wasn't that much to spend. So, there could be more. - Who's that other guy? - This one is Lil' Ricky. Was he part of the heist too? No. He was too smart for that. But if he was into it, he was way too smart to get busted. They were all so tight. They started the Freeridge Santos. You dated a Santo? What was that like? - Isn't that a little personal? - Said the stalker. I don't mind. Come on over here, baby. Have a seat. Get the lady a drink, Jamal. Yeah, Jamal. This lady's thirsty. Do you mind if I ask you a question? Oh, honey, you can ask me anything. Did you ever feel unsafe dating someone in The Life? No, baby. Frankie kept me out of all that stuff, 'cause that's what a real man does. Frankie. He was the love of my life. But he couldn't escape who he was. He was a Santo. And if you're gonna be with a Santo, then you gotta take the good with the bad. And appreciate what you got, '- cause it can be gone... - ...just like that. When Frankie got locked up, Lil' Ricky made sure I got this. This was Frankie's high school championship ring. Proudest moment in their life was winning that football game. Wait, is this all fall down? All fall down, baby! We still do that. So, RollerWorld... Let's just say there was a third person and it was Lil' Ricky... Baby, are you still on that? I told you he wasn't involved. Listen, Lil' Ricky was on a higher plane. Hear? He was the one that took the Santos from street hustlers to major players. - You need a lot of money to do that. - It was the '80s. - All you needed was a short stack. - So maybe someone kept the rest. Anything's possible. - You two were the cutest couple. - Mm-hmm. You got that right. It ain't gonna refill itself, sweetie. What's taking Olivia so long? She's dropping a deuce. Everybody poops. - What's wrong with you? - What's up, locos? I heard you're from the 'ridge too. Yo, check it. Ah! Just clowning! Yeah, I'm straight from B-Wood. Westside! So, what do you think of my fits? And my tat? It's pretty dope, right? Moms works in hair and makeup. I mean, it's like life imitating art and art imitating life, right? - Hey. - Hey. - Where'd you get that? - From the fridge. That's my mom's pressed juice. - Oh, I'm sorry. - She's on a cleanse. She knows exactly how many bottles there are. I had no idea. I just wanted a drink and I just assumed... What? That you could just go in and take it? There are drinks everywhere. There's a whole bin of soda right there. - Why were you in the fridge? - I was thirsty. It's just juice. It's not a big deal. Don't tell me what's not a big deal, okay? Do people go in your house, take stuff out of your fridge? Yeah. What the hell is wrong with you people? - You people? - Hey, just let it go. - Don't you have any respect? - Respect? - Says the white boy dressed like a cholo. - Excuse me? You sure you can't stay for the party? You barely even sampled the goods. Thanks, Rosé, but we really should meet up with our friends. All right. You be good, hear? Come here. Mmm. Listen, give your guy a chance. - What guy? - The one you're in love with. You'll regret it if you don't. Okay? Julia! Hey, girl. I'm so glad you made it. And who do you have with you? Hope you made enough. We're hungry. - Come on. - Come on, babies. Look at you. I love your costume. - Come on. - We got Tootsie Rolls. I made chili. Excuse me? Excuse me? Hey, we don't want any problems. Exactly. You know, I got her. Let me pay for the juice. Okay. Okay, it's 52 dollars a bottle, and then another 20 each for all the food and drinks you had. - We don't have that kind of money on us. - Of course you don't. - What's that supposed to mean? - I'm just stating the obvious. Now you're just being a dick. Oh. Dude, you better control your bitch. - Dude, he thinks she's my bitch. - You better apologize. - No. He doesn't have to apologize. - Exactly. So, how are we gonna settle up? Like this. So, there was a third guy at RollerWorld. Lil' Ricky. We need to find him. Do you think it was little with an apostrophe or little like Lil Wayne or little like Little Women? - Run! - I don't know. - Get out of here! - Run! - Run! - Run? - Why? - Why? Ah! Ah! Run! Run! Get out of here! Back to where you came from! Yeah! And don't come back. You guys, this is all my fault. I let that asshole get the best of me. Don't apologize. We just got to get home. Jamal, get a Lyft. My dad said Lyft was only for emergencies. Seriously? What exactly constitutes an emergency? Don't get a Lyft. It's handled. It's handled. You want some more? Oh, you think you're hard. Okay. I'm not. But he is. This shit's real. Please. What do you want? I can't believe Monse went home! Although she is covered in egg. But she's missing out on our jackpot. Hey, I'm gonna bounce. Later. Olivia, it's still early. You up for Nightmare on Elm Street? - Sure. - Great. Gonna take a quick shower then we can get our scare on. Cesar. Thank you. Good night. Screw that kid. He was just some rich asshole showing off. He's not the problem. No matter how hard I try, I can't escape who I am. Those kids in Brentwood, they don't think we're people. They think we're costumes. And I played right into the stereotype. You're being too hard on yourself. You stood up for your friends. For me. You did the right thing. It doesn't feel that way. You did nothing wrong. I'm sorry. Hey. You don't need to apologize. Let's just, you know, hit reset. Forget either one of us said anything. And when you get a sec, call me. I think I just saw my mom.
