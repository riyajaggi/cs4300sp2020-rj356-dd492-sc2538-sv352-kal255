 Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com What? What is it? Stay here with your cell phone. Everything's okay. Was it one of those dreams? I'll fix you some hot tea. Are you mad at me? Mad at you? For what? For running away. I thought you'd understand the note.

 I... thought I'd be back in a few days. I... I forgot about the note. They're not like other dreams, the premonitions. I wake up from them with these nosebleeds. I've had them since I was a little girl. And I know... I know that it sounds nuts, but I feel that something terrible is coming and-and if I can just solve the puzzle of the premonition on time maybe I can... stop it from happening. Do you think I'm crazy? Where-Where did the dream take place? It's a big space. The ceilings are really high. There's... a lot of glass.

 Kind of like the space we're in now? No, the light's different and... there's a... clanking sound. Like a metallic... like silverware. Mmm-hmm. Uh, the moment that I catch it, it just disappears. That's okay. Sometimes it's best not to push. But I need to know. These, uh... These dreams occur at important junctures in your life. You're gonna say that it's anxiety or stress or... No, no, no. Nothing so reductive. I'm just wondering if your subconscious is trying to help you out. You're a small child, about to realize your all-powerful father is in danger. Then you're 21, officially an adult. It seems these are junctures... - But the bus dream did come true. - Sure. But what if psychic just means your mind is able to pick up on even the subtlest cues in the world around you? I don't understand. You're gathering information the whole time. You don't realize it, but you are. I mean, even as a little girl. So... maybe your mind is picking up on all these cues, and using these dreams to process them. So, it's the mission. I'm trying to prepare myself for the mission. Could be. Or... maybe... You're talking to these boys. You're talking to me. Your parents are giving you space to heal. It's another juncture. I think so. The first time, I ignored the instinct. I had the premonition, but I didn't connect it to the bus. I was too young to understand. The second time, I thought I solved the puzzle. I got all the way to New York City and my father wasn't there. I... I got it wrong. Now, I'm having this new dream. I don't understand what it is, I don't know what it means, and I don't know what to do. Maybe this time just accept it. Whatever happens, just claim it. I can't. - I feel like the pain is just too big. - Hey. Hey, you know why we, uh... why we like to be hugged? The way I see it, it sets a limit on the pain. You know? Puts a perimeter around it. How big can the pain be, really? Accept it? This is where I am now. I wonder if he's getting anywhere with her. It's been over an hour. It's a nice place. You've never seen it? I usually drop her in the... the parking lot by the café. Well, you should walk her in. Yes, dear. Poor henpecked Abel. Did Prairie leave a note? When she disappeared, was there any note? A note? No. What...? They're coming. Good to see you again, Mr. Johnson. You must be Mrs. Johnson. Elias Rahim, nice to meet you. I suppose you know all about us. Oh, we're just getting started. Can we have a private word? I'm not sure that would be such a good idea, but if it's okay with you, we can all just talk now? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah? I'm sure you heard what happened last night. No, what happened? Prairie woke up screaming. She's had these night terrors ever since she was a girl. Her nose bleeds and, um... it's quite terrifying for her. Our family doctor, years ago, prescribed medication... It didn't work. - It helped a little. - Can I stop you for a moment? I'm not a pharmacologist or doctor of any kind. I'm just a listener. I'm here to... help with the transition as a victim specialist. Um... you guys are victims too. I mean, you've suffered tremendously. Just making it through the day right now, it's a huge achievement for all of you. If I could suggest, it might be nice for you guys to do something together. Something you might do if she were home from school or back after a long trip. Something to help normalize your family life. Thank you for that... for that advice. Maybe we'll try that. Take care. All the best. See you tomorrow, OA. Why stick around here when you don't have to? Got my projects. Oh, yeah? Like what? I'm into parkour. You like computers? - You know, as a thing. - "As a thing"? For a job and shit. You know. Guaranteed to make bank. Always gonna be computers. Yeah... same, you know. Stunts and shit. Maybe a personal trainer. Always gonna be movies and TV. People wanna look good naked. Right. Not bad for a couple of the dumb kids. Yo, can I see? Okay, whatever. Here at the Alternative School, you can pick your subjects and work at your own pace. Pretty neat. Shall we get started? Fuck me in the butt. Fuck me in the butt. Fuck me in the butt. Fuck me in the butt. Great job! Click the button at the bottom of the page to see how you did. I like your laugh. If I laugh again, 'cause that's so fucking corny, do I get another kiss? Let me see some more of your shit first. Are you gonna dump pig's blood on my head at prom? Not unless you think that's hot. You remember that STD assembly Gilchrist did last fall? ♪ I want your body ♪ ♪ Everybody wants your body... ♪ Hey, yo, wait up! - Hey, Steve. - Sorry I'm late. You're not late. We haven't even gotten to the house yet. Right. Yo, where'd you get that protein bar? I'm starving. You know that feeling in winter, when you can, like, always eat something? Is that 'cause, like, eating creates warmth? Uh, I got it from French. That was my last one. - Oh, that's cool, I'm good. - I can split it with you, if you want. - Thanks, Buck. - Oh. God. Okay. - Oh. My bad. - Come on. Hey, BBA! - Oh, thank you. - Come on! You're the best. Were you just tickled or something? - What? - Were you just tickled? Yeah, or, like, force-fed a bunch of candy? Steve was just with a girl. Jesse, shut up. Is it Kathy with a K? I like her. Oh, which one's Kathy with a K? Is she a senior? No, she's a junior. She's cute. Has kind of a baby nose. A baby nose? Is that a thing? I hate all of you. Steve, you wanna start us off? You wanna take us through the second movement? Homer's movement? Uh... Has everyone stretched a little? All right, everybody take a deep breath in... ...and then go and fuck yourselves. All right, uh... Homer's movement, the second, but really slow to start. On this one, is it a breath in or a breath out? Start here. No, you, uh... you gotta keep your wrists, like, just a little tighter, you know? Yeah, I don't know. I can't do that. Try like... Like you've got rope around your wrists and you wanna, like, break it, you know? Sometimes you just gotta tell yourself it's easy and then it'll feel easy. You know? Yeah, like forcing yourself to smile until you feel happy. Now keep repeating it over and over. Think about how long Homer and OA did it for. Hey, you join a sports team? No, I just played a game of pickup basketball with some friends. Well, I've been on the phone all afternoon. - Oh, yeah? - Had to shell out $5,000 to the Brekovs. Rebecca Brekov was screaming bloody murder at me for two goddamn hours. She had no idea how her son hurt his throat until she saw some subtweet online and Miles finally admitted that you punched him. If I didn't offer to pay their medical deductible, she was gonna call the police and sue us. All right, let me take a shower. I'll get my thoughts in order and then we can talk this out, all right? I'll... I'll sit down with you and... we can figure something out. I messed up, all right? Look, I'll be back down. I fucked up. I messed up. I was... I was jealous. Angry. Felt like shit. I wanted to hurt someone. I fucked up. I've just been driving around with the check. I don't want to cash it. I... I mean, it's so strange. It would make more sense if my brother had written it, but he didn't. The lawyer did. Yeah, but the check feels like a piece of Theo. It makes sense. Yeah. What are you gonna do with it? Oh, I need new appliances. My fridge is ten years old. Maybe I'll buy one of those TVs connected to the Internet. I don't know. I... I hate to let go of the check. I mean, it's the piece of paper, not the money. I... You know, when I was little, Nancy and Abel took me to the Natural History Museum, to this exhibit on totems. There was an audio tour. I loved it. I made them take me back twice. And it was all about how cultures that have survived more loss, like harsh weather or earthquakes, they have more totems. Objects carry meaning in difficult times. Um... In your place you went, in your NDE, do you think that was purgatory? I believe in heaven, in angels. But I was thinking about it last night as I was falling asleep, the darkness. I don't think it was purgatory, but... I don't think we can understand, you know? I know, why do we always try to understand? The future is dark. Not dark, like, bad. Just dark. You can't see it. And maybe living is just... bringing light to what you need in a day. - Just... - Mmm. ...seeing the day. Or at least that's what I'm learning in therapy. You tell him things? The therapist? Yeah. It feels good... not to have to carry it all the time. Yeah. Yeah. So, um... Will this be dangerous? What do you mean? I mean, when we take you to Homer... I mean, what will happen? Will we... will we travel too? I don't know that I'm ready to go to another dimension. Oh, I don't think it's like that. I think it's... The force of the movements, done with perfect feeling, just opens something that's already here. Like an invisible river that carries you away. But you have to jump in. You have to want to jump in. Where will it take you? I don't know. - The future is... - Dark. Yeah. I was stupid. I'm trying to take responsibility. I'll pay it back, I promise. Let's go. We're on a schedule. - Stop! Stop! - Put me down! Put me down! Stop! Relax. Go. Get in. You got him? Get in. Principal Gilchrist, I told you already, you shouldn't have called his parents. They turned around and called Asheville. You should have stayed out of it. I... I mean, I just don't understand why you would put this boy through more heartache. Like I'm not supposed to not tell a parent when we learn of a kid's misconduct through social media? I just think it's an extremely rash and, frankly, unprofessional reaction to a troubled boy. He broke a kid's throat, Betty. That was before. Before what? That was before we met at the house. - What? - I mean... That was before... - I... I mean... - Before what, Betty? I gotta go. I... I'm eating a sandwich. - You're eating a what? A sandwich? - Yeah, I'll... I'll see you tomorrow. - I gotta go, Principal Gilchrist. - Betty? Betty? It's... it's BBA. Uh, what? Table for three. Johnson. I think I'm just going to get what I always do. - Shrimp Alfredo? - Yep. Prairie, you having your usual? Usual? - Five cheese... - Oh, the ziti? Yeah, I'll get that. I think I'm gonna try the stuffed mushrooms. That sounds good. You know, I think Byron got that once. What? What? Byron was a good kid. How could you possibly remember what he ordered? I remember it. I remember it because he called 'em "shrooms." Come on, he was nice. I said he was a good kid. Byron. Not like the kid had ever tried a drug in his life. - Abel. - I can tell you, that's entirely true. How long did you two date? Oh, I don't know. Four months or something? I don't think he liked me. He liked you. Of course he liked you. I mean, maybe he liked that I couldn't see him. Well, he wasn't winning any awards in the looks department. He had that... - that funny little moustache thing. - The moustache. He had a nice personality. He brought me flowers from his little garden on Mother's Day. That was nice. It was nice that you invited him to family dinner. Well, he was your boyfriend. You should friend Byron on Facebook. See what he looks like now. She doesn't have a Facebook. Hi, sorry, um, you're the Michigan Miracle, right? Prairie Johnson? - Oh, uh... - Can I take a picture with you? Why? - She was blind. - We're having dinner. - It'll just take a second. - Nance... - Well, we are. - Thank you. Sorry. Um... you're such an inspiration, really. I mean... to be beaten like that and raped. I can't even imagine. You look so pretty in person. Uh... thanks. I'm gonna go back there and make her delete it. Nancy, let's just have a good time. Where's she coming from, thinking she can just... Like she knows something about our lives. - She doesn't know anything. - Exactly. - She said that she was beaten and... - I know. Some people... - It's just a picture. - It is not okay. - Waitress? - Do you look like you've got bruises? Do you look like you've been beaten? - Excuse me. - Shh. - Excuse me. - Yes? - Uh, could we have one of those? - Yes. Could we have some water, please? Uh, sure, of course. If you kick anything, I will fucking end you. I'm tired. Good. Why don't you, uh, go pick out a drink. One. Can I help you? That's, uh, a unique name. How do you say that? Mickey. - Guy's name. - My name's actually McKayla. Steven. - What are you... - I followed you. Thank fucking God, BBA, I'm freaked. - I'm fucking freaked. - I know, sweetie, I know. I'm gone. I'm outta here. Not if you listen to me closely, Steven, okay? You're going to say you have to go to the bathroom. I put an out of order sign on it. Say you have to go bad and you have to go to the side of the road. I'll be nearby. You say that they're molesting you. And you have to shout that no matter how embarrassing that sounds. - Okay, Steven? - Are you fucking insane? Just listen. You say they're molesting you. Then I'll back it up. 'Cause I'm just an onlooker. They beat the shit out of me in front of my own parents and they stood there like I'm some rabid dog. I know, Steven. I know. I know. Do you get the plan? Yeah. Yeah, I say they're touching my dick and you come and get me. - Oh, don't say it like that. - What? Why? Because it sounds like it's your fantasy and you're making it up. - A dude? - People are gay, Steven. I know people are gay. Okay, well, we can't look like we know each other. And what if it doesn't work? Steven. - Let's go. - Yeah. - Yo, I gotta piss. - What? I gotta piss. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Uh, there was an out of order sign. - Are you fucking with me, you little rat? - Please. For Christ's sakes, man, you're gonna have to take him behind the fucking soda machine. Hurry up. Hurry up. - Come on. - We're late. All right... That man is molesting that boy! He's... He... He's molesting him. Stop it. Stop what you're doing. Stop molesting him! - What the fuck, lady? I wasn't doing shit. - I saw you! - You're out of your mind. - The fuck's going on? - Just get in the fucking van. - You can't just get away with that. That man is molesting that boy! I saw you. I'm calling the police! I have your plate numbers! - Who the fuck is she, bro? You hit her? - No, man, she's fuckin' insane. Lady, we've got papers signed by that kid's parents, all right? We're a reform school. Well, the last I checked, molestation is illegal in all 50 states. You were ten feet away. What the fuck do you think you saw, lady? She's nutso. You're fucking nutso. We have a job to do. - Get out of here. - Get in the fucking van. Get in there. Back the fuck up or we'll run you over. No. No. Stop! Stop! - She's fucking bat-shit crazy. - Stop! Stop! Stop, please! I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. Stop, I have something! I have something! I have something you'll want. - What do you have? - Okay. Okay. There's... - It's $50,000. - What? - $50,000. - It's $50,000. A cashier's check. I'll give it to you. $50,000. Let me see that. - Is this real? - Just let him go. Yes. - Look at this. - $50,000? Get out. I'm gonna make her delete the picture. Nancy. - She could put it online. - Nance, drop it. Abel, it's her face. She could put it online for... for everyone to see. - Saying that you were... - Nancy. What? What? I'm being crazy? I'm being the crazy one? 'Cause I don't want that stupid girl to have our daughter's picture to do anything she wants with it? Is that... Is that what you want? Do you want your picture online for all the world to see? I don't... I don't know. - She just came over suddenly... - No. No, really, tell me. Do you want everyone to see that? To imagine anything they want? Imagine all the ways that you were abused, beaten, hurt, starved? To let... to let their imaginations run wild? People-People-People getting off on this. Showing their friends. Thinking they know. Thinking they know everything about you. I don't even know. I don't know anything. I don't know anything! Were you in a house? Were you outside? I don't know anything! Mom. Mom, it's okay. Why do you smell like that? Is that him? Do you smell like him? Nance, we have to... What are these? Who did that to you? I did. I did. They are two notations of the five movements to open another dimension. I know, because I am the Original Angel. You need to get out of here, OA? - Come on. - What is... Prairie. Prairie. Prairie? Prairie! Every night you've told us about your life. What shaped you, what frightened you... what brought you back here to Crestwood. You told us about your father in Russia. About living on a gated place on the hill. You told us about being sent away from the person you loved. You told us about the feeling you had... when you realized he wasn't at the Statue of Liberty. And the feeling of relief when Hap was. About how, at first, he felt like the father figure you were looking for. You know? Strong, smart... uncompromised. And how you followed him into the dark. Into the basement where you would create a new family. Scott, Rachel, Homer... and even Renata. And how with that family, you found insight. A way to find the light within the dark. And... we know we're taking their place. But, in all of that... ...you never really told us about them. Them? They rescued you from a hard life. They raised you. I mean, you think you're here because of us, and... in a way you are. - But you're also here because of them. - They medicated me. - I know. - They thought I was crazy. They're not my parents. But they are your parents. You could have stayed with Khatun. With your father. But... you chose to come back. I didn't choose to come to Crestwood. Well, maybe you did. Maybe this is the missing piece. OA! Where are you? OA! Where is she? I don't know, there's no one here. - Where's the rest of them? - I have no idea, man. Steve. What's happening? My parents had me fucking kidnapped by those goons. Okay. Calm down. Fuck being calm! And fuck your bullshit. Calm down. You're just like all the rest of them. You don't give a fuck. We're just your slave labor so you can leave us for your fucking boyfriend. We're just a retarded pit stop for you. Don't fucking touch me, bitch. You saw me do some fucking flips and thought, "This guy"? No. No. No! What? Why? How... How did you survive so long down there? I survived because I wasn't alone. Tonight, I will finish telling my story. Are you ready? Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com
