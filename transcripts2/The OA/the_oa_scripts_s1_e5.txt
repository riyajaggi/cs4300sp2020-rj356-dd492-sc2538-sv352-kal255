 Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com Four, three, two... one. Oh, God. Ten more. Then we go again. Hey! - Hey! - There's no one out there, Scott. - It's not right. - No, maybe it is! I feel like... where my movement ends, your movement begins. Maybe they're connected, like pieces of a puzzle.

 It's like that, it's just sharper more. The fingers open and bend almost like they're broken and just hanging. Why don't you just break your fucking fingers, man? Hey! Scott, maybe we should let Rachel sleep. No, she's... She gonna be out cold for at least another day. I'll bet you he's making the gas stronger. Maybe she's got a movement inside her. Let's see, you got a bird, he's got a sea creature. I wonder what's next. I mean, what'd you... What'd you think? You think... You think you're gonna break your fingers back...

 and... and this glass is gonna melt? And a... and a door in the rock is gonna open and we're just gonna follow a yellow brick road right out of here? 'Cause of some movements that you fucking hallucinated? How did you explain your NDE to people in Pittsburgh? I didn't. Why, because people would think you're insane? No, because I knew better than to talk about things you can't talk about. That's it. I have no idea how to talk about this. - That's why we're just doing it. - Doing what? Getting us out of here. And when Rachel wakes up, maybe she'll try it, too, - and then and maybe you will. - Prairie... I liked you better when you were blind. Sorry, I don't speak Spanish. Please. Are you a feminist? Uh, I like symmetry. You were at the concert. I saw you. I didn't think you saw anyone. I don't look in the beginning, but at the end, I take in the crowd. It's like sleeping with a stranger and then asking their name on the way out the door. To validate the intimacy. Or to invalidate it. Hmm. You're a wordsmith. Like your father. You know him? I know his work. You are a poet. - No, I'm a scientist. - Hmm. That's obscure work for a scientist to know. It's part of my study. What do you study? You. And people like you. Your uncanny skill level, given how long you've been playing, is miraculous to your audience. It's inexplicable. Not to me. It's a simple scientific connection... explained... by your travels. I've never been off this island. Your travels in death. How do you know that? Three years ago you drowned, then took up guitar. It is not a miracle. It is economics. I'm just a poor girl trying to escape poor circumstances. Well, I can help with that. I have a plane, and I can guarantee you safe passage to America in exchange for limited participation in my study. I don't want to be examined. I prefer to remain unknown, even to myself. The mind is a sticky thing. We have found that what we have long thought to be everything is only a small part of a grander whole, only one piece of a much wider cosmos. And to, really, kind of communicate that idea, we've introduced this new terminology that our universe is just one of many universes, populating, possibly, a grander multiverse. Then you're on the verge of a scientific revolution. This would be, of course, a huge revolution. It's a revolution in a way that would complete a meta-revolution that's been in the making for five centuries. You know, a long time ago, we all know that we thought that the Earth was the center of everything. Then Copernicus comes along and we learn that, no, the Earth is going around the sun, and then later, we learn the sun is one of many stars in our galaxy, one of hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy. Then we learn that our galaxy is... Don't stop on my account. Aren't we allowed to do some fucking exercises? Exercise, sure. What is that? What is that thing you're doing? Where does that come from? - We made them up. - No. No, I don't think you did, Rachel. All respect that's due, Hap. Um, how the fuck would you know what we make up and what we don't? No, I don't know, but I can find out, Scott, as you're all well aware. So, somebody please tell me what's going on right now. Right now! Scott? This isn't helping anyone! Help! Rachel? - Help! Help! - Rachel. Rachel, calm down. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Help! Help! Hey! Hey, Stan. What was that racket? Ah, it's just heavy metal. Helps me concentrate. Go figure. So... how you doing? What... what, uh... Was just about to take a break. - Will you smoke with me? - No, thanks. I'm fine. Listen, Hap, I feel bad just coming up here, but you're not exactly listed in the phone book, uh... Oh, yeah, that's... that's intentional. Oh, big city doctor in search of peace and quiet. Yeah, I get that. I... I really do. I tell you, I never thought I'd see this old mine looking so... so homey. Well, I like to maintain. You know, I figure order outside will generate order inside. Yeah? Hmm. Your timber here needs a bit a work. You'll wanna get that done before the rain comes in spring. Right, thanks. Well, uh, will do. Let me know if you need some help. Is there something I can help you with today, Stan? You don't come around much, and... You know my wife, Evelyn. We've been struggling with her illness. ALS is a merciless disease. It's... I don't know how much more of this she can take. It became impossible for her to walk and grasp things, but we still talked and talked. She could laugh. But now... it's just so goddamn lonely. It's like I'm living in a haunted house. I can only imagine. She's completely trapped in her own body. It's like she's living in a cage. She can blink, "yes..." she can blink, "no," but that's it. Now, we're not crazy. We just need a little bit of hope. I don't know what to tell you, Stan, it's... It's irreversible. I can't candy coat it. It's a slow... painful death. It's what it is, I'm sorry. Uh, I feel foolish driving up here. But, um... you're a doctor. I'd feel even more of a fool if I didn't try. Sure, no, I'm... I'm glad you came up. Uh... why don't I, um, look into it, see if there's any new research, or cutting edge things coming out of Europe. They have less regulation than us, you never know. We'd appreciate that. I'm glad you stopped by. Stan, it's good to see you. I'll... I'll do whatever I can. - He took him. - I didn't hear the gas. He took him upstairs. Police say seven people were killed after a shooter opened fire inside a shopping mall on Tuesday evening. Authorities are searching for the suspected shooter, whom they say left the scene... ...before the police arrived. He was last seen walking towards... Oh, so that's how they beat him? The fucking Paleo Diet? You know, bad language obscures rather than clarifies, Steven. Just tell us what's bothering you. Okay, OA eats a bird, then Homer eats a starfish, and that's how they get the movements? Homer didn't eat a starfish. Look, which fish is not the issue. Well, it makes sense if you just think about it. Oh, is this that invisible self shit? Swallow before you speak. I'm not on the lacrosse team. I never learned to swallow. Okay, easy, boys. Okay, but what's Hap gonna do to Homer? Well, we know Homer's alive, 'cause OA wants to find him. That doesn't mean he can't be, like, brain damaged, or lose his legs. Or maybe this is it. When Homer gets trapped, maybe it's the end of her story. Shit. I gotta go. You can't just drop a bomb like that and cut out. No, I'm gonna be late for practice again. See you guys later. Uh, French, hey... Ready for the big night? Yeah. That's, um, that's quite an interesting group you're sitting with. Hey, I sort of, uh, pride myself on my high school anthropology. But for the life of me... I can't imagine what the five of you have in common. Hey, man, what happened to your head? Oh... it's nothing. - You sure? You okay? - Yeah. Fine. Lacrosse. Yeah, 'course. See you at the scholarship dinner. How do you know what's right? What do you mean? Like, even just bringing this game, it's kind of dangerous to make a mistake. Where do you find the confidence to guide another person? It's just a combination of instinct and training, like anything, I guess. Could life experience work like training? Yeah, over time. But you'd start out making a ton of rookie mistakes. Nice and slow. You're training for something? You know I have a mission. Mmm. What makes you so sure the FBI can't help with it? Can't help those other captives? They're gone. As in, passed? No, off the board. You worried the same thing might happen to you? I want it to happen to me. Should I be worried, then? I don't want you taken off the board. The more days that pass here, the more I think it couldn't have happened. Hey, I saw the medical reports, okay? Vitamin D deficiency, dental decay, metal residue. Copper in those scars on your back? You did not imagine it. I couldn't have imagined love. Well, can I ask, is he or she one of the captives you left behind? - He is. - Okay, so let's accept, for a minute, your claim the FBI can't help him. Does that mean you have to do it alone? Oh, I'm not alone. ♪ She lies and says She's in love with him ♪ ♪ Can't find a better man ♪ ♪ She dreams in color She dreams in red ♪ ♪ Can't find a better man ♪ ♪ Can't find a better man ♪ I wish I could sing. Can't carry a tune in a bag. Still, what do you do with a choir voice? I mean, career-wise, I mean, we're all about industry here. Michigan's economy is ranked, what, 13th in the nation now? Yes, sir. GM, Dow, Whirlpool. Lot of potential for you there. Definitely. But, if I were you, I'd look into politics. Situation with the demographic now? A smart kid like you, put yourself right into the statehouse. - Thank you. - I'd vote for ya! Thank you. Um, could you excuse me for a second? Uh, sorry, I should really go see where my mom is. And he loves his mama. Where do I sign the check? He's a good kid. Wine all over the place, carpet stained. Well, you... Next time, you have to use Tide Ultra. - Tide? - Yeah, it'll take it all out. - Tide Ultra? - Mom. - Yeah! - Tide? Mom. - Alfonso! Hi, baby. - You missed half the dinner. People are starting to go. Okay, I'll go inside. I'm just enjoying my cigarette. Okay? Go. I'm Chris. I'm Peyton's dad. Okay, say bye to your friends, and that fat teacher who talked my ear off. I'm gonna grab my coat. Can I get you anything? - Uh, yeah... - No, she's fine. What is wrong with you? He's married, okay? All the fucking dads here are married. Why're you telling me the fucking dads are, like I am some child? No, you know, this was supposed to be the one night. What? You want another medal? Mom... ...I'm the one who has two jobs because you can't work. - Mmm. - But it's crazy to expect you to act like an adult for once. Just... What? Just what? I don't even know. I have worked so hard for this... Yes, you've worked so hard, but you do not know what life is, Alfonso. You don't know how hard it really gets. What, you don't think I had dreams like yours? I lived in Paris, but I... I'm here with you. Is that so bad? No, no. Listen, you are strong, yes. But you do not know everything, okay? You only see what I haven't done. But what about what I have given you? What I have done? Giving you some kind of life that can make this happen. Okay, I... I'm proud of you, yes. You got this medal, but... you don't need this to be the man you will be. Okay? You will be the man you will be no matter what. Okay? Buck, can you grab my bag? Come on. Can you stand? - Mmm. - Come on. Are we the good guys, Buck? Yeah, what do you mean? I mean, even Hap was young at some point. Like a doctor in some ER. And before that, he was a kid in a medical school somewhere. And before that, probably played in the high school band. What if, I don't know... we change? No... We won't change like that. No way. Hi, guys. Hey. People who want power will always try to control those who truly possess it. Hap didn't know what was going on in the basement, but he knew it was dangerous to allow it to continue. It gave us strength, unity, and he knew Homer was the linchpin. What happens next is hard to hear. Because it's... hard to understand how confusing freedom is when you've been a prisoner for so long, how hard it is to grasp that you have choice, that you can act, how unimaginable the sun is if you've been living underground for years. What? Where are we going? You're gonna help me with something. If anything happens to me, your friends all die in the laboratory. They starve to death down there. So, bear that in mind. Oh, there's a microphone in your shirt. So, I'll be with you at every stage. Please don't talk too loudly. You'll give me a headache. I'm in danger. I'm in serious, serious danger. Please, just help. I need... We need to call the police. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please hurry. - Sí, sí. - No, no, no, no. No, no. Who are you calling? Who are you... They said you were having some kind of breakdown. I told them about my son, of course. The golden boy with the brain damage from the football injury. They're worried about you. Now, come on, Homer. We're having a nice time, aren't we? All you have to do is convince her to come up to your room. Then you can have a nice long sleep with the window open and the ocean breeze blowing through. I'm gonna call... Who? Who you gonna call? - The FBI. - And tell them what, exactly? That you keep us in a cellar. Where's that? A mine. An abandoned mine. - A mine. - Yeah. That should be easy to find. Well, how many of them could there be? With that kind of dust, and those kinds of trees? What, a hundred? Approximately 500,000 in North America. But the FBI, they would... they would find them. They would search all over the country in, like, 24 hours. No, less than 12 hours. They'd figure it out, they'd find you, and... and they'd rescue them. You're a smart boy, Homer. Use your brain. The FBI are not coming to Cuba. They're not coming to get you and they're not coming to get me. And if you somehow prevent me from getting back there, you would starve Prairie and all your friends to death. Is that what you want? - I can't hear you. Is that what you want? - No. No. Me neither. So, turn around and go and finish getting ready. Now. Gracias. Eat up. It's good. Here. There you go. Do you smoke? Try it. It'll calm you down. If you like it, we can smoke cigars later. She's the one we're here for. She likes to dance on the veranda. After the evening is over, you're gonna invite her up to your room. Me? She likes handsome young men. I'll do the rest. So, how old are you, Homer? I'm not sure. Twenty-two? - Twenty-five? - I'm not sure. I don't know. Maybe. Have you been to Cuba before? I've never even seen the ocean before. So much you don't know. Water? I'm sorry. Did you invite me up to this room to seduce me? Or do you want to be seduced? Oh! You are trembling. Whoa! Hey, hey. Come... Come, come. What are you doing? Don't worry about that. Shh, you should sleep. And I should go. Yeah. Something happened to you? Yes. A secret? Go. Please go. Please. I'm sorry. Just... They say at the bar that a crazy man was running through the hotel earlier. Maybe they just thought he was crazy. Maybe he was just a prisoner trying to break free. I'm a prisoner, too. Of this island. You taste like cold water. Say it again. Say it again, Homer. What you said. You said I played like... - A maniac. A maniac. - No! - You're a fucking maniac. - Angel! Angel! Yes, yes. Fuck, yes! You're an angel. He's alive. How can Homer do it? - How could he have done that to you? - Relax, man. OA, what happens next? No, no. I would have never given in. He should have kept trying. Try to imagine what it's like to have been a prisoner for all those years. You're not free just because you can see the ocean. Captivity is a mentality. It's a thing you carry with you. Hap succeeded. He broke the rebellion by making Homer complicit in kidnapping Renata. He made us feel we couldn't possibly be angels. We were too human. Fucking liar! I hate you! Scum of the Earth. OA. It isn't Homer that's doing this to us. It's him. You told us. You told us that we're down here to find each other. To find out what we are. Maybe even Renata. You said we needed five. We're five. I was wrong. Look at me. OA, look at me. Fuck me! It's broken? My fucking luck. Listen... if he comes for me... I ain't comin' back. I'm... I'm too sick. Hap, you know I won't survive another round. I ain't no championship quarterback. You'll be fine. No. Don't, don't, don't. Please, just wait. I can tell you things. I've got information. Look, uh, my fingers go in here? See? I ain't struggling. All right, it's your choice. What's that? What is that? It's gel. It makes the collar slide nicely over your head. Keeps your hair in place. - Uh... - All right. Head down. Lower. What information, Scott? You know they're trying to escape? Homer and Prairie. They're, uh... they're practicing these... these movements. All night long, while you're asleep. Yeah, they were. She says it's gonna open up a... - ...a celestial door. - Mmm-hmm. A portal that they can... that they can escape through. She thinks they're angels. Is that right? Lean your head back. Chin down. Keep still. Stop talking. There we go. Look, I... I gave you good information, right? I was thinking maybe you... you skip the experiment and, uh, and send me back to my cell. Well... it is good information, Scott, but most important thing we do here is the work. Collect the data. We're gonna change the world. And that's it. You... you think you know everything. Some fucking doctor you are. Did you know she can see? Since her last NDE. Since you whacked her in the head. She's been playin' you for a fool. You broke their rebellion. You did. You broke him, and you broke her, too. You showed her that he ain't nothin' but an animal. No, I changed my mind. I want the gas! I want the gas! You know, just because she doesn't love him doesn't mean she's ever gonna love a monster like you. You know what she calls you? She calls you the "Angel Hunter." Oh! Oh, shit. Aah... You lied to me. You did this. ♪ Nothing you say ♪ ♪ Will ever be wrong ♪ ♪ 'Cause it just feels good Being in your arms ♪ ♪ And I'm running with you ♪ ♪ As fast as I can ♪ ♪ Singing to myself I want to hold your hand ♪ ♪ And we're going downtown ♪ ♪ 'Cause we feel like ♪ ♪ Running around ♪ ♪ Is it really this fun ♪ ♪ When you're on my mind ♪ ♪ Is it really this cool to be ♪ ♪ In your life ♪ You were right.
