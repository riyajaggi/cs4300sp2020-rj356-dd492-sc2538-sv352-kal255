For some, they come in with the tide. For others, they sail forever on the horizon. Never out of sight, never landing until the watcher turns his eyes away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by time. That is the life of men. Now, women... forget everything they don't wanna remember and remember everything they don't wanna forget. The dream is the truth. Then they act and do things accordingly." That is the opening paragraph to my favorite novel of all time. Hold up, I said "my," not anyone else's. Their Eyes Were Watching God, by the saint, Zora Neale Hurston. Why is that? Do yourself a flavor and read it. You will thank me. If I'm lyin', I'm flyin'. And Nola Darling hasn't spread wings... yet. ♪ Sunshine ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ Ah.

Oh, God. I love you. I love you. Mm, I love you. Nola Darling... You have just been Opal Gilstrapped. Room service. Do not disturb. Oh, sorry. We'll just leave this here in the hallway. What does your daughter think about you guys in public? I mean, not the making out, but, like, holding hands in the street? Um... Our daughter Skylar loves it. Our daughter? Um... I mean, she's definitely curious about it. She's way too grown for her age, but I kinda feel like she could flip at any minute and just be over it. No fucking way! Ladies, me and Sky are thick as thieves, okay? We're like sisters, it's great. How are the two of you like sisters when you and I are trying to raise her as a... I'm gonna have to remember that move. What's the story, Morning Glory? After My Name Isn't, I feel inspired to increase my use of video and photography as a part of my artistic game. So that's what we're calling it now. I don't wanna just do one thing well, okay? I don't wanna just be known as a painter. I wanna be multi-disciplinary. Like who? Magic and MJ. Scorsese. Prince. Angelou. Simone. Sinatra. Carrie Mae Weems. Alexandria Smith. Do you need more names? Do you know who they are? I... am a man of the arts and letters, and I will thank you to not forget that. Can we get my camera now? Merci! Can we get some help? Thanks. - How may I help you? - Hey, man. The lady here is looking for a model D-LUX 109 if you have 'em in stock. Yes, we do. - Fantastic. - The lady here definitely has a mouth. Hi. I'm Nola Darling. What's your name? - Gifford. - Nice to meet you, Gifford. Yes, can we take a look at that Leica model D-LUX, please? - Of course. - Thank you. - Does this model take video? - Yes, it does. Amazing. And what is the damage? I'll... take it. Ms. Darling, be right back. - What? - It's definitely my entire rent check. Décisions, décisions... - Decision made. - Yeah? Yeah. Oh! Don't hurt me now. What is that, your shy guy? - I don't know. - He don't know? Thank you. Um... May I... uh, spread it out over three cards? Is that possible? Anything for you, Ms. Darling. I didn't wanna say anything, blow up your spot, but I loved your My Name Isn't manifesto. That was dope. Thank you very much. Do I get a "that was dope" discount? And that's a no. Thank you. All right. Laughing in my face. Cool, cool, cool. Same shit, different day. - Mm-hmm. Could've gone boarding. - Oh, totally. This motherfucker. What's up? Joey Chainz is closed. - Closed? - Yeah, for good. Yeah. As usual, your late ass is late, and for those of us who are on time all the time, when we got here, shit was closed down, locked up. No notice, no nothin'. - Not even a courtesy email. - Nuh-uh. Nada. How can they do some shit like that? Easy. They probably got priced out, raised the rent mad crazy. Where does that leave us? - Ass out. - Unemployed. So, what are we supposed to do? Look for work! Yo, this is some straight up shenanigans. I'm going back to bed, y'all. Fuck this shit. That's some bullshit! Let your sacred water wash over me, cleanse me, nurture me, embrace me. YemayáMi Madre, sustain me. I ask you, Iyáto, fill me with your healing energy and shine your light into me. IyáMi Modupe, allow your presence to be known in this Ilé, your sacred space. O Mio Yemayá. Ase O. - What up, sis? - Hey, what's up? - Huh? - Yeah. Buenos dias to my favorite sister. You only have una sister. The one and only sister. All right. Cut the bullshit. What do you want? - Bullshit or caca? - Both. - Alright. Let's chase to the cut. - Oh, my God, yo. I was born this way. Act like you know. What do you want? Since you put it that way, I gots the good news and I gots the bad news. Which one you want me to hit you with first? The good news. Lulu, I love you. I love you more than any brother could love a sister without it being freaky and shit. I love you so much, it hurts. - It hurts all right. - No, no, no. But do you actually understand the deepness and proximity of my love... Mars, just give me the bad news. I can take it. All right. I woke up this glorious morning feelin' funky, fresh, and fly. I rode my handmade bike built by me to Joey Chainz and guess what? Surprise me. Joey Chainz was closed. Cerrado. - And? - Well, Joey Chainz is closed for good. They lost their lease. Gentrification. The empire strikes again. So, like, what are your plans now? I don't know. I got some serious figuring out to do. But... here's a generous advance. Bong to the motherfuckin' bong. I don't need fucking $50, Mars. I need half the fucking rent. Didn't you hear me? You deaf? Joey Chainz is closed. I have no place of employment. - Get a fucking J-O-B then! - Where? I don't know, man. Hit the fucking pavement. You know what? Because you're my brother and because I love you, - I'm kicking your ass out. - The fuck? - You gotta go. - No. Wait. You're kicking your brother out who you love with the deep deepness - and proximity... - Mars. - ...so much to the curb? - You gotta go! - Go where? - That's between you and your god. Lord willing, this will make you grow the fuck up! You're not a little kid anymore, Mars! Be a fucking man! Grow the fuck up! Goddamn. You know what? Get out! Get out! Get out, go. You gotta go. You gotta go. It's like that? It's like that and a bag of barbecue chips. Hola. I'll be back later to get my shit. Yeah, don't take too fucking long. Jah. Go. Lulu, I'mma remember this! Let me get this straight. Joey Chainz gets shut down, Lulu kicks you out, and now you wanna sleep on my sofa. You right. You right. No. You wrong. You wrong. No. You right. You right. How long would this be? Just until I get settled. Please, baby. Baby, please. Baby. Please, baby, baby, baby, please. Please. Por favor and shit. Okay. Enough already. No shenanigans, a'ight? It's short-term only, one hundred percent platonic. Yeah, hunnid. No rawness, nigga. You didn't know what I was talking about. Oh, no fucking! Why didn't you say so? God give me the strength. Yo, word to mother. Nah, no touchy, no feely. I know you and Opal got your thing going on, so mad respect. Love the one you're with. Thank you. Yo, oh... But here's a little something something with the rent. Nola, take it. It's good money. Boy, you are on the clock and the clock is ticking. Tick-tock. Tick... tock. - Morning, Mr. Jamie Overstreet. - Guess we should keep it formal. You guess right. How you been? Well, Cheryl and I, uh... we're getting a divorce. I failed my family. You could never fail your son. Jamie, I have been talking to a divorce lawyer. As have I. Let's have an amicable divorce. Is that even possible, with us? Yes. But it will be up to you. Me? You and I both know why. You will blame me. Blame me for the break-up of our marriage. I don't blame you, Cheryl. That's what you're saying now, but I know you. You will blame me. You have never blamed yourself for anything since that fateful day we met. You are incapable of being honest. Yes or no? We will have an amicable divorce. My number one concern is for our son, Virgil. You should have thought of that before. Amicable? Mars. What are you doing, ringing my bell? I just took a chance to see if you was home. Okay. And as you can clearly see, I am. Now what? Why you gotta be so hostility to me and shit? I just need a friend to talk to. Oh, we're friends now? Womb to tomb? Not birth to earth. Stop playing. I lost my job. I was wondering when Joey Chainz would finally fire you. Not fired me. Your boy Danton came and shut Joey Chainz down. Henceforth and whatnot, Lulu kicked me out the crib. So, indirectly, directly, you're responsible for me joining the ranks of the unemployed. Me? Yeah, you, Clorinda. You really know how to pick' em. Yeah. You know what? I really do know how to pick 'em. I'm sorry, Mars. What's... What's next? What's your plan? - You're not gonna laugh at me? - I'm not gonna laugh at you. - You promise? - Promise, Mars. - You promise? - I promise. Cross your heart and hope to die, stick a needle in your eye? Oh my God. You are really trying me. Clorinda, cross your heart. - Music. - What about music? About to make my dream a reality. Nothing to it but to do it. Word. Well, thanks for not laughing at my dream. Thanks for sharing it with me. Can I come inside? It was almost, almost a nice moment. ♪ Such pretty hair ♪ ♪ May I kiss you ♪ ♪ May I kiss you there ♪ What? Are you in Pilates? Keep still! I'm sorry! I'm stiff. How much longer is this gonna take? ♪ Beautiful ♪ I saw Mars today. And? And what? What, you two are talking again? His sister Lulu kicked him out. He told me he needs to stay with me until... Until...? Until he gets back on his Jordans. I mean, feet. His feet. Until he gets back on his feet. Well, why didn't you talk to me before you agreed to let him stay with you? I guess I forgot. Yeah. Well, I don't know how I feel about you cohabiting with a former lover. Um... Do you trust me? Look at me. Do you trust me? Yes, I trust you. Then trust I will lay down the law. Just because you lay down the law doesn't mean Mars is going to listen to it. Baby, it's gonna be okay. I can take care of myself. - You think so? Huh? - I know so. Hmm. I guess we'll see about that. ♪ So beautiful ♪ Don't be mad at me. I'm not mad at you. I'm annoyed with you. I'll take annoyed. I'm sure you will take annoyed.
