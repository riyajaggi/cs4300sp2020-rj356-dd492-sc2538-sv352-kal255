 How does it feel knowing your novel, Barracoon, went unpublished for 87 years, collecting dust, only now to see the light of day? I leave these gifts for you. Dear Elizabeth Catlett, thank you for the grant I have received in your name. I pray I've done you no disrespect. Mr. Ralph Ellison. I know I got big heels and shoes to fill. I promise to do the best I can, be the best I can. - Right? It's the grand reveal! - Aha! Bam! Right here in Brooklyn. Look at this. - We transformed this whole thing. - This is amazing!

 I mean, we're going to have artwork here for all the kids in the neighborhood. They're gonna come in here and they're just gonna have an amazing time. - Divine, you did this! - Yeah, "we." You've gotta bring Nairobi. Oh, man, I wish I could. I wish I could. Well, why can't you? 'Cause, man, her mom was... She still won't let me see my daughter. - What? - Yeah, it's been years, you know? Been going like this for a while, and it's like, I don't know what else to do. But I know I ain't gonna give up, you know, because, look, I made a lot of changes, you know? I've got released, I'm doing this program, I'm making some money. I even got my own... I even got my own little studio, you know? So... It's just... It's messed up, because I want to see my daughter. You know? And she just keeps holding on to this old Papo. - You know, the guy pushing the cart. - Right. The guy drinking the bomb. The guy, you know... drinking all that beer and smoking weed, but that's not who I am today. And there's just no way for me to try to break it down to her, let her know, "Listen, I'm doing the best I can," right? Mm-hmm. I mean, I don't get paid a lot, but I'm catching up on my child support. Listen, I guess it's hard for people to trust that, but there's got to be something else you can do. There's gotta be something outside the courts that we can do, right? Absolutely. I mean, I'm trying my best, right? The brothers at the center are all I got, right? They keep telling me to hang in there, you know, continue to, you know, work on my assignments, and Brother Mustafa, who's practiced law, he's given me a lot of insight, right, on how to get things together - and go in there and fight for my rights. - Right. Oh, and truth to be told, she'll reach out. - Yeah, man. - She's getting to that age, you know what I mean? She's getting to that age where she'll want to know the truth for herself. And it won't be enough for her to just continue believing what her mother says about her father. That's wild. We just dropped Mom off at JFK, right? You know she don't stay around long, but it was nice seeing her, right? Like, just as quick as she comes, she leaves. - Always. - Like, damn. Now both our names is on the lease. You know, maybe we can have a serious discussion about... About... ...reconfigurationalism and shit around this crib 'cause... You're bugging. Look, I'm just saying, you got a lot of candles and... - Look, peace and love. - I'm lighting them for you. - But... - I'm lighting them for you. - 'Cause you need all the help you can get. - I might have to hang MJs on this wall - to even it out, get the aura... - No. - ...the energy a little... - You can keep it in your room. But all jokes aside, like... like, when we were in PR, Mom had a serious conversation with me. On the side tip. And... you know, she told me to pull my weight around here, so... for real, like... you ain't got to worry about me. Good. You promise, though? You promise you're gonna get it together? I appreciate that, but you know... - We got to keep this place... - Sis. - Okay. - Cross my heart, hope to die. Stick a needle in my eye. - All right? - All right. - I appreciate that. - The thumbs gotta touch. You're from Brooklyn, you should know the thumbs gotta touch. These storefront rental prices are straight up highway robbery. Yo, whatever, your solo show is gonna find a home, the perfect home, trust. But in the meantime, can we finish planning my Ting & Tingle party? Because I need that shit to be lit. Oh, right! Your DIY Mary Kay affair. Where's it gonna be again? At your barns, nigga. I kid! I kid! I'm fucking with you. Well, I'm dead ass. You said with everything that you love, that you was gonna host my party at your apartment. And word to everything I love... Why you giving me the stiff hand? I am, and it's gonna be amazing. I'm getting everything together. I've got all the hors d'oeuvres. What the fuck? Yo, Nola! What? Broo! Broo! Broo! Brooklyn, we made it! Yo, that shit is yours right there. Yo, why didn't you tell me we were gonna see your art campaign? These motherfuckers. Yo. Nola, calm down. Why are you so upset? 'Cause I think I just got played. Really? And they put my name on this shit? Fuck! Nola. But... Don't take a picture of that shit. I'm sorry. So, Nola, how have you been? Not so good, honestly. Um... I'm here to talk about the campaign. Oh, well, things look great on our end. Everyone in the office is happyand... all the positive mentions on social media are outperforming expectations. Why are the photographs in black and white? Yeah, it's a last-minute change. Couldn't be helped. It couldn't be helped? That's all you got? Why didn't you tell me? I didn't know I needed to. EarWave compensated you for your work, which we love, by the way, which we... still love, and then the design team did what they needed to do to... maximize the campaign's impact. You obviously didn't love it if you changed everything. - Nola, please... - The campaignwas supposed to represent the broad and beautiful spectrum of our people. Okay? My Name Isn't was deliberately in black and white. It represented my trauma. In black and white, our hues are tamed, subdued, muted. Do you understand that? Nola, I am aware of your original intention. And like I said, there were decisions that were made that were beyond my control. I thought you said you were running point on this. I thought I was. But, as it turns out, my position on your campaign was mostly for show. But for what it's worth, I believe in what you did. And if I had the kind of power like I thought that I had, I would have made sure that nothing like this would have happened. Right.

Clo, you're early. - Always. - And you brought champagne? It's Cava, it's from Spain. Same principle, different region. I'm glad you could make it. - Hi, girl. - Hey. Hey, have you been getting my messages? Umm... Yes, I have, and I've been meaning to hit you back, but I've just been crazy busy. Well, first of all, congratulations with Brooklyn Joy. Those ads are so stunning, Nola. Are they? Yes. Why, you don't think so? Eh. It was a paycheck. Okay. What about you? How you doing? I am so sorry to hear about the New Medina. You know what? I'm just happy to hear that you have been busy. Hey, how are the new pieces going with your solo show? They've been great, they've been really great. - Good. - Yeah. Good. I would really love to see some, whenever you're ready. Just so I can have a better sense of what I'm trying to sell. Sell? What do you mean, sell? Well, we're mounting your show, so we want to sell the art. That's kind of the point, right? Oh. I mean, I just thought since the New Medina closed that... I would be out of the game? Girl, I am so not. Got anything good? Oh. - What's that? - You're carrying groceries. I was wondering, did you get anything good? You know, just some snacks for the party that Nola's having. So you were invited? Uh-huh. That's great. That's really, really great. Okay. Hi. I'm coming back bigger than ever and your show is a huge part of that. You know what? Let's table this. I promised Mekka that today would be all about her soirée. Okay. - I wanna... - Well, you know where to find me. Hi. Hi, Miss Ella. Hey! - Hi. - Hi. - Hi! - Hi! Thank you. - Hi. - Come here and give me a hug. It's good to see you. - I was almost late... - You look beautiful. - Thank you! - Hi. Clorinda. Nice to meet you. It's knowledge, wisdom, and understanding. Culture, power, and refinement. Papo! Hi! My name is Divine. Papo? No more. I like Divine. Have a seat. You remember Mr. Jiggles? Yeah, how could I forget Mr. Jiggles? Bianca. You look a little under the weather. More or less. You all right? I haven't seen you in a while. Haven't even heard your music. I've been real busy. So what's up? What's going on? Is everything okay? I ain't complaining. Thank you so much, everybody, for coming out. You're welcome! And thank you, bestie, for hosting. I got you, Boo. Ting & Tingle. Mm-hmm. This is my granny Edwina's all natural hair recipe. Her spirit and her strength inspired me to create something that empowers women, makes us feel really good about ourselves. - Pass it around. - Okay. Oh. So cute. You think I can use it on the rest of my body? - Yes. - I got eczema. Versatility in a jar. All natural, non-toxic. Really great for the skin and for the scalp and... What's that? That tingle? That's your edges making a comeback. That growth? That's your ponytail saying "I'm finally ready for that bobo." What's a bobo? - It's elastic with two balls on the end. - Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, ladies, if your ting is ready to tingle with me... ...come on, open it up. Open it up. Oh. This smells really good. Oh, lavender, tea tree oils, Jamaican caster oil... - A few of my special ingredients. - Damn. Looks like someone's on the come-up, girl! First the bastion of activism and now Ting & Tingle. It's... very entrepreneurial. Mm-hmm. - All right, ladies, I'm taking pre-orders. - Yes. So, tell your friends to get with my friends so we can all be friends. - Okay? - Allright. - Raqueletta Moss here. I'll take two. - Aww. Raqueletta Moss. - Yep. - It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Don't say it if you don't mean it. I do mean it, you're buying two bottles. Yeah. - When you were gone... - Locked up. I found that G spray-painted onto my stoop again. Really? I'm sorry for what happened to you, Divine. How you got arrested, I didn't mean for it to happen. I thought they would give you a warning, at most. I thought the cops would ask you to leave. You know, I bought this brownstone with money from my divorce. It's been acrimonious. I'm sorry to hear that. Would you care for a drink? Divine does not drink. Can't lie, though. Papo did. Nobody likes me in Fort Greene. Not you, not Rachel, not Nola. Please, don't go. I got work to do. As you can see, I work for the Parks Department. Part of a program for vets that I found out about while I was inside. That's good. A silver lining. I suppose. Divine. Of all the stoops in Brooklyn that you could sit down on repeatedly, why mine? It was my stoop first. First. I grew up in this brownstone. BG. Before gentrification. I'll see you around, Bianca. Later, Mr. Jiggles. My loving bed rules represented who I was then at that particular phase in my life. But you've grown. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. I've grown. I'm grown now. You're on a journey of your own choosing. Yeah, but like, Nola, who's doing you? You know. Who is it? Well... Right now, I'm doing my damn self. Whoa. It's good, though. No, thanks. I don't share with strangers. You sure? 'Cause the way you look, look like you can use a little relaxing. I'm sorry, who are you exactly? Mekka's second cousin. Removed. Twice. From where? From the group home, right, baby? Big Mo from the group home! - Was she really in a group home? - Yeah. Brooklyn Joy is so freaking good. Snap. You did that? Girl, you're famous. - Like, it's epic, Nola. - Yeah. I told her that, but she don't like it. - What? - Okay, first of all, they plagiarized My Name Isn't. And it just... it didn't fulfill my vision. It didn't say anything that I wanted to say in the world. Like nothing, none of it. But you still got paid, right? The first of the month is coming up. Yes, I got paid and your rent will be on time. I'm sure Jameelah had every intention to execute your vision. It's just, sometimes things happen, you know? You hop into the driver's seat with this master plan, and then all of a sudden, the wheels just pop off and you're just free-falling. I feel that. But after Puerto Rico, it just became really important that my voice is clear. And to be really intentional about the art that I'm putting out into the world. Well, I for one am so excited about your show. You have to send out invites. I know. You gotta let us know when and where it's gonna go down. I mean, it'll be on the Gram, so... you get an invite. You get an invite. You get an invite. Yo, did you get a call back from that place that we went to go look at? Uh... No, I'm still waiting to hear back from them. You scouted out spaces without me? Me and Shemekka checked out a few places, yeah. Were you going to let me know? What's she gotta tell you for? You ain't her mother. Because, Shemekka, Nola and I had an agreement that we would mount the show together. Was before I informed her that earWave was going to offer her the campaign. Isn't that right, Nola? Intense. Okay, can we not do this in the middle of Shemekka's soirée? Hold up. The two of you been needing to squash this for a minute now. - So... - Mekka. Real shit. Come on. Let's get to it. The fuck is this? Celebrity Deathmatch? Okay, well... So what? You happy now? Not really, because you don't respect me much. Me? You're the one being mad disrespectful. Admit it, Clo. You can't stand it that Shemekka is moving forward while your ship is stalling a little bit. All I said was that Shemekka was on the come-up. It was a fact, a true statement. It's not what you said, it's how you said it. It's always how you say it. - It's your tone. - Come on. She's not wrong. Clorinda definitely has like this tone. I noticed that. I'm sorry. You know what? I'm not going to stand here and apologize for having higher standards for myself. If that comes off as sounding judgmental at times, it's because I hold my friends to those high standards too. That's bullshit. You're a hater. You hate on me. You hate on Shemekka. - What? - You hate on anybody. You hate on anybody who's moving forward when you're not in the best place. And I get it. Your heart is broken. Danton really fucked up, but that doesn't mean you can't be happy for other people. Wow. You know what's so funny? Is that I am the only one that can see your real potential. I'm the only one that is willing to groom you to become this successful and powerful artist. Groom me? Do you think I need you, Clo? Because I do not need you to make art that impacts people. No, but you definitely need me so that anybody will see it. And you need me so that anybody will give you the recognition and the coin that you deserve. Okay, enough. I can't do this anymore. Friendship or business. - We need to choose. We can't do both. - That's ridiculous. Please, we've always done both. You just need to stick to the plan for once. And I'm telling you that I can't. Not anymore. Nola... there are galleries on standby, downtown curators, and I don't mean in Brooklyn, that are waiting to see what I can bring to the table. And there's a plethora of young, untapped, ready and willing artists waiting for you to represent them, Clo. But I only have one artist. I really need to help with this show. This is the only thing I have right now. Clo, I'm sorry, but if we want to save this friendship, I cannot be in business with you right now. Not for this show and not for the foreseeable future. Oh, wow. Okay. Boundaries be like that sometime, you know? Hard to put up, but necessary in the long run. Clo. - Don't say I never gave you nothing. - Thanks. This is hard for me too, you know. You're one of my besties. Just stop, okay, with the whole nice girl act. It's not a fucking act and you would know that if things weren't so fucking weird between us. Thank you. - And you're right. - It's been weird. Super weird. - I know. - Really fucking weird. - Like, why? - I don't know. Will we ever be all right? We have to be. You're one of my favorite people in the whole wide universe. - That doesn't even make any sense. - Yes, it does, it's science. We're going to be okay, Clo. That's the best party I've been to in like... forever. Coming from a group home, I guess so. Papi? Nairobi? Nai-Nai? Hey, Papi. Oh, my God. Look at you. It's you. Wow. - You're so grown. - I'm 21. You don't even know my age? Come on, let's sit down and talk. I don't know if you remember, you must have been like... six or seven years old. Yeah, sit down. I came by the house. How did you know I was here? - I asked around about you. - You asked around about me? I wanted to come pick you up and take you to the park. And... things just went sour right away. And, uh... argument... began and... I will never forget the look in your eyes as your mother called me a bum. I remember that. You remember that? Yeah. I want you to know that your Papi... Your Papi's not a bum. - Okay? - Yeah. I'm not a bum. I used to do things and I don't do those things anymore. I have a clean slate, I'm a righteous brother. That was the past. Now I'm living in the light. Yeah. And I'm on the straight and narrow. And I want you to know that I'm here for you. You can always come to me, you know? Whatever you need, any kind of conversations, any questions, I'm here for you. - Okay. - I'm here. Honest, open-minded, and willing. 'Cause I want my daughter in my life. I want my Papi in my life. - I love you. - I love you too. Thank you for looking for me. Okay. Nola! Nola! Nola! Nola! Put it on. Put it on. Just shake it. Just shake it, baby. Just shake it. Yeah? Shaboo! Shaboo! Shaboo! Shaboo! Shaboo! Shaboo! Shaboo! Shaboo! Are you ready? Yes! Shaboo! Shaboo! Whoa. Whoa. Ride it! Ride it! Ride it! Yeah! Ooh, ooh! Looks like you had quite a gathering. It was for Shemekka's new hair care line, remember? Oh. So that girl is finally honoring her natural hair? Shade. Shade. Shade. Shady McGrady. The product's really good. I'm proud of her for launching it. Okay. Okay. And what about you? I haven't seen you since you got back from Puerto Rico. Look at you, girl. You're glowing. - Am I? - Yes. Good trip? Uh... No words. The strength on that island... the resilience, the self-determination... Mm-hmm. Subjugated people find their ways to rise up. That's how we do. Yes. It was inspiring to say the least. Definitely helped me gain some clarity into my art and what I need to sustain it, you know? Yeah, that's it. That's what I'm talking about. You know, now is the time to just focus on yourself, you know. Find out what's important to you. While you're not tied down to any one person, or two, or three, whatever, how many people you got. I still cannot believe you are starring in a play. It's wild. It's like... this part of you that existed before I was even born has been resurrected. That's how it feels. Like I'm back. How's Daddy doing with it? Does it matter? I should hope so. Okay, you're right. Stokes is feeling a little butt-hurt because I'm not around as much as he's used to, but you know, I'm all right with it. So you really can have it all? Yes, you can. Just not at the same time. Not all at once. I'm very proud of us. - Me too. - Give me a hug, girl. That's my girl. Aww. That's my baby. That's my ladybug.
