 FILM 9 No child has ever died from a mother’s embrace. We agreed we’d tolerate him as long as the negative effects are balanced out by any good he brings. Now the scales have tipped. From the beginning, we knew this wasn’t forever and that there won’t be a pension for his years of service. But why have you decided it’s time? I’m his friend, as strange as that sounds. I want him out before it’s too late for him and us. He’s out of control.

 Does your daughter think so too? Yes. Okay, I’ll think about it. When he flies off the handle, can you imagine what’ll happen? Are you prepared to risk it? Did you like it? What? You know what I’m talking about. Are you asking if I’m a sadist? Just be honest… if you’re not afraid. Deep down inside, yes, I liked it. It scares me. Why? After all, isn’t it…

 terrible? Are you asking me? How was it? It was like I’d been electrified. It was like sex, but better. You poor thing. What kind of men have you run into? Do you feel it? I love you. A question about authority. How did Meglin act toward his superiors? I mean his character, his behavior. What did he think of us, the higher-ups? Do you really believe that you’re superior to him? MOSCOW She was strangled. No signs of sexual assault. She was six, coming home from school. Excuse me, dear. I’ve been looking at this for 18 years. And you aren’t weary of it? The Chinese are great, aren’t they? They make everything-- clothes, cars, computers. One of my friends gave his son a Chinese robot. It runs, jumps, and does push-ups. We need to tell the Chinese that Russians need a robot that can do two things: listen and drink. What do you see? The ring is in her hand, not on her finger. He gave it to her. Is that how he lured her in? Keep going. No signs of struggle. Her clothes aren’t torn. She came here with him herself. She didn’t resist. Why? Does she know him? Let’s go. Find out if the lock was broken or opened with a key in the previous murder. POLICE -Long life to you! -May I… -What’s your name? -Gena. Go on, Gena, rack your troubled mind. Two girls were found dead in a basement. The locks to the basements aren’t damaged. They were opened with a key. Only the locksmith has a key. That means you. -Are you a pedophile? -What are you talking about? You think I touched a kid? -I was born and raised on these streets. -Born and raised. What else? Tell us how you lured the girls to the basement. With rings! -What’s with you, pal? -Who’s your pal here? What’s a roofie doing in your bag? Roofies. I get it. You need money, and you’re too lazy to get laid. What’d you do-- put them in a first-grader’s ice cream? My mother is sick and can’t walk. The doctor wrote her a prescription. I have it! -I’ll show you! -Okay, we’ll verify that. Gen, do you drink? Yeah, your mother can’t walk. Anyone would drink. I drink. It doesn’t matter if you know. There you go. That’s a dialogue. So you drink till you pass out? Don’t be shy. It takes one to know one. By day, you get an eyeful. Comes the evening, you throw some coal in the furnace and you wake up like last night never existed. It happens like that, right? Maybe you got drunk that morning and don’t remember what you did to the girls. -If that’s true, then fucking kill me! -Yeah. Then who’s going to sit with your mother, me? Who’d you give the keys to when you were drunk? Think. I didn’t give them to anyone. They’re at my house. Who’d you take home? No one. I live with Mama in a one-bedroom. It’s not me, I’m telling you. I’ll swear on anything! Understood. Gennady doesn’t remember anything. Vodka has a lot of pluses, but there’s one negative. You don’t remember, Gena! Although, in a way, that’s also a plus. Yes. He can’t talk. He’s busy. One second. They have a suspected serial killing. They’re asking for a consultation. Shoot me the address. What do you have here? The investigator left. He had to wash his car. He’ll be here soon. Where did he go? Well, he didn’t expect you to be so fast. CIRCUS -She was a magician’s assistant. -My colleague. She lived alone, no relatives. She’d been here a couple of days. Then the neighbor boy called the police. He bought groceries for her. We have a witness. -Probably expensive. -A rare type of cockatoo. Really? It’s all clear. She was murdered because of the bird. The thief offed grandma and then washed her for unknown reasons. Correct? Do you know why they hang the cage below eye level? Why? If you put it above, they’ll be scornful. -And if it’s below? -They’ll be scared. Are you scared of me? Or scornful? Getting a parrot to say its first word is the hardest part. Then it’s-- easier. Like with people in interrogations. It can’t be! -It was you who called us? -Well, yeah. It’s the second one already. Elderly women with no signs of violence. Both were by themselves, so I made the connection. What did you do? I tied them into a serial killing. Zhenya, my classmate. Major Meglin Rodion. Hello. Nice to meet you. I’ve heard a lot about you. It’s a huge honor. What’s with grandma-- taking a swim? You know, I applied to train with you, but Esenya beat me out. What did you tie together there, Zhen? Mittens? Well, Evgeny, shall we test you? What do you see? Yes, it was a competition. But how else would you want it? Life is a battle. Well… -Well, what? -Well… Like I told you. It’s the second one-- an elderly woman in a bathtub. They were bathing, fell asleep doing old-people things and drowned. I’m not asking you what you think. I’m asking you what you see. Tell me. I won’t discuss the pose. She wouldn’t have lain down like that. It’s uncomfortable. And the slippers and the robe… There are no robe or slippers here. Exactly. How did she get here? She didn’t come here. She was brought here. Oh! I’ve raised my replacement. In good spirit, the seasoned veteran passes the torch. Everything’s much simpler. It’s cold. She wasn’t bathing. Who’s the notice on the door for? It’s for you. “Sorry, the hot water will be cut off for a week.” So that’s to say I’m right. If they were drowned, it means it’s a serial killing. -Of course it’s a serial, Evgeny. -And the saucers by the bed. And the saucers. Registration. Registration. That means the doctor visited her the day she died. There’s a plate for the ampoules. Find him and talk to him. Maybe he remembers something. And find out if the same doctor visited the first old woman. I need information on the first case. -Ho! What, are you giving me orders? -Yes. How sexy. Do it right now. -I hear you, boss. -Get to work. Comrade Major! Do you need a second trainee? Or a first. I’d love to, but she says she won’t share me with anyone. She’s possessive. -Yeah, she’s like that. -Like what? Sergeant, can I take the witness? -Why? -Why? To interrogate him. You want to take him? Who else will take care of the orphan? Here you go, my pretty. Are you sure? He isn’t a cactus. You have to feed him. That means I’ll give him to someone… who’s trustworthy. Here, sunshine. Yes. I understand. -They got Egorova sobered up. -And who’s that? The girl’s mother. I don’t understand. I told the police everything! Why are you questioning me? What kind of girl was she? An ordinary, good girl. I don’t understand. What’s it matter? What do you need? Ordinary, huh? She wasn’t different… in any way? There wasn’t anything special about her? She was a normal child. She was a good student. I didn’t even help her. Well, she had some health problems. Who doesn’t have health problems? What was wrong with her? She had-- She had psychological issues. She’d get up at night and walk around with her eyes open. She broke the lock. I found her out on the street once. The doctor said it’s sleepwalking. She’ll outgrow it. He prescribed some pills. At school, they teased her, called her stupid. At the playground too. But she didn’t pay any attention to them. She’d sit there, reading in a corner, oblivious. -What time did she get home from school? -What? What time did your daughter come home? It’s a simple question. -She came home after classes! -At what time? Do you have other children? Nastya was my only child. Thank God! -Is that her drawing? -Yes, hers! I’m taking it. Let’s go. -How much are the rings? -100 rubles. -For one? -No, for the whole thing. There are five. The Chinese are great. -Do you have 100 rubles? -Get ready. -Come on, one more time. -No. So, what now? Sit for now. Observe. WATCH REPAIR - CLOSED We’re not working, only returning. We aren’t accepting repairs. Wait. Where’s the owner? What’s going on? We agreed to meet. He won’t pick up the phone. The owner went missing. -How’d he go missing? -He didn’t make it home. He won’t answer the phone. We already told the police. Now pick someone. Who? Someone to give the ring to. -How should I choose? -How does he choose? Like a hunter. Look for a victim. That girl there by the swing. Why? Because all the children are in groups, but she’s like a castaway, alone, without a friend. You asked how not to be a victim. Stay in a pack. He kills them by day. They went to the basement without making a racket. -They believe in him. -Do they know him? -More likely, he knows them. -What do you mean? Hi! -Did you lose your ring? -Where? It was hidden there behind your ear. -Thank you. -You’re welcome. -Do you want one for your mama? -Yes. -Where do you live, in Number 9? -In Number 14. -Close by. What’s your name? -Lera. Lera. Valeria. Lera, have you really not been taught that you shouldn’t talk to strangers? -You learned that, didn’t you? -Yes! So you’re not listening when they try to teach you something, huh? -What? -Why are you watching us? -Is that your child? -It’s our child. Identify yourself. Have you been sitting here long? After the first girl, we sat here for two months. -Now it’s happened again. -Understood. Take the child home, okay? I’m at my post. You’re not at your post today. He’s not coming. If something happens, blame me. Here’s a ring for you, Valeria. And remember what I told you. This guy will take you home. Understand? Go home. Stop! What about the houses around the park? Quickly. Across the road, there are residences, a trail, garages, and a health clinic. A health clinic. Thank you. A health clinic. You said he knows them but they don’t know him. He’s not dumb enough to take a risk with acquaintances. Does he follow them, dig up information on them? It’s easier than that. “Nastenka, you’re bothered by nightmares. Vasily Ivanich told me all about you.” Or “Lenochka, do you sleepwalk? Do they call you stupid? They’re the stupid ones. You’re my smart girl.” Do you want some coffee? It doesn’t work. “My smart girl, come with me. I’ll help you.” Something like that. -Is it possible he’s a doctor? -Why wouldn’t he be? Look how convenient it is to go to the park from the clinic during lunch. Sandwich, yogurt. Sitting and watching plainclothes men searching for him. Beautiful. Thus the long break between the first and second murders. Not just that. He can show restraint. He doesn’t give in. He’s patient. He’s patient, and then he attacks. What’s with the coffee machine? He didn’t want to kill the girls. He just stored them away. Because they weren’t the one he’s looking for. -Where are you going? -See you tomorrow! POLICE I checked. No doctor officially visited the victims. This is interesting. Pictures of the first victim’s apartment-- Grafko’s. Do you see the bedside table? I see. A saucer. I verified that both Grafko and Borisyuk had been checked in at Municipal Clinic 3. Is that the one near the park? Give it here. When were the pictures taken? On the ninth. I’m taking them for now. What did you see in them? Comrade Major, will you tell me something? Hi. Select something. No thanks. Excuse us. Go ahead and tell me your news. I… don’t want to make any accusations, but, in my opinion, it’s really strange that he went missing exactly the day after he agreed to work on the sketch of the guy who visited Prazdnichny. That is, you want to say… he killed him? Well, that’s what I assume. Clearly. If this watchmaker isn’t found, then that’s it-- our last lead is a dead end. No, Esen. Well… These so-called cold cases-- it’s just a matter of lack of time or skill or manpower. Well, laziness. Understand? Criminal investigation is a science. If you’re good at it, there won’t’ be any unsolved crimes. Sasha, why are you trying to convince me? I’m a legal professional, after all. He’s here. He exists. We know that now. He’s starting to panic. If he’s panicking, then I’ll find him. Who will you find, Sash? Anya’s real killer. What a good, sweet person you are. What do you think? What do you think? I’ll give you a minute. The photos were made on the ninth, so Grafko was killed on the sixth. Within about a month… Borisyuk was killed, also on the sixth. -The breaks between the murders-- -Which murders? -What do you mean which murders? -Which murders? The first girl was killed on the seventh, and Nastya Egorova was also killed on the seventh. -Think. -Why are you talking about the girls? Wait. In the same district, on the next day… In the same district, on the next day after the murder. Right? Wait, you mean to say… I mean to say he’s killing little girls the day after he kills the old women. It’s one and the same person. Where are you going, huh? So, guys, come on. So, well… There are no signs of a break-in. And no signs of a struggle or a robbery. You were called here for nothing. She probably drowned because she wasn’t careful. Postcards from three years ago. She had no one. -She was afraid to die alone. -She was afraid for no reason. In what way? What? -The old lady couldn’t move around well. -Sit. What’s that? Yeah, some insignificant information. Basically, a neighbor said that she couldn’t walk on her own. -A social worker helped her. -Did you establish time of death? Yes. The experts say around yesterday. “Around yesterday” or yesterday? -Yesterday, yes. -Yesterday? That means a girl’s going to be killed today. The lock isn’t broken. If she couldn’t walk, how could she open the door? Good question. That’s delicious tea, Gen. -All in all, you got lucky with your son. -Yes. After all, I’m raising this ungrateful youth now. We raise them, go without sleep, get them on their feet. But what’ll happen to us? Who’ll bring us… a glass of water? Who knows? So, tell me… when your son had a day off, when he went camping with his friends, were you scared? What do you think, son? I had such cramping, I thought, “That’s it.” I don’t want to call him. -He doesn’t have a life because of me. -Calm down. And then I was thinking, as soon as he comes, this will have passed. But I called Emergency, of course, just in case. I gave the doctor 100 rubles. It’s not a lot, of course. After all, you can’t not give anything. He’s just a poor fellow. Yes, the little Hippocratic Oath. But he gave me a shot. It relaxed me, and I even fell asleep, thank God. But I told Gena. How he scolded me for not calling him. It turns out you’re a good man. Forgive me for not seeing that immediately. Well, really… It’s your job. Mom, they’re searching for a killer. Oh, Lord. My dear, what, you couldn’t find yourself another job? She wanted to be closer to me. Love, you know, is a vice. That’s the truth. What was the doctor’s name? Do you remember his last name? I have a bad memory. I’ve already forgotten both your names. But here, he left me a prescription. There you go. The receipt. Here you go. Gen. Are these your keys to the basements. Half are for the apartments, half are for the basements. No, don’t think that. They left them with me. Many of them are alone, sick, elderly. Anything can happen. Do they always hang here? Of course. Uh-huh. Grach. V.S. GRACH MUNICIPAL CLINICAL HOSPITAL And when he goes on leave, all the grannies cry. No way. He’s attentive and doesn’t sit around even for a minute. His heart is in this. It’s not for the money. He makes time for the grannies and he paints, yeah? -How’d you know? -Right there. His signature. It’s the same as on the prescription. GRACH Well, yeah. How could we get in touch with this miracle doctor? We have one sick granny here who said, “I only want him to treat me.” Unfortunately today won’t work. It’s his day off. He works one day, then has three days off. Miss, how can we find out his home address? One minute. I’ll look. -Kargusheva, Number 9. -Yes. -It’s close by. -Five, seven minutes away. -Do you live far from here? -Well, relatively. -Yes. -A girl went missing. Thanks. POLICE AMBULANCE I hate you! What could happen to her? I hate you. I’ll kill you! She dressed her daughter, went downstairs and left her by the entrance. Then she went for her son. He’s two years old. She went up to the second floor. She was gone for a minute. She came back downstairs. Her daughter was gone. She went to the house, and she wasn’t there. They searched the basements of the houses nearby, and nothing. I gave an order and I’m thinking, “God forbid they find”-- They won’t find a body. -Why not? -Because. Get away from her! Get away! Was there anything special about your daughter? I don’t understand. What was wrong with her? She was feebleminded. She was slow. She’s five years old and can’t talk. Almost. Almost. He won’t kill her. You hear me? He won’t kill her. -Why would-- -He won’t kill her! She hasn’t done anything wrong. She’s exactly who he’s been searching for for so long. He found her. She put on the ring. Let’s go. Where did he come from? Let’s go. Take a little walk. -Listen-- -When I was young, I loved to swing. I was preparing to be an astronaut. I underestimated my own strength and pushed off on this stupid thing. It gave me such a whack on the back of my head. It was painful. That didn’t teach you anything? It’s like this, Rodion. You find him, and that’s it. Your mission ends with that. Or? Or you’ll get hit over the head. APARTMENT OF V. GRACH He doesn’t live here anymore. Why are you shaking so much? Have you recovered? Is this Vasya? He wasn’t like that when he was born. He was barely over four pounds. We couldn’t bathe him. His skin would turn dark in the water. Then he got better. He was two years old. He started waking up at night. He’d walk around the apartment. The doctors said he was a sleepwalker. We had a record player in the room. I taught him how to put on records. He’d awaken and get up while we slept. Then it’d be… Magomaev. “Wedding, Wedding.” It’s a wedding, wedding, wedding Singing and dancing And wings carried the wedding far away Ulya couldn’t stand it. She jumped out of bed and started beating him about the head… with a slipper. She was screaming, “It’d be better if you were never born!” How much can you yell? -How much can you yell? -What are you doing? I hate you! The wedding was huge Places were scarce And heaven and earth Were scarcely large enough… And after that, his eyesight. They prescribed glasses. Then, so he wouldn’t wake her at night, I started using an alarm. I put it in the kitchen myself. At a quarter to 3:00, I’d get up… and wait for him to wake up. A trio marched past me Vibrant and colorful And the breath of spring came from them And I walked around completely alone And wished that I was the groom We walked around until he came out of it. Then Ulya and I divorced. She left, and he stayed with my mom. Mama would draw him a bubble bath. He’d sit there for hours. After that, he slept well. The bath was his favorite place. Then he started going to kindergarten till he moved back in with me. Why’d he move back if everything was so great there? So… It’s a stupid story. There a was a little girl at the kindergarten. She somehow climbed into his bed during quiet time. She said, “Let’s sleep like Mama and Papa.” They hugged… and fell asleep. They were just kids. The parents of the girl found out and caused a big stink. But my mother… she’s old school. She said, “I’ll cut your wee-wee off for this disgrace.” Well, Vaska ran away. He came here to me. He was only six, after all. He didn’t have any ill will for Mother. He looked after her till she died. And how did she die? Yeah. She drowned in the tub-- her heart. Three years ago. Vaska would still see me. Then I got sick. I’d say… “Heal me. You’re a doctor.” He was sitting at the table there. He drank a glass of vodka… and fell over… and left. Now he only calls me on my birthday. And that’s it. I was with him… every night. Where does he live now? At Mother’s. She signed over the apartment to him. What do you have there? The door is Chinese. We can take it down in a second. Only he has one of our kids in there. Get out of here. What if he panics and does something to her? He won’t do anything. He’s lived his whole life in a state of panic. He’s used to it. -Why are you standing around? Get out. -Where? Get the fuck out of here, quickly. If I wasn’t on the job, I’d-- There’s a psycho behind that door with a little girl and nothing to lose. Are you prepared to accept that guilt? -No. -I am. -Go on, leave. Go. -Downstairs! SPECIAL FORCES It seems I gave you the right address. You didn’t go quite far enough. Move out. Put away your gun. Put your gun away. Everyone’s gone, Vasily. Are we going to talk through the door? Come on. Did you think of the Thorazine in college? Smart. Then you perfected it on granny. Get out of here. I’m not judging you. What am I, a judge or something? But then everyday life started, yeah? You went on calls with a medical bag. You saw them and thought, “What saintly creatures these grannies are.” They’re saints, but devil knows how they manage. Basically, it’s not a life but torture. You freed them from their suffering as much as you could, yeah? “Do you want a shot, Granny?” “Oh, my dear, give me a shot, lest the pain torture me. Thank you. May God keep you well.” “Now, Granny, we’re moving on… to an aquatic procedure.” Well, who’d bury them there? Drowned and drowned. Heart, blood pressure-- whatever fits. Grandmother died, and now you can think about yourself. Did you start dreaming about her-- that girl from your childhood? You thought, “If only I could find her. I’d give everything in the world to find her.” You even drove to the playground. Time after time. I know. Only you didn’t find her. You started looking on the streets. And I can’t forgive you for that, Vasya. You’re a doctor, Vas. You understand what hurts. You started injecting Thorazine. It helped for a while, right? Then you thought, “Why is it that I’m sick? It’s everyone else who’s sick.” I understand, Vas. I’ve had these thoughts myself, but not about children! They haven’t had a chance to-- And you killed them in the basement. You can’t do that. Do you understand? I can’t forgive you, but I can promise, if you release her, I’ll help you. Remember how it was when you were a child? A bubble bath. Everything was ahead of you. Everything was ahead of you. But this is a Wedding, wedding, wedding Singing and dancing And wings carried the wedding far away The wedding was huge Places were scarce And heaven and earth Were scarcely large enough The wedding was huge Places were scarce And heaven and earth Were scarcely large enough The wedding was huge Places were scarce And heaven and earth were scarcely Large enough Let’s clear this up. Meglin intended to kill Grach, thus violating all instructions in our protocol, and presented that to the psycho as an act of kindness? Correct. And you justify that? I’ll rephrase my question. You would’ve done the same? Yes, of course. SERPUKHOV -Here. Let me help you. -Oh, hi. Thank you. Thank you. Help! Help! People!
