 Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK FILM 1 You say, “For as long as I’ve been conscious.” But this is not true. Rather, you should say, “For as long as I have been unconscious.” I promised you. Do you feel it? I love you. So, Esenya Andreyevna, shall we begin? -I’m ready. Where do I start? -With a blank page. Why did you become a detective? This seems like an odd choice-- For someone with your looks.

 Looks can be deceiving. Still, what was it? MOSCOW / 1999 When I was seven years old, my mother was murdered. They never found the killer. I grew up, and I swore… that I would find him. MOSCOW / 2015 FAREWELL, GRADUATES! Dear graduates! You are now degreed legal professionals! And with some final words of wisdom, Ministry of Justice Senior Counselor Andrei Sergeyevich Steklov! Hello! Let’s set aside rank for a minute.

 You know that today my daughter is also setting out on her own journey. Good luck, Esenya. And good luck to you all. I don’t know what’s in store for you. Life has many different paths. I don’t even know where she’s going, even though I see her more than you. But just remember this. If you can’t summon up the courage to take an important step, or, on the contrary, you’re being pushed to take a reckless misstep, you can turn to me. I’ll hear out each one of you with as much care as I would her. Perhaps even with more care, because sometimes she talks a lot. So I’ll do whatever I can for you. We’re colleagues now. Congratulations! Go celebrate! I hate you. What a pleasant surprise. -I wanted to do something nice. -And prove that you’re in control? I’m not going to St. Petersburg to work for the prosecutor. May I ask why? Because I’m sick of only being known as your daughter. You don’t like being my daughter? I do, at home. But at work, I want people to know me for who I am. What is it? Your mom wanted a son. That’s why you’re so headstrong. What’s wrong with St. Petersburg? Remember, you used to say, “A prosecutor works with shadows. A detective works with those who cast them.” I don’t want to work with shadows. I don’t want to just sit on my butt. I want to find out who killed Mom. So that’s what it’s all about. You promised, remember? Have you found him? -He’s been dead for a long time. -How do you know? Did you see the body? Do you know his name? -You just gave up. -That’s enough. Call them. Tel them thank you, but no thanks. Esenya Andreyevna, when was the first time you met Meglin? GRADUATES! Senya! Let’s go dance! Sasha, I didn’t know you dance. I’m not bad. -Have you been drinking? -Just a little. -And I haven’t. Would you get me a drink? -No problem. Just don’t move, okay? -I’m not moving. -Wait here. Esenya! -Hey! -Hey! -How are you? -Good. And you? Not so good. I’m bored. Come on! Look at all the girls in their dresses! And panties. -And you? -Me what? -Are you wearing panties? -Zhenya! I’ll leave you two alone. May I borrow your mascara? I don’t think I have much of a neck. It’s nothing like yours. At least there’s no need to worry about jewelry. -That’s what you worry about? -I worry about a lot of things. I envy people. Anulya, have you ever seen my elephant ears? No, really. I’ve always envied you. I’ve envied your neck and your legs. And the jewelry. -Aren’t you forgetting something? -I’m serious. And your clothing is always so… eye-catching, but it’s obviously expensive. You have both taste and means. I’ve never had that. But I’m young! I’ll make money. -I’m a legal professional now, right? -Of course. And your neck is gorgeous. And no one in our class has eyes like yours. And jewelry is a dangerous thing. Men use it to buy us. -Have you ever had any offers? -To monetize myself? A couple of times. I want all the dirty details! He gave me a necklace. And then he said, “Let’s go to Seychelles.” And you? And I said, “I’m not going with you because you’re a loser.” Girls! Zhenya is just amazing! -Liz, are you wearing panties? -Are you? I am. Does a new life really begin tomorrow? -What is it gonna be like? -Full. But what it’s gonna be full of-- not a damn clue. Gross. What’s on your mind? -What’s it to you? -What do you mean? Who knows when we’ll see each other again! How about some wine! I’m wondering what’s next. There’s nothing to think about. It’s all written out. Where? On everyone’s forehead. What do you see on mine? -Bad handwriting. -Come on, it’s right there! It clearly says “I will sting.” Sting what-- human hearts with verbs? No! Verbs describe actions. To work, to plow, to sweat. That’s not cool. Interjections-- they’re cool. I get it. What do you see on my forehead? You’ll get married. It won’t work out. You’ll have willpower. He won’t. You’ll get a divorce. You’ll get married again. You’ll get a divorce again. Same story. You’ll quit this marrying hobby. You’ll find solace in work. You’ll become a lawyer in Yaroslavl. You’ll be making good money. You’ll buy a pair of earrings. That’s it! Move over! Give me some water! Come on! Get him! Vitalya, come on! Come on, Vitalya, come on! Come on! God knows what you’ll think of me, but, oh, well. For once, I should’ve done what they do in movies. I should have thrown this out in the trash. I just can’t. Are you talking to me? Living crystals. Every one of them is different. Gold, platinum. It’s beautiful. It’s German. When Germans do something, they do it right. I wanted to give it to her today and fly out together tomorrow. To Germany. Then she says, “Thank you, Yuri Sergeyevich. But I can’t accept this. Please don’t.” At first I thought she was being shy. Her family isn’t rich. She’s just not used to this. That wasn’t it. She met someone else. Tall, young, handsome. I got upset at first. Then I thought, “Why should I ruin the night for someone-- for someone I feel this way about.” How is she to blame? She only told me how she felt. I’m just a fool with a necklace. So I just came out here to get some air. I’ve been here for about 40 minutes. I open the box, look at the necklace, and I can’t throw it away. How can anyone throw away something so beautiful? You know what? I don’t need anything from you, not even your name. Please, take this. No! No! If you don’t like it, throw it away. I can’t do it. Please take it. It’s from the heart. Please. It’s heavy. Living crystals. Stay put. I haven’t given the order. I can’t see him. I want you. What are you doing? I can’t do it like this. What? Do you… need to get ready or something? Something like that. Are you, you know… “You know” what? Are you a woman yet? So what if I’m not? Does the constitution say that we all have to fuck? You’re right. -Me neither. -Not a woman? I’ve been with women. I have. Sanya, you haven’t been with me. Honestly, I don’t think you ever will. I don’t get it. Don’t you like me? -I do. -So what’s the problem? You’re too… good. I don’t even know if I deserve you. You do, you do! Esenya, of course you do. You do. -Let’s go to work! -Copy that! Are you done? Let’s go! POLICE Did you show them? You did it. Did you show them? You showed them, didn’t you? -I showed them! -Well done. She goes like this, and you go like that, right? Yes! She goes like this, and I go like that! Well done! So, you showed them, right? -I showed them! -You did great. -You’re just tired, right? -Yes. -Are you tired? -I’m tired. It’s okay. We’ll talk, and then you’ll go to jail. Okay? It’s okay. Stop crying. Tell me, those deadly earrings this weekend, and the necklace-- -did you make them all yourself? -By myself. Good job. You’ve done such a good job. Tell me, and this guy, what’s he like? What guy? The one who told you what to say, what to say to the girls. He did such a good job. You both did. He’s done a good job, and so have you. What’s he like? He’s handsome. You’re handsome too. You are. What’s his name? “You won’t catch me.” He said that was his name. “You won’t catch me.” He said you’d be asking. Yep, that’s his name. That’s a good name. It’s unique. Listen, can you do me a favor? I just can’t get around to it. You seem to be good with your hands. Will you help? -No problem. -I’ll come visit you in jail. -Sounds good? -Deal. -Take him. -No problem. -Coming through! -Coming through! “You won’t catch me.” Keep your hands off me! Keep your hands off me! What’s wrong with you? Anya was just murdered, and you-- Screw you! How noble! You’re going to nobly cover your ass your whole life! -I said keep your hands off! -Calm down. You wanna lose your stars? Friggin’ legal professionals! Future fat asses of Russia! You’ll be pushing paper your entire lives! What are you gonna be pushing around-- whatever your daddy-general lets you? I’d rather be shoveling shit than prosecutor’s papers! I’ll be like Meglin! He cracked him in just two minutes! All it took was psychology! You’d be looking for him for five years, you morons! Listen. My house is empty. Everyone’s out of town. Get away from me! If you want, we can go to my place. -Help yourself. -I’m fine, thank you. You’re welcome. Anyone would have done the same. If you don’t want it, all the better. Or worse. I’m a horrible person. Why? I agree. I’m just curious why. I was having a good time, and I forgot. About Anulya. We were friends for four years. Then some scum killed her, and I’m here enjoying myself. It’s not like you killed her. Besides, justice has been served. Hurrah. -He got him fast. -Who’s “he?” Meglin. I could have learned more from him than I did at that freaking university. Here you go. Are you sure he’s the one who tracked him down? Yes, my dad told me. This was the third murder at a graduation. Cases that-- that make others pee their pants are something only Meglin can handle. Is he an expert on maniacs? An expert-- Half the country are experts, but there’s only one Meglin. What’s so special about him? His clearance rate is 80%. No one knows how he finds them. On paper, he’s just an ordinary major. In reality… he couldn’t care less about the cops or the FSB. He kicks open generals’ doors with his boot. Are you talking about your father? And yours. My dad says that he doesn’t report to anyone. He has a personnel file, but it’s empty. No résumé, no pictures, no biography-- not a damn thing. So how do I find Meglin? You can’t. He just shows up wherever he wants… and suddenly a maniac floats up to the surface. Does he kill them? Well, almost. He catches them… like butterflies with a net. He’s got some kind of method. I ask my dad, “What’s his method?” No one knows… the method. Anulya never liked you. She’d say, on the outside, you’re okay. But on the inside… you’re empty. Not much to the outside either. What do you think? I don’t think about you, Zhenya. Do you have a pencil? -I almost hesitate to ask what for? -To hold my hair up. Ask Iosif Vissarionovich. Where are you off to? I’m gonna go. We’re done, right? I get it. To see your melancholy knight. Sasha’s good. And he has a soul. And I don’t have one? You have a penis instead of a soul, Zhenya. Bye. Cheers, Iosif Vissarionovich. TWO DAYS LATER Oh, God! My beautiful girl! My baby girl! My poor girl! You left us too soon! No! No! No! How could this happen? No! No! …HORRIFIC MURDERS… OF YOUNG BOYS… FSB ARCHIVES -Hi, Esenya. -Hello. I heard about your graduation party. I’m speechless. -I can’t even get my head around this. -Everyone’s shocked. You and Anya were friends. Her parents must be devastated. I can’t even imagine. The funeral was yesterday. Well, life goes on. Stay strong. -What do you need? -Case files. Here’s the list. Those were… Major Meglin’s cases. I’m actually writing a paper on his method. Those files are sealed. -Does your father know? -Of course he does. He said to sign them out under his name. I’m not making copies. I’ll just read them. Hi. -Why are you here? -Why are you? I’m actually applying to graduate school. -You too? -No! I mean yes. This is my classmate. He’s also applying to graduate school. Sorry, Esenya. The files have been checked out. -What do you mean? Who has them? -I can’t tell you that. Okay then. -Good-bye, Elena Vasilievna. -Good-bye. -Esenya, do you want to-- -Bye, Sasha. …do something tonight? Hello. -Hi, Dad. -Hi. What are you doing? -Not much yet. -I see. I have a favor to ask. Don’t check out sealed files from the archives under my name. Is that clear? Elena Vasilievna ratted me out. Well done. -Why do you need Meglin’s case files? -I just need them. I see. I’m going to repeat the question. Why? I want to work for him. -Out of the question. -Why? -I have a meeting. We’ll talk at home. -I can’t. I also have a meeting. Bye. Ivan Mikhalich, greetings. Thank you for your prayers. Listen, about Esenya-- I’m very grateful to you, but it’s not going to work out. No, she does want to. It’s just… The St. Petersburg weather affects her badly. She’s allergic to everything. Listen, can we figure something out later? INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE Andrei Sergeyevich, we’re waiting for Dolgov from the DA’s office and… the other one. They’re almost here. We’ll start soon. Good. Excuse me. I see your meeting is in full swing. We agreed to decide everything at home. I’ve already decided. I want to train under Meglin. What do you know about him? I know he’s the best. Have you ever thought that if there’s so little that’s known about a person, it’s for a reason? He picked out Anya’s killer in five minutes. I want to work with him, and you know why. I said we were done talking about it. What if he’s alive? What if he’s still out there. Doesn’t that bother you? -You can’t live for revenge. -This isn’t revenge. This is justice. Listen to me for once. He’s never had anyone train under him, especially a brat fresh out of college. He turned away detectives who had worked dozens of cases. Meglin works alone. Period. You don’t want to go to St. Petersburg? Fine. You want to get dirty? No problem! There’s a spot in Homicide in Novosibirsk. A detective trainee. Siberia. A real job. The flight is tomorrow. Think about it. I actually do have a meeting right now. Andrei Sergeyevich, Meglin’s here. Hello. I’m Esenya Steklova. I just graduated from law school, with honors. Will you take me as a trainee? A trainee? Yes. Okay. Can I get your phone number so I can call-- I don’t have a phone. -Andrei Sergeyevich, everyone’s here. -All right. Just like that? And you weren’t surprised? You know that he had reasons of his own. I know it now. I was too overwhelmed to think about it. He could help me. He was… a legend. Did you show them? You did it. Did you show them? You showed them, didn’t you? I showed them! -He got him fast. -Who’s “he?” Meglin. Meglin works alone. Period. Will you take me as a trainee? Okay. Can I get your phone number so I can call-- I don’t have a phone. LIPETSK Help! Help! Oh, my God! Stop!
