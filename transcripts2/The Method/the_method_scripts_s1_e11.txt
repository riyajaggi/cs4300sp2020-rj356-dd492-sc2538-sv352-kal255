 FILM 11 Killing is like giving birth to a child. I am the father and the mother. I open the door to another world. I give new life. ZASLAVSK / SCHOOL No. 23 You’re late. The bell’s already rung. -The guitar is heavy. It slowed me up. -Do you play that? Of course. They asked me to play for Teachers’ Day. -We have a rehearsal today. -Then hurry up, artist. PHYSICS

 E equals mc… squared. On top of being a lazy student, now you can’t even wake up on time? I’m sorry. Aren’t you in the wrong place, my friend? This is a physics class, mind you. Music is on the third floor. POLICE -Get us away from here! Please! -Save me! Help! -My daughter’s there! Do you understand? -Calm down. We’re working on it. Hurry up, come on!

 -Let us through. -No cameras allowed. Make way! Drop your weapon! Hands behind your head! I will only speak to Major Meglin. Do you feel it? I love you. Esenya Andreyevna… so far, we have only discussed, let’s call them, Meglin’s successes-- the cases he solved, the criminals he caught. But sometimes, the killers managed to escape Meglin. Let’s talk about his failures. I don’t say Meglin is perfect, but he never failed and he always saw his cases through. Fine. Then let’s say he was… a bit slow to respond. What do you mean? Would you call Meglin a gambler? Are you serious? Do you really think he could play with them? Well, we want to figure that out. One more thing. The guy was in touch with all sorts of marginals on the Web. Do you remember the Saturday killer? Our guy was one of his subscribers. I haven’t seen the whole exchange yet, but the guy seems to have been completely brainwashed. He was among those who left comments about the Saturday killer’s manifesto. Like, “It’s cool.” Then some troll egged him on. “I bet you can’t beat this.” And all hell broke loose. Thanks, bye. His name is Nikita. He’d been seen by a psychologist. His father was a hunter and had a rifle. His parents were found in their apartment. Nikita shot them that morning. A special forces team is on site now. Then he went to school. He shot down a teacher and five schoolmates. The kids said he had issues with the physics teacher. He was likely to get a poor grade for the term. He signed Yashik’s manifesto. The Sabbatarian? Yes. They met on the Web. Before he left, he poured acid all over his tablet. Glukhoi located it using his IP. Has he been interrogated? He refused to talk to the investigator. He said he’d only speak to you. POLICE Hello. I was afraid you wouldn’t come. What made you think it was me you needed? You’re Meglin. He described you to me. Go for a walk. Who is he? Are you prepared to listen? Let’s have it. Meglin… you think you can do everything, but you can’t do a thing. You think everything is under your control… but it’s me who’s in control. Instead of looking inside yourself, you’ve played the wrong card over and over again. You’ve betrayed yourself. I want to show you how pathetic and helpless the world you created is. What is this order of yours worth? Tomorrow, I’ll strike closer to you, and you’ll be helpless. You won’t be able to stop me. You won’t… catch me. Terrifying. What was it you fell for? -Strange. -What’s strange? He said you were smarter, that you understood. Understood what? Us! It was he who opened my eyes. -I lived in fear my whole life-- -Come on, take him away! …and he helped me conquer it. We live in a false, messed-up world whose laws I reject. I had to do this to make a statement, to declare that I exist! I fear no one! He taught me that! Not to fear, but to be feared! And I fear no one! Did you get it? You won’t… catch me. Do you think his threat is real? I think it’s… fucking real. He said closer to you. What did he mean? Not literally closer. Closer… meaning more painful. MILITIA As I understand it, he saw him stab his father and mother to death. -But… -But what? When we arrived, the boy was sitting by his mother’s body with a knife in his hands. This one. -Did he see the murderer? -It’s Kotov. Neighbors saw him leaving. I see. Have some water. What’s your name? Rodion. Rodion. What can I say? A terrible thing happened to you. I’m sorry for your dad and mom. But they’re gone. Tell me what happened. I was hiding under the bed with the knife. My dad gave it to me. That bastard found me and dragged me out. Mom was still alive. He said, “Kill her, or I kill you.” I-- I-- I-- I was scared! I was scared! She asked me herself! Rodion. Rodion, calm down. Your mom wanted to save your life. You’ll help us… find him. Sometimes, you have to-- have to surrender now in order to triumph later. I’m proud of you. You’re brave and strong. And you’re alive. That’s all your parents wanted. Understand that, Rodion. That’s him. Rodion, we’ll find him. They’ll execute him. No. I want him to suffer. I want him to die slowly. I want to kill him myself! MOSCOW / INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE An anonymous source at the Ministry says an accomplice of the criminal is at large, which means that today’s incident-- -He’s busy! -I know. …could be the start of a whole series of similar crimes. Law enforcement agencies could not comment on, confirm or refute this information, but we know that all schools in the city have stepped up security measures. Where did they get that from? They pay well. A nice side income for some of our officers. I think it’s no secret to you that not many higher-ups share the idea that the end justifies the means. Another shooting like that and they’ll bury you. Then I’m lucky that it won’t happen. -How can you be so damn sure? -He’s playing a game. He won’t repeat his moves. He always tries something new. Is that your point? Should I pass it along? We took steps on our end. We stepped up security at schools, sent out extra police patrols. We’ve mobilized everyone we could. Any ideas how to catch him? I have ideas, but they get in the way. Specifics. Keep your riddles to yourself. People’s lives are at stake. “At stake.” Are you a gambler too? We believe that the schools are safe. He knows about the security measures. He won’t risk it. Report everything concerning this case to me immediately. What are you going to do? -I’m going home. -I mean regarding the case! -I don’t know. We need to wait. -For what? How long? Well, until tomorrow, until he shows himself again. You mean until he kills? Are you insane? I don’t know. Ask Bergich. Rodion, stop it! What are going to do? He put this in motion weeks ago. He holds the trump card. I have nothing to play with. Let him play his cards, and we’ll see. Great. Here he is! Hey. -Hey. -Hi. It’s hard to believe, but I’m not drinking today. Hard indeed. How come? I have to be at work at 7:00 tomorrow. They cracked the whip after the shooting. We’re going on patrol like ordinary cops. Zhenya, are you sure this the place to talk about that? The whole department’s been turned inside out. It’s all over the news. What, can’t we discuss it together? That’s the same man who killed Anya, right? Not the same. Prazdnichny killed her, while this one is, I don’t know… -An instigator, I’d say. -An instigator. Shrewd fellow this instigator. Pour me some. -Are you sure? -Yeah. Listen… is it true that he leaves messages for Meglin? Yes. Well, so… can we have a look at them? -No. -Why not? They’re part of the investigation. I have something to do with this investigation as well. I could have a look, make a suggestion. Guys, you don’t understand. We are up against a very interesting personality. What are you laughing about? What’s so funny? I don’t understand. For starters, he’s a brilliant psychologist. He can plant his ideas into people’s heads. Right. So what? He uses words as a weapon. That means anything he says has an underlying message. Something like… a code or something? Plainly speaking, yes, a code. Sorry, I’m dumb. But handsome. Esenya, Sasha’s right. I never agree with him, but this time he’s right. This guy killed Anya, you see? We need to pursue every possibility. All the more so since you don’t know what to do. -What makes you think that? -Why else would you be sitting here? Meglin… you think you can do everything, but you can’t do a thing. You think everything is under your control… but it’s me who’s in control. Instead of looking inside yourself, you’ve played the wrong card over and over again. You’ve betrayed yourself. I want to show you how pathetic and helpless the world you created is. What is this order of yours worth? Tomorrow, I will strike closer to you, and you’ll be helpless. You won’t be able to stop me. You won’t… catch me. Bring him in. What’s this? You didn’t even let him wash himself! Take the handcuffs off him. You can go. Come on. Here. Sit. How did you recognize him? After so many years. I just sensed him. Why didn’t you tell us? You promised once to find and execute him, remember? He didn’t even bother to hide. On the contrary, he became a well-known man. The local cops were eating out of his hands. Don’t look at me like that. I did your job. Why did you kill the other two? How were they to blame? Don’t defend them. They were criminals. That’s why you stabbed each of them 20 times? You think you can do whatever you want? -He killed my parents! -That’s not an excuse for killing. Now you’re just like him. He won. Don’t you see it? No, he didn’t. He’s dead now. Tell me honestly. When you killed them… what did you feel? I felt relieved. It was a weight on me all those years, and now I’ve freed myself. I’m done. Take him away. Rod. Don’t’ be afraid. They don’t come during the day, see? They’ll come at night so they can have a drink right after. Get it? It’s hard for them to kill. For you and me, it’s easy. Shut up! Scared, huh? Scared! Safiulin Rinat Ibragimovich! Article 105, Part 2-- death penalty! Meglin Rodion Nikolayevich! Article 105, Part 2-- death penalty! Take this one away. Where? No! No! I want to live! I don’t want to die! I don’t want to die! No! No! Sit down, Rodion. You’re quick on the uptake, so I’ll be brief. You have two options. Either they take you away like him… Or? Or you try to wash away your guilt. How? By working for us. In what capacity? You got yourself dirty. Happy birthday, Rodion. You were officially executed by firing squad this morning. So it’s safe to say that you were born again. Once more. Go, go! Cheer up! You’ll take your physical training course here. …two, three! We live in hard times. All sorts of filth are crawling out of the woodwork. But we’re helpless in many cases. Our hands are tied by the law. We have to choose sometimes-- law or justice. And that’s where you fit in. Look. Alexey Anofriev. Our pride. You can take him for a model. I’ll try. ANOTHER GRADUATION PARTY MURDER THE MURDERER IS CAUGHT YOU WON’T CATCH ME SASHA Yes. Go ahead. Listen to Sasha. I made a linguistic analysis. -What did you make? -Rodion. Go on. People can leave traces by their deeds, words, even by their mere presence. Get to the point. I analyzed his every word-- idioms and style of speech-- and put together a preliminary profile. This man is obsessed with power. He’s obsessed with power so much that he challenges himself. He doesn’t kill just for the sake of killing. He wants to be a step ahead of his most gifted pursuer. I believe his deliberate emphasizing of his superiority is his way to compensate for some suppressed-- Sasha! My dear! You think I didn’t know this? I give you high marks for effort. Well done. -Have you informed his relatives? -He had no relatives. He lived alone. Do you know him? Look. Go. One, two, three, four. Do the same in turn. Good. Switch. Come on, come on! Come on! What are you doing? What happened? Hello, Rodion. As I see, you worked up some muscle. Now it’s time to learn how to keep it under control. Get in the car. Yes? Already at the scene? Put Meglin on the phone. It’s him. I’m listening. You haven’t even tried to do something, Meglin. I expected more from you. I’m sorry to disappoint you. Do you see the whole picture now? Not really. Clarify. What about some intrigue? You know what, let’s turn it up. A man with your mind will easily calculate the next target based on my actions. So I’ll make the next strike, say, in three hours. Your move, Meglin. Who is he? My supervisor. My old supervisor. I think I understand what he wants to say. Nikita killed his classroom teacher. Grigoriev was your supervisor. -He kills-- -Superiors, right? A logical trap. What do you mean? He’s working me, don’t you see? -How? -Like with everyone else. He’s trying to win me over. You’re not to blame, Meglin. They made you what you are. Look, Nikita wasn’t the killer. It was me. He wants to be friends. Hello, Rodion. Bergich Vadim Mikhailovich. We’ll work together. You… are not an ordinary person. I think you know this. -You want to say I’m mental. -Yes. The traumatic events in your childhood altered your psyche. It started to function differently. What does that mean? You see… the human brain is like… a house… with thousands of doors. If one door closes, the draft can push open another door. By hiding from the horror and guilt after the death of your parents, you shut all the doors to emotion. An instinct, a feeling woke up inside of you. You started to exhibit a pathology. I’ll teach you how to deal with it. Take your time. Look closely at them. Try not to think. Thoughts can be disruptive. Try… just to see. What do you see? -That guy over there. -What about him? A chameleon. Hating you while smiling to your face. If he had his way, he’d kill everyone. That’s true. Believe me, he’ll never leave this place. What else? The old man. Are you sure? He’s one of us. What did you say? Our kind. Will I be like this forever? Well, more or less. You won’t be able to establish contact with ordinary people, but you’ll always sense our kind. At times, you’ll be desperate to become like them. There are many ways of suppression-- drugs, alcohol. But don’t go too deeply into them. There may be no way out. Your training is over. You won’t be going back to the base. Look closely at this and memorize it. This is a serial rapist, a pedophile. We arrested him, but we had to let him go. We only had circumstantial evidence-- nothing to present in court. But we know for sure it’s him. Find him and keep an eye on him. We need to know your opinion. What if it’s really him? Here. Take it. The best weapon is one you can depend on. See you. When Grigoriev left, who became your supervisor? He’s the next victim. Nonsense. He won’t dare. Himself-- not likely. Using someone else-- absolutely. Grigoriev was killed by an ex-military man. Who knows? Maybe he has you in his sights right now. You need to hide, just for a while. No. What for? How much time do we have? Two hours. Go see Bergich in the meantime. Why? Search for crazy veterans in the archive. I got it. -You want to send me away. -I don’t care what you got! -On your feet and get out of here! -You have no right to do this! You-- -You both have no right to do this. -We do! I haven’t taken a walk in ages. -One moment, miss. He’s busy. -I need to see him. It’s urgent. SECURITY They had to die! -Everybody had to die! -Quiet! What’s he doing here? He’s being examined. Lena, show her to the archive. Shall we continue? Tell me… are you afraid of death? We don’t have the death penalty. That’s not what I mean. In general. Accidental death. It would be for the best if all people disappeared. Including me. Killing was the only way for me to find my true self. I’d rather be my true self in here than live out there. My whole life, I’ve pretended to be normal. But I’m not normal. I don’t want to be normal. And to what extent do you think this decision is your own… and to what extent were you, let’s say… pushed? He didn’t push me. He just taught me how. I wandered in the darkness, and he gave me light. I’m turning into the person I’m meant to be. -But you haven’t yet. -Soon! RUBEL In 30 minutes. The rowing canal embankment. They’re coming. I’m sorry for the old man. -When was the last time you saw him? -About five years ago. It’s a pity. He taught me a lot. How much time is left? Don’t take too long. The three hours have passed. It’s over. Meglin! On your knees! Hands behind your head! Are you prepared to listen? Put it down. You think you’re well off? You live while your brothers are dying. You’re a lion serving jackals. It’s not your fault. You were taught that way-- to live by their rules. It’s their fault. They turned you into their tame animal. I will give you freedom, and I will put them to death. Who’s he talking about, Rodion? Welcome to my world, a world without rules. About teachers. So… You didn’t teach me anything. Then it’s-- It’s Bergich! -What? -Call Esenya! Yes, Dad. Esenya, stop! Don’t. Rubel left the gun for him a month ago when he stayed here himself. He planned everything beforehand. Okay then, see you. It’s him. Put him on speaker. UNKNOWN NUMBER You don’t think it’s over, do you? This was the first round. I’ll beat you. I’ll make you become who you really are. You must understand-- either we’re allies, or I’ll destroy you. Every person is a cowardly killer. Brave ones, like us, are the few. You and I have more in common than you have with them. Life is chaos, Meglin. It doesn’t give protection or love. -It’s the opium of the people. -Shut him off. -Off? -Fucking shut him off! I want to show people a life-- That’s what I was talking about. Why didn’t you try to identify him immediately? Why didn’t you start looking for him? Because at that moment, he didn’t know how to look. VLADIMIR
