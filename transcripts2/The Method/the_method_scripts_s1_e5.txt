 Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK FILM 5 Your home is your fortress. But why do you need a fortress? Who is attacking you? Have you gone crazy? I forbade you from taking the weapon. How’d you open the safe? I used the year you were born. How touching. So sexy. Only you have this habit of sleeping with the balcony open. They’ll rob you after all. Yeah?

 Maybe you should lock her in the safe? Go to sleep. We’ll talk in the morning! Do you feel it? I love you. Tell me, did you have sex? -What? -Did you sleep with him? It’s not the first time I’ve heard that. It’s none of your business. I hope you don’t think I’m asking just out of curiosity. It’s important for me to know how close you were emotionally. I’m telling you. We… Thanks. I understand everything. Let’s get back to the case. The athlete? TROITSK She was shot with the pillow.

 The father was simply shot in the head. You know, you were called out here for nothing. We’ve already caught him. -The killer? -It’s their son. This is already the fifth murder. The handwriting is the same. He entered through the balcony door. Lots of people are keeping them open at night. It’s stuffy. He killed the parents, left the kids alive. There was a trophy near the bodies. In each apartment, there were shelves full of trophies. The kids played sports. He knew them. He’s also an athlete. He knew where they lived. -He also knew the parents, naturally. -Why’d he kill them? His father found a new wife. He and the stepmother didn’t get along. I think he hated adults. He’s proving that he’s stronger. The trophy represents his victory. So, the Rubik’s Cube is solved. What do you have here? Will you tell us when you take the bodies? It stinks in here, and it’s stuffy. Uh-huh. And what’s that there? It’s a fire alarm. Now every home has them. It’s the law. It’s the son, I’m telling you. Why come through the balcony if there’s a door? So, that’s the thing. It’s… It’s special. From the street, you can see someone climbing the wall. It’s clear he’s a thief. Who’d think of him? -Only someone who’s not normal. -So you’re normal. Are you mocking me? I have all the evidence against him. He was a professional gymnast. He climbs like a monkey. His father is a veteran. There’s a pistol in the house. They’re zombies in front of the TV. Kids don’t know what to do with themselves. And he found himself a toy. A pistol? Where’s the pistol? Pistol-- Step aside. The boy says that it’s here. I don’t think it’s here. The guys are coming to open it now. We’ll see. Understood. No big deal. -Are you planning a vacation? -What? To Turkey? You should. It’s “all inclusive” there. I just thought, you solved a serial killing. It would be good to give a vacation to a man who deserves it. Did the boy confess? Of course not. He says he slept with headphones on, didn’t hear a thing. Are you going to talk? You aren’t going to say anything? Do you really not understand what will happen to you? -Stand up. -Get out of here. So, are you messing with us? Why are you silent? Say it. “I’m messing with you.” -Now there’s something to deny? -I didn’t kill them. Leave. Go on. Go on. And close the door. Did you take the gun. Tell the truth. -I took it. -Why? To show my friends, and a girl. Just so. That’s what guns are made for. Did the girl give it up? She gave it up. Is that your mom? Sorry for asking, but when did she die? Three years ago. Cancer. And your dad found someone else for himself. He betrayed your mother. Betrayal is a normal human trait. It’s necessary to counterbalance willpower and ambition somehow. You didn’t try to forgive your dad? -You decided to kill him. -I didn’t kill him! Why not? Didn’t have the guts? You didn’t have the guts. Why are you standing? Sit down. Sit. Tell someone else about the girls, all right? You walked circles around this safe when he brought her here. Correct? First he tried your mother’s birthday for the code. And then it hit you. He used your stepmother’s birthday. Correct? When he met her, she was probably all he could think of. You took the gun, walked around the apartment. Did you aim it? Rehearsing? A good musician, after all, rehearses. Then he plays. Plays, indeed… just as the music is written. -When did your father notice? -Yesterday. He changed the pass code before he died. How old are you? Seventeen. One-nine-nine-eight. The year you were born. If it works, will you forgive your father? Let’s go. Come on. The gun is in its place. Take him away. Let’s go. If he grabbed onto the cornice, that means he’s taller than me. That means he’s an adult. Thank you. Height isn’t always a sign of age. -If I see anything, I’ll let you know. -All right. We checked the security camera. Nothing there. You go on. I’ll catch up. Suit yourself. What do you see? I already showed them. Do you want to look again? No magazines or newspapers. You aren’t bored? No magazines or newspapers? It’s boring, but I’m on the job. Why are you sweating so much? It’s hot. How many cameras are in the building? -Well, in each-- -There’s one at each entrance. -There’s two outside. Six in total. -How many wires? About 50. Did you install the fire alarms in the apartments, Valery Vasilevich? Me. The tenants weren’t happy. Our Valery Vasilevich has nimble fingers and protects us from thieves and installs cameras and knows about firefighting. And all that for one salary. They don’t understand, the fools, that not everything is measured by money. Valera, do you work for curiosity’s sake? There are stories in those apartments better than in any German porn. I don’t know what you’re talking about. Well, you’ll have a lot of time to think. Get the handcuffs. There’s no need for handcuffs. I only watched them myself. I didn’t show anyone. -I’ll delete everything. -No, Valer, let’s not do that. Let’s do this. You took it secretly, but now share it with friends. It turns out you get to see it, but no one else does. Show us. Show you what? The really interesting stuff. And you too? Nice to meet you. I’ll show you now. So… There you go. Wow! Mother dear! -Is there more? -There is. One more. There you go. Valera, you have quite the collection. Is there a camera in Room 38? There’s a lively couple, recently married. Show us around 2:00 in the morning. Probably the same-- rolling in the hay. So, 38… Second day, eighth month… So… And… two, zero-zero. And there goes the gunman. What will happen to me now? I don’t know. There’s our main suspect. IGOR IVANOV OUR CHAMPIONS Igor trained here. But he isn’t the killer. Do you think the real killer trains here too? -What’s the trainer’s name? Vladimir… -Akopovich. That’s who you should’ve trained under. And what do you want. The great achievements of sports come from hard work. Pain and humiliation. Go on. Holy moly, you’re turning on the waterworks again here? In 30 years, I’ve never seen a sniveler like you. Vladimir Akopovich. Go on, work! I’m listening. Work, I said. Investigative Committee. What’s the occasion? Tell us, please, about your star student. His father was outstanding. But Igor, not so much. What do you mean? Girls, why are you standing around? Go on, work. Igor couldn’t have stayed here if it wasn’t for his father. He’d be after him with a stick to get him to practice. Igor cried, but he came. Because he knew his father wouldn’t abandon him. Why are you standing around? You can stand around at home. Go on, work. I said work. Then he bulked up his muscles. There went his wins. His father was outstanding. Can you really take a person and make a champion out of him, even against his will? Will? What kind of will do they have? They’re children. They only have computers on their mind. Their heads are full of the Internet and games. And gymnastics is 90 percent work. And the other 10 percent is humiliation? Behind each of these prizes, above all… there’s blood, sweat, and tears. Whose? I’m sorry. Good-bye. MOSCOW INTERNAL AFFAIRS / AUGUST 14 Just as in the previous murders, the killer used a Luger P. 08, made in 1900. Stop. The pistol was more than 100 years old? The Wehrmacht used them in World War II. Is that so? He used a cartridge for a 9x19 Parabellum. It only fits this model. What about that thing I asked for? We checked all registered Lugers in museums and private collections. They’re all there. Not one was used. So the gun isn’t registered. It was bought on the black market. Big deal. Yeah? Why are you acting like the second file doesn’t interest you? Are you training your willpower? Go on, read it. I’ll wait. BALLISTICS REPORT …MAKAROV PISTOL… …VERA STEKLOVA… …SERVICE WEAPON… A service weapon killed my mother? Registered to… …REGISTERED TO OGNARYOV… -Who is Maksim Ognaryov? -Why don’t you love your father? -I love my father. -Because he isn’t dead? You thought he should be since your mother’s gone. It turned out it’s possible to live on, to eat breakfast, dinner, lunch. To smile. -You can’t forgive him. -You’re wrong. -I don’t want to talk about that now. -I’m just being honest. -Do you like me? -What? No! When you’re lying, you always go-- Pay attention. -Hello, Andrei Sergeyevich -Greetings. What are you doing here? I’m happy to see you too. The department heads meet here. Is that okay with you? How are you? We’re fine, but the criminals are becoming petty. -Is the trainee coping? -She learns quick. -What are you studying? -A report on a new case. These black marketers have some nerve. They’re selling guns left and right. They have no respect for the past. I understand. You want to catch up. I’ll be in touch, Andrei Sergeyevich. You don’t have a phone. -You wanted out. What changed? -Everything. How long do you plan to train under him? -Until he runs me off. -That means not long. Does the name Maksim Ognaryov mean anything to you? Maksim Ognaryov. No. Who’s that? Never mind. Today, I’ll be off earlier. I can make dinner. I’ll be late. It’s been 40 days since Anulya’s death. And I’ll find Ognaryov. My dear ones, thank you for coming, for not forgetting Anulechka. She came to see me early this morning. She said, “I can’t-- I can’t rest, Mama.” I asked her, “How come, Anulechka?” You don’t have to, Nin. “I prepared your bed myself. It’s soft. Is something stopping you?” And she said… “Mama, I can’t sleep while he roams this earth.” Hush, hush. It’s over. Mom, don’t cry. Don’t cry. He’ll be punished, right? Right. What was that just now? -Nothing. -Don’t make a fool out of me. You want to say that someone else offed Anka? I don’t understand. Esen, is that true? Damn, you can’t go anywhere without him. I’m not supposed to talk about this… in theory. Prazdnichny was a puppet… a tool. Someone else is behind this. Someone else? But who? Nobody knows. Not even your Meglin? Your amazing Meglin. Guys, I already told you a lot. So good-bye. Esen, wait. Sash, what else? I want to talk, and you’re always disappearing. Talk. You don’t have to speak to me that way. -What do you mean “that way”? -Yeah-- Condescendingly. Can you take me seriously? -Seriously? -Yes. Okay. Sash. You’re a very good, proper, smart, and boring guy. That’s why I’ll never be with you. Straightforward. -I’ll get him myself. -Who? The guy who killed Anya. The standard is in your hands. And in yours. Can I stay the night here? Yet you say you don’t like me. What happened? I don’t want to go home. He’s lying again. You all right with me coming here? He has a limp. Even so, he climbs like a monkey. A former athlete with an injury? Totally possible. -Yes? -Glukhoi, listen, be a pal. We had a gun show up on a case. It’s really ancient-- a Luger from World War II. The boss says it could’ve been bought on the black market. Will you do some digging for us? Thank you. All right, bye. BUY A LUGER Why does he kill these people? Does he have some connection to them? I not only have the right to work… but I also to have some rest… in my own home. Do you call this place home? Apartments, of course, are for amateurs, but you invited yourself in. And after Mom died, I hated our home. For me, it simply became… a house. So I think to myself, “I’m going to the house.” Of course, out loud, I say “I’m going home.” I follow the conventions. Have you lived here long? Yes? I understand. We’re leaving. Soon. What is this? Order. What have you done? I’ve been cleaning since 6:00 this morning while you were sleeping. You think it’s that simple here? Is stuff just lying around everywhere for no reason? Of course not! It doesn’t matter. You’ll put things right in a few days. He’s killed again. A detective called. We have to go. I’m not going anywhere. Make me some coffee. -What? -Make me some coffee! You did what wasn’t asked of you. Now do what is asked. They’re waiting for us at the crime scene. What’s there that I haven’t seen? If you like to look at bodies, go. Just make me some coffee first. -Where’s the coffee? -In the tin! -What are you doing? -The coffee. Let’s go! Coffee. -Come out from there. -I don’t want to! -Come on, come out! -I don’t want to! Come here, Vanechka. Please don’t be afraid. -Vanya, come here. -No! I don’t want to. The boy heard gunshots and hid under the bed. Time of death was around 2:00 this morning. Yes. He’s here. Valera who? -Valera, hello, dear fellow. -Hello. So did your bright little eyes see anything? Yes, I have something. Come in. There you go. What’s he doing? He’s looking around. So it turns out we have the next address? Which house is it? It’s number 34, Building 1. You bastard! There! Take that! Freeze! Hands behind your head. You won’t kill me. You can’t. Son of a bitch! I couldn’t shoot him. I’m sorry. Out of human kindness? Or out of weakness? We have a camera. At any time, he-- He’ll be in hiding now. He’s not a fool. He knows they’re looking for him. I saw him. Congratulations. He’ll pop up in another city, and it’ll start all over. Damn it. What do we know about him? He’s around 40. He’s a former athlete with a limp. He knows kids in athletics programs. The kids practice together in one group because they live in the same district. -And he knows that. -Here you go. I’m giving you a chance to redeem yourself. A young man who trained with you at the end of the ’80s, start of the ’90s. Medium height, slim. It’s possible he left due to a leg injury. -Which leg? -The left. Volodya. Volodya’s last name? Strizhenov. He showed up here. Why’d he come? He was looking for kids with talent. Thank you. -Make yourself at home. -Thank you. What are you up to? You decide to write an article this late. And you learned so late that our district… is home to such an outstanding athlete. The country should know about its heroes. He was no hero. But he could’ve been a world champion. He screwed it all up himself because he was angry and stubborn. -You could’ve been one. -No, I couldn’t! He could! I put so much effort into him. I drove him till he couldn’t see straight. And he dug in his heels. I asked him, “Do you want to be a champion?” He said, “I want to study birds.” Imagine that nonsense in his head! He was reading books about birds! Just before the Soviet championships, I tripled his workload. He had this character trait. Anyone else that stubborn would cry, but he-- He just got angry. And using that anger, he executed maneuvers you wouldn’t believe the human body was capable of. He could’ve been a champion. He could have. And then… We were practicing dismounts. I came up with one for him myself. He’d have a gold medal in his pocket for this dismount, but he… He was angry during practice. He started his dismount with a twist. He fell on his leg. Compound fracture. He could’ve been a champion… but he ended up a cripple. Even when we got this apartment, he could climb down the balconies faster than I could use the elevator. All out of spite! And how can we find Volodya? I want to hear his side. Volodya left us in ’93. You haven’t seen him since? -You haven’t tried to find him? -I tried. He didn’t want me to. -If you do see him, will you tell us? -He doesn’t need anything! He needs nothing from us… nor we from him. He had a family, a son. Do you know their address? They divorced. He doesn’t live there anymore. But Lenochka, his ex-wife, earlier on, used to let him see his son. But then he took his son to work. She got scared and stopped him from seeing him. So he got angry. During the night, he climbed over the balcony to see his son. Lenochka threatened to call the police, and he stopped. You said Volodya took his son to work. What was his job? It’s either a crane operator or in high-rise construction. Something to do with being high up. You said he loved birds. -Thank you. -Wait. If you… find him, then… tell him hello, please, from his parents. If he’ll accept it. Where should we look for him? A construction worker isn’t an artist, even if he is tortured. Did you hear anything from Glukhoi? -I’ll call him now. -Go on. Yes? Who’s this? Add my number already. Did you find out what we asked? Give me the beard. It’s for you. -Well? -I haven’t heard from any black marketers. The cops aren’t the only ones scaring them off. The feds too. Everything is under strict control. If something surfaces, they immediately have their sights on it. And if not, how could you get information about it? They won’t tell you themselves. It seems like a dead end. But listen up. While I was trying to get the information from the cops, something interesting came out. The apartment buildings where the murders occurred were recently constructed. There’s another being constructed close by. The contractor is the same. That means the workers are, too, most likely. Now then, recently the cops went to the construction site. There was a shooting there at night. Well, they showed up, walked around. It was empty. No bodies, no one. If he works here, then where does he live? What are the options? Let’s go. The Luger is an old pistol. You have to shoot it often. And it’s so simple to shoot there. Who’d be there? The construction site is next to the murders. Get the hint? He has a son, a job. Why did he start killing? Compassion breeds monsters. He wanted to save these guys… so they wouldn’t suffer the same fate. Take your pills. He saw himself in each of them. That little boy whose father forced him to be what he didn’t want to be-- Take your pills! …a world champion. He just wanted to be a child. -Thirty-eight… -I can’t! You can! You can do it all! Forty-one! Forty-two! Level I said! Level! Forty-three! Forty-four! Stop! Meglin! Help! Rodion! Look. You’ve been faking it! You weren’t having an episode. -He could’ve killed-- -I do have episodes… of love for people. Truthfully, lately less often. And I’m your trainer, after all. But you need to know how to train yourself. Okay, let’s go get your sweatshirt. It’d be a pity if it disappeared. It suits you. It will also be a pity if it doesn’t disappear. There would be questions. -And what now? -I usually buy a cactus. Actually, you can buy one too. Your very first. Esenya Andreyevna… were you aware then that he was manipulating you? He literally set you up in every case. If we’re calling a spade a spade, he used you. So you wouldn’t quit, he dangled your mother’s case in front of you like a carrot. He could’ve immediately told you everything. Couldn’t he? You don’t understand a damn thing. Instead of carrying a child on your back across the river it’s whole life… it’s better to teach him to swim. Don’t you get it? Dear Andrei, sincerely wishing you happiness. Your friend, Maksim Ognaryov. PODMOSKOVYE
