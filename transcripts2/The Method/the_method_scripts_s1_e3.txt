 -Rest. -As you should. Esen. There is no method. Meglin catches psychos because he is one himself. Do you feel it? I love you. Why did you decide to leave? Well, I thought… What could he do for me? He wasn’t a detective. He was a psycho. -I decided to search myself. -For who? My mother’s killer. TOWN OF VASILKOVO -What? -What are you listening to? Just this.

 Give it to me. -Cool song. -Yeah? Yeah, awesome. Hey, where are you going? Nowhere. I’ve been fighting with my parents. There. -No worries. It happens. -I don’t know where I’m going. I got on the first train I found, and now I need to switch, probably, and head back. Hey, maybe you wanna come with me and have some wine? Why not? -We don’t know each other. -So what? Come on. If you really don’t have anywhere to go and you don’t care, then come with me. There won’t be anyone at my house for three days. VASILKOVO Listen, I probably shouldn’t go. What’s wrong? Are you afraid of him or something? Old-timer! Can you walk in front of us? My friend is afraid. Do you see? There’s nothing to be scared of. Don’t touch me, please. Are you scared? Everything will be okay. Hush, hush. Everything will be okay. We’re going home… daughter. STEKLOV HOME CRIMINAL CASE IN THE MURDER OF VERA VYACHESLAVOVNA STEKLOVA I’m shocked. But that doesn’t change anything. I’m quitting. -Five minutes. -Two minutes. Did you read everything? There are some pages missing. What are you going to do? Look for them. TIKHVIN Sveta Prikhodka. She got off the commuter train at Vasilkovo and didn’t make it home. They combed the woods but didn’t find a body. She might be alive. We’ll go back there. You can do as you please. I need you right now. All right. Wish her bon appétit. Don’t be scared. Here, eat. I won’t! Eat, I said! The cottager and his accomplice were the primary people Sasha Khomutova was able to describe. She managed to escape. Khomutova ran track since childhood, so the cottager got tired fast. The girl did too. Khomutova went to the police. According to her description, the psycho’s companion looked strange, to say the least. She was presumed dead, but she turned out to be alive. The police first questioned the mother, but she didn’t know anything. How did Meglin explain that? Simple. Love. Hello! Inspection regarding underage persons. -I won’t take my shoes off. -Investigators were already here. -Hello. I told them everything. -It’s our duty. We’re looking at the home. Where’s your bathroom? They were friends. True, they were different. Nonetheless… kids are kids. She’ll be here soon and tell you everything. -Where is their father? -He died long ago. The girls weren’t even a year old. Excuse us. We’re going to search the room. All right? All right, go ahead. What? A survey of the residence. What else? Come on. What do you see? Well, they’re different. -Do you see any clues? -Seriously? “Holmes, what are you doing in the cupboard?” Do you mean those kinds of clues? Right now… I’m not joking. There are clues that are left after a crime, traces of what was there before. -Go on, search. -All right. Stand up! Two beds. One! And two! The window is in the middle. Where are the beds? Near the window. Near the sun! Lie down. Now lie here. What do you see? Good-bye. Good-bye! One minute, one minute. Wait. Okay. So… The beds are the same. They just have different covers. They have different lives. -Yes. -That’s a clue. What else? So… One… studies hard. The other doesn’t study at all. One is tidy. The other one is a mess. Everything is great for one… and terrible for the other. They’re very different. -But similar. -Your conclusions? The one who went missing… is the one who didn’t have a place in the sun. She didn’t go missing. She ran away… and became the cottager’s accomplice. Hello. Alisa? -Yes. -Which bed is yours? -This one. -Sit down. What’s up, Alisa? Did she beat you up? -No. -Yes, she beat the hell out of you. When no one was looking, right? -What are you silent for! -Yes! -Alechka, what happened? -Quiet! She wanted to steal your sun. But who did she steal? Sasha? Pasha? Vitya? Oleg! I heard how-- how they were… She called you, didn’t she? And you took pills. It took you 15 years to understand how the sun moves across the room? Did you even try to talk to her? I was wrong. She didn’t run away. You kicked her out. -She left on her own! -In exchange for what? I send her money every week. She got money in Lipetsk two times… and three times at the Vasilkovo station. Understood. Well, you know what to do. Do it. Sofia Zinovevna! How are you, my dear? Bertik! Bert! What are you-- stuck? Come here. -Bert! Bert! -Hello. Bert! I brought you a cake. Bert died. He was 15. For people, that’s a teenager, but he was an old man. Yes, I haven’t seen you in a while. Get acquainted. Sofia Zinovevna, this is Esenya. My daughter. She looks like me, yeah? She has your forehead. Pretty name. Were you named after Yesenin? Of course. I’ve told you a hundred times about Sofia Zinovevna. My favorite teacher. Yes, yes. Russian and literature. -Shall we have tea? -No. Wine. Red. You like it, right? It’s embarrassing for a teacher to admit that, but we aren’t in school. What, are you still working? -You’re not tired of it? -I am, but I’m still working. Rodik, the school is a circus. He came once, and it was a circus. And how are you? Are you writing? About sports. No. I’m tired of sports. Now I’m writing about the stars. It’s interesting and pays well. Well, of course. Journalists have what teachers don’t. Twenty-five years of the same thing. Everyday is probably different for you. Everything is different. Well… To teachers! To you, dear Sofia Zinovevna. To students. To you. Young people these days… I don’t know. No. We weren’t like that. They’re so… They’re so… shallow. -What are you looking for? -A knife. I’ll get one. They aren’t people, but accessories. And they all have trivial problems. -Go ahead. -Thanks. For example, my Esenchik. Sorry I’m talking about you. Do you know what she worries about the most? That her breasts are too small. “It’s not fashionable,” she says. You explain to her what’s fashionable and what’s not. My dear, soldiers have always liked big breasts. Right. Small breasts inspire poets. Goethe, François Villon, Blok… Yesenin. I can’t say for certain about Pushkin. As you know, at that time, breasts were unbound and… accentuated with a corset, but Pushkin liked small feet. I think small breasts… He probably would have more or less considered them fitting. Well, what have I been telling you? And how are you, my dear? How long have you been off barbiturates now? Three years. As you can see, I haven’t died. I’m tempted sometimes, but I manage. Thank you very much. Rodik, come see me more often. Sometimes. Come see me too. But it’s not a big deal. To our kind. Can we have some tea for the road? Daughter, go and get them. In the next room, in the cupboard. The cups are there. No. She’ll get them. Go on, hurry. CLASS 1A OF 2005 What is this… Have you seen Slavik recently? It’s been a while. Winter came. I gave him a girdle-- for his back pain. It was made of dog hair. I haven’t seen him since. Where are the cups? All right. We won’t have tea. There’s no time. You teachers taught us and deceived us children. What did you tell us? Study hard and everything will be okay. You’ll be on top, yeah? Who’s on top now? Underachievers everywhere. A society of underachievers. Were you her student? We all learn something from each other. You weren’t in the class photos. Because she’s my student. VASILKOVO What should I do-- go with you, or what? Pinochet! Mishanya! Terrific! Pinochet! Hello! Hello! Hi! I didn’t expect… Meet my wife, Marusya. Kolya. Listen, I wasn’t expecting… How long has it been? -Fifty years maybe? -Seven years. All right, 50. No. Five years. -It’s been five years. -I said seven on purpose. So you’d be even happier. You bastard! One minute. I have my own home brew here. It’s medicinal, from cranberries. It’ll add 10 years to your life. Why do you need more years, Pinochet? You’ll always be miserable. -Don’t say it. Help yourself. -She doesn’t drink. To our kind? Well, how’s life? Difficult. -It’s wearing me down. -A lot? -A lot. -I’ll teach you what to do. Remember. Let it go. Mishanya, if it weren’t for you, I’d be up to no good here. All right, let’s not. Go ahead. He saved me. Do you know… how he ended up here? God sent him here. God. I was taking a walk. It’s pretty here. Yeah? Pretty? It’s scary here. Even dogs don’t come here. Even the rats ran away. Why am I here… keeping watch? It’s not strong. I spoke too highly of it. Come with me. I have another one. One moment. There. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. This is how I live. What do you have? Show him. You’re the closest of all to Slavik. No, it’s not Slavik. He has a bad back. Arthritis. -And when did you see him? -Last winter. He bought himself a dacha. Where? Somewhere to the south. Around Tikhvin maybe. A dacha. Did he register as a farmer or something? Slavik… Yes. You have an interesting job, Mishan. -A doctor. -Yes. Only it’s not a job. It’s a calling. As they say, do no harm. What’s that, gasoline? -Grain alcohol. -Let’s have some. To our kind. I’ll show you something. Look what I’ve got here. It’s on a shaft. Isn’t it cool? Excellent! Will you come again? If only to your funeral! And then… Are they there? Let’s go. Yulia, daughter! Come here. Go get her. Okay. “Papa.” Okay, Papa. Quiet! Well, go. -Where? -There? -Alone? -Go and see what they’re doing. Me? Two deaf people today are too much for me. I’m not armed. I take the method. Is this a test or something? It’s a test. Go. This is Slavik. I wanted to cut the cake for the girls, to treat them. I’ll cut it myself, Slavik. Take a seat. He didn’t notice. I have arms. Slavik grew up in our hospital. His parents abandoned him. He bounced between orphanages, and then just wandered. And when you grew up, you decided to rescue children, right? You found them at the train station and kept them at home, in chains. For their own good. One girl cried so much… you almost strangled her. Thank God the neighbors pulled you away in time. Give me your plate. Give it to me. So, what, you went to the psych ward. Seems you would’ve settled down. Well, see, you were tempted again. But you took them for their own good. Right, Slavik? -They’re miserable. I feel sorry them. -Of course. You aren’t a murderer, Slavik? Drink your tea. Whoa! Give me that. A weapon from the stone age? PARAMEDIC It’s nice here in Tikhvin. I like it. -They do too. -Who? Let’s go. -Look what’s happening. -What are you doing? Look, look. What’s your name, huh? -Alyona. -Alyona? Is anyone waiting for you at home, Alyon? No? -My mama. -Your mama? That’s it? -My husband. -Your husband? So your husband didn’t meet you, huh? How dare he! That’s not right. He’s an irresponsible husband. -Well? What? -Let me go. -Why? -Let me go. Does it hurt? Go ahead, scream. Scream for help! Scream! Well? I can’t hear you. Louder. What was that? Go on, scream! Here, I’ll help you! Here! -Let her go! -Shut up! You wanted to help her. Help her. Come on! Seryozha! What, are you serious? Is this your husband or something? What’s with you, Seryozha? You’re late, aren’t you? What’s with you, Seryozha? You could lose your wife that way, Seryozha! And you screamed well. You need to scream right away! What are you doing? What are you doing, you animal! What, mama, did you wake up? Seryozha? Hey! What’s going on? You underachievers. What are you-- underachievers? Why are you moving like turtles? They’re raping a girl over there. What are you standing there for? Let’s go! Run! What are you, huh? An underachiever! An underachiever to everyone! You thought he wanted to… Yes. Rape her. I only realized it then. What did you realize? -He wanted to teach them. -Who? What? MIKHAILOVSK -Let’s put paste on Kapustina! -Let’s do it! -Put paste on Kapustina? -Right on the kisser.
