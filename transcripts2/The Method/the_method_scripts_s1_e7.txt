 FILM 7 First, rule breakers are called criminals. Then psychos. And, finally, prophets. Help me. You need to go to the hospital. I don’t need to go anywhere. It’s a scratch. There’s gauze in the drawer. You need stitches. Wrap it. It’ll heal. Go on. How are you?

 It passed through. Soft-tissue wound. It’ll heal like on a dog. Don’t tell anyone what you saw yesterday. And my father? Don’t tell anyone. He shot a man. Let the police at least look for him. The won’t find him, definitely not now. Papa recently started drinking a lot. I’d come home, and he’d be sleeping on the table. Until I dragged him into bed. And then all night, he’d be muttering a name. What name? The same name you spoke, at the university when you started to feel bad. Remember? Olya.

 Is it a coincidence, or… Since I was a child, I’ve had this one dream. A nightmare. It was like a monster was chasing me. It was dark. I was running, and I fell. Then I was at a dead end. There was nowhere to run. The monster loomed over me… and actually took me out of the dark. But I wasn’t afraid of him. I was afraid that he’d turn out to be someone I know. Do you understand? I feel this is connected-- Ognarev, the fact that Papa doesn’t like me working with you, Olya. You know everything. Tell me. Do you feel it? I love you. The pharmacy has something for your headache. Should I get it? No need. It’s going away. Shall we continue? You’ve had these since your breakdown? -What significance does that have? -A direct one. The breakdown happened on the job. Taking that into account, I need to check your professional and psychological fitness. Tell me all about it. In Malodementevsk, outside Moscow, a serial killing started. The killer attacked on Saturdays. He killed people brutally, without any particular motive. He left signs. -Keep your dog on a leash. -He doesn’t bite. You can’t walk fighting dogs without a muzzle, you know? And who are you? Stop recording! He’s already bitten a child. That’s not enough for you? It was the boy’s fault! He teased him. Stop recording! “Beware-- vicious dog” signs make me mad. A dog isn’t vicious or good. Animals don’t have morals. They do what man sets them to. The sign should read: “Beware-- vicious owner.” Do you understand what I’m saying? The owner made the dog this way. He broadcasts aggression and evil into the world. Should we endure this? Or should we teach him a lesson? And through him, teach another. Look at this subhuman and consider. Is he making the world better, or will it be better without him? It’s up to you. UPLOADING FILE BEWARE-- VICIOUS OWNER! WHAT NEXT? Look at the road, not at me. You don’t like that I’m driving? Ego. You didn’t have to take that bullet. It would have been better if it had hit you. MALODEMENTEVSK / SEPTEMBER 11 POLICE Don’t smoke here. Major Meglin? Move over. -He’s… -Having a bad day. Yes, I see. -Did they shoot the dog? -Yes, and took it away. I feel sorry for the dog. What do you see? Dog food. He stunned him, then cut his face and spread food on it. The dog chewed his owner’s face. Time of death? Between 6:30 and 7:00 a.m. The wife was questioned. He took a walk that time every morning. What’s this? His signature. Three bodies so far. Niyazov, a maintenance worker. Lishenko, a businessman. And Gavrilov here, a civil servant. He attacks from behind, stunning them. The trauma is consistent with a hammer. Then he kills them all differently. He drove a funnel into Niyazov’s mouth and poured acetone in it. He choked. Creative approach. What happened to the second? -He drilled him. -What did he drill? In his ear, with a portable drill. And you say I’m sick. Are the victims connected? It hasn’t been determined. All the men are aged 40 to 53. They lived here in Silikatny. According to our databases, none of them came through here. What? You said there are three bodies, but there are four pins. Sergei survived. Our colleague. He works as a beat cop in this district. There’s a witness. He helped put together a composite sketch. There’s a composite sketch. The Sabbatarian stunned him but didn’t kill him. The son intervened. He saved his father’s life. Well, if you’d call it a life. What do you see? -Where’s the bathroom? -Left, right, then straight ahead. SERGEI YASHIN’S APARTMENT Please, come in. I’m sorry. Now, Papa, we’re going to talk. That. Papa asked me to hang that up. It might help him remember. Fedya. Father took a walk every day… in the evening. He took me with him. There’s a road there along the park… a path. He ran out of cigarettes and… sent me to buy some. When I came back, he was being beaten under a street lamp. I yelled and started to call for help. He straightened up, looked at me and ran into the park. Did you manage to get a look at him? It was dark there. I only saw how tall he was. Papa is probably 6’2”. He’s… probably about the same. Is this your mom? Yes. She was killed. Ten years ago-- a car wreck. Are you working or in school? I’m in school. I’m a sophomore. Right now, I’m taking a break. PRAYERS HYMN - “THANK GOD FOR EVERYTHING” Papa is very religious. I hope it helps him. In what way? Well… He’ll be like this for the rest of his life. He can hear and understand everything… but he can’t speak or move. How did they do the composite sketch? He can move a finger. Twice for “yes.” Once for “no.” The artist worked on it for four days. Can I talk to him? Yes, only you… have to ask questions where he can answer “yes” or “no”. -Twice for “yes” and once for “no”. -Yeah. So, excuse me. Now. I’ll do it myself. Seryozh, do you hear me? He hears me. Seryozh, here’s what I think. Life-- is it worth it to continue to live… like this? Please leave. -Quiet, quiet. -Please leave. Please leave. Please leave! Please leave. Outside! Fedya, I’m sorry for that. Is it possible for you to not drink? I only drink when I have to. Did you find something? A connection between the victims. All are newcomers, except the beat cop. That means not all of them. There’s one “but.” What kind of logic is that? You’re not looking in the right place. Their similarity is in their differences. How is that? The way they were murdered? He doesn’t kill random people for no reason. Right? He follows them, prepares the attack. He has a motive. There’s a rationale. I talked with the locals. Not many will be crying over the dead. In fact, it’s the opposite. Gavrilov-- the dog bit someone’s little boy, almost gnawed him to death. Gavrilov paid his way out of it. The businessman also pissed everyone off. He bought up the floor-level apartments. There were three years of repairs. The ruckus, the noise. Only they didn’t file complaints. It was pointless. The drill. The drill. And it seems this janitor was dealing drugs, so… It’s easier on people. They’ve started sleeping peacefully. They let their children go to the park. One of them told me, “If I wouldn’t go to jail for it, I’d kill them all myself.” He kills those who hurt others. He kills sinners with their own sins. And now he’s going to accelerate. He’s a killer on a mission, working for the public good. These three were a warm-up, a primer. Now he’s going to create his masterpiece. -He’s just waiting. -For what? For us to arrive. WHAT NEXT? All right. I’ll be there soon. POLICE What do you mean “exploded?” He put a charge inside her and lit it. Have you found out who she is? We’re working on it. She didn’t have a phone or an ID. We’re checking her prints. Come here. What do you see? A dog lover. It’s lined with silk. It’s for people. -A prostitute. -Excellent. The dress. He asked her to dress subtly, so that his neighbors won’t snitch. The wife’s away. What’s this? She came by gypsy cab or taxi. -Run the taxi drivers. -We’ll do it. Come here. Look at this. She put up a fight, made noise. He had no time to drag her away. She was killed near her destination. It’s the Bermuda Triangle there. There’s two nine-story buildings. He waited for her by the entrance. He knew exactly when she’d arrive. He knew her. The Sabbatarian called her. Well, finally! Did I have to pull that out with pliers? Canvass the houses with her photo. Is there a password? -There is. -What is it? -Sherlock. -What? Sherlock. Sherlock? Sherlock, damn. THREE HOURS LATER… CALL LIKA AND GELYA You’re still wearing the collar. There were no keys in her purse. Someone’s supposed to open the door for her when she gets home. Correct? Look what I found. Here. Does it match? The necklace is similar. Lika and Gelya-- a sweet pair. Just so. A world of luxury and scandal. Hello. -Hello. -Quickly. The neighbors. There it is, the den of debauchery. Tea? Coffee? What’s your name? Lika. Lika, where’s your friend? She’s not home. You didn’t call. Is this her? Was she from Moldovia? We came here together. I talked her into it. What will I tell her mother now? Did she have any strange acquaintances? Everyone here is weird. They’re normal in Moldovia, but here they’re… I mean aggressive, cruel, mean. There was one guy. He got an STD and said it was from Gelya. She was clean. She was checked. What kind of customer was he? What was his name? Igor I think. I didn’t see him. But his wife left him. He proposed that Gelya live with him. She was afraid, and he tipped off the cops that she didn’t have proper papers because she wouldn’t go along. Then he talked her into visiting him again. Why? She liked him. She loved tall guys. She’s still so young. She was 19. Where did she see him? In Silikatny. She also told me he had tattoos on his hands. What kind? Crosses. Just admit that I’m right. All the victims are newcomers. -And the beat cop? -It’s possible he knew something. Newcomers make up half the city here. Unlock the car. But the swastika on the hand and that fist? Can you admit just once that I’m right? Me. We found the cab driver. He took her to Lenin Street, number 20. Did you get a list of the residents? Check all the Igors. One more thing. Do you have any, how would you say, Nazi friends? My colleague wants to talk to them. Ones who are working for us? No. Well, we know who they are. All of them, Sherlock. Get to work, go. Unlock the car. -Did you tell anyone why you called them? -No. Igor Yakovlevich asked me not to tell anyone. Correct. Fighting crazies is a… nationwide job. But it’s quiet. -Do you want my opinion? -Well? I don’t think he’s the killer. He does what everyone wants to. And you too? GLORY TO RUSSIA RUSSIA FOR RUSSIANS Vitalik, what are the cops doing here? Everything’s fine. Come in. Guys-- Why are you standing there? Hey, you! -Hello. -Hello. Hey! Guys, look what these pigs are doing. What’s the deal? -What are you doing? -Hey! Hands off. Let’s go. -Listen, pig, what are you doing? -Get away from the car. What’s with you, woman? -Show some respect! -Hey! Where are you going? Let him go. -Hey! -What are you doing? He immediately started to smash it. Got it? That means there’s something important inside. I don’t know. I’ll take a look. All right, I’m going. Bye. I’ll only talk with an attorney present. You’ll have a lawyer. You’ll have one, Igorek. Only he’ll come and go, and you’ll still be here. And you won’t be sitting in a cell with me or your attorney. You’ll be with hardened cons. Those guys will tear your tattooed hide to pieces. But if you start talking, everything will be easier. If you talk to us, be open about things, we’ll be civil to you. Yeah? Yeah… But only with my attorney present. Well, all right. All right. You don’t have anything on me. MOSCOW - FSB ARCHIVES / SEPTEMBER 12 Hello. -Hey. -Hello. Does your mother let you read this sort of stuff? Give it to me. Zhen, I’m serious. Give it to me. Here. Don’t get worked up. Since when are you on the case? I don’t have anything to say to you. Wow, we’ve really talked a lot. Have you forgotten she was my classmate too? I have a theory. But it needs to be checked. And as soon as I learn something, or if I need your help, I’ll call you right away. Uh-huh. Do you promise? You’ll really call? Screw off, Zhen. He has a theory. A theoretician. LIGHTNING With this kind of evidence, the court would tell you to screw off. He called the deceased an hour before her death and threatened her. Yura, who? A prostitute? He called her. Of course, let’s be judges of morality. What ties him to the murder? Do you have prints? Witnesses? You have nice shoes. Are they expensive? -I work within the framework of the law. -I understand. Let’s go. Here’s how it is, Yur. He’s going to be released now, and I won’t bring up the assault. What’s today-- Friday? I’ll put people on him. Let him try something. Glukhoi. Yes. He went into a closed online community. It’s like a club based on shared interests. Snuff, porno, torture. 600 subscribers, password-protected. Well, judging by the user names, they’re white nationalists and Nazis. Perverts basically. WEAPONS PASSWORD: User SKIN just logged in. He’s online. He has a second computer. Let’s go, Sherlock. Yes, Fedya. Fedya called. Yashin is ready to make an identification. See Yashin. As soon as he makes the identification, call me. POLICE Yes. It’s him. Yes? Seryoga identified him. Let’s do it! SPECIAL FORCES -Get down! -Police! Everyone freeze! Don’t move! Guys, I just replaced that door. Easy, easy. -This time you’ll talk, bitch. -You’re too late. Too late. Well, what? It’s too late. It’s already online. MESSAGE FROM THE SABBATARIAN Guys, the Sabbatarian sent an e-mail. Open it. -I’m sorry we were so late. -It’s okay. I hope that we helped. Excuse me. Esenya. Citizens-- brothers and sisters. Look how we live. We’re surrounded by falsehood, wickedness… hypocrisy, lies. We no longer honor the law. Who are you? We don’t honor God. Over the course of a month, I punished the lost people in our community. I cleaned up my city. It was my Sabbath. I invite you to join me. Of all wicked men, the worst is the one who is vested with power. Meet Esenya Steklova. She’s 22 years old and already a detective for major crimes. Our protector. This is her car. Her father, Ministry of Justice Senior Counselor Andrei Steklov. Their humble country home. And now look how Esenya Steklova protects us. Tell me honestly. Do you believe she’s protecting you? Or is it you who needs to be protected from her? It’s up to you. Vote “for” or “against.” For the safety of your children. For order in the streets. For honest authorities. The beat cop. They must have all gone through him. Call Esenya. Time is up. Fedya. -She… -I understand. Let’s go! Fedya. Esenya! Pop, is Mama coming home? Pop? Is Mama coming back? Is Mama coming back? Mama died. Pray. Pop, I don’t understand. Pray. Pray. I don’t understand. What is this? What is this? A “D”! Are you a dumb ass? Are you stupid? As we agreed. It seems we didn’t agree. Dear Papa, please play with me. -Next month, you’ll bring more. -Dear Papa, please. How will that work? Go play with yourself. A great gift. Obviously. Well? Shall we pour it? All in a row. Well, where are you? Are we going to do it or not? Who are you? What are you doing here, you brat? Get out of here! Hi, Pop. Take a walk? What? What the hell is this? Don’t do that. Pray! I said pray! Well! Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread… and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For you are our Lord now, always, and forever. Amen. Where are you? What’s your name? Do you remember? Where’s Esenya? Glukhoi called. He located her phone. All right. WHAT NEXT? Wait here. I’ll speak. Where is she? -Don’t come any closer. -Where is she? Move to the right. I can’t hear out of my left ear. He burst my eardrum. Can I sit? If a hair on her head is harmed, you’ll wish you were never born. For 18 years, I wished I was never born. You think you can threaten me with pain? I’ve had nothing else but that. Did your father mock you? You could’ve killed him. Why the others? -They’re innocent. -Innocent? I saw how they brought him money, how he did a prostitute on Mother’s bed. Who’s innocent there? He taught me… duty, love for our homeland. And he took bribes… and shut his eyes when he was asked to. Listen, how about this? You let her go, and I’ll help you get into a mental facility instead of prison. No. These four weeks were the best of my life. I said something, and people listened to me. And, within a week, someone just like me will appear. And within a month, hundreds. Because I did what others want to do but can’t. The people are for me. No, Fedya. You aren’t the chosen one. You’re just covering your own sickness with this bullshit. Where is Esenya? She’s alive. But she’ll die. Soon. And you can’t do anything about it. Actually, more people voted against. A lot more. They think you’re a psycho. Look. Look, look. I’ll wait. Give me a smoke. Look for the car. What? Look for the car! -Let’s go. -Cover the area. Here, here! Call an ambulance. First, he cut down his father in the park when things boiled over. Then he probably realized how easy it is to kill, even if your opponent is stronger. But he couldn’t just kill like that. That meant recognizing his illness. He went online and found a community that shared his interests. He found an audience. He used it expertly. He put up Gelya as the first candidate. He drove up the votes with her. Your excesses were supposed to be the death of you. He was full of ironies. Let me try. Gimme, gimme. People were against it? Do you want the truth? I was against it. Take her away. Bye. Yura. You need to change that password. How come you never shot anyone? Meglin said, one time… a pistol deceives you. It gives you a false sense of safety and security-- that it’s easy to kill. But you mustn’t kill… until your hands are ready. NIZHNY NOVGOROD I’m probably keeping you, aren’t I? What’s the rush. It’s so beautiful.
