MOSCOW / 1971 - SCHOOL No. 585 Since then, children, almost 30 years have passed. But we remember and honor Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya’s heroic act. I’m going to show you some pictures.

 Think about what this girl was going though. She wasn’t much older than you are. Look at this. And remember it. Her body hung for a month. And right before the New Year, drunken Germans, after Zoya was already dead… undressed her and began stabbing her body… with bayonets. Do you feel it? I love you. You know, based on this evidence, I get the impression that he was just a con artist.

 He’d take out all the killers on the spot. What for? So that we couldn’t question them? Did you ever notice the murders would stop after that? But we don’t know why. The murderers could have gone into hiding, could be lying low. How many times have we put away the wrong person? I understand. You became close. But think about it. -A drug addict, an alcoholic-- -That’s not true! A lunatic who was simply fooling everyone. He made up this “method”-- -Don’t you dare say that! -…that no one understood. What kind of method is it? What’s it about? Esenya Andreyevna, I don’t condone my colleague’s fervor, but I share his frustration. Starting with the Tsvetkov case, you and Meglin worked as equals, and at times you’d replace him without compromising the case or using the method. Starting with the Tsvetkov’s case… I used it too. There was no rape. She was hanged while still alive, just like the other two. Not quite. I can stop if you already know everything. Palych, pride is a foolish quality to have in a medical examiner. Don’t leave me hanging. I’m not a medical examiner. I’m an expert. I’m telling you-- pride. Why did you say “not quite”? Did you see the skin on her neck? When a victim is conscious, the body will jerk in the noose. It leaves ligature marks on the neck, especially on the delicate skin of women. And the ligature marks… aren’t here. I have better things to do than marvel at the delicate skin of a corpse. You said it, then paused so that I’d ask you, right? You know something, but you’re not saying it. Do you want to impress me? So, go ahead. She was hanged while she was still alive, but… unconscious, right? No, not unconscious. But she was not conscious either. How’s that? You’re scaring me. Here’s how. You’ll never guess what I found in their stomachs. A signed confession. Next. No. Sponge cake. -With a sedative. -I wish. I analyzed the composition, but it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. The cake contained tropane alkaloids-- scopolamine. -What is it? -A truth serum. The military uses it in interrogations. It suppresses willpower. The victim realizes everything that’s going on, but can’t resist. Most interestingly, the scopolamine in the cake was not in the form of a drug but rather in its natural form. And it only occurs naturally in Datura innoxia. Does he grow that Datura at home? Oh, Palych. Give me the flask. -Where is it? -In the glove box. What’s this? Morphine. Hi, ladies! Yes, Dad. Can you spare a cigarette? Of course I am. Who else would I be with? -What? -Thank you. What do you mean “get some rest?” I don’t really feel tired. No, Dad, it’s a good idea, but-- Why does it bother him so much that I work with you? Who’s gonna like his daughter sleeping with a maniac? I’m not sleeping with you. Right. How are you going to prove that to him? What are you doing all this time with me? Learning? Ridiculous! What can I teach you? I’m not a teacher. Are you the detective? Yes. Good afternoon. Victor Suchkov. You must have gotten teased as a kid, right? No. Excuse me, you are… the strength, the inviolability of family bonds. Family values determine… the stable social, demographic, and even economic growth of any state. This determines… To conclude this lecture, I’d like to emphasize that preserving the institution of the family… is a strategic goal of all ideologies regardless of their political systems. Basically, the family has been the main ideological institution… throughout the entire history of humanity. Thank you. Class dismissed. Let’s go. So, this is Sergei Leonidovich, the head of the Department of Family Psychology. Major Meglin and Lieutenant Steklova from the Investigative Committee. We’re listening. You know, there is-- It’s not that I suspect him or anything. I just have to inform you that there’s a professor in the Department of Extreme Psychology-- Zhukov Andrei Ivanovich. And? And he pays… special attention to the female students. I’ve told him that this goes against… Never mind. I shouldn’t be saying any of this. No, you’re doing the right thing. -Is he here today? -He’s giving a lecture right away. He… There he is. Hello. Good afternoon. Excuse me. May we sit in on your lecture? We heard it’s very interesting. Excuse me, who are you? We’re from EMERCOM. We’re here to learn. You were recommended as an expert on extreme psychology. Well, have a seat. The factors intensifying traumatic stress are the perception of an event as highly unfair, the inability or incapacity to deal with the situation, at least to some extent, and finally, passive behavior, the presence of unresolved trauma, as well as physical exhaustion. Also, a destabilizing organization of work and the specialist’s state of health. Good physical health as well as corporate culture. -Thus, we can draw the conclusion-- -It’s him. …that the psychology of the victim is the main reason… Of course. Why not? He has access to students. He’s very charming. Look at her. She’s ready to give herself to extreme psychology right now. …and does not give in to primal instincts. In short, your well-being is in your own hands. What are they talking about? I think he’s offering to continue the lecture in a private setting. For a deeper analysis, so to speak. We should follow him. TWO HOURS LATER There we go. Let’s hurry. Come on. Let’s go. Can you hurry up? Hurry up. They’re in here. -Over here? -In here. So? He’s not gonna do it here. He has to feed her the scopolamine first. You’re thinking logically. I think this is what he’s doing right now. So we need to wait until he feeds her the cake? Of course it’s cynical, but we’ll catch him red-handed. Before he starts saying, “It’s not mine. They planted it.” -We’ll wait. -Of course. Why does he kill? He doesn’t look like an awkward geek who was bullied as a child. He’s attractive. Women like him. Why does he do this? We’ll ask him. Get off her, you pig! What’s going on? What are you doing? -Did you have cake? -What? Did you have cake, you idiot? No! Well, congratulations, pal. I gotta hand it to you. -What number is she? -What’s going on? Is it for a grade, or is it love? It’s up to you, but he has another 20 years of teaching here. So you’re not gonna be the last one. Here’s my advice. Get this “till death do us part” nonsense out of your head and go after the sex. You’ll gain experience and good grades. We should have the cake tested. Most definitely. Are you mocking me? You knew it wasn’t him! You gotta get some lumps of your own. Other people’s lumps don’t hurt. -Right, Professor? -Yes. Sorry to have interrupted. Devil knows what goes on in this place! Devil knows what. Hello, Andrei Sergeyevich. Did you get here okay? You must have hit some traffic. I was trying to meet somewhere close. Sasha, I don’t have much time. Okay. Andrei Sergeyevich, I saw Esenya, and she’s changed a lot. I think this training isn’t good for her. Get to the point, Sasha. I know you want to get her back. I know how to do it. But I need your help. And? I need access to Zakharova’s case files. Anulya, our classmate. -Bon appétit. -Thank you. We’ve been sitting here for three hours. What for? I haven’t had a salad this horrific since high school. -Wanna try some? -No, thanks. No, thank you. I didn’t get any sleep. Mom was working the night shift, and I had to babysit, so… Natashka woke up twice last night. She started screaming, “Where’s Mommy?” Then Maskimka joined in, and they started bawling together. It took me an hour to put them to bed. Then I had to make them breakfast in the morning, get them ready for school. I must have gotten 15 minutes of sleep. You think he’ll walk by and you’ll smell him? Are you looking for his victim? No. I’m trying to understand how he selects them. -And how? -Thank you, girls, but I’m good. I need to stop by the pharmacy after… after class. I have to make sure everyone eats in the morning, their books are… And I need to drop them both off at school. That’s crazy. You’re babysitting and studying. It must be hard. -No, not really. -Yeah, it’s hard. It’s hard being a big sister. I know it firsthand. But it’ll make being a mom easier. -Bon appétit! -Thank you! Who’s that? We saw him, remember? He came by. He seems cool. We should get his phone number. He doesn’t have a phone. Whatever. There’s no scopolamine in your cake. -Besides, it’s store-bought. -So what? In the previous cases, the cakes had a high yolk content. So he made the cakes too? Turns out he’s also a pastry chef. The victim’s parents are here. I’ll call them in about five minutes. They’re with the psychologist right now. All right. I’m in no rush. Suchok! I mean-- Lieutenant. -You-- -Captain. Right. The psychologist’s office-- don’t shut the door all the way. Okay? -Okay. -Thank you. I know my words aren’t going to bring Liza back, but you should be thinking about life right now, not death. You have two young boys at home. If you give up now, they will be the ones to suffer. I think Liza wouldn’t want that. She’d want you to remember her but to go on living. Life goes on. Your life goes on, and so do your kids’ lives. It’s okay. It’s okay. Yes. -Of course. -Hush, hush. Yes. Hush, hush. Excuse me. Are you a doctor? -I’m not. -Damn it! -What happened? -There’s a baby. I thought-- I came up to the car, something’s meowing. I wanted to scare it off. Then I see a foundling, all blue. I pulled it out, but I don’t know what to do. I’m not a doctor, but I know first aid. Thank you! It’s in the car. This way. -Is it still breathing? -Yes. Where’s the baby? Quiet, quiet. Get over here. Quiet, psychologist. You were asking how you get a woman into a car? Very easy. Tell her there’s a sick baby. She’ll run to save it. No questions asked. The instinct will kick in. A woman is a mother. A mother is a victim. Got it? She got it. Let her go. This was a drill-- in extreme psychology. You should be more careful about giving first aid to psychopaths you don’t know. Got it? And you should teach people to be careful. Get out of here. You pig! Sometimes I think I wanna kill you. Call Suchok. Find out how many brothers and sisters the early victims had. Call. Go ahead. Why didn’t you say anything right away? This is what they had in common. You didn’t think? What got in the way? What got in the way of thinking? I see. They all came from large families. You knew that. How did you know? You need to ask the right question. It’s not how I knew, but what it means. So? The killer is trying to relive his childhood. Is he also from a large family? If Suchok said this, I’d understand, but you… Keep thinking. So? A large family is like a pack. The common good comes before self-interest. This is where good parents, true friends, heroes, and victims of killers come from-- that is, everyone who believes in the goodness of people and helps their neighbor. So? So all the girls were brought up that way… and he used that? Yes. He doesn’t take risks. KOMSOMOLSKY PROSPEKT CITY CENTER Natasha. My favorite girl. I haven’t seen you in a hundred years. -And I could go another hundred without. -Really? Your latest? -Something like that. -Not bad. -You think? -Uh-huh. Why are you standing around? Go. Will you wait here? -I thought you were a blonde. -I’m smarter now. -A cigarette? -Will you go already? We all unfortunately know that three students from our university became the victims of a serial killer. And today, our guests from the competent authorities will talk to you about how to stay safe. The floor is yours. So, I want everyone to be quiet. Quieter. Today’s lecture-- how to avoid becoming a victim of a serial killer. Raise your hand if you think you’re a victim. Don’t be shy. -No victims here, huh? -No. But the person who’s hunting you disagrees. He knows who the victims here are, and his attacks aren’t random. So to avoid becoming his prey… you need to know two things about the hunter: what he wants and what he’s afraid of. Sometimes the two are the same thing. Now, my assistant… will demonstrate what he wants. Natash. Come this way. Come on. What’s going on? Wow! I don’t understand what’s going on! -Please stop this immediately. -Is that it? -That’s it. -The lecture’s over. Thank you. Did you have fun? Should we go dancing sometime? Bye. Thank you! Is she one of yours? She sure is. One of ours. -An exhibitionist. -No! That’s a rude word. Natasha is a beautiful young lady. So that’s your type. So, do you know who he is now? What about you? -What do you want? -What is it? -Olya, what do you want? -What is it? What are you-- Hang on! Hang on. Everyone step back! Call Bergich! PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL No. 13 Oneiroid syndrome. What’s that? Acute psychosis. -May I see him? -Not right now. It might be unsafe for him… as well as for you. He needs complete rest… and isolation. At least for a few days. FROM ZHENYA I’M OUTSIDE. COME OUT. What are you doing here? Hi. I missed you too. How’d you find out about this place? Because I happen to be a detective. And not the worst one, I hope. They told me at the station that Meglin had a stroke. Not true. He just-- Never mind. Listen, I was thinking… You’re off today, you’re depressed. Let’s spend a night in a cloud of smoke and a drunken haze. I’m your dealer of happiness for tonight. Then what the hell are friends for? Let’s go. Zhenya, thank you for your kind concern, but I have to work. So what you’re trying to say is that, from that moment on, you conducted the investigation on your own? No. How’d you do it then? Have you ever put together a jigsaw puzzle? Let’s say I have. You think you’re painting the picture. Only it’s already been painted. You just need to put the pieces together. He gave them to me. All the murdered girls… attended the same university. Are you looking for his victim? I’m trying to understand how he selects them. Thank you, girls, but I’m good. Mom was working the night shift. I had to babysit, so… Yeah, it’s hard. It’s hard being a big sister. I know it firsthand. But it’ll make being a mom easier. I don’t even know how to thank you. You opened it so effortlessly and didn’t even break it. The lock is rubbish. -It’ll be 500 rubles. -Sure. Thank you. Datura. It takes years to learn how to use it to defend yourself. And we don’t have time. -Thank you for keeping it safe. -Why aren’t you in the hospital? What am I supposed to do there? Here’s what I realized. If you figure out who he is, you’ll go see him, and he’ll treat you to some cake. And I’ll never see my knife again. It has too many memories. How many times do I have to tell you? Lock the door. Right away. I’ve already locked it. Yeah, I missed you too. I read that in ancient times, they called this flower… angel’s trumpet. Did it say what kind of angel? The angel of death. Hey. What is it? Needle marks from a syringe. So, in low doses, it suppresses willpower. Moderate doses-- the victim loses consciousness. I wonder what it does when used in high doses. When shamans simply wanted not to kill the enemy, but to evoke fear, they used the sap of Datura. And? They believed that, on his deathbed, a person experiences such hallucinations and suffers such agony that even the gods could not endure it. I wonder what kind of agony? I should see it for myself. I’m joking. I promised to bring some to Palych. He’s an enthusiast of rare poisons. Why do you have morphine in the car? Are you also a drug addict? What do you mean by “also”? And why are you interrogating me? What do you see? This is his mother’s room. She died, but the room’s exactly the same way. Go on. Some books were read more than others. She was a teacher. He grew up without a father. -What about the father? -He either died or left them. Did he die, or did he leave? The armchair. The armchair? She’d put out rarely and reluctantly. He stopped sleeping in the same bed. He bought himself an armchair. He lived in it, and then, one day, he just left. And she found herself alone. She was just like that with her son. Everything to do with sex was taboo. All the women were undressed but not raped, because the mother was all buttoned-up. -Was he impotent? -No. Was nudity like sex for him? Simply seeing a naked woman… That’s right. I think the first girl laughed really hard. He’d just get the rest of them drunk so they wouldn’t remember anything. He kept working this way until he learned there’s a science called botany. This is the only way he ever pictured a woman. He decided to become a psychologist so he could learn about himself. And he learned-- only not about himself but about the psychology of victims. The girls he selected were potentially ready for that. How did he… lure them? A girl from a large family is used to sacrificing herself for her younger siblings. Being a victim is also a habit. He didn’t lure them. -He simply asked for help. -Help with what? With what they know best-- watching kids. He has no kids. I checked. Do you want to see the second room? If I’m wrong, this is yours. “The kids are asleep. How about tea and some cake?” We can’t just sit here. We know everything. We have to arrest him. Or are you a sadist? Do you get pleasure from torture? What do you think? Here they are. What do you want? Leave me alone! -Come back here! -Leave me alone! -Come back here! -What do you want? What do you want? Please don’t hit me! Please! -Come here! -Please don’t! You animal-- Hey, man! Hey! What are you doing, huh? That’s enough! What are you doing? You got a smoke? I have a question for you. You ate the cake with them so that they wouldn’t suspect anything, right? How? A little bit at a time… for two years… with food… There you go. You built up an immunity to the toxin. That’s good. Didn’t you want to die? Why didn’t you kill yourself? I’m very sorry. I won’t do it again. I’m sorry. I… I swear on my life. Let’s go to work, huh? Don’t! Please don’t! I have a daughter, too, you animal. Labor changed apes into slaves. Let’s go. Go ahead. But slowly. Don’t tear him apart right away. You’ll spoil all the fun. Don’t! Stop! I’m begging you! Stop! You can’t do this! Haven’t you heard them-- saying how they’ll repent, how they want to live? Tell her how much you want to live. She’ll believe you. She’s kindhearted. I’m sorry. I’ll atone for this my entire life. I’ll atone with my whole life! With my whole life-- Did you hear that? He’ll atone with his life. Come on, let him go. Cut the ropes. He’ll be laughing at you later. I was once foolish enough to let someone go. He swore to God, pleaded. I believed him and let him go. He killed two more within the week. That’s why I believe in only one atonement-- that of blood. Here and now. Don’t! Please… don’t! I can’t have this on my conscience. And I can? Don’t you dare! No! Captain. I just need a minute. You’re lucky. She has a good heart. We need a doctor! Now! Now! We need a doctor here! Get out of the way! Step back! Let’s go. Do something! Everyone step back! Step back! Maybe you can tell me where we’re going. That pistol in your mother’s case-- do you want to meet its owner? Is he alive? Are we going to see him? Can you just answer me? You must be trying to say thank you. Am I right? Thank you. What are you so happy about? I’ve looked for him in every database. Nothing. It seemed Ognarev just vanished, as if he never existed. -How’d you find him? -The same way I found you. -I think I found you. -You dreamt it. Stop! Here’s Ognarev. Don’t. We want to talk. Like you talked to them? To talk? Yeah? No! You’re not gonna take me! Put the rifle down! We’re just gonna ask a couple of questions. Put it down! No! Rodion! -Are you okay? -He’s a bad shot. WHAT’S NEXT? - OPINION POLL IMMIGRANT SCUM - ELECTED OFFICIALS GAYS - A DUMB SLUT GANG MEMBER - DRUG DEALER A DIRTY COP ELECTED OFFICIALS - GAYS - 92 VOTES ACETONE
