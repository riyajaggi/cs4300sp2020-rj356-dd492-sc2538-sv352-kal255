 [RuPaul] Previously on RuPaul's Drag Race... You'll be starring in LADP. [siren] -Get it. -Ma'am, ma'am. Oh! Ma'am, get off the car. -Grab him. -Yeah, oh, yeah. Oh god, hold on. I switched roles with Brooke Lynn so she would feel more comfortable, and it kind of threw me off my game.

 [RuPaul] Vanjie and Plastique. There was no way for anyone to get in there. With both of you, it was a bit of a free-for-all. [RuPaul] A'Keria C. Davenport. You always had new bits happening. Working with you was one of the highlights for me yesterday. Con-drag-ulations. You are the winner of this week's challenge. [applause] Vanjie, shantay you stay. Plastique Tiara, sashay away. Whew. Bitch. Oh, Lord, girl. [Shuga] Plastique has been eliminated,

 and we are just all so surprised that she is no longer with us. [Vanjie] The bitch has nice handwriting. Not only is she pretty, but she got pretty handwriting. That is a true diva. [Shuga] How you feeling, Vanj? Girl, like I'm not done fighting. [Vanjie] So I have a lot of thoughts going through my head. A lot of the times, the judges are telling me you have this natural born gift, and they'll praise me on that. But then I go to do that in a challenge, and it's almost like, oh, I just need Vanjie. I'm trying to figure out exactly what they want from me. Like I'm just confused. [Brooke Lynn] Congrats, A'Keria. Who would have thought your thot twerking ways would get you a good old win. Baby. [laughs] Do not take that roach with ya. [all laugh] They thought you was a roach. [Silky] I got called a roach today, bitch. A roach. I guess one thing about roaches, we don't die, we multiply, bitch, so get used to me, honey. I ain't dying in this competition. [Shuga] Brooke Lynn, how you feeling? You like redeemed yourself today. [Brooke Lynn] I did. I feel fantastic that I'm still here. I worked really hard, and it fucking paid off. Congratulations. Thank you. I feel amazing. I didn't know what to expect going in, and I couldn't be more happy. [Nina] She's talking about how she was so proud to be in the top, but in this challenge, I worked really closely with her. She didn't even acknowledge the work that I helped her with, and I was kind of like... that was kind of bullshit. I mean, I think Brooke Lynn and I did a lot of really good work together, and I'm proud that Brooke Lynn was in the top and almost won. I did. I brought myself back from the dead. [Nina] As much as we're friends, I made some sacrifices that I probably shouldn't have. Brooke Lynn is in it to win it. I have to focus on myself. Now let's get the fuck out of drag. -All right. -Done. Done. [all laugh] [Yvie] The way it stands right now, Brooke Lynn, Silky, and A'Keria are leading our pack with two wins apiece. Made it out alive. Ain't gonna be in the bottom no more. [A'Keria] There are girls falling behind. At this point, get it together or get lost. Plane ticket, train ride, Uber. Go on back to the house. [RuPaul] The winner of RuPaul's Drag Race receives a one-year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics and a cash prize of $100.000. With extra special guest judges Katherine Langford and Gina Rodriguez. ♪ RuPaul's Drag Race ♪ ♪ May the best woman ♪ ♪ Best woman win ♪ [laughs] Come on, Calgary stampede. It's a brand new day, ladies and gentlemen, and there's only seven ho's on the chopping block. And this ho ain't going nowhere. [alarm] [RuPaul] Ooh, girl. She done already done had herses. My magical queens. Hocus pocus, y'all ready to steal focus? Just add some bippity boppity Ru, and you can make the competition disappear. [cheers and applause] Hello, hello, hello. [cheers and applause] -Hi, Ru. -Oh, shit. [RuPaul] Ladies, now if a queen wants to go all the way, she needs to learn how to work well other people and shit, because what happened was they would tell her, you ain't working well with people. [all laugh] Speaking of others, ♪ Oh, Pit Crew ♪ [cheers and applause] -Oh. -Oh. [cheers] Delta! [cheers] Oh, my wig. Delta Work, what are you doing here? I figured it was a good day to come check out the set. [all laugh] Well, darling, you have impeccable timing. No, just a really good sense of smell. [all laugh] Ladies, for today's Mini Challenge, we're playing a game called Balls to the Wall. [all laugh] [RuPaul] Now each of you will be paired with one of these gorgeous, hot menseses who are wearing underwear provided by Dirt Squirrel. [chuckles] Now, the queen who gets the most balls in the sack fastest wins. Oh, and one more detail. You can't use your hands. Now, instead, I'll pick a card to determine each pair's position. You know, hip to hip, shoulder to butt, ass to ass. [cheers] Yeah! Don't worry, girls. I got this. Now, Delta, would you be willing to be our ball girl? I'm everybody's ball girl. [all laugh] [RuPaul] Okay, first up, Shuga Cain and Jason. Your position will be head to butt using the blue ball. Assume the position. Yes, baby. My husband's gonna be mad as hell, but I can't help it. He's so beautiful. All right, go. Ball to the wall. [cheers] Put that ball in your face. [bell dings] [RuPaul] Disco ball ass to ass. Actually disco ball ass to ass is the name of my new album. [all laugh] Hip to hip with an 8 ball. Ooh, sounds like a Saturday night to me. [all laugh] Oh, yeah, teamwork. [Shuga] Yes, bitch, that's how you do it. Let him lead, honey. Oh![buzzer] And go. [bell dings] [buzzer] Ooh, look at that cute little chicken leg. [bell dings] That's fine, but they still move. They still move, baby. And go. -Balls to the wall. -Yes. Oh. [bell dings] [RuPaul] Well done. I'm determined and I know how to work these balls, baby. Wait, bitch, where we going? Hold on, Barry! [all laugh] Drop the thing. [bell dings] Yes! We got in there, baby. Come on, come on, hold my wig, hold my wig. Hold on, put it in the back. [bell dings] I might win something! [all laugh] Okay, ear to hip. Now, Silky, that's your ear to his hip. Oh, I got this. [all laugh] [Vanjie] What the heck? [bell dings] [cheers and applause] What the-- Yo, ladies, don't you wish gym class had been this much fun? [all laugh] Yes, ma'am. I wouldn't have quit. The queen that buried the most balls in the shortest amount of time is... Vanessa Vanjie Mateo. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Jesus. I won something. It's a Mini Challenge, but it's something. You've won a $2.500 gift card from Dirt Squirrel. Delta, Pit Crew, thank you so much for dropping by. We had a ball. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye, Delta. -Bye, Delta. Ladies, for this week's Maxi Challenge, you need to razzle-dazzle, mystify, and amaze, as you star in your very own magic show. [cheers and laughter] Now, you'll be performing in two teams. Now, Vanjie, you won the Mini Challenge, so you get to choose your magical sisters. So, Vanjie, who is your first choice. Big Silk with the alacazam milk. Yeah [all laugh] Come on, bitch. All right. Who's your second choice? A'Keria. And who is your third choice? I'm going to choose Yvie. All right, so you're going to play the race card. [all laugh] No. [RuPaul] That means Nina West, Shuga Cain, and Brooke Lynn Hytes, you are the competing team. All right. Now, in addition to performing professional illusions, you need to name your magic act, write captivating patter, and create a magical look using makeup provided by Anastasia Beverly Hills. [Nina] This is what I do. I produce and I write shows. Look out, David Copperfield, because I'm about to do the best reappearing act in this competition. Challenge agenda. Our main challenge this week is a drag magic show. I cannot wait. This is a great opportunity for us to really be cheesy. We have to essentially produce a show. It requires scripting. It requires producing. It requires learning a magic trick. So this a huge undertaking. -I think we can turn this out. -Absolutely. [Nina] After last week, I don't want to fade into the back. I want to be at the forefront. So let's figure out what our storyline is. Like, what's our relationship? Are we a sister act? Are we... like maybe we're like all left in an orphanage, and we're left to our own devices. And we grow up in the alleys of Vegas. I don't know. So my team is a team of over-thinkers. [laughs] I think we should be single ladies. I think we should be older. We're taking a long time to get where we need to be. Oh, my God, what if we're like three sorority sisters? -Like in that fall act. -Yeah. Our sorority is what? This is the one thing I was worried about. Because Nina loves to second-guess. Brooke loves to get in her feelings. And I already do that, so it's like the blind leading the blind today, girl. I don't know. [laughs] Like, some da-da-da-da-da. Um... "You will create a name for your magic troupe, the order of illusions, and who will perform which tricks." [Yvie] What are some of the individual illusions? Okay, so we have the appearing bra trick. The milk pitcher trick. The milk magically vanishes into to the newspaper. I kind of want to do the milk. Okay, so I can do the appearing bra trick. This is a whole lot of abracadabra, bitch. [all laugh] Let's create a magical name. We could make a joke about how we got all the ethnic girls. [laughs] The Dark Sided Magicians or something? Black Magic. I think it should be Da Black Magic, with D-A, and when something happens, say, Da Black Magic. [all laugh] [Yvie] But for real, though, do you guys think the other team is at all peeved with how things were split up? [Silky] If they upset, they're only upset because we are Team Personality. Like let's be honest about it. Damn, Vanjie, you put all the girls with the most talent, the most charm, the most character, and the most beauty, minus Yvie, on the same team. They destined to motherfucking fail, and I live for it. Hey, cysts. -Hi. -Hi, Ru. How are tricks? [all laugh] Business is good. Shazam, ladies. -Hi, Ru. -Hi. Hi. So you two have worked together before. Yes, we have. Actually quite a bit. Why do you think Vanjie didn't you put you on her team? Aren't you guys very close? She didn't want our romantic connection getting in the way of our work. Is there really a romantic connection? Yeah. We have a situation-ship. Have you slipped her the tongue? Several times. Really? Have you slipped her your pinky finger? [laughs] My God. You're making me blush, Ru. No pinky fingers. And you weren't shocked that you weren't chosen for Vanjie's team? [Brooke Lynn] This is a competition, and I don't expect anything like that. I don't expect to be chosen for her team just because... You're sticking her the pinky. [all laugh] I feel like a 12-year-old girl. [laughs] Now, do any of you have any experience in magic? -None. -Really? I can make my eyebrows disappear. Yes, you can. And that's the magic of drag right there. You know, I love drag because of the magical aspects. And how we, like Auntie Mame, can create an illusion out of some duct tape and paint and powder. And that's really what we want to see in this challenge, you know. Do you all have a narrative? -We have several. -We have several. Yeah. I think we're finally deciding to hone in on one, right? Yeah, we're trying to work on a couple--an idea. Now, you haven't won any challenges. Not yet. How are you going to make that happen? You know, I think I'm a little funny. I do funny sometimes. Yeah, no, that's why you're here. You've got it all. It's just how do you excel with all the other girls who have it all? Absolutely. The judges said that Silky overshadowed me in the last challenge. So for this week, I have to make sure that I'm going in as a wrecking ball. And if I feel like I'm doing enough, I need to do more. Hey, colored girl magic. -Hey. -Hey. I was surprised you didn't choose Brooke Lynn because apparently you two are an item. I'm not gonna put my man in my group. You know, get your own-- go on your side with, you know. When he had the chance to pick people, he picked Nina, and I wasn't pressed about it. He's doing good in this competition. I need to worry about myself. I'm thinking what's going to make me win and excel in this challenge? I'm thinking with this, not with this or this. Do any of you have experience with magic? You know, I made some men disappear in my day. [Vanjie] Right, right. I go from trucker to a woman in 25 minutes. Like that is true magic. Do you really see yourself as a trucker before you get into drag? [all laugh] I would like to know what scares you about this challenge. Probably what happened last week, which was just watching a train wreck happening, not being able to stop the train from wrecking. Yeah. You started at 10. There's nowhere to go from there. Planning out in advance is going to be something you need to do. [Vanjie] Right. I completely-- I want you to know that I am listening. I understand exactly what you're saying. [RuPaul] Well, listen, ladies, I cannot wait to see Da Black Magic. Let me get right back to writing. Let me get back to writing my script. All right. I have a lot to prove still. I just need to make sure when we slay this, that I'm like slam dunking this thing. You know, I need to go Michael Jordan on them. That's a straight reference for the people out there. Superbowl Sunday Beyoncé this. I need my moment. -Hi. -Hi. How's it going? [Shuga] It is time for us to learn some magic tricks, honey. My name is Kyle Marlett. I'm a magician and a magic creator from Las Vegas, and Ru invited me here to teach you guys some magic. You guys all ready for some magic? -Yes. -Yes. [all] Aah! All right. [cheers and applause] [Kyle] All right, let's get started doing some magic. What trick are you going to be doing? -I'm doing the swallowing sword. -Oh, boy. Now, this one is technically actually kind of dangerous. I'm going to show you first. What? [Shuga] Is he really doing this? -So you actually swallow that? -Mm-hmm. [muffled] It's in my throat. Girl. What? Hmm. So it's like... Mm. Now you try. Okay, so go ahead and put it in your mouth. And just kind of nom on it, basically. Oh, nothing has happened. Okay. [all laugh] I have tricks fail on me all the time. But it's important to hide that in your presentation. You cover up your mistakes with comedy. I'll just ask for the Pit Crew. Maybe I can try to swallow those instead. All right. We'll move on to the next person. Step up up. [laughs] I love it, I love it. Perfect. All right, the milk trick. It's very important that it's 2%. I'm kidding. That has nothing to do with it. [all laugh] So you can roll it up into a cone like so. And now you're going to take some milk. You're slowly going to pour it. Now you say the magic words. What are the magic words? -Mm, boom. -Right, right? Boom! -It's gone. -What? Oh! Oh, my goodness. -It's pretty cool, right? -You ready for me to try it? Yeah. It's actually really, really easy. -I'll tell you when. -Ooh. I don't know why you're moaning, but keep going. More. More, more. -Shit. -Okay. All right. [all laugh] Now, you know, at the end of the day, you got to let the trade know, you know-- oops--there's a little bit there still. Okay. And now you snap and say boom. Boom! Ain't shit there. [all laugh] Where the milk at, bitch? [Kyle] And what's your presentation during this? Your patter and everything. So, you know, uh, you know, the gentlemen like to skeet all over your-- They milk all over your-- your face and stuff. No more. Aim for the cone, and it will be gone. That's obviously for more of an adult audience, right? We gonna have children here? Work on your script, work on your presentation. [Shuga] What I'm noticing from Team Personality is that a lot of their stuff is really off-color. It's kind of filthy. The magic show is supposed to be PG-13, and right now, it's just reading kind of tasteless. So this one's a little tricky, but it's definitely fun. So I'll show you first, all right? -Okay. -Glass over here. Wine bottle here. Empty tube, right? Ready? One, two, and three. What? Okay, but how do you do that? All right, so you try it, and really fast. Boom. You did it. I'm a magician. I'm trying, I'm trying, Mary, I'm trying. Oh, no. No, that's not right. That's not what you're supposed to do. [all laugh] I'm really trying to get my trick down, and add these nuances of almost like this Chris Farley-esque magician. And what is your presentation for this? So won't we look prettier if we're all drunker. Shots all around. That's pretty good, right? I mean, that's pretty good. [Yvie] As we watch the other team, I'm like, fuck, they've got humor, they've obviously got rehearsed lines. It's definitely making me nervous for my team. [Kyle] All right, we'll move on to the next person. So hold this in your dominant hand. And take the lid, put it on top of the pan. Yep, all the way down. Do your magic wave, your presentation. -Shabam, alacazam. -Yeah. Oh! -Pretty good, right? -That is great. So this is a really, really easy one, right? So it's all presentation with this one. [Shuga] My magic trick, it's actually pretty easy. Thank the Lord, honey. So now I can just focus on putting on a show so that it looks like fantastic. Thank you. This is amazing. [snoring] Yes. [snoring] [laughs] So I'm going to show you with the playing cards, but you can use anything you want, all right? I will be honest. This is probably one of the hardest tricks that you could do. [Brooke Lynn] Good. So I'm glad you picked this one. So happy, too. What? [laughs] Where--wh-what? Take the card. [Brooke Lynn] What? Whew. Whooch. I'll let you try. So hold it between your fingers. Give it a spin. And--okay. I don't-- I've never seen this technique before. [all laugh] Don't be so awkward, okay? Just remember, you've got to use your presentation, you understand, right? I don't want you to be stressed out though. -I'm not. -I know magic's hard. I stress out about everything. Take the card, and let me know how that goes. -All right. -I hate this. [Shuga] Brooke is struggling. She hates it. She don't want to it. She can't get it. She is over this trick. And we have to be amazing, because we are up against Team Personality. [Nina] I feel really confident about what I'm doing, but there's no doubt in my mind that Brooke Lynn, after watching the other team and seeing gigantic personalities, I think she's in her head a little bit and saying how do I sell the trick? This could derail our whole team's goal of winning. This is like a do-or-die situation. I'm not going home after the challenge. [humming] Disappear, disappear, disappear. After learning our magic and watching the other team's production, it's quite clear that we need a hell of a lot more structure. Ugh. [Yvie] So we should start working on the format. I think yours is going to be the biggest segment where we're going to need to pad it up since A'Keria's going to have her mouth full. Like we should have some jokes prewritten so that we can just pop those out. [A'Keria] I think it should be one of those situations where it just comes straight off the head versus us writing it down now. Well, like, obviously we can talk and kiki, but like I think it needs to be a little organized. I think it should be like we casually talking, and it's just like, you know-- I think we just need like some transitions between our pieces. We have some people that want to improv and some people that want to write their parts down and I'm trying to people-please everybody. So I'm not saying we need to maybe make a specific. [Yvie] But like it goes wrong-- [Vanjie] We need to have something-- [Yvie] Stuff to lean back on. But everybody can just play off of each other, because we do have that chemistry. [Yvie] Silky and A'Keria want to improv their way through this whole challenge. I'm just kind of tired of fighting all of them. But in the back of my head, I still know we need some more structure. The only thing I think that does super need to be written down and rehearsed is the intro. Now let's go over this intro for sure. [Yvie] Okay. I'm going to write out these lines then. My group is a bunch of strong, opinionated girls, and I thought that was going to be the bonus. It might be the downfall. [cheering] Come on. Oh, Lord. [Vanjie] Today is elimination day, and we have to perform this magic show for the judges. I feel like somebody gonna disappear tonight. Bippity-boppity-bye. [Silky] Can I put my magic in you? Oh, you can put your magic in me any time, Silk. Wherever you want to put your magic. Brooke Lynn and Nina are definitely feeling better today. We practiced last night. It came together. Ah, it's gonna work. ♪ Whoo ♪ [A'Keria] I'm having a bad day. There's so much running through my head. I'm definitely still worried about my team. I'm just really like not in a good space right now. [Yvie] Hey, Miss A'Keria, how you feeling? I'm not in my spirit. Like I'm just--I don't know. [Yvie] Why not? What's the Tee? [A'Keria] I'm just not myself right now. Yeah, because you seem a little mellow for you today. Yeah. I'm just kind of like in my head. [Nina] I noticed A'Keria is really down. Like you can tell she's frustrated, and obviously it's regarding the challenge. Silk, how you guys feeling? [Silky] I'm not sure if I even know. We basically had to change our entire show last night. Why? Because our jokes were a little too dirty. We were too explicit. Rated R. [all laugh] [Yvie] We're just going to have to make sure that it's on in there for the cameras when it counts. [Nina] Yeah, that's true. Of course, the competition mind in me is like, okay, well, one of them's got a clipped wing, and it sounds like they're working on a completely new act. So A'Keria could be in trouble. [Silky] I got a question for you all. If we could use magic to change one thing in the world, what would it be? I think by taking away war, we could solve so many problems in the world. [Silky] Brooke Lynn, you're not competing for a Continental. Give us a real--[all laugh] How about if you could change something that's happened throughout this competition so far, what would it be? [Yvie] Ooh. [Shuga] I would have burned that troll outfit, girl. Yeah. You still should. [all laugh] Shady as hell. [Silky] What would you have changed, Vanjie? If I could go back in time, I would not pack 46 swimsuits. [all laugh] [giggles] [RuPaul laughs] ♪ Cover girl, put the bass in your walk ♪ ♪ Head to toe, let your whole body talk ♪ [applause] Welcome to the main stage of RuPaul's Drag Race. Michelle Visage, now, can you pull a rabbit out of a hat? No, but I can make a snake disappear. Several many snakes disappear, honey. [all laugh] The hilarious Ross Mathews. Now, do you know any tricks? Ru, watch this, ready? [blows] [laughs] And the lovely Katherine Langford. How you doing? I'm good. Glad to be here. Are you from Australia? Whereabouts? I am. I'm from Perth. Ah, you got Perth-onality, do ya? [all laugh] You bet. I'll meet you down at Cottesloe. Be there. See ya, mate. [laughs] [RuPaul] Good on ya, mate. Hilly dilly. And Gina Rodriguez. Now, are you a Drag Race virgin? My legs are not crossed under this table. [laughs] Prove it. Rrrrrrr. So excited you're here. It's great to be here, Ru. This week, we challenged our queens to put on a drag-tastic magic show. And tonight on the runway, category is Caftan Realness. Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win. [cheers and applause] [RuPaul] Let the magic show begin. [Gina] Yes. [laughs] Ladies and gentlemen... Boys and girls. I am Shuga Shablam Alacazam. And I'm Bubbly Brooke. [all laugh] Girl, where is Nina? Football practice? [all laugh] I'm checking her dressing room. Open sesame. Girl, she is not even fucking in here. Well, like they say in show business... -Fuck her. -No, Mary. Magic waits for no queen. -We're titillating. -We're tantalizing. We're dudes. [laughter and applause] Better late than pregnant, I always say. I'm Naughty Nina, and our journey begins five years ago, where three young ladies had blue eye shadow, duct tape, and a dream of...[whispers] magic. [all laugh] Now, there are a few rules at every drag show. So rule number one: the more you drink, the prettier we look. But, Shuga, this is a drag magic show, so I actually think the first rule is the more we drink, the better they look. Touché. Which leads us to our first trick, ladies and gentlemen. Bippity, boppity, glug-glug-glug-glug, booze. We take a bottle of Merlot and a shot glass. All I want to do is replace the bottle with the shot glass, the shot glass with the bottle. We all on the same page? Great. [all laugh] I cover the bottle with this lovely empty canister. You can shove your fist in it, too. It's been lubed with Crisco. Then we take this other empty cani-- I'll save this one for after the show. We cover our shot glass. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna need your help here, okay? When I count to three, I need you to say that magical word that's going to make it all happen: tucktastic. One, two, three. [all] Tucktastic. Aah! Wow. [cheers and applause] Magic! [all laugh] Shall we do it again? Do you dare me to do it again? We will do it again, ladies and gentlemen. One, two, three. Tucktastic! Oh. I think there's an alcoholic in our midst, and it's me. But looks like I have a bottle for Ross... a bottle for Michelle... a bottle for Mama Ru... a bottle for Gina... a bottle for Katherine... a bottle for Brooke... a bottle for Shuga... and a shot for me, ladies and gentlemen. That is bippity, boppity, boo. [cheers and applause] Rule number two is cleanliness is close to goddessness. Now, if only there was a queen who had some dirty, raunchy tights around. [all laugh] Ooh, pee-eew. How long's it been since you've washed your tights? September...2015. [all laugh] [grunting] Aah! Whew. Those are fragrant. Now I know what Vanjie feels like. [all laugh] These definitely need some magic detergent. Ooh, shablam. -Ooh. -So does this, girl. Shuga Slablam. Alacazam. Fresh tuck panties. [cheers and applause] [whispers] Magic. [all laugh] That brings us to Rule three: illusion is everything. Now, me and these bubbles have a lot in common. You see, these bubbles dance. They are light and flowy like air. [whispers] Magic. We both move with the power of a thousand seas. [all laugh] [whispers] Magic. The thing we have the most in common is my tuck. [whispers] Magic. You see, they're soft to look at, but hard to the touch. [applause] Ladies and gentlemen, no stunt has been pulled on the Drag Race stage like this since Valentina said "I'd like to keep it on, please." [all laugh] Now, Brooke Lynn Hytes doesn't know this, but she's going to step ever so gently into this big wooden box. What? -Go ahead, baby. -What's happening? -Don't worry about it. -Oh, don't worry, sweetheart. What--what--what? Oh, I feel very uncomfortable. Saturday night for me. Get in the box. I feel very attacked right now! [all laugh] Also, Shug, this is a great way to get it down to a final six. Amen. Eliminate the competition. Oh, thank you, dear. I haven't been on top in a while. We know. [all laugh] -One. -One. -Two. -Two. Three! [cheers and applause] Magic! It's a heavy flow day. Halleloo, I'm back, bitches. Ladies and gentlemen, you've just witnessed the reverse Shangela! [all laugh] [Shuga] I'm a little brown woman in a big brown box. Oh! [all laugh] Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Halleloo times two. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Bubbly Brooke. I'm Naughty Nina. And I'm Shuga Shablam Alacazam. And together we are... [all] The Mighty Tucks! [cheers and applause] [all] Magic. Magic... Magic... Magic. And the tricks just keep on coming. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Thank you all for coming. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and squirrels, I welcome you to our dark mystical world. Deeper than my tuck, but hotter as hell. It's even worse than a cold blank stare from Michelle. [laughs] Straight from the light and all that is tragic, and you'll find my sisters. We are Da Black Magic. The Black Magic. Ooh, Da Black Magic. Da Black Magic. [Yvie] Da Black Magic. Da Black Magic. -Oh, Da Black Magic. -Mm-hmm. Da Black Magic. [cheers and applause] I am Yvie the Oddball. I'm Big Silk Boom. And I'm Vanishing Vanjie. All right, now let's get this--wait. One, two, three. Where's Miss Thing? -She-- -Can we go get her? She better not be gone. Bippity bop and titties that flop. Look out, girl, it's Azakazam A'Keria. -Yeah. -Oh, girl. And together, we are... [all] Da Black Magic. [cheers and applause] We are the world's first troupe of magicians who travel from barbeque to barbeque. It's a little cold in here, baby. I'm feeling the breeze. That's 'cause you don't have a bra, a panties, anything. How indecent-- When do I ever? True. This is a children's function, though. And where there are kids, there are baby daddies, which means I can find the Adam for my Yvie. But I know it's not easy to tie the knot. Look, I did it. I did-- That's a real knot, y'all. [all laugh] Come on. Ooh, now let's see if I can whip up a bra for my baby over here. Ooh...oh... Bippity, boppity, bra. [cheers and applause] Look at this cute over-the-shoulder boulder holder. She'll hold some jugs. Did someone say jugs? Jugs of milk...shake? [all laugh] My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard. And so I gotta get that to the barbeque as soon as possible, honey, so I got to teleport it with this sheet of paper. Ooh, baby. Ahh, baby. Roll it up, baby. Wind it, baby. -Wind it. -Ooh. And now we pour. Oh. [A'Keria] Oh, girl. No drop left behind, baby. [Vanjie] I've never seen you this concentrated. Mm. -Oh, girl. -She's feeling her Elsie. [Yvie] Oh, it's still going. Oh, how much can you fill? Now let's feel if she's dry. I feel a little thirsty. -Thank you, sis. -I got you, girl. I got you, girl. All right, fee fi fo fum. Look out, throat, here it comes. Oh, where'd it go, baby? That's some good shit right there. Oh, I know there's going to be a lot of boys at this barbeque, honey. Speaking of the barbeque, if this bitch don't have condiments at this barbeque, I'm gonna beat her ass, because I had to have a dry hot dog last time. Girl, y'all won't believe what just happened to me -at the grocery store. -Tell 'em, boo. I went in there trying to get the condiments for the barbeque. The lady said, ma'am, whatever you have in that bag, you didn't pay for. I said, what are you talking about? She said, open up the bag, show me the ketchup. I said, what are you talking about, this? She said, yeah, that. You didn't pay for it. I said, ain't nothing-- no ketchup in here, baby. I had to get it together, and I said, look, what's in the bag, Christine? What's in the bag? I know you gagging. I can see you. And I said I don't got ketchup in the bag. I got mustard in the bag. Okay, I see y'all are gagged. Ain't nothing in the bag. She said, well, flip it to the other hand, Mary, if you think you so cute. I said, okay, ain't nothing in the bag still. You know what? I'm about to show you what's really in the bag. Da Black Magic, mama. Ain't nothing in the bag. Ain't no ketchup. Ain't nothing. Now, A'Keria, what you bringing to this barbeque? Oh, girl, you know, I got to bring to this barbeque my old trick. I'm gonna show you why I am the most popular girl at the barbeque. Just gonna pump this right on up. All right, just like that. 'Tis a jiggle, and hip that do, too. Watch out, y'all, I'm gonna take this down to the zoo. [Yvie] Oh, girl. Oh, my. Ooh. -How's she doing that? -I don't know. [Michelle] She must be popular. Oh, you're almost there, girl. Just the tip. Just the tip. Girl. [applause] You know, it also works for a low cal diet. [Vanjie] Girl, after watching that, y'all know I got a little bit of the itis, 'cause that means you done ate a lot of food, and you're getting a little sleepy. Well, I just got a lot of gas. Well, lucky for you, I know the oldest trick in the Black Magic book. Okay, girl, you're gonna need to lay yourself on this magic table so that we can get you some rest that's light as a feather, but stiff as a board. Magic table? Let's wrap her up tight so she gets that good sleep. Mm-hmm. What's the Tee, Christine? What's the Tee, Christine? What's the--? Yeah, still works. Oh, oh, I feel Da Black Magic in me. Girl, I think it's time. Oh! -All right. -Keep pulling on out, girl. Oh! [cheers and applause] [Michelle] Wow. It's Da Black Magic. [cheers and applause] But wait. We're gonna be late for our next barbeque. We'd better fix this table and wake her up. Oh, girl. Oh. Girl, I need my plate. Time to wake Miss Vanjie. [all] Miss Vanjie. Miss Vanjie. Miss Vanjie. Da Black Magic! [cheers and applause] Girl, come on, we gotta get to the next barbeque. [Shuga] This really Da Loud Magic. [cheers and applause] We are Da Black Magic. [cheers and applause] ♪ We got a mighty love ♪ Category is Caftan Realness. First up, the Dr. Reverend Silky Nutmeg Ganache. Why y'all gagging so? She bringing to you every ball. [all laugh] [Silky] Bitch, I am the Tee, and I know I am the Tee in this caftan. Big old balls on my head. Now, that's a magic trick, 'cause I know all of you wondering how I got them to stick on my head. Alacazam, that's all you need to know, ho. [Ross] She's going ball. [all laugh] [RuPaul] This is the mahogany fantasy, darling. I'm a winner, baby. Yvie Oddly. Holy caftan. [Katherine] Hello, Your Holiness. [all laugh] [Yvie] Because it's a fabulous caftan challenge, I want to serve 100% enlightened monk realness. Just gliding down the runway spreading peace. It's got this train that sweeps the runway behind me. [Michelle] Crochet! [all laugh] -What? Ow. -Ooh. [RuPaul] My goodness. [Ross] She deserves a pat on the back. -She certainly does. -From herself. [all laugh] [RuPaul] A'Keria C. Davenport. That bitch is fly. [Michelle] Yes, honey. Fly, fly, fly, fly. [A'Keria] So, baby, mama is feeling so fierce on this stage. My caftan is a pantsuit with butterfly wings. The fabric is flowing, and I just feel like I am going to take flight at any moment. [Ross] You butta fly. [RuPaul] She just came out of her cocoon. What did I just call me? What did I just call me? [all laugh] [RuPaul] Vanessa Vanjie Mateo. Ooh. [Michelle] From the Jackie Stallone collection. [RuPaul] Yes. [Vanjie] I'm extra, extra, caftan all about it. Cheetah print head to toe. I'm a white lady on vacation. I put that turban on just in case a little splash of water, bitch. I made sure my little baby hairs are laid down. I'm looking like when those bitches go on a vacation, and they put all their shit on. [Ross] If you like it, then you better put a nose ring on it. [all laugh] [RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes. [Gina] That's a plum choice. [RuPaul] It certainly is. Ooh. [Brooke Lynn] I'm giving you fucking sexy caftan realness. It's like a little bit Studio 54, a little bit Sarah Jessica Parker in Abu Dhabi in Sex and the City 2, a little bit Wonder Woman. I'm just shaking that chiffon behind me, and then I just throw it. Yes. [RuPaul] Oh, yes, honey. Sell the garment. [Michelle] Eat it, Barney. [RuPaul] Ooh, purple rain, purple train. [all laugh] [RuPaul] Shuga Cain. [Michelle] Anna Karenina no she betta don't. [RuPaul] Oh, meet you in Gorky Park. [Michelle laughs] [Shuga] I am giving you magic on this runway. I'm feeling luxurious in my faux fur. I'm ready to cuddle up by the fire in this gorgeous caftan. And voila, it is spring, honey. I am feeling my fruit fantasy. She is blossoming all over this runway. I'm showing you all the legs, the sun's out. I'm ready to catch these boys, honey. -Oh. -Ooh. [Michelle] Beach blanket bang-a-ho. [RuPaul] Shuga Cain, now de-caftan-ated. [all laugh] [RuPaul] Nina West. Welcome to Caftanistan. [all laugh] [Ross] Bea Arthur? More like A+ Arthur. -Yes. -Yes. [Nina] I'm really trying to sell the luxury of this lifestyle in my elegant Elizabeth Taylor seventies caftan. I'm feeling loose and free, and I can feel the wind go up my ass, which is amazing. I haven't felt that in weeks. This woman is a woman of means, and she's getting ready for a busy day of sitting. [Michelle] Lady Bunny never looked so good. [RuPaul] Mm. See you later at the Regal Beagle. [all laugh] [Michelle] Yes, Mrs. Groper. [all laugh] All of those references were too old for everybody in this room. [RuPaul] Well, you're educating children. Ladies, welcome to Caftanistan. [all laugh] And now it's time for the judges' critiques. Starting with the Dr. Reverend Silky Nutmeg Ganache. When you came out, it was such a statement, and I think it made all of us kind of gasp a little bit. The eyelashes are crazy to me. It looks like they're just in the middle. So like if you're looking one way, it looks like you're not even wearing a lash. You were great in the magic show. You made me laugh over and over. The spins were giving me life. Your connection to the audience and to everyone was really, really epic. Your personality was in it, and that's what we eat up. But it seemed messy. Your jacket looked wrinkly. Your padding, you could see the outlines of your hip pads. Like, girl, we saw everything. I recognize that I had body issues in my padding. Like, I had people trying to help me push them down and reshape them. And my body just did not work today. Well, let me just stop you there. I mean, there are things you could have done. Mm-hmm. Throw on more tights so it smooths it out. At this point in the competition, we're splitting hairs. And these are the kinds of things that could get a girl put into the bottom two. Up next, Yvie Oddly. Tonight on the runway, I absolutely love this. Givenchy. Very chic. [Michelle] Your performance was kind of flat. There was a tenseness, you know, at times. Even though it sort of came across that you were a little nervous, you had really bold choices. From an actor's perspective, that's essential in a performance. But it seemed to me like you were thinking or like you weren't enjoying yourself. I guess I was a little bit stressed because like we had to rewrite a lot of stuff. And in the kindest of ways to the rest of my team, I'm the only one who thinks that way. Thinks what way? Uh, in planning things out. My team was basically like, well, we work better with improv, and it was very obvious that it didn't work being improv-ed. So I wrote most of our intro, our exit. If there was a place I was at, it was just, I guess, just trying to make sure that all went right. All right. Thank you, Yvie. Um, Mama, I did not do improv. So I didn't write down what I was going to say? I'm not saying you didn't write down what you were going to say. You said the rest of us didn't. You guys didn't plan as much as I did, girl. -That's the Tee. -I did plan. I'm not gonna go through that. [Vanjie] I'm like, girl, how you gonna sit there and say that to the judges knowing that's the particular critique that has been given to me? [RuPaul] Up next, A'Keria C. Davenport. I live in Palm Springs, so I take caftans very seriously. Okay. [Ross] I love this outfit, but a caftan it is not. I'm sorry to get mad about it. [all laugh] Now wait. In my defense, I Googled caftan. Now, there's a caftan with a C and a kaftan with a K. And I saw some caftans with pants. Not in my religion. [all laugh] Your magic show was great. The only thing I would have wanted to see more of was when you did your trick. The way that all four of you were around, I would have loved to have seen more hype from your teammates, because I think that would have helped sell the moment more. [Ross] Your team struggled a little bit. I was having a bad day at first, because there was a lot going on, but... What was going on? Going into it, we all had the mindset of the, you know, improv. At the last minute, some of the decisions and the routes we went wasn't going to be suitable for television. [laughs] So at the last minute, we did have to rearrange some things. You cleaned up the magic act, and the deep throat balloon stayed in? [all laugh] Was it--how dirty was it? Oh, girl, it was filthy. [all laugh] But tasty, too. Up next, Vanjie. First and foremost, I want to say this is my favorite caftan up here tonight. -Aw. -I would wear that caftan. Yeah, you look my titi Sepha, my titi-- Girl, I was already thinking we look family, mama. Don't do it to me. [all laugh] It's to die for. The challenge, though. I didn't really get much from the performance, and when you did talk, I was like there's Vanjie. Wait. Right. There's no character development. Okay, yeah. I feel like we hit a wall. I did write down what I wanted to say and what I was going to do. Like I've been trying really hard to push myself. Like whatever critiques you guys say, I do listen. And, um, that's why I went a different route with just writing it down and stuff. That's not the problem. There's gotta be some kind of elevation in performance. It's just at this level. You need to give us more or else it's done. Thank you, Vanjie. Up next, Brooke Lynn Hytes. Let's talk about this runway look. I love it so much. I wish I had a gold bra. [all laugh] I was really captivated by the way that you walked. Whipping it around, leg out, pose, turn. It was delicious. And that magic show was phenomenal. Really, really funny. [Michelle] They were realized characters, you had choreography, which I'm attributing to you. I laughed the entire time. [ Katherine] And one of my notes I wrote for you was, baby, you're a star. Oh. [RuPaul] Up next, Shuga Cain. You look absolutely beautiful in this. It's Game of Thrones. Like, it's just giving me queen everything. I wish you would have kept this on. I felt like it got progressively not as cute. In the magician's production, you weren't bad, but you paled in comparison next to two juggernauts. It was not quite good enough. [Ru] There was a point where you had a few jokes to land, but you never quite landed those jokes. You guys did a better job than the other team. You always want to be on the best team, but the risk is being overshadowed. [RuPaul] Up next, Nina West. Tonight on the runway, it's exactly the caftan that I've been dreaming of my entire life. I really enjoyed your performance in The Mighty Tucks. Magic! The eighties shoulder pads, the life was everything. Obviously Brooke Lynn's a dancer, and you're back there cheesing it up just as much as she is. I was dying of laughter. You were, from the beginning to the end, hysterical. [Katherine] Your energy was so up, and your command of the stage and what you were doing was great to watch. [Ross] It was so funny. And you created this other character. That's how you do it. Thumbs up to you. [all laugh] [RuPaul] Thank you, ladies. I think we've heard enough. While you untuck backstage, the judges and I will deliberate. All right, now, just between us squirrel friends, I wanna know what you have to say about my girls. Silky Nutmeg Ganache. She really kept the energy high, and her personality definitely shone through. She was counting on her charm. Now, I bought it, but I couldn't get over looking at how sloppy she looked. It really was messy. It just didn't work for me. You gotta come strong all the time. [RuPaul] Yvie Oddly. [Katherine] Yvie seemed a little nervous to me on stage tonight for the magic show. I felt like she was just thinking about the words, getting it done, and then moving to the side of the stage. If she was the one that wrote something to open and close, then she could have been the only saving grace in that performance. Didn't look like the other girls thought it was true, though. Did you see Vanjie? She was not having that. [Gina] Well, yeah, there was disconnect definitely in that group, and you felt it in the performance. [RuPaul] A'Keria C. Davenport. The team had a bit of a tough time cohesively putting that performance together, but I'd really like to see more of her. Tonight on the runway, it's a caftan challenge, and there's nary a caftan to be found. You know, some of these caftans were so good they were making me pant. Like...[pants] But A'Keria was making me...pant? [laughs] I don't know if I've ever been this mad in my entire life. [all laugh] Caftan it was not. Let it go, Ru. [all laugh] [RuPaul] Vanessa Vanjie Mateo. This has been week after week after week where we're trying to get character development, and we're not. [Katherine] Her personality is definitely something that is really magnetic. [Ross] I just find her so interesting and so funny. But I don't disagree that at a certain point you've gotta bring more than just one gear. [RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes. She's been great in this competition. I feel very attacked right now! And nobody owned the runway like she did tonight. The dance background she has has really come in handy. [Gina] Brooke Lynn is a star. Not just kind of, sort of. She is a star. [RuPaul] Shuga Cain. Shuga gave me comedy blue balls. You know, when it came time for her punchline, I was right there ready for it. So does this, girl. It just didn't happen. On the runway, she went from pretty to worse to, no, girl, stop. She was the least favorite of that group, and the runway as well. In this competition, she's not really hit her mark yet. Nina West. For me, she was a real standout tonight. It was literally a sketch from Saturday Night Live. It was that good, you guys. We know. I just want to cast her in the lead of a TV show immediately. She slammed the performance out of the park. Grand slam, bring everybody home. Nina West at the plate. That was a sport reference. Silence. I've made my decision. Bring back my girls. [RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies. I've made some decisions. Brooke Lynn Hytes. Poof, you're safe. Thank you very much. Nina West, abracadabra, I want to reach out and grab ya. Con-drag-ulations. You're the winner of this week's challenge. [gasps] Well, thank you very much. You've won a $3.000 gift card from Marek & Richard, and a $3.000 gift card Thank you. Thank you. Holy shit. Holy shit. I just won my second challenge. This is insane. Shuga Cain, in the magic act, the judges thought you disappeared. I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination. Aah! I cannot believe I'm in the bottom two. I ain't gonna lie. I am mad as hell. To me, this makes absolutely no sense. [RuPaul] A'Keria C. Davenport, you're safe. Thank you so much. Yvie Oddly. You're safe. Thank you. [RuPaul] Silky Nutmeg Ganache. You milked it in the challenge, but your look didn't do a body good. Vanessa Vanjie Mateo. Your caftan was spicy, but your magic act didn't cut the mustard. Silky Nutmeg Ganache, you're safe. You may join the other girls. Miss Vanjie, I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination. Two queens stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself... from elimination. The time has come... [thunder] for you to lip sync... [echoing] for your life! [Vanjie] I'm sorry, Shuga, but, baby, it's gonna be a fight. I ain't leaving. Good luck, and don't fuck it up.
