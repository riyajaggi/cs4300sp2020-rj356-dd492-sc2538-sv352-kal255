 Nobody touch him. I'm going to take care of this myself. Get out! I'm going to cut you into 100 little pieces. Shut it. Let's get this over with. It's amazing that you've lasted this long. I underestimated your desire for Mariko. I have to give credit where it's due. Screw you and your credit! I came here for your daughter, not to get a gold star. You see what happens to people who try to cross me? Logan! I said let go! Right now! My, my, my. You've been feistier since he got here.

 Whimper all you want. I'm not letting you go, you're worth far too much. So much, in fact, I have a bit of insurance. What's that? I'm sure your father can handle Logan... ...but it always pays to be prepared. What the hell was that? Logan! -Mariko! -Logan! I told you I'd find you. Yes. Shut up. Logan, show yourself! Ready or not, here I come! This is between him and me.

 -But-- -Don't make me repeat myself, Hideki. Yes, sir. Even your recovery capacity couldn't handle such a big blow. It'll be a while before you're healed. No need to worry about me. Those were your final words. Shingen! Yukio! Look out! Yukio! It's okay. I got him. That's all that matters. I don't think so. Challenging me comes at a very high price. No. I've had enough! Playtime's over! This time, you die! Kikyo! This battle is their own. Do not interrupt them. There's no way to suck that poison out! Since when have you been here? You will pay for this transgression. But let's talk about this later. We have to see the battle. Shit. -What? -It's a pity. I prepared for you. Your nails cannot cut this body armor of vibranium and steel. Logan! You're pathetic. Even with your mutant powers, you don't stand a chance against me. I'll admit, you're pretty good with a sword, and you may have a black belt... ...but every time you talk, I realize you're just a little bitch. Such language. Seems it's my place to teach you some respect. -Where do you think you're going? -Mind your own business. There's honor in accepting help. I will survive. I know we'll make it through this. When all of this is over, we'll rule over the entire underworld. And to do it... ...I'll need all of your father's underworld connections. Not to mention the laundered cash he'll bring in. You and I will make an empire. Kurohagi and Yashida united at last. And soon, anyone who wants to stop us will be dead. Tired yet? All my preparation has paid off. I will take your head. You really like to flatter yourself, don't you? You still have no idea who you're dealing with. This is where it all gets decided. For one of these men, it's the end. That body armor gives him the upper hand. Every blow rips his flesh to pieces. Even when you consider Logan's healing power... ...he must be feeling intense pain. Welcome to our honeymoon suite. It's not the romantic getaway I had in mind, but it will have to do. Say, would you like to meet my father? Because he's right behind you. It was poison that killed him. I gave it to him. You murdered your own father? What's wrong with you? Nothing. It was kill or be killed. He wanted to do everything his way. I could have never been the emperor if he had stayed alive. Always telling me I wasn't man enough. He was a feeble, worthless bastard, who didn't give a damn about his only son. The sort of man who would use his daughter's wedding as a bargaining tool. So I killed him before he would kill me. I will make... ...new history. My own history. -Logan. -Don't. You'll do more harm than good if you try. You should trust him. This is the true difference of competence. Now I will claim my prize. Your head! -You bastard. -You've got a debt to pay. It's long overdue! Yukio! Make your parents proud! -Logan. -You did it! -Thank you. Your.... -Shut up. Don't say it. Now it's time. I have a confession to make, Logan. -I did something wrong. -A confession? Your friend, Asano. I was the one who stabbed him that night. I left him for dead. I was so consumed with hatred for Shingen for murdering my parents. I needed you to get my revenge... ...but I knew you'd never help me if you were working with Asano. Without you I never would have stood a chance back here. I used you. I'm ashamed of what I've done to you. I'm so sorry and I know you can't forgive me. Yukio. I get it. Logan. You are the best man I've ever known. Goodbye. Yukio. Kurohagi left the palace with Mariko. -To the catacombs. -Catacombs? What are you planning? Tell me right now! -Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise. -Answer me! Okay. I have to tell my wife everything. See this? It's a control panel for explosives wired throughout the palace. But don't you worry. We're terribly safe down here. This room's completely sealed. And we can escape to a safe place. Of course, everyone else above us... ...will be blown to pieces when the palace detonates. I am sorry. No, no, no. You mustn't touch that. You'll ruin the fun. We have to wait for the countdown to finish. Why are you helping me? I am not helping you. -Then what? -You know. To fight with you. But before that... ...we have to clean up the mess. Silly! Let them all die. I shall take my first step into this land... ...where everything has been destroyed. -I just need you by my side. -You're evil! That's enough, my love. You're much prettier when you don't open your mouth. We gotta be close now! Over here? Never easy with this guy, is it? Go now! This is your one chance! I think I can hold it just long enough! -Kikyo! -One! Two! Three! -Mariko! -Logan! Damn, you'll follow a guy to the end of the Earth! -Let go of her, now! -Shut up! You're in no position to tell me what to do! I'm in control! Not so cool when you have a gun pointed at you? You're a joke! -No, Logan! -Hush now, sweetie. Know your place. A good wife is a quiet wife. Pull the trigger. -Guess you're done there, slick. -Logan! Even taking into account your healing factor... ...there's no way you're getting out of this. One in the head should do it. Logan, forgive me. Because of me.... You don't look well. Let me help you. Now, now. Step aside, sweetheart, there's no way you can save him. Then so be it. But you won't touch him. -You'll have to kill me first. -You whore! Oh, no.... My.... My.... We're finally free now. I'm so sorry, Logan. Mariko! -But I will always be with you. -Don't worry. -Stay with me. Please, you can't! Mariko! -Logan. Stay with me. I cannot lose you. Don't go. Don't cry, my dear Logan. I was saved. You saved me from hell. Goodbye, Logan. I love you. Mariko. I tried everything I could to save you. I fought and I fought... ...and it wasn't enough. I have to find a way to go on without you. If I give up, I'd only be letting you down. You sure? Indeed. It's our destiny. -Destiny? -Yes. All right, then.
