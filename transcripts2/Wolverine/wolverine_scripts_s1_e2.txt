Father, stop this! Please! Come, my lady. Very good, sir, you've beaten him, now finish him off. I cannot, thanks to your interference. You fool. This fight was to be single combat. Man-to-man. He's yours now. Do with him what you will.

 It will be a pleasure, sir. We've got movement. Logan! What the...? Where the hell are those idiots taking him? Kurohagi, what will happen to him? He'll be sent back to America. I will accompany him to the airport. Poor dear, you need rest. Finally, you will see only me. You will have no choice. They're leaving the compound. I'll follow them. Just keep me updated on their coordinates. You stay here and maintain surveillance on the old man. But....

 We can't take our eyes off Shingen for even a minute. I'm the one who got Logan into this mess. I've got to get him out. Mr. Asano.... If anything happens to me, it's up to you to take the Kuzuryu down. Make sure you nail them. Sir.... You let Agent Asano go without backup? Is he crazy? What is he trying to do, get himself killed? It's quiet here tonight. We're going after him. What? Poor guy goes on a binge and picks the wrong place to sleep it off. Logan! Logan! Logan! Logan! Logan! Logan! It's only you. -Mr. Asano. -Are you okay? What happened to Logan? -I don't know. -What? He just disappeared. -Disappeared. -Yeah. Yeah, he.... Wait, what the hell are you two doing here? Maybe we should save that for later. They're Kuzuryu, aren't they? Both killed by swords. The guys who brought Logan here. So it would seem. But what went down here? I don't know. It must be Shingen. I cannot imagine there is another man who has his skill. -All right. I notified headquarters. -Good. In any case, they intended to kill Logan. Should we get a warrant and go to the Kuzuryu? No. We won't be able to catch him anyway. And we cannot reach Shingen.... But who attacked me and the Kuzuryu? Damn you, Logan, you're going to be the death of me. What the...? Father. I am obeying your wishes. Please do not harm Logan. You needn't concern yourself with him any longer. It's Logan.... He got away! Mariko! Come now, is that any way to treat someone who just saved your life? You and that famous healing factor.... No normal human should have survived... ...Shingen's sword, even if it was only wooden, not to mention the injection. But then you're not exactly human, are you? Don't worry, I'm open-minded. And just who are you? Well, I'm not your enemy. You want to save her, right? Mariko Yashida? I can help you. Her father did this. Shingen. Shingen. Yes, I know him.... He killed my mother. My mother worked for him. She was one of his best assassins. Her mission was to kill Kuzuryu enemies. But one time, she failed. Just once.... But once was enough. Shingen has a low tolerance for failure. So, you see... ...I never forgave Shingen. You looking for this? Don't worry, I didn't crack the password. Logan. Logan. Computer, I need an address for Agent Asano. Do you know how to find this place? -Doesn't seem to be home. -Hold on. What's wrong? I smell blood. Asano? What's wrong?! Asano! Asano! The blade went straight through his heart, he must have died instantly. Police! Freeze, scum! We received a report that Mr. Asano was murdered. I'm just guessing here, but I think we've been set up. -Don't move! -You've got the wrong guy. Don't suppose you'll take my word for it though, will you? First the cops, now the goon squad. This time, the gloves are coming off! Kind of makes you wonder how everyone knew we were here! I'm guessing this surprise party was set up by the Kuzuryu. Well, well. Wolverine. And in peak fighting form from the looks of things. It's Kikyo Mikage, one of Shingen's deadliest assassins. What? Just you and me. I never imagined there would be someone like me in Japan. Can you beat Kikyo? --all that will be left is the wedding. It was you! You killed Asano! I will definitely find out... ...which of us is stronger. Next time on Wolverine: Kikyo.
