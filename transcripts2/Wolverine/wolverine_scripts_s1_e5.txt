 You're dead. Logan, move it! Finally, it is time for you to die. Rest in pieces. Logan. This is nothing compared to the suffering I went through. This is the end. I'll tear you apart. I think you're disturbing the peace. All of this is your fault. You're still going at it? Ticktock, Logan. Nobody's gonna win this one.

 Let's just call it a day, huh? -Shut up! -Fine then. Wolverine! Well, I guess this wasn't a complete waste of my time. If you're trying to reach Shingen, don't bother. What? He's long gone. And he took his daughter with him. Mariko. It seems that Omega Red and Wolverine fought at Shinjuku 7-chome. Witness reports indicate that Omega Red and an unidentified person were killed. Wolverine is still at large. Logan did it again. Anyway, we have proof that Shingen and his men are smuggling narcotics...

 ...and we've got a warrant. -Kuzuryu will be no more. -Yeah. Get back. What is that? Wolverine. Mariko! Where are you? Mariko! We're too late. It seems like that guy was right. I don't see any sign of Shingen or of Mariko. What is it? I've been waiting for you. Well, well. Kikyo. He can't handle much more of this treatment. This new regulator device has not yet been refined. It's only temporary. It doesn't last too long. Well, we'll try to get him up and running... ...just so that he can kill Wolverine. Yeah, we have many other replacements. Those you seek to find are not here. No kidding. Where are they? That is irrelevant. Because today you die. That's really funny, considering what happened last time. I've got a question for you. Go on. Were you responsible for what happened to Agent Asano? Agent? What are you talking about? You don't know. The healing factor comes in handy, doesn't it? So, what's your story? Even I am not entirely sure of my origins. My only wish is to fight you. -Arrest every one of them! -Yes! -Find Shingen! -Yes, sir! Logan. You are good. This is fun. I'm so glad I have a fan. I just received some bad news from HQ. Shingen was spotted at the airport boarding his private jet. By all accounts, he's already on his way to Madripoor. I should've known. And we don't have jurisdiction there. What the hell are we gonna do now? Takagi. Thank you. They've just completed Asano's autopsy. The results are in. Yeah. There's no doubt it was the stab wound that killed him. But they found something interesting between his teeth. Well, what is it? What did they find? Bizarre. A strand of hair. It has to belong to the assailant. It must have lodged itself there during the scuffle. It's Logan, isn't it? Can they confirm? Logan is not a match? Yes, send us a full report right away. {\an8}Logan and Asano were friends for a long time. {\an8}Do you think he's seeking revenge? Yeah, why not? He'd want to get even. You love your little tricks, don't you? Wolverine. I've come to kill you. Nobody gets in the way of Omega Red. Back off. Wolverine is my enemy. I won't let you kill him. This is our battle. Do not interfere. I'm telling you to back off. Even if we fight against each other... ...Shingen and A.I.M. are the only ones who benefit in the end. Don't waste the life that they gave you once again. I won't regret losing my life if I kill you. I have no interest. Wolverine. Prepare to die. -You don't look so good. -Shut up. I seriously hope that's the last of him. I'm pretty sure he's dead this time. Sorry for the wait. You've been itching for a fight, so let's finish this once and for all. I'm ready and waiting. No, we will test our skills another time. There's no honor in fighting an exhausted opponent. It's not my style. Style, huh? He's here. There she is, Madripoor. I thought you two were friends. Not your first time here, I'm guessing. I lived here. Logan is here? Wolverine. What a pleasant surprise. Sorry, but Japan's not exactly on my way home. Wait. I bet I know why you're looking for him. So where do I find him? {\an8}Next time on Wolverine: "Min."
