 Hey, you! Don't you have something to say to me? I still haven't achieved my objective. Min! He'll never learn. I have to kill him. Don't think you can just run off without me. -I'll go too. -I'll tag along. I know it's crazy, but I can't miss this opportunity to fight you. Yeah, yeah, pretty boy, don't worry. Do you want to fight now? No, not under these circumstances. We won't be able to focus on our fight. Let's fight after you've rescued your precious damsel.

 Thank you for your consideration. Sorry to keep you all waiting. The bride will be ready soon. Logan's outside and Koh's with him. Koh's here? Don't worry, Father. I'll take care of it immediately. Wait here, Father. That guy Logan is here. He made it all the way to the Dragon Palace. You must be happy, but don't get your hopes up, darling. You're mine, all mine. Till death do us part. It's for the benefit of the Kurohagi and Yashida families. Go now, Koh! We'll cover you! I was told by Mr. Kurohagi that no one was to come in at all. Old man! Koh, it's been a long time.

 Shingen Yashida! Sorry for the delay. My bride-to-be and I would like... ...to thank you all for coming. We will now begin the ceremony. -Where the hell is Shingen? -He suddenly disappeared. Damn! Well, we can't do anything about it now. Let's get the ceremony started. Shingen! Once again, you wish to take over Madripoor... ...by becoming allies with Kurohagi's son. The word "quit" isn't in my vocabulary. -I'm the same way. -Hardly. You just don't know when to give up. What? My greatest regret is not killing you back then. You and your son, who distracted Miyuki, from doing what she was supposed to do. You are the source of all evil. Where do you think he went? I hope he's not lying around somewhere, dead. That old man's pretty good at taking care of himself. Kikyo, where are they keeping Mariko? I have no idea. I don't work for Kurohagi. Is that right? I guess I'll have to kick down every door in this huge place then. Yukio! It's now time to do what I should have done then. You're saying you can determine my fate when you're not in control of your own? Even after all these years, you're still Juo's puppet! Listen to yourself. You're nothing but a doddering old fool... ...living in the past. Rather than taking revenge on me for killing your son... ...you are still focused on Juo, who is dead and moldering in his grave. -You are pathetic. -Shut up! Well done, you are not so easy to kill. What the hell are you? At least I am better than the lowest of the low... ...who happens to be standing right in front of me. And who will die soon! Prepare to die! Shingen Yashida! My name is Yukio and you brutally murdered my parents! As their child, how dare you attack me like this? I will avenge my parents by killing you! And now you want to join them. How touching. Yukio! He will kill you! Get out of the way! I'm gonna make him pay if it's the last thing I do! -I'll kill him! -You'd just be throwing your life away! When did you start caring anyway? Shouldn't you be after Kurohagi? After all, he's the only one who's ever really mattered to you! Well, well. I don't want to take sides in this family squabble... ...so I'll just go ahead and kill you both. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today... ...in the presence of these witnesses... ...to join Hideki Kurohagi of Madripoor, son of Juo Kurohagi... ...and Mariko Yashida of Japan, daughter of Shingen Yashida... ...in holy matrimony. Hey! Tell me where your boss is! -I don't know. -It's useless. These guys will do anything for Kurohagi and Shingen. Even if we torture them, they won't say a thing. So much for that idea. How about you? What happened? If it were Kurohagi's son... ...he could have easily been stopped. You weren't expecting me to show up, were you? Why don't you take your petty grudge into the next world? Stand still and take it like a man. Face it, I'm doing you a favor by ending your miserable life! Now it's your turn! Logan! Take care of the old man. Yukio. You look like you're doing well, Shingen. You too. -Are you ready to finish what we started? -I've been looking forward to it. Perhaps you've been waiting for me? I stick by what I said in Japan. -Release Mariko. -I am the one who made her a part... ...of the Kurohagi family. I can't let a punk like you ruin such a good match. If I'm a punk... ...then you're the king of cockroaches! If you force her to marry you... ...you'll be sorry later. Shut the hell up! You're not as good as they say you are... ...if you can't stop Kikyo. I can certainly understand your disappointment, Shingen. However, if you recall, I, Kikyo Mikage... ...told you that I would only fight... ...if it was fair. It doesn't matter. Cancel our contract. It would be a pleasure to kill him myself. Koh! Yukio! Mariko! What are you waiting for? Come on, we don't have all day. Do I have to do everything myself? Hurry up, drink! Drink! Mariko! Mariko! I'm here! Logan! For years, I've only wanted to do one thing. And that is to kill Kurohagi's son with that very hand. But it's better this way. Because... ...I've come to terms with the fact that... ...I couldn't save your parents. Life is a war, Yukio. It's not over until your last breath. Choose your battles more wisely... ...than I did, Yukio. Grandpa. Hold it right there, Logan! This is between us. Be fair. You won't listen to me anyways. You're the one who came in here trying to steal the bride on her wedding day! Is that right? Look who's talking! I don't think "stealing" is the right choice of word. You always have a lot to say for yourself. Come any closer and I'll do it! Logan! Don't worry about me. Go now, while you still can. You came for me, that's already enough. -Please, it doesn't matter. -Mariko! Don't give up. I came all the way here... ...to rescue you... ...from this punk. Logan, please. Well, go ahead, Romeo! Try and take her from me! See how far you get! I hope you didn't have big plans for the honeymoon! No! Don't shoot! One of you might hit me! -Mariko. -Yes. Come on, Logan! Logan! -Enough of that! You're coming with me! -Logan! Logan! Mariko! Don't worry! Wherever you are, I'll find you. You won't escape this time, Logan. It's over! It is time to settle this. I'm going to cut you into 100 little pieces. Shut it. Let's get this over with. I shall take my first step into this land where everything has been destroyed. I got him. That's all that matters. This is where it all gets decided. You'll have to kill me first. Such language. Seems it's my place to teach you some respect. {\an8}Next time on Wolverine: "Logan."
