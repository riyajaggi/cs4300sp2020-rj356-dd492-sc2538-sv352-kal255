I'm here to find Mariko... ...not mess around with you! I'm gonna have to take a rain check. Yes, you're distracted. You'd be thinking of her, not the battle at hand. There would be little honor... ...in defeating such an opponent. You play by samurai rules, huh? Now, get out of my way, will you? I've already wasted too much time. However... ...do you really believe it will be that easy?

 What? Well, the big bad Wolverine.... Kurohagi.... Kurohagi! You insect! I hope I'm not supposed to be quaking in my boots, Logan. You'll never get by my defenses. You've come all this way for nothing. Don't flatter yourself, dirtbag. I didn't come here for you. If I did come here for you, I'd probably do something like this! Should've known you'd hide behind something, you coward. Kikyo. If you don't mind my asking... ...as my soon-to-be father-in-law's hired executioner... ...how about doing a little work? If you want it done now, you'll have to call in your other executioner. Let me just watch for now.

 Other executioner? Aren't we the picky one. Great, him again. Just what I need. Vadhaka! So this is where he's been. I was kind of hoping he'd been sent to the gravel pit. I really hate this stinking statue. Vadhaka has changed a little. I know you're dying to see me married to Mariko, but I'm afraid your name's... ...not on the guest list. I'll let you catch the bouquet. Koh-sama! Kurohagi! Wait! I know your weak spots! Yeah, he's changed a little, all right. Wolverine, you must die! Logan! Die! -The building's shaking! -Felt like an earthquake! Please stay calm. There's nothing to worry about! The wedding ceremony will begin as planned. Logan. Logan! Anyone ever tell you you could lose a few pounds? Thought you could just squish me like a bug, huh? I'd love to go a few more rounds, but I've got a wedding to stop! The bigger they are, the harder they're gonna fall! Logan! Koh-sama! Don't stop. What's wrong with you? We're very sorry! Enough! Kurohagi-sama! Crap! Koh-sama, are you all right? Koh-sama! Vadhaka! Where are you? Is Logan dead yet? I hope so, for your sake. Kurohagi! Is that Koh? -Sir. -The grounds are crawling with intruders! Get out there and take care of them. Massacre them all! Koh-sama! Min, come back! Hang in there! Guns are for cowards. Worse when they're used against children. Have you no honor? Kikyo! Kikyo. You actually look surprised to see me. You should know better than that. Kurohagi! Wolverine! You must die! You just won't take no for an answer, will you? Finish him! Now, Vadhaka, what are you waiting for? Koh-sama! Logan. I'm the best there is at what I do. But what I do isn't very.... Koh-sama! Stay away. You hear? Don't you dare touch him! Run, kid! Run! Kill, Vadhaka! Kill them all! Stop! Min! For that, you're gonna pay! Must kill Wolverine! Kikyo. I'm not just some kid you can knock around. I know you're just following orders... ...but when they are to attack children... ...you have to be put down! For a hired killer, you're awful sentimental. Who knew you had a heart? Hey, you might just have a soul in there somewhere. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone! Damn it! Vadhaka's been powered up by AIM. Even if you both attack with your claws all at once, you'll never win! Koh-sama.... Min. That guy, Kurohagi.... Make sure you.... I know. Min. Perhaps... ...this would have... ...happened to me... ...a long time ago. That wind trick! Nothing? Not a scratch? That didn't even faze him. Damn. Vadhaka. I've fought uglier and I've fought bigger! They all end up the same way. Dead. So if you want to take a stab at me, go ahead! Do your worst, but you'll end up like dust! I don't think he's the listening type, Kikyo! Do it! Done. Up till now, I have revealed to you only half my strength. Let her rip! Well, well, what do you know. The Man of Stone has a soft spot, too. Now that's a statue. I'm no art critic, but I know what I like. It's over. That guy Logan's here! He's made it all the way to the Dragon Palace! I still haven't achieved my objective. Koh, it's been a long time. My bride-to-be and I would like to thank you all for coming. I will avenge my parents by killing you! Mariko! I'm here! Logan! Next on Wolverine: Kurohagi. Watch Full HD Movies & TV Shows with Subtitles for Free ---> osdb.link/tv
