OH, MAN, LONG TIME AGO, 25 YEARS AGO. HE WAS DEFINITELY A WALKING PIRATE. PHIL HARRIS WAS A GREAT FISHERMAN, I LOOKED UP TO HIM. WELL, THE SUN SHINES ON A DOG'S ASS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. SO I GUESS IT'S MY TURN. JUST GETTING WARMED UP. [ CHUCKLES ] HE'S, YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT -- MENTOR? SEE YA, MAN, YOU LOOK GOOD, YOU LOOK GOOD, BROTHER. LET'S GO OUT AND DO IT. GET IT DONE AND, UH... WE'LL SHOW HIM HOW IT'S DONE. SKIPPER STYLE OVER HERE. LIVING, MODERN-DAY PIRATE. THAT'S YOU, TOO! YOU TWO ARE TWO PEAS IN A POD. AS JONATHAN HAS JOINED UP WITH CASEY AND I, HE'S BEEN HELPING US LOOK AT THE ISLAND AND THE CHARTS, THE WAY THAT, PROBABLY, MY DAD WOULD'VE. JUST LOOK AT THE FLOWERS. IT'S JUST AMAZING, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WALK OUT IN THE MORNING IN YOUR BOXERS ON THE BALCONY. IT'S PERFECT. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I'VE ALWAYS -- I'VE ALWAYS IMAGINED HEAVEN IS, LIKE, LIKE, YOU'RE WALKING ON CLOUDS, LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE WAY UP. YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING. I THINK WHEN YOU WALK OUT TO THE EDGE OF HEAVEN, YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I CAN SEE WHAT MY DAD LOVED IT OUT HERE. YEAH. SO RIGHT NOW, CASEY, JOHN, AND I ARE HEADED TO A PLACE NAMED AFTER A LEGENDARY EXPLORER, CAPTAIN COOK, THAT JOHN THINKS DAD WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY LOVED. YOU KNOW, PHIL BROUGHT YOU TO HOMER BEFORE. THAT'S WHERE CAPTAIN COOK -- IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL IN COOK INLET THAT HE NAMED THAT PLACE AFTER HIMSELF. SO HE NAMED THIS PLACE ALSO -- THIS IS WHERE HE ENDED UP DYING, DOWN HERE, RIGHT DOWN THE HILL. RIGHT DOWN BY THAT MONUMENT. Josh: HOPEFULLY IN TALKING TO LOCALS HERE WE CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS HERE FISHERY. BETTER UNDERSTAND IT ON A GRASSROOTS, OR, WELL, I GUESS A GRASS SKIRTS KIND OF LEVEL. ¶ ALL RIGHT. -HONKIN' IT UP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I CAN IMAGINE YOUR DAD HANGING OUT DOWN HERE, MAN. DUDE,I COULD TOO. A LOT OF HAPPY PEOPLE. ¶ DUDE -- DONKEY BALLS! DONKEY BALLS! THAT'S A PHIL PLACE. LET'S GO IN THERE? CAN'T SAY "DONKEY BALLS" WITH A STRAIGHT FACE. HOW'S IT GOIN'? VERY WELL. WHAT EXACTLY IS A DONKEY BALL? MACADAMIA NUT COVERED IN LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF CHOCOLATE. -REALLY? -HAVING HILLSTRAND HERE HAS JUST BEEN AWESOME, HE -- HE REALLY HELPS US UNDERSTAND AND KIND OF SEE THE WORLD THROUGH PHIL'S EYES. DONKEY BALLS. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE, CAN YOU? [ LAUGHS ] YOU KNOW, WE'RE FOLLOWING IN PHIL'S FOOTSTEPS HERE, THE MORE LOCALS WE MEET, THE MORE FRIENDS WE MAKE, THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT THE FISHERY HERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE? MY DAD WAS A FISHERMAN UP IN ALASKA AND WE FOUND THIS OLD CHART THAT HE HAD OF HAWAII. SO WE'RE HERE CHASING DOWN A DREAM ON MY FATHER'S. OH, COOL! WELL, THERE'S A FELLOW NAMED DREW WHO KNOWS A LOT ABOUT FISHING IN THIS ISLAND. HE'S PRETTY GOOD GUY TO KNOW REALLY? OKAY. HE HAS A FRUIT STAND. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. WELL, I GUESS THAT'S WHERE OUR NEXT STOP'S GOING TO BE. GO DOWN AND FIND DREW. WE'RE GONNA GO SEE DREW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION. ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE'VE OFFICIALLY EXPERIENCED DONKEY BALLS. AND THEY ARE GOOD. THE JOURNEY CONTINUES. DUDE, THESE LOCKS, YOU PUT THE BACK YOUR ARM ON THERE ON THAT LOCK, IT SUCKS IT IN. OH, [BLEEP]! SUCKS THE SKIN OF BOTH SIDES OF MY ARM RIGHT INTO THE WINDOW. WELL, PHIL USED TO PINCH THE BACK OF YOUR ARMS. YEAH. [BLEEP] HE'D BE PINCHIN' THE BACK OF YOUR [BLEEP] ARM. 'BOUT RIGHT HERE. YEAH! YEAH, [BLEEP]! [BLEEP] MY DAD, HE WAS A PEOPLE'S PERSON. [ LAUGHTER ] PISS ME OFF. IT'S A PACKAGE DEAL, PHIL -- WE NEED YOU AND THE BOAT, SO... I DEFINITELY KNOW MY DAD WOULD USE LOCAL INTEL. Man: SHE GOES, "AND THEN WHEN IT GOES TO ADVANCE AGAIN, IT'S GOING TO BREAK THAT UP. THE HARD PACKS STUFF WHEN IT COMES BACK DOWN AGAIN." Josh: HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO LEARN ALL THE TRICKS OF THE TRADE, THE SECRET SPOTS -- THAT'S WHY HE WAS SO GOOD ON THE BERING SEA. YEE-HAW! NOW, THAT'S ONE FULL CRAB POT. WE'RE HEADED TO FIND FRUIT-STAND DREW. ¶ GET SOME FRUIT. -"COOK'S BOUNTY." -HOW WE DOIN', GUYS? COOK'S BOUNTY FRUIT STAND. ALOHA, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? I'M DREW. NICE TO MEET YOU, DREW. JONATHAN. JOSH. I'M CASEY. WELCOME. HOW ARE WE DOING? JOSH. COOK'S BOUNTY. WHAT DO YOU GUYS ALL GOT HERE? SOME JAMS, JELLIES, HONEYS, DRIED FRUITS. YOU EVER MONKEY AROUND WITH FISHING OUT HERE? I DID -- BACK IN THE EARLY '80s, I USED TO GO WITH A BOAT CALLED THE SEA GENIE PICKING UP SOME BIG AHI AND ONO. REALLY? YOU KNOW, TONIGHT IS A FULL MOON. WHEN THE MOON IS FULL. THE ANCIENT HAWAIIANS USED THIS SPECIAL TECHNIQUE CALLED IKA-SHIBI. -REALLY? PRETTY SURE THAT I'VE SEEN THE TERM IKA-SHIBI ON MY DAD'S CHARTS, BUT I NEVER KNEW WHAT IT WAS. THEY USED TO CARRY THOSE TORCHES AND THEY'D LIGHT UP THE TORCHES AND LIGHT THE WATER UP AND THEY WOULD COME TO THE SURFACE AND THEY WOULD GET THE FISH FOR THE KING. REALLY? I'VE LEARNED LITTLE BITS LEFT AND RIGHT HERE. RIGHT ON. IT'S AMAZING. NICE TO MEET YOU. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. PLEASE COME BACK AND VISIT US ANY TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DON'T FORGET TO GO OUT THERE AND CHUM THE WATERS AT NIGHT DURING THE FULL MOON WITH THE COCONUT LANTERN. [ LAUGHS ] BUM-BUM-BUM, FISHIN' IN THE MOONLIGHT ON THIS HOT IKA-SHIBI NIGHT. ¶ -Casey: ALL RIGHT. -[ JOSH LAUGHS ] THANK YOU FOR THE A/C. ¶ THERE WAS SOME SPOTS ON MY DAD'S CHART THAT SAID "IKA-SHIBI," SO THIS IS MAKING SENSE TO ME. I MEAN, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE FATE WHEN IT'S THERE. AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. HEY, CUPCAKE. WAS THAT HIS LINE? DAD WOULD JUST SAY IT TO PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING A LITTLE TUBBY. WHAT'S UP, CUPCAKE? [ LAUGHING ] ¶ THIS IS THE COOLEST, THANKS FOR BRINGING ME OUT HERE, GUYS. DUDE, IT WAS FUN, MAN. I HAD SO MUCH FUN DOING THIS. I HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE, GUYS. Josh: IT'S BEEN AWESOME HAVING HILLSTRAND IN HAWAII WITH US THE PAST COUPLE DAYS, BUT HE'S GOT TO HEAD HOME TO HIS FAMILY NOW. HAVING JOHNATHAN HERE IS, LIKE, JUST ABOUT THE NEXT BEST THING AS HAVING MY DAD HERE. YOUR DAD -- YOU DAD WOULD BE SO PROUD OF YOU, MAN. THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY -- AND I'M PROUD OF YOU. THANKS, MAN. HERE'S TO YOUR DAD, AND HERE'S TO YOU GUYS. THANKS. [BLEEP] LOVE YA, PHIL. I TALK TO PHIL EVERY DAY, I TALKED TO PHIL WHENEVER I WANT TO TALK TO PHIL. I TALK TO HIM -- "HEY, PHIL." AND I KNOW HE'S WATCHING HIS SON, I KNOW HE'S PROUD. AND THAT'S A FACT, JACK. WELL, MAN, I -- THANKS FOR THE BEST VACATION, THE BEST ADVENTURE, AND YOU GUYS, GOOD LUCK TONIGHT FISHING, MAN. [ CAR HONKS ] THAT'S MY RIDE, MAN. I GOT TO GO, GUYS. THAT'S IT? LOVE YA, BROTHER. YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. THANK YOU FOR COMING UP. CHUCK, BROTHER. CHUCK, BROTHER. 'KAY, MAN. TAKE 'ER EASY, BRO. YOU GUYS HAVE FUN NIGHT FISHING TONIGHT. BE CAREFUL OUT THERE. CRAZY STUFF HAPPENS AT NIGHT ON THE WATER. HEY, HILLSTRAND. KIND OF GIVE YOU THE BUG TO GO BACK UP NORTH AND DO SOME MORE FISHIN'? MAYBE. [ LAUGHS ] HAVE TO SEE. LOVE YOU, BROTHER! SEE [BLEEP] -- YOU CAN TAKE A MAN OUT OF THE BERING SEA, BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE THE BERING SEA OUT OF THE MAN. HE'S GOT THAT LOOK LIKE... HE'S ALL FISHY AGAIN. REMEMBER, HE WAS LIKE, "OH, I'M GONNA RETIRE, GONNA BE WITH MY GRANDDAUGHTER"? NOW I SEE HIM. HE'S JUST, LIKE, HE'S GOT THAT ITCHY BUG BACK. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE LOCATION WHERE WE'RE GOING TONIGHT FOR NIGHT FISHING. ¶ LOOK AT THIS. SO YOUR DAD WROTE IT DOWN THERE. KONA NIGHT FISHING. MY DAD WAS THE GUY THAT WENT 24/7, WHETHER HE WAS PLAYING OR WORKING. THESE ARE THE NIGHTS LIKE THIS THAT LITERALLY DRAIN YA. I MEAN, MY BODY IS JUST TENSED UP. Josh: I KNOW IF MY DAD WAS TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO SERIOUSLY MASS THIS FISHERY, HE'D DEFINITELY WANT TO LEARN WHAT IT TAKES TO FISH DAY AND NIGHT. BOOM. THERE'S FIVE DIFFERENT SPOTS HERE THAT I'VE SEEN WITHOUT LOOKING THAT HARD. THERE'S LIKE THERE, THERE, THERE. THIS SAYS "IKA-SHIBI, 1 AHI, 140 POUND." AND LOOKIT, ALL THESE SPOTS HERE, THEY HAVE THAT "IKA-SHIBI." "IKA-SHIBI, NICE FISHING, 2 AHI, 180 POUND." THIS ONE HAS "140 POUND AHI" WRITTEN NEXT TO IT. PHIL WASN'T JUST TALKING TO LOCALS ABOUT WHEN AND WHERE TO FISH. IT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS ACTUALLY LEARNING SOME DIFFERENT TIPS AND TECHNIQUES TOO. LOOK AT THIS: "IKA-SHIBI SEEMS TO BITE BETTER WITH THE MOON PHASE GETTING BIGGER." ASSUMING PHIL'S NOTATIONS ON THE CHART ARE CORRECT, IT SEEMS LIKE THE STARS AND THE MOON COULD BE ALIGNED IN OUR FAVOR. SO WHAT DOES IT SAYIN' THAT WE DO? SAYS HERE, "AT TIMES PEOPLE HAVE USED VARIOUS COLORS OF LIGHTS TO DANGLE BELOW THE BOATS, COMBINED WITH HEAVY CHUMMING TO LURE THE PREDATORS IN." IT SAYS RIGHT THERE IT CAN BE VERY PRODUCTIVE FOR BIG FISH. SO MAYBE THEY'RE COMING IN AT NIGHT. YEAH. THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME WE FISHED THESE WATERS AFTER DARK. I HEARD A STORY ABOUT ONE OF THESE GUYS, NIGHTTIME FISH, AND HE LEANED OVER THE SIDE OF THE BOAT TO WASH HIS HANDS AND A MAKO SHARK WAS WAITING FOR HIM AND CAME AFTER HIM, TRIED TO GET HIM. AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS NOW? WELL, YEAH. MY OLD MAN EXPERIMENTED WITH FISHIN' IKA-SHIBI, SO IF HE DID IT, I GUESS IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH TAKING A SHOT. YOU KNOW, IF THE OLD MAN DID IT, THEN I GUESS WE GIVE IT A WHIRL. ONE ERROR, ONE SLIP, ONE MISTAKE. COULD BE THE END, COULD BE DEADLY. NIGHT FISHING -- THIS IS PROBABLY WHEN WEIRD [BLEEP] IS GONNA HAPPEN. HOLY [BLEEP], JOSH, IT'S MASSIVE. I'M ON, I'M ON. REALLY BIG FISH, MAN. [BLEEP] BEARING IN MIND. THAT'S A BIG [BLEEP]. ¶ HOW YOU GUYS DOING? WE'RE GOING NIGHT FISHING. WHAT DO WE NEED? TONIGHT, CASEY AND I HAVE A DATE WITH DESTINY UNDER THE MOONLIT SKY. HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO LAND SOME BIG, BEAUTIFUL, BOUNTIFUL FISH. IKA-SHIBI. LIGHTS, YEAH. TONIGHT WE'RE TRYING THE HAWAIIAN WAY OF NIGHT FISHING CALLED IKA-SHIBI. MY DAD ALSO EXPERIMENTED WITH THIS WHILE HE WAS HERE. IT'S THE FIRST TIME CASEY AND I ARE GONNA TRY THIS IKA-SHIBI FISHING. YOU GUYS HAVE SOME IN STOCK? YES, WE DO, WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT COLORS. WHEN THE LOCALS FISH HERE AT NIGHT, THEY ACTUALLY DROP A GREEN LIGHT IN THE WATER, WHICH DRAWS A LITTLE BAITFISH AND LITTLE BAIT SQUID IN. AND THEN THE PREDATORS COME IN LOOKING TO EAT THOSE. GOTCHA. SO WE GOTTA BUY TWO LIGHTS. JUST GOT MORE EXPENSIVE. OKAY. SOMETIMES YOU GET TO SPEND MONEY TO MAKE MONEY. WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE? HOW BIG ARE THEY? THEY'RE RIGHT WHERE ROGER'S STANDING. THAT LITTLE TINY THING? THAT'S IT? YEAH. REALLY? SOMETHIN' I LEARNED FROM MY DAD, NO MATTER WHERE YOU'RE FISHING, YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT GEAR FOR THE JOB. SOMETIMES THE RIGHT KIND OF GEAR IS A THOUSAND-POUND CRAB POT. ¶ SOMETIMES... SO YOU WANT GREEN FOR PREDATORS. IT'S A LITTLE GREEN LIGHT BULB ON A STRING. ALL RIGHT. BEAUTIFUL, $46.77. AND YOU COME ON SATURDAYS, WE GOT FREE DONUTS. OOH! STARTING TOMORROW, WE BETTER COME BACK HERE. WHAT DAY IS IT? TODAY'S TUESDAY. THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE IT. ALL RIGHT! DUDE, THAT MARLIN JERK IS AWESOME. OH, YEAH, MARLIN JERKY IS KILLER. ¶ ¶ HEY, UH, JOSH AND I WERE DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THE CHART, WE WANT TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF SPOTS THAT WE THOUGHT MIGHT BE FUN. PASS THIS UP. AFTER READING A LITTLE NOTES ON IT. YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS JUMP ON UP. ALL RIGHT, WHAT WAS POPS UP TO? WE ARE LOOKING AT, LIKE, IKA-SHIBI SPOT HERE. YOU KNOW, KONA IS A REALLY, REALLY GOOD HOT SPOT FOR NIGHTTIME FISHING. AND CHANCES ARE, IS YOUR DAD PROBABLY GOT SOME INFO AND LOOKS LIKE THEY KIND OF GAVE HIM SOME GOOD SCOOPS. DURING THE NIGHT. LOTS OF TIMES, THE AHIS, THEY TRAVEL TOGETHER WITH BIG PACKS. YOU KNOW, THEY COULD BE IN PILES OF HUNDREDS OF THEM. AND YOU HAVE A REALLY GOOD CHANCE OF AT LEAST TRYING TO NOT JUST CATCH ONE, BUT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET SOME NUMBERS. SO I THINK WHEN YOU GUYS ARE READY, GET THE BOATS IN THE WATER AND BOOGIE. LET'S GO. SEE WHAT'S OUT THERE. ¶ YOU RUNNIN'? JOSH, PUT YOUR TRIM DOWN. YOU GOTTA TURN THE MOTOR ON. WHAT'S THAT? YOU GOTTA TURN THE MOTOR ON. I KNOW, I'M JUST MAKING SURE I'M UNHOOKED, I DON'T WANT TO START JERKING ON THE [BLEEP] THING. TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO TRY OUT NIGHT FISHING FOR THE FIRST TIME. I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. ALL RIGHT, CASE, OUR FIRST NIGHT EXCURSION. ONE ERROR, ONE SLIP, ONE MISTAKE, JUST FROM BEING A LITTLE BIT FATIGUED, YOU KNOW, COULD BE THE END, COULD BE DEADLY. YOU KNOW. SO LIKE TO DO A QUICK PULE. [ SPEAKING HAWAIIAN ] ...FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL DAY, JUST PRAY THAT YOU ARE WITH ME, YOU WATCH OVER MY FAMILY, MY FRIENDS, MY LOVED ONES, PEOPLE OF [ HAWAIIAN ], WATCH OVER MY VESSEL AND WATCH OVER MYSELF OUT HERE. GIMME SOME GOOD LUCK, GONNA TRY TO CATCH A FISH. [ HAWAIIAN ] THAT'S IT. IT'S ALL FUN AND GAMES NOW. LET'S GO TRY TO GET SOMETHING. THE BOYS ARE ALREADY ON THEIR WAY OUT. SO LET'S GO GET IT. ¶ Josh: THIS MIGHT BE A LONG NIGHT, BUT WE'RE GOING TO GET IT DONE. MY DAD ALWAYS TOLD ME STICK AND STAY AND MAKE IT PAY. WHICH TO LAYMAN'S TERMS WOULD BE NEVER GIVE UP. Phil: TODAY'S A "SMOKE SOME CIGARETTES, DRINK LOTS OF CAFFEINE" DAY. THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON THESE TRIPS. I GOT TO STAY OUT HERE AND GET SOME CRAB OUTTA THIS GEAR TODAY. THIS IS A SPOT ON THE CHART, MAN. WHO WILL SIT AND DRIFT FOR JUST A SECOND TO SEE WHICH WAY IT'S GOING. Josh: THIS IS NOT OUR FIRST TIME FISHIN' AT NIGHT BY A LONG SHOT, BUT IT DEFINITELY IS THE FIRST TIME BEING OUT IN THE DARK ON A BOAT THIS SMALL. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A BIG SHARK UNTIL HE GOT CLOSE TO THE BOAT, AND THEN IT WAS, "AAGH!" GOT THIS HERE LIGHT. APPARENTLY IT'S GOING TO BE BLINDING BRIGHT HERE SHORTLY. SO THIS IS SUPPOSED TO ATTRACT SOME FISH. MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE ANY KNOTS. ¶ THAT LOOKS COOL. LIGHT THE VOID. WELL, I'M GOING AFTER SOMETHING BIG. NOW, I SUPPOSE WE JUST GOT TO WAIT FOR THE FISH TO COME TO US. ¶ Casey: SO IT JUST TURNED MY LIGHT ON. ALREADY GOT BAIT SHOWING UP ON THE SCREEN. THIS IS ALL BAITFISH, PROBABLY SOME SQUID, SOME IKA STARTING TO BUILD UP WITH THE PLANKTON. IT'S A GOOD SIGN -- WE JUST SHOT UP, AND WE'VE ALREADY MARKED A COUPLE OF FISH, SO IF I CAN GET MY BAIT AND GET EVERYTHING SET UP IN TIME, I'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP THESE FISH UNDERNEATH MY BOAT AND HOPEFULLY I CAN GET ONE OF THESE GUYS TO BITE. LITTLE BABY SQUID AROUND THE LIGHT. -IS THERE? -YEAH. SEE ALL THOSE LITTLE WHITE SQUIGGLIES? -OH, YEAH. -BABY SQUID. Josh: PART ONE OF IKA-SHIBI FISHING IS NOW A SUCCESS. OUR LIGHTS ARE ALREADY STARTING TO ATTRACT LITTLE FISH; NOW WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE BIG BOYS TO SHOW UP AND FIND OUR BAIT. [ BEEPING ] THERE IS SOMETHING DOWN THERE. THERE'S A MARK THERE, A LITTLE ONE. THAT'S, WHAT, 50? THEY'RE GOING DEEPER. TRY GETTING LOWER -- LET'S GIVE IT A WHIRL. SEE WHAT HAPPENS. [ REEL RATCHETING ] WE'RE JUST GOING TO DRIFT JUST WITH THE CURRENT AND THE WIND; WE USE THE LIGHT TO DRAW PLANKTON AND LITTLE SMALL BAITFISH. THIS IS THE HANDLINE SETUP. BASICALLY HOOK A PIECE OF BAIT, THROW IT IN THE WATER, AND IT BASICALLY JUST HANGS OFF THE SIDE OF YOUR BOAT. IKA-SHIBI NIGHT FISHING -- EVERYTHING OUT THERE IS DARK. SO YOU'RE TURNING LIGHTS ON. YOU'RE ATTRACTING BAIT TO THE BOAT. YOU'RE FLINGING CHUM IN THE WATER. YOU'RE KIND OF CREATING YOUR OWN ECOSYSTEM AT NIGHT. WE JUST THREW SOME PALU IN THE WATER. WE JUST THREW OUR FIRST LINE OUT. SO WE'RE DOWN HERE, SO WE'RE GOOD. FISH SEES THE LIGHT, SEES THE BAIT, SEES ALL THE CHUM IN THE WATER. YOU'VE GOT LINES IN THE WATER. COULD BE REALLY GOOD FISHING. MOON'S FULL, EVERYTHING'S ADDING UP FOR SOMETHING FOR US TO HAPPEN. WE JUST GOT TO GET A BITE SO WE CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING ELSE. WE'RE JUST A WAITING GAME AT THIS POINT. CASEY: MY ASS IS HURTIN'. [ SPLASHING ] HOLY [BLEEP]! JOSH, COME LOOK OVER THE SIDE REAL QUICK. HOLY [BLEEP]. WHALE SHARK, AND IT'S A MASSIVE. ¶ HOLY [BLEEP] JOSH, COME LOOK OVER THE SIDE REAL QUICK. HOLY [BLEEP]. THAT THING'S HUGE. OH, IT'S A -- [BLEEP] WHALE SHARK, AND IT'S A MASSIVE. WOW. THE WHALE SHARK IS THE LARGEST FISH IN THE OCEAN. CRAZY, THAT THING'S THE SIZE OF THE BOAT. THE WHALE SHARK, TO THE HAWAIIANS, HAS BEEN A SYMBOL OF GOOD LUCK AND PROSPERITY. I WAS FALLING ASLEEP ABOUT THREE SECONDS AGO, AND THEN I HEAR THIS LITTLE -- THAT THING, THAT'S WAY COOL. AND THAT'S KIND OF WHY I WANTED ONE ON MY ARM. LIKE THREE DAYS LATER, WE GOT A WHALE SHARK NEXT TO THE BOAT? THIS IS THE WEIRDEST THING IN THE WORLD. HERE, LITTLE BUDDY. -HE'S SMILING AT YA. -HE'S WINKING. HE WANTS TO SAY HI. YOU KNOW, IT'S PRETTY RARE TO SEE ONE OF THESE THINGS. AND IT KEPT COMING AROUND TO HANG OUT WITH US. LIKE, IT DIDN'T JUST, LIKE, "OH, LOOK, THERE'S A GREEN LIGHT IN A BOAT," AND LEAVE. THAT MEANS THE GREEN LIGHT WORKS BECAUSE THAT GUY CAME AROUND TO EAT ALL THE LITTLE ZOOPLANKTON. YEAH. HOPE THIS WHALE SHARK'S A GOOD OMEN. IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S TAKING OFF THERE, JOSH. THANKS FOR HANGING OUT, SHARK BUDDY. ¶ CHOPPING UP A LITTLE BIT OF BAIT HERE. CHUM THESE LITTLE SUCKERS UP. SOMETHING'S DOWN THERE, AT LEAST KEEP IT ENTERTAINED. I REMEMBER ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO AS A CAPTAIN ON A BIG CRAB BOAT, AND I'M BACK TO BEING THE BAIT BOY. DAMN! DECISIONS IN LIFE, HUH? I DUNNO, I GUESS THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE BIG SCHOOLS OF FISH THAT TRAVEL AT NIGHT AROUND THESE PARTS, BUT RIGHT NOW, THIS ISN'T EXACTLY A DREAM RUN YET. WONDER HOW JEFF'S DOING. SO, OUT HERE, IKA-SHIBI FISHING, IT'S 3:00 A.M., WE MARKED A COUPLE OF FISH, WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY BITES YET. I KNOW THAT THERE'S BIG FISH AROUND. WE JUST GOTTA JUST KIND OF STICK WITH OUR SYSTEM. OUR BOYS ARE RIGHT OVER HERE. YOU CAN SEE THIS RED LIGHT THAT'S KIND OF BOBBING IN AND OUT OF THE WATER RIGHT THERE. THAT'S CASEY. AND THAT'S GOOD. THEY'RE ABOUT THE DISTANCE AWAY THAT WE WANT TO HAVE THEM. THIS IS CASEY AND JOSH'S FIRST TIME OUT HERE AT NIGHT, IKA-SHIBI. SO I'M GOING TO CALL THEM AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE OKAY. 'CAUSE WHO KNOWS -- MAYBE THEY CAUGHT SOMETHING. [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] HEY, JEFF. WHAT'S HAPPENING? WELL, WE'RE WORKING HARD AT IT. WE'RE CHUNKING A LITTLE BAIT AND THROWIN' IT OVER. HOW'S JOSH? WELL, I HAVEN'T CAUGHT A FISH YET, SO I'D SAY NOT AWESOME. YEAH, WHALE SHARK CAME UP TO THE BOAT, THOUGH. THAT WAS PRETTY COOL. WOW. A WHALE SHARK?  THAT'S CRAZY. ALL RIGHT, MAN, WELL,  STICK WITH IT, IT'S TRIAL-AND-ERROR, MAN,  DON'T LET IT BEAT YOU UP. I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF SOMETHING HAPPENS, BUT I'M JUST GONNA KIND OF WAIT, MAN, JUST A WAITING GAME. YOU KNOW THE DRILL. WAIT IT OUT. WE SET THE POTS, NOW WE GOTTA LET 'EM SOAK. ALL RIGHT, I GONNA PULL UP AND CHECK THE BAIT. I'LL GET HER BACK DOWN IN A MINUTE. -ALL RIGHT, BYE. -BYE. WELL, IT'S PRETTY. PRETTY STUPID WE'RE NOT IN BED SLEEPING. [LAUGHING] SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING MY DAD WOULD SAY. I BET YOU IT'S ON THE CHART SOMEWHERE. EVERY TIME WE LEAVE THE DOCK, WE LEAVE IN THE RED. WE CAN'T GO BACK TO THE DOCK WITH AN EMPTY BOX. GOT TO PUT SOMETHING IN IT. ALL RIGHT, "WIKI-SHIBI" WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. YOU GOING WITH THE LITTLE DRAGON, HUH? YEAH, GONNA [BLEEP] GET. BUNCH OF TIMES, ACTUALLY. NIGHT FISHING WAS A COMPLETE BUST FOR US. BUT WE'RE NOT DONE FISHING YET. WE DON'T GIVE UP THAT EASY. GUESS WE'LL THROW OUT A COUPLE OF ONO LURES. -START TO LET IT OUT. -SEE IF WE CAN'T GET LUCKY. WE'RE GONNA GO TROLL FOR ONO. AND RIGHT NOW, WITH THE SUN COMING OVER THE HILL, IS THE PERFECT TIME FOR THE BITE. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL WHITEFISH, ONE OF THE MOST FLAVORFUL FISH IN THE WORLD. THESE THINGS HIT PRETTY HARD? OH, YEAH. THEY HIT REAL HARD. SOMETIMES THEY COME OUT OF THE WATER. PRETTY RARE, BUT I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN. Josh: WHATEVER IT TAKES, WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT GOING BACK TO THE DOCK EMPTY HANDED. HERE COMES THE SUN, LOOK AT THAT, IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO... YOU GOT 25 AND I'LL GO 40. OKAY. HOOK'S IN THE WATER. ¶ WHAT I'M DOING NOW IS I'M USING MY RECORDER, I'M USING MY FISH FINDER, I'M LOOKING FOR BAIT BALLS AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO GET OVER THEM. SUN'S COMING UP, SO I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THE BASICS, HUNT FOR SIGNS OF LIFE, LOOK FOR BIRD PILES, BAITFISH. I'VE GOT TO CATCH A FISH. I'M GOING TO GRIND IT OUT. SO DECIDED TO THROW SOME LURES, HOOK SOME LIVE BAIT. I'M DONE WAITING FOR A FISH TO COME TO ME. IT'S TIME TO GO FIND THEM. I'M GONNA DRAG A BAIT AROUND HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT, AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET A BITE. WE'RE MARKING SOME FISH, NOT A LOT, BUT WE JUST GOT TO KIND OF STICK OUR GUT AND TRUST IN WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET A BITE. WHO KNOWS? WHO KNOWS WHAT WE'LL FIND? ¶ THE SUNRISE. THAT'S BITCHIN', HUH? ¶ WE GOT A BUNCH OF BAIT THAT'S KIND OF STARTING TO COME OVER TO THE BOAT -- YOU CAN KIND OF SEE IT KIND OF JUMPING OUT HERE. YOU CAN SEE THIS BAIT PILE RIGHT HERE. THESE ARE BIGGER FISH THAT'S PUSHING THIS BAIT PILE UP. SO IT'S SHOWING THAT THERE'S BIGGER FISH AROUND. THEY JUST HAVEN'T BIT YET. [ REEL RATCHETING RAPIDLY ] ALL RIGHT, WE'RE TIED ON SOMETHING. DUNNO HOW BIG IT IS, IT'S ACTING WEIRD. DIDN'T TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF LINE. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A REAL BIG FISH OR HE'S JUST NOT HOOKED RIGHT? OH, YEAH, IT'S AN AHI, IT'S A NICE ONE. LOOKS LIKE HE'S ABOUT MAYBE 60, 70 POUNDS. HE'S FIGHTING REALLY WEIRD, THOUGH. THIS IS A VERY, VERY NICE FISH. I GOT ONE SHOT GETTING THIS GUY IN THE BOAT. SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE. SUN IS JUST COMING UP. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BITE WHEN THE SUN COMES UP. I DON'T KNOW [BLEEP]. I'M OUT HERE RIGHT NOW. CASEY WENT DOWN, WE DID ALL THE NIGHT FISHING, THAT WASN'T VERY SUCCESSFUL. IKA-SHIBI FISHING SUCKED. NOW I'M TRYING TO CATCH MY FIRST ONO. ¶ [ REEL CLICKING ] HEY! WHAT'S THAT? ARE WE ON? CASEY! CASEY? [ SNORING ] CASEY? CASE? CASEY? [ SNORING ] CASEY? CASEY?! CASEY? CASEY! CASE? [ SNORING ] HUH? SEEMS LIKE I HAVE SOMETHING. WHICH SIDE? THAT SIDE. ORE THIS ONE -- THIS ONE'S DANCIN' HARD TOO. YEAH, THAT'S IT. YOU GOT ONE? I THINK THERE'S ONE ON THIS ONE TOO. BRING THAT BITCH IN. NICE JOB, JOSH. GO OVER THROUGH THE HONEY PILE, HUH? I GUESS SO. GOT US A DEVIL! GO FIGURE. CASEY GOES TO BED EARLY AND JOSH COMES HOME WITH TWO. [ BOTH LAUGHING ] OH, YEAH. THIS IS A VERY, VERY NICE FISH. WE'VE GOT A LONG, LONG, LONG NIGHT SHIBI, SO WE DIDN'T REALLY PICK ANYTHING UP AT THE NIGHT, SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN KIND OF MAKE UP FOR IT. I GOT ONE SHOT OF GETTING THIS GUY IN THE BOAT. HE'S KIND OF ACTING KIND OF WEIRD. ¶ [ SNAP ] OH, MY GOSH! THAT WAS A GOOD SIZED FISH, MAN. THAT WAS LIKE AN 80, 90 POUNDER. WE JUST LOST GOOD SIZE AHI RIGHT BY THE BOAT. NOT GOING TO LIE, IT STINGS. STINGS FOR SURE. HE DID A FUNKY LOOP -- LOTS OF TIMES WHAT THOSE GUYS DO IS ONE LAST EFFORT WHEN THEY MAKE A WEIRD TURN, THEY'LL SHAKE THEIR MOUTHS TWO OR THREE TIMES WITH THEIR MOUTH OPEN -- LIKE THAT. AND THEY'LL SPIT THE HOOK OUT. THAT'S A ROUGH ONE. THAT'S A TOUGH ONE TO SWALLOW. BUT IT'S PART OF FISHING. YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO SHAKE IT OFF AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY HERE. BROUGHT THAT FISH RIGHT UP TO THE BOAT, BUT HE HAD OTHER PLANS. GAVE ME A HIGH FIVE WITH HIS SICKLE AND SWAM AWAY. OH, YEAH. HE'S PISSED. YEAH, THEY GET PISSY. THESE ARE MEAN [BLEEP] FISH, TOO, SO WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IS YOU'RE GONNA BRING IT RIGHT UP TO ME AND I'LL LEADER HIM UP, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GAFF HIS ASS. HERE WE ARE, THE FIRST ONO! ¶ NICE JOB, BUDDY, KEEP CRANKING, RIGHT UP HERE, GOOD. HELL YEAH! GET ME THE OTHER GAFF. WELL, YOU GOT ANOTHER ONE TO REEL IN TOO. ¶ THAT'S A DAMN NICE FISH. A DOUBLE, BUDDY! AFTER BEING OUT ALL NIGHT INTO THE MORNING, NOT GETTING EVEN A BITE, IT FEELS PRETTY DAMN GOOD TO NOT ONLY HAVE ONE FISH ON LINE, BUT TWO. ANOTHER NICE ONE, HUH? READY? YEP. ALL RIGHT. TWO BEAUTES. OKAY. PUT THE REST THE BAIT ON THERE, WE'LL PUT A FIVE GALLON BUCKET OF WATER IN THERE, SLOSH IT OUT. TURN RIGHT BACK AROUND. GONNA GET SOME MORE? WE'RE GOING TO GO RIGHT BACK TO THE SAME SPOT. GET 'EM WHILE THEY'RE HOT. LO AND BEHOLD, I TAKE A LITTLE NAP. JOSH NAILS TWO ONO. NICE JOB, JOSH. IMPRESSIVE. BEST DAMNED NAP I EVER TOOK ON THIS BOAT! I WAS LISTENING TO MUSIC, MAN, CHARLIE DANIELS IN MY HEADPHONES, NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I HEAR, ¶ DEVIL WENT DOWN TO GEORGIA ¶ ¶ HE WAS LOOKING FOR A -- ¶ "CASEY!" "CASEY!" I WAS LIKE, I WASN'T THE DEVIL. I LOOK OVER AND THIS WAS ONE'S ALL, "ENH, ENH," AND THIS ONE STARTED DANCING TO THE WALL. "I THINK WE GOT TWO!" OH. THOSE ARE BIG ONO, THOSE ARE NICE FISH. THAT'S $500 WORTH OF ONO. NOT BAD FOR A COUPLE OF BOYS FROM ALASKA. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] WHAT'S HAPPENING, JEFF? WE GOT A DOUBLE HOOKUP ON ONO. AWESOME, COOL. GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB. LANDED THEM BOTH -- THE BIG KIND, TOO. WE GOT TO FIND A MARKET FOR THEM, THEY'RE -- I MEAN, THEY'RE TOO LONG TO FIT IN THE BOX, THEY'RE TOUCHING BOTH ENDS OF THE BOX. THEY'RE BIGGER THAN A FOOTBALL AROUND. THEY'RE NICE. I'M ONLY A MILE AWAY.  I'M COMING. ALL RIGHT, I'LL TEXT YOU  THE COORDINATES. ALL RIGHT. SOUNDS GOOD. ALL RIGHT. SOUNDS GOOD. WE'LL BE OUT THERE. TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK. HOPEFULLY WE CAN CAPITALIZE OFF THE SITUATION. IT'S STILL EARLY. AGAIN, WE HAVE HAD A LONG NIGHT. WE JUST THREW THESE LURES BACK. WE GOT TO JUST KEEP GRINDING IT OUT. KEEP PRESSING FORWARD. [ BEEPING ] OH, YEAH. WE'RE MARKING. YEAH, THERE'S A COUPLE OF THEM. THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY BIG DOWN THERE. -FISH ON. -YOU GOT ONE? OH, YOU GOT A GOOD ONE! THAT'S A GOOD ONE, ISN'T IT? -THAT'S A GOOD ONE. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD ONE. THAT THING'S TAKING LINE. OH, OH, OH, OH. I BET YOU WE GOT AN AHI THE WAY THAT HEAD'S SHAKING. IT MAY HAVE TAKEN US ALL NIGHT, BUT WE'RE FINALLY ON THE FISH. OKAY, I'M GOING ONE MORE CIRCLE. HE'S GOING TO CRUISE. NICE GAFF JOB, JOSH! DUDE, YOU GOT IT RIGHT IN THE SWEET SPOT. THAT'S A 40 POUNDER. YEAH. NICE! OH, JEFF'S GONNA BE HAPPY. THINK WE'RE HAVING THE BEST DAY OF OUR LIVES RIGHT NOW ALMOST. FEELS GOOD. YEAH. I MEAN, WE'RE ON IT TODAY. I MEAN, IT STARTED OFF LITTLE ROUGH, BUT, TELL YOU WHAT, WE'RE REALLY PICKING IT UP. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO GRIND IT OUT. YOU'VE GOT TO WORK HARD AND YOU'VE GOT TO TRUST IN WHAT YOU DO. [ REELING ] I'M ON, I'M ON. THIS IS DEFINITELY BIGGER THAN THE LAST ONE WE JUST HOOKED. I HOPE IT'S AN AHI. NEED AN AHI BAD. TOOK A LOT OF LINE. HE'S RAN ABOUT 60, 70 FATHOMS OF LINE OUT ON ME RIGHT NOW. REALLY BIG FISH, MAN. [BLEEP]. THAT'S A BIG [BLEEP]. I KNOW MY GEAR. I KNOW MY REELS. I KNOW MY RODS, I KNOW MY DRAGS. IT'S A BIG FISH. LOOKS TO BE ABOUT 150, 200-POUNDER. THIS IS THE TIME WHEN YOU REALLY, REALLY GOT TO FOCUS, YOU REALLY, REALLY GOT TO PAY ATTENTION. EVERYTHING YOU DO CAN BE COSTLY. AHI IS WORTH WELL ABOVE 10 BUCKS A POUND RIGHT NOW, SO EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE GET TO EVEN HOOK ONE IS A CHANCE AT A BIG PAYCHECK. SO IF YOU LOOK AT MY RECORDER RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN SEE THIS FISH IS DOWN AT 50 FATHOMS. THAT'S STILL A LONG WAY DOWN. I GOT A LOT OF TENSION ON THIS FISH. I'M NOT BABYING THIS GUY. I WANT TO GET THIS GUY TO THE BOAT. I GOT HIM UP TO ABOUT 35 FATHOMS. I'M AT 20 FATHOMS. I GOT COLOR. HE'S [BLEEP] GREEN. THIS GUY AIN'T GONNA WANT TO COME IN. I'M ALMOST TO MY LEADER. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. WE'VE GOT TO HOOK UP. WE DON'T GOT A FISH RIGHT NOW IN A BOX. A LOT CAN HAPPEN. ¶ ¶ HIS DAD? [ LAUGHS ] ¶ HE'S DOWN THERE. WE GOT A HOOK UP. WE DON'T GOT A FISH RIGHT NOW IN THE BOX. A LOT CAN HAPPEN. AFTER SPENDING ALL NIGHT ON THE WATER WITH NO BITES, I FINALLY GOT ONE, AND IT'S THE BIGGEST FISH I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE. BIG [BLEEP] FISH. ¶ I'M GONNA TAKE HIM RIGHT HERE. ¶ ¶ ¶ SHE'S BIG, BOY. [GRUNTING ] THAT'S AHI. HOLY [BLEEP], THAT'S POSSIBLY MY BIGGEST FISH THIS YEAR, MAN. THINK HE [BLEEP] BROKE MY HAND. SHE'S GOT TO BE AT LEAST 180. SHE'S AS TALL AS ME. ¶ NEVER GETS OLD. NEVER GETS OLD. [ SPEAKING HAWAIIAN ] ¶ I THINK IT'S TIME TO GO HOME AND SEE THE FAMILY. ¶ THAT'S MORE OUR STYLE, THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD GO NIGHT FISHING WITH. NIGHT FISHING, NOT SO GOOD. MORNING FISHING, OH, WE SLAYED IT. IT WAS AWESOME. STICK AND STAY, MAKE IT PAY. THE SUN TRIUMPHANTLY RETURNS FOR THE BOUNTY. BOX FULL OF BOUNTY. LAST NIGHT SUCKED. BUT THE MORNING, AS THE SUN CAME UP ENDED UP HOOKING UP WITH NOT ONE BUT TWO HUGE ONO, AND A NICE AHI. WE'RE [BLEEP] HOME, MAN -- LONG DAY, MAN, LONG DAY. SO TIRED, I CAN'T EVEN COUNT. SUPER STOKED, IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF OUR BEST SUCCESSFUL DAYS THAT WE BOTH CAUGHT FISH, SO THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. YOU KNOW, YOU CATCH FISH IS ONE THING, BUT YOU WANT TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE CATCH FISH TOO, 'CAUSE THEY'RE OUT THERE SPENDING THE TIME IN THE WATER JUST LIKE YOU ARE. SO I'M SUPER HAPPY, MAN. I'M SUPER STOKED. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE BOYS. YOU KNOW, WE GRINDED IT OUT TODAY, BOTH OF US DID. I'M TIRED, BUT IT'S A GOOD TIRED, IT'S A HEALTHY, TIRED. Josh: GREAT FEELING TO BE A WINNER TODAY. Casey: THINK WE SHOULD GUT AND GILL THAT AHI? YEAH! LOOK, MILLY! CAN YOU WAVE TO DADDY? CAN HE SEE YOU? WAVE TO DADDY? MY WHOLE FAMILY'S DOWN HERE TODAY. [ CHUCKLES ] THAT'S AWESOME, MAN. AFTER HAVING A REALLY LONG TRIP, YOU KNOW, 20 PLUS HOURS OUT ON THE WATER, NO SLEEP -- WHEN I'M COMING IN AND THE FIRST THING I SEE IS MY KIDS AND MY WIFE FROM THE DOCK. HI, SWEETIE. HI, LOVE BUG. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST ICING ON THE CAKE FOR A GREAT TRIP. WHY DON'T YOU GUYS SET UP HERE, I'M GOING TO PUT THE BOAT ON THE TRAILER AND I'M GOING TO BRING THE BOAT AND BRING YOU GUYS OUT. YOU GUYS CAN CHECK OUT DADDY'S FISH, ALL RIGHT? WHOO! SAY "DADA!" WHAT A DAY! HI, DADDY. HOW YOU DOING? GOOD, TIRED. HEY! MWAH! I'M BEAT, I'M --- I'M PRETTY CROSS-EYED. WHAT'S UP, HEROES? SLAYED IT OUT THERE. YOU GUYS SLAYED IT. NO, NO, YOU SLAYED IT. YOU GOT THE BIG ONE. TEAMWORK! TEAMWORK. MAKES THE DREAM WORK. WOW. I THINK WE GOT A BIG FISH. YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT? I THINK YOU COULD MAYBE FIT IN ITS MOUTH. YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT, WE'RE NOT JUST FILLING IN THE BLANKS ANYMORE. WE'RE ACTUALLY STARTING TO SUCCEED A LITTLE. LET'S GO -- LET'S GO CHECK OUT THESE FISH, MAN, I WANT TO SEE 'EM. EVEN THOUGH IKA-SHIBI DIDN'T QUITE PAY OFF FOR US, WE STILL HAD A PRETTY DAMN GOOD DAY. I KNOW MY DAD WOULD BE REALLY PROUD. WE STUCK IT OUT TILL WE ENDED UP LANDING SOME FISH. WOW! THAT GUY COULD EAT THIS GUY. IT WAS WORTH IT MAN, WE WORKED HARD. WE GRINDED IT OUT OUT THERE, AND, PHEW... I'M GLAD TO BE IN. I DON'T WANT TO BE -- I DIDN'T WANT TO BE OUT THERE ANY LONGER THAN I HAD TO BE. THAT'S FOR SURE. YOU KNOW, SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO COME HOME WITH THE BIGGEST FISH. BUT RIGHT NOW, I WANT A NAP.

CATCH YOU IN A LITTLE BIT. TAKE CARE. ¶ [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] -HEY, MAN! -WHAT'S GOING ON, BROTHER? I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR BRINGING ME OVER,  I HAD SO MUCH FUN. WHAT A GREAT WEEK. -WELL, THANK YOU. THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN HAVING YOU OVER HERE, BROTHER. I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TALK TO  YOU GUYS, BECAUSE IF YOU GET LIKE  A LITTLE AIRPLANE AND YOU FLEW THE SHORELINE, YOU CAN SEE WHERE EVERY FISH  IS LANDING, THEY CAN'T HIDE. IT'S GOING TO SAVE YOU  A LOT OF TIME. LIKE WE DO FOR HERRING AND SALMON IN ALASKA? THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.  YEAH. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON MY PRIVATE LICENSE. WE COULD PROBABLY RENT A PLANE IN KONA AND GO OUT AND LOOK FOR FISH. WELL, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THAT A WHIRL NEXT. I LOVE YOU GUYS, MAN.  KEEP ME POSTED ON EVERYTHING, MAN, I'M OUT,  BUT KEEP ME POSTED, OKAY? ALL RIGHT, BROTHER. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. WE'LL GIVE HER A WHIRL, LET YOU KNOW. SEE YOU GUYS. BYE. ALL RIGHT, LOVE YOU. SEE YOU, BROTHER. ¶
