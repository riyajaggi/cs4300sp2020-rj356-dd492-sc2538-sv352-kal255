 THAT'S DEFINITELY HILLSTRAND. COME ON IN, JOHNNY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BROTHER?! BOOM! YEE-HAW! MY NAME IS JOSH HARRIS... BRING IT, BUDDY! ...AND MY DAD WAS CAPTAIN PHIL HARRIS, A LEGEND ON THE BERING SEA. YOU CAN'T GET ANY BETTER [BLEEP] THAN ME. MY DAD WAS A BADASS FISHERMAN. WHEN HE DIED... HE LEFT ME A MYSTERY, CHARTS HE MADE YEARS AGO WHILE EXPLORING HAWAII. BUT I STILL HAVE QUESTIONS, THAT'S FOR SURE.

 THAT'S THE BIGGEST FISH I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, DUDE. IT'S A BIG BOY! THAT'S WHY I CALLED IN ONE OF MY DAD'S BEST FRIENDS... I WANT IN ON THIS ONE. ...JONATHAN HILLSTRAND. BACK UP, BACK UP, BACK UP! BACK THE BOAT UP, DUDE! BACK IT UP. IF JONATHAN HILLSTRAND CAN'T HELP ME SOLVE THE MYSTERIES OF MY DAD'S CHARTS... WE'RE LIVING PHIL'S DREAM. PHIL SHOULD BE HERE WITH US. ...THEN I DON'T KNOW WHO CAN. LET'S GET THE PARTY STARTED. [ LAUGHTER ] OH... CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS ♪ Johnathan: THANKS FOR COMING TO GET ME AT THE AIRPORT. -WELL, YOU KNOW, HEY... -I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO GET UP HERE SO QUICK. -YOU WANT A CUP OF COFFEE? -YEAH, MAN. AWESOME. THIS IS A NICE PAD, MAN. JOHNATHAN HILLSTRAND OWNED AND OPERATED THE TIME BANDIT, SECOND FAMILY TO ME. YEAH, BABY, YEAH. WE LOADED THIS BITCH. HE'S BEEN CONQUERING THE BERING SEA FOR MORE THAN 40 YEARS. YEAH BABY, NO WAY! YEAH, BABY, BABY, BABY, BABY! OH, MAN. YOU CAN TASTE IT. [ SMACKS LIPS ] [ INHALING SHARPLY ] HILLSTRAND HAS MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF AS A COWBOY ON THE WATER DOING THINGS HIS OWN WAY. WE'RE LIKE IN NO MAN'S LAND NOW. WE'RE THE ONLY BOAT OUT HERE FOR MILES AND MILES AND MILES. [ ALL CHEERING ] JOHN AND PHIL HARRIS. CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH. LET'S TAKE A LITTLE PEEKSKI AT THIS. YOU HAVE THE CHART RIGHT HERE? OH, YEAH. PERFECT. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A COUPLE MORE THAN THIS. WE DIDN'T BRING THEM ALL OVER WITH US, BUT THIS IS THE ONE WE'VE MAINLY BEEN WORKING OFF OF. PHIL HARRIS WAS A GREAT FISHERMAN. I LOOKED UP TO HIM. I'VE KNOWN PHIL FOR OVER 35 YEARS. PHIL WAS FIVE OR SIX YEARS OLDER THAN ME. HE WAS LIKE AN OLDER BROTHER, A MENTOR. I KNEW PHIL BEFORE JOSH WAS BORN. WE GO WAY BACK. ♪ SO NOW JOSH IS LIKE ON A VISION QUEST. FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL HIS OLD MAN WAS UP TO OVER HERE, AND HE'S JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE MYSTERY. I GUARANTEE YOU IF HE MADE THESE MARKS, THERE'S A DAMN GOOD REASON FOR THESE MARKS TO BE HERE. IF I WOULD HAVE FOUND THESE CHARTS, I WOULD HAVE HAD TO CHECK IT OUT, TOO. SO THERE'S A SHARK BITE AHI RIGHT HERE, PULLED OUR FIRST BIG AHI, AND IT GOT EATEN BY A SHARK. HEAD FIRST, HEAD FIRST. HEAD TOWARDS ME. HOLY [BLEEP] WHOA, HE PROBABLY GOT HIT BY THE SHARK AND DRUG DOWN. LOOK, HE'S EVEN SHOCKED. THERE'S THE SHARK RIGHT THERE. HE'S BACK. OH, MY GOD. WE GOT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE FISH. VERY ROUGH. WE DON'T WANT TO GO THERE, DO WE? WE ACTUALLY DID IT. LIVING THE DREAM IF YOU ASK ME, MAN. I WANT IN ON THIS ONE. I CAN HELP THEM GET INSIDE PHIL HARRIS' HEAD AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT THIS MYSTERY, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. "LOTS OF BARS!" [ CHUCKLES ] NO, "LOTS OF GOOD BARS!" WITH A CAPITAL "D" IN "GOOD." -BARS. -ISN'T THAT WEIRD? DID YOU EVER COME OVER HERE WITH PHIL? NO. A LOT OF GUYS FROM ALASKA CAME HERE. BACK IN EARLY '80s, WE HAD TWO YEARS WE DIDN'T HAVE KING CRAB. I WENT TO THE EAST COAST. PHIL CAME OVER HERE, AND HE LEFT SOME CHARTS. NOBODY IN THE BERING SEA'S PROBABLY GOT HAWAII CHARTS EXCEPT PHIL. LEAVE IT TO PHIL HARRIS. I'M SURE YOUR DAD KNEW EVERYBODY IN TOWN, SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO TO THOSE BARS, SEE IF HE'S GOT ANY BUDDIES THAT CAN TELL YOU MORE STUFF, BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE FROM THEM OLD-TIMERS OUT HERE. WE SHOULD GO INVESTIGATE, MAYBE. I'M KIND OF IN THE MOOD TO INVESTIGATE A BAR. WE GOT TO HAVE A DUCK FART FOR YOUR DAD. OH, GOD. YEAH. ANOTHER 20 BILLION DUCK FARTS LATER. PHIL, WHEN I LOOK AT THAT CHART MAP, NOW I GUARANTEE PHIL WAS AT EVERY BAR IN THIS WHOLE ISLAND, AND HE TALKED TO EVERYBODY. HE PROBABLY KNEW EVERYBODY ON THE ISLAND. IN FACT, PHIL USED TO SAY, "YOU WANT TO THINK LIKE A FISH? DRINK LIKE A FISH." LET'S GO FIND OUT, MAN. YOU WANT TO SEE THE FLAGSHIP? YEAH. I WANT TO SEE THE SHIP. -GRAB YOUR COFFEE, LET'S ROLL. -OKAY, MAN. BRING YOUR SUNGLASSES. THIS THING'S SHINY. [ CHUCKLES ] Josh: I'M SO PUMPED HILLSTRAND IS HERE. JOHN, HE'S ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT YOU WANT AROUND TO KIND OF HELP FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS. HE ALWAYS KNOWS HOW TO SHAKE THINGS UP. AND TO BE HONEST, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT CASEY AND I NEED. THIS BOAT MAKES THE CORNELIA LOOK SMALL. Johnathan: [ Chuckling ] ARE YOU [BLEEP] KIDDING ME? OH, GOD. ARE YOU GUYS CRAZY? YOU [BLEEP] WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE BEAST? WE'RE GOING TO NEED A BIGGER BOAT. ARE YOU GUYS CRAZY? Johnathan: I SEE THIS LITTLE TINY DINGHY THING ON A TRAILER. I GO, NO, THAT'S NOT THE BOAT. IT'S NOT -- IT'S LIKE A BATHTUB TOY. I HAD BIGGER TOYS IN THE BATHTUB WHEN I WAS A KID. BUT IT'S GOT A CAPTAIN'S CHAIR. ALL RIGHT. THIS THING'S LIKE LITTLE. [BLEEP] -HOW LONG IS THIS BOAT? -19 FEET. 19 FEET, OH, MY GOD. 19 FEET OF FURY. I THINK HE WAS -- I COULD HEAR THE EYE ROLL WHEN HE LOOKED AT THAT BOAT. HE'S LIKE, "YOU SERIOUSLY -- YOU TWO GUYS HAVE BEEN OUT FISHING IN SOMETHING THIS SIZE?" YOU CAN GO 20 MILES OUT IN THIS THING? 25. [ Chuckling ] 25? GOD HELP US. HEY, WE MADE IT BACK EVERY TIME. SEE? NO ONE'S DIED YET, JOHN. I KNOW WHERE HILLSTRAND'S COMING FROM. HIS BOAT, THE TIME BANDIT, IS WELL OVER A HUNDRED FEET LONG. ♪ BLBLBLBLBLBLBL! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! YOU COULD DEFINITELY FIT MORE THAN 10 OF THESE HAWAIIAN BOATS ON JUST THE DECK OF THE CORNELIA MARIE. OH, YEAH! WHOA, YEAH! THIS AIN'T LUXURY, BUT IT'S DEFINITELY GETTING THE JOB DONE. MY DAD WAS PROBABLY USING ONE OF THESE TINY BOATS 30 YEARS AGO. YOU GUYS ARE [BLEEP] CRAZY, [BLEEP] CRAZY, BUT I'M READY TO GO WITH YOU. [ LAUGHS ] WELL, STEP ONE, LET'S GO TALK TO THE LOCALS. IF YOU GO TO A FISHING BAR AND PEOPLE ARE DRINKING, THEY'RE GOING TO SPILL ALL THEIR INFORMATION. THEY'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING THEY KNOW, DUDE. EVEN IF WE DON'T MEET ANYBODY THAT KNOWS PHIL, THAT HUNG OUT WITH PHIL, WE'RE GOING TO GET INFORMATION, MAN. THIS IS LIKE FISHING. FISHING FOR INFORMATION. YES. ALL RIGHT, GUYS. ♪ LOOKING AROUND HERE, AND WHAT DO I SEE? NOTHING BUT GOD'S COUNTRY. IT'S BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE. IT'S PARADISE. THIS PLACE IS -- I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL THE COLORS AND EVERYTHING. THE PLUMERIAS AND... I COULD SEE WHY THE OLD MAN WOULD MAKE HIS WAY OVER HERE. I CAN SEE YOUR DAD WITH THIS JUST BIG [BLEEP] EATING GRIN ON HIS FACE, SMILING BIGGER THAN THE CHESHIRE CAT. I SEE YOUR DAD'S GRIN, IT DESCRIBES THAT PERFECTLY. WE MIGHT EVEN MEET SOMEONE THAT HE KNOWS. YOU KNOW WHAT? I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED, BUT I'D BE LIKE, WHAT THE [BLEEP]? ♪ ♪ IF I WAS MY DAD, I'D BE WALKING DOWN THIS, TOO. BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF COLORS, IT'S BRIGHT AND VIBRANT. THIS PLACE IS AWESOME. YEP, YOUR DAD PROBABLY DID THIS SAME WALK. ♪ I CAN IMAGINE YOUR DAD HANGING OUT DOWN HERE, MAN. DUDE, I COULD, TOO. A LOT OF HAPPY PEOPLE. Johnathan: IT'S A LOT OF FUN HANGING OUT WITH JOSH. HE'S A LOT LIKE PHIL. HE'S GOT THE GIFT OF GAB, BUT HE GABS A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN PHIL DID. DUDE, WE GOT TO FIND OUT THE LOCAL SPOT THAT'S WITHIN THIS AREA, MAN. WE JUST GOT TO FIND PEOPLE THAT LOOK LOCAL AND ASK THEM. TATTOOS, PHIL WOULD GO GET A TATTOO. THAT'S PERFECT. Johnathan: PILL HAD LIKE A SHIRT ON, TATTOOS. HE HAD, I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T EVEN COUNT. I SAY OVER 50. HE HAD THIS PIRATE DONE, AND IT LOOKED JUST LIKE HIM. THAT'S WHAT I THINK HIS FAVORITE ONE WAS, THE TATTOO OF HIMSELF AS A PIRATE. TATTOO. TATTOOS, THE OLD MAN WOULD DEFINITELY BE INTO THIS. TATTOO ARTISTS ARE MY DAD'S STYLE OF PEOPLE, SO I BET YOU THEY COULD RECOMMEND A GOOD BAR TO CHECK OUT. BUT MY DAD, HE WAS A FISHERMAN, HE DIED ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO. WE FOUND THESE CHARTS, OLD CHARTS, KIND OF CRAZY STUFF, AND ALL THESE PLACES WERE OUTLINED FOR FISHING, AND THEN THERE WAS A CIRCLE OF GOOD BARS. BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT PLACES, KIND OF RELIVING THE MOMENT. SAM'S HIDEAWAY? THAT'S THE SPOT? OKAY. ALL RIGHT. BOOM! -YOU SECOND THAT? -YEAH. THAT WAS COOL AS HELL. DUDE, LOOK, IT'S A GROUP OF HOT CHICKS. THEY DEFINITELY KNOW WHERE TO GO. HEY, DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHERE ANY GOOD BARS ARE AROUND HERE? -A DIVE BAR? -YEAH. THERE'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD DIVE BAR RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. -SAM'S. -SAM'S? SOUNDS LIKE WE FOUND A GOOD BAR, AND WE JUST SO HAPPENED TO BE LOOKING FOR A GOOD BAR. ♪ Johnathan: SAM'S HIDEAWAY IS WHERE WE NEED TO GO. THAT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE SAID EARLIER. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SPOT. YOU GUYS WANT TO GO IN THERE AND GET DRINK? -YEAH, HELL YEAH. -LET'S DO IT. IN IT TO WIN IT. LET'S DO IT, BOYS. LOOK AT THESE BIKES. LOOK AT THIS, THAT SAYS PHIL HARRIS. [ ENGINES REVVING ] ♪ WE'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE ALREADY. THIS HAS PHIL WRITTEN ALL OVER IT. BIKES OUTSIDE. SURPRISED I DIDN'T SEE HIM WHEN I WALKED IN THERE. HE WASN'T THERE, BUT HIS AURA WAS THERE. Casey: THIS PLACE HAS BEEN HERE SINCE THE '80s. THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE PHIL DID COME HERE. ♪ TO PHIL! WHAT'S UP, MAN? HOW YOU BEEN? -YES, SIR. -RIGHT ON. YOU MET MY DAD, DIDN'T YOU? YES. ♪ J.D.: RIGHT ON. AND A COUPLE YEARS AGO... -WITH MARIO? -YEAH. WITH MARIO. -YEAH. -YOU MET MY DAD, DIDN'T YOU? YES. HEY, JOHN. MY DAD WAS HERE. HE HAS HIS SHIRT HANGING UP IN THE OFFICE AT THE HARLEY DAVIDSON PLACE. HILLSTRAND HAD THIS GRANDIOSO IDEA OF HITTING THE LOCAL BARS. I ACTUALLY NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD PAY OFF. AND THEN I RUN INTO SOMEBODY THAT MET MY FATHER 30 YEARS AGO. I GUESS WE'RE THE RIGHT PLACE AFTER ALL. DUDE. THIS IS FUN, LIKE, TALKING TO THESE GUYS. ONE THING IS WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR FISHING. -HEY GUYS. -HOW ARE YOU? WHAT'S UP MY MAN? YEAH. I'M CASEY. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? MY NAME'S BRIAN. BRIAN? -YEAH. -NICE. THERE YOU GO. HEY, MAN, WHAT'S UP? SO I FISH FOR BLUE MARLIN EVERY SINGLE YEAR FOR BIG MONEY HERE. WHAT'S THE BIGGEST ONE YOU EVER CAUGHT? MY DAD FISHED IN ALASKA. HE PASSED AWAY. WE'RE ON THE 10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY. MY DAD ALWAYS WANTED TO CATCH A MARLIN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HE'S GOING TO STAB ME? WHEN WE CAME HERE, WE ALREADY KNEW THAT FISHING IN HAWAII WAS NO JOKE, BUT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE FISH HERE WERE GOING TO BE CAPABLE OF KILLING YOU. FISHING IN ALASKA IS TOUGH, BUT AT LEAST THE CRAB DON'T FIGHT BACK. -A THOUSAND BUCKS. -A THOUSAND BUCKS. -NO. -POUNDAGE. CASH MONEY! REAL HANDSHAKE. -NO [BLEEP] -NO [BLEEP] LET'S LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT CASEY'S THE ONE THAT MADE THIS BET TO SEE WHICH TEAM COMES BACK WITH THE MOST POUNDAGE. -POUND IT ON THE POUNDAGE. -WE'RE POUNDING ON THE POUNDAGE. JOSH AND I ALWAYS COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER, AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, COMPETITION'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE NEED TO DO A DUCK FART. -CHEERS, BOYS. -WE NEED TO DO A DUCK FART. -FOR PHIL? -TIMEOUT. [BLEEP] WE GOT TO DO A DUCK FART. SORRY. I MEAN, DUCK FART FOR PHIL. PHIL'S FAVORITE DRINK IS A DUCK FART. IT'S KAHLUA, BAILEY'S, AND CROWN ROYAL. AND THEY'RE RAUNCHY, THEY'RE TERRIBLE. LOVE YOU [BLEEP] WE GOT 35 DUCK FARTS! Casey: ALL RIGHT. PASS THEM OVER, GUYS. PASS THEM OVER. GET OVER HERE PEOPLE, COME ON. YOU'RE GETTING A DOUBLE DUCK FART. Man: I DON'T KNOW HOW HE EVEN TALKS US INTO IT. IT IS THE WORST TASTING THING IN YOUR LIFE. DUCK FARTS ARE GOOD, MAN. [ LAUGHS ] 15, 16 YEARS AGO, NO ONE KNEW HOW TO MAKE A DUCK FART. AND PHIL, HE LOVED TO SAY, "YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE A DUCK FART?" AND THEY'D GO, "NO." AND HE SAID, "WELL, YOU SQUEEZE HIM." ONE MORE TIME FOR YOU. "YOU SQUEEZE HIM." [ LAUGHS ] I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY THAT'S HERE. I FOUND OUT A LOT OF STUFF ABOUT MY DAD I DIDN'T KNOW. COME TO FIND OUT FISHING OUT HERE IS PROBABLY HARDER THAN FISHING IN ALASKA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -I LOVE YOU, GUYS. -TO CAPTAIN PHIL! TO CAPTAIN PHIL! [ ALL CHEERING ] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ TODAY IS A SPECIAL DAY FOR ME. I GET TO FISH WITH A LEGENDARY FISHERMEN, JOHN HILLSTRAND. CASEY AND JEFF THINK THEY'RE GOING TO LAND MORE FISH THAN US. IT'S DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. Casey: WHAT UP, JEFF? JEFF. JOHNNY HILLSTRAND. -WHAT'S UP, JOHNATHAN? -GOOD TO MEET YOU, MAN. -ALOHA, MY MAN. -I'M GOING TO SHOW HILLSTRAND HOW THIS FISHING OPERATION WORKS HERE IN HAWAII, AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS BET.

CASEY AND JEFF ARE GOING TO GO TO THEIR CUTE LITTLE SPOT THAT THEY HAVE THERE CALLED, "WHO CARES?" JOHNNY AND I ARE GOING TO GO CHECK OUT A LITTLE SPOT MARKED ON THE CHART CALLED MARLIN STRIKE. WE LEARNED LAST NIGHT THAT MARLIN CAN GET WELL OVER A THOUSAND POUNDS, AND THIS BET IS ALL ABOUT POUNDAGE. SO WE'RE GOING FOR A MARLIN TODAY. JOHN HILLSTRAND'S ONE THE MOST COMPETITIVE FISHERMEN IN THE BERING SEA.

POSITIONING, POSITIONING, TIMING. IF YOU CAN PUT THE RIGHT BAIT IN FRONT OF THE RIGHT FISH AT THE RIGHT TIME, IT'S GOING TO BITE. JEFF SILVA IS A TOTAL BADASS. THE GUY KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. HE'S TALENTED, HE'S A HARD WORKER, HE'S DRIVEN, AND HE'S VERY SUCCESSFUL. OH, YOU [BLEEP] ♪ THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD THAT HAVE THAT DRIVE WHEN IT COMES TO FISHING.

THEY'RE PROBABLY THE WORST FISH, BY THE BOAT, THAT YOU CAN HAVE. THEY'LL SPEAR YOU. THEY'LL STAB YOUR BOAT. THEY'LL JUMP IN YOUR BOAT AND JUST DESTROY EVERYTHING.

SO, IF THEY DO HAVE A BIG FISH ON, THEY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION AND AS THAT FISH GETS CLOSER TO THE BOAT... I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR PLAN IS. FISH ON YOUR LINE. IT ONLY COUNTS IF IT'S IN THE BOAT. OTHERWISE, IT'S JUST A STORY. BUT IT DOES LOOK GOOD OUT HERE. THERE'S SOME BIRDS STARTING TO FLY AROUND, STARTING TO SEE SOME BAIT SKIPPING ON THE SURFACE.
