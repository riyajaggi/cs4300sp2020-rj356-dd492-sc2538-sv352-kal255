I know anything you'll say will merely be in service of saving your daughter. No. [laughs] I want you to think... [laughing] about your response. I want you to feel the noose of incarceration tightening around your neck. Then and only then do I want your answer. You hate me. But in time, you'll see-- just as many before you have-- that beyond hatred lies salvation. Your daughter is upstairs in her room unharmed. She knows nothing about this. She simply believes she was caught skipping school. The less she knows, the better, in case your decision is one that pleases me. Good-bye, Erica.

I'm Anthony Cabrera. - This is Agent Zain. - Pleasure. - I worked with Laine. I'm sorry. We're in here. Thank you so much for coming, Agent Keaton. I know our two agencies haven't always worked well together in the past, but four of our people are dead. And we're willing to do anything in our power to find those responsible. - Tell us what you know. - [clears throat] The separate attacks were definitely coordinated. All three happened within 30 minutes of one another. - Any indication that Tal's operatives were in communication with each other? - Not at this moment, no, but we're still waiting on signals intelligence from the NSA. - How did Tal find them? - Truth is, we don't know. But we have a theory. It's not uncommon for foreign intelligence agencies to monitor our operatives when they're abroad. - Our bureau does the same thing here in the States. - Exactly. We think that Tal may have exploited these agencies in an effort to locate our people. We think that's how he found them and how he was able to take them out so quickly. - Okay, so you've told us where and you've told us how, but you still haven't told us why these four operatives were targeted by Mikhail Tal. - Retaliation. These four operatives were part of a team that in 2015 stopped the bombing of 20 passenger planes that were US-bound. They saved thousands of people. - And he killed them because of that? - Yes. - Who knew about this team? - Uh, a handful of analysts, systems technicians, and, uh, senior operations managers. - We're gonna need a complete list of all those names by the end of the day. - Cabrera can help you with that. [suspenseful music] ♪ Agent Keaton. I am sorry for your loss. - Only a handful of people at the CIA knew the identities of the four operatives killed at the recent attacks. Tal had to have gotten the names from one of them. These are the 12 people. These are our suspects. Let's go to work. [dramatic music] ♪ - Keaton? - What, you got something? - Robert Lennon checks out. From the beginning, he's been claiming that he had no knowledge of Brian Lanich's whereabouts the day of the attack. I just got confirmation that he was telling the truth. He couldn't have done it. - That's her. Erica Shepherd. She's the one that's working with Tal. - Whoa, wait. Look, we don't have it yet. We don't have enough evidence. You confront her now, you risk her conviction. We'll get it, Will. We have to do this by the book. - I will. - Where are you going? ♪ - Just wanna talk to her. [soft music] ♪ [soft indistinct chatter] Thomas. Nia. It's good to see you guys. - You, too, Will. - We miss you. You don't come by the house anymore. - I know. I'm sorry. I've been a little busy. - You can still visit, you know. That hasn't changed. - Appreciate that. Saved these seats for you guys. - You know how this is gonna work? - Yeah, well the, uh, director's gonna get up and he's gonna say a few words.

They give me a star. ♪ - Can you, uh, excuse me for a minute, please? Erica Shepherd. - Agent Keaton. How have you been? - I've been better. So I was wondering, um, how's the progress on the Tal investigation? Any closer to catching him? - I'm sorry, I can't say. Are you still heading up the investigation for the FBI? - I am. Sorry, can't say. Though there has been some talk. Nothing official, just gossip among family members. - What kind of gossip? - A little bit of everything. Some people think that he was working with the Russians. Others think that he was working with an American. In fact, some think from the CIA. - Hmm. And what do you think? - I think that whoever it is should be worried. 'Cause sooner or later, I'm gonna find them. - I'm confident that you will. ♪ . [soft music] - It's time to go to bed. - What? - I have to be at work early in the morning and I'm not gonna be rushed like I was today. It is time to go to bed. - Okay. - Did you do your homework? - I forgot. I'll do it in the morning. I'll wake up early. I promise. - Hannah, you are 13 years old. Can you explain to me why I'm telling you to go to bed at night, asking you if you've brushed your teeth, and I'm dragging you out of bed every morning? - I'm sorry. - Sorry isn't an answer! And sorry is not gonna cut it in the real world! You have got to start taking care of yourself! ♪ [sighs] ♪ I'm sorry. I'm exhausted. You have got to start taking care of yourself.

Hannah! ♪ [beeps] - Don't say your name. Don't say who you're calling for. Just give me the first three-digit code you were sent. - BQR. - The second three-digit code. - 7RK. - One moment. [beeps] - Hello? Hello? - Hello, Erica. - Tal? - I must admit that I didn't think I would hear your voice again. What is it you want from me? - Three years ago you made me an offer. - What of it? - I want to know if it still stands. - Three years ago, you were in a position to help me. - I still am. The FBI, William Keaton. He's closing in on you. I know you feel it. I can help you. ♪ - Why? After all these years, why would you do this now? - I am not going to die in a cage.
