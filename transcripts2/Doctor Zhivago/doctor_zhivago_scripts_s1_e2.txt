 [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] [YELLING] [WHISTLE BLOWING, CHORUS SINGING SONG IN RUSSIAN] [SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN] Yes? Hello, I'm Dr. Zhivago. This is my home. Comrade Demina! Yes, it's all right. I'll deal with it. Yury? Oh!

 I had forgotten how beautiful you are. I'm so sorry about that stupid letter. It's all over now. I'm home. No lice from the train? It doesn't matter. So happy to see you. Can I help you? Other way around, comrade... I think you'll find. Yury, this is Comrade Demina. She lives here now. She's in charge of accommodation... for the whole area. Come in and see Sasha.

 He's such a big boy now. TONYA: We are in there. It's really very cozy. We have our own stove and everything. YURY: How many people actually live here? There's 6 families. Comrade Demina's very good to us. We have two whole rooms to ourselves. You know, mostly, it's one family in a room. We are very lucky. But I'm so afraid... of Sasha picking up something. There's typhus in the slums. Shh. Here he is, my big boy. Look, Sasha. It's your papa. Sasha. Sasha. Hello. Do you remember me? Sasha! Why did you do that? It's your papa. YURY: Tonya, don't yell. Yury? Good to have you home, dear boy. Hmm. Misha Gordon... Director of Holy Cross Hospital. So, how did you do it? Joined the party. Went to all the meetings. Spoke at all the meetings. By the way... it's the Second Reform Hospital now, all right? Yury, you have to understand... I can't do you any favors. I'm not expecting any favors. I just want to work. Tonya tells me there's a typhus epidemic. Oh! There is no typhus epidemic. There is a lot of irresponsible... anti-government propaganda. It's essential that the people... get the right information. I want to put you in charge of statistics. It's probably the most important task of all. Staff efficiency level of political consciousness... More important than treating the sick? Misha, we didn't go in for medicine... to fill in forms and spy on our colleagues. Come on. This is a joke, isn't it? You're still writing your poetry? Yes. Of course. I should keep it to yourself... if I were you. By the way, from now on... it's Comrade Director... and Comrade Dr. Zhivago, all right? Of course, Comrade Director. You'll get used to it. [DISTANT YELLING] [LOW MOANING] Shh. [LABORED BREATHING] Help me. Help me. MAN: Comrade Zhivago! The meeting began 14 minutes ago. The Director says you must come immediately. With pleasure. MAN: What about us? MISHA: Late again, Comrade Zhivago. What's your excuse this time? There's a typhus epidemic in the hospital. C Ward must be isolated immediately. What are you trying to do to me? I'm trying to do my job. I say what your job is, not you. I won't have you spreading panic. Don't you know that's a capital offense? I'm simply telling the truth, Misha. Yury... Yury... you've be recommended for reeducation. What? I can't protect you anymore. You want my advice; Take your family and leave Moscow. Go as far as you can, and keep your head down when you get there. I don't want to leave Moscow. This is my home. There's work for me to do here. More than I can cope with. You know that. What do you want to do? Do you want to practice medicine in Siberia? Think about Tonya... if you are too noble to think about yourself. You and your principles. You don't deserve that lovely girl. [GUNFIRE] [DISTANT YELLING IN RUSSIAN] OLYA: Good evening, Comrade Doctor. I see you're getting the hang of things. You know, I could turn you in for that. Scavenging is forbidden. It's all right. Any friend of Lara's is a friend of mine. Lara Antipova? You know Lara? I used to sew dresses in her mother's workshop. Is she all right? She's back in Yuryatin, in the Urals. She mentioned me to you? When next I write... I'll tell her you were asking after her shall I? TONYA: Yury? [CAT MEOWING] Yury? TONYA: So, what are we going to do? Well, there's always the Varykino estate... it belonged to your mother's father... before it was confiscated. It's been empty for years... but we could open it up again, perhaps. -Varykino? -Uh-huh. I always want to see it. Where is it, exactly? It's in the Urals. Hard to describe. It's very remote. The nearest town is Yuryatin. Yuryatin? They didn't name it for you, you know. [LAUGHING] But I think it's a good omen. We can grow vegetables and support ourselves. Better than starve here... dying like sheep without a struggle. Mm-hmm. Yes. Huh? This way! This... this way! [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] [YELLING] [PEOPLE YELLING IN RUSSIAN] ALEXANDER: Excellent. If you see a steward... will you ask him to bring me... a brandy and soda, Tonya? SASHA: Are we going really fast? YURY: I think we are. Or perhaps we're standing still... and it's the world that's whizzing past us. Ugh! Ah! MAN: Don't worry, my boys. Shove them! All right, little one. I won't let him get you. Any trouble from them... bang, bang! Don't worry, sir, I'll introduce them. Here's little Vassya, my pride and joy. Hey! Get back! Ugh! What did you do? Nothing. It was my uncle. He was arrested. He asked for a moment to say good-bye to my aunt... but he never came back... so they took me. Why don't you let the boy go? I can't! He cried his eyes out at first... but he's fine now, aren't you? Well, at least you could take the chains off. It's not as if he's going anywhere, is it? Well, madam... just for you. Eat. [BABY CRYING] [HORSE WHINNYING] [WOMAN CRYING] ALEXANDER: What happened, friend? Strelnikov! Who's Strelnikov? He's killing anyone who supports the czar! [WOMAN CRYING] His armored train is just up the line there! What had you done? MAN: Nothing. It was our neighbors... who sold horses to the Whites... so we got it as well. WOMAN: Please! Bread, bread. GUARD: He's not a man like you or me, Strelnikov. He's a force of nature. He's the angel of death. Excuse me. What's happening? Orders from up ahead. We have to wait. How long? [WOMAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [BIRDS CHIRPING] I know this place. There's Briski village! I lived there before I came to Moscow! Ha ha! That's my river. They keep following the river. That's my village! That's where my mother lives... and my two little sisters. Bless you. Go. Go. [WHISTLES] [GUNFIRE] No! No! No! [MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Comrade Strelnikov, we've got him. STRELNIKOV: Good. Bring him through. This isn't the man. In fact, it looks nothing like him. My apologies, Comrade. They mistook you for someone else. You are free to go. Just a minute. Let me see your papers. Zhivago? Please, sit down. So, you're a doctor, are you? Yes. You used to be a poet. I still am. Mmm. Extraordinary. I heard you read once, you know. Things we do when we are young. Poetry readings. Where are you going? I'm traveling with my family... to Varykino. It's near Yuryatin. Yes, I know where it is. I have a wife and child in Yuryatin... well, I had. I haven't seen them since the war. What does that matter, hmm? The private life, love, and so on. It's all dead and gone now. Don't you agree? We have more important things to do. In any case, it was always a delusion. It's the only thing... that makes life worth living. That's a very subversive notion. There was a young boy outside. All he wanted was to get back to his family... and your men shot him like a rabbit. Why? Individual deaths don't matter. Have you killed many people, Dr. Zhivago? I've killed thousands. Enemies of the revolution. Good men with mistaken ideas, a lot of them. The end justifies the means. Does it? Perhaps I should have you shot after all. However, I said you were free... and I don't break my word. This time I'll let you go. Next time may be different. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] Yury! Yury! ALEXANDER: Yury, Hurry! Hurry! Yury! Yury! Yury! Yury, hurry! Yury! Yury! Hurry! Help him! Come on! Come on! Come on! Please, please, please, let him be. Tonya. I met Strelnikov. It's all right. Where's Vassya, Papa? Come here, my boy. Come here. He went home. He went home. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [HORSE WHINNIES] MAN: Alexander Alexandrovich. Dr. Zhivago. You see, you were expected. My advice, set yourselves up in the cottage. You can live well there without servants. Anyway, best not to draw too much attention, huh? Modest local doctor very welcome. Lord of the manor... that doesn't go down so well anymore. ALEXANDER: Ha ha. [BUZZING] YURY: Look, Sasha. [LAUGHING] MAN: In any case... another doctor's always welcome in this town. Until Monday, then. Be good to have you on board. [COUGHING] [CHICKENS CLUCKING] [COW MOOING] Zhivago. Put your buckets down. I'll carry them for you. No. You'd only spill them and splash the stairs. I didn't think you'd come. You've been in Varykino a whole year. You knew? Of course. Things get around. I saw you in the library. Why didn't you speak to me? Don't tell me you didn't see me. I keep the key up there when I go out. Give me your hand. It's dark inside. Listen, you could turn around... walk down the stairs, and go home. No... I can't. No... I don't want you to. LARA: Read it again. It's beautiful. Come in, then. Come and show me. Mm-hmm. And behind your ears? Ha. Clean as a new pen. You go on. Give Yury a kiss. Go on. Good night, Yury. Good night. Will you be here in the morning? Yes. When's Daddy coming home? I don't know, darling. Go on. Night, night. Sweet dreams. When I tried to go and see him when he came to Yuryatin... when his ADC asked me what my business was... I said personal... and they wouldn't let me in. You still love him, don't you? I married him. If Strelnikov turned into Pasha... if he wanted me back... I would go to him. No... No, I don't mean that. I love you. What is it? What's wrong with you? Did something happen in town? Tell me. You'll know you'll feel better... when you've told me. [BREATHES HEAVILY] [HORSE WHINNIES] [HOOF BEATS] [THUNDERING] [CRYING] [YURY SIGHS] I have to tell her. I know. But when you do... [SNIFFLES] Don't say it. I'll be fine. No, don't. I'll be fine. No, don't. Don't. [CRYING] Oh! [HORSE WHINNYING] Don't move, Doctor. We are conscripting you... into the Partisan battalion of the Red Army. Yah! Yah! Whoa. Dr. Zhivago. I'm sorry we had to kidnap you. Our surgeon was killed last week. If you obey orders, Doctor... you will not be harmed. If not... [LAUGHTER] Will you get word to my wife of... what's happened to me? And your mistress? [LAUGHTER] [HORSE WHINNIES] Charge! [YELLING] Now! [GUNFIRE] Fire! Fire! Fire! [GROANS] [YELLING] [HORSE WHINNYING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Look... they're sending children against us now. A picture of his mama. He's too young to have a girlfriend. Breaks your heart. Yes. Medicinal. [DISTANT GUNSHOT] On we go! To the east! You see... they do the same to our children. Do you have children, Doctor? Yes, I have. [HEAVY BREATHING] Aah! Are you the midwife? I'm sorry. There was no one else... but they begged me to come. The midwife's on another case... but don't worry. This one was a nurse in the war. Thank God you're here. [LABORED BREATHING] You're doing very well. It will soon be over. You'll have a beautiful new baby... to show your family. [HEAVY BREATHING] My husband... he won't see his child. What do you mean? Ugh. The Partisans took him. Perhaps I'll never see him again. Oh, God! What happened? [TONYA CRYING] It's only nature, Sasha. Ugh! Yury... He will come back. He will find a way back. I'm sure of it. Who are you? Are you from Moscow? What's your name? Larissa Antipova. [SCREAMING] [CHILDREN GIGGLING] So why did you bring your family... with you, Palyk? Papa. I couldn't leave them behind. When the Whites take a village... what they do isn't worth thinking about. You really think they'll be safer here? I tell myself that... but then I think; What if I get shot? Papa. What should I do with him? Eat him. Eat him? Yeah. [LAUGHING] The trouble is... you love them too much, don't you? [GIGGLING] [HORSE WHINNIES] [STAGGERED BREATHING] Help me! Help. Help me. How many were there, Comrade? Comrade, listen to me. When did they leave? When did they leave? When did they leave? -Aah! -Listen to me, Comrade. How long ago did they leave? Comrade... Help me! Help. How many were there, Comrade? The doctor will help you. He'll give you something to kill the pain, but I need to know. How long ago did they leave? Comrade. Give him some morphine! What are you waiting for? I can't help him! There's nothing left. Do you understand? You finished the last yourself! [GUNFIRE] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [YELLING] All over now, Doctor. They are safe now. No one can get them now. [HORSE WHINNIES] [GUNSHOT] [YELLING] Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! [BELLS RINGING] [BABY CRYING] [BELL RINGS] I found myself wondering what it was like... your place. Now I see it. I don't know whether I am glad or not. Would you sit down? [BABY WHINES] I came to tell you... that we are leaving Varykino. My father has been asked... to come back to the University of Moscow. You must be very gratified. In any case... I don't want to stay in Varykino. I thought I was happy there. Happier than I have ever been. And it was all a lie. I hate it there now. Tonya, you mustn't think like that. Don't tell me what I must think. Oh, the fool I was... thinking I had a husband who loved me... thinking I was happy... when all the time he was thinking of you. He couldn't wait to get out of the house... and get away from us to lie in your arms... in your bed. Why couldn't you leave him alone? It wasn't like that. The last time I saw him... was to be the last time ever. He was on his way back to tell you everything... and to say that he would never see me again. Truly? Truly. He always loved you, Tonya. But not enough. I don't want his noble sacrifice. Do you think I'd be happy... watching him doing his noble suffering... lying awake at night thinking of you... writing his poems about you? I'd rather be dead. I just wish you'd never set eyes on him. Do you have a husband? Does he know about your life? Does he care? His name's Strelnikov. Strelnikov? Strelnikov is your husband? Was my husband. Now I don't know. [BABY CRIES] What I came to say... if Yury comes back alive... he'll come to you, I'm sure. If he does... [BABY CRIES LOUDLY] Tell him I shall always love him... but I don't want him back... if he's still in love with you... [BABY CRYING] Only if he chooses to come. Only if he chooses me. Otherwise, we shall be better without him. [MAN SINGING IN RUSSIAN] [HEAVY BREATHING] [BELL RINGING] [HEAVY BREATHING] [GASP] [THUD] L... Shh. This wild man from the East... what should we do with him? Do you remember Yury? Yes! Of course. [GIGGLING] He should have his hair cut. Oh, my darling. I thought we'd lost you. Come here. [SNIFFING] She came with your baby. I admire her very much, you know. Tonya has pride, and she's... she's very brave. She loves you so much. I know. She's a much better person than I am. You should go back to her. I don't deserve you. Lara, don't say that. I don't think I could love you so much... if you had nothing to regret. Don't go yet, Yury. It's so dangerous everywhere now. They're shooting people if they don't like the look of their faces. You're a fugitive from the partisans. Stay with me. Stay with me for a while. Until everything gets better. Ha-ha-ha! [GROWLING] Look at that mad man. Oh, quick, he's gonna get us! [GROWLING] Quick, run, he's getting us! [TRAIN WHISTLE] Welcome to Yuryatin, Comrade Minister Komarovsky. Oh God. Yury! What a hell hole this town is. Larissa, as lovely as ever. You know I thought perhaps the spell... had broken, but no, some things never change. It's been a long time. What are you doing here? What do you want? Would you get us some glasses, my dear? I hope we can be friends. We're civilized men, after all. You and I can never be friends. We do have one thing in common though, don't we? It's very nice here. It's very... very cozy. A little nest of love. What a shame. Please say what you have to say and then leave. Sit down with me, at least. Come on, it won't hurt you. Do you know how much the authorities hate you... Yury Andreyevich? You live like an individual... with no concern for the party. How do you think that makes the apparatchiks feel? I don't care how they feel. You might care... about what they're intending to do with you. As for you, my dear... to be the lover of this man... would be enough to condemn you. But you are also the wife of Strelnikov... and you're being watched. Now that the Whites are beaten... his usefulness is over. Can't afford to let him live. He'll be hunted down and executed. They might be more merciful with you: 10 years in the camps, perhaps. Your names are on the list. I've seen them. You should seriously think about saving yourselves. Which brings me to the point. I shall be traveling to Vladivostok very soon. It's an important posting... and I can take you both with me... and the child. Naturally, I'd prefer to just take Larissa and the child... and leave you behind, but I don't suppose... she'll agree to that arrangement. No, I won't. Do you really think I'd agree to live... and travel under your protection? That's not what I'm offering. I'm offering to save your life... for Larissa's sake. Once we get to Vladivostok... You can... go and join your family... or whatever you wish. But Lara stays with me. Now, let's talk of happier matters. I'm so glad to see you again. You've said what you came to say. Now leave. Yury Andreyevich... I've come all this way to save your lives. Is that friendly? Please go now, Victor. But it's late. Aren't you going to offer me a bed for the night? Get out. As you wish, my darling. VICTOR: I'll be waiting. He's right. You should go with him. It's too dangerous here. Don't make me choose that... even for Katya's sake. Come with us. I can't bear to think of you and him together. You mustn't be jealous of him, Yury. I never loved him. And I despise him now. Do you really know yourself... as well as that? Hatred can be stronger than love. He was the man... who ruined my father. Drove him to suicide. So what do we do? Lara... Lara, let's go to Varykino. No one will look for us there in winter. If they don't see us, they won't care about us. I'm sure of it. Mikulitsin would lend us his mare. And if it's true... that our days are really numbered... then let us spend them together. Let us spend them together in the best way. Say good-bye to each other in the best way. I know it's utter madness. But let's be mad... if there's nothing else left to us. 1... 2... 3... Go right now! [LAUGHING] Katya, come on, race! He's going to beat us! Will he go without us? Yeah. Jump on! Ooh, ooh, no! [LAUGHING] LARA: Look, Katya, look at the house! [GIGGLING] LARA: Princess Katranka! Take this. LARA: Stand back, Katya. YURY: Yah! Aw. Mama, I'm hungry. Yury? This is all the food we've got left. I know. What are we going to do? I have an idea. How many candles are left? Hmm? Whoa. Whoa. Someone's coming! [BELLS JANGLING] [HORSE WHINNIES] Lara! [WHINNIES] Yah, yah! Katya! Katya! [BELLS JANGLING] [LOUD WHINNYING] It's time to stop playing around now. My train leaves today for the East. There will never be an offer like this again. Lara, you must go. You must go and take Katya. No, I'm not going without you. You can imagine how eager I am... for your company, Dr. Zhivago... but I ask you to reconsider... for Larissa's sake. Go with him. Stay alive. I'll find you. I'll find you again, I promise. May I have a word with you, Zhivago... in private? If you must. You write poems for her, how nice. I wish I had time to read them. I'm told you have great talent. Now listen. I couldn't say this... in front of Lara and the child. Strelnikov is dead. He was captured last night and shot. Now if Lara stays, she'll be shot, too. That is a certainty. I've seen the warrant. I don't blame you for refusing my help. We all have our sticking points. Would you agree to deceive her... for her sake and for Katya's? She must think you are coming, too. A little white lie. Would you do that? Would you help me save her life? You don't save lives; You destroy them. I knew that about you the first time... that I saw you. Why are you doing this? You must know that she hates you. She despises you. Everything about you disgusts her. Well, of course that is what she would say to you. It's the truth. It's the truth, and you know it. Well, perhaps it is. But don't you know? I would have her under any terms at all. But you'll never really have her. She'll never be yours. Come... there's no time to lose. Yury Andreyevich has changed his mind. Are you coming with us? I'm coming. I'll lock up the house, and I'll follow you. No, we should all go together. There's no room. And besides, what about the horse? If we were to leave it behind... the wolves would take her. Go, go on. You will come, won't you? I'm coming, Lara. I promise you. Yeah. Right. Go. VICTOR: We can go. [FOOTSTEPS] Lara, my wife. Where is she? [TRAIN WHISTLE] [MAN SHOUTING] Ah, Malekov, thank you. You remember Jack, I'm sure. [WHISTLE] This is his son. His name's Bubby. [MAN SHOUTING] Yury! No, no, Lara. Sit down. Sit down. Everything's arranged. It wasn't safe for him to come into town, so... he'll meet us a little further up the line. If all goes well. Oh, God, Yury. Now, Lara... It will be just like old times. No. I'm carrying his child. [TRAIN WHISTLE] Everything. Everything I did... Everything I did was for her... for her sake. I wanted to make a world... where no one could do what that man did to her. I wanted to make a world where innocence... and virtue were... compulsory. All I did was spread a lot more misery. Waste a few thousand lives. And after everything... I'm hunted like an animal... and the Komarovskys of this world... are still running it for their own pleasure. Strelnikov. Strelnikov. I used to be Antipov. Little Pasha Antipov. She's gone, is she? I wish I could have seen her... just once more. Do you have any idea... how much she loved you? What makes you say that? Because she told me herself. She said this? She said this? She said this to you? Yes. She loved me? She loved me. Very good. Excellent. It is not enough. Never enough. Yes, well... I better let you go to bed now. Go on. You go. Thank you for listening to me. By the way, are these your poems? Yes. Mind if I look at them? I'd be honored. Good night, then. [GUNSHOT] [TRAIN WHISTLE] [TRAIN BRAKES SQUEAKING] [CHATTER IN RUSSIAN] WOMAN: Comrade. Dr. Zhivago! I thought you would be in Paris. I'm in Moscow to look for my wife. Is she here? Do you know where she's living? So you never heard? She wrote to you. She told me that she never heard back. I never received her letter. She left her last letter with me... in case you ever turned up. [BELL RINGING] [CHILDREN CHATTERING] TONYA, VOICE-OVER: "My dear Yury"... "It feels so strange to be writing this to you... "not knowing whether you are dead or alive. "Do you know that we have a little daughter? We have christened her Masha, in memory of your mother." "Yury, we are being deported. "My father has fallen out of favor. "I don't know whether they will let you come, too... "or if you want to come or even if you are alive. "But I must believe you are and hope... that you receive this and come to find us one day." ALEXANDER: Tonya. Yes, yes, one minute. TONYA, VOICE-OVER: "God keep you. I must stop." "They are here." "I must pray that we shall all be safe..." "But it feels... as if they had come to take us to our death." "Oh, Yury." "Good-bye, my love. Good-bye." "Let me make the sign of the cross over you..." "And bless you for all the years ahead." "I am not blaming you for anything. "Make your life as you wish. "Only that you are all right. Tonya." [BABY WHIMPERS] [MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] ALEXANDER: No, no, no. No, no need for that. A little dignity, gentlemen, please. [SHOUTING] [GIGGLING] [SIGHS] Help me, Misha. They won't let me leave the country. You could put a word in for me. Help me. Help me to get back to Tonya. You can't make a woman happy... with half your love. Don't you know that yet? Let her go, Yury. [SNIFFS AND SIGHS] She's better off without you. You know what? I loved her all my life. And I never laid a finger on her. [SIGHS] Let me take a look at you. What are you doing, Misha? Stop it. Breathe deeply. [INHALES DEEPLY] [EXHALES DEEPLY] I'm surprised you could walk in here. Your heart is gone. Your lungs are like old paper bags. I'll write you a certificate. You can have a disability pension. I don't want a disability pension. I want to do the only things I can do. I want to work as a doctor... and write poetry. [CHUCKLES] After all this, you still write poems. [CHUCKLES] What about? The world. Love. Particular people. How extraordinary it all is. What a gift it is to be alive in the world... and to know you're alive. Ahh. Let me see your arm. It's better. [WHISPERING] Lara. Yes. Some people called her Larissa. What was she like? Well, I... I try to say that in the poems. You do it very well. Do you think you'll ever see her again? No. [COUGHING] [INDISTINCT TALKING] LARA: Yury. Yury. Yury! Oh! Oh! [MAN CHUCKLING] [SOBBING SOFTLY] He was your father. I know. MISHA: Excuse me. Lara? Yes. I was Yury's best friend. I came to Moscow to try to find him. But I understood you were... Living with Victor Komarovsky. Yes. But in the end, I got away from him. He won't be coming after me again. These are yours. His poems. We're all in there... all our lives... all these terrible times. But most of all... you. [PAGES FLIPPING] [TROLLEY BELL DINGS] YURY'S SON, VOICE-OVER: That day... my mother was arrested by the police. [FLICKING A LIGHTER] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Let's have a race. You go first. Take this. I'll give you a head start. I'll catch up. Don't look back. Now, run. Run! YURY'S SON, VOICE-OVER: I never saw her again. I can only suppose she died... or vanished somewhere. Forgotten as a nameless number... on a list which was later mislaid... in one of the innumerable concentration camps... in the north. Captioning made possible by Acorn Media.
