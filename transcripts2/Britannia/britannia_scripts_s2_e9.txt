 The sign of the snake has not been seen for 10,000 years. Well, I'm back. Many have sworn allegiance to the dark itself. -This is who we all are. -We follow a demon. The child of the gods will lead us into the light! She's going to drive the Romans back into the sea. We are facing a force that is getting stronger with every day. -Where am I? -Right in the middle of my prophecy! This is the final task. -Hold on. It's a red hot crucible. -It's the Trial of Fire. Not the trial of have-a-liedown-and-relax.

 Thank you for saving me. -Stop showing off. -I'm not. -You are. I can tell. -I'm not. -There's someone I want you to find. -You have no power over me. It was a massacre. It was the start of an alliance. Without your darkest foes. You want the Druid. I want the maiden. Leave the girl to me. I'm going to have to fight someone. Someone we can only fight with a ruddy magic bow. -Who sent you here? -The Dead Man. We'll destroy the Chosen One. Oh. That's not so good. We need to go. He tried to kill me. There's a demon in him. Come on!

 -Wait! -We don't need this. We don't need this. Girl. Girl. Girl! Footprints. Footprints. No footprints. No. She left it. She left it. It's the prophecy. I've failed. I've failed. Oh, shit. When I look out my window Many sights to see And when I look in my window So many different people to be Oh, no Must be the season of the witch Must be the season of the witch Yeah Must be the season of the witch You've got to pick up every stitch The rabbits running in the ditch Beatniks are out to make it rich Any joy? Whatever I was, I don't think it was a hunter. Did you get me one? What happened last night, with your friend? -He was never my friend. -Then why were you with him? That's a long story. You look different. -How? -I don't know, your eyes... Like a weight's been lifted off you. Whatever it was, you didn't need it. -I'm hungry. -Yeah, me, too. -Where's the apple tree? -Oh, fuck apples. Let's find meat. Apple trees grow meat. Why do you always talk in riddles? Hey. Wait for me. Shh. Wait. Watch this. Wow. You are... ..full of surprises. Not now. Trust me, Morrigan. This is not the time... Unless you know how to get my arse off this, or know how to get to the Lake of Tears, I suggest you don't get involved. Thank you. I know very well what Veran is going to do to me. Oh, you did, did you, all along? Well, aren't you the smart one? Doesn't make sense. Doesn't make sense. Veran blessed me. I walk these forests in his protection. So something... ...something is as powerful, or more powerful than Veran. But what? Hey. Look at me. Look at me. The Dead Man. The Dead Man sent him. Where will you go now? I don't know. You could go home. I don't have a home. -Not any more. -Hey. I don't have a home, either. So we both have nowhere to go. It looks that way. Maybe we could go nowhere together. What if I want to go nowhere on my own? You're going to get hungry. You are good at catching squirrels. And you're good for nothing. Good for nothing's good when you're going nowhere. -Let's give it a day. See how it goes. -All right, sounds fair. Off. Get it off. Get it off. Get it off! I can't reach. Please, help me here. Fuckin' help. She's going to tell him. She's going to tell him everything. So, which way is nowhere? North. West. South. s-How about east? -Sounds about right. When you come into someone else's life, do you interrupt theirs, or do they interrupt yours? I mean, whose path is it? I think, a bit of both. Doesn't feel like that, does it? Anyway, as I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted. I'm so sorry. Please continue. There's this prophecy... Yes. Yes. Yes! Give it to me. Harder! Harder! Take it off! Yeah! No, no, no, no, no, no, don't stop! Don't stop! No! No! No! Fuck it! Fuck it! Oh, wonderful. Just beautiful. Thank you, gods. The funny thing about being the Chosen One is that I have no choice in it. -Like your life wasn't your own. -Exactly. Yeah, I know that feeling. -So, what else can you do? -What? Tricks. You said he taught you stuff. -They're not tricks. -No? What are they? -I don't want to. -Hey, listen, it's fine. If you can't really do them and it's bullshit... Don't. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. You haven't upset me. Are you sure? I'm a dick. Where are you? All right. All right, that was good. I'm scared. -Where are you? -Can you hear me? Yes. Why were you in the river? I don't know. I don't believe you. Really? Maybe I was looking for something. Did you find it? Did you? The maiden is under the Dead Man's spell, which, as you rightfully point out, is a fucking disaster. And if that little twerp was powerful enough to trick me... ..it's possible he's taking her to the Lake of Tears, not to be reborn, but to be fore born. What do you mean, what's the difference? Why is everyone... There's an obvious, huge difference. To be reborn is to be reborn. To be fore born is to be sacrificed. What if this was always supposed to happen? What if I was destined to fail? Would the gods do that to me? You're right. Of course, they fucking would. Yep. -Who are you? -Who are you? No-one. What do you want? -Nothing. -Good. -Is something wrong? -Nothing wrong. Everything's fine. -Do you have any food? -No. What about the rabbit? -The rabbit's a friend. -Suit yourself. -Can I sit a while? -No. I... He's... This is... I'm his stump. No. -What's that? -Nothing. -Looks like a golden bow. -It's nothing of the sort. Quite possibly, if I've learned anything on this journey, -it's that nothing is how it seems. -I'll try to remember that. Ah. I've been on a journey. It's been quite a trip. -Whenever I think of getting anywhere... -You enjoying this? -Do you have kids? -I've never even had sex. I have two sons. One called Phelan, after me. Another called Rolf, after me. I'm going to speak plainly here so listen very carefully. I don't care you who are, where you're going, how many children you have. Right now, I have bigger fish to fry. So, happy travels. -Atonement. -Come again? Atonement. That's where I'm headed. Oh. -Why didn't you say? It's that way. -Yeah. -Oh. Thank you, friend. -Don't mention it. Hope is the daughter of a blind father. Fuck. Come back. Come back! Come back! No! Shit. Fucking shit! How about this? I guess it's good as anywhere. -Or nowhere. -I like it. It's a castle. It's got walls. -It's got turrets. -Passageways. -A very big boat. -Fire. -Fit for a king. -It's fit for a queen. The King and Queen of Nowhere. -Good evening, Your Majesty. -Highness. -Oh, I'm so sorry. I... -Good evening... ..Your Highness. -I'm hungry. -Yeah, me, too. -Fetch wood. -I've got a better idea. You fetch wood. -No, no, your Majesty. -Highness. No, no, Your Highness. I've got this. -This should be good. -Just light a fire, darlin'. I've got it. Oh. I don't know where The Lake of Tears is, but I know someone who does. No, no, no, no, no. This is a terrible idea. Terrible idea. No. I have no choice. Forgive me, gods. How did you do that? I have no fuckin' idea... ...Your Highness. -You were a fisherman. -Yeah, maybe I was. -Can you show me? -I don't know. I can try. I think you do, what I do is, you watch the water and then you see if you can spot any shadows. See, there, this one coming. See, there, there. -Now. -Piss off. He has pissed off. Let's go again. -Put your hands in. -There. This is dangerous. Oh, look. Okay, let's do it again. What's wrong? Hey. You've gone pale. -I felt something. -What? I'm not sure. Horrible feeling. -It's gone. It's gone now. -Do you want to sit down? I'm fine. You know, it doesn't work like that. I remember something. A small cottage by the sea. -It's full of people that look like... -Like what? Me. It sounds like my home, but it was yours. You were a fisherman. You lived by the sea with your family. It's coming back. I just remembered something, too. A feeling. One I haven't felt for a very long time. -What's that? -Not afraid. Of all the things I expected to see. The Guardian summoning Pwykka. This is embarrassing enough, Quane. Don't rub it in. I never knew that's what I was. -What? -The Guardian. I never knew I had a title in all this. I didn't know I'm the Guardian. You were the Guardian. I worked my nuts off, Quane. Day and night for 25 moons. Ask anyone. Ask him. Morrigan. Morrigan. Morrigan, tell him. Tell... Fucking fuck. Listen to me, boy. The Dead Man and Lokka have joined forces. Together, they seek to destroy all those left loyal to Veran. If the Dead Man wins, our time is over. -Will Veran not fight? -Veran is already greatly weakened. Now that you have failed him, who knows? -I must leave you now. -You can't leave me here. Once, you were a fine student, you could feel the wind, sing the songs of the stars. There was a fire in your eyes. I felt that, you, my boy, you might one day become the Veran. -Me? -Veran felt it also. He told me once. He said, "That boy will one day lead us." Veran said that? But then Pwykka came. Since then, you've been adrift. Veran loved you. That's why he gave you one last chance. And you failed. Wait. Quane. Wait. Quane! I know what happens next. The eagle does not devour the maiden. It carries the maiden in its claws to the Lake of Tears, where she will be... Where she will be what? Reborn. There's a problem. We don't know where the lake is. I'm not done, Quane! I'm not done! You don't give up, do you? But after what's next, you might wish you had. Where I am about to send you, you need to be stronger than you know. I've been to the Underworld. This isn't the Underworld. This journey is upward. Sun Mushrooms. Dog Moss. -Ooh. -A badger's heart. -What's that? -Powdered Time. Oh, I love thyme. I like to do bread with thyme. -Or beef. -No, my boy. Time. This is your last chance to prove you are the Guardian. No, I don't feel it. Sorry. Doesn't work for me. What the... Quane! Quane! Have you noticed how you mess most things up? -That's why I was there. -Where? In the river. When you found me. That's what I was there to do. -What? -Mess things up. What do you mean? I didn't fall in the river. I wasn't pushed. I jumped in. I did it myself. So that I could find you. Why did you want to find me? I told you. To mess things up. I came to spoil things. Lead you astray. -This isn't you. -Oh. It's me. -It's me, all right. -You're not doing this. -You didn't choose this. -But did you choose this? Or is it where I want you to be? Into the arms... ..of the eagle. Where are you? Let's play a game. I love games. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. -What happened? -It's all right. -What happened? -It's all right. What the fuck happened? Good morning. -Good morning. -How do you feel? It feels like a dream. That's what it was. A dream. I'm a fisherman's son. I have two brothers, and we live in the east, by the sea. We go out in the mornings on a small boat, before the sun rises, and we catch silverheads. A man came with long... He took us to another man... ..with dark eyes. My brothers. I don't know where they went. I just remembered something else. What? My name. My name is Mallin. -My name is Cait. -Hello, Cait. Hello, Mallin. -I'm a fisherman. -I told you. It's so strange. I'd forgotten what it felt like to... What felt like? What it felt like to just be... ...me. I'm me. Hey. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just happy for you. I'm me. I'm me. I can do what I want. Thank you. I can throw this rock in that lake. I feel so free. I'm free. Is that all right? Yes. I don't know what you did. I have no idea what you did, but thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's going to take forever. You've got a lot of layers. The Guardian. The Guardian. Hi. I'm the Guardian with the Golden Bow. I'm free. Islene, can you hear me? You were right. It's amazing. Islene, what should I do? Hello. It's you. How did you find me? Where are my brothers? I'm so sorry. -Mallin? -Help me. Mallin! Mallin! No! I have atoned.
