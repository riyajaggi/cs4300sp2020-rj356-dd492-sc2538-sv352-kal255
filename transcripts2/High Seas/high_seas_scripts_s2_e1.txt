 [Ost] We trusted that after the storm, the calm would come. The rest of the trip to Rio de Janeiro had to become a party to compensate for our bad experiences. Since those five castaways came onboard, a series of inexplicable events started to happen on the ship. [electricity buzzing] No one could imagine that the rescue of that adrift raft would trigger something yet more disturbing and dangerous. A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [Simon] And the ship? It should be here by now. Relax.

 - We're in the middle of nowhere, freezing. - [Gloria] Son, be quiet, please. It will come. Soon. [machine buzzing] - Is it ready? - Yes, Captain. Right now, both passengers and crew are in their cabins awaiting instructions. I want the whole crew searching. We have to find that animal. I'm sorry, Miss. Don't worry about me, Captain. Being my father doesn't change what he did. They're turning the ship upside down. From the engine room to the last cabin. What do the passengers say? There haven't been any incidents.

 They've understood it's for their own safety. Please! Are you sure we need so many precautions? He brutally attacked two men. I don't want to take any risks with the passengers. - Have you talked to Sofia? - We're going to now. I'll go with you. Captain, I don't think it's a good idea to go for a rescue now. - [Natalia] Of course it's not. - We cannot deny help to those people. Of course not. But we won't be able to put them in a safe place. How far have we changed course for the rescue? How's that important? It is very important. We can't waste any more time. Captain, every minute of delay is money the shipping line loses. Can't you see that? Of course I can. But we have our own law at sea, Miss. If you're suggesting that we deny their rescue, I'll ask you to leave my control bridge. CASANDRA Now. Natalia! Who does that captain think he is? Fernando, we have to be in Rio in ten days to pick up 20 tons of coffee. If we're not there, another ship will. I don't need to tell you how much money we'll lose. And all for saving those people. Lives are at stake. Conversation's over. I'm asking you to consider me for any decision from now on. - [Fernando] I have no reason to. - Excuse me, Fernando. Anibal's shares are mine. I'm your partner now. Not yet. What do you mean? When the inheritance is formalized, you'll be my partner. But until then, this ship is mine. Remember it. And above all, don't threaten me. Go to your cabin. Walking the corridors is dangerous. [door rattles] [clanging nearby] [Rojas] He's been unconscious for too long. What could happen to him? Doctor, tell me the truth. It's soon and I don't want to hurry, but... He could have internal injuries. [gasps] How could he do this to him? When evil gets inside a man, he's capable of anything. Francisca is right. I don't want to defend your father, but he's not well. His mind is disturbed, he's lost touch with reality. Too many people have lost their minds on this ship at some point. I'd never have helped him if I knew what he really was. And what he's done. And you didn't know? Of course not. He's deceived me like everyone else. Called me from the hospital, told me he was injured. That he needed help. How was I to know he was lying? Now we have to find him. You knew he was on this ship from the beginning. Think. Where was he hiding? Where did you used to see him? We met downstairs, in the engine room. I suppose you've looked there. [Nicolas] Yes, we have. [Sofia] I heard he attacked your brother, how is he? He's in sick bay. I'm sorry. Don't leave your cabin. Please watch her, don't let her leave. - [Eva] Think she's lying? - I don't know. We better watch her. I don't understand, I don't know what he wants. We're on a ship. He can't escape. I don't think he has a plan. He acts on instinct, making him more dangerous. I never thought I'd say this. But I was happier when I thought my father was dead. Come here. [horn blowing] Castaways. They've found them. Let's go. - [Fernando] Captain. - They're lifting a boat on board. - Just one boat? - I'm afraid so. Call the head cook to have hot food and beverages ready. Have sick bay ready, too. Mr. Pedro is there in a delicate condition. We shouldn't move him. Fine. Tell Dr. Rojas to see the survivors in the hall. Let's go. Cover yourselves with the blankets. You have to get warm quick. Thank you very much. It's too cold. We thought no one would find us. - [Eva] Use this one. - Thanks. It's been terrible. I can imagine. Why are you sad? I'm sorry? Due to your father? How do you know about that? Please, let's get inside. Pick up the luggage. Hurry. It's okay. I'll do it. Welcome. Fernando Fabregas, the ship owner. Anything you need, don't hesitate to ask. Thank you. This is the Barbara de Braganza . I'm her captain. I gave the order for you to be taken care of, don't worry. I thank you on behalf of all of us, Captain. Casandra Lenormand. Welcome. [Santiago] You'd better go down to the hall. Keep looking, there may be more survivors. No. There aren't. Let's not lose hope. This way, please. I'll go to the galley to make sure they're preparing something hot. Okay, go. [Gloria] If anyone said one hour ago, I'd be on a ship like this one, I wouldn't have believed it. [Teresa] The worst time was when we saw the lights of the ship in the distance. We didn't breathe until we heard the siren. Only you are left, I want to make sure. - It's not necessary, I'm fine. - Please. The others are fine. Slight hypothermia, nothing to worry about. Very well, thank you, Doctor. There was an explosion? What exactly happened? It was during dinner. Everything was normal until there was an explosion in the engine room that rocked the boat. - Her name was the Victoria. - [Santiago] What was your course? [Casandra] We left Conakry in Guinea and our final destination was Cape Town. What happened? When we were on the boat, there was a second explosion. Everything blew up. We tried to get closer to rescue anyone but... Must have been awful. It was. Food is ready in the canteen. You'll be shown where. Captain, we don't want to be any trouble. You're no trouble. Please go to the canteen. - We'll take better care of you there. - As you wish. I'll go with them. I want to make sure everyone's temperature is stable. [Fernando] Have the electrical panel checked. We're sorry, there must be a faulty fuse. No. It's not that. What do you mean? There's nothing wrong with the lights. How silent. Is there no one else on the ship? We're in an emergency situation. A man has attacked two people and we're looking for him. He's dangerous. Please go to the canteen and obey the seamen. Captain. - Captain, please. - Yes. Please go to the canteen. We'll find your father. It's a matter of time. We'll search the ship as long as needed. Trust me. I do. I'll go to sick bay. - Don't want to leave them alone. - I'll go with you. [Varela] Good evening. Excuse us, we're searching cabin by cabin. [man] He's not here. How long are we going to be locked in? I hope as briefly as possible. We'll go back to normal as soon as we find him. It's a cautionary measure, for your own safety. Thank you for your help. Good evening, sorry to bother you. We're searching cabin by cabin. [man] We're hungry! This is outrageous! [knock on door] Pierre! It won't be long. Stay, please, stay with me. That man gives me the creeps. His gaze pierces me. Calm down. Things are fixed for now. I'd be calmer if you stayed with me. I can't stay with you, my love. But I'll be back as soon as I can. Lock your door and try to rest. I don't want to be alone. I have to go. Done. Give it to me, please. Why are you taking our temperature all the time? It's essential to know whether you're recovering your body temperature. It's not up to 35 yet. And your pulse is weak. But I feel perfect. Of course, hypothermia can cause confusion and not knowing what's happening. That man they're looking for... He is dangerous, isn't he? [Rojas] He is. Too many innocents have died because of him. How do you know that? I don't know. Sometimes I feel a pain in my chest. Ever since I was a child. I see... visions. Well, not visions, I know things that other people don't. [Rojas] A gift. A nightmare. It depends. I'm a doctor, Miss, a scientist. I don't believe in things I can't prove. Centuries ago scientists thought the sun revolved around the earth, Doctor. - How is he? - Eva! His pulse is still weak. His fever is down, but he's still not responding to any stimuli. Any news about our father? No, the ship is very big. But we'll find him. This is a nightmare. - Our father... - Since he did all this and escaped he's not our father, Carol. Dad is dead. It's better to remember him as we knew him. - I'll go see what the situation is. - Officer. - Have you seen my daughter? - No, I'm not searching the cabins. But I can ask. Let me see if she's in our cabin. I haven't seen her all day, I'm worried. I can go with her. No, Eva. Where are you going? He won't hurt me. We don't know that. I do know. Let's do this: I'll go with you. She's not here. - Francisca! - Where is she going? - [Dimas] Who is it? - It's me, Francisca, open up. - Have you seen Veronica? - No. - I guess she is with Sebastian. - You guess but don't know. I'm not sure. What's wrong? Which is Sebastian's cabin? It's 269, sir. We've checked. Mr. Sebastian is resting. Let me check it myself. [door opens] Who's there? [Lucía] It's me. Lucia. Lucia, you scared me. What are you doing? We can't leave our cabins. I know. The thing is... - I was going to... - Where? To look for Veronica. They can't find her, her mother's worried. I'm sure she's with one of the ladies, or your master. Relax. She'll be fine. How are you? Scared to death. Do you want to come in? Veronica! - Sebastian, is my daughter here? - Shh. - Passengers are sleeping. - Sebastian! - Madam, this is not a good time. - Is my daughter here? She's not... presentable, right now. This is embarrassing. - [Veronica] Mom, please, I'm a grown up. - But are you okay? - Of course I am. - [Francisca] Let me see you then! I have no clothes on. You can rest assured. Yes. And you, tell your butler to use the iron properly. Dima is not my butler anymore. I've fired him. Tell him to come pick his stuff up. Come on, Francisca, we can't stay here. Veronica, stay there till everything is solved. Yes, Mother, don't worry about me. And you... If you hurt my daughter, you will have to face me. I'd never hurt your daughter, I can assure you. Are you relieved? Yes, Miss. Okay, okay. You can let Veronica go. - Sit. - Please. Sit down! Fire again. I didn't realize the stove was on and everything got burned. [knock on door] Don't open it. [knock on door] Stay here. - Who is it? - It's me, Francisca. - Tell me. - Hello. Hello. I came to tell you Veronica is fine. - Don't worry. - Thank you very much. You were right. She was with your master. - He's not your master anymore? - What do you mean, he's not? He said he had fired you. What? Why? I don't know. Said he fired you and you had to pick your stuff up. Madam, let's go. Go to your cabin. I hope this is over soon. What a sorrow. - You've been fired? - I can't believe it. I was with him this afternoon and he said nothing. What did you expect? Masters are like this. They do what they want with no explanations. The rescue team has found no more survivors. We resume our journey. Half speed ahead. We're moving. All your temperatures are stable. You're out of danger. Are you okay? Miss? Don't worry, relax. It's nothing serious. I have to talk to the captain. I can't let anyone leave the canteen. - I know, but it's very important. - What's wrong? I know where that man is. He's about to reach his limit, we don't have time. What is it? [Carlos] We're moving. The ship is setting out. Easy. Sit down, I said! [Carlos] What did you want to do? - I'm not afraid of you. - Veronica! You're not? You should be. Sit down and don't do anything foolish again. Could you please sit and calm down? You're making me nervous. Yes, but it doesn't make any sense, Lucia. I have to pick my stuff up? It's weird, all of this is. Well, as soon as we can leave, you go and ask him. But you can't do anything now, so calm down. Yes, you're right. I have to calm down. Hey! Can we leave now? [man] No, please stay in your cabin. Yes. - Don't leave, please! - Just a minute. Hey! Come back here! I clearly ordered that no one could leave the canteen. Captain, please, don't blame this man. I insisted, I had to talk to you. Casandra? What's going on? I know where your father is. He's in a first-class cabin. You have to believe me. How do you know that? It's hard to explain and we don't have time. Your father is not alone. The people with him are in grave danger. We searched every first-class cabin. Go back to the canteen and let us do our job. Search them again, please. Captain, this will be on your conscience. Take the lady downstairs. We can't waste time on speculations. Wait a minute. Search the first-class cabins again. [Nicolas] Captain, it's just intuition. Sometimes we have to follow intuitions, Officer. - [Santiago] Yes? - Captain, he wants to talk to you. - What is it? - Her father is in Sebastian's cabin. [Nicolas] It's impossible. We've just been there. - Is it a first-class cabin? - [Nicolas] Yes, Miss. Call Mr. Fernando and Varela. To my office. You go back to the canteen, Miss. It's for your safety. And relax, we'll do everything we can. Thank you, Captain. See how I was right? Trust me. Kid, stay. You could be helpful. To my office. [Pedro coughing] Uncle Pedro. Uncle. It's Carolina. Carolina? - Carolina. - Finally. What happened? What happened? You suffered a strong hit to your head. Why? Why are the lights off? No. The lights are not off. The lights are not off? Uncle, can't you see me? No, Carolina, I can't. - I can't see. - [woman] Calm down. Go get the doctor. - I can't see, Carolina. - Yes. I can't see. Uncle. Relax, okay? It's nothing. - I'll be right back. - Carolina. Carolina. [Santiago] The cabin is here. Kid, do you know if Sebastian has a gun? No sir, no guns. A team could enter through the door. I can go with a team through the balcony. We have to be careful. The ship is in silence. If he hears people in the halls, he could notice. - Why don't you let me go and talk to him? - It's dangerous. He won't hurt me, I'll get him to surrender. Don't insist, Eva, we won't risk it. Miss, Mr. Fernando is right. Your father is beyond convincing. - We'll knock the door down. - No. Don't you see that if that man has a gun, he could shoot Veronica? - Silence, please, kid. - [Dimas] Captain, it's crazy. - He's right. - [Dimas] Of course. Silence, please, or I'll have you kicked out. I'll go first. - [whispers] I have the key to the cabin. - [Nicolas] He will enter... - [Santiago] Let's go. - [Varela] If I may give you some advice, shoot to kill. - What are we waiting for? - Eva, go with your sister. Wait, wait, what are we going to do? Enter the cabin. - Just like that? - Yes, like that. It could be very dangerous. Let's think about it. I don't need to think, we don't have much time, so give me the key. But, Miss, this is... I understand you're afraid. But he won't hurt me. - We don't... - Give me the key. - Let her go. - No! - No! - Let her go. Why are you here? Dad. Let Veronica go. - Let her go, now. - [Sebastian] Go away, Eva. No. I won't leave. This madness is over. Your only way out is surrendering. She grew up in your home, don't you have a soul? - [Carlos] Leave! - No. - Leave! - No. What will you do? Kill her? You'll have to kill me too. - [Eva] Dad! - Are you okay? - Veronica! - [Dimas] Relax, Veronica. It's over now. Relax. [Eva] Dad! Stop! You have to help me. Why would we have to help you? I'm your father. No. You stopped being our father a long time ago. Come with us. You can't do this to me. Give me the knife. - Give me the knife and stop running. - Eva. Carolina. You have to help me. Eva! Wait. Nobody move. Eva, don't take another step. Don't take another step. Give me the knife. It's over. [Nicolas] Take him away. It's over. It's over, Eva. Mother. [Francisca] It's over. It's over, it's over. I'm sorry I lied to you, but I was very scared. I should have realized. Will you put me in here, like an animal, Captain? It's the right place for you. Put him inside. Wait a minute. Are you afraid to let me write, Officer? No, but you could pick the lock with this. Let me warn you. Try to escape, and I'll throw you overboard myself. You betrayed my friendship and trust. I hope you pay for all you've done. Captain, this can't be the end. Will you be able to sleep knowing I'm here? [Rojas] Can you see anything? I can't see anything. - [Rojas] Your eyes are okay. - [Carolina] Why can't he see, then? [Rojas] Because of the hit. A bruise must be pressing on his optical nerve. Rojas. Is it incurable? Tell me the truth. [Rojas] I really don't know, Pedro. If we were on land, I could run some tests. But let's not lose hope. [Eva] Of course not. You'll be fine, Uncle. I made a few mistakes in my life, maybe this is the way to pay for them. Don't say that, Uncle. We'll get a real doctor. And he'll heal you, you'll see. We'll do anything. The best thing you could do is rest. I'll stay with your uncle, don't worry. - Shall we? - Yes. See you later. I don't know how I thought you'd stay put till we did something. Staying put was never my thing. Fortunately. You know why I entered that cabin? Because I didn't want anything to happen to him. Even after all he's done. It's normal. He's your father. Yes, he's my father. Do you think Casandra knew where he was hiding? I don't know. But if she didn't, she guessed right. Dr. Rojas says she has a certain gift to predict things. And you believe that? I only believe what I see. I'll go see my sister. What a wedding night she had. I'm on duty. - Try to rest. - All right. [man] Officer. - Telegram for you. - Thanks. [Nicolas] "Dear Nicolas. I'm Chantal. Waiting for you in Rio. Darling, I have a lot to tell you." It was going to be the happiest day of my life. Honey, we'll have many happy days. [Eva] Fernando is right. Today was a horrible day. But you have your whole life ahead, you'll see. There is that woman. I wanted to meet you. Fernando has told me. Your face looks familiar. Have we met before? I don't know. Maybe from a past life. Carol, this is Casandra. Casandra, my sister. Nice to meet you. Okay, it looks like we're all feeling calmer. [Eva] Yes, we are. I guess it must be hard to sleep. We could bring some tea to your cabin. Thanks a lot. How did you know where my father was hiding? Well, it's not easy to explain. You may call it intuition. A sense to detect certain energies that other people can't see. Do you believe in that power? - What's happening to the lights? - [Fernando] I don't know. They checked them and say they're fine. Casandra. Casandra, are you okay? Several people have died on this ship. [Fernando] Yes. Three men have died, since we set sail. Yes, three men. And a woman too. [Carolina] What? But it was before leaving. What? A woman? [Casandra] Yes, a woman. She's still here. And her killer too.
