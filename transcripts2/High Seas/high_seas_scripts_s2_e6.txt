 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [music-theme playing] HIGH SEAS Captain, I swear, everything was done for a good cause. It's the reason I came to work here as a receptionist. We needed someone inside the ship from the start. Life is full of good causes upheld by evil deeds. You would have done better to be honest from the beginning. I know. I know, but we had to act in secret. Who did Rosa agree to meet that night?

 Fernando, of course. Who else? She was afraid so asked me to accompany her. We were close friends. Then what happened? I must have waited in the hall for over half an hour. Go on. I heard a sound. [Nicolás] What kind of sound? A thud. A heavy thud. [thud] [Agustín] I ran towards it... then heard the shot. [gunshot]

 Rosa! [gunshot] Rosa! I was afraid. I couldn't see anything and I didn't know if anyone else was there. I don't like fighting or carrying weapons. I was defenseless. [Eva] How long did you wait outside? Around two hours, perhaps a little longer. And you saw no one come out? No, Miss. No one. [Santiago] The ship has other exits. I kept close watch. I assure you that while I was there, no one came out. [Santiago] Why didn't you go to the police? I went home hoping she would show up there in a while. - [Eva] But she never came. - No. Why didn't you go to the police then? It's just very hard to understand, Agustín. [Agustín] I didn't want to compromise her. It was a very delicate situation. What do you mean? Rosa and Fernando were in a relationship that had to be kept secret. For obvious reasons. Don't you think that hearing a gunshot is reason enough to reveal the relationship? Hm? This is about saving a life. Unless there was a more pressing reason for keeping it quiet. I've told you everything I know. I must talk to my sister. [Santiago] Nicolás... Call Mr. Fábregas, please. I wish to speak with him now. Yes, Captain. What's the matter? I'm not sure how to tell you. Spit it out then. Eva! The night Rosa Marín disappeared, she was with Fernando. Here. What do you mean, here? He arranged to meet her on the ship. She came to see him and... And she was never seen again. But don't you see this is madness? CHAPTER 14: THE OTHER SIDE [Casandra] Agustín says that my sister agreed to meet you. But that's not true. Did you see us? Did you? [Agustín] I didn't. But who else would she meet? That's what you should find out. All I know is that you've told too many lies recently. There is a lot to explain. You're in no position to reproach anyone for anything. Had I spoken the truth, no one would've believed me. We know for certain that Rosa Marín boarded the ship and never left. You were seeing Rosa, don't deny it! [door opens] [Fernando] What are you doing here? Wait outside, please. Don't worry, Fernando. I know everything. - Carol, no, let me explain. - Fernando. - Please. - You knew Rosa Marín. You had an affair with her. You can't deny that. But I didn't kill her, I swear. I know. Captain... there's something you should know. Well, something you should all know. Especially you, Casandra. It's from your sister. My sister? But Carolina... What does it say? It's a letter from Rosa to Fernando in which she breaks up with him, and says that she's going to New York. Did you know about this? [Fernando] No. I know as much as you do. Where did you get it? Hm? You had it and kept it hidden? [Carolina] The girl was leaving and I decided to put it all aside. But when that ghost appeared, and then Rosa Marín's name came up on the Ouija, I got scared. I suppose there's no need to keep questioning Mr. Fábregas. [Santiago] It's best we close this matter for now. Although you still have a lot to explain. Naturally, Captain. I sincerely regret all the trouble I've caused and... I'll take full responsibility. Excuse me. Please, Casandra. I understand you're angry... I'm angry, sad, disappointed... So at least now you know how I feel. I don't think you have any reason for reproach. Do you know how long I have believed my sister to be dead? And that Fernando killed her? But, how could your sister leave without saying anything? I don't know. We weren't as close as you are. To the extent that she'd leave without even telling you she was alive? I suppose I didn't realize how far apart we had grown. I've spent two years preparing a pointless plan. Why didn't you show me the letter sooner? Why? Because you made me suspect Fernando. You made me believe that he might have killed Rosa. I couldn't show the letter until I knew the whole truth. I trusted you. By lying to me. That's how you gained everyone's trust. In all of this, only one thing was real to me. What I felt for you. [door opens] What's the matter? What is it? Read it. Who had this? - Carolina. - Carolina? - Why didn't she say anything? - I don't know. But this is wonderful news, isn't it? I can send a telegram to the authorities so they can try to trace her in New York. - No. - What do you mean? Why not? If this is true, my sister knew very well the pain I was going through. How much do you have to hate someone to do such a thing? Perhaps it wasn't hate. - She also had reason enough to feel hurt. - No. No, nothing happened that couldn't be resolved. Every family has its problems. It's just so strange because she was never one to run away from problems. Never. All the more reason to send a telegram and find her. Try to resolve things once and for all. No. If she left, she doesn't want to be found. This just can't be. What's the matter? Bring me the files. The one with the deeds, please. My sister didn't write this letter. Look. Do you see? I can't believe it. I must tell Carolina. Wait a moment. Are you completely sure? - Of what? - Carolina had that letter. If Carolina knew that Fernando and Rosa were having an affair, she had reason to kill her. No. Carolina wouldn't do that. Are you certain? You didn't believe she could lie either. Fernando has always claimed his innocence. Perhaps he was speaking the truth. [Fernando] How long were you hiding that you knew? Is that all that matters to you? If Rosa Marín is 5,000 kilometers away, it's because I never had any doubt, Carolina. I chose you. In Rosa's letter, she is the one who leaves you. If that hadn't been the case, perhaps she would be here now. Why didn't you cancel the wedding then? I forgave you. Because I love you. Because we had planned our lives together. And yet you didn't support me. I was always at your side. They did everything to accuse me. It's been proven that Casandra made it all up. But while everyone was suspecting me, you were blameless. Why would anyone suspect me? I don't know Rosa Marín. Someone must've asked her to meet that night. What do you mean by that? Whoever it was wanted to speak to her. Or perhaps ask her to disappear. - Fernando, are you accusing me? - No, I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm just saying that some people might think you made her come. I didn't expect this from you. [knock on door] - Who is it? - [Pierre] Me. Open the door, please. What do you want? I suppose you are angry with me. No, Pierre. I wish I were angry with you. Anger fades. How can I make everything better? I don't know. You lied to me. Have you always been honest with me? Excuse me? What do you mean? Aníbal. Did you know him before he boarded the ship? Why would you ask such a thing? It's a perfectly ordinary question, Clara. Did you know him? If you have nothing to hide, why does it matter? I won't talk to you any longer. Get out of here now! Answer me. Did you know him? What happened the night Aníbal died? Clara, I want the truth. What do you mean, the truth? I already told you the truth! When you went to his cabin, was that the first time? Or had you been seeing him? Leave! Get out of my sight! You broke my heart and now you think I'm lying. - Clara, I'm sorry. - I said, get out! You were the only thing that gave me hope. The only thing! Now you're nothing to me. And now I have nothing. Go! [Francisca] Good morning. - Good morning, Francisca. - I arrived this morning and saw that you'd already made the bed. Oh, yes. I woke early, so saved you some work. But if you save me some work, then there's no point in me being here. What nonsense! We couldn't manage without you. Right. Unless you did it to hide the fact that you weren't alone last night. If you didn't spend the night alone, - I can imagine who you were with. - Francisca. And that man, Miss, has a wife waiting for him in Brazil. I know. Believe me, I know. But I love him, I can't help it. Miss, I'm not your mother, but since she's been gone, I tried to look after you as if you were my own. And you do. You mean so much to us. What I mean to say is that sometimes you have to think things through. Getting carried away is okay. But you may end up getting hurt. But what if it hurts more to do nothing? Just take care. I don't want you to suffer. I know, Francisca. Well, I shall go out for some air. - Try to clear my mind. - Of course. Go. Are you all right? I need to get some air. I don't know what to say. It's all becoming a little too much for me. - Why did you hide this from me? - Eva, please. I don't want to argue with you. It's simply that I was embarrassed that you should know. I'm sorry. No. I'm sorry. It must have been very difficult. I believed that girl wasn't important to Fernando, do you see? I thought we could leave it behind us. It's normal... to fight for the things you love. Do you forgive me? Don't be silly, of course. Excuse me, but you must see this. - [Eva] What's the matter? - Look. The signature. My sister always signed as María Rosa, because of our grandmother. Here she signed Rosa Marín. Well. Couldn't she just have signed as Rosa Marín for once? No, my sister always signed that way. Since she was little. Someone forged her handwriting but got the signature wrong. So... So Agustín was right. Much as it pains me, my sister didn't leave this ship alive. If what you're saying is true, then whoever wrote this letter, killed Rosa. Anything to say? Carolina? Me? What could I say? Well, you found the letter. So? So now you suspect me? I didn't say that. You didn't say it, but your eyes did. Do you really believe that if it had been me, I would have been so perverse as to write a letter that reveals my fiancée’s infidelity? - I've seen worse things. - As have I! Such as causing panic on a ship with talk of fake ghosts, for example! Had I written this letter, why would I have hidden it for two years? That's enough! Carolina, you don't need to explain yourself. And Fernando would never have done this. Hide a murder by revealing his infidelity. So, who was it? Who? To be certain there was a murder, we would first need to find the body. - Hello. - What are you doing here? I received an invitation to lunch. You? I received one too. And I can imagine who is behind this... Sebastián. De la Cuesta. No, please, don't leave. Give me half a minute. No, not half a minute, not even half a second. I don't want to see you again. That's going to be very difficult. We're on a ship. Please, I have something important to tell you. Especially to Dimas. [Dimas] Look, sir... Yes. I no longer work for you, so get to the point or I will leave. I intend to recover what is yours. And after that, I promise you shan't see me anymore. How do you plan to do that? By playing poker. What? Yes. Arturo plays every day. I plan to play against him. Take him to the edge. What do you mean, playing poker? You both own the business. No, that's what I was trying to tell you. Arturo tricked me too. The contract is in his name. And you think he'll risk the business playing poker against you? Without a doubt. Greed is like a fire. The more wood you add, the harder it burns. He's a vile and vicious rat, I'm certain that I can crush him... It's the most ridiculous plan I've heard. No, please, you must trust me. I'm being serious. But now I could really use your help. Miss, what are you doing here? Do you need anything? No, no, I don't need anything, Francisca, sit. I wanted to talk to you. What about? About the letter. Letter? Which letter? You know very well the letter I mean. The one that was sent to Fernando. Huh? I thought that had been forgotten. So did I. Francisca, you found that letter. Yes, I told you a hundred times, they slipped it under the door. Yes, but you must have seen someone. - Someone in the street. - No, I saw no one. Do you know what's in the letter? No. But I know who it's from. You knew what was going on between Fernando and that woman. People talk. I'd heard something. But why didn't you tell me? Miss Carolina, I didn't want to get involved. I thought it would pass, and it did, didn't it? Yes. It did. I'm going. Miss. Let it be. The past is in the past. If the captain catches us, he'll give me hell. - What'd you rather do? Ask him for them? - I don't want him to find out anything. There are no plans. Just nautical charts and ship's logs. This boat is worse than a maze. We need those plans. This is madness. Where might they be? What did I tell you? - Look, they're sorted by date. - Let's see. We'll take the most recent and leave. What are you doing here? The captain asked me for the nautical charts. Very well. - I'll go now. - All right. - Fernando. - Yes? Casandra says the letter from her sister is fake. - That it wasn't written by her. - What? Yes. The signature doesn't match. So I'm under suspicion again. No. No, you didn't write that letter. You wouldn't have mentioned your infidelity. I know I was wrong. And that there's no excuse. No. - But you don't need to apologize to me. - I know. We all make mistakes, right, Eva? [Casandra] The ship has changed a lot. I barely recognize it. I know there were passages between the corridors and cabins, but they couldn't be seen by everyone. So why were they built? Because the ship was used for contraband. It was a good way to hide and move merchandise. It wouldn't make sense to leave passages when they remodeled the ship. Perhaps there is someone who could help us. No. - Eva, no. - Yes, Carolina. He's the only one. [Carlos] I don't know. I'm not sure. There's no other way for you to get out before we reach land. The lifeboat is ready. You'll go to the infirmary and take something to feel better. Then all we have to do is wait for nightfall. Leaving everything up to Rojas seems a little like suicide. The alternative is going to prison. Anyway, not everything is up to Rojas. If he fails to fulfill his part of the bargain, I'm capable of anything. [door opens] [Carlos] Have you come down here to visit the zoo? If you hadn't behaved like an animal, then you wouldn't be caged like one. Why are you here? You're obviously looking for something. - Were the passages blocked off? - What? You were here when the ship was remodeled, so you must know. Were they blocked off? This ship is full of secrets. Many. Something bad is happening, isn't it? Why is it so important? It's Fernando. Fernando? - I never liked him. What's happened? - [Carolina] I don't know. I just want to find out if I'm married to someone who is capable of killing a woman. You should know by now that some people will do anything to protect the people they most love. You never protected us from anything. You thought only of yourself. Don't make excuses. Come on, Eva. I said it was a bad idea. What you're looking for is watching you. What? What you're looking for has been watching you. - Look, we're not interested in riddles. - I am. I always enjoyed them. Or have you forgotten? Let's go. You don't know what you're talking about. - I told you we shouldn't have come. - [Carlos] I know what I'm talking about. [door opens, then shuts] Tell Rojas, all right. - Only one matter left to resolve. - The gold. I'll take care of that. Everything will work out, right? Have I ever failed? [knock on door] Yes? - May I? - [Eva] Of course. Did he tell you anything? No. Nothing useful. I think it's a mistake to search the ship for passages. What do you mean? Agustín didn't see anything. But he heard a shot. We should search that area. Eva. We can't look for a body in that area. There are people everywhere. We'll be careful, but we can't just do nothing. We should wait until this evening when everyone is dining in the hall. [audience applauding] Play "If I Told You."

You must do something. And what you must do is leave here, now. You're not helping. No. I'll stay with her. That's an order. Leave, Officer. It's for the best. I love you. How is she? She's very unwell. He doesn't know what's wrong. I will talk to Nicolás so he can take charge of my duties and I can remain with you as long as you need. That isn't necessary, sir. No, yes, it is necessary. I have a duty to everyone on this ship. Especially to my crew. - Try to stay calm. - Thank you, sir. Was she herself this morning? She was singing and she fainted. Did she say anything? Yes. That she never lied to me. I've heard that Rosa Marín sent a letter. And that she's in New York. You must be relieved. The matter is resolved. The letter was fake, she didn't write it. What? Do you suspect me again? No, but it's only logical that whoever killed that girl must also have written the letter. - To avert suspicion. - Varela. Don't worry. I know you didn't kill her. You know that I have a sixth sense for these things. And what does it tell you? Who killed her? My divinatory powers aren't that useful. But it's clear that when one person dies, another benefits. Rosa never harmed anyone. I'm sure that's true. But perhaps not everyone thought so. If you would excuse me. [door shuts] [door opens] I did everything in my power but... unfortunately, Clara knew what she was doing to herself. What do you mean? She ingested a large quantity of sleeping pills. I tried to pump her stomach, but it was too late. Believe me, I'm sorry. You can go in. Clara. Clara. Clara, my love. [Natalia] Pierre. This was you. Your lies. It worked with her, but it won't work with me. Pierre, please, calm down. Clara didn't kill herself. You killed her. Is something wrong? No. It's nothing. SLEEPING PILLS DON'T FORGET ME. CLARA R. It was my fault. It was my fault. Don't say that. Yes. I didn't stand by her. I will never forgive myself. Don't say that. You must rest. I'll take care of everything. [man over PA] We are sorry to tell you that our singer, the amazing Clara Romero, has passed away. Our band will play in her honor. [chattering] [band playing mellow jazz music] I think we should leave it for another day. Yes. Perhaps that is best. No. We'll arrive in Brazil soon. It must be today. All right. Let's go then. Gin. This is where I last saw her. She went up the corridor to Mr. Fernando's office. Let's go. I don't know what happened, but I suppose they must have argued, that Rosa got scared and ran away. The hurried footsteps that you heard. The shortest route would have taken her along here. - Is this where you were, Agustín? - Yes. I was a little further away. I heard the footsteps, but I didn't see her. [Eva] She must have been running from someone. Quickly. But she must have gone past you. So? You heard sounds? - Close by? - Yes. But as though they were coming from behind a wall. Because they were coming from behind a wall. But which wall? [Agustín] The gunshot echoed on all sides. - [Eva] There's nothing here. - [Carolina] This is madness. Perhaps they threw the body into the sea. No, let's not give up, please. Let's go through it again, from the start. [Carolina] Eva. It's watching us. [Carolina] What? Father said that what we were looking for has been watching us from the start. She's watching us. [Eva] It's on the other side. How do we get to the other side? There's a corridor that leads to the other side. [Carolina] Here's the mural. We're on the other side. [Eva] Help me, Agustín. We must tell someone. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid your husband will find it very difficult to avoid prison. Or worse. [suspense song]
