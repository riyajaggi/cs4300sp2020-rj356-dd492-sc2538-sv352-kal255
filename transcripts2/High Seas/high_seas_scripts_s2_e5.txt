 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Bridge. - Officer. - Yes? The men in the machine room report one of the furnaces is overheating. I'll speak to the captain about reducing speed. Report back to me if the temperature rises. Hey, you! Are you all right? I've just seen the ghost. - Where? - In a hallway on the crew deck. - That's the least of it. - What do you mean?

 The point is, ghosts don't go around leaving things behind. Hello. I wanted to speak to Casandra for a minute. Of course. I'll open up, don't worry. Thank you. Ms. Casandra? Oh, goodness! Casandra! Casandra, wake up! Casandra! Call the doctor, quickly! Casandra! Casandra! The blow wasn't caused by a fainting spell. We found her unconscious on the floor

 when Ms. Carolina and I entered the cabin. One possibility might be that her blood pressure dropped while seated, she fell and hit her head, but that's not what happened. In which case? Someone hit her with a blunt object. Weren't you able to see who it was? - No. - Please, I don't understand. Who would do such a thing, please? Hadn't you mentioned thieves? No, none of the drawers were open. I don't think anything is missing because... I wasn't hit by a thief. Perhaps it was that ghost. Perhaps it doesn't like you. I think it's apparent certain people don't like what's happening on this ship. THE FINAL ACT Maybe this is their reaction. They think it's my fault. I won't add credence to your accusation by defending myself. And I won't tolerate another attack. Why would you think I'm talking about you? Do you see what she's doing? See? - She didn't mention you. - She... I shouldn't be here. Fernando! In fact, it is best we leave her to rest, please. Try to stay awake for the next few hours, if you start to feel dizzy or unwell, let me know. I'm also going to give you an analgesic for the pain. Okay. It's in sick bay. If you would come to get it. Naturally. - Good night, Casandra. - Carolina. Could you stay with me? I think it would help me to have some company. Thank you. I won't allow that woman to accuse me again! I suppose your sister is with her? You won't say anything? Do you think all this is fine? Carolina knows that, on the day Rosa Marín disappeared, you were in Vigo, not Barcelona, as you claimed. You see... I can explain. I know you can. But if you want her to believe you, you'll have to tell her the truth. I didn't kill that woman. That's the truth. Someone believes you did, and is clearly trying to incriminate you. Who used to own the Bárbara de Braganza? - What? - Who did you buy this ship from? Why are you asking? It's a very simple question. The thing is that... - I don't know who the owner was. - I still think it strange - there's no form of paperwork... - What's your point? Casandra has a brooch with the old ship's insignia. I suppose you know nothing? Whatever it is that you're hiding, I doubt it's worse than murder. I told you. I want all the hallways under surveillance. All. Is that clear? Enough of this sense of uncertainty. But Captain, too much surveillance may be counterproductive for the passengers. Do as I order. - But, Captain! - No buts! Why can't you keep your mouth shut? Must you have an opinion on everything? Nicolás! Don't worry. He's overwhelmed, don't take it personally. I'm not. But we will all end up losing our minds. - You didn't tell him about the bow? - No. If Casandra was unconscious, she can't be the ghost. Officer. Detective Varela has arrested the man who was stealing from the cabins. Let's go. What have you had disappear? A pearl choker. Describe it. Well, I don't know, it's a pearl choker. Sorry, but unless you give me some more detail... It has a gold clasp, and my initial. That's better. - What's your name? - Beatriz. Beatriz. Yes. Thank you, sir. Good evening. - Please. - Thank you. - Sorry but, is there no one else left? - No. There are no more passengers. What can I do for you? The man you arrested is one of the survivors? No. He was traveling in third class. He boarded in Vigo, like everyone. Why? I suppose you have a reason for asking. There could be a connection between the thefts and the ghost. The fact that the boy has no connection to the ghost doesn't mean he knows nothing. What is this? It's a potentiometer. It's for adjusting the intensity of an electric current. That is, it makes lights flicker as if there was a spirit presence. No one has reclaimed it. Doing so would be to admit guilt. We need to talk to that boy - so he can tell us where he got this. - Very well. Let's go. - Here he is. - Julián? He may appear harmless, but they're the worst. - Are you sure you're not mistaken? - Look. This was the first thing that caught my attention. People who travel in third class tend to have hands that are rough from work. - This lout has the hands of a gentleman. - Thank you, Varela. Good work. Did you assault a woman in her cabin? - No. - Are you going to believe this scoundrel? Of course he hit her. Let's go. May we speak to him alone? I will take responsibility. He's all yours. I'll be in my cabin. - I'm sorry. - Where did you get this? - I found it. - Where? By the stairs. Do you have anything to do with the ghost in the hallways? No, of course not. All I've done is steal four pieces of jewelry. You can't accuse me of everything. We're not accusing you of anything. Look, lad. You have a lot to lose. Hm? If you tell us where you got this, we can help you. I don't think you can. Julián, please. That's all I know. I thought we were friends. But I see I was wrong. Eva. They're watching your sister. What do you mean? Nothing like this has happened to me before. It's horrid. I'm so terribly sorry. Knowing someone wants to hurt you like that is... is strange. And very frightening. Carolina. What happened earlier, I don't usually do that. No need to explain, Casandra. Yes. Yes, because I want you to know that... I did it because it came from my heart. That when I got on this ship I wasn't expecting to meet someone like you. Who'd show such concern for me. When I saw you on the floor like that... I don't know. I couldn't bear for anything bad to happen to you. I have your medicine. Thank you. I'd better... I should leave you to rest. Carolina. Thanks. This is getting risky. Perhaps we should stop. Erich, I've come this far, I won't stop now. On the contrary. We must proceed apace. It has to be tonight. Where would you hide a microphone? In the lamps. In the bookshelves. Let's go. You wanted to stop that woman in her tracks. Why are you so worried now? Not like this, Varela. Not like this. - Tell me you had nothing to do with this. - Your doubts are offensive, Mr. Fábregas. The person who hit this woman is an amateur. Don't worry. I was arresting the thief at that time. There are witnesses. Find out who did this. I'm on it. And now, with your permission, I will drink a coffee. It will be a long night. Nicolás. Look at this. What is it? Looks like a staircase. Let's see where it leads. Be careful. Try not to make any noise. Don't worry. What would anyone want with all this? They've been communicating with the survivors. You don't still believe they were shipwrecked? With their luggage? I never believed it. There's information about passengers here... about you. About your sister. The captain. Let me see. Eva Villanueva. Impulsive, stubborn, hasn't written in months. Rather accurate. This makes it easy to predict the future. Having marked cards. But if this isn't a survivor's cabin, then whose is it? I don't know, but look at this. That's my sister's cabin. That's how they've been watching her all this time. - Yes. - Julián must have come in and seen this. - But why didn't he say anything? - Well, because he was afraid. And now I am too. You have a lot of explaining to do. No one goes into a cabin and hits someone just like that. There must be a reason. Are you questioning me? I know as much as you do. Fernando. I own this ship too. And I like to know - what's happening on board. - Did Casandra tell you anything? Why would she? Because you're close and you were in her cabin. You must have spoken. Say something, talk to me. No. She didn't. Nothing? I don't believe you. I don't know why that woman wants to slander me. Please tell me you had nothing to do with this. - Excuse me? - How dare you... - Don't meddle in our business. - No. You're my brother... Natalia, please! Look me in the eyes. I swear I had nothing to do with this. You don't believe me, do you? - It's not that. - You don't. Why do you trust a woman you've only just met? Because she listens to me. And she understands me, which you never have. I've always been the one taking care of you. Don't you see all that woman wants is to split us up? Fernando, I don't know what she wants. But it's clear that she isn't to blame for all your problems. Where were you when she was attacked? You suspect me too? Fernando. I just want to help. I know. Sorry. I was here. - Alone? - Yes. Why? It doesn't help. From now on, if anyone asks, you were with me. I have no reason to lie. I know. But I don't want anyone to doubt you. Whose cabin is this, Simón? - I don't know. - Simón? I don't know. They don't tell me anything. I don't even know why they're doing this. They offered my mother and me money and we took it. That's all I know. Was there a shipwreck? Did the ship really sink? No. A ship left us in the lifeboat after sending a distress signal. We knew that the Bárbara de Braganza could come for us. This is obviously all a sham. But why are they doing this? I don't know. I swear I don't know. Come. We need to surprise them when the ghost next appears. But in front of everyone so there can be no doubt. How I can possibly refuse you? Simón, we want to help. But you must cooperate. I am cooperating. I'm telling you the truth. Who are you trying to protect? Casandra? Erich? Simón, you'll all end up in prison. - Prison? - Mmm. You are committing a serious offense. You've put all the passengers at risk. Do you want your mother in prison? I don't want anything to happen to my mother. Neither do we. I promise. But you must help us. - How? - Help us catch the ghost. You'll be all right. You're going after Fernando, I don't know why. But you've come for the dress, so you must know when the ghost will next appear. Every night, Fernando visits the telegraph room before retiring to his cabin. They want to surprise him in the hallways. They're deserted then. You will take the dress and behave as usual. And you must not tell anyone we've spoken. Understood? Simón, understood? I've ordered Varela to find out who attacked Ms. Lenormand. You won't mind if I pursue my own investigation using people I trust? You don't trust Detective Varela? A parallel investigation would allow us to combine our efforts, wouldn't you agree? We would all benefit. You're the captain, so I suppose it's your right. If it's any help, when that woman was hit, I was in my office with my sister. You can ask her. I'm not accusing you of anything, Mr. Fábregas. But I will be ruthless with whoever attacked Casandra. Regardless of whom. Even if it's the very owner of this ship. - Sebastián. - Fernando. I know what you're going to say. - I owe a lot of money... - No, no, no. Don't worry. I wanted to see if you were all right. Whether you need anything. No. Thank you. I made a terrible mistake and I plan to fix it. Verónica. Verónica, are you there? Open up, please. Let me explain. Verónica, I know I've behaved appallingly. But I don't want to lose you. Open up, please. How could I have been so stupid? How could I have been so blind, Mother? Sometimes we don't see the things that are right in front of us. And poor Dimas. I keep thinking about him. He must be feeling awful. I saw him enter his cabin. He didn't look well. But, child, you must think of yourself now. You've been terribly let down. You need to recover. And be very, very, proud. You did right by throwing the ring at him. Mother... I was going to marry him for you. For me? Yes, because I thought that if I married Sebastián, then you'd never need to work again. Come now. I'll fetch you an herb tea. It'll do you good. Dimas. I understand you're angry, but let me explain something, one little thing, please. Please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry but that usurer is... - Arturo is a shark! - Leave. If you're blaming Arturo, then we have nothing to discuss. Leave! I said leave! Pst. Agustín, I need your help. Yes, Officer. Who is berthed in cabin three? Let's see. Well. What is it? There's no one in cabin three. What? Thanks, Agustín. It seems we have another ghost. I hope Simón helps us. He had better. Where's the bow? I don't know. I must have lost it when the officer was chasing me. Never mind. There isn't much time. We must act tonight. You're in charge of the electric panel. Have you found the one for that area? Of course. - I'll signal you when it's time. - Okay. - You know the entry and exit points? - Yes. - The door is the one... - The service door at the prow. I'll put on the dress. Go down the stairs. And I'll pass it to you when I leave. You'll tell me when Fábregas is on the way. Simón? Yes, yes, of course. Are you all right? Yes, perfectly. You're certain? Nothing must go wrong today. I'm certain. I thought you'd stopped drinking. In truth, people seem less disagreeable when I drink. You should try it. You don't care, do you? No, Pierre, of course I care. But I'm not to blame for Clara not wanting to see you. At least explain to her that what happened yesterday was a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding. I see I was wrong about you. It's a shame. Because for a moment I thought that perhaps... But all of us are wrong about things. You about Clara. What? She's not the little innocent you think she is. What do you mean? Clara would never deceive me. What? What happened? No. No, no. She asked me not to tell you. Tell me what? About her thing with my husband. What are you talking about? Pierre. Clara and Aníbal were a couple before they boarded the ship. But Aníbal refused to leave me for her. She started making things up and what happened, happened. I allowed Varela to blackmail me in order to protect Clara. I was here, drinking, when she killed him. You're feeling much better already. Yes. Yes, I'm better. I'm pleased. I shall say this to you. Don't accuse my brother without proof. You don't want me as your enemy. Don't listen to her. She sometimes drinks too much. - Are you well? - No. No, no, I'm not well. Carolina. - Something terrible is happening again. - Are you talking about that woman? Rosa? Listen. Whatever happens, it's important you know that everything I have said and felt for you is real. What's going to happen? You're scaring me. I was looking for you. - What? Is something the matter? - It's Uncle. He's fallen in his cabin. Is he all right? Has he hurt himself? No. Well, he's twisted his ankle. He likes to do everything for himself. - Do you need my help in any way? - No, thanks. Dr. Rojas is already there. And in any case, he only asked to see my sister. Carolina... please, if you have time later, I'd like to finish our talk. Of course. I'm certain this thing with my uncle is nothing. Go. Didn't you say that Uncle was in his cabin? - I'll explain later. - Explain what later? Eva, what is it? You trust me, don't you? So don't say a word. This is about Casandra? It's about the truth. Want to know the truth? Let's go. But why are we here? - Shh. - Trust me. Any telegrams? None, sir. Thank you. Enjoy your watch. Good evening. Hello? Hello? Someone go to the electric panel to fix the lights! Can anyone hear me? What do you want? What do you want? You'll have to come and get me. It's Fernando. Let's go. Fernando! - Which way did she go? - That way. What's happening, Carolina? Don't worry. - You go that way, I'll go this way. - Okay. Stop! It's over. I'm sorry. They know everything. You must have a lot of questions for me. This staircase leads to the cabin above. Carolina Villanueva: timid, anxious, impressionable, rather well prepared. Carolina, I'm sorry. Don't even consider apologizing. You played with me. With all of us. Why? Why have you done this? Yes. Why did you do it? Why? You've been toying with all our emotions. I believed you. Captain, everyone believed her. They planned this meticulously. I really am sorry that I lied. But I had a reason for doing so. What reason? Rosa Marín was my sister. My name is Carmen. Carmen Marín. My sister disappeared two years ago and since then I've done everything possible to find out who killed her. Will you tell them or shall I? - I haven't killed anyone. - But you did know her. - You're in no position to accuse anyone. - Aren't I? Of course you knew her. Stop lying, once and for all. Her family... owned this ship, that's why I knew her. But I didn't kill anyone, I swear. So why did you lie? - Why did you deny everything... - They were accusing me of murder. Anyone in my position would've done the same. Why won't you admit the truth? You deceived my sister, your fiancée, and you deceived everyone. I don't know what she told you, but I had nothing to do with her. My sister loved you and you toyed with her. You used her, and when she became a problem, you killed her. - Just like you wanted to kill me tonight. - No, Mr. Fernando was occupied. - Yes? - He was with his sister then. Of course, his sister, naturally. Of course. But if you believe your sister was killed, why didn't you say so from the start? - Did you go to the police? - I did, but they wouldn't listen, because someone powerful stopped them from investigating. No one believed me. Just like you. No one. It's not a question of whether we believe you. You make unfounded accusations. You're right, Nicolás. It's best we put an end to this. Please return to your cabin. Very well. My sister's body is on this ship, and I intend to find it. And I'll prove that you, Fernando, killed her. Two years ago, at Easter, I said I was going to Barcelona, but I didn't. I was in Vigo with Rosa Marín, a representative from the other shipping company. I know. - Why didn't you tell me the truth? - We had financial problems and your father had just died. - I thought it best... - No, Fernando. Why didn't you tell me that you knew Rosa Marín? I wanted to be discreet. I wanted to avoid anyone telling you something ill-intended. So you saw each other more than once? It was a difficult negotiation. We had to meet a number of times before we could agree. In the end, we became friends. Nothing more. Yes. Nothing more. I see. The important thing is that you were able to secure the purchase. I realize it was a mistake not to tell you about her. We all make mistakes. - What if it's true? - What? Well, everything Casandra says. Fernando has said he knew Rosa Marín. That doesn't mean he killed her. Yes, but... I don't know. To do all that without being sure it was him... They risked their lives by faking a shipwreck. We might not have found them. She was her sister. How far would you go if someone killed Carolina? Carolina is all I have. No. She's not. And you know it. What are you thinking? That we must forget everything that has happened. There's no point going over it all the time. You're right. But until we know what happened to Rosa, people will continue to accuse me. I don't want to go through that again. I need to know what happened. It's best for her. And for her sister. I agree. Yes, come in. Agustín. Captain, I have something to tell you. Yes, what is it? I was the person in cabin three. I came on the ship with Rosa Marín, but she never got off. Subtitle translation by Andrés Galliano
