 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [playing romantic tune] [Sebastián] Mm. It's funny. This is where we met on that first night. Do you remember? You were looking for the North Star and I invited you for a glass of champagne. I'm starting to believe in magic. Don't you? It's all right if you don't. [people screaming] [phone ringing] Hello. What?

 [sighs] Is something wrong? People on deck say they've seen the ghost. This is the final straw. - Now it's time you believed me. - No, don't start! - Fernando... - The matter is closed. Do you understand? But... [water running] MURDERER Fernando, you're right. I... [gasps] What kind of stupid prank is this? I've had enough! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, darling.

 I really am sorry. [horn blowing] We need a way to stem this fear among the passengers, because someone claims to have seen something. Not someone. A few people, all in the same place. - And you believe them? - Why wouldn't I believe them? There's no dead woman! No dead woman, and no murderer. Clear? There's no need to raise your voice. Captain, are you all right? Captain. I can steer a ship through a storm, but other things I can't steer. Captain, we have a duty to keep this ship safe. We've received complaints from passengers who say they have had items stolen. - Believing in ghosts doesn't help. - I talked to Carmen yesterday. What are you saying? That I was able to get her back for an instant, thanks to Casandra. Captain, please, that woman is deceiving you. I know it's difficult to understand, but it was Carmen. - How do you know? - I know, Nicolás, because... I was happy for an instant. I need you to understand. You don't understand. - Yes, I do. - No, you don't understand. - Leave me, please. - Captain. I said, leave me. CHANGE HANDS Let us do our work. Please. [people chattering] I've never been treated like a common thief before. If you've done nothing, no need for concern. [Marino] Sir. That's my watch. My father gave it to me for my Communion. It's true. Check the inscription. Simón Maldonado. May 5, 1936. Fine. We're finished here. [Francisca] My daughter wouldn't make it up. A ghost or whatever. But there's no doubt she saw a woman wearing a white dress covered in blood. Calm down. I already told you that the first officer has everything in hand. - He spoke to the witnesses last night. - [Francisca] What have you found? We're working on that. But I assure you there is an explanation. Now, if you would excuse me. [people murmuring] A challenging day. I heard what happened. Yes, it's been a difficult few days for everyone. Pierre, I was looking for you because I wanted to say that... I'm sorry for the way I treated you yesterday. You don't deserve it. Clara, I understand it's going to take time to get over all this, but I know you will. You have your whole life ahead of you. Our life. Our life. Yes. You look very pretty. I'm pleased that you'll sing again. I realized that the only time I can forget everything is when... I'm on-stage. Everyone forgets everything when you start to sing. They can't stop staring at you. Pierre. You'll always be by my side, won't you? Of course. I'm at your side now and always will be. Thank you. That's what I needed to hear, to be certain. To be certain of what, darling? Of the decision I've made. Varela, you're becoming tiresome. I can't wait to reach port. Neither can all the other passengers. Especially since we've had a ghost roaming the hallways. [both chuckling] A ghost. I'm more afraid of actual people. Excuse me. Sit down. That girl, Clara. I've heard she's gone back to work. I thought she had stopped. Huh. She changed her mind. Things are getting back to normal. A change like that, so sudden... She must be up to something. I see that you trust no one. The question is, where has trusting people ever gotten you? They called at midnight. He began to get very upset and went to the bathroom. I followed him to try calm things down. Then I saw that word on the mirror. Carolina, I'm sorry to say this, but it appears to be a message. - From her? - Mm-hm. - From Rosa. - She's accusing Fernando? But Fernando didn't know the woman. Are you sure? Well, I don't want to make accusations without proof, but it is certainly true that when her name was spelled out on the Ouija, he seemed to get very nervous. Fernando isn't capable of murder. Did you ever believe that your father could be a murderer? [Eva] Julián told me that Rosa disappeared two years ago at Easter in Vigo. And where was the ship at that time? In Vigo. Being refurbished. [clears throat] And Fernando? I know that look. You're about to tell me something I won't like. - Last night, on deck... - Nothing happened last night. But people saw her. All that talk about ghosts and spirits has put ideas into people's heads. What if they're not hallucinations? Eva... I saw her too. Casandra insists that someone killed the girl, that her body is on the ship. Casandra... And you believe her? The captain believes every word the woman says, and now you, too. No, I don't believe her. But if she's behind all this, it must be for a reason. What I saw was real. - And it wasn't a ghost. - So, why are you playing along? If she's up to something, it's best if she thinks I believe her. And I need your help. Eva. You can't keep asking me for help, because every time I see you... Yes. You're right. I should go. No. I don't want you to go. Not now, not ever. What do you need? What are you doing? Nothing. Prying. Seeing how all this works. Goodness me, so much is involved in keeping this ship at sea! Yes, yes. It's a lot. Is everything all right? I need you to pull yourself together. Calm down and stop thinking about unaccountable things. Fernando... did you know Rosa Marín? What? Did you know that woman? I can't believe it. How can this be? How can you ask me this? Because I feel like you're hiding things from me. And you promised it wouldn't be like this! That you wouldn't hide anything! Tell me. Did you know Rosa Marín, yes or no? [phone ringing] Hello, yes? [woman] Why did you do this to me, Fernando? I loved you. What is this? - Who is it? - I have to go out. - I'll be right back. - Fernando! Hey! Hey! - Where'd that call come from? - Sorry, Mr. Fábregas, how do you mean? Someone called my cabin and you put the call through. I... I'm sorry, but I haven't put any calls through to your cabin. What do you mean? Are you calling me a liar? Is that it? I'm sorry, but... [Fernando] It was you, right? Excuse me? I don't know what you mean. You do. Why are you doing this? Why do you want to cause chaos on the ship? Some things you can't run away from, Fernando. - I've never run away from anything. - I won't let you speak to her in this way. Please calm down. I am willing to pursue... Pursue whom? Anyone who harms my family. What are you doing here? The question is, what are you doing here all alone? I was worried after last night. - I slept terribly. - Hmm. I had nightmares. That's all over now. From tonight on, you'll sleep in my cabin. Always. - Hmm? - But... why don't we wait until we arrive? Because that can wait, but I can't. I want to announce our engagement today. Everyone must know. What? I don't know. Why? My mother knows, I know, who else needs to know? The whole ship should know. You'll be my wife. It's worth a toast, at the very least. - All right. - Mm. - [Gloria] Simón, no! Please. - No, Mother, no one calls me a thief! Lad, listen to your mother and sit down. Simón, please don't make a scene. And you, pick on someone your own age! He's right. What's happening is your fault. Don't accuse me without proof. These people almost died at sea. They've suffered enough. - They should have left you at sea. - Oh, yes? - Yes. - You think that? And leave my mother to die? They used to burn witches at the stake. And thieves had their hands cut off! Oh! Oh! Simón! You brat, I'm going to kill you! [Julian] Settle down! [Gloria] Let my son go, you lout. Madam, put your son in his cot and wrap him up so he doesn't get cold. Control your son before he gets hurt. - I'll kill him. - Please! - Do something. - I... What can I do? Whatever, do something! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Please! This is no way to resolve matters. Gentlemen! That's it. This is no way to resolve matters. It's important to talk. We can... We're not animals. [softly] Sebastián. Gentlemen, ladies, I understand your concern... but we aren't the problem. Things were happening on this ship before we arrived, weren't they? If destiny has brought me here, it's to help you. Before it's too late. Everything is going to be fine, truly. But you must trust me. Trust us. [Nicolás] That's the hull, Eva. The sea is on the other side. There's no secret room, no matter how hard you look. This was all under construction when Rosa disappeared, right? I suppose so. So it would have been easy to hide a body. This is the ensign of the Covadonga. Yes. They didn't remove them all. I wouldn't go down there. That's where my father is. Yes. - Come on, let's go. - No. I knew you'd come down in the end. You have to check things for yourself, don't you? Let's go, Eva. Yes, let's go. [Carlos] And now you'll want to know the truth about Rosa Marín. What do you know about Rosa Marín? Tell me! - What do you know? - [Nicolás] Leave it, Eva. Let's go. Don't play into his hands. He must have heard the name. [Carlos] You'll be back. Eva, I understand that you want to know what happened, but this is affecting you. Yes, but I can't pretend that I don't care. And my sister is the one being affected. Why your sister? Well, because we think Fernando might have known Rosa. - I don't know. - That is absurd. This thing with Casandra is too much. There should be a simpler explanation. What do you mean? There have been a number of robberies recently. What better way to deflect attention than to talk about ghosts? No, I don't believe Casandra is a common thief. That's more plausible than the idea that a dead woman is roaming the ship. Don't you agree? I saw the bill, I didn't pay attention. I didn't think that Fernando would lie about such a thing. Sometimes I think that I should have never boarded this ship. All that's happened these last few days, it's... as if my life has been turned upside down. Life is constantly changing, Carolina. Accepting those changes is the difficult part. I don't know. I can't do it. I'm not that strong. Yes. Yes, you are. You haven't realized it yet. You have so much to offer, Carolina. And I think people aren't able to see that. You should shout out to the world who you are and what you want. And leave the fear to one side. You can't always do what others expect of you. - Eva. - [Eva] Is something wrong? What's wrong? It's Fernando. He lied to me. He wasn't in Barcelona at the time of the disappearance. He was in Vigo. Here is the hotel bill, and the dates match. This is absurd. And then, that phone call. I don't know who it was. He didn't tell me... but I know someone was there. - He went white and ran out of the room. - Carol, calm down. We're talking about Fernando. I asked him whether he knew Rosa and he told me he didn't, but I know he's hiding something. [Erich] Excuse me. Ms. Lenormand, the captain wants to see you in his cabin. Thank you. I'm coming. Carolina, when a person lies, it's for a reason. Captain, the cards interpret events, but they don't give us answers. You said the cards never lie. They helped me with Carmen. I could speak to her and I know she's at peace. Yes, but that was talking to a presence that is at our side. You're asking me for advice. I'm the only one responsible for my fate, but I want to know what I'm facing here. You told me the ship was in danger. - And it is. - What kind of danger? Is it to do with that woman? That woman is a tormented soul, captain. She needs our help. But negative forces want to prevent that. Negative forces? What negative forces? Place your hand here. [Casandra] The Devil. The Devil. The Devil always seeks to deceive us. Who is the devil? [Casandra] The Emperor. The Emperor reigns over his realm. He rules over everything. Captain, who owns this ship? We must ask ourselves, why is someone so intent on making you appear guilty? What do you mean, someone? Don't you see it's that woman? Fine, then we need to ask ourselves why this woman would believe you to be guilty. Maybe she thinks I did it. - Perhaps you did do it. - I won't tell you again. In fact, you had a motive, didn't you? Most crimes are crimes of passion to some extent. - And you and her... - No, enough! I'm not accusing you. Simply demonstrating that anyone might come to such a conclusion. I am paying you to take care of this, nothing more. I will no longer discuss the matter. And now, please leave my office. [door opens then closes] What are you doing here? Waiting for Ms. Casandra. She's talking to the captain. - [Santiago] Many thanks. - [Casandra] My pleasure. Officer, I need you to increase security measures. Why is that, captain? We are facing an unknown threat and I don't want passengers in danger. Is that what she said? With all due respect, captain, I don't believe this woman offers the most suitable advice. I make the decisions. Is that clear? What are you up to? Excuse me? No, I'm not up to anything. The captain asked to see me and I couldn't refuse my help. Officer, I believe the captain has been more than clear. Scaring passengers with your tall tales is one thing. It's quite another matter when you try to influence the captain's decisions. - You could put us all in danger. - You haven't realized, - have you? - Realized what? We are already in danger. Officer. [knock on door] Come in, darling. Why are you here? Why? Is it an inconvenience? We're friends, right? I suppose we are. Pierre. I've simply come to tell you that life should be enjoyed. What? It would be a big mistake if she were to tell the whole story now. What do you mean? You'd better leave. Of course you know. No one has endured this more than I. But we must look to the future now. And you know you can trust me. But what if she can't go on? So it's true. You will tell the truth. I just want what's best for her. And I don't? I don't know how many times Aníbal hit me, belittled me, humiliated me. If we tell the truth, Aníbal will have won. What would we gain? Prison? I understand. [Pierre] Clara! [door opens] - Clara! - [door slams] Clara, please! [sobs] [Carlos] You can't help yourself, can you? I knew you'd come back. I'm here for my sister. What do you know about Rosa Marín? If you know something, you must tell me. Everything changes hands, daughter. What do you mean? Everything changes hands, and ownership. Do you mean the ship? It changed ownership. I understand your reservations, but this man is being detained in unsanitary conditions. [Santiago] He'll stay in that cage. I don't trust him. I don't want to endanger anyone. Sorry, Pedro, I know he's your brother... He ceased being my brother some time ago. If you think he should stay there, we won't discuss the matter. I know what Carlos did was awful, but we can't treat him like that. I'm sorry. The decision has been made. Gentlemen. Don't give it any more thought. I'm a doctor, Pedro. It's my duty to worry about people's health. Everyone's health. When you poisoned my niece, what were you then? - Are you always going to tell me that? - Until my dying day. Going blind has made me more mistrustful, not more stupid. I will never trust my brother. And if you keep insisting, I shall mistrust you, too. Can you see me? I don't need to see you to know the expression on your face. [breathes deeply] So, what are you thinking, sir? I still can't believe it. I'm about to announce my engagement. If anyone had told me this before... With all due respect, sir, I hardly recognize you when you speak. You, who never wanted to commit to any woman. This is different. Verónica is... a special woman. What I feel for her... No, no. I don't know how to explain it. I know I want to be with her. How are the wardrobes coming along? Will she move in today? Yes, of course. I'll take all this to the storeroom and Verónica can move in today. When you've finished here, take the night off, Dimas. Thank you, sir. Thank you. - It's going to be splendid. - Yes. [door closes] TELEGRAM This is Mr. Sebastián's bill. It includes the flowers from this morning. He hasn't paid anything? Mr. de la Cuesta hasn't spared any expense: bar and restaurant service, jewelry, the tailor. He even hired a violinist. De la Cuesta must be very good friends with Mr. Fábregas. Why do you say that? Because passengers usually put down a credit against which payments are taken. However, Mr. de la Cuesta hasn't left a deposit. He's been charging everything to his account. If he wanted, he could leave without paying? Well, we rely on his word as a gentleman. Right. His word as a gentleman, yes. [elegant music playing] Gentlemen, please. Thank you. I am delighted to have you here. As you know, the reason for this gathering, friends... [Dimas] Friends? How dare you speak of friendship? Does she know she's marrying a scoundrel? Does she? I'm pleased you could come. Liar! Thief! Did you hear me? Sebastián de la Cuesta is a thief! Wait. Please, go to sleep, you're drunk. You should know that Sebastián has used me. He said he'd be my partner so he could steal the patent for my machine. Dimas, please. It's a private matter, sorry for the trouble. - You should apologize to me! - [Arturo] Hey, lad, lad! Go to your cabin. Before things get out of hand. I trusted you, sir. And you betrayed me. You never planned to invest. He's broke! Broke. [Verónica] Did you steal Dimas' idea? It's a misunderstanding. You said you would be my partner and then sold the patent to someone called Arturo. How are you involved in this? No, no, no. Don't look at me. I'm a businessman. If you want an explanation, your fiancé is here. Between them, they planned to keep my business and give me the boot. Dimas. [Verónica] Is this true? I said, is this true, Sebastián? Look, I don't care that you're broke. Because I wasn't with you for your money. But I'll never forgive what you have done to Dimas. Don't even say that you already knew. My job almost exclusively involves knowing things that other people don't know. We cannot allow Carla to talk. We won't allow it. So, what will we do? That depends, Mrs. Fábregas. On what? On how far you are prepared to go. Varela, just tell me what you are thinking. I don't have time for games. For me, from now on, only one person is responsible for your husband's death. Clara. So... we need to persuade everyone else to believe that very thing. We would need to fabricate some incriminating evidence, of course. And you would be willing to do this? I can't pay you any more money. Do you remember that ghost? Yes. What does that have to do with this? If you play your cards right, you could prevail. What do you mean? You could end up the sole proprietor of this shipping company. [knock on door] Who's there? It's Casandra. Hello. Hello. - May I come in? - Yes, yes, come in. I was coming to see how you are. Fine. I'm fine. You sure you're fine? The truth is... I don't know. I don't know anything. Carolina, life is continually changing and we must always make choices. But how? How do I know what the right choice is? You know. Deep down, we always know. You just need the courage to make it. What's she doing here? I just came to see how Carolina was. Excuse me. Are you well? Yes. Just... a little dizzy, that's all. [knocking on door] Fernando? Fernando? Naval Yearbook, 1944. Juan Marín, owner of the Covadonga. Eva. Were you looking for me? Yes. Yes, I wanted to talk to you. Of course. The previous owner of this ship was called Juan Marín. There's a link between Rosa and this ship. Well, Marín is a very common surname. Yes, but neither of us believes in chance, do we? His surname is Marín and she's appeared on this ship. There has to be a connection. Yes. Yes, you're right. It can't be a coincidence. Is this the brooch you lost? Yes. Yes, it is. - Where was it? - In a hallway. In a hallway. Goodness, I must have dropped it. Only, I just saw a photograph and... the previous owner was wearing one. Such a coincidence that you have one, too. I told you that I was on the Covadonga. Of course. But not everyone has a brooch like this. Well, it's just... it was a gift from the captain. We became close friends and he wanted to give me a token. I'd rather not provide any details, but I would like it back. Of course. Of course, it's yours. Thank you. I'll tell the captain. Eva, I feel you have begun to... to doubt me again. Me? No. Not at all. But I think we all want to know what happened to Rosa Marín, don't we? Right, right. You shouldn't investigate this alone. Could be dangerous. Don't worry. - I can take care of myself. - I'm sure. Well. Have a good evening. You too. [closing theme playing] Subtitle translation by Andrés Galliano
