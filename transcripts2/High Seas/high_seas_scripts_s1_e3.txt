 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Attention, please. Gentlemen, please! Be quiet! Let's see. Yelling won't help. If we want to figure this out, we must cooperate. We just want to talk with someone who knows Manuel well. We believe he's innocent. I know him. We share a cabin, and we've known each other since we were kids. - What's your name? - Dimas. Dimas Gómez.

 We were just chatting in our cabin, minding our own business, and suddenly, a man walked in and asked me to leave. - Just like that? - Yes, just like that. - What happened then? - I went up to Mr. Sebastián's cabin. I brought him a bottle of champagne, he had a date. And when I got back, I found out he had been arrested. - Who was the man? Did you know him? - No. Well, he was asking for our documents when we were locked in here. Varela. Manuel told us someone paid him to take the blame. Nothing happened until Varela walked in. - Do you think he paid him to confess? - It could be. - But why would he do that? - I don't know. It doesn't make sense. I have to leave. I must get ready for dinner.

 I'll go speak with Manuel. He's a good kid. I'm sure I can persuade him to tell me who paid him off. I've also done some stupid things to survive. - And if you need me, just whistle. - I will. Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death. Amen. - Holy Mary... - It's a beautiful night. Do you want to go out? I was saying a Rosary for poor Luisa. If I were her mother, I would like someone to do that for her. Would you like me to stay? Come on, what will you do in here? Go upstairs, they must be waiting for you. What's this? A photograph I took from your father's office. He looks so happy. I wanted a memento. - Yes. - Uncle Pedro. - I have to talk to you. - Of course, child. - But outside. I need some fresh air. - All right. Have a good evening. Is something wrong? Francisca kept this with her things. - Uncle, where was this picture taken? - In Berlin. Your father and I did some business there these past few years. Footwear. - We sold them footwear. - I know. SOFIA If we'd known who they were, and what they did, we wouldn't have dealt with them, but we didn't. Neither your father, nor I. Actually, I didn't want to ask you about the business. I want to know who she is. That's Sofía, the German interpreter that was hired by the company. - Sofía? - Sofía Plazaola, yes. She traveled with us on many occasions. Why? She's the girl that we got on board. And now she's dead. She was the stowaway? Are you sure? Completely sure. I don't understand how she could do something like this. I don't know, uncle. I don't know, and I was expecting you could tell me. Now that I know you knew her. Did you talk to Varela? Although I doubt he can be of much help, considering the boy has confessed. No, I haven't talked to him. I guess you're right. I'll talk to my sister. Thank you, uncle. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. Open the door, please. Breathe. Breathe! Breathe! If she knew Dad and Uncle Pedro, then she knew who we were. And she knew we'd get on this ship. It wasn't a coincidence. She faked the accident so we'd help her sneak on. She made up that story about her husband and I fell for it like an idiot. You are a good person, and you wanted to help. - Don't think about it too much. - I don't understand why she lied. If she had told the truth, we would've helped her. - Clearly, she was looking for something. - What? I don't know. I don't know, Eva, but maybe... Maybe we should talk to Detective Varela and tell him everything. I don't think so. - Why? - I don't trust him. I don't think that the boy they arrested was involved in Luisa's death. I think we should find out on our own what that girl was looking for in our things. Who is it? Nicolás. It's Manuel. He hadn't been dead for an hour. I'm sorry this happened. Doctor, I don't know what's going on. All I know is that this man took my friend and now he's dead. You better go to bed. Don't make things worse. Make things worse? My friend is dead. It can't get worse. - What's going on in here? - My friend is dead. He's dead! I want to know how he died, because I don't believe him. - Come with me. - No! I want to know how he died! Come with me! Listen to me. Listen to me! I also think something's odd, but you better leave. I'll handle it. Fine. Dimas. What's wrong? Manuel is dead. They say he killed himself, but I don't believe that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I have to go. It's late. I'm sorry about your friend. That boy was innocent. - He didn't kill Luisa. - We don't know that for sure, Eva. Why do you say that? He confessed, I was there. I talked to him. He said someone paid him to take the blame. How did you talk to him? I see. You can't be here. Since when is the captain not allowed to be wherever he wants to be? We must get the body down to the refrigerator now, captain. It can't be kept here any longer. Did you notice this? He already had those wounds when we arrested him. He said he'd been in a fight. I told the doctor about it, and he made it clear that the boy... had died by hanging. It's great when everything adds up. It makes things much easier. - Implying something? - Officer. Last night, you were guarding the prisoner's door, weren't you? Yes, sir. When the first officer arrived, I was at my post. And I guess you didn't leave your post. No, sir. Not for a minute. And you didn't see anybody go into the cabin, of course. Only the first officer, and well, the boy had already hanged himself. You are dismissed. A suicide, and case closed. Don't you find it too convenient, captain? - What do you suggest? - I don't know. I think a crew member should be in charge of the investigation. And I guess you want to do that yourself. If you are not against it, I think it'd be best. In a normal situation, I'd do anything for my crew. But clearly, whatever is going on here is not a normal situation. Please, be discreet. Yes, captain. He sustained wounds to his fists, his nails were broken. Varela says he got those from a fight before he was arrested. But I'm not sure. When we went to the cell, I didn't notice if he already had those wounds. I didn't either. Luisa's real killer could've faked Manuel's suicide so they would close the case. We think it might have something to do with this. That's your Uncle Pedro. And this was our father. It was taken a few days before he died. They used to sell footwear to the Germans. - The woman standing with them is Luisa. - Luisa? So your father knew her? According to my uncle, she was hired as a German interpreter. It's obvious she was looking for something. Something you have. These are my father's things. The company's documents. We took them from the hold and we've read them a thousand times, but... We didn't find anything. - Yes? - Uncle Pedro has arrived. Just one moment, Uncle. I'll be right there. I'd prefer it if he didn't see me here. I don't want trouble. Hide in the bathroom. I felt the need to know how you were. We're a little nervous, honestly. What's all that? You won't find anything in those documents. I went through them when your father passed away. If my brother had any secrets, he took them to the grave. But there must be something somewhere. You were with him during his last days. Did he say anything? Did you notice anything? No, he acted normally. We celebrated my birthday at home, Francisca made a cake, as usual. Francisca's cakes, yes. Well... He also gave you that pendant. Yes. I'm starving, uncle. Join me for breakfast? I already had breakfast. But I'll gladly keep you company. - Are you coming, Eva? - No. I'll write for a while. My novel's coming along. When will you let me read it? As soon as it's ready, you'll be first. Let's go. Let's go. What is it? If Manuel fought the guy who killed him, - there might be some traces in the cell. - Let's go check it out. Shit. Hold this. It'll be just a moment. I still can do it. Sit down. Sit down for a moment. You'll be Manuel, and I'll be the killer. - How did you get in? - Through the door. The guard said he didn't leave his post. Never mind. We'll deal with that later. We're talking. We know each other. And I have a belt inside a pocket in my blazer. I walk around you. I stand behind you. And with a swift movement, I put it around your neck. You try to resist. I pull hard. But now it's too late. Your plan would be perfect, if not for a small detail. Maybe someone got in here to help him escape, but they started fighting. It's not screwed on. - Where does this duct lead to? - It's the heating. It connects all cabins, leads to the hold. Look. What's this? Anyone who wanted to come in could've done it through there. Not anybody. Only someone who knows this ship very well. Someone from the crew. I'm so sorry. This evening, I won't be able to sing. My voice is not doing well. I hope that with some rest, tomorrow I will be fully recovered. I will leave you with our great band. Enjoy your evening, see you tomorrow. Excuse me. That's how you say hello to friends that are worried about your health? I hope you didn't tell your boyfriend about what happened between us. He looks so in love. Can you imagine how hurt he'd feel if he knew his girlfriend beds anyone? You are a pig. I like it when you get like this. - Why are you doing this to me? - Me? I have done nothing to you. It was you. You came to my cabin. What do you think a woman wants when she walks alone into a man's cabin? You tricked me. No. I said I could help you. And I still can. You could become a famous singer, make lots of money, and marry your boyfriend. Or I can have you both fired for accusing me of something I didn't do. It's up to you. Everything all right? Yes, I've been informed of our dear singer's health issues, and I came over to ask her about them. We are working on a beautiful project, and I'd hate to see it ruined. No, I don't think that'll happen. It's probably just the ocean breeze. It causes a lot of sore throats. Is that right, Clara? It's probably just that. Listen to me and get some rest. Don't make it worse. Are you okay? Yes. Everything's fine. You look so somber. And you have such a pretty smile. I want to get some rest. Of course. I'll leave you to it. If you need anything, let me know. It seems so calm, doesn't it? With all the things that are surely happening under the surface. The ocean's never calm. Even if it seems so. That's what our father used to say. He was afraid we would be dragged by a current while we were bathing. That boy was not a thief, much less a killer. Did you pay him to confess? Why did you lie to us, Fernando? The cable was a laundry slip. Don't tell your sister, please. I'll explain, but not right now. Why not? I swear it has nothing to do with the girl's death. Sorry for the delay, sir. But poached eggs take time. It's me who's poached, Dimas. Don't worry about it. Good things take time, isn't that what they say? What's the matter? You look like you're in a rush. Are you having a bad day? No, sir. Nothing that can't be fixed. Dimas, please. I'm not just your boss. I'm your friend. You can tell me anything. Everything can be fixed. The arrested man has killed himself. We were close. I see. If you don't mind, I'd rather change the subject. It's obvious that your night was a lot better. Well, not so much, Dimas. Appearances can be deceiving. - You didn't enjoy the company? - Yes, very much. - She's a lovely young lady, right? - Verónica? She's lovely, and pretty. Very, very pretty. The only problem is that she doesn't like to have as much fun as I expected. Not that I didn't try. But she spent the entire night talking. It was amazing. She talks more than me. Anyway, what can we do? Yes, what can we do? There are plenty of beautiful women here. Forget about that girl, sir. As you say, "There's plenty of fish." Plenty of fish. But few tunas, Dimas. Anyway, I like a challenge. As I say, we shouldn't give up so easily. Right? NOVEL Go on deck! Take the stairs! - Where's the smoke coming from? - Go on deck. That's our cabin! Evacuate the deck! - Get out of my way! - I think they're inside. - Clear the corridors! Go out immediately! - Eva! - Go on deck! - Eva! Eva! Make way! Make way, please! Please cooperate. You heard the officer. Back off. - Someone call Dr. Rojas. - No need, captain. Eva. - Eva, please wake up. - Allow me. Eva, wake up. Eva. Eva. Eva. Tell me I don't need an injection. She needs some rest. There's nothing to worry about. She just inhaled some smoke. Jiménez, Plazaola, go help with the fire. Did she say anything? How the fire started, or if she saw anyone? If she saw anyone? What do you mean, uncle? I don't know. Honestly, I don't know. So much has happened in such short period of time. One doesn't know what the hell to think. Since you showed me that photograph, I can't stop thinking. What matters is that Eva is fine. She'll recover. Yes. I better go get some rest before dinner. Rest well, uncle. What photograph was he talking about? It's nothing. - Are you nervous? - No. Why would I be? The linden blossom tea. People drink that sometimes when they're nervous. It's for Miss Eva. How is she? I wanted to visit, but I imagined too many people would be there. She's fine. She was sleeping when I left. You've worked for them for many years, right? All my life. Things were different when I was a kid, of course. Mother has worked there since she got pregnant. I was raised there. Were you upstairs when the fire started? It was a miracle I wasn't caught in it. I was lucky. I'm the lucky one. Why you? Because you weren't harmed. And we can have dinner again, if you'd like. I'm sure you have a lot to tell me. Well. Last night, I talked too much already. No. No one's ever told you it's inappropriate to come into a lady's bedroom? A lady? I'm afraid I don't see any. If you hadn't saved my life, I would kick you out right now. But considering that, I forgive you. I'm glad to see you are fine. What's this? I don't know. It occurred to me you could use it to write your new book. Thank you. I don't know if I'll feel up to it. Sometimes it's best to start anew. To turn over a new leaf. Well. I guess you have a lot to do. Yes. Lots. I guess you're tired. Yes, very. See you later, then. Of course. I thought it was an official meeting. Mr. Aníbal de Souza is a shareholder. Are we here to talk about money, or about the safety of 1600 people? Thanks to the money I've invested, the alarm systems functioned properly and a tragedy was avoided. I think I have a right to be in this meeting. The situation is very serious. The fire has confirmed that the safety of anyone on board cannot be guaranteed. I think you're exaggerating the situation. - Don't interrupt me. - Go ahead, captain. What has happened has forced me to come to a decision that I imagine won't be to your liking, given its financial consequences. What do you mean? We must get back to port immediately, and let the authorities handle this. - He doesn't know what he's saying. - No, captain. We won't do that. We committed to take all the passengers to Brazil. You also committed to ensuring their safety. - You're not achieving that. - I will. We'll reinforce security, and investigate every passenger that seems suspicious. How do you intend to do that? We have 1600 passengers on board. Are you going to check them one by one? I'll tell you. It's not possible. Look. Fernando, two people have died. There's been a fire. Do you think I'm exaggerating? The only way for us to have no further regrets is to get back to port. Give me two hours, captain. Do you know how much it would cost to get back to port? - Do you know? - Yes. I'm not an idiot. I've invested a lot of money, and I'm not willing to lose it. I'm not an idiot. - Do you think it was arson? - I don't know. But clearly, we've been very lucky. If the fire had spread, we'd all be on lifeboats by now. What's wrong? My father's box. It was on this table. Is it this one? Yes. These are all the documents of my father's company. All his personal business. Eva must have saved this before her book. Is this a list of employees? I guess so. Yes. Look. Sofía Plazaola. Where have I heard that name? The woman that claimed to be Luisa. The stowaway that fell overboard. No, no. It's not that. Plazaola. It's the last name of one of the sailors. We hired him last minute, someone didn't show up. I interviewed him. - Tell me you weren't involved. - I swear I didn't know she was in there. Are you crazy? You almost killed my niece. Wasn't it enough to search the cabin? The only way to not get us compromised is to destroy it. She was looking for you. That girl is dead! Sure, and you believe she was working alone? Someone searched your nieces' trunks this morning. I told you it's not over. What if they've already found what they wanted? If they had, we would know. I can assure you. I won't end up in jail, Pedro. If I have to burn the ship, I will. I have a responsibility towards our passengers. We are heading back to port! I want to turn five degrees to starboard. We're turning around. It must be unnoticeable. Do you understand? - Do you understand? - Yes, captain. Sir. - Are you all right? - Listen to me, idiot. It's an order! Where is Plazaola? Have you seen him? His shift doesn't start until tomorrow. Thank you. This way. Don't worry. I'll ask someone to replace the bulbs. This way. Mario! Mario Plazaola? - It's me. What is it? - I have some questions. Do you know her? I can't see. This woman. No, I have never seen her. Sure. Turns out she came aboard this ship. And you share a last name. What a coincidence. If you don't mind, my shift is about to start. He has no intention of cooperating. - I'll talk to him again. - I'll come. No. It's best if I go alone. You know the way back? - Yes, I guess. - All right. What have I gotten myself into?
