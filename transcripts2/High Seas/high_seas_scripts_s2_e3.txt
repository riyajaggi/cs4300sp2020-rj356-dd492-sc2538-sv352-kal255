 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Calm down, Carolina. Just stop and listen. You're very upset. I'm upset that none of you believe a word I say! Is there any problem? People heard screams. There's a dead woman in our cabin. Everyone stay in their cabins, and come with us. Back to your cabins, everyone. Now you'll see I'm not lying. Here, let me do it.

 That's not possible. She was here. She was here! - There was blood everywhere. - Perhaps it was a dream. It wasn't a dream. I saw her. You must believe me! There's nothing here, Carolina. See? There's no one here. But why? Why would I make it up? No one said you were making it up. Maybe you're very tired and need a little sleep. Don't treat me as though I were a child! I know very well what I saw! [Casandra] What did she look like?

 - [Fernando] You can't come in here. - That's for her to decide. Carolina, I could sense you needed my help. What was she like? She was lying face down so I couldn't see her face, but... but she had dark hair. [Casandra] Was she wearing a white dress? With a green sash? Yes. How do you know? I've seen her too. Carolina, out of all of us, that woman chose you, to tell you something. Me? Yes. But don't worry. I can help. What is that? [Casandra] A Ouija board. It's a way to connect to the other side. The spirit world. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. [Carolina] Eva, please. Your sister's right. This is no time for games. With all due respect, Fernando, this isn't a game. Any type of negative energy might attract unwelcome guests. And yet we already have those. [Carolina] Eva, please, enough! I would prefer for you to be here, but not like this! - Do you really agree with this? - No, but what can I do? They're going to do it anyway. [Casandra] Officer, will you join us? No. I prefer to watch from a distance. - Hope you know what you're doing. - Yes, of course. We will now close our eyes and take three deep breaths. IS ANYBODY THERE? Very good. Let's begin. Place your index finger on the pointer, please. [Fernando sighs] [Casandra] Everyone at this table wants to hear what you have to say. So, please, don't be afraid to communicate with us. Are you there? [women gasp] - Sorry. - What was that? [Casandra] It's all right. Are you there? [Carolina] Ask whether she's the woman I saw earlier. Is your body still on the ship? What's your name? Rosa, what? Marín. Rosa Marín. [thump] [sighs] [Carolina] Help. - Help. - [Erich] Help. Enough. We must stop. - [Carolina] Why? - [Erich] It's too dangerous. [Casandra] Rosa, thank you. Thank you for coming and talking to us but we need you to say goodbye now. [Carolina sighs] What is it? What if she doesn't say goodbye? If we don't close the séance, then someone from the other side can come at any time. [Casandra gasping] Let me out. Please, let me out. Please. - Do something. - [Erich] Calm down, Casandra. [Casandra groans then panting] - What happened? - Come and rest. Tell me what happened. What happened? [Carolina] I think that woman was trying to talk through you. [Nicolás] Right, that's enough. Come on. It's late, please return to your cabins. - Excuse us. - [Casandra gasps] - [Nicolás] Where are you going? - I need to see how she is. She's perfectly fine, of course. Sometimes we try so hard to understand certain things that our minds can't grasp, - but it's no use. - Do you hear yourself? Yes. And I would like your support, not have you stare at me as if I was a circus freak! I don't know how you have been deceived by this woman. I haven't been deceived! I saw a dead woman in my cabin this evening! And you've seen what just happened here! Yet she's the only one who seems to believe me. Casandra, it's me. Carolina. I've brought you some food. Thank you. But there really was no need. It's the least I can do. Carolina, come in, please. I brought you some broth and toast and a little fruit. To build up your strength. There was no need. Thank you, Carolina, you're an angel. - [Erich] Good night, madam. - Good night. Come. Sit, please. I'm very afraid, Carolina. We opened a door and couldn't close it, and now anything could happen. Like what? Like evil spirits coming and hurting people. Perhaps if we could find her, - the door would close, wouldn't it? - No. It's best not to keep intruding in the world of the dead. It's best for us both. I'm sorry, but I can't just pretend nothing happened. You said it yourself. That woman chose me. I can't let her down. So we won't let her down. You're a being of light, Carolina. And that's the only way to vanquish the dark. I can't abide impostors. Did you see how the table moved? Are you suggesting this was all real? Of course not, Eva. But they made it happen somehow. I spoke to Casandra. She admitted to having been on the ship before. It can't be a coincidence. If they're hiding something, we'll find out. They can't fool everyone. I'm most worried about my sister. That look on her face, I don't recognize it. She doesn't recognize herself. - Be patient. - I'm tired of being patient, with you, with her, with everyone. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I know it's not easy for you either. Have you replied to her telegram yet? No. Not yet. Do it. It's not fair to make her wait. [clicking] Officer, how can I help? I need to send a telegram. To Rio. [Verónica] May I sit with you? - Why do you ask? - You look so grumpy. Come on. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing's wrong. You have something to tell me. Me? Well, let me see... I got up, washed, and had breakfast. An ordinary day. What else is there? I see Mr. Sebastián hasn't said anything. Said anything about what? Nothing, nothing. I didn't say or know anything. Don't know anything? Dimas! What does he have to say? - Let me pass, please. - No. - Not until you tell me. - Don't be a nuisance. I'm in a rush. Dimas, please. - Can you tell me? - He's going to propose to you. Now let me go. Please. What will you say? Why do you ask? No reason. [Sebastián] Mrs. Francisca. Good day. Are you well? Do you know where I might find your daughter? - I can't find her anywhere. - [Francisca] That makes two of us. - But we're in luck. - We are? [stammers] No, it's... it's... we're in luck because... because my daughter... is usually in the cabin with the ladies at this time, helping. Very well. Thank you. What on earth are you up to? I just don't want to see him. Did he do something and wants to apologize? No, Mother, it's not that. Why are you hiding, then? Sebastián is going to propose to me. Isn't that what you wanted? To leave this intolerable, as you call it, life of a servant? Mother. What's the matter? Well, yes, of course I want a better life, but I don't know if I want it with him. I don't know, Sebastián has always treated me well and been kind. He says he loves me, but I... But you don't know. When you love someone, you know. That's the advice I have for you. Finding someone who really loves you is the greatest thing. Once, I saw something like this in the house of an old friend in Buenos Aires. The chandelier fell onto the table. I almost had a heart attack. And he spoke as if he were my friend's mother. He said things that only he knew... Excuse me, captain. But I don't believe in such things. Don't you think it's presumptuous to believe all that exists is what we see? It's absurd. I respect your opinion, but find it hard to take this type of thing seriously. In any case, I don't think it helps for the passengers to hear rumors of ghosts roaming the ship. Well, for now, let's give things time to settle. If it happens again, - let me know? - Of course. Excuse me, captain, a telegram has arrived from Conakry. Yes. Now they really have some explaining to do. [Fernando] I already checked. There's no trick. This is going too far. My sister is different since that woman came onboard. I tried to understand Carolina, put myself in her shoes. - We must put an end this. - And what will you do? I don't know. I can't stop her from seeing that woman. Mr. Fernando, a telegram has arrived. [Casandra] Thank you, captain. I find this very difficult to talk about. If you did no wrong, there's no need to worry. Get to the point. We received a telegram from the authorities in Conakry. No one has heard of your ship. How is that possible? I said that we sailed from Conakry, Mr. Fábregas, not that we sailed from the port. Of course. Our ship, the Victoria, was waiting for us on this side of Tamara. We reached the east coast in dinghies and then had to cross the island on foot. Were you on the run? No. But we did help a group of political exiles escape certain death. Misfortune then carried them to the bottom of the sea. I find this very hard to believe. Fernando. They almost died. You saw them when they boarded the ship. Yes, we saw them board. Now we're finding out why they did. That's the problem, isn't it? You'll try to discredit Casandra no matter what she says. This is neither the time nor the place for arguments. Thank you for explaining. You're welcome. I'll be on deck if you need any information. Captain, I'd quite forgotten, a brooch that is of enormous sentimental value to me has gone missing. - [Santiago] Do you think someone took it? - [Casandra] I know I haven't lost it. I don't accuse people without proof. Good afternoon. [door opens, then closes] I hope you're satisfied and won't inconvenience her again. As far as I'm concerned, Ms. Lenormand explained everything. Captain, we can't simply take this woman at her word. Why not? [Fernando] I'm afraid that I agree with the first officer. I would like telegrams sent to all ports on the African coast. The Victoria, if it even exists, must be registered somewhere. It shall be done, as you wish. [Eva] She says she saw a dead woman in her cabin. It makes no sense. Your sister is a sensible woman. Are there such things as mental illnesses that might cause people to see visions or...? [Rojas] Yes, of course. Hallucinations could be a sign of schizophrenia. Eva, aren't you taking this a little far? Might it be hereditary? No, there's no history of mental illness in our family. - What about Father? - No. I can't help thinking that with everything he did that perhaps he too... [Rojas] Your father is perfectly sane, Eva. You don't have to be mentally ill to do that sort of thing. What you've said about your sister seems very worrying. If you wish, I can examine or talk to her. I would rather you stayed well away. What should we do, Uncle? For now, let's take a stroll along the deck. A little fresh air would do us good, don't you think? But I can't help worrying. Well, you're right, fresh air will be good. Let's go. - [Eva] This way. - [Pedro] Very good. Good. - [Rojas] How many months along are you? - It doesn't matter. Why have you been hiding it? I didn't want anyone to know. Why? Who's the father? Carlos. You've known everything from the beginning. You knew exactly who Carlos was. He didn't fool you. What do you want? I'd like to discuss the things we have in common. In common? I don't think you and I have much in common. I disagree. We're both going to have a lot of explaining to do once we reach Brazil. Don't take this the wrong way, but... I think you may come out of this very badly. I told the captain that I'd accept the full consequences of my actions. I don't think you're aware that it's highly likely that you'll spend the rest of your life in prison. Is that what you want? I'm offering you the chance to save yourself. We can all be saved. I suppose by "all" you also mean Carlos? Think about it. We can help each other. Thank you for putting your faith in me. It's not all that usual. People are very skeptical. Look. The arcana help us communicate with our loved ones. Place your hand here, please. Very good. The Hermit. See this here? That is the hermit's lantern. It means that... that Carmen wasn't ready to go on this journey. She suddenly found herself immersed in darkness. Was her death unexpected? I got home to find her on the floor. Her heart had stopped and there was nothing I could do. The Sun. Don't worry, captain. Carmen has gone into the light. And she's resting in peace. I can't help thinking that she'd still be alive if I hadn't gone out that evening. No. And she wants you to know that it's not your fault. You were not responsible. I can't. I can't. Please, tell her that I think of her every day, without fail. Tell her. [Casandra] The Lovers. It's mutual, captain. She wants to tell you that... she still loves you too. - Thank you. - My pleasure. [door opens] Clara. [knock on door] [door opens] Fernando? I saw Clara come out of your office. - Is everything all right? - Yes. A minor matter, nothing more. - What is it? - Clara has resigned. What? Why? Personal reasons. That was all she said. Don't worry. Let me talk to her. Anyway, we have a wonderful band to entertain the passengers. You're here for a reason, I guess? Yes. Well, I've been thinking, and had something to discuss. Naturally. Sit down, please. Whiskey? No, thank you. Fernando, as children, you were always the one with big ideas. Disorganized, but had big ideas. I was more organized, but less brilliant. We can agree on that. I've always thought one should put energy into the things one is good at. Poor management has put the shipping company in a bad financial position. It's not your fault, brother. It's just not your strength. But I'm happy dealing with figures. They're what I know. It's a big responsibility. I'm not sure you're ready. - Things have been complicated recently. - I know. And that's why it's best for everyone that I manage the company. Fernando, you're carrying too many responsibilities. What's your point, Natalia? Give me access to the accounts so that you can breathe more easily. I own this ship too. I'm not asking for anything untoward. All right. Perhaps you're right. I'll think about it. This ship is your greatest work. Allow me to keep it afloat. [Natalia] That's it. Our accounts are settled. All settled. Don't hold this against me. I've burned all my bridges in Spain and couldn't go back even if I wanted to. This money means I can disappear in Brazil. Buy a small house in the interior away from the world. Don't tell me your story, Varela. It's not interesting. In any case, we have another matter to attend to. Clara wants to stop singing. She just told Fernando. She's falling apart. I know. And that's just the first step. She's going to confess. Look, madam, I can hold my tongue as long as no one else knows. But if she talks... She won't talk. I assure you. [Varela chuckles] And how can you assure me of that? Because I'm going to take care of it myself. [Eva] I've just been with Uncle. I'll go and see him later. - How is he? - He's well. I spoke to Dr. Rojas too. Why would you talk to him? I asked him for information on... people who suffer from hallucinations. Right when I've seen a dead woman in my cabin and no one believes me? Carol, people fall ill and lose all sense of reality. So not only do you not believe me, you also think I'm a lunatic? [scoffs] You saw a dead woman in your cabin last night. That's not normal. Of course it's not. But that doesn't mean I'm losing my mind. What I'm trying to... What are you saying? Because instead of believing that it is real, you'd rather believe your sister is mad. - I'm just trying to help. - No. You're just trying to impose your absolute reality on me. The writer who knows everything. Look, I'm not asking you to believe me, it's too late for that. But I would ask one thing of you. Let me live my life. - Leave it out. - This one? Yes. I'll wear it this afternoon for the big occasion. I thought you would have spoken to her by now. No. In the end, we agreed to meet this afternoon, calmly. No rush. One has to do things by the book. Yes... - Sir. - Yes? May I speak with you? I was taking a bath. Just a second. It's important. - Dit moi, Dimas. - It's about our contract. I know people are normally paid an advance when the contract is signed. As that hasn't happened... - Is that what normally happens? - Yes. I wondered what your plans were, sir. I have great plans. We're going to make a fortune, Dimas, a fortune. - You need to be patient. - Yes, right, yes. But it might take a few years for that to happen and... Well, what would you like us to do? If we were in Spain, we could go to a bank, but the only bank here is fish. Right. I don't know, I thought, sir, you might find a solution. Speak to someone you trust. I don't know. I trust you, sir. Trust me. [door opens, then closes] I suppose you're going to say yes? Or you wouldn't have worn that. Well... I was saving it for a special occasion. It's what you wanted, right? A different life. - Just like you. - Yes. I persuaded Mr. Sebastián to give me an advance. So, I suppose everything is going well? Everything is fine. Verónica. Yes? I feel awkward saying this, but I want to. What? I want you to know that you're very dear to me. And that I... You what? I wish you all the best. Truly. Thanks, Dimas. Is something wrong? Clara wants to stop singing. She says she can't do it anymore. She hasn't mentioned it. - I'll talk to her. - No. We'll do it together. Pierre, we must keep this in check. And what do you suggest we do? Clara, look at me. You're very young. And very pretty. And you're highly talented, Clara. There's no reason to give up such a promising future. You've always wanted to sing. It's your dream. Clara, you can't allow what happened to ruin everything. It's a little late for that. No, everything's still possible. Do you remember the contact for singing in one of Rio's biggest venues? The one Aníbal told you about? He's my friend too, Clara. And he can give you the opportunities you deserve. Don't talk to me about Brazil, you hear me? Clara, please. Listen to her. Ms. Natalia just wants to help. [scoffs] [Clara] Have you forgotten? He used the Brazil thing to seduce me too. When he didn't get what he wanted, he raped me. All I want is to go back to Spain, as soon as possible. I don't ever want to sing again. Never! - Darling, please, don't get upset. - Let me go. - Clara, please. - Don't touch me! [door closes] - It's my fault. - No. - Don't say that. - No. It's true. I knew exactly what Aníbal was like. What he was capable of. And still, I did nothing to stop him. There's nothing anyone could do. That man was unstoppable. [Sebastián] Here. It has to be here. Well, I would have preferred somewhere more romantic, but I can't wait any longer. - Sebastián. - Verónica. What are you doing? Well, I'm about to say words that I never thought I would say. What words are those? Magic words? That rather depends on your answer. So... Now I'm a magician's assistant. Well, in a way. So what's the trick? No, there's no trick. It's... It's proper magic. See now, it's something like this... Verónica... will you marry me? So they really are magic words. Yes? Can't you tell? Yes, I can, but will you? Yes. Of course I will. [Sebastián] Yes. You owe me a beer. Of course. Thought you wouldn't come. [Eva laughs] - I needed that. - So I see. Bad day? Yes. It really wasn't the best. Is it because of the séance yesterday? You heard? The walls have ears. I don't like to interfere, but they said a woman's spirit appeared. No, no, of course there was no woman's spirit. What happened is that a fraudster pretended to be the woman's spirit. You didn't believe it? No. I hope you're not one of those who believe that sort of thing. No, I'm not one of those people. Don't worry. It's just that... they say it was Rosa Marín's spirit. You knew Rosa Marín? She disappeared in Vigo at Easter around two years ago. They say she was seeing a man who was engaged to be married, a wealthy man. Then suddenly no one heard from her again and she vanished. The police tried to find her, but something happened to that girl. [knock on door] Can I help you? Yes. Yes, may I come in? Well? You used to be a policeman, right? What I mean is, before working on this ship. Yes. I served in the Vigo police force for over 20 years. Why? Have you heard of Rosa Marín? Yes, of course. I was in charge of her case. So what happened? That girl disappeared without a trace. We looked for her everywhere, but... Was she seeing a man who was engaged to be married? People like to gossip and make up theories. But we could never prove anything. Why do you ask? No reason. Thank you. Even your sister-in-law has started asking questions about Rosa. I didn't think I'd hear that name again. I moved heaven and earth when you asked me to find her. If that witch is right, maybe she wasn't too far away. That woman is a fraud. What she says makes no sense. Right. But it's best not to stir it all up again. In case others are less trusting than me. I don't know what you're suggesting, but I never harmed her. I believe you. But it would have made a good alibi. Ordering that girl's search. Who would have doubted you? [knock on door] - Hello. - Hello. Can we speak? Certainly. I was expecting you. Are you well? Well, it's just that I was with my sister... and she says she wants to help, and I know she means it but... I don't know. She behaves as though I'm mad. I understand. Carolina, you are really sensitive. Not everyone has that gift. That's why they don't really understand us. But I'm still the same person. No one will hurt you. Trust me. You're not alone. Carolina, we need to finish what we started. What do you mean? We've opened a door. We have to close it. Rosa. If you're here, give us a sign. [sighs] We need you to say goodbye, and for you to go back where you belong. [sighs] Is this really necessary? Yes. I already told you. It's dangerous if we don't close the séance. How is it dangerous? Because someone who doesn't belong among the living but who stays trapped here is someone that has unfinished business. Unfinished business? They killed the woman, of course she's not at peace. That's not the worst. What? What's worse? She's very angry. I can feel her rage. And she could really hurt us. [electricity crackling] Hey! Wait! Wait! [knock on door] I must speak with my sister. Of course. Come in. - I'll leave you alone. - No, I want to speak to you both. What's wrong, Eva? She was a real person. Rosa Marín. She's a girl that disappeared. - [Carolina] So you believe Casandra? - There's something else. You're not mad, sis. You're not mad because I saw her too. What? You have to help us. This could be very dangerous. Why? Believe me when I say that the person who killed Rosa is on this ship.
