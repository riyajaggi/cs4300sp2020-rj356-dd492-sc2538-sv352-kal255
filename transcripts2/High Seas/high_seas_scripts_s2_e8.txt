 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [theme song playing] HIGH SEAS [phone rings] Bridge. Perfect, thank you. Have a sailor accompany them. The pilot and Lieutenant Cardoso have arrived to assist us with the maneuver. About to reach port. None too soon. I agree, Captain.

 Tell Nicolás to go and meet them. Yes, Captain. And have them release Mr. Fábregas. There's no longer a reason to hold him. Very good, Captain. Good day. The captain has asked me to release you from detention. Why aren't we moving? Why haven't we docked in port? I'm afraid there's a problem. Come in, please. Lieutenant Cardoso, from the Rio Port Authority. - Lieutenant, Mr. Fernando, the ship owner. - Mr. Fernando. You're with the police. Is something wrong? I know you picked up shipwreck survivors. That's right. And they weren't carrying papers. Before they can enter our country, we need to know their identity.

 Their version of the events. Of course. Of course, no problem. [Cardoso] There's something else. We've been told there is a case of gold on the ship. Our countries have agreed that my government will hold it while its origin is under investigation. [Nicolás] There's something you should know. The gold has been stolen. What do you mean? I don't understand. It belongs to Carlos Villanueva. Where is he now? [coughing] [sighs] You asked me about who killed Rosa Marín. There's no need to talk. I didn't kill Rosa Marín. You must believe me. She was only a threat to your marriage. I don't know who killed Rosa Marín. But it wasn't for the gold. Sofía... Where is she? We don't know if she survived. It's all my fault. Everything. You must get rid of that gold. It will only bring you misfortune. CHAPTER 16: LOVE CAN KILL Father! No, father! Father? Father! I'm sorry. [Nicolás] Eva! My father. I'm sorry. I have to get off this ship. We'll disembark soon, my love, but we can't do it yet. What do you mean? What's the matter? [Nicolás] Carolina. This is Lieutenant Cardoso, from the Brazilian police. He won't allow us to disembark until we find the gold and identify the survivors. I'm sorry, but for now you must remain at anchor. You own this ship, there must be something you can do! Carolina, let's calm down. - The best we can do is to help. - I just want this nightmare to end. I've had enough of being on this ship. I've had enough of people telling me to calm down. Let's begin the search. The sooner we get it done, the sooner you can disembark. I'll be back as soon as I can. I can look you in the eyes and tell you that my father didn't kill your sister. I feel much better knowing that it wasn't him. [Erich] But someone must have done it. [Eva] Yes. Yes, but I don't know. I don't know who could've done it. - Erich, is something wrong? - No. Nothing. Actually, a Brazilian police officer has boarded the ship, asking for information about you. If you tell them what happened, we'll be arrested. Speak to Fernando. Perhaps he can help you. No, I don't think Fernando will help us after what happened. It won't be easy, but you could try. No, I don't know that it's in my power to do what Casandra asks. I've invested so much time and effort to get this far, and if the police arrest us, it will... all have been in vain. Shortly after boarding, you accused me of having killed your sister. [Casandra] And I was mistaken. And I'm very sorry. But I hope you understand that I needed the truth, and that I still don't know who killed my sister. [Carolina] And how would that help? No one can bring back Rosa. But my sister's killer is on this ship. No, you don't know that. Her killer could be anywhere. Sometimes, the only way to survive is to look ahead, and leave the past behind. But I thought you wanted to help. And I have. But I think this has gone far enough. Bury your sister, Casandra, and live your life. It's best for everyone. [door opens, then shuts] [gasps] What are you doing here? What do you want? - [knock on door] - [Eva] Carol? Carol, open up, please. Carolina? [knocking continues] She's left, but she'll be back with a key soon. - Please, why are you doing this? - Get the trunk. [muffled screaming] - May I? - Yes, of course. What's wrong? Sebastián gave me back the patent. But we saw him lose at cards, how did he manage to convince Arturo? I think he gave him a property of his. I don't know how he could have done such a thing for me. Right. So that's it, isn't it? - Everything's resolved. - Yes. And what about us? Is everything resolved? [Sebastián] Dimas wasn't supposed to find out. In truth, nobody was supposed to find out. [Verónica] Well, I think what you did for him was very generous on your part. [Sebastián] I would rather have kept it quiet. I'm no hero. I'm doing this because I was a coward and didn't know how to face the situation. You've changed, haven't you? Well, let's say that the Sebastián de la Cuesta who left Vigo harbor is not the same one as now. [chuckles] Well, I like this one more. But not enough. Right? - Sebastián, I'd rather... - No need to say anything. I understand perfectly. Anyway... Anyway, what? Well, it's just... I'm pleased that you and Dimas are ending up together. What gives you the right to decide what I should do? No, my dear, I only meant that Dimas loves you. And I'm pleased, but it's up to me to decide what I do with my life. And? I think I'm better off alone. Be careful with that dress. They have to do this. They've checked my cabin too. This waste of time will push us to the brink. Unless we're ready in the next few hours, another ship will transport the coffee. Nothing. I'm sorry for the trouble. We're doing this as quickly as we can. If you explained, they'd understand. Thank you, Officer. I was sure my brother had the gold. No, sir, your brother didn't have it. It is regrettable to meet you under such circumstances. Mr. Pedro. As you know, the gold has disappeared. We're searching all the cabins. That's all very well, but I don't see how I can help. You, you... You can't imagine I have it, do you? It's obvious he doesn't have it. - Don't you see? - Eva. Sir, we can't exclude any possibility. Go ahead, go ahead, search, but you won't find anything. Excuse me. I'm so sorry, my child. I'm sorry. I know, Uncle. I know. Has Carolina been here? No, she hasn't, no. I'm so eager to get to dry land with you. As am I, my child. I can't find my sister anywhere. Well, perhaps she wants to be alone. No. No, it's very strange. I don't know where she might be. Give her a little time. Perhaps she's with Casandra. I'll go look for her. [popping sound] [Carolina] Help! What on earth have you done? [muffled] Help me, help me. [Erich] You don't need to be involved if you don't want to be. Erich, please. How can you be so sure it was her? It couldn't have been anyone else, Casandra, and deep down you know it's true. [muffled] Please, help me. Once we're allowed to disembark, we'll carry her out in the trunk. And when we're on land, out of the city, we'll find a safe place and get rid of her. I don't know. I don't know. What if we're wrong, Erich? Look at me. Who has stood at your side all these years? - You. - [Erich] A week ago we were on a boat in the middle of the ocean because we were sure that Rosa's killer was on this ship. I was at your side. I always have been. I would never let anyone hurt you. We were wrong about Fernando, but with her, I'm sure we're right about her. She knew what was going on between Fernando and Rosa. [knock on door] [Eva] Casandra? - It's her sister. - [Erich] If you speak, I will kill you. And your sister too. Eva. - What is it? - I'm looking for my sister. I thought she might be here, with you. No. No, she's not here. I saw her earlier, in, in the hall, but I haven't seen her recently. I see. I'll just keep looking. Apologies for the trouble. Everything will be solved in just a few minutes. I can't hold the passengers any longer, people are starting to get agitated. Yes, but there's nothing I can do. I follow orders. And they won't let anyone leave unless the gold has been found. Don't you see we've checked the cabins of everyone who might be involved? We've checked the cabins of everyone involved. The gold hasn't showed up. My sister hasn't either. - I'm beginning to worry. - Eva. There's something you might want to consider. What do you mean? I don't want to accuse your sister, but it would be easy to imagine that she was involved in Rosa's death. What are you saying? That's impossible. My sister is incapable of doing such a thing. Your sister was perfectly aware of Fernando and Rosa. I know she's your sister, but it would be the perfect reason for hiding away until we reach port. What is it? I know who has the gold. Thank you, Francisca. You may go and take care of your affairs. It's about time we reached land. Don't worry, we've arrived. Things can only get better. God willing. Shall I prepare some fruit for you? - No, thank you, I'm fine. - [knock on door] Miss. Are you all right? Yes, Francisca. I'll see you later. Please go and prepare the luggage. - Of course. - Thank you. Has Carolina showed up? No. No, not yet. She will. I remember how she always loved hiding when she was a girl. Yes. But she would always tell me her hiding place. I wish you hadn't caught it. Since when could you see? A few days. Long enough to visit the captain's cabin. Ask him to keep something so that you could see the combination. Something like that? Something like that. Goodbye to an easy last few years. Goodbye to the odd worthy cause. Well, love, I hope you understand. I no longer have the inclination or patience to understand anything. Eva, let's go. Niece... I'm sorry. You can take the ship to shore now. - But, where was it? - What does that matter? Miss, we need to know who had it. You needed to recover the gold and arrest Carlos Villanueva. Carlos is dead. And you have the gold here. Can we enter the harbor? Very well. Give the order for berthing. [fog horn blowing] Welcome to Rio de Janeiro. You may release the cables. Thank you. Release the cables. Lower the gangway. It's time to hit dry land. At last. Yes, Captain. Release the cables. [car horn honks] You were right. It really was that easy. You'll get used to it. I always come out on top. Start the engine. [mumbles] Don't pull that face, man. At this point, is there really anything that surprises you? You had it. I must be losing my faculties. I don't know why I didn't see it. You and I have a lot in common, apart from our nervous systems. Yours, I'm afraid, tends to let you down. You were planning to keep the gold without telling me, right? Says the person who was planning to flee with my brother. Please! Well, Rojas, our paths will diverge once and for all. In all honesty, I'm going to miss your bouts of hysteria. [door opens] [Varela] Doctor, please come with me. It's time to disembark. Helping Carlos was my way of staying out of prison, but everything I did before then, I did for us both. I know. But without telling me. I wouldn't have agreed to it. I never wanted to hurt your nieces. I know that too. [door shuts] Onward. Onward. [chuckles] We have to go. What are you doing? Carolina. - Water. - Simón, water. - Help me! - Stop! No, help me, help me, please. Did you see what she did? Don't try that again. Bring that, Simón. Erich, please, listen to me, maybe she's worth more to us alive than dead. We can ask for a ransom. You're mistaken if you think this was all about money. - We want justice! - Carolina. Casandra, please. Please, help me. Tell my sister. [sobbing] I've been looking for Carolina, and I can't find her. What do you mean, can't find her? She must be somewhere. What's the matter? It's possible that Carolina may have had something to do with Rosa Marín's death. No, no. That is absurd. What if she did something silly? Go to the foyer. I'll go to her cabin and see if she's there. Carolina? Carolina? I don't see her. She has to come this way in order to leave the ship. [Nicolás] Perhaps Fernando has found her. She's not in her cabin. I've found this. It's hers. An earring like this doesn't come off easily. What if they've taken her? I'll call the police. - Okay. - One second. Why are they carrying that trunk? We put Sofía in a trunk like that one. Hey, stop! [indistinct talking] Stop! And the trunk? Where were you going? Don't come any closer. Put the gun down. [Fernando] Arrest them! - [Eva] Carolina. - [Fernando] My love. [Eva] Carol, wake up. It's fine. Fine, don't worry. [crowd screams] What are you doing? Are you mad? Carolina. Did you kill my sister? Casandra, you're making a mistake. My sister is incapable of doing such a thing, you know it is true. Put the gun down! - Carolina. - Eva. Tell me the truth. If you really think I killed your sister, shoot. Shoot. [Nicolás] Arrest her! Carolina, I'm sorry. - Carolina. - She could have killed you. Please fold that properly. What's the difference when we'll iron it later? [grunts] I didn't think she'd want to hurt me. Why are you still defending her? That woman is mad. She's obsessed with the death of her sister. Ultimately, I feel sorry for her. Is that any reason to excuse her? Fernando's right. She can't take the law into her own hands. She'll go to prison and won't know who killed her sister. [Francisca] Ladies. - The luggage is ready. - [Eva] Thank you, Francisca. - [knock on door] - It's open. The passengers have disembarked. You are the last ones left. [Fernando] Let's go. Anxious? Well, I spent three years believing she was dead. I can't imagine it's easy for her either. We're both adults. She'll understand what happened. And you? Do you have an editor waiting for you? Yes. The only good thing about all this is that it's helped me write a novel. Is that all? No. That's not all. Good luck, Nicolás. Thanks. And don't you stray too far away. - I'll go see if the car has been unloaded. - We won't be long. Francisca, you need to return the key and... sign here. Shall we go? Yes. Let's go. [Casandra] Someone forged this letter but got her signature wrong. She always signed as María Rosa, because of our grandmother. Here she signed as Rosa Marín. She didn't leave this boat alive. [Eva] Carol? [Varela] One moment, please. Go and check if the police car has arrived. Varela, one moment. Carolina, I'm really sorry. I... I don't know what to say. There isn't much to say. It shouldn't have ended like this. It should never have started. Maybe we'll meet in another life. And things might be different. I hope not. I did it for my sister. You would've done anything for yours. Varela. Carolina. I wish you happiness. With Fernando, or without him. Miss, please. [Francisca] I don't know how you can speak to her, miss. She should rot in hell. Miss, best listen to my mother, unless you want to have to deal with her. She made poor Sebastián's life hell on this trip. All three of you are daughters to me. I'd do anything to protect you. [Carolina] You would do anything wouldn't you? Of course I would, miss. Francisca... that letter was never posted under the door. You wrote it. You wrote the letter from Rosa Marín. It's the same way of signing. Francisca? No. No, that's not possible. You knew about Fernando and Rosa. [Verónica] Mother? I just wanted to... [sobs] I just wanted to help. I told her to leave him. I just wanted to help. But she wouldn't listen to me. [Francisca] I won't let you hurt Carolina. You'll write a letter to Fernando right now, saying you'll leave him - and will stay out of his life forever. - Who do you think you are? I'm going to speak to Fernando right away and tell him what has happened. - Don't do that, please! - Let go! - I won't allow it. - Let go! - I won't let you do it! - Get out of my way. You're insane, madam. I don't want to hurt you, but you have to leave him. He's going to marry Miss Carolina. You can't stand between them, because I won't allow you to. How could you keep this to yourself all this time? I did it for you, miss. I couldn't let you suffer anymore. I'll pay. I'll pay for what I did, but I'm not sorry. What's happening? [popping sound] What is it? - [Verónica] Mother! - But, Francisca! It was her. Miss. Miss! Francisca? Francisca, please! Where did she go? I don't know. [Nicolás] Francisca! [Francisca panting] Francisca! Mother! Come any closer and I'll jump! Calm down. No one will come any closer. I did it all for you, miss. To protect you. Just as I've always done for the three of you. I didn't mean to kill her. Nicolás, help her! She's lost her mind. Come closer and I'll jump! - Mother, please! - Francisca, please! Verónica is here. You can't do this to her. You can't do this to us. I promise it will all work out. [Francisca] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - [Eva] No! - Francisca! [siren wailing] Will she be all right? I hope so, Verónica. Get into the ambulance. We'll go to the hospital and see you there. I'm sorry. I'd have waited all the time it took. Thank you for everything. There's no need to thank me. Let's go. [Fernando] Wait for me in the car, I'll be right there. [Chantal] Nicolás. Let's go, Eva. We were in this very car just two weeks ago about to take the ship. If anyone had told us about the voyage, we wouldn't have believed them. No one is ready for everything that happened to us. But it has to serve some purpose. For you, yes. You have a plot for your novel. And you? You must have gotten something out of this voyage. Good or bad. I think I've become a little more mistrustful. Before, I got too caught up in things. But... from now on, I'm going to make my own decisions. For better or worse. That's good then. Yes. I suppose it is. And do you trust me? No. Always. [door opens] Shall we go? - Of course. - Let's go. [Eva] The first voyage on the Bárbara de Braganza had come to an end. So many unforeseen things had happened. And then there were all those that would still happen, because although we didn't know it, it was our first voyage but not our last. Another destination awaited. And, who knows? Perhaps... another mystery, too. [suspense song]
