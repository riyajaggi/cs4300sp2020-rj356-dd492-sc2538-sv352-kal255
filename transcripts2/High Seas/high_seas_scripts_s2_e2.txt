 [panting] [sobbing] Carolina. Carolina, darling, wake up. My love, it's me. Carol, Carol, it's all right, it's all right. Darling, it's all right. Darling. You're having a nightmare. It's all right. It's me, my darling. Try to sleep, it's still night.

 It's all right, it's all right. It's all right. Good morning, darling. Good morning. I must have kept you awake all night. I slept right through. Are you feeling better? I can't stop thinking of that woman. And what if she's right? What if there is another murderer on the ship? Yes, a murderer and a ghost. Fernando, you own this ship. Take this seriously. There is no evidence, not a shred, that what this woman says is true. Darling, the last few days have been very difficult.

 Why don't we try to put everything behind us and enjoy our honeymoon? Look what I brought. What a feast. Well, my wife deserves the best. - You're leaving? - Yes, I must persuade the captain that we should pick up speed. We have many commitments and there's no time to waste. I'll see you later. [gasps] FROM THE DEAD [Simón] No one believed her. No one trusted her. Just us. And that's why we survived. But how could she know there would be an explosion? Because she has powers. No one has powers, madam. What you're saying is absurd. Casandra does. She sees things before they happen. Everyone would have died if it weren't for her. I'm eager to meet this Casandra. Everyone is talking about her. Of course. If you start talking about ghosts, then people are bound to talk about you. I got a chill when she spoke about a murdered woman. Don't tell me you believed her. No, of course not. Didn't you want to meet her? Well, there she is. She looks perfectly normal. Well, she's not, I'm telling you. I just hope she stops going around talking nonsense. Things have been difficult enough. [Natalia] And Fernando? I thought he was going to join us? Carolina. I'm talking to you. What about Fernando? Fernando... Fernando went to see the captain, they had a meeting. He asked me to send his apologies. [Eva] I'm going to see how Uncle is doing. Are you coming? No. Good morning. Bon appetit. Good morning. You go. I still need to arrange my things in the cabin. The wonderful life of a newlywed. For those who think it is. Would you forgive me if I left you alone? Of course, my dear. I'm used to it. No, thank you. Mrs. Beatriz. Are you all right? Oh, Carolina. What, what is it? - What happened? - Oh, it's nothing, I'm just feeling a little agitated because I've been told things about my life that few people know. I see. What sort of things? If you can share. Things about my life, some trivial things that I had even forgotten. She saw them in her cards and left me feeling rather unsettled. Yes, of course. It's as though my life story was in those pictures for her to read. You must think I'm mad to believe such nonsense. No, not at all. We must be in Rio in nine days. That is two days ahead of schedule. We are considerably delayed, captain, we must make up that time. Or this company will flounder. It's risky. The boilers may not tolerate such high heat over a long period of time. Captain, this isn't a whim. All of our good fortunes depend on this. Full steam ahead. [cranking] Thank you, captain. I appreciate your cooperation. Nicolás. Go down to the engine room every two hours and let me know how they are coping. [grunts] And this girl, Sofía. Let her go. We don't have enough reason to keep her locked up. Hey, what's the matter? From my wife. She's in Brazil. Alive. Waiting for me. This certainly is unexpected news. Are you pleased? Of course, I'm happy she's alive. I wish a message of this nature would reach me, so that I could see my wife again, just for a second. You look concerned. It's Eva. Don't know what to do. Be honest. That's always best. Come on, let's go. When did it arrive? Last night. I swear I didn't know she was alive. You must believe me. I believe you. Last I heard, she was in a prison camp. I looked for her. I looked for months. I was sure she had died. Eva. What happened between us is real. I don't want to lose you. Have you replied? Not yet. For the first time in my life, I'm... I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do. The first thing is to reply. And then? Do you still love her? She's my wife. It's as you say. She's your wife, Nicolás. What happened between us was just a few days, nothing of consequence. Eva, don't say that. It's about more than just a few days. She's alive. That's good news. And stop overthinking things. Eva! [door closes] Six, seven, turn. [dance music playing] Step, six, seven, elbow. Elbow, three. That's it. One, two, three. Would you like to join the class? Keep going, six, seven. - Would you like to dance? - Two, three. Six, seven. Two, three, that's it. Six, seven. Everyone on this ship has heard of you and what you can do. [Casandra] Yes, yes, I noticed. - [Erich] Are you all right? - Yes, yes, I'm well. Carolina! You may leave now, Erich, thank you. - How are you? - Fine, fine. I was going to the canteen to meet with the other survivors. Would you like to join me? Yes. - Are you well? - Yes. Just a little tired. Are you sure? Is that all? I'm afraid. [Carolina] When you said there was a spirit on this ship... Well, I... in truth, I didn't believe you. But you see, this morning something very unusual happened. Something very unusual that can't be explained. I haven't even told my sister. What happened? Carolina. You can trust me. Truly. Very well. So... - I was in the bathroom of my cabin... - Mm-hm. and when I came out, suddenly I saw all my clothes on the floor. The wardrobes were all open, and wardrobes don't just open on their own, you know. Have you told anyone else? No, no... I don't want anyone to worry. Not Fernando, or Eva. Carolina... you're a very giving person. You try to protect everyone you care for. But who takes care of you? I don't need anyone to worry about me. We all need someone. You've been close to death. What? Is that right? I was poisoned. How did you know? When a person goes through a near-death experience, they somehow establish a connection to the afterlife. - The afterlife? - Mm-hm. You mean that woman...? Not everyone passes in peace. And... their spirit remains in our midst. What does she want? I don't know. But I'm certain she will let us know soon. Well, I'm... I need some fresh air. Casandra. Someone died here. Last night they said that three people had died in the last few days. Yes. One of them died here. Aníbal. [Varela] Good morning. Do you have a moment? I'm sure you do. Particularly for me. You're being rather tiresome, Varela. What do you want now? It's not what I want, madam. It's what we both want. I'm in no mood for riddles. You don't want me to speak to the captain about those blood stains I saw in your cabin, and about what you and that singer did on the night your husband died. Very well. That's what I want. But what are you after? Let's say, remuneration in exchange for keeping my mouth shut. You're blackmailing me. No. Blackmail is such an ugly word. - And what would you call it? - Business. - Everything in life is business. - [scoffs] We're approaching land, time is running out. And I'm sure you don't want anyone to find out that you killed your husband. Look, Varela... I am dangerous when threatened. I'm showing extreme caution in this matter and I think you should show [whispers] a little more gratitude. I will pay you, rest assured. But I don't yet hold my husband's shares. So you won't get your money until we reach land and the will is formalized. [in normal voice] You're going to force me to do something I would rather not do. Excuse me? Mrs. Fábregas. Have a nice day. So? We have a problem. It's Clara. What is the matter? It's all over. - What? - [Pierre] Darling, please, stop talking like that. You're worrying me. What are you saying, Clara? What else has she said? Nothing, nonsense. - She's been drinking. - What else has she said? Don't worry. In the end, everyone will know. We killed Aníbal. It's best to face up to... In the shower, now. Enough of this nonsense. Go! [knock on door] Yes? "Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise." Victor Hugo. I was told that you called for me. Yes. I've been looking everywhere for you. I wanted to see you. That's hardly strange, is it? I missed you. No. Verónica. I was afraid yesterday. I'd never have forgiven myself if something had happened to you. Verónica, I've never felt like this about anyone. Yes, I'm sure you believe I must have said that a thousand times. And it's true, perhaps I have, but I never meant it. Not before now. What are you talking about? I think I'm starting to... understand what it is to be in love. At last. Ah. I'm not sure I can decipher that look. No, well, it's my usual look. But, are you pleased? Or, do you not share my feelings? Let's discuss this another time. Yes? I've left a chore half done and I need to go. Verónica. Aren't you staying for breakfast? No, well, I have something to do for my mother, you know how she is. - Listen, Dimas. - Yes? I wanted to thank you for what you did. But I didn't, I did nothing. It was Miss Eva who confronted her father, and I barely dared to go in. No, that's not true. - You were very brave and saved my life. - No, no, I insist, it was Miss Eva. When I saw that man holding a knife at your throat, I almost fainted. If anything were to happen to you, Verónica, I don't... I don't know what I'd do. Well, I am indebted to you. If there's anything I can do for you... I think if we could dine together one night, it'd be more than enough. You don't need much, do you? It is more than enough. I'm sorry, really. I don't know what happened. Never mind. Make sure it never happens again, Clara. It's enough that I must deal with Varela without you causing problems. What's with Varela? Natalia? He wants me to pay him for his silence. Don't worry. I will pay him. Varela is my problem, agreed? By the way, Clara, you do know what time it is? Yes, my show begins in an hour. Exactly. So, in one hour, I want to see you on that stage exuding joy and light. Draw it out however you can. And this is never to happen again. Do you understand? Clara, you can't go on like this. Try to forget what happened. Varela's not going to hurt us. And you did nothing wrong, you were just protecting yourself from Aníbal. Have you forgotten? Despite everything, you are still the same person inside. And no one can take that from you. You're here. I was looking for you. Eva... - What's wrong? - Nothing. What do you mean? Have you been crying? No. It's Nicolás. I thought I had finally found someone, but I was wrong. So, there it is. I'm fine. No, Eva, you're not fine. Must you always wear a shield? Tell me. What did you want? Nothing. Not nothing when you've come here to speak to me. All right then. I talked to Casandra. Forget about her. She seeks attention by talking nonsense. I saw Mrs. Beatriz too, and Casandra read her cards. She reads cards too? What a multi-talented woman! You should have seen her. She said things that no one else could have known. People believe what they want. There's more. We walked down the corridor and when we passed the stairs, she said that she felt very strange. As though... as though someone had died. It was by the stairs where they found Aníbal. Enough. Eva, where are you going? Eva! - Tell me where you're going! - To talk to Fernando. - Why? - Because if everyone starts to believe her - this ship will turn into an asylum. - Wait a minute. Either you talk to him or I will. But do it before everyone starts seeing ghosts. Sorry but I don't really understand your concern. Miss Lenormand, I wouldn't ask if circumstances were different. But since we set sail from Vigo a number of things have occurred... There's no need to explain. I sensed it as soon as I came onboard. So you understand that the passengers have been under extraordinary pressure. Going around talking about ghosts does not help the situation. And you must try to understand that there are spirits among us. The blessed dead woman once again! Eva! I don't understand why we have to keep talking about this. Look, I respect your beliefs... They're not beliefs, it's fact. If that woman's spirit is on this ship that's because her body is here, too. - Her body? - [Casandra] Mm-hm. And if this woman's body is on the ship, I suppose you will know where to find it. No. No, I don't. So, is your sixth sense failing you? I can help you look for her. That woman needs a burial so that she can rest in peace. No one here is going to look for anything, miss. Why not? Are you afraid of what we might find? No, no. Of course not. - So, why are you denying the truth? - The only truth is that you're making things up in order to swindle money out of people. I ask no one for money. Look, I realize that certain things are difficult to understand. But, well, I am indebted to you for saving my life. So don't worry, I will try to be more discreet. Thank you for understanding. [high-pitched static ringing over PA] By the time you realize what is happening, it may be too late. Have a good day. [murmuring] I assure you that noise didn't come from us. We may sometimes play out of tune, but not to that extent. Boys, we've entered the southern seas. So let's celebrate properly. Rhythm and joy. Everyone to the dance floor! [band playing] ♪ Oh, if I could live ♪ ♪ Like an English lord ♪ ♪ And visit Turkey ♪ ♪ I can't because ♪ She seems better. Keep an eye on her. Clara is fragile and may crack at any moment. I would worry about Varela. I told you, he's my problem. You take care of Clara. [continues singing] We're in international waters. I don't have jurisdiction. This ship sails under the Spanish flag, I'm sure you can do something. Don't be a pest, Varela. I'm on holiday. And I was on holiday when you needed evidence to prosecute that poor man. All right. And then we're even. Carolina had a nightmare last night. I'm worried because she was still afraid when she awoke. It's because of everything that woman has been saying. I don't know what it is, but I need your help. I don't know how to act with her. I suppose it requires a little patience. It's been difficult with everything that happened with my father. I just want things to settle down. To get to Brazil, be with Carolina... and have children. - Is it too much to ask? - You will have all of that, you'll see. Let me help you. How? By showing, once and for all, that Casandra is a fraud. Go to the machine room. How are you? Well, in a daze. Trying to get used to the idea. Thank you for understanding, Eva. None of this is your fault. It's the way things are. It'd be unreasonable to be angry with you. It helps that you are here. I couldn't bear not speaking to you. Do you recognize this symbol? I've seen it somewhere, but don't remember where. Follow me. - [Nicolás] Here. - [Eva] Here? [Nicolás] This ship has a long history. Before it was the Bárbara de Braganza, it was the Covadonga. Look. This was its emblem. When Fernando bought the ship, they stripped it, except for the bridge. Where did you get it? From Casandra's cabin. You went in? Eva? You shouldn't go into people's cabins without permission. I did it for my sister. She's afraid, and all because of what that woman is saying. I wanted to prove that she's not psychic, just a liar. And I'm even more certain now. How could she have gotten hold of this? I don't know. Neither do I, but I plan to find out. I will help you in any way I can, Eva. You know that, don't you? Nicolás, no. Let's not start something that will end badly. I'm sorry. I want it, too. But we'll only hurt each other. - [Dimas] Sir! - Enter, Dimas. - I have your freshly ironed shirts. - Yes. Go on, leave them here. It's perfect timing. I am about to make one of the most important decisions of my life. - What about? - You know, Dimas, after yesterday. When one is about to lose one's life, one realizes how much time is lost on insignificant things. Yes, of course. And that, sometimes, one doesn't value things that matter. Yes, it's good that you realize all this and can draw a lesson from it. That's right. A lesson. You're a wise man, boy. The lesson I've learned is that it's time to start making some important decisions. And so I need your help. Follow me. [Dimas] This one is more delicate, sir. And this one is more ostentatious. I suppose it must be more expensive. Dimas, please, money is not an issue. Sir, it's a very personal decision. I can't say much. Dimas, please. I've always relied on your judgment, - haven't I? - Yes. Well, don't let me down now. Which one would you give to the woman you love? The other one, sir. Say no more. I prefer this one. Congratulations. Will you be paying in pesetas or cruzeiros? Pesetas. But please charge it to my account. As you wish. I shall fetch a mother-of-pearl box for you. Thank you, Dimas. Verónica will love it. I'm sure she will. Pay first. Doing business? Don't tell anyone, eh? No. Don't worry, I haven't seen you. There's a party downstairs. No band, but there's a guy who plays the guitar beautifully. Sounds good, but... "But" is the worst word in the dictionary. I'm grateful. Really, some other time. Not much left. I'm sure to run into you at some point. I hope. I think it'd do you good. What? To have some fun. Indian silk is infinitely better than Chinese silk. Please, there's no comparison. - Would you excuse me? - Naturally. Don't approach me in public again. You're like a prowling dog. You're in no position to give me orders, first of all. And second of all, I'm not "prowling," I'm sorting out your affairs. Follow me. Can you tell me where we're going? Be patient, you'll see in a moment. This is your cabin? Come in, please. What is this? All it needs is your signature and you'll be the official heir to your husband's wealth. Mr. Saldaña is a judge and as this ship is registered in Spain, he has legal authority to approve the will. And I prefer to get out of this cubby hole as soon as possible. I think you should sign, even if it's just to see the back of me. What's so funny? In the end, I'm the one who's saving your neck. If you're expecting thanks, I wouldn't hold your breath. I hope you'll pay what you owe. [Pedro] In order to keep hold of your arm, I must try to forget what you did to Carolina. I wouldn't have allowed anything to happen to her. - I was desperate. - But you did do it. Mr. Pedro, how are you? I am well, captain, given the circumstances. You know, I am making quite a saving on lighting costs. Doctor, might I speak to you alone? We can speak here. I think I know what you'll say. Thank you for what you have done for Mr. Pedro and the sailor who was so brutally attacked. That's my job, captain. I would also like you to know that I understand your actions over the last few days were well intended. Captain. But the ends do not justify the means, Dr. Rojas. I know. And that is why I would like you to understand that I will have to report what happened. I understand perfectly, captain. I am prepared to take full responsibility for my actions. Very good. That is all. - Enjoy your evening. - Thank you. The captain is right, Rojas. Yes. I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror. You do? Well, that makes two of us. [Pedro clears throat] [Casandra] The moon is face down. This tells us that he's hiding something and that you shouldn't trust him. And this? It's up to you to make the right decision, but listen to the mysteries and spiritual force of the cards. I had many doubts about this person. - Mm-hm. - I now know he's not to be trusted. - Many thanks. - My pleasure. You seem to have been a great help. Well, nature has blessed me with a gift and I believe I should use it to help others. - May I? - Of course. And what sort of help do they seek, if I might ask? You see, what you just witnessed was a professional case. The gentleman didn't trust his partner. But usually people come to me because they have lost someone. Yes, I can imagine. One can feel very alone, at times. Do you miss your wife? How did you know that? Well, I already told you that nature blessed me with a gift. Yes. I think of her every day. Perhaps you were unable to say goodbye as you wished. You have another chance. Thank you for the kind offer. I don't doubt your special ability, but... I know this isn't a discreet place. Captain, I would like to thank you for immediately trusting me. The ship owner seems to think I'm a problem for the other passengers. I'm captain of this ship. I decide who is and who isn't a problem. Thank you. I am sure we will have the opportunity to continue this conversation, captain. Enjoy your evening. You've become a celebrity in no time. That wasn't my intention, I assure you. Right. Well, forgive me if I don't believe you. You've been seeking notoriety since you got here. I'm harming no one. Yes, you are. My sister is afraid. But it's not because of what I have said. It's something else. Something else? What else? I see she hasn't told you. Well, I can understand why. You wouldn't have believed her anyway, would you? You've traveled on this ship before. It's the Covadonga. You do recognize it. Yes. A long time ago. Well. What a coincidence that you were rescued by this particular vessel. I don't believe in coincidences. If the ship I was on sank, then it was... so that I would be here. There is a reason for everything you say about ghosts and I'll find out what it is. Eva. You are a woman with strong convictions and I wouldn't try to persuade you of anything. What can I do to convince you? Nothing. Leave me alone, and leave my sister alone. Your mother wants you to write again. What did you say? You haven't written for a long time. Your mother says you're very talented. Don't ever speak of my mother again. Sofía! They released me. I knew you could fool them. I will get you out of here. Trust me. I have no doubt. We can't have this child grow up without his father. [screams]
