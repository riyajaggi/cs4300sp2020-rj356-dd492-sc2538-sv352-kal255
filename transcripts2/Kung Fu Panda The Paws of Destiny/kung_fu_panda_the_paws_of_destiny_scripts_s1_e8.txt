 [TITLE MUSIC] 1x08 - Secrets Lost to Shadow [SNORING] He's alive. Look at our paws, Master Po's alive! How do you know? Maybe it's that mouth-breathing turkey, Jindiao, messing with us? I thought Jindiao was a vulture. - I was insulting him, Fan Tong. - Oh! I don't get it. No, it was Master Po's chi. I could feel it. Jindiao couldn't fake that. You know what? We're gettin' out of here right now.

 Stand back, I'm gonna totally disrespect this door. Eaah! That was not supposed to happen. Jindiao must have warded the room with some kind of chi seal. Our new abilities are useless here. We have to find another way. Dude, what are you doing? I'm looking for air leaking out from cracks in the boards. Ugh, he's losing it. If Fan Tong doesn't make it, can I have his chi? Wait! If there's cracks, there might be a way out. Ugh, do you know how dirty my fur is gonna get rolling around... Whoa! Jing, come on, Master Po needs us. Master Po doesn't need me. - I've done enough to him already. - But that wasn't your fault.

 Yeah, and I thought we'd broken Jindiao's hold. We weakened it, but I can still feel him. Jindiao can take control of me anytime. You're in danger just being with me! I can't help you anymore. JADE TUSK: This is where the entrance to the Cave of The Four Constellations opened. I have waited a thousand years for this moment. [LAUGHS] [ROARS] The wellspring is within my grasp! [CLEARS THROAT] Thank you. Now, stand back. Master... [QUAKING] [GROANS] Ugh. Security wards. Let's try that again. [MUSIC] [GRUNTS] Oh, that felt good! Love that Dragon Master Chi. [DEEP BREATH] Are you coming? [BAO SCREAMS] WATER DEER GUARD: Knock it off in there! She's looking! Keep going. Aah! I'm in pain! My sinuses! - "My sinuses?" - What else am I supposed to say? I don't know. You're the performer. We need to convince the guard you need medical attention, not a tissue to blow your nose. Man, you've gotten bossy since you got your Hero Chi. Ooh! My knees! Cramping. Can't take the pain. Ugh! Keep it down, you little brat. I'm coming. FAN TONG: [SQUEALS] Here she comes! [FIGHTING GRUNTS] It's time to go. [MUSIC] [SNORING] [GASPS] [SNORING] [ALL PANTING] My thighs are sweaty! They're gonna hear my thighs! No one cares about your sweaty thighs! [GASPS] [GRUNTS] [ALL GRUNTING] Grandma? Wonderful, you recognize me. Help me up before the blood drains from my cankles. - Wait a minute, where's... - MR. PING: Help! Darkness! [STUTTERS] I can't feel my flippers! [WHIMPERS] That was so horrible. My, [GASPS] my life flashed before my eyes. It wasn't as good as I remembered. Shh! Not here. Let's talk inside. What are you guys doing here? I thought Jindiao put the whole village to sleep? The spell only affects pandas. The goose brain is much more evolved. Okay... What about you, Grandma? Please, dementia made my brain into mush years ago. No one's allowed to lock up my babies but me. Group hug! [MOANS] No way. Grandma, Mr. Ping, Master Po is alive. [GASPS] I knew it! Where is my beautiful boy? Oh, oh, I just can't wait to tell Cart! We don't know where he is, but we're gonna find him. First, though, we gotta get past Jindiao's guards. I think I can help with that. Chi takes time to rebuild. Of this, I am sure. Great! So, what did you have in mind? Ah, this is gonna help me get back my chi how exa... [GROANS] Do you question why the sun rises? If the sun was on top of a balance beam, balancing a pair of buckets, I would! [GROANS] - Oh, that stings! - Good, now move it. And don't spill a drop, I just cleaned the floors. Your floors are dirt. Okay, okay, okay! No spillage. So, how do you know how to do this? Just an observation, but you don't look like you get out much. Mm, "One need not walk a mile, if one is already home." The great Oogway taught me that. Yeah, that sounds like something Oogway would... [STUTTERS] What?! Oogway? You know Oog... [SCREAMS] [THUD] This is nuts! You know Oogway! I know Oogway! Ha! Small world, huh? BUNNIDHARMA: A little too small. [HEAVY BREATHING] [GRUNTS] Training is over. I am tired. Start again tomorrow. No, no, hold on. I need to know how - you know Master Oogway? - I don't know who that is. But you just said you did. Did I? Oh, yes, of course. Master Oogway. I haven't seen him since he chased Ke-Pa, the Demon King, out of the Valley of Peace. That was over a thousand years ago! How old are you, guy? [CHUCKLES] Oh! I haven't kept track. [MUSIC] Bunni... [SNAP] You know, I believe Oogway is the reason I am in this cave. I knew it! I knew it wasn't random you found me! You're connected to what's happening. Why did Oogway put you in this cave? I believe he put me here because... Because... Lunch! Who's hungry? Ugh! Why couldn't it be easy? Just once! Uh, Grandma, no offense, but how are history scrolls gonna help us? Keep it up, I enjoyed that. What are we doing here, Grandma? Getting you kids out of the town without being seen. This whole village is built over tunnels that extend down through the mountain. I never heard about those. That's because you kids never study! Ah, here we go. FAN TONG: Have you ever been in them? GRANDMA: Nope. Not even sure why they are there - or who built them. - That's not very reassuring. I think my thighs are sweating again. Guys, this is it. This is how we escape if we wanna find Master Po. All right! We're gonna need torches. - And food! - Cart and I can make you some nice travel plums basted in cricket flour. Maybe just the torches then. Jing, you okay? - I'm staying. - What? If Jindiao takes me over, he'll see what's happening. You'll never escape to help Master Po. We're the Four Constellations, not three. You're one of us. And you're my best friend, and I can't imagine doing this without you. And I don't wanna beg so don't make me! [GRUNTS] That said, Jing, if you want to stay behind you... Ow! We need to find a way to beat Jindiao at his own game. Come on, everybody, think. Sometimes when I get scared, I try to think of a happy place. When I get scared or sad, I just look in a mirror! [SIGHS] Always cheers me up. Hold on! That might be something. When Jindiao takes control of me, he sees what I see. What if I could make him see something else? - My version of a "happy place." - A memory. JADE TUSK: No sign of the Wellspring, Master. JINDIAO: And you're certain the children didn't discover it? From what I and my spies have observed, yes. This pool is where they kept the Wellspring. The most powerful source of energy in the universe, and that idiot Oogway chose to keep it in a cave beneath a village of useless pandas. Guarded by four fools. Perhaps, in the time that's passed, it simply dried up. [GRUNTS IN EFFORT] [JADE TUSK GRUNTS] The Wellspring is not of this world. It will flow long after we have left this existence. It is here, just hidden. Once I have the power of the Four Constellations and retrieved my true body, I will find the Wellspring and claim it as my own. And then... Master? And then, dear Jade Tusk, I will become a God! [LAUGHS] But, first things first, the children. - How we doin', Bao? - Good. Unless this map is upside down, in which case, no idea. That's reassuring. You guys think we're alone down here? Probably not. But don't worry, Fan Tong, if there is something down here, I'm sure you'll be the first one who gets eaten. What?! Why would you say that? Because he's Bao. I'm just being honest. No way we're all gonna make it. JING: Anyone think it's weird that there's a bunch of tunnels beneath our village we never knew about... Aah! [GASPING BREATH] It's him. Ugh! He's trying to take control! Fight him! Remember the plan, your version of a happy place. Our new abilities are useless here. We have to find another way. Right where I left them. [GASPS AND GRUNTS] He's gone. I think it worked! Yeah! Guys, maybe we're really going to escape... Ah! [SCREAMS] ALL: Fan Tong! This is silly. My memory is fine. Yeah, that's pretty much the first thing someone with a bad memory would say. Don't worry, this will be painless. Just gonna jog the ol' brain fibers a skosh by showing you some badly neglected, and mostly unwashed objects from your past. Aha! Perfect! Memories unleash! Nothin'? Okay, okay, no problem. - How about this? - Mm? - Uh, aha! Huh? - Hmm. Ooh! Ooh! Fuzzy boots! Which I might want to borrow later. You are not putting your stinky panda feet in my booties. Now, can we get back to your training? Unless, reviving your chi and helping your friends is no longer important to you. Wow, guy, that's cold, but inspiring! A true Dragon Master never gives up! Thank you. This [GRUNTS] right here! This looks, promising! Just hold on a second, I almost got it. [GRUNTS] Whoa! Anything? No! And look at the mess you've made. Get up, Po! Get up! Huh? BUNNIDHARMA: Master Po. Get up. You have all the power in your own mind. Get up! Wait, what did you just say? You heard what I said! It was you. Your voice! It was in my head! Who are you? [STUTTERS] I-I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just an old rabbit. Please, stop with all this. Forgive me, guy, but I can't. There's, like, lives at stake, including my own. You're making my head hurt. [GASPING] Leave me alone! No way, not this time! [PANTING] - FAN TONG: Help me! - NU HAI: We're trying! I think I'm gonna be sick! He pukes on me, I don't care what you say, that fool's getting a chi blast. [ALL GRUNTING] Uh, this seems bad. Right, guys? [FAN TONG CRYING] Fan Tong! [ZHIZHU GROWLS] [ALL GASP] - [STUTTERS] Bao? - Yep. Backing up now. [SCREAMS] [GASPS AND WHIMPERS] [ROARS] Oh, my word, look at this, you're pandas. Did I frighten you? I am so sorry. This is so embarrassing. I thought you were trespassers. If you were trespassers, I would have to eat you. But you're pandas! Hooray! You're supposed to be here. Uh, what's happening? Uh, uh, that's right. We're pandas. And we're supposed to be here. Yep. So, if we could just get our friend, we'll get going. Of course, of course. I just need to see your paperwork. Your passage scrolls telling me you have permission to be here? Oh yeah, [NERVOUS CHUCKLES] those. Passage scrolls? Crazy story, we, uh, see, we left the scrolls in our other panda pants. We do have a really cool map, though. Good? Right? [CHUCKLE] No, a map won't work. This is awkward, but rules are rules, I'm going to have to eat you. ALL: What? Mm, I know. And you guys seem great. But I am Zhizhu, guardian warrior of the sacred Arachnid clan! Weapon of the Four Constellations. It is my sworn oath to eat all intruders. Sorry. Who's first? [ROARS] [ALL GRUNTING] JING: [SCREAMS] Whoa! [GROWLING] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS AND GASPS] [SCREAMS] Whoa! [SCREAMS] ZHIZHU: Ow! I think you just broke one of my pedipalps. - You okay? - No. But lucky my back took most of the impact. [NERVOUS CHUCKLE] Money maker is still intact. You guys, he said he was a weapon of the Four Constellations. So? - We're the Four Constellations! - Oh, yeah. You're saying that spider works for us? Oh, he is so fired! Let's break out some chi and show him who's boss. [GROWLS] Hey, Zsa Zsa! Zhizhu. The "h" is silent. Whatever, time to meet your new master... No! Bao! Batter-up! [GROWLS] [FAN TONG SCREAMS] Oh, no! Hands off my friends! Please? [ALL GRUNTING] Oh, well, I don't believe my four eyes! You're the Constellations! I am just mortified by this turn of events. Zhizhu, guardian warrior of the sacred Arachnid clan, is your weapon to wield, masters. Yeah, we know, bubba. [CHUCKLES] FAN TONG: Sorry again about the whole sword thing. Oh, please, this is the most fun I have had in, [DEEP BREATH] well, a thousand years. I still don't understand how the pandas are connected to the Wellspring, when we only heard about it a couple of days ago. Mm, yes, that is strange. The pandas have always been the guardians of the Wellspring, the Four Constellations were simply its protectors. Did everyone just forget somehow? You've been pretty quiet since we left Zhizhu's cave, you okay? Truth? Being taken over by a 1000-year-old evil Dragon Master is kind of a drag. But, there is one thing good about it. - What's that? - Now, I know I can fight back, and I have friends who aren't afraid to help me do that. BAO: Ladies... yeah, we got a problem. NU HAI: What's going on? I thought this was the way out. Yeah, according to this map, there's supposed to be an exit door here. Well, of course there is. [MUSIC] [GASPS] - You?! - Us? - They were in their cell. - Apparently not. Clever girl, well done. How does it feel not to be in control, bird? [GRUNTS] Take them! Now! [CHITTERS] I am Zhizhu, weapon of the Four Constellations. It is my sworn oath to eat all intruders, and I am hungry! [ROARS] [WATER DEER GRUNTS] Go! This fight is mine! Yours is still to come. Bon chants! [ROARS] Forget the spider! I need those children! [GRUNTING] [PANTING] [FIGHTING GRUNTS] FAN TONG: We have to help him! NU HAI: Finding Master Po is the only way we can help him now. Let's just hope we're not too late. [SIGHS] Um, I see you under the table. No, you can't. You just spoke, from under the table! Oh! [GASPING BREATH] Got me. It was a mistake to bring you here. I know you have trouble with your memory. Trust me, I've been in a few food comas myself, - but you are a part of this. - I'm not. I'm just an old rabbit trying to live his life in peace. If Jindiao gets the power of the Four Constellations, and gains access to the Wellspring, there won't be peace. Not ever. - That is none of my concern. - Well, it should be! Let go of me! [SCREAMS] Whoa! [GASPS] Whoa! This was on the wall of Jindiao's super evil temple. What is it? And why do you have it? It is a spirit urn. I was to bring it to the Constellations. I failed. It was my fault. I killed the Four Constellations. Whoa...
