 [MUSIC] 1x02 - Blue Dragon Plays with Fire PO: [BANGING ON METAL] All right, everybody up! It's Kung Fu time! - First day of class! - Intruder! [SHIVERS NERVOUSLY] Oh! Hey, Master Po! Wow, that would've been bad! [LAUGHS] [AWKWARD CHUCKLE] Yeah. Let's go wake up the others. [ALL GASP] [GRUNTS] [SNORING] Bao?

 Huh? What up, Master Po? Up and at 'em, little guy. - Hey, where's your sister... - Present, Master Po! What are you doing? I was so excited, I couldn't sleep. Here, I made a list of all the Kung Fu I want to learn. Diggin' that Kung Fu 'tude, Nu Hai. We're gonna need it if we're gonna get to the bottom of that insane... Four Constellations Hero Chi you've got. And I've got a surprise for you. I found an amazing new place for us to train! PO: Ta-da! BAO: We're supposed to train all the way up there? Look at all those great stairs, huh!

 You think I was born with this killer bod? No, I earned it. Running up the stairs of the Jade Palace. Race you to the top! [PO STRUGGLING AND PANTING] Am I there? I knew I'd beat those kids to the... Oh, come on! - She's a real beaut', sir. - NU HAI: Yeah, this is good. I'm sure if we slap a little of paint on it, and maybe some nails... Woah! ALL: Woah! [PLANK CREAKS] Kung Fu teachable moment. This new training hall may look less than epic on the outside... but in Kung Fu, it's all about what's inside that counts. Wow. It is so much worse inside. [SNIFFS] - It smells like dying in here. - Yeah, nice. Wonder if I could get this as a scented candle. [GIGGLING] I bet there's even stuff in here we could use to make equipment. No offense, Master Po, but this place is... Perfect! [SCREAMS IN EXCITEMENT] Okay, before we start, let's talk chi. Hero Chi is supposed to go to one master in every generation. And somehow all four of you got it. How did you receive your Hero Chi? I got it from dying and coming back from the Spirit Realm. Which, P.S., I don't recommend. And Master Oogway got it from the Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom. [MUSIC] Wow. [GASPING] No way! [ALL EXCLAIMING] JING: Awesome! You guys got your individual powers for a reason. Now that's some serious chi power you kids are rockin'. We could easily blow the roof off this place if we don't control it. And, uh... What? - We... - About that... We don't know how we got our chi to show up the other night. We got jack squat in the clue department, Sir! That's okay. We'll figure it out together. It's gotta still be in there. You, Fan Tong. [FAN TONG WHIMPERS] You got Red Phoenix, right? PO: Master Red Phoenix was the most courageous Constellation of all. Willing to jump into the middle of the most dangerous battles and, and... Fan Tong? Where'd he go? - He's probably peeing his pants. - Correction. "Peed." So maybe we've got some work to do. Okay, who's got White Tiger? Right here! Hyah! PO: White Tiger was an excellent healer, and such a chill guy. His chillness was legendary. Everyone who ever met him was like, "Man, that dude's so chill. "He wouldn't even hurt a fly." Hyah! [FLY BUZZES] Jing, what are you doing? Just trying to hurt this fly. It looked at me weird! - Hyah! - Chill. [FLY BUZZES] [BUZZING STOPS] Moving on. Master Black Tortoise. What-what! PO: Always put the needs of others above his own. He was the most selfless of all the Four Constellations. One time he even stopped a meteor from hitting the Earth... ...using only his chi. BAO: Aw, yeah! I'm the best at being selfless, y'all! Ooh-ah! Ooh-ah! Ooh-ah! [SNIGGERS] Can I go next? I assigned a ton of homework to myself to prepare for our first class... So I know all about Master Blue Dragon. NU HAI: Blue Dragon was the leader. Smart, focused, always knew what to do. And he was a crack shot with a bow and arrow. Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew! Ha-haa! Got ya! Pew, pew, pew... [HESITANTLY] Pew! How come she gets a bow and arrow, and all I do is heal? Lame. I wanna trade with Nu Hai. You know what? I'd like to upgrade to a cooler power, too. [BOTH FIGHTING] I'll take the turtle! I like turtles. - No, guys, come on. You can't trade. - BAO: Not the face! Chi doesn't work that way. [CONTINUE FIGHTING] _ [BONES CRACKING] [CRACK] Oh... Ah, these old bones. [CHUCKLES] Many blessings, sisters and brothers. We are all connected by the chi of the universe. Legend tells that the original Dragon Warrior subsisted on nothing more... than the dew from a ginkgo leaf, and the chi of the universe.[ALL EXCLAIM] [LAUGHS] Yes, it may sound far-fetched... but I have been sustaining myself with chi for as long as I can remember. Keeps me young. And... A thousand apologies, sisters and brothers, it seems I'm needed elsewhere. [STRAINING] Could someone help me up, please? Have you lost your mind, Jade Tusk? Showing your face in my monastery. - Ooh! Drama! - Silence, Huifang! We are never to be seen together above-ground. I have had enough of your failure... - Master, I've located Pious Chan. - Who's Pious Chan? Can someone please get her out of here? Lure her away with a snack, or something! Why do you show her such kindness, Master? Her uncle works for the emperor. Now where can I find Pious Chan? In a cave, half-a-day's journey from here. I will bring him to you, Master. No. I should pay a personal visit to our old friend. By the by, what do you think of my winter plumage? I think it's very slimming. You are always divine in my eyes, Master. Right answer. Master Po, wait until you see what we have done in here. It is spiffy. I can't even believe we're related sometimes. Wow! Sweet bodacious bodacity! This place looks awesome! Dang! We really Kung Fu'ed the crud out of this dump. There sure is a lot less moist garbage than before. Yeah, if you ignore how bad it smells in here, this place is probably like the Jade Palace. We've got one of those! And that thing! Ha! Hoo! Hee! Hiya! [GASPS IN FEAR] Oh! Chill, Nu Hai. Let's take a breath and focus. Not jump ahead of ourselves. Right. [BREATHES DEEPLY] Wow, you're right, I do feel more focused. [EXCITED] I love Kung Fu! [SCREAMS] Me too! I painted a face on this dummy! His name is "Fan Tong Junior." [LAUGHS] All righty! Let's see what we're working with. [MUSIC] - Woah! - Yaaa! [GRUNTING] [RINGS BELL THRICE] Aw! [AGGRESSIVE SCREAMING] [BELL BANGS] [PO CRASHES] Great first week, everybody! You guys are really coming along. Right here. Give me some paw. Yeah! Right there, yeah! Whoa! I'll do a little research on the Four Cs while you're at school tomorrow. See if there's anything that might help us unlock that Hero Chi. But I think we're on the right track. We're just regular kids. What if this was all a mistake? There are no accidents! And I'm going to prove it. Hmm? The Master will be pleased to see there's still powerful chi running through those old veins, Pious Chan. You are lucky the Master needs you alive. JINDIAO: Oh, Jade Tusk... Must everything be so dramatic with you? Grand Abbot Jindiao? Your Holiness, who are these monks? I've never seen them at the Temple of the Heavenward Plum Blossom. Master Chan, I require your help. [COUGHS] The Hero Chi of the Masters of the Four Constellations has been found. That's amazing. Uh, one teensy wrinkle. Apparently the chi is being guarded by a fat ridiculous panda claiming to be the Dragon Master. I don't understand, Grand Abbot. - What do you need from me? - So glad you asked. Pious Chan, my dear old friend. I need your... Chi. [GROWLING] [CHAN SCREAMS] I'm surprised to see you, Master Po. Well, I can't be saving the world all the time, right? No, I meant, you don't strike me as much of a reader. Oh! Ouch. Okay. Good feedback. Look, I need to see whatever scrolls you have on the Legend of the Four Constellations. All of a sudden, everybody's got Four Constellations fever! Oh? You're welcome. Don't eat, or make a mess, or do anything weird in here while I'm gone. Pfft! You make sure you don't do anything weird, old timer. [GRUNTS] Ow! [MOANS] The universe picked us to be special-er than I already was. I don't see why we still have to go to regular school. Guys, I hear you, but as your leader... - As our, huh? - Yeah, who decided that? Uh, the universe? It saw my natural leadership skills and decided I was Blue Dragon. "Leadership skills"? [SCOFFS] Like what? Organized. Excellent speller. Always five minutes early. Willingness to try strange foods. Arithmetic. Need I go on? PING: Attention, everyone! I come bearing a message for the Dragon Master. Bandits have overtaken Wu-Ran Village and the local constable requests his help. We are the Dragon Master's students. I am the leader. Still up for debate. We will deliver your message to Master Po. Oh. Your kindness warms my heart. [BABY PANDA CHUCKLING] Hey, does this cafe have a public bathroom, or do I have to buy something? Oh-em-gosh, you guys! This is huge. I know! Delivering mail! Somebody pinch me. But not too hard. No. Don't you see? We couldn't get our chi to work at the Training Hall... But remember what happened when we fought those warrior monks? - Boom! Chi! - That's... not totally dumb. Like Master Po said, "There are no accidents." This has to be the universe pointing us to our destiny! No, no, no. We should definitely deliver this straight to Master Po. Oh, I'm sorry, kids. Po's not here right... Welp we tried. Let's go save a town. Are you forgetting what Master Po said about... "taking a breath" and "not getting ahead of yourself"? I bet if we took out those bandits, you'd be famous. Let's go be heroes, y'all! Woo! [READING TO HIMSELF] Argh! Come on! [GASPS] Ow! "Many have sung the praises of the Masters of the Four Constellations. But few ever mention their humble origin..." Huh? What a mess. [PO SCREAMING] Ow! Ow! [THUD] Okay, that's enough. Come on! Okay, that tickles. Oh. Hey! Dragon Master! Back already? Huh? Back from Wu-Ran Village? [PANDA CRASHES AND CHUCKLES] Your, your students said they'd give you the message. "Message"? [SCREAMING IN FEAR] NU HAI: Holy underpants! Guys, it's time to get our chi on and save this town! [YAKS LAUGHING] [CLEARS THROAT] Halt, evil-doers! Your days of crime are over. ALL: Hmm? Hmm? [YAKS LAUGHING] Come on! You want a piece of me? [SCREAMING] Okay, heat of battle! Ready to go! Here comes the chi! [STRAINING] NU HAI: Any minute now. [AGGRESSIVE GRUNTING] Your aggressive grunting does not seem to be slowing them down. Okay, we might have gotten ahead of ourselves here. Uh... New plan. What would Master Po do? Okay, everybody split up! No, no, no, stay together! What's the ding-dang plan, "leader"? Come on Nu Hai, think! You got this! Think! Come on! Into that alley! [PANDAS PANTING] [BOTH STRUGGLING] Yeah! Ha-haa! [GASPS] [GROWLS] [PANDAS SCREAM] Hello, hello. [SCREAMING] What have we here? [BOTH CONTINUE SCREAMING] Wait! Nu Hai! [NU HAI GRUNTS] [YAK LAUGHS] [SCREAMING] [ROARING] [GULPS] [EVIL LAUGHTER] [PANDAS STRUGGLING] Think, come on! Come on, Nu Hai, think! You got this! PO: Just take a breath. Focus. [BREATHES IN] [MUSIC] [WAR CRY] [GRUNTS] Woah! That was so cool! Oh, Master Po's here? I'm just gonna go ahead and... Uh... What the heck are you guys doing out here? [YAKS LAUGHING] Hold that thought. [PO SCREAMS] [FIGHTING] Where was I? Oh, right. You had one week of Kung Fu training! You're not ready for this! You could've gotten hurt! Don't be mad at them. This was my idea. Well, I'd, like, be way madder if this wasn't so awesome! And you hit that dude, like blaow! And taking the heat for your mistake? That's legit leader skills right there. Oh! How did you do that chi thing? I just stopped and took a breath. Like you taught me. Awesome! I taught you that! I totally taught her that! Now we just gotta figure out how to get the rest of your guys' Hero Chi activated. But clearly I'm an excellent teacher, and you guys are excellent students. Chiggy-ty-check this out. Did a little research-a-rooney. Turns out the Four Constellations didn't start out as masters of chi either. They were farmers and shopkeepers. Humble origins. And they found the greatness inside of themselves. Just like we're gonna do. Together. [MUSIC] We should have nothin' to worry about. - You look well, Master. - JINDIAO: Hmm. Yes, I do, don't I? Our old friend Pious Chan's chi did not disappoint. [BREATHES DEEPLY] I feel more like my old self already.
