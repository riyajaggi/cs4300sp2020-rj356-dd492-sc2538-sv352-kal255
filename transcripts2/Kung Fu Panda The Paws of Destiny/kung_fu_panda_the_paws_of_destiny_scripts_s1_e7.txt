 [TITLE MUSIC] 1x07 - Big Trouble in Panda Village PO: I will never let you take my chi. NU HAI: [EXCLAIMING] Master Po! JINDIAO: Goodbye, so-called Dragon Master! - No! - It's too late. We gotta get outta here. JINDIAO: Children, I beg you not to put up a fight. It'll only make things worse. You have no choice but to surrender your Hero Chi to me. Just as your pathetic former master did.

 I think we should give our chi to Master Jindiao. We can't win. We're outnumbered. - Master Po isn't here to help. - Jing, what is your deal? [LAUGHING] [JINDIAO LAUGHING] [EXCLAIMING] Hiya! - Get them! - Run! [GRUNTING] [MUSIC] Jing, let's go. Move your panda butt! - Jing! - Nu Hai, it's too late. Come on! Oh, awesome! You guys! We're in trouble and we need you to help us with your epic Kung Fu skills. Oh, yeah, we're more comfortable in a tournament setting.

 - Seriously? - Raah! Are we really leaving Jing behind? Bro, she betrayed Master Po! But, Nu Hai, she's your best friend. Jindiao has turned her against us. If we don't save ourselves now, we'll never get a chance to save her later. [THUD] Well, you tried. You did what you could with power you didn't earn. And now you will give that power to Master Jindiao. [PANTING] [GROWLS] What do we do? Any ideas? Huh? Anything? I'm stumped. You're always saying you're the leader, right? So just lead. Okay, I just need a minute to collect my thoughts. Never mind. Jump! [SCREAMING] I did not see that coming. [GRUNTS] Oh, sorry. [SCREAMING] [MUSIC] How did you know this would work? That's the dopest part. I didn't. I just jumped and kinda hoped for the best. [STILL SCREAMING] What do you mean they jumped over the railing? I know, right? I was like "whaaat?" Master, we cornered them. - We had them dead to rights. - Find them. I will not squander this chance to reclaim what is mine. Looks like you're alone in the world, little panda. [SIGHS] No friends. No Po. I'm all you have left. BUNNIDHARMA: [EXCLAIMING] Whoa. [LAUGHING] Oh, this is, this is very heavy. [ALL PANTING] Oh, gosh! That was... Whew! I-I gotta take a knee. And... [GASPING] Maybe a nap. [GASPS] Guys, uh, guys, I don't think this is the best place to rest. - Why not? - 'Cause they found us. Okay, I'm up. I'm up. Got my second wind. - Let's go! - We're never gonna outrun them. [SNIFFING] I can still smell them. They couldn't have gotten far. [STOMACH GRUMBLING] [STOMACH GRUMBLING] [EXCLAIMING] Whoops. That must've been my tummy. It was saying, "Give me snacks." [ANNOYED GROWL] [GRUNTS] Keep looking! Search every inch of this forest. [GRUNTING] [THUD] BAO: [EXCLAIMING] Dude. [CRIES] Nu Hai, you okay? No, I'm not. My best friend turned against us and betrayed Master Po. What're we even supposed to do? Maybe we should just think about what Master Po would do, and do that. No. Master Po's not here. You're in charge now, sis. We should think about what you would do. You're our leader. [SNIFFING] You're right. Okay, so Jindiao will probably assume we're headed back to Panda Village. Which means that everybody we know is in deep... Trouble. There's gonna be plenty of time for crying later. Right now, we've gotta get back and protect our village. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] BUNNIDHARMA: [EXCLAIMING] Oh. [LAUGHING] [GASPS AND SCREAMS] [CLATTERING] Huh? Where am I? Ow! Hey, what was that for. You ask me a question. [GULPS] I hit you with a stick. You say nothing. I also hit you with a stick. Hey! You think about talking, but then say nothing. Ow, ow, ow. Yeah, I get it, you hit me with a stick. You are in my cave. I found you in the snow. You looked pretty dead. But you weren't. Good for you. Oh, come on! [GIGGLING] [BELL TONGING] [GASPS] Whoa! NU HAI: Everyone listen up! We've got a huge announcement. Now I don't wanna freak anybody out, but there is something very bad coming our way. And that very-bad-something is... [INHALES] Grand Abbot Jindiao. Grand Abbot Jindiao? [LAUGHTER] Oh, come on. He's a perfect gentleman. No, I'm serious. Jindiao is not who we all thought he was. He's really a thousand-year-old evil dragon. [LAUGHS] Kids, surely there's a mistake. That kindly old man wouldn't hurt a fly. Oh! He'd hurt a lot more than a fly. He kicked Master Po... [EXCLAIMING] He kicked my little baby boy? Wait. Where's Po? [CRYING] He's fine! Po's perfectly fine! - But he sent us to warn you. - For real, something hecka bad is coming toward the village. We need to lock it down. Jindiao is after our powerful Hero Chi. Right. And I still got most of my teeth. Get it? 'Cause I'm old and I don't floss regularly. We're serious. It's all of our duty to protect the village. Oh, to have the mind of a child again. [LAUGHING] Kids, it's all sounding a little far-fetched. I mean, why should we believe you? 'Cause this. [VILLAGERS GASP] [MUSIC] I know this all sounds crazy, but we're in a crazy situation right now and we're running out of time. Jindiao is on his way right now. He wants us! He wants our power. And without your help, he's probably gonna get it. And that's bad for everybody. So please help us stop him. [COOING] NU HAI: Please. For the future of our village. [RAP SONG PLAYING] Well, let's hope that's enough to keep the bad guys at bay. Well, it's the only way into the village. There's no reason to think that... Come on. You gotta be freakin' kidding me. PO: [EXCLAIMING] Whoa, hey! You've got Four Constellations action figures? Whooo. Ah-ta-taa. [GRUNTS] Ow! Oh. Okay, I get it. I'm a collector too. You don't want my grubby paws on 'em, 'cause it'll ruin the resale value. I'm totally down with that. You gotta keep 'em mint condition. It's all about the mint condish. What is wrong with you? I am really asking. Look, buddy, I'm getting a little sick of this stick thing you keep doing. I mean, I totally get that it's your thang, but, uh, I'm needed elsewhere. So I'm out. Vaya con dios, cotton tail. [SCREAMS] Now will you tell me what is wrong with you? I... It's gonna sound crazy, but I lost my chi. This evil dude drained it outta me! It also feels like he might've taken the bones out of my legs. I'm not sure, 'cause I'm real wobbly here. Hey, don't worry. We'll find your lost chi. Yeah? I don't know. [LAUGHS] Oh, sorry. I was only laughing because of how pathetic you are. - Never gets old. - Aargh! [GRUNTING] Noodle cart attack! Oh, I feel so alive! I'm here, if anyone needs me! I think we're sort of winning! [EVIL LAUGHTER] JINDIAO: There is no reason to fight, gentle pandas. Especially since you cannot win, and we will crush you. [GRUNTS AND GROANS] Jing! You and your friends will surrender to me or I will wipe this entire village off the map. I'm sorry, Nu Hai. This is my fault. So what will it be? Your chi? Or the lives of every panda in Panda Village? Oh, and do decide quickly. [PO GROANS] What are you doing? I'm trying to fix whatever is wrong with you. What is wrong with you again? I lost my chi and got kicked off the side of a mountain, remember? Oh, right. That was you, huh? My memory's a little... nonexistent sometimes. You promised to help me get my Hero Chi back. Yes, yes. And you're still too weak to move and you're in a hurry because you are worried about your students. I-I never mentioned anything about my students. Hey, my memory's shot, but everything else seems to be working pretty good. Okay, that doesn't even begin to answer my... Hold that thought. I'm going to try to fix you. [GRUNTING] Hey, how'd you do that? I'm all better. As soon as I've found my students, I'll swing back by to give you a proper thank you. Maybe bring you a nice casserole or something. Okay. Thanks, again, buddy. Mad respect. Catch you on the flip side. Of course, you still don't have your Hero Chi. [GASPS] I don't? No offense, but you're probably not gonna get that casserole now. Where's my chi? How do I get my chi back? How did you harness your chi the first time? Hard work. Heck, I almost trained my panda butt off. Almost. I mean, my butt's still there, but... Well then. You have your answer. You will train with me. Uh, do you even know Kung Fu? Sure! Quick. Try to hit me in the fa... I wasn't ready. Try again. Oh, no, no, no, I couldn't. You're an elderly gentleman and I don't wanna... Punch me again, you big wussy baby! Oh, it's like that? - It is, in fact, like that. - Aw, yeah! [GRUNTING] [MUSIC] [PANTING] Dude, seriously, who are you? Your decision, young panda. Yeah. Uh... Can you repeat the question? Cease this stalling! - Any ideas? - Nah, this is all you. How do we know our village will be safe - if we turn ourselves in? - You have my word. Uh, no offense but you've been lying about who you are for like a thousand years. So it's a skosh hard to trust anything you say. Once I have the chi you possess, I'll have no use for your little... village. [DRY GULP] This is your call. We got your back. Wise choice. Now, to prevent any of you from trying to play hero... Yo! Not cool! Guys, I think they're just sleeping. They will all awaken from their slumber as long as the four of you cooperate. [MUSIC] [STRAINING] [GASPING] [GROANING] Perhaps a rousing song might lift our spirits. And a-one, and a-two, and a... How're you not terrified right now? Oh, sometimes when something really scares me, I think of something even worse and the scary thing feels less scary. Like for instance, at least we're not on fire or being stung by jellyfishes. Yay. [SCREAMS] You ever touch me again, I'm gonna yank those fangs outta your face and feed 'em to you. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, - here comes the traitor. - Are you okay? We were so worried. Forget that! You totally sold us out and turned on us. No, I didn't! That feathered turd used his chi to take over my brain somehow. - How? - I don't know. It started when I healed Jindiao. - Somehow he got his hooks in me. - You're with us now. You're safe. Ish. Safe-ish. Actually, probably not safe at all. But, hey, we've got each other. How do we know Jindiao's not using her to trick us? He could be in her head listening to everything we say. Or he could get her to, you know, de-life us in our sleep. Aw, Jing, that's real disappointing. Bao's right! Jindiao could do all that! Weird thing to get excited about. Maybe it works both ways. Maybe Jing can get into Jindiao's mind. And we could see what he sees, or, or make him do our bidding. There's no way. Jindiao is way too powerful. I felt it first-hand. I would never be strong enough. NU HAI: You're right. You wouldn't. Not alone. But you're not alone. You've got us. And if we work together and combined our chi, maybe we can kick Jindiao out of Jing's head. Fine. I guess we gotta stick together or whatever. - Yes! We did it! - [GASPS] Did we? I don't know. Jing, did we? I hope. Something still doesn't feel quite right. - Hmm. - Ow! Your posture is horrible. You need to fix this. - Ow! - And this! This! This, this, this. This. And ow! Is that really necessary? I mean, I'm the Dragon Master. You're not just a Dragon Master. You're a panda. Pandas are special. It is why the Ancient Masters chose the pandas as Guardians. Guardians? What the heck does that even mean? I don't know. Anyway, good chat. Wait. Wait, w-where are you go... [SIGHS] [GRUNTS] Whoa! Hey, weird rabbit guy! I think it's actually working! Okay, I'll show you later. [GRUNTS] [SNORING] Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh. Guys! - Wait. That color. - What's up? Huh? Master Po... He's alive.
