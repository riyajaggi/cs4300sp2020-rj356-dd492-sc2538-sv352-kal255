 - You sure it's the same one dad? - Now I'm not sure of anything Sandy. All I saw was her name on the camping permit, you took it from there. - Well I only saw her once last year in the championship finals. Boy was she something. You never saw anything in the water so smooth. - Sure I did! Him. - Well, Flipper was born in the water.

 For him it's just natural. But to learn to ski like Linda Granville, boy that would be really something. - Well there's her trailer. - Mrs. Granville? . Yes? - I'm Porter Ricks. I'm the park warden here. - Hi. - And these two characters are my sons, Sandy. - Hello. - And Bud. They're great fans of your daughters. - Fans?

 - Is Linda here Mrs. Granville? - Well, yes she's right down there on the beach. - Thanks. - Oh wait. - Linda Granville? - What do you want? - Hi, I'm Sandy Ricks, this is my brother Bud. We brought you something. - He brought you something. It was his idea not mine. - Go ahead, open it. Best picture I ever took. And I made the frame too. What do we do? ♫ They call him Flipper, Flipper ♫ Faster than lightning ♫ No one you see is smarter than he ♫ And we know Flipper lives in a world full of wonder ♫ Lying there under ♫ Under the sea - Goofin' off again eh? While I'm up there slaving! - Goofing off? I've been working. - Yeah. - Dad said he hit an oil drum floating in the water, I was checking for damage. - Where is dad? - Over talking to Linda's mother in their trailer. - There was something on the radio about a special weather report. A storm warning maybe. I'd better tell him. - He'll be right back. But the storm warning will be up around here if that house isn't clean. - Yeah I read ya. - Yeah. - It isn't easy for one parent alone to raise children. - Well I know what you mean. But kids aren't a soft touch in any case. Thank you. - My problem's especially difficult with Linda. See skiing was her whole life. She was completely dedicated. - Yeah Sandy told me. A national champion. - She worked so hard to achieve it. She gave up everything else. School, clothes, everything. - Oh it's you again. That was a very good toss. Thank you very much. You're quite a comedian, you know that? Of course you do. You're a ham. A real ham. - How did the accident happen? - We were making some publicity pictures. Linda was doing all sorts of fancy turns and tricks. And suddenly a small motor boat came out of nowhere, crashed into her. It just about destroyed both of us. You see, I was partly to blame. I pushed too hard for her success. - It was an accident wasn't it? - But it was the end for Linda. - What do the doctors say? - Oh, I've had so many opinions. Too many doctors and hospitals, tests, specialists. None of them could give any concrete encouragement. So finally Linda just stopped hoping. Stopped caring. - What'd they tell you? - Well the doctor we have now says that he can't find any permanent nerve damage. He wants to operate but he can't help her unless she's got the will to get well. - She's that bitter. - She's that disappointed. - The epicenter of Hurricane Emma is moving north and will miss the coastline. However winds of 60 to 70 miles velocity with gusts considerably higher are predicted for the coastal region before noon. All stations post storm warnings and take all hurricane precautions. Out. - Well there it is boys. Emma sounds like a real little doozy. - Yeah. Dad, how come they always name hurricanes after girls? - Well give or take a couple years Bud, I think you'll be able to figure that one out yourself. - Maybe it's because you can't ever figure out what they're gonna do. - Yeah. Alright I want you guys to put up the storm shutters and batten everything down around here. I'm going down to the beach and warn those people to get their trailers out. - Okay dad. - Hey Snap it up huh? I'll take care of the launch when I get back. - Here take this. - Where are you going? - To warn Flipper! I'll be right back. - Well hurry up huh? - Mr. Ricks. - Mrs. Granville, there's a hurricane heading this way. - I know, we heard it on the radio. - Well don't let this lull fool you. I'm advising all the campers to take their trailers and move to the park in town. - But Linda won't go. - Won't go? Alright young lady, what's this nonsense about? - No nonsense. I wanna stay here, that's all. - Well apparently you didn't hear. That's a killer hurricane out there. - I know. It might be exciting. An experience. - An experience? Staying here could be suicide. - So. - So if you don't care that much about yourself why don't you start thinking about your mother! - Look, you're not my keeper! I'm not doing anything wrong. You can't make me go. - We'll see about that. - Let go of me! Don't you touch me! - You go on Mr. Ricks. Got a lot of other people to worry about. I'll handle Linda. After all I am her mother. - Flipper! Flipper! Flipper there's a hurricane coming! It's gonna be mighty rough in here. You better go out to sea where it's safe okay? Just 'till it's over, then come right back! Okay? - Thousands of small boats have been damaged or sunk. Hundreds of trees destroyed, many buildings damaged. So far no fatalities reported but hospitals have treated many injuries and this is the first major hurricane of the season. - Dad. Dad! Come here dad. Listen. Dad I think the storm's letting up, listen. - You think we're in the eye dad? They say in the eye of a hurricane it's real quiet. - No Emma's eye was supposed to pass up by fortunately. It's just a lull. It'll pick up again. - Maybe she's winking. - Dad wait, listen. - A car horn. - An SOS. You suppose it's a joke? - In a hurricane? What do you think? Sandy get the raincoats. Bud, you stay by the radio. Anybody calls, you tell them we're at the park area. - Okay dad. - It's starting up again! - Hurricane Emma is now moving northward with wind velocities of 90 miles an hour. It is expected... - There's the car dad! - Mrs. Granville, where's Linda? - In the trailer. We tried to get out. - Alright you stay here! Come on Sandy. Alright Sandy, heave! Let's get this table out of here! - I'm sorry! We waited too long. The wheels got stuck in the sand. - Go ahead mother tell them the truth. I wouldn't go. - You were lucky we heard that horn. You could have had a real experience. You might have caused your mother's death along with your own. - Okay Mrs. Granville, over this way a little bit. - Here comes dad, he's got the trailer loose. - Okay Mrs. Granville, that's good enough. It takes four wheel drive and traction tires. Your tires would just slip. - Give me a hand huh? - Thanks. But I can't really use this. I'm leaving. Oh Flipper, you're so funny. - Bud and I can manage the rest. You go tell Linda that we're about ready to go. - Fine dad. - I'm sorry things didn't work out better for you. - Well I didn't really have much hope. We could have done without Hurricane Emma though. - The weather should be better now. A lot better. Won't you change your mind? Stay? - I'm afraid not. - Hey Linda! They told me to come and tell you. Flipper! You'd sit there and let him drown. - Drown? A fish? - He's not a fish, he's an animal. He breathes air just like us. Linda! - What happened to Sandy and Linda? Why don't you go tell them we're ready alright? ' Okay. - Now, all you have to do is follow me over to the house. - Right. ' Okay? - Linda, Linda. ' Dad! Dad! Dad hurry! Dad! - No. - Linda! - Help! Help. - Linda. Linda. - Watch your legs, watch your legs. - Linda baby. - She was unconscious. - She'll be alright Mrs. Granville. Sandy get my first aid kit. - I'll go with you. - Come on sit up. Help her up. Well Mr. Ricks, I can't thank you enough. - Sure is a good picture of you Linda. - I'll always keep it. I don't care if the water did spoil it. A lot of things get spoiled. I'm sorry mother. You know whenever I look at this, I'm going to think of all of you and Flipper. - Just 'till you come back again. - You are coming back? - Deal? - Deal. That is. - But you said your legs are better. - I think they are. I mean I felt a sort of tingling when I tried to swim out to Flipper. - Well you just tell that to your doctor young lady. That's all he needs to know. He'll take it from there. - How about that? - Yeah. And when you come back, you can teach us how to water ski. - Maybe. - Boy that would really be something. - Sure would. - Well we really have to go now. Goodbye and thanks again. - Goodbye. - Gee thanks. - Bye. - Bye Linda. - So long Flipper! ♫ Everyone loves a king of the sea ♫ Ever so kind and gentle is he ♫ Tricks he will do when children are near ♫ And how they love when he's near ♫ They call him Flipper, Flipper ♫ Faster than lightning ♫ No one you see is smarter than he ♫ And we know Flipper lives in a world full of wonder ♫ Lying there under ♫ Under the sea
