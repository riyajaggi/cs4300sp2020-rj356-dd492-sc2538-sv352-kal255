 {\an1}CROWD (chanting): Sisterhood is powerful! Join us now! {\an1}Sisterhood is powerful, join us now! {\an1}Sisterhood is powerful, join us now! {\an1}Sisterhood is powerful, join us now! WALTER CRONKITE: 50 years ago today, {\an1}the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution {\an1}gave women the right to vote. {\an1}On this anniversary, {\an1}a militant minority of women's liberationists {\an1}was on the streets.

 CROWD: Free ourselves! (crowd chanting) REPORTER: So remember, men, if you come to work tomorrow {\an1}and your secretary refuses to do the filing, {\an1}and then go home and find {\an1}that your wife has refused to do the cooking, {\an1}don't blame them. {\an1}Remember, you gave them the vote 50 years ago. (crowd chanting) NARRATOR: It had been the opening act in what proved to be an epic struggle for equality-- {\an7}a crusade carried out by millions of women {\an7}over the better part of a century {\an7}to secure for themselves the right to vote,

 {\an7}and thereby participate in America's democracy. {\an1}MARCIA CHATELAIN: To be disenfranchised is to be told {\an1}that you do not matter, {\an1}because the right to vote {\an1}is about the power that governs your possibilities. MICHAEL WALDMAN: The right to vote is the heart of democracy, {\an1}and if half the countrydoesn't have the right to vote, {\an1}you're nowhere near being a democracy. PAULA GIDDINGS: Women would go out canvassing, and the men would be terrible to them. {\an1}They'd say, "Are you trying to wear the pants in the family?" {\an1}And, "This is male territory," {\an1}and, "How dare these women begin to come in {\an1}and make a difference." (cannon booms) MARTHA JONES: This struggle is going on at the same time that the nation is resolving the Civil War. {\an1}So to introduce women is to disrupt a political culture {\an1}that is built on exclusion, {\an1}that is built on the notion that politics {\an1}is a white man's business. ELAINE WEISS: It's a civil rights battle. We don't think of it like that, {\an1}but it truly is a great civil rights battle. {\an1}Suffragists have to change the idea {\an1}of what women's role in society will be. {\an1}What is her claim on citizenship? ELEANOR SMEAL: The textbooks when I went to school said women were given the vote. {\an1}We weren't given anything. We took it. ♪ NARRATOR: On June 29, 1909, {\an1}a 24-year-old American student named Alice Paul {\an1}made her way through the streets of London {\an1}and joined a contingent of some 200 other women {\an1}headed for the Houses of Parliament. {\an1}Once there, they planned to insist on an audience {\an1}with the prime minister {\an1}and press him for the right to vote, {\an1}a fundamental exercise of citizenship, {\an1}known as suffrage, {\an1}that was then denied to women {\an1}in most of the world's democracies. {\an1}ALEXANDER KEYSSAR: The right to vote is fundamental. {\an1}It's a key ingredient in letting people have equal voice and equal power. {\an1}It gives you a way to protect yourself. {\an7}And the opposite of it-- not having the right to vote-- {\an7}in some political sense, leaves you helpless. NARRATOR: When Alice Paul had arrived in England two years earlier, {\an1}she'd had no thought {\an1}of joining the crusade for woman suffrage. {\an1}She'd come, as she put it,to "see something of the world," and had enrolled in a graduate economics class at the University of Birmingham, {\an1}the first woman ever to do so. {\an1}Then, one day on campus, {\an1}she'd spotted a notice about an upcoming lecture. {\an1}The name was one she knew. {\an1}Christabel Pankhurst, {\an1}along with her mother, Emmeline, {\an1}was a co-founder of the Women's Social and Political Union, {\an1}Britain's notoriously militant suffrage organization. J.D. ZAHNISER: Alice Paul had followed the Pankhursts with her mother in the newspaper. {\an7}They were getting a lot of newspaper coverage in America, {\an7}and a lot of people were excited about what they were doing-- things that were so controversial {\an1}that American women could not imagine {\an1}them happening in America. JAD ADAMS: There have been votes in the House of Commons {\an1}since the 19th century {\an1}in favor of women's suffrage, {\an1}but there's no real progress taking place. {\an1}And so, in anger at this political stagnation, {\an1}they actually start doing things {\an7}which will get them sent to prison. ♪ ELLEN DUBOIS: They started with mass demonstrations-- {\an7}demonstrations of 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 people {\an7}demanding the right to vote. TINA CASSIDY:They were passing out pamphlets on the street. {\an1}They were standing on literal soapboxes {\an1}on the street corners of London {\an7}and explaining why women deserved the right to vote. {\an1}At the time, standingon a soapbox on a street corner {\an1}was something that only men did. {\an1}(woman speaking indistinctly, crowd clamoring) ZAHNISER: They would go to political meetings and they would interrupt politicians, {\an1}which was considered extremely rude. {\an1}And they were literally dragged out of these meetings. {\an1}Nothing like this had ever been done before. {\an1}The idea was to really get enough attention {\an1}in order to draw the members of Parliament, {\an1}but also the public, {\an1}into the cause of suffrage. NARRATOR: So aggressive were the women of the Pankhurst army {\an1}that a British journalist had concocted {\an1}a twist on the term "suffragist" to identify them, {\an1}derisively dubbing them "suffragettes." DUBOIS: Ridicule is one of the great weapons {\an1}against women's assertion, {\an1}and that's what was going on {\an1}with calling suffragists "suffragettes." {\an1}It minimized them. {\an1}It turned them into asmall version of what they were. NARRATOR: No amount of mockery in the press, however, {\an1}had prepared Alice Paul for what happened {\an1}at Christabel Pankhurst's lecture. {\an1}There were lots of male students {\an1}from the University of Birmingham there, {\an1}and they were hooting and hollering {\an1}and singing songs and throwing things. {\an1}Someone threw a mouse, a dead mouse. {\an1}And it was total pandemonium. ZAHNISER: Alice witnessed Christabel Pankhurst, {\an1}who was no slouch on the speaking platform, {\an1}essentially being shouted down and being unable to speak. NARRATOR: Paul would remember it as a turning point. {\an1}PAUL (dramatized): I became from that moment very anxious {\an1}to help in this movement. {\an1}You know if you feel some group that's your group is the underdog, {\an1}you want to try to help-- it's natural. And when I saw this outbreak of hostility, {\an1}I understood everything {\an1}about what the English suffragists were trying to do. ♪ MARY WALTON: Alice Paul was a Quaker. {\an1}Quakers believe that everyone is equal in the eyes of God, {\an7}regardless of gender, regardless of race, {\an7}regardless of religion. ZAHNISER: Quakers believed in educating boys and girls equally, and so she had never experienced the reality of inequality. {\an1}And she began to realize {\an1}that there was a whole other world out there {\an1}where women were not necessarily treated equally. NARRATOR: Some months after the lecture, {\an1}Paul had written to her mother back home in New Jersey, "I have joined the suffragettes." ♪ {\an1}Now she was marching with them to Parliament {\an1}to demand for British women the right to vote. WALTON: Emmeline Pankhurst leads the deputation {\an1}up to the gates of Parliament. And suddenly, they're stormed by police. {\an7}Women are thrown to the ground and they're trampled. {\an1}PAUL (dramatized): The scene was one awful nightmare. {\an1}The police grabbed the suffragettes by the throats and threw them flat on their backs {\an1}over and over again. {\an1}Finally, when the police could not drive the women back {\an1}or control the scene, {\an1}the suffragettes were arrested. ♪ (crowd clamoring) NARRATOR: In all, 112 women were hauled off to the police station, {\an1}"half-fainting," one observed, {\an1}"and their clothes torn to pieces." {\an1}Alice Paul was among them. {\an1}It was the first time Paul had been arrested. {\an1}But having become, as she said, a "heart-and-soul convert" to the cause of woman suffrage-- {\an1}a cause now reaching its crescendo-- {\an1}this arrest would by no means be her last. ♪ {\an1}In the United States, {\an1}the suffragettes' so-called "siege" of Parliament {\an1}was met with incredulity and scorn. This was not, newspapers made plain, {\an1}the way that women should behave. By 1909, it was a familiar refrain. More than six decades had passed {\an1}since the clamor for woman suffrage first was raised, {\an1}most loudly at a convention inSeneca Falls, New York, in 1848. {\an1} ♪ Some 300 people had come that July {\an1}to discuss the rights of women, and had listened as 32-year-old abolitionist {\an1}Elizabeth Cady Stanton {\an1}decried the lack of them, {\an1}provocatively comparing her condition, {\an1}as a free married woman with children, to slavery. {\an1}"We assemble to protest against a form of government {\an1}existing without the consent of the governed," {\an1}Stanton proclaimed, {\an1}"to declare our right to be free as man is free." ♪ DUBOIS: At the time of Seneca Falls,a woman had no legal existence. When married, {\an1}she was "absorbed into the person of her husband." {\an1}Now, that would be fine {\an1}if there were women who weren't married, {\an1}but adult women were overwhelmingly married women, {\an1}and they had no legal standing. WALTON: Married women could not sign a contract. If they worked outside the home, {\an1}they couldn't keep their paycheck. {\an1}It went to their husbands. {\an1}If they dared to divorce, {\an1}husbands retained custody of the children. {\an1}The doors of public universities were closed to them. {\an1}There were just many, many ways {\an1}in which they were second-class citizens. ♪ NARRATOR: The Declaration of Sentiments adopted by the convention {\an1}had been modeled on the Declaration of Independence. {\an1}And included a list of resolutions {\an1}outlining the rights to which women, as citizens, {\an1}should be entitled. WEISS: Seneca Falls is the first {\an1}very public demonstration and announcement {\an7}that women are asking for a whole series of rights that they feel they've been denied. {\an1}And it is considered really radical. {\an1}They're fighting for education. {\an7}They're fighting for the right to own property. {\an1}They want to be full adult American citizens. NARRATOR: Of the 11 resolutions put forward by Stanton, {\an1}only one was considered so controversial that it failed to pass unanimously: Resolution Nine, which demanded for women the right to vote-- {\an1}a right that had engendered equal controversy {\an1}among the men who wrote the U.S. Constitution. ♪ KEYSSAR: One of the remarkable things about the history of democracy {\an1}in the United States {\an1}is that the Constitution, in its original form, {\an1}said nothing about the right to vote. {\an1}When the founding fathers talked about "we, the people," {\an1}they were talking about adult, white males, {\an1}and really, adult white respectable males. {\an1}They had different views {\an1}about how broad the franchise should be. {\an1}So instead of hammering out a consensus view, {\an1}they punted and left voting rights to the states. In most states, the notion was {\an1}that in order to have the franchise, {\an1}you had to be independent insome economic and social sense. {\an1}And women had very fewopportunities to be independent. {\an1} ♪ NARRATOR: Opposed by Stanton's husband-- {\an1}and by her father, who threatened to disown her-- {\an1}woman suffrage found its first male champion {\an1}in Frederick Douglass, who had escaped enslavement {\an1}to become a leader of the abolitionist movement. {\an1}From the abolitionist ranks also came {\an1}the first generation of suffragists: {\an1}Lucretia Mott, Lucy Stone, and Sojourner Truth, {\an1}Frances Ellen Watkins Harper,Sarah Remond, Susan B. Anthony-- {\an1}women for whom the two causes at first were entwined. {\an1}(guns firing, men shouting) {\an1}When the conflict over slaveryfinally exploded into civil war, the suffragists set their own agenda aside to help secure rights for those who'd been enslaved, {\an1}expecting, as Stanton put it, {\an1}that "when the Constitutional door is open, {\an1}"we will avail ourselves {\an1}"of the strong arm and the blue uniform {\an1}"of the black soldier {\an1}to walk in by his side." {\an1}Their rallying cry now was, "Equal voting rights to all." ♪ {\an1}Instead, under pressure from congressional Republicans, {\an1}the party of Lincoln, {\an1}Stanton and her friends were asked in 1869 {\an1}to support the 15th Amendment, {\an1}which extended federal protection for the franchise {\an1}only to African American men. ♪ WEISS: The suffragists truly believe, perhaps naively, that once the war is over, all eligible citizens are going to get the vote. {\an1}They are shattered when they're told {\an1}that the nation cannot handle two great reforms at once. {\an1}They can't swallow black men getting the vote {\an1}and women getting the vote at the same time. {\an1}Frederick Douglass says,"I believe in women's suffrage, {\an1} "I always will, {\an1}"but the black man needs it first. {\an1}My people are being killed." NARRATOR: The question of compromise, once introduced, {\an1}quickly became a wedge. {\an7}"If you will not give the whole loaf of justice {\an7}to the entire people,"Susan B. Anthony told Douglass, {\an7}it should be given "to the most intelligent {\an7}and capable portion of women" first. {\an1}Elizabeth Cady Stanton was less civil. {\an1}"Think of Sambo," she fumed, {\an1}"who never read the Declaration of Independence {\an1}"or Webster's spelling book, {\an1}making laws for educated, refined women." JONES: Stanton and Anthony have constructed the debate {\an1}around the vote as one that positions white women {\an1}against African American men. {\an1}And Stanton in particular has made the argument {\an1}that she will not see former slaves, {\an1}the sons of slaves, enfranchised over elite, educated women. These are ideas that are not uncommon. {\an7}But now racism is sort of in a full-throated way {\an7}part of the deliberations. ♪ NARRATOR: In the end, the fragile coalition {\an1}forged by the Civil War {\an1}was shattered by the terms of the peace, {\an1}and causes once regarded as compatible {\an1}had been set in opposition, {\an1}to be prioritizedone over the other if expedient. {\an1}As Frances Ellen Watkins Harper noted ruefully, {\an1}"When it was a question of race, {\an1}"I let the lesser question of sex go. {\an1}"But the white women all go for sex, {\an1}letting race occupy a minor position." JONES: People will go {\an1}in one direction or another out of this debate-- men and women, black and white. {\an1}There are those who say, "We should remain {\an1}committed to our ideals." {\an1}Then there's others who say, "This is politics, {\an1}and we need to compromise." {\an1}And that has consequences far beyond any encounter in the vestibule of a meeting hall. {\an1}This is mapping, right, {\an1}political culture for the nation-- {\an1}for women, but for the nation. ♪ NARRATOR:By the time African American men {\an1}began to cast ballots and hold office in the South, {\an1}in the early 1870s, {\an1}the first generation of suffragists {\an1}had split over strategy. Some sought to secure women the vote {\an1}by petitioning for changes to state constitutions, {\an1}believing voter eligibility a matter {\an1}more properly determined by the states. {\an1}The rest joined Stanton and Anthony in their quest {\an1}for a federal remedy, {\an1}and tried to push through {\an1}what they hoped would be the 16th Amendment, {\an1}barring the infringement of voting rights {\an1}on the basis of sex. {\an1}But aside from a school board election here {\an1}and a municipal election there, {\an1}the ballot remained elusive. {\an8}♪ {\an7}Most people thoughtthat women's demand for the vote {\an7}was something of a joke back in the 19th century. It was so, seemed so far-fetched. WEISS: Women were considered too emotional, {\an1}not intelligent enough. {\an1}They were supposed to be in the domestic sphere. So the first job of the suffragists {\an1}was really to completely change attitudes {\an1}of millions of Americans {\an1}and convince very reluctant men that this is an important idea. {\an1}Because only men could decidewhether women deserved the vote. {\an1} ♪ NARRATOR: Even after the two factions joined forces in 1890, {\an1}under the umbrella {\an1}of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, {\an1}the only place the cause gained any real traction {\an1}was in the newer states of the West, {\an1}where population was sparse {\an1}and women's votes were regarded as an asset. {\an1}The first state in what came to be known {\an1}as "the suffrage column" was Wyoming, which joined the Union in 1890 {\an1}with its women already fully enfranchised. It was followed over the next six years {\an1}by three more Western states. {\an1}Then, the forward march stalled. KEYSSAR: By the late 19th century, {\an1}in white middle-class and upper-class American society, {\an1}there was a shrinking faith in democracy. In the North, a lot of people are saying, {\an1}"Well, you know, democracy's not an unalloyed blessing. {\an1}"We have all of these immigrants coming in. {\an1}"They don't speak English. {\an1}"They're not very smart. I don't think we should let them vote." {\an1}In the South, of course, the politicians were busy disenfranchising African Americans {\an1}who had been enfranchised during Reconstruction. DUBOIS: The 15th Amendment {\an7}didn't say people have the right to vote {\an7}regardless of race, color, orprevious condition of servitude. {\an7}It said states can't deny people the right to vote. {\an7}Southern states realized, {\an7}well, they wouldn't deny the right to vote by race. {\an7}They'd deny it if your grandfather was a slave. {\an7}That's not specified in the 15th Amendment. {\an8}KEYSSAR: So the dominant movement is to take voting rights {\an7}away from people. {\an7}And that is something which the women's suffrage movement {\an8}runs up against at the end of the century. ♪ NARRATOR:As states across the South moved to bar black men from voting {\an1}by means of grandfather clauses, literacy tests, {\an1}poll taxes, and brute force, {\an1}the National Association,with Susan B. Anthony's assent, {\an1}adapted to the prevailing mood. {\an1}African American women who had been prominent in the movement were sidelined, and Southern chapters permitted to refuse black members. In 1894, Anthony even went so far {\an1}as to ask Frederick Douglass to keep away {\an1}from a suffrage convention in Atlanta {\an1}for fear of alienating potential supporters. GIDDINGS: Frederick Douglass is the onewho stands up and says to women who are ambivalent about calling for the vote, {\an1}"Well, you must work for suffrage." {\an8}So to say to him {\an7}that he's not welcome in the South, in Atlanta, {\an7}is a, is a terrible thing. {\an1}And Anthony probably actually believed that, as she said, {\an1}"When we get the vote, when white women get the vote, {\an1}we'll make everything okay for everybody." {\an1}But it certainly encouraged {\an1}the continuing segregation and discrimination. {\an8}JONES: African American women are going to continue {\an7}to work toward women's rights. {\an7}They're interested in the vote. {\an1}But they are also using those ideas {\an1}to transform and control their institutions in churches, {\an1}in fraternal orders, in benevolent societies. {\an1}They're going to build, by the 1890s, {\an1}an African American women's club movement. And within that, they are also going to be {\an1}claiming women's rights in their own terms. CHATELAIN: These are sisters who are divided because of racism and because of white supremacy, {\an1}and they're asking each other {\an1}to concede on the issue of rights. {\an1}And it will impact {\an7}every single attempt to bring women broadly together {\an7}in action for a better society. NARRATOR: By the close of the 19th century, {\an1}the National Association was comprised mainly {\an1}of white middle-class women, {\an1}but was no more effective for being so. ♪ {\an1}Between 1896 and 1909, {\an1}suffragists across the country submitted {\an1}more than 160 legislative measures for consideration, {\an1}yet managed to put the question of woman suffrage {\an1}directly to voters only six times, {\an1}four of them in Oregon. {\an1}All six referenda were defeated. {\an1}The federal amendment, likewise, went nowhere. {\an1}Suffragists referred to the period {\an1}as "the doldrums." {\an1}Even Susan B. Anthony could not escape {\an1}the pervasive sense of impotence. {\an1}As she lamented in 1906, {\an1}four years after Stanton's death and just weeks before her own, {\an1}"I have struggled for 60 years for a little bit of justice and will die without securing it." ♪ SMEAL: At the beginning, {\an1}women were not supposed to be interested in public affairs. {\an1}We were supposed to know nothing about what's outside the home. {\an1}We were only supposed to know what was in the home. {\an1}You were supposed to have many children. {\an7}You weren't supposed to complain. {\an8}(chuckles): Make everything look easy. You know, they'd all eat together, and then the men would go into the library or some other part of the house {\an1}to talk about the real things of society. {\an1}You didn't want to bother {\an1}the pretty little woman's head, right? {\an1}You know what I compare it to? I compare it to when you're little kids {\an1}and you're building a tree house. {\an1}And they put up a sign, "No girls allowed." ♪ NARRATOR: On election day in 1909, in New York City, {\an1}a 53-year-old suffragist named Harriot Stanton Blatch {\an1}defied convention by daring to enter a polling place {\an1}on the Upper West Side. {\an1}Having researched state law and found {\an1}that it did not prohibit non-voters {\an1}from serving as poll watchers, {\an1}she'd gotten herself credentialed. {\an1}By day's end, she'd seen to it that two drunken election officials were forcibly removed by police. {\an1}Elsewhere in the city, {\an1}on the Lower East Side and in the Bowery, {\an1}other women were following Blatch's lead. (men clamoring) DUBOIS:The polls are in tobacco shops. They're in saloons. {\an1}They're in places where men are very comfortable, {\an1}where they carouse, where their political bosses {\an1}can lubricate them with a drink here and there. WALDMAN: It was a big party, it was raucous, it was drunk, it was often violent. Turnout among men was very high. {\an1}It was like a festival and a spectator sport all at once. {\an7}And well-bred women showing up in that environment {\an7}would not have been a very welcome sight. {\an1}(trolley bell ringing) NARRATOR: To New Yorkers, {\an1}Blatch's coordinated invasion of the polls {\an1}offered a preview of what election day might be {\an1}should women get the vote, {\an1}and, as Blatch noted, {\an1}the expected calamity had not come to pass. {\an1}"We have lifted the veil," she crowed. "We have entered the Holy of Holies, {\an1}and yet the republic is still going on." ♪ DUBOIS: I call Harriot Stanton Blatch {\an1}the first second-generation feminist. {\an1}She was a member of one of the first classes at Vassar. {\an1}She had lived in England and was friends with the Pankhursts. {\an1}And then she had the confidence and the legitimacy of being Elizabeth Stanton's daughter. {\an1}She realized that whereas, when her mother {\an1}had first pressed for the right to vote, {\an1}women were largely domestic creatures. {\an1}Now, a half-century later, {\an1}women had really moved into the public arena. ♪ NARRATOR: Amid the staggeringtransformation of American life in the 19th century-- {\an1}from rural to urban, {\an1}agricultural to industrial, {\an1}enslaved to free-- {\an1}the cause of women's rights gradually had advanced, {\an1}improving their legal status, expanding their opportunities, {\an1}and allowing many to slip the bonds {\an1}of the domestic sphere. {\an1}By 1900, fully one-fifth of the paid labor force was female, {\an1}with millions of women-- many ofthem immigrants and unmarried-- {\an1}working for wages in factories, textile mills, shops. Thousands more were off to college. {\an1}Diplomas in hand, they delayed marriage and motherhood {\an1}in ever greater numbers, {\an1}to pursue a profession {\an1}or to join one of the countless progressive reform movements {\an1}that were remaking American society. {\an1}So ubiquitous were they in the cities, {\an1}with their streamlined, corset-free style of dress, {\an1}their modern ideas and ambitions, {\an1}they had given rise to a kind of icon known as "the New Woman." ♪ WARE: The New Woman is young, she's in her 20s, {\an1}she's had some college. She can move, partly because she's not wearing so many clothes. {\an1}And there's just a kind of spirit to her of curiosity and embracing the future. {\an1}She sees possibilities for herself {\an1}that her mother never had. NARRATOR: The fresh terrain was nevertheless {\an1}littered with obstacles: {\an1}fields that remained stubbornly closed to women, {\an1}especially African Americans; {\an1}hazardous working conditions and unequal pay; {\an1}male bosses and colleagues {\an1}who were by turns dismissive, hostile, and predatory. {\an1}For women who worked outside the home, {\an1}the vote now was essential. {\an8}♪ CHATELAIN: Women at the dawn of the 20th century were impatient {\an1}for the change that they were realizing in their own lives. Women are able to circulate ideas. {\an1}They're meeting in clubs. They're getting more opportunities {\an1}for formal education, {\an1}and they're seeing themselves as fully-formed adults, as citizens. DUBOIS: The fact that women lacked the right to vote {\an1}in the 20th century {\an1}was a totally antiquated phenomenon. {\an1}And Harriot Stanton Blatchwas determined to resolve that. {\an1}Her vision is to bring working-class women {\an1}into the suffrage movement {\an1}and to link them to middle-class professional women. {\an1}So she puts these two groups of people together {\an1}in an organization that she calls {\an1}the Equality League of Self-Supporting Women. {\an1}Blatch sees this organization as a way to seize control of the New York movement, which had become quite paralyzed, {\an1}and to move it forward. NARRATOR: The Equality League was open to any woman {\an1}who earned her daily bread, Blatch said, "From a cook to a mining engineer, {\an1}and we have both of them." {\an1}Affluent, married,her one daughter already grown, {\an1}Blatch had never had to earn her own living. {\an1}She was, she joked, the only "parasite" {\an1}in the Equality League. But she believed wage-earning women {\an1}were the key to finally winning the ballot. ♪ WARE:You start to get a broader range of activists {\an1}involved in the movement. {\an1}And they know how to go out onstrike, they know how to picket. {\an1} And there's that willingness {\an1}to be confrontational in order to win one's goals {\an1}that then they bring to the suffrage movement. NARRATOR: It was a lesson learned from the Pankhursts. As Blatch told The New York World, the question of votes for women had to be pushed {\an1}out of the parlor and into the streets. {\an1}BLATCH (dramatized): We have ceased to put much energy into discussing the pros and cons of democracy {\an1}with doubting women in the chimney corners, {\an1}and have instead gone out on the street corner {\an1}to appeal to men-- to the voters. ♪ NARRATOR: Every hour spent perched atop a soapbox, {\an1}being heckled by crowds and sometimes pelted with stones, {\an1}heightened the movement's visibility {\an1}and helped to broaden its base of support. Before long, an auxiliary organization {\an1}called Men's League for Women Suffrage had been formed, alliances with African American women-- {\an1}members of the Equal Suffrage League of Brooklyn-- broached, and high-society women persuaded to lend not only their checkbooks, {\an1}but also their considerable influence. {\an1}By the fall of 1909, {\an1}the cause had become actually fashionable, {\an1}and when Blatch brought her friend Emmeline Pankhurst {\an1}to the U.S. for a lecture tour, {\an1}the throngs at Carnegie Hall were such {\an1}that more than a thousand people had to be turned away. {\an1}"Mrs. Blatch's whole idea,"one of her campaigners recalled, {\an1}"was that you must keep suffrage every minute before the public {\an1}"so that they're used to the idea and talk about it, {\an1}"whether they agree or disagree. {\an1}I think she was quite right." ♪ KEYSSAR:There was very little experience with women {\an1}participating actively in political life. {\an7}And nobody quite knew what it would look like, {\an7}and that also made it possiblefor, for people-- meaning men-- {\an1}to project their anxieties about it, you know, onto this. {\an1}What would happen? ♪ {\an8}There's a notion that if women were permitted {\an7}to participate in elections, {\an7}it would destroy the family. {\an1}They genuinely fear that familial relations {\an1}would be disturbed and interrupted, {\an1}that women would be sullied by participating {\an7}in the rough and tough arena of politics. {\an7}There was a fear of the unknown. WARE: It's not just about casting a ballot. {\an1}It is this window on how people feel {\an7}about what women's roles should be in public life. {\an7}And if you look at the cartoons which show women {\an1}just looking like the devil, and with hooves, {\an1}and smoke coming out of their ears... {\an1}They were demonized. {\an1}(crowd murmuring in background) NARRATOR: While the militantMrs. Pankhurst stirred up crowds {\an1}all along the eastern seaboard in the fall of 1909, {\an1}journalist Richard Barry was in New York, {\an1}marinating in the question of votes for women. {\an1}Having noted the sudden, unexpected flurry of activity in the state's suffrage movement, {\an1}the highbrow monthly "Pearson's Magazine" {\an1}had commissioned Barry to conduct a major investigation. So far, he'd dutifully attended one of Pankhurst's lectures, {\an7}interviewed to his mind {\an8}the bombastic Harriot Stanton Blatch, {\an7}and endured more street-corner speeches than he'd cared to. {\an1}The angle he was following now promised to be more congenial: {\an1}women who were opposed to woman suffrage. ♪ {\an1}Respectable, upstanding women, {\an1}such as Mrs. Grover Cleveland, {\an1}former first lady of the United States, who agreed that men and women's roles, {\an1}as her husband once put it, {\an1}"had been assigned long ago by a higher intelligence." {\an1}And Mrs. Gilbert Jones, {\an1}daughter-in-law of the founder of "The New York Times," {\an1}who acknowledged that there'd been much progress for women {\an1}over the previous 50 years, {\an1}but hastened to point out {\an1}that all of it had been achieved without the ballot. {\an1}And Mrs. Nathan Meyer, champion of women's education {\an1}and founder of Barnard College, {\an1}who saw no reason for the female of the species to vote, {\an1}and highly doubted such a vote would make any difference. {\an1}So vehement was Meyer on the point {\an1}that she'd stopped speaking {\an1}to her sister Maud,an ardent and active suffragist, {\an1} almost entirely. WEISS: These are women who truly believe {\an1}that women should not have the vote. {\an1}Some are social conservatives who are educated themselves, {\an1}but really feel that this is a change in the social order {\an1}which is not healthy. {\an1}Some are religious conservatives who believe {\an1}that woman's suffrage goes against the will of God. WARE: Very often, the anti-suffrage women were arguing {\an1}from a position of real class and racial privilege, {\an1}and the vote was not something that they felt was important. SUSAN GOODIER: They're protected in a world where they could {\an1}knock on the door of the judge or the legislator {\an7}and say, "Now, dear, I would like such-and-such." {\an1}They might be able to get it. {\an1}So this indirect influence, {\an1}and this is often one of the terms you'll actually hear, {\an1}"Indirect influence serves us well. {\an1}We don't need the vote." NARRATOR: According to Barry's lengthy report, there were perhaps as many womenorganized against woman suffrage {\an1}as there were women organized in favor of it, {\an1}meaning legislators routinely were treated {\an1}to the "remarkable spectacle," "Pearson's" editor noted, {\an1}"of two groups of women each begging them {\an1}to refuse the prayer of the other." {\an1}Where the vast majority of American women {\an1}stood on the matter was anyone's guess. {\an7}But Barry believed most agreed {\an7}with the impeccable logic of Mrs. Selden Bacon. {\an7}"A woman can no more do a man's work," she'd told him, {\an1}"than a man can do a woman's." GOODIER: Anti-suffragists believed {\an1}they were protecting women. {\an1}That their power came from something other than the vote. {\an1}And that women would lose something {\an1}in this sordid world of politics. (waves crashing, seagulls squawking) {\an1}(ship horn blowing) NARRATOR: In January 1910, {\an1}Alice Paul bid farewell to her fellow suffragettes and to England, {\an1}and set sail for home. When she'd left the United States {\an1}two-and-a-half years earlier, she'd been unknown-- {\an1}an ordinary American girl, albeit plucky and privileged enough {\an1}to indulge her curiosity about the world. {\an1}But thanks to her time with the Pankhursts, {\an1}she was returning a minor celebrity. {\an1}The first news story hadappeared the previous November, {\an7}in a widely reprinted itemlifted from the national wires. {\an1}Miss Alice Paul, identified as an "earnest young woman" {\an1}from Moorestown, New Jersey, {\an1}a Swarthmore graduate, {\an1}and a "very valued member" of the Pankhurst organization, {\an1}had been sentenced to a month {\an1}in London's infamous Holloway Jail. {\an1}"Reliable reports,""The Fort Wayne News" remarked, {\an1}"are to the effect that she will "have to suspend her Christmas stocking {\an1}from a steel slat in a six-by-four cell." {\an1}It was Paul's third time behind bars. {\an1}(glass shattering) {\an1}Like her fellow suffragettes, {\an1}and as per the Pankhursts' evolving strategy, {\an1}she'd broken every pane of glass in her cell {\an1}and declared herself a political prisoner. WALTON: When they were arrested, they wanted to be treated like men. {\an7}Men advocating for political causes had certain rights {\an1}because they were designated political prisoners. {\an1}They could receive mail. {\an1}They could read newspapers. {\an1}They could write letters. {\an1}The women were turned down, and to protest this, {\an1}they just refused to eat. ♪ ZAHNISER: No one wanted to have a woman die in jail {\an1}because she had gone on a hunger strike. {\an1}And the image of women wasting away for want of a basic right was something that the Pankhursts realized was a good idea, first of all, to get their protesters {\an1}out of jail more quickly, {\an1}but also, this was a way to get more media attention. NARRATOR: Contrary to expectation, however, Alice Paul and the other hunger-strikers {\an1}were not released. {\an1}Instead, British authorities force-fed them. CASSIDY: Force-feeding is horrific. {\an1}They would stick a rubber or glass tube {\an1}down the woman's throat or up through her nose, {\an1}and then they would take a funnel {\an1}and pour a mixture of eggs and milk through the funnel {\an1}into the tube and down into her digestive tract. NARRATOR: Paul withstood the ordeal twice daily for the duration of her prison term, {\an1}some 55 times in all. {\an1}"One feels," she wrote to her mother, {\an1}"as though one were an animal about to be vivisected." {\an1}PAUL (dramatized): While the tube is going through the nasal passage, {\an1}it is exceedingly painful, and only less so as it is being withdrawn. I never went through it withoutthe tears streaming down my face and often moaned from beginning to end, {\an1}and sometimes cried aloud. CASSIDY: The only way you can endure something like that is to believe that you're right, {\an1}and that you're doing it for a cause bigger than yourself. {\an1}And Alice Paul really believed in what she was doing. NARRATOR: When reports that Paul was being force-fed {\an1}reached the United States, {\an1}they provoked an outcry-- not sympathy, but condemnation {\an1}of the suffragettes' wanton disregard for the law. CASSIDY: Americans felt a little superior. {\an1}"Well, thank goodness, our suffragists {\an1}aren't behaving like that." DUBOIS: The assumption was that it wasn't going to be necessary {\an1}in the United States. {\an1}The poor British, they had a backward government {\an1}that was bullying them, {\an1}and they had to press to give them equal rights. {\an7}But that wasn't true of democratic America {\an7}in the Progressive era. {\an8}Women wouldn't have to go that far. {\an1}(ship horns blowing) NARRATOR: By the time Paul's ship docked in Philadelphia, {\an1}her notoriety was such that a swarm of reporters {\an1}showed up to greet her. {\an1}"Will you take part in the movement here?" one asked her. {\an1}"I didn't know there was any movement here," {\an1}Paul replied disingenuously. {\an1}"But if it becomes necessary to fight to win, {\an1}I believe in fighting." CASSIDY: Alice Paul came back from England {\an1}knowing that this was going to be her life's cause. {\an7}There was nothing that she thought she couldn't do. ♪ NARRATOR: When the suffrage movement finally scored a victory {\an1}in November 1910-- the first in 14 years-- {\an1}it caught most everyone by surprise. {\an1}Four states held referenda {\an1}on woman suffrage that fall. {\an1}In three, the measures failed by wide margins. {\an1}Voters in Washington state, meanwhile, approved theirs by nearly two-to-one. {\an8}♪ {\an8}WARE: The Washington victory was important. {\an7}It was very important,because it had been a long time. {\an1}All of a sudden, it begins to seem possible. {\an1}There's almost a sense of, "Oh, gee, {\an1}this really can happen." NARRATOR: By now, some 100,000 women were dues-paying members {\an1}of the National Association, {\an1}up from just 9,000 a decade before. {\an1}Tens of thousands more belonged to the pro-suffrage {\an1}National Association of Colored Women, {\an1}to local Equality Leagues, Franchise Associations, {\an1}and Votes for Women clubs. {\an1}Winning the ballot in Washington state {\an1}renewed their collective hope, {\an1}reinforced their sense of purpose, and propelled the boldest among them {\an1}into the streets of America. WEISS: There's this real pent-up frustration. {\an1}And they're saying, {\an7}"Look, we've pleaded long enough. {\an7}"We've been patient long enough, this is ridiculous, {\an1}and let's go make a scene." ♪ NARRATOR: The next year, in California, they turned out in force, {\an1}an estimated 10,000 strong, {\an1}to sell woman suffrageto the male voters of the state. {\an1}With just three months until the election, they feverishly plastered posters in shop windows and on billboards, {\an1}peddled suffrage buttons and suffrage tea, {\an1}and distributed more than three million pieces of literature. {\an1}In Los Angeles, Hispanicactivists translated at rallies. {\an1}San Francisco's Chinese women canvassed their communities, {\an1}while in Oakland, members of the Colored Women's Suffrage Club {\an1}monitored polling places. {\an1}By the time their efforts delivered California, {\an1}the sixth so-called free state, {\an1}to the cause in 1911, {\an1}votes for women had become, as one journalist observed, {\an1}"the three small words which constitute {\an1}the biggest question in the world today." WARE: There is a kind of quickening that starts to happen. {\an1}There are new tactics and there are new strategies {\an1}and there are new recruits, {\an1}and things really just begin to, to pop. NARRATOR: Week by week, all across the country, {\an1}in New York, Connecticut, {\an1}Massachusetts, and Maine, {\an1}Michigan, Wisconsin, Kansas, Arizona, {\an1}suffragists pressed to make the next free state their own. {\an1}And week by week, all across the country, {\an1}women flocked to the cause. ♪ WARE: Women started doing things like dressing in white and putting on a suffrage sash, {\an1}and marching in a parade. {\an1}It's not like you just sort of check off a box and say, {\an1}"I'm a suffragist now." {\an1}It affects a lot of things. {\an1}If you're married, it's going to affect your marriage, {\an1}because all of a sudden, your husband has a wife {\an1}who may not be there at the end of the day to cook his dinner. {\an1}And she may be heading off to a rally {\an1}or standing on a street corner handing out leaflets. And he may think this is a great thing, {\an1}or he may think it's awful, but he's part of that conversation. {\an1}And if you're someone who really goes all in, {\an1}it basically becomes a job. {\an1}These are real people, andthey're making this their lives, {\an1}and there's this kind of snowball effect {\an1}that is happening. NARRATOR: As the summer of 1912 was winding down, 58-year-old Harriet Taylor Upton was gearing up for a special election in Ohio-- {\an1}a state referendum on woman suffrage, {\an1}the first of six to be held in the U.S. that fall. {\an1}Never in Upton's 20 years in the movement {\an1}had there been such a chance for progress, {\an1}and as the president {\an1}of the Ohio Woman Suffrage Association, {\an1}she intended her home state to lead the charge. ♪ {\an1}Already, she'd put 50 campaign volunteers in the field, {\an1}as well as a roster of popular speakers, {\an1}and had tasked them with canvassing voters {\an1}at picnics, county fairs, family reunions. {\an1}State politicians and the local press {\an7}generally agreed the suffrage measure, Amendment 23, {\an7}was likely to carry, {\an1}perhaps by as many as 40,000 votes. {\an1}Then, copies of an anonymous and alarming handbill {\an1}began to circulate, suggesting that,if women were permitted to vote, Ohio would join the growing list of states that had shuttered their saloons {\an1}and deprived their citizens of beer. {\an8}It was a charge {\an7}that had dogged the suffrage movement for decades, {\an7}not least because it rang true. ♪ SMEAL: I don't think that many people realize {\an1}that Susan B. Anthony was a leader {\an1}in the temperance movement. {\an7}The temperance movement {\an7}was all about men's behavior, by the way. {\an7}It was not just alcohol, it was the abuse of alcohol {\an1}and the beating of women by drunken men. {\an1}They would also spend {\an1}an inordinate amount of money on it, and on pay day, they'd go to the bars, {\an1}and what would be left for the wife and the kids? {\an7}So there was a whole movement to restrict alcohol. NARRATOR: Perhaps nowhere was the link {\an1}between temperance and woman suffrage {\an1}more established than in Ohio, {\an1}the birthplace of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. {\an1}The largest women's organization in the country, {\an7}the WCTU had led the crusade to ban alcohol {\an7}since the late 19th century, {\an7}and endorsed votes for women {\an8}as a "weapon for home protection." WALTON:This activated the liquor lobby. {\an1}These are the distilleries, the breweries, {\an1}the farmers who grow crops for alcohol, alcoholic products, cask makers. It's huge. {\an1}So whenever a vote came up in a state for suffrage, the liquor lobby poured money in to defeat it. ♪ WEISS: They would do things like, {\an1}a bar would have a sign up on election day and say, "Vote against the women's suffrage amendment {\an1}and you get a free beer." They don't want national prohibition, and if women had some political power, that might happen. NARRATOR: Aware that the association with temperance {\an1}had become a liability, {\an1}Harriet Taylor Upton had done her best {\an1}to create some distance. "Let me explain that the suffrage association {\an1}is not a temperance organization," {\an1}she'd insisted in an official statement that summer. {\an1}But in a state where brewing was a major industry, {\an1}such reassurances struck many voters {\an1}as too little, too late. {\an1}On September 3, 1912, Ohio Amendment number 23 lost, with nearly 58% of the electorate {\an1}voting against it. ♪ {\an1}Two days later, the womansuffrage referendum in Wisconsin {\an1}failed in precisely the same manner, {\an1}as did the one in Michigan in November. KEYSSAR: As women link suffrage rights to social reform, {\an1}whether it means for women who are working {\an1}in the garment industry {\an1}or the temperance movement to ban alcohol, {\an7}major economic interests {\an7}who are tied to industries that are profiting from this {\an8}begin to oppose women's suffrage. WARE: There's money involved, there's power involved, and women are threatening them. {\an1}And a lot of people really didn't want things to change. ♪ NARRATOR: By the close of 1912, the map told the tale. {\an1}Against three victories for woman suffrage that fall {\an1}were the three defeats at the hands of the liquor industry. {\an1}After 64 years of struggle, {\an1}women were still without full voting rights in 39 states, {\an1}and outside of the West lay entrenched resistance. {\an1}To the east, economic concerns and political machines {\an1}blocked the progress of the cause. To the south, it was the scourge of racism. ♪ JONES:The rise of white supremacy andthe imposition of Jim Crow order has created a political terrain in which white men control political power. {\an1}So to introduce womenis to reintroduce this question of the suffrage, of its universality, {\an1}of its core relationship to a democracy. {\an7}And that gets you a little too close, then, {\an8}to the problem {\an7}of African Americans and the vote, as well. KEYSSAR: The fear was that it would reopen demands {\an1}on the part of black males to vote, {\an1}and there was a further concern, too, {\an1}which was often voiced-- {\an1}it was quite a remarkable statement-- {\an1}which was that, "If men try to vote and get unruly, {\an1}"we can go in and beat them up. {\an1}"We can use force against them. {\an1}"That would be unseemly to do against black women. {\an1}"So we really don't want to permit them to be enfranchised {\an1}and then have to figure out new modes of repression." ♪ NARRATOR: When the women of the National Association convened in Philadelphia late in November, {\an1}the suffrage map was hanging across the balcony {\an1}at the back of Witherspoon Hall, {\an1}a nod to the movement's progress, however halting. But to Alice Paul, who was among the delegates from New Jersey, {\an1}it read more as an indictment. WALTON: She saw how difficult it was to get a change {\an1}in a state voting law. {\an8}First of all, the state legislature {\an7}had to approve it-- all men. {\an1}Then it had to go to the voters-- all men. {\an1}And she thought it would be much easier and much faster {\an1}to have a federal amendment {\an1}which would give all women in this country the vote. NARRATOR: Although Paul had been given permission {\an1}to raise the issue at the convention, {\an1}she expected to meet with resistance {\an1}from the National Association's leadership, not least from president Anna Howard Shaw, who had let the federal suffrage amendment languish {\an1}throughout the eight years of her tenure. ♪ {\an7}An ordained minister, Shaw had been the only woman {\an7}in a class of 43 at the Boston School of Theology, {\an7}and had felt, as she later said, "the abysmal conviction {\an7}that I wasn't really wanted there." {\an1}After completing her education in 1886, at the age of 39, she'd joined the suffrage movement. {\an1}Alice Paul had only just been born. BETH BEHN: Alice Paul is not of the generation that understands {\an1}the impact of Reconstruction, that understands the deep racial divides {\an1}that are foremost in the minds of older suffragists. {\an7}So it's not a coincidence {\an7}that the National walks away from a federal amendment at the same time that Southern states are pushing back on any federal intervention into who's voting in the South, {\an1}and, in fact, drawing a very hard state-rights' stance. {\an1}So the National is cognizant of that-- in some ways, complicit in that-- {\an1}and decides to focus on state referenda. NARRATOR: Paul was convinced the landscape had changed. {\an1}With more than a million female voters in the West, {\an1}woman suffrage had become for the first time {\an1}a factor in national politics. In the recent presidential election, {\an1}candidate Theodore Roosevelt's insurgent Progressive Party {\an1}had even adopted a plank endorsing votes for women. {\an1}"Now was the moment to revive the push {\an1}for the federal amendment," {\an1}Paul told the women of the National Association, {\an1}"and to do so in a way that could not be ignored." {\an1}(people talking in background, drum beating) ZAHNISER: Alice was thinking {\an1}about staging a parade along the lines {\an1}of the spectacular parades {\an1}that the Pankhursts had in London. {\an1}And she wanted to bring one of those to Washington, DC, {\an1}the premier focus of power in the United States. WALTON: As it happened,there had been suffrage parades, three in a row, {\an1}organized by Harriot Stanton Blatch in New York. {\an1}(crowd talking in background, drum beating) {\an1}And Anna Howard Shaw had marched in those parades. {\an1}And it turned out thatAnna Howard Shaw loved a parade, {\an1} and she liked this idea. ♪ NARRATOR: By the time the convention delegates {\an1}began boarding trains {\an1}back to their respective dots on the map, {\an1}Alice Paul had been named chairman {\an1}of the National Association's long-dormant Congressional Committee {\an1}in Washington, D.C., and given leave to plan her parade. To maximize the event's impact, {\an1}she intended to hold it on March 3, {\an1}the day before President-elect Woodrow Wilson's inauguration. ♪ CASSIDY: Press from across America was going to be there {\an1}and there were going to be lots of spectators there. {\an1}So it was a captive audience, and she knew that it would be {\an1}a really powerful message to all of America. ♪ NARRATOR: It was now November 27, just 13 weeks before inauguration day. Paul rushed home and started packing her bags. ♪ ZAHNISER: We think these days {\an1}that national protests in Washington are routine, {\an1}but they were almost non-existent in 1913. ♪ {\an1}There had been one previous protest, in 1894, {\an1}when Jacob Coxey brought veterans of the Civil War to Washington {\an1}to protest their lack of pension payments. {\an8}They marched across the Capitol grounds {\an7}and were promptly arrested, {\an7}and that was the end of the protest. ♪ NARRATOR: As the curtain opened on 1913, the nucleus of the woman suffrage movement {\an1}already had begun to shift to the nation's capital, {\an1}where the Congressional Committee's new office on F Street soon buzzed with so much activity {\an1}that one reporter dubbed it a "suffragists' beehive." ♪ {\an1}Alice Paul had arrived in town in early December {\an1}with her friend and co-chairman, Lucy Burns, a fellow veteran of the Pankhurst army. {\an1}Brooklyn-born to a close-knit Irish Catholic family, Burns, at 33, was Paul's opposite {\an1}in nearly every respect-- exuberant, outgoing, {\an1}easy with a laugh. {\an1}To her would fall the task of recruiting volunteers {\an1}and rousing crowds on street corners. {\an1}Paul, meanwhile, spent most of her time at the office, {\an1}in a chilly back room behind a desk {\an1}that once belonged to Susan B. Anthony. ZAHNISER: Alice Paul was much more comfortable {\an1}as the stage manager, as the director, {\an1}than she was as the star. She nevertheless had an emotional intensity that seemed to encourage people to follow her. NARRATOR: With a single-mindedness that bordered on mania, {\an1}Paul wrangled a permit to stage the parade {\an1}on Pennsylvania Avenue, {\an1}the symbolic conduit of American political power. {\an1}She prevailed upon suffrage leaders everywhere {\an1}to loan their floats, banners, chariots, {\an1}and oversaw a revolving staff of volunteers-- {\an1}as many as 20 a day-- {\an1}who solicited donations, arranged lodging for out-of-town marchers, {\an1}and kept up a steady drumbeat of anticipation in the press. ♪ ZAHNISER: We're beginning to see really a golden age of magazines and illustrations, {\an1}newspapers beginning to use more photographs. {\an1}And Alice Paul recognized that this {\an1}represented something that she could use. ♪ WALTON: There was news every day about some new person {\an1}who was joining the parade. {\an1}And her headquarters became a mandatory stop for reporters {\an1}on a daily basis. {\an1}"What's new, Alice? {\an1}"What's happening? {\an1}What do you have to tell us?" {\an1}Alice's goal was to have suffrage in the papers every day, {\an1}18 inches in front of the reading public. ♪ NARRATOR:In February, Chicago journalist Ida Wells-Barnett-- {\an1}better known by her maiden name, Ida B. Wells-- {\an1}decided she would be amongthe marchers in Washington, DC. {\an1} Born into slavery {\an1}just months before the Emancipation Proclamation, {\an1}Wells, at 50, had dedicated much of her adult life {\an1}to exposing racial injustice in the South, {\an1}where the disenfranchisement of African American men {\an1}had been accompanied by shocking brutality. DUBOIS: The country had gone through the most radical of changes. {\an1}It had taken a group of people who were considered subhuman {\an1}and made them into the equals of proud, white men. {\an7}And the political class, the elite, {\an7}reacted violently to that. ♪ NARRATOR: In 1892 alone, well over a hundred African Americans {\an1}had been lynched, among them one of Wells' closest friends, a doting father and the co-owner {\an1}of a thriving grocery cooperative in Memphis. JONES: Wells confesses that she had always assumed {\an1}that the victims of lynching had somehow done a wrong, {\an1}even if it wasn't the wrong they had been accused of. {\an1}But when her friends, {\an1}men who were known to her to be, in her judgment, {\an1}sort of beyond reproach, are lynched, she's converted. She's converted. {\an1}She understands now, right, {\an1}that there is somethingessentially illegitimate, right, {\an1}that undergirds racial violence. GIDDINGS: She sees that something else is happening. {\an1}And she's really the first to understand it {\an1}in a kind of comprehensive way. {\an1}Blacks were progressing so quickly {\an7}that they were threatening. ♪ NARRATOR: Having been deprived of the ballot, Wells told her readers in 1910, {\an1}African Americans had been robbed {\an1}of their only weapon of defense. {\an1}WELLS (dramatized): With no sacredness of the ballot, {\an1}there can be no sacredness of human life itself. {\an1}For if the strong can take the weak man's ballot {\an1}when it suits his purpose to do so, {\an1}he will take his life, also. {\an1}Therefore, the more complete the disenfranchisement, {\an1}the more frequent and horrible {\an1}has been the hangings, shootings, and burnings. ♪ WARE: African American women had seen what it meant {\an1}to have African American men disfranchised in the South, and they realize it's very important {\an1}for women to have the vote. {\an1}They see it as part of a larger struggle for racial justice. JONES: If you can't vote, you can't sit on a jury. {\an1}If you can't sit on a jury,you can't determine what happens {\an1} in a local courthouse {\an1}when the perpetrators of lynching {\an1}are brought before a court. {\an1}If you can't vote, you can't be appointed a judge {\an1}and sit on the bench and preside {\an1}when the perpetrators of lynching {\an1}are brought before a court. {\an1}These are the mechanics, right? {\an1}And Wells knows the mechanics of how Southern courts-- {\an1}how all courts in the nation-- work. And so the vote might be sacred, {\an1}but the vote is also, um, a true instrument, right, {\an1}of political power, political access. {\an1}Without access to the polls, {\an1}it's difficult to imagine how black Americans {\an1}are going to turn what's happening {\an1}in another direction. NARRATOR: Eager to mobilize African American women, {\an1}Wells recently had founded the Alpha Suffrage Club, {\an1}the first black suffrage organization in Chicago, {\an1}and she intended to represent it in Alice Paul's parade. ZAHNISER:Alice Paul had every expectation {\an1}that African American women would march. {\an1}African American women hadmarched in the New York parade. {\an1}She had already reached out to African Americans, encouraging them to think about marching. {\an1}She was quickly disillusioned that that was a good idea when some of the Washington women came to her {\an1}and said that that simply was not acceptable. ♪ WALTON: It's a very Southern city. {\an1}It's a very racist city. These women come to headquarters. They're lifelong Washingtonians, and they know the city. {\an1}And they tell her,"This can destroy your parade." NARRATOR:In a letter, Paul confessed bothher quandary and her conclusion. African Americans would not be excluded from the parade, {\an1}but neither would their participation be encouraged. {\an1}PAUL (dramatized): The prejudice against Negroes is so strong {\an1}in this section of the country {\an1}that I believe a large part, if not a majority, {\an1}of our white marchers {\an1}will refuse to participate if Negroes in any number {\an1}formed a part of the parade. {\an1}That being the case, as far as I can see, {\an1}we must have a white procession, or a Negro procession, {\an1}or no procession at all. {\an1}The best thing is to say nothing whatever about the question, to keep it out of the newspapers, {\an1}to try to make thisa purely suffrage demonstration {\an1}entirely uncomplicated by any other problems, {\an1}such as racial ones. ♪ JONES: Alice Paul understands her choices. {\an1}She understands the stakes in decisions that she makes. And the legacies of those sorts of moments, {\an1}which, in the name of expediency, {\an7}racism is re-imposed and furthered {\an7}rather than challenged. {\an1}And then we have to remember, like, the whole country {\an1}is remarkably troubled, {\an1}and racism is a political fact, {\an1}and it's a political strategy. {\an1}Which doesn't excuse women who use racism, but it's to say, {\an1}why do we expect, silently, perhaps naively, {\an1}why do we expect American women to be distinct from the ideas {\an1}that animate American, white American men {\an1}in the same moment? ♪ SMEAL: Reformers, people who fight for change, are always asked to be perfect. But they're living in a society {\an7}where you make accommodations to go to the next step. {\an7}Maybe you shouldn't, but... {\an1}It's almost impossible to get the whole loaf. ♪ NARRATOR: They called themselves "Pilgrims"-- {\an1}a band of suffragists, clad in brown capes and heavy boots, {\an1}making their way on foot from New York to Washington, D.C.-- {\an1}a distance of some 260 miles-- {\an1}to join the march for the vote in the nation's capital. In the lead was Rosalie Gardiner Jones-- {\an1}also known as General Jones-- {\an1}a 29-year-old Oyster Bay socialite {\an1}who'd traded what she called her "pink tea existence" for a life in the suffrage trenches. {\an7}She'd recently completed a similar trek {\an7}from New York City to Albany, {\an7}not merely to petition thegovernor for the right to vote, {\an7}but also, as she said, "to meet the people along the way {\an7}and talk suffrage to them." {\an1}When they set out on February 12, 1913, the Pilgrims were some 200 strong. ♪ {\an1}By the end of the first day, {\an1}their number had dwindled to a determined 16. ♪ WALTON: It was winter, and they're marching through ice and snow and slush. {\an1}And they have a wagon filled with leaflets. {\an1}And their idea isthey will campaign for suffrage {\an1} along the way, {\an1}and they will hand out these leaflets, {\an1}and they will give talks. {\an1}And they were followed every step of the way by reporters. ♪ NARRATOR: Over the last two weeks of February, {\an1}as the women kept to a pace of up to 20 miles a day, {\an1}crowds continually lined their route. {\an1}Some, mostly men, came to jeer. In Pennsylvania, the hikers were assaulted {\an1}with stones and snowballs. In Delaware, a group of small boys {\an1}released dozens of mice into the Pilgrims' path, {\an1}reportedly provoking hysteria. {\an1}Others, of both sexes, expressed support. {\an1}"These suffragettes arecertainly doing the world good," {\an1} "Hearst's Magazine" enthused. {\an1}"Not only will we fall in line {\an1}"and hike with them for a few miles, {\an1}"but we will in sympathy fall in love {\an1}with the cause they represent." {\an1}Meanwhile, suffragists from all over the country {\an1}were likewise headed for Washington. ♪ {\an1}(whistle blaring) ZAHNISER: If you were a suffragist, youwanted to go to this big event. {\an1}People were commissioning special trains. {\an1}Chicago had a train, including Ida B. Wells, {\an1}that roared into Washington the night before. {\an1}There was an extensive trolley system, {\an7}and some women were actually able to get on the trolley {\an7}in Portland, Maine, {\an7}and transfer on one ticketall the way to Washington, D.C. {\an1}Anybody who could get to Washington in any way possible {\an1}became very interested in marching {\an1}in the first great national parade. ♪ NARRATOR: Alice Paul and Lucy Burns had been expecting {\an1}perhaps 2,500 marchers. {\an1}By the time Jones and her Pilgrims trudged into town, on the afternoon of February 27, {\an1}there were at least twice as many. ♪ Alberta Hill, who'd come from New York, {\an1}summed up their mood: {\an1}"I am looking forward to the parade," she wrote, {\an1}"with as much interest as alittle girl to her first party." {\an1} ♪ WARE: Think about what it would be like to march {\an1}in your first suffrage parade. {\an1}Maybe you had a white dress that you took out of your closet, {\an1}or maybe you wore a special suffrage hat {\an1}and a, and a sash. {\an1}You're not a bystander anymore. {\an1}And even if you felt a little scared and a little nervous, {\an1}or maybe a lot scared and a lot nervous, {\an1}you're surrounded by other women {\an1}who believe in the same thing you do. {\an7}And there must have been just this amazing rush {\an8}of feeling part of something bigger. ♪ NARRATOR: By mid-morning on March 3, 1913, {\an1}the marchers already weregathering on Pennsylvania Avenue {\an1} in droves. ♪ {\an1}"We went out early," Alice Paul recalled, {\an1}"very early, to try to begin to line the people up." {\an1}Anna Howard Shaw, the National Association's president, {\an1}was there in her doctoral robes, {\an1}soaking up the enthusiasm of the crowd. ♪ {\an1}But as the kaleidoscopic mass {\an1}shifted into position for drills, {\an1}a fracas broke out {\an1}among the marchers from Illinois. According to the "Chicago Tribune" reporter {\an1}traveling with them, {\an1}the delegation's chair made a last-minute announcement: {\an1}She'd been advised to keepthe delegation "entirely white," {\an1}she said, "due to the objectionsof Eastern and Southern women." {\an1}Although African Americans were interspersed {\an1}throughout the procession-- {\an1}among them members of a Howard University sorority-- {\an1}it was decided Ida B. Wells {\an1}would have to march with a contingent in the rear. ♪ GIDDINGS: She was nationally famous. {\an1}She had been so much a part of the suffrage organizations, {\an1}longer than most of those women who were there. {\an1}So she is just, becomes very emotional about this, {\an1}not feeling, not in a... a self-pitying way, {\an1}but she understands what would happen {\an1}if it came out that, {\an1}that she was excluded from this group. NARRATOR: Fighting back tears, Wells addressed the 62 women {\an1}of the Illinois delegation. {\an1}WELLS (dramatized): If the Illinois women do not take a stand now {\an1}in this great democratic parade, {\an1}then the colored women are lost. When I was asked to come down here, {\an1}I was asked to march with the other women of our state, {\an1}and either I go with you or not at all. NARRATOR:When the delegation reassembled for the procession, just after 3:00, {\an1}Wells was nowhere to be found. {\an1}(people calling in background) {\an1}By then, Pennsylvania Avenue was jammed with spectators. {\an1}The welcoming party for the president-elect, by contrast, {\an1}was strangely sparse. WALDMAN: Woodrow Wilson steps off the train in Washington, D.C. He's just been elected president of the United States. {\an8}He's expecting a, a huge welcome. {\an1}And there's nobody there. BEHN: And so he asks, "What's going on?" {\an1}And somebody tells him {\an1}most of the people are out watching the suffrage parade. {\an1}And it's this early indicator of the role {\an7}that suffrage is going to play in his term {\an7}as he's about to take office the following day. ♪ NARRATOR: Finally, at 25 past 3:00, a blare of trumpets rang out {\an1}and the procession's two dozenhorse-drawn floats, nine bands, {\an1}four mounted brigades, and thousands of marchers {\an1}stirred into motion. Leading them all was Inez Milholland, {\an1}a 26-year-old attorney the press had dubbed {\an1}"the most beautiful suffragette." ♪ Lest anyone mistake the purpose of the demonstration, {\an1}Alice Paul had displayed it on the very first float, {\an1}the so-called great demand. WALTON: This was very bold. {\an1}Women did not demand in those days. {\an1}And she was putting Wilson on notice {\an1}that the women wanted action. {\an1}Alice also wanted it to be a beautiful parade. {\an1}It was a narrative of women's progress, {\an1}from pioneer days all the way up to present day. {\an1}The present day consisted of phalanxes of women {\an1}marching by profession. {\an1}You had your librarians. {\an1}You had your teachers. {\an1}You had your nurses. The message was, "This is the contribution {\an1}that women make to society." ♪ NARRATOR: For roughly four blocks, {\an1}the parade unspooled along the avenue as planned. {\an1}(people murmuring in background) {\an1}Then, rowdy onlookers began to break {\an1}through the steel cables lining the route. {\an1}(people murmuring in background) WALDMAN: You had 5,000 women marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. {\an1}And surrounding them were 100,000 men, {\an1}many of them drunk. {\an1}And the men began jeering and spitting. WALTON: They spilled into the path of the parade. They hurled taunts at the women. {\an1}They threw lighted cigarettes at them. {\an1}They plucked objects off the floats. WALDMAN: They assaulted the marchers {\an1}and sent a hundred of them to the hospital. WALTON: The police, they weren't much better. {\an1}They turned their back on the parade and they're smirking, {\an1}like this is all some kind of big joke. ZAHNISER: So very quickly, what were marchers marching {\an1}four or even eight abreast {\an1}became a single file {\an1}in a very, very threatening atmosphere. NARRATOR:Only the arrival of the cavalry enabled the marchers {\an1}to complete the route. {\an1}One later compared the experience to being forced through the neck of a funnel. {\an1}"I did not know," another recalled, {\an1}"that men could be such fiends." {\an1}Ida B. Wells took advantage of the chaos, {\an1}boldly stepping in with the Illinois delegation {\an1}midway through the route. {\an1}"Illinois is Lincoln's state," she told a reporter. {\an1}"I don't believe Lincoln's state {\an1}"is going to permit Alabama or Georgia or any other state {\an1}to begin to dictate to it now." ♪ {\an1}Given the punishing afternoon, {\an1}many expected the mood at the post-procession rally to be grim. {\an1}But as one marcher recalled, "To our great surprise, {\an1}the leaders were jubilant!" {\an1}"If anything could prove the need of the ballot," {\an1}Anna Howard Shaw proclaimed, {\an1}"nothing could prove it more {\an1}than the treatment we received today." ♪ ZAHNISER: Alice Paul and the National Association leaders {\an1}realized they had a media sensation on their hands. WALTON: Alice was a public relations genius. {\an7}She saw that this parade {\an7}on the front pages of newspapers across America {\an7}was a better storythan her parade would have been. {\an7}And what was that story? {\an7}Men bad, women good, right? {\an8}It was basic. WALDMAN: This march overshadowed the inauguration of the president of the United States, {\an1}because these non-violent marchers were attacked {\an1}for just trying to fulfill their rights as Americans. ♪ NARRATOR: By the following morning, {\an1}the newspapers were in receipt of an open letter, {\an1}penned in New York by Harriot Stanton Blatch {\an1}and addressed to the soon-to-be- inaugurated president, Woodrow Wilson. {\an1}BLATCH (dramatized): As you ride today in comfort and safety to the Capitol, {\an1}we beg that you will not be unmindful {\an1}that yesterday, the government-- {\an1}which is supposed to exist for the good of all-- {\an1}left women, while passing in peaceful procession in their demand for political freedom, {\an1}at the mercy of a howling mob on the very streets {\an1}which are being at this moment so efficiently officered {\an1}for the protection of men. ♪ DUBOIS: Paul pressed to have a congressional investigation. And this prolonged the publicity {\an1}that the demonstration had gotten. {\an1}So instead of being intimidated by the attack, {\an7}she used it as an argument to get... {\an7}Effectively to get the Congress to begin to move {\an7}on the federal amendment. ♪ WALDMAN: The idea of a constitutional amendment {\an1}guaranteeing the right to vote for women {\an1}was a pipe dream. {\an1}It wasn't on the agenda. {\an1}And then Alice Paul said, "We're going to do this." CASSIDY: It put suffrage on the map in a brand-new way. NARRATOR: The movement's leadership continued to believe {\an1}the vote would be won in the states, {\an1}but a higher profile for the cause could only help in that. {\an1}"The National Association," Anna Howard Shaw told Paul, {\an1}"will never cease to be grateful to you all {\an1}for the splendid service you have done in its name." ♪ ♪ NARRATOR: That spring, {\an1}while the controversy over the parade {\an1}was still splashed across the nation's front pages, {\an1}the Thomas A. Edison Company debuted {\an1}its latest film in New York. {\an1}The nation's movie houses and kinetoscope parlors {\an1}had been awash in films about woman suffrage for years now, {\an1}most of them short comedies about misguided, mannish women {\an1}unsuccessfully experimenting with power. {\an1}Edison's new entry sought {\an1}to turn the popular stereotype on its head. {\an1}Entitled "Votes for Women" and featuring five prominent suffragists, each delivering a 60-second speech, {\an1}the film was part of a series of so-called talkers. For 40 years, these six reasonable plaints have been placed before Parliament... NARRATOR: But no sooner had suffragist number one come into view {\an1}than the talk was drowned out by hisses, hoots, and jeers. {\an1}Newspapers translated the uproar into words. {\an1}"Vaudeville audiences are not bashful {\an1}about expressing opinions," {\an1}observed "The New York Tribune," {\an1}"and it seemed to be the general opinion {\an1}"that those women were not good lookers enough {\an1}to deserve a man's vote." WEISS: It is important to realize how vilified the women were. {\an1}The idea is that, if you are a suffragist, {\an1}there must be something wrong with you. {\an1}You must be a spinster. {\an1}You must be unsexed and somehow psychologically unbalanced. {\an1}You must just want to be a man. (crowd cheering) {\an1}(people talking in background, band playing in distance) NARRATOR: Suffragists had expectedbig things from Woodrow Wilson, {\an1}who'd been elected on the strength {\an1}of his progressive reform platform. {\an1}But throughout his first hundred days as president-- {\an1}and for months beyond-- {\an1}he'd managed to avoid taking any public position {\an1}on the question of votes for women. ♪ BEHN: Woodrow Wilson is a verytraditional Southern gentleman. {\an1}And his political interests and leanings {\an1}mirror his upbringing. {\an1}He's not dismissive of women {\an1}or the role that they have to play in society, {\an1}but he does believe {\an1}that that role is primarily as nurturers, as upholders of morals and values within families, {\an1}and he's deeply concerned {\an1}that allowing women to enter the political realm {\an1}will disrupt the foundation of society. CASSIDY: Woodrow Wilson was against women's suffrage. He never wanted to state that publicly, {\an1}and was always very careful {\an1}when he spoke with deputations of these suffragists {\an1}coming to see him. He would say, "Oh, well, you know, "I understand your perspective, and that's interesting. {\an7}"I have a lot of other things on my plate right now. {\an7}We'll see what happens." ♪ NARRATOR: By the fall of 1913,Alice Paul had long since tired of the presidential dodge. {\an1}When she and Lucy Burns launched "The Suffragist"-- {\an1}a weekly newspaper meant to track the progress {\an1}toward the federal amendment-- they put Wilson on the debut issue's cover, depicting him as a smug obstacle to the cause. {\an1}At home in Pennsylvania, Anna Howard Shaw {\an1}perused the issue with dismay. {\an1}It was bad enough that Paul and Burns {\an1}had published "The Suffragist" {\an1}without consulting the National Association, {\an1}but to see such an unkind portrayal of the president, Shaw told Burns, {\an1}had made her "sick at heart." {\an1}The national suffrage organization {\an1}was very hierarchical. {\an1}The people in charge believed {\an1}that they deserved to be in charge, {\an1}young people must come up through the ranks, {\an1}and Alice Paul was none of that. She could see what needed to be done, {\an1}and she intended to do it. ♪ NARRATOR: Paul had been raising hackles at the National Association for months now, ever since the parade. {\an1}Just weeks afterward, {\an1}she'd personally led a deputation {\an1}to President Wilson, {\an1}who gave the women ten minutes of his time, {\an1}listened politely, {\an1}and then shrugged them off, {\an1}claiming that Congress was too busy {\an1}with tariffs and currency reform {\an1}to consider woman suffrage. ♪ {\an1}"But Mr. President," Paul countered, {\an1}"do you not understand that the administration {\an1}"has no right to legislate {\an1}"for currency, tariff, and any other reform {\an1}without first getting the consent of women?" WARE: It was going to be very hard to get through to Woodrow Wilson, {\an1}no matter what anybody said. But Alice Paul was confrontational. She's impatient, {\an1}and she really sees him as a huge adversary. {\an1}She was trying to make him, as president, {\an1}deal with this issue. NARRATOR: Were such audacity not enough, {\an1}Paul and Burns also had formed a separate organization, {\an1}the Congressional Union, to push for the federal amendment, {\an1}and had even raised their own funds for the endeavor, {\an1}diverting them, in Shaw's view, from the National's coffers. {\an7}But nothing was more troubling {\an7}than Paul and Burns' public embrace {\an7}of Emmeline Pankhurst, who by now had resorted {\an7}to waging what she called"guerrilla warfare" in England. {\an7}(explosion roars, siren blaring) {\an1}(crowd murmuring) ♪ WALTON: Until this point, {\an1}the most violent thing they had done {\an1}was to throw rocks through windows, {\an1}which is kind of a time-honored form of protest in Britain. {\an1}Now they're cuttingelectric lines, telegraph lines. {\an1}They're slashing seats in trains. {\an1}They set fire to golf greens. {\an1}No votes, no golf. ♪ WEISS: There were bombs put in mailboxes. There were bombs at the doorsteps {\an1}of members of Parliament. {\an1}So there's a lot of fear in the American movement {\an1}that that kind of violence might come here. ADAMS: People in the National felt that Alice Paul {\an1}had become a creature of the Pankhursts. {\an7}She was going to import {\an7}Pankhurst attitudes and approaches {\an1}to a situation in the U.S. where these militant tactics {\an1}didn't belong at all. ZAHNISER: Alice Paul and Lucy Burns never thought that any kind of violent protestwould be successful in America, {\an1}but they never distancedthemselves from the Pankhursts. So they became more and more controversial. {\an8}NARRATOR: The last straw was delivered by Lucy Burns, {\an8}who advertised a suffrage meeting {\an7}by illegally chalking the sidewalk {\an7}across from the White House, {\an7}and thereby prompted {\an7}a much-publicized warrant for her arrest. {\an7}Shaw's reprimand came by letter. {\an1}"Immediately plead ignorance of the law {\an1}and pay whatever fine there is upon it," she instructed. {\an1}"You may think we are all a set of old fogies, {\an1}"and perhaps we are, {\an1}"but it requires a good deal more courage {\an1}"to work steadily and steadfastly {\an1}"for 40 or 50 years "to gain an end, {\an1}"than it does to do an impulsive, rash thing and lose it." ♪ {\an1}By December 1913, tensions were so high {\an1}that the National barred reporters from attending its annual convention. Just days later, Shaw appointed an entirely new committee {\an1}to oversee efforts in Washington, {\an1}and ousted Paul and Burns. {\an1}The fledgling Congressional Union's "militant" leaders, {\an1}Shaw told the press, "know nothing of American politics." WEISS: Schisms like this are very common in social movements, {\an1}especially reform movements. {\an1}We see it in the labor movement. We see it in the civil rights movement. {\an1}There is an impatiencewith the slow pace of progress, {\an7}and one group says, "We have to be more radical." ♪ CASSIDY: Alice Paul was very young in 1913. {\an1}She was in her mid-20s and she was probably naive. {\an1}But sometimes that level of ignorance, {\an1}not really knowing how hard the fight is, {\an1}is the only reason why you're going to engage in the fight. ♪ {\an1}(trolley bell rings, people talking in background) NARRATOR: As the wan winter sun rose on the morning {\an1}of February 7, 1915, {\an1}readers of "The New York Times" {\an1}turned the front pageof the Sunday editorial section and encountered a lengthy warning about a grave and imminent danger. ♪ A referendum scheduled for November 2 {\an1}that for the first time {\an1}would put the question of votes for women {\an1}directly to the electorate of New York state. {\an1}"Every man of voting age must meet the issue courageously, intelligently, with clear vision," {\an1}the editors urged. {\an1}"The grant of suffrage to women is repugnant. {\an1}"Without the counsel and guidance of men, {\an1}"no woman ever ruled a state wisely and well. {\an1}"The defect is innate, and one for which a cure {\an1}is both impossible and not to be desired." ♪ {\an1}It was enough to drive Harriot Stanton Blatch to distraction. ♪ While others dreamed of changing the U.S. Constitution, {\an1}Blatch had kept her focus on New York, {\an1}and by now, she'd been working for years just to convince the state legislature {\an1}to hold the referendum. DUBOIS: She understood that education, pleading, petitioning did not work. {\an1}You needed to evidence power. {\an1}You could do it by bringing hundreds of women to Albany. {\an1}You could do it by having 10,000 women march down Fifth Avenue. {\an1}But you needed to show {\an1}that there was power and intention, {\an1}and you had to force politicians to act. ♪ NARRATOR: The task of converting voters, Blatch knew, {\an1}would be Herculean by comparison, {\an1}but it had to be done. {\an1}Spurred by the furor over the national suffrage parade, {\an1}the House of Representatives recently had putthe federal amendment to a vote for the first time, and had proved {\an1}that the two-thirds majority required for passage {\an1}was well out of reach. "But if we win the Empire State," {\an1}Blatch told Alice Paul, "all the states will come tumbling down {\an1}like a pack of cards." ♪ DUBOIS: At this point, the federal Constitution {\an1}was still closed to women. {\an1}So it became the goal to break through {\an1}and to have a victory east of the Mississippi. And there, the big goal was New York. GOODIER: New York is a state with a very large population, many members of the Electoral College. {\an1}It's such an influential and prominent state. So for decades, {\an7}women suffragists had said, "New York is key." ♪ NARRATOR: The National Association had poured resources {\an1}into the campaign, {\an1}and over the course of 1915, {\an1}mobilized thousands of women across the state. {\an7}They stood in shop windows {\an7}to make so-called voiceless speeches, {\an1}carried a symbolic suffrage torch {\an1}to meetings from Chautauqua to Montauk, {\an1}and mailed suffrage valentines to everyone they knew. DUBOIS: They are doing everything to appeal to the emotions. {\an7}No longer interested in makingrational arguments for suffrage, {\an7}they want to have people care about {\an7}and be interested in {\an7}and excited about the suffrage movement. ♪ NARRATOR: The fervor was palpable all over the East that year, {\an1}as suffragists in New Jersey,Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts drove toward their own referenda. WALTON: Thousands of women marched in Boston. They took a liberty bell across the state of Pennsylvania. {\an1}Everybody planted yellow gardens. {\an1}You know, and women worked very, very hard. GOODIER: If women are going to get the right to vote, {\an1}they need to convince the most men possible {\an1}that they deserve the right to vote. {\an1}Every individual man who can vote {\an1}needs to be convinced. NARRATOR: Mindful of what was at stake {\an1}for tens of thousands of African American women, {\an1}and for voting rights in general, {\an1}the five-year-old National Association {\an1}for the Advancement of Colored People {\an1}put out a special issue of its monthly magazine, {\an1}featuring endorsements {\an1}from some of black America's foremost public figures, {\an1}who urged African American men to vote "yes." {\an1}For Mary Church Terrell, the former president {\an1}of the National Association of Colored Women, {\an1}it was incomprehensible that any black man should do otherwise. {\an1}"The same arguments used to prove {\an1}that the ballot be withheld from women," she pointed out, {\an1}"are advanced to prove that colored men {\an1}should not be allowed to vote." JONES: Black women have a stake in this question. If one is to be a full citizen, a true citizen-- {\an1}not a second-class citizen-- one will vote, {\an1}have access to the polls. {\an1}Keep a people away from the polls, {\an1}you will raise the significance of the vote tremendously. {\an1}"Why would you keep us away from the polls so long {\an1}if it wasn't in fact the route to power?" {\an8}♪ NARRATOR: By the fall, everyone was waiting to see {\an1}what Woodrow Wilson would do. {\an1}Expected to return to his home state of New Jersey {\an1}to vote in the referendum there, {\an1}the president was inundated with letters, hundreds of them from anti-suffrage women, {\an1}who begged him, as one put it, to "leave us a little longer {\an1}"in the quiet of our homes {\an1}"to rear our children well and care for our husbands {\an1}with undivided interest." To such women's profound disappointment, {\an1}Wilson announced on October 6 that he would vote yes. ♪ DUBOIS: Wilson, because of his reputation as a progressive, {\an1}can't publicly say that he's against women {\an1}having political rights, is basically a states' rights man {\an1}when it comes to suffrage. BEHN:He does it as a private citizen in a state-level vote {\an1}that doesn't have any national implications, {\an7}and, in fact, is explicit, speaking to his Southern base, {\an7}that he's not in favor of a federal amendment. {\an1}But that is a huge win in the minds {\an1}of many of the suffragists, {\an1}because now the president has indicated at least he's personally pro-suffrage. ♪ NARRATOR: On the eve of the New York referendum, {\an1}opinion polls were running almost even, for and against. {\an1}Harriot Stanton Blatch was cautiously optimistic, {\an1}and predicted a win by fewer than 10,000 votes. {\an1}Instead, the referendum lost, resoundingly. ♪ {\an1}A blow made more devastating by similar routs in New Jersey,Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. WALTON: These were four of the mostpopulous states in the country. {\an7}And there was a lot at stake, and they lost every state. ♪ DUBOIS: They failed. The 1915 campaign was well-run, well-funded, but it could not break through. ♪ NARRATOR:"I have never felt so vindictive in all my life," {\an1}Blatch raged to a reporter. {\an1}"Never again will I make anappeal to an individual voter." Just days later, an embattled Anna Howard Shaw {\an1}announced she would not be a candidate for re-election {\an1}to the National Association's presidency, {\an1}and the country's pre-eminent woman suffrage organization began the search for a new leader and yet another new path forward. ♪ KEYSSAR: In 1915, things looked very iffy. {\an1}The movement was at something of a crossroads. It had garnered a great deal of support. {\an1}Its social base was broader than it ever had been. {\an1}But it still faced a lot of opposition. ♪ {\an1}Figuring out what to do-- {\an1}should they proceed at the state level, should they go for a federal amendment-- {\an1}was a very live issue, {\an1}and it was not obvious that either path was going to work. WEISS: We don't want, it seems, everyone participating in our democracy. ♪ And that becomes one of the great themes {\an1}for the women fighting for women's suffrage. ♪ {\an1}Because how can you be a democracy {\an1}if half of the nation can't vote? ♪ ♪ OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
