You need a man with you. I've seen what's out there. So have I. So you know. I need to get to the stadium. Yes, we'll do it. Please, ma'am, I beg you. I'm Ben. What's your name? - Barbara. - Barbara... Are you Christian, Barbara? Yes. Barbara, I swear to God, I will protect you and get you to the stadium safely. Do you know what street this is? This is Hastings. Can you get to the stadium from here? I sure can. OK. OK! Would you like me to drive? You may as well... This isn't even my car. You don't have to explain. I understand. We do what we have to out here. Yes, we do. Can you unlock the door? Sure. Don't screw me. I promise I will not. It's not right. I will not. OK. I'm sliding over now. So, how old are your kids? Get out. - What? - Get out of the car. You're messing with me. Please. Shit! Get out of the car or I'll hurt you. You are a terrible person. You are going straight to hell, you piece of shit! Get out of the car! I'll punch you in the fucking face, bitch! - You hear me? - The door is locked, you shithead! Jesus! You're going to hell, fucker! Whatever, lady! Hey! Stop! Stop! - [thudding] - [groaning] [ominous music] [insects chirping] Are you sure this is the right street? This is where he said. I just... I think it's that way. Fuck.
