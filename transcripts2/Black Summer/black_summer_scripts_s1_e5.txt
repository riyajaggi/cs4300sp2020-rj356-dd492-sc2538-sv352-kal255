 Oye, Carmen, this is fucking bullshit. I ain't afraid of nothin', you hear me? Look, if I have to run this shit, I will. I don't give a fuck. Mm-hmm? Hmm... I love when you do that. You know what? For a little treat, you just sit back while papi chulo tells you a story, OK, mamacita? Ah... Look, when I was a kid, there was this kid in school, a big fucking kid.

 Used to fuck with me every day. And you know what? The truth is I was a little bitch, so I let him 'cause I didn't want to get hurt. So I figured, fuck, you know, eventually, he'd get tired, he'd leave me alone, but he never did. As a matter of fact, the motherfucker, the shit just got worse. So... ...I decided, baby, it's time for Manny to fucking man up. And I had to do something. I had to send a message to everybody. So check this out. Ha. Holy shit!

 Keep the blinds closed, you dumbasses! - Fuck you, puto! - Dumb motherfuckers. Hey, why don't you come over here and say it to my face? - Hey, shut up, man. - Alright. I'm gonna go whup this motherfucker's ass! Come on then! Come on then! Let me show you some respect, viejo! Goddamn! Come over here, I'll show you some fucking respect. Yeah, yeah. Shut the fuck up, OK? Listen to your woman, little boy. Just shut the fuck up too. Yeah, well, I got something for you too, lady. Huh? I should throw both your asses outside, - feed you to the sharks! - Alright, let's go then! This is your fucking fault! I'm sorry, alright? I let my emotions... ...get the best of me. It's these fucking punks though. These kids, this fucking generation. Not you. They just want everything handed to them, and I'm fucking sick of it, OK? This fucking sucks. Oh, this place is amazing! Shit! We're lucky to be here. What's the chance we'd find all this stuff? I don't feel as lucky as you. Huh? I've been through worse. Trust me, it's all about numbers, Carla. It's Carmen. Yeah, I think we're in a good position. You're saying that. Five of us, two of them. Basic math. Math, my ass! There ain't no five of us, man. Hey, look, man. I understand you're pissed. Pissed? Motherfucker, you ran us off the road! No, I didn't. That was Marvin, I didn't tell him to do that. And that lady, you killed her. Mm-hmm? - And that's on you. - No, that's on Marvin. And look at him now. Shit. Hey, what's... what's done is done. Look, just 'cause I hold the door for you three doesn't mean I fucking give a fuck about you, OK? As far as I'm concerned, I just didn't want more three more - of those things outside! - We don't have time for your feelings, brother. We gotta find a way out. Mm-hmm. Just keep your distance. That's all I'm saying. Hey, look, man. I get it, I'd be pissed off too. But those are the rules of the road, you should know that. And now we're here. Look, we go... we gotta work together. Hey. No, no, no. Let's... let's talk. OK? You and me. I'm right here. Man to man. Fuck it. - What's up? - Hey. Look, I don't even know those two. We all just jumped in the truck together. It is about me and you. We're the top dogs here. - Yeah, I know that. - We gotta come up with a plan. Yeah, I know. Hey, what's your name, brother? - William Velez. - Yeah. Nice to meet you, pal. - William. - How about I call you Velez, hm? - Yeah, that works, man. - Velez, I'm Phil. Yeah, whether you like it or not, it's up to me and you to get us out of here. No shit. And we're gonna figure this out for us, OK, get to that stadium. Yeah, we gotta get to that stadium. I got a family over there, and they're waiting for me and my... And you will, OK? Because everything is not what you think. What are you talking about? It's all been blown out of proportion. Yeah. I hear things, know people. What are you talking about, man? They got that shit contained. Yeah, they just can't share it with everybody. Right? And I get that. I mean, there are a lot of freeloaders out there. Like these fucking kids, see? These kids... So we gotta be vigilant and make the hard decisions. And we do that, we get out of here. To your family. Hmm? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright. OK, that's the first step. We gotta separate the.. the able bodies from the dead weight. Alright, that's why all this is happening in the first place. Right. Right, right. - OK, I'm in. - Alright. So let's talk it out. Huh? - What about her? - Who? The girl you're with. - What about her? - Well, do you know her? I mean, I don't know her, I mean, we don't... Well, do you trust her? I'm talking like you've been through the shit together so you bonded. I mean, do you trust her? Like big picture. Yeah. Yeah, she had my back out there. She... she's a good person, I trust her. Ah, alright. But do... do you know her? That's the question: how much do I really know? Right? I know people. I can tell. 'Cause we're in a predicament. Alright? And trust is everything. Fuck, there's one guy I could trust in the world: Marvin. Yeah? Well, that motherfucker shouldn't have run us off the road, right? And that's your buddy, right? She doesn't talk much, does she? Man. She don't even speak English, bro. Yeah. That's what... that's what I thought. You guys got any weapons or what? Well, not anymore. Yeah, those two were talking about an outpost near downtown. That's what I wanted to tell you about. No, no, no. Downtown is crazy. This area, I hear things about downtown. Not good over there. Yeah, it is. That's why we can't take everybody, but I can take you. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But like he says, "Strength in numbers," right? Yeah. To a point. And it's a balance. You know that guy? Well, he better watch himself. He doesn't know who he's fucking with. You speak English? No. They didn't let you on the trucks, right? You didn't have the papers? Yeah? Same with us. We came up through Arizona. Have you seen it? The horde? We saw it. We "was" up on the ridge, and we heard something. Sounded like a herd of buffalo. And then I look down... ...and I see this cloud of dust. Miles of it. Then I look closer. And I could see it moving. Like it was alive. There was thousands of them just tearing shit up. It's coming. Fuck! And you better believe that 'cause it's coming. You see, a lot of people think that they can't make it through water, but fuck that, they can. You know, you know ants? Ants, you know what I'm talking about? - Gaemi. - Yeah, gaemi. They're like that. They like, fucking... They stack on each other and make a bridge. That's how they do it. We need to get out of here. Stadium. Yeah. Stadium, that's not so easy. Where, uh... Why? Damn! You really don't fucking get it, do you? 'Cause you gotta go through downtown. There's like no way you're getting through that shit without some serious fucking firepower. Guns. We need weapons. And me and Manny, we know where to get them. I'm Carmen. Sun. He's Manny, my boyfriend. Hi. Alright. So can we all try and get along now, huh? Motherfuckers! They don't fucking stop. Hm, that's what they do, they're immortal. No, you can't be immortal if you ain't alive. They're not alive or dead. It's a parasite looking for hosts. Can't kill it. Hmm? What? Hei? Hei? Die. Yeah. They died in the crash. And then they woke up. It's true. It's not a fucking joke. They weren't bitten. No, they just died. That's fucked. Anything that dies turns. Well, we can't stop people from dying. What do we do now? I don't know. I can't think that far ahead right now. I really don't give a fuck about the world at this point. You know? I just wanna get back to my family, that's all. So family over humanity? Yeah. That's right. Where are you going? Aaah... Jesus, Marvin! Fuck, brother! Come on! - Well, they're hungry. - No kidding. Yeah, we're not getting anywhere as long as there's food inside. - Yeah, and we're the food. - Haha! If they keep banging that door, they're gonna bust - through eventually. - We gotta stop reminding them. When they don't see us for a while, they'll forget. Look, there's two of them and five of us. - We could take 'em out. - Shit, yes! I agree! Two on one, three on another. See, that's what we need. There's a plan. Yo, I'm down. So what's up? We go out there and we fight 'em? No, we just don't go there and fight 'em. We gotta... we gotta distract 'em and then jump 'em. I'm in. I'm in. And what if we don't get 'em? Well, then they can't eat all of us. I guess we take our chances, huh? Look, we gotta take 'em down and that's it, OK? I'm not gonna stay in here and wait for that wave to come crashing in on us. Did you hear me? We gotta go. - Hey, what did she say? - I don't know. Well, she doesn't agree with you. - You got a better idea? - Yo, yo, how do we stop 'em? We keep beating the fuck out of 'em until they stop moving! - We go for the heads! - No, no. We slow 'em down first, take 'em out at the knees. We need weapons. Fuck, yeah! Hahaha! Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. They're attracted to sound. And they can only concentrate on one thing at a time. - So we gotta distract them. - Who's going out there? - I'll go. - You're a good man, Velez. - I'll go with you. - I'll go. Yeah. Fuck it. So who's gonna distract them? She will. Yeah. She'll do it. She's good that way. OK. Here's the plan. You, what's your name? Joo Kyungsung. What?! Sun. Call her Sun. Alright, Sun, you hang by that window. I'm gonna call, you tap. OK? You "tappy, tappy" on the window. You got it? - Ye. - Then good. Hey, you two. You guys, take the back door. Hey, you OK? You keep tapping on the window. We're getting out of here, you know? Let's do this! You keep tapping on that window. Hurry. Get ready over there. Go! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait, wait! Wait, get in! What the fuck?! Fuck me. Hey. What is that? Look at that. Hey, sweetheart. Hey. Get out of the way! Move! You didn't go for the knees. Hey, I'm not letting that fucking thing touch me, OK? I'm not ready to die for all of you. No offense. You didn't even get close. Let's go back out there and do it again. We're not going back outside. Oh, did you have a better plan, Manny? No, you don't. Neither do either of you motherfuckers. I don't know who made you guys in charge. - Listen, little lady... - No, you listen to me, OK? Fuck you! I'm not gonna die in here because of... - Settle the fuck down! - Don't talk to her that way! Pointing fingers, that's not getting us anywhere! Fuck it! Let's just do a footrace, because I don't think I'm one of the slowest. Hey, Carmen, no. Fine! Fuck it, let's do it, huh? A footrace?! You want to run for it?! Fine, you take the front door; we'll take the back door! Fine with me! Fuck! Sun, what do you want to do? Yo, we didn't even slow those motherfuckers down, - and you all want a footrace?! - Let's think rationally. - What do they want? - What do you mean? - What is it that they want? - They want food. Fuck yes! They're hungry! So we give 'em food, so they can eat and we can get out of here, get some distance between us. OK. OK, shit. OK, fuck. So then what? We get the cans of soup or what? They don't eat fucking soup. What the fuck are you laughing at?! Hey, easy! Easy! Look. We give 'em something that they can snack on for a while. - Divert their attention. - Like what? Hmm? Like what? Hey. Hey. Let's talk. - Yeah, let's talk. - Hey. Hey. Hey. Why don't you talk in here, huh? Carmen, please. Wanna talk? Alright. What do you want to do, Sun? Ah! Ah! Oh! Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, come on. Should we get the fuck out of here or what? Hey! Should we go or what? You got a new plan? Velez... Velez? What? Look, Velez, it's not looking good. OK, you hear them out there? One more hard hit and they're inside. - So we deal with them. - No, no, no, no, no. Listen, it's not gonna happen. - So what do you want to do? - Well, we gotta do something. That horde is coming. OK, I don't know when. Tonight, tomorrow, fucking hours from now. So what the fuck do you wanna do? We need to feed them, buy us some time. You said that. Feed 'em what? We gotta make hard decisions. - It's the world we're living in. - And...? One of us isn't gonna make it. It's a fact. - OK, there's a weak link. - Uh-huh? And you decide who the weak link is, huh? We all know who it is. Jesus! She's small, - doesn't speak English, man. - No! Look, I don't like it any more than you do, but we're gonna die in here! You think you're gonna throw her out like that? Yes. I can get you to an outpost downtown. They have weapons there. I can get you to the stadium. Right? Find your family. Huh, that's what you want, right? I ain't doing it. OK, think before talk. - Fuck you. - No, no, you're overreacting. - No, man. You don't get it. - I don't get what? You wanna die in here? I ain't dying in here. Fuck, somebody is! Now, we can fight it out... ...or we can save ourselves and make a decision. Your call. - Bitch motherfucker. - Fuck you, viejo. So that's what it's gonna be? Yeah. I guess so. Fuck! Come on, you motherfuckers! Let's see who's got the guts! Come on. Come on, motherfucker. What? What are you talking about? What's that? Huh, your arm? It's a scratch, it's nothing. Uh-huh? Oh yeah. It's fucking nothing! I scratched it on the damn door. Oh, shut up, right! You're desperate! That shit could be infected. Oh, bullshit! You don't know what the fuck you're talking about! Yeah, you're fucking idiots if you listen to her! - How did you get that? - From the goddamn door! Yeah, you keep this up, I'll toss you out myself. I'm not gonna be railroaded by some fucking - foreign piece of shit! - Shut your fucking mouth! What's wrong with you, huh? RELAX, MAN! You sound nervous, huh? I'm not nervous, bitch! I-I'm pissed off. This is fucking madness! - Which door? - The fucking door! - Settle down! - Yeah, you're spreading lies. Yes. See, you're weak! You're weak and you're a liar; that's what's gonna get you killed! Let's go! Yeah, come on! - Come on, let's go, let's go! - No! No! No! God damn it! Fuck! Alright, if no one's gonna help me, I'll toss her out myself. - Back off, motherfucker... - Don't be stupid. - You're blowing it! - That's a fuckup, that's all I'm saying. I'll throw your ass myself! This is exactly what they want! This is the oldest trick in the book: turn the top dogs against each other. - You're gonna go down for her?! - She saved my life! Oh yeah? I was wrong about you. Don't have the guts - to make the tough decisions? - Just stay the fuck back! - That's all I'm saying, man! - Manny, get over here! - Don't listen to him. - Carmen, tell him. Get here. - Don't listen to him! - Let's finish this. You know what we have to do. Back up. Back up, Sun. Back up, Sun. Shut up, Sun. Stay out of this, Sun! Come on, motherfucker! Let's do this! I promise you, you're gonna fucking die! Yeah? Come on! Huh? No! This shouldn't be... Manny! Manny! Get the door! Get the door! Come on! Come on, you! Come on! No! Please! Come on now! Get that door! No! Please! Stop! No! Come on, come on, close the door! Fuck! Yeah. Yeah, I'm just gonna fall. Get up. I just need to rest real quick. Yeah. You have to get up. I'll be all right. No, no, no. No, no, no. Don't you quit on me, OK? No, no. No, I'm not. Just wanna... Just wanna... - Come on. Get up - ...sleep for just a second. - Get up. Please, get up. - Wanna sleep for just a second. - Yeah? No, no. Please don't... - I want you to go ahead. Hey! What? What is it? - Get up, please. - Alright. Alright. Hold on. Wait. Wait up. Do you see that too? Yep. Fuck! Two. That's enough. If they sit still. Fuck! We gotta get to the damn door before they come back. Wait. What if it's locked? No! Please! No! No! Please! Please, Manny!
