 Worthless bug! You saw the moon? Yes! One moon now! Planet changed! And that means... Earth. Yes. It means Megatron was right. And the disks... Give record of the future! Ultimate power! But Megatron has guarded! Lizard-bot and Waspinator team up? Get disks together! An excellent idea. Lizard-bot think so? You go first.

 Huh? NO! Hey! What's going on here!? He's taking the disks! Stop him! Ugh! Forget it! He's leaving and I'm not risking MY body to go after him! Fool! Those disks are more valuable than... Never mind... for now. I see the equipment we need. Easy! That's my body there! Oh sure. Don't mind Waspinator. Waspinator just lie here and suffer. Drag himself to CR tank. Not fair, always picking on me... At least this one fell where we could see it. Yeah, but two more dropped into Pred territory. And who knows where the others landed? That's what Airazor and I are going to find out. After you, my lady. Keep the fuel rods warm. We'll be in touch. Journey well, friends. You are part of this planet. Let its heart guide your own. Be careful, big cat. Always, little cat. Gah. You both goin' soft in the circuits or what? Come on! Why we lettin' this guy snooze? Let's crack th' egg and say hello! Not this one. It's a blank. A protoform without a Spark. Aw man! If that don't cut th' cheese. What good's that do us? None... at the moment. We can only hope that Megatron is having no better luck with the protoforms that landed near him. Critical scanner damage replication error datatrax not recoverable. Well! Looky what we got here! Who are you? For that matter... Who am I? I dunno, pal. But I'll tell ya one thing I do know. An' that is... I bet I can thrash yer tail! What!? Ya heard me! Come on, fuzz an' feathers! You an' me, we's gonna tangle! Right here, right now! For the Royalty! Tarnation! Another one thinks he's tougher'n me! We've done nothing to him. Surely there's been a misunderstanding... Yeah! Ol' blender-butt there misunderstands my need to kick his keister! Fool! Pain is my friend! Allow me to introduce you to it! Now, that's just dirty fighting. Hey, you! You've had your fun - now leave him alone! Oh look, a hero! My favorite! Ah, me. Such entertainment, yes. But I suppose, while they are distracted, I should attend to business. Computer! Access the new creatures' activation commands. Quickly! While their security circuits are still offline. Accessing... Insolent ones! Burn in the fires of Inferno! Goodbye bad cop, hello good cop. Yes. I am Megatron. A simple misunderstanding. I do apologize. I knew it! What, you trust this tin horn toad? Why should he not? We are all Predacons, If your datatrax had not been damaged in the crash, you would know this yourselves. You blow a pretty tune, stranger. But it's still hot air to me, lessn' ya can back yer claim. But of course, my good, uh... Call me Quickstrike. An' good's got nothin' t'do with it. I think my name's... Silverbolt. Yes. Pure. Strong. And fast. Ahem. Yes. Excellent. In any case, Quickstrike, and, uh... Silverbolt... my proof is a simple one. Just speak aloud the Predacon activation code: "Terrorize." There. You see? Now hold on. Ya mean all's I got to do is say. "Quickstrike, terrorize" and... AAAGH! Tarnation! And there you have it. New form, new weapons... new opportunity. Silverbolt... Terrorize? Hmm. It's not a word I like the taste of. Can't argue with the results, though! Excellent. Yess. Welcome, my new Predacons! Oh man! If that don't take th' chrome-plated cookie. Primal's been vaped, Dino-butt's disappeared, Stripes an' the bird lady are off on some World Cruise and now yer going offline!? Why don't we just open the front door and invite Megatron in? Can't be helped. When the alien device exploded it created a window into transwarp space. It won't last long. So what!? It ever occurred to ya we might need yer core consciousness right here!? Arrgh! What're YOU lookin' at? Get yer shiny new butt skyward an' see if you can find Chopperface before the Preds do! You mean fly!? Do I mean fly- No, I mean take a submarine! Of course I mean fly! Now get goin'! Aw right! Sheesh. Optimus, how did ya do it? To be... or not to be. That is the question. These disks I hold - - are they a record of what WILL be - - or only what of MAY? For if the future is indeed immutably foretold, then my demise is but moments from that confirmation, for I could not live if not the master of my fate. But IF... the future CAN be changed - - if these disks record merely one path of all the myriad ways the cosmos might conform - - then their power is infinite! And yet, still limited... for they could be used but once, and in that change be rendered fiction for evermore. I could destroy them! But... no. T'would be a coward's answer. I will know the truth instead. Then, t'will be either them or me that face oblivion. Till then! Yes... Yes! It's working... it's working... My Spark is restored - - and my body is stronger than ever! I LIVE! I LIIIIVEEE! Yes, excellent. Teamwork and cooperation; Those are the Predacon watchwords. How 'bout backstabbin' an' treachery? We can be flexible. But our main focus must always be the Maximals and their destruction. Destruction's good. I like destruction. Then you shall have your chance, my dear Quickstrike. Observe! Dinobot, come in. This is th' Cobalt Kitty callin'! Somebody's trying to cook this cat! Silverbolt! Pursue and destroy! Why? He's not attacking... NEVER question my orders! Now GO! Inferno! You bring Quickstrike and follow me! Megatron! Flight Mode! Aw man, I'm leadin' a Pred parade! Well, let's see if they can follow THIS leader! Oh yeah! Nothing like cat speed an' cornerin' ability... Uh, except maybe brute force! Jets! Maximum burn! This is Cheetor! Code one emergency! Oh sure, like things weren't bad enough. What you done now? Ran into a Pred nest in Delta Quadrant! Couple new nasties, plus Megs himself! They're on my tail! Pussycat, you really know how to tickle my joystick. Oooh kay. We'll lay out th' welcome mat. Sentinel! Autoguns online. Stand ready for full alert. Yo, Rhinox. - Sorry t' interrupt yer nap, but company's com... ACK! - DANGER! Unit Rhinox's core consciousness has extended beyond measurable limits. Any disturbance will result in permanent loss of Spark. Oh sure, now there's some great timin' for ya! What is happening? Sentinel is on alert! Hey! Chopperface! Where you been!? Out savin' the universe or something? Possibly, yes. Now what is the emergency? Oh, nothin' much. Let's see: Rhinox is off chasin' comets with his mind, and Cheetor's bringin' a squad of Preds home t'play. 'Course, if they hit this place, Big Green there goes permanently offline. Then we must take the fight... to the enemy! Brodie mode! Maximum rubber-burn! Pfah! Accursed rodent. Oh no ya don't, ya fan-fannied freak! Predacons! Regroup around my position! So. You're a big bad Transmetal now, hunh? Well, I'll still hose your head with high-powered ammo if you come another step closer. I think not! Witless widow! I left a psychic link between us. Even in this body, I can still control you! This is Megatron calling Predacon base! This is Tarantulas. Ah, excellent! You are back online - and a transmetal as well! Yes. Yohoo! Waspinator here too! Lizard-bot invade base, but Waspinator... Silence! Just converge on my coordinates! It is time to finish off the Maximals for good!
