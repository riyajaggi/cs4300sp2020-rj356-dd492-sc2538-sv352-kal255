 Decepticons FOREVER!!! Heaaaaaaaads uuuuuup! No! My hero. Oh get down. Well, there goes our ride home. Guess it's over for now. No chance. Something turned that Decepticon against us. And Megatron isn't headed back to base. We've got to stop him. Flight mode! Rhinox. Get on. Gotta move fast, Maximals. If Megatron's found what I think he's found then this battle is only just beginning! What are you looking at? That star... well, planet, really. It's Venus. It reminds me of you. Hot, poisonous and deadly? You're sweet. No, no wait! That's not what I meant... Stay with the group. When Megatron lands we'll need all our fire-power. Where he's headed, Big Bot? To the begining of everything, Cheetor. And quite possibly - the end. Look! I think we're almost through. Then stand back! Wait! We just... Never mind. What is it with guys and high explosives? By the Matrix! What is it? That, bowser boy, is called... The Ark! I have heard only legends. Oh, it's no legend, JoJo. Eons before Maximals and Predacons even existed. Your ancestors, the Autobots, launched this Ark containing their... finest heroes. It was attacked by Decepticons and crashed here, on Earth. This area appears geologically unstable. Hello! It's a volcano, bonebrain. When it explodes in 1984, our ancestors inside the ship will awaken and start the Great War. Then this is why Optimus was worried! Its power is immense! Oh, yeah! And it's all mine. So what do we do? Dig. Arrgh. Teletran-1 is still operating. Shame. Don't you have the access codes from the disk? The disk was destroyed. But YOU have the codes, don't you? Yess. You downloaded them from my backup datatrax, before you destroyed them. Well, what if I did? They're MINE now, grapeface. So what are you going to do? Shoot me? You still don't have the codes. Oh, I was never planning on shooting you, no. I had a much more... effective target in mind. The codes, Blackarachnia. Produce them at once. Whoa! Is this volcano active? Right now I think we've got bigger problems. Move it, bots! We've got an entrance to make! Well? Well what? Shoot him if you want. He means nothing to me. OF course, it's a waste of ammo. Of course. Keep digging! We're almost there! Sounds like the Maximals have arrived. You'd better get out of here. Perhaps. But first, I think I will vaporize a possible menace. Wait! I'll do it. Almost there! But only becouse we have to get to cover anyway. Stand aside! Computer! Decrypt and transmit access code now! Acknowledged. Is it working!? It better! NO! By Primus, NO! Whoa! The ARK! Oh, brother, we're in for it now. Excellent. Keep them busy, Blackarachnia, yes. Where are YOU going? I shall effect a more... permanent solution. We HAVE to get Megatron out of there! Everything that is, the existence of entire Universe depends on it! You got it, BigBot. Man, that ship wasn't built, it was poured! Diecast construction. It's a lost art. Now I enter these hallowed halls a conquerer, yes. Autobots and Decepticons, still frozen in emergency stasis. Awaiting the moment, four million years hence, when they will awaken to start the Great War. The Great War. Where the Autobots defeat the Decepticons. And thus their descendents, the Maximals, rule we Predacons. Archaic energon-guzzlers! How dare they! Unwilling though I was to follow my namesake's instructions, it has all come down to this. The ultimate risk for the ultimate prize! A day of reckoning with those who made us slaves! Concentrate your fire on that fusion cannon! If we can force a backblast... We did it! Let's move! So we are now face-to-face, Optimus Prime. In one future you awaken and become the great leader of the Autobots. But time shall take a different track now. Computer. All available power to primary weapon. Weapon power to maximum. We have to get inside! It's jammed! The power surge musta... Aaaargh! Hurry! And now, Optimus Prime. In memory of the Decepticons. For the glory of the Predacons. For the Cybertron that is rightfully ours... And mine to rule. Come on, come on! I unleash the storm of vengeance. Farewell. Nooo! Time itself! It's all being destroyed! Say goodbye to the Universe, Maximals! The future has changed! Yess! The Autobots loose. Evil triumphs! And YOU - you no longer EXIST! To be continued?
