 Who did this to you? Those at the medical center. They said we were unique subjects. The children are fine. Healthy and happy. We're alternating extractions and injections. I await your instructions. Kisses, sister. Let's toast to the absolute defeat of the virus. I'm so sorry about... your friend's accident. Somebody tried to shoot me, was that an accident too? There was a shooting to avoid a terrorist escaping. Minister, get on the floor!

 But you weren't with her, were you? -Excuse me, ma'am. -Take him, now! He's the minister's nephew. Jesus. -Why are you here? -About my friend. And you? Clara asked me to get something. Keep the phone. If something happens, call me. -Do the owners of the store live here? -We think our son's in there. -He's got big brown eyes. -And two big moles behind his ear. Why would they steal the boy? I don't know, but we have to take him back or they'll ask questions. If we don't take him back,

 the family he's with will worry. You'll end up in jail. You're coming to sleep over with us. Oh my God, Marta. Where is he? Where's the boy? -Ma'am, I know... -Where is he? -I know we should've... -Where is he? He's sleeping with Marta. Sergio. The lights don't work, Auntie. We're leaving. Now! Come on, get ready. Come on, help me. You'd better not talk to her. Talk to Luis, not her. We're so sorry about what's happened, honestly. We understand you were scared, but the boy is fine. We took him home. You weren't there and we decided not to leave him alone. Not to leave him alone? Of course. I can't believe this. Really... Who do you think you are to make such a decision? Ma'am, listen, -a couple turned up... -I don't care! You know how I felt when I didn't see my boy in his bed? Remember how you felt when Marta was missing? If you don't, don't worry. You'll soon feel it again when they take her again because you're unemployed. You're fired. Don't ever come back! -What...? But... -Come, honey. -Are you okay? -Shit. Wait, ma'am. -Don't you dare touch me. -I'm begging you. Come, honey. Sweetie, relax. Did that just happen? Can they fire you like that? -Shit... -She's a bitch! Unbelievable. I won't let it happen. They won't take Marta again. Don't waste time, go talk to Luis, now. -Now. -Yes, let's go. REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE BUILD THE FUTURE REMEMBER THE RAIN LAUGH AGAINST THE WALL MEMORY RIGHTS ARE SEIZED THE BARRIER Go with Rosa, Sergio. -Alejo, what's the matter? -Calm down, Alma. The kids are good. Good morning, Alejo. They're having breakfast now. We have fresh milk... They're happy here. But we should be patient. Some are very weak. We can't push them anymore. Don't be a coward, little brother. Remember Mom. "You have to push ahead." Let's do it. Take anything you want, but don't hurt me. Please. Take anything you want and leave! Leave! Calm down... It's me, Mom. That can't be. It can't be. It can't be. My boy... My boy... You're alive. I knew it, my dear. In recent weeks, 500 new cases have been reported of noravirus. Although checkpoints to Madrid have been reinforced, a source of infection has been detected in Alcorcón. The area has been cordoned off and access forbidden. This is a reminder that... Things are getting worse. What could happen? Madrid might be put under lockdown. If it is, we'll have supply problems. -My goodness. -Yes. -Let's go. -Yeah. ...have your documentation handy and show it when... Hi, good morning. This pass is not valid. Not valid? That can't be right. You know us, we come past every day. This way. For your safety... Try again, please. Not valid. -Why not? -Impossible. Please, check the registers. It must be a mistake. We work for a very important person. And who's that? -The Minister of Health. -Yeah. We can't be late. Please... Let me see. Watch out! -She's sick! She's got the virus! -Halt! Halt! Blockade! Blockade! Come on, go, go, quickly! They work for the minister, let them go. Okay. Go, go. Request for biochemical containment backup. NAME DATE OF BIRTH Emilia. Emilia... -Yes? -Are you okay? Yes. What are you thinking? I don't understand... I don't understand why Carlos gave my daughter pictures to bring here, risking his life in the process. I don't understand why Marta and Sergio are there. How are they related? What's their connection to the other kids? You know what I think? Maybe they didn't take Marta because your brother was unemployed. Maybe they wanted to kidnap her. What? Why would they do that? There was a time... Some years ago, this rumor spread. A group of parents were looking for their missing children. They said they were taken from hospitals through deception. They were assured they were dead. You'd hear it in the streets for a long time. Then, suddenly... you stopped hearing about it. The rumor disappeared. I know those kids! I know those kids. From the medical center. They took them. You should go back to bed. It's still early. No, wait. Where did they take them, sweetie? We'll meet again, our homeland's name They took some of us out and took us on a bus. We were so tired and fell asleep. Those kids also wanted to be back with their parents, just like me. We have to do something, Emilia. We need to find those families. Come, my dear. Come. NAME DATE OF BIRTH UNIQUE SUBJECTS THE FUTURE BELONGS TO US Next stop, C2 zone. Hello? Rosa! Manuela! Open the gate, please! Rai, we've come to talk to the master. You can't come in. You don't work here. -Please, Rai... -Rai, it's important. Then you can call them. I'm sure they'll answer. -Let us in Rai, don't be a bastard. -What did you call me? You heard me. You're a bastard. -Let us in, please. -Okay, okay. -Please. -Rai... Get out of here, now. We're not going anywhere! Manuela! -Don't touch her. -Rosa! -Don't. -Please. -Rai... -Miss, we need to talk to your father. It's a complex matter, okay? About Sergio. We really need to come in. Rai, let them in. Jesus. Thanks. -Come here, don't you dare... -Rosa, let go. -Don't you dare bother the master! -Rosa, I don't want to hurt you. Sara, darling. And now her! Please... -Sir. -What's the matter? Sir, we're sorry to burst in like this, but you have to listen. -If it's about your dismissal... -Just a minute. Please. They're with my husband? Was I not clear when I told them not to come back? I'll help you, ma'am. Enough! Who let them in, Rosa? I don't know, ma'am. I really don't. Some people say they're Sergio's parents. What? We brought the boy back yesterday... and tried to talk to you, but you weren't here. And that's why we took him home with us. They say... He was taken through deception. He was stolen. And they said some things about the boy, they seem to know him well. You see? Why are you here? How dare you? -Alma, wait. -I won't. I'm calling the police. And you... Did I not tell you they were fired? They virtually kidnapped Sergio! Do you know what I went through? Are you done? Good. Now listen to them. Please, it's important. -Listen, ma'am. -You have one minute. I don't get you. Alma, do you remember the last name of Sergio's parents? -What? -Yes, they know perfectly well Sergio isn't our nephew, it's just an affectionate saying. Juan. His name's Juan. That's his real name, isn't it? Where did you hear that? A married couple told us. I think it's important you listen to them. Can you wait in the kitchen, please? Thanks. It could be them. If someone comes right now saying she's Sergio's mother, it's to get money from us. Surely they're working with the servants! -Don't you see? -I don't know. I don't. In any case, I want to meet them. Why? Because we owe it to Sergio. Or Juan. Don't you think? Sign here and here. I told you on day one you wouldn't last. What have you done? Get involved in another's business. They always do, haven't you noticed? Sign. We're not signing anything. Ah, I see. Then you'll have to leave with nothing. Come on, sign. It's for your own good. We can't, Rosa. We can't accept being fired, for our daughter's sake. It's too late for that! How could you take the boy? He's the apple of the lady's eye! That's not true, Rosa. He isn't. You know better than anyone that he's always alone. Right, Manuela? He may be alone, but he's got a home. A roof and a future! You talk like you're from another planet! Yes, a planet where people love and respect each other. Why not talk to miss Daniela? I'm sure she'll help. Unless the president himself comes to help them... The lady's a tough cookie and she's very upset. Come on, sign before she comes in here. Hugo! I've talked to my wife and there was a misunderstanding. -You'll continue working for us. -Thanks a lot, sir. Go find that couple tomorrow morning. I've got too much work today. Use my car. Sure, sir. I'll go get changed, my dear. Sure. That's great, isn't it? You were born under a damn lucky star. Go and check on Sergio, he refused to have breakfast. Of course, Rosa. This house is so odd... I'm sorry? Four months ago, they wouldn't have lasted a minute. And now look. The master has really changed. Come on, let's get to work! Take out the trash and don't forget to recycle the glass. Yes. Hello. Sara! Hello. How are you? Are you okay? Yes. Iván is looking after me. I see... But I've got a tummy ache. What do you mean? Why? Did you come to say goodbye? Auntie told me you're leaving. -I'm not. I'm staying with you. -Great! No way! You weren't fired? Awesome. Then get the kid some breakfast. Lucky me, honey. I'm an awful babysitter. Well, I'm better if it's girls over 16 years old. I see. So? Shall we get dressed? -Yes. -And go to the park? -Yes. -Then come on, let's go. Go, go, go. There are your clothes. Go. Mom, you're coming with me. We'll see where. Now, pack up your stuff and let's leave as soon as possible, okay? Son, look at me. -I'm blind and very old. -Mom... For me, my time with you has been the best thing in my life. -Mom, please... -I can't ask for more. You go, before they find you, and forget about me. Mom, listen. We haven't got time to talk. Put whatever you need in a bag and let's go, please. Sure. Mom, we need to travel light, okay? Take only what's essential. Are you okay, Mom? Mom? Mom! For your safety, the curfew begins in 15 minutes. We ask that citizens return home in an orderly fashion. What are you doing? Leave everything you have. Come on. Do it. Go. Come on. This too? Nothing else? Come on. We'll take you somewhere comfortable. Hold on, I want to call my lawyer. Who? Your lawyer? Yeah, my lawyer, why? A lawyer? You? You're a nobody. Move. I don't want to go, dammit! Any news? No, sir. Hello. -We've made it. -Yes. -Thanks. -No problem. Hello. Hello. -How are you? -Anxious. Yeah? Okay then, the minister's waiting inside. Thanks. Please, come in. You can sit here. The masters will be right in. Here we are. I'm so sorry... Thanks for coming. This is awkward. Luis. Nice to meet you. Manuel. Let's sit down, we have lots to talk about. Rosa, you can leave. Not you. Please stay. Well, I must tell you I'm utterly appalled about this matter. I really understand you... As you can imagine, Sergio is a son to me. Sara and Hugo have told us your story. We were... At the hospital, they told us he had died. That he caught the virus, right? Manuel, darling, they know that. Luis, will you hand me those files? Yes. We signed these files when we got custody of the boy. Sorry. This lists Sergio's illness. Look what it says... here. Sergio was very sick and we took him in because his parents abandoned him. And, excuse me, here's the file where you give up custody. That's not true, it isn't true... We never signed anything. We'd never abandon our child. Never. Honestly, you don't have to feel guilty. A child whose life expectancy was so uncertain... It's nothing like that. He was my son. I'd never have abandoned him. You knew about Sergio's condition, right? Sergio's illness needs complex treatment. He receives regular transfusions. When we adopted him, he had a few years left to live. And we took him in anyway. Who the hell do you work for? For no one. I'm actually looking for work. So if you hear about anything, I'd appreciate it. Did he say anything? Not yet. We are just getting warming up. Give me half an hour and I'll get... Untie him and take him to my office. Pardon me? You heard me. Untie him and take him to my office, God dammit! Is my son going to die? We are hopeful now. With his treatment, he's likely to have a long life ahead. Right, honey? But we can look after him. I'm a hairdresser, my wife sews. We'll give him everything we can. Just tell us what we have to do. This is an experimental treatment, but perhaps we could help you fund it... That's not enough. He needs constant medical care, you know that. Alright, they could hire someone. Please. It isn't that easy, honey. Sorry. Excuse my husband. He isn't aware of what Sergio's illness entails. Luis doesn't spend much at home because of his job in the government. I'm the one who's been looking after Sergio all these years. Yes, that's right. No one knows as much as my wife does about what your son's treatment entails. I... I mean, I don't really understand this. He was born healthy, we weren't told anything about a condition. Obviously, both you and we are victims. But the biggest victim here who we all have to think about is Sergio. Do you follow me? What do you mean? You have to make a decision. Sergio is very delicate, sensitive to changes, and to deliver this news, that his parents are alive, in his condition... Then I don't get it, what do you want us to do? Think carefully about it. Be kind to your son. Whatever decision you make, do so thinking about him, not yourselves. Let's give them a moment. -Please. -They need to think it over. Sure, of course. Coffee, please. No, an infusion is better. It's too many emotions. I can't believe they're doing this! I honestly can't. Come on, don't be like that. You're right, but, I don't know, you know the boy is sick. Isn't he? -You told me yourself. -I don't know, Hugo. He doesn't look very sick. They're doctors, Manuel. What can we know about that illness? If we take him home and something happens... The best thing for a child is to be with his parents, always. No way, María, we can't leave him here. I can't lose my son again. Besides, his parents have to make this decision. You think I don't want to go get him right now... and tell him we are his parents, that we've been thinking about him every day... all these years? I don't believe a word Alma says. She's manipulating them so they leave Sergio here. I picture him running in the garden, laughing, swimming in the pool... I'm just saying Alma has the financial means necessary for Sergio to survive, that's it. -What can we give him? -Well... So, it all comes down to money, right? Is that what you're saying? We can give him love. Look. I'd have given up everything to save your sister's life. Understand? Get in there. Where did you get those posters? Nowhere. I made them. Why are you putting them up? Those children are missing. I know that. I asked why you were putting them up. I just wanted to talk to the parents. As far as I know, it isn't a crime to talk to people. It isn't. So what do you want to tell them? Do you know something they don't? Maybe. What do you know? Look, if you go into that room again, I don't think you'll come back out. So it's in your best interest to answer. What do you know? Those children might be alive. Hello. I'm Daniela Covarrubias, this man's lawyer. And the minister's daughter. Are there any charges against my client? No. Not yet. If you'd like to contact him, here's my number. Are we going to the park? I don't know if we can, sweetie. -Can we see with him? -Sorry, not today. It'd be awkward for the boy. We don't want him afraid or upset. Look, Sergio, do you remember them? Is something wrong, Auntie? No, my dear. They just wanted to say goodbye, they're leaving. We had fun playing the other day, huh? Yes. Want to play again? Can they, Auntie? We'd love to, but not today, honey. Did you know we knew your mom? And your dad. They loved you so much. So, so much. More than anything in the world. And they gave us this for you. Thanks. What was my mom like? You're just like her. She was kind. And very smart. -And she wanted the best for you. -Well, thanks for everything. But Sergio's spending today with Auntie. Shall we watch some TV? Bye. Show me. What's this? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You've been very brave. Well, you know how to find me. I'm at your disposal for anything you might need. I couldn't tell him how much I love him. The minister said we can come back any time. -We can, right? -Of course you can. Then you can be alone with Juan. I'm not sure they'll let us be completely alone. Of course they will. Yes, of course. This is just the beginning, okay? I'm sorry it ended this way today. Anything you need, anything, we're here for you, okay? Well... I'd have fought for my son till the end, you know? But this is the only war I can't win. At least this time, I feel like I helped save his life. Sure you have. You did well. Don't do this, Luis. They have realized this is the best for their son. His parents are the only ones who can make this decision. Luis, my love... Stop thinking about it, it does no good. Promise you'll stop thinking about it. Promise me. Luis, my love. Yeah? Hello? Hi, Begoña. How is everything? Actually, I was going to ask you the same thing. What happened last night? I heard yelling. Oh, it was silly, you wouldn't believe me. The minister asked us to take his nephew for the night and he must have forgotten to tell his wife. -You don't say... -Yeah. What a fright she must have had. Indeed. That's what happens when you marry a minister, working all day long, never with their family. What can I get you? Huh? I'll be back tomorrow. I'll get some pulses tomorrow. Then see you tomorrow. What's that? -What? -Emilia, something's ringing. What is it? I'm getting deafer and deafer. It's a music box my granddaughter forgot. -What's the matter? -I just remembered something. Your daughter Julia left many days ago. You haven't heard from her yet? No, I haven't. Not a message, a letter, a phone call, nothing? I told you I haven't. What, you don't trust me? My job is not to trust anyone, you know that. Put some chickpeas aside for tomorrow. See you, Begoña. Yes? Hello? Who is this? I'm calling about the posters. Do you know one of them? One of them was my son. Now that's some welcome... How did it go? So-so. For now, they've accepted my conditions. For now, you said it. And your husband? I can't rely on him. It hurts, but it's true. Alma, you know things can't stay the way they are. Do you understand? Do you mean Luis? Him too, but that's for you to deal with. You know. I mean the other thing. You tried, but there can't be loose ends... Don't tell me. Do what you must. As you wish. Does it hurt? A lot. It hurts a lot. But you know what hurts me most? What? My pride. My fucking pride. Who would be so stupid? You thought they'd call you just like that? I did. How can you be so naive? If your son went missing, wouldn't you like to know he's alive? Of course, but you have to be smarter than them. You can't go straight in. What are you doing? What? -It's from Emilia. -What? A mother called, Jesus! Hold on. I know you might be afraid, you're scared. So am I. But that's normal. The fact we've gathered together entails a great risk, and we know that. But there's something stronger and more powerful: courage... and hope that one day you can see your children again. I propose... voting... to see who's in favor. Please, raise your hand if you want to move forward. Hi, Sergio. You can't imagine how happy we were to see you again. We met you a long time ago, when you were a lot younger. We can't wait to see you again. Actually, we have a surprise for you. You told us you liked cakes a lot, so we'll bring the nicest and biggest cake that you'll ever have. You hardly know us, but we've always loved you lots. Life can be tough, but it can surprise you with really nice things. And you're the greatest joy it's ever given us. So you have to try and be as happy as you can and never lose that wonderful smile of yours. We know they love and look after you where you live. You have to play and laugh lots, and learn lots of things at school so when you grow up, you can be whatever you want to be, a lawyer or a doctor... We'll always be close, watching as you grow, as your dreams come true and you become a grown man. It's fine. You're laughing? What do you mean fine? If you ever feel lonely or sad and have no one to play with or talk to, we'll be there, always waiting with open arms. You're very special to us, so don't forget that we love you, we'll always be by your side. A huge kiss and see you soon. For your safety, respect your turn to enter sector 1 and have your documentation ready when it is requested. Fernando. Our baby, Fernando... Our baby, Fernando... -Hi. -Hi, little sister. How are you? Not as good as you. Where is everyone? Come, I'll fill you in. I did as you asked. We increased the dose, but over half have died. Then we'll have to bring in more children. Many more. -There's something else. -Tell me. I was working on the new tests you asked me to, the DNA sequences. I extracted the subunits from the CIM children's samples. -I've just finished. -And? I have results. I want to do it again to make sure, but the antibodies are really high. -How high? -Five hundred per cent. -Whose? -That's the funny thing. She isn't here. She didn't make it to the camp. Didn't make it? Welcome. You're new. These special children are our last hope. Some are angels. My angels... Where's my daughter? What did you do with her? Find her. Nothing makes me happier than having saved your daughter. She isn't at the camp. It's the girl. What girl? Marta, the daughter of the folks who work at my house. Sergio's parents were found dead. Are you responsible for this? This is not a coincidence. They were killed, for sure. -When was that? -Yesterday. What if our son is alive? Not again, okay? I can't go through this again, Alicia. I suspect you're one of the few things that matter in life. I'll do anything for this to work. We're so sorry, sir. They didn't listen to me and trusted you. And those aren't my country's flag! Dammit! Step back. Things are getting worse, the virus is past the fence. She's pregnant. It's Manuela, Mom. Search the house for Manuela, now! You'll help her, right? I'll do what's best for her. And for you.
