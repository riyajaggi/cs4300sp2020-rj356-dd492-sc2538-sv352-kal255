 When Tessa overhears George break up with his girlfriend, Zoe, on Skype, she blames herself for his failed relationship and decides that she's going to get them back together. Unbeknownst to her, though, George is really enamored with Tessa's cute art teacher, Aimee. He admits to Mr. Wolfe that he's over dating crazy city women, and that he's looking for love in the burbs.

 There's something so phony about Christmas in Chatswin. Everything plastic and professionally decorated. There was also something phony about Dad. After discovering he had a life in Manhattan, I had no choice... ...but to give him the ice treatment. Did we get the best tree at the farm or what? Fraser fir. You smell? You smell how fresh those needles are? Why do we bother? Aren't you gonna spend Christmas with Zoe? Now, I had administered the ice treatment... ...but never successfully. Until tonight. You're dumping me? Like now?

 No, not dumping. No. Not at all. But, yes. Now. Whenever I start to feel something... Like, whenever I start to feel... - Okay. It's okay. Don't cry. - I need a tissue, or a... - Okay, look. It's not you, it's... - Are you kidding me? I swear to God, if you say HS not you, HS me... I was going to say, it is not you, it's... it's Tessa, my daughter. You know, I uprooted her from New York, and everything she knows. - Yeah, so? - So it's a total double standard... ...if I date a cool city girl like you when I've confined Tessa to the suburbs. - But I'm crazy about you, George. - And I you. But if I continue seeing you, I will feel like a bad dad. Take care now.

 Dad, you didn't have to break up with her because of me. Oh, Tessa. Eavesdropping, were we? Was it the ice treatment? Yes, in fact, it was. But you know what? Maybe next time you will think twice before you ice someone. - But you really liked Zoe. - Yes, I did. But, sometimes, parents sacrifice things that they like for their children. If you will excuse me, I'm going to drink this in my room. Did he drink it in his room? I think he did. Wow, that has everything you want in a Christmas story. Except a happy ending. - I can make it up to him. - You should. I just need to get him the best gift any daughter's ever given their father. How about an eyeglass-repair kit? Doesn't exactly say, "Sorry you gave up love for me." No, but they usually come with cleaning solution and a lint-free chamois, so... There's not one good thing on the Internet. What are you getting your dad? Nothing. We make our gifts. - That sounds cool. - It's not. I want clothes. Now, the hot heat of the oven hits the... I felt terrible about Dad's breakup... ...and I was determined to make it up to him. - I made you a sandwich. - What kind of sandwich? Tuna. Tuna reminds me of Zoe. George may have been milking it, but he was exhibiting the signs of depression. Well, I should get to class. Watching the cooking channel... ...and taking an Adult Ed class in wreath-making. Wonderful job. - Lovely. - What's the deal with the art teacher? What do you mean "what's the deal?" There is no deal. She teaches art. Is she single? Shh. Oh, my. What can I say? They're both so full of beauty. True, but isn't one filled with a thousand times more beauty than the other? No. Not to me. That's like asking what's more magical, flowers or rainbows. - Rainbows. Is there any question? - Aimee? Uh, when you have a minute. - Aimee to the rescue. - Yeah. Heh, heh, heh. - Okay. - You know what? After dating so many crazy Manhattan women, I really find Aimee refreshing. - Ginger ale is refreshing. - You know, I like her positivity. And her... And her sweetness. You know, she's sweet. And she's crafty. She makes things. - I'm gonna ask her out. - Slow down, white tiger. - Yeah. - Aimee just went through a breakup... ...with the shop teacher. - She's a little gun-shy, okay? A little vulnerable. - Huh. So don't blow it by coming on too New York. Pushy. You're kind of pushy. But I wouldn't be if I were trying to date you. Oh, what a shame, Aimee. Honestly, I can't imagine you not having a Christmas tree. I know. It's my roommates, though. They're, um, Jehovah's Witnesses. They're really nice, but a little cliquey. Anyway, I sure will miss the smell of pine. - I have the smell of pine. - What's that? Uh, I was... I was just saying that I have a great big, giant tree. That smells like pine. Ahem. That I cut down myself. Wow. - That wasn't sarcastic? - Sarcastic? Oh, gosh, no. And you didn't mean, "Gosh, no" ironically? - No. Gosh, heh. - I'm just checking. So, what do you say? You wanna swing by my house, help me trim the tree? There's, uh, an open house kind of thing, lot of people, no pressure. Just a cool hang kind of sitch. When you put it like that, it sounds like a blast. And that was sincere. Sincerely, I would love to come. - Great. - What time should we be there? - Well... - I'll bring my Pa Jun. Heh, heh. Frankincense. Myrrh. Soap on a rope. None of these gifts were gonna cut it. This year, the only thing I could give George was the thing I had taken away... ...Zoe. It wasn't you. It was me. I got blindsided, like Sandra Bullock in that movie, The Proposal. I don't know if I can put myself out there again. Oh, come on. You look like the kind of woman who puts herself out there a lot. I do. Yeah. Heh, I have a big heart. And this time, I promise I won't be an obstacle to love. - Please come to the tree-trimming. - Oh, Mother Mary, kid. I don't know. Uh, George misses you. He's not himself. I've never seen him like this. Yeah? Well, the sex was rocking. And I do get super horny around Christmas, heh, heh. Okay, I'm in. You are gonna be the best gift lever got him. So, what's the best way to get there? Should I MapQuest it or Google Maps? She would figure it out. Honey, terrific news. Looks like those leg presses are starting to pay off. - Well, how could they not? - I'll bet you my thighs, minimum... ...are an inch bigger than last Christmas. - No way I'm taking that bet. - That's a smart lady. George. - Ahh. - Hey. - Oh, George, I was just thinking about you. - Steven let me in. - I don't think he likes me. - Oh, don't be silly. Heh, heh. Well, I wanted to invite you to a tree-trimming tonight. - I know it's last minute, but... - Oh, I would love to be there. Absolutely. It's only... Shoot. I'm headed off to go skiing in Aspen. It's a family tradition. Steven loves the way he looks in ski pants. That's too bad. You'll be missed. Anyway, I guess I'll see you when you get back. Until then, here you go, heh. - For me? From you? - Just something for under your tree. - I hope you like. - Oh, George, I'm gonna love. 'Twas the night before Christmas and I had nailed it. I had gotten Dad a present too big to fit under the tree. In a matter of minutes, Zoe was gonna walk across our threshold to see... George all over Ms. Ainsley, the art teacher? It's terrifying. I mean, she's so terrified of... You can't take my coat because I'm not wearing one. My mother told me to, but I refused, since we live right across the street. It's cold. I ran partway. Zoe's gonna be here any second and George is all over Ms. Ainsley. - Ms. Ainsley? Why? - He's rebounding. Hard. - I've been there, sister. - Okay, so here's the plan. I need you to wait for Zoe and delay her while I get rid of Ms. Ainsley. - That's the plan? - Yeah. Let's try it. I don't have a coat. Oh, hi. - Have you tried the Pa Jun? I don't know who made it, but someone knows their way around a pancake. George. I wouldn't interrupt unless this was super important... -...but we are out of eggnog. - What? I just, ugh... - I just made a batch 10 minutes ago. - I don't know the specifics. I just know people are in need of nog. I'll be right back. You know, your dad is the nicest parent at school. And the cutest. Really? Uh, at home he's a bit of a slob. You should see his bathroom. Some mornings, it's, like, crime scene. Whoa. That snow is really coming down. If I were you, I would leave right now. Or else... You might get stranded in a snow bank. And die. - Hey, hey. - Hey, buddy. Any hits on the mistletoe? No? - Still early. - Ha, ha. - Great bash, Georgie. - Yeah, yeah. Didn't realize you knew so many Asians. - It's like The Joy Luck Club in here. - I had a hard time scaring up guests. Most of them are from this dim sum restaurant. Do yourself a favor though. Try the juicy buns. Mm. - Hell, yeah. - Right? Out of this world, Mrs. Yee. Oh, hey, how's it going with the art teacher? Oh, really great. She's so uncomplicated, you know? In a good way. I think I finally broke the crazy-woman curse. - All right. - I'm sick. - What? - Did you have these? Send everyone home or at least anyone that looks like they have a weak system. Like Aimee. Okay, what's going on, Tess? Ls that what this is about? Aimee? I can't talk. I have to puke. I can't believe all flights are grounded. I'll be in my room. My room. So don't follow me, Yakult. - Maybe it's a sign. - I'll go call a travel agent. Mom, call Yakult! Oh, my gosh, George. You remembered. She's here. Zoe's here. Hey, hey. You have been acting weird all night. And borderline rude to Aimee. So, what's going on? I heard she doesn't support our troops. I've been trying to get rid of her. What...? Because you don't you like Aimee? I like her fine, I guess. - It's you who doesn't like her. - What are you talking about? You were crushed about your breakup. - Aimee's your rebound. - Listen carefully. I do like Aimee. I'm having this party so I can spend time with her. But you like Zoe. You only broke up with her because of me. - That... That's not entirely true. - But you couldn't eat tuna. You really gotta be in the mood for tuna. George. Help me understand what I'm hearing. The truth is I broke up with Zoe, not because of you... ...but because she's really, really annoying. And volatile. And negative. And a little bit of a slutty lush. Well, I hope you're in the mood for tuna. Ahem, hel... - Merry Christmas, George. Wha...? Oh. Uh... I hope George made his bed. Because it looked like he was gonna have to lay in it. - With her. - Hm. Yeah. - Or her. - Uh... Or, who knows, her. Uh... I'm so embarrassed. I thought you invited me because you liked me. Hold up, hold up. Please. - I do like you. - I thought you like, liked me. In a different way than you like the Chinese family. I like you in a much different way than I like the dim sum family. The Yees. So why were you kissing that loud woman? Oh, well, okay, I know it's poor form to blame your daughter for things... ...but this time it really is Tessa's fault. So will you please come back inside? I drive like once a decade. And last time was a moped in Jamaica. Sandals, half-sloshed on piÃ±a coladas. Heh, so, I mean, you can imagine how freaking terrified I was... ...driving to the middle of nowhere, face it. You know, at night? My hand to God, I thought I was dead, like 10, no 12... Twelve times. But I did it all for George. I did it all for love. Aw. Damn right, "aw." Now someone, anyone, point me to the drinks. Two chicks? You must have been good this year. Or bad. - Either way, two chicks. - I have no idea what to do here. If I tell Zoe the truth, she's going to make a scene... ...and sweet Aimee is gonna bolt from the coat room... - ...like a frightened rabbit. - George, I'm a dentist. I'm trained to give people bad news. It's what I do all day, every day. I'll talk to Zoe for you. The secret is in the soothing dentist voice. - I'm gonna need one thing from you. - What's that? - Soft rock. - I can do that. You son of a bitch. What are you doing with my buns? They looked a little dried out. I didn't want to embarrass you. Lisa? Have you been out here this whole time? It's freezing. I was out there waiting for you. Then your dad and Ms. Ainsley came. The way the like-likes were flying around, she could be your new mom. - My new mom? - Yeah. Your brain must have frozen. I'm gonna make you some hot tea. Tessa, I had some time to think... ...while I was out there, and it occurred to me that there's a reason... ...why you feel so guilty about coming between your dad and Zoe. - Do you wanna know what the reason is? - Lemon Zinger sound good? You know in your heart that you've come between him and other Zoes. Not true. George has dated, and I have known George has dated. I just haven't necessarily seen it before. - Oh. - Tessa, your dad's hot. Deserves some action. I'm gonna think over everything you just said but the last part. I'm not going to lie. There's going to be some discomfort. Even pain. But then you'll never have to worry about it again. Or you could ignore it... ...pretend like everything's good and healthy. But then you run the risk of things decaying further. Um... Where's George? Don't worry. Hey. We'll bring that smile back. Donk. Okay? Oh, Tessa, can you help me find my capelet? Okay. But I just wanted to say I think I overstated the mess... - ...that George leaves. - That's good to know. I'm serious. He's... He's practically tidy. Never leaves the seat up. Goes the extra mile and rinses down his toothpaste clumps in the sink. I swear. Look. I know the situation's really complicated. - Tessa... - Give it another minute, Ms. Ainsley. I will get you a glass of milk while you wait. - Thanks, Noah. You have a real gift. - Thanks for recognizing it. I can't believe I thought I was in love with George. I mean, you get past the good looks and he's got nothing. He is so not my type. I'm married. Married? You creep. Whenever I start to feel something. Whenever I start to feel... Dallas. Hey. I thought you weren't gonna be able to make it. Fate had other plans. Plus, they couldn't de-ice the plane. George. Thank you for the mittens. - I can't believe you remembered. - Remembered? That story about how my mother used to make me wear red mittens... ...so they wouldn't get lost in the snow. Oh, the fact that you remembered really touched me. - Oh. - It almost made me cry, heh. - Thanks, George. See you New Year's. - Thank you. Merry Christmas, guys. Thanks for coming. So the red mittens were kind of a stock present this year. - Gosh, I'm embarrassed. - What? No, don't be. You know what? I think, subconsciously... ...I remembered you telling me that story and that's... Oh. Dallas, are we, uh...? Uh, aren't we...? Oh. Lighten up, George. It's Christmas. Let me get this right. You invite me over here to hang out in some coat closet... ...while you make out with not one, but two women? George had a gift. A gift for making even the sanest women turn crazy. And good thing I wasn't thirsty. Because that milk never came! - Happy holidays, - Happy holidays, Damn, Mrs. Yee. You got it going on. Idiot! Zoe, please! - Listen to the sound of my voice. - You're an idiot! - Stop throwing snowballs. - I was a sure thing! Ow! Hey. I'm sorry I told you I broke up with Zoe because of you. It was just I didn't want you to be mad at me any more. I mean, you're really good at the ice treatment. Thanks. And I guess I shouldn't have snuck on your computer. - You should probably password-protect. - Will do. Well, I guess we both learned a valuable lesson. I'm sorry you don't have a special someone to share the holidays with. - What? Are you kidding? - Yeah, but I'm your kid. Don't you get sick of it just being the two of us? Never. That said... ...if there were ever to be a third... ...I hope you'd be able to embrace that person with open arms. I would. And vice-versa. Let's face it, George. I tried to help you... ...but with your track record... ...it's probably gonna be me before it's you.
