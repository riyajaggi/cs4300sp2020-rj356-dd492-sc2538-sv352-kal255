 All right, listen up. My CI says the heroin drop happened last night. Supplier rented an Airbnb to cut and package it. Three, maybe four guards. Be ready for surprises. Venice Beach. Gentrified. Houses stacked like Legos. No breathing room for us. Or mistakes. Day raid. People everywhere. SWAT's about saving lives, not kicking ass. * When I get high, I get high on speed... * What? Nobody thinks I listen?

Take it easy, you're safe. I promise you, you're safe. He's speaking Tagalog. There are a couple Filipino families in my church. Sir, you speak English? What's your name? Javier. Javier, are there any drugs in this house? No. Are you and your friends okay? Your lips look... We don't want trouble... Med pack! Man down! We need paramedics at the Venice op now! Deac, we're gonna need more than one bus. They got heroin inside of them. Any second, they could all end up like him. Sir, stay with me. Stay with me. It's okay. Come on, now. It's okay. How's he Doing? Javier is unconscious but stable. We're observing the others. Any we can talk to, Doc? I'd rather you wait until the drugs pass. I need them calm, not agitated. Even then, it's not a great idea. Hondo, Captain Cortez, this is Father Guzman. One of my staff called him. Let you know when I have an update on Javier. Thanks, Doc. What's your interest here, Father? These people are my pamilya. My family. Nothing's more important. I run the rescue mission at Trinity Fellowship in Filipinotown. Immigrants don't always understand their rights, get taken advantage of. I make it my business to help them. They won't talk to police. Are they scared to be deported? They're here legally, as licensed nurses. Then why won't they talk to us? The situation in the Philippines. The police there... People are dying. Or they paid for their trip here by swallowing bags of heroin. Someone forced them. Either way, the traffickers need to go down. These people can help us. That's your job. They don't have to help you do it. And that's your call? Sometimes you have to help those who can't help themselves. All right, Father. We'll be back later when they're healthy enough to talk. They can be friendly witnesses or they can be charged as drug smugglers. I'll let you explain that to them. What's the word on Javier? He's gonna make it. The others, too. Man, locking people up like that... Holding them till they pass the drugs. Takes a certain kind of animal. It's not the first time. Won't be the last. Detective Marcus wants to talk to you about this case. From Homicide? I haven't seen him since that task force in Pico-Union last year. What's he into that's got to do with this? I'm not sure. You gonna get that, champ? One sec. One of the girls from the roof? Nah, they were staring at me. An inmate from a Los Angeles County Correctional Facility... KAREN: Karen Street. is attempting to contact you. Will you accept this call? Yes. Jimmy, baby. Hey, Mom. Hondo. Congrats on the cush promotion. What do you need, Marcus? Homicide found three gutted Filipinos over the last couple of months. SLUGS thinks it was some sicko, but now I'm thinking it's connected to the mules you found. Hoping your loser could tell us something. The guard you guys caught, Viper Estes, lawyered up before he could hit the holding cell's bidet. Lawyer's no pushover. Nice suit. Yeah. He'll keep his client quiet. Our victims aren't talking, either. Heard you guys met Father Guzman. Spoke with him, too. He used to be a Sandista. Brother got killed by a cop, or something like that. Think he's involved? After his gang days, he found God or whatever. So, maybe. Any leads? Your mules, my dead bodies, were all Filipino nurses here legally. Only, yours were lucky you found them first. Mine... I think they were murdered because they couldn't pass the heroin, or maybe the bad guys just got impatient and cut it out of 'em. I hate people. Where do you want to start? If you're an immigrant and want to work legally in this country, you need a sponsor. Hi, Jimmy. Hey. Oh... I hope I didn't cause you any trouble with your new job. No, no, no. It's fine. I mean, we're on something. I-I, uh, I got to be back soon. Mm. It's good to see you. It always is. You, too. New paint? Uh, yeah. Some shrink told the warden lime green is soothing. What is he, in therapy? He should be. He's a little bit uptight. Oh, honey. It's okay. A few more months, it'll all be over. You shouldn't be here. Always looking out for me. Even with your father, you never would back down. I don't know where you got that. Not from him. You remember the time he came home drunk and started chasing me around with a hammer? You were right there. But he can't hurt us anymore, can he? We just have to keep moving forward. Um... ...when you called, you said it was urgent. Ye... Um. A friend of mine, Diedra Caldwell, she's getting out next week. Her ex is a hitter like your dad was. I just, I don't want to see her end up like me or worse. Look, maybe if her ex sees that you're a cop... I mean... I mean, if you could just warn him, tell him to stay away from her for good, you know? Is it wrong? Nope. Maybe it is. It is, it's-it's wrong to ask you. I shouldn't have called. I have no place asking you for anything. You got every place to ask me whatever you want. Jimmy, you don't owe me anything. I owe you everything. I chose to stay with your father when things got ugly. And you made the right choice in taking him out. I don't know. It was so long ago. Mom. Listen to me. No one was there for us. Neighbors, teachers, the mailman-- everybody turned their backs. Everybody looked the other way. We were alone. You did what was necessary. Okay? What's this guy's name? Baby, listen to me... What's his name? LUCA: Look, guys, you know how it goes. I need a place to stay tonight. So cut the suspense, tell me whose car to throw my stuff in. Not me. Sorry, Luca. I took him last time. Deac? No way. New baby. End of story. What's going on? Luca got kicked out of his apartment by his girlfriend. That's three in as many years. Yeah. Rule is: someone from the team has to take me in. Till he gets on his feet. What is that? Like, some kind of Bro Code? No, SWAT Code. Far more sacred. Wait, wait, wait. So, you break up, and the girls get your apartment? You need a new lawyer. Look, Street. I'm a good guy, all right? And I always warn them at the beginning, "If you expect me to settle down, forget it. I'm married to SWAT." They just never believe me. That's hard-core, Luca. Well, it's in my DNA. Three generations: my grandpops, my pops and me. Kind of a holy trinity. And just as badass. All right, listen up. Cortez's INS contact ID'd the nurses' sponsor. Robert Miller. What's the business? Employment agency. Recruits workers for nursing homes around town. That's a good cover. Deac, Luca, Tan, you're with me on the corporate office. What about us? Marcus is bringing some nursing home employees and residents here. He needs help interviewing them. That'll work. Maybe you can explain it to us, Mr. Miller. I run an employment agency in Santa Clarita. Not some drug operation. Sir, nurses you sponsored from the Philippines were used as drug mules and held prisoner. A few of them have died. I had no idea. That's horrible. Uh, look, my wife is Filipino. It's a travesty what's happening-- all the violence there. The people are desperate. I'm just trying to help as many of them as I can. By finding them work in nursing homes? Yes. I work with Filipino nursing schools to find people who are willing to care for our aging population. There's not a lot of people here who want to clean bedpans. For a green card, they'll do it. When you bring them over, what happens? You pick them up from the airport, you find them housing, what? No, see, I'm-I'm just the middleman. I-I file the permits, I do the paperwork. I never even meet them face-to-face. Who does? I hired this guy about a year ago, a recruiter. He speaks fluent Tagalog, and he's cheap. He's the one who manages the nurses when they get here. His name is Julio Arvado. Julio Arvado? Clear. No sign of him, boss. Got something. Condom balloons and duct tape. All the tools. Well, he didn't try very hard to hide the merchandise. All right, Tan, take pics, document it, but leave it all here. Yeah, don't want to spook this guy. Let's figure out where he is. Luca, we catch Arvado, this place will have a vacancy. Oh, yeah, sure. I've always wanted hep C. Admit it, Luca. You're a terrible houseguest. What are you talking about, Deac? Your kids love me. Yeah, well, you kept my son up all night playing video games. He slept through school the next day. TAN: You ran up my Pink Dot bill. Yeah, and Chris says that you ate everything in her fridge. Boss? No way, Luca. You're like a frat boy his first day away from home; I need sleep. Okay, my brothers. There are SWAT rules passed down from generation to generation. No officer left behind. So I have faith that one of you will come through for me before tonight. Arvado, man, it's Ross. Open up. Arvado's not here. Where is he? HONDO: What do you need? ROSS: Something good. How much you got? 20 bucks for a couple of bags. Come on in, man. I'm on a bad trip. No, you're good. It's nice to meet you, Ross, uh, Martin. Tell us all about Julio Arvado. He's got a couple old arrests for possession. Hey, send me that. I'm talking to a nurse manager at one of the homes. I'll see if she recognizes him. Mm-hmm. Meanwhile, you two can handle him. Retiree, James Traylor. Insisted on coming with said manager. Hmm. Quit flirting. Ask him out already. Hey, you treat 'em like family, like Hondo says. Come on. Sounds like a solo job, right? Listen, uh, I need you to cover for me, just for, like, a half hour. That's funny. Let's go. You're on the clock. I have an important errand to run nearby for my mom. I think you know her situation, okay? No. No. Hey, absolutely not. Text me if we're on the move. Help you, sir? Officer James Traylor, LAPD. Class of '65. Honor to meet you, Officer. You, too. You know, we're not the reason all the nurses at our home are scared. The police, I mean. Yeah? You got some information for me, Officer? Trey Smith? Yeah. I'm here about Deidra. What about her? Need you to stay away from her. For good. Understand? What's SWAT got to do with any of it? You hear what I said? Sure, Officer. Insurance. This a game to you? Business. Yeah? You stay out of mine, I'll stay out of yours. That what you call what you do with her? Business? Well, what do you call it, tough guy? You sure you want to talk to a cop like that? I don't think you're here as a cop. Just stay away from her. Or what? Or you'll regret it. Yeah? Where can we find Julio Arvado? Okay. Here's what we're gonna do, all right? I-I got to get out of here. I start work in an hour, but, um... Did-did Arvado leave any "H" lying around here? Or...? We're not dealers. Right, but there's got to be room... for some negotiation here. Yeah, this is Hondo. What? Yeah, yeah. Thanks. What? Street just got himself arrested. We got this. Go. Realized he's one of yours, Hondo. I thought it best to call. Thanks. Mm-hmm. So, what are we doing? You want to press charges? Make this a thing? No. What about you? Turn around. Get out of here. HONDO: We are hunting a human trafficker, a murder suspect, and you just up and leave your post? Street, I have been giving you rope. Plenty of it, because of Buck. But I'm not doing it anymore. This has something to do with the visit to your mom, doesn't it? Look at me. You got to pick one boat. One boat? You are a SWAT officer, or you are a loose cannon, your choice. Look, it was a favor to my mom. It was to protect a friend of hers. How was I supposed to tell her no? She's on my list now, too, because of you. Oh, crap. I really can't believe you signed off on this, Chris. It wasn't her fault. She tried to stop me. Oh, so now you want to be a team player? CHRIS: You're right, boss. I should have made him stay. It won't happen again. I promise. I found something on the trafficker, I think. All right, it'd better be good enough to get me out of my bad mood. What do you got? Retired LAPD heard a couple of nurses talking about Arvado. He's got something over them. It's the reason why they're afraid to talk. Kept saying "pamilya." Family. The traffickers are threatening your families, aren't they, Javier? Is this man-- Julio Arvado-- is this the reason why you won't talk to us? Look, if that's true, you can't help them a world away. We don't think they're in the Philippines. We think they're here. I called DHS on the way over, got some names from the flight manifest. One name is Paul Sanchez, 19. Same last name as yours. Is Paul your son? No police. Holding family members is a common tactic with traffickers. But if that's what's happened, you-you can't ask him... ask any of them to risk the lives of their loved ones. We're trying to save their loved ones. Father. Javier is scared. But you're the one who doesn't trust us. I had my reasons not to trust cops once, but one did right by me, changed my view. Give us a chance. Javier... This man, he divided us up. Said he would kill the others if we talked. Said he would kill my son. There's a second group of drug mules being held hostage. Six people. And we think Arvado has them. Javier said they started as one group in the Philippines. Armed men forced them to ingest the "H" before they boarded the plane to come here. Yeah, they arrived a couple days ago, Arvado splits them into two groups. Threatened that if anyone from one group called the police, a family member from the other group would be killed and vice versa. Keeps everyone nice and cooperative. Don't anyone from the missing group to O.D. like Javier. Yeah, or worse. What about Robert Miller? Can we get something else from him? We're reviewing his financials. So far, nothing. We might have something else. That tweaker from Arvado's house, Ross, said that Arvado's got a girlfriend: Leila Garcia. Works in Hollywood at Club G. LUCA: Yeah, we can talk to her. Good. Take Street. Chris, Tan, keep working the Miller angle. Let's get him this time. Let's move. At least you could have gotten away with whatever it is that you were doing. What? I should see the other guy? Hey, what happened to him? Hondo, I oversee this team. I'm his direct supervisor. After the times I've backed you? You want to go to the Man about who's in charge here? No. No, not here, I don't. Jess, I get it. Street is a new SWAT member. That's time, that's resources. I get it. Look, I want to tell you that the kid's worth it, I just don't know right now. I have no idea what he's going through. I could use your help finding out. All you had to do was ask. What do you need? * Hey, chica, hablas mi lengua * Come here and do your thing, ma * * Seen ya chillin' to the beat, I think... * Nobody else until these three. Ah. I got this. Luca, you know better. This is not the dress code. Alexander, L.A.'s personal stylist. I thought you were still working over at Cobalt. Too retro. Yeah? And this establishment's up to code. This, however, isn't. So sad. Now, you. You've got potential. Once whatever this is clears up. We're looking into a human trafficking ring. A guy named Arvado. We'd like to talk to his girl Leila. Ah, she's on her lunch break in the alley. All right, thanks, man. Arvado was in earlier tonight. He left about two hours ago. Did he say where he was going? Nah. He just pops in whenever he's looking to scratch an itch. Listen, this guy is bad news, okay? You don't want to be protecting him. Maybe I'm protecting myself. Look, we got a father who's looking for his kidnapped son. Arvado knows where he is. Well, my father was a drunk who was never around, so... sorry if I'm not feeling you. Arvado used you, too, didn't he? Hmm? How old were you? 15? 16? You supposed to care? They tell me it's my job. Messed up job. Yeah. Might not have it much longer. Yeah? Why is that? Uh, I, uh, I messed up today. Pretty bad. What do you say you help me go out with a bang? Hmm? One screwup to another. Arvado recruited me when I was 13. For sex. Well, now he's making people smuggle drugs. We think he's murdered some of them. I overheard him earlier today. He's got a big sale planned tonight. Unloading all of his heroin. That means he's got to go back to his house to get his stash. I'll call Hondo. Thank you. It's been over an hour. We play this out. Arvado's our link to Javier's son and the others. Let's get him easy, let's get him alive. Man of the hour. 12 o'clock. Let's go. Check him. Arvado's dead. (siren wailing) Where are the hostages? You get anything from Arvado's killer? Murdo Wick, hit man on the cheap. Murderer's name is Murdo? I guess his mama was psychic. Lawyered up like the other guy. Whoever's running this thing knows how to cover their tracks. That takes serious cash. Yes, it does. Nice suit. Just like the other guy. Okay. Same A-list law firm. Attorneys for the guy we grabbed at the drug house and Arvado's killer? Question is, who's paying the bills? Our middleman Robert Miller's bank statement. He paid that firm a retainer fee. Arvado was the recruiter, but Miller was the money. He used the nurses as a pipeline for the heroin. I'll get a warrant. Hondo, something else. Trey Smith, the guy Street got into it with. Yeah. You want me to... No. No, I'll deal with it. Why risk your career for him? I've been there, Jess. Not with SWAT, just... Things can grab ahold of you and make you feel like you can't trust anyone. Until you learn to again. I'll let you know when we get Miller. Is my husband in some kind of trouble? We need to talk to him about murder, heroin and human trafficking. So, maybe. Is this a joke? I swear, Mr. Miller isn't here. Well, where is he, then? I don't know. He left a couple of hours ago. Trust me, I would never lie to SWAT. You know, you got all the moves in the field; people like you. Seriously, if you'd stop shooting yourself in the foot, you'd be really good at all of this. I know. At least you're humble. Hondo, he's not around. All right, thanks. Your husband's not at the office. He's not here, either. Yeah, nothing. Nope. Where is he, ma'am? This is a mistake. Robert would never... He's a good man. And these things... a-and to my people. It's not possible. His name is Paul. His father Javier brought him here for a better life, and now he's missing. Your husband knows where he is. Robert has a private cell, just for me. Why don't I-I just call him? Show you that you're wrong about him? Just ask him where he is. Put it on speaker. Hello. Robert? English, Mrs. Miller. At the country club. Uh, sorry. Y-You're breaking up. Where? The country club. Drinks with some investors. Thought I told you. Okay. I'll see you when you get home. I love you. Love you, too. See you soon. What's the name of the club? Valencia. Let's go. See, I told you. This is all just a big mistake. My dealer's dead, I got a bunch of immigrants with heroin inside 'em, and I go out for drinks at a country club? Miller thinks he's untouchable. Also has the means to hire firepower, a hit man. We find him, watch yourselves. Yeah, you don't want to end up looking like Street. Can't miss that face. What happened to him? He piss off the wrong retiree? I wish it was that simple. Your husband's neck deep in all this. Why should I believe you aren't? Detective, I'm going to help you with everything. Can I make us some coffee, tea? No, no. Do you two have any other properties? Not that I know of. Does he have a storage locker, safety deposit box? We have a home safe, uh, for paperwork, passports. If there are any other properties or storage lockers, the information will be here. And how much do you two discuss business? Marcus is conscious, but he's in rough shape. Paramedics made it in time. Listen to me, we need to find out where the Millers are headed. We're raking the office. Come on, now, we got six missing immigrants. Our only leads are on the run. We'll find something. Check this out. Hang on. Numbers, flight coordinates. Pilot's logs. Hondo, Miller's a pilot. Looks like a Cessna. Want us to alert the airports? No, wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on. When Adele called her husband, she said something like "San-see." So? San-see. SAN C. That's the call tag for the Santa Clarita Airport. All right, we're on the move. Were you followed? No. Get in the plane. Go, go, go! Don't do it! Tell me where the nurses are right now. Get off me! Stop! Stop! I said stop! Robert, don't say anything. Look, this was never supposed to happen, not like this. You just wanted to make some easy money. I-I didn't even have to be involved. I just find the nurses jobs, and Arvado would... Shut up! Look, she's the one who introduced me to him-- Arvado. You listen to me. You both are gonna go down for murder. Now, here's where you get to decide who gets it worse. Where are they? I'll tell you. You... Luca. Pamilya. Pamilya. Pamilya. You're safe. Your family is safe. Get 'em out of here, go, go. There you go. I got someone here who's gonna be really glad to see you. Hey. Let's get them some water. Thank you for finding him. Be well. Let me just get you over here. I want to get him checked out, okay? You changed some minds today. Sometimes you got to take care of those who can't take care of themselves. All the time. Okay, all right, thanks. I don't want to lose this job. I'm gonna need to see some improvement, then. You will. I'm not gonna let it go without punishment. I know. What am I looking at? You got to let Luca stay with you until he finds another place. That doesn't seem like much of a punishment. Trust me, it will. Oh, there he is now. Luca. Yo, what's up? You're bunking at Street's. Ah, just under the wire. I thought I was gonna have to get a hotel tonight. I knew you guys would come through. Hey, Street, you live near the beach, right? Uh... You got a board? Uh... No worries. I got an extra one. Best waves are at 5:00 a.m. You got Xbox or PlayStation? PlayStation. Beautiful. You pick the game, I kick your ass, buddy. STREET: We're gonna get some sleep at some point, right? Who are you? Name's Hondo. I work with your son. Oh, Jimmy? Mm-hmm. Is he okay? He's fine. Have a seat. Um, is he working out? The-the job, I mean? He's got the makings of a good one. You have no idea what he's had to overcome. I'm really proud of him. You tell him I said so, okay? Karen, your son's not gonna visit you for a while. You had me. Yeah? Yeah. I thought you were serious. I'm thinking, "Did I do something wrong? Is Jimmy mad at me?" You are a real player, aren't you? I'm not letting him get played anymore. What? The guy you sent your son to meet, Trey Smith, he's your go-to for contraband. Phones, cigarettes, pills. That's the type of stuff that can give you a lot of control over what goes on in here. Only, he's been selling to another inmate-- Deidra-- probably because she's willing to give him a bigger cut. You have no idea how hard it is and the things that you have to do to survive. You used your son to send a message: "Stay away from the competition." Jimmy wanted to help me. Oka-- I-I need to talk to him. That's not gonna happen, not after I tell him the truth about you. Who do you think you are? Black guy, hot shot, sitting here, talking to me like this? You mean nothing to him. You really think he's gonna trust you over me? I saved that little ass of his. I am here because of him. Wow, lady. You are a piece of work. I wondered how Street could be such a mess, but now that I've met you, I just got to wonder how he managed to turn out so good. I'm sorry. I-I-I... I know that you're just trying to help, and you're right about all of it. Just, please don't tell him. If you care about him as much as I do, you won't, 'cause it'll crush him. Don't call him anymore. You mess with him, you're messing with me. My family. Captioning sponsored by CBS Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org
