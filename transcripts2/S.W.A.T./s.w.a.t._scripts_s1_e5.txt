 Where are those breakfast bars? Uh, the kind with sugar, or the kind without sugar? I thought neither of them had sugar. One kind has sugar, but it's organic pure cane sugar, so... Is that even better for you? So... where are they? Uh, which kind? SWAT! SWAT! Get on the ground now! Move! LAPD! LAPD! Get down! This is a mistake! Promise. You have the wrong house! On the ground!

 This is a mistake! Put your hands together. Get down! Get over here. On the ground. Get down and shut up! Go upstairs and get the stuff. Go! Why-why are the police stealing from us? Because they're not the police. You-- what's your name? What's your name?! Desiree. Desiree. Desiree, give me the alarm code, or we kill your dad. It-It's six, seven, one, eight. Desiree, is that the right code? Yes. Is that the right code?!

 Do I need to kill your dad to show you I'm serious? No, please. Please, please don't. It's the right code! It's the right code! Thanks, Desiree. You did the right thing. You know what? You seem like an interesting girl. Let's you and I... No. No. No, no, no. ...go have a talk, huh? No, no, no, no, no, no! Get off! No! Just tell us what you want! No! Don't take her! Don't take her! Please! Just tell us what you want! Help me! Help me! Please! Hey, it's probably just another false alarm. Uh, sorry to bother you. We got a noise complaint about... House belongs to Donovan and Trisha Watson. One child-- 17-year-old girl. Looks like a home invasion. Unis got the house surrounded. The bad guys might still be inside, or they might have taken off on foot after shooting the security guard. Either way, we have to assume they're all still inside. Be ready for anything. You awake, Street? Shoot anything that moves. Got it. Be ready for anything. Metro SWAT! LAPD! Metro SWAT! Kitchen clear. Go. Dining room clear. Luca clear. Chris out. Tan out. No! Leave my family alone! Street? I got him. Police! Put down the weapon! Put down the weapon now. How do I know you're really the police?! Ma'am, we are the police. We're Metro SWAT. Just put down the knife and step away from the girl. Mom, it's okay. It's not them. They kept yelling "police" and "SWAT." Why wouldn't we believe them? We're working with Robbery- Homicide to track 'em down. Now, any details, no matter how small, can help us find them. Well, I don't know what to tell you, except that they were... they were dressed like you guys, except their faces were covered. Well, what about race? Or height or accents? Um, you know, it was all a blur, really. Maybe your daughter got a better look? No, she saw even less than we did. You said you were zip-tied? Yes. You saw them. They were right over there. But then they cut you free? Um... Desiree set us free. So they cut her loose? She slipped out of them. She's small. She slipped out of them? But they were cut. Then she must have cut them. And why were her zip ties in another room? Okay, this was all very terrifying. How much longer will the officers be here? A few hours, ma'am. Wait. You're staying, right? Uh... EMTs are getting packed up if any of you want to change your mind about getting checked out. No. We're fine. Something happened in there. They don't want us to know about it. You thinking sexual assault? I really hope not. Sure feels that way. In which case she needs to be convinced to get medical attention. Get a counselor up here? When that girl saw Chris, she knew we were the good guys. Hey, there's already a connection there. I'll talk to her. High-end jewelry like that's gonna be tough to unload. You sound like you have an idea. I got some buddies who buy this kind of merchandise. You're buddies with jewelry fencers? Not exactly fencers. Let's just say they work in the gray area. All right, the less I know, the better. Go. Don't make me regret it. What if he had come at us with a gun instead of a golf club? I was thinking the same thing. The last thing we need is citizens taking shots at us because they think we're the bad guys. Somebody's gonna get killed. We should check with the SWAT uniform vendors. There's only a couple in L.A. How are the victims? It's hard to say. They're lying to us. Like they don't want us to catch whoever did this. Insurance scam? Donovan and Trisha Watson. They both have their own businesses. Maybe one of them got caught up with the wrong kind of people. We'll look into their financial situation. Chief wants to be updated on this one, so when you know something, let me know so I can tell him. I'll check with Robbery-Homicide. They inside? Mm-hmm. (garbled radio transmission) Big boss getting his hands dirty? Look around, Deac. It's Brentwood. You two have that protection detail today. Yeah, I was hoping we could, uh, stay on this. You know, maybe one of Mumford's guys could take it. Yeah, I second that. They've got Homeland Security drills through the end of the week. I'm sorry, guys. This comes from the top. We'll make do. Hey, Hondo. Lady here runs a private security firm that patrols the neighborhood. They notice anything out of the ordinary recently? Nothing big, but she said there's a couple in the neighborhood-- Jake and Tiffany Kemp-- asked her just last week if she offers a premium service. 24/7 security against home invasions. You get the Kemps' address? I read an article. Said these kinds of things were on the rise, so I looked into upgrading our security. That's all. Oh, just in time, huh? They said they don't offer the services I asked for, but I found someone who did. We noticed. Two armed men outside of your house 24/7. It's a little overkill, don't you think? Apparently not, given what you say happened down the street. You hire protection for home invasions, and then, a week later, you have a home invasion in your neighborhood. Something must have spooked you. Suspicious people driving by, a threat of some kind? Like I said, I read an article. An article. Right, yeah. I wish I could help, but I'm late for work. Did something happen to your door back there? We're doing some remodeling. These people seem to have a thing for high-end jewelry. Would you happen to have something like that in your home? Nothing worth taking. Hey, look, I-I... I know you guys are just doing your job, and I don't want this to come off as rude, but all I did was read an article and hire security to help my family. That's not a crime. The same thing happened here as at the other house. Doesn't make sense. Somebody kicks in the door and ties up my family, I'm begging the police to look into it. The Kemps' daughter looked about the same age as Desiree Watson. They might know each other, even if the parents don't. Chris, I got something for you. Okay. Yeah. Got it. They find them? Not yet. Do you know the Kemps? They live a few streets over on Langham. No. They get robbed, too? We're not sure yet. They have a daughter. Laura, your age. Do you know her? No. What? It's... nothing. It's just... um... this kind of thing shouldn't happen to anyone. No. It shouldn't. Whoa! Way to go, way to go! So, which one's our guy? You don't know who Bobby Strock is? You don't follow hockey? No, I never got into it. "Never got into it"? How have we never had this conversation? Look, I know it's your thing, but I don't want people trying to force me to like stuff I'm not interested in. But you get why people want to kill this guy, right? Yeah, he injured one of our players last month. You might have mentioned it once or twice. Yeah. Justin Montgomery. Justin Montgomery-- he knocked him out for the season, on a dirty hit. It could cost us the playoffs. Officers Kay and Luca? Yes. Hey. Brian Mobley. Bobby's agent. Good to meet you. Thank you so much for helping us out. Well, V.I.P. protection's one of our main responsibilities. We saw the letters he's receiving, I mean, memes online burning him in effigy. Imagine that. Oh, let me guess-- hometown fan? No, I'm just a fan of clean hockey. Hey, maybe it was an accident. Full-speed, blindside elbow to the head? You watch it in slow motion and tell me that's an accident. Well, it's a rough game-- injuries happen sometimes. Hey, Bobby. LAPD SWAT-- awesome! Luca. Hey, guys. Deacon. Sergeant. What are you, 20-David? Uh, 30-David, actually. Dude, it's an honor. You must have some massive stories. You seem to know a thing or two about SWAT. Oh, yeah. If I'd have known I'd get to hang out with you guys, I would've tried making enemies a long time ago. These are serious threats, Bobby. From a bunch of serious losers. Can't wait to hear some badass takedown stories. My cell's on here. Call me if you need me. Off the record... he's a little off. Even for a hockey player. I promise you, Ms. Webb, we are leaving no stone unturned. That's why I brought you here, Lacy. SWAT is LAPD's best and brightest, and they're all over this. And we always welcome a visit from a member of the city council. Then, SWAT should be the ones protecting the neighborhood. LAPD already has metro crime suppression platoons assigned to your area. If SWAT is the best, I want SWAT officers doing the patrols, every day until we find these people. LAPD's already using more resources on today's home invasion than on a double murder last night in South L.A. Having money doesn't buy you special treatment from the police-- not from SWAT. Well, I'm sure that's not what Lacy... I'm not looking for special treatment, Captain Cortez. I'm looking for the exact treatment that you should be providing everywhere. It's not my fault if you're providing substandard treatment to South L.A. But that doesn't mean we have to accept it in our neighborhood. Treat everybody better. Well, we've made our request. Now let's let Jessica get back to work, and I'll follow up later. Thank you. You sold the guy four of these SWAT outfits? Guy bought four complete sets-- boots, helmets, uh, the whole kit and caboodle. Look a lot like the real thing. We pride ourselves on the authenticity of our police and military uniforms. And of course, you check customer I.D.s, keep all the necessary records. Well, I mean, things move fast. If someone wants to buy a police uniform, they'd have to show you a letter from the department saying it's okay. If they have a department insignia on the uniforms, yeah, but these don't say "LAPD," they just say "police." Well, congratulations on following the absolute minimum letter of the law, Felix. We make every effort to ensure our customers need the uniforms for legitimate purposes. The guy you sold these to used them to terrorize people in their homes. I don't want to hear about your "every effort." Right now I want to hear every detail you remember about the guy who bought 'em. He said he was making a Web series. I-It's L.A. Everyone's doing that. Can you at least describe him? Uh, he looked, uh... like the type of guy who makes a Web series. One of my fences has some guys in his store right now trying to get some high-end stuff appraised. On the west side? Mm-hmm. Let's go. Said he's gonna stall 'em. How? Didn't say. G-Good luck. You guys can't leave! That's my guy, the one with the shotgun. Street, take care of your boy! Will, Will, Will! Put the gun down! Tan! This is 20-David in pursuit of suspect. Westbound in east/west alley off Santa Monica and Kelton. Three other suspects headed east and north through same. We need an airship. Hey! Gun! Come on! Go. Hands on. Go. Go. Looks like the stuff stolen from the Watsons this morning. Airship's late responding. Nobody's got eyes on the other suspects. Well, at least we got one of them. You gave it a good shot, though! You're lucky it was them that got you instead of me! Guys think 'cause I don't wear a suit that I'm some kind of fence-- I'm just new kind of legit. Hey, chill out. Bring it down. This new kind of legit involve functioning security cameras? Yeah, sure, but I outsource, you know, so the footage goes on the cloud. I mean, I could get it in an hour, probably. You said these four have been here before? Last week. I bought some nice pieces off them, real nice. Nothing on any theft reports-- I checked. Because you're not a fence. Exactly. They said they'd be back with more, too. When? Just before I pulled out the shot... No, no, when did they say they'd have more jewelry? Tomorrow. They said they'd be back tomorrow with more rocks. Sounds like they have another home invasion planned. Think they'd be dumb enough to do it again so soon? They might be desperate enough-- we just scooped up their profits from this morning. That jewelry you bought off them last week, I'm gonna need that. All of it? Can I get a receipt? You know, um... I've been doing this a while. The cop thing. And you start getting pretty good at figuring out when someone's not telling you the whole story. I'm not lying to you, I promise. When I was 15... ...some guys grabbed me while I was going to the gas station to get cheese puffs. And I love cheese puffs. They, uh... they were the East Valley Pasas, and they thought I was this other girl who was dating the head of the Sirois Street Mafia. They had me tied up for hours... ...before they figured out I wasn't her. Hours... under their control. And, uh... I was... really scared for a long time after that. Scared to go to the store. Scared about everything. And I was really mad at myself for not getting over it. I just kept saying it. I just kept saying it in my head, "Just-just-just get over it," and I... How did you? I didn't. But that's when I figured out I didn't have to get over it if I could just look it in the face and-and then control it, instead of letting it control me. Desiree... those men this morning... ...did they hurt you? Did they touch you? Rape me? No. They didn't. I swear. * Don't call me all the time, it's no way to behave * * If you're not gonna call me by my name * * I can't say that you're mine * But I've got so much to say * You're stubborn * Concentrate, I'm trying * I should have stayed away * Call me by my name * My name... What took you so long? What are you doing? Packing up? We got another job. You crazy, bro? They got T.C. So we do it without him. The last two went perfect! This isn't a can't-miss thing anymore-- you get that? One more job. Okay? We're talking at least a hundred grand. Buys enough product to expand into three different clubs. Gordon, you're better than T.C. anyway. You can take his spot, and I'll do my... Stop smoking your supply! This isn't about expanding the business anymore. This is about our pictures all over the news from that jewelry guy's camera. We got to run, man. So let's at least get some more money to run with. Nah, bro. I'm out. Me, too. * Why we don't do it like we... * We're doing this next job! Together! * But if you're not gonna call me by my name * * Don't call me all the time * It's no way to behave... Okay, good practice, boys. Let me put in my teeth and we can grab some brews, talk SWAT. Uh, no, the itinerary we have is that we're taking you back to the hotel. Plans change. It's not like I'm a prisoner. And with you guys watching my back, I'm safe anywhere, right? All right, let's see what your agent has to say. Come on, guys. Grab one beer. I know a kick-ass bar near here. Call. All right. Be right back. You heard him. He wants a lawyer. We know if he had any connection to the victims? Watson family's never heard of any T.C. Fleming. Leads on the three friends? T.C.'s been busted a couple times for possession. No known associates. We got security footage on the other guys coming any minute. We're gonna run that by the families. "Families"? Plural? Yeah. Didn't the Kemps ask you to leave 'em alone? These punks are doing crimes dressed as SWAT. Every second they're out there is another second the public second-guesses this uniform. We go where the case takes us. Well, of course. I mean, we want these guys found. But, you know, just handle with care. Just like it says on the label. I heard you pulled a copy of the department's budget earlier today. Is that because of that woman that Councilwoman Baliss brought in? I thought she was gonna push for special favors, but she surprised me. Yeah. Actually made me think. Regarding what? Whether I'm part of the problem or the solution. We've gotten so used to the way things are that we forget to ask if they have to be that way. She's right. We should do better. By everyone. Well, everyone I see here is busting their butts. We've got a team in Brentwood and two officers protecting a hockey player while two murders in South L.A. are still unsolved. You know, when I first started, I was gonna change the world, too, Jessica, but these situations, they're like political hot potatoes. Just throw this woman a bone, get this councilwoman off our backs. We caught one of them, which means we're closing in. We're gonna catch the other three. What then? Then it's over. You're still scared. Why? The guy you caught, if he had anything on him when you arrested him, what happens to it? You mean the jewelry? No, I-I mean, like... like his phone. What happens to that kind of stuff? Oh, anything that he had on him at the time of his arrest is in police custody now. So, you don't give it to anyone? Not his lawyer? No one? Desiree, what... what's in his phone? Whatever it is, you're strong enough to face it. After they tied up my parents, two of them took me upstairs... ...and they started videoing me on their phones. They made me take off my clothes. And... they told me that they would kill my parents if... if I didn't talk on camera about... the dirtiest thing I'd ever done. Or the dirtiest thing I'd ever thought about doing. So I did. And then they said that... ...if we did anything to help the police, that they would put it online, so if anyone... Googled my name, like colleges or employers... ...it'll follow me forever. Hey. The "Jake and Tiffany Tenth Anniversary" inscription makes me think this all might be yours. You want to get real with me? The other family that got robbed, the robbers made a video of their daughter. I just want to protect my girl. The best way for you to do that is help us catch these guys so they don't do anything with that video. Or do what they did to your daughter to somebody else. I'll help you. I won't let it happen to anyone else. I didn't know his name, but I've seen him at Hardline. Hardline? It's this little club near UCLA. They don't look very hard at your I.D. Do you recognize any of these guys? Um... Wait, that's... Cash. Cash is his name? He deals Molly at Hardline. Cash is bad news. I try to stay away from him. Sounds like Cash and T.C. were scoping out rich girls at this club. Which means the next target could be somebody that you partied with at Hardline. Is there anybody Cash and T.C. paid special attention to? The only girl I know who's there every weekend is April Bagley. Is she a friend of yours? We go to school together. Cash definitely has a thing for her. April Bagley. Does she live around here? I think so. I-I met her at a party. I've never been to her house. It's okay. We'll find it. Before Cash does. Thank you. I know you've been through a lot. Whoa. Is that Bobby Strock? Seriously? What is this, man? Skate-around was tough today. Made me thirsty. This really isn't getting me into hockey. You suck, Bobby! Get out of here! MAN 3: Get out of here, Bobby! Whatever beer you have on tap, barkeep. Get lost! We don't want you here! Call yourself a player? You look like a damn giraffe on skates. And a couple ginger beers for my friends. WOMAN: Get out of here... MAN 4: You suck! MAN 5: Suck it, buddy! Weak-sauce fans for a weak-sauce team. You got our city on your uniform, you're protecting this jackass?! Pick a side! Yeah, pick a side. I might kill him myself. Look, I know Cash and T.C. Okay, they wouldn't hurt me. They hurt your friends pretty bad. Yeah, but if they wanted to rob from me, they could have at any time. Wait, they've been to your house before? A few of my parties, yeah. Where are your parents? Oh, my mom, uh, is in Ibiza this month with her boyfriend. And my dad lives in New York with his boyfriend. So you're here alone? Yeah, but, listen, okay, Cash isn't gonna come after me, uh, and I'm hanging with some girls tonight. So maybe you guys want to stay and watch the place and I can go stay at a friend's? You're gonna have to cancel your plans, April. Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! Time to go. Come on. I didn't even get any SWAT stories yet. It's not really a conducive, uh, environment for storytelling. Ha. Hey, these fans could use a good story after my team breaks their hearts tomorrow night. In your dreams! Bunch of donkey fair-weather fans. Say that again, scumbag! That's far enough. I said stay back. Get off of him! Patrick, you okay?! Down, down. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Got no right! Get your hands off him! Get off of him! You guys ever been to Rhyner's on Sunset? It has this salad with, like, pears in it. So epic. Not much of a foodie, I guess. Mm. You're like Virgil, my mom's last boyfriend. He was from Texas. All he ate was, like, steak. Probably on his third heart attack by now. HONDO: Back of the house is locked down. Once the other units get here, we'll have eyes on the whole perimeter. Okay. Well, all this food talk has me starving. So do you guys want anything from the kitchen? Think we're good. (garage door opening) Don't need your purse to get food out of the kitchen. Where you going? Oh, I... I thought I left my phone charger in here. I guess... I guess not. 85%. You want to try another lie? If I check this phone, am I gonna find the videos Cash made of Desiree and Laura? What the hell did you do, April? So, Cash sent me some videos. I mean, it doesn't mean that I knew about any of this ahead of time. "Some videos"? April, these were movies of your friends being humiliated, naked, at gunpoint. If you weren't a part of it, why didn't you call the police when you saw them? I thought it was maybe a prank. Laura's such an attention whore. I didn't know. You don't get how these girls suffered? How they suffered? I mean, I don't remember anybody crying for me when a picture that my best friend Desiree took showed up on the slut board in the guys' locker room. Then she tries to tell me it wasn't her fault. Bitch, please. And if Laura doesn't know what she did... then she deserves everything that Cash made her do in that video, and more. You planned these home invasions, had Cash make those videos, over a grudge? I didn't plan anything. We're pretty sure another one is about to go down. Now, if you tell us where, maybe we can get you a deal. Deal for what? I didn't do anything. Did you get ahold of my mom yet? She's gonna take care of all this. I had no clue she was still mad about that. It wasn't my fault-- lots of kids had that picture. None of this is your fault, Desiree. This girl is a total psycho. It's like she's not living on the same planet as the rest of us. Same planet, different tax bracket. Probably never had to deal with the consequences of her actions. All right, girls, you heard April. I'm gonna need your help again. Who else might be on her hit list? Laura, what about that thing she just said about you-- that you'd know what you did wrong? I don't know. I seriously thought we were cool. Are you the same Laura that Corby was flirting with? That was months ago. It seems like April has a long memory. Who's Corby? Corby Davidson, April's ex. He hit on me at a party once when they were still dating. Nothing happened, though. But he broke up with her the next day. She still bitches about it. Sounds like Corby could be next. And April saved him for last. Who knows what she's got planned for him. Do you have Corby's number? Yeah. All right, Chris, you take home, I got cell. It's going straight to voice mail. Busy signal at the house. Phone's off the hook. I can't find it. You what? I looked right where you said. I'll do it. You watch 'em. Oh, no. Oh, no. What do we do? You guys are gonna teach me those takedown moves, right? I could use those on the ice. You do know that there's nothing funny about this, right? They got what was coming to them. Yeah, unlike you. Oh, come on. You know, if I had your talent, and got to do what you did for a living, I'd have a little bit more respect for the game. Instead of acting like a jerk. What position you play? What? You're a player, aren't you? Yeah, I played defenseman. Where'd you play? In college. You get drafted? Nope. Wasn't good enough. Bet you still skate, though. Yeah, I can hold my own. So you get it, then, right? It's about the action, the juice. You probably wish you were on the ice with me. Sometimes I wish I was with you guys, out on the street, kicking ass. What you guys do isn't a game. I knew you could take anybody in this place. I just wanted to see it. Hey, guys from the home invasion crew barricaded in another house. All hands on deck. Let's go. Oh, I got shotgun! No, no. No, you're not coming with us. Oh, okay, fine. I'll just wait here and talk to my new friends. Come on. Let's go. Come on, hurry up. You guys have an extra vest or am I good without one? You joking right now? All right, you know what, Luca, I think there's one in the back, there. Dude, come on! Hey, two minutes in the box. For what? For being a pain in my ass all day. I can watch the back door or something. Like you said, Bobby, this isn't a game. Please let us go. If... if you, if you let us go... Shut up! What do we do, surrender? You want to go to jail? Huh? I'm not going to jail. We-we kill the dad to show the cops we're serious. Have them get us a car so we get out of here. Please, no, no! I said shut up! What is that? What is that? Metro SWAT! Deacon, right side. Right side clear. Left side clear. Upstairs. Deacon out! Luca out! Give me a two! Get down! Get down, down, down! Down! Down, down! Down! Please. Please. We got one! Yeah. Yeah, that's right! Your ass is going down. SWAT, fool! Is that Bobby Strock? Yeah. I hate that guy. Survivor's gonna give up April. Says she and Cash met at a club. They started hooking up, he wanted money. She wanted revenge against the girls and her ex. So she told him where the parents kept the jewelry, and all she wanted was them on film. Who turns teenage grudges into home invasions and humiliation videos? Well, I can remember more than one teenage grudge in my hood that led to a drive-by. Same mentality, just... different weapon. We found the videos, by the way. They won't get out. Good work. Your mouth is saying "good work," but... your eyes are saying something else. Want to talk about it? We caught these guys in less than a day, but that double murder in South L.A. is still unsolved. And nobody there has called to complain. City councilperson isn't barking down your door demanding answers, huh? So you're wondering how do we improve a community so used to being overlooked that they don't get outraged by it anymore. Something like that. And you're telling me you haven't solved that yet? I mean, come on, you've had, what, a whole eight hours? Seven hours and 42 minutes. You got a councilwoman on your ass and I got suburban dads coming after me with a golf club. That's one hell of a day. But it's over. The only SWAT out there is real SWAT. At least take a minute to enjoy that victory. We're gonna change things for the better, Jessica. Together. And we're just getting started. Just once around the block. You can't drive the truck, man. Do I have you guys tomorrow, too? One more day. Yeah, well, tomorrow, I think maybe I can make it up to you. It's not about the self- defense aspect for me. It's more like therapy, I guess. I just get lost in it, and I leave my pain in the bag. All right, remember what I told you-- just feet solid on the ground. Punch, don't push. Okay, now picture those guys and really hit it hard. Come on. Jab... the right. There you go. It's fun. Harder. Yes. * You might think * I'm coming to the brink * I guess we'll see * If I keep it all together now... * See you got the message. I almost didn't believe you, but okay. Get 'em, Deac! Yeah, Deac! Knock 'em on their ass! Yeah, Deac! This is crazy. * The lines drawn, so... Here they come, here they come. There he is, there he is. There he goes, that's our bo... Oh! Oh! That is not okay. * Bring it on, bring it on Ha! Now, this is getting me into hockey. Yeah, Deac! Proud of you! Captioning sponsored by CBS Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org
