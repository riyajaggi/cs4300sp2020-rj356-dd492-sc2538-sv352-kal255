 There you are.

 What the hell is this?
 Just smile and nod.
 We'll talk afterwards.
 In the course of responding to
an attack on two police officers
 last night, the SWAT unit
 to my right killed four
suspects and rescued a family
 who had been carjacked.
 Well, sadly, a 17-year-old
young man, Raymont Harris,
 was accidentally shot
and seriously injured
 by team leader, Buck Spivey.
 Now, this morning, I
terminated Sergeant Spivey.
 SWAT demands the highest standards,
 and Angelenos have the right to know
 that actions have consequences.
 Sergeant Harrelson, would
you please join me?
 Today I am assigning
20-David designation,
 the senior SWAT sergeant
and command of this unit,
 to Sergeant Daniel Harrelson,
 who exhibited immense
bravery under fire
 to prevent last night's incident
 from becoming far worse than
what it otherwise might've been.
 So, please join me
 in congratulating Sergeant Harrelson
 on a well-deserved appointment.
 Good work, gentlemen.
 Hicks made the decision
himself this morning.
 And he thinks
 promoting a black man on
live TV is gonna fix that?
 JESSICA: He thinks it's
better than doing nothing.
 Come on, Jess.
 The people there can see right
through this kind of BS.
 They know the difference
between a press conference
 and what really goes
down on the street.
 How many times have you told me
 there's a better way
to do things here?
 Treat the community like
family rather than the enemy.
 Now's your chance to prove it.
 He doesn't want my ideas.
 He wants a mascot.
 He's giving you a team.
 What you do with it is up to you.
 Deacon was up next.
 Deacon is a good man.
 You lead, he'll follow.
 All right, until I
can figure out a way
 to get Buck back on this team,
 give me Rankins.
 You're getting Jim Street.
 Who is Jim Street?
 Transfer from Long Beach.
 So now I got to break in a new guy?
 We're starting you slow.
 Hicks wants you at the protest rally.
 Starts in an hour.
 Thanks.
 Crowd control. No.
 I want to be out there
trying to get the guy
 we just lost last night.
 The gun dealer you caught
last night, Yorba Glennon,
 was selling weapons to
the man who got away.
 Doesn't know his name.
 Okay, so we'll look into it.
 Mumford's team is running point.
 You're gonna give
Mumford the good lead?
 And me community relations?
 You know I'm not that guy.
 If anyone can bridge the
gap between that community
 and the police, it's you.
 (GRUNTING)
 Buck got boned big-time.
 How do we fix this?
 They can't just fire him
 without having done an investigation.
 They just did.
 And Hondo's great and all,
but that job's yours, Deac.
 I mean, all the years that
you put in and waited.
 - I mean, you earned it.

 Buck got screwed more than me.

 Depends on the night.

 and Raymont Harris is my cousin.
 Raymont's a straight "A"
student at his high school.
 Last night, picking up some groceries,
 a cop shot him.
 This is the third police shooting here
 in the last six months.
 You don't see them shoot

 Moving too fast?
 I was trying to get to the
shooter before he got away.
 By running through the middle
of the park with no cover?
 I got here before
anyone else, didn't I?
 Lesson one, Street.
 Never be in a hurry to die.
 (SIRENS CONTINUE WAILING)
 Dead cop. Dead civilian. Both white.
 Someone knew what they were doing.
 Expert shot, line of
sight, escape route.
 Best we could do from
security cameras.
 No I.D.
 We know the shooter's
black... racial payback
 for the Raymont Harris shooting.
 MUMFORD: Robbery-Homicide found some
 unusual shell casings.
 Might track back to the sniper.
 Best lead we have.
 Couple different ways I can
think of to track that down.
 Coordinate with RHD, take point on it.
 You bet.
 Hondo, your team will pick
up any spillover duties.
 At least until there's
another press conference?
 These are outstanding
warrants for felons
 in a three-mile radius
of the park shooting.
 Coordinate with South
Bureau's Gang Enforcement.
 Start knocking some doors down;
I want to see what oozes out.
 I want to make that neighborhood hurt.
 HONDO: Those are proud people
 who usually get the
short end of the stick,
 and you want to make them hurt?
 They started a war with us, Hondo.
 Black on white. Maybe you noticed.
 So we're gonna squeeze 'em,
until someone tells us
 who did this. Clear?
 - Crystal.
- Pick out the promising ones,
 give the others to Hondo.
 Don't come back empty-handed.
 Be careful, but be quick.
 We already had a bank robbery
we couldn't respond to
 because of this shooting.
 Hey. Guess who's in the locker room.
 Get out of here, Hondo.
 You don't want to be around my stink.
 We're gonna fix this. I'm
gonna push Hicks and Cortez.
 This is not the end, Buck.
 Stop. All right, it's over.
 I was chasing a white suspect,
 end up shooting an unarmed black kid.
 - Not exactly protocol.
- It was an accident.
 Not one that I would
tolerate on my team.
 Buck, this is wrong.
 Look, you and Jenny,
come over the house,
 I'll make that gumbo you
like, and then we'll...
 Jenny... Jenny left.

 How come you didn't say anything?
 Because I wasn't looking for sympathy.

 It's your job now.
 This is some job.
 Hicks got me running around,
just smiling for the cameras,
 and now he sandbags me and puts
this Street kid on the team.
 I asked Hicks to put Street

 Why? What do you even
know about the guy?
 Yeah, I've been watching
him for a while.
 I think he's got potential.
 I can't be here to help him,
 - I'm-I'm hoping you will.
- I got enough troubles
 without trying to get
this kid over the hump.
 Here's a dirty little secret.
 I had no idea what I was
doing half the time.
 You know, I mean, I think the key was
 to not let you clowns realize it.
 Don't run the team the way
that I would. Be Hondo.

 Needle-in-a-haystack time.
 Hey, we don't write the

 HONDO: There's no Daronte.
 Boss!
 STREET: Check it out.
 That's Daronte
 with our two guys from
Hook and Go Towing.
 And that's the guy Buck was
chasing the other night.
 This is all connected.
 - TAN: How?
- HONDO: I don't know.
 But Street, Tan, grab Deacon,
 get down to that garage. Go!
 This rooftop.
 Chris, where the hell is this?
 That's downtown by 4th and Fig.
 All right, let's move.
 HONDO: What'd he say?
 Not much. Our gunrunner
Yorba confirmed
 he was selling weapons to a
group of ex-military guys.
 No. Something doesn't add up.
 Why is a black guy
threatening black schoolkids
 as payback for two white
people that he killed?
 Daronte and those guys
 from Hook and Go were
discharged from the Army
 after posting online about
overthrowing the government.
 They bought the guns
from Yorba's crew.
 When Raymont Harris
 gets accidentally shot,
 they take advantage of all the anger.
 Drummond shoots the two
people at the rally
 to get this city to turn on itself.
 This isn't racial.
 It's political.

 CHRIS: What was his plan?
They can't shoot
 - any schoolkids from here.
- So what's the target?
 Get me through, get me through.
 Left side clear.
 TAN: Right side clear.
 Room clear.
 "And the dead officers are
proof of your stupidity.
 "The money we took from your
bank will go towards destroying
 the corrupt system you
foolishly worship."
 Dead officers?
 I don't think we were
supposed to find that yet.
 Let's roll out.
 Hondo.
 They're planning on
taking down some bank.

 Is that Mumford and his guys?
 Yeah. What the hell?
 Cortez!
 What's 50-David doing downtown?
 There's a silent alarm
at First Finance Bank.
 Mumford's team was the
only one in the area.
 Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
 Didn't you say there was
a bank robbery during
 the rally shootings and most of
the cops in the city were there?
 That's right.
 And now there's another bank job.
 And all our cops
 are watching the schools.
 These are the same guys.
 It's an ambush.

 Luca's department champ,
 three years running.
 That's the easiest money ever.
 Better luck next time, Long Beach.
 - Anyway.

 Congratulations, Luca.
 Here's your cut.

 Where you going?
 Nobody likes the boss messing

 Hey!
 Good work today.
 I'm out. All right.
 Have a good one, boss.
