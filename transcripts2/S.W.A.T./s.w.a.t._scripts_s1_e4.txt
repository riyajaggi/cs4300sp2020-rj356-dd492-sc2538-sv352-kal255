 Previously on SWAT... All right, I want you to fill the gaps, stay liquid. - You with us, Hondo? - Fill the gaps, stay liquid. You say it so damn much, Buck, I finally got it tattooed on my ass. - (LAUGHTER) - All right, here we go! - (SIMULTANEOUS GUNSHOTS) - (PEOPLE SHOUTING, YELLING) 17-year-old young man, Raymont Harris, was accidentally shot and seriously injured by team leader, Buck Spivey.

 Now, this morning, I terminated Sergeant Spivey. Today, I am assigning command of this unit to Sergeant Harrelson. I asked Hicks to put Street on the team in my place. Jim Street. This is wrong. It's your job now. - You have plans tomorrow night? - (LAUGHS) You know, actually, um, I was thinking about asking this woman that I work with out to dinner. I'm just not sure what she might say. Maybe she's not into it. (LAUGHS) Please.

 - Oh, she's into it. - Oh. - Trust me, she's into it. - (LAUGHS) It's just, um, she's my boss. - Ah. - I know. - Sounds inappropriate. - No, it is. We have to keep the whole thing a secret, we can't be seen together. You know, all that stupid stuff. - Might be tricky. - Mm. Or it might be kind of exciting. Where you going? Hey. What, are we playing hide-and-seek? Happy anniversary. Anniversary? Our 13-week anniversary. - What? - (BOTH LAUGHING) Okay. 13 weeks? It's no big deal. I just... I just saw it, wanted to get it for you, so I did. (SIGHS) Baby, it is a damn nice shirt. I know. (LAUGHS) Yeah, of course you do. There. You look very handsome. Hmm. Give me a decent head start to Deacon's, okay? So it doesn't look like we're arriving together. All right. Spot you what, five minutes? Make it ten. ♪ ♪ (GLASS SHATTERING) (CAR ALARMS BLARING) ♪ Lean on me when times are bad ♪ ♪ When the day comes and you are down ♪ ♪ In a river of trouble... ♪ Matthew's tooth is hanging by a thread. Already? Been looking all over for you, Annie. Congratulations to you both. Oh. Oh, hey, thank you. - Where's the baby? - Oh, Grandma's putting him down. Baptism was a bit much. Although he did a lot better than our last two. Yeah. Kid's tough. He's definitely SWAT material. - Oh, hey, over my dead body. - (LAUGHS) Hey, you seen Hondo here yet? No. I'm sure he's on his way, though. Why? You'll see. Oh, speak of the devil. HONDO: Hey, Annie. - Hi. - How are you? Okay, everyone, gather up. - Gather up. This way. - MAN: Hey, everyone, come around. - Good luck. - Huh? - MAN: Come up front. - CHRIS: Gather 'round, everyone. Where are we going? What are we doing? - Oh, no, no, no, no. - Oh, wow. Yup. - HONDO: Wow. Okay. - LUCA: All right. - Yeah. Oh! - MAN: Yeah. See? Okay, the bad news is there is no Jackass of the Month to hand out today. But the good news is there's a Jackass of the Year! - (CHEERING AND WHOOPING) - Okay. This month's infraction was a doozy, because one of our own was pictured very prominently in the Sunday papers. - (BOOING) - On the front page, - above the fold! - (JEERING) Ladies and gents, it is my distinct displeasure to present Jackass of the Year to, uh, shameless media darling Daniel “Hondo” Harrelson. (JEERING) Come forward to receive your punishment. MAN: This way. Anything you'd like to say? Yeah, I got something to say. Y'all are fired. - (LAUGHTER) - I would not like to thank the photographer who took this picture. And to the newspaper that published it, I curse you. And certainly no thanks to Annie and Deacon, our ungracious hosts. (WHOOPING, APPLAUSE) - (WHOOPS) - Hey, but seriously, um... (LAUGHS) I never asked for this job, you know? But... I couldn't be prouder of this team. ♪ Hold on, I'm comin'... ♪ - (ALL BOOING) - Punishment! (CHANTING): Punishment! Punishment! Okay, we need a picture for the wall of shame. I think Hondo's got a new girl. Why is that? Well, don't tell me he bought that shirt for himself. I mean, that's a woman's touch. (LAUGHS) I haven't heard about anyone new. Hey, um, I know Deacon felt passed over when he wasn't made team leader. How's he holding up? You don't have to worry about my husband causing a problem. How are you doing? Look, I know it's tough, being a cop, but... sometimes I think it's tougher loving one. I thought Buck was coming today. - Yeah, so did I. - Hmm. - Have you talkedto him lately? - No. - Not in a while. - Hmm. (PHONE BEEPING) - Sorry. - Yeah. Everyone, you're all about to get it. (PHONES BEEPING) Come here. You know the drill. I got to go. You take care of Mom. - Okay. - Okay, come here. - (GRUNTS) - (LAUGHS) What about you? You gonna take care? Piece of cake. Okay, you be good. - Ooh. - (LAUGHS) I'm sorry to leave you with the mess. Ah. What I get for planning a party when the team's on call. How about we go check out that tooth, huh, Mister? - Okay. - (INHALES SHARPLY) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (GARBLED RADIO TRANSMISSION) Deacon, Chris, - get these people back. - Roger. I need two uniforms right here. LUCA: Guessing this wasn't a gas leak. The gas lines are intact. This one's for the bomb boys. Hey, what are we looking at, Reggie? Detect any explosive materials? Yes, sir. From what we're finding, this place is practically a bomb-making factory. So there might be more of these already out there? Street, techs haven't cleared that yet. Yeah, I hear something. Is somebody in there? Hey, hey, over here, over here. I need help over here. We got a survivor. Bring me that gurney. Luca, we got to get this thing up. - All right, careful. - On three. One, two... three! (CREAKING, MEN GROANING) We're right here. Hey. Hey, I'm Hondo. What's your name? Maya. I was vacuuming inside my apartment. I'm having people over tonight. Why am I outside? Okay, no, no, no. Look at me. Look at me. I need your eyes. Keep your eyes on me. I can't feel anything. Is that weird? No, no, no, that's not weird. That's... That's normal, Maya. MAYA: My whole building is gone? Are the guys next door okay? (PANTING) What happened? We're gonna find out. These people are gonna take care of you, okay? (GARBLED RADIO TRANSMISSION) STREET: Pretty big explosion. Yeah. And this might just be the beginning. ♪ ♪ - Synced and corrected by martythecrazy - - www.addic7ed.com - STREET: That's a lot of lead-acid batteries. How big an arsenal did this guy have? Go introduce yourself to Reggie. - See what elsehe's finding. - Reggie? He's the lead bomb squad operator, the big guy. Go ahead. Everybody loves Reggie. Hondo, this is Agent Conley, point for the FBI. Eileen, Hondo. He's our newest SWAT team leader. - One fatality? That's confirmed? - Just the bomb builder himself. - Adam Jarrett, 24. - HICKS: Still don't know if he made any others before this one, though. Or what he was planning on doing with them. CONLEY: Well, we have our suspicions. Adam made our watch list last month, surfing pro-jihad Web sites. We found this in the wreckage, too. Published in Yemen. Any extremist connections to anyone here in L.A.? Unknown. Could be a lone wolf. Either way, there are a few doors in the Muslim community we've been wanting to knock on. This gives us our opportunity to do so. SWAT's here to assist. Well, the survivor from 2A, Maya... She asked about “the guys next door.” This Adam kid might not have been working by himself. Well, he was the only one on the lease. We'll check out our watch list most likelys if you can look into Adam's local contacts. Let's keep talking. We're here to help. Okay, great. Hey, listen up. These high-end batteries... No more than a dozen stores in L.A. sell 'em. Let's find a record of that purchase. - We're on it. - Street, you're with me. All right. We're gonna continue your education today. Hey, Maya. Do you remember us? Doctors said I would've suffocated if you hadn't found me when you did. Are you cops? Metro SWAT. I talked to your doctor. She's optimistic that you're gonna be fine. I've never had surgery before. STREET: Don't sweat it. Surgeons at this place... - They can do anything. - WOMAN: It's time. Okay, Maya, I just have one question. At the explosion, you asked about the guys next door. Was there someone else living with Adam? I don't know if he lived there, but he was always around. Kyle or-or Kevin. Maybe Kenny? I was worried that maybe he was hurt, too. I just don't get it. Adam seemed like a normal guy. Why would he do something like this? I don't know. Maya, you're gonna be good. Okay? (PHONE CHIMES) Hey, Street. I need you find a ride back to HQ. What happened to continuing my education? This is someone I got to talk to, alone. (DOOR OPENS) Hey, Hondo. Haven't seen you since the fantasy draft. What place you in? I think you know the answer, Tarek. - Second to last? - Dead last. Just wanted to hear you say it. (CHUCKLES) See you, ladies. I got your text. Saw the bombing on the news... wanted to help. This guy's a homegrown terrorist? Possible. Too early to tell. Hmm. People say it's, uh, faith versus faith. But that's a lie. It's decent people versus barbarians. Show me who your suspect is... I'll ask around the mosques, see if he's been around, - if anyone knows him. - I was hoping you might say that. - His name is Adam Jarrett. - White kid? I know. Now, he may have been working with a friend... if this is true, - we're very interested in finding out - who he is and what his connection to your community might be. I learn anything, I'll let you know immediately. You always do. Thanks, Tarek. I've been busy in your absence. Found the store that sold our bombers high-end batteries. Farm & Garden in Shadow Hills. - We need to get that to the FBI. - Already did. Did you have the store run his name through - credit card purchase logs? - Did that, too... Chris pulled the last three weeks of checkout line surveillance. Any sign of Adam? That's Adam buying eight chrome batteries and a hell of a lot more ammonium than was in that apartment. That would have taken out the entire block. So there are more bombs still out there. Yeah, but the good news is, we got some pictures of the accomplice... Haven't ID'd him yet, but whoever he is... Just became our top priority. All right, Street, whatever they were planning, Adam going boom is gonna make his buddies speed things up. - We need a name. - Working it. There he is. - Thanks for swinging by, Buck. - Mm-hmm. - Missed you earlier at Deac's. - I didn't want to make it awkward. Nobody wants to talk about me getting the heave-ho. Don't worry about it. You're my guest. Hey, listen, I've been, uh, meaning to ask. That kid I shot... Raymont... You ever... you ever hear how he's doing? Yeah. I've been looking in on him. He's back on his feet, Buck, way ahead of schedule. That's great. That's great. Mm-hmm. You know, I've been wanting to reach out to him, but the department's lawyers said until a settlement's negotiated... Listen, do you think he would ever let me tell him how sorry I am? I'll ask Raymont and his mom when the time is right... I'd be happy to. - Great. Thanks. - LUCA: Hey, Buck. Hey. What are you doing here, man? I'm not, uh, I'm not really sure. I was hoping you could take a look at something for me. - Come on. - Come here. It was no half-assed pressure cooker, was it? This kid knew what he was doing. We think he may have finished a few these before he blew himself up. Street's trying to ID his buddy right now. All right, I'm on it. Later, Buck. Don't be a stranger, okay? - See you, brother. - So listen. Once we get a name on the second guy, I could use your expertise... What do you say? What do I say to what? Help me out? Just for the day, off the record. Come on, you and I both know I'm poison in this building since the shooting. You're probably gonna get a reprimand - just for walking me through here. - Hicks won't care as long as he gets the credit, and you know that. Come on, Buck. You've secured more explosives than most people in this room have ever seen. It's never about the bombs, right? It's always about the guys who make them, and they're all the same. How's that? Nobody's pushes a button until they stop feeling human. And I just kept 'em human. (CHUCKLES) I see what you're trying to do here. You're trying to... trying to make me feel useful. - Buck... - Yeah? You got screwed, man. No hearing, no review. Come on. That's 100% Hicks trying to cover his own ass. I could still use you here. I'm not gonna be responsible for you getting fired, too. Now, you got this. I'm gonna beat it before, you know, people start thinking this is a thing. Listen, I, uh... I never rooted for days like this, but, you know, chasing them down before they did any more harm, they were always my favorite. Thanks Hondo. Good luck. LUCA: Hey, time stamp on the photo matched a debit card swipe... we got a name. Cross-referenced his image with the DMV. Second guy in the photo with our bomber, his name is Kevin Lynch. If he spent lots of time in that apartment, - he's a real threat. - He might be the ringleader. And he has his own place. We're headed there now. - What else do we know about him? - Attended Cameron College with Adam. Dropped out a month ago. DEACON: Listen up. Good chance he's - sitting on more bombs. - What's up, Hondo? DEACON: Watch every step. Hondo. Take this guy down, but be careful, okay? Piece of cake. STREET: Hey. Buck was here? Yeah. I didn't get to see him. Is he coming back later? I don't think so, Street. (SIRENS WAILING) (LAUGHING, WHOOPING) Eyes ahead on the cross-traffic. ♪ ♪ Clear! - (BOOMING EXPLOSION) - STREET: Whoa! (TIRES SQUEALING) Reggie says it's ammonium nitrate packed in there with C-4, same as earlier. Also says he can't believe no one died. If Kevin's waging jihad, he's not doing a very good job. You got something? The building security cameras. Kevin called in a bomb threat just a few minutes after he dropped the backpack in the second floor lobby. - (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) - (SIGHS) Who are the other tenants in the building? Investment firms, med firms... Metzler Financial, Dwyer Capital, Sherman & Ross. Why bomb this place? Agent. The kid called in a bomb scare - to clear the lobby. - I'm aware. But wouldn't a terrorist be going for the highest body count? Not all terrorists think alike. All those doors you've been knocking down in the Muslim community... You get anything? Related to this? No. All due respect, Agent, I've been going down that road with you, but look around. This place was not a target of opportunity for Kevin. This was Kevin executing his plan... a plan that's - not exactly screaming jihad to me. - Okay, you might be right, but my bosses want me to keep going through our watch list. (SIGHS) So where are you guys on tracking Kevin Lynch? We were on our way to his home when this happened. I doubt he'd be stupid enough to go back there, but we still need to see what we can find. Okay. Just keep me apprised. - Hey, Hondo. - Yeah, what'd Reggie say? He got anyone free to sweep Kevin's place? No, he needs his technicians for another couple of hours to sift through the rubble. Yo, Reggie! I need you to open up your toy box for me. Better not break it. Let's go. HONDO: Kevin may have left this place rigged, so keep your eyes peeled. Fan out around the perimeter in case this place goes up. Got the tree side! Who's getting eyes on that garage? How about the new guy? Fine with me. Go. No one's home. - All clear. - DEACON: Fall back. Andros is going in. STREET: Where'd you learn to operate these? Celtics-Lakers. 2008 Finals. My unit had to sweep the Staples Center for explosives, so... I got certified. (CREAKING) (DOOR SQUEAKS) - LUCA: You guys got a visual? - Roger that. There's something planted in here. It's booby-trapped. The place is gonna go up. - Along with any evidence. - Stand by. Hold on. Might be able to put the fire out. Andros must have tripped this fail-safe. It's crude, but it's impressive. The kid didn't want us to find anything in here. Boss? Found a term paper cowritten by our first bomber, Adam, along with Kevin... do you think this is something? - Paper for what? - Camden College, Poli-Sci 433. It could be, but I still think we're missing something. Keep looking. Luca. Could we try it my way now? (SIGHS) All right, that works, too. CHRIS: Guys, listen to this. “When institutions favor the haves over the have-nots, “violence may not just be an expected outcome, but a certain one.” Chris, Street, get down to Camden College and see what you can find. Be quick. Go. You guys keep digging. Neither of these young men was an academic standout. Although they both got As in that class you mentioned, Poli-Sci 433. I read their paper on the way over... intense stuff. I'm familiar with the anger in that class. Students in there made the last year of my life a nightmare. They organized a protest against the renaming - of our business school. - What was their beef? Didn't like that a $50 million donation was going to create “more capitalist pigs”" Those protests got ugly, violent. - Any punishments? - Some suspensions. Adam and Kevin got reprimands on their records. Of course, the actual ringleader - suffered no consequences at all. - Who was the ringleader? Their professor, Marc Lasky. Whipped them all up. - What, he didn't get fired? - Our donor's been all over us to find a way to get rid of him, Lasky's got tenure. He'd have to murder someone for us to fire him. Do you know where we can find Lasky? He holds office hours for another 20 minutes. I can show you where. After the news broke about the second bomber, didn't take an hour for a brick to get tossed through. I'm sorry, Tarek. We're exhausting every angle we can to find him. Nobody's seen either of your guys around the mosques. The FBI's kicking people's doors in. I know they've got a job to do, but do you really think these white American boys are Muslim extremists? I don't. Yeah, well, it'd be nice to see that on the news, too. Yeah. (PHONE RINGING) I'm really sorry about your window. Thanks. Yeah, Chris, go. What'd you find? That class was a staging ground for some violent protests, and the professor that taught it was right in the middle of it all. Lasky's supposed to be at his office - right now, but it's all locked up. - I'm listening. The donor who funded the college's business school is one of the board members here, and apparently he's been trying hard to get Lasky fired. Name's, uh, Fred Dwyer. As in Dwyer Capital? Looks like it. Why? The building that got bombed... Dwyer Capital rents half the offices on the second floor. That business school's the next target. Chris, get down there and start evacuating. That's Hondo. We have to get everyone out. Come on. Get out of the building. Get out of the building. - Everybody out! - LAPD SWAT, out! Get in, drop it, and get out. I know, Professor. You told me. Twice, actually. But that didn't stop you from phoning in a bomb threat. Blowing out windows won't get people to wake up. I said I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Be strong. LAPD SWAT, everyone out! Everyone out! Out! Out! STREET: Move, move, move, move! Move! Come on, let's go! - Come on, move, move, move. - Second floor covered? Every room. Rest of the team should be here any minute. LAPD SWAT, everyone out! Everyone out! Out! - LAPD SWAT, move, move! Everybody out. - Out, out, out! - Come on, everybody out. - Hey! You need to evacuate. Hey! Hey! Do you hear me? Kevin! CHRIS: Eyes on the suspect. Eyes on Kevin Lynch in the Dwyer building. Possible bomb in his backpack. Kevin! Get out of the room. Get out of the building! Kevin, stop! - All right, nobody move. - LAPD SWAT. - Get down. Everybody out. - (STUDENTS SCREAMING) - Hey, get back. - Kevin, drop the backpack, buddy. I need to see that backpack, okay? He's got a bomb! He's got a bomb! Move out. Everybody out, everybody out. - Out! - Get out of here - right now! - Put your backpack down. - Let's just keep it calm, okay? - Calm? As soon as I let go and these two sides connect, this entire building and everybody in it goes down with me. You're not gonna do that, though, are you? Everyone paying attention, class? - Kevin, you're not gonna do that. - Hey, you! You! - Sit down! - Down, down. Anyone else leaves, everyone dies. Just keep it calm, okay, buddy? - It's all right. - Kevin... - put the backpack down. - Get out of here. You want to speed this process up, hero? Get out of here. Okay, we're going. We're going, okay? It's all good. Just keep them apart, okay? Don't do anything stupid. Just keep them apart. We're going. CHRIS: Take it easy, Kevin. Kevin, don't do anything stupid. Hang tight. Stay with me, Kevin. Don't look at me. Get down. Get your face to the ground right now. (TIRES SCREECH) CHRIS: We've evacuated everyone not in the classroom. Street, did you check those bathrooms? Twice. All clear. Evacuate yourselves as soon as possible. - You hear me, Chris? - Copy. Files on all 12 students trapped in that room. How far away is the FBI negotiator? Agent Conley said 15 minutes out, maybe 20. Well, looks like we got a new negotiator, then. Classroom has an auditorium-style layout. It's 15 rows, three sections, each 20 seats across. - Windows out? - Nope. - Internal windows? - They're on the door, but it's the size of a cereal box. Anything? We need to deactivate Professor Lasky's badge as... No. Leave it. Have them call you if it pings anywhere on campus. He says he won't wear the bomb suit. You can't go in without the suit. There's 12 kids in there who don't have that option. I'm gonna do better talking with him man-to-man, not looking like the Pillsbury Doughboy. Let's wait for the FBI guy. I'm certified in negotiations. You know that. I've watched Buck talk guys away from their explosives plenty. You don't have to do this, you know. The only thing I know is the perfect guy to disarm this kid is sitting on his ass in Northridge because you fired him without giving him a chance to defend himself. - What has Buck got to do with this? - He's who we need here today, but we don't have him because of you. You could've just suspended him, but no, you fired him because you wanted to do what's good for you, - not what's good for the city. - No, hold on. Otherwise, we wouldn't be in this position right now. You done? You think I enjoyed watching his career end like that? I begged him to fight it. Buck insisted that I fire him. He had shot an unarmed black kid who looked like he was about to die. Buck knew the city was about to explode. He didn't want to make it harder on the rest of us. It was Buck's call. Not mine. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) I know you don't respect me. I never said that. Never had to. But if you ever say that I don't care about this city or the officers who work for me again, you and I are gonna mix it up. Lasky's access badge just pinged at the faculty parking structure. You and Luca. Go. Hondo, you be careful. You might just get that promotion after all, Deacon. Yeah. Hope not. STREET: Come on, let's go, let's go. Move, move, move. Move, move, move, move, move, move. - These are the last of the kids. - Hostages' positions? Behind their seats in the first three rows. - And where's Kevin? - 11 o'clock when you first enter the room. But he's pacing around, muttering. Something's really off with him, Hondo. Yeah, no kidding. All right, both of you, get the hell away from this building. All right. LAPD SWAT. Get out of the building. Go. KEVIN: Hey. Hey! Hey, what are you doing? Get out of here! I-I will. I will. Once I know everyone in here is safe. I'm Hondo. Cool to call you Kevin? KEVIN: Yeah, that-that's what everyone calls me. What the hell do you want? I want to know what you want. Kevin, I need you to listen to me. You have a student in here. Her name is Maria Quinn. She's a diabetic. She really needs to get to her medicine, Kevin. Jesus. Okay, hey. Hey, how about this? You let Maria go, and I'll take her place, and you and me, we can talk. (LAUGHS) Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's what you want to do. You ju... y-you just want to talk. Yeah, well, I don't feel like listening. I just want to make sure we all stay safe, Kevin. - Oh, “we”? - That's right. Look around. We're all in this together. Which one of you is Maria? Me. - I-I'm Maria. - Kevin. Look at her. She's sick. She needs her medicine. - Just let her go. - Oh, God. Okay? Just her. Okay. Come on, Maria. Come on. Get outside. Go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where... What the hell are you doing? I'm keeping my promise. I said her for me. As soon as I drop this thing, we're all dead. (STUDENTS WHIMPER) So go ahead and shoot me if you want. HONDO: No. No, I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna shoot you, Kevin. I'll put it away. I want to help you end this peacefully. Yeah, well, this doesn't - end peacefully, okay? - Why not? I mean, it has to be really important that you're willing to hurt all these people. Kevin, these are just kids. You don't even know them. Yeah, well, would I rather take down a room full of billionaires? Sure. But trust fund babies studying to become those billionaires? Well, that's the next best thing. These kids? They're your problem? (SCOFFS) They're not my problem. Monopolized wealth is my problem. The one percent is my problem. Greed is my problem! I mean, look at this. - I mean, just step outside. - (STUDENTS WHIMPER) The world is burning down and nobody cares! Oh, and these criminals at the top, they think they're gonna get away with it. Why? Because they always get away with it. Right? Well, not this time. 'Cause we're gonna wake people up. (STUDENTS WHIMPERING) KEVIN: We're gonna show them that the whole system is rigged. Okay, I get your goals. I do. But violence is the solution? Explain that to me. Uh, it commands people's attention when nothing else works. I mean, come on. You're a cop. Man, you must see injustice every day. The powerful abusing the weak. The rich riding the backs of the poor. Man, there's people born on the wrong side of the tracks and then they're blamed for living there?! You don't have to tell me about being born on the wrong side of the tracks, Kevin, because I still live there. But most people work hard and they do their best to climb a notch, just so, one day, God willing, they can sit on a porch somewhere and just enjoy it. That's all these kids want. And I got to believe that's all you want. Isn't it? - (PHONE RINGING) - gasping) Yeah, Professor, man, uh, where the hell are you, you know? You-you kind of left me here all alone. LASKY: Kevin, we're in this together. We're almost there. - Our negotiator's outside. - Too late. Now, listen to me. Listen. I am so, so proud of what you're about to do. HONDO: No, don't listen to him, Kevin. He's the one who's pissed off at this college. Ask him why he isn't standing here instead of you. Who is that? He doesn't know you. He doesn't know what it's like to sacrifice for something greater than himself. The price that we've paid. Come on, Kevin, he's playing you. You're the one who's paying that price. Don't listen to him. You can't trust him the way you can trust me. Kevin, look at these kids. Where's Lauren? Lauren Moss, where are you? (SNIFFLES) I'm-I'm Lauren. Lauren, you're not some trust fund kid, are you? Tell Kevin why you enrolled here. My mom's restaurant, it gives her all the bad shifts. And so I thought maybe I could help her buy the place one day. Kevin, we agreed. We agreed to change the world together. Remember, Kevin? Hey, Paul. Paul. Where's Paul? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Could you just, please... Okay. Just-just back up, okay? Kevin, I want you to listen to Paul. Your parents pay for college? No, they, uh... they didn't go to college. They wanted to help, but they can't. Kevin, finish what we started.
