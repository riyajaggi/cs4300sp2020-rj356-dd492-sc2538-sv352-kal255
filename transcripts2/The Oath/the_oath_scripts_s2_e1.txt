 [grunts] [tires screeching] Let's go! [chains jangling] [speaking Spanish] What about the money? As soon as he's a safe distance from here, you'll both get what was promised. - [siren blaring] - Hammond, we gotta go! [tires screeching] [siren blaring] - [grunts] - Right now! Right now! [theme music playing] Don't give me that look. I turned a shit situation into a pay day. A job as dangerous as this is worth more than just getting that gun back. Deal was we break him out. Why are we still with 'em? Until he lands somewhere safe, the job's not over. What the fuck... Must be an accident. We got a possible issue in the number three lane. Yeah, I see 'em. - [Steve] Think they do? - Let the other cars know. [Ramos] Two in front, one in back. [horn blaring in distance] [phone vibrating] Heads up. We might have company. [Carmen] Let the Ravens handle this. [horns blaring] Eyes. [horns blaring] Tell Steve it opens up once we get past this truck. Go! [Eli] Get down! Get down! Don't move! [screams] Son of a... Shit! [Carmen] Get everyone to our father! [gunshots] [Eli] Target the third SUV. - [gunshot] - [grunts] Get out! Get out! Move out! [gunshots] [Eli] Get up! They got Cole! [Eli] Nobody move or we shoot him. [screaming] Who the hell were they? - Ramos. - Yo. Check with dispatch and make sure nothing from that freeway - is leading the field units back to us. - Copy. The rest of you get over to the street fair and socialize. Make sure they see your face and remember you were there. Listen... this wasn't about the money. No! We needed that gun back and now you've muddied the waters! All right... so I got them to sweeten the deal for a couple hundred grand. And why not? The club needs the money. You're being played. We can't do this. [panting] You were voted out four months ago. Your dad is sick of this shit and fucked off. So I run this now. Not you. We just gotta find the pricks that took Ignacio... and then we can get their father back. Hey... I'm just fixing what you fucked up. ♪ Man, take a look We done came far ♪ ♪ The transition from the ghetto to an acclaimed star ♪ ? From nothin' to somethin' Who'd ever thought that we'd evolve? ♪ ♪ Amass four cars Properties and summer homes ♪ ♪ Travel the seas First class and motor homes ♪ - Come on. It's for the community, people. - Thank you. Hey, we got a bogie at our nine, Carl. Hey! Alligator arms. Free to the public only. You better find a way to reach those pockets for a donation if you take that goddamn burger. - Put it on my tab? - I ain't running any tabs. Good. Because I wouldn't pay it, if you were. Save that smile for Kraley. He's the one you gotta impress, not that prick. All right. [Carl] Let's go, folks. [Beach] We should've known that shit was gonna go south. Look, I don't like it anymore than you do, but Kraley's in charge. Now, you making yourself noticed like Steve said? Without pissing people off. We're the good guys, remember that. - Hey, how's it going? - Hey. What can I get you, ma'am? Uh, well, this little man would love a burger. Well done. OK. Well done, coming right up. - Here you go, little man, well done. - Thank you! You're welcome. And what about mom? You need anything? Oh, he's not mine. Oh, good to hear. Excuse me? No, I meant... just nice to know. You know, that's all. If the two of you are done, the rest of us are hungry too. - Name's Amber. - My name is Cole. And I'm single. I'm just saying, Amber. All right, bye now... I'll take mine well done. Oh, man... what you did right there, man, I mean that was a straight up block. You know that? - A block? - Yeah, a block, you know what I'm saying. No. I'm not quite sure I do. And since that's my daughter we're talking about, why don't you explain it to me. - Hey, uh... you got a sec? - What? Y'know, anything you need, I got you. I'm down for the Ravens. - OK. - I mean it. Hey, leave the man alone and go flip some burgers. Yeah. - What the hell was that? - She wants ink. You don't just come out and ask it. - She knows that, right? - Yeah. - [grunts] - What? My back. - Man up. It's not that heavy. - I've got a blown disc. - Then get it taken care of. - I am. Going next week. Yeah? Make sure your replacement's better looking than you. I just want to thank you and the station for participating in this. No worries. Just our way of showing we support the community. Do you? Because I still hear stories in the neighborhood about people being jacked by cops. - Jacked? - [Pastor Greg] Profiled. Stopped and searched without probable cause. Excessive force used on them... Should I go on? Change starts with dialogue. And that's why we're here, make sure that both sides see each other as people, not stereotypes. And all the money goes back to the community. Specifically, your church. And we appreciate that... but some would say that money isn't a Band-Aid for a generation of abuses. [clears throat] Then we'll just have to keep doing more, won't we? I sincerely hope you will. [Kraley] Colombian friends want to talk. [Kraley] If they wanted him dead, they would've killed him on the spot. Someone's gonna call and ask for a ransom. I'll put money on it. Yeah, that's why we're here. Maybe you already know who has him? What does that mean? They knew he was being broken out, and only my men got shot when he was taken. Bullshit. We had nothing to do with it. None of our people talked. - They're both lying. - Stay the fuck out of this. You gonna make him, marica ♪ [speaking Spanish] We want him back. No questions asked. We don't know who did it. You don't know? I will pay five million if you find out who did, and bring him back to me. [speaking Spanish] Make it ten. [laughs] No. How do we know you'll pay up if we do find him? [speaking Spanish] I will pay you your money. You have my word on that. We don't know you. And your word means nothing to us. So, until we get that gun back, we're not doing anything. Hmm? You want a gun! How's mine, huh? I never break my word as long as obligations are met. Find my father, Kraley. One in the head. Just like I did with your FBI friend... I'll find you. I'll find you. ♪ Look, they say they wanna walk ♪ ♪ But they ain't been to war With somebody like me ♪ [sighs] Five million reasons. That's why. Yeah, if they pay. He's their father. Head of the cartel. They'll pay. [door opens] Hey, what's she doing here? Steve said he's got unfinished business with her. [knock at door] - Come in. - [door opens] Thanks for coming, Tara. When I reached out to you, it was for answers. You promised me you had some. So tell me... what happened that night? [screams and whimpers] The report was true. It was Russian gangsters. They tortured us for information about a bust we made... and when they didn't like the answers, they killed Damon. But listen, we will find the guy that killed him. And we will get justice. I promise. Well, then, answer me honestly... were you helping him in the RICO case? Or were you the reason for it? Well, right now we need each other. You understand? We helped him. To help ourselves. So then, why not just tell me this over the phone. Why ask me here? What is this? We collected some money in Damon's memory. That cashier's check is what we raised. [sighs] No, this is a lot of money. Keep it. If you don't need it now, save it for your son's college fund. Damon would've wanted that. Please. [door closes] I thought I smelled something bad. That hurts. - No, it doesn't. - Oh, come on, you miss riding with me? - [Hoke] Admit it. - [Beach] Don't flatter yourself. I was glad to go back to a one-man car. Especially when I found out you were transferring to the rat squad. Yeah? Well, when you hear this, you're gonna be happy I did. A reporter called, looking for an official comment on a story they're about to drop. What kind of story? An exposé on cop gangs. - Are you shitting me? - I wish I was. But they mentioned you specifically. The police commission is freaked out. I mean, obviously it's bad for the department's image. They're gonna come in here and snatch all of your badges just to cover their asses. Who's the reporter? I-I can't tell you that. We both know what you're gonna do. All right? That's only gonna make things worse. Come on. I covered for your ass a ton of times. Give me something. Like what? Anything. - Who's the source? - I don't know. Bullshit. I don't. But for you I can find out. Goodbye! [laughs] [footsteps approaching] Oops. Oh! [laughs] Hey, princesa. Hey. Why don't you go into your room, and let your father and me talk, OK? We don't need to talk. I'm here to see my daughter. Not you. Yeah, and you will. After we talk. Go, mija, go. It's OK, princesa. I'll be right there. This is bullshit. Don't you ever talk to me like that in front of my daughter again. I talk to you the way I have to. What happened to Don Ignacio, it's all over the news. I wouldn't know anything about that. Or care. Come on, Pete, don't lie to me. Not if that little girl means as much to you as you say she does. Huh? You think we want to be in their debt? You did this to us. If I hadn't stepped in, you and the other Ravens would all be dead. You didn't save our lives, you sold them. [chuckles] We done here? By now you know what these people are capable of, right? They might hurt Veronica if they felt it necessary. - No, that will never happen. - You're wrong, Pete. As long as you remain in her life, that will always be a possibility. Veronica's happy here. But most importantly, she is safe. You took my wife... I will not allow you to take my daughter as well. ♪ Hella bands, hella bands ♪ ♪ I got hella bands, hella bands ♪ ♪ I got hella bands, hella bands ♪ ? If you don't do it somebody else can 'Cause I got hella bands ♪ You had no right giving her our money! - [Cole] We've got nothing now. - What? I gave Byrd's widow a hundred grand from the pension. - We owed it to him. - The hell we did! And that ain't the worst of it. Article's coming out about cop gangs. - Specifically mentioning the Ravens. - And specifically naming her. - Why you? - We're working on finding out. Maybe it's because she keeps pissin' everybody off. - I give it how I live it. - [Kraley] Enough. Even though he pissing away our pension, and she's dragging us into a shit-storm... - there's still a silver lining to this. - Bullshit. We're screwed. So what if we are? Who needs badges? We get that five million, we got fuck you money. What? We're not ignoring the article. Kraley, we need to make it go away. Fair enough. So we got two problems. The most profitable one being the Cartel. So let's handle that one first. You two, pay a visit to Tristan. He sold the intel about the transport to us. Find out who else knew about it. [Steve] Listen, I know Tristan pushes your buttons, but stay focused. - [Cole] I feel ya. - [door closes] How'd it go, Pete? Not good. Divorce is part of the job. I got no sympathy on that. It's not about the divorce anymore. It's about my little girl. Steve. I lose my visitation if Lourdes and her father can convince a judge I'm unfit. It'll shake out. First the FBI, now the Cartel... We gotta get out of this cycle. If we get this money, we gotta use our share to go legit. Go legit? What the fuck would you two do? The opposite of whatever you're doing. [chuckles] [Carl] Hey. I need a word. What about? My goddaughter's busting my balls. How do you feel about her? She's a bit young for me, don't ya think? Don't even go there. Honestly I don't know anything about her. Before he ate a bullet, her dad rode with you. How much more you need to know? It's not gonna happen. She's not her old man. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey! What do you guys want? - [Beach] To talk. - Talk about what? Somebody took Ignacio from us, after we took him from you. Now, how the hell do you think that happened, huh? You had him. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, man! Don't touch my leg! You do that again I'm gonna yell for staff to throw you out. He's gonna yell for staff to throw me out this hospital. Since the two of you have history, why don't you wait outside. Yeah, go outside. That way if he starts to get loud, you can just explain to the staff that we're doing physical therapy. What? [door opens] There. Thank you. [beeps] Hey. Remember me? From the barbecue? Cole, right? Yeah. Your dad ain't around here, is he? Why? You scared? Hell yeah, I'm scared of him. [Cole laughs] But I'd like to take you to dinner sometime. Why? Because I want to get to know you. I only sold that info to you guys. Then you must've been running your mouth in front of the wrong people. I didn't. All right! But I'm not the only one who knew that was going down. Who else then? [scoffs] Supervisor, all the guards on that detail. Everybody. Did they sell it to someone? No. [screams] No! My sergeant mentioned it to an old partner of his. This old partner of your sergeant, he have a name? [sighs] Eli. I'm gonna need more than that. Look, I can't, all right? I don't want to start a turf war. He's in a club? [groans] Yes, all right? He's a Horseman. Horsemen are Port police? Why are they interested in our guy? I don't know, bitch. Why don't you ask them. Why do people keep calling me that? [Tristan screams] [vehicle approaches] Don't embarrass me on this. I'm under pressure here. You get that, right? No. Of course you don't. [door opens] What's he doing here? Mind your business. [Kraley] I hear you've dealt with the Horsemen before? Tell me about it. There's not much to tell. Neckbone wanted the ports to move a little weight, Winters contracted a deal with the Horsemen, splitting the tax. Neckbone's gone, so who's dealing with the Horsemen now? I want the corners back. - Jesus. - No. We have nothing to talk about. Because whatever you got going with the Colombians is gonna pay. He asked why you wanted to talk. I didn't say anything other than that. She's telling the truth. I don't know what you got going on with them, I don't care. All I care about is telling my people we're earning again. Look, we gave you those corners because of what Winters did. That debt is now paid. It's time to give them back. OK. You got the spots back. Mexican cartel took Neckbone's place. The Horsemen shut us out of the deal as soon as they did. [door opens] We'll give Carmen the information and if they get the old man back... [door opens] ...we should get a percentage of the reward as well as the gun. They're not gonna go for that. And I don't want a percentage, I just want my five million bucks. Kraley, for once in your life think about someone other than yourself. Someone else? Last I checked our fingerprints aren't on the gun. Just yours. So the way I see it, it's you just thinking about yourself. [door opens and closes] My brother, Ricardo, was contacted by the Mexicans a few hours ago. It's about turf. They want our product out of the city. So give them what they want and get your old man back. My brother would start a war before he did anything like that. I need you and the Ravens. We're not interested in getting between you, your brother, and the Mexicans. That's a no-win situation for us. You and I have a lot in common. We're both trying to move in better directions, but at the end of the day we're just at the mercy of other people. And because of it, there's a new deal in place. What's that supposed to mean? When you called and said that we needed to meet, I was curious as to why Kraley wasn't joining us. So I called him. - Son of a bitch. - In his defense, he did make new demands. Like what? An extra million. And a sign of goodwill. [speaking Spanish] If you give me that, why should I help you? For the money, which Kraley says you need to get out of this life. ♪ Sunup to sundown My people get it ♪ ♪ Distressed jeans, Timb boots And a Yankee fitted ♪ ♪ The way the chain hang They say I overdid it ♪ [police sirens blaring] [police radio chatter] - License and registration. - What'd I do? I have the right to know. You absolutely do. And that's why I'm gonna put it in writing for you. Now give me your license and registration. This is why people hate cops. The feeling's mutual. [phone ringing] Anything? [Hoke] Yeah. You're not gonna like it. [Kraley] We all got needs. You want your daughter back, that six million would get you the best lawyer in town. - I say we chance it. - They're not hood rats we're dealing with. They're a lot more dangerous than that. Back me up on this. He's right. I'm gonna need that money, Steve. Kraley? What's up? I'm busy. Carl told me you said no. Yeah, I did. Can you just hear me out? - Look, I ain't got time for this shit. - Look, look, look, I lead in arrest stats over at the 14th. If I stayed, I would've been treated well, but I didn't. Because ever since I was a kid I looked up to my dad. I need to know that he's looking down on me and he's proud. Transferring here and becoming a Raven would've been what he wanted. Bullshit. I knew your old man. He would've wanted his kid far away from this kind of shit. It's not just about me. Now that he's gone I'm responsible for raising my little sister. You can't do that on a cop's salary. I need to earn. Your problem, not ours. - What was that all about? - [Kraley] Says she wants to earn. So, let her. Her old man was a stand-up guy. Yeah. But we don't know her like we knew him. - You don't see the similarity? - What are you talking about, man? The only reason you got ink is 'cause of your dad and your brother. You know, the polite thing would've been to call before stopping by. We know you're running protection for the Mexican Cartel. So what about it? We earn however we want. Last I checked I don't need any other club's approval on that. What, you looking for a date? How'd you hurt your arm, man? [Eli] He scratched himself on a rusty nail. - Place is full of them. - Hey, cut the bullshit, Eli. We want to end this before it gets any worse. [Steve] Listen. How much is it going to take for you to walk away from the Mexicans? We earn because once we take a job, we finish it. So there's nothing you or the Colombians can offer that will change that. We'll see about that. Cole! What do you... [grunts] I didn't go to that reporter, he came to me. [scoffs] And that makes it OK? Do you know what you've done? I answered some questions. You saw a chance to stick a knife in my ribs and you jumped at it. Has there ever been a day in your miserable life you gave a shit about me? You had three squares and a roof over your head, didn't you? You ever give a shit what I went through to put them there? - You were my mother. That was your job. - Oh, I did my job. Never a thank-you, never an ounce of appreciation from you. Appreciate what? You treated me like I was dog shit under your shoe. You wouldn't even look at me! Just like that. You hated me from the day I was born. Turn away. Just kick me down and turn away. That is your best trick. Every time I looked at you... Every time I look at you, you wanna know what I see? I see him. Your so-called father. Coming at me. Holding me down. I begged him to stop, but he just... pulled my legs apart and rammed himself inside me. He didn't give a shit. Got what he wanted. And I got you. Dispatch, it's code-four re: unit 33 Adam. She's out on a citizen flag down. You can cancel the grid search. [Dispatcher] Copy that. [phone ringing] Amber? - Hey. - Hi. Here's the thing. The worst date I ever went on was with a doctor and the second worst was a cop and the third worst was another cop and the problem was the same with all of them. They had no interest in anything but getting me into bed... and I decided I'd never go out with another doctor or cop... and that's me right now and that's who you'd be taking to dinner. I'm interested, yeah, but... I'm not that guy, all right? A connection either happens or it doesn't. I'm not gonna try to force it. I'm gonna call you back. How about we meet tonight for a drink? At the wine bar on Third. 11:00 p.m. OK? I'll be there. I'd like that. Hey. You didn't kill her, did you? [sighs] No. Kraley needs us to meet him. About what? He didn't say. [sighs] Yeah. Shit! Uh-uh, you're coming with us, asshole. Turn around, Briggs. Turn around. Let's go. Get in there. No, stop. Oh, you're gonna wanna lose that hand. He don't like to be touched. We need to talk about the Mexicans. You know, instead of sending these assholes... you could've just asked. Yeah, but see, that would've put us on equal footing. And I just don't like equality, man. Well, I hate to break it to you, I'm not scared of them. And I'm damn sure ain't scared of you. We'll see. Venga. - No, no, no. - Stay here. My brother will handle this part. He's a cop. I'm not gonna let you hurt him. Is he a cop? Or is he a gang member? - You can't be both. - Well, we fuckin' are. So listen to what the man said. [Carmen] Your call. Families are out of bounds. Not to us. Relax. Men will do almost anything to protect their family. He'll do what we want. Vamos. My father is being held in building forty at the Port. He's being watched by a group of Mexican nationals. So we don't make things any messier than they need to be, we want you to go and get him back. The Mexicans are dangerous. I'm not worried about the Mexicans. I'm worried about the Port cops. You need to keep your men off that part of the Port. We'll need his uniform shirt and his access card. OK. Bring my father back safe. Once you do, you'll be paid what you were promised. Look at this. [scoffs] This shit doesn't even fit me. Stay focused. I want us all going home in one piece. We will. So long as Eli called his guys off. You know he's gonna retaliate for this shit. Of course he's gonna. [Kraley] We'll worry about that when we have to. Focus on this. [Cole] Shit! What? I was supposed to meet someone. [Ramos] Well, don't text right now. That shit will ping off the nearest cell tower and pin us to this location. He's right. If this goes south we don't want them tracing us back to a cartel site. Port Authority left about 20 minutes ago. - Haven't seen any movement since. -[Beach] What's she doing here? Kraley's seeing if she can hang. That's not a very good idea. I don't even like her. - I can hear you. - I know. Hey, stay on the perimeter and keep an eye out. We'll take care of the inside. By the time they realize we're not Port cops, we'll have the drop on them. We're in, we're out, no one pulls the trigger unless we have to. - Let's go. - Copy. [door beeps] On me. Cover down. [door opens] - Show me your hands. - [Ramos] On the ground! [Kraley] Don't even think about it! Play it smart, dick for brains. Tell me where your friends are. [door opens] [Kraley] Goddamn it! What are you doing here? [Steve] Oh! You motherfucker! [grunting] [Ricardo] Leave him. We need to get to my father. Hammond! Go that way! [gunshots] [grunting] [Steve] He's hit! [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] - What the... - Shit! - He ain't here. - Yeah, but it looks like he was. Look, this place is gonna be crawling with uniforms pretty goddamn soon. And we ain't gonna be able to explain this shit... let alone that I'm dressed like one of them. Well, come on, let's go. Come on. [gasping] Don't touch it. [gunshot] I had it handled! Did you? Next time... it goes in you. No! I will find you. [theme music playing]
