 I know someone that witnessed the shooting. - Somebody who says it was G? - It's a child. I'm taxin' the Ravens for what we're losin' because that asshole arrested G. - Hey! - Come on! Come on! Come on! If you had a witness, I'd still be in jail. I just don't want to put this person in your sights, man. Who is it? Move. I did not rape your mother. We slept together once. Consensually.

 Wake the hell up, or get out! 'Cause I'm not the one who's lying. Dani told her friend that men with guns broke into your house a few nights ago. I'm going to ask the Department of Children's Services to do a home check. They trust you yet? They don't even trust each other. It's about time I meet these people myself. Start layin' track for an intro. This relationship you got with the cartel... It's gonna end badly. They're not gonna let us walk away. Then I need someone I can trust runnin' it.

 I don't want to go to jail again. - Can I help you? - DEA! Hands where I can see 'em! What the hell's goin' on? The DEA has their hands on the cartel's throat, and it's just a matter of time before our connection to them comes up. I'll find Price and get the answers we need. She can't come to the phone right now. But maybe I can help. Your brother's running his own program, and Price is gonna help him do it. You don't wanna hear the truth, do you? That your son is a traitor. What are you gonna do about it? I will talk to him. Face to face. That's a bad idea. What did he say? - He wants the Ravens to work for him. - And? Listen, I said what I needed to to get out of that room. That doesn't mean I'm gonna do it. So, you're gonna say no? Yes. Good. I'm glad to hear that, because there are a lot of people that are still loyal to my family that want to see my father back in power. - What the hell's goin' on? - You OK? Where's Cole? Texted him to meet us, but he never showed. Ricardo's taken over the cartel. Killed anyone loyal to Ignacio. - What about Carmen? - She's saying what she has to so that he doesn't lock her up like her father. And he tried to kill Price. But she got away. Shit. Why'd he have Hector take you to him? He wants us to organize the other cop gangs. Get them all working strictly for him. - Not happening. - But you told him no, right? Just like Carmen, I told him what he wanted to hear. But as far as we're concerned, it's a no. How do we distance ourselves from this without it going south? We back Carmen. Are you fucking kidding me? It's the lesser of two evils. This isn't about Barry or that man. This is about you. You said we should always tell the truth. I did. And I would never ask you to lie. We just want you to not talk about this. To anyone. He killed Barry. And God will judge him for that. Just promise us. Please. You know what, Barry wouldn't want you in danger. And that's what will happen if people know that you saw the shooting. You said tellin' the truth builds trust in an untruthful world. I say a lot of things. But I'm just a man, son. I'm not always right. You was about that. Dani, are you OK? Isabel Williams. I'm with the Department of Child Services. I'm taking Dani into state protection. The hell you are. Here's the court order. So you go to college? Are you kidding me? Maybe I would have if you'd been around to pay for it. Must be nice having all these young women constantly throwing themselves at you. Not really. You learn to set up some pretty firm boundaries. How do you mean? I teach in a class with more than 80% women. Many of them would be more than happy to... threaten or flirt their ways to a passing grade. Don't try and tell me you don't date. You're in your fifties, you're not dead. Yeah, I'm careful. Bad relationship could end my career. It's why I keep my office hours in a public area. Hey. Excuse me a minute. AreAre you here officially? What do you mean? With Mr. Everett. About the accusations? What accusations? Sorry to bother you. Officer Hammond. Can we speak? About what? I'm looking for Aria Price. Any idea where she's at? Ignacio Velasquez. Freed during transport by a heavily armed, well informed group. There's also security contracts that tie you to Carmen Velasquez. What does one thing have to do with the other? Everything. I'm gonna let you in on something so we can both stop wasting each other's time. Aria Price is out because I let her out, and I did so not because of information she gave me, but information that she would be gathering for me. So she was an informant? "Was"? Is she dead? If you got a case, arrest me. If not, piss off! I have everything I need to indict you and the rest of the Ravens for what you did with Ignacio. But it's the cartel I want. So what I'm doing here... is giving you a choice. What's the ask? Exactly. Price is either dead or on the run. Either way, I need a new informant. One that's already inside and trusted. Ignacio isn't running things anymore. Ricardo is. Good. He's impulsive. Makes him easy to manipulate. Are you in? Or out? This decision isn't just mine to make. I need to run it by my guys. No, this deal is for your ears only. And it's not a free ride. There are consequences to actions. Once we take the cartel down, you go to jail as well. Then why would I do it? Because for every cartel member you testify against, your sentence gets reduced. - Not interested. - You'll be the only Raven to testify and the only Raven we'll prosecute. So you'll keep all my guys out of it? As long as you do what's needed. I've been lied to before, so I want it in writing. That's not a problem. We need to get Ignacio back in custody. And you need to find out where he's at, and tell me. He's being held by Ricardo's men. I don't know where. Then find out through Carmen. And put a target on my back? She's gonna know I was the one who gave him up. You broke him out. It's only fair that you help get him back. - Where are you, Cole? - Cole's tied up right now. Where is he? The fuck's my brother? He's safe, for now. You remember what happened when Neckbone fucked with my family, right? This is happenin' because your brother crossed the line. And I ain't Neckbone. He's still alive. And he'll stay that way, as long as I get what I want, What is it you want? I'm hearing there's a witness to some work I put in. But your brother won't tell me who it is. So before I go to an ignorant place and beat it out of him, I figured I'd ask you. Take me to him. Take me to him and I'll get you the answer you need. No, you won't. You'll just try something stupid. You touch him... we're goin' to war. So think real hard about your next move? You got 24 hours. If I don't have a witness by then, then I'll do something stupid. You feel me? You already have. Clock's ticking. We're not really gonna give up a witness to that asshole, are we? No. I need you two to start sniffin' around G's territory. See if we can't get a lead on where they're keepin' him. But we better keep it low-key, 'cause G hears we're doin' it, he'll kill Cole. Steve. Cole's not the only problem. I can see it on your face. There something else going on? Yeah. We're a family. We handle this shit together. So tell me. What's up? You trust me, Karen? Of course I do. Then stay out of it. Please. - Hey, you got a sec? - Now's not a good time. DCS took Dani away from me. What? Shit! - Yeah. - I'm sorry, Chris. I don't know what to do. Listen, you're not alone, all right? There's a lot of shit goin' on right now, but we got your back. I promise, we'll get your sister back. You hear me? Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Why the sudden interest? If there was a witness to a murder, I need to know about it. Where's Cole? He's tied up on somethin'. Why? I already told him about this, and he agreed it's better the kid doesn't come forward. The kid? Don't do this. Please. I'll find another way to keep G off the streets. And tell your friends, too. No more comin' here, askin' questions. Friends? The other cops. They were here this morning. Asking about the witness, as well. They have a name? I'm pretty sure one of the name tags said Jones. You leave a message saying it's important I call, and then when I do, you ignore me. There's a lot goin' on right now. No kidding. You look like shit. So why don't you tell me what's up? I need you to shut down the security business. Leave a letter of resignation on the desk where someone can find it, and just walk away. - Is it that bad? - Yes, that bad. And you need to distance yourself, brother. Talk to me. Talk to me. C'mon. You were right. So just fuckin' do it. No. The Vipers are puttin' in work for G. And the witness he's lookin' to wet down is a kid. So giving him up is a non-starter. Yeah. We need another way to get Cole back. If the Vipers are workin' that closely with G, they gotta know where Cole is. So how do we get them to tell us? We ask an ugly way. They're still not gonna say shit. I know those guys. Then maybe we point out there's a shitload more money to be made workin' for the cartel. Hey. Got answers for me? If you want the cop gangs in your back pocket, they'll need cash up front. Money motivates. No, no. We pay for services rendered. We don't do retainers. Ricardo, the only way the other cop gangs are gonna take this arrangement seriously is if you outpay the competition. - How much are we talking about? - Two hundred thousand. And even then, there are gonna be holdouts. But a majority will agree. Comin' over to our side? Where the real men are? Where's Cole? I don't know what you're talking about. - Anybody? - Snatching a cop is crossing the line. What do you think's gonna happen if G kills him? He'll be dead. Like them. These three. They died in the line. McNabb here ate his gun after he retired and his old lady left him. This guy. You guys remember this loser? Yeah, this is a dumb ass who's stupid enough to think he could rob the Colombian cartel. That's not on us, though. Towards the end, that sellout was more Raven than Viper. I know you all feel his pain, but you need to sit down. You ain't gonna shoot a cop. You ain't a cop to me. Take a seat, assholes. Whatever G's payin' you, we'll make sure the cartel doubles it. Just tell us where he's at. We're not interested. He speak for all of you? What, money ain't important? If it involves you assholes, no amount of money brings us to the table. Stop being a dick. Where's Cole? Go fuck yourself. You two post up on Jones, we'll take G. See if that visit creates any movement. Holy shit. Never know what you're gonna need. That stuff isn't department issue. Let's go. So why we back in bed with the cartel? Thought you didn't want to hear about it. Same reason we do anything. We're on a money chase. You see that look in Karen's eyes when she came at Jones? Yeah. She don't do grief like normal people. Never understood her and Foster. I don't think she did, either. What does she do like normal people? That's what I'm telling you. You don't play by the rules. You make them play by yours. If it was me... It's not you. It's me. When it comes to my sister, I'm not takin' chances. You want her back, you do whatever it takes. Put this under the tire well of Jones's car. It's that ugly-ass Camaro over there. Hey, listen. Take your time, do it right, and don't be seen. Got it. - Yeah? - Can you talk? Yeah. About what? I want you to tell me exactly what he did to you. Why? OK, I will. And Mom... thank you. You OK? Yeah. Fuck! Help! Help! Son of a bitch hit an alarm, - we need to move him! - I'll be there in five. Let Steve know Jones is on the move. Jones is mobile. Jones. What's your 20 and direction of travel? East on 7th Street, crossing Cloverfield. Move him, let's go. Get him in the trunk. Don't even think about it! Back up. Move away, Jones. Move away. Back up! Easy, bitch. Easy. Back up. Got him, Ramos? Yeah. Yo, back it up, back up! He's in. Get G on the cell. Tell him we lost Cole. Thank you. Sit down, old man. And you too, lady. Now, you know why I'm here. Just give me a name, and... we're out of your lives. Son, I have no idea what you're talkin' about. - Aah! - Don't you touch him! We don't know what you're talking about! Yeah... you do. I'm gonna give you five chances, and then it's over. Arm, arm. Leg, leg. And head. Get off me! I need to ask the same question. He doesn't... He doesn't know! Is that right? Do you know? Same game. Different target. - Aaah! - Stop it! - Stop it! - I will. When you give me an answer! It's me! I me, I'm the witness! - He's a cop. - Come on, man, move! Man... This is only temporary. For how long? I don't know. Not forever. I'm gonna get you back. I don't wanna stay here. I wanna go with you. They won't listen to me here. I know. I'm gonna bring you back home. I promise. OK? Yeah. Just gotta try and be strong. Cole. Want me to come in? I know it's late. I'm sorry. Drink? This isn't a social call. Let's make it one. If you want to talk business, you probably should be talking to my brother. Right? If I'm doin' business with your family, I'd rather it be with you. That's not your decision to make. Do you know where Ignacio is being held? - Why? - If I can free your father... what's in it for me? Depends. What are you after? Qué? - Qué paso? - We need to talk now. OK. I'll see you here in an hour. Hey. - Thanks for meeting me. - You said it was important. Yeah. I need to ask you something. About? How long have you been teaching at the university? This one... seven years. And before that? Why? These are complaints... filed by female students and faculty members from the last three places that you've worked. They're all the same. But you kept your job because there's nothing in here that you couldn't dismiss as a misunderstanding. - Or consensual. - This is... I don't want to hear your side of the story. - I want to hear theirs. - There's nothing here... My mother told me exactly what you did to her. It's hard to believe I came from your pathetic set of balls. Now, when I let go, you'll suffer for a little bit, but the pain will fade. What you do to these women... - never leaves them. - All right! All right! Aaah! All right, what? - She might have felt that... - Don't go there. Say the word. Say "I raped her." I raped her. I raped her! From now on, you keep it in your pants. Because if you don't, I'm gonna come back here and rip that fucker off. Go! Go! Go! Habla. We have the package. Heading back to home base. So now what? We focus on Ricardo.
