 (MUSIC PLAYING) CARMEN: We want our father back, no questions asked. Until we get that gun back, we're not doing anything. By now you know what these people are capable of. You did this to us! You took my wife. I will not allow you to take my daughter as well! A reporter called looking for an official comment on an exposé on cop gangs. Who's the source? I didn't go to that reporter. He came to me.

 And that makes it OK? Anything you need, I'm down for the Ravens. We know you're running protection for the Mexican cartel. There's nothing you or the Colombians can offer that will change that. We'll do almost anything to protect our family. My father is being held at the border. Sit on the perimeter, keep an eye out. No one pulls a trigger unless we have to. - I had it handled! - Next time it goes in you. (MUSIC PLAYING) (CLATTER) - You were told to wait outside. - I heard gunshots. Did you see what happened? - Did you see what happened? - No.

 (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) Aw, shit! How? He turned his back on the wrong guy. We got no time for this! - We gotta get the hell out of here. - Yeah, we do. (BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH) KRALEY: Let's go. Come on! Move! Vamonos. KRALEY: Let's move! You wanted in? Now you are. (MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC PLAYING) - COLE: Eli must have sold us out. - RAMOS: Yeah, but we did the job, - so we're owed. - The deal was we deliver Ignacio. Until we do, we're not gettin' shit. I'm losing patience with these fuckers. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Keep an eye on him. Let me know if he starts planning anything stupid. (GRANDFATHER ASSASSIN SPEAKING SPANISH) (RICARDO SPEAKING SPANISH) Sí, señora. Ricardo... (CONTINUES IN SPANISH) No. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (CHATTER) Shit stings. BEACH: Just remember, what Ravens do is Ravens' business. No one else's. (CHATTER) Are we good? Meadow. You keep your mouth shut, we're good. I will. I will. (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE) - Cheers. - Yeah. Carl's askin' for visits. Want a burger. - Make sure he gets one. - Why me? 'Cause he knows you don't like him. To a guy like Carl, it makes it taste better. (CHUCKLES) Kraley's tellin' them the Colombians stiffed us. I was just tellin' 'em, with people not paying what's owed... it's not so easy keeping the club flush. So if these Colombians wanna screw with us, we should send 'em a message. What do you think? HAMMOND: I think we got enough problems. We don't need fresh ones. (PHONE BUZZING) You better not be calling to cancel my visit with Veronica tomorrow. LOURDES: She's sick. She has a sore throat. Then I'll see her while she's sick, then. I didn't call to only tell you that, Pete. - Then what'd you call for? - To talk. You're tearing her apart, Pete. She needs space to process things. I think it'd be better if you... Whoa. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Don't you go there. You don't get to use her as a way to punish me. You hear me? So tomorrow, Tuesday? Pete, it's really unfair, and I think... - (RUCKUS INSIDE) - Listen, I gotta go. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE) It says the police commission's moving forward with the investigation. Get with Pastor Greg, come up with another outreach event. Something wholesome. Buy us some good will we can leverage when we deny the commission's allegations. - Don't waste your fuckin' time. - Like always, you got an opinion, but no solution. Flippin' burgers and handing out flyers is not a fuckin' solution. They didn't mention you? Mother must have had had a change of heart. - COLE: Or a fist to the face. - BEACH: Same thing. We gotta get ahead of this. You two go dig up some dirt on this piece-of-shit reporter. It's a little too late to try to discredit him, Kraley. Discrediting him is not what we're after. We need his new source. Where ya goin'? Cartel owes us a payday. If we have to ride out an investigation, we're gonna need one. We've already been over this. Ricardo ain't gonna pay till we hand over his father. We'll see about that. (DOOR CLOSES) (MONITOR BEEPING) (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) - (DROPS BAG) - Wake up, man. (SIGHS) I oughta take this pillow and just right on the... Try it and I'll get out of this bed and whoop your ass. (LAUGHS) Here, man, eat up. Mm. (CHATTER) Does your friend need something? Yeah. His catheter slipped out. No matter how much I try, I just can't get it back in. He doesn't have a catheter. I guess that would be the reason why he keeps fighting me so much. Listen, I tried calling you. Yeah, well, I've been busy. No, you haven't. You could have at least sent me a text. I looked like a fool sitting there waiting for you. It was work. Look, I'm sorry, Amber. I really am. Can I make it up to you? Hmm? I don't give second chances. But for you, I'll make an exception. Good. I could use an extra hand. The library closes in a couple hours. It's gettin' late. I'll be fine. How about if I walk with you? I could use the exercise. Be back by dinner. Here we go. Male, 37, award-winning investigative reporter. In the middle of a divorce. Lives by himself. The two of you have so much in common. Burner phone. Send him an anonymous text from someone who has information about the Berserkers, who wants to talk to him but he's scared. And if he hits you back, don't reply. Just ghost his ass. And what if he doesn't buy it? Hmm. Burn his house down with him in it. I think there's a few more steps we could take before that. If you say so. (RAP MUSIC PLAYING, LYRICS INDISTINCT) (GROANING) RICARDO: Until my father is delivered to us safely, you get nothin'. I wonder how your father deals with men who break agreements. You can ask him when you find him. We put our asses at risk twice trying to save your father. That deserves something, Ricardo. I pay for results. Not attempts. You don't pay for shit. That's the problem, ain't it? You need money? I'll pay you to escort a car from point A to point B. Another job. - How much? - Fifty thousand. And I'll pay you in advance. Now you're talkin' my language. This guy ain't gonna take the bait. You'd make a shit fisherman, you know that? These kinds of things take time. But if he doesn't leave his house in the next couple hours, like I said, I got gasoline in the trunk. Of course you do. RAMOS: There we go. Come on. BEACH: Everything's scattered. How's he keep track of any of this shit? He probably has a system. Put everything back where you found it. Could be on one of these. Or all of 'em. Unh-unh. Bad idea. He'll know. If he's got any common sense, it'll scare the shit out of him. Receipts... Divorce shit... This guy's a hoarder. Rejection letters for his never-to-be-published novel. Loser. I've got something. Shit. That fucking bitch. She's their second informant. Bitch is sitting in federal lockup blaming us for ruining her life. Yeah. And we can't get to her. If Price talks to the police commission, we're all screwed. Kraley's gonna wanna know about this. (DOOR CLOSES) (SIREN CHIRPS) (CAR ALARM CHIRPS) What do you want, Eli? Revenge. But I'll settle for restitution. Listen, what we did saved your men's lives. You let them use my family as leverage. That's out of bounds. Her choice, not mine. But let's face it. Bad shit happens when you kidnap the godfather of a drug cartel. - (BLOW LANDS) - Uhhh! - (COUGHING) - The Mexicans are asking for answers. They want to negotiate new terms for handing over Ignacio. You got 24 hours to make this shit right, Hammond. - Or what? - Or I'm giving 'em the Ravens. HAMMOND: Ahh! (MUTTERS) ELI: Am I understood? That's Kraley's problem... I said... am I understood? Yeah. Fuck you! ELI: Let's go. The Mexicans want to renegotiate terms. How do you expect peace to be mediated? With a lot of money. You want your father back, don't you? Of course I do. But my brother still wants the ports. He won't get the ports. Not without starting a war. Besides, that's the Horseman's territory, and they don't like you. You're scared of them. Carmen, I got enough enemies. I don't need any more. Well, we'll reach out and talk terms with the Mexicans. - Do that. - Think about this: your enemies don't cease to exist because you give them what they want. (CELL PHONE RINGING) - RAMOS: Yeah? - HAMMOND: I'm calling a summit. Text everyone and tell them to be there tonight. Why, is there something I should know about? We can't weather the heat from the commission and the press unless we're all on the same page. If the clubs stay divided, they'll just pick us off one by one. You run this by Kraley? Just do what I ask. Look, I'll make the calls. I just don't think there's a chance in hell that the clubs are gonna listen to reason. - At least not from us. - (DISCONNECTS) Get in. It's about Veronica. RAMOS: Shit. - (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE) - (DOOR BUZZES OPEN) Yeah. Thanks for letting me see him. If it's important to you, it's important to us. That's what makes social outreach work. - Is this really about outreach? - This isn't about Amber. Then why are you doing it? Because we care about people like you. And that kid in there. That's why. "That kid"? You don't even know his name. Game recognizes game, son, and I'm not interesting in playing yours. Hey, wait a second. Look, what do I have to do to prove to you that we're serious about working with the community? Let's take a ride. (DOOR BUZZES OPEN) (RAP MUSIC PLAYING, LYRICS INDISTINCT) (CHATTER) PASTOR GREG: You're too young to know this, but there was a time you couldn't even walk down this street. - 'Sup, Rev? - What's up? - You good? You all right? - Yeah, man. Got no complaints, man. I'm good. Yes, indeed... You two know each other. Yeah, he runs half the corners in our area. Clinton. Cole, man. A'ight, Rev. You know what we called this street when I was a kid? The Crypt. Blood's been spilled on it for the past 30 years. I lost my brother out here. I'm sorry to hear that. (EXHALES) Look, that kid that I visited today. He got chased and dragged down by two of yours yesterday. They damn near broke his arms. His name is Barry. - Barry had a gun in his backpack. - For a reason, Cole. He's got a full-ride scholarship to State. He just wants to live long enough to use it. - You just can't carry no gun. - Why not? You do. - Because I'm out here protecting... - I got it. I know he made a bad decision, man. But if he gets a record, he's gonna lose that scholarship. All right, I'm gonna look into it. I'm gonna do that. But I'm gonna expect something for it. Of course you would. You get him out and I'll see that people start to look at your friends in a more... Christian way. VICTOR: (SIGHS) So you're good with it. - Yeah. - Yeah? Are you OK? - Honey, everything's gonna be fine. - Thanks, Dad. You didn't have to send this pendejo after me. You coulda just called. Saves time. - Where's my daughter? - VICTOR: She's fine. I wasn't asking you. Where's my daughter? What's this? We're petitioning sole custody of Veronica. With no visitation rights. And... we'll win. We'll counter. Oh, Pete. (SIGHS) Just sign it. If you do, you can continue to have supervised visits. If you don't... we'll destroy you. - LOURDES: Pete! - (ALL YELLING) - PETE: Get off me! - You OK? That's all right. I'm fine. LOURDES: Stop! Daddy! - Dad! - Stop! LOURDES: It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. I'm so sorry you had to see that. Dad... TITO: Just go. Don't make this worse for yourself. Or her. Dad! (SNIFFLING) - LOURDES: Veronica... - No! - Dad! Dad! - It's OK. It's OK. - (VERONICA CRYING) - No matter what, I'm your father. OK? I'm your father... (KISSES) Princesa. - All right? - (VERONICA WHIMPERING) LOURDES: It's OK. It's OK. It's fine... KRALEY: What do you think's inside those boxes? COLE: Dope. No. This was from Carmen's side of the business. Do you think it's money? None of our business either way, right? (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Whatever happens here today, me and you, we still got unfinished business. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (RICARDO SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKS SPANISH) (LAUGHS) Get the hell out! Por favor. (DOOR OPENS) So is the problem resolved? (GRUNTS) In theory. You're not confident? Not as much as I'd like to be. The second they hand your father back, we're expecting payment. I'm paying a ransom. So you, and the Ravens, have nothing to do with that. He was in jail. We broke him out... - Kraley. - Not you. HAMMOND: Kraley! So there are two issues. The first being, you sent Lourdes and Veronica away. Yeah. I was workin' a case. It was for their own safety. That's not the picture your wife painted in her statement. Listen, I'm a good father, all right? I help my daughter with her homework, we play chess together... I read to her before she goes to bed. None of that changes the allegations your wife is making. I thought you were supposed to be on my side. I'm trying to prepare you for the type of treatment you should expect at the hearing. RAMOS: OK. What's the second issue? Cop gangs. Your wife says you're a member. And based on the article I read, that could be a problem in the eyes of the court. It's not a gang. We're a social club. You know cops hang out with other cops, right? You know, swap war stories. Unwind. It was a pretty damning article. And I hear there's more to come. I'll explain when I'm in front of the judge. Mr. Ramos, you'll be lucky if you don't end up in prison. I'll need at least 30,000 as a retainer if you want to make this a fair fight. I don't have that kind of money right now! Then I'm not interesting in the case. Without money to bring on other resources, I can't win. (TABLET BEEPING) (GRUNTING, PANTING) (GRUNTING, PANTING CONTINUE) DANI: Who are you? Who killed my grandson? Reach for the gun and your little sister is dead. Please don't. GRANDFATHER ASSASSIN: Answer my question. I don't know what you're talking about. Who? (COCKS PISTOL) CHRISTINE: Hammond. It was Steve Hammond. (TIRES SQUEAL) - (CHATTER) - ELI: Shit. About damn time. KELLER: Where's Kraley? Isn't he in charge now? HAMMOND: He's got me running point on this. Can we just get this over with? The article. It's just the beginning. We all know this is gonna end badly if we don't do something. This ain't the first time we've had heat. The Department will do some damage control, and within a week, back to business. (SLAPS OBJECT ON TABLE) HAMMOND: That's their snitch. We all know the bitch has dirt on all of us. Those are just a few of the surveillance photos this reporter had in his possession. - TYSON: Shit! - FOSTER: You got our attention. - What's the pitch? - Two things. We all got people in our clubs who've been moved to other assignments... some of them valuable. Reach out to 'em. Get their help in quashing this thing. Why don't we just take out the reporter? Yeah, that's a brilliant move. Foster, teach your bitch to think without moving his lips. All right, come on. - What else? - We lay low. We stop earnin' and we start some community outreach. - Vipers ain't goin' for that. - You talkin' for your club now? No. He is not. But if we aren't earning, what is the goddamn point? Yeah, Hammond. We got needs. I'm not in these photos, so this isn't my club's problem. Do you think this ends with the Ravens? Every single one of you idiots are in this as deep as we are! You do what you want with your own little social club, Hammond. I got a business to run. - JONES: You comin'? - In a sec. FOSTER: I got a bone I can throw you. What? - A face-to-face with Price. - BEACH: How? She's in federal lockup. I already tried. Not anymore she's not. She's been subpoenaed by a defense lawyer to testify on a WMD case. - (PHONE BUZZES) - Yeah? KRALEY: You alone? Yeah. What the hell you want, Kraley? To meet and talk. - About what? - A payday. I know how you do business, and I'm not interested. Then you're an idiot. And I'll find someone who is. Why can't the Ravens handle it? (CAR APPROACHES, STOPS) (CAR DOOR OPENS) What's up? I got calls stackin' up. Let me run a scenario by you. What if you and I got out of Dodge... indefinitely? Out of this shit city, somewhere in the country. I hate the country. The tropics. Caribbean. Whatever. Doesn't matter. If I had a way to make that happen, would you come with me? I gotta handle these calls. You didn't say no. (CHUCKLES) (STARTS CAR) ( MUSIC PLAYING) (RAP SONG PLAYING, LYRICS INDISTINCT) (ALL CHEERING) - Stay out of trouble now. - Will do. See your granddad. Cole, thank you. Pastor Greg. We appreciate it. Why don't you stay for a bit? - (CHATTER) - MAN: Let's do it. I should go. Oh, no, you don't. You want to make a difference, it starts with relationships. Come on. Come on, man. (RAP SONG CONTINUES) MAN: Hustle, hustle, hustle! (CHATTER CONTINUES) (CELL PHONE RINGING OUT) (BEEP) (PHONE RINGING) Ramos. It's Carmen. I need your help. We're finished workin' for you. Your brother saw to that. The Mexicans never showed up at the exchange. My father's still gone. Please. (BEEP) (RICARDO SPEAKING SPANISH) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Hey! Look who's back. This doesn't mean we lose Meadow, right? She was always temporary, dickhead. We'll see about that. Maybe we'll put it to the vote. It's good to see you back on your feet. Seriously. Thanks, man. Anybody need a round? No wait on this side. How ya feelin'? Like I got a booty call from life and it wants to keep screwin' me. What's up with you? You ever think about just leaving this life? I took three Vicodin on an empty stomach just to get back to it. So the answer's no. Things are never as bad, or good, as we think they are. Yeah. I'm not used to this. What? I've just never seen you unsure about anything. Just give me a beer. That I'm used to. Where's everyone else? Uh, Steve and Cole are in the back, Ramon split earlier, saying he had to do something for his daughter. (ZIPS SUITCASE) (MAN ROARS) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Another? Hey. Can I ask you something? Say you had a date with a guy and he didn't show. He couldn't help it, and you find that out later. Would you still be mad? Or mad enough to get even? How late is she? She was supposed to call an hour ago to pick the dinner spot. Traffic. Or hit by a bus. Car won't start. Or she's getting you back. (PHONE BEEPS) How's the patient? On the mend. (CHUCKLES) Well, thanks for letting me know that you had an emergency. Could we? Hmm? - Come on. - OK. This is very cute. GRANDFATHER ASSASSIN: You pulled the trigger... didn't you? You killed him. Say it! Why? I'm dead either way, right? (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) (SIREN APPROACHING) (PHONE RINGING) Your men just tried to kill me. RICARDO: I don't know anything about this. I give you my word. They wouldn't try this shit without approval. They acted on their own accord. I'll fix it. But first... we're gonna need to talk about other things. (RECORDED CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) (RADIO CHATTER CONTINUES) (CLASSICAL MUSIC CONTINUES) (MUSIC ENDS, AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) Whatever this is, it's between us. Why involve them? RICARDO: You see... she says that you're the one that pulled the trigger. Not the Mexican. Did you have a gun against her head when you asked? People do what you want if you scare 'em enough. - Hey! - (CHRISTINE WHIMPERS) No more games! No more lies. He killed my friend. A federale. A Raven. So we're even. Blood for blood. That's your code, right? Right? Yes. - No, please. - No! (BOTH SOBBING, WAILING) Lucky, huh? Calm down. RICARDO: Lucky for you, you're more valuable to me than they are. - (BOTH WHIMPERING) - No, no! What are you doing? Don't let him do it. I need you. I don't need them. Easy. Easy now. Please don't. Please don't... (SOBBING) (COCKS PISTOL) ( MUSIC PLAYING)
