 {\an8}Thank you, Your Excellency. And congratulations, again. {\an8}[chuckles] Please, don't stand on ceremony. {\an8}-Farouk. Good to see you. -How are you doing, Henry? {\an8}I'm sorry, but I've got to run. {\an8}I'm due at Magdalen's this morning, and I'm already late. {\an8}Apologies in advance to your family, Your Excellency. {\an8}Increased security is going to be a bit of an inconvenience. {\an8}Oh, I'm sure they'll understand. Thanks again, Farouk. {\an8}-I'll see you later, Henry. -Yes, ma'am. {\an8}You, my friend, are lucky to be alive. {\an8}-So you keep telling me. Let's go. -[chuckling]

 {\an8}Yeah, I know. {\an8}They're a ruthless gang who use violence to intimidate their captives. {\an8}Yeah, yeah. {\an8}But I survived, thank goodness. {\an8}Yeah, you did. But their last three captives were not so lucky. {\an8}-[groans] -The good thing is that {\an8}they're mostly in custody, but their ringleader is still at large. {\an8}You know kidnapping is good business these days. {\an8}Your Excellency. {\an8}-Angela. -Magdalen. My deepest sympathies, Magdalen. I am so, so sorry. I still can't believe it. Mm, it's like a terrible dream,

 one I pray to wake up from. -Oh, please, sit. -Thank you. What I want to know is, was their motive for my kidnapping motivated by anything other than financial gain. What can I say, Henry? Look, these guys are in it for the money. You know? But they did say it was a case of mistaken identity. -But why did you ask? -I just wanted to make sure that they had nothing to do with Oga's death. Which oga? Look, I'm confused here, Henry. What are you talking about? Okay, you secret service types never change. You do realize that, being the chief of staff, I am privy to high-level, certified information? That goes without saying, Henry. -But I'm really confused here. -Seriously? I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. There was certified security information about powerfully placed individuals who were planning to harm the governor while he was in the hospital. What? I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't part of an elaborate plan. You seem to know more than I, and I should know more. But there was no elaborate plan or anything like that. And no credible intel on any threats to the governor. Are you sure? Someone has been yanking your chain, my friend. Musa had specific information about this threat. Musa jokes around a lot, you know. How are you sure he was not just being stupid? No, no, no. He was deadly serious. He had an official report. It didn't come from my people or me. No. He was a great man, Magdalen. -A man of vision. -Hmm. But a man nonetheless, Angela. Thank you for your kind words. How are the children? [sobs] I don't know. And you, how are you coping? Very kind of you to ask. Um... so far so good. -Yeah? -Yes, but it's early days. Um... the hard work starts tomorrow. He was fond of you, you know? He had lots of respect for you. But he felt you needed his protection and guidance from the shark-infested waters of state politics. Yeah. He was certainly right about that. Perhaps I shouldn't be saying this... but his cabinet was filled with ambitious people. You and Henry were the only people Peter trusted in there. You because he said you had a good heart. And Henry? He was fiercely loyal. Oh, that's... [theme music playing] [Sheri] Your Excellency. -Hello, Sheri. -[both chuckle] I just want you to know how pleased we are that you're taking over. Thank you. Who is "we"? All the female commissioners, special assistants, advisers, and members of the House. An association? Yes-- No! Not really an association. A group of women who meet from time to time to strengthen and encourage each other. Being a woman in our society is... challenging. How come I'm just hearing about this? We sent you a couple of invitations when you first arrived. But we stopped when you didn't RSVP. -I'm sorry about that. -It's okay. We want you to know that we're there for you, anytime you need us. We may not be many, but we're formidable. -Thank you, Sheri. -Thank you. David, what's going on? -They're only doing their job. -Then let them do it out there, not in here. You are the husband of the governor of this state. Do you know how important you are? Listen, I understand that. I know we live in a fishbowl now, but I want this place to be my refuge, my place. Fine. But don't take it out on the poor security guys. When did you become a political diva? Or is it an academic diva, or God forbid, both? -You're an idiot, you know that? -[both chuckle] Lesser minds have made the allegation. -Idiot. -Listen... This is a life-changing event, once in a lifetime. Ride with the wave. Don't fight the current. -Who died and made you a philosopher? -Common sense. Listen, you owe your security detail an apology. Or else they won't take the bullet for you. You're still an idiot. [both laugh] [laughter] This one was similar. I don't know what it was about you and putting it on guests. -Hey. -Oh, hello, my dear. -Hi, Auntie. Good afternoon. -How are you? -Fine, thank you. -How's your mom? She's fine. She's... My best to them, darling. Okay, you know what? Let me leave you guys, okay? Take care. You be good. And you. -I will. [laughs] -All right, darling. -Hey. -Hey, boo. [giggles] So... here's your IV. For what? Well, Mom's hosting this small dinner party to celebrate her appointment. And well, it's kind of Grandpa's idea. Mom's not too keen on it. But, Carl, you have to come. Ah, yeah, sure. But my dad has been a little unpredictable lately. Carl, please. Please, you have to come. Okay, yeah. Okay. -[laughs] -Thank you. Let me get you something to drink. You hungry? Starving. I had to leave uni early to pick up the invitations. Mom gave me a lift, but I haven't had breakfast. Oh, so, uh, Mom... uh, did she happen to mention why she changed her mind about resigning? You are not going to believe me when I tell you. -What? -It was my speech! I-- I'm confused. Okay, well, I made the video because my mom encouraged and inspired me. And then she was so inspired, she changed her mind. Isn't that amazing? [laughs] Yeah! -Uh, let me get you that food. -[chuckles] Hurry up. [Bankole and Gbenga laughing] Any rumbles? Certain parties are bent on pushing the Chinese deal through at all costs. The Shining Light group are very quiet for now. Don't let those snakes fool you. They're watching and waiting. When did Gbenga say he would get back to you? He didn't say. So where does that leave us? -Jalo! -No, no. Do I need to remind you how much I personally invested in the Chinese deal? I'm not prepared to cut my losses, run off to my village and lick my wounds. With all due respect, do you think you're the only one here who stands to lose, or who in fact has lost something? Gentlemen, in politics, we play a long game. Okay, this is a setback. But there are so many other factors in play. We need to proceed with care. I heard words floating around that Friday Bello could be pushed forward as the deputy governor. -Where did you hear that? -Around. You know how those things work. And our people want to know whether this is your initiative or a play by the Shining Light group. Well, that's the price for peace, I hear. I thought as much. Well, we already told Gbenga what we want for peace to reign, abi? -Yeah. -[Briggs] Mm-hmm. I propose we exert some more pressure. Force the issue! I agree with Dr. Jalo. I think we should harass them before they become too comfortable. It's better to watch and wait. Acting before thinking things out properly isn't prudent. I need more action. Gbenga should confirm Friday's appointment as the deputy governor. Gentlemen, please! We can't afford to be quarreling among ourselves. Angela will never agree to that. She's my daughter, Banky. I can't expose her to these dangerous thugs. You haven't told her yet? No, they're still expecting my reply. If you're willing to stand your ground, Gbenga, I can assure you that you will not lack support. -[chuckling] -Thank you, Banky! -Thank you. -You're welcome. [chuckles] The doctor is right. We should strike before she grasps the scope and potency of her power. True. But timing is crucial. A premature attack will be obvious, and it is highly anticipated. It will entail potentially damaging repercussions. So, what do you propose? Or do we just wait until she becomes too powerful to uproot? No, Friday. We need to lull our enemies into this false sense of security. And fast, Dr. Jalo. Maybe you and the honorable senator here would not be shy about airing your differences publicly. What? -It's for the benefit of the onlookers. -Why? So that we can present ourselves not unified enough to present a threat. -Of what benefit is that to us exactly? -Uh-huh? She's young, and stubborn, like her father. And naive. And we have a special operative working for us in the heart of her administration. -[man] The man has been dead. -[woman] How do you know? Don't think that the press just decided to tell us now. The man has been dead. Stop saying what you don't know. Whether in the state house -or in the hospital where he was found-- -[man] Can you imagine? Please! [man] For the past three days, he has been dead. [woman] See, I don't know what you guys-- The press goes to announce it now that he's dead. [clamoring fades out] [Dr. Jalo] I hate funerals. Why? Are you scared of dying? -Who isn't? -I'm not. I lived a good life. I don't have anything on my conscience. [chuckling] I don't know about you. Well, I'm not in any haste to go just yet. I wish Peter hadn't died. Have you considered the possibility that we might be responsible for his death? Jalo! Huh? What nonsense talk is that? Are we the one that drove the truck into his convoy? No, but we stopped him from flying when his wife wanted him to leave. So, we are now murderers? Look, Jalo, you are really beginning to annoy me. Stop it! I'm just saying, that's all. If Magdalen flew him out that day, Peter might still be alive. Jalo, if God wanted Akale to survive, he would have found him a way out of this country. Really? After we bribed everyone bribable, including the guys at the meteorological agency? Jalo, why are you pretending as if you're not part of this from the beginning? Stop it! What is wrong with you, man? Gentlemen, I'm happy you're implementing our strategy convincingly. Let her think she's breaking our ranks. Gentlemen, please! As they lowered his body into the ground, I... glanced up at her, and all I could see was the pain in her eyes. Death is the great leveler. Funerals remind us that we won't live forever. Yeah. We should enjoy life more. Do things more together, you know? Appreciate the time we have together more. Can I hold you to that? I'm not saying it's going to be easy. -I'm just saying, that's all. -I know. -Oga, you're turn. -Oh. Any particular style, sir? -Just make me look good. -Okay. Good and sexy. [chuckles] I have a meeting with Henry, and I have a cabinet meeting later. -Are you thinking of a reshuffle? -Hmm, I'm not sure. -I've been advised not to rock the boat. -Hmm. Watch your back, honey. Watch your back. I've got you for that. -Thanks. -What for? Your support. Only a real man would do what you've been doing for me. Now that feels like a bribe. [both chuckle] More like a promise of things to come. [both laugh] [speaking Pidgin] I hope so. Because I have a date with a very special lady. [indistinct TV chatter] Do you know any good hotels around here? Yes. Aina Street. Second street on your left, number 13. [barber speaking Pidgin] -Are you still going to the office? -No. It's Students' Union Week on campus. I'll just stay here and maybe do some reading. Okay, honey. Oh, and don't worry about your books and papers. I've told the movers to be careful. Movers? Don't tell me you forgot we're moving today. What? Today? I'm not even ready! We've been talking about it for days. All the children's stuff is packed. Yes, but... See, I just thought ignoring it would make it go away and we wouldn't have to move. Well, nothing's going to change, David. -It will just be like we're living here. -No, it won't. It won't, Angela. This is our home. We'd be moving into a glorified hotel. David, it goes with the job. All it takes to make a home is you and me, honey. [scoffs] I think I'll just go to the campus after all. It doesn't matter where we live. You'll always be the governor. You think that is what this is about? I'm so insecure I'd rather be governor? No, hon, what I meant was... You wanted to see me, sir? So... how's our new oga? You mean, our new boss? What can I do for you, Henry? I wanted to talk to you about the security arrangements for the governor. Oh, that's already been taken care of. And I'd like a detailed report of the people implicated in the plot to hurt Oga in the hospital. No problem. The initial investigation stalled due to lack of evidence. Do we have any further intel of their involvement in the assassination plot? Unfortunately, no, not at the moment. But we do have some persons of interest, and we'll be watching them closely. And the comprehensive list of all the suspects is included in the report? Of course. Why? I don't know. I'm thinking of ordering an autopsy. I want to be completely sure that Oga's death was not as a result of foul play. But if it is, I want all the suspects rounded up. Okay, no problem. I'll give you the list if the autopsy reveals that there's been some foul play. Good. Thank you, Musa. That's all. -[Osita] You have to tell her. -And tell her what, Osita? It's not as if I have any valid reason for not wanting to move into the governor's house. I mean, it's like the president refusing to move into the presidential villa. I know. It makes no sense, but... I just resent the hell out of it. You know, if I didn't know you better, I'd say you were being a male chauvinist. The cabinet meeting has been confirmed for later this afternoon, Your Excellency. Thank you. I'm glad you're okay. Thank you, ma'am. -So, you wanted to see me? -Yes, ma'am. I wanted to establish a timeline for my transition out of my current role, ma'am. Why? I assumed you'd be reshuffling the cabinet and appointing someone to replace me. [chuckles] Henry, do you know anyone Peter would have wanted to do your job? Ah... No, I don't, ma'am. Hmm. Look, Henry, Peter trusted you. You're a man who speaks his mind, and you're not afraid to challenge the status quo. Thank you, ma'am. I think the real question here is whether you're willing to overcome the inconvenient fact that I'm a woman. Well, Oga had a great deal of respect for you, ma'am. And I will endeavor to do the same. Thank you. I'm not asking for any favors, Henry. -Okay, thank you, Your Excellency. -You're welcome. Also, it might be a good idea if you found a new chief security officer as soon as possible. Why? Because you won't find much loyalty in the current one. Will I be getting much loyalty from you, Henry? That depends, Your Excellency. Loyalty, like respect, is earned. -Henry. -Yes, ma'am? Find me a new CSO. Yes, ma'am. -Thank you. -You're welcome. First Savannah female governor. Very fine. You need them for your house and for your office. See this one. Good for your office, good for your house. Perfect for you. Fine man, fine picture. Do you want this one? That one's 3.2. Why? And that one... Come on, it's a good buy. Oh. Hi, Dupe. -Um, you look great. -Thanks. Ah! God has answered my prayers. Dude, leave my sandwich. Go and ask Mr. Patrick to make one for you. But I'm you're guest. You're not a visitor in this house. Go on, ask Mr. Patrick to make you one. -Want one too, Dupe? -No. No thanks. [Kunle exclaims] Um... So, how have you been? Fine. Ah... uh, yeah, so thanks for-- You thanked me already. Several times. You didn't call me. Oh, ah... I don't have your number, so... -Yeah. -So, aren't you going to ask me to sit? Um, yeah, yeah. Uh, sit. Yeah, sure. Oh, and by the way, I texted it to you. Oh! Oh... Ah, well, I didn't know it was you. And besides, your boyfriend... -My boyfriend? -Kunle. [laughs] Kunle is not my boyfriend. He's just a friend. Does Kunle know that? [Kunle] Mm! This sandwich is extra special, Toju. Dude, it's a sandwich. Just a sandwich. You see, Mr. Patrick made this with love and affection. Babe, do you want a bite? Don't call me "babe." Can I use your bathroom, please? Um, yeah, yeah. Sure. This girl should be shot. -Why? -Because she's heartless. How can she post such a picture on Instagram? How does she expect Femi to feel? Well, Femi's not her guy. He likes her, but he hasn't asked her out or anything. Eh? He doesn't have to. She's supposed to know by now. [scoffs] You guys are something else. So a girl is supposed to be both pretty and psychic at the same time? Maybe. Oh, it's almost 2:00. I have to go pick up something for my mom. Oh, okay. Take care, Dupe. Is it serious? It could be problematic. What is it? You need to announce a deputy soon. Oh, I thought that could wait until later. Or you could do it now and avoid an unnecessary vacuum. Okay, well, who do you suggest? Friday Bello. Is that a joke? It's not funny, Dad. Sometimes in politics, Angela, you have to make unpalatable compromises. Why would I want Friday Bello as my deputy? He has no respect for me. He plans to sell off the state to the Chinese. And to top it all off, he wants to unseat me as governor. He may be the only chance for peace, Angela. Oh, okay. I should have known. Dad, you raised me to stand by my convictions. If Friday Bello gets his way, then everything we have fought for has been for nothing. I might as well just pack up and leave. These guys will come at us with everything they've got. When was the last time you backed out of a fight? -Fine. We've declared a war. -Yeah. Let's be sure it's one we're prepared for. [both laugh] -Hi. -Oh, hi again. I forgot my phone. Ah... My second phone. It should be where I was sitting. Okay, let me just check. Ah... Okay, oh! I found it. All right... Thanks. I guess you're better with phones than with girls. What? What do you mean? I'm a player, girl. Yeah, right. You're such a player, you can't see when a girl likes you. See you around, Toju. Uh, wait! Good afternoon, sir. We have a very good quality here. Clothing lines... You'll love it. It is a very good quality, original. And we also have a wonderful cup. We have a jug. [chuckles] You can pick your choice. Yes. Yes. See, if you don't like that, we also have this. It seems you love that one. It's very, very good material. And yes. How-- Are you not taking this? [Isong and Patrick shouting] -[Isong] Nonsense. -No. No, no, no. Madam, I cannot work with that man. Your Excellency, it is totally impossible for me to work with this man. Uh-uh! Patrick, what is the problem? Madam, I told him that I have been the Ochellos' cook for four years. -Four good years. -And so what? I know exactly what you all like. Okay, fair enough. Chef Isong? Your Excellency, as the chief cook in the governor's house, it has always been my responsibility to see to the culinary and dietary requirements of the first family. Okay, okay. Let's make this simple. -Patrick. -Madam? -Take care of the breakfast and lunch. -Mm-hmm. And dinners will be handled by Chef Isong. -Including state dinners, ma? -Yes. Thank you, ma. -Thank you, ma. -Are we all happy? -Yes, ma. -Very much, ma. You're welcome. Isn't it getting close to your bedtime? Mm-hmm. I think you've had enough to drink, man. [grunts] I've had just enough to drink. -Not a drop more, not one drop less. -[phone ringing] You should return Angela's calls. Why? She doesn't need me. She's the governor. Yes, can I help you? I want to see my son and his wife. Could I get their names, please? I want to see my son and his wife, the governor. Oh, you want to see the governor and the first gentleman? Which one is the first gentleman? Uh, madam, could you please confirm that you are here to see the Ochellos then? Yes, David is my son! Oh, okay. Thank you. Uh, sir. Do you have an appointment? Appointment? When do I need an appointment to see my children? -[Mami laughs] -I'm sorry, sir, but we are just following protocol. Protocol, my foot! I carried him for nine months. Ten. Ten months, my dear. And nobody will tell me that I need a visa to see my son. Um, Mr. Ochello is not on the premises right now. -Maybe you can call him. -What about Angela? Her Excellency is in residence. But I will need security clearance for you first. Ugh, this is degrading. This is the last time I'll come to this place. Papa, they're just doing their job. Don't forget, Angela is now the most powerful person in the state. But she's still the wife of my son. And I will not tolerate anybody keeping me waiting just to see her. It's all been sorted. Open up the gate for them. You've not heard the last of this. For such a brilliant man, you can be such a bloody fool. [chuckles] [Mami] I only came here because of my son. My son is here. That's why I'm here. -Hello, Patrick. -Sir. How are you? -Patrick. -Ma? In fact, I can't understand. How are you coping in this prison? [Papa David] Good evening, Madam Governor. Well done, Your Excellency. -Angela! -Oh, Vera! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm supposed to call you "Your Excellency," right? Only when there are others around. [both muttering] [Angela] Why are they being so cool to me? We were delayed at the gate by security. Oh! What do I do now? [Vera] You're the governor. You'll find a way. Okay. Mami, Papi, I hope it wasn't difficult getting in. Just call David for us. Why don't you ask the people you kept out there to keep us waiting for hours? Mami, I don't understand. Just call David for us, because once we get out of this place, we are not coming back. We are not coming. Vera, please, remind me to take some sand from this compound before we leave. Mami, what happened now? -Huh? -[Vera] Security delayed us. -Apparently, we don't have an appointment. -What? My security kept you waiting like common visitors? They did. Yes, they did. How dare they, huh? Vera, were you not there? Did they not know who you are? You are members of my family. We tried to tell them that, but would they listen? That is foolishness and insubordination. Without our parents, where would we be? God bless you, my daughter. God bless you. Children of nowadays don't think that way. -Hmm. -They don't. Mami, after severe discipline, I will personally introduce you to them as the first mother of this state. -[exclaims] -[Angela] With unlimited access -to the government house, yes. -Thank you, my daughter. Please, this way to the living room. Please, Mom, sir, don't worry, I will get you what-- What do you want? It's late. Let's go home. I'm going to stay. Go home, David. Angela will be worried. No, uh... I'm okay. If you don't stop this, you're definitely going to cause yourself serious problems. And since when have you, Professor Osita, become an expert on marriage? Huh? Because I've been married twice. Ah! See? Experience counts for something, you know. If I had a wife like Angela, I'd still be married. Pull yourself together, man. And stop being sorry for yourself. [phone ringing] [Angela] He's not taking his calls. Maybe he's in a meeting. -[Angela] At this time? -Where is your husband? I'm sure he'll be here any minute. [scoffs] That's what you said 30 minutes ago. [Mami chuckles] You can always tell when a wife does not know when the husband is coming home. [clears throat] It is a loss, anyway, because this food is lovely. I commend Patrick for it. Actually, it's our resident chef who you should commend for this food. -Patrick is no longer cooking for you? -No, he is. But Chef Isong comes with the house, and he's the one who prepares the dinner. I hope David won't get fat now that you have two cooks. -[chuckles] -No, I'm sure he won't. And I hope you still have time for him, now that you are a governor. Of course I will, hmm? He's my husband. Toju, have you been able to get through to your father? He's not picking up. Maybe try calling his security detail again? Good idea. Hello, Linus. Good evening. Please, where is my husband? Are you serious? Okay, Linus. Okay, thank you. Is Dad okay? Yes, I'm going to get him. Can I come with you? Sorry, love. It's late. Please go to bed. Ah... -[Iffy] It's massive, isn't it? -Intimidating. -Did they hassle you at the gate? -No. Hmm, Grandpa and Grandma weren't so lucky. Ooh, Mom's in trouble! [laughs] [sighs] Toju, we are officially the first family of this state. Yeah, and I'm the first dude of the state. [scoffs] There's no such thing, dumbo. Where are the first parents? Um, Mom went to get Dad. I think he's at the old house. -At Thorburn? -Yeah. What's he still doing at Thorburn? [scoffs] Adults. I'll never understand them. Anyway, come and show me around! Yeah, let's start with the kitchen. With any luck, we'll get something to eat. -Great! I'm starving. -As in, like... [phone buzzing] [grunts] Hello? Please, I'll call you back. Bye. How long have you been here? Oh... about an hour. What are you doing here? I came to be with my husband. [chuckles] Sorry. It's all just been so overwhelming. I don't know how you've managed. The only thing that has gotten me through everything is... the thought of coming back home to you, David. I feel so cut off, left out, powerless. -Honey. -Yeah? Up to 15 million people in this state look up to me for leadership and protection. Thirty-two commissioners and special advisers look up to me for leadership. Yet I turn to jelly when I'm in your arms. Tell me, who has the real power? -Hmm? -[chuckles] Hmm? Are we in a hurry to leave? That depends. What did you have in mind? [David] Wow. -It's huge. -Mm-hmm. So this will be our home for the next three years, then? No. We will live here for the next three years. Our home will always be 24 Thorburn Drive. Okay? All right. [phone buzzes] Henry? What's wrong? Send the address to my security team. I'll meet you there. What is it? A building collapsed on the Marbero housing estate. Goodness. Where are you going? I'm coming with you. Come on. -[birds chirping] -[cutlery clattering] -[David] Quite an adventure last night. -[Angela] Oh, yes. I'm glad it worked out. I was nervous giving that boy mouth to mouth. Can you imagine if it hadn't worked? Oh... You're a trained dentist. You have more than a rudimentary knowledge of first aid. Morning, Mom. Morning, Dad. Um, sorry, I can't stay for breakfast. I have to do a quick download at Kunle's, so, yeah. Yeah. [chuckles] What was that all about? I think our son has discovered the opposite sex. -[chuckling] -Hmm... Good morning, Commissioner. Please, have a seat. So what can I do for you? Your Excellency, I just came to apologize about last night. Again? Yes, ma. I needed you to understand, ma. My father was hospitalized earlier that day and-- Oh, really? I thought it was the midnight traffic that delayed you. Yes, ma, his hospitalization also affected my schedule. Commissioner, by all accounts, arriving late or not at all to emergency situations is a recurring theme. -Ah, no... -Which is understandable, given the distance between the state university, which you frequent in the early hours of the morning, and the city, where most of these emergencies happen. Your Excellency... Commissioner, your private life is your own business. But compromising the lives of the citizens of this state is mine. Do we understand one another, Commissioner? Do we understand one another, Commissioner? Yes, Your Excellency. Now, please walk out. Leave. Take your file and go. I don't have time for nonsense. Please. [murmuring] Sit down. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. [all] Good morning, Your Excellency. I'd like to address the vexed question of a cabinet reshuffle. Will I be reshuffling this cabinet or not? Yes, I can confirm that I will be reshuffling this cabinet. [theme music playing]
