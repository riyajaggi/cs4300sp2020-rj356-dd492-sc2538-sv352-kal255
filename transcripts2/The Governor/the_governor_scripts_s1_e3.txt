 {\an8}What's the matter? {\an8}I'm going to lose the election. {\an8}I'm a nobody. {\an8}I don't ever want to hear you talk like that, Ifeoma. {\an8}I'm sorry, Mom. It's just that... {\an8}it seems like I've challenged the way things have always been done. {\an8}And on top of it, I'm a girl. {\an8}Oh, that's just stupid. {\an8}But we invested time and effort {\an8}into the Youth in Politics event on your campus. {\an8}Yeah, they enjoy the visits, the free food, the publicity. {\an8}But it's a boys' club, Mom. {\an8}Everyone thinks I'm stupid to challenge Jide Thomas. Now listen to me.

 Do you want this? Yes. Do you believe you've got what it takes to improve the lives of the students? -Yes. -And are you doing this for the right reasons, not just for popularity? All I want to do is help people. I want to serve, just like you, Mom. Then fight. Debate the issues and ignore the disadvantage. Even if you lose, at least you know you fought for the good of the students and the political process. -You're awesome, Mom. -[Angela chuckles] [Iffy] Thanks. Now, I know it's been a while, but I can still make a mean hot chocolate. -Any takers? -Me, me, me! [man 1 shouts, indistinct] [man 2] Say your name. Tell your family members to bring the sum of 10 million. And tell them to bring it in the next four hours, or you will be a dead man. [coughs] [spluttering] Do you know who I am? -[grunts] -[man 2] Say your name! Tell your family members to bring 10 million, or you will die! [coughing] Listen, I am Henry Duke, chief of staff for the Savannah State government. [man 2] Lies! You are a liar! [theme music playing] -Gentlemen. -Has everything been taken care of? Oh, yes, sir. The First Lady has been put under observation, and she'll be kept sedated unless you say otherwise, sir. I have asked the air-ambulance crew to stand down. I've been trying to get in contact with Henry, but his phone seems switched off. Ah, it's better Henry doesn't know for the moment. That works in our favor. Wait, wait! Check my wallet! -Check my wallet. -Check his pockets. Check my wallet. Look at my ID. You idiots! Do you know who you're messing with? I will have you locked up for the rest of your lives. Leave him. [coughing] Fagbo. We have a problem. And the hospital staff? All taken care of, sir. I'm sure they'll keep their mouths shut. -And, Musa. -Yes, sir? I will hold you personally responsible if the press or any member of the party should hear about this before we announce it to them officially. -Do you understand? -Quite clearly, sir. Now you can leave us. He's only one man. There's only so much he can do. Oh, don't worry. Everything is under control. We will have to delay the announcement of Peter's death until after Angela resigns. Gentlemen, please, can't we speed this up? No, we cannot! It's not as if what we're doing is lawful. But we can't keep Peter's death a secret for a very long time. Then she will bring a letter to me this morning. And she will announce her resignation in a press conference, 2:00 p.m. today. [scoffs] In seven hours, Savannah State will be ours? And so will the Chinese deal. Gentlemen, I'm cautiously optimistic. -Celebrations may be in order. -Precisely! -[chuckles] -But not in this room, I hope. Um, of course not. We have to respect the dead. You know, about your campaign... I think there's an easier way to reach the students. What do you mean? Social media. I mean, it's obvious when you think about it. What do you mean? How about we go viral with your campaign? Yeah, but how? Um, we will record your campaign speech, then we'll post it on all social-media platforms. We'll hype it, you know, music, graphics, everything. It will go viral in hours, trust me. Yeah, but, Toju, there's no time. No, no, no. Leave all that to me, okay? I'm going to come up with a social-media campaign that will make Jide Thomas cry like a baby. Hey, Kunle. Yeah. Yeah. You know what we were talking about? I think I have an idea. [line beeps] [Toju] Ready in five, four... Shh! Three, two... Hi. My name is Ifeoma Ochello. But my friends call me Iffy. [Diane] Ready to eat? It's the yam and the special egg that you like. [Gbenga] Maybe later. What's the matter? [sighs] -It's that Angela issue. -Oh. Maybe I should go and see her. Are you sure? I am her mother! She needs me at a time like this. She's not 16 anymore, Diane. If I hadn't been there for her when she was 16, no doubt she wouldn't be deputy governor today. Yes, so back off. Let her handle her own problems. So you can help her, right? Let's just be grateful she still feels she needs me. [phone buzzing] Hi. My name is Ifeoma Ochello. But my friends call me Iffy. It is so easy to look at our challenges and feel overwhelmed. But this is not about me or Jide Thomas. This is about whether you want change or more of the same. This is about fighting for what's right for all of us, not just a few of us. It is about strengthening the Youth in Politics initiative, so that we all can play a part in shaping our society. The issues we have to tackle require the combined efforts of both men and women. Women have a lot to offer. They are politicians, doctors, engineers, captains of industry. They are strong, smart and capable. Choose a candidate based on merit, not just on mere popularity or gender. To do otherwise, would be a reflection of our collective apathy towards change and progress. I was ready to give up this fight, until my mother, my hero, challenged, inspired and encouraged me. She told me to debate the issues and ignore the obstacles. She reminded me that this is about you, not me, not Jide Thomas. My name is Ifeoma Ochello. And I'm running for social secretary. [phone rings] Okay. Let her in. Friday, she's here. Make yourself scarce. Yes. [indistinct chatter] Good morning. -Oh, good morning, Angela. -Good morning, Angela. Good morning, Angela. It's nice to see you in a good mood. Thank you. -You should read it. -Ah, no need. We're all friends here. You should read it, all the same. [chuckling] What is the meaning of this? Good day, gentlemen. What is it? Uh, wait! [splutters] Can you imagine? -What's wrong? -She reneged on the agreement! Why did she do that? She didn't resign, Friday. She screwed us all. Fine. -Musa. -[Musa] Yes, sir? Make sure Magdalen comes off her sedative, and get her released from the hospital. -Yes, sir. -Do it discreetly. Then leak the news that Peter is dead to the press. -Excuse me, ma'am. -Ah, Lola, what is it? Um, ma'am... Has anybody spoken to Henry? He hasn't been taking his calls. -But, ma'am... -Lola, what is it? It's the press, ma'am. I have no interest in speaking to the press. -What are you doing? -We are presently at the government house, where we're trying to confirm a report that Governor Peter Akale is dead. What? -[whistling] -Hi, Ekanem. Oh. So, what were the final results? Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. I'll talk to you later. Well? Jide had 700 votes. And I had 580. Oh, you lost? Oh, man! I'm so, so sorry. Five hundred and eighty! Do you know what that means? Uh, no, I don't. Despite Jide's popularity, connections, and my gender, he only won by 120 votes. As Dad would have said, "He may have won the battle, but not the war." Oh! Oh, I get it now! -So it's only a matter of time now. -Exactly! -The change has just begun! -Yes! -I'm so proud of you. -Thank you! It was all your idea. -[man] David. -Hey. Hi, man. Why haven't you been answering your phone? Oh... I'm sorry. I-- I switched it off. Ah... I didn't want to be disturbed. I'm revising the abstract for the conference. So, what's so urgent? Haven't you heard the news? -What? News? -[phone rings] Sorry, that's Angela. Hi, love. David, honey, at last. Oh, my God. I've been calling and calling. Yeah, I'm sorry. My phone was-- I don't have time to explain. But just turn on the TV. -Watch the news. -Four, three, two, one... [TV clicks on] [reporter] We're here, live, with former deputy governor Angela Ochello, who has agreed to comment on the death of former governor Peter Akale. It's a huge shock. We were all expecting him to make a full recovery and return to work. There are conflicting reports about the time of death. Akale's dead? [Angela] It's a very difficult time, as you can imagine. That is what I've been trying to tell you. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time. Commiserations and congratulations are in order, as you take over as chief executive of the state. -[Angela] Thank you. -[reporter] What are your key priorities? To build on Peter's legacy, and ensure a smooth transition. But make no mistake, it's not business as usual. You, my friend, just became the First Husband of the state. [sighs] [laughing] -Oh, Banky! -Oh, Gbenga! [both laughing] Ah, it seems we have been overtaken by time. Yes. So we need to implement our strategies sooner rather than later. -I've had words in some ears. -And? They feel Angela is capable and has promise. -But? -She's inexperienced. Oh, she'll learn, like we all did. Angela is as stubborn as me and her mother put together. But she's wise. She knows when to listen. Good. And the sweetener? Ah! Three special-adviser slots, one commissioner, one board chairmanship. [both chuckle] They already have one commissioner slot and two board appointments, even though we didn't support Peter during the primaries. For someone who's supposed to be on my side, you're driving a hard bargain for the other side, Banky. I am both a messenger and your friend, Gbenga. Time is of the essence. Give me something to fight your corner with. The other factions are pressing hard on me, Banky. That's politics, my friend. Politics. Well, let me see what I can do about another board appointment. And... the gratitude of the governor and her father. Oh! Well played. Well played! I'll persuade them to accept your offer. So, let's go! [both laughing] Gbenga! Banky. [both laughing] [Joyce giggling] Your Excellency! She's on the phone. -Ladies! -[Joyce] Hey! -Aw! -[laughs] We knew you would become governor. See how your security has tripled overnight. -Oh, nothing much has changed. -That's a lie and you know it. [in Pidgin] Now tell me how it happened. Linda, you're not the only one here. Joyce, sorry. [in Pidgin] Tell us how it happened. Well, there's nothing much to tell. Constitutionally, when the incumbent dies, the deputy governor automatically becomes governor. Ha! The governor is my best friend. She was my best friend first. Have you forgotten? I was the one who introduced you. Joyce, there's no need for this now. [in Pidgin] Or are we competing? I know it's not a competition. Still, I don't want people hijacking things anyhow. Please. One moment, we had everything under control. The next, she's going to make herself governor. Yes. But will screaming and shouting help it? Will it? Friday, look, in less than two years, you'll get a second chance. Two years? Are you mad? Musa, how did she find out about Peter's death before we made it public? Sir, I don't think she did. I mean, there's no way she could have known. Except there is a traitor in our midst. I don't think we have a traitor in our midst, sir. She agreed. She agreed to resign. She agreed. You're my best friend. Angela is my best friend. Now, can we just enjoy this victory, please? Hmm, okay, fine. Ah, you two will never change. -So, when is the official ceremony? -Tomorrow at 2:00. My security will have IVs delivered to you. -Nice! -I need four IVs. Why do you need four invitations? It's just a swearing-in ceremony. Well, it's not every day your best-- I mean, our best friend gets sworn in as governor. Besides, I want to invite my oga. That will intimidate him. You know, score me some points. -You're impossible. -But I'm serious. -Shameless. -I'm not shameless. -Joyce! -Yes? My oga needs to know that I also know some important people and my best friend is governor. Joyce, ah, you want to invite him and emasculate him. Something must have made her change her mind, even before Peter's death. Maybe she just changed her mind. People don't just change their minds just like that. Sir, do you think I should tap her phones, put her under surveillance? No, that would be too risky. Besides, we have to be very careful until we are absolutely sure who her supporters are. Well, unfortunately for him, he's three days late. -Three days late? -Care to explain? Well, my status has changed. We're no longer in the same category. While my level is here, his is here. Has he been made aware of your selection criteria? Not necessarily. But it will soon become clear to him that it is impossible to date someone of his status -when you're best friend to the governor. -[laughing] Sit down there. As best friend to the governor, do you know the kinds of people I'll be interacting with? Ministers, commissioners, senators, and captains of industry. Give me five! Exactly. Now who has time for riffraff? You're still seeing her daughter? It would be easier to start with the girl. When next are you seeing her? -[women laughing] -[David] Ladies! Hey, Prof, congratulations. Thank you. It was a huge surprise. I've been calling you. Oh, no worries at all. No worries. Ah, ladies, have you been wined and dined? Ah! It's shame that prevents me from packing takeaway! -Joyce! -Oh! [laughs] -Oh, please. -Behave yourself! Hey, Joyce. Please feel free. Take all you want. -Thank you, Prof. -[David] Don't mind Linda here. [laughs] Did you hear that? -So, I'll leave you ladies to it. -We were just leaving. -No, what about the grilled-- -Joyce. We were leaving. -What-- -Please, don't be strangers at all. -Huh? -Okay, Prof. Good night then, ladies. -Good night, Prof. -[David] Good night. Angie, is everything okay? -Fine, fine. Everything is fine. -Okay. -Let me see you out. -Thank you. Um, it was supposed to be tonight, but I changed my mind because of the governor. Change it again. But, um, I don't think she'll be of any use to you, because, well... You are taking her out. Honey? Find out why her mother changed her mind. Don't push her. Just fish a bit until she drops some info. Patrick can do that, you know. Yeah. Have you eaten? I thought maybe I could make that vegetable soup you enjoy. [David laughs] The governor is gonna make me vegetable soup. -David, let me explain. -Why? You're the governor. David, I tried to call you. You must have at least 30 missed calls on your phone. Yeah, you called me... to inform me of your unilateral decision to take office. David, please. Hmm? I heard about Peter's death from the press. I wasn't informed. The governor's office was besieged by media and I had to make an on-the-spot statement. I don't care, Angela. -David? -I don't care. That was your decision, not mine. But just the other day, you said you'd support any decision I made. And you said you chose us. -Your words, not mine. -And I meant it! I wrote the letter. I resigned. So what the hell changed? Iffy's speech. She said my words inspired her, David. If I could do that for her, why not for myself? Why preach it if I cannot practice it? We can still make this work. [in Pidgin] This is government business. Nothing has changed. Just the price. Fagbo, I say maybe we cut him loose. This one smells of trouble. Hmm, Friday, we need to talk. -Can't it wait till later? -No, no, I don't think it can. Fine. What is it? It's about Carl and Iffy. Look, I don't think it's right that you want to use Carl as your spy. He is not a spy. It's just to get some information, that's all. Whatever it is, Friday, I don't like it. Look, I don't think it's right for parents to bring in their children to whatever conflicts they have. It damages relationships. The only relationship Carl should be concerned about is ours. The girl is fair game. And her mother is not an honorable woman anyway. Oh, but, Friday, look, you want Carl to deceive a girl he cares about. Don't you think he would come to hate you for it someday? There is a world of difference between dating the daughter of a governor and being the son of a governor. If that is his contribution to his future, then so be it. Hey, boo. Don't "boo" me, Carl. I called you five times today, and you didn't return any of my calls. I'm sorry. Um, the governor's death really upset my father, so I had to be with him. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize they were that close. I'm sorry I missed your concession speech. -I'm sure it was great. -Mm-hmm... Which is why I'm here, actually. I want to make it up to you. So what do you say to dinner? Hmm? We'll have some wine, some peppered fish... Okay. But you're going to have to do a lot more than that to truly earn my forgiveness. -Okay. -Be back in five. Take your time. I accepted your invitation as a courtesy, gentlemen. But if the objective is to stare me to death, then I'd rather be in my bed. You didn't have to come, Gbenga. Oh, but it's customary to reach out to all the important elements of the party at the beginning of a new administration. Don't play games with us, Gbenga. Your daughter reneged on an agreement. We want to know what you will do about it. -What agreement was that? -Don't play the fool, Gbenga. She agreed to step down. Watch your tone, Jalo, when you talk to me. Who's playing the fool? Ah, come on, Gbenga. It's only a figure of speech. Your daughter actually agreed to step down for the good of the party. First, I consider it a personal insult that you broached this subject without first consulting me. I thought Angela was the deputy governor, not you. And I thought you, as an educated man, would know to let the law run its course after Peter's death. It's not that easy and you know it. -There has to be continuity. -[Gbenga] Precisely! Which is why the deputy governor is going to be sworn in tomorrow as the new governor! Oh, come on, Gbenga. But you're one of us, which is why your daughter is the deputy governor in the first place. What's done is done. We want assurances that she will allow the planned succession to follow its course by not contesting in the next elections. Oh, Angela has no intention of contesting the next election. Not so fast, Gbenga. With all due respect, your daughter cannot be trusted. We want ironclad assurances. Don't be ridiculous, Jalo. Surely you're not expecting a letter to that effect. No. We want something bolder. Something decisive. We want her to announce Friday Bello as her deputy. -[Carl] You look beautiful. -[chuckles] Thank you. Give us a little spin, sexy. [laughs] So, how does it feel being the daughter of the next governor? Ah, well, it's not official until tomorrow. -But I'm really excited. -[both laugh] You know everyone at school will be sucking up to you now. -You think? -Mm-hmm. And the lecturers too! So, um, your mom... isn't she, uh, overwhelmed by the whole idea? Well, at one point, she was thinking of resigning, but that's history now. -Really? -Mm-hmm. Do you know why she changed her mind? No, I'm not sure. Aren't you curious? I am now. I am too. [chuckles] -You tell me what she says. -Okay. -Wow! -[both laugh] [Iffy] Thank you. Gentlemen, Angela will never agree to having Friday as her deputy. And that's where you come in. You convince her to accept our terms. After all, she doesn't know the agreement between Peter and Friday. If she makes Friday her deputy, it will give her administration clout and legitimacy. [laughs] I am impressed that you can say that with a straight face. Legitimacy? Look... we are just trying to be reasonable here. If Angela makes Friday her deputy, she'll have to keep watching her back. Just tell her to make him her deputy, and there will be no trouble. I'll deliver your message. Just so we're clear, Gbenga, She appoints him as her deputy, and we let her be. If she refuses, we will make this the briefest administration that this state has ever seen. Gbenga, even with your support, there are some enemies Angela can't afford to have. Gentlemen. Thank you. Are you still angry with me? [sighs] I'm not. I'm not angry. I'm... I don't know how I'm feeling. [sighs] Honey, look... I know I messed up. We had an agreement and... I should have told you that things changed, regardless of the circumstances. I'm going to make a lot of mistakes. And I'm going to need you to watch my back, like you always have. I'm sorry I hurt you. It's okay. Now... [exhales] remind me why you love me, again. Because you're stubborn. Precisely. [chuckles] [Iffy] What's up? Nothing. Give me an apple. Well, Mom... is taking me... shopping. She's taking you shopping? Well, it's just for a decent suit to wear to the swearing-in. Mom! -Mom! -Don't... Yes, Iffy. I need something new for your swearing-in. But you already have enough clothes to choose from, Iffy. But you're taking Toju shopping. -Is it because I'm a girl? -[laughs] Nice try, young lady. But don't try playing that gender role on me. [laughs] You can't blame me for trying. But, Mom, please, can I have a new dress for your swearing-in? Come on, then. Come, we're running late. -Hurry. -[Iffy] Mm-hmm. Go! Go now, before the others come for you. Go, go, go, go... Go! -No, Toju. It's not the one. -Go back. -Go back. Go back. -It's too plain, please. -Don't mind him. -Yeah. Yes, we will get your own, Iffy. I've promised you, so, please. This isn't bad. -Toju, please. We can do better. -I like it! -Mom, I like it. -No, please. No, I'm the one who is buying it. No. Toju, please. Please, Toju, hurry now. I'm busy. Try the other one. The one you tried before. You know, at this rate, I will just let him wear his T-shirt and jeans. -Mom. -Hmm? What made you change your mind about resigning? It was you, darling. I watched your campaign speech, and I decided to take the advice of your greatest hero. -Yes! -Yeah? -Yes. [laughs] -We like it. Toju, please. Go and change. Come on, hurry up. Henry? Henry, are you okay? I was briefed about your ordeal. Are you sure you're okay? Oh... I'm glad you're safe. We've missed you, Henry. No, no, I'm at Peter's. I've come to see Magdalen. Okay, please get some rest, eh? Oh, and, Henry, I trust you will be at my side for the inauguration. Thank you, Henry. And welcome back, eh? Okay, bye. Aha! Check you out, Dad, looking all super fly, hey. You're not looking bad yourself. [both laugh] -Look at you! Huh? -Thank you. -Thank you. -My baby. -Hmm, oh! -Let's get a selfie. -Selfie time. Yes. -Yes. -You look good in this one. -[chuckles] That's right, good. Oh... -One more. -Okay. Mm-hmm. Toju! -Hurry up, we can't afford to be late. -Coming, Dad. [Iffy clears throat] Hmm! [chuckles] Who-- Who are you? And what have you done with my son? Hmm? [all laugh] We can do that. Selfie, selfie. -Okay, selfie time. -Yeah. -Smile. -Smile. [chief justice] Repeat after me. [phone buzzing] "I, Angela Ochello..." [Angela] I, Angela Ochello... "...do solemnly swear..." ...do solemnly swear... "...that I will discharge to the best of my ability..." ...that I will discharge to the best of my ability... [man, in Pidgin] You are getting old. -[in Pidgin] What do you mean? -Your eyes aren't seeing well. This is Mr. K, and not Dr. Benson. How do you mean? Is this not Dr. Benson? This will be my last time of following you here. Please let me be. "...all of my duties and responsibilities..." ...all of my duties and responsibilities... "...as the governor of this state." ...as the governor of this state. [man, in Pidgin] Why will a woman be interested in politics? Women should remain in the kitchen. You are right. Why will a woman be... -[laughing] -[in Pidgin] This is no laughing matter. Allow a woman to also rule the state for a while, let's encourage her. How do you mean? -Dad. -[indistinct chatter] You were excellent. Thank you. [theme music playing]
