Before your dad was mayor, he was the city attorney. Springer's dad is in jail because of him. You're not the publisher of this paper, Remy. As of right now, you no longer work there.

 [phone beeps] I broke up with Hanna... because of you. What did you mean about strange dealings? There's a small chapel near the west entrance. Yeah, I know it. OK, but why is he trying so hard to keep everybody out? Miranda, look. Look's like the writing from Remy's drawings. Gabriel Abaddon? [all gasp] I don't care how you picked us, we broke your damn pact. - You broke nothing! - How did this happen? He's gonna be very unhappy. He was happy to take your sister instead of me.

 Who is happy?! [grunts] [choking] Your coffee. So... you spoke to the boy? - Dillon? I spoke with him. - Mmm-hmm. - He knows what he needs to do. - He knows, but is he capable? He always seemed to lack a certain fortitude. Sometimes, Carla, we need to trust in forces greater than ourselves to provide the needed incentive. [tools clanking] [grunts] I've got this covered. I know what I gotta do. OK, I don't know who's been showing them what happened but I'll get them there before they see anything else. [yells] [giggles] You make me laugh. This kid you're describing, with the bloody tears. I followed him. He led me to Collins and Dillon in that car. What do you mean, he led you? Did he say anything? No, but I knew I was supposed to follow him. The sense that something's trying to get our attention. We all feel it, don't we? When Abaddon broke into my dream he wanted to know who was helping us. I thought he meant Miranda, now I'm not so sure. - We need to focus on Dillon. - Before he hurts anybody else. The kid with the bloody eyes; he took me to Dillon once, maybe he will again. So, we need to figure out who he is and what's he's trying to tell us. Hello, Caleb. Hi, I'm Hanna. Hanna. Um... this is Remy, Olivia and her brother Luke. [all] Hi. Where's Miranda? [cawing] Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com [door opens] [Luke] Rem, did you find him in the archives? Not yet, I'll know him when I see him. That was eight kinds of awkward. She's pretty, the girl he left behind. Thing is, the girl you leave behind isn't supposed to follow you. That invalidates the whole "left behind" part. She really loves him, you can tell by looking. Poor Miranda. Why poor Miranda? Don't be such a boy. - Uh-oh. - Uh-oh is right. Luke, look. - Is that him? - That's him. [car honks] [crickets chirping] [door closes] So, you're living above a funeral parlor. Next to it. Close enough. Hanna, why didn't you call and tell me you were coming? I like surprises. I need to talk to Miranda. I told you, Miranda doesn't live here. Which brings me back to my original question: Where is she? Look, Caleb, I mean this with all the love in my heart, I will crack your skull with a hammer if you tell me, "It's complicated." Just tell me where she is. I don't care, I won't hurt her. Much. I think that maybe you should sit down. Maybe I should stay on my feet. Miranda is dead. Among the dead, Ryan Atwater, age 17, who was attending the dance with friends. He died with four other kids, right after the Korean War. Luke... Atwater was separated from his companions who feared the worst for the teen who was blind. A blind ghost. Who can show you the past. - [door opens] - [gasps] - Hey, Dad. - [door closes] - Remy. Luke. - Mr. Beaumont. Mom called. She'll be back on Tuesday. - Good. - Let me take that for you. I've got this. Don't worry about it. He always used to leave his briefcase downstairs. Now he doesn't trust me around anything that has to do with the paper. He'll get over it. Maybe when I graduate from college. So, Miranda was dead when you came back to Rosewood and we broke up. Yes. So why did you say she needed you? Tell her. Miranda is dead. But she's not gone. She's still here. She has unfinished business with her uncle. That's what I'm helping her with. So she can move on. Do you know what it sounds like you're telling me? Yes, I do know what it sounds like. She thinks you're lying. I'm telling you the truth. [Miranda] She thinks you're crazy. For a while I thought I might be crazy, but I'm not. If you can see her, show her to me. Caleb, show her to me and I'll believe you. It's not a magic trick, Hanna. I can't make her appear. You either see her or you don't. Hanna, wait. Just stay so we can talk about this. No. Look, I need some air, and it's a little crowded in here right now. [door shuts] - Hanna? - Mrs. Grunwald. Oh, Caleb didn't mention you were coming for a visit. Um, Caleb didn't really know. I see. Who could I sue in this town for making my boyfriend crazy as a bag of cats? This must have to do with Miranda. We all were affected by her death, but Caleb seems to have felt it the most. He says he talks to her. That can be a great comfort. And she talks back to him. The veil is thinner here. You've experienced that yourself. Yeah, loose floorboards and bad wiring. [chuckles] What are you going to do? I'm going to finish this cup of coffee and get back to Rosewood. Stay. Just a little while longer. And what good would that do? What you have with Caleb, that's worth more than one afternoon, isn't it? You know, I never really thanked you. For what? For pulling Ali out of the ground. You saved her life. Come back to the house. I know your last experience was challenging, but it's different in the daylight. Think about it. [door opens] This is who I saw at The Vault. Only his eyes were... different. I sent the picture to Caleb. I thought it was Abby that showed me the lab fire at school, but maybe it was Ryan. I think you have to be in the place where the thing happened for Ryan to show you. That's why I had to go to the Carver place to see them send the pact. You ever been someplace where something historical happened and you get like a chill, just from being there? Like there was an echo of what happened. Luke, maybe he can show us what happened to Dad. [phone buzzes] Hey. Hey. I was looking for you. I was afraid that you left. I'm still thinking about it. I asked around. I know that you were telling the truth about Miranda. At least about the accident. Did you think I was lying to you about that? If you did, at least I'd know how to feel. How do you feel? I came here to fight with her and then you told me that she was dead and... I was so angry I didn't wanna let it in, this... this terrible thing that happened. Caleb, I liked her and I wanted to help her and now she's dead. And you were... you were in the car. You could have... Come here. [Remy] What about the current mayor? [Olivia] He doesn't use this office. [Luke] Nobody does. Liv, you sure you want to go in there? No, I'm not. It's exactly like Dad left it. What now? Maybe it's like the séance. We have to ask. [exhales] Ryan? Is there something you want us to see? You have that look. What look? The I have to answer that text look. Go ahead. I'll be right back. Hello. Hello. Are you alone? My friend's over there. My friend's over there. Would you like to meet her? Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to meet your friend. Then, come on. No, you stay with Olivia and Remy, I'll be there as soon as I can. I'm with Hanna right now. Hey, let me call you back. - Hanna. - Hello. You left. I was worried. You guys know each other? It's a small town. Hey, can I get you to come back with me. Yeah, In a minute, Max wants me to meet her friend. I don't think that right now's a good time for that. I've seen her before. You've seen her? Yes. In Ravenswood, at a party in the cemetery. I saw her and her friend. OK, I need you to walk away with me and do not look back. Caleb, she's just a little girl. OK, where the hell did she go? You don't want to know. Caleb, you're either lying or you're crazy, but whatever it is, don't treat me like an idiot. Understand? So, Miranda, here I am. You know, I would've come sooner only I just found out. I put some flowers on your grave, but I wasn't going to stand out there talking to myself. People do that in old movies, talk to gravestones in cemeteries. I always thought it looked cheesy and... it feels just as stupid doing it here. So, have you met any famous dead people yet? Cleopatra? Marilyn Monroe? Anyone like that? I'm sorry. You're dead. This isn't funny, I shouldn't be making jokes. No, please, make jokes. I miss jokes. You have to understand, if I don't make jokes I'll cry because I don't believe any of this. When you're dead you're dead, so Caleb's delusional. Maybe he feels guilty that he couldn't save you. I told him to take care of you when this happened. [scoffs] I'm sure he feels terrible. - It would make him crazy. - No, don't say that. He's not crazy. God, what am I saying? Caleb's not crazy. He made you a promise and he's trying to keep it. He's a good boy who keeps his word. You don't get that every day. When he came back to Rosewood... the things he was saying, I was sure that he was in love with you. Really? What did he say? He was talking about how you needed him and how he'd made promises. [exhales] I know how much he loves you. Don't ask me how. [chuckles] I just do. But you need to leave so he knows that you're safe. That's what he needs right now. I'll protect him till he can come back to you. I promise. I know all about promises. Caleb taught me. Thank you for the flowers. [Luke] I don't think anything's gonna happen. Liv. It was a long shot. [Olivia] It's Ryan, he's here. I'm sorry, too, Chelle. I don't want every conversation we have to end like this. Just put something on a plate and leave it in the oven for me. I'll be home as soon as I can. Rochelle. I love you. [hangs up phone] Dad? [Remy] He did know about that pact. [Dillon] Mr. Matheson? Dillon. What are you doing here? I'm sorry it had to work out this way. How did you get in here? Luke, do something! I don't wanna die. - [screams] - No! No! [crying] Mom's coat. - Let go. Let go of me! - Shh. There's nothing we can do. There's nothing we can do. Shh. Dillon's thumbprint. In your father's blood. [slow-tempo music plays] He's talking to the cops now. Telling them what? To search the office again. They don't need a warrant, there's a crime scene. If they balk, your mom's lawyer can lean on them. They'll find the book. They can't miss it. We called, where were you? Keeping Hanna from walking away with Max the moppet from hell. - You're kidding. - In broad daylight. You need to get Hanna away from here. I'm trying. Don't tell her about Miranda. Too late. What's the name of the new lawyer? I'm gotta call him. I don't want the police to find Dillon. What? I want to find him, and I want to kill him. No, you don't. I do. So do you. That's not what's gonna happen. It's not what Dad would want. Can you stay with them? I want to find my dad. What are you going to tell him? That the police have new evidence in the murder of Mayor Matheson. He's a reporter, give him news and all is forgiven. You can just call him. Some things you text, some things you tell. [shower running] It was just a real spur of the moment thing, Em. My brain was melting, I had to get out of Rosewood. Caleb's fine. It's complicated. Hey, tell Spencer where I am, but not right away. All right, well, I'll probably be home tomorrow. OK. Bye. [Remy] Dad? [footsteps on stairs] [clattering] [dog barking] - [gasps] - Time to go. We've got a date. You're finished, Dillon. You're the ones who are finished. What are you going to do to me? The same thing you did to the mayor? [grunts] [screams] [straining] [door opens] [curtain ruffles] [curtain ruffles] [rattling] [gasps] God, somebody's in here. Hanna, are you taking a bath? No, I'm baking a cake. What do you think I'm doing? Listen, it's really important you get out of that tub. - Well, I'm relaxing. - Hanna, you can relax somewhere else. Hanna, please. We have to talk. Please. [scoffs] Fine. [phone buzzes] I'll be right back, Hanna. Remy Beaumont is missing. What do you know about it? What makes you think I'd know anything? Because there's a very straight line from Dillon to Springer to you. You think Dillon took the Beaumont girl? I don't have time for this. You know exactly what's going on, you've always known. There was a Collins when the deal was made. There's always been a Collins, taking orders, snipping hair, keeping those souls in escrow for somebody. My family has kept this town safe for a hundred years. By killing kids every time somebody goes to war? No Collins has ever harmed a soul. No, you only keep them in a jar for somebody. You can't possibly understand. The mayor figured it out. That's why you sent Dillon in there to kill him. Dillon did what? Stabbed the mayor. Dillon had the knife all this time? You didn't know. No, I don't need you to tell me to calm down... Dillon did this. Why go after Remy first? She's the one who had face time with the preacher. And it's a way to get back at me. You stay here, I'm going after him. Like hell I'm staying here. Olivia, don't give me a hard time right now, all right. - [phone beeps] - Wait, it might be from Caleb. Liv, what? It's from Remy's phone. The Collins men have always been undertakers. That's why we've always been the ones to keep the Children of the Pact. Hold their essence, in those jars, till the contract was complete. You could've changed this. My sister thought she could change it and she's dead. Charlie Matheson thought he could end the curse and got a knife in his chest. Whoever questions this gets the same answer: Death. You did try to change it. You sent Miranda away and when she came back you tried to scare her off. You have no idea what that was like. My sister's child. The last living connection I had in this world and I slammed the door in her face. And then she was gone. [inhales] These things were done before we arrived on the scene. They are beyond our ability to influence. Caleb. Leave him alone. *** found the names. Remy took it. It's from her phone, but we don't know if she sent it. We know that's where she is. What are we waiting for? It could be a trap. Nothing can happen to me, but you guys still have something to lose. Dillon's got Remy, I'm not passing up a chance to break his neck. We can handle him. If it's just Dillon. [Olivia] Her phone. [door locks] Luke! Don't break his jaw till he tells us where Remy is. Where's Remy? Huh? Tell me. Tell me! - [groaning] - Remy! [Remy] Olivia? [panting] We got her. - Let's get out of here. - I don't think so. [electricity crackling] Well done, my good and faithful servant. It's Abaddon. I told you the debt would be repaid. But we're one short. No... we're not. My bad penny. Come, stand next to Caleb, let me see the lovely couple re-united. I know what you want. And I can give it to you. She wants her life back. Can you give her that? I have the authority. Death for you, Miranda, it need not be permanent. We know that every deal you broker comes with a price. You misunderstand me. I'm not here to bargain. [chanting in a foreign language] What is that? It's the language they used to make the pact. [gasps] [coughing] Miranda?! No! [grunting] [screams] [chanting continues] I can feel her. She's ice cold but I can feel her. Whatever he's doing, it's bringing her back to us. [panting] Shut up! I did everything I was supposed to do. That's why I'm going to help you get away. I like you, Dillon. You bought me ice cream. Come on. [grunts] [groans] [coughing] [train approaching] [horn blows] [straining] [chanting in foreign language] Abaddon? You are not needed nor welcome here! I won't let you do this to her. You shopkeeper. You clerk. You janitor of souls. You do not have a say in this. Leave her alone! He's helping her. He needs her alive to take the rest of you. For a minute I was me again. He was bringing her back because you all need to die together. That's the payment due. And I've come to collect. [grunts] [chants in foreign language] - Get out of here! - No, there has to be something we can do. - There isn't. - We not giving up that easy. Neither am I. You were wrong, Abaddon. I do have a say in this. I'm willing to let this one go. Then you know what I'll have to do. I'm not scared of you anymore. Because I understand why you brought them here. You're too weak to kill them without the evil you feed from in this chapel. What I've hoped for all these years is true. The two of them, together, are more powerful than you are. [all gasp] Do you guys smell that? Roses. I'm sorry. I thought I was protecting you all. She can come back. But not this way. Who was that? Who did you set free? Caleb Rivers. Can I ask you something? Sure. Do you believe me? I don't know what I believe. I know what the smart thing would be. But I don't think that the smart thing will make me as happy as you do. What are you going to tell the others? Nothing. We know how to keep secrets. There's nobody like you in the entire world. That's true. Keep that in a safe place. Don't lose it. I won't. [engine starts] ♪ Do you want me on you mind ♪ ♪ Or do you want me to go on? ♪ ♪ Am I... ♪ ♪ Is this yours, I can say? ♪ ♪ But can't be far away ♪ Miranda? Is it really you? Caleb...? I can feel you. [Caleb] Everyone says we're too young to know what we want. - But I've known. - [Miranda] I promised to love, honor and cherish you... for eternity.
