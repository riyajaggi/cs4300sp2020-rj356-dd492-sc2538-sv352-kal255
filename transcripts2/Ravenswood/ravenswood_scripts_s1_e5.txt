 Previously on Ravenswood. I'm looking for Mr. Rivers. I think we're family. He never signed it. He lost the battle. Who? Who are you talking about? You must know what you're up against, boy. It's your turn now. These keys are official. There's a county stamp on them. It's faded but it's there. So you think that one of these keys fits into a door in your school? Miranda, what are you looking for?

 That. He doesn't wanna come near me when I'm alive but thinks he can keep some of me when I'm dead?! Why are you keeping pieces of her in this room? What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about! We are on to you. So is Miranda. I kissed Tess today. What? Mom? Mom? Is this heaven? It's where you're supposed to be.

 Hey, sleepyhead. Dad? You hungry? I made you chocolate chip pancakes. They used to be your favorite. I can stay, right? I don't have to leave? We're your family, Miranda. Where else would you go? I feel so normal here. That's because you're home. If there's anything else you need, just let us know. All that's for me? I've never had more than a few outfits before. You'd be surprised at how many looks you can create out of a ten-piece wardrobe. We didn't want to leave you. I know, mom. Miranda? What is that? Max likes to play hide and seek. Is she my sister? We found her playing in the yard. We don't know how she got here, but we're taking care of her. Hi. I'm Miranda. Max doesn't talk. But she will soon. Hope you girls are hungry. I love you. I love you, too. I really do. Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com Miranda thinks she's safe. But she isn't. That little girl wants to hurt her. Are you sure that's not just what it sounds like... a bad dream? You don't have to be here if you don't want to, Luke. I called your sister, not you. This happened once before. Miranda came to me to show me that thing on the bridge, and this felt as real as that. You said she was with her parents. They must be in a safe place. I don't think that they know what this little girl is. And what is she? I'm not sure. So all of this stuff was in Henry's box? Who's "S. L."? It's who drew the map in 1918, signed his initials next to the date. Who is he? That's the year Caleb and Miranda died. The original Caleb and Miranda. How's this stuff supposed to help us know what we're up against? Hey... Henry said he never signed it, and I think he's talking about this letter. I think it's from Caleb to Miranda. The original Caleb and Miranda. I don't think they ever gave it to her. It's not even finished. What does it say? Everyone says we're too young to know what we want, but I've known since I first saw you. When we're not together, I feel like I'm missing a part of me. I'm worthless without you. I breathe, but... I don't exist. Miranda. I don't know if hearing that makes me happy or sad. Was Caleb writing Miranda to see if she felt the same way? Maybe it didn't matter. Is this a map of Ravenswood? Or I thought a plot of land somewhere. It's a box of questions, not answers. This is where she is. That's Miranda's room from my dream. Are you sure? Yes, that's her bed and... and the same wallpaper. Henry would know where this is. Collins needs me at the house. So, I'm thinking that we should all meet in a few hours. We can all take a drive to the nursing home. Um... All four of us in a car together? We can't avoid it forever, Liv. You know what? I don't think I'm gonna take this to the house. I'll keep it safe. All right, I'll see you guys later. Listen, I know you have to get to work, but can we talk for a minute? My dad needs me to call him. I'm supposed to be working right now. Okay. You coming? Is this about Dillon or the curse? It's about I'm in the mood for some snicker doodles. For breakfast? Brunch. Live, I gained 10 pounds after dad died. If you're starting another baking bender, I'm out. You say that now. Do you want to talk about it? It's my fault. Not hers. What'd you do? I was honest about something that I should have kept to myself. Something you screwed up? Yeah. I definitely screwed up. You didn't get a few points for telling Remy about it? I'm starting to think the truth's overrated. You're lucky you can be honest. Some of us don't have that luxury. Dillon thinks you're trading him in for your new friends. Did he tell you that? Well, no, but you can see how it looks to him. You're always blowing Dillon off for Caleb and Remy. I'm not blowing him off. I'm protecting him. Dad found out about the pact, and it got him killed. You and Remy might be going through something, but at least you're in this together. Liv. You've always been the optimist. If I've got to be the one to start cheering people up, it's gonna get pretty dire around here. We're all handling it the way we need to. Yeah, well, you're handling it by not handling it. There's nothing wrong with wanting to feel normal. I don't even know what that means anymore. No. No, no, no. I'm sorry for your loss. He looks terrified. I'm sure he was. What did you say? I've seen it before. He was scared to death. Remy, I've never seen anything like it. How can we find out what happened? Do you think Collins knows? When he said he was scared to death, he meant it. Hey, let me call you back. Okay. Mr. Collins is working through lunch, and I presumed that you would take yours here. I'm not a guest anymore. I work here. You don't need to bring me my lunch. I like taking care of people. I hope you enjoy it. Hmm... Do you recognize that place? No. Should I? You're looking for Miranda, aren't you? You should think of what she wanted the most. That was to be with her family. Then Miranda may have found her way to their home. Wasn't that the Collins house? No. Miranda's father was a teacher. And after the wedding, they moved closer to the college. I'm sure we still have the address. If you're interested. I'm interested. I'll get it for you. ♪ One wall at a time ♪ ♪ you never cry ♪ ♪ All those tears were mine ♪ ♪ would you stay around this time? ♪ - Hey. - Hi. I've been calling you all morning. Can we not start like this? Please. You're right. I'm sorry. I worry, that's all. With everything that's happened. I know I haven't been around as much lately, but I'm fine. Really. I miss you, Liv. I miss you, too. What's in the box? It's just some old stuff. Whose old stuff? It's Caleb's. Why am I not surprised? All roads lead back to Caleb. It's not like that, Dillon. You don't have to be jealous. Then what is it like? He's alone, okay? He doesn't have anybody. He seems to have you. That doesn't mean you don't. So why do you have it? It belonged to a relative of his. He passed away this morning. He really wanted Caleb to have it. He's trying to figure out why. ♪ Would you stay with us tonight? ♪ Maybe I can help. Let's look through it together. Do you want something to eat? Yeah. ♪ 'Cause I'm yours to keep if you want ♪ Hey. I'm not stalking you, I promise. But I really do wanna finish what we started last night. You were pretty clear. I don't need to hear anymore. I didn't mean to take any of it out on you. I really didn't. Stop trying, okay? If you want to help us with what we were talking about this morning, I'm fine with that. But I am not your girlfriend anymore. Next in line. Great, an empty lot. It's a shame he had to go like that. He knew it was coming. Caleb is looking for Miranda. You need to do it tonight. Hey. How can you be so close yet so far away? What do you mean? I mean, we talk, but you don't really say anything. Um, there's not much to say. Miranda's Uncle's a jerk, and I'm trying to help her get out of Ravenswood. Are you bringing her home with you? I don't think so. Well, I can't say I'm happy about it. I mean, she's nice and everything but... Hanna... I love you. Now you don't seem so far away. I don't think this is a map. You remember that drafting class I took at Cicero college? Yeah, I hardly saw you last summer because of it. See these numbers? It's a scale factor. One inch on the page equals ten feet of actual space. So this is a blueprint? And this note at the top, negative elevation. It's a basement somewhere. Maybe SL was the architect. No results. You said Remy's been helping you with this, right? Yeah, it's too late to call her, though. I can try tomorrow, see if she can find anything at the paper. I'd like to talk to her, too. Would you be okay with that? Was that a yes? I think I need to hear it again. You know, I was gonna surprise you, but I know you... hate surprises. I made a reservation this weekend for Ravenswood Inn. For who? For me and you. You know, I thought that if things are so complicated with Miranda that you can't come see me, then... I'll just come to you. That's a long drive for a meal. I'm not going for the food, Caleb. I'm coming to see you. Hey, you know what? I have a better idea. Why don't you make a rez at the Apple Rose Grill? Really? I'm coming home. You promise? I promise. Well, do you wanna bail on the restaurant and just eat take-out and cuddle? Like Teddy bears? What is so funny? Nothing. You saying "Teddy bears." It just makes me laugh. Say it again. No, that's not gonna happen. Come on, just one more time. No. I promise that I won't laugh. Teddy bears. Okay, I'm hanging up now. Caleb... I love you. I love you, too. Caleb. Caleb. You're in danger. That little girl Max, she wants to hurt you. What? No, she's just a lost little girl. Miranda, this is a dream. Okay, like this room isn't even real. Max? Miranda... You can leave here. This is the way out. Are you okay, Max? I'm where I want to be. And you can go now. Miranda. Do you want to sleep in here with me? Okay. Miranda. So you've been sleepwalking since the accident and you didn't think you should tell me this? You can't handle your own truth. Why would I think you could handle mine? I've always been there for you, Remy. Were you there for me when you were kissing Tess? You kissed Tess? Liv, please. Look, whatever you guys are dealing with, you're gonna have to get over it. 'Cause whether you like it or not, we're in this together. All of us. So if you guys wanna try to find a way to beat this, we need all hands on deck. I'm really sorry, Remi. Okay, so when I woke up down here, I felt like I was standing in the right place. Like someone had led me here for a reason. Miranda visits Caleb. Maybe she's in your dreams, too. Uh, maybe we should just look around. We know Joe's vault used to be the bank, right? Yeah, it was the Ravenswood savings & loan. It was the first bank on main street, built in 1918. How do you guys know these things? It was relocated to the first mall in Ravenswood. I wrote a paper about it when the new mall became the old mall. Once again we're talking about the year original Miranda and original Caleb died. You mean the year they were murdered. So you believe it now? That they died because of the curse? I can't make it go away unless I accept that it's real. So welcome to the new normal. Check this out. The drawing that was in the box, it's not a map, it's a blueprint. And it wasn't signed by S & L. It's the floor plan of the S & L. We're standing in the basement of the old savings and loan. I think you're right. What? Are you surprised to know where we are? Or that I figured it out? I think a little of both. I read more than just style magazines. All right, so we're in an old bank, but why? It's just a moldy old room. Yeah, but in the drawing there were two rooms, not one. This was a doorway, not a wall. Guys, there's another room behind here. You have to hurry. Oh, my God. This wall was built from the inside. They did this to themselves. It doesn't look like they brought any food or water down here. It's because they didn't want to linger. They came here to die. A big hairy spider! It was crawling up my arm! Ugh! We're in a room with two skeletons and that is what freaked you out? I hate spiders. This ring's identical to the one that we found in Henry's box. I think this is a letter from Miranda to Caleb. "My dearest Caleb..." It was only the day we met that I understood the meaning of eternity. So on this day, with our friends as witness, I promise to love, honor, and cherish you. But not until death do us part. For eternity. I don't think these are letters. They're wedding vows. Caleb and Miranda were married by a ship's Captain. Original Caleb and original Miranda were killed in a boating accident. With three of their friends. They died on their wedding day. Guys... There's stuff in here about the curse. Their names are Thomas and Esther. They thought if they sacrificed themselves, they could bring Caleb and Miranda back. And that Caleb and Miranda could reverse the curse. You mean back to life? That's crazy. Is it possible it worked? Their sacrifice? I don't think it's a coincidence anymore that both you and Miranda look exactly like your long lost relatives. Whoa, guys. I am not original Caleb. I'm me. Maybe you were original Caleb and now you're back. Okay, I see where you're going with this, but I'm not that guy. And Miranda is not that girl. When I met her on the bus, my heart didn't go pitter-pat. I have a girlfriend and I love her. Caleb, I don't know if I believe in any of this stuff. But if these people were willing to do this to themselves, they must have had some insight into something we don't know. I mean, what if it's true? What if you did know each other? Maybe then we all don't have to die. Luke said they brought them back so that they could break the curse. Look, I am in this with you. And I want every one of us to live through it. But I don't think that Miranda and I are the chosen ones. Okay? She's just a girl that I met on the bus a week ago. And now she's dead. Well, maybe that's part of it. Maybe we just found out why she can't move on. This must be original Miranda's house. Grunwald said she might be looking for her family home. Maybe that's what she found. Isn't that the creepy old house on saw mill road? The one we used to run by when we were kids. We thought it was haunted. Who's driving? Okay, that's weird. Is it me or did it just drop, like, 20 degrees in here? It's freezing in here. Looks like they left hundred years ago in a hurry and never came back. How is this thing still ticking? Don't you have to wind these? Okay, there's creepy, then there's if I pee my pants no one's allowed to make fun of me. Miranda? Miranda! She didn't bring you here. I did. Do you know where Miranda is? She's waiting for you. In hell. It won't open! It's locked! Where did she go? I don't know what that little girl is, but I know what she isn't, and that is a human. Miranda! This is some kind of trap. Miranda didn't bring us here. It did. We need to find a way out before it comes back. I'm not leaving here until we look for Miranda. You heard what Luke said. This was a trap. Like I said... Everybody's sticking together. ♪ Ring around the Rosie ♪ ♪ pocket full of posies ♪ ♪ ashes, ashes ♪ ♪ we all fall down ♪ Wanna play? Miranda! How are all of you here? Are you dead? Miranda, this is not heaven. They hijacked your thoughts or something. You are seeing what you want to see, not the truth of this place. What? No, Caleb, my parents are here. They'll be right back. You'll see them. She's coming! Miranda, how do we get out of here?! You know how this is gonna end. What was that? We gotta get out of here. We gotta get out of here! In my dream, there was a door in this closet. I think it's the way out. It's a pretty far drop. But if I go first, I can help you guys. Come on. Remy, come on. Miranda, come on. Let's go. I... I can't. Yes, you can. Trust me. Please. This whole thing was a trap, Miranda. Those things are not your parents. They're like that thing that you saw on the bridge. Come on! Hurry! You have to come with me, Miranda. If we don't leave now, we can never be together again. You see her, right? You see my mom? No. When I was three, you taught me how to ride a bike. Do you remember that? Of course. It was such a big moment for you. I never learned how to ride a bike. My parents died before they could teach me. It doesn't have to be real for you to be happy. Yes, it does. Come on, man. Come on. Caleb? Hey. Come on. I can feel you. How did we bring you back? You didn't. You're with me now. I'm dead? I think there's still time for you to go back. No, really, Caleb, if you don't go back now... it's okay. I can't explain it, but it feels right being here with you. It's not right yet, but I know it will be. We have a heartbeat. Well, his vitals are stabilizing, and he doesn't seem to have any permanent injuries. It's a miracle after taking a fall like that. I'm glad you called me. Will you stay until he comes to? Well? They're still alive. Hey, how about some coffees for everybody? That would be great. Thanks, Dillon. I'll be right back. Okay. After all we did to get them in that house. How did this happen? Their connection is stronger than I thought. He's gonna be very unhappy. Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com
