 Previously on Ravenswood. The cops need to know about this, mom. Because they've been so helpful to us. They found a knife in our yard. Like this. I saw you holding the knife you used to kill Luke's dad. I'm the deal maker not the murderer. Promises were made. This townhouse is packed. Let's go. You should not have seen,

 You're going to wish you were dead before this is over. What were you doing with Mr. Collins? Who do you think helped me find a lawyer so quickly? I don't want you by yourself if that freak Collins is coming to your house. I told my brother I would be safe with you. You are safe with me. I'm not the one you have to worry about pleasing. Before your dad was mayor, he was a city attorney. Spinger's dad is in jail because of him. (car honks) Springer! Why did you put that knife in my yard? He made me do it. Dillon.

 Shall we test it? You brought a can of spray paint. Who replaced it? Mr. Collins. He said it was a gift. And evidently, it's got some kind of coating on it that resists vandalism. I bet your dad would've loved to have some of that sprayed on him when he was running for mayor. What did Collins do with the old one? Dad's headstone? Who knows. I hope he made a sled out of it. Next winter, we could honor your dad and drag it up to the top of Pinecrest Hill. We'll all pile on and push off. He would've loved that. You know, when we were still dating, he took me up there after a blizzard. Insisted that we take that hill stark naked. Are you serious? He never mentioned that on the campaign trail. Or the frostbite he had in very delicate areas.. Mrs. Matheson? Who're you? I'm Detective Scarpelli. I've been assigned to your husband's case. Why're you here? What is this about? I'm here to place you under arrest, ma'am. What? You can't do this here! ROCHELLE: Guys don't. We knew this could happen. Call Karen Lescher, then Uncle Rob. - Mom...  - It's going to be fine. Luke, take your sister home. We're coming with you, all right? Sync by wilson0804 Corrections by chamallow www.addic7ed.com I told them who they should be talking to is Springer. Why is no one going to the hospital and asking about what's on his phone? Are you sure you want them to hear that? I don't know what's going on with Dillon, but he has no reason to hurt us. So then why isn't he here? - How come he's not texting you back? - I don't know. I don't know where he is, his mom won't even give me a straight answer. "You're going to wish you were dead." What... ? What did you say? I didn't say it. The drunk said it to me. Remy heard that in her dream. It was on her drawing. What're you talking about? She heard even more at the clinic. That preacher said, it's not "random." "Debts are owed." Think about it. We were supposed to die, but we didn't, and now the people we care about are disappearing one by one. Look. What's he doing here? We've been standing out here the whole time, - did you see him go in? - No. Hello. What are you doing here? How did you know about this? Her attorney called me. Can I drop you off at home? We're not going anywhere. Well, neither is she. Why? She hasn't done anything! Our mother did not kill our father! That'll be proven. Mr. Collins? May I speak with you? Why is he here? Remy should've asked that preacher if Collins is the one that put Springer up to this! So that he could swoop in and be her savior? I don't know. You can see your mother now. What're you doing here? It's your first day. Thought you might like to see a friendly face. Thank you, but I think I've got it covered. And there's not a evil preacher teaching Spanish lab. Well, you never know. Actually, I do. Her name is Se?ora Gomez. I'd like to make it through my first day without you trying to clock her with a lamp. Fine. I'll sit quietly in your locker. Where is it? I have no idea. "720". Better hurry. You're already tardy. I've got a form for that, too. Here it is. So what's our first class? Well, I can audit. History. Mr. Price. I think Luke's in class. So is Remy. Yeah, I haven't seen them today. Or Olivia. What's wrong with this stupid lock? You're nervous. Maybe your hands are sweaty. Mine were. When I had them. No, this isn't nerves. They gave me the wrong combo! Easy. You mess with school property, they'll call your dad. Fine with me. At least he'd know I was enrolled and get off my case. Um, who were you talking to? Um, my locker. Did it answer? 'Cause if it did, I could call the school nurse for you. That's funny. No, it's not. Stay out of this. Let me guess, was your last school uniform a hospital gown and booties? (both laughing) Nice. Now can you open mine next? What're you laughing at, freakazoid? The day has started, people. Are you looking for another book? Uh, no, actually I'm in your class. Then I suggest you find your seat. (police siren wails) Who decides the bail? A judge. Luke... ? Yeah. Can you sit down? No, I'm not getting comfortable in here. And you shouldn't either. Can you please go out to the car and get me my coat? Yeah. Listen to me. You need to be your brother's keeper. What does that mean? He's already had trouble with the police...  Mom, you're the one who's in trouble...  I'm innocent. He's got a temper like your father and he's lost right now and he's angry and he could do something that he'll regret...  Mom...  He's not convinced that I didn't do this to your father. That's not true. He knows...  He knows what? Nothing. Luke... ? I'm so sorry. This is my fault. You had nothing to do with this. You guys are being punished because of what I saw. Because I challenged Abaddon. I'd rather know what we're up against than not. Has Olivia heard from Dillon yet? Has anyone spoken to Springer? He's not talking. I mean, it's one thing to share with my sister. He's not going to talk with the police, there's no way. Luke, Springer wouldn't have said anything about Dillon if he wasn't ready to say more. He just needs to know it won't come back to haunt him. Who is going to promise him that? Remember where we live? (school bell rings) Caleb? Caleb... ? What? I saw you were on that during class. We have a strict policy here. Students take out their phones, we eat them. Sorry, I...  a friend of mine, his mother's in jail...  You mean Luke? They arrested her at the cemetery this morning. While she was visiting his father's grave. That family's been through so much already. Yeah, I heard you were working there. In the cemetery. How did that happen? I needed a place to stay. Mr. Collins needed someone to pull his weeds. Be careful. We just had some strange dealings with Collins. I won't be in that cemetery forever. You'll be the first. What do you mean by "strange dealings"? There's a small chapel near the west entrance...  Yeah, I know it. I've never been inside of it. Nobody has. He's keeps it locked up tight. Last year, the Historical Society asked me to take pictures of the stained glass. Collins chased me off the property. Threatened a lawsuit. He told me it was unsafe. In "disrepair." It's perfectly intact. Pristine. Then why are the doors chained shut? God knows why. When will you be here? I called the bank, Uncle Rob, there aren't enough zeroes in any of the accounts. The bail is ridiculous...  (doorbell rings) Luke's not here. Can I call you back? Hey. Can I come in? Please? I just heard about your mom. God, Livie, why are the cops in this town working overtime to...  Where have you been? You won't believe me. You're right. I probably won't. Where've you been, Dillon? My parents shipped me off, all right. 72 hours of "purification." What? Ministry camp. My mom found...  Oh, this is really embarrassing. Get past it. She found condoms in my drawer. She freaked out. My mom called the pastor, my dad took my phone, and then they sent me off into the woods "to have the devil shaken out of me." Well, here is what you missed. The weapon that killed my dad was found buried in our backyard. What? Yeah. It gets better. Zack Springer told me that you made him put it there. That's insane. Is it? There's a garbled message on his phone...  sounds like he's talking to you. Then he made that message to mess with you...  Dillon...  Why would you believe anything Springer says? Who do you think tossed that bucket of paint on you in the parade? You should've called me. You're right. I'm sorry. I should've found a way. I know you're angry. Okay, I don't blame you. But you know I'm telling the truth about Springer. I missed you so much. Please forgive me. I'm here now. Hey, Luke, how's it going? I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night. That man took the body from grave riders. I knew the woman, I knew the little dog on that grave. He killed the dog. And that's why you won't be a doctor. (door opens) Not if I have to be a party to things like that. What're you doing here? How're you feeling? Better. Does that complete our interview? I wasn't sent here by The Gazette. I'm here because of Luke and Olivia and their mom. This town has a history of jumping to conclusions. Passing judgment and locking people up before they have all the answers. Isn't that what happened to your father? What if it did? What about it? Look, if what you told Olivia is true and you and Dillon had something to do with that knife...  Visiting hours are over. Springer, if you come forward and tell your story to the cops, the right person will get punished. Just like it worked for my father? You think I did because I wanted to? You think I want to do it now? (cell phone ringing) (man continues on TV) Is this what Dillon did to you? Put you on mute? He comes back and suddenly you've lost your voice? "Comes back" from where? What makes you think he ever left? What're you saying? He's been around this whole time? Did he come to see you? Wait. What if I was sent here by The Gazette? If there was a way I could help you, would you help me? You spoke with Luke? Yeah, briefly. He thinks this is all connected to The Pact... Might be right. Just 'cause I scared Abaddon out of Remy's life doesn't mean that Luke and Olivia are off-limits. But...  what if this is just about a vindictive punk with an axe to grind? Well, that "punk" used to work for your uncle. Who's pretty good with a sharp blade himself. What if Springer threw Dillon under the bus as a distraction? Distraction from what? Collins. Maybe he's still working for him. You know, we thought we loosened your uncle's grip when we found his "secret room." But it looks like he's got another one, out by the west entrance. Caleb, I've been in that chapel. It's small, it's quiet, it's a lot like my grave. With less dirt. Then why is he trying so hard to keep everybody out? Maybe he's trying to keep something in. Can you please not drink that in front of me? What do you care? It's not like you have to hydrate. I love papaya juice. You can still crave something you can't have. So what made you go to the chapel? I have a lot of hours to fill in my day. It's not like I'm on full time bully patrol. Yeah, about that. Never again, okay? I don't need a bodyguard. That was not for you. That was for me. You don't even know them. Oh, I know them. And so do you. They just come in different hair colors and bra sizes. What did you mean by "trying to keep something in"? I don't know. It's just something I said. All right. Listen, I know you're not great with door handles, but can you blow out a window or something so I could climb in there? Not without my uncle knowing. I'm better at exploding than reassembling. But...  I could keep an eye on him while you look for that key. You read my mind. Another gift. No, I understand...  We'll talk later...  Okay. Bye, Grandma. What's going on? I don't think we'll be getting any help from Dad's family. They think we should just "let Mom's lawyer sort this out." They think she did it. Mom thinks that you believe that, too. I tried to tell her that wasn't true, but what I'm supposed to say? That the knife in our yard is over a hundred years old? That it could get worse? That someone in our family might have done something a long time ago that we're paying for now? Did you ask Dillon how he got his hands on it? Dillon had nothing to do with this...  So he comes in gives you a hug all's forgiven? That's not what happened...  What part am I missing? Look, you don't understand. Well, educate me. Please, I'd like to know. I think I know him a little better than you! Really? How much better? Oh, wait a minute. Did you... did you two... ? Yes. Okay. When did this happen? Last week. And I really don't want to talk about it with you. Wow. So you go all the way with the guy he disappears for three days. Good decision. He didn't "disappear," his parents sent him away. - Is that what he told you? - Yeah. 'Cause I heared he never left town. What? Who told you that? We'll see what he says to me. Luke, Where are you going? We have enough going on right now, Mom told me to...  What to babysit me? No. To keep you from doing something stupid. Maybe I should have done the same for you. I can take care of this and you'd be home by this evening. I'm not letting you mortgage your business, it's all you have...  Exactly. You have kids who need you. They're not kids anymore. They've had to grow up so fast. We were the same. Or at least you were. I remember the day you left for college. That was tough for me. You were the only classmate I hoped would stay in town. Why is that? You actually talked to me. Didn't think I smelled like "chemicals." Or make jokes about my clothes being covered with "dead people dust." Having you there made high school bearable. Almost. You could've left too, you know, Ray? I know. But I didn't. There were... expectations, to take over the business. Do you regret it? No. Granted, I don't make a lot of friends with the living, but...  I try to give something to those they've lost. Dignity. We're often robbed of it when we're alive. Please, let me help you. Hey, what's going on? - He "disappeared" again. - Who? Dillon, I went to the school and his house. Nobody's there. Luke, he's not gonna give you any answers. Leave it alone. Let me work on Springer. I will get answers out of him. I don't care what happened between him and my sister. What do you mean? What... what're you looking at? The trial that put Springer's father away. There were three of them involved, he's the only one who went to prison. I found an article in the school library today. What happened between Dillon and your sister? She has a blind spot when it comes to him because they...  They what? What're you talking about? I think you know what I'm talking about. Seriously? Yes. Olivia and Dillon? When? Last week. I guess. I don't know. It's weird, I mean, my sister did it before me. Well, she is four minutes older. C'mon, Luke, we can't have this discussion again today. I'm just... I'm not ready. And I'd like to wait till I'm out of high school. I thought you were okay with that. I am. I am. Hey. Hi. I don't think your dad can help you guys at this point. That's not why I'm here. I was actually looking for Caleb. He's kind of out of commission. May want to give him an hour or two to recover. From what? He had a, uh, "incident" in the embalming room. What did your uncle do to him now? Well, I don't think it was him. There are other angry residents at that house. I was with my uncle when it happened. And he was with your mom. Is she okay? Yeah. But she needs help, Olivia. And I think he may be able to give it to her. No, we're not taking any more "help" from Collins. He's a snake. I can't believe I'm saying this, but...  that snake may have some warm blood in his veins. He seems to really care about your mom, Olivia, like...  for real. I don't know who to trust anymore. Look, I'm not saying that you can trust him. I'm just saying, from my experience, if there's anything you can do to keep your mom by your side, you should do it. I'm sorry about what I did to that chicken. It was fine. No, it wasn't. It was dry. But your mom will be back soon and we can go back to eating food that's edible. Dad, who's covering this story for the paper, about Luke's mom? Don't know yet. But I can assure you, this time it'll be done fairly. What if the reporting's fair, but the verdict isn't? It's happened before, right? Has the paper ever reported on that? A miscarriage of justice? Where are you going with this, sweetheart? What I'm saying is, has there ever a time when you wished you'd taken a position and you didn't? Remy, it's a small paper in a small town. You have to pick your battles. There have been times when I would've liked to have said or done more, but I think I've made the right call more times than not. (knock on door) Olivia? I'm sorry I should have called first. Is your brother with you? Or has he already been here? No. He doesn't know I'm here. What can I do for you? I need you to help my mother. Who wrote this? You? Does it matter? All that's important is that it gets printed. And what do you think that's gonna do? Put that in The Gazette, make people in this town question if your father got a bum rap. Was the jury biased? Was the judge corrupt? Maybe it's not too late to change public opinion. Get him an early parole. Your father will never put this out there. My father is not above admitting when he's wrong. I think he wishes he'd printed that a long time ago. And you're willing to do this just to hear more about Dillon and that knife? You'd have to talk to someone with a badge, too. But I think it's a pretty fair trade. So... ? Print it. Okay. Hold on a second. Luke... ? Hey, Mr. Price. Surprised to see you here. You weren't in school today. Uh, no. I...  I've a lot of stuff going at home...  Yeah, I heard about your mom. Look, I know things seem bleak right now, but it's going to be okay. How do you know that? Got to have faith in the system. Whatever you're looking for, you might not find it here. Kids can be cruel, they may say something...  I don't care what they say. Just want to go watch the game, all right? Feeling any better? Little stiff. But that's to be expected. I was practically embalmed. Um, Caleb? What? There's something crawling on you. It's a huge spider. Where is it? It's on your arm, it's headed for your shoulder. Can you get it? What, no. I couldn't even get if I was still alive. Is it gone? Yeah. I don't miss those things. Or mosquitoes. This place is awesome. Yeah, told you. Not exactly a closet of demons. You never know what's hiding in the prayer books. This altar reminds me of a place I used to go to when I was little. It's my second foster family. They went to this sweet little church. They burned incense that smelled like nutmeg. Felt like Christmas all year long. Was the best part of my week. Are you gonna help me? Sorry. I was having a moment. Miranda... ? Look. Can you read that? Are these the names from Remy's dream? You mean the one where she saw them signing The Pact? She said there were six elders who signed. These must be their names. Why six? What do you mean? If there are five kids who are marked, then why would there be six? I don't know. But Matheson isn't even on here. My family name is the only one that is. What about Collins? It's not there. Remy's name isn't here either. Hey, what's Dillon's last name again? Isn't it Sanders? Remy? Dad, why're you sitting in the dark? Sit down. What were you thinking? Dad... Don't even bother. I know what you were thinking. You thought condemning this town for what happened to Zack Springer's father would somehow save Luke's mother. Springer's the one who can save Luke's mother. I did this so I could get him to talk. You did this without thinking it through. Why're you getting angry? Last night, you practically admitted that you felt the same way. All I was doing...  ... was putting words in my mouth. You're entitled to your opinions, not mine. You not only compromised my credibility, you threatened the integrity of the entire paper. Luke's mother is sleeping in a jail cell tonight! I had to find a way to help his family! At the expense of your own? Do you have any idea what your grandfather went through to buy this newspaper? To have a voice in this town? Do you have any idea how many years our family was invisible? What's the point of having a voice if you don't use it? You're not the publisher of this paper, Remy. In fact, as of right now, you no longer work there. Dad, this is about a lot more than Luke's mom...  What? What more is it about? That's what I thought. I don't understand. If Dillon's family signed it, too, wouldn't he be marked? Well, he probably is. But he wasn't in the car with us. Why would Springer be pointing the finger at him? Good question. And what does Dillon get by pinning this on your mom? What's up, Luke? What are you doing here? Where you have been last three days, man? What is this? Answer me. Look, man, I know you're hurting, your family is going through a lot of crap right now. How much of that crap are you responsible for, Dillon? What the hell are you doing? And what are you looking for? Why did Springer say you made him plant that knife? You let go of me. Answer the question. Let go of me! What is this? Huh? You can kick the crap out of me, Luke. Might make you feel better for a minute. But it won't change anything for you. What're you talking about, man? You can't hurt me. I'm not in this alone. I've got back-up. What does that mean? It means I found a way out! And you can too, before it's too late. Found a way out of what? The Pact, Luke. I made a deal when I could. I'm out of it. You made a deal with who? My advice? Offer up someone he really wants. He was happy to take your sister instead of me. Who was happy? Huh? Who was happy? Who is in there? Who is that? (gagging) Hey, this is Dillon. Leave a message, thanks. (banging) Luke? Luke... ? He isn't here. How did you get home? Mr. Collins dropped me off. Mom, I'm sorry... I didn't know what to do...  nobody else was willing to help...  There's nothing to be sorry about. You did the right thing. We're lucky to have him in our lives. So this is it, right? You're home? You get to stay here...  For now. But honey, this is just getting started. But we'll get through it, we'll do it together. Right now, I need to get out of these clothes and shower. Where's your brother? I don't know. He ran out. I tried to stop him, but he wouldn't listen to me. He is not answering his phone. Try Remy. Find him. I want him home. Okay. (door opens) Oh my God. What happened to you? Has he been here? Have you seen him? Who? What're you talking about? Did you get in a fight with Dillon? That's Mom. She's home. Mr. Collins posted her bail. Why would he do that? Because I asked him to. Oh yeah? And how're we gonna pay him back? Maybe you ought to ask your "boyfriend" about that. Ask him what? How he's going to pay Collins back. What're you talking about? Okay...  Dillon was supposed to be in that car that went over the bridge. How do you know about this? Are you talking to Caleb? I spoken to Dillon! Maybe you need to ask him why you were in that car and he wasn't. Luke, stop. Dillon may not even know if he's marked. He knows. He knew before we knew. He gave you up so he could save himself. - You're lying. - I'm not. That's crazy. Dillon cares about me...  I'm sure he does. I'm guessing that's what sealed the deal. It's got to cost him something. Luke... ? Is that you? Hey, Mom. Welcome home. Sync by wilson0804 Corrections by chamallow www.addic7ed.com
