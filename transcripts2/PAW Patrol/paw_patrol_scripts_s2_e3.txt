 ANNOUNCER: Time for another exciting adventure of Apollo the Super Pup! I love Apollo! He's the super-est pup ever! JAKE: Awesome! Chase, let's see what it looks like down here. (Barking) Light! Cool! You're right, Jake. This cave is cool and huge! Let's take the right fork. Awesome, right? Let's see how far down we can go. Careful, Jake. That's pretty steep. Hey, don't worry. I'll take it slow. Ah! Whoa! Whoa! (Grunting) (Grunting) Uh-oh. My foot's really stuck. Chase is on the case. (Growling) Ouch! Sorry, Jake. You okay? Yeah, I'm all right, but this foot ain't going nowhere. We need the PAW Patrol (Barking) (Beeping) Ryder, you there? Hello? Ryder? (Laughing) (Communicator ringing) Chase? Ryder? Chase, come in. Ryder? Chase? Chase? Must be too deep in the cave for your Pup Tag to work. Don't worry. I'll run up to the mouth of the cave and call Ryder. Don't move. Dude, I wish I could move. Oh, right. I'll be right back. (Barking) (Barking) (Howling) Here I come, here I come! Gotta catch me first. (Giggling and barking) Look out! Oof! Ah! (Laughing) Sorry, Ryder. I tagged you a little too hard. (Laughing) Guess I'm it. (Ringing and barking) CHASE: Ryder? Come in. Okay, I can hear you now, Chase. How's the cave exploring going? Not good. We need the PAW Patrol. What's wrong? We were pretty deep in the cave and Jake got his foot stuck. He says it hurts and I can't get him out. Don't worry, Chase! No job is too big, no pup is too small. We'll be right there. (Beeping) PAW Patrol, to the Lookout! (Beeping) ALL: Ryder needs us! But what about Apollo Super Dog? Come on, Apollo. ANNOUNCER: Will Apollo save the day his own way? (Barking) I can't watch, but I can't not watch. (Screeching) (Barking) Come on, pups. BOTH: We're... coming. (Inhaling deeply) (Exhaling) BOTH: Wow! ANNOUNCER: Once again, Apollo saves the day his own super way! Apollo's not even afraid of a super gigantic spider! I know! Apollo's so awesome! (Chuckling) Come on, Rubble. Let's go. Whoa! Oof! (Chuckling) Made it! (All laughing) (Bell ringing) Rubble, you forgot to take off your mask. No, I didn't. I'm on a mission! (Making fanfare sounds) Super Pup to the rescue! (All laughing) Wait, where's Chase? Actually... (Beeping) he's the one who called the PAW Patrol. Oh, no! Is he okay? He's fine, but Jake needs our help. Well, uh, PAW Patrol and Rubble Super Pup are ready for action, uh, Ryder, sir! (Laughing) Rubble... Jake and Chase were exploring the big cave. Jake got his foot stuck and needs our help to get out. (All gasping) (Beeping) Rubble, I need you and your jackhammer to get Jake's foot loose from the rocks where he's stuck. Rubble on the double! (Beeping) Marshall, I need you and your emergency response x-ray screen to look at Jake's ankle and see if it's injured. Ready for a ruff-ruff rescue! PAW Patrol is on a roll!

Come on, pups! I need to see if Jake's foot is okay. (Barking) Wait, Marshall! Make sure you go right at the fork. Marshall? Hey, uh, Chase? You didn't see any spiders in there, did you? Nah. Not any big ones, anyway. Come on. Chase is on the case! (Whimpering) Jake? Jake? (Voice echoing) Don't worry, Jake. I'm almost there. (Sniffing) Jake is down this way. (Sniffing) But Marshall went down that way. Okay, Rubble, follow the right fork and find Jake. See if you can get his foot free. Chase, you and I better get Marshall. (Barking) (Whimpering) Rubble, down here! Hang on, Jake. I'll get you free. Yikes! Oh, uh, hey, spider. (Chuckling nervously) Nice spider. JAKE: Everything okay, Rubble? Yeah. Just a big, scary spider. (Whimpering) It might be a little scary to Rubble, but to Super Rubble, it's just a sweet itsy-bitsy spider. Excuse me, spider. (Blowing) Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! Sweet move, Rubble! You mean Super Rubble, to the rescue on the super double. All right, Super Rubble! (Barking) Jackhammer! You did it! I'm unstuck! (Barking happily) (Laughing) Ouch! That smarts!

(Voice echoing) What if I took a wrong turn? What if I'm lost in a cave with a... Marshall! Whoa! Ryder! (Laughing) You weren't scared, were you? Being in a dark cave doesn't scare me... when you're here. (Laughing) Come on, pups. Jake needs us. (Howling) It's the PAW Patrol! To the rescue-- whoa, whoa, whoa! Oof! (Chuckling) I'm okay. Marshall, use your x-ray screen and get a look at Jake's foot. Make sure he didn't break anything. (Barking) X-ray screen! (Barking) Hmm... I don't see any broken bones. (Barking) I think you just sprained it, Jake. That's lucky. Marshall can wrap your foot, Jake. One bandage coming up. (Barking) JAKE: Nice! Can you stand on it? I don't know. Ow... Definitely not. Marshall? (Barking) Crutch! There you go. Oh! Thanks, Marshall. No problem! Okay, pups, let's help Jake out of this cave. Follow me! (Barking) (Howling) We did it! (All howling) Thanks, PAW Patrol. You totally saved the day again. Glad we could help. If you need anything while your ankle heals, just yelp for help. (Howling and barking) Uh, I could use one thing. What do you need? A ride home. No problem. Marshall's got that covered too. Ah! Let's go, go, go! Awesome! ♪ P-p-p-Paw, Paw, PAW Patrol ♪ Ah, nice and toasty. And my foot feels great too. Rubble was so brave. I was? I mean, of course I was! He sure was. Nothing could stop Super Rubble! It was nothing. Huh? S-s-spider! Uh, thanks, Ryder. No problem, Rubble. You're all a bunch of super pups. (Barking and howling) ♪ P-p-p-Paw, Paw, PAW Patrol ♪ SKYE: "Pups Save the Parade." (Barking and chuckling) Um... how are the Adventure Bay Day preparations coming, pups? Great! Check this out! Hose! (Barking) No, no, no, no, no! Don't get the floats wet. (Barking) (Laughing) That'll start the parade with a bang. (Laughing) Hey, Zuma, cool pirate boat float. (Laughing) Arr, shiver me timbers, dude. Check out my float, Chase. Green means go... to the parade. Awesome! Thanks, Chase. And the highlight of the parade... is in pieces? Sky, aren't you going to skywrite? It looks more like you're going to "sky-wrong." (Chuckling) Very funny. We're attaching containers to Skye's helicopter, so she can skywrite a big surprise. Will you be ready in time? Yup. Just have to put things back together. And this puppy's gonna fly! (Barking) (Growling) Rubble's having a little trouble with his decorations. (Growling) I'm trying to fill my bucket loader full of grey balloons to look like rocks, but look what happens! (Sighing) I really didn't think this through. (Laughing) Ooh, I love Adventure Bay Day, especially the blow-up pups. (Bell ringing) Oh, here comes Katie and her float. Hold these, please. (Laughing) Cool tub, Katie. Yes, very cute float. Thanks, Mayor Goodway. Those pink balloons look especially bubble bath bubbly. (Clucking) (Clucking) (Hissing) (Clucking) (Snickering) (Clucking) (Groaning) I'd never be ready without your help. Thanks, Alex. No problem, Katie. I love balloons, lots and lots of balloons. Huh? Maybe that's too many balloons. Ah! Oh, no! Callie! (Yowling) (Clucking) (Gasping) Oh, my precious purse chicken! Chickaletta! Come back! No! (Yowling and clucking) Callie! (Yowling) Look, the tub stopped! But Chickaletta doesn't drink lemonade. What should we do? I know! Call the PAW Patrol. Wait, I'll call the PAW Patrol. (Chuckling) (Communicator ringing, beeping) Happy Adventure Bay Day, Mayor Goodway. Not so happy Adventure Bay Day, you mean. We need help! What's wrong? Katie's bathtub float really did... float away, with my precious Chickaletta inside. And Callie too! It's stuck on the giant lemonade straw. You have to get Chickaletta down safely. And Callie too. Don't worry, Mayor. No job is too big, no pup is too small! Thanks, Ryder. (Beeping) PAW Patrol, to the Lookout! ALL: Ryder needs us! Just have one last balloon. Uh-oh! Whoa! (Barking) Wait, where's Marshall? Wait for me! (Laughing) How do I get down? Unzip your vest, silly. Whoa! Whoa! Watch your muzzle. Excuse me. Oh! (Laughing) (Sighing) I feel so deflated. (Laughing) Marshall... Marshall... (Bell ringing) PAW Patrol ready for action, Ryder, sir! (Beeping) Thanks for coming so fast, pups. Katie's parade float has floated away. Oh, I'd love a good scrub in a floating tub! With Callie and Chickaletta in it. The tub is caught on the lemonade stand's giant straw. We have to save the pets and get the tub down in time for the parade. (Beeping) Marshall, I need you to race to the lemonade stand and use your ladder to bring Callie and Chickaletta down safely. I'm fired up! (Beeping) Chase, I need you to use your megaphone and safety cones to keep an area clear for the tub to land. Chase is on the case! The rest of you need to finish decorating your floats. (Cheering) Rocky, can you help Skye finish getting her helicopter ready for the big performance? Or I won't be able to do my part in the parade! Don't worry, Skye. I'll make sure you can fly. Yay! Great! As soon as we save Callie and Chickaletta, we need to be ready to start the parade. PAW Patrol is on a roll!

See ya at the parade. (Beeping) RYDER: Skye! Right here, Ryder. Heading to the parade for my big skywriting performance. Sorry, that'll have to wait. I need you over here to get Marshall and Callie down from the float away bathtub float. Hurry! Let's take to the sky! Skye! Marshall! Boy, am I glad to see you. (Barking) SKYE: Grab on! Look, no paws. (Gasping) Yes! You're safe and right between my cones. (Howling) (Howling) Yes! Solid ground! Callie! I'm so glad you're safe. But the tub's still floating away! Chase, use your tennis ball cannon to pop some balloons. (Barking) Tennis ball cannon! (Chase barking) It's working! (Barking) Pardon me, folks. Hold on. (Panting) Watch out. Oh, no. Excuse me. Yes! Chase is... on the... case. Thank you so much, Ryder. And the PAW Patrol. Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help. I think we can finally begin the Adventure Bay Day parade!
