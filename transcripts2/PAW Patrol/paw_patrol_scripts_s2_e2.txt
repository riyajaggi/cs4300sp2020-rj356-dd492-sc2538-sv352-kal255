I'd help you down, but I don't know how, brown cow. But I know who to call! Where'd the spaceship go? It disappeared near Farmer Yumi's. (Phone ringing) Ryder here. Oh, Ryder, the most bizarre thing has just happened. You're not going to believe this. Whoa, that's weird, and kind of cool. can you help poor Bettina and find out what's going on here? We're on it, Mayor Goodway! No job is too big, no pup is too small. PAW Patrol, to the Lookout! ALL: Ryder needs us! (Yawning) Whoa! Look out! (Both grunting) Hey, who turned off the lights? And the stars and the moon? Hurry, Marshall! Coming! Hey! Who put a building right here? (Yawning) Made it! (Laughing) ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol, ready for-- (Yawning) Action, Ryder, Sir. Sorry to wake you pups. We were looking at the stars when something fell from the sky. It landed somewhere near Farmer Yumi's. What was it? It looked kind of like a spaceship. ALL: Ooh! Mayor Goodway showed us something really weird. Bettina in midair! A flying cow? "Utterly" preposterous. (All laughing) What's so funny? Yep. For this mission, I'll need... Chase, we can use your special spy skills and gear to help find the pilot of the spacecraft. Yes! Super Spy Chase is on the case! Excellent! Next I'll need... Rocky, you're my ace fix-it pup. You can fix whatever it is that fell from the sky. Green means glow! (All laughing) I still don't get it. All right.

Mayor? (Mooing) (All gasping) Weird. How does she stay up there? I don't know, but I think this might have something to do with it. Chase, use your zip-line suction cup to get Bettina down. Will do, Ryder, Sir! (Barking) Zip-line. RYDER: Perfect. Now, let's get her out of that bubble. Three, two, pull! Uh-oh! Run! Are you okay? Now I know what a pancake feels like. He's okay. Chase, I need you to use your spy gear to find the pilot of that spaceship. Yes, Sir, Ryder, Sir. (Barking) Night vision goggles. Let us know what you find. (Sniffing) CHASE: Strange tracks. I wonder what kind of weird creature made those. Chickaletta! Here, Chickaletta! You mustn't run away from Mommy. (Chattering) Oh, that doesn't sound right. My chicken-- (Imitating chicken) Not "meep, meep, meeps". (Clucking) Oh, there you are. (Vocalizing) Oh, dear. Oh, my! Oh, I can see my house from up here. (Chattering) The tracks go here and just stop. What happened to them? Chase! Yoo-hoo, Chase, up here! Mayor Goodway? Where are you? Up here! (Gasping) How did you get up there? A little green space alien beamed us up. A real space alien? I've got to see this. (Loudly clearing throat) Still floating in an alien light bubble up here. Oops. Sorry, Mayor. (Barking) Net! Ah! Ready, Mayor? One, two, three! (Grunting) Whoa! Nice catch, Chase. Thanks. Some kind of antenna came off here, that landing wheel's flat, and some small wings came off here. Do you have enough parts for all these repairs? I've got a whole truck full of stuff. Don't lose it, re-use it! All right, now which way did he go? He went thataway. (Barking) Night vision goggles! A round, green head! Oops, it's just a melon. Melon, melon, melon, space alien. Melon. (Gasping) Space alien! (Vocalizing) Sorry. I don't understand what you're saying. Whoa! Great idea to fix the landing gear with that bicycle wheel, Rocky. Thanks, Ryder. This hanger should make a pretty good antenna. Looks like we're done here. I'll go check on Chase. (Grunting) Help, help! Anybody? (Sighing) If I can pull Bettina and the mayor free, I can pull myself out too. (Barking) Zip-line! Gotcha! Yes! Whoo-hoo! That's better. Now, where did that space alien go? (Chattering) Oh! (Sniffing) Hey, Chase, how goes the search? Great! I found a melon that was actually an alien, and then he zapped me with this cool bubble thing, and I floated in the air like "Whoa!" Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where's the alien now? (Ringing) Hey, Skye. What's up? We've got a visitor in the Lookout. And I bet I know who it is. We're on our way. (Barking) (All gasping) (Vocalizing) The Lookout looks so much like a spaceship, he's trying to fly it home. Sorry, buddy, it just won't work. (Sighing) (Chattering sadly) Something else is bothering the poor little green guy. (Vocalizing) Aww, I think that's his mom. And I bet he's really missing her. Not for long. Rocky, how's it going? Are you close? I'm close, all right. Look. (Engines humming) (Exclaiming) He fixed it! (Exclaiming) Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp-- Or "beep, beep, beep"-- For help! Come on!

Well, he will be a champion after he wins the Frogapalooza contest today. The frog who jumps the farthest is the winner. I'm training Smiley to jump like this! Whoa! Oof! Hey, my lunch! I'm good. He already seems pretty good at jumping. (Gasping) Uh-oh! Follow that frog! (Barking) Tool Arm away. Looks secure, Rocky. Uh-oh! Uck! (Laughing) Marshall, maybe you can train Smiley somewhere else. Come on, Smiley. Let's go. Hey, he listened. For once. He's heading for the elevator. Smiley, stop! Whoa! I'm okay. (Ribbitting) Gotcha! Okay, that was just practice. Now I've got you! You're mine now! You can hop but you can't hide. Or maybe you can hide. Smiley, Smiley! Now I gotcha! Whoa! (Crashing) Tricked by my own treats. No, Smiley, not down the slide!

Don't worry, Rubble. No job is too big, no pup is too small. PAW Patrol to the Lookout. BOTH: Ryder needs us. Thanks for the lift, Rubble. Any time, Marshall. (Laughing) Ready for action, Ryder, Sir. Pups, we've got a high-flying problem: Marshall's frog flew off in Skye's helicopter. And I'm sure he doesn't have his flying license. And it's almost time for the frog jumping contest. (Laughing) Skye, I need you to use your wings to fly up to your helicopter. You'll have to get in and take control. (Gasping) Yippee! This pup's gotta fly! You'll have to do it before my-- I mean, Smiley's-- turn to jump. Chase, I need you to use your cones to make a safe route to the starting line. Use your megaphone and siren to keep cars and people away from the area. Chase is on the case. Need anyone else, Ryder? Like a spotted Dalmatian with a fire truck? Hmm. Let me see... Marshall. Yes! (Howling) I need you to get to the frog jumping contest. Hopefully Smiley will get there in time. I'm fired up. All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll! ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ (Barking) ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ Whoo, yeah! Yay! Whoa! ♪ ♪ Chase! ♪ Ruff! ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ (Siren wailing) ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Marshall! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol, PAW Patrol ♪ (Tires screeching) (Sirens wailing) Copter in sight, Ryder. Nice work, Skye. (Ribbitting) (Quacking) Watch it, guys! Huh? Where's my copter? Spotted Smiley headed toward the middle of the bridge. We're on it. Do you see them, Chase? Negative. Behind you! Whoa! It's okay, Chase. I got you. (Chuckling) It takes way more than that to scare me. I know, Chase. You can get down now. Huh? Oh, right. Wings. No, Smiley, no a loop-de-loop. Whoa! Wow, it took me years to learn how to do that. Hi, Alex. Hey, Mr. Porter. Hi, Marshall. Check this out! That's quite a jumper you've got, Alex. He might even come in second. BOTH: Ooh! This is Jumpy Jumper. He's going to come in first. Where's your frog? He's, uh, on the way, I hope. Mayor Goodway, Mayor Goodway! Can you tell me when Smiley's supposed to jump? Certainly, Marshall. Let's see... Oh, Smiley is the last jumper in the contest. Last? Yes! He can still make it. Who can still make it? My frog. He's flying over here in a helicopter. I see. Wait, what? Easy, Smiley. Whoa! Ryder, I'm in. RYDER: That's great, Skye. And just in time. (Cawing) Oh, no, I can't see! Go higher! Pull up! Stay back! Whoa! Whoo-hoo! She made it! (Chuckling) I knew she would. (Laughing) Oh, yeah, that's the spot. She cleared the lighthouse! Yeah, Skye! (Howling) Whoa! Our next contestant is Alex's frog Jumpy Jumper. (Cheering) Go Jumpy Jumper! Ryder, is Skye going to make it? Smiley's jumping next! Hang on, Marshall, let me check. Skye, Smiley jumps next. Roger that. Okay, Smiley, no more messing around. Heel. (Barking) That's better. We're heading to the field. Okay, we'll meet you there. Chase, let's roll. (Siren blaring) Let's go watch Smiley jump! (Howling) Easy, Smiley. We're almost there. No, I said easy. Heel. Sit. Stay. Ryder, he's out on the wing. I'm afraid he's going to jump too soon. Fly as low as you can, Skye. Chase, stay under the helicopter. He jumped! Nice work, Skye. Chase is on the case. (Barking) Megaphone! Stay clear! Emergency! Very important frog coming through! Smiley! (Snoring) I guess flying a helicopter really tires out a frog. The next jumper is Marshall's frog, Smiley. (Cheering) Go, Smiley! (Snoring) Come on, Smiley, you've got to jump! Wake up! It's time! Chase, megaphone! (Barking) Megaphone! Jump! Great jump! (Cheering) Ooh, that was a good one. The winner is Smiley! (Cheering) Smiley did it! Thanks, pups. Thanks, Ryder. Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp-- (Ribbitting) Or ribbit for help! (Laughing) Smiley, you won! You can stop jumping now. (Engine starting) (Siren blaring) Oh, no! Not again! Follow that frog! Isn't that cute? A driving frog. Wait, what?!
