 a trophy should shine. Well, enjoy it, Mr. Porter. After the Adventure Bay Talent Show tomorrow, that trophy might belong to someone else. Like maybe... Chickaletta. B'kaw! (Rhythmic cleaning sounds) Hey, pups, cool beat. Now let's add some drums. (All playing rhythm) Hey, great groove, pups! Whoa! Uh-oh! Well, Marshall, you sure know how to make an entrance. (All laughing) (All playing rhythm) (Laughing) (Phone ringing) Hi, Mayor Goodway. How can the PAW Patrol help? Prepare to perform! The talent show needs more acts. It would be nice if someone other than Mr. Porter's pie juggling act took home the trophy... for once. I don't know, pie juggling's pretty awesome, but we'll see what we can do. Pups, Mayor Goodway wants you all the do something in the talent show. We can rescue someone. (Laughing) You're all talented rescuers, but this is a chance for you to try something different. Uhh... like... we could play fetch! (Laughing) You guys sounded pretty good with the wikki-wikki-wikki-- scrub-scrub-scrub... Yeah! We could wash our trucks for the talent show. I think Ryder meant we could play music. Right. Even better! (Laughing) Great idea. Pups, wait here.

I knew I shouldn't have tried to sing along. Oh! Oops. Sorry, Chase! I'll get the drum back! (Phone ringing) Hi, Farmer Al. Hi, Ryder. I have a small problem. I was digging in the potato patch when I accidentally broke a hole in the water pipe. Okay, shut off your water and we'll be right over. (Sheep bleating) Marley says, "Hurry, I'm thirsty!" (Bleating) No job is too big, no pup is too small. PAW Patrol, to the lookout! (Beeping) ALL: Ryder needs us! Whoa! Oof! Uh-oh! (Barking) Whoa! (Barking) Oof! Guess you guys "beat" me again. (Beating drum) (Laughing) PAW Patrol, ready for action, Ryder, sir! Thanks for stopping your rehearsal to hurry over, pups. Farmer all has an emergency. The water main under his field burst and he needs help repairing it. Uh-oh... the talent show's starting soon. I know you're performing at the show, but we have to help our friends first. Rocky, I need you and your tools to fix that pipe. Green means go! Rubble, I need you and your jackhammer and your digger to clear out the old pipes. Rubble on the double! But Ryder, he's our lead singer. Don't worry, pups, we'll help Farmer Al as quick as we can, and then race over to the show. And if I'm late, there's another pup who could lead the band. Me? Okay... I won't let the PAW Patrol down. (Cheering and barking) All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll! ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Rocky! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ Rubble! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go! ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol, PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ ♪♪ ♪ (Barking) Thanks for coming, Ryder. Thanks, Rubble and Rocky. Look at this broken pipe. Rubble, we need to get it out of there. Rubble on the double! Shovel! A puppy with a shovel? Amazing! (Playing trombones) Julia and Julius are really good. Yeah, but we're going to be really good too! Not if Rubble doesn't get here soon we won't be! I hope he hurries. Great job, Rubble. Put that old pipe over there. (Playing accordion) B'kaw! Come on, Chicky... shake your tail feathers. The Chickaletta Polka! (Cheering and applause) Now we just need to put that pipe back together. Pincer! Fixed it. Good work, Rocky. Well, now I've seen everything. (Stomach grumbling) Mmm... Mr. Porter's pie juggling act is making me totally hungry. Me too! Maybe next year we should have a pie eating contest instead! (Cheering) Huh? Whoa... whoa! (Splattering) Aah! Yes! I knew those pies rocked! (Laughing) All right, everyone, let's hear it for Mr. Porter's three pie pileup. It's time for the PAW Patrol Band! Come on, pups, we're on! Hurry up, Rubble. Great job, guys. All set. Let's see how that works now. Whoa! Well, heh-heh, I needed a bath before the show. Thanks, PAW Patrol. Now my crops will get the water they need. Whenever you burst a pipe, just yelp for help. Gotta go! Let's go to the talent show. (Howling) Good luck, pups! (Whimpering) It's okay, Marshall. You don't have to sing if you don't want to. But I don't want to let the PAW Patrol Band down. (Barking) Yay, hurray!

Okay, Rubble, we're almost done. For the next part of the corn maze, you need to turn... that way. Woof! Woof! We should be plowing through the exit soon. Hey, Rubble, what do little corn cobs call their daddy? What? Pop-corn. (Laughing) I get it! (Laughing) BOTH: We did it! Yes! The maze is done. And it's amazing! (Laughing) And now we've got lots and lots of corn to roast. But first we have lots and lots of shucking to do. BOTH: Aw, shucks. Huh? (Laughing) Let's get shucking. Another piled of shucked corn, Farmer Al. Thanks, Pups. I never could've gotten everything ready without your help. You can go clean up and get ready. Clean up? Us? Why? We have more dirt and husks on us than Farmer Al's field! Come on, let's go. (Barking) (Popping) Easy, girl, it's just some corn popping. (Popping) I can't wait to have some of Farmer Al's grilled corn. I can't wait to race through the corn maze. And I can't wait to show Skye the dance moves I've been practicing for the hoedown. Well, howdy, partner! Partner? (Barking) (Laughing) You two look like a couple of corn dogs. (Laughing) Yeah, yeah, we know. Where's Skye? Practicing for the hoedown. Circle right... and left... and promenade! And back flip! Okay, I made the last move up. (Laughing) (Sizzling) Oh, smell that, Chickaletta? The only think Chickaletta likes better than corn is grilled corn and the only thing she likes better than grilled corn is a corn maze! And that's the most amazing corn maze yet! Thanks, Mayor Goodway. Now it's time to get grilling. (Popping) (Mooing) Whoa! Aah! Uh-oh! Oh, my! The hot coals spilled everywhere. Call the PAW Patrol. I'm on it! (Video game sounds, phone ringing) Hey, Farmer Al. We're getting ready to head over to the corn roast. I need the PAW Patrol, quick! What's wrong? Bettina knocked over the barbeque. Hot coals fell on the piles of corn, and they're starting to smoke and smolder. I need the PAW Patrol to help out before the corn roast turns into a bonfire! Don't worry, Farmer Al. No job is too big, no pup is too small. PAW Patrol, to the lookout! ALL: Ryder needs us! Uh-oh. Whoa! (Barking) Wait for me! Sorry! But-- huh? Whoa! Nice hat. Yeah, yeah, I know... (Laughing) PAW Patrol, ready for action, Ryder, sir! Thanks for hurrying over, pups. Farmer Al's barbeque fell and spilled its coals. We have to put them out before anything catches fire. Marshall, I need you and your water cannons to put out the hot coals. I'm fired up! Rubble, I need you to scoop up the dried husks and corn and move them away from the cookout area. Rubble on the double! The rest of you can head out to the corn roast. ALL: Yee-haw! All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll! ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ Heh-heh-heh!

The coals have scattered all over. We have to put 'em out before we can start the corn roast. Don't worry, Marshall's on it. Right! (Barking) Water cannon! (Popping) Huh? (Popping) Whoa! Hey, I like my popcorn on my mouth, not on my nose! Mm! That's better. Popcorn? We'd better take a closer look. Whoa! The coals under this pile of corn heated them so much, they're popping! That's not good. Marshall, let's cool 'em down. I'm on it! Arf-arf! Water spray! Great! (Howling) (Laughing) (Popping) Uh-oh! More popping corn! Arf-arf! (Popping) And more! (Barking) (Loud popping sound) Guys? Help? Whew! I'm up to my "ears" in corn! (Laughing) Guess that makes me "pup-corn"! Chickaletta, Chickaletta! Oh, Ryder, Chickaletta's lost in the popcorn field maze! You have to find her. It's all right, Mayor. We'll find Chickaletta. (Beeping) Chase here! Chase, Chickaletta's lost in the corn maze. I need your spy drone and heat vision goggles to see if you can spot her before she's buried in popcorn. Popcorn? You'll see when you get here. Chase is on the case! (Barking) This pile of popcorn is still smoldering? There must still be a hot coal in there. Clear the road! Thanks, Rubble! I never could've eaten my way through all that without a movie... or two! There it is! Arf-arf! Spray! (Sirens) So worried about Chickaletta. Whenever she eats too much popcorn, she gets gassy. Don't worry, Mayor, we'll find her. Chase? I'm on it! Drone! Deploy! Oh! Oh! Uh, find that chicken! Nothing but popcorn. Lots of popcorn. I see her! Oh, hurray! Uh-oh, the drone lost track of Chickaletta. Oh, no! You'd better go in and use your heat-vision goggles to try and find her, Chase. Chase is on the case! (Barking) Hmm. I wonder which pile. Ruff! Heat-vision goggles! Gotcha! I'm going in! (Howling) Found her! RYDER: Great work, Chase! (Clucking) Uh-oh... Achoo! And her feathers. Don't lose her, Chase. I won't. Come on, Chickaletta. Follow me! (Howling) Hang on, we'll be right out! Hooray! Chickaletta! Oh, you're saved! (Belch) Excuse you, Chickaletta! The rescue must've fluttered your tummy. Yes... well... (Laughing) Wait for Mama! Ryder, the corn roast is ruined. All the roasting corn popped, and filled the maze. Hmm... I've got it! Farmer Al, what do you think of having a corn maze and a popcorn festival? Oh, great idea! Okay, Rubble and use the shovel on his truck to collect all the popcorn piles and the rest of us will bag it. (Cheering) The popcorn is bagged and the maze is all cleared out again. And coals are all out. No more smoke. Thanks, pups! Thanks, Ryder! You're welcome, Farmer Al. Whenever your corn roast is popped, just yelp for help. (Barking) Can we finally dig into some popcorn? Dig in and eat it, I mean. Sure you can. You're all such good pups. Mm! Yummy! (Cheering and barking) ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol... ♪ (Laughing) (Laughing) ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ It's amazing how much corn kernels puff up when you make popcorn. (Belching) Excuse me! It's amazing how much Rubble puffs up when he eats popcorn! (Belching) (Laughing)
