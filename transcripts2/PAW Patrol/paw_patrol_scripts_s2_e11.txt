 Who's next? Go ahead, Marshall. Uh, you first, Rubble. (Barking) It's Rubble, flying on the double! Take a bounce, Marshall. (Gulping) Okay. Just not too high. (Laughing) How was that? ALL: Higher! Higher! SKYE: Go higher! Huh? Okay, I'll try. OTHERS: Higher! Higher! Higher! Higher! Higher! Higher! MARSHALL: Whoa...! (Thudding) That's enough flying for one day. I'll just hang around up here. Whoooa! (Thudding) You just need to work on your landing. That's the most important part of parachuting. Thanks. Hi, pups. Ready for some parachute practice? We've got our gear and we're ready to fly! Except, uh, me. What's wrong, Marshall? Um, I don't like flying. Especially when flying means falling. Ah, that's okay. You can stay and guard the Lookout. Really? Whoo, yeah! (Giggling) I'll be the best Lookout looker-outer you've ever had. (Laughing) Bye! When the pups are away, I'll pup-pup boogie all day! (Howling) (Purring) Aren't you the super cutest kitty? Rawrrr? Hmph! (Mewling) (Groaning) (Latch popping) Meow. (Mewling) (Meowing) Reowr! Now you just need a cute little bow-- (Meowing) Don't worry, Cali. I'll tie your ribbon when I'm done with-- (Gasping) Reow, rawr. The kitties? Where are they? Oh no! Where did they all go? (Mewling) Here, kitty-kitty-kitty! (Gasping) Hey, wait! The kitties got out and are heading all over Adventure Bay! I can't catch them all by myself, but I know who can help. (Game points pinging) ♪ Do the pup-pup boogie! ♪ Check out this tailspi-i-in! (Phone ringing) Ryder? It's Katie. Huh? (Game pad pinging) Whoa-oh-oh! (Crashing) Hi, Marshall. Oh. Hi Katie. (Chuckling) You okay? I'm fine. I'm great! Is Ryder around? I have an emergency. Ryder took the pups out to practice their pup-ichute skills. I'm looking after the Lookout. Oh. Okay. When will they be back? Not for a while, but don't worry. I can help. Thanks, Marshall. Some kittens got out of their carrier, and are running all over Adventure Bay! (Gasping) No job is too big, no pup is too small. Even if he's all by himself. (Giggling) PAW Patrol-- (Giggling) --to the Lookout! Woo-hoo! Oh, yeah. Okay. Arf, arf! I'm finally first on! Guess I'm last, too. Oh, well. ♪ ♪♪ (Elevator dinging) PAW Patrol, ready for action, Ryder, Sir! (Giggling) (Imitating Ryder:) Thanks for hurrying up, Marshall. You're welcome, Ryder. (Imitating Ryder:) Katie has an emergency only the PAW Patrol can handle. Oh no! Where did they all go? I need, uh, Marshall to bring your ladder and all the PAW Patrol tools to help, just in case.

Something must have spooked him. (Spitting) Marshall, look! (Meowing inside, log creaking) MARSHALL: Here, kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty! Now what? (Gasping) I'll be right back. I have the perfect tool for the job. I'll use Rubble's shovel. Watch! Arf, arf! Shovel! Here you go, Katie. (Meowing) Great. Just three more to go. (Meowing) The others must be around here somewhere. (Gasping) There's another kitten! I've got her! I got her. I got her! No, I got her. I've got her! I got her. (Crashing) (Muffled) I got me. (Meowing) (Giggling) That tickles! There. Hang on. I have the perfect tool. Let's make sure you don't run off while we round up your friends. Marshall is on the case! Arf, arf! Net! (Net whistling through air) Gotcha! Oops. Sorry about that, Katie.

Are you going to fly it all the way up there? Meow! I can do it. Arf! Arf! Wings. (Engine starting up) This pup's gotta fly! Whoa-- ooh! Oop! Eek! Wha! Careful, Marshall! MARSHALL: I'm flying!

You did it! Huh? You saved the kitties. (Meowing) (Giggling) Even the kitty thanks you. Well, whenever you're in trouble, just meow for help.

All the pup houses are clean. Well, not all of them. I guess Marshall didn't sweep his pup house. Where is Marshall? I just saw him a minute ago. Here I am! (All laughing) The frigid frost froze everything so stupendously solid, I don't need The Flounder to go fishing. I can just ice fish on Adventure Bay! (Line stretching) Woo-hoo-hoo! I fished a fantastically fresh finned flip-flopper right out of the frozen deep! Whoa! Ha-- hey-hey! Whoa-ho-ho! Hey, he-hey! Hey, that tickles! Ugh! (Crying out) (Grunting) (Sighing) Well, Wally, this has not been our most fortuitous fishing foray. Look! Some deer took a winter walk on the frozen bay, right out to Rock Island! Looks to me like they went to forage up some more food, but the branches are bare! Whoa. The ice is extra super-slippery slick over there. I think they're stuck. Come on, Wally. We gotta help them! Whoa-whoa wa-ho, whoa, noo! (Wally barking) Whoooa! (Knees chattering) (Chuckling) Thanks, Wally. Oh! What's going on? Ah! Whoa. We need some help for the deer, and us. Ah, I know who to call. Snowman's middle ready! Incoming! Right on target. I've got the arms right here. (Phone ringing) Cap'n Turbot? Oh, dear. The dear deer! Ohhh! Deer. Exactly. The ice is too slippy-slidey-slick and now they're stuck! When Wally and I tried to help them, I got, uh, heh-heh, stuck too. They need help! Don't worry, Cap'n Turbot. No job is too big, no pup is too small. (Beeping) PAW Patrol, to the Lookout! ALL: Ryder needs us! Oof. Whoa! Whoooa! Whoa, whoa, waaah-oooh! ALL: Look out! No way! (Crashing) Oof. Wow! It's like being in a snow globe! ALL: Wow. ♪ ♪♪ (Elevator dinging) PAW Patrol ready for action Ryder, Sir! (Beeping) Thanks for racing up in the cold, pups. We've got an emergency on Adventure Bay. Some deer were trying to cross the frozen bay to get food, but the ice is too slick and they can't get their footing. They're stuck. Cap'n Turbot tried to help but he got stuck too. Whooa! Help, help, help! We have to get them all on land before they get too cold, hungry and tired. Zuma, I need you to use your hovercraft and buoy to tow back one of the deer. Let's dive in! I need another vehicle that can handle all that ice, and I know just the pup. (Beeping) ALL: Everest! (Yipping) (Grunting) Sweet grab, Everest. (Collar beeping) Hi, Ryder. Everest, I need you and Jake to use your snowcat and patrol sled to help rescue some stranded deer. Ice or snow, I'm ready to go! Meet us out on the bay. BOTH: We're on it! All right!

ZUMA: They look so tired. I'll keep her busy with some carrots while you slip the buoy under her. Great idea! (Munching) (Whispering) Arf, arf! Buoy! Perfect, Zuma. Arf, arf! Sled! Perfect, Everest! Now we just have to get him on the sled. That's why you brought Jake. All right. Time for my works-every-time deer call. (Clearing throat) (Imitating dear call) Almost got him. Hmm. Maybe a baby deer call will work better. Check this out. (Imitating baby deer call) Yes! I think it's working! (Crying noises) Woo-hoo! Yes! Good work, you two. Yeah! Gimme some paw! Okay, you and Zuma get these two back to solid ground. I'll go get the captain. (Small bleating sound) Huh? Oh, no! (Bleating) That must be their baby deer! (Bleating) She's stuck up there. (Beeping) RYDER: Everest. Yes, Ryder? I need you and Jake back here as soon as you can. There's a baby deer stuck on the top of Rock Island. (Gasping) On our way! (Motor revving) (Beeping) Marshall, it's Ryder. Go ahead, Ryder. What do you need? I need your emergency vehicle down at the bay. There's a chilly baby deer who needs blankets, food, and a check-up. I'm ready for a ruff-ruff-rescue! Ruff! Ruff! (Giggling) Whoa-whoa-whoa! (Brakes screeching) She's up there. (Bleating) Can you climb up and bring her down in the sled? That's what a patrol dog's for! You called the right team. Hook on the rope. I'm goin' up. Woof! Woof! Grappling hook! Ruff! Grappling hook, retract! (Retractor whirring) Guess I get to do this the hard way. (Grunting) (Bleating) Easy there. We're here to help. Wait- where's Jake? (Ice pick crunching ice) Need a paw down there? (Grunting) (Panting) No, I'm good. (Grunting) Ah. Good and tired! (Bleating) Aww, she's so cold and scared. Let's get her home to Mom and Dad. All right, who wants to go for a sled ride? (Bleating) Yeaaaa-hoo! (Howling) (Bleating) (Munching) Mom's doing fine. A little more food, and she'll be ready to go. Ya-hoo! This little fawn is ready for a warm welcome. And I've got just the thing. (Chattering) That should help warm you up. (Sucking) (Happy bleating) (Bleating) Now that's where a little deer belongs. (Slurping) Ahh! I couldn't be more comfy with my cocoa and my... see, aha! Scrumptiously succulent squid jerky! There's plenty to share! Not even you, Wally? Arf! Mm, okay. More for me. (Straining) (Thudding) Oh! Mmm-mm! That's some marvellous munchies! Arf! I have a few non-squid snacks, because you've all been good pups. Awesome! Yeah! Woo-hoo!
