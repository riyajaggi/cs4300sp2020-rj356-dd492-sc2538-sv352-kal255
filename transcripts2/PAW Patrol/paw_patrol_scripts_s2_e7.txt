 (Horn honking) (Squawking) (Trumpeting) (Sniffing) Smell that? Smells like... (Sniffing) ... jungle! (Dogs barking happily) We're almost there, Carlos. I can't wait to see you! How are all the pups? (Pups cheering) Yay! We're great! They're pretty excited. (Brakes squealing) (Barking happily) Hey, Carlos. How's it going? Great! (Dogs barking and laughing) Hey, pups. (Laughing) That tickles. Wow, it's really cool here. What an amazing place to live. Yeah! The jungle here is full of awesome stuff. Like this green vine would make a great swing. Wait! Marshall, that's not a vine. It's... it's... What? (Hissing) A snake! Whoa! Ryder! (Chuckling) Don't worry, Marshall. He's a friendly snake. (Chuckling) (Monkey chattering) That sounds like Mandy. (Chattering) ALL: Hey, Mandy! There she is. (Chattering) (Chuckling) (Laughing) Hang on, Mandy. Let me get a picture. Hey! Give that back! (Chattering) (Chattering) (Barking) I need it. (Beeping, chattering) Come on, Mandy. (Laughing, chattering) (Dogs barking and howling) (Sighing) I can't believe she took off with my Pup Pad. This is a job for the PAW Patrol! No job is too big, no pup is too small! But I can't call the pups without my Pup Pad. (Barking) The PAW Patroller. Let's go! (Beeping) PAW Patrol, to the PAW Patroller! ALL: Ryder needs us! (Barking) Whoa! I'm good. Come on, Marshall! Hurry! (Grunting) (Barking) Whoa! Sorry I'm late. I got a little wrapped up in the jungle. (Laughing) (Laughing and barking) (Laughing and barking) (Howling and barking) PAW Patrol ready for action, Ryder, sir! (Barking) Thanks for helping me out, pups. (Beeping) You all know Mandy took my Pup Pad. The tracking device shows where Mandy is. Right now, it looks like she's heading out of the jungle and up into the hills. Uh-oh! That's where the ancient ruins are. They're cursed! Cool! Wait, are there spiders in there? (All laughing) (Beeping) RYDER: Skye, I need you to use your helicopter to try to find Mandy from the air. This puppy's got to fly. (Ringing) What? That's my Pup Pad calling. How can I be calling the PAW Patroller? (Laughing, chattering) RYDER: Mandy... (Chattering) Mandy, bring my Pup Pad back to the PAW Patroller. (Chuckling) Nice talking to you too. (All laughing) (Beeping) Chase, I need you and your Super Spy Infrared Goggles to track Mandy around the ruins. Ancient curses and ruins? Cool! Super Spy Chase is on the case. Carlos, what to come? Uh, I guess so, but I hope Mandy doesn't go inside the ruins. The legend says once you go in, you'll never get out. Awesome! Cool! Spooky. Spooky. I'm sure we'll be fine.

(Chattering) (Siren sounding) She should be around here somewhere. (Mandy chattering) (Chattering) (Chattering) There she goes! You guys wait here. I'll go after her. Wait up! We won't let you go in there alone. We won't? (Sighing) Okay, I guess we won't. (Laughing) ALL: Ooh... (Barking) Light! There she is! (Chattering) ...or was. Whoa, this place is so cool. It's called the Temple of the Monkey Queen. The legend says if you take the necklace off the statue, the temple will fall down... with you in it. Awesome! (Chattering) There she is. Chase, keep Mandy busy. I'll get the Pup Pad. Super Spy Chase is on the case. (Barking) Zip line. Ooh... Hey, Mandy, watch this monkey business. (Barking) Suction cups! Bet you can't do this, Mandy. (Chattering) (Barking) Reverse! Pretty cool, right? Wow! Amazing, Chase. (Chattering) Hey, you're pretty good on a zip line too, Mandy. Nice move, Chase. I got the Pup Pad. Great! Now, let's get out of here. Hold on. Just let me get some pictures. Come on, Ryder, before something bad happens. Okay. Come on, Mandy. Let's go. (Chattering) No! Mandy! She took the necklace! The ruins are going to fall down. Let's go! (Rumbling) Whoa! CARLOS: Run! Oh, no! They're trapped! (Straining) (Rumbling) It's the curse! We have to get the necklace back on the statue. (Beeping) Skye... (Straining) (Beeping) RYDER: Can you hear me? Loud and clear. But a big boulder fell and is blocking the door! I'm going to need help. (Beeping) Rubble, I need you with your jackhammer up at the ruins right away! I'm on my way, Ryder! (Barking) (Barking) Rubble on the double! That boulder's blocking the door. Ryder, Carlos and Chase are trapped inside! I'll have to use my jackhammer to break it up, then maybe they can get through. (Crashing) BOTH: Uh-oh... How are we going to get the necklace back up there? It's time for Super Spy Chase. (Barking) Night vision goggles! (Chattering) (Barking) Zip line! (Sighing) Missed her. (Barking) Light! She dropped the necklace. Now's our chance. (Grunting) Whoa! Careful. (Gasping) (Sighing) I'm good. There! I think it worked! We did it! (Howling) Now, let's get out of here. (Barking) Jackhammer. (Barking) Shovel. Ryder, Rubble cleared the boulders away from the door. See if it can slide open now. (Straining) It's too heavy. There must be some other way to open the door. (Chattering) (Chattering) (Barking happily) BOTH: You did it! RYDER: Yup, with a little help from our mischievous little monkey. ALL: Bye, Mandy! See ya! See ya! Thanks for getting us out, Pups. I knew all I'd have to do is yelp for help. (All laughing) (Gasping) (Giggling) (Chattering) Hey, my cell phone! Not again! Mandy! (Phone ringing) Hello. Ryder here. (Chattering) ALL: Mandy! (Chattering) (Chattering) I got it! (Grunting) Told you I got it. (Laughing) ANNOUNCER: Don't miss the annual Sheep Herder of the Year Competition! Last year's winner, Silvia the Super Shepherd is the favorite to win the blue ribbon again this year. Oh, I'm so excited you're competing for sheep header of the year, Chase! (Gulping) Silvia's herding looks pretty good. You're going to win for sure. You put the "herd" in "Shepherd. Oh! Get it? "Herd" in "Shepherd?" (Chuckling) If I'm going to win, I need to practice. You see, "Herd" is in the word "Shepherd." There must be something or someone who needs herding. See you at the competition! Whoa! Almost lost them there. (Gasping) They need some herding help! (Barking) Huh? Go left! No, go right! (Crashing) (Gasping) (Splatting) Sorry, Mr. Porter. (Chuckling) That's okay, Chase. You were trying to help. You did help! You herded the cake into my mouth! Mmm... Six laughing gulls... (Squawking) (Gulls cawing) Captain Turbot is counting seagulls. I'll help him by herding them closer. (Barking, birds cawing) Oh! Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve-- whoa! Sorry, Captain Turbot. I was just trying to herd the seagulls for you. (Chuckling, cawing) You got this gull to gather on my gourd. Oh, thirteen laughing gulls. (Cawing) (Whimpering) (Squeaking) Whoops! (Barking) Whoa! (Gasping) No! (Barking) Whoa! (Sighing) Sorry, Rocky. It's not your fault, Marshall. It's mine. I can't even herd tennis balls. Nobody can herd tennis balls, Chase. They're just tennis balls. (Sighing) I'll never win Shepherd of the Year Award. BOTH: Uh-oh... Ryder, Ryder! Chase needs help! He can't even herd tennis balls. It sounds like Chase has lost his confidence. (Phone ringing) (Beeping) Hi, Farmer Al. Howdy, Ryder. Afraid I'm in a bit of a pickle. What's wrong? My fence broke and the sheep I was taking to the herding competition ran away. Don't worry, Farmer Al. No job is too big, no pup is too small! (Beeping) This is perfect! Farmer Al needs help fixing his fence and herding his sheep, which is exactly what Chase needs to practice! (Beeping) PAW Patrol... (Beeping) ... to the Lookout! ALL: Ryder needs us! (Barking) (All barking) I got this! In line, single file. Hey, Chase, good pup herding. Yeah, totally! Whoa! Whoa-oh-whoa! I can't even herd the PAW Patrol. It's okay, Chase. You've got most of us. MARSHALL: Whoa! You must have "heard" I like skateboarding. (All laughing) (Bell ringing) PAW Patrol ready for action, Ryder, sir! (Beeping) Thanks for coming so quickly, pups. Farmer Al needs our help. His fence is busted and all the sheep ran away. He's going to need some expert herding help. Herding? Pick me! Pick me! (Beeping) Rocky-- What?! I'll need your tool arc to help repair the fence. Green means go! Hmm... let's see, who else? Pick me! Pick me! (Beeping) Chase-- Yes! I'll need your megaphone, net and excellent herding skills to help round up all the sheep. Chase is on the case! All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!

My sheep have scattered everywhere. See? Whoa! Whoops. (Chuckling) Better put this down. (Bleating) No "Baaa-ck talk" Marley. (Sighing) Okay, Chase, you get to Herding. Rocky and I will help Farmer Al with the fence. Chase is on the case! (Barking) (Barking) Perfect! (Barking, bleating) (Barking, bleating) This will be easy. We'll have this fence fixed in no time. Thanks, Ryder. Rocky... (Barking) Screwdriver. (Barking) Megaphone! (Barking) It's working! (Barking) (Bleating) Huh? A-ha! (Barking) (Bleating) (Barking) (Barking) (Bleating) (Barking) Nice work, Rocky. Thanks. It's getting late. We've got to finish this up and get to the herding competition. (Panting) I got four in the trailer. How many more sheep are out there? Five more to go, including Marley. Chase, there's one over by the barn. Can you go get it? Chase is on that sheep's case. (Phone ringing) (Beeping) Hi, Mayor Goodway. Hi, Ryder. Are you and chase on your way to the competition? Not yet. Farmer Al's sheep escaped and we're trying to herd them all. Farmer Al lost the sheep for the competition and doesn't know where to find them? (Gasping) Oh, that's bad, really "baaad!" (Bleating, barking) (Barking) (Bleating) That is one dizzy sheep. (Barking) (Barking) (Bleating) There are two more around here somewhere. A-ha! (Beeping) (Beeping) RYDER: There's two near the silo, Chase. (Barking) (Barking) (Bleating) (Barking) (Bleating) Uh-oh! (Barking) Net! Phew! Three down, two to go. (Barking) Now, Ryder! Great herding, Chase. Guess that just leaves Marley. Marley? (Bleating) (Bleating) (Barking) (Barking) (Barking) (Panting) Now, where'd he go? (Bleating) Whoa! (Growling) (Barking) (Clattering, animal noises sounding) (Clucking) How's it going, Chase? Having some trouble with Marley? Kind of. (Chuckling) Oh, he's a feisty one. I'm the only one who can herd him and it's tough at that. I'll get him, Chase. If I can't herd Marley, how am I ever going to win the competition? (Bleating) (Bleating) (Nickering) Let's get going to the herding competition. My old truck is so slow, we'll never make it on time. I know someone who has a really fast police truck. Huh? You can get us there fast, Chase. You got it, Ryder! (Barking) (Siren sounding) Yee-haw! ANNOUNCER: And Chase really has these sheep on the run. (Barking) The trick is herding Marley. If he can herd him, I know Chase can win. And a fine job herding by Chase. Just one sheep left and only a few seconds till his time is up. (Gulping) (Bleating) You can do it, Chase! (Barking) (Barking) (Cheering) (Barking) Chase wins! (Nickering) Yes, he did it! Yay! (Cheering) Woo-hoo, go, Chase! ROCKY: Way to go, Chase! (Barking) (All bleating) (Barking, bleating) Can I herd this time? Sure. (Bleating) (Barking) Whoa! ♪ You're all good pups ♪ ♪ And you saved the day ♪ You're all such "goood" pups. (Laughing)
