 BOTH: Watch it. RUBBLE: Wahoo! It really did freeze last night. (Laughing) Hey, what's going on? Whoa! (Crashing) Help? Marshall, how did you get in there? A better question is how do I get out? Stand back. (Barking) Shovel. Here comes Rubble on the double. Timber! "Brr..." is right. (Laughing) (All laughing) Sledding contest! (Laughing) Pups sure are having fun in this ice and snow. But I bet things are pretty slippery in Adventure Bay. I'll check through the periscope. (Beeping) (Vocalizing) (Chuckling) Whoa! This ice is as slippery as sliding through seaweed. Whoa! Thanks, Wally. Lovely! Look for the lofting lift! (Walrus barking) Whoa! (Chuckling) We're not quite ready for the Olympics, Wally. Oh, my, Chickaletta. It is slick out here. (Tires screeching) Whoa! Whoa! (Tires screeching, crashing) Really... slick. Oh, are you okay, Chickaletta? (Snoring) Everyone stay calm. Breathe! Breathe! (Inhaling deeply) Excellent, sweetums. (Snoring) Okay, Chickaletta, let's back ourselves out of here. Oh, no! We're stuck! We need the PAW Patrol. (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing, beeping) Hi, Mayor Goodway. Ryder, I slid into a snow bank and got stuck. Are you okay? Oh, we're fine, but this town's an icy mess. (Tires screeching) Whoa! (Crashing) I'm okay. The streets aren't safe. Leave it to the pups. No job is too big, no pup is too small. And Ryder, if it's not too much trouble, um... could you rescue us before poor Chickaletta completely freaks out?! No problem, Mayor. We're on our way. (Beeping) PAW Patrol, to the Lookout! ALL: Ryder needs us! (Howling) Wee! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, I made it first. Pretty cool, aren't I? (All laughing) (Elevator bell dinging) PAW Patrol ready for action, Ryder, sir! (Beeping) Thanks for racing up, pups. This ice has made Adventure Bay super slippery. (Humming, Wally barking) And the streets are very slick. MAYOR: Whoa, whoa! (Crashing) Mayor Goodway and Chickaletta are stuck in a snow bank and need our help. What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? (Beeping) Chase, I need you to use your traffic cones and megaphone to help direct cars on the icy roads. Chase is on the case! (Beeping) Rubble, I need you and your rig to help clear the snow off the roads. Rubble on the double! All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!

Rubble, you take the lead and clear a path. (Barking) Great job, Rubble! (Siren sounding) (Cheering) CHASE: Whoa! Whoa! Mayor Goodway, are you okay? We're fine, Ryder. Ooh, Chickaletta, we're being rescued! You've been so brave during this ordeal. (Snoring) Chase, traffic control. Chase is on the case! Whoa! Oof! More like Chase is on his face. (Chuckling) Let's use your winch to pull the mayor's car out. (Barking) Winch. Got it. Whoa! Whoa! Chase, start the winch motor! (Barking) Winch. Perfect! Great job, Chase. All clear, Mayor. Thank you, Ryder. Ooh, my Chickaletta. Are you okay? (Clucking) She's making snow angels. More like snow chickens! (All laughing) Chickaletta, you little artiste! Make room for Mommy! (Laughing) (Laughing) (Phone ringing) (Ringing, beeping) Hello. Ryder here. Ryder, we need help at the crossing. Some branches and snow are blocking the tracks. I won't be able to drive through it. Okay, we're on it and I know just the pup to lend a paw. (Beeping) Everest, PAW Patrol needs you. Ryder? How can I help? The train crossing is blocked with snow. We have to clear it fast. Meet us there. Ice or snow, I'm ready to go! (Barking) Snow plough! ♪ Everest ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol, PAW Patrol ♪ Thanks, Ryder. You're welcome. Okay, pups, let's get those train tracks cleared off. (Siren sounding) Hang on! I need to clear the way. I hope Everest is moving faster than we are. Yeah! Woo-hoo! (Siren sounding) Whoa, the engineer was right. We need to clear the tracks. (Phone beeping) Everest, you close? Hang on to your hats 'cause I will be in three, two, one! There you go, Ryder. The snow pile is clear. But not those branches. We'd better stop the train while we move them. (Beeping) Mr. Engineer, Ryder here. How do the tracks look? Bad. You need to stop the train. A big branch fell across the tracks. We have to clear it before you come into the station. Okay, Ryder, I'll hit the breaks. (Brakes screeching) Ryder, the track's too icy. The train isn't stopping. If he can't stop the train, he'll hit the branch and jump the tracks. Chase, we'll use your winch to drag the branches. Everest use your trail clearing arm to move the trunk. Rubble, your shovel can scrape the ice off the tracks so the train can stop. Let's go, pups. ALL: We're on it! (Barking) Winch hook. I'll hook this to the branches. (Barking) Clearing arm. All ready, Chase. (Barking) Winch. (Beeping) Great job, Everest. (Train whistle blowing) Here comes the train. Hurry, Rubble. Rubble on the double! (Train whistle blowing) It looks like it's working. (Beeping) Rubble, pull over. He should be able to stop now. Rubble getting off the track on the double. (Brakes screeching) The brakes are holding! Wahoo! The train's stopping where Rubble cleared the track. ALL: We did it! (Howling happily) (Brakes screeching) (Train whistle blowing) Thanks, Rubble! No problem! You got Adventure Bay moving again. What a bunch of good pups. The bay is frozen solid. Who wants to skate? Let's hit the ice! (Howling happily) I was born to slide! Yeah! Woo-hoo! (Laughing) Whee! Whoa! Watch out! (Barking) Whoa, whoa! Nice catch, Zuma. I know what we need. You've heard of a water slide. (Barking) Water cannon! (Chuckling) (Barking) Whoa! Cool ice slide. Whoa! BOTH: Uh-oh... (Cheering) What a bunch of good pups. (Laughing) Here it comes, Skye's super sky hook. (Barking) Nothing but hoop. Nice shot, Skye. Show us your stuff, Rocky. Here comes the Rocky spin and shoot. Yahoo! Yes! Oh, my! How about you, Marshall? Okay! Here comes the, uh... famous Dalmatian Dunk! Whoa! Look out! Whoa! (Grunting) Careful, you blundering beagle. Sorry, Mayor Humdinger. Oh, and I'm a Dalmatian. Sorry, we were just practicing basketball. Are you all right? Ah! Just a little bump on my foggy bottom. "Foggy bottom," because you're from Foggy Bottom. Nice one. Yes, well, if your pups need lessons, my undefeated Foggy Bottom basketball team would be happy to help. Ha! If your basketball team played our basketball team, they wouldn't be undefeated for long. (Laughing) Really? The Foggy Bottom Boomers are always game for a little game. Bring on your Boomers, Mayor. We'll see which town has the top team. Done! Done! Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Now, if you'll excuse me, my Boomers need to prepare for this laughable long shot. (Laughing manically) But, Mayor Goodway, aren't you forgetting something? Oh... keys, wallet, chicken... (Clucking) What could I be forgetting? That Adventure Bay doesn't have a basketball team. We don't? Well, that's just a disaster! We can't beat Foggy Bottom if we don't even have a basketball team. What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? Whenever there's an emergency, we call Ryder. Yes! Chickaletta, call Ryder. (Dialing) (Phone ringing) RYDER: Ryder here. Hey, Chickaletta. What's up? (Chickaletta clucking) Yes, I'll hold. Mayor Humdinger challenged Adventure Bay to a basketball game and we don't even have a team. Well then, we'd better get one. No job is too big, no pup is too small for basketball! (Clucking) (Beeping) PAW Patrol, to the Lookout! ALL: Ryder needs us! (Barking and laughing) Hey, guys, watch this trick. (Gasping) Ha! Missed me. (Laughing) Wait for me. ALL: Huh? (Elevator bell dinging) PAW Patrol reporting for duty-- Excuse me, coming through. --Ryder, sir. Thanks for coming so quickly, pups. We have-- We have a major hoopla on our hands, a basketball hoopla. Mayor Goodway needs a team to play basketball tomorrow against Foggy Bottom's team. Yes. Mayor Humdinger thinks his team can't be beat. We'll do our best, Mayor. That's all I ask. Although, winning wouldn't be bad either. We only have one day to get ready. (Beeping) Chase, I'll need you to use your whistle, megaphone and traffic cones to help run the practice. Chase is on the case. (Beeping) Marshall, I'll need your EMT gear standing by with water and ice to make sure no one gets overheated. I'm ready for a ruff ruff rescue! The rest of you pups, I need you to be the team. (Whistle blowing) We're wasting valuable time. PAW Patrol, you need to-- you, uh... Ryder, what happens now? (Laughing) PAW Patrol is on a roll!

(Clucking) (Laughing) (Siren sounding) (Tires squealing) (Siren sounding) (Siren continuing) Okay, team, let's see some hustle. (Grunting) (Grunting) Whoa! Whoa! A little too much hustle, Marshall. (Clucking) (Whistle blowing) Go, team! Keep those paws up, Zuma. (Barking) No! Sorry, Marshall. Alley-oop and alley-up, you pups. Let's go, go, go! I got it! It's mine! Oof! (Clucking) With plays like these it's going to be a great game! Okay, pups, take five. (Groaning) (Laughing) (Gasping) That's the team we're playing? Mayor Humdinger, meet the Adventure Bay All-stars. Your team may have won every game they have ever played-- Every game? But get on the bus, Mayor, we're taking your Boomers to school! (Chuckling) A team of pups! Ha! I hope the pups are ready, Ryder. All right, pups, let's shoot some hoops! (Cheering) (Gulping) Ryder, I don't think I should play in the game. But you practiced so hard. It's just, well, if someone gets hurt, I want to be ready. Are you sure that's the reason? Okay, you don't have to play if you don't want to, but if you change your mind, let us know. Hmm... (Growling) Okay, players, let's see super sportsmanship for this sporting spectacle. (Whistle blowing) Whoa! (Barking) Ha! Just let us know when you've had enough, Mayor Goodway. Don't count your chickens before they hatch, Mayor Humdinger. (Clucking) Oh, figure of speech, my dear. Drat it all! (Cheering and barking) All right! Yeah, bring it down! SKYE: Yeah! (Chuckling) Mine! Shoot! (Barking) I can't believe the pups are ahead. I mean, go All-stars! (Chuckling) You know what to do. (Barking) (Barking) (Whistle blowing) Foul on the Foggy Bottoms for forcing that flippity flop. (Whimpering) Oh, no! Marshall, Zuma and Rocky need emergency medical attention. Here I come, Ryder. (Barking) X-ray screen! No breaks. It's just sprained. Thanks, Marshall. (Barking) Bandage! Oh, that feels better, Marshall. Thanks. No problem, Rocky. Now, let's put some ice on your tail, Zuma, to keep the swelling down. Thanks... I guess. Marshall, you want to play? What? Me? We need you, otherwise we don't have enough players. Uh, Ryder, you know, I'm kind of clumsy with the ball. But we want you to play, Marshall. Yeah, it doesn't matter how good you are, you're a part of the team. No game is too big, no pup is too small. Marshall... ALL: Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Okay, I'll try. (Cheering) (Whistle blowing) I got it! (Gasping, sighing) You'll get it next time, Marshall. (Teeth chattering) (Teeth chattering) (Yipping) Oh, double drats! (Barking) (Groaning) (Clucking) (Laughing) Go Boomers! Marshall! Ah! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! (Gasping) (Buzzer sounding, whistle blowing) Look, I made a basket... with myself. (Barking and cheering) Great move, Marshall. You won the game! Yee-haw! What an effort! What a game! (Groaning) Lost to a pack of pups. (Groaning) What a team! If you ever need some all-stars, just yelp for help. (Laughing) You've all been very good pups and players.
