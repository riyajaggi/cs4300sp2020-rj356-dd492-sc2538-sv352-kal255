 We're all super excited! Fly safe! Will do. Over and out. (Engine sputtering) Hmm, that engine doesn't sound very happy. (Barking) (Laughing) Ace Sorensen is coming to perform her air show! Woo-hoo! We'll get to watch her do her amazing tricks in person this time. Trick flying is so awesome! Not to me. The only thing I like to fly are kites. See? (Wind whipping) Whoa! (Grunting) Sorry, Rocky. You okay? All good, Marshall. But your landing could use a little work. Yeah, guess it was a little rocky. Here comes Rubble, the pup to beat! But right on his tail is Ryder! (Phone ringing) Hello? Ryder, Ace Sorensen here. Hi, Ace. I can't wait to see your air show. About that: seems like my plane's having some engine trouble. Look. Whoa, how can we help? I'm going to try to make it to Adventure Bay. But it's getting dark. And I need a place to land. Don't worry, Ace. We're on it. No job is too big. No pup is too small. Thanks, Ryder. PAW Patrol: to the Lookout! Ryder needs us! Ryder needs us! (Barking) Ah, I'm stuck! Whoa! Look, I can fly! I can fly! I can fly! But I can't land! Whoa! (Barking) That's a rocky landing. (Laughing) ♪ ♪♪ (Dinging) PAW Patrol, ready for action, Ryder, sir. Thanks for racing up, pups. Ace Sorensen is in trouble. "Ace"? She needs to make an emergency landing in Adventure Bay. I've got to help. This puppy's got to fly! If, uhh, you need me to, Ryder. (Laughing) Of course, Skye. I need you to use your helicopter and night vision goggles to help Ace land in the big field at Farmer Yumi's. I'm ready! Chase, I need you to use your cones to set up a runway in Yumi's field. And use your light to guide Ace there. Chase is on the case. Rocky, once the plane lands, I'll need you to get to work helping Ace with repairs. Green means go! All right, PAW Patrol is on a roll! (Barking) ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ (Barking) ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ (Barking) ♪ Skye ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go, go ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go, go, go ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ Chase ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go, go, go, go ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol, PAW Patrol ♪ (Tires screeching) (Siren wailing) ♪ ♪♪ I don't see her plane, Ryder. Ace should be coming over the peak of Jake's Mountain just about now! There she is! Ace, we see you. Do you copy? Can't see, smoke in the cockpit. (Coughing) Whoa! Phew, you have to have a real eagle eye to fly around these trees. Whoa, a real eagle eye! Blech! Hey there, birdie. Here's your dinner back. Nice throw, Ace. The eagle caught the fish instead of me. No problem, Skye. We sure got lucky there. Whoa! But it looks like my luck is running out. Don't worry, Ace. Just follow Skye. Chase is going to set up a landing strip at Yumi's field. Come on, Ace, I'll take the lead. I'm on your tail. (Tires screeching) (Insects chirping) Perfect runway, Chase, but Skye will need to see where it is. I'm on it! (Barking) Floodlight! Great, but your light only shows Skye where we are. We need to light up the runway somehow. Rocky, do you have any old flashlights on your truck? Sure, I've got a bunch. Great idea, Ryder. Chase-- And Rocky-- Are on the case! Are on the case! (Barking) Tape. You should be near the farm, Skye. Look for the runway lights. Roger that. I see the lights, Ryder! Almost there, Ace! (Popping) Oh no, I'm not going to make it! The plane's going down too fast! I've got to jump! Oh no! Ryder, Ace has to parachute out. In the dark? She won't be able to see where she's landing. (Snapping fingers) I know! Ace, have you ever done any wing walking? Yep, it's my favorite stunt. Haven't you ever seen her walk and roll move? Ace is the greatest wing walker in the whole world. Aww, thanks, Skye. Awesome. Skye, drop your cable and harness from the helicopter. If Ace can get out on the wing and attach it to herself, she won't have to parachute. Roger, Ryder. You copy, Ace? Meet you on the wing! Here I come. (Engine popping) Careful. (Grunting) Missed it! I'm not sure I can grab it. I've got my parachute on! I'm going to jump! We can do this, Ace! I'm going to get as close as I can! Got it! I got her! (Barking) (Cheering) We're waiting for you at Yumi's farm. Almost there. Ryder, could you check on Amelia? Sure, but who's Amelia? My plane. Every great pilot names their plane. No problem. I can track Amelia from right here. Ace's plane is heading for a water landing. Chase, let's get to the Bay and try to get it onto the beach before it sinks. Chase is on the case! Marshall here. How can I help? We need you to do a medical check on Ace to make sure she's okay. On my way! PAW Patrol is on a roll! (Engines revving) (Helicopter approaching) There's Skye! Yeah! Woo-hoo! This is more fun than wing walking! Maybe I should add it to my show. (Grunting) Thanks, Skye! No problem, Ace! I can't believe I just rescued my hero! Ace, are you okay? (Siren wailing) EMT Marshall will answer that question. Let me check and make sure there aren't any broken bones. (Barking) X-ray screen! So, what hurts? Umm, nothing, really, I just got this teeny little scratch on my arm. Don't you think you overdid it just a little? Maybe. I feel like a Conehead. But otherwise, I'm okay. (Laughing) Come on, everyone. We need to get to the Main Street Beach. And fast, before Amelia sinks into the Bay! (Engine sputtering) Yes! All hooked up, Chase, let's get it to the beach before it sinks. I'm on it. (Whirring) (Cheering) Amelia's in pretty rough shape. I don't think she'll be ready in time for an air show tomorrow. That would take a whole team of mechanics. Team Ace reporting for duty. Let's get to it! Aww, thanks, pups. But you've helped me so much already. Whenever you need a paw, just yelp for help. (Laughing) Nice! Nice! (Barking) Wow, she's as good as the first day we flew together. Thanks, team. (Barking) It was our pleasure. I couldn't have done it without the PAW Patrol. I can't wait for the air show tomorrow. Skye, how would you like to see my walk and roll trick up close and personal? Would I? (Gasping) Look! It's Skye! Wow! She's so good! You're all good pups. Woo-hoo! (Cheering) Way to go, Skye! Way to go, Ace! ♪ PAW, PAW, PAW, PAW, PAW, PAW Patrol ♪ (Laughing) (Clucking) Such a good little messenger chicken! Wee! Woo-hoo! Chickaletta, Ryder's right there. Oh, hey, Chickaletta. It's okay, come on. Oh, don't be a shy little chicken. You can do it. Or not. Oh my, Chickaletta, did someone drop some corn? (Laughing) This is an invitation to Farmer Yumi and Al's wedding? All of Adventure Bay will be there. Could the PAW Patrol help set up? Of course we will. I love weddings. Woo-hoo! And decorating! Wee! And dressing up! And-- Flipping? Ooh, and a nice, warm bubble bath? "Bath"? I'll pass. Rocky, the wedding treats alone are worth getting wet. Marshall's right. But first, there are tables to be set and decorations to be hung. No buffet is too big. No pup is too small. Mmm, buffet! (Clucking) (Laughing) Totally on target, table-setting champ! Yes! (Mooing) How about my napkin cannon? (Barking) Awesome! Pink balloon, ready to go. Balloon bouquet finished. Wings! ♪ ♪♪ (Laughing) (Mooing) You look so pretty, Bettina. Here comes Rubble with his claw on the double! ♪ ♪♪ (Barking) Wow, Ryder, the barn's looking terrific! This'll be the fanciest wedding Adventure Bay has ever seen! Chickaletta, I can't see! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Huh? Whoa! (Squealing) Whoa! Whoa! (Laughing) You pups are going to look great for the wedding! What a pretty pup! I know. I can't wait till tomorrow. Weddings are so exciting! (Sighing) Rocky, you got to try this. No, thanks, I just took a bath last month. Rocky, you are kind of dusty. Nothing a little shake can't fix. (Sneezing) No! Help! Ha, knew you couldn't resist. (Sighing) Uh-oh, I really hope it doesn't storm for the big day. (Thundering) (Mooing) (Clucking) Oh no, the barn! What are we going to do? (Mooing) At least the animals are safe. We can't have a wedding in a broken barn. We won't have to. I know who can help. (Phone ringing) (Yawning) Ryder here. Ryder, sorry to wake you up. But we have an emergency. Oh no, looks like the wedding barn is blown to pieces. If we can't get it fixed up in time, the wedding is off. We'll be right there to help. No barn is too big. No pup is too small. PAW Patrol, to the Lookout! Ryder needs us. Ryder needs us. Whoa. Whoa! Whoa! Ah! Whoa! Whoa! (Crashing) Does this mean we just got married? (Snoring) What did I miss? (Laughing) ♪ ♪♪ Rubble? Rubble? (Snoring) Whoa! I'm up! I'm up! (Laughing) PAW Patrol, ready for action, Ryder, sir! Sorry for waking you up so early, pups. I just got a call from Farmer Al and Farmer Yumi. The wind wrecked the wedding decorations and part of the barn. (Gasping) Oh no! Is the wedding ruined? Maybe not. It's a big job. But I think we can fix it. Rubble, I need your crane to lift and carry wood to repair the barn. Rubble on the double! Rocky, I'll need you and your tool arm to reattach the shingles and the side of the barn. Don't lose it! Reuse it! Great. We have a lot to do in a short amount of time. So, I'll need all paws on deck for a good, old-fashioned barn-raising. Yee-haw! Yee-haw! All right, PAW Patrol is on a roll!

(Barking) (Beeping) How am I going to get up there? I'll give you a lift, buddy. Whoa! (Barking) Screwdriver. (Barking) ♪ ♪♪ That's all the shingles rounded up. (Squealing) Huh? Aww, look how cute Emma and Corny are together. Okay, everybody, ready to lift that wall? Yeah! Yes! Hit it, Rubble. (Barking) Here we go! Whoa! MARSHALL: Umm, help. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Marshall? I kind of got caught when the wall went up. Silly pup! Jump? Wee! Thanks, Ryder. (Barking) Hammer. (Horn honking) The food's here! Let's hustle! (Barking) Done. Done. Great job. But we're not done yet. Every barn needs a weather vane. The barn is back up. (Cheering) And so are the decorations. Great job, pups. The PAW Patrol saved the wedding. Thank you so much. I couldn't have done it without the pups. So beautiful! But where's the other pair of lovebirds? Other pair? Other pair? (Squealing) Oh, there's the happy couple. Emma and Corny getting married too? They're the perfect piggy pair. Al and Yumi, Corny and Emma, I now declare you husband and wife and pig and pig. You may kiss the brides. (Squealing) It's so beautiful. Aww! Aww!
