 (Whining) Little Hootie? (Laughing) Phew. I mean, I knew that wasn't a ghost. (Air whooshing) But that's a ghost! (Hooting) (Howling) I made it! My turn, my turn, my turn! Oof! Oof! (Gasping) Don't worry, I'm good. Well, not good at jumping, but you know what I mean. (Laughing) Now it's my turn. Whoa! Rocky? Where'd he go? Uh, Rubble, did you dig a hole in the middle of the yard? I didn't dig that. I fell in a hole last night too when I heard the... Uh... Well, uh... Heard the what? Oh, nothing. Just Little Hootie I guess. Hey, pups, how's it going? Not so great, Ryder. Someone's been digging holes and leaving toys all over. Hmm. Maybe some wild animal was prowling around last night. Or some wild ghost! Ghost?! ALL: No way! Spooky. It's definitely a mystery. Well, I saw something last night and it looked pretty ghosty to me. (Snoring) Ah! (Music playing) Whoa! Sounds like "Pup-Pup Boogie"? In the middle of the night? Okay, you-you-- Pup-Pup Boogie-monster. Come out! Huh? Ah! Ghost! It's okay, Rubble. It's just me. Yeah, sorry. But I did just see a white thing floating outside, and heard someone playing "Pup-Pup Boogie". Maybe someone forgot to turn off the game? That bag of puppy treats wasn't out here when I went to bed. It's definitely a ghost. We'll figure it out, Rubble. No job is too big, no pup is too small. PAW Patrol, to the Lookout! (All yawning) ALL: Ryder needs us. Hey, who left all the toys out? (Barking) Whoa! Rocky, shush. (Giggling) Whoa! (Crashing) (Laughing) I said shush. (Laughing) PAW Patrol ready for action, Ryder, sir. Sorry to wake you pups, but strange things are happening at the Lookout. Someone's digging holes, dropping toys, playing games late at night, and swiping treats. (All gasping) Treats?! No way! Who would do that?! Not the cookies! Rubble thinks it might be a ghost, so we need to set up a trap to figure it out. I need Super Spy Chase's night vision goggles to find out what's really going on. Spy Chase is on the case. I also need Rocky and his tool arm to help build the trap. Green means go! (Yawning) The rest of you sleepy pups can go back to bed. All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll! (Barking) ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ (Barking) ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ (Barking) ♪ ♪ ♪ Chase! ♪ Ruff! ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ (Siren wailing) ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Rocky! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol, PAW Patrol ♪ (Tires screeching) (Sirens wailing) Okay, Chase, find a good hiding spot to keep an eye on the backyard. You got it, Ryder. Super Spy Chase is on the case. Hiya, Chase. Good hiding spot. Huh? Why do I always forget the tail? (Sighing) Come on, Rocky. Let's build that trap. The cookie goes here, and if anyone tries to take it, this bell will ring and the air nozzle will blow the sheet on to the intruder, catching it. Unless it's a ghost. Ghosts don't usually eat dog treats. You're right, unless it's a dog ghost. (Laughing) Hey, Chase, how's everything? In position, Ryder. Standby. Ruff! Night vision goggles. All clear. Great job, Spy Chase. I'll check on the other pups. Over and out, Ryder, sir. Ruff! Suction cups. An intruder following Ryder. Chase is on the case! Ruff! Ruff! Zip line! Whoa! Ah! I caught the ghost! What? A ghost?! Ah! A ghost? Really? Pups! No, it's me, Ryder. Oh, no, the ghost got Ryder. No, Rubble, the ghost didn't get me, the trap did. Sorry, Ryder, I saw something following you. That was me. That's okay. You were both trying to help. (Laughing) Guess we should keep looking? Yeah. Hear that? It's the Pup-Pup Boogie-monster! I'd better check this out. (Whimpering) (Music playing) Hmm. RUBBLE: It was a ghost. It is kind of a mystery. I need all paws on deck. Skye, Zuma, Marshall, meet me in the backyard. (Yawning) Sorry to wake you up again, pups, but I need you all-- Hey, where's Marshall? Did the ghost get him? (All gasping) He's probably still asleep. Let's check his pup house. Ryder, look! The ghost? (Gasping) (Snoring) That's not a ghost, it's Marshall! Hello? Earth to Marshall! Where are you going? RYDER: Pups, it looks like Marshall's sleepwalking. And snow he's sleep-skateboarding! That's not good. Chase, let's go! He can't skate that well when he's awake. (Laughing) (Snoring) Marshall, it's Ryder. Wake up! Chase! Your zip line! Great idea! Ruff! Zip line! Got him! (Snoring) Lost him. Zuma, I need you down at the docks! No worries, I'm right here. (Snoring) Whoa! Awesome move! (Snoring) Uh-oh! (Cawing) Huh? (Yawning) I was having this silly dream that I was... (Gasping) Surfing on a whale! Whoa! Help! Uh-oh. Hang tight, dude. (Barking) Buoy! Don't worry, Marshall. You're safe, sound and awake. Uh, all right. Thanks, Zuma! Whoa! Oof! I'm good! Ryder? Chase? What's up? We figured out who the Pup-Pup Boogie monster is. Who? You! You've been sleepwalking. Sleepwalking? No wonder my legs are so tired in the morning! Don't worry, Marshall, even when a PAW Patrol pup is in trouble, they just have to yelp-- BOTH: Or snore. (Laughing) For help. Okay, all you good pups, time to go to bed, and stay there! (Air whooshing) Did Rubble find more ghosts? There is a ghost. Or a Rubble caught in the ghost trap. I found the double liver chip cookies! Yummy! (Laughing) Fear not, fair princess, pups of the round table will save thee. Uh-oh. Whoa! (Laughing) But who will rescue Marshall from under the throne? Marshall! (Laughing) This is a job for King Arthur! You are free, good-- (Coughing) Um, knight. King Arthur and the Pups of the Round Table will be the best play Adventure Bay has ever seen! (Cheering) It'll be knight-tastic! (Laughing) Yoo-hoo! Captain Turbot! How is my set coming? Castle construction is close to complete completion. Just one last nail. Oh! (Gasping) Oh, dear! Are you okay? It's a madcap Medieval mess in here, and I'm stuck. Oh, no! We need the PAW Patrol. (Ringing) Hi, Mayor Goodway. Ryder, crisis at the castle. The set collapsed around Captain Turbot. Uh, hi, Ryder. Don't worry, Mayor Goodway. No job is too big, no pup is too small. Bye, Ryder. PAW Patrol, to the Lookout! ALL: Ryder needs us! (Barking) I'm coming! Oh, no, not again. Whoa! Whoa! Well, at least I can see now. (Laughing) PAW Patrol ready for-- (Coughing) For duty, Ryder, sir. Thanks for coming so fast, pups. The castles that Captain Turbot was building fell down, and he's trapped underneath. Help, help, help! Chase, I need you and your winch, rope and hook to move the wall pieces. Your good knight Chase be-ist on the case, my liege. (Laughing) That means, Chase is-- (Clearing throat) Is on the case. Are you feeling okay? Sure! Never better! (Coughing) Rubble, I need you to use your crane and claw to lift the broken set pieces. Rubble on the double! Marshall, I need you and your x-ray screen to check Captain Turbot and make sure he isn't hurt. I'm ready for a ruff-ruff rescue! All right! PAW Patrol is on a roll!

We'll have you out in no time, captain. Rubble, use your claw hook to lift the wall. On the double. (Cheering) Rubble! Thanks for getting me out of there. Well, almost. It seems I'm still stuck under this silly scenery. Hmm. Chase, your winch! On it, sire, sire. (Siren wailing) (Barking) Winch! Go ahead, Chase. (Barking) (Cheering) Oh, thanks for freeing me from-- Whoa! Okay, Captain, I need to do a medical exam. Huh? (Barking) X-ray screen. Hmm, looks like it's only a sprain. I'll wrap it up. (Barking) Try not to use your wrist for a couple of days. Oh, I can't rest. I have to rapidly rebuild the rampart and quickly construct the castle. Don't worry, Captain, the PAW Patrol will help. Yeah, the show must-- (Coughing) Must-eth go on so I can go on. That's why you're the star, Chase, you're such a take-charge pup. Too true. Yep, that's our Chase. Okay, let's put this castle back together. (Barking) Megaphone! Okay, my knights of the-- (Coughing) Of the pup table, move it! ♪ (Barking) ♪ ♪ Hey! Guys? ♪ ♪ Oh, thank you, brave knights, for restoring the castle. Now the play can start on time. (Howling) (Coughing) Are you okay, Chase? You sound a little hoarse. No, I'm just a little pup. (Laughing) Are you getting a puppy cold? Marshall, can you take a look? Wow! Two patients in one day! Uh-oh! You've got a fever. Cough for me. (Coughing) Chase, you have a cold and you're losing your voice. No play for you, pal. But-but-- You need lots of rest and liquids. But, but, but, but-- Oh, my stars! I mean, my star-- Of the show! How can we put on a play starring King Arthur with no Arthur? Maybe one of the pups could fill in for Chase. But, but, but-- Wonderful idea! Uh, Marshall! Wha-a-a... You can save the show for everyone. But, but, but-- You know all the words, and you're the only other pup that the crown fits. But, but, but I only know how to be a knight! (Clucking) Chase said you helped him learn all his lines. Come on, Marshall, you can do it! Yeah, for me! (Coughing) Chase, you'd better get home to rest. Katie can take care of you. But, but-- (Sighing) (Coughing) Can't even watch the play. Don't worry, Chase, Ryder has a plan. (Applauding) Welcome to the show! (Beeping) Hey, Chase! Ryder? We thought you'd like to watch the play. Check it out. Without further ado, I present King Arthur and the Pups of the Round Table. (Clucking) (Laughing) Once upon a time, there lived a brave group of knights. I'm Sir Scoops-a-lot. (Barking) (Laughing) I'm Sir Dive-a-lot! (Barking) I'm Sir Scratch-a-lot. (Barking) Oh, yeah, that's the spot. I'm Lady Fly-a-lot. (Cheering) The Knights' mighty leader was the bravest knight in the land. The bravest knight in the land! (Applauding) Huh? (Cheering) Ah! (Gasping) Marshall, what's wrong? I can't do it. I can't remember a single word with everyone staring at me like that. Don't worry, I'll help you get started. Okay. Whoa! (Cheering) Uh... And I'm Arthur! And I'm an otter! Oh, no. I mean, I'm Arthur! Behold, the princess's throne, tis empty! Behold, the princess's phone needs ice tea. CROWD: Huh? I mean, is empty! (Clucking) Is empty! (Laughing) Who will rescue the fair princess? (Meowing) You can do it! Fear not, fair princess, Arthur and his brave pups of the round table will saveth thee! (Cheering) Bravo, Marshall! Bravo! Bravo! (Coughing) Behold, the bone! Mm! Looks delicious. Whoever pulls it from the stone becomes king. (Meowing) Hark the princess! Fear not, fair princess! (Laughing) (Gasping) (Grunting) Whoa! (Meowing) Huh? (Meowing) You are free, fair princess! (Cheering) Whoo-hoo! Great job, Marshall! Great job, all of you! You're such good pups. Heads up! All hail King Arthur! Hail King Arthur! Yay! Cali's okay! Marshall did it! (Howling) (Coughing) Back to bed, brave Sir Chase. But, but-- Oh...
