 Hmm, that's strange. This bait bucket is bare. (Whimpering) Now, don't be a wailing, worried walrus. Just got a fresh shipment of flash-frozen fish. Hmm. Sorry, Wally. This crate's clear out of cod. Nothing but ice cubes. Ah-- I'll share my sandwich with you. (Wally barking) It's tasty tuna. Ah! Where did my lunch bag go? What happened to the tuna treat? Whoa-- whoa, whoa, whoa! Wah! (Barking) (Sputtering) Thanks, Wally, but I'll pass. I just flip for flips. (Laughing) Whee, I'm on a swing! Yay! Superspy Chase is on the case. When you least expect him... Ah! ...expect him. Sorry, Marshall. I kind of slipped. That's okay. The more the swingier. Oof! (Laughing) (Ringing) Ryder here. Hi, Ryder. Something stinks on the Flounder and it's not fish. (Laughing) What's wrong, Cap'n Turbot? Some sinister sneak is swiping the seafood. Can you help us find the fish-filching fellow? We'll try our best. No job is too big, no pup is too small. PAW Patrol to the lookout! (Beeping) Ryder needs us. Whoa! Oof! Incoming! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I love group wipeouts! (Laughing) ♪ ♪ Ready for action, Ryder, sir. (Beeping) Thanks for racing over, pups. Something mysterious is happening on Cap'n Turbot's boat. A crate full of frozen fish vanished from the Flounder. The bait bucket was empty and even Cap'n Turbot's tuna sandwich disappeared. Help, help, help, help! (Laughing) That sure sounds fishy. (Laughing) RYDER: Exactly. We have to find out who it is and stop them. Chase, I need your detective skills and your superspy gear to help solve the mystery. Yes, yes, yes! Who gets the bad guys? Chase, the superspy. (Laughs) We may have to check in the water, too. Zuma, I need your hovercraft and scuba gear. Let's dive in! All right!

(Sirens wailing) ♪ (Sirens wailing) Chase, you'll have to hop on my ATV to get to Turbot's boat. CHASE: Yes, sir! Ruff, ruff! Eject! Whoa! Superspy Chase is on the case. Aroo! ♪ Hi, Ryder. Hi, Zuma. Where's Chase? He was just with us. CHASE: When you least expect him... Ah! ...expect him! (Laughing) Ha-ha... So, how can we snare the seafood-snatching suspects? We'll use these fish-flavoured pup treats as bait. (Barking) Cool trick, Wally, but we need these treats to catch the thief. Huh? Wait, there were five pup treats here and now there's only four. Somebody took one right from under our noses. Chase, can you pick up the scent? I'll super-sniff them out. What's the smell, dude? Fish, fish and-- ugh, more fish. And something I've never smelled before. ♪ Heights can't stop this superspy. Ruff, ruff! Wallwalkers! ♪ (Seagull screeching) Achoo! Hey, I'm trying to spy around here. RYDER: Keep looking up there, Chase. Zuma and I will check down below. ♪ ♪ (Snoring) It's really getting dark. I'll track them with my night-vision goggles. Ruff! (Sniffing) A-ha! Footprints leading to the hatch door. ♪ Thought you could hide from me, huh? Gotcha! What did you find, Chase? I got the-- rubber ducky? (Laughing) Hooray! You found Driftwood Ducky! Ha-ha! I wondered what happened to my little quacker. Thanks, Chase. Great work! (Ducky squeaking) Chase, let's set a trap. We'll put fish treats on the deck to lure the thief out. Spy Chase is on the case. Ruff, ruff!! Ruff! Zipline. ♪ Gotcha! Oof! Oh... (Chirrupping) There's more than one? Ruff, ruff!! Ryder, our slippery suspects are penguins! Penguins? CHASE: Yes. I almost had them but they got away. I need pictures of these precious penguins. Who will believe they floated all the way up here? Let's spread out and search. ♪ Found one! Huh? (Laughing) Whoa, a perfect penguin picture. (Sighing) (Barking) ♪ Over there! Where? Darn, missed again. Now where could those precocious penguins be? It's a proverbial penguin posse! CHASE: Gotcha. Sorry, Cap'n. We have to get those birds back to their cold homes. (Barking) Sorry, Wally. We're all out of fish. And ideas. (Barking) Huh? CAP'N TURBOT: Aie-aie-aie! An iceberg! The penguins must have ridden the iceberg up here. Maybe they could ride it home if we can get them on it. We can't lure them. We're all out of fish. What else do penguins eat? The usual-- fish, fish, krill, fish, more fish, squid. Oh, that's it-- my squid jerky! I was saving this squid jerky for Wally's stocking stuffer. (Sniffing) Gross. Those pesky pilfering penguins won't be able to resist my scrumptious squid. Ahh! That stuff stinks! Yes, it does. Maybe just a little nibble. Oh! Hey, Zuma, can you take this over to the iceberg? Sure thing. (Barking) Buoy! Whoo, pee-yew. ♪ ZUMA: Chow time, little penguin dudes. ♪ (Laughing) Aw, they're so happy on that iceberg. It won't stay icy. They need to get back to colder water ASAP. Hmm. I've got it! Cap'n, let's check your lighthouse log for any ships headed south. Great idea, Ryder. Fantastic! A frozen-fish-carrying frigate is headed to the farthest tip of South America. Time to move an iceberg. (Ship's horn blasting) They're so cute! I want to slide like a penguin. Just hop up and ride on your belly. Whee! Me too, me too, me too! Whoa! ♪ You're all good pups ♪ ♪ And we saved the day ♪ Say cheese. RUBBLE: Who's the best sand sculptor in adventure bay? Me, that's who. I got it! No, I got it! ♪ (Giggling) More like it got you. (Laughing) That darling dolphin family should be near, Wally. I can't wait to see how their perfectly precious newborn pup is doing. (Dolphin clicking) (Barking) I don't see the dolphin pup either, Wally. Leaping lionfish! There's that dynamic little dolphin, playing on the beach! Wait, that dolphin pup can fly! (Laughing) Oh! It's just a blowup toy. (Barking) Ah! Wally, don't fidget a flipper. He's right next to you. (Dolphin clicking) That's a perfectly pleasant and particularly perky little pup. (Ducks quacking) Uh-oh, the dolphin pup's heading upriver. That's no good. That river's too shallow for dolphins. We need to get the pup out before it gets stuck. (Ringing) Hi, Cap'n Turbot. Hi, dolphin. The baby Ryder swam upriver. I mean, hi, Ryder. The baby dolphin swam upriver! A new baby dolphin? Yes. It could get trapped in the rocks or shallow water. Don't worry, Cap'n. No job is too big, no pup is too small. Not even a dolphin pup. PAW Patrol to the lookout! Ryder needs us! Whoa! I've got it. ♪ I've got it. (Laughing) (Barking) (Cheering) Wait for me! Whoa! (Others laughing) ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol ready for action. Uh, Marshall? (Panting) Ready for action, Ryder, sir! (Others laughing) PAW Patrol ready for action, Ryder, sir. Thanks for getting here so fast. Cap'n Turbot called. There's a pup in trouble. My tummy did kind of hurt earlier but I think I was just hungry. (Laughing) It's a dolphin pup that needs our help. It took a wrong turn and it's swimming up the river. There's lots of shallow spots and rocks where a little dolphin could get trapped. Zuma, I need you and your hovercraft to help get the dolphin pup back to the ocean. Let's dive in! Chase, I need you to set your net across the river so the dolphin can't swim any farther upstream. Chase is on the case! All right!

(Dolphin clicking) Found him. (Dolphin clicking) Come on, baby dolphin. Back out to the bay where you belong. Your mom and dad are worried. Where did it go? (Dolphin clicking) How did you get back-- there. How are we gonna get the pup back out into the ocean? I don't know. The little dude just wants to play. A playmate, like the toy dolphin you pups were playing with at the beach. Maybe the baby dolphin will follow that out into the bay. Let's do it! (Beeping) Ryder, the baby dolphin's here. But it's in shallow water and it's really rocky. Hurry before he gets stuck. Don't worry, Chase. The PAW Patrol is on it. (Laughing) You'll never get me. Oh, yeah? (Barking) (Laughing) No, I'm stuck. And tag, you're it. (Laughing) (Beeping) Skye! Right here, Ryder. I need you to fly that dolphin toy down to the river and fast! I'm on it. (Yipping) (Grunting) Where is that toy dolphin? Oof! I haven't seen it since it was wearing Marshall's fireman helmet. (Laughing) It's got to be around here somewhere. ♪ Not in here. Oof! Not here either. Guys, it might be in here. (Clattering) Great new look, Marshall. (Laughing) ROCKY: Found it. (Popping) Uh-oh. It popped! (Barking) Ryder, I found the blow-up dolphin, only one small problem. What's that? It popped. That's okay, Rocky. Use your tool arm to patch the hole and then blow it up again. Green means go! We can save this dolphin, guys. Yeah, we can make him bigger, stronger and puffier than before. (Laughing) Glue tube. ♪ Done and done. We just need to pump it with air. ROCKY: I've got just the tool. One more pump. There, we did it! (Cheering) This puppy's got to fly. ♪ Great job. Head out to the bay and see if you can locate the dolphin's family. SKYE: I'm on it. I'll attach the dolphin to your buoy line. (Barking) Buoy line out. Okay, let's give this a try. ♪ ♪ She's following us! She's stoked to have a dolphin friend to play with. RYDER: Skye, any sign of them? SKYE: Ryder, I found the dolphin's family. Great, Skye. Looks like the little pup and its new friend are almost out of the river. ♪ Hey, where did that pup go? Ryder, I think I lost it again. (Dolphin clicking) Wah! Whoa! Whoa! Oof! Ryder! A little help? Zuma, hang on. I'm trying! Ahh! ATV on autopilot. ♪ Thanks, Ryder. Good job. You too, Zuma. That was a totally awesome ride! Guess all pups like to play, even dolphin pups. (Dolphin clicking) (Dolphins clicking excitedly) Great job, pups. The little dolphin is safe and the family is back together again. (Dolphins clicking) That's "thank you" in dolphin speak. Well, in that case, whenever you're in trouble, just... (Dolphins clicking) ...for help. (Dolphins clicking) What are you looking for now? Whales. A whole family is out here migrating south. (Barking) I don't see anything yet, Wally. Well, good luck, Cap'n Turbot. Happy whale watching. (Laughing) ROCKY: Wet, wet, wet, wet! ♪ P-P-P-PAW, PAW, PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ P-P-P-PAW, Patrol ♪ ♪ You're all good pups ♪ ♪ And we saved the day ♪ ♪ And now it's time to play round Adventure Bay ♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa!
