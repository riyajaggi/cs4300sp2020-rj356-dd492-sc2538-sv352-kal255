 ♪ PAW Patrol, whoa-oh-oh-oh ♪ (Dog barking) ♪ (Howling and yelping) Woohoo! Go, Chase! Go, Zuma! Yeah, go pups! That flip was kind of a flop. (Laughing) (Tires squealing) I've got you now. No way, dude. (Howling) It's a tie! ZUMA/CHASE: Again? Catch you next time. (Laughing) ♪ Hey, pups. Hi, Ryder. We're having a contest to see who's the fastest pup. But it keeps ending up a tie. (Laughing) So, Ryder, where's the big surprise for our big trip? Check this out. (Beeping) I wonder what it is. What could it be? I don't know. Is it food? (Truck honking) ♪ Whoa! (Tires squealing) RYDER: Say hello to the PAW Patroller. (Pups cheering and howling) Totally awesome truck! This is how we're going on our road trips? Yep. The Patroller is a lookout on wheels. It can take us anywhere. Sweet! Can we see inside? Sure. Come on! (Pups howling and barking) (Beeping) Check it out. Nice ride! Our pup houses go in there? Sure do. Come on. It gets even cooler. This is the hangout area. That's where you can lounge and play games. (Exclaiming) And check this out: snack machines! Snacks too? What doesn't this truck have? Look, there's even a spot for my ATV. PUPS: Whoa! Yes! (Beeping) And now for the best part. The cab is like the control room at the lookout. This is where I can assign you pups your jobs. Soft! Comfy. Excellent. (Gasping) RUBBLE: RoboDog! (Beeping and barking) PUP: Awesome! RoboDog's programmed to drive the Patroller. Check this out: RoboDog, honk! (Honking) (Howling) Loud! (Phone ringing) Hang on, it's Jake. Watch this. ♪ MARSHALL: A big screen! We can play Pup Pup Boogie! ♪ Do the Pup Pup Boogie! ♪ (Laughing) Maybe later. (Beeping) Hey, Jake. How's the big trip going? It's going amazing! Check it out! PUPS: Aw! Oh, penguins! Oh, you'll see tons more when you and the pups get out here to the ice field. Awesome. The map's up on the screen right now. We input your phone signal into the navigator. That will make it easy to find you. Totally. Hey, and bring lots of eats. You get serious hungry out here. Speaking of, time for a tasty granola bar snack. I-- ooh-- Whoops! RYDER: Careful, Jake. Oh, no! Hah! Oh! Uh-oh! Poor Jake! I got it, got it! RYDER: Jake! Oh, no-- I don't got it. Jake's in big trouble! Don't worry, we're on our way. But the phone fell in the water. And that's the signal we're using to track him. We saved his location on the map. The computer will give us the directions to get there. Pups, get your vehicles. It's time for a road trip. (Cheering) RoboDog, let's roll! (Revving engine) ♪ ♪ ♪ Oh, my phone and everything gone! Deep under ice-cold water. (Ice cracking) Whoa! No! (Panting) Huh? Ugh! Woohoo, I did it! I rescued someone! Sweet save, pup! Thanks! I always wanted to do a real rescue. Sometimes I practise rescuing penguins. But they never say thank you. Or anything, except "Honk!" But that was great, uh... I'm Jake. Hiya, Jake. I'm Everest. (Laughing) So Everest, do you know where I could find a phone around here? No, but we should probably get going. Why? A storm's rolling in. I wouldn't want to lose my first real rescue in a blizzard. Let's wait it out in my igloo. It's just a mile or two across the ice. Do you have any hot cocoa in that igloo? No, but I have some awesome liver-flavoured tea. (Laughing) Water will be fine. ♪ Hope we can make it before the storm hits. (Wind howling) Yikes. It's nose-freezing cold out there. (Panting) Snowy, too! (Laughing) (Tires squealing) Careful, RoboDog. It's a little icy. Slow down a bit. (Barking) (Tires squealing) Great driving. (Barking) You doing okay back there, Jake? Don't worry about me. My pals from the PAW Patrol are on the way. I can't wait to meet them. It gets kind of lonely sometimes. Hey, are you gonna stay around here? It would be great to have a friend nearby. I'm just visiting. I've got a mountain back at Adventure Bay I've go have to look after. (Sniffing) Wind's picking up. We've got to get some shelter till your friends get here. Too bad you're not a pup. Why is that? So you can do this. Whee! Oh, you mean bellybogganing! Look out below! Move over, pup. I'm a bellyboggan pro! (Penguins chirrupping) Show-offs! You've met your match, fur face. Think so, huh? Well, I know a shortcut. (Howling) Whoa! (Whistling through air) (Penguins chirrupping) Are you okay? I'm better than okay. I'm a winner! (Laughing) We're fresh out of hill. Time to walk. Lead the way. Sorry, igloo's still pretty far away. That's okay. Poor Jake. You need to grow your own fur coat like me. But till then... Everest? What are you doing? Digging, silly. We wouldn't have made it to my igloo. This should do it for now. Excellent digging. It's nice and dry in here. And your coat's so awesomely warm. The fleas think so, too. Fleas? Gotcha! (Laughing) (Growling) Uh-oh. Just what we need-- bears. Bears? We don't get a lot of bears around here. (Growling) Uh, yeah, hear that? That's no bear, that's just my tummy. It gets kind of growly when I'm hungry. I've got just the thing. Granola bar. Is it liver-flavoured? No, just plain granola. Okay, thanks. Mm-mm! Yum-a-licious! I sure am glad I rescued you. Aw. Me too, Everest. Me too. ♪ 83 boxes of treats on the wall ♪ ♪ 83 boxes of treats ♪ ♪ Take one down, pass it around ♪ ♪ 82 boxes of treats on the wall ♪ We almost there, Ryder? We're about 30 boxes of treats away. (Tires squealing) PUPS: Whoa! Maybe longer than 30 boxes of treats. (Barking) (Penguins chirrupping) SKYE: Yay! More penguins! Penguins? Are we near water? Hard to tell. Everything's covered in snow. Hey, penguins! Nice suit! (Tires squealing) PUPS: Whoa! This everybody's seatbelt on? Yeah. I'm buckled in. I'm good, too. I'm buckled in. I'm good. Great. Now, easy, RoboDog. Just try to steer out of it. (Tires squealing) Careful. (Rumbling) Whoa! Whee-ee-ee-ee! (Rumbling stopping) Well, the road just got less bumpy. Right, Ryder? I'm not sure this is a road. (Ice cracking) (Tires squealing) Uh-oh. I think we're driving on a frozen lake. And it looks like the ice is cracking. (Ice cracking, everyone exclaiming) (Ice cracking) RoboDog, step on it! We need to get back to the highway! (Engine roaring) (Ice cracking) (Ice cracking) Full speed, RoboDog! (Ice cracking) (Everyone exclaiming) (Tires squealing) Back to the road, RoboDog. (Pups cheering) That was close. (Penguins chirrupping) (Tires squealing) RYDER: We're here, pups. We made it. ♪ According to the map, Jake called us from right around here. PUP: It looks pretty empty. He's probably taken shelter someplace to get out of the storm. Let's find him. Jake! PUPS: Jake! Jake! Jake! Achoo! JAKE: Gesundheit! Oh, no fair. I can't move my arms. I can fix that. Everest, you rock! I rock! I rock! I rock! Wait, so what kind of rock am I? I'll explain it on the way to the igloo. (Barking) (Laughing) No tracks. (Penguins chirrupping) Just more cute penguins. (Skye giggling) (Penguins chirrupping) What was that? A-ha! You're not Jake. (Squawking) Ouch! Sorry. Uh-oh. (Penguins chirrupping) I said sorry. (Sniffing) (Gasping) Zuma, check this out! Jake's phone and knapsack. (Barking) Buoy! I'll tell Ryder. Ruff, ruff! Ryder, we found Jake's phone and backpack. It fell into the water. Now it's frozen solid. Okay. So he was here but that means he doesn't have any supplies. Over there! RYDER: Are those some tracks? (Sniffing) That's Jake all right. Who's this? (Sniffing) Some pup? Ooh, who eats a lot of liver. Those tracks should lead us to them. Let's go. (Sniffing) I don't think we can. They're snowed over. It'll be hard finding Jake under all this fresh snow. No job is too big. No pup is too small. (Beeping) Pups, to the PAW Patroller. Ryder needs us! (Laughing) Whoa, whoa! (Pups barking) Whoa! Whoa! A little snowman for each pup. (Laughing) (Barking and laughing) ♪ PAW Patrol ready for action, Ryder sir! We all know why we're here. Jake's lost and his tracks are covered with snow. We have to find him, fast. Chase, I'll need your tracking skills and police truck to find Jake's path again. Chase is on the case. RYDER: Great. And Skye, I'll need you to search for Jake from above. This puppy's gotta fly! Okay. The rest of you can follow along in the PAW Patroller in case we need more help. PAW Patrol is on a roll! (Barking) ♪ PAW Patrol ♪ (Barking) ♪ Chase! ♪ Ruff! ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ (Laughing) Skye! ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go! ♪ ♪ PAW Patrol, PAW Patrol ♪ ♪ (Reving engine) ♪ Snowmobile! ♪ Skye, any sign of Jake? No Jake. Just snow, snow and more snow. My igloo's just across that ice bridge. Whoa! Will it hold? It's the only way over. (Penguins chirrupping) (Penguins chirrupping) Always showing off. Come on. Okay. Think light thoughts. Feathers, popcorn, fluffy, fluffy clouds. (Ice creaking) Uh-oh. (Sniffing) What is it, Chase? I spy with my little nose something that starts with J. Jake's tracks. BOTH: Let's go! (Barking and howling) (Tires squealing) EVEREST: Uh-oh, the bridge is cracking! I don't think it's gonna hold, Everest. Ryder, I found Jake and the pup! They're stuck on an ice bridge, and the ice is breaking up! Hurry! Hang on, Skye. We're on our way. (Sirens wailing) (Ice cracking) Whoa! I hear something. A helicopter! Look, and some trucks! JAKE: It's the PAW Patrol I told you about. Hey, Chase! (Ice creaking) (Whispering:) Hi. (Ice cracking) Oh! The bridge is falling down! With Jake on it! What do we do now, Ryder? There's more than one way to lift Jake. Chase, is your winch ready? Ruff, winch! Thanks. Skye, use your wings to fly the winch line out to Jake. Chase will pull Jake and the pup off the bridge. If they fall, we can winch them up. Great plan. This puppy's got to fly! (Barking) Wings! ♪ EVEREST: Whoa, a flying pup! That's too cool. Jake, grab the cable and we'll pull you both to safety. SKYE: Catch! Ready to do this? Ready as I'll ever be. Jacob, we're going to retract the cable to pull you over. Ready, Chase? Ready. Guess this is the wrong time to ask for an ear scratch? (Laughing) Hang on. Okay! (Barking) Woohoo! Whoa! Oof! Everest, jump! Don't worry, I've got you, Jake. (Straining) Whoa! (Grunting) BOTH: You okay? (Laughing) I asked you first. I'm great, Everest. Thanks. You saved me. Again! Yes. Two rescues in one day! Best day ever! (Laughing) Jake, you okay? I'm awesome, thanks to Everest, you and the pups. Hey, pups, meet Everest. Everest, this is Ryder and the PAW Patrol. (All saying hello) Hi, Ryder. Hi, pups. Jake told me all about you. I better get you two warmed up. JAKE: Awesome! Thanks, Marshall. Now let's get you inside where it's nice and warm. (Cheering) Here's a biscuit for you, Everest. Mm, liver! Thanks! And thanks for the help, PAW Patrol. Hey, Everest, what are you gonna do now? Guess I have to find another way back to my igloo. I have an idea. You know how you said it can be lonesome out here and all? Do you want to come back to Adventure Bay with us? I could really use a smart pup like you to help out on the mountain. You could? Oh, yeah! Tracking down lost snowboarders, clearing trails, even rescues sometimes. I love rescues! There's room on the PAW Patroller. You mean go with Jake and all you pups? Woohoo! (Laughing) (Growling) Are there b-b-bears around here? Sorry, that's just my hungry tummy. Got any more biscuits? ♪ 83 boxes of treats on the wall ♪ ♪ 83 boxes of treats ♪ ♪ Take one down, pass it around ♪ ♪ Thanks for the treats. And thanks again for rescuing us, Ryder. Couldn't have done it without my pups. Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help. Which reminds me, Everest, I have something for you. (Gasping) Everest, for saving Jake and showing great rescue skills, I'd like to make you an official member of the PAW Patrol. Whoa! PAW Patrol rocks! (Cheering) I don't know what to say except thanks, Ryder. Thanks, pups. Best day ever, ever! (Growling) Was that thunder? Nope, my tummy again. I'm kind of hungry all the time. (Growling) (Laughing) Wait, let me get another marshmallow. A little help? I got this. Best rescue ever! (Laughing) PUP: Yay!
