 COME ON. ...AND A FAITHFUL DOG. HOW ARE YOU DOING? HE WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD. AND THEN EARLY ONE MORNING IN 1964, SOMEONE STABBED HIM TO DEATH IN HIS SWANKY KEY BISCAYNE CONDO. [ GASPS ] HOW'S THAT FOR A SURPRISE ENDING? Lapham: MIAMI IN THE '60s HAD A SHEEN OF GLAMOUR, ILLICIT SIN, GAMBLING, RECKLESS SOWING OF WILD OATS. KEY BISCAYNE WAS SLIGHTLY MORE RESTRAINED. Woman: KEY BISCAYNE WAS JUST A 20-MINUTE DRIVE OVER THE CAUSEWAY FROM MIAMI AND MUCH MORE REFINED THAN DOWNTOWN.

 Lapham: IT WAS MODEST IN ITS PRETENTIONS, BUT IT STILL HAD THE SENSE OF A GATED COMMUNITY. WHICH IS WHY IT WAS SO SHOCKING THAT IT WAS HERE, AT THE EXCLUSIVE GOVERNOR'S LODGE APARTMENTS, THAT JACQUES MOSSLER WAS MURDERED. Kogan: HE'S COVERED WITH A BLANKET. HE'S BEEN STABBED. ACTUALLY, HE HAD 39 STAB WOUNDS. EVEN THE BLANKET THAT COVERED HIM HAD STAB WOUNDS IN IT. THEY GOT HIM GOOD. AND HIS HEAD HAD BEEN BASHED IN BY SOME OBJECT. BENEATH THE BLANKET, JACQUES IS WEARING ONLY A WHITE NIGHTSHIRT. THERE'S A HAIR IN THE PALM OF ONE OF HIS HANDS. THERE'S A GLASS SWAN VASE THAT'S BROKEN, LYING ON THE FLOOR. THEY ALSO FIND ON A COUNTER TWO HIGHBALL GLASSES, ONE WITH THREE CIGARETTE BUTTS IN IT. Kogan: THEY LIFT ONE ARMPRINT ON THE KITCHEN COUNTERTOP. AND THAT WAS THE ONLY PRINT THAT WAS FOUND. Fletcher: YES? HI, GOOD MORNING, MA'AM. THERE WERE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR NEIGHBORS THAT WERE INTERVIEWED AS TO WHAT WAS HEARD AT THE TIME THE MURDER TOOK PLACE. WELL, I HAD JUST GONE TO BED, SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT 2:00 A.M. Krajicek: PEGGY FLETCHER TELLS THEM THAT SHE SAW A COUPLE OF OTHER NEIGHBORS IN THE HALLWAY. THEY DISCUSSED WHAT WAS GOING ON. PRETTY SOON, THE DOG QUIETED DOWN, SO HERBERT AND IRENE AND ALL WENT BACK TO BED. WHAT DID YOU HEAR? HERBERT HOUSE, THE UPSTAIRS NEIGHBOR, TELLS POLICE THAT HE HOLLERED DOWN... [ DOG BARKING ] House: HEY, SHUT THAT DOG UP! ...BECAUSE THE DOG WAS ON THE TERRACE BARKING AT THIS POINT. Jacques: [ In distance ] NO, DON'T DO THAT! HE SAID THAT HE HEARD A MALE VOICE SAYING, "DON'T DO THAT TO ME." AND THEN THERE WAS A SILENCE. [ DOOR OPENS ] Man: AFTER YOU WERE WOKEN BY THE DOG, YOU CAME OUT OF YOUR APARTMENT. Krajicek: A DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR, IRENE DURA WAS ALSO A WITNESS. DID YOU SEE ANYONE THAT YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE? I SAW SOMEBODY JUST GOING AROUND THE CORNER. SHE WALKED OUT AND SAW HIM GET INTO A WHITE CAR. [ KNOCKS ON DOOR ] PARDON ME, MRS. MOSSLER. YES. ANY HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION BEGINS WITH DETECTIVES BUILDING WIDER AND WIDER CIRCLES AROUND THE VICTIM. NOW, PAY ATTENTION. THAT'S CANDACE MOSSLER. CANDY TO HER FRIENDS, SHE WAS JACQUES' WIFE. WE WERE ALL PART OF THE SAME SOCIAL SET BACK IN HOUSTON, WHERE THE MOSSLERS LIVED MOST OF THE TIME. YOU KNOW, PARTIES, AUCTIONS, THE ANNUAL ORDER OF THE ALAMO BALL -- THEY WERE PRACTICALLY ROYALTY. HIS ESTATE, IN THOSE DAYS, WERE WORTH ABOUT $33 MILLION, WHICH IN TODAY'S MARKET IS WORTH A HECK OF A LOT MORE THAN THAT. Rosen: IT'S VERY CUSTOMARY FOR THE POLICE TO LOOK FIRST AT FAMILY MEMBERS. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAD LEFT THE HOUSE EARLIER THIS EVENING. YES, I WAS AT THE HOSPITAL ALL EVENING. RECEIVING TREATMENT FOR...? FOR MY HEADACHES. [ PHONE DIAL CLICKING ] CANDY WAS ONE OF THOSE POOR SOULS WHO SUFFERED WITH MIGRAINES. YEAH, STATE COUNTY? A MOSSLER... YES. Woman: YOU CAN WAIT RIGHT IN HERE, OKAY. THANK YOU. THE DOCTOR WILL BE WITH YOU IN A FEW MINUTES. NOT JUST A BAD HEADACHE SHE CALLED A MIGRAINE, LIKE SOME OF THOSE WILTING VIOLETS WE KNEW, BUT A TERRIBLE, DEBILITATING AFFLICTION. Rosen: THAT NIGHT, SHE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL FOR HER TO GET A SHOT. SHE ARRIVED AT 2:06 A.M. And left at 4:05 A.M. OKAY, THAT'S IT. I APPRECIATE IT. THE 39 STABBINGS WERE ENOUGH TO KILL HIM. THE BLOWS TO THE HEAD WERE ENOUGH TO KILL HIM. WHOEVER WAS KILLING HIM WANTED TO DESTROY THIS MAN. MS. MOSSLER, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF ANYONE WHO WOULD WANT TO HURT YOUR HUSBAND? Candy: [ SIGHS ] SOMEONE FROM WORK, MAYBE, THAT DISLIKED HIM. MOSSLER WAS IN THE FINANCING BUSINESS. AND HE WAS A PRETTY RUTHLESS BUSINESSMAN... ...AND WOULD SEIZE PEOPLE'S CARS, SEIZE THEIR BUSINESSES, SEIZE THEIR HOMES. NOW, I DON'T PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF JACQUES' BUSINESS, AND I'M SURE CANDY DIDN'T EITHER. BACK THEN, WIVES DIDN'T TROUBLE THEMSELVES WITH THAT KIND OF THING. BUT I'D BE LYING IF I TOLD YOU I HADN'T HEARD THAT JACQUES WAS CONSIDERED UNMERCIFUL. HIS ENEMIES WERE A LEGION. THERE WERE ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN SOUTH FLORIDA WITH REASONS TO KILL MOSSLER. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] Woman: JACQUES MOSSLER, ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN I EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING, HAD GOTTEN HIMSELF MURDERED, HIT ON THE HEAD AND STABBED 39 TIMES. SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE WANTED HIM DEAD REAL BAD. QUESTION WAS WHO? Kogan: EVERYBODY KNEW HE WAS A VICIOUS BUSINESSMAN, THAT HE REPOSSESSED CARS, HE FORECLOSED MORTGAGES, AND HAD A LOT OF ENEMIES IN THE BUSINESS WORLD. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, FINDING A KILLER IS LIKE PLANNING A DINNER PARTY. YOU WANT KEEP THE INVITATION LIST SHORT AND WELL-EDITED. BUT WHEN A MAN HAS AS MANY ENEMIES AS JACQUES, THE HOSTESS -- OR DETECTIVES, IN THIS CASE -- WERE GONNA HAVE A DEVIL OF A TIME NARROWING THAT LIST. DO YOU THINK ONE OF THESE MEN CAME BACK TO GET HIM? YES, OF COURSE. ANY PARTICULAR NAMES? WELL, WHO KNOWS FOR SURE? HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN MARRIED? WE JUST HAD OUR 15th WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. CANDY MUST HAVE BEEN TRADING ON HER LOOKS ALL ALONG, JUST HOPING TO LAND A WEALTHY MAN. BUT PEOPLE JUST DON'T REALIZE WHAT CANDY'D ACHIEVED ON HER OWN. Krajicek: SHE MARRIED YOUNG, HAD A COUPLE KIDS. THE MARRIAGE FELL APART FAIRLY QUICKLY. Rosen: SHE BECAME A MODEL AND OPENED A MODELING AND FINISHING SCHOOL. LEFT FLAT WITH TWO LITTLE ONES, THEN SHE UP AND STARTS HER OWN BUSINESS. I DON'T KNOW OF ANOTHER GAL WHO WAS THAT MUCH OF A GO-GETTER AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE. HOW ABOUT SOME BAKED ALASKA? CANDY MET JACQUES WHEN, ON TOP OF RAISING THE CHILDREN AND RUNNING HER BUSINESS, SHE WAS HELPING OUT WITH A FUNDRAISER. I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK THAT THIS DINNER REPLACES THAT DONATION. THE OPERA COMPANY HAS YOU DOWN FOR $300. EVEN BACK THEN, JACQUES' BUSINESS WAS GOING GANGBUSTERS. HE HAD MONEY, AND HE KNEW HOW TO SPEND IT -- ONE OF THOSE TYPES WHO'D BUY A NEW BOAT WHEN HE GOT THE OLD ONE WET. OH, THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. I'M SO PROUD OF THEM. OH, JUST LIKE THEIR DADDY. THIS ONE, SHE IS SMART AS A WHIP. JACQUES HAD JUST BEEN THROUGH A NASTY DIVORCE HIMSELF. HIS EX HAD TAKEN HIM FOR A PRETTY PENNY, BUT HE STILL GOT TO SEE HIS CHILDREN. THIS IS MY RITA, MY OLDEST, LOOKS JUST LIKE HER MAMA. SHE IS ADORABLE, JUST LIKE HER MAMA. [ GIGGLES ] THERE WAS THE USUAL UGLY TALK ABOUT HER BEING HIS TROPHY AND HIM BEING HER MEAL TICKET, BUT THAT WAS NONSENSE. CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN? CERTAINLY. WE HAVE 10 CHILDREN BETWEEN THE TWO OF US. THAT'S AN IMPRESSIVE FAMILY YOU HAVE. Kogan: SHE HAD TWO BY A PRIOR MARRIAGE, HE HAD FOUR DAUGHTERS BY A PRIOR MARRIAGE, AND THEN THEY ADOPTED FOUR. Krajicek: HE BUILT HER A FABULOUS MANSION IN HOUSTON. THEY HAD A GRAND LIFE TOGETHER. THEY WERE QUITE A TEAM. AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, 10 CHILDREN, THEY ALSO ENDED UP TAKING IN CANDY'S NEPHEW. MELVIN POWERS IS THE 22-YEAR-OLD SON OF CANDY'S OLDER SISTER. OF COURSE, THE POLICE TAKE STOCK OF ANYONE WHO IS A PART OF THAT TIGHT CIRCLE AROUND THE VICTIM. BUT OBVIOUSLY, MELVIN POWERS LIVED IN HOUSTON. AND THE HOMICIDE TOOK PLACE AT THE GOVERNOR'S LODGE IN KEY BISCAYNE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE THIS TO YOUR HUSBAND? JACQUES HAD, UH, CHANGED. THEY HAD A FABULOUS RELATIONSHIP FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS. BUT JACQUES WAS NO SPRING CHICKEN WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED. AND AFTER ABOUT 10 YEARS, HIS AGE WAS STARTING TO SHOW. IN ABOUT 1962, MR. MOSSLER SUFFERED SOME MEDICAL PROBLEMS, EXPERIENCED RESPIRATORY FAILURE. Krajicek: HE TRAVELED TO EUROPE BY HIMSELF TO GET TREATMENT FOR HIS RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS. JACQUES WAS AWAY FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR, AND WHEN HE CAME BACK, HE WAS LIKE A WHOLE NEW MAN. HE SAID THE OCEAN AIR WAS BETTER FOR HIM THAN STEAMY, OLD HOUSTON. SO HE STARTED SPENDING BIG STRETCHES OF TIME IN MIAMI, STAYING IN THE COMPANY APARTMENT. MA'AM. WHEN JACQUES MOVED TO FLORIDA, HE MADE A COUPLE OF NEW FRIENDS -- MALE FRIENDS MOSTLY. Krajicek: CANDY TELLS INVESTIGATORS THAT IN THIS PERIOD, HIS PERSONALITY CHANGED. WELL, I DON'T WANT TO PUT, UH, OUR FAMILY BUSINESS OUT INTO THE WORLD. Rosen: CANDACE WAS CONCERNED THAT HE WAS EXHIBITING CERTAIN HOMOSEXUAL TENDENCIES. Krajicek: HE WOULD MEET A STRANGE MAN AND INVITE HIM BACK TO HIS APARTMENT FOR LATE-NIGHT CONVERSATIONS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ONE OF THOSE MEN COULD DO. AND SHE SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS THIS MURDER WAS ABOUT A GAY AFFAIR GONE BAD. Woman: JACQUES MOSSLER WAS DEAD, AND NOTHING WAS GONNA CHANGE THAT. BUT THEN, THE THINGS THAT CANDY WAS SAYING ABOUT JACQUES, WELL, THEY REALLY MADE ME WONDER IF I EVER KNEW THE MAN AT ALL. Lapham: ACCORDING TO CANDY, HE HAD MANY LOVERS WITH WHOM HE WOULD OFTEN QUARREL. DO YOU KNOW THE NAME OF ANY OF THESE MEN? C-A-L... T-A-G... WHEN JACQUES MOSSLER DECIDED TO SPEND MORE TIME IN MIAMI, HE HAD VERY UNUSUAL LIVING ARRANGEMENTS FOR A MULTIMILLIONAIRE. HE WAS LIVING IN A SMALL APARTMENT ABOVE ONE OF HIS OFFICES... ...WITH THIS FELLOW NAMED VINCENT CALTAGIRONE. Rosen: HE WAS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE BANK, A MUCH YOUNGER MAN. AND PREVIOUSLY, MR. MOSSLER HAD HIM LIVE WITH HIM, NOT PAYING ANY RENT. HOW DID YOU COME TO KNOW MR. MOSSLER? I WAS WORKING FOR MR. MOSSLER IN HOUSTON, AND WHEN I TRANSFERRED TO MIAMI, I TOOK A PAY CUT. SO I INSISTED ON A FURNISHED APARTMENT AS PART OF THE DEAL. Man: RUNNERS ON FIRST AND SECOND WITH NO OUTS, AND HARVEY'S UP TO BAT. MOSSLER HAD ME STAY IN HIS PENTHOUSE TO SAVE HIMSELF SOME MONEY. I SLEPT ON THE PULLOUT SOFA. DONE, IT'S ALL YOURS. YOU DON'T GET THAT RICH WITHOUT BEING FRUGAL. THAT WAS JACQUES. SO WHERE WERE YOU THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER? I WAS WITH JACQUES EARLIER IN THE EVENING. BUT I WAS AT HOME, IN BED ALONE, AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS MURDERED. Kogan: HE HAD NO ALIBI, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD CONNECT CALTAGIRONE TO THE HOMICIDE OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT, THAT AT ONE TIME, THEY HAD SHARED THE SAME APARTMENT. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. Woman: ALL THAT CAME OUT OF THAT WAS A LOT OF UGLY TALK AND RUMORS. MR. CALTAGIRONE SWORE UP AND DOWN THAT NEITHER HE NOR JACQUES WAS A HOMOSEXUAL. CANDY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. NOW THE ONLY REAL LEAD THE MIAMI POLICE HAD WAS THE CAR THAT WAS SEEN LEAVING THE GOVERNOR'S LODGE THAT NIGHT. Krajicek: THEY SEARCHED THE RECORDS FOR JACQUES MOSSLER'S COMPANY FOR A POSSIBLE LINK TO A WHITE CHEVROLET. AND SURE ENOUGH, THEY FIND ONE. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE COMPANY HAS A WHITE CHEVROLET THAT HAD BEEN REPO'd THAT THE FAMILY HAD BEEN USING. THAT WAS ONE OF THE PERKS OF BEING MRS. JACQUES MOSSLER. YOU SEE, IF JACQUES' COMPANY LOANED YOU MONEY TO BUY A NEW CAR, AND YOU MISSED A PAYMENT, CANDY WAS WAITING RIGHT THERE TO TAKE A SPIN IN HER NEW -- WELL, ALMOST NEW -- RIDE. OKAY, THIS IS IT. THE CAR MANAGER FOR THE COMPANY SAYS, "TALK TO ROSCOE BROWN." ROSCOE BROWN WORKED FOR MR. MOSSLER IN MIAMI, BUT HE WAS ALSO SORT OF A GO-TO GUY AS KIND OF LIKE THE FAMILY'S FIXER. OFTEN, HE DEALT WITH ISSUES WITH CANDY'S TRANSPORTATION AND SO FORTH. Kogan: WELL, ROSCOE BROWN TOLD THE DETECTIVES THAT, YEAH, HE KNOWS ABOUT THAT WHITE CHEVROLET, BECAUSE HE DELIVERED IT TO CANDACE IN MIAMI SIX DAYS BEFORE JACQUES MOSSLER WAS KILLED. CANDY WAS COMING BACK FROM A TRIP TO THE BAHAMAS. IT WAS A FAMILY TRIP. WITH HER THAT DAY WERE HER DAUGHTER, RITA, RITA'S FIANCé, AND CANDY'S NEPHEW. AND ROSCOE MET HER AT THE AIRPORT WITH THE CAR. Man: WELL, WELCOME, MRS. MOSSLER. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. DETECTIVE. TELL ME ABOUT THIS WHITE CHEVROLET. CANDY EXPLAINS THAT SHE DID HAVE A WHITE CHEVROLET, BUT SHE RETURNED IT TO THE COMPANY THREE DAYS BEFORE THE HOMICIDE HAPPENED. THE COMPANY SAYS IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY RECORD OF WHERE THE CAR HAD GONE... ...SO THE POLICE PUT OUT AN ALL-POINTS BULLETIN. WOMAN: Attention, all units, Be on the lookout for a stolen vehicle, late-model Chevrolet, white in color, reported missing. Krajicek: AND THEY FIND IT. Kogan: THE CAR IS LOCATED AT MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN ONE OF THE PARKING LOTS. WHY IS IT THERE? IF CANDY SAYS SHE DROPPED THE CAR BACK OFF AT THE COMPANY LOT, BUT THE FOLKS AT THE COMPANY SAY IT NEVER CAME BACK, WELL, THAT'S KIND OF A "HE SAID, SHE SAID." IF I WERE THE POLICE, I'D HAVE BEEN ASKING, "WHAT WAS THE LAST TIME WE KNOW FOR SURE WHERE THAT CAR WAS?" Man: WHAT WAS THE NAME OF CANDY'S NEPHEW? IT WAS, UH, MELVIN POWERS. Kogan: WELL, IT'S TIME TO MORE COMPLETELY CHECK OUT MELVIN POWERS. AND THAT'S WHEN THOSE DETECTIVES IN FLORIDA GOT WIND OF A LITTLE SMIDGE OF GOSSIP OUT OF HOUSTON. MELVIN, HE HAD BEEN A BIT OF A HANDFUL. Rosen: HE HAD BEEN IN SOME TROUBLE EARLIER IN HIS YOUTH, AND CANDACE'S SISTER ASKED IF SHE COULD PLEASE GIVE HIM A JOB AND PLEASE TRY TO STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT. Candy: [ LAUGHS ] Krajicek: JACQUES HIRED HIM AT A HANDSOME SALARY WITH THE IDEA THAT HE WAS GOING TO GROOM HIM TO BE A MANAGER FOR ONE OF HIS BUSINESSES. Rosen: YOU KNOW, CANDACE BECAME VERY CLOSE WITH HIM. AND JACQUES MOSSLER TREATED HIM LIKE A SON. IF THOSE DETECTIVES ARE MAKING UP THAT SHORT, WELL-EDITED LIST OF PEOPLE TO INVITE TO THE INVESTIGATION, I'D SAY NEPHEW MELVIN HAD MADE THE CUT. Krajicek: AND POLICE BEGAN WORKING ANGLES IN HOUSTON. AND THEY LEARNED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A CONFRONTATION A YEAR BEFORE... ...WHERE JACQUES MOSSLER KICKED MELVIN POWERS OUT OF THE HOUSE. Kogan: AND POWERS SAID, "I'M NOT GETTING OUT OF THIS HOUSE." SO MOSSLER CALLED THE POLICE. Krajicek: NATURALLY, POLICE WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN JACQUES MOSSLER AND MELVIN POWERS. AND THAT WAS ANOTHER, SLIGHTLY BIGGER SMIDGE OF GOSSIP. Woman: CANDY LOVED JACQUES IN HER OWN WAY. BUT WHAT'S THAT SAYING? "WOMEN KEEP A SPECIAL PLACE IN THEIR HEARTS FOR SINS THEY'VE NEVER COMMITTED." SURE, THAT IS UNTIL THEY DO. HOW DO I LOOK? AND THEN THEY KEEP A SPECIAL PLACE IN THEIR CALENDAR FOR THEM. * A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND * * YOU ALWAYS GET THE OTHER KIND * GIVE ME THAT. NO. UH-HUH. [ LAUGHS ] YOU BETTER WATCH OUT. THAT COST MONEY. * YOU LOOK FOR HIM AND FIND HIM FOOLIN' 'ROUND SOME OTHER GAL * NO. * THEN YOU RAVE, EVEN CRAVE * * TO SEE HIM LAYIN' IN HIS GRAVE * Black: AND THIS IS NOT SOME DISTANT RELATIVE. THIS IS HER SISTER'S SON THAT SHE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH. THERE'S BEEN A COURTSHIP, BRIEF BUT INTENSE. BUT BEFORE THE ACT OF MUTUAL GOOD FEELING TAKES PLACE, CANDY REQUIRED MELVIN TO HAVE FOUR MINOR OPERATIONS. FIRST OF ALL, HE HAD TO BE CIRCUMCISED. SECONDLY, HE HAD TO HAVE HIS EARS PINNED TO THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD. THIRDLY, HE HAD A ROUGH COMPLEXION, AND IT HAD TO BE SMOOTHED OUT, AND THEN ALSO HAVE HIS TONSILS REMOVED IN THE EVENT THAT HE SNORED. IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE HAD, YOU KNOW, PASSED THESE TRIALS THAT HE WAS ALLOWED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY GRAIL. * TO SEE HIM LAYIN' IN HIS GRAVE * * SO IF YOUR MAN IS NICE, TAKE MY ADVICE * Krajicek: MELVIN BRAGGED ABOUT THE SEXUAL POWER THAT HE HAS OVER CANDY, SPECIFICALLY ORAL SEX. * 'CAUSE A GOOD MAN NOWADAYS IS HARD TO FIND * Kogan: THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED AT THE MANSION ALL KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW THE FAMILY THERE -- THIS WAS NOT A SECRET IN HOUSTON. Lapham: THEY'D MEET IN VARIOUS MOTELS. THEY'D DRIVE AROUND TOGETHER IN A LARGE AND FLASHY CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE. Krajicek: THERE HAD BEEN WHISPERS ABOUT IT FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS. AND FINALLY, SOMEBODY WHISPERED TO JACQUES MOSSLER HIMSELF. JACQUES LOOKS AT CANDY'S DIARY. AND IN THE DIARY, CANDY REVEALS ALL. Rosen: AND IT WAS AT THAT POINT THAT MR. MOSSLER FIRED MEL POWERS FROM THE POSITION AT THE BANK AND ORDERED MEL POWERS OUT OF THE HOUSE. AND THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME TIME WE HEARD THAT JACQUES HAD GOTTEN HIMSELF THAT SWANKY APARTMENT AT THE GOVERNOR'S LODGE IN KEY BISCAYNE. MELVIN POWERS HAS NOW BECOME THE KEY PERSON OF INTEREST IN THIS CASE. [ PHONE RINGS ] NOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING, "MELVIN MAY HAVE BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE HOUSE, "BUT HE WAS STILL LIVING IN HOUSTON. "JACQUES WAS KILLED IN FLORIDA, SO HOW COULD MELVIN HAVE DONE IT?" THEY START TALKING TO SOME OF THE AIRPORT PERSONNEL, AND THEY DISCOVER THAT, THE DATE OF THE MURDER, MEL POWERS CAUGHT A PLANE IN HOUSTON, PAID CASH FOR IT, AND THAT HE WAS IN A REAL RUSH. HE SAID HE HAD TO CATCH THAT PLANE. Krajicek: HE FLEW FROM HOUSTON TO MIAMI ON THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THE LATE-NIGHT MURDER. AND HE FLEW OUT OF MIAMI BACK TO HOUSTON FEWER THAN SEVEN HOURS AFTER JACQUES MOSSLER WAS KILLED. THE AUTHORITIES HAD COME UP WITH A FAIRLY DAMNING LIST OF EVIDENCE AGAINST MELVIN POWERS. HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH CANDACE MOSSLER. HE'D HAD A CONFRONTATION WITH JACQUES MOSSLER OVER THAT AFFAIR AND OVER HIS JOB. THERE'S THE STRANGE, QUICKIE TRIP FROM HOUSTON TO MIAMI. [ UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS ] ON A HUNCH, THEY START CHECKING AT BARS AND RESTAURANTS ON THE CAUSEWAY LEADING FROM THE AIRPORT TO KEY BISCAYNE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT A MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN HERE ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO. THEY FIND OUT THAT MEL POWERS, AFTER ARRIVAL IN MIAMI, GOES TO A CLUB CALLED THE STUFFED SHIRT. Krajicek: MEL PAID TWO SEPARATE VISITS THERE ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER... ...ONE NOT LONG AFTER HIS PLANE HAD LANDED AND THEN ANOTHER TIME NEARLY MIDNIGHT THAT SAME NIGHT. THAT BAR WAS SMACK-DAB ON THE ROAD BETWEEN THE AIRPORT AND THE GOVERNOR'S LODGE. AND MELVIN WAS THERE JUST HOURS BEFORE JACQUES WAS KILLED. THANK YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PERRY MASON TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. SO POLICE FEEL WE GOT ENOUGH TO ARREST THIS GUY AND CHARGE HIM WITH MOSSLER'S MURDER. Krajicek: AFTER THE ARREST, SEVERAL NEW PIECES OF EVIDENCE TURN UP. THE ONE PRINT THAT WAS LIFTED FROM THE COUNTERTOP TURNS OUT TO BE MELVIN LANE POWERS' PALM PRINT. IF THAT'S NOT THE HAND IN THE COOKIE JAR, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. AND IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR THOSE DETECTIVES TO START WONDERING, "WAS THIS REALLY ALL MELVIN'S IDEA ON HIS OWN?" BUT CANDY LEFT MIAMI BEFORE THEY COULD TALK TO HER. IT WAS HER MIGRAINES, SHE SAID. SHE CHECKED HERSELF INTO THE MAYO CLINIC IN MINNESOTA INDEFINITELY. THE INVESTIGATORS ARE CONVINCED THAT CANDACE IS PART AND PARCEL OF THIS. Lapham: THE POLICE BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN MELVIN AND CANDY, THAT THIS WAS A JOINT VENTURE. BUT MURDER IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS. IF CANDY WAS THROUGH WITH JACQUES, SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL HIM. SHE COULD HAVE JUST DIVORCED HIM, RIGHT? Krajicek: CANDY HAD A PRENUP AGREEMENT. SHE WOULD ONLY GET $200,000 IF SHE FILED FOR DIVORCE. Kogan: SO, IF CANDACE WANTED HIS MONEY, THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY FOR HER TO GET IT. AND THAT WAS FOR JACQUES TO DIE BEFORE SHE DID. SHE LIKED WHAT JACQUES HAD TO OFFER, AND SHE CERTAINLY LIKED WHAT MEL HAD TO OFFER. BUT CHOOSING BETWEEN THEM, THAT WASN'T CANDY'S STYLE. SHE WAS ALWAYS GO-GETTER, REMEMBER? Black: IT'S A VERY STRONG CIRCUMSTANTIAL CASE AGAINST POWERS, BUT THERE'S REALLY NO CASE AGAINST CANDACE. AND SO THEY SPEND MONTHS HERE TRYING TO GET EVIDENCE TO DRAG HER IN. SO THE MIAMI POLICE CALLED IN ROSCOE BROWN AGAIN TO SEE IF MAYBE THEY DUG A LITTLE DEEPER, THEY'D STRIKE OIL. HI, MR. BROWN. HAVE A SEAT. AND SURE ENOUGH, THEY DID. Krajicek: TURNS OUT THAT ON JUNE 29th, THE DAY BEFORE THE MURDER, ROSCOE WAS INVOLVED IN SOME MORE JOCKEYING HAVING TO DO WITH THAT WHITE CHEVROLET. OH, ROSCOE. YOU'VE OUTDONE YOURSELF. MISS CANDACE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. Rosen: HE SAID THAT HE HAD WASHED AND GASSED UP THE CAR AT THE GOVERNOR'S LODGE IN KEY BISCAYNE AND THAT HE HAD SEEN CANDACE MOSSLER DRIVE AWAY WITH IT THE DAY MR. MOSSLER HAD BEEN MURDERED. Krajicek: THIS DIRECTLY CONTRADICTED CANDY'S CONTENTION THAT SHE HADN'T SEEN THE CAR FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS BEFORE THE HOMICIDE TOOK PLACE. ROSCOE DIDN'T KNOW THAT CANDY TOLD THE POLICE THAT SHE'D RETURNED THE CAR, AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN AWFUL WHEN HE REALIZED THAT HIS VERSION OF EVENTS PUT CANDY IN A TIGHT SPOT, LED TO THE POLICE ASKING MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT CANDY'S VISIT TO THE HOSPITAL THAT NIGHT. SO YOU HAD MENTIONED BEFORE THAT THE NIGHT OF THE CRIME, MS. MOSSLER WAS HERE. YES, THAT'S RIGHT. Rosen: THE INVESTIGATORS BEGAN TALKING TO WITNESSES AT JACKSON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL. ACTUALLY, SHE RECEIVED THREE PHONE CALLS THAT NIGHT. [ PHONE RINGS ] GOOD MORNING, EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. SURE. MRS. MOSSLER, PHONE FOR YOU. THE NIGHT THAT THE MURDER OCCURRED, SHE RECEIVES SEVERAL TELEPHONE CALLS. IT WAS THE SAME MAN'S VOICE. THE LAST PHONE CALL WAS CLOSE TO 4:30 A.M. IT WAS THE POLICE'S THEORY THAT IT WAS MEL POWERS TELLING HER, "ALL IS CLEAR. YOU CAN COME BACK TO THE APARTMENT NOW." BEFORE WE KNEW IT, CANDY MOSSLER WAS UNDER ARREST FOR MURDER. NOW, MONEY MAY NOT BUY HAPPINESS, BUT IT SURE BUYS A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. AND LET'S JUST SAY CANDY HAD MORE THAN DIAMONDS UP HER SLEEVE. Man: THIS IS WHERE THE BIG LEGAL DRAMA OF THE YEAR, PERHAPS THE BIGGEST IN THE UNITED STATES, WILL BEGIN NEXT WEEK WHEN THE MOSSLER MURDER CASE OPENS. THE STATE CHARGES THAT JACQUES MOSSLER WAS MURDERED BECAUSE HE OBJECTED TO THE ALLEGED LOVE AFFAIR BETWEEN HIS WIFE AND HER NEPHEW. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] THE MOSSLER TRIAL WAS THE SENSATION OF THE SEASON. THIS CASE BECAME NOTORIOUS FOR THREE THINGS -- SEX, MONEY, AND MURDER. Krajicek: THERE WAS FRONT-PAGE COVERAGE COAST TO COAST. WHAT IS THE BIG ATTRACTION? WELL, I THINK IT'S EXCITING, AND IT HAS MYSTERY, IT'S A VERY UNUSUAL CASE. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] THE BEST CRIME AND COURT REPORTERS AT THE BIGGEST PAPERS IN THE COUNTRY FLOCKED TO MIAMI TO COVER THIS. Woman: THAT MAN RIGHT THERE IS JACQUES' BROTHER, MARCU. HE CAME ALL THE WAY FROM ISRAEL TO SEE JUSTICE DONE. [ GAVEL BANGS ] THE TRIAL BEGAN AT THE BEGINNING OF 1966. AND WHEN IT STARTED, IT KICKED OFF WITH A BANG -- A MAN NAMED BILLY MULVEY, A SURPRISE WITNESS. [ GAVEL BANGS ] Man: WHAT TIME OF DAY WAS THIS? Mulvey: AROUND MIDNIGHT, I'D SAY. YEAH, I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT YOUR DESCRIPTION OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DECEASED. I BARELY KNEW THE MAN. Krajicek: MULVEY TELLS INVESTIGATORS THAT HE WAS APPROACHED BY CANDY MOSSLER AND MELVIN POWERS TOGETHER. THEY WERE SOLICITING A HIT ON JACQUES MOSSLER. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. HE'S IN THE APARTMENT BY HIMSELF MOST TIMES. THEY GOT A VACATION HOUSE. THEY PAID ME THE $7,000 BUT NEVER GAVE ME THE OTHER $3,000. SO I DIDN'T DO IT. THE INVESTIGATORS MUST HAVE COME UP WITH AT LEAST SIX PEOPLE WHO SAID THAT THEY HAD BEEN OFFERED MONEY TO KILL MR. MOSSLER. ONCE THE PROSECUTOR SHOWED THAT CANDY AND MEL WANTED JACQUES DEAD -- I THINK THEY CALL IT "ESTABLISHING MOTIVE" -- THEN THEY GOT TO THE MAIN EVENT, EXPLAINING HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE DONE IT. Krajicek: MELVIN WAS FLYING IN TO THE MIAMI AIRPORT AT ABOUT 6:00. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] CANDACE PICKS HIM UP IN THE WHITE CHEVROLET. Rosen: MEL POWERS WENT TO THE STUFFED SHIRT. HE KILLED SOME TIME HAVING A DRINK. Lapham: AT 1:30 IN THE MORNING, CANDACE AND HER CHILDREN LEAVE THE GOVERNOR'S LODGE BECAUSE SHE IS SUFFERING FROM A VIOLENT MIGRAINE, GOES TO A NEARBY HOSPITAL FOR RELIEF. 15 MINUTES LATER, MELVIN ARRIVES AND ENTERS THE APARTMENT. Krajicek: JACQUES MOSSLER IS AWAKENED SOMEHOW. HE'S WEARING ONLY A NIGHTSHIRT, SO HE GRABS THIS ORANGE BLANKET AND PUTS IT OVER HIM AND WALKS OUT TO SEE WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON. AND THERE HE FINDS MELVIN POWERS. [ DOG BARKS ] Jacques: NO, DON'T DO THAT! [ DOG BARKING ] Kogan: IT HAPPENED FAST, OR AS FAST AS IT TAKES TO STAB SOMEBODY 39 TIMES AND BASH THEIR HEAD IN. Krajicek: HE THEN GETS UP, WASHES HIS HANDS IN THE KITCHEN SINK THERE AND, IN THE PROCESS, LEAVES A PALM PRINT ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER. HE THEN SLIPS OUT OF THE APARTMENT, GETS INTO A WHITE CHEVROLET, AND DRIVES AWAY. [ PHONE RINGS ] PROSECUTORS ALLEGE THAT MELVIN THEN WENT AND FOUND A PHONE AND CALLED CANDY AT THE HOSPITAL AND TOLD HER THAT THE DEED WAS DONE, AND IT WAS SAFE TO GO HOME. IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T LOOK GOOD FOR CANDY AND MEL. BUT THE STAR OF THE NEXT PART OF THE TRIAL WAS THE FORMIDABLE PERCY FOREMAN, A MAN SO SLICK, THEY SAID HE COULD CHARM THE SKIN OFF A SNAKE. Lapham: PERCY FOREMAN WAS THE DOMINANT FIGURE AT THE TRIAL. IT WAS HIS SHOW. NOW, LET ME BEGIN BY -- BY COMMENDING THE PROSECUTION FOR THEIR COURAGE. I NEVER ONCE TRIED A CASE IN WHICH THE PROSECUTION DARED TO COME TO TRIAL WITH LITTLE OR NO EVIDENCE. [ LAUGHS ] Black: THERE WERE REALLY TWO IMPORTANT PIECES OF FORENSIC EVIDENCE. ONE WAS THE PALM PRINT, WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO MATCH WITH MELVIN LANE POWERS. HOWEVER, THEY ALSO HAD THIS HAIR THAT WAS FOUND IN MOSSLER'S HAND THAT DID NOT MATCH MELVIN POWERS OR CANDACE MOSSLER. AND THIS, OF COURSE, OPENED THE DOOR TO THE DEFENSE ARGUING THAT SOME UNKNOWN PERSON COMMITTED THE MURDER. Foreman: MOSSLER WAS AS RUTHLESS, AMBITIOUS AS ANY PIRATE THAT EVER SAILED THE SEA OF COMMERCE. IF EACH OF THE 39 WOUNDS ON THE BODY OF THE DECEASED HAD BEEN INFLICTED BY 39 DIFFERENT PEOPLE, THERE STILL WOULD BE THREE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA WHO WANT THE DEATH OF JACQUES MOSSLER. Black: FOREMAN TRIED TO GET THE JURY SO DISGUSTED AT THE VICTIM THAT THEY'D WANT TO DIG HIM UP AND KILL HIM ALL OVER AGAIN. Foreman: HOW MANY CRIMES HAVE YOU COMMITTED, SIR? FIVE FELONIES. FIVE FELONIES. AND THEN, MR. FOREMAN PUT BILLY MULVEY BACK ON THE STAND AND JUST EVISCERATED HIM. Lapham: FOREMAN PLAYED WITH MULVEY THE WAY A LARGE PREDATORY BIRD PLAYS WITH A DEAD RABBIT. Black: NOW, PERCY FOREMAN IS NOT A GREAT LEGAL SCHOLAR. WHAT HE COULD DO IS GET ON HIS FEET AND MAKE AN IMPASSIONED ARGUMENT. AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID. Foreman: THERE'S A -- A SCRIPTURE IN THE BIBLE. THE ADULTERESS IS BROUGHT TO JESUS IN THE TEMPLE. THE MOB WANTED TO STONE HER, BUT JESUS SAID, "LET HIM WITHOUT SIN CAST THE FIRST STONE." AND JESUS WAS ALONE WITH THE ADULTERESS, AND JESUS SAID TO HER... ... "NEITHER DO I CONDEMN YOU." Lapham: HIS CLOSING STATEMENT TO THE JURY WENT ON FOR FIVE HOURS WITH QUOTATIONS FROM THE ENTIRE THESAURUS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION. YOUR HONOR, THE DEFENSE RESTS. Black: WHAT PERCY FOREMAN AND THE DEFENSE LAWYERS HAD TO DO IN THIS TRIAL WAS RAISE A REASONABLE DOUBT. THEY DID NOT HAVE TO PROVE THEIR INNOCENCE. THEY JUST HAD TO POKE HOLES IN THE PROSECUTION'S CASE. Kogan: STATE OF FLORIDA v. MELVIN LANE POWERS AND CANDACE MOSSLER, WE THE JURY AT MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA, FIND THE DEFENDANTS, MELVIN LANE POWERS AND CANDACE MOSSLER, NOT GUILTY. OH! OH! [ APPLAUSE ] I WAS OF TWO MINDS ABOUT IT. I WON'T LIE. I WAS RELIEVED TO SEE MY FRIEND GO FREE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT DIDN'T FEEL QUITE LIKE JUSTICE. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] Woman: TO THIS DAY, I STILL THINK ABOUT IT AND WONDER. IF YOU HAD EVERYTHING YOU WANTED JUST DANGLING OUT IN FRONT OF YOU, WOULDN'T YOU BE TEMPTED TO JUST REACH OUT AND TAKE IT? THEY DRIVE OFF TOGETHER IN TRIUMPH WITH TV CAMERAS, A CHEERING CROWD. IT'S LIKE A HOMECOMING QUEEN. Black: NOW, WE MAY SPECULATE THAT THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE, PARTICULARLY AGAINST POWERS. BUT IN ALL FAIRNESS, THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL PRESUMED INNOCENT.
