 WAS DISCOVERED DEAD EARLY THIS MORNING APPARENTLY THE VICTIM OF A BRUTAL ATTACK. POLICE ARE ON THE SCENE... - SIR, BE CAREFUL. - MY GOD. MY GOD. THAT'S MY WIFE. THEY JUST SAID MY WIFE'S NAME. DID YOU HEAR THAT? SIR. I -- I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE. NO, NO, I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE. AND NO MATTER HOW MANY DEALS YOU CLOSE OR PALMS YOU GREASE, MONEY CAN'T KEEP THE ONES YOU LOVE SAFE FROM HARM. THAT'S HOW THIS STORY BEGINS. IN 1960, MACON, GEORGIA, WAS A SLEEPY LITTLE TOWN FOR SOME. BUT OUR SPHERE WAS A WORLD APART

 FROM ANYTHING YOU'D RECOGNIZE THEN OR NOW. FOR A SELECT FEW, MACON WAS A CITY OF FLOWERS AND GARDENS AND ABOVE ALL, PARTIES. PROPRIETY DEMANDED YOU DON YOUR FINEST TUXEDO AND MOST CHARMING SMILE BECAUSE, WELL, THAT'S SIMPLY HOW THINGS WORKED. APPEARANCES WERE PRIZED ABOVE ALL. AND IN A PLACE WITH SUCH RIGID DECORUM, AT TIMES IT DID FEEL LIKE WE WERE ON A STAGE. WITH EVERYBODY SO BUSY PLAYING A PART, YOU WERE GUARANTEED TO END UP WITH A FEW CHARACTERS. PEOPLE CULTIVATED THEIR PERSONALITIES LIKE THEIR GRANDADDIES DID COTTON -- IN LARGE QUANTITIES. BUT IT MUST BE SAID, OUR LITTLE FARCE... WAS, IN EQUAL MEASURE, A TRAGEDY. MR. AND MRS. BURGE LIVED IN THE NICEST NEIGHBORHOOD, THE MOST, WEALTHY ENCLAVE OF THE CITY. THERE WERE LIGATURE MARKS AROUND HER NECK. HER FACE WAS BRUISED. RIGOR MORTIS HAS ALREADY SET IN. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT, MISS BURGE HAD BEEN STRANGLED TO DEATH AT AROUND MIDNIGHT. SHE HAD A 10-KARAT DIAMOND RING THAT SHE WORE. LOOKS LIKE THAT ROCK'S GONE. THE RING WAS THERE, BUT THERE WAS NO DIAMOND STONE. WHEN THE POLICE START LOOKING THROUGH THE ROOM, THEY SEE A BLOOD TRAIL. SO IT LOOKS AS THOUGH SHE HAS DIED, PERHAPS, ON THE CARPET AND HAS BEEN PICKED UP AND PLACED ON THE BED. DID YOU SEE THE DOOR? LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY TRIED TO JIMMY IT. MISS BURGE HAD A CLOSET IN HER BEDROOM THAT WAS LOCKED. THE HINGES TO THAT DOOR HAD BEEN JIMMIED UP AND WOULD APPEAR TO BE AN EFFORT BY SOMEONE TO GET INTO THAT CLOSET. AND ON THE DOOR TO THE CLOSET, THEY DID FIND A FEW FINGERPRINTS AND A PALM PRINT. WHO FOUND THE BODY? POLICE OFFICERS TALKED TO JESSIE, THE MAID, TO SEE WHAT SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. WHAT MADE YOU GO UP TO MRS. BURGE'S ROOM? I WENT TO GO WAKE HER UP. SHE NEVER SLEEPS PAST 9:00. MISS MARY, IT'S 9:00, MA'AM. I OPEN THE CURTAINS, JUST TO LET SOME SUNSHINE IN. GOD BLESS HER SOUL. THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE? NO, SIR. WAS THERE ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE PAST FEW DAYS THAT YOU CAN RECALL? WELL, THERE WAS THIS TERRIBLE THING WITH MISS MARY'S BIRD. JESSIMAE! JESSIMAE, COME QUICKLY! JESSIMAE... MARY'S PET PARROT HAD PASSED AWAY THE DAY BEFORE. YOU KNOW, ANYTIME SOMEONE WALKED INTO THAT HOUSE, THAT BIRD WOULD RAISE QUITE A RUCKUS. IF IT HAD STILL BEEN ALIVE, MRS. BURGE WOULD HAVE SURELY KNOWN SOMEONE WAS SNEAKING UP ON HER. WHAT -- WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS? AND WHAT ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE DOING HERE? MARY'S HUSBAND, CHESTER BURGE, WAS IN THE HOSPITAL HAVING HAD DOUBLE HERNIA SURGERY TWO DAYS EARLIER. NOW, I'M SURE YOU KNOW IT'S HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR A PATIENT TO BE RELEASED SO SOON AFTER A SURGERY. THE LAST THING A GRIEVING WIDOWER NEEDS IS TO RUPTURE HIS STITCHES. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? WHAT ARE ALL THESE FOOLS DOING IN MY HOUSE? I WANT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU OUT OF HERE THIS MINUTE. BUT THAT WAS CHESTER BURGE FOR YA. HE WAS ONE OF THOSE CHARACTERS I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT. HE GOT WHAT HE WANTED. AND HE WASN'T CONCERNED ABOUT RUFFLING FEATHERS ALONG THE WAY. I WANT TO TALK TO THE PERSON IN CHARGE HERE. AND I WANT EVERY ONE OF YOU PEOPLE OUT OF MY HOUSE THIS INSTANT. SO WHEN THE MATTER CONCERNED HIS BELOVED WIFE, HE CERTAINLY WASN'T GONNA TONE HIMSELF DOWN. I -- I THINK I FEEL FAINT. MR. BURGE, SIT HERE. OUR CONDOLENCES FOR YOUR LOSS, MR. BURGE. IF YOU COULD ANSWER JUST A FEW QUESTIONS FOR US. NOW, DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DISTURBED? MARY'S VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT HOW SHE KEEPS HER BEDROOM. NOTHING STANDS OUT TO ME. IN THE UPPER CLASS, IT'S NOT UNUSUAL IN 1960 FOR A HUSBAND AND WIFE TO HAVE SEPARATE BEDROOMS. IT SHOWS THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT'S IN THAT CLOSET? THAT'S WHERE WE KEEP OUR VALUABLES. THIS NECKLACE LOOKS RAVISHING ON YOU, DARLING. THANK YOU, IT IS BEAUTIFUL. NOW, CHESTER, BEHAVE TONIGHT. THE MAYOR IS GOING TO BE HERE. OF COURSE, DARLING, OF COURSE. HE IS TOLD BY THE POLICE OFFICERS THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A ROBBERY. AND THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT MIGHT'VE BEEN TAKEN. IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING IS INTACT. I ASSUME YOU FOUND THE WALLET. WHAT WALLET? UNDER THE MATTRESS, USUALLY. NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT AT ALL. THERE SHOULD BE $5,000 CASH, RIGHT THERE. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO HAVE LYING AROUND. NOT FOR US. YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN ABOUT LARGER THAN LIFE? CHESTER BURGE HAD MONEY AND PERSONALITY. AND HE HAD BOTH IN EXCESS. SO IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE BURGES SOCIALLY, I CAN SEE HOW THEY MIGHT STRIKE YOU AS ODD. BUT AS FOR MYSELF, I WAS USED TO IT. HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR SELLING ME THAT CADILLAC. MR. GILBERT, IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. IT IS A PLEASURE, MA'AM. AND MAY I PRESENT MY WIFE, MYRTLE. CHESTER AND MARY WERE WHAT SOME DOWN HERE MIGHT UNKINDLY CALL NOUVEAU RICHE. THEIR MONEY WAS NEW, NOT INHERITED, JUST LIKE MINE. BUT THEY MADE A POINT OF THROWING LAVISH PARTIES AND INVITING MACON'S SOCIAL ELITE. I'M AFRAID CHESTER'S OSTENTATIOUS MANNERS MADE IT EASY FOR SOME TO DECLINE THE INVITATION. BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO DID BUSINESS WITH THE MAN, WELL, THE ANNUAL BURGE CHRISTMAS PARTY WAS ALL BUT MANDATORY. CHESTER AND MARY GOT MARRIED IN 1924. SHE WAS FROM A MODEST FARMING FAMILY THE NEXT COUNTY OVER, IN TWIGGS COUNTY. SHE WAS ONE OF 10 SIBLINGS. HE HAD BEEN A PLUMBER'S SON. I THINK HE WANTED SOMETHING BETTER. AND SO HE WAS A BIT AMBITIOUS. THEY HOST A NUMBER OF LAVISH PARTIES. THEY BEGAN PURCHASING REAL ESTATE TO BECOME MOGULS. THEY REALLY BEGIN CAMPAIGNING FOR ENTRANCE INTO GEORGIA ARISTOCRACY. THE BURGES WEREN'T KNOWN FOR THEIR LIGHT TOUCH. THE PORTRAITS ON THE WALLS WEREN'T OF CHESTER'S ANCESTORS. EVEN THE MONOGRAM ON THE CHINA HAD SOMEONE ELSE'S INITIALS. AND YOU HAD TO HAND IT TO THE MAN, HE HAD NO SHAME. THERE'S A VERY DISTINCT DIFFERENCE IN THE SOUTH BETWEEN NEW MONEY AND OLD MONEY. NEW MONEY IS ALMOST FROWNED UPON. YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT YOU DESERVE ACCESS TO HIGH SOCIETY. THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE TAKING PICTURES. AND THAT FLASH FROM THE CAMERA REFLECTS AND FROM SOMETHING DOWN ON THE FLOOR. THEY PICK UP THE 10-KARAT DIAMOND. SO, IN FACT, THE STONE HAD NOT BEEN STOLEN. BUT IT HAD BEEN LOOSENED SO MUCH FROM THE RING DURING THE STRUGGLE THAT IT HAD FALLEN ON THE FLOOR. IF I HAD BECOME A DETECTIVE INSTEAD OF GOING INTO SALES, I THINK ROBBERY WOULD'VE BEEN MY FIRST THOUGHT, TOO. BUT THE CLUES JUST WEREN'T STACKING UP THAT WAY. AND ANY EXPERIENCED DETECTIVE KNOWS THAT WHEN A WIFE IS MURDERED, YOU BETTER DOUBLE-CHECK WHERE HER HUSBAND WAS. CAN YOU CONFIRM FOR US THAT MR. BURGE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL LAST NIGHT? WHY, YES, HE'S BEEN RECOVERING FROM A HERNIA OPERATION. I CHECKED IN ON HIM RIGHT BEFORE MY SHIFT ENDED. AND THERE'S NO WAY HE COULD'VE LEFT THE HOSPITAL AFTERWARDS? NOT WITHOUT RUPTURING HIS INCISION, HE COULDN'T. INVESTIGATORS DETERMINE THAT CHESTER ISN'T THE KILLER BECAUSE HE WAS, INDEED, IN THE HOSPITAL FOR A HERNIA SURGERY. BUT IN SHIRLEY HILLS, A SCANDAL WASN'T EASILY FORGOTTEN. AND THE UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCES OF MARY BURGE'S DEATH RECALLED A SINISTER EVENT THAT HAD GRACED OUR LAWNS ONLY A FEW WEEKS EARLIER. THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT I SUDDENLY RECALL. A FEW WEEKS AGO... ...THEY CAME. AND THEY WERE STIRRED UP LIKE A HORNET'S NEST. THOSE HORROR STORIES YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE SOUTH BACK THEN, WE'D ALL DO WELL TO REMEMBER THOSE WEREN'T JUST STORIES. NOW, AS FAR AS THE SOUTH GOES, MACON WAS AS LIBERAL AS IT COULD GET IN 1960. BUT WHEN A WEALTHY WHITE WOMAN IS STRANGLED IN A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD, FOLKS CAN'T HELP BUT TURN THEIR MINDS TO OTHER RECENT UNPLEASANTRIES. LIGHTS, COSTUMES, PROPS, WHETHER IT WAS A PARTY OR A PROTEST, DAY OR NIGHT, FOLKS IN MACON KNEW HOW TO PUT ON A SHOW. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, FOR ALL HIS ECCENTRICITIES, ROBERT LEE DAVIDSON WAS DANGEROUS. WHAT IS GOING ON OUT HERE? TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE MURDER, MEMBERS OF THE KU KLUX KLAN ARRIVED AT THE BURGES' HOME. AND YOU KNOW THAT CARL QUICKSTREET IS IN A WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND YOU'RE STILL RENTING THAT HOUSE OUT TO THEM NEGROES. FIRSTLY, MR. DAVIDSON, LOWER THE VOLUME OF YOUR VOICE. THIS PROTEST WAS MOTIVATED BY ANGER THAT BURGE WAS LEASING PROPERTIES TO BLACKS IN WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS. I DO NOT SEE WHY ALL OF THIS IS NECESSARY. WE CANNOT LEAVE THAT RENTAL PROPERTY SITTING EMPTY. WE WANT THEM GONE, MRS. BURGE. YOU AND YOUR CARNIVAL OF IMBECILES ARE TRESPASSING ON MY PROPERTY. I OUGHT TO JUST BLOW YOUR HEAD RIGHT OFF. CHESTER, PUT THAT FOOL THING DOWN. THEM NEGROES ARE A BLIGHT UPON OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS IS PURELY A BUSINESS DECISION. YOU FIX IT OR WE WILL BE BACK. AND SO DETECTIVES THOUGHT, "WELL, PERHAPS THIS MURDER ISN'T ROBBERY. MAYBE IT'S TIED, IN SOME WAY, TO THE KLAN." MR. DAVIDSON, YOU HAVE COMPANY. LET 'EM THROUGH, BOBBY. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS RALLY AT THE CALL OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEADER, FIDEL CASTRO, WHO ESTIMATED THAT A NUMBER... THE POLICE, OF COURSE, KNOW THE KU KLUX KLAN VERY WELL. - WELL, HAVE A SEAT. - IT'S SAD TO SAY. BUT AT THE TIME, THE GRAND DRAGON OF THE KU KLUX KLAN WAS CERTAINLY RESPECTED IN THE COMMUNITY. WHAT CAN I DO YOU FOR? YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE. YOU ARE HERE ABOUT MARY, AREN'T YOU? WE HEARD YOU PAID 'EM A VISIT. WELL, WE SURE DID. THEY WERE DISGRACING OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. SO YOU DECIDED TO TAKE JUSTICE INTO YOUR OWN HANDS? I'M SURPRISED AT YOU, DETECTIVE. MR. BURGE DID EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED. AND HE EVICTED THEM NEGROES. AND HE SAID, "THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US. WE DIDN'T DO IT." BUT THEM NEGROES, WELL, THEY SURE WAS ANGRY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. IF FOLLOWING A LEAD FROM THE GRAND DRAGON OF THE KKK TOWARDS A GROUP OF IMPOVERISHED BLACK TENANTS SEEMS LIKE A TURN A FEW DEGREES TOO STEEP, WELL, THAT'S JUST HOW THE SOUTH WAS BACK THEN. AND THERE WAS NO DENYING CHESTER HAD SUPPLIED THESE FOLKS WITH PLENTY OF MOTIVE. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, CHESTER MADE HIS FORTUNE SELLING PROPERTIES AND FINANCING LOANS. AND WHEN WE HEARD WHAT HE'D BEEN DOING EVEN BEFORE THE EVICTIONS, WELL, I WOULD'VE BEEN ANGRY, TOO. CHESTER WOULD SELL TO UNSUSPECTING WHITES AND BLACKS WITH A REVERSIONARY CLAUSE. AND WHAT THAT MEANT WAS, IF YOU MISSED EVEN ONE PAYMENT, I GET THE HOUSE BACK. AND YOU GET NOTHING AT ALL FOR IT. AND SO THE POLICE GO OUT AND ROUND UP SEVERAL BLACKS WHO FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST HIM. THEY ARRESTED THEM ON WHAT THEY CALLED OPEN CHARGES, WHICH MEANT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO INDICT THEM ON ANYTHING AND HELD THEM IN JAIL. BURGE IS A EVIL MAN. HE KICKED ME AND MY WIFE OUT. EVERYTHING I HAD, I PUT INTO THAT HOME. THE POLICE BEGIN TO SUSPECT THAT MARY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE ACTUAL TARGET. AND THAT CHESTER WAS ACTUALLY THE TARGET. THE POLICE THINK THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY OUT THERE WHO'S SO ANGRY THAT HE HAS TAKEN THEIR HOUSE THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET EVEN. BUT THERE'S JUST NO EVIDENCE. THEY HAD NOT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. A WEEK AFTER THE MURDER, THE FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS CAME BACK FROM THE STATE CRIME LAB. THEY FOUND, REALLY, NOTHING OF INTEREST. THE FINGERPRINTS ON THE DOOR CAME BACK TO CHESTER BURGE. WELL, IT'S HIS HOME. AT THIS POINT, THE POLICE ARE THINKING, "WHO ELSE MUST'VE KNOWN THE HOUSE?" YOU KNOW, HER WATCH-DOG PARROT DIED HOURS BEFORE SHE DID. THE MISSING CASH IS KEPT IN A VERY SPECIFIC HIDING PLACE. THE OFFICERS COME AROUND TO THE IDEA THAT THERE WAS AN INSIDER INVOLVED. SOMEONE, PERHAPS, WITH A KEY. THEY ARREST JESSIMAE, THE HOUSEKEEPER. AND THEY ARREST LEWIS JOHNSON, THE CHAUFFEUR, WHO POLICE DISCOVER HAD CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS. CAN YOU TELL US WHERE YOU WERE ON THE NIGHT OF MAY 11th? I WAS HOME. GOT THERE AROUND 10:00 OR SO. WENT HOME. GOT THERE AROUND 10:00, WENT TO BED WITH MY WIFE. HAD A LITTLE SIP OF SOMETHING AND WENT STRAIGHT TO BED. I WOKE UP, AROUND QUARTER TO MIDNIGHT. AT ABOUT MIDNIGHT... I WENT TO JESSIMAE'S. LEWIS CAME OVER. HE WOKE ME UP. HOW LONG WAS HE THERE? HE STAYED ALL NIGHT. I STAYED THERE ALL NIGHT. ALL NIGHT. I STAYED THERE ALL NIGHT. LEWIS AND JESSIMAE HAVE IDENTICAL STORIES. EITHER THEY'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD LIE ORGANIZED OR THEY'RE TELLING THE TRUTH AND IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MARY'S MURDER. BUT IT'S OBVIOUS TO THE OFFICERS THAT, THEY'RE NOT, BEING ENTIRELY FORTHCOMING. COME ON, LEWIS. YOU THOUGHT THAT $5,000 FROM MRS. BURGE'S WALLET WOULD SET YOU UP REAL NICE. I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT, SIR. BET YOU WANTED THAT DIAMOND RING SO BADLY. I DON'T CARE 'BOUT NO DIAMOND. I JUST WISH MISS MARY WAS STILL ALIVE. SHE PUT UP WITH SO MUCH. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SHE PUT UP WITH SO MUCH? NOTHING, SIR. THEN WHY'D YOU SAY IT? DON'T KNOW. WELL, IN THE SOUTH, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN A HOUSEHOLD, YOU ASK THE SERVANTS BECAUSE THEY KNOW EVERYTHING. IT WOULDN'T BE MY PLACE TO DISCUSS PRIVATE MATTERS. WHAT HAPPENS IN A MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE. COME ON, NOW. MR. BURGE... ALWAYS HAD A CERTAIN QUALITY. AND HE HAD A FRIEND. AND WHAT WAS HER NAME? A YOUNG MAN... HE TOOK A SHINE ON. MRS. BURGE WASN'T TOO KEEN ON. THIS YOUNG MAN WAS PRESENT AT EVERY PARTY OF CHESTER'S I ATTENDED. AND HAVING A BIT OF A NOSE FOR THESE THINGS, I SMELLED TROUBLE FROM THE BEGINNING. JEALOUS LOVERS ARE CAPABLE OF DOING EXTREME THINGS. YOU KNOW HOW THINGS ARE AT THESE PARTIES. EVERYONE'S ALL DRESSED UP. IT'S DARK. THE MUSIC IS PLAYING AND THE CHAMPAGNE IS FLOWING. THE DETECTIVES WONDERED IF MAYBE IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THIS YOUNG MAN TO STAND BY AND WATCH HIS PARAMOUR DANCE WITH SOMEONE ELSE. THE POLICE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO A LOT OF DIGGING TO FIND OUT WHO THIS YOUNG MAN WAS. HE'D BEEN DOWN SEVERAL TIMES. QUITE A FEW PEOPLE HAD MET HIM. HIS NAME WAS FRITZ PHILLIPS. HE LIVED IN NEW JERSEY. ON MAY 22nd, 10 DAYS AFTER THE MURDER, THE POLICE FLY TO NEW JERSEY TO MEET THEIR NEW SUSPECT. EXPLAIN TO US THE NATURE OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. BURGE. DETECTIVE, I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE THE NATURE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP. THEY KNOW THAT HE'S GAY. HE, IN TURN, KNOWS THAT THEY KNOW THAT HE'S GAY. HOW DID YOU MEET MR. BURGE? MY GREAT-AUNT MAY AND UNCLE NU HAD BEEN AROUND BUYING MORTGAGES IN GEORGIA. THEY WERE FRIENDLY WITH CHESTER. AND ONE TIME THEY ASKED IF I WOULD DRIVE MRS. AND MR. BURGE BACK TO MACON AFTER THEY HAD FINISHED BUSINESS HERE IN JERSEY. TELL ME MORE ABOUT WHERE YOU WENT TO SCHOOL, FRITZ. I, UM, SERVED AT CORNELL AND MOVED ON TO PRINCETON. WONDERFUL SCHOOLING. AND THAT'S WHEN WE BECAME ACQUAINTED. CHESTER IS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN WITH FRITZ. HE'S A PERSON FROM A FAMILY OF WEALTH. HIS FAMILY GOES BACK TO THE MAYFLOWER. ** AND SO, ON THE, TRIP, CHESTER AND FRITZ HAVE ORAL SEX WITH ONE ANOTHER, EVEN AS MARY IS, THEIR TRAVELING COMPANION. FRITZ GOES BACK TO NEW JERSEY THE NEXT DAY. AND CHESTER CANNOT GET FRITZ OFF OF HIS MIND. SO HE CONTINUES TO FLY FRITZ DOWN TO MACON FROM TIME TO TIME. FRITZ DID NOT STAY IN THE GUEST BEDROOM. HE STAYED IN THE MASTER BEDROOM WITH THE MASTER. WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH MARY BURGE? WE WERE CORDIAL. I MEAN, I ASSUME IT MUST'VE BOTHERED HER. BUT THAT WASN'T MY RESPONSIBILITY. SHE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON? SHE WASN'T OPPOSED TO IT AS LONG AS NO ONE ELSE IN MACON KNEW ABOUT IT. CHESTER AND MARY'S MARRIAGE WAS A BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT THAT ALLOWED THEM TO ACCESS HIGH SOCIETY. IF YOU WANTED TO GO TO THE RIGHT COUNTRY CLUBS, YOU HAD TO BE MARRIED. SHE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN HER SOCIAL STATUS. AND SHE CAN'T DO THAT IF EVERYBODY IN MACON KNOWS ABOUT CHESTER'S SEXUAL PROCLIVITIES. MARY WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE CONCERNED. SHE HAD KNOWN FOR YEARS ABOUT THE FACT THAT CHESTER WAS HAVING SEX WITH MEN. BUT IT WAS ALMOST ALWAYS OUT OF TOWN. HERE WAS FRITZ, IN MACON, WHERE PEOPLE COULD SEE. I THINK YOU WERE HANGING AROUND HOPING CHESTER WOULD LEAVE MARY. AND WHEN HE DIDN'T, YOU GOT JEALOUS. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. MY TIME WITH CHESTER WAS JUST A DIVERSION. SO WHERE WERE YOU THE NIGHT OF MAY 11th? I WAS HERE, IN NEW JERSEY. THAT'S THE FACT OF IT. AND FRITZ WAS ABLE TO HAVE THAT CORROBORATED BY OTHER PEOPLE. CHESTER HAD BEEN PURSUING EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES LONG BEFORE I CAME AROUND. CAN YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT MR. BURGE'S EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES? WELL, I WOULDN'T KNOW. BUT YOU MIGHT TRY TALKING TO HIS CHAUFFEUR. IF THE DETECTIVES WERE FRUSTRATED TO HEAR THAT LEWIS KNEW MORE THAN HE'D LET ON, THEY PROBABLY WEREN'T SURPRISED. YOU LEARN A LOT ABOUT A PERSON DRIVING THEM AROUND ALL DAY. LEWIS MAY HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED AS A CHAUFFEUR, BUT IT WAS HIS JOB TO KEEP QUIET. WHO WAS MR. BURGE INVOLVED WITH? I CAN TELL YA PLENTY CHESTER DONE. WHAT BOTHERED ME IS WHAT HE WANTED TO DO WITH THAT BOY. BOY WAS TOO YOUNG FOR THAT. HOW YOU DOING THERE, TOMMY? PRETTY GOOD, SIR. HOW 'BOUT YOU? FINE, THANKS. DO YOU GOT ANY PLANS YET FOR NEXT SUMMER? NONE SO FAR. CHESTER HAS MET A YOUNG HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR, WHO WORKS AT THE SERVICE STATION WHERE HE TAKES HIS CADILLAC. HE DECIDES THAT HE'S GOING TO TAKE THIS YOUNG BOY OFF TO EUROPE FOR THE SUMMER. HE WENT TO SEE THIS BOY'S PARENTS SAYING, "HE'LL NEVER HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY AGAIN. WE'LL HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME. PLUS, I'M GOING TO PAY HIM." AND WHEN MRS. BURGE FOUND OUT, THINGS WEREN'T THE SAME NO MORE. ARE YOU TRYING TO DRAG US THROUGH THE MUD, CHESTER? HOW STUPID ARE YOU? WHAT'S THE BEE IN YOUR BONNET NOW? LORD, CHESTER, HOW OLD IS HE, 16? IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY TO START EXPANDING YOUR HORIZONS, SEE THE WORLD! WHAT MADE THIS TIME DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER? I'VE SAID IT ONCE AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN. APPEARANCES WERE EVERYTHING TO US. SO LONG AS CHESTER WAS OUT OF TOWN, HE WAS FREE TO DO AS HE PLEASED. BUT WE ALL SAW THIS BOY AT THE SERVICE STATION. IT WAS LITERALLY TOO CLOSE TO HOME. I MADE ARRANGEMENTS. AND I UNMADE THEM. MARY IMMEDIATELY PUTS AN END TO IT. CHESTER WAS ABSOLUTELY LIVID. AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED, MARY SHOULD HAVE STAYED OUT OF IT. THE POLICE HAVE TO WONDER, "WAS HE FURIOUS ENOUGH TO HARM HER?" IT SEEMED INCREDIBLE. AFTER ALL, THE POLICE HAD CONFIRMED CHESTER WAS IN THE HOSPITAL WHILE THE MURDER HAPPENED. THEY'D SEEN HIM WHEN HE WAS CARRIED INTO THE CRIME SCENE WITH THEIR OWN EYES. THE MAN WAS STILL RECOVERING FROM THAT SURGERY, EVEN WEEKS LATER. HEY, MR. BURGE. HOW YOU FEELING TODAY? AS WELL AS CAN BE EXPECTED. BUT THE CLUES WERE STARTING TO STACK UP. AND THEY WEREN'T IN CHESTER'S FAVOR. SO YOU WERE HERE ON THE NIGHT OF MAY 11th? YES. AND I ASSUME YOU CHECKED ON MR. BURGE? I GAVE HIM A DOUBLE DOSE OF SEDATIVES. AND HE WENT TO BED SOON AFTER. AND THERE'S NO WAY FOR MR. BURGE TO HAVE LEFT THIS HOSPITAL WITHOUT BEING SEEN? WELL, I COULDN'T SAY FOR SURE. WE DID HAVE A SHIFT CHANGE. AND THERE CAN BE A BIT OF A BREAK IN BETWEEN. YOU NOTICE ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY THAT NIGHT? WELL, THERE WERE TWO MEN. THE NURSE NOTICED TWO MALE VISITORS, ONE BLACK AND ONE WHITE, COME INTO THE HOSPITAL ROOM AFTER NORMAL VISITING HOURS. CAN YOU DESCRIBE THEM? I'M AFRAID I DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN A PERSON ISN'T FORTHCOMING? WELL, YOU FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL BE. POLICE BRING FRITZ DOWN TO MACON TO AID IN THE INVESTIGATION. I'M JUST GONNA CUT RIGHT TO IT. WE NEED YOUR HELP. WE'RE LOOKING AT CHESTER. AND WE THINK IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO KNOWS WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON BETWEEN HIM AND MARY, IT'D BE YOU. WELL, I'VE HAD MY MISGIVINGS, TOO, ON THAT ACCOUNT, ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS. FRITZ WAS VERY FORTHCOMING. HE TOLD THEM THAT IN JANUARY, JUST FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE MURDER, HE AND CHESTER WENT DOWN TO NORTH FLORIDA. AND THEY FOUND A SMALL HOTEL, WHICH CHESTER WAS GOING TO BUY. AND FRITZ WAS GOING TO RUN. AND THEY WOULD LIVE THERE TOGETHER IN COMPLETE BLISS. ON THAT SAME TRIP TO LOOK AT THE HOTELS, THEY STOP OFF AND VISIT CHESTER'S COUSINS, THE KYLES, WHO LIVE DOWN THERE. AND DURING THAT TIME, CHESTER CONFESSES TO THE KYLES THAT HE IS IN LOVE WITH FRITZ AND WANTS TO SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE WITH FRITZ. HE WAS GOING TO LEAVE MARY. LISTEN, A LOT OF MEN WENT THROUGH THIS BACK THEN. I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF 'EM. BUT I KNEW VERY WELL WHAT CHESTER SHOULD'VE KNOWN, TOO. JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE READY TO LIVE YOUR DREAM DOESN'T MEAN OTHER PEOPLE ARE READY TO BE A PART OF THE PLAN. MARY GETS WORD OF THIS. AND SHE'S FURIOUS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE BARGAIN. IF, IN FACT, HE WAS GOING TO HAVE HIS FREEDOM, IT WAS ALWAYS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY KEEP TOGETHER THAT FACADE OF THEIR MARRIAGE. - HOW ARE YOU, MARY? - CHESTER, WE NEED TO TALK. SHE'S VERY UPSET. SHE'S VERY HURT. MARY NEEDS CHESTER TO MAINTAIN HER LIFESTYLE. CHESTER, YOU ARE SICK. YOU HAVE AN ILLNESS. AND YOU NEED HELP. AND, MARY DECIDES THAT THINGS CANNOT GO ON THE WAY THEY ARE. I HAVE BEEN DOING SOME READING. AND THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CASES THAT HAVE BEEN TREATED EXCELLENTLY WITH A LOBOTOMY. ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR COTTON-PICKING MIND? AND SO MARY DECIDES THAT WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS TO HAVE THIS HOMOSEXUALITY CUT OUT OF THEIR LIFE, WHICH MEANS CUTTING IT OUT OF CHESTER'S. BACK THEN, PEOPLE THOUGHT HOMOSEXUALITY WAS AN ILLNESS. I WENT IN FOR TREATMENT MYSELF, ONCE OR TWICE. MY FAMILY WAS CONCERNED. BUT THAT WAS JUST HOW THINGS WERE DONE. I'VE MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR YOU TO SEE A DR. THIGPEN. YOU'VE MADE ARRANGEMENTS? THOUGH IT MAY SEEM HATEFUL TO US NOW, AT THE TIME, MARY WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP. SO CHESTER AND FRITZ, THEY'RE BOTH EVALUATED. AND DR. THIGPEN TELLS CHESTER THAT A LOBOTOMY, OF COURSE, WOULD NOT WORK. THEN DR. THIGPEN FINALLY SAYS, "NO, WHAT NEEDS TO BE CUT OUT IS FRITZ." HE WOULD JUST REMOVE HIMSELF FROM THE EQUATION AND AGREE NOT TO SEE CHESTER ANYMORE, THAT EVERYTHING COULD GO BACK TO NORMAL IN CHESTER'S LIFE. SO DID YOU LEAVE? OF COURSE I DID. WHAT CHESTER AND I HAD, IT WASN'T SERIOUS, AT LEAST NOT TO ME. SO FRITZ AGREES TO THIS. EVEN MARY GIVES HIM A KISS ON THE CHEEK GOODBYE. BUT THAT'S IT. IT'S GOODBYE. HE IS TO LEAVE. HE IS NEVER TO COME BACK TO MACON. AND HE AND CHESTER ARE NEVER TO HAVE CONTACT AGAIN. THE POLICE THINK THAT MARY'S INTERRUPTING CHESTER'S ROMANTIC PLANS HAS SET CHESTER OFF. IT'S LIKE THREE STRIKES AND YOU'RE OUT. FIRST STRIKE WAS INTERFERING WITH CHESTER'S NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT. SECOND STRIKE WAS, MARY INTERFERED WITH CHESTER AND FRITZ'S PLANS TO BUY THE HOTEL IN FLORIDA. THE THIRD STRIKE WAS SENDING FRITZ BACK TO NEW JERSEY, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN BY CHESTER. THE OFFICERS FELT LIKE THEY HAD A MOTIVE FOR CHESTER. WITH MARY OUT OF THE WAY, CHESTER COULD DO WHAT HE WANTED TO DO. BUT ONE THOUGHT EMERGES. WHY WOULD HE HAVE TO KILL HER? WHY COULDN'T HE JUST HAVE A DIVORCE? LOVE CAN MAKE A PERSON DO CRAZY THINGS SOMETIMES. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE FORCED TO HIDE WHO YOU REALLY ARE. BUT THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE SECRET HIDING IN THE BURGES' CLOSET. WHAT'S THAT THEY SAY ABOUT UNHAPPY FAMILIES? THEY MAY ALL BE UNHAPPY IN THEIR OWN WAY. BUT AT THE TIME, THERE WERE FAMILIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY LIVING IN ARRANGEMENTS LIKE THIS ONE. MARRIAGES THAT WERE A LITTLE CURLY AROUND THE EDGES, AS WE USED TO SAY. BUT CHESTER WASN'T SATISFIED WITH THAT. A LESS THAN IDEAL FAMILY SITUATION ISN'T A MOTIVE FOR MURDER, HOWEVER. SO WHEN THE PIECES DON'T ADD UP, WELL, THAT USUALLY MEANS THAT A PIECE IS MISSING. WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR POLICE TO LOOK INTO HIS BACKGROUND, THERE IN THE LEGAL FILES WAS A DOCUMENT. AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS, WHEN CHESTER WAS A YOUNG MAN, HE HAD BEEN DECLARED INSANE. HIS MOTHER HAD ACTUALLY COMMITTED HIM TO THE INSANE ASYLUM. LIKELY BECAUSE HE WAS A HOMOSEXUAL. ALL THESE DEEDS ARE MADE OUT TO MARY BURGE. UNDER THE LAW, IF YOU'RE INSANE, YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS, TO BUY AND SELL PROPERTY IN YOUR OWN NAME. SO IN ALL THOSE YEARS, EVERYTHING HAD BEEN PUT IN MARY'S NAME. SHE OWNED THE HOUSES. SHE OWNED THE JEWELRY. MARY OWNED EVERYTHING. IN 1960, IT WOULD'VE BEEN UNHEARD OF FOR THE WIFE TO PAY THE HUSBAND ALIMONY. SO DIVORCE WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED FOR CHESTER. IF MARY LIVED, SHE CONTROLLED THAT MONEY. IF SHE DIED, HE HAD ABOUT A HALF-MILLION DOLLARS. MONEY MADE MARY HAPPY. AND THERE WAS A LOT OF IT. AND AS LONG AS MARY CONTROLLED THAT MONEY, THERE WAS NO HOTEL IN FLORIDA WITH FRITZ, NO EUROPEAN VOYAGES WITH YOUNG TRAVELING COMPANIONS. ULTIMATELY, THAT WAS CHESTER'S PROBLEM. CHESTER STRUCK A DEAL WITH MARY. AND THEN, HE CHANGED HIS MIND. CHESTER DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A DEAL. CHESTER WANTED EVERYTHING. ON MAY 31st, ALMOST 3 WEEKS AFTER THE MURDER, CHESTER IS FORMALLY CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF HIS WIFE. CHESTER'S TRIAL, THAT STARTED IN NOVEMBER, OF 1960 WAS THE BIGGEST THING TO HIT MACON IN MANY, MANY YEARS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MEMBERS OF THE JURY, THE DEFENSE WILL CLAIM THAT CHESTER BURGE WAS AN INVALID AT THE TIME OF HIS WIFE'S MURDER. BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, CHESTER BURGE IS NO INVALID. HE IS NO STRANGER TO DECEIT AND LIES. WHAT THE PROSECUTION WAS CLAIMING IS THAT CHESTER WAS SAVVY ENOUGH TO GET UP AT THE HOSPITAL, GO DOWN THE HALL, GET DOWNSTAIRS AND GO HOME. HE CHOKES HER WITH HIS OWN HANDS. AND THEN HE TRIES TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A ROBBERY BY HAMMERING SOME PINS OUT OF THE LOCKED CLOSET DOOR. AND THEN HE LIED ABOUT THE MISSING MONEY TO THE POLICE. AND COME BACK AND GET INTO HIS HOSPITAL BED UNSEEN. HE MADE ONLY ONE CRUCIAL MISTAKE IN KNOCKING THE PINS ON THE CLOSET DOOR. HE LEFT BEHIND A FINGERPRINT. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING BECAUSE I HAD THE SAME THOUGHT WHEN I READ IT IN THE PAPERS. THE FINGERPRINT, A CLUE SO INSIGNIFICANT, THEY'D ALL BUT THROWN IT AWAY. BUT SOMETIMES IT'S NOT WHERE YOU LEAVE A FINGERPRINT, IT'S WHEN. IS IT YOUR JOB TO CLEAN MRS. BURGE'S BEDROOM? YES, SIR. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU CLEANED IT? THE WEDNESDAY, SIR. THE WEDNESDAY MRS. BURGE WAS KILLED? YES, SIR. AND THE REASON THAT IT'S IMPORTANT, ACCORDING TO THEM, IS THAT, SINCE CHESTER WAS IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN THE DOOR WAS WASHED AND THE FINGERPRINT IS THERE, CHESTER CAME HOME THAT NIGHT. MAYBE THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE FAR-FETCHED. BUT FINGERPRINT OR NO FINGERPRINT, CHESTER SEEMED HEADED FOR PRISON. HE WAS MEAN AND HE WAS HOMOSEXUAL AND THE JURY DIDN'T LIKE EITHER OF THOSE THINGS. WHEN CHARLES ADAMS TOOK THE FLOOR, HOWEVER, HE DID SOMETHING WE NEVER DO DOWN HERE. HE SAID EXACTLY WHAT EVERYONE WAS ALREADY THINKING. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, MR. BURGE IS ARROGANT. YOU WON'T LIKE HIM. HE'S NOT A NICE PERSON. IN FACT, HE'S DESPICABLE. HE'S GUILTY OF LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS, HE'S ON TRIAL FOR MURDER. AND THAT'S ALL HE'S ON TRIAL FOR. THEY FOUND A FINGERPRINT ON A CLOSET. SO WHAT? IT'S HIS HOUSE. YES, YOU FOUND THE MAN'S FINGERPRINT. SURELY, YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE. - DR. HATCHER... - YES? WOULD YOU BE SO KIND AS TO EXPLAIN TO THE JURY THE MEDICAL CONDITION OF MR. BURGE? MR. BURGE WAS RECOVERING FROM A HERNIA OPERATION. THE DEFENSE WAS CLAIMING THAT CHESTER HAD HAD THIS OPERATION, A DOUBLE DOSE OF SEDATIVES AND A SLEEPING PILL. TO HAVE GONE HOME AND DONE ALL THIS WOULD'VE BEEN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE WITH THAT HUGE GASH. WHAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE TODAY IS WHETHER WE GAMBLE WITH THIS MAN'S LIFE. AFTER A TOTAL OF ONLY ABOUT SIX HOURS OF DELIBERATION... HAS THE JURY REACHED A DECISION? YES, YOUR HONOR. WE, THE JURY, IN THIS MATTER HEREBY FIND THE DEFENDANT, ONE CHESTER BURGE, NOT GUILTY. SEVERAL OF THE JURORS LATER SAID, "WE THOUGHT HE HAD SOMEONE MURDER HER. BUT WE WERE ASKED TO JUDGE WHETHER HE PERSONALLY WENT HOME AND MURDERED HIS WIFE. AND WE THINK HE DID NOT." THE JURY KNEW CHESTER WAS A HOMOSEXUAL. BUT THEY HAD PLENTY OF REASONABLE DOUBT. AND SO THEY DID THEIR DUTY AND ACQUITTED HIM. IT COULD'VE FELT LIKE A VICTORY, IF ONLY FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME. SO WHY DIDN'T I FEEL THAT WAY? AFTER YEARS OF LOOKING AT IT, INVESTIGATING IT, TALKING TO PEOPLE, I THINK THAT THERE WERE TWO VISITORS TO HIS HOSPITAL ROOM THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER. MY BEST GUESS IS THAT HE PROBABLY PAID THOSE MEN TO HAVE HIS WIFE MURDERED. BUT ALL WE CAN DO IS GUESS BECAUSE THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS THE END OF THIS STORY ISN'T AROUND TO TELL IT. THIS PARTICULAR STORY IS SUCH A BIZARRE ONE THAT, IF WE TRIED TO WRITE IT AS FICTION, NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE IT. OFTENTIMES, PEOPLE IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS ARE DRIVEN TO DO BAD THINGS. SOMETIMES, EVEN YOU OR I MIGHT FEEL WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. THE PAIN OF BEING TRAPPED IN A LOVELESS MARRIAGE OR HAVING TO HIDE WHO YOU ARE CAN DRIVE A PERSON TO A VERY DARK PLACE. IT'S EASY TO BE A GOOD MAN WHEN EVERYTHING IS GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN. BUT LIFE IS FULL OF IMPOSSIBLE DREAMS AND THWARTED HOPES. AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY A GOOD MAN IS SO VERY HARD TO FIND. * BY THE LIGHT OF THE SILVERY MOON * * I WANT TO SPOON * * TO MY HONEY, I'LL CROON LOVE'S TUNE * * YOUR SILVERY BEAMS WILL BRING LOVE'S DREAMS * * WE'LL BE CUDDLIN' SOON * * BY THE SILVERY MOON *
