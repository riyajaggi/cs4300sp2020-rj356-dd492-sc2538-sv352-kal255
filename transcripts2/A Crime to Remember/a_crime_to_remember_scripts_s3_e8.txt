 AND THERE WAS NO ANSWER AT ALL, A TINGE OF FEAR RAN THROUGH MRS. WILLIAMS. IT LED HER OUT OF HER KITCHEN AND THROUGH THE BACKYARD TO TRY THE OTHER DOOR THAT OPENED INTO BETTY'S BEDROOM. BUT EVEN SHE COULDN'T HAVE IMAGINED... BETTY? ...THAT WITHIN JUST A FEW SHORT HOURS, BETTY'S EMPTY BED WAS GOING TO TEAR THE SOUL OF ODESSA, TEXAS, CLEAN APART. ** ODESSA, TEXAS, IN THE 1960s WAS THE ULTIMATE OIL BOOM TOWN, AND IT WAS BEDROCK CONSERVATIVE. JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY, REPUBLICAN, AND DEEPLY CHRISTIAN.

 BUT IF THERE WAS ONE THING THAT ODESSANS MIGHT HAVE LOVED MORE THAN GOD, IT COULD'VE BEEN THEIR HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAMS. AS MANY AS 15,000 PEOPLE WOULD COME OUT TO SEE THOSE FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS AT ODESSA HIGH SCHOOL... ...WHERE BETTY SHOULD'VE BEEN THAT MORNING. I'VE CALLED AROUND TO ALL HER FRIENDS, AND NO ONE KNOWS WHERE SHE IS. SO, SHE'S BEEN MISSING HOW LONG NOW? IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWO HOURS SINCE I CHECKED HER ROOM. JUST A COUPLE HOURS? BETTY WILLIAMS' PARENTS TOLD THE POLICE THAT THEIR 17-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER IS MISSING. I UNDERSTAND. IT'S JUST THAT WITH TEENAGERS -- SHE'S 17, YOU SAID? -- THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE SHE'LL TURN UP BACK AT HOME SOON. Y-YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. SOMETHING IS WRONG. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HER? LAST NIGHT. SHE CAME HOME AFTER HER PLAY REHEARSAL. HI, HONEY. DIDN'T HEAR YOU COME IN. SORRY IT'S LATE, MOM. IT'S OKAY. HOW WAS REHEARSAL? LONG. DAD GO TO SLEEP? YEAH, HE DID, COUPLE HOURS AGO. NIGHT, MOM. SHE WOULDN'T GO OFF WITHOUT A WORD. OUR BETTY IS A GOOD CHRISTIAN GIRL. THE WILLIAMS FAMILY WAS EXTREMELY RELIGIOUS. BETTY WAS A VERY GOOD CHRISTIAN GIRL. SHE LOVED TO TEACH CHILDREN. SHE WORKED WITH THE YOUTH GROUP AT THE FRIENDSHIP BAPTIST CHURCH. WHEN THE POLICE HEAR ABOUT A MISSING TEENAGE GIRL, USUALLY YOU WAIT IT OUT 24 HOURS. BETTY HADN'T BEEN MISSING FOR VERY LONG, BUT THE WILLIAMSES WERE HEART-SICK, AND MAYBE IT WAS THE PITCH OF DESPERATION COMING OFF BETTY'S MOTHER THAT FINALLY MOVED THE DETECTIVES TO JUST GO OUT AND ASK A FEW QUESTIONS. THEY WENT TO SPEND A COUPLE HOURS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL, WHERE BETTY'S FRIENDS MIGHT KNOW THINGS HER PARENTS DIDN'T. I WAS SITTING IN FIRST PERIOD, GEOMETRY. AND THE TEACHER SAID, "GAYLE, THEY WANT TO SEE YOU IN THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE." WHEN I ARRIVED AT SCHOOL, RUMORS WERE SPREADING LIKE WILDFIRE THAT BETTY WAS MISSING. WHEN I GOT CALLED IN TO TALK TO THE POLICE THAT MORNING, AS FAR AS I KNEW, BETTY JUST HADN'T SHOWN UP FOR SCHOOL, SO IT WAS MORE LIKE CRAZY GOSSIP. WE NEVER COULD'VE IMAGINED THAT WITHIN A FEW HOURS, WE'D ALL BE LED DOWN A TRAIL INTO A NIGHTMARE. SO... YOU'RE ALL IN DRAMA CLUB WITH BETTY WILLIAMS? YES, WE ARE. ANYONE HEARD FROM BETTY THIS MORNING? SEEN HER ANYWHERE? NO, I MEAN... NO. IS IT LIKE HER TO MISS SCHOOL? NO. NO. AND GAYLE IS...? AND YOU'RE BETTY'S BEST FRIEND? YES, SIR. WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT BETTY? SHE WAS A SENIOR AND I WAS A SOPHOMORE, AND, I JUST THOUGHT SHE WAS SUCH A WISE, WORLDLY PERSON. BETTY LOVED THEATER, DRAMA. AND SHE HAD ALL THE MAGAZINES AND ALL OF THAT. "OUR BEAUTIFUL GROUNDS ARE SOME OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD. NOWHERE WILL YOU FIND SUCH IMMACULATE KEEPING." AND AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, SHE IS PLANNING TO GO TO THEATER SCHOOL AT INDIANA UNIVERSITY. IN LUNCH COUNTERS AND BUS TERMINALS ALL OVER THE SOUTH, THE BATTLE IS JOINED. WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WE COULD GET THE WHOLE DRAMA CLUB TO DO IT. SOMEONE JUST NEEDS TO STAND UP AND TELL THE TRUTH. YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY DID THAT, I BET EVERYONE WOULD LISTEN TO THEM. BETTY WAS VERY BRAVE. I LOVED HER STREAK OF INDEPENDENCE AND HER DEFIANCE. BETTY WILLIAMS SAW HERSELF AS A BEATNIK. IN ODESSA, TEXAS, TRADITIONAL, CONSERVATIVE, EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANITY DOMINATED. COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE ODESSA YOUNG LADY, BETTY WAS A REBEL. OKAY. WHAT ABOUT BOYS? IS THERE A BOY BETTY'S SPENDING TIME WITH? WELL... IT ISN'T A BOY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THERE WERE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT BOYS. SHE WOULD MEET UP WITH GUYS AT TOMMY'S, AFTER CURFEW FOR MOST OF US. ** BETTY HAD A ROOM IN THE HOUSE THAT HAD A BACK DOOR. SHE COULD LEAVE UNSEEN, AND SHE DID ALL THE TIME. ** BETTY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS OKAY TO GO OUT AND EXPRESS YOURSELF SEXUALLY. BUT BETTY WAS ONLY 17 YEARS OLD. ** BETTY HAD SEX, AND SHE LIKED SEX, AND SHE USED THAT TO HER ADVANTAGE. SHE WAS EXPLICIT ABOUT THE FACT THAT, "YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SEX, AREN'T YOU? WELL, I'M THINKING ABOUT SEX, TOO." AND SHE LOVED SEEING THE REACTION. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW SHOCKING THAT WAS IN 1960. * JESUS SO SHE WOULD JUST GET IN CARS WITH BOYS AND JUST GO OFF WITH THEM? YEAH, ALL THE TIME. AND THAT RIGHT THERE, I THINK THAT'S WHEN THE POLICE STARTED TO GET A RING OF BAD FEELING. MAYBE THIS WASN'T JUST A CASE OF OVER-ANXIOUS PARENTS. MAYBE BETTY WENT OFF INTO THE DARK... ...WITH GOD KNOWS WHO, AND NEVER CAME HOME AGAIN. IF BETTY WILLIAMS HAD BEEN A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR IN THE LATE 1960s, PEOPLE LIKELY WOULD'VE JUST THOUGHT OF HER AS A HIPPIE OR PART OF THE FREE LOVE GENERATION. BUT IN ODESSA, TEXAS, IN 1961, SHE WAS A FEW YEARS AHEAD OF HER TIME. AND I HAD CERTAINLY HEARD TALK ABOUT BETTY'S REPUTATION. THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT BACK THEN FOR BREAKING THE CODE OF GOOD-GIRL BEHAVIOR. WELL, WE KNOW SHE GOT HOME AFTER PLAY PRACTICE WITH Y'ALL LAST NIGHT. BUT YOU'RE SAYING SHE WOULD SNEAK OUT, GO OFF WITH ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF BOYS. ANYBODY SEE HER AT TOMMY'S LATE LAST NIGHT? MNH. - NO. - NO. ANY BOYFRIENDS? SOMEONE SHE'D GET MORE SERIOUS WITH, MAKE PLANS WITH? WELL, BACK LAST SUMMER, UM, SEVEN MONTHS AGO, BETTY DID HAVE A REAL BOYFRIEND THEN. SHE WAS DATING MACK HERRING. HE'S WHAT, A JUNIOR? ** POLICE FIND OUT THAT THE PREVIOUS SUMMER, SHE ACTUALLY HAD A REAL BOYFRIEND... ...A POPULAR FOOTBALL PLAYER NAMED MACK HERRING. MACK HERRING WAS A REALLY NICE-LOOKING GUY, AND HE WAS A BIG MAN ON CAMPUS. EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS THIS NONCONFORMIST REBEL, SHE WAS VERY ATTRACTED TO MACK. IN ODESSA, FOOTBALL PLAYERS RULE THE ROOST. THEY WIN THE MOST POPULAR, THEY WIN THE STUDENT-COUNCIL ELECTION. MACK COULD BE A REALLY SUBDUED, QUIET GUY. HE WAS A MUCH MORE RESERVED PERSON. AND IT WAS ALL OUT THERE WITH BETTY. AND I THINK THAT GAVE HIM SOME FREEDOM, AND HE WAS MORE EXPRESSIVE WHEN HE WAS WITH HER. ** I NEVER SAW THEM OUT TOGETHER. BUT THE LOOK IN BETTY'S EYES WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT MACK... THAT WAS PLAIN AS DAY. ** THE THING WAS, BEFORE SCHOOL STARTED AGAIN, MACK WAS DATING ANOTHER, MORE POPULAR GIRL, AND IT SEEMED PRETTY CLEAR THAT HE SAW BETTY AS A SUMMER FLING. IT MUST'VE HURT BETTY A TON WHEN MACK WOULD LOOK THROUGH HER LIKE SHE WASN'T EVEN THERE. SO THEY BROKE UP? THAT WAS ALL THE WAY BACK LAST SUMMER. THEY'RE FRIENDS NOW. IS THAT RIGHT? YEAH, WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE BETTY WILLIAMS MIGHT BE. SO, ANYBODY HEARD FROM MACK THIS MORNING? YES. HE'S HERE. MACK'S BEEN AT SCHOOL ALL DAY. GREAT. OKAY. DON'T MAKE US WASTE OUR TIME HERE. IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE BETTY MIGHT BE, YOU BETTER COME OUT WITH IT. W-WOULD YOU HAVE TO TELL HER PARENTS? IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING WEIGHING ON YOUR MIND, THAT MEANS WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT. THERE'S AN OLDER GUY. BETTY WAS INVOLVED WITH A DEEJAY AT A RADIO STATION. HE WAS OLDER. HE WAS LIKE A MAN WITH A 17 YEAR OLD. IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, I WAS THINKING, "BETTY, YOU'RE GONNA BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE WHEN YOUR PARENTS FIND OUT." SOMETIMES SHE'D SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT OVER AT HIS PLACE. SO I TOLD THE POLICE SHE MAY BE AT THIS GUY'S HOUSE. OKAY, THAT'S ALL WE NEED. TELL THEM. NO. LET'S JUST -- THANKS, KIDS. HAVE A GOOD DAY, OKAY? YOU SAID "ANYTHING AT ALL"? TELL YOU ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT BETTY? WELL, BETTY STARTED ASKING PEOPLE IF THEY WOULD KILL HER. SHE DID WHAT? SHE STRAIGHT-OUT ASKED ME TO KILL HER. SHE ASKED ME, TOO. SHE ASKED A FEW OF US WHO WERE WORKING ON THE PLAY. SHE STRAIGHT-OUT ASKED ME TO KILL HER. SHE ASKED ME, TOO. SHE ASKED A FEW OF US WHO WERE WORKING ON THE PLAY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ASKING PEOPLE TO KILL HER? WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT? SHE TOOK THE WAY PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT HER AFTER BILL ROSE PRETTY HARD. ** BILL ROSE WAS GORGEOUS, AND HE WAS ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM. THE MOST POPULAR GUY AT ODESSA HIGH SCHOOL. ** BETTY WAS PROUDLY PROMISCUOUS. AND SHE RECOUNTED MANY OF HER SEXUAL EXPERIENCES IN HER DIARY. ONE NIGHT, THE PHONE RANG, AND BETTY SAID, "HEY, SHEL? GUESS WHO I SCREWED TONIGHT?" AND I SAID, "WHAT? WHO?" AND SHE SAID, "BILL ROSE." BUT WHEN WORD GOT AROUND, AND IT ALWAYS DOES, THAT'S WHEN THINGS GOT REALLY BAD FOR BETTY. BILL ROSE AND MACK WERE REALLY CLOSE FRIENDS. THERE WERE VERY CAREFULLY PRESCRIBED RULES, AND THERE WERE FAR MORE RULES FOR GIRLS. TO HAVE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HER BEING A WHORE AND SLUTTY, SHE FELT THE CONTEMPT. FOR BETTY, IT WAS ABSOLUTE HELL. ANY TIME ANYBODY'S DISCUSSING SUICIDE TALK, ABOUT DEATH AND KILLING THEMSELVES, IT'S AN IMPORTANT RED FLAG, AND IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY, NO MATTER WHAT. WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL YOU CAN TELL US ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN BETTY'S LIFE? WELL, SHE DIDN'T GET CAST IN THE PLAY. GAYLE GOT THE LEAD. I WAS CAST AS THE LEAD IN "WINTERSET." I THOUGHT SHE WAS AT REHEARSAL WORKING ON THE PLAY WITH ALL OF YOU. SHE WAS, BUT BETTY GOT MADE THE STAGE MANAGER. ALL RIGHT, TAKE IT EASY. THERE WAS A NEW DRAMA TEACHER, AND BETTY WAS NOT PICKED, AND THIS DEVASTATED HER. ** MACK HERRING WAS ALSO IN THE PLAY. SHE HAD TO WATCH GAYLE AND MACK, HER FRIEND AND HER EX-BOYFRIEND, PERFORMING ONSTAGE, AND SHE WAS IN THE BACKGROUND. THE SENIOR PLAY, FOR A DRAMA MAJOR, IS EVERYTHING. W-WE WROTE OFF APPLICATIONS TO COLLEGE. WE WERE GONNA STUDY THEATER AT INDIANA UNIVERSITY TOGETHER, UNTIL THE THING WITH HER FATHER HAPPENED. WHAT HAPPENED WITH HER FATHER? WE ALL KNEW HOW SERIOUSLY MR. WILLIAMS TOOK THEIR FAITH. AND BETTY WAS WILLFUL, INDEPENDENT, SO HE WAS ALWAYS WONDERING WHAT SHE MIGHT BE GETTING UP TO OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF HIS WATCHFUL EYE. HER FATHER, WHO WAS EXTREMELY STRICT, DISCOVERED BETTY'S DIARY WITH HER SEXUAL HISTORY. WHAT IS THIS? WHAT ARE YOU WRITING IN HERE? SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN. SIT. TELL ME YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS. MY GOD. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU. THAT IS SINFUL, AND YOU KNOW IT. I'M SORRY. DON'T "SORRY" ME. YOU'RE DISHONORING ME AND THIS FAMILY. AND YOUR MOTHER. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR MOTHER? HAVE YOU READ THAT? I TOLD YOU. I TOLD YOU ABOUT HER. JOHN, COME ON, PLEASE. YOU BE QUIET. THIS CAME FOR YOU. YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA GO AWAY? WELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING AWAY. YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE AND YOU'RE GONNA GET A JOB. AND YOU'RE GONNA STAY IN CHURCH. THAT HURTS ME. YOU'RE A RUINED GIRL. YOU'VE KILLED ME. SORRY. YOU NEED TO GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES AND PRAY. SO SHE ACTUALLY WAS TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE, OR WANTING SOMEONE TO KILL HER? YEAH. SHE DIDN'T MEAN IT. WAIT. THAT WAS JUST TYPICAL BETTY. SHE DIDN'T REALLY MEAN IT. ALL RIGHT, TAKE IT EASY. MAYBE YOU'RE LYING TO ME AND MAYBE YOU'RE NOT. MIKE, WOULD YOU KILL ME? WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, BETTY? I WON'T EVER BE HAPPY, SO IT'S PROBABLY JUST BEST IF I JUST DIE. WOULD YOU DO IT? WELL, I COULD DO IT, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN AFFORD MY FEE. WAIT. WHY...? SHE CAN BE OVERLY DRAMATIC. RIGHT. HER PARENTS ARE WORRIED. YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. TELL US AGAIN ABOUT THE LAST TIME YOU SAW BETTY AT PLAY REHEARSAL LAST NIGHT. TAKE US THROUGH IT STEP BY STEP. WAS SHE ACTING STRANGELY? SHE SEEMED NORMAL. RE-REHEARSAL ENDED A LITTLE BEFORE 10:00, AND WE ALL WENT HOME. I LEFT WITH MACK HERRING. HE WAS GIVING ME A RIDE HOME. ** AND I SAW BETTY LEAVE WITH IKE NAIL. SO, WHO'S IKE NAIL? HE'S A FOOTBALL PLAYER, TOO. HE'S BEEN WORKING ON THE PLAY WITH US. SO, POLICE QUESTION IKE BECAUSE HE DROVE HER HOME. HE WAS THE LAST PERSON TO SEE HER BEFORE HER PARENTS SAW HER. SO, WE HEAR YOU DROVE BETTY WILLIAMS HOME LAST NIGHT. WHAT TIME DID YOU DROP HER OFF? I DROPPED HER OFF ABOUT 10:00, I THINK. AND THAT WAS THE LAST YOU SAW HER? WELL, NO. SHE ASKED ME TO COME BACK, DRIVE AROUND TO THE ALLEY BEHIND HER HOUSE. AND? DID YOU? YEAH. NIGHT, MOM. AFTER BETTY SAID GOODNIGHT, SHE CHANGED INTO BABYDOLL PINK PAJAMAS. SHE CAME OUT FROM HER ROOM. WE JUST TALKED FOR AWHILE. SO YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON TO SEE HER AFTER HER PARENTS THOUGHT SHE WAS IN BED? ** WHERE IS BETTY WILLIAMS? THAT'S THE QUESTION THE WHOLE SCHOOL WAS ASKING BY THE AFTERNOON. AND OUR CLASSMATE IKE NAIL SEEMED LIKE HE MIGHT KNOW WHEN HE ADMITTED TO THE POLICE THAT BETTY HAD SNUCK OUT TO SEE HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE. SO YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON TO SEE HER. NO. WHEN WE WERE THERE... ANOTHER CAR DROVE INTO THE ALLEY RIGHT BEHIND US. MY GOSH. I DIDN'T THINK HE'D ACTUALLY COME. COULD YOU TELL WHO IT WAS? WELL, YEAH. I RECOGNIZED THE CAR. IT WAS MACK HERRING. BETTY GOT IN THE CAR WITH HIM? ** YES, SIR. THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SAW HER. ALL RIGHT, IKE. JUST WAIT OUTSIDE NOW. BUT MACK AND BETTY BROKE UP SEVEN MONTHS AGO, SO WHEN WE SAW MACK WALKING DOWN THE HALL, IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT ABOUT WHERE BETTY WILLIAMS MIGHT BE. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HER? I GUESS IT WAS AT REHEARSAL LAST NIGHT. WE WERE ALL THERE TOGETHER WORKING ON THE PLAY, AND THEN EVERYONE WENT HOME. ARE YOU SURE? YES, SIR. WE HAVE IT THAT YOU PICKED UP BETTY AT HER HOUSE, ABOUT 11:00 LAST NIGHT, AND BETTY GOT IN YOUR CAR, AND THE TWO OF YOU DROVE OFF TOGETHER. WELL, I GUESS THAT'S RIGHT. IT WAS LATE, AND I DON'T WANT TO GET HER INTO TROUBLE. WE DROVE AROUND A LITTLE AND TALKED, BUT THEN I DROPPED HER OFF BACK HOME AROUND MIDNIGHT, AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HER AFTER THAT. DID YOU SEE HER ACTUALLY GO INSIDE THE HOUSE? NO, I -- I GUESS I DIDN'T. I PULLED UP IN FRONT AND I LET HER OUT. BETTY HAS A DOOR IN HER BEDROOM THAT OPENS TO THE OUTSIDE. IF SHE'S GOING THROUGH THE FRONT, SHE RISKS WAKING UP HER PARENTS. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO THE POLICE. AND THEN I LEFT. I -- I DON'T KNOW IF SHE ACTUALLY WENT INSIDE. YEAH, THAT STORY'S NOT GONNA FLY. SO THINK REAL HARD HERE. NEXT STEP IS TAKING YOU DOWN TO THE STATION. CALL YOUR PARENTS. IF YOU HELPED HER RUN AWAY, WHATEVER IT IS, IF YOU KNOW WHERE THIS GIRL IS, YOU'RE GOING TO TELL US ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. DO YOU KNOW WHERE BETTY WILLIAMS IS? I DROVE HER OUT TO MY DAD'S HUNTING LEASE. I CAN -- I CAN TAKE YOU OUT THERE. ** THE POLICE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY'RE GOING. THEY END UP DRIVING 26 MILES OUT OF TOWN. AT A CERTAIN POINT, MACK TOLD THEM TO TURN IN... ...WHICH TOOK THEM TO A STOCK POND. SO, WE PARKED JUST OVER THERE. AND THEN WE WALKED DOWN JUST TO HERE. SO? WHERE IS SHE? HAVE YOU EVER FELT TIME SLOW DOWN, WHEN WHAT IS HAPPENING IS SO BEYOND BELIEF? YOUR MIND CAN'T CATCH UP WITH WHAT YOU'RE SEEING? EVEN AS MACK STRIPPED DOWN AND WADED OUT IN THE WATER, THEY HAD TO BE WONDERING, WHAT COULD THIS POSSIBLY HAVE TO DO WITH BETTY WILLIAMS MISSING SCHOOL? ** GOD. ** THE POLICE AND REPORTERS DRIVE TO THE STOCK POND, AND THEY'RE JUST APPALLED AND SHOCKED. BETTY WAS STILL IN HER BABYDOLL PINK PAJAMAS. THE BACK OF HER HEAD HAD BEEN BLOWN OFF BY A 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN. SHE'S WEIGHTED DOWN WITH TWO LEAD WEIGHTS. MY GOD, SON, WHY DID YOU DO IT? SHE ASKED ME TO. HEY, MACK? HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON? UM, I'VE GOT AN IMPORTANT QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK YOU. OKAY. WHAT IS IT? UM... WOULD YOU KILL ME? GEEZ, BETTY. UM... SILLY. HE TELLS POLICE THAT WHEN SHE FIRST ASKED HIM, THEY LAUGHED IT OFF. BUT SHE WOULDN'T STOP. SHE KEPT COMING BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN. COME ON. GET OUT OF HERE. THIS WAS SEVEN MONTHS SINCE THEY BROKE UP. AND DURING THE SCHOOL PLAY, MACK AND BETTY RENEWED THEIR FRIENDSHIP A BIT. HE HAD NEVER DONE IT BEFORE, SO SHE GAVE HIM TIPS AND HELPED HIM RUN LINES. ...BE SEEING YOU. HEY, MACK? YEAH? I KNOW I ASKED YOU LAST NIGHT, BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA GET ANY HAPPIER. SHE BEGGED ME. SAID SHE COULDN'T KEEP LIVING THE WAY SHE WAS. SAID SHE WANTED TO DIE. SO FINALLY I SAID YES. AND AT THAT POINT, THEY BEGAN MAKING PLANS. MACK GOT THE WIRE, WENT TO THE THEATER, AND GOT WEIGHTS FROM THE THEATER. HE HAD BETTY COME OVER AND PICK OUT A SHOTGUN. MACK WENT TO HER HOUSE. BUT SHE WAS WITH IKE NAIL. I DIDN'T THINK HE'D ACTUALLY COME. WELL, I GUESS I'D BETTER CALL HIS BLUFF... EVEN IF IT KILLS ME. IKE TOLD THE POLICE THAT SHE WAS SURPRISED THAT MACK HAD COME. AND THEN THEY TOOK THIS LONG TRIP UNDER THE TEXAS SKY. WAS SHE UPSET? SHE WASN'T SAD, SHE WAS HAPPY. WE TALKED ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS. SHE KEPT SAYING WHAT IT WAS GONNA BE LIKE IN HEAVEN. HOW EXACTLY DID YOU SHOOT HER? READY? THIS HERE IS GOOD? YEAH. IT'S FINE. ALL RIGHT. WAIT. I'M COLD. I'M JUST GONNA GO BACK AND GRAB MY DUSTER REALLY FAST. OKAY. I'LL -- I'LL STAY HERE. RIGHT HERE OKAY? YEAH, THAT'S PERFECT. CAN I GET A KISS TO REMEMBER YOU BY? OF COURSE. THANKS, MACK. I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU FOR THAT. I THINK IT'D BE BEST IF YOU KNELT. HERE? YEAH, THAT'S PERFECT. OKAY. NOW. ** WASN'T BETTY YOUR FRIEND? DIDN'T YOU FEEL SOMETHING ABOUT ENDING HER LIFE? I FELT SORRY FOR HER. I FELT TOWARD HER LIKE I WOULD A CAT LYING IN A MUDDY STREET IN THE RAIN. POLICE OBSERVE THAT HE'S FRIGHTENINGLY CALM AND LUCID. SHE WAS DEAD, LIKE THAT. THEY HAVE A CONFESSION, SO THEY CHARGE HIM WITH FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. UNDER THE POPULAR FOOTBALL-PLAYER FACE THAT WE ALL SAW, THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE INSIDE MACK HERRING THAT ALLOWED HIM TO PULL THE TRIGGER. IT WAS A TOTAL SHOCK, AND IT WAS TERMED THE "KISS AND KILL MURDER." I REMEMBER CRYING FOR HOURS. FOR ME, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE I KNEW THEM BOTH. WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH HER MIND? WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH HIS MIND? HOW COULD THEY HAVE DONE THIS? THE BREAKUP HAD BEEN A LONG TIME AGO. THERE HADN'T BEEN ANY KIND OF INDICATION OF FIGHTS THAT WOULD SUGGEST, LIKE, AN ESCALATING CONFLICT. RUMORS WERE SPREADING LIKE WILDFIRE THAT BETTY WAS PREGNANT, AND THAT MACK SHOT HER SO THAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO MARRY HER. BUT THAT WAS RULED OUT BY THE MEDICAL EXAMINER. AND IN SOME PARTS OF THE SCHOOL, THE WHISPER CAMPAIGN QUICKLY TURNED FROM BEING ABOUT POOR BETTY TO SPECULATING ABOUT HOW THIS COULDN'T REALLY BE MACK'S FAULT. MACK AND HIS FAMILY HAD A VERY GOOD, CLEAN-CUT IMAGE, SO PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT SOMEHOW SHE RUINED THAT BOY'S LIFE. HIS FAMILY HIRED WARREN BURNETT. AND AS SOON AS WARREN BURNETT WAS ON THE CASE... ...THEY WENT STRAIGHT TO A NEVER-BEFORE TYPE OF HEARING IN THE STATE OF TEXAS -- A SANITY HEARING -- TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE INDEED GOING TO HAVE A MURDER TRIAL. THE SIDE BEHIND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS EMPTY, EXCEPT FOR BETTY'S PARENTS. THE KEY WITNESS WAS DR. MARVIN GRICE OF ODESSA. I EXAMINED MACK HERRING THREE DAYS AFTER THE SHOOTING, AND AT THAT MOMENT, HE WAS SANE. BUT THE GIRL ASKED MR. HERRING OVER AND OVER TO KILL HER. EVEN THOUGH THERE'D ONLY BEEN ABOUT 10 OR 15 MINUTES OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN BETTY AND MACK SPREAD OUT OVER A COUPLE OF DAYS, DR. GRICE CLAIMED THAT BETTY'S PUSHING ON MACK HERRING TO HELP WITH HER SUICIDE HAD WORN DOWN MACK'S LOGICAL FACULTIES, AND THAT HE WAS TEMPORARILY INSANE. MR. HERRING, WOULD YOU PLEASE TAKE THE STAND? BUT THE DEFENSE STILL HAD A KEY WITNESS TO CALL, AND IT WASN'T MACK'S FATHER, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS THE ONE TAKING THE STAND. I'D LIKE YOU TO READ THE LETTER GIVEN TO YOU BY YOUR SON MACK. IT'S BEEN EXAMINED BY EXPERTS, AND DETERMINED THAT IT IS BETTY WILLIAMS' OWN HANDWRITING. IT TURNED OUT IT WAS BETTY HERSELF. YOU'D REALLY BE HELPING ME OUT. LOOK, WHAT IF I WROTE A LETTER? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'RE GONNA WRITE A LETTER? LOOK, I'LL SHOW YOU. "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN, I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO IN NO WAY IMPLICATES ANYONE ELSE. I'M WAGING A WAR WITHIN MYSELF, SO RATHER THAN ADMIT DEFEAT, I'M GOING TO BEAT A QUICK RETREAT INTO THE NO MAN'S LAND OF DEATH." IT WAS AS IF BETTY WAS TESTIFYING IN DEFENSE OF HER OWN KILLER. "A FRIEND OF MINE HAS GRACIOUSLY CONSENTED TO LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS. HIS NAME IS MACK HERRING, AND I PRAY THAT HE WILL NOT HAVE TO SUFFER FOR WHAT HE IS DOING FOR MY SAKE." HER STRANGENESS IS PUT ON DISPLAY. I THINK BETTY WAS SERIOUSLY UPSET, AND I THINK THAT SHE WAS REALLY TRYING TO GET ATTENTION. BETTY AND MACK HAD BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP, AND I THINK THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO REKINDLE THAT RELATIONSHIP. THIS IS JUST MY OPINION, BUT... I DIDN'T THINK HE'D ACTUALLY COME. ...I THINK SHE WAS PLAYING A GAME OF CHICKEN. KEEPING THIS WHOLE THING GOING MAY VERY WELL HAVE BEEN A WAY OF KEEPING MACK'S ATTENTION ON HER. "I HAVE GOT TO CALL HIS BLUFF. I'VE MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS. I CAN'T NOW TELL HIM, 'NO, NO, I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN IT.'" THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A PART OF HIM THAT THOUGHT FOR SURE SHE WAS GONNA SAY, "MY GOD. NO, DON'T DO IT, DON'T DO IT." THE MESSAGE WASN'T "I WANT TO DIE," THE MESSAGE WAS "I WANT MACK TO CARE ENOUGH ABOUT ME TO SAVE ME." DO YOU FIND THAT AT THE TIME OF THE ACT CHARGED IN THIS CASE, THE DEFENDANT, JOHN MACK HERRING, WAS TEMPORARILY INSANE? YES, WE DO. THEY FOUND THAT MACK HERRING WAS INSANE FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT TOOK HIM TO PULL THE TRIGGER, AND NOT BEFORE OR AFTER. THAT RINGS SO FALSE TO ME. MACK HERRING HAD BROUGHT TOOLS WITH HIM. HE HID THE BODY, AND THEN ATTEMPTED TO LIE TO THE POLICE. HE MAY HAVE BEEN STILL SECRETLY ANGRY AT HER BECAUSE OF BILL ROSE. HE MAY HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG. SHE DIDN'T COME FROM A RICH, PROMINENT FAMILY, AND THE ANSWER THAT MOST PEOPLE IN ODESSA CAME UP WITH IS, SHE WAS LOOSE, SHE WAS EASY, SHE WAS CHEAP, SHE WAS A SLUT. SHE HAD NO VALUE, AND THEREFORE, HER DEATH WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE. BETTY DESERVED A LOT BETTER. IT'S AS MUCH A TRAGEDY AS IT IS A MURDER. WHY DID THIS HAPPEN? EVEN NOW, I DON'T KNOW. BETTY AND MACK WERE BOTH JUST KIDS. BETTY WAS DEPRESSED, AND DID THINGS THAT WERE DRAMATIC AND SEEMED STRANGE. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE SHE WANTED TO DIE. I THINK SHE WAS JUST SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE TO TELL HER THAT THEY SAW HER, AND REALLY LOVED HER. AND SHE COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE COLD THING INSIDE THE BOY SHE REACHED OUT TO FOR THAT. SHE HAD A WONDERFUL CAPACITY FOR HAPPINESS THAT SHE WOULD HAVE FULFILLED HAD SHE BEEN ABLE TO LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO DO SO. * YOU TOLD ME THINGS YOU NEVER MEANT * * FOOLED ME RIGHT FROM THE START * * AND THOUGH YOU'RE NOT TRUE, MAY GOD BLESS YOU * * THAT'S THE CURSE OF AN ACHING HEART *
