 HELLO, DEAR. GOOD TO SEE YOU. ON EASTER SUNDAY IN 1937, ETHEL KUDNER AND HER HUSBAND, JOE, ARRIVE AT HER MOTHER'S APARTMENT IN BEEKMAN PLACE ON THE EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN. - THEY'RE NOT ANSWERING. - NO? AND HER FATHER, JOSEPH GEDEON, IS ALREADY THERE. JOSEPH GEDEON IS SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE. BUT THEY WERE GONNA HAVE DINNER AS A FAMILY. YOU SEE? THE DOOR'S OPEN. MA? RONNIE? MA? THEY DISCOVER THE NAKED BODY OF VERONICA GEDEON, ETHEL'S YOUNGER SISTER AND JOSEPH'S DAUGHTER. WHERE'S MOTHER? THEY GO AROUND THE APARTMENT, AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR MARY. NO. IN ANOTHER BEDROOM, THEY FIND THE BODY OF THEIR BOARDER, A MAN NAMED FRANK BURNS, AN ENGLISHMAN. AND HE HAS BEEN STABBED MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE HEAD AND NECK. MY GOD. WHERE'S MOTHER? MAYBE SHE WENT TO GET HELP. BUT THEY STILL CAN'T FIND MARY GEDEON. THEY IMMEDIATELY CALL THE POLICE. THE POLICE LOOK AROUND AND NOTICE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING UNDERNEATH THE BED -- THE BODY OF MARY GEDEON, JOSEPH'S WIFE AND ETHEL'S MOTHER. WE FOUND ANOTHER BODY. IT'S MARY. JOSEPH GEDEON TAKES THE NEWS WITH SURPRISING CALM. A TRIPLE MURDER ON EASTER MORNING? TAKE IT FROM ME. THE CRIME-BEAT PHOTOGRAPHERS I KNEW WOULD ELBOW THE CORONER OUT OF THE WAY JUST TO GET THE FIRST SHOT OF THE BODY. IN THOSE DAYS, IT WAS VERY COMMON FOR REPORTERS TO BE PHOTOGRAPHING A CRIME SCENE AT THE SAME TIME THE POLICE PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE THERE. MANUAL ASPHYXIATION. THE MEDICAL EXAMINER CONCLUDES THAT BOTH VERONICA AND MARY HAD BEEN STRANGLED. STRANGULATION HAPPENS OUT OF ANGER. IT'S EXPLOSIVE. IT'S REALLY A CRIME OF PASSION. MARY GEDEON IS STILL CLOTHED, BUT HER UNDERWEAR HAS BEEN TORN AWAY. POLICE ARE ASSUMING THAT THE ATTACK WAS A SEX CRIME. FRANK BURNS, THE BOARDER, HAD BEEN MURDERED IN HIS SLEEP BY A SERIES OF PUNCTURE WOUNDS TO HIS SKULL, INFLICTED WITH A VERY LONG, POINTED IMPLEMENT, POSSIBLY AN ICE PICK. - ANYTHING? - NO. IT'S CLEAN. - HE JUST WALKED IN. HE DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING. THERE WAS STILL MONEY IN THE APARTMENT. THE DOOR IS PERFECTLY INTACT. RIGHT AWAY, THESE THINGS LEAD DETECTIVES TO BELIEVE THAT THE PERPETRATOR WAS SOMEBODY THAT THE VICTIMS KNEW. LOOK VERY CAREFULLY. IF ANYTHING WAS TAKEN, IT WILL HELP US FIGURE OUT WHO DID THIS. WAIT. THERE WAS A LITTLE CLOCK RIGHT THERE ON HER DRESSER. - YOU'RE SURE? - YES. I REMEMBER ITS HANDS GLOWED IN THE DARK. IS THIS YOUR SISTER? YES. SHE WAS A MODEL. MAYBE PUT YOUR ARM UP, LIKE YOU'RE BEING ATTACKED. SORRY. AW. WHY YOU -- WHY YOU MOVE? I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY, SORRY. JUST GO BACK IN. WE'LL GO BACK IN. RONNIE GEDEON WAS 20 YEARS OLD. AND SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL, YOUNG BLONDE. AND SHE OFTEN POSED FOR THE PULP DETECTIVE MAGAZINES OF THE TIME. THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. RONNIE WAS A SWEETHEART. DON'T GET ME WRONG. I HIRED HER FOR HER FIGURE. THAT WAS THE NAME OF THE GAME IN THE DETECTIVE-RAG BUSINESS. WHEN SHE WAS ON THE COVER, SHE'D SELL OUT NEWSSTANDS ALL OVER THE CITY. AND THE OLD MAN SAYS, "ARE YOU KIDDING? I'M TELLING EVERYONE." BUT FOR THOSE OF US PUTTING IN HOURS AT THE STUDIO, IT MATTERED JUST AS MUCH HOW A GIRL ACTED. SOME GIRLS IN THE BUSINESS HAD SUNK REAL LOW OR HELD THEIR NOSES UP TOO HIGH. RONNIE WAS JUST A REAL SWEET KID. IN 1937, A YOUNG WOMAN WHO POSED NAKED WAS REGARDED AS REALLY LITTLE MORE THAN A PROSTITUTE. THIS IMMEDIATELY CASTS RONNIE'S CHARACTER IN A VERY, VERY DUBIOUS LIGHT. BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, I HAD A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON THIS THING. I GUESS I CAN SEE HOW PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T KNOW THE REAL RONNIE MIGHT GET THE WRONG IDEA. AT THE MAGAZINE, I WAS UP TO MY EYEBALLS IN MURDER STORIES EVERY DAY. BUT STILL, I NEVER EXPECTED IT TO HAPPEN TO SOMEONE I KNEW. WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS, PLEASE. BUT LIFE IMITATES ART, AND ART IMITATES LIFE. AND JUST LIKE ALL THE P.I.s AND GUMSHOE DICKS IN OUR MAGAZINES, THESE GUYS WENT RIGHT TO WORK. I HEARD A SCUFFLE COMING FROM UPSTAIRS. - ABOUT WHAT TIME WAS IT? - 11:00 P.M. OVER HERE, THIS TOWEL. MUST HAVE COME IN TO CLEAN UP. AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, THEY FIND VERONICA'S DIARY. WHAT DO YOU GOT? MAYBE SOMETHING. SEE THESE TWO "B's" HERE AND ANOTHER HERE? THEY SEE ENTRIES ABOUT A PERSON WITH JUST THE INITIAL "B." IT'S CLEAR THAT RONNIE HAS BEEN ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH THIS PERSON. BUT HERE, IT SAYS, "I'M AFRAID OF 'B.'" RIGHT AWAY, THAT PIQUES THEIR INTEREST. THAT IS THE START OF THE INVESTIGATION. THEY WANT TO DETERMINE WHO "B" IS. - HELLO? - Hello. Good evening. Is Veronica there, please? WITH WHOM AM I SPEAKING? Stephen Butter. STEPHEN BUTTER? Yes, sir. THE INITIAL IN THE DIARY IS "B." THIS GUY'S LAST NAME STARTS WITH A "B." THEY WANT TO TALK TO HIM. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW VERONICA? Last night. IF YOU HAD ASKED ME IF RONNIE GEDEON WAS HIDING SOMETHING, I WOULD HAVE SAID NO. SHE ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE A STRAIGHT SHOOTER. BUT A SECRET DIARY WITH A MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN REFERRED TO ONLY BY THE INITIAL "B"? I HAD TO HAND IT TO HER. SHE KNEW HOW TO KEEP THEM READING. THAT'S FOR SURE, RIGHT UP UNTIL THE VERY END. I MET HER THROUGH MY FRIEND LINCOLN. HE'S OUT OF TOWN. STEPHEN BUTTER PICKED HER UP A COUPLE OF TIMES FROM THE STUDIO AFTER A PHOTO SHOOT. WAS HE THE OMINOUS "B" IN HER DIARY? YOU LIKE HER? - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - JUST THAT. WELL, YEAH. SHE'S GREAT, REALLY NICE, FRIENDLY. STEPHEN BUTTER IS 23 YEARS OLD. HE WORKS AS A MESSENGER ON WALL STREET. HE LIVES WITH HIS PARENTS. IS SHE ALL RIGHT? YOU SAID YOU SAW HER LAST NIGHT? YE-- YES. WE WENT TO A BAR. AND THEN I WALKED HER HOME. THANKS AGAIN. THAT WAS ACES. IT WAS MY PLEASURE. - WHAT TIME WAS THAT? - A LITTLE AFTER 3:00. WE LEFT THE BAR AT 3:00, I REMEMBER. YOU GO INSIDE WITH HER? I'D INVITE YOU IN, BUT MY MOTHER'S IN THERE SLEEPING. TOO BAD. GOOD NIGHT. IS SHE OKAY? SHE'S DEAD. WHAT? NO. H-HOW? I JUST -- I JUST SAW HER. SH... MY GOD. IN 1937, THE DETECTIVES, THEY GO ON GUT INSTINCT. AND THEIR GUT TELLS THEM THAT HE'S INNOCENT. ** THE DAY AFTER THE BODIES WERE DISCOVERED, THE STORY WAS ON THE FRONT PAGE IN THE PAPERS IN NEW YORK. THE COUNTRY IS IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. SENSATIONAL STORIES LIKE THIS WERE A DISTRACTION. THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS ON THE COVER OF A DETECTIVE MAGAZINE BECOMES A VICTIM IN REAL LIFE. IT WAS PERFECT FOR THE PAPERS. PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO HAD WORKED WITH RONNIE COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK WITH ALL THESE NUDE AND SEMINUDE PHOTOS OF HER, MANY OF WHICH WERE PUBLISHED IN THE PAPERS. THERE WAS NOT ONLY THE HIDEOUSNESS OF THE TRIPLE MURDER, BUT THERE WAS THE SEXUAL ALLURE OF THE PRIMARY VICTIM. AND IT GIVES PEOPLE THE IMPRESSION OF, "THIS MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY FAST-LIVING WOMAN WHO HAD GOT INVOLVED WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE." TO ALL THOSE JOES READING THE PAPER ON THEIR WAY TO WORK AND HOUSEWIVES GOSSIPING OVER THE FENCES, THE STORY WAS JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF ENTERTAINMENT. BUT RONNIE WAS A PART OF OUR WORLD. AND WHAT SHE DID WAS A JOB LIKE ANY OTHER. SHE WASN'T INVOLVED WITH THE SORT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD HURT HER, AS FAR AS WE KNEW. VERONICA WAS AFRAID OF A PERSON WITH THE INITIAL "B." AND AS THE POLICE CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH THE DIARY, THEY SEE A REFERENCE TO A GUY NAMED BOB. IT TURNS OUT THAT VERONICA WAS MARRIED AT 16 TO THIS GUY, BOBBY FLOWERS. - THANKS A LOT. - THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. - YOU BOBBY FLOWERS? - YEAH. THIS ABOUT RONNIE? YOU TALK TO HER LATELY? ABOUT A WEEK AGO. YOU HAD A FALLING OUT? NO. WHY? WHY'D SHE SAY SHE WAS AFRAID OF YOU? COME ON. WE HAD A COUPLE OF ROWS OVER THE YEARS, BUT THINGS WERE PRETTY GOOD. WE WERE JUST TOO YOUNG. HE SAYS THAT THE MARRIAGE WAS ANNULLED AND THAT THEY WERE STILL GOOD FRIENDS. WHERE WERE YOU SATURDAY NIGHT? HE SAYS HE WAS SELLING HOT DOGS AT AN ARMORY. YOU CAN ASK MY BOSS, ASK MY CUSTOMERS. SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL. SHE WASN'T LIKE WHAT ALL THE PAPERS ARE MAKING HER OUT TO BE. OKAY, BOBBY. THE POLICE CHECK OUT HIS ALIBI, AND THEY PRETTY MUCH RULE HIM OUT AS A SUSPECT. VERONICA GEDEON WAS AN HONEST GIRL. SHE WAS NOT CHEAP. OUR EDITOR HAD HAD ENOUGH. HEADLINE AFTER HEADLINE PAINTED RONNIE AS A LOOSE, FAST-LIVING GIRL. SURE, SHE WAS NO GOODY TWO-SHOES, BUT SHE WASN'T THE WHORE OF BABYLON, EITHER. SHE HAD THE INTELLIGENCE TO SUCCEED IN ANY OF THESE COLUMNS. THE EDITOR OF INSIDE DETECTIVE MAGAZINE PUBLISHES A VERY IMPASSIONED EDITORIAL EXPLAINING THAT RONNIE HAD TAKEN ON THESE JOBS IN ORDER TO MAKE A LIVING, BUT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING QUESTIONABLE ABOUT HER BEHAVIOR. WHILE WE WERE DOING OUR BEST TO CLEAN UP RONNIE'S REPUTATION IN THE PAPERS, THE POLICE WERE COOLING ON THE JEALOUS-LOVER ANGLE AND STARTING TO LOOK CLOSER TO HOME. GENTLEMEN, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? DETECTIVES THINK BACK TO HOW THE FATHER REACTED WHEN THEY FIRST SPOKE TO HIM. WE JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU A COUPLE QUESTIONS. SURE. THEY THINK IT ODD THAT HE DIDN'T SHOW MUCH EMOTION. GO AHEAD. BUT I-I HAVE TO KEEP WORKING. THIS WHOLE THING HAS GOT ME BEHIND. I'VE GOT CUSTOMERS, YOU KNOW. HEY, CAN YOU TELL US HOW IT WAS WITH YOUR WIFE? MARY? WE WERE SEPARATED. I COULDN'T STAND LIVING WITH HER AFTER A WHILE. SHE WAS AN IGNORANT WOMAN, THE WAY SHE WAS RAISING THOSE GIRLS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'VE SEEN IT YOURSELF, DETECTIVE. RONNIE WOULD TAKE HER CLOTHES OFF FOR ANYONE. SHE WAS A TEASE. SHE'D LET A GUY GET THIS CLOSE. YOU CAN'T TALK TO A MAN THAT WAY. I TOLD MARY ABOUT THIS THOUSANDS OF TIMES, AND SHE JUST KEPT GETTING IN THE GODDAMN WAY. SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN. MIND IF WE TAKE A LOOK AROUND, MR. GEDEON? NO. YOU LIKE TO LOOK AT NAKED GIRLS, MR. GEDEON? WHY SHOULDN'T I? I'M A GROWN MAN. WHERE WERE YOU ON THE NIGHT THAT YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KILLED? CORRIGAN'S. I WAS PLAYING Skee-Ball. I STAYED THERE TILL THEY CLOSED. - ANYBODY SEE YOU THERE? - TALK TO CAL. HE WAS THERE ALL NIGHT. EXCUSE ME. HEY, WAIT. THEY FIND A GUN, WHICH IS UNLICENSED, UNREGISTERED. HEY. LOOK AT THIS. AND THEN, THEY FIND A KIT WITH SEVERAL VERY SHARP UPHOLSTERY NEEDLES. THIS IS THE TYPE OF WEAPON THAT WAS USED TO KILL THE BOARDER, FRANK BURNS. ONE MISSING. YEAH. AND ONE OF THE NEEDLES IS MISSING. THAT IS WHERE THE CASE SHIFTS. THEY START FOCUSING IN ON GEDEON VERY HARD. SO THE COPS LIKED THE ANGRY-FATHER ANGLE. HE FOUGHT WITH HIS WIFE, AND SHE WAS DEAD. MAYBE HE DIDN'T LIKE HER TAKING IN GENTLEMEN BOARDERS. AND ONE OF THEM WAS DEAD, TOO. AND HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T APPROVE OF WHAT RONNIE DID FOR A LIVING. I HAD TO ADMIT, IT MADE A CERTAIN SENSE. JOSEPH GEDEON IS THE PRIME SUSPECT. THEY BRING HIM IN FOR QUESTIONING. THE AUTOPSY RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. BUT THE MEDICAL EXAMINER DEDUCES FROM THE CONTENTS OF MARY'S STOMACH THAT SHE WAS MURDERED BETWEEN 10:00 P.M. AND MIDNIGHT. OKAY, WHERE WERE YOU BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 10:00 P.M. AND MIDNIGHT ON THE NIGHT THAT YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE MURDERED? I TOLD YOU. I WAS AT THE BAR. GO ASK HIM, CAL. WE DID. HE SAID THAT HE SAW YOU THERE THAT NIGHT BUT NOT BETWEEN THOSE HOURS. H-HE'S LYING. - DID YOU LEAVE? - NO. I-I WAS THERE. MAYBE YOU GOT DRUNK, WENT TO PAY A VISIT TO THE FAMILY? NOW, ALIBIS FALL APART ALL THE TIME. BUT IT ONLY GOES PART OF THE WAY TO NAILING A GUY. THE BRASS RING IS GETTING THE STORY STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH. THE ABSENCE OF A MURDER WEAPON, UNFORTUNATELY, IS NOT EVIDENCE OF A MURDER WEAPON. SO THEY NEED A CONFESSION. DID YOU LOVE YOUR WIFE? SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO RAISE HER CHILDREN. THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WOULD KILL HER. I TOLD YOU BEFORE. WOMEN TRY TO DOMINATE MEN. MEN SHOULDN'T LET THEM. YOU DON'T CONTROL THEM, THEY START TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU. SO YOU HAD TO DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE, RIGHT? I DID NOT KILL MY FAMILY. WELL, THE 17th PRECINCT WAS THE PRESTIGIOUS COMMAND. THE DETECTIVES THAT WORKED THERE WERE KINGS. THEY RAN THE SHOW. THEY WERE THE BEST OF THE BEST. AND, TO THEM, SOLVING A CRIME HINGES ON THAT CONFESSION. SO THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING IN AND TAKING CRACKS AT GEDEON. HE'S KEPT AWAKE FOR HOURS. HE'S DEPRIVED OF FOOD. BUT DESPITE ALL THEIR EFFORTS, THEY CANNOT GET HIM TO CRACK. SO THEY DECIDE TO TURN UP THE HEAT. THIS WAS THE ERA OF THE THIRD DEGREE. JOSEPH GEDEON HAD BEEN IN THAT INTERROGATION ROOM FOR 12 HOURS, AND THERE WAS STILL NO WORD. IF THEY HADN'T BROKEN HIM YET, THEY STARTED TO THINK MAYBE THERE WAS NOTHING TO BREAK. NOW, MAYBE IT WAS HIS KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE, OR MAYBE IT WAS ALL THOSE YEARS SITTING AT HIS DESK, READING ABOUT CRIME SOLVING AND NEVER GETTING INVOLVED. EITHER WAY, OUR EDITOR HAD A HUNCH. AND HE PLAYED IT. THE EDITOR OF TRUE DETECTIVE MAGAZINE BELIEVES GEDEON IS BEING RAILROADED. YEAH? DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS? SO HE SENDS ONE OF HIS WRITERS TO THE BUILDING WHERE JOSEPH GEDEON LIVED TO REALLY CHECK OUT HIS ALIBI. HE WAS HERE. HE STUMBLED IN A LITTLE AFTER 3:00. THE WRITER FINDS A NEIGHBOR WHO SAYS THAT HE DID INDEED SEE JOSEPH GEDEON STUMBLING HOME DRUNK AT 3:00 A.M. HE WENT INTO HIS APARTMENT AND DIDN'T COME BACK OUT. - ARE YOU SURE? - YES. NOW, THEY HAVE CORROBORATION THAT JOSEPH GEDEON WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT THERE AT 3:00 A.M. SO HE CANNOT BE THE MURDERER. THE POLICE HAD REALLY PUT HIM THROUGH THE RINGER TRYING TO GET A CONFESSION, WHICH OF COURSE HE WOULD NEVER GIVE. STAND UP. AND JOSEPH GEDEON HAS NOW BEEN CLEARED. HEY, IT'S JOE. JOE, HOW DO YOU FEEL? SO GEDEON WAS OUT. THAT GAVE THE PAPERS A NEW ROUND OF HEADLINES BUT LEFT THE POLICE WITH SQUAT. IF THE COPS ONLY KNEW HOW CLOSE THE KILLER REALLY WAS. THEY'VE GOT TO REVIEW THE EVIDENCE THEY HAVE. AND THE ONE THING THAT THEY HAVE STILL IS THE DIARY. IF THEY'D ASKED ME, I WOULD HAVE TOLD THEM IT'S NEVER THAT EASY. THE ANSWER ISN'T JUST GOING TO BE SITTING THERE ALL WRITTEN OUT. NOW, LOOK AT THIS. HERE. IT'S STILL TALKING ABOUT BOB. WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING THEY DIDN'T ASK ME, BECAUSE RONNIE'S LITTLE BOOK STILL HAD MORE SECRETS TO DISCLOSE. "BOB IS OBSESSED WITH ETHEL." NOW, HERE'S THE THING. DETECTIVES HAD ASSUMED THAT BOB, MENTIONED IN RONNIE'S DIARY, WAS BOBBY FLOWERS. BUT THIS BOB HAD A THING FOR RONNIE'S SISTER, ETHEL, AND THAT MADE THEM THINK TWICE. I THINK THERE WERE TWO BOBS, FLOWERS AND SOMEONE ELSE. SOMEONE SCARIER. IN HER DIARY, RONNIE MENTIONS A BOB, AND SHE SAYS THAT HE'S OBSESSED WITH YOU. THAT MUST BE BOB IRWIN. HE WAS A BOARDER IN OUR HOME. HE IS A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY. YOU KNEW HIM WELL? YES. HE LIVED WITH US. WE ALL KNEW HIM. AND DID HE AND RONNIE EVER DATE? NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT. HE -- HE WAS KIND OF INDIFFERENT TO HER. FOR A TIME, HE WAS ACTUALLY PURSUING ME. HE EVEN MADE A LITTLE BUST OF ME ONCE. BOB IRWIN WAS AN ARTIST, SCULPTOR. HE HAD BOARDED WITH THE FAMILY SEVERAL YEARS EARLIER. YOU LOOK SO SERIOUS. YEAH? ETHEL WAS INTRIGUED WITH BOB IRWIN. SHE THOUGHT HE WAS AN AMAZINGLY TALENTED SCULPTOR. HE WAS CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE SOUL MATES. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL, LIKE A GODDESS. STOP THAT. HE WANTED TO MARRY ME, BUT I WAS ALREADY ENGAGED TO JOE. HE'S A VERY DECENT MAN. HE COULDN'T HAVE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS. I'M SURE ETHEL HAD HER OWN OPINIONS, BUT IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME SISTERS DISAGREED ABOUT A MAN. BYE. JUST BECAUSE ETHEL THOUGHT THIS BOB IRWIN WAS A GENTLEMAN DOESN'T MEAN RONNIE DIDN'T HAVE REASON TO BE AFRAID. AFTER ETHEL AND RONNIE'S FATHER LEFT, MRS. GEDEON TOOK ON A LOT OF BOARDERS. I VAGUELY REMEMBER RONNIE MENTIONING THE NAME BOB IRWIN, BUT I COULDN'T SWEAR TO IT. ACCORDING TO RONNIE'S SISTER, ETHEL, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD MUCH REASON TO MENTION HIM. BOB NEVER GAVE RONNIE THE TIME OF DAY. HE ONLY HAD EYES FOR ETHEL. POLICE BEGIN TO INVESTIGATE HIS BACKGROUND, AND THEY DISCOVER THAT BOB HAD PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS AND, IN FACT, HAD SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME CONFINED TO PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTIONS. HE'S HAD A TROUBLED LIFE FROM THE MOMENT OF HIS BIRTH, ESSENTIALLY. BOB IRWIN WAS BORN IN A GOSPEL TENT IN PASADENA, CALIFORNIA. HIS FATHER WAS A SELF-STYLED PREACHER WHO ABANDONED THE FAMILY, AND HIS MOTHER WAS A RELIGIOUS FANATIC WHO PUT HER RELIGION AHEAD OF HER THREE SONS. AND THE THREE BOYS WERE SORT OF LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES. BOTH HIS BROTHERS WERE CAREER CRIMINALS. BOB HAD SPENT YEARS IN REFORM SCHOOL. BOB TOOK HIS SCULPTING VERY SERIOUSLY. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. THANK YOU. HE HAD GONE TO STUDY WITH SOME NOTED ARTISTS, SOME OF WHOM TOOK BOB UNDER THEIR WINGS AND TRIED TO HELP NURTURE HIS TALENT. I'VE WORKED WITH PLENTY OF ARTISTS, AND YOU CAN BET I DATED A FEW OF THEM, TOO. AND A GUY LIKE THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HUNG THE MOON UNTIL THEIR MUSE STRIKES. THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE INVISIBLE. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS. THAT THING THAT MAKES THEM GENIUS... ...ALSO MAKES THEM CRAZY. HE WAS SOMETIMES SEIZED BY THESE PERIODIC OUTBURSTS OF RAGE. HE WAS FIRED AGAIN AND AGAIN BY GETTING SO IRRITATED WITH SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY ELSE DID IN HIS IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT THAT HE ENDED UP GETTING INTO A PHYSICAL ALTERCATION WITH THEM. HE ALSO HAD PHILOSOPHIES THAT WERE AS IMPORTANT TO HIM, IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT, THAN THE SCULPTING. ONE IN PARTICULAR HE CALLED VISUALIZATION. HE BELIEVED THAT, IF HE COULD CONJURE UP IN HIS MIND A PERFECT IMAGE, HE COULD CREATE THESE SCULPTURES PURELY BY MENTAL POWER. IT LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL, BOB. IT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME. BUT HE HAD BECOME CONVINCED THAT HIS SEX DRIVE WAS CHANNELING ENERGY AWAY FROM THIS GREAT ACHIEVEMENT. SO HE ATTEMPTED TO SLICE OFF HIS OWN PENIS. HE DOESN'T SUCCEED, BUT HE JUST INJURED HIMSELF TERRIBLY. ALL THIS INFORMATION CONVINCES THE POLICE THAT HE IS THE MAN. WE HAVE A NEW PRIME SUSPECT. HIS NAME IS ROBERT IRWIN. WHEN THE POLICE ANNOUNCED THEY WERE LOOKING FOR ROBERT IRWIN, THE PAPERS FINALLY HAD A NEW CHARACTER TO WRITE ABOUT, AND THEY COULD BEGIN TO LAY OFF RONNIE. HE'S A SCULPTOR AND FORMER INMATE AT ROCKLAND STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE. WE BELIEVE ROBERT IRWIN IS STILL IN THE CITY. WE BELIEVE HE IS HIDING OUT SOMEWHERE. IF ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC OR THE PRESS SEES ROBERT IRWIN... A LOT OF THE THINGS WE WOULD USE TODAY TO TRACK PEOPLE, CREDIT CARD PURCHASES, TOLLS, THEY DIDN'T EXIST IN 1937. I HAVE ORDERED A CITYWIDE SEARCH. HE WON'T GET FAR. AND THEN, I CAME IN HERE AND SAW THAT HE WAS GONE. IT WAS TWO DAYS AGO. A WOMAN CONTACTS THE POLICE AND TELLS THEM THAT BOB IRWIN WAS RENTING A ROOM FROM HER. HE WATCHED US. HE WAS RIGHT HERE. IT'S RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE 17th PRECINCT AND ONLY A COUPLE BLOCKS FROM THE CRIME SCENE. THE LANDLADY DOES MENTION THAT HE HAD TWO SUITCASES. ONE HAD A STRAP. ONE IN PARTICULAR HAD A BELT AROUND IT TO KEEP IT CLOSED. ** NEW YORK CITY IN THE '30s WAS JUST AS CROWDED AND BUSTLING AS IT IS NOW. AND BOB IRWIN WAS NO CLARK GABLE. HE COULD DISAPPEAR IN A CROWD. SO FINDING HIM IN THAT METROPOLIS, THAT WAS A TALL ORDER, PALLY. NOT EVERYONE, HOWEVER, IS CONVINCED THAT BOB HAS REMAINED IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA. ONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS HAD A HUNCH. BACK THEN, A LOT OF PEOPLE, WHEN THEY LEAVE THE CITY, OFTEN LEAVE LUGGAGE AT GRAND CENTRAL STATION. HE THEORIZED MAYBE IRWIN HAS LEFT, AND HE'S LEFT HIS LUGGAGE BEHIND. AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, HE FINDS A SUITCASE. AND THEY FIND THE ALARM CLOCK MISSING FROM THE GEDEON APARTMENT, PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT ACTUALLY LINKS BOB IRWIN TO THE MURDERS. BUT IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS HE'S LEFT TOWN. THEY PUT OUT AN ALARM ACROSS EIGHT STATES, OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT HE MAY TURN UP IN. THEY HAVE NO SUCCESS. THREE MONTHS PASSED WITHOUT ANY TRACE OF ROBERT IRWIN. WE KNEW THE SON OF A BITCH HAD TO BE OUT THERE. SOMEONE SOMEWHERE SEES HIM EVERY DAY. THEY JUST DON'T KNOW IT YET. WHAT WE NEEDED WAS SOMETHING TO HELP THE POLICE GET THE WORD OUT. AND THEN WE THOUGHT, "HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. MAYBE WE WERE THAT SOMETHING." THE EDITOR OF INSIDE DETECTIVE DECIDES TO RUN A STORY ON THE FRONT COVER ALONG WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF BOB IRWIN AND A REWARD OFFERING $1,000. ABOUT 20,000 IN TODAY'S DOLLARS, SO QUITE A SIGNIFICANT SUM AT THE HEIGHT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. THIS MAGAZINE GOES ACROSS THE NATION. IT REALLY HAS FURTHER REACH THAN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. ONE COPY ENDS UP IN CLEVELAND, OHIO, IN THE HANDS OF A WOMAN NAMED HENRIETTA, WHO WORKS AT THE STATLER HOTEL. HENRIETTA CAN'T BELIEVE HER EYES. THE SUSPECT, BOB IRWIN, LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE THE NEW BARBACK AT THE STATLER, WHOSE NAME ALSO HAPPENS TO BE BOB. SAY, BOB. YES, HENRIETTA? HOW CAN I HELP YOU? - WHAT WAS YOUR LAST NAME AGAIN? - MURRAY. WHY? HENRIETTA KNOWS THAT SOMETHING'S DEFINITELY UP BY HIS REACTION, SO SHE IMMEDIATELY CALLS THE POLICE. BUT TRUE TO FORM, BY THE TIME THEY ARRIVED, ROBERT IRWIN WAS IN THE WIND. AND THIS TIME, IF HE WANTED TO STAY LOST FOREVER, HE PROBABLY COULD HAVE. HELLO. IS THIS THE CHICAGO EXAMINER? TURNS OUT BOB HAD OTHER PLANS. ROBERT IRWIN... WANTS TO GIVE HIMSELF UP. I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN THE MIND OF A GUY LIKE ROBERT IRWIN. BUT SOMETIME, MAYBE WHEN HE WAS ON SOME BUS FROM CLEVELAND TO CHICAGO, HE DECIDED TO STOP RUNNING AND TURN THE TABLES INSTEAD. ROBERT IRWIN WANTS TO GIVE HIMSELF UP. HE CALLS THE EDITOR OF THE CHICAGO HERALD AND EXAMINER. NO, THIS IS NOT A PRANK. HE DECIDES HE MIGHT AS WELL SOMEHOW PROFIT FROM THIS. THAT'LL DO. I'LL SEE YOU THEN. SO IN EXCHANGE FOR AN EXCLUSIVE CONFESSION, HE WANTS $5,000, A WHITE LINEN SUIT, AND A PANAMA HAT. SO THE EDITORS OF THE NEWSPAPER ACTUALLY TAKE BOB IRWIN TO A HOTEL. IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON FOR WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST, THE GREAT AND POWERFUL NEWSPAPER MAGNATE OF THE ERA, TO PAY MONEY TO MURDERERS FOR THEIR CONFESSIONS. BOY, WAS I HUNGRY. WELL, IF YOU'RE READY NOW, WE'D LOVE TO HEAR YOUR STORY. BUT THERE HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN A CASE IN WHICH THE NEWSPAPER KEPT THIS CONFESSED CRIMINAL FROM THE POLICE. I SUPPOSE IT ALL STARTED WITH A GIRL, ETHEL GEDEON. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE TOGETHER. SHE WAS GOING TO BE A PART OF MY WORK. BUT SHE MARRIED SOMEONE ELSE. I COULDN'T CONCENTRATE. SHE WAS DISTRACTING ME FROM MY ART. I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT, BUT I HAD TO. SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE I WANTED. I DIDN'T PLAN ON KILLING ANYONE ELSE. HE WANTS TO KILL ETHEL, BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO DESTROY HER BEAUTY. HE DECIDES HE'S GOING TO JUST STAB HER IN THE BACK OF THE NECK. SO HE SPENDS TIME ACTUALLY SHARPENING AN ICE PICK. AND THEN HEADED FOR THE GEDEON APARTMENT. WHEN HE GOT THERE, HE FINDS MARY GEDEON, WHO INVITED HIM IN. THE BOARDER ACTUALLY CAME HOME, AND MARY INTRODUCED THEM. HE KEPT ASKING, "WHEN IS ETHEL COMING HOME?" AND MARY KEPT INSISTING ETHEL WAS NOT LIVING THERE ANYMORE. SHE DIDN'T EVEN LIVE THERE. YOU HAD TO HAVE KNOWN THAT. HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT SHE DID LIVE THERE. HE WAS OBVIOUSLY DELUSIONAL. WHEN YOU GET IN A MIX-UP LIKE THAT, TIME MEANS NOTHING. FINALLY, MARY GREW IMPATIENT AND TOLD BOB TO LEAVE. BOB SAYS, "I AM NOT LEAVING UNTIL ETHEL GETS HERE." MARY TELLS BOB THAT, IF HE DOESN'T LEAVE RIGHT AWAY, SHE'S GOING TO WAKE UP THE BOARDER. WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT VIEWING THE WORLD IN THE SAME WAY THAT -- THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE, IT'S DIFFICULT, OFTEN, TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MOTIVATIONS. AND AT THAT POINT, BOB WENT COMPLETELY CRAZY. BOB POUNCES ON MARY AND STARTS CHOKING HER. ALL THIS TIME, THE DAMN ENGLISHMAN WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM BUT 10 FEET AWAY. REMARKABLY, FRANK BURNS IS DEAF IN ONE EAR AND HAD BEEN SLEEPING ON THE OTHER SIDE. BOB IS STILL DETERMINED THAT HE'S GOING TO WAIT FOR ETHEL. BUT IT OCCURS TO HIM THAT RONNIE MIGHT COME HOME FIRST. AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO KILL RONNIE. SO HE'S READ SOMEWHERE THAT A BAR OF SOAP CAN BE USED AS A BILLY CLUB. IF RONNIE COMES HOME FIRST, HE'S GOING TO KNOCK HER OUT AND TIE HER UP. GOOD NIGHT. * COME TO ME, MY MELANCHOLY BABY * RONNIE COMES IN, AND SHE GOES INTO THE BATHROOM TO GET CLEANED UP BEFORE BED. I WASN'T GOING TO KILL HER. DOESN'T KNOCK HER OUT, BUT SHE CAN'T SEE WHO HER ASSAILANT IS. PLEASE, PLEASE! BOB! BOB! PLEASE! SOMEHOW, SHE KNEW. I JUST DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE. HE ALSO SAYS THAT THE ALARM CLOCK HAS A GREEN GLOW TO IT, LIKE EYES STARING AT HIM. THE SUN CAME UP, AND IT OCCURS TO HIM THAT THE BOARDER HAS SEEN HIM. SO HE STABS HIM 11 TIMES IN THE HEAD AND NECK. THEN, HE LEAVES THE APARTMENT AND THREE DEAD BODIES BEHIND. I'M CERTAINLY SORRY I KILLED ALL THREE OF THEM. I WAS ONLY AFTER ONE, AND THAT WAS ETHEL. THE CONFESSION IS PUBLISHED. BOB IRWIN IS TURNED OVER TO THE NYPD AND RETURNED TO NEW YORK. AND HE'S A CELEBRITY OF SORTS YOU KNOW, HIS PICTURE'S ALL OVER THE PAPER. BOB IRWIN IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. HOWEVER, THE PSYCHIATRY STAFF FIND THAT HE IS VERY MENTALLY ILL, AND BOB IRWIN IS TRANSFERRED TO A PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY. HE SPENT THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE INSTITUTIONALIZED. SO THAT WAS IT -- RONNIE AND MARY GEDEON AND FRANK BURNS ALL JUST INNOCENT VICTIMS IN SOME NUTCASE'S DELUSIONAL QUEST, NO MEANING, NO MORAL, NOTHING BUT A DAMN SHAME. BUT THEN, SOMEONE LIKE ME COMES IN TO PAINT THE GIRLS PRETTIER, MAKE THE MURDER BLOODIER AND TURN THE TRAGEDY INTO SOMETHING THRILLING WITH A LESSON FOR THE READERS, YOU KNOW, GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT -- ONE HELL OF A STORY. * COME TO ME, MY MELANCHOLY BABY * * SMILE, MY HONEY DEAR * * WHILE I KISS AWAY EACH TEAR * * OR ELSE I SHALL BE MELANCHOLY, TOO *
