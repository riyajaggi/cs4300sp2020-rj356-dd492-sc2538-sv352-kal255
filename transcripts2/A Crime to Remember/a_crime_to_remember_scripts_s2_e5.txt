 IT'S NOT FOR YOUR LITTLE EARS. [ GIGGLES ] Woman: I ALWAYS THOUGHT GRETCHEN FRITZ WAS LUCKY. SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL, HER PARENTS HAD MONEY, AND EVEN HER KID SISTER WAS SWEET. Young woman: HEY, I HEARD THERE'S ANOTHER PARTY TONIGHT. YOU COMING? SO IF I WAS KIND OF SNOTTY AROUND HER, I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE I WAS JEALOUS. MAYBE WE ALL WERE. YEAH, I'M COMING. WE'RE GOING. READY TO GO TO A PARTY? BUT I FEEL AWFUL THINKING ABOUT IT NOW...

 [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] ...BECAUSE THAT NIGHT, AT THE CACTUS DRIVE-IN, WHEN GRETCHEN DROVE OFF INTO THE DARK, THAT WAS IT. NONE OF US EVER SAW THE FRITZ SISTERS ALIVE AGAIN. TUCSON, ARIZONA, IN 1965, WAS A STRANGE COMBINATION OF A BOOMTOWN, THE OLD WILD WEST, AND NOWHERESVILLE. Schafer: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL SPOT BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS, BUT IT IS STARK. Marsh: LIKE A LOT OF OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, TUCSON AND THE AREA HAD THIS BOOMING POPULATION OF ADOLESCENTS. A REALLY BIG NUMBER OF KIDS WOULD CONGREGATE WITH ALMOST NO SUPERVISION. THE PLACE TO GO WITHOUT PARENTS AND TEACHERS BREATHING DOWN YOUR NECK WAS SPEEDWAY. IT WAS JUST A BUNCH OF GAS STATIONS, CAR WASHES, BOWLING ALLEYS, LIKE THAT. BUT IT WAS BETTER THAN BEING BORED OUT OF YOUR SKULL AT HOME. I BECAME A COP IN 1958, WITH THE TUCSON POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND BY 1965, THE CULTURE HAD CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY. THESE TEENS WERE GOING NUTS. Young woman: [ Laughing ] OH, MY GOD, GUYS! Young man: OH, NOT IN MY BACKSEAT! BOOZE, STAYING OUT ALL NIGHT, AND SEX. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE WASN'T REALLY ANYTHING ELSE TO DO. OUT OF MY FACE! Marsh: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT ADOLESCENTS IS HOW MUCH MORE PRONE THEY ARE TO ENGAGING IN BAD BEHAVIOR WHEN THEY ARE AROUND EACH OTHER. Detective: WAS THERE ANYTHING UNUSUAL GOING ON LATELY HERE AT HOME? WERE THE GIRLS FIGHTING? ANY OTHER PROBLEMS? NO. NO, UH, WE'D JUST GOTTEN BACK FORM CALIFORNIA THIS WEEK. EVERYTHING SEEMED NORMAL, AND THEN... WE HAD AN EVENT TO ATTEND LAST NIGHT, AND THE GIRLS WANTED TO GO TO A MOVIE. THE LAST TIME THE FRITZES SAW THEIR DAUGHTERS WAS 7:30 THE NIGHT BEFORE, AND THEY WERE GOING TO THE CACTUS DRIVE-IN. IF IT WAS -- IF IT WAS JUST GRETCHEN, WE WOULDN'T BE WORRIED. BUT WENDY DOES NOT BEHAVE LIKE THIS. WHY DO YOU SAY THAT, "JUST GRETCHEN"? HI, THERE. WHAT'S UP? IS THAT CIGARETTE FOR ME? BUT GRETCHEN WASN'T JUST PRETTY AND RICH. SHE HAD AN EDGE. SHE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT, A THRILL. THEY HAD HAD PROBLEMS WITH GRETCHEN BEFORE, SNEAKING OUT AND HAVING BOYS SNEAK IN. HEY. Young man: HEY. HOW'S IT GOING? GOOD. SEE THAT TALL GUY OVER THERE? WELL, HE WAS TELLING ME THAT HE COULD BEAT THE TWO OF YOU UP. Dupnik: GRETCHEN HAD ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM. SHE LIKED TO BE THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION. GET OFF, FELLAS! HEY! McNamara: THE POLICE HAD A BIT OF A HISTORY WITH GRETCHEN FROM SOME JUVENILE INCIDENTS. GRETCHEN WANTED TO DO WHAT GRETCHEN WANTED TO DO. Dupnik: BUT THEY WERE TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT CHILDREN. WENDY, THE YOUNGER ONE, WAS A MODEL CHILD AND WOULD NEVER STAY OUT ALL NIGHT. SO IF ANY OF US HAD TO GUESS HOW THE FRITZ GIRLS GOT INTO TROUBLE, IT WAS PROBABLY SOMETHING TO DO WITH GRETCHEN. DO YOU REMEMBER SEEING EITHER OF THESE TWO GIRLS? SURE, YEAH. THE POLICE WENT TO THAT DRIVE-IN. McNamara: IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THEY HAD BEEN THERE, HAD SEEN THE MOVIE. DID YOU SEE WHO SHE LEFT WITH? NO, NOT AT ALL. McNamara: SO THEY PUT AN APB ON GRETCHEN'S CAR. SHE HAD A BRAND-NEW PONTIAC, AND IF SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL THIS WEEK, SHE DIDN'T GO THIS WEEK. GRETCHEN'S NEW PONTIAC MEANT SHE COULD JUST TAKE OFF ON HER OWN, SO THE POLICE PROBABLY THOUGHT IF YOU FOUND GRETCHEN'S CAR, YOU'D FIND HER. [ SIGHS ] YOU ARE AWARE IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR GIRLS AT THIS AGE TO RUN AWAY? IN 1965, TEENAGERS OUTNUMBERED GROWN-UPS JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE. IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN. ALL THOSE BABIES BORN RIGHT AFTER WORLD WAR II HAD TO GROW UP SOMEDAY. ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE THE FRITZ GIRLS DISAPPEARED... SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL GIRL. ...THERE WAS ANOTHER GIRL WHO WAS 15, AND HER NAME WAS ALLEEN ROWE. ALLEEN ROWE DISAPPEARED WHILE THE MOTHER WAS AT WORK, AT NIGHT. SO POLICE GOT REPORTS ALL THE TIME ABOUT TEENS WHO RAN AWAY, AND MOST OF THE TIME, THEY CAME BACK AGAIN JUST FINE. SHE'S NOT A RUNAWAY. SHE'S MISSING. MOST OF THE TIME. AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FRITZ'S WORST NIGHTMARE TO HAVE THEIR DAUGHTERS STAY LOST, LIKE ALLEEN. [ THUNDER CRASHES ] THE FRITZ FAMILY BECAME SO FRUSTRATED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT'S INABILITY TO FIND THE KIDS THAT THEY WENT OUT AND HIRED A PRIVATE DETECTIVE. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] McNamara: FOUR DAYS AFTER THE GIRLS GO MISSING, HEILIG FINDS GRETCHEN'S PONTIAC IN THE PARKING LOT OF THE FLAMINGO HOTEL, WHICH IS RIGHT NEAR THE SPEEDWAY. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. DETECTIVE, YOU GOT TO COME SEE THIS. McNamara: SO HEILIG CALLS IN THE POLICE. AND THEY EXAMINE THE CAR. GRETCHEN'S PURSE IS STILL IN THERE. THERE'S A $20 BILL IN THERE. WHEN THEY DO A CANVASS, NO ONE CAN TELL THEM, YOU KNOW, ANYTHING -- WHO DROPPED IT OFF, WHO DROVE IT THERE. BUT, EERILY, THE ODOMETER IS DISCONNECTED, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT MAYBE SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO MASK MILEAGE ON THE CAR. WHEN THEY FOUND GRETCHEN'S CAR, THEY KNEW SHE HADN'T JUST TAKEN OFF ON HER OWN. IT LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE HAD TAKEN HER... AND WAS TRYING TO COVER THEIR TRACKS. Woman: THE FRITZ SISTERS HAD VANISHED, LAST SEEN AT THE CACTUS DRIVE-IN IN TUCSON. THEIR CAR HAD BEEN FOUND IN A MOTEL PARKING LOT... BUT THERE WAS NO TRACE OF THE GIRLS. GRETCHEN, THE OLDER ONE, WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HAD ALWAYS GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION, SO IT MADE SENSE WHEN THE POLICE GOT WIND OF A BOY THAT COULD HAVE TAKEN HER AWAY... ...SOMEONE FROM OUT OF STATE. Dupnik: GRETCHEN WAS BRAGGING ABOUT SOME GUY THAT SHE GOT INVOLVED WITH OVER IN SAN DIEGO. BUT SHE HADN'T SAID THE NAME, AND SHE COULD HAVE MET SOMEONE AT THE BEACH, SHE COULD HAVE MET SOMEONE AT THE HOTEL. Dupnik: THE SAN DIEGO POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD A PICTURE, OF COURSE, OF THE FRITZ GIRLS, AND THEY, IN FACT, INTERROGATED DIFFERENT PEOPLE, BUT THEY WERE NEVER ABLE TO COME UP WITH ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION. TO OUR UNDERSTANDING, YOU USED TO DATE GRETCHEN FRITZ. YES, AT ONE POINT, YEAH, WE WERE KIND OF A THING. SO THE SEARCH FOR GRETCHEN CAME BACK HOME TO OUR GROUP IN TUCSON, AND THE COPS WANTED TO TALK TO ANY GUYS GRETCHEN HAD BEEN INVOLVED WITH AROUND HERE. Detective: IS THERE ANYTHING YOU COULD TELL US ABOUT GRETCHEN'S WHEREABOUTS? MY GUESS IS THAT SHE RAN AWAY. THAT'S SOMETHING GRETCHEN WOULD DO. SHE DIDN'T HAVE AN EASY FAMILY LIFE. Dupnik: CHARLES SCHMID LIVED IN A SMALL HOUSE NEXT TO HIS PARENTS. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] Marsh: CHARLIE SCHMID WAS A PRETTY GOOD-LOOKING GUY -- WELL-BUILT, GOOD ATHLETE. HE WAS ALSO 23. Marsh: HE LOVED TO THROW PARTIES. Dupnik: AND EVERYBODY WANTED TO GO TO THOSE PARTIES. Marsh: HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO DREW PEOPLE TO HIM. Schafer: AND GRETCHEN WAS ONE OF THEM. SMITTY WAS BITCHIN', AS WE USED TO SAY. WE ALL THOUGHT SO. WHEN HE LAID EYES ON YOU, IT FELT LIKE YOU WERE THE ONLY GIRL IN THE ROOM. BUT THE THING WAS, SMITTY LAID EYES ON A LOT OF GIRLS. WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG, YOU NEVER BELIEVE THE GUYS YOU DATE COULD BE DANGEROUS. [ "HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN" PLAYS ] * THERE IS A HOUSE IN NEW ORLEANS * * THEY CALL THE RISING SUN * * IT'S BEEN THE RUIN OF MANY A POOR BOY * * ME, OH, GOD, FOR ONE * HE COULD PLAY THE GUITAR AND SING A LITTLE BIT. Schafer: THE KIDS REALLY LOOKED UP TO HIM. HE WAS SMART. HE WAS A MUSICIAN. AND KIDS WERE SORT OF FREE OVER THERE TO DO WHAT THEY WANT. SO WHEN GRETCHEN FRITZ WENT MISSING... THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ...OF COURSE THE COPS LOOKED AT HER EX-BOYFRIEND. THIS IS A CHEVY MALIBU. YOU KNOW WHAT'S UNDER THAT? YEAH. CHECK IT OUT. BUT THEY FOUND OUT THAT CHARLIE SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME WORKING ON CARS AND HANGING OUT. CHARLIE SCHMID HAD NO CRIMINAL HISTORY AT ALL. CHARLIE SCHMID WAS KIND OF A MODEL CHILD. WELL, THERE WAS ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL THAT HUNG AROUND WHO WAS EXTREMELY INTERESTING TO THE POLICE. EVERYONE KNEW RICHIE BRUNS. HE WAS A CREEP AND A LONER. AND THE RUMOR WAS HE'D BEEN CAUGHT UP IN A MURDER BEFORE. SO, DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE? NO, I DON'T. WHY AM I HERE? GRETCHEN FRITZ. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. I'M SORRY. Woman: WHAT WE HEARD WAS THE POLICE DIDN'T HAVE ANY REAL SUSPECTS AT ALL. BUT GRETCHEN DID HANG AROUND THE SPEEDWAY CROWD, AND A LOT OF KIDS THERE HAD RECORDS. RICHIE BRUNS -- HE HAD DONE A LOT OF PETTY CRIMES. HE WAS CHRONICALLY SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL. Schafer: AND DIDN'T SEEM TO GIVE A DAMN. AND HE WAS RUMORED TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A MURDER. THE STORY WENT THAT A COUPLE YEARS BACK, RICHIE BRUNS HAD BEEN AT WORK WHEN HE GOT APPROACHED BY SOME OLDER GUY. Bruns: YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET YOUR SPARKS AND YOUR PLUGS FIXED, TOO. Man: THANK YOU. Gilmore: SOME OLDER GUY WANTED TO BUY HIM BEER, AND, OF COURSE, RICHIE, YOU KNOW, ANYBODY GONNA BUY HIM BEER, HE'S GONNA SIT AND TALK TO YOU FOR A WHILE. I DID RUN AWAY ONCE, YOU KNOW. YOU WANT TO RUN AWAY? HE SHOWED HIM THIS GUN. [ GUN COCKS ] .38. AND RICHIE SAID, "OH, MAN, THAT'S SO COOL." WHY DON'T WE GO ON IN? AND THE GUY PROPOSITIONED HIM. AND RICHE DECIDED HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED WITH THIS GUY ANYMORE, AND HE LEFT. McNamara: ABOUT A DAY LATER, THE MAN IS FOUND SHOT DEAD IN A DITCH. HE SAID HE WANTED TO BUY ME BEER. I GOT IN HIS CAR. HE'S A QUEER, THOUGH. I'M NOT HIS FRIEND. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. RICHIE'S FINGERPRINTS WERE ON THE GUN. IT TURNS OUT, SOME GUY IN PHOENIX ACTUALLY KILLED THE MAN, BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER. THIS WAS GRADE-A GOSSIP, AND STORIES ABOUT RICHIE BRUNS TOOK OFF. AND AFTER THE FRITZ GIRLS WENT MISSING, THE POLICE WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT ANYONE WE THOUGHT WAS SHADY... HOW YOU DOING? ...AND WHETHER THEY'D EVER CROSSED PATHS WITH GRETCHEN. WE HEARD YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT RICHIE BRUNS. RICHIE BRUNS IS A CREEP. RICHIE WAS YOUR CLASSIC OUTSIDER. NONE OF THE KIDS LIKED HIM. HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT LOOKING COOL, BUT HE WAS NOT VERY GOOD AT THAT. HE SHOWED UP, AND THEY, LIKE, LOOK AT ALL OF US AND SAY, LIKE -- THEY START... HEY. SORRY, EXCUSE ME. YEAH. UM... HEY. I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT OR ANYTHING, BUT I WAS -- I WAS AT THE, UH, I WAS AT THE SHOP THE OTHER DAY... RICHIE HAD A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME TRYING TO FIND GIRLS THAT HE COULD DATE. Schafer: HE THOUGHT THEY WERE SHUNNING HIM. THEY WOULDN'T COME NEAR HIM. THEY WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH HIM. I THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK REALLY PRETTY ON YOU. SEE, IT'S A HEART... FOR YOU. UH, WHY DON'T WE GRAB A COKE OR SOMETHING? YEAH. HANG ON A MINUTE. Marsh: RICHIE WAS OBSESSIVE WITH GIRLS. HE WOULD TURN PEOPLE OFF BY HIS OVERLY INTENSE WAY OF APPROACHING THEM. KATHY, I SPENT A LOT OF MONEY -- DON'T TOUCH ME, MAN. DON'T TOUCH ME, ALL RIGHT? HE WOULD, YOU KNOW, NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER, JUST APPEAR AT THE HOUSE, FOLLOW THEM AROUND, INCLUDING STALKING ONE OF HIS EX-GIRLFRIENDS. Gilmore: TO THE POINT WHERE THE FATHER CALLED THE POLICE A COUPLE TIMES. [ LIGHTER CLICKS ] PLEASURE MEETING YOU. YOU, TOO. SEE YOU LATER. NEED A LIGHT? YEAH. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT KATHY? PRETTY CUTE. I DON'T KNOW. BUT CHARLIE SCHMID WAS WILLING TO GIVE RICHIE A CHANCE, AND EVERYONE WANTED TO GET TO HANG OUT WITH SMITTY. YOU WANT A BEER? HELL, YEAH, I'LL TAKE A BEER. AND ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WOULD KIND OF PAL AROUND WITH HIM WAS CHARLIE. BEING AROUND SOMEBODY LIKE CHARLIE SCHMID, YOU WOULD GET TO FEEL LIKE YOU WERE ALSO ONE OF THE COOL GUYS. CHARLIE TRIED TO HELP RICHIE BY TAKING HIM ON DOUBLE DATES. TRYING TO SOCIALIZE HIM, I GUESS. AND THE COPS PUT TOGETHER THAT IF CHARLIE WAS BRINGING RICHIE ALONG ON DATES... HE MUST HAVE KNOWN GRETCHEN PRETTY WELL. BRUNS HAD A HORRIBLE PERSONALITY. AND WAS NOT EXACTLY CHARMING. YOU'RE A DEEP-FREEZE BITCH! DO NOT SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY MANNERS?! DO YOU HAVE ANY MANNERS?! AND JUST ROYALLY PISSED OFF GRETCHEN. PIECE OF SCUM! GRETCHEN HAD A REALLY VOLATILE PERSONALITY. JUST LEAVE! JUST DON'T TALK, OKAY? DO NOT TALK TO US. SHUT UP. SHUT UP. AND, ACTUALLY, SHE ALSO HAD A HUGE TEMPER. LET'S JUST GO. AND FROM THAT DAY ON, RICHIE AND GRETCHEN HATED EACH OTHER AND GOT INTO A LOT OF ARGUMENTS. STOP LOOKING THIS WAY, OKAY? PLEASE, IT'S VERY CREEPY. SHUT UP. IT'S SO RUDE. IT'S SO RUDE. I CAN HEAR YOU. I CAN HEAR YOU, YOU KNOW. OKAY, SO THEN DON'T LISTEN TO US. Dupnik: SHE ENJOYED TORMENTING PEOPLE. SHE ENJOYED CONFRONTATION. AND SHE USUALLY WON. YES, I AM TALKING ABOUT YOU. Marsh: AND FOR A SOCIALLY AWKWARD GUY, THAT MADE THINGS EVEN WORSE. GO AWAY! WE DON'T WANT YOU HERE. THAT GRETCHEN'S EVIL, MAN. SHE DESERVES TO DIE. DISGUSTING, MAN. SHE'S A LITTLE RICH GIRL. MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE CARE OF IT MYSELF, YEAH? [ CHUCKLES ] HE JUST REALLY, REALLY HATED HER. HE WOULD NOT MIND SEEING HER DEAD. IF YOU LOOK AT IT LIKE WE ALL DID, RICHIE WAS BARELY HANGING ONTO HIS SOCIAL LIFE AS IT WAS, AND THEN GRETCHEN TRIED TO MAKE ALL THE GIRLS SHUT HIM OUT FOR GOOD. THAT WAS ABOUT AS BAD AS IT GOT. SO IT STOOD TO REASON RICHIE WOULD WANT REVENGE. Woman: NO ONE HAD SEEN GRETCHEN AND WENDY FRITZ FOR WEEKS, AND THEN TUCSON POLICE HEARD THAT RICHIE BRUNS SAID THAT HE THOUGHT GRETCHEN DESERVED TO DIE. SO THEY CAME AROUND, TRYING TO FIND OUT IF THEY COULD CONNECT RICHIE TO THE GIRLS' DISAPPEARANCE. WE HAVE IT ON GOOD ACCOUNTS THAT YOU REALLY DIDN'T LIKE GRETCHEN. I... I MEAN, YEAH, I DIDN'T LIKE HER. YEAH. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. SHE DIDN'T LIKE ME, EITHER. BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. SORRY. EVEN THOUGH RICHIE HAD A LONG RAP SHEET AND TOLD ANYONE WHO'D LISTEN HOW MUCH HE HATED GRETCHEN, THE POLICE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING SOLID TO CONNECT HIM TO WHATEVER ACTUALLY HAPPENED. McNamara: THEY DON'T HAVE A BODY. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BLOOD. THEY DON'T HAVE A TRAIL. SO REALLY, THEY'RE AT A DEAD END. IF I WERE YOU, I'D WATCH YOUR STEP. OKAY. SO THE POLICE KEPT PUSHING EVERYONE IN OUR CROWD, TRYING TO GET SOMETHING, ANYTHING, TO SHAKE LOOSE. STILL ASKING ABOUT THOSE TWO SISTERS. McNamara: POLICE CONTINUED TO TALK TO THIS TEEN SPEEDWAY CROWD. GRETCHEN FRITZ -- DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING? Woman: NO. I KNOW GRETCHEN. SHE'S A SNOTTY, LITTLE BITCH. THEN THEY GET TO MARY FRENCH. SHE WAS NOT SHY ABOUT HER DISLIKE FOR GRETCHEN EITHER. Marsh: MARY FRENCH WAS A GIRL WHO MOST PEOPLE WHO KNEW HER DESCRIBED AS NOT BRIGHT INTELLECTUALLY, AND WHO ALSO TENDED TO GET IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. SHE DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL, AND SHE WAS A PRETTY HEAVY DRINKER. SHE CAROUSED WITH THE GROUP AND DID WHAT THE GROUP DID. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] Dupnik: MARY FRENCH WAS ONE OF CHARLIE SCHMID'S GIRLFRIENDS. Gilmore: MARY FRENCH WAS VERY JEALOUS WHEN HE STARTED FOOLING AROUND SO MUCH WITH GRETCHEN FRITZ. Schafer: I DON'T THINK GRETCHEN GAVE AS MUCH A DAMN AS MARY DID, BECAUSE GRETCHEN HAD OTHER BOYS, TOO. WE DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER BOYS THAT MARY HAD. SHE WAS VERY MUCH AGAINST SCHMID GOING WITH ANYBODY, BUT ESPECIALLY GRETCHEN. YOU COULD TELL THAT SHE KNEW THAT HE REALLY LIKED GRETCHEN. BUT MARY WASN'T JUST JEALOUS OF GRETCHEN. SHE WAS READY TO FIGHT TO GET CHARLIE FOR KEEPS, AND SHE HAD ONE HELL OF A CARD TO PLAY. IT WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE GRETCHEN WENT MISSING. THERE WAS A BIG PARTY AT CHARLIE'S HOUSE. Dupnik: MARY FRENCH WAS NOT A NICE PERSON. SHE HAD AN EVIL, DARK SIDE TO HER. French: EXCUSE ME, GRETCHEN. COULD YOU PLEASE HAVE SOME RESPECT? HE'S WITH ME, OKAY? NO. NO, I KNOW YOU CAN'T, 'CAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A BITCH. THERE'S NO DISCUSSION, OKAY? HE IS WITH ME. STOP! OH, YEAH? OH, YEAH? HE'S WITH ME. HOW MANY GUYS ARE YOU WITH?! McNamara: AND THAT CULMINATED IN THIS HUGE, DRAMATIC FIGHT. MARY BLURTED OUT, "I'M PREGNANT." BUT GRETCHEN WASN'T GONNA WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE. SHE ALWAYS WANTED TO WIN. AND THEN GRETCHEN -- "I'M PREGNANT, TOO!" EVERYONE WAS WITNESS TO THIS. OH, YEAH?! HOW MANY OTHER BOYS HAVE YOU BEEN WITH, GRETCHEN?! GRETCHEN WAS PROBABLY JUST FAKING, FOR FUN OR CONTROL OR WHATEVER, BUT I HEARD MARY REALLY WAS PREGNANT, SO NOW SHE NEEDED SMITTY ALL TO HERSELF. Schafer: ACCORDING TO HER, SHE WAS GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT HE WOULD MARRY HER. SO, MARY, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GRETCHEN? SHE WAS A RICH GIRL... THE KIND OF GIRL WHO COULD TAKE WHATEVER SHE WANTED, GET... WHATEVER SHE WANTED. YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT, DID YOU? NO. Schafer: SHE WAS A KID, BUT SHE HAD A STARE LIKE NOBODY ELSE. HER EYES -- I MEAN, SHE COULD GET ONTO YOURS, AND SHE'D STAY RIGHT THERE. DETECTIVE ROBLES -- SHE REALLY BOTHERED HIM. AND HE WAS AN OLD VETERAN. EVERYONE KNEW HOW SPOOKY MARY WAS, BUT IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE THAT MADE THE POLICE THINK SHE COULD ME MIXED UP IN THE FRITZ GIRLS' DISAPPEARANCE. THEY'D ACTUALLY QUESTIONED MARY BEFORE ABOUT ANOTHER MISSING GIRL. Marsh: THEY INTERVIEWED HER A YEAR AGO, WHEN ALLEEN ROWE WENT MISSING. REMEMBER ALLEEN ROWE? WE DID. THE COPS HAD CHALKED HER UP AS JUST ANOTHER TEEN RUNAWAY, BUT WE ALL KNEW DIFFERENT. ALLEEN WASN'T LIKE GRETCHEN AND MARY. SHE WASN'T PART OF THE SPEEDWAY SCENE. Dupnik: ALLEEN ROWE WAS A MODEL KID -- GOOD STUDENT AND NEVER WAS A PROBLEM TO HER MOTHER OR TO ANYBODY. Marsh: BUT WHAT SHE DID HAVE WAS A NEIGHBOR NAMED MARY FRENCH. ALLEEN. COME ON IN. HER MOTHER NEVER FELT COMFORTABLE WITH MARY, SO MRS. ROWE DIRECTED THE POLICE TO MARY FRENCH. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE COPS PUT TOGETHER WHAT US KIDS ON SPEEDWAY HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG -- THERE WAS A CONNECTION BETWEEN ALLEEN ROWE AND THE FRITZ SISTERS. BUT MARY DIDN'T FLINCH. IF SHE KNEW MORE, THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO TO GET HER TO TALK. WEREN'T THESE FRIENDS OF YOURS? NO. AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY? NO. IS THERE ANYTHING AT ALL YOU'D LIKE TO TELL US? THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME TO TELL. DO YOU KNOW GRETCHEN? I DON'T KNOW. McNamara: THE POLICE ARE SO CONVINCED THAT THE ANSWERS ARE WITH THIS TEEN SPEEDWAY CROWD THAT THEY JUST, YOU KNOW, KEEP GOING BACK TO THEM. THERE HAD TO BE SOMETHING THERE THAT THE KIDS KNEW. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO TELL? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT GRETCHEN? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT THE KIDS WEREN'T TALKING. Dupnik: THE QUESTIONING WENT ON FOR MONTHS, AND IT WENT ON VERY INTENSELY. YOU KNOW WITHHOLDING INFORMATION IS PUNISHABLE BY JAIL TIME?! DON'T TALK TO MY SON THAT WAY. LET'S GO. McNamara: THE PARENTS ACTUALLY GOT A COURT ORDER TO STOP THE POLICE FROM QUESTIONING THEIR KIDS. THE POLICE GOT VERY HEAVILY EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THEY WERE SO FRUSTRATED. THERE JUST AREN'T ANY MORE LEADS TO FOLLOW. McNamara: YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES, CASES ARE BROKEN JUST BY A LUCKY BREAK... [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] ...A LUCKY PHONE CALL. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] THE PHONE RANG, AND IT WAS RICHIE BRUNS. RICHIE BRUNS -- REMEMBER THAT GIRL HE WAS OBSESSED WITH? WELL, THAT SITUATION HAD GOTTEN WAY OUT OF CONTROL. DUE TO RICHIE'S CONTINUAL HARASSMENT... Schafer: HE WAS SENT BY THE LOCAL MUNICIPAL COURT TO OHIO ON PROBATION. McNamara: WHERE HIS GRANDMOTHER LIVED. Schafer: BUT HE HAD LASTED ONLY, I THINK, A COUPLE OF DAYS. HE WAS AFRAID THAT THE GIRL THAT HE LIKED WAS GONNA BE KILLED OR RAPED. I THINK HE WAS GENUINE ABOUT THAT. CAN YOU CONNECT ME TO THE TUCSON POLICE DEPARTMENT, PLEASE? YEAH, THIS IS, UH, THIS IS RICHIE BRUNS. I HAVE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE FRITZ GIRLS. YEAH, I'LL, UH, I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW. CAN YOU JUST GET ME BACK TO TUCSON, PLEASE? YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO TURN LEFT UP HERE. Detective: UP HERE? YEAH. Woman: IT HAD BEEN OVER TWO MONTHS OF THE POLICE QUESTIONING US AND HUNTING DOWN DEAD ENDS, AND THEN, OUT OF THE BLUE, A CALL FROM RICHIE BRUNS FINALLY BROKE THE WHOLE STORY OPEN. Schafer: HE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED, AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET BACK TO TUCSON WAS TO TELL THE STORY TO THE POLICE. IT ALL STARTED WITH THE ALLEEN GIRL. SHE WAS BLOND AND PRETTY IN THE FACE. McNamara: RICHIE BRUNS TELLS POLICE CHARLIE GOT IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT HE WANTED TO KILL A GIRL. HE WANTED TO SEE WHAT IT FELT LIKE. HE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE EXCITING, A BIT OF A THRILL. AND MARY HELPED HIM DO IT. SHE'S GOT SCHOOL TOMORROW. THIS WAS YOUR JOB. I'LL CALL HER. GET HER TO GO OUT ON A DOUBLE DATE WITH JOHN. I'LL COME PICK YOU UP. I'LL HAVE JOHN WITH ME. I WANT TO DO IT TONIGHT. I WANT HER. I LOVE YOU. WE NEED TO DO THIS. YOU PROMISED ME. OKAY. THEY LURED ALLEEN OUT BY INSISTING THAT SHE GO ON A DOUBLE DATE WITH THIS GUY, JOHN SAUNDERS, WHO WAS A FRIEND OF CHARLIE'S. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT. ALLEEN, YOU LIKE THIS PART OF THE DESERT? YEAH, IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL. WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT IT? IT'S... THE CALMNESS. ALLEEN WAS A NICE GIRL, AND SHE TRUSTED MARY. THEY WERE NEIGHBORS, AND THEY WERE FRIENDS. IT'S THE FARTHEST EDGE OF INSANE, BUT SOMEHOW CHARLIE SCHMID HAD CONVINCED TWO OTHER KIDS TO LURE A GIRL TO HER MURDER -- MARY FRENCH AND JOHN SAUNDERS. THE POLICE WERE HUNTING FOR A KILLER IN THE SPEEDWAY CROWD, BUT FINDING A GROUP OF THEM -- THAT WAS TOUCHING EVIL. McNamara: CHARLIE WAS ABLE TO MANIPULATE TROUBLED TEENS BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THAT HE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE SPECIAL. Schafer: THEY'D DO WHATEVER HE WANTED THEM TO, AND BRUNS SAID THAT. I MEAN, THAT'S AS COLD AS THE DEVIL, WHEN YOU THINK OF IT. I KNOW A GREAT SPOT, UH, DOWN A LITTLE BIT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT? YEAH, SURE. JOHN? YEAH. Mary: I'LL HANG HERE. I WANT TO LISTEN TO THE RADIO. SUIT YOURSELF. Schafer: SCHMID SAID, "RAPE HER." JOHN SAUNDERS COULDN'T DO IT, AND SCHMID SAID, "ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT." AND HE RAPED HER. [ ALLEEN SCREAMING IN DISTANCE ] [ ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ] McNamara: IN THE CAR, MARY CAN HEAR THE SCREAMS. [ SCREAMING CONTINUES ] Marsh: IT'S POSSIBLE THAT MARY WAS SOMEWHAT CONFLICTED. HE TOOK A ROCK AND HIT HER IN THE HEAD TWICE, AND THAT'S WHAT KILLED HER. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. MMM, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. WE GOT TO GET THE SHOVEL. WE GOT WORK TO DO, BABY, OKAY? YEAH. [ ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES ] McNamara: TOGETHER, THE THREE OF THEM BURY HER IN THE DESERT. HE WAS TELLING EVERYBODY ABOUT WHAT HE DID TO HER. HE WAS EVEN BRAGGING ABOUT IT. HE BRAGGED ABOUT KILLING ALLEEN TO A NUMBER OF KIDS. McNamara: CHARLIE LOVED THE ADORATION FROM THIS TEEN CROWD. HE LIKED TO INSTILL FEAR IN PEOPLE, TOO, AND PEOPLE WERE AFRAID OF HIM. BUT NOT EVERYONE WAS AFRAID, EVEN WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN. Marsh: GRETCHEN WAS, HERSELF, PRETTY MENTALLY UNSTABLE. HER APPROACH TO THAT DISCOVERY WAS NOT THE NORMAL FEAR AND RUNNING FOR THE POLICE. Dupnik: BRUNS CLAIMED THAT GRETCHEN HELD IT OVER HIS HEAD TO EXTORT WHATEVER SHE WANTED OUT OF CHARLIE SCHMID. IF CHARLIE THOUGHT GRETCHEN WAS GONNA BE INTIMIDATED BY THE ALLEEN STORY, HE THOUGHT WRONG. GRETCHEN WASN'T THAT KIND OF GIRL. FOR HER, IT WAS LEVERAGE -- THE PERFECT THREAT FOR WHENEVER CHARLIE STEPPED OUT OF LINE. THAT WAS THE WAY SHE WANTED TO MAKE USE OF THIS REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF INFORMATION, WAS TO USE IT AS A WEAPON. AND THEN THE FRITZ FAMILY TOOK THEIR VACATION TO SAN DIEGO. BUT INSTEAD OF DISTANCE COOLING THINGS OFF, IT ONLY MADE THEM WORSE. WHILE SHE WAS AWAY, CHARLIE WAS LIVING IT UP AND HAVING THESE PARTIES, AND WHEN GRETCHEN GOT WIND OF THIS, SHE WAS REALLY UPSET. [ MOVIE SOUNDTRACK PLAYING ] WELL, DON'T WAIT. I'LL GROW UP, AND I'LL NEVER GO. YOU HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND STICK TO THEM. IF YOU DON'T, YOU NEVER GET ANYPLACE. HEY. I HEARD THERE'S ANOTHER PARTY TONIGHT. YOU COMING? RICHIE BRUNS TELLS POLICE THAT GRETCHEN WAS AT THE MOVIE. WE'RE GOING. I'LL SEE YOU AT SMITTY'S. YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU AT SMITTY'S. AND SHE HEARS THAT CHARLIE'S HAVING A PARTY, WHICH JUST MAKES HER REALLY ANGRY. I JUST TOLD GRETCHEN WHAT I'D HEARD THAT NIGHT AT THE DRIVE-IN. "THERE'S A PARTY. EVERYONE'S GONNA BE AT SMITTY'S." [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] I HAD NO IDEA IT WASN'T TRUE, OR THAT SOME STUPID WORDS COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH COULD TURN SO AWFUL. WHAT GIVES YOU THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO? OH, MAYBE ALL THE GUYS YOU SCREWED. NO, THAT IS EXACTLY NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU DIDN'T CONTACT ME, AND YOU'VE BEEN CONTACTING OTHER GIRLS. WHAT IS -- WHAT IS THE PROBLEM THERE? DO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM THERE? I DON'T SEE ANYTHING. INSTANTLY, THEY JUST START FIGHTING. TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THESE OTHER GIRLS... TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE -- ...INVITING THEM TO OTHER PARTIES AND NOT TELLING ME ABOUT IT AT ALL? YOU ARE NOTHING! YOU ARE NOTHING, OKAY?! [ Voice breaking ] YOU'RE SUCH A PIECE OF SCUM! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?! IT'S NOT OKAY! GRETCHEN WAS IMPULSIVE AND AGGRESSIVE AND WILD. SHE LOVED LASHING OUT, GETTING HER WAY. BUT SHE COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT WHEN SHE TANGLED WITH CHARLIE SCHMID, SHE WAS RUNNING INTO A DARKNESS SHE'D NEVER ESCAPE. YOU KNOW WHO MY FATHER IS. YOU KNOW THAT IF I TOLD HIM WHAT I KNOW ABOUT YOU... I COULD GET YOU IN SO MUCH TROUBLE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? TELL HIM WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT. CHARLIE FELT LIKE HE HAD TO ELIMINATE HER. [ BOTH SCREAMING INDISTINCTLY ] Dupnik: HE ALLEGEDLY GOT THE GUITAR STRING FROM HIS GUITAR AND USED IT TO CHOKE HER TO DEATH... AND THEN HE WENT AND GOT WENDY AND DID THE SAME THING TO HER. AND POOR WENDY -- SHE WAS ONLY 13. SHE JUST HAPPENED TO BE WITH HER BIG SISTER THAT NIGHT, WHEN THAT LAST AWFUL FIGHT HAPPENED. Dupnik: HE THEN PUT THEM IN THE TRUNK OF HIS AUTOMOBILE AND TOOK THEM OUT TO THIS DESERT AREA IN THE FOOTHILLS OF TUCSON. McNamara: AND THEN HE CAME BACK, AND HE DROVE GRETCHEN'S CAR AND LEFT IT AT THE FLAMINGO HOTEL. YEAH, THAT'S HER, RIGHT THERE. SMITTY TOOK ME UP HERE, SAID WE HAD TO MOVE THE BODIES. RICHIE EXPLAINS TO THE POLICE THAT ABOUT THREE WEEKS AFTER THE FRITZ GIRLS WENT MISSING... RIGHT HERE. RIGHT HERE. ...CHARLIE TOOK HIM OUT TO THE DESERT TO SHOW HIM WHERE THE BODIES WERE. THAT'S GRETCHEN? YEAH. HE HELPED SCHMID DRAG THEM OUT TO THE BURIAL SPOT. YOU KNOW, RICH... IT'S BETWEEN YOU AND ME NOW. YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING. HE WAS QUITE AFRAID OF SCHMID. McNamara: POLICE HAD MADE A DEAL WITH RICHIE THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR THIS INFORMATION, HE WILL NOT BE CHARGED. CHARLIE WANTED ME TO CALL ALLEEN, SO I DID. IT WAS ALL CHARLIE'S IDEA. McNamara: IN EXCHANGE FOR REDUCED SENTENCING, MARY FRENCH AND JOHN SAUNDERS AGREE TO TESTIFY AGAINST CHARLIE SCHMID. Dupnik: ON THE 10th OF NOVEMBER, LIEUTENANT ROBLES AND I PLACED HIM UNDER ARREST. AT THAT POINT, HE WAS A DIFFERENT CHARLIE SCHMID. HIS BEHAVIOR IS VERY BIZARRE. HE STUNK. HE WAS FILTHY. Marsh: HE WORE PANCAKE MAKEUP. HE WORE REALLY HEAVY COATS OF CHAP STICK ON HIS LIPS. HE WORE A BANDAGE ACROSS HIS NOSE, AS IF HE HAD BEEN IN SOME SORT OF FIGHT. AND HE HAD A BEAUTY MARK ON HIS FACE THAT HE ACCENTUATED WITH THIS BLACK, GREASY STUFF. HE SEEMED TO BELIEVE THAT HE LOOKED LIKE ELVIS PRESLEY. Dupnik: HE JUST WOULDN'T TALK TO US. HE WAS IN ALMOST LIKE A TRANCE. AT THAT POINT, HE WAS PROBABLY ON THE VERGE OF CRACKING UP. CHARLIE HAD JUST BEEN PLAYING AT THE "BITCHIN' SMITTY" CHARACTER ALL ALONG, BUT NOW IT WAS OVER. HE LOOKED LIKE SOME KIND OF GROTESQUE CLOWN. BUT IT WASN'T FUNNY FOR ANY OF US. IT FELT MORE LIKE WE'D BEEN DANCING WITH THE DEVIL. Marsh: HE WAS SO GOOD AT BEING PHONY. Schafer: HE HAD RECORDINGS OF ONE OF THE GOOD GUITAR PLAYERS IN TOWN. Marsh: AND THEN HE PUT THE TAPE RECORDER UNDER A CABINET THAT HE HAD MADE. Schafer: BUT HE WASN'T PLAYING AT ALL. ALL THE THINGS THAT CHARLIE DID, WHEN YOU STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THEM TODAY, WE'D CALL HIM A PSYCHOPATH. BUT IN 1965, THAT WASN'T THE KIND OF MONSTER ANYBODY KNEW ABOUT YET. Marsh: PEOPLE WHO ARE PSYCHOPATHIC, IN MANY CASES, SEEM MORE ALIVE, MORE CHARISMATIC, MORE INTERESTING. BUT THAT MASK CONCEALS A REAL INNER DEADNESS, WHERE HE WAS A GRANDIOSE NARCISSIST AT THE CENTER OF THINGS WHO WAS ABLE TO MANIPULATE TEENAGERS WHO WERE LOOKING FOR GUIDANCE. THAT WAS THE MOST AMAZING PART OF IT ALL, THAT THIS GUY -- CHARMING, YES, EXCITING, SURE, BUT STILL JUST A GUY -- GOT A GROUP OF KIDS TO STAND BY WHILE HE KILLED THREE PEOPLE AND GOT AWAY WITH IT. Marsh: HE EVEN HAD THE NICKNAME "THE PIED PIPER OF TUCSON." Schafer: YOU EXPECT AT SOME POINT, SOMEBODY'S CONSCIENCE IS GONNA SAY, "NO, I'VE GOT TO TELL WHAT I KNOW." NOBODY SAID ANYTHING, NOTHING. IT'S A BETTER STORY TO SAY THERE WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE ABOUT OUR CROWD OUT ON SPEEDWAY, THAT WE WERE BAD KIDS, BUT THE TRUTH MIGHT BE SCARIER. THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON IN TUCSON THAT COULDN'T HAPPEN ANYWHERE. ADOLESCENCE IS THE TIME PERIOD THE PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT GOVERN REWARD SEEKING AND CURIOUSLY ARE REALLY ACTIVE. HOWEVER, THE PREFRONTAL PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT GOVERN IMPULSE CONTROL ARE UNDERDEVELOPED, AND THAT CREATES TROUBLE. THE PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF VIOLENCE ARE OFTEN THOSE THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF ADOLESCENTS. WE ALL DO CRAZY THINGS GROWING UP. I BET YOU DID, TOO. GRETCHEN FRITZ WAS JUST DATING BOYS AND HAVING DRAMAS WITH HER FRIENDS. FOR TEENAGERS, CRAZY IS NORMAL, AND THAT'S ALL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN... IF A PIED PIPER HADN'T COME AND PLAYED HIS SONG IN OUR TOWN. [ "HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN" PLAYS ] * THERE IS A HOUSE IN NEW ORLEANS * * THEY CALL THE RISING SUN * * AND IT'S BEEN THE RUIN OF MANY A POOR BOY * * AND ME, OH, GOD, I'M ONE *
