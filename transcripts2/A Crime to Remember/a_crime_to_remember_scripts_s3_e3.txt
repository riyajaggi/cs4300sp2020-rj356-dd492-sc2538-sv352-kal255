 GIRLS WHO LIVED ACROSS THE STREET WERE SMART AND PRETTY AND REALLY NICE. THEY WERE CLUB LEADERS AND STAR STUDENTS, AND THEY HARDLY EVER GOT INTO TROUBLE WITH CURFEW. SO WE NEVER HAD ANY REASON TO THINK THAT ON THAT JULY MORNING, THEY WEREN'T SLEEPING SOUNDLY IN THEIR BEDS. BUT CORA AMURAO HAD NOT SLEPT AT ALL. SHE HAD LIVED THROUGH A NIGHT DARKER THAN YOU OR I WILL EVER KNOW. AND WHEN SHE DID GET UP THAT MORNING,

 SHE MUST HAVE BEEN PRAYING THAT IT HAD ALL BEEN SOME KIND OF NIGHTMARE, THAT WHAT SHE HAD ENDURED COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE REAL. HELP! SOMEONE, HELP, PLEASE! SOMEONE, HELP, PLEASE! ** CHICAGO IN THE SUMMER OF '66 WAS THE SORT OF HOT THAT CREEPS IN UNDER YOUR SKIN. AND IT WASN'T JUST THE WEATHER. THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK THAT SUMMER OF CIVIL RIGHTS. EVERYONE WAS PRETTY WORKED UP. THE MOVEMENT HAD GATHERED MOMENTUM DOWN SOUTH. AND WITH THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT BECOMING LAW JUST 2 YEARS EARLIER,

 CHANGES WERE CLIMBING UP NORTH TO PLACES LIKE CHICAGO. YOU'D THINK THEY WOULD HAVE HAD AN EASIER TIME UP HERE, BUT YOU'D BE WRONG. RIOTS WERE STARTING TO BREAK OUT. SO IT WOULD HAVE SHOCKED ME TO NO END TO FIND OUT THAT THE MOST TERRIBLE VIOLENCE THAT SUMMER WOULD HAPPEN RIGHT IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD. JEFFERY MANOR WAS A QUIET AREA AT THE EDGE OF THE CITY. YOU NEVER EXPECTED TO LOOK OUT YOUR WINDOW AND SEE A CRIME SCENE. THE FIRST HOMICIDE DETECTIVE ON THE SCENE, JACK WALLENDA, WALKS IN TO THE TOWN HOUSE. ** AND ALL HE CAN SEE ARE BLOOD AND GIRLS. HE'S NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. THERE ARE FIVE LACERATIONS, ALL WITHIN A 6-INCH AREA. YOU HAVE EIGHT VICTIMS. THEY'D BEEN STABBED, STRANGLED. AND THIS ONE IS STABBED IN THE EYE. IN THE LIVING ROOM IS A NUDE YOUNG WOMAN. IT APPEARS THAT SHE HAS BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. THE VICTIM'S WRISTS ARE BOUND. AND THEY WERE TIED VERY PROFESSIONALLY AND TIGHTLY. IT'S A COMPLETE SCENE OF CARNAGE AND MAYHEM. THIS HAD TO HAVE BEEN AT LEAST TWO OR THREE PERPS. THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF SPECULATION WHO POSSIBLY COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SUCH A GRUESOME FEAT. IS IT A GANG OF DRUG-CRAZED KILLERS? THERE IS A SCREEN OFF A WINDOW IN THE REAR OF THE TOWN HOUSE. ALSO BECAUSE OF THE RIOTS AND THE GENERAL SENSE OF TENSION BETWEEN BLACKS AND WHITES, THERE IS SOME GRUMBLING OF, "WERE THESE A GANG OF BLACKS WHO MIGHT'VE BROKEN INTO THIS TOWN HOUSE AND KILLED THESE EIGHT STUDENT NURSES?" THE CRIME LAB TECHNICIANS ARE BEGINNING THE PROCESS OF LIFTING FINGERPRINTS. THERE IS A BLOODY T-SHIRT, WHICH DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT WOULD BELONG TO THE NURSES. BUT IN TERMS OF CLUES, THERE ARE VERY FEW. ** WHEN YOU WORK IN A HOSPITAL, DEATH BECOMES A PART OF YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE. BUT IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN IT HAPPENS LIKE THIS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S SOMEONE YOU KNOW. ALL THE TRAINING IN THE WORLD CAN'T PREPARE YOU FOR THAT FEELING. YOUR BODY GOES NUMB, AND YOUR MIND FLIPS THROUGH EVERYTHING YOU KNEW ABOUT THE PERSON, AS THOUGH REMEMBERING ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS MIGHT HELP YOU HOLD ON TO THEM. NINA SCHMALE WAS MAYBE THE MOST POPULAR GIRL IN OUR CLASS. AND GLORIA DAVY WAS REALLY ACCOMPLISHED. SHE WAS HEAD OF THE STUDENT NURSES ASSOCIATION. AND PAMELA WILKENING, WE ALL CALLED HER WILLY. I WISH I HAD GOTTEN TO KNOW THEM BETTER. AND NOW ALL I HAD WAS REGRET. BUT THAT'S WHY WE WERE SO THANKFUL TO HEAR THAT SOMEONE HAD SURVIVED. CORA AMURAO WAS NEW AT SCHOOL. SHE'D ONLY MOVED TO CHICAGO FROM THE PHILIPPINES 2 MONTHS BEFORE. SHE SEEMED SWEET AND A LITTLE SHY. THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A LIVING EYE WITNESS CAN'T BE OVERSTATED. THE INVESTIGATORS NEED TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION FROM HER AS THEY CAN, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ** CORA. CORA. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED? CORA IS TERRIFIED. SHE STARTS TO REVERT TO HER NATIVE TAGALOG. SHE'S HORRIBLY TRAUMATIZED BY WHAT SHE HAS WITNESSED. SO SHE HAS TO BE SEDATED. FINALLY, CORA CALMS DOWN. AND AT THAT POINT, SHE SAYS, "I REALLY WANT TO HELP." LAST NIGHT, I WENT TO BED AT 10:30. HALF HOUR LATER, I HEARD A KNOCK. I ANSWERED THE DOOR. WHO WAS AT THE DOOR? HOW MANY MEN? ONE MAN. YOU'RE SAYING THAT ONE MAN DID THIS? YES, TALL, 6 FEET, BLOND HAIR. YES. THEY FIND THIS SHOCKING. A SINGLE MAN KILLED EIGHT WOMEN. WHAT ELSE IS HE CAPABLE OF? WHOEVER HAD THE ABILITY TO DO THIS WILL VERY LIKELY STRIKE AGAIN. ** ONE -- ONE QUESTION AT A TIME. EIGHT NURSES HAVE BEEN KILLED IN ONE NIGHT WITH SEXUAL OVERTONES. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE -- WE'RE LOOKING AT A COMBINATION OF STABBING AND STRANGULATION. WHAT WAS THE MOTIVE? WE DON'T KNOW. THERE IS A SENSE OF INCOMPREHENSION. THE POLICE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE KILLER IS ONLY ONE MAN. AND EVERYBODY IS JUST TOTALLY ASTONISHED AT HOW HE COULD HAVE DONE THIS. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED. IT'S THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY. ARE THERE ANY SURVIVORS? THERE'S ONE SURVIVOR. FROM CORA, THE SURVIVING NURSE, THEY DID HAVE A DESCRIPTION. A WHITE MALE, APPROXIMATELY 25 YEARS OF AGE, 6 FEET TALL, BLOND HAIR, WITH A SOUTHERN DRAWL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, GUYS. LISTEN UP. I WANT YOU TO COVER THE ENTIRE AREA. THEY HAVE A MASS MURDERER ON THEIR HANDS WHO HAS A HEAD START OF SEVERAL HOURS. ALL RIGHT. BURGLARY, YOU'RE GONNA COVER THIS. THERE'S A CONSIDERABLE SENSE OF URGENCY TO USE AS MUCH MANPOWER AS POSSIBLE. SO BURGLARY DETECTIVES WERE PUT ON THE CASE IN ADDITION TO THE HOMICIDE DETECTIVES. I DON'T WANT ANY STONE LEFT UNTURNED. OKAY? - YOU GOT IT. THE BURGLARY DETECTIVES WERE VERY STREET WISE. THEY KNEW EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY. THEY KNEW HOW TO GET INFORMATION. HEY, FELLA. I'M A FRIEND OF YOUR MANAGER. HOW ARE YOU TODAY? A BURGLARY DETECTIVE NAMED EDDIE WIELOSINSKI LIVES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND HE KNOWS IT LIKE THE BACK OF HIS HANDS. WE'RE ACTUALLY CANVASSING THE AREA. HE GOES TO A GAS STATION, AND HE TALKS TO THE GAS STATION ATTENDANT. THE STATION IS A GATHERING POINT FOR TRANSIENT PEOPLE AND TROUBLEMAKERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A WHITE MALE. AND HE GIVES CORA'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SUSPECT. WELL, I -- I GUESS THERE WAS, ONE GUY. THE ATTENDANT SAYS, "WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO SOUNDS LIKE THAT. HE WAS VERY AGITATED AND A LITTLE BELLIGERENT." ANY WAY YOU COULD IDENTIFY HIM? THE -- THE TATTOOS, FOR SURE. HE HAD, - WHAT WAS IT? BORN TO RAISE HELL. IT WAS, RIGHT HERE, THE LEFT ARM. DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE? MAYBE IT WAS THAT HE HAD TO BE SOMEWHERE 'CAUSE HE SAID HE WAS, LIKE, SHIPPIN' OUT TO NEW ORLEANS. HE SAID HE WAS TAKING A SHIP FROM SOMEWHERE? YEAH, YEAH. WIELOSINSKI HAD BEEN A MERCHANT SAILOR AT ONE TIME. AND HE REMEMBERED THE KNOTS THE GIRLS WERE TIED WITH. WIELOSINSKI REALIZES THE SUSPECT COULD BE A SAILOR. INVESTIGATORS GO TO THE SEAMAN'S UNION HALL, WHICH IS ADJACENT TO THE TOWNHOME IN WHICH THE GIRLS WERE KILLED. SIR, WE'RE LOOKING FOR A WHITE MALE, TATTOOS. HE MENTIONS THE SAILOR'S BELLIGERENT ATTITUDE WITH THE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SHIP. ANYBODY LIKE THAT COME TO MIND? UM, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS ONE GUY. HE SAYS, "WAIT A MINUTE. THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE THAT WAS IN HERE A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO." AND HE REACHES DOWN INTO THE WASTE BASKET... ...AND PULLS OUT THIS ASSIGNMENT SLIP, WHICH SENT THIS SAILOR TO A SHIP CALLED THE SINCLAIR GREAT LAKES FOR A JOB. BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE BERTH FOR TWO SAILORS, AND THE JOB WENT TO A SAILOR WITH MORE SENIORITY. SO THIS GUY CAME BACK AND RAISED HELL AT THE UNION HALL. RICHARD SPECK. DO YOU HAVE A PHONE THAT WE COULD USE? FORTUNATELY, THE ASSIGNMENT SLIP HAS THIS GUY RICHARD SPECK'S NEAREST POINT OF CONTACT, WHICH IS HIS SISTER, WHO LIVES IN CHICAGO. POLICE KNOW THAT THIS RICHARD SPECK WANTS A JOB ABOARD A SHIP. SO THEY DECIDE TO ENTRAP HIM. THIS IS MR. OLSEN FROM THE NATIONAL MARITIME UNION. YES, WE HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT FOR RICHARD SPECK. IS HE THERE? WELL, COULD YOU ALERT HIM AND HAVE HIM CALL US, PLEASE? THANK YOU. NOW, WE WAIT. THAT'S WHAT WE DO. PRAY TO MARY THAT HE CALLS. CORA, CAN YOU -- CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE? MEANWHILE, AT THE HOSPITAL, DETECTIVES WERE WORKING WITH CORA TO GENTLY COAX A PORTRAIT OF THE KILLER FROM HER. CORA. CORA, CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT HIS EYES? HE HAD LIGHT EYES, BLUE -- BLUE EYES. SKINNY MAN, HAIR BLOND. JUST A FEW HOURS IN, THE INVESTIGATION WAS MOVING FORWARD ALL OVER THE CITY, FROM CORA'S HOSPITAL ROOM TO A DIVE BAR CALLED THE SHIPYARD INN. AND THOUGH THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT AT THE TIME, THE POLICE WERE BEGINNING TO CONVERGE... HEY. YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW CALLED, SAID CALL THE UNION HALL. THEY GOT A JOB FOR YOU. ...COMING TO THE TRUTH FROM TWO SIDES. THANK YOU. MARITIME UNION HALL. YEAH, THIS IS RICHARD SPECK. Yes, Mr. Speck. WE HAVE A SHIP FOR YOU. WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE SHIP? IT IS THE SINCLAIR GREAT LAKES. SINCLAIR GREAT LAKES? HIS CHEEK BONES? - HIGHER. - HIGH CHEEK BONES. - YES. - ALL RIGHT. DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THE MOUTH? LIPS OUT A LITTLE, NOT TOO MUCH. WHAT ABOUT THE NOSE? DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT HIS NOSE? NOSE, LONG, BIG. NO, NO, NO. OKAY. DON'T GIVE THAT AWAY TO ANYONE ELSE. I'LL BE THERE. WE'LL HOLD THE ASSIGNMENT OPEN FOR YOU UNTIL YOU GET ON OVER HERE. BUT, UM, WE CLOSE AT 5:00 P.M. YEAH, BEFORE 5:00. YOU GOT IT. - WHAT DID HE SAY? - HE'LL BE HERE. AND SO WILL WE. BUT THERE'S A REAL DANGER IN DRAWING CLOSE TO AN ANIMAL. DOES THIS LOOK LIKE THE MAN? IF IT KNOWS IT IS CORNERED... YES. IT MIGHT DO ANYTHING. THEY TOLD US AT SCHOOL TO TRY TO GO ABOUT OUR DAY AS USUAL, THAT THE BEST THING WE COULD DO WAS TRY TO FIND A SENSE OF NORMALCY. NORMALCY? THE NIGHT BEFORE, EIGHT OF MY CLASSMATES HAD BEEN TORTURED AND MURDERED RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM ME. HOW COULD ANYTHING BE NORMAL AGAIN? PAT MATUSEK WOULD NEVER WIN ANOTHER SWIM CHAMPIONSHIP. I WOULD NEVER SMELL MERLITA'S COOKING WAFTING IN THROUGH THE WINDOW. SUZANNE FARRIS WOULD NEVER CRACK ANOTHER JOKE. AND CORA... WOULD WE EVER SEE THAT SMILE AGAIN? WHO COULD DO THIS TO THEM? EVERY HOUR, I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK, WONDERING, HAD THEY FOUND HIM YET? WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW IT RIGHT THEN, BUT JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE HOSPITAL, RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM WHERE WE LIVED, THE POLICE WERE SETTING A TRAP FOR A SAILOR NAMED RICHARD SPECK. THEY HAVE MANAGED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH HIM. THEY'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT HE'S GOING TO SHOW UP. - BRUIN? - HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE, FLANKING THAT DOOR. ALEX, STAND RIGHT ON OVER HERE. YOU'RE GONNA BE RIGHT ACROSS FROM ME. STEVE, RIGHT OVER THERE BY THE RADIATOR. THIS IS WHAT WOULD NOW BE CALLED A STING OPERATION. PROTOCOL IS, IF YOU CAN GET HIM TO COME THERE, YOU TAKE UP A POSITION. AND WHEN HE COMES IN, YOU GRAB HIM BEFORE HE CAN WHIP OUT A GUN OR A KNIFE. THE STING IS ONE ASPECT OF IT. IN THE MEANTIME, THEY ALSO HAD TWO-MAN TEAMS WHO WERE FANNING OUT. THEY'RE HITTING LOCAL HOTELS AND BARS AND RESTAURANTS. EVERYTHING WAS HAPPENING REALLY QUICKLY THAT DAY. POLICE WERE EVERYWHERE. AND THESE POLICEMEN HAD ONLY RECENTLY LEFT THE CRIME SCENE. HEY, MAC? YEAH? WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR A GUY. THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PICTURE OF THE SUSPECT. HE'S A SAILOR, BLOND HAIR, 24 OR 25 YEARS OLD. ALL THEY HAD WAS A VAGUE DESCRIPTION. THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE NAME, RICHARD SPECK. BUT HE WAS CLOSER THAN THEY COULD'VE IMAGINED. DON'T RING A BELL. RICHARD SPECK IS STANDING 10 FEET AWAY. HEY, MAC? LET'S HEAR YOUR STORY. WHERE DO YOU WORK? DOWN THE SHIPYARD. HOW 'BOUT YOU? SHIPYARD. SPECK SLINKS AWAY AND GOES OUT THE BACK DOOR. IN THE MEANTIME, AT THE UNION HALL, THE DAY DRAGS ON, AND RICHARD SPECK DOES NOT SHOW UP. YOU TOLD HIM THAT THE NAME OF THE SHIP HE WAS GOIN' ON WAS THE SINCLAIR GREAT LAKES, YEAH? YES. THAT WAS THE SHIP THAT ALREADY LEFT. SPECK MUST HAVE KNOWN HE WAS BEING SET UP. HE'S NOT COMING. THE DRAGNET MISSED HIM. THEY'RE AFRAID RICHARD SPECK MAY GET AWAY. YEAH? WHAT'S THE STATUS WITH THE PRINTS? AT THE SAME TIME, THE POLICE THINK THE THREE FINGERPRINTS FROM THE CRIME SCENE... - BEAUTIFUL. - ...BELONG TO THE KILLER. IF THIS RICHARD SPECK'S FINGERPRINTS MATCHED THE PRINTS FROM THE CRIME SCENE, THEY HAD THEIR MAN. THEY RUN A CHECK OF CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT RECORDS. AND RICHARD SPECK IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. SO THEY CALL THE FBI IN WASHINGTON D.C. TO CHECK IF THEY HAD ANYTHING ON FILE. AND THEY PULL OUT RICHARD SPECK'S FINGERPRINT CARDS. FROM HIS ARREST RECORD IN TEXAS. BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, THIS WAS 1966. THIS WAS LONG BEFORE E-MAIL OR FAX MACHINES. THE FINGERPRINT FILE FROM THE FBI HAD TO BE PHYSICALLY TRANSPORTED FROM D.C. TO CHICAGO. AND AS IF THAT WASN'T HARD ENOUGH... AMONG THE MANY CHALLENGES THE DEPARTMENT FACED, THERE WAS AN AIRLINE STRIKE GOING ON ACROSS THE NATION. THE ENTIRE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT IS FEELING TREMENDOUS PRESSURE TO FIND THEIR MAN AND TO NAIL THIS THING DOWN. A SUSPECT ON THE LOOSE FOR 12 HOURS -- THAT'S A PROBLEM. EVERY SECOND THAT TICKED BY TOOK THE POLICE FURTHER AWAY FROM CATCHING THE MONSTER. AND A MANHUNT IN A CITY AS BIG AS CHICAGO IS NO JOKE. BUT THAT WEEK, FORGET ABOUT IT. THE RIOTS HAD SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL. SIX POLICEMEN WERE SHOT. OVER 100 PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED. WE COULD BARELY HANDLE THE PATIENTS IN OUR EMERGENCY ROOM. OF COURSE, IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND THE GUY OUT THERE IN ALL THAT CHAOS. AND BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM, THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT IS BEING STRETCHED VERY THIN. AT THE SAME TIME, ON THE NORTH SIDE, NEAR THE OLD TOWN SECTION OF CHICAGO, THESE BEAT COPS ARE CALLED TO THE RALEIGH HOTEL ON A ROUTINE CASE. THEY HAVE THIS TIP THAT A MAN IN ROOM 806 HAS A GUN. THEY KNOW THE ROOM IS REGISTERED TO A MAN NAMED DAVID STATEN. HEY, BUDDY. WAKE UP. GOOD MORNING, OFFICERS. LET'S SEE YOUR I.D. YEAH. RICHARD SPECK? RICHARD SPECK? LOOK, BUDDY. WANT TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU'RE REGISTERED DOWNSTAIRS WITH ONE NAME, AND THE NAME ON YOUR I.D. HERE IS DIFFERENT? ALL RIGHT. BEAR WITH ME, NOW. I KNOW THIS SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TODAY. SO MANY THINGS WERE HAPPENING AT ONCE, AND THE RIOTS DIDN'T HELP. THESE WERE JUST REGULAR BEAT COPS. THEY WEREN'T EVEN A PART OF THE MANHUNT. SO THEY JUST DIDN'T KNOW THEY SHOULD BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SOMEONE NAMED RICHARD SPECK. THAT'S -- THAT'S NOT MINE. THAT'S THIS -- THAT'S THIS LADY'S I PICKED UP LAST NIGHT. I'LL BE HONEST. SHE WAS -- SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE. AND I THINK SHE SAID IT WAS FOR PROTECTION. BUT THAT'S HER GUN. SHE LEFT IT HERE. I WANT NO PART OF IT. ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE'RE CONFISCATING IT ANYWAY. KEEP YOUR NOSE CLEAN. YES, SIR. THANK YOU, SIR. IF THEY'D HAVE BROUGHT HIM IN AND CHARGED HIM WITH HAVING THE GUN, THEY'D HAVE HAD HIM IN CUSTODY. HINDSIGHT IS 20/20, RIGHT? INSTEAD OF NABBING THE MOST WANTED MAN IN AMERICA, THEY JUST LEFT HIM THERE. AFTER THAT CLOSE CALL, HE MUST HAVE WISENED UP BECAUSE BY THE TIME THE MANHUNT REACHED THE HOTEL, THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT FOR THEM TO FIND. SPECK REALIZES THAT THE WOLVES ARE CLOSING IN AND THAT HE SHOULD FLEE. THE POLICE NOW RUN THE RISK OF LOSING HIM FOREVER. THIS RICHARD SPECK HAD SKIPPED OUT ON A JOB OFFER AT THE UNION HALL AND VANISHED IMMEDIATELY FROM THE HOTEL. THAT SURE SOUNDS LIKE GUILTY BEHAVIOR TO ME. AND THE POLICE THOUGHT SO, TOO. BUT WITHOUT ANY HARD EVIDENCE, THEY WERE IN A REAL BIND. LOOK, JUST PUT HIS PHOTO IN THE PAPER SO PEOPLE CAN SEE HIS FACE. WE PUT A PICTURE OF SPECK IN THE PAPER, AND WE RISK BLOWING THIS WHOLE TRIAL. JACK, THE PRESS IS GONNA LINE UP TO HELP US CATCH THIS GUY. FORGET THE LAWYERS. WE CAN'T GO PUBLIC WITH A PHOTO NOW. SOME FANCY DEFENSE ATTORNEY'LL SAY THE JURY POOL WAS POISONED, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, AND THIS GUY WALKS. YOU WANT THAT? SINCE THEY DON'T YET HAVE POSITIVE PROOF THAT SPECK IS THE KILLER, IF THEY WERE TO GIVE HIS PHOTOGRAPH TO THE NEWSPAPERS AND NAME HIM AS THE MURDERER, THEN SPECK MIGHT VERY WELL GET OFF ON A TECHNICALITY. UNTIL WE CAN MATCH HIS FINGERPRINTS FROM THE CRIME SCENE WITH THE PRINTS THAT THE FBI IS SENDING US, WE GOT TO WAIT. AIR TRAVEL WAS A LITTLE EXOTIC BACK THEN. I'D NEVER EVEN BEEN ON AN AIRPLANE. IT STILL SEEMED A LITTLE BIT LIKE MAGIC. SO IT MADE A KIND OF SENSE WHEN THE BREAK THE POLICE NEEDED CAME FROM ABOVE. STRIKE OR NO STRIKE, AN AMERICAN AIRLINES PILOT VOLUNTEERED TO FLY RICHARD SPECK'S FINGERPRINTS TO CHICAGO ON THE JUMP SEAT. ** SO THE FINGERPRINTS HAD TO BE MATCHED, BUT IT WAS A VERY METICULOUS PROCESS. ANYBODY COME THROUGH HERE LIKE THAT? I DON'T KNOW. YOU COULDN'T GO ANYWHERE IN CHICAGO THAT DAY WITHOUT SEEING POLICE, ESPECIALLY ON THE NORTH SIDE WHERE THE MANHUNT HAD SPREAD. WE DIDN'T KNOW IT, BUT THEY WERE JUST SPINNING THEIR WHEELS. RICHARD SPECK MADE SURE TO BLEND IN WITH THE VAGRANTS ON SKID ROW WHILE HE FIGURED OUT HOW TO SKIP TOWN. AND SPECK HAS GOTTEN THE IDEA, HE'S GOING TO GET ON A FREIGHT AND GO DOWN TO DALLAS. I CAN REMEMBER THINKING, "IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME WAY I COULD HELP." THE FUNNY THING WAS, THAT'S WHAT THE POLICE WERE THINKING TOO. IF THEY COULD JUST MATCH SPECK'S PRINTS AND PUT HIS PICTURE IN THE PAPER, THEN ALL OF CHICAGO COULD BE ON THE LOOKOUT. AND THE DAY WEARS ON. EVENTUALLY, IT GETS TO BE ABOUT 5:00 A.M. THEY'RE BLURRY EYED. HUGHEY, THIS ONE LOOKS VERY GOOD. YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. - Yeah? - I THINK WE HAVE A MATCH. GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE AN ALL-POINT ALERT OUT FOR RICHARD SPECK. NEWSPAPERS WERE PROVIDED WITH THE MUGSHOTS AND THE DESCRIPTION. INCLUDING THE EMBLEMATIC TATTOO, "BORN TO RAISE HELL," ON THE LEFT ARM. LET'S GET THE WORD OUT, FOLKS. WE'RE GONNA CATCH THIS SON OF A GUN. POLICE ARE SEEKING THE PUBLIC'S HELP IN THE CASE OF THE EIGHT STUDENT NURSES BRUTALLY MURDERED ON CHICAGO'S SOUTH SIDE. THE KILLER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE RICHARD SPECK, A TEXAS NATIVE. MR. SPECK'S WHEREABOUTS ARE CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. RICHARD SPECK MIGHT BE DISCOVERED BY SOME CITIZEN AND THE INFORMATION RELATING TO HIS ACTIVITIES REPORTED TO US. HEY, BUDDY. SEEN THIS GUY? THERE ARE POLICE EVERYWHERE. THEY'RE HITTING EVERY BAR, EVERY PLACE THEY CAN FIND. THEY'RE SHOWING SPECK'S PHOTO. THEY KNOW THEY'RE CLOSING IN. IN THE MEANTIME, SPECK RENTS A CUBICLE FOR 90 CENTS IN THE STARR HOTEL. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING, "WHY DIDN'T THE GUY SKIP TOWN?" THE POLICE WERE WATCHING THE TRAINS TOO CLOSELY. SPECK HAD NO MONEY. THE INVESTIGATORS WERE CLOSING IN ON HIM. HE WAS CORNERED. THAT AFTERNOON ACROSS CHICAGO, DR. LEROY SMITH IS TOWARD THE END OF A 36-HOUR SHIFT IN THE SAME HOSPITAL WHERE, BELOW, IN THE MORGUE, THE NURSES HAD BEEN TAKEN. DOCTOR, WE HAVE A WRIST-CUTTER IN, CURTAIN THREE. THANK YOU, CATHY. DR. SMITH IS ASSIGNED A CASE OF AN ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. BUT IT WAS A WEAK ATTEMPT AT SUICIDE. LET'S GO AHEAD AND CLEAN HIM UP. ** HE REALIZES THIS IS RICHARD SPECK. WATER. WATER. DID YOU GIVE THE NURSES WATER? WATER. IT FELT, TO MANY OF US IN CHICAGO, LIKE AN ETERNITY. BUT IT TOOK ONLY 72 HOURS AFTER THE MURDERS FOR THE POLICE TO CAPTURE RICHARD SPECK. THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAITED FOR THE TRIAL FOR 7 ANXIOUS MONTHS. WE NEEDED ANSWERS. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN THE TOWN HOUSE THAT NIGHT? HOW WAS A SINGLE MAN ABLE TO KILL EIGHT WOMEN, ONE BY ONE, SO SILENTLY THAT NO ONE EVER HEARD THEM SCREAM? CORA, THE SURVIVING NURSE, HASN'T BEEN SEEN FOR 7 MONTHS NOW. THERE WERE RUMORS THAT SHE'D GONE BACK TO THE PHILIPPINES, THAT SHE'D BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH ALREADY, AND HAD NO INTENTION OF TESTIFYING. NOBODY KNOWS WHERE CORA IS. NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW THE MURDERS OCCURRED. BUT AT 11:00 A.M. ON THE THIRD DAY OF THE TRIAL, CORA WAS USHERED PAST THE PRESS THROUGH THE SIDE DOOR. CORAZON AMURAO. ** AS IT TURNS OUT, THEY HAD PUT HER IN THE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM. WOULD YOU PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME? CORAZON AMURAO. THE PROSECUTION WAS AFRAID THAT SHE WAS SO FRAGILE, PSYCHOLOGICALLY, THAT SHE MIGHT JUST BREAK DOWN AND MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO TESTIFY. CORA, CAN YOU CONFIRM THIS IS A REPLICA OF THE TOWN HOUSE AT 2319 EAST 100th STREET? THAT IS THE SAME. WHAT TIME DID YOU GO TO SLEEP ON JULY 13th? AT 10:30 P.M. DID YOU WAKE UP AT ANY TIME LATER THAT NIGHT? YES. I HEARD A KNOCK IN OUR BEDROOM AT ABOUT 11:00. I GOT UP, AND I ANSWERED THE DOOR. AND I SAW A MAN WITH A GUN IN HIS RIGHT HAND. HE TOOK US TO THE REAR BEDROOM. HE LEADS THEM TO A BACK, LARGE BEDROOM, WHERE OTHER NURSES ARE SLEEPING. AND HE TOLD US TO SIT DOWN. THAT'S RIGHT. NO ONE'S GOING TO GET HURT. JUST DO WHAT I SAY. OKAY. GOOD. HERE'S THE DEAL. I NEED MONEY TO GET TO NEW ORLEANS. WHO'S GOT MONEY IN THEIR ROOM? RAISE YOUR HANDS. OKAY. OKAY. THE AMERICAN GIRLS SEEMED TO THINK WE SHOULD DO WHAT HE SAYS AND THAT HE WILL GO AWAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHAT ABOUT YOU TWO? BUT THE FILIPINO GIRLS WANTED TO TACKLE THIS MAN RIGHT FROM THE START. CORAZON SAID SHE HAD SEEN THIS TYPE OF PERSON IN THE BACKCOUNTRY OF THE PHILIPPINES WHERE SHE GREW UP. THANK YOU. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THEY EMPTY THEIR PURSES, GIVE HIM EVERYTHING, YET HE DOESN'T LEAVE. WHAT HAPPENED THEN? HE STOOD AND TOOK BEDSHEETS FROM MISS MATUSEK'S BED. IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE TRIAL, I LAY AWAKE AT NIGHT WONDERING, "COULDN'T THEY SENSE WHAT HE WANTED TO DO TO THEM? WHY DIDN'T THEY RUN OR SCREAM FOR HELP? HOW COULD HE OVERPOWER EIGHT PEOPLE?" THE ANSWER CORA GAVE HAS HAUNTED ME FOR 50 YEARS. WOULD YOU PLEASE TURN AROUND FOR ME? HE SIMPLY ASKED FOR THEIR PERMISSION. HE BEGINS TO TIE THE NURSES UP, ONE BY ONE. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. THERE'S SIX OF US. WILL YOU PLEASE TURN AROUND? THIS IS THEIR FINAL CHANCE, REALLY, TO MAKE A MOVE. DID YOU TRY TO STOP HIM AT ANY TIME? NO. IF THEY'D ATTACK HIM OR SCATTERED, THEY'D RUN OUT THE DOORS AND BEGIN SCREAMING, MOST OF THEM WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS IN THE MOMENT, WHEN DEEP IN YOUR GUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS WRONG, BUT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT WOULD MAKE THE SITUATION REAL. I THINK THEY THOUGHT, IF THEY IGNORED THAT GUT INSTINCT, MAYBE IT WOULD ALL JUST GO AWAY. HE TIED ALL OF US. AND HE WAS SMILING DURING THIS TIME. THEN HE UNTIED MISS WILKENING'S ANKLES, AND HE TOOK HER OUT OF THE ROOM. THEN, SUZANNE AND MARY ANN CAME HOME. THESE TWO NURSES CAME IN LATE. AND HE WAS STARTLED. WE COULDN'T SEE THEM, BUT WE HEARD A STRUGGLE. THEN IT WAS QUIET AGAIN. ONCE HE'D KILLED SUZANNE FARRIS AND MARY ANN JORDAN, HE WAS IN A FRENZY. AND IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF SYSTEMATICALLY ELIMINATING WITNESSES. WHILE SPECK IS OUT OF THE ROOM, CORA UNDERTAKES AN EFFORT TO CONCEAL HERSELF UNDER ONE OF THE BEDS. CORA IS WATCHING... ...AS HE COMES BACK AND FORTH. HER FEAR IS JUST GROWING AND GROWING. HE'S NOW GOING TO TAKE HIS EIGHTH VICTIM, GLORIA DAVY. PLEASE. AND HE PROCEEDS TO RAPE HER. AND THEN, HE TOOK MISS DAVY OUT OF THE ROOM, TOO. AND THEN CORA IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT. SPECK HAS LOST COUNT OF THE BODIES. NO ONE WOULD HAVE BLAMED HER IF SHE HAD ONLY GIVEN A WRITTEN STATEMENT AND STAYED AWAY. IF IT HAD BEEN ME, I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN BRAVE ENOUGH TO FACE HIM. BUT CORA AMURAO WAS A STRONG WOMAN, AN IMMIGRANT AND A SURVIVOR. IF YOU SEE THE MAN IN THE COURTROOM TODAY, WOULD YOU PLEASE POINT HIM OUT? AND I THINK SHE WENT THERE FOR TWO REASONS, BOTH FOR HER FALLEN FRIENDS AND BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO WALK UP TO SPECK AND LET HIM KNOW... ..."YOU DON'T SCARE ME ANYMORE." THIS IS THE MAN. CORA HAS SHOWED TOTAL COURAGE... ...THAT SHE COULD SEE SPECK AGAIN AND NAME HIM AS THE KILLER. THE JURY REQUIRED ONLY 45 MINUTES TO RETURN A VERDICT OF GUILTY, DESERVING OF DEATH. 1966 WAS SORT OF A THRESHOLD MOMENT WITH RICHARD SPECK INVADING PEOPLE'S SPACE TO COMMIT MASS MURDER. PEOPLE WERE SCRUTINIZING THEIR NEIGHBORS AND LOCKING THEIR DOORS. IT WAS KIND OF THE MURDER OF INNOCENCE. HE NOT ONLY KILLED THE EIGHT NURSES. HE KILLED A LITTLE BIT OF ALL OF US. FORGIVE OUR TRESPASSES AS WE FORGIVE THOSE WHO TRESPASS AGAINST US. AND MAYBE THE SADDEST PART OF ALL WAS THE THING THESE YOUNG WOMEN WOULD BE REMEMBERED FOR. THE THING I WOULD REMEMBER THEM FOR WAS AS A REMINDER THAT THE ONCE-GOOD WORLD HAD GONE BAD. * WILL THE CIRCLE BE UNBROKEN * * BY AND BY, LORD * * BY AND BY * AND THAT WAS ITS OWN TRAGEDY. WHAT CAN YOU LEARN ABOUT A PERSON IN THE 500 WORDS OF A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE OR IN THE 60 MINUTES OF A TELEVISION SPECIAL? IN A MASS MURDER LIKE THIS ONE, THE VICTIMS AREN'T JUST ROBBED OF THEIR LIVES. THEY'RE ROBBED OF THEIR MEMORY. BUT WE NEED TO REMEMBER ALL OF THEM, EACH AND EVERY ONE. GLORIA DAVY. PAMELA WILKENING. PATRICIA MATUSEK. MERLITA GARGULLO. SUZANNE FARRIS. NINA SCHMALE. VALENTINA PASION. AND MARY ANN JORDAN. * WILL THE CIRCLE BE UNBROKEN * * BY AND BY, LORD * * BY AND BY * * THERE'S A BETTER * * HOME AWAITIN' * * IN THE SKY, LORD * * IN THE SKY *
