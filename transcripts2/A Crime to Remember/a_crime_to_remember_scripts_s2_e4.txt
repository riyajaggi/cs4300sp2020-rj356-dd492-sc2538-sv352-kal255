 A Crime to Remember (2013–…): Season 2, Episode 4 - The 28th Floor - full transcript 
 A rain of bullets descends on students and faculty at the University of Texas. Policemen and civilians alike come together to save the wounded and put an end to the violence. But when the smoke clears, there remain more questions than answers: who could have done this evil, hideous thing, and why?

 Female student: AUGUST IN TEXAS. MY MAMA USED TO SAY, "IT GOT SO HOT, THE HENS LAID HARD-BOILED EGGS." THAT'S HOW IT WAS THAT MORNING IN 1966. IT'S FUNNY WHAT YOU REMEMBER. I WAS ON MY WAY TO HAND IN A PAPER ON "THE GREAT GATSBY." EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL, JUST LIKE IT ALWAYS HAD BEEN. IT WAS JUST REGULAR COLLEGE LIFE. [ GUNSHOTS ] DO YOU THINK THAT'S HOW IT ALWAYS SEEMS IN THE MOMENTS BEFORE THE WORLD EXPLODES?

 [ GUNSHOT ] [ SCREAMING ] IT WAS HELTER-SKELTER. [ INTERMITTENT GUNSHOTS ] ONE SECOND, I WAS WALKING TO CLASS, AND THE NEXT, I WAS RUNNING FOR MY LIFE. [ GUNSHOTS ] I THOUGHT, "WHAT IS HAPPENING? THIS CAN'T BE REAL." GUNFIRE WAS RAINING DOWN ON US... [ CASING CLINKS ] [ BULLET RICOCHETS ] AAH! [ GASPS ] ...FROM THE TOP OF THE UNIVERSITY TOWER.

 [ GUNSHOTS CONTINUE ] Spelce: AUSTIN IN 1966 -- SLEEPY LITTLE COLLEGE TOWN. THE BIGGEST EVENTS WERE THE FOOTBALL GAMES. AND THEN, IT EXPLODED. [ GUNSHOTS, PEOPLE SCREAMING ] [ SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE ] Milam: 30 MINUTES IN, OVER A DOZEN PEOPLE HAD BEEN SHOT AND WERE LYING, BLEEDING TO DEATH AND ROASTING IN THAT SUN. AND THE GUNFIRE CONTINUED. Shoquist: SIRENS SCREAMING, PEOPLE SHOUTING, GUNSHOTS GOING OFF. [ GUNSHOTS ] [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] IT WAS ONE GOD-AWFUL MESS DOWN THERE, WITH BODIES ALL OVER THE PLACE. POLICE COMMUNICATIONS WERE ALMOST NONEXISTENT. Shoquist: WE HAD RADIOS IN THE CAR, SO IF YOU GOT OUT OF YOUR CAR, YOU WERE VIRTUALLY CUT OFF FROM COMMUNICATIONS. [ GUNSHOT ] THEY DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WAS ONE SNIPER OR 10. HEY, DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL SHOTGUNS? NO. WE HAD NO HIGH-POWERED WEAPONS AT ALL. WE HAD A 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN AND WE HAD OUR SIDEARMS -- A .38 PISTOL -- NEITHER OF WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE. I HAD A FRONT-ROW SEAT IN HELL. BLOOD AND BODIES ALL AROUND. THERE WERE POLICEMEN EVERYWHERE. BUT BULLETS KEPT COMING, AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. [ BULLET RICOCHETS ] AAH! THIS IS NEAL SPELCE ON THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS CAMPUS. IT'S LIKE A BATTLE SCENE. IT'S LIKE -- THERE'S ANOTHER SHOT AND ANOTHER SHOT. THE SIGHT IS REMINISCENT OF SOME SORT OF WAR. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF SHOTS. APPARENTLY, POLICE ARE RETURNING THE FIRE NOW. I'M SEEING A SCENE THAT YOU WOULD NEVER BE PREPARED FOR. WE'VE GOT TDBC REPORTERS RINGING THE CAMPUS. THE STORY WENT OUT TO ALL BROADCAST OUTLETS NATIONWIDE AND THEN, ULTIMATELY, WORLDWIDE. Lavergne: IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST CRIMES TO BE BROADCAST LIVE. BOB! BOB, YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH, YEAH. THERE'S A GUY OVER THERE. SITTING ACROSS THE STREET FROM US WAS A STUDENT PROPPED UP AGAINST A PARKING METER. AND HE'S A SITTING DUCK. ON THREE.ON THREE. TWO, ONE... TWO, ONE... GO! GO! Higley: THE BULLETS WERE COMING IN AT OUR FEET. YOU TALK ABOUT FEAR -- THAT IS BEYOND FRIGHTENING. [ GUNFIRE ] I REACHED OUT AND PULLED HIM IN. IS HE STILL ALIVE? AND, UH... MM. AND, AT THAT MOMENT, RECOGNIZED THAT HE WAS MORTALLY WOUNDED. [ GUNFIRE ] AMBULANCES ARE SCREAMING UP AND DOWN THE UNIVERSITY DRAG. Spelce: BRACKENRIDGE HOSPITAL WAS CHAOS. IT WAS THE ONLY FACILITY WHERE AN EMERGENCY ROOM WAS SET UP. Woman: HERE'S THE LIST, MR. ABBOTT. THANK YOU, MISS. THIS IS REPORTER JOE RAUDY? NORMALLY, THE MEDIA DOES NOT WANT TO RELEASE THE NAMES OF THE DEAD OR THE WOUNDED BEFORE THE FAMILIES ARE CONTACTED. KAREN GRIFFITH, UH, IRMA GARCIA, HARRY WALSH, BILLY SPEED. Milam: BUT IN THIS CASE, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE IN AUSTIN HAD FAMILY AT THE UNIVERSITY... Spelce: JOE RAUDY AT BRACKENRIDGE HOSPITAL STARTED TICKING OFF THE NAMES. ROBERT HEARD, ALEX HERNANDEZ, ROBERT BOYER, PAUL SONNTAG. THIS IS PAUL OVER AT THE NEWSROOM. IN OUR NEWSROOM, THE VETERAN NEWS DIRECTOR PAUL BOLTAN JUMPED IN. AND HIS VOICE WAS TREMBLING. HE SAID, "JOE..." [ BREATHING SHAKILY ] "READ THAT LIST OF NAMES AGAIN. I THINK YOU HAVE MY GRANDSON UP THERE." I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT BOY AT THE TIME. TURNS OUT HE WAS PAUL BOLTAN'S GRANDSON. THERE'S NO REPORT AS TO WHO THIS MAN MAY BE OR WHAT PROMPTED THIS APPARENT MADNESS. Milam: OF COURSE, THE OFFICERS WANT TO KNOW WHO'S DOING THIS, BUT AT THIS POINT, WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS STOPPING THE GUNFIRE. Shoquist: AT THE SECURITY OFFICE, A GUY WITH THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT THAT KNEW HOW TO GET TO THE BASE OF THE TOWER THROUGH A TUNNEL SYSTEM. ALL RIGHT, COME WITH US. Milam: A YOUNG POLICE OFFICER, HOUSTON McCOY, LEADS A GROUP OF OFFICERS THROUGH THE UNDERGROUND MAINTENANCE TUNNELS. Lavergne: AT THE SAME TIME, RAMIRO MARTINEZ RUNS IN A ZIGZAG MOTION... [ GUNSHOT, CASING CLINKS ] ...AND MAKES IT TO THE BUILDING UNHARMED. OFFICER! HOLD THE DOORS. MARTINEZ MEETS UP WITH ALLEN CRUM... LET'S GO. LET'S GO. Milam: ...WITH OFFICER JERRY DAY. THEY TAKE THE ELEVATOR TO THE 27th FLOOR. THE ACTUAL OBSERVATION DECK IS ONE FLOOR UP. YOU HAVE TO REACH THAT BY A STAIRWELL. Milam: SO WHAT YOU HAVE AT THIS POINT WAS TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS OF POLICE OFFICERS ACTING ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE, AND THEY JUST WERE NOT AWARE OF THE OTHER. Shoquist: WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS. [ ELEVATOR WHIRRING ] Shoquist: JERRY DAY HEARD THE ELEVATOR COMING UP, SO HE GOES BACK DOWN. Lavergne: ON THOSE STAIRS, THEY DISCOVER A FAMILY THAT HAD JUST BEEN MASSACRED. TWO OF THE PEOPLE ARE OBVIOUSLY DEAD, AND THE OTHERS ARE WOUNDED AND BLEEDING. [ Voice breaking ] I'M SO SCARED. Shoquist: THE GROUP OF US, INCLUDING MYSELF AND HOUSTON McCOY, GOING UP THAT ELEVATOR WHERE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE GONNA FIND WHEN THAT DOOR OPENS UP THERE. JERRY DAY IS STANDING ON THE 27th FLOOR. [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGING ] FOR ALL HE KNOWS, IT COULD BE OTHER PERPETRATORS FROM ANOTHER FLOOR COMING UP TO JOIN THE SNIPERS. WE ALL HAVE OUR WEAPONS DRAWN. [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ] AND HOUSTON'S GOT THE SHOTGUN AIMED POINT-BLANK. [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ] [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGING ] Shoquist: WE ALL HAVE OUR WEAPONS DRAWN. [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGING ] [ GASPING ] AND THEN, EVERYBODY KIND OF HAS A SMILE. IT'S PROBABLY THE ONLY TIME WE SMILED THE WHOLE DAY. IS ANYONE UP THERE? I GOT TWO ALREADY ON THEIR WAY UP. ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING WITH THEM. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS. WE NEED TO FIND EVERYBODY ON THE FLOOR, ALL RIGHT? I'LL GO WITH YOU GUYS. [ GUNFIRE, PEOPLE SCREAMING ] Female student: SO MUCH PAIN. SO MUCH DEATH. FOR 90 MINUTES, I STAYED PUT, HELPLESS AS THE BULLETS RAINED DOWN, TEARING FLESH, SHATTERING LIVES. WAS ANYONE GONNA STOP THIS? [ GUNSHOT ] Shoquist: RAY MARTINEZ AND CRUM WENT UP THE TOP OF THE STAIRS. [ DOOR FORCES OPEN ] SO THEY MAKE THEIR WAY OUT INTO THE RECEPTION AREA. Milam: THEY FIND THE BODY OF A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN WHOSE HEAD HAD BEEN CAVED IN, LYING BEHIND A COUCH. ARE WE DOING THIS? DAMN RIGHT WE ARE. WELL, THEN, YOU'D BETTER DEPUTIZE ME. YOU'RE NOT A COP? I WAS A SERGEANT IN THE AIR FORCE. SO, RAMIRO SAYS, "OKAY. CONSIDER YOURSELF DEPUTIZED." THEY KNOW THAT THIS HAS GOT TO COME TO AN END AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE THE ONES TO DO IT. [ RAPID GUNFIRE ] [ GUNSHOT ] [ GUNSHOT ] [ THUD ] [ GUNSHOT ] AND THEN, AFTER WHAT SEEMED LIKE A LIFETIME OF GUNFIRE AND SCREAMS AND TERROR, I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I HEARD NEXT -- NOTHING. PURE SILENCE. GO RADIO THE ALL-CLEAR. Spelce: THE FIRING HAS NOW STOPPED. IT NOW SEEMS TO BE OVER AS FAR AS THE SHOOTING IS CONCERNED. Milam: THE SNIPER IS DEAD. AND HE IS A YOUNG MAN WEARING A WHITE HEADBAND, AND HE'S DRESSED IN WORKMAN OVERALLS. THERE WERE MULTIPLE RIFLES LAID OUT. Shoquist: HE HAD CANNED FOOD. HE HAD TOILET PAPER. HE WAS PREPARED TO BE UP THERE A NUMBER OF DAYS. BUT HE CLEARLY DIDN'T INTEND TO COME DOWN ALIVE. OFFICER McCOY FINDS A UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS I.D. CARD IDENTIFYING THIS MAN AS AN ARCHITECTURAL-ENGINEERING STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY WHO IS 25 YEARS OLD. CHARLES J. WHITMAN. CHARLES JOSEPH WHITMAN. Spelce: THE SNIPER, APPARENTLY TENTATIVELY IDENTIFIED AS CHARLES J. WHITMAN, 25 YEARS OLD, IS DEAD. [ INDISTINCT TALKING ] Spelce: A SEA OF PEOPLE CONVERGED ON THE SOUTH MALL. AND THEY LOOKED UP AT THE TOWER, AND THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER. BUT IT WAS JUST, "WHAT HAS HAPPENED?" Milam: THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE WOULD BE SHOOTING PEOPLE THEY DID NOT KNOW FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO DO SO WAS JUST NOT IN THEIR MENTAL LANDSCAPE IN 1966. [ TYPEWRITER CLACKING ] THIS IS ALL WE HAVE ON WHITMAN. THANKS. Spelce: ALL THE AUTHORITIES NEEDED TO TRY TO DETERMINE -- "COULD WE HAVE PREVENTED THIS? IS THERE A WAY WE COULD HAVE STOPPED THIS?" Lavergne: AT THAT TIME, THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CHARLES WHITMAN, INCLUDING HIS ADDRESS. THE GUY HAD NO CRIMINAL BACKGROUND. JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. CHARLES WHITMAN'S FRIENDS WERE JUST UTTERLY SHOCKED. TO THEM, HE WAS A NICE GUY. Milam: THEY ALL SAID THAT HE WAS SMART, THAT HE HAD A BRIGHT FUTURE. THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG. Lavergne: CHARLES WHITMAN WAS FROM A SEASIDE TOWN CALLED LAKEWORTH, FLORIDA. HE WAS THE SON OF A VERY SUCCESSFUL PLUMBING CONTRACTOR. Milam: HIS MOTHER WAS A DEVOUT CATHOLIC WHO STAYED AT HOME TO RAISE HER THREE BOYS. CHARLES WAS AN ACCOMPLISHED PIANO PLAYER BY THE AGE OF 12. Lavergne: HE WAS, REPORTEDLY, THE YOUNGEST EAGLE SCOUT IN HISTORY, AND HE HAD AN I.Q. AS HIGH AS 139. THE MARINE CORPS. I SEE. AND WHAT YEARS WERE THAT? Milam: CHARLES WHITMAN JOINED THE MARINE CORPS. AND, AS HE HAD THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE, HE EXCELLED. Spelce: HE EARNED A VERY HIGH SHARPSHOOTER RATING. HE WAS A DECORATED SOLDIER. HE EVEN SAVED A FELLOW SOLDIER'S LIFE. Lavergne: THE MARINES HAD A SCHOLARSHIP. Milam: SO, CHARLES WHITMAN WAS OFFERED THE SCHOLARSHIP IN ENGINEERING TO GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AND BECOME A COMMISSIONED OFFICER. Man: HAVE YOU GUYS TALKED WITH KATHY? WHO'S KATHY? IT'S HIS WIFE. Milam: THE POLICE QUICKLY FOUND OUT THAT THEY LIVED IN A LITTLE HOUSE IN SOUTH AUSTIN. NO ONE ANSWERS THE DOOR. Man: MRS. WHITMAN? THIS IS THE POLICE. ARE YOU HOME? IN FEBRUARY OF 1962, CHARLES WHITMAN MET KATHLEEN LEISSNER. Whitman: SO, WHAT ARE -- WHAT ARE YOU READING? UM, JUST "ANTIGONE." [ CHUCKLES ] I DON'T KNOW. OH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE. YOU KNOW IT? YEAH. DO YOU LIKE IT? I DO. YEAH? I DO. YEAH. IT'S, UH, IT'S -- IT'S HEAVY. [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S TRUE. I'VE BEEN NOTICING THAT. YEAH. AND HE WAS IMMEDIATELY MESMERIZED BY HER. ARE YOU FROM AROUND HERE? UM, NO. I JUST MOVED HERE, ACTUALLY. REALLY? WHERE YOU FROM? I'M FROM FLORIDA. OH, WOW. SO THIS MUST BE REALLY DIFFERENT FOR YOU. EH, YOU KNOW. THE HUMIDITY'S THE SAME. OH, YEAH. [ CHUCKLES ] WELL, I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING AROUND HERE? I CAN SHOW YOU AROUND, IF YOU WANT. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. HAVE YOU EATEN LUNCH? NO. I HAVEN'T. SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL, SMALL-TOWN TEXAS GIRL WHO EVERYBODY LOVED. SIX MONTHS LATER, THEY MARRY. Lavergne: IN AUGUST OF 1962, CHARLES WHITMAN SEEMS TO HAVE EVERYTHING GOING FOR HIM. HE'S VERY HANDSOME. Milam: HE'S GOT A BEAUTIFUL, ACCOMPLISHED WIFE, A FULL-RIDE SCHOLARSHIP. Lavergne: AND HE HAS VERY GOOD FRIENDS. HOW COULD A MAN LIKE THIS DO WHAT HE DID? THIS IS NOT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF A MONSTER. THEY ENTER THE BEDROOM... ...AND THEY REALIZE THAT THE BLOODBATH IS NOT YET OVER. Female student: WITH SO MANY BODIES FALLEN ALL OVER CAMPUS, IT HADN'T OCCURRED TO POLICE THAT THE CRIME SCENE COULD STRETCH WIDER. BUT AS IT TURNS OUT, IT COULD. IN THE BED IS HIS WIFE, KATHY. Lavergne: SHE HAD BEEN BRUTALLY STABBED FIVE TIMES IN THE CHEST. IT WAS A VERY LARGE KNIFE -- EITHER A BAYONET OR A HUNTING KNIFE. Shoquist: IT APPEARED THAT SHE HAD BEEN ASLEEP WHEN SHE WAS STABBED AND THEN COVERED UP WITH A SHEET. THE POLICE FOUND A LONG NOTE LEFT BY CHARLES WHITMAN. Lavergne: IT WAS A VERY CHILLING NOTE. [ TYPEWRITER CLACKS ] Whitman: "LATELY -- I CAN'T RECALL WHEN IT STARTED -- "I HAVE BEEN A VICTIM "OF MANY UNUSUAL AND IRRATIONAL THOUGHTS. "IT WAS AFTER MUCH THOUGHT "THAT I DECIDED TO KILL MY WIFE, KATHY, TONIGHT "AFTER I PICK HER UP FROM WORK AT THE TELEPHONE COMPANY. "I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS SELFISHNESS "OR I DON'T WANT HER TO HAVE TO FACE THE EMBARRASSMENT "MY ACTIONS WOULD SURELY CAUSE HER." GET A LOAD OF THIS. Lavergne: THE NOTE WENT ON TO SAY, "FOR SIMILAR REASONS I HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE MY MOTHER'S LIFE." Milam: HIS MOTHER IS SEPARATED FROM HIS FATHER AND LIVING IN AUSTIN. Lavergne: CHARLES WHITMAN'S MOTHER, MARGARET, HAD BEEN BEATEN AND STABBED TO DEATH AND PLACED IN HER BED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE SHE WAS ASLEEP. Milam: THE POLICE OFFICERS FIND A SECOND NOTE. AND THIS IS WHERE THEY FIRST SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON WITHIN HIS MIND. "THE INTENSE HATRED I FEEL FOR MY FATHER "IS BEYOND DESCRIPTION. "MY MOTHER GAVE THAT MAN THE BEST 25 YEARS OF HER LIFE. "I AM TRULY SORRY THAT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I COULD SEE "TO RELIEVE HER SUFFERING, BUT I THINK IT WAS BEST." CHARLES WHITMAN'S LIFE, IT WAS NOT AS GOLDEN AS THEY ORIGINALLY PERCEIVED IT TO BE. Spelce: HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER HAD A STORMY RELATIONSHIP. IN FACT, HIS FATHER ABUSED HIS MOTHER. Lavergne: CHARLES WHITMAN SR. WAS A VERY STERN, AND SOME PEOPLE EVEN SAY A VERY CRUEL, FATHER. WHEN CHARLES WAS 17 YEARS OLD, HE GOT A LITTLE DRUNK, AND HIS FATHER BEAT HIM UP AND THREW HIM IN A SWIMMING POOL, AND CHARLES ALMOST DROWNED. Schug: THAT WAS THE EVENT THAT PROVOKED HIM INTO JOINING THE MARINE CORPS. TO GET AWAY FROM HIS FATHER. DID YOU, UH, SPEAK WITH THE PROFESSOR IN 204? IN THE SPRING OF 1963, THREE YEARS BEFORE THE SHOOTING, HE'S NOT REALLY FOCUSING ON SCHOOL, AND HIS GRADES BEGIN TO SLIP. CHARLES WHITMAN LOST HIS SCHOLARSHIP. AND THE MARINE CORPS IS NOT GONNA COUNT HIS TIME AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS. SO HE'S FORCED TO RETURN TO ACTIVE DUTY. AND AT THIS POINT, CHARLES WHITMAN'S LIFE BEGINS TO FALL APART. Female student: WITH EVERY DAY THAT PASSED, WE LEARNED MORE ABOUT CHARLES WHITMAN. A FEW YEARS BEFORE THE SHOOTING, HE LOST THAT HARD-WON MARINE CORPS SCHOLARSHIP, WHICH MEANT HE HAD TO RETURN TO ACTIVE DUTY. AND THAT'S WHEN A DARKNESS INSIDE HIM BEGAN TO GROW. TWO. COME ON. YOU GOT TO BE QUICK ON YOUR FEET. YOU PUT 'EM IN THE PILE? COME ON, MAN. HE STARTED GAMBLING -- HEAVILY. THANK YOU. THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT. MARINES, WHO WANTS TO DEAL ME IN? READ 'EM. WHERE'S THE $45 YOU OWE ME? [ CHUCKLES ] I OWE YOU $30. I WANT $15 IN INTEREST, AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY ME, OR I'M GONNA KNOCK YOUR TEETH IN. HOW ABOUT YOU GET NOTHING? KNOCK IT OFF! COME ON, MAN! Schug: AND ACTUALLY, THIS CULMINATES IN THE FIRST DOCUMENTED ACT OF VIOLENCE COMMITTED BY CHARLIE WHEN HE ASSAULTS A FELLOW MARINE OVER A GAMBLING DEBT. HIS SECOND STINT AS AN ENLISTED MAN IS THE OPPOSITE OF HIS FIRST. Lavergne: HE WAS A TROUBLEMAKER, AND HE DID HARD LABOR IN NOVEMBER OF 1963. Milam: AND IS REDUCED BACK IN RANK TO A BUCK PRIVATE. Whitman: "I WISH SO MUCH THAT THE MARINE CORPS "WOULD QUIT HINDERING MY LIFE AND GIVE ME A DISCHARGE. I WONDER IF I WILL EVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD." HE'S KEEPING A JOURNAL, AND HE'S SEETHING WITH ANGER. "I HAVE GREAT PLANS AND DREAMS. "I HAVE SO MUCH I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. "SEEMS I'LL NEVER GET STARTED. GOD, I CAN'T STAND THE CORPS." Lavergne: HE GETS A DISCHARGE FROM THE MARINES, AND CHARLES WHITMAN RETURNED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS IN THE SPRING OF 1965, ONE YEAR BEFORE THE SHOOTING. HEY. HOW WAS WORK? IT WAS FINE. JUST THE SAME AS ALWAYS. DID YOU... MAKE ANYTHING FOR DINNER? NO, I -- I'VE BEEN... DOING HOMEWORK. WELL... I GOT PAID TODAY. WE CAN GO OUT AND GRAB A BITE. BUT AT THIS POINT, HE NO LONGER HAS THE SCHOLARSHIP. I'M NOT HUNGRY. Lavergne: THIS IS A YOUNG MAN WHO IS BEING SUPPORTED BY HIS WIFE AND HIS FATHER, AND HE DOESN'T LIKE THAT. WHAT'S WRONG? NOTHING. I JUST HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. SO I'LL LEAVE YOU BE. IT'S AROUND THIS TIME THAT CHARLES WHITMAN BECOMES AWARE THAT SOMETHING IS CHANGING INSIDE HIM. Spelce: CHARLES WHITMAN WROTE DOWN THAT HE HAD SOME SEVERE HEADACHES THAT HE HAD NOT NOTICED PREVIOUSLY. [ CHUCKLES ] Elaine: DON'T CHAR THEM, LARRY. COME ON, LARRY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GIVE ME THE SPATULA. HERE, YOU WANT TO BE GRILLMASTER? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE GRILL? IT'S NICE. YEAH. Schug: HE'S BECOMING QUIETER. HE CAN'T FOCUS. "THERE IS SOMETHING UNUSUAL IN MY MENTAL STATE. SEEMS AS IF I AM GOING TO EXPLODE." * ...BUT MY BABY CAN'T BE FOUND * [ RADIO TUNING ] * ...STARS ARE RISING * * BRIGHT MORNING STARS ARE RISING * Milam: HE IS NOW PROJECTING AN IMAGE, AND CHARLES WHITMAN'S LIFE BECOMES MORE AND MORE OF A FACADE. DO YOU KNOW IF HE HAD ANY DRUG OR ALCOHOL PROBLEMS? CHARLIE, UH, WAS TAKING THIS AMPHETAMINE. Lavergne: ONE OF THE THINGS HE TRIED TO DO IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH MORE WAS TO SLEEP LESS, AND HE DID THAT BY TAKING A DEXTROAMPHETAMINE CALLED DEXEDRINE. I KNOW IT DIDN'T HELP HIS TEMPER. Man: DID HE HAVE A BAD TEMPER? I MEAN, I-I DON'T -- I NEVER SAW IT PERSONALLY. I KNOW HE WASN'T... PROUD ABOUT IT. Schug: INVESTIGATORS ALSO LEARNED THAT HE HAD ADMITTED TO STRIKING HIS WIFE, KATHY, ON TWO OCCASIONS AND THAT HE FELT HORRIBLE ABOUT THIS. BECAUSE HE ASSOCIATED THAT WITH HIS FATHER. HE WITNESSED HIS FATHER BEAT HIS MOTHER, AND FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE SHOOTING, CHARLIE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM HER, AND SHE CLEARLY BELIEVED THAT HER SAFETY WAS IMPERILED. Milam: HIS MOTHER FINALLY HAS THE COURAGE TO LEAVE HIS FATHER, AND SO HE MOVES HER ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO AUSTIN, TEXAS, WHERE HE SETS HER UP IN AN APARTMENT. Female student: AND IT SEEMED LIKE THAT GESTURE OF KINDNESS FROM A SON TO HIS MOTHER BROUGHT BACK AN OLD FAMILIAR STRAIN. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] CHARLES WHITMAN SR. WAS CONSTANTLY PHONING HIS SON. Whitman: DAD... WHITMAN SR: Your mother needs to get her stuff packed up... I NEED YOU TO LET ME TALK. ...airplane... DAD! Charles! Milam: "YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME. "YOU'VE GOT TO TALK TO YOUR MOTHER. HELP ME GET THIS FAMILY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN." I UNDERSTAND -- We have certain obligations. You and me are gonna figure this thing out right now. WILL YOU PLEASE JUST LET ME TALK FOR A S-- Understand something -- She needs to come home right now. STOP TALKING FOR A SECOND AND LET ME TALK! I want you to listen to me now... [ Talking continues indistinctly ] Lavergne: HE EXPERIENCES EMOTIONAL DISTRESS TO THE POINT OF A BREAK. KATHY HERSELF SUGGESTED THAT HE SEE A PSYCHIATRIST. Schug: ON MARCH 29, 1966, JUST THREE WEEKS AFTER HIS PARENTS' SEPARATION, CHARLES IS REFERRED TO SEE STAFF PSYCHIATRIST DR. MAURICE DEAN HEATLY. SO... WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE TODAY? ALL RIGHT. I GET VERY UPSET, AND I CAN'T CONTROL MY -- MY TEMPER. DR. HEATLY! DR. HEATLY! DR. HEATLY. DR. HEATLY! Schug: DETAILS OF THAT MEETING WERE MADE PUBLIC BY THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS A FEW DAYS AFTER THE SHOOTING. HE WAS THIS MASSIVE, MUSCULAR YOUTH WHO SEEMED TO BE OOZING WITH HOSTILITY. Spelce: DR. MAURICE HEATLY HELD A NEWS CONFERENCE, TRYING TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED. I'VE BEEN HAVING THESE HEADACHES QUITE FREQUENTLY. MY FATHER WAS OUTRAGED. THREW ME IN THE POOL. [ CHUCKLES ] VERY ANGRY. ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MIGHT BE WILLING TO TELL ME? WELL, I'VE HAD SOME THOUGHTS, UH... I'VE HAD A THOUGHT THAT I WOULD GO UP TO THE TOWER AT THE UNIVERSITY AND I WOULD TAKE MY DEER RIFLE... ...AND I WOULD SHOOT PEOPLE. DR. HEATLY! DR. HEATLY! IF HE WAS CONTEMPLATING SHOOTING PEOPLE, WHY DIDN'T YOU REPORT HIM? Spelce: THE PRESS WAS STUPEFIED. "WHAT? YOU KNEW THIS? WHY DIDN'T YOU DO SOMETHING?" DR. HEATLY! DR. HEATLY! DR. HEATLY! DR. HEATLY! Schug: HOWEVER, GIVEN THE GUIDELINES OF 1966, DR. HEATLY HAD TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY. Lavergne: SO DR. HEATLY DID THE ONLY THING THAT WAS REALISTICALLY AVAILABLE TO HIM, AND THAT'S ASK WHITMAN TO COME BACK, AND WHITMAN CHOSE NOT TO RETURN. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, BUT AFTERWARD I BECAME CONVINCED THAT I COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING, THAT IF I'D SEEN HIM AROUND CAMPUS, I COULD HAVE WARNED SOMEONE THAT THAT QUIET-LOOKING MAN SITTING ALONE WAS LIKE A STICK OF DYNAMITE, JUST WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO LIGHT ITS FUSE. Spelce: ACCORDING TO A FAMILY MEMBER, JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THE SHOOTING ITSELF, HIS FATHER HAD THREATENED TO CUT OFF MONEY BEING SENT TO THE FAMILY. Schug: THIS PUTS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON CHARLES. HE'S LEFT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR HIS MOTHER AND HIS WIFE. Lavergne: THE TIMING SUPPORTS THE IDEA THAT THIS WAS KIND OF A STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK. [ TYPEWRITER CLACKING ] WAS THAT THE PUSH THAT CHARLES WHITMAN NEEDED? NO ONE CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN. BUT THAT'S WHEN HIS VIOLENT FANTASIES BECAME OUR REALITY. THE NIGHT BEFORE THE SHOOTING, HE DROPPED OFF KATHY AT THE PHONE COMPANY, AND HE RETURNS HOME TO JEWELL STREET AND BEGINS TYPING HIS INFAMOUS NOTE. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Elaine: HI, CHARLIE. HEY, GUYS. HI. JUST COME ON IN. HOW'S IT GOING? HOW'S IT GOING? GOOD TO SEE YOU. WHAT YOU WORKING ON, CHARLIE? NEXT GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL? [ CHUCKLES ] Larry: WHAT YOU WORKING ON, CHARLIE? NEXT GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL? [ LARRY AND ELAINE CHUCKLE ] Milam: LARRY AND ELAINE FEASE SEE A LETTER, AND THEY'RE SO CLOSE TO UNCOVERING WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO. [ CHUCKLES ] NO. I'M WRITING A FRIEND IN WASHINGTON. I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN FIVE YEARS. UH, SIT DOWN. YEAH. THANK YOU. YOU GUYS, UH, WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK? INTERESTINGLY, THEY REPORT TO THE POLICE THAT CHARLES APPEARED MORE CALM AND RELAXED AND HAPPY THAN HE HAD APPEARED IN MONTHS. Female student: IT HAD BEEN BUILDING FOR A LONG TIME IN SMALL WAYS, NOTICEABLE NOT EVEN TO THOSE CLOSEST TO HIM. AND THEN... THE DAM BURST. THE FIRST TO GO WERE THE PEOPLE HE LOVED -- HIS MOTHER, HIS WIFE. AND THEN HE TURNED HIS RAGE OUTWARD -- ON US. Milam: THE MORNING OF THE SHOOTINGS, CHARLES WHITMAN WENT TO SEVERAL GUN STORES, BUYING ADDITIONAL WEAPONS, BUYING HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION. AND THEN HE DRESSED IN A WORKMAN'S OVERALLS AND BLUFFED HIS WAY ONTO THE CAMPUS BY SAYING HE WAS THERE TO DO SOME REPAIRS. THE ELEVATOR DIDN'T WORK. Woman: IS IT STUCK? Lavergne: AND, IN A TRAGIC IRONY, ONE OF THE ELEVATOR OPERATORS ACTUALLY HELPED HIM. AND SHE WAS ABLE TO TURN THE POWER ON HIM. AND HE SAID, SO INFAMOUSLY... THANK YOU. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HAPPY THAT MAKES ME. Shoquist: EDNA TOWNSLEY WAS A RECEPTIONIST UP THERE. SHE WASN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE THERE THAT DAY. SHE WAS TAKING SOMEBODY'S PLACE. MAY I HELP YOU? SIR? THIS IS THE WOMAN THAT ALLEN CRUM AND RAMIRO STUMBLE ACROSS WHEN THEY FIRST ENTER THE RECEPTION AREA. CHARLES WHITMAN TAKES EDNA TOWNSLEY'S DESK, AND HE BEGINS TO BARRICADE THE DOOR. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] BUT AT THAT MOMENT, TWO SISTERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE COMING UP THE STAIRS TO LOOK OUT AT THE OBSERVATION DECK. [ CONVERSATION CONTINUES ] [ SHOTGUN COCKS ] [ GUNSHOT ] 16-YEAR-OLD MARK GABOUR IS KILLED INSTANTLY. HIS OLDER BROTHER, MICHAEL, IS ALSO HIT. Spelce: HE HIT THEIR MOTHER, MARY GABOUR. Milam: AND MIKE AND MARK'S AUNT, MARGUERITE LAMPORT, KILLING HER. WE'D LEARNED EVERYTHING WE COULD LEARN ABOUT CHARLES WHITMAN. BUT A PERSON'S BIOGRAPHY, NO MATTER HOW DETAILED, ISN'T THE PERSON. [ GUNSHOT ] WHY DID WHITMAN DO THIS? FROM HIS LETTERS, IT SEEMS LIKE EVEN HE DIDN'T KNOW. Schug: HE REQUESTED THAT SOMEONE AUTOPSY HIS BRAIN. DURING THE AUTOPSY IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT CHARLES HAD A LARGE TUMOR -- THE SIZE OF A WALNUT -- IN AN AREA OF THE BRAIN ASSOCIATED WITH EMOTION AND AGGRESSION, PERHAPS LEADING TO MORE VIOLENCE AND AGGRESSIVE IMPULSES IN CHARLES. HOWEVER, WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SIMILAR TUMORS IN THEIR BRAIN AND YET DO NOT GO UP ON TOP OF CLOCK TOWERS AND START SHOOTING INDISCRIMINATELY AT PEOPLE. MAYBE I'M SIMPLISTIC, BUT I STILL THINK THERE'S GOOD AND THERE'S EVIL, AND THIS WAS JUST PURE EVIL. Lavergne: UNDERSTANDING CHARLES WHITMAN IS UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH A YOUNG MAN WHO WANTS TO SET UP HIS DAD FOR SOMETHING REALLY TERRIBLE. HE DOES THE ONE THING HE DOES WELL -- SHOOTS. HE SHOOTS PEOPLE AND HE KILLS THE TWO PEOPLE HE SAYS HE LOVES SO THAT HIS FATHER IS LEFT BEHIND TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN ALL OF WHAT HE HAS DONE. [ PEOPLE SCREAMING ] [ GUNFIRE ] [ DOOR FORCES OPEN ] [ GUNSHOT ] ARE WE DOING THIS? DAMN RIGHT WE ARE. [ SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE ] Milam: RAMIRO GOES FIRST TO THE OBSERVATION DECK, AND THERE'S NO ONE THERE. ALLEN CRUM AND JERRY DAY GO ONE WAY, AND HOUSTON McCOY AND RAMIRO GO THE OTHER. EVERYTHING STARTED HAPPENING SO QUICKLY. Milam: THE ADRENALINE'S PUMPING. Shoquist: ALL OF THIS HAPPENS IN A MATTER OF A COUPLE OF SECONDS. THE SNIPER WASN'T POINTED TOWARDS HIM. [ GUN COCKS ] [ GUNSHOTS ] RAY JUST BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM -- SIX SHOTS AS FAST AS HE CAN PULL THE TRIGGER. BUT HE'S NEVER HIT BY THE REVOLVER. McCOY, BEHIND HIM, FIRES HIS SHOTGUN TWO TIMES, HITTING THE YOUNG MAN IN THE HEAD. AND THEN MARTINEZ GRABS THAT SHOTGUN AND FIRES A THIRD SHOT INTO HIS SHOULDER. WHAT'S THAT SAYING? "LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT"? AS TERRIBLE AS THIS WAS, WE DID LEARN A FEW THINGS FROM IT. Spelce: A LOT OF PEOPLE CREDIT THAT WITH THE SUBSEQUENT CREATION OF S.W.A.T. TEAMS. AMBULANCES, THEY DEVELOPED E.M.T.s. Lavergne: AND TODAY, IN MANY STATES, IT IS LAW THAT PUBLIC EMPLOYEES HAVE TO REPORT THREATS TOWARDS INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS. BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST CHANGE THAT OCCURRED WAS THAT THIS HIDEOUS ACT WAS NOW IN OUR COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS. THE SEAL HAD BEEN BROKEN. Spelce: IT'S LIKE A BATTLEFIELD. I REMEMBER MY DAD TELLING ME THAT, "THIS IS NOT GOOD, "BECAUSE THAT GUY IS SHOWING US WHAT IS POSSIBLE. WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT MORE OF THIS." COLUMBINE. VIRGINIA TECH. NEWTOWN. I THINK CHARLES WHITMAN TOLD VERY, VERY TROUBLED PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO LIVE ANYMORE WHAT THEY CAN DO TO MAKE A NAME FOR THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY FORCE SOMEBODY ELSE TO KILL THEM. Female student: AND THERE ARE SOME WHO FOUND A WAY TO DENY WHITMAN -- AND ANY OF HIS IMITATORS -- THAT NOTORIETY. Shoquist: HOUSTON McCOY NEVER WOULD USE THE SNIPER'S NAME. AND I AGREE. AND BY NOT USING HIS NAME, WE'RE NOT ELEVATING HIM TO THAT LEVEL THAT HE WANTED TO BE ELEVATED TO. AND FOR ME, ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES, THE WORST PART IS THAT I WILL NEVER ENTIRELY FEEL SAFE AGAIN, NO MATTER WHERE I GO. Lavergne: BEFORE THIS INCIDENT, MANY OF US ASSUMED THAT THERE WAS SAFETY IN PUBLIC PLACES. CHARLES WHITMAN, IN SOME WAYS, TOOK THAT AWAY FROM US. Spelce: THE KEY IS TRYING TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM. BUT HOW DO YOU DO THAT IN A FREE SOCIETY? Milam: THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO DO WHAT CHARLES WHITMAN DID. IT'S JUST PART OF WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE IN AMERICA. * BRIGHT MORNING STARS ARE RISING * * BRIGHT MORNING STARS ARE RISING * * BRIGHT MORNING STARS ARE RISING * * DAY IS BREAKING IN MY SOUL * * DAY IS BREAKING IN MY SOUL *
