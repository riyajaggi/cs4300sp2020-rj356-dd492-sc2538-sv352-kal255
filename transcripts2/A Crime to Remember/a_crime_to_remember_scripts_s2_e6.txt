 AND THE MOST AWFUL THING OF ALL, A MAN TRAPPED INSIDE THE CAR, JUST BLAZE AND BURN WHERE LUCILLE'S HUSBAND, CORK, HAD BEEN WHEN SHE RAN FOR HELP. THERE WAS NO PERSON LEFT. [ SOBBING ] THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED ON A VERY DARK, SMALL LITTLE COUNTRY ROAD. ORANGE GROVES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD THAT WERE -- ON ONE SIDE, THE GROVES WERE SET DOWN. [ SOBBING CONTINUES ] THERE ARE NO STREET LIGHTS, AND MY MOTHER WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN WHERE THE NEAREST HOUSE WAS. AND, IN FACT, THE NEAREST HOUSE WAS A LONG WAYS AWAY.

 MAN: Operator. SAN BERNARDINO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. TELL THEM TO HURRY, PLEASE. LUCILLE ARRIVES ABOUT 1:45 A.M. ARE THEY COMING? ARE THEY COMING? YES, THEY'RE COMING. SHE'S SMUDGED. SHE'S DIRTY. THERE'S THE SMELL OF BURNT HAIR. HE'S ALL BURNT. WHAT -- WHAT DO I SAY THE KIDS? WHAT DO I TELL THEM? SHE'S CONFUSED ABOUT THE EVENTS, BUT SHE KNOWS THAT THE LAST TIME SHE SAW HER HUSBAND, HE WAS BLACK IN THE CAR, BURNING. Debra: SHE IS HYSTERICAL, AND SHE SAYS, "WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL MY CHILDREN? "THERE CAN'T BE A CASKET. THERE'S NO PERSON." [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] OKAY, MA'AM, I'M GONNA NEED TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ACCIDENT. Ronan: MY MOTHER'S BROUGHT BACK TO THE SCENE, AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS ARRIVED THERE AND THERE ARE SHERIFFS THERE, AND MY FATHER IS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE CAR. PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, WHERE WERE YOU COMING FROM? [ Voice breaking ] YEAH, WE, UM, WE JUST -- WE NEEDED MILK. SO MY MOTHER TELLS THE POLICE, "THE KIDS HAVE GONE TO SLEEP." McNamara: CORK HAD A MIGRAINE, SOMETHING WHICH HE SUFFERED FROM FOR MANY YEARS. DO WE HAVE ANY HOT CHOCOLATE? OH, YEAH, I'LL MAKE YOU SOME. THANK YOU. AND THAT'S WHEN SHE LEARNED THAT THEY WERE OUT OF MILK, NOT ONLY FOR THE HOT CHOCOLATE, BUT FOR THE KIDS' BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING. THEY REALLY NEEDED THAT. Debra: MY MOM CAME IN TO TELL ME THAT THEY WERE GOING DOWN THE HILL TO GET MILK, AND TO GO AND GET ANYTHING WAS LIKE A 5 OR 10-MILE TRIP TO DO THAT. Ronan: AND HE WANTED TO GO ALONG WITH HER. MY MOTHER DROVE BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS SICK. MY MOTHER RECALLS REACHING OVER AND LOCKING THE DOOR BECAUSE SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT MY FATHER LEARNING AGAINST IT, I THINK, MIGHT OPEN IT. SO SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT HE WAS -- HE WAS SECURE. McNamara: SO CORK AND LUCILLE LEAVE THE HOUSE. IT'S ABOUT 11:30 P.M. THE FIRST STORE THAT WE WENT TO WAS CLOSED, SO WE DECIDED TO COME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE. SO NOW THEY HAD TO GO TO THE NEXT PLACE THAT THEY KNEW WOULD BE OPEN, WHICH WAS ACROSS TOWN. THEY WENT TO A MAYFAIR MARKET THERE THAT WAS, I THINK, A 24-HOUR STORE. SAN BERNARDINO WAS GROWING IN THE '60s, BUT IT WAS STILL SMALL ENOUGH THAT PEOPLE KNEW EACH OTHER. SO WHEN THE WOMAN WITH THE MILK WALKED BY ME THAT NIGHT, SHE WAS A FAMILIAR FACE. I DIDN'T KNOW HER NAME WAS LUCILLE UNTIL LATER. LUCILLE POPS IN, GETS THE MILK. CORK HAS REMAINED IN THE VEHICLE. SHE COMES BACK OUT, GETS IN THE CAR, AND THEY'RE GONNA HEAD HOME AGAIN. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] WE WERE JUST DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD, AND THE CAR JUST PULLED TO THE RIGHT. LUCILLE TELLS POLICE THAT AS SHE'S DRIVING UP THE WINDY ROAD, SHE'S GOING ABOUT 35 MILES PER HOUR. Ronan: AND THE CAR JUST JERKED TO THE RIGHT AND JERKED OFF THE ROAD. SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. [ TIRES SCREECH ] AND THE NEXT THING SHE KNEW, THERE WERE FLAMES. SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW THEY STARTED. SHE'S NOT SURE HOW LONG THEY WERE THERE BEFORE SHE RECOGNIZED THEM. McNamara: SHE RUNS TO HIS SIDE OF THE CAR. AND I REALIZED THAT CORK WAS ASLEEP, AND HIS DOOR WAS LOCKED. AND SO I, UM, I WENT AND I FOUND A ROCK TO BREAK THE WINDOW. BUT IT'S SO HOT AT THIS POINT, SHE CAN'T REACH IN AND EVEN OPEN THE CAR DOOR FOR HIM. SHE LOOKS AROUND. SHE FINDS A STICK, AND SHE THINKS, "MAYBE I CAN PUT THAT THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW AND SOMEHOW PUSH MY HUSBAND OUT OF THE CAR." BUT HE'S GOT 60 POUNDS ON HER. SHE'S NOT ABLE TO HELP HIM AT ALL. AND WORSE YET, HE'S COVERED IN A BLANKET, WHICH IS STARTING TO INCINERATE. I JUST RAN TO GET HELP. THE POLICE GET CLOSER AND TAKE A LOOK, AND WHAT THEY SEE CORROBORATES LUCILLE'S STORY. THE MILK CARTONS ARE IN THE BACKSEAT. Ronan: THERE HAD BEEN A ROCK THROWN THROUGH THE WINDOW, AS SHE SAID IT WAS. McNamara: NEARBY, POLICE FIND A FOUR-FOOT-LONG BRANCH THAT WAS PARTIALLY BURNED THAT CORROBORATES THAT SHE TRIED TO USE THIS TO PUSH HER HUSBAND OUT OF THE VEHICLE. Ronan: THERE WERE SKID MARKS IN THE GRAVEL ALONG THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. AND THE CAR WHEELS WERE TURNED IN THE DIRECTION THAT SHE SAID, THAT THE CAR HAD TURNED OFF TO THE RIGHT. McNamara: AND THERE'S A NAIL EMBEDDED IN THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE. EVENTUALLY, IT WAS CHRISTENED THE INLAND EMPIRE, BUT BACK IN 1964, THE MILES OF DESERT SCRUB ROLLING DOWN FROM THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS WAS JUST STARTING TO BECOME ANOTHER SUBURB IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUNSHINE DREAM, A PLACE THAT WAS ALL ABOUT THE NEW, THE POSSIBLE, THE FUTURE. BUT IT WASN'T ABOUT THOSE THINGS ON THIS MORNING. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW AWFUL THAT NIGHT MUST'VE BEEN, SEEING A MAN, YOUR HUSBAND, DIE LIKE THAT. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ] Man: LOOK AT THAT. BUT IN THE MORNING, THINGS TOOK AN EVEN DARKER TURN BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE POLICE DISCOVERED A HOLE IN LUCILLE'S STORY, ONE THAT MIGHT MEAN THIS WAS ALL MUCH UGLIER THAN JUST A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT. Debra: THE SUSPICION REALLY SETS IN WHEN THEY SEE THE GAS CAN. Woman: THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WAS STILL SIFTING THROUGH THE SMOLDERING MESS AND PICKING THROUGH THE SHELL OF THE BURNT-OUT CAR WHEN THEY LET LUCILLE MILLER LEAVE THE SITE OF THE ACCIDENT. McNamara: SHE'S TAKEN BACK HOME AROUND 6 A.M. I WAKE UP THAT MORNING OF THE ACCIDENT, AND THERE WAS A POLICE CAR THERE. [ LUCILLE SOBBING ] SWEETIE... SO I WALKED ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE, AND THERE SHE WAS, IN THE MIDDLE OF HER BED, IN A FETAL POSITION. YOU -- YOUR FATHER'S DEAD. I CAN'T -- I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T TALK -- I DON'T... CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE QUIET? Ronan: MY SISTER HAD GONE IN. MY BROTHER HAD GONE IN. BY THE TIME THAT I CAME INTO HER BEDROOM -- AND MY MOTHER WAS SORT OF TANGLED UP IN THE SHEETS OF HER BED AND HER FACE WAS PUFFY, AND SHE'D BEEN CRYING, AND SHE WAS OUT OF IT. AND IT WAS A VERY STRANGE MOMENT BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HAD HAPPENED. AND THEN, MY BROTHER JUST SAID, "DADDY'S DEAD." MA'AM, I STILL HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT I NEED TO ASK, SO WHY DON'T YOU GET CLEANED UP AND COME ON OUT TO THE LIVING ROOM? Man: IF YOU LOOK AT THE MILLER FAMILY IN 1964, THEY WERE A VERY UPWARDLY MOBILE FAMILY. THESE NEED TO STAY IN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE. I-I I WANT THE FURNITURE TO GET INTO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE. THAT WAY, WE CAN UNPACK BOXES AND ALL... Cork: KIDS, COME ON, COME ON! COME ON OVER HERE. COME HERE. McNamara: CORK MADE A REALLY GOOD LIVING AS A DENTIST. HE MADE SOMETHING LIKE $25,000 A YEAR, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN $200,000 A YEAR BY TODAY'S STANDARDS. Debra: MY FATHER WAS HANDSOME, AND HE WAS FUNNY. LUCILLE! Lucille: WHAT? COME ON, COME ON, COME ON! CORK, I HAVE TO -- NO, COME ON! COME ON. I JUST WANT TO GET A QUICK SHOT. I'M COMING. I'M COMING. OKAY. Ronan: MY MOTHER THOUGHT HE WAS TALENTED, AND SHE THOUGHT HE WAS BEAUTIFUL. OKAY. HERE WE ARE. Debra: SHE HAD ENERGY. LIFE WAS EXCITING TO HER AND MEANT TO BE LIVED. HERE, HONEY, YOU GET IN. GET IN! OKAY, EVERYBODY! RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE, OKAY. UH... FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THE MILLERS HAD BEEN IN THE SAME CLIMB UPWARDS THAT WE ALL WERE TRYING FOR -- A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY, A BIGGER HOUSE, A DREAM LIFE. UH-OH. OH! CORK, I BROKE IT. SHE WANTED DO WELL AND BE A PART OF THE COMMUNITY. Debra: MY MOTHER WAS A SMALL-TOWN GIRL. BUT SHE DIDN'T PERCEIVE HERSELF AS A SMALL-TOWN GIRL. SHE WANTED TO BUILD A HOUSE. * BEAUTIFUL DREAMER, NEVER ALONE * Klinkenborg: THE FARTHER UP INTO THE HILLS YOU ARE, THE WEALTHIER YOU ARE, AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS PROBABLY ASPIRING TO. MY MOTHER HAD A BIG WINDOW PUT IN THE LIVING ROOM THAT YOU COULD SIT IN AND LOOK OUT. SHE LOVED THE VIEW. SHE LOVED THE LIGHTS. * LULLED BY THE MOONLIGHT * Klinkenborg: LUCILLE SUFFERERS FROM SOMETHING THAT I THINK OF AS BEING A PARTICULAR CALIFORNIA AFFLICTION... * BEAUTIFUL DREAMER * ...THIS ANTIPATHY TO THE OLD. YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT HOUSE. YOU CAN'T BUY ANOTHER HOUSE. IT HAS TO BE A NEW HOUSE THAT NOBODY'S EVER LIVED IN BEFORE, ALL THE APPLIANCES ARE UNTOUCHED. SO WE BUILT THIS HOUSE, AND IT WAS A BIG HOUSE FOR US, AND BIGGER THAN ANYTHING WE HAD LIVED IN. * BEAUTIFUL DREAMER * * STILL LOST IN YOUR DREAM * MRS. MILLER, CAN YOU TELL ME HOW LONG YOU'VE HAD THE CAR? OH, ONLY A FEW MONTHS. IT WAS, UM, IT WAS BASICALLY BRAND-NEW. [ SIGHS ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO. THIS HAS JUST BEEN SUCH A TERRIBLE YEAR. YOU KNOW, MY -- MY DEAR FRIEND ELAINE JUST DIED. Ronan: WE WERE VERY CLOSE WITH THE HAYTONS, ARTHWELL AND ELAINE. AND ELAINE HAYTON, WHO WAS ONE OF HER BEST FRIENDS, DIED EARLIER THAT YEAR, AND THAT KIND OF ROCKED MY MOTHER. [ SIGHS ] BEFORE THAT, WE WERE IN THIS REALLY AWFUL CAR ACCIDENT, DEBBIE AND I. [ TIRES SCREECH ] ABOUT FOUR MONTHS BEFORE MY FATHER DIED, MY SISTER AND MY MOTHER HAD BEEN DRIVING ON BANYAN, THE VERY SAME ROAD, AND THEY GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT. THE CAR THAT RAN A STOP SIGN, AND MY SISTER WENT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, AND I BELIEVE MY MOTHER BROKE HER JAW. Debra: I WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY. MY MOTHER THOUGHT I LOST MY EYE BECAUSE IT SLICED MY EYELID. Debra: I JUST CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. IT'S GONNA BE FINE, OKAY? McNamara: THE ACCIDENT REALLY SHOOK UP DEBBIE, AND SHE FIXATED ON THIS WINDY ROAD AND HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS. Debra: AND I SAID, "DADDY, "WHAT ARE THE STATISTICS THAT ANYONE IN OUR FAMILY WOULD EVER HAVE AN ACCIDENT ON BANYAN AGAIN?" THE ODDS -- THEY HAVE TO BE ONE IN A MILLION. I HOPE SO. I KNOW SO. SOMETHING IN MY LITTLE HEART FELT WE WERE HURLING TOWARD SOMETHING TERRIBLE, AND IT WAS LESS THAN SIX MONTHS WHEN HE DIED ON THAT SAME STREET. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] Ronan: SO, AT THE SCENE, THE POLICE ARE LOOKING AT THINGS. AND IT DOESN'T QUITE ADD UP TO WHAT THE STORY THAT MY MOTHER HAD TOLD THEM. YOU HAVE THIS GAS CAN IN THE BACKSEAT THAT DID TOPPLE OVER. HOWEVER, THE MILK CARTONS ARE IN THE BACKSEAT, BUT THEY'RE UPRIGHT. THEY SEE THE SKID MARKS, BUT PUZZLINGLY, THEY'RE STRAIGHT. THEY ARE NOT THE KIND OF SWERVE YOU WOULD IMAGINE. THEY START TO THINK THAT THIS WASN'T AN ACCIDENT... ...BUT THIS WAS, IN FACT, LUCILLE'S PLAN. Ronan: THE THEORY THAT THEY ARRIVE AT IS THAT MY MOTHER HAS PUT MY FATHER TO SLEEP... ...DRIVEN HIM OUT TO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT... ...AND PULLED THE CAR OFF THE ROAD AND GOT OUT AND POURED GASOLINE ON IT. AND THERE WAS A DROP OFF THERE. THEIR IDEA WAS THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO GET THE CAR TO DRIVE OVER IT TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE AUTHENTIC. McNamara: THE PROBLEM, THEY THINK, IS THAT SHE COULDN'T PUSH THE CAR OVER THE EMBANKMENT. Ronan: SHE WAS A SMALL WOMAN. McNamara: AT THIS POINT, SHE'S KIND OF PANICKED. SHE MIGHT BE SEEN. SHE HAS TO DO SOMETHING. THEY SEE THIS LONG BRANCH THAT THEY THINK WAS A TORCH. THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT SHE HAD PICKED UP TO TRY TO HELP HER HUSBAND. AND SO, SHE SETS THE FIRE HERSELF. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] It seems we found a gasoline can inside the vehicle. UH, MRS. MILLER, I THINK WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THIS DOWN AT THE SHERIFF'S STATION. O-OKAY. HER INTERVIEW IS WITH A DETECTIVE PATTERSON. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] HOW DOES IT MAKE SENSE THAT YOU WERE DRIVING IN FIRST GEAR? YOU TOLD THE OFFICERS AT THE SCENE THAT YOU WERE DRIVING AT A PRETTY GOOD CLIP. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT -- WHAT GEAR ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE IN WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING UP A ROAD? Debra: SHE WAS A DINGBAT. SHE'D RUN OUT OF GAS. SHE WOULDN'T PUT OIL IN THE CAR. THE CAR STARTED SMOKING, AND MY DAD WAS FURIOUS, AND IT WAS HER FAULT. YOU HAD ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT I KILLED HIM, AND I SAID NO. THERE -- THERE WILL PROBABLY MOMENTS WHEN I'LL THINK YES, BECAUSE I WAS DRIVING THE CAR, YOU KNOW? THERE WILL PROBABLY BE MOMENTS... YOU KNOW HOW YOU DO. [ CHUCKLES ] BUT I BELIEVE IN BEING PHILOSOPHICAL, IF YOU CAN, ABOUT THINGS RATHER THAN KILLING YOURSELF, YOU KNOW? SHE SAYS SOME RATHER DAMNING THINGS ABOUT HERSELF DURING THAT INTERVIEW THAT JUST AS A PERSON, DON'T MAKE HER LOOK VERY GOOD. IF YOU HAVE ANY EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT MIGHT'VE CAUSED THAT FIRE... I-I REALLY -- I-I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, I-I WAS CONSTANTLY RUNNING OUT OF GAS. [ CHUCKLES ] CORK HAD ME BUY A GAS CAN AND PUT IT IN THE BACK OF THE CAR SO THAT I WOULDN'T RUN OUT ANYMORE. A-AM I -- AM I GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO HOME SOON? LET'S JUST KEEP TALKING. Ronan: SHE'S VERY NAIVE BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES IT'S OVER. SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON. McNamara: POLICE ARREST LUCILLE AT AROUND 12:30. THAT'S A MERE 12 HOURS AFTER THE ACCIDENT. LOOKING INTO THE PURCHASE OF A GAS CAN THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MADE HERE. WOULD'VE BEEN A WOMAN OF ABOUT 35 YEARS OLD, SHOULDER-LENGTH BROWN HAIR. YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING LIKE THAT? YOU KNOW, A COUPLE DAYS AGO, ACTUALLY, UH... Klinkenborg: THIS IS WHERE THE TIMING BECOMES CRITICAL BECAUSE SHE ONLY PURCHASED THE CAN OF GAS A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. THE FIRE HAD BURNED SO BIG AND BRIGHT, ANY GAS INSIDE THE CAR HAD CERTAINLY HELPED IT ALONG. BUT NOW THE QUESTION FOR THOSE POLICEMEN WAS, HAD LUCILLE HELPED IT, TOO? Woman: CORK MILLER WAS JUST 39 YEARS OLD WHEN HE DIED IN THAT HORRIBLE CAR ACCIDENT, BURNED ALIVE. IT WAS TOO AWFUL TO THINK ABOUT. THE POLICE HAD ARRESTED HIS WIFE, LUCILLE, FOR MURDER, BUT JUST AS SOON AS THEY START BUILDING THEIR CASE AGAINST HER... THEY DISCOVER FACTS ABOUT CORK MILLER THAT BEGIN TO UNDERMINE IT. HELLO, MRS. MEYERS. HELLO. HOW'RE YOU TODAY? THEY LEARNED THAT HE HAD A HISTORY OF DEPRESSION. HE WAS A GUY WHO FELT A LOT OF FAMILY PRESSURE TO BE A DENTIST. Debra: HE REALLY WANTED TO BE AN AIRLINE PILOT. THAT WAS HIS DREAM, BUT HE HAD TOO MANY RESPONSIBILITIES. [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYBODY! UH, WE HAVE A LITTLE PERFORMANCE READY FOR YOU. THESE ARE THE HULA-HULA DANCERS, AND WE ARE READY TO GO. AND A-ONE, TWO, THREE. WE ARE GOING TO A LUAU, TO A LUAU, TO... Ronan: MY MOTHER WAS VERY EXTROVERTED AND MY FATHER, VERY INTROVERTED. Debra: I THINK THAT MY FATHER MIGHT'VE MARRIED MY MOTHER TO BRING THE JOY AND WARMTH INTO HIS HEART THAT HE LACKED. HE THOUGHT SHE WOULD MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE, AND HE DIDN'T HAVE IT TO GIVE BACK. DID YOU GET THAT MILLER BANK STATEMENT FOR ME? BUT CORK AND LUCILLE'S DISAPPOINTMENTS WITH EACH OTHER WEREN'T THE ONLY KIND OF PROBLEMS THEY HAD UNDER THEIR ROOF. McNamara: THE EXTERIOR OF THIS SUCCESSFUL DENTIST ACTUALLY HID THE FACT THAT THEY WERE IN DEBT FOR $64,000, WHICH BY TODAY'S STANDARDS WOULD BE ABOUT $0.5 MILLION. Debra: WOMEN DIDN'T WORK, AND SO MY FATHER... THE RESPONSIBILITIES ON HIS SHOULDER WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIM. UH, YEAH, THIS IS, UH, DETECTIVE SHOEMAKER... AFTER HIS DEATH, THE POLICE TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND TOWN WHO KNEW CORK, AND THEY LEARNED THAT ALL THOSE PRESSURES, THE DEBT AND THE FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES, WERE BUILDING UP INSIDE HIM. Ronan: MY FATHER WAS SUFFERING FROM HIS DEPRESSIONS AND HIS MIGRAINES. Klinkenborg: NOW, WE'RE ALL USED TO THE IDEA THAT DEPRESSION IS A DISEASE YOU CAN TREAT. NOT IN 1964. THE ONLY SOLUTIONS, REALLY, ARE BARBITURATES, SEDATIVES, AND CORK MILLER IS BASICALLY SEDATING HIMSELF INTO AS MUCH OBLIVION AS HE CAN GET. Ronan: IT WAS IN THE SUMMER BEFORE MY FATHER DIED. HE TOOK MY BROTHER AND I UP TO THIS POWER STANCHION, AND HE SAT US DOWN. YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU GUYS, RIGHT? YEAH. LOVE YOU, DAD. I PROMISE YOU... WE'RE GONNA BE TOGETHER IN HEAVEN. Ronan: HE WAS SO SAD, AND SO MAYBE THAT WAS JUST IN CASE A SUICIDE HAPPENED. Klinkenborg: AS CORK THINKS ABOUT HIS OWN, REALLY, DESIRE TO EXIT LIFE... HOW WOULD HE PROVIDE FOR HIS FAMILY? [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] Debra: THERE WAS ONE NIGHT THAT I ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED HIM TRYING TO LEAVE THE HOUSE. DEBBIE. DEBBIE, GET THE KEYS, GO INTO YOUR BEDROOM, LOCK THE DOOR, AND DON'T LET HIM IN. I KNEW WHAT "GRAB THE KEYS" MEANT. IT WASN'T A FAMILY SECRET THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO LIVE, AND HE ALWAYS SAID HE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT A CAR ACCIDENT. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] McNamara: THE INSURANCE PAYOUT WAS SOMETHING LIKE $123,000 BECAUSE, IN FACT, HE DID DIE IN AN ACCIDENT. SO THOSE INVESTIGATORS MUST HAVE WONDERED, WAS THIS SOME KIND OF SUICIDE? COULD CORK HAVE ARRANGED EVERYTHING SO THAT HE WOULD DIE... BUT LUCILLE WOULD STILL GET OUT ALIVE? BUT HE WAS IN THE FRONT SEAT, ASLEEP, AND SHE WAS DRIVING. IT SEEMS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT CORK WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO PULL THIS OFF BY HIMSELF. LUCILLE EXPLAINED THAT THE FIRE WAS AN ACCIDENT. POLICE BELIEVED IT LOOKED LIKE A MURDER. BUT WHEN YOU HEARD ABOUT THE MILLERS' LIVES, YOU COULD PIECE TOGETHER A THIRD POSSIBILITY, A PLAN BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. IF SOMEONE YOU LOVED WAS IN THAT MUCH PAIN, MAYBE YOU'D FINALLY AGREE TO HELP THEM END IT. BUT THEN, THE POLICE DISCOVERED THAT LUCILLE MIGHT'VE HAD A MORE SELFISH DESIRE FOR ONE OF HER OTHER DREAMS TO COME TRUE. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL US, HOW LONG HAVE YOU WORKED FOR DR. MILLER? THE POLICE CONTINUED TO TALK TO MORE PEOPLE AROUND TOWN. DID YOU EVER NOTICE ANYTHING UNUSUAL WITH THE FAMILY? WELL, THERE WAS THIS ONE THING. AND THEY REALIZED LUCILLE WAS HARBORING A DEEPER SECRET... ...ONE THAT MAY HAVE GIVEN HER AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MOTIVE. Debra: THE POLICE TALKED TO THE WOMAN WHO RAN MY FATHER'S OFFICE, AND I BELIEVE THAT SHE IS THE ONE WHO TOLD THEM THAT MY MOTHER HAD BEEN HAVING AN AFFAIR. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S MY LITTLE HAWAIIAN MISS AMERICA. COME ON, YOU ARE SUCH A FLATTERER. WHERE DO YOU LEARN THOSE MOVES? I DON'T KNOW. LET ME TELL YOU, WE ARE GONNA TAKE THOSE MOVES TO HAWAII NEXT YEAR, AND NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW. Shh. Ronan: AFTER MY MOTHER'S ARRESTED, ONE OF THE THINGS THEY TURNED UP IS THAT SHE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A PROMINENT ATTORNEY IN SAN BERNARDINO, THE MAN I KNEW AS UNCLE ART, ARTHWELL HAYTON, THE GOOD FRIEND OF THE FAMILY. HIS WIFE, ELAINE, HAD BEEN ONE OF MY MOTHER'S BEST FRIENDS, BUT SHE HAD RECENTLY DIED. TO THE POLICE, THIS AFFAIR BECAME THE MOTIVE, AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION THEY STARTED TO GO. McNamara: THERE WAS MOTEL RECORDS. THERE WAS LUNCH DATES. YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T THE BEST-KEPT SECRET. [ LAUGHTER ] MY FATHER LACKED JOY AND WARMTH, AND THAT CAUSED HER A LOT OF TENSION AND ANGER AND PAIN. THE BECKMANS DOWN THE STREET JUST CLOSED ON THEIR HOUSE, 30% MARKUP. THEY BOUGHT IT TWO YEARS AGO. WOW! Debra: IT WAS A DESPERATION, I THINK. ARTHWELL WAS THE WAY OUT. HE WAS VERY AFFECTIONATE WITH HER. HE COMPLIMENTED HER. HE LAUGHED AND PLAYED AND WAS FUN, AND HE WAS EVERYTHING THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE IN HER MARRIAGE. McNamara: THE POLICE THINK SHE SAW HIM AS, YOU KNOW, "THAT SHOULD BE MY HUSBAND. THAT'S WHO I SHOULD BE HAVING A LIFE WITH." Ronan: THEY QUESTION ARTHWELL. Man: WERE YOU INVOLVED WITH HER ROMANTICALLY? McNamara: HE ADMITS THE AFFAIR BUT SAYS IT'S BEEN OVER FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS. IF MY MOTHER HAD FALLEN IN LOVE AND PERHAPS PROJECTED SOME FUTURE FOR THE TWO OF THEM, ARTHWELL HAD NOT. W-WHEN -- WHAT TIME DID HE LEAVE? NO, THANK YOU. I'LL TRY BACK. Klinkenborg: AS THEY'RE BREAKING UP, THERE WERE DOZENS AND DOZENS AND DOZENS OF PHONE CALLS. I'VE ALREADY LEFT TWO MESSAGES. SO, HE'S GONNA BE GONE ALL WEEKEND? HI, SWEETIE, IT'S AUNT LUCILLE. IS YOUR DADDY HOME? LUCILLE SAYS, "NO MAN HAS EVEN REJECTED ME, AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE THE FIRST." I THINK POLICE TAKE THAT AS, FOR LUCILLE, IT'S NOT OVER AT ALL. AND THEY BELIEVE SHE WANTS ARTHWELL, BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT SHE'S MARRIED TO CORK. Woman: I CAN UNDERSTAND A LITTLE OF WHAT LUCILLE MIGHT'VE BEEN THINKING -- IF I CAN JUST GET THIS ONE THING THAT I WANT, THEN I'LL BE HAPPY. THERE WAS A LOT OF THAT IN OUR PART OF CALIFORNIA BACK THEN. WE REALLY THOUGHT THERE COULD ALWAYS BE A FRESH START. DID YOU EVER TALK IT OVER WITH FRIENDS, THE IDEA THAT MAYBE YOU DIDN'T LOVE YOUR HUSBAND ANYMORE? OH, MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. I -- WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR A PERSONALITY LIKE MINE? WHEN YOU HAVE THEM, YOU THINK YOU DON'T LOVE THEM. YOU -- WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THEM, YOU FEEL FAINT OR SOMETHING. McNamara: FAR FROM HIDING THE SECRET, SHE WAS ACTUALLY VERY OPEN WITH THE POLICE THAT SHE HAD HAD THIS AFFAIR WITH HAYTON AND SAYS IT'S BEEN OVER FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS. TAKE IT FROM ME, IN THOSE DAYS, AN AFFAIR DIDN'T ALWAYS MEAN THE END OF A MARRIAGE. LUCILLE EVEN EXPLAINED TO POLICE THAT CORK KNEW ABOUT THE AFFAIR AND THAT IN THE END, IT HAD BEEN HARD, BUT THEY WORKED THROUGH IT. AND THERE WAS A VERY GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE HER. [ GASPS ] I THOUGHT MOMMY COULD USE A LITTLE TREAT. AND THEN, SHE REVEALED THAT SHE AND CORK HAD SEEN A MARRIAGE COUNSELOR AND THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY DECIDED TO HAVE A FOURTH CHILD. [ BOTH LAUGH ] Ronan: MY MOTHER'S PREGNANT WITH HER FOURTH CHILD WHEN SHE'S ARRESTED. THE FACT THAT IT WAS A PLANNED PREGNANCY, THAT'S ALWAYS SORT OF SEEMED TO ME THAT THEY WERE WORKING THINGS OUT. McNamara: SO THE MOTIVE IS STARTING TO FALL APART HERE. WHY WOULD LUCILLE START MORE OF A FAMILY WITH CORK IF SHE WAS PLANNING TO KILL HIM? IT DIDN'T REALLY ADD UP. BUT BY THIS TIME, THE STORY HAD BEEN IN THE PAPERS FOR MONTHS. THERE WAS NO BACKING DOWN. AND THE PROSECUTION, IT TURNS OUT, HAD ANOTHER DAMNING STORY THEY WERE JUST WAITING TO ROLL OUT, A SHOCKER ABOUT HOW FAR THEY THOUGHT LUCILLE HAD GONE TO REALIZE HER DREAMS. Woman: IT HAD BEEN JUST THREE MONTHS SINCE CORK MILLER HAD DIED IN THAT FIERY WRECK ON BANYAN STREET. AND IN THAT SHORT TIME, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY BUILT A CASE TO BRING HIS WIDOW, LUCILLE MILLER, TO TRIAL FOR MURDER. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] Ronan: THE IDEA IS THAT MY MOTHER HAS A GRAND SCHEME, AND THAT IS TO ULTIMATELY GET ARTHWELL HAYTON. McNamara: ACCORDING TO THE PROSECUTION, IF SHE COULD JUST GET CORK OUT OF THE WAY, ARTHWELL WOULD COME BACK TO HER, AND IT WOULD ALL WORK OUT. THE PROSECUTION MAINTAINED IT HAD TO BE ARSON... ...AND THEY HAD AN ARSON EXPERT RECREATE THE ACCIDENT. Woman: AND THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT LOOKED VERY BAD FOR LUCILLE -- ALL THE SUSPICIOUS DETAILS OF THAT NIGHT, THE SKID MARKS, THE GAS CAN... A LONG BRANCH WITH A BURNT END. THE DEFENSE AGREED THAT SHE SPENT A LOT AND THAT SHE HAD THIS AFFAIR... BUT THEY DIDN'T THINK THAT ADDED UP TO A MURDERER. THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS A WOMAN WHO GOT INTO A BAD MARRIAGE YOUNG, WAS A LITTLE FLIGHTY, BUT IT DIDN'T MEAN SHE HAD ICE WATER IN HER VEINS. THE ARSON EXPERTS FOR THE DEFENSE SAID THAT, ACTUALLY, THE FUEL LINE HAD DRIPPED FUEL ONTO THE CARBURETOR... AND THAT WAS THE EXPLOSION. BUT REALLY, AND LUCILLE'S LAWYERS POINTED THIS OUT, HOW COULD ANYONE COME UP WITH SUCH AN ELABORATE SCHEME AND THINK THEY COULD PULL OFF ALL THE DETAILS OF THAT NIGHT? IT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. IT SEEMS LIKE TOO COMPLICATED OF A PLAN. WHY DID SHE WAKE UP HER DAUGHTER TO ALERT HER THAT THEY WERE LEAVING THE HOUSE IF SHE HAD A PLAN TO MURDER HER HUSBAND? NEITHER SIDE SEEMS TO ADD UP IN THE WAY IT SHOULD. BUT THERE'S JUST THIS QUESTION, CAN WE BELIEVE LUCILLE? JUST WHAT KIND OF WOMAN WAS SHE? UP IN THAT BIG, NEW HOUSE ON THE HILL, LUCILLE, WHO DIDN'T WANT A LITTLE LIFE. AND THEN, THE PROSECUTION PULLED A MOVE OUTSIDE THE COURT ROOM. THEY GOT A STORY IN THE PAPERS ABOUT LUCILLE. WASN'T EVIDENCE, BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, IT REALLY TURNED OUR HEADS AND MADE YOU WONDER, WHAT WAS THIS WOMAN CAPABLE OF? THE PROSECUTION LEAKED THAT ARTHWELL HAYTON'S WIFE, ELAINE, HAD DIED UNDER SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES, AND THAT, IN FACT, THE LAST PERSON WITH ELAINE BEFORE SHE DIED... ...WAS LUCILLE. ARTHWELL HAYTON HAD TAKEN HIS BOAT TO CATALINA. THE NEXT MORNING, ELAINE IS FOUND DEAD IN HER BED. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] Ronan: ONCE THE STORY'S OUT THERE, IT'S IN EVERYONE'S MIND. McNamara: BUT IN FACT, ELAINE HAYTON HAD BEEN ILL AND MAY HAVE JUST DIED NATURALLY. Ronan: THEY DON'T EVER PROSECUTE HER FOR ELAINE'S MURDER. THE PROSECUTOR GOT THAT OUT THERE AND THEN MOVED ON AND JUST LEFT IT ALONE, BUT I BELIEVE IT DID HAVE THE EFFECT HE WAS HOPING FOR. SO HAD CORK'S DEATH BEEN LUCILLE'S PLAN? A MURDER, MAYBE EVEN A MERCY KILLING. OR WAS SHE A VICTIM, A WOMAN DEVASTATED BY THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND IN A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT AND THEN ACCUSED OF CAUSING IT? HOWEVER MANY UNCERTAINTIES HUNG IN THE AIR, IT WAS FINALLY TIME FOR AN END, AT LEAST IN THE EYES OF THE LAW. LUCILLE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF MURDER AND SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. BUT DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOKED AT IT, WELL, YOU COULD BELIEVE THAT WASN'T RIGHT, EITHER. BASED ON THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, I DO THINK IT WAS TOO CIRCUMSTANTIAL. THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN EYEWITNESS. IF I WERE ON THAT JURY, I WOULD NOT HAVE CONVICTED HER. MY CONCLUSION IS THAT SHE WAS CAPABLE OF IT. I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING REALLY DEEPLY FRACTURED INSIDE HER. I THINK THAT HOLE BETWEEN HER RATIONAL THOUGHT AND HER INSTINCTS, HER DESIRE, WAS IMMENSE. Ronan: MY MOTHER MAINTAINED HER INNOCENCE TILL THE END OF HER LIFE. SHE NEVER WAVERED ABOUT THAT. SHE NEVER SLIPPED. I TRY TO ADD UP THE PERSON THAT I KNEW THAT WAS MY MOTHER. I JUST DON'T KNOW. SHE MAY HAVE BEEN A SNEAK, BUT A KILLER IS JUST ONE OF THE THINGS SHE WASN'T, AND I THINK THE PROSECUTION HAS AN EASY CASE TO MAKE BECAUSE IT'S A STORY OF GREED AND INFIDELITY GONE WRONG. BUT WE'RE ALL IN DEBT, WE ALL HAVE DREAMS THAT AREN'T BECOMING FULFILLED, AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WAS PRESENTED ON HER SIDE. THE COMPLEXITIES OF A LIFE WEREN'T SHOWN, BUT THE SIMPLICITY OF A MURDER WAS. WE'LL NEVER GET MORE FACTS OR DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OUT ON LONESOME BANYAN STREET IN 1964. SO ALL YOU'RE LEFT WITH IS A COMPLICATED STORY ABOUT CORK AND LUCILLE MILLER AND THE DREAMS THEY DREAMED FOR AWHILE. AND YOU CAN WONDER, DID ALL THAT SUNSHINE AND POSSIBILITY TURN DESIRE INTO SOMETHING DANGEROUS AND DEADLY? Debra: SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT. IT'S COMPLEX, AND IT IS AMBIGUOUS. AND SHE WAS GOOD AND BAD, AND SHE MAYBE WAS A BAD WOMAN WHO DIDN'T COMMIT A MURDER. I DON'T NEED TO LOOK AT HER AS GUILTY OR INNOCENT ANYMORE. SHE'S JUST MY MOM, AND I LOVED HER. I DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYMORE. * BEAUTIFUL DREAMER * * NEVER ALONE * * STARLIGHT AND MOONBEAMS ARE GUIDING YOU HOME * * ALL OF YOUR WORRIES * * THAT FILL UP THE DAY * * LULLED BY THE MOONLIGHT * * HAVE ALL GONE AWAY *
