 [ CRICKETS CHIRPING ] [ OWL HOOTING ] Woman: PEOPLE IN INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI, DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF SECRETS BACK THEN. BUT IF YOU DID WANNA KEEP SOMETHING SECRET, YOU'D NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE REALLY PRIVATE. WHY DO YOU THINK EVERY TOWN HAS A LOVERS' LANE? OH, I PARKED OUT THERE WITH MY FAIR SHARE OF SWEETHEARTS. IT WAS ALWAYS NICE AND QUIET WITH NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT.

 BUT IF NO ONE'S AROUND TO SEE YOU, YOU CAN ALSO BET THERE'S NO ONE AROUND TO HEAR YOU SCREAM. [ RADIO CHATTER ] Peebles: IN 1960, KANSAS CITY WAS SURROUNDED BY ALL THESE SMALLER COMMUNITIES LIKE INDEPENDENCE WITH A LOT OF STRUGGLING FARMERS. THE ABANDONED CRILL FARM ON PHELPS ROAD IS A NOTORIOUS LOVERS' LANE. PEOPLE WENT THERE TO HAVE SEX. AND THEY WENT THERE TO HAVE AFFAIRS. [ CAR DOOR SHUTS ] [ CAMERA SHUTTERS ] A LITTLE BIT AFTER MIDNIGHT ON MAY 28TH,

 DETECTIVE JAMES BROWNING RECEIVED A CALL ABOUT A BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN. Browning: JEEZ. Kilgariff: SHE'S GOT FOUR BULLET WOUNDS, ONE ON EITHER SIDE OF HER NECK DOWN BY HER COLLARBONE, ONE UP ON THE LEFT SIDE OF HER FACE... [ RADIO CHATTER ] ...AND ONE IN HER ABDOMEN. THE POLICE ALSO NOTICE GUNPOWDER BURNS ON THE HEM OF HER SKIRT. THE TIP OF THE GUN WAS DIRECTLY ON THE BODY. HER DRESS WAS PULLED UP ABOVE HER WAIST. HER UNDERWEAR WAS RIPPED OFF. Kilgariff: WHICH LEADS THE POLICE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN A RAPE AND MURDER. NEARBY IN THE GRASS, THE POLICE DISCOVER A PURSE. PATRICIA JONES. Woman: PAT JONES HAD BEEN THE LUCKIEST GIRL IN INDEPENDENCE. SURE SEEMED THAT WAY TO ME. EVERY WISH A GIRL KISSED AND PUT AWAY IN HER HOPE CHEST HAD COME TRUE FOR PAT. AFTER HER HUSBAND, WALT, GOT OUT OF THE SERVICE, HE GOT A GOOD JOB AS A CAR SALESMAN. THEY ALWAYS HAD A NICE, NEW MODEL PARKED OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE. NOT TO MENTION HER KIDS, A SWEET BOY, JERRY, AND A LITTLE GIRL, CINDY, ONE OF EACH, YOU KNOW. IT WAS TERRIBLE. PAT WOULD NEVER GET TO SEE THEM GROW UP. Peebles: FOR A YOUNG WOMAN WITH SUCH HIGH HOPES FOR HER LIFE TO BE MURDERED, IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN IN INDEPENDENCE. AND DETECTIVE BROWNING IS THE PERSON WHO'S GONNA HAVE TO CARRY THAT WEIGHT. LITTLE DID HE KNOW AT THE TIME, BUT IT WOULD COMPLETELY CHANGE HIS LIFE. Man: WHAT DO YOU THINK, SIR? I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S SOMETHING OFF. THOSE... STAND IN FRONT OF ME. OKAY, USE YOUR HAND AS A -- AS A GUN. ALL RIGHT. YEP. YEAH. YES. OKAY. SHE'D BE LOWER THAN ME. SOME OF THE WOUNDS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN FIRED AT A DOWNWARD ANGLE... NOW GET DOWN FURTHER. AS IF SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON HER KNEES. THE PERSON MIGHT HAVE BEEN STANDING OVER HER. THIS WAS AN EXECUTION. THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND ANY SHELL CASINGS. THE KILLER CLEANED UP THIS SCENE. MAYBE THIS IS A PREMEDITATED MURDER. THEY EVENTUALLY DID FIND A BULLET THAT WENT THROUGH THE ABDOMEN AND LODGED INTO THE GROUND FROM A 22-CALIBER PISTOL. HOW DO YOU SPELL BOLDIZS? B-O-L-D-I-Z-S. A YOUNG MAN BY THE NAME OF JOHN BOLDIZS HAD DISCOVERED THE BODY. AND HOW DID YOU COME TO FIND HER OUT HERE? I HAD TO ANSWER A CALL OF NATURE. AND THEN I SAW HER ON THE GROUND OUT THERE. THAT'S WHEN I WENT TO THE FILLING STATION, AND I CALLED YOU. WAS IT DARK? YEAH. THAT'S WHY I HAD TO GO OUT THERE A LITTLE BIT. WAS ANYONE ELSE PARKED OUT HERE AT THE TIME? NO, NO. IT WAS JUST ME AND -- AND THE LADY I FOUND, OBVIOUSLY. AND JOHN, WHY WALK ALL THE WAY OUT THERE IF NO ONE WAS AROUND TO SEE YOU? WERE YOU FEELING SHY? YEAH, UH, I GET SHY. Kilgariff: OFFICER JONES IMMEDIATELY SMELLS A RAT. Peebles: IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE A WHOLE LOTTA SENSE THAT HE WOULD JUST HAPPEN TO STOP... YOU BETTER COME ON DOWN TO THE STATION SO W- WE CAN TALK SOME MORE. ...AND THAT HE WOULD SEE THE BODY, THAT FAR INTO THE GRASS. [ DOOR OPENS ] Man: PATRICIA'S HUSBAND, WALTER JONES, IS BROUGHT DOWN TO THE POLICE STATION AT ABOUT 5 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. Kilgariff: HE'S 23 YEARS OLD AND AN EX-MARINE. ONCE AGAIN, I AM VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. UH, THANKS. WALTER JONES IS OBVIOUSLY IN A STATE OF SHOCK. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW PATRICIA? IT WAS THURSDAY MORNING WHEN I LEFT FOR WORK. FROM WHAT I CAN SEE HERE, YOU CALLED YOUR WIFE IN AS A MISSING PERSON YESTERDAY, FRIDAY EVENING? THAT'S RIGHT. SO WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL US WHEN SHE DIDN'T COME HOME THURSDAY NIGHT? Y-YOU HAVE A LITTLE ONE, YES? IS IT NORMAL FOR HIS MOTHER TO STAY OUT ALL NIGHT? NO. I THOUGHT SHE WAS TRYING TO TEACH ME A LESSON. WE HAD A FIGHT WHEN I GOT HOME LATE FROM WORK ON WEDNESDAY. SHE GETS MAD ABOUT MY HOURS. HOW LATE DID YOU GET HOME? ABOUT 11:00, 11:30. YOU'RE A CAR SALESMAN, YES? YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. DO YOU SELL A LOT OF CARS AT 11 AT NIGHT? NO, BUT THERE'S -- THERE'S PAPERWORK. WALTER, ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR? WALTER, ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR? I SOLD HER A THUNDERBIRD ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO. WALTER SAID HIS MISTRESS HAD JUST COME INTO A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY. AND SHE WANTED TO BUY HERSELF A THUNDERBIRD. WALTER SOLD HER A CAR, AND, APPARENTLY, ALSO SOLD HER HIMSELF, BECAUSE THEY STARTED DATING. IT WAS A LARK, A MISTAKE. ALL RIGHT, LET ME TELL YOU, THOUGH, SHARON'S A NUT. ALL RIGHT? CLAIMING SHE'S IN LOVE. ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT, I WENT OVER TO HER PLACE. A-AT FIRST, IT WAS NORMAL. AND THEN SHE TRIES TO TELL ME SHE'S HAVING MY BABY AND THAT I SHOULD LEAVE MY FAMILY. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? Peebles: WALTER JONES TOLD HIS MISTRESS, "YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN REALLY BELIEVE YOU'RE PREGNANT. AND I'M NOT LEAVING MY WIFE." GOOD-BYE. SO WEDNESDAY NIGHT, HE BROKE IT OFF WITH HER. WHEN I GOT BACK, PAT WAS FUMING. ALL RIGHT? SHE GUESSED THAT I WAS STEPPING OUT ON HER. THAT'S WHY WE FOUGHT THAT NIGHT. SHE WAS STILL PRETTY STEAMED WHEN SHE LEFT FOR WORK THE NEXT DAY. WHEN SHE DIDN'T COME HOME THAT EVENING, I CALLED THE PEOPLE SHE CARPOOLED WITH, THE -- THE HURSTS. TH-THEY TOLD ME THIS CRAZY STORY. [ CAR HORN HONKS ] THURSDAY AT WORK, PATRICIA GETS A CALL FROM A MYSTERY WOMAN WHO SAYS, "MY SISTER IS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH YOUR HUSBAND." SO SHE ASKS PATRICIA TO MEET HER AT HIGHWAY 24 AND NORTH LIBERTY STREET. TH-THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF IT, BUT APPARENTLY PAT INSISTED. A-AND THEY WATCHED HER GET IN THE CAR WITH THE WOMAN. UH, IT HAD TO BE SHARON. SO I WENT OVER TO HER PLACE ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND THEN CONFRONTED HER. WHAT THE HELL'S YOUR PROBLEM? Sharon: WALT. Rizzo: SHARON ADMITTED THAT, "YES, I TOLD HER ABOUT THE AFFAIR. SHE DIDN'T SEEM OVERLY UPSET." I'M SURE IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. SHE TOLD ME THAT PAT HAD GONE TO COOL OFF, PROBABLY CHECKED INTO A MOTEL FOR THE NIGHT. Sharon: DON'T YOU THINK SO? I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I BELIEVED HER. ALL RIGHT? BUT THIS GIRL HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS. I KNOW IT. UH, WHAT'S THE WOMAN'S FULL NAME? SHARON... SHARON KINNE. SHARON KINNE? YEAH. SHE LIVES OVER ON EAST 26TH STREET. EXCUSE US FOR A MINUTE. WHERE'S THE FIRE? YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY SHOULD PUT A PICTURE OR TWO UP IN HERE, MAYBE GET YOUR OWN. WHAT'S THE, UH, BIG HULLABALOO ABOUT SUSAN? NO, SHARON. SHARON KINNE. YOU REMEMBER? SHE'S THE YOUNG GIRL I QUESTIONED 2 MONTHS AGO AFTER HER HUSBAND DIED IN HIS BED. Kilgariff: SHARON KINNE IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL 20-YEAR-OLD WOMAN. WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED? WE WERE GONNA GO TO SUPPER AT CHURCH. HE WANTED TO REST HIS EYES BEFORE WE WENT. I WENT TO THE BATHROOM TO GET READY. I COULD -- I COULD HEAR CATHERINE IN THERE. AND I HEARD HER ASK, "DADDY, HOW DOES THIS THING WORK?" AND THEN I HEARD A SOUND. [ CAMERAS SHUTTERING ] Rizzo: SHARON TOLD INVESTIGATORS THAT THEIR DAUGHTER ACCIDENTALLY SHOT AND KILLED HER DAD. THE GIRL HAD PLAYED WITH TOY GUNS BEFORE. Peebles: JAMES KINNE WAS SHOT IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD. AND THE RIGHT PILLOW HAD GUNSHOT BURNS. Browning: YOU REMEMBER? RIGHT. JAMES KINNE, .22 PISTOL. YES. IN THE SUMMER OF 1956, SHARON MEETS JAMES KINNE AT A CHURCH SOCIAL. HE WAS 21. AND SHE WAS 16. Kilgariff: THEY HAD A WHIRLWIND ROMANCE, AND THEY ENDED UP MARRYING THAT FALL. SHARON GOT PREGNANT, AND SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER. [ CHILD CRYING ] Sharon: CATHERINE, COME HERE. ARE YOU CRYING? Rizzo: THE LITTLE GIRL IS TOO YOUNG TO TELL THE COPS WHAT HAPPENED. THERE WAS NO PARAFFIN TEST TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY GUN RESIDUE. THE POLICE DIDN'T WANNA SUBJECT THE MOTHER AND THE CHILD TO HAVING HOT WAX POURED ON THEIR HANDS. HOWEVER, SERGEANT BROWNING KNOWS THAT SHARON IS GOING TO GET SOME LIFE INSURANCE, ABOUT $230,000 IN TODAY'S MONEY. THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT WAS TO IMAGINE. I MEAN, THAT LITTLE GIRL ACTUALLY PICKING UP THAT GUN AND PHYSICALLY BEING ABLE TO PULL THAT TRIGGER? SHE'S A TINY, LITTLE THING. NOBODY WANTED TO BELIEVE IT WAS ANYTHING MORE THAN A TRAGIC ACCIDENT, BUT WE HAD TO MAKE SURE IT WAS POSSIBLE. Peebles: TWO DAYS LATER, DETECTIVES GO BACK. THEY HAVE AN UNLOADED .22 PISTOL TO SEE IF, IN FACT, THE CHILD CAN PULL THE TRIGGER. SHARON DIDN'T WANNA PUT HER DAUGHTER THROUGH THAT, BUT SHE RELENTED. GO AHEAD, HONEY, JUST LIKE DADDY SHOWED YOU, COWBOYS AND INDIANS. AND THE TODDLER ACTUALLY CLICKS THE SAFETY ON AND OFF A COUPLE TIMES. OKAY. THANK YOU, SWEETIE. Rizzo: THEY RULE IT AN ACCIDENT. Browning: AND NOW IT'S, WHAT, NOT 2 MONTHS AFTER HER HUSBAND IS SHOT IN THE HEAD WITH A .22 PISTOL. AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND'S WIFE SHOWS UP MURDERED WITH, OH, WAIT, YOU DON'T SAY, A .22 PISTOL AFTER MEETING UP WITH SHARON KINNE. D-DO YOU BELIEVE IN THAT MUCH COINCIDENCE? NOT IN THIS LIFE. NEITHER DO I. SO THE -- THE OTHER GUY, THE, UM, ONE THAT OFFICER JONES SAID WASN'T EXACTLY THE BRIGHTEST BULB, WHERE HE'S IN ALL THIS? JONES SAID HE TALKED TO HIM AT THE SCENE, AND HE WAS DEAD SURE THE MOPE WAS LYING ABOUT HOW HE FOUND THE BODY. LET'S FIND OUT. Browning: SO YOU JUST HAPPENED TO STOP. AND THEN, IN THE DARK, YOU SAW 50 FEET INTO THE TALL GRASS, AND YOU SPOTTED A BODY? UH, DRIVING HELPS ME CLEAR MY HEAD. BUT THEN I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD TO PEE. YOU REMEMBERED THAT, DID YOU? YEAH. THAT'S YOUR ACTUAL STORY? Man: YOU NEED TO COME CLEAN. THIS IS A MURDER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. [ SIGHS ] OKAY. I WASN'T ALONE. Kilgariff: UNDER PRESSURE, JOHN BOLDIZS ADMITS THAT, IN FACT, HE WAS WITH A WOMAN THAT HE'D BEEN DATING OFF AND ON SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. JOHN SAID TO HER, "I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE GO OUT TO LOVERS' LANE." SHE SPOTTED SOMETHING OUT IN THE GRASS. AND THAT'S WHEN I FOUND THE LADY. SO THIS, UH, WOMAN YOU WERE DATING, WHERE WAS SHE WHEN THE POLICE ARRIVED? SHE WAS NERVOUS. HIS ON-AND-OFF-AGAIN GIRLFRIEND SAYS, "I'M THE LAST PERSON THAT SAW HER ALIVE. YOU HAVE TO TAKE ME HOME." AND SO HE TAKES HER HOME, AND THEN HE CALLS THE POLICE. SHE SAID THAT? NOW, LET ME JUST TAKE A WILD GUESS. IS YOUR GIRLFRIEND SHARON KINNE? YEAH. DO YOU KNOW HER? Woman: EVEN THOUGH WE BOTH GREW UP RIGHT IN INDEPENDENCE, I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW SHARON. ONE OF MY GIRLFRIENDS WENT TO SCHOOL WITH HER, THOUGH, BACK WHEN SHE WAS JUST SHARON HALL. SHE SAID THAT SHARON ALWAYS HAD HER NOSE IN A MOVIE MAGAZINE, THAT IT SEEMED LIKE SHE NEVER TALKED ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT HOW SHE WAS GOING TO MOVE TO NEW YORK OR HOLLYWOOD, ANYWHERE BUT INDEPENDENCE, REALLY. JAMES KINNE WAS GOING TO STUDY ENGINEERING AT BYU. AND I GUESS SHARON FIGURED UTAH WAS AT LEAST ON THE WAY TO CALIFORNIA. BUT JAMES KINNE DROPS OUT OF BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY. AND THEY MOVE BACK TO INDEPENDENCE. Rizzo: JAMES KINNE AND HIS PARENTS ARE DEVOUT MEMBERS OF THE LDS CHURCH. SHARON IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH, BUT SHE AGREED TO CONVERT. Peebles: THEY CONSIDERED IT NOT TO BE AN IDEAL MARRIAGE FOR THEIR SON, WHO THEY WANTED TO HAVE A TRADITIONAL MORMON WIFE. SOME ACCOUNTS SAID THAT SHE ALWAYS HAD DREAMS OF SOMEONE COMING TO TAKE HER OUT OF INDEPENDENCE. SO SHE HAD HER DREAM, AND THEN IT WAS SQUASHED. ON SATURDAY, MAY 28TH, DETECTIVE BROWNING GOES DIRECTLY TO SHARON KINNE'S HOUSE. MRS. KINNE, HOW ARE YOU? HELLO, DETECTIVE BROWNING. DETECTIVE BROWNING. YES, HI. YES. WE MET 2 MONTHS AGO. YEAH, IT'S BEEN A WHILE. YEAH, A LITTLE BIT. YEAH, UM, THERE'S -- HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? I'VE BEEN FINE. IF IT'S ALL RIGHT, WE'D LIKE YOU TO COME DOWN TO THE STATION. WE JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. Kilgariff: SHE HAS ALL THESE EXCUSES WHY SHE CAN'T GO TO THE POLICE STATION WITH HIM. Peebles: SHE STARTS PEPPERING HIM WITH QUESTIONS. "IS THIS ABOUT MY HUSBAND? I THOUGHT THIS WAS OVER." AND HIS RESPONSE IS, "I NEED TO TAKE YOU IN FOR QUESTIONING." IF I COME DOWNTOWN, WHO'S GONNA WATCH MY DAUGHTER? HOW YOU DOING, SWEETIE? YOU OKAY? [ LAUGHTER IN DISTANCE ] Kilgariff: THEY STOP AT THIS HAIR SALON. HER KID NEEDS A BABYSITTER, AND SHARON'S MOM'S IN THERE GETTING HER HAIR DONE. Peebles: AND HE'S THINKING, "WHY AM I SITTING HERE? [ CAR HORN HONKS ] AND HOW DID SHE CONVINCE ME TO LET HER DO THIS?" [ DOOR BELLS RING ] DETECTIVE BROWNING, MY MOTHER'S HAIR IS NOT QUITE SET YET. IT'LL ONLY BE ANOTHER 20 MINUTES OR SO. OR SO -- I CAN'T WATCH HER WITH THE DRYER ON. IT MAKES TOO MUCH NOISE. I CAN'T HEAR HER. Sharon: ABSOLUTELY. AND IT'S NO PLACE FOR A LITTLE GIRL. I CAN'T EXPECT THE OTHER LADIES Browning: GET IN THE CAR. TO WATCH HER. SHE'S MY RESPONSIBILITY. NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS. IT IS RIDICULOUS. YOU'RE RIGHT. OKAY, CATHERINE? SAY GOOD-BYE TO MOMMY. IT'S TIME TO GO. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU HAVE TO BE SO SOUR. SOMEBODY WOKE UP ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BED. GET IN THE CAR. ALL RIGHT. FINE. CATHERINE, SWEETIE, COME ON, HONEY. COME ON, YOU'RE GONNA SPEND THE AFTERNOON WITH GRANDMA, OKAY? YOU'RE GONNA GO WITH GRANDMA. I DON'T REMEMBER HIM BEING SO GRUMPY. WHO THE HELL IS THIS WOMAN? SO... TELL ME ABOUT HOW YOU MET PATRICIA JONES. WHO'S THAT? SHE'S WALTER JONES' WIFE. NOW, WE BOTH KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WALTER. OH. IS THAT THE MAN WHO SOLD ME MY THUNDERBIRD? WELL, THEN, YES. HE'S A CAR SALESMAN. WELL, HE TOLD US YOU'VE BEEN HAVING AN AFFAIR THAT STARTED SHORTLY AFTER YOUR HUSBAND DIED. [ SIGHS ] I WAS FEELING VULNERABLE AFTER JAMES. WE WENT OUT A COUPLE OF TIMES. HIT UP A DUD. IS THAT SO? [ LAUGHS ] 'CAUSE HE SAID THAT, ON WEDNESDAY, YOU TOLD HIM THAT YOU WERE PREGNANT, THAT YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH HIM AND THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE HIS WIFE. HE WAS IN LOVE WITH ME. WHAT A LIAR. Peebles: IF SHE IS PREGNANT WITH WALTER JONES' CHILD, THIS WOULD GIVE HER MOTIVE TO ELIMINATE PATRICIA JONES. THAT'S WHY I BROKE IT OFF WITH HIM. HE'S DISHONEST. ALL RIGHT. NOW THAT YOU REMEMBER WALTER, MAYBE THAT'S JOGGED YOUR MEMORY ABOUT PATRICIA. BECAUSE HER CO-WORKERS SAW HER GET IN A CAR WITH YOU ON THE DAY SHE DISAPPEARED. OH, THAT. WELL, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I FELT BAD FOR HER. SHE ADMITS THAT SHE DID ARRANGE TO MEET PATRICIA JONES AND DROVE AROUND WITH HER AND TOLD HER THAT, UH, HER SISTER WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH WALT. SO WHY DID YOU SAY IT WAS YOUR SISTER HAVING THE AFFAIR AND NOT YOU? I WANTED HER TO BE MAD AT WALT, NOT ME. HE'S THE CHEATER. AFTER SHE DROPPED OFF PATRICIA, A COUPLE OF BLOCKS FROM HER HOUSE, A LITTLE BIT BEFORE 6, SHARON'S STORY IS THAT SHE THEN MET HER BROTHER CLOSE TO 7 TO RUN SOME ERRANDS FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY. JOHN BOLDIZS, HE'S ANOTHER YOUNG MAN THAT YOU -- YOU GO ON DATES WITH, RIGHT, WHERE -- WHERE YOU GO PARKING? [ LAUGHS ] YOU'RE ADORABLE. YES. JOHN'S A GOOD FRIEND. JOHN TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HIM HELP YOU GO LOOKING FOR PATRICIA AND THAT, TOGETHER, YOU FOUND HER BODY AFTER SHE HAD BEEN SHOT AND MURDERED WITH A 22-CALIBER PISTOL. WELL, THAT'S JUST THE THING. YOU SEE, WHEN WALT FOUND OUT I TOLD PAT ABOUT HIM CHEATING ON HER, HE WAS JUST SO ANGRY. WHAT THE HELL'S YOUR PROBLEM? WALT. YELLING, A MANIAC. Kilgariff: ALTHOUGH SHE TOLD WALTER THAT IT'LL BE FINE, SHARON CLAIMS THAT ALL OF THAT WAS SO UPSETTING TO HER THAT, THE NEXT NIGHT, SHE CALLED JOHN BOLDIZS AND SAID, "YOU HAVE TO HELP ME FIND MY FRIEND." SHARON... YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON SEEN WITH PATRICIA JONES. AND YOU WERE THE ONE WHO FOUND HER BODY. THAT IS A HELL OF A COINCIDENCE. IT WAS JOHN'S IDEA TO PARK THERE, NOT MINE. BUT I'M SURE HE ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE PARK OUT THERE. IT COULD'VE BEEN ANYONE WHO REPORTED PATRICIA JONES. BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, DETECTIVE BROWNING. IT IS JUST THE CRAZIEST COINCIDENCE. I NEED TO GET STARTED ON DINNER. Peebles: THE GALL THAT SHE HAS... I, UH, TAKE IT FROM THE LACK OF HANDCUFFS, SHE FELL SHORT OF CONFESSING. SHE SET UP HER IDIOT LACKEY, BOLDIZS, TO TELL US IT WAS HIS IDEA TO PARK THERE. SHE PLANNED THAT. WHEN JAMES KINNE WAS SHOT, I LET MYSELF GET TAKEN IN BY THAT GIRL. NO PARAFFIN TEST, THAT WAS A MISTAKE. AND NOW PATRICIA JONES IS DEAD, AND THAT'S ON ME. NOBODY ELSE IS GONNA DIE. I'M GOING TO WIPE THAT DERANGED SMIRK RIGHT OFF OF HER FACE. MARK MY WORDS. I WILL PERSONALLY PUT HER BEHIND BARS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. NO MORE MISTAKES. BIG MISTAKE ON THE AUTOPSY OF PATRICIA JONES. SOMEHOW, THE CORONER'S DEPARTMENT LET HER BODY GET TAKEN STRAIGHT TO THE FUNERAL HOME. SO SHE WAS WASHED AND EMBALMED BEFORE THEY DID ANY TESTS. WHAT? THE CORONER BOTCHED THE AUTOPSY. Rizzo: THEY LOST ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT BE THERE. Woman: DAMNED IF THAT SHARON KINNE DIDN'T KEEP DRAWING ACES. BROWNING WAS UP AGAINST ONE HELL OF A GAMBLER, LIKE NOTHING HE'D EVER SEEN BEFORE. AND SHARON WASN'T DONE PLAYING HER GAME, NOT BY A LONG SHOT. Rizzo: INVESTIGATORS SEARCH SHARON KINNE'S HOUSE. JAMES. YEAH? Peebles: THEY DO FIND A BOX THAT A 22-CALIBER PISTOL CAME IN. THE GUN WAS PURCHASED 2 WEEKS BEFORE PATRICIA JONES WAS MURDERED. WHERE IS IT? Rizzo: BUT THEY DON'T FIND THE GUN. THEY BRING SHARON IN. SHE CLAIMED THAT SHE HAD LOST THE GUN WHILE SHE WAS ON AN OUT-OF-TOWN TRIP ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE PATRICIA WAS KILLED. SHE DIDN'T MENTION THE GUN, SHE SAYS, BECAUSE IT SLIPPED HER MIND. Peebles: AND SHE WISHES SHE COULD PRODUCE IT SO IT WOULD CLEAR HER NAME. Kilgariff: SHARON IS INTERROGATED FOR 13 HOURS. SHE WAS SMUG. SHE'S ABRASIVE. SHE'S IMPERVIOUS TO THESE TACTICS, LIKE IT'S A GAME TO HER. THE FEAR IS, WE'VE GOTTA GET THIS WOMAN OFF THE STREET BEFORE SHE KILLS SOMEBODY ELSE. Rizzo: DESPITE THE LACK OF ANY KIND OF DIRECT EVIDENCE, THEY TOOK A BOLD STEP AND CHARGED HER WITH BOTH THE MURDERS OF PATRICIA JONES AND JAMES KINNE. [ HANDCUFFS CLICK ] Woman: SHARON KINNE WAS FRONT-PAGE NEWS FOR MONTHS. MY MOTHER AND HER FRIENDS COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT. HER TRIAL GOT DELAYED, BECAUSE SHE WASN'T LYING ABOUT BEING PREGNANT. THEY WAITED FOR HER TO GIVE BIRTH TO A BABY GIRL THAT SHE INSISTED WAS JAMES' CHILD, EVEN THOUGH THE STORK CAME 10 MONTHS AFTER HE WAS SHOT. Kilgariff: SHE LOVED THE ATTENTION. SHE BASKED IN IT. IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHARON. Peebles: NOW, SHE'S A STAR. IT WAS KIND OF LIKE THIS OCEAN TIDE THAT JUST SWALLOWED UP THE TRAGEDY OF PATRICIA JONES. MY FATHER, ALEX PEEBLES, WAS THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR SHARON KINNE. THE WORD ON THE STREET WAS, IF YOU WANTED TO GET OUT OF IT, AND YOU HAD THE MONEY, THEN YOU WENT TO QUINN AND PEEBLES. Rizzo: SOME PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED THAT, AMONGST HER STRONGEST SUPPORTERS WERE HER FORMER IN-LAWS. THEY MADE IT KNOWN THAT THEY DIDN'T THINK SHE DID IT. DETECTIVE BROWNING KNOWS THAT, BEHIND THE SCENES, THEY DON'T REALLY LIKE HER VERY MUCH. THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY HERE. Peebles: THE KINNES ARE DEVOTED GRANDPARENTS. Rizzo: SHARON RESTRICTED ACCESS FOR THEM. Peebles: ALEX, MY DAD, WENT TO THEM AND SAID, "IF YOU SUPPORT HER PUBLICLY, MY CLIENT WILL LET YOU HAVE FREQUENT VISITATION WITH YOUR GRANDCHILD." Rizzo: THEY SIMPLY WANTED TO SEE MORE OF THEIR GRANDDAUGHTER. IT WAS AN ASTOUNDINGLY EFFECTIVE PR MOVE. THEY DECIDE TO TRY HER FIRST FOR PATRICIA'S HOMICIDE. THAT'S THE STRONGEST CASE THEY HAD. DR. CHARLES WHEELER, THE FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST, CONDUCTED A SECOND AUTOPSY. A POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION PLACES THE TIME OF DEATH APPROXIMATELY 6 P.M. Rizzo: THAT WAS ALSO THE TIME THAT SHARON SAYS SHE LAST SAW PATRICIA. THE DEFENSE'S APPROACH WAS TO ATTACK THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL NATURE OF THE CASE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LAST I CHECKED, IT WASN'T A CRIME TO GO FOR A RIDE IN A CAR. [ LAUGHTER ] Peebles: AND THEY ALSO HAMMERED THE TIMELINE. HOW COULD SHE DRIVE TO PHELPS ROAD, DO ALL OF THAT, AND CALL HER FATHER-IN-LAW IN JUST 1 HOUR? VERY RARELY IN A TRIAL DO YOU GET, LIKE, SOME SORT OF BLOCKBUSTER PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT SUDDENLY COMES OUT. BUT IN THIS CASE, IT HAPPENED. THE GUN THAT SHARON HAD PURCHASED HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY OWNED BY A MAN WHO WAS AN AIRLINE PILOT. Man: DO YOU POSSESS ANY BULLETS SHOT FROM THAT GUN? NO, SIR. BUT I DID SHOOT INTO A STUMP IN AN EMPTY LOT, UH, NEAR THE AIRPORT. [ INDISTINCT MUTTERING ] IF THEY COULD FIND A BULLET IN THAT WOOD THAT MATCHED THE BULLET THAT WAS FOUND WHERE PATRICIA WAS KILLED, THEN THEY HAD HER. Peebles: THE JUDGE RULED THAT BOTH SIDES, THE PROSECUTORS AND THE DEFENSE, CAN RUSH OUT TO THIS TREE STUMP. [ CHAINSAW WHIRRING ] Rizzo: THEY USE A CHAINSAW TO CUT IT INTO SECTIONS. THERE WERE SEVEN BULLETS IN THE PIECES OF WOOD. ONLY ONE OF THEM TURNED OUT TO BE A .22. Kilgariff: BUT THE CHAINSAW CUT THE BULLET IN HALF, MAKING IT INADMISSIBLE AS EVIDENCE IN COURT. Peebles: DUMB LUCK. [ LAUGHS ] WHAT CAN YOU SAY? THE JURY DELIBERATED FOR 1 HOUR AND 35 MINUTES. THE JURY FINDS THE DEFENDANT NOT GUILTY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] Peebles: THE COURTROOM ERUPTED IN CHEERS. Rizzo: IN 30 YEARS OF COVERING TRIALS, I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT. Peebles: IT MAKES BROWNING EVEN MORE DETERMINED TO CONVICT HER OF KILLING HER HUSBAND. BUT THEY NEEDED MORE EVIDENCE. [ MUSIC PLAYS ] YES, I WILL LET YOU DRIVE YEAR-ROUND IN YOUR THUNDERBIRD. THEY CONVINCED JOHN BOLDIZS TO DRIVE HER AROUND AND TRY TO GET HER TO CONFESS WHILE THAT CONVERSATION WAS BEING TAPE-RECORDED BY THE DETECTIVE IN THE TRUNK OF THE CAR. Sharon: IF THERE WERE ONLY TWO TYPES OF ICE CREAM ON THE PLANET EARTH, WHICH TWO TYPES OF ICE CREAM WOULD YOU CHOOSE? UH, PROBABLY JUST GO WITH CHOCOLATE AND VANILLA. OW! DAMN IT! YOU DOING ALL RIGHT? WITH JAMES, YOU NEVER REALLY TALKED. JOHN BOLDIZS IS FISHING, TRYING TO GET HER TO CONFESS. YOU KNOW, IF YOU EVER REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT, I CAN -- DID YOU KNOW THAT ELIZABETH TAYLOR SAYS THAT SHE MARRIED EDDIE FISHER JUST BECAUSE SHE WAS SO SAD OVER MIKE TODD DYING IN THAT PLANE CRASH? WHO'S MIKE TODD? MIKE TODD, HE MADE "AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS." OH, I SAW THAT PICTURE! AND HE NAMED HIS PLANE FOR HER. I WONDER IF ANYONE WILL NAME A PLANE AFTER ME SOMEDAY. I'D SETTLE FOR A BOAT. ASK HER THE QUESTION. SO... DO.. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU, UH, SAID YOU'D GIVE ME $1,000 IF I KILLED JAMES? YOU WERE JOKING, RIGHT? DID YOU MEAN IT? HAVE YOU SEEN "BUTTERFIELD 8?" OH, LIZ IS JUST THE CAT'S MEOW. HER NAME IS GLORIA. [ SIGHS ] IS SHE LUCKY? IS SHE BRILLIANT? Kilgariff: SHE'S SMART ENOUGH TO KEEP HER MOUTH SHUT. Habel: INVESTIGATORS WERE ABLE TO GET JOHN BOLDIZS TO SIGN A STATEMENT SAYING THAT, BEFORE JAMES KINNE WAS MURDERED, SHARON HAD OFFERED HIM $1,000 TO KILL HER HUSBAND. Peebles: BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT HE FLIPS ON THE STAND AND SAYS, "SHE SAID THAT, BUT SHE WAS JUST JOKING." THE PROSECUTOR IMMEDIATELY CROSS-EXAMINED HIM. AND THE LAW STATES THAT YOU CAN'T CROSS-EXAMINE YOUR OWN WITNESS JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED IN WHAT THEY SAY. Habel: DESPITE ALL OF THAT, IN THE END, SHARON KINNE IS FOUND GUILTY OF THE MURDER OF HER HUSBAND AND SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. NOW, PLEASE, PUT A PLANT IN HERE. IT'S DEPRESSING. SHE'S GIVEN LIFE IN PRISON. BUT SHE DOESN'T SPEND LIFE IN PRISON. Rizzo: AFTER SERVING ABOUT 18 MONTHS, BECAUSE OF JOHN BOLDIZS, THE APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS THE CONVICTION. Peebles: OVER THE NEXT 4 YEARS, THE SECOND TRIAL FOR THE MURDER OF JAMES KINNE ENDS IN A MISTRIAL. THE THIRD TRIAL -- HUNG JURY. SHE WAS OUT ON BOND THE WHOLE TIME, ENJOYING HER LIFE. THE FOURTH TRIAL IS SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER OF 1964. SERGEANT BROWNING HAS PERSONALLY TESTIFIED THREE TIMES AGAINST HER IN COURT. Kilgariff: SHARON WAS PRACTICALLY BROWNING'S WHITE WHALE. HE JUST COULDN'T LET IT GO. EVEN AFTER THE INVESTIGATION WAS CLOSED, HE STAYED ON HER TAIL. BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH BEING ONE STEP BEHIND SOMEONE. YOU CAN'T STOP THEM, EVEN IF THEY DECIDE TO KILL AGAIN. Jones: YOU SEEN THIS MORNING'S PAPER YET? Rizzo: ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 21ST, 1964... SHE'S IN MEXICO? ...THERE'S A GLARING HEADLINE SHARON KINNE HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN MEXICO FOR MURDER. Kilgariff: A MAN NAMED FRANCISCO ORDONEZ IS FOUND DEAD IN AN UPSCALE MOTEL IN MEXICO CITY WITH A BULLET IN HIS BACK. Peebles: HE IS A CHICAGO-BASED RADIO ANNOUNCER WHO IS ALSO A MEXICAN NATIONAL. Rizzo: SHE SAID HE TRIED TO RAPE HER, AND SHE WAS DEFENDING HERSELF, EVEN THOUGH THE GUY WAS SHOT IN THE BACK. Kilgariff: UNLESS HE WAS TRYING TO VIOLENTLY BACK INTO HER, HER STORY DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. [ FOREIGN ] A HOTEL EMPLOYEE RESPONDS. AND HE ENDS UP GETTING SHOT IN THE ARM. SHARON TELLS INVESTIGATORS IN MEXICO THAT SHE WAS JUST THERE ON VACATION. BUT WHEN THEY SEARCH HER ROOM... HE GAVE THAT TO ME. ...THEY FIND 300 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, A FAKE ID, AND A COUPLE GUNS. SHE'S REFERRED TO IN THE MEXICAN PRESS AS LA PISTOLERA, THE WOMAN GUNSLINGER. Peebles: THERE IS A 22-CALIBER PISTOL. COULD THAT BE THE MURDER WEAPON THAT THEY COULD NEVER FIND? THE MEXICAN POLICE FIRE THREE SHOTS OUT OF THAT GUN AND SHIP THE BULLETS TO KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI. AND IT'S TESTED. IT'S THE SAME GUN THAT KILLED PATRICIA JONES. TO THE POLICE, THAT WAS CONFIRMATION OF THE THEORY THAT SHARON WAS HER MURDERER. NO ONE ELSE WAS PRESENT WHEN PATRICIA JONES WAS MURDERED. BUT WE COULD IMAGINE THAT SHARON DROVE HER OUT TO THIS LOCATION... Rizzo: BASED ON THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, I CAN IMAGINE PATRICIA ON HER KNEES, PERHAPS BEGGING FOR HER LIFE. Peebles: SHARON MAY EVEN HAVE TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH WALTER'S CHILD. Rizzo: BROWNING BELIEVED THAT SHARON PULLS THE TRIGGER [ GUNSHOT ] AND PULLS THE TRIGGER [ GUNSHOT ] AND PULLS THE TRIGGER [ GUNSHOT ] AND, AS SHE'S LAYING ON THE GROUND, FIRES ONE MORE SHOT INTO HER ABDOMEN. [ GUNSHOT ] SHE STAGES THE SEXUAL ASSAULT CRIME SCENE, AND THEN GOES TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY. BECAUSE OF THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAUSE IN THE CONSTITUTION, SHE COULDN'T BE RETRIED FOR THAT CRIME. BUT MEXICAN AUTHORITIES PROSECUTED... Peebles: THEY HAVE A TRIAL. AND SHE GETS 13 YEARS AT A PRISON IN MEXICO. Woman: AFTER 5 YEARS, AT LEAST THAT LUNATIC WAS BEHIND BARS SOMEWHERE. IT MAKES ME ANGRY STILL. IF SHARON MURDERED PAT, IT WAS OVER SO LITTLE, JEALOUSY OR SPITE AT WALT, A MAN SHE BARELY KNEW. AND IF SHE MURDERED JAMES, IT WAS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T DELIVER HER FROM INDEPENDENCE TO THE LIFE OF HER DREAMS. COULD SHE REALLY HAVE JUST WANTED TO TRADE HIM IN FOR A NEW MODEL? Kilgariff: SHE WAS LIKE AN ARROW GOING THROUGH THE WORLD. GOOD-BYE. Rizzo: I FEEL LIKE SHE MIGHT'VE BEEN THINKING, "I WANT WHAT I WANT. IF ANYONE'S IN MY WAY, I'M GONNA TAKE 'EM OUT." Peebles: IF SHARON WERE INVOLVED IN THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND, THEN SHE'S WILLING TO IMPLICATE HER OWN CHILD TO GET AWAY WITH IT. AT LEAST THEY KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOW WHERE SHE NEEDED TO BE. Announcer: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SUNDAY BASEBALL GAME, FOLKS. GIBSON DEALS TO MCCARVER FROM THE STRETCH. STRIKE THREE. FASTBALL ON THE INSIDE CORNER. THAT WAS A HOT ONE.
