 [ BIRD SQUAWKING ] Woman: NOTHING MUCH EVER HAPPENED IN LINCOLN. BUT NO ONE AROUND HERE SEEMED TO MIND. THERE'S A SPECIAL SORT OF QUIET YOU JUST CAN'T FIND ANYWHERE ELSE BUT THE FIELDS RIGHT OUTSIDE OF TOWN. OR, AT LEAST, THERE WAS. I DON'T GO OUT THERE MUCH ANYMORE, NOT SINCE THAT NIGHT. Dispatcher: Unit 5? We just got a frantic phone call

 about a man laying down out in Superior Street. Please go check it out. FOLKS MIGHT NOT HAVE HEARD OF LINCOLN BEFORE THAT NIGHT. BUT AFTERWARDS, NO ONE COULD FORGET IT. YOU SEE, THAT WAS THE NIGHT THE HEARTLAND TURNED BAD. MY DAD, SHERIFF MERLE KARNOPP, GOT CALLED OUT TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF LINCOLN, WHERE THEY HAD FOUND THE BODY. Gay: JUST OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, THERE WAS A YOUNG WHITE MALE WHO'D BEEN SHOT SEVERAL TIMES. THEY FIND A WALLET IN THE BACK POCKET. THE WALLET INDICATES THAT IT'S ROBERT COLVERT,

 AN EMPLOYEE AT THE CREST SERVICE STATION. Officer: ACCORDING TO THE STATION MANAGER, ABOUT $160 STOLEN. THIS INCLUDES ABOUT $10 IN LOOSE CHANGE. Gay: THEIR IMMEDIATE SUSPICION IS THAT SOMEBODY HAS COME THROUGH LINCOLN, PERHAPS ON THEIR WAY WEST TO DENVER, AND MURDERED COLVERT FOR THE MONEY IN THE GAS STATION. BUT THE CREST GAS STATION IS BACK IN LINCOLN. WELL, WHAT'S HE DOING ALL THE WAY OUT HERE? WHERE'S STALANDZ? Dennis: THE PERSON WHO DISCOVERED THE BODY AND CALLED IT IN, WILBUR STALANDZ, WAS KIND OF A SELF-STYLED PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR THAT WOULD CHECK ON PLACES TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE LOCKED UP AT NIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE, STALANDZ? I WAS JUST DOING MY NIGHTLY ROUNDS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE, DOING YOUR ROUNDS WITH A AIRMAN FROM THE BASE? O'Donnell: STALANDZ WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A 21-YEAR-OLD AIRMAN FROM THE LOCAL AIR BASE. THAT'S MY BUSINESS AS A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR TO KEEP MY DOINGS PRIVATE. Dennis: FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, STALANDZ DIDN'T HAVE A REAL GOOD REPUTATION. O'Donnell: HE WAS A LITTLE BIT SHADY. Dennis: DID HE HAVE MORE TO DO WITH THIS THAN HE'S TELLING US NOW? THEY DECIDE TO TAKE THEM IN FOR FURTHER QUESTIONING. WHAT WERE YOU DOING ON THAT ROAD? I WAS JUST THERE TO HELP, SIR. DOING WHAT? THIS GENTLEMAN WAS WORKING WITH ME. THEY WEREN'T TELLING A STORY THAT MADE SENSE. ONE THING'S FOR SURE -- WIND UP ON A DARK ROAD WITH A DEAD BODY AND NO GOOD STORY, AND YOU CAN BET SOME QUESTIONS ARE GONNA COME YOUR WAY. Dennis: I THINK THIS AIRMAN WAS NERVOUS. THE POLICE DECIDED TO GIVE HIM A LIE DETECTOR TEST. AND HE EVEN FAILS THAT. Dennis: FINALLY, THE AIRMAN DID DISCLOSE WHAT THEY WERE DOING. LISTEN, I WASN'T THERE, AND NEITHER WERE YOU. ALL I KNOW IS, SHERIFF KARNOPP BELIEVED IT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ROBERT COLVERT'S DEAD BODY. Dennis: WHATEVER IT WAS, IT WAS ENOUGH THAT THEY ULTIMATELY DETERMINED THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. UH, MRS. COLVERT, THANK YOU FOR -- FOR COMING IN TODAY. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ROBERT. THANK YOU. WHEN'S THE BABY DUE? JUST A FEW WEEKS. MRS. COLVERT, DO YOU KNOW ANYONE THAT MIGHT HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST YOUR HUSBAND? NO! NOBODY! THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I REALIZED THAT WHEN YOU SAY, "TILL DEATH DO US PART," YOU DON'T GET TO CHOOSE WHEN. SHE WASN'T MORE THAN A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS. SHE WAS ALL ALONE, WITH A BABY ON THE WAY. AND THE LONGER THE POLICE LOOKED AT HIS DEATH, THE MORE MEANINGLESS IT SEEMED. HE WAS MURDERED FOR BARELY MORE THAN POCKET CHANGE. I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME. I'M SORRY. Dennis: IT'S ALMOST A MONTH-OLD CASE. AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY SUSPECTS. MY DAD, PARTICULARLY, DOESN'T LIKE THAT AT ALL. AT THIS POINT, INVESTIGATORS WANT TIPS FROM THE PUBLIC. I REMEMBER MY MOM SAID THAT IF THE POLICE WERE ASKING FOR OUR HELP, THAT WAS A SURE SIGN THEY WEREN'T EVER GONNA FIND THE GUY. BUT MAYBE THAT'S WHY MY MAMA WASN'T A POLICEMAN. MRS. KEMP. SHERIFF KARNOPP. THIS IS DETECTIVE JAMES. NICE TO MEET YOU. MRS. KEMP IS A WOMAN WHO OWNS A USED-CLOTHING STORE IN NORTH LINCOLN. WE UNDERSTAND, UH, YOU HAD A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER IN HERE. YES. HE PAID ME WITH ROLLED COINS. INVESTIGATORS KNOW THAT $10 WORTH OF COINS WAS TAKEN FROM THE CREST FILLING STATION DURING THE ROBBERY. COULD YOU DESCRIBE WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE? SHE SAYS THE DAY AFTER THE COLVERT MURDER, A YOUNG MAN CAME INTO THE STORE. HE PURCHASED $10 WORTH OF CLOTHES AND PAID IN COINS. HE WAS A SHORT CAUCASIAN TEENAGER. AROUND HERE, KIDS WERE STILL JUST KIDS. SO WHEN MRS. KEMP SAID IT WAS A TEENAGER, SHERIFF KARNOPP MUST HAVE DONE A DOUBLE-TAKE. HIS SON DENNY WAS THE STRAIGHTEST ARROW AROUND. YOU THINK YOU'D RECOGNIZE HIM IF YOU SAW HIM AGAIN? - MAYBE. - OKAY. IF THIS INDIVIDUAL COMES IN AGAIN, YOU -- YOU GIVE US A CALL, OKAY? BUT THERE WASN'T TIME FOR THAT. THE BLOOD KEPT COMING. HOPING THAT ROBERT COLVERT'S MURDER WAS A ONE-OFF WAS JUST WISHFUL THINKING. Gay: 27th OF JANUARY, 1958. TWO MEN PARK IN FRONT OF 924 BELMONT AVENUE. COME ON. THEY GO IN THE BACKYARD AND NOTICE A SMELL. THEY OPEN THE DOOR TO THE PRIVY AND FIND THE BODY OF A LITTLE GIRL. Gay: ON MONDAY AFTERNOON, 27th OF JANUARY, 1958, INVESTIGATORS ARE CALLED TO 924 BELMONT AVENUE. THEY IDENTIFY THE BODY OF A SMALL CHILD, ABOUT 2 OR 3 YEARS OLD, AND OF A WOMAN WHO'S BEEN WRAPPED AND STUFFED IN ONE OF THE TOILETS. THEY LOOK IN THE CHICKEN COOP AND FIND THE WRAPPED BODY OF A MAN. INVESTIGATORS KNOW THAT THIS IS THE RESIDENCE OF MARION AND VELDA BARTLETT. THEY IDENTIFY THE CORPSES AS THE TWO OF THEM, AND THE CHILD AS BEING THEIR DAUGHTER, BETTY JEAN. THE FATHER, MARION BARTLETT, HAS BEEN SHOT WITH A .22 LONG RIFLE AND STABBED IN THE THROAT. THE MOTHER HAS BEEN SHOT AND BLUDGEONED. AND THE LITTLE GIRL HAS BEEN KILLED BY BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO THE HEAD, PROBABLY THE BUTT OF A GUN, BUT HAS ALSO BEEN STABBED IN THE THROAT. IT'S JUST SHOCKING, ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING. Gay: THE MEDICAL EXAMINER CONCLUDES THAT THEY'VE BEEN DEAD FOR AT LEAST 2 DAYS. Man: SHERIFF! THERE'S ANOTHER DAUGHTER BY A PREVIOUS MARRIAGE, CARIL ANN. AND SHE'S NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. Woman: GOSH, CARIL ANN. SHE WAS MY YEAR IN SCHOOL. BUT CARIL ANN WASN'T PART OF OUR REGULAR GROUP. SHE'D NEVER TALK MUCH. I THOUGHT MAYBE SHE WAS JUST ONE OF THEM WHO WAS ALWAYS IN HER OWN WORLD. MY BROTHER SAID HE BET SHE WAS DEAD LIKE THE REST OF THEM. BUT I HAD A DIFFERENT FEELING ABOUT IT. SOMETHING TOLD ME SHE WAS ALIVE. STILL, I KNEW IT COULDN'T BE GOOD. BECAUSE EVEN IF SHE WASN'T DEAD YET, SHE COULD BE REAL SOON. Gay: THE TWO FELLOWS THAT FOUND THE BODIES ARE BOB VON BUSCH AND RODNEY STARKWEATHER. DO YOU KNOW CARIL ANN FUGATE? SHE'S DATING MY BROTHER, CHARLIE. DO YOU KNOW WHERE CARIL ANN COULD BE? RODNEY IS THE BROTHER OF CHARLIE STARKWEATHER, WHO HAS BEEN DATING CARIL ANN FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF. WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SAW YOUR BROTHER CHARLIE? MORE THAN A WEEK AGO. Gay: CHARLIE HAS HAD A TOUGH CHILDHOOD. HE'S FROM THE PART OF TOWN YOU END UP IN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. HE'S BEEN PICKED ON CONSTANTLY IN SCHOOL. O'Donnell: HE WAS WORKING AS A GARBAGE MAN, MAKING, YOU KNOW, NOT VERY MUCH. CHARLIE'S MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT HE'S ANGRY AT THE WORLD. Dennis: I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH AND KNEW CHARLIE STARKWEATHER. HE WAS DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH. PEOPLE WERE AFRAID OF HIM, YOU KNOW? CHARLIE STARKWEATHER WASN'T LIKE MOST OF THE OLDER BOYS IN TOWN. HE WAS OUR VERY OWN "REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE." AFTER THAT MOVIE CAME OUT, HE FOUND HIMSELF A LEATHER JACKET AND STARTING SWAGGERING AROUND TOWN, JUST LIKE HE THOUGHT JAMES DEAN WOULD, PICKING FIGHTS WITH ANYONE THAT LOOKED AT HIM WRONG. I DON'T KNOW. HE SEEMED LIKE A REAL PHONY TO ME. BUT MY GRANNY ALWAYS SAID, "THERE'S NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTE." CARIL ANN THOUGHT HE WAS THE BEE'S KNEES. Gay: CHARLIE IS 19. AND CARIL ANN IS 14. RODNEY SAYS THAT AGE DIFFERENCE IS VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR HER PARENTS. MARION AND VELDA HAD TOLD CARIL THAT SHE NEEDED TO END THE RELATIONSHIP. ALL RIGHT. WHEN'S THE LAST TIME EACH OF YOU SAW OR SPOKE TO CARIL? WE WERE HERE LAST WEEK, BUT SHE WOULDN'T LET US IN. THE POLICE LEARN THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST WEEK, PEOPLE HAVE COME TO SEE THE BARTLETTS. EVEN CARIL ANN'S GRANDMOTHER CAME BY. Caril Ann: GRANDMA, EVERYONE'S REAL SICK RIGHT NOW. Grandmother: WHAT'S WRONG? Gay: CARIL ANN TURNED PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE DOOR. WE FINALLY DECIDED ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH AND CAME OVER AGAIN. YOU THINK YOUR BROTHER MIGHT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS? Gay: THIS IS SHOCKING FOR THE POLICE. THEY'RE SEEING A BROTHER ESSENTIALLY ADMIT THAT HIS BROTHER COULD BE INVOLVED IN A TRIPLE MURDER. Dennis: AT THAT POINT IN TIME, MY FATHER, HE HAD TO WONDER ABOUT THE COLVERT CASE AS WELL. Gay: NO ONE HAS SEEN CHARLIE OR CARIL ANN FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. THAT NATURALLY RAISES THE QUESTION -- WHERE ARE THEY? IS CARIL ANN POSSIBLY HIS HOSTAGE? HE BORROWED MY RIFLE LAST WEEK. WHAT KIND? LONG RIFLE, A .22. Dennis: .22 RIFLE HAD BEEN USED FOR THE KILLINGS OF MARION AND VELDA BARTLETT. IN ADDITION, MARION'S SHOTGUN APPEARS TO BE MISSING. THIS IS AN ALL-POINTS BULLETIN. CHARLES R. STARKWEATHER. Gay: THE POLICE SWING INTO ACTION, PUT OUT AN APB FOR CHARLIE'S CAR. AND THEY SAY THAT CHARLIE IS ARMED AND DANGEROUS. EVERYBODY JUST HITS THE DECK PRETTY MUCH RUNNING. AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, CHARLIE'S CAR WAS SPOTTED THE NEXT MORNING 20 MILES OUTSIDE OF LINCOLN, STUCK IN THE MUD NEAR OLD AUGUST MEYER'S FARM. O'Donnell: THEY SURROUND A FARMHOUSE. CHARLES STARKWEATHER! WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! COME ON OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP! [ GLASS SHATTERS ] Woman: ALL THOSE MEN WITH GUNS AND TEAR GAS... OUR QUIET FARMLAND WAS STARTING TO FEEL MORE LIKE A WAR ZONE. AND EVEN AFTER ALL THAT, HE SLIPPED RIGHT THROUGH THEIR FINGERS. Dennis: THERE'S NO CHARLIE STARKWEATHER. THERE'S NO CARIL ANN FUGATE. THERE'S NO AUGUST MEYER. THERE'S NOBODY. Man: I SEE SOMETHING OVER HERE! NOT EVERYONE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MISS HIM. Dennis: THE FARMER, AUGUST MEYER, HAD BEEN SHOT BY A .410-GAUGE SHOTGUN. Gay: THE BODY'S BEEN COVERED. EXCUSE ME, SHERIFF. WE'VE GOT TWO TEENS IN BENNET THAT HAVE GONE MISSING, ALONG WITH THEIR CAR. SHERIFF KARNOPP WAS ALERTED TO THE FACT THAT CAROL KING AND BOB JENSEN WENT OUT ON A DATE AND HAVEN'T COME BACK. THE LOCALS ARE LOOKING FOR CAROL KING AND BOB JENSEN. THEY'RE BOTH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AT BENNET, NEBRASKA. THERE WAS A UNDERGROUND STORAGE FACILITY NEAR THE MEYER FARM. THEY FOUND THE BODIES OF THESE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE. O'Donnell: THERE'S BLOOD EVERYWHERE. Gay: THEY HAD BEEN SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES. O'Donnell: THE MURDERS OF BOB JENSEN AND CAROL KING ARE DIFFERENT. Gay: CAROL HAD BEEN SEXUALLY MUTILATED WITH A KNIFE. THE POLICE THINK CHARLIE TOOK THE JENSEN CAR. BUT WHERE ARE THEY GOING? HE HAS HAD 20 HOURS TO ESCAPE AFTER THE LAST KILLING. HE COULD BE 1,000 MILES AWAY. POLICE SET UP CHECKPOINTS ALL OVER THE STATE. HOWEVER, ANOTHER NIGHT PASSES AND NO ONE SPOTS BOB JENSEN'S CAR. THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN WAITING BY THE PHONE. WE ASSUMED CHARLIE WAS MAKING A BEELINE FOR THE BORDER. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] KARNOPP. BOY, WERE WE WRONG. THREE MORE BODIES HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN A PROMINENT NEIGHBORHOOD, RIGHT IN LINCOLN ITSELF. THE VICTIMS ARE C. LAUER WARD, A PROMINENT INDUSTRIALIST AND HIS WIFE, CLARA, AND THEIR MAID, LILLIAN FENCL. LAUER AND CLARA WARD ARE MY GRANDPARENTS. MY FATHER WAS FAR AWAY AT BOARDING SCHOOL. LAUER WARD IS LYING IN THE DOORWAY, SHOT IN THE BACK. CLARA WARD IS UPSTAIRS IN HER NIGHTGOWN, TIED UP. SHE IS DEAD FROM MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS TO THE HEAD AND CHEST. LILLIAN FENCL WAS ALSO TIED UP AND STABBED. ANY SIGNS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT? DOESN'T SEEM TO BE. NOTHING MUCH HAS BEEN STOLEN. HOWEVER, IN PLACE OF THE WARD'S PACKARD IS BOB JENSEN'S CAR. O'Donnell: BOTH MRS. WARD AND THE HOUSEKEEPER WERE TIED UP. THAT SEEMS LIKE A FAIRLY HARD THING TO DO WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP YOUR EYES ON ONE AND TIE UP THE OTHER. I GUESS CHARLIE'S HOLDING THE GUN ON CARIL WHILE SHE TIES 'EM UP. POSSIBLE. UNLESS CHARLIE'S TYING 'EM UP AND CARIL'S HOLDING THE GUN. IT COULD BE THAT WAY, TOO. AT 14, WE WERE STILL GIGGLING ABOUT THE IDEA OF PARKING AND PETTING. AND ALL ALONG, CARIL ANN NEVER LET ON THAT SHE AND CHARLIE HAD GONE ALL THE WAY. STILL WATERS, YOU KNOW? Johnston: CHARLIE AND CARIL HAD A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP. THIS 19-YEAR-OLD DATING THIS 14-YEAR-OLD, SEEMS LIKE THERE WOULD BE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN POWER AND INFLUENCE. THERE WASN'T ANY OTHER EXPLANATION. MAYBE CARIL ANN WAS A LITTLE LOOSE, BUT SHE WASN'T STUPID. EVEN AT 14, WE ALL KNEW NO BOY WAS WORTH ALL THAT. I COULDN'T MAKE SENSE OF IT ANY WHICH WAY. CARIL ANN ALWAYS MARCHED TO THE BEAT OF HER OWN DRUM. AND THE CHARLIE I KNEW DIDN'T SEEM LIKE HE COULD CONVINCE ANYONE TO DO MUCH OF ANYTHING. Johnston: CHARLIE WAS VERY IMMATURE. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HIM IMPRESSING A GIRL HIS OWN AGE. WHICH LEADS THE POLICE TO WONDER -- IS CARIL ANN A HOSTAGE OR A WILLING ACCOMPLICE? Man on radio: THE BODIES OF C. LAUER WARD, 47, PRESIDENT OF CAPITAL STEEL COMPANY, HIS WIFE, CLARA WARD, 46, AND FAMILY MAID LILLIAN FENCL, 51, WERE DISCOVERED THIS MORNING IN THE WARDS' HOME IN SOUTH LINCOLN. THIS MARKS THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE DAY THAT MULTIPLE MURDER VICTIMS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN EITHER LINCOLN OR THE BENNET AREA. LINCOLN POLICE ARE ENGAGED IN A STREET-BY-STREET SEARCH FOR PRIMARY SUSPECT CHARLES STARKWEATHER. BY NOW, THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE RADIO ARE ALL OVER THIS STORY. Dennis: MY FATHER WAS UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE. Gay: THE CITY OF LINCOLN, AND INDEED THE ENTIRE STATE OF NEBRASKA, IS IN FULL-BLOWN PANIC. PARENTS ARE HIDING THEIR KIDS UNDER BEDS. SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN CLOSED. THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS BEEN CALLED OUT. IT PUT THE WHOLE STATE ON ITS EAR. HE IS TO BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Ward: ANYBODY MIGHT BE HIS NEXT VICTIM. Woman: WE HAD NO IDEA WHERE CHARLIE WAS, OR WHEN HE WOULD STRIKE AGAIN. BEING AFRAID OF SOMEONE YOU KNOW IS A SPECIAL KIND OF FEAR. I'LL NEVER FORGET THE DAYS I SPENT AT HOME, WAITING TO HEAR THAT CHARLIE HAD BEEN CAUGHT, JUST PRAYING ME AND MY FAMILY WOULD MAKE IT THROUGH ALIVE. Woman: SEE, TO US, CHARLIE WASN'T JUST A KILLER. HE USED TO GO TO OUR SAME HIGH SCHOOL. HE WAS DATING A GIRL IN MY CLASS. HELL, HE EVEN PICKED UP OUR OLD GARBAGE FOR A WHILE. AND FOR SHERIFF KARNOPP... CHARLIE HAD BEEN FRIENDS WITH HIS SON WHEN THEY WERE JUST LITTLE. AIN'T THAT A KICK IN THE HEAD? IT WAS THE STRANGEST THING, KNOWING THAT THE BOY WE'D SEEN CRUISING AROUND TOWN JUST LAST MONTH WAS DRIVING AROUND KILLING PEOPLE NOW. AND HE HAD CARIL ANN WITH HIM! NO ONE KNEW IF SHE WAS IN DANGER OR IF HE JUST LIKED KEEPING HIS GIRL CLOSE. IT'S HARD TO KNOW A PERSON. IT'S HARDER STILL TO UNDERSTAND THEM OR IMAGINE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR HEAD. WAS THERE A RHYME OR A REASON TO CHARLIE'S MADNESS? IF NOT, HOW EXACTLY WAS ANYONE GONNA STOP HIM? OR FORGET ABOUT STOPPING HIM. HOW WAS ANYONE GONNA FIND HIM? Gay: THE AFTERNOON OF WEDNESDAY, THE 29th, WILLIAM ROMER, WHO'S A DEPUTY SHERIFF IN WYOMING, IS DRIVING ALONG HIGHWAY 87. ROMER SEES A STRUGGLE AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. TWO MEN ARE FIGHTING OVER WHAT APPEARS TO BE A GUN. AND IN ONE OF THE CARS, A MAN IS SLUMPED DEAD IN THE FRONT SEAT. Caril Ann: IT'S CHARLES STARKWEATHER! AND I SAW HIM KILL 10 PEOPLE! HE KIDNAPPED ME! BE ADVISED, CHARLES STARKWEATHER! HE'S GOING SOUTH ON 87! Gay: CARIL ANN SAYS, "STOP! STOP! THAT'S CHARLIE STARKWEATHER! AND HE'S KIDNAPPED ME! I SAW HIM MURDER 10 PEOPLE!" FEEL LIKE IT GONNA RAIN, HUH? YEP. MY KNEES TELL ME IT'S GONNA RAIN. I GIVE IT ABOUT AN HOUR. [ DISPATCHER SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] We got a report that says Charlie Starkweather from Nebraska is heading your direction on 87. - THAT'S OUR GUY. - THAT'S OUR GUY. LET'S GO. Gay: THE LOCAL SHERIFF JOINS THE CHASE. THEY START SHOOTING AT THE CAR. [ GUNSHOT ] ONE OF THE BULLETS GOES THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW AND SHATTERS THE SAFETY GLASS. CHARLES STARKWEATHER! GET OUT OF THE CAR AND GET ON THE GROUND! NOW! NOW! HE LIES DOWN ON THE GROUND. THEY CAPTURE HIM. AND HE SAYS, "YOU SHOT ME! I'M BLEEDING!" AND ONE OF THE SHERIFFS LATER SAID, "THAT'S WHAT A YELLOW SON OF A BITCH HE WAS." DON'T BLAME CARIL. SHE DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. Woman: FOR A GUY WHO KILLED SO MANY PEOPLE, CHARLIE SURE WAS CALM. HE DIDN'T SEEM LIKE HE HAD A CARE IN THE WORLD. Dennis: SOMEONE HAS TO GO BRING CHARLIE BACK TO LINCOLN. HE HAD SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED THAT SHERIFF KARNOPP BE, UH, THE ONE WHO DID THIS. - CHARLIE? - HI, SHERIFF! HOW'S DENNY? DENNY'S ME. MEANTIME, SOMEBODY HAD TO GO GET CARIL. AND THAT FELL TO MY MOTHER. CARIL, I'M GOING TO BE ESCORTING YOU BACK TO LINCOLN. ONCE CARIL ANN WAS SAFE, WE THOUGHT WE'D FINALLY FIND OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. ARE MY FOLKS DEAD? D-- DON'T YOU KNOW? COULD CARIL ANN REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CHARLIE HAD BEEN DOING THIS WHOLE TIME? OR DID SHE ACTUALLY KNOW MORE THAN SHE WAS LETTING ON? THE CARIL ANN I KNEW SURE KNEW HOW TO KEEP A SECRET. Merle: WE FOUND THESE AT THE BARTLETT HOME. DECEMBER 1, 1957. CREST SERVICE STATION. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. I NEEDED MONEY TO PAY MY RENT. SO I EASED UP TO THAT GAS STATION AND PUT ON A BANDANNA RIGHT BELOW THE EYES. O'Donnell: AND HE GOT MR. COLVERT INTO THE VEHICLE AT GUNPOINT. HE KNEW WHAT I WAS THERE FOR. PUT UP A HELL OF A FIGHT, TOO. BUT ONCE I PUT A SHELL IN HIS HEAD, HE DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH FIGHT LEFT IN HIM. WHY HE DIDN'T JUST SHOOT AND KILL HIM AT THE STATION, WE DON'T KNOW. OKAY, CHARLIE. THE BARTLETT HOME. I WAS TRYING TO TELL 'EM THAT I LOVED CARIL. THEY DIDN'T WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH ME. AND BESIDES, I WAS TOO OLD FOR HER. THERE WAS BAD BLOOD BETWEEN CHARLIE AND MARION AND VELDA BARTLETT. THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT HE WOULD GET CARIL ANN PREGNANT. WAIT JUST A MINUTE. CHARLIE HAD BORROWED HIS BROTHER RODNEY'S .22-CALIBER RIFLE. I WANT YOU TO GET OUT OF HERE, NOW! WHY ARE YOU SAYING ALL THIS? AND THEN THEY JUST CAME AT ME. - YOU'RE NO GOOD! - WE LOVE EACH OTHER! AND WE'RE GONNA BE TOGETHER! - JUST GO! GO, NOW! PLEASE! YOU'RE NO GOOD FOR HER! THEY WOULDN'T QUIT. O'Donnell: CHARLIE SHOT HIM WITH THE RIFLE AND KILLED HIM. VELDA CAME AT CHARLIE THEN WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE. AND CHARLIE SHOT HER. I HAD -- I HAD TO TAKE A STAND. I COULDN'T LET 'EM KEEP PUSHING ON ME. WHAT ABOUT THE BABY, CHARLIE? WHY'D YOU KILL HER? [ BABY CRYING ] SHE WOULDN'T STOP CRYING. SHUT UP. SHUT UP! [ CRYING CONTINUES ] WHERE WAS CARIL DURING ALL THIS? SHE WAS AT SCHOOL. O'Donnell: HE SAID THAT CARIL HAD COME HOME AFTERWARD. HE CLAIMED THAT HE HAD TOLD HER HE HAD TAKEN HER FAMILY HOSTAGE AND KEPT THEM IN A GARAGE ON WOODSDALE AVENUE. AND THAT THEY WOULD BE OKAY AS LONG AS SHE SAID NOTHING. GRANDMA, GO AWAY. O'Donnell: BUT IF SHE DIDN'T DO THAT, HE WOULD KILL THE FAMILY. I KNEW IT WAS TIME TO GO. THEY TAKE OFF IN THE CAR TO THE MEYER FARM. WE GOT STUCK IN THE MUD OVER AT AUGUST MEYER'S FARM. AUGUST MEYER LIVED ALONE. AND CHARLIE HAD GOTTEN PERMISSION TO HUNT THERE IN THE PAST. O'Donnell: CHARLIE SAID AUGUST HAD A GUN IN HIS HAND. AND CHARLIE THOUGHT MAYBE AUGUST HAD HEARD A RADIO REPORT. SO CHARLIE SHOT AND KILLED HIM. Detective: HOW DID YOU KILL THE TEENAGERS? WHAT HAPPENED WITH 'EM? O'Donnell: THEY SAW HEADLIGHTS. BOB JENSEN, CAROL KING. WELL, WE THREW A STORY AT THAT GUY THAT WE NEEDED A RIDE TO BENNET. SO HE LET US IN HIS CAR. HE WASN'T TOO CALM WHEN I PUT THAT GUN AGAINST THE BACK OF HIS HEAD. AND WHAT'D YOU DO THEN? WHEN I SAW THAT CELLAR, I HAD HIM PULL OVER. [ CAROL SCREAMING ] SHE WAS STABBED, TOO, CHARLIE, BETWEEN HER LEGS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHY'D YOU DOUBLE BACK TO LINCOLN? WELL, UH, UH, BOB'S CAR HAD THOSE WHITEWALL TIRES. BUT IT DIDN'T RUN SO GOOD. Ward: THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO FIND A GOOD GETAWAY CAR. CHARLIE WAS A GARBAGE COLLECTOR IN THIS NICER NEIGHBORHOOD IN LINCOLN WHERE MY GRANDPARENTS LIVED. THAT'S WHY HE DECIDED TO GO BACK THERE. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? I HAD THOSE WOMEN MAKE ME BREAKFAST. CHARLIE ASKS MY GRANDMOTHER TO MAKE HIM PANCAKES AND THEN CHANGES HIS ORDER TO WAFFLES. I TAKE THOSE LADIES UPSTAIRS, TIED 'EM UP AND WAITED FOR THE HUSBAND TO COME HOME. AROUND 6:00, MY GRANDFATHER CAME IN THROUGH THE KITCHEN DOOR. I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING WAS GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. BUT HE TRIED TO RUN, SO I SHOT HIM IN THE BACK. BUT YOU STABBED THOSE LADIES. WHY? AIN'T THEY ALIVE? Gay: CHARLIE SEEMS TO EXPRESS GENUINE SURPRISE THAT BOTH WOMEN WERE DEAD. IN THE END, CHARLIE SAID HE KILLED 11 PEOPLE. O'Donnell: THE LAST ONE BEING THE SHOE SALESMAN, MERLE COLLISON, WHO WAS KILLED ON THE ROAD IN WYOMING BECAUSE CHARLIE WANTED TO TRADE CARS WITH HIM, AND HE REFUSED. BUT IF WE WERE HOPING TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE DID IT, WE WERE LEFT SCRATCHING OUR HEADS. WHY'D YOU DO IT, SON? I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE AN OUTLAW. JUST NOT THIS BIG OF ONE. ULTIMATELY, HE'S CONVICTED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH. CARIL ANN'S DEMEANOR MADE HER VERY UNPOPULAR IN THE PUBLIC PRESS. THE MORE WE LEARNED, THE LESS WE UNDERSTOOD. I THOUGHT FOR CERTAIN CARIL ANN WAS JUST CAUGHT UP IN SOMEONE ELSE'S MESS. THAT'S NOT WHAT THE STATE THOUGHT. THEY CHARGED HER WITH FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. Gay: THE PROSECUTORS FELT THAT CARIL ANN HAD TO BE LEGALLY COMPLICIT. SHE HAD MANY CHANCES TO ESCAPE AND DIDN'T. THEY FELT THEY REALLY HAD NO CHOICE OTHER THAN TO TRY HER AS AN ADULT. AFTER CHARLIE WAS CONVICTED, HE BECAME A BORN-AGAIN CHRISTIAN. AND HE WAS A PARTICIPANT IN CARIL ANN'S TRIAL. CARIL ANN FUGATE MAINTAINED THAT SHE WAS BEING HELD HOSTAGE. RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND. DO YOU SOLEMNLY SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, SO HELP YOU GOD? - I DO. Gay: THE D.A. CONVINCED CHARLIE TO TESTIFY AT HER TRIAL. AND HIS STORY CHANGED CONSIDERABLY. I'M HERE TO SAY THAT CARIL ANN WAS NO INNOCENT HOSTAGE. ON THE STAND AT CARIL ANN'S TRIAL, HE NOW CLAIMED THAT SHE WAS FULLY COMPLICIT IN ALL OF THE MURDERS, AT LEAST AS AN ACCESSORY, INCLUDING HER FAMILY. CHARLIE SAID THAT AS HE WAS CLEANING THINGS UP... ...SHE WAS WATCHING TELEVISION. CHARLIE SAID HE DIDN'T FORCE CARIL ANN TO DO A DAMN THING. GRANDMA, GO AWAY. SHE LIED BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO. CARIL ANN WAS CALLING ME A DIRTY BASTARD AND ACCUSING ME OF DOING SEXUAL STUFF WITH CAROL KING. FROM WHAT CHARLIE SAID, THAT GIRL HAD MORE THAN A TEMPER ON HER. O'Donnell: CHARLIE SAYS SHE HAD THE KNIFE. SHE WENT BACK DOWN INTO THAT CELLAR. AND SHE STABBED THE BODY OF CAROL KING IN THE GENITALS. Ward: ALL ALONG THE HIGHWAY AND BACK TO THE WARD HOUSE, CHARLIE SAID CARIL ANN WAS WREAKING HAVOC AND HAVING THE TIME OF HER LIFE. I TIED UP THEM WOMEN AND LEFT 'EM UP THERE WITHOUT A SCRATCH. SHE SAID MAYBE SHE WANTED TO GO UPSTAIRS AND MAKE SURE THE MAID DIDN'T TRY TO RUN AWAY. CHARLIE SAID SHE WAS JEALOUS, THINKING THAT HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED MY GRANDMOTHER. AND SHE PROCEEDED TO STAB THEM TO DEATH. FROM WHAT HE SAID, IT SOUNDED LIKE CHARLIE AND CARIL ANN WERE MADE OF THE SAME STUFF. O'Donnell: HOWEVER, HOW RELIABLE CHARLIE IS, IS DIFFICULT TO SAY. HIS STORY CHANGES FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT. WILLIAM ROMER, THE DEPUTY SHERIFF FROM WYOMING, HE THOUGHT THE SAME THING. I WAS MAKING MY REGULAR ROUNDS WHEN I ENCOUNTERED THE SUSPECT, MISS CARIL ANN FUGATE, WHO APPROACHED MY VEHICLE. MISS FUGATE SAID THAT SHE SAW HIM KILL 10 PEOPLE. MEANING THAT SHE HAD SEEN CHARLIE KILL HER PARENTS AND HER BABY SISTER. IF CARIL ANN REALLY WAS CHARLIE'S HOSTAGE, WOULDN'T SHE HAVE BEEN AFRAID, ANGRY, SAD? BUT THEY SAID HER FACE WAS LIKE STONE. CARIL ANN FUGATE WAS SULLEN, UNCOOPERATIVE, DIFFICULT. Gay: SHE'S A TOUGH CUSTOMER. Ward: THE OUTCOME OF CARIL ANN'S TRIAL IS THAT SHE IS CONVICTED OF THE FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. SHE IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. Gay: WAS CARIL ANN FUGATE A HOSTAGE OR A WILLING ACCOMPLICE? Dennis: MY MOTHER SAID THERE WERE JUST TOO MANY THINGS THAT CARIL KNEW THAT SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE KNOWN IF SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN INVOLVED. WE COULDN'T GET OVER IT. WHO WAS THIS GIRL? Gay: THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON THAT REALLY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED. AND THAT'S CARIL ANN FUGATE. * I DON'T WANT TO PLAY IN YOUR YARD * CARIL ANN WAS THE YOUNGEST GIRL EVER TO STAND TRIAL AS AN ADULT. WE WEREN'T MORE THAN CHILDREN. HOW GUILTY CAN A 14-YEAR-OLD ACTUALLY BE? * I DON'T LIKE YOU ANYMORE * AT THE SAME TIME, WHAT KIND OF 14-YEAR-OLD GOES ON A JOYRIDE WITH A MAN WHO KILLED HER 2-YEAR-OLD SISTER? * YOU'LL BE SORRY * * WHEN YOU SEE ME * * SLIDING DOWN OUR CELLAR DOOR * ADOLESCENTS DON'T HAVE THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO THINK THROUGH CONSEQUENCES. DOES THAT MEAN THAT CARIL ANN DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS WRONG? NO. OF COURSE NOT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, TEENS ENGAGE IN MAGICAL THINKING. YOU KNOW, "WE'RE GONNA LIVE TOGETHER IN THE HOUSE FOR 6 DAYS WITH THESE DEAD PEOPLE HERE AND THINGS ARE JUST GONNA WORK OUT." DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL? TEENS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND CONSEQUENCES THAT ADULTS HAVE. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING TO HURT SOMEONE WITH IT. LOSING MY GRANDPARENTS CREATED A BIG VOID. I WONDER WHAT MY FATHER WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE. IT GOES ON AND ON. THE REAL MYSTERY ISN'T HOW CHARLIE AND CARIL ANN DID WHAT THEY'VE DONE. IT'S HOW COULD THEY? BUT SOME MYSTERIES CAN'T BE SOLVED. A PERSON'S NOT A PUZZLE. AND THE PIECES DON'T HAVE TO FIT TOGETHER JUST RIGHT. ** * YOU CAN HOLLER DOWN MY RAIN BARREL * * YOU CAN CLIMB OUR APPLE TREE * * I DON'T WANT TO PLAY IN YOUR YARD * * IF YOU CAN'T BE GOOD TO ME *
