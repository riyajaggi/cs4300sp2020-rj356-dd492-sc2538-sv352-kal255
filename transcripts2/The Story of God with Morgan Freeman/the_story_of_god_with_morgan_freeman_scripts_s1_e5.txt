 MORGAN FREEMAN: I grew up
 in Mississippi.
 In my neighborhood,
 everyone was black.
 Day-to-day, I didn't see
 overt signs of segregation,
 but when I went up-town,
 it was a different story.
 There's no bus service here
 anymore.
 But when I was a boy...
 I was only allowed
 into one of these doors.
 One said, "white,"
 one said, "colored."
 As a kid, when you're confronted
 with an evil like racism,
 your first reaction
 is confusion.
 Why does this exist?
 Where does it come from?
 ♪♪
 (indistinct shouting)
 For all of our capacity
 to do good,
 the urge to do evil
 has plagued human history.
 (chanting)
 If you believe we live in
 a world under divine control,
 why should evil exist at all?
 ♪♪
 So I'm going on a journey
 to try to understand
 why evil exists.
 I know what you did. My question
 is, can you tell me why?
 ♪♪
 To discover
 how it invades our lives.
 V.A. VIDYA: People who believe
 that they are possessed
 by an evil spirit can come here.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: How evil
 first stole our hearts.
 SALIMA IKRAM: If you're lying
 or doing anything evil...
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Your heart gets
 heavy, and with a heavy heart,
 you're not gonna go to heaven.
 And I'll see how some religions
 train us to fight the Devil.
 ARMAN ARIANE:
 You have two mentalities.
 One is good, and one is bad.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 To turn the darkness...
 BRIAN WIDNER: I did some
 incredibly terrible things.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: ...into light.
 You represent
 the hope of the world.
 ♪♪
 ♪♪
 To understand why evil exists,
 we have to know
 where it comes from.
 Some faiths see it as
 an unseen force that pervades
 the entire world...
 demons that lurk
 in the darkness.
 For Christianity, it could be
 the Devil himself.
 Or is evil something
 that comes from inside us?
 ♪♪
 So, I'm travelling to
 a maximum-security prison
 to meet a man you could call
 evil incarnate.
 So Kent, have you ever come
 face-to-face with evil?
 DR. KIEHL:
 I've met some people who've
 done some very bad things.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Neuroscientist
 Dr. Kent Kiehl is trying
 to pinpoint the source of evil
 inside the brains
 of psychopathic killers.
 DR. KIEHL: I wanted to try
 to understand why people do
 really bad things.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Uh-huh.
 DR. KIEHL: And how
 to help prevent it someday.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Thank you.
 I'm about to meet
 one of Dr. Kiehl's
 most notorious subjects.
 ♪♪
 He's serving
 a life sentence here.
 His attorney tells me this man
 raped more than
 two dozen women...
 ♪♪
 ...and murdered three.
 ♪♪
 ATTORNEY: He's been in jail
 almost since he was a teenager,
 except for very short spurts
 where when he would
 get out of jail,
 he would go back to
 the same behavior of raping,
 and eventually,
 it evolved into murder.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 Did he confess to these?
 ATTORNEY:
 He confessed to all of 'em.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: I'm not
 going to show you his face
 because I don't want to give
 any more notoriety to the man
 who committed these atrocities.
 But I want to know what can make
 someone do what he did?
 You know who I am?
 PRISONER: Yes.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 I know what you did.
 My question is,
 can you tell me why?
 ♪♪
 PRISONER: It was
 a spur-of-the-moment thing.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Each time?
 PRISONER: I didn't have any plan
 to go out and snatch anybody...
 ♪♪
 ...commit any sexual violence
 against anybody.
 I had a desire, an impulse,
 and I wasn't able to stop myself
 from acting on that impulse.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Let me ask you,
 about what age did you start?
 PRISONER:
 Back when I was 21 or 22.
 I was out looking for
 something to steal,
 and I just spotted a teacher
 who had stayed late.
 So I decided to rob her,
 kidnap her, and rape her.
 I just pulled over on an access
 road, and she fought back,
 slipped through the door,
 and I just turned around
 and...took off.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 When did you first kill?
 PRISONER: Going on 27.
 I was going out to
 commit a burglary,
 and...the crime happened.
 (clears throat)
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Kidnapped,
 raped, and murdered?
 PRISONER: Yeah.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: I'm looking
 for the correct term.
 It, isn't guilt, it's remorse.
 Remorse.
 Did you ever experience that
 that you know of?
 PRISONER: I don't see emotions
 like everybody else.
 I don't feel them.
 There was no...remorse.
 I think that I'm not wired
 the same as everybody else.
 -MORGAN FREEMAN: So, Kent.
 -DR. KIEHL: Yeah.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 Is this psychopathic?
 DR. KIEHL: In psychiatry,
 we have a way of assessing
 what we call psychopathy
 or psychopathic
 personality disorder,
 and the lack of empathy,
 the impulse control,
 the poor planning --
 He scores
 in the 99th percentile.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 What makes a person evil?
 Kent has scanned the brains
 of 800 psychopathic criminals.
 This prisoner is the most
 extreme case he's ever seen.
 DR. KIEHL: So this is
 a standard MRI scan.
 It looks pretty normal when
 you run through the MRI scan.
 But what we did is quantify
 all the different areas
 of his brain and to try to
 understand how dense are they?
 How strong are they, basically?
 This area of
 the orbital frontal cortex,
 it's very important for
 the formation of personality,
 for the control of impulses,
 for regulating behavior.
 These three bars
 that I show here,
 this is the average inmate,
 this is other individuals
 that we call psychopaths
 in the red bar,
 and you can see that he is --
 he's really reduced.
 He really does have
 a different brain.
 And so he really does fit
 that 99th percentile.
 He's, you know,
 one-in-a-million, actually.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 One-in-a-million?
 DR. KIEHL: He's very rare.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN: You've been in
 prison now for, what, 30 years?
 PRISONER: Yep.
 (clears throat) Long time.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: What if I said
 I have a way to get you out?
 Would you want to go?
 PRISONER: I'd want to go, but
 since I did commit those crimes,
 I still have that...
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Impulse...
 PRISONER: ...capacity.
 Society wouldn't be safe.
 I don't have the same controls
 as you do
 or somebody else does.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 This is an evil man.
 Evil personified.
 Neuroscientists say that
 his behavior is a result of
 bad neural wiring.
 But the question is, even so,
 does he not still have a choice?
 Can he choose not to commit
 a heinous crime?
 Psychopaths are at the extreme
 of human behavior.
 But we all face the choice
 to do good or do evil.
 ♪♪
 And for thousands of years,
 we've battled those urges.
 ♪♪
 I've come to Luxor,
 capital of ancient Egypt.
 Egyptologist Salima Ikram
 is going to show me one of
 the oldest depictions
 of our struggle to choose
 between good and evil.
 So, right over there?
 SALIMA IKRAM: Mm-hmm. Yes.
 All the east, and to the part
 on the other side of the Nile,
 east of the Nile, was always
 the land of the living.
 ♪♪
 And then over here, you have the
 land of the dead, on the west.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Literally.
 All those are tombs.
 SALIMA IKRAM: Yep.
 All of those are tombs,
 and I want to show you
 one in particular.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: These are
 the tombs of the nobles,
 just around the corner
 from the Valley of the Kings,
 where Tutankhamun was buried
 more than 3 millennia ago.
 SALIMA IKRAM:
 So here's the tomb of Menna.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Menna.
 SALIMA IKRAM: Uh-huh.
 Here we go.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Oh!
 Oh!
 Look at that!
 SALIMA IKRAM: There we are.
 That's Menna, over there, and he
 was a scribe for the god Amun.
 And he oversaw the lands of the
 god Amun, and also over here,
 you can see this big harvest
 that he's checking out.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: It's great.
 They're harvesting their wheat.
 This artwork is 3,500 years old?
 SALIMA IKRAM: Yep. 1370 BC.
 And it hasn't been touched up.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 Those are his scribes.
 He's overseeing the scribes.
 SALIMA IKRAM: Precisely.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: A-ha, ha, ha.
 SALIMA: And...
 MORGAN FREEMAN: When I get back
 to the States,
 I'm gonna be
 a hieroglyphic expert.
 SALIMA IKRAM: You are, indeed.
 Now, let me show you
 a little something
 about how Menna gets
 to go to the afterlife.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Menna's tomb
 includes a remarkable feature
 that Salima tells me
 I have to see.
 ♪♪
 A scene where Menna
 would be judged on the balance
 of good and evil he had done.
 SALIMA IKRAM:
 This all funerary procession.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Okay.
 SALIMA IKRAM: You can see
 his coffin being brought here.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 That's his coffin, there?
 SALIMA IKRAM:
 Uh-huh. That's his coffin.
 And then he's brought here,
 finally,
 in front of the god Osiris.
 ♪♪
 This is Menna.
 And then here, you have
 a complete innovation.
 It's the first time
 you'll ever see this, really,
 in a private tomb, and that is
 the weighing of the heart scene.
 And here he is being judged
 to see if he was good
 or if he was evil.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 In front of Osiris,
 the god of the Underworld,
 Menna's heart is weighed against
 the goddess of truth, Ma'at...
 while Thoth, her husband,
 writes down the judgement.
 SALIMA IKRAM: So it's almost
 as if it's a Cliff Note for him.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 (chuckles) Gotcha.
 Cliff Notes.
 SALIMA IKRAM: So, if you're
 lying or stealing or cheating
 or doing anything evil,
 the whole thing is the fact that
 it reflects on your heart.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: All of that
 weighs on your heart,
 your heart gets heavy...
 SALIMA IKRAM: Mm-hmm.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 I have a heavy heart.
 SALIMA IKRAM: Yes.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 And with a heavy heart,
 you're not gonna go to heaven.
 SALIMA IKRAM: That's right.
 You won't be able
 to have lift-off, basically.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Ah.
 Just -- Good. Well-put.
 (chuckles)
 So in this depiction,
 his heart is indeed in balance.
 SALIMA IKRAM: Mm-hmm.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Right?
 -SALIMA IKRAM: Right.
 -MORGAN FREEMAN: So he's cool.
 -SALIMA: Totally cool.
 -MORGAN FREEMAN: All right.
 SALIMA IKRAM: Good to go
 into the afterlife.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: You would think
 that that would be
 the beginning,
 at least somehow,
 of the Judeo-Christian ethic,
 as it were,
 in terms of good and evil.
 SALIMA IKRAM: Basically,
 I think that modern religion
 has its roots
 in this idea of morality,
 and that anything bad
 you do is reflected
 and can be judged in some way.
 The Egyptians were very literal.
 They said you can judge it
 by your heart.
 But even now, when,
 you know, you can say,
 "He is pure of heart,"
 it means he's a good person.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Right. Right.
 In the centuries after Menna,
 the idea of eternal reward
 for turning one's back on evil
 spread throughout
 Egyptian society.
 And from there, it may have fed
 into Judaism, Christianity,
 and Islam.
 ♪♪
 The weighing of the heart
 assumes that
 fear of consequences is
 the only thing that keeps us
 on a righteous path.
 Which makes me wonder...
 are we inherently good?
 Or inherently evil?
 ♪♪
 In fact, that question
 is at the very root
 of the Christian faith.
 ♪♪
 The early leaders of the church
 trace our tendency to sin
 back to Adam and Eve,
 who ate the forbidden fruit --
 original sin.
 ♪♪
 I've come to meet Baptist
 reverend and theologian
 Kutter Callaway to find out
 whether original sin means
 we are all evil at heart.
 REV. CALLAWAY: Hi.
 Pleasure to meet you.
 -MORGAN FREEMAN: Thank you.
 -REV. CALLAWAY: Have a seat.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Thank you.
 Which book were you reading?
 REV. CALLAWAY: The first
 few chapters of Genesis.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: That is exactly
 what I'm gonna talk about,
 and what I'm want to talk about
 is sin.
 What is original sin?
 REV. CALLAWAY:
 Well, it's a good question.
 The Christian tradition -- it
 kind of coined "original sin."
 Some primal desire
 that we all have,
 that's a very basic
 human urge or impulse.
 Because Adam sinned,
 that original sin was passed on
 from one generation
 to the next -- perpetuated,
 generation after generation
 after generation.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: I have recently
 spent some time with a person
 who we could say personifies...
 REV. CALLAWAY: Mm. Mm-hmm.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: ...evil.
 And you just say,
 "Why did you do these things?"
 And he would say,
 "I just felt like it.
 And beyond that, I don't know."
 Now that's inherent evil.
 Well, isn't it?
 REV. CALLAWAY: What you saw,
 you could name that as
 a sort of demonic thing.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: This is demonic.
 REV. CALLAWAY: It's demonic.
 But I think it's important
 for us to acknowledge that
 that there is a little bit
 of him in all of us.
 There's something inherent in us
 that seems to bend itself
 towards death and violence.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 Is there a Devil?
 Or is that just a metaphor?
 REV. CALLAWAY: It is a metaphor,
 and also, the Devil is real.
 ♪♪
 There's a lot of different
 forms -- you know,
 Devils with pitchforks to
 goblins and ghouls, et cetera.
 In the New Testament, you even
 get Jesus interacting with
 Satan, and yet at the same time,
 you have Jesus talking
 to one of his disciples
 and saying at one point,
 Get behind me, Satan.
 So it seems even Jesus
 is dealing with both
 an actual presence -- what
 we might say is a personified
 evil, and at the same time,
 that we can be satanic, demonic,
 in our own desire to steer away
 from what God wants.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN: We are born with
 the capacity for evil inside us.
 Most of us struggle our whole
 lives to resist the temptation
 to do wrong.
 But that could be another source
 of evil in our lives --
 the people who brought us
 into this world...
 PRISONER:
 My dad was an alcoholic.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: ...whether
 they are living or dead.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Why does
 evil exist in the world?
 Is it because we all
 have evil inside us,
 or does it come
 from somewhere else?
 ♪♪
 I've travelled to India to
 understand what Hindus believe
 is a source of evil --
 the unhappy souls
 of their ancestors.
 I'm in the city of Varanasi to
 visit the temple Pishach Mochan,
 where exorcisms go on
 all day long.
 ♪♪
 My guide,
 Varanasi resident and educator
 V.A. Vidya, introduces me
 to the head priest,
 and to see the
 goblin, or Pischach,
 who is said to live here.
 V.A. VIDYA: So there is
 the goblin, for 15 years,
 just wandering around in pain,
 so he finally prayed to Shiva.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 The great Hindu god Shiva
 puts the goblin through
 a purifying ritual,
 which ends
 with a dip in the nearby pond.
 That instantly
 cures him of his disease.
 In return, Shiva orders
 the goblin to protect people
 near the pond from
 any other evil spirits.
 V.A. VIDYA: Now Shiva asks,
 "Okay, you are cured,
 so you are going to help
 all the people who suffer
 being possessed by evil."
 MORGAN FREEMAN: So this is
 a benign goblin.
 V.A. VIDYA: Yes.
 He's a benign goblin.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Now this pond
 has become a place of healing,
 a haven for people who feel
 their lives are haunted
 by an evil presence.
 V.A. VIDYA: So here,
 look at the water.
 It's brackish, but people
 believe that something is --
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Brackish?
 Is that a term for it?
 V.A. VIDYA: Yeah.
 So, you know, the typical theme
 is water cleanses everything.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Okay.
 I'm gonna buy that.
 V.A. VIDYA: (laughs)
 ♪♪
 Hindus believe that when
 someone's death is traumatic
 or unhappy,
 their soul can become angry
 and haunt the lives of their
 children or other relatives.
 This can cause mental
 or physical illness
 even financial troubles.
 ♪♪
 The correct rituals, however,
 can liberate the unhappy soul
 and free the living.
 ♪♪
 What's going on over there?
 V.A. VIDYA: That's the Shaman.
 He is preparing.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: He's exorcising?
 V.A. VIDYA: Yes.
 MAN: (chanting)
 V.A. VIDYA:
 Their conversation --
 no one can understand.
 It's done in a --
 MORGAN FREEMAN: What,
 they're speaking in tongues?
 V.A. VIDYA: He's speaking
 in tongues, yes.
 And then the patient responds --
 either screams
 or responds in tongues.
 Or they have spasms.
 And then finally,
 they believe that it's released.
 MAN: (groans)
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Most of the
 people who come here don't need
 a full-on exorcism
 like this man.
 (praying in native language)
 The Shukla family
 are typical clients.
 They are having money troubles,
 and they worry that the spirits
 of their ancestors
 may be the cause.
 (praying in native language)
 V.A. VIDYA:
 This is a departure ritual
 for the spirit
 that is wandering around.
 (chanting)
 MORGAN FREEMAN: What gives you
 the impression,
 what makes one think,
 "Oh, my parents' spirits
 are not settled"?
 V.A. VIDYA:
 I think personal troubles.
 Them, something is
 causing them trouble,
 whenever there's
 a financial loss in the family,
 and frequent sicknesses,
 bad dreams, and --
 so everything is associated
 with this procession.
 (praying in native language)
 MORGAN FREEMAN: To make
 their ancestors' spirits happy,
 the Shuklas must
 prepare them a good meal --
 one that is blessed
 by the priest.
 V.A. VIDYA: They offer honey,
 clarified butter, banana,
 fruits, and everything.
 And this would be offered
 to dead soul,
 which is gonna eat the food,
 so this will be a special meal.
 ♪♪
 After receiving all the food,
 they offer a lamp
 and an umbrella
 and a pair of shoes.
 So here, every departed soul is
 treated like a real human being.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: The spirit?
 V.A. VIDYA: Yes. The spirit is
 treated like a real human being.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN: The ancestors
 receive what they need
 for their journey
 in the afterlife.
 After the Shuklas offer the food
 to the sacred pond
 and nail a coin
 to this holy tree...
 ♪♪
 ...the unhappy souls
 of their ancestors are set free,
 and the shadow of evil lifts.
 ♪♪
 In Christianity, you've got
 the Devil and you've got God,
 you've got good,
 you've got evil.
 Don't seem to have that
 going on in Hinduism.
 V.A. VIDYA: In Hinduism,
 there's no dichotomy between
 good and evil -- the same person
 can become good and evil.
 In a temple like this,
 even the evil is treated
 very respectfully
 and is treated caringly.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 That's very interesting.
 Very interesting concept.
 Because I think it sort of
 frees us up to be better.
 V.A. VIDYA:
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
 There's always, at the end,
 the hope.
 The hope that even the evil
 can be liberated.
 And evil can be purified,
 like taking a dip into the pond.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 So I've been watching people
 in these temples -- I mean,
 crowds of people -- doing ritual
 after ritual, trying to stay
 in the good graces of
 their ancestors.
 But the thing about it is,
 evil is not spurned.
 Evil is thought of as
 a spirit that needs help.
 Just...needs to find peace.
 Cool.
 ♪♪
 Hindus want to guide evil
 into becoming good.
 That idea is also the basis
 of another faith...
 ♪♪
 ...one of the oldest
 and most influential religions
 in the world,
 but it's one most of us
 have never heard of.
 It's called Zoroastrianism.
 ♪♪
 I've come
 to Orange County, California,
 to meet the president of
 the temple here, Arman Ariane.
 ARMAN: Welcome to California
 Zoroastrian Centre.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Thank you.
 Zoroastrianism began
 3,500 years ago in ancient Iran.
 The central symbol of the faith
 is fire.
 Today, there are just a few
 small pockets of Zoroastrians
 around the world,
 mostly in India and Iran.
 But some are here in California.
 ARMAN: This is the fire temple.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 This fire is always going?
 ARMAN: This is a symbol
 of Zoroastrianism.
 The fire's always going.
 It represents enlightenment,
 and the more you are aware
 of this world of ours,
 the more you know what's ahead,
 the better decisions
 you can make.
 It's kind of like you are
 walking with a flashlight
 in your hand.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah. The
 brighter the light in your life.
 ARMAN: That's right.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: How does that
 tie in to Zoroastrian belief in
 the separation of good and evil?
 (screaming)
 ARMAN: In Zarathustra's school
 of thought,
 you have two mentalities, which
 are translated by Westerners
 as spirits.
 One is good, and one is bad.
 They are principles.
 They are a way of behaving.
 So the Zoroastrian motto is
 Good Thoughts, Good Words,
 and Good Deeds.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Zoroastrianism
 is a religion focused on
 defeating evil.
 ♪♪
 Zoroastrian priests wear clean,
 white robes...
 which, like their sacred flame,
 represent enlightenment,
 the path away from evil.
 (praying in Avestan)
 Prayers are still said
 in the ancient Iranian language,
 Avestan, which was spoken
 by its founder, Zoroaster.
 (praying continues)
 Professor of Religion
 Gregory Riley had been studying
 how Zoroastrian beliefs
 shaped Judaism and Christianity
 and how they gave birth
 to the idea of the Devil.
 (screaming)
 Zoroastrianism predates
 the Abrahamic religions.
 GREGORY RILEY:
 That's right. Yeah.
 Zoroaster postulated that
 to defeat evil in the world,
 we're gonna have to have
 a cataclysmic battle.
 (thunder rumbles)
 (horse neighs)
 And God and the Devil
 are gonna fight it out.
 (snarling)
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 That's New Testament. That's
 not in Zoroastrian, though.
 GREGORY RILEY:
 Yes, it is Zoroastrianism. Yeah.
 And if you go to the great mass
 of religions around,
 there's no Devil.
 The Israelites --
 they lived without a Devil
 until they are in Babylon.
 The Jews met Zoroastrianism, and
 they began to assimilate ideas.
 They come back,
 and the Devil begins to appear
 in Jewish literature --
 these ideas about the Devil
 having caused that evil.
 And those things
 start to work on people.
 So by the time
 we get to Jesus' day,
 they've actually created a name
 for the Devil -- Beelzebub,
 if you've heard that one.
 -MORGAN FREEMAN: I have.
 He's got a few of 'em.
 -GREGORY RILEY: Yeah.
 So the great competitor of Jesus
 in our New Testament
 and Gospels.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 This is now a new take.
 GREGORY RILEY: That's right.
 Jews make it their own.
 Christians make it their own.
 Islam makes it their own.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN: But just
 as the idea of the Devil
 in Christianity
 evolved from ancient beliefs,
 modern Zoroastrianism
 has evolved, too.
 For many Zoroastrians,
 the Devil is no longer
 a real demonic figure.
 It's an internal combatant --
 the struggle
 between good and evil
 is one that takes place
 in the mind.
 ♪♪
 GREGORY RILEY:
 So the Zoroastrian motto
 is Good Thoughts, Good Words,
 and Good Deeds,
 and the order is very important
 because you start
 with a thought,
 you talk it with a mentor
 before you take any actions.
 This way, you don't
 get yourself in trouble.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 And there is no...Satan.
 There is no Devil.
 Something outside,
 influencing us.
 GREGORY RILEY: Right.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 Meaning, therefore,
 that God is resident
 in each of us.
 GREGORY RILEY: Each of us.
 ♪♪
 (praying in Avestan)
 The Zoroastrian school
 of thought is not something
 in the past or future, but what
 we can do at this very time.
 All our problems
 in the world are man-made.
 Therefore,
 they should be solved by man.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Can be. Must be.
 GREGORY RILEY: To blame it
 on a supernatural force is not
 a Zoroastrian notion.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Right.
 Zoroastrians believe that good
 and evil exists within us all
 and we must make
 the choice for good.
 Each one of us has to purge evil
 from within us every day
 by...doing good.
 Doing the right thing.
 Purging the world of evil
 is not the work
 of messiahs, kings, prophets.
 It's the work of each one of us.
 Be we tailor, butcher,
 salesman, actor, whoever we are.
 I like that.
 But is it really possible
 to conquer evil without
 the threat of a real devil?
 Without the threat
 of eternal punishment?

 BOY: Oh.
 JESSE BERING: All right.
 Why don't you guys make a circle
 and sit in front of me here, and
 I'll go over the rules for you.
 See this piece of tape?
 The first rule is that

 Oh! (chuckles)
 Not that easy, is it?

 the machinations in his mind.
 Let's see if he does it.
 You can hardly blame
 a 6-year-old for doing that.
 He really wants the prize and
 thinks he can get away with it.
 And it's the normal
 child response.
 ♪♪
 This little girl, look at her,
 she's going right over the line.
 And she's putting several balls
 on the board itself,
 and she's checking now to see if
 anybody's actually watching her
 or can see what she's just done.
 They think
 they're alone in the room,
 and why not cheat
 if you can get away with it
 and nobody's watching?
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN: But what if
 someone was watching?
 Jesse runs the exact
 same experiment on a new group
 of children and an invisible
 supernatural being.
 JESSE BERING:
 Now, before we begin,
 I wanted to introduce you guys
 to somebody really special,
 who's in the room
 with us right now.
 Now, her name is Princess Alice.
 Have any of you ever heard
 of Princess Alice before?
 She's a very friendly
 magical princess,
 and she's got
 a very special ability --
 she can make herself invisible.
 ♪♪
 Princess Alice is sitting
 in that chair right now.
 So you guys go upstairs for now,
 and then we're gonna bring you
 each down individually
 to play the game.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: With the kids
 believing they are under
 the gaze
 of an invisible princess,
 Jesse sees something remarkable.
 JESSE BERING:
 Now, this little girl --
 She's been pretty good so far.
 Clearly not interested
 in breaking the rules.
 So here we've got a little girl
 who's actually
 touching the chair
 to see if maybe she can feel
 Princess Alice sitting there.
 GIRL: Princess Alice?
 JESSE BERING: Oh, she's
 saying, "Princess Alice,"
 so she's clearly
 not cheating here.
 JESSE: That's the power
 of belief, you know?
 That these kids have never
 heard of her before,
 but all of a sudden,
 she becomes real in their minds.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Jesse's results
 are always the same.
 JESSE BERING: So what we've seen
 after testing hundreds of kids
 with this study is that
 kids that are told
 that Princess Alice
 is in the room with them
 when they're left alone
 are significantly less likely
 to cheat.
 ♪♪
 She's doing the same thing that
 any supernatural agent or god
 would do in a given society --
 she is watching them,
 she cares about their
 social behavior, and ultimately,
 at least, the implicit
 assumption is that somehow
 she will act if they violate
 one of the rules.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Jesse's research
 suggests that we need to believe
 we're being watched
 to eliminate selfish behavior
 to keep evil in check.
 JESSE BERING:
 So the proverbial question is,
 would you rob a bank
 if you thought that nobody
 could possibly know
 that you've done that?
 And I think if we're honest
 with ourselves,
 many of us would walk in there
 and actually take
 all that currency.
 An all-seeing, all-knowing,
 all-powerful interventionist,
 moralistic deity
 that helps steer people in
 the direction of good behavior.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 The reward of heaven
 and the threat of
 eternal punishment in hell
 keep us on the right track.
 But what about those
 who have succumbed to evil?
 Can faith lead us to redemption?
 Or does evil mark us for life?
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 I'm travelling the world
 to discover why people believe
 evil exists.
 Christians, Jews,
 and Muslims believe it's part
 of the human condition
 to be tempted to do wrong.
 Many faiths urge us
 to fight temptation...
 to put the greater good
 ahead of our self-interest.
 But can we actually
 rid ourselves of evil?
 In Sarnath, India...
 I witness how Tibetan Buddhists
 purged themselves
 of evil thoughts.
 (all chanting)
 The monks here at the
 Vajra Vidya monastery perform
 daily chanting rituals.
 (chanting continues)
 The music puts them in
 a meditative state of mind.
 (chanting continues)
 Buddhists believe the urge to
 do evil stems from our ignorance
 of how our minds work.
 (horns sounding)
 The ritual helps these
 young monks locate the source
 of those bad thoughts...
 so that they can understand
 their cause and overcome them.
 (siren wails)
 But not everyone wants
 to fight their inner demons.
 ♪♪
 There are plenty of people who
 seem to be hell-bent on
 doing bad things.
 (gunshots)
 Is there any way to change them?
 ♪♪
 I've asked Kent Kiehl,
 the neuroscientist who
 studies psychopaths,
 to meet me again.
 I want to know
 if his brain scans
 give us a way to combat evil.
 I mean, we always accept evil
 as...how it is.
 It just is. There's nothing
 we can do about it.
 But could these brain scans
 be used maybe to intercept
 some young people
 before they get going on this?
 DR. KIEHL: I think they can.
 When we understand the systems
 of the brain that are different
 in people who commit
 these bad crimes,
 it gives us an opportunity
 to try and develop
 a treatment for that.
 It's like, if you, you know,
 if I injure my arm and my --
 this muscle gets atrophied, just
 like these certain areas of
 the brain are atrophied, I might
 be able to develop a treatment
 program that remediates
 that atrophy and fix it.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: At about
 what age range would you think,
 as an expert,
 you would have to start looking?
 DR. KIEHL: Following Sandy Hook
 elementary-school shooting
 in the United States,
 we were asked by the parents
 who lost their children there
 to do that study
 to analyze the brains of kids
 that we've studied who've killed
 other people versus
 kids in prison who have not,
 and when we did that analysis,
 I wasn't sure that we would
 find anything that different,
 but we really did.
 Certain areas
 of the temporal lobes,
 of the emotional areas of
 the brain, were underdeveloped,
 where they hadn't achieved
 a normal development.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 So when you say "kids,"
 what are you talking about?
 DR. KIEHL: 14, 5, 16. Yeah.
 So that's the kids
 we were working with.
 Unfortunately, those kids
 had killed about 16 people.
 The neuroscience today is about
 10, 11, 12, we think,
 that we could help identify and
 separate kids that are problems
 versus kids
 that are just disruptive
 and are gonna grow out of it.
 If you were a judge
 and you wanted to know
 is this a high-risk kid
 or a low-risk kid, we can say,
 "This is a high-risk kid."
 We now have a tool
 that can help us understand
 or can help predict
 the worst type of things
 that we all want to prevent --
 a homicide, a death.
 What we really want to be able
 to do is get better and better
 at predicting, and then
 that'll help us be better
 and better at preventing.

 MORGAN FREEMAN: Science may help
 identify those who are most
 prone to evil.

 MORGAN FREEMAN: I'm looking
 for Brian -- Brian Widner.
 Morgan Freeman.
 BRIAN WIDNER: Brian Widner.
 How are you?
 MORGAN FREEMAN: I'm very well
 indeed. How are you?
 BRIAN WIDNER:
 I am doing well, sir.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Tell me
 something about yourself.
 I hear terrible things.
 BRIAN: Well, for 16 years,
 I was a Neo-Nazi skinhead.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 A Neo-Nazi skinhead.
 BRIAN: Yes, sir. I was in
 multiple skinhead gangs.
 I was an enforcer in one, did
 some incredibly terrible things
 to a lot of undeserving people.
 I was an evil person.
 I wanted to hurt the world.
 That's all I wanted to do.
 I was -- I had a sense of just
 utter destruction for everybody.
 That was my driving goal.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Let me ask you,
 how did you get to the street,
 and why were you on the street?
 BRIAN WIDNER:
 I fell in with a gang,
 basically, is what happened.
 I fell in with the wrong people.
 (shouting "Sieg Heil")
 I was 14 years old,
 and I was running the streets.
 These guys gave me a place
 to stay, they bought me beer,
 made me feel accepted
 and wanted.
 And after about my 10th year,
 I kind of realized
 this is a subculture
 of degenerates.
 I realized
 I'm not superior to anybody.
 In fact, I was pretty well
 a lower form of humanity,
 you know?
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Okay. Now,
 we're up to 10 years after
 you've been running around
 with these people,
 and you've had an epiphany.
 Tell me a little bit about that.
 BRIAN WIDNER:
 Some really just magical things
 just kind of happened
 out of nowhere.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Like?
 BRIAN WIDNER: Well I went to
 a skinhead concert in 2005,
 and I met a woman there.
 And by the January of 2006,
 we got married.
 By February, she was pregnant.
 It was, I had to start
 taking a hard look at
 what I was doing with myself.
 I'm bringing this child
 into a world,
 and I told 'em I can't
 do this anymore, I'm done.
 I got to take care of my son.
 So during that time, I made
 the change on the inside,
 I actually had to make a
 physical change on the outside.
 -MORGAN FREEMAN: How was that?
 -BRIAN WIDNER: Let me show you.
 That is what
 I used to look like.
 I mean, my neck
 was completely sleeved-out,
 my face was sleeved-out.
 I looked the part.
 I couldn't escape the way
 I looked on the outside,
 even though I had already
 changed on the inside.
 I got in contact with the
 Southern Poverty Law Center.
 They actually set it up to where
 I was able to get the tattoos
 taken off my face.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Well, now,
 I mean, I can see little
 indications of scars, that,
 more like you were maybe
 in a fight at some point,
 and it healed up.
 It doesn't look like you had
 all this stuff removed.
 How long a process was that?
 BRIAN WIDNER:
 It took about 2 1/2 years.
 There was 25, 26 treatments,
 something like that.
 Every two weeks,
 I was getting laser-zapped.
 It was ungodly, excruciating.
 My face was constantly swollen.
 I looked like the Elephant Man.
 It was a bad time.
 And here's actually a picture
 of me during the process.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: That looked like
 you got punched in the eye.
 BRIAN WIDNER: Yes. It looks like
 I was a bad boxer, yeah.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.
 (both laugh)
 Sort of like paying dues.
 BRIAN WIDNER:
 I very much looked at it
 as a penance, actually, yes.
 I took the pain to --
 as a reminder that
 I've caused enough,
 so I might as well have some.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Can you describe
 to me your sense of yourself
 in those times,
 in terms of evil?
 BRIAN: Looking back,
 I had absolutely no remorse.
 I was borderline sociopathic.
 I had no feelings.
 I wanted to hurt the world.
 When I was going through
 the tattoo removal, I found God.
 Before that, I was a pagan,
 and my life was always dark.
 I always had a hole in my soul,
 I guess,
 would be the best
 way to put that.
 I don't know exactly
 what his name is
 or if it's even Judeo-Christian.
 There is a godly presence
 in the universe,
 and it made itself known to me.
 It helped me realize
 that there is good and evil
 in all of us, and my goal now
 is basically when I just leave
 this world a better place than
 when I got into it, you know?
 Just try to be a good person.
 That's all I can do,
 and I hope that's good enough.
 MORGAN FREEMAN:
 We have...sometimes...
 thoughts that evil just exists
 and there's no hope.
 But you represent
 the hope of the world.
 That transformation --
 that complete transformation
 that you, yourself, made.
 BRIAN WIDNER: Absolutely.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: And for you to
 be able to just completely turn
 yourself around like that,
 it is very, very encouraging.
 And I'm honored to talk to you.
 BRIAN WIDNER: Thank you.
 ♪♪
 MORGAN FREEMAN: Well,
 I've got to tell you something
 I've been noticing.
 You're a good-looking man.
 BRIAN WIDNER: Well, thank you.
 And so are you, by the way.

 MORGAN FREEMAN: The outward
 stains of Brian's past
 have been wiped away.
 But I'm struck by
 the astonishing difference
 in his two lives on the inside.
 That was evil in his heart.
 His admission.
 Deep and remorseless.
 But, he says,
 the birth of his son
 and a dawning belief in God
 is what purged him of evil.
 If Brian can do that, it gives
 us hope that people can change.
 Evil can be contained.
 ♪♪
 This hope is at the core
 of the Christian faith.
 MINISTER: We have gathered today
 on this riverbank
 to perform one of the oldest
 traditions in our faith --
 that of baptism.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: People sin, but
 those sins can be washed away.
 MINISTER: We follow
 Jesus' example today
 as we baptize Austin, Katie,
 Abby, Norman, and Chris.
 These five do this as a sign
 of repentance
 and forgiveness of sin.
 Baptism points the direction
 to where we are headed,
 and it's a new start on life.
 MORGAN FREEMAN: The Bible tells
 us Adam and Eve knew no evil
 until they ate
 the forbidden fruit.
 Almost every faith tells
 the story of how evil begins.
 Whether we believe
 it comes from unhappy souls...
 the Devil himself...
 or the Devil within...
 (thunder crashes)
 ...we all eventually
 come face-to-face with evil.
 But I think
 we need to know evil,
 because in spite of
 all the suffering it causes,
 it drives us to do good.
 Without evil, how would we have
 ever developed
 our unique
 human characteristics --
 the ability to express kindness,
 mercy, forgiveness?
