 The Guardian (2001â€“2004): Season 1, Episode 4 - Lolita? - full transcript 
 Nick wants to handle the case of a factory in trouble, which needs to reorganize or shut down. Father Burton Fallin refuses to accept the client, allegedly because there's no profit in it and risk of face loss, but Nick insists and finds the real reason is a family grudge. Nick is offered a way out of his 1500 hours community sentence, as his 'spoiled' MO hardly squares with the overworked public office. While he considers it, he handles the case of April Evans, who claims to be raped by her cop stepfather Al Sandro, who denies abusing her or her mother, who sides with him. Nick finds out the truth.
