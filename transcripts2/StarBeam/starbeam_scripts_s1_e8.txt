 - It's Miserable Marla. - That's right. And do you know what I wished? For everybody at this party to have a miserable time. Hey, Marla! Remember what they say about birthday wishes? If you say what you wished for, it doesn't come true. Bubble Beam, blast! Thanks, StarBeam! Happy birthday! Hey, thanks! See, Miserable Marla? You can make it rain and be nice. Just wait and see how miserable I'll be next time, StarBeam! Stopping troubles with bubbles. Nice job. - Thanks, Henry. - Hey, where's Kipper?

 Come on, Kipper. Gramps is making us lunch. Hi, Gramps. Oh, hey, ZoZo! How did it go? Great! Miserable Marla was trying to ruin a birthday, so I helped her take her gloomy rain out of there. Hey, Mum! Hi, sweetie. Hi, Henry. Hi! Gesundheit! Thank you, Henry. I don't like the sound of those sniffles one bit. You might be coming down with something. This could be a case of the Super Sniffles. The Super Sniffles? Oh, it's serious business. Superheroes do everything powerfully so something like the sniffles can make it hard to control their superpowers. Gesundheit, again. Thanks. Maybe you should lie down, Mum. That's what you tell me when I don't feel good. Yes, indeedy. You really should rest today. Oh, no. Super villains don't take sick days, so neither do I. Besides, I'm not really sick. I... Okay. Maybe it is the Super Sniffles. Thanks, sweetie, but I really shouldn't just lie here. See? Someone needs a superhero. Sorry, Mum. We're taking super care of you and that's final. Now, you've got a fluffy pillow. Here are digest magazines you've been wanting to catch up on. Kipper, did you find the extra tissues? Thanks! How's it coming, Henry? Almost done laser-proofing the TV. I made you my patented Get Better citron tea. It's sure to cure your sniffles. I do feel better. I think this tea did the trick. Thanks, Dad... It worked! With a sneeze like that, you'll need something stronger. If I could isolate the healing properties of the citron fruit, - I might be able to grow a super citron. - To make a super tea! Henry, let's get to the lab and science ourselves up some super fruit. - And I'll stay here and take care of Mum. - Well, good luck. That's a harder task than you think. Can I get you anything else, Mum? Mum? Mum? Mum? Mum... says she can't wait to try the super tea. Got to go! Bye! Mum! Super Sniffles or not, somebody out there needs help. Bubble Beam, blast! Thanks, Zoey. So how exactly are you going to juice up this fruit? With this! I call it the Fruit-o-fortifier. And have you tested that gizmo? No. But trust me, this is going to work. Hey, look at that. It worked. Henry, I'm sorry I ever doubted... There! Your mission is to stay right here and get better. You're right. Now, I'll go make you a snack. Okay, I've made some adjustments and I'm positive this is going to work this time. I'm sort of positive this thing is going to work this time. Let's do this! Look at that! Okay, maybe don't look at it. Hey, Mum. I didn't know what you were hungry for, so I made you everything. Mum? I guess superheroes aren't very good at resting. Time to shine! It's time to shine! Going to save the world Superhero girl Shine! StarBeam! Small and mighty It's time to shine! Got to find Mum and get her back home. Where are you? I think I know where to look. You think you're miserable now. Well, your Super Sniffles are about to get worse. Help! Wonder Blast, activ... Oh, no. What have I done? I'm on it. Bubble Shield, go! Hey, Mum... WonderBeam. You're supposed to be in bed. You're right. I'm causing more harm than good. What's the matter, WonderBeam? Feeling under the weather? Miserable Marla! I don't think I can hold this one back, StarBeam. That's it. Let's see how miserable everybody is after you sneeze-laser the whole city. Guess again, Miserable Marla! Don't worry, Mum. I got this. Happy to help. That StarBeam! I never thought I'd have to go battle my own mum. Don't you ever give up? No. My bubble! Mum's lasers are too powerful for me to deflect. Take a moment, take a breath, make a plan and try your best. The laser-proof TV shield, of course! This should work. Don't you have a garden to water? Seriously... again? This is so miserable! - I'm so proud of you, sweetie. - Thanks. Now, can we try resting? Yes, ma'am. I did it! My Fruit-o-fortifier finally made the Citron super. Henry, that is the best super Citron tea I have ever had. Really? We can make some more. There's still a little Citron left over. Actually, there's a lot left over. You know, I'm not feeling so sniffly anymore. Henry, your super tea! It worked. I don't know if it was the tea or just having all of you around to take care of me, but I sure do feel a lot better. No more Super Sniffles in this lighthou-- Oh, no. - Gesundheit. - I'll go make some more tea. It's time to shine! - Going to save the world - Fly! - Superhero girl - Get tough! Small and mighty It's time to shine StarBeam! It's time to shine StarBeam! Small and mighty It's time to shine! StarBeam!
