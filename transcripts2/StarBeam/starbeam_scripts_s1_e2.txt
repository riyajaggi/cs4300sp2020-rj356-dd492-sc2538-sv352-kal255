 Red Bean Buns! And I've got everything else we need, thanks to my new invention... the Party Pack-orama! Nice moves. Gramps is working in BeamControl. If he hears us, it might ruin the surprise. Gramps is working... on his birthday? You know Gramps. He says trouble doesn't take a day off, so neither can he. Birthday or no birthday. But how will we set up? People will be here soon. I'll try to get him to go out for a bit. Can you finish this, Mum? Sure. No problem.

 Okay. This isn't so hard. Hey, Gramps. What are you up to? I'm upgrading the BeamControl security system. I'm a little nervous. While the system's upgrading, the beam key's vulnerable, and if Todd somehow got that key... That's important alright. But it's your birthday. You should be doing something fun. Hey, I know! How about a fishing trip while you wait for it to finish? You love fishing. That I do. Zoey, you convinced me. I'll do it. Yes! But keep your eye out for any funny business. Don't worry. With two superheroes in the house, BeamControl and the key will be perfectly safe. I promise. It's time, Goop. Once you bring me the key from BeamControl, I can break out of here. I, the great and powerful Todd, will now be free to ruin the world. Got to go. Oh, no. Have fun fishing! Operation Birthday Party is a go! - Zoey, Henry, you're on decorations. - We're on it! The cookies are ready. And my mum is on her way with the birthday cake. Wait for me! I hope Gramps is surprised. Oh, he'll be surprised all right. Lime jelly? Yuck. Kids! Can you help me for a moment? Oh, look, a piñata! Oh, Zoey thought of everything. Kipper! Those cookies are for guests. Cookie! Where shall we put the balloons? - Henry, what happened? - I tripped on a skateboard. What skateboard? Wait a second. Something weird is going on. Jelly appeared out of nowhere, and now it's gone. And that piñata you put up, it's gone too. Things are appearing and disappearing everywhere. That can only mean one thing. Goop! I bet he's after the key to free Todd. We can't let that happen. But how did Goop get inside? I think I let him in. He looked like a birthday present. We have to find Goop. I promised Gramps we'd keep BeamControl safe. Time to shine! Let's split up. I'll protect BeamControl. - I'll take the living room. - I'll take the kitchen. And hurry! Guests will be here any minute. Goop could be anywhere. Goop? Are you in here? Phew. BeamControl secured. Goop, I know you're here somewhere. I can really use some yummy popcorn. Oh, no, you don't! GoSneaks, let's go! Mum, we need back-up. I'll stop him with my bubble power. Bubble Beam, blast! Whoops. Oh, no, it's my mum. Try and distract her while we get Goop. Oh... Hi, Mum. Hi, honey. I brought the cake. Where's Zoey? She's getting ready for the party. Hey, Mum, look at my new invention. I call it the Party Pack-orama. - That's wonderful, but-- - Look! A party hat dispenser. - Ta-da! - Henry, is everything okay? StarBeam! He's in the Beam-evator. - He could be anywhere. - Don't worry, honey. We'll find him. - What was that? - Music... for the party. Dance with me, Mum! Let me put the cake down first. Henry, what is going on here? I can't quite figure it out. - Surprise! It's my confetti cannons. - Henry! Oh, what a mess. It'll ruin the surprise. I'll find a broom. There isn't one... inside. I think it might be outside. It's time, Goop. BeamControl's security system is down and the key is ours for the taking. Gotcha, Goop! I feel awful. I promised Gramps I'd keep BeamControl safe. Don't worry, honey. We'll find him. Did you get him? No. He's hiding somewhere up here. Where's your mum? She'll be busy for a while. The cake looks great. Gramps will love that cake topper. It didn't have a cake topper. No! Bubble Beam, blast! - Yes! - Yeah! Finally. Quick, hide! What in the world! Sorry, Mum. I totally forgot. I have a vacuum in my Pack-orama. Let's send Goop back where he came from. Would you like to do the honours? I sure would! Bye, Goop. You're growing up to be quite the superhero. I'm so proud of you. Thanks, Mum. It's much more fun to catch villains with you. The security upgrade's complete. Perfect timing. The party's about to start. Yeah! He's coming, everyone. Get ready. Hooray! Surprise! Happy birthday! So this is why you wanted to get rid of me. Was everything okay while I was gone? It was a piece of cake. Happy birthday, Gramps. Make a wish! It already came true. Kipper! It's time to shine! - Going to save the world - Fly! - Superhero girl - Get tough! Small and mighty It's time to shine StarBeam! It's time to shine StarBeam! Small and mighty
