 I want to take care of Quincy so badly. So, so, so, so badly! And tonight's critter sitter is... Zoey! Yes, yes, yes! Yes! Hey, buddy, it's me, your pal Zoey. I've been waiting for this day, like, well... forever. Look! There's us on the first day of school. You were the most adorable butterfly egg ever! There's you taking your first tiny caterpillar steps. There's us learning we both love salad. I can't wait to add more pictures from our adventures tonight, you cute little chrysalis. And one day, you'll be a butterfly!

 Taking care of little Quincy is a big responsibility, Zoey. I know you'll return him to class tomorrow safe and sound. Quincy's super safe with me. I promise. Wait here for a second. No peeking, Quincy. Okay, you can come on in! Surprise! Welcome home, Quincy. Well, at least until tomorrow. Quincy, get ready to have the most amazing day of your life. And Henry, can you take pictures so we'll always remember this epic day? Oh, yeah. This is my bedroom, where we'll be having our sleepover. And these are my toys. You can play with any ones you want. And this is a fresh breeze from Summersette Bay. Do chrysalises get hungry? Don't know, but a party could always use some snacks. Yeah! Kipper, can you keep an eye on Quincy? Make sure he doesn't have too much fun without us. Great, thanks! All right, Quincy! Got you a leafy salad with extra leaves. Quincy? He's gone! He must've come out of his chrysalis. That means he's a butterfly now! Where did he go? Quincy, come back! We're coming for you, Quincy. Follow that butterfly! Quincy's having a nectar break. All right, buddy. Time to come back home to critter sitter and... Snail! I've got you covered, Zoey. We've got to get him, Henry. I need to bring him back to school tomorrow. Time to shine! It's time to shine! StarBeam! And how about a little Boost? Everybody ready for a butterfly chase? It's Beam-time! GoSneaks, let's go! There he is! Don't worry, Quincy. We won't let you out of our sight! StarBeam! Help! How can I help you? My goat's stuck. How did your goat get up there? It's a long story. Okay, I guess this won't take long. Bubble Beam, blast! Yeah! Thanks, StarBeam! You're welcome. Did you rescue Quincy? No, but I saved a goat. - Looked like Quincy was headed into town. - I'm on it! StarBeam, please help! I can't seem to find my Muffin. Muffin? What are you doing up there? Don't worry, I'll save him! Thank you, StarBeam. Happy to help. "Don't walk"? Oh, yeah! Time for some GoSneak action! GoSprings, activate! This calls for my Extendo-Net! - Did you find him? - He's headed to the park. Good spot, Boost. Alright, guys, we can't let Quincy flap away from us again. On three, we grab him, okay? - One... - Two... Got you! We were so close. Where did he go? You're not going to believe it, but... Boost, I so need a picture of this! Say sneeze. I mean, cheese. Oh, no. Where did he fly off to now? Quincy? Quincy? Quincy? I can't believe I lost Quincy. Today was supposed to be his amazing day. And now Quincy's gone, out there all alone, and hungry and... That's weird. This one kind of flower is making me sneeze. And it's the same kind of flower Quincy's been snacking on all day. Butterflies do love yummy flower nectar. Right. So what if, instead of us trying to find Quincy, we get Quincy to find us? By giving him the yummiest snack of all time! Boost, can you use these flowers to make the most delicious super nectar ever? Oh, you know I can! To the lab! Behold, the world's most delicious butterfly nectar, ready for its flower. And I have the perfect disguise. It's bloom time. Looking good. Snack time, Quincy! Come and get it! Oh, wow. More butterflies. And more butterflies. And more, and more, and more butterflies! We did it, StarBeam. We got the butterflies to find you. What about Quincy? Which one is he? I can't tell. They all look alike. Quincy? Are you Quincy? Take a moment, take a breath, make a plan and try your best. I know! Let me see the picture you took of me and Quincy. Okay. See? Quincy has a unique wing pattern. You're right! Now we just need to make a match. And bring Quincy home. It's time for that hero pic, with all of us! Everyone say, "amazing day." Amazing day! - Wow! - Sweet! Now that Quincy's completed his metamorphosis, turning from a caterpillar to a butterfly, it's time to set him free. Go, Quincy! Go explore the world. - Yeah! - Bye, we'll miss you! Pets grow up so fast these days. It's time to shine! - Going to save the world - Fly! - Superhero girl - Get tough! Small and mighty It's time to shine StarBeam! It's time to shine StarBeam! Small and mighty
