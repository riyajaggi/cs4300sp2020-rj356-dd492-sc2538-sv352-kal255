 Anchors away! Hoo! A dragon has a brilliant shine The Jewel of Fire will soon be mine! Me treasure! Shiver me timbers! The island's attacking us. Mayday! Mayday! We be going down. This golf shot is impossible. Not impossible, just tricky. My G3 - Get Up and Golf Gizmo can calculate the exact speed, angle and distance for the perfect hole-in-one. If you say so, Henry. Fore! It's working! - Kipper! - Oh. We've got trouble, Zo. Looks like a boat ran aground on Lava Lava Island.

 It's time for you-know-who to do you-know-what! I'm on it, Gramps! That's my girl. Golf will have to wait. Time to shine! It's time to shine! StarBeam! - To Lava Lava Island! - I'll meet you there! Gramps, I see the boat. It's Fishbeard's ship, the Delores! Well, how do you like those apples? Looks like even villains need a superhero sometimes. - I'll bet he's doing something villainy! - Well, even if that's true, our job is to help someone in trouble, and today, that someone is Fishbeard. Just be careful. Hello, Captain Fishbeard. Suffering seabass! It's StarBeam! Whatever you think I did this time, I didn't do it. Don't worry. I'm here to help you. Why, thank ye. Hey! What's that behind your...? Me jewel! Maybe it's because you stole that! Stole what? Oh... this? No, no. I just rescued it from the top of the volcano. It looked lonely up there. Me ship! Captain Fishbeard? He stole this jewel and now the island is attacking his ship. The Jewel of Fire! Captain Fishbeard, haven't you ever heard of the legend of Lava Lava Island? No. The island of Lava Lava Shall not be disturbed. To step on the island Will leave it perturbed. But the one that will set off A fate that's most dire Is the one who steals the Jewel of Fire. Oops. Lava Lava Island is mad that you took the jewel. Now, the only way to make the island happy again is to put it back. "Put it back"? But... it's so shiny and pretty. Captain Fishbeard, I need your help. StarBeam needs my help? Yeah. I need your help to put the jewel back. Only you know where it goes. But the Delores is grounded. There's no way I can get up there. Come on, I'll fly you up. And in the meantime, Boost can fix your ship. I will? Oh, I will. Don't worry, Captain. Ready, Captain? Oh, alright. I can't see anything in this fog. The fog's too thick to fly. And a coconut nearly got my hat. We'll have to cross the island and climb the volcano on foot. On foot? Across the island? But I don't want to go. Everyone knows this island is booby-trapped. Don't worry. I'll make sure you get there in one piece. Come on, Captain! See? This wasn't so bad. Come on, Fishbeard, you can do it. Just make sure you watch where you're going and be very careful. Phew. That was a close one. But I have a feeling this island has more than a few tricks. Help me! Help me! This might be harder than I thought. I don't think I'm cut out for this. Stick a fork in me, I'm done. You can't give up, Captain. I need your help to show me where the jewel goes. You know... taking things is a whole lot easier than returning them. But if it means getting my ship fixed and getting me off this blasted island... I'll do it. We're in this together. Yeah, in this together! I've got blisters in me boots. We're almost there. Hurry, before she blows! We'll never make it. Take a moment, take a breath. Make a plan and try your best. Ow, me head. It's just like golf! If I think about the speed, angle and distance, just like Boost's G3, I can get Fishbeard where he needs to go. Bubble Beam, blast! Wait! You're golfing the wrong way! Do you trust me, Captain? I... I do, StarBeam. Fore! You did it. I knew you could. Leonard. Hey! It looks like you guys could use a ride. Well, thank ye, Boost, for fixing me ship and, thank ye, StarBeam, for.... well, just thanks. - You're welcome. - Bye, Captain. Oh, no! Captain Fishbeard, I left my Fixinator on your ship. But... it's so shiny and pretty. Oh, okay. Here you go. I guess he just can't help himself. It's time to shine! - Going to save the world - Fly! - Superhero girl - Get tough! Small and mighty It's time to shine StarBeam! It's time to shine StarBeam! Small and mighty It's time to shine! StarBeam!
