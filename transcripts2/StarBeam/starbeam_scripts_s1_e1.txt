 So that's where it went. Who's the Cloud-and-Go-Seek champion? That's right. It's me, StarBeam! Good try, Kipper. Another Beam-errific victory. Thanks, Gramps. Ta-da! Do we have any good snacks? All that flying made me hungry. Well then, you're in luck, kiddo. Remember what day it is? Oh, yeah! It's Fun Food Friday, with all the food vans. Can't wait to have a Super Slam Sundae at the ice cream truck. Spaghetti-on-a-Stick, here I come! Sorry, Kipper. There's no anchovy food van.

 Is Mum coming? Afraid she can't make it. Got an alert that the Grey Weasel was stirring up trouble. Well, if anyone can stop him, it's my mum, WonderBeam. That's the spirit. - Ready to go? - What's that, Henry? It's my new invention. I call it the See-and-Shine. This side keeps the sun from shining in my eyes and this side's a mirror so I can see things behind me, like Kipper trying to break into the cookie jar. Hey! Whoops! Sorry about that. Should we lock up and get a move on? Well, I'll be a slippery sardine. I could have sworn my keys were right here. We've got trouble. Shiny things are disappearing all around town! Hey! Didn't a picture of me and Mum used to be here? The picture frame, the keys... Oh, shiny things! Looks like Fun Food Friday will have to wait. To BeamControl! I knew it. It's Captain Fishbeard. Those shiny things They mean so much to me That's why I like to steal them 'Cause they make me so happy Anchors away! Hey! What nice, precious, shiny loot. What else can we get, Leonard? Shivering shininess! Hoist the sails, Leonard. We're going fishing for the biggest, shiniest catch for my collection. I can hardly wait. Fun Food Friday is near City Hall. While everyone's busy filling their tummies... My itchy pinky toe tells me Captain Fishbeard's going to try to steal City Hall's bell. Inside that brand new shiny ringer is the most advanced superhero technology on the planet. You know what this means, Zoey. Time to shine! It's time to shine! Going to save the world Superhero girl Shine! StarBeam! Small and mighty It's time to shine! Let's go, Boost! Go get 'em, StarBeam! Kipper, cover me while I show this thief the way out of town. It's go time. Let's boost! Gramps, Fishbeard's headed for the bell. I knew it. Remember what to do when things start feeling nuttier than a bag of squirrels? Take a moment, take a breath, make a plan and try your best. Thanks, Gramps. Greetings, friends. As mayor of Summersette, I just wanted to thank everyone for coming out today. We're going to have a lot of fun. I... Boost! He's coming your way. GoSneaks, let's bounce! I'm in position. I have travelled far and wide To take my shiny, shiny prize Not on my watch, Captain Fishbeard. Didn't your mum ever teach you not to take things that aren't yours? She also said to stop and smell the fishies. I can't see. Hey! You can't steal what you can't see. Boost! The See-and-Shine! Go brighten up his day! I can't see. Chums away! Gross. Look! Fishbeard's got the bell. He's getting away! Take a moment, take a breath, make a plan and try your best. Plan B. I've got to get the bell off that ship. Come to me. Suffering sea bass. Not you again. Just helping you return something that doesn't belong to you. Bubble Beam... blast! Hold on, Leonard. We're going... Up? Get away from there, you mangy bird! That's how you do it. I'll return the bell and you return everyone's stuff. Way to go, StarBeam. Help! Don't worry, Fishbeard. I'll get some wind back in your sails. No, no! No! I don't know about you, but all this superhero work has made me super hungry. Good thing it's Fun Food Friday! Yeah, and I can get a Red Bean Bun for my mum. Hi, Mum. Hi, sweetie. Have you kids seen StarBeam? I wanted to thank her for saving the bell... and Fun Food Friday. No. Haven't seen her. Thanks to you, Zoey, everyone in Summersette is going to sleep safe and sound... with full bellies. Like mother, like daughter. Huh, Gramps? I'm home. Hi, Zoey. Hi, Dad. Right on cue. Hey, Mum. Hi, sweetheart. I heard you had quite a day. Just some superhero stuff. Oh! I got you a Red Bean Bun. Looks like someone already took a bite. It wasn't me... It might've been me... Okay, it was me.
