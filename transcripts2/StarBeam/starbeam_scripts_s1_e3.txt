 Okay, Kipper. I'll try it again. Cheese. That's it! Zoey, why are you so worried about your smile? It's Picture Day. If you have a cheese-face smile, a big blob of spinach in your teeth, or uneven pigtails... it's captured... forever! Well, no uneven pigtails for you. But you do have some hair sticking up. Let me get that. That's static electricity. Our hair rising and that little zappy feel... is from electricity in the air.

 Sometimes thunderstorms can charge up the air like a big battery. No storms here. Let's see what my Stormometer says. It can detect storms up to 20 miles away. I rigged it to the weather balloon outside the science lab. Going up! Weather balloons can tell us if the air is wet or dry, or how fast the wind's blowing. All that shows up on your Stormometer? Pretty cool! That's weird. It's not detecting a thunderstorm, but there's this static electricity in the air. I'll have to do more investigating. Going down! We better get to class. See you later, Kipper. Hey! Everyone looking their best... smiling. If there's one thing that doesn't go well with perfect pictures, it's a little static cling! Good morning, everyone. Now, take your seats. Ow! - Ow! - Ouch! Say hello to Miss Fox. She's here to take your school pictures. Good morning, Miss Fox. Good morning, everybody. - It sticks! - Miss Winkleman, I can't see! Just put your paper down, Gunther. And my pigtails won't go down! Oh, my! I seem to be in a static-y situation myself. I can't seem to un-cling these picture order forms. Henry, have you figured out what's going on? The static levels are going up. Just like my pigtails! Sure seems like something more than the weather's going on. Those kids seem to be having fun with my static electricity and that's not what was supposed to happen. It's time for me to make things more miserable. What's happening? My braces feel tingly! - Oh, no! - Oh, my goodness! Zoey, look here! My super-static sensor is way past the max! Stormy weather on a clear day... Miserable Marla! She must be really working up a static-y storm. I've got to stop her before it gets worse. I'll stay here and see what I can do to get rid of the static charge in the classroom. - Time to-- - Hey, Zoey! Do you mind? Thanks! Time to shine! It's time to shine! Going to save the world Superhero girl Shine! StarBeam! Small and mighty It's time to shine! Watch out, Miserable Marla! It's Beam-time! Kipper! Bubble Beam, block! Be careful, Kip! Bubble Beam... blast! Gramps! How's it going, Zoey? I think Miserable Marla's making a static-y storm-tastrophe at school. She's ruining Picture Day. That sounds miserable, alright. Can you get a read on her? Sweet sassy molassey! What is it? The storm? No... Miserable Marla's official Villain League photo! And it was captured... forever! Maybe because she took a bad picture, she wants to ruin Picture Day for everyone else. What do you know? The storm, it's heading for the school! I see her! She looks super-duper miserable. Maybe we need to remind her how to shine. Thanks, Gramps. Maybe adding some moisture will help. Henry! Sorry, just trying to help. Marla, would you please stop the static? Now, why would I do that? You're going to ruin Picture Day. Everyone's been practising their happy smiles. Happy pictures make people happy. And I don't like happy. Now move aside, StarBeam! The real static show is just beginning! I am not going to let you ruin Picture Day! Power Beam Breath, blow! Bubble Beam, blast! Blowing bubbles is fun, but popping them... is better! Look! It's StarBeam! And Miserable Marla! StarBeam will save Picture Day! I sure hope so. I'm getting nowhere like this. There has to be another way. Take a moment, take a breath, make a plan and try your best. That's it! I have an idea. Static can be caused by rubbing two things together and moving the charge from one object to another. What if we take away Marla's static energy and move it to the weather balloon instead? Great idea! This won't hurt a bit! Hey! Get away! What are you doing? So long, static! No! It's working! Yeah! StarBeam! My braces aren't tingling anymore. All my awesome static is gone. Sorry, Miserable Marla. I couldn't let you ruin Picture Day just because you had a bad photo. You can have a nice picture too! Say cheese. Cheese. There! Now you look miserable. Let me see! Looking good! No! I'll send it to you! We did it. Cheese. What's that? There's been an update to the Villain League database. Looks like everyone's having a good Picture Day. It's time to shine! - Going to save the world - Fly! - Superhero girl - Get tough! Small and mighty It's time to shine StarBeam! It's time to shine StarBeam! Small and mighty
