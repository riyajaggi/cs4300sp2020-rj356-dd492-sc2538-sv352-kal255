 I can do the step-step-leap, but every time I get to the twirl... Hey! I might have an idea. Maybe these could help. What are those? Shoe-Can-Dos! I designed them to click onto your shoes to keep you steady. Go ahead, try 'em! I don't think they'll go with my tutu. You won't wear them at the dance show. - You only need them to practise. - Really? The Shoe-Can-Dos act like training wheels. Once you learn how to leap and twirl just right, you won't need them anymore. Okay. Here goes!

 - I did it! - What did I tell you? Oh, yeah! I'm ready. I've got to get home for dinner but I'll see you tonight for your show. Okay. See you later! My feet are amazing! Almost time to go to your show, ZoZo. How about I make you one of my super smoothies for some dancing energy? Sure. Thanks, Gramps. Boy, Zoey, you sure love to dance. Anyhow, anywhere. Whoa! Those are some fancy shoes. Yeah, Henry made them for me to help me dance for tonight's show. They help me with my trickiest dance moves. As cool as those are, you need to show everyone that you can dance on your own, without the aid of some fancy gizmo. Don't worry, Gramps. They're just for practice. I'll take them off for the dance show. That a girl! What is it, Gramps? Not sure. I better go to BeamControl to check it out. Don't worry about me. Henry'll be here soon. I can walk to the show with him. Sounds like a plan. I'll be there with Mum as soon as I can. Okay. Time to come off, Shoe-Can-Dos. No! Alright! You are coming off. Zoey, are you ready for the show? Just a minute... Come on! You don't want to be late. Help! How do we make them... stop? - You were supposed to take those off. - I tried but they won't come off. What do you mean "they won't come off?" Well, I... might have messed with the controls a little. And then they might have got smoothied. Interesting. How do we make it stop? We'll have to figure it out on the way. You don't want to be late for your show. I should be able to turn down the shoes with my Fixinator. I've almost got it. - Stand still! - I can't. Okay, Henry. Try again... Zoey! I'll never be able to get close enough if you keep dancing away. Sorry... I can't help it! I found out what's causing the alert, Zo. Looks like Cosmic Crusher is somewhere near your school. Cosmic Crusher? He's never up to any good. I'm on it, Gramps. What about your show? I'll get there, but being a superhero always comes first. Hey, maybe the Shoe-Can-Dos will come off when you become StarBeam. Yeah! Time to shine! It's time to shine! StarBeam! Oh, no! The shoes are still on. And your show is in 15 minutes! Cosmic Crusher. Evening, everyone. Oh, no! It's him. It's Cosmic Crusher! Looks like a fine evening for a little crushing. Not when I'm around! StarBeam! Stop that! Huh? StarBeam! You think you've got super dance moves? Well, you've never seen moves like these! Run! Crushed it! This dance-off is on! Wait! No! I wasn't dancing on purpose. You need to stop before someone gets hurt. Yeah. Or you're just afraid of facing the greatest dancer ever! I've got to help StarBeam turn off those shoes. It's go time! Her feet are too crazy. I can't fix them if she doesn't stop moving. Unless, maybe... I build a remote control. Yeah! Oh, yeah? Anything you can do, I can do crushier. If Cosmic Crusher keeps dancing around here, he's going to really do some damage. I won't stop until I win. What should I do? I've got to get him away from the school and all the people. Take a moment, take a breath. Make a plan and try your best. He won't stop until he wins. That's it! I can just let him win. Hey, Crusher! I bet you can't do this! Anything you can do, I can do crushier. Hope this works. - I did it without the Shoe-Can-Dos! - You sure did! I can do it too! Crushed it! Oh, wow. That was very, very good. Yes. I'm sorry, StarBeam, but Crusher clearly is the better dancer. You win, Cosmic Crusher. You win. Boom! I crushed this dance-off! So, what do I win? Ah, you win... These shoes! Oh! Those are some sweet kicks. And they fit perfectly! Can they go any faster? I bet I could dance even crushier with these! Oh, I'm sure they can with a little... boost. Get ready to boogie down. Oh, yeah! I'm the greatest dancer ever. I'm crushing it! One minute to spare before your show. Go, Zoey! Yeah! - She's a natural. - She sure is. It's time to shine! - Going to save the world - Fly! - Superhero girl - Get tough! Small and mighty It's time to shine! StarBeam! It's time to shine! StarBeam! Small and mighty It's time to shine! StarBeam!
