From Hell...
ALLISON/AMY: Oh!
 I'm so sorry.
 No worries. Accidents happen.
 I'll bet you're a
very sweet person, Dr. Allison.
 How did you know my name?
 It's me, Amy,
from the farmers' market!
 Who's this Bit-O-Honey?
I'm Brad. I'm the brother.
 Your mother died 412
days ago, and since then,
you've buried yourself
  in work, buried yourself in a relationship.
 How do you know all that stuff?
 Honey, I'm your guardian angel.
  He's working on boning your best friend.
 Evan and I hooked up!
(groans)
 It's not that I believe
you're an angel.
 But?
I could use a weird friend.
 Do they come any weirder?
 (chuckles)
 So, remember that weird woman
 from the coffee shop
a few weeks back?
 The one who put a
sexual spell on me?
Yeah. Amy.
 She's been texting, so I told
her she could meet us for lunch.
 Do you think you can keep
your flirting in check?
That was a one-time thing.
 I don't usually go
for a mid-50s woman.
 Hey! Aw...
 Sorry I'm late.
 Hey, you remember
my brother Brad.
 Who could forget the hottest
brother since Idris Elba?
 You're pretty fly
yourself, girl.
Mm!
 It's happening again.
I'm sorry. And it's
a little un-PC this time.
 All right, kids, dig in.
 No arguing. My treat.
 Uh, this is a pizza place...
with their own food.
 This is how hungry I am.
 Should raw oysters
be room temp?
 So, Allison,
 how's the love life?
 Personal. Private.
 I'm all about discretion.
 You know, last night,
I had a lovely time
 with a certain vendor
from the farmers' market,
 and I will not name names,
so don't even try.
 Okay.
 Was it the oyster guy?
 It was the Oyster King of L.A.!
Yes!
 (laughs) And I won't go into
details other than to say
 four orgasms.
 So, Brad,
 what's your O-count these days?
 I'm going through a massive
dry spell. Yeah, uh, two months.
 Two months? Well,
that doesn't make any sense.
I know.
 Oh, come on!
Oh, unless, of course,
 you're still living
in Allison's converted garage.
 Yeah. Still getting back
on my feet after the divorce.
 I'll bet it's hard to seal the
deal when the key to your house
 is the wide button
on a clicker.
 I do tend to lose
'em coming around
 the side gate.
I'll bet you do.
 Maybe what you need is a
change of address, my friend.
 Allison, it's your
turn to share.
 Come on.
Has it been hard
 to get back out there
after the whole Evan fiasco?
 How he
cheated on you.
 With your best friend.
 In your own house...
I got it. I was there.
 Happened to me.
 She has been
a little paralyzed lately.
 No, I have not been paralyzed.
 I opened
an online dating account.
 Well, good for you.
Yeah.
 I found this really great app
where I can study guys' profiles
 and really think
about my choices.
 Not good for you.
And, of course,
 you are overthinking this.
 What you need to do is turn
off the old decision-maker
 and just say... shuck it.
 (slurps)
Mmm!
 That's delicious.
 I'm going in.
Attaboy!
 I don't... think those
are very fresh.
 Mm-mm.
 Couldn't do it. My throat
literally closed up.
 More for me.
(chuckles)
 ♪ ♪
 You got to go with
your gut more, kid.
 Turn off all those
voices in your head.
 Said the woman
claiming to be an angel.
 Oh, whoa, whoa, wait, stop.
Now, you can't tell anybody
 that I'm your
guardian angel, okay?
 That would be
very bad for me.
 Tons of paperwork.
 How 'bout we don't even talk
about the angel stuff?
 Because I don't believe
you're an angel.
 As I was saying,
 go with that guy,
not that guy.
 Grab the free sample, huh?
 Pet the doggy.
Smell the baby.
 (inhales)
Mm. Whoa.
 That is not a
clean baby.
 Ooh, test the
"Wet Paint" sign.
 They're almost always wrong.
 Oh. That one was right.
 Hey, Dad.
 This is Amy. She needs
to use the restroom.
 Bit of a white lie. I just had
to come up and meet Papa Bear.
 (chuckles)
 Marv! Oh! (chuckles)
 You're getting a face full of
the sisters now, aren't you?
 (chuckles)
I'm sorry.
 Or should I say
"You're welcome"?
 "Sorry" works.
 Well, congratulations on
that one. She's a masterpiece.
 Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
 Who are you?
Amy. I'm Allison's new pal.
 Hey, anybody want
to buy some oysters?
 Only a couple dozen left.
 MARV:
Yeah, no, you can't
 sell seafood
in the office.
 Oh, of course, yes.
 Beverly Hills, hmm?
 MARV:
Allison, do you know
 how late you are? That's
a real question, by the way.
 My watch stopped working again.
I know, and I feel terrible.
 But I did text Nancy,
and she pushed my 2:00.
 Cool if I come
backstage?
 And that area's
no longer sanitary.
 Just call next time, okay?
'Cause you're never late
 and it's a little weird.
 Is he always like this?
 Shaking with worry
like a little Chihuahua?
 What's happening?
 (chuckles)
Your daughter is
 just... fine.
 And, now, if you'll kindly
direct me to your restroom,
 I'd like to take a little
birdbath in your sink.
 That way.
 When did you start
palling around
 with an oyster peddler
in a vest?
 She did help me find out
that Evan was cheating on me.
 I think she comes
from a good place.
 She's going to the bathroom
with the door open.
 Oops! My bad!
(door shuts)
 (muffled): Forgot we were
in Beverly Hills.
 Mmm.
 Hey.
 What's going on?
Thanks
for coming by.
 Have a seat.
 Okay.
 How's your day so far?
 Well, I...
Listen, I got
some rough news,
 and I want to tell you
in person.
 I signed a lease
on a new apartment.
 I'm moving out.
That's great.
 Yes. For me. But things
have been so brutal for you.
 With your boyfriend
cheating on you.
 With your best friend.
In your own house.
 I just know that you-you felt
safe with Big Bro Brad here.
 The only time I was scared
was the night you screamed
 when you saw a bat.
 I wasn't screaming.
I was scrambling its sonar.
 (knocking)
Bat.
 Get the broom.
Hello!
 Oh.
(chuckles)
Hey, there you are.
 Hey there, Allison.
You know,
 I felt terrible about
forgetting my wallet
 today at our lunch,
so I wanted to come by,
 give you these flowers
to say thank you.
 Aw. That's so thoughtful.
 Oh. Wow. So, this is where
the magic doesn't happen.
 I get it. (chuckles)
Not anymore.
I'm moving out.
 Good for you. So,
you're escaping the, uh,
 vortex of celibacy.
 That's enough.
(chuckles)
 I don't take shots
at where you live.
 Where do
you live?
Just south of here.
 Gorgeous doorman building,
 (phone buzzes)
very hip, full of
beautiful people.
 Hey, you know what might help
the vibe in this place?
 One of those chairs shaped
like a giant hand.
 You know?
 And I think... yeah...
 it would
just fit through.
(phone chimes)
 Ooh. Do we have a match
on your dating app?
 Actually, yes.
Yes, we do.
 Yeah!
 And this one looks interesting.
 He works downtown.
He's a defense attorney.
 Sounds promising.
Swipe right for yes.
 Though, hold the phone--
 You are.
he likes
a late harvest Malbec. Mm.
 Could be a douche.
No, I'm out.
 Swiping left.
Though he loves reading.
 Mostly science fiction.
 Your sister just froze.
How do we reboot her?
 I got this.
 Dude, coaster.
 Wow. Well...
 what we have here is a
terminal case of overthinking.
 And the only cure?
A night of underthinking.
 You and I are going out tonight.
 I can't tonight. No, I have
cribbage with my dad.
 Oh, "I love cribbage" is
something no one has ever said.
 Go out with me to a
little club called...
 (whispers):
Aura.
 Aura? Yeah, we can't
get in there.
 I know the bouncer.
Yes, we will.
 Allison, go with your gut.
 What do you say to an
epic ladies' night out?
 Do it. Do it. Do it. It'll help
you take your mind off
me moving.
What?
 Oh, uh, yes! Yes.
Yes!
 No, I can't bail on my dad.
 Uh, it's already happening.
Go for Marv.
(phone chimes)
 (line ringing)
 Hey, sweetie.
Hi, uh, Dad.
 I've got some bad news.
I'm gonna have to
cancel tonight.
 I...
Go with your gut.
 I... It's my gut.
 I have leaky gut. Yes.
Wow, you're
terrible at this.
 That's 110% oyster-related.
I know.
 They just looked so good.
Yeah, I had one out on the deck
 by myself. Around 6:19.
 Wrap it up.
Okay, Dad, I got to... I got to
go. I'll see you at the office.
 And so the
night begins.
 All right, Allison, what are
you gonna wear out tonight?
 Don't think
about it. Go.
 The red jumpsuit
in the back of my closet.
 Yes!
No, I can't pull off
 a jumpsuit.
No one can.
 They're ridiculous.
They're like adult onesies.
 But the gut has spoken.
 Next, left-handed painkiller
or right-handed painkiller?
 Neither.
Suit yourself.
 Rock and roll!
 Okay. All right.
(whoops)
 Have my phone.
 (dance music blaring)
Vodka or tequila? Go!
 Vodka!
 (grunts, burps)
Oh! (whoops)
 Dance floor!
Okay!
 (both whooping)
 Yeah! Mm-hmm.
 All right, cowgirl, we
need to find you a man.
 What are you into?
Don't think about it. Go.
 Great ass! (chuckles)
I'm an ass girl. I had no idea.
 I'm on it. Now, do you want to
see a dating app in real life?
 You tell me, and I will
swipe right or left
 for you, okay? Trust
your gut. Let's go!
(whoops)
 No.
 Nope.
 Hey!
 Whoa. Hi.
 I'm Allison.
 Hi. I'm Doug. Have we met?
 Oh, my God. You're the guy I got
matched with on my dating app.
 What a bizarre coincidence!
 There's no such thing
as a coincidence.
 This is 100% pure,
uncut angel magic.
 Now, are we swiping
this guy right?
 Trust your gut.
What does it say?
 My gut's telling me
to dance with him.
 Well, then that is step one.
Step two is to kiss him.
 Because you will not be
certain until you do, okay?
 Okay. Hey.
 Hey. There was no answer
at your sister's.
 Uh, yeah, she went out with Amy.
 I knew she wasn't sick.
 She's a horrible liar.
 Yeah. She always uses
the time 6:19.
 Everybody's got their tells.
 It's like you
with the flop sweat.
 You going somewhere?
 Yeah, moving out.
 Got a new place.
 Really?
Yeah. It's incredible, Dad.
 Balcony, brand-new kitchen,
rooftop access
 to, like, a pool and spa.
 Ah. Sounds expensive.
 I know. You think it would be.
 But it's not.
No?
 It's just you said things
were kind of slow at work.
 No, work's good.
 I, uh, I sold seven houses
yesterday.
 Brad...
I messed up, Dad.
I messed up.
 I don't know what happened.
Amy was telling me
 about going with my gut
and the next thing I know,
 I'm signing a two-year lease.
Six months down.
 Amy's behind this?
 Who is this woman?
 I tried to Google her.
 Nothing.
 Google knows everything.
 I tell you,
it was so weird
 I called this cop
friend of mine, huh?
 Asked him to do
a background check.
 Maybe he's got something.
 (phone line ringing)
 Hello?
Jerry. Hey.
 Uh, anything on
that Amy character?
 JERRY:
Oh, yeah.
 Turns out that woman's
got quite a record.
 I knew it.
 They're all misdemeanors,
 and honestly I've never heard of
 most of these crimes before.
 Aggravated nudity.
 Impersonating a vehicle.
 Indecent shoplifting.
 That is a weird rap sheet.
 I did find
her current residence--
 it's a halfway house
over on Birchwood.
 She said she lived in
a beautiful doorman building.
 Anyway, I also found
 a video in her file.
 I just sent you the link.
 Great, we'll look at it now.
 What? You can't serve me?
 Why? I have a shirt
and shoes on.
 Whoa, I just saw
a rat back there.
 Oh, come on.
Oh.
 Whoa.
 (speaking indistinctly,
mouth full)
 Okay, yeah.
 I'd have to call that
indecent shoplifting.
 Thank you, Jerry.
 Thanks.
Thanks very much.
 All right, I'm gonna...
 I'm gonna try not
to freak out, here.
 (deep breathing)
It's...
hey, Dad, it's...

Yeah.

 Your daughter
is just fine.
 Big Bird stole my watch.
 Allison is with a criminal.
 Where'd they go?
 Aura...
Stop that.
 No, it's Aura.
It's a place called Aura.
 All right,
come on, let's go.
 Okay.
 (music blaring)
It's really good to be dancing.
 Last year, I got in
a pretty bad car accident.
 Oh, totally!
 What is up with the Kardashians?
 Sorry, if I could just, uh...
 My daughter, it's...
I'm so sorry.
 Actually, let me take
care of this, Dad.
 Okay.
What's up...
 Kevin. How's the
door tonight?
 I used to do
a little road-housing
 back in college, so...
 So Pops is
freaking out,
 His daughter's in there,
 he thinks she might be
in a little bit of trouble.
 I was hoping maybe
we could do a quick pop-in.
 Give it a little looky-loo?
 You're good.
 Appreciate the solid
from a fellow door dawg.
 No?
 Do you have change for a $50?
 Normally, I would tip $20--
that's fine.

 Shuck it.
 WOMAN:
Are you kidding me?
 Oh! Is this what you call
 "going out for formula"?
 It's... not what it looks like?
 Oh, my God. You're married?
 All right, this is all just
a big misunderstanding.
 Okay? Uh, no harm, no foul.
 She just kissed
my husband!
 Well, we all make mistakes.
 You brought a baby
into a nightclub, so...
 I am so, so sorry
about all of this.
 (screaming)
 Allison!
 Kev, we got a fight
on the floor!
 Hey, that baby
just took my choker.
 Uh... that's it.
 You've had your fun, baby.
 Now hand over
the choker,
 or I'm gonna make you wish
you were never Bjorn.
 (laughter)
 Rule number one for bouncers:
 you want to use humor
to defuse a crisis.
 Let's go.
I did get the formula,
it's in the...
 What the hell did you
get me into, Amy?
 Okay, what are you two
even doing here?
 Just thought
you might want to know
 your friend here,
the Jolly Blonde Giant,
 has a criminal record.
 Oh, tiny stuff.
 And most of it was when
I was young and in my 40s.
 Tell how you stole my watch.
 I did not steal your watch.
 And how you drunkenly
Pooh-Beared it all up
 inside of a donut shop.
 I did not steal your watch.
 Why don't you tell us about
 how you lied to us
about where you live.
 All right,
what the hell is going on?
 Allison, come on.
You know me.
 I know you said
you were my friend.
 But my friends don't lie to me.
 Okay, honey,
I want you to trust me,
 so why don't we all
go over to my place?
 You can see where I live,
learn all about me.
 I have no secrets.
 Give me another chance, okay?
 Okay.
 Last chance.
 Let's go.
Okay.
 We gonna get all cozy
and fit in one car?
 Santa's got
some room right here,
 if you've been
a good girl.
 (laughs)
I can't stop.
 All right, this is it.
 This is where I live.
 It's a supervised facility
 for people getting
back on their feet.
 I'm a live-in counselor here.
 Really?
Mm-hmm.
 So are you a counselor here
or are you a resident?
 I am a counselor,
 Allison,
 in residence.
 So this is
the doorman building?
 You may see a halfway house
with a security staff,
 but what I see is
a grand doorman building.
 And the people here
are beautiful.
 That's a great story.
 Counterpoint:
 here's my stolen watch.
 Case closed. Saddle up.
 Marv... listen.
 I felt bad that things
between the two of us
 got off on the wrong foot,
 so I had your watch fixed.
 Check it out.
 I was going to leave it
at your office tomorrow.
 (knock on doorframe)
Yeah.
 Ah. This must be your doorman,
 completing the Park Avenue vibe.
 No visitors
after 10:00 p.m.
 I'm marking you down
for this one, Amy.
 Oh...
We were just leaving.
 Allison...
Good night, Amy.
 (sighs)
  Et tu, Hot Pockets?
 We're not doing that anymore.
 I am sorry you're stuck
with this new apartment.
 I'm good.
 Brad...
 this place is
incredible!
 I know.
It's expensive.
 Hey, you guys moving in?
 Yes!
 Just me, though.
 Not her. Who is my sister.
 We aren't dating.
 No. Ever. Never were dating.
 I'm Brad. Single Brad.
 Hey, Single Brad.
I'm Katie.
 It'll be so nice to finally
have a man on this floor.
 This place is, like, all girls.
 I used to be a bouncer.
 KATIE:
That's great.
 See you around.
 Amy is a genius.
 Oh, really?
 Because one cute
girl lives here?
 No, no, no. I really think
our lives are getting better.
 Yours, yeah.
 I mean, you have
this brand-new apartment.
 It's great.
But how is Amy good for me?
 You got out of the house
last night.
 You had an amazing time.
 Before you kissed
a married man.
 Who had a wife.
Who had a baby.
 That kiss was disgusting,
by the way.
 It was weird.
 It was like it felt wrong
the second I did it.
 Exactly. Now you know
that guy's not right for you.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I guess would have stared
 at that guy's profile
for a whole week,
 not knowing
he was a married dirtbag.
 Amy.
 Good God,
I want this whole building
 to move in slow motion.
 Oh, Dad, gross,
you're... Dad.
I know, right?
 You can thank Amy,
by the way.
 She turned me
onto this place.
 Let's not speak
of the giant.
 I will say, however,
 it appears she
fixed my watch.
 She did fix it?
 (knocks twice)
 Hey.
Hey!
 She's back! Come on in.
 What's going on?
Are you moving?
 Yeah, seems like the next
 logical step
after being kicked out.
 Apparently,
having guests after hours
 brought on a lot
of scrutiny,
 even for counselors, so...
 I can't believe we got you
kicked out. I'm sorry.
 I should have told you
that I lived at a halfway house,
 but I've asked
your little human brain
 to process so much
in the last few weeks,
 I didn't think
you could handle it all.
 My little human brain?
 Yeah, as opposed
to the angel super computer
 I got goin' on right up here.
 (trilling)
You were right.
 I've been a little stuck
 and, uh, it felt really nice
 to make some decisions.
 But then, you know,
 you start talking
about being an angel
 and how you have this-this
computer inside your head
 and I'm just like, what the hell
am I doing with this woman?
 So...
 I am just going
to ask you:
 are you crazy?
 Does it matter?
 Yes!
 Hey!
Hey, sister.
 (laughs) Aw...
 I heard you're leaving.
Yes, I am.
 Are you bucking
for my mini-fridge?
No.
 I just wanted
to say thank you.
Oh...
 This woman
is a godsend.
 Aw, I'm really
happy for you.
 Call me anytime, okay?
Mm-hmm.
 My phone is always on.
Okay.
 Mute.
So leave a message.
 (laughs)
 Aw.
 Nice girl.
Lots of problems.
 Nose candy.
 Ah... shuck it.
 This is probably nuts,
 but, uh, hanging
out with you,
 strangely, seems
to be good for me.
 Brad's moving out of the garage,
 so do you want to crash
there for a while?
 Allison, wow.
 I would love to.
 But are you sure?
Have you thought about this?
 Not at all.
That's my girl.
Up top.
 (laughs)
 Why are you clapping?
I don't know.
 Going with my gut.
Feels good.
 I don't think
it's going to fit.
 Oh, it'll fit. Right there.
 Your new tenant has a box
 labeled "Loose Bones"...?
 That's for
a project, Marv.
 Oh, thanks for being here
on time this morning.
 (pats rear)
 I don't think her moving in
is a good idea.
 Dad, I know you've been worried
about me since the breakup,
 and I appreciate that,
 but I'm going to be okay.
 LAPD has a photograph of her
 riding her bicycle
on the Santa Monica freeway.
 In the carpool lane.
