 Now we will begin the public collaboration competition. The teams are divided into two, and each will give a 30-minute presentation. Afterward, the main design will be decided by a vote. We will begin with Jake Han's team presentation. Our motif is "the Duchess' wardrobe." The secretive lives of women amidst the orderliness of the Baroque Era. Their extravagant and glamorous charms were integrated into a firm shape and we added a touch of a classic flower pattern. The butterfly in this movie represents a dreamy, pure love. Much like a fantasy. However, the reality is not so romantic.

 Shoes are just a fantasy. But we wear those fantasies and fight in the cruel reality of life. So we have named this design, "romantic armor." Rather than wearing heavy armor to fight on life's battlefield, we need wings to fly freely like the butterfly. We will wrap up the presentations and go straight to the voting process. Isn't Ms. Hwang's design fabulous? I hope she wins the competition. I think our design is more elegant and classy. Technically, it's Jake's design. Sure, he's smiling on the outside, but he's probably dying on the inside. Win or lose, I have no regrets. I did my very best. We will tally the votes and make the announcement.

 Excuse me. Thank you for the flowers. I'm glad you liked them. They made an impression. It was very you. I'll have to return the favor. That's not necessary. You've already given me enough. Good luck with your design. I'll see you next week. - Thank you. - Sure. I will present the result. The selected work for the public collaboration is... Hwang Ji-an's design team. Thank you. This work was not done by myself. Mr. Park Tae-gang. This work was done in partnership with designer Park Tae-gang. Right? Careful. The baby. - Tae-gang. - Yes? You may leave if that's all. Yes, ma'am. Hello. May I help you? You've got a talent for surprising people. I'm here to apologize. For what? I ruined them. The sample. I ordered him to make it a mess. It was a temporary insanity in my desperation to win. I sincerely regret it. I'm sorry. Why are you confessing now? You could've played dumb. I wanted to concede my defeat. The moment I saw your shoes... They were mesmerizing. True. I've still got it. I agree, you still do. To show your repentance, will you stop stabbing me in the back? I don't know. Perhaps not intentionally, but I could do worse depending on the situation. I need to survive somehow. I hope you will let it slide like this whenever it does happen. You're capable of such generosity. Always watch your back. It was 23 to 16. It was a landslide! Really? We did it, didn't we? Congrats. We should celebrate. DIRECTOR HWANG JI-AN I have plans for this evening. I'm going to confess everything to Tae-gang tonight. It isn't like me to have avoided it for so long. Let's celebrate tomorrow. Okay, see you tomorrow. Right, the ring. DADSTER Hey, Dad. I heard you're proposing today. Crazy idiot. Sorry, Dad. Love you. Those... What? Tada. What's this? I borrowed it from Bong-soo. Does it even move? Let's take my car. Come on, let's go. Let's take my car. My car. Where are we going? It's going to be fine. - Do I have to get in? - Yes. Watch your head. What did Jake mean earlier? Why are you his? Oh, that. I think he might be gay. He's been giving me the eye ever since he landed. I know that's not the truth. Don't mind what he said. Anyway, about these shoes... Pretty good, huh? Not half bad, I guess. Wow, that's major praise coming from you. Please teach me even more. Anyway, where are you taking me in this car? You'll see. I'm going to confess everything to Tae-gang tonight. Hey, let's grab some drinks. Where are we going? CONGRATS When did you prepare this? What if we lost today? I knew we would win. Have a seat. You were awesome today. Congratulations. You, too. One, two, three. - Listen... - So... You first. No, you go first. All right. Look. No. I think you should go first. Unforgettable lady in the rain She's forever in my heart I cannot forget her beige trench coat Or her dark eyes With a warm smile I held A parasol over her head Watching the raindrops fall We walked silently in the rain Unforgettable lady in the rain She's forever I love you, Ji-an. My late grandmother gave this ring to my father. And he gave it to me. I've been wanting to give it to you for a while now. Let's get married. Marry me, Ji-an. I'll be Ankle's father. I'm confident I can be a good father to Ankle. This... is terrible timing for what I have to tell you. But I feel like it's now or never. You are... Ankle's father. What? You are... Ankle's father. I'm sorry. I didn't know how to tell you. Sorry. Hold on a second. We have a biological relationship. It's the same as receiving sperm from a sperm bank. He's an organism, not a man. He means nothing. He's as worthless as dust to me. Why did you... Since when? Wait, hold on. What have I been doing this whole time? I'm sorry. Sorry? All right, let's hear your excuse. Why did you hide it? I wasn't... trying to hide it... Let me guess. You got pregnant, and it had to be a guy who makes knockoffs. He has no house or money, and he never went to college. A loser who's only good at cleaning. You were ashamed. You couldn't dare take me out in public. I see, so that's why you named her Ankle. The ball and chain on your ankle. You're right, you gave me a ball and chain. Our one-night stand made me break up with the guy I was interested in. I was going to be president, but it slipped through my fingers. How could I tell you that I was pregnant with your baby? How could I say that? My life turned upside down. It took 180 degrees. I was half-crazed and terrified of the things to come. All the more reason to tell me. And if I did? Did you forget how we met? I didn't know your number, let alone your name. How could I tell you? I didn't know how you'd react. I considered telling you at first. I was so pissed off and felt cheated. It takes two to tango, so why should the woman suffer alone? But telling you would not change a thing. What if the doctor was the father? Would you still have hidden it? What? Maybe you would've jumped at the chance to marry him. Yes. I knew you wouldn't understand. It was so distressing for me. I agonized over whether or not to have an abortion. A kid like you... wouldn't understand. I should've guessed when you brought up adoption. It's guys like you that give decent guys like me a bad reputation. Annoying jerk. Whatever. Why are you obsessed with a pregnant woman? Do you think marriage is charity work like UNICEF or Red Cross? I'm not obsessed. She kicked me to the curb. Good for you. Listen, marriage is a grave and kids are the caretaker. Just live alone. Where are you? I should be drunk out of my mind, not you. The thing about graves... I mean, you have no idea... Hey, Je-hyeok. It's time for you to go home. Don't send me to the grave, Eun-sung. No, I want to sleep here. I don't want to go home. PUSHY PUNK Hello? Hey, Doc. Who's this? It's Dr. I'm-So-Cool. You know, I proposed to your girlfriend today and got the surprise of my life. The two of you must have been laughing at me all this time. "Look at that stupid kid. Who does he think he is?" Sorry, we lied to you. Sperm bank. An organism. Worthless as dust. That's me, right? Not you, but me. I thought you didn't care who the father was. You said you'd express your feelings. You said you didn't care that it was someone else's baby, and that you'd be true to your feelings. So what's with the pity act? How am I supposed to interpret this? Don't bother! I don't get you two either. Hi, Eun-sung. I was wondering how it went. Did you talk to him? Yes, it went well. I should've told him sooner. I was nervous for nothing. Really? Yes, he accepted it more easily than I expected. It's for the best. I can focus on Ankle now. All right then. Good night. The hell? Why do I have to go through this because of a piece of trash like you? You were never a man to me. If you have time to waste, read another line in a book and draw another design. You're right, you gave me a ball and chain. Our one-night stand made me break up with the guy I was interested in. I was going to be president, but it slipped through my fingers. I'll be Ankle's father. I'm confident I can be a good father to Ankle. You fool. Do you have no pride? Or do you just have a bad memory? Ankle. Where did things go wrong? Why have I become like this? This isn't what I wanted. This is not who I wanted to be. I didn't make you hangover soup. I wasn't in the mood to cook after cleaning your vomit all night. Have some milk instead. Lock the door behind you. Do you know... this is all your fault? Do you? This is your fault. Do you have any idea? So... About yesterday. Is it okay... if I keep working here? What do you mean? Won't you find it awkward to work with me? I can deal with it. You're lucky it's so easy for you to keep your work and personal life apart. But do you know what? The awkwardness is already suffocating me. - Do you want to switch departments? - It's fine. It's my future. I'll handle it myself. Door closing. Dad. You little... Come with me. Were you with her all night? No. Like hell you weren't, you crazy fool! I'm not getting married. Happy? Did she reject you? This is what you wanted. I'm going to the States. Really? You'll go? I'm going to study and work my butt off. I'll come back as a more famous designer than Ji-an. Wait and see. Fool, no one said you have to be famous. That's the standard. I have to succeed. I have to prove myself. That's how someone like me becomes qualified enough. I'm going to succeed even if it kills me. What in the world did she say to him? We discussed our future marketing strategy with Hilda. We decided to put Ms. Yeom Na-ri in charge. Pardon? You did good work, Ms. Hwang. But soon you won't be physically fit to... I'm fine. You'll have to deal with the media more, too. If we consider our public image... What about it? Is there something wrong with me? We're not here to talk about principles. The shareholders are worried, and so is Hilda, for that matter. This is what the chairman wants. How could you do this to me? We're not liberal here like in the States. Our target market is Asia. Hilda agrees that we have to meet the social norm in Asia. Fine then. I will withdraw from the collaboration. You can use Jake's design. Ms. Hwang. You're basically telling me that you're ashamed I'm a single mother. So I should stay out the spotlight and work hard behind the scenes. I'm not at this company to do volunteer work. You didn't design the shoes on your own. You said so yourself yesterday that you co-designed it with Park Tae-gang. Ms. Hwang. You must have seen this coming. I told you, this is the harsh reality of our industry. They're right, this is the reality. DIRECTOR HWANG JI-AN This is my reality. Come in. I need your approval. Ms. Ma. Yes? Did I hurt your feelings at all when you were pregnant? Pardon? That was so many years ago. So I did. I hope you understand that I was clueless back then. I've already forgotten it. You helped me improve as a designer more than anything. Ma'am. Yes? May I be out of line and give you some advice? Go ahead. I know things are hard right now. And they will get harder after the baby comes. I didn't choose to grit my teeth and work harder. I learned to give up some things, and that made life easier. I started relying on other people. I'll keep that in mind. My apologies. Why did you change your mind? You were determined not to go. For someone like me, this is the fastest road to success. I'm sorry it took me so long. Did Ms. Hwang tell you to go? Did she insist that you go? No, it was my decision. When can I leave? The sooner the better. Are you running away after being dumped? I have more important priorities than love. Like I mentioned, I want to succeed and fast. All right, I'll talk to Jake. Thank you. And sorry about the other day. Thank you for your support. Mr. Park, we're from the company newsletter. Come again? I heard you played a huge part in the collaboration design. No, I was just the assistant. Ms. Hwang did everything. And you're very humble. It's not like that. I just made the ribbon... So the focal design, the ribbon, was entirely your idea? I told you, no. I heard Jake Han tried to recruit you recently. He did. So it's true. Ms. Yeom has nothing but praises for you, that you're a great talent worthy of the company paying for your study abroad. I discovered a talented designer. He's got a good eye, good spirit, and is good-looking. I have my eye on him. I could make him into a star designer. Right? Come in. The final report on the collaboration. Jake made you an offer? Why didn't you tell me? Since when do we share secrets with each other? We're all about keeping secrets. When are you leaving? Next week, at the earliest. Definitely within the month. That's great. It is. Study hard and become a good designer. Although I'm not sure we'll ever get to work together. I'll send child support. After all that talk about responsibility, I can't be a hypocrite now. But I can't send a lot. I'll send what I can. My car feels particularly smooth today. Are you thrilled that I'm leaving? Nonsense. I'm already feeling lonely. - Thanks, Jake. - Sure. We lost the competition. It doesn't matter. I got the result I wanted. Sorry I wasn't much help. All I did was end up helping Tae-gang. That's good enough. I know why you're in a good mood. You're happy that Tae-gang agreed to go abroad. Ridiculous. You like him, don't you? I do not. I appreciate his talent, that's all. Yeah? All right then. I'm going to work him to the bone. And hook him up with pretty girls. Don't you dare. Gotcha. Make him great. I'll be waiting. I'm considering striking up an alliance with Jake's company. With long-term investors to start an institute that specializes in shoes. That's a good idea. I'm planning to use Park Tae-gang for publicity. Isn't he only a high school graduate? And from a poor economic background. His father used to make imitation shoes in Itaewon. Dramatic story, isn't it? Like a male Cinderella. You even thought of that? You're a regular businesswoman now. Come in. Mr. Park is here. He came all the way here? My goodness, can't I eat in peace? Continue without me. I'm going to talk to Mr. Park. Let's go. You're in a good mood. This is the first time I've spent time with him since I came to Korea. What are you going to do about Ji-an? I'll keep her for now. She still has some worth. And no one else is as experienced. I've heard this story before. A designer ruining her career because of a child out of wedlock. But at least your mother was smart about it. Ms. Hwang was once your rival. No point in keeping her close. There are other talented people out there. Get rid of her before you become president. We were commended by the Ministry of Gender Equality. She just declared single motherhood. If we kick her out without justification, it would harm our image. Please give me some time until I have a good reason. Make one up. Okay. Unforgettable lady in the rain She's forever in my heart Why so serious? Hi. Your dark circles are reaching for your chin. Is something wrong? I'm just tired. You should nip prenatal depression in the bud. It's not depression. I'll prescribe something. A little medication won't hurt. I'm fine. Then shall I cheer you up? A prolonged depressed mood is bad for the baby. If someone tough like you is depressed, it must be really serious. How about a movie? Or a play? A concert? An exhibit? Why are you staring? You think I'm amazing, right? Naturally. I have my pride. The same woman rejected me three times. Or was it four? The first two times, then that one time... Woman, how many times did you reject me? You're embarrassing me. So, back to square one. Let's be friends. Where will you live in the States? In a penthouse like in the movies? At the school dorm. Since America's so rich, I'm sure their dorms are amazing. Will it be next to the women's dorms? I don't know. Would it be co-ed? What did you guys decide to do? He's going to America. He was offered a deal. America? It's for the best. It's not like we were going to live together. If we meet again someday, and we've both become successful, that would be nice. Do you know why I like you, Ji-an? You're like a missile that charges forward. Straight and without hesitation. You're so simple, that you write "yes" in a text without a period. But you lack guts when it comes to one thing. Know what that is? This right here. You pretend to be okay and unaffected. Stop pretending. Let your feelings be as straightforward as your actions. That's not very adult-like. Who says we're adults? No matter how old we get, we're still immature and clueless. We still have tons to learn and we make mistakes. There are no adults. Just wrinkled children. So... let me ask you again. Little girl Ji-an, how do you feel? I feel... like... crap. I'm going to believe what I saw and felt, not your words. Let your feelings be as straightforward as your actions. I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY I'm coming over. We need to talk. So... Yeah? Well... Why did you tell me? What made you decide to tell me? I don't know. You don't know? I don't. I began wanting to tell you every time I saw your face. But you have no intention of marrying me. - Right. - And in the future? I can't make any promises. Why not? Because... you're a reckless and immature child. But you still wanted to tell me. I did. You don't intend to marry me or anything. You think I'm reckless and childish. You don't think, and you rush into things. And? Everything you do is childish. You don't have a serious bone in your body. Yet... I wanted to tell you. Why? I told you, I don't know. You honestly don't know? I have a pretty good idea why. Being pregnant hasn't killed her Medusa-temper at all! What if Ankle gets her temper? Couldn't you graciously let bygones be bygones, and look to the future? Did he decide to go? Will he leave her and the baby? How is my life different now from when I made knock-offs? My life itself is a knock-off. How could she suggest... Come work for us. Subtitle translation by Jeong Lee
