 EPISODE 6 {\an8}What's the problem? Actually, I found a sonogram in your car. It's like a small cyst. They say it'll be a simple surgery to remove it. Want to see? This is them at eight weeks. Do you know this is all your fault? Do you? This is your fault. Do you have any idea? Everything is your fault!

 It's all your fault! Responsibility? What can you do? Eight weeks. Right before we met? I'm sorry. For what? For being pregnant? Or for telling me that you're pregnant? Good for you and your honesty. I know. I made a stupid mistake and I'm paying for it dearly. So? Should I continue blaming myself? How would that help? What do you plan to do?

 I don't know. I'm not sure. I went to the hospital to get an abortion, but suddenly it seemed unfair. Why did it have to be in me, just to be treated like a cyst and be killed? Suddenly, I couldn't tell whether I'm the victim or the criminal. Are you asking for a consultation? Why? Do you expect me to give you encouragement? You're right. We... only met... on a blind date anyway. I'll come up with an excuse to our parents. I can only do that much for you. And I bought this for you. You can keep it or not. Hello. About your design. I tried my hardest to find it. I reported it to the police. And I just came back from handing out fliers. Please... get lost. I'm sure it was a baby sonogram. I'm sure it's some other guy's. Come on! Her personality would chase away other guys. Maybe perverts. You know, the kind that likes pain. Masochists? That's it. Besides, she eats chocolate and candy instead of a real meal to save time. She has no time to date. I'm 95% sure. No, 99% sure. What do I tell my dad? I can't believe this. I suggest immigration. I'll loan you what I can. You can go to one of those cheap countries. Tibet or Mongolia. Or there's Africa. No, wait, you should go where no one will ever find you. The Amazon or the South Pole. You call that a plan? What will you do if she wants marriage? Will you marry that witch just because of one drunken mistake in your life? You've got the looks and the charm. And now you work for a big company. If you go to a club now, the girls will line up for miles. Will you throw that away? Don't give up on your life so easily. We have to go out and have fun. I'm glad to see you're together. Come with me. Why? Someone left behind a couch when they moved out. It's really good leather. And it's a hefty size. I could easily create ten boots from it. We have to nab it before someone else does. All right, we'll be right there. Hurry up, kid. Jeez. Don't say a word to him. You have to tell him. You can't handle this alone. I haven't confirmed it yet, so keep your mouth shut. Tell him and you're dead, you hear me? All right. Goodness, I feel like we're taking advantage of your kindness. When we're settled in our new home, I'll create super Class A shoes for you. I've never worn designer shoes before. Tell me if you want anything else. Thank you. You do realize your son works at a shoe company. Brat. Don't worry, I won't copy from your company. Let's eat. What? I have no appetite. Well, if that isn't the sound of a starfish having brain farts. You have to eat even if you don't feel like it. From here on out, we have to tighten our belts. We have to make money and pay back the loan. Then, open a savings account for your wedding fund. Dad. What if I marry early? That would be great. It would be easier if we there's someone to do the house chores. To have dwenjang ready when we come home from work. And when she brings in the drinks, you and I would drink up together. Father, Sweetie, time for dinner. Hurry. That's like expecting a rooster to lay an egg. Oh, hot! Hey! Wipe the floor! Okay. Why do you keep crying? Hush, don't cry. Mommy's working. Quiet. Gosh, darn it! What's your problem? Are we your slaves? Your nanny? What has gotten into you? From now on, you will look after the baby, cook, and clean the house. Then cook dwenjang soup and prepare some drinks! Are you drunk? You're stupidly courageous right now. What are you doing? I'm your husband. So what? You know what happens if you disrespect your husband, don't you? What happens? Do tell. Or shall I teach you? The deadline for the final design production is fast approaching. Ms. Hilda J. Fried herself will be participating as a judge. The winner's design will be the collaboration's main look. It will be released in 24 countries, including Korea. It's going to be a great opportunity for a designer. I expect the best from all of you. Enough. Next. Ma'am. Have you been working late these days? Yes, well... See that? Even a veteran designer like Ms. Hwang has to work her butt off for this project. I'll be looking forward to it. Yes, ma'am. Ms. Hwang, would you like some coffee? Yes, an espresso. Sure. Actually, I'll have milk. White milk. Okay. She's very stubborn. She makes us work too much. Is it still not enough? What movie is she going to watch tonight? Let her. Maybe she's creating a movie about her life's masterpiece. SECRET RENDEZVOUS NEEDED Symptoms during the early stage of pregnancy. First. Everyone knows about morning sickness, so we'll pass on that. She'll start feeling tired throughout the day. SENSE OF SMELL Her sense of smell will become sensitive. In other words, she'll have a weak stomach. And an increase in bathroom trips because their uterus is putting pressure on their bladder. On top of that, major mood swings. And constipation. POO As for food. Food? She'll want food she usually doesn't eat. For example, my wife and hamburgers. Jokbal? Forget it, I can't eat things like that. So who's pregnant? They didn't move out yet? Anyone home? Who is it? Hello, it's Park Kwang-seok. I'm here to wallpaper the place. Hold on. Who? Park Kwang-seok. I'm moving in tomorrow. Where's the owner of the house? I'm the owner. Pardon? Mr. Park... How could he... You've been neighbors for years. How could he scam you of all people? I can't believe how brutal people can be. We should tell Tae-gang. I'll call him. What are you doing? We have to tell him. I'll handle it. Don't say a word to him, do you hear me? But we should... No ifs, ands, or buts. The day you tell Tae-gang is the day you die, got that? Yes, sir. I still think we should tell him. If he finds out... I told you not to tell him! Get it through your thick skull! Yes, sir. I won't tell him. Do the 24 countries include countries in South America and Africa? Do people in Africa wear heels? That's not important. Hilda's main model is Scarlett Johansson. Scarlett Johansson wearing my heels? That sounds so awesome! I'm going to make it sexy with Swarovski crystals and gold straps. {\an8}BONDONG PRESCHOOL ME, AUNTIE, HAMTORY You want out of the collaboration? Actually... If it's about your kid, I don't want to hear it. Ms. Hwang. Don't you realize what this opportunity means? Other people wouldn't say no to this. As a manager, don't you want this? Didn't you study abroad for this opportunity? Of course, I want this. I'm a designer too. My design could be sold worldwide through a luxury brand. Do you think I want to clean up after the others and check up on the factories? But an opportunity like this could come again. But I don't get to be a mother twice. I mean, my son drew a family portrait without my husband or me. He even drew his pet hamster. The hamster means more to him than I do. - I'm okay. - Come on. You cleared your evening schedule, right? Yes, but why are we here? You'll be making more public appearances soon. We need to change your style. I'm okay with... Running a company isn't just about doing good work. You have to create an image. What you wear, what you eat, and who you meet. Your every move is an extension of your job. How about this? Try it on. Good evening. I'm here for a fitting... Mother, I didn't expect to see you here. Do you shop here? Of course. You're a regular here. This is great. You could help me pick out... I'm not used to this style... Ms. Hwang is here too. Goodness, you look elegant. You look like a completely different person. Turn around. Sorry? That looks great. What do you think? It looks good on her. We'll use the media before the official announcement. I've set up a few interviews from the press and women's organizations next week. Make time for them. - Madam. - Yes? Could you allow me some time to think it over? What are you saying? I haven't decided yet. My personal affairs are a little complicated right now. Why? Does it bother you to jump past the vice president to become the president? Not exactly... This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Do you want to remain as just an employee or open a new life experience? Everything depends on this opportunity. Becoming president should be the only thing on your mind. Remove everything else from your thoughts. Ms. Kim. Good night. Are you okay? Yes. Director Hwang. Oh no. No. President Hwang. You'll become the best. Why? Because I chose you. Good night. Get home safely, Madam. Are you stalking me now? I thought you said kissing up to people wasn't your style? You told me to stop backstabbing, and fight you fair and square. Or did you forget? I'm exhausted today. Would you please get to the point? You're a dirty hypocrite. I know your kind all too well. You put up this front of being noble and righteous, but underneath, you're despicable and a cheater. Is this about the clothes that Madam Jang bought for me? Listen to me carefully. When I become president, you'll be the first to go. I'll get you blacklisted in the industry, and you'll never work again. If you want to survive, you'd better pull out all the stops to beat me. I plan to do whatever it takes. Gosh... What a tiring lives we all lead. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Do you want to remain as just an employee or open a new life experience? Everything depends on this opportunity. Becoming president should be the only thing on your mind. Remove everything else from your thoughts. It's just a benign tumor. It's like a small cyst. They say it'll be a simple surgery to remove it. I'll have milk. White milk. Will she keep the baby or not? Are you still thinking about that? If she's still being quiet about that, she probably had the abortion already. No way. Shouldn't you be grateful if she does? All your problems will be solved. You punk. What? How can you say that? I was a mistake too, but my dad said he never once regretted having me. Your parents only got married because of you too. Then marry the woman. Go ahead, live under Medusa's thumb and live happily ever after. Why you... Oh no! What? This... What is it? Medusa! Why is she calling so late? How would I know? Hey, don't answer it. If I don't, then what should I do? You answer it and say I'm not here. Are you crazy? You know I have a weak heart. Hello? Sorry? Yes. Okay. Bye. What? Is the baby yours? Does she want you to man up? She wants jokbal. Jokbal? Don't ask her. Wait for her to talk about it. Hey, even if she says it's your baby, deny it unless she asks for a paternity test. Don't worry, I'll handle it. Hey, do you have anything to calm my nerves? Come in. Okay. Sit. Okay. Here, jokbal. Usually guys do this for me. Right. Aren't you going to eat? Sorry? No, I'm fine. Why did you call at this hour? It couldn't be because you really wanted jokbal. Did you find my design? You said it was okay. I changed my mind. Find it. What? You said you'd take responsibility. Find it no matter what. All right, I'll look for it again. You're my slave until you do. You'll come and go when I say, and you'll quit your job if I want. But... Especially jokbal. Deliver them within 15 minutes whenever I want them. Why don't you just tell me? You clearly called me over because you have something to say. Stop talking nonsense and give it to me straight. You're right. I do have something to say to you. What is it? Once I tell you, you'll regret asking. I won't, so tell me now. Never mind. What the heck? Why not? I called you because I was craving jokbal. That's all. You're driving me nuts. How could you do this? You called me at this hour. You should follow up with the original plan. Whatever, tell me what it is. Now. Just let it out! I have nothing to say. Yes, you do! Do you know something? I... I'm just really curious. I really was craving jokbal. That's why I called. So, you may go. Go. You're driving me crazy. Listen. You won't regret this, right? This is your last chance to tell me. I'm really leaving! Jeez! Whatever. Look, just spill it... What are you doing? Isn't it obvious? This helps the time pass when I'm upset. Why are you still here? What the... Aren't you going to leave? Hand it over. You'll never finish cleaning if you're working that slow. So you are good at something. I'm better at more things than you. You're practically a master at it. This is nothing compared to my father. Your father? Yes, he worked in the industry for a short time. That's right. I have something to ask you. What? I saw some kids' shoes here the other day. These? Yeah. What are they? My very first work. I see. I was in the first grade. Wow, it was so long ago. I was passing by the stationery store one day, and the white indoor shoes looked so colorless and pitiful hanging there. I thought the shoes would like to be decorated with ribbons and colors. That was the start. These shoes gave me my dream. They're too valuable to put a price on them. So why shoes, of all things? Of all things? Why not clothes, bags, jewelry, or watches? Why something at the very bottom? Do I need a reason to like it? I don't understand. Shoes aren't as visible as clothes. They're not comfortable either. And they don't have property value like watches or jewelry. Do you know the saying, "Nice shoes take you to nice places"? Isn't that a line from a movie? At first I thought it meant pretty shoes bring good luck. But I was wrong. Shoes cast a magic spell on me. They make me brave. They make me believe that I'm the best. So they allow me to do what my heart dictates. They take me to places where I want to go. That's the best place to be. Hey! You... But... It wasn't me. Dang it. Jokbal! And she tried to frame me? Mr. Han lost big in the stock market and owed billions of wons to loan sharks. I think he planned it from the start. That jerk. That wasn't just any money. I have to get it back. I won't come back until I do. Finally, all done. Where did she go? I'm done. She falls asleep anywhere. She's pretty. Oh, jeez. Can't cook, can't clean. Doesn't know how to recycle. How is she going to raise a baby? Mom, is that you? Your fridge was empty, so I had to cook with what I got from the convenience store. Hope you have a hot weekend. Is he a good cook? Let's see. That's so spicy. What did he put in here? I like peppers, so he put one in whole? "Hot weekend." Seriously, Tae-gang. Jeez. What brings you here? I was in the neighborhood. - Hey... - Hey... You first. I didn't go to the clinic. I know. What are you thinking... Don't start with me. You know I have no one else on my side. Seriously... Here. What's this? These are the shoes I wanted! - Sorry about before. - Friends don't say sorry. Hey, isn't this the color that's trendy right now? I'm so excited. How about a kiss? You guys are picky about the same food. Min-ju, show Auntie. Tada! Tada! She copies me even if I don't teach her. She's a little genius. Min-ju, here I come! I almost have you! Gotcha! Give Mommy a kiss. Gross. What's gross? What? What's gross? Hey! Where are you going? Mommy, catch me if you can! What? I'm going to get you! So you want to play, do you? Here I come! - Catch me if you can! - Here I come! Thanks. Did you decide to keep the baby? I haven't yet. I just think there has to be a reason why I'm hesitating. I'm putting it on hold until I find out why. You're the most decisive person I've ever known. How did this happen? I know, right? I always thought that my life was predetermined. But a path I never expected has popped up out of nowhere. Can you even imagine me having a baby and raising it? What? Do you think other moms are born to be moms? I had to fight for custody over Min-ju, remember? You know I zone out if I read anything beyond ten lines. But I went through those law books like they were nothing. I could've taken the bar exam. That's what being a mom means. Making the impossible possible. It's going to be a million times harder and more terrible than you imagine. But you'll also be a million times happier. It makes Jun-hui read law books and Ms. Ma give up an opportunity as a designer. What is it? What's waiting down this path? I'll never find out if I don't take that path, right? I'm as confused and scared as ever. But I'm starting to grow a little... just a little... curious. I'M CURIOUS. Hey, now. You shouldn't carry such heavy things. Good morning. What the heck? - Did you have a nice weekend? - Yeah. I must have overworked. My body's aching all over. Stop exaggerating. I absolutely hate it when people touch my stuff. And was that kimchi stew or pepper stew? It almost gave me an ulcer. Oh no, spicy food! Is that a no-no? It wasn't half-bad. Right? I cook really good stew, if I do say so myself. - Are you free this evening? - Why? I have something to ask you. I'm having dinner with my parents. I see. I'll be done by nine p.m. Call me when you get to my place. I'm shifting around responsibilities. Ms. Uhm, you manage the patterns. Sorry? That's Ms. Ma's job... My arm's tired. Mr. Song, the Seongnam factory. Ms. Jin, the year-end taxes. Da-in, help Ms. Ma with the international orders... Ms. Hwang, we're crazy busy with the collaboration... Are you the only ones working? You can't do only fun things when in an organization. We have to help each other out, don't you agree? Yes, ma'am. And Ms. Ma? Yes, ma'am. No more excuses. You'd better submit a design. What should I do? You? You should clean. Clean. Where do I start? A fetus is a life, and not an object. "Why is the government interfering in my decision?" That's like treating the fetus as a handbag. No one is calling the fetus a handbag. This is a life-altering decision. The government should respect that. Everyone should have the right to control their life and pursue happiness. I've never met a woman who was happy after an abortion. But I did see plenty who were happy after giving birth. It's easy for you to say since it's not your life. What if it were your daughter or your sister? Would you be saying the same? What I'm trying to say is... Seriously... We cannot. We can't tell them to have an abortion or to keep the baby. We don't have the right to decide that. The same goes for the baby. The babies can't tell you that if they want to live or if they're in pain. They can't resent you for having to die because of your mistakes. Put yourself in their shoes. Would you offer to die for your mother's happiness? Aren't you being too emotional about this? That's what I would do. If aborting me would make my parent's life happier, I wouldn't beg for my life. Dr. Cho. Where are you going? Hey! - I'm sorry. - For what? For being pregnant? Or for telling me that you're pregnant? I know. I made a stupid mistake, and I'm paying for it dearly. I went to the hospital to get an abortion, but suddenly it seemed unfair. Why did it have to be in me, just to be treated like a cyst and be killed? Mom? Today? You're going to go? What will you say to her? I'm just going to ask her. Why are you all dressed up if that's all you're going to ask? You look like you're going to propose. Dude, stop exaggerating. I'm just going to ask her whether or not it's my baby. And what if it is your baby? Then I'll take responsibility. What? I thought it over, and marrying early isn't such a bad idea. A man needs a stable family life if he wants to do great things. Hey. Do you really like this woman? Jeez, are you crazy? Tae-gang, what's gotten into you? Snap out of it. Did the witch cast some kind of spell on you? Snap out of it. Wake up! Look, I don't like her. I'm just a little curious, that's all. That means you like her, fool. You'll start wondering about her hobbies and her favorite foods. The music she likes and her dreams at night. That's the start of it all. Falling slowly is more dangerous than love at first sight. You know this, yet you always get dumped, huh? - Hey. - Oh, goodness. I'm telling you so you don't end up like me. This is really getting serious. Are you here to have dinner? Yes. Wait. May I get your address? The necklace. I didn't get the chance to return it. I don't think I should accept it. Then throw it away. Throw it away yourself. Why are you making me do it? Why? You don't like throwing things away? I figured that was your specialty. I'll send it to the hospital. Hello, Father. Hi. These are Eun-sung's parents. Say hello. I'm here... You must be upset to marry off such a precious daughter. No, of course not. I feel like I can finally sleep in peace. I can tell you raised your daughter well by just looking at her. You flatter us. You raised your son to be a fine young man. Perhaps it's because I only have one daughter, but Eun-sung makes me feel like I've gained the world. No, it's our honor to have such a great daughter-in-law. My apologies, but we're... Ji-an. Excuse us. We're going to step outside to talk. It won't take long. - How about another glass? - Sounds good. Why did you stop me? Someone has to do what you clearly failed to do. I was going to tell them tonight. Whatever, let's settle things now instead of putting it off. No. I'll take care of it. Why do you do as you please? What makes you so great? Why are you so self-righteous? Do you have any idea what my life has been like since that day? Why did you have to confide in me? You should've just had the abortion in secret. You knew I was an OBGYN doctor. How did you expect me to feel around you after hearing that? How... How can I continue liking you? You're... the absolute worst. It would be weirder for a successful woman her age not to have a guy. I don't know either! I can't marry her. Yes. I've been saved. What's up between you two? Me and Ms. Hwang? Let me see. She's in my spam list. I'm not in the mood for your games. You were right. It's the other guy. Subtitle translation by Jeong Lee
