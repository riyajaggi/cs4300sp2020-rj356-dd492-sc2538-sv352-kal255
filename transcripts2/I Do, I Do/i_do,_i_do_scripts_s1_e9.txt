 EPISODE 9 My bag. Here. Bye. Hold on. Why didn't you let me drink earlier? And at the company dinner, too. Oh, that? It looked like you didn't want to. Earlier, in my office. That thing... you saw... Ji-an.

 Do you realize how late it is? I was worried sick. Why were you waiting? I came back with medicine, and you went missing. Your phone was in your office, and your car was in the parking lot. You've been waiting here all this time? I was ready to report you missing. I even almost called your parents to ask if you were there. I'm sorry. I forced her to come with me when she didn't want to. Why are you apologizing? Thank you for worrying, but I don't get why you're mad. All that matters is you and what you decide, right? Can't you understand how worried sick I was? It's not that I don't...

 Enough. You shouldn't fight over something so insignificant with the person you love. It's just a waste of emotions. Just hold hands and talk things out. Think of the baby. I should get going. See you tomorrow, ma'am. Wait. Hold on. Did he just... He knows about the baby? Wait. He thinks I'm the father? That's crazy. Well, he does seem to know I'm pregnant somehow. He probably misunderstood and is apparently mistaken. Sorry. And suddenly I'm a father. I'm really sorry. I'll clear things up with him tomorrow. Why are you laughing? Then should I cry? I can see why he misunderstood. I'll explain it to him tomorrow. - It's fine. - It's not fine with me. Here, take this. Medicine for anemia and caffeine-free headache medicine. Don't forget to take them. Bye. You're still here. I'm sorry for causing you so much concern. You didn't do it on purpose. But you shouldn't have made her cry at the office. You seem awfully interested in our personal lives. It's not necessary, really. I can't stand it when men make women cry, that's all. What's your name? Park Tae-gang. Age? Twenty... That's none of your business. How about a formal introduction? I'm Cho Eun-sung. I know. The doctor. Wow. That's quite a handshake. Really? I didn't even try. It's not some big secret. I shouldn't let it bother me. It was bound to get out anyway. I'll explain things to him tomorrow. What? The baby is mine? But I'm not interested in marriage... I knew it. We're totally fated to be together. - Don't worry. - Stop it. I'll take care of everything. Everything? What the... What the heck? We're family, so we should live together. Whose family? My daughter-in-law! Sweetie, weren't you lonely all on your own? Well, we're here for you now. What are you people doing? Sit down. Tae-gang and I will take care of everything from now on. Take care of what exactly? Which one's my room? The biggest one, of course. Come with me. Really? This room, Dad. Hey! Wow, look at the shoes! Wow. These are really pretty. And they're all ours, Dad! Ours? All of them? Let me see. I could sell these when I'll need some spending money. They'll sell for a pretty penny. - Really? - Yup. We've hit the jackpot, kid. I did it! My son is the best! Why aren't you in bed? What? Your father asked me if you still like her. And? I told him, no way. Good. Snap out of it, kid. She's carrying another guy's baby. You'll get really hurt. I'm over it. You can't do this to your father. I said I'm over it! So... I found out recently. From the sonogram in your car. I didn't know what it was until I realized it looked just like Bong-soo's. I didn't tell anyone else, not even Bong-soo. Thanks. But you'll start showing soon. How long will you hide it? Until after the collaboration. I see. It must be convenient since the father's an OBGYN doctor. Yes, it is. Regardless, please don't tell anyone for now. No problem. So are we starting the Spartan training today? Yeah. FOOT AND ANKLE Memorize it. Every last word. I'm going to test you. And draw 100 basic sketches a day. One hundred? Work at the call center in the morning and research complaints and reviews. How can I do all of that at once? You said you'd do anything. You like doing things with a bang. Work hard and show everyone. To the people who snubbed you and called you a loser. Show everyone who mistreated you, including me, what you're made of exactly. All right, I'll give it a shot. Shots should stay in the hospital. I'll do it! But you have to promise me that you'll make me into a proper designer in a month. What? You went to Medusa and not to Ms. Yeom? I was going to tell you yesterday, but I forgot... Bong-soo. I thought I was going to be transferred to the Design team, thanks to you. So I drank and called my boss a "bald eagle." What? Why did you do that? Right? Why did I? I want a refund. The pork you ate last night cost 108,500 won! You're so clueless. This is all part of my master plan. Master plan? This is absolutely a top secret. I am being secretly trained by Ms. Hwang. FOOT AND ANKLE See this? Trained? Right. She chose me to follow in her footsteps. In other words, her protege. But why you? Jeez. Don't you have any faith in Ms. Hwang's judgment? I do. I have faith. Give me one month, tops. I'll crush the other designers, okay? Just one month, right? DIRECTOR HWANG JI-AN Hello? Can you talk? Go ahead. About... the misunderstanding. Yes. Did you explain things to him? Well... Don't tell me you didn't. Give me time until the collaboration ends. I have a lot going on right now. Sure. Thanks. You're welcome. What do I get from you in return? Well... So... I want a car. Sorry? A car? I've been wanting a camper van. The kind in the movies. Furnished with a bar and a bathtub. You're kidding, right? Not at all. Anyway, I'll think about it. You might have to dip into your savings. "The tarsal bone." Cut out or wrap around. The tarsal bone... "Chapter one, the lower framework. The foot has 28 bones and 41 ligaments. As well as 20 different muscles. The bones can be..." Why am I stuck on this? Forgive me, Madam Jang. That's better. Here's my homework. You managed to finish on time. These are nice, clean lines. Praise is in order. For Seol Bong-soo. What do you take my eyes for? A chewed gum stuck on the sole of a shoe? Actually, I didn't ask for his help. He insisted to do it. Do the whole thing over. And 100 more. Now for a pop quiz. What? You didn't mention one. Question one. Name a type of foot arch. Foot arch? Question two. The three types of arches. Question three, how many bones are there in a toe's joints? Not bad. I guess your father isn't all that stupid. Are you guys... going on a picnic? We're going out to find inspiration. Work like you're playing. That's my philosophy. Lucky you. We'll be going to a flower exhibit and walk around Samcheong. Do you want to join us? No, thanks. Then answer the phones for us. Let's go. What? Nothing. See you later. Good afternoon. Where is everyone going? Get ready. We're going out, too. You said we were going on a picnic, but we're just across the office. What's wrong with that? I understand you don't get out much. Find us a good spot. Over there! Here. When did you prepare this? Do you not wear killer heels anymore? My doctor said no. I see. So, I'm trying to find the right height. After all, everyone at the office is watching. I'm drawing very diligently, like you said, but I don't understand. Why do women wear heels? If they want to appear taller, they can wear platforms or use insoles. Why balance their bodies on something that's thin as a chopstick? Finally, some progress. In the ten years working for your father, did you ever bother to ask why? Nope. That's true. Wow, am I finally joining the big league? You wish. You've barely learned your ABCs. Yes, ma'am. The foot has 28 bones and 41 ligaments. As well as 20 different muscles. The bones can be divided into three categories... Ankle, whose foot will you take after? What? - Cherry, I mean... - What? What? There was a bug. A bug? Where? It's gone. - It's gone? - Yes. What's with you? What great weather. Jokbal for lunch? Were you craving it? I know, right? Strangely, this is the only thing I crave. But why is it taking so long? CHO EUN-SUNG Hi, Eun-sung. I was planning on calling you. Yes. Okay, bye. Look, something came up and I have to go. Lunch is on me. Take your time, okay? Sure, go ahead. - Goodbye. - Thank you. Enjoy the food. What's the big hurry? I thought of a wish. Which is? A new doctor for you. Again? We have a really talented doctor who enjoys tackling challenges. He wants to take your case. That's your wish? I'll go get your new doctor. Come in. Nice to meet you. I'm the courageous Dr. Cho Eun-sung. I'll be your doctor from now on. What are you doing right now? I can make a house visit. I can do email. I can always answer questions over the phone. Most importantly, you'll be incredibly irritable and annoying soon. However, I will not give up and leave you alone. Eun-sung. Please call me Dr. Cho at the hospital, Ms. Hwang. No one. Not a single doctor. No one will take you. You don't come in for check-ups. You nitpick on the phone, wanting proof for why certain things are harmful. You have a reputation as being a notorious pain in the ass. I'm the only doctor in the world who will accept you. Look. I may be made of harder stuff than most people out there. But I'm not strong enough to let my blind date checks out my vagina. All my friends' wives were uncomfortable at first, too. But in due time, they got used to it. Clearly, there's something wrong with them. Nothing is wrong with them. They're just moms. Then what? I told him no way, and then I stormed out. Find a good OBGYN for me, will you? Someone who can do house visits, doesn't nag, and does email. Someone who is appropriately distant while performing precise check-ups. With at least ten years of experience. Preferably a woman. It'd be easier to ask for a rich, smart, well-raised, nice and good-looking guy who will love only you. Remember that handbag you mentioned? The one that makes you feel like you're on Champs-Élysées? The ostrich bag? It's sold out. The brand manager dropped me a call. Offered me one if I wanted it. But it's not really my style. Should I just tell her no? Don't worry about a thing. I'll hire a private eye if I have to. Yeah? Yup. Let's go! Is it okay to let them play? I can design on my own. I don't need any help. Hello, Mother. Dinner? Who is the reservation under? Jang Yu-hui. Come with me. Hello. Have a seat. Excuse me, but who are you? Are you okay with living in the States once we're married? I heard you inherited quite a sum from your birth mother. How about investing in information technology? Excuse me. Do you like me? Well... You're all right... Then let's stop wasting time here. Should we head on up? Sh-shall we? We can't go up together since people will talk. You go on ahead. I'll join you in ten minutes. To the suite. Idiot. She's carrying another guy's baby. You'll get really hurt. You were never a man to me. Don't sneak up on me like that. You look like a ghost. Tae-gang, how about a drink? What? This is the only place I know. I like it. Here. Oh, my goodness. Who is this pretty lady as white and beautiful as fresh snow? This is my friend. And this is my... Co-worker. Right. I thought all your female co-workers are weird. When did I say that? Hello, I am Lee Chung-baek, the young CEO of this hip joint. Yeom Na-ri. A name as beautiful as your face. And what soft, beautiful hands. Go get the menu. My friend, there is only one thing on the menu today. Beauties-drink-free wine. Tell me anything you want to eat. Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Western. I can cook anything from any country that's part of the OECD. And if you tell me the liquor you like, I can whip something up for you. I hope you enjoy the food. Jeez. He mixes a mean cocktail. Hey, who is that? His co-worker. Beautiful, isn't she? What is beauties-drink-free wine? See, he makes his own wine... Who does he take after to ooze with charm like that? He takes after you. - Right? - Yes. Hey, Mom. Why are you so late? It's not good for the baby. Your house was a total pig pen with nothing edible in the fridge. I told you time after time to hire a housekeeper. But you never listen to what I say. Mom. What's with you? Go away, it's too hot. Mom. Eat up. I know you haven't been eating well because of morning sickness. It's good. Aren't you eating? Don't worry about me. Where's Dad? He's not ready to face you yet. What? You fool. You should've been careful. Menopause already at 37? That doctor's a quack. See? I got pregnant just fine. This is no time to joke. Mom, I'm doing better than you think. I'm still getting used to the idea, but it is getting better. And sometimes, I talk to the baby. I gave her a fetus name, too. What? Ankle. What kind of name is that? My ankle is the best feature of my body. Ji-an, though you're my daughter, I've always been envious of you. Not because you're successful and rich, but because you create your own path. Since it happened anyway, do your best to raise the child. I'll help you. Take care of yourself, okay? Call me if you crave anything. You're leaving already? Yes, before I miss the last train. Mom, just sleep over. Actually, your father is waiting outside. He came with you? What took you so darn long? I had no choice. Her house was a total wreck. Do you know what time it is? Hurry along, we'll miss our train. Ankle, when you grow up, don't hurt me like I did with my parents. Okay? Come from time to time. SUSPICIOUS POCHA Actually, come often. Every day. Please come every day! - Bye. - Bye. Bye! I called you a cab. It'll be here soon, so wait a few minutes. I want to take a walk. Wow, I never knew a place like this existed in Seoul. Tae-gang, tell me about your family. I live with my father. My grandmother already passed away. And your mother? I never had one. I see. I have two mothers. Jealous? My birth mother was a shoe designer. So I wanted to become a designer, too. You can do it. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't beat designers with natural talent. But you get to order around those designers. Let's go. Oh no! Oh no. Are you okay? Let me see. You snapped it right off. Wear these. Go on. Man... Don't worry, I'll fix it. It's a piece of cake. Dad, fix this for me. It's not working out for me. Hand it over. No problem. This. You tore it! Oh no. Shoot. Apologize and buy her lunch. This belongs to the vice president. That girl earlier? Punk, why didn't you tell me sooner? Jeez, give it. I'll do it. It tore more! Do something! Jeez. What the heck is this? Hold on. Calm down, relax. Give me a moment. Will she really come all the way here? This doctor will dive into the wild for a patient. I like her already. Where did you find her? You know how well-connected I am. The doctor will be here soon. Good luck, dear friend. I'm off. Thanks. Bye. I will go anywhere for a patient. Medical service on the go. I'm Dr. Cho Eun-sung. Well-connected, huh? She's dead. Your parents came by yesterday? Yes. That's good to hear. I'm glad. It wasn't intentional, but your meddling led to decent results. I'll interpret that as a thank you. While you're at it, take good care of me. Do you mean it? I admit that I didn't take things seriously. I was never interested in babies or prenatal care. I assumed it would come naturally since everyone does it. But after seeing my parents, I want to do a good job. But... I want a female doctor to check my vagina. Since we don't have much time today, I'll just ask a few questions. Are you sleeping well? Yes. Any bleeding or abdominal pain? None. Are you eating enough folic acid, iron, and vitamins? I plan to from now on. Urine and stool? I pee often enough. You're constipated, right? Yes. Eat food with a lot of fiber and don't hold back on anything. Particularly farting. Doesn't your bellybutton itch? It does itch a little. Why is that? Your stomach is starting to expand. It's going to keep hurting and itching. But no scratching. And you'll need to change your bra. Why? Don't you have maternity underwear? I don't need them yet. Buy them at once. And if you get knots, massage them. Look, like this. Like this. They're going to keep getting knotted up. You need to relieve them. Outward in. Pay attention while I'm showing you. From the outside in, like this. I'm sorry. Ji-an. Ji-an. What do you think? It's certainly becoming something different. Does it look weird? Not exactly. I wouldn't say weird. Just confess that you ruined them. Shoot. They're probably expensive. I should make them match regardless. Hey, I know a good fortune-teller. "The soothsayer embracing the Sun." How about buying a talisman? So... About your shoes from last night... I tried my best to fix them, but... I'm sorry, I'll pay for them. You ruined them? They were expensive. Right? When I get paid this month... It's fine. Instead, let me keep the shoes you lent me. My shoes? Tae-gang. You wear 270, right? You don't get why women wear heels, right? Wear these all weekend and write up a report. But... But... So... Aren't you getting married? Who, me? Isn't it natural to rush to get married if they're pregnant? Who says you have to get married if you're pregnant? Are you not going to marry him? Why, because I'm old? For my parents? Because people expect it? Because I'm pregnant? Then, what marriage is that? It's just like being shackled. Does he agree? When you're pregnant with his baby? Everyone has different sets of values. What kind of rotten values is this? Have you lost your mind? This isn't the 23rd century. You don't live on Andromeda alone. Shackles or not, you should get married if you have someone. It's your duty to take responsibility for the baby. I'll make my decisions and take responsibility for my life. What about the baby, huh? You were born to a single parent, right? I was. Did you ever think you were unhappy or lonely? No. There's your answer. You're excused. Are you worried about something? No, nothing. I'm just recharging. You and your love for babies. Make one with your future wife. What are your thoughts on adoption? Adoption is good. More people do it publicly now. Why? Are you going to adopt? I'm considering it. First you say you're getting married, and now adoption? That was one powerful missile from Cupid. Do you think I can handle it? Raising someone else's child like my own. Would I be able... to give the child unwavering love for the rest of my life? I'm willing to bet 100,000 won that you can, because it's you. Cheapskate. Make it 120,000 won. - Who threw away good shoes? - Let me try them on. They look good on you. Let me try them on. Hello. They look good. Beautiful. Excuse me, those shoes... We didn't steal them. They were in the recycling bin. I want to buy them. Is this enough? Sure. Here. Wow. They're superb. Your company makes shoes like this? They're not ours. Someone refashioned our shoes. Hold on. So... About your shoes from last night... I tried my best to fix them, but... I know who made these. Sorry. Hey. I'm sorry. You're causing a disruption. I don't get why women wear these. Hey, careful. What do I write? I have no clue. Let me try. Oh, they pinch. That hurts. Hey, are these really meant for people's feet? I think I need to dress the part. Say what? That looks small. Hey, that may fit. Up! Ow, you got skin! Bite down hard. One, two! - Where's three? - What? We want him to look like a successful director at a company. Someone chic. Well? Gag! No good? Why not? Seriously. Stop that. Wrong way. Sorry. Wow! You look pretty! You look totally pretty! You look like a completely different person. Wow. I can't bear the embarrassment. Hey. When a man puts his mind to it, he has to follow through. Come with me. Smile. Hello. It keeps bunching up. Stop that. Does it look all right? It slid up a bit. This side? Fix it! Will you stop that? Hello. Now do you understand why women wear heels? I'm even more clueless. Why do they wear skirts, pantyhose, or make-up? Now, I'm even more confused. You should ask your father. I already did. Do you know what he said? "To seduce men." That's exactly it. If I write that, Medusa will have my head... PROJECT MAKING A MOM OUT OF HWANG JI-AN What? Don't turn around. What is that jerk doing? Who is it? My goodness, it's detailed. I came up with the outline, but I'll be needing your help. She won't listen to me. She's as stubborn as a mule. She'll listen to you. Look at page two. Okay. Here. That jerk! Hey, don't! Never meddle in other people's affairs. I can't stand by and do nothing! Please, don't. Relax. Think of your father. You must not act, please. This will lower the swelling and help with blood circulation. I see. The baby's father should be doing this. It can't be helped. I'm so pissed. It takes two to tango, so why is she suffering alone? He's probably enjoying the show, not realizing it's his kid. Is she still in touch with the father? They work together. Why him, of all people? It pisses me off the more I think about it. Is his name... What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? You dirty scumbag! I'm sorry. Is violence your only solution? Are you that pathetic? It's better than running away like a coward. Why are you so concerned? Is it because he's the baby's father? Don't they look good together? Ms. Hwang looked pretty. Where are you going? I don't think I can do this. Forget it, let's stop wasting time. Married? I just want her to be happy. Subtitle translation by Jeong Lee
