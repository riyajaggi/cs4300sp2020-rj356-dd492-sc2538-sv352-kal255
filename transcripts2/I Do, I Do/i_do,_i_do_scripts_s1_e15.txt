 You can see, right? Here's the head. The body. Arms and legs. So you're Ankle. It looks like me, don't you think? Jeez. Ankle, it's Daddy. Hi. Listen to the heartbeat. What's with the unmanly tears?

 I'm touched by my son's strong heartbeat. Son? That's right. I forgot to mention. It's a girl. A girl? But jokbal cravings usually indicate a boy. Wait, are you disappointed that Ankle's a girl? It's not like that. She can't play soccer. That was never going to happen. Besides, women can play soccer, too. I like that she's a girl. Yeah, right. You were disappointed. I was not.

 You frowned and furrowed your brows. I did not. Doctor, I didn't frown, did I? Well, I'm not quite... See, he says no. Doctor, be straight with him. There was major forehead wrinkling. Yes, perhaps a little... Are you calling him a liar? He's a doctor, for god's sake. CHO EUN-SUNG How was the check-up? What's their problem? They started off being all emotional, complete with tears, but they left fighting. That woman. Is that her? Right? The one in the magazine. Don't let on. You keep telling me to ignore these things. You should've told me about this... No questions, no nitpicking. Send in the next patient. Go away. What? Fine, I'm leaving. No questions asked. Seriously. Stop the car. What? I said, stop the car. Get out. Are you still mad? I really wasn't disappointed. I'm serious. Take the bus. I have to go somewhere. Besides, we can't go to work together. Get out. She's so heartless. Hello. What brings you here? I was in the neighborhood. Can I get some water? Ms. Ji, a glass of water. Thank you. I'm glad you're here. You've gained weight, right? Take some new clothes. This one is hot. This is totally you. How much does it cost to open a shop like this? What? Why? For the baby's father? As soon as money gets involved, it's going to get weird. You've got to draw a line. That's not it. I was thinking maybe I should open a store. You? Why? Right? It must be the heat. I'm talking nonsense. Bye. Where are you going looking so miserable? The tiger's den. Have a seat. What brings the brave single mother here? I'm sincerely sorry... for disappointing you. As for the flowers, I think I was... being way too emotional. Regardless, if I offended you, I sincerely apologize. Why the sudden submissiveness? This isn't like you. I know you cared for me, and that's why you were disappointed. You even bought the president's shares so you could support me. That's why I couldn't tell you. I was ashamed. Couldn't you graciously let bygones be bygones, and look to the future? I don't want to lose my baby or the company. No one cares for the company or knows it as well as I do. I'm sure you'll agree. A mother treasures her child, and a child needs her mother. That's why... the company needs me. That's why... I have to stay. Please, Madam. A child needs her mother? You're more naive than I thought. Loving a child doesn't make you the mother. Who says the company is yours? I left my dear child with a nanny, and the nanny wants to play the mother. You're just the babysitter. Replaceable at any time, got it? LETTER LETTER OF RESIGNATION This is really a person? She's tiny, but she's got everything she needs. Here's her head, her body, her arms, and her legs. Hello? Pardon? Hello, Father. You're in front of the office? My father? I'm not sure what to call you... Just call me Mr. Hwang. Okay, Mr. Hwang. You can call me Mr. Park... You may just call me Park or whatever you're comfortable with. I'll leave it to you. Your son is leaving for America in two days, is that right? He takes after me and is very talented. The company is sending him on a scholarship... - Will you let him go? - Pardon? He's going to run off to live his life after impregnating my daughter? Did you know that my son proposed, but she rejected him? He asked her to marry him, but she flat out refused. He must not be very trustworthy if she refused despite being pregnant. I can't disagree. Why is he so whipped? And he calls himself a man? Hey, why do you keep implying that my son is a wimp? - When did I do that? - This whole time. Calling him untrustworthy and whipped. They got pregnant together, so why should I be apologetic? Having a son isn't something to apologize for. It's clear that Ji-an pulled some strings for both your jobs. I'd say a little appreciation is in line. What? Like hell! Look here! Your daughter put us through hell! I had to wear a wig to make sure she didn't recognize me at the office! Don't make me laugh! Look here, Park! Park? You told me to call you whatever I want. I keep pulling out my hair when I think of the doctor son-in-law I lost because of your son. I weep blood and tears thinking about my would-be rich daughter-in-law! Besides, you don't even have hair to pull. You! How dare you? I'm against this marriage! Your daughter already settled that. I won't allow it even if she gives in! Like my son will wait for her forever? I don't want an ill-tempered daughter-in-law either! Who are you calling your daughter-in-law? My bad. My grandchild's mother. You should've controlled yourself. I held it and held it until I exploded. That nasty temper and foul mouth. Like father, like daughter. So? How did it end? He says to sign an oath if you won't get married. That you won't bother her for child custody. He wants to add the baby to their family registry. And? I told him, no way. What does he take us Miryang Parks for? Whichever Hwangs they are, they can't be as distinguished as us Parks. She won't have my last name. Don't worry. I won't compromise on her last name, no matter what. How could you say that to him? He was being shameless instead of begging for forgiveness. You were just supposed to find out about his father and tell him that we want the child to be part of both families' lives. That's what we agreed on. But he kept pushing my buttons! Jeez, seriously? We were better off not having you meet him. I've got them figured out. Ignorance galore. No point associating with them. This is your daughter's life, damn it! Why you... Hold on a second. What's gotten into you? How can we not associate with the baby's father? What's important isn't your petty pride! Jeez, men. This woman, seriously... I'll take care of this as we discussed. Are you okay? What? I'm fine. I'm glad you'll be here, Ms. Ma. I know you're busy with your child, but look after the team, too. I will. And you might have to go on the business trip to Paris this fall. What about you? Right, you'll be nearly full term then. Don't worry, I'll go in your place. What do we do about the annual summer event? Your idea last year was a huge success. Ms. Hwang. DIRECTOR HWANG JI-AN You know, progesterone. Those hormones are driving me up the wall. I used to cry whenever I saw older women because they reminded me of my late mother. Where were we? Let's call it a day. - Chute, aren't you leaving? - Go on ahead. - Bye. - Good night. - Bye-bye. - Bye. Good night. MEET ANKLE NAME ANKLE TALK TO ANKLE When will I do all of these? Aren't you going home? Go ahead. What about you? I have work to finish up. Let's go on a date. I planned our entire evening. We'll ride the cable car to Seoul Tower, put a lock-of-love on the fence. There's a famous pork cutlet place there. We can eat there and take a walk... Next time. When? Three years later? We only have three days. Technically two, since I leave on the third day. Every second is precious to me. Hang out with someone else today. We'll go out tomorrow, okay? Are you still mad that I was disappointed the baby's a girl? No. Then what is it? You can work after I'm gone. What's so urgent? You have a long career ahead of you. Nothing is set in stone. Who knows what will happen tomorrow? So what? You insist on working? Sorry. Sorry. Fine then, work all you want. That's what you like best anyway. DIRECTOR HWANG JI-AN If it's not too much trouble... Yes? May I see your forehead? My forehead? See, my mommy says a wide forehead makes a kind and good wife. I see. Your mother is your ideal woman? What a good son. I understand, I want to marry someone like my daddy. You do? Yes. Right, my forehead. Look. This is my ponytail, not bangs. You can touch it if you want. I never had Botox or anything. Adults say it looks pleasant. Will your mommy like it? Yes. She'll love it. That's good to hear. Excuse me while I go fix my make-up. It won't take long. But. What the... Back already? Check this out. Pretty, no? Pictures turn out great here. You didn't leave. Why would I? Did you freshen up? Let me see. My, I can't even tell. It looks so natural. Do you like the natural look? Cosmetics are a must for men these days. So what's the market value of your father's property? I've been studying a bit of real estate. Prices in that neighborhood skyrocketed this year. What's the mortgage on the land? Let me be completely honest. I think it's very tacky to dig around behind people's backs. We should be open about these things... Yum, this is delicious. Do you own your own apartment or no? I do. I knew it. Where? Well, actually... Oh my! What the heck? Did our love mean nothing to you? What? Calm down. Let me explain. Forget it! I won't hear it. You can have him. - Sweetie? - What in the world? Sweetie! I... So... Oh, my god. I should've known when you brought out the mascara. It didn't even smudge. Is it waterproof? Yes. I am so offended. Was the water necessary? It spiced things up. How did you know this was my forte? This makes up for the jokbal. Agreed. Why not just reject her? Why the act? This is the only way I can stay single without being a bad son. It must be tiring to be you. Shouldn't you be out with Ji-an? You're leaving soon. She's so darn busy. I hardly get to see her at work either. It's like she's possessed by a workaholic ghost. Didn't you like her already knowing that? But this is too much. What do you think will happen if the truth gets out? You'll be fired without a doubt. And Tae-gang's support will be pulled. If it wasn't for your dad, I would fight back tooth and nail. There has to be a way. Blackmail the chairman about Na-ri messing up my collaboration sample. Or make a huge deal about Madam Jang publishing that article about me. Hello, Mr. Shin. I have some legal questions. This isn't for me, but for my friend. It's about being given the sack unfairly. The baby will look like this by next week. She'll have hair and nails by the 18th week, and will be more active. I see. Wow. Can the baby really hear the sounds around her? Yes, she can. It's good to read and talk to her. The father's voice is easier to hear than the mother's. So talk to her while you still can. Ankle will get used to your voice more than mine. You don't want to go, do you? I don't. Then why are you? I want to make something of myself. In gambling, you need to bet big to win big. I need to accomplish in 3 years what Ji-an did in 15. And that's guaranteed if you go? There's a higher chance. The company's paying, and a brilliant designer offered me a job. I swore to Ji-an that I'd look ahead and only go straight. Looking ahead doesn't mean you'll walk straight. The proper way is to check both sides and look behind you. Sometimes you have to stop to read the road signs. And sometimes you have to ask people for directions. Don't try to make me weak. It's better for me if you leave. The goalpost is already small. It's better without a goalie. Of all the... You're not the striker type. You'd be good with assists. That's not a bad idea. This is expensive, man! Revenge. Come here. Seriously? - Okay. Is that how you'll play? - Stay back. Ankle will get used to your voice more than mine. THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER "Once upon a time, there was a shoemaker. Though he was hard-working, he always lived in poverty. Eventually, he only had enough leather to make one final pair of shoes." There's no way out. I've got no other way. I don't want to quit like this. Why didn't you call first? You would've told me not to come. We can't go in together anyway. I'll get out along the way. I just wanted to see you. Will you... hold me? What's wrong? Did something happen? No. Are you really okay? Yeah. LETTER OF RESIGNATION You couldn't find another way? You wanted a quick answer, and I'm out of time. And I couldn't be dishonorable with my baby watching. But I haven't given up. I'll just wait until he leaves. Company policy says I can work a month after turning in my resignation. I'll look for a way out then. All right. Please. Don't tell Tae-gang about this. I won't. It'll be our secret. Ta-da! Isn't she a looker? Who's that? My wife's junior from college. The important thing is that this picture wasn't airbrushed. I've met her in person. Beautiful face, gorgeous body. And she's still in her twenties. Do you love me or what? Enough to work weekends for me? Not you, too. Are you taking my parents' side? Just stop it, you idiot. Stop what? I'll be that woman's doctor from here now on. It's too late. Forget it. Or have her switch hospitals. How can she jerk you along like this? This isn't about my feelings for her. I'm curious to meet the child when she's born. She sent my life on such an emotional rollercoaster ride. Man, if I had felt this way about expecting mothers sooner, I'd be the Pestalozzi of obstetrics. You're Gandhi, not Pestalozzi. A deluded Gandhi. So, no to the girl? No thanks, man. Come in. About tonight... You're not planning on working, are you? I'm going home early. Really? Come over by 7 p.m. for some quality time together. Okay. What should we do? Time to plan the evening. So pretty. One, two. One, two, three. What? Hold on. Eat this. Such a sweetheart. Open wide. - Good? - Good. - Really? - I'm so happy. One, two, three. Gross. Let's do it again. One. Two. Sorry. What shampoo do you use? It smells heavenly. I forgot the most important item. Ankle, let's send your daddy off with a smile. Then we'll worry about us afterward. The pure-as-snow Bong-soo. Chute, this is huge! You know my second best friend, Mr. Jeong in HR? Well, I heard from him... that... Smells good, right? Are you hungry? Have a seat. Sit. Sorry, I tried to cook myself, but it didn't work out. So I ordered food. What shall we do after dinner? Watch a movie or... Hey. You must be hungry. Let's eat. Open wide. Come on, it's embarrassing. Open wide. Did you resign? - How did you know? - Why? I just want to take a rest. Like I'd believe that? I mean it. Once I start showing more, it'll be hard to work anyway. Did the company force you to quit? What a bunch of jerks. How could they do this? You worked so hard. So what if you're a single mother? We should report them to the labor department. I have no choice. It's fine. It's not fine! I'll quit too. What? Screw the company. Both my dad and I will resign. What are you talking about? I'm doing this for y... You can't quit. Stop talking nonsense. You have to go to America tomorrow. Why should I study using their cheap money? Succeeding that way would mean nothing. This might be better for us. How about we start a business with my dad? We showed great teamwork for the collaboration. A business is not... Hold on. Hi, Ms. Ma. What? Calm down and explain slowly. I see. I'll be right there. I need to go to the office. It's an emergency. Don't go. So what if there's a company emergency? Why should you care? What about your darn pride? The company is my child, too. If you're a parent, you don't factor that in. Start eating. I'll be right back. I'm not going to America. I'm going to curse that rotten company. I pray their stock value drops, as well as their property value. Please ruin the collaboration... Let it be a bust, too. 1.7 million sq. feet of leather, ruined on the ship from Italy. We're talking a net loss of 600 million won. No, we didn't unload the leather yet. If we sue, can we win? What happened? How is there mold on the leather? I'll call you back. Ms. Ma, did you call her? I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do. It's no big deal. I can handle it. We wouldn't have this problem if we used a plane. Who changed it to a ship? It was while you were on vacation. It was my order. I wanted to save costs. I'm talking to the lawyer. We'll file a suit... A lawsuit won't solve anything. We worked with that company for eight years. Hold on a second. Let's figure something out. Should we sell them to a bag company? They like the vintage look and use leather with discoloration. That's a great idea. But will they buy discolored leather? We'll have to convince them. It's quality leather. I want a list of bag manufacturers in Seoul and Gyeonggi. Get on it. Move! Chop-chop! Ma'am, the merit of this Italian leather is its mottled look. You guys make smaller handbags. That means more bags of varied colors. You can kill two birds... no, several birds with one stone. Go on, touch it. Totally soft, right? It's smoother than silk. It's really, really soft. You know our company is all about credibility. This leather is perfect for your designs. Try them out. You won't regret it. Go on, touch it. I totally suck at this kind of thing. It's do or die. Hello, we're here to see the manager of the design team. Please, sir, just this once. Get out! Now! We're not solicitors. We're shoe designers. I don't care. Leave. Just let us meet the manager, please? You people... Sir! Shoot. Excuse me, may I help you? The actress Kim Na-jeong is here for a meeting. We're in a hurry. We must avoid the paparazzi. Oh, right. Go on in. You only get this authentic, faded vintage look with natural light. It takes time like fine wine. And see these natural scratches made by the rough Pacific winds? Know what this is? Art. Each bag will have a different pattern. They'll be unique and one-of-a-kind. We don't go around showing this leather to just anyone. Plus, vintage is totally in this season. Am I right? Take a look. It's crazy right now. Everyone wants a piece of this. You don't want it? Shall we leave? It's okay if you buy only a small amount. Okay, bye. VICE PRESIDENT YEOM NA-RI What's this? The daily log I kept for ten years since I became the manager. The recent stuff is in this file. They started off as diary entries. Now they're reference material. It'll help to look through them. Why are you... This company was more than a job to me. For 15 years, it was my home, my hometown, my school, and my child. Take care of it just in case something happens to me. If you check my records, I made a similar mistake in 2004. Two years after becoming the manager. I wanted to curl up and die. It was a miracle I wasn't fired. People are different from animals. They learn from their mistakes. After falling down seven times, we learn to land properly on the eighth try. Don't lose heart. This is just your first fall. Hello? Really? Thank you. I'll send them over soon. Just sold 250,000 sq. feet. - Oh my gosh. - Really? Ms. Hwang, we sold 100,000 sq. feet. We sold 200,000. At 60% of the original price. - I sold 350,000 by myself. - That much? We sold 700,000 sq. feet. - Really? - How? Tae-gang is good in persuading people. He made me want to buy the leather, too. - Thanks. - Good job, Tae-gang. Good work, everyone. I never knew we had such great teamwork. We're not going to call it a night, are we? What about Tae-gang's farewell party? - Let's do it! - Dinner! - Dinner! - Dinner! Okay. Let's do it. It's on me. What about Ms. Yeom? Ms. Ma, you... I'll bring her. Go on ahead. Everyone's having dinner at the restaurant nearby. Tell them I can't make it. What's this? Read it. It's not a love letter. LETTER OF RESIGNATION Tae-gang. I heard about Ms. Hwang's resignation. How did you know? I'm incredibly disappointed in this company. What? Do you just ditch people when they're no longer of use? She worked herself to the bone for 15 years. You saw how she dropped everything to solve this crisis. Firing someone like her is a huge loss for the company. I know. Then please reconsider her resignation. Do you even know why she's resigning? Clearly the company is forcing her out because she's a single mother. She's doing it to protect you. What? What are you talking about? Welcome. She's quitting over a few rumors? That's even more absurd. Yet being forced out because she's a single mom makes sense? Absurd things happen every day in this line of work. If it gets out that you're the baby's father, her career and her image that she built will fall apart in a heartbeat. Then I'll quit. That will solve everything. Your resignation solves nothing. She didn't want to quit like this, but she's trying to save at least you. You need to think hard about what she truly wants. Nothing is set in stone. Who knows what will happen tomorrow? Will you... hold me? Where are you? Enjoy your dinner. I'll come by your place later. There are so many things I want to do for you before I leave. Since I can't do them all, I chose the one I wanted to do most. Make shoes for our family. If it's for you and Ankle, I will devote my life to making shoes. I saw the shoes. I'm really touched. You know that's major praise coming from me, right? Do your best... in America, okay? I'm not going. Not even if America were heaven. What are you... I'll be honest with you. At first, I decided to go out of anger. Then I decided to go for you and Ankle. I promised I'd become a worthy father for her. But I never wanted to go and I still don't. You're talented. With a little hard work, you'll become a good designer. Succeeding as a designer isn't the only way to make me a worthy father. I don't want to work with Jake Han or study abroad for free. I'm more curious about the sound of Ankle's first cry. Which foot will she use to take her first step? What expression will she make during her first haircut? Will she say "Mommy" or "Daddy" first? That's what I care about more. They only happen once. I won't get a second chance. An opportunity like this is rare, too. It might not come again. What about you? My first priority is you, and your first priority is shoes. Why are you giving it all up for me? It's not for you. The odds are against me right now. Like you fought in the past because the odds were in your favor? Why are you acting so different? Hwang Ji-an, you are a workaholic. You charge forward and never look back. I love you just the way you are. I'll always be by your side. So stop trying to send me away. - I was totally blindsided. - My god. And that's when Ms. Yeom... - Everyone to the lobby. - Why? This is huge. - What? - Mega-huge! - Mega? - Mega? Out of my way. Doesn't it feel like we're celebrities on the red carpet? Definitely. That's just tacky. Who cares? Pose for them. Take the picture. Mr. Park! Out there! What? I think we did enough to fuel the rumors. Shall we go to work? So the conclusion is use birth control. One mistake can change your life forever. You never disappoint. Shall I rip up your resignation letter? What happens if you dig in the same spot for 15 years? Let's not be afraid. Life is do or die anyway. Good luck. Please be the real mother of our company.
