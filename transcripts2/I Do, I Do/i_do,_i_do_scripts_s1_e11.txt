 EPISODE 11 We have a biological relationship. It's the same as receiving sperm from a sperm bank. I'll stand by Ms. Yeom and assist her. I'll make sure that the company isn't negatively affected. So please try to understand, Madam. If you're so sure of yourself, why did you hide the pregnancy? After the collaboration, I was going to... Is it because you're terrified you might lose everything? Compare 15 years with the company to just a few months with the baby.

 You tossed aside happiness, health, and family. You invested 15 years while people criticized you for being relentless. There isn't much to maternal instinct. Maternal instinct is the affection you feel for shoes. Your shoes and the company are your children. I never considered giving up the company. Never. It's not up to you. You just said it, I dedicated 15 years of my life to the company. I've come this far purely on my talent and effort. I don't believe anyone has the right to force me out. It does not require any rights to fire you. If all you want is to keep the baby and be a mother, then do it. You'll find out which child is more precious in the long run.

 Pay a visit to Dr. Kim. As soon as possible. Bye. I didn't realize you had a guest. Ji-an, what's wrong? Ji-an. Ji-an. What is it? - My stomach... - Ji-an. Find out who he is. Yes, ma'am. Man, why is time going by so slowly? Morning, please hurry. Come quick. Seriously. You won't even let me get mad at you. So... Is the baby okay? If you're so worried, why didn't you take care of yourself? Don't worry, Ankle is just fine. I can't say the same for you, though. You have high ALT and blood pressure on top of an accelerated pulse. This may sound cliche, but you need complete rest. Take a few days off. I can't. The collaboration competition is coming up, and I absolutely have to win. Did something happen? That woman last night. Who was she? The chairman's wife. The chairman's wife? Why would she visit you so late? She found out I was pregnant. I said I'd give up becoming the president, so she threatened to fire me. That's absurd. The only way I can survive is through proving my ability. I can't lose this. Then work on it at home. I need to gather material and make samples. I need to go out working. Don't you have any help? Any employees? The only teammate I have is... LEAVE OF ABSENCE Is she feeling unwell? She has a bad cold. She needs to rest at home for a few days. She's so unpredictable. This close to the deadline? Here you go. It's a good excuse. She can blame her cold if she lost. Don't count your chicks before they hatch. Oh, right. You're still on her side. Have you considered our offer? Can you give me more time to think it over? I have to discuss it with my father. He knows how to raise his value. That's fine. Think it over carefully. Thank you. How sick are you? I'm not sick. I'm just a little stressed. Do you have a fever? What? What were you expecting? What? You little brat. What should I do? Well, you can start by assisting me with the design. You'll have to go to the stores for the materials. Buy the leather, accessories, and other material. I'm not sure I can trust you though. Don't you worry. I'll be your avatar. I'll be like a remote-controlled robot. Your past record says otherwise. Whom will you trust if you don't trust me? I'm your protégé, after all. Where does this unfounded confidence come from? Here? Jake Han grabbed Chute's hand and got on his knees. "Please come with me to America." No way. You must be really happy. About what? He's going straight from the gutter to the penthouse. Am I in the gutter? Of course not. He didn't stumble on this by dumb luck. He gets it from me, you know. I know, but you don't seem very happy. Of course, I'm happy for my son. I'm just a little sad that we'll be apart. Bong-soo! Hey, Chute. Ms. Yeom. Who is this? Da... He's a dear friend from my hometown. You know... The new pattern maker. Right. Hello, I'm the new pattern maker. I'm totally unrelated to this guy. Aren't you Tae-gang's father? We met briefly yesterday. I'm really sorry. No need to apologize. But why did he keep it a secret? Well, the truth is, he used to make knock-offs... But not anymore. In the past, for some time. Is that so? I'll tell him to quit. It's fine, let him work. It's all in the past, right? He's a very skilled pattern maker. Gosh, you are so unbelievably sweet and kind. I know, right? Strangely, I become that way when I'm with you. Anyway, thank you. That's it? When I get paid, I'll buy you something delicious. Promise? Promise. She dated him recently. They met on a blind date. Their families have already met. I see. CHO EUN-SUNG She has a decent boyfriend, so why? We have to pick one of these designs. The motif is nostalgia, so we need to aim for something sentimental. What do we do? It's not like we can ask people one by one. I've got it. Eeny-meeny-miny-mo Catch a tiger by its toe Eeny-meeny-miny-mo This one. I just wanted to make you laugh. Keep your mouth shut for the next hour. AREN'T YOU HUNGRY? JOKBAL Why haven't you left yet? I'll be back in the blink of an eye. Compare 15 years with the company to just a few months with the baby. Maternal instinct is the affection you feel for shoes. Sweetie. Happy second anniversary. Let's blow out the candles. Do you think that's suede or calfskin? What a beautiful color. I wonder what brand it is. Sweetie, what are you doing? What? Oh, sorry. - Let's drink. - Okay. Should we go on a trip? A trip? Sorry, but I'm busy. Just take five days off. You like Europe. We'll go there. France is good. Or how about Spain or Italy? Italy. Italy it is. It's made in Italy. One second. What brand are your shoes? I'm not sure, they were a gift. Why do you ask? I was curious. - Is this calfskin or suede? - Sweetie. Ji-an. - I'm not sure. - You don't know? - No. - Is it an Italian brand? If all you want is to keep the baby and be a mother, then do it. You'll find out which child is more precious in the long run. I can't live like that. Ankle, your mommy can't live like that. Try to understand, please. I told him I'm a terrible cook, and he offered to cook for you himself. Plenty of nutrients is the first step to recovery. Hold your compliments until after dinner. Why isn't that boy around? I thought he was helping you with work. Yes... Him. I sent him on an errand. Who? Just someone. What the... Not again. Shoot. Excuse me, but is this restaurant closed for good? The owner closed it temporarily to take care of her sick mother-in-law. The restaurant was closed. We'll have to make do with this... Hello. Come on in. Eat up for Ankle's sake. Help yourself. You, too. This meat is really tender. Is this domestic pork? It's much better than fancy restaurants. Try it. Have some of this, too. Thanks. How thoughtful. Everyone knows that instant food is bad for expecting mothers. Guess he's too young to know better. I'll just take this home. No, leave it. It'll be my late-night snack. The grease stains are still here. Don't you know how to do the dishes? Use hot water. Okay. The two of them make a good picture. Hurry up. Can't you keep them both? I'm just saying. Alternate weeks. Aren't you going to meet your baby? Me? No, I have no plans. Jun-hui's leaving. - No, I'm not. - Let's go. Would you like some meat? You're... Hi! It's Snow White. Good evening. My gosh. I don't know how to thank you. First, you helped Tae-gang, and now me. Please don't be so formal out of the office. Consider me your son's friend. If you insist, Ma'am. Let me pour you a drink. Sure. May I call you "Father?" I hear you made knock-offs... - Goodness, I'm sorry. - Are you okay? It's fine. A little back when I was young and foolish, but not anymore. For Tae-gang's sake. That's good. Or you'd end up in prison. You have a lot of hands-on experience. How about you supervise the sample production team? It's a huge part of the collaboration. You're saying you want me to be a supervisor? Please, as a favor to me. I don't know what to say... I promise I will do my best, but... Congratulations. Wow, a supervisor. Where is Tae-gang? Tae-gang? He's working on the collaboration something with Medusa... I mean, with Ms. Hwang. At her home? The only umbrella I have is the one in this bag. You have your car. Jun-hui drove me. Here's the plan. You two can share the umbrella. Goodbye. But... That's... Come closer. I'm fine. Or don't use it at all. You're right. Jeez. How about a drink? I'm sorry. It seems that I misunderstood you. You acted out of concern and respect for your boss. It's understandable. I overreacted. You didn't misunderstand. It's true. I really do like Ms. Hwang. Speaking of which... Is it okay if I express my affections? What? You're the baby's father. I thought I should tell you out of courtesy. And I'm positive that I can raise the baby well. Let me ask you. Fine. You know I'm the baby's father, so why are you doing this? Are you going to marry Ms. Hwang? You're not. I'm simply respecting her wishes. Respect? I don't know about complicated things like that. I'm going to focus on my feelings. From now on, I'm going to express my feelings for her. I envy you. For what? You're so completely oblivious. Just know that you possess far more than you realize. What colors do you associate with the word "memory"? What are the most memorable shoes you've ever owned? Hey, Chute. Do you want to have lunch together? Me? Do you see anyone else here? I'm really grateful, but I have work... Forget it then. Don't screw up the meeting later. I won't. - What the heck? - Right? - That snob. - He's playing hard to get. Unbelievable. They wanted to eat with me. My gosh. I'm taking a survey. Hello, I'm Park Tae-gang from the design team. Please help with the survey we're doing for the collaboration. NEW SHOE IDEA SURVEYY It's for the collaboration. Please help us. Thank you. This is really important to me. Although it has to do with my job, this survey could change my life. Please fill it out as thoughtfully as you can. Thank you. Have a nice day. This is a survey. Please fill it out. It won't take long. You devious jerk. I kept asking to see her, and this is how you do it? What are you talking about? Check it out. - What? - This. You're dating someone this famous? She's pretty. "Her love story." "Her career and her love." Send a painting to the editor. Something nice. Yes, ma'am. How can you print an article without verifying the facts? You didn't even interview her. If you don't print a correction, I'll sue you for libel. FATHER Hello, Father. What's going on? When did you get back together? It's not what you think. You should've told us first instead of surprising us. People have been calling to congratulate me all morning. Who would do this? CHO EUN-SUNG No wonder she took some time off. It was to prepare for the wedding. He's the hospital director's son, a doctor, and he's crazy handsome. This is so annoying. What did she do to deserve this? I always knew Ms. Hwang would marry someone like him. What's that? Who's getting married? There's an article about Ms. Hwang's wedding. You're on her team, and yet you didn't know? Here it is. "If you're a working woman, you know it's hard to juggle work and love. But the designer Hwang Ji-an has proven that a career-driven woman can have her romance, too. She's currently dating Cho Eun-sung, son of a medical foundation director. And they're planning on getting married soon." That can't be. I had my doubts, too, but the article is very detailed, so it can be... This is for the better. First love is more beautiful when they don't work out. No! No, don't. What are you doing? Electromagnetic waves are really bad for the baby. You're talking utter nonsense. Get away. No, Eun-sung said you can't have any stress whatsoever. You know that the Internet is filled with horrible posts. Move, I just want to check one email. No, work-related stress is the most dangerous. Think about the baby. - I checked my email yesterday. - Exactly. It's time you think about the baby. Exactly. Out of my way. Ji-an, don't be too shocked, okay? Relax. No wonder I kept getting text messages congratulating me. I thought it was some strange rumor. No, don't. Think about the baby, okay? You're right. I won't - get worked up. - Don't get worked up. It's bad for the baby. That's a good girl. Do you have any idea who did this? I'm 100% positive. Madam Jang Yu-hui. Jang Yu-hui? The chairman's wife? I won't... forgive her for this. What will you do? - First, set the table. - What? First, I should eat. You're right, let's eat. First, we eat. - Isn't it strange? - What is? It's in the middle of an important event to take the time off and get married. It feels too rushed. Maybe she's pregnant. It happens in k-dramas. Her parents visited the guy at work and grab him by the collar. "You jerk, take responsibility!" Then they rush the wedding. It's a great opportunity for a designer. I expect the best from you. Enough. Next. You've gained weight. We just ate. MY JI-AN The phone has been turned off. Please... Why are you here? You don't look so well. Why won't you answer your phone? Strange people kept calling me. Are you sick? Are you... getting married? I guess you saw the article. I'm sure the rumors spread like wildfire at the office. They're probably having a field day. Then it's not true. It's not. Oh, my goodness. Hey. I'm sorry. What a relief. I'm so relieved. Did you come here during work hours to verify that? That's right. Here. I thought this may help you choose the design. I'll go through them later tonight. Bye. The motif is nostalgia, so we need to aim for something sentimental. What do we do? It's not like we can ask people one by one. He did all of this by himself? Get some rest. I'll go through them. I can handle it. Don't treat me like I'm sick. So, you're really not doing it, right? What? You know. What? Getting married? Why? Should I? No! Never mind. Stay this way. For the time being. Someday you and I will travel To a southernmost island Under the shade of a palm tree I want to kiss you I want to kiss you I want to kiss you Under the shade of a palm tree I want to kiss you I want to kiss you Look at her, all shy. I want to kiss you Hey. Hey. Hey, Tae-gang, time to go home. Hey. His eyebrows and his nose. I hope the baby also has his lips. Right? What the... Did the baby move? Stupid. What? Why didn't she wake me? Dang it. What are you doing? Isn't it obvious? You couldn't be making breakfast, could you? Wash up and get ready. You'll be late. Okay. I've never made this before, so it doesn't look very good. Help yourself. It looks delicious. Don't we seem like newlyweds? What? Thank you for breakfast. It's salty. I mean, it's not salty at all. It's perfect. Really? Did I not mix it well enough? It's fine. Just perfect. Is it that good? - It's so delicious. - Take your time. I don't cook often. But I'm good at anything, if I try. It's delicious, but... don't ever cook again. Why not? It's tiring. It's fine. Is that enough? Hold on. No. Have some more. This is enough. I can't finish it. Want more carrot juice? No, thanks. What a great morning. I want you to take over the company. When I become president, you'll be the first to go. I'll get you blacklisted in the industry, and you'll never work again. My feelings will be hurt if you refuse. I'm giving this to you as a fan of your designs. Are you in a slump? Pardon? I hope not. Prison. These designs... are imprisoned. Why was I clinging on to them? Chew with your gums if you have no teeth. Walk barefoot if you have no shoes. Draw a new design if you have nothing else. I'm going to start over from the beginning. They're being unreasonable. They refuse to print a correction. {\an8}They didn't even budge when I threatened to sue for libel. {\an8}PARK SANG-BAE {\an8}What's the big deal about this article? {\an8}There's someone else behind it. But who... They're an affiliate of Hanyeong Apparel, so look into that. The chairman's wife. She found out I was pregnant, and I said I'd give up becoming the president, so she threatened to fire me. I'd like to meet Madam Jang. Do you have an appointment? No. Would you tell her Cho Eun-sung is here? She may know who I am. Madam, Cho Eun-sung is here to see you. Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry, but she doesn't know you. Would you tell her I'm Hwang Ji-an's friend? I'm sorry. Next time, make an appointment. All right. One moment. I would like a word, ma'am. It's fine. Go start the car. Who... We ran into each other briefly in front of Ji-an's apartment. Did we? What is this about? Did you have the article printed in the magazine? There was an absurd article about Ji-an and I getting married. Why would I do that? Please print a correction article. I'm not following you. All right then. I guess it wasn't you. I'll go ahead and sue the magazine. I hope that won't cause problems for you later. I'm not sure who you are, but shouldn't you be thanking the person behind the article? You have an excuse to get married now. The man has to steady the woman's fickle heart. Good luck with your wedding planning. Are Medusa and that doctor really getting married? It makes absolutely no sense. She hooked him good. Did she freeze him like Medusa? How long would they last? A year? Two years? He'd be way too scared to try and divorce Medusa. It's not true! None of it. Everyone, they're complete lies. Who are you? None of your business. - Now, everyone back to work. Come on now. - What the... - Who are you? - Just go. - What's with him? - Get out. Go inside! Gosh. The article isn't true? Yes. But the news has already spread. I can't control it on my own. Can't you post something on the company bulletin board? Your words would have credibility. Why are you so concern about Ms. Hwang's marriage? Because it's not true. But she has a fiance. It's a misunderstanding. There's nothing going on between them. Strange, I thought she was pregnant. Do you know anything about that? About what? No. You visit her home often for the collaboration project. You can see if there's anything that shows that she's pregnant. Ms. Yeom! Are you trying to make me a spy? You're treating me like some kind of double agent. I didn't know you were such a cheat. Jeez, brat. How could you call her a cheat? She gave your father a huge promotion. - Was I a bit harsh? - Way harsh. If I were the vice president, I would fire you and your father. Dang it. If she does, I'll start my own business. How will you manage that? Ms. Hwang and I can be a husband-and-wife design team. Add in my father, and we'll be the world's greatest shoe family, no? Husband and wife? I'm going to propose to Ms. Hwang. You've lost it. Why? Why would you propose when there's the baby's father? What are you, a home-wrecker? I told the baby's father that I like her. Did you hurt your head? She isn't interested in the baby's father at all. I distinctly heard her call him a sperm bank. And she's a little interested in me. I'm almost certain.. Okay, maybe not certain. But at least, she likes me more than him. Does that change the baby's father? His genes aren't going to suddenly transform into yours. I can overcome that with love. Love, my butt. Do you think she'll accept you? She'll treat you like a psycho stalker. I know that she won't accept me easily. But she will someday. She's already falling madly and deeply with my irresistible charms. What are you going to tell your father? The truth. I'm sure he'll understand. Like hell, he will! No parent will accept his son proposing to a woman with another man's baby. What's that? Dad. What is that about? Who's proposing to a woman with another guy's baby? Mr. Park, so... We have a classmate. You know him, Jong-sik. It's about Jong-sik... No, it's... about me. What? It's about... It's about you? How do you like staying home? It's harder to bum around. How did mothers in the past do the pregnancy thing eight or nine times? Ji-an, you're in a good mood today. My design is finally turning out. I felt hopeless because of a slump, but now I can see the light again. By the way, I felt the baby move yesterday. Really? Already? She gave a small shake twice. Are you sure it wasn't just gas? It wasn't. Your baby sure is impatient. All right, let's check to see if the baby is all right. Okay. Let me see. - Well? - Hush. Ankle is saying something. What? Hold on, I'll interpret it for you. Mommy. Please listen to what I have to say. You know about the article saying you and the doctor are getting married. The witch who was here the other day did it. The doctor tried to do what he could to fix it, but it didn't work out. He feels really, really bad about that. He couldn't help you or protect you. Pass my message on to Ankle. I know how hard he's trying, even without looking. And... tell him not to feel so bad. I'm always... really grateful to him. Ankle's mom. Let's get married. What's with you, Tae-gang? Do you like Ms. Hwang? I do. I'm going to beat her, no matter what. Whether I'm dragged in or I stick out my arm myself, the result is the same. Did you hear about Ms. Hwang? You'll have to take over the company. Victory is ours. Let's do it, Ankle's mom! Subtitle translation by Jeong Lee
