 Ankle's mom. Let's get married. When I was... mistaken for the father, strangely, it didn't feel that bad. I wondered why I felt that way, and wondered, "Do I want to become Ankle's father?" Honestly, I haven't gathered the courage yet. I know how hard it is to be a father. But I can't seem to help it. I'm already a little curious.

 Why now, of all times... There's a saying that I like. "Real life begins with a tangent." If this article hadn't come up, it could have taken me a year or three. I might never have been able to say it. But the situation gave me courage. Let's enjoy the ride together. Eun-sung. I realize it's hard to decide now... No. I'll answer now. Truthfully, part of me wants to lean on you. The prospect of raising a child alone is getting scarier by the minute. And marrying you would secure my job.

 It's a sweet deal. But I can't choose marriage for reasons like that. Remember what you told me? Everyone is a coward, especially when there's something to protect. Now that I have something to protect, I don't want to be a coward. I want to face things boldly and proudly so I can brag to Ankle someday. "Your mom is a strong person." How disheartening. If you say it like that, I can't keep begging you anymore. I'm sorry. It won't be easy. Will you be okay on your own? Well... I'm not alone, so I'll be fine. Ankle, it all rests on you. I'll be watching out for you. Thank you. - Mr. Park! - Get up, you brat! - Mr. Park, don't! - You moron! You bastard. What's that? You're going to what to whom? How could you do this to me, you ungrateful jerk? You said it was hard and lonely raising me on your own. You wished someone would help. Why you? Why does it have to be you? I empathize with her because I know how you felt. And I understand and accept the baby because I love her. Love? You crazy idiot. Why you... How dare you... Calm down, Dad. I'm not crazy. Who did this to you? Who did this? Who made you like this? Dad. Listen, you fool, go to America. Just go, you hear me? Dad. Let go! Leave. You can talk later. He can't handle this. Go, now! Mr. Park. Ms. Hwang? She's the one that Tae-gang wants to propose to? She's pregnant? She's with the baby's father. In fact, she's not interested in Tae-gang at all. It's completely one-sided, so you don't have to worry. She'll kick him to the curb. Sure, he'll be hurt a little, but he'll get over it. Crazy idiot. Dad. Dad. Come on, Dad. Dad. Dad, you and I work together. Let's at least talk. Gosh! Hey! Jeez! You made me spill. Dad! I'm so sure she's pregnant. Wow, I must be psychic. VICE PRESIDENT YEOM NA-RI Why is she denying the marriage rumors? What's up with that guy I saw? They were totally dating. And who's behind this article? Why worry your pretty little head? Go ask her directly. Well? It reminds me of a scene from a movie. Movie? What movie? I don't remember the title. It's a foreign film I saw as a kid. The scene was beautiful. White butterflies flying amongst the grass. A blonde girl and a soldier were kissing in the shade of a tree. The theme song went like... Elvira Madigan? - You... - Again? What's wrong with you? Let's go with this. Love like a butterfly that flits in and out of reach. I like it. And what about adding a ribbon to the back? Like a butterfly. That'll make the shoe more lovable. What's this? Now you're giving tips? Just looking at it makes my creative juices flow. This is going to be a huge hit. Your past shoes were beautiful, but had a slightly dark tone. But this makes my heart flutter just by looking at it. Your surveys deserve some credit. Really? Now have I joined the big leagues? You just learned your ABCs. You're barely sounding out words yet. Should I tell him? Should I let it all out? This baby is yours. You're the father. Hey... Listen. I have something to say... Hold on. Hello, Ms. Yeom. Tonight? Sure, that's fine. All right. I'll see you. Bye. Is she planning to ask about the marriage rumor? Ms. Yeom wants to see you? Yeah, says she'll call when she's close. Anyway, back to what I was saying. I have to head home early. Hand this over to the pattern maker, right? - Wait, I need to... - Good night. I'm not done talking here. Listen to me. Why are you here? Are you here to see Ms. Hwang? What are you going to say? I just want to ask her something. Ask me. Why should I? Are you her spokesperson? Please stop harassing her. We all know you have the upper hand. Must you come to her home when she's sick? Don't you think you're going too far? What's with you, Tae-gang? It pains me to watch. She's finally feeling better and... Do you like Ms. Hwang? I do. But she's pregnant with someone else's baby. So what? Can't I like a pregnant woman? And since we're on the subject, please don't tell anyone about her pregnancy until she goes public herself. Please, Ms. Yeom. Na-ri. Why did you drink so much? Are you okay? Jake. I'm right here. I hate her so much. I despise her. What? Who? Jake. I'm going to beat her, no matter what. If I lose again, I'm going to kill myself. I have to win. No matter what, I have to win. The person you are trying to reach... Darn you, Na-ri. Where are you? Who's that? TAEGANG (MOBILE) Check your email. Focus on the collaboration and nothing else for now. Victory is ours. Let's do it, Ankle's mom! I made a few sample ribbons. I like number three the best. What about you? Same. Three. Your father speaks the truth. First, we focus on the collaboration. After we win, I'll tell him. Is that okay with you, Ankle? You're going to propose? Yes. To whom? Don't tell me. Ms. Yeom? What the... I like you best when you're so clueless. So naive. As clean as snow. I am pure, I admit. What's important is how, not who. Something sweet and romantic without breaking the bank. Something that will sweep her off her feet. Do you have any ideas? Women are surprisingly simple. Target one thing that they like. Let me tell you how I proposed to my wife. I bought a bunch of fake Monopoly money. "Ten years later, I'll replace these with real money." I failed, of course. But at that time, she wept with tears of joy. "I'm placing my future in your hands," she said. Yes, future. As of now, I only know how to refashion shoes. But when I become a famous designer, I'll fill your shoe room with my designs. Aim for the future. - Hello. - Congratulations. Thank you. Doctor, I saw the article. When is the wedding? Soon. Congratulations. Doctor, congratulations. You're so lucky. You're doing much better. Your blood pressure is normal. You can go out now. Can I go back to work? As long as you don't push yourself. I won't. Seriously. Sorry, it's my fault. This is not your fault. It's that old witch's doing. I'm trying to think of ways to piss her off right now. Take revenge for me, too. Well, speaking of revenge... This is my doctor, Dr. Cho Eun-sung. I'm Kim Ji-su with Woman Times. I'm Cho Eun-sung. I heard you gave her a lot of advice when she chose to stay a single mother. Yes. I did. RECORDING Thank you for your time. Thank you. This will give a lot of hope to all the single mothers out there. Also, please use a full body picture with the article. Highlight the shoes. Will do. Talk to you later. I don't know whether I'm shocked or filled with respect. Are you a masochist? Do you enjoy the torture? Why do you never choose the easy path? Did you get immunization shots when you were a kid? While you're waiting for the shot, you tremble in terror. But it's no big deal when it's done. Whether I'm dragged in or I stick out my arm myself, the result is the same. You've got guts. Except for one thing. What's that? Not telling. What is it? Come on, I'm curious. Come on. What is it? Whether I'm dragged in or I stick out my arm myself, the result is the same. Let's do it. - Hello, doctor. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Did you eat? NOT GETTING HITCHED The focal point is the cubics on the toe. Same for the button on the strap, okay? I got it. Is this Ms. Hwang's? Yes. Mind if I take a look? What's this? I thought she was in a slump. INSTRUCTIONS How did she... It's completely different from the first draft. She must've changed it when it got bad reviews. Don't worry, we'll still win. Are you in charge of this design? That's me. Can we talk outside? Sure. Hello. Tell Ms. Hwang that I won't tell anyone she's pregnant. She'll be fired before I get the chance anyway. She can start packing her things. Did you finish writing the presentation speech? I'm working on it. You should've taken more days off. Another day, and my fingers are going to dry up. How's the sample? I turned in the pattern. It should be out in two days. What's this? We're almost out. Excuse me. Yes? Two more servings of sirloin. Hanwoo beef. You ate three servings on your own. I'm eating for two. I need to build up strength to go to battle. I'm going to eat two more servings. Aren't you scared? The world will find out tomorrow. I am. I'm terrified. But once it passes by, it won't be a big deal. Think about it. It's not like I committed a sin. What are you doing after the collaboration competition? Why? Don't make any plans. Let's celebrate since we're going to win. Okay. I'll keep it free. It's so hot out. Eat some more of this delicious and nutritious Hanwoo beef. Jeez, I'm stuffed. STRIKE IT BIG AND PAY ME BACK, FRIEND. That's funny. This is the trend these days. It is? JANG YU-HUI THE BOLD SINGLE MOTHER, HWANG JI-AN WHAT HER DOCTOR DR. CHO SAYS ABOUT HER She did it. Madam. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. FROM SINGLE MOTHER HWANG JI-AN That ungrateful... Get rid of it! Madam... Well... I LOOK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE. FROM SINGLE MOTHER HWANG JI-AN PLEASE WISH US WELL. FROM SINGLE MOTHER HWANG JI-AN. I bought the fanciest, the best stuff from the shop. I can't wear something this flashy. I wore a tank top and miniskirt during Min-ju's custody trial, remember? You should be flashy and sexy on days like these. I'm already showing. Will it fit? What? Don't go all sappy on me. Don't let them get to you. It'll be no big deal in due time. Don't be intimidated or discouraged. Be your bold self, got it? Got it. You're blinding. How are you so dazzling this early? You'll make my heart race. You almost blinded me. Get in, Ms. Masochist. Let's go, Ankle. Good morning. - Oh my goodness! - This is huge. I had no idea. I totally called this. - No way. - Seriously, no way! This is unbelievable. Those were pregnancy signs? No freaking way! This is shocking. But if he's not the father, then who? She must have another man. Did you gossip like this when I was pregnant? That's different. You were married... What's the difference between being married or a single mom? We're all just mothers. Don't be weird in front of Ms. Hwang. And Da-in, stop crying this instant. Yes, ma'am. ZENITHS NEWS VICE PRESIDENT YEOM NA-RI This reminds me of your mother. How dare you compare them? Morning, Ms. Hwang. Did you enjoy your vacation? How have you been? Good. And the collaboration? It's being prepared without a hitch. A glass of milk, please. Yes, ma'am. Thanks. Check this out. They called nonstop after the marriage article. But not a single text after I came out as a single mother. Here, ribbon number three. It looks better in person. Did you make it yourself? Of course. I thought of you while I made it. Goodness. Tae-gang, will you excuse us? Yes, ma'am. What incredible timing. What were you thinking? Well... I realized that there's no such thing as good timing. In fact, I regret not telling everyone sooner. Are you aiming for pity votes? Who pities me? Pity is for the less fortunate. When someone's pregnant, you congratulate them. Deny it all you want. This is the reality. No one congratulates single mothers in our industry. Things are only going to get worse. Quit in style while you still can. Are you threatening me? No, I mean it... sincerely. Threat or not, your advice doesn't appeal to me. I'm grateful to you for one thing. Because you split us into two camps, I ended up creating a design that I love. If you hadn't, I would've been satisfied to stay in my comfort zone. And I already told Madam Jang that I won't be accepting the position. So stop trying so hard to fire me. Why are you doing this? Why are you throwing away your life? Just for a baby that was a mistake? It's not worth it. Throw away my life? That's a good way to put it. Life should be thrown, not chained to the ground. You didn't need to bring anything. Your presence is enough. Don't you have to work today? No, I'm off today. And you spent it coming all this way? I heard that my father called you. Oh, that? Don't give it another thought. Your father didn't seem to know that Ji-an was pregnant. I'm not so desperate to marry her off that I'd lie to him. But if they love each other... Kids these days, there's no stopping them. Of course, if you say you absolutely can't live without Ji-an, then... Here. What's this? You have a wonderful, brave daughter. Ji-an has gone public with her plans to be a single mother. THE BOLD SINGLE MOTHER, HWANG JI-AN Goodness. She needs your support more than ever, although she's already strong on her own. I see. We thought you... Never mind. We wouldn't even dare to dream. I proposed to Ji-an, but she shot me down. Without a moment of hesitation. It hurt a lot. I don't think I'll ever date again. Why did she do that? I'm sorry. It's fine, Mother. Was Mother as shy when she was young? Jeez, don't force me to say it. Goodness, it's hot. It's not easy to raise a baby without a father, am I right? Especially in this industry. She's acting very silly. They're choosing a president soon. Madam Jang won't stand for this. If she loses the competition, she'll get fired... Aren't you going back to your office? I'm an outcast, remember? Good for you. I can make patterns. How about I work here if I don't make it to the Design team? Over my dead body. - The sample is out. - Already? - Wow, it's beautiful. - Stunning. Oh, gosh. - I'm speechless. - Gorgeous. We couldn't have made something so beautiful. - Look at the detail. - The best. Poor Ms. Hwang. I saw hers in passing. The design was really nice. I'm sure her design will be good. Sir, what is this? It's completely different. Rubbish, I followed the order to the T. How can you say that? The color is dark, the lace is cheap. And the heel is all wrong. It's a completely different shoe. Whatever, I just followed the orders. Sir, this is no good. Please make it again. How can I make it again? Let's just touch it up. This can't be fixed through minor alterations. Then forget it. Sir! Damn it! I don't need anything else. Just follow the orders. How can I make this in a day? No way. I'll assist you. There's no way. Please, sir. I can't do it. This is really urgent. I have the orders, just... We're too busy. Sir, it has to be finished in a day. Can you help me out? Come on in. Sit. Dear Na-ri, you grow prettier by the day. Thank you. Anyway... How's the collaboration design? Good. I'm afraid I've been neglecting you. I want to make it up to you. Ms. Kim, bring it in. It's a painting that's perfect for you. Did you hear about Ms. Hwang? I did. What do you expect from someone of such low class? I admit it, I misjudged her gravely. Na-ri. Yes, Mother. You'll have to take over the company. Na-ri, you'll have to take over the company. What's wrong with you? Everything worked out well. Sample. It's not done... What do you mean? The other team has theirs. Ours is taking longer because it's more complicated. - Is something wrong? - No. It looks gorgeous. Then bring it here. We won't have time to fix it tomorrow. I already looked it over. Don't worry. Aren't you going home? You should go rest. For Ankle's sake. No, I want to see it for myself. Oh, your phone. Hello? Hi, Mom. What? Father, too? Stop being so lame. Dad, help me out this once. You're the only one I can turn to. Come on, Dad. I'll be in big trouble if we lose. No, you won't. She'll be in trouble. It's not that simple. Dad, please! Crazy idiot. Dad! Please. Pretty please. Do it for me, not Ms. Hwang. Then go to America. Why are you trying to send me away? I thought it over, and I finally figured it out. You have this grudge because your mother left you. So it's appealing to see this woman who won't ditch her baby. But is that love? That's just sympathy, kid. It won't last long if you stay with her out of pity! Why do you pity single parents? You should praise them. What about you? Should people have pitied you? I hate the word "pity" more than anything in the world. You just don't want me tied down and looking after someone else's kid. Don't make her a pity case when she's not! That brat. Well... I need to talk to you. Is this about the article? You saw it? You looked good in the picture. Though your skirt was a tad too short. It was not short, not compared to kids on TV these days... I'm sorry. Well, now the whole world knows. Raise the baby right, do you hear me? A lot of great men were raised by single mothers. Just raise him well, okay? Father. Child, eat up. Go on, eat. Dude, let me see. - Move over, man! - Let me see. What is it? Well? Go! What is it? It wasn't me. Someone posted it on the bulletin board as a joke. Wow, what a killer bod, no? I'd be truly blessed if I have a body like that during my full-term pregnancy. Who did it? Who? I want to give him a special bonus. Who was it? Who? Who? I'll go find out. The bulletin board is a mess. Rumors are running rampant. Hwang Ji-an was engaged to marry the doctor, but she was dumped when her dirty past came into light. The baby's father is most likely a model she met on a business trip to Italy? Of all the... It must be hard on Ms. Hwang. Now is not the time for that. Help me out here. Give it up. I'll play a tune to comfort you. Excuse me, may I have my sample? Park Tae-gang already took it. - He did? - Yes. - Good day. - You, too. Dang it. What should I do? Hey. What are you hiding? Say what? What is that? It's nothing. Nothing? So... this is how he made it. It's tomorrow. It's tomorrow. I'm sure there's a way. What way? What can we possibly do now? See you at your next check-up. Okay. PUSHY PUNK Hello? Please stop. Let go. You'll get sick. Let go. Ji-an. What's going on? She refuses to go home. I think she has a fever, too. Let me. I'm fine. Don't touch me. Please go home. Ji-an, let's go. You'll faint again. What is everyone's problem? Can't you see I'm working? Dad. Out. Get out, so I can get to work. Cut this according to the pattern. You help me with the uppers. Hurry, we only have eight hours. You should go home. The smell of the glue is bad for the baby. You know his skills. He's the Andre Kim of shoes. We've worked together for ten years. Trust us and go home. We'll make this miracle happen. Yes, leave it to them and wait at home. Go on, you're in the way! Dad, get some sleep. There's no time for sleep. Got toothpaste? - Toothpaste? - Yeah. This stuff works wonders. Yeah? Let me try. Wow, it really works! Dad, thank you so much. I'm not doing it for free. I have a condition. Go with Jake to America. Dad. Keep your promise. I trust you. Because you're my son. Get some sleep. How can I possibly sleep? At least let the baby sleep. Imagine all the stress that you heaped on Ankle today. Think about how tired Ankle must be. She could've made a shoe in there herself. Ankle is probably tired. Tell the baby it's over now. I'll go now. Get some rest. He's right. Ankle, Mommy's sorry. You must be tired. Sorry. Mommy's sorry. COLLABORATION DEADLINE D-DAY I want to call this piece a romantic armor. A romantic armor. What's with me? Come in. Are you ready? Yeah, well... Here. What is it? I refashioned them for today. What? They don't match my outfit. Come on, just wear them. All right, fine then. Give them to me. No, let me. They fit perfectly. Are you really ready? Yeah. You didn't forget about tonight, did you? What was... Let's do this. And later... Ready? Yes. Shall we go in? Subtitle translation by Jeong Lee
