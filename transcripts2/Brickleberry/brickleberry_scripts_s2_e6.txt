 I CANNOT STRESS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE WIN. - WE'RE READY TO ROCK! UH, WHAT ARE THE RANGER GAMES? - ONLY THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITION BETWEEN ALL THE WORLD'S PARK RANGERS. AH, JUST WATCH THIS. OOH, WRONG TAPE. HERE. - ON THE EVERGREEN TUNDRA OF THE WORLD'S MOST HALLOWED PARK GROUNDS, RANGERS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE GATHER TO COMPETE FOR THE COVETED GOLDEN ACORN. - GODDAMN YELLOWSTONE HAS WON THE RANGER GAMES EVERY YEAR SINCE 1908. HA HA! BUT NOW THAT BRICKLEBERRY'S BACK IN THE GAMES FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1982, THEIR REIGN IS OVER. - WHY HAVEN'T WE HAD A TEAM COMPETE SINCE 1982? - YEAH, UH, NOBODY KNOWS. - I KNOW. - THEN IN 1982 CAME THE RANGER GAMES' DARKEST DAY. BRICKLEBERRY'S WOODY JOHNSON WAS NEAR FLAWLESS IN FOREST GYMNASTICS. BUT HE WAS BEAT OUT BY 1/10TH OF A POINT BY YELLOWSTONE'S JOHN RADCLIFF. - WHAT? THIS IS HOGSHIT. AAH! [grunts] [grunts] I'M A WINNER. YOU'RE BEING PISSED ON BY A WINNER! [laughing] - AT LEAST YOU WON THE GOLD MEDAL FOR BEING A SELF-SERVING ASSHOLE. - IT'S CALLED CYCLING. - YELLOWSTONE WOULDN'T HAVE WON SHIT IF THEY'D HAVE LET BLACKS PLAY IN YOUR STUPID RANGER GAMES. INSTEAD, WE HAD TO COMPETE IN OUR NEGRO RANGER GAMES. - AH, DENZEL, STOP LIVING IN THE PAST. THE RANGER GAMES HAVE BEEN FULLY INTEGRATED SINCE 2008. SO WHAT SPORT YOU GONNA DOMINATE, HUH? RUNNING? JUMPING? WATCHING TBS? - I'M GONNA HONOR MY HERO "FROZEN TOES" CARRUTHERS, THE FIRST BLACK FIGURE SKATER, BY COMPETING IN HIS EVENT. - GOD DAMN IT! THE ONE TIME YOU COULD'VE BEEN USEFUL TO ME, AND YOU PICK THE ONE SPORT BLACK GUYS AREN'T GOOD AT. - THAT IS SO WRONG. THEY'RE ALSO BAD AT SWIMMING. - OH, BOY. OH, BOY. OH, BOY.

RIGHT AFTER I BLOW THIS ENTIRE PLACE UP! YAH! OH-HO! [all gasp] - MAGNUS IS A TERRORIST? I WAS RIGHT. YES! I TOLD YOU! IN YOUR FACE! OH, GREAT. I'M LACTATING. - STAY WHERE YOU ARE. THIS WHOLE PLACE IS LITTERED WITH BOMBS, ALL WIRED TO THIS DETONATOR IN MY SWISS ARMY KNIFE. - BUT--BUT YOU'RE SWISS.
