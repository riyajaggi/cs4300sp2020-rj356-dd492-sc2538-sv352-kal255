 BACKED OVER MY DOG, AND GAVE MY MOM TWO BLACK EYES ON HER BIRTHDAY. - THE GHOST DID ALL THAT, HUH? - YEAH, AND NOW HE'S BACK. BUT THIS TIME, I'M GONNA GET MY REVENGE AND KILL THAT DEAD SON OF A BITCH! - ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER WORD ABOUT THAT GHOST! - WOODY USED TO BE A '70s PORN STAR NAMED REX ERECTION. - TELL ME MORE ABOUT THAT GHOST, STEVE. ♪ - AH-AH-AAH! - ♪ BRICKLEBERRY - I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THIS PORN SITE WHAT?

IT WASN'T MY CHOICE. I WAS A PORNOGRAPHIC PIONEER. THE WORLD WAS AT MY FEET. I EVEN INVENTED MY OWN SIGNATURE MOVE-- THE REX ROCKET! [grunts] - OH, MY GOD! THAT WAS AMAZING! - I HAD LEGIONS OF FANS WHO ADORED ME. - COULD YOU MAKE IT OUT TO DUKE? YOU'RE MY HERO, REX. I WANT TO BE JUST LIKE YOU WHEN I GROW UP. - WHAT ARE YOU, SEVEN? - I'M ONLY SIX. - SIX INCHES? NOT ENOUGH CABLE, SON. YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT IN PORN. STAY IN SCHOOL. - OHH. - OH, I WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD, BUT I FLEW TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN. [snorts] I BURNED OUT. COULDN'T DO WHAT I, UH, NEEDED TO DO. OH, BOY. I'M--I'M REALLY EMBARRASSED ABOUT THIS, FOLKS. WELL, ONE MINUTE. OH, BROTHER. I'M THINKING OF EVERYTHING. SORRY, GUYS. I KNOW THIS SEEMS UNPROFESSIONAL, BUT MAYBE YOU GUYS CAN HIT CRAFT SERVICE. OH, OH, STARTING TO GET A TINGLE. NO! SHIT! IT'S GONE! COME ON, COME ON! MY PRESENCE IN PORN FILMS WAS REDUCED TO NON-SEXUAL CHARACTER ROLES, LIKE THE POOL BOY'S BOSS AND ONE OF THE STUDENTS NOT KEPT AFTER CLASS. IT FLUNG ME INTO A DEEP DEPRESSION. [crying] [lid pops] [crying] [snorts] HUH? WHAT ARE ALL YOU PEOPLE DOING IN MY BATHROOM? [thud] FORTUNATELY, UNCLE SAM STRAIGHTENED ME OUT. THEN I TOOK THIS JOB AT BRICKLEBERRY AND FOUND MY TRUE CALLING, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WHERE THE HELL IS EVERYBODY? YOU SEE, MALLOY, WHEN A MAN AND A WOMAN REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER, OR THEY'RE BEING PAID AND THERE'S A CAMERA THERE, THEY HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED... [spits] RELATIONS. SOMETIMES THAT WOMAN CAN BE A MAN OR A GANG OF MEN OR A SHETLAND PONY. YOU FOLLOWING ME? - YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU HAD SEX WITH A HORSE. WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME YOU WERE IN PORN? I HAVE ALWAYS DREAMED OF GETTING INTO PORN. - YOU WANT TO BE A PORN ACTOR? - HELL NO, THEY'RE DISGUSTING. I WANT TO DIRECT, LIKE THE GREAT STORYTELLERS FROM THE GOLDEN AGE OF PORN, BACK WHEN THERE WAS AN ART TO EXPLOITING PEOPLE AND RUINING THEIR LIVES. HEY, THAT REMINDS ME. PORN CON IS THIS WEEK. WE HAVE TO GO. YOU ARE A GOD TO TONS OF SAD, LONELY, PATHETIC PEOPLE. - OH, SORRY, FUZZYWUBS. I HAVE MADE MY PEACE WITH PORN, AND I'M NEVER GOING BACK TO THAT DARK PLACE. - WHAT ABOUT FOR 100 BUCKS AN AUTOGRAPH? - HELLO, DARK PLACE! - HEY--HEY, GUYS! - BREAK'S OVER. - WAIT! IT'S HERE! - WHAT'S HERE? - MY GHOST-HUNTING EQUIPMENT! - MAN, THAT'S JUST A BAT! - NO, IT'S A GHOST BAT. YOU CAN'T HIT A GHOST WITH A REGULAR BAT. IT'D GO RIGHT THROUGH THEM. GHOST TAPE RECORDER, GHOST GLASSES, GHOST-A-METER. - THAT'S A RECTAL THERMOMETER DUCT-TAPED TO A TENNIS RACQUET. STEVE, HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND ON ALL THIS CRAP? - $800. - WHAT? - SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR REVENGE, AM I RIGHT? - YEAH, UH, STEVE, THAT REMINDS ME. I HAVE THIS GHOST MOP I WANT TO SELL YOU. - NO, THANKS. ALREADY HAVE ONE. - WELL, THIS SUCKS, MALLOY. I CAN'T BELIEVE NO ONE WANTS TO MEET ME. THERE'S EVEN A LINE TO SEE THE FATTIES FROM FILIPINO FOOT FETISH 5! ♪ [camera shutter clicking] - THAT WAS A SURPRISINGLY SOLID FILM, DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS A PREQUEL TILL THE END. - I'M A JOKE. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TALKED ME INTO COMING HERE. MY LEGACY IS DEAD. - CHEER UP, WOODY. THESE PORN NERDS ARE JUST CHEAP. AUTOGRAPHS NOW ONLY $10. $1.00 AUTOGRAPHS. [thud] OKAY, NO ONE LOVES YOU. - JESUS DOES! - NOT AFTER HE SAW THE REXERECTION IV: EASTER [bleep]DAY. - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE THE BIGGEST PORN STAR IN THE WORLD, THE GOD OF ROD, THE MASTER ASS BLASTER, THE SHOO-IN FOR THIS YEAR'S BONEY AWARD, DUKE DICK!

MY ASSHOLE HAS WON FIVE BONEY AWARDS! SHOW SOME RESPECT, SON! - OH, I AIN'T YOUR SON, HOMBRE. I'M REX [bleep] ERECTION! - REX ERECTION WAS MY HERO UNTIL HE TOLD ME I'D NEVER MAKE IT. - WHAT THE-- "DEAR DUKE, YOU GOT A SMALL TOOL. STAY IN SCHOOL. REX." - WELL, I SHOWED YOU. NOW I'M ON TOP, AND YOU'RE ALL WASHED UP, OLD MAN. - NOT FOR LONG, 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO? - I DON'T KNOW. SKYPE WITH YOUR GRANDKIDS? - NO, I'M GONNA COME OUT OF RETIREMENT, I'M GONNA MAKE MY OWN MOVIE, I'M GONNA WIN THAT BONEY, AND THEN I'M GONNA SHOVE IT UP YOUR AWARD-WINNING ASSHOLE! - YEAH, RIGHT. WHAT DIRECTOR WOULD TOUCH YOUR WASHED-UP WHITE ASS? - I WILL. - DUDE, A HAIRY LITTLE WOODLAND CREATURE CAN'T DIRECT A MOVIE. - UH, WHAT ABOUT PETER JACKSON? - OKAY, I STAND CORRECTED. - ALL RIGHT, MALLOY, I SNORTED FOUR LINES OF LEVITRA. THERE'S SOUP IN THE MUSHROOM! LET'S SHOOT THIS THING! - PUT A PIN IN THAT BONER. I'M STILL AUDITIONING ACTRESSES. CONNIE, BRING THEM IN! TOO FAT, TRUCKER ARMS, FLAT ASS. THAT'S A MOOSE. CHRIST!

WHAT IS THIS NOW? - DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW DEMEANING THIS IS TO WOMEN? - YES. AND, NO, YOU CANNOT BE IN IT. - I WOULD NEVER BE IN THIS MOVIE. WAIT, WHY CAN'T I BE IN THIS MOVIE?
