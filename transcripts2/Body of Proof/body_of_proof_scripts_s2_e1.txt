 Body of Proof (2011â€“2013): Season 2, Episode 1 - Love Thy Neighbor - full transcript 
 When a car careens out of control over an embankment, killing a middle-aged man in the driver's seat, Megan learns that all is not well on a pretty suburban cul-de-sac. Looking past the perfect picket fences, she and her team are startled by the lives spinning out of control and the ever-changing suspect roster.

 (Brush crunching) Hello? Hello. Is anybody there? Aah! (Laughs) Dude, I totally had you. Jerk. You almost gave me a heart attack. Sorry I'm late. My dad almost caught me sneaking out. (Sighs) Forgive me? (Chuckles)

 (Tires screeching, clattering) Oh, my God. Run! (Grunts) (People speaking indistinctly) Hi, mom. Good morning, Lace. (Todd) Hey. Ugh. Sorry about the last-minute notice. I'll be done with my deposition in time to get her after school. It... it is no problem. Stop apologizing. I'm just happy to be here. (Chuckles) Morning, Megan.

 Kate. Bye. Bye, sweetie. So... (Sighs) uh, you want to get some breakfast? We still have a little time. I'd like to, but can you just drop me off at the school library? I've got a test today and I need to study. You didn't study last night? It's kinda hard to concentrate at the house lately. The walls are, like, paper thin. Wait. (Chuckles) What are you saying? I'm saying, I can hear the TV downstairs. What are you saying? Nothing. Nothin'. Just... mm. Nothing at all. (Whispers) Eww. (Emergency radio chatter) (Camera shutter clicking) Good morning, Peter. Good morning. What do we got? The car sailed over the embankment just before 5:00 AM. The victim's been identified as Daniel Davidson. He lives not even five minutes away. Who found him? Two teenagers snuck out here this morning to sow their burgeoning oats. Lot of that going around lately. Oh, just not with you, I take it. (Indistinct conversations) This fell out of the car when the medics opened the door. Another texting and driving accident? (Mozart's "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" playing) Oh, God. That's me. That is your ringtone? For my mother. I find the music soothes me before the inevitable onslaught. (Music stops) Damn it. (Liquid splashes) (Emergency radio chatter) Is your paresthesia acting up again? No. (Exhales) My mother is. (Radio chatter continues) (Man) We've got a vehicle tech on the way... (Speaks indistinctly) (Camera shutter clicks) Call Bud and Sam. (Morris) He already did. Ooh. Must be something pretty juicy for you to want to call homicide to a car accident. Maybe I just missed you. (Laughs) Okay. (Indistinct conversations continue) (Exhales) We've got mud on his shoes but not on the gas or brake pedal. That's weird, but not stop-the-presses weird. (Camera shutter clicks) Hmm. Seat belt's all twisted up. Seems kinda careless. Look at his arms and hands. There's no apparent compression fractures. Which he would've gotten if he'd have braced himself - before the crash. - Well, maybe he was drunk. Check this out. Thermal burn from the air bag. Right in the center of the forehead. He didn't turn away before impact, which means, he was probably unconscious. That's juicy enough for me. Somebody strapped this guy into the car and pushed him over the edge. This was no accident. (Indistinct conversations) What are you up to over there? Ah, new equipment coming in today. Gas chromatograph mass spectrometer. I know what it is, but we ain't getting a new one here. Yeah, we are. It's on its way right now. Oh, no, ma'am. Those babies cost over 100 grand a pop. That's my entire equipment budget for the year. Mm-hmm, which is why I spent months writing grant proposals and wining and dining every major benefactor in Philly. No one is touching your budget. Huh. I'm glad somebody's in bed with the right people. (Laughs) We all have our talents. What did she say? I didn't hear nothin'. Ethan. Yeah. Stop everything. I have something very important for you to do. Really? Sure. What is it? Fix my cell phone. It fell into a puddle at the crime scene. Uh, yeah. Thanks. So... (Sighs) what is your story? I did a rapid saliva test. He wasn't drunk. Right. Cell phone. That's what I should be doing. I see faint ligature marks... (Camera shutter clicks) on... both wrists... (Clicking) with a distinct pattern. No restraints were found on scene. And two abrasions on the posterior upper right arm, already healing. Also not from the accident. (Clicking) But... (Clicks) huh. A splinter. (Click) And it looks like it's got white paint on it. (Blows air) Check his left nostril. I think there's something inside. Red cloth fibers? Maybe something was held over his face to incapacitate him. Why tie him up? Good question. I gotta get a fiber analysis and a tox screen on this guy right away. Ethan. (Object clatters) Uh, right. Do you want me to do that before or after the cell phone? Before. Are you sure it was my Daniel? I'm very sorry, Mrs. Davidson. You mind telling us the last time you saw your husband? When we went to bed last night, around 11:00. But he was gone when I got up this morning. You weren't surprised when he wasn't there? No. He always went to work early to avoid the traffic. What'd your husband do? He was a C.P.A. Started at his firm the day after our honeymoon. Going on 16 years. (Voice breaks) He was always such a cautious driver. Mrs. Davidson, there's a strong possibility that someone staged the accident. How can that be? Do you know of anyone who may have wanted to hurt your husband? No. Everyone loved Daniel. All he ever did was work hard to provide for us so we could have a house like this and... "we're... we're all... we're all living the dream," he used to always say. (Crying) I'm sorry. I can't, uh... (Mrs. Davidson sniffles) (Engine whirring) (Skateboard wheels rattling) (Peter) Megan, what's wrong? I used to live on a cul-de-sac like this. Nothing is ever what it seems. Body of Proof 2x01 - Love Thy Neighbor Original air date September 20, 2011 Sync and corrected by atrn97g www.addic7ed.com I'm telling you, there's something in the air around here. I can feel it. Well, that intuition and about $7 will get you a cup of coffee. Where do you get your coffee? Little bistro down the street. A bistro? Oh, come on. Let's go see if C.S.U. has finished processing the Davidsons' car. And a cause of death wouldn't hurt. I'm all over it, detective. That is, if you can pry Peter away. (Car door closes) (Peter and woman speaking indistinctly) (Engine turns over) (Peter speaking indistinctly) Thank you. (Giggles) - What was that? - What was what? (Sexy voice) Oh, your badge... so big, so powerful. You should use that voice more often. Mm. (Laughs) Where are you going? That splinter in Daniel's arm... That's blood. Can I help you? Uh, Peter Dunlop. We're with the Medical Examiner's office. We're investigating the murder of Daniel Davidson. Heard it was just a car crash. Well, you heard wrong. Now this fence is on his property line. Would you care to explain the blood? I got into a fight with Daniel the other day. A fight about what? Son of a bitch poisoned my dog. Do you know that for a fact? He kept complaining that my dog was digging up his flower beds. Then suddenly, Skipper got real sick. Daniel denied it, - but you do the math. - Where's the dog now? The vet put him down. My kids are devastated. So, yeah, next time I saw him, we got into it. But kill him? No. Do you mind? Curtis, have you seen Megan? She's not answering her cell. She's out with Peter, Bud, and Sam. Would you just please let her know... (Elevator bell dings) I need to speak with her immediately? (Sighs) (Elevator bell dings) Hey. Kate was just looking for you, head all full of steam. Ugh. Tell her I'm on a murder case. Unh-unh. I watch telenovelas. You two ain't sticking me in the middle. This story has a tragic end with no survivors. (Indistinct conversations) (Morris) So C.S.U. found some fingertip impressions on the rear bumper of the car, caked in dirt. Right where you push a car off the road. Any ridge detail? No, just a crosshatch pattern. The killer probably wore gloves. But they also found this fancy key lodged in the driver's seat. I'll do you one better. Remember Daniel's cell phone? Yeah. There was an unsent text message on the screen. Before he died, he typed out, "I have to say something." Who was he gonna send it to? Just comes up a first name... "Vicki." And you traced the number? She's one of his neighbors. (Indistinct conversations) (School bell rings) (Indistinct conversations) (Woman speaks indistinctly) Kate? Lacey, what happened? Are you okay? I... I got sick in class. What are you doing here? Uh, your dad is in court, and your mom is... I just want to go home. (Sighs) Oh, where have you been, Casanova? You know, that woman may have had information that was pertinent to the case. Stuck in her cleavage? (Laughs) You were flirting. I was just doing my job, Megan. Mm. You're the one who seems to be fixated on sex lately. Maybe it's because my boss is having sleepovers with my ex-husband in a house with paper-thin walls. Okay, let's change the subject, shall we? What was Daniel Davidson's cause of death? Aortic transection due to the impact of the crash. But I did find something I didn't expect. What? The color of the brain is off, and the cortical surfaces are mildly depressed bilaterally. He had a leukoencephalopathy. - How'd he get that? - Not sure. The insulation of the nerves inside his brain was being destroyed. Given the demyelination, it could be M.S. or he could have a polyomavirus infection, specifically a J.C. virus. Doesn't that virus only infect people with a weakened immune system? But Daniel has never had an organ transplant. And he had no history of Hodgkin's or leukemia. There is one other possibility. (Splashes) He could be H.I.V. positive. Vicki Hemington? Yes. Bud Morris. Philly Homicide. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Daniel Davidson if you don't mind. (Exhales) It's so horrible, what happened. Daniel was such a great guy. Well, we think his accident was a result of foul play. Really? Would you mind if we took a look around, uh, inside? Oh, uh... no. Not at all. Yeah. Follow me. (Whispers) Sam. So tell me, Mrs. Hemington, did you know Daniel very well? As well as you can know a neighbor, I guess. I know this is a sensitive matter, but I have to ask. Were you two having an affair? (Man) A what? Bill, what are you doing home? Vicki, what the hell? I didn't know you were coming home for lunch. Yeah, I guess not. What's going on? Who are you? They're from the police department, honey. It's about Daniel. They say he may have been murdered. Detective Samantha Baker. You must be Bill Hemington. There's a cop in our house? We were invited in. Now you're invited out. I'm an attorney. I know our rights. Oh, Bill, her partner's here, too. Where? (Objects clatter) (Sighs) Sam, can you come in here, please? Excuse me. Guess we know who tied him up now. I just love it when suspects provide their own handcuffs, don't you? Your husband's in the other room, Mrs. Hemington, so... be honest with me. You were having an affair with Daniel Davidson. Like I told your partner... no. So the key to your S-and-M treasure trove just, uh... happened to fall into his car? No, he must have taken it by mistake. And did he also accidentally tie himself up? Oh, no, I did that. We did have sex, many... (Laughs) many, many times. Yeah, but I wouldn't call it an affair. Yes, I knew my wife was sleeping with Daniel. You did? I'm the one who set them up. I'm a very sexual person, detective. And Bill, God love him, he tried so hard to keep me happy. (Clicks tongue) But I was just getting a little bored, you know? So Bill just did what any good husband would. I threw a block party to, you know, put out some feelers. I was a little nervous at first. The neighborhood could cast us out. Almost everyone wanted in. Y... your block is full of swingers? Play couples. Oh. Play couples. Yeah. And can I tell you something? It has made my marriage stronger than ever. When's the last time you had total mind-blowing sex? 1994. Monogamy is dead, detective. So... is my murder victim. Well, I didn't kill him. Daniel was perfectly fine when he left my house this morning. And what time was that? 4:45 A.M. Bill knocked off early, and I was feeling a little restless so I called up Daniel, and he came over. And what did you do? A lot less than I would've liked. I tied him up. You know, tried to play some games. But I don't know. He just wasn't into it for some reason. (Clicks tongue) So we just ended up talking. (Inhales) Just before he died, he was going to send you a text. "I have to say something." What was that about? I don't know. Maybe he wanted to say something to his wife. I mean, he said that he wasn't into the lifestyle anymore, that it had... consequences. Consequences? What ki... what kind of consequences are you talking...? (knocking on window) Excuse me. Did I call it or what? A wife-swapping cul-de-sac. You were right. Now was that intuition, or do you have something you'd like to share with me about you and your ex? (Laughing) I'm just saying... this has piqued more than just your professional curiosity. Yeah. If it weren't for the consequences. (Bill) Yeah, a few times over the past six months or so. (Sam) And Daniel was okay with this? Of course. So? So I imagine an arrangement like that would breed a lot of jealousy. No, we had very specific rules. Sex with no secrets. Everyone plays fair, nobody gets hurt. - Did the rules always work? - Not always. Kevin Kaiser's wife left him, took the kids. She, uh, couldn't handle it. Mr. Hemington, I'm with the Medical Examiner's office. It seems that Daniel Davidson's immune system was compromised. I don't have confirmation yet, but it's possible that he was infected with H.I.V. No. Uh... no, I... I... I... I can't believe that. That was another one of our rules. Everyone gets tested, frequently. So... you didn't happen to discover Daniel was infected and kill him for exposing your wife? No. Daniel was clean. I swear to God. (Indistinct conversations) You still fretting about that dang phone? You know, I used everything in this lab to try and dry it out. You know, I even stuck it in the centrifuge. You did what now? I give up. I'm a doctor, not an engineer. (Sighs) What, are you selling stuff on eBay? Hmm. You real funny. Homicide confiscated this from a suspect in the Davidson case. Ha ha. How you like me now, Darth Vader? Who's your daddy? I don't think we saw the same "Star Wars," man. Here we go. Restraints. Let me see. Same width, same circular pattern. Looks like a match to me. Congratulations. You just proved that he liked to be tied up during sex. Ethan, I will pop you, boy. Did you find a red cloth in there? Why? 'Cause we found fibers in his nose from whatever was used to knock him out. No, nothing but leather... (Clattering) chains... ew. And some kind of gel. That's not gel. (Groans) Oh, no. Dr. Hunt. I gotta tell her about her phone. Her phone? Come on. Where's her phone? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Where's her phone? Oh, this can't be happening. Ethan. What? What are you doing?! You put it in rice? Are you crazy? - You owe me. - What is wrong with you? I owe you? What... My phone. You fixed it! Genius. Thank you. Ain't no thang. (Chimes) - Oh, God. - What? Lacey. (Imitates Yoda) Saved my butt, you did. Mm. Shut up, Ethan. What happened? Is Lacey all right? She's fine. She's fine. She threw up at school and just needed someone to pick her up. I was stuck in my depo. I... I... I called you. I called your office, your cell... I didn't get any messages. My cell was broken. Otherwise, I would've been there. I know, I know, but you weren't. So I called the next person I could think of. Right. Your girlfriend. I tried to reach you, Megan. - You didn't try hard enough. - Megan! (Clears throat) She's sleeping. She's in her room. Don't worry. Don't tell me not to worry! Megan... stop. Come on. She's fine. All right? I'll let her know you came by, all right? Just let her rest. Come on. Thank you. (Lowered voice) I'm sorry. (Sighs) (Elevator bell dings) (Sighs) Good morning. Hey, I got the, uh, blood work back on Daniel Davidson. And guess what. He didn't have H.I.V. or any other disease that would've caused the immunosuppression. Really? Yep. Then what gave him the leukoencephalopathy? Beats me, but I did find out what the cloth fibers were doused with. Brake cleaner. Why would anybody use brake cleaner to knock somebody out? Weapon of opportunity maybe? (Sighs) Daniel's neighbor across the street... he was working on his motorcycle. Call Peter. Tell him to meet me there. I wanna understand this whole swapping thing. I mean, what's the math? How many people? Is it two, three, ten? Megan, this is Kevin Kaiser, the guy whose wife left him over the whole swapping thing. That might be a little bit insensitive, don't you think? You're so square. (Laughs) (Peter) Mr. Kaiser, we're, uh, investigating the murder of Daniel Davidson. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions? Sure. What do you want to know? Uh, uh, we understand that relationships on the cul-de-sac were... complex. That's personal. What does that have to do with Daniel? Well, a lot, actually, if you were sleeping with each other's wives. We heard from one of your neighbors that it might have broken up your marriage. I, uh... I realized I was having feelings for Andrea. Unfortunately, my wife realized first. That sounds like motive to me. Your wife leaves you, and the only thing standing between you and Andrea is her husband? - No. That's not it at all. - You mind if I have a look around your garage? - It's fine. - Okay. So... um... Yeah? Never mind. (Elevator bell dings) I'm just saying, it's been too long since I've had total mind-blowing sex. Not right now, thanks. I got a caffeine headache. No red shop towels or brake cleaner laying around. Then again, I don't imagine he'd keep them after a murder. Why just limit it to him? It takes two to tango. Or three or... ten? (Morris) Seriously, Jeannie and I need to reconnect. I'm thinking date night. (Cell phone rings) I better warn that poor woman. (Ring) Baker. Go ahead, Megan. You're on speaker. So are you. Remember that guy that Bill Hemington told us about, uh, Kevin Kaiser, the one whose marriage broke up because of the lifestyle? Yeah. (Peter) It was Andrea Davidson who caused it. Uh, Kevin had feelings for her. What if the feelings were reciprocated? What if they were in it together? Bump off Daniel, pocket the life insurance money and... That would explain the cash. Wait a minute. What cash? (Sam) We ran the financials on the Davidsons. Andrea took out a cash advance on her credit card two days ago. $15,000. Vicki Hemington said that Daniel left her house at 4:45. And he went over the embankment 15 minutes later. In that time, someone had to grab him, incapacitate him, drive him out to that park, and push the car over. Tight window. So either Vicki's lying about the timeline or... Or the killer was already outside Daniel's house, laying in wait. After being paid $15,000. Our grieving widow hired a hit man. (Morris) So what did you spend the $15,000 on? You think I hired someone to kill my husband? We know couples were exchanging partners in your neighborhood, Mrs. Davidson. And that your relationship with Kevin Kaiser ended his marriage. Well, I never wanted that. (Megan) No? He told us that he had feelings for you. You didn't feel the same way? No. Never. Look, I'm not gonna lie to you. Daniel and I, we had our rough patches. But being with Kevin only made me love my husband more. Vicki Hemington told us that your husband said he wasn't even enjoying the lifestyle, that it had consequences. He said that? Well, he was right. It was all just a distraction. And that's why I took out the money. I... it was an investment in our future. How so? I was gonna buy into a time-share condo in Narantha Island, near Bermuda. You thought a time-share would save your marriage? Daniel always wanted to go somewhere tropical, and the island seemed perfect. It was a place we could have fun, learn how to be a couple again. Like everything else, it backfired, too. How? (Sighs) He found out about the money and he got really angry. I told him I'd try and get it back. Who'd you give the money to? (Sighs) Vicki. She talked to all the women on the block about it, told us to invite our female friends. She's giving a presentation at her house later today. That text message... "I have to say something." Do you think Daniel found out Vicki was trying to hide something? I would love to see that presentation, but no way we're getting back in that house, not after yesterday. - Excuse me. - She'd never allow it. Excuse me. Vicki's never met me. (Calypso music playing) Ooh, Andrea. You poor dear. So brave to still make it out today. Just know... we are all grieving. - Thank you. - Yeah. You said to bring friends, right? Mm-hmm. This is Megan. - Ooh. So nice to have you. - Thank you. Ladies, please... make yourself at home. (Music continues) Thank you. (Music continues) (Bell tinkling) Ah, yes. - Thank you. (Andrea, singsongy) - Ladies. (Chuckles) It is so great to have you all here today. (Tinkles) As a sisterhood, we all have something in common. We know an amazing opportunity when it presents itself and also possess the strength to seize it. (Sets glass down) Narantha Island... this newly discovered gem has been untouched by time or tourism. And for a small down payment, you can begin to own a piece of an all-inclusive community. I know I don't need to give you a hard sell because the proof is in the pudding. (Giggles) I'm giving each of you a chance to invest in yourselves, in your own future, to stop being dependent on your parents, your husbands, anyone. (Silverware clanks against glass) Excuse me. Hi. Hello. Sorry. I am all for financial independence but I think, first the sisterhood should first know the ingredients in the real pudding. I had my friends at the Police Department do a little research. And it turns out that Narantha Island is not so much an island per se but a landfill covered with topsoil. And as for being near Bermuda, it's actually... in the Bermuda triangle. I'm not saying that you'll disappear if you go there, but your money certainly will. Guaranteed. I imagine you already knew all that, didn't you? (Laughs) Are you kidding? Of course not. Oh. And what about Daniel Davidson? He catch on to your scheme? That's enough. Get out. I'm gonna find out the truth. But until then, you're going to pay back every cent you were given. (Sighs) (Indistinct conversations) I'm not sure when I'll be off work. (Woman) No problem. You know, we should go and grab a drink or... (Woman) - Yeah. - coffee or... I don't know. - Yeah, let's do it. - Peter! Huh? Uh... You better call me. I will. (Door closes) (Woman laughs) (Women speaking indistinctly) Wow. You certainly know how to clear a room. Ugh. You wouldn't believe it in there. What did Vicki say? It's not just her. It's all of them. It's bizarre. I mean, I... Daniel's just been murdered, and... and they act like nothing's going on. This is really affecting you, huh? What? I'm not crying. Yes, you are. (Chuckles) (Women continue speaking indistinctly) Where's your kit? You have your kit? (Sighs) What are you doing? Those vials are for evidence, you know? Exactly. What, you honestly think the answer to solving this case is in your tears? Actually, I do. I have to say, this goes above and beyond even for you, doctor. (Sighs) Actually using taxpayer dollars to test your own tears just to disprove the fact that you cried. I was not crying, detective. Believe me, you will know when I'm crying. Uh-huh. Sure you weren't. Everyone of those women at the presentation got all teary-eyed for no reason whatsoever, and then I did. That's called being a woman. Scientists proved that thousands of years ago. - Oh! (Ethan) - Hey. Here's the tox report you ordered on your... uh, lacrimal fluids. This can't be right. It's negative. Can we go back to solving a murder now? Ethan, could you please get me a PH test strip and the collection vial? Right away. (Clears throat) This... this horse is dead, you know? (Laughs) I knew it. That thing test insanity? It tests acidity. The normal PH of human tears is around 7. Mine is at a 4, which means that everyone at the Hemington house was exposed to a volatile acidic compound which affected all of our mucus membranes. I need to see the slides of Daniel Davidson's brain. It turns out, there actually is something in the air. Ah. So... Daniel did have spongiform regions in his subcortical white matter, which means he was suffering from a leukoencephalopathy like I thought, but this was toxin-induced. Toxin-induced? Like from the brake cleaner he was incapacitated with? No, that was an acute exposure. This would be chronic. Absorbed over a period of months maybe. So what was he exposed to? (Sighs) We'll have to check his liver and blood to find out, and that is not a normal tox report. - Farming it out is gonna take days. - No, it won't. - Why don't we just use our new mass spec? - You're funny. Oh, my God. Do I know something that you don't know? (Laughs) We don't have a new mass spec. Yes, we do have a new mass spec. It was delivered yesterday. It was set up. It's ready to go. Dr. Kate Murphy to the rescue. Huh. Hi, Lace. It's me again. I hope you're feeling better. And I hope you know that I wasn't avoiding your calls yesterday. I'm gonna come by after work, okay? Love you. (Knock on door) This a bad time? When Lacey was 7, she got these skates that she loved. She used to... go up and down the street for hours. I'd watch her. And one day she, um... she hit a rock, she tripped, and she skinned her knees. I carried her into the house, fixed her up, and just held her until she calmed down. And she looked up at me... smiled... and I felt something that I had never felt before. I was her hero. I've done nothing but disappoint her ever since. Yesterday, you were her hero. Megan, Todd asked for my help and I gave it. That's all. And I tried to get ahold of you numerous times. My phone was broken. You... you could've tried Peter. You know, I have a job to do, too. And if you think for a minute that I want to get in the middle of whatever family drama you've got on tap for the day... Come on! That is not fair. No, what's not fair is you playing me off as a bad guy for helping your daughter just because you're desperate to buy back a moment with her. All right? It's not my responsibility. Okay? It's yours. I'm telling you, telenovelas, ain't no survivors. What is it, Curtis? Got the report you needed from the new mass spec... Daniel Davidson's liver and blood. There's definitely a toxin running through his system. There's a spike in the area of the volatiles, characteristic of... toluene. That's a hydrocarbon. Nasty stuff. Found in gasoline, acrylics, and paint thinners among others. So Daniel was suffering from toluene toxicity. That is what caused the leukoencephalopathy. That whole neighborhood is being exposed to poison. And it could be killing all of them. (Sirens wailing) (Tires squealing) (Wailing continues) (Police radio chatter) Fan out! Fan out! We need to evacuate every single house in this neighborhood. And until we find the source of those chemicals, proceed with caution. (Wailing continues) (Man) Take your team around back! (Man) Somebody knock on this door. (Man) And I got a guest house. (Police radio chatter) Mr. Kaiser. (Radio chatter continues) (Officers shouting indistinctly) Philly P.D. (Man) Check the garage. (Man) And across the street! (Morris) Anybody home? - Hey, Bud. - What? Look at these flowers in front. Yeah? Yeah, now check out these over on the side. They're the exact same flowers, but they're turning green. They're a different color. So? When anhydrous ammonia escapes into the air, it can change the color of flowers to green. Somebody's cooking meth around here. That's what the neighbors have been breathing in. (Man) All right. Let's go! (Police radio chatter) (Officers shouting indistinctly) Philly P.D.! Hands in the air, Kaiser! In the air. Higher. Get on your knees. Lace your hands behind your head. Get on your knees! Now! We found the red shop towel you used to incapacitate Daniel Davidson. And the pattern on your gloves matches the ones we found on the rear bumper of his car. It's time to come clean, Kevin. (Grunts) I, um... I lost my job a year ago. And, uh... (Inhales deeply) (Exhales) I couldn't get hired anywhere. We were deep in debt, and I just... (Sighs) unraveled. Quite a leap to meth manufacturing. One of my cousins used to be a dealer. He told me I could get out of the hole I was in by cooking meth. I thought maybe if I could right myself, I... I could get things back to the way they used to be. How did Daniel find out? It was so early in the morning, I... I... I never expected anyone to hear me. But he was coming home from Vicki's house. Suddenly, he was just there in the shed, asking me what the hell I was doing. Are you aware that the waste product from your meth lab has contaminated the air and soil of the entire neighborhood? It's already killed your neighbor's dog. If Daniel hadn't found out... how many people would've been next? So you got the drop on Daniel with the shop cloth and... I, um... I took his car out into the woods, and, um... I pushed it over. (Voice breaks) I just, uh... (Sniffles) (Exhales) I couldn't have anything else taken away from me. (Indistinct conversations) Oh-ho. I just heard. A meth lab? What do you want, Ethan? Well, if you're going back to the police station, could you return these for me? Oh. Ooh. (Laughs) (Elevator bell dings) You might want to hold on to that one. (Purrs) (Peter) No, I don't bust out the toys until, you know, the second date. (Chuckles) Ohh. (Clenched teeth) I thought you were being professional. I am, but now it's personal. (Indistinct conversations continue) Any houses for rent in this cul-de-sac? (Normal voice) You couldn't handle a desperate housewife. Believe me. (Indistinct conversations continue) (Knock on door) Come in. Mom. Hi. How you feelin'? I'm... better. I hope you know that, um...

I'm happy to be here, and... and not just for, uh, shopping and movies and... I mean, that's all great, but... Mom! I know. I promise. Look, it's my own fault anyway. I mean, I probably just... something I ate or whatever. You weren't sick, were you? What? Yeah. I... How did you know? (Laughs) Uh... because I'm your mother. Wow. That is beautiful. Did you do this? Yeah. Wow. I love art. So why'd you lie? Hmm? â™ª I didn't want to have to take my science test because I knew I was going to fail. I just don't get it.
