   Wow, you're so lucky! Your Quirk is amazing, Kacchan. When I get mine, I hope it's just as cool! Whatever, Deku. No matter what power you end up with, you'll never be able to beat me. [KATSUKI] He's just a little bug. Until the exam, he was nothing. A little bug I could crush if I wanted to. [KATSUKI] So where's that flashy power a' yours now? [KATSUKI] Dammit! You were tricking me for years by acting weak. Bet you've been laughing behind my back, huh?! [KATSUKI] Let's see how your power compares to mine. Quirk or no, you'll never beat me, Deku! [KATSUKI gasps] [TENYA] What's happening? Improvised special move: the Comet Home Run! [TENYA] In the name of villainy, stop this! I've got it! [TENYA gasps] So this was your big plan. [IZUKU] I wasn't... going to use it. [grunts] [IZUKU whimpers] Because I can't control it. My body just can't handle... ...the backlash of my power yet. Mr. Aizawa said I'd be useless. But this was all... that I... could think of. [KATSUKI gasps] This is the only way... I had any chance at winning. [KATSUKI grunts] [IZUKU] Someone I look up to told me... [IZUKU] ...that I can become a hero. [IZUKU] That's why I applied. Like it or not, you can't stop me! [ALL MIGHT] Your indoor combat training is over. ‐‐[groans] ‐‐[TENYA gasps] [TENYA] Are you okay? [ALL MIGHT] The hero team wins! [STUDENTS gasping] [KAMINARI] What a weird way for this to end. The losers are practically untouched. and the winners are both on the ground. How does the old saying go? They may've lost the battle, but they won the war. This class is intense. [TRANSPO‐BOT A] To the nurse's office. [TRANSPO‐BOT B] I know. [KATSUKI] My attacks... ...Deku predicted them. He made me look like an idiot. And somehow managed to win the exercise. [IZUKU] You've always been stronger, Kacchan. Can't you see? That's why I wanna beat you! Because you're amazing! [KATSUKI] Does this mean that if we really fought... ...if we didn't hold back at all... ...Deku would beat me with his Quirk? Young Bakugo. Cool your jets. Let's go review your work. Whether you win or lose, you can always take something away from an experience like this. As long as you're open to learning. [ALL MIGHT] Well, despite the results. The MVP of this exercise is Young Iida! [STUDENTS gasp] Huh?! Shouldn't it be one of the heroes instead, since they're the winners? [ALL MIGHT] Mm! Valid question. Why didn't I choose one of those two? Who has a guess? Sir! I can tell you why! Iida embraced this challenge. He was the only one who truly adapted to his assigned role. I'll explain. Bakugo's judgment was clouded by a personal grudge against Midoriya. As you pointed out earlier, launching a large‐scale attack indoors was a foolish move. It could have been disastrous. Similarly, Midoriya's plan was also poorly thought out, considering the amount of damage that he received. He rendered himself helpless. Not smart. As for Uraraka... She let her guard down mid‐battle, and her final attack was far too reckless given the hypothetical stakes. If she'd treated the fake weapon as though it were real, she never would've risked using such an imprecise move. Iida was fully prepared for his opponent's arrival. He had a strategy, and never lost sight of his mission to protect the dummy weapon, even if he was foiled in the end. Technically, the hero team won, yes, but they took advantage of the fact that this was training. They didn't respect the spirit of the trial. [ALL MIGHT grunts] This girl really has a good eye on her. Yes... Well, you overlooked a few things. Young Iida could have relaxed a little bit in the exercise, but... otherwise, you nailed it! [YAOYOROZU] One should always start with the basics and devote themselves wholeheartedly to learning. That's the only real way to become a top hero. [PRESENT MIC] Momo Yaoyorozu: One of the four students admitted to the hero course based on recommendations. Now then. Time to blow this joint. Let's move on to the next match! Think about everything we saw and discussed as you tackle this training for yourself. [STUDENTS] Yes, sir! [ALL MIGHT] Match two! Team B will be our heroes! And Team I will be the villains! [HAGAKURE] Hey, Ojiro. Huh? [HAGAKURE] Let's get serious. I'm gonna take off all my clothes and totally disappear. Yeah. Cool. [OJIRO] Hagakure's using her Quirk to our advantage, but it's kinda weird to know there's a naked girl standing by me. What exactly am I supposed to do here? [HAGAKURE] Uh... Just don't look, okay? [OJIRO] What's the difference? Look alive, kids! Show us you're the embodiment of good. Or evil! Let's go! [buzzer blares] [PRESENT MIC] Mezo Shoji, Quirk: Dupli‐Arms! He can replicate different body parts on the tips of his tentacles! Now that's super strange! One's in the hall on the north side of the fourth floor. And I think the other's on the same level somewhere. Both are barefoot. I bet the invisible one plans to sneak up and surprise us. For your own safety, go outside. I'm sure our opponents intend to fight a defensive battle. But we've already won. [SHOJI gasps] [HAGAKURE] Ow, ow, ow! My feet are stuck! This Quirk is insane. [footsteps crunching] [grunts] [TODOROKI] Pry yourself up if you want, but it might be hard to fight me with no skin on the bottom of your feet. [shivering] He incapacitated them without compromising the weapon or his teammate. Take close note of his technique, students. [KIRISHIMA] Whoa, he's so strong! [ALL MIGHT] The hero team wins! [OJIRO gasps] Heat, too? [HAGAKURE whimpers] Ow, ow, ow! [TODOROKI] It's not your fault. We're just playing on different levels. [PRESENT MIC] Shoto Todoroki. Another of the four admitted to the hero course based on recommendations. Quirk: Half‐Cold, Half‐Hot! He freezes with his right side and burns up the charts with his left. The range of his abilities is unknown! [gasps] Holy crap! That guy's kind of intimidating. He got in on a recommendation, so he must be good. [ALL MIGHT] Moving on! Time to gather 'round for a review of the second match. After that, we'll jet on over to our next battle! [STUDENTS] Yes, sir! [grunts] [chuckles] [MINETA laughs nervously] [grunts] Surf's up! ‐‐[ASHIDO giggles] ‐‐[AOYAMA groans] Oops! My bad. [whistle blows] That's a wrap! Super work. You really stepped up to the plate. And, we didn't have any major injuries, except for Midoriya. You should be proud. Excellent first day of training, all around! It's nice to hear some encouraging words after our homeroom class. Mr. Aizawa was kind of a buzzkill. I'm happy to bring such staggering positivity to my alma mater! That's all for now, folks. I should go and check on Young Midoriya's progress! Now, watch how a pro exits. Like he's got somewhere to be! [STUDENTS gasp] Okay, you guys, that is a hero! Aw, I'll never be able to run that fast. [MINETA] Super awesome! [ALL MIGHT] Young Bakugo really is overflowing with pride. His ego may be justified, but a school like UA is bound to shatter it. As his teacher, it's my sworn duty to counsel him well. But it'll have to wait. [coughs] [panting] [ALL MIGHT] I can't hold this form any longer. [panting] [ALL MIGHT] I barely have enough time to teach a class. Shit. [RECOVERY GIRL] The second day of school and he's already a regular patient. Why didn't you stop him, All Might? [ALL MIGHT] You're right, Recovery Girl. I'm sorry. Well, it's no good apologizing to me! He's too exhausted from his classes for my Quirk. I can't treat all his injuries at once. I did some first aid, but after the IV is finished, we'll have to wait for his body to heal overnight. Come on, All Might. I know you passed your powers on to this boy, but you can't spoil him. I am trying not to play favorites. I wanted to consider his feelings, though. He needed to see that he was capable of winning the exercise. Oh, yeah. Also. Will you please not talk so loudly 'bout One For All when anyone around you could hear? Yeah, yeah, I know, Mr. Natural‐Born Hero. Mr. Symbol of Peace. [ALL MIGHT sighs] Several people know about my injury and this weak form. Like the UA faculty and a certain group of pro heroes, for example. However, only a select few people know the secret of One For All. There's you, the principal, and a very close friend of mine. Young Midoriya, too, of course, but no one else knows the truth about my powers. [RECOVERY GIRL] You're the number‐one hero in the world, All Might. Does it really matter if you were born with your Quirk or not? Do you have to be the "Symbol of Peace?" Is it that important? If they knew I wasn't, the temptation of this power could corrupt our society. This Quirk... Those who wield it are responsible for mankind's safety. [sighs] Well, if that's the case, it's even more important for you to be a good guide. [ALL MIGHT] You're right. Young man. You, too, can become a hero. Listen well, young man. This is your choice. One For All. [IZUKU] Smash! Welcome, Young Midoriya. You're now going to be a part of the hero academia! [IZUKU] I've still got a whole lot to learn if I'm gonna achieve my dream! [IZUKU grunts] You can call me Deku, but I'm not the same helpless kid anymore! I've changed. You hear me? From now on, Deku is the name of a hero! [IZUKU] It's... late afternoon? Rise and shine, sonny. [gasps] [RECOVERY GIRL] That's all for today's treatment. Come back tomorrow, okay? [IZUKU] I missed all my afternoon classes. Mr. Aizawa's probably gonna choke me with his scarf. Hey, it's Midoriya! ‐‐Good to see ya back, super! ‐‐[gasps] Ha! Man, I don't know what you were saying during that match. But you were all fired up, huh? I can't believe you held your own against Bakugo‐‐ He's super strong! You did a great job dodging! You guys really turned up in the first match, so none of us held back in our rounds, either! You were far from elegant, but I suppose‐‐ And the dodging was like, whoa! [gasps] Hey, I'm Eijiro Kirishima. We've been goin' over training results while you were in recovery. Hi. I'm Hanta Sero. [AOYAMA] More importantly, I'm Yuga Ao‐‐ I'm Mina Ashido! And I just gotta say, your dodging was awesome! Tsuyu Asui. But please, call me "Tsu." Hey, Sato. Um. Hey, guys. And my name's Mineta! [KIRISHIMA] Where the heck did you pop out of? [AOYAMA] UA's shiniest star here‐‐ [SATO] You might sparkle, but you sucked it up intraining. So noisy. Tokoyami! Stop using that desk as a chair! Get off of it this instant! Dude, you need to chill. Uh‐‐ You're carrying a lot of tension. [TENYA] No one understands. I cannot condone actions that disrespect these desks. Not when great men and women, our upperclassmen, once used them! [TOKOYAMI] Also noisy. [IZUKU] Iida never relaxes, does he? So, anyway, wanna grab a bite sometime? Kinda stuff you like? Anything sweet... Hey, Deku! Why didn't she heal your injuries? Oh. Uh... Well it has to do with how much stamina I'm using. [OCHACO] Stamina? [gasps] [IZUKU] Um, Uraraka. Where's Kacchan? [IZUKU panting] [OCHACO] We tried to stop him from leaving. But he wouldn't listen. You just missed him. [KATSUKI] Dammit! You were tricking me for years by acting weak. Bet you've been laughing behind my back, huh? [KATSUKI] So where's that flashy power a' yours now? Kacchan! [IZUKU] Wait up! What? [gasps] [IZUKU] I haven't told anyone this secret. Not even my mom. [IZUKU] I have to tell you something. Maybe then, you'll understand what's been going on. [IZUKU] I wasn't hiding my Quirk from you. It was given to me by someone else. Recently. [KATSUKI grunts] [IZUKU] But I can't tell you who I got it from, so don't ask! Sounds crazy, I know. It's like something out of a comic book. Only, it's real. The thing is, I don't really have any control over this power yet. I haven't figured out how to make it my own, but I'm trying. That's why... ...I didn't wanna use it against you in the exercise. But in the end, it was the only way that I had a chance of winning. I've still got a lot to learn. I know that. That's why I'm here. [IZUKU] You'll see. I'll work until I have full control of this borrowed Quirk. And I'll finally beat you with my own power! [IZUKU gasps] [IZUKU] Oh, crap, what am I saying? I only meant to tell him that I wasn't tricking him! [KATSUKI] How dumb do you think I am? [gasps] "Borrowed power"? Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot. You already made a fool outta me in that damn training exercise. So? Did you come here to rub it in? I lost. And to make matters worse, it was to you. I came in first in the exam, but that's not enough. [KATSUKI] When I was watching that ice guy, I realized I couldn't beat him in a head‐to‐head fight. Launching a large‐scale attack indoors was a foolish move. Crap! I even agreed with what that girl said. My attack was so stupid! Damn it! Damn it, damn it, damn it! Enjoy that win, Deku. You won't get another! I'm just getting started! Got that?! I'm gonna end up the number‐one hero, no matter what! [IZUKU grunts] [KATSUKI] You'll never beat me again, you bastard. Don't even try. [sighs] [ALL MIGHT] There you are! Bakugo! I found you! [ALL MIGHT pants] Just so you know, pride is an important attribute to have. But while you certainly have the abilities to become a pro hero, there's still plenty you have to learn! [KATSUKI] Let go of me, All Might. Right now. [ALL MIGHT] Hm? Save your speeches. I'll be more famous than you, and I'll do it without your help. [ALL MIGHT] Uh‐‐ Uh... Right. [ALL MIGHT] I guess he's already over it. [ALL MIGHT] Man. Being a teacher is hard. Huh, I wonder what that was all about. The fated battle between rivals. Whatever Midoriya was saying, it looked like Bakugo really wanted to punch him. Childhood friends turned enemies! [IZUKU] Kacchan's fuse has been lit. There's a fire under him. But that doesn't change what I have to do. I'll keep chasing after him. [ALL MIGHT] Midoriya! What were you saying to Bakugo before I arrived so heroically? Ah! Oh, nothing special. [ALL MIGHT] Hmm. I'm so curious. Why don't you tell me all the juicy details? [IZUKU] Um, actually, I kinda forgot? [IZUKU] None of us were prepared for what was to come. All Might warned us about cunning villains. And a few days later, we learned firsthand how terrifying they could actually be. [SHIGARAKI] Did you see this joke? It says he's a teacher now. [SHIGARAKI] Hey. What do you think'll happen when the mighty Symbol of Peace... [SHIGARAKI] ...is finally killed by the villains? [ALL MIGHT] All heroes have an origin! [IZUKU] Next time: "Yeah, Just Do Your Best, Iida!" [ALL MIGHT] A lot weird stuff happens and Young Midoriya goes crowd surfing! He's not very good at it. [IZUKU] Go beyo‐‐ Hey, you're crushing me! [IZUKU, ALL MIGHT] Plus Ultra!
