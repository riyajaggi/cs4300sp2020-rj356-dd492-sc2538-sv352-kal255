   [ALL MIGHT laughs] [IZUKU gasps] Fear not, citizens. Hope has arrived. Because I am here. [yells] He's the coolest in the universe! And once I get my Quirk, I'm gonna be a hero, just like him! Sorry, kid, It's not gonna happen. [IZUKU] Even if I'll never have superpowers... You're worse than the rest of these rejects, you Quirkless wannabe. Do you really think they'd let someone like you in when they could have me? You'd never be able to hang with the best of the best. [IZUKU] Even if everyone thinks I'm useless... [IZUKU'S MOM] I'm sorry, Izuku. I wish things were different. [IZUKU'S MOM sobs] [IZUKU] Mom. That's not what I needed you to say. Couldn't you see? Despite everything, I still dream. And I have to know. Is it possible to become a hero, even if I don't have a Quirk? [IZUKU] I'm a normal kid without any powers. Could I ever hope to be someone like you? [IZUKU whimpers] Without a Quirk? [grunts] [ALL MIGHT grunting, groaning] [ALL MIGHT] Oh, no. Not now, dammit! Not here! People think I don't have a chance. That not having any powers makes me some kinda weakling. My classmates like to make fun of me. But you know what? That makes me wanna prove them wrong. Ever since I was a kid, I've thought that saving people is the coolest thing you can do. I want people to see my fearless smile and feel safe. And be the kind of hero everyone in the world looks up to. Just like you! [IZUKU yelps] [IZUKU screams] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn [CROWD chattering] [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A grunting] [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A] Where am I? What happened? [ALL MIGHT] Texas... [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A] Oh, yeah. That bastard. [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A] If it wasn't for him, I'd be out of town already. [FRIEND 1B] That was rough. Weren't you and Midoriya good friends back when you were kids? Yeah, you were a little harsh with him today. It's his own fault for gettin' in my way. [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A yelps] You shouldn't waste your time on the guy. It's just that... I've wanted to be a hero since I was a little kid. I may not have a Quirk, but I can still try my hardest, can't I? Someone's gotta teach that worthless nerd how the world really works. I hate it when he talks heroes. [FRIENDS chuckle] [FRIEND 1B] Hey, I got an idea, we should go to the Arcade. Get your mind off it, ya know? Fine. [FRIEND 1A] Or we can sneak into the bar at the station. Pick up some ladies. Now that's a good idea. Idiots! If we get caught, there's no way UA would let me in. [FRIENDS] Hey, what's that? [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A] Perfect. I like a skin suit with some fire. [IZUKU screams] [IZUKU] I‐‐ Wait. Who...? What happened, you deflated! Ah! Where'd All Might go? You! You're not him. You're a fake! An imposter! [sighs] I assure you that I am All M‐‐ [screams] Impossible! [ALL MIGHT] You know how guys at the pool are always suckin' in and flexin' and tryin' look buff? I'm like that. This can't be real! No. I'm dreaming. All Might's a giant of a man who saves everyone. He defeats all obstacles, and wins the day with a fearless smile. [sighs] There's plenty of fear behind that smile. I'm counting on you to keep your mouth shut. Don't go talking about this online or telling your friends. ‐‐Huh...? ‐‐[clothes rustling] [gasps] Pretty gross, right? I got this in a big fight five years back. My respiratory system was basically destroyed. I lost my whole stomach. All the surgeries have pretty much worn me out. And it can't be fixed. Right now, I can only do hero work for about three hours a day. Rest of the time, this is what I look like. [gasps] No way... Five years ago? So does that mean it was the fight with Toxic Chainsaw? Wow, you know your stuff. But no. The punk may've landed some hits, but he couldn't bring me down. Most of the world has never heard of this fight. I did everything I could to keep it under wraps. I'm supposed to be the guy who's always smiling, right? I'm the Symbol of Peace. People everywhere have to think that I'm never afraid. But honestly, I smile to hide the fear inside. It's just a brave face I put on when the pressure is high. This job isn't easy. [gasps] Pro heroes are always having to risk their lives. Some villains just can't be beaten without powers. So, can you be a hero? Not without a Quirk. [gasping] I see... If you wanna help people, there are plenty other ways to do it. You could become a police officer. They get crap because the heroes capture most of the villains. But it's a fine profession. [door clicks] [ALL MIGHT] It's not bad to have a dream, young man. Just, make sure your dreams are attainable. Realistic. Understand? [ALL MIGHT coughing] Now, let's get you to the station. [gasps] [distant rumbling] [ALL MIGHT] Not good. [distant rumbling] [IZUKU gasps] [gasps] A villain! I wonder which hero will show. Some villains just can't be beaten without powers. So, can you be a hero? Not without a Quirk. [sighs] [panting] [SHOPPERS screaming] [WOMAN 2A] It's a monster! [HEROS gasp] [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A grunting] [DEATH ARMS] It's taken someone hostage! How dare you prey on a child! [DEATH ARMS grunts] [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A grunts] [DEATH ARMS] What the hell is this? Some kinda goo. [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A yells] [DEATH ARMS groans] You okay, Death Arms?! [BASEBALL HERO 2A] Heads up! [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A yells] Ha! Stay back, or I'll snap his neck! [KATSUKI grunting] [yells] [KATSUKI] You picked the wrong guy to mess with. I'm gonna send you back to whatever sewer you crawled out of! Let me go! [DEATH ARMS grunts] [HERO 2A, BASEBALL HERO 2A grunting] [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A] You've got so much power. I really hit the jackpot. With a Quirk like yours under my control, I can take All Might down with one punch. [gasps] [ONLOOKER 2A] Whoa, is that some kinda special move? This dude is a legit supervillain. [ONLOOKERS gasp] It's her! That new hero, Mt. Lady will stop him! [gasps] My only weakness! I need at least a two lane road if I'm gonna make my way through here. [FRIENDS whimpering] [FRIENDS yelp] [KAMUI WOODS] Fire and wood don't exactly make a good combination. I'll let someone else stop this guy. [BACKDRAFT] Don't look at me. I've got my hands full here. Where are those fire trucks? Can you guys get to him? Can't get a grip on his weird body. Plus, that kid's Quirk's causing explosions left and right. [BASEBALL HERO 2A] This is a shutout. We've gotta rally and knock him outta the park somehow. [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A cackling] [grunts] [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A grunts] [BASEBALL HERO 2A] Incoming! [DEATH ARMS] It's no good. None of us have the right Quirks to stop a villain like this! [HERO 2A] We'll do damage control until someone with the right powers shows up. [BACKDRAFT] There are still plenty of people to save. [KAMUI WOODS] Don't worry, I bet every hero in the city's coming. [DEATH ARMS] I'm sorry, kid. You'll just have to hold on a little bit longer. Damn! If I only had more power, I could blow this guy away. [ONLOOKER 2A] Um, this looks bad. Maybe we should run? [ONLOOKER 2C] C'mon heroes, you've got this! [gasps] [ALL MIGHT] Must've dropped him in the air. I was distracted, worrying about my time limit. I can't believe I made such a rookie mistake, and after lecturing that kid about what it takes to be a hero. I'm pathetic. [FRIEND 1A] He'll never be a hero. Better to find out now instead of later, I guess. [ALL MIGHT] Make sure your dreams are attainable. [IZUKU sighs] [IZUKU] Even All Might said it. A hero needs a Quirk. Don't cry, dammit. Deep down, you knew this all along. You've just been avoiding reality. That's why you were trying so desperately to prove yourself wrong. [rumbling] [gasps] [IZUKU] That's strange. Is the fight from earlier still going on? Why am I here? Did I subconsciously walk this way to check it out? I shouldn't even stop. All my notes are useless. [gasps] [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A yelling] [IZUKU] That's the guy who attacked me! [gasps] [IZUKU] That can't be right. All Might captured him. [IZUKU] But the bottle... If he dropped it... That means... It's my fault. Why aren't the heroes doing anything? [ONLOOKER 2E] It looks like they've met their match. Plus, the villain captured a kid. Things aren't looking good for him. [gasps] [IZUKU] He caught someone? I wonder how long they've been in there. How can they survive being suffocated like that? I thought I'd die after only a few seconds of struggling. [IZUKU] Oh, man. [ONLOOKER 2F] Wait, I'm confused. Isn't that the villain All Might was chasing earlier today? [IZUKU gasps] What? All Might?! No way he lost, where is he? Well, can someone call him or something? ‐‐[ALL MIGHT gasps] ‐‐Seriously! Why hasn't he shown up to help the heroes? [ALL MIGHT groans] [IZUKU whimpers] [IZUKU] I'm the one to blame. He wasted his energy on me. [ALL MIGHT] I'm worthless. [IZUKU] He can't power up yet. And none of the other heroes have the Quirks to stop this monster. [ALL MIGHT] So pathetic... [IZUKU] It's my fault. I'm sorry. So sorry. [ALL MIGHT] A disgrace. [IZUKU] Help will show up and save the day, I'm sure. [ALL MIGHT] I'm not a real hero. [IZUKU] Someone... A real hero will come soon. [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A growling] [KATSUKI grunting] [IZUKU gasps] [IZUKU grunts] [ALL MIGHT grunts] [HEROS gasp] [IZUKU panting, grunting] No, you idiot! Stop! You're gonna get yourself killed! [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A] Not this brat again. [KATSUKI] Deku? [IZUKU] What am I doing? Why am I running? Why can't I stop? [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A] You're toast, kid! [IZUKU panting] [IZUKU] What do I do? What would a hero do right now? Page 25! Right! [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A grunts] [IZUKU] Take this! [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A grunts, groans] [gasps, coughs] Kacchan! [IZUKU grunting] What the hell? Why are you here? I dunno. My legs... They just started... moving! [KATSUKI grunts] [IZUKU grunts] [IZUKU] I don't know why I did what I did. ‐‐[DOCTOR 1A] Sorry, kid... ‐‐[IZUKU] I'm the one to blame. [KATSUKI] You really think they'd let someone like you... [IZUKU] He's the coolest in the universe! Kacchan! ‐‐I've wanted to be a hero... ‐‐[ALL MIGHT] I honestly don't think you can become a hero... [IZUKU] There's always a smile on his face... Maybe it was the look on his face. Kacchan! I couldn't just stand there and watch you die! [ALL MIGHT grunts] [KATSUKI] Get the hell off me! [ALL MIGHT] I have to do something. No matter the cost. [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A] Just a little bit longer, kid. And I'm done playing with you! [DEATH ARMS] Save the boy! This thing'll kill him! [IZUKU grunting] [ALL MIGHT] I really am pathetic. [gasps] All Might. But... I told you the traits that make a great champion, But I see now I wasn't living up to my own ideal. Pros are always risking their lives! That's the true test of a hero! [SLUDGE VILLAIN 1A] Damn you, All Might! [ALL MIGHT] Detroit... Smash! [MT. LADY grunts] [HEROS grunting] [ALL MIGHT panting] Huh? It's raining. [ONLOOKER 2G] Don't tell me all that wind just now was... [ONLOOKER 2J] Look at the clouds. They're moving! [DEATH ARMS] Holy crap. He changed the weather. [ONLOOKER 2K] Did that really just happen? [CROWD cheers] [ONLOOKER 2J] He changed the weather with a single punch, like it was nothing! All Might saved the day again, he's amazing! [CROWD cheers] [IZUKU] After that, the heroes collected all the scattered mounds of sludge. And the villain went into police custody where he belonged. [KAMUI WOODS] You moron. Do you have a death wish? [DEATH ARMS] There was absolutely no reason for you to put yourself in danger like that! [IZUKU] I got chewed out by the heroes, big time. While Kacchan was praised for his bravery. Man, you're tough, kid! And that Quirk is somethin' else! When you wanna go pro, head over to my agency first! I'd love for you to be my sidekick while you're training! [IZUKU] I wanted to apologize to All Might, but he was swarmed by interviewers. I didn't wanna interrupt. I can always try to send a message through his website when I get home. [KATSUKI] Deku! [gasps] Kacchan? [pants] Listen. I would never ask for a weakling like you to help me. Don't think you can look down on me. Huh? Got that? I was fine by myself. You're just a Quirkless failure who won't even cut it as a rent‐a‐cop. You didn't help me. You did nothing. Don't forget it. I don't owe you anything! [IZUKU] What was that? [IZUKU] Kacchan is right, though. It's not like I actually did anything to help today. But... At least I tried. Guess now I should get back to giving up on my dreams. I am here! [IZUKU screams] All Might! Where'd you come from? Uh, how'd you get rid of all those reporters? [laughs] I stand for justice! Not soundbites! Because I‐‐ I am All Mi‐‐ [IZUKU screams] [ALL MIGHT coughs] Young man. I came here to thank you. And also to discuss your question from earlier. [IZUKU] Huh? [ALL MIGHT] If I you hadn't told me about your life... If you hadn't run into that fight... ...I would've been a worthless bystander watching from the crowd. So thanks. Oh, no. It was my fault he was there to begin with. I got in the way of your hard work. I wasted your energy. And... not to mention your time. [ALL MIGHT] I'm not done. You told me you didn't have a power. So when I saw this timid, Quirkless boy try to save a life. It inspired me to act, too. [gasps] [ALL MIGHT] There are stories about every hero. How they became great. Most have one thing in common. [ALL MIGHT] Their bodies moved before they had a chance to think. Almost on their own. [IZUKU sniffles] [IZUKU] For some reason, I remembered my mother's words in that moment. [IZUKU'S MOM] I'm sorry, Izuku. I wish things were different. [sobbing] And today, that's what happened to you. [sobbing] [IZUKU] You never told me, Mom. Back then... The thing I wanted you to say... [IZUKU] The words I needed to hear. Young man. You, too, can become a hero. [sobbing] [IZUKU] Dreams can become reality. [IZUKU] Oh, by the way. I forgot to mention that this is the story of how I became the world's greatest hero. [ALL MIGHT] Young man! I have deemed you worthy of inheriting the glorious power of All Might! [IZUKU] Wait. What do you mean inherit? [ALL MIGHT] When you're ready, you'll take my unstoppable Quirk. One For All! [IZUKU] So... It's that easy? I can become a hero, just like that? [ALL MIGHT laughs] Of course not, kid, not with that frail body of yours. [IZUKU] Huh? Next time: "Roaring Muscles!" [ALL MIGHT] Midoriya is going to be super buff by the time I'm through with him! [IZUKU] Go beyond! [ALL MIGHT, IZUKU] Plus Ultra!
