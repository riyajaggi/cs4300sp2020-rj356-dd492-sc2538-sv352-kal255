   [crying] Why are you being so mean? You're making him cry, Kacchan! If you keep on hurting him... Uhh... I'll, uhh... I'll stop you myself! You want to pretend to be a hero? You don't stand a chance without a Quirk... Deku. [sobs] [grunts] [cicadas chirping] DEKU [V/O]: Here's the sad truth... All men are not created equal. When I was four years old, I learnt that some kids have more power than others. # # But that won't hold me back... If anything, it pushes me to do better. [beeping] [gasps] [loud roar] Izuku Midoriya [gasp] That's one huge super-villain! # # Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK DEKU [V/O]: The first incident was in Keikei City [crying] An extraordinary child was born who radiated light. Papa who radiated light. [whimpering] Papa After that, reports of people with superpowers popped up across the globe. No one knew what was causing these Quirks... Before long, the supernatural became the totally normal. Dreams are reality. The world became a superhuman society with about 80% of the population possessing some uncanny ability. Our streets looked like scenes from comic books. A city swirled with chaos and confusion, a new profession dominated our collective consciousness. [loud roar] It was an age of heroes. [grunts] Oh, nice! Way to go, Deatharms. Man: The Punching Hero! I wish I had a Quirk that made me super strong! Everyone, please stay back! This area is far too dangerous! Man: Woah! The Rescue Specialist  Backdraft is here? He'll make sure we're okay. This guy must be pretty desperate to go full monster in the middle of the city. - Do you know what happened? - Just some amateur. Stole someone's bag then got himself cornered. [scoffs] A Quirk like that and he's just a petty thief I got held up, the train's out. Another villain. I'm not sure when I'm gonna make it into the office [squeals] It's Kamui!  We're your biggest fans! Get away from me or I'll break your back! Oh, this is going to be good! It's Kamui Woods! He may be new but he's making a big name of himself! Why, I look at that dopey grin and I know what you are... A fanboy! Uh... sorta... Assault, robbery, and illegal use of powers during rush hour traffic. You are the incarnation of evil! - There! His special move! - C'mon, Tree Man! Show us something flashy! The Pre-Emptive... Binding... Lacquered Chain Prison! Canyon Cannon! [all] Money shot,  money shot, money shot... Piece of cake for the world's next hottest hero. Hi there everyone, I'm Mount Lady. And you don't have to worry about this bum anymore. Money shot, money shot, money shot... [crowd cheering] What? She's getting all the credit? DEKU [V/O]: With the rise of superpowers came an explosive increase in criminal activity. While governments were stuck trying to figure out how to reform with Quirks in mind, courageous people started performing heroic acts to keep our cities safe. Protecting us against villains who abuse their powers for evil. With overwhelming public support, heroes found an official place as peacekeepers overseen by the government. Those who perform the best were paid the most and got all the fame and glory. Their careers depended on their ability to stay in the spotlight. Gigantification, huh... Well, she's definitely got the looks and attitude to be a crowd favourite and her Quirk is really showy. But it will be hard for her to get around much in the city without damaging lots of things. That means, she might not be very useful... What's that, fanboy? You're taking notes over there? Wanna be a hero too, huh? [laughs] Yes! More than anything. Episode 1 Izuku Midoriya: Origin Aldera Junior High TEACHER: So... as third-year students Aldera Junior High TEACHER: So... as third-year students it's time to start thinking seriously about your futures and what you want to do with your lives. I could pass out some career aptitude tests. But... Why bother? I know you all want to go to the Hero Track! [all cheering] Yes, yes, you've got some very impressive Quirks but no power usage allowed in school. Get a hold of yourselves... BAKUGO: Hey, teach... Don't lump me in with this bunch of losers. I'm the real deal but these guys will be lucky to end up as sidekicks to some busted D-lister. Ha! Katsuki Bakugo Ha! Katsuki Bakugo You think you're better than us, Katski?! Let's go, I'll take you all on! Huh, you've got impressive test results. Maybe you will get into U.A. High. He's gonna try for the national school?! That school has a 0.2% acceptance rate! It's impossible to get into! And that's exactly way it's the only place worthy of me. I aced all of the mock tests. I'm the only one at this school who stands a chance of getting in. I'll end up more popular than All Might himself! And be the richest hero of all time! People all across the world will know who I am and it all starts with U.A. High! Oh yeah, Midoriya... Don't you want to go to U.A. too? [all laughing] Midoriya? You're kidding, right? There's no way of getting into the Hero Course without a Quirk. Well, actually they got rid of that rule. I could be the first one... [angry yell] BAKUGO: Listen up, Deku... You're even worse than the rest of these damn rejects, you Quirk-less wannabe! You really think they let someone like you in when they could have me? [gasps] No way! You've got it all wrong. Really! I'm not trying to compete against you. You gotta believe me! It's just that... I've wanted to be a hero since I was little. I may not have an quirk... But I can still try my hardest, can I? You'd never be able to hang with the best of the best. You'd die in the exams! Defenseless Izuku! The schools already crappy, you really wanna embarrass it more by failing so hard? 12:02 PM, the same city [woman screaming] 12:02 PM, the same city [woman screaming] Hey, get back here! Someone stop that monster! Yell at you want, sucker. This cash is mine! [grunts] MAN 1: Dude, where are all the heroes? MAN 2: Weird, normally someone would swoop in right away... MAN 3: Maybe they're all still busy from that scene this morning Remember when we didn't have to worry about randos with Quirks all the time? MAN 2: Seriously, there's no stopping them. Yes, there is... [gasps] You know why? [gasps] I am here! Oh yeah, we should go to karaoke tonight. Yeah, let's go. Man, that fight from this morning is all over the news. Better write some notes down before I forget anything. I don't know what you think you're doing Deku, but we're not done. What ya got, his diary? Hero Analysis for the Future STUDENT: Huh? Hero Analysis for the Future Don't tell me you're taking notes on how to be a hero. Hero Analysis for the Future Don't tell me you're taking notes on how to be a hero. It's so pathetic! [laughs] He's delusional! Yeah, real funny, guys. Just give it back. [yells] That's so mean! [screams] Most first-string heroes show potential early on, people look at them and just know they're destined for greatness. When I'm the only student from this garbage junior high to get into U.A., people will start talking about me like that. They'll realise I'm legit, the next big thing. That's not ego talking, I just know I'm good. Ego... Here's a little word of advice, nerd: Don't even think of applying, or else. [whimpering] STUDENT: That's just sad. I thought you'd at least had some fight in you. He finally gets it, he'll never be a hero. Better to find out now instead of later, I guess. You know, if you really want to be a hero that badly, There actually might be another way... Just pray that you'll be born with a Quirk in your next life, and take a swan-dive off the roof of the building. [whimpering] Something wrong? [whimpering] DEKU [V/O]: That idiot! You can't go around telling people to kill themselves. What if I really jumped, what would he do then? My dreams have turned into fish food. [weakly] That's enough, give it back. Damn it. Stupid jerk. YOUNG DEKU: Mom, hurry! C'mon, mom! It's computer time! Already? [groans] Faster, let's go! Geez, I think you've added 10,000 views to this one yourself, Izuku. I don't know why you like it, I think it's scary. [giggles] DEKU [V/O]: The video I loved was an old one. Disaster footage from a long time ago. [crowd screaming] But more importantly, it was the debut of the greatest hero the world has ever known. MAN: Who is he? The guy's already saved a hundred people at least and it hasn't even been ten minutes. This is... this is crazy! I can't believe it! [grunting] [boastful laughing] MAN: Look! He's got more! [laughing contunes] [gasp] # Triumphant music # Fear not, citizens! Help has arrived!  [blubbering] Because I am here! [excited noises] # # He's the coolest in the universe! And once I get my Quirk, I'm gonna be a hero just like him. [boastful laughing] Sorry kid, it's not gonna happen. Oh dear. So you really think there's something wrong, then? Most of the other kindergartners in his class have begun to show signs already. My records say you're a fourth-generation Quirk user. What powers do you and the boy's father have? Nothing too special. I can float small objects towards me and my husband breathes fire. They're useful enough, I suppose. Izuku should have already manifested one of these Quirks or a combination of both, but after viewing his x-rays, I don't think he's going to. You see, when superpowers first began appearing there were many research studies conducted and doctors discovered a link between the bones in a person's foot and their likelihood of developing a Quirk. People with powers have only one joint in their pinky toes. Their bodies have evolved into a more streamlined version of the human form. You can see here that Izuku has two joints in his pinky. Like roughly 20% of the population these days. Based on the research that's available it's safe to say your son isn't going to develop a Quirk. # # [rain] MAN IN VIDEO: Who is he? This guy's already saved a hundred people at least and it hasn't been ten minutes! This is... this is crazy! I can't believe it! ALL MIGHT: [boastful laughing] MAN: Look! He's got more! Fear not, citizens! Help has arrived!  Because I am here! YOUNG DEKU: See that, mom? There's always a smile on his face no matter how bad things get. # # Even when things seemed impossible he never gives up. [sobbing] Do you think... I can be a hero too? # # I'm sorry, Izuku. I wish things were different. [crying] DEKU [V/O]: Mom... That's not what I needed you to say. Couldn't you see? My world was crumbling... And there was only one thing I wanted to hear... I made a decision that day. No matter what anyone else thinks, I have to believe in myself. And I'll keep smiling, just like him! [grunts] [boastful laughing] [swirling noise] [gasp] A villain? [whimpering] VILLAIN: You'll make a perfect skin suit for me to hide in, kid! DEKU: [scream] [whimpering] VILLAIN: Don't worry, I'm just taking over your body. It'll be easier for both of us if you if you don't fight back. It will only hurt for a minute. You'll feel better soon. DEKU [V/O]: I can't... breathe... VILLAIN: Grab all you want, my body's made of fluid. Thanks for the help. You're a real hero to me, kid. I didn't know he was in the city. I gotta get outta here fast, before he tracks me down. DEKU [V/O]: My body... getting... weak... I think I'm dying... No way... this can't be the end... Somebody... Help! VILLAIN: [gasp] ALL MIGHT: Have no fear, you're safe. # Triumphant music # Now that I'm here, that is. Texas... SMAAAAASH!! VILLAIN: I can't... hold... together... # # DEKU: Is that... All... Might? ALL MIGHT: Hey... Wake up. Hey! Thought we lost you there! [weak yell] [scream] Well, looks like you're moving around all right. Sorry about that back there. I didn't mean to get you caught up in my justice-ing. Usually I pay more attention to keeping bystanders safe. But it turns out this city's sewer system is pretty difficult to navigate! [boastful laughing] Anyway, you were a big help. Thank you! I've captured the evil-doer! DEKU [V/O]: The most amazing hero in the entire world... All Might... the real thing... in the flesh... standing right in front of me! He looks so much cooler in person! Holy crap, I gotta get an autograph. I've got a pen around here somewhere... Please sign my notebook. [screams] He already did! [whimpering] Thank you so much! This will be an heirloom, a family treasure passed down for generations to come! Uh-huh! Well, I've gotta get this guy to the police so they can take care of him. Stay out of trouble, see you around! Wait... you're leaving? - Already? - Pro heroes are constantly fighting time as well as enemies! DEKU [V/O]: He can't go yet. There's still so many questions I have to ask him... Now stand back, I'm taking off! [yells] Thanks for your continued support! Huh? [screaming] Hey, hey, hey! What do you think you're doing?! Let go! I love my fans but this is too much! No way, we're flying! If I let go now, I'll die! Oh, that's a good point. I just have a lot... of things I want to ask you, personally. You're my all-time favourite hero, All Might please! Okay, okay! I get it. Just keep your eyes and mouth shut. # # [sighs] [coughing] Shit! [explosive rumble] [whimpering] My whole life just flashed before my eyes. Not a very smart move. Bang on the door for a while, someone will let you in. Now, I have to go. See you on the flip side. Wait, not yet. - One second! - No! I don't have any time. I have to know! DOCTOR [V/O]: Sorry kid, it's not gonna happen... DEKU'S MOM [V/O]: I'm sorry, Izuku... I wish things were different... BAKUGO [V/O]: Defenseless Izuku! The school's already crappy, you really wanna embarrass it more by failing so hard? DEKU: Sometimes I do feel like I'm a failure... like there's no hope for me. But even so... I'm not gonna give up, ever! # # Is it possible to become a hero, even if I don't have a Quirk? I'm a normal kid without any powers. Could I ever hope to be someone like you? # Music swells # DEKU [V/O]: Meeting All Might was a dream come true. A real miracle. Standing in front of me was the hero I idolised most of my life. I didn't realise it at the time, but that chance encounter would change the course of my future. # # PREVIEW ALL MIGHT [V/O]: Never fear, adoring public! PREVIEW ALL MIGHT [V/O]: Never fear, adoring public! I am here! For the next episode preview! That goo villain has taken a boy hostage and is running amok in the town? This isn't good! But... I can't use my powers much longer or... [groans] You're pathetic, fraud All Might! Next time: What it takes to be a hero. We pros risk our lives for it's our duty to put our Quirks to the test NEXT TIME: What It Takes to Be a Hero to put our Quirks to the test and go beyond our limits!
