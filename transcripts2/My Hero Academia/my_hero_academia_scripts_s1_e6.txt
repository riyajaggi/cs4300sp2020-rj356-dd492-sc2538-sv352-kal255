   [IZUKU] Even if I have a lot to learn... I'll focus on what I can do right now. Smash! [STUDENTS gasp] [IZUKU] It hurts, but not as bad as before. [AIZAWA] A throw like that requires a lot of force. Did he focus all that power into one finger? [IZUKU] Mr. Aizawa. You see? I'm still standing. This kid. [KAMINARI] He threw it over 700 meters! Nice, he's finally showing us his true power! But his finger appears to be broken now. Just like in the exam. This Quirk is very odd. It wasn't a very pretty throw. [gasping] [KATSUKI] What the hell was that? If he had a Quirk, he would've gotten it when we were kids! This is impossible! He's up to something. [IZUKU] Someone I look up to... ...told me I have what it takes to be a hero. That's why I'm going to UA! [KATSUKI growls] I'm getting to the bottom of this. Hey! [gasps] [KATSUKI] Deku, you bastard! Tell me how you did that, or you're dead! [screams] [grunts] [gasps] What? Why the hell is your damn scarf so strong? [AIZAWA] Because it's a capture weapon made out of carbon fiber and a special metal alloy. Stand down. [gulps] [AIZAWA] It'd be wise to avoid making me use my Quirk so much. It gives me serious dry eye. [STUDENTS] Too bad. That power is amazing! [PRESENT MIC] Class 1‐A's homeroom teacher: Shota Aizawa. He can erase the Quirk of anyone he looks at, but the effect ends when he blinks. You're wasting my time now. Whoever's next can step up. [OCHACO] Ouch, is your finger okay? [IZUKU] Sure. Fine! [growls] [KATSUKI] Until the exam, he was nothing. A little bug I could crush if I wanted to. Wow, you're so lucky! Your Quirk is amazing, Kacchan. When I get mine, I hope it's just as cool! [KATSUKI] Whatever, Deku, no matter what power you end up with, you'll never be able to beat me. [KATSUKI] Just an annoying bug that I can smash into the ground. [IZUKU] After that, I had to fight through the pain as we finished up the rest of our physical fitness tests. [pants] [groans] [AIZAWA] All right, time to give you your results. I've ranked you all from best to worst. You should probably have a good idea of your standing already. I'll just pull up the whole list. It's not worth going over each individual's score. [IZUKU] The person ranked last is gonna be expelled. And the only test I was any good at was the softball throw! Can I squeak by on that score alone? I bombed the rest of the challenges! [IZUKU whimpers] [IZUKU] I'm in last place. I failed. And I was lying, no one's going home. That was just a rational deception to make sure you gave it your all in the tests. [GROUP yelps] I'm surprised the rest of you didn't figure that out. I'm sorry. I guess I probably should have said something. [JIRO, MINETA, KAMINARI] Yeah, you should have. That was pretty nerve‐wracking, huh? Nah, I'm always down for a challenge. Huh. [AIZAWA] That's it. We're done for the day. Pick up a syllabus in the classroom. Read it over before tomorrow morning. [sighs] [AIZAWA] Midoriya‐‐ Take this and go have the old lady fix you up. Things are gonna be tougher tomorrow when your actual training begins. Make sure you're prepared. [IZUKU] I managed to make it through the first day. But there was so much, I completely failed at. I'm starting out at the bottom. [IZUKU] I've still got a whole lot to learn... ...if I'm gonna achieve my dream! Aizawa, that was a rotten move. [AIZAWA] All Might. So you were watching. No talk shows today? "A rational deception." That's cute, but you're not exactly known for being lighthearted. I read your file. Last year you expelled an entire class of freshmen students. You have no problem kicking students out. Anyone you deem unworthy. You were planning to send last place home. So that can only mean... ...you see the same kind of potential in Young Midoriya that I do. What is this about? It almost sounds like you've been in his corner the whole time. [ALL MIGHT] Uh‐‐ [AIZAWA] Isn't it a little early for you to be playing favorites? He doesn't have zero potential, I admit. If that were the case. I would have sent him straight home after class without hesitation. It's cruel to let a kid keep dreaming of something that will never come true. [ALL MIGHT] In your own strange way, you're a kind man, Aizawa. I know that. But clearly, we are gonna have us a problem. [groans] I'm so tired. [gasps] Hey there, Iida! How's the broken finger doing? O‐Oh. It's doin' fine, thanks to Recovery Girl. [IZUKU screaming] Whoa, thanks, that feels so much better! But, uh, I suddenly feel really tired. I need a nap. My Quirk stimulates your ability to heal, but healing takes energy. It's not my fault, that's just how the body works. Get too many big injuries, your stamina will be shot and you'll die instead of healing, so be careful. [IZUKU] You mean this could kill me?! [IZUKU] I can't keep relying on help from others. I have to hurry up and learn to control my power. I was a bit concerned by Mr. Aizawa's approach to class. But I trust the school's judgment. UA is the top program. Even so, lying is downright immoral. [IZUKU] I thought he was scary, but that's not it. He's just really serious about school. [OCHACO] Hey! Wait up, you two! Are you going to the station? I'll join you guys! [IZUKU] It's her again! Oh, you're the infinity girl. I'm Ochaco Uraraka. Let's see. You are Tenya Iida. And your name is... Deku, right? Midoriya? [IZUKU] "Deku"? Uh, yeah, isn't that what Bakugo called you? During the fitness test, he said... Deku, you bastard! [OCHACO] Right? Uh, well. My name's actually Izuku. Deku's what Kacchan calls me to make fun of me. That's unsportsmanlike. [OCHACO] Oh, I didn't realize that! I'm sorry. But, you know what? I like "Deku." It could make a great hero name! Plus, I think it sounds kinda cute. Deku it is! [TENYA] Just like that? Weren't you saying that it was an insult? [IZUKU] Paradigm shift! My whole world is upside down! Wait, what? [IZUKU] I survived my first day at UA. Even if I kinda failed. But, you know what, All Might? At least I'm making some new friends. That's gotta be a good thing, right? [ALL MIGHT] You don't have time to relax, Midoriya. Not yet. The real test begins tomorrow. [IZUKU] UA's Hero Course curriculum. There are normal core classes, like English. They meet in the mornings. Now. Which of these four sentences contains a mistake? [ASHIDO, KAMINARI, JIRO] So boring. [KATSUKI] This really sucks. Hey, everybody, look alive! Grammar rules! [IZUKU] The relative pronoun's wrong in the last one! [PRESENT MIC] Yaoyorozu, lay it on us! [IZUKU] We eat lunch in the main cafeteria, where we can buy pretty tasty stuff on the cheap. [LUNCH RUSH] White rice is the perfect comfort food, isn't it? ‐‐[IZUKU whimpers] ‐‐[TENYA gasps] This is super good. [IZUKU] And then, in the afternoon, it's finally time. Hero Basic Training. I am here. [gasps] Coming through the door like a hero! [STUDENTS gasp] I can't believe it's really All Might! So he is a teacher! This year is gonna be totally awesome! Hey, look. Is he wearing his Silver Age costume? I'm getting goose‐bumps. It's so retro! Welcome to the most important class at UA High. Think of it as "Hero‐ing 101." Here, you will learn the basics of being a pro. And what it means to fight in the name of good! Let's get into it. Today's lesson will pull no punches! Fight training. Real combat? But one of the keys of being a hero is... ...looking good! These were designed for you based on your Quirk registration forms and the requests you sent in before school started. [STUDENTS gasp, cheer] Costumes! [ALL MIGHT] Get yourselves suited up, and then meet me at Training Ground Beta! [STUDENTS] Yes, sir! They say that clothes make the pros, young ladies and gentlemen, and behold, you are the proof! [ALL MIGHT] Take this to heart. From now on you are all... [ALL MIGHT] ... heroes in training! [ALL MIGHT] This is getting me all revved up. You look so cool! Now. Shall we get started, you buncha newbies? [IZUKU] The clothing allowance. Before we enrolled at UA High, we submitted our Quirk registration forms; which included physical measurements and any desired costume designs to an exclusive clothing company designated by the school. With all that info, they created state‐of‐the‐art costumes for us. [IZUKU] I need to go to city hall today and get my registration form for the clothing allowance. [gasps] But I'm already registered as having no Quirk! Oh, no, what should I do? Quirk registration? Yeah, you can update that, not a problem. It's that easy? [ALL MIGHT laughs] Y'know how everyone's examined and registered when they enter elementary school? Well, there are plenty of cases where people discover that their Quirks aren't exactly what they thought they were at first. You're allowed to revise your forms once or twice when you understand your powers better. Normally, they won't let you change it too much, but if you had "none" before, I'm sure they'll want you to update things. Look, just‐‐ [IZUKU'S MOM] Hi, I'm home! [gasps] Crap! I hung up on All Might! [IZUKU] I'll have to apologize later. [IZUKU] Heya, Mom! Oh, good. You're here. Congratulations! I'm so proud you got into UA! Is that a costume? I guess I might have jumped the gun a little bit. I brought you food earlier but you'd dozed off, and I maybe happened to peek at your notebook. [IZUKU] Seriously? To be honest with you, I've been feeling really terrible lately. About something I said to you. I think you might have felt that I gave up on you a while back. But now look at you. You persevered, and kept chasing your dream like a real champion. I'm sorry, Izuku. And I promise, I'll support you with everything I've got from now on! [IZUKU] It's a gift from my mom, so of course it's what I'm gonna wear! It's not state‐of‐the‐art or flashy, but it means something to me. [IZUKU] This is it. My hero costume! Ah! Hey, Deku! [IZUKU] Uraraka! [OCHACO] Love your costume! Not too flashy, ya know? [IZUKU muffled whimpering] [OCHACO] I should've been more specific about what I wanted. This bodysuit is skintight. Not really my style. I love this school. [IZUKU] Huh? [ALL MIGHT growls] [ALL MIGHT] You're so obvious. Now that you're ready, it's time for combat training. [TENYA] Sir! [IZUKU] Oh. So That's Iida under there. He looks so cool! [TENYA] This is the fake city from our entrance exam. Does that mean that we'll be conducting urban battles again? Not quite. I'm going to move you two steps ahead. Most of the villain fights you see on the news take place outside. However, statistically speaking, run‐ins with the most dastardly evildoers take place indoors. [IZUKU grunts] [ALL MIGHT] Think about it. Backroom deals, home invasions, secret underground lairs. Truly intelligent criminals stay hidden in the shadows. For this training exercise, you'll be split into teams of good guys and bad guys and fight two‐on‐two indoor battles. Isn't this a little advanced? The best training is what you get on the battlefield! But remember, you can't just punch a robot this time. You're dealing with actual people now. Sir, will you be the one deciding who wins? How much can we hurt the other team? Do we need to worry about the losers getting expelled like earlier? [TENYA] Will you be splitting us up based on chance or comparative skill? Isn't this cape trÃ¨s chic? [ALL MIGHT growls] I wasn't finished talking! [ALL MIGHT] Listen up. [IZUKU] A script? [ALL MIGHT] The situation is this. The villains have hidden a nuclear missile somewhere in their hideout. The heroes must try to foil their plans. To do that, the good guys either have to catch the evildoers or recover the weapon. Likewise, the bad guys succeed if they protect their payload or capture the heroes. [IZUKU] Sounds like a classic action movie setup. Time's limited, and we'll choose teams by drawing lots! [TENYA] Isn't there a better way? Think about it! Pros often have to team up with heroes from other agencies on the spot, so maybe that's the reason we're seeing that here. [TENYA] Yes, I see. Life is a random series of events. Excuse my rudeness. No sweat. Let's draw! Wow, what are the chances? We're a team! [IZUKU] Oh my gosh! I have to make a good impression on her. I declare that the first teams to fight will be... ...these guys! Team A will be the heroes, Team D will be the villains. Everyone else can head to the monitoring room to watch! [STUDENTS] Yes, sir! [gasps] [gasps] [growls] [ALL MIGHT] Bad guys, you can go on in and get set up. In five minutes, the good guys will be let loose and the battle will start! [TENYA, OCHAC, IZUKU] Yes, sir! [ALL MIGHT] Young Iida. Young Bakugo. The key to being successful in this challenge is to embody villainy. Think from the perspective of an evildoer. [TENYA] Got it! [ALL MIGHT] If things go too far, I'll step in. [TENYA] Understood! [growls] [TENYA] Even though this is training, it pains me to be aligned with criminal behavior. [TENYA] So this is the weapon we must protect. Fake, of course. [KATSUKI] Hey! [TENYA] Hm? [KATSUKI] Do you really think Deku has a Quirk? You saw how he threw that ball. Though I think his power hurts his body. [KATSUKI] Tch. [TENYA] Why is it that you seem to be especially angry when it comes to Midoriya? [KATSUKI] Was he seriously just tricking me all these years? I'm gonna roast that damn nerd today! [OCHACO] Ya think they expect us to memorize this building's floor plan? It's so big! You know. All Might's just as cool in person as he is on television! I'm glad he's not threatening us with some kind of punishment like Mr. Aizawa. We can relax‐‐ Ah! You're sweating through your costume! Uh. Well. It's just because we're up against Kacchan. Plus there's Iida, too. We should be on our guard, who knows what they'll pull. Oh, right. Bakugo. He's the one who's always making fun of you. [IZUKU sighs] And he's amazing. I'll end up more popular than All Might himself, and be the richest hero of all time! [IZUKU] He can be a real pain, sure. But his strength and confidence... ...and his ambition... Not to mention his Quirk. They're all so much greater than mine. Uh... [IZUKU] But that just means I have to do better. I refuse to lose today. So it's a fated battle between rivals? [IZUKU] Oh, not that I'm trying to get you wrapped up in my fight or anything! Are you kidding? We're a team, right? Let's win this! [ALL MIGHT] All right! Let's begin the indoor combat training! Team A and Team D, your time starts now! Pay attention, kids. Think about what you would do. [ALL MIGHT] Young Midoriya! In this class, you're just another student. I'll grade you as I would anyone else. Without playing favorites. And just like that, we're in. [IZUKU] Careful, there are a lot of blind spots. [IZUKU] I still have basically no control over One For All. I can't risk using it. If I did, I'd probably end up killing someone. We'll just have to win with Uraraka's Zero Gravity, and whatever I can do without a Quirk. I've gotta use my head. I took a lot of notes on indoor battles and fighting in tight spaces. [IZUKU] I can do this! [IZUKU gasps] [grunting] Uraraka, you okay? [OCHACO] I'm fine. Thanks! Oh! Deku! It's just my mask. [BOTH gasp] What's the matter, Deku? Afraid to stand up and fight me? I knew you'd come at me first. And figured you'd try to catch me by surprise. [MINETA] He almost got the jump on them. Sneak attack, Bakugo? What kinda man pulls cheap crap like that? It's a viable strategy. He's playing the part. Acting like a true villain would. It didn't work. Midoriya dodged him! Look, there he goes! I won't hurt you so bad they'll have to stop the fight. Just close! [yells] [gasps] Wow! Look at those moves! [KATSUKI] Impossible. How'd he know? He's not that good! [grunting] [yells] [groans] [ALL MIGHT] Huh? [IZUKU pants] [IZUKU] Kacchan. You always use a big right hook to start a fight. I know because I've watched you for years. [KATSUKI] Huh? [IZUKU] I analyzed every amazing hero, even you. I wanted to learn everything I could about them. It was all in the notebook you burned and threw away. [growls] You can call me Deku, but I'm not the same helpless, defenseless kid anymore! You hear me? I've changed. From now on, Deku is the name of a hero! [gasps] [OCHACO] But you know what? I like "Deku." It could make a great hero name! Plus, I think it sounds kinda cute. [KATSUKI] Deku. If you keep on hurting him, then I'll stop you myself! [IZUKU grunting] [KATSUKI] You're shaking in your boots, you're so scared. [growls] [KATSUKI] But you wanna fight me anyway. That's why I hate you! [TENYA] Midoriya. Even though this is just training, I'm going to give my all, 100%. That's the Iida way, and I won't tarnish my family's heroic name! [IZUKU] Iida. Are you sure you can play a convincing villain? [TENYA laughs] Of course. Didn't you know, I'm extremely evil? [IZUKU yelps] He's so in character. Next time: "Deku vs. Kacchan"! [TENYA] Hold on, I didn't know Uraraka was a baseball player! [IZUKU] Go beyond! [IZUKU, TENYA] Plus Ultra!
