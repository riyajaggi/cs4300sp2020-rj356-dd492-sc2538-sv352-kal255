[IZUKU] U‐Um, sorry, I have to go to the, uh, the nurse's office! Yeah, right away! Are you one of All Might's students? Tell us‐‐ what's the Symbol of Peace like in person? Um... What's he like? Well... Uh‐‐ He's super muscle‐y. Yeah! How is he faring as a teacher; what are you learning? His leadership and wisdom remind me on a daily basis that I attend the world's most prestigious educational institution. Of course, he's the personification of honor and integrity that one would expect, but he's also not afraid to show his students a more humorous side. It's truly a unique opportunity to be under the direct tutelage of the pro we all admire. Excuse me, kid! Are you in All Might's class? Oh, hold on. Aren't you that Sludge Villain kid? Walk away. Please, sir. Can you get All Might for us? Also, you look like a mess, what's your deal? All Might's not on campus today. Now get outta here, you've disturbed my students enough already. [REPORTER A gasps] But my viewers wanna know how he's adjusting to life as a teacher! [REPORTER B] I feel like I've seen that guy somewhere before. But where? [REPORTER A] I don't know, but he's a bit scruffy for a hero... [AIZAWA] How does All Might ever get anything done with this media circus stepping on his cape? All right. If you won't bring All Might out, I'll‐‐ No, hold on! [alarm blares] [REPORTER A shrieks] Hey! What's happening? Don't you know about the school's defenses? This gate is the UA Barrier. Defenses? It practically killed me! [REPORTER B] Yeah, well, it's designed to stop anyone who doesn't have a student ID or special pass from entering the campus. Guess it works. [REPORTER A grunts] [REPORTER B] Apparently, there are security sensors like this all over the place. [REPORTER A] Keeping the public out. This school thinks it's untouchable! The least they could do is grant me one interview. [REPORTER B] I know, right? We've been here for two days and I don't have a single comment on the record yet. [IZUKU] The news that All Might had been hired as a faculty member at UA took the entire nation by surprise. Naturally, the media swarmed the school in search of a story. Everyone wanted to get their hands on All Might. Yeah. Everyone. [AIZAWA] Decent work on yesterday's combat training, you guys. I saw the video feeds and went over each of your team's results. Bakugo. You're talented. So don't sulk like a child about your loss, okay? Yeah, whatever. [AIZAWA] And Midoriya. I see the only way you won the match was by messing up your arm again. Work harder. And don't give me the excuse that you don't have control over your Quirk. That line's already getting old. You can't keep breaking your body while training here. But your Quirk will be really useful if you can get a handle on it. [gasps] [AIZAWA] So show a little urgency, huh? Right. Let's get down to business. Our first task will decide your future. [STUDENTS] Is it another Quirk test? You all need to pick a class representative. [STUDENTS] Oh, good. Just normal school stuff! Pick me, guys! I wanna be class rep! I'll take it! Yeah, you're gonna need me. Someone with style would be best. I'm, like, totally the right pick! [IZUKU] In a normal classroom, a representative's duties would just be a bunch of extra work. But here in the hero course, there's more to it. It's a way to get noticed by agencies and prove you can lead a team like a real pro. Silence, everyone, please! [TENYA] The class representative's duty is to lead others. That's not something just anyone can do. You must first have the trust of every student in the classroom. Therefore, the most logical way to fill this position is democratically. We will hold an election to choose our leader! [STUDENTS] It's pretty obvious you want us to vote for you. Is this really the best idea? We've only known each other a few days, how do we know who we can trust? Besides, everyone'll just vote for themselves. Most people will. But that means whoever does receive multiple votes must truly be the most suitable person for the job. It's the best way, right, sir? Do what you want, just decide before my nap's over. [TENYA] Thank you for your trust! How did I get three votes? Okay, you idiots, who voted for him? What, did you honestly think anyone was gonna vote for you? [KATSUKI] What did you just say?! [OCHACO] Maybe I'll just keep my vote to myself. Zero votes... I feared this might happen, but I can't argue with the system I chose! So you voted for someone else, huh? But you knew it was best to vote for yourself, right? What were you tryin' to prove here, Iida? [AIZAWA] All right, the class rep is Midoriya, and our deputy is Yaoyorozu. Really? Uh. It's not a mistake? [sighs] How'd this happen? This might not be so bad. Yeah, I can get behind Midoriya I guess. [KAMINARI] Yaoyorozu was totally on top of it when it came to our training results! [OCHACO sighs] It's always so crowded in here! [TENYA] That's because students in the support, management, and hero courses all share the same cafeteria. This rice is delicious! [sighs] Guys, I'm kinda worried about the class rep thing, I don't think I'm qualified. Sure you are. You'll be great. [IZUKU] Hm? Your courage and quick thinking under stress will help make you a worthy leader. Not to mention the strength you've demonstrated. Those are the reasons I voted for you, at least. [IZUKU] You were one of the three? Didn't you wanna be rep really badly, I mean you do look the part. 'Cause of the glasses! [IZUKU] That's not exactly how we should be choosing our rep. Wanting a job and being suited to it are quite different things. Observing the Iida family's hero agency has taught me that much. [OCHACO, IZUKU] "Agency"? Hold on, what does your family do? [TENYA] Uh‐‐ Oh, it's nothing. Y'know, I've been wondering something about you. Admit it, Iida. You're filthy rich! Uh‐‐ I was afraid people would treat me differently if they knew about my family. [OCHACO, IZUKU] Oooh... [sighs] You see, the Iidas have been pro heroes for generations. It runs in our blood. [IZUKU, OCHACO] What? That's awesome! Are the two of you familiar with the Turbo Hero, Ingenium? I know all about him! He's a super‐popular pro with 65 sidekicks working alongside him at his Tokyo agency! Don't tell me... He's my elder brother! [OCHACO] Your family's famous! [IZUKU] I can't believe it! [TENYA] Ingenium is an unmatched commander who honors the hero code. As the second oldest Iida son, I strive to be just like him. However, I think it might be a bit soon for me to be in a real leadership role. You, for example. You figured out what the judges were looking for in the practical exam. A rep needs that sort of insight. [IZUKU, OCHACO gasp] That's the first time I've seen you smile, Tenya! You should do it more. [TENYA] What're you talking about? I smile all the time! [IZUKU] Iida wants to be like Ingenium in the same way I wanna be like All Might. But he shouldn't be so hard on himself. I was clueless in that test. Hey, yeah, so about that practical exam‐‐ [bell rings] ‐‐[TENYA, OCHACO gasp] ‐‐What is that? [ANNOUNCER A] Warning. Level Three security breach. No way! [ANNOUNCER A] All students please evacuate the building in an orderly fashion. What's a "Level Three security breach?" It means that someone's managed to get past the school's barriers! This hasn't happened in my three years here. We should get going! [STUDENTS yelling] Stop shovin' so hard! [STUDENT B] Wait, I'm getting trampled! [STUDENT A] I said, stop pushin' me! Ow. This is a total mob! Everyone was quick to react. As I'd expect from UA students. Sure. But they're also causing a huge panic. Crap! I can't stop! ‐‐[TENYA] Godspeed, Midoriya! ‐‐[OCHACO] Oh no, Deku! Who in the world could've trespassed onto campus grounds? It's... the press that was outside! All you have to do is give us All Might! He's here somewhere! We said it's his day off. [REPORTER B] Just give us one good comment on record and then we'll leave. I know how you people work, give you an inch and you'll want a mile. They are trespassing. That means they're kinda like villains. Why don't we just beat 'em up? Don't you even think about it. Unless you want your name dragged through the mud. Let's wait for the cops. [PRESENT MIC groans] I was afraid it was some kind of attack on the school, but there's no need to worry, everyone! [STUDENT C] Ow! [STUDENT D] Sorry, I think I... [STUDENT E] Back off! [TENYA] Where're the teachers? Why aren't they taking control? [KIRISHIMA] Everyone! Stop freakin' out! [TENYA] Kirishima! Kaminari! [KAMINARI] The current's too strong! [TENYA] Am I the only one here who realizes everything's fine? There's no reason for us to be panicking! [OCHACO yelps] [TENYA] Uraraka! Tenya, help me! [grunts] [TENYA] What would Midoriya do? Or my brother? How would they handle this? [TENYA gasps] [yelps] [TENYA] I have an idea! Huh? [TENYA] Touch my hand. Make me float above everyone else! Oh. [TENYA] I need a place where I'll get everyone's attention! Engine Boost, go! [IZUKU grunts] [TENYA yelping] What're you doing? [TENYA yelping] [TENYA] This is it. Be concise, clear, and confident. Make an impact! Listen up, everything is okay! [STUDENTS gasp] [gasps] [TENYA] It's just the media outside. There's absolutely nothing to worry about. Everything's fine! We're UA students. We need to remain calm and prove that we're the best of the best. [STUDENTS sigh, mumble] [IZUKU gasps] [STUDENT F] Look, the police are here! [STUDENT G] Thank goodness. [PRESENT MIC] That's a wrap. Get these vultures out of our station! [police sirens blaring] [YAOYOROZU] It's time, class rep. Let's begin. Um. Okay, so we need to figure out who the other class officers will be. But first, there's something that I wanna say. I've thought a lot about this. And I think that Tenya Iida should be our class rep! [TENYA gasps] He was able to capture everyone's attention and get us in line. So I believe that he should be the one leading our class from now on! [gasps] [KIRISHIMA] Yeah, you know what? If Midoriya vouches for him, I'm good. Plus he was a big help. He totally manned up and took charge, right? [KAMINARI] Yup! Oh! Did you notice he looked like the dude on the emergency exit signs when he was on the wall earlier? This is a waste of time. [yelps] I don't care who the rep is, just hurry up. If Midoriya is nominating me for this job... ...then I humbly accept. I pledge to carry out the duties of class rep to the best of my abilities! Sounds good, Emergency Exit! [KAMINARI] Emergency Exit Iida! Don't let us down, man! Hello, I got two more votes than him. [PRINCIPAL] How were ordinary members of the press able to bypass our security systems? Someone else must have been behind this. Some villain actually managed to infiltrate our school. But was this purely a show of power or a declaration of war? [panting] [HEADGEAR] Don't move. One step closer, and I'll kill this whole family. You don't want the blood of these damned yuppies on your hands, now, do ya, heroes? [ALL MIGHT] Never fear, dear citizens! Missouri Smash! [HEADGEAR groans] [ALL MIGHT] I'm here to keep you safe even on my morning commute! [WOMAN A shrieks] A hit‐and‐run! I shouldn't be late for school, but I can't ignore someone in need! [ALL MIGHT] I've clearly gotten slower. My powers have been weakening even faster since I gave One For All to Young Midoriya. I'm pushing my hero form too far past the limits. Fighting that Sludge Villain even though I was exhausted shortened the time I can spend as the Symbol of Peace. [ALL MIGHT sighs] [ALL MIGHT] Wait. You told Bakugo, what? [IZUKU] I'm so sorry. [ALL MIGHT grunts] [IZUKU] I didn't even tell my mom about any of this, but for some reason, I felt like I had to explain it to him. Like it was only fair that he knew. [ALL MIGHT] Midoriya isn't the type of person who wants to show off. That's not the reason he shared our secret, so I didn't lecture him too much. Don't look so sad. He didn't take you seriously, so I don't think he'll say anything. This time I'll let things slide. Just make sure this doesn't happen again. You need to think carefully about the responsibility that comes with this power. If word got out that One For All could be passed on, villains across the globe would come for you, trying to take it. You must keep this secret to ensure your own wellbeing, true. But also for the safety of the world. [gasps] [ALL MIGHT] Understand? [ALL MIGHT] Even if he is a more suitable vessel now, he's still a 15‐year‐old boy. I have to make sure I guide him well. [TOWNSPERSON A] There's a hostage situation across town! [ALL MIGHT growls] [AIZAWA] Today's training will be a little different. You'll have three instructors. Me, All Might, and another faculty member will be keeping tabs on you. [STUDENTS gasp] [IZUKU] Three pros? Is that because of the break in? Sir! What kinda training is this? [AIZAWA] Rescue. You'll be dealing with natural disasters, shipwrecks, stuff like that. ‐‐[STUDENTS chatter] ‐‐Disasters, huh? Sounds like we're in for a big workout. [ASHIDO] Totally! Real hero stuff. This is what separates the men from the boys. I'm shakin' with excitement. Finally, I'll get to show off how good I am in water. Ribbit. [AIZAWA] Guys, I'm not finished yet. [STUDENTS gasp] What you wear in this exercise is up to you. I know you're excited about costumes... [AIZAWA] ... but keep in mind that you haven't gotten used to them yet, and they might limit your abilities. This special training's at an off‐campus facility, so we'll be taking a bus to get there. That's all. Start getting ready. [IZUKU] Rescue training. I've been waiting for this. It'll bring me one step closer to being the kind of hero he is. I'll do my best. [OCHACO] Deku? Why are you wearing your PE clothes? Where's your costume at? You saw it after the combat training. It was kinda trashed. I'm still waiting on the support company to fix it up. [whistle blows] Gather around, Class 1‐A! Using your student numbers, form two neat lines so we can load the bus efficiently. [IZUKU] Iida's kicking it into high gear as our class rep, huh? [TENYA] The bus's open layout ruined my boarding strategy. Iida, you really need to chill. If we're pointing out the obvious, then there's something I wanna say... about you, actually. About me? What is it, Asui? I told you to call me "Tsu." Oh. Yeah, right. That power of yours. Isn't it a lot like All Might's? [IZUKU yelps] What? Really? You think so, huh? I never really thought about that. I guess it's kinda similar... Wait, hold on, Tsu. You're forgetting All Might doesn't hurt himself. That makes a huge difference. [sighs] Still, I bet it's cool to have a simple augmenting‐type a' Quirk. You can do lots of flashy stuff with it. My Hardening's super strong and can destroy bad guys in a fight, but it doesn't look all that impressive. Oh, no way, I think it's really awesome looking. You're definitely pro material with a Quirk like that. You really think so? Seems like it'd be easier to be a popular hero if I had somethin' flashier. My Navel Laser's got the perfect combination of panache and strength. But it's way lame if it gives you a stomachache, sweetie. Well, if any of our classmates have pro Quirks, it's Todoroki and Bakugo. Sure, but Bakugo's always angry, so he'll never be that popular. [KATSUKI] Uh‐‐ What'd you say? I'll kick your ass! Ya see? Y'know, we basically just met you. So it's kinda telling that we all know your personality is flaming crap mixed with garbage. You're gonna regret the day you applied to this school, you loser...! [IZUKU] I can't believe what I'm hearing. Kacchan's the one in class who's getting teased. UA is so confusing! [KAMINARI] Wait, what did you say? [YAOYOROZU] This is such a disgusting conversation. Yeah, but it's kind of fun listening to them fight. [KATSUKI] Like hell I will. Hey, hey, we're here. Stop messing around. ‐‐[STUDENTS] Yes, sir. ‐‐[KATSUKI] Whatever. [THIRTEEN] Hello, everyone, I've been waiting for you! [STUDENTS gasp] [IZUKU] It's the Space Hero, Thirteen! The chivalrous pro who's rescued a ton of people from disasters across the world! Woo‐hoo! Thirteen is one of my favorite heroes! [THIRTEEN] I can't wait to show you what's inside! [STUDENTS] This is gonna be awesome! [STUDENTS gasp] [KIRISHIMA] Holy crap! It looks like some kind of amusement park! [THIRTEEN] A shipwreck. A landslide. A fire. A windstorm. Et cetera‐‐ I created this training facility to prepare you to deal with different types of disasters. I call it the Unforeseen Simulation Joint. But, you can call it, USJ! [STUDENTS] Just like Universal Studios Japan. Hey, shouldn't All Might be here already? Lemme guess, he booked an interview instead. [THIRTEEN] Actually, it's something else. [AIZAWA] Hm? [THIRTEEN] Apparently he did too much hero work on the way to school this morning and used up all his power. He's resting in the teacher's lounge. I'm sorry. I should be able to catch the tail end of the rescue exercises. I'll be there as soon as I can. That man is the height of irresponsibility. [AIZAWA] Well, we should be okay with just the two of us. The clock's ticking. We should get started. [THIRTEEN] Excellent. Before we begin, let me just say one thing. Well, maybe two things. Possibly three, four, or five. [STUDENTS] We get it! [THIRTEEN] Listen carefully. I'm sure you're aware that I have a powerful Quirk. It's called Black Hole. I can use it to suck up anything and turn it into dust. Yeah, you've used Black Hole to save people from all kinds of disasters before, haven't you? [THIRTEEN] That's true, but my Quirk could also very easily be used to kill. [OCHACO, TENYA, IZUKU gasp] [THIRTEEN] Some of you also have powers that can be dangerous. [TENYA, IZUKU, OCHACO] Oh... [THIRTEEN] In our superhuman society, all Quirks are certified and stringently regulated, so we often overlook how unsafe they can actually be. Please don't forget that if you lose focus or make the wrong move, your powers can be deadly. Even if you're trying to do something virtuous like rescue someone. Thanks to Aizawa's fitness tests, you have a solid idea of your Quirk's potential. And because of All Might's combat training, you likely experienced how dangerous your powers can be when used against other people. Carry those lessons over to this class. Today, you're going to learn how to use your Quirks to save people's lives. You won't be using your powers to attack enemies or each other, only to help. After all, that's what being a hero is all about. Ensuring the safety of others. [IZUKU] Thirteen is so cool! [THIRTEEN] That's all I have to say. Thank you so much for listening. [STUDENTS cheer] Right. Now that that's over... [STUDENTS gasp] [AIZAWA grunts] [grunts] Stay together and don't move! [STUDENTS gasp] [AIZAWA] Thirteen. Protect the students! Whoa, what is that thing? [IZUKU gasps] Wait, has the training started already? I thought we were rescuing people. [AIZAWA] Stay back! [gasps] [AIZAWA] This is real. Those are villains. [STUDENTS gasp] [IZUKU] We thought we were going to be practicing saving other people's lives that day, but when they appeared, we realized we were the ones in danger. [IZUKU] Asui. The villains are attacking us! [TSUYU] I told you, call me "Tsu." [IZUKU] Is this really the time to be correcting me? Next time: "Encounter with the Unknown." [TSUYU] Oh, so that's why Mineta's hair is like that. Now I get it. [IZUKU] Let's Go beyond! [TSUYU, IZUKU] Plus Ultra!
