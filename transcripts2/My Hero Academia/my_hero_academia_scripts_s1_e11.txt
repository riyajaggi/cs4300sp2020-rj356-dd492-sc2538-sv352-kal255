   [SHIGARAKI] Kill the Symbol of Peace. All Might. [KUROGIRI] It's a pleasure to meet you. We are the League of Villains. I know it's impolite, but we decided to invite ourselves in to this haven of justice to say hello. And besides, isn't this a fitting place for All Might, the Symbol of Peace, to take his last breath? [grunts] [TENYA] What's going on? [VILLAIN A] Idiots, that's Eraser Head! A pro! He can cancel your Quirks just by looking at you. [THIRTEEN] Class rep! Yes? [THIRTEEN] I have a job for you. Run to the school and tell the faculty what's going on here. Yes, but‐‐ It would be disgraceful for me to leave you all behind. [THIRTEEN] Use your Quirk to save others. Be a real hero! [THIRTEEN] Black Hole! [MINETA gasps] What do you mean "fight"? Are you crazy?! [gasps] [IZUKU] Now's our chance. We can beat them! [IZUKU yells] Take this! Delaware Smash! [SEA VILLAINS screaming] [yelling] Take this, you villains! You can eat my sticky balls! [HALF‐FISH VILLAIN A] Move! ‐‐[SEA VILLAIN A] Get off me! ‐‐[SEA VILLAIN B] I'm stuck! [HALF‐FISH VILLAIN A] You're gonna drown me! Not too shabby. You guys are amazing. Both of you. [TSUYU] I guess we passed the shipwreck zone. [MINETA chuckles] I had a good poop this morning, which makes my balls stickier. They're not goin' anywhere! Can't believe we managed to get all of 'em at once. It took everything I had to keep my composure. It was such a gamble, what if they'd had reserves underwater that we didn't know about? They could've... [TSUYU] You're creeping me out. Stop it. Please. [IZUKU] Uh‐‐ [TSUYU] Instead of second guessing what we did, shouldn't we think about our next move? Yeah. You're totally right. Ah‐‐ [TSUYU] Are you okay? Yeah. Fine. Don't worry about me. We should make getting help our top priority! If we follow the shore to the exit, then we can avoid the central plaza entirely. Good idea. That way we don't run into the villains Mr. Aizawa's facing off with there. [IZUKU] Yeah, but, can he handle them on his own? How long can he hold out against a big group like that? If he doesn't get some backup, then he's just going to overexert himself. He'll end up defeated by those villains 'cause he was trying to keep us safe. [gasps] Wait. Don't tell me you're suggesting...? Are you trying to get us killed or something? I'm not saying that we should jump into the middle of a battle. But... Maybe we can find a way to take a few of those guys out and lighten his load. [IZUKU] We'd had our first real fight and won, but that only gave us false hope. It made us think our powers could actually work against the enemy. We'd soon learn how wrong we were. [TODOROKI] So the plan was to scatter us, and then kill us. You were woefully unprepared. In fact, it looks to me as though you've had no training. You haven't the slightest idea how to use your Quirks. This power... He froze us the instant we warped here. [LANDSLIDE VILLAIN B] He's not a kid, he's a monster! So cold... [SHIGARAKI] Where is he? I went through the trouble of bringing so many friends who're eager to meet him. [TODOROKI] How do they plan to kill All Might? At first I thought they'd gathered a force of elite criminals who could simply overpower him. [yells] [TODOROKI] But that can't possibly be their master plan. Most these villains are low‐level thugs. Just pawns. [LANDSLIDE VILLAIN E groans] [TODOROKI] From what I can tell, there are only four or five truly dangerous people here. If that's the case, then what we need right now is more information. Listen well. If you stay frozen, your cells will slowly die as your body succumbs to frostbite and hypothermia. [LANDSLIDE VILLAINS whimper] [TODOROKI] Luckily for you, I wanna be a hero. So I'd like to avoid any unnecessary cruelty. But I can only do that if you tell me how you plan to kill All Might. That's the only way you'll survive. [screams] [MOUNTAIN VILLAIN A grunts] These dudes are terrifying! My whole life just flashed before my eyes, I think I saw the grim reaper! What's going on? Could you maybe take it down a few notches? [YAOYOROZU] Right now we need to focus on getting away from these enemies. Then pull out a weapon for me, too! You're the one with electrical powers. Just zap 'em so we can run. Were you not paying attention during combat training? Some partner you were. I can cover my body with electricity. But if I try to shoot it out, it'll go everywhere! I'd take you guys down along with them! Or did you want shock treatment today? I can't even call for help because there's still interference jamming the signal! I'm counting on you two. I'm no help in this situation. You've gotta get us outta here. Please! You're a real damsel in distress, aren't you? Uh‐‐ Ah! [JIRO] New idea. You're my human stun gun. Seriously? Come o‐‐ [MOUNTAIN VILLAIN A groans] Whoa. Hey, this is working! I'm super strong! Sit back, you two. You can count on me! [JIRO] You are exhausting. [gasps] Try electrocuting solid rock, kid! [KAMINARI groans] [MOUNTAIN VILLAINS yelp] [grunts] [yelps] [MOUNTAIN VILLAINS screaming] You're lucky that worked out so well. I'm sorry. Next time I'll ask before saving our butts. [PRESENT MIC] Kyoka Jiro! Her Quirk: Earphone Jack! She can turn her own heartbeats into explosively amplified sound waves by inserting her plugs! Plus, she can hear really quiet sounds. So hip! [JIRO] Damn it, Kaminari. You couldn't have asked for some kind of aiming gear when you put in your costume request form? I mean, come on! [grunts] It's ready! [JIRO gasps] [YAOYOROZU] It takes me a little longer... to create an object this big! [MOUNTAIN VILLAIN H] A blanket? [MOUNTAIN VILLAIN I] Is it supposed to be a shield? You're looking at a sheet of insulation 100 millimeters thick. Go, Kaminari. Heh. Badass. [KAMINARI] Now I don't have to worry about hurting my friends. You guys are fried! [MOUNTAIN VILLAINS screaming] [YAOYOROZU] Now then. I'm worried about the rest of our class. We should find them right away. You're looking a little overexposed right now! Huh? I can make some new clothes. [PRESENT MIC] Momo Yaoyorozu. Her Quirk: Creation! She can create any non‐living object she wants! But she's only able to do this if she understands the molecular structure of the item she's making. [JIRO] Yaoyorozu is so punk rock. Huh? Kaminari, don't you dare look! [YAOYOROZU] Uh... [KAMINARI laughing] [PRESENT MIC] Denki Kaminari: Electrification! When he goes over his wattage limit, his brain short circuits and he becomes a huge idiot for a while! Listen to him babbling! [MINETA whispering] Remember, Midoriya, we're just here to see how things are going, right? [TSUYU whispering] Ribbit. [IZUKU] Yeah, I know. We'll get outta here the second it seems dangerous. ‐‐[AIZAWA grunting] ‐‐[VILLAINS groaning] [VILLAINS groan] [AIZAWA grunts] [gasps] [SHIGARAKI] First it was 23 seconds. Final boss. [SHIGARAKI] Then it was 24 seconds. And then 20. Then 17. [grunts] [ALL gasp] [AIZAWA pants] [SHIGARAKI] It was hard to see when you were jumping around, but I've found your tell. It's your hair. When it drops, it means you've stopped using your Quirk. You're having to blink more often. Don't push yourself too hard, now. You might just fall apart. Wouldn't that be a shame? [gasps] [AIZAWA grunts] [AIZAWA] He destroyed my elbow. [VILLAIN D grunting] [AIZAWA, VILLAINS grunting] [AIZAWA panting] [SHIGARAKI] That annoying Quirk of yours isn't suited for drawn‐out fights against big groups, is it? Don't you think you're a little out of your element here, Eraser Head? You're much better at working stealthily. You're known for surprise attacks, not fighting head‐to‐head. [panting] [SHIGARAKI] But despite knowing that, you didn't hesitate to jump into the middle of this fight. To put your students at ease. [SNAIL‐EYES VILLAIN A grunts] ‐‐[AIZAWA grunting] ‐‐[VILLAINS groaning] [AIZAWA panting] [grunting, panting] [SHIGARAKI] And look at you, you're still standing! You really are so cool! [SHIGARAKI] Oh, by the way, hero. [gasps] [SHIGARAKI] I am not the final boss. [AIZAWA grunts] ‐‐[gasps] ‐‐[thuding] ‐‐No, Mr. Aizawa... ‐‐[thuding] [KUROGIRI] Ah, Black Hole, the Quirk that sucks up matter and turns it to dust. Such an astounding power. However, you're a rescue hero, Thirteen, skilled at saving people from disasters. Consequently, that means you have little fighting experience or battlefield awareness. [THIRTEEN yelps] [STUDENTS gasping] [THIRTEEN] He opened a warp gate! [KUROGIRI chuckles] [KUROGIRI] How unfortunate. You've turned yourself into dust. [STUDENTS gasping] [THIRTEEN] I'm sorry. He got me. Thirteen! Iida, get outta here! Go! Now! U‐Uh‐‐ [THIRTEEN] Use your Quirk to save others. Be a real hero! [grunts] Engine! [KUROGIRI] A sheep trying to escape from the wolves. I simply can't allow that. [pants] [KUROGIRI] If other heroes arrive, it'll be harder for us to put an end to All Might. [TENYA] This responsibility... [TENYA] ...was entrusted to me! Classmates! I'll keep you safe! [SHOJI] Run! [TENYA gasps] [SHOJI] I've got him! [TENYA grunts] [TENYA] I'll be back in a flash! [KUROGIRI] You impertinent child! [gasps] [KUROGIRI] You won't set foot outside those doors! [TENYA] I'm close! But what if it's locked? Will I be able to pry it open in time? [KUROGIRI] I have no time for this. [KUROGIRI] Be gone! [TENYA grunts] [IZUKU] This was it. Ya see? Good as new. [IZUKU] The evil that pros faced... We'd gotten our first look, but the worst was yet to come. [AIZAWA gasping] [SHIGARAKI] What do you think of him, Eraser Head? Hm... He's the bioengineered, anti‐Symbol of Peace. But you can call him "Nomu." [shrieks] Say goodbye! [VILLAINS groan] ‐‐[KIRISHIMA grunting] ‐‐[VILLAIN I groaning] [KIRISHIMA, KATSUKI panting] Think that's the last of these guys. Buncha weaklings. All right. Let's hurry and find the rest of our class. If we're both still in the USJ, then everyone else probably is, too. And not all of them have the offensive skills we do. We gotta make sure they're safe. Especially since we screwed things up when we got in the way earlier. If Thirteen had been able to suck up that villain, then we never would've been separated like that. We have to make it up to the others! You wanna track everyone down, have fun. But I'm gonna go destroy that warpy bastard. Huh? Our physical attacks didn't hurt that guy. C'mon. Don't be an idiot, man. [KATSUKI] Shut up! I'm gonna take him down because he's their way in and out. If I cut off their escape route, they'll be stuck here and have to pay for what they've done. We'll just have to figure it out. [CAMOUFLAGE VILLAIN A] Hope you had fun chit‐chatting. Too bad you let your guard down‐‐ [CAMOUFLAGE VILLAIN A screams] [KATSUKI] Anyway. If all these villains are small fries like these guys were, then our classmates can handle 'em. [KIRISHIMA] That reaction time was insane. Also... Since when do you act so calm and rational? Usually you're all like... [KATSUKI] Die! Die! Die! I'm always calm and rational, you red‐haired loser! Yeah! There you are. [KATSUKI grunts] Go find the others if you want to. Wait, hold up! I think what you're really saying is that you believe in our classmates. And that's thinkin' like a man, Bakugo. [FIRE VILLAIN A] Damn it! He's too fast! [FIRE VILLAIN A groans] [FIRE VILLAIN B] I see 'im. Up there! [OJIRO] I have to help the others. [SQUALL ZONE VILLAIN A] We found you! [SQUALL ZONE VILLAINS yell] [SQUALL ZONE VILLAINS groan] That's six of them down. We're reducing their numbers, but very slowly. I hope it helps in the long run. [KUROGIRI] I have no time for this. Be gone! [TENYA gasps] [KUROGIRI gasps] [OCHACO] I don't know what his Quirk is, but he's wearing some kinda weird armor. So he must have a physical body inside here somewhere. Now! Run, Iida! [KUROGIRI] You pest! How dare you! [TENYA grunts] [KUROGIRI] I've got you! Not so fast! [SATO grunts] [SATO grunting] [SATO] Go! [TENYA grunts] [KUROGIRI growls] [TENYA] Engine... Boost! [KUROGIRI] He's going to call for backup. [KUROGIRI] It's over. [AIZAWA groaning] [yelps] [SHIGARAKI] You can erase peoples' powers. That's irritating, but it's nothing impressive. When faced with true, devastating power, you might as well be a Quirkless child. [AIZAWA panting] [screams] [AIZAWA] He's breaking my bones like they're twigs. I'm positive I erased his Quirk. That means he's super strong, even without powers. [AIZAWA groans] [AIZAWA] I think he's as strong as All Might. [AIZAWA groans] [MINETA] No... No! I can't watch this anymore. We should be getting out of here super‐fast, shouldn't we? [TSUYU] Ribbit. [KUROGIRI] Tomura Shigaraki. [SHIGARAKI] Kurogiri, did you manage to kill Thirteen? [KUROGIRI] The rescue hero is out of commission. But there were students I was unable to disperse and one of them got outside of the facility. [SHIGARAKI] Huh?! [SHIGARAKI growling, panting] [SHIGARAKI] Kurogiri... You fool... If you weren't our warp gate, I'd tear apart every last atom in your body. [SHIGARAKI grunts] [SHIGARAKI] There's no way we can win if dozens of pros show up to stop us. It's game over. Back to the title screen. And I was looking forward to finishing this today. Damn it. Let's go home. Huh? Did I hear that right? Did he say they're gonna just leave? That's what it sounded like to me. [gasps, whimpers] Yes! That's amazing! We're safe and we don't have to fight. Uh, yeah. But... I have a real bad feeling about this, Midoriya. It seems weird that they'd retreat at this point, even if help is on the way. [IZUKU] All Might's probably coming. Don't they wanna kill him? They must know UA will beef up their security after this. So now's their best chance. What's going on here? Why is this "game over," huh? [SHIGARAKI] Oh, before we leave, let's make sure the Symbol of Peace is broken. Let's wreck his pride. [gasps] [SHIGARAKI] Let's make this hurt. [SHIGARAKI] You really are so cool... [AIZAWA grunting] [SHIGARAKI] ...Eraser Head. [AIZAWA groans] [IZUKU] Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! This guy's clearly different from the ones we fought before! I've gotta save Asui and get us outta here! You! Let her go! Now! Smash! [VILLAINS yelp] [IZUKU panting] [IZUKU] What? My arm's not broken. I can't believe it! After all that training, now's when I'm able to get a good Smash in? All right! [IZUKU gasps] Where'd he come from? Wait, hold on. It didn't... hurt him? If the villains spent so much time planning this attack, then they probably figured out a way to kill him. [IZUKU] No way... [SHIGARAKI] You're pretty powerful. This "smash" of yours... Are you one of All Might's disciples? Doesn't matter. I'm done with you now. [gasping] [IZUKU yelps] Ribbit! [IZUKU grunts, gasps] [ASHIDO, OCHACO gasp] [ALL MIGHT] Have no fear, students. I am here! Look, we're saved! Ribbit. He's here... All Might... [SHIGARAKI] Ah. Looks like our game's getting a "continue." [ALL MIGHT] Don't worry, class. I am here! [IZUKU] Next time: "All Might." [ALL MIGHT] Not to spoil things, but these evildoers are going to be hitting my weak spots pretty hard! [IZUKU] Go beyond! [IZUKU, ALL MIGHT] Plus Ultra!
