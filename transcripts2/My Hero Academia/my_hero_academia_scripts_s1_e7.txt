   [KATSUKI] Hey! Do you really think Deku has a Quirk? You saw how he threw that ball. [KATSUKI] Was he seriously just tricking me all these years? I'm gonna roast that damn nerd today! [IZUKU] He can be a real pain, sure. But his strength, and confidence, and his ambition... Not to mention his Quirk. They're all so much greater than mine. But that just means that I have to do better. I refuse to lose today. [ALL MIGHT] All right. Let's begin the indoor combat training! Team A and Team D. Your time starts now! [grunting] What's the matter, Deku? Afraid to stand up and fight me? I won't hurt you so bad they'll have to stop the fight. Just close! [IZUKU grunts] [gasps] Wow! Look at those moves! [KATSUKI] Impossible. How'd he know? He's not that good! [grunting] [yelling] [groans] You can call me Deku, but I'm not the same helpless, defenseless kid anymore! You hear me? I've changed! From now on, Deku is the name of a hero! [IZUKU] Kacchan and I grew up in the same neighborhood, so we've known each other since we were little kids. Uh... Come on! Let's fight bad guys! [BOYS] Yeah! Oh! Yeah! [IZUKU] All the other neighborhood kids followed him around. It seemed like he could do anything. And no matter what he decided to do, he was always so confident. I thought he was the coolest person I'd ever met. [IZUKU] However... After his Quirk manifested, he started to change. [KATSUKI] You're shaking in your boots, you're so scared. But you wanna fight me anyway. That's why I hate you! [IZUKU] Here's the sad truth. All men are not created equal. When I was four years old, I learned that some kids have more power than others. [TENYA] Bakugo! Come in! Give me a status report. Where are you? Just shut up and defend the weapon. I've got more important things to worry about. [TENYA] Are you forgetting what our mission is? Hello? He hung up on me! This isn't the time for radio silence. We're supposed to be partners. Argh! [KIRISHIMA] Hey, who's Bakugo talking to? I'm not hearing anything. Can we get any sound with this video? He's got a radio in his ear so he can talk to his partner. I gave it to him before the match started. Along with a map of the building. Also, this. A roll of capture tape! Wrapping this around your opponent means you've apprehended them, and they're out for the rest of the game. [ASHIDO] So, there's a 15‐minute time limit, and the good guys have no idea what floor the nuclear weapon is hidden on, right? [ALL MIGHT] Correct! Then the heroes are clearly at a disadvantage here. A big one! Real Pros have to outwit villains on a daily basis. That's life. Even when the odds aren't in our favor, we fight! ‐‐[JIRO gasps] ‐‐[KIRISHIMA laughs] All together! [ALL MIGHT, STUDENTS] Let's hear a Plus Ultra! Monsieur. He's on the move. [ALL MIGHT] Hm? [KATSUKI grunts] Ah! Uraraka! Go! [OCHACO grunts] [IZUKU grunts] Ballsy move. Think you can take me alone? [KATSUKI] He's using the capture tape! [IZUKU] Hero notebook number ten, page 18! Luckily, I got to see Eraser Head's moves in action! What'll Kacchan do now? Knowing him, he'll be impatient and try another big punch! [gasps] [IZUKU] I was right! The little guy's really good! [SERO] He's holding his own and he hasn't even used his Quirk yet! [ALL MIGHT] Not surprising. He's always been pretty good at taking action in crisis situations. [ALL MIGHT] Plus, he spent years taking notes on different heroes. He internalized everything he learned. Those lessons are in his blood now. That fanboy knowledge is paying off! And driving him forward! [IZUKU] He kicked first this time. He's switching things up so I can't predict his moves. Does that mean he's worried? [KATSUKI grunts] Get back here, Deku! [KATSUKI growls] [IZUKU] I'm not gonna be able to fight him at close range now. I need some kinda plan! Dammit! You were tricking me for years by acting weak. Bet you've been laughing behind my back, huh? [gasps] [KATSUKI growls] So where's that flashy power a' yours now? [growls] Let's see how it compares to mine. Quirk or no, you'll never beat me, Deku! [KAMINARI] That guy has some real anger issues. Kinda scary... [ALL MIGHT] Midoriya told me that Young Bakugo thinks very highly of himself. But this level of pride is something else. It may end up being his demise. [IZUKU panting] [IZUKU] Good, he's completely forgotten about my partner. Just like I thought. If they wanted to send someone out to stop us here, it should've been Iida. He's way faster, after all. [IZUKU] That probably means Kacchan's gone rogue. The two of them aren't working together as a team. If we had to take those two on head‐to‐head, our chances of winning would be pretty low. They've got such strong Quirks. I can't go after the weapon right now or Kacchan will follow me. And if we both tried to take him down, we'd probably run out of time. [IZUKU] So we stay split up for now. I have to trust Uraraka. She'll find the weapon and Iida, and then I'll join her for a two‐on‐one fight. That's how we'll win. I'll just have to capture Kacchan down here. On my own. I can do it. As long as I don't get too close to his hands. [KATSUKI] Stop hiding! [gasps] Come out and face me, you coward! [IZUKU] By the way. I've been meaning to tell you, Kacchan. You're even worse than the rest of these rejects. You really think they'd let someone like you in when they could have me? No, wait! I'm not trying to compete against you. You gotta believe me! [IZUKU] I take back everything I said. Like it or not, you can't stop me! From now on, Deku is the name of a hero! [KATSUKI] He's just a little bug. [IZUKU] Wow, you're so awesome! Whatever, this is nothin'. [IZUKU] Ow! Jeez, Izuku. You really can't do anything right, can you? Look! You can read the last part of Izuku's name as "Deku." Whoa, so you can read that? Well, obviously. Deku. That must be what you call a helpless loser who's completely useless. [BOYS laugh] Why are you being so mean, Kacchan? [KATSUKI] Why don't you understand? [BOYS] Whoa! Dude, that has to be a new record. I bet it is. Wow! Heh, cool! Where's yours? Well, uh, it sank. [BOYS laugh] [KATSUKI] Why can't you do anything right? [PRESCHOOLERS] Whoa! Awesome! You're so lucky! Yeah! Impressive. I bet you that's gonna grow into an amazing Quirk! Definitely. A flashy Quirk for a future hero. It's perfect! [KATSUKI] Yeah, you're right! I am amazing! In fact, I bet there's no one as great as I am. Wow, you're so lucky! Your Quirk is amazing, Kacchan! When I get mine, I hope it's just as cool! Whatever, Deku. No matter what power you end up with, you'll never be able to beat me. [KATSUKI] A worthless bug for me to smash. [BOY 1C] Hey, did you hear? Deku doesn't have a Quirk. Like, none. [BOY 7A] What? Really? [BOY 1C] Yeah, it's called being "Quirkless." [BOY 1B] That's dumb. [BOY 7B] What a loser. [BOY 7C] He's so lame. [PRESCHOOL TEACHER 7B] Don't worry about it, okay, Izuku? [KATSUKI] You're a total failure, Deku. Forward march and here we go, members of the Agency Bakugo. Sound o‐‐ Kacchan! Hey. You okay down there? Oh, don't worry. Kacchan is super tough! See? [KATSUKI grunts] [KATSUKI] I was just fine on my own, Deku. [BOY 1C] Hurry and get back up here! Sure! Just gimme one second. [KATSUKI] I didn't need your stupid help! Are you all right? Are you hurt? I was worried you might'a hit your head or something. [KATSUKI] But you looked at me like I was some kinda weakling. Kacchan! I couldn't just stand there and watch you die! [KATSUKI] Like you! But I'm not! I'm so much better than you are! [OCHACO] Found it. Now I just have to tell Deku. And try my best to stay outta sight until he gets up here. [gasps] [TENYA] Bakugo definitely has a villainous side. And that's exactly what we need to succeed in this mission. I need to temporarily devote myself to criminal intent. Yes. I won't fail this trial and risk bringing shame down on the Iida family name. That means... I must now embrace evil... ...to become a hero! Behold! I am the personification of villainy! [TENYA cackles] [OCHACO] He's so serious. [TENYA] Hm? Uraraka, is that you? [OCHACO gasps] Uh... [TENYA] I knew you would come here alone the instant that Bakugo ran off by himself and engaged with Midoriya. Your Quirk allows you to float anything that you touch, but I've prepared for that. By hiding every object in this room so you have nothing to use against me, do‐gooder! My dastardly tricks have rendered you helpless! You've blundered, hero! [evil laughter] He really is... playing the part. [OCHACO] Um, Deku? [IZUKU] I'm here. How's it going? [OCHACO] Iida knows that I'm here. Sorry. Right now he's monologuing. [IZUKU] Where are you? [OCHACO] Near the middle of the fifth floor. [gasps] Right above me! [IZUKU] We probably don't have much time left, now. We have to finish this fast or they win! I won't give up yet. I can capture Kacchan. I won't lose! [gasps] I'm all loaded up. What does that mean? [KATSUKI] Why aren't you using your fancy Quirk? Don't tell me you're underestimating me, Deku. Get over here and show me what you're really made of. [IZUKU] I have no choice. I have to face him. Right now! Kacchan. I'm not scared of you anymore. [growls] Heh. Since you're such a stalker, by now you probably know how my Quirk, Explosion, works. I secrete nitroglycerin‐like sweat from my hands and make it blow up. Imagine what I could do if I had a lot of it. That's right, these gauntlets aren't just for show. They've been storing up my sweat inside for one monster blast. [ALL MIGHT] No, he's going too far! Young Bakugo! Don't do it! You'll kill him! He'll be fine as long as he dodges! [IZUKU yelps] [TENYA, OCHACO yelp] ‐‐[STUDENTS gasping] ‐‐Whoa, whoa! This's nuts! Come in! Come in, Midoriya! [IZUKU grunts, pants] Is that even allowed? [KATSUKI laughs] These are awesome. The more nitro sweat that's stored in these gauntlets, the stronger the explosion is. [KATSUKI] Go ahead. Use your stupid Quirk on me, Deku. Even if you give me everything you've got, you'll never beat me. [TENYA] Bakugo. Answer me! What is going on down there? Did you cause that blast? [OCHACO] Now's my chance! If I can claim the weapon, that means we win! [TENYA gasps] [TENYA] Not so fast, Hero! [OCHACO grunts] [TENYA gasps] [OCHACO] I just have to touch the weapon. In one move, this'll all be over. [TENYA] Since when can she make herself float? Release! [OCHACO] This special move is hard, but it's worth it! [yells] [OCHACO yelps] [groans] [TENYA] Admirable attempt, but your Quirk's no threat if you can't touch anything. I can easily keep this weapon out of your reach until time runs out. [evil laughter] [OCHACO grunts] It's not over, I won't let Deku down. [KATSUKI] What's the matter? You look scared. You dodged the attack, so you can still fight, can't you? Come and get me. [IZUKU] The gauntlets make it so he can use his powers at long range. I'm not safe, even if I stay away from him. So what do I do? Come in, what's the situation? [OCHACO] It's not good! Are you ignoring me again? I'll get your attention. [KIRISHIMA] Sir, isn't this getting outta hand? That Bakugo is acting real crazy. He's gonna kill 'im! Not so. I won't hurt you so bad they'll have to stop the fight, just close! Oh, he'll be fine as long as he dodges! [ALL MIGHT] Despite his fierce posturing, he's not actually trying to kill Midoriya. But still... [ALL MIGHT] Bakugo. Use that stored‐up power again and I'll stop this fight. Your team will lose. Huh? [ALL MIGHT] To employ such a strong attack indoors is inviting the destruction of the stronghold you should be protecting. That's a poor strategy, whether you're a hero or a villain. The penalty would be a massive loss of points. [ALL MIGHT] I know that as a teacher, I should stop this fight now. But... [growling] The pillar by the window. Get there now! [gasps] [KATSUKI] We'll fight hand‐to‐hand! [IZUKU] It's no good. I can't dodge this! I'll have to counterattack! Like this! [KATSUKI grunts] [yells] [STUDENTS gasp] What was that move? He doesn't come off as a guy with a strategy. But he's actually quite intelligent. [ASHIDO] Huh? What're you talkin' about? [TODOROKI] He changed his trajectory while in midair using a blast that doubled as a smokescreen. Very clever. A feint attack like that requires an extreme amount of precision. He had to calculate the physics and demonstrate control over his Quirk. Ugh, Bakugo is uber talented. I hate it. [IZUKU grunts] [KATSUKI] Here it comes, nerd! The famous right hook you were whining about! [IZUKU screams] [KATSUKI] Deku! Don't you ever forget what you are! You're a weakling! [groans] [IZUKU] He's not giving me any time to form a strategy. I can't beat him without a Quirk after all. He's too good. [IZUKU] I have no choice. I have to use it. [ASHIDO] This is hard to watch! All he has to do is wrap tape around him, not kill him. Bakugo's certainly acting like a villain. I thought Midoriya was pretty amazing at the start of the fight, but he's completely outmatched in terms of combat power. Not to mention, Bakugo seems like a natural at all this stuff. [ALL MIGHT] I should end this. But‐‐ [pants] [ALL MIGHT] For his sake, I'll let it go on. [ASHIDO] He's running away! Not very manly, but he doesn't have a choice. He's outgunned. Unless he's got some kinda plan. It's possible... [IZUKU panting] Why won't you use your damn Quirk against me? Still think you can stop me without it? That's not it. You've been hiding your true power for years. What's the deal, Deku? Did you think you were better than me this entire time? That's what you think? [IZUKU] You idiot. You've always been stronger, Kacchan. I know that you're better than me. [grunts] [IZUKU] Can't you see? That's why I wanna beat you. Because you're amazing! [KATSUKI] You're even more of an idiot than I realized. Come at me! [ALL MIGHT] The only other time I hear that much passion in his voice is when he talks about being a hero. In order to achieve his dream, he has to do this. Not for me, but for himself! [IZUKU] Detroit... [yelling] They're gonna kill each other! Sir! [yelling] Both of you, stop‐‐! Uraraka, now! [ALL MIGHT] Hm? Right! [TENYA gasps] [IZUKU] I can't beat you. Not in a one‐on‐one fight like this. But I can win! Smash! [KATSUKI gasps] [TENYA gasps] What's happening? This is it! Sorry, Iida! Improvised special move: the Comet Home Run! [TENYA] In the name of villainy, I demand that you stop this! Release! [TENYA gasps] I got it! [TENYA gasps] [TENYA] No! The weapon! This was your big plan... ...from the very beginning, wasn't it? You were playing me this entire time, you bastard. [IZUKU] I wasn't... going to use it. [grunts] [IZUKU whimpers] Because I can't control it. My body just can't handle... the backlash of my power yet. Mr. Aizawa said I'd be useless. But this was all... that I... could think of. [KATSUKI gasps] This is the only way... I had any chance at winning. [KATSUKI grunts] You did it. [ALL MIGHT] The hero team... [ALL MIGHT] ... wins! [ALL MIGHT] You kids still have a lot to learn, but I'll help you hero up! [IZUKU] Next time: "Bakugo's Start Line"! [ALL MIGHT] Young Bakugo's going to get all teary‐eyed on us! [IZUKU] Go beyond!
