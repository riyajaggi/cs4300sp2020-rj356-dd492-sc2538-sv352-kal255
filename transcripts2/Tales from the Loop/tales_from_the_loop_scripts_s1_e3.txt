 That wonderful feeling of excitement. I love you. MAY: Why does it always pass? [Stacey laughs] ZHI: How's Jakob? Good. Good.

 [insects trilling] [insects trilling] [bird calling] [car alarm chiming] [Zhi sighs] [car door closes] [seat belt clicks] [radio static] MAN: single assumption that makes the progress of biology... [engine starts] assumption that everything the animals do, the atoms do. That some things that are seen in the biological world are the result of the behavior of physical and chemical phenomena with no extra assumptions. You could always say, "Well, when it comes to living things, anything can happen." But if you do that, you never understand the living thing. Very hard for us just to believe that the wiggling of the tentacle of the octopus is nothing but a performing round of atoms putting into motion the laws. But it's investigating this hypothesis... ♪ ♪ You're not dressed. MAN [over radio]: is known to be the same as the matter on the Earth by the character of the light that's emitted by those stars which is a similar kind of frequency... [radio shuts off] MAN: Uh, what goes on outside the nucleus of the atom seems precise and complete enough in the sense that given enough time, we can calculate anything as accurately... ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [Jakob hisses] - Sorry. - [Stacey laughs] [Stacey and Jakob laugh] Thanks.

He was shot by a jealous husband and survived but later died in a freak hot-air balloon accident. [sighs] You're not like this at school. Usually, you're really quiet. Yeah.

Uh... - LUCAS: Hey. - What is that? LUCAS: Yeah. They're the, uh, main heat-absorbing component. - They get really hot. - Yeah. That's why the, uh, side arm is needed. Interesting. And then you got the coolant that needs to get replaced. The weather, it could, uh, really do a number on them. Then there's the, uh... uh... [stammers] timer itself that needs to be reset. -Uh, thanks for explaining all that. -[clears throat] - LUCAS: Yeah. - Uh, have a good one. - You, too. - Bye. Okay. [quietly]: You take something? What's that for? This was just in the lake? Yep. Is it dangerous? Probably. Where do you learn this stuff? I've always been curious about how things work, so... I take stuff apart and put it back together. I-It's kind of weird. ETHAN: No, it's cool. Can I see your room? Nice. This...? Yeah. Uh, it's nothing. What? Uh, it's just... I can't draw, but... you're prettier than that. Want to listen to a song? Sure.
