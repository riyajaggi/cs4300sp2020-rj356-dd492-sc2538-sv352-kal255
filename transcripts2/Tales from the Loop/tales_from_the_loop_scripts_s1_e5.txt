 - Mm-mm. - Okay. Oh, wait. You know... I've got it right here. Yeah. Yeah, must have got through. Hey! Hey, kid! Hey, kid, I'm talking to you! I heard someone broke into Munro's house. - Really? - Yeah. I wonder if it's the same guy that broke into my place. What? When? Little while ago. I didn't tell you? - No. - I thought I did. I was even home at the time. Did they take anything? Not really. Wonder what they wanted. I don't know. Messed up, right? Can't believe you didn't tell me about this. - I thought I did. - You didn't. I changed the locks, but it's freaky. You know? Not feeling safe in your own home. Yeah. We're talking about your neighbors, your friends, your coworkers. These are the people that need to think about how they're going to take care of themselves and their families when a disaster happens and they are without resources. You want to make it through what is coming. - Hey! - Come on, let's go! Okay. It's okay. It's okay. Hey. Hey, hey. Oh. Why weren't you with her? I can't be with her every single second. Why not?! It's not safe! My God. Don't you dare blame me. This is not my fault. Then whose is it? I can't control everything. You know that? This is... Bad things happen. But they don't have to! Not to us. Not anymore. Come on. Who's there? I saw you. No! Hey! Who was it? Was there somebody? They were, uh... They? He. He was right here. He was here, and then he hopped the fence. Did you get a good look at him? No, not really. I hear there's been a few break-ins recently. Were they attempting to get inside the house? I, uh... The front door was open. What? Do you think they'd been inside? Ed? I don't know. Maybe. Jesus. Are any possessions missing or...? - He was watching our daughter. - Kate. Please, lower your voice. I'm not gonna lower my voice. - Ma'am. - Oh, don't "ma'am" me. They're trying to help. Yeah, I don't want them to help. I want them to fix it. What are you going to do? We'll ask the neighbors if they saw anyone. That's not good enough. What would you have us do? - Catch him. - Kate. We'll start by talking to your neighbors. Your daughter didn't recognize him? No. He was standing right out there. Yeah, you told us that. What are we supposed to do, then, tonight? Try to get some sleep. But I don't feel safe here. We'll do what we can. What? What? I can keep you safe. Did you hear me? Kate? I heard you. Morning. Morning. There's a... I have an issue. An issue? At home. A bit of a... Oh. Uh... I wanted to know if I could get an advance. I see. To take care of... At-at home. Of course, right. Hmm. Yeah, should be fine. Yeah. Happy to help. Here you go. What's it for? Protection. I can keep you safe. Were you out there all night? There anything? - Did you sleep? - Mm-hmm. Good. Ed for office. Over. Phil here. Over. Yeah, I'm at, uh, Field Hat, Apple, Cleveland, zero, three, seven. Over. Yeah. Over. Malfunction sent in error. False alarm. Over. Error noted. Over. Hi. You know, my son's pretty good on the guitar. I'm-I'm gonna... I'm gonna get another coffee. You want anything? I'm good. Thanks, though. Yeah. If this guy comes back... what will you do with him? What do you mean? If he comes back... again. Yeah? Do you think you'd... grab him? Do you think you'd kill him? Maybe. Really? What would you do? I wouldn't do anything. I didn't. Well, you don't have a family. But what if he's not violent? He might just want money. He was watching my daughter. I just... speaking for myself... I couldn't handle killing someone. Mentally. In reality. Then we're different. You don't have a family. - I know. - No, you don't! - I meant the... - You don't have a single idea of what it's like... the responsibility. -Ed. Ed. -The weight when something happens, something awful to one of your very own... I'm gonna put a few songs in. Should be getting back to it. One, then. Ed, is everything okay? Oh, my... I told you. Oh, not now. Shit. This is really dangerous. You need to fix this, all right? You think I don't know that? Hey, where's Beth? And after the hospital bills? We're short. On what? Everything. We need the lights back on. I'll do it. Couple days work. With what money? I'll ask Henry. No. I'll figure it out. What about the Scrapper? What about it? No one's been back out there. Yeah, because of the Scrapper. Okay, you're barely sleeping. The Scrapper stays. Look, Kate. - I need it. - So, you're just gonna be outside every night? For how long? I don't know. Look... - Oh, Ed... - I'll sell the car. - I'll... What? - This is not all on you. Well, of course it is. Hi, there. Anything on those break-ins? We're here because we got some calls. People are concerned. - Yeah? - About this. What about it? I'm not doing anything illegal. No. You're not. Then what is there to talk about? There are issues. Safety issues. For you and your neighbors. People have concerns. Yeah, you said that. No one mentioned anything to me. Look, you can understand why they might be a little afraid. This thing is keeping the neighborhood safe. They have nothing to worry about. Be that as it may... So...? So, we came to tell you that we're gonna be monitoring the situation. Moving forward. By all means, monitor. Look... We're not hurting anyone. Not yet. We told you what we told you. And I heard you. I can hear you. Come out! Now! - What is it? - Shh! - Did you get him? - I don't know. Kate. - What is wrong with you? - I didn't know. - You could have killed her. - She... I didn't... What's she doing...? She's supposed to be inside. I didn't know! What the hell's she doing out here?! A lot's going wrong. What? More than usual. Guess these things happen. Hello? Kate? Henry, hi. Yeah. Is Kate there? Uh-huh. Yeah, is she... Can she hear? It... Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, she knows. She knows I called. Hey, Danny. It's Dad. I don't know if you can hear me right now, but if, um... I fix things. That's what I do. Done it my whole life. If I have a purpose, that's what it is, so... But I can't fix this. I thought I was gonna keep you safe forever, but I can't. And I'm so sorry. Mm. I'm so sorry I let you down. Okay? Hi. How are you? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And Beth? Good. Good. Is, uh... Will... will you come home? I-I... I want to sh... Uh, there's something I want to show you. Please. Let me show you. Come on. Where's the Scrapper? It's gone.
