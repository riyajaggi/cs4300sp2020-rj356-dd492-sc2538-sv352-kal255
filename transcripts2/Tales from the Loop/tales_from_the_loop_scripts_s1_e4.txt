 - What do you do? - Mm? Underground? You know when someone says something's impossible? Yeah. I prove it's possible. Hmm? Cole. Your father's here. Come on.

 Any time. - Hey, Grandpa. - Huh? Come, look. Loretta would love this one. Oh. It's sweet. Your grandson forgot to punch air holes in the jar. Here. Has she called yet? Not yet. Morning. Hi. Hello. Oh. Hello, Doctor. Cole. What was my dad like at my age? Oh, I was working long hours then. You see that? Come on. Don't be afraid. It do something? Yeah. What? Call out. Go on. Stand about there. Go on. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? That voice is you as an old man. This place, it tells how long your life will be. Call again. Count this time. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? That's good. You're gonna have a long life. See if you can beat six. O-Oh, it's not a game. Just try. Okay. Hello? - Is it broken? - No. - Then what's wrong? - Nothing. Cole, I... I have to tell you something. Cole. Cole! Cole. Did the doctors say how long? Depends, but not long. - So what will you do? - Do? I'm not sure there's much to do. You're not sure? Cole. The doctor is, though. The doctor is what? Sure. I remember that doctor as a little girl. Dr. Ballard. So odd that that little girl would be the one that gives us this news. Well, she is not a little girl anymore, Klara. No, I know that, but she was. - What's your point? - Can we, uh, get you something? A glass of water? - No. - No. We just wanted you to know. We wanted you to know the situation. Of course. How are you being so calm about this? - These things happen. - Well, yeah, but - you still... - Okay. What-what-what can we do? Oh. Russ? As I said before, there's nothing to do. We-we-we just wanted you to know. Of course. Right. Cole? Go away. - Cole? - Go away! Cole, you don't talk to me like that. Open the door. I didn't think you were gonna open it. Sit. You know, my father passed when I was your age. Everybody stood about, talking. I remember thinking nobody's keeping the body company. It's all by itself in the corner. Maybe there's something underground. To save you. No. Impossible. Then make it possible. Where do you go when you die? In an urn. What's that? - Well, it's like a vase. - For flowers? Yeah, but for people. You wouldn't fit. Well, they reduce your body to ash. - Who does? - The people who do it. But... where do you go? You don't exist anymore. Are you asking about some kind of afterlife? There's no reason to think there is one. - But there could be. - All right. If there was, what would I look like? - Like you. - What, I'd have a face? Eyes? Ears? A mouth? But my body would've gone. You'd have a new one. What age would I be? Whatever age you are now. Well, that doesn't sound like much fun. Then you'd be young. - Why? Maybe you wouldn't have a body. Maybe... - you'll be like some kind of... - Cole. I never took a sick day - in my life. - Neither have I. Well, I guess you saved them all up for now. Bad joke. How old were you there? I was 25. Yeah, this, uh, this place was just an idea then. Full of potential. Does it feel like a long time ago? Blink of an eye. - Your wedding... - Mm. That was a long time ago. Still, I... I should've gone. You didn't think much of me at the time. No. No, I didn't. Your son would want to hear that, about you going. Perhaps. Sit. The Loop, is it what you've always wanted? - It is. - Just like your mother. And you? I thought it was. Someone will need to be here, to lead all this when I'm gone. I've spoken to the board. It's yours if you want it. I do... want it. Good. Good. I thought this place would fall apart without me sitting here at the desk, but it won't, will it? Some unsolicited advice? Please. Even though you won't, take a sick day now and then. You'll wonder where all that time went, all that potential. Blink of an eye. Hey. - You feeling okay? - Huh? - I mean, today? - Oh. I'm fine, just fine. You come here to see me? No, I, uh, I... well, I want to take Cole somewhere. Oh. Yeah, for a drive. - A drive? - Yeah. Oh. I see. Cole? Cole? - I'm just gonna go grab him. - Oh. Cole? Oh, you go ahead of me. Go on, I'm-I'm right behind you. - Can't see anything. - No? Too dark. Here. Uh-huh. Remember, you can always find light in the dark. Hmm? Cole. Aah! See, I knew you wouldn't die. Oh... Ah... Oh... Oh. Hi. Did you eat? We should put something here. Like what? Mm. Something. I don't know him, but I love him. He's from Los Angeles. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Eric Gale. Well... Say you have a dog, okay? You're trying to train him. Okay? You know, you kind of toned it... Grandpa's in the hospital. Dead? Not yet. - Come with me. - Where? We're gonna save him. They won't let you in. There's another way. In the field. This is dumb. Anything is possible down there. What's that supposed to mean? Fine. I'll do it alone. Cole. Cole. Cole! You could have gotten hurt. What were you trying to do? I thought there was something. - Something... - To help Grandpa. I know you love your grandfather, but... - this is... - That thing in the room, it's made from the same stuff that girl had. The one looking for her mom. Could it cure him? - That's, uh... - That's not what it's for, Cole. Then what's the point? - The point? - Of all of this. Make it possible. Hey! Look, your grandfather built the Loop to do many things, but what you want... it's not one of them. We may not like it, but dying is, uh, is just part of life. The very last part. I'm sorry. I want to see him. I know you do, buddy, but I don't think that's a good idea right now. We'll see. But for now, just go home. What happened? - Did you tell on me? - No. Eventually. I just wish he would die already. I want to see Grandpa. Before we go in, I need you to promise me something, okay? Your grandfather. Remember him how he was. Not as he is. Can you do that? Okay. Hey, Dad? - Dad? - What? Look who's here. Here, come on, closer. It's Cole, your grandson. When? Cole. Come on. Hi. Klara. Klara, it's raining. - Dad, it's not raining. - Klara, we should... - we should go. Mom's gonna be here soon. Come on, it's raining. - Dad, it's okay. - Let's go, come on. - It's okay. - Come on! Dad, it's okay. - Cole, wait outside. - No. Klara. Klara. Klara. Klara... Jakob? Jakob. What happened? It's not fair. What? I can't save him. Hello? We'll be over soon. Oh, that's not necessary. Thank you. Okay. Dad? Your grandmother was there. He wasn't alone. Um, I'm sorry for your loss. Um, thank you. - Hungry? - Sure. We've got so much food... It was your grandpa that died. Right? Yeah. Is he buried or cremated? Cremated. Why? Curious. What would you rather? For you. I don't know. Me? I'd rather be buried. Like my mom. Your mom died? Yeah. Sorry. Want to help? Sure. Your father's outside. What did Grandpa do in here? He never told me. Come on. Hey. Hey. Thank you for looking after him. Oh. For Loretta. Oh. She'll love it. George? The toilet broke again. Um, I'll have someone come take a look at it. Nice, isn't it? Yeah. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?
