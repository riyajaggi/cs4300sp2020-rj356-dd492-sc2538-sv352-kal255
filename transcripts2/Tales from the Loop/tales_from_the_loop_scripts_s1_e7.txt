 What's it look like? Oh, it's big, and its claws can tear through anything. Even bone? That's why no one goes there. Well, how'd it get out there? Yeah. Uh, my sister didn't say. It just came from underground and murdered people. - When? - A long time ago. Underground? The Loop. It murdered them. Who? The people.

 So they just left it there. Well, wh-why didn't they just kill it? Let's find out. What do you say? You in? My dad told me never to go out there. Stop that. Then let's go. Yeah, come on. It'll be fun. What's it doing here? Maybe it's how the monster got out here. Why leave the canoe? That's why. Anything? There. Wait! Stop! Say hi to the monster for me! George! George! George! Hey, George! Wait! Wait! Wait. Your mother's here to take you home. George! Hey! You there? Come on, let's go. Getting on? When you were out there, on the island... did you see something? Anything? Did you tell anyone? You should not have gone there. I know. But now that you have and saw what you saw, don't. Don't what? Tell anyone. Ever. Okay. Promise? Promise. Good. Try it again. Whenever you're ready. Good. Now rotate. You were talking in your sleep again. Yeah? What did I say? You were upset. About what? I keep meaning to put a pad by the bed and write it down. Hmm. I'll see you tonight. Mm-hmm. Cole? Cole. What are you doing? Uh, just... Cole, this isn't a toy. You could've gotten hurt. What's it for? Nothing. Then why have it? Let's go. This old model is a real workhorse. There are new ones. More... advanced. Any interest? Uh, uh, I kind of like that one. It's mine, and... yeah. Well, when we're done here, it should be good as new. One second. Hello. Yes. I'll be open until 5:00 tonight. And 6:00 tomorrow. Uh, Laurel, honey? Honey, come back here. Sorry. No, it's okay. See? There's nothing to be afraid of. It's just different. I never told the boys what happened. Did they ask? I think they're afraid to. So tell 'em. A snake bite went septic. Doesn't have to be some big mystery. Right? Yeah, right. Good? - Yeah. - How are the kids? Good. Jakob starts at the Loop soon. - Hmm. - Yeah, panel repair. Just as a place to begin. I was wondering, did Dad ever talk about the island? And what was out there? - Because he never did with me, not really. - No. You two never did talk very much. Would you like some more iced tea? No, I'm fine, thanks. So, did he? Ever say anything? Why? Because he isn't here anymore. No, he isn't. What was out there was like a child to him. But people wouldn't accept it. What he made. He made it? It was alive. In its own way. It still is. How do you know? I just do. All this time, alone. Poor thing. Poor thing? Do you have any idea what happened to me out there? Why didn't he just kill it? It was the first. I... He knew the next would have to be more like... More like what? Like us. So he put it on a boat. You should not have gone there. He felt so guilty. But he realized that it was too different. People don't like things that are different. So, Dad put it out there so it wouldn't hurt anybody? No. He put it out there so no one would hurt it. Do you recognize me? My, uh... my father... he made you. He put you on a boat. To hide you here. Keep you s... To keep you safe. Uh... I'm sorry. Sorry for hurting you. I didn't know. It's all right. No, no, it's all right. It's all right. I'm not gonna... Here.
