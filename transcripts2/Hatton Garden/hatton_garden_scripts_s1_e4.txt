 And what if the job ain't finished? It's finished. All we gotta do is push that cabinet over... No! Are you stupid or something? Carl! Where you going? I'm done, Dan. As soon as Brian pulled out this job, it was finished. Look, look, look, look. I wish I could take a selfie! Send it to Brian, saying, "Here, look, this is how you left us!" I'm sorry to tell you, Mr Syrus, yours was one of the boxes that was broken into. Are you taking any of the tom?

 I might if I knew who was gonna be handling it. Basil thinks Brian should have a share. Over my dead body, mate. I'll deal with Brian, and it'll be fair. Is this it? Don't be talking to anyone about this. Keep your mouth shut! There's still a lot of stuff left over that Kenny's gonna look after. What are you gonna do now? I'm out of here. You keep away from him, Brian. He sets himself up as the master. Well, how about the camera in front of your eyes? Stop coming round here, mate! I mean it! All I want, Kenny, and I want you to pass this message on, is what's rightfully mine. We have another vehicle to focus on. An 11-plate white Mercedes. Find that Merc, and we find the owner.

 DOOR SHUTS Come on, then. Here. WOMAN: He's on the move. 10:42. Getting into his car with his dog. Coming out onto Cropley Street. Stand by. He's turning left, left, left onto Rushton Street. We have eyeball. MAN: Turning left. He's slowing down. He's stopped. The car is stationary. 'He's walking his dog again. 'Still won't get out of the car.' Whoa, there you go. Come on. Give. Come on. He has the most boring lifestyle in the world. Be a good boy now. Dad won't be long. 'Do you have eyeball?' He's by himself again. He's Billy No Mates. Walk the dog, coffee. Walk the dog, coffee... You've got to be kidding me. What? It's all genuine. I ain't arguing that. It's just... ..I've got a good idea where you got it from. I watch the news, Terry. How much more have you got? Plenty. Why ain't you using Brian to handle all this? He's not involved in this one. Pity. Cos the problem is... ..it's all too hot, mate. The dealers are all looking out for it. They'll have photos of the stuff that's been nicked. The best I can do for you, mate, would be... ..50%. 50? Fuck off. No. Brian's very thorough. He knows exactly where to place something like this so nobody'll recognise it. Unless you know all the dealers and what to take where, all I can do is take out the stones and melt down the gold, and give you the scrap value. 50... Yeah. You're having me over. You know you are. Dan, will you fuck off and stop coming around? I've brought some steaks. And I had to find out how it went with Shorty. Brian said he'd do it for 20% commission. Max, 25. How come Shorty's double that? He's a decent bloke, Shorty. He'd never stripe me. Yeah. 50? Jesus...! I half wish Brian was still with us. Well, he ain't. Right... Thank you. Yeah. No, I've got it all under control, all right? Don't worry about it. I'll push Shorty down. I'll tell him, 30 or no deal. 40, max. Yeah, we've got him. He's headed for the park again. Come on, Dempsey. Come on, mate. Here you are. That's it. 'Hang on... red letter day. 'He's actually getting out the car and giving his dog a proper walk.' KENNY: What's this? Whay...! I want to know what he's sayin' about me. I haven't been able to speak to him since the divvy-up. I told you to go round and tell him that I wanted to speak to him. Yeah, I know, but I've been thinking about that, and I can't. We're not supposed to see each other for another six months. We're playing with fire talking to you now, me and you. 'Are they talking to each other?' I don't know. I can't tell at this distance. I want my fucking share. I fought your corner, Brian. I swear to God. You ask Basil. But it's not up to me, is it? Terry's calling the shots now. Terry Perkins can't call nothing. He's too dim. You tell him, if he won't meet me... I'll come round his house. And if he wants to fuck me over, he can do it to my face. Other bloke's walking off. IC1 male. 70s, I'd guess. 'It's one of the most daring heists in living memory, 'in London's most exclusive jewellery district. 'This is not a victimless crime. 'The box holders we're dealing with are mainly small businesses, 'and they're not making huge profits. 'People face losing their homes. 'There's a tendency to think how audacious, how clever the raid was. 'But it's ruined lives.' 'And finally and exclusively, you wanted to announce a reward?' 'We're offering a reward of Â£20,000 'for information leading to the conviction 'of the gang responsible for this crime.' 20 grand? That's insulting. It's pocket money. I think it's good news. They usually offer fortunes. We're on a clear run here, mate. Amu, shall I make you a cup of tea? No. Thank you. We had a call earlier from the lady at the London Diamond Bourse. She's offering to help everybody with their insurance claims. Good. Wait, wait, one more. Bull's-eye. 50. There's 20 grand in there. You don't know what that means to me, mate. I felt so bad for walking away like that. My head weren't right, Dan. You know that. What, with me... What, with me guts and... We did something special, Dan, didn't we? And to be forgiven by you, well... ..I couldn't ask for more. You ain't forgiven. That's to keep your mouth shut, OK? You let me down, Carl. Big time. HE SCOFFS Oh, she's grade two, you know, not one. She's so good at it. Isn't she? Look, I've got a picture on my phone here, of the last show she did. Hang on. I'll show you. It's in the car. Terry Perkins. I've got a message for you. What do you mean you've got a message? Who are you? Kenny sent me. Who's he? Oh, it's... go back, love. Just wait over there, will you? What the hell do you think you're playing at, eh? I'm here with my family. Kenny said to let you know someone wants to meet. That's all he said. They never actually look at each other. What was your impression? I think we got excited because it's a slight change of routine that day. But it's probably just two old boys on a park bench. We'll have to reassess what the surveillance on Collins is giving us. Another couple of days, I think that's probably it. Move the resources elsewhere. He's gone past the turn-off for the park. Continuing south. 'He must be going straight to the cafe. 'South on Farringdon Lane. 'Expect a left, left, left turn onto Clerkenwell Green.' Wait. He's driving straight past. CAR HORN BLARES 'He's jumped the lights.' We cannot follow. We need someone to leapfrog. We're held at the lights. We've lost him. He's turned right onto Britain Street. He's turned right, right, right, and he's heading west on Benjamin Street. '60-second delay.' 'The vehicle is slowing.' The vehicle is stationary 'in a turn off Benjamin Street.' 'Heading there now on foot.' 'Is anyone else near Benjamin Street? '24, can you make a pass down there immediately?' 'Negative. We're still a couple of minutes away.' '22, give your location.' I'm at his vehicle. There's nobody in it. 'Has anybody got eyeball?' 'Negative.' 'Negative.' 'I need eyeball.' 'OK, the target is off-grid. Location unknown. 'He's in an area around Farringdon Station.' 'Come on, someone must have him.' Negative. 'He hasn't come this way yet.' 'Bollocks!' Wait. I've got him. He's going into the pub with another male, IC1, 70s. It could be the same guy from the park. Here, I've got you a vodka and tonic. Thanks. Yeah, well, I know that's what you like. Cheers. So, what do you want to see me about? You know... why I want to see you. I'm entitled to a share. I planned that job from the ground up. Every tiny little detail. Yeah, but you walked away. Yeah, you and Carl. Oh, fuck Carl. I got the blueprints to the building. I worked out how to get us in. I got Basil on the alarms. This is my job. That is true, to be fair. It was your job. I deserve a share. You're telling me you're gonna give him a full share for fucking falling asleep, you're gonna give me nothing? Oh, hang on a minute! Shut up. Without me, you would never have got in there. But we was two men down. I nearly keeled over in there, I nearly pegged it. If it weren't for Dan, I'd be done. Where was you? You was fast a-kip indoors. What are you going to do with the tom? I ain't decided yet. I can do it all for 35 commission. 35? Mm-hm. I thought you were gonna do it for 25. Yeah, well, that was before you tried to stiff me. 35. That is the best deal you mugs will get. Better than you'll get from fucking Shorty. What's he going to do, melt it down? Well, that's what he's told you. Well, it ain't just Shorty, is it? There are other options. THEY LAUGH Who are the others, hey? Mickey Mouse and Pluto? THEY LAUGH You can't go with Shorty, Tel. Is that right? Where's the rest of the gear right now? With Kenny? Yeah, with me. It probably makes sense for you to have a look over it at some point. See what we've got. The sooner the better. Have a look over it all and take your share at the same time. What do you think, Tel? Give us a minute, Kenny, will you? Yeah. I'll, er... I'll leave you to it. I'll tell you what I'll do, Brian. Erm... I came here to clear this up so it's not hanging over us. You need me, Terry. No offence, but you try and do this without me, it'll blow up in your face. Right, well... ..so, this is what I'll give you out of the pot, all right? Fuck all. That's what you're getting. Fuck all. You are making a big mistake. You're still trying to lord it up. Years I've had to put up with your shit. But I came here today ready to cut you in. But all you've done is just remind me what an arrogant fuckin' arsehole you are. I told you I needed this job. I told you I was skint. But you don't give a fucking monkey's about me, do you? You don't want to be making an enemy out of me, Terry. I wouldn't start making threats, old son. You're gonna have to do better than that. Oh, go on, get out of my fucking sight. You are gone, mate. You're gone. You... You can bellyache as much as you like. You still ain't getting fuck all. TERRY SCOFFS Armita... I have to tell you something... ..that has been weighing very heavily on me. I have been trying to make economies... ..in order that we might improve our finances. As we pay the annual fee for the deposit box... ..I took the decision that we could save money on... ..insurance premiums. Just until Asal leaves college. What are you saying? That I'm a very foolish man... ..and a bad husband. We're not insured. Not for any of the stuff that's been stolen from us. I'm so sorry. HE SOBS I've lost us everything. HE SOBS I think we have our key players. On the right, Terrence George Perkins. 67. Plenty of form. He's a violent armed robber. Part of a gang that poured petrol over a security guard, then threatened to set him alight. Sentenced to 22 years in 1983 for his part in the Security Express robbery. And when he was banged up in Parkhurst, he met the guy on the left, Brian Henry Reader, 76 years old. Brink's-Mat. Stood trial with Kenneth Noye for the murder of an undercover police officer. Both were acquitted. What are they talking about? The audio's drowned out by background noise. But the lip reader got most of it. Three other names mentioned as being on the job. Basil, alarms man. Dan. And then someone called Carl, who also didn't go back to the vault on the second night. Shall we pull 'em? Leave them in play. The only way to build a cast-iron case is to get them and the proceeds together in the same place. I want probes in their cars, and I want to get into their phones. I couldn't agree with you more, Brian. It's just not fair. And now he's come out and said what he said, my hands are tied. I can't just give you a share, can I? I'm not saying that. All I want is a little bit off the top of the gear you're looking after, that's all. You know that's fair. They'll notice. You said yourself, the divvy-up isn't for another six months. How are they going to know what was in them bags? They haven't even looked in them. Oh, come on, now, Kenny. You owe me that much, old pal. I shouldn't have lost my temper. I feel like I've given him the upper hand. No way. When you listen to him... you know, demanding this, demanding that. No, you're well shot of him, Tel. You've done the right thing. I should have played along until we'd divvied it all up. 'All I've done is put him on notice that he's not gonna get a share.' 'Calm down. 'You'll get worked up like this. 'You know it ain't gonna do you any good.' 'Hello?' Hello, Jan. It's Kenny. Is Billy there? 'No, he's away, Ken.' What do you mean? 'He's in Spain.' BANGING ON DOOR I need to talk to him about something. 'Well, you'll probably get him on his mobile.' Look, I've got to go. I'll call you later. 'All right, bye.' I'll call back. BANGING ON DOOR What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here! I've come for the gear. He wants to move it. Where is it? It ain't here. What do you mean? Where is it, Kenny? It's with my brother-in-law. He's looking after it for me. I was never going to stash it here. Who's your brother-in-law? Billy. You brought somebody else in on this without asking me first? I can trust him. He's the fella I sent with the message about Brian. How do you know he ain't got his hands in them bags? Well, he wouldn't. What do you mean, he wouldn't? It's human fucking nature! Right, let's go round there right now and see him. You can't. He's on holiday. You've been talking to Brian, haven't you? I haven't. I swear on my life, I haven't. I'm bringing the divvy-up forward. I want it on Friday. What? Bad idea, Tel. Very bad idea. I don't even know if he'll be back by then. I don't give a fucking monkey's! My daughter's going on holiday. We'll do it at her place. One o'clock, Friday. And you make sure you bring the gear. All of it. So he's told this Bill... who the fuck has Bill told? Everyone. The whole fucking world. That's why we need to move quickly. 'I suppose I'd better let Basil know. Wherever the fuck he is.' Why? HE HUMS MERRILY PHONE RINGS It's me. Terry's bringing the divvy-up forward. What? When to? 'Tomorrow.' You're kidding? Can you put it off? 'I've tried that. I'm not sure what to do.' Well, you've got to go. If you don't, they'll just nick your share. This is bad practice. There's no way we should be anywhere near the gear until Christmas at the earliest. It's not healthy. If you're not there, you'll never see your share again. That's a guarantee. Terry's got no scruples. 'I'll be in touch.' You dropped me right in it, Bill. Right in it, mate. 'Well, I didn't know you wanted it back so quick.' 'What happened to six months?' You should have told me you was going away. I looked a right prick not knowing where the gear was. 'Don't panic, I'll get a flight back tonight.' Where is it? 'I've got it in the garden shed.' Well, I need it first thing Friday. 'No problem.' Fucking arsehole. Jesus... Shit! When were you going to tell me? I was gonna call you. We need to bring our get-together forward. I just need ten minutes with them bags before you take them to Terry and Danny. You'll take all the good stuff. I know you will. And they'll notice. No, they won't. And it's me they'll take it out on. I'll just cream off a couple of high-value pieces. And, listen, whatever I take, I'll split with you 50-50. And you know I'll get a good price for it. 'He's slowing down. 'He's stopped. 'Vehicle is stationary in Franklin Road residential area.' 'Yeah, I think his daughter lives there.' All right? Yeah. Come on, come on. All right! They're heavy. Right, I've got it, I've got it. Got it? Yeah. Quick as you can, mate, come on. Yeah, all right, I am. Jesus! That's it, come on. Yeah, well, it's heavy, innit? There. All present and correct. Right, see you later. You wanna calm down. You'll wind up having a heart attack, mate. HE SIGHS HEAVILY PHONE RINGS Hello? I'm ten minutes away. All clear? 'Yeah. 'But hurry up, will you?' I'll call you when I'm round the corner. CAR DOOR OPENS Hello, Kenny. What are you doing here? Just wanted to make sure all the gear was safe. You're early. Unlike you. Shall we get going, then? Yeah, OK. I'll see you there, hey? No, no, we're staying with you. Extra security. What's up, Kenny? PHONE RINGS Aren't you going to answer it? I'll tell you what, mate, I'll answer it. What was the name of that pub again? Kenny? I told you before, Brian. Fuck all! 'That's all you're getting.' TERRY HANGS UP He kept on and on at me. I thought I'd meet him and clear the air. I weren't going to let him have nothing. You know that, Tel. Left here. Just over there on the right. But don't go on the drive. I don't want the neighbours seeing. We'll go round the corner. Here, here. OK. Right. Shall we wait for Basil? No, bollocks to him. He can't be bothered to turn up on time. No, no, let's give him a few more minutes. I want him to be able to tell "The Master" what he's missing out on. PHONE RINGS 'Hello?' It's me. I'm on my way there. 'Basil, thank fuck.' Listen to me, you've got to argue my case. He's trying to cut me out of it. I'm gonna end up with nothing. Where are you? 'Tell him I'll do it for 20%.' 15, if I have to. Tell him that. Why are you letting him get to you like this? I can't have him beat me. Franklin Road is just up on the left, mate. He's totally incompetent. All he's ever done is hang on to other people's shirt tails. He hasn't got a brain of his own. What's happened between you and Brian? You used to be good friends. HE SCOFFS Oh, please, God, I've got a few years left. The people I see, I have to say, in my opinion, to be true... ..he's a cunt. You get too close to someone, you can't see what they're really like. Sucking the life out of you. Feeding off your ideas. He's a leech! Oh, it's taken all this for me to finally see him for what he really is. A fucking tyrant. He's on a power trip. He asked for the meeting this side of the river so I'd come on over. I sit with him in the pub, but all he's interested in is putting one over on me. 'Wait a minute, you went to meet him? 'In a public place?' Arrogant prick! He thinks he can get the better of me. He thinks he's better than me. Yeah. That's been the problem all along. 'You should have told me you met him. Sorry, Brian.' BASIL HANGS UP Hello? Er, drive on. I've changed my mind. Sorry. I'll tell you what I feel now... ..having put him in his place. I feel, er... Oh, fuck, what's the word? Free. DOOR CRASHES OPEN Police! Get on the floor! YELLS Police! Police! Get on the floor! Get down! Get down! POLICE SHOUTING What have you done, the pair of you?! Don't move! Police! Hands on your head! On your knees! Down to the floor! Hands on your back! Don't move! All right, you've made your point. We worked out it must be yours, from the description you gave. My initials were on the pouch. We only recovered the property yesterday. From underneath a gravestone, actually. Thank God for smiling on us... Do you mind putting these on? A red velvet pouch initialled GSKC, containing one diamond necklace? That's correct. I'm guessing they've taken the diamonds out of the necklace to sell them individually. These are not my diamonds. No, I see them. Perhaps you're mistaken. They're not my diamonds. They are cut in a different way to the ones we're using on that necklace. These are somebody else's property. You could have just said they were yours. Our property was stolen and we cannot pay back our creditors. You could have said they were ours. No-one would have known. I would have known. I would have known for the rest of my days.
