 SHARI! SHARI! SHARI! CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS IN MAY OF 1985, I WAS 21 YEARS OLD. MY MOM CALLED. AND SHE SAID MY SISTER, SHARI, IS MISSING. "YOU NEED TO COME HOME RIGHT NOW, PACK A BAG. AN AUTHORITY IS GONNA PULL UP IN A SQUAD CAR AND BRING YOU HOME." AS I SAT IN THE CAR, I JUST REMEMBER THINKING, "WHEN I GET HOME, PLEASE LET SHARI BE OKAY." THE MOMENT THAT I SEE MY MOTHER'S FACE, I KNOW. SHE LOOKS SCARED TO DEATH,

 WORRY IN HER EYES LIKE I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE. OH, DAWN, THANK GOD YOU'RE HOME. MOM, I'M SO SORRY. WHEN YOU TOLD ME ON THE PHONE, IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM REAL. WE SAW HER COME HOME FROM THE POOL PARTY. BUT SHE JUST NEVER CAME BACK INSIDE. WHOA! YEAH, NICE JOB, TRISTAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU OKAY? -YEAH, I'M GOOD. EARLIER THAT DAY, SHARI AND RICHARD, HER BOYFRIEND, WERE HAVING A POOL PARTY, CELEBRATING GRADUATION. IT WAS ABOUT 2:30 THAT AFTERNOON. SHE CALLED MOM TO SAY SHE WAS ON HER WAY HOME. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE ALWAYS DID. MY DAD HAPPENED TO NOTICE SHARI'S CAR NEAR THE END OF THE DRIVEWAY. AND HE SEES HER PURSE ON THE PASSENGER SEAT AND OPENS IT TO SEE HER INSULIN THAT SHE NEEDS FOR DIABETES. SHE WOULD NEVER GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT THAT MEDICATION. SHARI! IT'S AS IF SHE LITERALLY HAS VANISHED INTO THIN AIR. SHARI! YOU LEFT THE POOL PARTY. WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT? THEN I -- I -- I WALKED HER TO HER CAR. THEN SHE DROVE AWAY? WAS SHE ANGRY WITH YOU? -I -- LISTEN -- LISTEN... -WERE YOU ANGRY WITH HER? I THINK YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME QUESTIONING ME WHEN YOU -- WHEN YOU -- WHEN YOU SHOULD BE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR HER. AUTHORITIES BEGAN TO ASK, "DO YOU THINK RICHARD COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO SHARI?" HE WAS THE LAST PERSON THAT HAD SEEN HER THAT DAY. IT WAS A CREEPY FEELING, WONDERING IF SOMEONE WE KNEW AND TRUSTED MIGHT BE INVOLVED, MIGHT AT LEAST KNOW MORE THAN THEY WERE LETTING ON. A SEARCH PARTY WAS ORGANIZED. AND THEY WENT LOOKING FOR SHARI. BUT THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. IT'S DARK. AND THAT IS EVEN MORE FRIGHTENING THAN DAYTIME BECAUSE HOW CAN THEY FIND HER? WHERE IS SHE? IS SHE OUT THERE BY HERSELF? DOES SOMEONE HAVE HER? WE HAVE NO ANSWERS. SHARI WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD. SHE WAS GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN TWO DAYS. SHE WAS SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AT THE GRADUATION CEREMONY. SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND THAT SHE WAS HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE WITH. EVERYTHING WAS WONDERFUL. EVERYTHING WAS EXCITING. AND IN AN INSTANT, ALL THAT COULD BE GONE. FRIENDS, LET US JOIN HEARTS AND HANDS. MY BROTHER, ROBERT, IS JUST 15, SO YOUNG TO BE FACING WHAT WAS UNFOLDING IN FRONT OF US. AND LET US ASK THE LORD TO PROTECT SHARI, WHEREVER SHE MAY BE. MY FATHER PRAYS, "GOD, WE DON'T KNOW WHERE SHARI IS. AND WE ARE AFRAID. AND WE JUST ASK THAT YOU BE WITH HER WHEREVER SHE IS BECAUSE WE CAN'T BE WITH HER." DAWN, WOULD YOU LEAD US IN SINGING "AMAZING GRACE"? ♪ AMAZING GRACE ♪ ♪ HOW SWEET THE SOUND ♪ ♪ THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME ♪ ♪ I ONCE WAS LOST ♪ WE ARE ABSOLUTELY HELPLESS, BUT WE'RE NOT HOPELESS. ♪ BUT NOW I'M FOUND ♪ ♪ WAS BLIND BUT NOW I SEE ♪ THAT NIGHT, THE FURTHEST THING FROM OUR MIND IS SLEEPING. HOW CAN YOU GO TO SLEEP WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHERE YOUR FAMILY IS, WHERE YOUR SISTER IS, WHERE YOUR CHILD IS? HELLO? Mrs. Smith. YES, THIS IS MRS. SMITH. She's wearing white shorts and a tank top. And I know her pa's not a fan of her new polka-dotted bikini. Shari told me so. EXCUSE ME, WHO IS THIS? IS THIS SOME SORT OF GAME? Ma'am, this is no hoax. I got Shari right here. WHO ARE YOU? WHO AM I SPEAKING WITH? WHO IS THIS?! WHERE IS SHE? IS SHE WITH YOU? PLEASE, LET ME SPEAK WITH SHARI. Don't worry, ma'am. Shari's written you all a letter. Be sure to check the mail. MY SISTER, SHARI... OH, MY GOD. ...IS MISSING. AND WE REALIZE SHE'S REALLY BEEN KIDNAPPED. THEY MANAGED TO TRACE THE CALL. IT'S FROM A PAY PHONE AT A CONVENIENCE STORE ABOUT 12 MILES AWAY. IT'S IN THE WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING. THERE'S NO SIGN OF ANYONE. THE MAN WHO CALLED TOLD US TO CHECK THE MAIL. IN THE MORNING, THE POLICE WENT TO THE POST OFFICE AND CAME BACK WITH A LETTER, SUPPOSEDLY FROM SHARI. MY DAD LOOKS LIKE THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD IS ON HIS SHOULDERS. AND I REMEMBER LOOKING AT HIS FACE AND THINKING, "HOW CAN SOMEBODY AGE 20 YEARS IN 2 DAYS?" "LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT." "I LOVE YOU, MOMMY, DADDY, ROBERT AND DAWN AND RICHARD AND ALL THE OTHER FRIENDS AND RELATIVES. PLEASE DON'T LET THIS RUIN YOUR LIVES." "SOME GOOD WILL COME OUT OF THIS. I LOVE YOU ALL SO DAMN MUCH." UNDERLINED DAMN. THE LETTER IS CLEARLY IN SHARI'S HANDWRITING. IT'S GOT SMILEY FACES IN THE CORNERS. AND EVEN IN WHAT SHE WRITES, SHE DOESN'T SEEM AFRAID. "EVERYTHING WORKS OUT FOR THOSE WHO LOVE THE LORD." SHE WROTE THIS LETTER ONLY YESTERDAY. AND THAT SAYS SHE'S ALIVE. WE CAN GET HER. POLICE IMMEDIATELY TAKE THE LETTER TO FORENSICS TO FIND ANY CLUES THEY CAN. BECAUSE SHARI HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED, THE FBI ENTER THE INVESTIGATION, LED BY DETECTIVE LYDIA GLOVER. SINCE RICHARD WAS THE LAST PERSON TO SEE SHARI, HE WAS STILL THE ONLY SUSPECT IN THE CASE. I JUST WANT TO TALK THROUGH WHAT HAPPENED THE DAY THAT SHARI WENT MISSING. HE'S WORRIED ABOUT HER. AND YET HE IS A SUSPECT. OF COURSE, I DIDN'T THINK SO. BUT THEN AGAIN, DO YOU REALLY KNOW? AND AFTER THE POOL, WHERE DID YOU GO? I ALREADY TOLD THEM, HOME. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. ALL RIGHT? IN THE END, THEY FOUND THAT HIS ALIBI WAS GOOD. AND HE WAS CLEARED AS A SUSPECT. I COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT SHARI. NEXT YEAR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THIS NEW CHAPTER OF LIFE TOGETHER AS COLLEGE STUDENTS AT THE SAME SCHOOL. ♪ THEY ARE WEAK BUT HE IS STRONG ♪ ♪ YES, JESUS LOVES ME ♪ SHARI AND I GREW UP SINGING TOGETHER. AND WE JUST SANG IN CHURCHES AND NURSING HOMES. ♪ YES, JESUS LOVES ME ♪ WE WERE GOING TO SING TOGETHER PROFESSIONALLY. AND NOW I WAS AFRAID THAT I WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN. THAT WAS UNTHINKABLE. ♪ THE BIBLE TELLS ME SO ♪ OFFICERS JUST ENCOURAGED US, "JUST TRY TO DO SOMETHING NORMAL." HOW EASY WAS THAT? SOMETHING WOULD BE FUNNY, AND WE WOULD LAUGH. AND THEN WE'D FEEL BAD FOR LAUGHING BECAUSE THAT SEEMED SO INAPPROPRIATE. OUR EMOTIONS WERE JUST RAW. AND WE WERE JUST WORN OUT EMOTIONALLY. HELLO? Hello, Dawn. Is that you? UH, YES. YES, IT'S DAWN. Did you come all the way down from Charlotte? HOW DO I KNOW YOU? You'll soon find out. But for now, get your mother on the phone. HELLO? You got Shari's letter, right? YES, WE DID. IS SHARI OKAY? SHE NEEDS HER MEDICINE. Don't worry. Shari's protected. And God looks after all of us. WHY CAN'T I SPEAK WITH SHARI? She asked me to communicate with you. LOOK, WE DON'T MEAN YOU ANY HARM. WE JUST WANT SHARI WELL AND ALL RIGHT. OKAY? Ma'am, please forgive me. This has just gone too far. Have an ambulance ready. Good night. THAT CALL IS TRACED. IT IS PLACED FROM A PAY PHONE AT A DIFFERENT CONVENIENCE STORE ABOUT 8 MILES FROM OUR HOME. SAME THING AGAIN. THEY DUST FOR FINGERPRINTS. THERE ARE NO CLUES LEFT IN THAT PHONE BOOTH. HE HAS DISAPPEARED. Hello, Dawn. Is that you? THIS TIME, THE CALL HAS BEEN RECORDED. UH, YES. YES, IT'S DAWN. Did you come all the way down from Charlotte? I FELT LIKE HE KNEW ME. HE KNEW MY NAME. HE KNEW I WAS LIVING IN CHARLOTTE. BUT IT'S CLEAR HE'S DOING SOMETHING TO ALTER HIS VOICE. DOES THIS VOICE SOUND FAMILIAR TO YOU AT ALL, AN ACQUAINTANCE, MAYBE EVEN SOMEBODY YOU'VE ONLY MET A FEW TIMES? DAWN, DO YOU RECOGNIZE IT? MY FATHER JUST KEEPS PUSHING ME. DAWN, YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS, DON'T YOU? LISTEN AGAIN. LISTEN AGAIN. I CAN'T. I DON'T KNOW. THIS MAN KNOWS WHO I AM. I HAVE TO REMEMBER HIM. MY SISTER'S LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. MY SISTER, SHARI, HAS BEEN MISSING FOR FOUR DAYS. AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A SUSPECT SINCE THE 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL DISAPPEARED LAST WEEK. IN ADDITION TO THE LEXINGTON AND SALUDA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS... AT THIS POINT, OUR FAMILY'S SITUATION, IT'S BECOME THE LEAD STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE STATE NEWSPAPER AND EVERY SINGLE NEWS BROADCAST ON EVERY CHANNEL. BUT THE FOCUS OF THEIR ATTENTION RIGHT NOW IS THE CALLER. Hello, Dawn. Is that you? UH, YES. YES, IT'S DAWN. Did you come all the way down from Charlotte? DETECTIVES WERE CONVINCED THAT THE CALLER, NOT ONLY KNEW US PERSONALLY, BUT WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN ME. WE THINK HE'S KEEN ON DAWN. IF SHE IS THE ONE TALKING TO HIM, SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DRAW HIM OUT, ASK HIM QUESTIONS, KEEP HIM TALKING LONG ENOUGH. ABSOLUTELY NOT. YOU -- YOU EITHER -- THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY THAN THAT. MR. SMITH, WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET SHARI BACK. DAWN'S OUR ONLY OPTION. IF SHE CAN KEEP HIM ON THE PHONE LONG ENOUGH, WE WILL CATCH HIM. IT'S OKAY, DAD. I'LL DO IT. I'LL TALK TO HIM. SHARI WAS ALWAYS THE FEARLESS ONE. IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER TO BE ON STAGE WITH HER THERE WITH ME. ♪ WHEN PEACE LIKE A RIVER ♪ ♪ ATTENDETH MY WAY ♪ ONCE, WE THOUGHT WE WERE BREAKING INTO THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. WE WERE ASKED TO SING AT CHURCH. ♪ WHATEVER MY LIFE... ♪ POSTERS WERE PUT UP ALL OVER THE TOWN OF LEXINGTON, "COME HEAR THE SMITH SISTERS SINGING GOSPEL FAVORITES AND OLDIE GOLDIES." AND SO WE THOUGHT WE WERE BIG TIME. AND, I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF 10 PEOPLE CAME. ♪ IT IS WELL WITH MY SOUL ♪ I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT DAY. IF THEY NEEDED ME TO BE BAIT FOR THE KIDNAPPER, THEN I HAD TO DO IT. AS HELPLESS AS I WAS, THIS WAS ONE THING THAT I COULD DO, WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO TO JUST GET SHARI BACK. HELLO? Dawn? YES. HELLO? This is Shari's request. Get your mother on the other phone, quickly. GET ON THE OTHER PHONE. Say nothing unless you're asked. Now write this down. At 3:28 in the afternoon, Friday, 31st of May, SHARI FAYE WAS KIDNAPPED FROM YOUR MAILBOX. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE GOING TOO FAST. AT 3:28 IN THE AFTERNOON... I know these calls are being taped and traced. Correct? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. IS SHARI WITH YOU? Just write this down. I don't have much time. AS HE'S TALKING, THE CALL IS ALREADY TRACED. 4:59 a.m. Saturday, the 1st of June, became one soul. "BECAME ONE SOUL," WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? No questions now. IT'S ABOUT 9 MILES AWAY, A CONVENIENCE STORE. MOM AND I ARE TRYING AS HARD AS WE CAN TO KEEP HIM ON THE PHONE, TO KEEP HIM TALKING. Between 4:00 and 7:00 tomorrow, have an ambulance ready, no circus. OKAY, BUT YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN. NO CIRCUS? PLEASE DON'T KILL MY DAUGHTER. WHY DOESN'T SHARI TALK TO US? She asked me to speak with you. Weren't you aware of that? WE LOVE AND MISS YOU ALL. Get good rest tonight. Goodbye. ONCE AGAIN, HE IS GONE, NO SIGN OF ANYONE, NO CLUES, NO FINGERPRINTS. THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WHO IN THE WORLD THIS MAN COULD BE. WHERE COULD THIS MAN BE? IT'S FIVE DAYS SINCE SHARI WAS TAKEN. HE TOLD US TO HAVE AN AMBULANCE READY. AND THAT MEANS SHE'S STILL ALIVE. IF WE CAN GET HER MEDICINE TO HER, SHE HAS A CHANCE. WE WERE VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE WERE ABOUT TO GET HER BACK. HELLO? Hello, Dawn. Listen carefully. Write this down. At Mason Lodge number 103, go about 100 yards behind it and head to a small clearing in the woods. Shari and I are waiting. LET'S GO. HE HAS SAID, "WE ARE WAITING." AND THAT SAYS TO US HE IS FINALLY TURNING HIMSELF IN, AND HE IS FINALLY GONNA GIVE SHARI BACK. CAPTAIN GASQUE SAYS TO MY FAMILY THAT IT WOULD JUST BE BEST FOR US TO WAIT. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE AN ETERNITY. AND THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY. WE JUST LITERALLY SIT THERE, STARING AT THE WALL, WAITING. CAPTAIN GASQUE AND THE OTHER OFFICERS, THEY FOLLOWED THOSE DIRECTIONS. THE MAN SAID THEY WOULD BE WAITING. WE HEARD THE PATROL CAR COMING BACK DOWN THE DRIVEWAY. NO, NO. I'M SORRY. THAT'S WHEN WE KNEW SHE WAS DEAD. SHARI! AND AT THAT MOMENT, MY MOM JUST FALLS APART, JUST SOBBING, JUST, "NOT MY SHARI." WE KNEW THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE. BUT NOW IT WAS REAL. AND I'D NEVER HEARD CRYING LIKE THAT UNTIL THAT MOMENT. INSTEAD OF THEM WAITING, WHAT THEY FOUND WAS SHARI'S VERY BADLY DECOMPOSED BODY. AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE HAD BEEN DEAD FOR DAYS. ALL THAT TIME, THROUGH ALL OF THOSE PHONE CALLS, SHE WAS LAYING OUT THERE IN THE WOODS, DEAD. NO. WHY? WHY DID THIS MAN DO THIS? HOW IN THE WORLD WOULD WE EVER MAKE IT PAST THAT MOMENT IN LIFE AGAIN? WE ARE HERE TO CELEBRATE A LIFE OF ONE OF OUR OWN, ONE OF OUR FAMILY. SHARI'S BEEN A PART OF OUR CONGREGATION EVER SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE BABY. THE DAY OF SHARI'S FUNERAL, EVEN AFTER ALL OF THE PHONE CALLS, AFTER ALL OF THE PHONE RECORDINGS, WE HAVE SHARI'S BODY, AND WE STILL HAVE NO CLUE. AND HE'S STILL OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. ONE THING I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER ABOUT HER IS HER INFECTIOUS SMILE. IS HE HERE? IS HE HERE, ENJOYING WATCHING OUR FAMILY SUFFER AND GRIEVE? WE COULDN'T EVEN REALLY GRIEVE OVER OUR LOSS BECAUSE HE WAS STILL OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. FRIENDS, WE ARE HERE TODAY NOT TO MOURN A DEATH BUT TO CELEBRATE A... I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY! EVERYONE BEGINS TO PANIC. EVERYONE BEGINS TO RUN AND LOOK. AND WHAT DO WE DO? AND COULD THIS BE HIM? I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I KNOW WHO HE IS. OH, MY GOODNESS, IT CAN'T BE HIM. I'M SORRY! JUST AFTER THE FUNERAL FOR MY SISTER, SHARI, IT LOOKS LIKE THE KILLER HAS GIVEN HIMSELF UP. IT WAS A MAN FROM OUR CHURCH, NOT SOMEONE WE KNEW WELL BUT SOMEONE WE HAD TALKED TO AND PRAYED WITH. OH, MY GOSH. IT'S SOMEBODY THAT WE KNOW THAT'S DONE THIS TO OUR FAMILY. HELLO? Hello, Dawn. I'M THINKING, "HOW COULD HE BE CALLING? THE POLICE HAVE HIM." Dawn, like the break of day, dawn. IT WAS HIM, THE LAST PERSON I WANTED TO HEAR FROM EVER AGAIN. UH-HUH, SURE, LIKE THE BREAK OF DAY. Shari told me I should turn myself over to God. The truth is I really never meant to hurt no one. All I ever wanted to do was make love to Dawn. TO WHO? I can tell her casket was closed. Did you honor her request and fold her hands? DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE PUT US THROUGH? DAWN. IN THAT INSTANT, I REALIZED, IF I DON'T DO A GOOD JOB AND KEEP HIM ON THE PHONE, WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US? AND SO I REALLY HAVE TO REIGN IN MY EMOTIONS AT THAT POINT 'CAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK AND WHAT I FEEL. WHAT MATTERS IS CATCHING THIS CRAZY PERSON THAT IS OUT THERE. WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY SISTER? Oh, I'm not sure you're in the right state of mind to handle hearing it. Are you? YES, GO ON. I tied her to the bed post with electrical cord. She didn't struggle or cry or anything. I gave her three choices -- drug overdose, gunshot or suffocation. Shari picked suffocation. So I took duct tape and wrapped it all the way around her head. And I suffocated her. THERE IS NO WAY IN THIS WORLD SHE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THAT. BUT THAT'S WHAT HE TELLS ME SHE CHOSE. God only knows why this happened. It's what Shari chose. She was gonna be an angel. I WAS JUST BEYOND SICK OF THE WHOLE THING. AND NOT LONG AFTER THAT, WE GOT MORE NEWS FROM THE POLICE. I AM SORRY FOR THIS TRAGEDY, BUT I FORGIVE YOU. IT TURNS OUT THAT THE GENTLEMAN AT THE SERVICE, HE WAS SO HEARTBROKEN FOR US, THAT HE WAS BEGGING THE MURDERER TO TURN HIMSELF IN. I DIDN'T FEEL SAFE LEAVING THE HOUSE, KNOWING HE WAS STILL OUT THERE. BUT A WEEK HAD PASSED, AND HE DIDN'T CALL. I'M BEATING MYSELF UP FOR LOSING MY PATIENCE WITH HIM AND THINKING IT'S MY FAULT THAT HE'S NOT CALLED. THEN HE DID IT AGAIN. IT IS EXACTLY TWO WEEKS WITHIN THE HOUR OF SHARI'S KIDNAPPING. WE HEAR OF THIS LITTLE GIRL IN RICHLAND COUNTY. AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT SHARI'S CASE AND THIS LITTLE GIRL ARE RELATED. ON JUNE 14th, 2 WEEKS TO THE HOUR AFTER SHARI SMITH WAS KIDNAPPED, ANOTHER GIRL WAS ABDUCTED, THIS TIME FROM A TRAILER PARK IN RICHLAND COUNTY. 10-YEAR-OLD DEBBY HELMICK WAS PLAYING IN HER YARD WHEN A MAN DROVE UP, THREW HER IN HIS CAR AND DROVE OFF. ABSOLUTE TERROR IS JUST REIGNING IN OUR STATE. CHILDREN DIDN'T GO OUT ON THE PLAYGROUNDS. PARENTS DIDN'T LET THEIR CHILDREN GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY. AND EVERYONE IS AFRAID. NO ONE FELT SAFE. I WORRY ABOUT THAT LITTLE GIRL. MAYBE IF I HADN'T HUNG UP ON HIM, THEY WOULD HAVE CAUGHT HIM, AND SHE'D BE OKAY. AND THEN, TWO WEEKS SINCE HE HAS CALLED... ...OUR PHONE RINGS AGAIN. HELLO? AND IT'S HIM. Dawn, your time is near. God wants you to join Shari. It's only a matter of time. You can't be protected always. IN THIS PHONE CALL, HE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THE SAME MAN. HE'S NO LONGER DISGUISING HIS VOICE. Whether it's this month or next year, I will get you, too. Have you heard of Debra May in Richland County? HE SEEMS ALMOST CONFIDENT, COCKY. HE'S ENJOYING IT. AND HE'S PROUD OF HIMSELF. ALL OF THAT SCARES ME TO DEATH. Turn right, last dirt road when you come to a stop sign. HE SEEMS TO BE READING DIRECTIONS JUST LIKE HE DID WHEN HE READ DIRECTIONS TO SHARI'S BODY. Debra May is waiting. God forgive us and protect us all. THEY FOUND DEBRA MAY'S BODY. AND SHE HAD BEEN DEAD FOR DAYS AS WELL. I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER, "IS HE WATCHING ME?" WHERE IS HE THAT HE CAN KNOW ANY DETAILS ABOUT MY LIFE? WHO'S GONNA PROTECT ME? WHO'S GONNA KEEP ME FROM HIM GETTING ME JUST LIKE HE GOT SHARI, JUST LIKE HE'S TAKEN DEBRA? AND THEN OUT OF NOWHERE, THERE WAS A RAY OF HOPE. SHARI'S LETTER WAS AT THE FORENSIC LAB. THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND ALMOST INDENTATIONS OF NUMBERS AND WORDS AND LETTERS. IT SEEMED TO BE A PHONE NUMBER. ONE DIGIT WAS MISSING. THEY TRIED EVERY SINGLE DIGIT POSSIBLE, WHICH LED TO AN OUT-OF-STATE PHONE NUMBER THAT WAS LINKED TO AN ADDRESS RIGHT HERE IN LEXINGTON, SOUTH CAROLINA. AND THAT ADDRESS BELONGED TO ELLIS AND SHARON SHEPPARD. THEIR REGULAR HOUSE SITTER IS A MAN BY THE NAME OF LARRY BELL. AND HE IS AN ELECTRICIAN WHO WORKS WITH MR. SHEPPARD OFF AND ON. THE SHEPPARDS TELL INVESTIGATORS THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY HOUSE-SITTING FOR THEM BOTH TIMES WHEN THE GIRLS WENT MISSING. DO YOU MIND IF WE TAKE A LOOK AROUND? NO, NOT AT ALL. THEY IMMEDIATELY FIND THE TABLET BY THE PHONE THAT IS THE EXACT ONE SHARI'S LETTER WAS WRITTEN ON. THAT MEANS SHARI WAS IN THIS HOUSE. THEY FIND HAIR AND OTHER FIBERS THAT LINK BOTH SHARI AND DEBRA TO THE SHEPPARDS' HOME. THIS WAS THE MAN WHO TOOK BOTH SHARI AND DEBRA AND USED THE SHEPPARDS' HOME TO CARRY OUT THE CRIMES. THIS MAN WAS STILL OUT THERE. IS HE GONNA DO IT AGAIN? IS HE COMING FOR ME? POLICE MOVE TO ARREST LARRY BELL AND SET UP ROAD BLOCKS AROUND HIS HOUSE. STEP OUT OF THE CAR, PLEASE. WHEN POLICE START LOOKING INTO LARRY BELL'S BACKGROUND, THEY FIND THAT HE HAS A CRIMINAL RECORD OF ATTEMPTED ABDUCTIONS OF OTHER WOMEN. FINALLY, THANK GOD, THIS IS HIM. THEY HAVE CAUGHT HIM, BUT IT WASN'T OVER. HE HASN'T ADMITTED ANYTHING. WE NEED YOU TO IDENTIFY THE VOICE. AND WE'D LIKE YOU TO DO IT FACE-TO-FACE SO YOU CAN GET HIM TO REACT, MAYBE EVEN CONFESS. WHY DON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING, LARRY? THANK Y'ALL FOR COMING. AS HE BEGAN TO SPEAK, MOM AND I BOTH REALIZED, "OH, MY GOSH, THIS IS THE MAN THAT WE SPOKE TO ON THE PHONE." I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR FAMILY. YOU'RE THE PERSON WE TALKED TO ON THE PHONE. YOU TOOK HER. I KNOW YOU KILLED MY DAUGHTER, BUT I DON'T HATE YOU. I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM IN MY HEART FOR ANY MORE PAIN. OTHER THAN THE VOICE ON THE PHONE, HE WAS A COMPLETE STRANGER. WE'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE. WE DON'T THINK SHARI KNEW HIM. EVERYTHING HE KNEW ABOUT ME HE PROBABLY GOT FROM SHARI. WELL, LOOKS LIKE SHARI'S HOME. OH, GOOD. SHARI HAD JUST ARRIVED HOME FROM THE POOL PARTY AND HAD STOPPED AT THE END OF THE DRIVEWAY TO GET THE MAIL. LARRY GENE BELL SAW HER... ...AND GRABBED HER. IT ONLY TOOK A MATTER OF SECONDS. AND SHE WAS GONE. I WONDER WHAT'S TAKING HER SO LONG. LARRY BELL IS FOUND GUILTY OF KIDNAPPING AND MURDERING BOTH SHARI AND DEBRA. HE IS SENTENCED TO TWO DEATH SENTENCES. AND HE IS EXECUTED. I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN WITH LIFE AGAIN. AND I WOULD THINK BACK TO SHARI'S LETTER AND READ IT OVER AND OVER IN MY MIND WHERE SHE WOULD SAY, "DON'T LET THIS RUIN YOUR LIVES." DO I LET THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHAT HAPPENED RUIN THE REST OF MY LIFE? OR DO I TAKE HOLD OF THEM AND SAY, "OKAY, WHAT CAN I DO WITH THIS?" I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL. AND MY VOICE TEACHER SAID, "HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED ENTERING THE MISS SOUTH CAROLINA PAGEANT?" SO I ENTERED. AND LO AND BEHOLD, I WON THE THING. DAWN ELIZABETH SMITH! THE VERY FIRST PLACE I WAS ASKED TO COME AS MISS SOUTH CAROLINA WAS A SMALL LITTLE CHURCH THAT SAID, "WOULD YOU COME AND TELL YOUR STORY AT OUR CHURCH?" AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS IS -- IS SHARING A STORY OF FAITH. ♪ BECAUSE THE BIBLE TELLS ME SO ♪ I KNOW THAT SHARI IS WATCHING. YOU HAD TO BE AFRAID. AND YET YOU WERE JUST WORRIED ABOUT US. AND SO I'M PROUD OF YOU AS MY LITTLE SISTER. SHARI'S LETTER, FOR ME, IS A TRIBUTE TO HER COURAGE. "PLEASE DON'T EVEN LET THIS RUIN YOUR LIVES. SOME GOOD WILL COME OUT OF THIS. PLEASE DO NOT BECOME HARD OR UPSET. EVERYTHING WORKS OUT FOR THE GOOD. ALL MY LOVE ALWAYS, SHARI SMITH." IN HER FINAL MOMENTS, SHE DIDN'T CHOOSE FEAR. SHE CHOSE FAITH AND COURAGE. LOSING SHARI MADE ME REALIZE EVERY DAY THAT I HAVE IS A GIFT GOD'S GIVEN ME. AND I HAVE A DECISION -- WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH IT? AND I'M GONNA CHOOSE FAITH.
