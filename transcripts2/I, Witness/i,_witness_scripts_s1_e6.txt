 I THINK FOR ANYONE WHO'S BORN IN A WAR ZONE, IT'S A HORRIBLE MEMORY. BUT FOR SOME, THEY ARE NEVER ABLE TO SILENCE THE ECHOES. AND IT ONLY TAKES A SINGLE SPARK TO REIGNITE THE FLAMES OF THEIR PAST.

 MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE THREE ADOPTED CHILDREN. BUT ANDY WAS ALWAYS THE ONE WE WORRIED THE MOST ABOUT. HE WAS ORPHANED DURING THE VIETNAM WAR, AND HIS EXPERIENCES THERE LEFT HIM DEEPLY SCARED. OH, YOU LOOK SO GROWN-UP. I'M 26. ALL RIGHT? I'VE BEEN GROWN UP FOR A WHILE. OH, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS SOMEDAY. I LOVE YOU. LOVE YOU. DRIVE SAFE. BUT WE HAD NO IDEA AS HE LEFT THAT CHRISTMAS HOW MUCH DANGER HE WAS REALLY IN. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY HEART'S DESIRE

 TO ADOPT CHILDREN WHO WERE IN NEED OF A HOME, A PLACE TO LIVE, AND A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WOULD LOVE THEM. IN 1975, SAIGON WAS FALLING, AND IT WAS DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME THAT ANDY CAME. AT THIS HOUR, A NUMBER OF CHARTERED JETS ARE IN THE AIR OVER THE PACIFIC, BRINGING SOME 900 ORPHANS OF THE VIETNAM WAR TO THE UNITED STATES. A 747 PAN AM JET HAD BEEN CHARTERED TO TAKE 405 MORE CHILDREN AND THEIR DOCTORS, NURSES, AND ESCORTS TO THE UNITED STATES. ALL OF THE CHILDREN LEAVING HERE TODAY HAVE BEEN FORMALLY ADOPTED BY AMERICAN FAMILIES. IT WAS CALLED OPERATION BABYLIFT. AND ABOUT 3,000 CHILDREN FROM VIETNAM WERE BROUGHT INTO THE U.S. AT THAT TIME. AND HE HAD BEEN THROUGH A LONG ORDEAL. HE WAS ABANDONED THERE AT THE GOOD SHEPHERD ORPHANAGE IN SAIGON. THERE WAS BOMBING GOING ON, STRAFING. THE LIGHTS WOULD GO OUT. THE POWER WOULD GO OUT. AND THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH ADULTS THERE TO HOLD THESE BABIES WHEN THESE SCARY THINGS HAPPENED. JANUARY 7, 2001, WAS A SUNDAY. MY HUSBAND AND I WERE HOME TOGETHER. HELLO? Hi, I'm calling from the Butte County sheriff's department. I ANSWERED THE PHONE, AND THERE IS A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY ON THE PHONE. Andy failed to report to his court-ordered community service, so we're trying to track him down. HE DIDN'T GO? I'm afraid not, Mrs. Bushard. ANDY HAD BEEN SENTENCED TO COMMUNITY SERVICE WHEN HE BOUGHT TWO PARROTS THAT TURNED OUT TO BE STOLEN. WANT A TREAT? IT WAS UPSETTING, AS A PARENT, TO HAVE HIM IN LEGAL TROUBLE, BUT I KNEW IT CAME FROM THE BEST PART OF ANDY. BECAUSE OF HIS TRAUMATIC CHILDHOOD, HE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME REALLY CONNECTING WITH OTHER PEOPLE. BUT HE LOVED ANIMALS, ESPECIALLY HIS DOGS. HIS DOGS WERE HIS BEST FRIENDS. GOOD BOY, GOOD BOY. Is he home? May I speak with him? WELL, ANDY DOESN'T LIVE HERE WITH US. HE HAS A NEW PLACE OVER IN COHASSET. AND I SAID, "WELL, HE LIVES IN COHASSET, AND AS FAR AS I KNOW, THAT'S WHERE HE IS." FIVE WEEKS EARLIER, HE HAD RENTED A ROOM IN A THREE-BEDROOM HOUSE THERE. HEY, MAN. YOU CAN'T BLOCK THE DOOR LIKE THIS. SORRY, I -- THEY'LL BE GONE IN A SECOND. DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM. ALL RIGHT. YOU SEE THAT CLUMP OF TREES OVER THERE? YOU MENTIONED TAKING YOUR DOGS FOR A HIKE. WELL, THERE'S A TRAILHEAD STARTS RIGHT ABOUT THERE. HE LOVED LIVING THERE BECAUSE IT'S IN A FORESTED AREA, AND ANDY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN OUTDOOR PERSON. I BELIEVE THAT HE FOUND PEACE THERE. WHAT WAS THAT? THAT WAS SOMEONE FROM THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE. ANDY HAD COMMUNITY SERVICE, AND HE DIDN'T SHOW UP. I'M SURE HE'S FINE. I'M GONNA CALL HIM. HI, ANDY. IT'S MOM. YOU CAN'T JUST NOT SHOW UP FOR THESE THINGS, HON. LOVE YOU. ON JANUARY 8th, THE NEXT DAY... ...WE GOT A CALL FROM DEPUTY OLIVE... HELLO? ...WITH THE BUTTE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. YES. AND HE WAS INQUIRING ABOUT ANDY ALSO. THAT IS WHEN ALL THE RED FLAGS WENT UP. TWO CALLS TWO DAYS IN A ROW WAS NOT NORMAL. NO, WE HAVEN'T. UM, WHAT'S GOING ON? AND HE WANTED TO KNOW SPECIFICALLY IF WE HAD SEEN ANDY RECENTLY, AND I TOLD HIM THE LAST TIME WE HAD SEEN HIM WAS THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS, TWO WEEKS BEFORE. OPEN. LOVE. HEART. HEART, HEART. CHRISTMAS AT OUR HOUSE IS -- IS A BIG EVENT. ANDY WAS HAPPY, AND HE HAD GIFTS FOR HIS SIBLINGS. HE HAD GIFTS FOR PAUL AND I. AS THE MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN BY BIRTH AND THREE BY ADOPTION, I NEVER DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN MY CHILDREN AS FAR AS, UM...ANYTHING. I WOULD FORGET AT TIMES THAT I DIDN'T GIVE BIRTH TO ANDY OR HIS ADOPTED SIBLINGS. OH, MY GOODNESS! OH, MY GOD! WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP, IF SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT I FELT WAS RACIAL, I WOULD ALWAYS WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. I TOLD THE SHERIFF'S DEPUTY THAT ON DECEMBER 26th, WHEN ANDY LEFT, HE WENT OUT THE BACK DOOR. I HUGGED HIM AS USUAL. MERRY CHRISTMAS! HE ALREADY HAD THE DOGS LOADED UP IN HIS JEEP. DEPUTY OLIVE SAYS, "OH, WE -- WE JUST HAD HAD A REPORT, AND WE WERE JUST WONDERING IF YOU KNEW WHERE HE IS." I TOLD HIM THAT WE HAD JUST TALKED TO A DEPUTY THE DAY BEFORE AND THAT WE WEREN'T REAL SURE WHERE HE WAS. YES, THANK YOU, OFFICER. UH, WE'LL LET YOU KNOW IF WE HEAR FROM HIM AT ALL. I'M THINKING... "WHAT IS GOING ON, ANDY?" ANDY, IT'S MOM. OF COURSE, I CALLED HIM RIGHT AWAY. YOU HAVE US WORRIED. YOU NEED TO CALL US. LET US KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. I LOVE YOU. ANDY'S BIRTHDAY WAS JANUARY 10th, TWO DAYS LATER. WE HAD WRAPPED GIFTS. WE HAD A BIRTHDAY CARD FOR HIM. WE WERE ALL READY FOR HIS BIRTHDAY. ANDY HADN'T CALLED ME BACK. I WAS STARTING TO...GET SCARED. WE WERE CERTAINLY HOPING THAT WHEN HE CAME FOR HIS BIRTHDAY, THAT WE WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO PUT THINGS TOGETHER, FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. HE KNEW HE'D BE GETTING PRESENTS, SO WHY WOULDN'T HE COME? WHY WOULDN'T HE GET IN TOUCH WITH MOM AND DAD? THIS ISN'T LIKE HIM. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. THIS ISN'T HIM. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. JANUARY 10th COMES AND GOES. HE DIDN'T COME, DIDN'T EVER HEAR BACK FROM HIM. OUR CONCERN BECOMES A LOT MORE INTENSE. SOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG. SHORTLY AFTER THAT, PAUL CALLS THE HOUSE THAT ANDY WAS LIVING IN IN COHASSET. HELLO? THIS IS PAUL, ANDY BUSHARD'S FATHER. UH, WHO'S THIS? THIS IS JIM. Hi, Jim. UM, WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANDY, AND WE'RE A BIT CONCERNED. UH, HAVE YOU SEEN HIM OR HEARD FROM HIM AT ALL? UH, NO. I -- I HAVEN'T, MAN, BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY I WOULD. You live with him, don't you? NOT ANYMORE. What do you mean not anymore? HE'S GONE, MAN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN GONE? LIKE, HE SKIPPED TOWN. ALL OF HIS STUFF'S GONE. I WAS AWAY FOR THE HOLIDAYS. I CAME BACK. HIS ROOM WAS TOTALLY EMPTY, LIKE HE WAS NEVER EVEN HERE. THAT WAS TERRIFYING BECAUSE IT MEANT THAT ANDY HAD BEEN MISSING MUCH LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT. WELL, IF YOU HEAR FROM HIM, WILL YOU JUST... T-TELL HIM TO GET IN TOUCH, PLEASE. Yeah. Fine. THANKS. WHAT HAPPENED? THE ALARMS ARE GOING OFF BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T JUST TAKE OFF. WE WENT TO THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE TO TALK TO DEPUTY OLIVE. DEPUTY OLIVE. PAUL BUSHARD. AND WE SAID THAT, "OUR SON HAS BEEN MISSING FOR QUITE A WHILE." HAVEN'T SEEN OUR SON ANDY SINCE CHRISTMAS. WE SAY THAT, "THIS IS NOT LIKE OUR SON. WE'RE HIS PARENTS. WE KNOW HIM." HIS HOUSEMATE SAYS THAT... AND WE FELT LIKE WE NEEDED THE HELP OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WELL, UM, THE THING IS -- IS, UH, ANDY'S YOUNG. HE'S...26, RIGHT? YES. AND AS YOU KNOW, HE'S ON THE RADAR FOR SOME LEGAL PROBLEMS. WE SEE THIS THING QUITE A LOT. KIDS ARE USUALLY WHERE THEY WANT TO BE, UM, YOU KNOW, AND WHEN THEY WANT TO GET IN TOUCH WITH MOM AND DAD, UM, THEY'LL LET YOU KNOW. HE FELT THAT ANDY HAD INTENTIONALLY DISAPPEARED. IF SOMETHING DOES COME UP, WE'LL DEFINITELY GET BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU. WE WERE SO SHOCKED BY THE DEPUTY'S ATTITUDE. WE JUST COULDN'T GET HIM TO TAKE US SERIOUSLY. WHEN WE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT, WE STARTED WHAT WE CALL THE TIMELINE. WE STARTED TAKING NOTES. SO THE LAST TIME YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN ANDY WAS... WE NEEDED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE ANDY WAS, AND WE THOUGHT THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WAS TO MAP OUT EVERYWHERE HE'D BEEN BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED. NONE OF OUR OTHER CHILDREN, ANDY'S SIBLINGS, HAD SEEN ANDY OR HEARD FROM HIM, EITHER. HELLO. THIS IS HIM. WE STARTED CALLING HIS FRIENDS, AND NOBODY HAD SEEN HIM. AND AFTER THAT, WE TRIED HIS WORK. THANK YOU. HEY, YOU LIKE DOGS? HERE YOU GO. I HAVE TWO DOGS, TOO. TAKE CARE OF THIS GUY. ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. HOW WE DOIN' HERE, GUYS? GOOD. ANDY HAD BEEN VOLUNTEERING AT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LEGAL SERVICES, AND HE WORKED WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING DISPUTES WITH THEIR LANDLORDS AND WHO ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY MAINTAINING THEIR RESIDENCE. OKAY, SO THIS ONE SECTION OVER HERE, UH... HE HAD A CASELOAD OF HIS OWN THAT HE WORKED. HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING? GOOD? YOU GUYS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS? NO? I PROMISE, YOU GUYS HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. YOU'RE IN GREAT HANDS WITH ANDY. YEAH. ANDY LOVED HIS JOB, AND HE CARED A LOT ABOUT HIS CLIENTS. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET BACK TO THIS SECTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CALL. THAT WAS SUE FROM LEGAL AID. AND THEN, THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE HIKING ONE DAY UP IN BUTTE CREEK CANYON WHO SAW TWO DOGS WHO WERE THIN AND MALNOURISHED-LOOKING, ROAMING, JUST WANDERING IN THE AREA, AND IT TURNS OUT IT WAS ANDY'S TWO DOGS. THIS IS JUST PROOF TO US THAT SOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG. HE WOULD BE WITH HIS DOGS. HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW THEM... TO WANDER LIKE THIS. SO WHERE IS HE? ...TRAILHEAD STARTS RIGHT ABOUT THERE. SHOULD WE BE GETTING PEOPLE OUT THERE TO LOOK FOR HIM? WE GO BACK TO THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND EXPLAIN WHAT WE'D LEARNED ABOUT THE DOGS. WE'RE MORE INSISTENT THIS TIME BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE THE CLOCK IS TICKING. AT THIS POINT, WE ARE DESPERATE. WE ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR SON'S WELL-BEING. WE'D LIKE TO FILE A MISSING PERSONS REPORT FOR OUR SON. AND WE WANT TO KNOW WHERE HE IS. UH, A MISSING PERSONS REPORT WAS ALREADY FILED, UM, JANUARY 7th. W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S ALREADY BEEN FILED? WHO -- WHO FILED IT? HOW DID THEY KNOW THAT ANDY WAS MISSING? LOOK IT'S, UM, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. HOW IN THE WORLD WERE WE NOT TOLD ABOUT THIS?! HE HAD KNOWN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THAT A MISSING-PERSON'S REPORT HAD BEEN FILED, AND WE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THAT. I WAS SO ANGRY AND UPSET. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE HAD DONE THAT. UH, YOUR -- YOUR SON... DEPUTY OLIVE TELLS US THAT THE MAN THAT FILED THE REPORT IS HERBERT HOOVER COPE SR. HERB COPE? YEAH. HERB COPE. HERB COPE SR. I THINK I'M GOING OUT OF MY MIND. I -- I'M -- I'VE GOT TO GET SOMETHING OFF MY CHEST. OKAY, SIR. WHAT'S GOING ON? I WANT TO REPORT A MURDER. DEPUTY OLIVE TELLS US THAT THE MAN THAT FILED THE REPORT IS HERBERT HOOVER COPE SR. BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHO HERB COPE IS. WE'VE BEEN GETTING A CALL ONCE A MONTH FROM HIM, AND IT NEVER AMOUNTS TO ANYTHING. HE WAS KNOWN TO BE A FREQUENT CALLER TO THE BUTTE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE WITH WILD STORIES AND, YOU KNOW, THINGS THAT WERE NOT...RELIABLE WHEN THEY WENT AND CHECKED THEM OUT. I WANT TO REPORT A MURDER. UH, OKAY, MR. COPE. IS THERE A BODY? CAN YOU TELL US WHERE A BODY IS LOCATED? WELL, IT'S NOT -- NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE A BODY IS. NO, I DON'T. DID YOU SEE SOMETHING BAD HAPPEN? WELL, NO, BUT -- HOW DO YOU KNOW THERE WAS A MURDER, THEN, SIR? BECAUSE OF WHAT HE HAD ME DO. ACCORDING TO MR. COPE, ANDY'S LANDLORD CALLED HIM AND SAID, "I NEED YOU TO TAKE ANDY'S BELONGINGS AND GET RID OF 'EM. GET 'EM OFF THE PROPERTY." AND, UM, MR. COPE DID HAVE A TRUCKLOAD OF STUFF AT HIS HOUSE. SO HERB COPE TOLD THE SHERIFF'S DEPUTY THAT HE HAD A TRUCKLOAD OF ANDY'S BELONGINGS, AND THEY GO THROUGH THE STUFF IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. AND OUR SON'S NAME IS ON SOME OF THE MAIL. SIR, THE-THESE ARE NOT, UH, PROOF OF A MURDER, SIR. WELL, WHAT ABOUT A MISSING-PERSON'S REPORT? YOU WANT TO FILE A MISSING-PERSON'S REPORT WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THEIR BELONGINGS RIGHT HERE? IT MIGHT NOT LOOK TOO GOOD, SIR. I WANT TO FILE A MISSING-PERSON'S REPORT. I HAVE TO. DEPUTY OLIVE'S TAKE ON HERBERT COPE SR. IS THAT HE IS OLD AND HE'S KIND OF SENILE. OKAY, MR. COPE. WHAT SHOULD WE PUT DOWN IN THE REPORT? UM, AND IN ADDITION, UM, TO THE MISSING-PERSONS REPORT, THERE WAS ALSO AN ARREST WARRANT, UM, OUT -- OUT FOR, UM, ANDY MISSING COMMUNITY SERVICE, AND THAT'S WHEN I CALLED YOU. AND I ALSO FOLLOWED UP ON HERB COPE'S STORY. DEPUTY OLIVE TOLD ME THAT HE WENT TO THE HOUSE THAT ANDY WAS LIVING IN IN COHASSET. SAM PARRIS. YEAH. I'M, UH, DEPUTY OLIVE. THE LANDLORD, SAM PARRIS, ACTUALLY HAD OWNED A RESTAURANT IN CHICO, A LITTLE CAFE. HE WAS A KNOWN MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY. UM, I UNDERSTAND, A YOUNG MAN LIVED HERE NAMED, UH, ANDY BUSHARD. UH, YEAH. HE WASN'T HERE LONG. A FEW MONTHS MAYBE. ALL RIGHT. WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM? CAME BACK AFTER CHRISTMAS AND HE WAS GONE. HMM, MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK AROUND? UH, NO, SURE. COME ON IN. REALLY STRANGE, HIM CLEARING OUT LIKE THAT. WELL, I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME, MR. PARRIS. YEAH, MY PLEASURE. LET ME KNOW IF I CAN HELP IN ANY WAY. SO WE FOLLOWED UP ON WHAT HERB COPE HAD TOLD US. IS THERE ANY WAY THAT WE COULD CONTACT HIM OURSELVES? HE'S A CRANK CALLER. HE'S A DEMENTED OLD MAN. MAYBE HE ACTUALLY KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ANDY. PLEASE. CLEARLY, THE POLICE BELIEVED THAT ANDY HAD SKIPPED TOWN. SO IT MADE SENSE THAT THE LANDLORD HAD ASKED SOMEONE TO CLEAR OUT HIS THINGS. IT DIDN'T APPEAR TO US THAT MUCH OF ANYTHING WAS BEING DONE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT, SO WE DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO STEP IN AND DO SOMETHING. AT THIS POINT, WE ARE LOOKING FOR ANYTHING THAT WILL HELP US FIND OUR SON. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE PLACE. IT'S, UH, I JUST DON'T GET TOO MANY VISITORS HERE. UH, CLEAR THESE CHAIRS OFF. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT HERB COPE SR. IS LIKE. I GOT THIS CLOCK HERE. LOOK -- LOOK AT THAT CLOCK. NEIGHBOR SAID IT WAS COMPLETELY BUSTED, BUT, UH, SOMETIMES, ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS TAKE IT APART AND SEE HOW THE PIECES FIT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO HIM AND SEE IF HE APPEARS RELIABLE. MR. COPE... THE POLICE SAID YOU HAD A PICKUP ON YOUR DRIVEWAY WITH OUR SON'S BELONGINGS. WELL, I TRIED TO TELL THE COPS ABOUT IT, BUT THEY WOULDN'T LISTEN. COULD YOU TELL US WHAT YOU TOLD THEM? SURE. AND AS IT TURNS OUT, HE'S VERY COOPERATIVE... AND HE'S INTERESTED IN HELPING US. AND ALSO, HERB COPE IS SAM PARRIS' UNCLE. SAM PARRIS IS ANDY'S LANDLORD. WHAT ARE WE DOING THIS FOR? JUST SHUT UP. WHAT? MR. COPE TOLD US THE STORY THAT SAM PARRIS TOLD HIM WHEN HE WAS LOADING UP THE CAR. SLOW DOWN! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?! SHUT UP. JUST SHUT UP! I NEED IT OFF THE PROPERTY. I NEED IT ALL GONE. WH-WH-WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE IT, AND WHO DOES IT BELONG TO ANYWAY?! THERE'S MORE STUFF. THEY WERE FRANTICALLY LOADING UP THE BACK OF HERB COPE'S TRUCK AND PUTTING ALL OF ANDY'S BELONGINGS IN IT. OKAY, FINE. I'LL TELL YA. TELL ME WHAT? AND SAM PARRIS SPILLED HIS GUTS. HE PUSHED ME. HE PUSHED TOO HARD. WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? ANDY. MR. COPE SAID HE HAD A TRUCKLOAD OF ANDY'S BELONGINGS AT HIS HOUSE, SO WE WENT TO SEE HIM TO FIND OUT WHAT HE COULD TELL US ABOUT OUR SON. AND MR. COPE TOLD US THE STORY THAT SAM PARRIS TOLD HIM WHEN HE WAS LOADING UP THE CAR. OKAY, FINE. I'LL TELL YA. TELL ME WHAT? SAM PARRIS SPILLED HIS GUTS. HE PUSHED ME. HE PUSHED TOO HARD. WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? ANDY. AND HE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY, AND HE SAID, "AND I TOOK HIM. I TOOK HIS BODY OUT, AND I DUMPED IT DOWN A RAVINE." THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE. HERB COPE? YEAH. HERB COPE MADE A PHONE CALL TO THE POLICE, AND HE TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT BECAUSE THE POLICE THOUGHT HE WAS UNRELIABLE AND BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ARREST WARRANT OUT FOR ANDY MISSING HIS COMMUNITY SERVICE, THE POLICE FELT THAT ANDY HAD JUST TAKEN OFF BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO AVOID BEING ARRESTED. I'M SORRY. I'M VERY SORRY. WE KNEW THAT HERB COPE'S STORY MEANT THAT ANDY WAS DEAD, BUT AS PARENTS, WE WEREN'T READY TO ACCEPT IT THAT EASILY. PAUL FEELS AT THIS TIME THAT WE NEED TO GO LOOK SAM PARRIS DIRECTLY IN THE EYES TO SEE IF HE WOULD TIP HIS HAND, AND I'M NOT GONNA LET HIM GO JUST BY HIMSELF. NO. GO. WAIT HERE. BE CAREFUL. IT WAS REALLY SCARY FOR ME. I'M PAUL. UH, I'M ANDY BUSHARD'S FATHER. YOU'RE ANDY'S FATHER? SAM'S JAW DROPPED. HE WAS OBVIOUSLY SHOCKED TO SEE THAT ANDY, BEING VIETNAMESE, HAD THIS CAUCASIAN FATHER. I UNDERSTAND MY SON WAS LIVING HERE WITH YOU? THAT'S RIGHT. WHAT? UM, ME AND MY WIFE -- WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE AFTER CHRISTMAS, AND WE WERE WONDERING, SINCE HE WAS LIVING UP HERE, IF YOU HAD ANY IDEA WHERE HE MIGHT BE. WELL, I WISH I COULD HELP YOU, BUT, UH, I WAS OUT OF TOWN AT THE TIME. I GOT BACK. HE'D CLEARED OUT. NO NOTE, NO NOTHING. OH, OKAY. THANK YOU. HERB COPE IS YOUR UNCLE, RIGHT? COPE? I DON'T KNOW ANY COPE. I KNOW COPELAND. YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE ABOUT THAT? YOU DON'T KNOW ANY HERB COPE? I DON'T LIKE GETTING THE SAME QUESTION TWICE. YOU HAVE ANY KIDS? UH, NO. AND YOU? FIVE. I'M MISSING ONE. IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT HIM, WILL YOU PLEASE LET ME KNOW? SURE. WILL DO. HE DID IT, DIDN'T HE? AT THAT POINT, WE BELIEVED THAT SAM PARRIS HAD KILLED OUR SON AND THEN HAD CALLED HERB COPE TO COME AND GET ALL OF ANDY'S STUFF. IT WAS HORRIFYING. IT REALLY HIT ME THAT ANDY WAS NOT GOING TO COME IN THROUGH THE BACKDOOR AGAIN. I KNEW IN MY HEART DURING THAT CONVERSATION THAT HE WASN'T EVER COMING BACK. IT'S DEVASTATING. IT'S...THE WORST THING YOU'LL EVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN YOUR LIFE. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? WE WERE SO FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY, BUT WE DIDN'T LET ANGER GET THE BEST OF US. THANK YOU FOR SEEING US. ANDY SPOKE SO HIGHLY OF YOU. OF COURSE. WE DECIDE TO TALK TO SUE GOOD, WHO IS THE COORDINATOR OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LEGAL SERVICES, WHERE ANDY VOLUNTEERS, BECAUSE WE THOUGHT SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT LEGAL RIGHTS WE HAVE HERE, WHAT WE CAN ASK FOR. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK FOR AN INVESTIGATOR ON THIS CASE. WE CAN DO THAT? THEY WON'T DO IT UNLESS YOU MAKE A FORMAL REQUEST, BUT YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE POLICE AND YOU HAVE TO DEMAND AN INVESTIGATOR. SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID. MA'AM, SIR, PLEASE LISTEN. DEPUTY OLIVE WILL BE HERE SOON, AND HE CAN SPEAK TO YOU THEN. I'M SORRY, BUT WE'RE DONE LISTENING. WE KNOW OUR RIGHTS, AND WE ARE FORMALLY REQUESTING AN INVESTIGATOR. AND I SAID, "WE WANT SOMETHING DONE. WE UNDERSTAND WE'RE ENTITLED TO THAT." AND IT EVENTUALLY HAPPENED, BUT ONLY AFTER I INSISTED. HI, CAN I PLEASE HAVE DETECTIVE SQUAD? DALE WAYRAUCH IS THE DETECTIVE ASSIGNED TO ANDY'S CASE. PLEASURE. UM, DETECTIVE, WE'VE BEEN KEEPING DETAILED NOTES OF EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER SINCE OUR SON WENT MISSING. WE KNOW OUR SON ANDY, AND HE WOULD NEVER ABANDON HIS ANIMALS OR HIS CLIENTS AT LEGAL AID. HE WOULDN'T DO THAT. AND HE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T DISAPPEAR WITHOUT SPEAKING TO US. UH, WE HAVE NEW INFORMATION THAT WE'D LIKE YOU TO INVESTIGATE. HERB COPE -- HE TOLD US WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO ANDY, AND WE BELIEVE HIM. WE SPOKE TO SAM PARRIS, AND HE LIED TO PAUL RIGHT TO HIS FACE. WE DON'T THINK YOU'RE GIVING OUR SON A FAIR SHAKE. WELL, MR. AND MRS. BUSHARD, I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR SITUATION. IT MUST BE AWFUL. BUT I'VE LOOKED AT YOUR SON'S FILE, AND EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE CHECKED HAS ALREADY BEEN CHECKED. HE WAS HESITANT TO OPEN THE CASE BECAUSE HE FELT ALSO THAT ANDY HAD JUST TAKEN OFF. AND YOUNG MEN CAN BE IMPULSIVE. DETECTIVE WAYRAUCH STILL FELT THAT THERE WASN'T A CASE THERE, BUT WE WANTED JUSTICE FOR OUR SON. IF YOU'LL MAKE ONE PHONE CALL AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION AFTER THAT ONE PHONE CALL, THEN I'LL DROP THE WHOLE THING. AND MY HEART IS GOING, "NO! NO! THIS IS OUR -- THIS IS OUR CHANCE. YOU DON'T SAY THAT TO HIM." IF YOU COULD PLEASE CALL MR. HERB COPE AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU THINK. I'M THINKING, "WHAT IF IT -- WHAT IF IT DOESN'T GO WELL?" THE POLICE HAD WARNED US THAT HERB COPE WAS UNRELIABLE AND HAD CHANGED HIS STORY MANY TIMES IN THE PAST. NOW WE HAD JUST PUT THE WHOLE CASE IN MR. COPE'S HANDS. SO IF HE DID ANYTHING LIKE THAT THIS TIME, WE WOULD NEVER FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR SON. HERB COPE SR.? YEAH. DETECTIVE DALE WAYRAUCH. YOU MIND ANSWERING A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT ANDY BUSHARD? I SPOKE WITH HERB COPE. IN REGARDS TO YOUR SON'S DISAPPEARANCE... WE'RE OPENING A MURDER CASE. I SPOKE WITH HERB COPE. IN REGARDS TO YOUR SON'S DISAPPEARANCE... WE'RE OPENING A MURDER CASE. THAT WAS HUGE -- HUGE RELIEF, HUGE. "OPENING A MURDER CASE" -- THOSE WERE JUST... OVERWHELMING WORDS. THIS IS OUR SON. MAKE SURE YOU FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED. YOU HAVE MY WORD. DALE WAYRAUCH MAKES TWO TRIPS TO HERB COPE'S HOUSE. THE FIRST TRIP WAS JUST TO INTERVIEW HIM AND TALK TO HIM. THE SECOND TRIP IS TO INSTALL A WIRETAP IN HERB COPE'S PHONE. SAM. WHAT? SAM, IT'S UNCLE HERB. LOOK, THE POLICE ARE STARTING TO ASK ME ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS, AND I NEED YOU TO CLEAR THIS UP ONCE AND FOR ALL. WHAT YOU NEED TO DO, SAM, IS TO GO DOWN TO THE POLICE AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING YOU KNOW. SAM PARRIS SAYS THAT HE, YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT GONNA DO THAT. HE DOESN'T THINK THAT HE'LL DO THAT. BUT HE DOES ADMIT IN THAT PHONE CALL... He -- he pushed me. You think I'm taking that from anybody? Least of all him. ...KILLING OUR SON. SO WHY DID YOU NEED TO GET RID OF ALL OF ANDY BUSHARD'S BELONGINGS? UM, HE OWES ME RENT. HE -- HE SKIPS TOWN. I MEAN, I HAD TO CLEAR HIS CRAP OUT. IT IS MY HOUSE, YOU KNOW. INITIALLY, DURING THAT INTERROGATION, HE'S COOPERATIVE, BUT AS THEY START ASKING MORE QUESTIONS AND POINTING OUT AREAS THAT DON'T JIVE IN WHAT HE'S SAYING AND DON'T MAKE SENSE... WHAT ABOUT THE STORY YOU TOLD YOUR UNCLE? HE GETS CONFUSED, MY UNCLE. SAM, I'VE GOT YOU ON TAPE. THE TAPE DOESN'T GET CONFUSED. THIS IS WEIGHING ON YOU, RIGHT? IT'S OKAY. 'CAUSE WE CAN LIFT THAT LOAD RIGHT NOW. IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE. I SWEAR TO GOD. ...HE FINALLY FOLDS. HE CAME AT ME. JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. WE'RE AT THE HOUSE. IT'S JUST AFTER CHRISTMAS. YOU'RE RIPPING US OFF! YOU'RE OVERCHARGING US FOR UTILITIES! IT WAS JUST AFTER CHRISTMAS WHEN THE OTHER ROOMMATE, JIM, WAS STILL AWAY FOR THE HOLIDAYS. STOP RIPPING US OFF. GUESS WHAT? I WANT YOU OUT. I WANT YOU TONIGHT. I-I'M NOT LEAVING. SAM PARRIS WANTED ANDY TO MOVE OUT, AND HE SAID THEY GOT INTO A HUGE ARGUMENT OVER SOME MONEY THAT ANDY SUPPOSEDLY OWED HIM. AND HE SAID, "I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE." YOU CAN'T JUST EVICT SOMEBODY OVERNIGHT! BUT BECAUSE ANDY VOLUNTEERED FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LEGAL SERVICES, HE KNEW SOME OF THE LEGALITIES OF HIS CASES THAT HE MANAGED ON HOW LONG A TENANT HAD TO GET OUT WHEN THE TENANT WAS ASKED TO LEAVE AND THAT YOU COULDN'T SAY, "YOU NEED TO BE OUT TONIGHT," THAT THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE LAW. THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY -- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?! WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?! YOU'RE CRAZY, I'LL TELL YOU THAT. SO HE PUSHED BACK. AND HE TOLD SAM PARRIS THAT HE WAS NOT GONNA LEAVE THAT EVENING AND THAT HE KNEW WHAT HIS RIGHTS WERE. SAM PARRIS SAID ANDY WAS THREATENING HIM AND THAT HE RAN OUTSIDE... AND THAT HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD A GUN IN ONE OF HIS OUTBUILDINGS. SAM SAID HE CAME BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND ANDY SURPRISED HIM AND HE HAD A KNIFE, SO SAM SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD. HE SAID HE KNEW HE NEEDED TO GET RID OF THE BODY, AND HE JUST WENT ON A DRINKING BINGE, I THINK, FOR DAYS... AND THEN CALLED HERB COPE. THEY ASKED HIM, "WHERE IS ANDY'S BODY?" AFTER HE HAD ADMITTED TO DOING IT. STAY BACK, MA'AM, STAY BACK. GET THAT GUY. YOU GUYS HAVE TO STEP BACK. THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SETS IT UP SO THAT SAM PARRIS IS IN THE PATROL CAR IN THE BACKSEAT. SOMEHOW, IN THIS PROCESS, THE NEWS GETS AHOLD OF THIS, AND THEY'RE OUT THERE, TOO. AND FINALLY, THEY FOUND IT. FINALLY, THEY FOUND THE SPOT, AND... ...THEY WENT DOWN AND RETRIEVED HIS BODY. AND THE PICTURE WAS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE PAPER THE NEXT DAY... WITHOUT A NAME. BUT IT JUST SAID THEY HAD FOUND A BODY. AND THAT WAS EXTREMELY TRAUMATIC TO GO GET THE PAPER AND...SEE THAT. WE'VE ARRESTED SAM PARRIS AND ARE BUILDING A CASE AGAINST HIM. BUT WE STILL NEED TO GET A POSITIVE I.D. ON ANDY. SOMETHING WITH HIS -- HIS DNA. DETECTIVE WAYRAUCH CAME. HE WANTED...SOME THINGS FOR POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION. THIS WAS HIS FIRST HAIRCUT. WILL THIS HELP? IT WAS ALL... FOR PROOF THAT IT WAS HIM. YES, THANK YOU. FORENSIC EVIDENCE PROVED THAT SAM PARRIS' SELF-DEFENSE STORY WASN'T TRUE, AND NOBODY ELSE REALLY KNOWS FOR SURE. BUT BASED ON EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL... I HAVE MY OWN THEORY ON WHAT HAPPENED. I'M -- I'M NOT PAYING THE RENT UNTIL YOU DO THIS FAIRLY. YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANT YOU GONE. I WANT YOU OUT TONIGHT. ACCORDING TO THE PROSECUTORS, SAM PARRIS WAS AN ALCOHOLIC, AND HE HAD FRIENDS THAT HE WOULD CALL AND USE DRUGS WITH. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE NIGHT THAT ANDY WAS MURDERED, SAM HAD BEEN DRINKING AND HE HAD BEEN TAKING DRUGS. I BELIEVE WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IS THAT SAM DID ASK HIM TO MOVE OUT OF THE HOUSE... I WANT YOU OUT. ...AND THAT SAM WANTED HIM OUT RIGHT NOW. HE WANTED HIM GONE. I WANT YOU OUT TONIGHT! AND ANDY SAID HE WASN'T GOING TO MOVE. AND I BELIEVE THAT SAM PARRIS WENT DOWN TO HIS ROOM... GOT THE PISTOL THAT HE USED, AND CAME UPSTAIRS... ...AND SHOT HIM. THE ACTUAL TRAJECTORY OF THE BULLET INDICATED AN EXECUTION-STYLE MURDER RATHER THAN A CASE OF SELF-DEFENSE, AS SAM PARRIS HAD CLAIMED, BECAUSE THE BULLET WENT STRAIGHT INTO ANDY'S FOREHEAD, THROUGH THE BRAIN, AND...DID NOT EXIT, BUT IT LODGED ITSELF OVER HERE IN HIS RIGHT TEMPLE. IT CAME OUT IN THE TRIAL THAT SAM PARRIS HAD HIRED A COMPANY TO REPLACE THE BLOODY CARPET, AND THE MAN WHO DID THE WORK TESTIFIED THAT SAM WAS REFERRING TO ANDY USING A RACIAL SLUR FROM THE VIETNAM WAR. AS IT TURNS OUT, SAM PARRIS WAS A VIETNAM VET. WHAT COMES INTO MY MIND IS HE DID THIS BECAUSE ANDY WAS VIETNAMESE, THAT HE TOOK OUT SOME OF HIS ANGER ON ANDY, THAT HE LOST CONTROL OF HIMSELF. AFTER ONLY SIX HOURS OF TESTIMONY, SAM PARRIS WAS FOUND GUILTY OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. HE WAS SENTENCED TO TWO 25-YEAR-TO-LIFE SENTENCES, 25 YEARS FOR THE MURDER AND 25 YEARS FOR THE USE OF A GUN. SAM PARRIS DIED IN MARCH OF 2015 IN PRISON. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DIED OF, AND I DON'T CARE. THERE ARE TIMES THAT PEOPLE WILL ASK US IF THE RECOVERY OF ANDY'S BODY OR HIS FUNERAL OR THE ENDING OF HIS TRIAL AND HIS SENTENCING HAVE GIVEN US CLOSURE. AND THERE'S NEVER CLOSURE IN THIS TYPE OF...CRIME. IT NEVER GOES AWAY. YOU LEARN TO LIVE WITH IT. IT CHANGES OVER TIME, BUT SLOWLY OVER TIME. THE TRUTH IS, THERE ARE WOUNDS THAT TIME WON'T HEAL, AND THEY CAN EAT YOU ALIVE IF YOU LET THEM. ANDY NEVER REALLY RECOVERED FROM HIS EXPERIENCES IN VIETNAM, AND I THINK SAM PARRIS, IN SOME WAYS, ENDED UP EVEN WORSE. AFTER THE TRIAL, I BECAME INVOLVED IN AN ORGANIZATION CALLED PARENTS OF MURDERED CHILDREN, AND WORKING WITH THEM HELPED ME THROUGH SOME OF MY DARKEST TIMES. YOU NEED TO DO THE GRIEF WORK. IF YOU DON'T DO THE GRIEF WORK... IT'LL BE BACK AT YOUR DOOR AGAIN. ANDY IS A PART OF MY LIFE EVERY DAY. HE'S A PART OF WHO I AM, AND THAT IS SO WONDERFUL.
