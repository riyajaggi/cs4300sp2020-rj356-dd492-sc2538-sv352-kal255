 I HAVE BEEN A TRIAL LAWYER FOR DECADES. I OFTEN REPRESENT PEOPLE I THINK ARE INNOCENT BUT ARE ACCUSED OF MURDER. EVEN TODAY, WORKING ON THE STEVEN AVERY CASE, I GO UP AGAINST IMPOSSIBLE ODDS. YOU NEVER GET USED TO IT. I TOLD SOMEONE ONCE, "IT'S LIKE BEING IN A BOAT. SOMEBODY'S OUT THERE DROWNING. YOU'VE GOT A ROPE. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO THROW IT TO THEM.

 AND YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GONNA BE A FOOT SHORT, AN INCH SHORT, IF THEY'RE GONNA CATCH IT." AND THE THING IS, WITH EACH NEW CASE... ...YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF PERSON IS GOING TO WALK THROUGH THE DOOR. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS FORECAST, PLENTY OF SUNSHINE FOR TODAY WITH SEASONAL TEMPERATURES. WE SHOULD REACH OUR NORMAL HIGH OF 82 DEGREES BY THIS AFTERNOON. DAD. DAD! RILEY'S GONE. WHAT? SHE'S NOT HERE. SHE'S NOT IN THE HOUSE.

 WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BUD? RILEY? RILEY! RILEY IS THE FOXES' 3-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. HER FATHER, KEVIN FOX, HAD PUT HER TO BED THE NIGHT BEFORE ON THE COUCH. RILEY? HER MOTHER, MELISSA, WAS IN CHICAGO THAT WEEKEND DOING A BREAST CANCER WALK. RILEY? RI? THIS ISN'T A GAME. RILEY? KEVIN PICKS UP THE PHONE WHEN HE RETURNS TO THE HOUSE. AND HE CALLS FOR THE WILMINGTON POLICE DEPARTMENT. SHE WAS RIGHT THERE, ON THAT COUCH. AND SHE NEVER LEFT THE HOUSE LIKE THIS BEFORE? NO. OKAY. WE ARE ORGANIZING A SEARCH RIGHT NOW. OKAY. YOU THINK SHE WAS UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING? DID ANYTHING HAPPEN YESTERDAY OR LAST NIGHT? I MADE A HEART. YOU DID IT. YOU KNOW WHAT COLOR -- I WANT TO COLOR IT IN PINK. THAT LOOKS GOOD. YEAH. MELISSA HAD LEFT ON FRIDAY FOR THE AVON BREAST CANCER WALK IN CHICAGO. THEN THE NEXT DAY, THEY STARTED MAKING CONGRATULATORY POSTERS TO MELISSA FOR FINISHING THE RACE. KEVIN AND THE KIDS WERE GOING TO MEET HER AT THE FINISH LINE THE NEXT DAY. I'M DOTTING IT! LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S YOUR THUMBPRINT! KEVIN TOOK BOTH CHILDREN TO MELISSA'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. KEVIN WENT TO A CONCERT THAT NIGHT WITH MELISSA'S BROTHER. WHEN THEY CAME BACK, IT WAS ABOUT 1:00 A.M. HE DECIDED TO GO AND GET THE CHILDREN. HE WANTED TO HAVE THEM DRESSED AND BE ON THE ROAD FOR CHICAGO, WHICH WAS AT LEAST TWO AND A HALF HOURS FROM WILMINGTON. THEY LIKED TO SLEEP IN THE LIVING ROOM SOMETIMES ON THE WEEKEND, SO HE PUT HER ON THE COUCH. TYLER SLEPT NEXT TO HER. KEVIN WALKS BACK OUT THE FRONT DOOR, AND HE STANDS ON THE FRONT PORCH. AND HE SMOKES A CIGARETTE. HE WALKS BACK IN. AND HE REMEMBERS TURNING THE FRONT-DOOR LOCK. THEN HE FALLS INTO A VERY DEEP SLEEP. THE NEXT THING HE REMEMBERS IS TYLER STANDING OVER HIM SAYING, "DAD, RILEY'S GONE." MELISSA IS WALKING TOWARDS THE END OF THE WALK IN CHICAGO. MELISSA. I CAN'T FIND RILEY. IT TOOK A FEW HOURS TO MAKE THE DRIVE BACK TO WILMINGTON. BY THAT TIME, THERE WERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SEARCHING. KEVIN! OH! WHERE'S TYLER? HE'S RIGHT... HEY. HEY, HONEY. GOOD? ALL RIGHT. GOOD. WHEE! HIGHER, DADDY! WHEN RILEY WENT MISSING, EVERYONE FELT THAT THEIR OWN CHILD WAS MISSING. COME ON. PUT ONE HAND RIGHT HERE AND ONE HAND RIGHT HERE. OKAY. I'M GONNA BE RIGHT DOWN HERE. AND I'M GONNA CATCH YOU, OKAY? DADDY, I'M SCARED. I WON'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU. COME ON. I PROMISE. OKAY. COME ON. YOU CAN DO IT. I'M COMING DOWN. COME ON! YEAH. COME ON! YEAH. GREAT JOB. KEVIN FOX PUT HIS DAUGHTER, RILEY, AND HER 7-YEAR-OLD BROTHER, TYLER... THAT AFTERNOON, I HAD THE TELEVISION ON. TYLER WOKE HIS DAD UP EARLY THIS MORNING TO SAY RILEY WAS GONE. THE FRONT DOOR WAS LEFT WIDE OPEN. I'M A MOTHER MYSELF. THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS THE MOST DEVASTATING THING ANY PARENT COULD EVER EXPERIENCE. NOTHING WORSE COULD EVER HAPPEN TO YOU. -RILEY! -RILEY! RILEY? A MOTHER AND HER DAUGHTER WERE SEARCHING DOWN BY FORKED CREEK. RILEY? THE MOTHER THOUGHT SHE SAW A PLASTIC BAG. AND SO SHE WALKED CLOSER. SHE SAW RILEY... RILEY! ...FLOATING FACEDOWN. SCOTT SWEARINGEN BECAME THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR ON THE CASE. OH, MY GOD. THE MEDICAL EXAMINER CONCLUDED THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS DROWNING. AND THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT. DUCT TAPE ON HER MOUTH. BILATERAL FOREARMS DUCT-TAPED TOGETHER. SHE HAD BEEN BOUND WITH HER ARMS TOGETHER AT THE FOREARM. BUT SHE HAD PULLED APART. THE INVESTIGATOR FELT THAT THE DUCT TAPE WASN'T SECURE ENOUGH, THAT SOMEHOW, THEY JUST LOOSELY PUT THE DUCT TAPE ON FOR EFFECT. SCOTT SWEARINGEN SAID THAT THE MOMENT HE WALKED UP, HE KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED. THIS IS NOT A KIDNAPPING AND MURDER. THIS IS A STAGED CRIME SCENE. POLICE SAY WHOEVER KILLED HER TOOK HER TO THESE WOODS TO TRY TO HIDE HER BODY. SENDS CHILLS THROUGH ME BECAUSE I WORRY ABOUT MY 7-YEAR-OLD. THE LITTLE GIRL WHO LOVED PINK IS MOURNED BY FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN THE SMALL SOUTHWEST SUBURBAN TOWN OF WILMINGTON. BITS OF PINK WERE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE FUNERAL SERVICE FOR RILEY FOX. THERE WAS A REAL OUTPOURING OF LOVE FOR KEVIN AND MELISSA. WILMINGTON HAS A POPULATION OF 5,000 PEOPLE. THERE WERE 6,000 PEOPLE THAT SHOWED UP FOR THE FUNERAL. I REMEMBER SEEING IT ON TELEVISION. THE POLICE VIDEOTAPED THE FUNERAL. PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WERE OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHO'D DONE IT. WAS THERE A CHILD KILLER IN THEIR MIDST? WERE THEIR CHILDREN IN DANGER? 3-YEAR-OLD RILEY FOX HAS BEEN DROWNED IN FORKED CREEK. THE POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR A MURDERER. NO ONE EVER LOCKED A DOOR IN WILMINGTON UNTIL THIS HAPPENED. AND PEOPLE SUDDENLY WERE GETTING LOCKS INSTALLED ON THEIR DOORS, BURGLAR ALARMS PUT IN, BUYING GUNS. PEOPLE WERE SCARED. VOLUNTEERS FOUND THE LITTLE GIRL'S BODY IN A CREEK IN THE FORSYTHE WOODS SOME THREE MILES FROM HER HOME. POLICE EXPAND THE INVESTIGATION SUBSTANTIALLY. THEY GET THE NAMES OF ALL THE KNOWN SEX OFFENDERS, GO OUT AND INTERVIEW THEM. THEY CONDUCT NEIGHBORHOOD CANVASSES. THEY INTERVIEW DOZENS AND DOZENS OF PEOPLE. THE OFFICERS SCOTT SWEARINGEN AND MICHAEL GILFOYLE WERE VISITING KEVIN AND MELISSA A LOT. I CAME BACK TO WILMINGTON, PICKED UP THE KIDS FROM MELISSA'S MOM'S HOUSE. AND WE GOT BACK HERE AT ABOUT 1:00 A.M. IN ANY INVESTIGATION WHERE A CHILD HAS BEEN MURDERED, YOU START WITH THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO THE CHILD. AND KEVIN WAS THE LAST-KNOWN PERSON SEEN WITH RILEY. EVERYONE NOTICED, WITH KEVIN, THAT HE WAS PROFOUNDLY DEPRESSED. HE BECAME MUCH MORE ISOLATED. THE POLICE FOLLOW UP ON TIPS. BUT THEY AREN'T ABLE TO REALLY PRODUCE ANYTHING SUBSTANTIAL. MELISSA'S AT HOME WHEN THE PHONE RINGS. AND IT'S SCOTT SWEARINGEN, AND HE SAYS, "WE HAVE SOME REALLY IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS ABOUT OUR INVESTIGATION." I APPRECIATE YOU ALL COMING DOWN TONIGHT. I KNOW IT'S NOT THE BEST TIME. WE WANT TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION AS SOON AS WE CAN. BUT I JUST WANT TO TALK WITH KEVIN ALONE FOR A MINUTE. IS THAT OKAY? YEAH. GREAT. IT WON'T TAKE LONG. MELISSA, YOU CAN TAKE A SEAT HERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT THROUGH THIS DOOR HERE. I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE. OKAY. SEVERAL HOURS GO BY. MELISSA IS SITTING IN A LOCKED ROOM. AND NOBODY HAS COME TO TALK TO HER. HEY! HEY! SCOTT! UGH! MELISSA, STOP! STOP IT! HEY, CALM DOWN. STOP. LISTEN. I'M SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING OUT HERE SO LONG. WE NEED TO KEEP TALKING TO KEVIN. WHY? WHAT IS HAPPENING? WHY DON'T WE SIT FOR A SECOND? NO. JUST TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON! THERE ARE SOME RED FLAGS COMING UP ABOUT KEVIN. WE WANTED TO TALK TO HIM TONIGHT BECAUSE WE FELT LIKE THERE WERE THINGS THAT HE WASN'T TELLING US. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WE THINK HE WAS INVOLVED IN RILEY'S DEATH. NO. NO. HE WOULD NEVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. LISTEN. WE JUST GAVE HIM A POLYGRAPH ABOUT ALL THIS. HE FAILED. I WANT TO SEE THE RESULTS. I DIDN'T DO IT, MELISSA. I SWEAR TO GOD I DIDN'T DO IT. RICH, CAN YOU SHOW HER THE RESULTS? YEAH. YOU SEE ALL THIS, THAT RED? THAT'S ALL LIES. SO ALL THESE QUESTIONS, HE LIED. HE FLUNKED THE WHOLE THING. MELISSA IS IN SHOCK. SHE CALLS KEVIN'S BROTHER, CHAD, RIGHT AWAY. HI, CHAD? YEAH. WE'RE AT THE POLICE STATION. NO. UM, NO, IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD. MORNING. MS. ZELLNER? CAN I HELP YOU? I'M CHAD FOX. OKAY. LOOK, I -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS KILLED IN WILMINGTON. YEAH, RILEY FOX. LOOK, KEVIN FOX IS MY BROTHER. I THINK HE NEEDS AN ATTORNEY. THEY'VE BEEN INTERROGATING HIM AT THE WILL COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE ALL NIGHT. THEY THINK HE DID IT. THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF. IS HE STILL BEING INTERROGATED? I THINK SO. WE NEED TO GET THERE. RIGHT NOW. WE GOT DOWN THERE IMMEDIATELY. I RECOGNIZE MELISSA FROM HER PICTURES. SHE LOOKS TERRIBLE. SHE'S CRYING. SO I KNOW SOMETHING REALLY BAD'S ALREADY HAPPENED. CAN I HELP YOU? I'M KEVIN FOX'S ATTORNEY. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH HIM IMMEDIATELY. OKAY. BUT YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO SPEAK WITH HIM AT THE JAIL. HE'S JUST CONFESSED TO THE MURDER. BACK IN JUNE, 3-YEAR-OLD RILEY FOX DISAPPEARED FROM HER WILMINGTON HOME. THE GIRL'S FATHER, KEVIN FOX, HAS GIVEN A VIDEOTAPED STATEMENT IMPLICATING HIMSELF. LAW ENFORCEMENT WON'T SAY WHY HE ALLEGEDLY CHANGED HIS TUNE. WHAT DO THE POLICE KNOW THAT I DON'T KNOW? WHAT WAS SAID IN THE CONFESSION? HE LOOKS GUILTY. HE LOOKS DEFEATED. HE LOOKS LIKE IT'S OVER. IN MY MIND, I'M THINKING, "DO I WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS? WHAT AM I GETTING INTO?" KEVIN, THIS IS KATHLEEN ZELLNER. SHE'S GONNA BE YOUR ATTORNEY. I WAS DIRECTLY LOOKING INTO HIS EYES, THEN I COULD REALLY ASSESS HIM. AND HE SAID, "THEY TRICKED ME. THEY TRICKED ME." AND I SAID, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THEY TRICKED YOU?" THEY SAID THAT IF I JUST SAID IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT THEY WOULD GIVE ME INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. THEY TOLD ME THAT I COULD BOND OUT AND THAT I COULD GET AN ATTORNEY AND -- AND FIGURE EVERYTHING OUT. I HAD INTERVIEWED SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAD COMMITTED MURDERS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I ALWAYS NOTICED WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO THEM IS THAT KILLERS USUALLY HAVE DEAD EYES. I'M GONNA GO NOW AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE CHARGING YOU WITH. OKAY. BUT I'LL BE BACK HERE TOMORROW. OKAY? ANGER AND BETRAYAL IN THIS SMALL TOWN THIS EVENING. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT, NO. I'D SAY HE WAS A LOVING FATHER, TOTALLY. WE'VE BEEN TO THE -- THE CEREMONIES. WE'VE -- THE BENEFITS, THE EVERYTHING FOR THE FAMILY. IT'S ALL BEEN AN ACT. ONCE IT WAS PUBLICIZED THAT KEVIN HAD CONFESSED TO THE CRIME, THE TOWN COMPLETELY TURNED ON KEVIN AND MELISSA AND THEIR FAMILIES. BUT NOW YOU THINK IT WAS ALL AN ACT? YEAH. LIKE MANY WILMINGTON RESIDENTS -- WERE THEY REALLY TALKING ABOUT YOU AND DADDY? NO. NO, THEY ARE NOT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEY WENT FROM BEING THE MOST POPULAR COUPLE IN THE TOWN TO BEING PEOPLE THAT WERE REVILED. THERE'S NOTHING MORE PRESSURED FOR AN ATTORNEY THAN REPRESENTING SOMEONE WHO'S INNOCENT, WHERE IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR ABILITY, HOW DEDICATED YOU ARE TO IT. IN MY OWN FAMILY, I HAD TWO BROTHERS WHO DIED. SO THE DEATH OF A CHILD RESONATED, IN A WAY, WITH ME THAT IT MIGHT NOT HAVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAD NOT HAD THAT EXPERIENCE. SO I JUST DECIDED, "I'M IN IT THE WHOLE WAY." I LOOK AT THIS AND THINK, "THIS IS GONNA BE IMPOSSIBLE." WHENEVER YOU HAVE A CONFESSION, THERE'S ABOUT A 99.9% CHANCE OF A CONVICTION UNLESS YOU HAVE FORENSIC EVIDENCE. KEVIN'S CONFESSION CONSISTED OF HIS STORY THAT HE BROUGHT THE CHILDREN HOME AS HE SAID HE HAD DONE. BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM, RILEY GOES INTO THE BATHROOM. HE GOES IN, SWINGS OPEN THE DOOR, HITS HER IN THE HEAD. SHE IS KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS. HE THINKS THAT HE'S KILLED HER. HE DECIDES TO STAGE THAT ACCIDENT AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A MURDER. SO HE GETS DUCT TAPE OUT OF HIS TRUCK. HE DUCT-TAPED HER ARMS, HER MOUTH, CARRIED HER OUT, PUT HER IN THE BACK OF HIS TRUCK, DROVE HER OUT TO FORSYTHE WOODS AND PUT HER IN THE WATER SO SHE WOULD FLOAT AWAY. ONE OF MY PRIMARY GOALS WHEN I TOOK THE CASE WAS TO GET A COPY OF THE VIDEOTAPE OF KEVIN'S CONFESSION. RILEY WAS IN THE BATHROOM? THAT'S WHEN YOU HIT HER IN THE HEAD WITH THE BATHROOM DOOR? I WANTED TO WATCH IT ON A BIG SCREEN 'CAUSE I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO SEE ALL THE DETAILS OF IT. YOU WRAPPED HER ARMS, LEGS, MOUTH WITH DUCT TAPE. I WANTED TO REALLY STUDY KEVIN'S CONFESSION TO THE MURDER OF HIS DAUGHTER, RILEY. I SAW IT AS AN EMOTIONALLY TRAUMATIZED PERSON. THE WAY HE WAS SLUMPED IN THE CHAIR AND HOW EXHAUSTED HE WAS, IT WAS AS IF HE WAS DETACHED FROM THE WHOLE THING. WHEN YOU CONFESS TO A HORRIBLE CRIME, CONFESS TO WHAT'S NOT IN YOUR SELF-INTEREST, THAT'S TRUE THAT THAT'S THE TRUTH. AND YOU'RE GONNA BE CONVICTED. PUT HER IN THE TRUNK OF YOUR CAR. YOU DROVE HER TO THE RIVER. YEAH. THEY RECORD 20 MINUTES OF THE 14 HOURS. SO THEY RECORD 2% OF THE ENTIRE INTERACTION WITH HIM. BUT THE THING THAT STRUCK ME, OVERALL, WAS THE POLICE WERE GIVING HIM ALL THE ANSWERS. I KNEW THAT WE HAD TO HAVE FORENSIC EVIDENCE. SO I WENT TO THE FOX HOUSE. MY FIRST AREA OF INQUIRY WAS ABOUT THE DOOR. SO HE STARTS IN THE BEDROOM AND MOVES TO THE BATHROOM. RIGHT. RIGHT. RILEY'S ALREADY IN THERE. OKAY. THEN HE QUICKLY OPENS THE DOOR AND... THE DOOR DIDN'T SWING IN. IT SWUNG OUT. SO HOW DOES HE HIT HER? HE CAN'T. SO WHY DID KEVIN SAY HE DID IT? I MEAN, HE KNOWS HIS OWN HOUSE. UNLESS SOMEONE TOLD HIM TO SAY IT. AFTER WATCHING THE TAPED CONFESSION AND LEARNING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE DOOR, I KNEW THAT KEVIN WAS INNOCENT. AND IF KEVIN WAS INNOCENT, THEN THE KILLER WAS STILL OUT THERE. KEVIN IS STILL INCARCERATED. BUT NOW I BELIEVE HIS CONFESSION WAS COERCED. I WANT KEVIN TO GO THROUGH THE INTERROGATION IN DETAIL, WHAT THEY SAID, WHAT HE SAID. I WANT TO KNOW THE EXACT QUOTES. AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIM MENTALLY. I WANT YOU TO TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY INTERROGATED YOU. WHEN I FIRST GOT IN THERE, EVERYTHING WAS FINE. I'M JUST CURIOUS. YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS STORY BEFORE. AND YOU CALLED ME, SAID THAT YOU HAD SOME NEW INFORMATION. WHAT'S THE DEAL? KEVIN, WE THINK YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY? WE HAVE SURVEILLANCE OF YOUR CAR AT A GAS STATION BETWEEN YOUR HOUSE AND FORSYTHE WOODS AT 4:00 A.M. I DIDN'T DRIVE TO THE GAS STATION. THEN WHO DID? I REVIEWED THE GAS STATION VIDEO FOOTAGE AND LEARNED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT THE VEHICLE THE FOXES HAD. IT WASN'T EVEN THE SAME MODEL OR MAKE. THIS WAS ALL INTENDED TO RATTLE KEVIN. SIT DOWN! I WANT MY DAD! I WANT HIM TO GET ME A LAWYER. YOU'RE 27 YEARS OLD. YOU DON'T NEED YOUR FATHER IN HERE. THE INTERROGATION SHOULD HAVE STOPPED. SIT DOWN. ONCE HE ASKED FOR A LAWYER, THEY SHOULD HAVE EITHER ARRESTED HIM OR LET HIM GO. BUT THEY DIDN'T. AND AFTER FIVE HOURS, HE'S STILL THERE. AND HE'S DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. YOU TAKE A POLYGRAPH ON THIS RIGHT NOW. YOU PASS THAT, YOU CAN GO HOME. OKAY. IS YOUR NAME KEVIN FOX? YES. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW RILEY? A POLYGRAPH SHOULD NEVER BE GIVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERROGATION. SOMEONE'S UNDER ENORMOUS STRESS. AND IT PRODUCES INACCURATE RESULTS. WHAT TIME DID YOU PUT THE KIDS TO BED? IT DIDN'T MATTER AT ALL TO ME. BUT IT MATTERED VERY MUCH TO HIM, MENTALLY, THAT HE JUST FLUNKED THE POLYGRAPH. THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT 'CAUSE HE THOUGHT, "OF COURSE I'LL PASS IT, AND THEN I'LL LEAVE." AND SUDDENLY, HE'S MADE IT WORSE. AFTER MELISSA SEES THE POLYGRAPH RESULTS, SHE IS DEVASTATED. AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING, KEVIN'S BEEN UP FOR MORE THAN 24 HOURS. ED HAYES IS THE LIEUTENANT WHO THEN COMES INTO THIS INTERROGATION. IF I GET TO THE END OF THIS FORM AND YOU HAVEN'T TOLD US YOUR STORY... ...I'M GONNA CHARGE YOU WITH FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. THAT'S 30 YEARS TO LIFE. ARE YOU LISTENING? LOOK AT ME. I'M GONNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET RAPED EVERY SINGLE DAY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? ED HAYES HAD GOTTEN THE CRIME-SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS OF RILEY FOX LYING ON THE CREEK. KEVIN HAD NEVER SEEN THOSE PHOTOS. HE SAID TO ME, "THERE'S MY DAUGHTER COVERED IN MUD. AND NOBODY HAD THE DECENCY TO WIPE OFF HER FACE." THAT WAS A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR HIM, MENTALLY. IT TOOK AWAY EVERYTHING INSIDE OF HIM THAT MADE HIM WANT TO SURVIVE. HE SAID TO ME, "WHEN I SAW THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS, I FELT LIKE I HAD SO FAILED HER. IF I JUST HAD PUT THEM IN THE BED WITH ME, LIKE WE ALWAYS DID THAT," HE SAID, "NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED." AND HE SAID, "RIGHT BEFORE SHE DIED, I KNOW SHE WAS CALLING FOR ME." I WON'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU. COME ON. I PROMISE. OKAY. HE WOULD TELL HER, "I'M ALWAYS GOING TO BE THERE. I'M ALWAYS GOING TO PROTECT YOU. NOTHING WILL EVER HAPPEN TO YOU." THAT'S WHAT CHANGED EVERYTHING. HE DIDN'T CARE ANYMORE. HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT HIMSELF. THEY COMPLETELY TAPPED INTO IT. KEVIN. THIS IS WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU. YOU TELL US RIGHT NOW THAT THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT. WE'LL GIVE YOU INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. IT'S A TWO- TO FIVE-YEAR SENTENCE. YOU'LL BOND OUT RIGHT AWAY. THIS WILL ALL BE DONE. TWO TO FIVE YEARS, IT'S BETTER THAN 30, KEVIN. ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, WENT TO THE BATHROOM. YEAH. RILEY WAS IN THE BATHROOM. THAT'S WHEN YOU HIT HER IN THE HEAD WITH THE BATHROOM DOOR. YEAH. I THOUGHT I COULD BOND OUT. THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME. I -- THEN I COULD HIRE A LAWYER AND -- AND FIGURE THIS WHOLE THING OUT. BUT THAT'S WHY HE DID IT. THAT MENTALLY EXPLAINED TO ME, "OKAY. THIS IS WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS GOING ON." WHILE I BELIEVED KEVIN, THAT MEANT NOTHING WITHOUT HARD EVIDENCE TO BACK IT UP. I NEEDED DNA. MRS. ZELLNER? JUST CAME IN TODAY. THANK YOU. WE FINALLY GET THE ILLINOIS STATE POLICE LAB REPORT OF RILEY'S AUTOPSY. THAT REPORT INDICATES THAT THERE IS NO DNA IN BLOOD OR SEMEN. AND THEN IT STATES, "INCONCLUSIVE FOR SALIVA." I'M EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AT WHAT I'M SEEING BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FINDING ANYTHING. WITHOUT DNA, I KNEW WE WOULD LOSE. BUT I WAS LOOKING AT THAT WORD, "INCONCLUSIVE," WHICH DIDN'T NECESSARILY MEAN NEGATIVE. I CALLED THE FORENSIC SCIENTIST TO ASK HIM ABOUT IT. Hello? HI, JOHN. IT'S KATHLEEN ZELLNER. Hi, Kathleen. I'M LOOKING AT SOME LAB RESULTS THAT I GOT BACK FOR A CASE I'M WORKING ON. AND IT SAYS, "INCONCLUSIVE." That's code for when a lab doesn't have the most sophisticated technology to detect DNA in saliva. WELL, I'M REALLY AT A LOSS HERE. I MEAN, WHO HAS THE TECHNOLOGY? You can always try a private lab. IF THIS DOESN'T WORK, NOW THAT I KNOW HOW THEY WENT ABOUT GETTING THE CONFESSION, I DON'T REALLY WANT TO REMAIN A MEMBER OF THE LEGAL COMMUNITY. SO I HAD THE SAMPLE FROM RILEY'S AUTOPSY TESTED AT A PRIVATE LAB. I WAS WAITING FOR THE DNA RESULTS. I RECEIVED A CALL THAT THE TEST RESULTS WERE READY. AND SO I TOLD HER THAT I NEEDED TO HAVE EVERYTHING IN A WRITTEN FORMAT AND THAT I WANTED TO BE WITH THE STATE'S ATTORNEY WHEN THAT WRITTEN DOCUMENT WAS DISCLOSED. SO I ARRIVE. HE'S NOT THERE. IT WAS, TO THAT POINT, THE LONGEST HOUR OF MY LIFE. WHEN THE STATE'S ATTORNEY FINALLY ARRIVED, HE SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU AND I STAND BY THE FAX MACHINE?" ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GET IT ANY SECOND HERE. AND THEN WE SAW THE RESULT AT THE END. OH, MY GOD. THERE WAS A SMALL SAMPLE THAT PRODUCED A PARTIAL PROFILE OF ANOTHER MALE. SO WE KNEW THAT WAS THE KILLER. KEVIN FOX HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXCLUDED. THE DNA's EXCLUDED YOU. YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME TOMORROW. OKAY. HE SEEMED LIKE HE WAS IN SHOCK. SO IT'S OVER. YOU'RE GONNA GET YOUR LIFE BACK. THAT'S REALLY GREAT. THANK YOU. THE MESSAGE THAT I DELIVERED THAT DAY, WHEN HE GOT OUT, WAS THAT WE WERE THRILLED KEVIN WAS OUT. WE KNEW HE WAS INNOCENT. BUT THERE WAS STILL A CHILD KILLER, THAT THEIR CHILD HAD BEEN KILLED BY A VICIOUS, DEPRAVED KILLER. AND THAT PERSON WAS STILL FREE. AFTER EIGHT MONTHS OF INCARCERATION, THE CHARGES WERE DROPPED. AND KEVIN WAS RELEASED FROM JAIL. WE THOUGHT THAT THE CASE WAS BEYOND THE CAPABILITY OF THE WILL COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. NOW THAT THEY HAD DNA, THE FBI RE-CANVASSED THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN CASE THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES MISSED ANYTHING THE FIRST TIME. ONE WOMAN, WHO HAD BEEN QUESTIONED PREVIOUSLY, TOLD THEM THAT SHE AND HER EX-BOYFRIEND, SCOTT EBY, HAD BEEN WALKING BY THE FOX HOUSE. AND SHE MADE THE COMMENT THAT SHE COULDN'T FATHOM WHAT KIND OF PERSON WOULD KILL A CHILD. AND SHE SAID THAT HER EX-BOYFRIEND'S RESPONSE WAS THAT HE GOT A LITTLE SMILE. AND HE SAID, SARCASTICALLY, "YEAH, THAT WAS REALLY AWFUL, WASN'T IT?" AND SHE SAID IT WAS THE TONE OF HIS VOICE AND HIS EXPRESSION, JUST SENT A CHILL UP HER SPINE. SO THE FBI FOUND OUT THAT SCOTT EBY WAS INCARCERATED ON SEXUALLY MOLESTING HIS SISTER. THEY GO TO VISIT SCOTT EBY. AND THEY ASKED HIM A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING ON JUNE 6th. AND THEY TELL HIM THEY WANT HIS DNA. THE DNA RESULTS CAME BACK IN 24 HOURS. AND IT MATCHED THE PARTIAL PROFILE. AND HE GAVE A TOTAL CONFESSION. SCOTT EBY CONFESSES THAT ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER, HE HAD BEEN USING COCAINE AND DRINKING. HE DECIDED TO BURGLARIZE A HOUSE. HE STARTED WITH A HOUSE IN THE FOX NEIGHBORHOOD. WHEN HE LEFT THAT HOUSE, HE LOOKED NEXT DOOR TOWARDS THE FOX RESIDENCE. AND HE COULD SEE A SWING SET. SO HE KNEW THAT CHILDREN LIVED THERE. HE WAS ABLE TO JUST PUSH THE BACK DOOR OPEN. HE REALIZES KEVIN'S IN A REALLY DEEP SLEEP. AND THIS FAN IS BLOWING, CREATING A LOT OF NOISE. HE LIFTS HER UP. AND HE OPENS THE FRONT DOOR... ...OPENS THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR AND PUTS HER IN THE TRUNK. HE DRIVES TO FORSYTHE WOODS, TAKES HER OUT OF THE TRUNK. AND HE TAKES HER IN THE MEN'S ROOM AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTS HER. HIS BANDANNA SLIPS ON HIS FACE. AND HE SAID SHE LOOKS DIRECTLY AT HIM. HE BELIEVES THAT SHE CAN IDENTIFY HIM. SO HE DUCT-TAPES HER FOREARMS TOGETHER. AND THEN HE ALSO DUCT-TAPES HER MOUTH BECAUSE SHE'S TALKING TO HIM UP UNTIL THAT POINT BECAUSE THE LAST THING THAT SHE SAYS TO HIM IS, "I WANT MY DADDY." HE SAYS, "I TOOK HER, THEN, TO THE CREEK. AND I STEPPED IN. AND I HELD HER DOWN UNTIL SHE STOPPED SQUIRMING." IF SCOTT EBY HAD BEEN CAUGHT ON JUNE 6th, AS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN, HE WOULD NOT HAVE GONE ON TO MOLEST HIS OWN SISTER. POLICE MISSED SCOTT EBY BECAUSE THEY WERE BLINDED BY THEIR OBSESSION WITH KEVIN FOX. THE INVESTIGATION TOOK A COMPLETE LEFT TURN WHEN THEY CALLED KEVIN INTO THE INTERROGATION. IN ADDITION TO LOSING THEIR DAUGHTER, KEVIN AND MELISSA WERE FURTHER DAMAGED BY THESE INVESTIGATORS' ABUSE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE FILED A CIVIL SUIT AGAINST THE WILL COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT FOR THIS ABUSE. THERE WAS NO GOOD FAITH IN THIS. THERE WAS MALICE. THAT'S WHAT A CIVIL JURY FOUND. THEY AWARDED THE FOXES MORE THAN $15 MILLION FOR THESE CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, MORE THAN ANY OTHER CASE OF ITS KIND. THE RILEY FOX CASE, OF ALL MY CASES, WAS, FOR ME, PERSONALLY, THE MOST TRAUMATIC. BUT GOING THROUGH THAT WITH A FAMILY AFFECTED ME IN A POSITIVE WAY. IT MADE ME MORE DETERMINED IN THOSE SITUATIONS. WHAT AM I GONNA DO TONIGHT? SPEND -- SPEND THE NIGHT WITH MY -- MY WIFE AND SON. MY CAREER HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO TRYING TO CORRECT INJUSTICES THAT HAVE OCCURRED WITHIN THE LEGAL SYSTEM. THE MURDER OF LITTLE RILEY FOX. I'M STILL DOING IT BECAUSE, SINCE KEVIN FOX, I'VE HAD FOUR MORE. AND I'M WORKING ON A FIFTH ONE NOW. SO I'M DRAWN TO IT. LIKE, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T REALLY GET AWAY FROM IT.
