 DADDY! I GOT NERVOUS 'CAUSE HE WASN'T ANSWERING, BUT I -- I DIDN'T WANT TO TOUCH HIM 'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS HURT. I RAN ACROSS TO THE CASSIS' HOUSE. I WAS SCREAMING, "YOU GOTTA HELP MY FATHER." BIG MIKE WENT RUNNING TO MY DAD. JAMES? JAMES, ARE YOU OKAY? AT THAT POINT, ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS BEING WITH MY 8-YEAR-OLD SISTER 'CAUSE SHE WAS STILL SLEEPING, FROM WHAT I KNEW. SWEETIE. JOANNE, SWEETIE, WAKE UP. UM...SO LOOK. DADDY FELL, AND HE HIT HIS HEAD, BUT BIG MIKE'S WITH HIM, AND HE'S GETTING HIM, OKAY? -I-I WANT TO GO SEE. -SHH, HEY, NO, NO. YOU'RE JUST GONNA WAIT HERE UNTIL HE GETS HELP, OKAY? A FEW HOURS LATER, WE WERE JUST SITTING AT THE TABLE, WAITING. THE AMBULANCE WAS THERE. THEY WERE ALL AROUND HIM. SO I COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. WE WERE ALL BASICALLY JUST WAITING FOR SOME ANSWERS. GIRLS, I'M LIEUTENANT DON, THIS IS DETECTIVE McCREADY. WE'RE VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. WHAT? DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO WOULD HAVE WANTED TO KILL YOUR FATHER? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WE WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT SOMEONE TOLD YOU. TOLD ME WHAT? YOUR FATHER IS DEAD. WHAT? NO, NO, HE JUST SLIPPED! I WAS SHOCKED. I DIDN'T -- I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ACT 'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS HEARING HIM CORRECTLY. YOUR FATHER WAS SHOT. COME HERE. MY DAD WAS REALLY DEAD. NOW WE WERE COMPLETELY ALONE, 'CAUSE IT WAS ALMOST A YEAR TO THE DAY THAT MY MOM HAD DIED. CLOSE YOUR EYES. NO PEEKING. -HOLD YOUR HORSES. -HOLD ON. -I ALMOST GOT IT. -JUST A SECOND. HURRY! OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THESE CANDLES, A TRICK. -KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED, SWEETIE. -ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE. -ALL RIGHT. -OKAY. HERE WE GO! I FIRST SAW HOW SICK MY MOM REALLY WAS AROUND MY SISTER'S BIRTHDAY. MY FATHER WANTED TO TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL AND SHE SAID, "ABSOLUTELY NOT. ONE MORE DAY IS NOT GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE." THIS IS A SPECIAL DAY, I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL IT. OKAY, READY, SWEETIE? ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, "BIRTHDAYS WERE BIG. BIRTHDAYS WERE IMPORTANT IN OUR FAMILY." OPEN YOUR EYES! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! AWESOME. I NEVER THOUGHT SHE WOULD DIE. I REALLY DIDN'T. I PRAYED A LOT FOR GOD NOT TO TAKE HER BECAUSE WE NEEDED HER. AND NOW MY FATHER WAS GONE, TOO. THEY'RE ALL .22s. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE OVER BY THE TREE. FIRST SHOT FROM OVER THERE. THEN, HE WALKED UP AND FINISHED IT OFF. LOOKS LIKE EXECUTION STYLE. OH, MY GOD! IT'S JAMES! FROM INSIDE THE KITCHEN, I COULD HEAR MY AUNT, MARILYN, SCREAMING. OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD! THAT'S GRANDMA AND AUNT MARILYN. COME ON. WE HAVE TO GO. MA'AM, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BACK UP. I DON'T THINK SO, THAT'S MY BROTHER! YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BACK UP BEHIND THE TAPE. THIS IS AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION. -NO, LET ME SEE MY BROTHER! -PLEASE BACK UP. WHAT HAPPENED? IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. I PROMISE YOU, OKAY? IT'S GONNA BE JUST LIKE WHEN... THEY BASICALLY TOOK OVER THE WHOLE HOUSE AND JUST, LIKE, MADE THEMSELVES AT HOME. WHICH I THOUGHT WAS VERY ODD, BECAUSE MY FATHER REALLY DIDN'T GET ALONG WITH HIS SISTER AND DIDN'T SEE HIS MOTHER TOO OFTEN. WE'RE JUST GONNA BE A REAL FAMILY AGAIN, OKAY? I PROMISE. SOME WOULD SAY ABOUT HIM THAT HE WAS A LOUD-MOUTH, HAD A BAD TEMPER. BUT THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER SIDE OF HIM. THEY WOULD CALL HIM, LIKE, A ROUGH, TOUGH CREAM PUFF. YOU KNOW, HE, UH... HAD A VERY ROUGH EXTERIOR ABOUT HIM, BUT IF HE COULD HELP YOU, HE WOULD. PRETTY SOON THE HOUSE WAS CRAWLING WITH COPS. DETECTIVES SEEMED REALLY BAFFLED THAT A SUBURBAN FATHER OF THREE WOULD BE LAYING, SHOT, IN THE DRIVEWAY. WHAT IS THIS? OUR HOUSE ALSO HAD A VERY HIGH-TECH ALARM SYSTEM. THE HELL'S HE NEED ALL THAT FOR? NOT MANY PEOPLE KNEW MY DAD WAS LOAN SHARK. THEY CAME ACROSS THE LEDGER OF EVERYBODY'S NAME AND DATE FOR MONEY THAT THEY HAD BORROWED. MAYBE HE WAS AFRAID SOMEONE WAS OUT TO GET HIM. MY FATHER WAS FOUND SHOT IN OUR DRIVEWAY. THE POLICE THOUGHT HE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT HIMSELF FROM SOMEBODY BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD A LOT OF GUNS THAT HE COLLECTED, A LOT OF GUNS THAT NORMAL PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE ANY USE FOR. HE'S GOT SOME ARSENAL HERE. TELL ME ABOUT IT. THEY WERE THINKING THAT MAYBE IT WAS SOMEBODY THAT OWED HIM MONEY, THAT COULDN'T PAY THEIR DEBT AND WANTED HIM DEAD. OR IT WAS THE MAFIA, BECAUSE IT WAS AN EXECUTION-STYLE MURDER. I FELT REALLY SCARED AND ALONE, AND I NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO, SO I CALLED MY BOYFRIEND, ROB, TO TELL HIM WHAT WAS HAPPENING. HELLO? Rob? CHERYL? WHAT'S WRONG? MY FATHER IS DEAD. DEAD? A YEAR AGO, AROUND FEBRUARY 13th, MY MOM HAD PASSED AWAY. I WENT TO SCHOOL TO GET MY BOOKS. ALL OF A SUDDEN, I LOOKED UP, AND I SAW ROB STANDING NEXT TO ME, AND HE WAS HOLDING A RED CARNATION BECAUSE OUR SCHOOL WAS SELLING THEM FOR VALENTINE'S DAY. WHEN I LOOKED AT HIM, HOLDING THE CARNATION, I JUST STARTED TO CRY. IF IT'S THE FLOWER, I CAN THROW IT OUT. WHAT'S WRONG? MY MOM DIED YESTERDAY, ROB. IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO, I... WOULD YOU COME TO THE FUNERAL WITH ME? YES, OF COURSE. I-I'LL BE THERE. I'M SORRY, I HAVE TO GO. ROB CAME TO THE FUNERAL. THAT WAS SUCH A LOW POINT IN MY LIFE. I REALLY FELT LIKE HE PROTECTED ME, TOOK CARE OF ME AND WORRIED ABOUT ME, AND SO I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM. I THINK... I THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIM IN OUR DRIVEWAY. The police are here. AND HE SAID, "ALL RIGHT, I'M COMING THERE NOW." AND I SAID, "NO. DON'T COME NOW." I SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT GOING ON." I SAID, "MAYBE YOU COULD COME LATER." AND HE SAID OKAY. MY BROTHER, JIMMY, CAME OVER LATER THAT AFTERNOON. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, GRAM AND AUNT MARILYN ARE HERE? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? GLAD YOU COULD, UH, JOIN US, JIMMY. IT'S OKAY, OKAY? JIMMY WAS UPSET BECAUSE WHEN MY MOTHER WAS SICK, WE BARELY SAW MY AUNT AND GRANDMOTHER. BUT NOW THAT MY FATHER HAD DIED, THEY'RE TAKING OVER THE HOUSE LIKE THEY OWNED IT. AND HE REALIZED THAT THE DETECTIVES WERE STILL THERE, LOOKING AROUND THE HOUSE. HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? HUH? LOOK AT THIS MESS! I'M LIEUTENANT DON, THIS IS DETECTIVE MCCREADY... YEAH, MY FATHER JUST DIED AND YOU'RE ALREADY SNOOPING THROUGH HIS STUFF? HEY, WE'RE INVESTIGATING YOUR FATHER'S HOMICIDE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT? YOU JUST BETTER LEAVE. MY BROTHER FELT LIKE IT WAS HIS DUTY TO STEP UP AND PROTECT THE FAMILY. THAT'S HOW MY FATHER HAD RAISED HIM AND TAUGHT HIM TO DO. YOU CAN'T INTERFERE WITH AN INVESTIGATION. OH, YEAH? LET ME SEE YOUR WARRANT. IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A POWER STRUGGLE. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. LEAVE! AND THE POLICE THOUGHT, LIKE, HE WAS TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING. BUT THERE WAS NO WAY JIMMY WAS GONNA TALK TO THEM. SO THE NEXT DAY, THE DETECTIVES TRACKED DOWN SOME OF MY FATHER'S FRIENDS. YOU MIND IF I SIT DOWN? MY NAME IS DETECTIVE MCCREADY. I HEAR YOU WERE FRIENDS WITH JAMES PIERSON. WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT HIM? SURE, HE WAS A LOUD MOUTH, BUT HE'D GIVE YOU THE SHIRT OFF HIS BACK. AND CHARGE YOU INTEREST, THOUGH. I NOTICE HE HAD A COLLECTION OF FIREARMS AT HIS HOME. OH, YEAH. HE LOVED HIS GUNS. "AMAZING COLLECTION." VERY PROUD OF THAT. ANY CHANCE HE HAD CONNECTIONS WITH THE MOB? ANY FOLKS WITH A GRUDGE? SOME SCORE TO SETTLE? HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIS SON, JIMMY? YEAH, WE'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING. JIMMY AND MY FATHER HAD THEIR TROUBLES. MY BROTHER WAS NOT GONNA ALLOW MY FATHER TO DICTATE TO HIM HOW HE LIVES. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? MY FATHER WAS NOT GOOD AT DEALING WITH THAT. WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE? I'M MOVING OUT. OH, YEAH? WHERE YOU GONNA LIVE, HUH? YOU BUM. AT THE TIME, WHILE, YOU KNOW, HE WAS STILL LIVING UNDER MY FATHER'S ROOF, HE DID HAVE A LOT OF ANGER, YOU KNOW, TOWARDS MY FATHER. YEAH, HIM AND HIS POP, THEY BUTT HEADS FOR YEARS. JAMES NEVER REALLY DID TRUST HIM, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO MONEY. YEAH, AND, UM... THEY DIDN'T EXACTLY SEE EYE TO EYE ABOUT, UM, YOU KNOW, HIS LIFESTYLE CHOICES. HE DIDN'T LIKE MY FATHER'S RULES, AND HE DECIDED TO MOVE OUT. WHO'S GONNA GIVE YOU A LEASE DRESSED LIKE THAT, HUH? LOOKING LIKE SOME FLAMING MARY. LOOK AT YOU! I'M EMBARRASSED TO CALL YOU MY SON. THE FEELING'S MUTUAL. -OH, YEAH? -YEAH. YEAH? NO MORE HANDOUTS, THEN, YOU HEAR ME? NO MORE MOOCHING! I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY. I'M CUTTING YOU OFF, TAKING YOU OUT OF THE WILL. HE WANTS TO BE IN CONTROL OF EVERYBODY. THE ONE THING HE COULDN'T CONTROL WAS MY BROTHER, AND THERE WAS SOME HEARTACHE THERE. YOU'RE DEAD TO ME. THE INVESTIGATORS FIND OUT THAT MY FATHER HAS A LOT OF MONEY IN THE BANK. I BELIEVE IT WAS WELL OVER 500,000, AND THEY HAD FOUND THAT MY FATHER HAD TAKEN HIM OFF SOME ACCOUNTS. IT TURNS OUT JAMES' LAWYER WAS WORKING ON GETTING JIMMY OUT OF THE WILL. GUESS IT'S TIME FOR A LITTLE CHAT WITH JIMMY. MY BROTHER WAS TOTALLY TAKEN OUT OF THE WILL. I GUESS THE POLICE THOUGHT THAT WAS MOTIVE. THE DETECTIVES WENT AND PICKED UP MY BROTHER AND DROVE HIM TO THE PRECINCT. THEY TRIED TO START INTIMIDATING HIM AND TELLING HIM, "WE KNOW YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOUR FATHER'S MURDER." WE CAN'T HELP YOU OUT, JIMMY, UNLESS YOU'RE STRAIGHT WITH US. WHAT HAPPENED? I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T KILL MY FATHER. "JUST TELL US THE TRUTH, AND WE'LL, YOU KNOW, MAKE IT EASIER ON YOU. YOU JUST NEED TO COME CLEAN, AND WE KNOW YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT." WE GOT ENOUGH RIGHT NOW TO LOCK YOU UP. YOUR POPS TOOK YOU OFF ALL HIS BANK ACCOUNTS. HE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE YOU OUT OF HIS WILL! THAT'S A MOTIVE. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TALKING TO ME. YOU SHOULD TALK TO MY SISTER'S BOYFRIEND. THEY PICK UP ROB AND THEY BRING HIM TO THE HEADQUARTERS. THEY WALK HIM PAST MY BROTHER, JIMMY, JUST TO LET HIM KNOW THAT THEY HAVE JIMMY THERE, AND THEY SIT HIM IN ANOTHER ROOM. SO, MR. PIERSON WAS TOO STRICT FOR YOU? NOT GIVING YOU THE TIME YOU WANTED WITH HIS DAUGHTER. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, ROB WAS NEVER A FAN OF MY FATHER. ROB WAS ALLOWED OVER AS LONG AS WE STAYED AND WATCHED TV ON THE COUCH AND MY FATHER WAS IN THE ROOM. WE WEREN'T REALLY EVER ALLOWED OUT OF UNDER HIS EYE. WE ALWAYS HAD TO BE AROUND HIM SO HE COULD SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. ONE DAY, HE ALLOWED US TO GO TO A MOVIE. OH, HE'S GETTING OUT. I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY! WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO THE MOVIES, AND WE GOT PULLED OVER BY A COP. -HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. -THANK YOU. YOU, TOO. -PRETTY FUNNY, WASN'T IT? -IT WAS GOOD. GO TO YOUR ROOM. ROB. HOW CAN I LET YOU DATE MY DAUGHTER IF YOU DRIVE RECKLESSLY WHEN SHE'S WITH YOU? I CAN'T ALLOW HER IN YOUR CAR IF YOU BREAK THE LAW. AND THE REASON HE KNEW THAT WAS BECAUSE HE DECIDED TO TAKE MY SISTER AND FOLLOW US TO THE MOVE THEATER. THAT TYPE OF OVERPROTECTIVE FATHER CAN DRIVE A GUY CRAZY. YOU'RE WAY OFF THE MARK, OKAY? YOU'RE MISSING THE WHOLE POINT. CHERYL. CHERYL! GET DRESSED AND COME OUT HERE. THE POLICE WANT TO TALK TO YOU. HELLO AGAIN, CHERYL. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO TELL YOUR GRANDMOTHER? NO. I ALMOST STARTED TO CRY BECAUSE THAT WAS MY BIGGEST FEAR, WAS THAT PEOPLE WOULD KNOW. IT'S OKAY, CHERYL. THEY KNOW EVERYTHING. AFTER MY BOYFRIEND, ROB, HAD BEEN QUESTIONED BY THE DETECTIVES, THEY BROUGHT HIM BACK TO MY HOUSE. IT'S OKAY, CHERYL. THEY KNOW EVERYTHING. MA'AM, WE BELIEVE YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER WAS INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF YOUR SON. WHAT? MY GRANDMOTHER COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THIS MUST BE SOME MISTAKE. OKAY? CHERYL, TELL THEM. CHERYL, TELL THEM! CHERYL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME WITH ME, PLEASE. OKAY, OKAY, CHERYL! SPEAK UP, CAN YOU JUST TELL ME SOME... -MA'AM. MA'AM. -JUST... NO! JUST WAIT A SECOND. TELL THEM IT'S NOT TRUE. CHERYL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME WITH ME. TELL -- CHERYL! MY GRANDMOTHER SCREAMED OR CRIED OUT, LIKE, LOUD, JUST CRYING HYSTERICAL. THE DETECTIVES JUST TOOK ME AND ROB AND WALKED US OUT OF THE HOUSE AND BROUGHT US TO THE PRECINCT. I WAS VERY QUIET IN THE CAR RIDE, AND SO WAS ROB. WE WERE BOTH VERY NERVOUS. THEY PUT ME IN A SEPARATE ROOM. I NEVER GOT TO SEE ROB OR MY BROTHER. I HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH ROB HAD TOLD THE POLICE. CHERYL, WHY DID YOU DO IT? ROB TOLD US WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR FATHER. IN ORDER FOR US TO HELP, WE HAVE TO HEAR IT FROM YOUR SIDE. I JUST REMEMBER SITTING THERE, THINKING TO MYSELF, "OKAY, I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ANYBODY, AND NOW I'M TELLING THIS STRANGE MAN, AND HE ASKING ME DETAILS." SO JUST START FROM THE BEGINNING. TELL US THE WHOLE STORY AS YOU REMEMBER. I WAS 11 WHEN IT REALLY STARTED. WHEN MY MOTHER GOT SICK, I HAD TO TAKE ON MORE OF HER ROLE AT HOME. I STILL WAS GOING TO SCHOOL AND COMING HOME AT, LIKE, 3:00 OR 4:00 AND THEN, JUST HAVING TO START HOMEWORK, DINNER. I COULDN'T HAVE, LIKE, A NORMAL KID LIFE. MY FATHER WAS VERY STRICT, AND HE LIKED EVERYTHING IN ORDER. OUR HOUSE WAS IMMACULATE AND THAT'S THE WAY I HAD TO KEEP IT. IT WAS A LOT OF WORK AND UPKEEP. WHEN MY FATHER, YOU KNOW, STARTED HANGING OUT WITH ME MORE, I WELCOMED THE ATTENTION. I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. I SAID, "FINALLY, SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW, CARES ABOUT ME AND WANTS TO SPEND TIME WITH ME." MY MOM WAS IN AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL, AND SHE WASN'T HOME MUCH. HE WOULD MAKE ME WATCH TV WITH HIM IN HIS BEDROOM. SO I WATCHED THE YANKEES WITH HIM. MY BROTHER DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH HIM ANYMORE. FOR NOW, I WAS GONNA SPEND TIME WITH HIM AND WATCH SOMETHING THAT HE LIKED TO WATCH. HE WOULD HAVE ME LAY NEXT TO HIM AND HAVE HIS ARM WRAPPED AROUND ME. AND HE WOULD GO FROM RUBBING MY BACK TO RUBBING MY BUTT, TILL ONE DAY HE WAS, LIKE, TOUCHING MY BREAST. RELAX, WOULD YOU? QUIT SQUIRMING. ENJOY YOURSELF FOR ONCE. IF YOU DIDN'T LET HIM DO WHAT HE WANTED TO DO, THEN IT GOT TO BE VIOLENT. ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE MY MOM DIED, IT WAS VALENTINE'S DAY, AND MY DAD DROVE ME TO SCHOOL THAT MORNING. SO WHICH BOY IS YOUR SECRET VALENTINE? YOU GETTING SOMETHING SPECIAL TODAY? NO, DADDY, THERE'S -- THERE'S NO BOY. NO VALENTINE. NOTHING. GOODBYE. WHAT IS THIS? STAY IN HERE! SHUT THE DAMN DOOR! DON'T YOU EVER LIE TO ME YOU LITTLE... HE WOULD LITERALLY BEAT ME TO A PULP THAT DAY. MY UPPER CHEST AND MY FACE AND THE SIDE OF MY FACE WAS UNRECOGNIZABLE. IT JUST GOT WORSE FROM THERE. HOW'D IT GET WORSE? I WAS AROUND 13. CHERYL, YOU WANT TO COME OVER HERE AND GIVE ME A HAND? HE CALLED ME INTO THAT HALL AND HE SAID HE NEEDED SOMETHING UP HIGH ON THE LADDER. HE PUT THE LADDER UNDERNEATH THE ATTIC. WANT TO CLIMB UP THERE AND GET THAT BOX? AND I HAD A PAIR OF SHORTS ON. I REMEMBER I HAD A PAIR OF SHORTS ON. AND I GOT UP ON THE LADDER... AND HE JUST PULLED MY PANTS DOWN. THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE JUST PULLED HIS PANTS DOWN AND STEPPED UP ON THE LADDER. I WANTED TO SCREAM. I WANTED TO SAY "STOP," BUT I... WHEN YOU SAY IT OUT LOUD, IT'S, LIKE, IT'S TRUE. YOU'RE VALIDATING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING OUT LOUD, SO ALL THESE YEARS, I COULD PRETEND IT WASN'T ME. WELL, NOW I'M -- NOW I'M SAYING IT'S ME. I WANTED TO DIE. I WANTED GOD TO KILL ME. HOW OFTEN DID THIS HAPPEN? LOTS. EVERY DAY. FOR 3 YEARS. AND AFTER THAT IT JUST GOT MORE FREQUENT AND WORSE EACH TIME, SO... I HATED MY FATHER, BUT THAT'S NOT THE REASON WHY. THE REASON WHY WHAT? WHY I WANTED HIM TO JUST...DISAPPEAR. AND THEN, MY WORST FEARS CAME TRUE. ONE NIGHT, HE ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, SAID THAT ROB AND I COULD GO OUT. ROB AND I HAD A GOOD TIME, BUT WE WERE SO NERVOUS TO BE OUT TOGETHER, I WAS BACK HOME BY 9:00. THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS VERY DARK AND I THOUGHT, "THAT WAS ODD, WHY WAS THE HOUSE DARK?" I SAW THE TV GLARING FROM THE END OF THE HALL, AND... THAT'S RIGHT, HONEY. YOU JUST KEEP GOING OUT. KEEP GOING OUT. I JUST PANICKED BECAUSE I KNEW THAT THAT'S HOW IT HAD STARTED WITH ME, WATCHING TV. I DID HIRE SOMEONE TO KILL MY FATHER SO THAT THE ABUSE WOULD STOP AND IT WOULD NOT CONTINUE ONTO MY SISTER AS WELL. HAD YOUR FATHER DONE SOMETHING TO JOANNE? I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO HER. AND THAT MORNING I QUESTIONED MY SISTER WHEN I GOT HER UP FOR SCHOOL. I SAID, "YOU WERE WATCHING TV WITH DADDY LAST NIGHT?" AND SHE SAID "YEAH." AND I JUST TRIED TO QUESTION HER, JUST TO SEE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, IS EVERYTHING OKAY, DID HE RUB YOUR BACK, LIKE, YOU KNOW, HE RUBS MY BACK. AND SHE SAID "NO." SHE SAID NO TO EVERYTHING. I HAD PROMISED MY MOTHER THAT I WOULD PROTECT HER AND TAKE CARE OF HER. AFTER 6 YEARS OF SUFFERING FROM A RARE KIDNEY DISEASE, MY MOTHER DIED ON FEBRUARY 13, 1985. IT REALLY WAS BOTHERING ME THAT I NEEDED TO SPEAK TO MY MOTHER FOR ONE LAST TIME. I WAITED FOR SOME ALONE TIME. AND I WENT UP TO THE CASKET. I TOUCHED HER HAND. I SAID, "MOM, I'M REALLY SORRY. I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL ALWAYS PROTECT JOANNE, AND I WILL NEVER LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HER." NOW THAT I HAD TOLD THE POLICE WHAT MY FATHER HAD DONE TO ME, THEY WANTED TO KNOW THE DETAILS OF HIS MURDER. YOU KILLED YOUR FATHER, DIDN'T YOU? OKAY, THEN WHO DID? ONE NIGHT, WE'RE EATING DINNER, AND THE NEWS WAS ON. A STORY ABOUT A WOMAN NAMED BEVERLY WALLACE. SHE WAS ARRESTED FOR HIRING A HITMAN TO KILL HER HUSBAND BECAUSE HE WAS MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY ABUSING HER. SO I'M LISTENING TO THIS, AND THINKING THAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA. YOU LIKE THE CHICKEN, HONEY? YOUR SISTER'S A GOOD COOK, JUST LIKE MOMMY. IF SOMEONE WOULD DO THAT FOR ME, THEN MY FATHER WOULD BE GONE FOREVER, AND HE COULD NEVER HURT ME AND MY SISTER EVER AGAIN. WE NEED DETAILS. YOU'RE LOOKING AT 25 YEARS TO LIFE. I COULDN'T GET IT OFF MY MIND. I WAS CONSTANTLY THINKING ABOUT IT. SO THEN, THE NEXT DAY, I WENT INTO HOME ROOM. YOU GUYS HEAR ABOUT THE BEVERLY WALLACE MURDER ON THE NEWS LAST NIGHT? YEAH, I SEEN THAT, ACTUALLY. WHO WOULD BE CRAZY ENOUGH TO KILL SOMEBODY FOR MONEY? I WOULD. WHEN THE INVESTIGATORS ASKED ME WHO I HIRED TO KILL MY FATHER, I TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS SEAN PICO. SO WHAT ARE YOU CHARGING FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? I DON'T KNOW. THOUSAND DOLLARS. A THOUSAND BUCKS? REALLY? $1,000 -- MY FATHER KEEPS $1,000 IN HIS FRONT POCKET. $1,000, TO ME, DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT OF MONEY. HEY, UH... WERE YOU SERIOUS? SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT? NEVERMIND. WHAT, ABOUT THE MONEY? YEAH. YEAH, YEAH. $1,000. YEAH. I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WOULD PAY YOU TO DO THAT. WHO? ME. WHO WOULDN'T PAY $1,000 TO HAVE YOUR LOVED ONE SAFE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE? AFTER I TOLD THE POLICE ABOUT SEAN, THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHO ELSE WAS INVOLVED. WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR TWO YEARS, CHERYL. WHEN ARE WE GONNA SLEEP TOGETHER? WHAT? YOU'RE JUST GONNA SAY IT LIKE THAT? -WELL, IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS! -YOU'RE PRESSURING ME. I DON'T APPRECIATE BEING PRESSURED. WHEN MY FATHER WAS TRYING TO HAVE SEX WITH ME, I COULD TURN MYSELF OFF AND PUT MYSELF SOMEPLACE ELSE. I WAS HAVING THAT SAME REACTION WHEN ROB WAS TRYING TO, EXCEPT ROB WOULDN'T FORCE HIMSELF ON ME. I KNOW YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH YOUR FATHER. WHAT? YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YEAH? YEAH, THE WAY HE TOUCHES YOU, THE WAY HE TREATS YOU, THE WAY HE -- HE -- HE REACTS WHEN I TOUCH YOU? I MEAN, IT'S NOT RIGHT. I AM THE LUCKIEST FATHER IN THE WORLD. THE MORE TIME HE SPENT IN THE HOUSE WITH US, THE MORE POSSESSIVE MY FATHER GOT, THE MORE ROB FIGURED IT OUT. GOD, IT'S TRUE. THEN, WHEN I ADMITTED IT, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION. HE WAS JUST LIKE, NOW WHAT DO I DO?" LIKE, I JUST WANTED HIM TO KNOW THAT THE REASON WHY IT WAS HAPPENING IS NOT BECAUSE I WANTED IT TO, IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD TO. I HAD NO CHOICE. I JUST DON'T WANT HIM TO HURT JOANNE. I TOLD ROB THAT I SPOKE TO SEAN. AND HE SAID, THERE'S NO WAY THIS KID'S GONNA DO IT." HE TOLD ROB THAT HE WAS DEFINITELY GONNA DO IT, AND HE WAS GONNA STAB HIM. AND ROB SAID, "ABSOLUTELY NOT. THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU'RE GONNA STAB HIM." HE'S LIKE, "YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO THIS. JUST FORGET IT." AND THEN WE LEFT IT AT THAT. B-E-A-T! COME ON WOLVES, BEAT THE COUGARS! -YEAH! -WHOO! YEAH! ALL RIGHT, GIRLS, THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD. UH, WE STILL NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE PRACTICE BUT NEXT WEEK WE'LL DO IT, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. HEY, HEY. I'M GONNA DO IT. I'M STILL GONNA DO IT. UH, OKAY, SURE. ALLS I WAS THINKING OF WAS THAT I WANTED MY FATHER TO STOP AND TO GO AWAY. I DIDN'T REALIZE AT THE POINT OF 16 THAT IT WAS MURDER. WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW BACK THEN WHEN MY FATHER WAS MURDERED THAT I KNOW NOW IS THAT, SEAN HAD STOOD BEHIND A BIG OAK TREE IN THE FRONT OF OUR YARD HOLDING A .22 CALIBER GUN. IT WAS VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING. MOST PEOPLE WERE STILL SLEEPING, AND NOBODY HEARD THE GUN. HE WAITED UNTIL MY FATHER WALKED OUT TO GO TO WORK AND SHOT HIM ONCE. HE WENT DOWN AND THEN SEAN RAN UP TO HIM AND SHOT FOUR MORE BULLETS INTO MY FATHER TO MAKE SURE THAT HE WAS DEAD. THE POLICE BELIEVED MY STORY... ...BUT NOT EVERYONE ELSE DID. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS WORSE, TELLING PEOPLE THE TRUTH OR HAVING THEM NOT BELIEVE THE TRUTH. THE MEDIA, RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, WAS RUTHLESS. CHERYL, CHERYL! WHY DID YOU KILL HIM, CHERYL? ARE YOU DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL, CHERYL? WHY'D YOU KILL YOUR FATHER, CHERYL? I COULDN'T GO OUT IN THE PUBLIC ANY MORE. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD? DID YOU DO IT FOR THE MONEY, CHERYL? ONE STATEMENT. RIGHT HERE, CHERYL, TAKE A PICTURE. DID YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR MOTHER? YOU'RE ASKING A 16-YEAR-OLD KID THAT'S, YOU KNOW, CLEARLY UPSET. WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE OKAY TO SHOUT THAT OUT? TESTIFYING AT MY TRIAL WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS BECAUSE I HAD TO ADMIT IN FRONT OF A WHOLE ROOM FULL OF STRANGERS WHAT HAD HAPPENED. HE WAS A GOOD, HONEST MAN. HE WOULD NEVER DO THIS TO HIS DAUGHTER. I HAD ALREADY PLEAD GUILTY, SO THE TRIAL WAS JUST FOR THE JUDGE TO GIVE ME MY SENTENCE, WHICH COULD BE ANYTHING FROM PROBATION TO LIFE. WE'D LIKE TO CALL VIRGINIA PIERSON TO THE STAND. MY GRANDMOTHER KNEW ME. MY AUNT KNEW ME. I WAS A GOOD KID, I GOT GOOD GRADES. I TOOK CARE OF MY SISTER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE THINKING THAT I WAS LYING. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SAY THAT SOMEBODY WAS DOING THAT TO YOU? THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO BRAG ABOUT. I KNOW MY OWN SON. HE WOULD NEVER TOUCH HIS DAUGHTER LIKE THAT. NEVER. HE WAS A GOOD MAN. AND HE DESERVED A LOT BETTER THAN HE GOT. DURING THE TRIAL I WAS OUT ON BAIL, BUT THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD STAY WITH MY AUNT AND GRANDMOTHER. THANKFULLY, BIG MIKE AND BERTIE, OUR NEIGHBORS, TOOK ME IN BUT JOANNE WOULDN'T COME. MY AUNT AND GRANDMOTHER BRAINWASHED HER TO THE POINT SO BAD THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF ME. SHE WROTE THE LETTER TO THE JUDGE STATING THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT MY FATHER WAS A GREAT GUY. DEAR JUDGE SHERMAN, THE REASON I'M WRITING YOU IS TO LET YOU KNOW THE TRUTH AND NOT LIES. SOMETIMES, WE WOULD WATCH TV IN MY FATHER'S ROOM. SOMETIMES WE WOULD FALL ASLEEP IN MY FATHER'S BED. I SAW MY SISTER ALWAYS LAYING ALL OVER MY FATHER, AND SOMETIMES SHE WOULD SAY, "OH, DAD, I LOVE YOU." AND START HUGGING HIM. AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS HURTFUL, I KNEW FROM SO MANY YEARS OF SURVIVAL THAT YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO LIVE WHERE YOU HAVE TO LIVE. NOT EVERYONE TESTIFIED AGAINST ME. SOME PEOPLE SPOKE OUT FOR ME TO HELP REDUCE MY SENTENCE. CHERYL WAS IN HER CAR WITH HER FATHER, GETTING DROPPED OFF. I HAD A CLASSMATE WHO TESTIFIED. I SAW HIM PULL HER BACK INTO THE CAR. GET BACK IN HERE! DON'T YOU EVER LIE TO ME! AND START PUNCHING HER -- IN THE FACE. SHE, YOU KNOW, WENT TO HER PARENTS AND HER PARENTS TOLD HER THAT SHE NEEDED TO GO TO THE, YOU KNOW, SCHOOL COUNSELOR. AND THE COUNSELOR TOLD HER, "I'M SORRY. THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO UNLESS CHERYL TO US AND TELLS US HERSELF." YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DID NOTICE THINGS. I WAS A CHEERLEADER AND I WORE SKIRTS, YOU KNOW, AND YOU COULD SEE MY LEGS WERE ALL BRUISED. NONE OF THE TEACHERS SAID ANYTHING. NONE OF MY FRIENDS' PARENTS SAID ANYTHING. INCEST IS THE MOST SHAMEFUL, EMBARRASSING, DISGUSTING THING THAT I THINK ANYBODY COULD EVER GO THROUGH. IT'S A SECRET THAT NOBODY TALKS ABOUT, AND PEOPLE ARE JUST EVEN EMBARRASSED TO THINK THAT THEY THINK SOMETHING'S GOING ON. THE WITNESSES THAT TESTIFIED ON MY BEHALF, HAD TOLD FAMILY STORIES THAT I HAD NEVER HEARD OF. MICHAEL CASSLER TO THE STAND. AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WERE SAYING WAS VERY SHOCKING. BIG MIKE TESTIFIED THAT MY GRANDFATHER CAME TO HIM ONE AFTERNOON. HE CAME TO MY HOUSE. HE WAS PRETTY SHAKEN UP. HE TOLD ME THAT HE THOUGHT HE HAD JUST WALKED IN ON JAMES IN BED WITH CHERYL, DOING SOMETHING VERY INAPPROPRIATE, AND I WAS THE ONE THAT TALKED HIM OUT OF BELIEVING WHAT HE SAW. I JUST DIDN'T -- I THOUGHT I KNEW JAMES. WELL, THE DAY OF THE SENTENCING I REALLY WAS IN A FOG. JUDGE WAS TRYING TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF ME. MISS PIERSON, CAN YOU PLEASE STAND. I WAS, YOU KNOW, REALLY NERVOUS AND DIDN'T FEEL WELL AND FELT LIKE THE ROOM STARTED SPINNING AND I -- MY HEART WAS POUNDING. I COULDN'T BREATHE, AND I JUST... THEY WERE RUSHING ME OUT OF THE COURTROOM, AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE SENTENCING WAS. ALLS I REMEMBER SAYING WAS THAT, "CAN I SAY GOODBYE TO MY FAMILY" AND THEY SAID NO. AND THEN THEY JUST SWEPT ME OUT AND BROUGHT ME STRAIGHT TO JAIL. THE SENTENCE WAS 5 YEARS PROBATION AND 6 MONTHS INCARCERATED. WHEN I CAME OUT OF JAIL ON JANUARY 19, 1988 -- I KNOW THAT DATE. OKAY, I'M JUST GLAD IT'S OVER, YOU KNOW? ROB PICKED ME UP IN A WHITE STRETCH LIMOUSINE WITH MY BROTHER. IT WAS THE BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD, TO KNOW THAT MY LIFE WAS JUST BEGINNING NOW. THIRTY YEARS HAVE PASSED AND DO I HAVE REGRETS? THAT'S A HARD QUESTION. I DO REGRET, SOMETIMES, NOT BEING ABLE TO TRUST SOMEBODY ENOUGH TO TELL THEM, BUT HOW COULD I TRUST ANYBODY WHEN THE PERSON THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO TRUST THE MOST... WAS RAPING ME ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS EVERY DAY? WHO WAS I SUPPOSED TO TRUST? SO DO I REGRET IT HAPPENING? SOME DAYS I DO, BUT MOST DAYS, I'M JUST GLAD THAT HE -- THAT HE'S GONE AND THAT HE'LL NEVER HURT ME AGAIN. THROUGH IT ALL, THE ONLY PERSON I COULD TRUST WAS ROB. THE DAY I GOT OUT OF JAIL, HE GOT DOWN ON HIS KNEE AND ASKED IF I WOULD MAKE HIM THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE WORLD AND BE HIS WIFE. AND I ABSOLUTELY SAID YES. THIS OCTOBER WE WILL BE MARRIED 28 YEARS. AS LONG AS WE WERE TOGETHER, WE COULD GET THROUGH ANYTHING. I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORTED ME. AND, UM...IT WAS ROUGH, BUT I MADE IT. AND THANK YOU.
