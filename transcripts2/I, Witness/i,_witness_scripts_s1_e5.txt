I KNOW. WE REALLY SHOULD. LET'S MAKE IT A WEEKLY THING. OKAY, YEAH. RIGHT, RIGHT? YEAH. IT DESTROYS, TO SOME EXTENT, YOUR FEELINGS AND YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT'S SAFE. YOU AND ME, A BURGER, A BEER OR TWO... OKAY. MAYBE THREE, MAYBE THREE.

 CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS YUMA HAD IT'S SHARE OF CRIME. AND WE -- WE WOULD HAVE MAYBE A SPREE OF GAS STATION ROBBERIES OR CORNER STORE TYPE ROBBERIES. BUT YOU JUST DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF MURDERS IN YUMA. I CAME TO POLICE WORK LATER IN LIFE. I DID 20 YEARS IN THE MARINE CORPS. IT WAS GOOD TO ME. I WAS GOOD TO THEM. BUT, AT 40 YEARS OLD, I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO DO SOMETHIN' ELSE. YUMA CITY POLICE WERE LOOKIN' FOR OFFICERS. I DID PROPERTY CRIME FOR A YEAR. BUT I WANTED TO DO HOMICIDE. IT WAS EXCITING. AND I REALLY WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE. DIAMONDBACKS -- MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL IN ARIZONA NEXT YEAR! DETECTIVE BRYAN ROGERS WAS MY SENIOR. HE HAD SEEN IT ALL. AND I HAD A LOT TO LEARN FROM HIM. WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME, WAYNE? VICTIM'S KENNETH CLOUD. SEEMS SHOT TO THE NECK. THE AMBULANCE SAYS HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT. WIFE WAS WITH HIM WHEN IT HAPPENED. SHE'S IN THE RESTAURANT. KAY CLOUD WAS PRETTY SHAKEN UP. SO THE PARAMEDICS HAD GIVEN HER A SEDATIVE TO CALM HER NERVES. BY THE TIME WE ARRIVED AT THE SCENE, KEN CLOUD HAD ALREADY BEEN TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL. BUT HE DIDN'T SURVIVE. HERE'S MY POLAROIDS. THIS OFFICER HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO GET HIS CAMERA THAT THEY GAVE YOU AND ACTUALLY REACH IN OVER THE MEDICS AND TAKEN PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE VICTIM WHILE HE WAS IN THERE. KENNETH CLOUD WAS SLUMPED OVER THE SEAT IN A POOL OF BLOOD. AND BLOOD WAS EVERYWHERE. HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE LEFT SIDE OF THE NECK AT ABOUT THIS ANGLE, CUT HIS CAROTID, THROUGH HIS WINDPIPE AND COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE. HE BASICALLY DROWNED IN HIS OWN BLOOD. THE GUNSHOT RESIDUE ON THE DRIVER'S WINDOW INDICATED, IN THIS CASE, THAT THE SHOOTER WAS WITHIN 1 TO 2 FEET, VERY CLOSE. THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THERE WAS A ROBBERY. AND THERE WAS NO MURDER WEAPON FOUND. OUR ASSUMPTION WAS IT WAS AN EXECUTION. GOT A WITNESS OVER HERE ON THE BIKE. AT THE SCENE OF THE SHOOTING, A TEENAGER WAS IDENTIFIED. THIS THE WITNESS? SO, YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED? YEAH. HE HAD BEEN CUTTING THROUGH THE PARKING LOT AT BURGERS & BEER. AND, INITIALLY, HE THOUGHT SOMEONE WAS BREAKING IN THE VEHICLE AND IT WAS THE WINDOW SHATTERING. HE DESCRIBED HIM AS A HISPANIC MALE, KINDA HEAVYSET, 35, 40 YEARS OLD. AND HE THOUGHT HE WAS TUCKING SOMETHING INTO HIS PANTS. THERE WAS ANOTHER WITNESS -- KEN'S WIFE, KAY CLOUD. SHE WAS STILL INSIDE THE RESTAURANT. KAY CLOUD HAD AN INJURY TO HER LIP. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTED THAT THE BULLET SEPARATED, HIT THE DASH AND THEN DEFLECTED, HITTING KAY CLOUD IN THE LIP. I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE UPSET. BUT WE NEED TO GET THROUGH THIS WHILE IT'S ALL FRESH. CAN YOU JUST TELL US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU LEFT THE RESTAURANT? WE, UH, WE WENT OUT INTO THE PARKING LOT. KEN PUT HIS ARM AROUND ME. WE KISSED AT THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. AND I WALKED OVER TO MY SIDE. I OPENED MY DOOR. AND I -- I HEARD A POP. SOMETHING HIT MY LIP. I LOOKED OVER AT KEN. AND HE HAD FALLEN BACK. AND THERE WAS BLOOD POURING OUT OF HIM. I JUST STARTED SCREAMING. AND I RAN BACK INTO THE RESTAURANT. SOME PEOPLE CALLED 911. BEFORE I WAS INVOLVED IN THIS CASE, I DIDN'T KNOW WHO KENNETH CLOUD WAS. I KNEW HE WAS A FARMER. CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT KEN, WHAT THE TWO OF YOU DID TODAY? WAS THIS A NORMAL DAY? KEN AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 15 YEARS. WE FOUND EACH OTHER LATER IN LIFE. KENNETH WAS 55 YEARS OLD, WHAT I WOULD CALL A GENTLEMAN FARMER. HE HAD FAMILY IN THE AREA, A BROTHER, JOHNNY, AND A SISTER, NORMA. AND THE THREE OF THEM WERE VERY CLOSE. OVER THE YEARS, HE'D PICKED UP FARMLAND TO WHERE HE HAD A COUPLE HUNDRED ACRES. YOU KNOW, HE WASN'T GROWIN' A WHOLE BUNCH OF CROPS. HE BASICALLY RENTED HIS LAND. IT WAS A LUCRATIVE BUSINESS. KENNETH CLOUD WAS MAKING $150,000 TO $200,000 A YEAR. AND THAT WAS IN 1997. KENNETH CLOUD'S ASSETS COME UP TO PROBABLY A COUPLE MILLION BUCKS FOR THE LAND. I MEAN, HE'S RICH. HE'S A MILLIONAIRE. BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT. ALL RIGHT. ONE, TWO, THREE. CHEESE! SO, THE TWO OF YOU WERE PRETTY WELL OFF. YOU COULD SAY THAT. WE LIVE VERY MODESTLY. ANYBODY EVER THREATEN KEN, BUSINESS DEAL GONE BAD? WELL, HE DIDN'T DO SO WELL FOR HIMSELF WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO SQUEEZE A NICKEL. THAT RUBBED SOME PEOPLE THE WRONG WAY. LIKE WHO? THERE WAS A TENANT, A JIMMY. HE AND KEN WENT AT IT PRETTY BAD IN OCTOBER. JIMMY EVER THREATEN KEN? HE SURE DID. I MEAN, I WASN'T THERE. BUT KEN CAME HOME MAD AS HELL. WHAT'S THIS JIMMY LOOK LIKE? LOOKS MEXICAN, IN HIS 30's, MAYBE. TALL? SIX FOOT, MAYBE. KAY CLOUD'S DESCRIPTION OF JIMMY MATCHED WHAT WE HAD JUST HEARD FROM THE EYEWITNESS. WE NEEDED TO GO TALK TO JIMMY. A FEW WEEKS BEFORE KEN CLOUD WAS MURDERED, HE GOT INTO A BAD ARGUMENT WITH ONE OF HIS TENANTS. WE KNEW JIMMY HAD A COUPLE ARRESTS FOR ROBBERIES. AND THERE WAS ALSO AN INCIDENT WHERE SOMEONE IN THE FAMILY HAD BEEN FIRING A WEAPON AROUND THE RESIDENCE. JIMMY? I'M DETECTIVE ROGERS. THIS IS DETECTIVE MARTIN. YOU WERE A TENANT OF KEN CLOUD FOR QUITE SOME TIME, WEREN'T YOU? THAT CHEAP SON OF A BITCH WANTED TO KICK US OUT ON THE STREET. YOU ASK ME, AIN'T NOBODY GONNA MISS HIM. JIMMY ADMITTED HE HAD A PROBLEM WITH KENNY, THAT THEY HAD AN ARGUMENT. JIMMY THOUGHT KENNY WAS CHEAP, CHARGED TOO MUCH, WASN'T FIXIN' THE PLACE UP AND ULTIMATELY, BECAUSE OF THE WEAPONS INCIDENT, KENNY EVICTED JIMMY'S FAMILY FROM THE PROPERTY. SO, WHERE WERE YOU THE NIGHT KEN CLOUD GOT SHOT? I WAS ON A DELIVERY AT THE CIRCLE K OVER IN GILA BEND. THE MANAGER'S BRENT. CALL HIM. YOU NEED TO WATCH YOUR STEP. WE'RE GONNA BE WATCHIN' YOU. YOU UNDERSTAND? WE WENT BACK TO THE STATION TO CHECK OUT JIMMY'S ALIBI. HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN JIMMY? SO, YOU'RE SURE IT WAS HIM. AND YOU'RE SURE -IT WAS ON THE 9 -TH? JIMMY'S ALIBI WAS VERIFIED. HE WAS AT WORK WHEN KEN CLOUD WAS KILLED. ALL RIGHT. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. SO, THERE GOES OUR ONE SUSPECT. THE MURDER OF KENNETH CLOUD WAS A BIG DEAL. A LOT OF NEWS COVERAGE. AND THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SCENE BY THE BICYCLIST WAS PUT OUT. AND IT WAS IN THE PAPER. IT WAS ON TV. ARE YOU DETECTIVE MARTIN? HOW CAN I HELP YOU? I'M A FRIEND OF KAY CLOUD'S. I THINK I HAVE INFORMATION REGARDING KEN CLOUD'S MURDER. THIS IS DETECTIVE ROGERS. PLEASED TO MEET YOU, MA'AM. LET ME GET YOU A CHAIR. SHE KNOWS THE PERSON BASED ON THE DESCRIPTION THAT WAS PUT IN THE PAPER THAT SHE BELIEVED WAS POSSIBLY INVOLVED IN THIS. SHE STATED THAT HE ARRIVED IN YUMA A COUPLE YEARS AGO. HE CLAIMED THAT HE WAS WORTH $35 MILLION. AND HE WANTED A BANK. SHE INTRODUCED HIM TO KAY CLOUD, WHO WORKED AT BANK ONE IN YUMA. HOW CAN I HELP YOU TODAY? HE HAD INVESTMENT PAPERWORK FROM AN INVESTMENT COMPANY INDICATING THAT HE WAS WORTH ALL THIS MONEY. THAT WAS GIVEN TO KAY CLOUD. THANK YOU. THEY TOLD ME THAT YOU'RE THE PERSON THAT CAN HELP ME. SHE IDENTIFIED HIM AS VINCENT ACARDO. IT WAS LOVELY TO MEET YOU. I'LL BE IN TOUCH IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. I WILL WAIT FOR YOUR CALL. KATE CLOUD HAD SENT THAT TO PHOENIX, TO THE MAIN BANK. AND THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE PAPERWORK WAS FRAUDULENT. WHEN THE BANK FOUND OUT HIS DOCUMENTATION WAS FRAUDULENT, VINCENT ACARDO DISAPPEARED. THIS IS OFFICER WAYNE BOYD, POLICE DEPARTMENT -- WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR A MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE STAYED WITH YOU RECENTLY. IT SEEMED LIKE A LONG SHOT. BUT IT WAS THE ONLY LEAD WE HAD. SO WE LOOKED INTO ACARDO'S BACKGROUND HOPING TO FIND ANYTHING AT ALL THAT MIGHT CONNECT HIM TO THE MURDER. KICKED OUT OF THE MARINES IN '83. THERE'S A PHOTO OF HIM IN BOOT. THAT'S GOOD. VINCENT ACARDO DID HAVE A CRIMINAL HISTORY. HE HAD A HISTORY OF AN ARMED ROBBERY, SOME FRAUDS AND -- AND THEFTS. BUT HE HAD BEEN SMART ENOUGH ALL THESE YEARS TO KEEP HIS NAME OFF ANY TYPE OF RECORD THAT CAN BE TRACKED. ALL HIS DOCUMENTS WERE BOGUS. HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. HE WAS HERE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HERE? WHERE'S HERE? RIGHT HERE IN YUMA, THE TRAVEL LODGE. VINCENT ACARDO HAD STAYED AT THE TRAVEL LODGE IN YUMA ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER. GOOD JOB, WAYNE. THANK YOU, SIR. WE WENT TO THE TRAVEL LODGE TO INVESTIGATE. LET'S GO. HEY, TAKE A LOOK. FROM VINCENT ACARDO'S ROOM AT THE TRAVEL LODGE, YOU COULD LOOK STRAIGHT ACROSS THE POOL AND SEE THE CRIME SCENE. HE WAS WATCHIN' FROM RIGHT HERE. FROM HIS ROOM AT THE TRAVEL LODGE, VINCENT ACARDO HAD A CLEAR VIEW OF THE SCENE OF KEN CLOUD'S MURDER. CAN WE SEE THAT REGISTER RECEIPT NOW? ON THE RECEIPT, THERE WAS ANOTHER RECORD. THERE WERE PHONE CALLS MADE TO THE MOTEL 6 ON ARIZONA AVENUE IN YUMA. AND IT'S, LIKE, OKAY, WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? WHO'S AT THE MOTEL 6? WE GET TO THE MOTEL 6. WE SPEAK TO THE CLERK. WE ASK HIM WHO RENTED THE ROOM THAT DAY. THEY PULL OUT THEIR DOCUMENTS. AND IT WAS RENTED TO A WOMAN CALLED BETTY HOWERTON. OKAY, SO WHO'S BETTY HOWERTON? WELL, WE RAN THE LICENSE PLATE FROM THE VEHICLE THAT WAS LISTED ON THE MOTEL 6 RECEIPT. WE RAN THAT INFORMATION THROUGH THE CRIME COMPUTER. AND IT CAME BACK. THE CAR WAS REGISTERED TO LISA BAKER. AND WE LEARNED THAT BETTY HOWERTON IS LISA BAKER'S MOTHER. BASED ON THOSE PHONE CALLS, THEY'RE CONNECTED TO ACARDO. WHY WOULD HE CALL THEM? WHO ARE THEY TO HIM? COULD THEY HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLICES INVOLVED IN THE MURDER? ACARDO HAD A CRIMINAL PAST. SO HE KNEW HOW TO HIDE. AND HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. BUT, THROUGH THE CAR REGISTRATION, WE LEARNED THAT BETTY HOWERTON WAS LOCATED IN MCALLEN, TEXAS. WE MADE THE DECISION TO GO TO TEXAS TO INTERVIEW BETTY HOWERTON. WHAT IF SHE'S NOT ALONE? YOU GO TO A DIFFERENT STATE, YOU CAN'T TAKE YOUR GUN. YOU'RE OUT OF STATE, YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR JURISDICTION. AND YOU DON'T HAVE BACKUP. WE COULD'VE KNOCKED ON BETTY HOWERTON'S DOOR AND VINCENT ACARDO ANSWER THE DOOR. MISS HOWERTON? YES.. I'M DETECTIVE ROGERS. THIS IS DETECTIVE MARTIN, YUMA, ARIZONA POLICE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU HAVE TIME FOR A FEW QUESTIONS? I GUESS SO. WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH LISA BAKER? SHE'S MY DAUGHTER. WHAT'S HER RELATIONSHIP WITH VINCENT ACARDO? WELL, SHE'S PREGNANT BY HIM. LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY. I DON'T LIKE THE MAN. SHE SAID THEY WERE IN YUMA... CAN YOU LET ME GET THE DOOR? BECAUSE ACARDO TELLS LISA THAT HE HAS TO COME TO YUMA FOR BUSINESS. LISA DOESN'T REALLY TRUST HIM. SO SHE SAYS, "I'M GONNA GO WITH YOU." YOU OKAY, SWEETHEART? UH-HUH. BUT LISA'S PREGNANT. AND BETTY HOWERTON TELLS LISA, "I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO. YOU'RE PREGNANT. I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO ALL THAT WAY BY YOURSELF OR WITH HIM. 'CAUSE HE'S JUST GONNA LEAVE YOU IN A HOTEL LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES." BETTY HOWERTON AND LISA ARE IN THE HOTEL ROOM. AND THIS WENT ON FOR ABOUT A WEEK OR SO. AND THEN THEY LEFT YUMA. SO, WHERE ARE THEY NOW? WHO KNOWS? I DON'T KNOW. SHE'S WITH ACARDO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE MURDER OF KEN CLOUD? WHO? KEN CLOUD. I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW THAT NAME AT ALL. IT'S OBVIOUS SHE WAS LYING TO US. YOU CAN'T -- YOU CAN'T DO POLICE WORK WITHOUT KNOWING -- KNOWING WHEN PEOPLE'S LYIN' TO YOU. EVEN THOUGH WE THOUGHT SHE WAS LYING, WE DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY OR THE RESOURCES TO DO ANY KIND OF LONG-TERM, OUT-OF-STATE SURVEILLANCE ON BETTY HOWERTON. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, MA'AM. CERTAINLY. BYE. AT THIS POINT, WE WERE AT A DEAD END. WE WERE PRETTY SURE ACARDO WAS INVOLVED. BUT WE COULDN'T FIND HIM. AND, EVEN IF WE DID, WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE CONNECTING HIM TO THE MURDER. SO WE COULDN'T ARREST HIM. JOHNNY CLOUD IS THE VICTIM'S BROTHER. NORMA WAS HIS SISTER. AND THEY CAME IN, VERY NICE PEOPLE. DETECTIVE MARTIN? GOOD TO SEE YOU. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU COMIN' DOWN TODAY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO THANK US. AND I REALLY FELT BAD FOR THEM. I FELT BAD FOR THEIR FAMILY. THEY WANTED THE BROTHER'S MURDERER CAUGHT. HOW WERE THINGS WITH YOUR BROTHER BEFORE THE SHOOTING? ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY? ANY MONEY ISSUES? KENNY DID TELL ME THIS THING BOTHERIN' HIM RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED. KAY HAD WITHDRAWN MONEY FROM ONE OF THEIR ACCOUNTS, SOMETHING LIKE $6,000. HE THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA USE TO WALK OUT ON HIM. DOES THAT CHANGE THE INVESTIGATION? SURE, IT CHANGES IT. EVERYTHING CAN CHANGE IT. AT SOME POINT, YOU NEED TO KINDA BACK OFF, REGROUP A LITTLE BIT AND -- AND KINDA GET YOUR HEADS TOGETHER ON -- ON WHERE YOU'RE GONNA GO FROM HERE. WE CAN SEE THAT KAY CLOUD WAS MOVING MONEY BETWEEN HER ACCOUNTS AND TAKING OUT LARGE SUMS OF CASH. BUT WE COULDN'T TELL WHERE THE CASH WAS GOING. YOU GOT THE WIFE RAPIDLY LOSING HER STATUS AS A WITNESS AND A VICTIM. KAY CLOUD WAS LOOKING MORE AND MORE AS A SUSPECT. YOU KNOW, I THINK SHE JUST MIGHTA DONE IT. AND SHE PAID FOR IT WITH HER HUSBAND'S OWN MONEY. IT'S BEEN 3 YEARS SINCE KENNETH CLOUD'S MURDER. AND WE'RE STILL NO CLOSER TO FINDING VINCENT ACARDO. AND, AT THIS TIME, MY MENTOR AND PARTNER, BRYAN ROGERS, WAS RETIRING. AND I WAS OFFICIALLY GIVEN THE CASE FOR THE MURDER OF KENNETH CLOUD. BRYAN ROGERS FIGURED OUT PRETTY MUCH THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF THAT CASE. BUT HE COULD NOT FIND ACARDO. DURING THAT TIME FRAME, I ALSO TOOK OVER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE VICTIM'S FAMILY. KEN CLOUD'S BROTHER, JOHNNY, AND HIS SISTER, NORMA, WOULD COME IN MONTH AFTER MONTH ASKING FOR ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BROTHER'S MURDER. SEEING THIS GRIEVING FAMILY WAS A CONSTANT REMINDER I'D FAILED TO SOLVE THIS CASE. THAT WAS IT. SOMETHING HAD TO GIVE. HEY, SERGEANT, YOU GOT A MINUTE? BILL, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET. BUT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN GIVEN THE RESOURCES ALLOCATED. DON'T GIVE ME THIS CRAP ABOUT RESOURCES. LET'S CALL THE FBI. LET'S SPEND SOME MONEY ON THIS. I JUST DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN AFFORD IT. WE HAVE TO. OTHERWISE, YOU GUYS CAN MEET WITH THE CLOUDS EACH TIME THEY COME AROUND. TELL 'EM WE'RE DOING THE BEST THAT WE CAN WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT. AFTER THAT MEETING, WE WERE ABLE TO FORM A TASK FORCE SO I COULD FOCUS ALL MY TIME ON SOLVING THE CLOUD CASE. WE STILL DIDN'T KNOW WHERE VINCENT ACARDO WAS. AND NOW WE REALIZED THAT KAY CLOUD COULD BE THE KEY TO FINDING HIM. THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS GO BACK TO KAY CLOUD'S PHONE RECORDS TO SEE IF WE MISSED ANYTHING. KAY CLOUD HAD TWO LAND LINES AND A CELL PHONE. AND SHE'S ON THE PHONE A LOT. EVERY DAY WITH A HIGHLIGHTER CROSSING NUMBERS OUT, MARKING NUMBERS. MY ASSUMPTION WAS THERE HAD TO BE SOMETHING WE'RE MISSING. THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER PHONE SOMEPLACE. HEY, MARTIN? YEAH? YOU'RE GONNA WANNA TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. YOU RECOGNIZE THIS NUMBER? IT LOOKS LOCAL, BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN IT ANYWHERE BEFORE. LET'S GIVE IT A TRY. OKAY. HI, BABY. A FEMALE ANSWERED THE PHONE, SAYING "HI, BABY." BABY? AND IT'S KAY CLOUD. VINNY BABY? VINCENT? SURE AS HELL SOUNDED LIKE KAY CLOUD TO ME. YOU'RE SURE IT WAS HER? IT GETS BETTER. GUESS WHO SHE THOUGHT IT WAS CALLIN' HER. TELL ME SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE VINCENT ACARDO. SHE CALLS HIM VINNY, VINNY BABY. WE TOOK THAT NUMBER. WE SUBPOENAED THE SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION, WHO OWNS THE PHONE. AND IT COMES BACK. IT WAS A BURNER PHONE. AND IT WAS REGISTERED TO KAY CLOUD. SHE MUST HAVE CALLED THE PHONE FROM HER LAND LINE TO CHECK THE VOICE MAIL. THAT'S THE PHONE WE'VE BEEN LOOKIN' FOR. WE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER. THIS IS OUR CONNECTION. ONCE WE HAD THE PHONE LINE AND KNEW THAT KAY CLOUD AND VINCENT ACARDO WERE USING IT TO COMMUNICATE, WE HAD ENOUGH EVIDENCE FOR A WIRE TAP. THIS WAS THE FIRST WIRETAP THAT OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD EVER DONE. WE WANTED TO HEAR THEM TALK, TO HAVE A RECORDING OF HIM AND HER TALKING AND POSSIBLY ADMITTING TO SOMETHING WOULD BE INVALUABLE FOR THE CASE. HI, BABY. I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU. THAT'S ALL. CAN'T A GIRL THINK ABOUT A MAN? OH, YEAH, OF COURSE. I JUST WANNA SEE YOU. THAT'S ALL. THAT HOTEL IN SAN DIEGO -- WILL WE EVER BE TOGETHER AGAIN? WE COULDN'T BE SURE EXACTLY WHEN IT STARTED. BUT IT BECAME CLEAR THAT, AT SOME POINT AFTER THEY MET AT THE BANK, KAY CLOUD AND ACARDO HAD BECOME ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED. IT WASN'T UNTIL WE DID THE WIRETAP AND ACTUALLY COULD HEAR CONVERSATIONS THAT, YOU KNOW, I GO, "HOLY COW! SHE IS SO IN -- IN LOVE WITH THIS GUY!" OF COURSE WE WILL. COME ON, IT'S KILLING ME, TOO. JUST GOTTA HAVE SOME OF THAT MONEY IN THE MEANTIME. SHE WOULD DO ANYTHING. AND HE'S PLAYIN' HER, YOU KNOW, LIKE A VIOLIN. I'LL GIVE YOU WHATEVER YOU NEED, BABY. SHE KNEW ABOUT THE FRAUD ON THE BANK. SO SHE KNEW HE WASN'T STRAIGHT AND NARROW. VINCENT ACARDO WAS VERY FLAMBOYANT, VERY OUTGOING. KENNY WAS A GENTLEMAN FARMER. YOU KNOW, HE DRESSED LIKE THE FARM GUYS DO OUT THERE. HE DROVE A WHITE PICKUP TRUCK LIKE THEY ALL DID. KAY WAS A LITTLE MORE SOPHISTICATED. SHE WANTED TO LIVE IN, UH, YOU KNOW, A NICE HOME. SHE WANTED NICE THINGS. KENNY WAS SOMEWHAT DULL AND -- AND JUST, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING'S THE SAME EVERY DAY, A ROUTINE THAT SHE WANTED TO BREAK OUT OF. BUT SHE WAS AFRAID TO BREAK OUT OF IT, I THINK. THAT'S MY TAKE. THAT'S WHAT I KINDA THINK ABOUT IT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SECOND HONEYMOON EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE THIS TIME. MMM. I PROMISE. I JUST GOTTA GET MORE MONEY IN THE MEANTIME, OKAY? I NEED IT. WELL, I DON'T WANT MY HUSBAND TO WORRY ABOUT FINANCES. THAT REALLY SURPRISED US. IT WAS LIKE, HOW COULD SHE MARRY THIS GUY? HE -- HE MURDERED HER HUSBAND! HE NEVER DID SAY ANYTHING DIRECTLY ABOUT THE MURDER ON THOSE CALLS. BUT WE WERE ABLE TO TRACE THE BURNER PHONE. AND IT WAS ONLY USED TO CALL ONE NUMBER, WHICH WAS IN MCALLEN, TEXAS. WE ASKED A DETECTIVE FROM THE FBI VIOLENT TASK FORCE IN MCALLEN. WE GAVE HIM THAT ADDRESS. HE DID SURVEILLANCE ON THAT. AND IT WAS ON A GOLF COURSE IN A GATED COMMUNITY. AND HE SAW VINCENT ACARDO AND LISA BAKER IN AND AROUND THAT ADDRESS AND THAT HOUSE. WE'RE OUTSIDE. WE GOT HIM. WE KNEW WHERE THEY WERE. WE KNEW WHERE THEY LIVED. THE MONEY THAT LISA BAKER AND VINCENT ACARDO AND THEIR TWO CHILDREN WERE LIVING ON IN A GATED COMMUNITY, BEAUTIFUL HOME, ALL THAT MONEY TO SUPPORT THEM WAS GIVEN TO HIM BY KAY CLOUD. IT ANGERS YOU THAT HERE'S THESE TWO PEOPLE LIVIN' OFF THE PROCEEDS FROM BEIN' INVOLVED WITH THE MURDER OF THIS FARMER. AND THEY'RE LIVIN' WELL. WE KNEW WHERE ACARDO WAS. BUT WE STILL DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO ARREST HIM. WE CAN GO INTERVIEW 'EM. BUT, IF THEY DON'T TELL US ANYTHING, WE CAN'T ARREST THEM. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY JURISDICTION. TEXAS CAN'T ARREST HIM. BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AN ARREST WARRANT. SO THE MOMENT WE TURN OUR BACK, ACARDO'S GONNA BE GONE. WE NEED THEM IN THREE ROOMS RIGHT HERE IN YUMA -- ACARDO, KAY AND LISA BAKER. THAT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN WITH WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR. I GOT AN IDEA. WE DECIDED TO MEET WITH CLOUD'S FAMILY, JOHNNY CLOUD, AND BRING THEM IN AND -- AND DO AN INTERVIEW WITH THE NEWSPAPER. WE JUST WANT OUR BROTHER'S MURDERER BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. JOHNNY CLOUD DID HIS THING. AND -- AND HE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB. AND THEN I SPOKE TO THE REPORTER. AND I SAID, "THERE'S TWO PEOPLE WE WANTED TO TALK TO." WE WANTED TO TALK TO VINCENT ACARDO AND LISA BAKER. IT WAS SUNDAY MORNING WHEN THE PAPER CAME OUT. AND IT HAD A PHOTOGRAPH OF LISA BAKER AND VINCENT ACARDO THAT I'D GIVEN THE PRESS. AND IT'S BASICALLY SAYIN' THAT WE REOPENED THE CASE. OUR HOPE WAS THAT THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE WOULD RATTLE KATE CLOUD AND ACARDO AND GET THEM TO TALK ABOUT THEIR CRIME OVER THE PHONE. HELLO? I JUST GOT THE PAPER. AND THERE'S A BIG PICTURE OF YOU ON THE FRONT PAGE. IT SAYS THE COPS WANT -- WANNA QUESTION YOU IN KENNY'S MURDER. I'M IN MORE TROUBLE THAN I THOUGHT. OH, GOD. I FEEL SICK. WHAT AM I GONNA DO? DON'T SAY NOTHING TO NOBODY. AND YOU GOTTA SEND ME MY MONEY. HE MIGHT AS WELL BE SAYING, "I SHOT KENNETH CLOUD." IT WAS THAT CONVERSATION THAT GAVE US ENOUGH ON TAPE TO SHOW THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MURDER. AND WE COULD FINALLY TAKE ACTION. HOW SOON CAN I GET A WARRANT? THIS WAS THE DAY I'D BEEN WAITING FOR FOR 3 YEARS. I FINALLY HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO ARREST VINCENT ACARDO AND KAY CLOUD FOR THE MURDER OF HER HUSBAND. WHAT'S THE ETA ON THE WARRANTS? THEY'RE ON THE RUN. WE NEED TO GO. WE NEED IT NOW. WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW. OUR SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS -- THEY WERE VERY CONCERNED THAT THEY WERE GONNA SHOOT STRAIGHT THROUGH BROWNSVILLE AND HIT THE BORDER AND BLOW THE PORT, BASICALLY, TO CROSS INTO MEXICO. OUR AGENTS IN TEXAS KEPT A TAIL ON ACARDO WHILE MY PARTNER AND I HEADED OVER TO KAY CLOUD'S HOUSE. ALL WE NEEDED NOW WAS THE WARRANT. THEY'RE GONNA BE IN MEXICO ANY MINUTE. WE NEED THAT WARRANT OR WE'RE GONNA LOSE 'EM. I WAS ABLE TO GET WITH THE PROSECUTOR AND THE COUNTY ISSUED ARREST WARRANTS FOR VINCENT ACARDO, LISA BAKER, KATE CLOUD, AND BETTY HOWERTON. OKAY, TAKE 'EM. OUT OF THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR! GET OUTTA THE CAR! OUTTA THE VEHICLE! WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? STEP BEHIND THE VEHICLE, SIR. WHAT? ARE YOU GUYS COPS OR WHAT? GET BEHIND THE VEHICLE, SIR. ON YOUR KNEES. ON YOUR KNEES. OUTTA THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR! LET'S GO. HANDS UP. OUT OF THE VEHICLE. HAVE ANYTHING I SHOULD BE AWARE OF? NO. AND I WAS EXCITED. THIS WAS THE MOMENT. LOIS KAY CLOUD? YES. I LOOKED AT HER. AND I SAID, "YOU REMEMBER ME?" YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR THE MURDER OF KEN CLOUD. WHAT? UH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. I -- I SAW THEM SAY THAT ON TV ALL THE TIME. AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO SAY THAT TO SOMEONE, "YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR THE MURDER..." IT -- IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YA -- I HAD TO DO AT SOME POINT IN MY LIFE. AND I DID. ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW. YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE. ALL THE WORK THAT BRYAN DID, ALL THE WORK THAT -- THAT WE DID AND THE WIRETAP, AND -- AND JUST THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF HOURS ON EVERYBODY'S PART -- THIS WAS THE MOMENT WE HAD ALL WORKED FOR. VINCENT ACARDO, LISA BAKER AND KAY CLOUD ARE IN CUSTODY FOR THE MURDER OF KENNETH CLOUD. IT FELT LIKE A SUCCESS. BUT WE KNEW WE COULDN'T GET A MURDER CONVICTION UNLESS ONE OF THEM CONFESSED TO ACARDO PULLING THE TRIGGER. DURING HIS INTERVIEW, VINCENT ACARDO CLAIMED THAT IT WAS ALL FOR THE MONEY. HE ADMITTED TO SWINDLING KAY CLOUD, TAKIN' HER FOR HER MONEY, TAKIN' ALL HER MONEY, EVERYTHING THAT SHE WOULD GIVE HIM. HE ADMITTED TO ALL THOSE THINGS BUT NOT TO THE MURDER. KAY CLOUD INVOKED HER RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. THAT LEADS ME TO THE BELIEF WE'RE ON THE RIGHT ROAD. THE LAST CHANCE I HAD TO GET ANYONE TO TALK WAS LISA BAKER. WE KNOW YOU WERE WITH ACARDO IN YUMA FOR A WEEK LEADING UP TO THE MURDER -ON DECEMBER 9 -TH. I WAS AT HOME IN MCALLEN. SO WAS HE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER BEEN TO ARIZONA. WHY ARE YOU PROTECTING HIM? BECAUSE HE'S MY HUSBAND. AND HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I'M REALLY EXCITED, SWEETIE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SECOND HONEYMOON EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE THIS TIME. I PROMISE. JUST LEMME GET MORE MONEY IN THE MEANTIME, OKAY? I NEED IT. WELL, I DON'T WANT MY HUSBAND TO WORRY ABOUT FINANCES. I LOVE THE WAY THAT SOUNDS, HUSBAND. CAN YOU STOP THE TAPE, PLEASE? IT WAS OBVIOUS BY HOW UPSET SHE GOT THAT LISA HAD NO IDEA THAT HER HUSBAND WAS ACTUALLY MARRIED TO ANOTHER WOMAN. WHAT DO YOU WANNA KNOW? LISA BAKER WAS GOING TO GIVE EVERYTHING UP THAT SHE KNEW. WHEN THEY WERE IN YUMA, BETTY HOWERTON AND LISA ARE IN THE HOTEL ROOM FOR ABOUT A WEEK. LISA CONTACTED ACARDO AND SAID, "WE'RE TIRED OF THIS. WE'RE LEAVIN'." WHERE'VE YOU BEEN? IT'S TIME TO GO. I'M SICK OF BEING HERE. I KNOW. I GOT SOMETHING I GOTTA DO BEFORE WE LEAVE THIS PLACE. YOU'RE PUSHIN' IT. HE SAYS HE'S GOTTA GO OVER TO BURGERS & BEER TO CONDUCT SOME BUSINESS, A LAND DEAL WITH THIS PERSON. -THAT DAY IS DECEMBER 9 -TH, '97. WHAT ARE WE DOIN' HERE, BABE? I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THIS COUPLE COMES OUTTA THE RESTAURANT. HE SAYS, "THAT'S THEM," AND HE GETS OUTTA THE CAR. OH! OH, MY GOD! SOMEBODY HELP ME! WHAT SHOCKED HER WAS LOOKING IN AND SEEIN' HER HUSBAND OF 15 YEARS LAYING ON THE DRIVER'S SEAT WITH HIS LIFE RUNNING OUT OF HIS THROAT. THAT'S WHAT GOT HER SCREAMIN' AND YELLIN', I'M SURE. SOMEBODY HELP ME, PLEASE! SHE WASN'T PLANNIN' ON IT BEIN' THAT VIOLENT. HEY, COME ON. LET'S GO. LET'S GO. WHAT WAS THAT? HONEY, WHAT DID YOU DO? THAT GUY TRIED TO KILL ME, ALL RIGHT? AND HE TELLS 'EM IT WAS A MOB HIT. I HAD TO HIT HIM OR THEY WERE GONNA HIT ME. C'MON, BABY. JUST DRIVE. THEY TAKE OFF, THEN THEY GET ON THE INTERSTATE AND THEY HEAD TO TUCSON. AND, IN TUCSON, HE THREW THE GUN IN A DUMPSTER. AND THEN THEY CONTINUED ON TO TEXAS. LISA BAKER AND BETTY HOWERTON TESTIFIED AGAINST ACARDO AND KAY CLOUD DURING THEIR TRIAL. LISA BAKER TOOK THE PLEA TO HINDERING PROSECUTION. AND SHE WAS SENTENCED TO 2 1/2 YEARS IN PRISON. BETTY HOWERTON DID VERY WELL TESTIFYING. SO SHE WAS NOT CHARGED. VINCENT ACARDO WENT TO TRIAL IN THE SPRING OF 2008. HE WAS CONVICTED OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER, CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER AND, UH, HE BASICALLY RECEIVED THE DEATH PENALTY IN ARIZONA. HE DIED IN PRISON A FEW YEARS LATER ON DEATH ROW OF NAT -- HE DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES. KAY CLOUD WAS ALSO CONVICTED OF MURDER AND CONSPIRACY. AND, UM, SHE DID RECEIVE LIFE, UH, WITHOUT PAROLE AND WAS SPARED THE DEATH PENALTY. THE PHONE CALLS PROVED THAT KAY CLOUD AND VINCENT ACARDO WERE CONSPIRATORS IN THE MURDER OF KENNETH CLOUD. WHEN I HEARD THOSE CONVERSATIONS DURING A WIRETAP FROM KAY CLOUD, I FELT SORRY FOR HER. I THINK, BEFORE THAT, I -- I -- I TRULY BELIEVED THAT, UH, SHE WAS A MURDERESS, COLD-BLOODED. THEY WALKED ARM-IN-ARM TO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. AND SHE KISSED HIM. HOW COULD YOU DO THAT KNOWING THAT, IN 30 SECONDS, HE WAS GONNA BE DEAD? I CALL THAT THE JUDAS KISS. BUT THAT NEVER WOULD'VE HAPPENED IF IT WASN'T FOR HER MEETING VINCENT ACARDO. I THINK, AS EVERYBODY KNEW, SHE WAS GONNA SIT DOWN AND GO, "OH, MY GOD. WHAT DID I DO? WHAT DID I GET INTO? I LOST EVERYTHING. I HAD EVERYTHING. I LOST IT FOR THIS GUY THAT WAS TAKIN' ME FOR A RIDE." VINCENT ACARDO MURDERED KENNETH CLOUD FOR THE MONEY. KAY CLOUD MURDERED HIM FOR LOVE. BUT, UH, A LOT OF TIMES, WITH THESE CASES, AND, AS A -- AS A HOMICIDE GUY, YOU KNOW, IT'S, UH, THE CASE IS OVER. THE TRIAL'S OVER. EVERYBODY, UH, YOU KNOW, UH, MAYBE HAS A BEER OR SODA OR MEETS SOMEPLACE AT A RESTAURANT, HAVE A -- HAVE DINNER. YOU COMIN', BILL? YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. AND THEN, BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, PROBABLY BY THE TIME YOU GET HOME, YOU'RE CALLED OUT AGAIN TO A DIFFERENT ONE. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
