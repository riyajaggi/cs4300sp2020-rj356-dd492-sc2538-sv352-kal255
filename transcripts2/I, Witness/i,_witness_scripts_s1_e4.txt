OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS -WHO IS IT, MAMA? -HOLD ON. IT'S GRANDMA. -HI, GRANDMA! -HI, GRANDMA! I GOT THE CALL FROM MY MOM MARCH 24th. I have a question for you. HAVE YOU SEEN OR SPOKEN TO DAVON LATELY? NO, MAMA. SHE WAS CONCERNED BECAUSE SHE HADN'T HEARD FROM MY YOUNGEST BROTHER, DAVON. HE HADN'T COME HOME, WHICH WAS VERY UNLIKE HIM. IF HE ACTUALLY WAS NOT GOING TO COME HOME, HE WOULD AT LEAST CALL. MAMA, I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING. LET ME CALL HIM. -I'LL CALL YOU BACK. -OKAY. -Okay. -THANK YOU, BABY. HE'S NOT PICKING UP THE PHONE. I DIDN'T REALLY THINK MUCH OF IT. WHEN YOU'RE 17 AND YOU GET IN THAT MIND SET OF HAVING THAT TITLE OF "NOW I'M AN ADULT," SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET A LITTLE LAX. -UH-OH! -HERE WE GO. -YOUR BOY KNOWS WHAT'S UP. -NO, WE HUSTLING. -OH, NO, THIS IS IT! -WHOO! GO, GO, GO, GO! ALEX DAVON BUCKMAN, WE CALL HIM DAVON, IS MY 17-YEAR-OLD BROTHER. HE IS THE BABY OUT OF THREE. BECAUSE DAVON AND I ARE 12 YEARS APART, I FELT MORE LIKE HIS MOTHER THAN HIS SISTER. THAT'S MY BROTHER! THAT'S MY BROTHER! ANYTHING THAT A MOTHER WOULD DO FOR THEIR CHILD, I DID IT. AND -- AND I WANTED TO. I WAS SO EXCITED TO HAVE A LITTLE BROTHER. WATCHING HIM ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD IS MAGICAL, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, ONCE HE GOT THAT BALL, IT WAS OVER. -AWW. -OOH-OOH! -OH! -OH! MY HUSBAND WAS, AT THAT TIME, A DEPUTY FOR SPARTANBURG COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. HEY, BABY, WHO WAS THAT? MAMA? YEAH, DAVON DIDN'T COME HOME LAST NIGHT. I HAVE TO GET THE KIDS READY. WILL YOU LOOK INTO IT AT THE STATION? CRESHA, I'M SURE IT'S FINE. MAURICE, PLEASE? OKAY. BUT YOU KNOW HE'S PROBABLY JUST WITH FRIENDS. BOYS WILL BE BOYS. -I'LL SEE YOU LATER. -ALL RIGHT, BABY. MY BROTHER WAS ALWAYS HANGING OUT WITH HIS FRIENDS FROM HIGH SCHOOL. HIS TWO BEST FRIENDS WERE TRELL AND CLIFF. I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW TRELL THAT WELL, BUT I DID KNOW CLIFF. DAVON HUNG OUT WITH CLIFF, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS ALWAYS GETTING INTO TROUBLE. I THINK DAVON SAW MORE IN CLIFF. CLIFF WAS ACTUALLY A VERY, VERY SMART YOUNG MAN. NOW, SEE, NOW YOU DONE GOT IT STARTED. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. -ALL RIGHT. -OH, MAN. -OH, HERE WE GO. -WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UP, GIRL? COME ON. -HEY, WHAT'S UP? -CAN YOU TAKE HIM? HEY, BABY. HEY, JAMARIUS. WHEN I FOUND OUT DAVON WAS GOING TO BE A FATHER, I WAS FURIOUS. I WAS FURIOUS BECAUSE, AT THAT POINT, TO ME, I FELT LIKE EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED FOR HIM LOOKED A LITTLE DOWN. I -- REALLY, I HONESTLY WAS LIKE, "IT'S OVER." BUT WHEN I SAW HIM WITH THE BABY, HE REALLY STEPPED INTO FATHERHOOD NATURALLY. JAMARIUS BECAME HIS TOP PRIORITY. AND HE EVEN TALKED ABOUT GIVING UP FOOTBALL. MOM! THE FIRST MESSAGE THAT I LEFT FOR HIM WAS BASIC. "HEY," YOU KNOW, "CALL ME." YOU KNOW, "MOM CALLED ME AND TOLD ME YOU DIDN'T COME HOME. SHE HADN'T HEARD FROM YOU. SO CALL ME AND LET ME KNOW YOU'RE OKAY." ONCE I CALLED MY MOTHER BACK AND TOLD HER THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO REACH HIM, I CONTINUED TO CALL HIS PHONE, CONTINUED TO LEAVE MESSAGES. HIS PHONE WAS STILL RINGING. IT WASN'T GOING STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL, SO I KNEW HIS PHONE WAS STILL ON. THIS ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE, DAVON. I'M GETTING SCARED. YOU NEED TO STOP WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE DOING AND CALL ME BACK. AW, BABY, WHAT HAPPENED? I CUT MYSELF. WHAT'S WRONG? HE HASN'T CALLED BACK. AND I'M JUST STARTING TO GET WORRIED THAT MAYBE SOMETHING'S WRONG. DAVON IS NOT LIKE THIS! CRESHA, I CHECKED WITH THE HOSPITALS AND EMERGENCY ROOMS. THERE'S NOTHING. YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T MY JURISDICTION. HE PROBABLY JUST LOST HIS PHONE. I DON'T THINK SO. I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT. MAYBE I SHOULD FILE A POLICE REPORT. FOR WHAT? IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE GONNA SEND OUT A SEARCH PARTY TO LOOK FOR HIM OR ANYTHING. HE'S JUST A YOUNG BLACK TEENAGER. THAT SHOULDN'T MATTER! THE REALITY IS, WITHOUT A LEAD, HARD EVIDENCE, THE POLICE AREN'T GONNA DO ANYTHING. YOU'RE BETTER OFF GOING OUT THERE, DOING THE POLICE WORK YOURSELF. I DIDN'T SLEEP. I DID NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT AT ALL. THE NEXT DAY WAS GOOD FRIDAY. AND I WENT TO MY MOM'S HOUSE TO PICK HER UP FOR CHURCH. WHILE I WAS THERE, I LOOKED IN DAVON'S ROOM TO SEE IF ANYTHING WAS MISSING. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM? WEDNESDAY. I KNEW IT'S NO WAY THAT HE WOULD BE GONE DAYS AND NOT HAVE INTERACTION WITH THAT LITTLE BOY. SO AFTER THE GOOD FRIDAY SERVICE, WE DECIDED TO ASK AROUND. HAVE YOU SEEN DAVON? UM, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE, UH, WEDNESDAY, IN CHURCH. EVERYONE I SPOKE TO SAID THE LAST TIME THEY SAW HIM WAS ON WEDNESDAY. -NO PROBLEM. -HAVE A GOOD ONE. -GOD BLESS. -YEAH, TAKE CARE. -LaCRESHA, WEDNESDAY AGAIN? -I KNOW. BUT THE WIND'S OUT OF THE EAST AT 14 MILES PER HOUR. -IT'S CURRENTLY... -AT THIS POINT, I WAS DESPERATE, BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH FINDING MY BROTHER. AND I GOT A CALL FROM MY MOTHER THAT SHE HEARD SOMETHING TERRIBLE ABOUT DAVON. HEY, MA. WHAT? CALM DOWN AND CALL THE POLICE. I'M COMING OVER. I GOT TO MY MOTHER'S HOUSE. SPARTANBURG CITY POLICE WAS THERE. MY MOM GOT A CALL THAT THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND THAT DAVON WAS BEAT UP AND FORCED INTO THE TRUNK OF A WHITE CAR. DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO OWNS A WHITE CAR? -NO. -ARE YOU SURE IT JUST COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A FRIEND OF HIS? -NO. -NO. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM? LAST WEEKEND. DAVON WAS AT MY HOUSE THE WEEKEND PRIOR. HE WAS BABYSITTING FOR ME. GIVE IT TO ME! -AH! -I GOT IT. WHAT? YOU CAN'T LET HER GET THE CROWN! HE IS THE ULTIMATE BABYSITTER. MY DAUGHTERS LOVE UNCLE DAVON. HE'S THAT UNCLE THAT, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE GIRLS, HE -- HE WOULD BE WILLING TO, YOU KNOW, CHANGE THEIR DIAPER AND GET 'EM DRESSED AND ACTUALLY DO THEIR HAIR. OKAY, YOU GUYS. ENOUGH PLAYING. YOU TWO GO UPSTAIRS AND GET READY FOR BED, ALL RIGHT? -OKAY. -ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU LATER. -HEY, CRESHA. -HEY, YOU. -HOW YOU DOING? -I'M DOING GOOD. YEAH? LOOK. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THIS IS I'M HEARING ABOUT YOU NOT GOING TO COLLEGE. I GOT A JOB. FLIPPING BURGERS AND BABYSITTING ISN'T EXACTLY A CAREER. DAVON, YOU HAVE COLLEGE RECRUITERS COMING TO ALL YOUR GAMES TO SEE YOU! CRESHA, PLAYING FOOTBALL, PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL, IS -- IT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT FOR ME NO MORE. DON'T YOU DARE SAY THAT. LOOK, DAVON, IF YOU FOCUS AND WORK HARD AND SET YOUR MIND TO IT, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. I-I GOT TO BE HERE FOR -- FOR JAMARIUS. I KNOW YOU LOVE YOUR SON. BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE? YOU CAN REALLY TAKE CARE OF HIM! YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT A RIDE? MM, NO, I GOT IT. OKAY. WELL, TELL MOM I'LL BE BY AT 10:00 TO TAKE HER TO THE DOCTOR'S. THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM. I DEFINITELY AM KIND OF IN PANIC MODE. HE DIDN'T TAKE ANY CLOTHES. THAT'S NOT LIKE DAVON. WE FILLED OUT A MISSING PERSON'S REPORT. AND I TOLD THEM THAT DAVON NEVER GOT INTO ANY TROUBLE. HE HAS NO ENEMIES. HE'S -- HE'S NOT -- HE DOESN'T GET INTO FIGHTS WITH PEOPLE. AND I HAD THE FEELING THAT THE POLICE WEREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. WE'LL LOOK INTO IT. CRESHA, BABY, WHERE YOU GOING WITH THAT? I'M GONNA GO LOOK FOR HIM! I DECIDED THAT IT WAS TIME THAT I HIT THE STREETS AND START GOING DOOR TO DOOR LOOKING FOR MY BROTHER. -HEY, WHAT'S GOOD, CRESHA? -HEY. I'M LOOKING FOR DAVON. HAVE YOU SEEN HIM? NAH, I AIN'T SEEN HIM OVER HERE SINCE WEDNESDAY. WHEN HE LEFT, DID HE TELL YOU WHERE HE WAS GOING? YOU KNOW ANYBODY OWNS A WHITE CAR? NAH, I DON'T THINK SO. -ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. -NO PROBLEM. HAVE YOU SEEN DAVON? TUESDAY WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM. OH. I VERY MUCH FELT LIKE AN INVESTIGATOR, BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO CONNECT DOTS AND MAKE SENSE OF A TIMELINE. -WHAT'S UP, CRESHA? -MY COUSIN, JAYMEL, IS VERY CLOSE TO DAVON. HAVE YOU SEEN DAVON? YEAH, HE WAS OVER HERE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES. WHAT TIME DID HE LEAVE? LIKE 8:00, MAYBE. IT WAS DARK. WHAT ABOUT YOU, TRELL? WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM? EARLY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND DAVON WAS THROWN INTO THE BACK OF A WHITE CAR. Y'ALL KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT? -NO. -NAH. MY HUSBAND TOLD ME THAT HE LOOKED INTO THE RUMOR ABOUT THE WHITE CAR. BUT NO ONE ON THE STREETS WAS TALKING. IT WAS DISAPPOINTING. BUT I WASN'T GONNA GIVE UP. HEY, WHAT'S UP? REAL QUICK -- I RALLIED TOGETHER AUNTS, UNCLES, COUSINS, DAVON'S FRIENDS, TRELL. AND BY 12:00, WE WERE ON THE STREETS. -HEY, CRESHA. -MM? I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE LAST TIME I SAW DAVON. -HE WAS PRETTY UPSET. -UPSET? HE HAD A BEEF WITH SOME GUY. I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT IT, BUT IT SOUNDED SERIOUS. WHAT GUY? DID HE GIVE YOU A NAME? NO, BUT I THINK TRELL WAS WITH HIM, THOUGH. -YO, TRELL. -YEAH. WHO DID DAVON HAVE AN ARGUMENT WITH THAT LAST WEDNESDAY HE WENT MISSING? OH, YOU MEAN THAT THING WITH -- WITH RALPH. RALPH? RALPH FLEMMING? CLIFF'S BROTHER? -CAN YOU TAKE OVER? -OKAY. MAKE SURE YOU HIT UP ALL THE STORES. A'IGHT. AFTER TALKING TO TRELL, I KNEW THAT DAVON'S DISAPPEARANCE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH CLIFF FLEMMING. I THINK MY BROTHER'S DISAPPEARANCE IS CONNECTED TO CLIFF FLEMMING'S PARTY A FEW WEEKS AGO. I'M POSITIVE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT PARTY. OKAY. I'M LISTENING. DAVON WAS AT A PARTY WITH A BUNCH OF HIS FRIENDS AT CLIFF FLEMMING'S HOUSE. AND AT SOME POINT IN THE NIGHT, CLIFF GOT INTO IT WITH SOME OTHER GUY. YO, WATCH WHERE YOU WALKING, SON. YO, YO, WHAT'S UP? HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, DUDE! HOLD UP! ALL RIGHT. HOLD UP. HOLD UP. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? W-W-WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? I'M-A SHOW HIM WHAT'S UP! D-DUDE, C-COME ON. WHAT'S WRONG, MAN? HE GONNA SIT THERE AND TRY TO EMBARRASS ME LIKE THAT? M-MAN, C-COME ON, MAN. DUDE, C-CALM DOWN, MAN. YOU GOT TO LET THAT GO. WHAT'S WRONG, DUDE? MAN, HE JUST SAT THERE AND DISRESPECTED ME LIKE THAT! -IN MY OWN HOUSE? -OH, MY GOSH. C-CLIFF, LET IT GO, MAN! YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THAT OUT THERE. YOU DON'T! DUDE, JUST PUT IT AWAY. PUT IT AWAY, MAN. CLIFF. HEY, I-I'LL GO MAKE HIM LEAVE RIGHT NOW, ALL RIGHT? JUST CALM DOWN. DAVON KNEW NOT TO GET IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. -HEY, TRELL. -SO HE ASKED HIS FRIEND TRELL -TO TELL THE GUY TO LEAVE. -CLIFF IS TRIPPIN'! HE LOOKS LIKE HE WAS GONNA DO SOME CRAZY STUFF, MAN, FOR REAL. HEY, MY MAN, CAN I TALK TO YOU REAL QUICK? ONCE THINGS WERE UNDER CONTROL, DAVON DUCKED OUT TO THE BATHROOM. YOU WANT TO GO ANYWHERE? RIGHT NOW, YO. A'IGHT, MAN, NAH. YOU ACTING A LITTLE WILD NOW. YO, WHAT'S UP, MAN? WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UP? -AAH! -WHAT'S UP?! DAVON CRACKED THE DOOR AND PEEKED OUT. HE DIDN'T SEE ANYONE. SO, FROM THERE, HE RAN OUT THE HOUSE AND WENT HOME. IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK SINCE MY BROTHER, DAVON, HAS BEEN MISSING. AND I JUST LEARNED THAT HIS DISAPPEARANCE MAY BE CONNECTED TO A SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE AT HIS BEST FRIEND CLIFF'S HOUSE. THE VICTIM OF THE SHOOTING PASSED AWAY. AND CLIFF WAS BEING CHARGED FOR MURDER. I BROUGHT DAVON HERE, AND HE GAVE A STATEMENT. YOU HAVE IT ON RECORD. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? I KNOW THAT HE WAS BATTLING WITH WHAT HAPPENED, BECAUSE HERE, THIS IS YOUR BEST FRIEND THAT HAS DONE SOMETHING VERY HORRIBLE. SO YOU'RE BATTLING BACK AND FORTH WITH, "DO I SAY SOMETHING?" 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM GET IN TROUBLE. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED? I WAS IN THE BATHROOM. I HEARD GUNSHOTS, WENT OUTSIDE. I RAN HOME. OKAY. DAVON HEARD THE SHOTS, BUT HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING. THAT'S IN HIS STATEMENT. SO WHAT? BUT DID YOU KNOW AFTER CLIFF GOT ARRESTED, RALPH CAME TO MY MOTHER'S HOUSE LOOKING FOR DAVON? RALPH FLEMMING, CLIFF FLEMMING'S OLDER BROTHER, WAS SOMEONE THAT WAS ALWAYS IN AND OUT OF JAIL. YO, DAVON! OPEN UP! IT'S COOL, MOM. I GOT IT. I GOT IT. HOLD ON. WHAT'S GOING ON, RALPH? W-WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? THE PROBLEM? THE PROBLEM IS MY BROTHER'S GOING TO JAIL 'CAUSE OF YOU. YOU SNITCHED HIM OUT. WAIT, WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I KNOW YOU WENT TO THE COPS. CALM DOWN, MAN. I DIDN'T TELL THE COPS ANYTHING ABOUT CLIFF. I-I CAN SHOW YOU. JUST HOLD ON. HE TOOK THE POLICE STATEMENT AND SHOWED IT TO RALPH. -SEE? IT'S RIGHT HERE, MAN. -LOOK, MAN. YOU HAD NO BUSINESS GOING TO THE PIGS IN THE FIRST PLACE. I-I KNOW, MAN. BUT READ IT. I-I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT CLIFF TO THE COPS. CLIFF'S MY BOY. W-WHY WOULD I DO THAT? THIS THING RIGHT HERE, THIS RIGHT HERE... -YEAH. -...MEANS JACK TO ME. MY BROTHER'S IN JAIL 'CAUSE OF YOU. SO YOU BEST WATCH YOUR BACK, HOMEY. RALPH KNEW MY HUSBAND WAS A DEPUTY SHERIFF. SO MAYBE HE THOUGHT DAVON TOLD MY HUSBAND SOMETHING MORE THAN WHAT WAS IN HIS STATEMENT. LET'S GO. DOESN'T THAT MAKE HIM A-A PERSON OF INTEREST? OKAY. I KNOW YOU JUST WANT TO FIND YOUR BROTHER. BUT UNTIL I HAVE SOMETHING MORE CONCRETE, I'M AFRAID YOU'RE JUST GRASPING AT STRAWS. THE INVESTIGATOR TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD NO LINKS, NO HARD EVIDENCE TO PROVE THESE TWO INCIDENTS WERE CONNECTED. I WAS VERY FRUSTRATED, BECAUSE I KNEW -- I KNEW IT WASN'T A COINCIDENCE. I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF ANYTHING CHANGES. RIGHT AFTER I SPOKE WITH THE POLICE, I WENT TO THE FLEMMINGS' RESIDENCE TO SPEAK WITH RALPH. AT THIS POINT, I'M FURIOUS. I WANT ANSWERS, AND I KNOW THAT RALPH FLEMMING HAS SOME ANSWERS. RALPH'S FATHER COMES TO THE DOOR. MR. FLEMMING, I'M LACRESHA STANTON. DAVON BUCKMAN'S MY BROTHER. MY I SPEAK WITH YOUR SON, RALPH? -IS HE HERE? -NO. WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS? NO, I DON'T. I REALLY NEED TO SPEAK WITH RALPH, TODAY. IT'S ABOUT MY BROTHER, DAVON. HE'S BEEN MISSING FOR OVER A WEEK. LOOK, SORRY. I JUST CAN'T HELP YOU. LOOK, I KNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO GET AHOLD OF HIM. YOU BETTER TELL HIM I'M LOOKING FOR HIM, AND I'M GONNA FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER. YOU TELL HIM THAT, OKAY? IT'S BEEN 3 WEEKS SINCE MY BROTHER'S BEEN MISSING. I KNEW RALPH FLEMMING WAS THE KEY TO FINDING OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO DAVON. I ALSO KNEW THAT NO ONE HE WAS HANGING WITH WAS GONNA TELL ME ANYTHING. I BECAME VERY FRUSTRATED AND DECIDED THAT IT WAS TIME THAT I CONTACT THE LOCAL MEDIA TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS STORY OF MY BROTHER'S DISAPPEARANCE WAS MORE VISIBLE. DAVON IS MY BABY BROTHER. AND, UM, HE'S A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STAR. EVERYBODY LOVES HIM. MY NEW NORMAL WAS GETTING MY DAUGHTERS READY FOR SCHOOL AND THEN MAKING MY PHONE CALLS FOR THE DAY TO SET UP TV STATION INTERVIEWS. HE'S BEEN MISSING SINCE MARCH 23rd. WE JUST HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM. MY TYPICAL DAY IS 4 TO 5 NEWS STORIES, 10 OR MORE NEWSPAPER INTERVIEWS. IT WAS A LOT OF WORK AND A LITTLE OVERWHELMING. BUT LUCKILY, I HAD MY FAMILY AND DAVON'S FRIENDS, ESPECIALLY TRELL, TO HELP OUT. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO RALPH FLEMMING? IF YOU'RE HIDING, RALPH, DON'T REST EASY. THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT. WHAT'S DONE IN THE DARK WILL COME TO LIGHT. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT RALPH BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE. YOU KNOW, DON'T REST EASY AND THINK THAT YOU'VE GOTTEN AWAY WITH ANYTHING, BECAUSE I AM GOING TO FIND OUT. BECAUSE OF THE TIRELESS WORK OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S OLDER SISTER, THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALEX DAVON BUCKMAN HAS REACHED STATEWIDE AND NATIONAL ATTENTION. THE SPARTANBURG SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HAS NOW NAMED RALPH FLEMMING A PERSON OF INTEREST IN THIS CASE. JUNE 3rd IS DAVON'S 18th BIRTHDAY. SO WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE HIS 18th BIRTHDAY, AS WELL AS SOMETHING TO BRING THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER AND RAISE MORE REWARD MONEY. ♪ GONNA LAY DOWN MY BURDENS ♪ ♪ DOWN BY THE RIVERSIDE ♪ AFTER TWO MONTHS OF SEARCHING, I'M DRAINED. THE COUNTLESS NEWS INTERVIEWS, THE COUNTLESS RADIO STATION INTERVIEWS, MAKING SURE THAT MY MOM IS NOT STRESSED. BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP HOPE OF FINDING DAVON, IF NOT FOR ME AND MY MOM, THEN FOR HIS SON, JAMARIUS. ♪ STUDY WAR NO MORE ♪ WHAT'S GOING ON? I MISS MY BOY, MAN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. THERE'S NOTHING. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO. I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW TRELL VERY WELL. BUT IN THAT TWO-MONTH TIME PERIOD, I GOT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH HIM. WE JUST GOT TO BE STRONG, STICK TOGETHER. YOU'RE FAMILY NOW. I REALLY APPRECIATED HIS PRESENCE. HE BECAME SOMEONE THAT I STARTED TO LOOK AT AS A LITTLE BROTHER. JAYMEL, THAT LAST WEDNESDAY YOU SAW DAVON, HE DIDN'T HAVE A CAR, RIGHT? HE WAS WALKING? HEY, CRESHA, TRY TO LET IT GO. JUST FOR THE DAY. -YOU'RE RUNNING YOURSELF DOWN. -YOU'RE RIGHT, SWEETIE. BUT I WAS THINKING, DID HE WALK OVER TO YOUR HOUSE THAT WEDNESDAY OR DRIVE? YEAH, HE DROVE. BUT IT WASN'T WEDNESDAY. IT WAS THURSDAY WHEN HE DROPPED BY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THURSDAY? YEAH, DAVON DROPPED BY ON THURSDAY. THAT CAN'T BE. EVERYBODY I ASKED SAID WEDNESDAY WAS THE LAST TIME THEY SAW DAVON. I KNOW FOR SURE IT WAS THURSDAY. -HE DROVE THERE? -MM-HMM. IN WHAT CAR? TRELL'S CAR. NAH. DAVON COULDN'T HAVE HAD HIS CAR. IT WAS TRELL'S CAR. WHERE IS HE? UH, HE LEFT. HEY, CRESHA. TRELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME DAVON WAS DRIVING YOUR CAR ON THURSDAY? NAH, THAT WAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. WEDNESDAY NIGHT? JAYMEL IS TELLING ME SOMETHING DIFFERENT. Listen, I can explain. There's just some stuff that Davon wouldn't want you to know about. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? Davon wanted to go into business. TRELL TOLD ME THEY WENT OVER TO THE FLEMMING HOUSE TO MEET WITH RALPH. LET'S MAKE THIS WORK. HEY, SO WHAT DO WE SAY TO HIM? Y-YOU KNOW HE STILL BLAMES ME FOR THAT STUFF THAT WENT DOWN. MAN, I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT, ALL RIGHT? -YOU SURE? -GET THAT OUT YOUR MIND. YEAH. HE'S PAST THAT. -ALL RIGHT. -IT'S BUSINESS NOW. -IT'S BUSINESS. -YOU GOOD? I'M GOOD, MAN. WHAT'S GOING ON, RALPH? -WHAT'S GOOD? -'SUP, RALPH. YEAH, WHATEVER. IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO SAVE THIS UP. NEVER HAD THIS MUCH AT ONCE BEFORE. MM-HMM. I'LL BE BACK. HEY, IS -- IS THIS HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO? YEAH. JUST THINK, THOUGH. BET YOU DOUBLE YOUR MONEY UP IN LIKE A WEEK. -YEAH? -SELLING THIS WEED. I JUST FOUND OUT THAT MY BROTHER'S BEST FRIEND TRELL HAS BEEN LYING TO ME ABOUT THE LAST TIME HE SAW DAVON. AND NOW I BELIEVE HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT HIS DISAPPEARANCE. DAVON WAS BUYING DRUGS FROM RALPH FLEMMING? HE FELT PRESSURED. I MEAN, HIM BEING A FATHER NOW AND STILL LIVING WITH HIS MOTHER. You paying for his kid and et cetera. I guess he just wanted to be a man. SO WHAT DID DAVON DO WHEN RALPH FLEMMING PULLED THE GUN? I THINK IT'S TIME YOU SNITCHES NEED TO GET OUT OF MY HOUSE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAN? WHAT YOU FLIPPING FOR? COME ON, RALPH, MAN, YOU KNOW ME FOR LIKE 10 YEARS, BRO. CLIFF IS MY BROTHER, MAN. YOU KNOW I WOULD NEVER DO THAT! YOU GOT 30 SECONDS TO GET THE HELL OUT. HEY, FINE, MAN. JUST GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY. FORGET YOUR MONEY. IT'S MY MONEY NOW, PLAYBOY. COME ON, RALPH. THAT'S ALL I GOT. I NEED THAT MONEY BACK, MAN. I NEED THAT MONEY. IT'S FOR MY KID, MAN. YOU GOT 10 SECONDS. DAVON WAS SO SCARED, MAN, HE TOOK THAT CAR AND JUST -- JUST DROVE OFF, LEFT ME THERE. SO WHAT ELSE DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU AIN'T TELLING ME? THAT'S ALL. I KNEW THAT HE KNEW SOMETHING, AND HE WAS SCARED. AND THEN TRELL DISAPPEARS. NOBODY CAN REACH HIM. HE BECOMES M.I.A. I'M THINKING TRELL RAN AWAY BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID OF WHAT RALPH WOULD DO TO HIM NOW THAT I KNOW ABOUT THE DRUG DEAL. I WAS SITTING AT MY HOUSE. AND FOR SOME REASON, I WAS JUST SO UNSETTLED. AND I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO BE IN MY BROTHER'S SPACE. FOR SEVEN MONTHS, I REALLY DID NOT GO INTO MY BROTHER'S ROOM UNLESS I HAD TO. SO I DROVE MY MOTHER'S HOUSE. IN HIS ROOM, I ALWAYS KEPT A BATTERY-OPERATED CANDLE LIT. THE HOUSE WAS QUIET. IT WAS DARK. I OPENED THE DOOR TO MY MOM'S HOUSE, AND ACTUALLY WENT STRAIGHT TO MY BROTHER'S ROOM. MY BROTHER'S CLOTHES STILL HAD HIS SCENT, STILL SMELLED LIKE HIM. AND I TOLD HIM, YOU KNOW, "DAVON, I LOVE YOU. I'M YOUR SISTER. I'M GONNA ALWAYS LOOK OUT FOR YOU." "IF YOU'RE NOT ALIVE, SHOW ME." AND THEN I RECEIVED A CALL FROM MY HUSBAND. HELLO? Baby, it's Maurice. They found Trell. He was arrested for armed robbery. -His arraignment is next week. -I NEED TO BE THERE. TRELL ROBBED THE MOVIE THEATER THAT HE WAS WORKING AT. HE KNEW THE MANAGER'S ROUTINE. HE WAITED FOR THE MANAGER TO COME IN. HE PULLED A GUN AND TOLD HER TO GIVE HIM THE MONEY. WHEN HE WALKED IN TO THE COURTROOM, HE LOOKED AT ME. AND HE WAS ESCORTED OVER, AND HE SAT DOWN WITH HIS LAWYER. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOUR HONOR, I'D LIKE TO PLEAD GUILTY TO ROBBING THAT MOVIE THEATER. AND I WANT TO CONFESS, TOO, TO WITNESSING THE MURDER OF MY BEST FRIEND, DAVON BUCKMAN. HE LOOKED AT ME, AND HE DROPPED HIS HEAD. YOU SEE, I WAS THERE WHEN RALPH FLEMMING SHOT HIM. TRELL'S BECOME SO CLOSE TO OUR FAMILY. BUT HE'S BEEN LYING TO US FOR SEVEN MONTHS. AND NOW I KNOW HE'S THE ONE PERSON WHO KNOWS THE TRUTH. AFTER SEVEN MONTHS OF WORKING WITH MY FAMILY TO FIND MY MISSING BROTHER, DAVON, HIS BEST FRIEND TRELL CONFESSED TO WITNESSING HIS MURDER. THE DETECTIVES SAID THAT TRELL'S STORY IS CONSIDERED HEARSAY UNLESS HE CAN LEAD THEM TO DAVON'S BODY. WHERE'S THE BODY? RALPH WAS DRIVING. I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE WE WERE GOING. DID YOU DUMP IT SOMEWHERE? DID YOU GO TO A DUMPSTER, A BACK ALLEY SOMEWHERE? I JUST -- I JUST REMEMBER IT SMELLED BAD. UH, IT SMELLED HORRIBLE. IT WAS A DUMP. A DUMP. YOU MEAN LIKE A LANDFILL WHERE THEY PUT ALL THE TRASH, RIGHT? WHICH ONE? DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING -- ANY ROUTES YOU TOOK, ANY LANDMARKS? THERE WAS A GAS STATION. -IT WAS A HESS STATION. -A HESS STATION. GOOD. SIT TIGHT. YO, GET A CAR READY! ABBEVILLE LANDFILL IS ABOUT 155 ACRES. SO IT WAS A LOT OF AREA FOR THEM TO COVER. HOW'S IT GOING? AND THEN THIS GENTLEMAN WORKING AT THE LANDFILL TOLD THEM THAT HE REMEMBERS STEPPING IN A HOLE AND SMELLING A FOUL SMELL. -LET'S GO. -OKAY. ON THE FIRST DIG, HE PULLS UP A BLACK TRASH BAG. AND INITIALLY, THEY'RE THINKING, "LANDFILL, BLACK TRASH BAGS -- NOTHING ABNORMAL." BUT SOMETHING TOLD THEM TO OPEN IT. AND WHEN THEY OPENED IT... ...THEY FOUND REMAINS, MY BROTHER'S REMAINS. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? THAT'S A CORONER'S REPORT. WE FOUND THE BODY, TRELL. AND ACCORDING TO THAT, DAVON WASN'T SHOT. SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL US THE REAL STORY? ♪ I'M LEAVIN' WITH A HONEY TONIGHT ♪ ♪ SHE GON' SEE WHAT SHE LIKE ♪ ♪ AND SHE GON' LIKE THAT I'M GOOD ON MIKES ♪ ♪ I GOT SOME ICE ON ME LIKE I PLAY HOCKEY ♪ ♪ DRUNK LIKE A ZOMBIE, TALKIN' LIKE ROCKY ♪ ♪ BUT I SEE YOU WATCHIN' ME ♪ Davon there with you? -YEAH. -GOOD. KEEP HIM THERE. WE'RE COMING OVER. THEM GIRLS JUST BE CRAZY, MAN. MAN, AIN'T YOU LEARNED NOTHING YET? YOU DON'T LET 'EM UNDER YOUR SKIN. COME ON. IT'S YOUR TURN. LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT. ♪ YOU GOT THE GREEN LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT ♪ YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO, MAN? I'M GONNA TAKE A COUPLE GUYS AND GO BACK TO RALPH'S HOUSE. YOU KNOW, REALLY STAND MY GROUND AND GET MY MONEY BACK. NAH, MAN, I THINK, UH -- I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST LAY LOW. TRELL CAME TO DAVON AND STARTED STABBING HIM. MY BROTHER WAS FIGHTING. HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE. TRELL CONTINUED TO STAB HIM MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE HEAD, IN THE FACE. THE ACTUAL WOUND THAT KILLED HIM -- TRELL STABBED HIM IN THE CHEST BETWEEN THIRD AND FOURTH RIB AND PENETRATED THE HEART. TRELL SAW A MOMENT WHERE HE COULD PROVE HIS LOYALTY TO RALPH BY SHOWING HIM, "I'M NOT A SNITCH AND I CAN SHOW YOU BY KILLING DAVON, BY KILLING MY OWN FRIEND." TRELL THEN TAKES MY BROTHER'S BODY, TAKES HIM IN THE BATHROOM. HE POURS BLEACH AND VINEGAR ON THE BODY. AND THEN HE PROCEEDS TO TAKE AN ELECTRICAL SAW AND DISMEMBER HIS BODY. HE ALLOWED HIM TO SIT IN THE BATHTUB FOR 24 HOURS, I GUESS TO ALLOW THE BLOOD TO DRAIN OUT OR WHATEVER HIS LOGIC WAS FOR THAT. I HAVE NO IDEA. AFTER 24 HOURS, HE BAGS MY BROTHER'S REMAINS INTO THREE TRASH BAGS. THEY THREW A BAG OF REMAINS IN A DUMPSTER AND BURIED TWO TRASH BAGS OF MY BROTHER'S REMAINS IN ABBEVILLE LANDFILL. AND HE GOES ON WITH HIS LIFE AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED. AFTER TRELL CONFESSED, THE POLICE HAD WHAT THEY NEEDED TO FIND AND ARREST EVERYONE INVOLVED IN DAVON'S MURDER. THE WHOLE TIME IN LOOKING FOR MY BROTHER, WANTING ANSWERS, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON HE TALKED TO, THE PERSON THAT COMMITTED THE MURDER WAS WITH ME. HE WAS PUTTING OUT FLYERS. OH, MY GOODNESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELPING OUT. HE WAS HOLDING MY NEPHEW. HE SHARED IN THE MOST INTIMATE MOMENTS WITH ME AND MY FAMILY. FOR SEVEN MONTHS, I FOUGHT. I DIDN'T SLEEP. ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS FINDING HIM. AND I NEVER ACCEPTED, I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I WOULDN'T GET TO SEE HIM AGAIN. I JUST KNEW THAT BIG SISTER WAS GOING TO COME AND SAVE THE DAY AGAIN, AND... I, ONCE AGAIN, WAS GONNA BRING HIM HOME AND BE THE BIG SISTER THAT FIXED EVERYTHING LIKE I NORMALLY DO. AND, UM, I KNEW THIS WAS SOMETHING I COULDN'T FIX.
