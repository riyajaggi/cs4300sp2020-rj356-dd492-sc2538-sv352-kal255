 [narrator] It's 11:59 p.m. December 9th, 1993. In one minute, a PC game will be uploaded to a newly popular platform called the internet. [man] There were hundreds of people on the server and they were dying to get this game. [computer bleeps] [narrator] The game was Doom.  [man] Everyone was initiating the file transfer at the same time, so the server just crashed. It was the game that everybody had been waiting for, evidently.

 [man] It's a dark and scary broken military base that's been invaded by demons from hell. There's a dark environment, a light is strobing, demons are coming at you, and you just see silhouettes and fireballs coming toward you. [explosions] We wanted to scare the crap out of you. And nobody had ever seen anything like it before. [narrator] This is John Romero... game designer turned legend... [chainsaw buzzes] ...for freaking out a generation of gamers. [Romero] We wanted to make something dark and scary

 {\an8}and so we released one of the most violent video games that's ever been made. [narrator] He had opened the door to a new era of gaming... -[groaning] -[gunshots] ...where players could enter, explore, and play against each other. And it came at a pivotal moment when both computers and consoles were about to enter a new dimension. Romero's machine of choice... was the PC. It started in 1989 when Romero began making games for a subscription service called Gamer's Edge. [Romero] Every month you would get a disc for whatever computer that you were subscribing for and on that disc would be a bunch of random stuff. Whether you like it or not, you're getting it, and hopefully there'll be a game or something fun on it. Twenty-two-year-old Romero paired up with another young hotshot programmer named John Carmack to make games that were actually worth it for the subscriber. I asked him, "What is it that you want to do on this game, since we're going to make it together? What are you interested in?" He said, "I'm interested in graphics and, like, the architecture of the games." And I said, "Okay, I'll do the game designs and the levels and programming and stuff that you don't like." [narrator] Romero had a partner in crime. Now they needed the perfect lair for their team to code in. Gamer's Edge was at a fluorescent light company, which to me is non-creative light. I prefer darkness. [heavy metal music playing] But I got a room at the office  and we made our environment that we wanted to work in. It was a dark cave. We had a window that we could let some sunlight in, but we hated that too. We had a Nintendo in the corner that was just playing Life Force, Zelda, Mario 3 on loop. We had our own giant refrigerator in there packed full of drinks. And I had a kick-ass '80s boombox and each person got a whole day to play anything that they wanted. It was mostly metal. [heavy metal music playing] We spent tons of time there. It was funny, because... we were starting to code on our spare time after the normal hours. I mean, this is what we want to do. Nobody's telling us not to do it. This is great. [narrator] Out of that metal-induced mania came the foundation for something truly groundbreaking: smooth side-scrolling on the PC. [Romero] On the Nintendo, side-scrolling was extremely smooth and the PC really couldn't do that because, at the time, the PC graphics just weren't that advanced. {\an8}There were some side-scrolling games that were like Mario clones that moved the screen in chunks, but the chunking doesn't feel real. It takes you out of it. That's as good as it got back then. If we can figure out how we can get it smooth horizontally, that's huge. If we can make a Mario-type thing, like... that's unbelievable. So this one night, Carmack decided that he was going to try to do it. [narrator] That night, he'd take a trip... [distorted voice] ...through the mushroom kingdom. Nah, not that mushroom kingdom. This one. I came in the next day at ten o'clock. They put a little demo on my desk  called Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement. Dangerous Dave is a game that I had made the month before. So I was like, "Hmm, they must have been doing something last night." So I put it in the computer and ran it. The screen starts up with Super Mario Brothers 3 with Dangerous Dave on the screen. And he runs across the screen and the whole screen smoothly scrolls. I could not believe that this was on a PC. I could not believe that he got it working. No one has done this. This is the first time this has happened on a PC. [narrator] In a single night, Carmack figured out something no one else had and it opened up a whole new world of possibilities. [Romero] It was validating the PC as an actual game-playing machine. And I was like, "This technology is big, it's huge. We need to start a company and make our own game." [narrator] Romero saw that the PC could compete with the gaming consoles of the time. But even in the world of Nintendo, there was still a limit to how deep a player could go. Up to that point, Nintendo titles played out in two dimensions. Run left, run right, jump up, jump down. So far, they hadn't figured out how to place the player inside the game from the first-person perspective with 3D polygonal graphics. Meanwhile, over in the UK, a brash high school dropout named Dylan Cuthbert was spinning his wheels on the idea. [Cuthbert] I left school when I was 17. {\an8}I applied for a job at a company called Argonaut Software. {\an8}At the time, it was a very leading-edge 3D games company. [narrator] Argonaut was trying to make a name for themselves among the gaming giants, and they were counting on 3D to make it happen. [Cuthbert] Immediately I was thrown into making a game for Game Boy, {\an8}a 3D game, sort of fly everywhere, shooting kind of game. [narrator] Making a 3D game for the Game Boy was unheard of, but that wasn't the only problem facing the team. Nintendo fiercely guarded their trade secrets. So if you wanted to legally develop games on any of Nintendo's systems, you needed a permission slip, which Argonaut didn't have. But they went forward with the project anyway, just to see if it could be done. [Cuthbert] And we had no official dev kits, no official license, nothing at all. We just had a Game Boy. We just kind of ripped everything apart and just attached wires, and basically hacked in the connections on the chip to come out so we could actually give it different data. [narrator] Dylan figured out how to code a wireframe-based space demo that ran in 3D. That's how we knocked up the initial 3D sort of demo on the Game Boy, um, very unofficially. So we kind of got away with it. [narrator] Or so they thought. [ominous music playing] Six months into that project, it got seen by someone from Nintendo. [narrator] Hacking Nintendo could mean trouble, pretty deep legal trouble. But, more than anything, Nintendo seemed curious. [Cuthbert] Suddenly my boss says, "The people who made the Game Boy don't believe that... that 3D can run on the Game Boy. So, in two weeks you're flying to Japan." I think I was 18. I didn't have a passport, so I had to go and quickly get a passport. And, really, without thinking about it, I just got on the plane with my boss. The next morning, we went to Nintendo and we're sitting there in this big white room. And suddenly about 30 Nintendo staff just come in from the other side. And they're all wearing Nintendo jackets. And we're kind of there like this with our t-shirts and jeans. And they all sit down, basically a whole bunch of, like, luminaries... [chuckles] ...on the other side of the table. And there's me, an 18-year-old kid, basically, showing them what I'd done on the Game Boy. And they said, "Oh, this is amazing. Okay, we're going to sign this game up." [narrator] So, instead of a lawsuit, Argonaut got a contract to officially make their game. But that wasn't all. Nintendo star designer Shigeru Miyamoto had another secret project up his sleeve: their next generation gaming console. [Cuthbert] Miyamoto brought over this, like, pre-release Super Nintendo. And, like, with no-- I mean, I hadn't signed an NDA. There's no security or anything. And he said, "Well, this is where we're trying to do 3D. Is this something that Argonaut could help us with?" [narrator] It was too late to change the hardware for the Super Nintendo console, so Dylan fell back on what he knew best, hacking, and proposed putting a chip that could handle 3D inside the cartridges. Miyamoto's eyes kind of lit up, and that kind of began the super effects chip. [narrator] The super effects chip allowed Miyamoto to envision a whole new perspective. He had already mastered 2D games like Mario and Zelda. Now, he'd pair up with Dylan to create a 3D experience, bringing players inside the world of the game. But, back in the US, Romero and team were already full steam ahead on 3D. They say that all work and no play makes Johnny a dull boy… [narrator] Cracking the Nintendo code on the PC was just the beginning for Romero and his team. {\an8}We're already way past that. [narrator] It empowered them to quit their jobs and form their own company, Id Software. And by 1992, they had taken their newfound smooth-moving side-scrolling tech and turned it inside out... {\an8}[newscaster] It's three-dimensional. It's texture mapped. {\an8}It's Wolfenstein, {\an8}one of the hottest-selling computer games in the world. {\an8}[narrator] ...creating a hit game and popularizing a new perspective:  {\an8}the first-person shooter. {\an8}We just decided that we wanted to make something more serious in 3D, and not do the side-scrolling stuff anymore. So Wolfenstein 3D came out on May 5th of 1992, to instant massive success. People loved blowing away Nazis as you're trying to shoot your way out of the castle. {\an8}It was a 3D game going at 70 frames a second, {\an8}in full color with real digital sound for the first time. CPUs were just fast enough to make Wolfenstein run fast. And so, we were just on the edge of technology. [narrator] In just a few short years, Romero and his team built a successful company and transformed the personal computer into an immersive and action-packed gaming platform. These were the building blocks for their ultimate masterpiece. Basically, with every game that we made, we were just trying to do something new and different and better with each game.  And that's it. That's all we cared about. So we were starting to think about what our next game would be, and we wanted to improve the technology and make the game even more immersive and more exciting. So the bullet-point list that we came up with  that was going to go in the game was just, like, super ambitious.  We wanted diminished lighting... [narrator] For creepiness. -[Romero] ...high speed... -[narrator] For realistic movement. [Romero] ...most importantly, multi-player functionality. [narrator] For playing with all your friends. We need to have the ultimate ultimate, which is let people play each other on a network or over the modem. -[dial-up tone] -[narrator] Hold on for a second. Hear that? If you're Romero's target demographic in the '90s, that's the sweet sound of a computer connecting to the internet. Back then, you'd hook your computer to the telephone landline, dial up your modem... [keypad tones beeping] ...and wait... [dial-up tone] and wait... and wait. [computer voice] Welcome. [narrator] And if someone had to make a call, you were booted. -[computer voice] Goodbye. -[boy] Mom, get off the phone! [narrator] It was all new, and people were still figuring it out. Once you've learned how to get online yourselves, you'll start seeing web pages everywhere. Can we do something fun? Maybe play a game? Let's go to the Yahooligans home page and find a game! [Romero] There were games that were multiplayer on modems but they weren't games that were high-speed that were networked. [narrator] At the time, computers could connect online and mostly just play slow, simple games like... War, Golf, strategy games that played out in turns. [Romero] That was the limitation.  And I was thinking about how cool it would be to finally play an action game with somebody that's on a completely different computer, running around and shooting each other online. Carmack got to work on figuring out simultaneous remote gameplay. And Tom Cruise came up with their game title. [Romero] There's a movie called The Color of Money.  And Tom Cruise is in a pool hall and he's about to play against some guy and he brought his own cue stick. So, the guy comes up and he's like... What you got in there? [Romero] And Tom Cruise looks down, he goes... Doom. [laughs] And it was like, wow, what a great name. Come on, boy. Let's play. Yeah, let's play. [narrator] And with absolutely nothing programmed yet, Romero got to work on the press release. [Romero] We put a press release out just saying how awesome this game is gonna be, which is crazy, because nobody does that. You put a press release out when you release something. So it was nuts to even say that before you create it. We didn't care. That's what we were like then. Even worse, the press release said this game will be the loss of productivity around the world when it comes out.  [narrator] With that, the team at Id inadvertently gave themselves a hard deadline and a lot of hype. And then we had to work like hell that year to make it. [narrator] Romero was confident their idea would have mass appeal. But for Dylan in Japan, Nintendo's attempt to get into 3D was all under seal. Behind closed doors, he was preparing to show that the super effects chip was up to the task. [Cuthbert] We showed them a demo, where you kind of fly around in all 3D. It had, like, sort of missile trails. It was actually quite a nice little demo. [narrator] But not everybody thought so. [Cuthbert] Miyamoto couldn't really get his head around the fly everywhere thing. He didn't like the fact that the player has to really think about not just here, but like all around. So Miyamoto said,  "Go back for Christmas, you know, everybody, and then come back in the New Year, and we'll carry on development, and I'll see what I can think up to kind of help this." So we got back from our Christmas break and Miyamoto came to us and he said, "I had a great idea over the New Year." Every year, the Japanese go for a sort of pilgrimage to shrines. They call it Hatsumode. Miyamoto went to the Fushimi Inari shrine very near where Nintendo was at that time. And it has these thousands of vermilion-colored gates Miyamoto said, "I was moving through the gates and I thought,  wouldn't it be great if we just were flying through these gates, enjoying that thrill of going through things rather than just shooting things all the time." And so we went, "Oh, okay, that is actually a pretty interesting concept." [narrator] Miyamoto had discovered a fix for his problem. By allowing the gamer to fly through gates, he could control the action. so the player would not have to worry about what was behind them. It was the foundation of what would become an iconic Nintendo game. [Cuthbert] Something interesting is the Fushimi Inari shrine itself the word inari means "fox." And so that's basically where Star Fox was born. It all really originated from that walk that he had. [narrator] But it would take more than a walk at the shrine for these groundbreaking visuals to take off. So Dylan called in his wingman, Giles Goddard. {\an8}I'm Giles Goddard. I was a programmer on Star Fox. {\an8}Giles is one of the first people I met when I joined Argonaut Software.  His personality is very... dry. Dylan is extremely driven. -Very droll. -Stubborn. Very... different. Argued a lot. [laughs] [narrator] And this dynamic duo was ready to take Kyoto by storm. [Goddard] Twenty years ago, Japan was a very different place. There were very few foreign tourists, very few foreigners at all. It was scary, but it was fun because we were 18, and we'd just been on a first-class flight from London, all expenses paid. So we just thought we were rock stars. [narrator] Two blokes in Kyoto, all expenses paid. What could go wrong? Pretty cool. Look at the sign, it's still broken. [Cuthbert] There was a bar called Backgammon. Grungy and gritty and dirty, you know, just a lot of fun. Do you remember the days when, if you saw a foreigner come at you, you'd wave? [Cuthbert] About 25 years ago? We had little white dictionaries that we'd always had in our back pockets. [Cuthbert] We'd take them with us around bars and use those to try and talk to people.  -And also with plenty of drinking... -Cheers! -Chin-chin. -Bottoms up. ...our Japanese gets smoother and smoother. [speaking Japanese] At least, we think it does. [narrator] And when Dylan and Giles did squeeze in work, they found they were truly outsiders in the office. [Goddard] They'd never had anybody outside of Nintendo working in the building. They actually made a separate office for us, in one room, on our own, basically segregated out. [Cuthbert] And the only place in the office where they allowed Miyamoto to smoke was in the area where we were. [laughs] He'd light up behind us and he's, like, smoking away. And we're, like, programming away, and we're like, "Oh, he's back again. Oh, no." [laughs] So we'd be trying to implement something quite interesting,  and then, he just starts talking about trees or something. Just something completely out there. But we realized after a while  that that's actually the reason why he's so much a creative genius is because his brain is kind of thinking about all these different things at the same time. [narrator] And one of the tasks with Star Fox that Miyamoto was so focused on was the perspective of the camera. In a 2D game, the camera moves are simple. The screen syncs its movement with the character. Left, right, and so on. But things get a little more complicated in 3D. [Goddard] That was the biggest feature of 3D, the ability to move the camera.  And it was Miyamoto's main job to figure out the camera. If the camera’s right behind the Arwing, it would feel like you weren't turning, but if it was fixed it would feel like it's going all over the place. You've got to have a lag between the camera and the ship movement, otherwise it feels like you're not turning. But you can't do too much of that. Otherwise the player feels like things are moving too much, and they feel disorientated. It's a balance game between looking cool and playability. [narrator] So programming on Star Fox was happening. Ships were flying. Lasers were lasering. It was all coming together. And then the art department got involved. [Cuthbert] For a long time on the project, it really was just like an old school Star Wars-style, kind of, a little bit more hardcore. No... people. But Nintendo was known for its cute, family-friendly characters and that sacred shrine that Miyamoto loved so much was dedicated to… a fox. [Cuthbert] Suddenly the artists at Nintendo started coming up with all these cute little character designs, fluffy sort of animals and things like that. To be honest, I thought they were quite lame. [laughs] [Cuthbert] It felt a bit odd because they're animals,  and we're like, "Why are animals flying spacecraft? I don't know what's going on here." But one thing that Miyamoto really instilled in us all is that we take a step back, kind of look at it and go, "Okay, no, this needs to be made more fun." He approaches things from, not just the player point of view, but also from how he can design the experience. And I think that was a pretty good lesson for all of us. {\an8}It did slowly grow on us.  {\an8}And we didn't realize how much everything came together at the end,  and it just became this, like, really full-on experience.  {\an8}[narrator] The camera movement, the cute animals, the gates. Combined, they created the trademark Nintendo experience, {\an8}but in 3D. {\an8}Fox McCloud could chat with his sidekicks Peppy Hare, Falco Lombardi, and Slippy Toad to present mission objectives and to make the game more engaging.  [Cuthbert] One of the unique things about Star Fox was that it was on a console because, up until that point, there hadn't really been any 3D games on consoles. [announcer] The first and only game powered by the Super FX microchip. [narrator] The combination of Dylan and Giles' coding wizardry and Nintendo's design magic worked. The game would go onto sell over four million copies {\an8}and blast Nintendo into the 3D realm. {\an8}[announcer] Only for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. [narrator] But pretty soon, 3D wouldn't be enough. {\an8}Back in the US, another group of young rule breakers {\an8}would take the first-person perspective and push it even further.  [Romero] After putting out the press release, we knew that Doom was gonna be a pretty big game  because we had people calling the office to ask when is the game going to come out? [man 1] Yo, where's Doom? -[woman] Is Doom out? -[man 2] What's Doom all about? And so, like, people were so excited, like, it was crazy. [narrator] Romero's press release promised gamers they'd be "knee-deep in the dead" before the end of the year. Now, all they had to do was... make the game. The team that made Doom was pretty small. It was just five people, so it was a lot of work. Like, what is Doom? And the first major idea was that we would be fighting a demon invasion, uh, somewhere. These are some sketches of what levels could possibly look like.  How 'bout we have walls with blood dripping down them,  or maybe there's some organic walls in hell, you know,  maybe that's what the engine could render.  This here... this is one of my favorite pages. It has some original ideas for demons. Highly original ideas. Some of them are pretty funny. It's like, what's going on... here? [laughs] You know, if they actually looked this way in Doom, uh... history would've been a little bit different. [laughs] We eventually decided that you'd be space marine in the future on a military base and this is like a research thing gone bad, and here come the demons.  [narrator] But the story was just a backdrop for cyberdemons, exploding chunks of flesh and the insane weapons. We wanted to have conventional weapons that the players could totally get into. Like shotguns, chainsaws.  Why wouldn't you want to chainsaw a demon? And just like a fist, just punching demons in the face, but then we could add a couple of spacey-type weapons to kind of spice it up. So that's where we came up with the plasma gun, and we really liked the idea of shooting rockets at demons. That was just nuts. [narrator] And then there was the BFG. The B is for big, the G is for gun. You can fill in the rest. And then the BFG was the ultimate weapon. If you can get a hold of that and enough cells to power it, you can destroy everything. [narrator] In the fall of '93, Romero and the team were approaching their launch. And Carmack finally figured out  how to let players battle each other over the network in multiplayer mode. When Carmack got the game working between two computers, where he's shooting one computer and the other guys getting hit, it was like, "Oh, there it is! It's happening!" [narrator] That’s right. Strategy in Doom would completely change in multi-player mode. Instead of battling demons, you could battle your friends. When there's another player in the game, it's totally different than playing monsters. People play so differently than the AI. They're luring you.  They're hiding.  And that is a real challenge, you know, playing somebody else.  After seeing the characters shooting each other, I was thinking, "What would we call this?" It's like a cage match kind of thing. Except you're killing the other person over and over. It's like a death match. "Deathmatch is great. That sounds cool. I think I'll name it that." [narrator] Romero knew the game was going to be cool. But he still wanted to make sure everyone got hooked. So he and his team decided to give players a free sample. Shareware in games was to take a game and split it into three parts,  and the first one is fully free, as a downloadable file, but if you wanted more, then you would order the other two parts of the game on diskettes. It was a pretty revolutionary marketing idea at the time, and it worked really well. We knew that at the end of the day that we would be able to make money because, number one, we believed it was the best game in the world and because it was so good, we believed people would want to buy the rest of it. You know, that they would want to get all three episodes because playing those first nine levels is gonna get old at some point. You're going to want the rest of the story. So finally, when the game was about to be released, the server was packed full of people who can't wait to download the game.  And I'm like, "Oh, my God, yes!" [narrator] That's how kids in computer labs around the country found themselves at midnight on December 10th, 1993, ready to download the first chapter of Doom. Everyone was initiating the file transfer at the same time.  So the server just crashed. And then they brought the server back up, all those people reconnected. They did it again and the whole thing crashed. But then, people started to copy it onto other servers all around the world, sharing with each other, and then everybody started playing. {\an8}[narrator] Online multiplayer games would become a pretty big deal. {\an8}Deathmatch and online game play changed everything. -[man] Oh, what? -[man 2] Ah! [narrator] Players could connect over a network and interact, -Look at the death. -...immersing themselves in a new world... -[man] Boom! -...but with each other. [Romero] For the first time, you can play in a high-speed 3D world where you're blowing your friends apart. -God damn it! -[laughs] It's really fun to play against each other in Deathmatch, and it influenced everybody in wanting to make games. [narrator] And then the guys at Id handed players the keys to their kingdom. We fully opened the game. Then we gave out the information on the way that levels were created. [narrator] Doom was opened up to modding. Tech-savvy players could now replace the existing characters, sound effects, textures, you name it, {\an8}with their own creations. [Romero] People starting to make new graphics, new weapons  and new sounds for stuff. And it was basically everything that you see in the game can be changed. But we didn't allow anyone to modify Doom if they didn't buy it. [laughs] So if you have the shareware version of Doom you can't run levels or mods or anything. So that was actually kind of a way of forcing people to buy it. But also, players want to be creative. It's a lot easier to modify than to try and make a whole new thing.  So, letting people mod a game kind of gives them a taste of what it's like to make a game. And now the game, you know, fits them better. Doom was put in the hands of players, and they made it their own. The game lives on forever. [man 1] Oh, what? [man 2] Oh, no! [narrator] In a way, Romero's story is the story of the entire video game industry. Each new game was built upon the foundation crafted by the game before. And because of that, it can be hard to remember the humble beginnings of what would become this billion-dollar entertainment juggernaut. But there's one man who remembers. -[laughing] -This man, the so-called godfather of video games, Nolan Bushnell. In my mind, there is a huge payoff  {\an8}for being... {\an8}indisputably number one  in whatever you do. It was 1964 when Bushnell stumbled upon an idea that would spark a new industry. I was in college, and one of my fraternity brothers said, "Hey. Meet me at the engineering building at midnight  and I'm going to blow your socks off." I said, "Huh?" You know. Always willing to have my socks blown off, I showed up. And he had jammed the lock on the computer center, and we went in and, for the rest of that evening, played Spacewar!. And I was mesmerized. [narrator] Spacewar! was unlike anything Bushnell had seen before. It had been invented two years earlier by a bunch of kids at MIT who were part of the tech model railroad club.  They were the original hackers. In fact, they coined the term. And, just for fun, ended up transforming a computer  into an entirely new contraption: the video game. [Bushnell] You'd fly around and you could shoot a missile. And you could push a button and thrust. In order to slow down, you had to reverse thrust in the opposite direction, totally followed Newton's first law. And it was really fun. [narrator] Spacewar! was an underground hit on any college campus with a computer that could run it. And I knew that if I could put a coin slot on that screen that it would make money. [narrator] Bushnell saw that video games were for more than just computer nerds. They were for everyone. And so he founded a company called Atari. And... We were off to the races. He was the first in a long line of visionaries. Visionaries who changed the way we play... [Amano in Japanese] We wanted to create an entirely new world. There's really no end once you get started. [narrator in English] ...who dared to fail greatly... [Warshaw] I did my best. I tried to do what I could. I needed a mountain to climb, and I felt like I climbed the mountain. ...who fought for their place to exist... Anyone of color often has to justify themselves. Video games remove all those physical differences. ...who were compelled by imagination... I was so driven to do this, and I kept thinking, "Why?" ...and wouldn't take no for an answer. [laughs] What we did back then was ahead of its time, but the time is now. [Mario] Here we go! [narrator] It was a monumental era, one that defined video games as a place to get lost, a place to become someone different,  and go to faraway lands.  But, most importantly, {\an8}it defined that any player could be a game creator. {\an8}So now that technology can fully blur the line between fantasy and reality, the question is... where will we go next?
