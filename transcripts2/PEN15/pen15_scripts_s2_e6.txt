The play is an original piece, which means I wrote it. And for you guys as the actors, my whole thing, my mantra, it's gonna be real and honest. If you're not real and honest with me, if you're not real and honest with yourselves, and if you're not real and honest with each other, then this whole thing is bullshit. Now, there are four of you in this ensemble and by the end of this rehearsal, there will be three. So who here doesn't belong? Come on. Ian, who doesn't belong? [snapping] ‐ Um, I'm, um‐‐ GREG: Come on. ‐ Sorry, it's just hard. GREG: Real and honest. ‐ Um, I think I would pick... [sighs] Maya. It's just, in every drama class since third grade, you haven't, um, showed anything that I've noticed. I don't think you have, like, "it" charisma. You're just kind of wild and out of control.
