 I think we're a little underdressed. So, who's in charge now ? Bet it's your best boy Quinn. Here we go. Hello, may I help you with something ? - What event is this ? - This is a private event. - Move your car now. - Okay. Thank you. You recognize that driver ? Hey. Did you always know I was PBI ? Milla, tell me something. The night we met. How come you were in that bar ?

 I'd spent the whole day looking at your file. And then I saw you on the streets and... I don't know, it felt like... What are we gonna do ? Well, whatever's happening, it's happening today. So, we're gonna retrieve the diamonds and stop the exchange. And the CIA know where that's going to happen, you've told them ? They've got our backs. Damn, you can still sleep anywhere. Apparently, it's when I'm at my most pleasant. - What do you come up with ? - Okay. Let's assume that, after they killed Flea, the motorcyclist was supposed to deliver the diamonds to the Qatari Consulate. - Yeah. - You stopped him from doing that. But the exchange would still have taken place. We need to find out who was at the Consulate. Think you can talk to your driver friend ? Burger's no friend. We haven't seen each other since I left the unit. Maybe it's time the two of you caught up. Right now you and I both know the only way to secure the stadium is to cancel the game. No, we can't afford another humiliation like that. With your help we can shut this down long before tonight's kick off. Intelligence suggests there are just three bombers. Three men. You're the fucking CIA, Bruno ! You want Daoud more than we do. This is your way to him. They should shut down the docks as well. You're assuming the weapon isn't already on South African soil. How come Allajna moved out the night before the kick-off ? Excuse me. Don't you people have work to do ? Raj ? Tell me. Do you have any idea where the Allajna went to ? - None so far. - You're right. Why did they leave what they thought was a safe house so far in advance of the attack ? And just before we moved in ? You really think we have a mole ? If we do, it's not the CIA they are talking to. Look at this. This this is from yesterday. See those hand movements ? It's a prayer for the dead. But Osman is still alive. Maybe, but she has no intention of seeing him again. Okay, also look. There's this. It's small, it's a moment, but... See that ? You think she knows the camera is there ? She's looking straight at us. Okay, I'll ask Jessica to pull together whatever we have on Teliha. Everyone, listen up. This evening's match will go ahead. Chief Burzynski has kindly agreed to put the CIA Station's resources at our disposal. I trust you can handle this. - Quinn, they knew we were coming. - What ? Allajna. They knew we were watching them, that we were gonna make a move. Goodness, Raj, you sound just like Janina. Listen to me. Our only job is to get to the terrorists before they get anywhere near the Stadium. That is all we gotta do. Okay ? - We got a new car. - Okay. The phone you took from the dockside diner. You still have it ? Look, we can't allow ourselves to be tracked. Okay ? Give it to me. What if we get into trouble ? It's standard procedure. You better trust me on this. John. Lemmer ? See you gave up the gym subscription. I see you're still on a hunger strike. So... What do you want here ? You were driving last night ? Some official function of the Qatari Consulate... Were you there ? No. But you were. I was driving David, and right now I miss my bed, and I'm tired ! I get it, I just wanted to know who else was there ? I don't know ! The usual, ministers, businessmen. - Mostly Arabs and some few Japanese. - Did you see this guy ? Most of the time I was outside. You know how it is. Did you see anything strange ? Fuck, drivers you didn't recognize ? - It's important, John. - Don't you dare. Don't you dare pull the "for old times' sake" bullshit with me. - Look man... I don't need this. - Okay. Anything unusual ? Like I said, Lemmer. The usual. The big shots. Good old boys from the bad old days. That's it ! Who ? - Mostert. - What ? Doctor Henrik Mostert. - Mostert was there ? - Yeah. - Is he sure ? - He's fucking sure. Burger and I spent weeks on duty at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, watching that say fokal and get his amnesty. If Burger says he was there, he was there. - He was on the radar last year ? - You know he was. But he's been teaching at the University for the past fifteen years, more. All sins forgiven. I mean he even taught Nkosi's son ! I wonder if the students know that their lecturer used to weaponize cholera for the Apartheid regime. Although locating our man, Suleiman Daoud, is a primary objective for this office, right now our focus is on what we believe, from the surveillance footage and the evidence gathered from the inside the house, to be a three-man team targeting Cape Town Stadium. Target A, Abdullah Garba, Target B, Hassan Hamedi and Target C, Barkatullah Rayan. Now, this team has prepared themselves ritually, so we need to go into this with the mind that we are dealing with a suicide team. Now, the police have established a perimeter around the stadium and are providing aerial cover. We will screen everyone. I'm talking from road blocks to the station, and again at Cape Town Stadium Gates, we screen everyone. Right, is there anything you'd like to add, Bruno ? Only that our support teams will be relocating all organizational staff here, to the PBI offices. Right. Thank you. Alright, everybody, let's get to work. Thank you. What is this place ? Milla, do you know how to use a gun ? I used to shoot targets on my father's farm. Very simple. Up, safety on. Down, safety off. Release button for the magazine. Empty. Rack the slide, lean into it and... Squeeze the trigger. Single shot each time. Milla, I'm hoping you won't have to use this, but we have to be prepared. - What about your team ? - The team will be there. But I need to know you're safe. And afterwards ? What happens to us ? I'm gonna have to leave the country. What do you say you come with me ? What ? Milla, I want you to come with me. Yes... - Yes ? - Yeah, okay. There's just something I have to do first. Okay ? Mostert's boosting his pension, selling God knows what horror for blood diamonds. We'll pick him up. But we have to go after Daoud first. Whatever Mostert was selling is in his hands. Fucking one year on and we're still chasing this mess. WMD's on the open market, a major attack on the cards... Yeah. It's exactly the same as last year. Excuse me, sorry. As you requested, sir. Wait, shouldn't you be heading to the Stadium ? Gotta get this feed up first. Anyway, that's the updated file on Teliha. Do you ever feel like you're becoming invisible ? Really great job, Jess. Really... Excellent work. As always. What now ? We wait. Come. Brother, please, take the girl upstairs. It has been a long time. It's good to be back in the fight. You never left it. Raj ? Teliha and her daughter were seen on Almonda Street twenty minutes ago. Guys, the satellite call you asked us to trace, Langley says it was made from a vessel called the Calgary Star. They only found that out now ? At least we could trace it. It's a passenger liner: Perth, Mumbai, Cape Town, New York. Docked here two days ago. - It's been here for two days ? - You heard. Jessica, pull the passengers and crew list of the Calgary Star. Find someone, anyone who has a link to the cell. On it. I skimmed the research on the wife. She's smart. She's got a first class honors in biological sciences, Phd in London... Did you pick up the date she left London in 2008 ? Do you think you could convince Quinn to pull a team to tail her ? Come on, I doubt it. Okay, I'm outta here. You're in the hot seat. Barend ! - Ma... - Can we talk ? I might be going away for a while. You're never here anyway, so who cares ? It's not the same, Barend please. Where you going ? I can't tell you right now. Take this. - What's this ? - No, don't open it now. Wait until I've gone. Why are you doing this Mom ? I had to see you. Then why don't you come home ? So that's the guy you're leaving with ? So Dad was right. - You're just a whore ! - Barend ! I love you, no matter what ! Tomorrow at ten, yes. I'll bring what I owe you, plus interest. You okay ? Yeah. Let's go. It's all there. Passport, visa and tickets. Are you okay ? Was I not worthy to join them ? You have a very important role to play, Ibrahim. We know the docks are watched. Without you we cannot do this. You are more than worthy. Shaheed saw that and so do I. Will Ablah come over tonight ? Not tonight, my angel. In this jihad, we all have duties, and some of us carry the great burdens of support for our mujahidin and mujahidat. And in return for that sacrifice, I believe we all will one day share in the rewards that await our martyrs. You are not afraid ? No, I'm not, Brother. I am certain. It is time. Come. You had a call. Some kid. He said you must call him back immediately. There's no reply from Quinn or David. We have to let them know that Mostert's involved, and the kind of attack they're facing. - Do you think they'd even listen ? - There's only one way to find out. You drive. I can see why they chose this place. Anything landing here is pretty much invisible. You can spot anyone approaching from the road 200 meters before they see you. The problem, for them and us... Is that there are only two exits. So how do we get out ? I'm gonna be on the breakwater. From there I can control the whole area, land and sea. You think they're coming in by sea ? My gut says whatever they're buying, it's coming from there. And the diamonds are coming in from the city. What if they already made the exchange ? Or they're launching the attack from here ? No... The message said "Exchange. "Granger Bay. 7 pm." This is where it's happening. And where will I be in all of this ? You're gonna be right here. Okay, now you wait for me to open fire from the breakwater. Then all you have to do is let off a few bursts low into the ground in the direction of the gate. Alright ? They'll think they're surrounded. You must follow me. The docks are being watched. It's not safe, yeah ? Jess, slow down. Who is Barend Strachan ? Okay, I've got it. Tell Quinn to meet me at the East Forecourt Service Gate. Then get Raj to tell him. We're about twenty... - Thirty. - Maybe thirty minutes away. What is it ? The exchange is taking place at Granger Bay. - You sure ? - Jess got a tip off. - What time ? - Seven o'clock. Start of the match. It's good. Don't let your mind play tricks on you. Okay, you're gonna feel anxious. You're gonna see danger in every corner, you're gonna think about everything that could go wrong. Don't. Just stick to the plan. Alright, no matter what happens, don't do a thing until you hear me fire. If it all goes to shit, you leave the gun, you walk away. Lucas, stop. - There's no back up coming, is there ? - Milla, we don't have time... I know you're not CIA. A CIA agent doesn't buy guns from a market stall. There's still time to take what we know to others. Milla, I have spent the last fifteen years in places of unimaginable chaos. I haven't survived by putting my trust in anyone else. But I trust you. And as soon as this is done, and it's just you and me, I promise... They will kill you. If I don't get those diamonds, I'm a dead man anyway. If you wanna go, then go. I won't change how I feel about you. I'm going nowhere. - C'mon, Jess, pick up ! - Can't wait. We have to go now. Boss ! - Where's Quinn ? - He's not coming. - What ? - Raj. - Lemmer ? - We need Quinn to know. We think Daoud delivered the diamonds to Henrik Mostert at the Qatari Consulate last night. You think Mostert's involved ? The weapon's biological ? Whatever it is, it was made right here in South Africa. It's Teliha. She was, is a doctor, her research is in biosciences. You have evidence ? It's Jess, she found a connection between her and Daoud, back in her student days when she was in London. It's easy to make a connection between her and Mostert. We have to go. Tell Quinn, once he's dealt with this, to head to Granger Bay. Gotcha. Copy that. The security has Target A in sight. He's coming up stairwell C. The weapon, it might be biological. Then send me all units immediately. Target B exiting the Stadium bus terminal. I need you to divert. Blue unit for 4 intercept. Now ! Go ! - Who are you ? - I'm not alone. He's American. I didn't ask you that, I asked who you are. My name is Lucas Becker, I'm CIA. If you and your men want to leave me here alive you need to listen to me now. We know everything. About Nkunzi, the plot, the plan to exchange the diamonds here. There's no sign of anyone else. Do you think we should call it off ? No. But our crusader here... Mr. Becker needs to start talking. Move ! Listen to me, if you have back up they need to come save you now. Tell me who you are and where your back up is hiding and maybe I won't have to put a bullet through your head. He's in the underpass. Blue unit, go ! Move ! Everybody move ! Out the way ! Move ! Stop right there ! Show me your hands ! Show me your hands ! Your hands now ! Target B in range. We have a clear shot. You ! Put your hands up ! Both hands ! Show me your palm. - I see wires. - Take the shot. Target B is down. Blue unit. Clear the area. Wait for the bomb squad. We might not need them. Last chance. My name is Lucas Becker. And I'm alone. Raj ? What the fuck is going on ? Quinn ? Quinn, you need to listen to me. Hey ! It's a diversion ! They found another empty rucksack at the waterfront. What ? They've got us focused on the stadium and all looking in the wrong direction. - Janina and Lemmer are downstairs... - Lemmer ? Yeah. Janina is with Lemmer and they told me to tell you that whatever's going down, is actually going down at Granger Bay. They're not bringing something into the country. They're gonna use the cruise ship to take something out of the country, and I think it's biological, because somehow Dr. Henrik Mostert's involved. Easy, Mrs. Strachan. Good ? Jess passed on the message you gave your son. It's the wife. Osman's wife is in there. - The weapon's biological. - What do you mean ? The child's the weapon. Teliha needs a carrier. Get her to the boat. - Let the boy go. - What's that ? - Put the gun down. Let him go. - Want him ? Alright. Janina ! Let the child go ! Mrs. Osman ! It's over. Put the child down ! She's my child ! Get away from me ! Please. Put your child down ! It's Nazli, right ? Just put Nazli down, drop the weapon, and step away. Tell them to stay back ! This whole area could be contaminated. Sorry to keep you waiting. Find a way of excusing me from the meeting, but just do be careful what you say about me, because... Keep your eye on Roberts. Comrade Nina. How are you ? How's the child ? The virus didn't have time to incubate too strong. Glad to hear it. I'm sorry I don't have more time, the press are waiting. The estimate is two to three hundred thousand... - Sorry ? - Casualties. In New York. If the child had managed to infect her fellow passengers on the liner. I see. I'm sorry I don't have more time. We arrested Henrik Mostert at 4 am this morning. For selling biological weapons to a terrorist organization. Mostert ? Your friend, Doctor Henrik Mostert. What did he offer you to find him a buyer ? Nina... This is just a bullshit fantasy. You brokered the exchange at the Qatari Consulate. That's why you were there. You told Allajna we were watching them. You fucked me over the last time you tried this, a year ago. I know Pelindaba was you, David. It's been you. All along. Fuck you. Was it just for the money ? Minister. Thank you ! Right sir, ma'am, out the way. Ma'am, sir, please get out the way. Dr. David Masutha ! - Dr. David Masutha. - What's going on here ? You, sir, need to come with us. Please step back. Ma'am, no questions, please. Sir, I need you to back up ! So ? What nonsense have you involved my son in ? I not going to discuss that with you. Who are you working for ? You know the answer to that. No I don't, or I wouldn't have fucking asked you. I'm a journalist. And I don't have to explain myself to you ever again. Come. No. Bitch. He shouldn't talk to you like that. No, he shouldn't. Thank you. That letter you gave me... - Who's Jess ? - A friend. - Do you work together ? - We did. Actually, we still do. How did you know I'd give her the letter ? Because I'm your mother. Fuck. Can you confirm the ID ? Janina. It's not her... The body it's not Flea... She sent her cousin in her place. Have a good trip, ma'am.
