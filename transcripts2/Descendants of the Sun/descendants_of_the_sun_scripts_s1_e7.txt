 (DESCENDANTS OF THE SUN) Synced & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by VIU. Thankfully, you aren't hurt. I've been regretting... not saying goodbye to you before I left on that day. I can't be with you. So, please... be careful. You, too. (EPISODE 7) This is the Taebaek Corps rescue team.

 Is anyone in there? If you are there, knock three times. I think I was wrong. No. If most of the afternoon crew working on the tower... used the east stairway to escape, this should be the search point. We've cut off the gas pipe. How is the situation over there? Well... That place is... a 100 times better than over here. The building is practically intact. And the rubble blocking the entry is only half of what's here.

 Let's start with that side. We can't... because of the falling rocks since it is still collapsing. What falling rocks? It's only a few pebbles. If that scares you that much, how will you manage rescue operations? My goodness. After an earthquake, a standing building is more dangerous. Even if it looks fine from the outside, the inside is unstable due to the shock from the strong earthquake. Thus even a slight vibration from our equipment, can bring about secondary damage and cause more harm. I hear it. Although it's faint, I can definitely hear... the signal from the survivors. Prepare endoscope equipment... and secure images of the inside. Yes, Sir. Oh, my. You're still young to be lacking so much energy. Tap harder. It's so hard. Quickly. Quickly. Safety first. Safety first. Yes, you're right. Safety comes first. I am very sorry. I thought we had built a sturdy building. Who would have thought this would happen? Anyway, hold on a little longer. The people outside are looking for us. Don't you hear something? - Wait. - Do you hear that? I think someone is down there. Who is that? Who is it? Is this the rescue team? Isn't that Manager's voice? Wait. - It is. - Oh, my. - Manager? - Where are you? I think we're right above you. Hold on a little longer. The rescue team is on their way. Here. Over here. We're here. Hurry up, please. There are a lot of wounded people. Quickly. Removing the pile of concrete from the collapsed ceiling, which is blocking the entry, is most crucial. The pulley won't be able to bear the weight. We need to drill through it. Stop talking nonsense. This is a special reinforced concrete. It will take more than two days to drill through concrete that thick. We need to find another way. What are you worried about? There's an easy way. Bring in the heavy equipment. How many times have I told you... that the ground is not firm here so it will be risky for the survivors? Then, look here. Here. Isn't it all right in this office area? You said there weren't any signals from survivors over here. Let's do what we can quickly. I told you there are important documents in the office. Are you telling us to save paperwork... and delay saving people? Hey, you. I think you are mistaken. The person in charge is me who is the chief manager... of the Urk Electric Power Corporation. So you have to do what I tell you to do. The commander of the rescue team takes control in a disaster area. And that's me. Who on earth let a civilian enter a rescue field? Hey, you. - We need to you leave. - You should leave. - Get out of here. - You get out of here. - Come here. - Let me go. - Just go. - Hey! - Get out. - Hey, you! When did you join the ROTC? I want to talk to the battalion commander. Let me go. You jerk! Is it possible to pick it up from the bottom? I mean, using an airbag. No. The maximum weight an airbag can withstand is only 10t. I know that. But we can use four airbags to lift the concrete at once. It might be possible. But we have only one air pump. It is impossible to supply air to four airbags at once. That's the problem. What if we fill the remaining airbags with water? We can still use the fire hydrant. We can cover the airbags with tarpaulin... and fill three airbags with water at once. It is connected. It might work. But I don't think the airbags will last for a long time. Once we secure enough room to get in, we can install the supports to withstand the weight. I will give it a try. We have a plan. We should hurry. - Yes, Sir. - Yes, Sir. It seems to be enterobrosia. It may lead to to peritonitis. Move him to Medicube. We don't have a car available now. Car number 3 broke down, so only car number 2 is available. I can't believe this. Can we use a phone yet? No. Doctor! Here you are. Here. Where did you get these? That foreign doctor. He brought some patients to Medicube. He said a village near downtown is swept aside. And they gave these to us. You should use channel number three. Doctor Kang, do you hear me? Daniel? Thanks for the radio. You saved my life. Nurse! Then please permit the usage of the operation room. We have a patient with massive bleeding and skull fracture. They said I can't use the operation room without your permission. I'm almost about to do surgery at the entrance. It sounds fit for a medical litigation. Can he hear me? You're listening, right? Why? Do you want him to make an appointment or what? Do you think we are in Seoul? I'm opening the operation room now. It's open. Thank you. Please save his life. Save him so that he can file a suit against you. Roger. I sent Ye Hwa to you in case you need a hand. I need a lot of hands. Thank you. We don't know when the airbags will burst. And you're saying you'll... crawl under the layers of concrete only using the airbags. Who would do that unless they want to die? We will do it. We installed the airbags. Situation room. We secured the access to the buried survivors. We will initiate a rescue. Send the medical team to the scene. We are alive! - You are safe! - I'm here. Good to see you. What a relief! This way. What is your name? Park Yong Man. I'm Park Yong Man. I'm okay. But there are more survivors. I'm not sure where they are. But I heard Mr Ko was there. They are searching for more survivors now. Don't worry about it. The blood pressure is 60 to 30. Drowsy mentality. Get him an IV. Yes, Doctor. We are out of IVs. - Here you are. - Thank you. Hemoperitoneum? He has abdominal inflation and a weak pulse. No pupillary reaction. Give him 10ml of epinephrin. His heart is beating again. He seems to be in shock from hemoperitoneum. We need to perform a laparotomy. Please send him to Medicube. The operation room is full there. How long does it take to get to the Corps Command? It takes at least 30 minutes by helicopter. He won't last that long. Then we should do it here. Do what? His pulse is not regular. The operation. We can't do it here. It is bright over there. - It's too dark here. - Are you out of your mind? How can you do an operation without a CT scan? You don't even know where he is bleeding. That's why we need to do a laparotomy. Is there anything else we can do? You want to cut his abdomen open in the cement dust? Do you know what kind of side effects it can cause? Septicaemia, fat embolism, cardiac insufficiency, stenosis... I asked you if there was anything else we could do. Hurry up and decide. He is your patient. I can't believe this. Bring me the mes set for operation. Bring me as much Betadine and disinfectants as you can. Yes. We should move him out from the shade. Ye Hwa! Give me a hand. Doctor. Here you go. It's set on channel number three. Thank you. Doctor. Here. - Oh, no. - I'm very sorry. I'm really sorry. Leave it. Just don't do anything. You are injured. I'm sorry. Please get me the mes set for operation and Betadine. Was there another earthquake here? That's not it. I made a mistake. What are you looking for? Vitamin? - How much of Betadine? - As much as I can get. Can I take the disinfectants, too? Excuse me. Sit down here for a while. I will take care of her. Okay. It's anaesthesia. Gosh, she's stubborn. Is it because you don't like taking shots? You are in severe pain right now. She doesn't even speak English. Look. It's anaesthesia. Let me do it. Gosh. I can't believe this. What is she saying? What am I supposed to do? My baby. You're pregnant? Baby? This is insane. It will hurt really bad. Do you think you can manage? Okay? Okay. Are you ready? One. Two. Three. Doctor Kim! Doctor Kim! Hi, I'm Martin from The World Times. Is this the casualty count? My name is Gi Beom. Yes. You're with the Korean Army, right? Can you fill me in on the situation? What should I say? I am soldier. Okay? Doctor Ha. Doctor Ha. She is doctor... No. She's Nightingale. Come on, come on. He's American. Are you a nurse? May I ask you a couple of things? I am busy. Doctor Song. He is doctor. Come on, come on. He's American. What's the latest situation? The casualty count is... I'm not good at English. So, I beg your pardon. This is Medicube. Can any of the doctors help? We need more hands in the operation room. This is Song. I'll be there. - Okay. Please hurry. - Got it. Over. Hey, hey. Hey. I'll do the interview if you take me to the hospital. Come on. Hurry. Okay. That was cool. He's a useless guy, but he's a great doctor. Urgent notice. We need type AB blood urgently. Can anyone help? This is Lance Corporal Kim Gi Beom. I'm type AB. Wipe this. I can't see clearly. Secure this side of the retractor. He's type AB. This will sting a bit. Doctor Kang. Are you hurt? Not me. We need a doctor to go inside. Hurry. It's urgent. Manager. Hello, Doctor. What are you doing in this dangerous place? I'll give you a painkiller. Can you feel your legs and toes? A man my age... doesn't have much use for the lower body. Do you see my foot move? It hurt so much until a while go. Seeing your face took all that pain away. I'm pleased to hear that. How long will it take to lift this? You have... one more patient to see. It hurts. It hurts a lot. Quickly, quickly. Don't move. You are lucky it missed your heart, but if you move, it might hit your spine. Am I going to die? If you try to stay still, you won't die. He needs to go to the operation room with the steel beam inside him. Cut it about here. Let's have a chat first. Talk. In private. Is there a problem? The problem is that the two sites are connected. If we lift the concrete slab that fell on Mr Ko, the beam will rise. It will go right through the other patient. What if you cut the beam first? That will change the structure's centre of gravity. The slab on Mr Ko will bear the extra weight. Are you saying that... saving one will kill the other? There is no other way. I have no other option, either. In this situation, we follow the Rules of Rescue. The doctor decides... who is more likely to survive, and we save that person. Are you telling me to decide? Who to kill and who to save? Yes. That is... what you have to do. We're prepared to save either one of them. It will take 10 minutes. Have you decided? Give me 10 minutes. We don't have time. We'll wait. She made that request as a doctor. Let's prepare for action. Yes, Sir. Captain Yoo. Are you still standing around? Why are you taking your time? You said that one of them won't make it anyway. Just save whoever that'll be easier to rescue, and let's tunnel into the office. We're following the Rules of Rescue. We aren't done talking yet. Do you know what papers they are? It's our signed contract... with the Urk government that covers our whole operation. The local government pays my wages, but I'm a Korean citizen and I'm doing this out of patriotism. I start any karaoke session with Korea's national anthem. Do you get it now? This is of national importance. You're a soldier. Shouldn't you put your country first? Why do you care whether a few... manual labourers live or die? Hey. "Hey"? Did you just say... Yes. I'm talking to you. Our country. What is it, exactly? Our country puts its people's lives and safety first. That means that... when a jerk like you is in trouble, we will do whatever it takes to get you to safety. As a soldier, nothing is more important than saving the life of a Korean citizen. If you need your papers... get them yourself. This is unbelievable. You made a big mistake. Great. Get lost. Watch out! Is everyone okay? Mr Ko's fine. Look over there. Are you all right? Oh, I'm... Yes. I am. Sergeant Gong. We have a live wire. Check the lines. Yes, Sir. When we lift the slab... to get you out from underneath, it will hurt a lot for a while. No painkillers will help. He has three kids. A boy and two girls. What? Him over there. I don't know much, but you can't save us both, can you? Don't worry. I've been working on construction sites... for 30 years. I'm quick to notice things. I got the picture. Whatever the case, we will do our best. I know. Please do. It's lovely, being able to lie down here and look up at... the blue sky. I am a blessed man. I worked long enough and earned enough to send... all my kids to college. Can you give me more painkillers? It hurts like crazy. No more painkillers. You have to go under anaesthesia for your surgery later on. Clench your fist. Am I going to live? Please, save me, please. I didn't move one bit. I promise. Good. We need to open it up. From here, 3cm up. - Right angle. - Okay. Get this guy to buy you a meal if he lives. Will he live? You're saving him. Am I? Lance Corporal Kim Gi Beom... is actually saving a person? Can I tell Sergeant Major Seo? Wait in line. I'm first. Ye Hwa, we didn't come to Urk for this. They didn't come to Urk to get hurt, either. You'll keep your promise? Of course. It's a blood promise. There's the head of Haesung Hospital, the head of Mowuru Plant... and the head of Taebaek Unit. Who do you want to interview? - Daniel Spencer. - Daniel Spencer. He wasn't in your options. It'd be nice to have someone who's a veteran with disaster scenes. I know. You guys think that he's so famous... and smart, but... It's all about the look. That's exactly why we want Daniel. Not only can he talk, but he's also got the look. My goodness. What losers. It doesn't look too good. The welders' oxygen tanks could... set off an explosion. The ground isn't firm. - Watch out. - Yes, Sir. Sergeant Major Seo! What happened? The floor gave way. Sergeant Major Seo fell. Do you think he's in danger? Can you take this out? - Sit down. - But... Sit down or this man dies. Give me a clamp. Okay. Wolf to Command. I fell on top of sand, so I'm not injured. I'm fine. I guess Sergeant Major Seo's fine after all. Be quiet. You're distracting me. We are ready. Have you... decided? In Mr Ko's case, necrosis has begun in his lower limbs. Once you remove the concrete slab, it could cause crush syndrome. The local labourer... is pierced by a steel beam that is preventing bleeding, but even in the operation room, I might not be able to prevent massive blood loss. If you were me... who would you save? Why are you asking me? You examined them, and diagnosed them. Now make the call. But... you have more experience than I do. You might be able to make the best decision than... The best? Do you think this is what we can call best? There is no best decision at rescue fields. We just solve problems... that are in front of us. I know that, but... I've been treating people all day without structure or protocol. - I don't know if I'm doing... - You're doing fine. Despite the poor conditions, you either do your best... or do nothing and let them die. It's either one or the other. There's no time to whine. We don't expect you to... create a perfect miracle. You're one of the many doctors who can't find a cure... to a common cold. All I expect from you is... that level of a diagnosis. So tell me your decision. As a doctor. My decision is... Synced & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by VIU. The beam pierced his chest, but I'm not sure if it touched his spine. He's still responsive, so administer a broad-spectrum antibiotic and take X-rays... I know. You said it already through the radio. Leave it to us and get some rest. No, I'll scrub in. Is the portable X-ray ready? We're out of film. And the steriliser is broken, too. It's a mess. We have to do something. You scrub in, too. I can't do it alone. Let's go. He's under. This patient... will not die here today. We'll get this out. Quickly and accurately. Ready? One. Two. Three. His vitals are stable. You all did a great job. You too. You did well. Salute. Salute. You all did a great job today. Back up has arrived, so you can all go and rest. - Good job. - Thank you. They are still continuing with rescue operations. Thankfully, there hasn't been much harm done to our soldiers. We have been reported that everyone is safe and alive. Then Lieutenant Yoon is also... Yes, she is unscathed. I didn't stop Captain Yoo from leaving. I thought you would be worried so that's why i invited you here today. I am not worried about a soldier doing his work. Excuse me for saying this, but... I am relieved that my daughter is with Captain Yoo. I think highly of Captain Yoo. Si Jin will easily become a general. I have high expectations for him. I'm not sure he is a man of such calibre. He is an excellent soldier. He has a lot of loyal people around him. Si Jin must be blessed to have such kind people. We have just been informed from the Taebaek Corps that the... medical staff are safe and are carrying out rescue activities. So please don't worry. Honey, are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. It's a relief. When will their flight be ready? We will send one as soon as the local airport is normalised. When will that be? No. Let us talk to Chi Hun first. I need to hear his voice before I can relax. Their personal phones have not been recovered yet. The military satellite telephone at Corps Command is working. - But we cannot allow personal... - Hey, you! I invested in launching the satellite. Put me through him right now. Right now. Your mother in law yelled at the chairman like he was a child. I heard that the hospital land belongs to Chi Hun's family. Madam. We're on good terms, aren't we? One person died. Oh, my. Is it all finished? Yes, just a while ago. Is the patient alive? For now. But are you... I don't have a lighter. I was going to ask if you are all right. My goodness. What kind of question is that? Give me a cigarette, too. What kind of doctors smokes? Quit smoking this instant. Doctor. Nurse. Excuse me. - My goodness! - Nurse! Nurse! I told you to bring the doctor. Can't you hear me? - You can't do this. - You little... What's the matter? Ma'am, it's just that... Now I have someone who can understand me. You know me, right? I'm the chief manager at the power plant, - Jin Young Su. - So? I have been standing all day today, so I have low blood sugar. My goodness. I am feeling so dizzy. Oh, my. I'm dying here. Oh, my goodness. Hey. If you have any dextrose or any other injection of that sort, inject one over here. Be sure to include garlic. I told him he can't. It's all right. Get back to what you were doing. Yes, Ma'am. This is Miss B. There's a patient here dying from wanting a nutrient injection. If there's a doctor that is dying of boredom, could you please come? Over. Is that so? How's the patient? He looks like he needs to immediately see an eye doctor. If he isn't blind he can see the... conditions of the patients on the patient bed. But he says he's dying of fatigue. His mouth seems well alive though. He must have gone completely insane. That's what I said. What's your name? Ha Ja Ae. What did you say your name was again? What? Did you just talk down on me? Since you talked down on me first, I thought you wanted to be friends. We've already exchanged names. How old are you? Why these little... You, just wait and see. Yes. I will do just that. Min Ji, come here. The steriliser is broken, so we have a lot to do. - Let's go. - Yes, Ma'am. My goodness. Hey, you! What are we going to do? With the remaining ration, it won't be possible to... feed everyone including the injured. After we return from a scene of life and death, another problem awaits. Let's make to with combat ration as much as we can. Synced & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by VIU. I figured you'll be starving. Will this do? I brought enough for 100 people for now. Perfect. You are the best. We'll buy drinks for 100 people. It's on Sergeant Major Seo. I had my pay reduced. First squad, come out and receive your ration. Sit down and listen while eating. At ease. You've all done well working without sleep. Since we have contacted your parents from Corps Command, don't worry. As soon as the communications network is repaired, we will let you use video call, so please wait a little. - Yes, Sir. - Yes, Sir. We will be assigned to the rescue operations tomorrow as well. It will be a rough day, so as soon as you finish dinner, go to sleep as soon as possible. Don't think too deeply about... what happened today... and the current situation we're in. Just empty your mind. Just obey your orders. I will give only the right orders. Understood? - Yes, Sir. - Yes, Sir. End of roll call. Are you here... on your own account or on my father's orders? A commander has to send the best troops... to the most intense battlefields. I'm not sure why you are taking his side. For your information, I am not doing well. Please call your father. He is probably very worried. How did you feel? How would you have felt if I was not all right? I would have regretted... all those times I tried to run away from you. And you're just standing there like that? Move over. This is my job. I will do your job, so move over. It is really inconvenient to not have a steriliser. Aren't you scared? What did I tell you? You should've ran away with me when we had just arrived. If I was married, I could have used my wife and children as an excuse. Yes, you should have. What have you been doing with your life? You're not the one to talk. Repeat after me. It's 1, 0, 3, 0. Okay, 1, 0, 3, 0. What is this? It's the password to my laptop. If I die here, turn on my laptop and go to C drive. There should be a folder named "Unknown"... right below my hospital files. Please erase that folder. I ask this of you as a friend. What's in that folder? That's disgusting. Erase it right now. You will see much more than whatever you're expecting. My gosh. So, please make sure to erase that folder yourself. You are a pervert! Did you say it was 1, 0, 3, 0? Is that the age range of women you'd like to date? Erase it now! Over my dead body. My goodness. This is all ready. Let's turn this off and go back in. We're done. Erase it. Come on. You are so disgusting! My goodness. - Is he conscious? - Not yet. We'll have to keep an eye on him until tomorrow. This is the patient who had to go through surgery at the site, right? He has consciousness. He is getting better. Check his vitals every three hours. She fractured her foot. She wasn't anaesthetised when her bone was put back in place... because she was pregnant, but she did very well. Your child is very energetic, too. Isn't that your mobile? I had some classical songs on them. I wanted to help calm the baby. You're a great doctor. And you're a great father, too. Does he listen to classical music? My gosh. Thank you for your shoes. Thank you very much. (RESCUE STATUS: 18 DECEASED, 41 INJURED) (RESCUE STATUS) (UNIDENTIFIABLE BODIES) - Take this. - I got it. Synced & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by VIU. No matter how well you hide, you can never hide from me. Let go of me, and let's talk this out. Hello, Doctor. You're doing a great job. Salute. Do you need anything? I'm just looking around. You can go back to your post. Wasn't your shoulder hurt? Right, could you take a look? Yes, Sir. How did you bear the pain? I think you need stitches. No wonder. It hurt a lot. - I will get the medical team. - No, it's all right. I'll go myself. Come here. What happened? I was rescuing people without taking caution. I am fine. How did you hear that? I was asking you inside my head. Yes, I heard it loud and clear. I am very thankful... that you are here. Thank you for... fighting with us. Thank you, too. I didn't mean to sound very mean before. I know. Do you? Do you know how long I've been working as a doctor? Doctors see more people die... than a soldier... with a gun. If my comfort fell short, just disregard what I said. But... I really want you to be all right... with all my heart. Then... do something you are good at, instead of saying weird things to comfort me. Something I'm good at? What could that be? You're good at making jokes. I think what I need the most is... a joke. You look very pretty right now. You can't see me. I saw you before. You're a person who's likely to stay pretty. That's a truth. It was a joke. I really missed you. No matter what I did, I couldn't stop thinking about you. I tried tiring myself out. I tried very hard to forget. I drank and did everything I could. But I still missed you a lot. Was this something you never thought you'd hear? Then you should think on it. This time, I am serious. (DESCENDANTS OF THE SUN) Do you... risk your life to do everything? I am a great worker. And a part of my work is... to not get killed. How does the inside look? I won't be surprised if it collapsed any minute soon. Over here! Go in here! I'm sorry. I am so sorry. What are you talking about? Check the plant right away! What happened to your hand? Big Boss, do you copy? I am getting ready to run whenever I need to. I can't fall down here. Is there anyone here? There is a dead man here!
