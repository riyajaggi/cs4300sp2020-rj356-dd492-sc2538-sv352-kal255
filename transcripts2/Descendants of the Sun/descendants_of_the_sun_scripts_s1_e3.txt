 Let me ask you a question. This may be the last time we see each other. It's about that kiss. Do not bring that up until I... What should I do about it? Should I apologise... or confess my love? You are... very charming. You are charming but dangerous. And because you're dangerous, I don't like it.

 Every time I catch your eye, I am charmed. I think I have to stand you up this time. You're leaving? Is something wrong? I need to go. Right now? I'm sorry. Due to the policy, I can't go into detail. Did he belong in your squad? He was a comrade of mine. So that means you were also... So that means... let's not talk about it.

 I hoped there was more time. So I could simplify my complicated mind, get rid of fear... and take the time to think... if I could become a girlfriend of this dangerous... yet charming man. But you... keep on leaving like this. I can't get angry at you for leaving... nor can I ask you not to leave. I feel like a fool for having been complicated all by myself. At the moment... I just simply don't like you. Apologise. I'll take your apology. I'm sorry. I hope all is well with you. Salute. One. Two. Three. Four. 1, 2, 3 and 4. Charming Men There are lots of them But I here Am the man The charming man Hello. Where is Captain Yoo? He wasn't in his office. He left last night. He had to take the civil aircraft. He probably departed by now. Salute. He doesn't give a second chance. (Descendants of the Sun Episode 6) This photo is still here. Father. You should have listened to your mum and become a judge or doctor. No one appreciates a soldier these days. If I were only smart. But I was also very athletic. It would have been a great loss to have become a judge or doctor. You just... live healthy and long. I'll become a general and make you take a picture with me. Oh, my. Who'll make a person without strings, a general? You even threw away the chance to become a major. Does it look all right? I did it as you taught me. Please be proud. In the path of a soldier, there are days when going to the guardhouse... is more honourable than being promoted. You did well. We are ready for you. Please come in. Head in first. I'll bring Mother. All right. Get ready. 1, 2 and 3. Trainee number 17. I will descend. Descend. Oh, my. My goodness. Help me. Please help me. Help me. Sit down. Get up. Lie down. Two. One. Stop. There seems to be nothing wrong with your body. It must be your head. No Sir! - Change of shift.  - Change of shift. Do you want to kill me? Yes, Sir! You can't kill me with that stamina. I give you 30 seconds to go and come back from the main gate. Left, face. If you meet me outside, I'm willing to go up against you any time. Let's bring up your stamina today. Run. Go. The handsome trainee. Ready for descent. Descend. Get me down. Recruit, stop acting up and descend. Watch carefully. This is the perfect posture for Adding Friction Rappel. Aren't you off duty? What are you doing here? I had to come. I missed you so much. When are you finished? Let's have some drinks after. Did the discharge ceremony for your father go well? It was so touching that I almost cried when he got a flower bouquet. It's good to see you again being healthy. Salute. Salute. Hey, it has been a year since we got together last time, hasn't it? It's been a long time. Let's drink up a box of soju. We will do bottoms up. Bottoms up? Okay. Let's drink it all with a big glass. Do you know them? I was their evil instructor. Gosh. It's okay. I don't look like a soldier at all. Don't keep the collar up of your jacket. They'd notice that you are a soldier. What? Sergeant Major Seo? You are Sergeant Major Seo Dae Yeong, aren't you? It seems they found you. Where is the retreat route? It is at your five o'clock. You are him. You are Sergeant Major Seo Dae Young. Do you remember us? You gave your word when you were the instructor. You promised to pick a fight with us regardless of rank. I said when we meet outside. We are not outside now. We are inside. Why would you pick a fight with me now? They are funny. You should keep the precious memories buried in your heart. I can't believe this. Precious memories? Stand up at three. - One.  - Three. Is it Armed Forces Day or what? Catch him! Oh no. At your two o'clock. Three. I don't think this is right. Catch him! There they are! Catch them! Run! Run faster! Stop there! Catch them! That way! There they are. Where are they? Where did they go? That way. Where are they? Find them. You count numbers in a weird way. Is it 3 after 1? I am not good at mathematics. You should've counted if you were that good at it. I'm tired. Oh no. It seems the rigid instructor is getting old, too. Maybe this is the perfect time to pick a fight with you. When I was a Military Academy cadet, you were very harsh on me as a drill instructor. Do you remember? I remember that. Do you want to fight now? I don't remember. All I have is happy memories. I just got sober all of a sudden. Did you drink the wine I left for you? I just tasted it. Did you drink it alone? I drank it with Dr Kang. Did it go well? It didn't go well. It feels like I get dumped by a girl whenever I am on vacation. I still miss her, but I think I will be fine pretty soon. Little strokes fell great oaks. You can't say that. You don't make even one little stroke. It is not convincing. It's not that I didn't make a stroke. The problem is that I made a stroke on myself. I think we are stupid. It creates a synergy effect when we are together. I should go. Where are you going? I'm going home. My house is around here. Did you run away to here on purpose? Is this how you save on fares? Enjoy your vacation. Salute. You don't even ask me to stop by your house. Your house is in the neighbourhood. Gosh. (Yoon Myeong Ju) He... Hello? Hello? Seo Dae Yeong, did you just answer my call? You answered the phone! Why did you answer my call? Is everything okay? Tell me anything. I know you are there. It's okay. Just listen to me then. Just don't hang up the phone. Okay? I'm doing fine here. I'm wearing my combat uniform. So I didn't get a mosquito bite. And I'm in good health here. I miss Seo Dae Yeong a lot. Did you meet Si Jin? He made fun of me a lot when he was here. He kidded about me coming here just to see you. He said I'm pretty but I look prettier when I put away my pride. I don't care about my pride. I know how much Seo Dae Yeong loves me. Are you listening to me? Let me hear at least your breathing if you are listening to me. You are coming back to Korea soon, aren't you? I've got good wine for you. I don't drink with a woman. Prepare a man for me instead. A good man. What about the man you met on the other side of the world? He is not your type as you see him again? That's not it. He was the best. I shouldn't have received an apology. I should have held him. And I should have confessed my love. I'm the one who missed all the opportunities. How could he have liked me? (Anti-aging Clinic, Body-Check!) Oh, shoot. Don't. There you go. You can translate, right? If you lick things like this, your tummy will hurt a lot. Promise that you won't lick things like this any more. Okay? (If you lick things like this, I will shoot you.) Before you eat, you must wash your hands. (If you don't wash hands before you eat,) (I will shoot you.) Why did they laugh? Did you say something silly? Kids at that age laugh a lot. Salute. Where's your current location? - The army base.  - I'm fishing in Yangpyeong. The fresh air and water is great. It's is like therapy. Then why did you call? I'm bored. Could you join me? It's so scary here at night. I'm hanging up. I'm in trouble. I don't operate any more. Experiences in surgery don't do any good on my resume. I'll go back soon, and when I do, I have to fight to reclaim my title. I'll be very busy. I see. Here. I think you have a better chance. See if... you can really come back. It can't be. Yes, it's the same car. You're too good to be a doctor. Maybe that's why I make more money at the store. You're leaving today, I heard. Yes. Thank you for everything. This might only cover the parts, but I want to pay you. If that's the case, could you donate 10 dollars a month long-term? Very well. I'll pay you back in instalments. Thank you. Call me if you get bored and really want to work. I think I had enough of volunteering... for the rest of my life. I must go back to where I belong. Will you be staying here? I think so because this year is my sabbatical. You never know. Today's plans might change tomorrow. Take care. Look after yourself. Give Ye Hwa my regards. What are you doing? Everyone's waiting. - I'll be done in five.  - You should've started earlier. Hepatamine, Freamine. We'll never meet again, so can I ask you something? No. The IV drips are... Do you like Si Jin? That face says everything. Thanks. For what? I didn't answer. You did, with your whole body. Just a moment. What timing. It's him. I'm glad you called. Doctor Kang, Ms Kang or Mo Yeon. I don't exactly know what to call her yet, but does she like you? Myeong Ju. Hey. Shouldn't you answer the phone with a salute? What are you calling as? A friend or senior officer? A neighbourhood friend. I'm having coffee with Dae Yeong. I'm having a latte, he's having an espresso. I doubt he even knows what he's drinking. He knows. I taught him. What were you talking about? I just wanted to fluster you a bit. I'm in the middle of a battle of nerves with Mo Yeon. What? You shouldn't bully civilians. So you just changed the topic. Do you want to know how she reacted? Are you crazy? Hang up. What did she do? - Is she angry?  - She is. But she still looks pretty. Keep up the good work. Bye. Salute. I expected him to ask me to put you on. He was flustered. Of course he was. I'm not exactly that forgettable. Is this why he likes you? Medical Team. Medical Team. Come outside for a group photo. Go and join them. That's what you're here for. - Doctor Kang.  - Coming. That's why I'm here, but it's not the only reason. I couldn't finish because you interrupted me. Check the inventory, and hand it over to the UN. And look after yourself... until you get back. - It's over.  - Finally. - Let's go home!  - We're going home! Are you ready? Okay, then. 1, 2, 3. All done. Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you!  - Thank you! You guys were great! To thank you for your work, our commander told us to take you by helicopter. Do we not have to take the four-hour bus ride? We'll get you to the airport in just 30 minutes. Because there's a weight limit, you'll leave in two teams. - Good luck.  - Win for us. Don't lose. Rock, paper, scissors. - What?  - We won. - Play again!  - That's not fair! Play or lose, rock, paper, scissors. What a view. It's beautiful. We only got to see it now. What a pity. Look at the colour of the water. This is the kind of thing we should look at. All we get to see is... large intestines, small intestines, duodenums... That's not what we're meant to see. Captain Yoo always says that... this sight makes him... want to defend this place. Move faster. I'm so handsome. When I get back to Korea... Sir. You troublemaker. Wear a safety helmet. You're on site. You must wear a safety helmet whenever you're on site. You just ruined my hairdo. If something falls on your head, it'll kill you right away. What's going on? What I need next are plates. The plates should be somewhere here. It's an earthquake! Get out! What's happening to us? Get out of here. Let's go! Sir! How could something like this happen? (Urk earthquake, 6.7 magnitude) This is a secure channel. This is Captain Yoo Si Jin of Team Alpha. Put on anyone who knows about the situation at Mowuru Company. Do not hang up and do it now. Yesterday afternoon local time... They're supposed to return today, but we can't reach anyone. Yes, Sir. The earthquake hit Mowuru, which is about 200km... from Minami, the capital of Urk. Local news reports say shakes were felt in Minami as well. Oh no. Do you think everyone's okay? What about Chi Hun? They will all be fine. Nothing will happen. I don't know anything. I just saw the news myself. I'm off to an emergency meeting. I'll tell you if I hear anything. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is focusing on contacting survivors. We reached the Corps Command, but not Lieutenant Yoon who's in Mowuru. - So...  - Where's the air carrier? It's being loaded. It can leave in 10 mins. We'll focus our efforts on locating Lieutenant Yoon... Don't waste time on one lieutenant. She's there on duty. Seo Dae Yeong's not on the list. Summon him. He volunteered already. He's on standby. Is my car ready? Yes, Sir. I already said you can't. We were told to put you on the plane. Get on board... while there's still a way out. Why do you make me repeat myself? Must we waste precious time? We'll take full responsibility. Take us back. I can't. Get on the plane. I was given orders... I'm in charge of my team. Any natural disaster... creates the need for a medical team. Half of my team is back there too. We won't leave without them. You always do things you can't... I really don't like you. - Do you know that?  - I do now. Let's discuss that later. Can our government send a rescue team? Urk is considered... a trouble nation, so we can't legally send any civil servants. Saying what you can't do doesn't help solve the problem. We sent a medical team over there, and we haven't heard from them yet. I'm Yoon Gil Joon, Commander of the Special Forces. We promise... to send our best men and resources... to try and get your people out. How exactly will you do that? If something happens to my staff... If it's money you need, Haesung Group will foot the bill. Let's do something. A C-17, our fastest transport aircraft, leaves in 30 minutes, at exactly 01:00, from the base in Suwon. On board... Even among the Special Forces, the most experienced are on aboard. Did you give up your vacation? I did what I had to do. But you can still admire me. Ha Ja Ae. Ja Ae. Ja Ae. Where's Ha Ja Ae? Where is she? Ha Ja Ae! Be quiet. I'm over here. But why are you here? Didn't you leave? You're all right? It's a relief that you're fine. Are you all right? Did anyone get hurt? There was quite a shake, but everyone is fine. The phones got disconnected and we couldn't get to anyone. I was scared to death. It's all right. Don't cry. Thank goodness, everyone is fine. Don't go anywhere and wait here. I'll try to contact Seoul. Let's go. How is he? He dislocated his shoulder. But the army surgeon put it back. It's nothing. I'm fine. The people near the barracks weren't severely injured. But why did you come back? Is it worse at the airport? Really? Have flights been cancelled? No it's not that. There wasn't much damage at the airport. We couldn't just leave without knowing you were all right. So we turned the helicopter around. What a relief. I thought I would never go back home again. Medicube. Medicube. Is the army surgeon there? This is Lieutenant Yoon. What is the matter? This is the power plant. The building is collapsed. Pardon? We can't hear you well. The power plant is collapsed. Oh no. (Ambulance) So that the patients can recognise you easily, please wear your vests. You all know the triage protocol, right? Green for non-emergency, yellow for slight injury... and red for the emergency patients who need prompt treatment. And to the critical patients that cannot be treated at the scene, black. The same colour as the deceased. Give up on the patients marked black. And focus on those who can be saved. Do we need to take your order on giving morphine or demerol? No. We can't do that for everyone. Use your judgment regarding the situation... and choose the best possible alternative you can. Let's go now. Hey. - Are you all right?  - I'm fine. This is the patient. Excuse me. Can you hear me? He has no external bleeding. He has pulse, but is unconscious. He's in momentary shock. Please supply him with oxygen while I get ready. Okay. - Fasten this.  - Okay. You're done. Please be patient. Excuse me. Wait, excuse me. I'm the chief manager of this site. Have you begun the search inside the building? The building is still collapsing, so we've suspended entry to it. But first, do you know the head count at the site? We can't locate Manager Ko. Manager Ko is in the afternoon shift today. - So about 30 people? I don't know.  - Pardon? He must be still inside. Let's do this. I left a very important thing... back in my office. - Support needed. Support needed.  - I'm on my way. - Where are you going?  - Please stay off this site. Didn't you hear what I said? Wait! Doctor Ha. He isn't breathing. Chi Hun! Oh, my. Oh, my goodness. There's a person here. Is anyone there? There's a person here, I say. I'm going to die. Manager? It hurts. It hurts. Quickly. Quickly. Quickly. Who is it? It hurts. It hurts so much. It hurts. It hurts. The pain is killing me. What? Are you hurt? Are you badly hurt? Goodness me. Wait just a minute. Oh, my. My goodness. There's a person here. Is anyone there? Help us! I'll take this patient. Please go over there. Doctor Lee is there. No. Leave him to me and go over there. How is the patient? He still has pulse. He can still live if we keep on doing this. Though you can feel his pulse, his heart stopped from over bleeding. I am sorry, but this patient is dead. No. I can do it. I can save him. Stop. The time of death in Urk local time... Don't! Wait. He was fine. He was all right. Since he didn't have any ache, I gave him a yellow band. I put it on him. Snap out of it. Would you? Not now. Stop acting like a child. If you're a doctor, act like one. What kind of doctor am I? I can't even put the band on properly. What kind of a doctor is that? You're a doctor. A person that is needed on this site. You are that doctor. So announce your patient's time of death... and go to where you're needed. Go to the patients that you can save. Can't you hear them crying for help? Come on, Chi Hun. The time of death... is 3:40pm... Urk time. Come. Hey, Mo Yeon. Is everything all right? Please give me a call, okay? I bought some wine, so come back and drink it. I have been granted the permission to become a doctor. I faithfully bow... to give my life to serve humanity. Medical team! Sir, it's an emergency. The health and life of my patient will be... my priority. (Outdoor meal) I will faithfully carry out my duties... toward my patients... regardless of their race, religion, or nationality. Let's go! In 1 and 2! Let's go! In 1 and 2! Let's go! I will not use my knowledge inhumanely... even when I am under threat. Your injury is minor. What is it? Are you hurt? I hereby take this oath... on my account... and on behalf of my honour. Is that a patient? Should I go get the medial team? (Death count) Please help me. My friend is sick. Hurry. Everyone, attention! To Captain! - Salute!  - Salute! Salute. Great job, everyone. Is anyone hurt? - No, Sir!  - No, Sir! Good. I heard everything on my way here, so no report needed. We will begin... our rescue plan on the power plant. Is there anyone who needs to be excused? - No, Sir!  - No, Sir! Good. There is only one thing you should look out for. Do not get hurt. If we get hurt, we cannot save the people who need to be rescued. Do you understand? - Yes, Sir!  - Yes, Sir! That's all. Return to your post. - To our post!  - To our post! It's good to see that you are okay. I was very worried about you. All right, then. Sergeant Major Seo Dae Yeong. Do not get hurt. This is an order. Keep that order with your life. Do you get it? Thankfully, you aren't hurt. I've been regretting... not saying goodbye to you before I left on that day. I can't be with you. So, please... be careful. You, too. (Descendants of the Sun) You should call him first. He must be worried. What about you? How would you have felt if I was not okay? That means you're going to walk into... the ruins of broken concrete. Are you crazy? Tell them that I am going in. I'm going with you. I'm here! Get out of there! What is going on? Check the power plant now! Come in, Headquarters. Si Jin! Drag him here. Now! What if the ground collapses? There is no use for me to say... that it is dangerous, is there? It will collapse, but there is someone in there! We've lost the signal. Is there anyone? There is a dead man in here!
