 Is something wrong, Sir? It's something bad. Let me use your last card. I need a chopper. I... have a date again. (Episode 12) I feel better now. The cure is working. That's good to hear. But why are you wearing that?

 Are you going somewhere? We lost contact with both Doctor Kang and Big Boss. We believe that Doctor Kang, whom we can't reach, has been kidnapped. And Big Boss, who won't answer our call, must've begun a solo operation. - Then... - You said my present is on the way. Can I open the present now? Keep it safely with you. You know that I need to buy that if you lose it, right? You know that you need to come back, right? We will begin carrying out Unauthorised Black Operation. Violence with the armed gang is to be expected. Except us, there are no backups.

 It will be an operation outside the uniform. And there's a chance that you may not return. Anyone who wants out, can do so now. Does anyone want out? - No, Sir. - No, Sir. Good. Vacation is over. As of this moment, everyone... will return to Team Alpha. The deal with North Urk is done. They transferred all the money. Bye-bye. In the morning In the... Lighten up. In the morning What should we do with the kids? We should dump everything that doesn't fit in the suitcase. (Take care of the children.) Yes, Sir. - Go. - Move. - Move. - Move. - Go. - Go. Drop your gun. What are you doing here? What are you doing here alone raising your hands? I was intimidated thinking I was alone. Now I'm welcoming my friends with open arms. Don't be intimidated. All Team Alpha members have returned from furlough. I will express... my gratitude later. Captain Big Boss. Here is the operation order for Team Alpha. Piccolo and Harry Potter, Protect the children. Leave this place as soon as possible. - Yes, Sir. - Yes, Sir. Wolf and Snoopy, you will conduct hostage rescue operations... - with me. - Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir. What? Who is conducting what operation? As of 22:00 this evening, the Republic of Korea Special Forces... began conducting Unauthorised Black Operation... Look here, Commander Yoon. I never passed you the order. This is unbelievable. The US military promised to rescue the hostage within 24 hours. Korean soldiers have been dispatched to save a Korean's life. There's nothing unbelievable about this, Sir. This is not just a simple issue of a kidnapped civilian. What will we do if our troop deployment botches a CIA operation? Who will take responsibility for that? I understand your foreign affairs predicament, Sir. Stop interrupting me. This is a matter of national security which requires... diplomatic and political considerations. So let's leave the hostage rescue operation to the US military. We must pay attention to security maintenance and press control. Hey. You, politician. What did you just say? I just misheard you, right? Listen carefully if you didn't hear me correctly. I don't care... if national security means secret room politics... and camera diplomacy to you. But for my subordinates, it means sacrificing their youth to protect our homeland, and they devote their lives to perform their duties. The reason they answer the call of duty... for a country who doesn't appreciate their sacrifice... whether they're killed of captured, is because they believe... that the lives of citizens is national security itself. I will bear all responsibility for everything. You can just choose your tie... and be a politician for the journalists. I can't believe this. You said you'd bear all responsibility. Does that mean that you can resign if things go wrong? I'm willing to do so... for an honourable cause. Ye Hwa decocted this for you. She says it will help you recover. Drink it up. I'm troubling too many people. I know it's inappropriate to ask this to someone who almost died, but did something happen to Doctor Kang? Did you hear anything from Sergeant Major Seo? Has she really been kidnapped? Did Captain Yoo and his team go to rescue her? Don't worry about them. They will rescue her... by all means. What kind of means? You don't want to know about it. Gosh. Time's up. Let's see if your boyfriend... kept his promise. Let's get you dressed up. And let's go. I think they're still in the compound. We should hurry, Sir. Launch the operation. I've secured your retreat route like you asked. I only asked for retreat route. Kindly a guide came with it. I kept my word. So should you. Let the hostage go. Did you hit her? All marksmen. Ready to engage. Wolf, reporting in. Enemy position is in sight. Hold your fire. All marksmen, hold your fire. Snoopy. Can you figure out the type of bomb installed on the hostage's body? It seems to be a typical PVC type bomb vest. It will explode once he lets go of the detonator. What if we shoot his hand off? That's a negative. If you shoot his hand, the bomb vest will explode. Do we have any options? Heading to your position, Sir. Quit playing around and let the helicopter land. Let her go first... or else... it will not land. I have to be in a safe area first, or else... she dies. There is probably a wireless transmitter somewhere. Try to stall him. What are they saying, Doctor? About the weather. Such a beautiful day, they said. Do you want to die? Are you crazy? I guess you can say that. So... don't scare her, don't touch her... and don't talk to her. It's only me... you should deal with. Take me instead. No, thank you. It's much more fun travelling with a beautiful lady. On her left shoulder. The blinking green light. That's it. I'm sorry I'm late. Don't move. Just stand still. Do you trust me? Don't you dare move. What are you doing? Aiming to fire. How long will it take? One minute. I'll have it disarmed by then. Try not to move. I'm not moving. I'm trying not to, but... Look at me. Look into my eyes. Do you remember when I joked about the landmine? You told me to bring an expert. I've been wearing a uniform for 15 years, and I haven't seen a bomb he couldn't disarm. He's the best we have. So don't worry. I will not let you die. But still... There's 30 seconds left. Get as far away as you can. What do you think we'll do in 30 seconds? I'm done. Take off the vest. See? I got the vest off her, but I couldn't stop the timer. It's going to blow. Get down, Sir! Big Boss, nine o'clock. Forget this part. A call from Korea, Captain. Salute. Captain Yoo Si Jin reporting, Sir. We are now returning to base. The target was killed, and the hostage is safe. I shall disarm and await your orders. I accept any punishment, Sir. Well done. There will be no reward, but no punishment, either. That is your reward. Commander Yoon. Forget about everything and rest. That is all. My goodness, what kind of nonsense is this? Can I make a note that you ordered the mission? Please do that. I foresee a lot of problems. At least we'll know who to blame. The President will have heard, so what will happen next will be decided... The President is coming. - Now? - Yes. - Here? - Yes. I was briefed on the way. Please, sit. Is our hostage safe? Yes, but the CIA strongly protested... against this mission and its end result. So I guess we're in a diplomatic bind, then. It will affect many trade deals. Before it becomes a liability, you should end the matter by punishing the officer in charge. Is that so? I'm Yoon Gil Joon, Commander of Special Forces. I agree with him. I shall take full responsibility. I disagree. Why should you be punished for... a successful rescue operation? The hostage is safe. Now it's a political and diplomatic issue. That means it is now in my hands. I shall take care of it now. But Mr President... List up all the issues you think will arise from this situation. Thank you for rescuing one of ours. I also heard they pulled it off without any injuries. Thank you. I've never seen a gunshot wound before. We get to see all sorts of things over here. You'll need a few stitches. Yes. Bite down on this. You, get some vodka. We will remember your sacrifice. What? This is how they treat gunshot wounds. Don't you watch movies? In horror movies, the one who talks the most dies first. You bite the pen. You did well. We were worried. What should I do? Make her bite this. Hey. - One, two. - One, two. - Three, four. - Three, four. - One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four. Calling cadence, begin "Manly Men". - Manly - Manly! - Men - Men! - There are many of us around - There are many of us around Just look at them. - Sergeant Major Seo. - They're so manly. - Two. - Can we have a word? - Three. - Three. - Four. - Four. Yes? I did my best to keep it in, but my intellectual mind can't take it any more. Why do we have to see that lewd scene every day? It's a harmful influence. Sergeant Major Seo. Sergeant Major Seo! How is your wound? I was too out of it to ask you yesterday. How's Fatima? She's fine. She's being treated at Corps Command. They say she'll fully recover. Are you sure?
