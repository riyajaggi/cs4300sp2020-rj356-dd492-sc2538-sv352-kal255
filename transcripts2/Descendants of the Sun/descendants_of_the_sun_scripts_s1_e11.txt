 Yi Sun-Shin settled his navy in the west of the South Sea, at Jindo, Byuk Pa port.  At Uh-Ran port, which is only 100 miles away,  about 300 Japanese battleships began to assemble... The Admiral: Roaring Currents  Jindo, Byuk-Pa Port 12 days after the recommission So, When do you plan to have us join the army, Admiral? What do you mean? -Captain Bae-Sul- Why, His Majesty's command, of course. His Majesty has commanded us to join forces with the army, so I'm asking you when we are doing that. Is that how you read it? What? Look here Amidral,

 the enemy fleets have already exceeded 200,  Are you aware of the fact that many of our soldiers are running away already? -Captain Kim Eok-Choo- In the last ten days, about 50 soldiers have run away already... I must ask you today, Admiral... We have no idea when this enemy would show up at our doorstep, and that could be tonight So I'm curious, how do you propose to fight against such enemies? Let's heart it from our young officers! Do we stand a chance? Do we?! Don't be afraid to speak up to your commander!  Admiral... Please, enlighten us... Aside from that one mere turtle ship, do we have any other plan? Watch what you're saying to the Admiral. How dare you ! I'm your commanding officer!  Shut the hell up and listen!  The hell you are!  You should be ashamed of yourself that you ran for your life at the battle of Chil-Chun Listen boy, it's because I ran for my life, I was able to preserve those twelve ships! If you don't know shit, keep your mouth shut. Admiral... you know how futile this battle is... I saw it myself at Chil-Chun... I saw how ferocious and evil they have become!  100,000 of our men have died!  Do you intend to wipe out the entire Joseon's navy? You're dimissed, officers.  Admiral!  Your commanding officer has just ordered you!  Let us go It is important to repair the ships and check on our soldiers. Now!  Hae-Nam, Uh-Ran Port (Japanese Navy base) We must capture the king of Korea and end this war. We cannot let him escape again like six years ago. We must be quicker than storm when attacking. -Let's hurry up! -Yes, General. Can't let Genral Konishi capture their king first. I wonder why His Excellency (Toyotomi Hideyoshi) is sending me a new officer... telling me to just wait... Are those Wakizaka's men? Yes, it seems like they're returning after spying on their camp. How many times is this? Counting the last night's surprise attack, I believe... about three times. But I wonder who is this new officer that is keeping you waiting? Someone quintessential to this battle, I'm told. Apparently, there is no one better to bring down Yi Sun-Shin than him. Byuk-Pa Port, Admiral's Fleet Considering insufficient number of your navy, it would be beneficial for you to dissmis your men and join forces with army -Father! -What is he doing with his sword out?  -I overheard them saying they were going to kill us all!  -Of course they will!  Father! Father! I swear to god, I will kill you! No!!!  I apologize for using my sniper on your prisoner. It was just kind of hard to see.  Are you the new officer that the chancellor sent? They're Iyo Navy from Ehime... What navy? Everone knows they are pirates. Let's go!  Junsa Jindo Byuk Pa Port (Joseon Naval Base) -Dispatch Imminent- The Japanese are acting suspicious.  Their ships have already exceeded 200. They are filling their ships with supplies and stolen horses.  If anybody dares to fight back, they kill him and cut his nose off.  They are also using kids as practice targets. It's what they do when they occupy a region.  Is it true that 250,000 Japanese soldiers are coming down from Jeon-Joo area?  Yes, it seems true. I've overheard them saying that Joseon navy is useless and that they will soon be storming the capital city. If we let them pass,  then the capital will surely burn. Deliver this to Junsa and make sure you bring back his reply. Yes, Admiral. The top part is finished!  Sweetheart Another talisman? I've done this many times before.  You need not worry too much.  Anyway, I'll keep it safe.  Off I go Take good care of yourself, honey Joseon Army Base (General Kwon Yul's Camp) -General Kwon Yul- He's refusing to follow order again? He believes it is the right thing to do.  If he disobeys His Majesty again, there will be no forgiveness this time! Namwon fort and Jeon Joo fort have fallen arleady. Japanese army is invading from the south Moreover, their navy is trying to go around the South Sea and attack the capital.  What will happen then? With measley 12 ships, what does he think he can accomplish? Then why are you asking us to join you? How dare you! Do you not know Admiral's health is in bad shape right now? Who made him that way? Why you... do you have any idea what it is like over here? That evil Kato Kiyomasa is at our doorstep right now.  at this point, every bit helps! Stop him!  Please General, please give us weapons and men. Right now Joseon Navy needs your help!  If you follow his Maejsty's order, everything will be fine.  Do you truly intend to ignore Admiral Yi's desperate plea?  How insolent! Arrest him!  General, please! General!  Admiral told me to tell you... If you abandon the sea, you abandon Joseon!  I've been waiting for half a day.  Is this how you treat your guest? We've been too absorbed in our strategy meeting that  we forgot to greet our important guest. Please forgive us. Anyway Shall we hear from our pirate king on how to capture the king of Joseon? On our way to Joseon, I took a look at their waterway. If we go around Jindo on a morning tide,  We can supply our army by night and still take their capital. It will only take a day and a half to get to their capital. That sounds nice But Yi Sun-Shin is not a feeble opponent We should leave through the big channel in front of Jindo  Take their capital  Afterwards, I propose we join groundforces and destroy Yi Sun-Shin together.  Why do you think Hideyoshi sent me Wakizaka? What the hell did you just say? How dare you call our chancellor by name!  I'll crush Yi Sun-Shin with this hand  Or are you trying to let Konishi take their capital first?  I apologize for our behaviors. Please forgive me. Please, have a seat, Kurushima. I swear by my sword to be feared by the world  With one swing, I paint the world in blood Mother.... Father, it's me.  It's nice to be with you  Yes... Father.. Go ahead. It seems like a good opportunity, isn't it?  Why don't you retire now? We haven't been able to bring grandmother home because of this war... Hand your men over to General Kwon Yul And tell the king you are too ill to carry out your duties. You are angry at His Majesty. He tried to kill you. Aren't you upset? Father... We ony have 12 ships left... Can we even call ourselves navy at this point? Even if we could win against all odds... The King will surely abandon you. What do you fight for? I fight for loyalty. Loyal to whom?  To that... shameless king? There is a saying A warrior must follow his king And the king must follow his people not the king? There is no country without its people. Without people, there is no king. But people just want to survive. There's nothing to expect from them. Finish your meal. It is precious. Stay back! Stay back!  Admiral You all wil meet the same fate Is...is this not Captain Bae Hong Suk? Oh god, Captain Bae... What do we do? Holy shit! Get them out of here! Get out of here!  Kurushima Michiyuki 25 years old  Were you the one who sent the heads of the prisoners over to their side?! I also sent their noses and ears. Do you have a death wish? Why would you exacerbate things by upsetting your enemy? If they are worthy opponents, then why not? But Are they worth it? I told you, Yi Sun-Shin is not a feeble opponent!  I suppose what I hear is true then That many of your men secretly worship Yi Sun-Shin? So I take it your failure at the battle of Han-San has got your balls shriveled? What the fuck, you bastard!!! I'll tell you one more time Why do you think the chancellor sent me? It's because I am different than those of you who fear Yi Sun-Shin Don't be so quick to pull your sword out or your head will be the first to roll Since my brother Michiyuki had become the chancellor's dog and joined this war He paid it with his life I suppose he protected me from the chancellor's wrath by volunteering to take my place in this war But he died at the hands of Yi Sun-Shin. In any rate, the chancellor is old now. At most, he has until next year. That's why he is so eager to end this war. Joseon, which chancellor desires so much... will be mine soon. That's why Yi Sun-Shin must die. Do you understand, Haru? That is the only way  to avenge my brother. What is going on? Isn't that Oh Sang Gu? He must have been caught running away! Yeah that's him! Admiral's coming!  He was caught running away.  My comrades who fought side by side with me for years have all died... I buried their heads today... I'm so afraid... I feel like it's my turn now... Do we all have to die like them? Are you done? Military rule should be strict! Do I make myself clear? We're all screwed now... He's not going to change his mind. Fine.. I'll find a way. Myungryang Strait, Blood Island This strait is narrow and shallow. That is why the current is quite violent here. That's where it gets its name from.  (Literally translated, Ool-Dol-Mok means the corner where water leaves crying) Is this the place? But Admiral, If our enemy decides to come here, it must mean that they find this place to be useful  Look at that strong current. They will have our ships surrounded in no time. It does not seem very wise. That is why we need a turtle ship If a turtle ship can destroy the Japanese in the frontline, and the rest of our ships can fire cannons at them... It takes half a day for the current to change.  Will turtle ship be able to withstand the attacks until then? When the tide changes,  the current too, becomes mild. But the sound.... is quite unusual. Nowadays, it sounds like a grown man's cry. Problem is the whirlpool. It usually does not sound like that during high tide but when the great high tide comes and it makes sounds like that... There almost always was a big whirlpool. It's going to be the great high tide in about two days... Do you hear that? To me, it sounds like the dead sodiers' cries. Is that turtle ship your only plan? Plan isn't the issue. The problem is  the growing fear among my men. Is there truly no way to overcome this? What should we do if we can't overcome it? Is threatening them with punishment the only way To overcome fear? Would that work? Then how do you propose... I can probably use that fear... Use...use fear? Admiral...avenge us... Admiral... Please avenge us... Avenge us... You were alive... I'm glad you came Captain Choi...Captain Lee... Please avenge us, Admiral... Please avenge us... Here... Have a drink... Have a drink and stay for a while... Hey... Where are you going? Captain Lee.. Captain Choi...Hong Suk... Please wait... Where are you going in such a hurry...? Father! Turtle ship on fire! Admiral! It's Bae-Sul's men! It's on fire! Save the ship! He's over there! Don't you all want to live? Yi Sun-Shin is trying to get us all killed  But I've found a way for us! Don't throw away your lives. It's not worth it! So hurry up and-- Bring more water! Admiral please. It's dangerous, sir! No! this can't be! Let me go! No! No...no! It's our turtle ship...! Father! It's all over now. We were almost there..! I must defeat them with that ship...! No...! My lord! Yi Sun-Shin's turtle ship had just burned down. What? We sent our spies over to see what was going on when we spotted fire from his camp we were able to confirm that his turtle ship has burned down to the ground. That was his last one, wasn't it? Indeed. Yi Sun-Shin no longer has any turtle ship. The road that we must go on has no obstacles. I sure can feel your power in your caligraphy!  This should be our motto. Let's go! Junsa...Junsa where are you... Cleaning before occupying... Help me! Catch him! Catch that bastard! Hey, help me! Hey, don't go! Help me! Walk faster! One guy is missing! Find him! Walk! Faster! I'm useful. I can row really well... What the hell is he saying! What the fuck? Soo bong! You little... I'm sorry..I'm sorry! Please don't kill me! Calm down! Whirlpool... Turtle ship... Father! It's Junsa's message! Japanese plan to attack tomorrow morning. They have about 330 battle ships. Unfortunately, the new officer you asked me to look into is someone I do not know. All I know is that his name is Kurushima Michifusa and that he comes from Ehime, where it is very much like here. Good news is Wakizaka Yasuhiro is leading the second battalion I hope this helps. I will join you as soon as I return. Let's go to Hae-Nam.  Sir? We cannot fight here.  They are coming from behind us. We are going to have to leave from Hae-Nam. Let's go to war! It's from General Konishi. Why, he's hurrying me. I am sure we will capture their king first. We are ready to go. Tonight, Joseon looks especially beautiful. I like Joseon. My Lord. Report. We are ready to go.  We've chosen Joseon prisoners to serve in the lower deck and we also amply prepared gunpowder as well. Yi Sun-Shin will not survive this battle. Let's go! We don't even have any turtle ship this time! And what the hell is this one-line-formation? Has he gone mad or something? I agree! Can't you hear that sound? We'll die for sure. We must think of something! What is this plan of yours?  Are you trying to suggest that we try and kill him like Bae Sul? No, that is not what I mean... Damn, I'm just anxious. We can't even send a message to Lord Kim. Let's go. Go where? I'll try to convince the Admiral. If I can't, I'll die tonight. Your Majesty... If you dismiss your navy now, I am afraid our enemy will go around the yellow sea and  march straight to the capital city where you are. My only worry is this. I still have 12 ships left to fight with. If we all combine our strengths and might We can surely fight them off. As long as I live, they will not... They will not dare to invade us again. Admiral...I have something to say to you. This battle is suicidal This is suicidal! Although you say we can fight them off by luring them to Blood Isle Without our turtle ship, it seems unlikely that we could win Please reconsider this decision and think of the future. Admiral! Is this really what you think? If you can't reconsider, then please have me killed. I'd prefer to die by your sword. If this is truly what you think then, all right. Assemble everybody in front of quarters tonight. Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Have you two brought what I asked for? Yes, sir! Pour it! What are you waiting for? I said pour it! -You heard what the Admiral said! -Yes, sir! -Burn it all! -Yes, sir! Admiral! Please don't! Admiral! Please ! Admiral, this is not the way to go!  Stay back! What a shame it is that many of you still wish to live! We as soldiers  cannot and should not avoid death! You wonder, if we can survive if we avoid this battle? Do you believe you will be safe if you hide? Mark my words I burn this place so that we could die out there on that water, fighting There is no place to go no place to hide Do not fear death If you wish to live you will find death If you wish to die, you shall find life There is a saying If one man does his duty he can defeat thousands. Is that not our situation? Father... How do you intend to use this fear? So this is Captain Bae's son? Yes sir.  He's the one who brought Junsa's message for you instead of Im Jun Young. Luckily he escaped because Junsa found him. This was your father's.  Will you take it? What is your name, son? I am called Soo Bong, sir.  Your father and I fought side by side for six years in this war. I will not forget you or your father. I have a wish, sir Go ahead. I'd like to be part of your crew. I want to help you. If you promise to stay out of harm's way, I will grant your wish. Thank you sir This is crazy... Port of Hae-Nam Mother... This may be the last day of my life. I just hope my death will not be in vain. Admiral You did well I am Hae-Yi. I came to help. You have my gratitude. Your presence gives me strength. Admiral! Welcome back. Sound the attack. Sound the attack! Depart now! Myeongnyang Strait 8 AM  Set up the One-Line-Formation The current is strong. Row harder! We must remain in control! Row harder! We cannot have our ship fall back! Row harder!  Get rid of it. -What is that? -What the hell is that big black mass? Other ships are falling back!  Soo Bong, I think we boarded the wrong ship! You didn't know this was the main fleet? That's what I'm saying! Why is the main fleet going forward? I will raise the communication flag and tell them to come back! Leave them be.  But sir... Put the ship's anchor into the water  and get ready for a possible close combat. Put the anchor into the water! how come Yi Sun-Shin is not putting up a command flag? Look at his men. Even if he put up one, would they listen? Send the first battalion. First battalion! Charge! Turn the ship to the right side and get the cannons ready. Get the cannons ready! Stop the ship and turn it to the right side! Hurry up! Captain Nah! Captain Song! Aim all our cannons at the front line Aim all our cannons at the front line! Aim it! Snipers ready! Fire! It's speeding up!  Archers ready! Now! Fire!  Fire! Speed up and turn the ship to the left!  Fire! Watch out!  Now! Yi Sun-Shin is attacking the ones in the front Kurushima's men are in chaos. He's neither moving nor backing down. Wonder what he's waiting for... How about we join forces and attack together? No. Let's wait. Fear does not discriminate. It can equally affect both sides. Because they too, are afraid of me because of their past defeats. Fear does not discriminate... Is that all? Is that how you use fear? If we can somehow transform that fear into courage.... Send the second battalion and push harder. Second battalion, charge! Kurushima is pushing hard. He claims to be the expert Let's wait and see. Just wait and see. The victory is ours. They will be crushed. The current is in our favor. Admiral, the current has turned our ship so much that it is interfering with our aim. Cut the anchor and just ride the current towards the Blood Isle. Yes, sir. Caught you. Fire! Bring me the pole! Row harder! We cannot let the ship get hit!  Admiral, we must put the flag up and call them over! We won't last long without their help! Captain, change the artillery to smaller cannons. Then prepare for close combat. Soldiers, prepare for close combat! Charge! Now! Fire! Charge! Kurushima is winning! Yi Sun-Shin tried to hold as long as he could But it looks like it's over Fuck it, we're all fucking dead! Admiral!!! Admiral! Admiral! Take the rest of the cannons up on this deck and move them downstairs! Aim them at the enemy ships' lower deck can you do that? We might die trying... Just tell me you'll get it done! yes Admiral! I'm counting on you! Stack multiple cannons and aim at their ships! Yes sir! Hurry up and go get the gunpowder and cannons from the armory! Soo Bong, no! It's dangerous! Move all of these! Hurry up! Admiral! We are ready! soldiers get down! Everyone get down! Is that how you use fear? If you can somehow turn that fear into courage That courage will be infectious  But father... How can you turn such fear into courage when they are so scared out of their minds? I will have to die... Could it be really over? Whoa! The main fleet is alive and well! They're alive! Kill them all! Damn those motherfuckers! Wait, I wanna kill them too! Let's go kill some Japanese! Speed up, gentlemen! Myeongryang Strait, 2 PM (mild current) It's the whirlpool. Yi Sun-Shin... There's a reason why you refuse to leave that Isle. My lord, the current has changed and now the whirlpool has become ferocious. That's why on his side, the current is mild. From where he is, it will be easier to aim at us. Do you see that? Whoever gets that Isle, will win this fight. The battle wouls be over in a heartbeat. Before he settles there completely, speed up towards his ship! Sir, it's their main fleet. Call our captains over. Yes, sir. You're mine now! Admiral! Captain Ahn! I should be punishing you accordingly for disobeying me But since we are at war right now,  You must focus on fighting the enemy off You must protect Blood Isle. Do I make myself clear? Yes, Admiral! Captain Song, we must move to Mok-Joong port. Absolutely, sir! Move towards Mok-Joong port! Perfect timing, sir. Explosion will be massive. Yi Sun-Shin's pathetic attempt to lure us will not work. Our main fleet will continue on towards the isle as you commanded. Sir!  There's a strange boat coming towards our way! Bring in the archers. -Yes, sir! Fire! We must hurry! Pump it out! Hurry! What the hell? Oh my god, I'm free! Im Jun Young? Junsa! Gunpowder?! He says that ship is full of gunpowder! Also, Im Jun Young is on that ship! Are they not answering? Reload! Sir, there is no answer! honey, wave something so that they can see this... You cannot let this ship go to our Admiral! Sweetheart, do it! There you go.. that's my girl.  Let's wave something!  Sir, look over there! There's a strange boat going towards our main fleet! -Prepare to fire ! -yes sir! Aim! Fire away! You did well... I am glad I saw your face one last time See you on the other side... Admiral, their main fleet is approaching fast! They're coming at us! Row faster! Yi Sun-Shin, you're finished!!! Close combat! Board their ship! Kuroda! Hurry up and get our ship ready! Shall we back him up? Everyone, we need your help! Soo Bong! Soo Bong! Yi Sun-Shin, I'm coming for you!  Sir! Our ships have come to our aid! Kimura! Hurry up and follow them! Sir, we can't! Our ships are trapped in that whirlpool! Aim! Fire! We must call for a back up! You don't understand, do you? They are not coming. Should we send back up? Yi Sun-Shin... you... Are you Japanese or are you Korean? Yi Sun-Shin!!! Admiral, I'm sorry but our ship cannot hold on much longer... Admiral! We will get you out of there! Admiral! Our officers are coming! We must hurry before they get into a formation!  Why aren't you speeding up? The current has changed.  I know that! Tell them to row harder!  It's all about speed at this point!  Speed is the only way to win! Speed up! Don't let go!  When the hell can I get off this ship? It worked! Sir! Listen up! No way We're gonna crash!  What is this, a suicide mission? What the fuck! Please hold on...please! That crash...! It's the turtle ship! Was that his plan all along? They're running away! Fire away! Yi Sun-Shin... Retreat! Let's go back. The current is back to normal. We got 23 Japanese soldiers here! 17 here! We got 3 Japanese officers and 9 soldiers! Even if Japanese want to take us, they can't! We're too good!  -Eat some of this -I'm eating already! you know, earlier I gave one of them Japanese bitches death glare then they shit their pants! I'm cool like that I wonder if our descendants will ever understand how much shit we had to go through for them? If they don't, then they're assholes Now that we're alive and well, let's go see our wives and kids have some water! Why, isn't this taro? How wonderful it is to be alive and eat this Admiral! What shall we do... With all this hatred between us... Father  how on earth did you think of using whirlpool as a weapon? Father.. You said something? I was asking you about the whirlpool. It was such a good timing. Heaven helped us. If that is true,  then couldn't it also have turned out really bad for us? yes, that's true... If it wasn't for the people who came to save me. You think people helped us? Not the whirlpool? What do you think? Which do you think was more of a miracle? 1592 AD July Han-San Island  That thing over there What the hell is that?
