 Here's to our little bug. Bon voyage. Janik would probably still be alive if he hadn't met you. You think he wanted this? Who cares what he wanted, if this is the outcome. But don't worry, you'll get over it. A guy like you? - Can't be sad for long, right? - Paul... Hey. Come on. Hey. You and the cops, I can't believe it.

 Or what was it, secret service? Man! You of all people, working with people like that! I don't get it. But you know what? I don't give a shit. I don't care what Philipp does or did with whoever. And I don't care if some assholes - are after him for it. Do you hear me? - He's got to you this much? Let me tell you who Philipp is. - Beat. - Please. - I don't want to hear it. - You don't know who he is. I want to tell you. - Beat. - Paul. Philipp... Your godson is in hospital.

 Jonathan will die if he doesn't get a new heart. I need Philipp. All I want is help for my son, Beat. So leave Philipp alone, please. Okay? Leave him alone. Because otherwise you'll be responsible for the next person dying. Jasper was right. Evil is always present in goodness. Evil is always present in goodness. Hi. How's Johnny? Well, he's in the hospital. Didn't Paul tell you? Yes, he did. Man! He's not himself anymore. And you? I only shower when Paul's there. I'm afraid I'll miss the call we've been waiting for so long. Are you going away? For a few days, yeah. When you're going through as much shit as we are, you hear every tip there is about how to stay strong. Can I offer you one of them? Good. Then I'll just say this. I have no idea what's going on between you and Paul, but you can always come to us, okay? And no one in this family is ever going to stop loving you. Saying your goodbyes? Where will you go? I'm here for you. You know that. Where's the boy? There was a little boy at the farm. About six or seven. Syrian or something. No. As far as I know, when we closed down the hospital, there was no child that age... - Hello. Good morning. - Morning. Sorry for barging in. My name is Lucia. I'm a friend of your grandson's. I've spent days looking for Beat. He won't answer his phone. No one knows where he is. To be honest, I'm a bit worried. Why come to me? I dropped him off here once. He was dead-tired, fell asleep on the way. Told him it wasn't the best state to visit his grandma... but he'd set his mind on it. Take a seat. Thank you. - Would you like something to drink? - No thanks. You have a lovely home. So you're a friend of Beat's? Yes. Then you can tell me all about him. Probably not. Of course not. He leads a wild life. I'm really very worried about him. I think that's great. Great? Only because... you haven't known each other for long. Did he tell you that? Yes. Beat always really wanted to find somebody from his family. Are you alright? It's all shit. Why were you so hard on him? I wanted him gone. They never stop. Your whole life. - Who are you talking about? - German Intelligence. Criminal police. They don't leave you in peace. Ever. What would German Intelligence want? Perhaps you're one of them as well. This is how I live. All these years. [VEHICLE] MONIKA... Okay. Now you got it. - RE-REGISTERED WOLLKOWSKI TO LIETZ - Listen... It's not about me. It's about the boy. You must do something, please. You always tried to protect him. That's why you left. If you want to protect him now, you have to come back. TERRORISTS So what's your husband doing this evening? - Where is he? - What would you like to hear? Anything. With the group, discussing new goals. Do you love him? Lie to me. Yes, I love him. Humor me. Do you know who you're sitting with? Who is this woman? Who is the woman that consumes you so? Will you tell me? She's married. You have to share her with another, and you like that, right? She hurt you. Yeah. I hurt you. I caused you pain. Because you can only love a woman you must share. Who doesn't see you for what you are. Do you regret that? Am I meant to believe you'd leave your husband for me? You're lying to me. Yes, I'm lying for you. Now who am I? Does it make any difference? Yes, it does. - I'm only her stand-in. - You're using me. My feelings. My stupidity. I'd have done anything for you, but you just walked out on me. Like a dumb kid. It was 20 years ago, but I'll never forgive you. Never. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to dance in your blood. Of course it was a success. But it wasn't our job. It was as if a running back in a football game breaks the 100m world record, but his team loses the game. Sorry, but given the crimes, I'm not sure what to think of that comparison. Come, Emilia, you know what I mean. We got distracted. And our target heard the warning shot. All tracks were covered. Accessories were murdered. Nothing linking Vossberg to the illegal organ trade can be proved. And he quit his job at Mehlbeck. Our operation against Philipp Vossberg is over. This is insane. Vossberg will continue and Mehlbeck will simply replace him. Is there anything else we should know? We're still searching for the person who warned them about the raid on the farm. We're checking the timelines prior to the raid, starting from the moment that you found Beat. The investigation is ongoing. The number of suspects is decreasing. You should go get a salad or something. You look a bit pale. So? I don't think anyone's listening here. Shoot. You told me recently about your Lyme Disease. I think I know who the tick was. I figured it wouldn't take you long to find out. Holger Wollkowski and Birgit Claasen were third generation Red Army Faction. They'd gone to ground. But we'd found them. And as it always goes, we wanted more. We wanted to see what contacts they still had, if we could still get information before we arrested them and got nothing out of them at all anymore. They were living a normal life together with their young son. That was in 1994, while I was still with German Intelligence. I... began a relationship with Birgit. Relationship... with... Mama! I thought I had her under control, but as I suddenly stood there, alone, in the parking lot by the Tropical House and she and her comrade vanished from one moment to the next, I knew that it was her who had me under control. Does Luna know about this? Not yet. What's the price for your discretion? You must have a price. Beat. You're still in touch with him. Beat has lost everything, and it's your fault. - I won't let you use him anymore. - I feel very attached to him. You want him close, you want his trust. But it's not Beat you want. You're waiting for someone else. For Birgit Claasen. She'll come back one day, right? And if not to you, then at least to her son. Did you give Beat a phone? I want his number. All alone? You're working for Philipp Vossberg? Certain people want to protect him. I work for them. - Which people might they be? - Oh, Richard! Mossad? CIA? Who do you work for? On the side? And you? Who do you work for? For ESI? For Europe? Or for yourself? Think long and hard about what you do with what you've discovered. If I fall, you fall too. It's a good starting point. You have a hold over me. I have a hold over you. Do we have a deal? We do. Brought something for you. I didn't arrange to meet you. I want to help you. What about Vossberg? You can help me with that. Help stop the feeling it was all for nothing. That I haven't thrown my life away for nothing. I'm sorry. My friend was murdered. I'm sorry about that. His murderer's sitting in his villa. I'm sorry about that. My life is totally screwed. I'm sorry, okay. It was thoughtless to use you, but I always tried to protect you. I came because I want you to enter a witness protection program. A new life? Does that mean in this life Vossberg doesn't get punished? - Where's the boy? - What? The boy. The little boy from the farm. The boy. The boy! Beat? Boom! You're the boy. What are you doing here? Come with us. Don't be afraid. We are all here, the whole family. Come on. No! No! Stay here! Younis. I thought you were swimming. Come here. The sausages are done. You wanted at least ten. - Younis, come on. - Don't be scared. Who are you? What do you want? Beat. I'm a friend of Philipp's. I see. Well, if that's the case... come on up, young man. - Boom! - Boom. You and your "boom"! Come on. We have fireworks. Big fireworks. Everything is big. No. Stay here. - What are you doing here? We gotta go. - Hanging out. And you? - Where's Janine? - At the hospital with Jonathan. Calm down. Why are you here? - I hope you're hungry, young man. - No thanks. Younis, take it easy or you'll hurt yourself. I'm Edgar. This is my drugged-up friend Beat. And he's leaving again. Beat... - Boom! - Yeah, you and your "booms"! Philipp's inside if you want to talk to him. - He doesn't. Right, Beat? - He should be out here by now. - Dude, fuck off. - Have a beer. Beat. Philipp will be back out any minute. Leave, please. How come the boy's here? Philipp is taking care of him. And where did he get him from? Philipp has a good friend at the Federal Office. At the Federal Office? Where? On a farm in Brandenburg? No. Here. Here in Berlin. Philipp told me the boy was completely distraught when he got here. But look at him now. Well... He's got everything that he needs. Oh, there you are! We've got a visitor. Okay. - Boom. - Sorry it took so long, folks. I thought we were out of vodka. I had to search the entire house. So, three... with vodka, and two without. - You've brought one for our guest? - I've been making one extra for days, because I always knew you'd end up standing here before me someday. But... you kept me waiting quite a while. Come on, Younis, let's eat. Come. Younis, come on. Time to eat. Philipp. I don't have... Come on, take a seat. - Younis... - Come grab a bite. Enjoy. Beat has come to shoot us all. No joke. Look what's stuck in his jacket. Have I introduced you yet? - Edgar. - Yeah. Exactly, very attentive. He's my father. Well? Dad, what do you think? - He just shows up here to kill us all. - Philipp! - Oh, come on! - I don't know. It doesn't matter, Dad. I know. It was always that way. He doesn't know anything. I know. And... I also know that you can't shoot us. You're furious. But weak. Younis. Tell us what you've been up to today. What did you do? I woke up. I played on Playstation. And I got in a car. Yeah, just a lot of shit. What's your plan with the boy? Be a dad. Like this one here. Alright, maybe a little different. I don't think I'll ever become the biological father of the likes of this. - But I'm intrigued by the experience. - You're a sick asshole. - Hey, Beat! - Younis, don't take this the wrong way, but I won't translate that! - I don't know the Arabic for "asshole". - It's "al ahmaq". Okay, I'll... I'll put some more on the grill. I'm sure you're still hungry. Do you know what your son does? Are you really his father? - Yeah. - Yeah, well, he's more like a mommy with a deep voice. Oh, Paul, I love you. I like your sense of humor. What in God's name are you doing here? He's enjoying the delights of a new friendship. Done. Isn't that cute? It's all he knows in German. - What is wrong with you? - "Done". Philipp promised he'd help Jonathan. - Can I go play again? - Yes, sure. And Philipp invited me over so we can discuss the details of how to proceed with Jonathan. - And you show up here, man... - And who do you think I did it all for? - Who do you think I did all this for? - Calm down! Calm down! Okay, and that brings us at last to the good news of the day. Paul. I have a matching heart for your son. What? Really? Really? Hey! Thank you. Or perhaps I should say it's already - here. - Okay. - He's playing with us. - Playing, right. Exactly right. Let's play. - Philipp. - Younis. - Philipp. - Paintball! Yeah! Come on. It'll be great. Beat. - You waking up now? - Beat. Hey. Beat. No. No. Are you crazy? - Shit. - Don't you get it? Don't you understand - that he'll kill the boy for it? - He wouldn't. - Yes he will. He will. - He wouldn't. Philipp has killed people and taken their organs. He's a monster. - The boy, you mean he'd... - Yes, he would. - What's going on here? - Hey, guys, enough serious talk. This is a chillout day with the guys. Sorry, Paul, that one's mine. We always play this way. It doesn't really matter, but... It's important to Younis. Having rituals, set rules. Yes, he's traumatized, the poor thing. So, how shall we play? I'd like to include you. I'm not playing anymore. But you came here to shoot. You can practice a bit. Before things get serious. Come on, Younis. Let's play over there, okay? Come on. Philipp, I don't think this is the time to play paintball. It is. What do you plan to do? The boy, you're not going to... I'll make you this offer. You get a matching heart for your sick son. And in that way you save his life. For decades to come, he'll be able to enjoy music and women and... drugs. All that I ask of you is to shoot your friend. You want me... to shoot Beat with this? That is the price of your son's heart. Isn't it an interesting question? What are you prepared to sacrifice to make at least some of your shit happen? I'd do anything for my son. What will you decide if I make you choose? Fuck. Paul, come on. Do it. I can't. Boom. - I... I... - It's okay. It's okay. - You shoot me? - I can't. The life of... Oh, God! So this is it. Yeah? That's where we're at? You two... Sticking together, huh? Beyond death. You damn assholes. You goddamn... assholes. You want to prove something to me, to show me? You want... Well, what do you want? To teach me? Teach me? But I'm supposed to give you the answers, huh? Younis, don't run away. It's all okay. It's just a game. Younis! Is this any of your business, Dad? Did I ask you? Have you ever told me anything that I didn't already know? Younis! Younis! Hey, hey. I'm not going to hurt you. I won't hurt you. Hello? Where's Beat? No. No! Someone wants to talk to you. Hello. It's Grandma. Listen. Emilia has something for you. You can trust her. Do you understand? They must be in their sixties now. - What if they don't recognize me? - I'm sure they will. I'm scared. Come on. Let's go. - What? - I'll explain. Trust me. Come on. - He was following us. - Who was? Diemer. He's been looking for your parents for a long time. - Why? - They were in the Red Army Faction. And they fled from him back then. Are they dead? I don't know. But maybe you should take a vacation. That's all I have.
