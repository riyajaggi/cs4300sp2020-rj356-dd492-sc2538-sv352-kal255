 Alkim Önerk was born in Berlin on November 2nd, 1995. He was recruited by a drug dealer at Kottbusser Tor when he was sixteen. At nineteen by a Salafist preacher in Neukölln. He was last seen in Baiji, Iraq. In October 2017, we lost track of him. Evidently he managed to slip back into Germany undetected. It's still unclear exactly what he was doing here. The body found by Berlin police yesterday on Fromme Strasse was his. He wasn't even 24 years old. - So that's the situation? The police know the main suspect from the club is not dead. The only unidentified person from that evening was this man.

 Your video conference with Brussels... Shall I put you through? In a minute. We assume that he's the individual who killed the two girls, disemboweled them and hung them up. I wanted to show them all, you know? Look here! The music is playing. But on the inside, you're hollow. You dance, but your insides are ripped out. But of course, they all looked away, ran away, and now they're having their gin and tonic and ketamine cocktail, trying to forget it all. - Shut it! - Beat, you gotta try this! I didn't kill those girls. They came to me, dead already.

 I swear. My journey's almost over. I know that. Now it's your turn. Beat Have a nice trip. This is sick! How's it going with the club promoter? What was his stage name again? Beat. Beat. Is he onboard yet? I'm afraid I need a bit more time. I had hoped for a better answer. Despite using drugs, he doesn't want any police protection. And despite his huge debts, he doesn't want money. Then find out what he does want. We're running out of time. And money. We've pursued Vossberg for so long. We've tried so hard to get him. We've invested so much money into this operation. If we don't act, other agencies may get our quarry first. Didn't you always tell me we needed this man, Richard? Yes. Yes, I did. You wanted him so badly. So... Oh hey, Beat! Hey! So, how's it going? You doing okay? That was some pretty sick shit, huh? By the way, your godson would love to see you in the daytime. Johnny'll think you're a vampire. Seriously, he doesn't know who you are anymore. Bye, sweetheart. - Ciao. I'm going jogging. Bye. Why all the banging? - Don't have a key. Ahoy Bubu, how you doing? - Awesome. Hey, I got a call from the young DJ that Sundström has a crush on. You have a meeting now at Café Lot. Got it on your radar, or did you forget? I'll do it. Chill. - Thanks for doing that. The guy's an idiot, but super cute. You're renovating? Or should I say, your silent partner is? We open when the Health Department gives us the nod, so we're using the time. Philipp put some cash in... - Yeah, yeah. Who are those guys? Chill, they aren't people who'll string up bodies or rob your "home". They're Philipp's business partners. - No, man, they're assholes. Open your eyes. - Ah, man Isn't that a bit unfair? Just because they spend more on haircuts than you? People like that come here because Berlin is what it is, and gentrify it into another Stuttgart. Philipp's a good guy. You'll really like him. That's awesome. So I can skip getting to know him. I guess you didn't come to insult my partner, right? I'd like to have my key back. The new keys are all taken, but you'll get yours soon, okay? So those guys have my key now? We had our first party in a car paint-spraying shop. We got the drinks with a fake ID. We hoped that 100 people would come. How many turned up? 800. - 800. Man! We were a hit. Maybe, from that day on, we were... screwed. Here's to the weekend! - To the weekend! We start by taking out the bass, okay? Then just high notes. Really high, yeah? And then okay, real, real slow, dude. Then a real-soul, sexy-techno sound-wall. Techno-oid. - An absolute steal! Soul what? And heavy bass. Gotta boom. I can create this kind of psychedelic atmosphere. - You're a genius! Yo man, I always have a bomb-ass track I can pull out, no problem. Hi, Beat. - And I also... It's me, Mikkel. We talked last year. In "About Blank". - Here's my tape. - Okay. You're doing that fetish party again soon at the "Building Block? Can you get me on the guest list? Plus one. Or let's do plus two. I have a better idea. Just buy the club. Then you can put yourself and your shitty friends on the list every night. And you won't have to ass-lick guys like me. You lost it? I was just asking. - Yeah. And I just gave you an answer, right? - What's your problem? So now I have a problem? Me? Asshole. Would it be too harsh? Hey! What the fuck? Leave it, leave it. - That wasn't cool. You, get out of here, and I mean right now. I salute you, dude, that was awesome! I salute you, bro, awesome. How'd you know I'm here? You got me bugged? I want to introduce you to someone. Didn't you get that I don't wanna talk to you anymore? Okay, here's the deal. Talk to my guy, say no, and it's over. Or I'll be breathing down your neck for a long time. You want that? With herbs and bacon. - Shut up! You're making me hungry. And then you just add some sauerkraut and potatoes. It's a classic. Oh, I'm hungry as a bear right now. - And I could eat a horse. What's that smell? Shit, something's burning. Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop. After them! Younis! After them! What's going on here? Stop! Come back! Let's go! Shut the fuck up, all of you! It's open, get in. My name is Richard Diemer. I'm honored, you're pulling out all the stops. I thought we could treat ourselves to a nice view for our meeting. Please, sit. Thank you. Sweet. Yup. I love this city. I was born here. Look, the parliament building. If you want to know what freedom is, I recommend listening to the last speeches made there in 1933. We work for the European Security Intelligence, aka ESI. Officially we can't call it that. For us, Europe stands for the idea of "no more war." So, freedom, peace, human rights. - Europe Which Europe are you talking about? My Europe is in the club every night, for example, peaceful and free. Your Europe is a machine, corrupt, power-hungry. Can't argue with that. Europe ranges from asshole bureaucrats in Brussels to you. And we're in between. Sometimes assholes, sometimes cool. You know, dancing free and easy in a club can't be taken for granted. Believe it or not, that right must be defended. And what do you want from me then? I'm no computer nerd, no combat expert. You must know that. - Sure we know that. This conversation, Mr. Schlag - You can call me Beat. Beat, okay. This part is classified. You can speak to no one about this. If you do, it's high treason. I don't care about this country. Don't worry, I'll keep your secret crap to myself. It's part of my job too. It's not a dangerous mission. You'll never work under-cover. Always in public only. - I know that already. I'm to spy on people. She told me about five times. No way. Not just anyone. Philipp Vossberg. Intelligence is interested in proliferation, illegal distribution of missile technology. It's about logistics. Vossberg is associated with international organized crime. International organized crime rings? And that's not dangerous? Mirko Savic. Had a restaurant in Hamburg. Leo Brandner. Munich, high-end brothel owner. Vossberg buys into these places, to use them as fronts. Their murders couldn't be traced to him. Obviously, we thought about recruiting your buddy, Paul. He's nearer to Vossberg. So he ends up in a photo like this? We want to prevent that. That's why we're talking. Okay. I'm in. I'll be keeping my ears open. Logistics sounds harmless, taking things from A to B, right? Drive on. Come on, drive on! We know that you were adopted anonymously when you were six. What happened to your parents? - Disappeared. Just like that? - Yup. Just like that. Sorry about that. Some kids grow up thinking they'll always be surrounded by a loving family. Then there are kids who discover that in fact we're all alone. What do you know about your parents? Nothing. But you were already six though. Alright, we work in intelligence, we have access to information that others don't have. I'll see if I can find out something for you. Okay then Good luck. - Thank you. Nice, isn't he? - He's a professional manipulator. That's all. Gotta go, bye. Our guy hasn't been caught yet unfortunately. Who? - The one who strung up those girls in the club. I thought he was dead. That was someone else. And you're only telling me now? In passing? Komm runter, ich weiß es selber noch nicht lange. Calm down. I only found out hours ago. I feel like he's stalking me. - Maybe cut down on the drugs, then the feeling might go away. There's a way we can find out more about him. Why were you adopted anonymously? To eliminate any leads to my parents. Sure, but do you know why they did that? No idea. Mrs. Masurek. Good day. You don't remember, huh? I lived here for a while. Robert Schlag. Beat! Of course I remember. So, sit down. How're you doing? You know, not too bad. I've had a bit of bad luck. - Oh! Das ist... Frau Dr. Varela. This is Dr. Varea. She's checking out my mind state. Dr. Varea, Psychosomatic Clinic, Tempelhof. Hello. Pleased to meet you. - Hello. She's my therapist. I have to figure out a few things. Because I have these... Anxiety issues. Yeah, issues This visit is part of the therapy. Ich hab ja hier im Heim damals 'ne Menge Scheiße gebaut. I screwed up a lot when I was here under your care. And also afterwards. Not only here. For sure, but you weren't that bad. It's all in the past. We forgave you a long time ago. - That means a lot. But... Dr. Varea and I discovered in my therapy sessions that there was an incident, which made me feel... Come on, you can do this. Shame. Shame. Emotional integrity has nothing to do with intelligence. I'm looking for a boy. I'd like to... I'd like to say sorry to him. I must apologize to him, or I can't get closure. I understand. What was the child's name? Ich weiß den Namen nicht mehr. I don't remember. He was a short, dark-haired, quiet little kid, who used to wear these knitted shorts. Unremarkable. Even his mother said that. So what? So you don't really play sports. It's not a big deal. But your artwork is awesome. You sing real well. And you tell great jokes about blondes. Let the others play their dumb sports, huh? And you know what? In a few years it won't matter who's the best at sports anyways. Then other things will matter. Being cool, laid-back, funny, and here... brainy. Hm? Huh, sweetie? - But if I train, it'll get better. Won't it? Here, Johnny. But don't push yourself, okay? Dr. Varea? - A DJ from Spain. Did pretty well. - Yeah. You did a great job. Hi. I'm on another line right now. Leave a message if it's important. We're here, Tarek. Really. We've arrived. Wait. Something's missing. And? The murder suspect from the club, we know his identity. - Jasper Hoff. I was in a foster home with him. - How sure are you? Sure. I'm very sure. I recognized his photo. It's not our case, but it'll help the agency. It'll boost our image. I'll pass on the information. So From now on, it's about Philipp Vossberg. I've never spied on anyone before. You make it sound so awful. It is awful. You'll never do it with that attitude. You're helping us take down a big-time arms-dealer. You'll be saving lives. And I'll be shitting on my moral convictions. What moral convictions would those be? - Okay. You've really got a high opinion of me. To you, I'm just a party animal. Kratzt es deine Moral, wenn du dir Koks reinziehst? Do your morals stop you snorting coke every night? Ever think of the people who get killed for the stuff, or the warlords whose pockets you're lining? Fascinating. Never thought about it, but You're right! Sure! If I quit, everything will change. You've built a world-view with clichés of the "evil system", right? Isn't this great? We're getting along so well together. You're totally in love with me. - I don't have to be. My job is to get you through this and protect your best friend from Vossberg. So how do I do this? Act totally normal. And try to get as close to him as possible. What are you up to now? - Right now, you mean? Going home to my husband. You've never been to a club, right? That's not really my world. You don't know that if you've never been. I'll show you my club. You can leave if you don't like it. Would do you good, letting go and so on. And tell your husband he can come along. If you find one by then. Your boss doesn't need to know that we're out together. I'll call you. Yeah, for sure. Jasper Hoff, I know. Well done. I was caught off guard at first. But they only got the boy's name, nothing else. I didn't tell them anything more. It's also in your interest, right? And whoever walks through your door, asking about Jasper Hoff and the others, you tell them nothing and call me. Understood? Sure. It's nice to see you. We should do this more often. Come on. I need you now. - That's good, honey. You know how much I love hearing you say that. I've been waiting for you for so long. Aren't you a little early today? - Come on. Come, come on. - Yeah! - Come on. Yeah, yeah. I'm coming. - Come on, come on. Come. Oh, right, I forgot. And how long now? - A week. Well, the worst's behind you. Most people here start again after they hand in their smartphones. Crazy, huh? Nicotine deprives the body of calcium, and calcium deficiency leads to osteoporosis. Bone loss. We can do without that. Yeah, we have to take care of our health. That's right. Take the stick. This could work. Not that exciting. Sorry, it took me a bit longer. No problem. Shut the fuck up! Stay nice and quiet. "Take the merchandise. Search it, for weapons, phones, writing implements, food, lighters, collect everything. Take the merchandise from A to B." How hard can that be? What did you do? Rip hair off each other's balls? Look at him! Because of you, we had a major fuck-up on the highway. We lost valuable merchandise out there. Oh, God... Thanks. What a night. So beautiful. So, this look okay, or not? It's okay. Excuse me. Hey! What're you doing? Younis? Younis? Wake up. Wake up, little brother. Hey, doctor! Out of the way! Doctor? - Step aside, doctor! - You're a doctor? Move! Over here, man! I found the girl. You were too dumb to get her! Leave it to the pros. I don't even know our real name. Someone just called me Robert Schlag. That's not my name. Where did you live? You must have had friends. I was six. What did you just take? - A pill. Want one? - You take ecstasy now? The night is over. - Yeah. And the day is full of assholes. She must think, "Why was he even born, he just deforms the world with drugs." I don't. - I just shape the world into a reality I can handle. Okay. Look around, what do you see? The world is bad. - Yeah. And why is that? I wonder. You think there are too many losers like me, party people, fuck-ups. What would give me that crazy idea? It's true. We're all meant to be engaged, political, responsible. Shall we go? - Don't think you're better. I know you'd like to save the world, but you won't by supporting a system that's mostly to blame for the shit happening in the world. You can call me a coward, but I just wonder what you think of me. You came to me. You want me to join your club. Goodnight. Night. Take him to the car. Maybe you can get some sleep on the plane. I'm alright, thanks. - Good luck, safe flight. By the way, I have something that might be of interest to Beat. You do? - We may have found a relative of his. I couldn't find anyone. I have a good contact at the responsible authority. Mhm, cool. Cool. - But let's keep it quiet for now, Emilia, okay? Why? The kid needs to deliver first. Then maybe he'll get a little reward. I need Beat to trust us. Otherwise, this won't work. Keeping agreements is a must, also for us. He gets the carrot and the stick from us. That's how you raise kids, right? You may want to rethink that. Thanks for the ride. See you tomorrow. Paul... Hi. - Hi. Everything alright? - Yeah. All good. - Okay. Wanna meet up? Sure. No, you're not coming in. - What is it? Yesterday was enough. Drink your coffee somewhere else. We arranged to meet up! - Maybe, but not here! What's your problem? - Get lost! Dude! - Dude! What's up with him? No idea. Yesterday, things were all good. When was the last time we both got thrown out of someplace? Long time ago. Too long. I'm sorry, man. For all of it. Me too. First of all, here's your key. Okay, I don't wanna bitch anymore. The guy's your friend. Or at least, he's loaded. Anyhow, I'm your friend. So I'll say hi to him. The boss would like a word. Philipp? Beat. Have you ever had the experience of seeing someone from afar, that you really liked and... really couldn't wait to finally speak to? And have you had the experience that this someone... was a real asshole? I think that may just be the case with the two of us. What do you think? Listen. We both thought that, since we have to close down, we'll come back with a huge party, we'll make it a re-opening. For that, we'll lay down a lot of cash. And you'll be our master of ceremonies. Who else? That way, the club is back, the people are back, and you're back. Alright, whatever. I'm in. Mehlbeck Worldwide Logistics is one of the world's leading logistics companies. The company owns gigantic storage facilities and around 1,000 offices, employing 53,000 staff in 97 countries. A reputable company that a dangerous parasite has latched on to. This division answers only to Mehlbeck personally. We know this branch organizes the trade of illegal chemical and bio-weapons, plus missile technology. The head of this division is this man. Philipp Vossberg is cautious and very dangerous. He recently became co-owner of a Berlin techno club. It's in an old war bunker with 3-meter concrete walls and is bug-proof. We suspect that he uses this club to meet his business partners. I'm glad to announce that we've recruited an informant. This individual is with Vossberg as we speak. What's he gonna do in there now? - No idea. Listen to loud music? Dance? Sometimes he meets friends or business partners. He has a huge house, but it's way out of town. So the club comes in handy. So? What do you think of him now? He's not so bad, huh? Yeah, I think he's not so bad. Kiss my ass, man. You're jealous. You didn't tell me about him. - I screwed up. I'm sorry. It's okay. About the job... - I know what you're thinking.
