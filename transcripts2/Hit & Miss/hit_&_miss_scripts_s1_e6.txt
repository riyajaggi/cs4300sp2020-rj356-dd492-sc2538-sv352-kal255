 Hit & Miss (2012): Season 1, Episode 6 - Episode #1.6 - full transcript 
 Mia meets Claire, her mother, at a funfair but has trouble in persuading her to accept her as a woman and is attacked by her brother, who calls her a freak. She disappears but is tracked down by Ben, who admits he loves her, and Ryan, who says "Come home, Dad, we need you." Riley is about to admit to John's murder but Liam takes the rap for her instead. Mia carries out her first hit but bungles the second. She returns to the farm-house, and tells Claire, who has finally decided to accept her, and the children that they must leave. However Eddie turns up, telling Mia that unless he kills her he will be killed by the people who ordered the hit. He points his gun at Mia but Ryan appears and trains a shotgun on Eddie.

 - So where'd you grow up? - Everywhere. Nowhere. I grew up in a fairground. I can't get it out of me head. I saw him! The day he went missing! I am not gay. - I'm sorry, Mia. - What for? I'm so sorry. Both jobs need to be done on the same day. You know how it works. If I don't kill them, they'll kill you. -This job's really important, Mia. - I know. Come on.

 It's me, Mum. It's Ryan. Hello, Mum. Who's your friend? It's your brother. Hello, Philip. Ryan? It's Mia now. Dad was right. You are a freak. And you're a cunt, just like he was. Get out, you little freak. I've come to see Mum. And I said get out! Come on, Mum. You're coming with me. Mum. - Ryan! - Get out! Say that you're a real boy. A real boy. You know what it is. Say it. Say that you're a real boy. If you don't, I'll fucking scalp you, I... I swear to God. Say it. Say it. I'm a real boy. I'm a real boy. There's a good boy. There's a good boy. Riley, what are you doing here? I don't know. Are you ok? They found John. He's dead. Whoo! I did it, Penny. I killed John. I said I killed John. - Where the fuck is she? - She'll come back. When? She's been ages. - She might be working. - She would have told us. What happens if she's in another accident? Stop following me, Liam. Stupid bitch. I knew something like this'd happen. I knew she'd fuck up sooner or later. I'm gonna tell her as well when she gets back. Ryan. Is Mia here? No, she's not, mate. Why? We don't know where she is. She went missing at the fair the other night. Right. Come on. Have you seen our Mia, Levi? No. Levi? - What are you doing here? - Never mind about that. - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for Mia. She's gone missing. How did you know where to find me? -Mia brought us here one time. - How'd you get here now? Ben brought me. Fuck's sake. - Try there. - Thanks. Tell her I need to speak to her. D'you want me to come with you? You've got things to do here. I'll see you at home later, yeah? Fuck! Who is it? It's me! Ryan? Mia? What's happened? Mia, are you ok? -What are you doing here, Ben? - Mia, please listen. Please. I were pissed and I were... I were confused about us. But... it's made me realise how much I like you. And how much I want you. So you're not confused any more? It's all ok, is it? You're ok with me, with what I am? - Was she good, by the way? - Mia, don't... Just get out, Ben. Are you coming back? Please come home, Dad. How'd you find out where my place was? I went to see Eddie. He said he needs to speak to you. And Levi was there, at Eddie's. "Where the fuck have you been?" - Something came up. - "What? What came up?" I don't wanna talk about it. What about the second job? You were supposed to do them on the same day. "We could be in deep shit if you don't get it done soon." I know. I'm sorry. It'll get done tomorrow. Yeah, make sure it does. And no fuck-ups. What's going on? - They're arresting Riley! - What for? They wanna question her about John's murder. - Eh? - Fucking wanker. Stop it. She didn't do it. How do you know? Do you know who did? Did Uncle Liam kill John? - No. - So who did, then? I don't know. Why did he say he did? He must have had a good reason to. Why are you still working for Eddie when I asked you not to? It's got nothing to do with you. It's got everything to do with me. So are you gonna tell us what happened? Where have you been? I found out family's got fuck all to do with blood. Where you going? Hello? Lee, what have you done? I want Uncle Liam. - Ryan. - What... You know why you love yourself so much. Cos you haven't got the capacity to love anyone else. You're not human. You're a fucking animal. A heartless coward fuck. Do you wanna come with me, Mum? You're an animal, Ryan. You're just like he is. You're just like your father was. Do you know why he's like that, Mum, why I'm like this? Because you let it happen. And you were right the first time. Ryan's gone. I'm sorry, Mia. Let's go. Uncle Liam's gonna be fine, baby. Sometimes having a brother is better than having a superhero. Who's she? This is my mum. Mum, this is my son. Ryan. Do you want me to show you around? That'd be nice, Ryan. It's happening. I give you my word. We'll sort it tomorrow. - She better fucking had. - Mia? What's she gotta do? How many times do I have to tell you about asking fucking questions? Don't talk to me like a piece of shit, Eddie. Who the fuck d'you think you're talking to? Shut up! Shut up! Mum? What you doing? What you doing? I think she's had a shit. Is your baby gonna smell like that? All babies smell like that. -Have you got any nappies? - No. Have you got anything? Why'd you bring her here? Mum can't cope. Right, you get the food out of t'bucket and put it in t'trays. Mummy said Uncle Liam's gonna be fine. We'll go and visit him as soon as we can, ok? Just off to work. See you all later. We'll have a party, yeah? Show Mum how we do things round here? - I booked a room. -Certainly, sir. Your name, please? - Simon Richie. -How many nights' duration was it? - Three. -And how will you be paying? Cash. Fuck. Pack your things. We gotta leave. What's happened? I can't explain. Just please go pack. Tell us why. Levi, please, just trust me. - Are we in trouble? - No, just... -We're going away for a little while. - Where to? - I don't know. - Fuck that. -I'm going nowhere without Sophie. - Levi. Levi... Shit. Come on, let's go. I'll get it! - Who is it? - It's me. What? What the fuck? Don't upset her any more. Aye. What are you packing for? We're leaving. Mia, please, don't go. We can sort this out. Don't flatter yourself, Ben. I'm not going because of you. I love you. What happened? Ryan, he... he hit me. He said I'd best not upset you. Mia, I am so sorry for what I did. It's not about that, Ben. This can't work, can it? I don't care. Are you ready to go? We're not going anywhere without Levi. Ryan, where are you going? I'm going to say goodbye to the pigs. Still not back? One on one. One at a time, right? Go on. Go on. And another. I'm sorry, Mia, but if I don't kill you... They'll kill you.
