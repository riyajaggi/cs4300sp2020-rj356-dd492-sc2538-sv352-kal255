 Hit & Miss (2012): Season 1, Episode 4 - Episode #1.4 - full transcript 
 Whilst finally bonding with her young charges Mia is finding it hard to juggle domesticity with her work for Eddie, who refuses to let up on hits. A mysterious man temporarily kidnaps Leoni and, when he returns her, gets set upon by the family. He turns out to be Liam, Wendy's brother who has an interest in looking after the kids. Riley tells Mia she is pregnant and wants an abortion but Mia, feeling maternal instincts, dissuades her and offers to help her raise her baby. John arrives at the farm-house and demand Riley have an abortion. When she refuses he tries to strangle her but she shoots him dead with Mia's gun.

 I've no problem with you doing what you have to do for them. It can't have a bearing on what you do for me. Why have you got this ? - You're not their mother. - But I'm all they've got. I want you out by the end of the month. - I said I'd buy it off you. - No chance. - I'm a transsexual. - You've got a cock ? - I'm pregnant. - Get rid of it. I said fucking get rid. - John. - Get off ! - What about lover boy ? - It's got nothing to do with you.

 Everything's got something to do with me. Stash this for a while. Don't tell anyone, not even Mia. This is how it would work. Can I have a swig ? - Your dad'll go mental. - He wouldn't care. - I got a dad like that. - I didn't even know mine. See you soon. You Ok ? Hmm. I'm pregnant. I'm gonna get it sorted, though. I'm getting an abortion. You can't. Why not ? You just can't. What ?

 I'm 16 years old and it feels like I've already got three kids. But I can help you. We can both be mums together. Who's the dad ? It's better if he doesn't know. I'd want to know. I wish I'd known about Ryan. We can do this, Riley. We can do this together. What the fuck are you doing ? - I've not got any of these. - Is this all of 'em ? Yep. Nearly done now, kid. So what are you really doing here, Eddie ? What happened to keeping business and personal life separate ? I like it here. There's always something going on. I need a break. - Riley's... - Riley's what ? You can't afford a break. How will you pay for this place for the kids ? Scag dealer. Street level. Been half-inching from his supplier's profits. - When you gonna do it ? - Soon. You better had, Riley. I'm not fucking about. I will. Have you and Penny thought of any names for your baby ? Have you been talking to someone else about this ? Riley ? What ? - You've told her, haven't you ? - No. I can't fucking stand that bitch. - Two bulls can't reign in one pen. - What d'you mean by that ? Nowt. Just get that fucking sorted. Everything alright ? If evolution does exist, how come women only have two hands ? - Anything I can do ? - No, I'm fine. Look at this. I found it in the village. Sorry. I couldn't resist. - Can I come in ? - No. Seeing Sophie again ? Let me show you. What is it you do for Eddie ? Sorry. Go on, Gary ! That's yours, mate ! Go round him ! Go on ! - Go on, Michael. - That's it. Go on, lad. Drop it down the line, go on. Straight to him. Out here ! Covering you. Through your legs. That's it. Play. Good catch. - What are you doing here ? - I wanted to see you. Aye. - What's this ? - This is sports therapy. The players have got learning difficulties, mental health issues, that type of thing. When I stopped playing, I started doing this. Just helping out. Shall I come over yours later ? Ok. Alright, then, come on ! Keep it going ! I'm going out. Don't wait up for me. Jesus fucking Christ. I've gotta go. - Are you sure ? - I've got some work stuff. What, at this time ? Fucking hell. - Riley, what's wrong ? - Did you have a nightmare ? Where's Mia ? She must be working late again. Wait here. Come on. Let's get in. Jesus ! Come on, Lee. I'm gonna be late. - Not yet. Not ready. - I need to go. Come on. - Mia can take me. - Are you sure ? Ok. Hello ? What the fuck is he doing ? Where you going ? Never mind that. Where have you been ? Dirty little stop-out. You and Eddie seem to be getting on well. Yeah, it's nice having a bloke to talk to. - Is Leonie not with you ? - No. She's probably gone swimming with Riley. I'm starving. Anyone fancy fish and chips ? Yeah ! What's that dickhead doing ? I don't know. We're going for some fish and chips, John. Care to join us ? - What are we doing ? - Wait here. I won't be long. And don't get out of the car. Hello ? Everything alright ? Yeah. I've booked you an appointment. Just turn up. Otherwise I'll do it myself. Where's Leonie ? I thought you were taking her dancing. She said you were. I wasn't even at home this morning. When did you see her last ? - I think there was a man in the house last night. - What ? I dreamt I was asleep. When I woke up, there was a man standing by the door, but I didn't know if I was still dreaming. - Why didn't you tell me ? - How can I if you're not there ? - We should go to the police. - No. No police. Get in. How comes you weren't there this morning ? I mean, it wasn't late when you left mine. I told you, I was working. She'll be alright, little man. Don't worry. No, apparently she weren't in class. We just wondered if you'd seen her beforehand. Thanks. - I'm calling the police. - No, don't. - You ain't called them yet ? - No, she won't. Just leave it. We'll think of something. Why haven't you been in for your money ? I can't speak now. Something's happened. - What ? What's happened ? - Lee ! Where have you been ? With a man made of mud. Oi, stop ! No ! Oi, stop it !  Fucking kill him ! Get off him. Get off him. Oi, stop it ! Stop. Stop it, for fuck's sake. Let them carry on, Ben. Mia, I know this lad. He plays rugby with me. He wouldn't harm a fly. I don't give a fuck who he is ! If he's laid a finger on her, I'll fucking kill him ! It's Uncle Liam, Mummy's brother. Thanks for keeping an eye on them. - Leonie's not talking to us. - Where is she ? Upstairs. Says she's gonna tell Mum on us. I thought your mum was dead. She is. I knew Mum had a brother who's a nutter, but we never met him. We just thought he were locked up somewhere. Mummy said you should keep it. - What ? - That's what she said. What's wrong with you ? Nothing. There obviously is. I saw you before. I saw that look in your eye. You would have let them kill him. What was I supposed to do ? I've gotta protect them. They're my... - They're just children. - I know that, Mia. - It's just... - What ? Well, it's not very ladylike, is it ? What are you getting at, Ben ? Well, maybe there's... Maybe there's still some man inside of you. You fucking what ? Look, Mia, right, I am not gay. And I'm not a fucking man ! Go, Ben. Just fucking go ! You lot are mental. I love it. Off your heads on jam and bread. You Ok ? I've been thinking. I'm gonna keep the baby. I'll pick you up tomorrow, take you to the clinic. - I don't want to go. - Why not ? I've been thinking about it. What's there to think about ? Mum was about my age when she had me. And she was really happy. Stuck on her own with four little bastards. I'm not gonna be on my own. That fucking bitch. - You know, I swear to God, I'll... - You'll what, John ? What will you do ? Just get rid of the baby and get rid of Mia, or I will. Fuck you, John. Mia's staying and so's the baby. - Has Ben been in ? - No, love. Sorry. What the fuck did you say ? I'm keeping the baby ! Where's that whore when you need her now ? Now, I'll ask you again. What are you doing with it ? Keeping it. That's not gonna happen. Even if I have to beat it out of you myself. - Go clean up. - What you gonna do ? I've got a situation. So you speak to me when you need something ? - Kids could be back any minute. - Fuck's sake. You fucking owe me, Mia. Big time. - Carry on like normal. - Why aren't you freaking out ? What do you do for Eddie ? - I'm his book-keeper. - You must be good at it. - Why are you having a fire ? - Getting rid of some rubbish. - I'm gonna go to the police. - What, give birth in prison ? I saw him the day he went missing. - What the fuck ? - Don't talk to me like that. Don't fucking dare !
