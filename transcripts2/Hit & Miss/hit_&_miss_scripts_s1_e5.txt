 Hit & Miss (2012): Season 1, Episode 5 - Episode #1.5 - full transcript 
 Mia discovers John's body but dissuades the traumatized Riley from involving the police, instead calling in Eddie, who helps her chop up the body and get rid of it in pieces. Eddie also tells Mia he has two hits for her to take place in the same day. Mia has - fully-clothed - sex with Ben but is annoyed to find evidence that he has been with another woman whilst Riley's pants are found in John's car at much the same time that his head washes ashore .

Get him chopped up, dump the bits somewhere. Have to be quick. The kids could be back any minute. Fuck's sake. Is that his van outside ? I'll take that. When you've cleared up here, head for the beach. Give me a call when you're on the motorway. Riley's pregnant. John's the dad. He tried to kill her. This has nothing to do with me. Well, where did she get the gun ? She found it in my room. You fucking owe me, Mia. Big time. This needs doing, and soon. Take this. Help you sleep. Under the covers. Why are you having a fire ? - Just getting rid of some rubbish. - Where's Riley ? She's in bed, which is where I'm going. A fire this late at night ? Do you wanna stay here ? Time for bed, you guys. I'll take her. Night-night. Night-night. God bless. Sweet dreams. You're really sweet with them. - Mia, Ben's here to see you. - Shit. You alright ? I'm fine. Where's Riley ? Still in bed. Are you sure everything's alright ? I'll be down in a minute. Mia, I'm sorry for what I said. There's a reason why I acted like I did with Liam. But it's got fuck all to do with what you said. Ryan's my son. The woman I told you about. The woman I slept with. It was Wendy. Oh, fuck. And that's when you was a... We lived together for a while. Before I started transitioning. Why didn't you tell me ? I was worried that if you knew I was a dad, How could you ever see me as a woman ? Look, Mia, I'm so sorry for what I said. But... I've gotta go. Pint of lager and a whisky chaser, please, mate. Rode hard and put away wet, eh ? Aye, summat like that. You OK ? - I've brought you something to eat. - I'm not hungry. Will you try and eat something ? I can't get it out of me head. Every time I close my eyes, I see him. You need to carry on like normal. Back into a routine. Try not to think about him. How can I not think about it when I have a constant reminder growing inside me ? You'll get over this, Riley, I promise. Why aren't you freaking out ? When you're going through hell, you've just gotta keep going. Yes, can I help you, love ? Can I have a vodka and tonic and a whisky and coke, please ? Alright ? What's your name, then ? - Laurie. - Nice to meet you, Laurie. Liam. Could you do me a favour and keep an eye on Riley ? Be nice to have you around the house. For the kids. - You hungry ? - No, I've had something in the village. - Ryan ! - Is Riley still in bed ? - What's wrong with her ? - Leonie ! - Where have you been ? - With Aaron. His dad's gone missing. He thinks he's on one of his benders. Probably. Ryan, get my recipe book out. Yay ! Takeaway ! You're acting really weird, Riley. They know something's up. I think you should tell them you're pregnant. No ! You're gonna have to tell them sooner or later. Leave me alone ! I'm gonna do it. Do what ? Tell the kids I'm pregnant. Axe is blunt as fuck. About time we got a new one anyway. So I'm gonna be an uncle ? Yes ! - Who's the dad ? - You don't know him. Is he from round here ? He doesn't want anything to do with the baby. So we're all gonna have to help Riley as much as we can ? Shit ! - I thought you were a virgin. - I wish. I can't do it, Mia. I just can't. I'm gonna go to the police. What, give birth in prison ? Listen to me, Riley. He deserved to die, and you deserve to live. When that little baby comes, you're gonna love it more than anything you've ever loved in your life. But it's his baby too. It's not gonna be easy, but it is gonna be OK. And I will be there for you, I promise. - Where you going ? - It's work. I won't be long. - You got everything you need ? - I'm on my way now. - Alright. - What's in these boxes, Eddie ? What did I tell you about asking fucking questions ? Sorry. I saw him ! The day he went missing ! Who went missing ? John. How d'you know what day he went missing ? And you are ? Riley. And how did he seem when you saw him ? Did he say anything to you ? I need to take your details. Answer that. Take a message. Hello ? Who's this ? Levi. - What the fuck ? - Eddie told me to take a message. Just tell him the job's done. She said the job's done. We'll have to get you a mobile so I can contact you whenever. Fancy staying for a beer ? Alan ! Couple of beers, mate. Help ! Aaron ? Please, help ! Everything's gonna be OK. - You called an ambulance ? - Yeah. Go and get some blankets, towels, whatever. What are you doing here, Mia ? Came to see John. Stuff about the house. Where is he ? Your guess is as good as mine. I swear to God, I'll fucking kill him when he comes back ! Go and wait at the door. We'll take over now. Just step away so we can get to the patient. Thank you very much. Come on. Come on, please. Brandy ? Please, Wayne. - Hello ? - Yeah, it's me. Please can I come and see you, please ? Ben, are you drunk ? I'm sorry, Mia. What for ? I'm just... I'm just so... I'm so sorry. Don't be daft, Ben. Hello, Mia. Levi, how much have you had ? Just two. Honest. Mia and Ben, sitting in a tree. Shit. I'm gonna spew. - What the fuck ? - What ? He's been running a few errands for me. He's a good boy. I like him. - He won't be doing it any more. - It's not your decision to make. - Yes, it fucking is ! - Don't talk to me like that, Mia. Don't fucking dare ! Be at the restaurant tomorrow. I've got a big job for you. So what do you do for Eddie again ? - I'm his book-keeper. - Right. You must be really good at it, then ? You're staying here. You're not going anywhere in that state. - What are you doing later ? - I'll give you a call. - Thanks for last night. - Any time. Bloke with the beard's an undercover cop.

Both jobs need to be done on the same day. I can do this. I know you can. If only there were two of you. If only. - This job's really important, Mia. - I know. I know. Where d'you think my dad is ? Don't know. - What if something's happened ? - Like what ? Like if he's been killed by gangsters or something. Round here ? More likely to be abducted by aliens. - How you feeling ? - Fine. I don't want you working  for Eddie any more. Why not ? - I just don't. - Why ? I've said it and that's final. You can't tell me what to do. You're not my mum. Fuck it. Are you at home ? Good. I'm coming over. Fuck me. Fuck ! Look. - It's your brother. - Ryan ? It's Mia now. Get out ! They found John. He's dead. - Mia, don't... - Get out, Ben. I did it, Penny. I'm looking for Mia.
