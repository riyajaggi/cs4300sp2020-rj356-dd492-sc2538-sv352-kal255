 Violet, honey? Your door is stuck. Probably swollen from the heat. I'll get it. Dang, it's real stuck. Here, let me try. Good Lord, mother! It's not stuck. It's barricaded with a case of Glucerna diabetes bars. Vi, why on earth would you barricade yourself in your room with my blood sugar snacks?

 It's called privacy. Bye. She's entered the privacy phase. The rebellion has started, Jenny. Violet is lost to us! Oh, don't be so dramatic. She's still our little girl. Watch this. Vi, 90-Day Beyoncé is coming on. Fave garbage-y reality show. Want to watch ironically... while I watch unironically? Nope, bye. See? I'm not worried.

 She's just a teenager now. Aren't you even a little bit curious what she's doing in there? She's a good girl. She's... oof, probably shouldn't say it... But a nerd. And nerds never get up to anything. It's a mirage! A smoke screen! At her age, you tried to play the angel, but I was on to you. There was nothing to be on to. Ready to go to Jacksonville? Jenny, I am so glad you dumped that old guy. I didn't. He dumped me. What?! He dumped you?! I'm gonna dump him! Eight ball, corner pocket. Brenda, what did you do? I did what I had to do. I killed a man who hurt you. The hell you did! All you did was beat me with a Snapple bottle! - He's alive! - Run! Oh, Lord! You almost dug yourself an early grave and dragged me in with you. Oh, like you were a perfect child. I was. All I did was go to Sunday school on the regular. You legal? I am in Oklahoma. Oklahoma it is. - We've got to get in there. - I know! Not like that! This secretive behavior is how it all starts. Locking the door, not opening the door, saying sarcastic things through the door. Teen sarcasm is just a slippery slope to teen pregnancy. Y'all need to stop. I've seen this before. You get fixated on something and spiral out to the worst possible conclusion. Why does she need her backpack? It's summer. - Wine? - Menthols? And what the hell is this, Violet? It's called a switchblade. Google it. Oh, no, my baby's doing knife crimes. I'm stepping away, so I don't get caught up in some bullcrap. Got to get back to fixing your roof. All right. So, uh, here I go. About to fix your entire roof. - Mm, okay. - That's great, you're an angel. Blessed be, our hero. I'll take that, I guess. Hey, it's Violet. I'm gonna be a couple minutes late. I'll hurry. Okay! Sorry, it-it won't happen again. Who's she talking to on that phone? Kids don't talk to each other on the phone anymore. She's obviously talking to a grown man! Wayne! Wayne! We need you to build a peephole so we can spy on Vi. I'm up here fixing holes, not making them. - Oh, please? - Pretty please? No! Now y'all get down from here. Oh, uh-oh, I'm sliding, y'all! Will you two knock it off? Don't claw the shingles. Well, there goes five dollars. Ten. Let go of my ankle! Don't kick your mother, you monster. 15... $20. - Wayne, save us! - $85. We're gonna die! Will you two just slightly extend your legs? Wait, what the hell? Bobbie Nell, why are you filming us?! I'm just gathering evidence. All this roof racket is driving my free-range cockatiel bonkers. Bobbie Nell, that bird just wants to get out of your house. He's trapped in a bird nightmare. You're all nightmares! And I'm about to be your nightmare and your daymare. If Violet ever caught us snooping, she would never forgive us. Did you find anything? No, but we'd better find out soon before she ends up dead in a ditch. Good Lord, Mother. It's just an expression, Jenny. And expression that some poor mom came up with when she found her daughter dead in a ditch. - Oh, Lord! - We got to find out what the hell she's up to. Tomorrow we are gonna put a tail on her. See you in court, Wayne. What? You're gonna sue me for $4,999?! For me and my bird's emotional distress. See you this afternoon, turd lover. - What? - Turd lover. - It's a person who loves... - No! I mean the part where you said, "See you this afternoon"? Well, it'd be a shame if you couldn't make it. Then I would automatically win. Bobbie Nell, I swear to God. Oh, dang it, you spooked her! Something's off as hell. She's never walked this far in her life. That's it. I'm calling her. Hey, Violet. - Just calling to see what you're up to. - Yeah, well, I'm hanging over at David's. We're watching The Great British Bake Off. Got to go. Oh, God. She lied. She lied straight into my earholes. Go around, you monsters! Hey, my babies. I'm going faster than y'all are. Oh, no! A pebble! They got her out there recruiting. Who-who? Recruiting for what? I've been holding back because I didn't want to freak you out, but I am a hundred percent sure Violet's in a cult. He's isolating her from her family, demanding secrecy. ...Now, when we get to the cult place, do not let me get anywhere near the leader. We don't know how charming he is going to be. But I do know that when I get around one of those Svengalis, I'm gonna get immediately swept up into his orbit. What in the hell are you talking about? It's the power, Jenny. What can I tell you? Bhagwan. Yes. The Reverend Sun Myung Moon? Where do I sign? L. Ron Hubbard? Oh, in that Navy uniform? He can audit my bathing suit area anytime. Mother, that is a bummer. Well, I'm just saying don't judge this man until we see how handsome he is. - Uh-oh. - What? My diaper's full. Your what is what? I'm wearing a crazy astronaut lady diaper because I didn't know how long this was going to take. But they don't tell you how quick these things fill up. I feel like I got a bowling ball down there. Mother, are you insane? No. Putting on this crazy astronaut lady diaper is the sanest thing I've ever done. I would do anything for my grandbaby. And if you cared about Violet, you'd be wearing a diaper, too. Pulling over. Got to dump it and slam on a fresh one. Your Honor, Ben Matlock, attorney-at-law. Ooh, boy. Let me put my chili dog down. "Ooh, boy. Let me put my chili dog down." What's up, weirdo? Hey, Brenda. Got to go to court today. - Court? - Bobbie Nell's suing me. Oh, crap. You're gonna lose. I can't afford to lose. She's suing me for five grand. That is a life-ruining amount of money. Boy, are you glad I ran into you, Wayne, 'cause I am the queen of Guilford County small-claims court. Slip and falls, Craigslist mishaps, waterslide burns... The list goes on and on. I'm-a go with you. Oh, thanks, Brenda, but I'm gonna be fine. I'm studying old Matlocks. Lame. Bobbie Nell is an animal in that courtroom. It's how she makes her living. You're gonna need more than just your moseying Southern lawyer show. You're gonna need me. Let's tank up! Dickie, we'll have a round of peach cobbler Slusheritos and an order of flour gravy poppers. Oh, snap. You going to court? Come on, Mother! We're losing her. Violet, no! Be careful on that giant, stupid bike! I will for the sake of me and our baby, Randy Jr. Next stop Jacksonville, my babies. Oh, no, a bottle cap! Drive, drive, drive! What the hell are we running from?! The clerk saw me pushing my diaper into that straw wrapper trash can by the soda fountain. Now, where the hell is Violet? Well, I was watching her walk towards the Birchwood Strip Mall, but now I'm snoot first in a crevasse. Oh, Lord! We are wedged in this ditch. Don't worry. I got this. Mama bear energy! You can't just summon it, Jenny. Here, let me try. Ow! Looks like we're gonna have to squish and shimmy. Oh, my dipe. Well, on the bright side, I can't speak for all the other ditches, but at least we know Violet's not dead in this one. ...Now there's only one thing left to do. - Hitchhiking? - If we are gonna save her, we've gotta follow her down the rabbit hole. Yep. Still got the thumb of a 16-year-old. Hey, sugar. Ooh, look at that big wheel! We're trying to catch up with my daughter, so if you could just - drop us off at the Birchwood Strip Mall? - Sure. Wait. This isn't a sting, is it? One of those To Catch a Predators? Just kidding. Let's go grab that little girl. Oop. Got to make a pit stop. Open the door. We can jump out. - Now's our chance. - Well, it's happening. I'm finally being human trafficked. I guess on the bright side, they will be getting me - in my prime. - What in the hell is wrong with you? Sir? Mister? Sir? - He's doing drugs! - Oh, it's heron! Oh! No, it's just my insulin. We're coming, Violet! Let us borrow those bikes, children. - Give us those bikes! - We need those bikes! Get on the bikes! I've been following your wins. Follow yours, too. You won a settlement for slipping on a Slip 'N Slide, and "slip" is right there in the title. Kudos, milady. I've heard of a hot coffee lawsuit, but an iced coffee lawsuit? Impressive. This is gonna be fun. So, do we just walk on in? 'Cause on Matlock, they just come back from commercial, and everybody's already in there. Reverse mortgage, home catheter delivery, cash for gold, and then, boom... Matlock's in the courtroom ready to poke holes in alibis and timelines. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. We are not doing any of that Matlock crap. Brenda, you better be right, because I'm worried as hell. I can't lose this case and have a hole in the roof. Last I saw her, she was walking toward this strip mall! Oh, my God. You were right, Mother. She's in a cult. Well... it's showtime. Why in the hell are you so horned up over all this? All rise for the Honorable Judge Debbie Donatello. - Oh, no... - Oh, not the Yankee judge. Hi. I'm Judge Debbie Donatello. I ran the toughest courtroom in New York City. Murders, beheadings, subway shovings, Mob, bodega-on-bodega arsons, all that stuff. I moved down here to beautiful North Carolina to get out of that hellhole. All right, what's first on the docket? Your Honor, this man gave my cockatiel a psychotic break, which caused me property damage and emotional... distress. Damn. She got to the emotion card first. Well, it's a good thing Mr. Ben Matlock, Esquire, brought his secret weapon: the Farmer's Almanac. I'm about to prove that full moon's - been causing that bird's upset. - Don't be an idiot! Ow! We're not doing that hokey folksy Matlock crap. Now, you go on and hush and watch me overwhelm them with facts and figures. In these 50-some-odd United States of America, there are upwards of 62 billion roofs. This does not include Puerto Rico and Guam. Let's get into why. This makes sense. Look around. This cult targets nerds! It's a voice mail from Violet. Shh. Hi, Mom. I'm not gonna be hoe for dinner. - I have some stuff... - Violet, I told you no phone calls. - Bring the baby over here. - Oh, Lord. There is an older man. An older, controlling man. And a baby! Where is she? Where is Violet Hart? Oh, Violet? Yeah, she's next door. No! Hey! Don't go in there! He doesn't like it when people let the light in! Oh, my Lord. There he is. The cult leader. - Oh. - What? I thought we would do better with the face. Did you know that there are more Spanish roof tiles than there are stars in the galaxy? All right, all right, your time's up. It's so cute you people think these are problems. Other lady, go. I'd like to call my star witness. Anita, come! As you can see, she is a sweet, normal bird. Oh, yeah, that is a beautiful bird! I'm used to diseased subway pigeons fighting a rat over a slice. But watch what this nail gun does to her. ...No! - Anita! - No! -Judge Debbie! - What the hell is this? Don't let that country-ass bird land on me! Oh! All right, relax, people. A bird flew into a fan. You know, I once saw a mobster shove a cabbie's manhood into a Vitamix. Now, that's called a Mulberry Street Smoothie. All right, let's take a recess. I can't see what's going on. It's a baby! And she's wearing a wedding dress! The leader is marrying the baby! Oh, God, Violet's sister wife is a baby! Prop her up. I want to see that beautiful little face. After all, today is the day she dedicates herself to God. We have to stop them! I'll grab the baby bride, you grab Violet, and we'll book it out of here. Okay. - Three, two... - There's no time! Mama bear energy...! Ow! That baby is not marrying anyone today! Mom! Gram! What the hell? - What are you doing? - What are you doing? We're taking photos of this baby on her christening day. This is my part-time job, you lunatics. - Oh... - And that's why - he said... oh... - The white dress is... - Oh, and you're not in a cult. - And I'm not attracted to him - because... oh... - You're just... oh... Thought she was getting married. If only you would have told me... Yeah, I should have told you, so you could come in here and mortally embarrass me sooner. Got it. Just please get out. Vi! Just go. Maybe y'all could use this in one of your little fall tableaus. Hey, friend. What's gotcha down? All I wanted to do was put a roof over my family's head, and now it's about to cost me five grand. Son, if I may offer some advice: it ain't over till the gavel hits the pine. Oh, sir, you are so right! Well, got to get to my murder trial. Wish me luck. - Rest your case, or you're going to sleep. - You rest your case, or you're going to sleep. If I may, Your Honor. Whew, boy! I sure am glad Lady Justice wears a blindfold, so she didn't have to see this devil's circus that went on in here today. Look at us. I plumb forgot what this dustup's even about. Now, what I'm-what I'm... what I'm trying to say here is, hoo, boy, we all need to stop fightin'. And if something's worrying our warts, we got to open our mouths and communicate. We all need to stop fighting and start being kinder and-and more neighborly, 'cause hot diggity dog, and I do mean shucks. Hoo, boy! Wayne, you're right. I guess I should start being kindlier. Bobbie Nell, I'm so sorry for whatever part I had in what happened to Anita. But the good news is, now she's in Heaven, flying into that big ol' sliding glass door in the sky. Don't worry, Wayne, she was terminal anyway. Riddled with tumors. She slept on my cell phone every night. I couldn't stop her. Brenda and Bobbie Nell, bring it in here. Aw. This hokey, small-town crap is beautiful. If this was New York, the floor would be covered in number twos. Case dismissed. No, thank you. Can you just tell me why you wanted to get a secret job? I share everything with you guys. My bedroom is also our family storage unit and laundry room. I really just wanted something that was just mine. I totally get that, Vi. And I'm so sorry I embarrassed you. Okay. Are we done? You know, when I was young I made a lot of mistakes. And the fact that I survived those years was pure luck. I just got scared that you wouldn't be as lucky, and I went a little crazy. I know I need to trust you. I mean, we both know you're smarter than I was. I just need to remember that. 90-Day Beyoncé is coming on. You want to watch it with me? I'm sorry, Megan, but we're at day 32, and you barely look like Beyoncé. It's time for you to leave the Beyhive. The exit is... to the left. Hello, turd lovers. Bobbie Nell, what happened to you? Well, you hugged me too hard after court! You just bought yourself a lawsuit. Oh, I just remembered, your hug ripped my rotator cuff. Ow! Countersuit! - Oh, Lord. - Bunch of loonies. Ma'am? What the hell are you doing? Haven't you ever seen a grown woman put an adult diaper in the straw trash before? No, ma'am, I have not. And I think that violates every health code that has ever been written down. Well, you should empty the trash in the ladies' restroom. This is on you! Oh, come on! And pick up all these sunglasses! Every damn spectacle...
