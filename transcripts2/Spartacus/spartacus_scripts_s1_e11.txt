   It is never an easy thing to see a friend once loved now absent breath. He should yet walk. That foolish grin, and dreams of a life beyond these walls. Every night breaks. And we must all wake. I would the gods turn back the sun... And set me in his place. He fought with honor. As did you both. His art was stilled for a boy's amusement. Where is the honor in that? Varro left this world a gladiator. And shall be remembered as such. No. He will be remembered as a husband. A father. And a friend amongst enemies. Aurelia... Is it true? That he perished by your sword? He loved you as a brother. He's not going to take this loss well. And who can fucking blame him? Calavius slaughters my stock at the whim of his maggot, shits upon my ambitions, mocking me in my own house. No, not a loss to be taken fucking well. But one that will be answered in kind. Out. He is a magistrate. To move against him... He is but a man. And all men fall, beneath the heel of their hubris. Quintus.. Turn thoughts toward other matters. What of Ilithyia? Does she move to secure us her husband's patronage? The support of a Legatus should be more than enough to gain political office. I only regret Calavius will not live to see the "unworthy" name of Batiatus so elevated. The very thought of discovery... It turns the stomach. Make it a thing of iron, and see it settled. What news? Speak, caress my ear with words. You will find them soft and pleasing. We set upon the magistrate on the road leaving the city. The guards and wagon? Attended to as instructed. The man himself removed to the appointed place. Ashur? Standing watch. I will relieve him by cover of night. I shall accompany. I would gaze into the man's eyes, and see the power of my reflection in them. Until such time, avail yourself of my hospitality. Wine, women... Both would suit me. And so deserved. Dominus. It's done, then? No. It's only just begun. Behold, the glorious Champion of Capua. A heavy heart weighs a man's sword. The loss of a brother is heartfelt by every gladiator. We honor him not with tears, but with blood spilled in the arena. Spoken as a true champion. The games against Pompeii approach. Years I have been robbed of the Primus by Solonius and his bribes. Finally it is secured by our Dominus, and who fights? Spartacus. The woman who Grieves. Spartacus. You are summoned. Is this truly my likeness? Have so many years passed, that marble must be etched with such lines? Would that every man lived to see his face so marred. And the wretched pass smooth of skin. Varro's death has been foremost in my thoughts. It seizes the breast to lose a gladiator of such standing. The comparison is false, to a son losing his father. A wife, her husband. A burden, to be sure. Yet he was aware of risk and took them of his free will. As a gladiator. Not a child's plaything. The magistrate and his whelp have caused us both pain. It will not go unanswered, I promise you. I would be of service towards the deed. Take comfort from knowing its intent. I would have your focus turned towards the games of Pompeii. That perfumed shit Solonius always secured the Primus by inserting tongue in ass, only to be crushed by our city's hated rival. But this year he falls out of favor. This year the House of Batiatus secures the honor! Spartacus, bringer of rain, to face Pericles, titan of Pompeii! It is to be sine missione? No quarter given, no mercy shown. And the purse? To be on a footing with the match itself. I would see it paid to Varro's wife. A substantial sum. You would see it all past from your fingers? Along with future winnings that I claim in the arena. A noble gesture. One I shall see matched. You would do this? For Varro? I would do it for you, Spartacus. That you have peace of mind, knowing his family is attended to. These sad events have obviously taken their toll. Rest, and be reassured that those responsible for our pain will soon drink deep of their own. It is regretful, what happened to Varro. I saw in your eyes how you craved to defy order of his death. A shame you did not attempt it. Goat-fuck! I knew it! Why do you fucking bleat? You fight by my side, brother! Like a suckling babe. I would prove myself alone. And die the same. Our champion does not look to form. Hm, the gods punish him. For what offense? You fucking jest. Varro's blood, still wet upon his hands? His hands were removed from choice. I would die before I would kill my own brother.. And who would see to your brother's family? What answer do you give, Duro? With both of you dead, who would see to his wife?! His child?! My brother has no wife or child. Wait! Fucking thracians. Apologies. I called your name... I did not hear. You do not appear yourself. Did Dominus send you? He would see your spirits raised. They do not deserve it. Spartacus.. Your wound... It's a scratch. Varro suffered worse. I will help you to your cell. You are not needed. Apologies. Mira. The man I saw you with... I was ordered to tend to his needs. He means nothing to me. Such is not my concern. The man was wounded trying to protect my wife. Next you lay with him, I would have you offer my gratitude. Batiatus... Apologies for the accommodation, magistrate. Take comfort knowing that you will not have to endure for long. What is this madness? Madness? No. It's only reason, born of a clear mind and wounded heart. Wounded? I have done you no injury. The man's crimes escape his lofty notice. Release me! Oh, I intend to. From this fucking world. Whatever your disagreement, let us discuss it as civilized men. No, you mistake me. I am but a base animal. A beast to be ridden and disregarded. Batiatus.. You accept my hospitality. Enter my home. Break bread, drink my wine. Only to spit in my face. "Leave politics to the men who have the breeding for it." Offense was not my intent. I sought only to spare you further humiliation... Spare me?! You don't have power to spare shit, you pathetic cunt! Uh! Now speak the words! Tell me my heritage! Tell me my family name bears no weight among you and your noble cock eaters! Huh? Speak! Apologies, Dominus. Perhaps if you move your foot... Lift him up. Dominus. You wish words from me? May you listen to them well. You are a jest. A man tolerated, because of his ownership of Spartacus, the savior of Capua. When he falls, you will quickly follow. Tied to a fucking chair in the filth and mire, and yet the man provokes! You still do not see it, do you, good Batiatus? You are beneath me. And you always will be, in this life or the next. Do what you must to balm your wounded pride. I will not beg. Beg? No, the time for begging is long past. Plans have been set in motion. For you... And young Numerius. What does my boy to do with it? He is a man now. He too has a part to play in our little drama. Batiatus, you.. Attend he does not injure himself. I would see him fresh for the appointed time. Is this wise, Dominus? Perhaps if we err.. Argh! Take hold of your cock and follow the plan, uh. We are committed, we are committed. Dominus. The games approach! Prove yourselves against Pompeii, and honor the House of Batiatus! My brother meant nothing by his remarks. He spoke his mind. Thoughts shared by many. You wish to rest? If I do, I shall tell you. Did I hurt you... Champion? Tend to the wound. Spartacus! Spartacus... The man is half dead! You didn't notice he needed fucking attention?! I thought him only distracted by Varro's death. Will he be able to fight against Pompeii? He burns with fever. A miracle if he lives to the games. Provide a list of all that is needed. Ashur heads to market, he will see it filled. Let not a moment pass with him unattended. Fetch Mira from the villa if you need assistance. He has some feelings towards the girl. Her touch may aid recovery. Our champion cannot fall. Dominus. The Primus against Pompeii finally mine and the gods jam cock in ass! The crowd will turn upon me when they learn Spartacus does not fight! Perhaps they will be appeased with suitable replacement. Who but Spartacus could best their fucking champion? There is but one... The Primus? Mine! At last Batiatus remembers my worth and I shall take the sand again. And see it turn red with the blood of Pericles! Soften your words. We will be discovered. Will let them hear us. Tonight, I am a god! And I will reclaim my title, Champion of Capua... The news does not please you. It fills my heart with joy, to see you so alive. And would have you remain so. Naevia... The Primus is a fight to the death, Crixus. You have been absent the arena many months. If Pericles were... Shh. He will not. How can you be certain? Because I will never leave your side. Death will tremble if it tries to part us. Tomorrow when I take victory, I will look to you in the pulvinus. We will share the moment alone. Your hand is weighted. Now float your tongue. You are safe. My master has greater concerns requiring his attentions. What plagues good Batiatus to such distraction? Matters beyond your worries. Yet they clearly trouble you. Confide, lift your burden. He has grown reckless. His thirst for power and vengeance clouds judgment. How so? I have taken too great a risk meeting with you this night. I must to the apothecary, before I am overdue. One day, very soon, the House of Batiatus will come crashing down. Do not find yourself buried in the rubble. Fucking hold him down! That's right. Easy. Well, lick my hole. The pig-fucker's still alive. This is what you are to him. Gold, mined from blood and meat. All hail Spartacus. Slayer of the shadow. Bringer of the rain. Champion of the romans... Die! Fuck! Is that the best the great Pompeii has to offer? I fear the games will be a disappointment this year. These early skirmishes count for nothing. It is the Primus that decides the Victor. Um hum. Absent your man Spartacus, Capua shall once again find itself in Pompeii's shadow. Perhaps Crixus will bring light to the matter. Crixus, yes. The crowd will be amazed... That the gaul is still alive. Batiatus assures us he's recovered from his injuries. That he survived at all is impressive. No gladiator from Pompeii ever lived against Theokoles. Young Numerius cuts to the truth. A talent he learned from his father. Does good Calavius intend to grace us with his presence? The day grows short. Critical matters of trade in Picentia. He must have been delayed upon his return. I am certain he will join us presently. Aulus! Up, you fucking goat! Dominus does not pay you to dream of tits and cunts. Place foot on me again, and find yourself once more a cripple. You know the stakes we deal. If Calavius were to escape... Fuck your mouth shut. The man has not stirred. Nor does he breathe! Batiatus commanded he not expire until the appointed hour! He's still alive, you fucking woman. Raise yourself, peacock! Shit... This is on you. I will share no... Quiet! He breathes. The man is still alive. Aulus! I will have you both crucified! And your master.. Aulus, enough! Aulus! Let me see. Let me see. Ugly as a whore's gash, but you will live. Return to the ludus and have Medicus attend to it. Do you have the balls to see this through alone? Two of them. Very large. Go. We wait an eternity. Why don't I begin our Primus? The crowd threatens riot. We can await Calavius no longer. Good Batiatus. Would you present the Primus on my husband's behalf? Well, if you think it proper... Please. Boo! Where's the fucking magistrate! We want some action! Capua! In honor of magistrate Calavius, who is absent attending vital business on your behalf, I present the Primus against Pompeii! Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus! Yes! Yes, we all desire to see Spartacus, take to the sands! But sadly this day shall not see him with sword in hand! Yet there is cause to rejoice! This is a glorious moment, much anticipated! For it marks the return to the arena of one of Capua's favored sons... Crixus! Murmillo! They have forgotten the honor that I have brought them. Then it is time you reminded them who their true champion is. It appears Capua does not care for your selection. He faces a most vile opponent, belched from the bowels of Pompeii. Hum! I give you Pericles! Thraex! Pericles! I pray the match is overly brief! Hm! I would see his fat smirk removed. Give the command. Begin! Oh! What was the fucking cause? A dog, soon to be put down. Drink. Smells like piss. Henbane. It's to make you rest. I need food and a few hours sleep. Come for me if his condition changes. Pompeii! Another year, another "favored son" of Capua gone to grass. The match is not yet concluded. Formalities of blood. Your man is finished. Crixus has the heart of a lion. Look! He yet rises... Oh! Lucretia! Domina. Give her water. Your wife does not fare well at the sight of your man about to be slaughtered. Apologies. Its the heat... See her back to the villa. It will pass. No arguments. I will join you afterwards. Dominus. Crixus! Kill! Kill! Kill! Crixus! Crixus! Crixus! Crixus! Crixus! Returned to form as promised! Your prayers have been answered. The match was overly brief. Good fortune to Capua, and all its deserving citizens. Oh, linger a moment! Let us have a drink and relive this glorious day... Dominus... What news so important it interrupts the gloating of good Batiatus? The magistrate's caravan has been discovered on the edge of town. His guards murdered. What of my father? He was not among them, but there are tracks, leading back to the city. Back to Capua? Why would anyone commit such treachery? Ransom. This burden saddens me. If I may be of any assistance... Gratitude. We can handle it. I will gather my men to aid in the search. Numerius, your presence is welcome. No. I will have him by my side. Mother. I will never let him out of my sight. You have my oath on it. Ok. Come. Let us to your father. You send message, yet I wait as a common slave. Apologies. It was difficult to move without notice. The alarm is up across the city. Speak quickly. I join the search for good Calavius. He's gone missing. I am aware of his absence. The very matter I wish to broach. Calavius' ring! Shhh! Softly! Softly! How did you come by this? Through means pressing upon your desires. Batiatus holds him captive, with intent of murder. Madness, even for Batiatus. Magistrate Calavius insults him, obstructs his ambitions. I've never seen Batiatus so unhinged. I would sever bonds, least I find myself upon the cross beside him. Calavius. Yet lives? For the briefest of moments. Where is he held? Oh, you speak of severing bonds, but remain firmly tethered! I hold no love for old loyalties, yet Calavius has seen my face! I must flee this city, and would have proper means to do so. Take it. And more, when Batiatus and his treachery are laid to rest. Come, we must gather men. Calavius would be dead before you do. Batiatus already moves towards his plan. Are you armed? A simple dagger... Enough to cut ropes. Quickly! Or see opportunity fade! Medicus? Mira? Why did you kill him? I had no choice. A man must accept his fate... Or be destroyed by it. Is this my path? Blood and death? You have always been destined for unfortunate things... Please... Do not leave me again... It was you... It was you, who left... You must tend to the wound. Attacked... On the road... Came out of nowhere. Tend to the wound. I'm here. I'm here. Be still... Your fevers broken. The gods have blessed you... Yes. They have. I will fetch Medicus. Wait. Release the straps. I would speak to this man, alone. Towards what purpose? Wait in the corridor. Sound warning if anyone approaches. Do this for me, Mira. I will be in your debt. There is no sign of him. My father could be held anywhere. He is a man of much esteem, and easily recognized. How could he be moved through the streets without notice? I do not know. Think. There must be a way... The cisterns! They run beneath the city and beyond! The gates! Torches! You will be with your father, soon enough Numerius. You have my word. Your part in this shall not be forgotten. No, it shall not. Calavius... Wait. They approach! We must hurry. No, it is too late. Steel your fucking nerve! I will not end murder by you or any man! Consider Ashur a spirit, and Capua the world he left behind! Ashur! They are upon us! We must get you free... Solonius! No, no... Seize him! Your father shall be avenged. Solonius will suffer for what he has done. And all of Capua will know you for the shit you are. What are you doing?! What are you doing?! Tell me what happened. Tell! Take your hands off me. My wife. Sura. The slave you were transporting from Neapolis. Tell me what happened to her. We were attacked, on the road. They tried to get to her, but argh... Where is your wound? Where is the wound you earned trying to save my wife? Guard... Tell me, tell me! I only did... As commanded... Who spoke the words that took her life? Who?! Bat.. ia.. tus... What have you done? Help me restore him. You will secure my straps... And never speak of this. The wound did not appear fatal. The damage was deeper than the eye could perceive. Medicus tells he drowned in his own blood. Oh. A loose end. No longer needing to be tied. Hm. You have played your part well, Ashur. Was greater hand than mine that conceived it. Solonius was easily deceived into believing you would betray me. As I knew he would. He never suspected my loyalty always lay with you. A man who has no honor cannot imagine that trait in anyone else, and you, you have that quality above all others. And shall be rewarded in kind. Your will, Dominus. Oh, oh. The gods truly favor the House of Batiatus! Behold! Spartacus risen from the dead! Spartacus! You are well? Yes, Dominus. I am myself again.
