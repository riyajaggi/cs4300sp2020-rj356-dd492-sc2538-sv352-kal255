 I'm jackie wackerman. My mom's job got transferred to mellowbrook, Which i thought was gonna be totally lame, but then i saw you, And i figure you must be, like, a really famous daredevil! Can i have your autograph? Uh, where do i sign? [jackie gasping] And i was wondering If i could just touch your helmet. I will never wash this finger again. [laughing] you're awesome! I am so your biggest fan in the world now, And i'm totally starting your fan club. We'll have t-shirts and membership cards and buttons... Sorry, miss. This is one daredevil Who is not in it for the fame. But every great american hero has a fan club. Billy stubbs, rock callahan, boom mccondor. I'm in all their clubs. Hey, you got wax in your ears? I said... Well, if those guys have fan clubs... I'll get started right away. [laughing] um, what's your name again? The name's kick. Kick buttowski. Kick buttowski fan club! Touch. [screams] Did you hear that, gunther? I've got a biggest fan. You can do it, kick! Do it. Goodbye, my chocolate friends. You're done, son. Perfect. Let's do this. Holla! [camera shutter clicking] You're killing this one. What? What? That was awesome! And delicious. [laughing] [laughing] Hey, buddy, what was my time? Whoo-hoo! 8.06 seconds. That's a new record. Well, let's try it again and see if we can... no time for that. Gotta show you your new web page. A web page? Well, maybe later. Come on! That's okay. I'll just, uh, Get down by myself. [screeching] Hey, kick, i saved you a seat, And i brought you our favorite... Chewy bran chunks with a chia chug chaser. Part of a nutritious breakfast. Slide it on over, pal. [jackie] no! As president of your fan club, I present you With these! Hey, sweet. I think it really captures your inner awesome. I never knew how great it was to have fans. "I never knew how great it was to have fans." Kick, over here! Hey, kick, i got your favorite lunch... A sardine peanut butter and marshmallow sandwich, just like you like it. You can sit next to me if you want. I don't need to eat because watching you eat is enough for me. [sighing] [jackie] that's $5. Thank you. Now, as full-fledged members of the kick buttowski fan club, You'll be entitled to discounts on many premium souvenirs, Such as the autographed jumbo bandage pack Containing actual bandages worn by kick After his death-defying stunts. I'll take one. How much for the smelly sock? Psst! Kick, i did a little reconnaissance. You're not gonna believe what i reconnoitered. Aw, come on, gunther. I'm serious. Just look at me. Serious? So serious. Okay, fine. Come on. But we gotta go stealth mode. Attention, neighbors. Do you realize we live next to a world-famous stuntman? [kick] and exactly why Are we climbing into jackie's bedroom? You'll see. Behold the wacky. [kick] i thought i lost those. Starting to get the picture yet? Yeah, i am. This room... It's so... Fantastic! Oh, for the love of... ahh! Oh, yeah? Well, check this out. I'm kick buttowski. I love you, jackie. [laughing] She's my number 1 fan for sure. [squeaks] ooh, cupcakes! Gimme. When are you gonna realize that jackie is wacky? Why is she so wacky? Because she started a fan club for me? Because she rifles through my trash? Because she makes great cupcakes? Yeah. Don't you see? She's obsessed with you. You better get rid of your fan before it's too late. You know, i'm beginning to wonder if you're a fan. You're right, kick. I'm not your fan. [sniffles] i'm your friend. Buddy, come on. Aw, see? I knew you'd come around. [bell rings] Dude, i got the principal To let me move into the locker next to yours. Then i knocked out the wall in between So we can be roomies. [bell dings] And look. I made cookies. Only they're kickies. Come on. There's milk in the fridge. Hi, kick. [chuckles] [whirring] Ta-da! Oopsie. [chuckling] [toilet flushes] [horn blares] Nice work, dude. That's a new record. Let me wash your hands for you. Aw, finally, peace. And opportunity. [growling] [barking] Say cheese! [barking] [panting] maybe gunther's right. Maybe jackie is wacky. I'm not wacky, kid. I'm just your biggest fan. I'll never leave you. I love you. [horn honking] Hi, kick. We're your biggest fan. Oh, sorry, mr. Vickle. I didn't see you. Oh, no problem, kick. I'm your number 1 fan! Nooo! Whew! [chuckles] it was just a dream. Do you know you purr when you sleep? What are you doing in my bed? Pillow fight! [laughing] Fight back. It's funny. [doorbell rings] A present? Yay! Oh. Gunther, you gotta help me. Why don't you ask your fan for help? Gunther, wait. She's following me everywhere. She's ruining my stunts. I can't even go... [quietly] to the bathroom. It's awfully late to go knocking On people's doors, clarence. Especially people who aren't your friend. You were right about jackie. And you're what? Gunther, i'm sorry. Apology accepted. But what are we gonna do? I've got just the idea. [bell rings] Hey, kick, guess what. Hey, slow down, buddy. [whistle blowing] You're walking too fast. You know, gunther, Doing after-school safety patrol Is about the funnest thing in the world. Oh, hi, jackie. I heard a water main broke downtown. The entire sewer system is filled with rushing water, And i just happen to have a surfboard at home. Really? [chuckles] uh, no, thanks. I'd rather stay right here and brush up For my hall monitor exam. Study? Safety? I thought you were a daredevil. [laughs] him? A daredevil? Ha! He's a scaredy-cat, A wimp, a teeny, tiny, little... Ow! But you're a rebel! A hero! Oh, that stuff. I was just messing with you. I'm all about safety. Come on. Why do you think i wear this helmet all the time? For stunts. That's what you love. No. My true loves are safety, prevention, and caution. I hope to be a crossing guard someday. Ah. Isn't she beautiful? Watch out, kick. You almost stepped on a crack. Good call, buddy. Oh. I see. I guess i was mistaken about you. Remember, safety first. Look both ways when you're crossing the street. Yes! I'm free! We did it! Come on, gunther. Let's go surf that busted water main. [chomp] Okay, oscar. [growling] You can come, too. [laughing] [kick] come on, gunther. The gully only floods once a year, And i want to take advantage of it. Let's rock this thing. You're gonna need to go faster than that. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Okay. We're trucking now. Come on, gunther. Row, row, row your boat! Now, that's more like it. Uh, i'll just keep up the good work then. Did you see that? See that? I lived that. What was that thing? I didn't think she was real. What are you talking about? I'm talking about pescado del diablo. [thunderclap] Pescado del diablo? According to legend, She was thought to be dead... [toilet flushes] Flushed out to sea. Free from the constraints of her little glass bowl, She grew and grew Until she reached the height of two battle snax. And now, every year When the gully floods, she returns To seek revenge on anyone Who dares trespass on her turf. We need to catch that fish. I knew you were gonna say that. We'll harness its power For the most extreme wakeboarding ever! But i can't row fast enough to catch pescado del diablo. I have weak arms. Well, first, we're gonna need a bigger boat. [horn blaring] Well, that was unexpected. Ahoy there, mateys! What are you two doing in the middle of the flooded gully? The legend says that she's more fearsome Than any shark, bigger than any whale... Stop. You had me at "the." I was going to sail to south beach, but forming a posse To chase down a deadly, man-eating sea creature Is right up my alley. Okay. But be warned. We may not make it back alive. Not make it back alive? You mean, i could miss dinner? Pa-lease. Three men alone on the open water. What could possibly go wrong? [thunderclap] [thunderclap continues] [both yelling] The food! Help! [grunting] Help! Help! Help! I've got it under control. Go. Right. [yelling] [rope creaking] Can't hold on! Gotcha. Hang on, everyone. Gunther. Gunther! Wake up, gunther. [coughing] Am... am i dead? Oh, gunther, I'm sorry i brought you into this crazy mess. What are we doing out here, anyway? Maybe it was just me. Maybe i just wanted it to be real. I bet pescado del diablo was just a figment Of our imagination. [screams] my leg! Whew. [screams] my shoe! A shoe is a small price to pay For the most extreme wakeboarding ever! But i liked that shoe. I called him lefty. She's even bigger than they say. No. It must've been something else. I'm a goldfish aficionado. They don't get that big. Give anything enough time and enough food, it'll grow. Remember that. Impossible. [hits table] Then how do you explain... This? Looks like fish teeth tore these pants, doesn't it? Goldfish teeth. Look at it! Look! Goldfish don't have teeth. Tell that to my leg! Goldfish don't have teeth. [both laughing] You're okay, old man. You, too, kid. You, too. [sonar beeping] She's here. [beeping intensifies] She's everywhere! I don't want to get eaten by a giant goldfish! No one's getting eaten by a giant goldfish. [rumbling] My chance. I got her. You got her? No! She's got us! She's got us! [engine revving] I'm full throttle. She's too strong. She's gonna take us down. Cut the line! Cut the line! You heard him. Cut the line! Not till i've had my ride. [rope creaking] Save yourself. No! I won't let you die! Who said anything about dying? My board! [screams] there! Two points off the starboard! Go! Go! Go! Excellent. I was hoping for a boat chase. [grunting] Now let's see what this baby can do. Let's go! Hang on, kick! Whoo-hoo! [muffled yelling] [yelling] [gunther] hang on, kick! We'll circle around to get you! Faster! Faster! She's coming back for us! Hang on, boys. Nice driving. Never mess with a navy man. Now that you got your ride, can we just get out of here? I rocked my goal! So yes. Good. Let's get outta here! Aye, aye, matey. [engine grinds] [stops] uh-oh. We're out of fuel. How cliché. [clanging softly] It sure is quiet. Too quiet. [clanging continues] Look who returned to rumble. Okay, let's rumble, fish. Brace yourselves! Kick! Kick? I got her! [roars] [growling] Stop, you fool! She'll eat you where you stand! [roars] Uh, goldie? [crying] Goodbye, goldie. I'll miss you. [toilet flushing] Oh, goldie. It is you. So... [cries] so sweet. Goldie, we're gonna need a lift. Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo! [gunther] lefty!
