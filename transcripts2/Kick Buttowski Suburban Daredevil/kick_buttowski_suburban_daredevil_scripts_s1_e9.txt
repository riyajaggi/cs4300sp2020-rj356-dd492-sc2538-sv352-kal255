 Have a nice trip, dill weed. [whistling] I don't know why, But brad has really been unstoppable lately. I need to step up my game. You'd need to be like a super-ripped pro wrestler to beat brad. Too bad there's no wrestling academies in mellowbrook. Sorry, boys. No time to talk. Gotta get back to wrestling academy. [growling] [blows landing] Oh, it's hopeless. You'll never beat brad. Come on. So where do we sign up? [laughing] Hi-eeh! What do you want? I need you to teach me how to wrestle So i can give my older brother a beat down. Younger brothers are no match for older brothers. No wasting my time. [blow lands] [gunther] wait for me, kick. [cries] Get ready for round two. He's right, kick. We're too small to stand against the big guys, And, you know, it's not so bad living a life of fear, Like my pet guinea pig. [whimpers] Good night, my love. [screams] Why is he always so scared? Come on. Let's go practice darting our eyes around in fear. Gunther. Um, huh? Look at this. [reads] That's more my style. [reads] [belches] Papercut peterson at your service. You're going to teach me to wrestle. My older brother keeps beating me up. I've got to beat him back. Older brother? I hate older brothers. All right, i'll teach you. Great. Let's get cracking. Get ready, gunther. It's time for a training montage. To the punching bag. To the treadmill. [huffing] It's too fast. It's... Too... Fast. Now you're ready for ring work. See, i'm in a sleeping bag to make it fair. Now, show me what you got. Uh... [papercut smacks] Not good enough! If you can't win with strength, Find another way. Work together. If you can't handle something, Tag out with your partner. Get each other's backs. [squealing] [screams] tag! [screams] [papercut] see, i trained him. [meows, purring] One, two, three, i'm out. Get ready, gunther. [growls] Oh, yes! Yes! Well, i've taught you everything i know, So i guess, uh, who wants ice cream? [gulps] uh, let me just pretend to have money. I got it. It's the least i could do. [screams] Paper is my only weakness. Don't you forget it. [groans] Papercut peterson? You named yourself after your weakness? I used to be piledriver peterson. [kick] that was you? You used to be awesome. I don't do that anymore, Not since my older brother beat me down, Forced me to quit. [grunting] Come on, work those thick triceps. Ah, so what do we have here? Beat it, sanchez. Why don't you mind your manners, muchacho? Maybe you should vamanos Because younger brothers Will always lose. [screams] frozen cream! What makes you think You can boss papercut around? I'm allowed to boss him around Because papercut is my younger brother. [gasps] papercut? It's true. Shogun sanchez is my older brother. That academy of his used to be mine Until he beat me down and took it from me, Kicked me out into the cold. See? I put a hat on 'cause it's cold. That's the end of my story. No, it isn't. Tonight we're going to prove That younger brothers can beat older brothers. You may be tough out here, But papercut can still beat you in the ring. And the prize is? Ownership of the wrestling academy. And if you lose? Oh, we won't lose. You're on, my little chihuahua. You can take this guy. [grunts, trills] [growls] I've never beaten my brother. Every underdog has his day. Just remember everything you taught me. Yeah, okay, kick. Okay. Let's go! [audience cheering] [gasping] Yeah! Wait! Wait! Wait! We should not be fighting like this. We are brothers, And i feel bad about constantly brutalizing you. Wait, where have i heard that line before? And i know i can't make it up to you, So, well, will you accept my apology? Wow, that's actually really nice. Come on, let's shake on it. No! It's a trap! [echoing] no! Aah! A paper cut! My only weakness, Just like i said earlier! Ow-ee. Younger brothers are no match for older brothers. That's... True. Tag me in, papercut. Finally, kick, i really believed him. You want to take his place at the buffet of pain? Be my guest. I'll just tag in my star student. [whistles] [gasps] I should've known. That's why brad's been unstoppable. I'm going to injure your face In my heart blender. [laughs] yeah. [audience cheering] Older brothers rule. It's over, kick. We're just not strong enough to beat them. No. Remember what you taught me? If you can't win with strength, Find another way. Gunther, old blue. See, papercut? Little brothers don't always lose. That's what i'm talking about. What's this now? Oh, no, i'm a stage prop! He's going to cheat again, And he's going to throw that little girl. Watch out, kick! [roars] What? [growls] I don't believe it. Piledriver peterson is back. [audience cheering] [cheering] Thanks for giving me my old life back, kick. Thanks for helping me prove That younger brothers can beat older brothers. And thanks for the training montage.
