 For... School. Time for what now? Yowza! The entire planet is covered in snow. Every school on earth is closed. Uh, except mellowbrook. Ooh, this weather is so bracing. It gets me primed for learning. That's why i had daddy call and demand to keep school open. [groans] kendall. [brad] okay, gang, buckle up. Next stop is mellowbrook elementary. And remember, everyone just sits still and stays safe. We must always keep safety first. Especially when we're going up a giant ramp. A ramp? Whoo-hoo! Whoo! [all screaming] [yelling] Okay, take it easy. [yelling] [brakes screeching] Ooh! Well, that was close. Again! [yelling] [teeth chattering] [beeps] Breaker, breaker. This here's brad hollard. Come in. Over. [static] radio's out. What are we going to do? Waah! Huh. No worries. I'll just call daddy, and he'll send for... [gasps] no signal? No phone? No radio? It's like we slid back in time... To 1996. It's the end of the world! [screaming] Okay, okay. Calm down, all of you. As class president, i am in charge. Our first and most important order of business Is assign blame. Who in the world would build a snow ramp In the middle of the street? Who hasn't? [sniffs] okay, i did it. But i'm going to do something about it. I'll lead us out of here. Because when kick buttowski says he's gonna save everyone on the bus, He darn well saves everyone on the bus. So who's with me? No one! As president of the snowy bus crash preparedness team, I'm trained for just such a situation. Protocol dictates we stay put until help arrives. Or until we freeze solid. Whichever comes first. Well, i'm president and chair of the awesome rescue people team, And i'm heading out with my team. Huh. Fine. Go ahead. We'll see how far you get. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine! Gunther, let's move. Kick, i'll wait for you no matter how long it takes! Uh, okay. [knuckles cracking] Gunther, we need something powerful to pull us out of this. We need a tow truck. We need...

The one on this map. [gunther] got it covered, kick. [whistling] Let's do this. [boy] they'll never make it. No one ever makes it. We're gonna starve. Not if i ration our food. Everybody, pass your lunches down to me. Where is all the food? [gulps] [belches] [grunting] [grunting continues] We made it. I'm so happy, i could just... [yodeling] [rumbling] ooh! Sorry.

Sweet banana victory. [man] and now, back to the world's most excruciating wipeouts, Where pain is entertaining because it's happening to somebody else. We interrupt this program for a breaking news bulletin. We now take you to the zoo, Where a chimp has escaped from his enclosure. My monkey... he was just gone. I didn't even notice. My monkey. How can someone not notice a chimp on the loose? Uh, i don't know, kick. But what i do know is Best chocolate-covered bananas ever! Even he likes them. [chittering] It's that chimp from the news. We need to take him back. But it's a monkey. Well, technically, it's a chimp. Anthropods without tails fall into the category of... But it's a monkey. Look at him.

[screams, yelling] [crash] [teeth chattering] [chittering] [all laughing] Dr. Awesome is going to be the best pet ever. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You aren't thinking of keeping dr. Awesome, are you? I never think, gunther, i do. But your folks said they'd ground you If you brought home any more strays. Remember? [panting] [yowling] [chittering] Remember? [chittering] Relax, gunther. I got this. All we gotta do is keep giving him bananas to keep him calm, And no one will even notice. Are you sure? Of course i am. Chimps are awesome. But how can we disguise him to sneak him into the house? [gunther] that steely gaze, That stance, that signature pose... I got nothing. [mother humming] Oh, dear! You're looking a skosh pudgy, mister. [chitters] Hmm. That's better.

[pac-man sounds] [screaming] Well, we did it together. Every chimp is back in their friendly and accommodating environment. Speaking of home, i'd hate to be there When you face the wrath of your family and neighbors For unleashing massive chimp mayhem upon all of mellowbrook. [gasps] you're right. I can't go back there. Where will i go? How will i live? Mmm. And the missing chimps are all mysteriously back in the zoo again. In a completely unrelated story, Two human boys have been mistaken for chimps At our local zoo. Interesting. [laughs] oh, who could ever Mistake a human for a chimp? Here's daddy's cup. Mwah.
