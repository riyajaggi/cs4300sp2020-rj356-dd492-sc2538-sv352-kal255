I'm sure you all recall his ice leap of doom. Ahh. And here we have a collection of his scabs from gravel run. Ahh. No touching the exhibits! And now we will proceed to the highlight of the tour. That's one awesome tricycle. [kick] that's not just any tricycle. This is the trike x5. Kick's first stunt trike. [all] sweet. Me and this bad boy go way back. We had a lot of firsts together.

Brianna. Get out of my room. All right, where's my... The trike x5. What have you done? You don't ride it anymore. This is a pro-grade stunt trike. Ribbons severely downgrade the aerodynamics. And are those sparkles? Permanent sparkles. So cute. [groans] Stunt trikes aren't cute. And another thing! Ooh. I ask my folks for a monster truck, And they give me a sister. Pull over. You know you're not allowed to go out by yourself. Brad's watching me. [man on tv] next up, tankini lumberjacks. Yes. Fun time's over, bree. Time to let go of the handlebar. Iron grip.

I totally admire you, brianna. You're always trying in the face of certain failure. Uh, stupid pageant. Who even comes to these things? [groans] Gunther! Here she comes. Now i just wait for the signal. Brianna, hold on a second. You've always been my favorite. I always thought you had that certain je ne sais quoi. Really?

No. Did you quit When you led me on a chase through town That caused me abrasions, contusions, And a humiliating make-over? No! Then you're not going to quit now. You've got brains, talent, and the trike x5. And now ladies and gentlemen, Miss brianna g. Buttowski. And her musical wheels of doom. [audience gasps] I'm not sure i can do this, kick. You're the stunt guy. You've got that iron grip. Just hang on tight. That's how you hook them, bree. Ugh. Now, brakes in 3, 2... [cheering and applause] Yeah! Thanks, kick, so much. You were right. Trike x5 is the greatest. Yes, it is, and it's yours. Really? Really. Trike x5 victory lap. Whoo. Ride it bravely, brianna. Ride it wisely. [crash] ouch! And watch out for walls.
