 There's no escape, no food, No offerings for death when he comes for us. Aren't those vultures? Hold me, kick. I'm cold. This is it, gunther. This is what we've been looking for. It is? And with a little work, It'll be the ultimate hangout. You were right, kick. It's awesome. We got a wall of fame. A workout room that i will never use. An entertainment center. It's pretty much the greatest hangout spot on earth. Still missing one thing. Are you sure this is the best way to do this? Oh, yeah. [gunther howls] [howling continues] [howling continues] Blaah. Hey, look! It's the dillweed brothers' delivery service. Thanks for the housewarming present, losers. Yeah! Get your shoes off of our couch! This is our couch. Oh, yeah? [snap] That's our hangout. Not anymore. This is our place now. And i don't like the way this guy's looking at me. [gasps] Get out of our hangout. Or what? Aah! Aah! [scuffling sounds] [laughing] This isn't over, brad. You haven't seen the last of kick buttowski. [thunder rumbles] Best hangout ever! [gunther] how are we gonna get our hangout back, kick? Ooo, lingonberries. [burp] [fart] [burp] [fart] [burp, fart] Gunther. Sorry. No, do that again. What? This? [burp, fart] Oh, that? It happens any time i eat lingonberries. It runs in the family [burp] [fart] [fart] Sneak attack. No. They know we're coming. All part of the plan. Gunther, brad's gone. We've got our hangout back. In your dreams, dillweed. I don't know what this is, But since you have it, i want it. Whatever you do, don't open that. Quiet! I'm doing stuff over here. [fart explodes] [horace] it burns! [brad] oh, no! What could possibly make such a terrible stench? Aah! Fall back! Fall back! It's ours Come on, gunther, there's no time to rest. Why not? They're gone, and the hangout is ours. You said it yourself, remember? It's ours. So i did. But they'll be back. And we'll be ready. We will? [thunder crashes] [rustling] Mama. [gurgling] Freeze. The game's up. Oh, yeah? Gunther! I'm sorry, kick. They overpowered me. Ha ha ha ha! I surrender. Let him go. Put the balloon down, or the gunther gets it. Don't do it, kick! Zip it. That's right, dillweed. Now, get out of our hangout, Or else. Not without not my gunther. [scuffling sounds] Stay alive, gunther. No matter what happens, i will find you. Keep your eyes open, lame brain. You keep your eyes open, lamer brain. [yelps] Hey, i found something. It looks like a jumpsuit. Horace? Horace! [snaps] Slow down. You're going to make them too smooth. I don't know how to please you anymore. Just do it right. I'll take my gunther back now And our hangout. Horace! Pantsy! Looks like your boys are going to miss the party. Time to kick some buttowski. You want him? Come and get him. Gunther, go, go, go. [whooping] Victory is... I guess they didn't teach you How to tie knots in loser school. Ha ha! Good one. Get him! [boys laugh] I don't know, kick. Maybe we should just give up. No. I will never give up. Not while brad is down there. Today we fight for honor, for duty, for a hangout. My butt is wet. Aw, come on, brad. Let's just leave. Yeah. Boring. I know. This place stinks, But i'm not gonna let him have it. Not on my watch. [horn blares] There they are. This is your last chance. Leave our hangout, or... Face the ancient wrath of my people! Gunther, horns don't win wars. Awesome wins wars. No, kick, you don't understand. This horn... [grunts] No! Pantsy, cover the flank. [yells] Look out, horace! He's in the slop! [panting] [grunts] [shouts] [mimics machine gun fire] [mimics machine gun fire] [guns cock] They're reloading. Now! [roars] [all laugh] [cheetah growl] [rubber stretches] [grunts] Medic! Gunther! [growls] Any last words Before you eat knuckle, dillweed? The horn, kick, the horn! The horn. [horn blares] Ha ha ha ha! [heavy thuds approach] [battle cry] [all yell] [screaming] Retreat! We give up. You can have it. Well, we got our hangout back, thanks to your war horn. Oh, it's not a war horn. It's a dinner horn. My family will come from all ends of the earth if there's food. Oh, well, what's everyone eating? Lingonberry pie. [loud burp] [fart] [birds sing] [cat yowls] Awesome. Son, we need to talk. We're all concerned Your stunts may have gotten a little out of control. Only a little? [screams] [scanner beeps] [grunts] [whimpers] Aah! And that was just this morning, son. Kick, your mother and i have made a difficult decision. [man] attention! Kick, this is colonel payroll. He runs the haverbrook reform school for boys. Wait. You're sending me to... Military school! Whose lame idea was that? Hope you like crew cuts, loser. You're dangerous, buttowski. You're out of control. A loose cannon. You've got no discipline, No way to control your habit for stunts. A habit is something you can't control, Like when gunther cuts one. [fart] Couldn't stop if i wanted, And i don't. I can quit stunts anytime. You couldn't even go one hour without doing some stupid stunt. Oh, really? I'll do better than that. I'll go 24 hours without any stunts. That'll prove it's not a habit. And we forget all about sending me to reform school. Huh, that seems fair. What? Oh, come on! Now, now. If kick says he can do it, Well, then harold and i believe him. Sounds like we have a deal. But if you do so much as one little stunt, You're going to be signed up For a full year of discipline, Regimentation, And crew cuts! Deal. If anybody needs me, I'll be in my room... In control, not doing stunts. [clears throat] Starting now. Okay. 24 hours begins... Now. [bell tolls] Eight minutes, and you're doing so awesome, kick. Kick? [moaning] Maybe i can't do this, gunther. Maybe it's too much temptation. Maybe? Get rid of it, gunther, all of it. Now! Once you fail, i'm going turn your room into muscle beach. It's gonna be perfect. [yawns] So strong. So handsome. So brad. Must be the spandex. [kissing sounds] No way. Kick will never crack. He's too strong. He's too focused. [rummaging] he's... [gasps] no! Bad kick! No! [growling] [snarls] Hand it over. [groans] All of it. [whistles] [bell tolls] Well, this ought to keep you out of trouble. Nothing's getting in. Nothing's getting out. Now we just wait it out, And i can still enjoy the view. Maybe we ought to keep you away from the edge. What's the matter? Still think i'm out of control? No way, kick. I was just thinking why tempt... [ropes groan] kick! Stop! Don't do it! [giggles] The adrenaline feels so good! You're all mine now, buttowski. Hope you like crew cuts. No! Quick. Get me out of here. Perfect. [bells tolls] [gunther] my parents use this to get me to stop smelling my fingers. It's not my fault they smell delicious. [sniffs] [groans] Test it. [electricity snaps] Good work, gunther. With this thing, i'll definitely be able To stay away from stunts. [brad] you surprise me, dillweed. I thought you would have cracked by now. Cracking is for the weak. Or maybe you just haven't been tempted enough. Reeh! Is that a... A nitro-burning "hyper-septubulous" skate? Yes. Yes, it is. Not going to work, brad. I'm still in control. That's too bad, because the department of public works Has left this perfectly good sinkhole unattended. Can't hold out much longer. Kick, you got to resist, Or they're going to send you to reform school And we'll never get to hang out again. You can't resist. Feel the adrenaline. Sweet, sweet adrenaline. No adrenaline, kick! No! You know you want to. Must resist. [struggles] Rats. You're gonna have to do better than that. [sizzles] Come on. The kid's getting close. Look at the time. He's almost halfway there. You promised us. You said you would handle this, brad. Don't worry. I got one more trick up my sleeve. [panting] finally. No brad, no stunts, no nothing. We're safe. Kick, Why are you looking at me like that. Like what, blue? What did you call me? Blue. I think it's time to get some help. Must not do stunts. Need help coming down. Worry not because i'm gonna teach you... Lesson 1... Let nature be your ride. Partake. [both sniff] Ah. Lesson number 2... When some tries to harsh your mellow, You just let it go and roll like the dog. And now our final lesson, And i can't stress this enough. You got to know when it's time to kick back. [bell tolls] [bike bell rings] Well! If it isn't mr. Buttowski. I just happen to have These shiny new skates. Want to give them a try? Maybe later, chickadee. But right now i'm just gonna let it go. And roll like the dog. [growls, whines] [tires screech] hey, kick. You want to drag? Go on. You know you want to. [revs engine] Thanks all the same. [sniffs] Nature's my ride. Hey, dillweed. You think you've got this in the bag? You failed, brad, as usual. I still have three minutes. What could you possibly do in three minutes? [engine revs] Hey, brad, where did you get This awesome armored personnel carrier? Now where did i park my awesome armored personnel carrier? [ticking] Must not weaken. Go on, kick. Why don't you take a closer look? Can't you just feel the power? I jammed the accelerator open, So all you have to do is just release the parking brake. [laughs] Ha ha ha ha ha! Don't do it, kick. It's not worth it! This is a pretty sweet truck. It might be worth it. I've had just about enough from you, gunther. I'm not gonna let you stand in the way Of my ultimate muscle beach hangout. I'm not about to let you break up an awesome friendship! [engine revs] [tires screech] Yes. No! Well, i better get my biceps oiled up And invite the ladies over. Oh, kick, no! [sobs] Why so glum, chum? Kick! [bell tolls] You did it, kick. How did you resist? Sometimes you got to know when it's time to kick back. That's awesome. We are so proud. No reform school for you, son. No way. He totally cheated. It took a lot of work To grab that truck and soup it up and... Are you the one who stole my vehicle? Uh, no, sir. I just borrowed it for a little bit. Better come with me, son. You're out of control. Bye, brad. Hope you like crew cuts. Well, i've got some unfinished business to take care of. [cat yowls] [sniffs] ah, oh, yeah. [sniffs] Mmm.
