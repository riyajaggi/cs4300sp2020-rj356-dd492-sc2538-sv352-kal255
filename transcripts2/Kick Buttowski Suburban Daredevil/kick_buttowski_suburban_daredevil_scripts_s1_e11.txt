 [starts] Yeah, she'll do zero to 60... [engine stops] And one day monique here could be yours Monique? 228 days, my sweet, little... Back! Fingers! Now, back off. All right, that's good. Don't worry, dad. I'd never let anything happen to your car. Car? Monique isn't just a car. She's a companion, A best friend. I thought mom was your best friend. Shh. Monique doesn't know about your mother. [mother] harry, honey, Would you open this pickle jar for me? [nervous chuckle] Sounds like the cleaning lady needs some help. I don't want to see a fingerprint on monique when i get back. [shouts] what pickle jar? Don't be jealous, kick. When monique is mine, I might let you wash her. I think you and margaret there really deserve each other. [grunts] [laughing] Aah! It burns! [echoing] no! [laughs] you scratched dad's car. I don't think so. You scratched it. Hmm. Now, who would i believe? The innocent older brother or... The kid in the crash helmet? You're not going to blame this one on me. Yes, i am. No, you're not. Try to stop me. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What did i say about standing so close to monique? Oh, father, thank goodness you're back. Kick was doing one of his crazy daredevil stunts When he irresponsibly lost control [screams] [garbled] my tongue. I can't talk! What's that, son? I can't understand what you're saying, boy. I think he said he needs to go to the hospital. Right, brad. No! No, i didn't... Good idea, brad. We'll take my car. Yeah. Scratch! Scratch! Uh, what was that, brad? You think you might throw up on the way? Mom's car it is. The scratch. The scratch. There you go, nice and easy. Hurry. It sounds like it's getting worse. Don't worry, dad. I'll look after monique until you get back. Thank you, kick. I just don't know what i'd do if anything were to... Happen to her. [whimpers] He already scratched it. Quick, dad. For brad. Right. You're dead meat. What am i going to do about monique? [gunther] who's monique? Gunther, don't move. I didn't break anything. I know you didn't. Brad did. And if i don't get it fixed before dad gets home, I'm going to be grounded Till i'm old enough to drive. Have you tried using your time machine? I don't have a time machine, gunther, Or you could just tell your dad the truth. I don't know what i'd do if anything were to... [gasps] Happen to her. [cackles] I think i'll fix it myself. Besides, what could go wrong? There, good as new. Ew. You're right, gunther. I can't go through this Without some serious help. [cell phone rings] Wade here. Oh, sure thing. On my way. Now, what was i doing before the phone rang? [car crashes] Okay, here's the plan. Gunther, i need you to stall dad and brad While wade and i fix dad's car. Monique? Monique. So let me get this straight. You're asking us to help you cover up the truth? Not just cover it up. We need to bury the old truth Under a mountain of new and improved, Scratch-free, i'm-not-going-to-get grounded truth. Are you in? In? I've already got the shovel. You were being figurative, were you? Right, then, i'll just stall them at the hospital. [siren wails] [german accent] hello there. I am dr. Gunther... Uh, stein. Ah, yes. Very ugly indeed. [screams] Say "ouch." [slurs] ouch. Ah, just as i suspected. Is it serious, dr. Guntherstein? Could be, but he may have to stay overnight. Nice try, gunther. Can't you see? It's gunther. It's gunther! Nurse, we are going to need some restraints in here. [chuckles] how's it look, my man? Like it never happened. Oh, biscuits. Now, that's what i call bad karma. With a capital c. Good day, madam. Hey, you! No skateboarding. [cell phone rings] Talk to me. I don't know how much longer i can stall. Where are you? Getting close. See? Monique! No! For a second there it sounded like you said... Mr. Buttowski, sorry i'm late. But if you're the doctor, Then who's that? Hey, my wig. Hello? Hello? Look out! Double biscuits. I'm going to need to borrow this for a minute. Awesome. I can't believe you made that poor doctor jump out the window. Come on, dad. Can't you drive any faster? [motor whirring] Gunther! [cell phone rings] hello? You can stop stalling now. I'm heading home as we speak. Are you sure? Because i'm just starting to get the hang of it. Let me drive. That's right. You got your learner's permit. Well, you have had a tough day. As long as you're driving your mother's car, eh, why not? [engine cranking] Now, remember, bradley. Driving is a very serious responsibility! [engine cranking] [starts] And now to get you home. [engine stalls] [beeps] Gunther, i need you to pull out all the stops. Figuratively. Got it. Oops. Dropped my phone. No! [screams] [grunting] Hey, that looks just like my car. Except that my car has sweet, fuzzy dice hanging from the mirror. Oh, no you don't. Slow down, jackass! [coughs] What is... That? Found my phone. [screaming] [screaming] Whoa-ho-ho! Go, monique! [tires screech] [panting] quick, dad. Scratch! Scratch! Brad, i've had quite enough of this. Now, go to your room. Dad, i believe he said, "kick scratched your car." Yeah. Yeah. Scratch? Scratch! I don't see any scratch. Hah! Busted. What? But it was... it was right there. There, there, now. Dr. Guntherstein will make everything better. Come with me. I don't understand it. That door's always had a scratch there. Uh, nothing a little elbow grease can't take care of. Kick? You... You fixed it? Anything for monique, dad. You know, kick, Brad might be older, But you might get your hands on monique first. I'd be honored. [mother screaming] What have they done to you, my darling antonio! [together] antonio? [woman] thank you, kendall, for that exciting oral report On susan b. Anthony, A thrilling follow up to martin luther king, jr., Sitting bull, and who could forget, Gunther's report on rosie the riveter. All right, who's next? [kick] that would be me. All right, mr. Buttowski. Get ready for the historical figure To beat all historical figures... Dead man dave. [laughs] Excuse me, but who? We're discussing figures of historical importance here. Dead man dave is the father of modern skateboarding, A legend in the world of extreme sports. His motto... Do it all... And then some. But our story begins when he was still alive man dave. Dave built the very first custom skateboard And used it for every one of his death-defying stunts. That board is rumored to be imbued With his legendary skateboarding prowess And he wanted only his most worthy successor to have it. So your oral report is about some dead guy's magic skateboard? Dead man dave didn't need magic. He had skills, And only an equally skilled daredevil Could inherit his most treasured board, Which is why he hid it Deep in a booby-trapped cave That was lost to the ages... Until i found it yesterday. [students gasp] I remember it like it was yesterday. You really think dead man dave's board is down there? Check it. His autobiography. If you're reading this, You're not extreme enough You're not extreme enough to inherit my legacy. Three-hundred blank pages? Quite a bold publishing choice. Of course it is, gunther. I still don't get it. Dave wanted someone worthy to inherit his legacy of danger, And that someone is... Kick buttowski. And gunther. Solid wall. Oh, well, let's go home. I know it's here somewhere. But we're at a dead end. It's a wall. I don't believe in dead ends. Or walls. And neither did dead man dave. [gunther] are you sure this is a good idea? Trust me. This is one of dave's tests. There's got to be a better way. And there it is. [grunting] Kick, i'm not as athletic as i look. We'll find another way. Hey hey, watch out for those mushrooms. [screams] mushrooms! Your fear of fungus has served us well. Finally. Careful, gunther. This place is probably filled with booby traps. [laughs] you said boo... [rumbling] [both gasp] run! [gunther] hey, a tunnel. [kick] two tunnels. Let's go down the nice tunnel. No. This is how dead man dave separates the men from the boys. But i am a boy. Biscuits. A bottomless pit. I told you we should have gone into the nice one. I bet there was popcorn and drinks in there. There's only one way out of this. Oh, no. Oh, yes. Come on, gunther. Do it all... And then some. [teacher] uh, just one second here. So let me get this straight. You broke through a granite wall, Survived a chamber of killer stalagmites, Then dove feet first into a bottomless pit? Well, how else was i going to get the board? Proceed. [screaming] Relax, gunther. It's like skydiving. Except we don't have parachutes! Good point. Whoo-hoo! [kick] yeah! [gunther screaming] Hey, is sewage the same thing as poop? No. Are you sure? It tasted like poop. How would you know? Never mind. Chimichanga! [screams] [chomping] Objection! Mrs. Fitzpatrick, This circus is a waste of educational resources. This report makes no sense. Quiet, kendall! And then what happened? After we escaped the crocodiles And battled a race of subhuman cave dwellers, We found ourselves right outside... Dead man dave's hideout. [grunting] It's locked. Rats. Don't worry. Dead man dave hid a key somewhere in here. No, rats! That's more like it, dave. [screams] [animal roars] [growls] [roars] [kick grunting] [kendall] will someone please stop this insanity? A giant queen rat, you say? What you're describing is biologically inconceivable. Axle grease from dave's boards Causes extreme growth in rats. It's called science, kendall. I believe you, kick. [murmuring] Order! Order! Quiet down. Oh, i refuse to keep quiet. Ugh, not this again. He's innocent. He's innocent! He's innocent. [muffled] he's innocent! [no audible dialogue] Proceed, mr. Buttowski. Like i was saying, I had just been thrown into a wall by a giant queen rat. [roars] Kick, what are you doing? I am getting that key. [rat growls] [roars] [roars] Kick? [gulps] [growls] kick? Kick! [roars] [shudders] look. Wouldn't you rather eat a sandwich? Mmm. Yummy peanut butter. Oops. [blows landing] [shrieks] Kick? Are you in there? Come on, gunther. How did you get out of there? You don't want to know. You're totally hardcore. [kick] dead man dave's secret hideout. Look at all these boards. And all these salty snacks. Careful, gunther. Don't touch anything. Kick, you got it! Dead man dave's legendary skateboard! Not quite yet. [crashes] This is the one. Found some chips. Gunther, no! But i wasn't touching. Gunther, come on. Huh? [screams] Kick, i can't hold on. So, kick, we almost made it. No, gunther, we almost didn't make it. Here's how it's gonna go down. I let go of this ledge and swing us both into the air. I quadruple somersault onto that volcano Next to dave's skateboard, Flipping you backward onto the ledge. I grab the board, you hoist us up, And we're on our way. It's no use, kick. Leave me behind. Save the board. I'm replaceable. No, man. I'm gonna get you both. You can't do it all. I have to do it all... And then some. On three. One... Two... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You mean to tell me, out of a room full of golden skateboards, You chose the nasty old wooden wooden Held together by nails and duct tape? That's tight. And where's your proof, mr. Buttowski? Gunther's right over there, isn't he? Well, then, where is this super skateboard of yours? [all] eww! It's an oral report, kendall. Not show-and-tell. [class] eww! Well, your entire report was obviously fabricated. But i must admit, You entertained us all. You pass... Barely. I can live with that. Um, mr. Buttowski, School's not out yet. It's only 11:30. This means detention! Mr. Buttowski! Tell me, kick. How did you escape that giant queen rat? Well, that's easy, gunther. I just ran around in circles until i was all pooped out.
