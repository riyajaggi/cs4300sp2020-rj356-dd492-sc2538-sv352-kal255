 A motley crew of intrepid travelers creeping into pyramids by torchlight. Imagine, for a moment, that these people are you. ♪♪ Barreling towards an elusive, deeper truth. ♪♪ With that truth comes risk. With that truth comes danger. Is this really just a game? Or has it evolved into something else? ♪♪ Clara is real. SIMONE: Well, technically we don't know if she's real, we just know that the murals are real.

 JANICE: Well, somebody painted them. - Probably Clara. - Possibly Clara, yeah. If she did, then she is real, and she is missing. Guys, please, for once, can we just take this at face value? If what we've heard is true, then Clara, she might be in real danger. And she would be about 40. Here. This is 20 years ago. If this is her and she's real and she was a teen then, she's in her late 30s. If you want to find an artist, you follow the art. I mean, I'm not as much of a believer as my freakishly tall and recently unemployed friend here, but if Clara is real, then her murals are gonna lead us to her. It's provenance. So... So we follow the work back to the beginning and we find out as much as we can about whoever it is that painted them. And if that is Clara and she is real, then she's got, like, a last name or something, and... and we can find that out, and we can start there. Or we could just go back to playing the game like everybody else. How about that? That would be nice. You're all barking down the wrong tree. This isn't about some fictional girl that was enveloped in some long black coat and snatched away to a tower. You sound ridiculous. This is about an international conspiracy designed to control our behavior. A corporation. That is what they don't want us to chase down. We need to go back to all the locations that have been played in the game and connect them in some type of way. We need to trace them back to some common financial source, expose them, and end this. Guys, we have to look for Clara. ♪♪ Come on. ♪♪ Clara said, "I am you". Well, what if you were missing? What if you were missing? You. What if I was missing? Would anyone come looking for me? I don't think so. One of my saddest thoughts has always been that if something ever happened to me... like, if I slipped in the shower or if I choked a piece of sushi or something, that it would take weeks or maybe months for anyone to even know that I was gone. And so if Clara is me, like she said, then what she needs is someone to care enough to just look for her. Yeah, yeah. So we do both. Peter and I will find the waterfall, - and the two of you can go to the... - Oh, no. No. - No? - No. No, we don't do both? No, I'm not working with him. She's referring to me. Okay, I know you guys are mad at each other, - but can't we just... - No, no, no. He did something really awful and I'm not gonna work with him. Eh, it wasn't that bad. It was awful, and I'm not gonna work with him. Look, look, I know the two of you - are going through your little thing. - No. - But maybe you could just sort of... - No. Oh, my gosh, I'll go with Fredwynn. - Really? - What? - Oh, thank you. - Yeah. But Clara's so important to you. I know. She is. But, uh, yeah, I'm... I'm just gonna spend some alone time with Fredwynn. ♪♪ - And I with Janice. - Yes. - This is long overdue. - Long overdue. - Okay, this is gonna be fun. - Yes. - This is gonna be great. - Yes, so great. - Yeah. - So great. It's gonna be a really fun day. [CELLPHONES CHIME, VIBRATE] Ooh! PETER: "Attention combatants. Iron your robes and prepare for the forest. Clara's truth will be revealed tonight". Tonight? Oh, my God, it's the last day of the game. They know. They know that we're on to them. We don't have much time. After tonight, everything will be packed up, disbanded, the trail snuffed out. Like a magic carnival, everything will just disappear. We have to find the Wizard behind the curtain. We have to find Clara. In the name of all that is sacred, call it what you want, but we have to act now. Breakfast can wait. Blue team, activate! - Oh! - Oh, my God. Fredwynn! ♪♪ Wow. Fredwynn, your house is incredible. - Thank you. - Yeah. You may sit here. I need to go fuel up before we get started. [RAPID STIRRING] [GULPING] Ahh! [BEEPING] Wow. I've been working on this every day and night since my induction. This is a survey of every location we've been to since the "game" started. This is... a-a lot of work, Fredwynn. That night I spent at Clara's so-called house, I kept thinking, like, all this money they're spending on this game. Look. Look at these locations. Pop-up stores, theaters, museums. How much money does it cost to secure all of these places? Clara's house alone cost half a million dollars. Right, right, with the fire writing and the murals. FREDWYNN: I've looked into property records on the house. It's all shell corporations and dead ends. If we could find something connecting all of these things, a name... If we find a name, we find the mastermind. We could find Clara. If there is a Clara. I think there is. I know you do. Before we proceed, I need you to be clear. If you decide to help me with this... there's danger. There's darkness. The people that put this game together, they may not feel comfortable with us getting so close and asking all these questions, especially the right questions. - You okay with that? - I think I'm ready. There's risks. Torture, dismemberment, death. And it is real. They can waterboard me, Peter. But I will fight. They can attach electrodes to my testicles and let them go as long as they desire, but I will fight. I will fight back. I will take my two fingers and put them up their nostrils and rip everything they have in their brains out. And in doing so, I will be preoccupied with protecting myself, and I can't guarantee your safety. Sorry, I can't tell if you're joking at all. ♪♪ So this is where Peter and me learned about the Elsewhere Society and Commander 14 and all of that. Oh, the old Schmidt's sign is still here. I'm sorry, you've been here before? I don't remember a-a mural of a waterfall anywhere around here. But let's go ask. Come on. Um, Janice, I, uh... ♪♪ I-I just wanted to say I'm sorry about your husband. Oh. I didn't get a chance to say it before, so... And... And, like, I know we're not, like, close or anything, but if you ever wanted to talk about it... Thank you. I appreciate that. I do. Um... But I'm... I'm just so in the middle of it, I... I don't even know what I'd say, so let's play the game. - Okay. - You go. You go first. ♪♪ Nothing left to see here. It's all been cleared out. Okay, well, we're here about this waterfall mural that used to be outside. - You remember? - Waterfall? I don't know anything about that. Sorry. Shit. BORIS: Janice? Janice the Menace? It's me! Boris! Boris Dabrowski! Do you know him? I know him. I know him. Ah. Oh, Boris! Oh! Oh! My, my, it's been a long time. - It sure has. - Yes. What's your name, gorgeous? Oh. Back off, Boris. Just back off. How do you guys know each other? Oh, Janice was the outspoken feminist of the day. - What? - Debating the Equal Rights Amendment, protesting police violence down at the City Hall, and all-night poetry slams. Well, that was just once. Just once. You can see me through the obsidian of my mind's eye. Capturing you in time lapse. The leonine struggle of our sisterhood. [FINGERS SNAPPING] Wow. Janice. Yeah. Boris. Oh, Boris. You just sit yourself down right here. Just have yourself a seat. Boris, you... you have been in Philly, like, forever, probably right here in this building. So, tell me, do you recognize any of these murals? - My memory is not what it used to be. - Well, whose is? But maybe it'll improve if you give me a little kiss. - Ugh! - Ugh, no, sir. Boris, for God sakes, it didn't happen then, and it sure as hell is not gonna happen now. What do you mean it didn't happen then? - It happened then! - It most certainly did not ha... Uh, barkeep, could we have three tequilas right now? Here, keep the change. Alright. Down the hatch. ♪♪ Whew! Ooh! ♪♪ Boris... you owe me. For the shot or the shtup? Ugh. Both. No. No. Wait, I recognize that one. That's out on Norris by those old tenements, I think. - Oh, Boris. - Oh, I-I know where that is. Yes, thank you, thank you, thank you. You're the best, the best! Well, no, actually you were not the best. Not by a long shot! ♪♪ ♪♪ Wow. Induction. Where it all started. It's just gone. This is where he told me I was special. ♪♪ Fredwynn. ♪♪ _ Not you, too, Store of Beautiful Things? ♪♪ They're covering their tracks. They're taking it away from us. This was... magic. This is where I met Simone. There was that song playing. [HUMMING "LUNAR RHAPSODY"] ♪♪ "Lunar Rhapsody", Doctor Samuel Hoffman. She scared me right over there. ♪♪ She still does, I-I guess. In a good way, but... I'll give you one piece of advice. If she gives you her heart, don't take out a magic marker and write all over it. ♪♪ That's such specific advice. ♪♪ Focus. We don't have much time. Okay. So, Bigfoot came from here. - We danced in this area. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Best night of my life. - Hmm, hmm. I'm sure that was magical. Focus! Okay. The cool phone is gone. It's gone! They put this one in instead. Commander 14, hi. I was just... I was joking. Stop playing games. We have a mission. - Okay. - And don't slow me down. You know, you can be really challenging sometimes. Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Peter, if I'm challenging to you, but while you're dilly-dallying with this phone... Excuse me. Let go of the phone, Fredwynn. We're watching you. We're everywhere. Return to the game as instructed, now! [RAPID BEEPING] ♪♪ [INDISTINCT TALKING] ♪♪ ♪♪ Something's off. What do you mean? Well, it's not complete. All of the Clara stuff that we've seen so far has been super easy to identify, like the waterfall, the window. This is, like, half of something. Well, maybe the other half is gone, like it was... it was painted over or something, and we... we have to look carefully where that paint happened, and you can chip it off, and underneath would be the... - What? - No, Janice. This is all there ever was. Alright, okay, I see. We're missing something. Well, it's here, it's here. BERTHE: Psst! Berthe. Mon chéri. I can't crack this. Of course you can. When I paint myself looking out the window, which I've done many times, what am I doing? You are... painting... outside... from inside. You're getting warmer, kid. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ We need to go there. - Yeah? - JANICE: Hello. We're with the Elsewhere Historical Society. [SCOFFS] Nice try, darling. The Elsewhere Historical Society doesn't exist. Well, we're new. Hello. I'm Janice Foster, founder and CEO. Yes. And, uh, we think you might be a landmark. Me? Well, no, um, the apartment. If our records are accurate, there could be a substantial grant involved. Could we just come in, take a quick look around? I need to see some ID. Well, of course you are. That's very prudent of you. You never know who we might be. Just random people off the street. Dangerous times. Hey, your name wouldn't happen to be Clara, would it? I don't think so. Okay. Come on in, then. Oh, thank you so much. You'll get these back when you leave. Oh, that's always good to hear. Oh, boy. Homey. [CHUCKLES] Just... very tasteful. Um, you can't find this kind of... Can you tell me, how... how long have you actually lived here? - Uh, 37 years. - Oh. But I was down the hall with my husband until 1993. He was the building manager. I see. Okay. That's, uh, good to know. SIMONE: This wallpaper. Did you, uh... Did you put it up your... It's lovely. Oh, is it lovely. Thanks. Don't do that! That's a... That's a... That's a fire hazard. We'll glue it right back, and then you'll be safe from... fire. Okay. ♪♪ [CAT MEOWS] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ A dragon. That's beautiful. Do you happen to know who lived here before you? Was it a young woman, by any chance? I don't know. But I have all my husband's old leases. I'm sure that you do. ♪♪ I came here with Janice. On Jejune day. This museum is key. This is a preexisting location. So there's no way... Whoever made this game, they can't just destroy it like they did the other places. I understand, I understand. It's closed today, but there's a clue inside, - and I'm sure of it. - Okay. What do we do? What's the plan? - [CAR ALARM BLARING] - Fredwynn. Is he coming? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Okay. Now. Go. ♪♪ ♪♪ Fredwynn, this is breaking and entering. No one is forcing you to be here. ♪♪ I'm going to enter my memory palace, see if I missed something, to understand the pattern. Okay. You should teach me to enter mine, as well. Yes, maybe later. Well, you taught Janice how to enter hers, so... There was a clue there. Maybe there's a clue in mine. You were never here, Peter! I'm just saying, if you let me help you, then we... There... There's two of us... I'm not running a memory palace charitable foundation. Stop it. If you want to be of service, procure me an item to maintain my blood sugar. Did you just tell me to get you a snack? PETER: [ECHOING] Fredwynn. Look at me. I'm your teammate. Fredwynn. Fredwynn. Did you just tell me to get you food? I'm not... ♪♪ [MUFFLED SHOUTING] ♪♪ [DISTORTED CAROUSEL MUSIC PLAYING] ♪♪ ♪♪ [CLATTERING] I'm not some idiot. I'm quiet. Terrible teammate. There's no "I" in "team". There's no "I" in "Elsewhere Society". There's no... There's no "I" in "Elsewhere". You want a snack? Here's your snack. Got you a snack, Fredwynn. [ECHOING] Terrible teammate. Fredwynn. [DISTORTED MUSIC CONTINUES] ♪♪ FREDWYNN: Clara. This isn't about you. You're not real. Stop infiltrating my mind. ♪♪ PETER: [ECHOING] Fredwynn? ♪♪ [LAUGHTER] ♪♪ Hey! ♪♪ Not real. ♪♪ Where? [ECHOING] Where? Where? Where?! Where?! Where? - Show me. Show me. Where. - Fredwynn, Fredwynn. - Where? Where? Where? - Fredwynn. Fredwynn! You're... Fredwynn, you're... you're freaking out. [EXHALES SHARPLY] Hey, hey. You're here. It's okay. She wanted me to see this, but I don't know why. - Who? Who wanted you to see? - Clara! You saw her? Something is here! Okay. But I don't know where! Fredwynn, calm down. - Where, Clara, where?! Where?! - It's okay. - Where? Where?! Where?! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Fredwynn, Fredwynn, Fredwynn. - I know this! - I know. I'm never off! Shh. It's okay. - I'm never off. - I know. - I know, you're never off. - It's here. I know it is. I know it is. [SIGHS] That helped. This is a toy orange that I got you to be passive-aggressive. I don't feel that way anymore. But you can still have it to commemorate the day. ♪♪ What is this? ♪♪ This logo. It was on the key chain at the induction. ♪♪ No. And... And the phone booth. ♪♪ The same people made all of these products. These products are connected to every location in the game. ♪♪ It's Bender Elmore. They make consumer products. They also do scientific research and big tech. That's how they were able to secure every location in the game... because they own them. Whoever created this game works at Bender Elmore. Yeah. You knew something. How did you know something? They own my company, too. ♪♪ Let's go. We need to get into your previous employer and get into the computer system and get a name. We can't. It's a high-security building. They've taken away my clearance. Oh, this is our Ethan Hunt moment. You be Ethan, and I'm Hunt. Team, right? We're a team. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Alright. Unless you want to be Hunt, but you're more Ethan. - Yeah. - Either way. Look, even if we got in there, which we won't, I was just a low-level employee. All I could do was access playlists. Just get me in front of a computer, I will handle it. - You'll handle it? - Peter, I will handle it. Okay. ♪♪ - Fredwynn, Fredwynn. - Oh. Oh, that's just Lupito. Our Lyft driver.

Like, at the bar when you were sweet-talking that smelly drunk and... and then here when you were charming the pants off of Martin Scorsese's mom. [CAT PURRING] People are just people. All you have to do is talk to them. I don't know. I'm just afraid that they're gonna... See you? Judge you? Yes. And yes. Simone, you listen to me. You be you, with your dimples and your long, long legs, for God sakes. And if anybody has a problem with that, you tell them to come talk to me. Thank you. I get the feeling you used to be sort of a badass, Janice. I don't know. Maybe I was. Or maybe I'm becoming one. Attagirl. [LAUGHS] Oh, wait, oh, wait. July 1999. I-Is that the date on the photo? - Yeah. - Oh, my gosh! The person on this lease, they were... they were here when the mural was painted. - It'll be in the back. - I know it's in the back.

Yes. And this exercise, it's vital for his recovery. Human to human, he needs this. I need it. - Five minutes. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Leslie. You know, I didn't think it was possible for somebody to have zero footprint on the Internet, but it's like this girl was erased or something. Doesn't help that the local papers never digitized. Yeah. Ohh. Microfilm machine. This I can do. I can't tell you how many reports I helped my son Ben with. Yeah, my mom, too. That's what moms do. Just think, everybody else is getting ready for a fun-filled finale while we turn into Team Encyclopedia Brown. [CHUCKLES] Why does any of this matter? You mean, like, existentially? No, I mean to you. Well, um... Clara had a tough time. The world was a hostile place for her, so... And I have no idea what that is like. [CHUCKLES] ♪♪ I got it. September 2000. Well, that's a year after the murals. It says, "Clara Torres, 19, was reported missing after she disappeared from her apartment on the evening of September 3rd. Foul play has not been ruled out, as neighbors saw a woman shrouded in black". "Previously hospitalized, Clara Torres is considered to be a danger to herself". Shit, Clara had problems. It can happen to the best of us. We should find out what hospital she was in. Maybe there's a doctor there who will remember her. I'm gonna look up local psychiatric wards. I know where they took her. Where? They took her to Hawkton. ♪♪ ♪♪ [TELEPHONE RINGING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN DISTANCE] Okay, come on, Fredwynn. This is your moment, man. [KEYS CLACKING] Okay.

What was the song we danced to with Bigfoot? "Play that Beat Mr. DJ". G.L.O.B.E. and Whiz Kid. Can't believe you remember that. Of course, I remember everything. Okay. [BEEP] Yes. I think I'm onto something here. This game has had a very, very unique soundtrack. If the person who made this playlist was using this software, which, if they own the company, - seems very likely... - Right. Try Isaac Hayes. "Run Fay Run". Please Touch Museum, day two. [BEEP] Yes. Yes, okay. What was playing at the Fishtown bar? I don't know. I wasn't at the Fishtown bar. Right. Um, it was, like, a romantic duet. Do you know that song? Sing some of it. I don't...

Yes, we... we... we found an apartment - where she lived with one of her murals - Creepy. inside and outside. We found her full name on the lease. We found a newspaper article... She's disappeared at least once before, and... and she was, uh, hospitalized here. This used to be a-a mental health facility. And maybe there's still records or someone might remember her, but since there's a fitness center where the admissions desk should've been, I-I don't feel very hopeful. Right. Guys, thank you.
