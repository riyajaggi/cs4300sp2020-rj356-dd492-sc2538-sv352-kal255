 ♪ La vie s'en va ♪  [Music stops]   [Cheering intensifies]  [Whistle blaring in distance]   Up-temp music plays]  [Cheering continues]  Black...trans...  lives...matter!  Protect trans women!  We have the right   to resist.  [Sound fades]  [Music thumps distantly]  [Cheering distorts]  [Distorted shouting]  ♪ Moi j'tue le temps,   chantant des airs épris ♪  Octavio: So much love  staring her right in the face, and yet she turns  and runs away.  This is Simone.  Think of Simone as you.  Simone is you  if you woke up every morning   believing today  would be the day   you could finally be happy,  not realizing that you  were the only obstacle   standing in your way.  Simone is you  if you never truly felt   a part of anything.  ♪♪  Simone is you   if, your whole life,  you felt like you'd been   invited by mistake.  ♪♪  Simone is you if you finally   worked up the courage  to do the one thing   you knew was going  to make everything different,  the thing that would at last   fill the hole that had  been silently growing within,  only to find   something terrifying  waiting on the other side.  You still felt   exactly the same.  Simone is you if you were   beginning to wonder  if maybe, just maybe,  you're always going to feel... alone.  ♪♪  ♪♪  ♪♪  [Indistinct talking]  ♪♪  ♪♪  ♪♪  ♪♪  [French accent] Does it   really have to say  "woman impressionist"?  I've never heard them say   "Rodin, male sculptor."  Have you?  I think they were trying   to highlight --  I don't need you   transplaining to me. "Berthe Morisot,   Impressionist"  would have been   just fine.  Put me on a wall   next to Renoir,  and let history decide. Son of a bitch   stole all my moves. That's not exactly true,   but --  What do you   know about it?  I have an art degree.  [American accent]   "I have an art degree." Easy, Berthe.  Hey, um...  Can I ask you   something?  [Sighs]   [Normal voice Hit me. In all your paintings,   you're alone.  But are you, like...  lonely?  Or are you comfortable  knowing that you're  this boundary-busting woman,  making her way   in a man's world?  Are you hoping I co-sign  your whole solitude thing? Maybe.  I am not lonely.  I am married to Manet. I painted our whole family.  They're in the next room. You work here.   You know that.  Look, I'm art.  I will be...   whatever you want me to be, but seriously, girlfriend, don't you think it's time  that you --  [Whispers] Simone.   Jesus!  [Whispers] Carl!  When you sneak up on somebody  and whisper their name, it is incredibly creepy. Well, you're whispering,   too.  That's because   it's the rules.  And because   you're my boss  and because   I haven't said anything out loud yet today. He is way, way,   way too close.  Carl,  he's just, like...   an old-timey man  or, like, a vampire trying  to enjoy the art.  What is the big deal? Simone, you have two jobs --  one to give people information   about the art,  and, two, don't let people get  way, way, way too close.  Go.  [Footsteps depart]  Sir...   [Clears throat]  Sir, I'm gonna   have to ask you  to step away   from the painting.  Sir?  Sir, I'm gonna   need you to --  Jesus Christ!  How did you get in here   like that?  Hmm.  Oh, my God.  It's the game.  The game is back.  [Gasps]  I really needed   this today.  You have no idea.  Okay, what's next?  Uh, are you the clue?  Are we finding Clara?   Do I have to dance?  Because I mean,   I might get fired,  but I will dance.  Come on, clue, please.  Come on, clue, clue,   clue, clue, clue.  Let's go.  Where are you going?  Bigfoot.  Bigfoot.  Bigfoot.  Bigfoot, please!  [Sighs]  ♪♪  "If your power feels gone   and you wish that it weren't,  look to the east   for the flow of the current.  You'll need some new tools   and a ticket to ride.

Look up.  Oh! Hi. Okay.   What are you --   [Chuckles] Hey.  Hi.   What are you doing here? We got a clue.  Remember the game?   How did you get in here?  'Cause you're not wearing  a badge, and there's protocol.  I just said   I was here to see you and that I wanted   to make it a surprise. Oh, by the way,   from now on,  today is your birthday. [Chuckles nervously]  You seem really   uncomfortable.  Well, I'm embarrassed.  Oh.  I'm sorry, yeah.  Uh, I should --  My work --  This is my work,   and it's --  it's really boring here.  I don't want you   to see me this way.   Huh?  It's really boring here,   and I'm --   O-- Oh?  I'm embarrassed  that you're seeing me like this. Oh. I thought --   Sorry.  I'm really happy to see you.   [Sighing] Okay.  Sorry I got weird.   Okay.  This --   This is gonna be fun. Okay.   Remember fun?  Yeah, I do.   Okay.  What do you think... these are for?  Fish Food.  I don't know what that is.  Me neither.  Peter, someone dropped   this off for you.  Happy birthday,   by the way.  Thank you.  Okay.  "I'm starving,  but I'm a picky eater.  I only eat at home."  Okay. So, think.  Where does a fish live?  Um, pet store, aquarium,  a river, ocean.  A-Are we just supposed to find  every body of water in Philly until we find   this robot fish's house? Peter.  I think I know   where this fish lives. Yes!   Yes.  Yes!   Yeah.  Go, Peter!   Yes.  Yeah, dude.   That is the spirit.  Let's do it.  ♪♪  [Intercom beeps]  Bus driver: Next stop...  So, about this job   of yours...  Oh, yeah.   You act all embarrassed. I don't know why.   You work in music.  That's cool as hell. Actually, I work in data,   not in music.  I categorize   and label.  The data happens   to be about music,  but honestly,  it could be anything.  Oh.  Well, what kind of music  do you listen to?  I don't really have  a strong preference.  Like, if there's music   on somewhere,  I accept it.  Do you own a CD?  Or, like, a tape   or a record?  No.  Oh, actually,  that's not entirely true.  I once had to drive  to a funeral in Maryland,  and someone   had left a CD  in the car  that I rented from Avis,  so when I tried to return it,  they said they didn't want it.  I got to keep the CD,   so, yeah,  I listen to that   sometimes.  Okay.   Yeah.  Now we're getting somewhere.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What CD was it?  Um, "Les Misérables,"  original London cast.  Okay.  That is cool.  Oh, good.  What about you?  What about me?  Like, I don't know.  What do you do for work?  Oh.  I'm a docent.  I work at the museum. Oh, wow!   That is super cool.  I don't know what a docent is,   but --  [Chuckles] Um...  I answer questions   about the art.  I have an art degree.  Wow.  I was gonna go back  for my master's, but I -- I had to drop out.  Why?  Uh...  just, like, life stuff. Uh...  Let's not talk   for a little while. Next stop --   you tensing up and saying  something unintentionally mean  for no reason.  For your safety,   watch your step.  I'm sorry.  I'm in a weird mood today. I'm like bitter Amelie  or something.  Oh. Y-- You're fine.  "Anomaly."  What?  I -- Well, I think  it's pronounced "anomaly."  I don't want to be   grammar police.  Oh.  Amelie?   Right.  You keep saying "Amelie"  but you're missing the "noma."  "Anomaly."  [Laughs]  You've never seen   the French film "Amelie," have you?  No.  [Laughs] Peter,   you are a trip.  Look, the point is,  today is gonna be great. We are gonna   have a blast.  Deal?  Yeah, deal.  ♪♪  Peter.  Well done, sir.   Should we feed the little guy? Oh, yes, yes, yes.  I like to do...   the ups first  and then the downs...  second.  Ready?  3, 2, 1, fish.  [Button clicks]  [Button clicks rapidly]   You know...  maybe the batteries are dead  or, like --  Hey, down here.   It's me, Clara.  Thank goodness you're here.  I've been hiding a long time.  The truth is,   I've been hiding so long,  I've forgotten where I am,  and I need you to find me.  What do you say?  Come on,   let's take to the streets.  I've got some things   to show you.  ♪♪  So, here we are,   taking it from the top.  This is where I grew up.  Fishtown's a lot nicer   than when I lived here.  You definitely wouldn't   want to be here at night,  or even in the day, really,  but even then, it was magic.  Take a look around.  There's magic everywhere,   once you learn how to see it.  Maybe you're not buying this.  Maybe you're not seeing   the magic quite yet.  Sometimes, you just need   a new pair of glasses.  At least that's what   Mr. Salazar always said.  Good ol' Mr. Salazar.  Say hi to him for me   if you see him.  Okay.  So, we're supposed   to explore Fishtown. That'll help us   find Clara.  Maybe this is, like, a --  a scavenger hunt or something. It's Amelie.  Peter, you don't even   have to see it now.  We are in   frickin' Amelie.  Except instead of Paris,   it's Philly,  but what are you gonna do?   Right.  No, that's true.  Okay, clues.  Clues. Think.  Think. Think.  "Sometimes, you just need  a new pair of glasses." Yes.  So, we need to find  the Fishtown optometrist.  Yes! Yes!  I hope not,   because that sounds like such   a boring adventure. Yeah.  Okay. Think.  Mr. Salazar.   Glasses...  I think I've got it.

If you find her, will you   give her a message for me?  Yes.   Of course.  Tell her we don't need her   anymore.  Tell her old Sal said   thanks for nothing.  She broke her promise!

[Grunting]  Okay.  ♪♪  Animated Commander 14:   Agents of Nonchalance,  welcome to the headquarters   of the Elsewhere Society.  I'm your humble servant,   Commander 14,  current spokesperson   for this clandestine band  of determinedly   optimistic misfits.  While we have no   organized leadership,  you may think of me   as your skipper, honcho,  chairperson,   padrone, or sachem.  All these informal titles   I accept  with great humility and care.  Today, fellow Nonchalants,   I am pleased to be your guide  through this short   but informative  auto-flip entitled...  This presentation   will be comprised  of three easy-to-understand   and informative sections.  Section one!  The Elsewhere Society   is a disorganized collective  of currently human souls   dedicated to the preservation  and reverse obfuscation   of the beauty entitled to us  by the very nature   of our membership  in the divine wonders   of existence.  Is this clear?   Excellent.  Moving on.   Section two!  Our mission is to nurture the   divine ember of our movement,  the one who will help   bring Elsewhere  to every corner of humanity --  Clara.  Of utmost urgency   is to protect her  from the opportunistic   and greed-driven clutches  of the amoral and corrupt   Jejune Institute,  led by the power-mad   Octavio Coleman, Esq.  Got it?   Good. Next!  One by one,   our fellow citizens  are seduced by the myth   that Elsewhere is  beyond the reach   of the ordinary woman and man, that we are not enough,   that we are unworthy,  unlovable, incapable,   or just plain too busy.  Some have come to believe that  Elsewhere itself is a myth.  Others have bought   into the fallacy  that there is only so much   Elsewhere to go around.  Too many of us believe   that the answer  is not to join the safari  but instead buy a ticket   to the zoo.  Remember not to leave   without your T-shirt,  plush toy, and Animal Crackers. Crunch! Cruuuu--  Wait.  Wait. Some--   Something's wrong.  [Panting] I know.   I'm just so tired.  Keep pedaling.   It's almost over.  Okay. Okay.  [Whirring]   Oh, God.  Oh, my goodness, gracious.  [Clicking resumes]  ...ruuunch!  But not us, my friends.  We must rise above,   climb to the tallest rooftop,  behold the golden dome,  and gaze down   at the beauty below,  uncorrupted by   the burden of commerce  and see the world   for what it is.  Carry the message.  Elsewhere is ripe   for the taking.  Join us.   Join the resistance!  Follow the setting sun   and find her!  Find Clara!  And victory will be ours!  [Sighs]   It's over.  [Panting] Oh, my God.   Thank God.  [Whirring slows, stops]  That...   was amazing.  Peter, that was, like,  one of the --  I feel like you're in   better shape than this.  I was pedaling   so, so fast.  You couldn't see.  You had the easy job.  You're right.  You're right.   You want to switch? Yes, yes.  Oh, okay.  [Siren blares]   Oh, come on!

Me too.   Yeah.  I'm having a nice time.  I'm glad.  What's your   favorite part?  Um...  You know that voice  that either tells you you're doing great   or you're a piece of shit? I'm not sure.  Lucky you.  Well, right now,   she's quiet.  Also, I guess I like that  if anybody's looking at us, it's just 'cause   you're holding a fish. [Laughs]  Maybe in regular life  if people are looking at you,  it's 'cause   you're very pretty.  Peter.  Are you afraid   of heights?  Probably.   Why?  ♪♪  ♪♪  [Panting] Oh!

I was scared the first time   I said it out loud.  "I can see magic here."  I was scared no one   would understand  or that people might   even laugh at me,  but then I realized  magic isn't any fun   if you're alone.  What do you say   we give it a try?  There must be something   you're holding inside  that you're too afraid   to say out loud.  What if you just said it  and learned it wasn't   so scary after all?  Turn to your partner.  Go on.

And I don't know what  I'm supposed to call that thing, but I do know   that I heard music  when I saw you  after I danced with Bigfoot.  Not figuratively.   Literal music.

I'm gonna go   back to work.  Um, I had   a very nice day,  and I'm ready   to be alone now.  So I'm gonna   give you this fish,  and I'm sure that   I'll see you again.

The thing   about crap is,  trying to hide it  doesn't really do you much good. You know why?   Why?  Because it stinks.  [Both laugh]  Like shit.  Crap stinks like shit, even if you've got it  hidden in a bag.  You got nothing to lose  by just being honest and saying, "Hey,   I just want to tell everyone I've got a crap in this bag,  and it stinks."  Does it solve   your problem?

It's a fantasy.   Jejune is the real world. Why can't the real world   be more like Elsewhere?  Fredwynn: They're trying   to divide us.  They want us   to choose.  We can do both.   Oh, no, Fredwynn,  it clearly says in the text  here th--  I refuse to acknowledge  false dictatorial constructs.  Protest is at 7:00.  The shareholders meeting   is at 7:30.  That's 20 minutes away on foot   if one walks  at a sprightly pace,   which I always do.  We can do both.  Get twice the information,  be twice as informed  as those lemmings out there   choosing sides.  Can we agree   that I'm right?  Well, I-I m-- I me--  I take that as a yes.  Let's go.   Okay.  Wish Peter was here.  Me too.   I'll text him.  He gave you his number?  I did a reverse trace.  I have all   your numbers.  Well --  Let's go.  Oh.  All: [Chanting] "Clara, Clara!   She will save us!  Down, down, down!   Down with Octavio!  Okay. I'm gonna   infiltrate the crowd  and gather as much information   as I can, okay?  Me -- Me too.   And then we got   to hustle.  Yeah.   We're a real team now. I'm gonna knit hats with  everybody's name on -- wha--? Are you gonna be alright?  I'm good. I'm good.  Go.   Fredwynn!  Fredwynn, don't leave me!   Fredwynn!
