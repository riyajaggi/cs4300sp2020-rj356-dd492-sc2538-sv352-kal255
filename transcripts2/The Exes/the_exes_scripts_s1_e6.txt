I'm always gonna be my mom's little girl. Even though I do like, tower over her. Good morning, everyone. I didn't know what kind of breakfast treats you all like, So I just got an assortment. - Oh, that was very thoughtful. - Yeah! - No, no, don't eat those! - What? Why not? It's her bad news basket. Okay, she gave me one just like it When she asked me to work new year's. Take one bite, and you're her bitch. I already took a bite. Look, don't listen to her. Eat up, all right? I mean have a scon-- try a crumpet, those are yummy! Wait a minute! You didn't tell your mother. - Now we're stuck in the land technology forgot. I tried. I was ready to, and then she wouldn't take the wine. She wouldn't take the wine! She told me she was gonna stay And help me plan my entire wedding. And then she told me she was proud of me. - And then I-- - you just crumbled. Big time. All she ever talks about is my sister Jill And how perfect her life is And how perfect her marriage is and... for once, I wasn't the pathetic loser Sitting at home alone on a Saturday night Waiting for her assistant to bring over files So she could bury herself in work.

You've been lying to me for eight months. Every time we talked on the phone. Every time I brought up Brad and the wedding, It was all a lie. We went to a bridal shop. You picked out a wedding dress. And it was all a lie. What did I do? What kind of mother have I been To make you feel you couldn't tell me. Honey, I am so sorry. Really? You're sorry? Well, what did you think I was going to say? Something like that. I-I-I don't get it. Your sister tells me everything. That's it. That's why I didn't say anything. It's Jill. It's always about Jill. How Jill leads the perfect life. It's not that. Jill's not perfect. She's just...Married. I--I get married. I don't get-- Me. You don't get me. No, honey, you know I'm so proud of you. I just want you to be happy. I don't want you to be alone. Mom, I am happy, okay? And I don't know if I'm ever gonna get married. But, I'm not alone. I've got those three guys in the kitchen. Trust me, they're a lot better for me than Brad was. Ugh, that Brad makes me sick. To think you had to go through The pain of that all by yourself. It broke my heart. I know. Know what breaks my heart? You never gave me a chance to do this. Come on. Can we come out now? Tighter, mommy. Mmm.
