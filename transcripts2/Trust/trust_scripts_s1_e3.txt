Well, it's nothing we can't sort out. I miss you. They miss you. Why don't you come home, Paul? Are you coming home, Paul? - Uh, maybe. - Away. - We're talking. - Okay. What kind of trouble? Money trouble, mostly. - Oh, Paul. - I was doing okay, - I really was... - I don't have much myself. Your father hasn't sent me anything since January. He doesn't take my calls. I don't know what that's about, but... It's my, um... rainy day money. Mom. You know I can't take that. Take it. Paul's come for lunch. Greenbacks for lunch. Mmm, tasty. - Lang... - Scrounging for money, huh? There's always... plenty of work in the garden. - Please. - Five dollars an hour. That's a fair offer. I mean, I'm working for free, right? What? Scared of a little hard work, huh? You don't even know what that is. - Fuck you. - Paul... Yeah, you wouldn't like that, would you? Poor little rich kid might get a sweat on, and that's not the Getty way, is it? No, the Getty way is to do fuck all and wait for the inheritance to roll in. You think I'd come home? With him in the house? I'd rather beg on the street. Oh, yeah, that's right, run away. How can you go anywhere near him? He's disgusting. - You're disgusting. - Paul. Don't talk to your mother like that. You see his eyes? He's on something, he's definitely on something. He was gonna come home. How much money did you give him? You're such a jerk. Hey, has anyone seen my passport? Is this what she gave you? How is this going to help? - It's enough. - For what? To get me to England. To go begging for money from Daddy, like the little rich kid I am. Right? Wait. Paul. Hey, Paul. You're going to England? When will you be back? - Paul, I'm sorry. - About what? This. Marcello. You know? Hey, I-I thought... you know, we said it was okay. Didn't we? Yeah, that's what we said. In honor of my successor in Getty Oil... ...my grandson John Paul Getty III. John Paul Getty III. Go to Mommy, go to Daddy, go wherever the fuck and get my money! Is this necessary? Oh. Sunflowers. Ah, but they're all dying. Like everyone. Got any water? No. Look, I messed up, okay? I'm sorry. I-I got desperate, you know? The coke, and... I went a little crazy, but I'm better now, really. Hey, I'm not going anywhere. Ow. So, do they really follow the sun? Only when they are young. This is the countryside, huh? Well, that's... that's cool with me. Ah. Man, you got my books, too, Berto? - I could do with something to read. - Shh! Shut up! What's going on? Berto? Ooh, whoa, whoa. What's happening here? Wait, wait, wait, what's happening here? I said shut up! Here. Don't move. What's this? Uh... This isn't what we agreed. Change of management. What? No. No way. Please, don't speak. Fuck this. Fuck. Hey, no. Bertolini. Per favore. Per favore. - Okay. - Ah. Come. Primo. Primo, per favore. Paul? Are you coming? Paul? Paul? Paul? ♪ Wow! ♪ Oi. Mm, no. No, I can't. Please. Come in. Come in. Move! I haven't got the money. One look. One look, I see that. But I can get it... and more. This is like an old song. I am tired of singing, Paul. This is gonna make you rich. Very rich. Giovanni? Walk with me. Dolce? What happened with Martine and Jutta? You... you... Stupid bitch nearly killed us all is what. Too much cocaine for everybody. - It's bound to work out. - Strange... It won't go wrong 'cause we're working together, you and me. - Yeah? - Hmm? Hey, what about the rewards? A hundred times more than what I owe you. Ah, the rewards. Beautiful view from up here. In Roman times those who betrayed... the untrue, the liars... they were thrown from this rock, this one. An interesting place to choose, don't you think? Yeah. I don't know, yeah. Not too high, not too low. Enough to kill you, but not instantly. That's the genius. You lie at the bottom, a-a bag of broken bones. People pass on the way to work, school, the restaurants, all the places you used to go without a thought. And in the middle of this coming and going, you die very slow, very public, very painful. Whoa. Jesus. What are you doing?! If this goes wrong, if you betray me, I swear I will throw you from this rock, Paul, just like the old Romans. - You understand? - It won't go wrong. - Understand? - It won't go wrong. How can it? Jesus Christ. This could be good, no? Fuck. Look who it is. Please. You want me to stay? Why is he here? He helped us. Hey, Martine... You left us... with that pig Bertolini. Well, I was getting the money. - You know that. - They tried to rape us. - Who? - Bertolini's disgusting friends. Jesus. Tell us you have the money, Paul. I didn't know he would do that. I wouldn't have left you... Just tell us you have the money. - I have something better. - Ah, Jesus, shit. Something I've always had, I just didn't want to use it. - Not more hippie shit, Paul. - No, no, no. This isn't hippie shit. This is business. Look, I go to London looking for a few thousand dollars, but those assholes wouldn't give it to me. But I'm worth millions, right? I'm John Paul Getty III. Hundreds of millions. I'm gold. So? So... you all knew. You were all cashing in. So now I cash in. ♪ All that you touch and all that you see ♪ But what are you cashing in? ♪ All that you taste ♪ ♪ All you feel ♪ Me. ♪ And all that you love ♪ ♪ And all that you hate ♪ ♪ All you distrust ♪ "They will kill me unless you pay..." ♪ And all that you give... ♪ How much? What am I worth? $500 million, hmm? No, that's... No, they'd have to sell most of Getty Oil for that. We need quick money. No, we don't want that much. Just enough for Bertolini and enough for us to live in Morocco. - Hmm. - $100 million? ♪ And all that you eat... ♪ I'm just gonna leave it up to Bertolini. "They will kill me unless you pay what... "they... ask. "I love you. Paul." "Cara Mama, since Thursday, "I've been in the hands of kidnappers. "You will have received a telephone call by now. "It is real. "Do not tell the police because my life is involved. "They will kill me unless you pay what they ask. I love you. Paul." I don't trust Bertolini. Or any of them. What else are we gonna do? It'll be a week, two at most, and then we're free, finally. We're out of here. I guess. Martine... ...will you marry me? What? When this is over, when I'm back. You can't, Paul. If you marry before you're 26, they'll, they'll disinherit you, right? We won't need their money after this. We'll never hear the word "Getty" again. I'll just be Paul, You'll just be Martine, we'll live in Morocco and have children. What about Jutta? What about us? Sweet Paul. Will you? Will you marry me? - Yes. - Yeah? Yes, I will. Ciao. You're going? Now? Yeah. Let's get this over with. The sooner I'm gone, the sooner I'm back. I love you, Martine. Hey, hey, hey. Welcome. So this is it, huh? Mm-hmm. Where... where's the bathroom? Ugh. You want me to shit in a bucket? You want a hotel? You've been kidnapped. - Yeah, but... - This is five star. Most kidnap victims get beaten, starved, tied to the wall, sometimes killed. So shut up. No... no! You stay in here, in this room. Away from the window. Or-or-or we tie you like a dog. You and me, we agree you have disappeared. - Yeah. - So you disappear. Understand? All right, all right. Good day for the beach, huh? Hey. All right, but I need to shit, so... - La porta resta aperta. - Resta aperta. Yes. I get it. - Bravo. - Right. What? ♪ Wow! ♪ ♪ Wow! ♪ Ah. Yes.

I'd take my brothers and sisters up to the top of the roof, and we'd make a boat from the table. We'd all get in... cast off and sail away to a tropical island. We'd get coconuts from the trees, swim in the ocean, and... there was a talking parrot. Parrot? Uh, pappagallo. Pappagallo parlando? Pappagallo. Uh-huh. Hey, switch the lights out, I'll show you.
