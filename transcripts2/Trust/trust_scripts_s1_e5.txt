 We have to go back. Quickly. I'm not going back. Listen, w-we'll say you got free, and I brought you back, okay? No, no, no, no, no! Hey! St-Stop! Fucking think! He's not an idiot. How did I get out? Who's got the key? Huh? You or me? Pri-Primo. Primo.

 No, no, no! Primo! No! No! No, no, Primo! No! No, no, no! Ciao. Primo. - We need to get to a phone. - Shh. - There must be houses somewhere. - Shut up. What? No. No, no, no, no, no. What? The bells. So? What about the bells? Huh? Hey, hey. What's that about, the bells? Getting everybody. What? Everyone knows. Everywhere. About me? Yeah. And about me. Everyone knows... we get... we get rescued, right? No rescue. What are you looking for? That valley is where I lived with my nonna. My grandmother. You know what they do to people who betray? Me? They kill me. Easy. No problem. The family... they are... they are cut. Invisible. Nobody talks to them. Nobody gives them food in the market. They turn their face away. They spit. They are alone... until they die. And that will be my nonna. I'm sorry, I didn't know about your nonna. Yeah. You're just the golden hippie. You don't know anything. We have to get down there - before this afternoon. - Why? You got a plan? You know where we're going? All right, don't. Nothing in this country works. Nothing. I should never have let you do it. $600... plus expenses. If they play their cards right, "plus expenses" can be highly lucrative. I made that very clear to them. Expenses... for a Getty? If I were a kidnapper, I'd be insulted. I don't know why I get talked into things. Every time. You... Paul, Lang. Let the men deal with it, we'll sort it out. And this is what happens. It's an opening offer in a negotiation. They're considering their position. They'll get back to us in their own... Italian time. - Except they haven't. - Yet. They didn't take Little Paul for his good company. They took him 'cause they want his granddad's money. They'll be in touch. Logically, it just makes sense. You think life's logical, Chace? Well, if there's money on the table, more often than not. Don't you? No. Um... Oh, man, I'm starving. Uh, how do you call this? Black... Blackberries? Yeah, blackberries. They're not ripe. Hey, where'd you learn English? School. Yeah, but it's-it's good. You know, the others, they didn't speak a word. You know the clever kid in the class? Was me. I got sent to... to Napoli. Yeah. Very fucking clever. Come on, run. Here, here. - Why? - We lose the scent. - We should run. - Shh. They've lost our scent. It's okay. Go that way. Trust me. Go that way. Come on. Take my hand! Take my hand! I thought... I thought I was dead. Where I go, you go, right? Yeah. We got out! We really did it. Oh! You're a genius, man. You're a genius. It looks bad, man. I will be okay. Let's just get to Napoli. We'll be safe in the city. - Get you to a doctor. - No, too much... family in Napoli. I have to go to Rome and... disappear. What? No, no, no, no. You won't be safe there. You're gonna come to New York with me. - Me? In New York? - Yeah, you'll love it, man. I think you... you will not want to know me when you're with your famous friends. What are you talking about? You saved my life. No. - You saved my life. - Exactly. We're brothers now. I told you, man... where I go, you go. Angelo. What? Angelo. It's my name. Angelo. Angelo. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Angelo. You know what? Just a juicy green apple. Apple? That's it? - Yeah. - Crazy. Chicken and fries. Yes, yeah. Chicken... chicken cooked in lemon and rosemary, like my nonna cooks. I will never see her again. Yeah, you will. We'll bring her to America. She can be our cook. - You think you can do that? - Uh-huh. Like a magic trick? The Gettys can pretty much do anything, man. Except pay for their son. Yeah, except that. Nothing on the ticker tape? Not about Paul. A five-pound check from a woman in Exeter. Another from a lady in Scotland; her pension for the week. And a 50-pence postal order from a... Nigel Stokes of Halifax. 50 pence? It's his pocket money, to help you with the ransom. I didn't say I couldn't pay it. I said I wouldn't. There's a difference. Nigel's eight. - Send it back. - Really? You never know when 50 pence might come in handy. Bullimore. Bullimore! Immediately, sir! Are you going deaf? Not to my knowledge, sir. Then why do I have to shout for you every time? Why won't they make a counteroffer? What's wrong with them? Huh? Primo. Che? Huh? Shit. Wake up. Are we still in Calabria? - Are we still... - Shh. We should go. Go. I need food and water. No. Not safe. I can't go any further. I just can't. I know. You know what? Do what you want. I'm gonna go find a house. I'm gonna find a house, some water, a phone. That's what I'm gonna do. Hey... you want to kill us?! Hey! Here, here, here, here, here. - You all right? - Yeah. Come on. It's okay, let's go. Let's keep on going. Where is everybody? Come on. Come on. No, no, no. Come on, Mom. Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. - They're here. - It's ringing. - It's ringing. - They're here! Hello? Hello? Paul? Paul? Paul, is that you? Paul, it's Mom. Paul, speak to me. Are you okay? Paul. Paul. Who is this? Si, Paul. - Hey. - Hi. Uh... Eh? Uh... What? Hey. We should go. No, no, no. I call my mom and then we're out of here. They'll send a fucking army for us, okay? He's helping us, I know it. - Luigi. - Hey. Ah. Mm. It's not... it's not working. She thinks it was the storm. Uh... - Paolo? - Yeah. We should go. Eh? Ooh. There hasn't been a storm. Grazie. Oh, no. Grazie. She says... she says, uh, he-he's gonna drive us to the main road, and then-then we can hitch to Napoli, no problem. What, now? Oh... okay. This is so good. Yeah, my nonna... she can cook capra alla bovese, frittole, caponata. People here, they have nothing, but they're just willing to give you everything. Then I'm going to live in a country where people have everything. It's gonna be great. A toast. - Yeah? To brothers. - Yes. Yes. Oh, no, no, no. We need more brandy. - Rosario! - Rosaria! Rosaria! That's all, folks. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait...! No! Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com
