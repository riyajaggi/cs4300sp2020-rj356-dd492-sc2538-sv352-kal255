BUT I REMEMBER PICKING UP MY FATHER'S GUITAR AND I WOULD PLAY IT I WOULD HEAR THOSE MAGIC MELODIES TELL ME THAT I WASN'T ALONE. AND IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE JUST FOR A MOMENT, I WOULD BE ALL RIGHT. AND I STARTED DRINKING JUST LIKE MY DAD I JUST WOULD BLOW ANY OPPORTUNITY I HAD. AND ONCE I WOKE UP FROM THAT AFTER 24 YEARS, OH, MY GOD THE DAMAGE I HAD DONE TO EVERYONE IN MY LIFE. NOW I'M ABOUT TO BE 15 MONTHS OVER Simon: I THINK YOU'RE VERY INSPIRATIONAL, NOLAN THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT DRIVING AND DRIVING UNTIL YOU GET TO THE EDGE OF THE WORK. IT'S KIND OF LIKE MUSIC, YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO GO WITH IT OUT WHERE THE WORLD SLOWS DOWN AND TIME STANDS STILL. YOU'RE IN CONTROL OF WHERE YOU END UP IN YOUR LIFE.

SO I AM LIKE, "OK, LET ME DEFUSE THE SITUATION, LET ME SHOW MY FRIEND THAT I RECOGNIZE HIM" SO I GIVE MY FRIEND ONE OF THESE:(GESTURES A THUMBS UP) BUT THIS LOOKS LESS LIKE AN "I KNOW YOU" AND MORE LIKE "THE PLAN IS A GO." HE WAS LIKE, USAMA I WAS LIKE, COMMENCE OPERATION I GET THROUGH THE GATE, BUT NOW I'M LATE, SO I'M RUNNING IN THE AIRPORT, BUT I'M RUNNING WITH A MASSIVE JACKET AND A HUGE BACKPACK DO Y'ALL REALIZE HOW BAD A BROWN DUDE LOOKS RUNNING IN AN AIRPORT WITH A HUGE BACKPACK I LOOKED LIKE A SUICIDE BOMBER WHO OVERSLEPT.

YOU KNOW THEM AS THE W.A.F.F.L.E. CREW. GROWING UP IN NEW YORK CITY WAS TOUGH, GANG VIOLENCE, STREET VIOLENCE, POVERTY. THERE'S NOT MUCH HELP. WALKING INTO "AGT" OUR FIRST TIME, WE WERE NERVOUS BUT MORE READY THAN ANYTHING. I WANT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE HEAD START WHEN WE GOT THE GOLDEN BUZZER FROM SIMON COWELL, THAT MEANT THE WORLD TO US.

THEN NEW YORK CITY WAS HIT HARD WE HAD THE MOST CASES OF COVID‐19 AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS WHOLE GLOBAL SHUTDOWN, OUR COUNTRY DIVIDED. WE JUST FELT LIKE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION WAS ALL AROUND US.

THAT WAS NEVER MORE TRUE THAN FOR THIS NEXT PERFORMER. IT GOES TO THE CORE OF WHO HE IS AND WHAT SHAPES HIS DREAM. HE IS MALIK DOPE I WAS BORN WITH MUSIC BUPUMPE INTO MY FACE AS A KID I WOULD PLAY WITH ANYTHING I COULD FIND. MY DAD WOULD ENCOURAGE ME AND START JAMMING WITH ME, DANCING OR PLAYING ALONG WITH ME I DEFINITELY LOOKED UP TO MY DAD. HE ALWAYS HAD THAT NATURAL RHYTHM, HE GAVE IT TO ME AS WELL WHEN I WAS A TEEN, MY DAD WAS IN A VERY CRITICAL, CRITICAL CAR ACCIDENT AT THE TIME THE DOCTORS DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IF HE WAS GOING TO SURVIVE OR NOT MY DAD HAS NEVER FULLY RECOVERED. AND NOW TODAY WE FOUND THE NEWS THAT FROM THE ACCIDENT IN THE PAST, HE'S NOW SUFFERING COMPLICATIONS WHICH IS LEAVING HIM PUSHING OUT HIS LAST DAYS. ANY DAY NOW, HE COULD BE GONE. THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS, MUSIC HAS BEEN A LIFESAVER, LITERALLY, MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY, SPIRITUALLY, EVERYTHING. EVEN IN THE DARKEST OF TIMES, MUSIC IS THE THING THAT BRINGS ME THE LIGHT WHEN I'M DRUMMING, IT'S LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD JUST STOPS THIS COULD BE THE LAST MOMENT THAT MY FATHER ACTUALLY GETS TO SEE ME PERFORM ALL I'M TRYING TO DO IS MAKE HIM PROUD WHILE I'M ON "AGT. BEFORE HE GOES, I WANT HIM TO SEE HIS SON PURSUING HIS DREAM SUPER HARD SO DAD, IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW, I LOVE YOU, I'M TURNING UP FOR YOU, AND I'M GOING TO BRING THAT FIRE [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE Terry: MALIK DOPE IN FRONT OF THE CLASSIC MONSTER MURAL HERE AT UNIVERSAL THE JUDGES' VERDICTS ARE NEXT, RIGHT AFTER THIS BREAK Announcer: COMING UP.

BEYOND THAT, BEYOND THAT, YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT ‐‐ I'M A FATHER OF A SON ALSO AND YOU'RE A SON, YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF PASSION AND WANT TO DO GOOD FOR THEIR FATHER, MEANT SO MUCH AND MADE IT EVEN MORE EMOTIONAL. YOU'RE NOT A GUY WHO JUST DOES MUSIC, YOU BECOME THE MUSIC. YOU'RE DANCING, THE BODY MOVES, THE SHOWMANSHIP. YOU ARE THE MUSIC. THAT WAS SPECTACULAR AND TONIGHT HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE NIGHT OF THESE QUARTER‐FINALS SO FAR, AMERICA HAS TOUGH TIME. Terry: HEIDI. Heidi: TO ME IT FELT LIKE IT WAS LIKE A MUSICAL OBSTACLE COURSE, JUMPING AND LOOPING AND DOING THE SLO‐MO WITH THE STICKS IN THE MIDDLE, IT WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE THERE WAS NOT ONE MOMENT WHERE WE EVER HAD THE CHANCE TO EVEN GET BORED. IT WAS REALLY, REALLY COOL I LOVE YOUR ENTHUSIASM TOO THANK YOU SO MUCH Terry: MALIK, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WIN "AGT"? IF I WIN "AGT," WELL, FOR ONE, I MAKE MY FAMILY PROUD.

HE IS MAX MAJOR. YOU KNOW, THIS WAS MY VIEW FOR ALL MY YEARS OF COLLEGE. I WAS WORKING AS A BARTENDER WHILE I PURSUED A DEGREE IN BUSINESS AS A BARTENDER, YOU'RE A FLY ON THE WALL, ALMOST INVISIBLE I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HUMAN NATURE WHAT WE SEE AFFECTS HOW WE THINK. IF WE CAN BECOME SKILLED IN CONTROLLING HOW PEOPLE SEE THINGS, THEN WE CAN START TO PLAY WITH THEIR MIND IT'S ALL JUST A MATTER OF PERCEPTION OUR THOUGHTS ARE A COMBINATION OF OUR OWN IDEAS AND THE CHOICES THAT OTHER PEOPLE WANT US TO MAKE AFTER ALL, THE REASON THAT ADVERTISING WORKS IS BECAUSE EVERYONE THINKS IT DOESN'T WORK ON THEM. AFTER COLLEGE, I QUIT BARTENDING AND ATTEMPTED TO TURN MY SKILLS OF READING PEOPLE INTO A PROFESSION EVER SINCE TAKING THAT LEAP, I'VE BEEN TOTALLY FOCUSED ON HAVING MY OWN SHOW IN LAS VEGAS AND I CAN FINALLY FEEL THE PIECES COMING TOGETHER PERFORMING IS MY DREAM AND "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT" IS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT'S GOING TO GET ME THERE TONIGHT AS I PERFORM IN THE LIVE ROUND, I NEED TO BE TOTALLY IN TUNE WITH THE JUDGES I'M SWINGING FOR THE FENCES WITH THIS ACT AND I HOPE I CAN PULL IT OFF TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT I MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE THANK YOU.

GOOD EVENING HELLO. SO GLAD YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THE SHOW THIS WAY. NOW, SINCE YOU CAN'T BE HERE WITH US IN PERSON, I'M GOING TO TRY AND GET INSIDE YOUR MIND THROUGH THE SCREEN EACH OF YOU SHOULD HAVE A PAD OF PAPER AND A MARKER CAN YOU HOLD UP A CLEAN SHEET SO I CAN SEE YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN. GOOD YOU CAN HOLD THAT COMFORTABLY IN YOUR LAP FOR NOW IN A MOMENT, I'M GOING TO ASK EACH OF YOU TO DRAW A PICTURE, BUT BEFORE YOU DO I WANT YOU TO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND FOCUS ON YOUR IMAGE SEE IT IN YOUR MIND. NOW OPEN YOUR EYES AND DRAW THE IMAGE YOU'VE BEEN THINKING OF. DON'T LET ANYONE ELSE SEE IT AND WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED, HOLD IT TO YOU. HOWIE, IN ADDITION TO CONNECTING WITH OUR VIRTUAL AUDIENCE I'D LIKE TO TRY AND CONNECT WITH YOU ARE YOU UP FOR IT? Howie: I'M READY.

IT ALL STARTS TOMORROW AT 8:00/7:00 CENTRAL. BE HERE. OKAY, THIS NEXT ACT TAKES BEING A CONTORTIONIST TO THE NEXT LEVEL. ACTUALLY, NOT TO THE NEXT LEVEL, THIS GOES WAY BEYOND THAT! AND THIS ACT ISN'T ONE CONTORTIONIST, THERE'S THREE OF THEM HERE'S BONE‐BREAKERS WHERE WE COME FROM, A DREAM IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES AT NIGHT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN REALITY WE'RE 6,665 MILES AWAY FROM HOLLYWOOD, THE CITY OF GUINEA IN AFRICA, ONE OF THE POOREST CITIES IN AFRICA OVER 12 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN OUR CITY AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM LIVE IN POVERTY. THERE ARE NO STARS THAT LINE OUR SIDEWALKS. PEOPLE TOLD US THAT PERFORMING IS NOT A WAY TO MAKE A LIVING. TO FIND A JOB IS A DREAM PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE IS A DREAM. TO GO TO SCHOOL IS A DREAM. BEING ON "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT" WAS THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM. AND NOW THE DREAM HAS COME TRUE. AMAZING WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING GREAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN WE FOUND WE HAD A UNIQUE TALENT AND PEOPLE LAUGHED AT US. THAT TALENT HAS BROUGHT US TO AMERICA, THE BIGGEST STAGE IN THE WORLD. NOW WE TRULY FEEL THAT WE CAN WORK HARD AND GIVE A BETTER LIFE TO OUR FAMILIES BACK HOME.

THANK YOU SO MUCH Heidi: I LOVED IT VERY GOOD. >> Terry: HOWIE. Howie: I'M GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU YOU GUYS ARE NOW MY FAVORITE ACT OF THE NIGHT NO, I'M JUST SAYING, I'M SEEING SUCH ORIGINALITY IT WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH, THINGS SHOULDN'T BE GOING IN THAT DIRECTION. FRIENDS DON'T FOLD OTHER FRIENDS. IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE A WISH, AND THE WISH WAS, I HOPE THIS DOESN'T BREAK MY BONES. YOU GUYS ARE GREAT AMERICA, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A DECISION Terry: SOFIA. Sofia: IT'S KIND OF EXHAUSTING FOR ME TO WATCH YOU GUYS AT THE SAME TIME I WANT TO SEE AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE.

WELL, NOW HE'S CHANGING THAT AND HE'S STEPPING RIGHT INTO THE SPOTLIGHT. HE'S SHELDON RILEY GROWING UP, FITTING IN WAS NEVER AN OPTION FOR ME I'M FROM A FAMILY OF PUBLIC HOUSING, SO WE WERE ALWAYS MOVING AROUND. I WENT TO SO MANY SCHOOLS AS A KID. NOT HAVING A BEST FRIEND OR EVEN JUST A FRIEND BECAME NORMAL. I KNOW THAT EVERYONE HAS EXPERIENCED BULLYING FOR ME, IT WAS TOUGH PHYSICAL STUFF, AND VERBAL STUFF. BEING A KID, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FEELINGS OF WHO AM I AND WHAT AM I GOING TO BECOME. I WAS GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF HOW CAN I HIDE EVEN MORE I NEVER WANTED TO BE ME BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE ANYTHING SO I JUST DECIDED TO HIDE MYSELF AWAY BUT IT'S SO PAINFUL AND LONELY TO BE SEPARATE FROM THE WORLD. I CAME ON THE "AGT" BECAUSE I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. EITHER I COME OUT OR I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN LIVE THIS LIFE ANYMORE. Simon: PEOPLE KIND OF SECOND‐GUESS WHAT WE LIKE OR DON'T LIKE IT'S ORIGINALITY RATHER THAN PREDICTABILITY IT'S WELL DESERVED THANK YOU SO MUCH IT MADE ME REALIZE THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DON'T ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT FITTING IN AND IT'S OKAY TO BE EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE. I WAS THAT 10‐YEAR‐OLD BOY WHO READ FASHION MAGAZINES IN THE DARK AND COVERED HIS BRUISES WITH HIS MOM'S MAKEUP. NOW I WEAR MAKEUP TO EXPRESS MYSELF MY MUSIC AND MY FASHION ARE AN EXTENSION OF MYSELF. TO REVIEW EVERYTHING THAT IS ME. "AGT" COULD DEFINITELY CHANGE MY LIFE BECAUSE IT ALREADY HAS. IT'S GIVEN ME SO MUCH CONFIDENCE, JUST BEING MYSELF. I DO FEEL LIKE I'VE HIDDEN MY WHOLE LIFE AND NOW IS THE TIME TO STOP HIDING [ APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪ I JUST CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF M HEAD ♪ ♪ YOUR LOVING IS ALL I THINK ABOUT ♪ ♪ I JUST CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF M HEAD ♪ ♪ IT'S MORE THAN I DARE TO THIN ABOUT ♪ ♪ LA LA LA ♪ ♪ LA LA LA LA LA ♪ ♪ LA LA LA ♪ ♪ LA LA LA LA LA ♪ ♪ I JUST CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF M HEAD ♪ ♪ CAUSE YOUR LOVING IS ALL I THINK ABOUT ♪ ♪ I JUST CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF M HEAD ♪ ♪ BUT IT'S MORE THAN I DARE TO THINK ABOUT ♪ ♪ EVERY NIGHT, EVERY DAY ♪ ♪ JUST TO BE THERE IN YOUR ARMS ♪ ♪ WON'T YOU STAY ♪ ♪ WON'T YOU STAY ♪ ♪ FOREVER AND EVER ♪ ♪ AND EVER AND EVER ♪ ♪ I JUST CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF M HEAD ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE Terry: SHELDON RILEY. SOFIA. Sofia: I MEAN, THIS IS VERY EMOTIONAL. THE WAY THAT YOU PERFORMED AND I THINK IT'S SO UNIQUE, THIS THING THAT YOU HAVE CREATED, THE COSTUMES AND EVERYTHING, THE MAGIC, THE MYSTERY, TO HIDE YOURSELF, I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC WHAT YOU HAVE CREATED. I LOVE IT, I LOVE THE SONG AND I HOPE THAT PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND THAT THEY VOTE FOR YOU BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS IN THIS COMPETITION I CAN'T WAIT Terry: HOWIE. Howie: I AGREE WITH YOU YOU KNOW, I AGREE WITH WHAT SOFIA SAID YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WE ALL ARE TRYING TO FIND A PATH WHERE WE CAN FIT IN AND WE WANT TO BE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I THINK WITH YOUR STYLE AND TALENT AND FASHION, YOU'RE NOT LIKE ANYONE ELSE, YOU'RE ORIGINAL THAT GIVES US ALL POWER. IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH THAT AMERICA VOTES FOR YOU, YOU NEVER REALLY REVEAL WHO YOU TRULY ARE. THIS IS ANY ONE OF US. YOU'RE A LEADER, YOU REALLY ARE. Terry: HEIDI. Heidi: WELL, I'M JUST REALLY HAPPY THAT YOU FINALLY FOUND YOURSELF AND THAT YOU'RE CONFIDENT. I THINK YOU'RE REALLY COOL I ALSO LOVE THE MYSTERY OF IT ALL. YOU ARE QUITE BEAUTIFUL BEHIND THAT, I HAVE TO SAY, THE GLIMPSES WE SEE HERE AND THERE MY FAVORITE IS WHEN YOU BELT IT OUT AT THE END, BECAUSE YOU HAVE A POWERFUL VOICE AND YOU CAN GO THERE. I LOVED IT IT WAS VERY UNIQUE [ APPLAUSE ] Terry: NOW, SHELDON WHAT IS YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL AS A PERFORMER? I'M VERY PROUD TO BE ON THE STAGE AND TO MEET YOU, HEIDI KLUM, OH, MY GOSH, MY HEART IS RACING I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU QUICKLY. AS A LITTLE BOY I USED TO SNEAK AROUND AND WATCH YOU IN MY LAUNDRY ROOM AND WATCH FASHION I'M JUST SO GRATEFUL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING SOMEONE LIKE ME FROM THE LGBT COMMUNITY A VOICE TO EXPRESS MY FASHION AND UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT SO AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. BUT MY GOAL, AGAIN, HEIDI, I LIVE BY WHAT YOU SAY AND WHAT YOU SAID WAS, IN FASHION AND IN EVERYTHING, ONE DAY YOU'RE IN AND THE NEXT DAY YOU CAN BE OUT. I WANT TO LIVE BY THAT BECAUSE UNTIL MY TIME'S UP, I'M GOING TO LIVE EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE AUTHENTICALLY AND ORIGINALLY AND NOT PREDICTABLE. SOFIA, I MIGHT BE HIDDEN RIGHT NOW BUT I'M NOT HIDING THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TELL PEOPLE IN AMERICA AND THE WHOLE WORLD. Terry: THANK YOU, SHELDON, GOOD LUCK TONIGHT. COME ON, YOU'VE SEEN SOME GREAT ACTS TONIGHT, AND NOW YOU GET TO DECIDE WHO'S GOING TO INTO THE SEMIFINALS WITH YOUR VOTES AND REMEMBER, YOU CAN VOTE USING YOUR X FUNNY I AT THIS VOICE REMOTE COMING UP, WE'VE GOT A SENSATIONAL AERIALIST. HE'S HAD TO FIGHT HARD TO DO WHAT HE LOVES, AND TONIGHT HE'S PUSHING HIS SKILLS TO THE LIMI Terry: WE HAVE ALL COME OUT TO UNIVERSAL PLAZA FOR THIS NEXT ACT. HEY, SOFIA >> Heidi: HI, TERRY. Terry: HOWIE. Howie: HERE COMES THE JUDGE THIS GUY'S YOUNG KIDS HAD NEVER SEEN WHAT HE DOES UNTIL THE AUDITION THEN HIS YOUNG SON WAS JUMPING FOR JOY WHEN HE SAW HIS DAD PERFORM. HE IS A MAN WHO HAS HAD TO FIGHT HARD TO DO WHAT HE LOVES HE IS ALAN SILVA FROM ALL THE BULLIES, STONES BEING THROWN AT ME AS A KID, JUST BECAUSE I LOOK DIFFERENT. BUT WHEN I'M FLYING THROUGH THE AIR, I HAVE FREEDOM. I FEEL INVINCIBLE. FOR ONE MOMENT IN MY LIFE, I AM UP ABOVE AERIALISTS ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT UNDERNEATH ALL OF THAT BEAUTY THERE IS THE SENSE OF DANGER ONE DAY I WAS PERFORMING, DOING THIS FINAL MOVE, AND I FELL. NEXT THING I KNOW, I WAKE UP IN THE HOSPITAL THE DOCTOR SAID YOU BROKE YOUR NECK AND I'M NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM AGAIN IT WAS THE WORST TIME IN MY LIFE BECAUSE I FELT THAT I LOST IT ALL. IT TOOK ME A YEAR TO RECOVER IT WAS HARD PHYSICALLY IT WAS HARD MENTALLY AND I WAS AFRAID TO GET BACK IN THE SILK BUT WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN, YOU CAN LET IT HOLD YOU BACK OR YOU CAN CONQUER YOUR FEAR. SO FOR THIS PERFORMANCE I AM GOING TO DO THE MOVE THAT BROKE MY NECK. I KNOW THIS IS CRAZY BUT MY ENTIRE LIFE, I HAVE OVERCOME CHALLENGES. SO TONIGHT, I CAN'T LET FEAR STOP ME. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE Howie: WHAT'S GOING ON? IT'S NOT OVER?

MY FAMILY WASN'T A SUPPORTER OF MY PREGNANCY OR MY DREAMS. AND I FELT ALONE I WANTED TO GIVE UP AT TIMES, HONESTLY, BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE YOU'RE NOT JUST BATTLING SOMEBODY TELLING YOU YOU'RE WRONG FOR BELIEVING IN YOURSELF, BUT YOU'RE ALSO BATTLING WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.
