People in this room are talking about this moment. [cheers and applause] . [cheers and applause] This is the biggest crowd I have ever sang in front of in my life. These next 90 seconds could change my life tremendously. [gentle music] And it'd be different if it was just a room and, like, you know, just, like, the judges. Hello, hello. Oh, my God. I'm Terry Crews. How are you? I know you are. Oh. What's your name? I'm Benny. I'm Benicio Bryant. ♪ ♪ I'm Benecio Bryant, I'm 14 years old, and I'm a singer. Literally no one in my family has any musical background or ability. So I never in a million years, you know, thought that I would be here on "America's Got Talent." Are you excited to be performing for the huge crowd and the judges? Oh, my gosh, and I'm, like, kinda nervous. You know, you just get that, like, jitters of just like, "Ah, I can't believe I'm doing this." ♪ Country roads ♪ ♪ Oh take me home ♪ ♪ To the place ♪ ♪ Where I belong ♪ My issue is that was safe. Particularly a singer today, you've got to do something we haven't normally heard before. I've heard this a million times. [audience boos] I'm nervous about Simon just because I know that, you know, he will say anything. [laughs] She did amazing. Yeah. You know, it's-- [buzzer blares] When he decided he wanted to do "America's Got Talent," I was like, oh, my God, can I handle Simon if he's gonna be mean? Still think you're singing in the wrong key. [audience boos] Simon's, like, responsible for a lot of famous people's careers. He's a big deal, and what if he doesn't like me? ♪ ♪ My biggest dream is to just make my parents proud and perform for the world. Do you get to perform a lot? Yeah. [chuckles] Well, yeah, just, like, around, you know, local coffee shops and stuff like that. Well, this is way bigger than local. This is way bigger than some coffee shops. You are about to go out there right now. Go do your best, Benny. I'm with you, man. Thank you so much. Thank you, I appreciate that. High five. All right, have a good one. Thank you very much. All right, come on, Mom. [cheers and applause] Hi. Hi. What's your name? My name's Benicio Bryant. How old are you? I'm 14. Are you singing for us? Yeah, I'll be singing. And what got you into music? Uh, my dad I guess. When he was--like, he turned 40, he was like, "You know what, I think I'm gonna be a rock star." We were all, like, looking at him like, "Okay, yeah, sure." And so then, you know, I started taking lessons... He really did do that. I think he was having, like, a midlife crisis. But I've just been, you know, singing ever since I was, like, two. Amazing. Well, why did you come on "AGT"? I've been watching the show for so long. [chuckles] And I wanted to come here so that I could share my music with the world and, uh, I just-- I'm so excited.
