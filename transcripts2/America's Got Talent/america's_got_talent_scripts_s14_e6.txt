[cheers and applause] [rousing music] Just hearing that there's over 2,000 people just live over there is-- I'm really nervous. My name is Eric Chien. I'm 26 years old. And I'm a magician from Houston, Texas. Growing up, I liked watching magic shows on TV. It really did make me believe that there is magic out there in the world. [soft dramatic music] I told everyone that I'm going to be a magician. A lot of people doubted me, but that's all I wanted to do. So I just focused on my dream. Magic helped me get through tough times. After college, I was called back to Taiwan for military service. And my whole world was flipped upside-down. I couldn't bring any personal stuff. No cards, no coins, nothing. I could no longer do magic, and we couldn't do anything outside of military duties, and it felt like I just lost my identity. So when I came back out, I didn't have my confidence. And I kind of lost who I was and I tried to find myself again. So I have actually only started performing recently. And I'm still trying to learn how to deal with a big audience. ♪ ♪ I know last year's winner of "America's Got Talent" is Shin Lim, and that really puts the pressure on me. I'm following in the footsteps of one of the best in the world, and it's a whole nother level of nervousness. I can't stop shaking my hands. This is the biggest performance of my life, and I only have one shot of doing this. So I'm just gonna give it my all, and I really hope that they enjoy my act tonight. There you go, brother. All right. Make it happen! [cheers and applause] Hello. Take a deep breath. Take it all in. And tell me your name. My name is Eric Chien. And what do you do? I am a magician. Okay. You do that for a living? Uh, I've only started performing for the past six months. [crowd murmurs] Oh, wow. And here on "AGT," magic is king. Yes, I saw Shin Lim's act, but I think we're two very different people. And... Who's better? [crowd groans] [laughter] [sighs] Yeah. You know what? Good luck. [cheers and applause] Go ahead. Go ahead. He's so nervous. Yeah. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] Wow! ♪ ♪ [crowd exclaims] Look, it turns blue! [cheers and applause] What? Oh! Whoa!

Well, I started playing the violin when I was 7 1/2. And what made you get into playing violin? I wanted to start playing the violin because I was being bullied in school. Aww. Oh, man. Do you know why you were being bullied? It's because I had cancer. I almost died. [audience awws] [somber music] ♪ ♪ My name is Tyler Butler-Figueroa, and I'm from North Carolina. I was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 4 1/2. Leukemia is a cancer in the blood. One day we were out to dinner, and we said, "Something doesn't look right with Tyler." He turned kind of pale. So a mother's instinct said, let me get him to the emergency room. They was like, "Let's take some blood work and we'll be back." The doctors came in, said, yeah, he does have cancer. [sniffles] And, uh... ♪ ♪ It was the worst day of my life. The doctors treated me with chemotherapy. When I lost my hair, I was really sad and embarrassed at the same time to go to school. They used to make fun of me and laugh at me, because I was different. They would spread rumors to say that my cancer was contagious and they all wanted to stay away from me. One day, Tyler saw a flyer at his school, and it said, "After school program. Free violin lessons." He was like, "Mom, I wanna do it, mom, I wanna do it." I was like, "But no one in our family plays an instrument. What--and the violin?" I would just practice in my bedroom, and the more I did it, the better I got. Once he started that class, it was like a sunshine. He was just full of energy, happy, and I was like, "Oh, my God, I got my son back." When I play the violin, it helps me forget about all the bad stuff. I just didn't want to be the kid with cancer. So now I'm the kid who plays the violin. [cheers and applause] You got this.
