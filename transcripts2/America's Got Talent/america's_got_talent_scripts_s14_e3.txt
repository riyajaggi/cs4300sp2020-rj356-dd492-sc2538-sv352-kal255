 [cheers and applause] ♪ ♪ [cheers and applause] Thanks for dropping by. Listen, you know what, that L.A. traffic man. Had to fly on in here, you know what I'm saying? Once again, Terry, subtle. All right, guys, are you ready to get this show started? [wild cheering] Here we go! [cheers and applause] I wanted to do tandem with him. [classical music] Oh, this is crazy. All these people. Look at this. Oh, my God. I'm Marina. I'm 21 years old. I live in Los Angeles, California, and I'm a dancer. I grew up in a small town in Ukraine. Growing up, I have an older brother, and I always wanted to do everything he could do, like climbing the trees, fishing. So I definitely was like tomboy. [chuckles] My mom wanted for me to be more girly, like a lady, so she signed me up for ballet classes. When I started to dance, I fell in love with the music, with the movements. It just came naturally. I would have never dreamed that I could be on the biggest stage in the world, and now I'm here. [cheers and applause] Hello. Hi. What's your name? My name is Marina. And I'm guessing you're a dancer. Yes, I am a dancer. And, Marina, how old are you? I'm 21. Okay, why have you decided to come on the show this year? When I moved to L.A., I wanted my dreams will come true and to be seen on this show, and you're those people who can realize it. [cheers and applause] I get it. And what's the ultimate dream, Marina? I want to perform. I want to become an artist. Okay. Well, the stage is yours. [cheers and applause] I'm so excited. I love dancing.

[uplifting music] For anyone who says they don't believe in magic, hello. ♪ ♪ It is a great day to be alive! ♪ ♪ Shin Lim! [cheers and applause] I'm Dom, I'm 26, and I'm a magician. When I was six years old, my granddad wanted to find a way to relate to his grandkids, something to bond with us, and magic was what he chose, and that's where my obsession with magic began. I loved it and decided I'm gonna be a magician. But as I grew older, I realized working as a magician, it's not always the most glamorous job. I've done shows where no one has watched. I've done shows in the pouring rain. I have endless horror stories, and it got a point where I questioned if magic was the thing that I really wanted to do. ♪ ♪ Then last year, my granddad passed away. It made me think about those amazing times I had when I was a kid, and it reminded me why I love magic. So I decided to continue to legacy that he created. ♪ ♪ "America's Got Talent" is every magician's dream. [crowd boos, buzzer] But I'm a little nervous. This is the biggest stage in the world, and I think that you've missed the mark. We've seen some incredible magicians on this show, and now they're headlining shows in Las Vegas. For me, this could be what changes everything, and I really hope it is. [cheers and applause] Hello. Hi. What's your name? My name is Dom Chambers. I am 26, and I'm from Australia. And what do you do in Australia? I do magic. Have you had, like, a really tough gig? I know as a comedian, I have. I was once hired to perform magic at a funeral. You can imagine how tense that was. It was like, "I'm so sorry for your loss. But is that your card? Is that the one?" It was... [laughter] What did you say when you got the booking? I said, "How much?" [laughter] So why "America's Got Talent"? Well, this is the biggest stage in the world, and I don't want to be doing those shows anymore. This is where I want to be. [cheers and applause] All right, well, good luck. Go ahead. Okay. [mellow rock music] Folks, if you would like to see the appearing glass of beer, say yes. all: Yes! All right. ♪ ♪ One empty... paper bag. One dramatic magic gesture. ♪ ♪ One beer... coaster. [music stops, tepid applause] But that's not it. This is the appearing glass of beer trick! [cheers and applause] ♪ ♪ Now, they say a good magician would never repeat the same trick twice. Well, lucky for you, I'm not a very good magician. [laughter] All right. Here's one for the non-beer drinkers. Bottle of wine in the bag. ♪ ♪ Wah! A tiny bottle! Please, bang! Wine! What? Whoa! [laughs] Come on, here we go! They say don't worry, in case of an emergency always bring a spare coaster. But where there's a coaster, there's a beer. Not there. [gasps] What? [cheers and applause] All right, now we're warming up. Nothing in the sleeves except for the coaster. Uh, but other than that, absolutely nothing to hide. No hidden glasses, no hidden beers. Except for that one. [laughter] Here we go, America. Bag, coaster. Beer. Yes! And another, come on! [laughs] All right, here we go. No jackets, no sleeves, no shoe. What the heck? That's my shoe.

I just have to tell you though, when you first started, I could tell you were a little nervous, but then you absolutely crushed it. Ah. I thought that was so fun. Thanks so much, Julianne. Gabrielle? You were like a cold beer for me, super refreshing. [laughter] Great job. Thanks so much. Simon. You have got such an amazing personality. You're very much of the YouTube generation. I thought that was an amazing audition. Absolutely. Thank you so much. There was one issue, it's drinking out of your shoe, but that's just a personal thing. But all kidding aside, "AGT" is the house of magic, if you come with the full package. I love it. [cheers and applause] Let's vote. Gabrielle? Hell yes for me. Julianne. You got mine. That's two yeses. Simon? You I'm gonna remember, It's three yeses. You have four yeses! Thank you so much. Cheers, thank you. You want one? I would. I'll take one. Yeah, bring 'em all. Out of his shoe? Bring 'em all. Oh, he drank the one from the shoe. [cheers and applause] Love the way you dress as well. Thank you so much. Yeah, you've got so much going on.

[cheers and applause] What is your name? My name is Carmen Carter. [cheers and applause] And how old are you? I just turned 55. Whoo! You look amazing! You look amazing. Thank you. And what do you do for a living? I'm a full-time singer. So mostly, like, background singing? Is that what you do for a living? Yes, I'm a background singer. You hear my voice, but you never know my name. This is like that documentary about backup singers. both: "Twenty Feet From Stardom." So why haven't you had the break so far? When--[sighs] [exhales] So when I first started in the music industry, someone wrote music for me, and they had a company fly someone out to hear me sing. He told the person that wrote the music for me, "She's wonderful, but she's too fat." [audience oohs] So... [crowd booing] I kinda just went in the background after that. [somber music] [humming] Singing is who I am. It's something I do, but it is who I am. You feeling it? How you feel? It's been a long time coming. But it was a struggle becoming a singer. When the record exec told me that I was too fat to be a lead singer, it really deflated me. In that moment, my biggest dream was done, and it killed my confidence. But I still needed to work. So I asked a friend if she had any extra work for me singing background, and from that moment, unfortunately, that's where I've been all my life. Over the years, I stayed busy singing. I had two beautiful children, and I'm so grateful that my singing could provide for my family. But it's always been that "what if?" After years of my family hearing me talk about it, they're like, "Go for it." They've been telling me to come on the show for years. Nervous? Don't be nervous. I'm nervous. I feel a little bit-- It's a lot of people. Yeah. It doesn't matter what size you are, what color, what shape, where you're from, you still can go after your dream. Here I am, 55 years old. This is it. This is the last hoorah. I'm gonna show everybody what I can do, and I'm excited. [cheers and applause] You're standing on that star, and now we're about to see stardom happen.

Madison, Wisconsin. Okay. How old are you? Uh, 49. And what do you do? Um... I'm unemployed. I'm trying to be a comedian. Oh, really, and what made you decide comedy? Um... Um, there was a comedy club that was right down the street, and I was looking for an excuse to get out of my house. [laughter] [gentle music] I would say that so far fear has sort of ruled my life. Comedy has been a way of trying to take back control. When I was little, my parents noticed that I had severe anxiety. My family moved around a lot, which I think made everything worse, 'cause I was always the new kid, and I was this dorky, unathletic nerd. One time my classmates spent a week not talking to me, pretending I was invisible. ♪ ♪ After college, my anxiety got even worse, and I stopped leaving my house altogether. I was diagnosed with agoraphobia. I was just terrified of leaving my house. Month after month and then year after year, it just went on and on and on. And there's a day-to-day awareness that life is slipping by. ♪ ♪ Many years later, my psychiatrist gave me tasks, like go outside. Then it was stay outside for five minutes. Each step was painful, but eventually I could walk around the block. I've always been interested in comedy. There was a comedy club three blocks away. My psychiatrist made me go there and write jokes. Then he said, "We need to get you up on that stage." It seemed impossible. I went up, I was just so scared. People said, "I could see how scared you were, but you made it," which mean the world to me. ♪ ♪ Since then I've gone to open mics and small things like that, but going on the "America's Got Talent" stage is a huge opportunity to reach out to the world. It's still with me, this fear, but instead of just watching other people live, I want to live. [cheers and applause] All right, I don't want to make you more nervous than you already are, so good luck. Okay. Thank you. [cheers and applause] Just back up a little bit. You can stand right there. Let me tell you about the first time I blacked out. And that's all I remember. [faint laughter] I don't always cry myself to sleep. I have insomnia. [laughter and applause] Today I saw twin pandas. That bears repeating. [laughter] I used to have a problem with grammatical tenses. But not yet. [laughter] "Just married" makes it sound like they're already disappointed.

[cheers and applause] And how old are you? I'm 31. 31. Tell me the song you're gonna sing and why you've chosen it. So tonight I'm gonna sing "Nothing Compares 2 U" by Prince, and I chose--yeah. [cheers and applause] To me, that song completely explains the meaning of true love. When you find love, if you're fortunate to find love, and I have-- Oh. When? Actually, I just celebrated a year of marriage in August. Oh, wow. So yeah. She here? She's here tonight, yes. What's her name? Denise. [gentle music] I'm McKenzie, I'm 31 years old, and I'm a singer. I grew up on a farm, and it's a known fact, if you play music for certain animals, they'll corral around and listen. So we would go out into the fields, and we would put on a show, and they would crowd around, about 150 to 200 cows. College wasn't really on my radar, but then I found out about a school of music. So I flew up to Boston, I auditioned, and I got in. Unfortunately, I was only able to complete two semesters of the school because I couldn't afford it anymore. I was extremely depressed, but my time there in Boston was really transformative in that I met my wife there. She was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen, and it's a nice thing to know that I don't have to do life by myself. I mean, I always dreamed that I could be a musician, but I had to get a regular nine to five job, and when you know that you're supposed to be doing something else, it can get hard. But my wife doesn't really let me get down. She believes in me when I don't believe in myself. She's the force that pushes me, and I absolutely wouldn't be where I'm at today without her in my life. I love you. I love you too. "America's Got Talent" is a massive opportunity, so this is my chance tonight to show the world what I've got, and this could possibly change everything for us. [cheers and applause] What was the last thing Denise said to you before she left you for you to come onstage? She told me that I was a star and to shine bright. Right. Whoo!

[energetic music] I'm Michael Paul, I'm a bird trainer, and I specialize in birds of prey. The bird I brought today is a very special bird. What makes it beautiful is also what makes it very dangerous. The beak, the claws, the wingspan. He's quite smart, and we have a particular bond that allows me to go outside certain comfort zones to dry different things. [bird squawks] Ow. But the other side to that is I haven't really had him in this kind of environment. Oh. [chuckles] She smells the bird in there. Do you smell Willie in there? [bird squawks, wings flap] [dog whimpers] Working with birds of prey, there are a lot of risks. Many injuries are possible and have happened. When I take off the cloth on the cage, how will the animal respond to the lights and the moving cameras and the crew? Even with training, it is not hard to trigger a bird of prey. [cheers and applause] [wings flapping, bird squawks] Shh, shh. If they're feeling like they're in danger, they might want to attack. [cheers and applause] I have two goals tonight.
