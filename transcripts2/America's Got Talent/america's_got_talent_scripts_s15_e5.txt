What's your name? ‐ Ty. ‐ How are you, sir? ‐ Man, I like them shoes, bro. ‐ Oh, got that whole thing going on. ‐ Okay, I gotta get my money up. ‐ Hey, it took about 20 years for this outfit. ‐ Ah, yes, yes. ‐ What are you coming here on "AGT" to do, Ty? ‐ I'm coming to tell some jokes. I know that sounds very simplistic, but it really is a big deal for me because when I became a dad, whatever I did after that had to have some stability. ‐ Right. ‐ That's when I got into pharmacy, because I knew I needed a job that made money. ‐ Right, you gotta take care of that family. ‐ Yeah, now that my kids are older, comedy's a thing that I said, "You know what? Let me take a chance and try it." But, you know, even my mom was like‐‐ I remember when I told her I was quitting the job to do pharmacy, she was like, "Okay." ‐ ‐ "Okay." ‐ ♪ You can count on me like one, two, three ♪ ‐ I always wanted to prove that I could do both: Be a great dad and be a great comedian. ‐ Thank you, bro. ‐ I feel like you're gonna do amazing for them. ‐ How you doing? ‐ What's your name? ‐ Ty Barnett. ‐ And where are you from, Ty? ‐ Chicago. South Side. ‐ And how old are you? ‐ Oh, I'm in my 40s. ‐ You look good. ‐ You look great. ‐ What do you do for a living? ‐ This is it. I do stand‐up, I'm a dad, I have three daughters. I have two biological and one daughter‐in‐law, so yeah. ‐ Oh, wow. ‐ Aww. ‐ So how long have you been doing stand‐up? ‐ About 18 years. ‐ 18 years? ‐ 18 years. ‐ So you were already 30. That's kind of late for a comic. ‐ I started after I got out of the military. I was in the Army for a while, yeah. ‐ Well, thank you for your service. Was it always a dream to be a comedian? ‐ You know what, ever since I first saw Richard Pryor. Like, I remember when I worked at a hospital, it was always a thing that I wanted to do. And what I loved about Pryor was that‐‐ you look at this audience, man, like, so many different people. I was like, "Man, look at how he's making all these different people laugh." ‐ He's my hero. ‐ Yeah, you know? ‐ Good for you. ‐ Well, show us your stuff. ‐ Oh, okay. Here we go. First of all, thank you guys for having me here. I love seeing all the talent back here. So young, it's awesome, which actually kind of makes me feel a little bit old. Like, I'm a man, but I'm a specific type of man, and that's the beauty of getting older. Like, example. Ladies, I'm the type of guy that if we go out for the evening and somebody disrespects you, I will defend your honor. But understand that the level of defense depends on the size‐‐ Of the offender. Like, in my heart, I wanna be like, "Yo, dude, what did you say?" But it might be like, "Yo, babe, what did you say?" I'm the type of guy, ladies, that will offer you my jacket. If it's cold outside, I will offer you my jacket. Um, but I'm not the type of guy that, once you turn that down, then you get cold later... Offer's off the table. You, uh‐‐ You obviously make bad decisions, and uh‐‐ We shouldn't both suffer for that. I just found out that I might need glasses. For reading, you know? So I had to make the hard decision, you know, to stop reading. I got colors and shapes down, I'm pretty good. I got silhouettes made out. I knew I was getting older, by the way, when I started rooting against the kids in scary movies. Remember how you watched "Friday the 13th," "Halloween"? Teenagers do something stupid or rebellious but you still want them to make it, you want them to live? You're like, "Run in the barn, he's coming! Run the barn!" Now I'm like, "Your mom and dad told you not to leave the house." "It's a school night. You're being disrespectful." "They in the barn, Jason. Go get 'em, they in the barn." "Spank 'em first. They was drinking, too." All right, thanks a lot, you guys. ‐ ‐ Bravo! Whoo‐whoo‐whoo! Bravo! ‐ Everybody likes him. ♪ ♪ ‐ Simon, what'd you think of him? ‐ I really, really felt his whole routine was just so funny, particularly the part about the kids in those movies. ‐ Yes. ‐ 'Cause every time I watch them, it's like, "Why are you going into the cellar?" ‐ Thank you. ‐ And so that, it's like you know you're gonna get slashed. And then you get to a point, like you, after a while, I don't really care if you do or not. So I kind of related to you in a big way, Ty. Very happy you chose to come on the show. ‐ Thanks for having me. I appreciate it. ‐ Yeah. ‐ Sofía? ‐ I really enjoyed your performance. I enjoy that Simon was laughing. He usually doesn't laugh that much at comedies. All your material was super relatable. I really liked it. ‐ Thank you very much. Thank you. ‐ You said you were inspired by Richard Pryor when you looked out into the audience and there was such a range of people and he was able to get everybody to relate and everybody to laugh. Not only this entire room, a guy from London, a woman from Colombia, and a grandpa from Canada. We all loved you. ‐ Thank you. ‐ We all loved you. ♪ ♪ I'm gonna start the voting with a yes. Sofía? ‐ Yes. ‐ Simon? ‐ You got three yeses, Ty. Well done. ‐ Three yeses! ‐ Thank you. ♪ We got love ♪ ‐ He seems like a nice guy, as well. ‐ Hey, hey, Ty. ‐ All right. Done. ‐ Ty, come here, man, come here, man. Just give me a hug, bro. ‐ So funny and light and fast. I loved it. ‐ You are a natural. ‐ I'm on my way to shoes like this. ‐ ‐ I'm on my way to shoes like this. ‐ Oh no, it's gonna be good! ‐ I'm gettin' it. ♪ You're all I need ♪ ‐ Okay, here we go. In five, four, three‐‐ ♪ ♪ ‐ Thank you. ♪ ♪ ‐ Wow. ‐ Hello. What's your name, please? ‐ I'm Forrest Knee. ‐ Okay. And where are you from? ‐ I'm from Newbury Park, California. ‐ Okay.

Howie, yes or no? ‐ I wanted to say something. I'm trying to remember. Um. What was I gonna say? No. ‐ Sofía? ‐ No, sorry. ‐ Okay, sorry, it's three nos. ‐ All right, cool. ‐ Sorry. ‐ ‐ Hi, I'm Terry. What's your name? ‐ Hi. How are you? Shaquira. ‐ Shaquira. ‐ Yes. ‐ And where are you from? ‐ I am actually from Kennesaw, Georgia. ‐ He looked so good, the‐‐the tuxedo, everything. ‐ Can't judge a book by its cover. ‐ Yeah. ‐ So what are you here to do? ‐ I'm here to sing. For the last probably 20‐plus years, I've been too insecure to go out there and show my talent and be myself, so this is my moment to kind of do that. ‐ All right, it's your time. ‐ Thank you. ‐ All right. ♪ ♪ ‐ What is your name? ‐ My name is Shaquira McGrath. ‐ And where are you from? ‐ I'm actually from Kennesaw, Georgia. It's a town about 20 minutes from Atlanta. ‐ And what do you do there? ‐ I am a server at the Atlanta Braves stadium. ‐ Oh, really? Wow. And what are you gonna be doing for us tonight? ‐ Tonight, I'll actually be singing for you, so no food being delivered. ‐ Have you ever sang in the stadium? ‐ All the time. I literally sing walking in the door, I sing to the tables when it's their birthdays, we'll have little concerts in the back in downtime. It's all we do. ‐ Really? And was that the dream, to‐‐ ‐ What, to sing in the back with the cooks? ‐ Just to sing. ‐ Absolutely. It's something that I've always wanted to do, but when I was younger, people would do that thing, like, "Oh, you sound so amazing, but, like, you could be a little thinner," or, "You could be a little taller." And so I never put myself out there like I should have, but it's been 25 years of being an idiot and just getting inside of your head. It's just too long. It's time. ‐ But Shaquira, you're not the idiot. It's the people who judge people, for all the things you've said, who are the idiots. ‐ Wait, people who judge people are idiots? ‐ No, no, no, no. Judge for the wrong reason are idiots. ‐ Oh, okay, okay. Good luck. ‐ Thank you. Come on, guys!

It was great. ‐ Thank you so much. ‐ Howie? ‐ You know, you've kept it bottled up inside.

It's my time. ‐ I need coffee, a lot of coffee. ‐ Sofía, I'm officially jealous of your job. ‐ I had a whole donut this morning. ‐ Is it weird that I find myself so attractive? ‐ Hello, good evening. What's your name? ‐ Chefboybonez. ‐ And where are you from, Chefboybonez? ‐ Sherman Oaks, California. ‐ What are you gonna be doing for us tonight? ‐ I'm a rapper. I rap. ‐ And what are you looking to do? Are you looking to get, like, a recording contract? ‐ I would be blessed with a recording contract. Form my own record label, do a tour, a real tour. ‐ Oh, wow. ‐ Yeah. My love of music began at the age of 13. There was a old hip‐hop art store and every last Sunday of the month, they would have these hip‐hop battles. I just fell in love my first time there and I was like, "This is what I want to do." My first rap battle, I was 14. They put me against the champ at that time. I got wrecked. So after that loss, I ended up practicing for a whole year. Writing lyrics, just getting better at my craft. And eventually, I ended up beating the guy who beat me. Since then, I've gone to win 12 emcee battles, and it got me some notoriety and success in the rap world. Thought the next step was meeting a record label to catapult my career. But unfortunately, it didn't do that. And so that's when the hustle began. I had to sleep in my car. I don't have enough money to put into an apartment and put into my music. I believe that I can win this competition and that's why I'm here. Being in "America's Got Talent," this is one of my biggest dreams ever. I got goose bumps walking in here. This is a big chance to change my life, and I'm ready for it. ‐ I wish you all the best. ‐ Thank you. ‐ And you're just a few steps away from a million dollars. Good luck, buddy. ‐ Let's go. ‐ Here we go. ‐ You can rock it, DJ. You can start it. Okay. What's up, "America's Got Talent"? Man, y'all so beautiful. Oh, my God. Look at all these faces here.
