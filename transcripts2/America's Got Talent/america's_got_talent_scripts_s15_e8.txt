I am 27 years old, and I am from Stockton, California. I just left teaching high school English, and I am now a counselor at a local community college called Delta. I did grow up in a neighborhood where, like, drugs and gang violence were rampant. My mom worked 15 different jobs to make sure that I was provided for. When I was four, my little sister was born. I don't even think I understood what being an older brother really meant at four years old. I just knew that this little person was here. My family very much insulated me into this very loving household. Then when I became a teenager, it became this anger. And what I did was I let all that frustration out through creativity. Writing most certainly was an escape for me. ‐ All right, here we go. ‐ They're all about originality right now, Brandon. ‐ And I got something for 'em. ‐ Go out there and make it happen, brother. All right, it's a pleasure to see you, my man. It's your time. ‐ Thank you. ‐ Thank you, sir. ♪ ♪ ‐ Hello. I do like my job, but in terms of my passion, what I would love to do is being able to turn my art into my full‐time work. Hi. ‐ How are you? What is your name? ‐ My name is Brandon Leake. ‐ Hi, Brandon Leake. And where are you from, Brandon? ‐ I am from a small, little city called Stockton, California. ‐ Stockton, California. And what do you do for a living? ‐ Uh, for a living, I work at a high school and a college, but I also run poetry workshops with youth in my city. ‐ Well, that's wonderful. ‐ Wow. ‐ So poetry, is that what you're gonna be doing tonight? ‐ Yes, I'm actually the first spoken word artist that you guys are ever gonna have hit this stage, so I'm super excited to bring poetry to y'all. ‐ Tell me because, uh, I don't really understand poetry. I'm gonna be honest with you. ‐ I'm a great intro for you. ‐ Okay. ‐ So tonight's poem, it's something you wrote? ‐ Oh, I only perform stuff that I write, never be able to perform anything else. ‐ Well, and what is it‐‐ what is this one about? ‐ So tonight's poem is actually an ode to my sister. ‐ Are you close to your sister? ‐ Very much. She's here with me now. ‐ Oh, she's backstage? ‐ Kind of. [chuckles] ‐ Well, we already love you. Make us love your poem. ‐ Beautiful. I got you for that. I have two facts for you. One, I'm six feet tall. And two, love is the most vulnerable thing one will ever have. And you must learn to hold onto it loosely so when it leaves, it won't exit so painfully. On July 14, 1996, an angel was brought to this earth. Her name; Danielle Marie Gibso, but I only know her as Puff. Her smile is as wide as the universe. Her eyes, they glimmer like the stars. She is my world, and my sister. I, just four years old at the time, learned what it meant to love selflessly, for on days in which my strength was but knee‐high seeing her smiling face would make my soul fly, but on March 23, 1997, I've been ground bound because she left earth to go back home amongst the stars, right next to God, but I was left here to manufacture wings out of tears and broken dreams. Yet I'm still haunted by these nightmares 'cause I have a really creative mind and sometimes it designs these alternate realities where she is still here, still alive and all the things I wish we could've done are played again, and again, and again. And I'm tired of playing God 'cause I gotta come to terms with the fact that my sister ain't never coming back. And that's the cost of love, caring for someone so much that you can't imagine living life without them. Staring at a grave like "How about I trade my six feet for yours," but that's not real. And I know I said earlier to hold onto love loosely so when it leaves, it won't exit so painfully, but if this pain and these memories are all that I got left of you, I won't never regret these scars from just trying to hold onto you. [Seinabo Sey's "Burial" playing] ♪ ♪ ‐ Wow. ‐ It is a "wow." ♪ ♪ ‐ ♪ Flowers cross the sea ♪ ♪ Memories aren't what they used to be ♪ ‐ Gosh. ‐ You're tearing up. ‐ My brother passed away the same year that your sister passed away. ‐ Man. ‐ Yeah. I can feel your pain. I know what this is. I know what it is to have somebody taken from you without you knowing. But it was very beautiful for me. ‐ Thank you. ‐ What an amazing tribute. There's something very, very special about you. ‐ Thank you. ‐ Really. This is a very difficult thing for me to judge. I shouldn't be judging it. I just want to compliment you on what you just did because it was, uh, extraordinary. ‐ Thank you for that so much. ‐ Really. ‐ So much. ‐ Well, it's amazing to me that on season 15, it's the first time that we're hearing somebody of spoken word. There was something more raw in the way it's like, singing, and talking, and just being a human a capella. No music, no nothing, just a raw heart beating in front of us. We feel your pain, we feel your love.

Like, my daughter was just born, and the only thing that I've been thinking about is like, "Man, I don't want time to slip by being at this nine‐to‐five while she's at home growing."
