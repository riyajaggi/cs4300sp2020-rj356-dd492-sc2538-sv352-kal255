Mandi: yeah, and she's Completely cool with the fact That we're sick and tired Of going through our lives being Mistaken for each other. Even our own father Can't even tell us apart. Christian: mandi and randi are Going to the university of miami In the fall, and they believe That now is the perfect time For them to establish their own Singular identities. Sean: not to play devil's Advocate, but have you tried Less drastic measures? For instance, maybe styling Your hair differently. Mandi: didn't work. I mean, people still confuse Me with randi. We even went as far As to get tattoos. Randi: and they were Pretty much worthless. Christian: why Were they worthless? Randi: well... we realized that people could Only use them to tell us apart If we're naked. Christian: god, it's good To be back. * ahh * * make me beautiful * * make me A perfect soul, A perfect mind, A perfect face, A perfect Life * Sean: heads up. Matt: w-What's this? Sean: it's a prophylactic, matt. Matt: well, yeah, I know what it is, dad. Why'd you give it to me? Sean: you're worried about your Girl's reaction to your foreskin In the first time, right? Well, you responsibly slip this On when that time comes... she won't even know. Once you get your sea legs, You can be confident enough To initiate a conversation About what foreskin is and how It really won't affect Her pleasure. Annie: how's it look now? Sean: hey, that looks great. Just want to write Somethin' on the top... good morning. Julia: morning. What you guys drawing Over there? Annie: it's so we can find Frisky. Sean: don't worry, honey. He'll show up. Jules, that smell is terrible. We gotta get a plumber out here To fix the toilet. Julia: it's the entire Septic system. It's completely backed up. Sean: well, can you get someone Out here this week? Julia: sure, sean. Can you pick up The dry cleaning today? Sean: sure. [Sighs] Are you gettin' the jump On easter, jules? Julia: i'm starting a new Business with suzanne. Sean: crazy suzanne? Julia: creative suzanne. Sean: huh. Matt: um... uh, what kind of business? Julia: they're gift baskets For women, and, uh, they're Very popular right now. There's a real market for them. Sean: well, jules, I think that's great. You can work out of the home And be with the kids, And i think that's great. Julia: i can go back to school And be with the kids, too, sean. My priorities aren't changing That greatly. Sean, softly: christ. Matt: god. Look, This is ridiculous. Why don't you guys just go To marriage counseling? Julia: because marital Counseling never works. It's just a way for people To figure out how to break up. Matt: yeah, well, you're helping No one by doin' What you're doin'. You guys need to stop dealing In stupid half-Measures and Either shit or get off the pot. Annie: he said the brown word. Matt: oh, uh...yeah, i did. I'm sorry, honey. Sorry. Woman: so...i haven't seen you Here in a while, christian. You look like an albino. [Christian chuckles] Christian: i had A work-Related injury. But now i'm back on my game and Resuming my regular activities. Woman: can i, um...interest you In our mystique tan today? Christian: just a regular bed For me, sweetheart. I'm a traditionalist. Woman: mmm. How about some, um... tanning accelerator lotion, Then? Christian: well, janelle... it all depends. Does it come With an application? Soundtrack: * in this haze, I see you... * [Excited, passionate breathing] Christian: don't worry. I'll turn you over when the Timer goes off. [Both laugh] Janelle: too early In the morning for you, baby? Christian: help me out a little. [Janelle sighs] [Christian sighs] Christian: ohhh... [christian growls with pleasure] Woman echoing: christian, Can you help me out here? I'm getting lockjaw. [Janelle giggles] Christian: uhh! [Janelle laughs] [Christian breathes sharply] Sean: dr. Santiago, how long Have you been treating The dante sisters? Dr. Santiago: 3 years, At the miami free clinic. I'm the director there. You know, i think that physical Change is a last resort, But in their case, It's a necessary one. Sean: how so? Dr. Santiago: well, last year, They both lost their virginity To the same person-- A 40-Year-Old fetishist They met in a twins chat room Who promised to love them Both equally, and he did. And afterwards they felt Like shit about it, and that's When they decided that they Wanted to be different and not Interchangeable. Half-Measures have ceased To work. Sean: so you don't believe In half-Measures. Dr. Santiago: i believe In committing fully to change. It's the commitment that brings Constructive results. I think that if mandi and Randi can look in the mirror And see singular reflection, Only then are they going to be Able to view themselves As whole and not halves. Sean: hmm. Dr. Santiago: oh, I'm still debating. Go ahead. Sean: uh... i'll have the sea bass And a pelligrino. Dr. Santiago: and i'll have A hamburger, fries, And a margarita. Waiter: you got it. Sean: you know what? I'll have what she's having. Waiter: sure. Sean: i don't have any surgeries This afternoon. One margarita will be fine. You? Dr. Santiago: oh. I need to drink. I have an a.D.D. Patient Right after this who spends Half the session lining up The kleenex box just so And the remaining 20 minutes Recounting how he obsessively Thinks about me While he's masturbating. Sean: you must get that a lot. Attention deficit disorder Patients. Vanessa: matt. Matt: mmm? Hmm? Vanessa: i want to try it. Matt: oh. Ok. Vanessa: where are you going? Matt: oh. Uh...i was gonna Get a condom. Vanessa: i want to see it first. Matt: ok. Yeah, sure. Vanessa: it looks like A shar-Pei. Are you part arab or something? Matt: uh... no. Does it-- Does it turn you off That i'm not... circumcised? Vanessa: no. Not at all. Maybe we should Just make out today. Sean: this isn't Your father's coffeepot. It actually grinds the beans In the machine. It's amazing what you can afford When you nix a marble steam room And put that money towards Something more practical. Liz: that cost more than my car. What a perk it would've been To hang out in here and have A double macchiato In between tit jobs. Sean: a macchiato, you say? Liz: sean, why did you Ask me here today? Sean: to make you an offer. If you come back, I'll double your salary. Liz: oh. That sounds Like hush money, sean. Sean: you're an invaluable part Of the team, liz. You're the best anesthesiologist I've ever worked with. And as an additional bonus, I'll throw in somethin' You've always wanted-- Complete health benefits For your partner jean. Liz: jan. Sean: i can't work This goddamn thing. Liz: i'll do it. Mmm. Jan and i broke up. Sean: i'm sorry. Liz: i'm not. For 15 years, i put up With her pot smoking And her cynicism... and finally, 2 weeks ago, I just said, "honey, i love you, But i am not in love with you." Sean: what got in you? Liz: someone pushed a gun Into my temple. You might remember that moment. Sean, you were there. Sean: i've never really... apologized for putting you In that situation, liz. Liz: no, you didn't. Sean: i'm sorry. Liz: it's all right, sean. Actually...it was the best thing That ever happened to me. A shift... has happened...in me. I can feel it. I broke up with jan because I want to be in love deeply. I sold my condo. I'm moving to the beach, 'cause That's always what i've wanted, And i figured, "what Are you waiting for?" What happened that night Got me thinking. What if i can't put off stuff Until tomorrow because I don't get another tomorrow? Sean: i felt similarly. What happened really... changed my outlook. Liz: yeah. Well... there's a big difference Between changing your outlook And changing your life, sean. [Coffee machine hums] Julia: where are you gonna stay? Sean: a hotel for tonight, And then i don't know. Julia: this is so typical Of you, sean. You don't even show me The respect you show a patient. I mean, at least with a patient, You tell them what the diagnosis Is before you operate. Sean: let's just cut the shit, Julia, starting right now. You want out of this marriage. If you didn't, You'd fight for us. But instead, all you do Is fight with me. Julia: fighting denotes Communication, sean, Which you don't do! Sean: we've talked in circles! I'm dizzy from it. I have no perspective anymore. Julia: you're A goddamn hypocrite. Sean: and i am miserable With you! And you are miserable with me, And the big difference is-- And let's just say it--You're Content in your misery, julia. I'd rather separate and try and Figure out a way to make us Connect again. We have to change this, Or we die on the vine. And if you're too paralyzed To take any action, i will. Julia: what about the kids? Sean: i'm not abdicating My role as a father. Of course i'll see them. Julia: for one hour a week, Like you do now? Don't i get a say In any of this? Sean: you do get a say. Say you're still in love With me, and i'll stay. Sean: have you ever done twins? Christian, fake accent: Mother and daughter once, but Never twins. Sean: i left last night. I left my family. I swore i wouldn't turn into My asshole of a father, and god Help me... christian: how'd julia take it? Sean: she's hurt... angry, afraid. Christian: you gonna get A divorce, or is this just Another separation? Sean: i just want to feel Something again. Christian: hey. Celebrate, You dumb mick. You're a single doctor now. Translation--Ass galore. Sean: i can't just turn Into you, christian. I'm not...that guy. Christian: now's your chance. Christian: welcome back. Liz: at double the salary, How could a lady refuse? Soundtrack: * make your desires Reality * Sean: i'll do facial, You do bodywork? Soundtrack: * make your desires Reality * Christian: 10 blade. Sean: scalpel. Soundtrack: * make your desires Reality * * make your desires reality * Julia: is it fixed? Plumber: no. It's a wicked, big clog. I had to run out And get a bigger snake. Suzanne: don't be embarrassed, Julia. Joe used to clog up the toilet, Too, and leave it for me to fix. You know, it's not until they Leave that you realize How much you settled. [Julia sighs] [Sniffles] Julia: i'm sorry, suzanne. Um, the--Why are we putting These eye masks in our baskets? Suzanne: you get a hot flash. You plop it out of the fridge And onto your eyes. Menopausal women will love them. Plumber: mrs. Mcnamara. Julia: yeah? Plumber: i fixed your clog. And...i found this. Suzanne: what's she gonna do With a turd, bronze it? Jesus! Plumber: it's a gerbil. My daughter has one. Suzanne: annie lost her gerbil, Right? I saw the sign outside. Ohhh. Julia: poor frisky. It--It must've...climbed up And fallen in. Suzanne: ohhh. Plumber: no, that's impossible. Gerbils can't climb porcelain. There's no traction For their claws. Somebody threw this in. You know, i saw a boy's bike Outside the house. You have a teenage son. Isn't that right, mrs. Mcnamara? I don't want to freak you out About this, but... they say ted bundy Started out this way... torturing small animals. Suzanne: oh, my god. Matt. Julia: my son didn't do it. I did. Suzanne: you accidentally Ran it over when you were Vacuuming or something. Right? And--And you didn't Want annie to know. See? That explains it. Julia: it wasn't an accident. Plumber: there'll be no charge. I don't want your money. What kind of mother are you? [Rap music playing] Matt: why won't you give me The circumcision? He doesn't even have to know. Christian: carving up your dick Is a little more telltale Than buying you a 6-Pack On the sly, matty. Matt: uh, hi. I'll have a, uh... dewar's straight up. [Christian chuckles] Christian: he'll have a coke. I'll have the dewar's, Sweetheart. Thank you. Besides... i'm of the opinion that your Father's right about this one. You don't need a circumcision. Matt: fine. If you guys won't Help me, i'll go To another surgeon. Christian: who will operate Without a signed Parental consent form. Good luck. The problem isn't your dick, Matty. It's your confidence. You were timid and embarrassed. She saw that, and that's What turned her off. Matt: thanks. Um...why are we here? Christian: because "we"... are gonna work On the confidence part. [Matt laughs] Christian, chuckling: yeah. Matt: you're kidding me. Right? Christian: au contraire, My little virginator. I've arranged for you to just Get it out of the way. A little bang under your belt, And i firmly believe you'll be Able to bicycle over to Vanessa's place, grab that Peachy ass, and show her How it's done... with no fear. Girls don't care if you have A 2-Inch pecker, hairy ass, Or balls like cranberries. What they care about is that You know what you're doing. [Sighs] So, which girl? Christian: behind me On the stairs. Her name's avanti. Rumor has it she can suck The peel off an apple. Matt: i feel entirely creepy About paying someone To pretend they like me. [Christian laughs] Matt: no. Hey. Besides, man, I'm not gonna cheat on vanessa. I love her. Haven't you ever had that? Christian: once. Avanti: hey, papi. Matt: uh, hey. Avanti: hey. Matt: ahem... [christian laughs] Matt: uh...yeah. Uh, thank you. Um...but, uh... no. No, thank you. Christian: fair enough. [Sighs] Mmm. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go upstairs and pay Someone to pretend to like me. Soundtrack: * nothin' Like sex * [Continuing, indistinct] * round and round * [Continuing, indistinct] * round in a circle Like a star * [Continues, indistinct] Avanti: what's wrong, baby? You like boys? [Christian sighs] Julia: i think you like boys. [Christian sighs] Avanti: i think you like boys. [Laughs] Come on, baby, why can't you Get caliente? Christian: because you've got A carved face, and in my Estimation, that's the worst Tit job i've ever seen. Here's my business card. You want to look like a woman Instead of a carnival freak, Call me. Sean: mr. Brancato, I've invited Our psychologist dr. Pendleton To sit in on our consultation. Mr. Brancato, tell me what You don't like about yourself. Brancato: it's my dick. I hate my dick. Sean: you feel it's... inadequate? Dr. Pendleton: well... would you like to show us? [Music starts] [Music stops] Sean: it looked like one of Those summer blood sausages You get in the hickory farms Christmas gift sampler baskets. [Christian laughs] Christian: how many enlargement Surgeries has this guy Been through? Sean: 5. He wants us to harvest Fat from his glutes and Inject it into his shaft. If he can't go longer, He'll go wider. Dr. Pendleton: dr. Mcnamara, I take issue with your Condescending tone. Mr. Brancato's not To be pitied. Sean: are you saying you're for Giving him the operation? Because that wouldn't be My recommendation. Christian: why, sean? Because you find it Personally disturbing? Correct me if i'm wrong, but Didn't you hire dr. Pendleton To make recommendations based On psychological profiling? That's what he's doing. Dr. Pendleton, As you were saying... Dr. Pendleton: well, with every Operation, as his penis becomes Larger, mr. Brancato takes A personal risk. If he needs a self-Esteem boost To actually make a positive Change in his life, I say we give it to him. Mmm. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go for a jog and let My miso dressing set For an hour. Christian: dr. Pendleton. I'd like to join you, If you don't mind. Dr. Pendleton: oh. That would be nice. Thank you. Christian: i'll catch up. Sean: if you have issue With something i do or say, Take it up with me privately, Not in front of our staff. Christian: absolutely. And likewise, i'd appreciate it If you could, uh, send me a memo Notifying me of staff salary Increases. If calling mr. Brancato and Scheduling surgery is, uh, Too distasteful for you, I'm happy to do it. Sean: you agreed we needed to Rethink our ethical philosophy Here. I'm doing that. Christian: you know, i'm fine With hiring a shrink and doing Pro bono as long as we take On other cases to finance Your sainthood. I'm playing your game, sean. Once in a while, throw me The goddamn ball. Dr. Pendleton: really? So...you're tellin' me You couldn't even get it up For some hot geisha gash Like that? Christian: my urologist says It's psychological. Dr. Pendleton: i'm--I'm sorry, Christian. I feel like we're crossin' The professional line here. You're my employer. Christian: that's right. I pay your salary. So give me my money's worth. Christian: i think i know Why this is happening. I just, uh... i just don't know how to fix it. Recently, a married woman Threw herself at my jock. I passed, but... since then i find myself Thinking about her Whenever i'm with someone else. She's mentally stalking me. The problem is further Complicated because she's The wife of one of my friends. [Dr. Pendleton clicks tongue, Speaks latin] Christian: sorry. I was never an altar boy. Dr. Pendleton: it's latin for "That which nourishes me Destroys me." You have 2 choices. You can destroy your friendship And nourish your sexual Appetite by banging the horny Housewife, or you can nourish Your friendship and destroy The sexual fantasy By rejecting her. And once you choose, Once you're...firm... that feeling will be Reciprocated in your dockers. That'll be 150 bucks, and i'm Not available the entire month Of august. [Dr. Pendleton chuckles] [Christian sighs] Julia: 3 sugars. Right? Christian: i don't drink coffee. Julia: 3 sugars In your iced tea. Now i remember. I'll get some.
