 Nip/Tuck (2003â€“2010): Season 1, Episode 8 - Cara Fitzgerald - full transcript 
 Matt and his Jewish schoolmate enjoy training him how to live as devout Jew without truly believing and use marijuana, but accidentally hit a 16-year old girl which was tying her shoelaces and just stood up unnoticed while Matt was driving. They thought it was just an animal and left, but Sean reads in the paper about the Cara Fitzgerald case. Miss Devon Greco wants her nose changed because it reminds her of her abusive real father, Christian refuses the case as unrealistic expectations. Michael Shannon insists Dr. Troy (literally) handles the embarrassing birthmark-removal from his ball-sack 'in time for his expensive honeymoon' within two weeks. The boys learn Cara is a model student; Matt visits her in hospital, as coma patient, where he meets her mother Kate, pretending to be a member of the prayer club she founded and learns her family are Christian Scientists, hence refuse drugs. Seans lover Megan O'Hara insists on breast implants after cancer and a divorce. Psychiatrist Grace Santiago's indiscretion makes both partners want to fire her, and find out about each-others unprofessional relationships. Matt tells Sean only that he cares for Cara ands asks him to do her plastic surgery. Christian is shocked to hear on TV his 'about to marry' patient Michael Shannon is a Catholic priest who just escaped trial for sexual abuse of several young boys and realizes they helped the monster hiding his intimate identity. Henry wants to confess for religious reasons, Sean tries to convince Cara's mother not to refuse 'sinfully unnatural' plastic surgery and gets a court order so he and Troy can do an urgent operation to save her eyesight. Christian changes his mind about florist Devon Greco who admits she lacked the courage to press charges till her abusive father became terminal. Seeing father Shannon still seems to crave boys Christian goes to confession with him for the first time in 22 years, only to insist he confesses to the police under threat of scalpel and photos- it works. Now he tells Sean about his own abusive foster father Mr. Troy who bribed him to 'sell his body' as a boy.

O'hara, after Looking at your chart i have to Say i'm a little confused. You decided not to have breast Reconstruction during your Surgery. You then came in for a Consultation and again decided Against implants. Now you suddenly want them. Has something in your life Changed recently that's led you To this decision? Sean: i agree that the implants Aren't necessary. Grace: so you're against the Surgery, then? Sean: well, no. It's Mrs. O'hara's choice. It's her body. I think, and i've told her this, That she looks spectacular with Or without breasts. Megan: no one's ever said that To me before. Grace: not even your husband? Megan: jim wasn't very Communicative. Grace: unlike the person you're Seeing now? Megan: i didn't say i was Seeing anyone. Grace: oh. I'm sorry. I just Jumped to the new partner, new Set of pressures theory. For many women, breasts are the Root place of sexual confidence. Megan: that's right. I would agree with that. Megan: i am dating someone. No, it's more than that. I'm... i'm in love with him. It's the first time in years I felt this alive, and after the Chemo and the pain and the... living death, i want to embrace These feelings with every ounce Of my being. Megan: i wanna make love to him With the lights on...without Worrying about racing to a lamp Because i'm self-Conscious. I don't want to edit one minute Of my life. Sean: don't do it for him. Megan: no, i'm doing it for Me, sean. Grace: he's having an affair With her. Christian: why would you assume That? Grace: because of their Interaction--She admitted in The room that she was in love With him. Christian: sean's not the Cheating kind. Grace: that's not necessarily True--70% of all men cheat. The statistics are astounding. No, i'm disturbed by this. A plastic surgeon giving his Mistress implants so that she Can be more sexually uninhibited With him. Don't you find that unsettling? Wait a minute. Who am i talking with? Of course you wouldn't. She's been through cancer, now A separation. I don't know. This patient just Seems so fragile to me. I don't want her making a rash Decision for the wrong reasons. Christian: you want me to talk To him? Grace: no. If i make an Accusation that's unfounded, he Could fire me. But maybe you could feel it out. When he talks to you about Devon greco, casually mention The implants and see if you Sense anything. Christian: whoa, killer, back Up--Why would sean talk to me About devon greco? I bounced her case over to Hargrove. Grace: she was very upset by Your nonchalance. She asked if there was another Doctor here she could speak to, So i made an appointment for Sean to see her on friday. Look, i'm gonna head to lunch. Thanks for listening to me About megan o'hara, but, Please, don't tell him we had This conversation. Christian: of course not. Sean: how dare you tell my Partner that i'm having an Affair with a patient! Grace: i can't believe i was so Stupid as to think i could trust You with even a moment of Vulnerability. You're an asshole. Christian: and you're an Arrogant little ph.D. In a prada Knockoff skirt who shouldn't be Spreading lies about my partner Or accusing me of being rude to A consult and then trying to Bypass my executive decisions. Sean: who else did you unload On, dr. Santiago? The nurses? The janitor?! If i discover you weakened the Morale of this office with your Unfounded malicious gossip-- Grace: what, sean? You'll fire Me? Are my accusations that Unfounded? Sean: you mind your own goddamn Business! Grace: this is my business! This patient is my business! You have put me in a difficult Situation, and this is not the First time you've done it. Sean: let's take a break. Grace: no! I am sick of the Secrets! Some of which are mine. Let's just put it all on the Table. Sean: i'm not having an affair! Christian: i believe you, sean. Grace: i don't believe you. I don't believe you because i Know your marriage is in Trouble. You told me that right before Your hand crept up my thigh Under the table. Christian: fascinating Late-Breaking information here At the people's court. When did this happen? Sean: the day before i hired Her. Christian: and did you hire her Because you were afraid she'd Sue? Grace: lawsuits usually happen When people are fired after They sleep with the boss. Christian: is that a threat? Sean: wait. You slept with Grace? Grace: it won't happen again. Sean: god damn it, are you out Of your mind?! How could you do this?! Christian: sleep with someone That rejected you? Sean: leave! Go home. Sean: just for today. Christian: i don't want her Here, sean. She's a troublemaker, and her Shoes are cheap. Sean: shut up, christian. Shut up and let me think. If julia even suspected for a Second i was having an affair, That would be it. She'd file for divorce, she'd Take the kids away from me. I can't risk that. That's why i would never have An affair. Christian: give megan o'hara The implants, sean. Schedule it. Sean: i can't do that now, after Grace's ridiculous accusation. Christian: it would look Suspicious if you didn't do the Operation. Grace is obviously deluded, About you, about me. You have my wholehearted Support. [Knock on door] Nurse: excuse me. Your son is here to see you? Matt: you said you wanted to do More pro bono work. Sean: what's going on with you? I thought you didn't even know This girl? Matt: i know her. I don't know her well. Matt: i visited her in the Hospital. That story you read really got To me. Somebody ruined her life, dad. Her mother's this fanatical Religious person who doesn't Believe in medicine. Sean: matt, the line that Divides church and state Sometimes also applies to Medicine and the patient. You and i might not agree with Her mother's beliefs-- Matt: no. When the bandages come Off, she is gonna look like a Monster. I can't help her. You can. Please.

Christan: i can't do it, sean. Sean: you can't do what? Christan: i've been praying... to forgive, but i can't do it. Sean: the authorities will deal With him now. Christan: not him. Me. Sean: what did you do? Christan: i let him touch me. For years, i let him touch me. Sean: who? Christan: mr. Troy. Your foster father? He's dead, and i thought That would end it, But it didn't. Sean: christian, you were just a Boy. If he abused you... it was his fault. He had the power. He's the one. Christan: i didn't have anything When he took me in. I wanted to be...somebody. He said he'd give me money If i let him touch me. And i did. I bought things. I sold myself. Oh... oh, god... i sold myself. Oh, god. Oh, god.
