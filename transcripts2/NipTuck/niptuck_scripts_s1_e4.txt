Merril: you can make fun all You want, slick, but because Of those billboards, my business Has tripled in the past month. I work 18-Hour days just To keep up. Christian: sounds exhausting. Merril: sounds like i need A partner. Christian: was that an offer, Merril? Merril: maybe you and i can Have lunch some time. Christian: that would be A consolatory meal, Because i'm going to kick your Ass and win this contract. Merril: you're a better surgeon Than me, christian, i'll give You that, but you're no longer A better salesman. Hello. Matt: i like the outfit. Girl: really? Thanks. You need to stand out in this Business if you're going To make it, you know? Have like a gimmick? That's why i'm always sucking On something. Oh, my god. That sounded awful. Are you in this business, too? Matt: i'm an agent. So, uh, i guess you want to be An actress. Girl: i'm trying to be. Wallace has a strict star System, though. She says you got to start at The bottom and work your way up. So right now, i'm a fluffer. Matt: so tell me, what exactly Does a fluffer of your caliber Do? Girl: give head to guys to keep Them hard and stuff in-Between Shots. Matt: cool. So, uh, fluffing all day-- That's got be a real turn-Off After a while, right? Girl: um... actually... it gets me really horny. That's why i have to keep Sucking on these. Oops. [Giggles] Matt: so what happens now? [Girl giggles] Grace: i tried to stop her from Packing, but there's just No reasoning with her. Sean: mrs. Koosman, where are You going? Mrs. Koosman: home. What kind of brothel are you Running here?

It looks like we're running A casting call for messy mouths, Part 2. Excuse me. Christian: you're overreacting. Wallace has guaranteed us 10 of her girls a month. That's implants, lipo, Reductions. Who gives a shit if koosman Bolted? Sean: it's one thing to bring Business in. It's another to drive it away. Christian: take off your Judgemental blinders, sean. The line that divides the porn Industry and plastic surgery Is a thin one. We're both selling fantasy, Aren't we? Grace: can i say something? From a patient's perspective, It's very important to feel Comfortable in your Surroundings, post-Surgery. Sean: see? It's a psychological issue As well. That settles it. We can't provide proper medical Care for the majority of our Patients by taking on a contract That offends them. Christian: then they'll go To bobolit. Sean: fine! Christian: you haven't been here Long enough to put in your 2 cents. Let me explain something to you, Dr. Santiago. Without wallace, we're losing Money, and that means cutting Back on gratuitous expenses, Like excess employees. [Sean sighs] Receptionist: dr. Mcnamara? Sophia lopez, line 3. Sean: hello? Sophia: dr.

I'm talking hollywood elite, European royalty. We charge twice the price And get all the time off We need. All you got to do is bring Your talent. Christian: what am i worth To you, merril? Merril: you want numbers? I'll get my lawyers to draft An agreement. Christian: i want parity. I want a guarantee that all Decisions are arrived at by both Partners, and i want it in Writing. Merril: no problem. This is a good move for you, Christian. Those cleft palate sean's Bringing in ain't helping you Retire early...ok? Don't get me wrong. I like sean. He's a conservative family man, And that's great, but you And i are more alike. We're ambitious, single, Good looking... and we understand that in Business, success is the only Standard.

Julia: what you do with your Life and where you stick your Dick is your business. What you do with matt is mine. From now on you stay away From him! Christian: you're being way Too dramatic, julia. Come on. You can't lay down A law like that. Matt's like a son to me. Julia: and he is a son to me, And a real father would never Do what you've done. You'll never be capable of being A real father, christian. You want to know why? Because real fathers would never Turn someone they love into A filth-Loving moral-Less Bottom feeder. Real fathers want their sons To be me more than they are, Not carbon copies. [Door slams] [Knocks on door] Sean: hello, marcus. It's been a while. Marcus grayson: well, you know How delicate g.R.S. Is, sean. Fistulas are fairly common when You're dealing with vaginal Construction. I'm sure, uh--Uh-- Sean: marci. Marcus: right. I'm sure she's Just going to be fine. Sean: you know, i still have All my notes from your class. Why aren't you teaching anymore? Marcus: well, when The university... denied me tenure, i went back Into private practice. Then about 5 years ago, i got... i had to deal with this Malpractice bullshit... and it killed me. Sean: didn't you have insurance? Marcus: i did. I can't afford it now. Sean: marcus...that's crazy. Marcus: well, it's no crazier Than half the stuff they do down In mexico, which is where most Of these transsexuals go because They can't afford it up here. It's too expensive. I at least offer an alternative. Sean: but if you can't do The job right, what kind of Alternative is that? Marcus: excuse me?! Sean: look at this place. I can see why you're having Problems with these surgeries. Marcus: don't talk to me like That, sean. I was a doctor before you were Born. I almost invented most of these Procedures...remember? No, this is not johns hopkins, But i can do what most other Surgeons can't. Now you had a great deal of Skill, but you had no bravado, And it takes a combination of The 2--Bravado and skill--In Order to be a brilliant surgeon. Sean: i'd rather be a good Surgeon who helps people Than a brilliant surgeon Who hurts them. Marcus: heh. Now, is this About what i do, or do you have A problem with who i do it to... hmm? I think you're the one with The problem, sean. Sean: what i have a problem with Is you destroying people's Lives. Look at you. Can you even hold your hands Steady? You reek of alcohol. But don't confuse yourself into Thinking you're some kind of Hero working on The disenfranchised. You're just a sad old drunk Who can't retire because He doesn't have anything else To hold on to. [Sighs] You're the one who inspired me To be a surgeon. I wanted to be you. Marcus: well, you're gonna be Me, sean. You are...on my path. [Sighs] You're a success now. 40 is when it starts. Ok? The dutiful wife gets tired of Your hours and your lack of Emotional intelligence. She'll stay around for another 5 years, if you're lucky. Mine left when i was 50, But she'll leave. When father's day comes around And christmas and thanksgiving, And you sit alone with your... diplomas... and the thoughts of--Of--Of-- All these people whose lives You've saved, except your own. So, yes, i drink. Sean: either you shut yourself Down, or i will. Marcus: sean, i didn't mean To hurt anybody. God help me. I didn't mean to. [Sighs] Matt: so where are you? Christian: take a look to your Right. [Matt laughs] [Laughs] Is that your car? Christian: i landed an exclusive Contract. Thought i'd treat myself. I'm leaving it to you In my will. That is not the only reason To celebrate, matty. Your test came back from The lab. You are as clean as the day You were born. Matt: oh, my god. Seriously? Christian: seriously. I'm proud of you, kid. You cheated your first s.T.D. Way to go. Don't do it again. Your mom's probably calmed down By now. I thought we'd go over and tell Her the good news together. You drive. You're gonna love this car. Swear to god, you drive down The street, the girls are going To follow you home. Matt: yeah. Yeah. Uh, look... no, thanks. [Christian laughs] Matt: i don't want to meet girls Because of the car i drive, Or pick them up at strip clubs Or porn parties. I'm not you, man. Christian: i was only trying To cheer you up. Matt: yeah, i know. Look, i got last period, So i gotta...tch. I gotta head off. Christian: oh, wait. Maybe we could go see a movie Or something. You got to at least go for A ride with me. Matt: i'll see ya. Sean: keep out of the sun for At least 3 weeks and remember To put the ointment on. But otherwise, it's very... feminine. Sophia: you think so? What happened to dr. Grayson? Sean: he's retired. It's ok. He won't hurt anybody again. Sophia: i talked to one girl. He did a good job on her. Maybe he doesn't always drink. Sean: you're not... sophia, his office was Unsanitary. His practice-- Sophia: i know. I know that. I also know of an honorable bank Teller who makes no money, Who hasn't yet become what she's Supposed to become. [Weeps] Sean: i'll help you find that Person... free of charge. Sophia: you'll be my doctor? Are you serious? You're very progressive, Dr. Sean mcnamara. Christian: it's christian. Can you hang on a second? What's up? Sean: i'm ready to revisit The wallace forsythe issue. Christian: why? Sean: i've come to the Conclusion that with guaranteed Money flowing in, we're free to Take on more pro bono. Additionally... i think you're right. I need to loosen up. So what if these women are In porn? They're not hurting anybody. Christian: yes, they are. I terminated that contract This afternoon. Sean: what are you talking About?
