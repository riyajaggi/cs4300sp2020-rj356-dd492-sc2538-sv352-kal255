Well, maybe I can repay you by naming our first child after you. Oh, yes, do!Even if it's a boy. I think "regina" is a masculine name in some latino cultures. Mom, I'm not in love with him, okay? It's just been three dates and so flowers. I know, but just don't put off the wedding. I mean, your aunt phoebe will not be happy If she dies before seeing you married, And I think those pig vows only last about 13 years. Sam, um, if tonight is your first night with kevin, Don't you think your carpet should match your drapes? What?What does that mean? I think it means your bra should match your panties, but I could. I could be wrong. Oh. Okay. Well, let's see what we got. Oh, darn, these are all still wet. And I don't wanna go all the way to todd's for underwear. Mom, did-Did you happen to put any of my ce lingerie up in my room today? Um, no, but you can borrow some of mine. I have a leopard print set that makes your father roar. I think they call that jungle fever. No. And I'm off to todd'S. Whatcha doin'? All right, I-I wanted to spare you from this, But I have a date with kevin tonight, And I would like it if my carpet matched my drapes. Okay? Yeah, I don't think that phrase means what you think it means. Whatever. What I'm trying to say is that, you know, tonight. Tonight might be the night that, you know. Kevin and I get intimate. I hope this isn't hard for you to hear. Not if it isn't hard for you to hear that you're holding my girlfriend's panties. But they're in my drawer. Well, you know, chloe's over a lot, And I thought it'd be easier if she had her own drawer. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, of course it would, Because that's what people in, um, relationships do They give each other drawers. Doi. Yeah. It's tiny. Good for her. I'm sorry we had to skip dessert. I'm so, so, so sad. - How does this come off? - Why? So I could take it off? Oh, yeah, right. Naked. Well, that makes sense. No, I mean, in order for me to get naked, I gotta take my clothes off. - I have an idea. - What? Turn off the lights. Watch how fast. Dena. Guess what? I'm in love. - =Www. Ydy.

You've been to one of those raves, haven't you? You're 8 miles high. It's called a smile, mom. I was with kevin, and you were Oh! Thank you. Oh, well. All the thanks I need is that you finally admit I know what's best for you. Um, well, gosh. Come on. Sit down. I have some very exciting ideas about your life. And I will even listen to them. You know why? Because I am in love! - You are not in love. - Yes, I am. I know what I feel. No, you don'T. This is all brand-New for you. It's the first time you had sex. You know, the old you would have already changed your cell phone number, And you would've met two new guys on the way to work. La-La-La, I'm not listening to you. I love kevin, and you can't stop me. - Thanks, sweetie. - You're welcome. It is just biology. You have sex. Your face gets flushed. You feel all warm and wonderful. It seems like love, But it's actually nature's way of telling you to stick your panties in your purse and run. And did you just hand your secretary a cup of coffee? Uh-Huh. Sammy, I'm gonna sneak out a little early. The boots I wanted just went on sale. Oh, yeah. Sure, trace. Have fun. Okay, don't take this the wrong way, But parts of this new sam make me really hate you. Hey, did you know that there's a web site where you can send somebody a little bear? I'm going to vomit. I'm gonna send you one. Mornin'. Morning, you. What are you doing? Did you know That you had a drawer that only had socks in it? Yeah, I did. I call that my sock drawer. I was thinking that if you put your socks from that drawer Into your underwear drawer, Then there would be this whole, big, empty drawer where I could put some of my thingS. - You want a drawer? - Yeah. I mean, only if it's okay with you. Yeah, yeah, I guess I just hadn't thought of it. Oh, well, it's a good thing I thought of it for you. That's why we make such a good team. I'll see you in the kitchen. I'm gonna go pick out a coffee mug. Okay, so now what? Hey. There. You snuck up again. You should wear a bell. Oh, is this it? You getting your things out? Some. Kevin gave me a drawer. Of what? A drawer for me. Oh. Does he know that? Uh, yes, todd. I doubt that this is his first relationship. Yeah, but it is yours, and I'm only saying this as a friend. Remember how we decided to be friends? Yes, although I do think that on some level, We were just saying that to keep from being hurt. - I wasn'T. - Neither was I. - You know, don't you think you're moving kinda fast? - No. - It's only been two weeks. - So? Life is not a dress rehearsal, bucko. The curtain has gone up, and I am not gonna be late to the show again. - Bucko? - Yeah, you heard me. - It's got wheels. - Whatever. Sam. - I like you. - Mm! Oh, my god. I was just thinking the same thing. How weird is that? Well, I mean, Maybe not so weird that two people who like each other would be thinking, "I like you. " I mean, if we were both thinking, Like "a polar bear can walk 30 miles in a day, " I mean, that would be. Sorry. You were saying? That maybe we should, you know, slow things down. Slow? How slow? I think we should. Stop. Seeing each other. That's very slow. Make it stop! Just teach me how to be dead inside! Oh, sweetie. Oh, crying makes me feel like I should be comforting, and I don't do comforting. Well, why did he break up with me? Maybe it's 'cause I wasn't good in bed. Oh, please. Oh, you can hit a guy in the head with a book during sex, And it's still gonna be good for him, In fact, i knew a guy who you had to hit right in the head with a book before he could e- Oh, my god. What is this? I'm making a card for kevin with pictures of us together. I didn't actually have any pictures of us actually together, But I had some pictures of me, And then I cut his head out of some of his business cards. That's why his expression's always the same. No. - What? - Stop. Just let him go. Do not try and get him back. I'm not trying to get him back! I just thought that maybe he might wanna see what we would look like together on vacation in paris! Oh, my god. Okay. That's it. We're going straight to my house. Come, get up. Come on, come on. Okay, and we're gonna go, And we're just gonna get some wine on the way. Andrea, I can't drink. I'm an alcoholic. No, babe, you're not. What? Hold on a minute. I might want that in pink instead. You're not an alcoholic. A judge made you go to A.A Because you got drunk before a flight and had a huge freak-Out on the plane. Oh, great. So I'm afraid to fly, too. Afraid to fly coach. You even forced me to come along to serve you drinks So you felt like you were in first class. So I can drink? Oh, yeah. Go. I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give I will survive I will survive Oh!I love this song! It's like. It's like gloria gaynor's, like, looking right into my soul. You know? All right, sing it, gloria, again. At first I was afraid I was petrified Oh, my god! I will be so happy when you finally re-Experience everything, And the spark of wonder in your eyes goes dark again. Oh, jeez. This is what I needed, you guys- Just a night with my closest. Closest girlfriends. I learned how to carry on, And now you're back who wants more wine? And your mother. Oh, andrea, you know, you don't have to finish every bottle. It's not cracker jacks. There's no prize at the bottom. The prize is, the more I drink, the blurrier you get. "To sam!" To forgetting that son of a bitch. Yeah, to hell with him! Yeah, he was a son of a bitch! Don't say that about him. Why would you sathat about him? I think I heard it somewhere. Kevin was a kind and thoughtful man. He was so sweet. He was an ass. I'm c-Confused about my role here. I- I had such big plans for them. The two of them were gonna buy a second house in asheville, north caroli. Not boca raton. It's way too humid. You know, my hair would never. D- Um, and asheville has this. Thriving mountain crafts community. Ugh, god. Oh, it's my own fault. I completely misjudged that kevin. I thought he could handle a girl with head problems. Oh, mom, it's not your fault, okay? It's not. It's my fault. You know why? Because I'm unlovable! You are not unlovable. Oh, honey, no, no. Don'T. I mean, true, there were times you were difficult to warm up to, But even then I loved you. Babies are hard. I love you, too, sam. And what aut todd?Todd loved you, hmm? Todd! Todd! It might interest you to know This isn't even close to the most embarrassing thing I've seen you do on this sidewalk. Todd! May I ask why you're doing this? I want todd. The "who" is no longer a secret to anyone on this side of the lake. I was wondering why. 'Cause I need to know if he really loved me. Okay? Todd! Come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Todd! Let's get some coffee in you. Okay. Oh, good news, frank. I don't have a drinking problem anymore. Gee! Whoopsie daisy. No, now it's mine. Oh, drinking is like love. It starts out okay. The singing and laughing part is real fun, Then it just takes this ugly turn around the crying and the yelling part. I would tell you about the throwing up part, But I don't wanna ruin the surprise. That is it. I am never falling in love again. Of course you will, And it may hurt, But you will survive. Oh, my god. You speak the words of gloria. My wife and I karaoke. She does an excellent devo. You are so lucky. You have a wife. I'll bet you she has a drawer. She has all the drawers. Yeah, but she loves you. Someone loves you. How great is that? Someone once said, "The joy in life "is not in hearing the words 'I love you, ' But in being lucky enough to say them. That's beautiful. - Who said that? - The lead character in my screenplay. It happens just before the shark gets him. And he was right. Some people never do let themselves express their love. How can you not express it, you know? Like, who can't express love? Wait. Wait. Wait. Hey, sam. - Uh-Huh? - Are we living together? Don't be an idiot. Well, I mean, I'm here all the time. I've got a drawer. I've got a third of the closet. No, we are not living together, Because that would imply that you would be paying half of the mortgage, And I don't see that happening. Yeah, I don't either. But I can still hang out here, right? You know, eat what's in the fridge, Sleep in your bed every night? If you stopped, I'd kill you. I love you, too. Did I not say it to todd? Maybe I didn'T. Maybe I never even told him that I loved him. Todd! What? What's going on? Did I ever tell you that I loved you? I'm sorry? - Did I? - Out loud? No. Well, you scratched it in the trunk of my car once. It was okay. It was an old car. - Well, I did. - What? I loved you, And I'm sorry that I didn't tell you before, okay? But I'm pretty sure that I did. I mean, then. Not now., It was before. All right, let's just pretend like it's a long time ago, okay? Just... ready? I love you. Then, 'cause not now. F.Y.I Okay, then. You bet. Okay. Todd. I love you. Shut up, russ. Well, I expressed it. I expressed the hell out of it. It went well, then. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, from now on, I'm only gonna say "I love you" to guys After I don't love them anymore, Because you know what?It goes so much better. - Sounds like a plan. - Yeah. Okay, except for this once. - Frank - Don't you dare. I wasn't, really. So love really is a battlefield. I learned that from another prophet on that cd at andrea'S. The difference is, in battle, You're supposed to shoot all your ammo at once and annihilate the other side. In love, Sometimes you just gotta hold your fire a little and see what happens. Hey, tracy, can you grab me that file on the woodcrest property, please? Uh, in a minute, sweetie. I gotta dr At least I know I can express myself now. You know what, tracy? I'M. I'm not sure if this whole girlfriend thing is working out so well. Works for me. No, you work for me. I am your boss, and you are my assistant, Which means that you have my tanzania peaberry on my desk When I get here in the morning, And you keep our ass in that chair at night until you're sure I am at home in my jammies. Are we clear, girlfriend? Yes, ms. Newly. Maybe thkey to survival in love and war is balance. Did I say "please"? I'm sorry. Um, please, and thank you. Now get back to work! Please. Right now! Thank you. Please.
