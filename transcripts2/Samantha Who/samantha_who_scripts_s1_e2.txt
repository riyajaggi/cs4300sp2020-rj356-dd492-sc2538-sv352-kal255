 I have this dream. I was hit by a car, lost my memory and moved in with my parents. Rise and shine! Wake up, sleepyhead. You're not in a coma anymore. Come on. Get up. We got a busy day. We're gonna get our haircut together, just alike. Please let it be a dream. Oh, it's okay. I'm your father. Yeah, I know. You told me. - Samantha, breakfast! - And that's your mother.

 She's in the kitchen. Yeah, see, I remember what I know now, just not anything that I knew before the accident. And the kitchen is where we keep the food. That's good to know. Excuse me. There she is. Samantha, you remember your childhood friend Dena? I head off for work, so I just thought I'd see if you wanted to do something. Oh, I'm sorry, dear. She's busy with me today. Actually, I was gonna kinda be busy with me today. That doesn't sound like any fun. If we're not gonna get to know each other again, what was the point of you getting hit by that car? That's very true, but I was in this coma and I have no memories,

 and I kinda just wanna find out who I am. I don't even know what I do. I don't know what my job is. I don't know anymore. You haven't spoken to me in 2 years. 20 for me. I think it was something in a building. Oh. I guess that rules out astronaut, then. You know what? Maybe I have some sort of business card or something like that. Let's see. What do we got-- I have a doctor's appointment card for today. Who's... Dr. Kegoshian? Wait, from the hospital? Ooh! Is he the brain doctor? Or is that that guy who got us to donate her organs? Oh, I liked him. He was funny! - You were gonna donate my organs? - Not your eyes. I could never look anybody in the face again without wondering. All right, well, we don't want that, so, I guess I'll just keep this doctor's appointment, and then you and I can get to know each other when you drive me into the city. Sweetheart, don't you remember? I told you, I'm getting my hair trimmed. Howard, she's starting to forget things again. Sorry. You must have berries in your shampoo. Mr. Cellophane, no! No, it's fine. Thank you for the ride, Dena. It's just, oh, God, mothers, right? It's like, what is that, you know? It's like, enough already. Just go away. Right? Mine's dead. - God, I'm--I'm sorry. - No! Please. You have amnesia. But you were real sweet when you found out. You even insisted that we move the day of the funeral - so you could be there. - Oh, I did that? Yeah. You still didn't come. But you sent some beautiful flowers. Well... there's that. - I didn't send any flowers, did I? - Not really. All things considered, I feel fine-- I mean, physically. Open, please. Maybe my mom's right. It's that maybe I am just too eager to get back into my life. But when everything is a mystery, you really just wanna... grab hold and... squeeze. You're not a neurologist, are you? So have you decided to go up one cup size or two? Is there a three? I mean, just... Hey, Andrea! Uh, Ahn-drea! Whatever it is. I was just around the corner 'cause, did you know that I was getting a boob job? Yeah! I think it's a fantastic idea. Really? Why did I want one? Do you think I need one? Oh, who cares? But I get all your old shirts when they don't fit. Okay, here, I'll just ride up with you. That's one good thing about your little bonk on the head, huh? - What? - It got rid of your fear of elevators. Yeah, it's over. Okay. I'm sorry. Sorry. Yeah, it's cool, it's cool. That's some valuable information. That's I wanted. I wanted to find things out, get back into my life. I want you back into your life, too, but don't you think it's a little too soon - to go back to work? - That's the thing. I never even-- thank you-- asked where I work or what I do for a living. I mean, so where do I work? Do you know? What? What? - That's me. - Yeah. I work here! I work here! This is my office. I'm a vice president? Mmm, sookie, sookie. V.P., V.P. Okay, now we are getting somewhere. All right, what do we do? Wait a minute. You're a lawyer. Am I lawyer? Is that hard? 'Cause that sounds hard. Okay, it's time for you to go, but no more questions. See, no one here should really know about your little memory problem. Any sign of weakness is sniffed out and destroyed. Yeah, wait. Where do they think that I've been? - I don't know. Maybe rehab. - You told them I was in rehab?! Rehab is super trendy, and it makes you seem young. Okay, but wait a minute. What do we do here? Oh, my God. It's you. Hi. Sorry. - It's your secretary. - I'm sorry. I didn't expect you in today, - but welcome back. Here's your apple. - Oh, thank you. Forgot to start it for you. Sorry. I make her start my apple? Look, just get out of here before anyone else knows you're back, - and I'll fill you in later... - Yeah, like what we do? Yeah, so-- Good morning, Mr. Chapman. You have the documents on Landry? I need them before the 11:00. Right away, sir. Of course. Thanks. So... back from rehab? Ooh, yep. Is that dog hair? Be back in time for the 11:00. And I'm a vice president of something, and I have my own office, and I got a big chair and a coffee cup and a secretary who is completely afraid of me. I mean, I am a big damn deal. Oh, and you know what? Found out--getting a boob job, and I'm afraid of elevators. How was your day? - I had a pop-tart. - So sorry to barge in on you like this. I just need something to wear to this 11:00 something. I don't mean to make anything any weirder than they are between us. Do you think my bra's gonna show throw this? You do remember we broke up, right? Yeah, duh. Because I thought so before, and then back you came. I know, I know. I'll be out of here in just two seconds. Hey, by the way, what do I do? Something at Chapman & Funk. Yeah, I know something at Chapman & Funk. I was just at Chapman & Funk. Don't get mad at me. I tried a hundred times to take interest in your work, but every time I asked what you did, exactly, you spoke to me slowly like I was a monkey. There's no need to speak slowly to a monkey. I just know I'm gonna miss the cake. - Cake? - Birthday cake. To save the firm money, you suggested they ban employee birthdays. After that, we had a freezer full of confiscated cakes. God, I really hated birthdays. Or loved cake. I gotta get to this 11:00, but I'd love to hear more. And you know what? I don't mean to complain, but I just really feel like I am doing all the work in this breakup. Hey, Frank, I'm not really sure about this outfit. You know me. Is this me? - Yes, it is. - You didn't look. It's an improvement over the usual, I'd say. Really? How? Coco Chanel said that to avoid overaccessorizing, women should look in the mirror and remove one thing. With you, it was often your dignity. Oh, thank you for your honesty. Hey, should I get a boob job? - We're not friends. - Right. 20 floors. Okay, okay, okay. Thank you. Secretary, listen, I have ten seconds before this meeting. Now just don't ask me, but just tell me what... do we do? Exactly what we're told. I know that now. It won't happen again. No. Okay... Andrea! Andrea, listen. I'm about to fake my way through this meeting, okay? It would be really nice - if I just knew what it is-- - It's 11:00. Let's do it. - Let's do it. Just do it. - Just do it. No? Okay. Oh, sorry. Sorry. All right, let's get started. Anyone? Me. Yes, sir. I got us a city council hearing on that church property. - Anyone? - we have a C.R.A. meeting this week. They don't want us turning the retirement home into condominiums. - So what's our play? Zoning commission? - Community impact hearing. Real estate! Ha! It's... it's what we do. Rehab. She's not used to her own serotonin. No, no, no, I know what Sam means. "Real estate--it's what we do." Get it? Not having meetings, not negotiating, but taking real estate and developing it so the city we love is the best it can be. Am I right, Sam? - Yeah, yeah, very. - Great. - So how do we get rid of the church? - What? Don't get rid of a church! She's right. We add a church. There's a mini-mall next door. We buy it, move in a made-up church, say that church wants to expand. That's great, Sam, because the council can't take sides in a religious dispute. - No, I didn't say to buy a mini-mall. - We don't need to. I get it. We lease a storefront. We put a sign in the window that says "immigration department." Whole place empties out. We pick it up for nothing. Now we are talkin'. I don't even know why I'm running this meeting anymore. Would you look at Sam? Check it. She comes right back. She's clean as a whistle. Sharper than ever. Claws out. Anyone you does not sign up for rehab is fired. Now I need some new ideas on my desk by midnight, so maybe we'll think about sneaking out of here early. Great meeting. Well... this job sucks. Knock, knock! You do know that saying "knock, knock" isn't actually knocking, right? - What were you looking at? - Nothing. Are you curious about your body? No, I'm not curious about my body. I'm just... I'm trying to understand why I would want a boob job. - Well, let me see. - No! God, no. They're nothing I haven't seen a thousand times before. I made them, for heaven's sakes. Come on. Open up. - Knock, knock. - Oh, jeez! Jiminy Christmas. Can you just go? 'Cause I have to get dressed. There's nothing wrong with your breasts. They are great. And they're gonna stay great. You know why? because you have the genes. - Here, look at these. - No! Stop. Just, it's not about if I need a boob job. It's just about... It's just about who I am. I found out what I do for a living today, and I really don't like it. - So quit. - I can't quit. And do what? I don't even know how to do what it is that I do do. Don't tell her to quit her job. How is she gonna get insurance? Howard, go away! Listen, I know. First thing tomorrow morning, we'll go down to that new game store that Marjorie Law opened with the money the city gave her from when the fireworks came down on her head. It's called "I'm game if you are." Huh? She's getting a new jigsaw puzzle. I don't wanna do a puzzle. I am a puzzle. When I was a little girl, what did I dream of doing? - Puzzles. - Okay, and we will do puzzles. I just think that right now I should be finding out what is that I love. - Well, not me. That's for sure. - Oh, for God sakes. - No, you hate me. It's fine. - We will do puzzles, okay?! It's just... you're the one who said this morning that this is a new life, and maybe I should have a new life that I want. Well, maybe you should. I don't know. All I know is that this morning you didn't have any time for me because you were trying to find out who you were, and now you don't have any time for me because you're trying to find out who you are. From where I sit, this new life looks a lot like the old one because neither one includes me. So have fun tonight and... wear a short skirt. It'll take attention away from your chest. You are my hero. No, you are. You're really just gonna quit? - No. - Maybe. - Am I crazy? - Yes. And here you are. What would you do, anyway, if you quit? Well, she can do whatever she wants. You could do whatever you could dream of in the whole world. You could rescue newfies. You could, uh, oh! Oh! - No, that's all I got. - Newfies. How'd she get in here, really? Is there no one at the door? No, no, no. She's right. I can do whatever I want. I mean, I can write. I could paint. I could open up a cupcake shop or a coffee shop or even a coffee shop that has cupcakes. - That one. Do that. - Okay. The point is, is that this thing happened to me-- - this near death experience. - Oh, my God. When? - Oh! When I got hit by a car. - Oh, that, yeah. Okay, go on. Anyway, if things happen for a reason, then what was the reason, right? Maybe it's that I'm supposed to do something important in my life, like improve the world, help the little people. What little people? Dwarves? The dwarves are fine. Or maybe just not be unhappy with what I do. I mean, come on, Andrea. Do you really, really love what you do? I don't know. Who cares? But if everyone asked if they love what they do, the economy would collapse by morning, and how is that helping the dwarves? I'm doing it. I'm quitting. Oh, God! That feels so right. I don't know why I didn't do this before. I'm sorry. I guess your credit card is declined. What's that about? $30,000 in credit card debt? I mean, how does this happen? Would it help if I said you bought me a kidney? No, I'll tell you how this happens. Hair. Makeup. Nails. You know what? Mostly shoes. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Was I hoarding shoes? I mean... was the country converting to some sort of shoe-based currency? I mean, God! I know what I'm gonna do. I'll take them all back. Yep, that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take 'em back. They have to take 'em back, right? I mean, some of these haven't even been worn. And then I can pay off this debt, and I can quit that stupid job, and I can follow my dreams and help the dwarves. - What about these? - No, not those. Those are really cute. - Sam-- - No, listen, listen. I can do this. I can do this, all right? Just tell me, where do I keep the receipts? You'll find them in the matching purses. Stupid "old me." Old me really screwed new me over, didn't she? How am I supposed to start fresh when my past just keeps reaching into my future and pulling me into my present? That's very true. And now I can't quit my job, and I have to work. It is so unfair. - Unfair how? - That I have to work so I can pay my bills so that I can make money! Okay, so it sounded a lot more unfair in my head than it did out loud. - And who are these... dwarves? - Ugh! Never mind. Anyway, no, no dwarves, no writing, no painting, no cupcakes. Then I guess a boob job is out of the question. More where that came from, mister. Here's my thought. - I think you're gonna like it. - I think I'm gonna love it. Okay, so now I haven't gotten all the details worked out, but when I, um... when I was in rehab, we had these amazing speakers, and there was this one guy. He was very, very wealthy. Now I mean, I can't tell you his name 'cause of the whole anonymous thing, but he said that the secret to success is to do what the other guys don't. So instead of getting rid of that church-- are you ready? We don't. Not sure I follow. What we do is we start to get the name Chapman & Funk associated with... - The poor. - Yes! Yes, helping the poor. No, being poor. Have you lost your mind? No! Yeah--yes. No, listen. Or what we do is we don't do development. We, um, diversify. Open a bakery. 'Cause, you know, people love cupcakes. Okay, shh. Listen. This rehab of yours-- I do not know what they took out of your system, but right now I want you to stand up. I want you to go back there, and I want you to pay whatever it takes to just shove that crap right back in your mouth. - Okay. - Good meeting. - Didn't go so well, huh? - He's an ass. So? You used to know how to play him. Next time you go in there, you just smile, open a button or two. I'm not gonna open-- Oh, my God. I can't believe you walk up 20 flights of stairs every morning. I admire that. Yeah, it keeps me strong and two sizes below my body's natural comfort level. You should try it. Do you have the reports? I need you to start redoing my new office today. Have the painters come in first thing so that there are no fumes tomorrow. You can sleep in there tonight to make sure it's safe. Thank you! What are you doing in my office? You didn't hear? I got it for Landing Sternwood properties. Sternwood is mine. How did you-- Oh, you did not. Chapman didn't fall for a move that cheap. Whose idea do you think these were? Excuse me. I have to get something off my chest. All right, maybe I wasn't clear. What I meant to say was that be both know that you have encouraged and rewarded at least one woman here to have her boobs done. So if you ever talk to any woman in this company about any body part ever again, by the time you and I are out of court, this place is gonna be called Chapman, Funk and Newly. Or just Funk and Newly. Newly and Funk. Either way. All right, so just bottom-line it for me. The church stays? It's a start. One more thing. Happy birthday, dear... Tracy... Happy birthday to you... So you're telling me that your secretary's birthday just happens to be today? No, no, but I had to send a message, and, of course, she was like, "no, no, no, I can't do that," and I said, "look, girlie, do I have to command you to have a good time? "So eat a piece of cake. Have two pieces of cake." Poor thing. - She's diabetic, you know. - Oh, for heaven's sake. No, spit, spit. - Oh, hi. - Hi. Back to work, I see. Yep. I'm a workin' girl. Not like a hooker. Something... like that. - There's an edge piece. - Yeah, I saw it. You know, it doesn't have to be all work. I mean, I hear those 80-hour weeks-- they can be hard on other stuff, too... like friends and family. And it doesn't have to be forever. But people work, right? And I think that I can do some good over there. - In a lot of debt, huh? - Just do the puzzle. I had this dream, and I woke up clean and white as snow, my debts forgiven and my sins all washed away. That sounds awesome! But it's a bunch of crap. I mean, yesterday can't be unlived. It's part of today. We drag it along like a big old dog. Today is all we can control. We do today right, we may even have a shot at tomorrow. By the way, I'm not gonna get that boob job. No? Good. Then you really should start sleeping in a bra.
