You know, um, in some countries it's actually considered rude To ignore messages after someone has left 20 or 30 of them.

I just don't remember us, which i--is a shame, Because, um, I'm guessing it was good. It wasn't r.e.o. speedwagon, but yeah. So I'm--i'm sorry. I just can't. Well... Oh! hey, you know, But if you're in the marrying mood, I can refer you to a dynamite brunette-- No. it's cool. I should go. I should probably give this back to you. Don't want to, but there you go. And if andrea finds out that I had A relationship with this guy, she is gonna kill me. I mean, I accidentally ate her yogurt the other day, And she bent back all my fingers.

Okay, okay, now you take a picture of me and your dad With the car! They say that a diverse portfolio will protect you In a bumpy real tate market, But this company thrives on risk. And if the market goes south, we'll go north. trust me. I can sell snow to an eskimo. -What the hell was that? -what? -That giggle. -nothing. No, it's nothing. it was the joke, 'cause you know, Cause, you know, an eskimo wouldn't have to buy snow. What is going on with you and Funk? Nothing! nothing!

And if you fell off the face of the earth, -I wouldn't even care. -good! There is more billionaires for me. Andrea stormed out of the bathroom She even had a little piece of toilet paper on her shoe, And I didn't tell her. I really think that this lationship is completely over. Oh, pish posh. Contretemps and discord are always to be expected Between friends with fiery natures. You are gonna stop talking like this When you're finished with your book, right? one does hope so.  Uh, excuse my interruption. Are you miss Newly? Yes, it is i. ah... Yes, I am. Mr. Funk is outside in his car and was wondering If you'd care to join him. Well... tell him thank you very much, But the answer is no, I would not care to join him. I would care for him to leave me alone... And that's what i... would care for. -As you wish. -thank you. Madam. "abandoning all chance of happiness, "the heroine rebuffed the advances "of the mysterious prince, "even though there was no hope with the stableboy, "and her evil friend, androgyna, Had been trampled by oxen." You know what? Forget Todd. Screw Andrea. You know what? I can do whatever the hell I want. And with that, the heroine ran like the wind To the prince's chariot. Please don't write what I do before I do it. -It's just creepy. -and still she ran! Stop it! Okay. Okay what? Okay. I mean, you seem nice enough, So... why not? Are you saying you'll marry me? No, I'm-- no, I'm saying that, You know, maybe, uh, you can buy me coffee sometime-- A cup, not a franchise. I smell cupcakes. Are you so rich that you smell like cupcakes? Yes, I am. no. Roger's wife bakes cupcakes... And someone's bad at sharing. Anyway, here's what I'm thinking. We should go... Are you going to see chapman? I am not gonna take stonehouse's workload Just because his baby came early, and it's not my fault. I didn't ask his wife to do a 10k for cancer. Listen, do me a favor when you're in there. Tell him I am the perfect person for the job in new york. yeah, but then you'll be gone, And I'm gonna be left here alone. No! you'll come visit. it's new york. it'll be fun. Come on. All right. Get 'em! ooh! Now I know why you're here, Newly. What--what do you want me to do? The stonehouse kid weighs, like, 2 pounds. don't give Andrea the promotion. Wow. did not see that coming. You girls--you see? That's why kittens can't share the same ball of yarn. And I like it. I just think that she's too valuable... To the company, I mean. Done. Thanks. What'd he say? i... I tried my best, But he just-- he doesn't wanna lose you. That is so not fair! He is so selfish! I know. I know you're bummed. But, I know someone who needs a trip To the sweet sugar bake shop, huh? -Let's get you a cupcake. -there's a soccer game in madrid This weekend which you might enjoy. I've only owned the team a year. I thought if I bought a team, I might not find soccer so dull. But no! i, um, can't do this right now. -What? -I gotta go. Wait, forget the soccer. We'll just go get a hot dog or somethin'. No. i... I just have to take care of something. rain check?  yeah, s-sure. Thanks. I can walk from here. Roger will take you wherever you wanna go. Thank you. Thanks. Hey, roger, do you know someplace Called the sweet sugar bake shop? I, uh, remembered that we would-- We would come here when we wanted to feel better. Uh... I don't remember why, But... Look, I don't care if you hate me. No, no. you know what? I do care. Because best friends aren't supped to hate each other. I mean, best haters? who wants that, right? I know that I should've told you earlier about Winston, But it--it just means that I was so scared to lose you... Kind of like how you lost me when I came out of the coma-- A completely different person. I'm sorry that I never-- I never thought about how hard that must be on you. But, you know... I'm not gone. I'm here, I guess, If you want... me. We sit here to smell the cupcakes. It's like eating them but with none of the calories. Um, one more thing. kinda funny, actually. Uh, do you remember that job That you wanted in new york so badly? Yeah. Yeah. I kinda sabotaged it. You did? But it was only because I didn't wanna lose you. I-i'm really sorry. Yeah, well, i... I sort of killed a job for you in l.a. Really? Yeah. You did that for me? We really do care about each other. And our heroine realize ...that even as she waited for "happily ever after," Her friends would keep her company during the wait-- Friends-- And also a ration of the sweet cakes That came in the cups. And so the beautiful, beautiful amnesiac Decided to sit out for a chapter And let the other characters do whatever the hell they want. She was tired. "snap, then shake." Todd. What are you doing here? Who is this guy? Huh? are you kidding? Oh. nice shot, mom. Maybe next time you can give me two more chins. So who is he Just some billionaire who wants to marry me. no biggie. I mean, look at this. unbelievable. I mean, just yesterday, you wanted me back in your life, And now you're all over town with this guy. Um, you said that you never wanted to see me again.
