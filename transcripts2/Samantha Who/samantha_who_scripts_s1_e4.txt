This happens to every woman once a month. No,that's not it. It's about having sex. oh,good. The cookies are done. It's not something that we discuss,I take it. Well... it--it's just that you never brought it up before. Your father and I agreed that if you ever did bring it up, that we would call it something else,like "the happy touch." Okay,well,last night I realized that the next time I do... the happy touch will be the first time that I do the happy touch. Well,there's no need to rush into it. The first time isn't that nice. First time for what? The happy touch. Oh,the special hug. You know, your first time was nice. Your first time was great. -Oh,how do you know? You weren't even there. Well,of course I was there. You were my first time,and I was yours. Of course you were,honey... right after bob mcnally. You mean that spindly guy from the shoe store? What are you saying to me? Great talk. I gotta go. The man handled the feet of strangers. Note to self:NEVER Talk to Mom about sex AGAIN So what do you not know what to do or where things go? I know where they go. I just don't.. I don't remember them... you know... going there. You know? I don't... know how it feels. I just,I just I don't remember what it's like. What it's like? It's like,um...it's like... it's like,you know,it's like sex. It really is. You,you can't describe it. -Well,just try,okay? I mean,you know,sometimes people describe food like,"it tastes like chicken." - I will tell you this. It tastes nothing like chicken. - Most of the time. Look,you just need to go out and experience it. You just need to go out and do it. Well,what's the hurry? She should wait for the right guy. Better idea: why don't you go wait for him and call us when he gets here,huh? No,she's right. She's right. Why why do I have to rush into this? Because it's weird. You are a grown woman who doesn't know anything about sex. I mean,no wonder your mother treats you like a child. You are child. Childhood is nice. You get to order off the children's menu. they always have grilled cheese. All right,you guys are making a big deal about this,all right? This is not some sort of infirmity,okay? It's not like I've lost the ability to walk. Wait till you have good sex. Look,you are an adult human woman. So much of who you are is tied up in sex. Maybe if you go and you have it for the first time,maybe all of your memories will just come rushing back,huh? That,or she'll... wake up with cotton candy stuck to her back and a long walk home. The sugar? Okay,you know,I don't I don't even wanna talk about this anymore,okay? I have plenty of time to re-experience things,and I will get to sex when I get to it.

I just wanna get enough clothes, you know,so I don't have to keep coming back and grabbing stuff, and we've had sex before,haven't we? -I'm sorry. What? -Sex? Well,yeah,you know,I mean, we were together for three years. I know we have. Of course we have. Uh,it's just... um... -what? -Can't remember it. Oh,well,that's flattering. No,no,no,please don't take it personally. I don't remember french fries,either. So... I just--I don't know. Um... what--was it... -what? -Was it good? Yeah? Very. Really? I know. Okay,then. You good? Yeah! Pfft. Good. I'm good can't wait to try french fries. yeah,yeah,we get it. How are you today? -How am I? I'm a virgin. That's how I am. Yes,ma'am,and I'm a pirate. Should I call you a cab?

Well,if you didn't want me to read your diary,you wouldn't have left it out. I didn't tell your father,though. It would've killed him. -you never told me a lot of things! -Howard! Knock it off! -What is going on over there? -Nothing. My mother's in my bed. And you wonder why you have issues. Okay, look,just come out with me tomorrow night. Don't think about it. It'll all come back to you. Trust me,it's just like riding a bike. oh,gosh,look,it's closed. We gotta go. -Oh,no,no,no, You want this to happen, or you wouldn't have come. It was an absolute mistake.

I really don't think that I should be your first. -Why not? Because you're old? -No. Because... you know,you're you're a nice guy,and I think that your first should should not be with a stranger. It should be with someone who you,I don't know,who you connect with, who you have some sort of history,you know? Just someone who you... someone who cares about you. Oh,man. Wait. Let's do it in the hall. I like it when the old lady next door glares at me in the morning. Oh,I don't think so. Um,listen Sam I like you look,you don't have to say that to get me in bed. The deal was sealed when I stuffed my underwear in your pocket. No,I mean,I like you a lot. -Okay,well,let's do it a lot. -No,I'm being serious. Oh,right,I'm sorry. I'll put on my serious face. look,uh, my mistake,I know,but I guess I care about you. Sue me. And if we do this,I'm gonna care about you even more, and if you don't feel the same,it's fine, but then let's not. You are such a girl. And you're a pain in the ass. Okay. Yeah? But you know that speech? -Yeah? That better not be the longest thing that you do tonight. Hey,you okay? You didn't,like, have stroke,did you? Because my grandma did that,and it was -no! No,look,I have to go,all right? Don't hurry,okay? The right person,just wait for that right person. He is out there. He? You know,"she," whatever, 'cause I don't judge. Sleep with Todd hey. Um,can I talk to you for just a second? Um,look,I just wanted to say that that you and I have known each other for a long time, and,you know,we can't just forget those years,right? I mean,I can,and I already have, but I hear that they were good, and maybe not all of them, but I know that it started out well, and how often do you connect with people on that level? Well,you know, you you've got that closetwith the lighting and the mirror and everything, so I was just wondering if you-- -Todd,who is it? -Oh,um... just Sam. Hi. Hi. What's going on ? This is julia. -I'm--I'm gonna go start the movie. -Yeah,you do that. Yeah,I'll be there in a second. what is going on with you? Nothing. Pfft. Nothing. I just came by to say hi. That's all. Can't I come by and--and--and say hi? -Sure. Hi. So she,um,she seems nice. She's very pretty. Oh,thanks. I didn't say you were pretty. I said she was pretty. -Have you been drinking? -Why? Have you? No,I'm not the one acting strange. Well,I'm not the one with a girl in my apartment. So I'm not supposed to see other people? Why--why would I care if you saw other people,todd? I don't have feelings for you. you didn't understand that? -Well,you're acting very jealous. -Jealous? Um,how is it possible to be jealous of someone you can't remember,huh? Hmm? Answer? It's not. Okay,you know what? I really gotta go. Yeah,so do I, 'cause you know what? It's almost midnight,and that's my... curfew. bye,michelle. -It's... julia. -Whatever. Ms. Newly. Hey,frank. Guess what? I'm not a virgin anymore. And apparently not a cuddler. Sleep ALONE Hi. I'll sleep downstairs. -Nonsense. Come on. Come here. I shouldn't have gone to that place tonight. I guess I just wanted us to be better at talking about things,this time around. Well,thanks. Me,too. Just don't ever come there again. What happened with that boy? -Nothin'. -Oh,I'm sorry. No,I'm not. I'm not sorry at all. I'm glad. Like it or not,you'll always be my little girl. And the truth is,I want you to save yourself for someone special. -Or just throw yourself at a shoe salesman! Howard,shut up. I only did it with bob mcnally in the first place because I didn't wanna act like an idiot when I met the man I love. You know,dad,if it means anything she did try to hook me up with a guy who looks like you. Is that true ? At least someone's doing it around here, and,hey,I did remember what it was like. It was like,um, well,it definitely was not like chicken, and I will probably do it again when the right guy comes around. And now I know that they do. when it does happen though... I will definitely be ready. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- sync:?????? Samantha Who Season01 Episode05
