 My name is Mike Hall. Over the last 40 years, against better judgment, I've managed to amass over 400 classic cars. These cars are my legacy. But I'm running out of time to restore them all. So I opened up a restoration shop, with my son, Connor, and my best friend, Avery, to try and turn my passion into profit. Restoring cars that the average person can afford. But it's tough making a buck, so I'm going to have to get the whole car-crazed town behind me

 to help get the job done. But that's how things roll here in Rust Valley. Going up! Oh, she's a heavy pig. Hang on. Okay, keep her over a bit. Tractor! That was almost too easy. First year running the shop, I didn't have a very good year. I mean, we built some amazing cars, but my finances took a shit-kicking. Get! In a desperate attempt to dig himself out of a hole, Mike listed his yard and his entire collection of 400 classic cars for sale. I've had a couple of people nibbling. I've sold a few cars, but I'm not ready to give it away.

 The weather's warming up, spring's coming, people are calling. I'm getting my mojo back. We're on to a new start. Hopefully this year will be a lot better. We're going to try it one more time. What could go wrong? - What are we looking for today? - Something easy. Mike, Connor, and Avery are prowling Mike's Field of Dreams on the hunt for the perfect restoration project. What about this one? This one's pretty rare. This is a Utility Sedan. In 1955, Chevy made 17,000 of these, and this one was a factory V8 car. I need a win. I need a win to start, not halfway through the season. I need a win right out of the gates. It's literally the first car we looked at. Okay, let's keep going. How about an El Camino? This one's... We also don't need to choose the second car we walk by. Okay... Start of the year, crunch time. It's been a long winter. We have no money coming for months. First big build of the year, let's do it right. What about the Pontiac? We've walked by it 100 times. Four-doors are worth less cuz they're family cars, but it sure is mint. ****. This piece was here. I find that highly unlikely. I think the lights were here too, but I'm not sure. There's some headlights missing. Then there's some chrome missing. People are taking our stuff! Or possibly Mike sold them and forgot about it. I don't know if shit's going missing, but I don't remember seeing this piece missing. I guarantee stuff goes missing. - If we want to build that '56... - You gotta buy that. ...I gotta buy those things. There's gotta be an easier one, buddy. There is an easier one. You have the most expensive workbench in Rust Valley. How long's it been sitting out? Four years, five years? - Six years, seven years. - Six years? We can take a look if you want. We can mount that right there. Two dollars for the bolts and 55,000 for the bench. It's a rolling bench, eh, Connor? I can't think of anyone else in the world that will have a '68 ragtop Camaro used as a workbench. Ever since it got pushed into that shop, it's had tools on it. It's the world's most expensive tool bench. It's stupid. Here's what the car looked like when I bought it. It was a '68 Firebird that I bought for 2,000 bucks. Now, it's a '68 RS/SS Camaro clone. It was a Firebird, but the basic car is exactly the same dimensions. The only difference is the bumpers, and the sheet metal. We cloned it as a big-block RS/SS Camaro. As we like to say, the "Famaro," or the "Cambird," one of the two. What do you like, Famaro or Cambird? - They both suck. - I'd like it sold. That's what I'd like. But, Firebird or Camaro, this is one of the most popular muscle cars ever made. Depending on who you ask, the word "Camaro" either means "camaraderie and friendship," or "a vicious animal that eats Mustangs." More luxurious and powerful than the Firebird, the Camaro arrived late on the muscle car scene, but shocked the world when it dominated Trans-Am racing in 1968. It's been like a black hole ever since I started it. - How much have you spent on this car? - It's got to be pushing 50 grand. Look, there's Teeter Core, there's door seals, there's rubber. He's ashamed of how much money he's put into it. You might even say it's become a personal demon for him. Is that a spare crossmember, too? Did you need two? I don't remember what that's for. "I don't know what this $1,000 is for." Mike... It has to end. Maybe I just don't want to throw any more money at it. - It depresses me. - But you can't not finish it. What's it worth finished, 60, 70? - Should be. - It's an RS/SS rag. - And it's a Big Block, it's a standard. - Yeah. It needs to go. - If we had a battery, we could fire it up. - I bet it sounds good. Every time I've touched it, it's cost me thousands, and it never seems to get any closer. It's time. This is a better sheet than you got in your house, Mike. - Cleaner, anyways. - Cleaner. - This is a 427... - No, it's a 454, just with 427... A ZZ454 crate. When it's done, I'm gonna have 500 horse, five-speed stick, four-wheel disc brakes, little extra chrome, hideaway headlights, fancier interior, it's going to feel amazing. - Keep spraying it. - I don't feel like having - this bottle light on fire. - It won't light on fire. Do you know how many times I've watched you guys blowing fire out of carburetors? Yeah, fire it up. That was a pretty quick start. It sounds nasty. It's going to be a scary little car. That give you any idea what kind of mileage it's gonna give? Very poor. You know what they call that? Smiles per gallon. Here we go. Cassidy, you want to come over and give me a hand pulling these seats out? Mike's got his old crew back, racing to finish the Camaro in time for Rust Valley's summer kickoff car show, just six weeks away. It's going in that show, and it's going to be ready. Pluck that baby out. There's going to be lots of people, lots of nice cars, and lots of money. Mike, how are you? - I'm Gregg. - Glad to meet you. So, how can I help you? Mike has his first potential client of the year. More clients, more business. Hopefully, more business, more money. I really need a 1970 Coronet Super Bee. When my youngest daughter, Amanda, was little, I had another Super Bee. We just used to mess with it, it was kind of our thing to do as a dad thing. Circumstances, we had to get rid of it, and I promised her we would mess with the car again. So... It was a big part of our past. I can't guarantee it, but I might know where there's a Bee for sale. - We're going to track one down. - Thank you. Ave, we're heading to Russell's. 1970 Super Bees, they only made about 12,000 of them, give or take. This Bee is going to be more than a car to Gregg. I'm going to try and get him his Bee and build him his dream car. The Dynamic Duo! How's it going? Told you we'd stop by one day. How you guys doing, you crazies? - How you doing? - Jesus! I got something for you, it's a ram. Should put that on the hood of your truck. - Full curl. - It's the full curl ram, bro. - That's worth money, you know? - Three thousand bucks, it's yours. This was an old sheep. Russell's a Mopar freak. He's got a lot of cool stuff. He has a lot of expensive stuff. That's why Russell's a tough guy to deal with. Russ, the Bee I sold you last year... - Is it restored yet? - No. - Where is it? - Over in my barn. It's changed a little bit since the last time you saw it. - For the worse or for the better? - Depends how you look at it. Nice windshield you put in it! Open her up, Mike. Last fall... - How much do you want for this? - Fifteen grand. - Fifteen grand, you're not out of hand. - No. ...Mike sold Russ a 1970 Coronet Super Bee, and now, he wants it back. He's owned this car once, he made some money on it, now he wants it back. I don't know what's going through Mike's mind, I think he's absolutely insane. Roof looks good. Fenders are good. - Thing's running and driving already. - No need to look in there. - What do you mean? How do you beat... - Whoa! Where's the 440, Russ, and the 727? I was going to put a Hemi in it, that was my plan. I need the car. I tell you what I would do. I would agree to give you back the car and the parts, with a catch. - Watch out here. - Here, I'll just roll under. - There you go, Avery. - I know how the farmers do it. Where we going, Russ? - We're going over here. - You've got a babbling brook. A babbling brook is what I got. Here's the rock that I do not want. Look at this rock that's gotta get out of here, man. It is a big "M"-er "F"-er. - That's a nice **** nugget, Russ. - I can't go around it. I can't cut the trees. I want it out of here. It's in my way. There's not a machine made that could move this. If you want the car, this thing's got to go. If Mike can blast this rock into gravel, Russ will sell him the Bee. - What kind of rock is it, Mike? - A big one. That rock is like 75,000 pounds of terra firma. I've spent, off and on, 40 years hanging on ropes, blowing shit up. There are some risks, but I really want the car. If we can get this done then we got a deal. There's very few people that actually blow themselves up. What do you think? - I'm not gonna blow smoke up your ass. - Let's make the deal. I can't believe this. That is what we call a "BFR." - Big **** Rock? - Big **** Rock! - Is that a real, live stick of dynamite? - Yeah. That's dynamite. How small do you need it? I want to be able to put it in this pocket. **** off! Mike made a deal with his neighbor, Russ, to blow up this giant boulder, in exchange for a 1970 Super Bee. We have a client for the Bee. I know he's serious, I know he's got cash, but that rock's over 20 cubic meters. That is a big friggin' rock, man. Both Mike and Connor are certified blasters. Guys, what are a few safety precautions for this? Uh, do not shoot guns at the dynamite. Don't step on it. No smoking. That's it. Okay, let's go. Less talk, more rock. Been doing it my whole life, but this boulder's a big deal. You gotta do it safe because there's lives on the line. Give me that **** anchor. I'm in line with where I want to be. But if you don't drill, you're not going to blow anything up. If you were to place dynamite on the outside of the rock, it's not going to do anything. We want to put the dynamite as close to the center of the rock as possible so it gets the most effect to break the rock apart. Holy ****. Has it been a while? Think you're tougher than a jackhammer? Nobody's tougher than a jackhammer. Okay, Ave, we'll get you to start one. Oh, let's make some hole, boys! Little bit of throttle. Holy ****. Hey, Avery, toss me one of those! No, here's how you throw a stick of dynamite. See? You get it? No, right in the middle. Perfect. - Let's not **** play around. - Let's not play with dynamite. Okay, spacer. Third of a stick. You don't want to hurt anybody, or kill anybody. There is rules you gotta follow. There's a busy highway just 15 meters from the rock. We're going to try to aim it away from the road and push the whole blast towards the forest side. Seven, eight, nine, ten. One on the front, 11. Four pounds. - Whatever. - It'll be fine. It'll be fine. Blast is going to go in two minutes. Copy that, Mike. Traffic control shuts down the road. - Okay, everybody back. - One minute. - Everybody keep their heads up. - If you see the sky turn black, - get underneath somebody bigger than you. - Russ, do you want to whack this? - Absolutely. - Smack it hard. Five, four, three, - two, one... - I love Mopars! **** cool, man! Just wait. Blasters, go and check. That scared the shit out of me. That was crazy. It was like watching the shuttle go off. Look at the... Still got the dust clearing. ****. This shit was slate. All clear, let 'em rip. Russ, is it out of the way? This is nice and light now, man. This is perfect. Those guys are pro. It was a textbook demolition. Right on! That's how things work here. Give and take, and take and give. It was a good deal. You've got some nice rock here, man. You need to build yourself a fireplace or something out of it. You take three, then you set the one on top and make a table. Watch out! - Push. - Mike is once again the proud owner of a 1970 Super Bee. Gregg really wants to surprise his daughter, so, I'm pretty sure, with the parts we have and what we can get, I should be able to put this car together and make it complete for him. Fenders are good, doors are good, quarter skins have been done. Roof doesn't look bad. He's got about 40K to spend, give or take. Forty K, Mike? It's about a $60,000 car when it's done. Yeah, well, we already made kind of a deal. This year, I'm supposed to be the new shop manager. It's not that I'm a professional at doing it, but we did it Mike's way last year, and lost nothing but money. - There, how does that tell you? - Okay, it needs an exhaust. - Exactly. 40K? - Whatever, we'll see. I'll prove to him that there's money in this business. I'm here to shake things up a little this year. We told the client it would be done at the end of the month. He knows he's getting a smoking deal, so... he's happier than a kid in a candy store. Look how thin that meat is in there. If I wanted a bread sandwich, I'd have one. Like ****. Better than nothing, I guess. A week later... Avery and Mike's part-time mechanic, Dave Schwandt, are installing the engine on the Super Bee. Look at this. There's oil leaking down here from somewhere. I don't know where it's from, but it's leaking. To find the source of the leak... I hate this **** one. ...they have to pull the transmission. Is there a **** chunk of chain to hold that transmission with that balanced the way it is? Get down, Charlie Brown. Just wait. No oil coming from the bottom of the pan, I think, eh? Right here it's leaking real bad. The oil's not even hot yet. Once the oil gets hot, it'll pour out of there. Looks like somebody did a **** tap dance on it. The motor should be... Broke the **** transmission. Isn't that a ****? My new role this year is to keep things under control. And it's... It's off to a bad start already. It's more embarrassing than anything. It's all bad. - We should've put a chain over it. - A chain or a strap on it. Mike's got four of them right over here. - That one's fairly used. - But is he using it for something? Cuz you know what he's **** like. He'll go sideways. It's like, "There is only 343 of those transmissions ever made, and I've got 300 of them. God knows, somebody else might need it." What's up? That green Super Bee, Mike... We need to find a transmission for it. Say what? The transmission case is broken. We dropped it on the floor. How the **** did you drop it on the floor? I just spent 1,000 bucks on that. - It was brand-new. - It's not new anymore, but the parts are still there, it just needs a case. The engine's leaking like a sieve, the oil pan's **** on it, and the rear main seal I think is leaking. Why, did you drop that too? Not yet. Give me and Dave another half-hour. - Gregg speaking. - I got good news and bad news. What do you want? Give me the bad news, and then the good. Avery, shop manager. Clumsy carp. Mike's first job of the year has already gone sideways. What happened is, somebody slipped, dropped the tranny and broke it in half. Oh, no. No one got hurt, I hope. No, no one got hurt, but it's gonna be another... We're thinking of the tenth. The good news is, you're getting a rebuilt 727 at no extra charge. Now I have to delay him another week. The guy's already paid 20,000 upfront. He wants his car. I should know better than to give a hard deadline on a muscle car project. Mike, I appreciate that. Thank you so much for everything. Bye-bye. That went better than I expected. While he waits for the transmission rebuild, Mike sends the Bee in for paint. Again, I gave a price before the car was finished. It's coming back to haunt me, but I'll stick with my word. I just want to make him happy, and it's going to make me happy. - Hey, guys. - Hey. Show me what we got going on the Famaro. - Problems. - Of course there's problems. Check this out. What have we got there? - Five. - What have we got here? - We got six. - It's out an inch. - It's out an inch. - Yeah. - It's out one inch. - That's not good enough for 500 horse. Mike's troubles are far from over. The '68 Camaro's expensive rear end is out of alignment. This whole diff is pushed over this way. It's crooked-er than a dog's hind leg. It's a drag car, semi-floater rear end setup. But whoever installed this kit, they messed up. The guy wasn't measuring. It's almost like he just put it there, eyeballed it and looked down his... It was ten years ago. - Doesn't matter. - Still wrong. That's a lot of parts and time and money I spent were basically... for nothing. Now, if we slap a nine-inch in it with a posi that'll handle 500 horse... - Then we're good to go. - ...we're good to go. Okay, let's go with the other one. We just get rid of it, put a 12-bolt in it, Bob's your uncle, car's finished. Just, uh... Like, holy ****. Mike heads to the Field of Dreams to hunt for a replacement rear end. Every time I've touched this car it costs me, and it never seems to get any closer. Where did we put that thing? I know it sat over here for three years. - But he can't find it. - How you doing? Wait a sec. What did I throw under here? This is... No, yes, no. ****. Did I sell it? Somebody's been down there, and stuff is going missing. Somebody's ripping me off. Without a replacement... We're gonna cut it off and move it? ...Mike will have to spend time and money fixing the rear end they already have. Where that line is, is where it needs to come off. Avery, you got your goggles? When I add up how much money I've got in that thing, it makes me cry. No matter what it cost, it's got to get finished. You gotta spend money to make money. Sometimes you gotta spend money to lose money, but you always gotta spend money. Rock 'n' roll. Look at the **** meat in there. Oh ****, that's good. Things are looking up for Avery. That's what a sandwich should look like. Not all **** bread. You notice the bread-to-meat ratio? The meat should always be thicker than the bread. Make a sandwich. There's two sandwiches there. No, thank you. After a few long days of overtime, the Super Bee's transmission has been replaced. - What needs to be done on it? - Not a lot, it should start today. Super Bee's almost finished. Motor's in it, paint's done. All we gotta do now is plug wires, get it fired up, get it out the door. Oh, wait. That's what I thought. - Who pulled this shit out of the box? - What are you looking for? I'm trying to cram a spark plug boot off an 8 mm wire onto an 8.5 mm wire. We got three boxes of plug wires floating around the shop, and not one is right for what we gotta do. We've used half of the kit so we can't send it back, so we end up paying for a kit we don't need. There's enough pieces to do it. It'll all work out fine. I know, we have pieces of three different kits. - It's not efficient, how we're doing that. - You're right, it's not. If I'd ordered the wires, we'd have got the right wires. I'm just saying. You come along and create a problem. - We've got three kits... - There's no problem, Mike. ...to make one set. I got a $6,000 bill at **** Lordco, - when you're trying to save me money. - You know what? Leave me the **** out of it. I was given the parts and that's what was in 'em. Take it up with somebody else. Being shop manager, the only difference as I see is everybody wants to kill me. He'll have to stay out of my face, or it won't work. - You're using the parts. Why not say... - I'm not the one that ordered them. - "Why is there three boxes of parts..." - I don't **** care. Shop manager, figure it out. - I know you don't care. - I have no say in nothing. Start **** caring! He's paid to be shop manager. Manage the shop, manage the builds, be on top of it. If he's not to blame, who is? You're the highest-paid guy here, you get the most shit. Yeah! Mike, what are we doing? We're going to drag the convertible up. Mike is up against the wall. Ow! - Ave, sorry. Grab the **** top. - Get it yourself. For **** sakes. The first car show of the year and the unveiling of his 1968 Camaro is just a day away. Okay, crank her hard, Gene. I got five guys here. We're busting our nuts. It's going to be done by tomorrow, come hell or high water. What are we doing to that thing today? What do you think we're doing with it? I think we should reassemble it, since it's going to a show tomorrow. - Maybe that could be a plan... - No, put the parts in the trunk and bring the car there. And we gotta put the roof on. Hopefully, Connor watched the video. There is no way we are getting this thing put together. - Should've been done a week ago. - I know, we don't have time. Anybody seen the Camaro book? This ought to be interesting. I'll start putting the motor for the top in. Restoration Handbook. Look, we have a book. "Convertible and vinyl tops, page 156," wow. A novel idea, eh, looking in a book for some information? ****. None of us have ever installed a convertible top. Apparently, it's an eight-hour job, if you know what you're doing. ****. "Convertible top, hydraulics." - We don't know what we're doing. - "Tack hammer with determination. Four wedge blocks made from pine." So, on page 160. It's looking good. I gotta prime the system up here. See it coming up now? It says the pump's supposed to have some grommets. ****. Do not hit that door. - Just close it a bit. - Just go up. - I'm going to go in. - Why don't you go up? Give me this. Let me get on this side. Okay, I'm assuming the long arm in your hand goes to the big bolt. There we go. Let's try not to wreck nothing. No, other way. It's alive! Everything seems to be lining up where it needs to go. It's looking pretty good. Whoa! ****. What? - We wrinkled the whole **** thing. - We bent it. Kinked right here. Hey, this side's actually broken. - **** snapped. - Look at that, it is too. I thought maybe that was a factory line, but it's busted. - It's busted. - This roof's ****. "We'll have it done in a few hours today," he says. It's like somebody kicked me between the friggin' legs. We've been dicking with this car for ten years. I've got to finish it. No más, like Roberto Duran, fighting Sugar Ray Leonard. "No más." Okay. We're going to scrap the idea of putting the roof on. We'll put it down, we'll get the tonneau on. Get the upholstery in, the carpet in, door panels. Forget about dicking with this, or we'll never have this car **** ready. Okay? So that's the plan. We're taking the car to the show with no convertible top. Open it. We're trying to sell the thing for 70,000 bucks, and it's not done. Let's button this baby up. I touched it, I got blood on it. After a brutal all-nighter... Like lipstick on a pig, eh? ...the crew... and the Camaro are heading to the first car show of the year. It doesn't matter how hard you try, you cannot buy time. It can go right beside. Maybe back it in, so you can see the nose of it. The Osoyoos Cactus Jalopies Car Show is about to begin. Open the back door, Ave. ****. It's all covered in dust and shit. The roof of the trailer, all the rust and shit in the ceiling's fallen out onto the car. Look at the dirt. - There's shit all over this thing. - Hey! Watch. Straight back. What a gong show. What a gong show. - What? - Connor, we need a vacuum. Fine. Have we got a sham? I am not a detail guy. - I don't want to **** this paint job. - Neither am I, - but we need to wash the dust off. - Don't, unless you know what you're doing. I do know one thing, - this rust has to come off... - Don't **** do that! - ...before it sets up. - You'll scratch the paint. - It's gotta come off, Mike. - Don't do it! - It needs to be loosened up. - Avery, leave the **** shit alone. - Wash it with water. - Mike, you need to take a deep breath. Yeah, "relax." It's not your car, it's my car. You relax. Mike! Here's your vacuum. How the **** does this thing work? That's about as useful as... Where's the other... Where's the adapter? Mike, that vacuum cleaner's a piece of ****. Mike is out of time. We dropped the ball. Hope you all appreciate the 650-car lineup. The Cactus Jalopies Car Show boasts big names, big money, and high-end builds. - Camaro? I'm like a Firebird guy. - This is a Firebird. - What? - It's in disguise. We figured, since it needed all the sheet metal, we were going to clone it as a Camaro. - I could see myself in this. - Yes. - How much? - Probably around 70 grand. Oof! I think it's too much for me. - Do you take a check? - A rubber one. You sure you don't want to buy it? What about this one? - Habitat For Humanity, Kamloops? - We're looking for a car for a raffle. Habitat For Humanity are on the hunt for a muscle car for a charity raffle. It'll enable us to help build affordable housing for veterans and seniors. How much is this one going for? - We're going to be thinking... - About 40? Forty grand won't pay the parts. There's 600 hours on this car, at shop rate. I know, Bill. Don't have a jammer on us. We were thinking closer to 80, but we're open to serious offers... - We did see other cars we liked. - Yes. We'll get the team together and have a chat... Get the team together and then get back to us. Let's go look at this other one. First year was a shit-show, and this Camaro was a shit-show. Not impressed. If there's an award for dirtiest car, we'll win hands down. Ugh. ****. Another **** Rust Bros win. I can't believe it. I want to see what size will fit. We'll try these sevens. Mike's second year in business is off to a bad start. Finish one thing before you start another. Didn't your mom ever tell you that? That's right, I know cuz I never finish **** all, and I start a million. Learn the hard way. No shit leaves the shop. That way a little bit. Yeah. His '68 Camaro was a flop at the car show. But he's determined to get it done right... - Good. - ...and invite the buyers from Habitat For Humanity back for a second look. - Now we got time to fix everything. - There's not a whole lot left. Famous last words. I got us parts. I should know better than to take a half-finished car to a show and expect to get top dollar. Habitat For Humanity are still looking for something to raffle off for charity. I know it's a long shot, but hopefully it blows these guys' socks off. - Hey, guys. - Hey, Michael. - Are you guys ready to look at it? - We are. Sounds good. Who's driving it? Get out of the way. Wow. If they buy something, it'll be something that sells a lot of tickets. Nothing's gonna sell tickets like a Big Block, five-speed Camaro Convertible. - What do you think, Bill? - Love it. Absolutely wonderful. There isn't a bad angle on this car. When I look at this car, you know what I see? Plywood on the back and a bunch of tools on it. We got our big fatties. Old school. What we've done to this car since the show at Osooyus, the brand-new, 12-bolt posi with four-wheel disc brakes. Lovely upholstery, all brand-new. The dash, we changed all the chrome. Convertible top is working. We've installed the Edelbrock fuel injection. It's just a beautiful piece. When you tromp on that thing, it gets up and it goes. - That's absolutely amazing. - Boggles the mind. Mike and his crew have done an amazing job. We did not expect to see what we have seen. I think it makes a statement. - Wanna play "let's make a deal"? - Well, I know I've added up my costs. How about 75K? We're a charitable society, Mike. - I know. - We are non-profit. Would you take 68? - Well, it is a '68. - See, there you go. Selling this car for the raffle would be a huge boost to my shop. - Make this happen, Mike, 68. - Okay, done deal. - Sold! - It's all yours, Bill. - Thank you, sir. - Guys, I want to ask you one favor. I'd like to take it for one little burn, if I may. Will you bring it back? - Do me a favor. - What? Don't fall in love with it. After 12 years, finally finishing this Camaro was like a big, giant weight has lifted off my shoulders. Be sure you bring it back! - Sounds good. - It does sound good. I know we look good in it. I spent tens of thousands of dollars, thousands of hours, gone forward, gone backwards, gone forward, gone backwards... - What you got, 110? - 100. There's lots left. It's done, it's sold. Sixty-eight thousand. Hopefully, they're going to sell $250,000-worth of tickets, and raise a lot of money for a very good charitable cause. - Thought you didn't like convertibles? - Today I do. "Today I do"! Whoever gets this car is going to be one happy individual. Avery, bring it out! A few days later, Mike's client, Gregg, is at the shop. Holy cow! Are you kidding me? - That is phenomenal. - It's time for him to take home his 1970 Super Bee. Don't run me over, or I'm not paying you. Look at the paint. Sublime green, incredible. I'm speechless, I don't know what to say. Holy cow. Just incredible. Happy, happy! Wow, it is fantastic. Check out that shiny white upholstery. Jeez, look at that. - Just mwah! - Oh. Let's check under the hood. Holy cow! 440 four-wheel, that's gorgeous. - Mopar Performance valve covers. - I don't know what to say. I'm speechless. It's incredible. My youngest daughter, she'll just go nuts. Say, "Dad, our Super Bee!" I know she is. Light her up! Holy Christmas! One more time. Hi, sweetheart! Nice car! Actually, it stalled. Give it some gas. **** is there any gas in it? - I think we're out of **** gas. - I think we're out of gas! I don't think they are. - That's okay, man. - Put it in neutral, let's push it in the yard. Don't scratch the paint. Try it again, Gregg, just to see. Maybe it was flooded. Let's open the hood. Okay, turn this thing over again. Whoa... That's all bad. Something's wrong with the distributor. - What the hell happened there? - Don't know. Okay. For some unknown reason, it just broke the end off the shaft. - Shit! - Got one somewhere? Why don't we go find one? **** me. The end of the distributor snapped off, and will have to be replaced. Everything was working perfect until the worst possible moment, when the client drives the car. Probably end up putting another motor in it, knowing my luck. Four million parts and simply can't have one. Right when you think it's all over and done, life comes up and kicks you right in the nuts. Good thing my wife keeps them in her purse. Three-eighty-three... ****. I don't have another 440 here. There was a... But once again, parts have gone missing. If you asked me for something, I'd probably give it to you. If you steal it, you should be beaten with a bat. Let me think, let me think, let me think! Hey, Gregg. One week later... Bet you didn't think you'd see me again so soon. ...Mike bought a new distributor for the Super Bee. - Are the keys in it? - They are. It's going to be incredible. And Gregg is about to surprise his daughter. When Gregg opens the garage, that's going to be quite an emotional moment. He hasn't told her anything about it. - Hey, gorgeous. - How you doing? - Stand right there. - Okay. This one here. A Super Bee! A Super Bee. I'm gonna cry! Is that yours? That's ours. That's our Super Bee. That's a friend of mine, Mike. Holy shit! - Hello. - Hello. - Oh, my God. - Take this puppy for a little burn. Oh, my God. I can't believe you did this. - I got a Super Bee... - I was cried out! I know. I'm shaking. Light it up, Dad. Just a little bit. - Ready? Hang on. - Yeah. I'm holding. Oh! I don't think I've seen that surprised a look in a long time. I honestly thought she was going to have to pick her jaw up off the floor. It was priceless. Priceless. It's going to be an emotional attachment, it's going to be a bond between him and his daughter. I'm glad I was there to witness it. That is so cool. Look at that thing. - That's good, Mark. - Hang on. Weinies, okay. We've got buns. Oh, yeah. We're set, man. Gourmet feast, Ave. - Huh? - A gourmet feast, buddy. Somewhere I got a fire pit. A few days later... - There. - ...Mike and Avery have a plan - to catch a thief. - Look at that. Every time I go down in the field, I notice more parts are gone. Me and Avery are gonna have a campout. We're hoping somebody comes down there tonight and tries to take some shit. I like that Parisienne. Lincoln, you hungry? - We got a weinie for you. - Keep that dog away from our food. - He ate my burrito last time. - I know. He's more interested in gophers. Get off that car! When I think of people going into my yard and stealing my parts, it drives me nuts. Flame on. Things are happening. That's my wienie stick, go find your own. What have we got for a seat? Look at that. - What the **** are you doing? - Nothing. This is cozy. We're approaching nirvana, with hot dogs cooking here. Look at that, isn't that a thing of beauty? I wonder if anybody's gonna come pilfer any of your parts. We're down far enough that we can see somebody come over the hill. The cars in the Field of Dreams, they're what I've accomplished in my life in 40 years. I've saved every one of those cars from being crushed. There's something special about that place and about those cars. It's been a tough couple weeks. We've got to get our shit together. There's no more time for practice. - Mike, I'm getting tired. - Crawl in, I'll watch the fire for a bit. If I take a shit-kicking this year, I'm done. But, I consider myself very lucky to actually get a second chance to follow my dream. Good boy. I don't want to lose this place. Mike, tell me a bedtime story. Once upon a time there was an ugly little troll, and he lived in a wrecking yard, in the back of an old blue-and-white Chevy square body. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
