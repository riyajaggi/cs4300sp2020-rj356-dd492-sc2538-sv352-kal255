 MY HEAD MADE THE CHOICE TO END THINGS WITH MATTY. BUT MY HEART? MY HEART WAS STILL WAITING FOR THE CHANCE THAT MY HEAD MIGHT... [knocking] RECONSIDER.

 >> BECAUSE WE CAN ALL SHARE. >> THIS ISN'T REAL. THIS ISN'T REAL. THIS ISN'T REAL. THIS ISN'T REAL. >> THE AD DOES SEEM FAKE AND CREEPY. "WE CAN ALL SHARE." WHO WANTS THAT? >> WHAT ARE YOU READING? >> THE MISSED CONNECTIONS IN OUR AREA. I'M SEEING IF ANYONE WAS TOO SHY TO ASK ME TO THE FORMAL. BUT THIS SITE IS CLEARLY ONLY FOR PERVS.

BUT HE DOESN'T, AND HE DIDN'T. >> DO YOU THINK DESTINY IS DETERMINED BY CHANCE OR CHOICE? >> CHANCE. 100%. IF DESTINY WAS BY CHOICE, I WOULD HAVE DEVELOPED AN ASS INSTEAD OF A MUSTACHE. >> BUT I WAS THE ONE WHO ENDED THINGS WITH MATTY. MAYBE I MISDIRECTED FATE AND MISSED MY CONNECTION TO BE WITH HIM. >> OKAY, YOU'RE GETTING REALLY DEEP, AND IT'S FAR TOO EARLY FOR ME TO PROCESS ANYTHING MORE THAN YOUR MORNING BREATH. [sniffs] WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS RANK. >> DID I SCREW UP MY DESTINY, OR WAS MY FATE SUPPOSED TO STINK? [keyboard clacking] I"M THINKING I WANT TO WEAR MY HAIR... UP. DOWN.

YOU KNOW, THAT DRESS WAS SPECIALLY MADE FOR NANA WHEN SHE WAS A MODEL. [sighs] I USED TO THINK, IF I COULD LOOK AS GOOD AS HER IN IT THAT SHE WOULD LOVE ME AS MUCH AS SHE LOVED THAT DRESS.

OH, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME TRYING TO FIT MY BIG-ASS PREGNANT BELLY INTO THAT TINY-- >> DO I LOOK STUPID? >> YOU LOOK... PERFECT.

IN THE PAST. >> MING'S GOING WITH VERA. >> SURPRISE. >> HI. CAN WE SIDEBAR? IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL ME, BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE VERA IS OF THE ELLEN VARIETY. >> GOING WITH A GIRL FRIEND WAS THE ONLY WAY MY PARENTS WOULD LET ME GO.
