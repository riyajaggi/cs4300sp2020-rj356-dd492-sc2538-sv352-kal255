 Fleming (2014): Season 1, Episode 2 - Episode #1.2 - full transcript 
 A mischievous Ann invites Fleming to Esmond's birthday party, and although Fleming has brought Muriel as his date, sexual chemistry sizzles between them. Meanwhile, France is looking like it's about to crumble against Nazi forces. Office bound and desperate to be a man of action, Fleming urgently tries to persuade Godfrey to send him to France to oversee the destruction of secret files at one of their bureaus. To his surprise, Godfrey accepts. Fleming sets-off on his mission, but when unexpected obstacles arise, how will he handle the dangerous consequences?

 In my estimation, you're quite easily the worst stock broker in London. - Haven't we met? - We have now. I am not my father or my brother, nor do I have any intention of being. So what exactly are you? The lesser Fleming. Cheer up, Mr Fleming, I'm about to offer you a job. - Second Officer Monday. - What a pleasure. Esmond says you're a bad boy. It's finally starting, Monday. Welcome to bloody Lisbon. Neutral territory and the crossroads of the world.

 Positively crawling with Nazis. Every variety of refugee, traitor, fascist, arms dealer and black marketer you can imagine. I like it already. Best behave here, Fleming. We don't need a diplomatic incident. We're already at war. Not currently with Portugal. She's probably waiting for an exit visa, or she'll be stuck here like the rest of them. Poor devil. I don't suppose the Nazis will help her, even for a high price. But they trade in hope. The agenda for tomorrow is in three separate sections. Am I boring you, Fleming? Another country, another dreary meeting.

 - Is it too late to get out of it? - Yes, it is. All this admin. We could be out there getting our hands dirty. Contingency plans for a Nazi victory in France, hardly routine. If we abandon France, the Germans walk into Paris. Simple as that. The Atlantic would be wide open and their U-boats could threaten British supplies. So what will happen to the French Navy? Well, Darlan is the key to this whole thing. Churchill wants the French ships, but Admiral Darlan won't play the game. If their fleet falls to the Nazis... We lose the war. - Can't Churchill persuade Darlan? - It's tricky. We can't send him to talk to Darlan, and Darlan won't talk to anyone else. Any thoughts, Fleming? Perhaps we should give him the Isle of Wight for the duration. Just turn it into French territory. I wish I found the situation as amusing as you. War isn't a game, you know. Fleming? I think I'm going to call it an evening. Let's sleep on the Darlan business. I'm sure we'll come up with something. - You've hardly touched your drink, sir. - Night-night. - Can you cash a cheque? - Yes, sir. Good. Don't you think we'll be done by Thursday? Well, Philips will have us back by Friday at the very latest. My chips, please. This will never be the same again, really. It's awfully sad. Yes, I know what you mean. Oh, sir, do you know, I think I might have left my lighter. - Right-o. - Well, goodnight then. - Goodnight, sir. Fleming, what on earth do you think you're doing? I'm having a little fun. I'm going to clean the bastards out. Let's raise the stakes, shall we? Bank is now at 100,000 escudos. How much is that in real money? About 1,000. Do you have that? - Of course not. - Sir? 100, 000 escudos. I'm afraid I need to be sure. Thank God for petty cash. - Fleming, you can't. - I just did. Is... Is that good for us, or bad? Did we win? Damn. Oh, Fleming, don't despair. It's only money. It's completely replaceable. Would you excuse me a moment? Danke. - I've changed my mind about this place. - Yes, I have rather too. - Come on, let's go. - I'll just finish my drink. Well, excuse me. - Come on. - Fleming? Are you telling me you knew absolutely nothing about the dead Nazi? Nothing at all. This is war, Fleming. Your place is here with me, not trying to bankrupt the Germans at baccarat, is that clear? We need people who can go in and improvise. Thought it was my imagination that got me this job. Your job is to aid Naval Intelligence, not play games with other people's money. - Your behaviour was reckless. - Thank you. Compliment accepted. If you're going to be insolent, it wouldn't kill you to call me "sir". # Don't let's be beastly to the Germans # For you can't deprive a gangster of his gun # Though they've been a little naughty... # Look, there's the chocolate sailor. Commander Fleming. - Hello. - So pleased you could make it. Lady Ann O'Neill, this is Miss Muriel Wright. Oh, forgive the laughter. I'm so pleased you came. It's... It's just that you look... Ridiculous? I know. I was going to say... Rather wonderful. Miss Wright? - Can I call you Muriel? - Of course. Happy birthday. - Thank you, Fleming. - Congratulations. You should hang on to that girl. She's quite a catch. Everyone knew you'd meet Miss Right eventually and now you have. Miss Rights are two-a-penny. It's Miss Wrong I'm looking for. Mmm. Aren't we all? Now, tell me, who do you know? Well, of course, that's Esmond, the birthday boy. Viscount Rothermere, he owns the Daily Mail . Rothermere, I thought he was your husband. Oh, no. My husband's in the army, overseas on active duty. Please tell me you're not a prude. That would be terribly boring. I suppose the war changes things. I thought life was simple. But it's very complicated. I can see we're going to get along very well indeed. # ...and he brought us all to hell again # But don't let's be beastly to the Hun # - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Hurray! Come on. Thank you very much. You didn't return my calls. Why wouldn't you speak to me? I wasn't sure what to say. I was surprised to get a formal invite. Rather bold inviting me to your lover's birthday party. Esmond likes you. He wanted a party, just a few friends. And we were both anxious to meet Miss Wright. What a lovely little girl. Esmond says I should hang on to her. She's a child. Are you afraid of playing with the grownups? I'm not afraid of anything. Especially not your little games. Thank you. How kind. Thank you. Thank you. And a round of applause for our pianist. And many happy returns to our host. - Excuse me. - It's a tradition. Handsomest man in the room must go round and kiss everyone. - You're it. - This is terribly embarrassing. Very, very unfair. That's rather nice. No, no, no, no. I'm not celebrating my bloody birthday -by kissing a man. -That's Esmond. Ooh, hello. I know who that is. I know who that is. Oh, I like the feel of this. Very good game. What are you doing? I could ask you the same question. Months of silence, ignoring and now this? I have lots of friends, close friends. What makes you think that one little moment of excitement -was the start of anything? - Why did you invite me here? And don't give me that nonsense about Esmond. I saw you at the jazz club with her. Thought it might be fun. Oh. More games? I suppose that's for you to decide. Do you want to play? So good to have you back. To be honest, I wasn't sure I was going to make it. And that's not just bravado. My friends are all dying out there. Bloody massacre. Chased out of France with our tails between our legs. And the war office, they're talking about negotiating surrender. I don't believe it. What would you know about it, sitting behind a desk with your feet up? Sorry, that was uncalled for. Excuse me. - He's upset. It's not his fault. - He is right. I'm stuck here behind a desk while he's leading teams of commandos in the fjords. Your brother has always been an adventurer. It doesn't mean you have to copy him. Succeeds at bloody everything. Even surviving. He's had a ghastly time. I'm getting him transferred. Desk job, military intelligence. Do you expect him to thank you? I lost my husband in the first war, I won't lose my sons, too. Put your napkin straight. I mean, what's the use of a war if I'm stuck behind a bloody desk for the entire thing? There's my brother leading teams of commandos on midnight raids. And what do you do in the war, Daddy? Mmm. I file. I was very good at filing. Are you even listening to me? Who was she? Oh, her? Oh, nobody. A silly little girl with an empty head. - I didn't even like her. - Is that what you think of me? A silly little girl looking for love in a place she knows she can't find it. No, Mu, it's not. What made you like this? Who said anyone did? A girl, I bet. What was her name? Please, I'd like to know. Ian? Monique. French? Swiss. I asked her to marry me. You were in love with her? Bought her home for Christmas one year. It was a disaster. My mother hardly spoke to her. She threatened to disinherit me unless I broke the whole thing off immediately. Well, we couldn't have that now, could we? I've never forgiven her. And I never, ever will. Three, maybe four days the Germans will have taken complete control of France. And Darlan? Holed up in Montbazon, apparently, with his head in the sand. They've sent him numerous envoys, but it's a brick wall. Sly old fox, keeping us all guessing. Leave it to me. Their panzer divisions are 100 miles outside Paris. The first thing they'll do is raid our bureau. We can't risk leaving tactical, secret information to the Nazis. You drew up our protocol. But it's no bloody use if it isn't followed. - I could fly out tonight. - You? I have a list of all our offices, safe houses, dead drops. All I need is a radio operator and a car. No, you know too much. It really wouldn't look good if our information fell into German hands. Or if you fell into German hands. There is no one else. I could be your eyes and ears on the ground, sir. - You're up to something. - No, sir. You just called me "sir" twice. There's only one way I'm going to find out, isn't there? So, you're going away? Not for long. Where? France? Shh. I'm going to go and win the bloody war. Give Hitler a bloody nose. You can come and see Winston, pin a medal on me. I never know which of you I'm gonna get. But I like this one. I want you to come back. - Come back to me, promise. - 'Course I'll come back to you. You're indispensable. Who else would get my cigarettes? Promise? Go on, say it. Say it. Promise. - I promise. - Say it again. The first thing I do will be to see you. I promise. Thank you. Well, what do you think? - I rather like it. - Mmm. Please, take a seat, Mrs Fleming. I'll be with you presently. Look, the wicked witch herself. Don't mention Ian. Why ever not? How lovely to see you. This is Ann, Lady O'Neil. This is Mrs. Evelyn Fleming. I've heard so much about you. - We were just talking about Ian. - Really? - Do you know Ian well? - Lil introduced me. - Now we are firm friends. - Oh. He never mentioned you. How is he? Very well indeed. He has a new girlfriend, perhaps you know her. Yes. You must be very happy for him. Yes, Muriel's a lovely girl. Her father was an MP with Val, my late husband. So I hear. Absolutely charming. Ian says she's a model. Yes. Some rather racy swimsuit pictures in Monte Carlo, but good stock. And you know the best thing? Decent pedigree. - Clean form. - What do you mean? Single. Not a husband, a child, or a lover in sight. Commander Fleming. Don't bother with that rubbish. I hope you don't mind disobeying orders. What's your name? Hepworth, sir. Well, don't salute me and don't call me "sir". Remember that and we'll get on famously. Copy that. - Where to? - Straight to HQ. I'll explain en route. And we're going to need a nicer car. A much nicer car. Hello. - Fancy seeing you here. - Ann. - Are you on a mission? - I come here quite a bit actually. Half the War Office stay here. I am delivering a message. Top secret, you know. We must have a drink. Our men are both away, I'd really like to chat. Yes, that'd be lovely. Burn anything you can't take with you. If it won't burn, bury it. Is this strictly necessary? Do you really think Paris will fall? You have maps of fleet movements in the Atlantic, NID codes, if you don't burn them now, you may as well hand them to the Nazis personally. Godfrey said to give you this. He said to keep it safe, so don't make any stops at casinos on your way back. Sir! - I think I found our vehicle. - What did I say? Don't salute me and don't call me "sir". - Where did you find it? - The showroom on the Boulevard Gouvion. Like you said, they didn't like the idea of a Nazi driving a Rolls. 7.6 litre, 50 horsepower. Nought to 60 in 10.3 seconds. At least we'll be going home in style. Actually, there's one more thing I need to do. - Shall I radio London? - No, forget about that. We have a new mission. Find Admiral Darlan. We need his bloody navy. This is more like it. With all due respect, has this come from the top? Up to a point. Oh, don't look so worried. -Tell them I kidnapped you. Besides, how often do you get to drive a Rolls? I've only just passed my test. Esmond said, "Ian's been at war for years. "Mainly with himself." I thought women were the enemy. - Only his mother. Have you met her? I'd rather take on Hitler. I don't know why I fall for a man like that. Ian's a puzzle. You won't be the first or the last to wonder. I just miss him. He said he'd come and meet me as soon as he got back. He absolutely promised. Men say all sorts of things. It's just the way they are. Sometimes they forget. Sometimes life isn't complicated. Sometimes people mean what they say. Would it matter if I really loved him? The trick is to never let it show. Bonsoir , Commander Fleming, Royal Naval Intelligence. Is that true, sir? Are we really here on Churchill's orders? What do you think? Right, this is it, Hepworth. All or nothing. Salute me, you bloody idiot. Ah! I wondered if the British would have the guts to pay me a visit. What took you so long? It's not too late, Admiral. With your help we can still win this war. My great grandfather died at Trafalgar. Now you come here demanding our French Navy. We are allies now. So let's be honest with each other, shall we? The Nazis are moments away from Paris. Their next stop will be Cherbourg. Maybe it would be to advantage to speak to our German friends. The British government already suspect a French plan to collaborate with the Nazis. Our air force and warships are ready to strike at any moment. The British will destroy the entire French fleet rather than hand it over to the Nazis. You are saying Britain will attack us, their own allies? Do you actually have the authority to negotiate? - Of course. - I don't believe it. You're a boy, playing games he doesn't understand. There's only one possible outcome to this. Don't be a fool. You're playing with fire. Admiral. Commander Fleming. Excuse me a moment. - Sir, he just got into... - Stay there. He's driving away, sir. Make yourself comfortable. - Get on the radio and call London. - Copy that, sir. - We've received a message, sir. - What is it? Fleming's on his way to Bordeaux. He's following Admiral Darlan. I don't know. Maybe we should radio for backup. Darlan is here somewhere. I'm not giving up. Make way, I'm a British Officer. Move aside. I'll deal with this. Find Darlan. Go! I found him, sir. On the docks. We still have time. Well, Darlan's given us his answer. He'll hand his fleet to the Germans. And now we're on our own... England, I mean. With the Nazis only 20 miles away. Here you are, sir, Avery Street. Thank you very much. - Hello? - Mu. - I'm back. I've been so worried. It's a bloody mess. I'll explain when I see you. I'm coming over. Bye. Bye, darling. Your housekeeper let me in. I hope you don't mind. What on earth are you doing? You scared me to death. I was caught in a raid last night. - Was it bad? - There were only two survivors. Just two. Me and the Bishop of Lichfield. Maybe God answered your prayers. It wasn't God who saved us. It was a dining table. -You're hurt. -No, I'm... Just... Just a little shaken. I want to stay with you tonight. - No, I can't. I promised... - Please, please, please. We should go to the shelter. I thought I was going to die last night. It wasn't the dying I was afraid of... It was dying alone. There we sit in our gilded little bird cage, drinking and dancing and laughing. Treating the world as if it's some wonderful game. But it isn't, is it? Not when the bombs start to fall. And all you want is someone to love. Well, you have a husband, and a lover. Don't you love them? What about you? Are you in love? With that blonde girl who brings you cigarettes. She needs love and reassurance like a puppy. - She's not for you. - You don't know me. Or her. Please. It's the all clear. It's over. - There you go, guv. - Thank you. For a sweetheart? Yes. Yes, I suppose they are. Mu? I didn't know where else to go. Esmond will be here soon. I don't want to be on my own. I'm sorry. What do you want from me? What do I want from you? You came to see me. Why? You want me to hold your hand while you cry into your whisky. You want me to tell you that you've lost your true love. You only would've hurt her eventually. You only love her now because she's dead. If she was still alive you would break her little heart, like you do all the rest. That's just you. You'll never change. Perhaps it's better this way. Is that how you want it? Hmm? Is that how you want it? You wouldn't dare. You wouldn't dare! Like that? Hmm? Like that? What's wrong with you, Fleming? Are you trying to get us both sacked? - You told Admiral Darlan a pack of lies. - I didn't lie, I implied. Don't chop logic with me. - You still think it's a game. - War is a game. One we can't afford to lose. If I hadn't helped those refugees, you'd be looking at reports of a bloody massacre. Can't you see that? What am I gonna do with you? I was hoping you'd ask. - Well? - Intelligence Commandos. If the Germans have them, we need them too. We have to beat them at their own game. Go on. Well, their commandos go in and pull out whatever documents are left behind. But they send them in at the frontline. So, what if we went one better? Send our intelligence commandos in ahead, way ahead. These aren't soldiers, these are spies. Thirty men to start, more later if needed. Who's gonna run this unit? I am. Will it keep you out of trouble? Almost certainly not. It's a bloody good idea. Thank you, sir. I thought you might like to know, Churchill's given Darlan an ultimatum, hand over the French fleet or we bomb it at anchor. You have good instincts, use them. A little less shouting than I would've thought. I think the old man's gone soft. Nice bracelet. Another trophy, I presume. Hmm. I'm out of cigarettes. I use to have someone who would fetch me... Would you mind? On your lunch break. Yes, yes. Of course. Thank you. Ian. Well, Peter. Good to see you back. I hear it was touch and go out there. Oh, not really. You're the hero of the family. Well, not now. Desk job. Congratulations. Now you chaps are exactly where we were three years ago. A complete bloody shambles. - This is unbelievable. - Keep your boy on a leash, Godfrey. I don't your mothers will miss you. She'll break you. You should join the winning team. You see, I'm not designed for marriage. You feel blood pumping, you'll feel faint, but every moment is crisp and clear. Most of us won't come back alive. I can hear our man's voice. We need to feel how he loves, too. You really do have rather a flair for this. At least we agree on something. Sync by Sergie Mercury.
