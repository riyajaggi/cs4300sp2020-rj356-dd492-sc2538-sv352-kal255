 A gourmet fantasy. I'm going to yoga class. I'll be back in the evening. Please eat something for lunch. Please water the flowers. Shizuko. WARRING STATES PERIOD SAMURAI LEGEND MID-DAY BEER AT A RESTAURANT Maybe I should go out. Hm? Go out... but where? It's been 15 years since I moved to this area. I walked to the train station through this park... every day. But... this is the first time I've walked this slowly. I ended up at the train station by habit. I don't need to go to the office anymore. Hm? I never noticed this place while I was on my commute. RESTAURANT AOKI A Japanese set-meal restaurant. That reminds me... I always had Set A at the office cafeteria for lunch. I can't eat there anymore. Okay. I've decided where to go. I'm going in. Welcome. It's like a Showa-era Japanese restaurant. It feels so nostalgic. Sit wherever you'd like. FRIED SQUID SET FRIED MACKEREL SET BEEF CROQUETTE SET Here's some water. Everyone here is working. -Done. -Okay. Here you are. The hamburger steak is coming. I'm gonna eat. Thanks for the meal. -Hamburger steak, order up! -Yes. -Here you go. -Thanks. SHUMAI EGG SAUSAGE FRIED CHICKEN CHILI SAUCE KARAAGE EGGPLANT BELL PEPPER PORK SPICY MISO SET Okay. -Thanks for the meal. -Thank you. Thanks. Excuse me. -Can I order? -Yes. What would you like? The eggplant, bell pepper, and pork with spicy miso. Yes. And easy on the rice. Yes. And pickled cucumbers. -Yes. -Thank you. Thank you. -Fried mackerel. -That will be seven dollars. -Thank you. -Mapo eggplant. Yes. Thank you for the exact change. - Karaage . -Thank you. Beer... I want a drink. I want a drink. Cold beer... No. But... Thank you very much. Drinking beer during the day on a weekday isn't really... Wait. It doesn't matter if it's a weekday or the weekend. I'm not a corporate man anymore. WE HAVE COLD BEER I can drink whenever I want. There is nothing to worry about. Um... Excuse me. I can't help feeling guilty. I guess I'll just have water. After 38 years, it's not so easy... to escape from... the working-man spirit. If I were a samurai, I would drink in the middle of the day without any guilt. That's definitely a real samurai. What's going on? Miss. Sake! Coming! Here. Thanks. Drinking in the middle of the day? He's really kicking back. -Don't end up a failure like him. -Right. What's so funny? Sake is best in the afternoon. Not being able to do that... Being an employed samurai must be tough. You insolent bastard! How dare you mock us? Unacceptable! Sorry. Hey! Go! We're going home! Miss! Good pickles. Yes. Delicious! So delicious! Okay, pork fillet katsu! -Yeah. -Here you go. Thanks. Did I just see an illusion? No. What I just saw was... how I really should be. Miss. Beer. Yes! I don't need to worry about what anyone thinks or follow anyone. I'm going to live how I want. My goal from now on... is to become like a masterless samurai. Enjoy your drink. Drinking beer alone... on a weekday afternoon... This is exactly what I wanted to do. For the first time after retiring, I feel like I've got a new perspective on life! I could get used to this. -It's done. -Okay. Thank you for waiting. Eggplant, bell pepper, and pork with spicy miso, easy on the rice, and pickled cucumbers. Okay. Thank you for the meal. Delicious. This is just right. Strong flavors... go well with beer. Beer goes down easy during the day. Maybe because I'm not tired yet. The pickles are perfect. I should explore more. This is what freedom means. Excuse me. -One more, please. -Yes! I did it! I did it! My first beer in the middle of the day! You scared me. Where did you go? Just around here for a bit. Do you... think the face is red? I think it's red. Really? Well... Actually, I... -I just had-- -Do I... look red? I drank too much wine at lunch. She beat me! What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. Takeshi Kasumi. Sixty years old. I lost my title, but my life... has just begun. Subtitle translation by Hoday Stearns
