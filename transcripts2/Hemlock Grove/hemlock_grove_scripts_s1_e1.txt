 Oh, you're so weird, Roman. - But I like it. - Shh! You don't know my name. Oh! Sorry. You didn't like that? Oh, no, baby. It's tr?s kinky. This is too much. You know my name? You're the kid in the candy store. This is the part where you leave. OK, girls! Are we ready?

 Yeah! And go! One, two, three, four, five, six, jump, seven, eight! Go one, two... strong arms!... three, four, five, six, jump, seven, eight! Go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, jump! Go one, two, three, four, five, six... last jump... seven, eight! Woo! So, particle physics. What does that mean? In essence, we are starting with Einstein's theory of relativity, we're moving on to the Big Bang theory, and then it goes right back to what I said before... particles. So, it means the particles of the largest structure are equal to the particles of the smallest structure. Any questions? - Ms. Bluebell. - This was

 not as "accessible" to lay readers as you said. I believe what I said was MORE accessible to lay readers. And if you think that's not true, I'd be happy to lend you my master's thesis. You didn't like it. I loved it. There's just... so much more happening than what you think you see. Well, why don't you keep it? Really? I insist. Here. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Is there a house? I think it's half a house. Uhhuh. It's home sweet home! Ah, let's get, uh, cozy. OK. Hello, neighbor. Oh, man. Vince. He was sad when he was sober. Vince was sober? Yeah, when it counted. Ah, we're in business. Oh. - I'm gonna go for a walk. - OK. - Go to town. - Yeah. Hang those herbs up, though, before you go. Oh, man. Oh, this is just... Oh, baby. Bye, Mom! Perfect timing. - You're mommy's little thief. - Huh? Where's the, uh... - Oh, yeah. - ...the thing? - I put all of our tools in here, OK? You didn't need my help at all to clean up this place. Oh, I cleaned! Looks pretty nice. You know what they say about pearls before swine? Uh... no. Ah, well, I'll tell ya later. I cooked pork chops but... it's OK. OK. To our new home. Ah!Mil truj! You're a gypsy. - And you're a stalker. - I've seen you swimming in my grandparents' pond. - So you've seen me naked. - I don't care. It's just that I'm a novelist, so it's important to me to understand people's motivations. You're a novelist, huh? - Impressive. - Why swim in their pond when the river's right there? 'Cause the river's polluted as balls. And to get your facts straight, I'm only a half-breed... technically. My grandfather, Nicolai, he was full Kalderash Roma from the Carpathians, but... he came to the States and he married gadje woman. What does any of that mean? It means us Rumanceks will forever ride the earth on two horses with only one ass. You want a beer? Beer kills brain cells. Ah. Some of us have extra, then. Well, then the guy who used to live here must have been... a rocket scientist. What happened to him? Vince, my uncle, died of alcohol poisoning. Do you worship the devil? Do we worship the devil, she says. Each point represents an element, the topmost being the soul. Plus, it looks fuckin' metal. What? Are you a werewolf? Now we know who your literary influences are. You gonna find me a vampire to have a sexless - three-way with? - Gross. But your index and middle fingers are the same length. And they say that makes you a werewolf. Jesus. Where did you get something like that? I don't know. TV or whatever. So, are you a werewolf, or what? Sure. Are you a retard? No. My heightened werewolf senses indicate otherwise. I don't think you're supposed to use that word. Yeah. "Werewolf" is pretty racist. I prefer "sexy man-beast". Again, gross. I mean "retard". I know what you meant. - That's Tom. - Tom? He's my friend's dad. He's cool. - I go to school with his kids... - No. Ha. Know when to say when. You're weird. There's the door. And kind of mean. But good material. I'm a patron of the arts. Welcome to the neighborhood. Jesus! Do the fields need tilling? Much as it pains me to deprive monsieur of his customary 14 hours, he has an appointment. Oh, shit. I completely spaced. I told Letha I'd squire her to the amusement park later. Take her tomorrow. School starts tomorrow. Precisely why you need new clothes. I don't need new clothes. It's taken me 17 years to perfect my look, all right? Apparently not enough time to learn the distinction between vintage and old. These rags are retired. You're going shopping. Isn't Norman saying that in this economy we need to be backing off on the conspicuous consumption front? - It makes us unsympathetic. - And I suppose if your Uncle Norman lent you The Communist Manifesto, I'd have to find recipes for borscht. May I, darling? Roman, you're an adult... more or less. If you'd rather spend the day with your cousin than your mother, just say so. I'd rather hang out with Letha. Of course, darling. Now, I'm not sure Norman would approve, but... I've arranged a small surprise for indulging your poor old mother on the last day of your summer vacation. You rented out Pennsylmania? - I did. All right. Hey, girls. - Hello. - Hey, Dad! Oh, thank God. I could eat a phonebook. - They don't make those anymore. - Well, you can have her's too, because evidently your daughter is off sushi now. - Since when? - I'm not off sushi; I'm off mercury. Hey, what are you reading? Hey, Rome. She what? - Angels? - Pennsylmania? OK! See you then. OK, wait, let me try. Ah... ah! Bellissima! - All right, all right. - Wait. OK. Last man... last man standing! - Feel the Zen. - Wait, one, two, three! Ooh. Wow. What do you want to name it? Huh. Do you know that Pennsylvania has more hate groups per capita out of any state in the country? It's about time we won something. We also lead the nation in Hoho consumption. I wonder if there's a correlation. The moral superiority of being skinny? Hmm. Come on. Mm, not tonight. Seriously? Mm, I'm not in the mood. Come on! When else are you gonna get on this without a line? When have you ever stood in line? - What do you think they think of us? - Who? Exactly. So... what am I thinking? Mmm... that you wish the summer would never end. I'm thinking that it's time to go home. Really? - Mm-hmm. - Come on, no. - Mm-hmm! - Do you want Bob? Yeah! Come on, cuz, let's get out of here. Hey, Hemingway. Don't call me that. OK. I guess summer's over. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Hey, sis. There's this kid at my school. He's an upir. An upir? Yeah, but I don't think he knows it himself. He has a sister... she isn't upir. I don't know what she is. She is so big, she fills up a doorway. They're the Godfreys. That family seems fucked up. The Godfreys are my business. Stay away from them. - I am. - OK. And? Have we got anything more enlightening to report from our first day at school? There's this new kid. He's a gypsy. This girl's been spreading all these crazy rumors about him. I think he's related to that guy in the trailer by the river. Filth. Pryce told me you were here! Pryce called you? That's funny. What is it? What is it? What is it? My legacy! My legacy. It's not even two years old! It's already 40 pounds! It knows what you're feeling from across the room! You know how it knows that? You know it knows because of the light! The fucking light! Have you considered putting Shelley in a special care... Do not call her that! Do not call that abortion by my daughter's name! I know it's my fault! I know! I brought evil into our house! - Oh, come on, J.R. Come on! - And she may look like a woman, and she may fuck like a woman, but I will not be deceived! I hired a private investigator to find her people. Guess what, Norman? She doesn't have any. There are no people! Will you help me? I'll help you find the right kind, yes. No. Help me destroy her. Before she destroys our family. You're my goddamn brother! No one's going to destroy anyone, J.R. No one. Now, maybe it's best you come and stay with me and Marie for a little while, huh? Yeah. I know you're fucking her.

He was born with the caul. He will always be mine. Oh, angel. Come here. It's all right, Roman. You'll be so much stronger than he was. Norman. What a wonderful surprise. Is this a serious proposal? Perhaps I spoke too soon. A 60% proposed increase for research and development funding alone, following a 30% increase from last quarter. Would you like to come inside? I can offer you, um, a coffee... or a Valium. With no accompanying report of anything approaching transparency of what exactly we're setting out to produce. Money. We produce money. Your brother taught me that. I can't imagine why it gives you - so much difficulty. - Neither could my brother. You know, darling, if it's transparency you're after, you could just simply ask Dr. Pryce what he wants the money for. Well, he's the only person I know who's a better liar than you are. He most certainly is not! Oh, don't be cute, Olivia. You're bad at it. Come inside. I can at least deduce what really brought you to my bloody doorstep in comfort. Pennsylmania, Olivia? I mean, really? Oh, come on, Dr. Killjoy. They won't be children much longer. It's an insult to the town. Well aware of your love affair with appearances. And no favor to the kids either. You know, you can spoil Roman all you want, but leave my daughter out of it. I, um... can't control... who Roman decides to spend his time with. Well, no one was accusing you of having any control over him. Oh, man, that's bad. That's really bad. I know her family. I went to school with her dad. That's pretty tough. First day at school. Some first day. - Anything in the perimeter? - No sign of a weapon, Sheriff. - Tracks? - No. Nothing. It's all hard-packed sand. - The car was all busted up on the road. Window broken in. Jesus Christ. Who could've done that? Who's that kid? Bring him to me. - Boy. Come here, please. - Me, sir? - You're the only boy I see. - I was just walking through. - Just come here, please, OK? - OK. The sheriff would like to have a word with you. You live around here, son? Yeah. Home's that way, and school's that way, so I was... I was just walking through. Did you happen to hear anything last night? No, sir. It was a quiet night. What's your name? It's Peter, sir, uh, Rumancek. - What... what's going on here? - Get his statement, get his ID, - make sure he gets to school. - OK. Come on. Come on. Rumancek. - Vince Rumancek? - Gypsy trash. I'll take you in my cruiser. Come on. You can sit in the front, but don't touch anything. ...police are describing is as one of the most grizzly... Hey. Hey, Shelley. ...In local memory. A young student was found killed... What is it? And partially disemboweled earlier this morning in Kilberry Park of south Hemlock Grove. Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's OK. It's OK. I'm here. I'm here. It's OK. The coroner has tentatively identified the victim as Brooke Bluebell, 17, a student attending. Penrose High School. Bluebell was last seen leaving school yesterday afternoon, and her car was reportedly discovered near the crime scene. Officials are refusing to speculate on the cause of death, but eyewitnesses suggest the ferocity of the attack suggests an animal may have been responsible. Officials are asking for anyone who may have seen any suspicious behavior in the park area - to contact the sheriff's office. - Bet he knows something about it. Gypsy creep. - Come on. - That's the guy you think is a werewolf? Hey, Letha. - Oh, my god, Dad. - Can this be real? I just really needed to hear your voice, OK? Yeah. It's good to hear your voice too. I love you, OK, Letha? I... Yeah, I know. I love you too. You really hate coming here, don't you, Norman? Me too! Just when I was getting used to the sound of crickets. It's a fucking nightmare. It is that. I see that girl and I can't help but think it could've been one of mine. Well, it could've been any of ours. I'll put you two together. That's all. Look, I don't know what it is with you and Dr. Pryce, but he is the closest available scientific authority. You really gonna make me ask Olivia... - You know what he did. - No, I don't. None of us do. Sheriff! Norman. Uh... Doctor, sorry to bother you. - We know you're busy. - No apology necessary. A tragedy like this relieves one of adhering to the standard social conventions. It shouldn't even require the summons of a majority shareholder. Norman, how's your family? Let's assume if normally I don't want you asking about my family, today doesn't change a goddamn thing. Certainly. You were going to ask me about an animal attack. Well, uh, we don't know what it is. Oh, the autumn is unkind, little flower. Mm-hmm. - Huh. - We're wasting our time. Mmhmm. Based on subcutaneous bite patterns, I believe you can with certainty exclude from your list a suspect on two legs. We didn't find any animal tracks at the scene. Which is peculiar, but I can only tell you what I see. Her... phone was on when it happened. I got the impression that whatever it was that was attacking her wanted her to watch. Fear is an intoxicant to apex predators. It is not unusual for them to disembowel prey animals and consume the fat between the essential organs to keep them alive as long as possible - during the process. - You do realize a girl is dead. And in the interest of saving precious time, I will mourn her passing subsequent our conversation. Was there anything else? He's all yours. No. Thank you, Doctor. I need... Do you trust his analysis or not? I don't trust if you drew your gun and shot him blood would leave his veins. In the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains of waters: And God... All right, man. Tonight's vigil for Brooke Bluebell will be held at Penrose High Stadium. Hemlock High students are encouraged to attend. It'll be at 7 o'clock tonight. Thank you. Could an upir have done it? It's not their style... usually. The vigil being held later tonight... your sister would like to attend. Pass. I've spent all day around fucking crying girls. Did you know her? Didn't think there was a pair of pom-poms in a 50-mile radius that wasn't within your purview. I didn't know her. Different crowd, I guess. How are you, darling? I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be fine? Do you see me as someone you can trust? Yeah. Peter! Peter, dinner! Peter! PETER! What did it feel like? What did what feel like? Killing that girl.
