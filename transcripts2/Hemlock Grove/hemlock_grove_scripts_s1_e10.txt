 Fuck!
 What time is it?
 It's two weeks
since you passed out.
 What?
 Oh, fuck me.
 - The full moon.
- It's tonight.
 That's why I had
to come back now.
 - That's why I had to come back.
- Whoa, wait, wait.
 - Easy, easy. We should get you
a doctor. All right? - Why?
 Complications?
 What kind?
 How the fuck should I know?
I-I was told
 that comas cause
blank spots or memory shit.
 What? So I check out for two weeks
and suddenly I'm a fucking retard?
 Did my mom tell you
what happened?
 Yeah.
She said you OD'd.
 Yeah.
 Pretty stupid, huh?
 The thing is I...
 I made some mistakes, OK?
 But we really need to do this.
 Do what?
 Kill the vargulf. Make,
make, make things right.
 As much as I fucking hate to say it,
the ball's in my court now, OK?
 No.
 What do you mean, no?
What are you doing? Come on.
 I'm getting the fuck up!
I'm getting the fuck up!
 OK. All right. OK.
 OK.
 We both made some.
 What?
 Mistakes.
 We need to go.
 We're running out of time.
 Thank God.
 So you're just gonna walk away?
 - What, you want to leave a note?
- It's not my call.
 This thing we have to do,
 my mom's not part of it.
 She gets pissed, I'll
blame it on a blank spot.
 Oh, you're not driving.
 You know how to drive stick?
 Just give me the fucking keys.
 All right.

 Hey, sis.
 Hi, Michael.
 [Are the leaves pretty there?]
 - Very.
- [What's on your mind?]
 I'm done.
 After I do what I came here
to do, I'm leaving the Order.
 [It's not supposed
to feel this way.]
 What way?
 [Like doing the right thing
is this fucked up.]
 One second.
 You're working.
 I'm on a beach in Hawaii.
 - Will they let you?
- [What?]
 Will they let you leave?
 No.
 [Will you help me?]
 Michael?
 Yes, anything you need.
 Tomorrow at dawn
 by the water.
 - [You know the place.]
- OK.
 OK.
 Why are we stopping?
 Because someone
needs to say it.
 The vargulf is my problem.
 I'm the one on the hook.
 And?
 Why are you here?
 You know.
 Yeah, I thought I did--
for a while.
 Then it all went to shit.
 Tell me why you want
to come with me tonight.
 It's not about being a hero.
 Are you sure about that?
 I'm sorry for being a pain
in your balls, OK?
 I got confused.
 Things are clearer now.
 At what point does trusting you
 make me a fucking idiot?
 I wish no one else
had to get hurt.
 Someone is--tonight.
 I know.
 Look, I just wanna be
your friend.
 You shouldn't be
out there alone.
 Simple as that.
 You're a loose cannon, Godfrey.
 I'm gonna have your goddamn
stripes for this.
 It's almost like a dream.
 We're all just passing through
the motions of our days
 like shadow puppets
or ghosts of who we were.
 I miss
him too.
 Think anything
can ever be the same?
 See you later.
 Lest you not forsake us,
Lord, and sustain us.
 Bless and protect your flock,
 those who follow
and those who stray.
 And if it be Thy will,
 the recovery of fellow student
Roman Godfrey,
 who remains in a coma.
 Good work.
 A little shading there...
 Darker down there.
 That's really good.
 Ladies room. Emergency.
 OK, Shelley.
 OK, Shelley. Shelley.
 Shh.
 It's OK, I'm fine.
 - I'm glad you're back. - I know.
 I didn't want you to worry,
but I'm really OK.
 Does mother know?
 I have something
I need to do first.
 Don't go.
 I'm not going anywhere,
 but I started something
I can't walk away from,
 and it's really important
you still believe in me.
 OK? Nothing is more
important right now.
 I'll be home soon.
 I'll come back to you.
 Be good.
 Yeah, that's the idea.
 Sheriff Sworn, could you address
some of the wild rumors going around
 about the nature
of these attacks?
 Is this in fact a wild animal, or,
as the fringe have suggested,
 is it some maniac
mimicking a werewolf?
 Forensics tells us the attacks
are animal in nature,
 but the pattern of the last
two months can't be denied.
 Meaning what exactly?
 Meaning a curfew will be
in effect for all minors
 as of sundown. Non-minors
on the street after sundown
 will be expected to have
a damn good reason to be.
 Thank you, Sheriff Sworn.
You heard it. Stay inside
 and lock your doors.
 Let's go.
 Roman?
 Roman!
 That little shit.
 - Protocol.
- [Cipher.]
 Little mouse.
 So, we've made progress
with the target
 and now we're ready
for containment?
 - Yes.
- [Excellent.]
 [Because we've received a rather disconcerting
call from your brother, Michael.]
 - Michael called you?
- He's worried about you.
 It seems rather a team sport
 for those who are fond of you.
 - There's nothing to worry about.
- [Horseshit.]
 Are you all right, little mouse?
 [I can't say this
has been an easy one, ]
 but in the words of the immortal
Hank Williams, I've seen the light.
 I worry that, of my assets,
 my own objectivity
is most clouded
 where you are concerned.
 Are you expecting an apology
 for my winning personality?
 - Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
- [I know, ]
 - and thank you, sir.
- [Good.]
 Good.
 Bonne chance.
 And all that.
 State troopers are covering all the
park entrances and trailheads.
 We've got a circuit of volunteer
firemen, mostly hunters.
 They're covering the, uh, utility
easement perches throughout town.
 - Firemen? - Yeah, we're working
with what we've got, Doctor.
 Of course. I understand you're setting
up a network of feeder lights.
 Through the wooded areas. Look,
we're all hands on deck here,
 so if you don't mind?
 Tell Smokey the Bear
we said hello.
 That's the forest service.
We're Puddles the Blue Goose.
 - Well, pardonnez-moi. - Sheriff.
 I've tried to be
patient with you,
 but I am at the end of my rope.
 Don't let the comfort
of numbers confuse you.
 - Excuse me?
- You know where you're needed.
 Oh, really? And where is that?
 My line of work,
we use the term umwelt.
 It's a model of the world
 based on a specific creature's
experiences, their perceptions--
 how and what it sees.
 Trust that feeling in your gut.
 This thing we're after,
 it's not anything close to done.
 I'm gonna do my part. Just
making sure you'll do yours.
 OK, besides the obvious,
 I have no idea what the hell
any of that means.
 Just that you have
a lot to protect.
 What is it you're not
telling me?
 Not a thing.
 Just making sure
we're on the same page.
 Jesus Christ.
 Thank you for your hospitality,
Sheriff.
 You're leaving?
 We all gotta go sometime.
 Sorry.
 Good luck tonight.
 - Hey, Christina.
- Hey.
 How was your day?
 Well, I'd love
to say tremendous,
 but that would just be
a fabrication of the truth,
 a distortion. It was OK.
 Ooh, you've been
writing. May I?
 Oh, I, um, I received
your request to lower your meds.
 Yeah. I just,
 I just feel like...
 they're, like,
 blocking something.
 Like... I can't
find my way back.
 Well, I think
we can start to do that.
 Soon.
 You know,
 it used to be that my favorite
thing in the whole world
 was to swim
at night on the lake
 by the light of the full moon.
 There was nothing
like it in the world.
 Do you believe in magic?
 Magic?
 Sometimes.
 Would you rather be at home
tonight with your parents?
 I'm on my way home myself.
 I mean, I can take you
if you like,
 - if it'll make you feel better.
- Thanks, but...
 it'll get me if it wants me.
 Christina,
 you'll be safe here.
 OK.
 Good night, sweetheart.
 Hey, Tom.
 I believe I've accepted
 I've fallen victim
to collective hysteria.
 Well,
 there is the irrational and then
there's the baseless, Norman.
 There's nothing baseless here.
 I posted the extra men
that you asked for at the gate.
 I know you're overextended,
 but consider the expense
out of my own pocket.
 No, no. I appreciate it,
but not necessary, not tonight.
 Is this gonna happen
every goddamn full moon?
 Yes. No.
 I came to see about Chrissy.
 I'm afraid there hasn't been
much of an improvement,
 which is common
with her condition.
 - You need time to reintegrate.
- Are you gonna give me
 this one step forward crap?
 They're tougher than we are.
We forget that.
 Fair enough.
 And the home front?
 It was a struggle,
but the girls are on lockdown.
 I had it my way, I'd lock them down every night.
I might sleep a little better.
 I'm heading home now.
 You know, come tomorrow,
 somebody better buy me
a fucking beer.
 You got it.
 I don't suppose you know
anything about this?
 Where Roman's gone?
 The beauty of your inability to
speak is the inability to lie.
 It's rather refreshing
of my children.
 Don't worry.
I'm not cross.
 With you, at any rate.
 You're worried?
 Of course I am,
 but there's no
pleasanter feeling
 than of necessity.
Unfortunately,
 if you've done
your job adequately,
 in spite of yourself,
 you find you're not
needed at all.
 You think I haven't
known what he was up to
 this entire bloody while?
 These roles were assigned
before recorded time.
 These same boards trod
a thousand generations.
 And somehow the climax
is as unforeseeable
 and astonishing
every goddamn time.
 Will he be all right?
 It's a pity you don't drink.
 You're sure about this?
 Are you?
 I'll be able to pick up its scent
from where it left the girl.
 Will I be able to keep up?
 No.
 You should watch your back.
 Do you love her?
 Yeah.
 - Shee-it.
- Shee-it.
 Do you remember anything?
From when you were out?
 A little. Still
mostly a feeling,
 like I have something
unfinished,
 - something I need to do.
- Like what?
 Guess I'll know when I see it.
 Hmm.
 Come back, Tilson.
 [Tilson, Reed and Fountain,
position clear.]
 [All right, continue
to respond, guys.]
 Copy.
 Copy. Brady position, come back.
 [Brady, Main and Skyline, ]
 [position clear.]
 "Went to bed hungry.
Woke up with a boner."
 Ew, that's so gross. I don't
even get it. Who said that?
 - Steve Berna.
- Oh, he's hot, but so dumb.
 Oh, my god. Leigh Anne Morris
changed her profile picture
 to that. She looks like
a walrus with a UTI.
 And what does a walrus
look like when it has a UTI?
 When you know that walrus
has been dating Luke Vezetti
 and he hasn't washed his hands
since third grade.
 - Oh, sick!
- Gun to your head:
 Steve Berna or Luke Vezetti?
 - Um, the bullet?
- Gun to Christina's head.
 - Luke Vezetti.
- Ew, what?
 OK, you know what?
 Steve always has a yellow stain
around his armpit
 and then I'd have to listen
to him rank Nickelback albums.
 At least Luke doesn't talk much.
 OK, I'm gonna write
on Leigh Anne's wall.
 "Alyssa loves Luke."
 Smiley face tongue out.
 You bitch.
Whatever, I don't care.
 I'm so bored!
 - And kind of horny.
- Hey, Daddy.
 - Hey, girls. Just seeing how you're doing.
- We're fine.
 She sees.
 Mom? She sees
what you do for us.
 Oh, Daddy!
 I love you both so much.
 I won't be far.
 Can we have a gun?
 No, we can't have a gun.
 OK.
 OK.
 OK.
 If anything happens tonight,
 this is on you.
I have to do this alone.
 I know.
 God help us.
 - Don't go following me.
- Yeah, yeah, I won't.
 Hey.
 Everything all right?
 I'm in for the night
with Wharton
 - and the pricey stuff.
- Well, it is an occasion.
 - Letha?
- Morose,
 like a spongy cantaloupe. Won't
speak. That boy, I imagine.
 And who knows what his
full moon plans are.
 Attempt at humor.
 Desire to fight is zero percent.
 Apparently he was
attacked yesterday.
 Some boys beat him up after
school. She saw the whole thing.
 Jesus.
 At a time like this,
the only thing there is
 is to stay together.
 You're home. She's safe.
 We have so much
to be thankful for.
 Oh, yeah, yeah.
 I know.
 She's lucky to have you
as a father.
 Where is she?
 She's in the kitchen.
 - Hey.
- Hey.
 I'm gonna make some pasta.
 - Boscaiola.
- I'll go upstairs.
 No, stay. Me and your mom
could use the company.
 You mean a buffer?
 I'm sorry.
I'm not me right now.
 Is there anything
you want to talk about?
 I used to think there wasn't a problem
in the world you couldn't solve.
 You know,
 I wish it wasn't part
of the mythic cycle
 that I inevitably
disappoint you.
 You don't.
 And you couldn't.
 You know, maybe you want to
watch a bad movie with me later.
 Yeah. Maybe I will.
 Fuck this.
 Peter?
 Peter?
 I'll just be here.
 Is there a scent?
 Peter!
 Stay back!
 - What is that?
- Ketamine dart.
 OK, you don't understand.
You need to listen--
 - There's plenty more of it
if you take another step.
 - Listen to me...
- Do not attempt eye contact.
 Keep your hands
where I can see them.
 Do not attempt eye contact.
I will shoot you.
 It's not him.
 I said it's not him!
 - How do you know that?
- Because...
 I was with him the last time,
the whole night.
 You're lying.
 You have a tell,
 a wavering tremolo,
if you will,
 - in your voice.
- If you hurt him,
 - you're dead, you hear me? You're dead.
- He's fine.
 If you threaten me again I'll come
over there and break your teeth in.
 OK, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
but I'm telling you,
 you don't know what you're doing
right now. It's not Peter.
 We were tracking the vargulf.
That's why we came out here,
 to get the scent.
 Just how much of what you think
you know is what he told you?
 If there's another one tonight,
it's gonna be your fault.
 - It'll be your fault.
- Roman,
 what can be done
with few assumptions
 is done in vain with more.
 This is not your friend.
This is not a person.
 I know that's hard
for you to accept.
 I believe it is for him too.
 I believe that you came here
to find the monster.
 So did he.
 Because he can't know
that about himself.
 You can't know that about yourself
and continue being a person.
 That's bullshit.
 That's just bullshit.
 This is an animal.
That is what this is.
 Again, do not attempt
eye contact.
 Can't you see
I'm trying to help?
 - Why won't you let me help?
- Because you don't believe in God.
 Please go to your car
 and leave of your own volition.
 I'm gonna be really pissed off
if you make me shoot you.
 I'm not afraid of you.
 You hurt him and I'll kill you!
I swear to God.
 OK, just don't hurt him.
Just don't hurt him.
 Get the hell out of here.
 Get the hell out of here!
 I'll fucking find you!
 God doesn't want you
to be happy, Roman.
 He wants you to be strong.
 I am flooded with feelings
that I can't share, so I write.
 Not to Uncle Norman,
not this time,
 because he would not understand.
 I write because I'm terrified.
 I almost lost Roman once, and
now he's risking himself again.
 I want to reach inside him and tear this
miserable obsession from his heart.
 But there's nothing I can do any more
than I can stop the night from falling.
 And worse, as much as I fear
for my brother's safety,
 even more I dread
my mother's response.
 Talk to me, little mouse.
 Rumancek has been contained.
 [Outstanding.]
 Shall we expect
to see you shortly?
 Yes.
 Clementine, bring
the animal to us.
 Do not purge the beast.
 [Do you understand?]
 - Of course, sir.
- [I trust you,]
 - little mouse.
- [He's in sleepy town.]
 Make a bed.
 Don't worry, baby,
 I can save one of us.
 Come to my assistance
in this great need,
 that I may receive
the consolation
 and succor of heaven
 in all my tribulations,
 necessities
 - and sufferings.
- I wouldn't do that.
 I see you don't like
your privacy invaded either.
 Ironic,
 though, in fairness,
you are trespassing,
 and in the process of doing so,
 dared to threaten
the life of my son.
 Where I come from,
 it's rather frowned upon
to hunt on the grounds
 - of one's betters.
- Mrs. Godfrey,
 I'm giving you one opportunity
to turn around.
 If you take a step towards me,
I will kill you.
 The cross you wear...
 It's not of your order.
 St. Jude.
 St. Jude.
 Little mouse.
 Aw, little mouse.
 It makes you feel so lost.
 Christina,
 why aren't you answering?
 Seriously, sweetie.
Message, like, a hundred.
 - We just wanted to make sure you were OK.
- We love you!
 Call us back when you can, which you obviously
can because you're stuck by yourself
 in a mental hospital.
Call us, bitch.
 - Kisses.
- OK, Luke Vezetti or Tyler Lane?
 That scar did make
Tyler a lot hotter.
 Trollop! But not wrong.
 I have an idea.
 [O'Herlihey...]
 Waterfront's clear.
 [Tilson, just south
of Kilderry...]
 No sightings.

 Sheriff, we, uh...

 Honey... honey...
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy.
 It's OK.
 I prayed.
 I prayed that
if it had to happen,
 it happened to someone else.
 Not her.
 As long as it wasn't her.
 It's OK.
 Tomorrow at dawn,
 by the water.
 You know the place.
 I washed the blood
off, Michael.
 Is that right?
 Think I'm standing here
waiting for your opinion?
 Hell if I know what you do.
 That's a disappointment.
 I'm dry,
 almost a year.
 They did do that for me.
 Daddy's dead.
 They asked me to wait to tell you.
Didn't want you getting distracted.
 Good.
 - You kill him?
- No.
 - Don't you ever fucking lie to me, Michael.
- A man who lived like that,
 more satisfying to watch him
do it to himself.
 Amen to that.
 You really think God wants us to forgive
each and every one of his creations?
 I ain't about to start
answering that.
 - What are you doing?
- It's a microscope.
 We're gonna be late
for school.
 Shit.
 Come on.
 Look, there's more.
 There's one right there.
 - Wait. Maybe we shouldn't be here.
- Shut up.
 Ah!
