 Animals.
 Sheriff Sworn.
Olivia Godfrey here.
 Mm? Yes, yes, quite. And yours?
 Well, I hate to be a bother,
but I've recently heard reports
 of trespassers
around the mill building--
 reports just confirmed.
 Urban explorers
or some such nonsense.
 What I'm asking for, Sheriff,
are some extra patrols.
 Someone may get hurt.
 Yes, that would be fine.
 What if Destiny was wrong?
 What if the invitation was in
Willoughby's car? Or her purse?
 - What if the moon hits your eye?
- What if it was an e-vite?
 Then the Order of the Dragon
will have to find
 - a new adventure.
- Suck a bag of dicks!
 I never called us
the Order of the Dragon.
 Yup.
 What's with this guy?
 I don't know.
He's just old.
 Gross.
 How old's your mom, anyway?
 Why don't you ask her that?
 What if they don't leave?
 What if we stop beginning
sentences with those two words?
 Hm?
 Fuck Penrose.
 Hey! We were gonna wait
till they left.
 Roman!
 Asshole. What the fuck?
 Can I help you?
 Mr. Willoughby.
We're here about Lisa.
 This isn't a good time.
 Mr. Willoughby.
 You're exhausted.
 You should really take a nap.
 In case you were wondering,
 cops call this shit
breaking and entering.
 Was it ever gonna be
anything else?
 I'm just saying that there's
the right way
 and then there's the foolish
way. Don't ever do it
 that way again.
 - You're a fucked way.
- Yeah.
 Does that hurt?
 You wouldn't notice
if a bus hit you.
 All right, let's just do this
and get out of here.
 In here.
 Find anything?
 Not yet. You?
 Ohhh.
 - Hippity-hop.
- Nice.
 Cool.
 Roman Godfrey in my house.
 Um...
 We're looking for some mail
that might have come for Lisa.
 Why?
 We think someone might have
killed her.
 Oh. Someone like you.
 Touché.
 Shut the fuck up--
 - Are you the ones
that dug up my sister?
 I don't care.
Like that's so much worse
 than what already happens to you
when you die?
 Mom's taking Gary
to be put down.
 - What?
- Gary.
 Mom can't handle
having a dog around.
 And Dad, he can't handle the thought
of having the dog Lisa loved
 so much being with new owners.
 Seems like a bit much for a
Boston terrier, don't you think?
 It does.
 You guys didn't look
 over here.
 Is this what you're looking for?
I found it
 in Lisa's sock drawer when I was
looking for leggings.
 I thought it was an invitation to a
rave, so I begged her to take me,
 but she wouldn't.
 So I looked at her,
 so fucking pretty,
 and I said that I hope
she ends up in a dumpster.
 OK.
 I already showed it
to my parents.
 They just got pissed. They'd rather
believe she was killed by an animal.
 It's easier,
 I guess.
 "Fun, fun, fun."
 What the hell is Castle
 Godfrey?
 The mill. That's what people
call the old steel mill.
 All right, thanks. This is... this
is very helpful. We should go.
 - Yeah, mm-hmm.
- Why do you care
 who did this? Why are you
looking for him?
 'Cause when we find him,
 he's going to be joining Gary.
 I need to know if you're taking
this as seriously as I am.
 My name is on this.
 This thing put my name on this.
 Your family's name.
 This matters to me as much
as it matters to you.
 But if you end up in jail,
you better reconsider that hair.
 I'm just saying.
 I'll just point 'em
towards your lips.
 Oh.
 Do you believe everything
happens for a reason?
 Man, I try not
to fuckin' think about it.
 What's up?
 Oh, Lynda.
 She needs some help
back at home.
 Water heater or some shit.
 We'll reconvene?
Go to the mill later?
 What, is that a problem?
 Man's gotta do...
 Yeah, Tyler's gonna
love that white streak.
 We gotta figure this hair out
for your date tonight.
 It'll be fine. We're just
going to the movies.
 That shit just keeps coming back.
It's like retarded zombie hair.
 I think your hair's
really pretty the way it is.
 It's what's different about you
that's gonna make him remember you.
 You've already got
 all kinds of mystery.
Seriously.
 That's just
my professional opinion.
 - What.
- Ever.
 Wow. OK.
 Look...
 I'm-I'm sorry, but...
do you really not know
 how pretty you are?
 The world already has two
of them.
 We really don't need a third.
 What a bitch.
 Ugh. Do their tramp stamps
match too?
 - Did that cunt just say that?
- That cunt just totally said that.
 One for sorrow, two for joy,
 three for girl, four for boy,
five for silver,
 six for gold, seven for a secret
never to be...
 told.
 It's OK, it's OK. It's OK.
 She's very... It's all right,
she's very nice.
 Shelley, darling, come on.
 Psst!
 - It's OK.
- Remember, Shelley,
 the cruelty of children is
easily ignored.
 I finally tracked it down
at UT--
 only college in the world with
a library of Romany studies.
 Guess it's racist to call them
gypsies. What isn't these days?
 - Mm.
- Find what you're looking for?
 Rarely.
 Well, thank you for your...
 efforts.
 Thank you.
 So, I did some more digging.
 I asked my dad like a million
questions about Aunt Olivia--
 - Whoa, whoa. What is that?
 Peanut butter and lime yogurt mixed
together with gummy bears and extra M&Ms.;
 Bite?
 Screw it, I say.
Bring on the maternity pants.
 I mean, I don't know
what picture of Dorian Gray
 you have to hide away for your butt to
look as good as Olivia's at her age.
 Can you imagine?
 Besides, abstinence is
way overrated.
 What, you don't think
she's hot?
 Not my type.
 And he's a liar.
 Anyway, when Olivia was
my dad's patient...
 - What?
- Didn't say anything.
 OK. Well, I got the sense
she had some major problems
 before Roman was born--
after the first baby.
 There was a girl
before Roman and Shelley.
 Her name was Juliet.
She died as an infant.
 Died how?
 Uh, off topic. Go on.
 But in the end it was JR
who totally lost his grip.
 I guess he made some pretty wild
accusations about her.
 Like what?
 Dad wouldn't say. Must have been
some serious crazy-person stuff.
 There was a suicide letter too.
 They found it the next day.
 Do you have any idea
what it might have said?
 I don't know.
 I got from the look on his face
that it was time to change
 the subject.
 Godfreys have that look down.
 Yep. Mm-hmm.
 How much do you think Roman knows
about where Olivia came from?
 Isn't that a better question
to ask Roman?
 I thought you two were...
whatever it is that you
 call that you're doing.
 You keep thinkin', Butch.
 It's what you're good at.
 So, I'm thinking
the Rag & Bone scuba skinnies
 with, like, a tunic top.
 Yeah, that definitely brands
earthy yet sorta sexy. Mm-hmm.
 Yo.
 Attention deficit?
 Guys. Baby bump
 and teen wolf.
 Better check that fetus for
Lyme ticks is all I'm saying.
 Or kennel cough.
 Mm, I think
 I'm developing...
reflux disease.
 - I have to meet my grandmother
across the road. - Wait, what?
 - Where are you going?
- You still have to try on...
 - Christina!
- Don't you know them?
 What--
 - What are we gonna do with her?
- I don't--
 - Oh, they just think
I'm a werewolf too.
 People suck.
 Such a talent.
 His French verse
far more nuanced
 than his native German.
No one described the inanimate
 as beautifully
as good old Rainer.
 Ah!
 What?
 Let me ask you a question.
 Do you think you pose a risk
to yourself
 or to others?
 I'm asking you because...
 I'm thinking
about releasing you.
 You're gonna send me
back out there.
 You don't wanna go?
 Today I've seen the Dragon.
 Yeah... I saw it too.
 Yeah, the fuck you did.
 Well, tell me more
about what you see.
 It's things that...
 that aren't right.
 What kind of things?
 The baby in the blood pouch.
 The river glowing red.
 A dog hatching
out of a big black egg.
 A demon with a crown of light.
 A needle the size of a sword.
 This needle, was it...
 some kind of drug?
 This isn't about
 goddamn drugs.
 This is some
 evil, unnatural shit that's got
no business happening.
 You think this is just some
 junkie bullshit? Heh, ask one
of the other guys. See how
 they're sleeping. I even got a name for
you-- saw it on a chart next to mine.
 Varga, H.
 OK, you talk to H-fucking-Varga before you
sit there and look at me like I'm full
 of shit.
I'm gonna be
 real nice for you if...
 Just get rid of me.
 Francis, please.
I'm here to help you. I'm...
 I'm a doctor.
 And I just want
 to help...
 someone.
 Then make it go away.
 Excuse me, Dr. Godfrey,
you have an urgent phone call.
 Feeling better?
 Shelley, give Mommy a moment.
 Do look more
inconvenienced, Norman.
 It's terribly flattering.
 Why don't you drink
this electrolytes concoction?
 You're probably
just dehydrated.
 I'm still feeling...
rather lightheaded.
 We should get you
to the hospital.
 No.
 No hospital.
 I'll be healthy as a horse
after a nap.
 Hm.
 Olivia,
 why didn't you call your son?
 Because I called you.
Is that such a crime?
 No.
 But driving without this...
 ...is.
 You know, when I fell,
 I had a vision of you
striking that man.
 It was not unpleasant.
 I'm gonna drive you
and Shelley back.
 And then I have to go.
 Do you understand?
 No one's expecting more,
darling.
 Wipe your feet.
Stay a moment.
 What'd I just tell you?
 I've already cancelled
two patients.
 Mm. Some other hospitals
still stand in your absence.
 Must be a terrible blow
to your ego.
 I am gonna call a cab
and I'll wait at the corner.
 You will do no such thing.
 Do be civilized,
for Christ's sake.
 What's the worst thing you think
can happen from waiting inside?
 I have to go.
 Mm, yes, yes, you've said that.
 Olivia, was this staged?
 Oh, God. Wouldn't you
just love to think so?
 As though I would
leverage my health
 and my daughter's safekeeping
as a snare for your attention.
 You, um, you've been taking
the pills?
 What bloody business is that
of yours?
 Well, it is my bloody business
if you make it.
 You are the
 - stubbornest man I know.
- Huh.
 No one can make you do
anything you don't want.
 Come inside, darling. Hm?
 Not because I want you to.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 Um, your mother fainted
at the library.
 Are you all right?
Why didn't you call me?
 I'm... very tired.
 Uh, be a dear
 and run your uncle back
to wherever, would you?
 Come on, Uncle.
 Is she really OK?
 How would you say she's doing?
In general.
 I don't know.
 Psychotic?
 So, yeah.
 - How are you doing?
- Do you have any idea
 who might have impregnated
my daughter?
 If I did, he'd be at the
bottom of the river by now.
 Unfortunately,
 I don't know any more than you.
 Would you tell me if you did?
 Yeah.
 Does she seem
 happy to you? Letha.
 As happy as I've ever
seen her, I guess.
 Do you think that's some kind
 - of... red flag?
- Probably just
 hormonal euphoria.
 Ha! I don't know.
 I'm watching out for her.
 I want you to know that.
I always will.
 Good.
 Good.
 - Hey, Roman.
- Hey.
 Muah.
 Uh, we ran into each other
in town.
 - So I see.
- We got some frozen yogurt.
 - I had another sick craving.
- In your condition.
 I can only imagine.
 Maybe I had to be there.
 I'd better get going.
You two keep out of trouble, OK?
 Stay frosty.
 Thank you.
 See ya.
 It was just a ride home.
 Yeah, got it.
 Got a flashlight?
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
 Bon nuit, mon frère.
 That was possibly the worst
movie I have ever seen ever.
 Come on.
You loved it.
 I so did not even.
 What do you mean?
I saw you laughing in the dark.
 Stop it. I was laughing
at you laughing.
 Oh, sure, OK.
Well, why on earth
 - did you pick it?
- I did not pick it!
 You did.
 I-I don't think so.
 Your text said, and I quote,
 "Hey, you wanna check out the
matinee of Section 5 tomorrow?
 - I hear it's amazing."
- I have no recall.
 You're such a liar.
 Well, it was, uh, kind of
 amazing...ly bad.
 You're a dork.
 Well, you're on a date with a
dork, so what does that make you?
 I'll get back to you.
 You should expect
to receive an offer
 soon from a firm
called Lod, LLC.
 I'm getting an offer?
 To buy you out.
 "Well, you ordered the wrong
paint for the nursery."
 God.
 Huh.
 No one can make you do anything
you don't want.
 Ha.
 You want something?
 Um, yeah, I guess, um...
cherry coke?
 Retro. Nice. You got it!
 Thanks.
 You are safe.
 Remembering you are safe is
a positive coping strategy.
 Scared you?
 No. Kind of, a little,
not really.
 Sorry. I know it's not funny.
 It's OK.
It really is.
 Requests?
 How does it feel to have
your name on everything?
 Like a fucking pimp.
 Isn't there somewhere around back
we can park this? You know...
 Nobody gives a shit
what happens out here.
 Except us,
 right?
 Cool.
 You ever see this place
when it was running?
 My old man closed it
before I was born.
 Lots of people died here--
workers and shit.
 You know when you close your ears,
sometimes the sound of your heart is
 like a little man
walking through snow.
 Yep.
 Hey, what was that, uh, big
structure that was outside?
 It's a Bessemer converter.
 At one point, they made pig iron
into money.
 Do we have any idea
what we may be looking for?
 Uh... driver's license,
 social security card,
 dream journal...
 This is a joke.
Left or right?
 I don't know. Let's split up.
 I'll go this way.
 What's up?
 - Nothing.
- You find anything?
 No.
 Let's go.
 You know, it's crazy to think what it
must have been like when that thing was
 up and running. My mom said that
when she was a little girl,
 they couldn't hang
their sheets outside
 'cause they'd go all black.
 - I went in there once.
- No, you did not.
 I did. My friends and I were
just messing around
 on the tracks one day
and... we just went for it.
 Whoa. What's it like?
 I mean, it's...
 pretty much just big
and empty and gross--
 except for this, like,
 giant, like, black...
 cauldron thing they used
to make steel in.
 They call it a Bessemer.
 Double, double,
toil and trouble.
 Looks like a big black egg
with a hole at the top.
 It's still there,
but now it's on its side,
 supposedly... you know,
cursed or whatever because
 it crushed someone, and all his
 guts and intestines spilled
out of his mouth,
 and he was alive all the while,
and he was choking on it and...
 Oh, my god.
 I wanted to check it out,
you know?
 Peek inside.
 - I put my head in.
- You stuck your head in it?
 Well, you know, just...
 gathering material.
 - Do it, Chrissie!
- Chrissie, go do it!
 - Go into it!
- Go for it, Chrissie!
 Go, keep going.
 - Keep going!
- Go on, Chrissie,
 - do it! Do it!
- Do it!
 Oh, you're really brave.
 You're gonna be
an amazing writer.
 I hope so.
 Sorry, sorry.
God, sorry.
 Just... I-I thought
it was cool.
 Do you?
 OK.
 Feeling better?
 You summoned.
 What's Pryce up to?
 Mm, as long as I'm apprised
of quarterlies,
 I concern myself
with as little as possible
 - with whatever it is Pryce does.
- My daughter has
 expressed an interest in pursuing
treatment at the institute.
 Sensible.
 It won't happen while I'm alive.
 Darling, you're looking at me
like I'm supposed to argue
 something that's none
of my goddamn business.
 Well, someone had to approve
 the new obstetrics wing.
 Simply an option if she doesn't
prefer to give birth in a manger.
 What about this bid
to buy me out?
 Lod, LLC.
That's your business.
 First I've heard of it.
 When you're lying
about something
 I know that you know,
what exactly do you
 - expect me to believe?
- In my experience,
 people believe what they wish
 regardless
of your encouragement.
 Have we exhausted the reasons you
can pretend you called me here?
 This isn't
what you think it is.
 Oh.
 Mm. My mistake.
 Ah. Does that help you
get it up these days?
 - Is it OK?
- Is it OK?

 Ow! Fuck! What are you d--

 Stop! What the hell are you
doing?! Stop! Ow! Ow! Stop it!
 Ah! Ah! Ah!
 Ah! Ahhh!
 Ahh! Ahhh!
 I gotta go and pick up
some paint.
 For the nursery.
 No VOC.
 Canar... Canary Linen.
 Why are you telling me this,
darling?
 I don't know.
 All right, I'm done.
Let's get out of here.
 We haven't found anything.
 Yeah. I'm good with that.
 Let's just keep looking.
 Aw.
 I hate rats.
 You hear that?
 Yeah, do you smell that?
 Ugh.
 Ugh!
 - Hey.
- Yeah?
 What the fuck is that?
 It's... it's
Lisa Willoughby.
 I'd like to go.
 - Who the fuck comes in here?
- I don't know.
 It's your fucking mill.
 Should we tell someone?
 Tell them what?
 I dunno.
 Shit!
 I'll deal with it.
 Just do it, OK?
 Don't fuck around.
 You've made your point.
 Where?
 What are you talking about?
 You said you ran into Letha
in town. Where?
 Jesus Christ! Come on!
 Was she helping out
with the water heater too?
 They're gonna find your car.
 You should've told me you were
into the pregnant thing.
 - I could've hooked you up.
- Roman, she's your cousin!
 I don't like secrets.
 Hey, you might as well
get your tight ass out here!
 'Cause I'm gonna be real pissed
if I have to go in there!
 XK Douchebag.
 Master Godfrey's,
if memory serves. Little fucker.
 Just get rid of them.
 Please!
 Since you said the magic word.
 Fuck.
 Well, olly, olly, oxen free.
 - Can I help you gentlemen?
- Well, maybe you could start
 by telling us what the hell
you're doing out here.
 Well, gee, I was sitting quietly
by myself playing solitaire.
 I hope wasn't disturbing anyone.
 You think we won't run you in,
you damn little punk?
 Come on, just do it.
Do the creepy roofie eyes.
 Yeah, what does that say?
 We know what it says.
 - OK, I'll-I'll level with you.
- What are you doing?
 I was actually jacking off
to French postcards
 of your mother, and, uh, would
prefer a little privacy.
 So, if you wouldn't mind
pissing off
 - and staying away from my property--
- Best news I got all week.
 Well, you looking at something
in there, little pretty boy? Hm?
 Oh, you got a friend in there?
Huh? At the request
 of Olivia Godfrey, I'm placing
you under arrest for trespassing
 on private property.
 Our mistake.
Everyone knows
 fuck-face doesn't have
any friends.
 Yes?
 Mm, yes, this is.
 He what?!
 No, no, no.
 Where are the keys?
 Why?! Fuck!
 What are you doing?!
What are you--
 What are you doing?
 You asshole.
