 What are you doing here?
 It's funny...
 I've passed this place
a thousand times, and...
 I never gave a second thought
as to who might live here.
 Why would you?
 - I'm not what you think I am.
- Hm.
 And, uh...
 what is it that you think
I think you are?
 I wonder if he can see us
right now.
 He sees what he chooses to.
 Did you know
 that the wettest place
on earth...
 ...is a small
garden island...
 ...in Hawaii?
 Hey, hey, Robbie, man,
check it out.
 No. Please, please,
I didn't mean to...
 I didn't meant to say...
No, no. No, no, please. No.
 No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to...
 Wake up.
 OK.
 Look.
 My book.
 - I saw... I saw you.
- She said she was over it.
 Maybe we should
call her parents.
 No! Her parents being
her parents--that's why
 - she's staying with us.
- Hehe... I didn't think
 it was real. I didn't want...
No, it wasn't real,
 it wasn't real...
 Are you...
 Are you a werewolf?
 - Oh, OK, you know what--
- No, Alyssa!
 - What?
- If you wake up a person
 that's dreaming that they're
dying, they actually die.
 - No, they don't.
- Alyssa, they do.
 - Alexa, where did you get that from?
- I saw it on the internet.
 No!
 Dad!
 It's OK. Shh, shh.
It's OK.
 :Black fur,
yellow eyes,
 five to six feet in height,
 torso roughly the size
of a smallish pony.
 Francis, can I ask
your proximity to the animal?
 Twenty paces.
 You were in open ground?
 Trees. I ran for the trees.
 The tree line is triple
that distance.
 Well, forgive my fucking
depth perception.
 In moonlight.
 Francis, were you
under the influence of alcohol
 or any narcotics that night?
 I saw what I saw.
 The doctor is just trying to
get all of the facts, Francis.
 Today I have
 seen the dragon.
 - Don't touch him.
- It's OK.
 You.
 It was you.
 I don't want to see that.
 I don't want to see that!
 I'd like to believe you,
 but given the physical...
 improbability of what it is
you saw, is there anything
 you could tell us that could
not have been fabricated
 from any number
of newspaper or TV reports?
 You come from a place where
it was OK to call a man a liar?
 You were in the 24th infantry?
 Yeah.
 I was in the 16th.
 Ramadi.
 You didn't ask to see
what you've seen.
 But people who've been to places
that we've been to,
 we see things
in a different way.
 And if there is a single bit
of forensic evidence
 that you can remember...
 ...it would go a long way
in making sure
 this doesn't happen
again, Francis.
 Snatch.
 The demon dog went
for her lady part first.
 Your wings...
 are wet.
 Excuse me?
 Hospital coffee.
 The miracles of modern medicine
still can't pour water over beans.
 Well, it's the grind,
not the pour.
 So, what do you make
of our demon dog?
 I would say there's
no question Mr. Pullman suffers
 from typical
dissociative symptoms
 associated with severe
psychological trauma.
 He was right about the murder.
 The animal did go snatch-first.
 Well, I didn't say
I thought he was wrong.
 He's seen other things
that are...
 corroborated.
 Francis.
 Well, I won't take up
any more of your time.
 But if you were me...
 what would you do next?
 The creature he described didn't seem
especially probable to me either.
 I would go
 to the most likely place
it would have come from--
 if he really saw what he saw.
 The town's other
medical facility.
 The conspicuously phallic one.
 The White Tower.
 Wouldn't be the first
improbable thing
 to come out of there.
 Oh, I'd encourage you
not to make an appointment.
 If I'm not mistaken,
 your name is on the side
of the building.
 Or mention my name.
 Oh, and ask to speak
to Dr. Johann Pryce.
 Good morning,
 sister!
 Morning, darling.
 There was a time when the breakfast table
was a place for civilized conversation.
 I have some business to attend.
 You need to give your sister
a ride.
 Uh, I have plans after school.
 Indeed.
 Giving your sister a ride.
 Your visitor last night.
It seemed the two of you had
 - rather a lot to talk about.
- Oh, yeah.
 We're building a diorama
of the solar system.
 Mercury, Mars...
 Uranus.
 Don't encourage him.
 Strange.
 He told me he was here
to finish an English assignment.
 Yep.
 That's what I said.
 What was his business here?
 OK.
 You win, Mom. I've been waiting
for the right time
 to tell you, but without all the
fiery passion of your disapproval.
 We take turns playing Juliet. I hope the
headboard didn't make too much noise.
 what you track into this house
 you will scrub from the floor.
 Have you ever made a threat so cryptic
you yourself don't understand it?
 I will not have that filth in my house!
 All right, I'm going to school.
 Can I pick up some new batteries
for your vibrator?
 I hope you're proud
 of your foulness
at your own mother.
 Imagine that whatever comes
out of my mouth next is
 exactly what you want to hear.
All right?
 Come on, Shel.
 Have a good day at school,
darling.
 I am dismayed to report
this is not the only evidence
 of a general decline
in mother's temper lately.
 Roman and I made a quick stop
en route to school,
 and who should we encounter
but Jenny from the club.
 To my surprise,
 she was ringing up a sale
at the jewelry counter.
 But Jenny looked at me with
a distinct lack of enthusiasm
 and only the barest nod
of recognition.
 Of course I was crushed
 and wracked my brains for any
offense I may have caused her.
 My first assumption, as always,
is that it was my own fault.
 Missed you at the club
the other night.
 Well, your psycho mother got
me fired.
 She's a farm-fresh cunt.
 You're bad.
 I was horrified,
 both at mother's rashness
 and Roman.
Within our walls is one thing,
 but to talk so
in a public setting...
 Do you know what would look
fabulous on you?
 But then she turned
to me and smiled,
 and my dejection was immediately
an un-mourned memory.
 So elegant.
 Just waiting
for the perfect lady.
 Come here.
 Astonishing how
much of the world's troubles can
 be erased by the simplest smile
 and the feeling of something
precious against one's cheek.
 Ah,jolie fille! What do
you think, big brother?
 I think my sister deserves
a diamond as big as the Ritz.
 But Mom would shit
a bowling ball.
 Don't tell me you're becoming
the responsible one.
 Who told you anything about us?
 But of course Roman
was right about how mother would
 receive this gesture,
and even he picks his battles.
 There's a dread to even
the calms of this family lately,
 and I cannot escape the feeling
 if things continue
on this course, it is building
 to some fearful and mysterious
and irreparable end.
 Car 2, respond to the corner
of Oslo and 5th.
 Female caller is on scene.
 Report of suspicious behavior
in the alley
 behind the mini-mart.
 Car 2, we're two blocks north
of that location.
 We'll turn up the alley
and see what we can see.
 Dispatch, this is Sworn.
I'm about a hundred yards south
 of Mile Marker 4 on the county
fire access road. Hikers found
 what looks like wolf droppings. Need
a car bring out some evidence bags.
 - You never know.
- This is Dispatch. Right away, Sheriff.
 When was it discovered?
 About an hour ago.
What are you doing here?
 I'm not here for your coffee
and pie.
 How long you think
 - it's been there?
- A week or so.
 Quite conceivably left the night
of the killing.
 Do you think it's... relevant?
 One way to find out.
 I'm too old for this.
 No bone matter,
undigested fabric...
 But what do we have here?
 - Is that animal?
- You a betting man?
 Could run it up
to Godfrey's mausoleum
 and get Dr. Pryce's people
to take a look.
 Hm. Enough tongues wagging
as it is.
 Mind if I take a look?
 Wow.
 Guess you never know what might
come up, huh?
 That's quite the setup--
 fish and game-wise.
 Mm.
 Lucky for me, I guess, we send
 our forensic evidence
out to Pittsburgh.
 They got a... lab there.
 Solid.
 Top... drawer.
 You got anything?
 Well, I can't tell much
from the hair
 since it's partially digested
so the root isn't present.
 I need the root
for an in-depth analysis.
 We'll send it out,
see what they can find.
 Not your first rodeo, huh?
 Jack of all trades--
master of none.
 But you... can't find
anything?
 Well, it's certainly human.
Uh, probably female.
 - You can tell the sex?
- Just assumption. It's, uh,
 six inches long.
 Right.
 - Sheriff?
- Yeah?
 Can I interest you
in a glass of rye?

 Psh. Forty years
of Gloria Steinem
 so that some anorexic can
teach girls that it's all about
 losing weight
and pleasing men. Jeez.
 I mean, if we don't make it
easier on ourselves, who will?
 It doesn't have to be this hard.
 It doesn't cost anything
to ask.
 I think purple with a purpose
is not your color.
 OK. It's on, bitch.
 Hey. Where you going?
 Hey. Bus.
 Godfreys don't ride buses.
 Aren't you the gallant one.
 All right, he's got two.
Now let's try three.
 All right. Oh, and he's doing
three at a time! Oh, no, no!
 - He doesn't do it! He doesn't do it.
- Terrible.
 Got any other tricks?
 Not with the ladies present.
 Have you met my cousin Letha?
 No.
 Peter.
 Hey.
 If the circus is
over, let's get going.
 Come on, Shel.
 What?
 Nothing.
 Remember that guy lying in the
road the night of the dance?
 The one who saw Brooke Bluebell?
 Yeah.
 Ouroboros.
 I seen that cheerleader.
I saw her get killed.
 Today I've seen the Dragon.
 I was thinking maybe you could
talk to your pops,
 see if you can find out more
about him.
 Like what?
 Like, um, something that might
not have made the papers.
 What are you two up to?
 That's on a need-to-know
basis.
 - Hunting the demon dog.
- No, you're not.
 There are mitigating
circumstances.
 We think the demon dog might
actually be a person.
 Are you high?
 Beside the point.
 - This guy is hurting people.
- OK.
 - A, it's not a guy. It's an it.
- Shh.
 B, say you had a single good
reason to think it was a person,
 you can't seriously think you're better off
chasing him than a trained professional.
 And C,
 what do you think a psychiatric
patient's gonna be able to tell you?
 Is that a yes?
 Say it was a person.
 What do you imagine you're gonna
do when you find him?
 What do you think, sweetheart?
Put him in the pound.
 Can I ask what possible good you
think is gonna come from this?
 No.
 Hey. Why did you say
demon dog?
 It calls less attention to seem like you're
a retard than you're hiding something.
 People paying attention to me isn't the
same as people paying attention to you.
 All right.
Meet you at midnight.
 You bring the shovels,
I'll bring the rest.
 Jesus, Nicolai. Speak now
or forever hold your peace.
 Hey.
 How are ya?
How was your day?
 Weird day,
 month, whatever. Yours?
 Oh, it was OK. I, uh, I ran into your
friend's mom at the general store.
 Well, you know what they say
 about small towns.
 Yeah. Yeah, I think
she was looking for me.
 Yeah?
 Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
 The woman was trying to act sly, but
you could smell the desperation.
 I mean, she must've gone through
the last of what Vince sold her.
 You know? But she can't
bring herself to ask
 someone like me for more.
 - She wants my stuff.
- I suppose you could just give it to her.
 What would be the fun in that?
 I got duck.
 I thought I would make something
fancy schmancy tonight.
 Ah, I'm going out.
 I know.
 You know, your grandfather
Nicolai was very proud of you.
 You know that?
 Do you remember
when that picture was taken?
 No, I can't.
 - See you later.
- I love you.
 Have you been sleeping?
 - Why do you ask?
- You look...
 I would think very carefully how you
choose to finish that sentence.
 How's Norman holding up?
 What a remarkable imitation of empathy!
Have we been practicing?
 I bear him no ill will, and
the hatred he feels for me has
 the whiff of something stale
and self-annihilating.
 As a far-superior thinker
to myself once wrote,
 men cling to their hates
because they fear
 once their hates are gone, they'll
have to deal with their own self-pain.
 And the men dig,
gouge each other
 because you both imagine
one will strike oil
 while the other drowns
in his own blood.
 At any rate, have you had the opportunity
to speak with him about our friends at Lod?
 They're prepared to make a bid
for his shares.
 That's generous,
even by Godfrey standards.
 It's not the right time.
 They're getting...
rather insistent.
 More than I am?
 Hello, glowworm.
I sincerely
 apologize for any discomfort.
 Are you still feeling pain here?
 Just as long as we're
on the subject,
 we need to discuss the matter
of my niece's pregnancy.
 Certainly.
 She will require
the best treatment.
 Only the best for family.
 That's it.
Follow the light.
 Did you have a place in mind?
 You do realize we do not have
an obstetrics wing here.
 You do now.
 I expect you'll have
a contractor
 by the end of the weekend.
 Whoever the top-flight minds are
in the field, offer them...
 whatever you need to.
 Consider any budgetary requirements
for this project pre-approved.
 Norman...
 will never agree.
 Norman will agree
to what's best.
 For Letha.
 I'll start reviewing
candidates immediately.
 I, um...
 I need some fresh air.
 Uh, I'll be right outside,
darling.
 Would you like to see
something, glowworm?
 Beautiful.
 And like so many
beautiful things, deceiving.
 It grows, feeds, breathes,
and is not a living thing--
 technically speaking.
 Consider it a... preview.
 A promise of more to come.
 A gift.
 Please,
a hand.
 Soon.
 They don't carry rye here.
Is bourbon OK?
 - Don't know I could tell the difference.
- Hm. Birds fly and pigs don't.
 Excuse me, hon.
 When you get a chance.
 Sheriff, if you don't mind me asking, are
you familiar with funerary practices?
 Ashes to ashes, like that?
 - Mm. Another hobby of mine.
- You ever consider stamps?
 The history's quite
fascinating, actually.
 For instance, did you know
the ancient Egyptians were
 the first to develop the process
of embalming?
 Preserving the flesh of their deceased so
they could be welcomed by their god Osiris.
 Greeks, on the other hand,
 they anointed their dead
with perfumes and spices.
 For them, it was all
about the send-off.
 Well, you only go once,
I guess, huh?
 Really?
 Topic for another time.
 Of course, Western culture's
developed its own burial rituals.
 Like so much of modern life,
it's a hodgepodge of capitalism,
 religion, health code,
and statues.
 I don't mean
to be rude, Doctor.
 You as much as asked Peter
Rumancek if he was a werewolf.
 I don't suppose you are by
any chance a werewolf, Peter.
 I beg your pardon?
 When the moon is full, do you
walk in the skin of a wolf?
 No, sir.
 - Ma'am.- And I stood there like
it was the most sensible thing
 I'd ever heard,
which it sure as hell wasn't.
 Today, you show up uninvited
to poke through a pile of crap
 and then invite me down here for a
drink so you can explain undertaking.
 If this is some kind of joke,
it's not funny.
 The Willoughby girl's autopsy.
They fucked it up.
 What?
 They didn't collect
any usable hair samples.
 I don't recall anyone
releasing the autopsy results.
 Have a drink, Sheriff.
 One way or the other,
we're gonna need that sample.
 - She's in the ground, Doctor.
- Yes.
 And exhumation requires
a court order, parental consent.
 I doubt a convincing case could be
made for either, and regardless,
 time's a-wastin'.
 No!
 Stop. Stop.
 No, no, no.
 No!
 So, is it weird being
out in the world again?
 I'm highly medicated.
 Did they give you like
a million awesome tranquilizers?
 Topamax
for post-traumatic stress,
 Trazodone for insomnia,
 and Lexapro.
 Oh, lucky!
 I thought Lexapro was
for depression.
 Anxiety.
 Well... we could fix that.
 Refreshments.
 - Entertainment.
- I call that
 the Slutty Summer Mix of 2013.

best in the world".

 Because of her eyes.
 They were just staring
like that.
 They looked fake.
 And then when I saw that
the rest of her was missing...
 I thought...
 how could it be real?
 I thought... someone had...
 put it there for some
little girl like me to find,
 and I thought
they were filming it.
 So I thought it would be funny.
 You thought
what would be funny?
 I kissed her.
 Dizygotic twinning.
 Two eggs, two sperm.
 Twins run in my family.
 They were cheek to jaw
at the embryonic stage.
 The sad thing is they'll never be that
close to another human being again.
 What the hell is going on
in this town?
 Let's do this before I think
better of it.
 Whew.
 Did you actually dress up
as a grave robber?
 No. I dressed up
like you.
 Did you know that people used to believe the
dead came back as bloodthirsty revenants
 because the bloating
of internal organs made them,
 like... like, belch up fluid
from inside the lungs.
 Huh.
 They're coming
to get you, Barbara.
 They're coming
for you, Barbara!
 Is there like a summer school
for serial killers?
 - Shee-it.
- Shee-it.
 How many funerals
have you been to?
 A few. Rumanceks are
reliably kicking it
 as a result of positive
lifestyle choices.
 What are they like for...
for you people?
 - Funerals, I mean.
- Committed.
 You're not allowed
to eat or wash,
 mirrors are covered, and
the dead guy's stuff is burnt.
 Why?
 Because a Rumancek should not
be remembered
 for his worldly things.
 They also cut off their head.
 What?
 Things happen to our kind after
death if you don't do the head.
 - What kind of things?
- The bad kind.
 I've been to two funerals.
 One was my dad's.
 It's all pieces. I remember hearing
the shot and going downstairs.
 He was on the floor.
 I remember thinking how much
trouble he'd be in for the mess.
 That's fucked up.
 Dig.
 Where is she?
 Hold on.
 Oh, fuck me.
 Get the thing from my bag.
 Well, you want this dance?
 You're the expert.
 Here, grab the light.
 You don't deserve this.
 You make this look easy.
 What's your cousin gonna do
with that?
 What she can.
No promises.
 The other funeral...
 Yeah?
 It was Shelley's.
 Someone's here, someone's here,
someone's here, someone's here.
 Damn it.
 Come on.
 St. Jude.
 The patron saint
of hopeless causes?
 I--oh--don't suppose you
have an extra one.
 - You got people here, Sheriff?
- No, not me.
 I don't want a hole
when I go. Just roast me
 and drizzle the leavings
over the rose bushes.
 You're not much for ceremony,
I take it.
 Ah, I haven't been to a play
in years.
 Do you see that?
 Yep.
 What the hell?
 - Sheriff!
- Whoa! Ah! Ugh!
 Jesus Christ.
 Looks like someone
 beat us to it.
 May the sacred heart of Jesus...
 be adored,
 preserved, glorified, and loved
throughout the world
 now and forever.
 Amen.
 What the fuck are you doing?
 You can call it in.
 We got what we came for.
 :I have
an uneasy feeling, Uncle.
 :What is it?
 Christina was
absent from school yesterday.
 Poor innocent.
I cannot imagine what toll
 the demon dog's handiwork must
have taken on her.
 Have you heard
from her?
 I sent her a card
with a poem, but I shall not
 repeat it here. I mentioned
your name in the card,
 should she desire the audience
of a professional.
 I do hope you don't mind.
 Of course not.
 :I know
it all weighs on you, Uncle.
 The burden of it lies
between your words.
 :Don't worry
about your old uncle.
 That's the last thing you need.
 :Forgive
my presumptions,
 but when I'm making my own
reconciliations, I derive some consolation
 by remembering these words:
 "I cannot tell how it mounts
on the winds,
 "through the clouds,
and flies through heaven.
 Today I have seen the Dragon."
 - Tom?
- Jesus Christ.
 I couldn't sleep.
 Yeah... you and me both.
 How you doin'?
 A little better? I know
you've been through a lot.
 So have you.
 I know that smell.
 Yeah, don't worry about that.
 - Christina, it's really l--
- You know what I was thinking?
 What?
 Well...
 I want a felt life,
 because I want to be an author.
 So, like,
 all the horrible things
that happen to me,
 they're OK, because they just...
 bring me closer
to enlightenment.
 Sometimes when I talk to you...
 I forget
who the grown-up is.
 I'm gonna go to bed now.
 All right.
 Peter, are you ready?
 OK, tell me someone brought
the bottle.
 Who's got the bottle?
 I have it here.
 Yeah.
 Ah!
 Sweet.
 Sworn.
 [Congratulations. It's a boy.]
 What do you mean?
 The hair sample.
Didn't come from Willoughby.
 Came from a human male.
 Wonderful.
