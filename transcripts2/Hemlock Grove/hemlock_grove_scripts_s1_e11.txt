 Come on, Peter.
 Peter, Peter. Come on.
 Peter, Peter, Peter,
Peter, Peter, come on.
 Yeah, I know.
 Yeah, I'm not usually a worrier,
 but this time, you know?
 What the hell?
 What's a Godfrey want here?
 Come to buy me my beer?
 One of your deputies told me
I might find you here.
 The man's been up all night.
 Leave him in peace.
 Listen, Tom,
I can't begin to imagine
 what you're going through.
 Give us a minute.
 You know, it's hard
to believe...
 Alisha and I used to come here
before the twins.
 We'd drink...
 dance to the shittiest music.
 How's your family, Norman?
 My family?
 Marie, Letha.
They all right?
 They're the same.
 Come home with me.
 You shouldn't be alone
at a time like this.
 He look fucking alone to you?
 She sat right there.
 Who?
 Dr. Chasseur.
 Fish and Wildlife.
 Had a bug up her ass
with the Rumancek kid.
 Tom, whatever she told you--
 - She as much as accused him
of being a werewolf.
 Me being a civilized man,
I laughed it off.
 As you should
since it's bloody ridiculous.
 She called me
about a hair sample,
 male. What the hell
was I supposed to do with that?
 Listen.
 There is an explanation
for this
 and it's not the supernatural.
 OK.
 Good.
 Let's go.
 I just...
 - Tom.
- No. No.
 Fuck it.
 We all know that these killings
 started after these Rumanceks
moved in.
 You're just buying
into this madness.
 The town's riled up as it is.
 Think about Christina.
 I am.
 Down by the creek, Kimmel Lane.
 That's where they fucking live.
 - [Lynda, I have a bad feeling.]
- Huh?
 Here we go! Woo!
 - Yeah, party time.
- Yeah, let's go!
 Oh, shit!
They're already here.
 - Woo!
- Hey, anybody home?
 - Come on out.
- Yeah! Come on!
 Yeehaw!
 Yeah, baby!
 Knock! Knock! Anybody home?
 Wasn't so bad now, was it?
 Your dogcatcher
has been taken care of.
 Will there be anything else?
 Not yet.
 Though I really...
 must change first.
 - Ah!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's OK.
 It's OK. You're OK.
 You're OK.
 I saw it.
 I mean I saw you.
 Wh-what?
 Changing back from...
you know.
 It was fucking beautiful.
 If you say so.
 Ahhh...
 My head feels like a goddamn
 war dance is inside of it.
 Did you drag me back here?
 Last I saw, you were down.
 - Down?
- Chasseur shot you with a dart.
 Oh, Chasseur!
 She was gonna take you away.
 I, I tried to tell her
how it wasn't you but...
 Fuck! Fuck!
 What?
 I should have been stronger
for you.
 - Stronger?
- I tried to stop her,
 I did, but she had a gun.
 So I left.
But then I circled back,
 but by then you were gone.
 Then my fucking mom calls,
 says to come back home
and keep an eye on you.
 - Your mom?
- Yeah.
 Two weeks in a fucking coma,
and she didn't even ask me
 how I felt. Weird, huh?
 - I'm, I'm no judge.
- Anyway...
 I get back home
and there you are,
 but she's gone.
 There's something else.
 - Letha?
- No, no, no.
 She's fine.
 Alexa and Alyssa Sworn?
 The vargulf got
the sheriff's daughters.
 Shit.
 Have you heard from my mom?
 What do you mean?
 Fuckers know about me,
they gotta know about her.
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey! Stay here. Stay here.
 I'll check on the trailer,
make sure she's all right, OK?
 Yeah, OK. Whatever.
Just go, please.
 All right.
 Hello?
 Hello?
 - Hey!
- Oh, shit!
 Gypsies need a way out!
 You OK?
 Yeah. How's Peter?
 Uh, he, he's fine.
 - He's fine.
- Ah! Just like Peter.
 All right, well...
 funny thing is that compared
to most places
 in the world,
this place is hog heaven.
 Um, can you get
that chandelier?
 And that plate
with the shells on it?
 They took my money.
 Close call, huh?
 Yeah. Um...
 Destiny gave me a head's up.
 How would she know
anything about it?
 Oh, well, she, uh...
 she has her way.
 Where's the picture?
 Do you see a picture
of Nicolae?
 Here it is. Um...
 OK.
 Peter slept at the house.
 - You can just follow me up there.
- Uh, yeah, no, no.
 I don't, I don't think so.
I think, uh...
 the Rumanceks and the Godfreys
 are a little too close
for my comfort.
 What's that supposed to mean?
 Oh, whoa! Can anyone smell smoke here?
 If you want to help Peter,
keep him away
 from the animals that did this.
 - Yeah?
- [Yeah, it's me.]
 Your mom's OK...
but the trailer looks like
 the last time Shelley
took dancing lessons.
 Shit.
 How are you feeling?
 Actually, I'm fucking starving.
 All right.
 Hey, baby.
 - Where you gonna go?
- I don't know.
 Oh! I hope
you're not allergic to cats.
 Peter loves that cat.
 Hey. Hey, come here, buddy.
 It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.
 Shh, shh, shh.
 Huh.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah.
 Ah! Ah...
 I came to check on Roman.
 How is it possible
to miss someone so much
 after one day, huh?
 I think you're supposed
to be mad at me.
 Who says I'm not?
 Oh, so you're mad at me?
 Are boys always this stupid?
 You're a jerk!
 Mm!
 Peter...
 the sheriff's daughters.
 I heard.
 My dad called this morning.
 He sounded really scared...
 like he just wanted
to know I was OK.
 OK.
 What do we do now?
 I guess we just stand here like
this until something else happens.
 Come on, let's go.
 Son of a bitch!
They're inside.
 - [Which way?]
- Check the greenhouse.
 Yeah. Copy that.
 Peter, they think
you killed them?
 Cops don't think.
 Come on, front door.
 - Hey!
- No, no, no, no. Come on.
 - Whoa! - No, no. Come on.
- Where are we going?
 To the woods. Whenever you're
in trouble, head for the woods.
 Stop fucking now!
 Motherfucker!
 Both of you, turn around,
 hands in the air.
 I won't say it again.
 That's that.
 The place looks empty.
You all right?
 Just dandy. Unlike
this piece of murdering shit.
 - Move aside.
- He didn't do anything.
 Bullshit, he didn't.
 Peter Rumancek,
 you have the right
to remain fucked.
 If you choose
to waive that right,
 further fucking will be provided
for you free of charge.
 - Don't!
- You shut up. You know,
 I should do you right here,
you little scum.
 I've known Tom Sworn's
girls all their lives.
 - I said leave him!
- Ah! Get off!
 You do that again, I'm gonna
break his goddamn neck.
 Pula va cadea.
 What the fuck was that?
 Oh, you'll get the joke
when your dick falls off.
 Ha! Ha! Ha! Funny boy, huh?
 Uh...
 Shelley.
 Oh, that's fucking perfect.
 Go! Get the hell out of here!
 Oh, brilliant!
 It's OK, Shel.
 - Ho-ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
- Roman...
 you're awake?
 Stay back. What are you doing?
 You have a gun pointed at the back
of your head. Do not, repeat,
 - do not turn around!
- Roman, be careful.
 - You think I won't?
- Put the gun in your mouth.
 Come back here!
What the fuck are you doing?
 - Uncuff him.
- Screw you!
 If he's still handcuffed
by the time I count to three,
 pull the trigger.
 One.
 - Two!
- OK, OK!
 Just calm down, buddy.
 What the fuck, man?
 Come here.
 Get in your car
 and take the 79
to the West Virginia state line.
 When you get there...
 you can take the gun
out of your mouth,
 And you...
 will punch yourself
in the face hard enough
 to break your nose.
 Bye now.
 What the fuck?
 Roman.
 Roman, what did you do to them?
 I just suggested they
relocate. You're not safe here.
 No shit.
 Norman...
 I believe
we have a matter to discuss.
 It's not a good time, Liv.
 Of course it isn't.
 If you...
if you ask me to leave,
 - I will.
- No.
 No, I don't want you to leave.
 Can I get you something?
 I certainly didn't
 come all this way
so you could fetch me a coffee.
 Do you understand why I'm here?
 Your motives are never
far from the surface.
 You heard about
the sheriff's girls?
 Yes.
 A tragedy.
 And, judging from your mood,
 one for which
you inexplicably feel culpable.
 No. No, not culpable. Just...
 ...useless.
 You know,
I went to see him, Tom.
 I mean not as a doctor,
as a friend, and even as that,
 I couldn't do a damn thing
to relieve his pain.
 I wonder...
 is that how my brother felt
that night outside the tower?
 - You're nothing like JR.
- No.
 Since he was,
for all his faults,
 a singularly decisive man.
 Perhaps a... a coffee
 would be in order after all.
 Six months.
 Oh...
 Because you understand
 that my wife's only crime
 was giving the best years
of her life to a man
 who fell out of love with her,
 which happened
the moment I first laid
 eyes on you.
 Yeah,
 six months should be enough
to acquit my obligations.
 Letha will have had her baby. There
will of course be an equitable
 financial arrangement
for all concerned and then...
 ...I will leave Marie.
 I will become a grandfather. Ha!
 And I will marry you.
 My dear Norman.
 Dr. Godfrey? I'm sorry but
 - it's time for your meeting.
- I'll be out in a moment.
 No, no, stay, stay.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
 If only I could.
 Go about your day, darling.
 Uh, there will be...
 there will be time
for the rest later.
 Wait!
 I mean it this time.
 What makes you think
I don't know that?
 Letha?
 - [Hi, Dad.]
- What's wrong?
 [Roman's awake.]
 Where the hell are we?
 I used to take walks
back here with my dad.
 This is all part
of Hemlock Acres?
 Well, it's a relief
to see you up and about, Roman.
 But you - or you -
 should have told me.
- I'm sorry, Dad,
 things have been
a little crazy.
 Glad to see you're
all right. Letha told me.
 What that mob did
to your home was a disgrace.
 Well, the place
needed a tune-up.
 Come on.
 Yeah... we closed this
 when we opened the new sanctuary
three years ago.
 Didn't get a chance
to clean it up.
 Anyway, won't have
to worry about anyone
 checking the ashtrays.
 Ha.
 - What?
- Uh, you know,
 it's just been
a month of Sundays.
 We didn't know who else to ask.
 I know that this could cause
trouble for you.
 Well, making bad decisions is
one of the perks of ownership.
 The town has lost its mind.
 Peter should stay here
until this lunacy dies down.
 Thank you.
 You two try and find a hole
 that's not an inch deep in dust.
 And Roman?
 Give me a hand?
 All right.
 What the FUCK is going on?
 - It's just that sometimes--
- You do not get to hold back,
 not when my daughter
is involved!
 Sometimes a wolf goes crazy
 and doesn't eat what it kills.
 When you say wolf,
 - what exactly do you mean?
- I mean werewolf.
 You do realize you're talking
to a clinical psychiatrist,
 not some fucking witch doctor?
 Assume, just for a moment,
 that what I'm saying is true,
OK? Then what?
 - Is it Peter?
- No.
 Does Letha know
what you're doing?
 Sort of, but I, I don't think
she really believes it either.
 So you two have been trying
to what, find this -
 Ha! Ha! Ha! - bad werewolf?
 - Vargulf. - Excuse me?
- Vargulf, what they call it.
 And he's not bad really.
He's just sick.
 - But you didn't find him?
- Not yet.
 And that's because...?
 I was in a coma.
 Right.
 Supposing you
just sum up for me
 what you've actually
learned about this...
 - vargulf.
- There isn't much,
 but we have time...
 before the next full moon.
 In the meanwhile,
we keep that one away
 from the torches
and the pitchforks.
 Is that the idea?
 Is this you deciding whether you
should have us all committed?
 Actually I was just thinking that
fatherhood is fucking overrated,
 and that your friend is
gonna need some blankets.
 Oh, by the way,
 have you spoken
to your mother recently?
 Why?
 No reason.
 - Does your mom know you're OK?
- She doesn't give a shit.
 Sorry. I didn't know
you were here.
 Hello?
 Anyone home?
 She's not safe.
 What?
 She and the baby aren't safe.
 You think that monster
doesn't want her too?
 I don't know
anything about that.
 Wait here. Hey!
 Hey, you better get some meds
over here!
 I want to stay here
tonight. With you.
 I don't think so.
 Your dad,
he gave me the, the look.
 What look?
 The look that says
you're not staying here tonight.
 Since when are you an expert
on my dad's catalogue
 of facial expressions, huh?
 I gotta be good at something.
 Hey!
 It's the ring you gave me.
 It's been in my purse.
 Thought you didn't like it.
 - No. I didn't like YOU then.
- Hmm...
 Hello.
 Hey!
 They were in their beds, Peter.
 Whatever it was got in
without being seen
 to do that to them.
 It's no wild animal.
 What kind of person
has it in them...
 ...to do that?
 I think
that we all have it in us...
 ...but some worse than others.
 Still.
 The mystery of death
isn't a bad thing, hey?
 Without it we wouldn't
have this.
 Come here.
 I love you.
 Whoa!
 In a church?
 That look.
 Hospitals have
a lousy reputation for food,
 and this won't change anything.
 But it should keep you
going until morning.
 I'll be fine.
 I'm going home
to check on Shelley.
 We start over tomorrow, right?
 Mm-hmm.
 We should go.
 I love you, you know.
 This ain't so bad.
 Casper?
 Casper!
 Hey, there you are.
 Hey, that's mine.
 Dad?
 Are you all right?
 I know today's
been a lot for you.
 I'm really sorry.
 Actually I'm fine.
 I'm fine.
 Ah, there you are!
Oh, my baby!
 Sorry it's so late. I got
her back as soon as I could.
 There's a casserole
in the fridge if you're hungry.
 Ravenous!
 They were afraid of Peter.
 - Who was?
- Cook, maid.
 Everyone left.
 I'll always be here for you.
 Promise?
 Super pinkie swear.
 - Did you dream about me?
- I did.
 The whole time I was out.
 Tell me about it.
 You were exactly
like you've always been...
 more beautiful
than this world deserves.
 Come here.
 What's wrong, Shel?
 What's wrong?
 Wish I could see myself there.
 Where's mom?
 Don't know. I'm afraid.
 It's OK.
 How about we clean this up, huh?
 Nurse!
 Nurse!
 Nurse! I came to check on her.
She's gone.
 Where the hell is she?
Where the hell is she?!
 Where the hell
is Christina Wendell?!
 Liver temp's conclusive.
 She was killed
sometime last night.
 I thought I ordered a redhead.
 There was another one.
 - Another what?
- Last night, another girl.
 Who?
 They don't know yet.
No head.
 It wasn't Letha. I checked
on her before I came here.
 But it was the wrong moon.
 That's supposed
to be impossible, right?
 Yeah, maybe... maybe not.
 What do you mean? I thought
we still had time to find him.
 You need to be with Letha
at sundown tonight.
 - Why?
- I mean it.
 She's on your watch until this
is over. This is your job now.
 - Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go see Destiny.
 She knows more about the, uh...
 - the protocols than I do.
- Protocols?
 Or whatever. She might have a better
idea about this, because I sure don't!
 If you go out
in public, you'll be shot!
 - That's if you're lucky!
- Yeah, well, I'm a lucky guy.
 This is no joke!
 OK?
 Here. Call her.
 This isn't a pizza delivery.
 You go.
 OK.
 And Roman...
 I meant it... about Letha.
 Don't let the bedbugs bite.
 Hm...
 - How's my baby?
- He's safe where he is.
 No, he's not, but...
 what does he need?
 There was another murder
last night, the vargulf.
 I know, I know.
 Peter said
you were some kind of expert.
 So how is this happening?
 You really have no idea
what you are, do you?
 What the fuck's
that supposed to mean?
 OK.
 First...
 experts are the people
that you see on TV.
 And the laws of magic
are like the laws of anything,
 they work because you obey them.
 - Then you can just break them?
- Not the way you think.
 This vargulf can.
How do we fight that?
 You don't.
 I'm part of this.
 Killing him is something
I'm supposed to do.
 There are dreams so real
you can feel
 their teeth marks
when you wake up.
 And then
there's the smell of coffee.
 It's time for you to admit
that this isn't your fight.
 - People are still dying.
- That has nothing to do with it.
 So how does Peter fight him?
 The way wolves usually do.
 Then he can do the same thing?
 He can turn
when the moon is wrong?
 Not for free.
 Nothing is for free.
 Then what's the price?
 I don't know.
 Who does?
 The only person who can know
the answer is Peter.
 Not without some help he can't.
 I can give him what he needs,
but no matter what,
 it's gonna be a giant
crap sandwich for him to eat.
 Aren't there...
 protocols or something?
 Oh, Peter, Peter, Peter.
 You know, there was nothing
about this that 1,000 miles
 of interstate
couldn't have solved.
 Except when it doesn't.
 Fine.
 Don't act like we haven't
talked about this before.
 I said fine.
 What do you mean
you talked about it?
 - About Peter running away?
- Yep.
 That is not always
the best solution.
 Why?
 Did Peter tell you
about Nicolae?
 He said he killed
one of his own.
 Yeah, well...
 the brother
of the man Nicolae killed
 found us many years later,
 meaning that Nicolae
had to become a murderer
 twice in his life. The fires
go out, the coals stay hot.
 If this isn't ended, this will
be just around the corner
 for the rest of Peter's life.
 That story sounds
so much better in Romanian.
 I miss when Peter was a baby.
 If I could flip a switch, I'd
live in a whole world of babies.
 I'm gonna help him
through this.
 Wait.
 Tell Peter I love him, OK?
 OK.
 Wait.
 What?
 You...Sahastrara...
 sometimes it glows.
 OK...
 How do you know your cousin's
not talking a lot of bullshit?
 She said I can't
be part of this.
 Trust me. If I could switch
places with you...
 I would.
 - What's that smell?
- It's beeswax.
 Is that important,
the kind of candle it is?
 Well, the way it was explained to me
is that it's the sum of all the parts.
 You can bake a cake
without sugar,
 but it won't taste as sweet.
 - Now?
- Yeah.
 What?
 - Take it.
- Your hand?
 OK...
 Are we in business?
 What are you
doing with the cat?
 I know. You trusted me.
 What are you doing?
 You might want to turn around
 - for this.
- NO! What are you doing?!
 It's over.
 I think I'm gonna go outside
 - for a minute.
- OK, that's OK.
 Fucking cat.
 Hey! Hey, where are you going?
 Hey!
 If anybody sees you,
we're fucked!
 Don't tell me that.
 Don't...
 don't tell me that.
 Come, Nicolae.
 Help me, Nicolae!
 When I was a young man
such as yourself,
 our kind faced many dangers.
 I rode with an old woman,
 Magdalena.
 She could have been my grandmother
or great grandmother.
 No one knew for sure.
We rode from place to place...
 never settling.
 One day, we were
stopped by some men
 who wanted us to go
with them. Some of us
 ran and got away.
 I saw Magdalena was
not so lucky.
 Huh!
 I was a foolish little boy then.
 I thought I could protect her.
 The uniforms
were saying one thing...
 ...but the leader was upir.
 Bring me the woman!
 Tear the little beast's
throat out!
  I ran and ran.
 I promise you
I never looked back.
 In the end...
 I survived
 while many others did not.
 We run.
 It's what we do.
 Fuck you, Nicolae.
 I need something else.
 OK.
 Bacon.
 The grease, actually. I need you
to get me bacon grease.
 Is that how
you're gonna fight him?
 Yeah.
 Is there a price?
 My face.
 The price for breaking the rules
 is my human face.
 Did the brother of that guy Nicolae
killed really come after him?
 Your mom said
 he had to kill him too.
 It's a story.
 I believe it sometimes. Why?
 It's not important.
 Bacon grease.
 I'm gonna need a lot of it.
 All right.
 I believe
that's enough cholesterol
 to see you comfortably
 into your dotage.
 I'm feeling peachy, Mom.
Thanks for asking.
 It's quite obvious
you've made a complete recovery.
 - Where have you been?
- I was at the institute.
 I had a bit of a spell...
 but Dr. Pryce tells me
it's nothing to worry about.
 I'm really quite fine now.
 It's gonna end tonight.
Tonight, we're gonna kill it.
 Of course you are.
 Mm! Do turn the fan on, darling.
 The house will...
 stink of pig to high heaven.
 Tell Shelley I'm sorry,
but I won't be home for dinner.
 Before you go...
 if you may spare a moment
with your mother.
 Please.
 All right.
 Is this some kind of joke?
 Open it.
 Precious boy,
 you were born with the caul.
 I've always known
you were different. Better.
 Sometimes when I look
at people...
 ...I can make them do
whatever I say.
 I know.
 So much alike.
 Roman...
 what do you see?
 I see us.
 Now look closer.
 - What is this?
- I finally understand
 what you've been feeling
these last months.
 I tried to protect you like any
mother would protect their son.
 What is this?!
 What you must do
to continue your journey.
 This...
 is your kill.
 Try not to lose it, darling.
 It goes back a rather long way.
 We don't need words.
