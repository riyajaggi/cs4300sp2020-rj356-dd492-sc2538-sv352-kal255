 It was quite a night you had
 out in 433 Friday, Mr. Pullman.
 Can we take a moment
 for you to elaborate
on what you meant
 - when you said you'd been killed.
- What the fuck it usually mean?
 Heh. Well, you're sitting here
right now.
 They brought me back.
 How'd they pull that off?
 Cardio-cerebral resuscitation.
 Can you tell me about
 ouroboros?
 Where'd you hear that?
 Something you mentioned
 repeatedly.
Can you tell me
 its significance... to you?
 Where does the soul go?
 That's why they killed us.
 The plan. It's all
in their plan.
 But this... it's not right.
 It's not right that now we have
to see these things.
 I don't want to see.
 Nice one, jerks.
 You gave me a real scare there.
 She sure looks real.
 Baby, you sure look
a little pale.
 - Do you need... mouth to mouth?
- I'm having difficulty following,  - Frances.
- I see things.
 What do you see, Frances?
 You sure have pretty lips.
 Who else is gonna die?
 Good morning.
 Thank you.
 So, how was it?
 What?
 Something was out there.
 A scent.
 Of what? Milk-Bone?
 Something bad.
 Look,
 last night, you and my mom--
you're the only ones
 who know. I need you
to keep it that way.
 Who would I tell?
 Scout's honor.
 All right.
 I'm gonna go home and change.
Should I pick you up later?
 Hm. Poor thing.
 The turn, it really takes it
out of him.
 Coffee?
 School.
 Right.
 Roman, Scout's honor.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Sweet boy.
 This is one of the only rivers
 in the world that flows north.
 It confuses the birds.
 They say that birds can
 see the magnetic fields of the earth.
That's how they know where to migrate.
 What do you think it was
that brought us here?
 Is that blood?
 Yeah.
 Long story.
 Stupid-ass birds!
 Are you OK?
 We're in this together.
 Holy fuck!
 Tom.
 Norman.
 Thanks for meeting me.
 - Something on your mind?
- I got an odd call
 this morning from the state psychiatric
board inquiring about Pullman's condition.
 They were asking
jurisdictional questions about
 - his transfer to Hemlock Acres.
- And that's odd because...?
 You don't get that kind
of call without a push.
 The only folks around here
 with that kind of clout are
your friends at the White Tower.
 I don't have friends
at the Tower.
 Right.
 Look, I'm probably
over-thinking it, but...
 you know, you did me a hell of a favor,
and I thought you deserved a heads-up.
 I appreciate that.
 [Sheriff? Dispatch.
They've found another body.]
 God damn it.
 He wants you to be strong.
 Are you leaving?
 I want to make morning mass.
 Why do I do this to myself?
 All you know how to do is take.
 Jesus, Clementine. I can smell
it on your pores from here.
 This from an Irishman?
 As someone who likes to think of
himself as a surrogate father to you,
 I reserve the right
to get hennish.
 I think you know my attitude
towards father figures.
 I'm sorry for not returning
your calls.
 So you should be.
 Do you have any idea of the risk
of hypertension for men my age?
 You need some help getting up on that
cross, or did you bring a ladder?
 I hear Michael's in town.
 I heard the same thing.
 Just ask.
 - Have you seen him?
- He hasn't contacted me.
 The feeling is mutual.
 So there's nothing for me
to worry about?
 If there was something for you to worry
about, you'd know before either of us did.
 If that's a no,
that's good to hear.
 Good to hear.
 In other news.
 This one's going
 to be painful, even for you.
 [This is Car 2 responding to the wild
animal report at, uh, Hastings and 3rd.]
 [Officer Brady, see the woman,
325 Park Vista.]
 - [Potential prowler.]
- [Dispatch, this is]
 [Tilson. I'm entering the alley behind the
Feed and Grain. Possible animal sighting.]
 [We've got some scared people
downtown today.]
 You got something
 more pressing than the 10,000
calls still coming in?
 Sorry, Sheriff. I...
 I was on the patch but...
it's been a fucked-up month.
 That it has.
 Sheriff?
 I'm from Fish
and Wildlife Service.
 - You guys get badges?
- That's what the badge says.
 Dr. Chasseur.
 Sheriff Sworn.
 They said you were headed
our way.
 I wish it was for fishing season.
We're a little light
 on PhD's around here. Drunk and
disorderlies, domestics we can handle,
 but this is a little...
out of our jurisdiction.
 Happy to help.
I've seen it
 all before.
 Sorry to hear that.
 People in town are scared.
 They should be.
 And Lisa Willoughby was found in
more or less the same condition
 - as Brooke Bluebell.
- Emphasizing "less".
 Bite patterns indicate
it's the same animal,
 but the body's left out there
too long to tell what species.
 But, based on the condition
of Bluebell's car,
 - had to be a big one.
- No sign of the rest of her?
 What you see is what we found
at the scene.
 Given the lack of evidence
of violent struggle,
 the body's condition
of exsanguination... we are
 to believe that the animal
deposited her here?
 It seems that way.
 Yet leaving no trail to the
site of the actual killings.
 As with the Bluebell killing, no
tracks were discovered at the scene.
 Well, it's a good thing
I'm wearing sensible shoes.
 Hey. Hey, sweetheart.
It's OK.
 You can tell us.
We're your friends.
 Us freshmen, we...
we gotta stick together.
 Come on. What'd you eat first?
I mean, I know
 - what I'd eat first.
- See? It's not so bad.
 Who tasted better?
 Gotta be Brooke, right?
I mean, she was good to go.
 Did you do it fast or slow?
 Grunt once for "fast".
 Dude, now you're being a dick.
 But seriously, who's next?
 Class of '17, pinky swear,
we're cool. We won't say shit.
 Fuck.
 - Hey.
- Sorry. I don't know
 - what's wrong. She just started
crying and shit and... - Shh, shh, it's OK.
 We were trying to figure out
what's up, you know?
 Kiss him.
 What?
 Kiss his pretty little mouth.
 Oh!
 Get the fuck out of here!
 I can't believe
he did that!
 Everyone's scared shitless.
 Are you sure it wasn't you?
 I never go out on an empty
stomach. Also, fuck you.
 Well, maybe you don't remember
doing it. Maybe you blacked out.
 I mean, why else would you show me
the transformation?
 Maybe you want to get caught.
 Jesus.
 Here. Smoke this.
 It wasn't me.
 I know.
 - Vargulf.
- What?
 Vargulf.
 A wolf will only attack if it's
hungry or if it's provoked--
 if it's normal. A vargulf is
a wolf that's gone insane.
 Insane how?
 It doesn't eat what it kills.
 That's not the way.
It's like a disease.
 You sure that's what this is?
 How?
 I could smell it.
That night at the park.
 You can tell a whole life
by a scent--sex,
 health, fucking needs.
 This wasn't like anything.
This was just anger.
 Is it someone you know?
 I never knew any others
except Nicolae.
 But this is a strange town.
You can feel it on your balls.
 So, I guess we find him now.
 Who?
 The... the vargulf.
 Why?
 To make him stop.
 Have you heard
of the Order of the Dragon?
 It was a group of knights
from the Crusades.
 My mom used to tell stories.
 I've always wanted
to be a warrior.
 I see things sometimes.
 I hear these whispers,
but I don't always know
 if they're real or not.
I need to do something.
 I know.
 What are you talking about?
You just told me--
 Roman, maybe this is something you should
be discussing with your guidance counselor.
 The fuck is that supposed
to mean?!
 It means no! I know it's not
a word you're used to hearing,
 - but no. I'm sorry.
- Sorry?! Hey!
 The girl who found
the body, Christina,
 best friends with my daughters.
 It's really messing her up.
 Weird.
 Can we, uh...
be of any assistance?
 There are no tracks...
 aside from what I take are
your tracking dogs.
 Soft pads...
 ...clipped nails.
 Isn't that what we said?
 No, you said none were found.
 A real tracker can trace a man's steps
through a city from a helicopter.
 I can tell you a girl under
a hundred pounds came
 from that direction
at a relaxed pace,
 ran off
 in a state of distress.
 This print was made by a Caucasian
male, approximately 200 pounds;
 at some point suffered an injury
to his left knee.
 - How do you know Caucasian?
- It's Pennsylvania.
 What I can't tell you is
 what kind of animal left
Lisa Willoughby here
 or what direction it came from.
 Of course, there's been nearly a week
for the tracks to degrade, but...
 we're still talking about
an animal of sufficient size
 to drag a 60-pound load
an unknown distance.
 And that...
 officers...
 is very weird.
 In your experience, why would
an animal do that?
 In my experience, it wouldn't.
 Kind of goes against the grain
of being a predator.
 My cat drags creatures home
all the time.
 It's not your turn to talk when
you're not holding the retard stick.
 He's right.
 The only logical motive for it
 to be left here is if it was
meant to be discovered.
 A trophy.
 I'm sorry... what kind
of animal has a motive?
 It's necessary for a predator to anticipate
the evasions of its prey in advance,
 requiring a basic theory
of mind.
 So...
 ...one that's capable
of empathy.
 Hey.
 Hey, you home?
 - [No, I'm at the, uh, OBG.]
- The what?
 The gynecologist.
 No jokes. Baby date.
 You there?
 Yeah.
 [What's wrong?]
 I just, um...
 - Letha Godfrey?
- OK. They're playing my song. I gotta go.
 'K.
 We're ready for you.
 - And how are you today?
- I'm good, thank you. How are you?
 Do you want to get lunch
at the club?
 Are you sure you have time?
 Yeah.
 She has irises.
 And yes, I know
I'm being a feminist
 in calling her "she".
 I wonder what color
her eyes are.
 I think I need some air.
 Got a happy hour?
 Just missed it.
 - My luck.
- ID?
 Can do.
 Whiskey, please.
Straight.
 Coming up.
 Sheeit.
 Hey. Can you do me a favor?
Come down to the bar.
 Yeah, he's here.
 OK.
 - I can't believe we're doing this.
- I... this is... Yeah, well,
 hey, this is what you wanted to do, so--
Yeah, it's what you wanted to do. Yeah.
 - So let's try something new.
- No, we're gonna do it, yeah.
 - And open, OK? Let's just be open.
- All right, this is just not...
 I first made my vows
to the goddess 6,000 years ago.
 And over various lifetimes
 and incarnations...
I have served her
 as priestess, sorceress,
and healer.
 I've bathed in the flames
of Ishtar and Babylon
 and danced for Diana in Corinth.
 My name is Destiny... and...
 I will be your sacred whore.
 It's OK to laugh.
 Laughter makes us like children.
Also, feel free to look around.
 I'm assuming this is
your first time.
 Yeah, you could say that.
 Good. I love when couples are
openhearted enough to come to me.
 Or, as is often the case,
the woman lost a bet.
 - No, actually.
- Nope.
 Well, either way, I bring them
grace, healing,
 compassion, caring,
communication,
 and intimacy.
 But, before we get
to the fun stuff, I have to ask
 one question.
This is a pure process
 which involves channeling
mysterious and powerful forces
 that put me in personal danger.
 Are you on or near your moon?
 No. No.
 Oh. No. Nope.
 Good.
 Jesus Christ!
 Oh, my god!
 Oh, my god! Oh, shit!
 W-We-- We're so sorry. Here,
it's everything I got.
 - Just take it, take it.
- Leave and never come back!
 Hey, sweetie. Let me just get
cleaned up.
 Yes. Suckers.
 It's not your problem.
 The vargulf is dangerous
but short-lived.
 It's like...
any other disease.
 It only gets stronger
until it consumes you.
 So he's gonna kill again.
 Mm-hmm. He won't stop...
 until he destroys himself,
 which really in the end is
what he wants the most.
 This isn't mild-mannered
Bruce Banner.
 This is Norman Bates. Just...
 stay out of the way
and let nature take its course.
 But... I mean,
theoretically...
 there's no way to help him
even if we knew who it was?
 Have you been sniffing
rubber cement?
 Why are you talking like this?
 I'm just saying,
if we knew who it was.
 Well, then yeah. I'd put a bullet
between his eyes before the next turn.
 Hm.
 Hm.
 What are you not telling me?
 There's this upir.
 What?
 He's this kid at my school,
but I'm pretty sure
 - he doesn't even know it.
- You've asked him?
 Jesus Christ!
No, I haven't
 asked him.
But he's confused.
 I would know if he was
bullshitting me.
 I don't know, he's...
 trying to be the good guy
or something.
 What the fuck are you
and an upir having
 a heart-to-heart about good guys
and bad guys for?
 Do you think I'm just blood
capsules and parlor tricks?
 Hey! You're my cousin
and I love you,
 but do not make me go in there.
 He knows.
 How much does he know?
 He was there for the last turn.
 What the fuck, Peter?!
 The one thing that you don't ever, ever
tell anyone with your feet on hot coals
 - you only let an upir watch?!
- You were not there.
 I certainly wasn't.
 There's this thing.
 I don't know.
 We have the same dreams.
 I had a dream about that
the other night.
 Oh, my god.
 What?
 Oh.
 Sweetie.
 You've never had
a real friend before.
 Look...
 Run.
 Run
 before it's too late for you.
 Two girls brutally mauled
and killed. Now Hemlock Grove
 police are asking the public to
report any unusual activity...
 Good-looking girls.
 Fuckin' tragic.
 ...the latest details
and breaking news at 10...
 What a world, huh?
 What a world.
 You know what? Um...
 I have a great idea for you.
 Why don't you move over there?
 There's a kids' section,
so, you know... nice spot.
 I'm good.
 Well,
 you're too close.
 And I appreciate you moving.
 Whatever he's having, on me.
 In fact, another round
for the house.
 No.
 Nobody needs
your fucking money.
 My brother lost his house
because of your father.
 Oh.
 Have him call me.
I have extras.
 Why don't you tell your brother
to be
 a fuckin' man, huh?
 Do it.
 Hit him.
 Come on, darling.
 Do you remember the story
I used to tell you
 of the Emperor Moth?
 Just a little thing.
 A naturalist once came upon the
cocoon of this rare creature,
 just as it was struggling
to emerge in its new form.
 He watched as it writhed and labored
terribly to shed its shell.
 And then the neck
of the cocoon split. It seemed
 to gain no progress.
 Unable
 to witness such a thing
of beauty suffer so...
 the man produced a blade
and cut it free.
 He cradled the new moth, waiting
for it to spread its fine wings.
 But the wings were undersized.
 Its colors dull and ordinary.
 Spared the struggle
that would have developed them,
 The moth could now only crawl
on thin legs...
 and soon died.
 Hate me if you must,
 but you are an emperor.
 Hey there.
 - Hi, Tom.
- Chrissy,
 there's somebody I want you to meet.
This is Dr. Chasseur
 and she's here to help out
the department for a bit.
 About the dead girl.
 What are you a doctor of?
 Predatorothology.
 So you're like Hannibal Lecter
but for animals?
 Yeah, I suppose you could
think of it that way.
 Is it weird that this is
your job when you're a girl?
 I mean, I don't mean
to be a jerk or anything,
 but... well, I'm a novelist, so it's
important to me to understand people's
 - motivations.
- Of course. And to answer your question,
 yes. And when I was a kid, I was more interested
in my brother's dinosaurs than Barbies.
 I knew the bite pressure
 of a great white shark,
 the vertical leap
of a Bengal tiger.
 It just seemed way more important
to me than girl stuff, you know?
 A lot of girl stuff seems...
frivolous to me.
 Do you believe
 in evolution?
 Oh. You certainly
 are observant.
 Uh, yes.
 Personally, if I took the
trouble of creating the world,
 I wouldn't make a condition of believing
in me not believing in dinosaurs.
 But aren't faith and science
basically irreconcilable?
 Yeah...
 it can sure feel that way
sometimes.
 Well, aren't I lucky to be talking
to the next great American novelist?
 Hm? You know, 'cause the reason
I wanted to speak with you
 is to see if those powers
of observation noticed any...
 evidence
 of the animal that did this.
 I'm sorry if this is upsetting
 to you, but you are the only
person who encountered the area
 in an uncorrupted condition.
 So... do you remember seeing
any paw prints?
 - Any dragging marks in the leaves?
- No.
 He didn't... leave anything
like that.
 He?
 Hm.
 - Waste not, want not.
- Hurry up!
 - We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, yeah!
 Gotta run.
 Shit.
 You know the drill.
 Short and sweet, OK?
 Peter Rumancek?
 Yes?
 I'm sorry to bother. We won't
take up much of your time.
 Just have a few questions,
if it's not imposing.
 Yes, sir.
 I'd shake your hand,
but they seem to be occupied.
 Hm. Very hirsute young man, aren't you?
 Well, you'd have to tell me
what "hirsute" means, ma'am.
 It means, and forgive me
for saying, but, uh, furry.
 Oh! Guilty, ma'am.
 Peter, I'm Dr. Chasseur.
 I'm a special agent with the US
Fish and Wildlife Service.
 I didn't realize
I was that hairy, ma'am.
 No. No, no, no.
 I just, uh, well...
 Hello.
 Hey.
 You moving in or out?
 Around, I suppose.
 Bit of a rambler myself. Can you
guess what brought me here?
 - Do you want me to, ma'am?
- Heh.
 I'm here about
the animal attacks. Yes. OK?
 - Any theories yourself on that score?
- No, ma'am.
 - But I've heard some pretty good ones.
- Bet you have.
 I don't suppose you are
by any chance a werewolf, Peter?
 I beg your pardon?
 When the moon is full, do you
walk in the skin of a wolf?
 No, sir.
 Ma'am. No, ma'am.
 Good.
Well, now that's settled.
 Can I possibly
ask why, ma'am--
 Do you know
Christina Wendell?
 Yes, sir.
 You know she was the one
who discovered Lisa Willoughby?
 - Yes, ma'am.
- Can you think of any reason she might have
 to think you were a werewolf,
Peter?
 Well,
 because I told her, ma'am.
 Any particular reason
you told her?
 Because she asked me.
 Any particular reason
she asked?
 My middle and index finger are
the same length.
 This is an attribute
of werewolfism?
 Well, she seemed to think so,
ma'am,
 but I'm really not
an expert on the whole thing.
 So you continue to deny
all werewolf allegations.
 Yes, ma'am. There's
no such thing, ma'am.
 Hm. Do you really
believe that, Peter?
 I thought it was
a scientific fact, ma'am.
 Proving a negative is misuse of
both the term "science" and "fact",
 But I thought it was just this
close to scientific fact, ma'am.
 Are you aware of the term
"clinical lycanthropy"?
 No, ma'am.
 It's a condition.
It causes a subject to believe
 that he or she is a werewolf
and then act accordingly.
 Well, it takes all kinds
to make a world, ma'am.
 Did you know either Lisa
Willoughby or Brooke Bluebell?
 No, ma'am.
 What were you and Roman
Godfrey doing in Kilderry Park,
 at night, just after
the Bluebell killing?
 We were catching
fireflies, ma'am.
 Does Roman Godfrey think
he's a werewolf?
 I don't have his power
of attorney.
 - Hazard a guess.
- I would guess not.
 - Cat person?
- All creatures great or small,
 ma'am.
 Well, thank you
 for being so open with us,
Peter. Very polite young man.
 Silly questions, I know,
 but hope we get
to speak again soon.
 Well, you know where
to find us.
 What are you gonna do?
 We can't leave.
 Gypsy racist
 bullshit. Here you go.
 â™ª Drive on, drive on â™ª
 â™ª My special one â™ª
 â™ª Don't you stop till you know
you're gone â™ª
 â™ª Your sister and me have
a set of keys â™ª
 â™ª Don't you worry your head
about a thing â™ª
 â™ª Drive on, drive on â™ª
 â™ª My special one â™ª
 â™ª Don't you stop till you know
you're gone â™ª
 â™ª Drive on, drive on â™ª
 â™ª My special one â™ª
 â™ª Don't you stop till you know
you're gone â™ª
 â™ª Your sister and me will
keep your place clean â™ª
 â™ª So it shines when you finally
come home â™ª
 â™ª Drive on, drive on â™ª
 â™ª My special one â™ª
 â™ª Don't you stop till you know
you're gone â™ª
 Yes?
 Is Roman here?
 Oh, may I ask who's calling?
 It's Peter.
 Hmm. He's never
mentioned you.
 We share the same
English class.
 And this is in regard to...?
 Study group.
 Oh.
 Wuthering Heights,
 is it?
 gypsy
 Byronic hero
 or proto-Marxist
class warrior?
 I'm still on chapter one.
 Yes. I suppose you are.
 It doesn't end well for him.
 Well, I'm afraid Roman isn't
home at the moment, so I will
 tell him you stopped by.
Uh, Paul, was it?
 It's Peter.
 Yeah, well,
nice to meet you, Peter.
 You have a caller.
 Yeah?
 We need to talk.
 Yeah, well, maybe this is
something you should be
 discussing with your guidance
counselor, huh?
 Maybe I will.
 What's the big deal?
 The Wendell girl totally flipped out. They
aren't going to be taking it seriously.
 It's not that simple.
All right,
 this woman is what she says she is
like a Mexican hates fireworks.
 What is she?
 She's a digger.
 The only people who really know
what you are are your mom and me.
 And I know how to button up!
 - That's not why I'm here.
- So what are you afraid she digs up?
 Nicolae.
 - He's still alive?
- No,
 but if she goes deep enough,
she's gonna find out.
 What?
 Nicolae was a killer.
 He killed one of our own.
 That's where this comes from.
It stands for "Garjo".
 "Outsider." Nicolae stood outside
of all worlds and I stand
 - next to Nicolae.
- So what?
 It's in my blood.
 Blood stains.
 What, she's gonna dig up a body
5,000 miles and 70 years away?
 She doesn't need to.
All she needs is a scent.
 My people have gone away for
a lot of years for a lot less.
 Who do you think
this Chasseur really is?
 It doesn't matter. All that matters
is not putting me in a cage.
 It's too late
for me to run now.
 So, what, then?
 We do what you said.
 We find the vargulf
and we stop him.
 - How?
- If there's time
 before the next moon, help him. It's possible
he doesn't even know what he's doing.
 If there's not?
 I kill him.
 You would do that?
 I would do what was necessary.
 Where would we start?
 Lisa Willoughby.
 Seems like a bit
of a dead end, don't you think?
 Well, what's left of her. We find
out where they're burying here.
 - Why?
- Because...we're gonna dig her up.
 We're gonna dig her up.
 You wanted
to see me, Mr. Pullman?
 Another one, another one.
I don't want to see any more.
 Frances.
 Dad.
 Sorry.
 I didn't mean to wake you up.
 It's fine.
 You all right?
 No.
 Why don't you come over here?
 Come on.
 You don't have
to worry about me.
 I'm gonna stay safe.
 I seen it.
 What... what did you see,
Frances?
 I seen the thing inside her.
 What do you mean?
The thing inside who?
 The thing
inside your little girl.
