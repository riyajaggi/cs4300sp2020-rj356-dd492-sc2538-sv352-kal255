 (loud thunderclaps)
 (tires screeching)
 This is crazy, JR!
 I know what you're thinking,
but Shelley deserves a chance.
 - What condition's the body in?
- Her name is Shelley. Shelley!
 ♪♪♪
 There's a rumor going around
that you're a werewolf.
 Well, are you?
 What do you think?
 Take two. What are you doing
with my cousin Roman?
 What needs to be done.
 You do know we're
in high school
 and not a Clint Eastwood movie.
 You ever seen High Plains Drifter?
 I'm just glad the two of you
are getting along.
 Roman doesn't
have many friends.
 Excuse me.
 You that sure
I'm not contagious? Ooh.
 (laughing)
 Just promise me you'll keep
him from doing something stupid.
 Since when did I become
the designated driver?
 Please.
 All right, shit, fine.
 I promise.
 Now that we're talking turkey
though, what can you tell me
 - about Roman's mom?
- Aunt Olivia?
 - Why?
- References.
 - In case she asks for a loan.
- Yeah, I'll bet. Hmm.
 Well, as the story goes,
Roman's dad was touring
 biomedical facilities in England
when he first met Olivia.
 Further reports indicate
 that he was bedazzled
right from the start.
 Whoa. Bedazzled? People
actually use that world?
 Some people do.
 What else? On the day that
they buried her husband,
 the local paper described
my aunt as the most beautiful
 and despised woman
 in Hemlock Grove.
 Hmm. And they say
journalism is dead.
 Prize?
 That's creepy.
 It actually means good luck.
 Come on. Don't be
such a fucking girl!
 Dr. Chasseur.
 Dr. Pryce.
 Thank you for seeing me.
I know you must be very busy.
 I saw the preparations
downstairs. You're celebrating
 - the institute's 20th anniversary?
- Yes, tomorrow's festivities.
 An ode to our late founder,
 orchestrated by Mrs. Godfrey
and her son.
 Intrigued?
 Artificial, isn't it?
 One of your creations?
 Mmm, and a puzzle.
 Every test indicates
 the scent is genetically
identical to the real flower.
 Still, the bees have
yet to be convinced.
 Ever consider
planting a garden?
 It's not, as they say,
in my job description.
 You're not planning on recording
our conversation, are you, Doctor?
 Hadn't planned on it, no.
 I am. (beeping)
Just so you know.
 And, please, call me Johann.
 So what is it exactly
that you do here, Johann?
 Sly devil, pretending
you don't know.
 I admit I did some reading.
 Your area of specialization
is quite contentious.
 I was hoping I could convince you to amplify
on the premise of your first published paper.
 The one colloquially
referred to
 as "better reincarnation
through chemistry?"
 - Mm-hmm.
- It's all theoretical.
 If one took
an existing but inanimate
 - carbon-based structure--
- A corpse.
 That was still
in a relatively labile situation.
 A baby's corpse.
 One might weave into the existing
structure the element of phosphorous,
 forming chain molecules
that could support life...
 ...all of which raises
one overriding question:
 How is this of any importance
 to the US Fish
and Wildlife Service?
 Johann, is there any chance any of your
test animals could have gotten out,
 any of your human subjects?
 (panting)
 None whatsoever.
 And there I thought
I'd cracked the case.
 You wouldn't happen to have any
thoughts on our demon dog, would you?
 There is one thing, Doctor.
 Considering the parallels
between the two killings,
 I'm convinced this was
the premeditated act
 of a pathological
sexual predator.
 Didn't you say you believed
an animal was responsible?
 Yes, I did.
 Because no person could do what was
done to those bodies, not barehanded.
 Owing to an abnormality
with my adrenal glands,
 I suffer from what is
clinically described
 as hysterical strength.
 The type of physical feats induced
by fight-or-flight mode are...
 simply my mode.
 You do know that technically
 this makes you a suspect.
 - Dr. Chasseur.
- Clementine.
 Clementine, then.
 You should know the Godfreys are very
protective of the institute's fortunes.
 - And?
- Tread lightly and with certainty.
 It's been my experience that the
bees don't land on them either.
 (cell phone ringing)
 Yes?
 (chuckling)
 Nothing more to say
to your old friend?
 What an unexpected surprise.
 [As surprises should be.]
 I'm calling because,
all assurances to the contrary,
 I'm hearing that
you're still drinking.
 And if I said it wasn't true?
 Then I'd believe you...
 until I had reason
to think otherwise.
 Well, then you have
your answer.
 Anything else?
 Just that you've always been
 my favorite, Clementine.
 Get your damn hands off me!
Son of a bitch!
 - Get the goddamn door!
- Fuck you, man!
 Fuck you!
 Piece of shit!
 I'll bite it off at the knuckle.
 Look at us, a couple wily
desperados thrown together by fate.
 Fucking mentira.
 INS men picked me up
two days ago for no reason.
 - Right.
- I have a green card,
 I'm legal, I swear,
but no one will listen.
 I can't have my baby here.
 Go ahead, honey.
Cry if it makes you happy.
 God does not want us
to be happy.
 He wants us to be strong.
 Sacred heart of Jesus,
please pray for me.
 St. Jude, helper of the
hopeless, please pray for me.
 St. Jude, worker of miracles,
please pray for me.
 Please pray for me.
Please pray for me.
 Pray for me.
 I heard about what happened
to you in the woods.
 I'm sorry.
 Why would you be sorry?
 Because I am.
 Are you done?
 I guess so.
 You won't get away
with it, you know?
 (sobbing)
 Roman.
 We have a guest.
 Uh, Shelley darling,
would you go up to your room?
 What's the problem?
 Franklin Hernandez.
 Go on, officer.
 It appears some deviants - and by some I
mean two, given the footprints we found -
 got down and dirty at
the cemetery last night.
 - Some kind of prank?
- If you consider digging up
 Lisa Willoughby's corpse and gutting her like
a fish a prank, yes, I guess it was a prank.
 So who's Hernandez?
Is he a suspect or...?
 He is our gardener.
 Who's been in the hospital
for the last three weeks.
 We retrieved this
from the hole.
 Any idea how a shovel from your
property wound up near an open grave?
 Roman?
 Maybe somebody stole it.
 Stole your gardener's shovel?
 This shovel?
 Yeah.
 Well, in case you're interested,
there is a $10,000 reward.
 Which I've just
offered to double.
 Yeah. Like I said,
you know...
 OK.
 Thank you for your help,
Mrs. Godfrey.
 - My pleasure.
- I'll be seeing you, kid.
 You did this.
 You and that gypsy scum,
choosing a moment
 - you knew would hurt me most.
- What?
 Tomorrow's gala for your father.
Don't pretend you've forgotten.
 - Jesus.
- Do you hate me so much
 that you would risk this
family's public humiliation?
 What if I told you that
what I'm doing is important?
 That it is quite possibly
the most important--
 Be quiet.
 I can't bear the sound of you.
 Another visit from the police and
I will collect the reward myself.
 Nod if you understand.
 Tomorrow, guests
arrive at eight.
 You will be prompt,
properly dressed
 and attentive
to our guests. Nod!
 Now stay out of my sight.
 So, did you and my cousin
have a pleasant lunch?
 Huh?
 Nutrition! They don't
call it lunch anymore.
 Roman! Hey!
 She pities me.
 Yeah, she's all heart.
 You never told me
why you're here.
 Why don't you talk to me?
 So you're in the military.
 It means you have people,
 someone who cares about you.
 There's a brother, Michael,
 a Marine like me,
 another 10 out of 10
on the "fucked up" scale.
 Shit!
 Why are you doing that?
 I'm not here on some bullshit
drunk and disorderly.
 Rednecks are gonna
bury my black ass
 just as surely as
they're gonna let you rot.
 It's a weapon.
 Not yet.
 Take me with you when you go.
 Please. I'll do
anything you ask.
 I just can't have my baby here.
 Ride my coattails?
 Work the edge.
Not the point.
 Not the point.
 Thank you, Chasseur.
 Clementine.
 Thank you, Clementine.
 (knocking)
 Peter! Hi. Muah.
 Come in. I'll just be a second.
 Now, I want you to find time
every day to be mindful
 of the love and nourishment
flowing from your Manipura, OK?
 And lay off the refined sugars.
 - It messes with your metabolism.
- All right, thank you.
 - Another happy customer?
- Crushed a couple blue pills in his tea.
 The sugar thing was
just common sense.
 Like when your doctor
tells you to stop smoking.
 One size fits all.
 Hi!
(kissing sounds)
 This is my cousin,
Destiny Rumancek.
 I'm Roman.
 See anything interesting?
 Hmm.
 You gentlemen have
something for me?
 Ooh! Orangies.
 What a sweetie.
 Just tell me why
this is better than running.
 Fucked if I can, D.
 Oh, Peter.
 Mmm.
 Wah!
 Hello, handsome.
 - Sorry, buddy. Bon appétit. - How long is this gonna take?
 Better let it sit overnight
for good measure.
 We'll need some tequila.
 - Is that part of it?
- No.
 Um, something in a pretty
bottle. Silver's good.
 You got it.
 (rap music)
 (He turns the volume down.)
 Why didn't she tell me
what she saw in my palm?
 'Cause it doesn't
work like that.
 Oh, I didn't realize I had to grease your
whore cousin like the rest of the rubes.
 Whore as in, like, literal description.
I'm a fucking feminist.
 What you want isn't for sale. Destiny
doesn't trade real magic for money.
 She trades everything else.
 It's not the same.
 (He turns the volume up.)
 Women do what they do.
 That's the hell of it.
 (He turns down the volume.)
What?
 Women do what they do.
 That's the hell of it.
 Shee-it.
 I think my Manipura
needs nourishment.
 (laughing)
 That's ridiculous.
 (laughing)
 Ah, Francis.
Good morning.
 Good morning my ass.
 You got me all fucked up.
 It's just a sedative.
I'm told you had a bad night.
 I don't want anyone else
 helping me sleep.
 Right.
 Can you tell me anything
more about Ouroboros,
 anything that may help us?
 That's why they killed us.
 Us.
 Do you mean there were others?
 (chuckling)
 You don't want to do this.
 You don't want to see.
 Francis,
 I need you to focus.
 You know, Ouroboros,
this talk of the dragon.
 I can't help you unless
I know what you mean.
 Why don't you ask that beady-
eyed little fucker Pryce?
 So, where's your extremely
tall upir friend?
 He's going to a party
but he, uh,
 he expects a full report.
 So Inspector Rumancek
 - is still on the case?
- Shut up.
 Peter, this goes wrong,
 Roman goes home to his mom.
You could end up in a cage.
 OK.
 This can be messy.
 Ooh.
 Hello.
 Ooh.
 Now.
 OK, whatever you need, ask it
quick because this goes fast.
 OK.
 Hey, I don't suppose
you're ticklish, huh?
 Try it and it'll be
the last thing you ever do.
 - Good?
- Mm-hmm.
 (grunting)
 Can you talk?
 - Yes.
- What can you tell me?
 I hated butterscotch,
was good at shit, liked to sew,
 was planning on giving Scott
Buford a blowjob for his birthday
 but would have chickened out.
 Sorry. What can you tell me
about your death?
 I came to Hemlock Grove
because of the invitation.
 It was dark. There was no one else there.
I thought that was a part of it and--
 - Wait. What invitation?
- Fun, fun, fun.
 I parked,
 got out, but left my keys
in the car. Ding,
 ding, ding.
 I was alone, I thought,
 but then he was there,
 all big and all black - ding,
 ding, ding, ding.
 (gasping)
 I've always had a way with dogs.
 I reached out to pet his cheek
 and then I saw his eyes,
a horrible yellow.
 - Oh, God. It was how he looked at me.
- Looked how?
 The helpless way a dog looks at you
when he can't tell you what it needs.
 (grunting)
 I need to brush my teeth.
 This continues the personal
journal of Dr. Johann Pryce.
 Full stop.
 I met a Dr. Chasseur. Full stop.
 She affects an enigmatic
manner - semicolon.
 The forest ranger coat, comma,
 her guileless manner, comma,
 all carefully designed to put
her subjects at ease. Full stop.
 So close, comma,
 and yet sadly oblivious
to what awaits her
 should her inquiries
lead to the Godfreys' door.
 Full stop.
 (buzzing)
 Hello, Norman.
 - A bit early for this evening's soiree.
- Shut up.
 Tell me about
Ouroboros, Johann.
 I see.
 Can I get you something? Brandy?
 - Red Bull?
- Don't.
 Yes, Ouroboros.
 Of course. One of
our spaghetti projects.
 - The hell's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, it's a term
 one of the wags in the
laboratory devised to define
 our more conceptual efforts,
 as in we throw something
against the wall
 and see if it sticks. In the
case of Ouroboros, pit vipers.
 They possess heat-sensitive
organs called thermoreceptors.
 We were studying them to see if
there might be a human application.
 For instance, to aid the blind.
 Why would the homeless man under my
care be raving about pit vipers?
 Oh, this wouldn't be
our Francis Pullman.
 Well, yes, he was a volunteer
for one of our drug trials.
 Unfortunately, this particular
sedative discovered
 could cause mild
hallucinogenic effects.
 In spaghetti terms,
it did not stick.
 None of that explains why
both Pullman and my niece
 reference something
they call the dragon.
 Well, if you like,
I could show you.
 We're just past
clinical microbiology.
 The sleep lab is that way.
Sometimes I take Shelley there
 to monitor her REM activity
 and this.
 Sometimes the most
obvious explanation
 is the most
obvious explanation.
 A clever thief learns
to cover his tracks.
 You seem to be under
a great deal of stress.
 If you worked for me,
I'd insist you take a vacation.
 But you work for me, Pryce.
 Which reminds me. You should be receiving
an offer soon from a firm called Lod LLC.
 (laughing)
 - I'm getting an offer?
- To buy you out.
 You've made it abundantly clear you'd
just as soon disavow the whole institute.
 Consider it your chance to
relieve yourself of your burden.
 My burden, Johann, or yours?
 You'd have rather she had died?
 Shelley did die.
 Your brother understood
the ramifications.
 He was a father mourning the death of
his child, and you exploited that.
 Would you care to tell our
girl that you see her conception
 as the result of
emotional incompetence?
 It's the only damn thing
about her that's normal.
 Now you understand something.
I have a teenage daughter
 I'm taking to the OB/GYN tomorrow and
I'm telling you - don't interrupt!
 And I'm telling you now,
if I find evidence
 that you had any involvement
in her condition,
 I'll have you killed.
 Well.
 Hmm. Now,
 be a good fellow and tell
your friends at Lod
 to righteously and rigorously
 go fuck themselves.
 Of course, comma,
if he had learned anything
 during his years within
the gulag of academia,
 it was that rational decisions
based upon the premise
 that other human beings
were rational agents were,
 comma, in fact, comma,
 a fucking lie.
 Next time maybe
lay off on the tequila.
 You better be careful
around this Roman
 and his mother.
 The little prince has no teeth
 and the queen's an actress.
 She's just bored.
 I saw a conversion
 of his fate line and heart line.
 Your friend is gonna face
the hardest choice
 of his life, and whoever's
in his shadow
 is gonna share in
the consequences.
 And bored is just one mask.
Who knows how many more
 that crazy bitch is
wearing underneath?
 Spic and span.
 I better get going -
 - school night and all.
- Peter,
 you remember why Nicolae
was so afraid of the upir?
 Never forget what he is, Peter,
 especially if he has.
 What can you tell me
about angels?
 Angels are messengers that
help us better understand God.
 Why are you asking me
about angels?
 There's this girl at my school.
 What is it with you
and crazy girls?
 A moment for an old friend?
 (laughing)
 I understand that you have
 a certain confidence
with your Uncle Norman.
 I'm not cross with you.
I'm not Olivia.
 But there is something I have
to do, something very important
 and, by necessity, secret.
 Now, I know that
sounds unseemly,
 but I ask, have you
ever shown your mother
 your poetry?
Exactly.
 There's no shame
in hiding some things.
 You've done nothing wrong,
glowworm,
 but I have to ask you
to repeat nothing
 I tell you.
 Ouroboros is that important
 and that vulnerable.
 I am, as always,
in my best girl's debt,
 and even more deeply
 if you would favor me
with a smile.
 Thank you, glowworm.
 We should hurry. You promised
we'd be out by tonight.
 What are you gonna name it?
 Diego,
 if it's a boy.
 If it's a girl, Leticia,
 after my mother.
 Thank you.
 God wants you to be strong, OK?
 It's time.
 Please, someone help!
 Chasseur, she's not breathing!
Someone help!
 (cracking sound)
 (moaning)
 (ripping sound, screaming)
 (screaming in pain)
 (low growling)
 (Growling intensifies.)
 (roaring)
 It's better this way.
 For both of you.
 You were wise to kill it
before it fully transformed.
 (whistling)
 Exemplary work, Dr. Chasseur.
The bishop will be pleased.
 Three fucking weeks
you left me in there with it,
 knowing she'd turn.
 You needed to smell it.
 She was pregnant.
 Welcome to the Order
of the Dragon, Dr. Chasseur.
 Geez, it stinks in here.
 Darlings.
 Oh, Letha.
 Such a beautiful boy.
 Look at that
cocky little prick.
 - Jesus, Dale, what now?
- I'm here and JR's not,
 leaving that freak
and his whore mother
 as the once and future king
of the Godfrey Institute.
 Lord help us all.
 - Two waters, please.
- Uh, one with peppermint, please.
 My stomach.
 Thanks.
 Are you all right?
 You always knew how
to find the right spot.
 I don't know if you've
given it any thought,
 but you should have your baby
here, at the institute.
 Cola product, please.
 I didn't think they handled
that sort of thing here.
 I hear they're opening
an obstetrics unit.
 They have the best doctors
in the world. Even better,
 you'd be close to home. Yeah?
 Whatever's best.
 Oh, God.
 Get your hands off her.
Are you OK?
 - What happened?
- Give me your jacket.
 What's wrong?
 Give me your jacket.
Come on. I'm taking you home.
 What about Roman?
 Listen to me, little girl.
If you want to have this baby,
 you need to start acting
like a pregnant woman,
 not some starry-eyed
party favor.
 Stay. I'll drive her.
 As soon as this fiasco's over,
then I'll be home.
 Bourbon, please, straight.
 Another one.
 Twelve goddamn years.
 What?
 Since that bitch
drove your brother to it.
 You're fucking drunk, Dale.
 At least the rug rat's
finally off the teat,
 though I doubt
he'd have the fortitude
 to pull his own pecker,
let alone run a business.
 Go home. Sleep it off.
 Thank you, sir.
 Well, piss on her!
 Piss on her,
 and piss on her useless brat!
 Hmph!
 What?
 Ladies and gentlemen.
 It's been 20 years
since last we gathered.
 Then, it was to celebrate the
inauguration of the Godfrey Institute,
 the long-held dream
 of my late husband,
 JR Godfrey.
 Now we're getting somewhere.
 Now all these years later, we gather
once more to celebrate this good man,
 JR,
 businessman,
 friend,
 husband and father.
 JR's greatest passion
was his family.
 His death was a terrible tragedy
felt deeply
 - by all who knew him. (laughing)
- Oh, honey.
 But none more
than our son, Roman.
 - Right on fucking cue.
- Oh, for Christ's sakes.
 Come on, take a bow, Liv.
That's a hell of a performance.
 - That's enough.
- Open your eyes, Godfrey.
 If anyone killed
your brother, it was her.
 - I got this.
- Oh, get off of me.
 - I'm leaving. I'm leaving.
- Let's go.
 Where's my fucking wife?!
 My husband's death
affected us all
 in different ways.
After the shock passed,
 I chose to focus my attentions
on the institute,
 comforted knowing that
my husband's healing legacy
 would continue,
 first through me,
 and then our son.
 What is that?
 Oh, my god. Roman?
 Roman?
 Please tell Theo
 that the institute
will be in good hands.
