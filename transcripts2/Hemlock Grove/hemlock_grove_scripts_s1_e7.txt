 Juliette's body
isn't even cold.
 Look at her.
 There are
as many ways to grieve
 as there are people
in the world.
 You're really gonna
feed me that gem?
 You don't even
believe that, Norman.
 Suggest a doctor.
 I already have.
 No, no, no, no, no,
 - you can't be serious.
- I am. It's only the best
 - for my family.
- Well, the best for your family
 isn't family, trust me.
 Look, I can give you the name
of half a dozen therapists
 much more qualified
than I am in this field.
 She won't talk to anyone.
 Well, what makes you
think she'll talk to me?
 And what are they doing next?
 Patients on their first visit?
 Why are you so concerned
about what's typical here?
 We're both participating
in this charade for him.
 I just...
want to understand my role.
 Why do you think you're here?
 - I told you.
- Tell me again.
 Because some of us
at times must be mothers
 to more than just children.
 JR implied you're afraid
to be alone with me.
 Tell me... did he always need
 so much reassurance?
 Is that what it means
to be a mother to you?
 I was...
 raised by my father...
 and his threshold for nonsense
was nonexistent.
 That doesn't answer
the question of your feelings
 about motherhood.
 Would it pique
your interest more
 if I told you my father
was a severe disciplinarian?
 I'm asking you about your
personal experience of being
 - a mother.
- Why?
 Because your daughter
just died.
 There's a gallon of milk
 in the refrigerator
older than my daughter was.
 Do you think
that diminishes your loss?
 I think my loss is just that...
 mine.
 What?
 The fuck, you're pissed?
It's our fucking property,
 and you have me arrested?!
 Not "our".
 I will cut you off
without a cent!
 You think I won't?
 Mom, are you all right?
 Mom, are you okay?
 Mom?
 Mom?
 I hear them too.
 All I want in this world is...
 is what's best for my baby.
 Fucking cops!
 Where the hell have you been?
 Walking five miles.
 Five miles?
 You were right. Okay?
 I'm right? You think
that's what I'm looking for?
 Made a mistake.
 You learn from it?
 Yeah.
 okay, now come here,
give your mom a hug.
 Boys.
 Hands up! Don't move!
 I'm a capable woman, gentlemen, but
I can only do one or the other.
 Shit!
 Well, a capable woman can read
a no-trespassing sign I take it.
 - Yeah.
- You know, that fish badge
 is no get-out-of-jail-free card.
 We're within our rights
to take you in.
 I won't stop you. Just, uh...
 just take a look in there first.
 Jesus Christ!
 What the fuck is that?
 You were right.
 This is so fucked up.
 You should have seen the half
with the head on it.
 Hmm...
 Well, aren't you
a pretty kitten heel?
 Your sensible shoes step
into another pile of shit?
 - Sheriff.
- You know,
 a heads-up would have
walked you through the gates.
 Hate to be a bother.
 And I hate aged rib eye.
 Your deputies
were more than helpful.
 Well,
you'll be the first to say that.
 Sworn.
 Yes, sir.
 Yeah. I understand.
 Mayor's office. It is believed
to be in the best interest
 of the public to withhold
this discovery from the media.
 Why do I feel as though
that is a flagrant misuse
 of the word "public"?
 Not the first time
 the First Amendment's
been liberally interpreted
 when the Godfrey name
might be printed.
 How long have you been
with Fish and Wildlife?
 If there's something you want
to ask me, Tom, go ahead.
 I would if I thought
you'd answer me.
 Hmm, "Quid pro quo
is it now, Clarice?"
 I don't speak Spanish.
 We are looking for an animal,
are we not, Doctor?
 You know the thing people
get wrong about the weatherman?
 He's usually right.
 Yes, sir?
 Some developments.
 Well, aren't you my hero?
 - Hi.
- I swear, if it got
 any more boring here,
I was about to do some homework.
 Shudder.
 Perish the thought.
 Where's Roman?
 Look at you.
You took the bus.
 Miss Independent,
 I like it, but, um...
something tells me
 you're not just here for
my sunny personality, are you?
 Here we go.
 I set them aside for you.
 Believe it or not,
good taste is very rare
 here at the general store
on both sides
 of the counter,
so when we find it,
 we have to defend it. You know,
 the right piece of jewelry
can turn a girl into a woman.
 Not to mention...
a little rebellion.
 Should we go through
the motions at least?
 How was everyone's day?
 Every breath, a gift.
 Where did you disappear
to, darling?
 - I took the bus.
- Seriously?
 I'm sorry. What was that?
 - I took the bus.
- Quit being so goddamn literal.
 Why on earth would you take
the bus anywhere?
 And without my permission...
 Give her a break.
Jesus, I don't even know
 - how to do that! Ha! Ha! Ha!
- I'm sorry. Is this a joke to you?
 Oh, Shelley darling, earrings!
What have you
 done to yourself?
 Did you have
 any hand in this?
 No.
 I'm simply perplexed.
 You want to make
a mockery of yourself?
 You would connive
to demean yourself.
 Do you know what
true deformity is?
 The most intolerable
 and repellent of them all?
 Stupidity.
 - Now remove them.
- Stop.
 I'm sorry.
Was that a command?
 - Leave her alone.
- Or what?
 - Shelley, remove them!
- Leave her alone.
 So help me, you will end up
in the fucking gutter!
 No, I won't.
 - Do you think I'm kidding?
- No.
 I know you're lying.
 I've seen it.
 Seen what?
 The will.
 This summer, when Annette didn't
like the way you talked to her--
 not everyone likes
being called that--
 she took me into her office
and showed me the will
 just to spite you.
 It's all mine.
 I'm sole beneficiary.
 And on my 18th birthday, I gain
control of the entire trust.
 Every cent.
 It's my house,
 it's my money...
 and it always was.
 All you had to do...
 was leave her alone.
 Good night, darlings.
 Hey, Shelley.
 Is that blood?
 Yeah?
 Okay. Okay, calm, calm down.
 I'll be there.
 Is that Olivia?
 No.
 In the end, it was JR
who totally lost his grip.
 I guess he made some pretty
wild accusations about her.
 Like what?
 Dad wouldn't say.
 Must have been some
serious crazy person stuff.
 There was a suicide letter too.
 They found it the next day.
 Do you have any idea
what it might have said?
 I don't know.
 Norman. It's a funny thing
how you can look at something
 a thousand times
without really seeing it.
 This happened to me recently
when I saw the word "gentleman"
 in print,
and for whatever reason,
 for the first time...
 really saw it.
 Gentleman.
 I thought... that's my brother.
 A gentleman
is my brother, Norman.
 She won't let that stand.
 She will bring out
all the worst in you.
 By the time you realize it,
 it's too late...
 because she's already destroyed
the best.
 I could see the look in your eye
the last time we talked,
 but under the circumstances,
 I hope you will understand
 how seriously I mean this.
 Do not let her destroy you.
 JR.
 You're stronger
than I'd ever hoped.
 I know. Go home,
 take a couple of days off.
 Go home!
 Hm!
 I was thinking
about releasing him.
 Where was I
gonna release him to?
 I don't know.
 At the risk of sounding
like a broken record...
 Jesus Christ!
 I have a lead.
 I think something's going on
at the White Tower.
 I don't know
if it's connected or not,
 but I can get us in.
 What?
 No.
 What do you mean, no?
 It's over.
 What are you talking about?
 This is over. We're done.
 Why?
 What?
 You mean the cops? You said,
"Get rid of 'em" and I did.
 What's the problem?
 Okay. Okay.
 It was stupid.
It was really stupid.
 I'm an asshole.
 I'm sorry, okay?
 But come on. Think about
what you're doing.
 You can't walk away
over a stupid thing like that.
 You can't walk away from this.
 - Will you fucking say something?!
- You should go.
 There's no good for you here.
 You should get away
from all this death...
 this town and your name.
 Make it all clean.
 I don't know...
 figure it out from there.
 I bet you'd like that.
 I bet you'd find that
very convenient,
 you gypsy piece of shit!
 You know, if you fuck my cousin,
I'll kill you.
 You're not better than me.
 Oh!
 Hello.
 Good afternoon.
 Come in.
 - Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
 - Sit, please.
- Oh, uh, well, we haven't officially met.
 - Uh, my name--
- I'm sorry.
 Our sons are friends.
 Yeah, I know your son.
 Not much meat on his ribs,
but he didn't say no to seconds.
 Uh...
 Casper, come on. Sorry.
 Down, buddy.
Down. Down, down,
 down, baby.
 Uh, I also knew
your cousin. Was it?
 - Yeah, Vince.
- Right, hmm, well...
 he and I had sort of a...
an arrangement.
 You see, I have this condition,
 and doctors are
of not much help for this...
 particular condition,
but, but there is a substance
 that provides
a great relief which is...
 which is far more easier
 for your people
to procure than...
 than myself presently.
 I don't need it,
you understand?
 But it certainly does take
the edge off, as they say.
 How much do you have left?
 Uh... Oh! I don't know.
 I suppose I would
have to check.
 Five thousand a bottle.
 That's, uh... substantially
more than what Vince asked for.
 Vince thought with his dick.
The stuff you're talking about
 isn't ginkgo biloba.
 The stuff you're talking about
means knocking on some doors
 that were a part of my life way
before I had Peter. Five thousand.
 I don't go lower than that
to knock on those doors.
 But, but you, uh...
 you, you can get it?
 It's okay,
 - there's plenty.
- Uh...
 - you don't mind if I just-- Just one.
- Of course not.
 I wouldn't overdo it, though.
 - Yeah!
- Ha! Ha! Five thousand dollars?
 - Champagne for all my friends!
- Ha! Ha! Oh, my god, Lynda.
 I hope you know what you're doing, because
these people are not to be fucked with.
 No one's fucking anyone.
We just both simply have
 what the other wants.
It's business.
 Johai,as in the essence
 of pure bullshit. Ha! Ha! Ha!
 It's what she wants.
 - I saw Roman's hand.
- Oh, I know, I know.
 He hasn't lifted anything
heavier than his pecker
 - since the day he was born.
- He's capable of a lot more.
 Yeah, but, you know, the only one he's
interested in hurting is himself.
 Peter knows that now.
He had to find out for himself.
 - What about this vargulf?
- Nature will take its course.
 That's what I tried
to tell your son!
 He has to find out for himself.
 What about you?
Are you seeing anybody?
 Ha! Ha! Ha! So what, we're
telling real scary stories now?
 - Yes!
- Yeah, right.
 What did you find out?
 That adulthood is just like
high school with mortgages.
 When did you learn
about mortgages?
 Shut up.
 Shit!
 - So your dad and Olivia were...?
- Doctor
 and patient. JR really lost it.
 In other news,
that guy we found on the road...
 stabbed himself
in the brain last night.
 Oh!
 Roman seemed weird today.
 Yeah, he's pissed at me.
 Why?
 Because there's
a giant Roman-shaped blind spot
 in the way that Roman
sees things.
 What happened Saturday night?
 Were you there
when he was arrested?
 Ha! Your mom using
the sheriff's department
 as a timeout isn't the same
thing as getting arrested.
 What are the things
you're leaving out?
 You don't need to leave stuff
out just because I'm a girl.
 I should sock you.
 Um... you want some water?
 Sure.
 Thanks.
 Um...
 Do you believe in angels?
 It scares my parents
 'cause they don't believe me.
 But I guess I wouldn't either
in their shoes.
 I know it sounds
a little crazy.
 It actually sounds
a lot like crazy.
 Do you believe me?
 I don't know.
 Are you just saying
you don't know
 because you don't believe me, or
'cause you think I'm crazy or...?
 Well... yeah, I think
you're pretty crazy,
 but I still don't know.
 Well?
 Well what?
 Are you gonna try and fuck me?
 Yeah. Here we are.
 What kind of a thing
is that to say?
 What is that?
 Roman.
 What does Roman
 have to do with the price
of rice in China?
 You know.
 Do you like me?
 - Are you sure it's not...?
- No, that's, um...
 that's actually kind of sexy.
 Pervert.
 Look, if the dynamite's
already on the tracks
 you'd think twice
about stepping on that train.
 Smooth talker.
 So you're really saying no?
 Godfrey Steel.
 Shut up and kiss me.
 You're Roman Godfrey?
 Yeah.
 - You're bleeding.
- Close shave.
 Hmm, let me see.
 - It's fine.
- Hold still.
 Keep it clean,
 you should live.
 I'm Clementine Chasseur.
I'm with the...
 You know who I am.
 You're the dogcatcher.
 May I ask how you come
to know that?
 Small pond.
 - Is your mother home?
- No.
 You expect her?
 Speak with you?
 Um...
 Hey, Shelley.
 This is Dr. Chasseur.
 - She's here to take a bite
out of the vargulf. - Excuse me?
 It's fine.
 Please.
 Roman, I'd like to ask you
a few questions but before I do
 there's something
that I'd like you to do for me.
 I want you to think about what
kind of person you want to be.
 I'm here because people
are getting hurt.
 The more honest you are with me, the more
it will help me do something about it.
 So just take a second
and think about that, okay?
 I'm... I'm kind of fucked up
right now.
 This is a great opportunity
to do something about it.
 I don't know
what you're going through...
 but I'm not exaggerating
when I say that I'm here
 to save people's lives.
 What is your association
with Peter Rumancek?
 We hang out.
 Anything else you want to
tell me about that relationship?
 Does Peter believe
he's a werewolf?
 No. People just
say that about him.
 - Any idea why people would say
these things? - They're afraid of him.
 You should hear the things
they say about us.
 I guess you have.
 Do they have any reason
to be afraid?
 No.
 Peter would never hurt anyone.
 Why did you go to the site
of the first murder?
 I followed Peter.
 And what was Peter doing there?
 - Rubbernecking.
- Did you dig up Lisa Willoughby?
 No.
 Did you dig up Lisa Willoughby?
 I said we didn't.
 Yeah, we did.
 Why?
 It was...
it was a ritual or something,
 - a gypsy thing, I don't know.
- Roman, desecration of the dead
 does not fall under the rubric
of "some gypsy thing".
 - It wasn't desecration.
- Then what was it?
 Peter thought
he could help her.
 - She's dead.
- Yeah.
 Peter marches to his own beat.
 You used the word "vargulf".
Why did you use that world?
 'Cause I don't want you
to bother my sister.
 Why do you think
I would bother her?
 I don't want you to think
she's the vargulf!
 When you use that word, what
exactly do you think it means?
 Some...
 It's a kind of sickness.
 It's like hunger
with no appetite.
 Where did you learn that word?
 - I don't know where I learned it.
- Where did you learn this word?
 Peter.
 What can you tell me about
an experiment being conducted
 at the Godfrey Institute
of Biomedical Technologies
 called Ouroboros?
 I know that symbol
means something.
 I mean, every symbol
means something, but that one
 means something.
I don't know, something...
 happening.
 I see things sometimes.
 Do you know what it means?
 I can't tell you
what it means to you.
 I can help you.
 Your cooperation
is very helpful.
 I can do more.
The White Tower, Ouroboros.
 I can find out what it is!
 My father built that place!
My name is Godfrey!
 A name is only a name.
 It's good that you want
to help, Roman.
 It's very good of you,
but you can't.
 Why not?
 God doesn't want you
to be happy.
 He wants you to be strong.
 Roman, would you care
 to introduce our guest?
 I'm Dr. Chasseur.
 I'm on the board
of the biomedical center,
 as you're well aware.
 Could I ask your business here?
 Just due diligence, ma'am.
Didn't mean to intrude.
 Oh! Say no more.
Of course we would be thrilled
 to offer whatever
you would find of assistance.
 Not a pleasant business at all.
Anything we can do.
 May I offer you
 a tea or perhaps a brandy?
 Things are getting
frightful outside.
 I've seen worse.
 Size elevens?
 Well, aren't you
a pretty kitten heel?
 They do leave
quite an impression.
 Roman darling,
 there's not a shortage
of coasters in this house.
 Sorry.
 What happened to your face?
 It's just a scrape.
 Silly monkey.
 - Yeah?
- Hey, Roman.
 Uh, Marie is hysterical.
 This place is a zoo.
 I haven't been able
to get away all day.
 Um... do you have any idea
 where Letha might have gone?
 Yeah, I have an idea.
 Well, if you see her,
can you call me?
 Thanks.
 It's nice to see a man
take what he wants.
 It's nice to be silent
like this
 and not be asked
what I'm thinking.
 I know what you're thinking.
 What's that?
 You haven't felt this right
since you can't remember.
 It makes you feel terrible.
 He's still my brother.
 He's still my husband.
 I didn't know you then.
 But I do now. I know.
 My whole life I've tried
to live a certain way.
 I had a name...
 that meant something.
 Met a girl...
 and that meant something.
 I tried to do right by it all,
 be a good man,
 take the hard path
over the easy.
 I'm not a good man.
 You know exactly
what you need to do.
 It will feel wrong,
 but it will be right.
 It will feel like cowardice,
 but it will be brave.
 You will go home...
 and it will feel this way
because you are a good man.
 But I'm not.
 I'm gonna tell Marie
that I'm leaving her.
 It got a little cold.
 I thought you'd be earlier.
 I suppose all
good things take time.
 What is all this?
 Welcome home, "Dad".
 You smell nice.
 You smell sweet, like a puppy.
 Um...
 Are you serious?
 Uh, um...
 You should know that, uh...
 I'm not a very good boyfriend
to have.
 Don't be
such a big hairy idiot.
 You smell so good.
 What I mean is that what
you're talking about is a...
 ...that's a whole deal
and everything.
 What? Fucking?
 Huh?
 Do you want to know the first
moment I knew it would be you?
 No.
 Liars! Fucking liars!
 Ah...
 Okay!
 Ah...
 Roman?
 There's no light!
 Yeah, the whole
neighborhood's dark.
 Uh, are you all right?
 You wanna come here and talk
about cute boys all night?
 - Or do you want to dance?
- No.
 - It's just rain!
- Roman, maybe you better come inside.
 - I should go.
- No, come on,
 I'll get you out
of those wet clothes.
 Come on!
 Well, you have the legs for it.
 Sorry.
 What's wrong?
 Roman.
 My god, what happened?
 It's okay. It's okay.
 - I should go.
- You keep saying that.
 You're here.
 Why don't you tell me
about it, huh?
 Huh?
 Maybe you should talk about it.
 Roman?
 Huh? What's wrong?
 I'm ugly.
 What?
 - I'm an ugly person.
- Oh, Roman.
 I have an ugliness
it's impossible to love.
 That's not true,
 that's not true.
 My god!
How could you think that?
 You're beautiful.
 Yes.
 Really?
 You're crazy, you know that?
 Jesus!
 Oh!
 You ought to be locked up.
 Your turn.
 Roman?
 Roman?
 Roman, are you okay?
 Can you untie me?
 Roman? Can you untie me?
I don't like this.
 Okay, untie me. Ah!
 Roman, can you untie me, please?
 Ah! What are you doing?
Get off me!
 Ah! Roman!
 Stop! Ah!
 Get off!
