 Fucking gypsy.
 Fuck him. Fuck him.
 Fuck you! Fuck you,
 you little fucking faggot!
 Fuck!
 Fuck!
 Can I help you? Hey!
 You know who I am.
 Why don't you sit
the fuck down?
 I would sooner you didn't.
 - Stay the fuck away from me!
- Please give it to me.
 I don't think either of us would
enjoying explaining to Olivia
 - how you lost a hand.
- What's back there? Is it Ouroboros?
 Frankly, you don't even have
to give it to me.
 I would just be substantially
more comfortable
 - if you extinguished it.
- Ouroboros.
 I'm sorry?
 The fucking snake.
 What is it? Why is it
in my dreams?
 What a fascinating thing
to ask.
 - I can make you tell me.
- I would sooner you didn't.
 Unless you plan on rearranging
your positron emissions,
 you'll have to let me through.
 I apologize for the walk.
Where we are going,
 there are certain
electromagnetic irregularities
 that make elevators...
 problematic. When Jacob Godfrey
 first saw Henry Bessemer's
revolutionary new process
 for making steel,
he said the words,
 "Mr. Bessemer, I'd like
to buy the future".
 Your father said the same words
to me our first meeting,
 when I was a pariah
of my own community.
 It's quite a mantle being
passed on to you, young man.
 You think I don't know that?
 What is this?
 Exactly what it looks like.
 This is Project
Ouroboros, Roman.
 Oh, my god. You--
 - You can see why we're
rather sensitive about it.
 An appetite.
 Someone has replaced this rake
with a child of mine.
 And it smiles.
 You know that feeling when you have a
toothache and you don't know how bad it is
 - until it's gone?
- Yep.
 Well, I wasn't gonna
say anything,
 but I think you're better off
without this tooth.
 - Can I have some juice?
- Yeah.
 Huh. It's not my shade.
 Well, we're making
all kinds of friends.
 I'm a friendly guy.
 Does this friend have a name?
 Yeah.
 Does her friend need
to have his ear twisted?
 Hey, babe.
 - It's Letha.
- Lisa?
 Letha. It's like
Lisa but with a lisp.
 Well, um, I think
it's meant to be
 'cause neither one of you
know how to wash a glass.
 It's Letha Godfrey.
 Are you doing this on purpose?
 I'm not doing anything.
 It has nothing to do with him.
 Does he know that?
 I could care less.
 Well, give it a shot for me.
 Hey!
 Hey! Let me out of here!
 Let me out of here! Let me out of here!
Let me out of here, you fucking maniac!
 That is Project Ouroboros.
 My beautiful boy.
 He was agitated
 and clearly had been
using narcotics.
 I was afraid he was
a danger to himself,
 but I only gave him a sedative.
His brain activity
 is normal and there's no
physiological explanation
 for his condition.
And we're on Norman's turf now,
 but I suspect he's had
a severe psychic break.
 He's preventing himself
from waking up.
 He's coming home, Johann.
 I would strongly advise
against that.
 His condition needs
to be monitored.
 He's coming home.
 Road policing
in your jurisdiction now?
 This is Roman Godfrey's
car, isn't it? I understand
 it was found abandoned
somewhere near the White Tower.
 What you understand gets
more complicated every day.
 What can I say?
 - I'm into the I's and t's.
- No, you're not.
 Professional courtesy
extends both ways.
 I'm sorry. Have I been
discourteous?
 Your trip to the Godfrey
house didn't go unnoticed,
 or that I had to hear about it
so long after the fact.
 So let me make this
plain to you.
 If the issue involves,
as your patch suggests,
 fish and wildlife,
 have at it. Otherwise,
 stay out of police business.
 Point taken.
 Back to my original
question--
 - Yeah, not far from the tower.
 The first thing he'll feel
when he wakes up will be...
 the warmth of the sun
on his face.
 It'll be a pleasant feeling.
 He'll wonder
that he ever felt ill.
 Perhaps there'll be
a song of a bird,
 a mourning dove.
 I saw a pair just yesterday.
They haven't all gone yet.
 Strength and sorrow,
 give no thus to those
you love the most.
 Come back.
 You promised you wouldn't
leave me. I need you.
 Come back.
 - Come back. - You could have at least
left me my fucking cigarettes!
 I could really use a goddamn
cigarette right now!
 Sometimes I think that the only
thing that ever really made you happy
 was your dead father's car.
 Who are you?
 I'm the one who took
your cigarettes.
 You know I hate
how much you smoke.
 - Who are you?
- Oh, please.
 - Oh, please.
- Where am I?
 In my room, breaking my heart,
you jerk.
 Breaking my heart, you jerk.
 - Come back. - Come back.
- Shelley?
 Come back.
 Pryce fucking drugged me.
 Oh, your system's
been through worse.
 He's not the reason you're here.
 Then what is?
 Why not ask your razor
the next time you cut yourself?
 A common motif
in Greek mythology
 is the catabasis,
 a ritualized descent
into the underworld
 to accomplish a necessary task
 or defeat a dangerous adversary.
 What? I'm a fucking scorpion.
 Be careful what you say you are,
because that is what you are.
 - What do I do about it?
- You need to do what you came here to do.
 - What is that? - You need to turn those
pretty eyes inward toward the monster
 ripping you apart. Destroy the Dragon
before its fire burns you alive!
 Jesus Christ!
 A Springfield?
 What happened
to my Remington girl?
 She almost put two
in your anginal heart.
 You were always an ace
at this range,
 center mass grouping,
perfect sight picture.
 What the fuck
are you doing here?
 I was concerned
 after our last call.
 How is your sight picture
 these days, hmm?
 You know, Dad never really
talks about his brother.
 Well, it's not an easy thing
for him to discuss.
 Believe me, I've tried.
 It's what he might call
repression.
 Your father's very good
at his job,
 but he could stand to point that powerful
psychiatric microscope at himself once in a while.
 Do it!
 Okay. How did I use
to do this?
 I am deeply concerned.
 That's good.
You almost have it.
 You almost have it. You're
doing more of a frown thing.
 It's really just more
of a sort of constipated...
 completely straight
line. Hello.
 It is said that what women
fear most is violence from men,
 but what men fear most
is being laughed at by women.
 Hmm. I'm deeply
concerned by that.
 Ha, ha, ha! You know, it's uh,
 it's a good thing I leave
the office from time to time
 or I might mistake myself
 - for a respected man.
- Yes, honey, it is a very good thing
 that you leave
the office. Hi.
 - No. They don't work on you.
- Really?
 Well, you're missing
the gravitas acquired by years
 - of stoic suffering.
- Oh, you mean wrinkles.
 Hello?
 What?
 Hang on. I don't understand
what you're telling me.
 Okay, I'll come right over.
 What's wrong?
 Roman's in a coma.
 This is how you see yourself?
 This is how you
make me see myself.
 Thank you.
 - When did you learn those words?
- You were the only thing
 holding us together.
You always were.
 I just wish I could
teach you how to see yourself.
 What happened?
 A drug overdose.
 Can we talk downstairs?
 I haven't been in that
attic in 30 years.
 You know he should be
in a hospital.
 He's staying here.
 What drugs?
 A number, evidently.
 He was causing a scene
at the institute
 and Johann sedated him.
 Sedated him? That's
not sedation, Olivia.
 That's a coma.
 You left Pryce still breathing?
 The coma is Roman's,
 not Johann's. He did
what he had to do.
 - Why was he there?
- I don't know.
 I suppose Johann
 - doesn't either.
- Let it go, Norman.
 Do you know anything
about Project Ouroboros?
 I told you, I haven't got any better
idea what goes on there than you do.
 Then why was he there?
 Something's going on here.
You can't act like it's not.
 Liv.
 Liv, Liv, Liv.
 You know, you don't have
to do that anymore.
 Protect me from the truth.
 I know him.
 I'm sorry.
 Do you think
he's gonna wake up?
 Well,
 I think that's up to Roman now.
 The Godfrey boy's in a coma.
 I know. The heart aches.
 Nic.
 You old leg-humper.
 You know, there are better places
to have this conversation.
 We have time.
 We always have had time
 for each other.
 You also seem to have exhausted the
patience of the local law enforcement.
 Seems Roman Godfrey
had quite the night.
 It's the White Tower. There's
something happening there.
 Pryce is playing liar's poker.
 Francis Pullman saw his hand,
 drove a titanium syringe three
inches into his temporal lobe.
 - And Rumancek?
- They were at the mill.
 They found the rest
of Willoughby.
 Or left her there.
 I'm not so sure.
 No sooner did the Hardy Boys break up but
their mothers are seeing each other.
 Olivia Godfrey.
 She was at the mill too.
 Her name is on the place.
 This was not
the first body to fall there.
 Prior to her taking
that name in 1993,
 there's no scrap
of history to be found.
 But a woman like that...
 I suspect JR Godfrey's not the first
man to lose his head over her.
 I think she might be upir.
 - Why are we talking about Olivia Godfrey?
- Do I need to repeat myself?
 - I sent you here to hunt an animal.
- And I found a whole herd.
 Then what are we doing
in Peter Rumancek's trailer?
 I don't know.
 "I found myself in a dark wood,
 for the straight way was lost."
 If you're trying
to inform my direction,
 I'd rather you didn't
quote the Inferno.
 Dante had his Virgil
to guide him.
 Let me be yours.
 Forget Olivia Godfrey.
 Her footprint's
at the crime scene.
 - I confirmed it.
- She's a diversion.
 - She's a suspect. - You have great
instincts for the hunt, Clementine.
 Trust them.
 Clear your head
 and bring me Peter Rumancek.
 Thank you for coming back.
 I love you.
 I love you.
 Is this where the Dragon is?
 I don't know.
Ask yourself, Roman.
 You're the one with
the questions and the answers.
 Will you come with me?
 I can't.
You won't be alone.
 Everyone you blame for your mistakes is
waiting for you just on the other side.
 - I'm a warrior. Warrior!
- Prove it.
 All right.
 I'm here.
I can help you.
 Biologically speaking,
young girls have a blood rite
 that initiates them into adulthood,
whether they are ready for it or not.
 To compensate, all tribal cultures put
their young males through some ordeal
 at puberty, separating
the boy's world from the man's.
 It's not your fault
you're weak, Roman.
 - I'm not weak.
- You think Peter would cry over you?
 It's unusual for the knight
to take the king.
 The bishop
 has far greater talent
for the end game.
 Kneel.
 You think the Dragon
 gives a shit
about your nobility?
 He's gonna eat you alive.
 He's gonna eat you alive.
 He's gonna eat you alive!
 Have a seat.
 Roman, Roman, Roman.
 How can I help you?
 I'm looking for the Dragon.
 Well, let's see
what my Swiss colleague
 has to say about this.
 - Doctor. - The subject here
is in an unconscious condition,
 which he believes to be his catabasis, and
he won't be able to reach the surface
 if he doesn't "confront
the Dragon", Doctor.
 All consciousness
separates, but in dreams
 we put on the likeness
of the more universal,
 truer, more eternal man
 in the darkness
of primordial night.
 Oh, well, his sister's appearing to
him in the form of a guide, Doctor.
 To deliver a classic
 messiah archetype.
 We know that our Shelley
lends herself to this, Doctor.
 Then you believe
the purpose of this episode
 - to be redemption, Doctor.
- It is recommended
 that the subject
search for clues
 within the dream landscape.
 In this instance,
 the Dragon is clearly
 the subject's own shadow,
 the most repressed
of his inner thoughts.
 As for the oft-mentioned
 representation, Ouroboros,
 the snake
 consuming its own tail,
 I could go on and on,
 but ironically,
 it will not be apparent
 to a young boy
 with such a sense of self-fellatio.
 Ha, ha, ha!
 What are the stakes
of this narrative?
 I mean, if this is all in his head, what's
the worst thing that can happen to him?
 Step a little closer,
please, Doctor.
 Oh.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 A word of advice, young man.
 Too much of the animal
 dislocates the civilized
human being.
 Too much culture
 makes a sick animal.
 - Well, that's very helpful!
- Roman, what I'm curious about
 is, if you're dealing with
repressed unconscious contents,
 what exactly I'm doing here? It seems
like you'd have more to say to Olivia.
 Yeah. Where is your mother?
 - I'd really like to give her
a piece of my mind. - Ha!
 Sit down.
 I was only a few years older than you
when I took over the Godfrey steel.
 It was close to insolvency.
 I got us back in the black.
I was the hero of the town.
 Is he fucking
kidding me with this?
 What was I supposed to do?
Watch the town slowly commit suicide,
 - or give it a future?
- Fuck your legacy!
 You're a coward.
Why did you do it?
 When your older
sister, Juliet, was born,
 your mother had about as much
interest in holding her as a wet towel.
 When you were born,
on the other hand...
 Give him to me.
 Give him to me!
Give him to me!
 Give him to me!
 Give him to me!
Give him to me!
 I knew I couldn't
protect you from her.
 She wouldn't let me.
 You left me alone.
You left me alone with her.
 Roman, half of her is in you.
 - That's your only chance.
- The only chance of what?
 Don't you find it odd you've never met
anyone from her side of the family?
 You think they don't know about you?
You were better off on your own
 - than with a waste of a father.
- Fuck you for making that decision for me.
 Fine.
 I was better off.
 But you can talk to him
 about your feelings about it.
 He's your real dad, anyway.
He's your real dad, anyway.
 Have you people ever considered
 that Roman might quit pulling this shit
if you just stopped fucking letting him?
 This isn't you.
 I know you.
 Don't make this my problem.
 No petting in
the halls, Rumancek.
 You paid your money!
 You paid your money!
You paid your money!
 You paid your fucking money!
 You said you'd give me a ride.
 It was you.
 I don't want to see that.
 I don't want to see that!
 Is that blood?
 Stupid-ass birds!
 Are you okay?
 We're in this together.
 Holy fuck!
 - Say what you have to say to me.
- We're in this together, you and I.
 Why do you need that
to be true so badly?
 Why can't you admit it?
 I guess we're both scorpions.
 Is there anything
I can do to fix this?
 It's like the hottest,
 wettest pussy on earth.
 What?
 That's what fear smells like.
 I heard about the boy.
 You know, I never
wanted you to get mixed up
 with that family
in the first place,
 but there's what you want
 and then there's what happens,
 so what do you think
you end up living with?
 We had the same dreams.
 I thought that meant something.
 The heart is smarter than
the head, even when it isn't.
 You are exactly the man
 Nicolai knew you'd be.
 You really are.
 I'd say I don't know
how I got to be so lucky,
 but we're Rumanceks, so...
 Boy, you just, you don't let
a person get a word in edgewise.
 Ah, a smile.
 Finally.
 Mrs. Godfrey.
 There's a tone of a question
in your voice as if we haven't met.
 I do have a few,
if you have a moment.
 Such a peaceful place.
 That is an observation,
not a question.
 I did want to ask your opinion about
the upsetting discovery at your mill.
 Discoveries, I should say.
 - You're a remarkable cunt.
- I'm sorry?
 My son is upstairs
in a coma and you come to me
 - with questions of what?
- I'm sorry. I didn't know he was here.
 And just what did you think
you discovered? Your entire life
 is nothing but a question.
 Now, either say something
to me worth my time
 or go sniff out your animal
and directly fuck off
 back to whatever Ohio
tragedy birthed you.
 And how did you know Ohio?
 I'll pray for your son.
 You will do no such thing.
 Afraid he'll be saved?
 You know, also, the thing
 that we all keep
forgetting here--
 we're all just animals.
 You have to hurry, Roman.
 - I didn't realize there was a rush.
- Yes, you did.
 Why should I trust you?
 Why should I trust you?
 You say you're my guide,
 but we're not going anywhere.
 A labyrinth is
not a maze, Roman.
 A maze is designed to mislead. A
labyrinth, no matter which way you step,
 you're always going
in the right direction.
 It's leading you to the center.
You have to hurry, Roman.
 - Why?
- You're running out of time!
 You're such a child, Roman.
 People are going to die;
you're going to die!
 - Shelley!
- Grow up, Roman! No one cares anymore!
 I'm sorry! Please come back.
Shelley! Shelley!
 - No, no, no, no, no.
- Grow up, Roman!
 - We're not here forever.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
 No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.
 I'm ready for you!
I'm ready for you!
 Here I am! Here I am!
 Where the fuck did it go?
 Roman!
 - Roman, help me!
- No!
 No!
 Shelley?
 Shelley?
 What is this?
 You are ugly, Roman.
 You're looking for a monster?
 Look in the coke mirror.
 Look in the coke mirror.
 Stop!
 Ooh... Tsk, tsk, tsk.
 What does that mean?
 Can I go up yet?
 Oh, sweetie,
 you've barely
scratched the surface.
 You haven't done
what you came here for.
 What does the Dragon want
from me?
 What do you want from him?
What do you want from him?
 You're running out of time.
 You must make your heart steel.
 Please.
 Please forgive me.
 I was so fixated on the man
I wanted you to become
 that I missed the boy
you still are.
 I'm so afraid.
 I've spent so many years
building this life for us.
 It wouldn't be the first time I broke
something excellent and beautiful
 because tightening my grip
 comes more naturally to me
than letting go.
 I've lost everything before.
 Sacrifice, you don't know
 the meaning of the word.
 It's not in me to lose you,
 even if it means letting you go.
 Hello.
 I brought this. For him.
 I thought it might help him
 with his... travels.
 Thank you. I...
 I believe that it will.
 - Would you like to come upstairs
and see him? - Ah, no.
 I'm actually pretty fucking bad
at these kind of things,
 if you want to know
the truth. Yeah.
 Well, uh...
 Uh, Peter?
 Perhaps if he...
 had met someone
like you sooner, he...
 he wouldn't be where he is now.
 Goodbye.
 Mm.
 We had sex over there.
 Don't look so proud
of yourself.
 Children.
 They're all just children.
 The alchemists believed a creative
work has a sort of life all its own,
 independent of
the creator, comma,
 straddling the worlds
of matter and psyche,
 of both and neither.
 Full stop.
 A subtle body, they called it.
 Full stop.
 Can you think what
you would do to protect it?
 Question mark.
 The sedation of the boy was unfortunate,
comma, but in his condition,
 as necessary as his witness
to the work.
 Full stop. Should he wake,
 a report of Ouroboros
will never be believed.
 Semicolon.
 And knowing the truth,
 he is invalidated. Full stop.
 They won't stop me.
 Then it will all have been
 for nothing.
 It's taking everything I have
not to lose it.
 I want a voice so I can scream!
 It hurts so much.
 Others can love without hate--
 no conditions.
 But not you,
 not my proud brother Roman.
 No, you'd rather die first,
 so you take it out
on everyone around you.
 You promised you'd always be
here for me,
 but you're a liar!
You're selfish and...
 and you know
how much I love you,
 but I hate you
for making me see it.
 I have always defended you,
but I cannot defend this.
 You are not allowed
to remove yourself from my life.
 Wake up, Roman.
Please, come back.
