 I didn't kill her.
I figured it was you.
 Me? Why would I do it?
 Why would I?
 People are saying
you're a werewolf.
 Do you believe every rumor
you hear?
 Then why are we both here?
 When listening to all those people,
you ever hear of a coincidence?
 Are you sure it wasn't you?
 You could try to contain
your disappointment.
 Then who was it?
 Bear? Cougar?
 Creative suicide?
 It's weird.
 I knew her. I mean,
I didn't KNOW HER know her,
 but... but to see her--
parties and stuff.
 She liked my car.
 It's a nice car.
 I also knew your uncle.
 Vince.
 He did some kind of work
for my mom.
 She denies it,
but she's so full of shit.
 I liked his stories.
 The girls would get pretty
freaked out, but girls,
 you know?
 Yeah, that sounds like Vince.
 What's it like? Living like,
 you know, you people.
 I guess there's always something
over the hill I gotta see.
 What's the story
of your sister?
 - Shit!
- It's cool. It's cool.
 Don't run. Don't run.
 It's that Godfrey kid.
 You know, it's a school night.
 - I'm a night owl.
- What the hell are you doing here?
 Am I disturbing anyone,
officer?
 You mean other than
a dead girl's murder site?
 - So who's that with you, huh?
- It's that punk gypsy. - Now,
 what could you two little
birdies possibly be hatching
 out here that we might
look upon favorably?
 - We were having a conversation.
- About what?
 - The mysteries of mortality.
- OK, come on, let's go.
 But my old lady's gonna be
a pain in the balls.
 You know, on second thought,
his old lady's gonna be
 - a pain in the balls.
- What?
 - It's true.
- It's true.
 Spooky fucker.
 How'd you do that?
 Do what?
 Dearest Uncle,
 Time again for you
to indulge my prattle,
 though I suppose I address you
as 'Doctor' here,
 as this correspondence was your
professional recommendation.
 Now, what's happened
since I last wrote?
 You'd be so proud of me, Uncle.
 I followed your advice
and asserted myself to mother.
 Is that what you want, honey?
 Salad?
 No, no.
 Her usual will be
quite satisfactory.
 Darling, you must
eat your meat.
 To which Roman made
an off-colored remark.
 Jenny, my most favorite
of the staff,
 with whom he regularly engages in
light flirtation, hid a smirk.
 - Mother was cross.
- Oh, now,
 she's just thinking
about her figure.
 All those cute boys
in high school.
 Her usual will be
 quite satisfactory.
 I am more than some living
marionette who will dance at the pull
 of her strings. As you said,
I am an intelligent,
 autonomous individual
with valid desires.
 And though mother was correct--
 my stomach was rumbling
its second guess
 before we got home--
 I believe your niece earned
some small measure of--
 dare she say it?--respect.
 Otherwise, I'm finding
the transition to high school
 genial enough.
Of course, tensions remain
 over the tragedy weeks ago.
Both within the school
 and without.
 Answering violence
with violence.
 But the attack, it would appear,
was an isolated one.
 The gypsy boy I referred to
continues to favor me
 with his charms.
The kids at the school say
 he is a werewolf-- a comment, I
assume, on the boy's admittedly
 excessive body hair.
 I do hope he was not involved
in the incident
 at Kilderry Park. Of course,
 if I am to live
with the decision,
 I suppose I ought to take care
with questions
 to which I may prefer
not to know the answers.
 Yours always.
 Your daughter's pregnant.
 Right there.
Right there.
 Uh...
 this is...this is exactly
what it looks like.
 Did you have anything
to do with it?
 Why thank you, Olivia.
 Don't think. Answer.
 Were you and that walking
god complex in any way involved?
 Norman, you'll really have to be
a little more goddamn specific.
 Letha... is pregnant.
 Ah.
 Well, I'm afraid you'll find
me inadequate to such a task,
 and as for Dr. Pryce, I think we both know his...
proclivities lie elsewhere.
 I am not fucking around here!
 Lower your voice. Sit down.
 No.
 I had nothing to do with it.
 Nor, to my knowledge,
did Dr. Pryce.
 And frankly, that you would feel
compelled to ask would be...
 beyond outrageous were it
one iota less mystifying.
 Has it occurred to you
she might be
 reluctant to share
with her father
 - the specific circumstances
of the fornication? - Reluctant.
 Uh, no. Not reluctant.
 She says...
 ...she's still a virgin.
She says...
 it was an angel.
She said it visited her
 this summer and she didn't say
anything at the time
 'cause she didn't want us
getting all bent out of shape--
 her words--um, but she felt
the time had come
 that she needed our help
with the... child.
 And she took a pregnancy test, so
she's not hallucinating that part.
 - Has she got a boyfriend?
- None lately.
 - Been going to church?
- When have you known this family
 to go to church
when someone hasn't died?
 And what's your professional
evaluation?
 Rape.
 She was raped,
and her mind bricked it over
 with this fantasy. The...
 clinical term is
psychogenic amnesia.
 Have you contacted the police?
 With what?
My suspicion of something
 that would've happened in July
that she won't corroborate?
 At this point, my hope is
to talk her out of keeping it.
 Is that for the best?
 Oh, as opposed to encouraging
her to carry to term a child
 she is convinced is a product
of immaculate conception at...
 17, when at any minute the actual
event could come back to her
 after an irrevocable decision
has been made.
 Now, might I ask, what could
possibly give you the notion
 - I have any involvement in this?
- Because...
 ...I honestly have
no fucking idea
 what you would be capable of
if you were afraid of losing me.
 Where's my t--
 I was afraid you meant it.
Last time.
 I meant it.
 I didn't want this to happen.
This was--
 - Spiteful.
- Weak.
 We'll agree to agree.
 Frightful business,
this Pemrose girl.
 Your daughter thinks
it was a werewolf.
 Well, I guess ours both have
impressive imaginations.
 Still...
 it does hold a terribly erotic
sort of appeal,
 being hunted down
 and devoured by a savage brute.
 Oh, it's enough
to give one the shivers.
 I meant it.
 What makes you think
I don't know that?
 Attention students.
 The following announcement is
from Miss Fletcher.
 In lieu of the Bluebell
killing, a list
 of non-acceptable costumes will
be listed on the bulletin board.
 Any student not complying will
 not be permitted
to tonight's dance.
 Also, there will be
a small police presence.
 This is only a precaution,
 but I warn you
that students attempting
 to sneak off the school premises
cannot be taken lightly.
 Hold it! Cool.
 So, you going to this dance?
 Oh. Guess there's not much point
in me going then, huh?
 Pfft.
 Wolf fucker.
 I'm sorry.
 Don't be sorry.
 You're too pretty.
 Get your fucking hands
off my sister, man.
 Is this funny
 to you?
 I'm just...
 - You want a lift home?
- Why?
 Whatever. Why not?

 Nicolae has the biggest boner

 - He's my grandfather.
- Ah.
 We like wheels, us people.
 Yeah, my dad used to drive me
 around in it.
He knew every back road
 and speed trap
for a hundred miles.
 My mom would have killed him if she knew
the way he would drive with me in the car.
 If he hadn't beat her to it.
 Where's your dad?
 Still out for the proverbial
pack of smokes, I suppose.
 You know, they say that being
raised by a single mother
 makes you more sensitive
to, like, chicks and stuff.
 - Yeah?
- Yeah.
 Well, I'm a pretty
sensitive guy.

 Weird.
 - What?
- I had a dream about that the other night.
 You can feel it, can't you?
 What?
 Whatever it is

 The septic tank?
 Deeper.
 I get this feeling sometimes,
 like something really important
is about to happen.
 Thanks for the ride.
 As an artist, you could use
a little development.
 Homecoming. You goin'?
 Ah, I am home.

 At least you're done
with a that creep Peter.
 She had
a Tyler moment.
 What do you mean
she had a Tyler moment?
 Well, he picked me to play the
mirror game in theatre class,
 and... well, I don't know,
 - we just... had a moment.
- Pinkalicious.
 OK, how do you even know
what a moment is?
 I've had a moment before.
 Mm-mm, the jet at the pool
doesn't count.
 Will you let her tell
her story, you fistula?
 So, you're playing
the mirror game.
 And he was pretending
to be hitting his golf club,
 and he was sticking his butt
way out,
 and, I mean, I'm making it sound
really dumb,
 but...the way he was doing it,
it was actually really cute,
 and... it was definitely
a moment.
 I think.
 Midnight cherry.
 Tyler? Didn't Tyler go out
with Letha Godfrey?
 Then he definitely has a type. You know,
she's the only bigger prude than Christina.
 - I know. - I know, right?
- I'm not a prude!
 This is high school.
 - Things are gonna be different.
- Uh-huh.
 People can change.
Who says they can't?
 - Powder brush.
- Absolutely. It's menses.
 - Definitely menses.
- Yes.
 - Yeah. - It's not.
- Yeah, it is.
 Which one's this?
 The Breathe Project.
 It's gonna take a lot
of elbow grease
 to clean up the air in this town after
what the Godfreys have done to it.
 How do I look?
 You're really going?
 I'm still me, Dad.
 Oh, he's not even gonna
come in?
 It's Roman, Mom.
 - Not a date.
- You look perfect.
 Thank you.
 Love you.
 - Bye.
- Buh-bye, sweetheart.
 Have fun. Don't stay out
too late.
 Of course not.
 Listen here, prostitute. I don't
know what you did with my cousin,
 but we're not leaving
until you spill, see.
 Good to see you too.
 And what are you supposed
to be?
 Unimpeachable.
 Fuckin' needles.
 Fuckin' needles.
 You fuckin' needles.
Fuckin'...
 There's no such thing
as a needle that big.
 There's no--
 Motherfuckers.
 They can't take that
and then give it back.
 I didn't sign up for this!
 - Watch your tutu!
- Watch your own tutu!
 - Rawr.
- OK, whatever. We look hot anyway.
 - I know. We're pretty hot.
- Yeah, we're hot. I know.
 - Don't worry, you look good too.
- You look hot, OK? You do.
 Ugh. Is that slutty hippie
 - Ashley Valentine? How original!
- Maybe she was going for
 regular hippie but Ashley
Valentine makes it slutty.
 - Girls, you know I don't appreciate
that word. - Really?
 That's a shame, because you have
know idea what deviant acts
 - she has planned for to--
- Shut up!
 - Alexa, seriously.
- Dad, I'm Alexa. - She's Alexa.
 Right.
 OK, 10 o'clock sh--
10 o'clock sharp.
 - Oh, here he goes.
- Right here.
 - Ten o'clock sharp, right here.
- Dad, you're so annoying.
 No wandering. An isolated incident's
only isolated until it's not, right?
 OK. Give it to me.
 - Thank you. Have fun.
- Bye.
 - I'm gonna get laid tonight.
- Me too.
 Oh, are you looking
for your boyfriend Tyler?
 He's not my boyfriend.
 Oh, right, you're probably
looking for the other one.

 Hey.
 - Hey.
- I just wanted
 to see how you were doing.
 I heard that you and Brooke
Bluebell were friends.
 Oh.
 Yeah.
 Fuckin' sucks.
 Well, if you ever need someone
to talk to, I'm here.
 Is it me, or is every Tyler
a complete waste of conception?
 So, did you want to come here and talk
about cute boys all night, or do you want
 - to dance?
- No.
 You're a real fucking
sociopath, you know that?
 I don't even know
how that's defined exactly,

 So, um, what brings a person
as shy as you to drama club?
 I'm not shy.
 I just... choose my words
carefully.
 Well, I guess...
 What was that?
 What?
 I thought I heard something.
 Anyway, I'm a writer,
 so I thought maybe it would
help me with those words and...
 yes, come out of my shell.
 I thought it was, like, a law that
all girls had seen Dirty Dancing,
 so guys didn't look like complete
idiots when they use it to flirt.
 Sorry, I wasn't
actually saying that...
 Fuckin' shit!
 Hey, let's split.
 - Now?
- I'm so bored.
 This thing is like a kind

 "There is a fucking wrong

 Your ex-husband.
 The president
of the WASP society.
 Norman.
 I was trying to eavesdrop,
 mainly to figure out
what he possibly could be saying
 other than
 begging for you
to take him back.
 I guess that's why
he was crying, the poor guy.
 Sorry. I didn't mean
to get all

 Don't... make me

 Shut up.

 Roman, start the car.
 Is it Tyler?
 No, it's not Tyler.
 Now, can you please start the car
and stop being such a drama queen?
 - Who?
- I don't want to talk about it
 - until you start the car.
- Who?
 You sound like the world's
dumbest owl right--
 - Who?!
- Stop it, Roman.
 Stop it!
 It was an angel.

 What do you mean,

 Literally?
 It was an angel.
 Tell me about it.
 How do you explain dancing

 I have legs that won't quit.
 They're adjusting.
 Mom's just getting to the point
where she can admit it,

 Hey, you OK?
 I don't want

 Is he OK?
 Yeah. Uh, there's this guy
in the road.
 I nearly hit him. I-I think he's
schizophrenic or something.
 Hey.
 What's your name?
 376 about two-two
miles south of the White Tower.
 - Ouroboros.

 Today I've seen the dragon.
 No, it's OK.
 You.
 It was you.

 I saw that cheerleader!
I saw her get killed!
 Hey!
 A good lover.
That is the secret.
 What's that from?
A bad lover?
 You could say that.
 - Upir.
- What's that?
 They are things that look like
you and me, but they are not.
 Clothes, smile, beating heart--
 these things are only masks
hiding the creature beneath.
 But the eyes, ah,
 they show themselves
with the eyes.
 There is such... darkness
 that it shines.
 - Hey.
- Hey.
 You do the reading for Pisaro?
 Nah, I watched the movie.
 You know, I can never keep
the Brontë sisters straight.
 Which one do fat goth girls
learn how to masturbate to?
 Why do I get the feeling that
half the reason you talk to me
 is the way people look at you
when you're talking to me?
 Oh, it's more than half.
 The thing is, we don't have
the same problem.
 Which is?
 You're only bored
if you're boring.
 Yeah. Supermarkets, you know,
they're good for the big stuff,
 feeding the troops, but...
slim on the finer things.
 You know, my cousin Vince used
to say that some appetites
 require a specialty shop.
And with the big-box stores...
 ...you know, they're getting
paid, right? Why tip 'em, right?
 Call me!
 "And the angels were so angry
that they flung me out,
 "into the middle of the heath,
on top of Wuthering Heights,
 "where I awoke sobbing for joy.
 "That will do to explain
my secret, as well as the other.
 "I've no more business to marry Edgar
Linton than I have to be in heaven.
 So, he shall never know
how I love him--"
 Are we passing notes,
 - Mr. Godfrey?
- Wouldn't dream of it, ma'am.
 " ...as well as the other.
 "I've no more business to marry Edgar
Linton than I have to be in heaven.
 "And if the wicked man in there had
not brought Heathcliff so low,
 "I shouldn't have
thought of it.
 "It would degrade me
to marry Heathcliff now,
 so he shall never know
how I love him..."
 He's coming where?!
 I don't know.
He asked me if he could.
 No, no. Look, simple questions
have two possible answers.
 I meant to say no.
 But I opened up my mouth
and something else came out--
 Peter! We've discussed
these people! What the hell--
 Lynda, he's the only one in town
that thinks that I didn't do it!
 Oh, because he did?
 I just...
 I have this feeling
 that something very important is
about to happen.
 I get it. I get it, baby.
I get it.
 'Cause you've never had
a friend.
 I hope those balls know
what they're doin'.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 Come in.
 - Hello.
- Hi.
 Roman, this is Lynda, my mom.
Lynda, this is Roman.
 Are you Hindu or something?
 The photo's the grandfather,
and the statue's Ganesh.
 That's the god of new
beginnings. But I don't think
 Nicolae ever actually
knew that, huh?
 He used to call him Jumbo
and ask if what he had
 between his legs was anything
like what he had on his nose.
 - He was a real class act.
- Sit.
 Oh.
 Milk?
 Sure.
 Honey?
 - Lactic acid.
- Oh. Right, right, right.
 It does funny things
to the tummy.
 So, meeting
a friend of Peter's.
 A first time for everything.
 A very good friend,
 I hope. What are your plans
after graduation?
 I guess my mom will bribe
my way into somewhere decent.
 I see. That's nice.
 He gets nervous beforehand.
Hormones.
 I have a tranquilizer.
 No.
 Yes. Just a little
to wet my whistle. Thank you.
