 (heart beating) (soft music) (static crackling) - [Dispatcher] Fire / Paramedic 33, what is the address of the emergency? - [Caller] I need an ambulance as soon as possible, sir. We have a gentleman here that needs help, and he's not breathing. He's not breathing, and we need to... We're trying to pump him, but he's not, he's not-- - [Dispatcher] Okay.

 Okay, how old is he? - [Caller] He's 50 years old, sir. - [Dispatcher] 50, okay. He's unconscious, he's not breathing? - [Caller] Yes, he's not breathing, sir. - CNN sources are now saying that Michael Jackson is in a coma at UCLA Medical Center. - I don't know what to believe right now. - [Warren] The reaction to Michael Jackson's death is so immediate. (crying) (helicopter whirring) It's volcanic. It was more carnival than human tragedy.

 - [Crowd] Michael! - [Warren] That breakdown, - [Crowd] Michael! (crowd chanting) that chaos draws us in. - [Reporter] Breaking news about Michael Jackson. (gentle music) - [Michael] Peter Pan, to me, represents something that's very special in my heart. Childhood, youth, never growing up, magic, flying. And to me, I just have never, ever grown out of loving that. - [Warren] The Michael Jackson who feels like his childhood has been taken from him finds the perfect symbol in Peter Pan. - [Alan] From way too young, he was always grown up, and what he dreamed of was something that he never had, childhood. - [Toure] Since he was a child, Michael had been dealing with that pressure of constant media attention. He was fodder for more gossip-based media. (crowd cheering) - [Reporter] Jackson was accused of child molestation. - [Reporter] Jackson left his Neverland Ranch this morning, but he never made it to the courthouse. - He landed in the hospital instead. - [Reporter] Jackson has admitted he's addicted to prescription painkillers and is seeking treatment. - [Reporter] This story is not cooling down. Don't expect it to cool down. (crowd yelling) - [Brian] He became better known for what was seen as his outlandish-at-best personal life than his music. (crowd cheering) - [Steven] 2009 was prime to be that breakout moment for him to come back to do a huge tour. (crowd cheering) - [Warren] It was him setting out to harness his image, to gain control again over what and how the public saw him. - [Alan] Everything with Michael Jackson was always in superlatives. The biggest record of all time, (cheering and screaming) the biggest tour ever, (cheering and screaming) the most shows, the fastest ticket sales. (cheering and screaming) That was how he approached everything, and that was what they had teed up. - I'll be performing the songs my fans wanna hear. This is it. I mean, this is really it. This is the final curtain call. - [Toure] He's trying to prove to himself, as well as the world, that I am bigger, badder. The comeback has to be at the highest level. It can't just be one show, five shows. It has to be 50 shows. - [Warren] In 24 hours, a million people around the world had registered to buy tickets for these dates. The 50 dates all sold out within a matter of hours. - [Woman] I have the hottest ticket on the planet right now. - [Woman] I was willing to pay 1,800 pounds to see him. - [Travis] This Is It was going to be the biggest, most innovative revolutionary touring show to date. It was a multimedia extravaganza with new technology, never-before-seen production design techniques, state-of-the-art costumes and equipment and the best dancers in the world. He's going to give us this apex of a performance. It's going to be even better than what was already the best. - [Warren] By the time he's announcing this return to the stage, anything short of a total mind-blowing, unprecedented spectacle ran the risk of being a disappointment. (crowd cheering) Was he really gonna be able to do 50 dates worth of performances after not doing anything for ten years? He's 50-years-old, hasn't been in great health. - [Andy] He's obviously very frail, he's very out of practice, they're dumping a fortune into this thing. Can he even do one show, let alone 50? - [Man] He's not physically strong enough for that many shows. He doesn't put on some weight, he'll never get through it. - [Harvey] We had heard rumblings, and we knew that Michael Jackson was doctor shopping in Beverly Hills so he could get Propofol. - [Man] Jackson's nutritionist tells the Associated Press he begged her to give him a powerful sleeping aid. - [Harvey] There was a lot of concern. We started writing those stories, posting those stories, and we did a lot of them. It became a drumbeat. Getting tips that he wasn't gonna make it, and then hearing contradictory information that no, no, he's fine. (crowd cheering) Michael Jackson was not fine. - [Travis] This Final Curtain Call is not gonna happen like we're hoping. - [Michael] There's nothing to be nervous about, and I love you all, and we're family, just know that. We're a family. (applauding) Blessings, blessings to all. - [Travis] I started with Michael as a dancer in 1992, and This Is It was gonna be the first time that I was going to be directing Michael. - [Travis] It was really a dream come true for me. The 24th was a milestone. We had completed the show. We had all the bones. It was gonna be only up from there. Michael was so happy. He was just like a proud parent. I remember the last things we said to each other was, "I love you," and he'd say, "I love you more." - There's a light that is moving on his command. Right, then when he moves forward, he's in that light. He's in that light. It felt like we were accomplishing the dream. He saw it before him in those rehearsals. He asked me to thank everybody, to tell them that he loved them, the dancers, the singers, the band, the crew, and I gave him a big hug, and he left the building. (helicopter whirring) - [Warren] Michael Jackson is feeling the pressure of career. The only way out of the pressures of that enormus career... (dripping) Sleep. - [Harvey] He got Conrad Murray to live with him and Murray was giving him Propofol in his bedroom at his home on Carolwood almost every night. - [Warren] Propofol is an anesthesia used on patients who are undergoing surgery. It's illegal, it's dangerous. That's completely insane. When you go out with anesthesia, you go right out. He craved that. (crowd cheering) (camera shutter clicking) (yelling) (crowd cheering) (camera shutter clicking) - Please keep an open mind, and let me have my day in court. (crowd cheering) - [Interviewer] How would you describe the pressures of performing? (soft music) - While other kids was out running the streets and playing, those boys would just practice most of the time. - [Michael] Not only were we practicing, we were nervous rehearsing because he sat in the chair and he had this belt in his hand, and if you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, throw you up against the wall hard as he could. Oh my god. It was bad. - [Alan] Michael Jackson never had a childhood because he was performing from so young. What his visions of childhood were were his own fantasies, and that was the thing that he wouldn't let go of. That is the great tragedy of Michael Jackson, and I think explains so much of the disturbing side of it because he was making it up for himself. - [Andy] How can you sleep every night when you know most of the world thinks you did this unspeakably evil thing? Here's a way I can go right out. I can get complete peace through an IV. He just wanted a guarantee he could just have a few hours where he's not hurting. - [Warren] The night after Michael's last rehearsal, he can't sleep. Dr. Murray begins administering drugs. Falling asleep for five minutes, finding himself awake, and then the frustration that he can't get to this thing he needs, making it that much worse. I need more, I need more. He is begging for the Propofol. Let me go into sleep. Let me stop feeling what I'm feeling. Let me fly. (guitar music) (siren wailing) - [Kai] I got into work around 8:00-8:30. I fed the kids their breakfast. Around 12:00, Paris, she starts screaming, "Daddy, daddy, daddy!" Security's running upstairs, skipping stairs, and we're all panicked. (static crackling) - [Dispatcher] Fire / Paramedic 33, what is the address of your emergency? - [Caller] I need an ambulance as soon as possible, sir. - [Warren] Michael is unconscious. - [Caller] We have a gentleman here that needs help, and he's not breathing. We're trying to pump him, but he's not, he's not-- - [Dispatcher] Okay, he's not conscious, he's not breathing? - [Caller] Yes, he's not breathing, sir. - [Dispatcher] Okay, and he's not conscious, either. - [Warren] Dr. Murray makes three calls from his cellphone. - [Michael Amir] He said, "Get here right away. "Mr. Jackson had a bad reaction. "Get somebody up here immediately." - [Dispatcher] Let's get him down to the floor. I'm gonna help you with CPR right now, okay? - [Faheem] Dr. Murray asked the question, "Does anyone know CPR?" And his children, Paris and Prince, were standing outside of his room. Paris was on the ground, balled-up crying. - [Caller] He's pumping, he's pumping the chest, but he's not responding to anything, sir, please. - [Dispatcher] Okay, okay, we're on our way. (sirens wailing) (helicopter chopping) - [Warren] Michael was treated by paramedics on the scene. - [Richard] I see an underweight patient, an IV and medication vials on the nightstand. - [Martin] He was non-breathing, he was non-moving, and his eyes was fixed and dilated. I could tell he was dead. (hospital monitors beeping) - [Ben] One of my photographers was here, posted early in the morning. Shortly after noon, he saw the ambulance arrive, also with a fire truck that parked outside. - [Andy] He was the most famous man on the planet, and a picture of him was worth a fortune, and so he was hunted. (camera shutters clicking) (crowd yelling) - [Ben] Through the firetruck, we could actually see the computer monitor, and it said, "50-year-old male, not breathing." We thought, okay, this is probably Michael, and I saw them pushing the gurney. - [Man] Move, move, move. Go, get off of me! - [Ben] The bodyguards were here trying to prevent us from getting photos. - [Warren] A small paparazzi outfit that was the first to report online that Michael Jackson was headed to the hospital. Moments later, TMZ picked up the story. - [Harvey] We got a tip that Michael Jackson was going to the hospital, so we started calling around. We found out that he had gone into full cardiac arrest. - [Andy] The whole edit staff is in a conference room. I see the editor of our website on TMZ. Her eyes just bulge open. Oh my god. It's pandemonium in our newsroom. TMZ is saying that Michael Jackson collapsed, that he's in the hospital, that he could be dead. - [Andy] We are Rolling Stone. What the hell do we do? All we can do is just hit refresh on TMZ as it gives us more information. They have people all over LA. They pay money and they know who to pay. They got the police stations, at the jails, at the hotels. They've incentivized every person all over LA to just give them news at all times, and we can't compete with it. No one can. - [Warren] Michael arrived at the hospital 1:31 p.m. after receiving CPR for over an hour. - [Thao] Michael Jackson was lifeless. We moved forward even though we suspected that it was futile. If we call it quit at that time, it would be giving up. It's not a case of too little too late. It seems like a case of too late. - [Warren] The pieces of the puzzle started coming together. He was dead at his house. Conrad Murray refused to pronounce him dead. There was no hope. (soft music) - [Harvey] We knew when we pushed the button that he had died. - [Steven] But we were all glued to our desktops. What information is out there? What's TMZ posting? Somebody's head popped up, and I just heard a voice go, "Michael Jackson's dead!" - [Andy] If you look at TMZ now, they say he's dead. Do we post? Do we post? - [Alan] Here's this website, TMZ, who are really looked at as bottom feeders. That was clearly not reliable enough to be considered a real source, a legit source. - [Warren] We'll never know for sure who TMZ's sources were, but we do know they have a network of people on the ground feeding them inside information. - Joining us now is a news producer - We got multiple sources that had confirmed to us that he had died. - [Mike] We started getting emails, phone calls from all over the world instantly trying to find out what was going on. And one of the main questions we kept hearing was, "Are you sure?" - [Harvey] We checked and double checked and triple checked. We knew that he had died. The L.A. Times came out and said he was in a coma. The media had to make a choice. Do they follow The Times or do they follow TMZ? - Now I just got off the phone with a cardiologist and-- - You know, I'm gonna just interrupt you for a second, Elizabeth, because, CNN sources are now saying that Michael Jackson is in a coma. - What else can you tell me about it? - He didn't say much and he couldn't confirm that those who had been in... - He did or he... - The information that is, um the one, the information we're waiting on... - Unfortunately, there's all these rumors, and it's hard to know what's true. - [Reporter] Have you searched the house? - I've got nothing else for you, guys. - [Reporter] Joining me now for more on Jackson, we have Alan Light. - [Alan] We're live getting different reports. He was dead, that he was dying, that we don't know, that he's in the hospital. Nobody's confirming, nobody's answering. We don't want to be irresponsible, but you don't want to miss the story. What constituted responsibility? What constituted legitimate sourcing? It's evident in that moment that those rules are changing right underneath your feet. The usual standard for confirming a story is you want at least two independent sources to verify the story. In a world of internet journalism, that's a standard that's gotten very compromised. (static buzzing) - President Kennedy died at 1:00 p.m. Central Standard time, two o'clock Eastern Standard time, some 38 minutes ago. - [Harvey] I remember being glued to a television set watching Walter Cronkite, but there wasn't wall-to-wall coverage on television sets back then. - [Warren] Family gathers, they're all together gathered around that box. (beeping) This piece of technology would go to sleep. (static buzzing) And the family would go to sleep, and then you have the television doing something else. - [Reporter] This is CNN breaking news. - [Warren] Programming goes 24 hours. It went from five channels to we can't really even count them. Michael Jackson really grows up with the media. - [Alan] We're seeing a rise in the paparazzi culture, in gossip column coverage, all these shows that were driven by celebrity gossip. - [Reporter] Can't get enough of that Jackson-Presley stuff? We have the latest, and you won't believe it. - [Reporter] We have new details from inside Michael Jackson's divorce papers and what's going to happen to the kids? - [Alan] Which then bleeds into the internet era. The internet and social media entirely transformed our relationship to information, to news of-of any kind, however big or small. In that moment where everybody would turn to CNN to find out the story, that's not necessarily where they're turning right now. They're looking at their phones, they're looking at their screens, their computers. All of this was so new in 2009. It just felt like chaos. - I don't know what to believe right now. I heard he had a heart attack. I heard they brought him back. - [Warren] You see the system break down, 'cause it's never experienced this rush for information that follows the announcement of Michael Jackson's death. - [TMZ Spokesperson] We were the only news outlet reporting that he was dead. Traffic was enormous. - [Alan] Internet news traffic was breaking records. - [Reporter] Word of Michael Jackson's death spread like wildfire across the country. Social media is overwhelmed. - [Warren] He broke the internet. - [Reporter] Google News shut down mistakenly thinking the traffic surge was a virus attack. - I just want to know what's happening. - This coming-- - I have to stop you for a second, AJ. - Go ahead. - Breaking news about Michael Jackson. Now in the past few minutes, The Los Angeles Times and the Associated Press have reported that Jackson has died. - Are you being serious? (speaking off microphone) No. (crying) - We're over here at the medical center, LA. Michael Jackson has died. - There were hundreds of people, gathering steadily over the last few hours, and they have been growing in numbers. There's a lot of media, of course, but what's extraordinary is the amount of members of the public that have been gathering here, people snapping a lot of photos. - [Geoff] You have random people running up to the hospital with their cameras. Whatever they capture at that moment could go up on the internet, and I'm watching the media fighting to report first. - [Man] Michael! - [Woman] Oh my god. - [Warren] Something new is happening. - [Man] All right, right now, me and Jacob are at the UCLA Medical Center. - [Warren] The content that's generated not by news stations, but by people who are out there just chasing. They're running. - [Man] Why are we running? - [Man] Everybody's running. (helicopter whirring) - [Steven] We had graduated from the flip phone into the smartphone era, Blackberrys, iPhones. - [Andy] Everybody's cellphone was becoming like a video production unit. Everybody suddenly is a roving journalist, and that's major. - [Man] They are not there to mourn so much as they are there to share and recirculate information. - [Man] Watch your back, guys. - [Crowd] Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael, -[Crowd] Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael. - [Warren] We're all producers, we're all consumers, and we're just hungry. - [Andy] The guy, who his whole life had no privacy, from childhood to death, he was a man never allowed to be dignified. - [Male Paparazzi] How's the moonwalking going, Michael? -[Female Paparazzi] Do you like the Church Michael? (speaking off microphone) (reporters and paparazzi talking over one another) (camera shutters clicking) (camera shutters clicking) - This is hard, um... my brother, the legendary King of Pop, Michael Jackson, passed away on Thursday, June 25th, 2009 at 2:26 p.m. Our family requests that the media please respect our privacy during this tough time, and may Allah be with you, Michael, always. - [Warren] To officially announce this as a member of the family was almost like just a little gulp of air, a gulp of grief that people did slow down, but it was just for a fragment of a second, really, and then it was back to more. - [Crowd] Michael, Michael. - [Warren] The authorities were concerned that transporting Michael's body to the coroner's office by road would lead to pandemonium. The only way to get his body out (helicopter whirring) was by helicopter. - [Andy] The casket going to the morgue was watched by the entire planet all tuned in. We both condemn it and we look. - [Jermaine] I rushed across town, and once I got close to UCLA, I saw the helicopters in the sky. I said, "That's where he is." - [Pilot] Yep, I got him. Go to the left, get as much as we can. - [Warren] When this crushing fame his whole life has finally just killed him, he's still being stalked by those cameras. (gentle music) -[Pilot] we have a shot up to your left it's open right now. - [Pilot] There you go. - [Warren] Even in death, He doesn't get a moment's privacy. (gentle music) - [Steven] When Elvis died, it was a really simple way to process someone's death. - [Brian] When John Lennon died, people had to gather physically. There was this feeling of collective mourning. People did that with Michael, but you could also gather online. - [Toure] It gives you more people to mourn with. It becomes this sort of virtual wake. - We should learn by example. He's definitely a teacher. So, I'm done crying for tonight. Peace, guys. - [Warren] How you mourned Michael Jackson is more of a reflection of you as an individual than us as a society because it was across the board different. - [Hua] It was most deeply felt by people who didn't grow up on the internet. It tapped into a kind of nostalgia for a time when popular culture just seemed much simpler, but much grander, too. - [Toure] We saw Michael from a little kid to a young man, having children and becoming older man. This is the death of a person who has been part of your life for decades. You have a relationship with them. It matters. It becomes part of your family. - I was raised off of his music. If you said something bad about Michael in my house, you was in trouble. - They looked just like me back when they debuted. They all had 'fro. - [Danyel] He was similar to my age, and he was black. It was astonishing. What was there really that was so reflective of me? On television, not so much, but man, I could listen to him sing and look at the pictures of him. I could feel like something representing me was out there. It's someone you had since childhood, and you just felt like he was always going to be there. - It hurts, because it's like someone all my life, the Jackson Family, the Jackson 5. - [Andy] They remember being young, they remembered a more innocent time in their own life that's gone forever, the same as Michael. It's a yearning for their own past. - He was a hero for me as I was growing up. - [Warren] This giant was now dead. It was like a part of them that died. This beautiful man came and gave us so much music. - [Reporter] Record stores have had a hard time keeping Michael Jackson music on the shelves. - [Store Rep] We were sold out within about an hour and a half after his death. - [Store Rep] We sold every CD we had in the store. Records, vinyl, memorabilia, videos. We're out of everything. - Madame Speaker, we would ask members to please stand for a moment of silence. (solemn music) - [Warren] There was no bigger star in the world than Michael Jackson. You could go to any corner of the universe. You could go to any continent. - As a pop star, he's always been my inspiration ever since I was a small boy. - [Maria] We were all crying together as a people. We can relate, even if we don't speak the same language. - [Reporter] They came here initially to mourn, but then it began to be a celebration. - [Crowd] Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson! - [Danyel] It was the saddest day, but music, that's the purity, that's the joy. - [Warren] It had new meaning and purpose now that he wasn't here anymore. It became much more powerful. - [Maria] We're all very different people sharing the same feeling. - [Crowd] Michael, Michael, Michael! - [Maria] And without words, we were able to understand what the other person felt. (crowd chanting) His death made me revisit my life. - [Reporter] As throngs of fans worldwide continue to mourn the loss of Michael Jackson, the family is still working on plans for the funeral for the King of Pop. - It is the family's wish to create a service and a celebration that all of Michael's fans around the world can be part of. - The thought of trying to pull all of this together by Friday seems to be difficult at best. - [Reporter] Work is underway at the Staples Center in Los Angeles for Michael Jackson's memorial. More than a million and a half people have registered to win the 17,500 tickets for the Tuesday event. - [Reporter] So many people scrambled to get tickets that the website offering them simply crashed. It seems a little bit more like a rock concert. - [Reporter] Police are bracing for a massive onslaught, up to 700,000 people. - [Reporter] This could be a very, very expensive deployment of public safety personnel. - [Travis] No one could have imagined being tasked mounting this globally televised memorial. It was, and still remains, one of the most surreal moments of my life. Our rehearsals took on a different purpose. Our focus shifted. The job then now became to mount the memorial service, and so it just kinda rolled right into that. - [Reporter] Toure is in Los Angeles. He is an NBC contributor who also writes for Rolling Stone Magazine. - So you have to put him at the top, certainly the greatest of his generation. (crowd chanting) Michael, Michael, Michael... I covered the memorial outside the Staples Center for MSNBC, seven straight hours of coverage. I just saw the magnitude of this moment. - [Jermaine] We lost our brother, our hero. The world is mourning, we're mourning, the fans are mourning. It's unreal, it's unbelievable. - [Reporter] Now before Michael Jackson is buried here, his body goes downtown to the big tribute at the Staples Center. - [Toure] Of course the Michael Jackson end has to become a circus because his life has been a circus. (crowd cheering and yelling) (instrumental circus music) - [Pilot] That's what I want right there. - [Reporter] Limousines, private cars, 37 in all, with a huge police escort, all going along the freeways here of Los Angeles to the tribute downtown, and Michael Jackson, once again, is delivered to his public. - [Reporter] There's a lot of energy out here, a lot of people very excited to simply be a part of this day in history. - This is not just an LA event, and not just an American event. It's a very much a worldwide wake. It's being carried live right across the planet. It's likely to be the biggest memorial service the world, in fact, has ever seen. (speaking in Chinese) -[Reporter] In the heart of Harlem, about a block away from the Apollo Theater, where Michael Jackson burst onto the music scene, thousands gathered, a steady stream of folks who are standing before this jumbotron enwrapped, watching what is taking place in Los Angeles. - [Reporter] Quite a crowd that is amassing here in front of the gates of Neverland. We have quite a few vendors who are here, as well. They're selling everything from these Michael Jackson t-shirts, to hats, to buttons, lemonade, water, you name it. There are quite a few entrepreneurs here. The fans that I talked to really feel closer to Michael Jackson here. - [Brian] Michael ended up on a stage again with his brothers. They managed to reunite one more time. - [Andy] Last stage that he was on became the stage of his funeral. - [Warren] Michael Jackson comes in as an entertainer, he goes out as an entertainer. - [Steven] Let's let him finish and leave this earth with one last big show. (crowd cheering and applauding) - [Alan] The memorial for Michael was arranged as a performance. It was an event. It was shot the way you would film an awards show. There was an entertainment aspect that was above and beyond a memorial service. (crowd applauding) - We were here. We were right here, a little less than a week ago, and Michael was with us. We knew we had to invite the world to join us here at Michael's house. (crowd cheering) - [Travis] I have to believe everything happens for a reason, and that he is in a better place, and not suffering, and able to be remembered for his songs that spoke to people globally. -[Rev. Sharpton] All over the world today, people are gathered in love vigils to celebrate the life of a man that taught the world how to love. It was Michael Jackson that brought blacks, and whites, and Asians, and Latinos together. It was Michael Jackson that made us sing We Are The World. Michael made us love each other. Michael taught us to stand with each other. I want his three children to know, there wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with. (crowd cheering and applauding) - [Warren] At the end of the memorial, Michael Jackson's children come out. - [Travis] The moment is seared into my memory. (crowd cheering) - I just wanted to say - Speak up, sweetheart, speak up. Get close. - Ever since I was born, daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine. And I just wanted to say I love him so much. (applauding) - [Warren] It's then that we really realize all that we didn't allow Michael Jackson to be. It becomes our shame in what we have done to reduce this individual to one thing, man on stage. (soft music) We were left with a culture that we somehow knew had changed. There's this heightened awareness that we were all deep in the labyrinth of images and information and that now, more than ever, we would need those gaps where humanity comes through. The final curtain call shows for Michael Jackson are really the strangest shows in the history of popular music, because there's so much pressure on Michael Jackson to be the star that we asked him to be. He's telling us this is gonna be the final set of shows. This is gonna be a culmination. It's gonna be big. He's taking on and saying that he's gonna top himself and go out, you know, at that peak. And really, his death is the thing that makes it the most perfect ending. He was right. He did not fail. That final curtain call was the biggest show.
