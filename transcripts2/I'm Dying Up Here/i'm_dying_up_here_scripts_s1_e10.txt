 [Bill] Previously on I'm Dying Up Here... A well-fitted shoulder lies flat! - That motherfucker. - That's your joke. I want you to write more stuff for me. This club is the only runway to Carson. One thing's a little clearer-- I'm not funny anymore. Whatever, nigga. You don't ever get to call me that. - [Goldie] What are you? - Excuse me? I have no idea what the fuck you are. You're gonna be on TV. That's huge, man.

 You could be headlining at King Theodore's. [Ron] You were in the trades? "Girls Are Funny Too" was announced. [Goldie] Cut the stand-up? Stand-up is what this show is about. You're fired, Goldie. ♪ Edwin Starr's "War" ♪ ♪ War, huh ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ What is it good for? ♪ ♪ Absolutely nothing ♪ ♪ Uh-huh, uh-huh ♪ ♪ War, huh ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪

 ♪ What is it good for? ♪ Edgar, ten bucks. You're gonna jump ship for ten bucks? Gabe is going up six nights a week. That's 60 bucks, cash. - [Sully] That's Gabe. - [Bill] Gabe's a hack. [Edgar] Yeah, plus, Mitch is showing up now. Something else about Teddy's-- that motherfucker Barton Royce is over there. Man is no good. [Edgar] If enough of us go up, what's she gonna do? She's got to let us play both clubs eventually. [Sully] And--and--and she has to pay. [Nick] A few defections, and you think suddenly Goldie's just gonna drop to her knees? Comics from all over the country come here to Los Angeles to go up at Goldie's. - Every day. - I hate to burst your bubble, but we're just funny widgets. [Edgar] Fuck the money. Mitch at King Theodore's is a game changer. It's not a monopoly anymore. Yeah, but nobody from Teddy's has been picked to go up on Carson. - [Sully] And it only takes one! - [sniffs] [Bill] And you're not the one, Sully. - [laughter] - [sniffs] Truth be told, it's not like anybody from Goldie's has been on Carson in a while neither. ♪♪ [women imitating sheep bleating] [Cassie gasps] Oh. There you are. How many times have I told you girls about curfew? [Cassie] This is Hollywood. [sighs] There are wolves everywhere. Oh, God. - [Marty] What the hell? - Don't let me stop you. - Aw, come on. - Marty, Marty. - [man] Cut. - This is not the time or place. Marty, let me, will you, please? [Marty] No, we shoot in less than a week. Really? You want to burn the television bridge? This is suicide, and you know it. Beats a lynching. Get out of my way, Eli. My God, this is worse than I thought. How ridiculous do you feel, huh? Honestly, have-- have they even told you? I have been fired. Hmm? They said you were consulting. Oh, was that the word these cowards used? No, fired. They got rid of me so that they could manipulate you without anybody here to protect you. Goldie, that's exactly why we fired you, so that we could manipulate these girls into the opportunity of a lifetime. I was tossing and turning all night long. I woke up this morning, and I realized my best female comics that-- Do they even let you do any stand-up, Elayne? One line of stand-up? Nothing? Anywhere? [chuckles] How does this prove we are as funny as men? All this proves is we are the fucking sheep they think we are. This is the opportunity of a lifetime he's talking about. Come on, girls, we'll come back to Goldie's. We'll do some real fucking humor. Come on! [Marty] Stay right there! Goldie, we've got a contract. We will sue your ass! So sue me. You got my lawyer standing right-- - [Eli] Oh, jeez. - [woman] Is she okay? - Get the fuck away from me. - Fuck this. God-- - Goldie, are you okay? - [Goldie] God-- - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Come on, girls. Come on, let's go. [Goldie] God damn it. [man] Take 15, everybody. [Marty] Where's that tall one? Where's the tall one? You. You should be up there. [Goldie] Fucking morons. That's what you get for working with people don't know what the fuck they're doing. For Christ's sake. [sighs] Jesus. They have no idea what we're trying to do. Isn't this what we're trying to do? You, Carson, isn't it all so we can get to this? If by "this," you mean this idiotic outfit and doing so-called comedy you don't believe in. Goldie, they're giving me more money than I've ever seen in my entire life while putting me in front of millions of people. You brought me here, you changed my act, and you told me that this was my ticket. Now you got fired, and... I'm supposed to follow you again? Where? Where are you going? Well, there's one way to find out. Hmm? ♪ somber music ♪ [scoffs] ♪♪ [man] That looks great. So, a friend of mine from back east recently graduated from, uh, barber college. Barber college. [laughter] Now, isn't that just a little pretentious? I mean, even doctors only go to med school, but somehow a one-year course on how to cut hair requires the word "college" after it, right? - [laughs] - Like, the degree of difficulty between a shag haircut and open heart surgery is just that much more. - I know, the only thing the two have in common are high instances of malpractice. Ha ha! Shim sham! All right, everybody, this is Kenny in the AM, and we're gonna be right back with comedian Gabe Schwartz. Now, listen up. He's gonna be performing all week long at King Theodore's, so check him out. But first, a little help with your morning commute from The Pretenders-- "A Broken Heart"... Wah, wah! "Cries." Funny bit, that barber thing. [both] Oh, thank you. ♪ Songs about the changing of the world ♪ What? It's a secret? I'm sitting here with a pad and a pencil. ♪ Baby, it's growing ♪ ♪ Just where it starts ♪ Okay, Maestro. Eva Gabor's getting divorced.

Climbed up the spout again! [sighs] [laughter] It's a little light. Few more defections. [scoffs] Fuck. Promote, uh, Abel... Howe, or Lindsey up from the Cellar. They're--they're-- they're ready. [sniffs] Abel and Lindsey are, uh... working Teddy's. They still want to go up here, but we all know your policy on working clubs in the same zip code. I could bring up Adam. He's doing...all right. I am not rushing him to fix a leak in the lineup. Ungrateful bastards. [chuckling] They're willing to blow off Johnny Carson for ten bucks a set. - Yeah. - Ten bucks. [sighs] Uh, I guess... a lot of 'em don't see it that way. Exactly how do they see it? That you haven't had a guy on Carson since Clay. And that maybe now there are other ways to, you know, get there. What do you mean, Mitch? [laughs] Trust me, he's just window dressing over there. Shut the door behind you. [applause and wild laughter] I've been working on my look, because in Hollywood, we all know that's what's most important. So I think we can all agree that my look is synonymous with one thing. Say it with me--bad boy. - [laughter] - Yeah, this collection is actually my, uh, "don't mess with me" sweater. Full house, my man, just like I promised. - I've had 'em before. - Oh, by the way, all the electricals are up to fire code-- passed with flying colors. You fixed the wiring? No. Good work, Barton. [both laughing] [doorbell rings] [Billie Holiday's "God Bless the Child" playing] ♪ Mama may have ♪ Bar's open. Pour you one? Thanks, I know my way around. ♪ But God bless the child that's got his own ♪ ♪♪ ♪ That's got his own-- ♪ Cheery. She had 70 cents in her bank account when she died. Screwed at every turn. Ah, the fuckers. [sniffs] - Goldie. - Eh? Word's out about you and "Girls Are Funny Too." Yeah? And what's that word? Well, that's why I'm here. You tell me what to say, and that's what you'll read in tomorrow's Reporter. CBS is saying "creative differences." [sighs, chuckles] There's nothing about creativity. It's all about commerce and compromise. They should all be taken out and shot like gutter rats. Okay. Now... why don't you tell me... what you want me to print? [sighs] ♪ dramatic music ♪ ♪♪ They ruined it. They took an original idea and covered it in bright lights and sucked all the originality out of it. Karen Cozwell-- she's funnier than shit. She didn't make the cut because she wasn't pretty enough. It's-- [scoffs] They chose style over substance, looks over funny, and crushed it from a fucking belly laugh into a sideways grin. If the people in charge of television were in charge of medicine, we'd all be dead from fucking syphilis. Now that we've got that out of our system... Friend to friend, what do you want me to print? Friend to friend? Every fucking word. "Hired only as a pretty face"? That's all Goldie thinks I am? And...we're back. Today I have a special guest. You've seen him at Goldie's on the Strip. He's a very, very funny man, Mr. Bill Hobbs! Oh, it's great to be here, Kenny, at the ungodly hour of seven in the morning. [laughs] I've been here since 4:30, so shut up! Now, Bill, last time I saw you I was in a fetal position while you kicked me. Yeah, and I was punching you in that big, doughy face of yours. Ha ha ha! Been kicking and punching anybody interesting lately, huh? Anybody we've heard of? No, not lately. All my exercise has come from being a pallbearer, Kenny. Sadly, my father passed away recently--heart attack. I'm--I'm sorry to hear that, Bill. Ah, thanks, I appreciate that, but I got to tell you, being a pallbearer is a great workout. You know, people thought that I was crying, but I was actually sweating profusely. And just so people know the difference, you don't usually grunt when you cry. I didn't really get cremation, Kenny, until I had to haul my father's body up a hill to his plot. I did lose my dad, but, uh, I also lost five pounds. Ho ho. I'm sorry to hear that. But you know what? Great note for me. My dad's a solid 365. I'm gonna keep that in mind. Listen, we're gonna be back with the master of dark, comedian Bill Hobbs, right after sports and weather. Hey, Billy, what do you say we take a few calls when we come back? I say let's do it, preferably obscene. - Obscene it is, on Kenny in the AM. All right, I got to take a leak. Hey, grab us a couple coffees. Me? Coffees? You're a waiter. Is it that big of a stretch? Milk, two sugars. [Kenny] Fuck. [door closes] [groans] [note pad thuds] [clears throat] Coffee? I'm good. Cool. Bill? Sorry about your dad. Thanks, man. [door opens] [door closes] [indistinct chatter] [Nick clears throat] Thanks for coming. Mm. Never too proud for sloppy seconds. [inhales sharply] So, seriously... you and super agent Brenner? Let's just say it was a... mutual parting of the ways. [chuckles] "Mutual"? - Yeah. - Mm. [laughs] Nick, this town's only big in square miles. In reputations, it's slightly fucking smaller than a postage stamp, man. Why the fuck ask? - You know why I'm here Nick? - [clears throat] Huh? Fear and desperation. Yeah. Comic's cocktail of choice, man, seriously. Every day you know that you grow less special, and I fucking love that. I love that, because I can sell that guy, huh? 'Cause that guy? That guy'll fucking listen. That guy'll do whatever the fuck it takes to stay in the game, man. So let's face it... where else he got to go? Right? [crunching ice] It's why we're here. Good. Well, let me see what I can dig up. Oh, in the meantime, lose the badass bullshit, okay? [inhales sharply] Seriously... it's a fucking buyer's market out there, Nick. I'll call you. [Goldie] Next Monday? I tell you I need 30 pounds of frozen drumsticks by the weekend, and you are telling me next fucking Monday? Oh, fuck. [Goldie] Yeah, yeah, yeah, bullshit! Are you listening, Peter? Does anybody in this fucking town listen? Peter, I am all alone here, all right? Alone. Everything falls on my fucking shoulders. So, if you want to help, here's what I need-- reciprocity, a fucking sliver of the loyalty that I have shown you over the fucking years! Not in word, in deed. You get me those goddamn drumsticks! [receiver slams] [laughter] Hey, listen, it's nothing wrong with still being a virgin after 20, all right? [laughter] But I do love living in L.A., though. I do. Don't get me wrong, okay? It's beautiful. The weather's perfect, the women are--mmm, yes. [crowd cheering] And--and all the tourists are thoroughly convinced that I'm that one black guy from that thing. I'm--I'm serious. In here, I'm just Adam Proteau. But out on Hollywood Boulevard, oh, I'm Sidney Poitier. [laughter] [Adam] I'm Ben Vereen, Richard Roundtree, Harry Belafonte. The one I don't understand though is--is Lena Horne. - I don't-- - [laughter] Wait. Do y'all see it? [cheers and applause] What if I-- [cheers and applause continue] [Adam] He's like, "I see it! I see it!" [laughter] Now, my stepdad's name was Parnell. Now, it ain't a man alive named Parnell that's not an asshole. [laughter] [Adam] Even the white ones are bad. Get the fuck offstage. That's right, Parnell used to be in a bad mood about every fucking thing, even Christmas. How the fuck are you mad at Christmas? Oh, so what you're telling me is Baby Jesus got frankincense, myrrh, and gold for His birthday when He was born? Shit, all I got was a smack on my black ass when I was born. [laughter and applause] [Adam] Didn't even give me a birth certificate. All I got was titty milk and a name tag. [laughter] And my name was spelled wrong. Who the fuck is Darnell? But it wasn't just Christmas. It wasn't just Christmas and Santa Claus, all right? It was also the Tooth Fairy. Now, all of my friends would get coins from the Tooth Fairy when they put a tooth under they pillow. I put a tooth under my pillow, I ain't get shit. Seriously, and I would try to complain... complain to Parnell-- "Hey, the Tooth Fairy didn't leave me shit under my pillow." His response was, "Look, the Tooth Fairy gave you a roof over you head and three square meals." [unamplified] If you don't want to lose another one, you gonna get-- [cheers and applause] And that's just how it goes. Matter of fact, Parnell, ladies and gentlemen. Adam Proteau! This bitch right here-- - [cheers and applause] - Adam Proteau. Ha ha. Fucking dickhead. [cheers and applause] Friends, Romans, lady right there-- you with them big-ass titties, lend me your ears! Hey! Adam, what the fuck do you think you're doing? I'm putting it to a vote. [cheers and applause] Hey, your time is up, get the fuck down from there. - Is it, Ralph? - It's over. [crowd booing] So let's take it to a vote! This is America, right? - [cheers and applause] - Yeah. Okay. Now, should I continue? [loud cheers and applause] Or--or--or-- this is a democracy-- should we give Ralph back his stage? [crowd booing] - [Arnie] Ralph, calm down. - Where the fuck have you been? You see what's happening in here right now? I ain't never seen nobody pull some fucking bullshit like this motherfucker just pulled. Ralph, shut the fuck up, okay? Shush! - Make me shut the fuck up. - You mad? - Why--why would I stop? - Come on. They was loving me in there. Why would you stop that? It don't give you the right to run the fucking light. What do you mean run the light? You know how many comics I done seen run the light? - Those motherfuckers earned it. - Not five minutes. - Not ten minutes. - They earned it. - Not--they didn't earn shit! - They earned it! I don't understand. Whatever, dog. You sound like a fucking broken-ass record. You need to listen to this broken-ass record! Fuck your broken-ass record. How about-- Earn some shit, motherfucker. How about that? How about you just tell us what's really pissing you off? Oh, tell us, then. Tell us what's pissing you off. - Tell us, motherfucker. - You mad 'cause I'm passing your old ass, and it's really pissing you off 'cause all that's over my head is blue skies. Only thing you got over yours is this fucking ceiling. - Motherfucker, I'll-- - Hey, hey, hey, hey! No! No! No! You're fucking both pissing me off! No fighting in the Cellar stairwell! You're fucking banned for a week! Fuck you, Arnie! You ain't Goldie! I am tonight! Look, I know you got to have your King Kong moment up there. - My what? - What the fuck, Arnie? Choose your motherfucking words more carefully, man. Listen, I think we all know that I mean when he climbed the balcony, it was kind of like King Kong climbing the Empire State building, okay? It's a good fucking analogy. Shut up. Shut-- Arnie, shut the fuck up. Shut up, shut up! Okay, Goldie gave me extra time in the Cellar. Yeah, 30 minutes, not 40. How about we go talk to her about it, then, huh? She doesn't want to talk to you, man. You may think you're the center of the universe, but you're sorely mistaken. You know what? Fuck both of y'all. Take your punishment like a man, pussy. I'm taking my punishment... right the fuck out of this place. "The doorbell rings. Angie goes to answer it. When she does, Benny enters with a letter and hands it to her. He's still nervous, but nothing like he was on his first day." "I thought you might be waiting for this, so I wanted to hand-deliver it to you personally, because I am all about taking care of the people on my route." "Mm-hmm. You've got to use the bathroom again, don't you, Benny?" "What? No-- What gave it away?" [laughter] "Your hand-delivered letter, it's a circular from Lamps, Lamps, Lamps." [laughter] "Yeah, but they're 20 percent off, and if I'm being honest, a little more light in here wouldn't hurt." [laughter] "Benny, is this gonna be a regular thing? You've been on this route a week, and you've already used our bathroom four times." "It's not my fault. It's Mrs. Wilmore. She keeps giving me food to-go, and trust me, when she says it's to-go, she ain't kidding." [laughter] "And as Benny hurries toward the bathroom, he suddenly pauses."

Well, Roni Baloney, it's called Kenny in the AM, not Kenny and Company in the AM. [Ron] Right, that's funny, though, because, you know, I happen to know for a fact that all your material is written by Eddie Zeidel, who's a regular at Goldie's on Mondays and Donimirski's Polish Deli in the Valley on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so, you know, if anybody wants to see the fist inside the puppet, you should really go see Eddie Zeidel-- Okay, sorry about that, everybody, we get some...

[heavy rock music playing] [Kenny moaning in pain] [woman] Think we should go in there? You wanted to see me? [Goldie] Yeah. You need to be over in Burbank in an hour. [scoffs] Why Burbank? You got The Tonight Show... tomorrow night. They want you to come by, run through the material. Wha-- Franklyn Ajaye got a cold, Mitch called, they needed a replacement, so I told them you were ready. Jesus Christ. ♪ sentimental music ♪ Congratulations, Bill.

I got to say, that was really exciting. Well, you were incredible. Really? I couldn't tell. The whole thing feels sort of like a blur. [laughs] Welcome to television. So what's next? Pardon? You know, now that this is over, what are you gonna do next? I'm sure you'll have hundreds of options. [Ralph] Are you sure we should be celebrating this early? You still have 15 hours to fuck this up. [laughter] - Hey-- - Hey, listen, unless I get bumped 'cause Carol Channing's fucking limp eats up all my time, I will be sitting on Johnny's couch tomorrow tonight laughing with the man. - [laughter] - Ha ha, man, you're not getting the fucking couch. The only way you will get the couch is if The Tonight Show has a yard sale. Please. [laughter] [indistinct chatter] Hey, Walter. What's up, man? I want to go up. Come on, Al's the last comic, and it's lights out. Look, man, I don't care if it's just me and the cockroaches. I need to go up. [sighs] [clicks tongue] All right, man. [Al] Nicer car-- I just don't understand it. Why would she leave me? [Edgar] At least you get to wear that fucking suit. Oh, shit, look who it is! [Bill] Huh? Oh. [Ralph] That's what a TV star look like. - Hey! - Come over here, girl. [Edgar] Grandpa-size set of balls, I will tell you that. [Sully] Wow. [Ralph] What's why we love her. - [Ralph laughs] - [Edgar] Jesus Christ. Congratulations. Oh, thanks. I tried to call you, but-- Yeah, I was over at "Girls are Fucking Idiots Too." Oh, it's a documentary now? - Oh, yeah, you heard? - [laughter] Let's celebrate her. Some real TV cred. [scattered applause] All right, all right, I know it's 2 a.m. and it's late, but we've got one more comic coming to the stage. So make some noise for Nick Beverly. [scattered applause] Good morning. - [Ralph] No. - [Cassie] What is he doing? - [Ralph] Fucking Nick. - [Edgar] Look out. - [Ralph] Showing up at 2 a.m. - [Nick] All right. Got the cream of the crop, huh? 2 a.m. This is "Confessions of a Junkie." Oh, shit. That's right. I'm a junkie. Been clean about a month now. "Clean's" kind of a relative term, 'cause now I'm doing methadone. Going from heroin to methadone is like going from fucking Raquel Welch to fucking a jar of peanut butter with her face drawn on it. [laughter] When you're a junkie, man, your priorities, they just get all out of whack. You know, they're fucked. You'd do anything for that fix. I remember one Mother's Day. My gift to my mom was just to steal something small from her. - [scattered laughter] - You know, five dollars or less, 'cause she's my mom. It's her special day.

Yeah. You scared? Shitless. But it's a dry shitless. Mm. - Good? - [man] Here you go. - Thanks. - [man] Have a good one. Ahh. Suck it in, Sull. You'll never be here. - Thank you so much. - [laughs] Listen up! Show of hands-- how many people want to see Bill fail tonight?

[Maggie] Guys, we have work to do in here. Yes, you have to take your little party to the Cellar. All right, you heard the pretty lady, to the Cellar. All right. Tonight's on Ron!

Oh, social call, then? Ah, something like that. Look, I'm gonna talk, you gonna listen, and then I'm gonna leave. Cool? When I was your age, I joined the military. Was gonna be a career man. Then the war broke out, and they shipped my ass off to 'Nam. Did two tours, saw all kinds of shit, but the one thing that I saw over and over again were kids put into situations they had no idea how to handle. What, you saying this 'cause you feel like I ain't ready? We still in the "you listening" part, you dig? ♪♪ There are people--and they were just kids back then-- in places right now 'cause of me. Homes, jobs, families. I'm proud of that. I took care of them. I saw them through. ♪♪ Then there are kids in places because of me... I'm not so proud of. What, like, graves and shit? Yeah, graves and shit... and here. ♪♪ Can I tell you something I ain't never told nobody else? Of course. Man, I'm only 17 years old. You're shitting me. No, I'm serious. I took my--my stepdad's Eldorado after my mom passed, and I drove to L.A. Slept in it, met Carl, sold it. Damn. ♪♪ Look, man, I didn't mean that ceiling shit that I said the other night. - That was just me being mad. - [scoffs] I know. [scoffs] It's too bad that shit is true. You got a God-given gift. You gonna be big, Adam, real big. I mean, most of us... [scoffs] These motherfuckers, we gonna be climbing and climbing... till we just hanging by our fingertips. We gonna need somebody to stomp on 'em before we see the light. - [laughs] - You know what I'm saying? - [laughs] - Yeah. Well, well, well... You thinking about coming over, too, Ralph? Look... you take care of yourself, you hear me? Yeah. Think about it. It would be an honor to have a prominent nigger like yourself grace up our stage. You said that word like you were white. Maybe because when I'm talking to you, I mean it like I'm white. [Ralph chuckles] ♪♪ [band playing "The Tonight Show Theme"] ♪♪ [indistinct chatter] [woman] Oh, my God.

And, uh, I didn't know the answer then. But... I do now. I'm all ears. I am whatever it takes. [scoffs] Is that supposed to wow me? Goldie, you... [groans] ...got your pound of flesh in the trades. What more do you need? You come in here all swagger and cigarette smoke when one good breeze would knock you on your ass. Oh, because you're the only tough one? [sighs] What do you want, Cass? Hmm? I want to go back up here... on your stage. Like nothing happened? No. Like a lot happened. [lighter clinks, clicks] [lighter clinks, thuds on desk] [exhales deeply] Okay.

Like, what are you thinking when you're standing up there? [sighs] Truthfully? Yeah. How I wish my dad was there. I know. You'd think, after what he did, how we were always at each other's throats-- but I swear to God, Sull... ...it was the happiest moment of my life, and more than anything, I wanted to share it with the person who couldn't have cared less.
