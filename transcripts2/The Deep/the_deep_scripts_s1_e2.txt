 No... it can't be. Life boats, now! What is it?? They don't exist! They can't. Huagghh! Oh no! [Pants] Captain. What was that? Somethin' impossible. A myth....The Dark Orca... My family are explorers.

 We have been for generations. While others look up to the stars... ...we know there are an infinite number of things that shine in the darkness below. There are things lurking in the seas that long ago vanished into myth. My family are explorers. And we explore... THE DEEP! "...the stolen salvage vessel was searching for a Dutch Trader sunk in the seventeenth century. (not listening) Uh huh. It was carrying a fortune in gilders when it was pulled into the sea by giant grappling hooks..." That sounds great. Huh? ...the salvage vessel was last seen orbiting the earth being towed by martians singing "Jingle Bells". Yep. I'll get to it tomorrow. Will?! Huh? What? Look, I know finding this scroll was important-- Important? This could be the key to lost Lemuria, Kaiko. This is what my parents were searching for. "Important" doesn't quite cover it. I brought you another coffee, Dad. Thanks, Fontaine! Just put it over there. You mean with all the other coffees you haven't drunk? Agh! Still no match! What are you trying to match? This looks like an ancient map but it doesn't match any modern topography. What do these symbols mean? I'm not sure. A location maybe? But they're in a lost language. No-one alive today can read them. There's one person who might be able to... Dolos. Dolos?! As in, 'mysterious keeper of information' Dolos? Yes. I finally get to see the Floating Black Market?! I'll get Jeffrey! It's a floating market, Ant. As in, above water. Your fish doesn't do 'above water'. He does now! TA DA! Ant? You invented this? That's fantastic! Thanks. I call it... ...the Jorange! Why? Because I wanted to invent two things at once, so I invented a fish backpack, AND the first word to rhyme with orange. No... Why would you want to carry a fish everywhere? It's not about what I want, Fontaine. It's about Jeffrey. It's not fair that he's excluded just because we do things out of water. He's a fish. And that means a little thing like 'oxygen' should stop him from being with us? Yep. That's exactly what that means. So, this is a swap. I get your turn driving the Jet Boat next time, right? No. This counts as your turn. It's not my fault you can't drive and wear your fishpack. Backpack development log: Remember to adapt so that I can drive Jet Boat. Fontaine's development log: Remember to make fun of Ant for having a 'backpack development log'. Now remember, you two, we need to keep a low profile. This floating market is... (sing song/unison) ... full of thieves and pirates. Trust no one. Can we trust this Dolos person? (Both): No! I've only scanned the symbols for him to translate. I don't want Dolos getting any hint that the scroll exists. Seventeenth Century Dutch treasure, only discovered a few days ago! Get your gilders here! Absolutely priceless artifacts, for a price! Aggghhh! Huggh! You Lowlives! My grandmother is worth twice that much! Even with her wooden leg! Oooh! What do we have here? This? This is the Jorange! Ant. Low profile. Interesting. I'll take it and the fish. How much do you want? Ah, it's a prototype. It isn't for sale yet. Also, the fish is very special. Oooh! How special? I'd say Jeffrey is the most important fish in the world. The most important fish in the world? Give it to me. Hey! You don't want to do that. Really? And who are you? My name is William Nekton. The Nekton family. Right. You've been known to make things difficult for... uh... legitimate businessmen like myself. Hehe.. Walk away. (backing away) Happy to. Happy to. Find out what they're doing here... now. This Dolos guy creeps me out. Hmmm, Ahaaa Children. All those happy years of sleepless nights and dirty diapers. Such a blessing. Let's keep this short. We're only here so you can translate some symbols. Oh. Anything for old college friends... You went to college with my parents? And you taught it to speak, the blessings are endless. Do you mean that sincerely? You're kind of hard to read... you have a really strange face. It speaks once more, I double my fee. Hmm. No, I don't... I only recognize two of these. Maybe ten thousand years old. Mesopotamian... or... no. This is something else... where did you get these, William? You're getting paid, and that's all you're getting. Hmm, I think this one means entrance, or... no, "gateway". And the other? Ah. This literally means "wet fire". Lava! That means lava! Hah! So obvious. So, he doubled the fee. Take it out of my pocket-money. You don't get that much pocket money. Our Captain would like a word. Oh I thought we already had a word. This time... ..We brought friends. What's the strategy here, Dad? Bargain? Bluff? Outthink them? We RUN! [pants] [pants] What are you doing?! Keep going. Hide. We'll draw them away. We're not gonna leave you! Yes, you are, Fontaine. Don't look back! Ant, if anyone follows you, feel free to do all the inventive things you usually wouldn't be allowed to do. Done! Argh!! Dolos. Dahh! Captain Hammerhead! My favourite pirate. [growls] What'd the Nektons want? Oh, I couldn't possibly betray the confidence of my old college friends. [growls] Ahhh. What would you like to know? Over there! What is that? It's a diversion. Huh? No! Agggghhhh! Huaghh! Haha! Backpack development log. Jeffrey makes an excellent diversion. Ant. Come on! A "gateway"? and "Lava"? I thought you'd be more useful than this, Dolos. You don't want to join the list of people who've disappointed me. Heh! There's more. The Nektons were holding something back. I'm guessing this gateway leads to an ancient treasure. See. Now you're being useful. What sort of Treasure? Something of enormous value, I'm sure. However, the only clue to the location is the volcanic activity. Y-You'd have to follow the Nektons to learn more. I won't have to follow them. I should have them already... I think we lost them. Nope. Where are you going? I have an idea! Now we need to find Mom and Dad... Stop the boat. Ant. Kill the engines. The Captain is waiting for you. I don't want to have to do this the hard way. [beep] Then... ...We'll make it easy for you. We're leaving. No!! I'll take that treasure, and I'll take that fancy sub of theirs for my fleet. We're underway. It would be good to know where we're underway to. Do you know how many volcanic sites there are in the world? [sighs] Would you like another coffee you won't drink? And if this "gateway" is near volcanic activity, it could be buried by now. Didn't Dolos say those symbols were 10,000 years old? Yes. Well, wasn't there an ice age around then? The sea level would-- ...have been much lower than today! A match! The location in the scroll is now underwater, near the Aleutian Islands and they're volcanic. Ant, you're a genius! Did you hear that, Fontaine? Fontaine's development log. Find ways to deflate Ant's expanding head. I can have us there by morning. That long? We could get there faster, but the teleporter's on the fritz. Rover this is Aronnax. We don't need thermal imaging. There's volcanic activity everywhere! Setting GPS co-ordinates for the gateway. Or at least, where I'm hoping some sort of gateway will be. Ugh. They went without me? Mom and dad were never taking you out there with that much heat. And besides, you were too busy playing with your fish backpack. It's called the Jorange and it's not playing. Let's find this gateway and get out of here. According to the GPS, we should be close. Look, what's that? Incredible. This gateway must be 10 metres high. An archway that impressive has to lead somewhere cool. Taking us in to find out. It's... empty. Will? Kids? Are you seeing this? Yeeeah! Ant? I think he's speechless. Ooh, ooh! I'll get a photo, so you can see what Ant looks like when he's not talking. It may never happen again... Huh? Hmm. What's wrong? I don't know. I thought I saw... something on the external cameras. What sort of something? There's nothing on the radar. Or sonar. Kids? Is everything okay? Fontaine's seeing things that aren't there. I'm not a doctor but it sounds like she might need whole new head. There's something under us! Something HUGE! Whoa!! They're going to pin us down! Aronnax secured! Enter the vessel! Rover! Rover!! This is Aronnax. We're under attack!!! We're coming!! Whoever they are. They're coming!! Shut the Moon Pool! No. Wait! We have to cut ourselves free ! Jeffrey stay. Backpack development log: find way to carry Jorange in White Knight. Okay, Fontaine. I'm out. Close the moon pool! Good luck, Ant. Agh, get that boy! Activate laser. Ant, starboard side. You've got company. Uh. That's not company! Company brings cake. I'll try to slow 'em down. Discharging bilge tanks. Have a nice day! Uggghhh!!! That's a nasty bit of business! That's the last one. Huh! [grunts] Uhh! Ant! Ant! Come in, do you read!? Stop right there! No one messes with my son! Mom! Dad! The White Knight's systems are down. Ant's got no power, he's got no air. Ant! Ant! Do you read me? [grunts] I take it back. You can see just fine. If you're happy with the head you have, you may as well keep it. [sighs] Open the Moon Pool, Fontaine. We're coming in. Huh? The Dark Orca. We shoulda known. Try to catch us now. No! They're getting away. Fire another grappling hook! Eh, uh, it's our last one, Captain. Oh I'm sorry, are you saving it for a special occasion? Agh! Primary propeller is down. We can't outrun them with only one prop! We have to. We can't let them get their hands on the scroll. The volcano. It's going to blow. We have to stop! Hello Nektons, this is the Dark Orca... ...You can't go forward and you can't come back. Surrender your vessel. Uhhh! I repeat, surrender your vessel and all its contents NOW! Fontaine, how hot is the water around the volcano? You can't be serious. No. He's right! The Dark Orca would never follow us through an eruption. Fontaine?! Twelve hundred degrees Celsius and rising. The Aronnax is titanium alloy, she can take it... but only if we go now, before it gets much hotter. We've only got one prop! Even with half the power, your mother can still out-pilot anyone. You're the captain, Captain! Buckle up! Backpack development log. Add a seat-belt for the Jorange. Thirteen hundred degrees. It's okay. Titanium doesn't melt under 1600. Yeah, but I do. The Aronnax is moving again, Captain. It's heading straight for the volcano! What!? Don't let them get away! You mean follow them? Into the eruption!? [growls] You're the captain, Captain. What's the temperature? The gauges don't work Captain- What?! He said the gauges don't-- I heard him it first time! Let's go after them! Hold on! The upper hull is almost melting, we're taking-in a lot of water! Keep! Going! We're nearing maximum hull temperature. [grunts] Almost there! Seismic activity peaking! Hang on everyone! (All): Whooaa! Arggh! Pull out! You've turned us away just in time Captain, there's no way they've survived! [cheering] Yeah haha! Haharr! The Dark Orca, they're turning back! Ha! Way to go, Mom! Alright! Yeah! We did it! [computer siren wailing] Eh, Captain, I think they made it. What?! I didn't know the Aronnax could roll over. Me Neither. But the top of the hull has the strongest insulation. I had to put it between us and the eruption. Just as well you had the Jorange, or Jeffrey would've spilt all over the floor. So, you admit that it's the greatest invention to ever be invented. Fontaine's development log: Admit nothing. Aside from some old graffiti, there's nothing in this gateway at all, Captain. Of course there isn't. Whatever treasure was in there, the Nektons took it. I want it! I want that sub... And I want revenge. No one humiliates Captain Hammerhead! I've searched through the entire scroll-- and I didn't find anything that looks like the symbol from the gateway. Uh, want your coffee on the table so it can go cold again, Dad? [chuckles] No I'll have it now. Thanks. Hmmm. Oh no. Now you're getting obsessed Ant. We're explorers. We have to be obsessed with things or we'd just stay on the couch. The symbol isn't in the scroll. That's what I said. Did you look out of the scroll? What? [grunts] Help me turn it over! Dad! That's it, it's the same symbol! This is just the first, I think we're gonna find more of these symbols hidden in the deep. The start of a whole new path.
