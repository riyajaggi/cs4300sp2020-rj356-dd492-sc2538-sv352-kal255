 Mayday! Mayday! Can anyone read me?! This is Kaiko Nekton of the Aronnax. We're close. What's your situation? We're in a research vessel stuck at the bottom of the sea! Please help! Please, help us! We should be right

 on top of them. ( gasping ) We're running out of air! We can't find you! Huh-? If this is a practical joke, someone has way too much time on their hands - Something big is coming! Help, please. You just have to. I'm so small and all alone, ...and so awfully frightened. I need selfless, stupid,

 gullible do-goody heroes to come save me. Heh, heh, heh. The Dark Orca. Captain Hammerhead. Ah ha ha haaa! Hellooo Nektons! My family are explorers. We have been for generations. While others look up to the stars... ...we know there are an infinite number of things that shine in the darkness below. There are things lurking in the seas that long ago vanished into myth. My family are explorers. And we explore... THE DEEP! ♪ Get back to the Aronnax. Call for help. We'll draw them away. Quick, we can beat them to the Arronax! They're almost on top of us. There! Woah! What?! They're gettin' away! Back this vessel up right now! C'mon, we're nearly there! Ahh! Ant! No! ( straining ) AUGH! I can't move! AUUUGH! Fontaine, lock down the Arronax. ( gasping ) Ugh! The Arronax looks safe and sound. Kids, open the moon pool and let us in. Ant? Fontaine? Attention Nektons! We have your children. Surrender now. Oh no. Fools! You thought you could escape the dreaded Dark Orca? I'm pretty sure pirates need to be at least four foot tall before they can be called dreaded. I'm a great pirate! Puh-lease. You don't even look like a pirate. Where's your eye patch? And don't get me started on your complete and utter lack of a parrot. I had a parrot! But he flew away. To a better pirate? Arrrr!! Hey, no! Hey! Augh! Ant. Stop antagonizing the pirates. Ooh, good advice. Where's the treasure? What treasure? Don't act stupid, Nektons. The word is out. You found somethin'. Somethin' rare and valuable. Somethin' ancient with strange symbols. I want it! I have no idea what you're talking about. Ooh! Maybe they're talking about--? ( muffled noises ) Looks like you want to play it the hard way. Good. We like the hard way. Smiling Finn. You and your sister deal with the kids. Woah-! Talk, landlubber! Heh, happy to. I'm great at talking. In fact, Fontaine's always telling me I talk too much if you can believe it. But, I mean, how much is too much? Is it-- Talk about the secret treasure! You'll have to be more specific about this treasure. Uh, maybe I could talk to your parrot? Except you don't have one. You know - once we get onto your sub, we'll find it anyway. We just thought, if you talked, we wouldn't need to rip it to pieces. Oh well - back to "Plan A." Leave them. What do we do now? We find a way out. ( straining ) Every square inch of the Aronnax's hull can withstand tonnes of pressure. It won't have any trouble withstanding a few pirates. Fine! If we can't get inside, I'll just take the whole thing! Tow the Aronnax back to base. We'll crack it open, take whatever we want, then add it to our mighty fleet. How many ships are in this "mighty fleet" of yours? Well, with the Aronnax... it'll be two. ( straining ) Hey!! Hiyah! Augh! Finn, get me up there! No!! ( grunts ) Woah! Augh! Ow. I think I just hurt something I've never hurt before. Still, that should keep our annoying siblings entertained for a while, right? We don't have a treasure. If we do, nobody's told me about it. Yeah. Well, even if you're telling the truth, half the fun of a treasure hunt is the hunt. My dad loves this stuff. You don't? It's the family business, you know? Some kids become doctors or accountants. I had to become a pirate. Shouldn't you be demanding answers from me or something? Probably but, honestly, it's just nice to talk to someone who doesn't use the word "Arrr" as punctuation. Arrrr! Pirates. Let's see how you do without your guidance system. Ugh! ( beeping ) Huh? The guidance system's offline! We're sailin' blind! What?! How?! Oh I think I can guess. Yeah. You really shouldn't have brought our kids on board. That can't be good. Hey! You're locking me in here? Sorry! But you're holding us prisoner! Maybe don't do that next time. Wow. I think you make a better pirate than me. Can't you do something about that blinkin' alarm? ( humming ) Stop that! Oh. It's the terrible pirate. I didn't hear you coming because none of your limbs are made of wood. What have you done?! Oh nothing too bad. So far, I've turned off the guidance system, disabled sonar and turned up the volume on the alarms so they're ANNOYINGLY LOUD. RRAH! ( growls ) Hey! Be careful! ( grunts ) The engines are stopping! What did you do?! I didn't do anything! It was all you! Liar! You wanted to sabotage our ship! Not this much! Agghhh! Woahhh! Get this ship upright now! The engines are dead captain. What??!! Nekton! Can your sub support our weight? Maybe. If we were on board to pilot. But we're stuck in here with you! Woahh-ugh! Hey! Where's my sister? I don't know. She tricked me and then disappeared. Ow! Finn! We're sinking! And it's all his fault! Come on. We've gotta find Dad. The engine's won't restart. The propeller shaft is completely jammed. And our ballast is blown, we can't re-float! We've got to get off this sub now! Ohh nonsense, we're fine! Then what's that sound? Ah, probably whale noises. How much pressure can the Orca take? Ha! You think I'm going to give up the Dark Orca's weaknesses that easily?! Get out there, ya useless lumps, and get the prop moving again! What am I payin' ya for?! You haven't paid us in weeks, Captain. What if they can't fix it? Ooh, you callin' my crew incompetent?! You did just call them useless lumps. Let us return to the Aronnax. We can save everyone. Save yourselves, y'mean! Why would we abandon the Orca? Our kids are onboard. Oh that's right. They are. And they're stayin' on board! Fine. Go. But you have to take Mad Madeline with you. I don't want my daughter going down with this ship. What?? I'm not leaving the Dark Orca!! Finn, lead 'em outta here. Madeline, you have to go. If anything were to happen to you... You are a true treasure. ...huh? Okay. They're gone. Bleurgh!! Do you think they fell for it? Absolutely. People like them love sentiment and stuff. Here, take this. Make trouble. Find out what they're hiding on their sub. Woah. Woah! Oh no. Gah! ( relieved sigh ) Huh? Perfect. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Ohhh. Hey, guys! Ant! Is Fontaine okay? I don't know. I haven't seen her. You ain't supposed to be here! I heard your crew talking. Your prop is jammed. If you let me head out in this knight, I can get it moving again. You sure you can get it working? I'm sure this is your best chance. Okay. Do it. What are you waitin' for? You scared? I'm looking for the claw that puts your vehicles in the water. What? You don't have a claw? How do you get stuff in and out of the-- AUGH! I like the claw better. ( straining ) How strong is that cable? How would I know? I'm just a kid. You think my dad will be okay? We'll use the Aronnax to pull your ship out of danger. He'll be fine. ( panting ) Full reverse-- gently...gently... ( crash ) The cable! It's fraying! There's too much weight! Ant!! We're losing it! How's that prop coming? ( straining ) It's no good. It's totally stuck! Hammerhead! The cable is breaking! Get your people, and our children, out of there! And then what? Surrender? I don't think so, Nektons! I'd sooner go down with me ship! Hammerhead!! That cable could snap at any moment! Ant! Where are you going?? I'm going back to the Dark Orca. Fontaine's still onboard. Ant, please be careful. What happened? Did you fix it? I'm working on it but the cable holding you up is about to snap! Danny Boy! On my command, fire our grappling cables. Divers. With me! What are you doing back here?! Aren't you supposed to be fixin' the prop? I can't do it alone. I need my sister in that knight to help. There's no way she's leaving that sub. ( sigh ) Then I need you in that knight. You seem to've forgotten who the Captain is around here. I ain't takin' orders from a kid! You can do what I say, or you can sink to your doom! ...what's wrong? I'm just uh...carefully considering me two options. Okay. Danny Boy. Fire grappling hooks! Grab those cables! ( straining and struggling ) Ugh! Ain't the kind of vehicle I'm used to. ( grunting and wheezing ) What do I do now? OOF! You guys really need a claw. That cable's not going to hold much longer. I can't find a place to hook these. There's nowhere on the outside of the Aronnax either. How about on the inside of the Aronnax? Fontaine? How did you...? Wow. You really do make a better pirate than me. We can attach these in the moon pool. Really? You think you can arrange that? Mum? Dad? Fontaine! It's good to hear your voice! We need the moon pool open! On it. Mister and Misses Nekton, I want you to know that your daughter stole one of our suits. What? Yep. You've raised a common thief. Ugh, just ignore him, Mom. Try and concentrate, pirate boy. Whoa, whoa - WHOA! Smooth, steady movements. More like a gymnast, less like an octopus that's being electrocuted. WOAHHH!! Eeeaaaasy does it. We fix this, you'll leave us alone, right? You have my word. Let's get to it! WOAHHH! Okay. Fontaine! The tow cable just went! Quickly! Attach them to the edge before we're pulled out with them!! The cables are in place! Let's just hope they hold. ( scared moaning ) The cables are holding! For now. Did you hear that Madeline? Your ship and your crew are going to be just... Where is she? Nowhere good. What do we have here? ( cackling ) treasure! Another disaster successfully averted! Okay, you're not allowed to talk anymore. No! Ant, the cables are gone! How are those propellers? I'm on it! Go, go! Nnnnnggggrahhh! Come on! Harder! ( straining ) Still no good, captain. I can't get any thrust! Propulsion to full! Yes! C'mon! ( groaning and straining ) Danny Boy! Try the engine now! Aghhh!! It's workin', captain! The engines are back online. AGH! It's okay! I've got you. Danny Boy! Full astern! Woahh agh! Watch out! Y'saved my life, boy. And my ship. ( chuckles ) Thanks. Dark Orca crew -- this is your Captain. The Orca is saved. YEAHH! Smiling Finn...take the Aronnax. By any means necessary! ( straining ) I'd put that down if I were you. Gently. I wasn't stealing it. I... Accidentally slipped and unlocked a highly sophisticated safe? Yes. That. Will! We've got more trouble! What are you doing? We saved you! Fontaine, I don't like doing this. But I'm a pirate, my dad's the captain, and orders are orders. You don't even like being a pirate. It's all I know. HEY! You lied to me! You said you'd let us go! I say a lot of things. Out of my way, boy! No! ( grunting and struggling ) AHHHHH! I'm coming, Fontaine! Just hang on! It's okay, Dad! I've got an idea. Fontaine! These guys don't even have a claw, remember? ( panicked ) Hngh! Agh! Hngh! Augh, ahh! Ahhhhhh!!!!! No! AUGH! Okay. Let's not do anything rash with the giant claw. No. You should leave everything rash to me! Fontaine. Drop me now! AUGH!! Close the moon pool! No!! Get off me, boy!! Augh! Ahh! ( sputters ) What are you doing? That alarm's telling you that I just disrupted your oxygen supply. You've got around two minutes to come aboard the Aronnax peacefully, or we can leave you out here. ...uh, hello? Oh, uh, I'm just carefully considering me two options. Dad! Finn!! You, your children and your crew are leaving. Ant? W-what are you doin'?! You'll need this. ( gasping ) Bye byyyyye. Look, I'm sorry about - Oof! You can be sorry or you can be a pirate. You can't be both. Goodbye, Finn. It's taking a long time to download. Maybe they weren't lying. Maybe they really don't have a treasure. Oh, they've got a treasure alright. Ohh! What is that? Oh!! It looks like an entire scroll of treasure maps! I know! Those lying do-gooders! Oh-ho-ho, now we know what they have. Now we know exactly what to take from them ( cackles ) Uh, Fontaine, until the moment he completely and utterly betrayed us, you seemed to be getting along swimmingly with Smiling Finn. Ugh, what's that supposed to mean? Nothing. This whole thing should be a warning for all of us. We do need to be more cautious about-- ( beeping ) Let me guess. Another distress signal? Yep. And, we're going to blindly rush in to help? Of course we are. This is the Aronnax. We see your beacon. What's the problem? ♪ ♪
