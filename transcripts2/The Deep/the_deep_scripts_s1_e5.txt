 [snores] [grunts] [loud clangy sounds] No! What...? What are you doing? My fridge! My family are explorers. We have been for generations. While others look up to the stars... ...we know there are an infinite number of things

 that shine in the darkness below. There are things lurking in the seas that long ago vanished into myth. My family are explorers. And we explore... THE DEEP! Ant? Ant? Ant? You've been in your room for so long that Mum and Dad sent me to check that you actually exist and we didn't imagine you. Uh... Hey, Giant mess.

 Have you eaten my brother? I'm busy, Fontaine. Busy making a mess? I'm studying. Studying what? Aliens! Sure. Aliens. You don't believe in Aliens? I believe in a lot of things, and I've seen a lot of things. Aliens, not so much. Although it would explain you. The truth is down there, Fontaine! Down there? Uh huh... Yeah, there are hundreds of stories of alien craft coming out of, or going into, the ocean. Look at all this evidence! Firsthand accounts. Strange reports. Missing cows. Cows! Completely gone! You really shouldn't spend so much time in here alone. I'm not alone. Jeffrey's studying with me. Your fish is studying with you? [sighs] I will admit I am doing the bulk of the work. But that's probably because he's distracted. It's moving day! And Jeffrey's moving up in the world. His new home is almost ready. Bigger, better, shinier. (Dismissively) Sure. That's great. Mom and dad want to show us something. Well, sorry Jeffrey. Moving day will have to wait. What you looking at, dad? It's just coming up now. We don't know... Ooh! My favourite answer! Is that the Dragon's Triangle? It is. We're not actually considering going there, are we? Do you know how many ships have gone missing there? That place makes the Bermuda Triangle look like a great holiday destination. Recent imagery of the area has revealed this strange anomaly. Um...that strange anomaly looks like a rock. It does look like a rock. Except, it's moved. Several times. It's even vanished and come back again. I have a theory. Please don't say-- Aliens! [sighs] Ant, it's a rock. Tides have probably shifted it. Sand has probably covered it. Maybe it is a rock. But we don't know what it is because at the moment it's an Unidentified Submerged Object. It could be-- It's a USO! It could be anything. It could. Including space aliens. From space! There's more. Japan sent an unmanned sub to take a closer look. And? And here's the footage from it. Is that an opening? I'm not sure. It looks like-- [gasps] Huh? The sub never returned. So, a mini-sub investigated, and never came back, and now you think it would be a good idea if we went down there? What if that mini-sub had been manned? We need to make sure this thing isn't dangerous. Yes! Alien hunting! Whatever it is, it's on the sea bed near the island of Hachijo-kojima. Did you say Hachijo-kojima? Yes? Where are you going? To find something in my room. Let's not wait for him. I've seen his room. This could take days. Fontaine. Plot a course for the Devil's Sea. I thought we were going to The Dragon's Triangle. We are. It's the same place. It has two terrifying names? Great. Hmm... What? Aw, yes! Aw, thanks Jeffrey! Hachijo-kojima! Yes? It has one inhabitant. Kenji Nokimura! You say that name like we should know who you're talking about. Kenji Nokimura reported aliens on his island. Aliens! Aliens came to my house! In the night they came. They took it. They took my fridge!! So...let me get this straight. This guy lives all alone on the island? Dad? Huh...it could just be a coincidence. And it could be aliens. Are you telling me you don't want to meet aliens, dad? Let's go talk to Kenji. [yawns] [gasps] [laughs] Good!! Huh? Ah!!! Kenji Nokimura? Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! I've been squidded! Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! [groans] Squidded in the face! The very worst kind of squidded! Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! [grunts] Well, Kenji seems friendly. Can we leave now? We probably just gave him a bit of a scare. Come on. Yeah, by all means. Let's follow the crazy, squid-throwing, screaming man back into his lair. It's a house, Fontaine. Not a lair. Okay. Maybe it's a lair. I'll admit it doesn't scream 'welcome, come on in for happy fun times.' Yeah, let's not rush this. Oh, come on. I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. Tripwire! What's--? Look out! Urgh!!!!!!! [laughs] I have you now, aliens! Uh...I'm sorry to disappoint you, sir, but we're not aliens. Are you sure? I think we'd know. Actually, my brother might be one. Uh we're not aliens, Mister Nokimura. But we do want to ask you a few questions about the ones you encountered. So, you believe me? Of course we believe you! Aliens stole my fridge. That sounds very plausible. [Japanese] I am sorry I don't have more chairs. I don't get a lot of visitors. So, why do you live out here, all by yourself? I need space and privacy. The mainland is uh, full of people and noise. It grew too small for Kenji. But you haven't been alone, have you? Tell us about these aliens you saw. It was a full moon. A mournful wind was blowing off the sea that night. [snorts] Wind can be mournful? I was asleep. Which is what I do most nights. Then I was awoken by a noise. An inhuman noise. A...skittering. (excitedly) Uh huh, uh huh! A light appeared beneath my door. An unearthly glow. And in what particular way was this glow different to an earthly glow? Uh, please ignore my sister, Kenji. Sadly, she's a skeptic. I opened my door. And... And...? And they were taking my fridge!! Why? Why would aliens take a fridge? [grunts] [growls] It makes no sense! You're right, Fontaine. It's a very strange thing to do. You could almost say it's 'alien'. [groans] And what I saw next... the light I saw in the darkness, the horrible sound-- [gasp] Ahh! Can anyone see anything? [Japanese] They're here I tell you! What?-- Look out! Ant! Ahhhhh!! My water tank! Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! [pants] Aliens stole my water tank! It's time we checked out that Unidentified Submerged Object. According to the sonar, we're right over top of the object and it isn't moving. It probably isn't moving because it's a rock, and rocks don't spend a lot of time moving. I should be the one to make first contact with the aliens. Because you were born an alien? It's not up for discussion. Until we know what we're dealing with, you're not going down there. Dad, if this does end up being a first contact situation... Ant I promise I'll try not to embarrass the human race. [groans] Will, if anything feels wrong get back on board right away. Of course. Okay. This is strange. "Strange" as in "alien strange?" Excellent! Uh, what can you see? I can see...a light inside. I probably don't need to say this but don't go into the light, Dad. Yeah, good advice. Will. I think you should get back on board our nice, safe, double-titanium-hulled submarine. Yes. I think so too. I just want to get a little bit closer... Dad! Will! Aliens took dad! It's moving! After it! Hold on! Full stop! That cave opening is way too narrow for the Aronnax. I'll take the Rover. You two stay here and-- And what? Twiddle our thumbs while the aliens take you too? So you do admit it's aliens! I admit nothing! Mom. We're not staying behind when Dad needs us. I am every bit as stubborn as you are, and we don't have time to argue. This is how you raised us. [sighs] Then let's go. Can you read me?! Will! Kaiko!... Turn around! If you can hear us, we're coming! Dad, can you see any cows? Ant. Not important! Fontaine, what can you see? Uh...it's basically a long tunnel. It's going to be tight but the Rover should be able to fit. Ant. Light us up. There! It's the missing remote sub. It looks like it's been... hollowed out. It's been stripped of its technology. There's Kenji's water tank. No sign of Dad. And his Fridge! Wow. I really thought he was making that one up. [gasps] I can't believe it. Say it. They really are aliens! Yes! Finally! Wait, there's something familiar here... Uh the way they're all lined up smallest to largest. Hrm...I've seen this before. It's called... it's called a vacancy chain! But I only know of one species that-- Kaiko! [grunts] Dad! They're not Aliens! They're-- Hermit crabs! Everyone! Get your dive gear on and exit the Rover! What? Dad's right. We have to get outta here. Hermit crabs are always looking for a bigger home and we just brought them one. [grunts] But how-how did we-- Ahh!!! Come on, guys, get your dive gear on. Move! All good? [grunts] My mask! Ahhhhhh!!!! Kaiko! [grunts] We're out of time. I've got to blow the hatch now or that crab will crush us all. Forget it! We're not leaving without you! I'm on it, Mom! Ant! [grunts] I got it! [gasps] Move! Go! Go! Go! Go! [roars] [grunts] Ahhhh!!!!!!! [grunts] [roars] That should hold ya. We've threatened their home. We need to get out of this cave. Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! [screams] [gasps] [roars] Ant! [grunts] [growls] Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!! Huh? Huh? Move! [panting] Will! Dad! Come on! [grunts] Can you shake him loose? No! [grunts] Dad! It's got me! [grunts] Trigger your booster! Can't. I've got a control panel malfunction! Ant, you gotta keep going without me. Go! Hang on Dad! Ant, what are you doing? Activating manual override. Woah! Ahh! Everyone, get ready. [cheers] Ahhhhh!!!!!! [cheers] [gasps] Is everyone okay? [muffled jabbering] Ant. Mask. [gasps] That was... awesome! Awesome? Yeah! [grunts] It was not awesome. It was terrifying! We were almost eaten by giant, mutated crabs! You thought they were aliens! Just for a second, you believed! [scoffs] I did not! Did. Did not! Mooom! [groans] Ant, it was terrifying. Fontaine, you believed. Giant Hermit crabs? I know, it sounds strange. But we've been encountering a lot of previously unknown creatures lately. I'm not sure why they're appearing now. It could be warming oceans. It could be something else. The crabs need to find bigger homes as they grow. That's why they were taking things from you. We'll replace your water tank and your fridge. And we'll bring back some hollow items for the crabs, so they won't bother you. Thank you. All of you. For everything you did and for believing me. I would like to repay you somehow. Awe, that's not necessary, Kenji. This is what we do. Nevertheless. I'd like to give you something. I'd like you to choose something from my treasures. I tend to collect a lot of uh...oddities. Huh, can I have this? I think Jeffrey would like it for his new house. [laughs] Of course! [chuckles] Who's Jeffrey? Um... Dad? Incredible. Ahhh...you want that? No, I-I-I couldn't. If this is what I think it is, it's something quite special, Kenji. Not to me. Take it. Please. Will you and the crabs be alright, Kenji? Absolutely. It's kind of nice knowing I'm living right next to a whole lot of creatures that also like to stay in their shells. I don't feel so alone. I really am sorry you didn't get to meet aliens. Uh, that's okay. Aliens can wait 'til tomorrow. Sure. The truth is down there. It's just, today, the truth is a giant crab dressed as a submarine. Huh? How did he...? Aliens. What? Why would aliens come on board a submarine to help a fish move? It makes no sense! You're right, Ant. It's a very strange thing to do. You could almost say it's 'alien'. Hmmph. [slurps] [coughs] Ewwww. I'm sure I've seen it. Will? You were right. It's a Lemurian coin. More evidence. And we weren't even searching for it. It's almost like... Like Lemuria wants to be found.
