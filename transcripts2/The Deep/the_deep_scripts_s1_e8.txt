 [birds chirping] How about we call it "Anteosaurus"? [sighs] Ignore him, Agnes. Can I touch it? Why not? I have. Anteosaurus is a great name for a dinosaur! Ehh? Strong. Powerful.

 Agnes - you're the one who found a whole new dinosaur species- you deserve to call it whatever you want. I can't help thinking you have a suggestion - Hmm, "Willosaurus" has a certain ring. [squawking] Uhhh, bats? No one mentioned bats. Relax. Bats only attack the smallest perso... oh wait, that would be you. Hmmph. Huh? Woah! AHH!

 Will! [panting] Dad! Ant! Stop right there! Come back from the edge. It could collapse again... Uh, but...! Come-back-from-the-edge. Now Ant. [yells] Ahhhhhh!!!!!!!! DAD! My family are explorers. We have been for generations. While others look up  to the stars... ...we know there are  an infinite number of things that shine in the darkness  below. There are things lurking  in the seas that long ago  vanished into myth. My family are explorers. And we explore... THE DEEP! Mom? What are we gonna do? Come on, Will. I think I see something! Ggghaaah! Dad! [coughs] I should have... warned you when you arrived. [gasping] Unstable ground. The stream ends at this sinkhole. And the sinkhole keeps getting bigger. ... at really inconvenient times. So the water flows down - through a cave system and emerges somewhere out there near the Aronnax... I'm hoping the rest of the fossils are down in the caves. With your underwater exploration experience, and all your cool gear - I thought, 'perfect'! I'll accept we're 'very good' - maybe not 'perfect'. My brother has modesty issues. But now, I'm not so sure. It might be too dangerous... One way to find out.... [scoffs] By playing golf? These are "pingers". They're 3-D sonar mappers. They'll float through the caves on the current, map them, emerge into the sea, and return to the Aronnax. See? Told ya! You've got cool gear! Perfect! Plenty of room to get around in the first two caves... But see here - where it vents into the sea, that's a very small opening. It's even too small for a Knight. Okay - we'll swim in from the top. Look - right there... Are those fossils? Maybe just debris. But we'll find out for sure when we dive [grunts] The last pinger Jeffrey. And back where it belongs in my brand new totally amphibious Knight! I call it: The Swamp Knight! Ehh? Your lack of enthusiasm is noted. Ahh! Right! You're hungry.... Have you ever known me not to carry fish-food? Ant? Here - a new hi-tech, super-neoprene, utility-wet-suit. [laughs awkwardly] Look... it's not that I don't appreciate it... but I kinda like my... You've outgrown that one. And, confidentially [sniffs] it smells. Change. Mom, please! I'm not a child! I'm almost legally considered an adult in Zanjakistan. You made up that country, didn't you? I... [frustrated sigh] changing right now. Ugh. New suit... itchy. Ugh! Get used to it. The old one's in the recycling bin. Awww. What's the light source? Not sure. Let's check it out. Wow... Thousands of glow-worms. Now there's something you don't see every day. The glow is their way of saying to predators "don't eat me I'm poisonous". No predators here! Not even Fontaine. Hmm. They're reacting to that bat-sonar sound. But bats can't get down here, can they? Lie down! Flat! [yelling] Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! Ant - they're coming back! AHH! [grunt] [snickers] Bats are no joking matter. Ant. Behind you! I'm not falling for the same thing twice. Well, not after all those other times. Ant. Turn around. Whoa-ho-ho-ho. Agnes is going to love this. So based on these bones, this species would've been 12 meters long? At least! Excellent! I look forward to dating it on our mass spectrometer. It's on its way Professor... Fantastic! Done - I'll wait on board for his reply. I'll head back to shore to collect the rest of the fossils. Yeah! [straining noise] Ha ha! Kaiko, we've arrived at the dig site. We shouldn't be too long. Over and out. Okay, let's gather some more bones. [sniffs] Is that your old suit? Shh. It's not an old suit, it's an old friend. It just 'feels right'. We got history together. Gahh. It smells like fish-food. No need to insult it. My old friend and I are going to see if any bones have washed into the next cave. Kaiko? Hah, hah, haahaah. Ohhh, you really had me going there. What are you talking about? I was actually excited - and then I ran the test. Hilarious. Those fossils. They're not old at all! What do you mean they're not old? Igneous rock down here? Uh, basalt...? Agnes - your fossils aren't ancient. 50 years, maximum. How disappointing. The high mineral content in the water must have prematurely petrified the bones. Huh? [sniffs] Hmm, that's not basalt.... Agnes if these fossils aren't ancient then -- those things could still be alive! But it's way too big to be an... (worried) Uhhh. Huh? [high-pitched screech] Aahh! [growls] Aronnax to Nektons.... Aronnax to any Nekton... come in... Come on! [loud screech] [gasps] Ok. I'll just be...very still. And you...can just...stay. [angry screech] Sorry. That's a little bright for you isn't it? [screech] Augh! Close enough. Augh! Aarhhh! Ugh, c'mon! [chitters] Okay...now part of "growing up" is learning what's food and what's not food. And I...am not...food, okay? [squeals] [rumbles and purrs] Wait. You..? You think I'm your mother. [chirps] We won't tell Jeffrey. [purrs] Welcome to the Swamp Knight. Your new, totally amphibious  Knight. Unlike other Knights, the Swamp Knight  can walk on land. It's perfect for boggy  marshes - cave exploring... That's exactly why I'm choosing it! I don't need explanations, Artificial Ant! ...but I will be asking the real you to explain this. Wow. This place is truly amazing. You realize no-one - and I mean no-one, has ever seen this. Other explorers? Nope. Cavemen? [chuckles] Doubtful. [squeals] Uh, now... I'm going this way... and you should go... [sniffs] Wait a minute, is that why you're following me? You can smell fish food? [curious rumble] Ugh. Hang on... I always have some... somewhere... [whines] Yeah, yeah... hang on. Ah! Here... It's not much, but it's high in amino acids and vitamins... Whoa! Healthy appetite... Sorry little guy... I'm out. [squeals] Woah! The Swamp Knight has  extra-thick armour -- extra storage compartments -  and extra strength! Extra strength is just what I'll need. Ant! This thing is too powerful. It's complete overkill! Augh! Of course, this extra strength should be taken into account in everyday operation. Woaaah! We wouldn't want any accidents. Woaaaah! We're going the wrong way! There you are. [nervous laughter] ...what? I've got... 'news'. [chirps] (softly) Ant... He's a baby. I've got no idea why he's following me. Except maybe... possibly...because I fed him? Ant, that's a very big baby. Which means...those aren't fossils. Let's not make any sudden moves. [roaring screech] Huh? [growls] It's okay little guy - "friends". I guess I just naturally 'attract'. Heh! Like a magnet. Hey! I told you - that's not food. [satisfied growl] It just smells like it? Ant - if that's a baby - it's got a very big mother somewhere. This is not a safe environment. Right. I can return it. Ant! Oof! Woaahh-ugh! You'll note that the thrusters  are more powerful than any previous knight... What? Oh come on, Artificial Ant! Go down! Down! Augh! ..and it may take some  getting used to, but the steering is now  controlled by head movements alone- Move your head left  to turn left... Right, to turn right... Oh...That's... infuriating! Wo-woaaaah! And up and down. So simple, a child could do it. Oh, is that so? Wait till I get my hands on you... It's okay. I'm just bringing you back home. Remember this? I don't have any more food. I wish I did. C'mon 'Snappy' - let go. It's my favourite wet-suit. Ant...Behind you. Is it bats? I wish it was. Back away. Slowly. [squeals] No, Snappy. You stay here. [cracking sounds] [chirping and squealing] We have to leave. Now! [chirps] Snappy! Forget about me. Look - brothers and sisters. Go. Play with them. What was that...? It's the mother. Dad! Move! Over there! Where is it? Ssshhh. [ROARS] Augh-! [roars] (whispers) Where'd it go? Like suddenly I'm the expert? [squeals] Shoo! Go back. We need to get out of here. I don't want to go back into that. [panting] [chirps] Snappy - you told them about the food, didn't you? He didn't have to. I told you - your wet-suit smells like fish food. I need my mask! Ugh! We don't have any choice. Let's go, now! [panting] You think we lost it? Apparently not. The caves must be connected. There! [deep rumble] [squeals] Aargghh! Don't do that! I'm busy being terrified here. [chirps] Go home Snappy. Your mother is calling you. You should listen to your mother. I always do. Hmm. Okay - not always. This thing is the perfect predator - unchanged for a million years. Not perfect. It's been locked up in the dark. So what? Its sense of smell has probably over-compensated. [sniffs] And you smell like fish-food. [roars] Stay close to me. [panting] Aagrggh! Ant! [strains] Are you okay? My wet-suit is snagged on something. Take my hand! [strain] [roars] I hate to say it, but my suit might have to stay behind. Nekton family, this is Kaiko - respond. Please... This suit really is strong. Ugh! [straining] Augh! Nice undies. Thanks! Are those...little "Jeffrey"s? I'm not even gonna answer that. Yes, they are. Ant? Where's your mask? Oh no! Okay - two of us will share... out of this cave - straight to the surface. Um...Mine's gone too. We can't all make it on one. [ROARS] This way! Follow me! Kaiko, can you hear me? Respond, over... Will? Copy. The fossils aren't from an extinct species! They're alive in here! I know. You're all okay? For the moment. But something big is stalking us. Okay... listen... if these things grow as big as Agnes suggests, there's no way they can get out to the sea. They live their lives in perpetual gloom. Of course! They're sensitive to light. The flashlights should keep them at bay. Mine's gone. Do I look like I'm carrying one? We don't have that option. Understood - maybe you can stimulate the glow worms into defending themselves, remember? Right. [sighs] But noise will attract the mother too. It's the best idea we've had so far. Loud! Yewaaarrghh! Ooooeeeweeee! Yyearrggh! It's no good. They're not afraid of us. We need bats. No one needs bats. [squeals] [roars] ...and now it's heard Snappy. [squeals] [ROARS] AHHHH!! [ROARS] Will...? Are you still there? Please be there. ...can't read you. Dangerous... stay away... Will? You're breaking up... Will...! [ROARS] Loud noise isn't enough to activate the glow worms. So keep something between that thing and us. Where'd it go? Oh no... [ROARS] [SCREAM] Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!! [panting] Your mom's here. Go to her - ask her about her day. [ROARS] [SCREAM] Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! Hey! Over here! [growls] Yeah I'm talking to you! [ROARS] Kaiko! Run! No! Look at me! [GROWLS] One mother to another. Understand this. No-one messes with my family. That's it. Mom! Activate the pingers! The high frequency should trigger the glow-worms! Hah! [high frequency sounds] [ROARS] C'mon! This must be blinding! [ROARS] Woah! NO! Dad! It's okay. Extra armour - Ant. This suit is incredible. And don't forget... Extra strength. WOAH! Ohhh...Augh... [rumbles] MOM! Look out! [ROARS] NO!! Ant! No! [panting] It's okay, Dad... I got this. [rumbles] [ROARS] You just want your baby, don't you...? [rumbles] [pants] [sniffs] [squeals] [ROARS] [chirps] [roars] You've got to watch him. Sometimes he follows his instincts without thinking it through. [chirps] Bye Snappy. Ant! You're blue! It's cold down there. Where's your wet-suit? [muffled laughter] Uh... I made an error in judgement. I was wearing my old suit. Uh huh... It got me into trouble. I'm sorry. I finally let it go. Good. Very "mature". Put this on. Hah! I can see months of paperwork ahead documenting this. It's fantastic! Discovering a living dinosaur is way better than a dead one. [straining] Augh! How did Ant find that baby croc? I think it found him. Ant does have this way of attracting things. [straining] Augh! Thank you, Senator, you won't regret this. So - the local Government'll set up a rainforest sanctuary? They will. They don't want cave explorers getting eaten any more than we do. The forest and the caves will be out-of-bounds. Good. Scary creatures deserve protection too. Even bats - right Ant? ...Ant? ...Eyes as big as basketballs! Teeth like- like long, razor-sharp swords! [sighs] I'm painting a verbal picture here, Jeffrey. Try to look interested. [scoffs] He's a fish. And best of all, it's called "Anteosaurus"! No it's not. Agnes will come around. It's a poetic name. Strong. Powerful. So, have you told Jeffrey you've got a new pet? Shhh.
