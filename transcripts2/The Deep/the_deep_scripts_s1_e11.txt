 It's a giant monster! Ant - "If you call something a monster...?" "...It becomes a monster". You're right. It's some sort of awesome creature! Incredible. I've never seen anything like it.

 And it's already all over the internet. Look! It's famous! And since I discovered it, I'm calling it... wait-for-it... Ant-zilla! You mean everyone on the internet can see this? Totally! I set up all our underwater location cameras to live stream and maybe next year, in 3-D!

 Ant, what's the prime directive of our mission? To protect all life in the sea. You don't think maybe you've violated it? Uhh... Your video has had 1.2 million hits so far. And that's not even the worst part. There are two types of people: the hunter and the hunted. Now, thanks to a post from... ...Ant Nekton, we've been warned of a huge, ravenous, monster threatening our shores. It's time for you to choose a side! I've made my choice. My name is Devil Daniels and I hunt monsters. Uh oh. My family are explorers. We have been for generations. While others look up to the stars... ...we know there are an infinite number of things that shine in the darkness below. There are things lurking in the seas that long ago vanished into myth. My family are explorers. And we explore... THE DEEP! ♪ Name me any savage beast from any of the seven seas... and chances are I've looked it in the eye. Is this guy for real? I have no idea. You haven't seen any of his tacky shows? "Devil Daniels versus Jaws" "Devil Daniels head-butts a Barracuda" "Devil Daniels-Fairy Penguins" Fluffy, cute, deadly. What? I have a broad, general knowledge. Is that bad? Thanks to celebrity blogger 'Ant Nekton', I tracked this beast, but it proved a formidable adversary. Its razor sharp claws almost took my favourite leg! Instead, the monster took a chunk of my boat! But it won't happen again. In the next 48 hours, I will catch it... Maybe he's going to take it to a conservation park? ...and mount it in my trophy room. Auuugh. Not if we get there first. There's the camera. Hmmm. No sign of the creature. No sign of the Creature Hunter either. There's definitely nothing here... Aargghhhh! Euugh. The monster-footage has four million hits. But look at the bright side... There's a bright side? If Devil Daniels had captured that creature, it would be all over the Net by now. True. So we can still save it. No pressure. [sighs] We covered around ten square nautical miles -- and no sign of the creature. Maybe Devil Daniels won't find it either? Don't count on it. Dad? It's been three hours. Are you still mad at me? When I say "mad" - I'm assuming more... "disappointed". "Mad" is accurate. ...okay. Every day more unusual and prehistoric creatures are appearing in our oceans. Why is that? I don't know. But we can't afford to have them exposed to the world until people are ready. [sighs] I'm really sorry Dad. [sighs] I know. This big guy is a real mystery, Jeffrey... You like him, huh? That's good enough for me. As your best friend, I believe you're an excellent judge of character. Uh, uh, the monster came and destroyed everything! It was huge! Like a... like a huge... thing! But much huger! It smashed me boat into tiny little pieces! What we wants ta know is - who is looking out for us?!! Ahh, simple, humble, fisher-folk... Did he call us 'simple'...? The latest victims of a cruel and vicious attack by an untamed monster from the deep. Oh no... These people need a champion. A hero. I believe one man can make a difference. And I humbly offer myself as that hero. I doubt this guy has ever done anything 'humbly'. That doesn't seem to matter to people. He's got over six million subscribers. We can't help it if people believe everything they see on the internet. [scoffs] I don't. You joined a forum discussing invisible time travelers. They exist! They're the ones who hide my socks and then put them back where I just looked! Hmmmph. Watch. Do you see your monster? Not really. Exactly. Shaky cameras. Cheesy dramatic music. Strange edits that cut away before we see any of the creature. Daniels just uses these things to sell more Devil Daniels T-Shirts, caps, and action figures. He has action figures?! Why don't we have action figures? Ant. Focus. I'm thinking, if he can use viral videos to scare people... Why can't we?! Okay - going "live" in three - two - one - Action! Hi, we're the Nektons coming to you live from the Aronnax with an important message. Uh! [cough] Uh, some of you may have seen footage of an unidentified creature- Perhaps called Ant-zilla! It's not called Ant-zilla. I streamed the footage by mistake and now some people want to hurt this innocent creature. Kaiko? Uh, we just want to say that hunting is not the answer. All sea creatures deserve protection. What? Did I mess up the last line? Do you want us to do another take? Dad... this is live. Oh, oh! It's too easy to expect the worst. Most ocean creatures are more afraid of us, than we are of... [ROARS] Arrrrgh! Augh! Grab whatever you can! [grunting and yelling] Ugh, okay - let me get us stable again. Woah-woahhh! Don't look so happy, Jeffrey. I'm gonna have to talk to you about stranger-danger... [low roar] [gasps] Ant! Activate the shields... No, wait! Come back! [sighs] Uh oh... this is still going out live. Terrifying LIVE scenes as the famous Nekton family were attacked by a bloodthirsty sea monster... seconds after telling the world it was harmless. Is no-one safe? Well... no, not really. Dangerous? I heard it has acid for blood and fangs inside its gills! What have we learned? Don't do a live-to-air video. Ever. That's the obvious one. [sighs] Set the sonar to warn us before an imminent collision. Good. We need more handles. When we tip. We need more things to hold onto. There are dents and scrapes - but the hull looks sound. Ahh... small crack. You know, maybe we've also learnt that this creature is erratic and unpredictable. It's dangerous. It's not dangerous. It did attack us, Ant. Unprovoked. Just because the creature hit us, doesn't mean it was attacking us. We're supposed to protect all creatures. People are creatures too, Ant. This creature is acting very odd. See? Jeffrey agrees with me. He likes the creature. I'm sure the creature would like Jeffrey too. A nice light snack. It wasn't attacking us. I-It was trying to tell me something. "Have you seen my extra-extra-large contact lens?" I think it's... afraid. [gasps] That sneaky monster hunter! I don't see talons anywhere. Or even arms! Hmmm. Me neither. There are no scratch marks on the Aronnax. And he said it had claws! Where? I told you he was up to something. What's that? There's something shiny near the... I need you back inside. The creature's been sighted again! The sea monster has just been spotted returning to tiny, defenseless Tweed Island. And I am in transit. Uh, save us Devil Daniels! IT'S COMING! Monster Hunter! Monster Hunter! He has action figures? Why don't we have action figures? Will. Focus. People of Tweed Island. The day of reckoning has arrived. I offer nothing but my toil, sweat, tears and a promise... Oh, here we go. Cue the dramatic music. I shall fight it on the beaches, I shall fight it on the seas and oceans. I shall defend your island and never surrender! That's it. Let's go! Hello viewers. A question here from "Monster hater eight, eight, six" who asks: "Hunting: Is it more preparation or luck?" Excellent question. I would say it's all about good preparation. Which is, of course, another way of saying I make my own luck. Aha! Thar she blows!! Oh no... We're not gonna make it. Almost too easy. Come on...come ON... Say goodbye, Monster. Aaagh! Brilliant. A plot twist. NO! How dare you! I'll head him off. [panting] No! Aaarghhhhh! Auugh. Aaargh!!!!! [panting] Devil Daniels-- We need to talk. Did he just run and hide? [scoffs] Some 'champion'. Excuse me. Mr Daniels? No. No. Don't say "Excuse me." Sorry? Stop apologizing. Take charge! Kick down my door! [exasperated sigh] ...must I do everything myself? Huh, I guess it's true, the camera really does add ten pounds. [American accent] Just look at you, Nektons! Beautiful! Ideal adversaries! We have the bookish giant. Excuse me? The fiery conservationist. Fiery!? The skeptical teen. I don't know about that. And, finally, the excitable, impulsive, non-stop child. Thanks. I have a fast metabolism. Ho-ho, you guys are perfect casting for the villains of my story. Villains?! BUT! Not quite villainous enough for modern audiences. So how about we re-shoot your entrance, huh? Mr Daniels, we need to talk- Be more "aggressive" for the camera! Hey, hey, if kicking the door down doesn't work for you, we can workshop something else...? If you just stop talking for a second, I can- Oh, lightbulb moment! You drive a jet-ski through the window!! We are not going to be a part of your ridiculous video! Yeeeaaah, that's what I'm talking about! Work that anger! Call off your hunt. Now! Uh, let me think for a second. Ah - No! I am the most downloaded sea adventurer on the planet. I can't let down my fans. Sometimes I care too much. A true sea adventurer is a guardian of the deep, not a hunter. "Guardian of the deep"! Oh, that's great! Very marketable! You uh...you own that catchphrase? So either the monster has these things for hands - which would be totally cool - or I'd say you were lying about how dangerous this creature is. Okay, so I exaggerate a tad. The damage to those fishing boats? Old footage. Great editing though. And the fishermen? Paid extras. And paid way too much for those lackluster performances. So, you shoot, edit, and broadcast everything by yourself. Ambitious little monster hunter aren't you? Okay, let's see what else isn't real. Listen, I give people what they want, danger and drama! Cue the monster! [roars] C'mon big guy, we're not the enemy... It's okay, we'll help you. [British accent] Farewell, my valiant foes! [grunts] [gasps] Blast! He's taking the rover! Not if I can help it! Agh! Gah! Go! He's coming for you! Ugh, come on. Come on! Ha ha! I love this machine! Net launcher verses monster! And we'll be right back for the thrilling climax. [British accent] And now it's my net-launcher against your colossal bulk! Time for the Final Act you magnificent, but sadly doomed, beast! [pained wail] What is that thing...? I can't let this happen! I've got a plan but you'll really hate it. That's normal. Huh? We're going nowhere, the intake valve is flooded. Hold on tight. Hit it! Hang on! Ahh, ahhhh. Ant! It's too dangerous! How else can I get to him in time? It's a foolproof plan! I'm thinking there could be holes in the plan. Personal opinion. Have you got the slightest idea what you're doing? Technically? No. Here - you're the pilot. Dad let me show you something. Whoarrrgh! Eugh, sorry! Ugh! Note to self. Swimming: good. Flying: bad. Augh! What's that? More video from a few days ago. He kept this quiet. [pained whine] I knew that shiny thing wasn't natural.... Daniels attacked the creature, not the other way around. Ant was right. The creature was never dangerous- Daniels just makes it dangerous. What? Please repeat. I said it wasn't dangerous. No, the first sentence. Ugh. "Ant was right". Please repeat! Ant! Listen up. Daniels is electro-shocking the creature. What? How? A device in its skin! Activated by his bracelet. Ant, can you hear me?! Can't talk, have to take a deep breath. What? Why...? I'm coming big guy! It's a giant sea horse. Innocent boy in a world of trouble. His only hope - Devil Daniels, Guardian of the Deep! [pained whine] Ohhh no you don't. [roars] Surely it's only a matter of time before the beast prevails. The boy's eyes plead... "Save me Devil!" But now at last... the end-game! [roars] No! [roar] AUUUGH! Uh oh. [roars] [whines] [muffled scream] This is still going out live and it's getting a bit too real. [muffled yelling] [muffled yelling] It saved him? Huh, even I wouldn't do that. Well, maybe I would, but I'd sure have to think about it. [roars] Whoooo-hoo-hoo! Ahhhh!! Haha! AHHHH! See? That's why we need action figures. Incredible! I-i-it saved him! After he tried to make a trophy out of it! I love that monster! [American accent] As I've always said... [British accent] ...this magnificent giant sea-horse must be protected. So vote to "save" on my on-line petition. This is Devil Daniels - Guardian of the Deep. He stole my catchphrase! Oh well, at least that's all he got. Are we there yet? Not for a few more hours. It's a long way to the most remote spot I know. You think he'll be happy way out there? Will there be any cameras around? No way. He'll be happy. You'll see when we get there. Or...maybe...I could keep him? Forget it. ♪
