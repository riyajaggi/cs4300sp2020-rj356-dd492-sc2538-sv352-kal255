 Why do we always get stuck with seaweed-clearing duty? Between the three of us, it'll be done pretty quickly. Three of us? Jeffrey's helping! Good work, Jeffrey! What's -- what's that? Probably nothing. No, what's that? Probably something [into radio] Mom, there's  something headed towards us.

 There's nothing on sonar. Yeah. Well, that nothing is getting closer! Still nothing on any instruments. It's headed straight for the Aronnax! Mum, you gotta move! [grunts] Hold on, guys. [grunts] I hadn't held on yet! It vanished. What was that? I don't know. I do.

 That - without a doubt - was a ghost sub. My family are explorers. We have been  for generations. While others look up  to the stars... ...we know there are an infinite  number of things that shine in the darkness  below. There are things lurking  in the seas that long ago vanished  into myth. My family are explorers. And we explore... THE DEEP! Left. Is there much damage, Professor Fiction? Hmm. Lester, could you join us in the hangar? Looks like we need a mechanic. It was a ghost sub! Look at Jeffrey. He looks like he's seen a ghost sub. Ergo: He saw a ghost sub. Makes sense. It looked like it was made of wood, but it glowed, like a glow...fish. Hmm. Was it a glowfish? No! But it did have this enormous mouth that seemed to suck in water. Swhooosh, swhoooosh! Oh, wait! That reminds me of something I read in the... I did not expect that sentence to end there. Griffin! Ah, ugh! That's what happens when we run inside. Sorry, Dad. Ah, need a mechanic, then? Damaged rudder. We took a big hit. We were attacked by a Phantom Submarine! It travels in the ocean, looking for innocent sailors to drag to their doom! Probably. Izzat so? Were you scared? [scoffs] I'm not scared of anything. But yes, I was very scared. I wish I had adventures like you. No time. There's work to do. I knew your story reminded me of something! The sailor, Alessandro De Salazar. He was an inventor? A genius! Persecuted for his wild theories. Like me! You're persecuted by the conservative scientific establishment? Mostly by Fontaine. Hmm. His last invention was back in 1801. The Conseil, a one-of-a-kind submarine made of wood and steel. That's it! The Phantom Sub! You're sure? Definitely. This is the sub we saw. Ant. The Conseil vanished on its maiden voyage... Well, it's back. Scientifically speaking, that shouldn't be possible. Science doesn't apply professor, Not to ghosts. But why do I have an assignment? Because learning is important. That's what TV is for! Remember the navigation theory you've been studying? Um... yeah. Sure. Then, these should be familiar. The navigation equipment that our ancestors used. But we have GPS now. We don't need - whatever this is. It's a sextant. Where's the screen? Learning to navigate the way old sailors did will help you understand the principles of navigation. And modern equipment can fail. You just witnessed how something as advanced as the Aronnax can become disabled. We'll hide something in the ocean, and you'll have to use these old techniques to find it. It shouldn't be difficult, now that you've studied all that theory. Riiiight? [sigh] Fine. I suppose I can use this to, um... tie things together? It measures depth. I knew that. And remember: We could give you a random assignment at any time. What? Why? Well partly to make sure you're always prepared. And partly because we find it funny. Well. If people who lived before the internet could do this, I should totally own it. [chuckles] That's the spirit. You know what they say. If you don't learn from the past, it'll come back to haunt you. [awkward laughter] [sleepy mumbling] [sleepy] Wha...? Ohhh... ...huh? Wow! [chuckles] Ohhh. Jeffrey? Woah! [gasps and grunts] I need to find balance! Ant... Ahhhh!! Ant! Ant! [huge gasp] Agghhhhh!! Griffin?! Do mechanics not sleep? Sorry. There's something you should see. On the other side of the island. Uh, what is it? It's, um... I-I don't want to say, in case it's not there. So, you're saying it's... a mystery? I guess? So! Should we take the solar skis? Just take them? Like, ride them? I'm, um - I'm not sure if I should - You want an adventure, right? Do you always have this much fun? Hah! Sometimes more. I should tell you. I'm not a great swimmer. Then I hope you're good at holding on! [laughs] Follow me! There, look! Wowww. I saw it this morning, from the shore. Did you tell your dad? No. He doesn't like me going on unauthorized walks. You think we should move closer? Uh, sure. Do you? Okay. What happened? Is it... alive? Can it hear us? It can hear us! No, no, no, this is bad - Let's go! Ant!...ohhh... Oh no! Ahhhh!! NO! Griffin!! [heavy breaths] Woah! Woahhhh! Good morning, sleepy-head! [yawns] Surprise test time! Why? Sailors of old always had to be ready for action. They didn't get warnings about storms, or dangerous reefs, or kraken attacks! But the sun isn't even up yet. Which makes it easier to navigate by the stars. Your mother is out there, underwater in the White Knight. Here are the coordinates. You have an hour to find her, using old navigation techniques. In that boat? Is it an antique? It's the same boat I used when I did this test. So it is an antique. Can't you handle old equipment? [scoffs] Of course I can. I'm already an expert in - This thingie. And you can't use your communicator unless it's an emergency. Got it? Don't need it. I have a rope, and a thingie, and my own formidable wits. [quietly] ...woahh. Woah-woahhh! [relieved sigh] Dad! Come in, dad! Ant? Why are you out so early? The Conseil! It has Griffin! Hold on, calm down, Ant. Where are you? It's diving! What? I'm coming, Griffin! [grunting and straining] Ant! Griffin! Oh no... You're okay! What's happening? We're diving. Dad! We're two miles north of - Dad? Ant? Can you hear me? Please respond. What happened to you? I was sucked into a pipe, I hit a filter. I thought I was done for. And then I looked up and I found a hatch. No! It'd flood if we open it now. So, we're trapped? I think so. Who's driving? I don't know... Ant? Do you read me? If this is a prank, tell me now. I promise to laugh. Come on, Ant. Just answer me. "The Conseil"? Excuse me, Will. Have you seen the boys? Griffin's not in his room and two solar-skis are missing. Ant said the Phantom Sub took Griffin, and then we lost contact. What?! Probably just a prank. You know how boys are. They're probably just having a little adventure. [sighs] I always told Griffin that adventures were for fools. Come on. Let's go find our boys. It sounds strange but it could be nothing. I'm going to head out in the Rover just to be sure. I'll stay put - I should be  here when Fontaine finds me. Okay. Are you coming? I usually just fix the subs. I've never really travelled in one before. It's okay if you don't want to come. I'm sure I'll find the boys. Nah. I'm-I'm coming. Can anyone read me? Dad? Dad? [sighs] Nothing. No signal at all. This hull is thick varnished wood. It could be blocking the signal? There has to be someone driving. According to its tracker, one of the solar-skis is right above us. The other one's just over there. But where are the boys? Griffin doesn't...oh, I never really let him swim. Let's be calm and not jump to any conclusions. They're together. They'll be fine. Let's keep looking. Okay, if that star is there and...oh, I get it! I totally get it! I have conquered you, sextant! And that means mum should be right over-- Whoa! Woahhhh-! [gasps] No! Oh no. Are all your adventures like this? They're not usually this... scary. At least it can't get any scarier. For future reference, on adventures: We never, ever say things like that. Ugh-! [gasps] It's him. De Salazar. Whoa! Not gonna use it. Not an emergency. Not yet. Uh, Mister De Salazar? (Both): AAAAAGHHH! [relieved sigh] But, if the ghost of De Salazar isn't driving... ...then who is? This is gonna work. It's not working! No! [groans] Kaiko? Any sign of Fontaine? No. And her deadline has come and gone. What about the boys? Still missing. But we'll find them. Okay. I'll track down Fontaine. [sighs] I thought I could keep him safe, keep him under my wing. [chuckles] We all think like that. Do we? I don't like Griffin going out for a walk by himself. Your boy puts himself face-to-face with sea monsters. Yes. And I wish he wouldn't. But you prepare him for it. Griffin's out there. And he's not ready for whatever's he's facing. Maybe. Or he maybe he's more ready than you realize? I can steer it! I knew I'd be a good Captain. Who says you're the captain? The hat says so. The sketches in this book... I think this engine is water-powered! Like the one on the Aronnax? Like an old version of it. The water level doesn't seem to stay consistent. Maybe that's why it sits still sometimes. It's refilling. Ant, look! [gasps] Oh no! How did it do that? It senses changes in the water pressure. That's how it avoided collisions over the years. What is that? A rowboat? Who still uses rowboats? We're in a 200-year-old wooden submarine. Good point. Is that Fontaine? What's she doing all the way out here? We're going too fast! We're going to shoot right past her. We need to slow down and rise up. Okay. How about...this. We're slowing down! What did you do? I don't know. I just...pulled this lever. [strained breathing] Woah! ...huh? Griffin! Come in! It's perfectly safe. Ant's in charge! [grunts] That doesn't sound 'perfectly safe'. Wow. I know. It's creepy, but kind of cool. So far, just creepy. Where is this light coming from? I think it's an algae that traps bioluminescent gas. Or it's magic. Welcome to my ship! Your ship? Before me, the captain was a coat rack. Easiest mutiny ever. Ah... I think we're diving, guys. Ant, do you even know how to control this thing? Sort of. Except I don't really know where we are. Or where we're going. I know our current position. And I know the exact heading to mom. Ant, can you do everything I tell you to? Everything's worth trying once. Steer us to port. To the west. Stop! Back a little to starboard. Stay on this course. We're going home. Uh, guys? The sub is speeding up again. By itself. WOAH! We're dropping fast! But why?! Oh, there has to be something in here. Come on, come on, come on - I thought this was a manual, but it's useless! Fontaine, take the wheel! Griffin, we need to go up. Try that lever again. It's not working! The weight of three people! De Salazar designed the sub for himself alone. I get it. Weight is crucial. And we ruined it! A wooden sub can't possibly handle these depths! What does that mean?! We're gonna implode! Uhhh! Ohhhh! [groans] We're falling faster! WOAHHH!! We're taking on water! Uhhhh...oh! I remember something from the dream. I need to find balance. Ant, we could implode! Is this really the time to be discussing your dreams? That bubble. It indicates the Conseil's stability. Should it be off-centre like that? I just need...to find... the balance. We're balancing out. Fontaine, can you maintain course? I got this. That's not good. Ant, we need to go up! Now! [straining] We can't! There's too much water! We need to turn off the water. [deep breath] Griffin! Woo-hoo! Yes! We did it! And you said you couldn't swim. Heh. I surprised myself too. Ahhh. Beautiful. [heavy sigh] Whoa! Balance, remember?! This is where I was supposed to find Mom. I think. Hopefully she's still nearby. Guys. This isn't a manual. I think this is De Salazar's diary! Salazar used glowing algae. I was right! Be careful! Woah, woah, woahhh!! No! Ah! Got it. And I found you!... Do I still pass? [chuckles] You pass. Dad! I went on an adventure and I didn't implode! Without Griffin we'd still be down there. [sigh] "Not imploding" goes in the win column. Incredible. De Salazar was years ahead of his time. Some of the ideas in here... oh, the adventures he had! Uh, I think I've had enough adventures, for today anyway. There're plenty of adventures here, with very little chance of imploding. How about we take the solar-skis for a ride? Wow, really? Really. [gasps] A-ha! Read. "I am as proud of this, my Conseil, "as I am of any of my inventions. "I believe this automated submersible could travel "the limitless blue oceans long after I'm gone. "Perhaps it may one day encounter "that lost world I have always sought." It's signed... "Alessandro Nekton"! [gasps] De Salazar was a Nekton? So the water powered engine on the Conseil...? ...Really was an early version of the Aronnax. The Nektons have been developing that technology for generations. Yes. Quite remarkable. Hah! This sub is revolutionary. We could study it for weeks and only scratch the surface. Oh this is so exciting! Oh no! The Conseil! AH! Impossible. We stopped the Conseil's engines. There's no way it could start up again. Oh this is scientifically impossible! Science doesn't apply, Professor. Not to ghosts. ♪
