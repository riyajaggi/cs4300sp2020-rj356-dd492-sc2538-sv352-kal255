 "Because it's not just about having pride in who you are. It's about speaking up and demanding respect from others." White power! I'm not a racist. Okay, race traitor. Do you think Toby will be okay with what we're doing? I know you've been giving Brenda vitamin D injections. There's only room for one princess.

 We full gangsta. Considering dropping out of the race. With what I know about him, Ted Bundy could beat Patel. You've been taking bribes. Shit. You told your brother that the governor is laundering money? I didn't know he was gonna do that! Shut up! Get your ass in the car before somebody finds you and blows your head off. We're gonna be in hiding for the rest of our goddamn lives. I'm gonna fix this. I'm gonna make a deal with Mac and Melba.

 No! I'm doing this. I couldn't find Ann anywhere. What the hell are you doing here? Saving your ass. I can make all of this go away if you never look at Ann again. She... was a liability. Let's find out if you are, too. It's flu season. You know you just killed a cop. A dead cop is the least of your worries right now, Desna Simms. My name is Benedict Liu, and let me be very clear... The three of you are next. Next? What the hell? Professor, we weren't expecting you. Please, let us explain... No need. The governor laundering money in my own casino is a fairly straightforward and damning headline, don't you think? We didn't mean to... You didn't mean to... what? To scam me? And the rest of my family? No. They tried to scam you. I just showed up at this racket five minutes ago. Wait, wait. Macau does not like to be conned. - We didn't con you. - Shut up. The last person who messed with my boss ended up flayed and strung on a flagpole at her child's school. That body dripped for days. Wait a minute. You... You don't have to kill us. I mean, we can fix this. I know you can. You have to. Here's the deal... Macau wants its $3 million back. You have 24 hours. And please, don't try to run, because I will find you. Shit! Shit! Shit! This is exactly what we were trying to warn you would happen! You've been stealing from one of the biggest criminal organizations in the world, and now this shit is my fault? Well, who else's fault would it be? If your not-so-quiet friend had just kept her dykey mouth shut. She is gonna be devastated. They were engaged! Boo-hoo. How are we gonna find $3 million by tomorrow? How did The Professor know so much? Maybe there's some snitch among us. We got... We got to figure out how to get the money. Um, ma... maybe we could take it from the casino. That is just like scamming from Macau all over again. Don't y'all got some art we can sell? No way. We will never part with that. Don't you have friends that deal opiates? Not $3 million dollars worth. What am I... What am I gonna tell Ann? This is gonna break her. I have messed up so much for my girls, and I... Then do them a favor... Don't mess up. "Honey"? Desna? I j... I just lied to my best friend. I bet you're wishing you had taken that initial buyout we offered you. We need to figure out how we gonna come up with this money, okay? You need to use whatever brain you got left after huffin' that shit so that we can regroup and come up with a goddamn plan. Okay. Fine, we're gonna, have our guy take care of her body, okay? Whoa. You will not be messing. She deserves a funeral. Sure. We'll just send some coffin selections over. We should just leave now. Not until Dean wins that mahjong tournament and we get his windfall. Did you hear what The Professor said? He'll kill us if we don't get the cash. The tournament's coming up. Do not deviate from the plan. We get the cash, we wait, we lay low until Dean wins, and then we go away. Baby, that fight we just had at the Tomato Oasis has already gone viral. Good. We need to shame those racists. Yeah. I bet a bunch of white supremacists are gonna be gettin' they pink slips because of us. Now we really are superheroes, Yeah. Allies in the fight for change. What the hell? This is that goddamn publisher. Yeah, and the Bleach Boys. Where's the race? You doin' NASCAR? Mama, Jesus Christ, you are like a whack-a-mole. No, we're being punished for havin' minority relations. Besides, nobody races in a minivan. Well, hey, I got an idea. Hey, what if y'all just deal with this little mishap and I'll go take care of the girls? No, Mama. We have a sitter. And she's actually sober. Come on. I promise I won't take 'em to the strip club for the free buffet. Mama, thank you, but no thanks. But if you do swing by the buffet, could you pick up some chicken nugs with ranch? Yeah. I know you're lookin' at that old piece of chewed-up gum. Look, boy, I-I told you I'd make my decision. I'm figurin' it out. If you have to think about it, then you've already decided. What do you mean she's dead? This guy they call The Professor just Black Dahlia-ed her right in front of me. And I couldn't do nothing to stop it. How can I tell Ann that the love of her life is dead because of me? These Triads ain't playin', Poor thing. I know. This is gonna push her over the edge. I know. And that is why we can't say nothing about this, okay? If Ann finds out about this, she's gonna be out for blood and get herself killed. Yeah. We got your back, okay? She didn't want this. I convinced her. Pol, I convinced all y'all. Honey, you can't do... Joe. Joe, hey. Pol, you keep your eye on him. And you find out what he's up to. Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Remember... Not a word. Come on. I got to get my hands on some serious cash. What do you mean? All that laundering shit that I told you Mac and Melba was doing... They got caught. And now the Triads say we owe them $3 million by tomorrow or we're dead. Well, I ain't gonna let that happen. Roller, where am I supposed to get that kind of money? Let's holla at Uncle Daddy. He gonna help us out. Hell no, Miss Desna. Are you out of your mind? The Triads? Shit. You might as well put a target on your back and call it a day. They that crazy, Unc? And then some. $3 million, that's a tall order. Good luck. You don't have a rainy day fund or nothin'? If I had a rainy day fund, you think I'd be sleeping on some jizz-filled couch in the Messianic Jewish Center? Hell, I'm two minutes away from a WIC check. My God. You got to have kids to get on WIC. Yeah. I'm finna rent some over there at Shrimp Town. Lord. It's Florida, man. Everything's for sale. Why don't you guys just take them out? Have you not been listenin', boy? You don't take them out, they take you out. And your whole family. We're in some deep shit. You can say that again. What? What the hell is goin' on? Is that those pasty-ass dudes from the Tomato Oasis? That's that racist piece of shit, Chad... That guy who wanted to publish my book. I knew it. Our country is being overrun by criminals, rapists, and drug dealers. This strip mall is a perfect example. Yeah! This used to be a pharmacy where my granddaddy would take us for ice cream sundaes after church. And there used to be a carousel here in the parking lot where we could ride horses in peace. And now, look around. There's used needles and nappy hair weaves. Yeah! You know, I... I always pictured this great country as a place where we could come together and celebrate our differences. You know... black, white, brown. Spoken just like the radical left! - Yeah! - Get him! Alright, everybody. Disband. Show's over. - No! - Move along. Chad, is that you? Need a ride home? What's up, brother? How you doing? Ann? Arlene? Ann? Arlene?! Ann? Arlene! Arlene! Grab my hand! Grab my hand! Arlene! No! Arlene! No! No! Are y'all serious? Those crackers from the Tomato Oasis showed up here? Yes, and they had the nerve to be all scary with a bunch of fire while wearing polos and khakis. Now I can't even wear khakis. Got a whole closet full of polos. Baby, come on. Sit down. That ain't the last we heard from these deplorables, I can tell you that much. Yeah, and now we got a thousand new creepy-ass - followers on Instagram. - No. I don't have time for this bullshit. I got to figure out how to get this money to keep Macau off our asses. Shit. Hey. Des, something's wrong with Arlene. What? What you mean? I don't know, she hasn't been back and that is not like her. I got a strange feeling something's really wrong. I mean, she... She texted me "honey." She never calls me honey. I'm scared. Slow down. Slow down, I... I can't understand what you saying. She said she was gonna go to the casino. Did you see her? No. I didn't, but I am... I'm so sure she's fine. See, I'm gonna go look for her... No, no, no. Listen. Alright, you are still in a lot of danger. Well, I'm gonna take my chances, then. No, you're not getting it. Macau is here. You hear me, Ann? We are at DEFCON... Whatever it is. So I need you to sit tight. Okay? We... We will figure this out together. Screw that. Hey, Des? You okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Alright, listen up. I ain't waiting around no more. Chad's trying to sneak something past the rooster. It's time to take this mofo out! Fire up them interwebs, find out where he lives. I'ma string his ass up. Hey, Uncle Daddy, that's what we against. Right. Alright. Whatever. - Found him. - Where does he live? That's a plantation. Damn. That's some "Gone with the Wind" shit right there. Son of a bitch is stacked. It says here he has the largest collection of Confederate memorabilia in the state. Stuff could be worth millions. Yeah, so? So we use the take to pay back Macau. We kill two birds with one stone. Dean. Dean? Yeah. Hey. Have you seen Arlene? Um, I... I observed her earlier, heading... Heading toward, Mac and Melba's office. Are they here? No. I think they left for the night. They're probably hot-tubbing... B... Bye... Bye, Ann. What an energetic woman. Sh... She's Arlene's fiancée. She's having a baby. Interesting. Yeah. Do you know how many people touch these things? 5,373 per week. You seem to know a lot. I like you. You want to rob Chad Beauregard? Hell yeah. He's got a ton of Civil War shit in his house, and it's worth at least three mil. I'm all for it. I've never met Chad, but I hate his whole family. You know them? Yeah, but we don't like to talk about it. But we will. That schmuck's father kicked me out... Us... of the White Beach Tennis Club. Apparently, they take the "White" part very seriously. Told me to go back to my own country. I almost smothered him with a smallpox blanket. Let's ruin that tennis-playing cocksucker and save our lives. Polly, I just tried Desna. She's not picking up. Do you know where the hell Arlene is? I'm kind of in the dark on that. Desna told me that Arlene didn't come by Bayside earlier, but Dean told me she did. Is Desna lying to me? Hello? No, Desna would never lie to you. Ooh, I'll talk to you later. Hey, sugar. You got to be kidding me. Polly, what in the world are you doing here? Well, I should ask you the same thing. It's better you don't know. What is going on? I'm killing the governor. What? Are you serious? That's what The Professor's making you do? I have to kill Patel or things will only get worse. He's got enough evidence to incriminate all of us. Your girl Desna included. He's the governor of Florida, and he's holed up in an abandoned warehouse? Not abandoned on the inside. It's just for show. There's a full-on sex dungeon in there. I like the sound of that. But this is the Sunshine State. It won't be so sunny when it finds out that someone killed him. You're never gonna get away with this. People know Patel's in despair. I'm gonna make it look like a suicide. That is your specialty. Okay. How are we gonna do this? I'll handle it. Like I said, the less you know the better. This is about Desna and my crew. And a sex dungeon. I am doing this with you. Are you sure? I don't want you getting committed again. Okay, I'm not gonna lie. That's always a possibility. But right now, I've never felt more sane than being right here with you. Looks like the governor's got company. We'll wait for her to leave, then we'll do the deed. Awesome. I love a good stakeout. Get down. Get in the car. Yeah, okay. Now let's do it together. Hi. Can I help you? So sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but, - Unfortunately, there's been a series of carjackings in our beautiful community. Yes, and the perpetrators are three large black men. We're, neighborhood watch. Yeah. We were hoping that, we could talk to you about protecting our, precious little enclave. Yeah, from... The blacks. Say no more. I'll have the maid bring us out some sweet tea. Please, sit down. Thank you so much. Thank you. - Right here? - Please, yes. Southern hospitality... love it. Right there. I'll be right with you. Okay, they're on the porch. Wait, wait, wait. Look for the gold Confederate bars, okay? They belonged to Robert E. Lee. It's worth a shit ton. - Alright? - Come on. I can't believe we're doing this. I'm Lieutenant Diaz. How can I help you? Yes. I am looking for Detective Arlene Branch. You're Ann. Nice to meet you, finally put a name to a face. Let's take a walk outside. Branch didn't get in touch with you? No, I haven't heard from her since last night. Shit. Sorry. That's my fault. Look, I... I shouldn't be telling you this. But the Feds and Sarasota vice got a big sting operation going down, and they needed a seasoned female detective. So I sent Branch in. It's a deep cover assignment. She'll be offline for a while. She texted me last night. She didn't say anything about being undercover. Everything went down so fast. Look, I'll contact the team, tell them to send a message to Branch, and have her reach out to you. Alright. Thank you. Don't worry, alright? Yeah. Hey, and mazel tov on the baby. We're all real excited for y'all. Yes? Arlene's girlfriend was just in here, but I did what you said. Good. If it comes up anymore, shut it down. Yes, sir. Answering your phone during play is considered bad etiquette. It disrupts the flow. Mea culpa. I realize it's none of my business, but your flow seems to have slowed since your friend came to speak to you last night. She's actually my sister's friend. They're always getting into trouble. Your sister? Yeah. She's a good person, but she does bad things and sometimes I wonder if she's a bad person. But... But also, she hovers. Or maybe she just values you and your relationship. Yeah, I guess. But... But it's not just her. My fiancée and I just broke up. But I don't... I don't need them. I have a coping mechanism that really works. And now I'm having a pleasant conversation over mahjong with a new friend. Smile, new friend. Damn, looks like somebody inherited Granny's mansion. Shit. Dean is with The Professor. That's a warning. He means business. I know. Maybe I should leave. No, no, no. He'll be fine. If this pussy can't get him away from the mahjong table, nothing can.Okay. Well, let's just hurry up and get this shit over with. Y'all two go upstairs. You come with me. Okay, good. I'll get my steps in. And I'll get our reparations. Just hurry up, Spike Lee. Shit. My God. This whole wall is a full-on hate crime. Well, I'm glad we all see eye to eye on this. I mean, it's a shame what... What's becoming of our neighborhood. Not just our neighborhood, our country. I mean, what is happening to America? Tell me about it. It's like they're trying to take the country away from us. Yeah. I mean, look. Look, I... I used to be okay with the coloreds and whatnot, you know? Right. But, shit, I got a lawn jockey in my front yard, you know? He does. I tell you, if one more of them take a knee, I'ma switch that channel right over to hockey. Amen. I don't have a problem with black people. - I don't either. - Never have. - No. - Who does? Come on. Listen, we love black people, all of us. Love. It made more sense when it was separate but equal. Yeah, it did. Now everybody's mixin' together, all this multi-culti, biracial. It's confusing. It is confusing. Who are you? Who are you? I don't know who you is. Some of them are nice people. Sure, sure. But it's not what our founding fathers wanted, I know that much. I tell... I tell you what. To your point there, like Ben Carson... Clarence Thomas, those types... Yes... hell, man, them's... them's different. Yeah, they are the exception. Look at these gorgeous snowflakes. They're coming with me. Shit. You hear that? Get... Get over here. Get over here. Okay. You know what? You might be interested in, joining an organization that my great-great-granddaddy founded. Tell me more, Chad. There's a new dress code. No hoods anymore, just red hats. Chad, red is my color. Jackpot! Des, these are the gold bars I was telling you about. Ooh. This cocky shit, actin' like he live in a museum. We got to get in that case. Yeah. You're not getting into anything. - Hold on. - Don't try it. - She's not trying anything. - Really? Well, it looks like you're breaking and entering. You... Maybe we can work this out. You trying to buy me off? No, I'm just trying to come up with... With a plan that's mutually beneficial. I mean, you can't enjoy working for this racist asshole. Chad's not racist. He's just proud of his heritage. Well, that's racist. Cha... Finally a swastika put to good use. What'd y'all do? Take this. Tie her to this chair before she get woke. I'll do the honors. Careful, careful. Shit. T-Tardiness is very unattractive. You know this turns you on, Dean. Same as last week? This is Detective Arlene Branch. Leave a message after the beep. So, I spoke to your boss and she told me that you were undercover. But then I went to the house and none of your clothes are gone. Something's wrong. I know it. And I'm scared, Arlene. You just can't disappear when we're having a baby. You need to be there. What if the baby got sick and needed to go to the hospital? You don't understand, Arlene. I can't do this without you. I need you. I love you. You need to call me right now. You did so good organizing that trail mix. Thanks. But... But I will say they... They use twice as many cashews in those packages as almonds. I-I wonder if there's an almond shortage. Who knows? So, do you want me to do anything else, handsome? You... you could look at your Instagram. Okay. Virginia? Virginia? I-I think you mean, "okurrr." I don't know how to do that. Ooh, look, I got 30 new followers. So, do you want to just do what we did the last time and keep talking, or do you want to have sex? I'm pretty good at it. I-I know you are, Virginia. I love having an equally fulfilling relationship with you and mahjong. So... So for now, I'd just like to watch you navigate the ins and outs of social media. Okay. Okurrr. Yes. Thanks. Thank you, Virginia. Hey. Hey. We're on. Let's do this. Whoa. Sweet baby Jesus. Hey, gov. What are you doing here? Tying up loose ends. Joe? Joe! Now what? Now what? Let me get some more tea. Imogene, where's the sweet tea? Excuse me. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Chad, Chad, Chad. Wait! Chad, Chad, get back here. Let's talk about the war on Christmas a little more. Excuse me. Let me get some... I'm seeing a white Jesus... What the hell? Whoa, go, go, go, go, go, go! Come on, let's go, Gin! God. Ooh! Imogene! Mac! Go time! Go time! Go time! Come on, now! Give me the bag. Give me the bag. Give me the bag. Go, go, go, go. - Go! - Back here! Shit! Look out! I will stand my ground! - Baby love! - Shit! Get in! Go, D, go! Put your foot on the gas, Melba, now! Stay with me! Holy shit. Hold on! Holy shit! This is what I was worried about. You not being able to handle the darkness. I'm handling it just fine. So why are you crying? Because I'm just so happy. What? The darkness... I'm not afraid of it anymore. When I thought that you were gonna die, I knew I had to embrace it. I've looked into that void before, when I didn't save my twin sister's life. But this time, my only instinct was to save yours... no matter what. It's like after looking into all that darkness... I can finally see. You're something special, Polly Marks. I know. And, Joe? Yeah? I love you. I love you. - Come on. - Move! Hurry, hurry. - Come on, get him out! - Get the door! - I am! - Be careful, be careful! - Dr. Ken! - Go. Go. Ken! Go, go, go, go, go. - Go. - Let's go. Come on, Virginia, shit. - Again. - One more. He's not breathing! Do something. Do something! Can you do something? Do something. Take him to surgery or something! I'm sorry. This isn't an ER. Then why are we here?! I don't know! I thought we went legit. Ken, just do somethin', will ya? - I'm trying! - Hey! I'm... I'm so sorry. Just... There's nothing I can do. No. No, no, no, no. You have to do something. I'm sorry. He's dead? No. He can't be dead, 'cause we have plans! We have a lot of plans! Please! Doctor, please, please. I-I'm sorry. Do it some more. No, my love, no! Please, sweetheart, don't go. Come on, come on. Honey, sit up. Come on, sit up. Sit up, come on. Let's go. Let's go, come on. We have so many things to do. Please, no. Please, Desna, please, what I do? Please, I don't know. Come here. No, you can help. You can help me. Please. Please. Can you do this? Can somebody do something, please? Don't leave, no. Clay, what in heaven's name? Whose blood is that? I-it's not mine. D-Don't worry about that. Okay. Well, come sit. Okay. Let me clean you up. Well, come on. Yeah, yeah. Sit down. You done all this for me? Yeah. You sure know how to treat a man, Ms. Brenda. It's okay. I've been waiting a long time for a man I could do this for. Ms. Brenda, I... I would love nothin' more than for this thing with you to continue on forever... but today, I realized that we ain't gonna be here forever. And you can't hurt the ones you love. And you love Toby? I do. I could've loved you too, but we're never gonna know. Well, can't we just have, like, a secret affair? A liaison? A rendezvous? No, I'm just sick and tired of sneakin' around, Brenda. I'm sick and tired of lyin'. I mean, the old me... the old me had been fine with that. I been fine with two-timin'. Hell, in my prime, I bedded down with a dozen men and three grown-ass women in the span of one calendar day. Shoot. Yeah. But, I'm tryin' to be a better man now. Clay Husser, you are a good man. Don't you let anybody tell you any different. God bless you, Brenda. That means a lot to me. And just 'cause we ain't doin' the nasty don't mean you... You can't keep comin' here and getting the counselin' that you deserve. We'll... We'll hook you up. You got my word on it. Alright. You know, you forgot your purple dildo at my trailer. You want to swing by and pick it up? Keep it. Think of it as somethin' to remember me by. I see you had a busy day. These bars are worth at least $1 million apiece. Those with everything else we got, we're more than covered. Well done. I'm impressed. Where's your husband? He's dead. Thanks to you. What could that possibly mean? He died getting your money, you asshole. Watch yourself. I don't do tears. No, no. No. No, no, no. She... She is just on edge right now. Come on. Hallway. Hallway! Hallway. Hallway. Okay. Um, so we good? You know what happens next. What? Grief makes people unpredictable. And we can't afford unpredictable. So...? She dies. Shit. When were you planning on doing it? I'm not. That's on you. And if you don't... this is coming for you. Where the hell is Arlene? Ann? Tell me. I told you. I don't... I don't know. I don't believe you. I've know you for years and I know when you're lying. Tell me where the hell my wife is. Your wife? Yeah. We went to City Hall. We did it for the baby. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me that she's okay, Desna. What? What? I'm s... I'm sorry. I am so sorry. She's dead. Arlene is dead. No, no, no. How? How? How?! Mac! Mac... Mac did it. Mac? And I didn't... And I...
