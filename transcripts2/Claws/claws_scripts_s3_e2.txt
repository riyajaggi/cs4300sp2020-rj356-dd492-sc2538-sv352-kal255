You kidding me? With all the money I'ma be banking from Bayside, I'm about to franchise Nail Artisans. You wanna be doing nails for the rest of your life, then? Come on, now, baby. Nails is in my blood. And if I wanna be Tony Soprano, I need a legit front. Shit. I hear that. I see you bossin' up, baby. You want some more of this swamp dick? I got shit to do, Roller. Don't you? Oh, yeah, I'm doing it. Okay. Mnh-mnh, mnh-mnh. Let me see if I can find something for you to do at the casino... besides my ass. Ooh, I'ma play me some blackjack. Y'all, this carpet is giving me my full life. Well, tits up, here we go. Desna, what a surprise. We are here and ready to work. Work? We assumed you'd be a silent partner, like Ruval was. I like silence. Desna don't do silent. Wow. What's going on here? Mmm. So street. - Wow. - That's enough, Melba. Let me introduce you to Joe. He's our general manager. Joe runs the logistics of our day-to-day here. He's my little worker bee. It's a pleasure. What an attractive group of young ladies. Well, I'd like for you all to meet my general manager, Polly Marks. Yes, yes. Yes. And, uh, rest assured, I'm highly qualified. I was the manager of Treasure Island... - Maybe you've heard of that... - in Vegas. And, uh, during my tenure, I saved not one, but two FBI agents. She served with honor. Very heroic of you. Hello, "Miss Congeniality 2." Okay, ladies, over in this corner is our VIP concierge station. This is where Melba handles all our high-rollers. Oh, that's for me and you, girl. I prefer to work alone. Oh. What's with all the 'roided-out women? Well, we're holding the Ms. Florida Muscles Contest - this weekend. - That sounds like fun and a perfect job for me and Quiet Ann. We like strong women. And I think she would be great as head of security. - Agreed. - Thank you. But Ms. Muscles is mine. That's mine, okay? We'll see. Mmm. Joe, can you please help Desna and her friends to her office? Y'all are gonna love working with us. Let's go, Joe. I also get an office. She makes my head buzz. We can't afford to have her sniffing around here. She's got no idea what it takes to run this place. We'll have her so busy, she'll go back to doing nails in no time. Everybody, take a seat until your number is called. Damn. How they already know about the clinic reopening? Pillbilly Twitter's even faster than Black Twitter. I ain't understanding none of your words. You, stop that! Then I was thinking I would take her somewhere romantic this weekend, like maybe see Art Garfunkel solo? He just does the high parts. Hey. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. - Flag on the play. - Wait. No, Ken. Wha... You've sent 10 texts to Polly without a response? Well, I mean, she's my girl. No, trust me. You gotta run the opposite polarity, huh? I got a chapter on human magnetics in my e-book. It is a proven fact that humans are repelled by excessive thirst. Right. Play it cool. Play it cool. Ken, the crazies are feigning. - I need help. - Okay. Thanks. You got it. Cool as a cucumber. Well, hey, boy. You here to get back in the family business? Well, Tampa bit ass, Uncle Daddy. I-I just figured I'd maybe do some runs around here till I get back on my feet. Or maybe I'll give you a job at the rehab clinic. You know, put all that abundance stuff you do to work. I could pep talk those pillheads. Anything to get you back in the fold, son. Besides, we can bill Medicaid for an extra $1,000 a pop for "therapy." You know what I'm sayin'? We hook 'em here, we heal 'em there. - Circle of life. - Circle of life. Circle of money. All right, boy. It's so nice having another security guard here. I never have anyone to talk to. Mm. This is it. These cover the casino floor... - Mm-hmm. - ...bar, front desk, VIP, housekeeping, security, restaurant, club, - parking lot, admin... - Okay, well, hold... Whoa, whoa. You going fast. Let me write that down. Good luck. What? I was just get... Hello? Shady Mormons on the casino floor. Shit. Desna? Tallahassee Pete is back at blackjack table 14. I'm the new co-owner. That's not my problem. Mac and Melba said to come to you. It's a part of the gig. Okay. I'll... I'll be right there. No, you need to come now. That Soul Patch Pete's raking it in. I said I'll be right there. Desna Simms to the casino floor. Desna Simms, please report to the casino floor. Over there. Shady, right? Mmm. Card counter's over there. Get... - Please, go. - Yeah. Hello. I'm Desna Simms, the new co-owner of the casino. And you gentlemen are...? You do like to interfere. Nosey little Desna. - Bitch! - Aah! Shit. Beat it. Hey! What is going on?! She attacked me! She called me "deaf bitch," so I punched her! Carl, hold my hearing aid. Both of y'all bitches knock it off! Stop it! What, Virginia?! Des, I-I can't turn the alarm off! Ladies, I'm so sorry! Next one's on us. I promise, I promise! What's... What's the code?! Ah, shit. 1-2-3-4. It's the simplest code in the world. - Stop it! - I'm trying to! Ann?! Ann, where are you? It's not working! Virginia, I can't do this with you right now. Tell her to get here now! It's too loud! It's... It's too loud, Virginia! I'll be there as soon as I can! Will y'all... Ann, come break these bitches up! I can't. I... can't. Too much noise! - It's too much noise! - I... I know. It's... Sir, I need you to calm down. - Calm down. - Don't you touch me! Y-You shoot black people! My partner is black. That's gotta count for something. - Virginia? - Breathe. I'm here, I'm here, I'm here! Turn it off! 'Cause it's too loud, Des! Okay. Uhh! Thank you, Jesus! Officer, I am so sorry. I-I... I'm his sister, and I... I own the shop. I'll take it from here. Yeah, I'll send you a bill. Wow. Hey, hey. They could've shot us, Dessie. They could've shot us. That's what they do. They shoot people. - Deanie? - They shoot... Dessie, they sh... Deanie? Look at me. Okay? I'm not gonna let nothing happen to you. I'm here now. Okay? Okay, wait, what did you do different? I pressed "1-2-3-4, Off," Virginia, like I told you. - You didn't tell me "Off." - Oh, my God! I didn't think I needed to say "Off," Short Bus. That... That's insensitive, Des. And... And you could've written the code down so other people could ac-access it. Yeah, I'ma add that on my list of things to do. - Mm-hmm. - Shut up, Virginia, before I hit you in your other eye. Right there! Just leave it! Jenn? EJ. When'd you get out? Yesterday. Huh. Paroled early. I'm guessing you're not here for a manicure? Nah. - How's our baby girl? - She's thrivin'. You know, I really would like to see her. Mm-hmm, well, I'm not gonna do this right now, so... Come on, Jenn. She needs to see her father. Well, I'll call you! - Jenn! - I promise! - Hey, y'all. - Hey, girl. Hey, Jennifer. - Baby? - Yeah? Are you feeling a little better? No, I'm concerned that the alarm gave me tinnitus. Hey, Virginia. Uh, I meant to give you props earlier. You're... You're really rocking that eye patch, girl. - Thank you, boo. - Do you need anything? Maybe some... some chicken soup? 'Cause I can order some on Postmates for you, if you... Hot foods? Girl, do you know me? Yeah. T-Toby, if you really wanna be of assistance, you can help me find the animal that shot my fiancée. Maybe after my mani. - Baby, listen. - Yeah? You gotta stop. Right, I'm gonna set up another appointment with Dr. Ken if you keep having revenge fantasies. But Dr. Ken's not qualified. We both know that. Des, it's just a fantasy. Everybody got revenge fantasies. I had a revenge fantasy about my mama on the way to work. Do not listen to her, okay? - Hey, hey. Look at me. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Nobody is coming after us. - You got it? - Yeah. Don't worry, Des. I'll keep him busy. She... She's talking about intercourse. Listen. I want you to stop talking about killing people. Just find a new interest. Then sex it is. Whatever works. Polly? What are you doing in my office? Oh, hey, man. Um, I think you mean our office. We can find somewhere else for you. No, no, no, that's okay. As Bayside Rapture's new co-general manager, I'm precisely where I need to be. Actually, if you're gonna be the new co-general manager... Mm-hmm? ...I need you to time-check all the employees. Make sure no one's getting more than 20 hours a week. Copy that. Yeah, we don't wanna have to pay health care. Wow. You must really hate working for these cheap-skates. I owe Mac and Melba my life. They took me in when I was just a kid doing petty crimes. What kind of crimes? Armed robbery, aggravated assault, arson. Those are, uh... Those are felony offenses. Do you wanna maybe go offline and unpack that a little bit more? Shrimp better be deveined. Last thing I need in my life is more shit. Ooh! Damn, Clay. I'm the blind one. What's going on with you? Nothin'. Just, uh, dealing with some pillbillies up at the clinic. Something else is bothering you. Whatever it is, you need to forgive yourself for it. Why don't you mind your own business? There's something weighing on you. You need to let it go. How do you know? I know it's time. Time to let it all go. I can't bear it. I can't bear it any longer. Let it out. Mm-hmm. Let it all out. I know what I gotta do. Mm-hmm. I gotta talk to my baby boy. Yeah. Y'all slackin' or y'all cleanin' around here? You know I like my place on point. Girl, we've been a little bit slammed trying to deal with your clients. - Virginia, get a broom. - Why I gotta do it? 'Cause I said so. I got your text. Figured it'd be safer to talk here. Who were those Mormon freaks at the casino in that picture I sent you? They deliver money to Mac and Melba. It gets laundered in some secret account called "Trip." It's a shit-ton of cash. And let me guess... They don't plan on cutting me in? So, here's the tea. Yolanda said that those freaks got us running all around on some extra shit, trying to keep us out of what's really going on. They're dumping millions into a secret account called "Trip." This Trip shit is just like Zlata all over again. They asses is up to somethin'. Just confront Mac and Melba. Maybe they'll respect that. It's the code of the streets. I don't know. What you think? EJ got out of prison, and now he wants to see Brienne. - I know you lyin'. - I know. Well, what does Bryce think? What does Brienne think? She don't think nothing, 'cause she has never met him and she does not know that man and she did not ask about him and Bryce is the only daddy that she knows. I just got my marriage and my life back on track, and drama is the last thing that I need, so... What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid of nothin'. Shit. I'm afraid that... as a white chick with a black daughter, that I'm not giving her what she needs. And then she will meet EJ and his family and she'll realize that white chocolate doesn't cut it... - Oh, honey. - Oh, no, no, no. ...and she'll wanna be with them, probably. You're making me feel bad for white people now. Ann. Just be open. Meet up with EJ and get it all out. Cap'n Crunch is right. Meet up with the man, confront him. That's what I'ma do with Mac and Melba. We gonna get to the bottom of this shit. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You good? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks for the advice, Jack Sparrow. You're welcome, girl. Let's go, Brycey. No, no, no, no. I'm not doing this shit. Roller, wait, wait. I'm not doing this. I'm not doing this shit! - Wait, wait, just hold on. - Just give him a minute! One minute, come on. Just come in here. Listen, I'm not doing this shit. I'm not here for trouble. I got something to say. You were right, son. I didn't tell you the truth about how your folks died. - Piece of shit. He's a piece of shit. - Roller, I... Roller, listen, come on. Just give the man a... just give him a minute, all right? Look, I got the chair and the table. Sit down, man. Y'all know your daddy was a first-rate gangster, but as a man, he was 100% son-of-a-bitch. He'd get to drinking and be beating on y'all and your mama. Everybody knew what Clyde was doin'. Hell, I knew. Every other day, your mama would come to me bruised, scared, asking for my help. But here's the thing you gotta understand, boys, and it's really important. Back then, how a man ran his family was his own business. So I stayed out of it. On the day your mama died, she showed up to my door with you boys. I wouldn't listen. I drove y'all back over to him. And later that day... ...when I found out he beat her to death... ...I went back over there and I shot him. I'd give anything to have that day back. Anything. Instead of helping your mama, I walked her into her grave. Why wouldn't you share this with us? Why...? 'Cause I just couldn't stomach the idea of his sons thinking my brother was trash. My daddy wasn't trash, you're trash. - My daddy wasn't... - No, it's true, it's true. Roller, I remember. I remember. He used to have me hold his teeth while he beat Mama with the VCR. Why would you let our mama die and then you make up that... that bullshit - with the church?! - I'm sorry. And that pain gonna stay with me the rest of my life. I'ma tell you boys somethin'. I'm letting go of my baggage. Coming clean to y'all was the first step. And I pray to God y'all can forgive me. You're dead to me. Mm. I'm telling you, these people are insane. Girl, they got all up in my face. And it was two Mormons they was walking around with and didn't want me nowhere near 'em. - What? - Right. Look. There she go. They hiding somethin', Pol. If we want to get what we deserve, we gonna have to find out what it is. Oh, hot darn. Ken keeps text-stalking me and asking me to lunch. If he proposes again, I'ma have to check myself back in. - Stop it, Pol. - I'm serious. Hey. Des, I really need to talk to you. On that note, I will leave you two alone, and I'm going to start snoopin'. What's going on? I'm tired of Uncle Daddy and his bullshit, D. Okay, no, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Baby? Baby? - What? I don't have time for this right now. No, D, I need it. - I need it. - Okay, talk to me. You spinning, Roller. - What's going on? - Shh. Stop talking. You want me to squeeze your neck, baby? No. Um, so, the Seaside Suite is out of coke. - Call room service. - No, not that kind. They want me to run down to the corner and get them an eightball. It's a good way to get your steps in. - Can I help you? - I was promised a Coastal Suite, and you gave me a Gulf. Penelope Van Summers. Fix it. Now. Ms. Van Summers, I am afraid the Coastal Suite is occupied at the moment. Well, unoccupy it. Would you like me to call Trip? Perhaps I've made a mistake. Looks like a clerical mistake. The Coastal Suite is available. Right this way. Enjoy your stay at the Bayside Rapture. - Des? - Yeah? You breaking your new desk in? Yeah! Yeah! Okay, listen. One of those body builders definitely knows something about Trip, so you need to get down here - with a quickness. - Ooh! Okay! Mmm. Get it, girl. There she is. No. Oh, so what? Well, whose baby do you think this is? You're the only one who don't wanna use condoms. Oh, you gotta feel everything, Trip? Well, feel this! - Hey. - Hello. What the hell do you want? I am the new co-owner of the casino and... I'm hospitality. So, we just wanted to make sure you were all right. Do I look like I'm okay? This asshole knocks me up and thinks I'm just gonna go away. Why? 'Cause he's married with kids? - What asshole? - What asshole? Piece of dogshit thinks he can just brush me off. Well, he can't. I want you to tell your partners Mac and Melba fixing the contest isn't enough anymore. I want half-a-million dollars to shut me up. Okay. Well, wait. Shut you up about what? Penelope? Penelope? Is everything okay here? Desna, I thought you'd be doing... anything but this. Well, as a new co-owner, we should be involved in all aspects of the casino. Including the Muscle Contest. Yeah, let us carry our weight. It looks like you're carrying enough weight as it is. Oh? You guys can't even handle this stuff. I wanna talk about my money. Melba will handle this. Well, Desna, the Bayside way is to learn from new voices, so you and your friends wanna be part of the Ms. Florida Muscles, then, by all means. In fact, why don't you be our new mistress of ceremonies? Ooh-la-la! Okay. I'd be delighted. Ladies. _ Hey, good call. I've been meaning to try this place. Yeah, Yelp gave it three stars. That's two stars better than anything else in Palmetto. Yeah. Yelp's great. Yeah, it's great. You know, I've... I've been thinking, you've been through so much, you just got out of the hospital, and I think it's... Like, you know, it's unfair of me to come at you with my needs right now. You need to take care of yourself. Wow, Ken. That makes a lot of sense. It does? I have transference issues. I basically made you my dad, who raped my babysitter when we were in high school. And you're blaming me for that? It's not about blame. It's transference. I do all these personalities. You know, I pretend to be people that I'm not so I don't have to actually deal with what's really going on. Right. You're pretending right now. I know, Ken! That's what I'm trying to say! I don't wanna deal with what's really going on. Okay, what... what's going on? I can't be with you. Why not? Because I'm incapable of being with anyone. Okay, okay, just, just... Can we just wait a minute? Can we... This is not how this was supposed to go, okay? Bryce told me to give you space so you'd come back to me. I'm like the wind. You can't catch me. But I love you. And I know that you love me. I know that you do. Do you need to hear me tell you that I don't? Is that what you need? Because I don't. I don't love you anymore. Sorry, man. Brienne, don't dilly-dally. Okay, baby? Just get your doll and go. But there's no black babydolls. Ma'am? You got some 99-cent sistas for my baby girl? No black dolls, but we do have some black tube socks, black licorice, black pens, black beads... Brienne, you look so cool. No, Mom. I'm not going to Thanksgiving at Grandma's. I'm sick of eating pumpkin pie off Confederate plates, acting like it's normal. I'm so sick of being the only black person at every family gathering. You guys don't even know the Stevie Wonder version of "Happy Birthday." You have no idea what it feels like. You didn't even let me meet my dad, meet my dad... meet my dad... meet my dad... ...black garbage bags, black shoe polish... I'll get this one. Nope. Nope. No, you won't. We'll just go somewhere else, won't we? Yeah, we'll go somewhere else. Hey. You were pretty upset last night. You sure you should be doing that? I'm not worried about the competition. I'm talking about being pregnant. Leave me alone. You've got someone else to think about. I know your boyfriend Trip is laundering money through the casino. Tell me who he is. Don't you know? Aren't you working with them? No. I mean, I am, but it's not like... it's not like that. Hold on one second, okay? What do you want, Virginia? Hey, Des. The health inspector came a few days early, and we need a new ventilator. - Excuse me, Ms. Simms? - Des? What? There's a sea hag at the slots who just scored her third mega-jackpot. Desna? Hello? Oh, my God. Y'all are gonna have to start making some decisions for your damn self. I'm busy. Shoo, fly, shoo. Bye. Shit. Honey, I need a favor. Can you read their lips and tell me what they're saying? Sure. Asthmatic Dinah Shore is saying, "The minute the contest is over, we'll handle it. When night falls, so does she. She'll never cash that check." - Damn. - What's that all about? Are they gonna kill her? Um, it's nothin'. I'll take care of it. Hey? Hey. - I got you somethin'. - Aren't you sweet. I'm surprised that you called. Well, I figured it was pretty safe to meet here. You know, it's not like we're gonna do it in the park. Well, there was that one time. Oh, EJ, I forgot. That Girl Scout troop was so surprised to find us on their scavenger hunt. Yeah, they were. Look, I really wanna be in Brienne's life. I know, I know. Okay. And I understand, I get it, but we're gonna have to ease into it. Listen, you're gonna meet her and then I figure, once every other month, visitation... supervised, of course... but I'll bring her to your mama's house. I love your mama. Actually, the law says that I'm entitled - to joint custody. - The law? Yeah, the law, Jenn. Biological parents are afforded custodial rights, regardless of their prior convictions. Oh, I see. So you studied the law in prison? Well, I had to do something since you didn't come visit me. And my own daughter don't even know who the hell I am. It's okay, though. I'm back. And there's nothing you can do about it. Is that a threat? - EJ? - Enjoy that coffee. You ain't gonna get away with it. EJ?! Polly? Once again, you're somewhere you don't belong. Well, actually, Joe... I'm not supposed to talk about this, NDAs and attorneys, uh, estates, et cetera, but, uh... I have reason to believe that this painting here was, uh, stolen by the Nazis. Oh. See, I painted that. I'm a man of many talents. Mm-hmm. You sure you weren't here for this? No peeking. Is that a strap-on? Pre-Colombian. The ancients were hella progressive, Miss Polly. Huh. Well, my great-uncle invented the dildo in Victorian London. And, uh, he used them to treat women who... suffered from hysteria. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - You have an incredible family. - Yep. See, my great-uncle was the Prince of the Forest. But I hardly knew the guy. It was a simpler time then, just me and my mom. My best friends were an owl... And a rabbit and a skunk and everything was A-okay... Until the hunters came with their guns and their dogs and their big fire, and I got separated from my mom. And you never saw her again. Aw. I'm so sorry, Bambi. Did you get what you came for? Yes. I got exactly what I came for. - Baby? - Yeah? We just gonna talk, right? That's what I do. I talk. What up, family?! Guess you guys came to the conclusion that it might be a good thing for Brienne to know a little bit about her black side. EJ, we come in peace. - Hey, Darius. - You're the one who brought your knight in shining unemployment. Captain Save-A-Ho here rolled up like he's a golddigger's dream. You drug-dealing piece of shit! Baby! Hey, hey, hey! You ain't better than me! The only difference between your family and I is that I got caught! - My family's business is legit! - No, no, no. Babe! Better to retail than inhale, huh, crackhead?! Baby! Stop it! Come on, you son-of-a-bitch! Stop! Come on! Did you get that? 4K, baby. Uh, the judge gonna love this. Maybe... Maybe I'll ask for sole custody, huh? You ain't gonna get shit. We will never let you. Come on. You said you were just gonna talk. Hey? Y'all seen Penelope? - Nah. - Nah. Okay, I need y'all to come with me. Now. Come on. I'll be back. Y'all are not gonna believe this shit. Mac and Melba are gonna try to kill Penelope. - What?! Really? - Yeah. Y'all, you're not gonna believe this. I figured out who Trip is. - Who? - The governor. My brother's running against him. Wait, no, the governor's name is Vikram Patel. The Third. As in triple. - Trip is a nickname. - Oh, that's some weird white people shit. No, he's not white. So the governor is laundering money through the damn casino.
