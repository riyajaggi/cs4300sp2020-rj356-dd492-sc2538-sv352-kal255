Jennifer, if you don't whup these kids' ass, I will. Rough night? The worst. All right, time's up. Y'all eat your breakfast before your godmother goes Mayweather on your butts. That is enough. You heard your mama. Now eat it up. Hey, we got to hurry. The lawyer's coming soon. What's all of this? It's fried bologna with Jack Daniel's for my lady. Oh, you doing the most. Yes, I am. Jennifer! Okay, alright, get dressed! Come on, go get dressed. You get the big one. - You get the big one. - Come on, big one! I can't be livin' up in no flop house! We are your parents! Damn! I need to find me a place, like, yesterday. I tried to tell you, you and me get a place together, but... And I told you we should go slow. Remember I said that? Oh, I heard you. But you were wrong. Okay, well, it's gonna take a lot more than whiskey meat for me to trust your ass. You think so? I know you love that whiskey meat. Oh, shit! Goddamn. That's it! So, um, what are our options? Since EJ never terminated his parental rights to Brienne... Whoa, whoa. Wait, what rights? He is basically a sperm donor, and they've never even met. Whoa! How many times you've been arrested... What are numbers, really? It's a concept.Exactly. Thank you, baby. So the important part is that I've never actually been locked up. I'm sorry, does that say "crack?" So we all have a history. Does EJ have a case or not? For sole custody, unlikely, but he probably can get joint custody, unless you want to fight him. We do. We don't want EJ anywhere near Brienne. Right? Right? Oh, Christ on a bike, Bryce. We... We do not want EJ in Brienne's life. I'm just saying, imagine if you told me I couldn't see either of the girls again. Oh, you're gonna do this bullshit right now? Can we have a minute? Sure. Paid by the hour. You are her father. You are the one who raised her. You are the one who was there for her whole life! But the law says I'm not. When we were separated, I was scared shitless you'd take Brienne from me. I would never do that! But you could have! I guess I'm just trying to put myself in EJ's shoes here. Those two deserve a chance to get to know each other, and I won't get in the way of that. I went through enough shit losing my own parents. You get my text? I did. You want hardwood floors, an all-white kitchen, and you can't be the only black person in the building? The only black person. That part. What if there is a black doorman? Does that count? Nope. Then that's a no and that one's gone. Aww, goodbye to the penthouse. You know what, there are so many listings on Zillow. We're gonna find you something.Good. Let's do this. ♪ Whoo ♪ Okay ♪ I got this thing on lock ♪ Everybody can't get enough Oh, my God! ♪ Tell me I'm the queen It's beautiful. ♪ Just watch me now It's beautiful! Right? Gentle reminder... It is above your budget. A boss doesn't have a budget. I'll take it, and everything in it. ♪ Just watch me now I'll take it, I'll take it, I'll take it, I'll take it, I'll take it, I'll take it, I'll take it! I will take it! So if we leverage the infrastructure, we'd have much stronger horizontal integration. Would we? Oh, we would. I got to take this. This is Joe. He dropped his pants at the blackjack table again? Okay, I'll be right down. That dealer's always drunk, man. We need to drill down, give him his notice. I'll recruit for his backfill. What? You want me to workshop the issue? I want you to show me the real Polly. You think that might happen? I'm gonna have to get back to you on those deliverables. Well, don't take too long. Joe Dupree. Ah, yeah, just calling to confirm the Lovestones' 7:00 p.m. pickup for the Governor's fundraiser. Uh, yeah, right. And, uh, drop-off is where, again? 223 Oak Street. Thank you. This is Desna. Leave a message. Desna, it's me. I got a juicy tidbit. The Governor is having a little shindig tonight, and Mac and Melba are gonna be there. I thought we could sneak in, do a little snoopin'. Polly Bird. Call me back. What's happening, Polly Bird? What's up, Roller? I'm working. Hey, I need a little help with Desna. I'm trying to get with her, you know? For real, for real. You mean, for real, like the Obamas, or for real, like Diane Von Furstenberg and Barry Diller? Come on, Polly. I don't know what you talkin' about. She thinks I haven't changed. I want to prove to her I'm a changed man. Oh! Yeah. Okay. Well, first of all, you could learn to use a button. Baby, buttons are for gluttons. Polly, come on. What's that have to do with me being a better person? My clothes? Come on. Yes, your clothes. Clothes are everything, Roller. They show that you care about her, that this is a serious relationship and not, you know, "You know what I'm sayin'? The Players Ball." Women don't like that. I'm all ears, baby. Okay. ♪ Running hot ♪ Running cold ♪ I was running into overload ♪ That was extreme ♪ Somehow the wires uncrossed ♪ The tables were turned ♪ I've got a new attitude ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh Check it out, bitches. Is that an infinity pool? True or false. About damn time you got a new place, girl. Are you sure you can afford it? Okay, you can see it. Now you got opinions. I'm just saying. I set those casino bitches straight. Ain't no way they're gonna play me. And now, I'm living the life I deserve. Okurr? Oh, Des, you bougie now. We all gonna be bougie. Got a right to be. Bougie ass. Allow me to make a contribution. I'll be your pool man if you let me use your pool. - Hell, yeah! - Unh-unh. Don't let Ann do it. And don't let Virginia do it. That's what I'm sayin'. Oh, my God. Shit! Geez! Oh, God! Oh, my God. That's Penelope. Oh, my God. This is all my fault. - No, no, no, Des. No. - This is so messed up. Mac and Melba did this as a warning. If I would have minded my own damn business, this girl would still be alive. I got her killed! Jenn, go get Bryce! He can help us! No! I do not want him involved. Shh! Oh, shit. She... She... She... She was pregnant! Maybe we should pray. - We don't have time for that! - Shut up! Mrs. Schreckler's coming in any minute! Shh! I can't think! All right, all right, all right, all right. I cannot think. I don't know what we're about to do right now. Breathe. Breathe. EVERYBODY, BREATHE.JENNIFER: Okay. Oh, shit. Okay. Okay, okay. First thing we got to do is get this girl out of here. Uh, I'll... I'll pull the van up... up to the back. And lock the door! You go get some towels.Yes. Find me something to wrap this girl up with. Hurry up, Jennifer! Shit. Oh, here we go. Here we go, here we go. Come on, now! They look like they need some rehab. We're open! Come on in! They could definitely use some rehab right there. Right. Look at her. Hey, we could help you heal. Damn. I knew this rehab thing was gonna be harder than I thought, but I mean, I knew we'd take a hit when we shifted gears, you know, but... Yeah, ever since you stopped handing out Oxy like Tic-Tacs, some kind of mass migration took place. I know where they went. I just drove past the Peter Pain Clinic, and they stole all of our pillbillies. Boys, we gonna do us some recruitin'. Hurry up, before clients start coming in. Okay, okay. The van's in the alley. Okay, come on, let's do it. 1, 2, 3! Damn! Muscle does weigh more than fat. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, shit. Oh, no. Oh, my God, please don't let this be how this ends. We cannot have popo sniffin' around, y'all. Pull it together! I'll handle it! Okay. Oh, shit! - Great. - Ann's the strong one. No! Hey. You won't answer my texts. Can we not do this right now? Well, when's good? At boxing? Look... You only want to see me in the ring? I just got a lot of stuff going on right now, okay? You hiding something? Look, why can't you just get it through your head that you and I are over? Fine. I'm getting off crazy train... Good! ...For good. - Push! - To the right, to the right. She's in, she's in, she's in, she's in. Okay. Go get some bleach, finishing cleaning up the blood, and then open the salon. It is business as usual. I'll take care of Penelope. What are you gonna do? The less y'all know, the better. Okay? Just go! That was close. Your silk wrap is parking! Jennifer: Oh, shit. All right, come on. Let's do this. No, no, no. You stay here and help the girls inside. What? What are you talking about? This is my shit, Ann! I got it. This just got so real, Des. Are you sure the casino is worth all this? Penelope died because of us! We're not letting Mac and Melba get away with it. Go. Go! Shit. Where your girl at? I'm only doing this for you. I know, baby. Thank you. I know it's a huge risk. She's fixing to come. There she is. Hey, Lady Di, you remember Desna. She used to visit me in lock-up. Of course. Nice to see you again. In the back. Shit! Thank you. I never seen nothing. You're the best. Mm, thank you. Hey. What's going on? I'm messing up, Pol. My gut is off. I mean, look at... Look at all that happened with Zlata and that lean in bullshit. And then somebody dropped a casino right in my lap, and I thought we was gonna walk in there like queens. But this shit's just falling down around me, and I... I can't see my way out of it. Hey. You remember when I had that meltdown at the Sarasota Kennel Club Dog Racetrack? Remember that? I had lost all my money on an Italian Greyhound named Ricardo. I was fixin' to kill myself. But you... You looked at me and you said, "Pol, I want you to close your eyes," and I want you to picture... a double rainbow."A double rainbow. Mm-hmm. You said the world can't be all bad if God made something as beautiful as that. Yeah. I was just saying that because I didn't want your ass to jump off that roof. Well, it worked! Because every time I'm in a sticky situation, I close my eyes and I just think about that double rainbow. Or check your ass into a mental institution. Well, they're both effective. The point is, you got to change how you're looking at this. You're right. We got to get this cake up on our terms. Because my black ass is not living in Quiet Ann's van. Well, that's not gonna happen. Because you know why? Double rainbow. That part. Yeah. Okay. Okay. We go back, and we let these fools think everything is fine. Mm-hmm. And then sneak attack. Love it. Now we show them they not gon' scare us away. They gon' get the message. Loud and clear. So, what's the next play? Well, Penelope said the Governor was taking bribes for something big that he's building. So I'm thinking we just got to find out what that is. Oh! They think they can keep secrets from you, Desna. Bitch, we own a casino. Whatever monies Mac and Melba are running up in through here, half of that is ours. Truth. Now, didn't you say that they were having some shindig for the Governor? Yeah. Tonight. That's what I'm talkin' about. We gon' crash that bitch and find out exactly what they asses is hidin'. Excuse me. Mac and Melba Lovestone? Yeah. Hey, thank you. Close the door on your way out, huh? "I'm so sorry for your loss." I know how much Penelope meant to you. "With deepest sympathy, Desna." Well, she did pick a lovely arrangement. Kill Desna, kill her not, Kill Desna, kill her not, Kill Desna... Remember what the therapist said about controlling your emotion, Lamby. Besides, that would bring us some unwanted attention from the Professor. I am tempted to take that chance. She's gonna get what's coming to her. Hey, baby, you remember when Daddy Bryce married me after you born, when your other daddy went away? Black Daddy. Yeah! Black Daddy. Well, uh, Black Daddy's out... Uh, back. He is back, and... He would really love to meet you, if that's something you would be interested in. Does White Daddy know? Mm-hmm. Yeah. We talked about it, and he thinks it's a great idea for you to meet EJ. His name's EJ. Is that something you think you want to do? Bree? Okay. Okay? - Breakfast burrito, chilled. - I got you, girl. Cold takeout? I like my food cold. Is there something wrong with that? Nothing, it's just... It's cute. Look, I'm not... I'm not judging. I know. That's not who you are. I'm Eric. Virginia. Oh! I, uh... Got to go. Go. Yeah. Nice meeting you. ♪ Tell me what it do, baby What it do, D? Apparently, it does a lot. You like? I like. Yeah, well, I thought I'd come by and check in with you. Heard you got a lot going on, D. You okay? I will be. What if I take you to dinner, take your mind off of it? Okay, hell has definitely frozen over, and your ass is ice-skating on it. Listen, if you want to miss all this, fine by me. It's up to you. I'm busy tonight. I've got a fundraiser to go to. But you can come by my place tomorrow night. Ooh! I get to see the new crib. I mean, seeing as how you went through all the trouble... D. I'll be seeing you at 8:00. I'll pick you up. I'll be damned. Let's do some talkin'. All right, let's talk some sense into these pillbillies. Shit, I recognize that camo neck brace. Lloyd! What you doin' here? I thought we had something. Eat shit, Clay! You ain't a dependable businessman no more. Well, that's because I woke up, Lloyd. Them days are gone. I intend to make amends for my personal contribution to the opioid crisis. Take that do-gooder bullshit some place else. Your kind ain't welcome here. I have, uh, some fliers for you. Get out of here! Okay. Oh! Shit. These animals only respond to one thing. Compassion. Opiates, boo. You know, the big "O." O.C.? Roxie Carmichael? You guys want your crusty son-of-a-guns back, you got to get them some candy, and quick. For cheap, too. Goddamn, we talked about this, boy. This... That ain't the way anymore. Toby might be right. We tell them we're selling shit half-price to lure them, and once they're at our place, we rehabilitate their asses. Yeah! So we do a little bit of bad... A little bit. But we reap a hell of a lot of good. I like your thinkin', boy. Who here wants half-priced drugs? Don't separate your tiles. It lets your opponents know when you're about ready to make a hand. It's... Pardon me? Mahjong is a game of extreme skill and strategy. I think you got the potential to really excel at it. I could teach you... Uh, is that a sexual advance? I'm engaged. No, I... I'm not hitting on you. Mac Lovestone. I'm an owner here. Dean Simms. My sister Desna is an owner, too. Prolonged eye contact makes me uneasy. Not as much as owls or commercially distressed jeans. Deanie? Oh, hey, Des. Baby, I wasn't expecting you. Oh, I'm just talking to Mac. He knows a lot about Mahjong. I'm sure he kills it. Can I talk to him alone? You don't mind, do you? Dean, look at me. Yeah. I want you to stay away from him. Why? He seems very nice. And male companionship is something I'm sorely lacking. Dean, he's dangerous. All right? I want you to go home, and I'm not playing with you. Right now. But, Des, I... What did I say? Now. I thought you said I needed a new purpose. We are here for the Governor's party. Phones. This does not sound like a fundraiser for the Governor. Damn! What the... Oh. Ooh! I love a masquerade ball. Thank you. Oh. It's thatkind of party. - You're bad. - Oh, so bad. Leave it to the Republicans to do some freaky shit with pigs. Y'all, remember why we are here and stick to the plan, ladies, okay? Find out what the Governor's building and who's bribing him. Let's do it for Penelope, y'all. Yeah, for Penelope. Shit. I know that limp. That clown is Governor Patel. If we gon' get into that room where he is, we gon' have to shed our inhibitions. All right. Let's go. Come on. Now, what would you say if I told you that in six months, you could be drug-free and living a life driven by your intentions? Wait, now how's that gonna work if the State of Florida confiscated my driver's license? - Yeah! - Hey, now, Listen. Listen, listen now! There ain't nothin' that can be overcome. Y'all just need to see the light. I believe I was brought here under false pretentiousness. Where's the half-price generic roxie I was promised? - Yeah! - Yeah! Come on, now! Calm down, folks. This isn't how we heal, all right? We're trying to heal y'all! Yeah, you know what? No, forget this. Come on, y'all. Let's go back to Peter Pain. - Yeah! - No, no, no, no, no! We're trying to heal y'all, make you better now! Whew, these bring me back. Mm, mm, mm. Does this stupid thing look like the picture? Yas, kween! Did Goldtouch get the bid? We're about to find out. I'm gonna meet Trip now. Good luck getting that contract. Want to play? In here? Sure. Why not, sugar? Mmm. We're gonna have a private party. Mmm. You not gonna make that meeting. I'll be repping Goldtouch. Thank you. Damn. I thought we knew how to party. Welcome, you beautiful freaks! Of course these psychos would be running the show. As always, tonight, we pick one lucky guest to bless the festivities! You. You're the sacrifice. Me? Did he say me? You have been chosen. No, no, no, no. You... you want me to take him? I'll... No, no, no. We now welcome the Executioner. What the hell are they doing? Executioner, are you prepared to do your duty? I am, Master. Joe? Joe, it's me. It's your cohort, Polly. Silence! Proceed. Shit. ♪ Relax, don't do it ♪ When you want to go to it ♪ Relax, don't do it ♪ When you want to come Oh, my God. These people are batshit. There goes the Governor. Let's split up. Ann, you watch our backs. ♪ When you want to come Okay. ♪ When you want to come The Governor picks you. Ah! - Thank you for your work. - You're an inspiration. - Thank you. - Thank you. You got some business with him? I'm from Goldtouch. Please tell me you're my midnight meeting. Is there some place we can talk? Ahh! Polly. Hmm? I met a cute boy today. You did? Yeah! Why are we here? What are we doing? We're trying to find out what the Governor and Mac and Melba are up to and why they keep trying to cut Desna out. Mwah! Mwah! I love you! I love you! Love you. How about we talk a little business? Glad you're into this. That's why I'm giving Goldtouch the contract. Oh, shit. Go ahead. Work your magic. Ready, baby? Oh, yeah. Oh! Oh, I love what y'all did with your last project. Well, I mean, which one? I mean, Goldtouch does so many. Alameda Corrections in Texas. Yeah. You know what they say. "Don't mess with Texas." The big house is big business. Oh, especially when it's private prisons! Oh, mama! All right. Your turn. I'mma hold off for right now. I'm actually okay. Oh, come on, now. It's... It's give-and-get, gorgeous. Yeah, well, you know, I like to take a little time to get worked up. Hey, you bring my money? You know I got your money, baby. I'mma go get it for you right now. Don't move. I ain't gonna move an inch. I like her. Ma chère! The Governor thanks you. How'd you hear about this? Oh, I have my ways. Do you, now? Uh-huh. I'm full of surprises. Like, uh... Like the two stints that I did in the nuthouse. But I've never felt better. You said you wanted to see the real Polly. Here she is. Speaking of crazy, that was quite, quite a gift that your bosses left in our salon, mister. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, I think you... No, I don't want to go! I see you. Oh, you think you special? Why... why are you being so mean to me? I... I thought pigs were supposed to be nice. Where'd you get that? That's some "Charlotte's Web" bullshit. Can I give you a hug? Put on some damn clothes. What? Au revoir ma chérie. Au revoir ma chérie. Get in here. Who... Who was that? He is from Greater Sarasota Power and Electric. I saw him make a payment. Okay, well, check this out. The Governor thought I was the woman from Goldtouch Development. Apparently, contractors have been paying him off to build private prisons. Oh! So this is where the Governor gets his bribes! No wonder Mac and Melba are cutting you out! This deal's worth millions! Yeah! They're making a lot of money lockin' up people like us. Imagine the shit everyone here would be in if this popped! That's why they killed Penelope. She ran her damn mouth. Oh, wait! Now that sounds like leverage. And we gon' secure the bag. Where's Virginia? What is wrong with y'all? Stop touching each other! Unh-unh. Unh, unh, unh! Hey! What are y'all on? Don't start rubbing me! You're shiny! Wait! Let's go. Come on. - Okay. - I love y'all so much! I know you a liar. Wait, wait. You shocked the Governor in his balls? Okay, trust, it was for a good cause. No, no, no. I'm telling y'all. Listen, we got to dream bigger. I mean, beyond the salon and franchising it. There's a lot of shit we could be doing. - You... - All right. You giving me real orange vibes. There's been a shift in your sexual aura. Ooh! Is this your eye power thing? Yeah, girl. I can see it. She ain't got no damn power. She's not wrong. I did it with a dude last night. - I know you lyin'! - I knew I smelled cock. Wait, he had a penis and everything? Why do I miss all the good parties? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - I feel that it... Your ass was supposed to be the lookout. I was! But then I saw a guy, he looked like he had information, and... In my defense, I was on something. Yeah, you was, girl. His dick. Mm! All right, all right. Wait. So you off the tuna boat now? First of all, I was married to a man. Right, right, right, right, right. Second of all, hell no. I just took a detour, and... God, I was so messed up. I was thinking I was with Arlene the whole time. Aww. You know things ain't over between the both of y'all. Unlike you and Ken, girl. Yeah, well, I need to be single, and there is no rebounding for me. Okay, that is good for you, but yo' ass... You and Arlene need to stop playing around. I mean, y'all love each other, y'all need to admit it and just go on and be together. Hmm. What? It's just... I'm getting a voicemail from pot to kettle. Me and Roller don't love each other. Mm-hmm. I mean, we goin' on a date tonight, but that ain't nothin'! - You're going on a date? - What? You know what, we're done here. A date, date? - A for real date?! - Yes! Wait till you see what he's wearing! I picked it out. I picked it out. I guess maybe... a redneck family of sociopaths ain't the right group to run a rehab, apparently. No. No, no. Don't doubt your vision. That's part of the "Get It, Get It" principles. See, you got to keep "getting it," even once you got get, you know. I mean, you get to go ahead... Hello, Clay. Hi, Bryce. Hey. Whoa, whoa! Hey! Stay away from me, Brenda. I know, I'm the last person you want to see right now, but... I got to get clean if I want to make things right with Jenn. Yeah, that ship might have sailed. On account of you blowin' this one here. Ever since that night, everything I touch turns to shit. My award-winning succulent garden at the... At the mobile home park, it... it just got decimated by slugs. I just lost my job mentoring Christian youth. I can't win. Come here, come here, come here. Sit down, sit down. I just got another DUI. Court-ordered rehab this time, the whole nine. Damn. This shit's depressing. I'm sorry you're suffering, Brenda, but I... I don't think it's healthy for you to be here at this point in time. Now, now, just hold on there, Bryce. She's a... She's a woman in need. If a woman can't turn to her family, who can she turn to? Safe Harbor Rehab, Better Days Rehab, Charlie Sheen Rehab... All right, come on. Just stay right there. Look, I know it's uncomfortable. Uncomfortable? Jenn is right next door! Yeah, but she needs us! We need our first client. So suck it up. All right, Miss Brenda. Welcome to Rock Bottom, and the rest of your life. I feel like Joe needs to zhuzh up the Baccarat room, not to... Excuse me, what are you doing here? I forgot to put my name on the door. You've got a lot of nerve, acting like you're the. Like I own the place? I do. And I'm taking over. See, I know all about the Governor taking bribes to build his shady private prisons. So you two are going to be silent partners from here on in. What makes you think we'd give in to your demands? Because if you don't, I'm gonna tell everything I know, especially the part about the two of you throwing freaky-ass sex parties for the Governor. She's the one who tied up Marsha in the closet. Desna, think about what you're saying. You'd be destroying the casino that you're benefiting from. I'd rather not. But push me. I dare you. And I will blow this bitch all the way up. Watch me. You are stepping into a world of darkness that you will not find your way out of. Look, I get that you two play dirty, but I play dirtier. I'm pulling the plug on this private prison bullshit, and if anything happens to me or anyone I love, everything I know goes to the media and the FBI. So don't even think you can step to me the way you did Penelope. Move. Looks like we underestimated you. That's the story of my life. I don't want to anymore. I want to go home. Please? Okay, well, you know, she doesn't have to do this. Hey, are you scared to meet him? I don't want to talk about it. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. You know how much I love you. And you know there's nothing in the whole wide world that could make me stop loving you? Even if you ended up liking EJ, even if you loved him. You know why? Because I chose you to be my daughter. You're not mad? No, baby girl. I'm not mad. Hey. Hey. Brienne, this is EJ. Hi, Brienne. This is for you. You know, I hear that you like swings. Yeah! You want to find out who can go the highest? Come on. It'll be okay. See you later. Bye. Just listen to me. I thought we were done. We've been doing this all wrong. Or you have. Just... Up until now, it's been "Don't ask, don't tell" with us. You don't ask about my criminal life, I don't know about your cop shit, but that doesn't work with us. You're still talking. My point is, it doesn't have to be that way. Why don't we do the opposite? Do ask, do tell. About everything. Everything? Yes. Are you insane? For example, I recently had sex with a man. How was that? I'm here, aren't I? Welcome to our new place. Take it all in. Oh, my God, Des, this is beautiful! Right? And you look bomb. Where you think you going? I'm going out with Roller. I told you, we got a date tonight. Ah! Breakin' in the new bed, huh? No, an actual date. Look, you two are gonna love this place. Deanie, it's got the dual masters we've always dreamed of. Y'all can go, get y'all shit, and move up in here tonight. What? Yeah! Oh, my God. I love you, Desna! I always have! Wait, wait. Move in? Yeah! No reason to stay at that trick-ho motel any longer, right? Yeah, girl, you right. Uh, I'm really happy for you, Desna, and this place reflects all the things that you've ever wanted, but... We can't move in. Why? Yeah, why? Because I'm... I'm my own man, Virginia, and she likes to control everything I do. Even yesterday with Mac, you told me we couldn't be friends. I like Mahjong. And you said I needed a new purpose. And he wants to teach me! Dean, I keep trying to tell you, Mac and Melba are not good people. Then you should stay away from them, too! But you won't because you want the money. Well, I want a friend, and... And I want to live with Virginia, alone. Dean, I want us to live with Des. Listen to Virginia, baby. I want you to live here. Dean, I'm still worried about you. No.I want to keep an eye on you. No, I'll say it really simply. I'd rather live in a trick-ho motel with my fiancée than live here with you. Children live with their sisters. And I'm a... I'm a man. I'm a... I'm a man. I'm a man. Let's... Virginia, let's go. Dean, please. I'm so sick and tired of the motel! It smells like feet and chicken fat and... Virginia! Virginia! Let's go! Hey, daddy. I'm talking to you, pretty boy. My car's acting up, baby.
