 money launderer in the state. I asked for a pay raise to keep doing their dirty business. Up until now, it's been don't ask, don't tell. Why don't we do the opposite? Do ask, do tell. For example, I recently had sex with a man. The governor thought I was the woman from Goldtouch Development. Contractors have been paying him off to build private prisons.

 I want you to stay away from him. And male companionship is something I'm sorely lacking. How'd you learn to play mahjong? My dad taught me. Your father teach you anything? The meaning of absence. Hi, Desna! We took your lover! This partnership with you, not working out. You're gonna sign over your interest in the casino. Otherwise... Your lover dies.Shit. I thought you was gon' die out there. I think I love you, Roller. Do my doctorin' on you. Hey! Easy, D. Stop acting like a... What's up? Crybaby. You know you like pain. Hey. Savage, D. That's why you the boss. I ain't the boss of that much these days. Let me see. I do want to get my franchise shit together, though. That's what you were about to do till you got lost in the sauce. I don't know. I just think that... maybe I just want to chill for a little bit. Yeah. Me too, babe. Just lay up in the cut. You know what I was thinking, too? What was you thinking? You see them drapes right there? We trade those in for some leather Versace drapes. We could classy up this spot. Um... We who? Who is we? Right there. No, no, no. But who is we? You and me, me and you... we. What? Okay. D, all the shit we been through. Come on, girl. Plus, I'm already here. I'm lamped up here for how long? Give me your hand. See? I'm thinkin', baby. I think you should pump the brakes. It was just, what, less than two years ago, we was trying to bury each other, and now you want to be all up in here livin' in sin? D, why you got to bring up old shit for? Roller, every man in my life has disappointed me, failed me, and left me, starting with my damn daddy. D, first of all, I ain't every man, and I'm certainly not your daddy... unless you want me to be, baby. I love you, but I got to be sure that you are really down for me before I start splitting rent and shit. I mean, I don't know how you live. Do you even use Lawry's? What? Do you? Bullshit, D. You gonna need help paying rent. Roller, hold up. Well, I'm jHey, y'all. Hey, boo. Hey, girl. Mac and Melba sent food again. Every day this week. Stale-ass onion bagels. "Enjoy the food. Stay away from us, and we'll stay away from you." Throw it in the trash. Look, we need to keep our asses out of Bayside and just pretend like this casino shit never happened. Yes, ma'am. We do... We do not need to... To go back there. No way. Unh-unh. I know we got bills to pay. I'ma figure out another way to take care of y'all. In other news, Roller wants to move in. What? This is a bad idea, right? No! I say go for it. Me and Arlene already moved in Tuesday night. What? Damn, y'all nest quick. Well, maybe Roller's a lesbian, 'cause his ass is picking out drapes already. Girl, that boy, he has real feelings for you. Roller is on some Drake shit. I don't got time for no real feelings, especially not after what happened with Ruval. Des, Roller is hardly Ruval. They're both men. Let the church say "Amen." Amen. Sounds like someone has daddy issues. Okay, this is crazy 'cause me and Roller was just beefin' about that this morning. 98% of trust issues come from bad dads, according to Teen News. Teen News. I read that same thing. Paternal abandonment is the original sin of commitment-phobic women. Heffa, your ass read it, too? It was in the break room. Girl, we all got dad shit. For instance, my dad left my mom for a janitor at a dialysis clinic. He sure knows how to pick 'em. Des, your dad... Your real dad... he's a... He was a junkie, right? Not anymore. He's a big-time architect. I've been keeping tabs on him for years now. Do what? Why didn't you tell us? I haven't told anybody, not even Dean. Well, listen, tiny secret, maybe now it's time for you to reach out. Think about it, Des. Once I gave my dad a piece of my mind, it really freed me. Ain't gon' happen. This ain't "On Golden Pond." What kind of reference is that? That Roller is your knight in shining ar-ar-armo-r-r, Desna. Hey, so, you living here now? You look a hot mess. Why don't you come home? I've got the fridge stocked with kombucha. Virginia, push-ups bring oxygen to my brain, which helps me stay focused. O-Okay, but you've been up in here every night this week. D-Don't exaggerate. Here's your açai smoothie, Dean. 10:00 a.m. on the dot. Thanks, Julio. First-name basis? Isn't it great? Mac set me up with everything I need. Okay, but, hey, look, what about what weneed? What about our relationship? Virginia, we have a perfectly functional relationship. You have more of a relationship with Julio. Don't you love me anymore? Yeah, of course I love you. Virginia, you're being pathologically needy. There. Okay. I'm ready. Good luck. So, when you get that lil' itch in your noggin, you can resist by using principle number five... Get busy with something else. What about when you're vom-aching, when you're aching all over and you're sweating like a broken levee? Still number five... get busy! Hell, clean up the yard, pick up them old car parts, that moon-moonshine kit you know y'all got, and stay occupied. Idle hands are the opiate-lover's playground, am I right? Now, we are out of time, but, got a little bonus for y'all. Hot off the presses, autographed by yours truly. I'm available for book readings, signings, you know, corporate team building, what have you. You can get your copy over there on the... Zaddy, you're here!...table over there. Hey, Toblerone. Is that a little girl's bathing suit? Don't be jelly. Hold up. I-I thought we agreed she couldn't be here. Come on, Bryce, don't get your panties in a wad, alright? She's a desperate soul that needs some help. Where's your compassion? Hiding with my nuts in case Jenn finds out. Look, I'm no fool, alright? It's either her or me in this rehab. Come on, now. I can't turn my back on this, angel. Oops. Now, listen here. Bryce, I'ma give you an ultimatorium, okay? You make it work with Brenda here or you can "Get It, Get It" somewhere else. Fine. I quit. Good luck when Jenn bombs the shit out of this place. Come on, now, Bryce! We're right here, a-a Husser family breakthrough! Come on! Shit. Thank you, Clay. Did you mean it when you called me an angel? I sure did. You remind me of my poor, dead wife, Juanda. Bless her soul. Except for the dead part. Well, yeah, yeah. You're alive. Well, you are a good, strong, decent man. And that makes you a rare treasure. Thank you. And I know someone real good who can replace Bryce. Hey, V, make sure the other ones are extra spicy. Yeah. Hey. What's up, baby? D, my bad about this morning. I was trippin'. I'ma pump the brakes. We good. Okay? It's probably just my trust-issue baggage bullshit. Shit. We all got those Louis Vs, baby. The girls at the salon was trying to say they felt all my issues stem from the fact that my pops left me and that if I just talked to him, all my trust issues would just... poof... Be worked out. That's that white people shit, D. Let the healing begin. What you think? You gon' do it? I feel some type of way. I mean, he probably don't want to talk to me. Probably all bougie now, dating white women and shit. Could be good for Deanie, though. Just sayin'. What kind of man does that? How you dip on your family, get put on, and never look back? I hear you, D. But if I had an opportunity to speak to my pop again, I'd take it. I'ma call you. 10 stores in a week. Not too shabby. I love the smell of extortion in the morning. As long as Mac and Melba don't find out. Yeah, or Desna, for that matter. Ooh, baby. Take out your dick. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. You know, I still have no idea who the real Polly Marks is. Careful what you wish for. No, no, no, no, no. Seriously. I want to know. When I'm with you, I don't feel so broken. That scares the crap out of me. That's for little ol' me? I'm falling for you, Polly girl. Excuse me. Is Calvin Simms here? Yes, ma'am. Right over there. Thanks. Calvin Simms? Yes? Nice building. Thank you very much. Is there something I can help you with? Ooh, I... Ooh, I had a whole speech. You... really don't recognize me? Should I? I'm your daughter... Desna. Can we talk about this some other time? Can we talk about it another time? I mean, I'm here now wanting to talk to you about me and Dean and... Now, you... you... You can't just come by my job and drop this on me. I have imagined this moment for so long. And I feel stupid for ever wanting anything from you. Well, I can't do this now. Please leave. Alright, fellas. What do you say we move upstairs? Dean, I nee... I need you to call me back, okay? I saw someone today and, um... Shit. Ju... Just call me. Mahjong, again. Well done, Dean. It's amazing how far you've come. I've got something for you. Okay. My grandfather gave this to my father who gave it to me. Before your father kicked you out? Yeah. I was his favorite until I dropped out of med school. This is real nice. Real ivory? Yeah. Excuse me. Can you give us a minute? Yeah. What? Why are you still working that man-turtle? He was just supposed to be our way into Desna. But we don't need him anymore. Dean is a sweet kid, and he's an amazing mahjong player. You can't keep picking up strays. What would the Professor say about this latest protégé? Professor can just relax. If Dean becomes a big player, he's gonna bring in a lot of customers. This isn't about revenue and you know it. Why can't you put your attention on something productive, like your school? There's time for that. You're hittin' that a little heavy lately, aren't you? Pick someone else. Don't re-engage Desna. Let me see. Work it, bitch! Yes. Alright, I'ma see you at Essence Fest, okay? Yeah, and make sure you bring your shea butter and dro because you know how we do. This is quite a tan you got going. Yas, queen! And you know the 'Gram can't get enough of this mocha choco-late, ya, ya. You should get tips from Rachel Dolezal about welfare fraud. What's her tag? So, your... your mama came by the rehab today. Well, please tell me you steered clear of that hatchet-faced skank. I can smell Jean Naté from here. I knew it. Yeah, no, of course. Team Jenn all the way. I just... told Uncle Daddy I'm just not gon' work there anymore. Well, that's the least you could do, baby. I said I quit a job I love for you. I don't know what you want me to do, babe. You want a piece of ass for doing the right thing? Okurr, bitch. Yeah, girl. We trappin' in these streets tonight, biatch. I'm keeping it 100 with these niglets. Unh-unh! No, no, no, girl. Come on. You know that you my straight-up main nig... No, bitch! You gots to go. Hey! Jennifer! I just have to. I really do. Hello?! Is anybody seeing this?! It's a wrap on that minstrel show. Hey! Hey! Watch my tracks! Don't struggle. White people are just really on one. If it's not that hooker, it's Melba with her... papoose or Roller, my white-chocolate brother-in-law doing the absolute most. And we... Well, I did slick down my baby hairs today and... Well, they're edge... And what I... Am I a part of the problem? Am I doing it? I'm... I'm one of 'em. I'm doing it. Kinda. But we invite you to the cookout, girl. Okay. Guess who saw their father today. And his ass act like he didn't even know me. Babe, I am so sorry. That's his loss then. Girl, I mean, the hell with him. Des, I don't know how to tell you this, but your brother's been living at the casino. This negro thinks he's in "The Joy Luck Club" and won't stop playing mahjong. Lord. Dean's doing it, too. Okay, he told me he was gon' keep his ass out of there. Well, girl, he lied. He's a mahjong crackhead. You know, Teen Newssays... Shut up. Bryce. Mnh-mnh. I know what you and Joe have been doing. Excuse me? The money y'all are extorting from shops around town. Whatever do you mean? I wonder what Mac and Melba would say about that. Not to mention Desna. Okay, what do you want? I want what's mine. You already took Joe. You had a thing with Joe? I had thething with Joe. You understand how hard that is to find? He told me I was his cocoa-baby girl. Aren't you a little old for baby girl? Hey! And then at the drop of a dime... poof, gone! Ever since you came around with your pasty white-boy ass. You have 24 hours to cut me in on your little side hustle or I'm blowing your shit up! You can't be here, Ms. Simms. Kiss the dark side of my ass. Where's my brother? Dean is happy here. What the hell do you even know about Dean? I know that he resents you for trying to control his life. Now, please leave unless you want to get thrown out. Believe me, this is the... last place I want to be. And when my brother finds out that you tried to murder me, he ain't gon' want to be up in here either. Well, good luck on convincing him. What is the deal with you and Dean? I mean, you already got the casino. You won. Yeah, I know. That's why you're still alive. Lucky girl. Stay away from my brother. Get off of me. I'm not going anywhere. And good luck on getting him to. Get her out of here. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Get off of me. Dean, please call me back. Okay, Mac and Melba are not good people, Dean. They hurt people. They tried to kill me. You got to get out of there. Des. What? There's somebody here to see you. Hi, Desna. How did you find me? Well, the same way you found me, I guess. I owe you an apology. Unh-unh. We good. But you can get your deadbeat ass out of my salon. Look, you caught me off guard. I have been dreading that moment for decades. Wow. Wow! That's not what I-I meant. What I meant to say is I panicked. I'm sorry I put you out. How you think we felt when your black ass walked out on us? What I... What I was trying to say... No, no, no. No, no, no. Do you have any idea what it was like for me and my brother? You left, Lola went to jail. We was... We was in one shitty foster home after the next, not able to trust people, and all the while thinking this shit was our fault. And... Why are you here? For the longest time, I tried to pretend like you didn't exist. Now, look. I don't know how this is supposed to go, but I'm trying. Can you meet me halfway? So I cracked his head open with a canoe oar, then I fed his ferret to his pet alligator. The next day, the son of a bitch called the cops. Well, the problem is, you still love him. No. I despise my son. Okay, the opposite of love isn't hate. It's indifference. You have to let go of your anger if you want to get over the situation and get clean. Amen, sister. Thank you for bringing Ricki Lake over. We needed a good counselor since Bryce left. I got you. It's the least I could do for driving him off. She's got a real gift. Yeah, that she do, and I knew that. Can't believe I didn't think about this myself. Well, you've got a lot of things on your mind. I don't know what to say. One year becomes five and then 10, then 20. I'm sorry I never tried to find you. Where was your sorry when Lola left us alone while she was out smoking rocks? I was addicted, too. I wasn't good for anybody, least of all you two. I-I-I been divorced twice, never had any more kids. I can't promise you any kind of magical reunion, you know, but I would like to get to know you and your brother. If it's not too late. Well, Dean is not speaking to me right now. So you're on your own with that. You can find him at the mahjong tables, Bayside Rapture. Shoot your shot. Excuse me, ma'am. This area is off-limits to... Polygon, what are you... It's dangerous for you to keep showing up. You need to be careful coming back here. I know. That's why I'm dressed like a Golden Girl at the penny slots. I just had a run-in with Yolanda. Were y'all together? Yola... That was... Look, it was nothing. Okay? Trust me. Well, it must have been something to her because she's been following us around, and she knows all about our little scam. What? Yeah. She wants a cut. And if I don't give it to her, she's gonna rat us out to everybody, Joe. Yeah, Yolanda squawks really loud, okay, but she's not a threat at all. She's just jealous. She pushed me down. You have nothing to worry about. It's nothing. You sure? Promise. Welcome, everyone, to day one of Bayside's Mahjong Mayhem. If everyone will please find a table, play will begin in 30 seconds. This seat available? Yes. But be warned, I'm very good. Noted. What I love about architecture is everything has a plan, everything has a place and a purpose. All the angles fit. I-I used to draw houses. It's much easier than people because they... They... they don't move. My sister took me to all the nice neighborhoods in Sarasota to let me sketch. You know, rich white people don't usually like it when you're near their house, but it's helpful if you have a sketchpad. You see that guy at the table with Dean? I want to know all about him. We should have his credit card on file. I'm on it. What houses did you draw? Um, The Ringling. Um, we would go up and down Bayshore. The Sarasota Contemporary Art Institute was my favorite. Mahjong! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! You dis... You distracted... You distracted me! Dean? It's okay. We can go grab a bite to eat now that the game is over. Talk about Sarasota. No, no, no, no, no, no. I have ano... I have another game I have another game to play. I have another game. I-I think you should take a break. I don't... I don't take breaks! Thank you very much for the conversation. Um, I have to focus now. Thank you. Thank you for the conversation. I have to focus. Are you ok... Yes! I... Please, please. I'm sorry. Don't... Don't touch me, please. Please don't touch me. Thank you. Okay, so let me get this straight. You quit and now you're mad that Virginia's up in there working her magic? Magically magic. She ain't qualified. Okay? Just... You know, there is a world of difference... A world of difference... Between fortune cookie sayings and deep down counseling that comes from four hours of online coursework at Palmetto Junior College. It should be me in there. So tell Uncle Daddy you want your job back. But my hands are tied as long as Brenda's in there. Just... So fix the problem with Jenn and Brenda and go claim what's yours. Ooh. Y'all, I got to run. I just... I... I totally forgot I have a colonic today. So sorry. Didn't you just get a colonic? It's a vicious cycle. I got you. Sweep! Finish this up. Wow. Would you look at that. A-A-A-Another chow. Mahjong. Yeah. Mahjong. Hey... hey, Denise. Thank you. Hey. Sorry. Hey, Desi. Hey, Desi. Baby, we need to talk. Now is not a good time. No, no, now. Listen, Dean, you remember Calvin? Yeah. He's the reason I lost my last game, yes. Okay, well... Dean, look at me. Hey, hey, hey. Calvin is our father. Well, tha... that's... That's impossible. Ou... Our fa... Our father's... Father's a drug addict that you said is probably dead in a ditch somewhere. Well, Dean, this is him. Mmmmm. Dean, you can't be so distracted by this game that you don't want to meet your father. I don't want to talk about this, Des! Shh! Dean, Dean. What if I told you that I could get us a-a private tour of the Sarasota Contemporary Arts Institute? We could have the whole place to ourselves. Would that interest you at all? But that's... that's... That's been closed for years. Nobod... Nobody has access to that. I do. My firm did the restoration to the building. They did restoration to the... I don't mean to rush you, baby, but we got to get the hell out of here now. Come on. I'll bring you back.O-O-O-Okay. Okay, everybody. I'm gonna visit a neoclassical landmark. But... But I'll... But I'll be back! Six months, hard work. Finally, we're done. Wait, wait, wait. 26 grooves each column. You... you count the grooves, too? Well, who doesn't? Well... Well, no one else I know. I'm... I'm... I'm always the... I'm always the only one. It's just me. I-I don't... I don't like to be... I don't like to be touched. Um, did you know... Did you know... Did you know that people unfairly grouped this design in with the Neo-colonial Movement? Yeah, you're right. Yeah, but I-I think it has more to do with Greek Revival. Well, that's exactly what I wrote on my graduate thesis. Where do you stand on Le Corbusier? I-I'm more of a Mies van der Rohe man myself. Yes. Speaking my language. This is just like old times. I know you lyin'. We ain't had no old times. No, no, no. Alright, no, that's fair enough. That's fair enough. But I've got to say, I am amazed at how well the two of you have done for yourselves. That must have taken a tremendous amount of strength. I'm so proud of both of you. Des... Desi. Desi. I-I-I have... I have to get back to the game. Dean... I-I have to get back to the game. Dean, take it from me. I-It's great to love something, but you can't let that control your life. I'm not smoking crack. I'm just playing mahjong, Calvin. And... And... And I can walk away at any time. We hard... We hardly even know you. You can't give me any advice. Dean, stop it. But he can't... Hey, no, he's right. He's absolutely right. But how 'bout we take this time to get to know each other? There's a dedication ceremony here tonight. I'd love it if you two would be my guests. Why don't you let us think about it? Take it in baby steps. Of course, we... We got to take our time. I-I have to go back. I have to go back to the game. What? Look at you being all domestic. Hey, D, don't be mad at me, but... Look at these. They shrunk. No. That's the size it's supposed to be. How was your day with your pop? It was really nice. See what happens when you listen to me, D? Okay, I admit it. It was cool hanging out with Calvin. Roller, let's do it. Shit, let's do it, baby. What? I'm not talking about sex. I'm talking about me and you. I want you to move in here. For real? For real, for real. As long as you gon' go half on these bills. Yeah. Since I'm not at the casino anymore. 50/50, baby. I see O.G. Calvin talked some sense into you? I used to think people couldn't change, but I was wrong. So I want to give shackin' up a shot. Hello, Calvin. I-I'm sorry. You are? I want you out of Dean's life for good. You bribin' me? If you love Dean as much as I do, you will take this deal. Hello? Yoo-hoo? Yolanda? Hello? It's me. It's, - It's Polly. Hey, girl, hey. Got... I got what you asked for. Hello? Think back to your childhood, to your early dreams. Where's the cheesecake? What? Did they get all eaten? Baby, you said there was gon' be cheesecake. Nice work. What's going on? Hell no. What? Is this some kind of intervention? Absolutely not. No, no, no. Jenn, Jenn. Bryce, get out of my way. Come on, just give us five minutes, alright, please. One. You get one. Principle number seven of "Get It, Get It"... Final Solution... "Get It, Get It!" is "Get past the past." We all want to wipe the slate clean for ourselves, so why don't we just do it. Why not, I say? I mean, ju... just do it. We can all be reborn when we stop drinking the poison for other people's crimes. Whoo! Reborn! Just like a shiny new baby. You know, re... You know... "Get It." So do it for yourself, but, hey, do it for the people around you, too. Please, baby. Try not to think of me as a dirty whore. Okay, well, why don't you try not to act like one. Hey, hey, hey.Virginia. She just swoops right in. Look at me. I'm lookin'. Your mama's betrayal brings you back to the first time you were truly hurt. Am I right? Okay. Um, yeah. Um, when I was in the second grade, I gave this boy that I loved a special valentine, and, um, he, like, called me fat and he said I had scarecrow hair and he, um, said I smelled like wet dogs. And then he and his friends, um, spit on me. And they made me watch while they flushed it down the toilet. I remember that little punk. His name was Johnny Marshall. Yeah. It was Johnny Marshall, and you really, um, beat his ass the next day. Well, he deserved it. She still loves you. I do. So much. Feel the energy. Please, baby, can you forgive me even just a little? Mama... Mama. Get in there, boy. Come on, get in. Get. Go get it. Get it. No, I'm not... "Get It, Get It." That son of a bitch didn't take the money! Sugar plum, sugar plum. Honey, how can I make it better? I want Dean all to myself! Ask and you shall receive. You make my world sparkle. Hey, Polly-amorous. What's the matter? I just came from Yolanda's. She was hanging from the doorway like a sack of potatoes. Joe, do you know anything about that? I knew she was battling with depression. This isn't a total surprise. And Penelope? You remember her? Was she also depressed? How sad. How very, very sad. So, you know I could never hurt you, right? I bet you say that to all the girls. Polly, it's me. How many people have you killed? You really want to know? So, if anyone gets in your way, they're just gone? It's not like that. What happens if I get in your way? Pol... No, don't. Don't. Butterfingers. Here, let me help. You're too kind... Cat daddy. "Cat daddy." Damn, D, this is pretty dope. Your dad did all this? Crazy, right? Virginia, what? Just happy to see you outside of the casino. It's been a while. It gives me great pleasure to introduce the man behind all this wonder, our captain as it were, the talented man whose reinvention of our local art institute will be appreciated by generations to come. Mr. Calvin Simms. Calvin? Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Um... I'm... so... I'm so humbled. I'm so humbled by your generosity, and... No, I-I-I'm... I'm both generous and humble. What was it? What was it? - What's wrong with him? - Shit. I think he's high. I thought you said he had his addiction under control, Desi. I thought he did. Are you okay? I'm gonna be sick. Okay, I-I-I can't... Um, I got to... I got to... I-I can't. Um, I... because I... Shh. It's okay. Let's go.! Okay. Shit. Dean. Shit. You okay? You want to talk about your dad? No. I-I-I do... I do not. I-I have successfully compartmentalized my feelings and will process them at a different time. Okay, well, why can't you process them with me? I'm actually really good at this. E-E-Excuse me. I have to get to level four of a mahjong tournament. Could you... Could you drive faster, please? We are not going back to the casino. It's late. Dean, please... Can we just go back to the motel and we can get our Anita Baker on, okay? I will give you the best I got. E-E-Either take me to the casino or pull over so I can get my own Lyft, okay? Okay? Okay? Dean, really? Dean! Dean, please! Shut up and move! You shut up! Stupid bitch. Ann, hurry up! You missin' my story! I'll be there in a second! He told me he was off the shit. I know. You know, that's the reason why I didn't want to reach out to his ass in the first place. Yeah, I hear you. Open you heart to somebody, and then they just stomp all over it. Ann, what's going on? You okay? Actually... Hey. What happened last night, that wasn't my fault. That's exactly what dopeheads say. It's not what you think. Ooh, they say that shit, too. No, somebody did something to me. Hear me out, okay? There was something I didn't tell you because I didn't know if it was connected or not, but some fella from the casino offered me money to stay away from Dean. Mac. What the hell does that have to do with what happened last night, Calvin? You threw up on my shoes and shit! I'm sorry. And I... And I don't know. All I know is I told the guy to get lost, then I stop in some... Some diner, and somebody must have dusted me there. Somebody like who, Calvin? I don't know. I was having a cup of coffee before I went to the event, then all of a sudden, I was out of my damn mind. There was this... This weird lady. I helped her. She... Whoa, whoa. When you say, "weird," Calvin, weird how? She had emphysema or something. Shit. Did... Did she... Did she have a little oxygen tank? Yes. I know who did this to you. Calvin, I am so sorry. None of this is your fault. And I hate that I got you mixed up in all this. Mixed up in all of what? What kind of shit are you into? Dean, I am trying to tell your black ass that Mac and Melba ain't no good! No one forced Calvin to take drugs. He was tricked. Dean, they dosed him. W-What's m-more believable? That someone secretly slipped him drugs or that an addict relapsed? M-Mac has been more of a father to me than Calvin ever was... Ev... ever, ever was! Ever! I-I won. De... Shit! Hey, hey. D, D, what's doing on? First, they dose Calvin, and now they got Dean. Who? Mac and crazy-ass Melba? Roller, they messed with the wrong bitch. First, they try to kill us, and now they turnin' my family against me? It's my damn family, and I am done with this shit. D, what you gon' do? Run up in there like you're Rambo? Watch me.
