I'm glad Mr. Joshi has chosen me to serve Aryavarta. Show of hands, who wants to see a magic trick? Here comes the magic trick! Wow! In my vision of our future, there is great progress. Everyone has clean water to drink, and fresh air to breathe, where there is no pollution, where the heat does not scorch you, nor does the cold freeze you to death. And it rains, whenever you want it to. A place where you control the weather. The Skydome will be a shield, born out of progress. And then, we will be masters of the skies, even the stars will belong to us. How did he started crying so suddenly? - Take him home. - Okay. - Give him some fruit. - Okay. Don't cry, my baby.

First, the camera will record, then, we'll find him. You won't find anything on the camera. Tell that to your people. - And why's that? - Because I have what they want. And what is that? What do you have? A package. - A package? - Yeah. What package? What do you mean? First, Tahiruddin. Let's go. Madhu, let go of me! Get your hands off me. Let go of me! If you weren't my friend, I'd have finished you off right now. I would have also... Look. Don't ruin this friendship. Bring me the package. I didn't know you could kick ass. You better watch out. What are you doing here? Getting some air. Got enough air? Get out of here. Next time you want some air, stay in your room. All right? Shalini. What do you mean you didn't get it? That girl was right there. She was supposed to take it. You've dropped me in it! Of course I'm going to worry! Sir? Keep them in my room. Wait. Give them to me. What's that? Yes, I put it there. Restricted access. Authorization required. Shalini. Answer the door. - Who is it? - Yes? Yes? Oh! Mr. Shrivastava. - Hail Aryavarta! - Welcome. Get them some water, quick. And put the kettle on, quick. How are you, Mr. Shrivastava? Such a beautiful child. How are you doing, madam? How have you been? Is Mr. Dixit at home? He's taking a shower. He said he has to get to work early today. He's always working. He has no time left for us. You've taken him away from us. Not quite yet. Right now, we have a big problem. There's a lot of preparation left to do, for the inauguration of the Skydome. Of course. And there are so many... enemies to deal with. Oh, Mr. Shrivastava. Ready? I was about to come to you. I thought I'd come get you instead. At least have a glass of water. Shall we? Water? Put the damn kettle on! How about some juice? - Something to eat? Tea is almost ready. - Next time. Hail Aryavarta! Love you. They'll take my child away! Hello? They took him away. What? Where? I'll be there. I won't give him to you! I won't give him to you! Prasad is my son. I won't let go of him! I... I won't give him to you. So what if I didn't give birth to him? I'm giving him a good life. I'll never give him up. Prasad is my son. What do you mean? Whose child is this? Who are his parents? I don't know. I never asked them. Whom didn't you ask? The people I bought him from. You bought a child? Buy him as in... Not like that... I'd gone there for IVF. I tried many times to conceive. And then they said... They had an entire list of mixed kids, and I fell in love with him. So they sell mixed children. And you bought him. Did you ever bother to ask... who his parents are? What difference would it make? If we hadn't bought him, they would have sent him away to Project Balee. We saved him. You saved him for your selfish reasons. If you had let him be... you never know, his mother would have been able to see him. She must be searching desperately for him. Prasad... Did you ever bother to ask what his mother had named him? Did you? Where did you buy him from? Where the hell did you buy him from? Singh's Fertility Clinic... Crystal Plaza. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please help me. Mama. Mama. Give me the keys. Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama. - Let's go. - Mama. - Mama. - Let's go. Mama. HAIL ARYAVARTA - Mama. - It's okay, Prassu. Mama, Daddy. Mama. Mama. It's all right. - It's all right, Prassu. - Daddy. Mama. Thank you. Let's go. What if they force Chaitanya to tell the truth about Prasad? Mrs. Dixit... I need to extract your chip. Where are you going? I spilled some milk in the bag, I need to wash it out. Keep the door open. Okay. Madam, this will burn you. That's it! It's over! Calm down, sweetheart. She's coming with us. Take the next left turn. Turn off the engine. Thank you, Shalini. Let's go. Wait in the car. Sorry, Shalini. You know far too much now. Subtitle translation by Priyadarshini Basu
