 Bhanu, please. Please don't shoot. Please! How is this my fault? I was just helping you guys. You asked me to install the camera in Mr. Dixit's room. How is that my fault? Who asked you to install the camera? Madhu. Think before you speak, Shalini. I told Madhu about Mr. Dixit's package. That was Aryavarta you were working for.

 Everything is because of Mr. Joshi's guidance. WATER IS PROHIBITED FOR DOOSH Take the next exit to Commercial Sector. Ten minutes to Crystal Plaza. Where are you going? Crystal Plaza. Madam has sent me. It closes in half an hour. Okay. Show me your hand. Hello! Hello? Anyone! My cutie! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Leila! Leila! Leila! Leila! Leila! Leila! What will you do now, Shal? He's the same man. Leila is with him. We'd be together today if he hadn't done this to us. I'll go back tomorrow morning. I'll get him to tell me where Leila is. And then I'll kill him. Look, Mama, lights. Hey! Who is it? What are you doing here? Whose car is it? Come on, step out! Hail Aryavarta, sir. - What are you doing here this late? - Madam asked me to wait here. - Who is your employer? - Mr. Dixit, Ashwin Sector. - Hail Aryavarta. - Hail Aryavarta. - She works for the Dixits. - Take the car to the police station. - Okay, sir. - Whose car did Mrs. Dixit escape in? I don't know, sir. I... Madam just said... - She said to wait here. - Hail Aryavarta. Hail Aryavarta. - Are you her manager? - Yes. Sir, what's the crime? Illegal parking and waiting. Penal code 607. Driving without license, penal code 1425. Your thumbprint here. You too. There is a CCTV and chip-tracking requisition under your name. But sir, I only did what my boss asked me to. Bring her to the station day after tomorrow. Hail Aryavarta. Hail Aryavarta. Hail Aryavarta. LABOR CAMP Category 5. - You had a close shave. - Yes. I did. So did you. Do you know what's in that package? No. I don't want to know either. What do you care whether others live or die, right? Where is the package? On the moon. Go find it. Just a while ago, you were about to shoot me. But I didn't, did I? - The next time, I certainly will. - Will you find the package that way? Take me to the Commercial Sector, early tomorrow morning. Then, I'll give you the package. They've called us in the day after tomorrow, right? If something happens to me, you're in big trouble too. Madhu... Shalini! You were amazing! You helped catch Dixit. You did well. Did you bring the package? I have to be at the Commercial Sector at 8 a.m. tomorrow. I need your job. Why? I found Tahiruddin. Really? Now tell me. How can I get your job? As soon as we get the job cards tomorrow, you can sit in my vehicle. We can swap our cards then. What if someone recognizes us? Shoot them. Shalini, we're from the labor camp. Who'd care to look at us? Come on. Hey! Wake up! Everyone! - Come on, get up! - Wake them up! Why are they screaming? What happened, sir? Get up! What are you doing, sir? - What happened? - They don't even let us sleep. - Come on! - What's the emergency? - Hey! Come on, move! - Hurry up! - What are you doing? - Get up! - Get up! - Move it! - Why are you harassing us? - Come out! Check upstairs! - Move it! - Come on, move it! Hurry up! - Hey, you come here! - Wake her up! Check under that. Leave your things! Get up. Come on, get up! Stand up! Do you think I'm stupid? We've found all the stuff. It was stashed under Madhu's bed. Sir... I made a mistake, I'm sorry! - Seize her driving license. - No! Please don't do that, sir! From now on she'll chip rocks at the construction site. Sir, give me any other job. Don't send me away, please! - You shouldn't have done it. - It was a mistake. Take her away. - Sir, please! Please don't send me away! - Come on, move! - Sir! - Move it! Please don't do this! Sir, don't send me away! Sir! That's it for today. - Move it! - Go back to bed. Get back to your rooms, quick! - Back to your rooms, come on. - Move it! Hail Aryavarta. This is the bus number 13 departing from Center 28. This bus will go to Siddhi Sector via Gupta and Bant Sector. Check your duty card to confirm... Sudha, Commercial Sector. Next. Shalini, Bant Sector, home care. Go on. - Jahnvi. - Hey, Sudha. - Come. - Yes. We're late, hurry up. Hey, what happened? Are you hurt? - Here. - Thank you. Hurry up! - Let's go? - Hurry up! Come on! You carry on. Get in! I forgot something. I'll be there. Get in! Get in, quick! LABOR CAMP Hey, get off. - What is it? - Report to Mr. Bhanu. There is no shame in labor. You are fortunate to get this opportunity. Ruined your plan, did I? What do you think? You can't stop me. You still have a choice. Where's the package? Get me to the Commercial Sector. Then you'll have your package. Your sole duty is to serve Aryavarta. Fine. Let's go. No, I mean... I'm sorry. Get in. So sorry... I'm late. Never mind. Get in. Leaving without me? No, Ms. Hemal. I'd never leave you behind. Come on, let's go. Hail Aryavarta. This is Ashwin Sector. Come on. Entry without permission is prohibited. Trespassers will be punished. Keep your belongings with you. Random searches are conducted. Put your belongings here. Get in line. Make an entry. There are nine of them. Mr. Rao. It's the fourth anniversary of Aryavarta. What is your opinion on this matter? Look, a council... A council... is like a fist. All five fingers aren't equal. "...five fingers aren't equal." What does that make Mr. Joshi? "What does that make Mr. Joshi?" Yay! What does the thumb do? It has the power to anoint. But true power... Does it lie in this? Or this? Hail Aryavarta! Hail Aryavarta! So what kind of weaklings have you brought me? I don't want new people here every day. They'll stay here for seven days. Have you explained them their jobs? Yes, sir. There should be no mistakes. Or I'll have your contract cancelled. Hail Aryavarta. That... That man from this morning... Mohan Rao? He's from Mr. Rao's hometown. Claims to be his nephew. Do we really have to stay here for seven days? Yes. Why? I have to be somewhere tomorrow morning. Go later. I've got to go tomorrow. What would they do even if I ran away? They'll hang you in public. I saw it once. The tongue was lolling out. Like this. - Shut up! - Hey! What's going on here? Work quietly. Mr. Rao demands perfection in everything. The handle of the teacup should face him. Where's the sugar? It was right here. I didn't see it. I'll go get some more. Mr. Joshi is something else. You must've heard about the Skydome engineer. These days walls don't just have ears, they have tongues too. Mr. Joshi handpicked him from America. The nation's most important project was handed over to a traitor. Mr. Joshi lacks experience. Your tea, sir. Sorry, sir! It was a mistake, sir. Sorry. The china cup was a souvenir of Mr. Rao's Chinese trip. Who will pay for it? It won't happen again, sir. Take her away. Replace her. Right away! Okay, sir. - Hail Aryavarta. - Hail Aryavarta. I must admit, Category 5. You're not stupid. Are we in agreement? First Commercial Sector, and then the package? Fuck! Stay in the car. Hands on the steering wheel. Motherfuckers! Secret Service Police. What now? They must've found the footage. Don't tell them anything. You get out. Who's that? Speak up. It's you, right? - Yes. - And that? That’s Mrs. Dixit. Whose kid is that? Mrs. Dixit's. Who's that? Speak up. That... I have no idea. If you know something, tell us now. Do you know the penalty for lying, in Aryavarta? You stay here. HAIL ARYAVARTA Hail Aryavarta. This is the worker from Dixit's. Who was the guy wearing the cap? I don't know, sir. The footage from the camera in front... Did you see it? Sir, that's not in Aryavarta. We had put a camera there, they stole that one, too. Who did you go to meet at the lodge? - Surely you know that. - I don't know, sir. I was told to wait in the lobby downstairs. We left after that. We had installed a camera. At Dixit's place. Why did you remove it? Camera? I put the camera there. And once the job was done, I removed it. Investigate this. Yes, sir. You're the one who said that I placed the camera for Aryavarta. The Aryavarta police have foiled an assassination attempt on Mr. Joshi. Shalini, be... According to sources, the terrorist was headed to Mr. Joshi's residence, in a vehicle loaded with explosives, when the police intercepted him. The terrorist tried to abandon the car and escape, but he was caught on the spot. They won't spare us either. The Central Council has expressed concern over this incident. It remains to be seen how this incident affects Mr. Joshi's re-election. Don't change your testimony. A terrorist attempted an attack on Aryavarta, and was caught. Everyone saw it, on TV, on the news. You heard it too. But apart from this, you know nothing. You never placed a camera. Did you? Forget about everything else. - Or else... - It's forgotten, sir. Okay? Hail Aryavarta. Hail Aryavarta. - Hail Aryavarta, sir. - Hail Aryavarta. Shalini. Please have some. Thanks. LABOR CAMP This is the blueprint of the Skydome. Skydome is nothing but a giant air conditioner for the city. These are the four vents which will be throwing hot air outside. But the problem is the hot air that will be coming out of these vents, will be equivalent to 500 jets taking off at one time. Right here, in front of Vent B is the famous giant garbage dump. Under 60 seconds, the emitted gases will catch fire and nobody will be able to stop that. No one. My guess is, in less than two hours, fire will engulf Unnati and destroy all that is outside. In my opinion, this is genocide. I didn't come from America to do this. Thank you. What's so important here? I have to find my daughter. Here? In the Commercial Sector? There is someone who knows where she is. What's her name? Your daughter. Leila. It's a nice name. I named her. Are you blind! - What are you doing? - Are you freaking blind! Go back to your Muslim ghetto! Go to hell! What a jerk! Blind as a bat, I tell you. NATIONAL SECURITY FORCE Shalini. Be quick. Mrs. Verma? Open your mouth. Tongue out. Are you married, or looking for a donor? Actually, Doctor, I'm looking for the other type of IVF. Doctor... May I come in? - Hi. - Hello. - Myself, Dr. Rakesh. - Mrs. Verma. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Please come. - Thanks. What is your husband's name? Actually, my friend told me about you. You did their IVF treatment. And they had a son. They're very happy. Can you please help us too? What's your friend's name? Well... Top secret? Don't worry. It's okay. My friend says, "Dr. Rakesh is a miracle worker." Please help us too. Please, Doctor. Of course I will, Mrs. Verma. It's my job to help you. You can get anything you want. Sons, daughters, long nose, small nose, curly hair, even dimples. They are mixed blood though. Is that okay? Yeah, I guess... A child is a child, after all, regardless of where it comes from. We have an entire inventory. Tell me what you're looking for. I... I want a daughter. Curly hair, big eyes, cute smile. It's hard to find such a perfect fit. But I will try. Just one second. Don't look around. Look straight ahead. Look straight ahead. Mrs. Verma, you can take your pick. The paperwork and chip can be sorted later. - Say it! - Uncle Joshi loves children. He says, "Today's children will make the Aryavarta of tomorrow." Say it again. Uncle Joshi loves children. He says, "Today's children... Did you like any of them? I want that girl. Oh! Sorry, Mrs. Verma. She's sold out. A business executive took her. Do you have any other girl of her age? Her age? Do you want a daughter or a worker? I want a girl specifically of that age. Don't worry about the money. I'll pay you as much as you want. Okay. Mrs. Verma, I can manage that for you. I've got the entire list of mixed-blood kids. What kind of list? Is it a list of the kids you have on hand? No. All the children born in Aryavarta. I'm the head of the Repeaters. And I can say that with pride. So you mean you have a list of all the mixed-blood children. Yes. - Oh, sorry! - Oh, hell! - I'm so sorry. So sorry. - Oh, God! Where did it go... Where is it? There you are. Oh, my baby. Oh, shit! It'll be all right. Who the hell are you? Bastard! You killed Leila! Let go of me! Leila! Let go of me! No! Get out! Get her out. - Take her. - Come on. Come on. Come on. Welcome back, Shalini. I told you, you'll never find your daughter. If you had believed me, you wouldn't be in this mess today. Subtitle translation by Priyadarshini Basu
