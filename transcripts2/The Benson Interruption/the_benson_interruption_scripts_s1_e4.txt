 - HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE BENSON INTERRUPTION WHERE TWO COMEDIANS ARE GIVEN MICROPHONES, BUT ONLY ONE IS A PRODUCER OF THE SHOW. A COMEDIAN WILL STAND RIGHT HERE AND SAY SOMETHING LIKE, "I FINALLY GOT THE JOKE. I REALIZE THAT FOCKER SOUNDS A LOT LIKE ****." IT DOES. AND THEN-- AND THEN I'LL BE SITTING IN THAT CHAIR, AND I'LL SAY SOMETHING LIKE,

 "I JUST REALIZED THAT YOU'RE A FOCKING IDIOT." ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU GUYS READY TO START THE INTERRUPTION? THIS ACTOR-COMEDIAN HAS BEEN A GUEST ON MY PODCAST DOUG LOVES MOVIES, AND YOU KNOW HIM FROM THE MOVIE 17 AGAIN AND FROM THE CLASSIC TV SKETCH SHOW THE STATE. PLEASE WELCOME MY FRIEND THOMAS LENNON. - THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DOUG BENSON. MY GOD. YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME, AND I CAN TELL THAT YOU'RE THINKING THIS, WHICH IS THAT, IF KATE GOSSELIN'S HAIR AND ADOLF HITLER'S HAIR HAD A BABY...

 - THAT WOULD BE REALLY WEIRD FOR HAIR TO BE HAVING BABIES. - I THOUGHT A LITTLE BIT THAT MY HAIR LOOKED LIKE KATE GOSSELIN AND HITLER, BUT THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO FINISH THAT JOKE PROVES THAT IT WAS 100% **** TRUE. - DO YOU KNOW ANY K.D. LANG SONGS? - UM... - IS YOUR HAIR THIS WAY FOR A ROLE? OR DO YOU HAVE IT THIS WAY JUST TO INSULT YOURSELF? - I DID WANT TO SAY VERY SINCERELY FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK ON COMEDY CENTRAL, UM, AFTER-- - YEAH. - THANK YOU. - IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK. WHAT DID YOU DO FOR COMEDY CENTRAL? - REFRESH OUR MEMORIES. - AFTER 88 EPISODES OF RENO 911... IN EXCHANGE, I GET TONIGHT, FOR DOING THIS SHOW, A iPOD DOCKING STATION WITH A POT LEAF STUCK TO IT. SO THAT'S WORTH PRETTY MUCH MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE. - I LIKE THAT. I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMEBODY DO THAT. LIKE, "THAT'S THE END OF THAT JOKE." - THAT'S--DOUG-- - I'M GONNA START SWINGING THE MICROPHONE AROUND. - THAT'S THE WAY THEY TEACH YOU TO DO STANDUP IN ESPANA WHERE THE MATADORS... IT SHOWS THE JOKE THAT IT'S NOT IN CHARGE OF YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MY AGE OR WHAT, BUT PRETTY RECENTLY I FOUND MYSELF IN A RITE AID, HOLDING A BOX OF JUST FOR MEN AND ASKING THE MANAGER, "HEY, DOES THIS WORK ON PUBES?" I HOPE THAT, IF I EVER HAVE TO GO TO PRISON, IT'S LEPRECHAUN PRISON. - I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS ALREADY. - OKAY, GO. - THERE ARE PRISONS FOR JUST LEPRECHAUNS? - IN MY MIND, I FEEL LIKE I'M-- I'M KING BITCH OF LEPRECHAUN PRISON, YOU KNOW? LIKE, WHO'S GONNA TAKE ME DOWN AT LEPRECHAUN PRISON? NOBODY. - YEAH, THEY'RE ALL LIKE-- THEY'RE NOT GONNA SHIV YOU BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO BUSY HIDING THEIR GOLD. - IT'S REAL-- FOR ME, IT WAS JUST 'CAUSE I'M SO-- I'M BIG COMPARED TO THEM. - YOU'RE TALLER THAN THEM. - YEAH. - NOW I GET IT. AND YOU'RE SENSITIVE TO LITTLE PEOPLE'S CONCERNS, SO THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SAY **** PRISON. - YOU CAN'T SAY **** ON COMEDY CENTRAL. WATCH. ****. - YOU SAY LEPRECHAUN PRISON. THEY'RE GONNA BLEEP OUT WHEN WE SAY ****? - WATCH. ****. GO HOME AND TIVO THIS. YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT THING THAT I JUST SAID. 'CAUSE IT DIDN'T **** EXIST. MY SON IS-- HE'S AN INFANT BASICALLY. HE'S ALMOST A TODDLER, BUT THEY SAY YOU CAN'T START EARLY ENOUGH WITH LANGUAGE, SO, UM, EVERY NIGHT BEFORE WE GO TO BED, I HOLD HIM, AND I GET WHERE HE CAN SEE MY MOUTH, AND I HOLD HIM CLOSE, AND I SAY, "AVENGE MY DEATH! "AVENGE MY DEATH! "UTHER, IT WAS WHAT POISONED YOUR FATHER. "WASH THIS LANCE IN BLOOD "TILL IT BEARS THE BITTEREST FRUIT. AVENGE ME, BOY." - NEXT TOPIC. - I HAVE A COUPLE OF, GOOGLE ALERTS ABOUT MYSELF. EVERYBODY HAS GOOGLE ALERTS ABOUT THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW, GOOGLE--THAT-- YOU CAN TYPE ANY SENTENCE, ANY COMBINATION OF WORDS, PUT IT INTO GOOGLE IN QUOTATION MARKS AND YOU'LL GET AN EMAIL ABOUT IT ANYTIME THOSE WORDS ARE--ARE--ARE WRITTEN OUT ANYWHERE IN THE INTERNET-- IN THE NEWS, OR IN A BLOG, OR ANYTHING. I WANTED TO HAVE ONE GOOGLE ALERT THAT I COULD MAKE HAPPEN ANYTIME I WANT, SO I HAVE "TOM LENNON "ARRESTED FOR BREAK DANCING OUTSIDE KOO KOO ROO WITH A RAGING BONER." SO I HAD-- THAT ONE'S ALREADY SET. ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT I DO THAT... ON THE WAY HOME TONIGHT. - LIKE, IN RE-- LIKE, IN REPORTING ON THE INCIDENT, SOMEONE WOULD USE THE WORD "RAGING"... LIKE, THAT'S NO REGULAR BONER. THAT GUY'S BONER WAS RAGING. - WELL, YEAH. YEAH. YEAH, DOUG. - THAT WAS A RAGIN' CAJUN BONER. - YEAH, UM, IT PROBABLY WAS 'CAUSE IT MADE THE NEWS. - HA HA HA HA! STUPID. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE TOM LENNON AFTER THESE COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS. - WELCOME BACK TO THE BENSON INTERRUPTION, WHERE I CAN'T STOP INTERRUPTING THOMAS LENNON. I CAN'T STOP, BUDDY. HEY, LET'S HAVE A TWEET-OFF. - ALL RIGHT. - LET'S DO IT. - THAT'S LIKE THE LEAST OFFENSIVE QUEEF IMAGINABLE. - YEAH, IT'S VERY UPBEAT. - OTHER THAN, LIKE, SMURFETTE. - I SMELL-- I SMELL BLUEBERRIES. DID, SMURFETTE QUEEF? - DOUG, GO. - VERY GOOD. VERY GOOD. - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TOM LENNON! THANK YOU, TOM. YOU MAY RECOGNIZE THIS HILARIOUS GENTLEMAN FROM THE COMEDY CENTRAL SHOW MICHAEL AND MICHAEL HAVE ISSUES. OOH, WHICH-- WHICH MICHAEL IS HE? AND YOU CAN SEE HIM IN THE FILM KIDS IN AMERICA. PLEASE WELCOME MY FRIEND MICHAEL IAN BLACK! - HI, EVERYBODY. SO I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO TODAY. AS I WAS GOING OUTSIDE, I SAW A GUY RIDING BY ON A UNICYCLE, AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, "THIS IS GOING TO BE A TERRIBLE DAY." - WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? SORRY TO INTERRUPT. - I FORGIVE YOU. - IT LOOKS LIKE THIS. RIGHT? - YEAH, THEY ALWAYS ACT LIKE, "NO BIG DEAL. THIS THING THAT I..." - NO. - "TOOK ME YEARS TO LEARN." - "THIS IS JUST-- "I'M JUST RIDING A UNICYCLE. "THIS IS JUST MY PREFERRED MODE OF TRANSPORTATION." "WHAT'S UP?" AND SO I LOOKED AT HIM THE WAY I ALWAYS LOOK AT PEOPLE ON UNICYCLES, AND IT'S A LOOK THAT I CAN-- IT CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED AS "WITH DISGUST." RIGHT? AND THIS LITTLE INVOLUNTARY NOISE CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH. AND THE NOISE WAS THIS. UGHHH. AND HE HEARD ME. I COULD TELL HE HEARD ME 'CAUSE HE GAVE ME A LOOK. AND THE LOOK WAS LIKE... EXCEPT HE WAS RIDING THE UNICYCLE, SO IT WAS LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT'S WORSE THAN THE GUY ON THE UNICYCLE? HAVE YOU SEEN THE GUY ON THE RECUMBENT BICYCLE? I HATE THAT GUY. - DO NOT GET ME STARTED ABOUT RECUMBENCY. HAVE YOU SEEN THAT GUY? THE GUY WHO RIDES THE RECUMBENT BICYCLE, LIKE THIS. THAT SMUG ****HOLE. - I'VE GOT A BABY ON THE BACK. - I'M JUST RIDING MY RECUMBENT BICYCLE. I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYBODY'S NOT-- BICYCLE'S LIKE THIS. SO MUCH MORE ERGONOMIC. I'M SAVING SO MUCH ENERGY RIGHT NOW. I'M SAVING SO MUCH ENERGY. WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS I'M GONNA SELL THE ENERGY I'M NOT USING BACK TO THE POWER COMPANY. I'M MAKING MONEY RIGHT NOW RIDING MY RECUMBENT BICYCLE. I'M GROWING SOYBEANS ON THE BACK. I'M--MY LEGS ARE-- - WAIT UP, WAIT UP, WAIT UP, WAIT UP. - I'M GONNA PASS OUT. MY LEGS ARE-- I CANNOT DO ANY MORE RECUMBENT BICYCLE MATERIAL BECAUSE I AM NOT IN THE KIND OF SHAPE THAT RECUMBENT BICYCLE JOKES REQUIRE, YOU GUYS. - WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. I WAS HOPING YOU'D DO THE GUY FROM THE '20s WITH THE GIANT WHEEL... BICYCLE. THAT GUY. DO HIM. - ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO GET ON LIKE THIS. - YEAH, YOU GOTTA GET ON. - WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE MICHAEL IAN BLACK AFTER THESE COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS. - WELCOME BACK TO THE BENSON INTERRUPTION, WHERE I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF INTERRUPTING MICHAEL IAN BLACK. HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HAVE A TWEET-OFF? - YEAH, MOTHER****. - LET'S READ SOME TWEETS. - I WROTE THIS ONE. THE FILM WAS ANNOUNCED THAT JUSTIN BIEBER'S GONNA BE DOING IN 3-D. - YEAH. - DO YOU WANNA PUT ON YOUR SPECTACLES? - A LITTLE MORE ESOTERIC, BUT IN MY MIND, CHEWBACCA'S WALKING AROUND LIKE THIS... YOU KNOW, GOING-- - IT'D BE VERY FUNNY. - YOU SHOULD LEARN HOW TO DO A CHEWBACCA NOISE. - I DON'T DO IMPRESSIONS, DOUG, I'M NOT A HACK. I DO PANTOMIME. - CHEWBACCA, NO. RECUMBENT BICYCLE, YES. - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MICHAEL IAN BLACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS PERFORMER PLAYS PRINCIPAL CUTLER ON HBO'S EASTBOUND & DOWN. AND HE PLAYS THE VILLAIN IN THE YOGI BEAR MOVIE, WHICH I BELIEVE TECHNICALLY IS CALLED YOGI BEAR: 3-D. PLEASE WELCOME MY FRIEND ANDY DALY. - GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, AUDIENCE. GOOD EVENING, DOUG. HELLO, AMERICA. FOLKS, THIS IS GONNA COME AS A SURPRISE TO YOU, BUT WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN, I WAS A BIT OF A NERD. ANYWAY, WHAT I DID WAS I WROTE A, A HUMOR COLUMN, OF COURSE, FULL OF, HILARIOUS OBSERVATIONS ABOUT LIFE AT BEN FRANKLIN JUNIOR HIGH. AND-- AND I LEARNED A VERY IMPORTANT LESSON ABOUT COMEDY FROM THAT HUMOR COLUMN THAT I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU, IF I MAY. DURING FOOTBALL SEASON, THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD WOULD HANG THESE UGLY OAK TAG SIGNS ALL OVER THE CAFETERIA THAT SAID STUFF LIKE, "CRUSH PARAMUS CATHOLIC, SLAUGHTER THE BLESSED SACRAMENT." FUN STUFF LIKE THAT. "MURDER A NUN." AND THEY WOULD ALWAYS HANG ONE OF THESE SIGNS OVER THE CLOCK IN THE CAFETERIA SO YOU COULDN'T SEE WHAT TIME IT WAS. WELL, THAT IS HOW THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD WANDERED INTO THE SCOPES OF MY HUMOR GUN. BECAUSE, HERE'S WHAT I WROTE IN THE, IN THE SCHOOL NEWSPAPER ABOUT THAT. I SAID, "HEY, HOW COME THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD "ALWAYS HANGS ONE OF THEIR UGLY SIGNS "OVER THE CAFETERIA CLOCK? "WE CAN'T SEE WHAT TIME IT IS, "AND THE SIGNS DON'T EVEN WORK. OUR FOOTBALL TEAM STILL SUCKS." - I'M GUESSING-- - YEAH. - IF I MAY JUMP AHEAD IN YOUR STORY. - THAT'S FINE. JUMP ALL THE WAY AT THE END. - THAT LED TO A **** TON OF CHEERLEADER ****. BUT THE FALLOUT FROM MY HILARIOUS TAKEDOWN OF ALL OF THE STRONGEST AND MOST POPULAR KIDS IN SCHOOL WAS PRETTY BAD. IT WAS BASICALLY THIS. PICTURE A SCRAWNY, 13-YEAR-OLD ME... WITH MY ARMS HELD BEHIND MY BACK BY THE CAPTAIN OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM WHILE, EVERYONE ON THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD TOOK TURNS PUNCHING ME IN THE STOMACH. - SO IT'S JUST GIRL PUNCHES. - YEAH, W-- GIRL PUNCHES. MAYBE THEY DON'T HURT AS MUCH PHYSICALLY, BUT MENTALLY... - HOLD THAT THOUGHT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE ANDY DALY AFTER THESE COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS. - WELCOME BACK TO THE BENSON INTERRUPTION, WHERE I'M INTERRUPTING ANDY DALY. HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HAVE A TWEET-OFF? - YEAH! - LET'S DO IT. - DOES THE TWEET-OFF HAVE A THEME SONG? - NO, PEOPLE JUST CLAP, AND THEN WE DO IT. - AUNT BERU. - I DON'T KNOW THAT SHOW, BUT I DO KNOW GETTING PUNCHED IN THE BALLS. SO JUST OUT OF FAMILIARITY, I WOULD CHOOSE THAT. - GO WITH WHAT YOU KNOW. - YEAH, GO WITH WHAT YOU KNOW. - WHY TAKE AN UNNECESSARY RISK? THE OTHER ONE MIGHT BE WORSE THAN GETTING PUNCHED IN THE BALLS. - WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW THAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT SHOW. - I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAT DOWN ON TWITTER AND SPELLED OUT AHMADINEJAD. - I DID. - I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO START. I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. - THERE'S OTHER DESTINATIONS ON THE INTERNET THAT CAN TELL YOU THINGS LIKE THAT. - YEAH, BUT YOU GOTTA FIND THAT, AND THEN TYPE IT IN THE OTHER PLACE. - I GOT THE TIME. - YOU'RE TALENTED. - YOU SLEEP IN A BIG GIRL BED? - NO, WHY? WHY? - ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO ONE MORE. YOU GOT ONE MORE? - OKAY. - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ANDY DALY! - THANK YOU VERY MUCH. - THANK YOU, ANDY. CALL YOUR MOTHER. GOOD NIGHT! - THAT'S NOT WATER.
