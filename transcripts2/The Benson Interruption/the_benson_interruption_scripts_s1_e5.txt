 ONE OF MY COMEDIAN FRIENDS IS GONNA COME OUT AND STAND RIGHT HERE AND TELL A JOKE, LIKE, "I FINALLY SAW WALL MONEY NEVER SLEEPS "WHICH MEANS MONEY NEVER SAW MONEY NEVER SLEEPS." AND THEN I'M GONNA SIT IN THAT CHAIR RIGHT THERE AND INTERRUPT THEM WITH SOMETHING LIKE, "MONEY CAN'T SLEEP OR WATCH MOVIES. YOUR HUMOR IS ABSURD." ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU GUYS READY TO START THE INTERRUPTION? YEAH. THIS COMEDIAN'S LATEST CD IS CALLED FART AND WEINER JOKES. AND YOU CAN SEE HIM IN THE UPCOMING FILM,

 LLOYD THE CONQUEROR. I THINK THAT'S MADE UP. PLEASE WELCOME MY FRIEND, BRIAN POSEHN! - ALL RIGHT, SO I JUST HAD A BABY. UM... - WHOO! - YAY. YEAH. - THAT'S AWESOME. NOBODY ELSE DOES THAT. - WE JUST DID IT FROM. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. - YOU'RE SO SPECIAL. - YEAH. - THAT'S HOW YOU DID IT? - YEAH, JUST FROM PENIS AND VAGINA. - THAT'S ALL IT TAKES? A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TO GO SEE A DOCTOR. - NUH. - YOU GOT THE JOB DONE. - MY WIFE HAS A GOOD VAGINA, APPARENTLY. I DON'T KNOW. MY PENIS, I DON'T KNOW SO MUCH. - SO ANYWAY... IT'S ALREADY FUN! - THEY WORKED WELL TOGETHER. - BEING INTERRUPTED. - YOUR PENIS AND HER VAGINA. YOU HAVE A BABY. - GOD DAMN IT, REALLY? - YEAH. IT'S THE BENSON INTERRUPTION. - YEAH, I KNOW. - NOT THE BENSON LETS BRIAN TALK. - YOU SON OF A BITCH. WHY'D I SAY YES TO THIS? ANYWAY. - SO IF YOU KNOW ME, AS YOU DO, I USED TO-- - I WON'T INTERRUPT ANYMORE. I PROMISE. - GOD! - THAT WAS THE LAST ONE FOR THE NIGHT. I'M JUST GONNA SIT HERE AND HOLD A MICROPHONE TO MY FACE. - IT'S GONNA BE GOOD. SO NOW, BUT IT'S HARD, BECAUSE I USED TO BE ONE OF THOSE COMEDIANS THAT HATED OTHER COMEDIANS THAT TALKED ABOUT THEIR BABY, RIGHT? - IT'S THE WORST. AS SOON AS A COMEDIAN HAS A BABY THEY'RE NO LONGER FUNNY. - YEAH. NO, HE'S RIGHT. THEY'LL BE LIKE, EDGY, AND SUPER FUNNY, AND LIKE, HAVE HILARIOUS ABORTION MATERIAL. AND THEN... - WHAT--THEY-- - WAIT, WHO HAS HILARIOUS ABORTION MATERIAL? - A LOT OF GUYS. ANYWAY... - AND LADIES. LET'S BE FAIR. - BUT YEAH, I USED TO HATE, LIKE, WHEN GUYS WOULD CHANGE AND THEY'D BE LIKE, "AND NOW I LOOKED INTO MY BABY EYES AND IT WAS SO PRECIOUS, AND BEH, BEH, BEH," RIGHT? AND I USED TO SAY, LIKE, IF I EVER DO THAT, IF YOU EVER SEE ME HAVE A BABY AND THEN I'M UP ON STAGE, LIKE, "AND MY BABY CHANGED MY LIFE AND DEH, DEH, DEH, DEH, DEH," I USED TO SAY THAT IF I DO THAT I WANT YOU TO PUNCH MY BABY. - IS YOUR BABY HERE NOW? - NO. - IT'S A GOOD THING 'CAUSE YOU JUST TOLD ME TO PUNCH YOUR BABY. - NO, I KNOW! AND THAT JOKE WAS WRITTEN PRE-BABY. - AND NOW YOU HAVE A BABY, YOU DON'T WANNA GET HIM PUNCHED. - NO, I WOULD LIKE FOR HIM TO REMAIN UNPUNCHED FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. AND I KNOW HAVING THESE GENES, THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT FOR HIM. - WHAT DO YOU THINK? LIKE, WHEN HE'S TEN? CAN I PUNCH HIM WHEN HE'S TEN? - SURE. BUT NO, I'M-- DID I SAY THAT? YEAH. I'M JUST AFRAID-- - IT'S OFFICIAL, IT'S ON TELEVISION. - YEAH. I'M JUST AFRAID HE'S GONNA BE, LIKE, 15, AND HE'S GONNA BE AT SCHOOL, HE'S GONNA BE THE GOOFY-LOOKING KID, AND HE'S GONNA BE READING STEPHEN KING UNDER A TREE AT LUNCH. AND SOME JOCK'S GONNA WALK UP AND GO, "WHY YOU READING AT SCHOOL, ?" PUNCH. IT HAPPENED TO POPS, SO... THE BIGGEST THING, THOUGH, FOR HAVING A KID THAT I'M GOING THROUGH-- LIKE, THE WEIRDEST THING IS, LIKE, WHEN DO I SHARE MY NERDY OBSESSIONS WITH MY KID? LIKE, WHEN DO I PLAY METAL FOR HIM? LIKE, WHEN DO I PLAY SLAYER FOR HIM, YOU KNOW? AND, LIKE, WHEN DO I TURN HIM ON TO HORROR MOVIES? LIKE, IS ONE TOO YOUNG TO SEE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD? OR, YOU KNOW... OR DO YOU WAIT TILL HE'S, LIKE, TWO AND THREE AND GETS BLACK AND WHITE. AND THE BIG THING IS... LIKE, THE ONE THING THAT I'M REALLY-- THAT'S REALLY SCREWING ME UP IS WHEN DO I PLAY WEIRD AL FOR MY KID? LIKE... YES. I LOVE WEIRD AL. BUT HERE'S THE THING, AND DO YOU FIRST-- - DO YOU PLAY HIM THE ORIGINALS? RIGHT, DO YOU PLAY HIM, LIKE, QUEEN AND GO, "BUDDY, THIS IS A GREAT BAND. "BRIAN MAY, FREDDIE MERCURY. "THEY DID ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST. "NOW THIS IS WEIRD AL'S HILARIOUS VERSION, ANOTHER ONE RIDES THE BUS." - BECAUSE QUEEN FORGOT TO USE AN ACCORDION IN THEIR RECORDING. - RIGHT. OR DO YOU DO WHAT I'M GONNA DO, AND PRESENT ALL WEIRD AL MUSIC LIKE IT'S ALL COMPLETELY ORIGINAL? YEAH. SO THE FIRST TIME HE'S AT A PARTY AND HE HEARS, LIKE, MICHAEL JACKSON, AND HE'S LIKE, "WHAT THE IS THIS?" - WHO COVERED AL YANKOVIC AND THEN MADE THE WORDS NOT FUNNY? - THIS SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE EAT IT. - BUT IT'S NOT AS FUNNY AS EAT IT. THIS GUY RUINED A FUNNY SONG. - THIS MICHAEL JACKSON OWES WEIRD AL SOME MONEY. - WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE BRIAN POSEHN AFTER THESE COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS. - HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S HAVE A TWEET-OFF. - OKAY. - LET'S DO IT. YOU WANNA GO FIRST? - SURE. - ALL RIGHT, READ A TWEET. - "I WAS STOPPED BY A DRUG DOG AT AN AIRPORT LAST NIGHT. "I WASN'T HOLDING. APPARENTLY, THEY CAN SMELL MY BLOODSTREAM." - "MY LEFT EYE IS 0/0, BUT MY RIGHT ONE IS 20/20. HASH TAG, TWEETS FROM A PIRATE." - WHAT AN IDIOT. SIX BACHELORETTE PARTIES AT MY EARLY SHOW. GOOD IDEA, LADIES. GO WATCH THREE UGLY GUYS TALK ABOUT THEIR FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF. LIKE, SERIOUSLY, IF YOU'RE IN A BACHELORETTE PARTY, GO WATCH A DUDE TAKE HIS CLOTHES OFF, DON'T GO TO A COMEDY SHOW, RIGHT, BUDDY? - YEAH, YEAH. THEY RUIN COMEDY SHOWS 'CAUSE THEY SCREAM, "TALK ABOUT US!" AND, LIKE, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SAY ABOUT YOU? ONE OF YOU IS GETTING MARRIED, AND... SO WHAT? - BALLOONS SHAPED LIKE DILDOS ON THEIR HEAD AND STUFF. - YEAH, JUST EAT YOUR CAKE AND SHUT UP. - EXACTLY. ALL RIGHT, WHAT ELSE? - "BE SURE TO EAT A BIG MEAL BEFORE SEEING JACKASS 3D, SO THAT YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY TO THROW UP." - MY GOD, THAT'S DISGUSTING. BUT... BUT FUNNY. - YEAH, A LOT OF BALLS AND... - I--BALLS DON'T MAKE ME THROW UP. A GUY SITTING IN A-- - WELL, LET'S TRY SOMETHING LATER. I HAVE AN IDEA. - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BRIAN POSEHN. THANKS, BUDDY! THIS PERFORMER HAS BEEN A GUEST ON MY PODCAST DOUG LOVES MOVIES, AND HE HAS HIS OWN PODCAST COMING SOON, CALLED THE SMARTEST MAN IN THE WORLD. PLEASE WELCOME THE SMARTEST MAN IN THE WORLD, MY FRIEND, GREG PROOPS! - HI. HELLO, DOUG. HELLO, PEOPLE. YEAH. YOU KNOW, ALL THE CABLE CHANNELS ARE SO CONFUSING. THEY'RE ALL NAMED ONE THING BUT THEY NEVER SHOW THE THING THEY'RE NAMED. LIKE, UM... A&E.; A&E;, IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS, STANDS FOR "ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT." HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING ARTY OR ENTERTAINING ON A&E;? YEAH, DOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER IS ON A&E.; YEAH, HARDLY AN OPERA HELD IN VENICE OR WHATEVER. IT'S A METH-HEADED MULLET WHO BUSTS HAWAIIAN GUYS FOR SMOKING PAKALOLO. YOU KNOW, THE DIGGETY DANK THAT YOU SMOKE UNTIL YOUR EYES GO SIDEWAYS, AND YOUR HEAD SNAPS OFF, AND LAVA SHOOTS OUT YOUR ASS, AND YOU HAVE SNOOP ON REDIAL. YOU KNOW. - YOU'RE GONNA BE HARD TO INTERRUPT. A LOT OF WORDS STREAM OUT OF YOU. THE E CHANNEL. E. STANDS FOR "ENTERTAINMENT." RIGHT? AND AGAIN, MAYBE WE'RE STRETCHING THE DEFINITION OF ENTERTAINMENT A LITTLE BIT. THE KARDASHIANS ARE ON THE E CHANNEL. NOW I'M--DON'T GET ME WRONG, I'M ALL FOR THE KARDASHIANS. I LOVE THEM. I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT ANYTIME AN ARMENIAN HOOKER VESSEL RUNS AGROUND IN THE UNITED STATES, ON OUR SHORES, IT BEHOOVES US AS A NATION TO PROVIDE THEM WITH GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT BY GIVING THEM A REALITY SHOW. I--YEAH. CALL ME A PATRIOT. THANK YOU. - IT HAS BEEN DECREED. YOU DON'T GET TO SIT IN A CHAIR LIKE THIS UNLESS YOU GET TO MAKE SOME IMPORTANT DECISIONS. - NO KIDDING. DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE A CROWN, AND A SCEPTER, AND WHATNOT? WELL, YOUR MIC'S YOUR SCEPTER. - I DON'T WANNA BE OSTENTATIOUS ABOUT IT. - CERTAINLY NOT. - NO. - HAVING ME ON A TURKISH RUG WHILE YOU SIT IN A COMFY CHAIR IS THE VERY HEIGHT OF HUMILITY AND MODESTY. - WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE HISTORY CHANNEL? I WAS ON THERE ONCE IN A SHOW ABOUT THE HISTORY OF COMEDY. - REALLY? - YEAH. WAIT, WAIT, WHICH PART SURPRISED YOU? - NO, I'M--I'M-- - 'CAUSE I AM A PART OF THE HISTORY OF COMEDY. I'M PART OF BRINGING IT DOWN. - LET ME UNDERSTAND THIS, DOUG. - YES. - THE HISTORY CHANNEL WAS DOING A HISTORY OF-- THEY TOOK TIME OUT FROM SHOWING, LIKE, HITLER, AND THE LUFTWAFFE, AND WHATNOT TO DO THE HISTORY OF COMEDY AND THEY HAD YOU ON? WERE YOU, LIKE, A PROFESSOR TALKING HEAD TYPE? - YEAH, I SAID SOME-- YOU KNOW, SOME VERY INSIGHTFUL THINGS ABOUT GALLAGHER. DOES THE HISTORY CHANNEL SHOW ANYTHING ABOUT HISTORY? - YEAH, ONCE IN A WHILE. BUT MY POINT IS THIS, GUYS LIKE THE HISTORY CHANNEL. WOMEN DON'T LIKE IT THAT MUCH. THIS IS MY IMPRESSION OF EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD WALKING INTO THE ROOM WHILE THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER IS WATCHING THE HISTORY CHANNEL. "HEY, I THOUGHT WE'D-- OH. ." - SO IF YOU DON'T WANNA GO SHOPPING, OR GARDEN, OR MANY OTHER THINGS SHE MIGHT ASK YOU TO DO, YOU JUST LEAVE THE HISTORY CHANNEL ON. - DUDE, YOU'LL BE ALONE ALL DAY. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO VACUUM. YOU JUST HAVE TO WATCH LIFETIME LATER AND PRETEND TO BE SYMPATHETIC WHEN SOMEONE DIES OF CANCER. - PRETEND? THAT'S--I'M ALL ABOUT PEOPLE DYING--BEING SYMPA-- FORGET IT. - YOU REALLY ARE. THAT'S WHY I-- - I DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND. IT'S ACTUALLY SAD. - IT IS SAD. - YEAH. - NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND, IT REALLY IS SAD. - WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE GREG PROOPS, AFTER THESE COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS. YEAH. - WELCOME BACK TO THE BENSON INTERRUPTION, WHERE I WAS JUST INTERRUPTING MR. GREG PROOPS. WHY DON'T WE HAVE A TWEET-OFF? - YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE FANCY...? I GOT, LIKE, A STEAM-POWERED BLACKBERRY FROM 1945. YOU GOTTA POUR WATER IN THE TOP AND WHATNOT. - MY PHONE IS ACTUALLY FROM THE FLINTSTONES. THERE'S A COUPLE OF ANIMALS INSIDE IT. AND WHENEVER I MAKE A CALL, THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND GO, "IT'S A LIVING." I WISH HE'D QUIT TEXTING. CHISELING IN THE MARBLE. - THIS ONE WAS DURING THE OLYMPICS. THE WINTER OLYMPICS. "CANADA, OKAY, YOU WON IN HOCKEY. "NOW PLAY US IN SOMETHING WE'RE GOOD AT, LIKE SENSELESS VIOLENCE, AND LET'S SEE WHO PREVAILS." - WOW, YOU REALLY THROW IT DOWN. - DUDE. - IN YOUR TWEETS. YOU'RE NOT MESSING AROUND. - BUDDY. WHEN IT COMES TO CANADIA, I'M MERCILESS. - I LOVE CANADIA. - ME TOO. ESPECIALLY BRITISH COLUMBIA, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY GROW THE DIGGETY DOOKS. - THAT GUY KNOWS. - WITH THAT HAIRDO AND THAT T-SHIRT, HELL, YES, HE KNOWS. HE'S GONNA GET US ALL ARRESTED. - "I JUST THOUGHT OF A WORD FOR HUMAN BEINGS--" LIKE, YOU KNOW HOW WHEN YOU'RE, LIKE, IN VEGAS OR DISNEYLAND, PEOPLE ARE, YOU KNOW, BARELY MOVING IN FRONT OF YOU? "I JUST THOUGHT OF A WORD FOR HUMAN BEINGS SLOW-MO SAPIENS." - YOURS ARE ALL PUN-TASTIC. I LOVE THAT. I TRY NOT TO PUN-TIFICATE. WHY DO PEOPLE WALK SO SLOW AND FORM A HUGE HUMAN BEEF BLOCKADE IN FRONT OF YOU ALL THE TIME? WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING AT? - 'CAUSE STUFF'S GOING ON. LIKE, PEOPLE ARE JUST CONSTANTLY DELIGHTED BY THE IDEA OF LIGHTS, AND SOUNDS, AND SPARKLY THINGS. - LIKE THE WORLD IS THIS SWIRLING MIASMA OF FRACTALS LIKE THE MATRIX OR SOMETHING. ALL THEY SEE ARE GREEN NUMERALS RUNNING UP AND DOWN. UNFATHOMABLE, YOU KNOW, LIKE-- - YEAH. EAT THE BLUE PILL. - YEAH, EXACTLY. ALL I CAN OFFER YOU IS THE TRUTH. - THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GREG PROOPS! - THANKS. - YOU MAY RECOGNIZE THIS NEXT COMEDIAN FROM HER APPEARANCE ON PREMIUM BLEND 11 YEARS AGO. AND YOU CAN FIND OUT IF SHE'S COMING TO YOUR TOWN BY GOING TO THE WEBSITE THAT BEARS HER NAME-- WAIT FOR IT. PLEASE WELCOME MY FRIEND TIG NOTARO. - HI, DOUG. HELLO. - BEING A FEMALE COMEDIAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE GIVE US A HARD TIME, SAYING-- - IT'S THE WORST BEING A FEMALE COMEDIAN. I'M SICK OF IT. THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING. BEING A FEMALE COMEDIAN. THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ONE. - DEPENDS ON THE ANGLE. - WHAT? - WHOO! - WHOO! - WELL, I'M CURIOUS, WHAT ANGLE MAKES ME LOOK LIKE A FEMALE? - THIS ONE RIGHT NOW. YOU TOTALLY LOOK LADYLIKE. - WOW. - YEAH. - GET HER LADY SIDE. LET'S MAKE SURE WE-- HELLO. IN A SIMPLE SPIN, SHE GOES BOY, LADY, SUPERMODEL. - IT WAS NOT A SIMPLE SPIN. PEOPLE ALWAYS GIVE FEMALE COMEDIANS A HARD TIME, SAYING ALL WE EVER DO IS MAKE JOKES ABOUT THINGS LIKE GOING TO THE GYNECOLOGIST. - TOTALLY TRUE. - BUT I DON'T. I MEAN, I DON'T GO. - THAT'S A WAY TO PUT A STOP TO THAT PROBLEM. YOU'LL NEVER TELL JOKES ABOUT IT IF YOU NEVER GO. - NO, I DO GO. - I GO ALL THE TIME. - LIKE TODAY? - YEAH. - AND THEN I'M TRYING TO GET MY DOCTOR TO SEE ME AGAIN TOMORROW. I WANT CONSTANT UPDATES. WHAT'S MORE DISGUSTING? NEVER GOING OR GOING ALL THE TIME? THE ANSWER IS BOTH. - I HAD MY ANSWER. BUT THAT'S A GOOD ONE TOO. - WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER? - THE FIRST ONE. - THE FIRST ONE IS GROSSER? NEVER GOING? - NEVER GOING IS PRETTY GROSS. GOING ALL THE TIME, THAT'S GONNA BE... THAT'S GONNA BE CLEAN AS A WHISTLE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH TIG NOTARO AFTER THESE COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS! - WELCOME BACK TO THE BENSON INTERRUPTION, WITH TIG NOTARO. - NOW, DOUG, I HAVE TO SAY I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN TWEETING. - YEAH, WE HAVE TWEET-OFFS WITH THE PEOPLE THAT COME OUT HERE. - CAN YOU STOP INTERRUPTING ME? - WHEN, NOW? - NO, IN A MINUTE. - I LOOK FORWARD TO IT. - NO, YEAH, I DON'T-- I'M NOT--I DON'T HAVE A-- - HAS IT BEEN A MINUTE YET? - 20 MORE SEC-- - YOU DON'T TWEET. YOU DON'T TWEET. YOU'RE ONE OF THE COMEDIANS THAT DOESN'T TWEET. - I DON'T TWEET. - SO WE'RE LIKE, "LET'S HAVE A TWEET-OFF," AND YOU'RE LIKE, "I CAN'T DO THAT." - BUT I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD... I--WHAT I DO DO IS, UM... I DO TEXT PEOPLE. - SO YOU WANNA, LIKE, HAVE A TEXT OFF? YOU WANNA READ SOME TEXTS THAT YOU WOULD-- - YEAH, I'D RATHER-- LIKE, I'D LIKE YOU TO TWEET. YOU KNOW, READ ME YOUR TWEETS, AND I WOULD LIKE TO READ YOU MY TEXTS. - OKAY. - MY TEXTS THAT HAVE BEEN-- THAT HAVE PROVEN TO BE WILDLY POPULAR. OVER THE YEARS. - ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS. - ALL RIGHT, THIS WAS ONE WHEN I WAS LEAVING MY HOUSE. "ON MY WAY." - THEY LOVE YOUR TEXTS. - THEY'RE REALLY GOOD. I'LL GIVE MY NUMBER OUT TO ANYBODY. - "THE RE-RELEASE OF AVATAR "WILL FEATURE NINE MINUTES OF NEW FOOTAGE. YAY! NINE MORE MINUTES OF NAP TIME." DO YOU HAVE, LIKE, ONE OF YOUR HEAVIER TEXTS THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN? LIKE, THAT'S REALLY KIND OF PHILOSOPHICAL AND DEEP? - EASY. - ALL RIGHT. LET'S HEAR IT. LIKE, SET UP THE SITUATION IN WHICH YOU TEXTED IT, AND THEN WHAT YOU WROTE. - WELL, THIS WAS IN RESPONSE... GOD--I CAN'T--I DON'T EVEN FEEL COMFORTABLE SAYING WHAT... - SOMEBODY WROTE SOMETHING TO YOU... - THAT WAS PRETTY INTENSE. - AND THEN YOU RESPONDED. - "'KAY." - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TIG NOTARO! REMEMBER TO FLOSS AFTER EVERY MEAL. GOOD NIGHT! - MAKEUP.
