 T.J. MILLER. - YEAH! I, UM... I READ RECENTLY IN THE NEWS-- AND BY THAT, I MEAN MY COUSIN WAS ON YAHOO!'S HOME PAGE AND TOLD ME ABOUT THIS-- THAT A COUPLE, A YOUNG COUPLE TRIED TO SELL THEIR BABY, IN THE PARKING LOT OF A WAL-MART. IT'S TRUE. SO THEY ARE CLEARLY METH HEADS, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I SAW THEIR, PHOTOS ONLINE. AND DO YOU EVER--YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE ON METH AND YOU'RE LIKE, "I WANT TO SCRATCH MY FACE." AND SO YOU SCRATCH YOUR FACE A LITTLE BIT AND THEN YOU'RE LIKE, "I WANT TO SCRATCH IT MORE." SO YOU SCRATCH IT A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND THEN YOU'RE LIKE, "I CAN'T SCRATCH MY FACE ANY MORE. IT'S GONNA START BLEEDING." BUT THEN YOU SCRATCH IT ANYWAY. THAT'S WHAT THESE GUYS LOOK LIKE. - THEY HAD REALLY SCRATCHED-UP FACES? - SUPER-SCRATCHED-UP FACES. - MAYBE THEY... HAVE A LOT OF CATS. THAT'S RIGHT, CAT'S THAT-- - AND WHY WOULD YOU JUDGE THEM AS METH HEADS JUST BECAUSE THEIR FACES ARE ALL SCRATCHED UP? - I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN SOMEBODY WHO HAD A REALLY SCRATCHED-UP FACE AND LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE ABOUT TO DIE AND BEEN LIKE, "I BET THAT PERSON HAS MORE THAN THREE CATS," YOU KNOW? BUT-- - WE GOT A MULTIPLE-CAT SITUATION ON OUR HANDS. - SO THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, 'CAUSE I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE SALE OF BABIES, REALLY, OR ABOUT-- - HOW MUCH DID THEY WANT FOR THE BABY? - THAT'S THE THING. THEY WERE CHARGING, FOR THE BABY, $50. SO... NO, I THINK YOU'RE ING-- - THAT SEEMS LIKE AN OVERPRICED BABY TO ME. YOU COULD TOTALLY GET A BABY FOR FREE IF YOU KNOW THE RIGHT LADY. - SO HOW MUCH DO THINK A BABY REALLY IS WORTH, TRULY? LIKE, $1,500? - LIKE, IF THEY HAD AN ACTUAL AMOUNT ON PRICE IS RIGHT? - YEAH. - LIKE, IF A BABY WAS PART OF THE SHOWCASE SHOWDOWN? - YEAH. - LIKE, SOMEBODY DID GREAT AT PLINKO, AND NOW THEY GET TO MAYBE BID ON A BABY? - YEAH. AND THEN-- AND SOMEBODY ELSE HAD ALREADY SAID ZERO, SO NOW YOU'RE LIKE, "NO. I GOT TO GET RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE," YOU KNOW? I THINK A BABY'S WORTH, WHAT, $1,500? AT LEAST. - WELL, WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? LIKE, CAN YOU PUT THEM TO WORK RIGHT AWAY OR SOMETHING OR...? - YEAH, BUT YOU HAVE A LITTLE BABY-- - IT'S A DUMB LITTLE BABY. YOU GOT TO TAKE CARE OF IT. RIGHT? - ALL RIGHT, $1,200. - IS THAT THE END OF THE BABY BIT? - WELL, IT WASN'T REALLY A BIT. IT WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT ABOUT AND WAS HOPING YOU'D BE ABLE TO INTERRUPT ME PERIODICALLY AND MAKE IT HILARIOUS. I DID WHAT I COULD. SO I WENT TO KANSAS CITY, AND, I WAS PLAYING A CLUB THERE, AND I DO THESE SHORT CHARACTERS. HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE? - LITTLE, LIKE, ALMOST LIKE IMPRESSIONS? - YEAH, KIND OF. THEY'RE, LIKE-- - LIKE, THIS IS A DUDE WHO DOES THIS? - YEAH, BUT I WAS DOING ONE-- IT'S A GIRL-- WHENEVER SHE LETS DOWN HER HAIR, SHE SHAKES OUT HER HAIR. BUT SHE DOES IT FOR A LITTLE TOO LONG, YOU KNOW? SO IT'S LIKE, "IT'S GETTING HOT IN HERE." BUT I-- I WASN'T ABLE TO FINISH IT, BECAUSE SOMEBODY IN THE BACK, OF THE CLUB YELLED, "THAT'S HOW I EAT ****!" - BUT AREN'T YOU AFRAID THAT IF WE DO THIS BIT ON THE SHOW AND THEY DROP OUT THE WORD ****, IT'S JUST GONNA BE YOU GOING, "THAT'S HOW I EAT..." - WELL, I'M HOPING-- - THAT'D BE A WEIRD WAY TO EAT. THAT'D BE A WEIRD WAY TO EAT FOOD. IT'S KIND OF A GOOD WAY TO EAT OTHER THINGS. I MEAN, ONLY ONE OTHER THING, REALLY. AFTER THIS BRIEF COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTION, WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE BENSON INTERRUPTION. - WELCOME BACK TO THE BENSON INTERRUPTION. I'M BUSY INTERRUPTING T.J. MILLER. HEY, I'VE GOT A GOOD IDEA. LET'S HAVE A TWEET-OFF. LET'S DO IT. YOU GUYS WANT TO HEAR SOME TWEETS THAT T.J. AND I HAVE WRITTEN. WHAT'S YOUR-- WHAT'S YOUR NAME ON TWITTER? - MY NAME IS NOTTJMILLER. IT'S @NOTTJMILLER. - SO WHAT IS IT THEN IF IT'S NOT T.J. MILLER? - BOY, IS THIS THE WHOLE END OF THE SHOW? - IT'S--YEAH, JUST GONNA DO TEN MINUTES OF ABBOTT AND COSTELLO-LIKE ROUTINE ABOUT TWITTER. - WHAT'S YOUR NAME ON TWITTER? - NOTTJMILLER. - NO, IT'S NOT. THAT'S MY NAME. MY NAME'S NOTTJMILLER. - BUT MY NAME'S NOTTJMILLER. IT'S DOUG BENSON. ALL RIGHT, SO I'M @DOUGBENSON ON TWITTER, AND HE'S NOTTJMILLER ON TWITTER, AND LET'S... YOU GOT ONE READY? YOU WANT TO READ ONE? - YES, LET'S DO IT. - ALL RIGHT, HERE'S ONE THAT YOU'LL LIKE 'CAUSE YOU LOVE MOVIES. A MOVIE ONE. - I LIKE THAT. WHAT WAS WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN? I FORGOT. - IT WAS THAT MOVIE WITH THE PEOPLE THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER, 'CAUSE THE MOVIE WAS SO TERRIBLE. WASN'T IT, LIKE, DANNY DEVITO AND MARTIN LAWRENCE? - REALLY? - I DON'T THINK SO-- - YOU'RE TWEETING ABOUT MOVIES FROM, LIKE, TWO DECADES AGO? - YEAH. - IT'S A REALLY OLD MOVIE. - YEAH, IT'S AN OLDER MOVIE--'90s. I THINK IT WAS '94. - ALL RIGHT. - ALL RIGHT, HERE'S A MOVIE ONE. - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, T.J. MILLER. - THANK YOU. - YAY. MY NEXT GUEST IS THE AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK CALLED IN 50 YEARS, WE'LL ALL BE CHICKS. YEAH, THAT'S INCLUDING THE LADIES. AND HE'S ALSO BEEN A GUEST ON MY PODCAST, DOUG LOVES MOVIES, AND HOSTS HIS OWN PODCAST. PLEASE WELCOME MY FRIEND ADAM CAROLLA. - THANK YOU. I GOT A STORY, DOUG. - REALLY? - YEAH. - ALL RIGHT. LET'S HEAR IT. - YOU'RE GONNA ENJOY IT BECAUSE IT INVOLVES MOVIES AND POT. - WIN-WIN. - YEAH. DOUG'S SO HIGH RIGHT NOW, HE'S THINKING, "THOSE ARE MY THREE FAVORITE THINGS." MOVIES, AND, POT. BOOM. - WOW, MAN. SO IT'S A SUNDAY MORNING. IT'S ABOUT FIVE MONTHS AGO, AND I'M WATCHING THE TELEVISION WITH MY WIFE. AND A COMMERCIAL COMES ON FOR SEX AND THE CITY 2, AND IT SAYS, "COMING TO THEATERS MAY 27TH." AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S SOMEWHERE IN MARCH, MY BIRTHDAY'S MAY 27TH, SO I JOKINGLY ANNOUNCE TO MY WIFE, "WELL, WE KNOW HOW I'M SPENDING MY BIRTHDAY." OF COURSE, SMASH CUT TO MAY 26TH. I'VE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THIS PROCLAMATION. YET MY WIFE HAS CALLED EVERYONE I KNOW AND SAID, "ADAM'S DYING TO SEE THE OPENING NIGHT "OF SEX AND THE CITY 2. "WE'LL BE AT THE ARCLIGHT HERE, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF HOLLYWOOD." AND OF COURSE, JIMMY KIMMEL, WHO MUST ATTEND EVERY BIRTHDAY-- IT'S MANDATORY WHEN YOU'RE GAY LIKE WE ARE. HE'S--EVERYONE'S PISSED OFF ABOUT IT. NOW, NO ONE IS HAPPY ABOUT THIS, AND NO ONE KNOWS IT'S A JOKE THAT I MADE TO MY WIFE THAT SHE SWEARS, "I DIDN'T--" BY THE WAY, "I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE KIDDING." REALLY, BITCH? YOU DIDN'T KNOW I WAS KIDDING? MADE FUN OF THE FIRST ONE FOR THREE YEARS. YOU DIDN'T KNOW I WAS KIDDING ABOUT THE SECOND ONE? OKAY. - NOW, BE CLEAR THAT YOUR WIFE'S NAME IS "BITCH." - YEAH, YEAH. - YOU WEREN'T-- YOU WEREN'T, LIKE, BEING RUDE OR ANYTHING. - SHE SPELLS IT WITH A "Y," BUT, YEAH. - THAT WOULD BE PRETTY COOL-- BITCH CAROLLA. - LIKE, "I'M WAITING ON MY BITCH," AND, "HEY, BITCH! GET BACK TO THE-- I'LL MEET YOU AT THE CAR." - HOLD ON, ADAM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THESE COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS. - WELCOME BACK TO THE BENSON INTERRUPTION, WHERE I AM INTERRUPTING ADAM CAROLLA. ADAM. - SO MY WIFE, DECIDED TO TELL TEN OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS THAT WE'RE ALL GONNA GO SEE SEX AND THE CITY 2 FOR MY BIRTHDAY. EVERYONE'S BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED. BUT, THEY'RE GOING ANYWAY, 'CAUSE THEY'RE TROUPERS, AND WHEN WE GET TO THE THEATER, SOMEBODY HANDS ME ONE OF THOSE POSTAGE-SIZED STAMP THINGS OF MARIJUANA. DOUG, DON'T GIVE ME THE "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" - YEAH, I HAVEN'T-- I HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED THAT. - YEAH. - IT'S LIKE A BREATH STRIP. - YEAH, RIGHT, RIGHT. - BUT YOUR BREATH ISN'T MINTY AFTER YOU USE IT. - NO, IT'S BONG-Y. - YEAH. - IT'S BONG-Y. - YEAH, IT SMELLS LIKE A BONG TIPPED OVER IN YOUR MOUTH. - IT IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR HOW HIGH YOU ARE GONNA BE IN THE NEXT 15 TO 25 MINUTES AND HOW HIGH YOU'LL REMAIN THROUGH THE ENTIRE MOVIE AND THROUGH DINNER FOLLOWING THE MOVIE AS WELL. IT TURNS OUT YOU DO ENJOY IRONIC THINGS MORE WHEN YOU'RE HIGH AS A KITE. AND, THE OTHER THING THAT WAS FUNNY TOO IS KIMMEL BOOKED JUST ALL-- HE BOUGHT ALL THE TICKETS, AND ALL HE COULD GET WAS THE FRONT ROW. AND THEY'RE LIKE-- EVERY TIME A GUCCI HANDBAG COMES OUT, THEY'RE LIKE, "WHOO, YOU GO, GIRL." AND AT A CERTAIN POINT, WHEN THE POSTAGE STAMP KICKS IN, I'M KICKING IN TOO, LIKE-- SO I'VE, FINISHED OFF A COUPLE OF TUBS OF POPCORN, AND I'M SCREAMING-- AND I GOT TO TELL YOU. I ENJOYED THIS FILM IN THIS STATE. I-I REALLY DID. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW. - YES, EVERYTHING IS MORE FUN... - RIGHT. RIGHT. - EVEN-- EVEN SEX AND THE CITY 2, AKA "DRAG ME BACK TO HELL." - RIGHT. - SO, NOW THERE'S A LITTLE PROBLEM, THOUGH, 'CAUSE THE PARTY IS GONNA END IN A COUPLE OF SECONDS, WHICH IS-- SO I'M HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE. I'M HIGH AS A KITE. BUT WHEN WE'RE LEAVING, JIMMY AND I ARE WALKING OUT AHEAD OF THE GROUP, AND I SAY, "WHERE ARE WE GOING? HE SAYS, "I GOT RESERVATIONS "AT A RESTAURANT JUST UP THE STREET. WE'LL JUST WALK." AND I SAID, "ALL RIGHT." SO I'M STILL HIGH AS A KITE, AND WE'RE WALKING OUT OF THE THEATER. AND AS SOON AS THE DOORS OPEN AND WE SPILL OUT ONTO SUNSET-- SUNSET BOULEVARD, SOME GUY WITH A CAMCORDER POPS OUT OF THE BUSHES, SHINES THE LIGHT IN MY FACE. HE'S FROM TMZ, AND HE'S LIKE, "HEY, MAN SHOW, WHAT WERE YOU DOING AT THE OPENING NIGHT OF SEX AND THE CITY 2?" AND I'M SO HIGH AND FEEL SO HORRIBLE AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT AND REALIZE THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE ENTIRE JOKE PART OF THIS. ALL HE KNOWS IS THE TWO GUYS FROM THE MAN SHOW ARE WALKING OUT ARM IN ARM FROM THE OPENING NIGHT-- - THAT WAS KIND OF UNNECESSARY-- THE HAND-HOLDING AND THE SKIPPING. - WELL, WE WERE MORE MINCING THAN SKIPPING, BUT I STILL-- I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, YEAH. SO IT'S MORE OF A FLUTTER THAN IT WAS A SKIP, BUT I GET YOUR VIBE, DOUG. UM, SO HERE'S THE-- HERE NOW-- SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. SO THE GUY WHO SAID, "HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING "WATCHING THE OPENING NIGHT OF, YOU KNOW, SEX AND THE CITY 2?" AND, THERE WERE SIX OTHER MOVIES SHOWING THERE. I DON'T KNOW-- THIS GUY CHECKED THE TIMES OR SOMETHING. AND WE JUST ROLLED WITH IT. I'M JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW, "PEOPLE SAY I'M A MIRANDA, BUT I THINK, I'M MORE OF A TERRY." NO, WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT'S THE OTHER CHICK'S NAME? I WAS TOO HIGH. WHO? - CARRIE. - YEAH. - CARRIE. - CARRIE. I'M THINKING OF TERRY BRADSHAW, THE NFL GREAT. THAT'S HOW-- THAT'S HOW GOD DAMN STRAIGHT I AM, LADIES. - WHOO! - CONSTANTLY OVERCOMPENSATING SINCE SEEING THIS MOVIE. BUT, UM-- - SAMANTHA. - SAMANTHA. SO THE-- - AND THE FOURTH ONE. - THE FOLLOWING-- AND JIMMY'S PLAYING ALONG-- "CAN'T A COUPLE OF GAY GUYS HAVE A NIGHT ON THE TOWN WITHOUT BEING BOTHERED BY TMZ," AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF? AND WE WENT SO OVER THE TOP WITH IT THAT WHEN I SAW IT ON TMZ THE FOLLOWING DAY, HARVEY LEVIN SAID, "WAIT A MINUTE. "WERE JIMMY AND ADAM REALLY AT THE, OPENING OF SEX AND THE CITY 2?" AND THEY ALL LAUGHED AT HIM. AND THEY SAID, "NAH, COME ON, THEY WERE SEEING ANOTHER MOVIE. DON'T BE AN IDIOT." AND I WENT, "WOW, THAT WAS A BULLET DODGED." BUT THEN I REALIZED... - THIS IS A GREAT TECHNIQUE, GUYS, FOR ANY KIND OF LYING-- INSTEAD OF DENYING IT, LIKE, IF YOUR WIFE GOES, "HEY, MAN, WERE YOU CHEATING?" AND YOU GO, "W-W-WHAT? "I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. WHY ARE YOU POINTING YOUR FINGER AT ME?" THEN SHE'LL KNOW YOU'RE CHEATING. BUT IF SHE GOES, "HEY, MAN, WERE YOU CHEATING?" AND YOU GO, "YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I DO. "I LOVE CHEATING. "YOUR SISTER'S SUCH A HOT PIECE OF ****, "I JUST HAD TO TAP IT. YEAH. "OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT I DID. OF COURSE I WAS **** YOUR SISTER." - WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THESE COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS. - DOUG, AT A CERTAIN POINT IN THE SHOW, DON'T WE DO ONE OF THOSE, UM, WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM, JACK-OFFS? NO, NO, NO, TWEET-OFFS. - WHAT'S YOUR NAME ON TWITTER, ADAM? - I THINK IT'S-- I THINK IT'S ADAMCAROLLA. - I JUST THINK-- I THINK IT'S JUST-- - IT'S ADAMCAROLLA, YEAH. - YEAH, YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON TO KNOW WHAT YOUR TWITTER NAME IS. - YEAH, RIGHT. - SOMETIMES THEY'LL NEVER TELL YOU. - YEAH, I HAD TO BRING IN A PIECE OF PAPER, 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WORK MY PHONE. AT LEAST 80% OF THE TIME MY WIFE HANDS ME THE PHONE, SHE GOES, "AND BE NICE." - IT'S LIKE LIVING WITH HOUSE OR SOMETHING. - YEAH. IT'S BAD. - ALL RIGHT. - YEAH. WHOO! - WE SAW THAT ON BLU-RAY THE YEAR BEFORE. THAT'S HOW WE CELEBRATED MY 45TH BIRTHDAY, ACTUALLY. YEAH. - EVERY YEAR A DIFFERENT CHICK FLICK. - YEAH. NOW, THIS ONE STARTS OFF IN A WEIRD WAY, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW, WHY I STARTED IT THIS WAY, BUT IT STARTS OFF, "SPEAKING OF SLEEPING BAGS..." SO EVIDENTLY THERE WAS SOME CHATTER ABOUT SLEEPING BAGS. YEAH, IT WAS A TRENDING TOPIC THAT YOU JUMPED ON. - SURE. IT'S ESOTERIC. BUT I THINK IT SHOWS MY RANGE. - YOUR TWEETS, WHEN YOU READ THEM, THEY HAVE A LOT OF ACTING IN THEM. "BE NICE." - YEAH. - AND, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF ARM-WAVING THAT YOU CAN'T-- - IT'S CALLED ARTISTIC LICENSE, BUDDY. - YEAH. I LIKE IT. - WOW. WELL, YOU MAY HAVE WON THIS TWEET BATTLE, MY FRIEND, BUT I SHALL RETURN AND THIS TIME ARMED WITH AN iPAD. - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ADAM CAROLLA! - YEAH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANKS, BUDDY. THANK YOU. - OUR NEXT PERFORMER HAS ENTERTAINED THE TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ, AND YOU MAY RECOGNIZE HIM FROM HIS APPEARANCES ON THE SARAH SILVERMAN PROGRAM. HERE'S MY FRIEND, GRAHAM ELWOOD. - WHAT'S UP? YOU AND I OBVIOUSLY TRAVEL A LOT TOGETHER. SO I WATCH A LOT OF MOVIES IN HOTEL ROOMS AND ON TV, AND I LOVE THE LITTLE ONE-LINE DESCRIPTION THAT THEY HAVE IN CABLE OF A MOVIE, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S LIKE, A SERIOUSLY, LIKE, CLASSIC, REALLY COMPLEX MOVIE THAT HAS ALL THESE LAYERS TO IT-- THEY BOIL IT DOWN TO ONE SENTENCE THAT IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE MOVIE, IT WOULD MAKE NO SENSE, AND THEY ALWAYS, LIKE, MISS ALL THE IMPORTANT STUFF IN THE MOVIE. IT'S LIKE, A BOY RETURNS HOME FROM THE WAR TO TAKE OVER HIS FAMILY'S BUSINESS. THE GODFATHER. - UM, OKAY, UM... TWO WOMEN VISIT THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAND CANYON. THELMA & LOUISE. A FACTORY WORKER HELPS GET PEOPLE JOBS. SCHINDLER'S LIST. - UM, A YOUNG MAN HAS TO LEARN TO USE HIS OTHER HAND. EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. - DO YOU GOT ONE MORE? - A YOUNG LADY PLAYS PINBALL. THE ACCUSED. - SHE DOESN'T EVER PLAY IT, THOUGH, REALLY. - YOU'RE RIGHT. GOOD POINT. - AND ALSO, I WATCHED THAT MOVIE. WHY IN THAT SCENE-- WHY DIDN'T THE MACHINE TILT? - THAT ONE IS A DOWNER. LET'S THINK OF A MORE CHEERY ONE. I GOT ONE. A LONG BOAT TRIP. AMISTAD. SEE WHAT I MEAN? THEY HAVE TO BE-- - THAT WAS REALLY-- THAT WAS A REALLY UPBEAT ONE. THAT WAS A REALLY UPBEAT ONE. - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GRAHAM ELWOOD. DON'T GET HIGH AND FORGET TO VOTE. GOOD NIGHT.
