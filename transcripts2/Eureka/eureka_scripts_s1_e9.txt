 JO: He was just crossing the road, and... CARTER: This is what happens when you don't look both ways. (DOG WHIMPERING) He's lost a lot of blood. Why don't we take him to a real vet? We are the best in the world. He's got a lab in Section Three. Hey, hear that, buddy? We're going to fix you right up. Yeah. FARGO: You're going to love this. Well, after three years of development, I hope so. Have you decided on a name yet? I like Mental Mouse, because it forms a direct neural link

 between your cerebral cortex and the computer main frame. Bluetooth for the brain. It looks like a melanoma. That's because it's not turned on. So this transmits my thoughts directly to the computer. That's right. No need for a keyboard or a mouse. You think it here, it comes out there. Fantastic, except it doesn't work. What do you mean? Well, I'm trying to access your personnel file and it's not working. Why are you trying to access my file? To see if you're remotely qualified to be tapping into my cerebral cortex. It's not working because it hasn't finished mapping your brain yet.

 In an hour or so things will start popping up before you even know you want them. Now, these lines represent different emotions. Red for anger, blue for happiness, green for depression. So you've equipped me with a very expensive mood ring. I'll take it from here. It's not a mood ring. It maps emotions to better convert brain activity into commands. If you think about it... Fargo, look at the screen. Yeah, you can take it from here. My thoughts exactly. CARTER: Taggart's your world renowned vet? Graduated magna from the University of Melbourne. I thought you were a crypto zoologist. Well, the study of unknown species is more of a hobby. Which means he knows more about animals than any normal vet. It means he knows more about pretend animals. I can't fix this. Okay, let's take him to a real doctor. No, I said I can't fix it, but my little friends can. You've made friends with sand now? Not sand. Nanoids. Remember Carl Carlson? We've been able to reverse engineer some of his discoveries about cellular regeneration and adapt them to nanotechnology. Normally I'm opposed to animal testing, but in this case, I'll make an exception. So, you're going to treat Lowjack with itsy, bitsy robots? They've been programmed to analyze and mimic biological structures such as bone, tissue and hair. They're activated and controlled by ultra low frequency radio signals. Man, that's a little creepy. Told you he was good. Their programming is simple. Repair and replicate, just like human cells. They'll serve as sort of a living Band-Aid until his tissues can heal. I assume I can trust you to let Lowjack go once he's healed? There's no sport in catching him in this condition. Scout's honor. There are no scouts in Australia. Yeah, there are. And believe me, in the outback, you'll learn how to do a lot more than tie knots. I could tell you stories... CARTER: Prefer you didn't. Just take care of the dog. Will do, Sheriff. See you, Jo. Later, Tag. Tag? Shut up. Tag. Shut up. I've got you now, my furry friend. All the years you've tormented me. Mocked me. But look who's laughing now. All right. Truce then. But just till you're up and about. Dr. Stark? Kind of busy, Larry. Are you having any computer problems? Not till now. Yeah. You should probably get that mole checked. Could be a melanoma. Do you need something, Larry? I picked up a computer glitch in this area. It may require shutting down sections of the main frame to isolate the problem. I'll need your authorization. It's always something. Just pray it's not the Lorena Bobbitt virus. I'm sorry? It turns your hard drive into a three and a half inch floppy. (LAUGHING) Guess I'll get to it, then? Please. Lorena Bobbitt virus. Kills me every time. I still remember our first encounter. There we go. Ironic that animal testing created you, and now it saved you. But for a dog with 130 IQ, you should know to watch out for cars. You need to pay closer attention, mate. You'll wind up dead. That's how I've survived all these years. Attention to detail. (WHIMPERS) What the... How did you get in here? (SCREAMS) NATHAN: I'm telling you, Fargo. It's not working. It keeps bringing up stuff I'm not even looking for. FARGO: (ON SCREEN) Like what? What difference does that make? The subconscious is extremely open to suggestion. When I first tried it out, it kept bringing up Buffy fan sites, which I'm totally not into. Even on a subconscious level. Am I interrupting something? Actually, Dr. Stark and I were discussing a prob... Not even remotely. If you're here to invite me to the Lise Meitner dance, I might still be available. Okay, you are not here to invite me to the dance. No. What's in the envelope? Oh. And I see you've signed them. I just thought that seeing where we are right now, that maybe it was time. Okay. I mean, unless you think that... I think we should've done this a long time ago. I've just gotten so busy, sometimes the little things get lost in the shuffle. Little things. Right. And with everything that's happened between you and Carter... This has nothing to do with Carter. Well, I'll just put them in your box when I'm done. Fine, I guess that's it then. Unless there's something else you needed. No. I think I got what I came for. And remember, Jo, call me in two minutes. Not a second more. Hi! What are you doing here? Helping set up for the dance. What are you doing here? Sound check. For? The finale. I represent the band. You represent the band? Spencer. You know, he's actually a really good musician. Groundbreaking beats. Like Moby meets Devo. Moby, Devo, Spencer. No, not feeling it. We're still working on a stage name. But I have him booked Monday nights at Café Diem, and I'm working on a deal with iTunes. And as his manager I get 15%. And what's he getting? Well, nothing so far, but... HENRY: Jack. Hey. How you doing? CARTER: Good. How you doing? All right. So, you got roped into this too, huh? This is Eureka's most important event of the year. Are you really here to help set up? Yeah. Absolutely. I'd like nothing more. HENRY: In that case, and on behalf of Lise Meitner, I thank you. And if I knew who that was, that might mean something. She was an Austrian physicist who discovered nuclear fission, which then led to the invention of the atomic bomb. Oh, well, by all means, let's celebrate that. Meitner refused to work on the bomb, Dad. Oh. Tonight's dance is a tribute to her ingenuity, not what others chose to do with it. Her passion for exploration, her commitment to bettering the world is the ideal Eureka is meant to strive to meet. That's what we're celebrating. And celebrate we shall. Check out the subwoofer on this bad boy. What, that little thing? (CHUCKLING) Hey, bigger isn't necessary better. Yeah, you keep telling yourself that. The next sound you'll hear is me blowing your minds. (TECHNO MUSIC BLARING) Did he say mind or eardrum? Moby! Devo! (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hey, partner, what's up? Oh, hey, Allison. No, I was expecting someone else. Yeah. What? Seriously? Yeah, yeah. I'll be right there. Sorry, everybody. I can't stay and help. Duty calls. Your dad is the worst liar. Well, luckily I take after my mother. (CHUCKLES) ALLISON: Larry called security, but they only caught part of the call. What did he say? Nice. The rest was garbled. That's it? That's it. Oh. Yeah, that's what I thought. What? It's really creepy in there. That's some really sharp police work, Carter. Are you sure he didn't just go out for a smoke or to his car for a nap? Carter. Some people need their afternoon nap. Like me, for example. Carter. It's well documented, Allison. A siesta works. It increases worker satisfaction and productivity, and it's a dying art. Napping is not an art. Well, you haven't seen me nap. I take it to a whole new level. Stop stalling and get in the tunnel. I'd be a little bit more effective with the proper amount of rest. That's all I'm saying. Sheriff, I heard about Larry. I'm coming with you. Not that I don't enjoy your company, but why? He's one of my dearest friends. Really? Are we talking about the same Larry? Just because you choose not to fraternize with the support staff, doesn't mean others don't. Which is your loss, because Larry happens to be a very sensitive guy. You want to try out one of your new toys, don't you? I... I got a new GPS locator and night-vision goggles. I brought my hand-me-downs for you. Lucky me. CARTER: Watch your head. (GROANS) TAGGART: See anything? It's a long dark tunnel. Not really. That's because you don't have ultra infrared vision goggles. You got me there. It's not like Larry to leave his post. I've got a bad feeling. Given where we are, I have a bad feeling. About 10 more feet, we should hit a junction. We can split up there. Whoa. Hang on. Fine, you baby. We'll stick together. But it's far more efficient if we split up... Taggart! Shut up! You shut up! Just listen. (BUZZING) What is that? Sounds insectoid. Is that even a word? Yeah, I think so. (BUZZING) What's that? I don't know. But it got Larry. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Ow! We're going to need more firepower. Go. Carter. ALLISON: Hey, you guys need to come back. We have a problem. Yeah, more than one. (EXCLAIMS) ALLISON: A person is missing. We found his equipment in the service tunnel. I don't care if I'm missing. You don't go poking around a billion dollar main frame without asking me. And you do not send a cop and a glorified vet into the brain of Global Dynamics without following protocol. They're not even wearing clean suits. Well, Larry is still missing. What do you propose we do about it? I don't care what you do, just do not compromise the safety of this facility while you do it. Look, I didn't want to go in there in the first place. What is that? It's my threshold for incompetence. It looks like a melanoma. Get out. CARTER: Your hubby is in a mood. He's not my hubby anymore. I know, I know, he's your estranged husband. No, I gave him the divorce papers to sign, which is why he's in the mood. Seriously? Seriously. I'm just going to go check on my pooch. Call me if you need me, Sheriff. Yeah, I'll do that. Are you okay? Yeah, let's just focus on Larry. Sure. We'll start with the security footage and then we'll do a floor by floor sweep. If he's in the building, we'll find him. I'm fine. There you are. People are looking for you. (LOWJACK PANTING) Lowjack? How did you get out of your cage? I told them they were overreacting, but you should probably tell them you're here. Get back here, you mutt! Where in the hell did he go? (BUZZING) Did you hear that? FARGO: The last footage we have of Larry, he's entering the service corridor, then the abbreviated message. He never came out. He must be in there somewhere. I'm starting to wonder what else is down there with him. I've got an idea. Here's Lowjack locked up in his cage, but I just saw him up on Section One. At least I thought I did. He gave me the slip. That's the least of our problems. You lost your nanobugs? I didn't lose them. They escaped. Where did they go? Could they have gone in there? That's where Larry went. Taggart? I don't know how they got out. They were in deactivated sleep mode. It's not in their programming to initiate commands. Well, can't you use your remote control thingy and make them march home? I tried that. They're not responding. They must be out of range. Then you need to get within range. Inside the many miles of dark, creepy service tunnels. That's great. They can't get too far. The EM umbrella will keep them inside Global. What? What's that? Global Dynamics is protected by an electromagnetic barrier. It prevents anyone from broadcasting any non-secured signals out or sending them in. The nanoids can't breach the barrier without frying their circuitry. We just need to get within range of the remote control. You better get to it then. Where are you going? To tell Nathan I want to lock the facility down. The less area they have to move around in, the faster we'll be able to catch them. Dr. Stark. Is there something I can help you with? Dr. Stark, what are you doing? Why are you deactivating the EM barrier? Dr. Stark! No, No! (SCREAMS) Where is he? This is Allison Blake. I need to initiate security protocol lockdown, level three. Dr. Stark is unavailable. This is my call. (ALARM WAILING) What was that? Lock down. That's comforting, considering we're stuck down here. Yeah. Burst gun, just in case. Just in case what? Exactly. These nanoids, how many were in there exactly? I don't know. They're programmed to self-replicate using any available source of carbon as fuel. Where would they get the carbon? Is it in computer stuff? Piping? Carbon is in anything living. I'm something living. So am I. This just gets better and better. Nathan, where have you been? There's a situation. Escaped nanotechnology. I had to put us on lockdown. Carter and Taggart are searching now. Okay, please don't give me the silent treatment. It's obvious that you're upset with me. You know, I'm upset, too. Why don't we just talk about it? Some indication of how you're feeling would be nice. That would be an indication. Nathan, why is your skin so cold? (BUZZING) You hear that? Mmm-hmm. Got something. Yeah? We're getting closer. I think we're there. What is it? It's their carbon source. It's Larry, or what's left of him. Oh, no. (BUZZING) If you have that nanoid remote control handy, now would be a really good time to use it. Anytime. I don't know how to say this. It's not working. That's how. (BEEPING) I'm getting movement. Where? Right there. Lowjack? That's not Lowjack. TAGGART: Bad dog! Bad dog! There will never be enough showers for me to feel clean again. Did you know that was going to happen? Absolutely not. Maybe a bit. ALLISON: Get the hell off me! Stop. Nathan, what's wrong with you? Nathan, stop it! Nathan! Nathan, stop it! Yeah. That wasn't Nathan. What the hell was that thing? Things. Taggart's nanoids can apparently make copies of us now. You've got to be kidding me. No, they're on a binge. We found Larry. Or what's left of him. He's dead? Devoured. And they're using his body as a carbon source. Then where's the real Nathan? COMPUTER VOICE: Caution. Electromagnetic barrier is disengaging. Dead or alive, we have to find him. We will. I promise. How do these things work? I mean, one is harmless, but a million can eat Larry? It's called distributed computing. Each individual nanoid is like a brain cell. Now, the more there are, the smarter they become. They communicate with each other over very low frequencies and share the thinking workload. Yeah, but they're just tiny computers, right? I mean, they run off a program. Right. Repair and replicate. So they need fuel. Exactly. Wow. Excellent. So, that's what it was going to do? Take my carbon and run around looking like me? I don't think so. I mean, the nano Stark kissed you, right? I mean, kissing. That can't be a part of their programming. No, but it shows their exponential leap in intelligence and a great taste in women. It knew it was me. I could feel it. Okay. So Stark is the key, and that monitor in his office is still working, which means he's still alive. You're right. They just found him in Section Three. Where is he? In the master control room. Thank God. Open the door. He's locked himself inside. No, he locked us outside, or one of them has. You've got to get this door open. What's in this room? The computer main frame. Would the security system be in there? And the EM barrier. He could turn it off. ALLISON: Not without help. Even with the codes, it has to be shut down manually from three different entry points by someone with full security clearance. Someone like Stark? All right. We're good. All right. Back me up. Man. This is really bad. They've got Dr. Stark at exit five. Wait, exit seven and exit nine. Those are the shut off points. They're making a break for it. The EM barrier's down. There's nothing to prevent them leaving the building. Sir? All exit points have been breached. We have multiple Starks outside of the building. And I thought one Stark was bad. There's no stopping them now. ALLISON: We have to find them. TAGGART: They're replicating exponentially. You know the program. What kind of numbers are we talking about? By this time tomorrow, there could be thousands. Next week, millions. Millions of Starks? That's horrible to think about. Well, we obviously can't wait that long. Okay, weapons. What do you have that can knock them out? The EM burst guns are short range. We'll never get all of them. Do you have anything bigger? Aside from a nuclear bomb? No. You have a nuclear bomb? I didn't say that. Sound the warning system. Eureka's on lockdown. No one goes outside until every Stark is stopped. Yes, ma'am. Carter? That's the answer. What? Stark. I think we've established that, mate. No, I mean why replicate Stark? I mean, why not Larry or the IT worker or Lowjack? They found the perfect specimen. You don't go back to dogs after that. But he's not perfect. Have you seen his abs? Damn close. My point is, we can't stop every Stark out there, but we can stop the one Stark in here. Well, every minute we're looking for him, they're out there multiplying. But if we can find the original... If we can find Nathan, then maybe we can figure out a connection. Well, where do we start to look? I know, I know. Don't even say. CARTER: I never ever want to come down here again. TAGGART: Looks like they've all gone. He's got to be here somewhere. At this rate, it could take us all day. Hang on, I'm getting something. More nanoids? Different signal. Dead ahead, and it's not moving. Here we go. Stark! He's still alive. The last thing I remember was Larry attacking me. And after that, it's all a dream. I mean, one minute I'm kissing Allison, and the next, I was a dog. I think somehow your dreams are becoming reality, and I think it has something to do with that little glowing mole thingy. A neural interface system. It transmits my thought commands directly to the computer network. Is it possible that the signals got crossed? I'm going to kill Fargo. Get back here! How was I supposed to know that my Mental Mouse and Taggart's nanobugs shared the same frequency? Okay, so turn it off. Problem solved. CARTER: No! Wait, wait. What? We need to sever the connection. Well, unless it's our only connection. I mean, think about it. Your doubles are still out there and they're no longer responding to Taggart's remote control, so that gizmo might be our only way of reaching them. Your thoughts, your subconscious thoughts, your dreams must have been transmitted into their programming. Okay, so, they're responding to the last command they got before the signal went weak? In theory, yeah. Okay. What was the overall theme of your last dream? Oh, come on, Stark. This is no time to be bashful. Well, there were some wished fulfillment fantasies in there. Like? Allie and some other stuff. I need specifics. The usual. Power, success, control over everything. You dream about world domination? Not all the time. (RADIO BEEPING) Yeah? Go for Carter. Everyone's off the streets, except a whole lot of Nathan Starks. You may want to get down here. Over. How many? Too many to count. Over. All right. We're working on it. Hang tight. Ten-four. So, assuming that we can contact these things through Stark, what do we do? Stop them from communicating with each other. They'd be reduced to single cells. With no threat at all. So how do we do that? Interference. A loud enough, low frequency blast of sound. Something below human hearing. Say, in the two hertz range. Two hertz? Generating any volume, you'd need a massive speaker, at least eight feet in diameter. No. Bigger's not always better. Come on. We're running out of time. You sit here. Allison, you ready? I still don't understand what we're doing. Good. You four, I need you to go into the booth. Shut it, lock it, wait for my signal. Thanks. Henry. All right. Come on, guys. I need you to focus on bringing them here. Focus, Nathan. Command them with your mind. Summon them with your will. Conjure them with... Seriously? Sorry. CARTER: Just concentrate. It's not working. I can tell it's not working. He's too focused. His rational mind is overruling his subconscious. All ego, no id. Hey. You are stupid, selfish, egomaniacal sack of crap, and I am astonished that you have gotten as far as you have. Coming from you, that's a compliment. Okay, slight change of plan. Well, it's good to know the fate of the world depended on your last one. Hey, Spencer, could you play something romantic? No problem. We're going to serenade them into submission now? Just sit and watch. (SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) May I have this dance? Right place, very wrong time. Just roll with it. It may be our last chance. Could, maybe, I lead? (CHUCKLING) I'm sorry, it's habit. Have I ever told you how amazing you are? No. You're strong, independent, and smarter than 10 women put together. And I think another 10 times as beautiful. That's really flattering. I... Just realized what you're doing. I mean every word. What I'm about to do, I do for God and country. NATHAN: Very cute. All right, you can stop. It's not working. It's working. I said you can give it a rest. This is having absolutely no effect. They're coming your way, Carter. I repeat, they're headed your way. Do you copy? Hello? It worked. Yeah. No, no, no. They're coming. Oh. Yeah, right. I hope you have a plan. NATHAN: I look pissed. Oh, my God! Look at all of them! It's a miracle. CARTER: Wait for it. ALLISON: We don't have that much longer. Few more seconds. Carter! ZOE: Two more. That's it. They're all inside, Carter. Now! Spencer, now! (LOW RUMBLING) Dr. Stark, are you all right? Fargo, never ever, ever mess with my cerebral cortex again. No worries, mate. Okay, we'll get the wraps over here, please. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) And fruit, come with me, please. You okay? Good, good, good. Having a good time? Great! I think we'll drop some fruit here, please. Thank you. You know, I hate to admit it, but Spencer's pretty good. The kid's my ticket. The kid's your ticket? Way to be supportive. Oh... You're going to be your own ticket. I think Vincent's outdone himself, huh? You've outdone yourself. What? Allison? It was quite a kiss. It was just for show. Just to make Stark angry. Do I look that naive? Honest, there's nothing to worry about. I'm not worried. I mean, I'm not happy either, but... I don't know. I mean, maybe it's time. It's not like you and Mom are going to get back together. Hi. Just don't ever make out in front of me again. (LAUGHING) Thanks. HENRY: What do you think? It's nice. Nice? Well, with this crowd, I expected, you know, a little more than centerpieces and linen napkins. It sounds like you're starting to get used to this crowd. Spencer! Ready? (LAUGHING) Oh, wow! Only in Eureka. TAGGART: I guess that kiss made him realize what he was missing, huh, Sheriff? Yeah, I guess. No explaining some relationships. You look unbelievable. Thank you. Do you want to dance? I'd be honored. CARTER: Hey, buddy. Looks like it's just you and me, huh? That's it. That is the real you, isn't it? (BARKS) Yeah, never mind. I don't want to know.
