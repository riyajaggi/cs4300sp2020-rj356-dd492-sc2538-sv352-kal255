 No. Nope. Nope. Oh, my God, no. Carter, the XJ-55 assault cannon uses a 30-round magazine? On what planet? Less commentary. More addition. What's my score? 53%. Yeah! Third time's a charm. Third time's the F, again. No advanced weaponry for you.

 I have to know every gun in the rack? And what? You should get special treatment because you're the Sheriff? I see what's going on here. I know you feel you were passed over when they brought me in as Sheriff. And yet, I aced the exam the first time. Jo, it's not a contest. I was assigned here by Washington. If you have an issue, take it up with them. And give me the remote. Happy to. After you pass the exam. It's regulation, Carter. Okay, Jo, I'm the sheriff, which means I need your trust, I need your respect, and most importantly,

 I need the remote to the freaking gun rack! Sorry. You can't enforce the rules if you're not willing to follow them first. Better hit the books. TAGGART: Look at the size of this thing! It's a beauty! Nothing yet, mate. Spencer, start the movie already! I'm working on it. Crikey! HD. So many pixels, the human eye can't even see them. When that satellite reorients another seven degrees, (LAUGHING) TV heaven! FARGO: Spencer, how do you work this thing? Nobody touches the Master Commander. Vincent, we need food. Grub! Grub! Grub! Patience, heathens. Roasted jalapeno maize kernels with demiglace, get them while they're steamy. But it's movie night. I need my popcorn. Expand and indulge your palate, Fargo. Philistine. We're locked on! In seconds, a first-run flick destined for the multiplex will be coming to your local Spencer-plex. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING ON TV) Ripper! (MUSIC BLARING ON TV) (PHONE RINGING) You're the Sheriff. It must be for you. Jack Carter. Hold on. Who's being too loud? Spencer? Yeah. It's Friday night. Did you ask him to keep it down? No, I'm not shirking my responsibilities. As a matter of fact, I'll send my deputy over right away. Not a problem. All right, bye. Spencer's movie night is getting a little rowdy. I handled it last time. Oh, good. Then you know the way. You know what they say about payback, right? She's a bitch? (MUSIC BLARING ON TV) JO: Spencer! Spencer! (LOUDLY) Hello? Officer of the law! What's wrong with you people? Turn it down! What? Why? Your neighbors are complaining about the noise! Which neighbors? The state of Idaho. Turn it down! Have a sit, Jo. Like a tinnie? Vinnie, get Jo a beer. I'm on duty. I can respect that. Like it to go? MAN 1 ON TV: Looks human, but it's just a guise. I've seen it. It's hideous. Under the skin. WOMAN ON TV: My God! What do they want? Us, our planet, our water. Maybe it's fuel to them. What was that? (WOMAN SCREAMING ON TV) JO: What are we watching? They Came to Conquer. When did that come out? Next week. Picture's amazing. Yeah, it is. He's just the host. The creature's protected inside. How do we get it out? We cut it out. (WHIRRING ON TV) MAN 2 ON TV: No! No! (MAN 2 SCREAMING ON TV) (FLESH RIPPING ON TV) Maize kernel? Wow! I mean, that is, like... Unbelievable, yet believable. Definitely. Like being there. Oh, man, I gotta go. Hey, you guys keep it down, okay? I'll walk you out. You know, in case of alien invasion. Strength in numbers. Right. Spencer, that was a life-altering experience. Hey, guys! Hey! Don't forget, next week's noir night. VINCENT: Sounds good, Spencer. Six hours until I have to go to work. Nathan? Allison. It's late. It's 7:00 in the morning. Oh. Have you been here all night? Yeah, I guess I got a little caught up. How's the budget going? It's not. I have to justify a number that will keep Global cutting edge... No. ...but still give Congress something to slash. You saw what they did to NASA. So when does Congressman Faraday get in? He's in. Flew in from McChord Air Force Base last night. He expects hard numbers and a field test of the PX-319 Project at 9:00 a.m. Hopefully, he'll be impressed. No, hopefully, he's forgotten that you called him a shameless grandstander in front of the Defense Appropriations Committee. He brought that upon himself. The man's smart, but he likes the sound of his own voice too much. (SCOFFING) Who does that remind me of? Well, maybe a little groveling will help. Whatever it takes. Global's future is all I care about. That sounds familiar, too. This has to go smoothly, Allison, and not just for Global. Maybe you can talk to Sheriff Carter, see if he can keep things quiet around here, for a change. I'll see what I can do, Nathan. Nothing like a little Vin-spresso to start the day off, huh? I'm waiting. For what? Come on! You're a woman. You're making small talk. You're buying me coffee, which means either, A, you're into me, or, B, you want something. Could you be more sexist? Come clean, or I'll make my own assumptions. Okay. Allison Blake, really into me! All right, we have... Allison Blake... Spread it around. We have a visitor in town. See, was that so hard? We do? Congressman Faraday, he got in last night. Huh. And you're telling me this why? We're under a budget review. Faraday's tour has to go smoothly. Nathan would just like you to keep a lid on things. He has great faith in your abilities. No, he doesn't. No, he doesn't, but we still need a day or two of quiet. In this town? It's easier said than done. Sheriff, something's happened to Spencer. Oh! Oh! I didn't hear that. What's wrong with the monkeys? They should be at each other's throats, but they look fine. They are fine. The device isn't. Are you trying to sabotage me? Stark's on his way now with the Congressman. I'm running diagnostics, but nothing seems... No "buts!" If you can't get the job done, Dr. Sharat, I'll find someone who can. You realize I don't work for you, right? In fact, you work for everyone else. Now I have to tell Stark we have nothing to show Faraday. If I go down for this, I'm taking you with me. Fargo, I think you're... Stop making this about me. This is sabotage. Dr. Stark, I'm afraid there's been a delay. NATHAN: My office, 15 minutes. I want a detailed explanation, and it better be good, Fargo. So, Congressman, as you can see, everything we do here at Global Dynamics is about pushing the boundaries... Of the scientific frontier. Yes, I read the brief, but we both know what it's really about. Cranking out the best war toys before our enemies do. That'll prime your funding pump. I know. And our PX-319 Project will revolutionize the way we engage enemies in battle. So you keep telling me. How about we skip the science fair and get right to it, then? We're preparing a simulated field test as we speak. It should be ready a little later. Then, I suppose we'll see about your funding a little later. I may be overreacting, but four years, he has never, ever been late. Let's do this. CARTER: Jo, put away your gun. And walk into a potential trap? I don't think so. She's not normally this high-strung. She has some issues. No signs of a break-in. Wow. What a relief. Did you see anything last night? Last night? Movie night. Right. Jo? What are you implying? Nothing. Can you kill the flashlight? I'm investigating a crime scene, following procedure. Maybe you should try it sometime. Can you maybe dial it down until we figure out that there's been a crime? Obviously, I can't dust that for prints now. Or that. Wallet and PDA. Well, he probably hasn't gone far. Unless he was taken, by force, against his will. Okay, no more coffee for you. Is that blood? Yeah. We gotta find him. Let's go. Yeah, he's just pulling in now. Good. Beverly, I am not asking you to do anything inappropriate. Of course not. I'll just keep my eyes and ears open, like you said. He has a tremendous amount of say over our funding. It's all in the town's best interests. I completely understand. What do you think you're doing? Nothing, Congressman. Then what's in your hand? Nothing. Really? Don't lie. I was just looking for... You're hurting me. Then scream. You scream. You remembered. You're hard to forget. Spencer! Taggart, for God's sakes, pick up. Tag, where are you? We're too late. Spencer! Spencer! Spencer! It's too narrow for a tractor path. Yeah, these crops have been flattened, not cut. SPENCER: Help... Do you hear that? What? What? Spencer! (SPENCER COUGHING) CARTER: Spencer? Spencer! Spencer! Spencer, are you all right? What happened? I can't... I can't talk about it. Why not? They're watching. Spencer, what happened to your hands? They left me here. Who? I can't... I can't... Spencer. You're not alone. He's clearly traumatized. Well, maybe Beverly can reach him. Yeah, all right, I'll take him there. Henry, you okay? No, but I will be once he is. Keep me posted. What do you think? Well, he probably passed out. Friends played a prank on him. Really? Come on. There's always a logical explanation for these things. Yeah, that sounded very logical. Okay, Jo, what's your theory? Well, it's a crop. Yeah. And there's a circle in it. No. No, no, no. I don't care how weird this town gets. There's one thing that I know, and that's that there are no aliens. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Yeah? Jack Carter. Oh, hey, Allison. That makes two today. I know. I know. I know. You don't want to hear about it. Okay, I'm on my way. Someone else disappeared. Fargo. That's one thing I can scratch off my to-do list. Or keep it on there for later. We're clean? Nothing about what we just did was clean. You know what I'm talking about. I sweep every room, every hour. No one can hear us. The Consortium believes the artifact was excavated and moved. To Eureka? To Section Five. Well, even you can't get access to that. No, but Nathan Stark can. You think he'll just take you on a tour? If there's something worthwhile in it for him. You'll need leverage. That's why I'm here, Dr. Barlowe. You know him better than anyone. You'll need to barter with the one thing he loves more than anything. Allison Blake? Science. Stark lives to push boundaries to leave his mark. He can't do that without funding, so... So his sin is pride. I heard somewhere it comes before a fall. (DOORBELL RINGING) HENRY: Please, help him. Spencer? Spencer, you know me. You're safe here. You can talk to me. No, let the bill die. I'll reintroduce it with my name on it. We'll attach a rider. It'll make our mutual friends happy. Okay. Spencer, what is it? Nothing. I didn't see anything. Okay, Dr. Stark. I'm ready to be impressed. You will not be disappointed, Congressman. Allison, could you... Oh. Okay, I'll catch up. Sweetheart. Hey. So how's Spencer? He's been better. How's Fargo? The last person to see Fargo was Dr. Sharat, and he missed a critical meeting with Stark. It's not like him. Spencer was acting odd, too. I need to talk to Dr. Sharat. No, that's gonna have to wait. She's kind of in the middle of something important. Well, so am I, and you called me, so... By decade's end, wars will be fought from command screens such as this one. There will no longer be a need for massive troops on the ground. Dr. Sharat? The PX-319 transmits a low frequency signal that delivers a subconscious message of fear and paranoia to the amygdala, deep in the brain, causing the enemy to turn against one another in a violent rage, as this demonstration will show. Just... Just one moment. A violent rage. This is worth 80 million. Dr. Sharat? The satellite's telemetry must still be off. Still? Fargo didn't tell you? We had a meeting. He didn't show up. Just give me a few minutes. That's all right, Dr. Sharat. I've seen enough. Dr. Stark, a word? So I understand you spoke to Douglas Fargo this morning? The man has lost his mind. If you find him, shoot him. (CELL PHONE RINGING) I'll take that as a yes. Thank you for your time. Nice monkeys. Carter. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Vincent did what? Perfect. Vincent just... No, I don't want to hear it. Jo, I need you to get down to CafÃ© Diem. Vincent disappeared during the lunch rush. Jo, come in. Over. Jo? Okay, today is officially Missing Persons Day, but you don't want to hear it. A day or two of quiet wasn't an unreasonable request. Look, Nathan, you need an ally on the Defense Committee. I'm ready to be that ally, but you've got to show me something worthwhile. Then I will have that demo ready for you shortly. Forget the demo. I'm talking about Section Five. Access to Section Five is by special clearance only. Which you can give me. Nathan, I want you to get your funding, but I'm not just going to rubber stamp a multi-billion dollar budget like my predecessors have, and I can't, in good conscience, support something I've never seen. It's that simple. There you are. I've been trying to raise you all morning. I've got it under control. (LAUGHING) Really? Because every time I turn around, someone else has gone missing. There's Fargo, now Vincent. Look, I know, and I know what needs to be done. What I don't know is why you insist on telling me how to do it. What is your problem? My problem is you. Sheriff Cobb treated me like a partner, not an appendage. When something goes wrong around here, people look to me. They don't know you. They don't trust you. Because you don't trust me. You've been on a tear since day one. I think you need to back off. Okay, I'm sorry you're pissed because you didn't get the job, but right now, I really don't care. We have to find these people, and I know, we're going to, but we have to work together, okay? Are you with me? All right, we'll work together. Okay, good. So we're okay? Yeah, we're okay. Okay. HENRY: Carter! Carter, wake up! What the hell are you doing? What am I doing? I found it out by the crop circle. I think Spencer spent the whole night rolling it over the fields to make them. That explains why his hands are so messed up. It's a little difficult to breathe with you camped out on my diaphragm. Right. Sorry. You all right? Yeah. (GROANING) Jo. It was Jo. Jo hit you? Yeah, with the butt of an MPS auto-assault-12 shotgun, or a model 50 tactical-takedown rifle. Damn, I'm never gonna pass the test. Oh, no. Tell me this wasn't filled with weapons. No. No, it wasn't. You're lying to me, aren't you? Oh, big time. What is going on? Well, let's see. Spencer thinks aliens have landed. Vincent and Fargo are missing, and Jo is gone G.I. Joe. You think they're all together? I think they were together at Spencer's party, and something happened. Either that or we are being invaded by aliens. Henry, please tell me you don't believe in aliens. No, I believe in Occam's razor. It's the basis for methodological reductionism. Oh, yeah. Slowly. Still dizzy. Okay, given two equally predictive theories, you choose the one that has fewer assumptions. So a tree has fallen in the forest after a storm. The first hypothesis holds that that tree was blown down by the storm. The second, rival hypothesis claims that that storm forced an alien spaceship to crash into the tree. See? No. I need to look closer at Spencer's trailer. I'll go. Okay. That'll give me a chance to get over to Beverly's. What for? I've got four people who are probably together and definitely armed. Spencer's the missing member of that team, and they probably want him back. Be careful. You, too. COMPUTER: Welcome to Section Five. We're doing the right thing, Dr. Stark. I'm counting on it. Step onto the grid for identity verification. That's a radiation symbol. Once you enter the chamber, we'll breach containment. You'll have 15 seconds to view the artifact. Any longer, we'll exceed exposure limits. You're not going in with me? We could only afford one suit. (SIGHING) Opening the doors now. NATHAN: Our tests have confirmed that it is terrestrial in origin. We just can't figure out who created it. Oh, my God. That's one theory. Then we strike, hard and fast. Your basic grab-and-go. He won't be alone, so watch your asses. Move out. Okay, so what makes you think Jo and the others are coming for Spencer? Occam's razor. You're spending way too much time with Henry. I borrowed this from Section Four. I want to stop them, not vaporize them. It's a PEP, pulse-energy projectile rifle. It's for crowd control. Completely non-lethal. Did you pass that weapons test? It's not that hard, Carter. Allison, Sheriff, what is going on? Where's Spencer? Inside, and he's getting worse. What happened to your head? Had a trust issue. Their leader is here. He looks human, but it's just a guise. You can see it. Hideous. Under the skin. We will not let anything happen to you, Spencer. Will we, Sheriff? No. I can stay positioned in the foyer. Allison, why don't you take the back and PEP the hell out of anything that comes from behind? Okay. He picked Eureka for a reason. He? He can't be trusted. I... I need to... I need to go. We have to capture and interrogate him. He must be stopped. Who? Their leader. He's infiltrated our government, and now he's here, hiding in plain sight. Oh, jeez. ALLISON: What? He's talking about the Congressman. He is? Spencer's not their target. Faraday is. That... I don't even know what to call it. It could change everything. It already has. Fargo? What the hell are you... Have you lost your mind? Deputy! Fargo! Who are you people? The question is, who are you? All right, that's... No. Nope. Aha. Call Carter. Henry, give us some good news. They were watching a movie called They Came to Conquer. Don't tell me, alien invasion. Invasion, abduction, dissection. This movie's got it all. Okay. Still, it's a big leap from watching a movie to thinking it's the real thing. ALLISON: Yeah, but we're talking about Spencer here. I'm assuming he didn't get this at Blockbuster. HENRY: Not even close. Looks like he hijacked a satellite signal to intercept a digital broadcast. Then he bounced the signal off a Global Dynamics satellite to cover his tracks. Oh. "Oh." Is that a good "oh" or a bad "oh"? HENRY: Now, the number of the satellite is GD-85. Oh, no. Don't tell me. That's the one that screwed up your monkey test. They lost the satellite signal for a few hours Friday night. I'm assuming... Spencer got it. Yeah. There's Nathan's car. Henry, we gotta go. Nathan. Are you all right? Hey, buddy. Stay down. Stay. What happened? Yeah, I'm gonna get you some help. Taggart, his deputy and my assistant took Faraday. Yeah, they're infected with your paranoia-inducing monkey beam. No, impossible. They were sent from a secure Global Dynamics satellite. No, possible. Spencer hacked into it. If anything happens to Faraday... CARTER: Well, it won't, now that we know where they took him. Where did they take him? Well, where would you go if you were about to do an autopsy on an alien? Taggart's lab. I'm calling Global's security detail. No, you're not. A crazy cabal is about to dissect a US Congressman. I am. They're not crazy. They're paranoid, and if they see a bunch of people with weapons, this is gonna be a Waco really fast. My point exactly. They're armed and dangerous. I don't see any other choice. Can't you just reverse the paranoid thing? You don't know how. I know how to save a US Congressman. Carter! This is Stark. Tell Task Command I need a detail sent to Taggart's compound. Code black. How many are you? We know what you are. We know where you're from, and believe me, by the time I'm done with you, we'll know everything else. Have you come to harm us? What do you people want? We want answers. (ALL CHATTERING) MAN: Let's go! Move! Set up a perimeter, standard breach formation! Let's go! Sheriff Carter, please stay back. I need to get in there. No, he does not. Let me negotiate this. I know these guys. So do I. Look, Sheriff, I don't like this any better than you do, but if something happens to that Congressman, what do you think is gonna happen to Eureka? We just need more time. Give us a chance to talk to them. I'm sorry, Allison. I can't risk it. Okay. Okay. If that's the way this has to be. Thank you for your cooperation, Sheriff. Carter! Sheriff, stop now! Hold your fire. Repeat, hold fire. Tell your people to lay down their weapons. I don't have any people. He's right. He's just the host. The creature's protected inside. How do we get it out? We cut it out. (POUNDING AT DOOR) (INTERCOM BUZZING) Who is it? It's Carter. I'm unarmed. Open the door. And what is this in reference to? Taggart, I know you have the Congressman in there. Copy that. We have the shot, Dr. Stark. Don't do it, Nathan. Give him a chance. Are you alone? Oh, yeah. Should we take the shot? Hold fire. We lost the target. JO: Come in. I hope he knows what he's doing. Come out of the house with your hands on your heads! Jo, any minute, this place is gonna be swarmed by the only people on the planet who are better armed than you. We'll do what we have to. No, you're gonna get hurt or worse. We can't trust him. He's one of them. Then don't trust me. Trust your own common sense. Oh, so, what, I'm stupid now? I know what I saw. You guys are suffering from a mass delusion. Nice try, mate. Think about it, Jo. What makes more sense, that he's an alien or that you guys are delusional? Shots fired. We need to move in. Not yet. I'm sorry, Allison. Go ahead. Okay, who gave Fargo a gun? Prepare for full breach. (WOMAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) (MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) You were all watching a movie in Spencer's trailer called They Came to Conquer, right? In which aliens invade a small, bucolic town in the Pacific Northwest. Spencer saw their ship, and he is their emissary. Taggart! Taggart! What Spencer saw was Congressman Faraday's helicopter arriving. His trailer is directly below the flight path. What time did you arrive? Congressman. Just after midnight. Okay. About the time the party broke up? Vincent? Spencer bounced the movie off a Global Dynamics weapons satellite that was being used to beam waves of paranoia into lab monkeys. There was a malfunction, wasn't there, Fargo? It failed. That's why you took off. Unfortunately, it didn't fail. When Spencer bounced the signal, you became the lab monkeys. We have the alien right here. Get out of our way. Maybe you do have an infiltrator, but it's not him. It's me. I'm the new guy, right? I didn't pass your test. I didn't see how much this town needs you. Fair. But I need you, too. You're not an appendage, Jo. You're my partner, and there's no one in this town that I'd rather have watching my back than you, and that's the truth. So please trust me. We're coming out! Hold your fire! Hold fire! Everyone, stand down! MAN 1: Hold your fire! MAN 2: Someone's coming out. WOMAN: Weapons down! MAN 3: Stand down! Stand down! CARTER: They're unarmed! Everybody's okay. MAN 4: Hold your fire! MAN 5: Copy that. Let's go! WOMAN ON RADIO: Coming out. MAN 5: Talk to us! Come on! Come on! So everybody's okay? Oh, no, they're freaking bug-nuts. Restraints, now. Right away. MAN: It's clear! (PEACEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) We reprogrammed the signal to stimulate the brain's pleasure center. I chose delivery footage each should find benign and peaceful. Well, you sure know Jo. Congressman, I trust this unfortunate incident in no way will affect our budget considerations? I was abducted, threatened and humiliated by your people, in your town, on your watch, but in spite of this incident, what I saw in there yesterday takes precedence. Dr. Stark, we'll be talking. I'm sure we will. Miss Blake. So are we funded? For now. I guess I owe you one, Sheriff, for getting the Congressman out relatively unscathed. A big one. Thank you, Carter. By the way, I didn't do it for you. You don't say. Multi-velocity XK exterminator. Very good. BMFG liquidator. And size of magazine? Trick question. It uses a single-chamber artillery. Wow, Carter, keep this up, and you're gonna pass the exam. Yeah, I don't know. I tend to choke the exam. Well, this is the exam. The manual didn't say anything about it having to be written, so I... Thanks for the tutoring. Don't mention it. (PHONE RINGING) You gonna get that? I didn't think so. Jack Carter.
