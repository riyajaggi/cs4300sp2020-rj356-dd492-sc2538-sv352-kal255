 NARRATOR: Previously on Eureka. HENRY: Walter was our top quantum physicist. NATHAN: Walter created some sort of tachyonic accelerator. Time as we know it, ceases to exist. Stark offered me a position at GD. Oh. NATHAN: You'll have 15 seconds to view the artifact. Believe it or not, it's terrestrial in origin. Carl, please, I have to know. What is it? One day, you will know. Will you be ready?

 All rover computer links are up and running. Mark time and date. 9:27 a.m. October 3rd, 2006. Let's take it for a test drive. Allison Blake. Jack Carter. What's up? My blood pressure. It's this suit, isn't it? No, it's Nathan Stark. He's trying to dodge jury duty by claiming scientific immunity. That sounds like Nathan. He's down in Section Five with Kim overseeing some big test. What kind of test? Do you care? Not really, just talking.

 Ready when you are. Open the door. We are at marginal proximity now. No change in core temperature or ambient emissions. Let's proceed. Igniting photon drill. Extreme proximity now. Still no reaction from the artifact. Moment of truth. (RUMBLING) What was that? I don't know. What's happening in there? I don't know. Systems are offline. Get them back online! I'm trying! Oh, my God. (MACHINE BEEPING) SARAH: Good morning, Jack. Morning, SARAH. It's 7:00 a.m. Yeah, give me 10 more minutes. You said that 10 minutes ago. And ten minutes before that. It's time to get up. Today's a big day. Everyday's a big day. I just need 10 minutes to face it. (MOANS) Sounds like someone doesn't want to face reality. Oh, no. I'm happy with my reality. Just not ready for it to change. Well, it's a little late for that, don't you think? I like things the way they are, that's all I'm saying. Taking a little trip down denial, are we? Look who's talking, little Miss I don't think Kevin should play football. That was not denial. That was responsible parenting. It was touch football, intermural, and I was the coach. Shut up. Just hand me my robe. (GIGGLES) You know, at my house, I had a real shower, not this sonic bombardment nothingness. I miss the feeling of actual wet water. Yeah, well, your house won't spiral into a depression if you move out. True. SARAH: I heard that, Jack. Oh, my God. What? You're huge! That's nice, very supportive. No, I just, you know, I'm going to have to build a new wing on the bunker. Twins run in your family? Does male pattern baldness run in yours? Well played. Hey, hey, seriously. You have never, ever looked more beautiful. You barely saved yourself with that one. Morning. Hey. Oh! SARAH, wheatgrass, please. Hey, does my hair, look... Never mind. Dad, I really think you should cut down on the caffeine. Yeah, well, I'll stop drinking caffeine when you stop drinking the lawn. So, you ready for your big day? No. You? No. Not even a little. So have you decided on the ultrasound yet? Yeah. Yeah, and I want to be surprised. It makes life a little more interesting. Yeah, well, life is plenty interesting around here. I think you're in denial. Yeah, that's what Allie said. Great minds. Yeah, yes, they are. Hey, Zoe? You're going to be great. Thanks. So are you. (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) Thank you to our distinguished salutatorian. And now it gives me great pleasure to present the valedictorian for the class of 2010, Zoe Carter! ALL: Zoe! Zoe! (ALL CHEERING) You know, nobody is as surprised as I am to see me standing here today. Except maybe my father. When I first came to Eureka four years ago, I was in the back of a police car, and luckily my father was driving, and being a man, he refused to stop and ask for directions, or we may have actually reached our destination. When I first came to Eureka, I was on my way home, and the irony is, by crashing here, I found one. Thank you for having faith in me. Thank you for making me and my dad a part of your family. I promise to do my share of the chores, and I'll try not to blow up the world if you don't. (ALL LAUGHING) Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you the class of 2010. (ALL CHEERING) Hey. Hey. So, how did I do? Not bad for a nutty professor. I'm sorry I have to miss the reception, but I have to get back to the lab. You're just afraid that your boss is going to find out you've been slacking off. No, I am not. I have him wrapped around my little finger. Is that right? Mmm-hmm. See you later. Bye. Zoe, congratulations. Thank you. All right, I've got to get back to the station. Someone needs to be on duty. I'm sorry your mother couldn't be here. Thank you for coming. Oh, you're coming to the party, right? With bells on. No, not just bells, right? You never know. (CHUCKLES) Hey, Kevin. Nice speech, sis. All my coaching paid off. Yeah, right. Congrats. Thank you. I'm going to head over with Wendy and Pilar, so I'll met you there. Right. Bye. Bye. Congratulations. Here, babe. Thank you. (SIGHS) The college thing is going to be easier, right? No, just more expensive. Yeah. I know this isn't environmentally correct, but I really miss my old jeep. Well, next time you won't ignore the tornado crossing sign. (RUMBLING) Did you feel that? Yeah. Earthquake? No, I don't think so. (CELL PHONES RINGING) Jack Carter. Allison Carter. It's Jo. Fargo. What? Who's lab? Section Five? Okay, yeah, I'll be right there. All right, we're on our way. One day. Is that too much to ask? There's always tomorrow. Yeah, I know. Rad sensors picked up a surge of exotic particles, and thermal scans are detecting something in the containment area that wasn't there before. What kind of something? We're not sure. It's organic, but visuals haven't come back online. Okay. Is anyone else in there? I don't know. What? You're not sure? Well, no. Well, Jack, maybe you should wait. I can't. There could be somebody in there. Be careful. It's hard to be carefuller. What? I know it's not a word. I don't like this. What's the matter, Jo? Scared of a little trans-dimensional radiation? Yeah. Okay. You guys take the computers. Bishop, come with me. Jo, take the hallway. Jo? Oh, my God. He's waiting for us. What did he say? Well, we found a body fused into the wall of a top secret area of Section Five. He was concerned. Was that sarcasm, Agent Carter? Perhaps, Sheriff Carter. Isn't this Carter-Carter thing getting just a little old? No, not yet. CARTER: Hello, Dr. Deacon. Hello. I'm sorry I had to pull you out of Zoe's party, but were we able to identify the body? That's not going to be so easy. Yeah. The weird part or weirder part is that the lab was empty, and then the body was detected. Whoever this is, they seem to have just appeared. All right, you two, let's see if we can determine from where. Dr. Deacon, are you okay? Fine. Scalpel. Bones are brittle to the touch. Internal chest cavity shows massive tissue damage. Organs are all but disintegrated. Let's get a tissue sample. I'm craving red meat. That's just wrong. Beefjerky. Okay, seriously, I think I just threw up in my mouth a little. I'm trying to concentrate in here. HENRY: It doesn't look very encouraging. What did you find? She's been exposed to an intense dose of radiation. What kind of radiation? Exotic particles. It's going to be extremely difficult to find an intact DNA sample. These are the same particles we picked up when Carl Carlson breeched the artifact containment chamber. Well, that's simply impossible. We ran every test, right? There was no sign of containment breech. But there was a radiation surge just before we found the body. There's only one place these could have come from, the artifact. Right. CARTER: There has to be some way to identify the body. In this case, the body's far too distorted. Without more to go on, we'll never know who it is. Kim. I'm sorry? Kim has been developing a DNA reconstruction program. That could work. I doubt it. Yeah. But it's designed to reconstruct entire contiguous DNA strands based on partial samples. But it's still in the early experimental stages. Yeah, but if she can put the pieces together, then we can rebuild our John Doe on a cellular level. What? I learn things. Let's go talk to her. I learn things. ALLISON: We need you to identify the body found in Section Five. Well, what happened? That's what we need to figure out. It's a long shot, so if you think it's impossible... Anything is possible. I'll just have to modify the existing software. Great. Look, why don't you guys go back to Zoe's party? If we get something, we'll call you. Okay. Great. ALLISON: Why do you say things like that? CARTER: What? Well, it's just... I was being polite. What's wrong? Nothing. Just concerned about all this stuff. Well, don't worry. I'm sure I can figure something out. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) One Newton Appletini and a virgin Margaret Mead 'cause you're on duty. Mead? Water, yeast, honey? Seriously, I don't know why I bother. CARTER: Yeah, good to see you, too. (EXCLAIMS) Unbelievable. Well, I don't work for the Consortium anymore, so if you want me, you'll have to do better than that. (RUMBLING) (CAR CRASHING) Wait here. Oh, no. Hey, are you okay? I don't know what happened. It came out of nowhere. Literally, one second it wasn't there, then poof! It just appeared. Okay, okay. Just sit tight for one second. Carter? Yeah. Wasn't this crushed by a runaway tornado? About six months ago. The security sticker is three years old. Don't be there. Don't be... What? What is it? No way. CARTER: Why am I getting déjà vu? FARGO: It's a lot of the same equipment we used to test the aftermath our last temporal anomaly. ALLISON: Temporal anomaly. We haven't completed our analysis yet, but it looks like a fundamental quantum instability. Oh, you mean like back what happened with Walter Perkins' time machine? (LOUDLY) Tachyon... (SOFTLY) Accelerator, Sheriff. Well, tomato, tomahto, that was years ago. You really think that's what's happening now? HENRY: No. Walter's machine has been locked up in a vault for four years. CARTER: Couldn't he have built another one? Walter's under house arrest. Even if he could get his hands on the right equipment, he's not reckless enough to do something like this again, especially, given his condition. Well, maybe he didn't do it, but he might know what it is. Either way, it's worth a chat. Waste of time. Call me if you come up with something better. (GUN FIRING ON TV) Can I get you something? Coffee, tea, Red Bull? No. Thanks, Walter, this isn't a social call. Didn't your mother ever teach you it's rude to stare? Sorry. It's a little disconcerting. I'm the only 40-year-old teenager in town. Don't tell me about disconcerting. Look, Walter, there's been some strange activity in town... You think it's the result of a temporal anomaly. Yeah. Which you think I have something to do with? Well, I hate to disappoint you, Sheriff, but it wasn't me. I'm under house arrest. The temporal stabilizer keeps me from getting any younger, but one foot outside that front door and it's set to shut off. I don't want to end up in diapers. Do you have any side projects you're working on that maybe I should know about? My last side project cost me my marriage and my family. Susan was pretty understanding about the whole cloning her thing, but no woman wants to be married to a 16-year-old. Well, it's a tad creepy, not to mention illegal. Besides, part of my sentence is no technology above a class two rating. Hell, I had to file for special dispensation just to get that Xbox. It's only a 360. Well, who besides you in town could be causing something like this? Well, I suppose anyone who knows their quantum physics and has access to my accelerator. How much longer? I have to get going. Why? Got a hot date? I date. Okay. I do. I believe you. No, I don't. I know. I'm almost done here if you want to take off. Any luck? Not in love. What? (LAUGHS) Don't ask. I finished the body scan. It's reconstructing the DNA now. Huh. What's wrong? I don't know. Something's off. This looks distorted to me. I think it looks pretty good. It's just going to take a little time. Maybe, but just try adjusting the base pair algorithms. Henry, I'm sure that's going to slow us down. Please. Trust me. I do. Okay. I don't know what I would do without you. Given young Walter's situation, I don't think he could possibly have started this. I'm finalizing your list of everyone with quantum physics background and Section Five clearance. Well, hopefully that will narrow down our list of suspects. It narrowed it down all right. How many? Take a look. Oh, man. Kim's made some progress, not very encouraging. Oh, hey, how did it go with Walter? He didn't do it. Are you sure? Yeah, positive. But I made a list of all the people who had access and the ability to cause something like this. And how many are on it? After eliminating Walter, two, and one of them is Nathan Stark. Well, he's been gone for four years. Who's the other one? Kim? What? I have something to show you. Well, this has to be a mistake. I mean, maybe the sample was contaminated? I've checked. It's no mistake. What we are looking at is definitely... You. Then again, you knew that, didn't you, Henry? Henry? He was the other name on the list. Henry, what did you do? So the body we found fused to the wall, that body right there, that's you? That's me. Which means you died four years ago. Apparently. But you're here right now. It doesn't make any sense. It does if Henry changed the outcome of the accident using Walter's machine. Henry? I lost her the first time to Jason. But we got a second chance. I couldn't let you go. They... They couldn't identify your body, so they brought me in to see if I could... It took days. So you used Walter's tachyonic accelerator to change history? That's insane. You lobbied for Stark's job to gain access... It was the only way. Nathan was never going to let me try this. He knew the risks. Well, what risks? Creating a paradox, an alternate timeline with a different outcome. What we're witnessing is two intersecting realities colliding, competing for the same space-time continuum. One where you died. One where I lived. But if that's true, we're living in the wrong time line. Yes. None of what we've known for the past four years was supposed to happen. No, but this is life now. Our life. Do you really want me to change it? Henry, you got to fix this. If you don't, things could get worse. Or they could equalize. Is that a chance you're really willing to take? I already did. Josefina, it's the most natural thing in the world. You just got to relax and be open to it. Trust me. I do trust you, but the whole idea just freaks me out. (PHONE RINGING) Lupo. You saw what? Where? (RUMBLING) (PEOPLE SHOUTING) What the hell was that? It's just the beginning. You found it where? Fused into the wall of the artifact chamber. And you're sure it's Kim Deacon. Yes. Can we talk about my mom now? I'm afraid we're out of time. When I snap my fingers, you will awake feeling refreshed, and will remember nothing about what we discussed here today. One, two, three. Which is why it's not even possible for me to be hypnotized. Well, Fargo, we'll just have to keep working on it. Any injuries? Okay, good. We're working on it. I'll call you later. Remember that tornado that took out my jeep? Yeah. It just popped up on Main Street and took out half the block. Okay, Henry has to stop this. I know, but he won't. But there is one person who might. I'll make the call. Okay. Thanks. MARLA: (ON INTERCOM) Dr. Stark? Yes, Marla. Allison Carter is on the line. She says it's urgent. Oh, should be interesting. Allison, what a surprise. Are you okay? I really don't want him here. Neither do I, but I also don't want the universe to unravel. No, I mean it. I don't want him to try to fix it. I know it's selfish, but I love our life. I love this baby. I know. Me, too. Well, well, well, if it isn't the Carters, and the little Carter-to-be. Pregnancy suits you. Yeah, it does. Hello, Sheriff. You ready to save the world? You ready? No. So, let me get this straight. I got fired for cutting corners on the artifact, but Henry gets to play with the space-time continuum? We didn't know what he was doing until after he did it. You realize that was a rhetorical question? I do now, yeah. So what are we dealing with here? A mess. Time is supposed to be fixed. A straight line. Start here, you end here, experiencing everything in logical order. Henry went back and changed history, thereby creating a paradox. A completely separate and different timeline. We know that much. What do we do about it? Not do. Undo. We need to stop Henry from saving Kim, thereby erasing this timeline completely. Okay, how do we do that? Someone's got to go back. Someone? Okay. Me. Glad we got that straight. Nathan, thanks for doing this. Everyone deserves a second chance. JO: You were right. This is really nice. I'm glad you changed your mind. I can't believe it took me four years to get you naked. Outdoors, anyway. What convinced you? I just knew it was time. You found me. Well, it's a big glass office. It wasn't hard. You heard about what happened downtown? I thought I could fix this. I can't. You had to know this could happen. You weren't going to tell me. I'd hoped I'd never have to. You know now there's only one way to make things right. I barely survived losing you the first time. I can't... I can't... I can't do that again. This isn't just about you or me. I can't. You have to. Well? Working on it. Work faster. Would you like to try, Sheriff? (SIGHS) All of the algorithms are correct. I do not know what is wrong. Maybe you're missing something. I'm not missing anything. Yes, you are. This. What's that? Nathan. The fragment I took from the artifact four years ago. You know something I don't, Henry? It's trans-dimensional. It exists completely outside our space-time continuum. So none of the rules apply. Right. Okay, and now for those of us who aren't astro-physicists. If the Big Bang was a plane crash, the artifact is the black box. It's the last remnant of whatever universe existed before our own. Technology light years beyond our own, but billions of years old. At the moment, physical time travel is impossible, but the transfer of consciousness from one temporal plane to another isn't. So you sent your mind back in time. More or less, yes. And now we have to do it again? No, you have to do it again. And, Nathan, I'm going to leave this in your hands. Oh, can't say I'm loving that plan. Where are you going, Henry? To say goodbye. Maybe Henry's right, and maybe things will equalize and things can stay the way they are. Henry knows things can't stay the way they are. Aren't you even a little afraid to lose me, to lose us? Listen to me. There's no time, no space, no way that we don't end up together. You just have to have a little faith. Even knowing what I know now, I would do it again. I know you would. We're running out of time, Carter. (MACHINE HUMMING) SARAH: Good morning, Sheriff Carter. Good morning, SARAH. I'm detecting an odd tone in your voice. Is everything all right? What day is it? Tuesday, October 3rd, 2006. Zoe. Don't freak out. Okay? I swear, I was up studying at Pilar's house and I fell asleep and... Okay, now I'm kind of freaking out. No, I'm just glad you're home safely. So you're not gonna ground me until I'm 30? No, not today. Cool. Zoe? Look, I'm not sure how this is going to play out, or even if I'm gonna remember it, but I want you to know that I will always be there for you. Okay. Is everything okay? It will be. Good morning, Nathan. Good morning, Beverly. Do you have something for me? I sure do. I finished the psych evaluations on the Global employees. Dr. Stark? They're waiting for you in Section Five. The big test? Excuse me. Allison. Hey, Carter. What's up? Just looking for Henry. I haven't seen him. You okay? Yeah, yeah. Hey! You look great. Thanks. All rover computer links are up and running. Let's mark the time and date. 9:27 a.m. October 3rd, 2006. Let's take it for a test drive. Jack! What are you doing here? I'm stopping you, Henry. We are at marginal proximity now. Let's proceed. Igniting photon drill. CARTER: You can't do this. Get out of the way. Henry! (GRUNTING) If you do this, the world will unravel. I can't let her go! I know! Moment of truth. (GRUNTING) That's why I'm here. Jack, I have to save her. You can't. It changes everything. What's happening in there? I don't know. Systems are offline. Get them back online! I'm trying! Jack, get the hell out of the way! (GRUNTING) I can't let you do this. If you don't, Kim dies. If I do, we all die! Oh, my God. (HENRY YELLING) No! No! (SOBBING) I'm sorry. No! No! No! MAN: What kind of accident? A breech of the artifact. A core sample was taken and Kim Anderson was killed. Do you have the sample? Not yet, but the biodegradable micro-transmitter I planted on Stark worked perfectly. Security scans never detected a thing, and now we know what we're dealing with. The Consortium will be very pleased. Do you have a plan for obtaining the sample? I always have a plan. That's why I'm here. You're here because we want you here. Do not forget who you work for. ALLISON: Hey. Hey. You doing okay? Yeah, yeah. (STUTTERS) I'm better than Henry. Yeah. I just hope that he can forgive me. Look, it was an accident, Carter. There was nothing you could have done. Yeah, I keep telling myself that. Look, I know it's hard to believe now, but things will get better. You just have to have a little faith. Allison, there's... What? Nothing. Come on. I'll let you buy me a cup of coffee. It's free. Oh, well, in that case, I'll buy. You know, I think this is definitely becoming our thing. We don't have a thing. We might.
