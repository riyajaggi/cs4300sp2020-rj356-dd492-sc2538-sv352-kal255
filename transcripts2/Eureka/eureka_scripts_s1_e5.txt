 (ALARM BLARING) I need to know. (SIGHS) I need to know. MAN ON RADIO: A huge round of thanks to all the volunteers... Carter. What you doing? I'm the sheriff. I'm sheriffing. You were supposed meet me at Global a half an hour ago for your physical. Yeah, good news.

 I gave myself the physical and I'm in perfect health. All right, it's mandatory. You can't be insured by Global without one. Yeah, now's not a good time. We're really, really, super busy. Okay, this is the third time you've put this off. What's up? Do you really wanna know? No, I just enjoy our morning banter. Because I don't want to die. Isn't that the whole point of taking the physical, Carter? No, that's tempting fate. Insure a cop today, he takes a bullet tomorrow. Oh, what are you, superstitious? It's not superstition if it's true, which it is.

 Okay, you know what? You're not grasping the point here. If you don't take the physical, you don't have a job. So, strip. We'll just do the physical here. Excuse me? Oh, we all have a past. This was mine. So, time's a-wasting. Drop 'em. I'm gonna need to see some credentials if you are a doctor. Was a doctor, before Kevin was born. But I still think I remember where all the main parts are. So drop your pants. No. There'll be no pant dropping without a nice dinner and many, many cocktails. (PHONE RINGING) Deputy Lupo. This is Carlson. Where's Cobb? Dr. Carlson... Calm down. Who is it? I'm trying to... Just breathe. ...standing here in the middle of... Okay, get a paper bag... What? Breathe into it. Who is that? Carl Carlson. He 911s all the time. We can ignore it. Not on my watch. Carter. Sorry, Allison. Gotta go. Protect and serve. Wait for it. Where am I going, exactly? Hello? Don't put me on hold or I'll kill you! Carl Carlson? You're not Sheriff Cobb. No. Sheriff Cobb retired. I took his place. There was a town meeting and everything... I gave a speech. I don't get out much. I'm gathering. Jack Carter. Do you have any idea how many strains of bacteria are transmitted by hand-to-hand contact? No. But I'm guessing you do. Oh, yeah, well, I'm really sorry, but I don't think this is gonna work out. I need Sheriff Cobb. You're still not Sheriff Cobb. Yeah, we established that. But since I'm here, what is your emergency exactly? I have to get to work. You called 911 to bum a ride? It's a very big day for me. Sheriff Cobb always used to give me a ride on very big days. Driving makes me very nervous. It's okay, Carl. I'm here. Client of yours? Six years running. Why didn't you tell me that there's a new sheriff? It came about rather unexpectedly, and I didn't want to panic you until we had time to process it. Yeah, well, now I'm panicking, because this is a defining day in my research and I have absolutely no way of getting to work! I'm sure Sheriff Carter will be happy to drive you. Yeah. You know, he is a former U.S. Marshal. Yeah. Yeah? Okay. Only if he puts the lights on. Well, that was surprisingly easy. He must like you. Beverly, I don't run a taxi service. He's on the verge of a major breakthrough. More like a major breakdown. He's pioneering the field of cellular regeneration. You would be helping him help everyone else if you do this. What are we waiting for? You're making me late. I used to have a real job. You're doing a good thing. Carl! And remember, lights but no siren. Right. Okay. I got you here in one piece. Well, next time, if you wouldn't mind cleaning out your car... There won't be a next time. Best of luck. What do you mean? You're not coming to my lab? No, I've got... Today's the day I go for all the marbles... I've got a thing and then I have another thing. Oh, 'cause Sheriff Cobb always used to. Okay, for the last time, Carl, I'm not Sheriff Cobb. I'm an officer of the law, and I just can't... Mr. Stark, can I get your signature, please? ALLISON: Carter! ...get enough of the science in this town. Oh, good! Yeah, so what is this breakthrough? It's a remarkable... I am so tired of that man. What is it with you and Carter? Not Carter, Carlson. The man's been here for six years, he hasn't produced anything. He's literally more trouble than he's worth. Is this really necessary? I can't risk introducing new strains of bacteria into the test area. Could you step back, please? I said step back. I'm attempting to achieve "adhesion affinity gradient" in the proximal blastemal cells in human tissue. I'm glad someone's on that. Yes. You know, when a lizard loses its tail, it grows back. It's called cellular regeneration. I'm trying to do the same thing with people. Well, that's cool. Beverly encourages me to take risks and not wimp out when I'm on the verge of something new. Moment of truth. One drop. One drop only. (SIGHS) Uh-oh. What do you mean "uh-oh"? (GROANS) ALLISON: If you'd come to my office for your physical, you might not have been hurt physically. Well, Dr. Blake, if you hadn't have tried to give me a physical, then I wouldn't have had to have gone through such extreme measures to avoid it. You got off lucky, Carter. Well, not as lucky as him. OFFICER: What happened? I don't know. It could be the new tungsten alloy rotor I installed in the centrifuge. It could be... You know what? Dichloride heptoxide is unstable when heated and that's what probably happened. In fact I'm sure that that's what happened. Probably happened. Allison, I'm gonna need Form 395 Tack Two-Charlie. Nathan... My call. He's all yours, Carter. All mine? What's Form 395 Tack Two-Charlie? Revocation of Government Clearances and Property. Carl is being fired. It is your job as sheriff to oversee the safe and orderly removal of all ex-employees from Eureka. What does that entail? ALLISON: Technicians from Global Dynamics will pack up anything that belongs to Dr. Carlson and confiscate anything that doesn't. They'll review his personal documents and redact any classified information. Dr. Carlson will then be scanned to make sure he's not concealing any classified materials. A Global Dynamics Human Resource counselor will provide Dr. Carlson with a new résumé, replacing his tenure at Global with a plausible government research project, complete with applicable references. Every molecule of my life has been erased. That's our goal. Have a good day. Don't touch me. I'm really sorry about this, Carl. Yeah, where am I gonna sleep? I'm sure Beverly has a place. Oh, she's not returning my calls. Besides, I cannot sleep in a public bed. If Sheriff Cobb were here, he'd let me stay with him. But he's not here. Step two... Carl, I happen to live in a hermetically-sealed military bunker... Perfect! Thank you! I'll just call Beverly and let her know where I'm staying, if I had a phone, 'cause I don't have one, 'cause they took it! So I don't have one. Can I borrow... Yeah... Thank you. I got a... CARTER: Hey. So, you moonlighting at Staples? Form 395 Tack Two-Charlie. Carl has to complete these before he's allowed to leave Eureka. Well, so much for your paperless society. Well, these will get filed with the DOD. They're not quite down with the "Save the Tree" mentality as of yet. Oh, and that's for you. Ow! Oh, yeah, it'll hurt a lot more if you try to take it off. What the hell is it? Wireless body sensor. In other words, portable physical. It's taking constant measurements of your vital signs, organ functions, and blood chemistry. I feel so violated. Oh, I'll be monitoring you. Allison! Blood pressure! Make sure he signs every page. (GROANS) Beverly, it's Carl again. Please, pick up if you're there. I know you told me that with risk come great rewards. Well, I'm having a little trouble seeing what those rewards are at this moment. Beverly, listen, I'm being redacted. I'm being exiled out of Eureka. You need to call me. Okay, well, actually, you'll have to call Carter's phone, not me, 'cause they took my phone. That was him. This is an unfortunate setback. It's okay. Carl Carlson may no longer be a viable candidate for our objectives. However, a new target has been identified. You asked to see me, sir? NATHAN: Yes, Fargo. I need you to lead the investigation on the explosion in Dr. Carlson's lab. Wow! Thank you, sir. I'm honored. Just keep the findings between us until I tell you otherwise. On the down low. Got it. SARAH, Door! SARAH: Welcome, Sheriff Carter. Hey, what's up? Organic Chemistry is gonna kill me. What happened to you? Organic chemistry almost killed me. Oh, we're going to have a houseguest tonight, so remember to pick up. Good going, Dad. Is it Allison or Jo? SARAH, beer! SARAH: Yes, Sheriff. What? Well, see, I have a bet going with Vincent. See, if I win, then he's going to make me breakfast in bed for a month. And if he wins, I wait tables. Neither. Stop wagering on my love life or lack thereof. All right, so who's this lucky person? It's a researcher who got canned today. He'll be over just as soon as he finishes off some paperwork, which could take a while. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Don't. Carter. It's Carl. Hey, Carl. You done already? No. Listen, I wanna thank you for the generous offer, but I don't think I'm going to be needing a place to sleep tonight. Carl, where are you? I'm just cleaning. Cleaning what? You're place is empty. The railing of the Da Vinci Bridge. Don't move. I'll be right there. SARAH, door! (SIREN WAILING) Hey, Carl. CARL: Hi. You wanna come back here? Why? My whole life's a failure. Blew up six years of research, got fired, ended up with nothing but my toothbrush, all before lunch. Okay. This was a setback. My work is my life. And without it, I'm nothing. No, you're something. You're... You're a nice guy. I irritate you. I irritate everybody, it's not surprising. I'm irritating. Well... You're colorful. Don't patronize me, Sheriff. All right. Well... If you're going, then... Hold on. What are you doing? No! No! Don't, don't. When I get nervous, I get very confused. If I get confused, I might... Fall? Yes. I'm glad you understand. Oh! (STUTTERING) I don't think you wanna do this. I get it. I mean, you've had a really rotten day, and everything sucks. Okay. Why don't we just climb back over and talk about it? Huh? You know, go grab a beer? Make fun of Stark? What do you say? I never grabbed a beer with anybody in my life. Today's the first drink of the rest of your life if you don't jump. You think we could be friends, huh? I think that's what the beer is for. What do I do? I don't know what to do. Take it real slow. I can't do it slow, I gotta... Okay. Okay. Gotta do it really fast. Give me your hand. Okay. Come on! (BOTH SCREAMING) (BEEPING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) CARTER: Carter. Carter, are you all right? (GROANING) Not sure. Still taking stock. How did you know? Well, your blood pressure spiked, your adrenals went into overdrive, and your white cell count suggests you may have broken something. Well, I fell down. A long way down. Are you sure you're okay? (GRUNTS) Where's Carl? What do you mean "Where's Carl?" I thought you were staying on top of him. Believe me, I was. Call you later. (MACHINE WHIRRING) Henry? Henry? HENRY: Carl? Listen, I heard the news, and... I have to talk to you. What happened to your head? What? Your head! Oh! Yeah, I took a bit of a tumble in more ways than one. Look, let me clean that up for you so it doesn't get infected. No, no, no. With those hands? I don't think so. Do you have a sink? Sure, in the back. There should be some sanitizing lotion and disinfectant in there, too. Oh, my God! Oh! Oh! (EXCLAIMING) FARGO: We have preliminary data on the lab accident. Looks like there was a momentary breach of the EMG that coincided with the accident in Dr. Carlson's lab. Pulse wave from the ultrafuge probably caused a magnetic disturbance. That's not all. We're detecting exotic atomic particles inside his lab that I've never seen before. And the breach appears to have come from below his lab in Section Five. Hey, Carter. You okay? Yeah, yeah. I think I might have cracked a rib or three. What? How? Funny you should ask. It's a good story. (GRUNTS) A hypothetical guy falls maybe 50 feet, lands flat on the ground. And then another guy weighing 180 falls and lands on top of him. Okay, what is the chance of the hypothetical guy getting up and walking away? Well, whether I use single case probability or an application of Bayesian statistics, the outcome is the same. Slim to none. Yeah, that's what I thought. Look, this hypothetical guy, is that you? No. I landed on the hypothetical guy, though. It was Carl Carlson. What? Carl was just here! I mean, he did look pretty beat up, but certainly didn't look like a guy who fell 50 feet. Doesn't make any sense. I gotta find him. You might want to find a doctor. Yeah, okay. (MUSIC PLAYING) Vincent. A beer. VINCENT: Okay. But you don't drink alcohol and I don't serve you any more since you brought in the health inspector. There was a fly in my soup. You sensed a fly in your soup! I may have overreacted. Hey, you overreact a lot, mate. That's why you're out. Number of animal distress calls I've made to your house? I'd have canned you years ago. Yes, Taggart, you're right. I used to be a man afraid of everything. But all that will change. Starting now. Beverly. Carl, oh, my God, what happened? Are you okay? I'm better than okay. I'm really sorry that I couldn't take your calls. Global revoked your therapy privileges. Totally understandable. Why would you take my calls? I was a loser. But I'm a new man now, Beverly. You told me to take risks and you were right. You're touching my skin without gloves! Without disinfectant. Fear kept me from living, Beverly. Kept me from trying the things at I wanted to try and doing the things I wanted to do. But something extraordinary happened to me today, and all that's changed. I wanted to say thank you. I've always wanted to do that. Who hasn't? Even I've thought about it. And now, Beverly, if you'll excuse me. Good night, boys. Well, well. Dr. Stark. CARL: Stark? Carlson. I would've thought you'd been redacted by now. Oh, I have been. You took away the only thing that I ever cared about. You're gonna regret it. You and I both know I should've done that a long time ago. CARTER: Carl! I've been looking everywhere for you. What happened? Carl! No! Carlson. No job is worth this. Then what do you think this is worth? HENRY: Spontaneous cellular regeneration. The implications are staggering. Surgeries, amputations, organ transplants, all could become a thing of the past. It could change the entire face of medicine. Think how much relief this will give everyone. Well, except for surgeons. Oh, and hospitals. And the guys who make Band-Aids. HENRY: An amazing transformation! A little too amazing. Carlson's not just a researcher anymore. He's the research. He's finally come through. I'd think you'd be happy. Look, I'll be the first one to jump up and down if he can replicate the results. But until then, he needs to be studied. Dr. Stark. I have some numbers for you to sign off on. Thank you. If you'll excuse me. I think we found the source of the exotic particles. There was an electro-magnetic breach in the floor above Section Five. Which room? I can't say. The room doesn't appear on any of the published schematics. It's classified, and I'm not, so, unless you wanna up my security clearance? Yeah, give it to me. Oh, that's not possible. There's 20 layers of concrete and charged-particle barricades surrounding the room. What's in there that's so dangerous? When I perfect this formula, I can make you invincible. That's a very generous offer, Carl, but I think I'm gonna have to pass. Really? Why? Think about it. You won't be afraid of death any more. I'm not sure if that's a good idea. Besides, fear's what keeps you sharp, right? You know, buy me a beer some time. Tickets to a ball game. Something. I've never been to a ball game. All that spilled food on the ground, fermenting in beer and filth always used to make my skin crawl when I used to think about it. Well, when you put it like that, it's no wonder. Well, it's interesting. It doesn't bother me any more. In a strange way, it's almost appealing. Ever since the accident, I have had this bizarre life craving. Sounds like you feel pregnant. (CHUCKLES) Well, in a strange way actually, I do. It's like a light's been turned on. It's like I've been reborn. Just came for the patch. Your exam is over. So I passed? Yes. You are officially insured by Global Dynamic's life and health. I still say it's tempting fate. Yeah, well, now you can go get your ribs checked out. You do at least have them wrapped? Oh, yeah, yeah. Of course. Do you have an ace bandage? No. Fresh out. SARAH: Yes you do, sheriff, in your gym bag. Upstairs. Bedroom closet. Okay, that's really disconcerting. Yeah, you get used to it. Traitor. Come on. (CARTER GROANS) ALLISON: Come on. CARTER: Okay. I'm worried about Carl. I think there's something going on with him. I mean, besides the invincibility thing. Well, he seems to think it's a good thing. Can't believe I'm saying this, but I think I'm gonna miss the old Carl. All right, now I'm gonna have to get your head checked, too. (CHUCKLES) I... He's not right. Well, Henry's running a full battery of tests, so hopefully they'll tell us what happened. Yeah. Okay, so how's that? That's better. Good. Well, maybe now you'll get some sleep. Yeah. Here. Come on, lay down. All right. (GROANS) Come on. Yeah, that's the one thing Fargo got right about this place is the mattress. (EXCLAIMS) It's a prototype for a body-contouring silicon. Really? Oh, my God! Yeah, I know. I need one of these. I think everybody needs one of these. All right, I'm getting up. Okay. (EXHALES) All right, I need to get outta here. (SIGHS) Okay. And now some regenerative gel. (SIGHS) It's not healing. I'm doing everything exactly the same way. I don't understand. (BLOWS AIR) (SIZZLING) My cells are regenerating, but what am I doing wrong? (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) SARAH: Good morning, Zoe. I win. (GROANS) Hey. Oh, I think I fell asleep. I think you might have. Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, I have to pick up Kevin from his friend's house. I had a purse. It's... SARAH: Your purse is downstairs, Miss Blake. All right, that's really disconcerting. You know what, put that on. Thanks. So... See you at Global. Yeah. Allison? Huh? Thanks for stopping by. Yeah. (GROANS) HENRY: I've reviewed all the test results, and it's absolutely amazing. I mean, you won't believe what's going on with Carl's blood work. Hey, good morning, guys. Morning. Morning. Weren't you wearing that yesterday? No. Just similar. No, don't look at me. I wear the same thing every day. I found traces of radiation in his white cells and his exotic particle count is off the charts. Is there any chance that the explosion could've caused that radiation to leak from an adjacent lab? Not that I'm aware of. Well, whatever Carl was exposed to, it's created a spontaneous genetic mutation that is accelerating rapidly. We just have to figure out what those mutations are doing to him. Whatever it takes, Henry. What am I doing wrong? (DOOR OPENS) Doctor Carlson, here are the biliary epithelial cells you requested. I asked for nonparenchymal progenitor cells! The lab tech said that Dr. Carlson attacked him telekinetically. I wouldn't discount it. Seriously? When I first looked at Carl's blood work, I thought the explosion had somehow reprogrammed his cells to spontaneously regenerate. It didn't? No. The cells aren't doing the work, his brain is. Here. Take a look at this. HENRY: Now, most people use maybe 10% of their brain at any one time. This mutation has allowed Carl to access all 100% of his brain. Okay, well, maybe I'm only accessing five percent of mine, but that would just make him smarter, right? Like, not invincible. HENRY: The mind has powers that are completely uncharted. Tibetan monks have been using meditation to promote healing for centuries. Maybe one day man will evolve to the point that he no longer needs doctors. He'll be able to heal himself with thought. But not for thousands of years. Tens of thousands even, if ever. Carl is already there. And he's still evolving. But into what? Hey, buddy. I guess you heard about the incident. Yeah. I don't understand what's happening. It appears that you were exposed to something during the explosion that's altered your brain functioning. That is why you're able to heal so quickly. So, my research is a failure. I didn't do this. CARTER: No. No, yeah, yeah, you did. Just with your mind. I guess that's why I can't get this out of my head. What is it? I don't know. I have no idea. It's like a song that you can't think of the name of. I'm starting to sense things. Feelings and thoughts. Do you know what this is? No. Dr. Carlson, I think it's time we went somewhere to run some more specific tests. Why? Determine what's happening to you. I think you want to study me. The way you want to study that. (DRUMS ON TABLE) Dr. Carlson. I think he's evolving a little faster than we thought. Beverly. Carl. You scared me. CARL: Something happened to me. It... It's happening to me. And it's something that I didn't create and I can't control it. It's okay. I feel connected to everything at the same time (STUTTERING) And I'm seeing images. I'm hearing thoughts. It's just remarkable. But it's a little scary. Come. I'm here. Whatever you need, Carl, I can help you. (VOICES MURMURING) You don't wanna help me. You want me to help you to get into Section Five. I wanna do what's best for you, Carl. I'm so stupid. I thought that you cared for me. I do care for you, Carl. You're a liar. Carl. WOMAN 1: I always knew he'd snap one day. (VOICES MURMURING) WOMAN 2: So much promise. MAN 1: A waste, a waste. VINCENT: I thought he was strange before. (PEOPLE GASP) Carl! Carl, slow down. Carl. I'm a friend, remember? I thought I'd created something incredible. I know. But it was something at Global. Some... Strange kind of radiation? How did you know? Because I was thinking it? Loud and clear. Okay, that's a little disturbing. So, then, you know that the only place that can help you is Global. I go back there, they'll never let me leave. Trust me. (CAR TIRES SCREECHING) MAN: Come on! Let's go! Carl, you've gotta trust me. I'll take it from here, Carter. We're doing just fine, thanks. Carter. Nathan. Okay, the two of you, just take a breath. Dr. Carlson... OFFICER: Move in! ...let me help you. Before it's too late. You don't wanna help me, you wanna use me. Why would I wanna do that? 'Cause you think I'm the key. The key to what? Nothing. To Section Five. To his precious artifact. What is he talking about? I have no idea. The sad thing is you really don't know what it is, do you? You're obsessed with this object you know absolutely nothing about. Do you? Carl, you can't leave. Wait! (PEOPLE EXCLAIM) Carter! Carter, damn it. He's not breathing. Call for help! ALLISON: We're losing him! I know what to do. Get him back to Global! Now! ALLISON: Please let me call in a trauma surgeon. It's not working! I have to get closer to it, the artifact. You can't. It's the only way. We have to go to Section Five. Now. Wait here. What? No! I'm coming with you. You're not authorized. Nathan, this is ridiculous! The man is dying! Allie. If we're gonna do this, we have to do it alone. Trust me. (ALARM BLARING) That's close enough. Set him down. CARL: Hey, welcome back, Sheriff. NATHAN: Come on, Carter. You okay? There you go, come on. Get him to the infirmary. MAN: Yes, sir. Carlson, wait! Don't do it, Carl. It's gonna be all right. It'll destroy you. I'm not afraid. Carl, please. I have to know. What is it? One day you will know. Question is, will you be ready? I am. ALLISON: You sure you want to do this? Absolutely. We've waited long enough. Because now I'm having second thoughts. This was your idea. Exactly, and I don't want you to blame me for talking you into it. Oh, hey, if there's one thing I've learned from Carl, it's to take some risks. Now, come on. Let's do it. Okay. Okay. Just sign and date here, and you will be 100% insured. Well, without Carl around, maybe I won't be needing it. Where'd he get reassigned anyway? I don't know. Nathan had it classified. Figures. I'm gonna miss him. All right, here goes nothing. What made you change your mind? Well, can't let fear run your life, right? No, we can't.
