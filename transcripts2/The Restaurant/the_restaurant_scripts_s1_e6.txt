 We have evidence against several restaurants. Djurgårdskällaren is one of them. We want to talk about the debt you owe to Ragnarsson. It must be paid. -Marry me. -I can not. -Should we give Peter Löwander a beating? -I want to try another thing first. Are you Suzanne? Maybe you can help us. You get interest, and we keep you as a supplier. - We can not be seen anymore. -You're cowardly! I can not lose Uno. -Do you still want to go to the movies? -It's done. I'm looking for a woman in stockholm Suzanne Goldstein. And who are you? Her husband.

 -A liquor spy can shut us down immediately. -Coffee with a splash of Grand Marnier. I withdraw the alcohol permit with immediate effect. Closed for the time being. Now the fish chef has resigned. You can hardly blame him. -How long will they sit there? -Let's hope they can come up with something! -Bye. Have a good one. -You too. Majken is leaving too? She's moving home to Örnsköldsvik. - Have you looked for a position elsewhere? -No. I haven't even told mom about this. -She'll find out eventually. -I know. By the way, she's curious about you. -About me? -Yes.

 - Have you talked about me? -Yeah. -What did you say then? -How much you bother me all day. But also that I miss your voice when I get home. Who'd have thought it? We have an idea we want to present. We don't want people to think we closed because the license was suspended. I can't see how that makes much difference. We can't let the restaurant bleed any longer. There must be a major change. Our idea is inspired by the French bistro. It's less formal, though with the best possible food and service. - "DK Club", what is this? -We have dance and music every night. That's what young Stockholm longs for. And, for the grand oopening, Alice Jo. -Alice Jo? -But Mom! Everyone is talking about Alice Jo! She has just toured in America. - Can we afford this? -Yes, if everyone helps. Agnes and her architect friends will help. But we need some cash. Can we mortgage the summer house? The alternative is that we are forced to sell. -I can talk to the bank. -Thanks. Brochure from the union. - I come from the union. -Is Miss a member? -No one is here. - Have you closed? -Only temporary. What happens if they do not reopen? Members of the union are eligible for unemployment benefits. It's staff meeting today. We'll see. For union members the union negotiates with the employer. -What's your name? -Margareta. Maggie. Ursula. Come by our room one evening. Good morning. Get rid of that! The union is an insult here. They're driving the cellar master crazy. All other restaurants are unionized. Djurgårdskällaren takes care of their employees, even in difficult times. Now the situation is special, and it also affects the Löwander family. The union supports the workers, they do not oppose the Löwander family. Get rid of that brochure! The meeting starts at nine o'clock. Be on time! We want to thank you for your patience. These have been some turbulent days. But you have stood firm through this uncertain period. Thanks for that. Now we have some good news. Djurgårdskällaren will reopen, but there will be changes. We will refurbish the place as well as change the menu. In future we need your help with chores other than your usual ones. Everything from painting to to creating new menus at the printer. -Yes? -How about the salary? We waiters earn the most from tips, especially for drinks. We can't pay anything extra, unfortunately. You get your regular salary, minus tips. If anyone wants to leave us, we understand. Together we will make Djurgårdskällaren into Stockholm's best restaurant. Combine French and Swedish? should I put liver pate on tournedos? -Backe will probably come up with something. -A little renewal is fun. The cold sideboard is a central part here, and it will continue to be so. The food should be simplified. Serve it as it is, without artistic expression. No radishes cut like roses, and so on. Okay? Present the menu at the end of the week. He should not come in a suit and teach me to cook. Our fish chef has left, and we don't have time to recruit anyone new. We'll put our effort into meat and cold dishes. Excuse me, chef? I thought that maybe I could help. -As a fish chef? -At Hasselbacken I assisted the fish chef. -Even here I have helped. -He is very good. - Can you do without him? -It'll be extra effort for the cold sideboard folks, but we'll make it work. You get the chance until we find a new fish chef. Calle and Holger, work up at least 4 menu suggestions and present them to me. -Understood? -Understood, chef. Holger, shall we plan together? You, one thing you should understand. You're here on loan, so don't make yourself at home. He's not worth it. -What happened? -You were just let into the hot kitchen! Now I have to do something amazing! -Do you want to help me? -Of course! I made a deal with Ragnarsson, so don't worry about the photos anymore. So I just need to worry about the restaurant. The most important thing for a cellar master is to keep the alcohol license. Your routines led to this. When I come out, you can return to your law studies. -What are they saying? When are you coming out? -The lawyer is negotiating with the prosecutor. -Is there anything else I should know? -We are making some changes. What? Nothing big. Some modernizations. We stand for tradition and quality. We'll just be a little more with the times. We'll talk about it when I get out. This is MY restaurant. -Alice, can we get an autograph? -Yes. Many thanks! -I want to talk to you about a club. -My manager handles bookings. -One minute, just. -You're very persistent, miss ...? Nina Löwander. I usually arrange jazz evenings at Djurgårdskällaren. Alice, I love you! -Many of my friends have played there. -We will reopen soon. -It should be a bit like Stork Club. - A great place! Many bands want to play at the grand opening... -but I want the opening night to be exceptional. I want someone who sets the bar. How does that sound? Interesting! I'll have my manager contact you. Here is the appeal. Here is an application for a new permit. You are well aware of the "Guidelines for Alcohol Licenses"? Recipients must be blameless, but your director is in prison. My brother has neither been charged nor convicted, merely detained. He does not deny involvement, so he will be convicted of something. No permit. Alice Jo has said yes! Brilliant. -What is it? - We didn't get it. What? Do we have to cancel everything? Never! We continue as usual. What should we serve people? Milk? Small beer? I'll solve it. We keep it to ourselves. We do not want to worry mom. I'll solve it. Here is the architect. We need all the help we can get, and here we have them! -You can continue upstairs. -Welcome. Can you help me with a meeting? -Who should I meet? -Erik Rehnskiöld. He's a wine agent. - But be careful, he likes young girls. - Wonderful ... -How old is the man, really? - Close to eighty. Looks like you've really started the transition. I couldn't have done it without you. -Are you staying here to work today? -Yes, I have to stay a while longer. Here. -What is it? -Against the fatigue. -Isn't it dangerous? -The doctor prescribes them to everyone. -See you tomorrow. -I'll look forward to that. Bye. Thanks. -"No"?! -The property is already fully mortgaged. By whom? And when would it have happened? The mortgage deed was registered in 1938 and signed by your late spouse. Impossible! The house has been owned by my family for over three generations! -Your husband made the decision. -So a new mortgage cannot happen! - I'm sorry, Mrs Löwander. - As I certainly am too! We've been on tour in the U.S. Now everyone wants her, so the price goes up. We are new. We have a tight budget. Alice likes you and wants to play here, but many people pull at her. -Okay, let's go ahead with it. -I need half the money now. I have no cash here. Can I come by later? Yeah, sure. -Mom, have you talked to the bank? -Yes, it's arranged. Good. I have to pay Alice in advance It turned out to be more than I thought. I don't have the money now. The accountant was ill. Someone else should be able to help you, right? - You will have the money tomorrow. - Good. I have to rush. I'm going to meet a journalist from Vecko-Journalen! Good! You have practiced? It shows. You are very good. One more time. Continue "Oui?" Who is it? Suzanne, it's Philippe. Philippe? It's not possible. Here will be the restaurant part. Simpler dishes... well, you get it. The dance area will be here. Djurgårdskällaren is in the middle of a large scandal. What do you think of that? I look to the future. DK Club is a good example of our future orientation. Isn't that a difficult task for a young woman?? It's probably not harder for me than for my brothers to run a business. Alice Jo will play at the opening. -Can I write it in the article? -Of course! Thanks. -Are you looking for someone? - Are you Nina Löwander? -Hello. Erik Rehnskiöld. -Yeah ... Hey. You thought you were going to meet my uncle, huh? Unfortunately, he is ill. I'm sorry to hear it ... -What are you doing here? -I'm organizing a club. Just what the city needs! And here you can drink good wine. In the restaurant, anyway. I'm just back from Bordeaux, with a load of fine wines. Come to my cellar and I'll bring out some bottles that appeal to passionate wine lovers. -What does it look like tonight? -It's not possible. It'll have to be another time. - It was a pleasure, Miss Löwander. - You can call me Nina. - What's going on? What are they doing? - We're refurnishing, Director.. No no no! Stop, everyone! Immediately, stop! What are you doing? Keep working, we must use every second! -Hello. -Hello... They're tearing down your and Dad's life's work! Don't be so dramatic! We just changed the furniture a bit. I'm still cellar master! You are our face to the outside world. We need you and your solid knowledge. But...? Peter and Nina must be allowed to implement their ideas. They have my full support. Should I be a fucking puppet? - Did you get the permit? -Soon. That permit is in MY name. Don't ever forget it. -Is there a problem with the condition? -No. Peter is so hypocritical. He's trying to take over the restaurant. He makes it sound like he's doing all for Djurgårdskällaren's best. -You're the cellar master. -Yes, it's a great title ... You probably have the staff with you. What do Roos and Backe say? I don't know, but they'll never go against Mom. You can get Helga on your side. Defend your position. In Mom's eyes, Peter is flawless. She has even accepted Suzanne! Speaking of which, I heard a strange thing. An acquaintance's son is a student of hers. When he was there for a lesson, a man came to visit her. Suzanne was apparently so upset that she fainted. It was apparently really upsetting. The boy doesn't want to go there again. Six people at eight o'clock. We will fix that. Welcome. Djurgårdskällaren, good evening! On the 24th we are unfortunately fully booked. What is this? Soup. -What kind of soup? -Bouillabaisse. -So Calle has started cooking French? -Yes, chef. -Has Calle ever been to Marseille? -Where? In Marseille, the hometown of bouillabaiss! No, chef. -Has Calle ever eaten bouillabaisse? -No, but I have read several recipes. I would have expected more - from both of you. You can go. You are wasting our time. Djurgården cellar does not get the permit. The application does not apply to Djurgårds- the cellar, without Restaurant DK. I'm in charge, and my name should not be a problem. - Do you have enough experience? -I grew up in the restaurant. - I'm surrounded by competent people. - I'll show it to my colleagues. -How long do you think it will take? -The next meeting is on Thursday. - But we open the following day. - Then you must postpone the opening. Should we have this kind of filth on the walls? What do you think Dad would say? I've seen much worse in Berlin in the 20s when your father and I were there. I think this party is a bit poorly drawn. Can he clarify the contours a bit? -Should we taste the new menu? -Not right now. -Where are you going? -I have a meeting. Your assignment requires discretion. Keep an eye on my brother's fiancée. -She plays the grand piano? -Yes. -Why? -Because I say so, that's why! Don't let her or my brother see you watching her. If you find something useful you get double that. So, off you go! Helga:Mmm! Peter:Good. Thanks to you and to the kitchen staff. Good work! The cold sideboard too. Many fine dishes. - The shrimp cocktail is wonderful. -Thanks so much. - The meat dishes were much as they were, good, not great. -Peter:But the steak stands out. I have a question with regard to fish dishes. What have you thought of them, Backe? We have a temporary fish chef. I can replace him. -No! The soup was incredibly good! -I agree with her. It was outstanding. One would wish that the meat dared be as innovative as the fish. -Can we meet the fish chef? -I'm going to get him. -It was really good. -This one was also amazing. Yes, here's the fish chef. -Miss. -Thank you, Inger. Look here, then! A whole center spread about you and DK! "The younger generation wants to bring American nightlife to Stockholm." Let's see. Next to the article about Alice Jo! Good! I don't understand her music, but she seems to have a certain appeal. You are welcome to use this. -You can finalize the deal with her manager. -Thanks Mom. I want to be connected to the Jewish congregation, thank you. You were said to be dead. I saw when they shot you. But I survived. Yes. I thought I had lost you. It was unbearable. Together we'll get through to an answer. We return to Paris and start again. Start again? I don't know what to say. I have just started over. With the man you're living with? What's he know about you and your life? Does he know who I am, & Sarah and Jerome? Suzanne, follow me home! No. I can't get used to it. I can't take it. But I'll help you. Please, don't go! I need you. I'm sorry, Philippe, really. But I can't bear it. So, here's the contract. It needs only to be signed. Here is the payment. -Are you sold out for that night? -Yes, with a waiting list. -Are you familiar with financial terms? -Yes? As "supply" and "demand" - -and how these two are related to each other? Absolutely. Your restaurant draws a full house thanks to Alice Jo. She should be compensated for that. We have agreed on a fee. There is a waiting list thanks to Alice. Demand has risen, supply is available. But what if the supply disappears? You can't change the price now. -I want double the fee. -But it's completely impossible. This is the price that applies. Then we have no more to say to each other. How can I get him? My restaurant opens tomorrow. I must know if I got the permit! Are you ready to try some good wine? I forgot! I have a lot to do. I understand. -Peter can probably try a little. - We'll do it another day. I mostly came here to see you again. -Me? -Do not look so surprised. -Can you sing? -Sadly, to the annoyance of those listening. I can't afford Alice Jo. People won't come when they know. People will come anyway, because they want to meet you. It was no accident that I came here. It will work out, Nina. Until then, how about some wine? -Should we both drink? -If you want! And Chateau Mouton Rothschild. It doesn't get any better than this. I need to go. Holger, the meat must be refrigerated before it goes bad. -Calle, help with the meat. -Of course, chef. I'm leaving. -Stop it! -It goes faster if we help each other. -I take care of my station myself. -The chef told me to help. Didn't you hear what I said? Sonja, are you ready? -So? -I saw something interesting today. She has barely left the apartment, but today she met someone. A man. They seemed to know each other well and held each other's hands. - Did you hear what they were talking about? -No, but she looked sad. Do I get my money now? Good work. Keep an eye on her. Hello Darling. Sorry I'm late - again. -I called, but you didn't answer. -I was out. What a fucking day! I've heard nothing about the liquor license yet. Fully booked with waiting list, and no license. It could be a fiasco. Sorry, I'm just talking about my own concerns. How are you? How was your day? Not so good. Listen. I have something I need to tell you. What is it? Aren't you feeling well? No. I think I've got something. I guess there was a child who infected me. -I probably can't play tomorrow. -It doesn't matter, as long as you rest and get better. You... Go to bed, I'll come later. -I love you. -I love you. Good night. Good morning! -Has something happened? -The meat has been out all night. Holger says you went with a girl instead of staying to help. Holger didn't want my help. It has to be Holger who forgot to put away the meat. -Why would I do that? -To get me sent back to the cold sideboard. Calle is here on a temporary visit. He's going back to the cold sideboard, among anchovies and herring. -Who decides here? -It's you, chef. - Do you trust my opinion? -Yes. -Have I put the wrong man in the wrong place? - I did not say that. Didn't you just say that Calle, whom I have placed by my stove, doesn't belong here? I did not mean... -Is there something wrong with my hearing? -No, chef. Miss! Is it true that you left with Calle last night? Yes. Calle tried to help Holger, but Holger sent Calle away. I can explain ... You are right. My judgment has failed. Pick up your salary, minus the meat that was destroyed. If you show your ugly face here again I'll dip you in the broth pot! We open in eight hours. Four or five dishes must be replaced. Any suggestions? We have seafood, a nice supply of shrimp. Surely we have a lot of potatoes and onions? -That's right. -Then I have an idea. Hey! Have you booked anyone else tonight? Otherwise I would love to play. Unfortunately, your manager demanded too much money. Former manager. He was fired. - Well done! - So, what do you say? Has he not come in? Where is he? Director Göransson is usually never be late. -Can I take a message? -He should call me! Damn! Hell, hell ... -How goes it? -Good, just fine. -It doesn't look that way. -It's just nerves. Everything's fine. Does Mom know you don't have a license? I understand you're bluffing. Gustaf! You look very satisfied. -Where is Peter? - He's coming soon. Oh, Peter! Do you have something you want to say? -Yes... -He has no liquor permit. Peter! This can not be true! Excuse me, Mr Löwander. -Inspector Göransson! -Mr Löwander. -Here is Nina. - Inspector Göransson. -It's a pleasure. - Have we received the permit? -Yes. -And no. -No? What do you mean? You get a permit, but the identity card you attached was expired. I need a current identity card. You can not serve alcohol tonight. -We will open soon! -Rules are rules. Please, make an exception! You know I'm Peter Löwander. I can not be sure. You have to present a current identity card. -Please! -I have done more than enough. I thought you might have one current identity card here. Good day. Inspector, this is Alice Jo. -She's going to perform here tonight. -I know, I'm a big fan. -I had planned to attend tonight. -Without a permit, we have to cancel. Miss Jo can't play for an empty room. # Nobody but you, everyone but me # # Loneliness is strange that way # # Saturdays, we're young, young and on the go # # Mondays, Saturdays are a fading show # Raw cakes ready! Two raw rakes! # I caught the signs somewhere between the lines # # He's constantly unsatisfied # # Loving him, I know he had a bunch # # He's not used to being beat to the punch # # Sure, I'm lonely, but it's clear I'd be lonelier # # beside him # # So he'll go do the town I will not be around # -Erik, you came. -Finally you get to meet the hostess. # He's free I'm done trying to please someone # What a night! -Alice Jo - how did you do that? -I know everything. -I know everything about wine, thanks to you. -I almost started to guess. Do you want to have dinner with me one evening? -Should I interpret it as a yes? -Yes. Miss Löwander! May I take a photo? of you and your fiancé? It's not my fiancé, but absolutely. # who's constantly unsatisfied # The cellar master is back! That was good news. Finally a familiar face! He is long awaited. It's a pleasure to see you again. The renovation is my brother's invention. Have you rebuilt? It's a shame that we have not got our usual table. You should get it back immediately. Variety pleases! We are happy with the table. Is it possibly the cellar master who has been behind the renovation? No. Hope the food tastes good ... -Sorry. -Idiot! Let Roos know how many glasses broke. There will be a deduction from the salary. He ran into me! There can be no deduction from my salary! It is not wise to argue in this case. Congratulations on your success. Everything you take on becomes a certain success. -I can't take all the credit. -Don't be modest. Thanks for tonight. We've made the change, and it was the time for it. The rest is hard work. - We miss Suzanne tonight. Where is she? -She is sick. Is she? Oh! Hope she's recovering. Is she resting alone, or is anyone there with her? Alone? Don't spend so much time at work that someone steals her from you. -Suzanne and I are very happy. -You are really lucky. Hello! -Hello Hello. -Maggan, hey! -Am I disturbing anything? -No, come in! You are so welcome! Corner, everyone! This is Maggan, who works at Djurgårdskällaren. We've tried to recruit someone from there for as long as I can remember. Hang on! -You can go home. -Thanks for today! -How did you get in? -The trick is to never go home. -The kitchen is closed. -I'm so hungry! I can make an exception for you. - Should I make you an omelette? -Tempting. -They are actually on the menu nowadays. -I heard that. Here. I asked them to deliver it directly from the printer. "Queen of the Night Nina Löwander has created a watering hole for partygoers. " "With an air of New York. Stockholm feels bigger thanks to her. " I knew you would succeed. Thanks, but this is what I meant. "The simple dishes shine brightest." "Taste the crispy raw raisins with roe, chopped onion and sour cream. " You must save your first review. -There you are! -Hello. -Erik Rehnskiöld. -Carl Svensson. -Nice to meet you. - Shall we go? -Yes. -Good night. -Good night.
