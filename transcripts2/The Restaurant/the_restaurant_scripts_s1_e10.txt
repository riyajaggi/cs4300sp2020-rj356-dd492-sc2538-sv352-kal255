 But is he completely crazy? I will challenge the agreement. I wasn't in my right mind when I signed it. -Why is he bringing it up right now? -Because I was against the restaurant in Klara. - I was against that too! - Don't you dare give in. With my share he owns 40%, like you. Of course you should get your share back! - You have to talk to him. - I most certainly will! But you, me, Gustaf and Nina must talk about the future of Djurg?rden. Just tell us when. Hello! I need a doctor! Sorry! Is that the girl? - What her name? - Christina. You'll soon be well again. You will rest in a nice bed. - Can you tell me what happened? - She climbed onto a table and fell. - How are you? - Well, I'm worried! - Can we contact the girl's father? - He's working, better not disturb him. Take little Christina to 5, I'll be there soon. First we're just going to examiner her. - Mom will be coming soon! - Come with me. - Attention! - Food in the door! The steaks are a little thin. You should make them 3 or 4 mm thicker. A little more. - What's up with that? - They're a little thin. They are perfect. At Cecil we do it like this. - Here we make them a little thicker. - Are you talking to yourself? No, I'm talking to him and you. You WILL call address me as Chef. I apologize, Chef. If you make them thick, they will cost us more. - Backe makes them thicker, Chef. - Backe isn't here. Now I am the Chef. Yes, Chef. You seem to have a lot of opinions on how this kitchen should be run. Maybe I should give you responsibility more in line with your scale. What do you say? You can cut potatoes, meat and sausages. And you can do it however you want. What do you say about that? Sure, with pleasure, Chef. Well! So we get the chicken out! Two baked goose livers. Enjoy your meal. - I applied for the presidency. - No, you're kidding! If I am chosen it will be something else. We will tell the working women in restaurants. You will win easily! - Have you started writing a speech? - Don't talk about it, please. I am terrified of speaking in public. You will have to get used to it President Nilsson. - Did they bother you anyway? - We need to talk. Follow me First let me explain that Christina was very difficult this morning. I dont want to listen. - How is she? - There is no danger. I've had a long conversation with the doctor ... about you. Me? Your abuse must be investigated. - What abuse? - Enough Nina! What does it take for you to wake up? Christina could have died! You have to understand that I looked away for only a few seconds. And ... she was very bored. You know how it gets. And I was alone. Windahl called the police and said they found Christina in a bush. And that you were passed out! I will stop drinking. I promise! And the drugs? That little case you keep in the bathroom? Are you so naive that You think I'm taking drugs. " No, that wasn't what I thought. I didn't want to think anything. I've been damn naive and it almost cost Christina his life. The doctor and I have decided that you should stay in the hospital. What do you mean? Erik! - It's the best. - You can't leave me here. Erik! Don't leave me!  Erik, don't leave me! don't leave Me. - Do you want black or brown? - Black, lined. - Do you want something from the PUB? - No. - How are you? - Good, but the chef is an idiot. Lennart. - Holger? - He's a bit heavy handed. - With whom? - With me. He wants to show that he's the boss. Everyone thinks you are better. Gustaf L?wander likes Holger. Holger is only temporary, right? Right. Splinter likes you, you know. Yeah but I feel like I'm ready for something more than this. You are only 25 & you're the best chef in Stockholm. You should be satisfied with that. I know. You're right. So we're going? See you. Goodbye. Hi. - How are you? - Fine, but I can't go home. It seems absurd! - What happened? - I fell asleep for a moment. And Christina climbed a chair, got onto a table and fell out the window. I know it's terrible, & I'm ashamed but it could have happened to anyone. - Mom said something about an addiction. - It's ridiculous! I ran a jazz club and tried several things, but I'm not an addict. No... Erik stuck his nose in my things, found something and associates it with the accident. But the two aren't connected at all. Gustaf, you have to help me. - What I can do? - Talk to the doctors, mom, I don't know! I need to get out of here! What happens if you leave here? They send me to Venngarn. (Institute of drug rehab) - I'll talk to the doctor. - Thank you. Don't worry. We'll solve this. But I also need your help. It's about the restaurant. "Honorable companions! Welcome to the annual meeting of ... " "We must evaluate the work that we have before us. " In front ... in front of us. - What is it about? - Maggan is running for president. Are they having difficulties finding someone? I'll look for topics that are important to women. Well! Cheer up! "Honorable companions! I feel proud and privileged ... ", no. - "I feel proud and privileged ..." - Keep going! - I'll never make it! - Yes! Don't be like that! It was a great start. Wasn't it? No. Yes it was. We've hear those phrases thousands of times. They're worse than sleeping pills. I liked it. But your voice is very monotonous. Food in the door! - Will this stay like this? - Yes, Chef. The chunks are too big. You have to do it again. - Do this shit again! - Yes, Chef. - You live in Sibirien, huh? - No longer. But your mother does, huh? Take this to her. She must not be very fat. Chef! I quit! Back to work! Let's go now! - Good evening. - Hello. You've already started? I thought the meeting was at 8pm. We were just chatting. Can you give us five minutes? You may be wondering what were we talking about before you arrived. Well we've been bad at listening to what you have to say. - I'm glad you admit it. - But we can improve. Obviously, we will move forward with the topic of separate showers and changing rooms. In return, we would like you not to apply for the position of president. It was too good to be true. We think only about what's best for the association. If you are chosen, which I strongly doubt ... You're afraid that I could be chosen. Otherwise you wouldn't offer me this trade off. If you were chosen, the entire board would be against you. There would be conflicts and fights. It would not benefit our members. Of course not, it wouldn't be nice. Then we will need other candidates for the board. Please, Margareta. Think carefully about what you do. Many women are tired of the Union's doing nothing for them. Your position only serves to increase your self esteem. The job as president is not paid. I'm not so sure. You go out often to eat and drink. Do you think you can do it? You are a single mother. You can do anything if you are angry enough. I think of your son since you don't. It's precisely about him that I think,. and about the world he will grow up in. A more equal world, I hope. But above all, I hope I'm not like you Should we start the meeting, or not? Hi. Hello! Are you home already? I've quit. - What? - I can't take it anymore. - We spoke yesterday. Did something else happen? - I don't want to talk about it. - don't worry. I'll find something else. - Not with the same salary. - Should I let Holger abuse me? - I didn't mean that. But we counted on that salary when we rented this apartment. I said I'll find something else! - Here, take this. - I just have to see Helga and Gustaf. The best dressed always has an advantage. What? What is it? Don't you want this? - Have you thrown clothes away? -Yes. You could have asked me. - Were they from Suzanne? -Yes. - Why did you keep them? - I didn't, it's just ... If I'm living here, I don't want things that remind me of your ex-girlfriend. No, you're right. So, now you're ready. As you remember, Peter had a breakdown while he was director. Because his wife eloped with someone else. I'm here, Gustaf. Talk to me. I took over the restaurant. Peter wanted to pursue law. We signed an agreement where I acquired his part of the restaurant. - That is a lie. - That's a lie? Didn't you want to dedicate yourself to the law? I never wanted to sell my share. I don't even remember signing it. It wasn't in me, and you know it very well. You were a little depressed but you could still read, right? Unbelieveable. How dare you, Gustaf? Suzanne had just left me. I had gotten drunk and taken sleeping pills. Ah, did you sign while you were sleeping? This agreement is not valid. Other lawyers don't agree with you. You should be ashamed. Without Peter, we would not have the Djurg?rdsk?llaren today. Oh my God! This is how you see it! No, this is how it is. I ran the restaurant during the war. Almost all of our colleagues went bankrupt. I made sure to keep it on top and thanks to me we came out intact. I went to prison for this restaurant, and when I came out Peter had taken it from me. What do you want to get out of this, Gustaf? Peter will have his share of the restaurant. Break that contract! - It's not you who decides! - Now calm down! Nothing I've ever done has been good enough for you. I've spent my whole life trying to satisfy you. It was futile. - This is getting nowhere. - No, you are very right. Not even my 20% helps you. You have 40% like mom, and the remaining vote decides it. So finally she will decide. No. What does "no" mean? I have a power of attorney from Nina. So I have 60% of the votes. - Has Nina given you a power of attorney? - Yes, last night. I'm the only one in the family who cares about her. We help each other. You really have no shame. No. It's one of the many defects that you usually point out to me, Mom. Attention! General! Good to see you up! What? Much more is needed to take down an old elephant like me! - Of course. There are no such men anymore. - Of course yes! don't worry! The Swedish Royal Army she has soldiers of the best temperament. It's a great pleasure to see you again. Let me escort you to your table. - Now we have to fight. - I've already lost, Peter. - Why? - When your father died I had a goal. It was to keep the family united. And instead we will finish in a courtroom. It's not your fault mom. You've done everything you could. Did I? In fact, did we? Good day, Nina. How are you? I am locked up. What you think? Can I help you with anything? Can you get me out Otherwise, you can go. - How is Christina? - Did you come to push me lower? I already feel a great guilt. - I'm here because I care about you. - And you're starting now? Nina, you are an adult. You put yourself in this situation. - Why did you give the power to Gustaf? - That's why you came. No, I came because I care about you. I have never been free to choose my life. You have chosen it all the time. I chose the life that you wanted, and it has made me incredibly unhappy. Nina! I told you clearly the options you had. You were scared. That was my idea, I admit it. You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, and you can't live without it. - You chose the silver spoon. - How can you be so tough? I've had to be to keep the family and the restaurant together. Maybe it made me a worse mother. Should have read you more fairy tales. Who knows, maybe Christina wouldn't have fallen out the window. You're right. I'm just a spoiled addict. Fix your life before it's too late. And nullify the power of attorney. I will never do it. Goodbye. Hi. Chef! Welcome! - Holger? - The director asked me to help. - I certainly couldn't turn it down. - Yes ... Glad to see you again! - Where is Svensson? Calle? - He quit. - What? Why? - Maybe he couldn't keep up. - What can I get you? - Good day! I can't find the fillet with onions. - Can it be done? - I'll ask in the kitchen. And for drink? I think I recognize you, miss. We have seen each other before? - Maybe you've been here before? - It's not the first time. - I'm a student, I couldn't afford it. - Then we will serve you well. - I had an exam today. I want to celebrate. - I hope you did well. Now I know! You were involved in that union conflict. - Are you still active in the Union? - I requested the presidency of my group. - Good luck! - Thanks, I'll need it. The worst part is that I have to give a speech. I am active within the student union, so I have given several speeches. I'll get you something to drink in the meantime Can you think of any advice to give me? - A beer, thanks. - Of course. I will give you some advice now. Talk about something that is very close to your heart. About your own experiences. Then the other will respond, naturally. Thank you. - That guy is good. - You'll starve him to death with all the talk. - Do you remember what his name was? - Palme, I think. Ulf, or Olof. - Hello! - Hello. - Hi dear. - Hello. - I feel much better now. - All right. The staff is wonderfully helpful. I am very happy to have the opportunity to get my life back on track. I'm glad you see it like this. - Do you know when I can go home? - Not yet. It will take time. Shall we sit? I was at the boat show in the Marmorhallarna. We could buy a boat when you're better, and go to the islands of the archipelago. That sounds wonderful. Doesn't it? Don't you want to go by boat? Come honey! Come! I want to go with dad. Daddy! - C'mon darling. Sit here. - Daddy... Nina, she's just not used to you. Nina ... Nina, wait! - Do you want to see Gustaf? - Yes, we need to clarify things. - Gustaf told me. - I understand. - We took care of you when you needed it. - I know, and I'm grateful. You really don't act as if you are. Hi. Sit down. I thought you would appear sooner or later. I knew mom wouldn't come, but she will surely send Peter, I thought. As a peacemaker, with some sort of compromise proposal. And you'd say that we're still brothers, and that family is the most important thing. - Am I right so far? - Mom didn't send me. Well then I'll answer ... that it can be good to have family, but it can be quite unreliable. Formal agreements are much better. Contracts binding by law. So, thanks for the interest, but things are fine as they are. Do you want a brandy before you go? You said that nothing you do has been good enough for mom. Yes. Yet always I thought you were her favorite. - You have the restaurant. - She had higher plans for you. I don't understand what you're saying. A director is like a cook with a more expensive suit. A lawyer, something else. - The restaurant is everything for mom. - No, you have not understood anything. Djurg?rdsk?llaren has been a means to mother. A way out of poverty. She was never interested in managing a restaurant, as dad & I were. One can show interest in different ways. Yes, really. You love being in the dining room with customers. Yes, is there any other way? For me there was something more, creating new experiences for customers. The food, the service, the decor. - It would seem that you wish to return. - I dont know. I'm considering Different alternatives. And is one of those alternatives managing the restaurant together? Well, I admit that ... We must both do what we do best. A commitment! What did I say? It worked like this when we reopened, and things were good. Why should I give you a part of the restaurant? I have the right to everything. To save this family, and in order not to destroy your relationships with mom and me. These relationships are already broken, and cannot be repaired. - You are so damn naive! - No, that's not true. You come here to talk about memories, and you think. everything will be fine I'm not like you. I don't believe in justice, and I'm not weak. - You have calculated everything in advance. - You're pretty predictable. You can have them. They're only copies. Where did you get them? Have you kept them hidden for five years? "My life is over," you said that time. It's still over, I think, if Astrid sees them. You are lowering your dignity. Dignity as in those photos? You would never take them to the police. Yes I would. And also to the press. This ... I never thought this of you. Do you still think I'm predictable? - What did you say to him? - I found the correct argument. Maybe it's better not to know. - The contract is broken. - That's good! I have a question. What would you think if i came back to be a director? - What does Gustaf say? - He thinks it's a good idea. AHA... - Are you going to leave the law? - It was probably never for me. Mom, this is Esther. - Good day. Helga L?wander. - Good day. Nice to meet you. - How beautifully you embroider. - Thank you! She is cute, your mom. And what a fantastic apartment. - Did you grow up there? -Yes. - What will happen to it now? - Will she continue living there? - I suppose. - Why wouldn't she? - It's great for a lonely old lady. She wouldn't want to be described as a lonely old lady. Didn't the whole family live there for many years? Your dad was director, and now you are director. - Maybe we'll start a family and begin the cycle over again. - There you go! I love you. I'm not going to make it long. You all have a lot to do. I have three things to tell you. First, Gustaf has decided to step aside. Second, I will take his place. And third, I missed this place, but above all I missed you. That's it. Thank you. - L?wander.  - Director, this is Roos.  - I heard you left the restaurant.  - That's true. - I don't like it at all. - Well, that's the way it's. For me there is only one director, and it's you. I thank you, Roos. But this is for the best, so stop calling me director. Good evening, Director. Come in. - Good evening, Mr. L?wander. - Calle. Thanks for coming. - I didn't know you had returned. - It's something recent. - But you quit, as far as I know. - Yes, exactly. The same day that various kitchen equipment disappeared. - Have you taken them to your house? - No, of course not. - Think about it. - I just took my knives. - These are very serious accusations. - Yes, but there are witnesses. - Who? Holger? - The acting sub-chef, yes. - You can't believe the shit he's saying. - The language, Svensson. I apologize, but it's a lie. Yes... He says you've taken a slicer. - How would you even get a cutting machine out? - We'll talk to him. Yes, here we have him. The new sub-chef of the Djurg?rdsk?llaren. What? Backe wanted me to call you. - Where's Holger? - Not here! And he will not return. I don't know what to say. - How about "thank you, Chef"? - Thank you, Chef. You know what it means to be a sub-chef, right? In 25 years, if I get sick again, you should be ready for the change. - I'll be ready, Chef. - I know, Calle. I'm tired. Take control tonight. - They understand? The sub-chef is responsible. - Yes! So... Let's get to work! Welcome back. Food in the door! A pike, table eleven, ten minutes! - Four baked cakes! - A little firmer. L?wander. Yes, it's me. Peter! We must go to Karolinska immediately. There has been an accident with Nina! I called Gustaf. He doesn't answer. We have reached item nine, election of the president. There are two candidates: myself and waitress Margareta Nilsson. We will introduce ourselves briefly. I have been president for six years. The experience and the network of contacts that I built has benefited our members. Margareta Nilsson? Do you want to introduce yourself? No? Shall we go to the vote? Group companions union 8. Eight years ago I came here to Stockholm from S?rmland to seek employment. I had left my ... I had left my son One with adoptive parents ... because I couldn't afford to provide for him. My work was hard, low paid and with unsafe working conditions. Much has happened since then both for me and for Sweden. Now I have a salary that allows me to support my son and myself. Our elders can live off of their retirement. Child support is essential help for many parents. Health insurance allows you to have stability when out of work. The labor movement, of which the Union is a vital part, has brought about these changes. We are proud, but we are not satisfied. I dream of abolishing social classes. And maybe it's at my workplace, in yours, or in our jobs ... that we can take the first step. That's why i aspire to be president. Thank you. Well ... shall we vote? Who votes for the undersigned to continue as president? Thank you. And who votes for Margareta Nilsson to be the new president? Margareta Nilsson will be the new president for the year 1951. I told you! Get up! Get up! She jumped from the third floor. Who survives such a thing? - Are you related to Nina Rehnski?ld? - Yes. Peter L?wander. The situation remains critical. She has serious fractures. The heart is stable but she shows no signs regaining consciousness. So is she still in a coma? How long can it last? Some wake up in 10 minutes. Others are in a coma for life. The longer time that goes by without signs of consciousness, the less the chances of waking up. - Will she survive? - I can't say. We have been here for hours and you can't say anything! I need to know if she will survive! It's a stressful situation, but I can't say anything for sure. Go home and try to sleep. This can take a long time. Of all things stupid what you've done. This was the dumbest yet. Today they made me sub-chef and you missed it. You would never have said that when we met in the kitchen 5 years ago ... and I made you an omelette. Things didn't turn out like we wanted. But they went well, overall. I met Sonja who is a wonderful person. Faithful, sweet and kind. And quite different from you. Bj?rn came, the most beautiful thing that happened to me. We are a beautiful little family. We are fine. We would like to buy a house in Enskede. And in summer we go on vacation to Denmark. And only ... none of it feels real. I always think about how It would be if we were together I fantasize about meeting you, and. your telling me you got divorced. I decide to leave Sonja. And finally we can be together. This is how it should be, actually. I know it's just a fantasy. But it gives me strength to continue. Then you can't die, Nina. Because then I would have no more hope. I will never stop loving you. I tried, but I can't. I will never leave you. Never. - Thanks for the pictures - I'm glad they were useful again. - For the future. - Salud, for the future.
