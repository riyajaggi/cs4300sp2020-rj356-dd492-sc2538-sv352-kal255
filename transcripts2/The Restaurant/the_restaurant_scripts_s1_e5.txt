 It is said that Miss Löwander have a secret lover. Have you got engaged ?! - Can I get one? - If you take me to the movies tonight. The credit limit has been exceeded, and the bank threatens to bankrupt us! -What a waste of time! -I have to ask you something. Where does the money come from? I would not touch you with forceps. It was he who jumped on me! - Do you take the word of a criminal? -Criminal? -Löwander. -Anders talked to you yesterday. Nina?

 She is with child. -Elin had a child and aborted it. - You can 't go there. -I want to withdraw my complaint. -We have enough evidence anyway. Starting tomorrow we have a new acting cellar master - you. -Hello. -Hello! Have you heard? The cellar master was taken by the police. You are joking! -What has he done? -Nobody knows. These are almost all bad! -Good morning, Ethel. -Hello. Do you know what happened? källarmästarn? There should be a meeting at ten o'clock. Then we will probably find out. I'm not paying for these! I have butterflies in my stomach.

 -Butterflies in the stomach? -I feel nervous. Then I understand. Butterflies in the stomach... It is good! I've never been a cellar master. -Nina, are you back? -Yes. -shouldn't you be in the archipelago? -It was so cold. I feel better here. You should attend the staff meeting. Must I? We'll all pitch in while Gustaf is gone. Is he still in custody? What is he accused of? We don't know. -You're coming, then? -I'm just going to change. You know the cellar master was arrested by police yesterday. It's a mistake which will soon be corrected. We support the cellar master in every way we can. During his absence, Peter takes over as acting cellar master. Staff already know Peter. He grew up in this kitchen. Everything will flow smoothly, as before. Peter. I am looking forward to this- -even though the circumstances could have been different. I'm confident that staff will manage this upset brilliantly. -Any questions? -Roos: When will the cellar master return? Nina! -Why didn't you say something? -I don't know. Miscarriage... -We have to let the doctor look at you. -Please, I can not bear it. The bleeding has stopped. - Another drop of blood and ... - Then we'll call the doctor. I just want to rest. - Can I bring you something? -No thanks, I'm fine. OK, then. -Gustaf! -Astrid, there's no danger. -This feels like a nightmare. -I'm coming home soon. -Today? -I don't know. I have admitted that I have arranged coupons for some guests. -How are Arvid and Hilma? -They wonder why you don't come home. Tell them I'll see them soon. How is the restaurant? Will Peter be permanent cellar master? I don't know. General Drugge. - Generalskan. Follow me. -Who are you? -Peter Löwander, the cellar master's brother. -We've heard the cellar master's been arrested? -He will be back soon. -Can he have visitors in prison? -He'll be back here very soon. You have a longer face than your brother. It indicates good character! They suggest that it is a rationing offense in question. Did he sell coupons? I thought so. There have been rumors about Ragnarsson for a long time. You were happy that Gustaf was able to keep the food supplies coming. This is something completely different. I don't think he'll be back tomorrow. -Carl, you're needed in the party room! -I'll be back in a minute. -Hello! How are you? -Much better. -You look a little pale. -It was freezing cold in the archipelago house. -I'm still freezing. -Let me warm you. -You have to take care of yourself. -I will. I want to talk to you about one thing. -When can we meet? -You're the busy one. Tell me when you can. -Tomorrow afternoon, in the park? -Perfect. -Miss Nilsson, what a coincidence! -Really! You almost seem to be hitting on me. -Thanks. Good evening. -Good evening. I could be your little wife. Do you want that? Yes. I can move in here. That would not be so strange. Two poor waitresses who want to save on rent. No, that's true. You, me and Uno. We would be a nice little family. It surely would be. -It went well tonight. -There weren't very many people. -At least you didn't seem to scare any away. -That's good to hear. -I knew you would be the one to stand here. -Yes, ever since mom told you this morning. I've known that since you were little. -Mr Löwander. Can we talk to you? -Yes. -I withdrew the complaint against Ragnarsson. -You did the right thing. So, I want the negatives to the photographs. I'm sure you do. You still can't use them, or you end up in jail for extortion. We see them as insurance. But that's not why we're here. We want to talk about debt. -What debt? -The restaurant's debt to Ragnarsson. -It must be paid. -I don't know anything about it. -Gustaf took out a loan. -Talk to him. You run the restaurant now, so we talk to you. Then come up with a payback schelule with a reasonable interest rate. -You'll not get out of this.. -But I don't know of any debt. Ragnarsson will have SEK 76,500 no later than Thursday. Was that all you wanted to talk about? Think about it, so that you don't do anything you may regret. Can you find your own way out? See you again soon. -Peter Löwander doesn't want to pay. -Damned bastard. He's being stubborn. Shall we beat him up a bit? We'll wait with that. I want to try another thing first. -What? -He has a weak point. I now know what it costs to repair the sewing machine. It's not cheap. -No. -I'll  have to buy a new one. I know which one I want. So give me the money, I'll buy it myself. -Calle, are you listening? -We have to wait a bit with that. -Why? -I don't have the money right now. We talked about this last week. You said there was money reserved for it. I bought a ring. I'm going to ask Nina to marry me. Well. This is very important for me. It's about my life. -You never think of me and Lennart. -I haven't thought much else in years! Can't you recognize how important this ring is to my future? You might as well throw the money in the lake. I can 't listen to you anymore. I need for you to document the terms of the debt you owe Ragnarsson. Write down three figures: How much you have borrowed, the interest rate and how much to deduct for the coupons. Damn! Has he been on you now? When are you coming out of police custody? I'm in jail all the time. I say nothing about Ragnarsson. -What was the third? -What to deduct? -How is the new job? -It's good. - Do you like it? - You ask if I enjoy it? I'm just trying to make it work. You... -When I come out I take over. -It's done. Okay. Good. I took the job because mom asked me. What are you trying to say? I don't know. I didn't mean anything. It's my mind. I haven't slept in a while. I imagine things. -You have nothing to worry about. -I know that. I'm holding the fort until you get out. Thanks. Good day. Yesterday we forgot Mr. Fransson, but we were still good. -Bye, Sweetie. -Bye! Yes. See you tonight, then. -Holger takes over today. -Are you looking for a job elsewhere? It might happen. I'm going to visit an old colleague, Martin Reimers. -Is he not in Copenhagen? -Yes. He's visiting here. - Are you buddies? - Didn't you know we were? We started at the same time as kitchen boys 1904. -It's going to be a great reunion. -I've taught him everything I can. -Okay, guys. Hold the fort! -Yes, chef! Andersson was weird when I left Uno. She said nothing, and seemed angry. -Can she have heard us? - Don't be ridiculous. There was something wrong with her. What if she knows. -Quiet! - What if she saw you this morning? -She keeps track of everything! -You don't know why she was angry! I may lose custody of Uno. Hi. -Hello. How handsome you are today. -Thanks. What was it you wanted to talk about? I love you so awful much. I want to be with you always. So therefore I wonder ... ... if you want to be my wife. Oy. "Oy" was not what I was hoping for. I don't know what to say. You don't have to answer right away. -I love you so much. -But...? Right now may not be the right time for this. I thought it was a good time. -How do you mean? -You're pregnant, aren't you? -I was. -No longer? - Was that why you asked me to marry you? -No! -I don't understand. Aren't you pregnant? -I had a miscarriage. Oh. It makes no difference. I want to marry you. I can not. I thought we loved each other. Helga: Nina! Oh, Nina ... what is it? -What happened? -I can not say. Beloved child! Easy. Calm, child. Easy. -How are you today? -Good. You're not bragging. You're not sick, are you? No. That thing about inviting me to the cinema, was that also just bragging? -Are you a man of your word? -Stop! There are too few guests and too many staff. We're losing money. -Things will come around. -I doubt it. -Other places are doing well. -Do a French bistro instead! -A neighborhood pub? -A nice bistro. It's so formal at Djurgårdskällaren. Everything is so rigid. In France, people go out to hang out. It's a different mood. -Maxim's was quite classy. -Not like here. No one in Paris would eat at your restaurant. Thank, Honey... I understand what you mean. You may be right. We should do something about the mood. I can play the piano. You have a piano at the restaurant, which no one plays. That would be good advertising for me. I want private students. - Would you like to go back there? - I'm tired of being home. -I have to do something. -Okay. Then we'll do that. -Hello. -Hey, Sweetie! Are you awake yet? -No whining or mess? -No. -I want to talk a little with you. -Certainly. -Your friend Margareta comes from the country, doesn't she? -Yes. You can tell by the way she speaks. The city can be a dangerous place if you are not on your guard. Yes...? So many unnatural things happen that you can't even imagine. It's easy to be fooled. I think that's what happened to you. Her kind should be locked up. - Do you intend to tell anyone this? - No, silly. It is between you and me. Thanks. But you must be on your guard in the future. Think of Uno. -No child should have to see that. -No. I promise. -Good night then. -Good night. Attention! Holger, Holger, my dear friend. - What delight are you making? - A gamey meat broth. A game broth? Then we'll see if it goes wild. It is very hot. Satan! I burned myself. Why do you say nothing? Ethel! Ethel, Ethel, Ethel! Give me a hug! -How is the chef? -Prima! I came to see that everything is fine. It is. So now, the Chef can go home. Reimers passed out an hour ago. He has become so feeble in Copenhagen. He has become an "old Dane"! The chef can go home now. Don't tell me, the Chef, what to do! It's a piece of advice offered in all good faith. What are you doing here? Get yourself into the cold sideboard! Shoo! Work, damn it! Hurry up! -Hope no one in the kitchen saw you! -It's already too late. -You're so fucking beautiful, still. -Stig!... -You have such nice breasts. -Calm down, now. Firm and fine, like little deer roasts. Behave, otherwise you'll have to go home. I sometimes think of when we were young. What fun we had. That was then. -I think about when we were young. -You just said that. -Why did we not escape? -God forbid! -We might have been very happy. -We were guaranteed to be unhappy. It was good as it was. -You have nothing lardy at home? -Lardy?! Forgive a simple question. - Well, I don't have lard! - Then I'll settle for butter. Sometimes I think on what one has done of life. Almost 50 years in a restaurant kitchen. I could have started a family. Now, who will take care of me when I get old? Will my kids take care of me? They can't even take care of themselves. I sometimes think of when we were young. Hi. Hi. I thought you were home now. I love you. You have to believe that. You can probably mean different things by that. What do you mean then? If you love someone, that person is more important than anything else. Even if you love someone, you can have other things you think are important. I want to open a jazz club, to travel and to be young for a while. I asked you to marry me, not to change your whole life. It's the same thing. Don't you understand? No, I do not. We're getting married, I'm having children, I get to take care of the home. Everything I think is fun I have to quit. You don't have to. It doesn't have to be that way. -Will YOU take care of the child? -We can wait to have children. It's a new time now. In some ways, yes. But not in other ways. If you love each other, you can do anything. Where are we going to live, then? Here? What shall we live off? Your salary from the cold sideboard? -Mom was right. -About what? I'm not good enough for you. "Holger" "No, Ethel! Come to my arms!" "What are you doing here? Go away!" -Good morning! Is everything under control? -Yes, chef. Good. May I pass through the hot kitchen, or should I stay in the cold sideboard? It's fine. Thank you most humbly ... -Have you talked to Andersson? -Yes. -What did she say? -She... We talked for a while. - Will she do anything? -No. -That's good! -Yes. Hi. -Miss! Are you Suzanne? -Yes. Can we talk to you? We have a problem you can help us with. Your husband has a debt to Ragnarsson. We've talked to him, but he doesn't want to listen. You can probably help us. -He has to pay. -I have nothing to do with that. -What are you in such a hurry for? -Let me go, please! -Where are you from? -France. France... See you soon, Suzanne. What is this?! Källarmästarn? YooHoo, cellar master! Yes? -This is ordinary coffee. -Yes? -I ordered an "extra" coffee. -Refill included. That means coffee with a splash of Grand Marnier. At least four centilitres. Unfortunately, we can't serve more than the legal ration. -So rude! -We're required to follow the rules. Are you going to spit in a regular customer's face? -Mrs Drugge ... - "The General's wife"! You have a telephone call in the office. -Is everything to your satisfaction? -No! Luckily my husband didn't see this. We don't serve alcohol in that way- -but we are happy to offer dessert. It would be desirable if the regulars got the treatment they're used to. -That's the law. They're watching us. -We have routines for this. -It was handled extremely discreetly. -It will be as I say. - Do I really have a phone call? -Yes. Peter Löwander. Hello Darling! What? Wait... If you come near her again I'm breaking your face! And I want to talk to Ragnarsson. Regulars are dissatisfied with the treatment they're getting. I can understanding why that's the case. -What does Roos mean? -They expect extra rations. That's the point of being a regular. -You must be able to thumb your nose at the rules. -It's too risky. We need our regular customers. We'll probably get no new ones after all that's been written about us. A liquor spy shut us down for the slightest mistake. Liquor spies have been around for a long time. But they've never been able to pin anything on us. -Roos knows who they are, don't you? -Yes. Hermansson, Klarberg - it's been a long time since I saw ... -They recruit new agents, don't they? -We foremen have a nose for this sort of thing. Peter. You can trust Roos in this. No. We do not thumb our noses at the rules while I'm cellar master. You've been in the job for two days, and you're already crazy for power. Fire me, then. We do as Peter says. Anyway, Mom, you know that this is secondary. We can't pull the restaurant with only existing customers. We need a new ones. Quickly. -What are you doing? -Stand over there! Calle, can I talk to you? You and Sonja must get along. You have brought your bad mood here. I can not stand two thunderclouds. I apologize. -Is it about the girl you made pregnant? -She's not pregnant anymore. You promised to take Sonja to the cinema. Now do it! Do you think she wants to go to the movies with me? Ask her! The atmosphere must improve. Come on! I just want to talk to you. - What's going on? Just say it. - We'll talk about it later. Tell me what it is! We can not be seen anymore. -I knew it. -I can not take care of Uno myself. You're cowardly! -What are you afraid of? -I can not lose Uno! -You made a greeting yesterday? - Never touch Suzanne again. Of course you will pay, with interest. But I must admit that you have more ballss than I thought. - I want to talk about the debt. - You have to pay it immediately. Now. You're an asshole and a gangster -but in the first place you are a businessman. You want to make money. We will soon go bankrupt. Then you'll never get a penny. The money will arrive anyway. This is my suggestion. You set a reasonable interest rate on the loan, and we make monthly payments until the loan is paid off. -and we keep you as a supplier. You have a company left when this is over. A way out of the gutter. Otherwise, I'll tell the police about the usury and the threats. They'll give you a couple more years. What do you say, Ragnarsson? You can say "Curt". -Are you nervous? -I have butterflies in my stomach. -How good she is. -Indeed? It turned out great with the music. Admit at least that guests appreciate it. Well ... let's just say it doesn't bother me. I've been a little difficult lately. I'm sorry for that. You haven't been the only one. -Did anything special happen? -No, nothing worth talking about. We can be a little more pleasant, otherwise Ethel will fire us. Do you still want to go to the movies? Yes of course. -What do you want to see? - "Enchanted", Hitchcock's latest! Okay! I love Hitchcock. Have you seen "Rebecca"? We're glad the butler is here. -Is there any hope of good service? -We always do our utmost. Want some dessert tonight? August. -August! -Snow eggs and calvados [cider brandy]. Feel free to have another coffee, if the butler understands. -I have to follow the rules. -Not you too! -It's not up to me. -Yes! And who would gossip? I? August? No one will guess anything! You really want to. A man with your unfailing sense of service! Your conscience does not allow you to treat regulars badly. -I'll see what I can do. -You are a true hero! Thanks for tonight. You've been a hit. I have my first student. A couple wanted a teacher for their son. You wrapped them around your finger! Tonight was a good night. -Are you Peter Löwander, cellar master? -Yes. May I talk to you? I'm from the Royal Control Unit. The cup contains coffee and alcohol. In addition, it was served after 22.30 to an obviously drunk person. I withdraw the alcohol permit with immediate effect. You will receive it in writing tomorrow morning. What should I say? I'm shocked. They sent a woman. It's so low. It is in absence of all human decency. -Temporarily or until further notice? -Temporarily. Peter intends to appeal. -When are you getting out? We need you! -That is nice to hear. -Why do you say that? -Peter thrives as cellar master. Do not be silly. It's decided that you should be cellar master. -if there is any restaurant left. Closed for the time being Mr. Löwander, I beg to resign. It's my fault we're in this situation. I'm leaving my post. Escape, you mean. You run away with your tail between your legs. Stay, and help to get Djurgårdskällaren on its feet. The staff should come here as usual.
