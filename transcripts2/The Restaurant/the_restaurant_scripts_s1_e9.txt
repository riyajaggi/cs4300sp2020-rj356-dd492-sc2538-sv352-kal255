 Not good. - Hurry, Lelle, we must go. - Stop calling me Lelle, it's ridiculous. Don't waste this opportunity. Apply to work in the kitchen of the DK. No! Lelle, can I see you? It's stained, go and change your shirt. Stop calling me Lelle! - He's angry all the time. - He's a teenager. When I was thirteen I was working full time as a dishwasher. I'm jealous. I miss Ethel and the girls from the buffet. They could use you; we're fully booked until Christmas. - I can't find any. - Come on, come with me. - Now he's ready. - So, let's go. - Goodbye.

We were just kidding a bit. - Damn bitch. - What did you say? Just stay on your side, okay? If that happens again, come and tell me. - No, stay five minutes. - I can't, I'm sorry. I have to go back to the office. - Can I use your shower? - Yes. Lock the door when you leave. - Generala, nice to see you. - Thank you. It's a pleasure, Director. I'm out on leave. The general is ill. I have been by his side night and day. Sorry. I hope he recovers soon. Soon pneumonia will take him away. Sorry. The general is a good man. He loves you, Director. And me too, of course. I have my whole life ahead of me. This may be the start of something new! - The suitors will line up! - You will always have priority. - I hope the food is to your liking. - As usual. And i know what I want for dessert. - Have you reviewed the Berglund agreement? -Yes. At the bottom of the sheet. Good. Send it to Berglund. - You're working hard here, I see. - Good evening, Mrs Sw?rd. Are we going? We have a table at seven. Sorry, I lost track of time. Peter, any plans for the weekend? My brother wants to talk about the restaurant. Let's finish this up now. Then we'll have the weekend free. I'll help you. - Should they be rewritten? - Thanks sweetie. - It won't exhaust you, will it? - No. -My husband likes to work around the clock. -I don't mind working a lot. Don't forget to relax sometimes. If he doesn't come in three minutes, I'm going. - Should you work this weekend? - There is a lot to do in the office. - How are you going to meet someone? - Mom, stop. It's been 4 years since Suzanne left. Time to move on. - What if I already met someone? - Oh yeah? - Good day. - It's about time. - Do you need to punch a time card? And Nina? Have you seen her lately? - What did you want? - As you know, the restaurant is booming. Time to use the surplus to expand. "Voila!" -And where is this? -Here, on Drottninggatan. Really? In the Klara neighborhood? It's a prime location, right next, to Hotel De Suede and Hotel Regina The current catering industry there can no longer handle all those journalists. - What is it? - Does the term "Normalm District Renovation" mean anything to you? Of course, I am not stupid. Well then you know that the Suede Hotel & the whole neighborhood will be demolished. Europe destroyed by bombs and We destroy our city ourselves. They didn't decide to demolish this area. Not yet, but it will come. They can't move all the newspaper offices. Journalists won't stand for that. The City of Stockholm is expropriating everything throughout lower Norrmalm. I say no to this location. - I don't need your approval. - Yes, the restaurant is mine too. - Mother? - I like Drottninggatan. - But I'm not sure, Gustaf. - We get it at a good price. Would you like to run a restaurant next to a construction site? Are you interested in coming back to the restaurant business? Absolutely not. Well now I have to go. The law is waiting for me. - Shouldn't you be at school? - Yeah, you know ... lately it's hard. My friends here are more important than study. Especially difficult for Sonja. A few weeks here with Stickan and he'll long for school again. I hope so! Why are you cutting carrots when onions aren't finished? Should others do it? - No, Chef. I'll do it immediately. - Don't expect favors here! No no no no no! Did you cut yourself? Sharpen the knives! They don't cut anything! - Shall I tell Ethel to look at the wound? - Show your brother how to do it! - Sorry. - I'll lend you one of my knives. Then i will show you how to sharpen it. Where does he think you are when you're here? Playing bridge with friends. - Bridge? You? - Well, I have to fill the days. Henrik never has time for me, only for work. You should be happy that business is going well. Yes, I'm happy. If not so, we wouldn't have time to see each other. What would you like to do if you were free to decide without constraints? Study economics. - And why don't you do it? - Because Henrik wants a housewife. - Isn't that what all men want? - I dont know. Why aren't you married? There're a lot women who would like to be your wife. I was engaged once. And? We'll talk about it another time. - Cake with cream? - The cream ran out at the store. People have missed it since the start of the war. - Where are you going? - To the club. French customers. - You've been away all week. - We'll talk business. You would be bored. Another time. - Invite some girlfriends over! - Certainly. Chef, how are you? Chef! Hey! Ethel, come! He's burning up! Call an ambulance right away! - It's not your fault. - He's like that, he didn't want any help. Stubborn as a mule. We can't just stand here. Listen! Get back to work! Think if a few years ago we had known that we would be sitting here. At home on a Saturday instead of being at the DK! Why don't we go there tonight, go out like old times? Erik doesn't want her to go out alone. - Charlie Parker will play at DK Club. - Charlie Parker? It is true? Sture tried to reserve a table. The place was fully booked. - If you ask, we'll get a table. - I don't know. It's a great time for you to go there! Charlie "Bird" Parker playing is a really big deal. Please! - I'll try, but I don't promise anything. - Health! I would like to talk about the environment being unsafe for women at work. - It's unsafe for everyone. - Yes I know. But women are more vulnerable. Changing rooms are almost always common. - That is a big problem. - Not for me. The problem is that people come to spy while the women change. Then you go out to the dining room and customers give you a spanking. It's not funny. Take it as a compliment! You have an ass worth spanking! Sorry, but this isn't a discussion we can bring to the commission. But we can talk about the changing rooms, right? We'll come back to that later. Next point. They always have more important problems. Damned idiots! It's good that you're angry. Anger moves things. I don't know if I can go on. They don't listen to me. I could stay home with Uno. - Talk to the woman who recruited you. - Ursula. - She will be on your side. - She has changed to a different union group. - Conditions are worse still in the breweries. - I dont know anything about that. Viveka, my friend, works in a Brewery in Gamla Stan and it's okay. Previously, she was at the Anglais, and that was hell. - How so? - The foreman took liberties. If she kept quiet, she got more tables. If she complained, he left her without tables. - You're joking! - It's true. And what about the union? She spoke to her representative. Do you think he did anything? No. Then she and three other girls were fired. We need you, Maggan. Don't give up. He has suffered a septic shock. Blood poisoning. - How is it going? - His condition is critical. Renew this as soon as possible. Must be delivered to Haglund before five. - What do we have here? - DK documents. - Are you interested in the restaurant? - No. My brother wants to invest. And I don't want to waste money. Drottninggatan? It seems crazy to me. Ask Jansson at the real estate office for information on the location. - We have a meeting tomorrow. - All right! Do you have time for lunch? You have been with us for two years. Yes, if you count the internship too. I have had many employees, but never anyone of your caliber. Thank you. That we have so many clients is in part thanks to you. I would like to ask you: Are you interested in being my partner? - Sorry? - "Sw?rd and L?wander Law Firm." Are you serious? The biggest firms will pursue you I know. But here you are building something. Of course I want it! Thank you for your trust. - Then let's celebrate! - Of course. - Roos! - Mr. L?wander, Lawyer Sw?rd. - A bottle of Cristal. - Of course. - Congratulations on such a successful business decision. - Maybe the best thing I've ever done. - Health! - Health. - What do you think of Ester? - Mrs. Sw?rd? - What do you mean? - You've known her for a while. Is she not changed? That she seems absent? I don't know. Before she shone when I got home. Now she seems indifferent. - You work a lot, Henrik. - I knew when we got married that my work might come between us. I think she has a lover. - What makes you think that? - It's just a feeling I have. I don't know what to say. I'm sorry. I didn't want to involve you, but I don't know who to talk to. It's probably just my imagination. She probably just wants to come before work sometimes. You are probably right. - Want one? - A whiskey. - You look so beautiful. - Thank you. Five married women going out at night. What will people think? Nobody cares about that at DK. Isn't it better if I go too? Honey, are you a little jealous? We will manage. Now I have to hurry. - Yes, but be careful. - Of course. I'm serious. God! Not so rough with the doors. Be careful with my car! - Good to have you here! - Thank you! Here! - Is this table okay? -Yes. 2. 3. 4 00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,880 That's where the staff hangs when they are going to serve. - What do you say about this one? - Thank you! It will be perfect! - Incredible that they brought in Charlie Parker! - We met when I lived in New York. - Did you just call him and ask him? - Yeah, I knew he was coming to Sweden on tour. - Champagne? - Yes thanks! - What do you think of her? - She's a bit too accommodating? - Berit? -Yes. No. I don't know. Go for it! It's already full! Two steaks and a plaice, table ten! Two steaks and a plaice! - We had another one, huh? - One more? - Lilly, another bottle of champagne. - Of course. - Does Calle work tonight? -Yes. Tell him the food was excellent. You better ask him to come here so I can say hello. - Just tell him the food was amazing. - No, tell him to come here. - Is that really necessary? - Stop! - Do you remember how we used to joke with Calle? - I also remember other things. Tortillas ready! Calle, they request you in DK Club. - Something happened? - A group wants to compliment the food. - I can't go now. - It's Mrs. Rehnski?ld. Nina. No! Yes! But where is Calle? He can't get out of the kitchen but he sends you greetings. - Are you still afraid of Backe? - Backe is sick. Calle is the chef. Calle is the chef? - I'll take that. - Let go! Ladies and Gentlemen! I'm proud and deeply honored to present ... the only one, Charlie Parker! Hey, I'm going to the bathroom. How much cooking time left for the meat and potatoes? Clear the doorway, food coming through! Two herrings! Four steaks! The herrings come out! Nina, wait. I thought I would thank you for the food. But I see that you are very busy. It's hard to get away right now. - So, have you become a chef? - Temporarily. I don't want to bother you. Go back. They can do without me for a few minutes. Thank you. - You seem to doing well. - I'm fine. Great actually. I saw you in the magazine. Nice house! - Where is it? - Djursholm. It's beautiful out there, with lots of nature and the sea. We are fine. - And how is ...? - Sonja. Doing well. She's at home, with our son Bj?rn. - Do you still live in Sibirien? - No, we've moved. We got a new apartment in Gubb?ngen, near a metro stop. Practical! - I've started driving a car. - Seriously? It's great to be able to drive alone. I got the permit last spring. - Calle? - Yes I'm coming. - I have to go in. -Yes. My friends will wonder where I am. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Good night, Ethel. - Good evening. Nina. - What are you doing? - Opening the door. - You're not thinking of driving? -Yes. - No, you will not. You are drunk. - No! Look, I can walk straight. - Give me the keys. - No. - Nina! - I need the car tomorrow. - We'll call a taxi. - I need the car! Okay, move over. I'll take you home. - Where is she? - In the car. We couldn't let her drive. - Come here. Time to go to bed. - Let me! - Lower your voice. - Mrs. Rehnski?ld is home now! Excuse me? - What is he doing here? - I don't want to talk to you. Was it a coincidence that Calle just drove you home? - Nothing happened, if you think that. - I don't know what to believe. - You drank a lot. Go to bed. - You don't decide for me. - Stop acting like a child! - I do what I want! It's enough. You worry more for the bottles than for the two of us! What "two of us"? Stop! No! Leave that! I hate you! And I hate being a prisoner in this damn house! I can't take this anymore. We'll talk about that tomorrow. Excuse me, where is Stig ...? Mr. Backe! Where is he? He was there yesterday! Calm down, Mrs. L?wander. He has stabilized and we moved him to a normal room. - So, is he out of the woods? - We think so. The fever has subsided and the blood labs are better. Thank you very much. Thank you. Sorry. I drank a little too much last night. - It's not the first time. - I know. But I won't drink again. - Really? - Really, for you and for Christina. - And for your sake. - Yes, that too. I love you and I don't want you to feel like a prisoner. I don't feel like a prisoner. See you tonight. Henrik is strange, it's like he's suspecting something. I almost couldn't get away today. Suddenly, he wants always to be with me. He thinks you have a lover. - Did he tell you? -Yes. A very strange conversation. - Are you kidding? - No. And he also offered for me to be his partner in "Sw?rd and L?wander." In what sense "partner"? We cannot continue like this. Do you want to leave me now? - It's probably for the best. - No! - You won't throw me away like an old rag! - I can't keep screwing you. You... You're married. With your new partner, yes. Makes it a bit more complicated. Good morning, sleepyhead. How long have you been here? I came recently. I was just dozing a bit. The nurse said you were here for hours, even after visiting time. How are you? I know what you want me to say: that I deserve it. Never do it again. I promise. - Help me get up. - No, don't even think about it. - You must rest for several weeks. - I have to go back to the kitchen! Believe it or not, the world goes on even without you. The kitchen is fine. Calle has proven his worth. Calle? It's too much responsibility for a kid like him! - Help me get out of the damn bed! - No, you'll have to do it alone. Should I be your crutch in the kitchen too? I thought so. - Salmon, table nine! - Thank you. May I ask for your attention? If you wonder how Chef Backe is doing, I can tell you that he is much better. -Calle has taken responsibility, haven't you? -Yes, cellar master. We are very grateful. You took the helm here and continued to do your normal work. He has really done a good job. Backe will be gone for quite a while, so I'll look for a lasting solution. You will see that it will be you who continues. I can't think of anyone else. I did some research. Various buildings at Drottninggatan will be expropriated. - Concretely, what does that mean? - Buildings will be emptied and demolished. We cannot invest in a restaurant that in a few years will no longer be. But I have another proposal. - What is that? - Operak?llaren. Operak?llaren? Right now they're having big losses. We can get a very good price. That's very interesting! Operak?llaren? - At least think about it. - Oh yeah. I definitely will ... I'm sorry to be late. You have the deal for the Americans, huh? I trusted you. Has something happened? I followed her. I wanted to know if she was seeing someone. Henrik ... Damn you! I thought you were my friend. I was going to make you a partner. Pick up your things and go. Go away! - Sorry, Peter. - We behaved like shit with him. We got what we deserved. It would be fine if I ... You can stay here. Unfortunately, Swedish women over 35 years old weigh too much.  - Hello!  - They also work too hard.  - Hello!  - They think that ...  No! It's my favorite show! You must hear this. A new album? Can we really afford it? The manager gave me a bonus. Do you have to waste it on new records? # I can't get my coconut. # # I tried from all the ways. # # With my little ax I hit him nonstop until it got stuck. # Something happened? You seem upset? - Where were you last night? - At work. Did you see her again? - See who? - Nina. No. What's wrong with you? Your coat smelled of perfume. Are you seeing someone else? No, I saw her at the restaurant. You arrived at three in the morning! Ethel said they went out together at midnight. Nothing happened. She was so drunk she couldn't stand. I took her home in her car and then I came directly here. - You could have said it. - Yes, I should have. Sorry. Don't do it anymore, please. Thanks, Gerd. They brought good cod. We marinate them and serve with horseradish. - Good Morning! - Good morning, Director. I have someone who can replace Backe during his convalescence. Someone who is caring, honest, and knows what Backe wants. Do you remember Holger? He will take care of the kitchen very well. - You might want to say a few words. - I have many good memories from here. - It will be a pleasure to work here again. - Welcome back. Let's move a little. Four to go. Food coming out! Ready. Outside! So! Now it starts to look like something. We have a new chef, Do you remember Holger? Are you kidding me? Backe wouldn't agree!  - I don't think Backe knows.  - Sorry, Calle.  It's only temporary. Backe will be back soon. - Hey! This is the chef's booth! - I have to go. See you later. I needed to make a call. - This is my kitchen now. You understand? - Yes, Chef. Here is the agenda. Well! Thank you! I declare today's meeting open. -Is this really the correct agenda? -Yes. But, there is not the issue of security at work for women. - It was discussed in the last meeting. - Yes, but it was postponed. I would like it to be added. - We already have a lot to talk about. - It is important to members. - For female members. - Thank you, Maggan. The next point It is the choice of the board. Candidates for election are found in annex one. Are there suggestions for other candidates? No, then it stays as is. Yes. I request to be a candidate for the position of president. Keep playing honey. Mom will come soon. Hi. Good day. - Have you thought about the proposal? -Yes. And? - Should we make an offer? - No. No ... it's a great opportunity, but do what you want. - So what did you want to talk about? - From Djurg?rdsk?llaren. - About you and me. - You and I? I am the director and I am the one who decides. You should not set foot in here again. The restaurant is mine too. I have both feet here. Not really. - What are you talking about? - You don't leave me any other choice. - Is that your signature? - What is that? Is that your signature? Yes, it is my signature. What is that? It is a contract in which you give me your part of the Djurg?rdsk?llaren. I have not signed any contract! Why would I give away my share? You just said it's your signature. - Let me see it. - So you can destroy it? - Let me see what it says! - You can get a copy. Are you crazy. I have not signed any agreement! - And when would you have signed it? - October 1946. October 46 ... It was when Suzanne left me. What the hell have you done, Gustaf? What the hell have you done? I will never accept this in my whole fucking life. Is that clear to you? You will regret this, I promise. Mother. Close the window.
