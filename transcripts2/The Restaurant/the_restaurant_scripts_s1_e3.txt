 -"Voila!" -Peter! Suzanne - a friend. She was rescued from an extermination camp. -Has Ethel given her a job? -She has brought food home. I calm down when I feel like food. The foreign woman is going away. Stay with me instead. -I have not done anything inappropriate. -Yes, and you get it. Be careful. You do not need to worry. Uno gets upset when she calls. You were not sorry for any man. You have a kid. You have nothing to do with it.

 Djurgårdskällaren has lost control over their overdraft facility. Unless it is regulated immediately we bankrupt the restaurant. No! It is rented here once a week. But jazz nights, like on Peace Day? It is completely out of the question. You know why. The sound is heard down in the dining room and disturb our guests. We wait with the dance until they are gone. Are you going to start the dance after 22.30? Get involved in the 50th anniversary, you. We sew up a dress for you, from 1895. That would be fun, wouldn't it? No. No jazz nights.

 Tell us! How you feel in the role of "herring girl"? Good! I could not be better. -I'm getting rid of Stickan. -Think how he treated you! He's angry, but he can cook. -What are you doing? -Petits-choux [small cabbage]. -If one doesn't turn out right, I'll let you try it. -Then I hope you mess one up! -I'm happy to get rid of him. -He seems diligent and talented. I do not trust him. You may regret taking care of him. You will regret letting him go. Just wait and you'll see. Jaha, hey? I've met Director Waern. We're threatened with bankruptcy. He has tried get to a meeting with you. I can't jump the instant they call. I have the anniversary to think about. -We'll discuss it with mom. -No! Our account is overdrafted by over 50,000 cronin! If I had a crown for every time they threaten me ... I'm in charge of the restaurant, and mother's not allowed to interfere. Okay. Then I demand a new meeting with the bank... Which I agree with. Ok, we will do that then. Satisfied? Can I continue working? -Hello? - "Hello, how goes it?" "Very well." How good it smells! -I made soup, if you want? -Gladly! - You do not have to cook for me. -I want to do it. I applied for a job today. On Thursday I go to the synagogue and meet the rabbi. He can help me get a room. How nice. There is no rush. You are welcome to stay here. We said one night. Already it's been several. Pst! Hey! God! It was absolutely wonderful. Yes, it was not bad. What? What? So damn hard ...! -How are you? -How the hell do you think? Do I sound happy? What a fucking stupid question! -I'm putting on a cup of tea. -No! -What has happened? -Peter is interfering in the restaurant! He's going to have a fucking meeting with the bank, and he's been gossiping to mother. -About what? -Why don't you just go to bed. You'll wake the children. Helga knows you can run the restaurant. I do not trust her. Peter will have his little bank meeting. Wake up! Wake up, Suzanne! Wake up, wake up. There is no danger. So. -All is well? -Ragnarsson. -Night delivery from Sundsvall. -Thanks. It seems demand continues to be strong. Have you ever made easier money? I have to ask you one thing. So! What do you think? -How do you figure it's been 50 years? -It depends on how you calculate. -Were you thirteen when you started it? -No, I was not. -There was another restaurant here then. -So IT celebrates 50 years? What a fuss! Does it matter? -Is it 1895 prices, too? -Only on the food. - Looks like there will be losses. - The margins are on the drinks. We will announce to all Stockholm that we have been here the longest. We should try to attract a new audience. Therefore, we will start with jazz evenings. - Does it never end? -A night! Jazz Evenings? The party floor is usually empty. I rent a band and invite my friends. -Friday was a success. -The sound disturbs the dinner guests. It's not possible. If you take a Tuesday, then? Then it is maybe only 30-40 guests in the dining room. - Against 100 in the party room. - Maybe 200! 200 guests? You're dreaming! Mother? ONE night, on trial. The party floor is still empty. The band should not be too loud. No! ONE night, on trial. - You have to put up with that. You're ruining the restaurant's reputation! -It took 50 years to build! -35 years actually ... Have you arranged an orchestra for the anniversary? -Suzanne is a pianist. -Then I have to count the keys later. Who is Suzanne? The one who worked here, in the kitchen. - Do you have contact with her? -Yes. -Now I have to go. -Me too. Goodbye. You stay. I want to talk to you. -But I've decided with Agnes ... -Listen to me! We'll talk now! I know you have visits at night. I'm not completely deaf yet. I have not had a visitor. -Who is it? -Who has not visited me? Stop being a tramp. Who is it? - What should I say? - It's over now. -You play roulette with your future. -Well, then, now I know. I saw "The Testimony" yesterday. -The one about the camp inmates? -Yes. You saw them in the white buses. - What joy there is around here. - You didn't see "Testimonials". -We will have neon eyes [lampreys] on the anniversary. -From one abomination to another ... -What are neon eyes? -A traditional, Swedish delicacy. It's like an eel at one end and a leech on the other. -You can have it on the buffet. -No one eats lampreys these days? They should. You can look for recipes. You can't come up tonight. Mom heard us. -Can we meet on my free evening? -Gladly. -When is it? -On Tuesday. On Tuesday? I can not. - You can't? -It's jazz night in the party room. Bad luck. I think about you all the time. Can I come to the jazz night? I don't mean that we should meet. Just that it would be fun to hear jazz. Of course. You are welcome to come. We have to pretend as if we have never met before. Helga: Nina, are you there? Gentlemen! Welcome! Welcome. Sit down. -Should I order for coffee? -Not for me, and I don't think for my brother either. I'm glad we're having this meeting. Now we can look ahead. I'm sorry for my harsh tone. My wife says my military background shows when i'm upset. Now I do not understand. -What? -You do not sound worried anymore. The debt is settled. I got the message yesterday. -Have you paid the credit? -Yes, it seems so. Yesterday, apparently. Yesterday, yes. -Do you think it was fun? -A little. -Where does the money come from? -I do not have to tell you. - I have the right to know. - Don't tell me how to do my job! You can do nothing! You know nothing! Dedicate yourself to your damn studies! -I want neon eyes. - Aren't those bastards exterminated? -Can you deliver or not? -Yes, if they are in our master's garden. But no one eats neon eyes today? -I'm arranging it myself. -Do not get mad! I myself love neon eyes! Fucking idiot. It's jazz night. A couple of you must be up there. Someone who wants to run up stairs and listen to cat screams? -I can do it. -Excellent. -Someone else? -I also. Cauliflower in the ears is recommended. Then let's go to work. Sorry I was nasty. Can we be friends again? Yes of course. I would need a room. Where do you live now? With a man I met in Varnamo. He also escaped the war. No, he's Swedish. He worked there. But he's a good man, very good. Can you tell us about what he experienced? A part, not all. Most people don't want to listen. He would listen, but... ...if I were to tell everything... ...I think he would understand that... ...that no one can go through that and truly remain whole. I dream every night. Horrible nightmares, about utterly terrible things. The dreams are like reality to me. More reality than when I'm awake. The city, the people where we are, the man I live with... ...all that is unreal to me. - Isn't the cellar master here? -No, he's out. I'm arranging a present for Gustaf. I understand. Then I won't bother you. -Are you ready to go? -Always. Would you like some "jazz tobacco"? A toke for a good cause. Let's go. Ladies and gentlemen, swing swings and jazz snaps! Hope you agree. Now it's here, what you've been waiting for: Rolf Gullin's quintet! My sister was going to book a band which made less noise - she said ... -Have you received the gift? What gift is that? I discovered your brother in your office. He said he was going to give you a present. -He has no shame! -You had the right to know. Feel free to keep your eyes open in the future as well. -Aren't they tied when you buy them? -Some are. -Are they more expensive? -On the contrary. I should have bought one of those. Wait. You can't go with it like that. For the money you paid, it should look good. I can do it myself. -Calle! Nice to see you! -Thanks. It's my free night. -How many of you will there be? -It's just me. I'll order right away. One pilsner and an egg and herring sandwich. I'll arrange that! Good evening. I'm looking for a Ragnarsson. -Who's asking? -Peter Löwander. -You're picking up things for Djurgårdskällaren? -No. But you have delivered there before? -What is it about? -Good evening. Peter Löwander. I've heard of you. I'm getting a little into the business, so I wonder about the loan to my brother. Which loan? You have lent us money, haven't you? A large amount. -Ask your brother. -I'm asking you. Why don't you ask your brother? I'm interpreting your response as "it's true." With all due respect you can interpret it any way you want. Co-owners have the right to transparency in such matters. One more thing to bring up with your brother. I can get us to change suppliers. I'm sorry, now I have to think about it. No, I haven't gotten mad yet.. Do you provide Gustaf with coupons? Are they fake or just stolen? -Now it's time for you to go home. -I will have answers to my questions. Do you want to bet? Excuse me, are you Miss Löwander? -Sture and Agnes are coming. What? Sture and Agnes are coming soon. Now come on. -Hello. -Good evening. -Sture. -Calle. - Is Calle having a good time? -Very. Does the miss want to do me the honor? Thanks, but unfortunately I'm busy. Look, there's Elsa. - Elsa! Have a nice evening. Calle talked to Nina Löwander! And now he looks completely devastated. There may be something to the gossip. - There's a party in the back. You going? - I think so. -What are you saying? -They threw me out, literally. -Are you injured? -No. -You have to tell Gustaf. -It probably wouldn't help. They have other business than deliveries. -What about business? -They shop with ration coupons. -You can ask Gustaf about that. -He scolds me when I ask. -But you don't know for sure? -I saw a note on Gustaf's table. - Did you search Gustaf's office? -I am worried! I'm going to talk to Gustaf about this, so you can concentrate on your studies. Why does he not just answer? I don't understand why you're still having contact with that Suzanne. She's a victim! She needs help! She lives at my house. -She lives with you ?! -For now, yes. -You have no responsibility for her! -No, but I might like her. -God! -You are not the boss of me. Peter. Peter! Nina: It's been a wonderful time. Good evening! We will do this again soon. I feel sorry for that sandwich going in and out of the kitchen all evening. -Hello. -Calle, huh? Sit down, by all means. -Have you had a nice evening? -Yes. -Do you like jazz, Calle? -Yes. - Do you have a favorite artist? -Sture ... I am interested. What does Calle usually listen to? Benny Goodman. Åke Hasselgård. -Dixie. -Yes, yes. -How funny he is! -Agnes: Quiet! Has Calle been alone all evening? I came after work. I didn't plan very well. - Does Calle work here? -Yes, in the kitchen. Really? As a chef, or a dishwasher? -Sune, I'm tired of your questions. -Sture, my name is. - I don't give a shit. - Did a monkey tie your tie? - Come on, I'll tell you all about it. - I'm fine here. Stop! Sture, stop! Sit down! - And you're coming with me! Agnes: That was damned unnecessary, wasn't it? -Go home! I work, do you understand? -You are hanging out with a lot of snobs! I'm sick, I might have a fever! I wanted to go home three hours ago! Instead, you hang on to every single guy. - You do not talk to me like that! -Nina ... You do not own me! You will never come to own me, because we are not a couple. -Is that understood? -Sorry. Now you go home and go to bed, your fucking idiot. -How is he? -He going home now. Cheers for that! -You go home too. What? You behaved like an idiot. You go home. Otherwise I'll send them all out. Bowl! What heavenly neon eyes! I couldn't wait for the anniversary. Here. Or do you want a glass? Strange that the children who give you the most troubles are the ones you love the most. Peter is so talented. He can be whatever he wants. -Running a restaurant is for lost souls. - Speak for yourself, you. -Is Peter thinking about the restaurant? -He says nothing. Gustaf thinks so. If you have to choose, do it soon. To wait makes it worse for the restaurant. The best for the restaurant is maybe the worst for my family. Hi. - Did I wake you? - No. I'll be quiet. I met the rabbi today. He arranged a room. I'm moving out tomorrow. How nice. If I dream tonight do not be afraid. -What do you dream about? -Nightmares. Nothing dangerous. Can I hold you if that happens? Yes. -Good night. -Good night. You are fine! Sorry. -I think I'm going now. -Maggan ... I was just fooling around! Calle, hey! Where have you been? What a nice tie! -Come on, we're dancing! -I'm too tired. Do as I say now. Come on! So how was the jazz night? Look under the bed, so you can sleep peacefully. You should have booked a quieter band. I heard every note. - I was full. - Jazz is a health hazard. We took in almost 16,000 crowns. You don't look happy. Has something happened? I'm just tired. Then I'll let you sleep. Did you say 16,000? If you ask them, maybe they can play quieter? -What are you going to do today? -I don't know. - Are you going to be out playing? -Mm. -Have you visited the calves today? -Mm. I'll get you home soon to Stockholm where I live. Uno? Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Hello! -He got a little tired, I think. -Yeah. Yes I understand. - Thank you Kerstin for this time.  - It was nothing. Goodbye. Hi. Hi. -It's probably fully booked tonight. -Yeah. -How do you attach this? -You can probably figure it out yourself. -Why does Carl want powder? -I have a headache. -Why? I was at a party yesterday. So, it's self-inflicted. -Can I have two? -Two?! That's the dose for a man, right? I work much better with two. -What are you doing? -You yawn too much. -You get half. -Please Greta ... -How nice they are. -Thanks! -Can I get one? Mom's birthday. -It's done. -I did not hear that. -Only once. That is an exception. Just so Stickan doesn't find out. You are a gem. Ethel too. -What is it worth, then? -Name your price. - You could take me to the movies tonight. - With pleasure! -You can take me too. -You're more than welcome. I'm just kidding. It's clear that you two should go together. -Ouch! -Stop whining. -At your age, I always wore one of these. -It was better before, but now it's quite painful. -Ouch! -Oh, did it hurt? I'll help you with jazz nights if you help me with the anniversary. Your dear brother was here yesterday. -He wondered whether you had borrowed money. He has crossed the line. He started talking about the coupons. Damn! He rummaged in my office yesterday. He must have found them! He can 't prove shit. Peter Löwander. What? -Yes? -Do you want to tell what us what he knows? Peter's words force me to terminate the agreement between Djurgårdskällaren and me. What are you talking about? It's a lie! You said the restaurant would look for a new supplier. That may be the result if you refuse to answer questions. Now on anniversary day we are without raw materials. Are you trying to sabotage the restaurant? I did not terminate the agreement! You have not been honest with me. Now the question is: what can we do at such short notice? Can Ragnarsson provide supplies? Under normal circumstances - no. I do not keep goods in inventory unnecessarily. But as I interpret the situation now it is the cellar master's words that apply. Of course! I have a good relationship with the cellar master. He is one of the most professional people I deal with. If I may say so, he is a legend in Stockholm's restaurant world. So if the cellar master wishes I'll see what I can do. We owe you a big thank you. If you'll excuse me I have much to do. -Thanks. -Thanks. - Are you blaming me? -Who else would be at fault? He is lying! How could you pay the bank 50,000 crowns all of a sudden? -Where did the money come from? -He still won't stop! My God! You borrowed the money from Ragnarsson, who provides you with coupons! I'm tired of your arrogance, Peter! You've been gone for 5 years, but think you can walk in and run the restaurant! -I can ask questions! -Gustaf does not have to answer them. It is Gustaf who decides here, and not you. Is that understood? I waited, but had to go now. See you soon. Suzanne General and Madam, welcome. So many people! The worst avalanche since Mannerheim took over Viborg! -A knight could bring order here, but his horse wouldn't be house trained.. What? House-trained horses? I dared to make a joke. Oh really? I won't let it become a habit. -You look very handsome tonight. -Tackar, you yourself are extra beautiful this evening. -Imagine, what if we met 50 years ago. -The thought is dizzying. I was cherished as a young woman, and passionate! Certainly. Grr! So. You are welcome. Dear guests! Today it is 50 years since I and my blessed husband opened Djurgårdskällaren. Is it possible that it has already been 50 year? Yes, I look young for my age. But it is you who make the restaurant what it is. It has survived two wars, one financial crash and Rulle Bohman's 40th birthday party. It has been a time of great change, but now a new era begins. One thing is certain: the earth never stops spinning. and it is equally certain that Djurgårds has not changed. And so I want to toast you, dear guests! Salud! Salud! We hope to see you on the 100th anniversary! Bravo! Four shrimp cocktails and four neon eyes! Hi. Lilly! -May I speak with you? -Talk. What happened yesterday, I ... I was taken by surprise. I have never... I didn't know how I felt. Everything is so complicated. I'll be bring my son home soon. There is nothing that is simple. But... But I like you. Curt! You were brilliant when you said what a legend I was in the restaurant world. -I didn't exaggerate too much? -No! It was brilliant! -I thought I heard your voice shaking. -I was a little moved, actually. -Your brother turned pale. -Peter doen't bother us anymore. Curt! Cheers and thanks! -Salud! -I will stay on top of you. -I can handle that. Given what you owe me, I basically own the restaurant. You could see it that way. We'll probably agree. Come on, Rigmor, lets go over here and play some piano. -on the black keys. Hi. Hi. I wanted to say "sorry." Thanks. How nice. I was stupid. It will not happen again. It wasn't just your fault. Sture can be a real idiot. Here. Taste. Very tasty. -Do you want? -No, it's for you. How is it? Nina? How are you?
