 What the hell is going on here? They're tearing down your and Dad's life's work! Peter and Nina must be allowed to implement their ideas. They have my full support. Keep an eye on my brother's fianc?e. Have you received a brochure from the union? You're fired. Get out! We demand Miss Nilsson's immediate re-employment. You're adorable. Your relationship with another woman would be of interest to the child welfare board. I am so happy. We are getting married! You're fighting at our engagement party? -Is there anything between you and this chef?

 -Suzanne has not been honest. -Jerome? Sarah? -You're using Suzanne to attack me! -Mr L?wander, Suzanne is not feeling well. It's our time now. Yours and mine. Calle, your mother is dead. Hi. Are you just getting back now? -Yes. What happened out on the island? We have been worried! I want to talk to you - alone. - Yesterday we drank too much. - I agree. Can we start over? The most important thing is that you are back. We cannot continue together. What? Do you want to break the engagement?

 Yes. -Because we had an argument? -Because I love someone else. Lelle, shouldn't you try to get some sleep? Lay down. Sonja wants to go home. Don't go! You ... Lelle, I'm here. Don't go. No, I Don't have to go. I can stay here tonight. Can you lie down a little then? And get some sleep. -Margareta has been fired. -Who? The waitress who is in the union. -She can look for work elsewhere. -It's not even legal to do that. Who cares? I don't understand why you care so much. We're co-workers! Do you think the waiters would move a finger if a chef had problems? No way! Yes, Maggan would have. I don't want the union here. Instead of learning the job, young people fight with managers over their rights. Soon no one can even boil eggs, and that's the union's fault. It is good to make demands sometimes. This is how society gets better. Have you become a communist in your old age? I'm not a communist, and I'm not old! - Do you know how Maggan is doing? - Not so good. -Is she looking for a job elsewhere? -Yes. She really wants to come back here, but the boss believes that the union is the devil. Who told you that? Has Miss Lindstr?m heard me say that the union is the devil? So you're standing here lying? Miss Nilsson didn't lose her job because of the union. She had been negligent with her work. Good, then we know. I apologize. I'm looking for a job elsewhere. I'm sorry if I gave you a wrong impression, but I'm actually not a fighter. Well, you have the right on your side. And how long does it take to get justice? Nobody knows. -We can help you with money. -It's not that. It's a really stressful situation. The union will continue to pursue this case. Whether you participate or not, the battle will proceed. You have started something very big, and you're a perfect plaintiff. Are you really going to give up? Arenn't you going to take on this fight? -When do you think she'll wake up? -It may take a while. - Will she be herself? -Impossible to say. She seems to have problems with perception of reality. It may pass after some rest, or it may persist for the rest of life. She has a number tattoo on her arm. -Has she been in a concentration camp? -Yes. This may be due to trauma from there. We have had such cases before. Maintain the Nembutal dose for the next 24 hours. -See you later. -Thanks. I broke up with Erik. -What are you saying? -I don't love him. Have you gone completely crazy? No, Nina. You can't behave like this! This has consequences, not just for you, but for all of us! I love another. - What kind of stupidity is that? Who is it? - Stay out of my life. -Is it the one who made you pregnant? -Thanks for the breakfast. Now you answer me, Nina! Good day. - Sorry, are you Philippe? -Yes. I'm peter I tried to contact you. Suzanne suffered a nervous breakdown. - How is it going? - She's in the hospital. The doctor thinks ... ...it might have something to do with having lived in the concentration camp. Suzanne has told me some of it, but not all. If Suzanne didn't tell you, it's not my duty to do so. That's true. But now she's sick and I want to help her. I need to know more. Some things cannot be expressed. We keep them inside. You had children? We almost lost them in the cattle car. The trip lasted several days. Every time we stopped there were another 5 or 10 dead. Children... crushed. Seniors... they couldn't take it anymore. It was terrible. When we got to the camp it was almost a relief. We thought we had made it, we and the children. But... But they took Sarah and J?rome almost immediately. They were so exhausted that they didn't even protest. A soldier took them, one in each arm. I will never forget the look from Sarah when she turned around. She was four years old. After a week I understood that they were dead. But Suzanne never accepted that the children ...  ...that they were gone.  "Pelle had never seen anything so strange. " "Surely it was a tail without a cat?" Come in! -Hello. -Hello. Hi, Lennart. I'm going out for a while, just. "One of those..." "I would like to have such a long and beautiful tail." -Mom has died. -What? She died yesterday while we were on the island. No! Calle ... She had a heart attack here at home. Everything is upside down, as you can imagine. -Is there anything I can do for you? -No. I think things will work out. I've talked to Erik. I've broken the engagement. Good! -I have not spoken to Sonja yet. -I understand. -I love you. -And I love you. -Will I see you tomorrow? -Absolutely. I applied for a job at Gillet today, but they didn't need anyone. If you don't come back, I'll quit too. It's no fun without you. I'm going to go. You ... Thank you for coming. Good evening. Put Erlander on the cream shelf. I thought the Social Democrats were above these things. -Do you want to seat the Prime Minister? -I'm going to see Suzanne at the hospital. -How is she? -She's sedated. Our thoughts are with her. Mr. L?wander? I wonder if you have a few minutes. Yes. -I've been fired. -I didn't know that. -Why? -Because I joined a union. -Is it Roos who fired you? -No, it was the cellar master. -Due to union activity? -He claims that I was negligent at my job. I don't want to fight this. I'm looking for a job elsewhere. But the union is moving forward with the conflict in any case. I just wanted to warn you. Some of my colleagues have also joined the union. Lilly, for one. -I hope it does not affect them. -No. -I'll talk to Gustaf about your job. -Thanks. Good day! As you were, Roos. We'll find the way ourselves. Has there been a misunderstanding? -Your lunch booking is for tomorrow. -Then you have booked the wrong day. Your table is occupied by Minister Erlander. Never heard of him. He can change tables. Gentlemen! I'm sorry, but you have been placed at the wrong table. - Sorry... - Oh, finally, Director! We have been sitting at this table since late 1915, in the spring. Then we won't disturb your habits. We'll change tables. Well, thank you. The general knows how to deal with Social Democrats. You don't force a minister in the Swedish government to change tables! They need to be put in their places. They are talking about raising the tax rate to 25%. It's pure robbery! Here they are to be treated with dignity! Do you know what they will spend the money on? Family child allowances! As if people are not breeding enough! What's next? A subsidy for drinking and playing poker? I spoke with the vicar of the church of Stefan. We can do the ceremony there. - But the burial will be in the north. - What is a burial? - When you put the coffin underground. - What coffin? The coffin with the deceased inside. Mom's coffin. - Will she be underground? -Yes. Hey Lelle ... Lelle ... - I have to return to work. - Go, no problem. You... Calm down, Lelle. Hi dear. It's okay. - Good day. - We are from Social Services. - Do you have time to answer questions? -Yes. What do you usually eat for breakfast? Porridge, usually. Of oats or barley. - And what else? - He has lunch with Mrs. Andersson. She takes care of him while I work. And at dinner a sandwich and some fruit. Sometimes when I work late, he has dinner with Mrs. Andersson. Do you have a permanent job? At this time, the situation is not clear. Our information says you don't have a job. - Who said that? - We can't say. I was fired without a valid reason, so I'll be back to work soon. - Well, we're done for now. - Well, what happens now? Our report will be the basis of any possible action. You will know soon. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. We're investigating Uno Nilsson. You take care of him during the day, right?  Yes, it's true.  Do you have time to answer some questions?  - What's wrong with her? - At least now she's woken up. - Terrible story. - Save the crocodile tears. I'm not a monster, Peter! Remember I told you that you didn't know her. Was I wrong? Why was the waitress fired? Was it because of union activity? No, she had been negligent with work. - In what way was she negligent? - Peter, I take care of the staff. She says the Union will continue with this. She came to warn me about that. We have a meeting on Tuesday. Don't worry, they will back off. - Can I come in for a moment? - Yes! - Hello, Uno. - Look what I've built! - A cup of coffee? - I already drank with the inspectors. I know you saw Lilly yesterday. She was here as a friend, nothing more. These inspectors they asked many questions. They forced me to tell the truth. That there is no better mother than you. Uno couldn't be better off with anyone else. The rest is not their business. Thank you! I think I will take that cup of coffee anyway. Yes, builder! What are you doing? - What do you remember from that night? - I touched. Then I don't remember any more. - How are you now? - All right. Have you ever experienced anything like this before? You don't know what caused it? Let's do this... If your condition improves, we will decrease the medicine. You have to rest. - Miss Goldstein. - Jerome? Sarah? Jerome? Sarah? Where are you going? Come with mom. Wait. Come back to the room. Sarah, Jerome! Come with mom! Help me. Now we take it easy. Come on! Come on! Leave me! Mom had put money away, so did I. So I can buy both a coffin and a wreath. - Tell me if you need more. - We'll be okay with what we have. Ethel and Splinter will give me a hand with food. Sonja lives with me now. Lelle is totally desperate, and ... This is not going to work, Nina. If I part with Sonja, I don't know what will happen to Lelle. He clings to her. I can't have it on my conscience. I love you. Immensely. More than I ever loved. But maybe we are not meant to be together. Sorry. It's not your fault. If Erik and I were right for each other what happened on the island would never have happened. It's not your fault. I need to take a walk. - Now? -Yes. I can't go with you? That's right, I have to go alone. It's not safe now, Nina. You have no right to tell me what I can do. My dear ... I tried to escape. I didn't find them. They found me. You know they are not real. I know, but at the same time I don't know. - Are they talking to you? -Yes. Today we talk about that time in the forest of Boulogne ... When you fell into the pond - They had a lot of fun. -Yes. No one has seen their bodies. - We can't be sure. - Suzanne ... And while I'm talking to them I think that they're alive. Did you talk to Peter? No. I don't know how to do it. I know that... that is not healthy. Let's go. We have to go back. If they don't reinstate Margareta within a week, we'll pickett the restaurant. Our members will stay here 24/7 ... and inform their customers and the public of the conflict. It is a disproportionate measure. Negotiations are still ongoing. - What does Miss Nilsson think? - I agree with the Union. - Do you realize the consequences? - Yes, I hope to get my job back. Do nothing that you may come to regret. Does the director mean that can I lose custody of my child? Social Services did an investigation. I have the decision here. They have nothing to say about how I take care of my son. You contacted Social Services, right? You have threatened Margareta that they would take her son away from her. These accusations are completely unfounded. This is what it will say in the newspapers tomorrow. Gustaf. I advise you to accept before this gets to the newspapers. She can't go back to work. Never. Nina!  Nina, have you talked to Erik?  Hey ...  Mom, I know how you think! Do not insist! Nina. Nina. My sweety! I know you think this is theend of the world, but ... Talk to Erik. He will understand your temporary confusion. And when one day you look back on this, you will laugh with all your heart. Mom, please. Why is it so important to you? Because in a few years all your friends will be married with children. And what will you do then? I'll be runing the club. I have a job. But why? You must get married. Gustaf will take over the club. Gustaf knows nothing about jazz or what attracts young people. But the restaurant and the club are one thing, he is the director. The club was my idea. I created it. Don't be fooled into thinking of having a career in the restaurant. You have two brothers, and it's not even enough for them. We'll see. Djurg?rdsk?llaren restaurant. Good day! I haven't read the newspaper yet. Ah, is that so? Minister Erlander has canceled, due to our "anti-union" position. Now what they write in the newspapers, is it true? Keep going. Erlander also said that no government representative will come, ... of ministries or of government departments. Damn bureaucrat! The article says the decision was made by the First Minister. "Per Albin is disappointed." - I warned you. Fix this. - Don't tell me what to do. - Re-hire Margareta. - I take care of the staff. - So do it now, Gustaf. - Stop meddling in everything I do! Gustaf, calm down. We must get back in the government's good graces. We need them as customers. No, Mom, we shouldn't. We have other clients. Nobody goes to a restaurant which is blacklisted by the government! Re-hire the waitress and call Erlander. - Why don't you marry Erik? - Because I don't love him. But you were happy before what happened on the island. If I can't have Calle I don't want anyone else. - Stop feeling sorry for yourself. - I don't! Yes, you do. You have been so lucky! Erik is beautiful, charming, talented and caring. And is rich. - Then marry him. - Maybe I will! 3. 4. 5 00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,040 I wish you much happiness. You are very childish and stupid, Nina. I don't want your advice. Goodbye. You have no reason to be so unhappy! I can't see you like this anymore! The message to Erlander should be that the picketting is based on a misunderstanding.  Not because of union activity. It's a lie. - Do you want your job again or not? - I'll get my job back. So you say it was a misunderstanding and that everything is resolved. Then they will allow the Union to enter Djurg?rdsk?llaren. You can't make new demands now! And you will say that you value the work of the Union as an aid to your  business. I will never say that. I really appreciate the work of the Union. It helps us develop our business. - I like that. - This is based on a misunderstanding. It was not due to Margareta's union involvement. Let's say there were ... incidents, so to speak. They have to do with the method of work by Margareta. But that was left behind. I like Djurg?rdsk?llaren, where the Union has such a strong position. For example, the representative can do union activity during working hours. All thanks to the modern vision our director has about the Union. I am very happy to hear that. Well! Yes. Thank you very much. Do you already know Professor Karin Kock? - Gustaf L?wander. - Margareta Nilsson. - Have you visited Djurg?rdsk?llaren? - No. I can recommend that. Very good food and good service. - Trade unionism at work? No! - So I misunderstood the director. I want to apologize. I get it if you never want to see me again. It's that I greatly value my freedom and independence. I panicked at the idea of getting married. It's about the cook, huh? Calle? Yes. Before you & I met I had an affair with him. On the island it resurfaced. It won't happen again. - I wish I could trust you. - You can. Give me another chance. I love you, that's not the problem. Maybe what happened was good. Can we be completely honest with each other? What do you mean? I love your spirit of independence. But I'm a traditional person with traditional expectations. You make it look so boring. If we get married, I want to start a family. Have kids as fast as we can. You will have to take care of the house. We will have servants, but someone will guide them. This home role can't be combined with your work in the restaurant, or in the club. I see. Also, Calle works there. I don't want you to see him so regularly. It sounds like a condition. It is. - Do you want to go to dinner with mom? - I don't think so. I don't want to force you, but there is a life out there waiting for you. Maybe it's time to try in small doses. Come, let's sit down. I know there is a life out there. But I can't share it with you, Peter. - What do you mean? - I don't live in the same world as you. - I have the children with me. I see them. - That will pass. But I don't want it to happen. And I feel like I've cheated on you. - How? - I've shown you a facade. - Pretending that I was okay. - You'll be fine. I won't return to your house. I have asked to be transferred to a hospital in Paris. And when I get there, I will Start looking for my children. And Philippe? He will help me with the move. Can you understand that? I am crushed. - How many guests? - Including the Prime Minister, five. Two are Norwegian, so we will display both flags. They will sit here. - They will sit here? - Albin wants to be isolated to play bridge. - Absolutely isolated, it won't be. -Yes, I know. How will the other customers get to the bathroom? - They'll use the bathroom in the party room. - All the way up there? I can't do anything, it's Per Albin! - We will get married at Oscar Church. - Cute! - Yes. Will you make a new announcement? - No. - Why should we? - No, it'll be fine. Unless the bride herself has some objection to the wedding. - Mother! - I just don't want to wait. - Dinner will be in the party room. - Oh ... don't tell me. - Couldn't Peter come? - Yes, I don't know what happened to him. Escaping seems to be a family tradition. Mom, if you keep up like this, you can go too. We will marry, with or without you. It will probably be alright. Isn't it time to toast? Health! For the young couple! Prime Minister, it was an honor to have you as a guest. We look forward to it again. Thank you. - Per Albin, not bad, despite everything. - He seems to be a friend of the king. A true patriot! Unlike that paper pusher Erlander. He'll never come to anything. What the heck is going on now? Peter, it's time to go home. She has left me. Now let's go. Drink this. She doesn't love me. Now nothing makes sense. I might as well die. Here it is, just as you asked. Is it bullet proof? It will be very difficult to contest it. Thank you for doing it on such short notice. Did you hear that Per Albin is dead? No, he was at the restaurant yesterday. He collapsed in ?lsten. A heart attack, it seems. That's sad to hear it. Why would you want Peter to sign that? He wants to study and then work abroad. We'll talk tomorrow. So. What? What is it? Sign here now, Peter. Sign here. There. That. Good. Now you can sleep.
