 We have discovered that you have a congenital defect in heart rhythm. This defect in combination with angina can be severe. -How serious? -Life-threatening. A person called for you, Gunnar Wegetoft. I was 20 years old when you got me pregnant. Now we manage on our own. - Do you want to buy Oscarshof? - Gustaf will see it as a war. -I would be extending a hand. -He'll have nothing to do with it. I'm going to buy Oscarshof on my own. To be able to afford it, I have sold my share of Djurgårdskällaren. -More red cabbage is needed. -Hans-Erik, smoked eel! -The chef hears poorly. -Yes I know.

 Shouldn't you and Nina have a little one, then? Uno's father wants to see him. I haven't told Uno. You can't sell to someone other than us. Good evening. Merry Christmas. Who's Henriette Winter? She bought Nya Teatern this spring. I don't know any more than that. -How is your chest pain, Mom, better? -Yes, it's going to be fine now. -You have to talk sense into Gustaf. -Enough is enough, right? Let him leave us. We'll buy his share. He must remain a co-owner, Peter. He doesn't contribute anything. Yet he takes his full share of the profits. He's still part of the family. I'm sorry you found out about my plans that way.

 How could you make such a scene? It was so degrading. I'm doing this for us, Astrid. I choose us over them. The restaurant profit is all the income we have. Oscarshof can be as good as Djurgårdskällaren. And there, I have a job. We can just barely afford the children's boarding school. -It's my inherited money. -Stop! You have put our entire finances at risk. I hope you know what you're doing. I'm going to call Betty. She and Mads have moved back to Copenhagen. -They might know who she is. -It can't hurt to ask . -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. He owns a share in a restaurant that make a lot of money... ...which he wants to sell- -to buy into a restaurant which is in decline. Nina? I'm going to the union now. Can you try to get out a little today? You hear? You and Christer maybe can skate or something? -Uno, can you hear me? -Yes, but could you give me some peace and quiet? -What is it? -It's nothing. I know that it's something. -Is there a friend who ... -Has my dad asked to see me? I'm on my way. I'll just take the last boxes. Jump out. Come here. Now comes the next spaghetti. One more here ... -What's your name then? -Yes. What? You gotta learn Swedish, damn it! Come here. This is where you'll be working. Your countryman will show you what you'll be doing. Okay? Good. -Hello. My name is Angelo. -Sandro. -Where are you from? -From Naples. -Don't stand staring. Get to work. -Sorry. -I come from Catania. -Welcome to paradise. Cellar Master, here's the invoice from last month. Thanks. I see new faces around here all the time. Some leave for jobs in industry. Then you have to find replacements, so it's a lot of work for me. You work harder than the dishwashers, huh? The cellar master has nothing to complain about, right? It is hardly possible to hire dishwashers cheaper than these. -I'll make sure the bill gets paid. -Good. -As Mrs. Winter must have seen ... -Miss Winter. Miss Winter. I apologize. Paragraph 8 refers to a first-refusal clause in the shareholders' agreement. It means that no transaction can take place until the co-owners have had a chance to make a counter-offer. I understand. - Have you told your family about it? Yes, yesterday. -On Christmas Eve? -Yes. Yes, that was a nice little Christmas present. What did they say? They aren't entirely enthusiastic. I had not expected that they would be. I get to meet them and explain what I want. -Yes absolutely. - Shall we move on? -Yes. Paragraph 9 then ... Place any bid you want. I'm not going to sell my share to you. We want you to be more active in DK again. If we buy Oscarshof together you can be. -I don't trust Peter. -Peter actually doesn't decide everything. Wait until you disagree and you will get to see who he really is. -Gustaf, can't we just try ... -No. I have received a very good offer from Henriette Winter and I will take it. -And you'll invest it all in Oscarshof? -You're not involved. Do you know that Strömvall has been involved in a lot of bankruptcies? So you're saying you can't trust Bojan Strömvall. But at the same time, you're very keen on buying her restaurant? If we can buy her out, yes, but not otherwise. You're so transparent, Nina. - Do you think I'm trying to fool you? - Are you? No. You turn my words around when I try to give you good advice. I don't need any advice from you. I'm doing great on my own, thank you. He's doing this to screw us. Had it been about money, he'd have asked for a counter offer. -I have to try to talk sense ... -How much will he be allowed to humiliate us? Peter, it's your brother we're talking about. Peter Löwander. Good day, Mrs. Winter. Good day, Miss Winter. Well thank you, it has been good. Less than you might think but it would be nice to see you. Shall we meet at the restaurant? I was there before Christmas. It will be a nice reunion. Table 5, Henriette Winter. She made a strong impression. -Oh really? How? -Yes, she's Danish. She talks a lot. And loud. In Danish. And then she's pretty extravagantly dressed. And she smokes cigarillos. Yes, thank you, Roos. It was  nice of you to take time out of your free day. She was clearly here to take a look. I've found out a bit about Winter that you might find interesting. -How are you? -Better. If only it were over ... - Do you feel anything moving? -No, it's too early. You know if it's a girl or a boy? -How could I know that? -I don't know. If something sticks out on the front, would that mean it's a boy? Where did we leave our name lists. What girl name did we have now again? Lill. Magdalena. It's too early for thinking about names. This pregnancy will go well, so don't be worrying. I want to meet him. What's his name? Gunnar. Why did you never say anything? about him? -You did not ask. -Yes. You said he did not exist anymore. I was probably still very angry on him then. We can invite him here if you want, someday. No, I want to meet him myself. -Good night. -Mm. -So. Say something. -What should I say? Say anything. Dr. Boman has prescribed me a diet that drives me crazy. -I hear no difference. Is it on? -Stig, I'm going soon. -May I just try the other one? -Do it quickly, then ... Talk. Now that I'm going to meet this terrible woman from Denmark- -I'm really hungry. But we want to lower her into the harbor with a lump of concrete around the feet. - Stand by the wall and talk. -Yes, but then you need to go. And so, talk quietly now, we'll see what I can hear standing over here. -You probably hear what you want to hear. -One more time. -You hear what you want to hear. - "You hear like a new ear." Fantastic, Stig. That's exactly what I said. She made a fortune in the theater industry in Denmark. There's a lot of talk about her in Copenhagen. She comes from Ålborg originally. They say she ran a brothel there. I think we can benefit greatly from each other. Before you make a long speech ... Mrs. Löwander, please. Just give me a few minutes. I read in the newspaper about plans for the restaurant. It would be more like a large club. I think that's the right way. Don't believe everything you read in the newspaper. I did something similar with my restaurant in Copenhagen, and it became a great success. It doesn't mean that it's right for us. No, of course it doesn't. I just meant it as a compliment. - A little coffee? -Yes thank you. As you may know I own the New Theater. I thought of a package with a dinner with you-  -and a performance with me. Miss Winter, why are you doing this? I like to do something new. And it will be good business for both parties. So it's not about becoming respectable, then? That you're trying to escape your reputation ... ... and create a more respectable one here in Stockholm? Mrs Löwander, please understand that this isn't what I intended. It must be difficult for you to have a son sell his share of the family business. But he wants to. And the sooner you accepted this fact, the better. And the sooner that you accept the fact that we don't want you as a partner- -the better. If I may be completely honest, your mother is a witch. -I can't object to the substance. -She doesn't understand what's best for the restaurant. I totally agree with you. But my siblings do. Do they dare speak out against her? Nina has always stood up against Helga. You two will probably come to get along well. -And is there a brother? -Peter will understand. Helga Löwander is still a leading partner. Do you want to stick to your bid? Yes. I'm not going to give up so easily. Then we wait for the family's counter-offer. They have two weeks. A steak! Food in the door! Oh, wonderful! Two sole, very good. -How is it going at the union? -It's fine. -What issues are you pursuing now? -We want tips to disappear. The status of tipping would change. -Would it be forbidden to tip? -The customer would be free to add a tip. But it would not be expected. I'll let you eat in peace and quiet. Hope you enjoy the sole. You were going to say something? -No, it ... it was stupid. -Say it. -No, it was nothing. -Yes, tell us. If you are interested, you are welcome to attend a meeting at the union club. It would be an honor to have you. But then I thought that it would be presumptuous to invite you. When can I come? DK Club. Mrs Löwander, phone call for you. Thanks. -Nina. -Good evening. This is Henriette Winter. -Good evening. -I'm not calling too late, am I? I would like to meet you and talk, just the two of us. -Mrs. Löwander? -I, Helga and Peter ... ... have no secrets from each other. Why should we meet alone? I think there may be a better atmosphere than before. Our goal is to keep Gustaf as co-owner. You know as well as I do that he is determined to sell. The future belongs to you, Mrs Löwander. That's why I want to talk to you. I need to ask you some things,  Bojan. I hope you don't take this as distrust on my part. What happened to Najaden? Yes, you ... Do you want the long or the short answer? -Start with the short. -Too many chefs. Jonsson who had been there for a hundred years and thought the place was his. Then there was me. Brunneman was responsible for the money- -but did not have a clue how to run a club. I also lost a hell of a lot of money, no matter what you're hearing. Call Jonsson and you will hear his version, undoubtedly different. Maybe I will. You know, I love this restaurant very much. Still, it was I who ended up in debt when everything went downhill. -You know how it feels, right? -Yes, thank you, I know quite well. -I'm going to bed. -He's not on time even the last night. -Good night. -Good night. Gustaf, this could be yours. Here you can realize all your dreams. Yes, but it's a lot of money we're talking about. It's all I get out of selling my share of Djurgårdskällaren, and then some. -But you take the time you need. -Thanks. You can finish up. See you tomorrow. Yeah, see you tomorrow. The whole kitchen is waiting. This one must be done first. Hurry up, you lazy bones. -Your eyes don't seem to be focused. Are you drunk? -Stop now. -I need the pot. -Go away. How are you doing? Good. Oh my God... Good morning. You missed their last night at home, which was last night. -I thought it was tonight? No, we talked about it yesterday morning. -Where are they? They haven't gone yet, have they? -Yes, they've both gone. They are well on the way to Gränna by now. I'm sorry. I was in a meeting all last night. Bojan wanted to talk about how to value Oscarshof. What is it? - Did you sit in a meeting? -Yes. - Did you do that, Gustaf? -Yes, I told you so. What is it? Astrid, what ... Wow, they're really good. - Do you have a minute? - Sure. - Did you think they would go over here? -Yes. It's called rock and roll. I know what it's called, but I'm not so sure it fits here. Only teenagers listen to stuff like that. And how would we make money on teens? In a few years, everyone will be listening to rock. Then maybe we'll play rock then. -Or we do it now. -Or you don't decide. Neither I nor mother have heard anything from Henriette yet. -So to be prepared, we should prepare a counter offer. I have to get back to my band. - Did you hear what I said? -Yes. -I want to apologize for mom. -No problem. I understand Helga. Change can be difficult. But I'm very impressed with what You've done with DK. Hey, Carl-Gustaf! Health. This is Carl-Gustaf Lindstedt. - Nina Löwander. Have you met before? Yes, sometime at DK Club. Yes, it is you who have DK, yes. Yes, it's possible we've been seen in the hustle & bustle at some point. I'm going for makeup, so I have to ... Good job! Did you know that there was a restaurant? here when the theater opened? -No. Garnier Restaurant. It was very popular. Would you perhaps feel like opening it again? You can put in a wall-to-wall bar counter. - You don't give up so easily. - You can't accuse me of that. -Isn't it lovely? -Yes. DK is also a kind of theater where you do shows. Then you can see the possibilities. We can do amazing things together. Come on. I'll show you the bar. When was the last time you ate and drank something? When ... did you eat? You have not eaten anything? Has no one ever told you that the staff should eat? Going hungry is not wise! -You're welcome to help yourself. Thanks. Angelo, now you must eat, drink and rest. Do you understand? Food in the door! Chef. Are you looking for something? -No, no, it's a new device. -Yeah. How is it? Yes, it's much better. That's good. -Yeah, then we have the mussel soup there. -Yes, Chef. Mmm. Good. Come on, you two over there can unload this. How do you actually manage your staff? - All right. Why do you ask?? You must inform the dishwashers how things work here. One of the boys fainted because he had worked for a whole day... ...without food or drink. He had no idea that the staff here gets fed. Yes, I trust the experienced ones to teach the new ones. It's dumb for me to try to explain it to them when other workers speak the same language, right? I'm going to talk to the union about this. And with the cellar master. Ethel, I'm going to get this ... Have you noticed that you have many workers from Southern Europe where you work? No, not with us. I want to adjust the agenda a bit. Next point, information from the Social Democratic Women's Union. -I'm handing over to Britt Gahn. -Thank you, Margareta. And excuse me for coming like this in the middle of your meeting. Chef. Chef? Chef! A party out there wants to thank you for the food. - Do you have time, or should I ...? -The device. - Maître d '. Maitre! - Yes? I found this in my soup and I don't think it should be there. Strange. An issue we will spend a lot of time on in future is that of Swedish nuclear weapons. The government wants to investigate the issue, and we strongly oppose it. Sweden can't argue for stoping the spread of nuclear weapons- -if we get them ourselves. Erlander doesn't want us Social Democrats even discussing it- -but I'm ignoring that. That was all I had to say. You're welcome to become a member of our organization. Thank you. Thank you for coming here. Yes, it was fun. Is it okay if I sit and eavesdrop a little? I didn't take too much time, did I? No. I just moved higher in their eyes when I could present Britt Gahn. They seemed to have a very high opinion of you already. -Where are you going now? -Home. I live on Bryggargatan. Well, then you'll move soon. -Are you going to miss the Klara neighborhood? -No, not in the least, actually. It's crowded and too windy. Plus, I need to find something bigger. My son is 13 and wants his own room. My husband has built new, nice apartments in Vällingby. -Maybe one of them would suit you? -Yes, but aren't they already full? I think there are some left. I'll talk to the municipality. -Well, see you! -Yes. Bye. Listen, everyone! I know you enjoyed it that I dropped my hearing aid into the soup. It was great fun. Thor Modéen (Swedish comedian) couldn't have done it better. I'll no longer use the device- -but don't believe that you can do whatever you want behind my back. I'm not deaf and I'm definitely not blind. -Is that understood? -Yes, Chef. -Is that understood?! -Yes, Chef! Good. Swedish Radio, Stockholm. From here Radiotjänst's studio on Kungsgatan 8- -we who are at the station broadcasting on this new year's eve- - wish our listeners all the best for the new year. -Good evening! We meet again. -Miss Winter. Welcome. -If you come with me. -This way. Here you go. A private room, as requested. Dear friends, sit down and feel at home. -Who wants a pilsner and a schnapps? -I. Ten beers and ten Aalborg aquavit. Quick! I'll just go and say hello to an acquaintance. I'll be right back. And no one touches my Aalborg. Peter! Happy New Year! I have the theater gang with me. You can read about it in the newspaper tomorrow. You are all welcome. They will order more than all your other guests combined. Hello! Do you work here? Yes. Peter Löwander, cellar master. What does Mr Lindstedt want? - Dom Perignon, huh? - I'm arranging that. Löwander, you said. Do you have a sister named Nina? -Yes. -We met at the theater. -Has Nina been to the New Theater? Yes, she apparently knows Miss Winter, theater director. -I'll get the champagne. -Excellent. Take in a bottle of Dom Pérignon to Mr. Lindstedt. -I want to talk to you. Now. -Yeah? I must apologize. Thank you, thank you, ladies and gentlemen. -Leave us alone. Get out of here. -What are you doing? Have you met Winter behind my back? -It's not like ... -If you cheat on me, I'll throw you out. You won't have anything left. Do you understand? Do you understand? What is it? I don't know. I think I'm bleeding. What? Can you pick up Calle? You have to pick up Calle. I'm bleeding. We need help here. She's bleeding. Come with me. - You can wait here. Sit down for a while. You should not order hash. Two of each starter and two of each main course. What? Two of all main courses. Two of all entrees. Complicated order. Two of all entrees, two of all main courses. Two of all entrees. Two of all main courses. -Yes, great idea. -But there was some kind of ... horse. Do you want to be front or rear? Can we calm down a bit? -Gentlemen... -They refuse to go and sit down. So, gentlemen ... do you belong somewhere? -At the theater. Don't you recognize us? -Okay. Settle down in here. Mrs. Löwander! Happy New Year! Yes, it was Helga Löwander. Cheers to Helga! Take them up to the party floor. Yes, you are welcome to relocate up to the second floor. Second floor. Hello? No danger? Nina has only had a little bleeding, but it is perfectly normal. -This should not affect your pregnancy. -Thanks. -Take care. -I will. -Are you still here? -Sorry. -This was not your fault. -Sorry. I have to go back to the restaurant, but maybe we can see each other tomorrow? Gladly. -Yes, congratulations. -Thanks. We had not thought ... I won't say anything. Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven- -ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five- -four, three, two, one, happy new year! Cheers everyone, for a really successful 1956. Cheers and happy new year! -Happy New Year! Back to work! -Good evening. See you tomorrow. -Gustaf, do you have just a minute? Of course. Do you know who Ragnar Bååth is? He has Statt in Västerås. Yes, among other things. -He has placed a bid on Oscarshof. -I understand. He wants to establish himself in Stockholm. But I have not answered yet. I would much rather do this with you. But the bid is good and he is serious. When does he need to be notified? He wanted to be notified on Thursday, but I wanted to talk to you first. Gustaf, has the sale of DK gone through? - You have the money, right? -Of course. I have it. -I don't want to put preassure on you. -No, no problem. Let's go ahead. Okay. Good. -Then we celebrate with a glass. -Absolutely. -Löwander. -It's me. Are you going to outbid Winter?? -Yes, good luck to you too. -I want the deal finished ASAP. We have explained to Winter that we do not want her as co-owner We think she will withdraw her offer. Then you think wrong. But Gustaf, think about it now. Deep down, you don't want to sell, do you? Yes, I want to sell. We need to see each other. I can sell to you instead, if it goes quickly. -I'll need to talk to Nina and Peter. -Good. I'm ashamed of yesterday. I understand you got angry. I should have told you. -We must try to stick together. -That we shall. That was very nice of you to wait at the hospital. Suzanne said you were the only one really good person she met. - Do you have any contact with her? -No. -Hey, Uno. My name is Gunnar. -I know. -Hey, Margareta. -Hello. -Uno, shall we get go in? -Yes please. -Bye. -Bye . Yes, Benke, put them right there. Yes, did you check those? There should be five. -Sorry... -Yes? -I, salary. -What are you saying? -I, salary. -Salary? I understand, you want your salary. I have to deduct for lodging, because you live here. You have eaten at the restaurant. I have to deduct for that too. So sadly there is nothing left. There will be no salary this week. Sorry, but I did not understand the last so good. If you don't complain and gossip with the usual staff, and just do your job- -maybe there'll be pay next week. Capisce? Just put the last boxes there, further into the warehouse Can I help with anything? Are you looking for someone? No. Sorry. I was just leaving. Thanks. -With Andersson? -I do not hope. How long do you think Backe will stay? No one has ever mentioned that he might leave. Everyone in the kitchen wants you to take over. Some of our cooks have already started to look around for other- -after other jobs. -You also? -No, not yet, but ... Backe is in a slump right now. But it will be better. Yes. We can only hope so. -Hello. -Hello. How is she? Good. We took a walk. -What did you say about the bid? -It didn't come up. Are you sure that she had an actual hemorrhage? Yes, what do you mean? I think it seems very timely for her that it happened now. And it doesn't seem very serious if you went for a walk. Fortunately, no. Yes it is. You... Helga called. Gustaf is ready to sell to you. Then Winter must have pulled out. That's good, isn't it? Yes, that's great. This one I'm in line for now. "Two rooms and a kitchen, nicely laid out. 51 square meters. " "Perfect for a small family." In Vällingby ... -What was it like meeting Gunnar? -All right.  Tomorrow we'll see each other again. - Did he say anything about ... -No, we didn't talk about you. Sorry, but I just have to say ... I'm a little worried. Suddenly Gunnar appears and wants to be your father -and you don't even know each other. -Should he take over now? -Take over? He's leaving the day after tomorrow. I don't know. He's my dad, and I want to know who he is. Yes, of course. The only thing he said about you was ... ... that I could never have had a better mother. Yes... Read your book now. I have received a good offer from Henriette Winter. I understand that you are having a hard time with the idea of having her as a co-owner. -and I want this clarified ASAP. -Gustaf, we can't try ... -No, Mom. I'm ready to listen to your bid. I have prepared an agreement, so we can settle this right away. This is far below Henriette's offer. That is a reasonable valuation of your part. No, Peter. No. I got the impression that you wanted to conclude this quickly. This is what we can offer. Damn you, Mom. Damn you. Gustaf.
