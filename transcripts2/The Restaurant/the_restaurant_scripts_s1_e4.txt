 Let go! Your brother was here yesterday. He started talking about the coupons. -He must have found them. -He can not prove shit. How could you pay SEK 50,000? You have borrowed them from Ragnarsson, who provides you with coupons! Given what you owe me, I basically own the restaurant. What happened yesterday ... Everything is so complicated now. I'll bring my son home soon, But I like you. I do not understand why you still have contact with a thief. I might like her. Hi.

 I know you have visits at night. You play roulette with your future. Nina? Nina! Erlingsen Hot Six plays tonight! -No, seriously ? Fantastic! - Do you know who they are? They are reminiscent of Erlingsen Hot Five. How do you manage? - He's the Nordic region's best trumpeter. It's getting crowded. Maybe we could go there and celebrate? -What are you going to celebrate? -Well ... -Have you got engaged? - Didn't we say that? I did not notice anything! I've been showing it all along! Sorry. I'm just so happy for you.

 How brave you are. How do you know when it's right? -Have you told Mom? -No. -When were you going to do that? -Not today. Now I want to be happy. -When did you last speak? -On the anniversary. -Don't say anything about this. -As you wish. But someday you have to talk. Want to hear some gossip? Not all herrings need gossip. It is said that Miss Löwander has a secret lover. -Where did you hear that? -Karl-Åke's girl lives in the same house. She saw Nina at night with company. Do they know what he looks like? He is 1.80M tall, curly hair, blue eyes ... Gorgeous, he should be. I'm kidding with you! Nobody knows who it is. -What you blush! -I blush for your sake. KNOCK -Helga:Nina! -Yes! -Can I come in? -A moment! I'm coming! -Why did you lock up? -Because I was changing. -What have you done? - Eaten at Peter's. -How is he? -Call and ask yourself. -And the dexterous woman ...? -Suzanne. She still lives there. You look tired. It is too many late nights for you. Go out now, so I can change. I'll help you with that. But this is not possible. -Have you put on a little? -No, it has always been too small! -Stop snooping! -What a mood! -It's not your time of the month, is it? -Out! Two tournedos. -Quisling is a great man! -I do not doubt that. He did everything for the Norwegian nation, and then he is sentenced to death! August disapproves of the dissolution of the union. In truth, Löwander! In a hundred years, his detractors will be forgotten? -and Quisling's name will be world famous. -Herrn! Should I get the cellar master? -No. We're only going to the party room. Roos does not have to say that we are here. Wow, what a lot of people! -Are you having a good time? -Yes! And it will get better! Now they're here, our first international booking. The band all jazz lovers in the Nordics talks about: Erlingsen Hot Six! -Hello! It makes me happy to see you! -There are so many people! It is fantastic. Come on, let's celebrate! -Tell me about your future plans. -We'm getting married, of course. Then we'll probably move to New York. There is talk of an organization that will prevent war. I want to work there. -Or Paris. -Who does not want to live there? -What are you going to do, Nina? -I want to open a club - DK Club. - A bit like La Coupole in Paris. -Have you been there? - You never told me that. - There's much I haven't told you. - Do you hear? - Sure, I'm not deaf. -Now? -Do you want to twiddle your thumbs even more? -Good, these Erlandson. What is their group called? -Hot Five, or how was it? -Peter. -Hello. Why did I not hear from you? I've been busy with other things. -But you do have time to dance? -Yes. We're celebrating a little, Mom. Suzanne and I are engaged. Mother. Mother! -Excuse her. -It must be a shock. It is completely indefensible! I'm getting champagne. Forget this. I have to go and talk to her. You need to come now and toast my future wife. - Act like a civilized person! - This coming from you! - Did you think of telling me that you were getting engaged? -I guessed how you would react. -You are going to marry a thief. Enough of this! Sorry if I do not announce the engagement with a newspaper ad. You don't know what he's been through! No, and neither do you! I love her! She's taking you for the money, can't you see that? She has nothing. Stop being such a fucking bitch! Get out of here! Out! -Do you want to see your children happy? -It's all I want. No. It does not matter, as long as you get to decide. It's not true! If you don't toast Suzanne, I will never come back. They have the gall to celebrate their engagement in secret! It's their engagement. They get to choose. Excuse me, but I can't bring myself to offer any sincere congratulations. From kitchen to future wife within a few weeks. You know nothing about me, and not much about your brother either. More than you, little friend. I promise. Källarmästarn! So pleasant! Here we have two elegant ladies. -Ragnarsson. -Nina Löwander. And who do we have here? Ragnarsson. Suzanne Goldstein. Goldstein? So exotic! - Are you from the continent? -France. -Fantastic! I love France! -Curt. -Did anyone die? -No, we're celebrating an engagement. I'm sorry! A bachelor has left us in the flower of his age! You're bothering us! Go, or be thrown out. Come with me. -Are you not a cellar master? -I offer a grog. Is it the little sister who has the pants in the family? Peter! You are engaged to the Jew! "Mazel tov!" -Let's go. -No, Ragnarsson will go. -It's not up to you to decide. -The hell it's not. Get out! I can get a job for your fiancée. It's well paid. I would not touch you with forceps. -Peter! -Peter, stop now! Peter! God damnit! What the hell are you arresting me for? He's the one who jumped on me! Quiet! -What the hell! -Go right in here. Peter and Ragnarsson will be questioned. If Peter blabs about the coupons, the whole restaurant will be implicated, including me. Hell! - Will Peter be detained all night? - I don't know, and I don't care. We have a hundred problems that are bigger. -So you want to report Mr. Ragnarsson? -Yes. He harassed my fiancée, grossly. Words against words. Ragnarsson has made a counter-notification of abuse. He was the one who beat me. -He claims he was attacked. - Are you taking the word of a criminal gangster? "Criminal"? What more do you know about Mr Ragnarsson? I do not know anything. I heard it was wild. The police sent everyone home. I'm sorry. -I don't know if I can open again. -Yes! People often fight at dance venues. The engagement party was completely ruined. -But it's not your fault, is it? -It feels so. -How are things? How are you? -I'm just so terribly tired. I can do nothing. - Weren't you at the doctor's? -Yes. What did he say then? He said I'm overworked and need to rest. You should listen to him. Go to sleep. I'll take care of this mess. Do you want to come up to me later? I would like nothing better, but we haven't been careful enough. -What do you mean? - There are rumors. -About us? They saw someone with you late at night. I'm terribly tired of sneaking around. Me too. See you tomorrow? Go home and go to bed now. -Sit still! -Gently! Hope they lock up Ragnarsson and throws away the key. You can't attack everyone who is rude to me. -I've been through worse. -Just so. I love you. I love you. So you've been to La Coupole, you? I wish I'd known you before the war. What was your life like then? It does not matter. Only the future matters. Okay. What time is it? Who is the father? What? Fatigue, mood swings and a pile of unused absorbents. I know when your time of the month is, and it's long overdue. Nina! -How late are you? -Only a few weeks. Is it someone I know? No. - Does he know? -No, I haven't had time to tell him. Then you make sure to do it right away. Then we'll meet his parents and figure out the best way to solve this problem. It will be a civil marriage. And hopefully, people will have a hard time counting. -Please! -A wedding is the only alternative. Are you going to welcome him as warmly as you did Suzanne? You talk to him first, and then we'll meet withhis parents this weekend. -He looks like a good boy. -Yes, he really is. -Do you think you'll need me every night? -I do not know. Working hours vary. If it's late, I'll pay extra. It's not necessary. Such a little boy is not awake for long. I get time off, so the first few days I'll be at home with him. First get your son, then we'll arrange the rest later. -How do I look? -Like a little aunt. -Thanks... -You look trustworthy. -Seriously, do I look like an aunt? -No, I was kidding! You look like a mom. Hey, Uno! How big you've gotten! Does mom get a hug? I've missed you. Look what I have. -Uno, what do you say? -Thanks. You are welcome. It's for you. I came across some real coffee. They say that rationing will end soon. We shall see. I've set the table in the garden. Come sit down. We're trying the ball! He's a little shy at first. -Everything OK? You're so quiet. -I'm just thinking. -About what? -About the future. - You never do that? -Yes. -What do you think about your future? -I told you that when we first met. Tell me again. Okay. I want to be as good as Backe, and own a place like Djurgårdskällaren. -And more? -And be married to the most beautiful young woman in the world. -No children? -Yes, three or four.. And when do you see yourself with children?. Well into the future. Not right now. -And you? Do you want children? -I think so. I don't know. I must go. I promised mom and Lennart to cook for them. -Come with me! -Home with you? I want you to meet my family. Come on! Källarmästarn! Ragnarsson is still in custody. -Did the police ask about our business? -I said nothing. Ragnarsson is more worried about your brother. Peter? He won't say anything. If you don't take care of him then we'll have to do it ourselves. We'll need to leave now so we're not late for the train. I'll go get his stuff. Now we are going by train to Stockholm. Do you like to travel by train? Mr. Fransson is right on top. He's the rabbit. He likes to hear "Byssan Lull". Now be a kind, good boy. I don't want to travel by train. Uno, go with your mom now. Show me that you are a big, brave boy. You! Come now. Why must he go? He is fine here. He's my son, and he will be with me. I hope you do what's best for Uno. Come on, Uno. Come with mom. -You smell good. -Thanks. -Sometimes Calle also smells good like that. -Well, he does? Calle can conjure up fantastic flavors from simple ingredients. Simple ingredients are all we can afford. -Are you in pain? -About as usual. I did not want to intrude. -What grade are you in? -Second. We have a lot of homework. Can I help you with that later? It's probably going to be a bit crowded. Maybe we can sit in there? -It's a closet. -Sorry. No, god. You could not know that. Miss probably wonders how we sleep. Calle sleeps in the bed, and we on the couch. Now the miss has learned something new. You were rude! She was embarrassed by the closet. People like that are never ashamed. Ask me before you invite someone home! I'm in pain, so I'm not happy about having visitors. You and that girl will never be serious! She's just having fun with you! -You don't know Nina! -Have you met her family? We have to talk. Drop the complaint against Ragnarsson; otherwise we may have to close the restaurant. It wouldn't be my fault. You've done business with Ragnarsson. Yes, but now it's about the survival of the restaurant! You have no idea what they are capable of. You can get hurt. I'm not saying anything untrue; we may eventually end up in court... ...and I would be under oath and would risk my law career by repeating a lie? Never. -Peter, I'm asking ... -Slutdiskuterat! Byssan lull, boil the kettle ... Uno, you have to sleep. -I want to go to mom. -Mom is here. It's getting late. You have to sleep now. So. I want to go home. Shall we read a fairy tale? Uno! You can lie there. -Have you talked to Dad? -I couldn't. -He must take responsibility. -I can't marry him. Then we have to find another solution. You can stay with cousin Märy in Småland. -For how long? -Until the baby is born. We find a family that can take it. -What happens to my jazz nights then? -We use the party floor as before. -The fight did not affect the party floor! -No, but we've decided. After the baby is born, you will go to home-economics school. -There is no other alternative. -Yes, there is. No, Nina. It does not exist. -Löwander. -Hi, it's me. This is the only phone call I'm  entitled to. The police are listening. Anders talked to you yesterday about any deliveries. He mailed you the leaflets yesterday. - Did you get them? -Yes, I think so. Yes. Look closely at them now, and you will understand Anders' message even better. Good thing you came, Peter. -I'm worried about Gustaf. -I understand. - What do you understand? - Gustaf has sent you to talk to me. Yes, but I also feel that some very hard words flew the other night. - Unnecessarily hard. -Yes. If you blab to the police, Ragnarsson will drag Gustaf down with him. -I can't lie in an interrogation! -No, but you can tell less than the whole truth. We have different opinions but we must put them aside for now. The family must stick together. When it blows hard, stiking together is especially important. -Do you hear how you sound? -What? I got engaged to the one I love, and you refused to toast her. Tell me what you want me to do. Hi. This is my mother - Helga. - Helga, this is Suzanne. -Helga Löwander. -Suzanne Goldstein. May I invite you to our home for a cup of tea? Thanks! Biggan's man is a pilot. He flies with AB Aerotransport in London. These stockings come from there. -They are gorgeous! -Maybe not as beautiful as silk. They are so durable! They can last for ten years, they say. -Should Biggan arrange a pair for you? -Certainly. What is it? is it true that Elin, that she ... ...was pregnant and miscarried? No! -Do you know where one would go...? -You can't go there! What should I do then? It's not possible. Not now. There are other places. I've heard of a doctor. He's said to be very skilled. And discreet. Do not worry. You have to eat something. Do you want a little more apple sauce? Now you take this. So! Uno, now that's enough! Sit here until you're ready to behave! Sorry! Forgive me, Sweetie. Hello? Hey! Are you eating? -What do you want? -I wanted to say hello. Can I come in? Hey, Uno! My name is Lilly. I'm a friend of your mom. -How is it going? -Not at all. He cries all the time. I've barely slept. Did I do the right thing? I'm probably not cut out to be a mother. Give me a break! Are you giving up after ONE night? He longs for his foster mother. What did you expect? Kids scream, that's it. I want you to go now. Maggie ... Yes! -I wanted to see how you were. -Now you know! I want to make a national call. Nyköping 519 30. Thanks. 519 30. Hello? Who is it? I want to apologize for Mom. She's in pain. She gets tired of it, and it puts her in a bad mood. It's very obvious how much your little brother Lennart admires you. -You will be a good dad one day. -I hope so. -Is everything good? -Yes, I'm just a little tired. I'm going out to the archipelago for a few days. -Hello! I have to go down to the kitchen. -Sorry. -You, how are you? -There is really no danger. Go now. What can I do to help Miss? I know you're able to help women in particular situations.  -Yes. How far along are you? -I'm a few weeks ago with ... I understand. It's early, it's good. -How does it work in practice? -We book an appointment for an examination. We carry out the procedure, you rest a few hours and then you're able to go home. -Is there a risk that I will become sterile? -No, the risks are very small. It's a simple procedure for a doctor with training and experience. -Then I would like to book an appointment. -Then we'll arrange it. -Can you come on Monday at eleven o'clock? -Yes, that'll be good. The price is SEK 1,600. -1 600 kronor? -Yes, that's right. -Can the fiancé help with that? -No. Sometimes parents can help. -Do you want more? - "No, thank you." -What a beautiful piano. -My mother-in-law was very musical. It's just Nina in our family who has inherited that ability. Can't you play a little? -May I? -By all means! Helga Löwander. No, he's not here. What are you saying?! One moment, Astrid. - Have you seen Gustaf today? -No. He didn't come home last night. -Has Gustaf been here today? -No. - Do you know where he can be? -Not really. What "really"? Peter! I need to talk with you! It is important. I have to borrow some money. -How much? -1 600. -1 600 ?! -I know it's a lot. -What are you going to use it for? -I can 't say that right now. I do not have that much money. -Do you think Gustaf has it? - He's gone. -How did it go? -He cried just a little for his mother. Mother! Mom is here, Sweetie. Mom is here. So... -Can you borrow from someone else? -Not 1,600. My hundred is not much help. Perhaps. -There are cheaper alternatives. -No! It is a very simple procedure. -Many do it. -And some die! You can die from giving birth too. I have to do this. I must. Agnes ... Do you know where Elin went? Please. "... and happy in their forest." "Of berries and mushrooms and nuts, they have more than enough. " I'm coming. - I'm coming soon. -Hello. -Hello! I just wanted to say sorry for last time. I don't know what you're going through. But you were right. He needed more time. I won't intrude. Get in touch if you want to get together. Don't you want to hear the fairy tales too? Yes, but I don't think I get to. Why not? You get to if you want. "And father is strong and courageous, and mother is gentle and kind "- - "and cheerful playmates in all the places they have. " "When storm and rain reign in the outside world "- - "here in the woods it does nothing at all. " -Did you talk to Gustaf today? -No. - He's gone. -He's probably recovering. There will be nothing with Småland. -Has he agreed to get married? -No, I just got my monthly. -Finally some good news! -Yes. Good thing I did not get hold of Märy. -I'm going to Rindö tomorrow. -Yes. Do it, Dear. This was a warning for the future. "Mon dieu!" -No danger... -Silent! Come to the couch. I do not want you to see me like this! My life is over! The sun will probably rise tomorrow as well. What...? What the hell is this? When I get drunk is there a side of me ... I am sick. I'm not healthy. -Who has the negative? -Ragnarsson. I ran into him at a brothel he runs. I did not know it was his. Fucking pigs! Fucking pigs ... What does he want? That you withdraw the complaint! Otherwise he goes to the newspapers and to Astrid. I beg you, Peter. I'm not a good big brother, but it's not so easy being your brother. Nothing I do is good enough. I'm been mad at you, but it's not your fault. If there's a scandal and I end up in jail, I lose everything. I'm wouldn't be allowed to see my children anymore. My children! -Löwander! What are you doing here? -I want to withdraw my complaint. -I said things in anger. Never mind, we've already investigated. We have enough evidence, but I understand your dilemma. What are you referring to? We have found evidence against several large restaurants. Djurgårdskällaren is one of them. Gustaf has been arrested, but our lawyer is working to get him released as soon as possible. Until then, we have to see to Djurgårdskällaren's best. We have appointed a new cellar master. -Who is it? -You. Me? Ever since Djurgårdskällaren opened in 1911 we have had a  Löwander in the dining room. -I have to think this through. -After which your answer must be "yes." It's a girl I know; I'm worried about her. Why? She used to be happy. Now she's tired, hungover, pensive and nauseous. She's been to the doctor. -Calle ... What have you done? -What? She's not sick. She is with child.
