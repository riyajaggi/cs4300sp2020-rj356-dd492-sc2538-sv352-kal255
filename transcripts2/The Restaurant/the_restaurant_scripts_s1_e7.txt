 -There are too few guests. -Make a bistro! We should do something about the mood. -What are you going to do, Nina? -I want to open a club here. No no! Stop, everyone! Immediately! Peter and Nina will test their ideas. In his mother's eyes, Peter is flawless. She has accepted Suzanne! It's not possible! I came here to see you. -Do you still want to go to the movies? -It's done! He's not my fiancé. -There will be a deduction from the salary. -Madness!

 I come from the union. - This is Maggan from Djurgårdskällaren. Congratulations on your success. Only Suzanne was missing. Be careful not to let anyone steal her from you. What does he know? Does he know me? Or Sarah and Jerome? I need you. -We do it every year. -We're coming! We call it a delayed engagement party. The parties at Nina's summer house are legendary. Anything can happen. -Alarming! -Don't listen to him. I forgot to tell Stickan how many we are. I'll do it now. I'll be back soon! Hey! Have a nice evening! -The orchestra must calm down! -They can hardly be heard! - Was the food to your liking, Minister? - Yes of course. -How long does the orchestra play? -Too long.

 My young friends want to have time to dance. - Minister Erlander! -Good evening. Peter Löwander runs the restaurant. -He arranged a table at short notice. - We can always squeeze in the Minister. -She's really good. -Thanks. She's my future wife. -Would you look at that. Congratulations! -Thanks. Gustaf, are you taking it? Have a nice evening. There will be 25 people? Yes, if that's okay. -Do you want strawberry cake? -Gladly. I'll arrange it with Ethel. My fish chef Calle agrees with this menu. He's good at crayfish and herring. He'll go with you to the summer house and see that everything goes smoothly. - Will that be okay, Miss Nina? -Yes. Hi. Have you received a brochure about the union? They can help you negotiate better working conditions and wages. Have you seen this, Ethel? It doesn't seem so stupid. I agree with you in principle, but the cellar master won't like it.. Not the cellar master, but his brother probably views it differently. Hope you are right. Some waiters have already joined. -Not a seat available for the whole evening. -Like music to my ears! -The club was also full. -It sounded like it. Next week I'm going to Gothenburg and check out a rotisserie. -Why? -It might be something we'd like to use. -Where in the kitchen would it fit? -We shouldn't have it in the kitchen. -We'll have it in the dining room. -In here? - So has Eggers and Riche. It's like a show for the guests. We'll talk about this when you come back from Gothenburg. Good evening! It will stink of chickens in here! I'll see how Eggers has done it. They probably have a fan. We'll put it there with an exhaust fan behind it. And we put tarps on the customers so they don't get dirty. Brilliant. Tage Erlander comments that you play great. -Thanks. Who is he? -Only a government minister. -Thanks for tonight. -Thanks. Do you remember the man Miss Goldstein met? Find out where he lives and works. -How should I find him? -That's your problem. No! Your turn. -Then it was ready, I think. -Thanks. -What do I owe? -Nothing. -Stop now. -You help me all the time. But something for the trouble? Sonja, it's useless arguing with her. Then I have to thank you so much. -I have to go now. -I won! - Me too. Thanks for the coffee and ... - It's nothing.. -Bye  then, Lelle! -Bye. -How nice she is, your mother. -You bring out the best in her. I'm not sure ... The gray. I would like a smaller one of that. I'm going to meet Ebba Rehnskiöld and talk about the wedding. My wedding? Maybe she knows more than I do. You have not told me anything. -There is a date? -Has it been discussed? It's a bit fluid. Fine. You should have started your planning already this spring. What luck that you have planned my wedding ever since i was born ... There has been a lot at the club, and Erik has been busy at work. We haven't talked about the details yet. Nice. But it will be at Church with reception in the ballroom, right? I guess so. I'll take twelve of them, please. Then I can calm Ebba, your future mother. She's probably starting to get nervous. We at Djurgårdskällaren always have taken good care of our staff. If anyone has had a problem I've always dealt with it at once. Therefore, I am very disappointed when I find this kind of thing in the restaurant. Communist Propaganda! Which of you is spreading this? It's me, cellar master. Have any others joined the union? Up with your hands! The right to join the union is protected by law. Come with me to my office. The rest of you can return to work. -You'll not get away with this. -Workers are allowed to join a union. At this restaurant the union has nothing to do. -If the cellar master only ... -Silent! - We should not have this communist shit here! -I'm not a communist. -Yes! -You do not have to be unpleasant. There is no nice way to say this: you are fired! You can't do that, cellar master. -Yes, I can do that. -Your brother probably does not agree. -Peter is gone. Also, this is a personnel matter, and he has nothing to do with personnel matters. So! Do I have to throw you out? Maggie! Maggan, what did he say? I got fired. You have the right on your side. We will help you get your job back. I have brought in new members. Now you can stand up for me. - Has anyone else been fired? - Not that I know of. Only one other admitted joining. We're both scared. I'm contacting Löwander tomorrow, and will set up a meeting. Take this one too? - Aren't you Calle? How are you? - All right. -Calle is the kitchen boy who likes jazz. -I'm a cook now. Oh I'm sorry. I saw you lugging the food and assumed you were still a kitchen boy. -Pleasant evening. -Put the bag in the hall! They have not planned any details, but the youth today are like that. There is no need to worry. Everything will turn out good. Thanks! - No, I'm not worried. The wedding will be in Oscarskyrkan Church and dinner at Djurgårdskällaren. Then I think there's a little misunderstanding. Oh really? Everyone in our family has been married in our castle chapel in Skåne. -A castle chapel? -Yes, at Graveholm Castle. A cookie? We have the wedding dinner in the castle. It's very practical! -All guests can stay in ONE wing. -This is news to me. We take the chefs from Savoy. Absolutely top quality! The menu is almost ready. Nina has not said anything about this. It's a tradition in our family since the 1600s, and we aren't going to change it now. - How conceited that woman is! They have so many traditions that no, no, no ... They can't be changed! She can't have dinner here, because "it's a dance restaurant"! The wedding will be at her castle, with top-quality Savoy chefs! That Ebba Rehnskiöld is not as nice as she wants to seem. She married into nobility. Know where the baron found her? In the ballet at Berns! -Is that right? -It was a big scandal at the time. - Do you have a moment? -I'm not so good with Swedish. Shall I call the manager? Do you speak German? No, French. Do you know Suzanne Goldstein? Who are you? - Gustaf Löwander. I do not believe that it concerns you who I know. Suzanne is my brother's fiancé. - Yes. You hang out with her. Why? - No, that is not true. We haven't seen each other for a long time. Are you having an affair with her? - No absolutely not. What is your relationship? Why do you see her? - Suzanne is my wife. I do not believe that. - It's the truth. She's engaged to my brother. - We got married before the war. We got separated in a concentration camp. She thought I was dead. Does't my brother know? - No. I don't want to bother him with it. We're getting a divorce. I'm staying in the background now. Please say nothing to your brother. Not for me, but for Suzanne. Thank you for your honesty. 90 84 63. - It's me. Philippe. How are you? - You promised to leave me alone. Peter's brother came to see me. - Gustaf? Why? He knows we've seen each other. How does he know that? - No idea. I asked him to say nothing to Peter. What did he want? - Nothing. He just left. Suzanne, I'm sorry. Thanks so much. Think again about where the wedding and reception dinner should be. Djurgården cellar is not as bad as you think. -Would you like to taste something from our kitchen? -I won't change my mind. Then the young people must decide for themselves, and we should respect their decision. Yes, if they follow our family traditions. -Now you're a little irrational. -It's about the family's reputation. But then Djurgårdskällaren should fit very well. -What do you mean? -It's a dance restaurant. -You have experience from such, don't you? -Now I do not understand at all. -I know your background. -I grew up on Graveholm. -You also danced at Berns when you were young. -Absolutely not! So you have not danced cancan and showed your butt to half of Stockholm? It was a small bird that told me that. And what kind of bird was that? who croaked, if I may ask? Tell that little bird that I intend to sue for defamation. Good evening. She denied everything. She can deny it, but it's the truth. She's lied about it until she believes it herself. -Ebba Rehn ... stage name?. -Yes. Rehnskiöld, or was it Renstierna? Her old name was Magnus? No - Wilhelm! No, Magnus Renstierna married a dancer. Damned if she's not named Ebba too. Ebb. Ebba Renstierna. No, hey! Her name was Ellen! Ellen Renstierna. At a staff meeting, Mr. Löwander showed a union brochure ... -and expressed his disapproval. cellar MASTER Löwander spoke in general terms. We have freedom of speech here in Sweden. Miss Nilsson was then fired due to her union involvement. No. The cellar master said he did not want "communist shit" here. I find that unlikely. We demand Miss Nilsson's immediate re-employment. She was not fired due to her union involvement. - She has been negligent at her work. - That is not true. Colleagues talk about late arrivals, early departure and carelessness. That's pure fabrication! I got fired for recruiting members to the union! The basis for the dismissal is different, as the lawyer said. Many attest that it is because of Miss Nilsson's union involvement. Only the Director knows why He called Miss Nilsson into his office. -And Miss Nilsson. -Words against words. The cellar master is lying. We all know that. -Several others are also union members. -Not several. A single person. She has not faced any retaliation. Thus, Miss Nilsson was not fired due to her union involvement. -They are lying! -Quiet. They have to say something like that. -I have not misbehaved! -No, these are unfounded accusations. We'll shoot them to pieces. Good work, really great! Did you see the look on her face? -Can I suggest one thing? -Yes. This is a good opportunity to propose a settlement. It was hard to find any complaints about Miss Nilsson. We will have problems. -Are you really that easily intimidated? -You can lose in this battle. -Think how we should win. -It is a matter of principle for the union. For me too. She's not getting her job back. I do what is required. - Is this where you're hiding? -Hello. -Hello. Welcome home. -Thanks. -What are you talking about? -Nothing important. We were just done. -How was Gothenburg? -Good. I have some drawings with me. Hotel Eggers is very happy with their rotisserie. They have a fan, so they have no problems at all with odor in the dining room. We'll need to increase chicken deliveries. Talk to Ragnarsson's boys about it. - We always get them from Börje Jonsson. - Ragnarsson will handle larger amounts. -Oh really? -We're obligated until our debt is paid off. -Imagine that you shop with Ragnarsson. -I had to. And an agreement is an agreement. You, Peter ... I need to talk to you about one thing. This is not an easy conversation. I have been told that Suzanne has not been honest with you. -What do you mean? -She's meeting another man. -What are you trying to do? -It's true. -Who says that? -Someone who has seen them together. - Do you mean that Suzanne meets someone? -He claims that Suzanne is his wife. -Was it good? Shall we thank the kitchen? -Yes! Well then. The kitchen to the table, the kitchen to the table- the kitchen to the table, the kitchen to the table, the kitchen to the table ... Because it was in the most beautiful spring of our youth we drank and toasted together and all so we now drink the kitchen to and the kitchen does not say no to that Salud! Because it was in the most beautiful spring of our youth we drank to each other and we said salud. Wait! I want everyone to hear this. Nina. From the first day that I met you I fell in love with you ... ... so I've been thinking about which wine describes you best. You have the charm of a Gewürztraminer. A perfect balance between sweetness and acidity. Your lips are like a beaujolais with the aroma of strawberry. Stop, I'm thirsty! Your legs ... What should I compare them to? Elegant as a Sancerre, well turned as a Chablis of good vintage. But the drink that catches your essence, perfect being like no other. Effervescent, playful, luxurious and complex. Champagne, of course. Nina, who would I be without you? I love you so much. I'm the happiest man in the world. We're getting married this fall! You are late. Was there a stop on the train? No, I walked past the restaurant. You... Have you talked to Gustaf? Yes. Is it true? Yes. It's true. -What's his name? -Philippe. And he's your husband? We got married before the war. I swear, I thought he was dead. I should have told you. I could not. Sorry. Peter, forgive me. I love you. You are everything to me! -You wanted to talk to me. -Sit down. It's about Miss Nilsson. She's trying to be reinstated. Do you have any information about her? I told Lawyer Lager everything. -Nothing more? -Margareta is a good waitress. -No rumors? -I prefer not to ... You got a second chance after the license issue. -I know. I'm thankful. -Then it's time to show it! I have the feeling there's something you're not saying. There is a rumor. -Hello! -Hello. Thanks for tonight. The crayfish were amazing. Thanks. And the cake! I'm stuffed. I'll relay your compliments to Sonja. So were you ready for tonight? No, there is a snack at 1:00 AM. Then we'll return on the same boat. Yes exactly. -I'll continue to pack up here. -Yes, do not let me disturb you. -Have a nice evening. -You too. Good evening. Miss should call this number as soon as possible. -Should I call this late? -Yes. Thanks. -Löwander. -It's Margareta Nilsson. I regret this dispute has become so heated. -A lot of the responsibility falls on me. -I agree with that. Can we meet tomorrow, and talk about it calmly and sensibly? I get to notify my union contact. It's better if you come alone. Just hear what I have to say. We can probably put this behind us. -What time had you been thinking? -Ten O'Clock. -It will be fine. Good evening. -Good evening. Splinter may be a bastard, but if you work hard you can be rewarded. You learn a lot from someone like Stickan. -Hi, kitchen boys! -Fuck him. -What did you say? -Nothing. - We are hungry! Food? - It's at one o'clock. -I'm hungry now. -We're on a break. The break is over. Start working. What the hell are you doing? Here's your damn snack! Now I'll bust you! - What are you doing? Stop! Are you crazy? - This idiot started it. Are you fighting at our engagement party ?! -It was not Erik's fault. -Silent! I never want to see you again! The cook was hitting Sture. I merely tried to break it up. You hit someone who was lying down. Do you feel brave? Is there something between you and the chef? Maybe what they say is true, that you are promiscuous. Let me go. He's bleeding in the head. We have a first aid kit here. Agnes, you can go out to the others. Hold that. Ouch... It was worth it? You're here with me now. Have you seen Nina? Have you seen Nina? Nina! Nina! Nina! -Agnes. -What are you doing? Everyone is looking for you! The boat will return to town soon. I'm not going. You have to! No. I will stay here. - What should I say to Erik? - Tell him I'm fine and I'll call him tomorrow. Don't do it, Nina. You may regret it tomorrow. Tell everyone that I'm fine. Okay. - I thought you wouldn't come back. - I have to ask you something. Is it because of Philippe that you've cancelled our wedding date? No. You seemed happy to be engaged. Yes, but just being engaged was not enough. I wanted your family to accept me first. -Did you plan to be married to two? -No. I've filed for divorce, but it must be done in France. It will take time. Don't leave me again. Nina. Yes, I'm alone here. I don't know. Tonight, maybe. I need to think a little. We'll talk more tonight, Mom. Come in. -Director. -Come in. Have a seat. What did you want? Yes ... Tell me. Why do you think you're here? - Well, you called me. - Exactly. -I want to put this behind us. -Yes, I want that too. It's entirely up to you. I'll go straight to the point. I know that you have a relationship with a woman. -It's not true. -You kissed in the locker room. I think the child welfare board would find that information interesting. A single woman without a job who lives a perverted life. -That's a lie! -A sexually perverted life. As you know, homosexuality is a mental illness in the eyes of the authorities. You would lose custody of your son, Uno. - It has nothing to do with work! - Well, actually yes, it does. If you demand to return to work, I will inform the child welfare board about this. It's really in your interest to put this behind you. This is how life should be. If I could be with you and run my club, I would be happy. Then I would have everything I want. Erik, then? I don't love him. And you? What do you want out of life? You. -But you have a girlfriend, don't you? Sonja? -Sonja is a wonderful girl. I'm waiting for a "but". I love only you. What if we could go to New York, go to restaurants and clubs -and get inspiration. -It sounds like a dream. -We can do it. It's our time now. Yours and mine. Yours and mine. Stay far away from Suzanne! How did you find out about this? -I heard something strange somewhere. - Did you spy on her? Welcome. Jérome? Sarah? It's you. What do you want? I've missed you so much. He's scared! Jérome. It's me. Miss Goldstein, you need to step back. Let me go! Come to Mama. Come here! -You're trying to reach me! -Mr Löwander, Suzanne is not feeling well. My children. Jerome, Sarah, it's me! Suzanne, darling! Hello! Darling! Come here, I beg you. Quiet now, Suzanne. I'm very sorry. We'll make this up to you. I'm very sorry. Hi. What has happened? -Where is Mom? -She has had a heart attack. What? Is she in the hospital? Calle ... She's dead.
