 The Blue Planet (2001): Season 1, Episode 7 - Tidal Seas - full transcript 
 Tidal marshes are one of the most productive parts of the world. Numerous plants support numerous animals, yet life is not easy: predators are attracted to these enormous quantities of food, forcing animals to seek constant protection from attack.

 There is a force sufficiently powerful to move the oceans of this world It is a force, not of this earth The moon is large enough to generate gravity and with sufficient force to pull on the earth, two hundred and thirty thousand miles away As the moon orbits the earth its gravity sweeps across the face of our planet Its power drags a great bulge of oceanic water in its wake - the rising tide The River Amazon in Brazil On some special days the gravitational forces of the moon and the sun pull together - to extraordinary effect

 A growing tidal wave from the ocean is being forced two hundred miles inland This is a tidal bore Fortunately tidal bores are rare, but the moon does create strong tides out in the world's oceans, on every day of the year The Bay of Fundy, in Nova Scotia The tides here are the largest in the world and have a profound effect on marine life, creating a rich feeding ground A feast that attracts some of the largest diners on the planet Humpback whales But they are not the biggest threat to the herring These are finback whales At seventy tonnes - the second largest animal on earth, but so beautifully streamlined that it is the fastest of the great whales

 This combination of speed and immense size makes the finback a voracious hunter of schooling fish The Bay of Fundy can attract so many fish, that during the summer, as many as five hundred of these magnificent whales hunt here every day The feeding is best where the tides run strongly So the whales move further into the bay, following tidal rips and searching for fish Their movements are closely watched by flocks of Cory Shearwaters As the whales dive down toward the fish - more and more birds gather, anxious to pick up scraps The flowing tide may provide a feast for the whales, but before long it will turn In just six hours, one hundred billion tonnes of water will flow out of the bay The sea level falling by as much as 15 metres and exposing vast tracts of mud... and sand At first sight a barren place, entirely devoid of life In fact, the damp sand is packed with microscopic life - the meiofauna, feeding in a sandy underworld, quite unaffected by the departure of the sea But life is not all roses in this miniature world A sand bubbler crab - in Northern Australia - it hunts meiofauna Just a centimetre across, the sand bubbler works at breakneck speed, passing sand grains into its mouth, filtering out all the meiofauna and kicking aside the waste The crab will clean every grain of sand within a metre of its burrow Endless practise for the best back heel in the Natural World The crabs work fast because they can only sieve when the sand is damp Remarkably, they work the entire surface of the beach within just a couple of hours of the tide retreating Then they simply return to their burrows and await the next tide Underwater a falling tide is the cue for some bizarre activity These slow moving clams use their muscular feet to bury themselves under the sand If they fail to get under cover, the tide will leave them exposed to the air and they will perish But once underground they can wait deep down in the sand, safe beneath the beach And not a moment too soon June in Southeast Alaska and in just four hours a vast sandy beach is exposed by the falling tide The bears are hungry - at this time of year the pickings on land are few and far between But any food here has long since buried itself deep under the sand To a hungry adult bear that is no barrier - they smell the clams through the sand and simply dig them out For such large animals, they show quite extraordinary dexterity at opening the unfortunate shellfish Cubs try their luck, too, none too successfully! But for the adults the shellfish feast lasts as long as the tide remains out Table Mountain in South Africa Every day the retreating waves leave flotsam somewhere on the beach... ...and this creature is scenting the currents for the odour of rotting fish The tide carries the scent far into the surf zone Responding to the smell, snails emerge from the sand This is a race against the tide - the snails need to find their meal before the tide leaves it beyond their reach But snails are slow and the tides fall rapidly These, however, are no ordinary snails They can surf! They ride the waves up the beach but all too soon the tide leaves the fish beyond the surf zone Without the sea there's a danger that the snails will lose the scent, but as long as the sand remains damp they can still follow a faint trail to the food Once there they tuck in with macabre relish Good things come to those who wait! Before long the heat of the sun forces them to retreat into the sand to await the return of the next tide February in Britain The falling tide is eagerly awaited by these knot As the water retreats countless small invertebrates are seeking shelter under the mud And with good reason Waders are specialists at probing in the mud, their wide variety of beak shapes designed for reaching different invertebrate dinners Keys that unlock the safety of the tidal flats But within a few hours the tide will turn again Soon the waders are out of their depth and the creatures of the mud are safe once more Underwater incoming tides can create a strong current And flounder are experts at hitching a tidal lift They are shaped rather like a kite - a perfect design for gliding on the tide In Newfoundland on the East Coast of Canada, large numbers of flounder ride the currents up into the shallows They have come to hunt invertebrates that will emerge now that the water is back The pickings in the shallows can be very good The activity has not gone unnoticed But Ospreys can't dive deeply As long as the water is more than a meter deep, the found then will be safe Going too far inshore can be a risky business This fish buries itself completely in the sand at any sign of danger But when the tide floods in again, as long as the coast is clear - these sand lancet will re-emerge After a wait of six hours under the sand, they are desperate for food and, unlike flounder, they head out to sea They are looking for shallow open water, where the tidal currents will concentrate their food - plankton In their untold thousand they stream toward the best feeding grounds Where they simply pick up tiny planktonic creatures from the water But, if they swim too far off-shore in search of food, they risk running into large predators that live out in deeper water Dogfish - small sharks The sand lancet have strayed out of their safe depth The effect of the turning tide can be totally different on a rocky shore Here on the coast of Vancouver Island in Canada the sun bakes the exposed rock It's virtually impossible to dig underground when the sea retreats, so these mussels and barnacles are fully exposed to the heat of the sun - literally cooking in their own shells And the seaweed simply dry to a crisp It can be a wait of many hours before the water returns Throughout each month the size and strength of the tide changes The biggest tides of all happen when the gravities of the sun and moon pull in unison That happens immediately after the new moon... ...and again after the full moon These are called the spring tides They reveal vast tracts of sea bed that would normally be covered For these racoons it's a chance to look for a seafood feast A mother ventures forth with her kits With the spring tide, they've come further down the beach than smaller tides would normally allow Searching with their extraordinarily sensitive paws - they look for suitable prey With the extreme low tide they could find something special And what could be better than a red rock crab That is, if it weren't for the risk of a painful pinch With large crabs there's no substitute for experience - the mother makes an expert's catch But the kits learn fast! And for those that don't - begging is always worth a try! All too soon the returning tide will cover the racoon's table For all the invertebrates it is a welcome relief, but in rough weather they are exposed to the worst of the waves Even when there are no waves - the incoming tide can create considerable forces underwater The gaps between these small islands on the East coast of Vancouver Island channel the tidal flow As the tide keeps rising, gradually the water flows faster and soon these giant thirty metre long bull kelp plants bend to the current They are sufficiently flexible to cope without too much damage, but there are some spots where the currents are especially powerful This is the Nakwakto Rapids At the turn of the tide, water from almost seven hundred miles of coastal fjords will have to empty through a gap of less than half a mile wide Within a few minutes the current is already picking up speed, until water roars by at over seventeen miles per hour Tidal currents are not always a damaging force - here in the Poor Knight Islands of New Zealand, weak tides run through rock arches, making an ideal resting place for stingrays These rays congregate here in huge numbers every March - they've come to breed The arches funnel the current, which the rays can ride with a minimum of effort, so saving energy Nearby, out in open water, a school of two spotted desmoiselle fish are feeding on plankton and the current is perfect for sweeping their food past them Once the current starts to weaken, there is insufficient food to warrant the risks of swimming about out here in the open So the desmoiselles head off to find shelter en-masse Safety is in numbers More and more desmoiselles pour towards the cave entrances that riddle the Poor Knight's islands Safe at last - inside the cave they are far less exposed to attack from predators Thousands of desmoiselles and blue mao mao wait for the return of the current, when once again they will head out into the open to feed The moon's gravitational pull is weaker nearer to the earth's equator, so the more equatorial the location, the smaller the tides And out here in the Caribbean Sea the tidal movements are slight Even so, they are sufficient to push free swimming plankton in their path These are thimble jellyfish They swim towards the sunlight and invisible boundaries formed by the tidal motion help to herd them together, until they gather in immense swarms They put the tropical sunshine to good use - their brown colour comes from algae that live inside the jellyfish's bodies and photosynthesise energy from the sun In open water they are fairly safe, but the tide is sweeping the whole swarm gently towards the Bahamas, where hungry mouths are waiting Although the sea level does not change much - the tides are still pushing an enormous volume of water from the ocean through the small gaps between the island cays Underwater the tidal currents race past soft corals And on over the sandy banks themselves... It is an immense area of coral sand that is only just submerged at high tide This incoming tide is bringing in a fresh supply of oceanic plankton and razorfish gather at the best spots to catch the pick of the microscopic feast Although there is plenty here for these small fish to eat, gathering in one place makes it easy for their predators to find them A nurse shark is little threat But this sound heralds a quite different danger A bottlenose dolphin It's using its sonar to locate razor fish beneath the sand Once it finds a suitable target it simply digs out its prey The buried fish have no defence against this attack They will simply have to wait and hope they aren't found out This dolphin appears to have a razor fish craving - well, she is pregnant Success, at last The incoming tide sweeps on towards America, flooding across vast flat plains of seagrass They are so shallow that, at low tide, all large fish are forced to retreat into deep water channels Like these nurse sharks... and these stingrays Both predators hunt crustaceans on the seagrass beds, but until the flooding tide brings enough water for them to swim in, they will have to wait So for now this tulip snail it appears safe to patrol the shallows in search of a meal But is it? This I s a rather bigger kind of snail At five kilogrammes in weight, the giant horse conch has little to fear from any shark... and it has a taste for tulip snail Sensing the approaching danger - the snail flees But in a world of snail paces - the conch is something of a Ferrari It calls for desperate measures Exhausted by the effort of its last ditch attempt, the tulip snail is slowly gunned down The tide still has to rise for another hour before the big predators can feed But out on the flats the scent of dying snail wafts away on the tide It's a scent that these hermit crabs are particularly partial to It's vital that the crabs have the best possible protection from the heavy teeth of the waiting sharks and rays For that they need the shell with a perfect fit Today there is new real estate on offer - and competition in this housing market is fierce The action becomes even more desperate when the shell of the devoured snail is ready for release This crab simply can't wait any longer But it's a decidedly risky acquisition The risk paid off handsomely - the new shell is both lighter and stronger than the old home and it's not a moment too soon because the tide is flowing in strongly, flooding the plains At last, the predators are free to start their foraging Both the stingrays and sharks have a highly developed electrical sense which they use to search for buried invertebrates - they can sense minute movements beneath the sand Finding a promising signal, this ray digs out its meal, an unprotected hermit crab would have no chance Within a few hours the tide ebbs out once more, and all the predators are forced to leave They will have to wait until the next high tide before making another feeding foray At certain times of the year called the equinox, spring tides are exceptionally large and rise even higher than normal Now predators can reach the very shallowest fringes of the seagrass flats These two metre long tarpon are heading further inshore still They are heading for the mangroves These flooded forests cover huge areas of the coastal shallows Extraordinarily, the roots of the mangrove trees can live in salt water and they make a perfect nursery for small fish Silversides and snapper find sanctuary in the maze of roots - big predators seldom find a way in here And now the tide is falling once more The water starts losing what little oxygen it contained and quickly becomes stagnant Most predators have abandoned the mangroves, but these tarpon are still here trapped by the falling tide The dissolved oxygen is fast running out, but they have a vital survival technique... ...they can breathe air Pumped up with fresh oxygen they can easily out manoeuvre the dozy silversides The tide has turned again And this is no ordinary tide Since it is the equinox - the tide is rising fast but now out to sea a hurricane is on its way, forcing the tide yet higher The passing storm leaves large areas of the coast flooded by the sea... ...and the low lying islands like the Bahamas are even more prone to storm flooding The sun's power here is immense As the tide recedes and the remaining flood water evaporates - a remarkable transformation takes place... The mud is coated with a magical world of salt Any remaining water is extremely salty - very few creatures can survive here... ...except these brine shrimp And on the water's edge, brine flies Both are the favourite food of an extraordinary animal The Caribbean Flamingo Remarkably, they actually seek out such briny places - they are the best spots for them to find their food And they also provide the protection the flamingos need to raise their young Nesting sites like this are surrounded by corrosive brine It's a formidable barrier to any predators seeking to dine on flamingo chicks The Flamingo takes the precaution of building next Just in case of further flatting Strangely, it's actually the power of the storm tides that gives the flamingos both their food and a perfect habitat in which to breed The breeding of many animals in the ocean is closely co-ordinated with the tidal cycles A half moon in November. It is the time for small tides. Christmas Island in the Pacific Strange happenings are afoot It is one of only a few nights each year when female Christmas Island crabs risk heading down towards the sea Around the island they number in tens of thousands and all of them are laden with hundreds of eggs They have to shed them into the ocean if the eggs are to develop into baby crabs But these are land crabs and they can neither swim nor breathe underwater There is a great risk of drowning, which is why they pick the smallest tides of the month - to minimise the danger The eggs will develop far offshore and in exactly one month's time a great swarm of baby crabs will return, again choosing the perfect tide Whether it's the daily or monthly cycle, tides are the rhythm of the ocean - its pulsing clock For every tide brings opportunity to marine life somewhere in the world Now a spring tide is flooding the shallows and hunters are on the prowl A small group of bottlenose dolphin are working their way inshore to start a quite extraordinary hunting campaign After one successful pass the dolphin move off to start again One animal peels off from the group and swims rapidly in a circle, stirring up the mud and driving the mullet towards the other waiting dolphins It's a remarkable team effort and it is extremely effective The dolphin will feed like this for as long as the tide grants them access to the shallows Eventually the falling tide will force the dolphin to leave the flats and the mullet will be safe once more - until the next high tide Because in the ocean every turn of the tide spells the difference between life and death, somewhere
