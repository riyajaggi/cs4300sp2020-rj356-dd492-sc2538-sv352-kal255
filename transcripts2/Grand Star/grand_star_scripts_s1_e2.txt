 (Multicom Jingle) - [Narrator] Previously on "Grand Star". - [Cal] I saw something. There was this light that I've never seen before. - You've been too many hours on the ice. Ice hamper with your vision, you know that. - The old world's dead. It died with the sun. We have 400,000 kilowatt hours left of energy. And if you don't find us a place where we can relocate-- - We will go the way of the dinosaurs.

 - I always told myself there'd be a day where you'd be honest with me. I'll just wait for that. I just wanna see what the Pointsmen are up to. - [Kurt] Whatever the Pointsmen are doing is none of our business. - [Cal] Hey, hey, this ones' breathing. Why are the Pointsmen after you? - We are the Renewers of the sun. We fight for the truth. - We're taking her back. (thrilling music) (ice crackling) (tense music)

 (ships whirring) Hang on, we're almost there. (computer beeping) (ship whirring) Here. Hey, give me your arm. (electronic music) (door beeping) (tense music) Okay. - Who is that? - My name is Margot. - What happened, Cal? - We found her on the ice. She had been attacked by the Pointsmen. Her and at least 10 others. She's the only one who survived. - [Liam] This could mean real trouble. - I couldn't leave her to die, Dad. She's blind. - [Kurt] She said she saw the sun. - Oh, blind and delusional. Leave her with me. We'll talk about this later. She needs to rest. And don't talk about this to anyone. - You'll be all right, I promise. Could've been worse. (tense music) - The food train arrived an hour ago. I was watching it enter. Take a look. Happened just before the train entered the gateway. - [Guard] There's nothing on my monitor. - That's Ragg's vehicle, isn't it? - [Control Man] What is your position? Repeat, what is your position? - [Announcer] L-Ektrik Corp reminds you it's what's on the inside that counts. - [Cal] I'm taking her back no matter what my dad says. - Okay, good, and then we're done with all this, right? - No. - Why not? - The Pointsmen massacred a bunch of people. She said she saw the sun. - Sh. - What they died for, why not? All right, I don't know what it is, okay? There's just something inside of me that keeps pulling me. - You're reading way too much into all this, okay? We're gonna get into real trouble and I don't wanna be a part of it. - I saw the sun, Kurt. Okay, I saw the sun. - I'm sorry, man, I had to do it. - Kurt. Hey. I'm really mad at you, you said you'd take me to the cabaret. (Kurt chuckles) Hello, Cal. This is my friend, Lila - Hi. - [Friend] So, you boys are all alone, I guess we'll have to join you. (tense music) (Margot coughs) - Where am I? - Grand Star Station. - I've gotta go. - No, you go when you're stronger. - Grand Star. Did you see it? The sun? We brought it out for you. We brought it back for you. - You'll get into a lot of trouble if you talk like that around here. - Oh. You didn't see it. I've gotta go. - No. You go when I tell you. - But the boy saw it, didn't he? Yes. I'm sure he saw it. Didn't he? Didn't he? - [Lila] So, you get to leave Grand Star? - Yeah. - What's it like out there? Is it as terrible as they say? - Eh, I don't know about terrible, but it's, uh, it's nature, and it's real. Not like this place. Excuse me. Suki. Suki. I saw you at the cabaret. Do you remember me? Please, join us. - [Suki] It looks like you're occupied. - No, no, they're just friends of a friend. - He learns quickly, he learns quickly. He's good with his hands. Good at fixing things. That's why I keep him around. - [Cal] Please, just for a minute? - A small one. - Uh, this is Suki from the cabaret. - Oh, the cabaret, how exciting. - Exciting. I guess that's the word for it. - Problem? - Oh, not with you. But you know what they say about some girls who work at the cabaret. - No, what? - Just some girls. I don't mean you, of course. (chuckles) They'll do it with just about any man with credits. - Not like the girls who hang around rich boys with more credits than sense. Interesting company you have, Cal Ragg. - Great. Suki. (tense music) - [Dispatcher] Pointsmen to Garage Eight. Pointsmen to Garage Eight. (ominous music) - Hey. Hey, what do you think you're doing? I hope you're not thinking of confiscating that vehicle. - [Pointsman] You are not authorized. Stay clear of the vehicle. - Hey, this vehicle does not belong to you. You can't do that. - Stay clear of the vehicle. - What are you doing? - Do not interfere or you will face incarceration. - Huh? Hey, this is not yours. This belongs to me and my father. You don't have the right. You don't have the-- - Remain clear of the vehicle. We are under orders from CEO Palidor. - [Cal] This isn't over. - Any vehicle leaving Grand Star can only do so with authorization. You know that. - I didn't. - Come on. It's on camera. We saw you. - I didn't. - Oh, Cal. You really want the world to be the way you wish it to be and not the way it is, huh? You think you can barge in here and change the course of the law just like that? Why are you so convinced that you're entitled to special treatment? That's what I just don't understand. - Does my father know about this? - I couldn't locate him! You know, he's a bit like you. Neither here nor there. Never really anywhere. - That Ice Fox is our private property. - There is no private property on Grand Star. Everything is the property of the Pointsmen. Until you understand that, you will find me on your path. You understand me now? Good. (electronic music) (upbeat music) (speaking in foreign language) - [Announcer] Your future is brighter with L-Ektrik Corp. - Hey, rich kid. Aren't you gonna say hello? - I'm kinda busy. And you shouldn't be wearing those, they can get you into trouble. - No sun, no sunglasses? Yeah yeah yeah, I know the Pointsmen are going to put me in jail. Paid 'em 40 credits on the black market. You like 'em? - Actually, yes. Hey, I'm sorry about what happened earlier. - You should be. That strange little ship the Pointsmen were taking away, was it yours? - The Ice Fox? Yeah. Well, it used to be. - Why were they taking it away? - Suki, I'd like to tell you. - You can talk to me, Cal. I know how to keep my mouth shut. Hey. Are the Pointsmen after you because you've been black marketing? - Look, I can't talk to you right now. But can I see you later? - Later? Sure. Why not? Can't promise though, you know, me and later. We're not from the same planet. Hey, Cal. If the Pointsmen put me in jail, you'll come and get me, right? - Yeah. Yeah. - We really need that vehicle. - I know. It's my mistake. - Well, it's all right. But you gotta be careful. They are very disappointed that I didn't find an alternative source of energy. And my name will no longer protect you. - I'm not scared. - Well, you should be. Lieutenant Damien, I need that vehicle back, now. - Professor Ragg. Well, you can always petition CEO Palidor. What were you doing out there anyway, huh? - That is none of your business. (Damien scoffs) - I am in charge of security here. State your purpose. - No. - Track 24 boarded on a restricted area. I have every right to know your intent. - [Liam] Oh, you want to know my intention? - [Damien] Mm-hmm. - My intention was to find alternative sources of energy for Grand Star, that is what I was doing. I have probes set up in all sectors surrounding Grand Star. If I get a positive reading, I go and investigate. Restricted sector or not. Now, I'm going to go and see CEO Palidor and tell him that you are hindering me in my mission. - That wouldn't be necessary. - And the Ice Fox had better not be damaged. (electronic music) - [Damien] Well? - We have completed the operation on Track 24. All evidence has been destroyed. - Good. And the Renewers' bodies? - They've been dealt with. - Very good. How many in total? - 12. - [Margot] You saw it, didn't you? - No. - Don't be afraid of the truth. For one moment in time, you saw the past and the future together. - No, I saw a storm. - It was the sun. The giver of all life. (angelic music) Go on. Don't deny what you saw. - Cal. She has to leave now. She can't stay here any longer. - Where do we take her? - Well, back to wherever she came from. I've got a plan. Tell Kurt we're gonna need his help. (pleasant tones) (doors creaking) (communicator beeping) - Yeah? Yeah, I'm on my way there anyway. Okay. - [Damien] You told me there were 12 bodies. There should have been 13. Liam Ragg is up to something. Get me a tactical intervention team now. (dramatic music) - I know I can't stay. I'm a danger to you and yours. There's a place which was once called Folkston. I have people there. - On one condition. - Yes? - That you do not talk to my son again. - You shouldn't be afraid of the truth. - It is not the truth. - You're a scientist, are you not? - Yes. - Well, then you lied to me. Because you know the sun exists. And you know it was never destroyed. - You should rest. - Your son is special. I can feel it. - Yes, he is very special. - Mm-hmm. - To me. So never talk to him again. (tense music) - Stand back. - Step aside. - [Pointsman] Move back. - Cardiff, please tell me you're ready. According to surveillance, there should be three people in this train. I knew it. There are four people in there. One of them must be the missing Renewer. (door banging) - Whatever you're hiding in there, you better get rid of it. - Yeah, come on. - There's a squad of Pointsmen outside. - [Cal] I know. - [Suki] Who's she? - You didn't see her. - Cal, get the hatch. I'll take her below and make my way to the Ice Fox. You take care of Damien. - Do we have a go? - Yes, stand by. - [Liam] Help her down. - You saved my life, thank you. But there are many more to be saved. - I don't know if I can do that. - Come on. - You have to, that's why you're here. - How do you know all this about me? (door banging) - Professor Ragg. - Come on, let's go. - Because you were the one who saw the truth and did something about it. - Open this door. - Cal, we have to go. - [Damien] Professor Ragg. I know you've got a Renewer. - What's that? - Your destiny. - Open this door or we're gonna have to enter by force. - We really have to go now. Come on. Help her down. - As you wish. Sergeant. (electronic music) Take this door down. (Pointsmen shouting) (thrilling music) - [Pointsman] Something's blocking our entry from inside. - [Cal] I don't know if I can do that. - [Margot] That's why you're here. - [Cal] How do you know all this about me? - [Margot] It's your destiny. You saved my life, Cal. - Do this. - [Pointsman] Come on, move in. (dramatic music) - Our sensor detected four people in here. - That's right. Kurt, myself, my father, who just left, and then Suki. - You were under orders to open the doors to the train. You refused. Why? - Just because you wear that stupid uniform does not mean I need to listen to you. (gun whirring) - I am the authority here. - In your mind, not mine. - Where did your father go? - To replace remote probes near Alpha Base. (Damien laughs) - You're lying. - Prove it. - Suki. A Pointsman can provide a girl like you with many things. - Hm. I'm sure you could. - Stay away from her, Damien. - Because you think she's yours? Huh? I mean, what can you give her that I can't? - Hey, you two, get it straight. I'm neither one of yours. Especially you. (electronic music) - Nice. (upbeat music) (Ice Fox whooshing) - I have a question. - Yeah? - Did you will that door closed? - I don't know. Hey, do you know the history of our world? - Look, I may be from the cabaret, but I'm not stupid. The old world was dying, it was becoming superheated and then our sun went nova and the Great Freeze came. Everybody knows that. - But do you believe it? - What is there to believe? It just is. Like the ice. - Yeah, but what if there still was a sun and we could walk the world like it was? - You believe that? I don't. Later, Cal Ragg. - Hey. If the Pointsmen put me in jail, you'll come get me, right? - [Suki] Yeah, yeah. - What's that? - It's your destiny. (upbeat electronic music) (Multicom Jingle)
