They diverted our attention and took the chance to infiltrate our headquaters Also they knew how to evade our securitysystem and enter And From the way they used the wireless network,amongst other factors, it looks like they have been doing prior research on NSS Either that or they have an ex-NSS agent amongst them Why did they attack NSS It's the RND data bank RND data bank Or rather, the equipment stored in the data bank So far no one else knows about this Yes Coming over right now Where's the call from Blue House (President's office) Say, how can such a thing happen The counter-terrorist force was instead attacked by terrorists How preposterous Who were the ones who attacked NSS Have you managed to find out In the midst of investigation Shouldn't this matter be handledby the Director of Internal Affairs The North Korean ambassador has arrived If word of this gets out It'd be so embarrasing Mr. President wants to meet you I will bear full responsibility and resign Even if you do that you'd still have to settle this matter right I've already began investigations on theterrorists' background Then using this as a starting point, further investigations will be carried out Other than that why did these terrorists attack NSS You were their target and since they have the guts to attack NSS there should be a very special motive There's one It's not mentioned in the submitted report What is it An item in the care of NSS has gone missing It's a very precise electronic detonation device Did you say detonation device A detonation device, that upon reaction withsolid uranium will cause a nuclear reaction You mean a nuclear weapon The equipment in the care of NSS did not include solid uranium Besides, solid uranium is not easily obtained But if someone already has the solid uranium,then planned this attack This means that person has a highly reactive nuclear bombthat could explode at any moment You mean that now this group of terrorists already have thenuclear bomb You can say that Where are you now We have retreated safely We are now awaiting further orders Casualty report We lost three men Before we engage in battle again We'd need reinforcements Stay low and wait for me to contact you Yes I got it They'll need reinforcements Yes sir Very soon when the solid uranium arrives you'll have to combine these two Can you do that Yes Everyone is curious as to what this is but now's not the time to say anything You have to keep this a secret Got it What The fellow who killed Gye Dong and Myeong Su was a female That's right And she was the one who called for reinforcements This bunch of good-for-nothings Because of this bitch What happened to her Did you manage to kill her No That woman Do you remember what she looks like Everyone until we receive further orders we'll remain here When will we get further orders That I don't know either Where did that guy go to He's outside Don't leave him out Keep an eye on him Yes From now on cut the formalities outside of work If you won't regret, then we'd do just that What regret Say it Alright Choi Seung Hee Wah, it feels weird [the wind enters my heart] [and gradually erodes all memories of you] [my dreams are filled with regret] [thinking of you] [I'm still standing here] [I can endure each passing day] [because you once said you loved me] [I can endure each passing month] [because you once gazed at me] [I loved you] [and still am loving you] [the wound is getting deeper] [but I cannot help myself] [being unable to hold my promise of loving you] No matter the reason[being unable to hold my promise of loving you] I will not do this[being unable to hold my promise of loving you] I will not do this I will not do this[I had to leave you] If you're not going to do it, then I'llfind someone else[I had to leave you] Leave, and call Choi Seung Hee in[I had to leave you] Leave, and call Choi Seung Hee in Leave, and call Choi Seung Hee in[but I will continue loving you] [but I will continue loving you] [I will await your return] [Do you still remember the times we had together] [Words that I cannot say] If because of a so-called conscience and sense of responsibility[Words that I cannot say] a person's ambition is wavered[Words that I cannot say] a person's ambition is wavered a person's ambition is wavered[Words that I've wanted to say] [Words that I've wanted to say] Then he will never amount to anything[Words that I've wanted to say] Then he will never amount to anything Then he will never amount to anything[I want to say it to you now] [I want to say it to you now] [I love you] From this view point[I love you] From this view point I made a correct choice when I chose you when I chose you[I love you] [I love you] Isn't that right It's me What's up I have to meet you now I don't have that kind of free time We'll see about it next time I must meet you now What's wrong with you Have you been drinking Yes When I'm sober, I cannot take it anymore so I drank a little I drank when I thought of Hyun Jun I drank when I thought of Seung Hee I drank when I thought of you, who changed my life so drastically That's how I drank, and drank and finally I'm drunk Why did you choose me Why did you choose me Do you want to push me to desperation Jin Sa Woo, you listen up That's right, I chose you but you were the one who made the final decision Who are you trying to blame now If you continue spouting nonsense like this I will not let you off easily Chief Is the autopsy report out yet Not yet Have you manage to investigate the terrorists' background No But there's one thing I'm sure of that amongst us, someone assisted the terrorists They could use the security system toview our internal department But the important thing is they used a wireless delivery system If there weren't a spy amongst us how would they know that we're also using this system NSS internal department Who's it Now there's not enough information to find out How's Seung Hee She's to be discharged soon What have you guys found The Criminal Investigation Office is analyzingthe terrorists' corpses and their personal belongings There shouldn't be anything new yet Have you found their motive for attacking NSS Follow me Detonation device With a precision of more than 99.9%, a powerful detonation device It's highly reactive nature has been tested in labs Highly reactive You mean a nuclear weapon Once it's combined with solid uranium it'll become a nuclear weapon If one of these is installed in Seoul's central district the Blue House, Congress and all other government properties will bedirectly affected Estimated death toll is at least 150,000 So far, this confidential information is onlyknown to those of top ranks Unless you receive orders, you are not to take action √ä√≤√ò Yes Coming over right now Yes Is it possible that they've already left the country If that's the case then the problem becomes more complicated The S. Korean government will face reproach by the international community and suffer economic sanctions From now onwards the whole of NSS will put their utmost efforts into the investigations Search all present nuclear research centers in the country Then search the nuclear material production plants Yes Work together with the national guardsand bring the national security level to the highest Yes sir The preparation for talks with the North is underway Ah, that Before they leave Arrange a time for me to meet them personally Yes, got it Do you have anything else Yes There's one thing I don't understand Alright, what's it Director Baek San did he report something that I'm unaware of In his report he only mentioned the losses but not the terrorists' motive for doing so That, using common sense to judge there should have been some special reason for them to attack NSS right Yes there is but I don't think now's the time to spill it Ah, yes If Mr. President feels that way, then I have nothing else to say What I must tell you sir is please do not put too much trust in Director Baek San It's me within the Blue House, the president is the only one who knows It should be for the good of the cross-border talks Yes I think even if the nuclear weapon posed a threat the president will still want the talks to continue Yes I will contact you again How many exits are there from the main lobby A total of six exits Are there any other possible dead zones that a subversive could make use of Except for the concession we made for the guests' privacy basically all other areas are under surveillance During the talks can our personnel be in ambush here This you can help yourselves These terrorists what's their background Could it be that they were sent by the North Very soon, we'd be undergoing talks with them they probably wouldn't have made such a rash decision What's the president's reaction Not much change We just saw the security preparations Please take a seat So how was it What do you think of it Generically it should be fine but as for the security personnel If that is a problem the president's gatehouse will act as the front-line defense followed by the National Police The North and South have many differences For us, like when the late President Kim came we can have all the control over the situation including who was in the welcoming group These people have to undergo strict identity checks that means, there was never a threat posed tothe safety of leaders from both sides But, the South is different This is Seoul's central district as surely as there'd be people who welcome this,there'd be others who do not As for the preparation of security and defense there should have been some problems right During the talks, the area surrounding the guest houses will be patrolled by a sufficient amount of policeand security guards Year 1999, 3rd of June I don't know if you remember, but at the Kim Pyeo (lit.) airport a civilian threw an egg at the S. Korean president If such a thing happens during the talks, you will find it hard to settle it right Hey What did we take from NSS No idea Just tell me, you punk I really don't know !@#$%^ We've already lost three men yet we don't know what we're doing. What's this If you're unhappy, complain to the boss why are you venting your frustrations on me Really, you I won't do anything silly You don't have to use that uneasy expression on me I thought Seung Hee died because that day at Budapest, the car she was in blew up right before my eyes After I witnessed that I could not come up with an alternative conclusion Now this is what I have left to do This is the file from Baek San's information vault Help me see what's inside Got it What did they take from NSS Do you have any idea What are you doing Um, nothing much If you're bored, come play cards with us I'm fine Don't worry Have you seen it What's inside Includes all the missions Baek San has undertaken while at NSS everything has a great impact on the cross-border relations It can all be tied back to IRIS and Baek San Also, it includes information on the scientists involved when the South was carrying out nuclear research Inside also contains information on your parents What did you just say Geum Jeong Gug Yun	Mi Yeon Aren't those your parents' names I have no memories of my parents I entered the orphanage when I was about 7 I only know that they passed away in a traffic accident As for what they do I didn't even remember my name Say, what's next Both were involved in nuclear research Nuclear physicists What's your name Kim Hyun Jun The person who staged the accident was Baek San The person who sent you to the orphanage was also Bake San After that He watched you when you were growing up Group Leader Are youfeeling better now I'm fine Even so, you should rest a while more What's happening now Now we're analyzing the corpses Have you seen how they looked like Of course Is there anything special Nothing special Nothing much See if you can identify them Nope Now, even the forensics don't have much clues Is like something happened amongst the top ranks But what it is, we don't know Have you verified it Yes What is it I don't know Really You useless bunch Come out Wow, you're discharged so soon Yeah Are you very busy Because we've found nothing solid This bunch of people, really Those things that could have become evidencehave already been removed But after all, they are the elites to be able to enter NSS What, you have something to say That time, you mentioned the software Um, that, that That, through the bone profiling software Ah Hey, the few of you, take a break Yes Take a seat Let's hear about it Last time, that footage from the web camera You said it had a 74% similarity with Hyun Jun Yes, that's right Then is it possible to confirm that that was Hyun jun Tell me, chief That, well that That day because of Sa Woo's strong objection I was afraid it'd cause more chaos, so I just left it as it was But according to the results you can determine that that person was Hyun Jun Jung In, come over here for a while When you were held hostage did you see how the terrorists looked like Well, we did see them but they were masked You saw the footage of me in the information vault right Yeah Then, the terrorist I confronted the part where he accidentally killed his own people That could it possibly not be an accident I feel that he did it to save me, intentionally What are you saying Why would he do that That person feels like Hyun Jun What The information you got from Budapest on Hyun Jun's death is that reliable Seung Hee What's wrong with you I know it sounds absurd but please do me a favour and confirm the news with the Budapest agency Wireless transmission Complete We've connected How long do we have The footage will be replaced by a still imagefor 60 seconds Converting... You can leave now After you enter the stairwell You will find a staff-only elevator Changing CCTV data It's been hard on you There's nothing that can identify them on the corpses Even the fingerprints are gone, very thorough What about the fingerprint report Nothing When you said nothing There weren't prints on the fingers even The forensics group tried to match their photographs and dental records We've even seek help from foreign records but nothing matches Weren't there any personal belongings on them Same Clothes and items are very common, nothing special Even the weapons'd be very hard to trace But there's one thing We've analyzed the dirt on the bodies And there's something special On all the bodies, clothes and shoes we found some water-silicate compound We thought it was weird so we did further investigations That compound was Actinolite Ah, can't you simplify it It's asbestos Although it's still in the raw form But even though it's found on the clothes and shoes the autopsy shows that their respiratory system is free of it Which means They just came in contact with it Which means after they entered our country they've always stayed at a place which had to do with asbestos Bravo You can say that Whether it's a construction site or factoryasbestos is found everywhere This can't be a clue right That's not necessarily the case If it's actinolite then is a very uncommon asbestos besides, because of its brittleness it was banned in 2003 They are very paranoid and would be sure to find a deserted and open placefor their base camp I think that place should be one that mines or refines actinolite a deserted plant or warehouse They could divert our attention and take the chance to attack NSS I think their base camp shouldn't be far from here So If we list out all the deserted warehouses I think we stand a great chance Very well, list the warehouses Once you're done, hand it to me Seung Hee Come over for a while Have you verified it Yeah The Budapest agency says they've never transmitted such an article Then how did this come about Did you view it for yourself Someone purposefully entered the article into the system Then, then who did it I don't know either I can't think of who it might be How about combining it We should be fine As for the date and place, I'll give you further instructions Until then, keep it secret Got it How's Kim Hyun Jun So far, no problems He was a big help when we attacked NSS Go in and take a look I heard that because of you, this NSS attack was very successful Since you're willing to cooperate, I will fulfill my side of the bargain Can't you tell me what you took from NSS It's not that I don't trust you it's that we're all victims of circumstances Very soon in Seoul's central district something big and unexpected is going to happen I have absolute trust in you I will no longer restrict your movements If you're together with Sun Hwa you're free to make your own decisions I heard that the detonation device within theRND data bank has been stolen That means, Seoul's central district could be in danger of an explosion right Yes In fact, that group of people helped you and meachieve what we were supposed to do That bunch of people cannot be caught before it happens Go Mess up their investigations Yes Come in I have something to say to you Go on I'll leave first No, it's okay Sa Woo, you have to listen to this too Kim Hyun Jun is alive Where's it Above the steps Father Father Father Hyun Jun Father Father Father Next episode preview We have to leave, quick I'm in S.
