 Chiang-wei, you like Chiang-ta. I... Why are you always thinking about it? Even dream of Wang Chiang-ta. The math and history of Hsiao Chien. Let's see her school test which one is better. Let's bet on it. Wang Chiang-wei is Dorothy. I'm delighted that we are one,

 not zero, Wang Chiang-ta. Nice to meet you, Dorothy. I think that Hsiao Chien didn't try her best. No matter what the degree of difficulty is, she still gets the same score. I think she did it intentionally. Uncle Hsun. Hi, Chiang-ta. You guys must be bats. You rarely come here during the daytime. Actually, we come here for Hsiao Chien.

 What happened to her? She... Did you know that I posted a difficult math problem on the internet? I attended a tutorial class because someone solved it. Actually, that person was Hsiao Chien. In other words, she's very good at math. So why are her scores so bad? I think she did it intentionally. How is that possible? I let her attend tutorial class. Uncle Hsun, Hsiao Chien is a good girl. I trust that she did it because she has her own reason. What reason? There's only one thing that she should be doing now, that is to study hard. I work hard to earn and save money. I also plan for her to study abroad, so she can have a better future. Uncle Hsun, Hsiao Chien hid her talent for a long time. She must be very meticulous and very sensitive about this. Hsiao Chien. Do I look like my mother? Why do you ask me that question? Because I look like mother, I remind you of her whenever you see me. That's why you dislike me. What are you talking about? I don't want to study aboard. I want to be with you. Live together in the restaurant. Hsiao Chien. Not bad. A happy ending. I would prefer it if my dad forced me to study hard. Wang Chiang-ta. You are seemingly emotional today. Because today is a special day. Nobody's in the restaurant at the moment! Oh, my! This is Hsiao Chien's recent report card. Let me check it. We had a bet. You re so confident. I'm a little worried. Is it really terrible? Math. Eighty-two points. Eighty-two points for math is good. Let me tell you her history score. Eighty-eight points. -Eighty-eight, six points more. -Really? -So... -I‘m done... You said Chiang-ta can deduct five points. You are dead. Old Yen. I bet 2,000. Give me money. 3,000. So sorry. Chiang-ta, you are ungrateful. Did you lose to her intentionally? No, I didn't. Also, Hsiao Chien is the lead and you are the one who did the gambling. Yes. Boss, just think of it as you treating us to a meal. And she 's also your student. You should be pleased for her. Okay, I give up. I can afford it. Send in the betting records. A bet is a bet. I'll pay you. Okay, let us check it... All right? Si-te, a double. Jen-i. Five times. Thank you. Chiang-wei. Old Guo. Old Guo, you had bet on Chiang-wei? You bet 10,000 on a times 10 payout? -My god. -I’m killing you. Thanks for Teacher Guo's appreciation. Why do you have too much money? Teacher Wang, I won against you by six points. You shall not act shamelessly again. According to this receipt, "You can demand NTD 100,000 or command Wang Chiang-ta to do anything unconditionally." Signed by Wang Chiang-ta. Of course, I want money. Are you joking? No, you should think about it carefully. Wang Chiang-ta will do one thing for you unconditionally. This is far more than NTD 100,000. Besides, please read it carefully. There's no deadline. -You are right. -Yes. Wang Chiang-wei, you have to look at the big picture. If we take into consideration inflation, NTD 100,000 will be less and less. But the value of the thing that Wang Chiang-ta will do for you will be higher over the time. Compare the two then, I think you know what to choose. Teacher Wang, you are breaking the rules. There is no doubt that debts should be paid. You just give me a receipt for a loan and want to persuade me to give up NTD 100,000. Are you refusing to pay? No. If you really want money, then all right, I owe you money. Your creditor, Sun Xiao Shan, can not ask for the money right now. You think too much. Even though Sun Xiao Shan isn't here, her brother is rushing me for the money. Besides, why should I approve your debt? Let me ask you, will you try to escape? Of course not. -Why would I escape? -You wouldn't dare. Yes. So if both the creditor and debtor will not escape, what are you worried about? You... Wang Chiang-ta, reconciliation agreement says that I shall pay 200,000 within three months. You shall pay me before the deadline. You have to. No problem. Well, if I really don't have any money to pay, you can just keep living at my place and the rent can offset the debt. Like what you said before. You... HSIAO TIEH Hi. This is the promotion DM of Jia De Group. The auction will start three days later. The point is that we got inside. The lost antique in the case of that time will be there. It has been lost for 23 years. It finally appears. -Really? -Yes. We have a clue, but I have to remind you, antique is traded in marked for so many times. Don't expect it too much. I know. Hsiao Tieh. Why are you here? I know you are always here. Well, she's an antique appraiser. You are an appraiser? Yes. You guys didn't know? We can take you to the auction. Then... Perhaps... Good idea. -Do you need my help? -Yes. No problem. You shall pay me the standard appraisal fees. We don't actually need detailed appraisal service. I mean, you can go to the auction with us, if we saw something interesting, we'll let you know. You can just tell us a simple history background about the item. Well, my minimum rate is NTD 3,000. Appraisal rate is NTD 3,000 to NTD 8,000. But since we know each other, if you ask for more than three items, I can give you a 20% discount. Forget it. He means you can forget the 20% discount. Just tell us the original price. Really, just forget it. Whatever you want is okay. All right. It's okay if the miser doesn't want to pay. Only if you guys beg genuinely, I will say yes. It's human nature. Friends help each other. So for this favor, I will beg. Ms. Chiang-wei, can you please help us? And you? Hurry. Ms. Chiang-wei, although we are good friends, but in this case, politeness is necessary. Could you please help us? Please. All right. -Let me think twice. -Hey. It's okay. She's a lady. Just let her think about it twice. Okay? Sometimes, you should be willing to pay. Don't be mean like that. Hi, Uncle Qin. The paperweight that you asked me last time, it looks like a similar one would be in auction at Jia De. Really? That's good. Thank you. Teacher Qin? Yes? What did he say? He asked me to come to that auction with you. Great. Good. Chan Ting-hsuan. Why do you worry about him? Well... I just heard that he got out of prison a few days ago. But there's no news about him. I'm not sure if he is... still impulsive like he was before. Old Yen, don't worry. It has been a long time ago. We were still young then. He has his own life now. I helped him out. -But... -There's no but. I’m a man who is loyal to my friends. Just keep your promise and I'll take care of you. If everyone keeps their promises, I will take care of everyone. Okay, I trust you... Really? A method that will certainly win in a gamble? It's a probability issue. Of courses, there's a method. I shouldn't have been too naive. My god, please forgive me for cursing my math teacher when I was still in middle school. Teacher Wang. Please teach me. Actually, it's a simple math theory. You have to know how much money you'll win first. Let's say you want to win NTD 100, you have a 50% chance of winning. What if I lose? You also have a 50% chance of losing. But that's okay. If you lose, just double your bet. Make it NTD 200. If you lose again, just double it again. Make it NTD 400. Following this pattern, you will win in the end. In the end, how much I can win? Just NTD 100. I've told you. Don't worry. I'm not done just yet. Let's take the NTD 100 as an example. When it comes to 16th round, the bet will become three million NTD. But in the end, you can only win NTD 100. So, my conclusion is... never gamble. I should have known, it's pointless to learn math. Thanks. Nice. Wang Chiang-ta. Do you know what your problem is? You think way too much on calculating probabilities. Don't calculate every day. Then what should I do? Use more of your heart and less of your brain. It sounds... impulsive. You know it's dangerous. You obviously know what I'm trying to say. That's how you act on your dad's case. Take me as an example. As long as I stay with Chiang-wei, I feel happy. At times, I blush. I feel nervous and shy. I don't know why. I don't want to think about it. All I know is I like her. Seriously? Yes. I'm serious. I want to date her. Calculation is useless if you like someone, because it's 100%. You think I'm cool? You are attracted to me? Right? What am I doing? I should be happy because Tieh is falling in love. Tell me, what is the probability of meeting you among seven billion people? Forget it. It's my probability. I'll decide on it. -Are you going to the auction? -Yes. Uncle Hsun. Let's go there together. I can't. I have to take care of the restaurant. Time is crucial when running a restaurant. Uncle Hsun is feeling sad. But... will there be clues in the auction? Uncle Hsun, you should ask Quang Da, who's got this sad look since we arrived here. Chiang-ta. Why are you so impulsive? Just let the police solve it. Yes. Uncle Hsun, the auction venue is open to the public, there will be no problem. The goods will have been passed through a lot. Even if you find the buyer, what good will that be? Uncle Hsun, great minds think alike. Uncle Hsun, did you add vinegar in the noodle today? It's a little sour. Really? Really? My flavoring is correct. Could I be wrong? Yes. Uncle Hsun, he's talking nonsense. It's okay. I'll take one more. Pass me the table napkin. Good night everybody. I'm Su Fei. It's time forThe Midnight Starry Sky. First, let's welcome Dorothy. Hello, everybody. It's coming... Your favorite. -My favorite, -Don't be like that. -Wang Chiang-wei. -In this fictitious world Dorothy is real. She really has special qualities. Sometimes, her joke is really... Really cold, bad, and not funny. But let me tell you this, today, my joke is very funny. Come on, showtime. All right, do you guys know who is Ruan Jing Tian's Granduncle? That's difficult. Ruan Jing Tian. The answer is Ruan Gu Gong. Not funny? Someone said Dorothy's joke is so boring. What I'm laughing about is that Dorothy's joke is obviously boring, she tells it in a serious way and really enjoys it. I think people don't find her funny. I think they find her ridiculous. -Hey. -What? Isn't that too much to say? She's a comedian. She thinks that her jokes are funny, and tries her best to make her jokes funny. I think that's being responsible and having true dedication. He's serious. So serious. Actually, what Sofie said was right. Dorothy is really a dedicated girl. No matter what the problem is, she's always dedicated. It doesn't matter if it's for her students or for her class. -Even care for her student's families. -Wait... She's a teacher? I mean, she's like a life tutor of the listeners. She shares her life experience to encourage so many people. Yes. Life tutor. What's wrong with him? He's weird today. Okay, let's be serious and talk about heavy topic. For example your weight. It's too heavy. I think we can talk something shallow. For example your IQ. Uncle Hsun, give him a cup of water, please. Actually, we are investigating this case privately. So, on the day of the auction I think it's better to be cautious. -Then... -I know. Thanks for your good intention. It's not a big deal. -Tie. -What? Thank you... for investigating this case with me, even though it won't help you with your promotion, and it seems to be unsolvable. My pleasure. We are friends. You don't have to say that. Chiang-wei is back. There are two kinds of pain in this world. Tthe things that you never had the things that you've lost and will never return back. Those things that you never had is better than losing and never have it again. If we don't fall in love, there'll be no pain. To love in a man's world, is to not leave the person that you love. That is why I didn't ask you to stay. But in a woman's world, if you love me, you would find me. And that's why I won't turn back. We had drunken chats, we talk like we understand each other. We're strangers but our thoughts are the same. Sometimes, drunken words speak the truth. Actually, I don't drink that well. The smell of your hair is special. Are you okay? I... I'm okay. I... I want to go to the toilet. Okay. Damn it. I'm so stupid. Why did I stop? Shall I still serve the two desserts? Yes, the lady will come back soon. She seems to have left already. Sir, you left this. I probably won't meet her again. Really? Yes, it's really unexpected. Chiang-ta. Come here. I... Come here, hurry. I want to tell you some good news. Chiang-wei's landlord called to tell her that his apartment is for sale. So, she won't have to rent to Chiang-wei. Yes, I just got the call. So I told Chiang-wei that since she's already living here, she's happy and comfortable. So... Well... Do you want to ask his opinion? Landlord Wang, I know that if I live here I might disturb you guys. So... So can your rent fee pay for my debts? Is that okay? Don't lie to me. You're taking the receipt. It's up to you. Good. Welcome to our family. There's way too much probability that's happening here. Well, when are you going to move? -The sooner, the better. -Hi. -Yes. -If you need my help. Okay. Did you receive my email? Okay, in the second letter it says that there are so many buses in APP. -If I'm not a prosecutor, -Yes. I would be a singer. Yes. -Let me show you. -Please check your program. Please check another e-mail. I have... I sent you a new version. I haven't played in a long time. Okay, please keep processing it and let me know later. I can play. Let me teach you. -Okay. -Okay, bye. If you have not learned guitar before. You should press here. Press the second string using your index finger. -Second string. -Yes. Recently, Tieh annoys me. I need to calm down. You can do this softly. Like this? Let me show you a different style. -All right？ -Okay. Yes, please. Niu Niu, do you have the general information of each teacher? I am writing a paper about the culture of tutors. And also -the education system -Okay, Teacher Wang -compare with each other... -I will give you... I really think that I'm just an intern, but I manage everything. It's practically a slave's wage. I think you can use this for your paper. -Here you go. -Thank you. WANT CHIANG-WEI BIRTHDAY, BLOOD GROUP Ready？ Let's go. You guys are on a date? -No. -No. I‘m moving into a new place today. Teacher Wang, will you help me do it? Teacher Wang is so nice. Let's go. You got a package. Wait, I have something to send. Wait a moment. You can take a look. Recommend students and you can earn money. CHANG-TAI TUTORIAL CLASS Do you like dolls? Yes. I like cute dolls. DOLLS She never cooks. COOKING Done with the kitchen? You... -That's... -That's not mine. No, I mean... That's a birthday gift given by a silly friend. But I never wore it. So it's not mine. Can we have a meal after the moving company arrives? Sure. Your kids go to tutorial class? "Chang-tai Tutorial Class." I was seeing Yen ba start his business till now. It’s not easy. Remember, don’t call the name, use code. Okay. I'm Hsiao-shan. It's my friend Black Devil. -I'm Yen-pa -Okay. You were talking about "Yen-pa." Who is he? The boss of Chang-tai. CHANG-TAI CHINESE LANGUAGE YEN CHANG-TAI Thanks. You can eat them all? Do you regret about the treat? Of course not. Eat as much as you want. I'm worried that you will be stuffed just to take advantage of me. No need to worry. Ma'am, your drink. Thanks. What drink is that? Sugar-free green tea. -The dishes are ready. -Okay. 100% CONNECTION COMPATIBILITY ANALYSIS? What are you doing? Mobile game? No. So mysterious. -I'll go find the seats. -Okay. Swings! Hold it. When I was little, I was short and slow. It's hard for me to get one. Today, I want to play enough. When you go up, try to put your core up. When you go down, try to put your core down. The core is the key to play a swing. Okay. Let me try it. Smart girl. You are a good teacher. Wang Chiang-wei is bright and clear sincere and frank. Wang Chiang-ta is acute, sensitive arrogant. You guys are not quite fit. COMPATIBILITY RESULT Are you serious? Yes. I'm definitely chasing her. Calculation is not needed for falling in love because it's 100%. No need to think again. The result is not bad. I give in. What's wrong with you today? You out of your mind? You... Why using strength so much? Just be serious. Come on, second round. Come on. You wanna play hard? I'll play hard. I'll beat your ass off. Wang Chiang-ta. Change it. You win... Lighter, please. What's wrong with you today? You hate me and Fei? I don't think we offend you. Please. Every debt has its debtor. It's him. It's none of my business. Fei, have to modest. You worked hard lately, right? -Take him down. -He's taking me down, don't you see? -Tieh Pu-fan. -What? Are you serious about chasing Chiang-wei? I'll be good to her. I'll be serious and I'm pretty sure. What? Mrs. Chiang-wei? I'm serious too. -No talking. -None of your business. Since it's none of my business. Just let me go. Okay. If you are serious, from now on. Don't muddle along. Delete all of the pictures and contacts of all those girls from your phone. Are you kidding me? Do you think it's a game? You think I'm a playboy? Those pictures and phone numbers are from my friends. Some are from my friend's friend's brother's sister's sister. Will you delete them or not? Why should I delete them? Some are memories. Some are my really good friends. Will you delete them or not? Will you please delete them? -Please... -Okay. I will go and take a shower first. Bye. Hello. Boss. I found the Yen-pa who backstabbed me and shot me. What? You can't imagine it. Yen-pa set up a tutorial class now. Education business. It's really funny. I spent two decades in jail while this guy is living so well. Calm down, Chan. Calm down? I'm pretty calm. I was shot, have been caught, and put in jail. Now I'm having trouble walking. I have nothing. I want a revenge. It's just fair. Chan. It's all in the past. Half of our lives are over. You should enjoy your life. No need to worry about finding a job. I'll take care of you. Boss. You don't want me to deal with him? Times have changed. I've also quit. At those year We set you with enough money back then. -You should... -Boss. I know it's not easy for you to get all the stuff you have now. So don't worry. You just go mind your business. As for mine, I'll deal with it by myself. I'll never get you in trouble. Chan. Hello. YEN CHANG-TAI -It's good. -Yummy! Whatever flavor you like, I'll buy it for you. It's up to you. Try it, Wang Chiang-ta. It's yummy. Yes, delicious. -Not bad. -I don't want it. What’s going on with them? They looked fine before. Yes. Weird. If he doesn't want it, I want it. No. Hello? Let me go somewhere quiet. Just hold on. Yes, yours has be registered in the auction list successfully. Great... What if it’s not been successfully sold? Don't worry about it. We are an international company. If it's failed, your lot can be sold in a private way. Awesome. I hope I can sell the mall at once. -Bye, teacher. -Bye. -Bye, teacher. -Bye. -Bye. -Thanks. Wang Chiang-ta. What's wrong with you today? Uncomfortable? No. Just a little tired. I go first. Chiang-wei. You still here. Teacher Si-te. Wang Chiang-ta has gone? His bike is not here, so I guess so. Chiang-wei. There's a saying "There's no free lunch" Do you agree? Yeah, I agree. No pain. No gain. Do you know it's the same in a relationship? Even though you fall with someone on the first sight. But without the management follow-up. There will be no result. You misunderstand. Nothing between me and Wang Chiang-ta. Don't deny it so quickly. It works for everyone. Take me as an example. If I'm certain that he's the right one, and fall in love with him, I am the type of girl who will go for it. What？ Nothing. Just thinking you are so cool and know what you want. Besides, so direct. Happiness won't just fall from the sky, you know. Sometimes we should depend on ourselves. Girls should be with the right person at our best age. Depend on ourselves. Tieh. -You get off work -Why are you here? Are you here for me? Actually, I am... Looking for me? Yes, just... I got a thing to let her know -So I'm here for her. -Okay. Well... let's go. -Call me. -Okay. -Bye -Bye... Where are we going to? A place you went to. Wang Chiang-ta? What happened to those guys> -Uncle Hsun. -Hi. Let's see who's coming. Uncle Hsun, good evening. Welcome. Chiang-ta is not here? He's always here, but he didn't come here every day. What happened? Nothing. I just thought he's here today. Uncle Hsun. Show her some awesome dishes. Okay. Chiang-wei. What do you think about Wang Chiang-ta? What? Why did you ask me this so suddenly? Nothing, just curious. You guys got along with each other for a time. You know, although he's so cool and so cold. But sometimes, he won't care about people's feeling. Wang Chiang-ta. He's just weird. Sherlock Big Cat. Tieh Pu-fan, you said that you want to chase Chiang-wei. Are you serious? If you are serious, from now on don't muddle along. Delete all of the pictures and contacts of so-called sisters from your phone. She must like Chiang-wei. Wang Chiang-ta, you are a man. You shall take responsibility. Don't be arrogant. I hate myself. Yes. I am a bravado big cat, a gutless lion. I’m a coward to tell you the words of my heart. I use math to work it out that it's impossible to be with you. I will wish you happiness. Use math? Are you the math teacher at that time? You again? It's really you. Yes. -Hi. -Hi. Did I disturb you again? Whatever. Actually, some guy always come here to shout like you, so I always record some surprise voice. It's one of the joys of my work. Why are you here all alone? I'm alone. But you got improvement. You brought out your feelings this time but it makes sense, unlike last time. Nonsense? Yes. Because our voice has its expression. We express our feelings naturally. It's so valuable. You are really like those boring numbers. It's really a failure. I think math is very natural. You think in this world... everything is related to math. People understand the natural by math. Let me ask you about bird migration. Do they calculate the date first and migration later? Of course not. They don't calculate at all. They just know it. You are a lion not living in the forest. No. I am determined. There's no need to calculate. -Just put it here. -Okay. It's the last one. Tieh. I think... it's better to let you live in your room. I should live in a utility room. Don't be like that. The point is you get used to living here as a prosecutor. Sometimes, I'll work day and night. Sometimes, I can sleep in military bed at the office. It's okay. So, you're welcome to live here. But if it's like this, I should let myself sleep well. Stop. Don't be like that. If I feel tired, I can sleep in Chiang-ta's room. I can sleep with him. If you are tired, you can sleep with me. Are you serious? What？ I didn't say anything. What happened? Just a delusion. Luckily, I didn't forget myself. So hot... Are you still awake? -Tieh. -What? Let me ask you... Chiang-ta used to never come home very late like today. Why are you suddenly... You care about him? Don't worry. He's a judo master in high school. He can beat ten people. What I'm worried about is not his safety. I just feel that he's weird today. Sometimes, he‘s unfriendly. Sometimes, he's so gentle. Just like we know each other a moment ago. He's naturally weird. Don't care about him. Does he have something he's worried about? That's because of the Dark Queen. What Dark Queen? It's... That... -Say it... -Say... Well, actually... It's his secret. I can't tell you I was almost beaten by him last time. So, if you wanna know, you can ask him. Secret? Chiang-wei, let me tell you something... What? Could you please be my girlfriend? You are silly. Why joke at this time? I'm serious. Do you think I'm joking? Yes. You always make jokes. But this joke is not funny at all. So I tell you these things very seriously but you think I am joking? Besides, you say it because you wanna avoid the topic of Dark Queen. Right? I see. I'm so impulsive. -Yes. You are. -And I... Wrong timing. You can forget it. I'll tell you in a more serious way, you can feel my heart. Dark Queen. Chiang-wei... What happened? You are just like in another world. Let's go. Loyal fans, you make me fall in love with this brand. The bag with graphic sense. Stylish and comfortable shoes. Who doesn't like it? That one is great too. This is so cute. Store manager. -Hi. -Hi. I want to buy this bag. -Okay, may I help you with that? -Yes. Just help me to put the old one in. -Okay, of course. -Thanks. Thanks. If you know there's no result. will you keep going? It's depend on the definition of result. If it's love, the process of falling in love is more important than the result. I suggest that you keep going. But love is a two-way road. Solo endeavor is not going to work. You are right. Although love can not be forced, it will not come without any cause. Just follow your heart. I'll cheer for you. What are you doing? Is that Sherlock? He's your loyal fan. Yes. But he's weird. He keeps on disappearing before finishing the conversation. Su Fei. Did you have this feeling? Like... A guy who's so mean and arrogant but... you always take care of him. Our Dorothy. You are falling in love. You think so? Boss. Senator candidate Lien Chong-yen will donate his collection for auction. Earnings from the auction will be donated to charity. Therefore, the sponsor suddenly requested for a press conference. So many important people will be there so security will be tight. You will definitely come there again. -See, again, Mrs. Lien. -Long time no see... -Long time no see. How are you? -Mr. Lien. May I ask that if you are here alone? I have my daughter here. -Your daughter? -Yes, you can see her later. Looking forward to it. -Mr. Lien, the famous paints you donated -Yes. -Is for auction today? -Yes. Of course, absolutely. Looking forward to it so much. Who's that? So beautiful. So gorgeous. My daughter. Your daughter? Your daughter is very pretty. -Of course. -Yes. Hi, Mrs. Lien. I am... What are you doing? I've told you it's so rude! -Are you okay? So sorry. -I'm fine, really fine. What happened, my sweety? Ask your bodyguard. He‘s working for me. So, he just wanna protect you. Dear, don’t be angry with him. -You are really unkind. -Sorry. I really don't like it. Mr. Lien. Your daughter is really nice. So pretty. She dresses up to be here for her daddy today. Would you mind letting me take a picture? -Not at all. -Thanks. There you go. I don't wanna push you, but there are few benefits for a politician. A pretty daughter is a plus forever. Boss. I go first. I'm so sorry. Thanks for your coming. This place... Why are you guys here? Oh, my goodness! You are so beautiful. -Thanks. -Pu-fan, Tieh Pu-fan. Thank you, the most handsome prosecutor, Teacher Si-te. You are so beautiful today. Thanks. Never mind, don't have to push yourself. Never mind. The material of this fabric is good. This is the best praise from your mouth. What happened? Your friends? Introduce them to me. This is Tieh Pu-fan. He's a prosecutor. Nice to meet you... Lien Chong-yen. I've heard so much about you. I've seen you on TV. Nice to meet you. This is Wang Chiang-wei. This is Wang Chiang-ta. They are my colleagues. -Nice to meet you. -Glad to see you. He's my father. Of course, you got family name of Lien. The auction is about to start. Please take your seat. We go first. Every well-known guests and friends from the media. The press conference is about to start. Let's welcome Mr. Lien Chong-yen. AUCTION OF JIA DE NIGHT Thank you, host. Mr. Lien Chong-yen. May I ask why did you donate the valuable antique? I hope my crude remarks may draw forth capable people, drive everyone to join us to help our disadvantaged groups. Thanks. I'm in. I see it... It's so convenient. Yes. Some bidders are not convenient to be on site. They can monitor the situation through webcast. Let me see... My auction lot is number two. Yes, in the process... Hope I can sell it for a good price or it will be a trouble. The first lot... Jade bracelet. You've got the detailed information. 500,000. 500,000. Second, one million. -One-point-two million. -One-point-two million first. On point two million second. Last chance. Congratulations, bidder number 22. The number 2 auction lot is... Ancient Lion Paperweight! Ancient Lion Paperweight? What's the matter？ That... That is Old Yen's item. Old Yen? What's wrong with his item? Nothing. He just sold his item. It's his right, But it's possible that this is the other one. That is this ancient lion paperweight 800,000 800,000 first 800,000 second Last chance Congratulations, bidder number 7 Great... Where did you buy this paperweight? Who sold this to you? I don't know. Fortunately, it is sold. Next. I should sale that painting That is the painting. The collection of family Wang. But it's not expected that this painting didn't get damaged after that fire disaster. After so many years, it has appeared again. The seller must be related to that case. Wang Chiang-ta, I've told you nothing is absolute. Every honored guest... The donor of this painting is also Mr. Lien Chong-yen The proceeds will be donated to charity Wang Chiang-ta, don't be impulsive. Even if the seller is the father of Si-te, you can't be sure he's related to that case. I know, but it's a clue at least. Starting price is three million, 500,000 per bidding. Let's start now. Five million. Take it easy. We have auxiliary power. The power will recovered soon. Chiang-ta, what happened? Have no idea. It's too long. It should be checked. -The painting is gone. -Security... -It's gone. -Could it be stolen? Don't call the security. Call the police, hurry! I am a policeman. I am a prosecutor. Don't be silly. Attention, please. Just stay right where you are. Fei, call for reinforcements. Control every exit. Don't let anybody out. -Don't let anybody out. -Hurry! Copy that, Boss. Attention, please. Please show your certificate and cooperate with the investigation. CHANG-TAI TUTORIAL CLASS CHOOSING CHANG-TAI WILL GIVE YOU A BRIGHT FUTURE -Prosecutor Tieh. -Yes. The conference hall is completely controlled. Nobody and no items out. The lots for auction at offstage are normal. Pay your attention to people on site. Affirmative, Sir. -Prosecutor Tieh. -Yes? It's clear after checking and registering. Can you let everybody go first? It will be a waste of time for everybody. I can't, because the thief is still in here. Based on my analysis, the duration is less than one minute and the police and security are on site. So, he must be still here. I can't escape. Please give me your solution. Find the thief, and find my painting. -Or you shall let them go. -Mr. Lien. Are you hoping that everybody stays here to watch you play Policeman and Thief? Don misunderstand it, Mr. Lien. These are necessary processes. It shall be finished and it won't be illegal. Daddy, don't be like that. They have their principle. -Yes. -No, I don't. I am just discussing with the prosecutor. -Yes, what about a cup of tea? -I know. Fei, make a tea, please. Just wait a moment, okay? Si-te's father seems so angry. What can we do? Although the thief is meticulous, time is a problem. He must still be here. Tell Fei to come here. Kuan Ching-ching. Reporter. Yes, you are... I'm Wang Chiang-ta. May I check your personal belongings? Why? I find your nail painting so eye-catching. You do not look like a reporter. Come on. The reporter now is not conservative. Could you please tell me how your right hand got hurt? Why is there no bandage? I guess... it was cut by a knife while you were stealing. Good eyesight. Thanks for your attention. It's just a minor injury. Not a big deal. But I remember that... -Sorry. -You took pictures around the place. You didn't seem to care about the auction but the topography of the place. You didn't interview anybody during the auction. But your tripod bag may just contain the stolen painting. So, you suspect that I am the thief. Are you kidding me? Excuse me, ma'am. I am a policeman. Please cooperate with our investigation. Please open your bag. All right. I am a good person. Cooperation with the police is just a normal thing. What are you doing? What's this? Awesome! You caught me. You are Wang Chiang-ta, right? Kuan Ching-ching, you can't run. You can chase me. Catch that silly woman! Watch out! Fei! Catch her! On fire... -On fire... -No. It's just smoke, not fire. Wei, here we go. Hsiao Wei! Take it easy. It's okay. I'm here. I'm here. Chiang-wei, it's okay. Chiang-wei, it's okay. The power is back on. Stand up. Okay. It's okay. -Chiang-ta. -Fei. I just received a message. She's at the emergency staircase. -Okay, I'll be there. -Let's go. Chiang-wei. Let's go there together. Chiang-ta. Everybody, the exit in the first floor is secured. She shall not escape. Okay. Tieh. The gunshot just now was a fake. It was just a recording. She was making a mess and confused the public. She will have more time to run. Go for it. Fei, take some policemen. Check the floors below, upper floors are mine. Well, distribute some policemen for me. Got that, Boss. I'll go first. Chiang-ta. We can handle the rest, you just take care of her. Don't worry. Are you okay? All of the things are under her calculation of arrangement. She must has a better plan to run. -Hi. -Hi. -Hi... -What can I do for you? -Let tell you. -Yes. -I'm introduced by a friend. -Yes. I have something. He told me I can find you and tell you Chang Hua Hsiao Liao. Do you know him? -Yes, I know him. -Yes. -So... -This is an antique painting. -An antique painting? -Can you identify it? Okay. I wanna sell it. Okay. Let me identify it. This is a painting of Bo Yi. Why is it that all of a sudden all of the items of the Wang family come out? How about it? Not bad? How much is it worth? It's so complicated to say, but I have some friends who are very interested in an antique painting like this. I suggest you leave this painting here. I can give you a deposit. Anybody here? Are you looking for me? You are a thief! Not a murder. You can try. If she gets this injection, she will be a dead woman. Wang Chiang-ta. Okay, let's stay where we are. You seem to take care of her. Are you a couple? No. No? Your eyes are telling me something. If you are not a couple, she is someone you care about. Really? Wang Chiang-ta. You are a smart man. I'm looking for a man who deserves my heart. I really hope I can meet you at a right time. Kuan Ching-ching. You are also a smart person. You might be smart enough to know that you have my words. Only if you let her go, I will let you go. Chiang-wei. Your name is Chiang-wei? I'm so jealous of you. You see? In order to save you, he's bargaining. You have three minutes to go. Wang Chiang-ta. You are a smart, confident, and credible man. I guess I will never forget you. You have two-point-five minutes to go. But it's unfair if I'm the only one who won't forget you. You shall never forget me. I have no answer for a question I asked you last time. If you agree to date me, I will let you know. You seem to be curious about Wang Chiang-ta's feeling. Why am I so nervous? Teacher Si-te got an anonymous letter. Who is slandering me? It's not a simple case. If it's an explosion, the whole building will disappear. Now you're dealing with me like this. I think it's unfair. This man is Chan Ting-hsuan. You can say goodbye to your life. Fei must find Chan Ting-hsuan. We can't let him detonate it.
