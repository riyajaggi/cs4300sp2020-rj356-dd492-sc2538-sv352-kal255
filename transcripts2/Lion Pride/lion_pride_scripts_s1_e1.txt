 It's dangerous to be under the fairway. That criminal was caught in the act. Fei, turn on the siren and go! You on the bike! Stop! It's the police! Get closer! Wang Chiang-ta, stop! I know you can hear me! It’s the police! Stop right there! Stop! Wait! Damn. What are you looking at? Keep driving. That's weird. Where is that guy? Over there! There!

 He’s there! Go! Don't move! This is the police! Hurry! Shit. Everyone, don’t move! It's the police. Male on the left, female on the right. The guy writing, face against the wall! TITLE: PROSECUTOR NAME: TIEH PU-FAN What? I practiced that line a lot. It's not a big deal. You can raid the hotel. It’s faster. What's the rush? Using the siren on the road, using of public utilities for personal needs. It’s not personal. It’s an emergency. We have the call history of a drug gang, but the drug dealer purposely used a secret signal. All we know is that the transaction will be today. As for the specific time and date, we're still not sure. What about their mobile location? They don't use mobile phones because they are too cunning. Well, then why are you asking me? I have a recording and I want you to listen to it. I'm hoping you can discover their location. And I also know that the vendor is called Black Devil. Based on my investigation, it’s associated with the case from that year. What happened to you, Daddy? Wake up! Daddy! I hear the sound of a car engine. There's nearby traffic lights and a pedestrian crossing. I can hear door chimes from a 7-Eleven store. Wait, there's also a FamilyMart. I can hear a siren from a fire station nearby. When a fire truck leaves the station, the siren is turned on. The secret codes that come up the most are "hen" and "egg," indicating money and drugs. "Finish before the little kids appear." Turning the cup upside down is the secret signal. There's a middle school or high school nearby. Time is anywhere between 4:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. in a café. Awesome. Thank you, Chiang-tada. Thank you so much. Hey. Fei. Now, what you're going to look for is a place where 7-Eleven and FamilyMart are both located. Then, look for a café that's near a fire station and a middle or high school. So, how do you know this Black Devil is associated with the cases? I can't tell you the details, but I can let you know that this Black Devil used to hang around with Chan Ting-hsuan. Are you resigning? Just because of the joke I posted on the internet? It's not serious, let me tell you that. I can come forward to clarify that I posted it myself. I have decided. Hey? Yes. Okay, I got it. Three potential locations found. We'll look separately. So will I. Please let the professional do the arresting, okay? You wait here. Wait for me here. Don't move. Be nice and wait for me. Yes. You can come here to take me now, okay? I won't wait. Did you get the shot? Which one is Black Devil? You sure it's here? Have you checked the other two locations? One is an empty restaurant. -The other is a café... -Okay. Take pictures of all the customers -then upload it to my tablet. -Okay. -Brother Chiang-ta. -Why are you here? -What's going on? -I told you let the professionals handle it... We are confirming which one is Black Devil. A man of about 40 years old. He should be alone, drinking only one cup of coffee. Ms. Sun. Ms. Sun. This jade plate cicada is authentic. Perfect tactility and fabulous color. It will be worth 10,000 dollars if sold to a genuine collector. You truly are an expert in identifying antiques. Let me show you something more valuable. My lover told me this cost him 1.35 million dollars. Please help me check. What's wrong? Is there a problem? Ms. Sun, I'm going to be frank. We have an issue with this jade bracelet. The quality is not high. That's impossible. Please check again. You must be wrong. Please check it again. All right, let me check it again. Fei. That's him, he’s the Black Devil. -Okay. -Okay? Hurry up and go. Don't wait. Attention everyone, we need to move now. What's the matter? Can you be careful? Are you blind? What if the coffee spilled? Sir, can you be careful? You should apologize. -Something is wrong. -Hey! You are such a rude guy. If the items on the table broke, you wouldn't be able to afford to pay it. You look shady. Dangerous. CINEMA WORLD GONE WITH THE WIND The jade bracelet! -B, bring the suspect back. -Copy that. Tie, where's the Black Devil? He ran away. Fei is chasing him. Don't worry. -What's the matter? -Don't go! You broke the jade bracelet. You must take responsibility. Can I have a cup of coffee? Thanks. I broke your jade bracelet? Yes. Miss. If it wasn't for me, you would be in the hospital right now. You should be thanking me instead of blaming me. If you hadn't come to save me, I would have saved the bracelet from being broken. So, you shall take half of the responsibility! Are you a swindler? I... Hey! Miss. I was just helping you, but I never touched the jade. There's nothing to negotiate. And I'm in a hurry. You... Where are you going? You have to pay me! You have to pay me! All right, don't be like that. It's just rude. Let's go to the police station. Who are you? Tieh Pu-fan, I'm a prosecutor. -I want to accuse him! -I want to accuse her! Let's go to the police station and file. Come on. Are you going to talk or not? Police officer, I told you what I know. Who the hell is this Black or White Devil? I also suffered large losses. Can I apply for state compensation? You must be kidding. Ms. Sun. I'm not refusing to pay for it, but I think this man should also take half of the responsibility, shouldn't he? Besides, your jade is an A-grade replica. It's not worth 1.35 million dollars because of the quality. What are you talking about? Prosecutor, you can judge. She broke my jade bracelet. Now, she's trying to fool me like that. It's unfair. Ms. Sun, I'm not fooling you. It's true. This jade has a quality issue. Stop acting cool. We'll handle the situation well. About this jade... I think you are right, this man shall take some of the responsibility. Say something. Sir. Ms. Sun. You can send the jade to a third party for verification. It's not necessary to make a big deal out of it. You guys think you're Bonnie and Clyde? I'm not scared of you. I will make a big deal out of it. All right, I will be frank. Except for your two thumbs, there are different ring marks on the rest of your fingers, which means you always wear rings. And that's because you go out with different people. The bag you're carrying today is about 100,000, but the shoes you're wearing is just average. It seems old too. Since you have no other plans after meeting with Ms. Wang, so you brought an expensive bag to show off and not care about other problems. Why do you talk so much? You have many expensive, branded items. However, you also have many average items because you have to show men that you are just average in order to ask for money. Someone gave you a 1.35 million jade, and you asked her for identification, which means that you only cared for the money. -Hey, prosecutor. -Hey. How much longer does he need to talk? Ms. Sun, I advice you not to make a big deal out of the situation. There are so many journalists in the police office, it's not good for you if things come out in public. I... I just want justice. Okay. The professional that you personally invited is right here. Please, let us know how much this jade is worth. This is a natural Burma jade, but it's not in perfect condition. -This is only worth 200,000 dollars. -What? One more thing, that was before it was broken. Okay, 200,000 dollars. Any question, Ms. Sun? Hey, are you kidding me? If you think that's not enough, I think it's better if we send it to a third party for verification. But, you know, with all the recent news online, it might not be a good idea. You guys are pushing me too far. All right, -500,000. -200,000. -400,000. -190,000. -300,000. -180,000. Give me 200,000 or I'll die. -Okay, 200,000. -All right! Now that everyone's happy, let's go and sign the agreement. Harmony brings wealth, there's no need to be mad at each other. Come on, sign it. Fei, make some tea! Come here. You are Party A and you are Party B. Here, sign this. Okay, I give up. Are you leaving? What about your tea? You... Fei, cancel the tea! What a bummer. Prosecutor, you must secure justice for me. This man must take half of the responsibility. The bracelet becoming broken was a probability issue. Why should I be responsible? -You... -All right. Ms. Wang, let me handle this problem Mr. Wang, I think you... What's up, Tie? Please call me prosecutor. You did break the jade bracelet when you saved Ms. Wang. So, Ms. Wang has the right to ask you -to take some of the responsibility. -Yes. -Take some of the responsibility? -Yes. Based on my calculation, even if I did not rush to help save you, the percentage of that bracelet not becoming broken is less than 10%. Well, why don't you ask a fortune teller? Well then, there's still that 10%. She's a young lady, you must be gentle to her. I just helped her to reduce the compensation from 1.35 million to 200,000. It means, I helped you save 86%, which is more than the 10%. Oh, really? Let me calculate that. You really want to calculate? What about the nonsense you posted on the internet? I didn't calculate that. Chiang-ta. Where is he? Mr. Wang, the problem is quite difficult. Please help me. Even my tutor can't solve this. It's so difficult. If there's any tutorial class that can solve this, I will attend there. You can find me when you find any information about Black Devil. Things are not solved. Where are you going? Prosecutor. How could he be irresponsible? Actually, this thing is not related to Mr. Wang directly -We can’t let him stay here. -You should have stopped him. This is about 0.2 million! We are classmates, good friends and also roommates for years. I'll persuade him. Okay. I'm counting on you, prosecutor. Just call me Tieh Pu-fan. Also, you can call me Hsiao Tieh during regular hours, and you can just call me Tie after 12 o'clock midnight CHANG TAI TUTORIAL CLASSES DIRECTOR YEN CHANG-TAI Girl, here. What happen to your feet? Well, just a fender bender. Don't worry. Look there, Professor Wang. This video can prove that the problem was solved by our student. It became crazy popular among all of the tutorial classes after this video was uploaded to the internet. Everyone congratulated me for being this good teacher. No, master. The phone was busy all day. Who is this student? Student? I don't know. He won't show his face intentionally. If Professor Wang can teach here, this student will be discovered. I'm interested in this student. Really? Trust me. I'll keep the promise on the internet. That's great. You can teach the graduating class. -But, I'll only teach for one session. -What? Professor Wang, let me tell you about your salary, I won't treat you unfairly. Don't be inflexible. It's not about being inflexible or not. It's about if it's possible or impossible. Okay... You are right, Professor Wang. This thing is about yes or no. This is not a university and I'm not here to give a speech. So, please don't call me professor. Teacher Wang. Girl, hand that over. The, you know... Of course I know. Teacher Wang. This printing is great, isn't it? Great! LIGHTWEIGHT RAINCOAT RECONCILIATION AGREEMENT It's better to set a lower excepted salary. It's that man. “The greatest math teacher on earth is enrolling students. Wang Da Qaing?" What a funny name. "Taiwan Fields Medal winner, professor of mathematics in a university. He has rejected and join Chang Tai unprecedentedly. He's a teacher in tutorial classes. What a sinful guy, and an irresponsible cheapskate. You are down, Chiang-tada. Come out and enjoy this late snack. I bought a late snack for you, Chiang-tada. Hey! Come out, food addict. You are awesome. How could you insist on the same snack shop everyday? I like it but I don't eat it everyday. Can you be more precise? You pursue preciseness and probability on everything. It's really exhausting. Preciseness will decline the probability of fail substantially and it can save your time and energy. Anyway. What about Black Devil? Pity. The man we arrested doesn't know Black Devil. Furthermore, it was just a normal trade. This line is gone. Well, forget it. It's better to be flexible. Don't be stuck on that case. Let me give you a drink. I’m never stuck on anything, except for chopsticks. There you go, food addict. The fruit juice will help you calm down. You finished all the snacks. Prosecutor. -The clue is up to you. -Okay. You did not wait for me to have a snack. I did not wait for you. Find the clue. "Find the clue." GREAT TEACHER CHANG TAI TUTORIAL CLASSES GREATEST LINEUP COVER EVERYTHING GREATEST MATH Excuse me, I want to see Wang Chiang-ta. You need wait in line downstairs for the audition. I'm not a high school student. Of course I know. But it's the same for the parents. Queue and register. Audition is at night. Audition is at night? But, the line is too long. It even reach the road. Of course I know. Teacher Wang Chiang-ta is a famous math teacher that we hired with high a price. Normal people may not know him, but he is famous in the math community. Okay. What can I do? It will be at night. What about seeking help from the prosecutor? But he is weird. I'd better find Wang Chiang-ta directly. Niu Niu, prepare more application forms. The applicants will be a lot. Understand? Okay, you need to be careful, boss. Your feet are not well. What? Just one foot got injured. All the rest are normal. What a gorgeous picture. Yes. When I first saw this painting, I was just like you just now. The inexplicable emotion from my heart. So, I decided without hesitation. Whatever it's worth, I must buy it. Furthermore, look. It's definitely authentic. It's worth the price and worth investment. It's the copy. Well... The copy? But, it's definitely not the forgery. Because the artist who painted it, -kept his spirit. -No... About this point, it can be identified from some details But... Can you ensure it? Daddy, what are you drawing? Hsiao Wei. Daddy is trying to figure out the state of mind of the painter. Then, I draw it with my own brush. I see. Then, we can communicate with the spirit of the ancients. Understand? So, it was considered as authentic at first glance. But, the painter of the copy kept his style in the details. Ask for identification. It can be ensured. I... I bought a fake painting, and hung it on the door, I... It's not the fake. It can speak to you. You can communicate with the spirit of it and you will be moved. It's true. That's all that matters. What this silly girl said means that she likes it so much. Perhaps I can resell it to her at a high price. Boss, the history teacher that was initially scheduled -will not come here today. -Won't come here, why? She is taken by the World Tutorial Classes. What? In my original plan, Wang Chiang-ta should join us today. Our team of Chinese, English, Math, Sociology and Natural Science is complete. Now, it's Incomplete. What can I do? Only a situation when things come to an end. Damn, wicked and shameless Li Ta-shih! Nevermind. I think someone is speaking ill of me. What can we do now? No... Let me think twice, okay? My god, could it be the job opportunity that God designed? This boss is the soulmate of my daddy. I can find Wang Chiang-ta conveniently and deal with him If he doesn't take responsibility, I'll ask boss for a deduction in his salary directly. Excuse me, boss. Let me introduce myself. My name's Wang Chiang-wei. Coincidently, I am a history teacher in high school Of course, Geography is also under my control. I taught in a high school with seriousness and warmheartedness, obtained positive feedback from whole school. Especially from students. They were so cute. They had quick responses in class. They were so happy when I correct their papers. After class, they would also ask questions around me. Their test scores were very good. But, the environment like this is too comfortable. I want to display my talent in competitive tutorial classes. Unexpectedly and coincidentally, you are looking for history teacher. If you think I can handle it, I desire to obtain this opportunity so much. My god. Could it be a chance that I can resell the fake to her? I hire her and I can resell that fake painting to her. If she has no money, I can deduct her salary. You are hired, welcome in. -Really? -Yes. Welcome in, please prepare. Pilot teaching is tonight. Niu Niu, put her picture on the poster. Of course I know. Teacher Wang, please give me your picture. Okay. Thank you, boss. -Come on! -Come on! Are you sure that Wang Chiang-ta will pass from here? Sure. He's coming. Over there! Please check this out. World Tutorial Classes. Can you really handle it? Let me show you. Hi. I'm Li Ta-shih. World Tutorial Classes. You should go forward. Understand? Great. I'll take this chance very well. Watch out! -Sorry, I'm in a hurry. -It's okay. Report. The guy who traded with BD doesn't know the trace of BD. I think so. BD is really careful and cunning. It's not easy to catch him. However, there's one more suspect. Need to tail him? Wow, you don't just have a pretty face, you are getting an epiphany. Now you can investigate this suspect I have not taught you anything. Who's that guy? Clue is in there. This... After looking through these pictures, and thinking it over... I found that Ms. Chiang-wei was near the BD. BD could overturn any table, but BD just overturned the table of Ms. Chiang-wei. I think Ms. Chiang-wei must know something. Your face and the name of Ms. Chiang-wei from your mouth make me sick. Are you there for the clue or the girl? -What does that mean? -"What does that mean?" By the way, you lost one close-up, lips compressed. Very cute. What does that mean? You took it. Give it to me. Boss, I didn't. Are you sure? You will be a dead man, if I find out. All right, I'll go first. -Do you have it? -The picture was printed by myself. -If you want... -You'll be dead if you find out. You have to print it by yourself. What if you help me print one more? Can I help you? Ham and eggs and a cup of green tea. That is Teacher Wang Chiang-ta. He has a class today. Yes, he's so handsome. Let's order a meal first. Sir, your ham and eggs. -Thanks, please enjoy. -Thanks -Professor Wang, bye! -Professor Wang, bye! He's a golden bachelor. He is so handsome. Professor Wang and Teacher Wang are the same math teacher. Wherever they teach, the strong power is from meals and drinks. Perhaps, the courage is trying something that you never do. Does your kid have the audition of Wang Chiang-ta Teacher tonight? Yeah, my kid is looking forward to his class. He is awesome. Yeah, someone waiting in line for a long time... Yes. Teacher Wang, this way. WELCOME HISTORY TEACHER WANG CHIANG-WEI JOIN US What a large classroom. "Wang Chiang-wei." Boss Yen really does recognize my talent. I must work hard. Unbelievable. Look, look at this. The salary of a new comer. Is it really necessary? He considers us as air now? Air and nothing, right? Teacher Si-te, what do you think? Teacher Si-te? What are you afraid of? Don't be afraid, if you are strong enough. Good point. Sometimes, I think Teacher Yan is... Hurry! Teacher Wang Chiang-ta is coming soon. Everybody came here to welcome our newcomer, okay? -Come on, Si-te, go... -Old man, we are old friends. -Listen... -I tell you, good mood is based on great strength provided by many hands. Old Kuo? Where are you? Hurry. Old man, I think the newcomer... Hey? Yeah, okay. Yes. Ordered a hundred. One hundred apple pies. Students and parents are here. You hurry, take drinks. Hi, everybody. Welcome to my audition. Let me introduce myself first. My name's Wang Chiang-wei. My Wang sounds like barking, Chiang-wei means the beautiful rose. What's wrong? My god. Get off, hurry. Get off? Watch out! Don't soil the red carpet! Carpet? Don't. What's that on blackboard? Southern and Northern Song Dynasty? Niu Niu, hurry to clean the blackboard! You made a mistake. This classroom is not for you! How could you make a mistake? Boss, what's going on? Sorry, audiences for audition of history are not that much. So, this classroom is not for you. -But... -I know. Niu Niu, I clean the blackboard. You take Teacher Wang to the next classroom, okay? -Of course I know. -Teacher Wang, this way. Okay, let's start. I... Okay, wait a moment. I clean the blackboard, I clean. Teacher. Can you teach us sooner? I want to check if there are available seats in math class after this. -Math class? -Me too, because math class is so popular. Okay. This classroom is smaller. I will just teach you guys by speech. Seems awkward. All right, let me tell you a joke. Taiwan has black bear, Sichuan has giant panda. The question is... What hospital has? Let me tell you. The answer is Neuropath. Isn't it funny? Wang Chiang-wei. It's just a first day. You will be better and better next time. You can change a joke. It's not a big deal. Come on! WELCOME TO THE GREATEST MATH TEACHER ON EARTH. GREAT TEACHER CHANG TAI TUTORIAL CLASSES GREATEST LINEUP COVER EVERYTHING -Teacher is coming. -Teacher is coming? So handsome. Everybody, Teacher Wang Chiang-ta! WANG CHIANG-TA I'm Wang Chiang-ta Are you ready? This Wang Chiang-ta. He's really that good? Excuse me, let me pass. Excuse me. Excuse me, let me pass. Excuse me... Excuse me. This time... -Teacher Wang Chiang-wei. -Just divide its base.. Come. Attention. Good. Into endless part... Teacher Wang, you see... Every student is taking notes. Why? Because they know it's a privilege that the master like Professor Wang can come here to teach them. When a thing is rare, it becomes precious. See? Students are concentrating on learning. This is the difference between elite and normal teacher. It's true. It's really different from active learning and cramming. I‘ll expand elite classes. More charge. Attention. This starting point. What is this? Set an end point in here. Tell me what it is? From birth to death, if the things accumulated happened at all of the time points... LIFE It's the life of everybody. Furthermore, each of us have a different point in life. We have different value theories. At this time point, what is the most important for you? Someone might think it is money. Someone might think it is achievement. ACHIEVEMENT What do you guys think about it? Personally, I think the summation of results obtained. RESULT At each time point is my life. Okay, let's begin. Any questions? I have a question. Yes, please. But it's not on the blackboard. Can I write it on the board? Yes, go ahead. This student purposely made it difficult. I've solved the problem he wrote. Very difficult. It will take a lot of time, even it's me to solve this problem. His background is definitely not pure. No problem. This is Wang Chiang-ta. He has Academia Sinica level. No worries. I can't solve it. Great. -Hsin. -What? Good job. Of course, I carefully selected this boy. Yen Chang-tai. How can you pass it over to a district depending on this Wang Chiang-ta? Li Ta-shih is here. Don't even try. Teacher Wang. You really cannot solve it? The leaflet said you are greatest on earth. I really cannot solve it. Stop it. The teacher can't solve it. Really? Because this problem is wrong. You folded the note twice. You just made a mistake. So you didn't see it clearly, right? I know that. I have confidence in Teacher Wang. Live broadcast, keep going. So, what? You shall make no exception. Just figure out my mistake directly. But you are not a student. In a normal bakeshop, a training student is not allowed to utilize an oven. But you burned your arm on the oven. Green and old wound are there. Moreover, your hand is delicate. That is caused by prolonged exposure to yeast when you knead dough. In short, you already graduated from school. And you are a trainee in bakeshop, right? No, I'm still in school. I want to go to university. Work first and then further education. It's also impossible. But if you can show your mobile phone and let me check if there is call log with tutorial classes nearby... Then, what you're saying would be more persuasive. Due to geography reasons, it's not necessary for the faraway tutorial classes. Therefore, it must be the peer company nearby. Li Ta-shih! Again. I know you must get something when you say you can't every time. Come on, tell me. Are you the spy sent by World Tutorial Classes? Let me check your mobile phone! Spare him. It's not easy to be a trainee in a bakeshop. He also needs work. I think he has secret sorrow. Sorry. Keep silence, let's move on. Awesome! He has been laughing for five minutes. Is he okay? Nevermind, his record is eight and a half minutes. So successful. You are awesome, Teacher Wang. Let me introduce to you. They are our teachers and your colleagues. First of all, let me introduce our physics and chemistry teacher, Teacher Kuo. He is cleaning now. Teacher Kuo's nickname is Honesty Kuo. But it's better to call him as Teacher. Next, let me introduce our greatest math... former greatest math teacher, Teacher Tseng Jen-i. Any question in teaching, feel free to let me know. Next, let me introduce our most beautiful and elegant English teacher, Lien Si-te. Hello. If the lady stretches out her hand, the man will do the same. This is a gentleman. “Manners Maketh Man.” Didn't watch Kingsman, The Secret Service? Sorry, I'm not used to it. You have to get used to it We are colleague now. What an arrogant man. Finally, our history teacher. Teacher Wang Chiang-wei. No need to introduce me. We know each other. Yes, didn't expect that you are a tutorial teacher. Me too, unexpected. You are the greatest math teacher on earth. You left me hanging out there after getting into trouble and didn't even take half the responsibility. Seeing is believing. Teacher Wang. It's my sixth time to tell you. The rate at that time is only 10%. You guys. One-night stand? No! You guys misunderstood. Teacher Wang Chiang-ta. I know you are a math genius. But calculating the safe period is not safe. If you want to be safe, you need... I ensure you it's not real... Wang Chiang-ta. Why you didn't you say something? You caused the trouble. You deal with it. You... Let it go. Let's hold the present, all right? Teacher Wang was really awesome today. More than a half of students on trial have paid the registration fee. It's so successful. I want to celebrate. I invite everyone to have a snack, all right? Boss, I didn't explain it clearly. -We are not... -Sorry. -I have to go, bye -Hey, Teacher Wang. This newcomer has a strong personality. I think he's really got some ability. The man with real ability has personality like that. It's arrogant. Yes. What I saw is the quality of the chosen one, the attitude of arrogance and greatness. Just like a a lion? Lion. Lion, Wang Chiang-ta. No, lion king, Chiang-ta. It's not bad and we can use it in a propaganda. I’m just a tiny plant. I will be leaving now. Teacher Wang, I didn't talk about salary and we didn't talk about your performance in the audition. But, I do really have something to do. Just one hour. One hour. I rarely invite everyone to have a snack. Let's go. Well, you never mentioned a treat. -Yes -It will be a long time if I miss it. Teacher Kuo, you are clean. I won't disturb you, we can go first. -Let's go. -Go. Cheers. Chiang-wei. Boss, let me propose a toast to you. I wanna know... Did I get the job? Here... Here's a plan. I mean, here's a plan. Anyone enrolled in elite class of Wang Chiang-ta will obtain the history class of Wang Chiang-wei for free. -"For free?" -Or a monster watch for free. Monster watch? Most student will chose monster watch. Don't be discouraged. A part of the students will chose your class. All right... What about my salary? Why are you asking this question in this place? So embarrassing. Old man. She just entered our tutorial industry. You need to be generous for her. What a nice guy. You pay her salary. Okay, you guys don't look at my phone. This. Here you go. Here you go. That's it. Can't be more. But I can give you a plan. Every one more student enrolled in your class. Your salary will increased by $500. But... The student from the math class of Wang Chiang-ta shall be deducted first. Now you can calculate, can you? Therefore, M is the total student. N is the student from that lion. She's good at math. I am good at math. Of course you are. But... You are not strong enough. Chiang-wei. Let me tell you. He does it every time. We are the same at first. As long as you become better. Your salary will be more. Okay. I will work hard. -Let me propose a toast to everyone. -Cheers. Very nice to meet all of you guys. -Okay. -Fighting, everybody fighting. Hsiao Chien said you will go to a tutorial class today. How about it? Not bad. Just teaching. Really? One is in university and this is in tutorial class. Much different? Almost the same. Furthermore, I seized a troublemaker. Why did you come back just now? My classmates know I’ve met brother Chiang. They asked me too much. I came back after drinking with them. You have to go upstairs after having some snack. Okay. Chiang-ta, only you can take care of Hsiao Chien. This is only thing I can do. I'm nothing except for this. As long as Hsiao Chien wants to learn, I'll teach her everything. But it mostly depend on her interest. Little kid took interest? Learning is everything. Eat slowly. Girls will be scared if they see you like this. He's a food addict. and he will meet... Uncle Hsun. -Hi. -Same one, Chief Cook. -Okay, please have a seat. -Hsiao Tieh. -Cute. -What did you want to say just now? What I wanted to say just now is that food addict met dark queen. Too much. Who is dark queen? Mafia? Or Chiang-ta has a girlfriend? Or a video game? Tell me, Hsiao Tieh. Well... I cook nice dishes for you. Okay, what I wanna say is, my former classmate and present roommate, besides his odd personality, he dislikes making contact with people. But he like delicious food. There's a lightless restaurant that has some good dishes. This guy went there for tasty dishes. What is unexpected is that he met the dark queen while he was eating. That is an utter darkness place. When you get in, nothing can be seen. Like blindness. All of the shining stuffs were stored by the restaurant. The server will seat you with night-vision goggles. If you are alone, it is possible to share a table with stranger. You might not know who is sitting opposite of you. But because it is dark, you will be relaxed. Without pressure. Therefore, this guy shared a table with a girl naturally. In addition, he finally got drunk. Hsiao Tieh, what's going on next? I just know, at that night, this guy was so... romantic. In a reasonable and emotional way. They had a very happy conversation. They told me everything. Congenial. Endless. Finally. -Finally? -I... I don't know. Met the right person at the wrong time. Sure enough, it's just a fairy tale. Actually, I rarely have a chance to talk too much with a stranger. You seemingly filled the missing part of my life. Really? Are you shy? Or scared? Strangers are variables. Not easy to calculate the rate. What does that mean? Life is short. Too much chaos is not allowed. But... Accident has its own beauty. There is beauty that happens by chance In the world of woman, if you love me, you should find me. In the world of man, if you love me, you won't leave me. So I won't turn around. And I won't persuade to stay. Uncle Hsun, thank you. I didn't say something. Because no matter how much I ask him, he won't say anything. But according to my many years of working experience, if this guy says nothing, he must have ulterior motives. Jackass. We met first and we can't see each other. What could happen? Really? If you are innocent, why you always go to lightless restaurant. Because the dishes there are good. Better than Uncle Hsun's dishes? -I am going upstairs now. -Okay. -Good night. -Good night. -Good night, bye. -Good night. It's 11:00 p.m. now. What you are listening to is The Midnight Starry Sky of Su Fei. We are not perfect. Now we are making great efforts. I'm Su Fei. Who's this woman for this time? What woman? It's goddess for this time. Yes. Concerning the jade issue. this trouble was not caused by you, but you got indirect relation with it. So, you should take some responsibility This goddess didn't reply after reading. Would it be Wang Chiang-wei? You think she's a goddess? -She's right to read without replying. -You... This woman is strange. You'd better stay away from her. Anyway. The police should take responsibility for the broken jade issue. If I were her, I would apply for State Compensation. Yes. The jade was broken due to the condition that we rushed into the café. She's an innocent victim. Chiang-ta. Why are you get involved in the police investigation? If something goes wrong, what can we do? Well, Uncle Hsun... Actually, I want to ask Chiang-ta for help. Chiang-ta. I still want to persuade you that you shall not fall into this situation. Uncle Hsun, it's the reputation of my father and the last wish of my mother. I cannot ignore it. So, I have to find out. So, sorry, dear listeners. I'm late due to the traffic jam. It's so late, there's still a traffic jam? What are you laughing about? She is joking. She is satirizing that traffic jam is a never-failed reason. I see. It's right? -Sick. -Sick what? I want to know how's your laughing point? Don't touch me. -Hey! -In your lower body. Good evening, dear listeners. I am Dorothy. Dorothy, you know? Everybody likes you. They ask "Dorothy, where are you going?" I'm in Taipei, of course. Don't you think about, I'm the Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz and I get lost in the Land of Oz? Yes. I want to ask a question to every listener. Do you know who likes going to the Land of Oz most? Who? The answer is a Baseball player. Why? Because they are always rushing. Then, the referee will say, "Out!" Hope everybody won't rule this joke out. Then, don't rule our radio station out. Let's listen to a good song first. How can he laugh like this by that damn joke? He likes Dorothy. No reason. I think he‘s abnormal. Well, I don't understand. Why could this Dorothy always be there as a guest? Because she's honest in an interesting way. Uncle Hsun, turn it off. Or I'll smash it. All right. What? You got a new job? I got a new job. But I’m in bad debt Actually, this Dorothy is not easy. She's a cheerful and optimistic girl. Really? She said she encountered the fire. Got a burn on her back and chest. She always shared recovery experience during Ba Xian Dust Explosion issue. So many people were moved. Cool Chiang-tada also has the emotional part. Your trash talking is too much. Just go back home if you are full. It's happy. Right? Happy is most important. You talk trash if you are not happy, right? Thanks for Uncle Hsun's good dishes. I'm leaving now. Go home. Go. You go first. Uncle Hsun, I'm leaving. When I am in bad mood, or annoyed, I will find a place where I can look at night scenes, and there are not many people there. Actually, there are so many places like that near Taipei. Like Jiannan Mountain. Or Xiang Mountain. They are not bad. Then you can shout to a distant place. Shout out the words in your heart. Then, you'll be in a good mood. Perhaps, someone may think it's too silly. But, if you are in this way, It indicate that you are a person who mind others eyes. These are the invisible pressure. Accident has its own beauty. There are so many good things which happened by accident. Let me ask you... Can you chose your parents? You can't. So... The day you are arriving in this world is a beautiful accident. What are you doing? Daddy! Only because my accident is not beautiful. It's repulsive and cruel. Wang Chiang-ta! You are a man! You shall take responsibility! Don't be arrogant! You need to be a trainee in the class of Wang Chiang-ta. Please print the other teaching materials. We will use it soon. I‘d like to sacrifice my time to listen to what you want to say. Give me your contact information. There's a spy in my tutorial class. Each of you are suspicious. I just told you that I was being followed. Can I call the police? Translated by: Wang Yan Long
