 Love makes us stupid. You should see this painting yourself. "Police officer Wang, suspected." No wonder. Chan Ting-hsuan. You are a wanted person now. How dare you walk around public places? In 1994, a fatal robbery took place at Ming Guang Road. Police officer Wang Yu-ming was suspected to be involved. He was killed in the crime scene. You are the son of the said police officer.

 No wonder you care so much for the case. You've been monitoring me. My dad died when he was investigating the case. He was not a suspect. His situation was different from a murderer like you. What's the difference? He should bear responsibility if he dares to act. I was imprisoned for 23 years for the crime I committed. I was released on parole and I lost everything. Chief's son leads a good life though. Did he pass onto you all the stolen goods, so that you can live a comfortable life? It has been 23 years, your criminal nature remains unchanged.

 How about several more years behind bars for a deeper thought? Arrest me then. I'll give in. You're in no position to accuse me. Your dad planned the robbery and even double-crossed the team. Your dad was the worst person. You're in no position to accuse me. You think too highly of yourself, you hypocrite. Trying to win an excellent professor award? Chief's son is in no position to become a teacher. What makes you think my dad was Chief? My dad was not Chief. I dare you to explain it more clearly. Your knowledge alone doesn't get to decide whether your dad was involved in the crime or not, I was one of his accomplices. I am the eyewitness. He was the criminal. You know that? Wang Chiang-ta. You're in no position to arrest me. I am in no position? Good morning. Good morning. Breakfast will be ready soon. After our breakfast, we shall go for a date. Yeah, sure. Why do you look so down? Did you sleep well? Not really. I was thinking about a math problem last night. Until now, I still can't solve it. The trouble of math wizards is different from ordinary people. No matter what, we must go for a date in the afternoon. Where do you want to go? Where to go? It has been a while since I last visited the math museum. I wonder if they have new exhibits. How about this? There is a book fair at World Trade Center. My favorite sci-fi writer is there. I want to find out what is in his mind. -Why is he so smart-- -Don't you want to go to places where ordinary couples visit? -Ordinary couples? -Yeah. Bookstore cafe? I knew you would think this way. Which is why I came up with three solutions. Over here. -A, B, and C? -That's right. Plan A. After going around, we can visit the night market to eat. It could be late though. As for Plan B, we must go out right now. Because the Lavender Cottage is located further. If we take Plan C, the time is flexible. But the program looks ordinary. I worry if we can have a good memory. Oh, my goodness. This is tougher than seven math questions in the year 2000. You can decide on it. I am fine with any plan. I will decide? If you want to watch a movie this afternoon, I know there is a nice thriller showing. What sort of thriller? It's not a horror movie, right? Is it romantic if I watch a horror movie with my boyfriend? It's a Sherlock Holmes movie. That would need a lot of thinking, we can watch it later today. After the movie, we can have a late supper. I have something to do after 6:00 p.m. I thought you promised to be with me all day long? I promised to take something from a friend's place. What friend? Do I know this person? It could be either. You know her or you don't know her. Why do you look strange? What's that smell? My toast! It's burnt! It's burnt! Are you two burning the kitchen? Is it okay? My French toast is burnt. I actually bought you breakfast. This is for you. My favorite meat and egg toast. I went out early this morning... I lined up to buy it for you. -Thank you, Brother Tieh. -You're welcome. I'll warm it up. How are you doing? I am doing well. This is for you. How about you? I'll eat out. This place is for both of you. This is preferential treatment! Unexpectedly, I became a loser in the world of love. Nobody asks me out during the weekend. I am a loner... pretending to be working overtime. How sad. Chiang-ta and Chiang-wei must be dating now. Why are you so cute? You are also very cute. -Our shaved ice is here. -Our shaved ice is here. -It looks lovely. -Let me feed you. -Sure. -Come on. -Tasty? -Yeah. -One more bite. -One more bite. Chiang-ta is such a boring person. He must be doing some of those embarrassing things. Forget it, it's none of my business. Teacher Si-te? Did you come over for coffee? No, I need to ask for a favor from you. -Okay. Please take a seat. -All right. How do you know I am here? I phoned you but you didn't answer. Fei told me you do your work here during the holidays. That damn Fei. Are you investigating the case of the soy sauce factory? That's right. If you came over to beg for mercy on behalf of your father, I can understand that. However, I will still act according to the law. I can't let go of any culprits. That's great. You mean... You're not begging for mercy? My dad has been running a business while dodging the law. He always said that his profits come from risks. I do not like how he runs his business. I worry that he would go astray. It is useless if I advise him. Si-te found her dad to be an immoral businessman. She wants to stop him from making bigger mistakes. From what I can see, Lien Chong-yen's background is not simple. Hsiao Tieh, can you stop him? I'll assist you if you can stop him. Once an investigation is initiated, we can never turn back. When I was little, my mother worried a lot every day. I didn't know why back then. When I grew up, I learned that my dad has been doing dirty tricks. I once said I don't want his money. He said I was in no position to turn away his dirty money. He said he raised me with all the dirty money. He was right though. If he is a criminal, do I have to bear the responsibility with him? Please don't think so. If your dad knows that he has a good daughter who thinks of him and shares his trouble, he will be glad. Hsiao Tieh. If someone helps bear his sin, would he get a lighter sentence? I... Don't cry. Don't you cry. I... This is... This is... I am wrong. I am no good. I made the same mistake most men did. Please forgive me. If I find the time, I will repay your kindness. I shouldn't behave like that. You are such a good girl. You worry about your family and me. I will treasure you. Don't cry. All right. Don't cry. The movie was nice. The reasoning is no tough task for you, right? As a matter of fact, it is still a movie. In real life, you won't need so much reasoning. I've almost forgotten. I have to get something from a friend's place. Who is this friend? You said I might know her. It's Kuan Ching-ching. Kuan Ching-ching? Chiang-wei, I don't want to tell a lie. Kuan Ching-ching called me several days ago. She held important details which I urgently need. You don't have to worry, okay? You know I am Dark Queen. But you are still going to meet her. What is this guy investigating? However, if you're really worried, -I might as well... -I trust you. -Really? -Yeah. You may go. Thank you for your trust. You must return home earlier. You only have three hours for the whole process. The countdown starts now. If this is the case, I can only carry you home now. Help. Put me down. Kuan Ching-ching. Kuan Ching-ching. Kuan Ching-ching. I am very busy. Kuan Ching-ching. Kuan Ching-ching. If you don't come out, I'm leaving. Kuan Ching-ching. Kuan Ching-ching! Police! -Up there. -Don't move. Stand still. Hands up. Step back. -Step back. Don't move. -Hands up, Step back. Fei. Chiang-ta? Coming. Hsiao Tieh. Why are there so many people? I am here today as a prosecutor. What do you mean? Ms. Chiang-wei, excuse me. This is the search warrant. I must do my job impartially. -Please wait for a while. -Search warrant? -What are you looking for? -Let's go. Hey. Searching... What's going on? Chiang-ta didn't come home last night. Is it related to that? Tell me. Kuan Ching-ching asked to meet up with me. Was she attacked all of sudden? The timing was too accurate. I must have been set up. Let me unlock the handcuffs. Hsiao Tieh. Did you all search Kuan Ching-ching's house thoroughly? Was there any sign of forcible entry in her doors and windows? Also, did you check her phone record? If the suspect wants to delete her call records, he might have left a thumbprint on the phone. -Kuan Ching-ching is a fighter. If-- -Chiang-ta. You are now a suspect. Please cooperate with the police investigation, before I can help you. But I didn't kill anybody. I know you didn't kill her, but all evidence points to your disadvantage. First, you are the first person to have been present at the crime scene. Second, she phoned you several times. You both had an appointment, right? I must answer your question. There were no signs of forcible entry in her doors and windows at home. According to the police's experience, they perceive the person who appears at the crime scene to be the possible murderer. Which means you all see me as the murderer? Based on what? Based on the experiences of police officers who worked on such cases. I am made a suspect for that? All you did was reasoning. You have no direct evidence, you know that? The dead police officer, Wang Yu-ming, lost NTD 600,000 in investment and kept his wife in the dark. Could he be taking risk? A police officer involved in the case. Policeman Wang had a figurine of Wang family's daughter. That means he went to the crime scene? Your husband is a corrupt police officer. Robberies and killings. His son won't be a good one too. You must trust Father. Father is no bad person. He is not evil. Definitely not. You all didn't really care for this case. Nobody wants to investigate this case properly. Whatever I say, you all just wouldn't listen. Because I am a kid. Police won't trust what a kid says. I have been telling many people. -Nobody trusts me. -Chiang-ta, calm down. I have been investigating and searching, and the truth in these 20 years-- Chiang-ta, be rational! Calm down, please. I am your good brother. I won't accuse you. I won't set you up. You cooperate with their investigation. That is how I can help you. I'm sorry. Trust me. I won't let them charge you without evidence. All right? Tell me what happened from the beginning. Tell me the details and exact timing. Hsiao Tieh, Chiang-ta has nothing to do with the murder case. -I know that. -I told you just now, right? Kuan Ching-ching asked Chiang-ta to get something from her home. Furthermore, Chiang-ta wouldn't want to kill Kuan Ching-ching for nothing. The preliminary investigation points to an argument or accident. Tieh Pu-fan, what are you talking about? Chiang-ta is always calm. He won't kill Kuan Ching-ching even if they quarrel. You knew him for years. You know him better than I do. Right? Chiang-ta is my friend and brother. I will help you. I am a prosecutor. I do my job impartially. I work according to the evidence. Please trust me. All right? I'm sorry. I was agitated just now. I understand your feeling. Big brother, I have to report to you. Chiang-wei, let me handle the case. You should go home now. I'll let you two work then. Please look after Chiang-ta. Update me again. Chiang-wei, don't worry. Before you appeared in Chiang-ta's life, he has been under my wing. Thank you. I'll leave now. Don't squat. Take a seat. -She's gone. -Big brother. There is a stealthy witness. He claims to be Kuan's neighbor. He lodged a police report anonymously. He said when the case took place, he saw a person of similar physique as Chiang-ta. That person threw something into the drain. The administration has sent someone to search for it. Great. Go to the crime scene. Check those neighbors' home where they can see Kuan's place. -And the drain. -Sure. -Check the houses one by one. -No problem. The source of the mysterious phone call was not simple. Got it, Big brother. Brother Chiang-ta, sorry to bother you. It's no problem. Hsiao Tieh and you are doing your job impartially. Tao Le-ssu has a special experience to share this evening. Fei. Can you turn it louder? -I lost my parents when I was little. -Senior, can you please. My aunt was busy working and she had no time for me. I was always alone at home. I felt so lonely. That was the time when I started to enjoy listening to radio programs. When I heard people talking, I felt like I had companions. Therefore, this is the story for those loners out there. Nobody is lonely in the world. Everybody misses someone deep in their heart. I wish you know that you are not alone. You have my company. Big Cat. Hsiao Wei. Good night. Good night. My child phoned me. Your math class hired a replacement teacher? You introduced Wang Chiang-ta as your top teacher. All right. No problem. I will give Mrs. Huang a good explanation, all right? Give me some time. All right, bye. -Oh, my goodness. -Why did you hire a replacement teacher? -Where is Teacher Chiang-ta? -Hsiao Ching, I... Teacher Wang is not coming either. Hsiao Ching, give me some time to handle this. Can't you see that I am handling the situation? All right? My... -Teacher Lien. Si-te. -Yes? I need math and history teachers. Do you have teacher friends who can take over? Math? Jen-i is not around? Chiang-ta applied for a leave. He didn't say when he's returning. -He's not coming over? -Yeah. He resigned to show solidarity with Chiang-wei? -Old Yen. -Yes. You asked the wrong person for help. I am also observing you. I might also quit before the next semester. No way. You all can't treat me this way. Hsiao Tieh, is this necessary? It makes no sense in science. This is a tradition. Walk over the fire to get rid of bad luck. Hurry and walk over it. I am tired with this posture. Take it as a real thing. I'm begging you. All right? You are something. You don't trust your brother's words, but you follow Chiang-wei's advice. We are so different. Pork knuckles noodles which is not oily. I changed to a new shop and this is the first bowl of noodles. -It looks tasty. -Everybody has one. It boosts good luck amongst friends. Uncle Hsun, I have always wanted to ask you. Why do you change the shop all the time? The previous shop had frequent brownouts and the rental was expensive, so I moved to this place. Everybody is here. Brother Chiang-ta, what's going on? Teacher Si-te said that Teacher Chiang-wei resigned. What's going on? Children should not interfere in adults' matters. Focus on your studies. One more, please. The mysterious witness lodged a police report via phone call. No update from him after the report. The police found no witness. The police suspect if the eyewitness saw the wrong person. Or you have been set up. There is another possibility. The person who lodged the police report was the suspect himself. Is Brother Chiang-ta safe now? Due to a lack of evidence, Chiang-ta is not suspected for tampering with evidence to escape. He was then released. However, you're still not cleared. Your residency is restricted and you need to report to the police station every day. That's quite troublesome. Why so? Hsiao Tieh, it is fine to do your work according to law. But I would like to investigate at the crime scene. I must prove my innocence. -Chiang-ta, don't you-- -Hsiao Tieh. You know I dislike it most when someone accuses and misunderstands me. By principle, this is impossible. And you should avoid visiting the crime scene. All right. Don't worry. I'll arrange it for you. I don't want my brother to be accused of such allegations. Thanks. You thank me now? Do you want to hug me? Dad, you were a police officer and Mr. Wang was your colleague. Did you take part in the investigation? Back then, the evidence pointed to Mr. Wang's disadvantage. Subsequently, Chiang-ta's mother told me that even she suspected her own husband to have committed crime. Chiang-ta, let me remind you. Look around but do not touch anything. Sure. Good. No door or window has been breached. We can see candles for atmosphere. Two sets of plates and utensils. Two empty wine glasses. A bottle of red wine. Kuan Ching-ching was expecting someone. From my reasoning, Kuan Ching-ching answered the door and the murderer came in. Payment is made online. -Keep your invoice. Thank you. -Thank you. You're coming. Our food has been delivered. -Really? -Take a look. -Is this your favorite food? -Yes. -Let's go. -Sure. Hold me. Which is why the police suspected Wang Chiang-ta. Does it make sense? No, this wasn't the case. Love is blind. The kitchen was clean. She didn't have many cooking utensils. But some wine glasses. Which means she was not cooking. Don't act smart. When the crime scene was cordoned off, we found delivery food box and sent them for a lab test. We found the delivery man. It should be him. The food was not poisoned. Kuan Ching-ching ordered food delivery. Payment is made online. -Keep your invoice. Thank you. -Thank you. What are you doing? The murderer knew Kuan Ching-ching ordered food. He was waiting outside to ambush when the time is right. That's right. The fact that the police came in coincidentally could prove this point. The crime took place between food delivery and my visit. The suspect must make good use of the short time gap. So that he could do something. Which also means that Kuan Ching-ching was set up and she didn't know that. Subsequently, her death trap was approaching. -That's right. -When you came here alone, did you notice something weird? The door was not locked. I walked in to look for her. Finally, I heard water flowing in the bathroom. Water in the bathtub has been sent for a lab test. The preliminary test showed no toxicity. Kuan Ching-ching died after she was hit and she fainted. The murderer placed her in the bathtub. She was suffocated to death. The murderer was sly and cruel. He threw the victim in the bathtub and spread rose petals. He then fled the crime scene. I investigated the rose petals. The murderer did not bring a rose. Kuan Ching-ching wanted to have a good time with you. She prepared it earlier. Chiang-ta, you are suspected because of your wrestling and judo background. When I came here, I turned the water tap off. I touched her carotid artery. I was sure she was dead. Meanwhile, Fei came in with police officers. Let's check her room. Has her room been tidied up? Why is it so tidy? One poker card was found. It was a diamond Jack. We checked on the card, which only showed Kuan's thumbprint. A set of poker cards was on the desk. She took the diamond and placed it on her bed. Did she leave the card to give any hint? This was not possible. The crime scene showed no sign of fighting. Various signs showed that Kuan Ching-ching was attacked and she was overpowered. I was thinking that... she did not expect herself to be killed. Let alone leaving an evidence. If it was not Kuan Ching-ching, it was the murderer. He wanted to make the crime scene look mysterious. But it doesn't seem so. I can't figure it out either. Chiang-ta, what do you think? It is never clear through a camera. You should see it yourself. But how? 7:00 p.m., tomorrow. Have dinner at my place. We'll play a quiz. She mentioned something about a quiz. What? The other one-third of the painting, was it found in the house? Not really. You mentioned that Kuan Ching-ching invited you to come over with this one-third part of Pu Hsin-yu's painting. The police searched the house, but did not find the painting. All right. We have checked the whole house. We shall not linger here. Let's go. The prince. What? In every set of poker cards, there are Jacks, Queens, and Kings. Each card represents a person. Diamond Jack represents Hector, the son of Troy. You think she left the prince on the bed on purpose? Chiang-ta, don't touch anything. This is... What is this? Your Majesty the Prince. Under the blanket. "Even if you run into the perfect girl, what is the probability of recognizing her?" I'll send it for forensic examination. So that the handwriting and thumbprints are cross-checked. Chiang-ta, good job. -Send me the photo. -Sure. Thanks. We'll call it a day. "Even if you run into the perfect girl, what is the probability of recognizing her?" Are you okay? Feeling down? I feel sorry for Kuan Ching-ching. I kind of regret it. What is it that you regret? It felt like I should have let you go on a date with her even just once. You pity Kuan Ching-ching and thus allow me to date with her. Isn't that even more saddening for her? We both keep quiet about our relationship and she'll never find out. But what's the point? Also, what do you think about the clues Kuan Ching-ching left behind? Do you have any idea? In a quick manner, you found the answer of Prince Troy. How about the second question? It's not tough for you, right? EVEN IF YOU RUN INTO THE PERFECT GIRL, WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY OF RECOGNIZING HER? But it has a few information. This quiz is quite difficult. I don't know the answer. Not that I don't want to tell you. I am okay. I feel like you both could communicate with the heart. You were well-matched in a quiz. You two treasured each other. In comparison, you and I are on different channels. I beg to differ. Reasoning and analysis are about logical thinking. Communication with the heart has nothing to do with it. Furthermore, you know that we communicate heart-to-heart. Hsiao Tieh. You know I dislike it most when someone accuses and misunderstands me. I haven't heard from you about your family members. I want to know more about you. Would you share it with me? My dad was a cop. He had a sense of justice. One day, he was killed. He was killed in a crime scene. Without any evidence, he was accused to have been involved in the case. He lost his pension, as well as his dignity. I see. No wonder you dislike it when someone misunderstands you. Back then, I was the witness of my dad's alibi. But I was a kid. Nobody trusted my words. My mother couldn't walk out of the shadow. She suddenly fell ill. Then she passed away several years later. In the following years, I was all alone. I heard from Hsiao Ching. After your mother passed away, Uncle Hsun took care of you? Yeah. Uncle Hsun was my dad's colleague. We lived close to each other. After the incident, he always came over to visit us. It can be said that Uncle Hsun is your benefactor. He raised you up unselfishly. He's the same as my aunt. Unexpectedly, we came from a similar background. Could this be fate? I raised Chiang-wei since she was little. Whether you or the police are dealing with her, please do make sure she is safe and happy. This is my utmost responsibility. Shall I tell you about my dad's role in your family's murder case? Why do I find this place to be familiar? This looks like the place I played around in when I was little. That's right. The Wang Family lived near this place. Chiang-wei must have been hanging out around this place. -Chiang-wei. -Yes? If you recall any of your childhood memory, does it worsen your illness? Don't worry. When I have a feeling, it is about a happy memory. Also, I have your company. And I am not afraid. There's a familiar feeling here. This was the place where I lived when I was little. It was renovated. After the fire accident, my parents passed away and my aunt sold the house. She brought me to live in Tainan. We didn't return anymore. Did you remember anything? That your aunt said that during the fire accident, she brought you into the house from here. Hsiao Wei, over here! Hsiao Wei! Are you okay? Relax. I am here. Come on, let's go. Open the door, please. Is anybody there? Open the door, please. Hey. Did you take a cell phone from inside? Look at your appearance. You must have taken it. Are you looking down on me? What now? You want to fight? Miss. How can you prove that this man took your cell phone? I came out and he went in. Who else could it be? If not for him. Please apologize to this man. Why should I apologize to a scum like him? Miss. Could you help me, please? The thing I gave you, you may give it to her now. Miss, cell phone. Is this yours? Without any evidence, you should never accuse anybody. Can you apologize now? Miss, your meal is ready. Thank you. Excuse me. -Thank you. -You're welcome. That lady was unreasonable. -Are you okay? -I'm fine. A teacher from the Chang-tai Tutorial Class. I am just fine. Don't worry about me. I have gotten used to it. How can I not worry? If anything bad happens to you, how am I going to explain it to your aunt? Nothing will happen. And I found myself to be improving a lot. I can better control my emotions. I don't feel the extreme mood swing anymore. Really? Because I am thinking in my heart that Chiang-ta will come to my rescue. Which is why I feel secured. Silly girl. I will rescue you. I will rescue you, wherever you are. I will fight tooth and nail to rescue you. I don't want you to suffer anymore. Do you understand? If Chiang-wei has overcome PTSD. If she has recovered, shall I tell her the role of my dad in the Wang Family murder case? Of course, my dad was innocent. But the case was still under investigation. What if Chiang-wei is troubled? Incoming call. Hello? Yes, speaking. At your home? Please send me your address. No problem. Thank you. Bye. Who is it? It's an authentication job. I need to work at a client's home. How about this? Let me go with you. It doesn't matter. Uncle Hsun introduced the client. It should be okay. You need to do your work as well. But I think that a boyfriend can pick up a girlfriend after work. We'll go on a date after that. This is the address. I'll give you a call when I finish working. NUMBER 1 LANE 128 XING YI RD. MISS CHEN. AUTHENTICATED. All right. I'll prepare for tomorrow's work. Sure. Chiang-ta. I spilled the perfume. The smell is all over the room. -Where is the electric fan? -I'll get it for you. Please open the windows for me. I think I know the contradicting points of Auntie's statement. I asked you to bring back the painting from Kuan Ching-ching. But you killed her. You created such a big mess. What if the police found the painting and drag me in the case? Why are you so foolish? Kuan Ching-ching was smart and sly. I tailed after her for days and set tapping device. But I heard nothing. She said she wanted to pass the painting to Wang Chiang-ta. I don't think she kept it at home. The painting was hidden somewhere. How could she bring it around? Which was why I interrogated her. Kuan Ching-ching was too stubborn to disclose any information. And I made a mistake. Let me ask you. What do we do now? Since Kuan Ching-ching is dead now. It is simple. Even if the police found the painting, they can't prove the one-third of the painting is related to you. At this critical moment, let me ask you, do I still stand a chance in the Legislative election? Forget it. You can't do a lot of thinking. Big brother, may I ask you something? The cop who died in the earlier years. Was he the chief? Stay away from some matters. Mind your own business. Also, do not interrupt Yen-pa. If you create more trouble and drag me in, I will have no choice but to eliminate you. Am I clear? You guys are leading a good life. I am the one who is suffering. Is this fair? An audit of the accounting records showed unidentified capital flow. Particularly, a company named Hui Teng Company. In the past three years, they supplied all materials to the soy sauce factory. I know Hui Teng. I'll follow you guys. I think I can help out. Prosecutor Tieh, hang on. Is she interfering... I trust Si-te. We'll go together. -Come on, let's go. -Sure. -Hsiao Tieh. -Chiang-ta, you came just on time. Do you remember the statement given by Auntie? I can recall it. Did she say that -the firefighters broke in? -Big brother. Chiang-ta, we're following another case. Let's go together. Let's discuss in the car. -Let's go. -Ms. Si-te. I can recall it. What about her? Police. Are you Mr. Hu Yao-hui? Yes, sir. How may I help you? Your company is the supplier - of the soy sauce factory? -That's right. We received reports. Take a look. Soy sauce factory melts yellow beans with industrial hydrochloric acid. Industrial hydrochloric acid is supplied by your company? Yes, sir. What's the problem? You knew they are a food factory. But you supplied them industrial hydrochloric acid. This doesn't make sense, right? Who knows if -they are for cleaning toilets. -What nonsense. -You need that much to clean toilets? -You ask the factory then. -Why do you ask me? -You... Fei, they could be using it to clean toilets. Mr. Hu. At my dad's home and office, I saw you and Factory Director Luo discussed this matter. You knew what was going on, right? You are... I am Lien Si-te, Lien Chong-yen's daughter. You are Lien Chong-yen's daughter? -And you... -If you cooperate with us and provide accounting books, when the court verdict is out, I might help you apply for a lighter punishment. Do you have a search warrant? We're applying for it. There's nothing I can do about it. These are our commercial secrets. Without evidence and search warrant, you may leave now. Mr. Yao-hui. Yao... Big brother, he is arrogant. Businessmen nowadays have crossed the line. They do all tricks to make profits. What is the most frustrating matter? We can do nothing without a search warrant. What to do now? Is there any method? I must stop my dad. Chiang-ta. How do we prove that Hui Teng knew the soy sauce factory uses industrial materials? Generally speaking, between two companies, they have cash flow and goods delivery. As for industrial materials, the Production Department should have some clues. It goes back to square one. We don't have direct evidence. I can't apply for a search warrant from the court. That's right. Production Department. I inspected with my dad. Someone may still know me. We might be able to get some evidence. You know that? -You are... -I have something to do. I will make a move now. We can give you a ride. It's okay. I can ride a taxi. -You can all leave now. -All right. -Take care. -Sure. Bye. Ms. Si-te, bye. Are you close with her? Start the engine now. What are you doing? Big brother, what's wrong with you? -Fei. -Brother Chiang-ta, anything? Please pull over at the convenience store. What are you going to do? Chiang-wei has an authentication job. She is visiting someone's home. I don't know who they are. I'd better go and look around. Wang Chiang-ta, are you blindly in love? Chiang-wei is not a little girl. Why do you worry so much? She's doing her job. I am worried. I understand how Brother Chiang-ta feels. Fei, what do you know? Act smart. Can you tell me? In the world of love, all you care for is your partner. Brother Chiang-ta, I heard from big brother. Miss Chiang-wei and you fell in love. I... I sincerely wish you happiness. Are you sick? You tainted my clothes. You are so dirty. Crying like a little girl. Big brother, thank you. No more tissue papers. This is how you treat people who lost love. -I'll buy tissue papers. -Why are you weeping? He's seriously ill. You know that? He lost his love? What a big joke. Ms. Chiang-wei... Let me tell you. I am different from him. At least... Chiang-wei admired me. He resembles you though. You! All right. You have a girlfriend now and you are always teasing me. Wonderful. But let me tell you. My situation is different from Fei's. You can't compare both of us on equal terms. Yes. I am sorry. Hsiao Tieh of different terms. I don't want to entertain you. Also, regarding Auntie's statement. I found a contradicting point. What is contradicting? I spilled the perfume. The smell is all over the room. -Where is the electric fan? -I'll get it for you. Please open the windows for me. Think about it. If an odor fills up a space, we would open the windows or turn on the electric fan. In a fire, it is full of smoke. But Auntie said that the Wang's house was burning, she brought Chiang-wei in from the back door. But the firefighters said they broke into the house. Who would enter into a fire scene and close the back door? Your point makes sense. Due to some reasons, Auntie could have given a false statement. It could be possible. All right. When I return to office, I will take the written statements and check them again. Also, we need to look for the firefighter so that we talk to him again. I got to go. See you. Have fun. Where's my milk tea? You bought snacks for what? Big brother, this is for you. We lost our love. But we still need to be nourished. I dislike banana. It is your favorite instead. Hey, Chen Yun-fei. Let me tell you. The friendship between Chiang-wei and I is different from yours, all right? All you had was your own wishful thinking. You have never been through my experience when I lost love. Chiang-wei and I have good memories together. -Do you understand? -Yes, I understand. Nothing is sadder than a broken heart. But I have not given up hope. I still hold hope. I still hold hope. I am very sad. Do you know that? Man-made stuff of mass production are worthless. The color will fade. I would suggest you not to wear it. Seems like I've been conned. The boss was dishonest. -I went there two days ago. -Hang on. -Be careful of tricksters. -Hang on. -My... -Do you smell something? -I am baking a cake! -I am baking a cake! -Oh, my! -What do we do now? -Help! -It's smoky! Ms. Lien, why are you visiting today? My dad is busy for the election. I am coming over for an inspection. Could you please show me around? -Of... -I've spoken to Mr. Hu. Of course. -Let me show you around. -Sure. -Water it! -Mrs. Wang! -What to do now? -Call your husband! Husband! We're doomed! Can anyone help out? Help! Chiang-ta. Chiang-ta! Why is he so handsome? Chiang-wei, are you all right? Are you injured? I am all right. They were baking cake and the oven was burning. I was kind of frightened just now. But I thought of you all the while. So that I became less fearful. Thankfully, you rushed in on time to rescue us. Why do you think of me? During an emergency, don't think about me. During an emergency, you must protect yourself and flee the scene, all right? Wang Chiang-wei, am I clear? I worried a lot. You know that? If you suffer from a burn, -you have to shower with ginger... -Ms. Wang. Your friend is handsome. He is not my friend. He is my boyfriend. He rushed in and put out the fire. He was really handsome. -In fact... -What are you doing? I am his guardian. You must get my permission. -I want to... -No way. -I want to... -Not permitted. Hey, we didn't say anything. Nothing about him is permitted. Oh dear. Young boyfriend. -Let's go. -All right. If electronics catch fire, -don't water it. -All right. That's it. Let's go on a date. Ms. Lien, you asked for records of material purchase and sales. It is all ready. That's about it. Thank you. Ms. Lien. We may talk again, if you need more information. Is this okay? This style? HITTING WATER BALLOONS Chiang-wei. The center of gravity lies in the darts' tip. Many thought we should hold it in a 90-degree angle before throwing it out, but that's not right. You need to create a parabolic curve. Give it some strength to push it up and you will hit it. -Let me show you. -Sure. Hang on. It is unbalanced sometimes. The center of gravity might shift. -Slowly... -All right. Let me try it. -Boss, one more set. -All right. Forget it. We'll play other games. -Hey... -Let's go. Come on. -Over there! -Scoop it up! They swam away. After 1869, Qing Dynasty built three buildings of dormitory for customs officials. This is the last building. The official residence of the tax secretary. Danshui residents nicknamed it "Little White House." Its winding corridor and arches are the main features of the building. -Do you understand? -Yes. Let's go. What do you mean? What now? Our trick has been exposed now. Do you want to get rid of me? What are you talking about? I am coming up with solutions, okay? But let me remind you. Insiders might cause you trouble. Watch out if your daughter is up to something. Si-te, let's go. If you disturb my daughter, you will be doomed. It depends on what you have. It looks good for you. You conspire with outsiders to teach me a lesson. This female clothing has a blood stain. It is Teacher Si-te's. You haven't told Wang Chiang-wei? That you are the son of a murderer? Why is Chiang-ta in great fear? My biggest fear is losing you. I will protect Chiang-wei. Subtitle translation by BK Yeow
