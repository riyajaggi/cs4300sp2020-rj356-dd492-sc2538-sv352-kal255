 This guy is living so well. I want revenge. It's just fair. Why did the Wang family matters resurfaced out of the blue? How much is this? -Hello, please meet my dad. -Lien Chong-yen. Even if Si-te's dad was the seller, he's not necessarily related to that case. -The painting is gone. -Kuan Ching-ching, you can't escape. Come after me then. Let go of Chiang-wei.

 I'll let you go right now. You really care about her. Are you two in love? You have three minutes to leave. I can't forget you. That's unfair. You must not forget me as well. You look cute when you're angry. Whenever Wang Chiang-ta sees you, he looks different. I think he has a crush on you. I'm jealous of you. It's time now. See you next time, bye. -Kuan Ching-ching! -Hold on.

 Why did you steal Pu Hsin-yu's painting? There are more valuable items than it. I have my reasons. If you want to find out, come and look for me. Hey... You just let her go? We have to be trustworthy. You two don't know each other, right? Why were you flirting? How is it possible? I just ran into her. Talking about trust with a female thief? I smell a rat. I'll go after her. Ten, nine, eight, seven. Thank you for today. That thief is not a decent person. Stealing the painting in front of everybody. What a nuisance. The painting is gone, but the clues are still there. You mean that female thief? She's one of the clues. Come to think of it. She stole nothing else but this painting. How unlikely is this? Stop pretending. I've heard of it. She wanted the painting and you. She kissed you. Right? You look like you enjoyed it. -Tieh Pu-fan. -Yes? You're always fooling around. That's why you can't solve any case. If I didn't know you, I might mistake you two as a thief couple. -How is it possible? -Why not? All right, cut it out. Mr. Chin said that given the situation today, the painting will be hidden for a while. They won't dispose it immediately. Why did Lien Chong-yen have this painting? A painting has been stolen from the auction. A young pretty girl is suspected of doing the crime. The police are now investigating her real identity. These two people are not seeing each other for the first time. They're trying to fool around. You came home at this hour and you're still following that news? Why do you think about it all the time? Stop messing around. Didn't the landlord ask us to clean up the house every week? Did I block the news about the girl that you kissed? What's going on here? The vacuum cleaner is so noisy. Hi, Chiang-wei. Is electricity cheaper now? I'm paying the bills. Chiang-ta, how about we buy dinner together? Chiang-wei, what do you want? We'll buy it for you. -I want to have... -I'll stay home. Two salted fish fried rice and pork rib soup. Spicy and without onions. Thank you. Dates before mates, right? All right. I'll go alone. Wang Chiang-ta and that female thief. They must have known each other. I'll come with you. -Me too. -Forget it. You want two salted fish fried rice and pork rib soup. Spicy and without onions. Right? I've memorized it. You may stay put and follow the news. Hsiao Tieh and I will take care of it. Chiang-wei, let's go. Salted fish fried rice and pork rib soup. You'll have a stomachache. This looks good as well. Enough. You've ordered a lot. -Hsiao Tieh. -Yes? Let me ask you. You knew Chiang-ta for years. You two are close friends. You know a lot about his love life, right? For example, how many girlfriends he has had? Or does he like a girl recently? Things like that. Wang Chiang-ta's love life seems to intrigue you. Well, not really. Just recently, Kuan Ching-ching kissed him. It's just that waiting here is a bit boring. So I'm just asking. Kuan Ching-ching is frivolous. Wang Chiang-ta always feels bored. As you know, I rarely talk about Chiang-ta's love life. However, as far as I'm concerned, he's never had a girlfriend. Really? He's in his thirties and he's never had a girlfriend? Strictly speaking, Chiang-ta is an introvert. He loves new knowledge and his favorite is mathematics. You know he loves calculating probability and the like. Having said that, some girls liked him and took the initiative to get closer with him. But Chiang-ta gave no responses. He did not give any feedback and the girls waned off. There's one person... who he likes a lot. Who is it? The Dark Queen. -Not again? -Yeah. You mentioned her several times. Who is she? Well... Hello, is our dinner ready? What's taking so long? Hey, who is she? She is... Stop asking if you still want to see me around. Please. Share some information, would you? A glimpse into it... Well... Chiang-ta doesn't know who the Dark Queen is. She's going around without traces. Her mysterious image intrigued Chiang-ta all the time. No way. No way. All right. No way we can skip the boiled beef. It is so delicious, right? May I order boiled beef? For takeout, please. Chiang-wei, are you okay? Kuan Ching-ching always wears dark clothes and her whereabouts are untraceable. Could she be the Dark Queen? Let me try it. It's very spicy. Are you two playing "shut up" tonight? You don't talk at all. Chiang-ta. Old Yen asked us to submit new notes this week. Have you written it? The honest and straightforward Wang Chiang-wei, and the loner Wang Chiang-ta, who is sharp and sensitive, are not compatible. All right then. You ignored me. Wang Chiang-ta. Wang Chiang-ta. Wang Chiang-ta! Someone's calling him at this time of the night. But I'm his only friend. Hello? Hello? I miss you so much. Do you miss me? Who's on the line? You kissed and forgot about me. I'm so disappointed. I still miss your kiss. It's you. Do you recognize me now? My phone could be bugged, don't you know? Because you're my accomplice? What a bad joke. Do you feel shy? You're so cute. Can we meet up tomorrow? I have what you need. I'll inform you about the time and location. Wait for my message. Who is it? Tell me. Are you trying to eavesdrop? Hey. Chiang-ta. Let me ask you about the note arrangement. I'm not sure how it works. -Are you free now? -I'm done. Did I get on his nerves recently? Let me tell you. You didn't get on his nerves. But the call... was important for him. He even left the table. That was so unlike him. It was an important call. Old Yen, pick an animal randomly. An owl. -An owl. -Boredom. You're coming alone? I thought Chiang-wei is always with you? What's going on today... Coming. Hi. Good morning. -Good morning. -Well... It seems like the young couple had an argument. Who's the young couple? Mind your words. The girl on Chiang-ta's laptop screen, is that his new girlfriend? Oh, gosh. Wang Chiang-ta. -You're getting more popular. -Is that your type? That is... Kuan Ching-ching? Wang Chiang-ta, you're... I didn't set it. Who else could have set it? It's your laptop. Is that your preferred type of girl? She sabotaged my laptop. And she set a new passcode. That girl is quite special. -That's right. -It doesn't look like a 3D photo. Let's meet up tomorrow. I have what you need. I'll inform you about the time and location. Wait for my message. Tutor class as the center point, with a 100-meter radius. And an angle of 165.5-degree. That's the shop. Therefore, she is asking me to meet up there at twelve o'clock. Boss, we're in trouble. Even Teacher Si-te is being blackmailed. Teacher Si-te? ENTICED MALE STUDENTS What nonsense is this? How strange. Where did you get it? Someone faxed it. Who would want to humiliate me? Could it be World Tutorial Class? -This is... -Li Ta-shih tries to get you... Old Yen, may I file a police report? He has crossed the line. -Sue him. -We must file a police report. He has really crossed the line. He wrote such nonsense. Don't worry. Nobody would believe such allegation. -Hello, Chang-tai Tutorial Class. -It doesn't seem so. -That's right. -No such thing. -Yeah. -That's too obvious. No such thing. Don't worry. All right. Thank you. Bye. The news was leaked. Chiang-ta and Chiang-wei, what's wrong with them? All of sudden, Chiang-ta asked me how I see Chiang-wei. -Tieh Pu-fan. -What? Are you sure you want to court Chiang-wei? I'm serious with Chiang-wei. I'm getting very serious. But he gives Chiang-wei the cold-shoulders. How fishy. -Big brother. -Where are you hanging out? With friends. Do I need to report to you? With brother Chiang-ta and Ms. Chiang-wei? Bingo. I don't have many friends. Big brother, frankly speaking, you're lazy. Those things that concern you are within your reach in five-minute walks. And they are of importance for you. So I thought about it. They must be brother Chiang-ta and Ms. Chiang-wei. You're hanging out with Chiang-ta too much. You're even mimicking him. Even your hairstyle is identical. -Let me tell you this. -Okay. You should learn this hand gesture. Yes. This side. -This side? -Yes. Remember not to smile when you talk. -You shouldn't smile. -Yup. Act cool. -Be cool. -Yeah. Let me check. -Like this. -Be sentimental. -Into the emotion. -Act cool, all right? -Act cool and smart. -As if you're really cool. -All right. -Cool. It's Li Ta-shih. He controls the behind the scenes. You knew it now. Investigate him then. I filed police reports repeatedly. They said they've recorded it. Useless people. Li Ta-shih, I'll fight you tooth and nail. I warn you now. I... Who wanted to defame me? I didn't offend anybody. The culprit will be exposed. How is Si-te? Did her male colleagues bullied her? No? It was... That's really too much. Si-te. Things will be all right. Sorry, I look ugly right now. Don't talk like an outsider. Well... Let me tell you. I'll help investigate this case. Don't worry. -Really? -I mean it. Rest assured. Thank you. Don't mention it. Bullying a girl? That's too much. Chiang-ta. This noon, you and I will have lunch with Chiang-wei. I'll go next time. I'm busy today. I need to go now. Hey, Wang Chiang-ta. Wang... Wang Chiang-ta. Hey. Chiang-ta. Why is he so stealthy? Chiang-wei. This noon, I'll have lunch with you. I have some work later. You should accompany Teacher Si-te. Bring her for lunch. Well, Chiang-wei... I think you should... Oh, please. -Please. -Chiang... You may leave if you have work. I'm all right. I'm free now. So we'll go for lunch. I'm starving now. All right. Don't cry. Teacher. Can you teach me? What tricks are you playing now? I want to see you. Is she Dark Queen? You haven't answered my question. You asked why I stole Pu Hsin-yu's painting. It was more valuable, right? I stole a painting earlier. It was same as yesterday's one. I want to bring together two paintings. Where did you steal them? Be my boyfriend and I'll tell you. What? Wang Chiang-ta! You hesitated. You didn't say no. It means I'm not bad, right? You know what? I made a lot of effort to look for you. You should know my intention. Hey, you, lady... Why are you forcing him? A relationship can never be forced. You'll reap bitter fruit if you forcefully harvest it. Don't you know that? You're not Chiang-ta. How can you tell if he likes me or not? You're not Chiang-ta either. How can you say that he likes you? What's your relationship with Chiang-ta? Are you interrogating me? We're friends and colleagues. So what? I've kissed him. I'm in a higher position compared to your ordinary friend status. -You're... -Hang on. Cut the nonsense. -Shut up! -Shut up! You're discussing about me but I can't talk? Kissing is no big deal. You can't have him. Hey, kissing is like a signature. I'm the one who signed. What now? I've kissed him. And we're friends. So my position is higher now. You should leave him alone. Let's go. Things are getting more interesting. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. All right, no problem. Hsiao Tieh. Thanks for your company. I feel much better now. You don't need to thank me. We're friends now, right? I trust your personality. We haven't known each other for long. But you're a straightforward person. In front of your friends and colleagues, you say things as they are. You're not calculative. I saw how you teach. You're strict to your students. You set high targets for yourself. I admire your professionalism. As for the culprit, don't worry. I will investigate the case. Have a good meal. Such things shouldn't ruin your good mood. All right. Thank you. Oh, my. He knows me well. Is he my knight? Hey. You won't get involved with Kuan Ching-ching, right? Why didn't you just reject her? I'm investigating a case and she's holding some details. Also, I have my own plan. You interfered and kissed me out of the blue. Well... This is for your own good. I wondered if you would date a female thief. You're thinking too much. I still thank you though. This is the first time you thanked me. I'll retract my words if you're not used to it. No way. I want it. You are... an important friend of mine. I like you as a friend. Please don't ignore me anymore. Otherwise, I'll feel hurt. Did I lose my head just now? When Kuan Ching-ching kissed me, I had no feelings. But when Chiang-wei kissed me. I felt my heartbeat. But why? Same as the time at Lightless Restaurant. Prosecutor Tieh. You've checked it. What's the situation now? This fax number is the same number sent to other parents. I'll get the IP location of the fax number. And I'll locate the culprit. Good job. Prosecutor Tieh, please help us more. No problem. Piece of cake. Thank you. Boss, someone is looking for you. I made him wait for you in the office. Looking for me? Who is it? -Excuse me. -All right. Thank you. You are... Yen-pa. You get rich and forget about your prisoner friend. Chan Ting-hsuan. You're leading a good life. Art piece. Antique. And my life? You shot me and that's it. I need to seek justice from you today. I didn't pull the trigger back then. You were imprisoned for murder. But you chose to blame me instead. What's wrong with you? Big brother, you and I were the only armed members. Other than you, who would have fired a shot? I said it wasn't me. Why are you accusing me of something I didn't do? To show your upper hand? Watch out. You'll have a price to pay. We said that these questions always appear on tests. Class, please take note. And now, refer to page 36 to 42. There are six questions of a similar type. Take them as your homework. We'll discuss next lesson. Egypt emphasized slavery. It had a distinct class system. It is still the same now. Secondly, slavery appeared in the riverbank region. -Big brother. -Yeah? I found out who sent the blackmail. IP address of the blackmail comes from an internet cafe near Chang-tai Tutorial Class. According to the time it was sent and the location, I've made a comparison. I found him to be an assistant of World Tutorial Class. He's named Chou Wen-hsin. World Tutorial Class has been suspicious. Fei, good job. With this evidence, arrest the suspect. That's obviously you. And you're denying it. I can't be polite with you! Li Ta-shih, are you holding a grudge against me? Do you want to set me up again? Why did you blackmail Teacher Lien? Ladies' reputation is important. Don't you know that? Don't you have a conscience? -You've crossed the line. -All right. You'll suffer a stroke. Calm down. Wen-hsin went to the internet cafe. Those photos made no evidence. -Spare me your nonsense. -Let me tell you. Among Wen-hsin's tasks, it is his job to disseminate brochures at internet cafes. -It's normal if he appears in photos. -He is your subordinate. So I'm considered guilty? I'm innocent. You've crossed the line! What now? Sir, he's so arrogant. You've crossed the line. Do you want to hit me? Prosecutor, I will sue him. Look at his behavior. Go ahead and sue me. -All right. -Do you have standards? Stop this nonsense. Have some tea. We have good tea at our bureau. Vent your anger. Li Ta-shih, the evidence points to your disadvantage. First, the fact that you sent the blackmail is more than clear. Second, the pretty Ms. Lien could sue you for defamation. Third, she could also sue you for common assault. Do you need to be so stubborn? Please cooperate with us, all right? Oh, dear. Someone made me do this, you know? I didn't want to do it. If the case is brought to court, our tutor classes could shut down. All right? Let's talk man to man. -Let's coordinate. -But hey... -I'm not going to coordinate with you. -Hold on... Someone incited you. Who is it? I want to find out. Well... I can't really disclose that. Who are you referring to? Who is it? Tell me. Nothing. Nobody incited me. I was the culprit. You may sue me. -Who's trying to defame? -Sue him. Hello, Chang-tai Tutorial Class. This person was here several days ago. So he is a supplier. Thank you for your help. May I bring you out for a meal? Chiang-wei asked me to help you. I'm doing a favor. -You don't need to thank me. -Well... Chiang-wei asked you to help out, that's why you complied? Well... Chiang-wei's request is part of it. These tasks are also part of my job as a prosecutor. -That's right. -Please don't think so. I asked you out as a friend. If you say no, that's embarrassing for me. Let's have a meal together. Sure. Mr. Chin. Hi, good evening. Good evening. I'll have a special meal for takeout please. Are you in a hurry? Chiang-ta is coming over. Aren't you going to eat with him? Is Chiang-ta coming over soon? Yeah. Whenever Dorothy is hosting program, he'll be here. Dorothy. Do you mean Dorothy of Starry Night Program? That's right. That lady host. Chiang-ta admires her a lot. When Dorothy's program runs on Wednesdays and Fridays, the time comes and he'll be here to listen to it. Chiang-ta admires Dorothy. Come on, Dorothy has poor jokes. But Chiang-ta admires her. Mr. Chin, you think Dorothy have poor jokes? That's right. Speaking of those hosts, what makes them funny? They're different from ordinary people. Why are you so happy? Oh, well. I'm not. Thank you, Mr. Chin. I'll put the money here. I have to go. Bye. Your change. Young kids. Hey, you know what? Sherlock admires Dorothy. Do you mean your mean guy, Sherlock? He's not mean. He's Sherlock Holmes. Oh, what shall I do now? What's the matter now? He admires Dorothy, not Wang Chiang-wei. What is it to be happy about? The point is, he likes my jokes. Someone likes your jokes? That's hard to believe. Your brother Chiang-ta looks weird today. Did something happen at the tutor class? I have no idea. Good evening, everybody. We have a story today. There is a letter from Ta-wei, a mechanical engineering student of Taoyuan University. He wrote to Pei-ju of Chinese Literature Department. Let's invite Dorothy to read the love letter. "I don't know when it started. I'm interested in the topics you mentioned. The scenery that you described, I found it to be beautiful. Your expression, your smile, I wish to collect them all. Before this, I thought life was dull. But ever since I met you, I wish to share every detail of life with you. My mechanical engineering background is as if a Gamma ray is trapped in the universe of Chinese literature. I'm like a male bird trying to approach his favorite female..." Dorothy, from zero to one. Wang Chiang-wei. "Because of you, I know this is how it feels when I like someone. Because I like you, I started to imagine that you are the only character in my perfect story." Mr. Chin, please cancel my beef noodles. I need to go now. Are you on a diet? Chiang-ta used to eat more, but he's eating less today. Wang Chiang-ta. Why do you go down one stop earlier? I ate too much for dinner. So I decided to walk home. How about you? I ate too much for dinner too. I decided to do exercise. So I'm cycling around. What a coincidence. Tell me then, the probability of us running into each other? 100 percent. Since it's a coincidence that we met here, how about this? Let me take you home. I'm exercising. I want my bicycle to be heavier. Since you said that, why not? Let's go home. I'm using this trick to treat her coffee. Would she feel bored? But this is the season to fall in love. Right? I told you not to... I have something to say today. I'll travel around the world. Travel around the world? All of a sudden? What are you doing? I think I'm too smart. My tricks are always accurate. Right? But hey, why isn't the bus coming? The last bus service ended. Why is Chiang-wei so late today? I should give her a call. Go faster. Wang Chiang-ta, go faster. Wang Chiang-ta. What? I drank two cups of coffee and I feel hyper now. Let's talk. Caffeine is nothing for you, right? Two cups exceed my limit. Let me ask you. Have you been visiting Lightless Restaurant lately? I'm moving out already. I'm not visiting. How about your Dark Queen? What about her? If you don't see her, or you meet her again in future, what do you plan to do? -Is this a multiple-choice question? -Wang Chiang-ta, let me ask you. What about your love life in the future? My future love life is a matter of probability. That's right. Love relationship might fall from the sky at any given time. It's highly suspicious that you like someone now. Right? It's not a big deal if I like someone or not. I would still need to solve my dad's problems. All right. Also, don't forget. In the world of love, you're a kindergarten student. You should think about the questions that I asked you. Good morning. Good morning, Teacher Si-te. Good morning. Ms. Maggie, why are you... Teacher Si-te, you look really good today. I'm so happy that I want to give you a vase of flowers. This is for you. You're exaggerating. You're exaggerating. Do you have a date today? That's right. I have dinner tonight. Chiang-wei asked me to help you. I'm doing a favor. Did he help me out because of Chiang-wei? Chiang-wei. Yes? Let me ask you something. Do you know Hsiao Tieh's preferred type of girls? Such as, vigorous girls or beautiful girls or cute girls such as your type. -Such as my type? -Yes. How is that possible? I think he has a wide range of preference. He seems to be fine with any type of girl. -Really? -Yes. A wide range of preference. Fine with any types of girl. Does Hsiao Tieh care for friends? Hello? Yen-pa, it is me. You... Why are you calling me? I want to inform you. I've placed a bomb in your tutor class. Before 2:30 p.m. today, if you fail to transfer ten million dollars to my bank account. I'll detonate it. So that you'll lose everything. You think I'm intimidated by your nonsense? You're as irritating as you were 20 years ago. Walk to your window. Look at the pedestrian walk downstairs. Let's check out what you'll see. What is it? What can you see? What can I see? Pedestrians and vehicles. Can you see a trash can? Yes. What about it? Take a closer look. What was that? Let me check it out. What are you doing? You... Hey, what are you doing? You're playing with explosives. Do you trust me now? I have a stronger explosive in your tutor class. If it's detonated, you'll say goodbye to your building. My... My tutor class... You're... You know I'm an impatient person. Remember, if I don't get the money before 2:30 p.m., you will lose your tutor class for the rest of your life. It's 11:30 a.m. now. You have three hours to go. What are you doing? You... Chiang-ta! Help me! Is there an explosive here? That red dot. That red dot is the explosive. That's it. He doesn't seem to be kidding. -My goodness. -What is he doing? Is he out of his mind? Old Yen, did you offend others? Why is he targeting you? Chan Ting-hsuan is crazy. He is released on parole recently. He thinks I'm rich. So he came to intimidate me. Old Yen. Did you say that this is Chan Ting-hsuan. Yes. Why? Do you know him? It's been more than two decades and he has a different look. But why is Chan looking for Old Yen? Why are you staring at me? I've informed Hsiao Tieh. He's coming now. What to do now? What shall we do now? First, let's evacuate all the students. Before the evacuation is done, don't say anything about the explosive. -All right. We'll keep quiet. -Police are coming over. Once the police is here, let's let them handle the case. All right. All right. For now, we'll inform our students that there is a blackout in the afternoon. So we'll suspend our classes. Teacher Jen-i, your students have a class now. Please inform them that we'll suspend all classes. We need to repair the power transmission today. If there is nothing important, let's call it a day. Go home now. Hurry up. Take your stuff. We'll talk next time. Go home now. We'll resume class soon. Teacher Si-te, some of your students are coming over. -Inform them via phone calls. -Class, there will be a blackout later. We'll suspend the class in the afternoon. You may keep your stuff now. Be quick. All right... First ten students to leave will have my autographed photos. -Be quick. -I want autographed photos. Be quick. We'll now... Teacher Wang. There are students in the public area and the study room. Please inform them about the class suspension. Our tutor class will have a blackout in the afternoon. We'll suspend all classes. All right, dismiss. -Thank you, teacher. -Thank you, teacher. Leave via the emergency exit. Do not take the elevator. -All right. Goodbye, teacher. -Bye. Class, walk faster. Students on the front should walk faster. You can use the stairwell too. All right? -Let me go. -Class. Don't use the elevator. I won't give you the photos. You must use the emergency exit. -That's right. Exit from there. -Let's go. Take the emergency exit. Hurry. But we have to leave from there. Over here, be quick. Teacher Si-te, have they been evacuated? -All the students have left. -Okay. Okay. Let's go. -Class suspension. -Do you want to go somewhere? -Are they gone? -Yes. Everybody is gone. -They are gone. -Okay. Let's go. -All right. -Let's go. Let's go. I haven't checked the female restroom. Anyone there? Anyone there? Blackout. My cell phone. Anyone there? My cell phone. My cell phone. The battery's empty. An empty battery at this ungodly hour. Chiang-wei. Chiang-wei! Wang Chiang-wei. Calm down. It will be all right. Emergency exit. Found it. The bomb squad is ready now. The Thunder Squad has combed all levels. Make sure everybody is safe. I'm thinking that Chan Ting-hsuan gave him an account number. That could be a temporary account number. Once your money is deposited, he will transfer it out immediately. So that we can never investigate. We must not take it easy. Hsiao Tieh. Can you trace that hidden number? We have to wait for Chan to call in again, before we can trace his signal. Are you going to transfer the money? What transfer? Why would I give in to him? All right. He will make the call again. He wants you to follow his instruction. If Chan calls you again, make the conversation last longer so that we can trace his signal -and locate him. -All right. I will. Control your emotion. Incoming call. Trace the source of the call, turn on your speaker. Yen-pa, you have a lot of people on your side. You're bringing all the teachers to have a party together. Right? I'll burst your tutor class off. Would you have a peaceful life then? You crazy guy! Let me tell you. I... Okay. You may talk now. Think about it clearly. You don't have time now. It's nearly 2:30 p.m. already. You better transfer the money at the bank next door. How can I get that much money... He's hung up. He already hung up. The call was too short. We can't trace it. It's easier than what we imagined. What do you mean? Chan said he will monitor Old Yen. He said that the teachers are also partying. Which means he can see us. He's standing at a vantage point to monitor everything. Let me check. This is the tutor class. To monitor the entrance of the tutor class, you must observe from northeast angle. The vantage point should be around these two buildings. If you want to monitor the tutor class and the bank for money transfer, this would be the building. Hsiao Tieh. This is the location. Fei. Tell your police colleagues to check this building. -Be careful. -Yes, sir. It is now one hour to 2:30 p.m. Watch out your timing. We'll get our job done as soon as possible. I'll borrow money. Keep your line active. He'll call you again. Ready. Get ready. Prosecutor Tieh. We've arrived at the building. That's right. We're civilian police officers. He'll never find out. All right. Keep your head down and be quick. Don't let him see you. No action from you? Transfer the money and don't play tricks. Am I running a bank business? Taking ten million bank notes as I like? -I'm still borrowing money. -Is that my problem? You better be quick. If I let your tutor class explode, you'll lose everything. I can't tell if you are sincere to transfer the money. If you keep the money, I'll detonate it earlier. Enjoy the firecracker show. Hey, you crazy guy. See that? He said something and hung up. What to do now? What shall we do now? You may comply and pretend that you're transferring the money. Before the explosive is found, try to fight for more time. Prosecutor Tieh, please find the explosive. I can't lose my tutor class. This is my life savings. We are trying very hard. You... You have to cooperate with us, all right? I'll cooperate. Kun, cover Mr. Yen to the bank. Going to the bank? You want me to transfer the money? Not really. Listen up. Do this for the time being, all right? We'll coordinate with Chan so that we can buy time to arrest him. He might take the money and transfer it around. If the police can't find him, I would lose my money. These are part of movie plots. Ten million dollars. Give it to him. No. No way! You have to buy time so that the police can arrest him. Don't you know that? Even the police are not confident, right? I won't trust you. There must be an alternative. Chiang-ta, please find another solution. The probability of your tutor class being bombed, and your possible loss of ten million, time will be the denominator. As time is running out, chances of both scenarios are higher. I knew it. -So you will... -Prosecutor Tieh. I'll transfer the money. Bomb Squad hasn't identified the explosive. Where could it be? When Chan brought water supplies, he walked past the lobby and the walkway. He arrived at the public area. He stopped at Old Yen's office and the storage room. He hid before reappearing. The explosive should be the size of a lunch box. Bomb Squad has combed through the public area, walkway, and the lobby. Bomb Squad, attention please. Check Old Yen's office and the storage room. Be quick. Chan Ting-hsuan is not in the building. He could be using a remote control to detonate the explosive. Therefore, he tied the setting on the explosive. It's mercury bomb. He's playing against mercury's stability. Tie it to his cell phone and set an alarm. When the time is up or a cell phone call is connected, the explosive will be detonated. Bomb Squad, attention please. Early investigation points to explosive controlled remotely. Oh, no. Chiang-wei is missing. -I didn't see her either. -I tried calling her but there's nothing. What? Is she still inside? Did the Bomb Squad find anybody? No. They said the place has a blackout. It's dark and nobody is there. Did she return to find something and got stuck in there? No way. She's ill. Chiang-ta, hold on. -Don't come near. -You said Chiang-wei is ill? Get Fei to arrest Chan Ting-hsuan. He must not detonate the bomb. Chiang-ta! I can't wait anymore. Fei, listen up. Arrest Chan Ting-hsuan. The bomb is controlled remotely. The only emergency exit of the tutor class. The only way to get in or out. Did Chiang-wei go the wrong way and entered the storage room? Chiang-wei! I wrote an extra stroke. No way. I can't write it. How much time do I have now? Less than 20 minutes. What do I do? What shall I do now? Sir, has Chan been arrested? Not yet. Not yet. What now? Do I have to transfer all the money? I don't want that. That's annoying. I don't want that. All right. I'll take it in my stride. Ms. Hsiao? Please give me another bank transfer note. Don't worry. Attention please. We found a bomb under Old Yen's office desk. Can you dispose it? The bomb is tied to a cell phone. It's a homemade bomb created with mercury theory. Oh, no. Not the 15th floor. Keep searching. Sir, have they arrested Chan? Not yet. Please don't... Chiang-wei. Chiang-wei! Chiang-wei! Chiang-wei! Chiang-wei. -Are you okay? -Chiang-ta. I couldn't find the emergency exit. I'm trapped here. It's all right now. I'll get you out. -Let's go. -I want to get out. Sure. Come on. It's all right. Freeze! Police! Squat down. Chiang-wei. Don't move. It seems like I have to detonate the bomb. Don't move! Freeze! Freeze! Prosecutor Tieh, we've arrested him. He's under arrest. Hang on. Ms. Hsiao, please stop! Ms. Hsiao, please stop! Don't move! All right. Got it. Thank you. Is Chiang-wei all right? I'll follow her. Hsiao Tieh. I'll take care of her. You have to handle the case. -Be careful. -Sure. Please take care of Chiang-wei. Chiang-ta. You really like Chiang-wei. Hsiao Tieh, thank you. My pleasure. This is my job. Are you okay? I'm fine. How about you? I'm all right. Hsiao Tieh. Do you like Chiang-wei? Chan Ting-hsuan. You behaved well during jail term. You've been released on parole. You have a stable job now. Why can't you maintain your good behavior? Why did you get involved in crime again? Sir, how many years have I spent behind bars? Are you asking me? You served a 23-year jail term. You're still not afraid? 23 years, two months, and five days. If I have a child, he or she has graduated from college already. Yen Chang-tai wasted 23 years of my life. I'll seek revenge from him and not anybody else. Yen Chang-tai? What do you mean? Check my old statement in the earlier years. There were five suspects. One of them was Yen-pa. That's Yen Chang-tai. We set the place ablaze and were about to leave. We arrived at the warehouse and Yen Chang-tai fired a shot. He started a gang infighting, and my leg was shot. The police arrested me. From zero to one, I've met you. All I wished for was the 20 percent probability. What is the probability to fall in love with someone? Chiang-wei. This facial expression doesn't suit you. Hello? Chiang-ta. What's up? I must tell you this. It's their break time now. Talk to Chan Ting-hsuan in the room. You have to be quick. Thank you for covering me all the time. No problem. Be quick. Chan Ting-hsuan. Let's carry on with our topic. Can you elaborate again? How Old Yen got you imprisoned. 23 years ago, Yen Chang-tai and I robbed the Wang Family. He started a gang infighting and shot my leg. Which was why I was arrested and imprisoned. Hold on. 23 years ago, you robbed the Wang Family together with Ten Chang-tai. Old Yen was one of the robbers in the case. Can you say things clearly? Sir, is it necessary for me to explain the case to this tutor class teacher? He's qualified to hear from you. Chan, please cooperate with the police investigation. I gave a truthful statement back then. I only knew my big brother. That was the first time I met with Yen-pa. He claimed to be a great thief. But he did things in a dilly-dally manner. He's always calculating and I was angry. Had it not been our cooperation in the robbery case, I would have shot and killed him. Chiang-wei and Chiang-ta, outsiders might see them as a couple. They can't be a couple. We can be a couple. In the world of love, you should care no more. How can you let go of such a key suspect? This is a godsend chance for me to seek revenge. Teacher Chiang-wei. You came just in time. -It's been exposed. I must do something. -What are you doing? Subtitle translation by BK Yeow
