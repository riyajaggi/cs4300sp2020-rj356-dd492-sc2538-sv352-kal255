 You cannot live here anymore. You can live in my house. What are you two doing? At the sofa. Actually, he has his own charm. Aunt, why are you here? The three of you stay under the same roof? I rang the doorbell at your place. But nobody answered the door. Then I asked Sophie.

 She told me that you were staying in a different place for the time being. She gave me your address. Now, how come you live with two men? Ma'am, she couldn't help it, -because her flat was-- -My flat's... water pipes got broken. The place was all flooded, so I had no choice but to move here. How come I heard there was a burglar? Yes, also because of that. Hey, don't mention about any unlucky incident. I don't want my aunt to worry. I understand. However, isn't it be a bit inconvenient

 to be living here like this? Ma'am, don't mention it. Let me introduce myself. My name is Tieh Pu-fan. I am a prosecutor. My duty is to protect citizens. This is Wang Chiang-ta, my good friend. He's a university professor. They happen to work together at the tutorial school. So, we are all good friends. No need to worry. She can stay here without hassle. I raised Chiang-wei since she was a child. I treat her as my own daughter. So, I'm just concerned. Nothing else. I hope you don't mind. -No. -No, we don't. Just that seeing you here today, I couldn't believe my eyes. Ma'am, you have such a charisma. -Tieh. -What? Her auntie must be tired. Let her take a rest. Of course. Let me take her to her room. -We'll talk tomorrow. -Okay. Let's go. Right. There's something I have to tell you. What is it? I saw someone put Dad's painting in the office. Coincidentally, that person also collects Dad's paperweights. Maybe he bought them. Your dad's paintings were on the market for a long time. It's not surprising that it would be in different hands. Right! Should I ask Mr. Chin about it? He's familiar with the painting market. Maybe he knows more about it. Chiang-wei, I understand that you'd like to find your dad's stuff. But then what? Also, what if remembering everything makes you sick again? Don't worry. I have already recovered. Aunt was worried about me getting into trouble. But if I just seek an opinion from Mr. Chin, it should be fine. He owns a pawnshop. He must have heard something. What about those antiques? Mostly sold. Only one broken jade stone was not accepted in the black market. Master Qin, nice to meet you. I am introduced to you by Prosecutor Tieh Pu-fan. Sorry to bother you. Prosecutor Tieh Pu-fan is my good friend. So please feel free. Could I trouble you with this? This jade is real. But it is only one part. It is unknown what the whole thing should be. This should be-- Boss, someone is looking for you. Please wait for a moment. Chiang-wei, why are you here? Mr. Chin. I have a favor to ask you. Do you remember Dad had a pair of lion paperweights? -A few days ago-- -Sorry, you need to wait. I have a guest inside. Oh, really? Him? Lower part is a lotus. Normally, a Guanyin sits on it. But now, we only have half of it. So, it's very difficult to assess what it originally looked like and its value. I'm not interested in the appraisal for the price. I just want to know whether the other half is available on the market. I can ask around about this. Thank you. My pleasure. Chiang-wei, you mentioned your dad's paperweights. What about them? Mr. Chin, you were close to my dad. Do you recall if he ever sold those paperweights? He really liked them a lot. There were many bids but he would not sell them. I see. It seems like they were stolen during the burglary that year. But now one of them is available, -and it seems the other one will appear. -Yes. Could you keep an eye? No problem. If your aunt knows about this, she will be mad. Then we keep this as secret. Something lost? Yes. We got robbed when I was a child. We lost a lot of things. But it was a long time ago, so the items must have gone through several owners. Those paperweights were used by my dad, so they mean a lot to me. He passed away? Yes. Both my parents passed away. You are alone? I don't feel lonely. I have Aunt, and you... And other colleagues. Also my students. That doesn't mean you don't feel lonely. Why did you learn antique appraisal? Is it because you love history? Actually, it's because of my dad. I had a lot of exposures to antique paintings when I was younger. So you're following his footsteps. He must feel very happy hearing this. I think so, too. We're going to be late for the tutorial class. Give me a lift. No. Did I promise to give you a lift? We're almost late. Why not? We're going the same way. It doesn't mean I have to. So mean. Listen. It's not going to be a comfortable ride. All right. I'm on it. -Let's go. -Go. Good morning, Teacher Si-te and Teacher Jen-i. -Hi, Teacher Guo. -Morning, Chiang-wei. It's fourth time. What fourth time? The fourth time they have arrived together suspiciously. That's all right. They may have just met outside. It's very easy to meet each other there. Teacher Wang. Teacher Wang. How come you two recently come together to work? Is it possible that you two... are living together? -Teacher Wang. -Hey. -Hey. -Teacher Wang. Stop this. We just met at the lobby. And then we came in together. Told you. It was just like... that? Is it true, Teacher Wang? Teacher Wang. It's true. All right. Maybe I thought too much. Everyone is here. -Boss. -Great. Let me make a report about the enrollment situation. Starting from Chiang-wei. Let me see. Higher Secondary One, for social science. 16 students. Better this time. Higher Secondary Three. 12 students. No change. A pity. It's all right. You made improvements. Perhaps they want a quick fix, but the social sciences require good foundation. Yes, quick fix is possible in math. You can write from zero to nine, then get full marks. That is not what I meant. I understood you. Teacher Wang. Solving questions requires skill as well. I don't agree. I saw you teach them a lot of techniques but they didn't understand. How can it be? Techniques. They work because they save some time in answering. More time can be spent on difficult questions. Without serious understanding, they will forget everything and will not get good marks in the final exam. If they are familiar with the techniques, they will get good marks. Just techniques without understanding, that is not teaching. It's misleading. Attending a tutorial class, but having no improvement, that's what I call misleading. You... Okay, do you dare to make a bet? Hsiao Ching's Math and History scores are similar. You teach Math, and I teach History. Let's see which subject she scores better this time. If you win, I will forget everything. If I win, repay your debt as soon as possible. I never owe you any money. So, are you scared of making a bet? Not really. I just don't want to. You dare not make a bet with me. Look at him. He dares not. Okay. Go ahead. Let's make a bet. Do you feel like they're arguing but there is something going on, something special... They are at each other's throat. Not like this. Not like this. Let me be the booker. -You can place the bets with me. -Right. -What's there to bet on? -How? Everyone would bet on Teacher Wang as the winner. Mine is different. -How different? -I bet Chiang-ta will win by five marks. Five marks. If he doesn't win by at least 5 marks, -I'll pay two dollars for one. -Two for one. If it's a draw, five dollars for one. -A draw. -Five dollars for one. If Chiang-wei wins, ten dollars for one. -Ten for one, great. -How come? -Come on, bet. -I will bet on... Cash is accepted. -I'm betting. -Hurry up. -Come on. -Bet. I also want to bet. Come on. Who do you want to place your bet on? Of course, I'm betting on myself to win. Sure. -Here's my credit card. -Oh, wow! -Wow! -Make a record. -Make a record. -Use all my money. -Come on... -Who are you betting on? Let me bet. Please don't spread it. I am sending the money now. Yes, I am. I'm already in front of the ATM, okay? Teacher Jen-i? What are you doing? Don't call me teacher. I'll get recognized. You listened to the instructions to remit? This may be a scam. Beware. This is complicated. If I don't pay, those photos... -What photos? -Go away. None of your business. None of your business. You should solve the problem by calling the police. No, if I report this, I will be in big trouble. I will be finished. Go away. Talk to Prosecutor Tieh Pu-fan. He can help you. That means calling the police. You are crazy. -Could you just-- -Talk to Teacher Wang. Teacher Wang? Do you remember that he quickly found out who stole the student list? I think he can help you. Teacher Wang? I think that would work. Could you talk to him immediately? Please. I'm counting on you. Why count on me? I count on you to contact him. I don't interact with him much. Bu if I leave this to you, I think it will be all right. I don't think so. He would not respond to me. He would. -He wouldn't. -He would. Why? Don't you know he likes you? Shut up. How could it be? You know it. He won't give up unless God forbids. He won't give up on you. He is definitely into you. I have seen many people like this. -Are you serious? -Yes. Hurry and find him for me. Off you go. Teacher Wang. Is Teacher Jen-i right? Does he really like me? -You? -Don't say a word. I need to ask you a favor. What? Teacher Jen-i is in trouble. Could you help him? -Teacher Tseng Jen-i? -Yes. What is it to me? What if... I was the one who asked you to help him? No. What do you want to help him? We are all colleagues. You should help him. Please. Please. Colleagues... Colleagues. So troublesome. It's a small thing for you, Sherlock Holmes. Please? Let's go. I am now helping you or him? What do you think? What happened? All right. Whatever I say, we stay as colleagues, all right? Of course. Her name is Ming. No. It is her nickname on the Internet. We knew each other on the Internet. I gave her cars, houses, diamonds, rubies. -Whatever she wanted. -You purchased the Internet points? Right. I gave her whatever she wanted. Then we got closer. She invited me to meet her at an Internet cafe. Sir, your drink. I arrived earlier than her. I drank the drink. All of a sudden, I fell unconscious. When I woke up, I slept for about three hours. I was about to leave when I realized that my pants were loosened to my knees. I could not remember what happened. Whether it was too hot, or my belt was too loose. It doesn't matter. Later, I received this photo. -No need. -Take it away. -It will hurt my eyes. -Don't need to see. Just show me Ming's profile picture. Okay. -Thanks. -Lovely. Chiang-wei, listen. I have always relied on myself to succeed. I work hard. Like roller coasters. -With ups and downs, -How come she looks like Hsiao Ching? fast and slow. Everything is in my control, until I received this, then I found myself derailed. Why my life is now in the hands of this nobody-- What do you think? From the way she is replying, it doesn't seem like there's only one person. I mean, this account is run by multiple people. You mean a fraud syndicate? I don't know. Most importantly, you'll not solve this problem by sending the money. it's better if it can be solved by money, because I got money. What if she does not delete the photo after getting the money? The only option is to ask her out. Good. Mr. Hsun, you moved here for a cheaper rent, to save money for Hsiao Ching to study abroad. If I were her, I would feel so blessed. Not really. I miss the old place. Why do I need to study abroad? Hsiao Ching, Mr. Hsun is doing this for your benefit. Teacher Wang and I will help you. What? You just wanted to tutor her and use her results for betting. How could this happen? That's it. Great. Dad, you can't encourage them. They're having a tug-of-war, and they're treating me as the rope. I am the victim. It's not like that. They are like two runners in relay. You are the baton. As they run, you go forward. Dad, it doesn't make sense. They are like flogging me. Hsiao Ching, calm down. I just want to prove to Teacher Wang that rote learning isn't good education. If I win, I will release you from traditional education system. When did I become under such system? She's talking about the torment of the force-feeding education system. -Yes. -Mr. Wang, how come you've been supporting Ms. Chiang-wei recently? Not really. I am just interpreting her words. Is it because... you are dating? How impossible! Great. Great, if that's true. No. No. Too suspicious. He really cares about you. Really? Not really. No. Oh, I almost forgot. I have to go. I'll go now. My turn to tutor her? Yes. Yes. You forgot? I must be going. Take care and bye. I have an appointment. Where is she going? Hsiao Ching, what are you interested in? Me? Having fun. Go to movies, Internet cafes. Going live on the Internet is very popular. Have you tried it? Yes, with my friends. Hsiao Ching. You are a smart girl. You know what is right and wrong. Why do you care? God. You are ill? Cancer? I care about your conduct. I don't steal, fight, or lie. I'm not very good academically. I like having fun. I am not too bad, right? My dad told you something? Did he say... Complete this first, and we'll talk again. A mafia boss was recruiting a driver, but he doesn't like sissy ones. Siu Ming thought he was not a sissy, so he applied for the job. He got it. One day, he was driving his boss around. The boss said, "Siu Ming, turn right." Siu Ming turned right but found it was a dead end. He told his boss. "Boss, blind... Blind alley." Siu Ming got fired. It is girls' talk to mention "blind." What? What is it you need help? Nothing. Are you into Ms. Chiang-wei? Hsiao Ching. You should address her as Teacher Chiang-wei. Okay. Are you into Teacher Chiang-wei? You are too young to talk about this. Nonsense. My dad always worries about you not dating anyone. He worries. You don't know that. You look so good and smart. It is a pity from the biological standpoint. Kid, mind your business. I must teach you. Do you know where she just went? You need to impress girls by walking them home. She is now in my home. How can I do so? -Hi, Chiang-wei. -Hsiao Tieh. -What are you doing here? -You had a long day. Take a break. Thanks. -Let's go home together. -Sure. Isn't it a bit chilly? Yes. How was your day? It was okay. So strange. Is it not the right time? The Black Devil has already been arrested. No need to walk me home anymore. Thanks a lot. My pleasure. I should do this. Chiang-wei. I can protect you forever. Stop kidding. Good acting. Right. I should have been an actor, had I not become a prosecutor, and a good actor. I think so. But you should not practice on me. I can't take it. You are into what type of guys? What type? I like... someone I can connect with and understand, and more importantly, can live together comfortably. It must be someone with a strong sense of pride and confidence, but is willing to be vulnerable because of me. Sometimes we may argue, but he will secretly do something to please me. You are very clear. There probably is someone. Of course not. Just citing an example. So strange. How come I thought of Wang Chiang-ta? I think this person exists. -What? -You have clear descriptions. I think... this person resembles... me. Me. You are referring to me. -Right. -I think... I think you're... You do have a lot of good qualities. You are so fun, warm, and passionate. A lot of girls probably like guys like you. Come on, you represent them? However, they think I am... just a playboy and not serious about love. You just look like that. But you really aren't. You are very sincere. You are such a good guy. Very spot on. You are right. -Let's go home. -Okay. Oh, this. Not funny at all. You are such a good guy. You are very sincere. He likes to be flirty and the feeling of uncertainty. Why did you say he was sincere? He is not sincere at all. Who are you referring to? Nothing. Yes, I heard you. What is it? It is too dusty. I can't sleep. I want to sleep here. Okay. I got a question for you anyway. Okay. Let's chat on the bed. So comfy. -You sleep down there. -You... You are so bad. What is your question? -I need to ask you. -Go on. What type of guys do girls fancy? Are you serious? Of course, someone like me. Tall, handsome, and wise. Seriously, give me 30 minutes, I can court any girl. Really. So, your success rate is 100 percent. Yes. But I failed recently. Actually, I didn't. It is still 100 percent. Jealous? I am born like this. 100 percent is not true. Let me tell you. In the love system, you are now just at kindergarten level. I am a professional. Just like a doctoral degree holder. Seriously. Okay, fine. Let me ask you. What is your relationship with your girl? What is the status? Tomorrow, I will visit the lightless restaurant one last time. Sounds good. In my mind, I never consider one factor. What? The restaurant is moving. You are laughing? Just a dream. Told you that the chance is zero. I tell you what. Love is dependent on fate. Not possibility. If the dark queen knows that she means so much to you, then she would be happy. I have been curious about this person who talked to me. How does she look like? And it is such a pity that I couldn't unravel the mystery. You mathematicians are the same. Always looking for an answer. It is tiring. I hope you can have a new and normal relationship, okay? Right, I can introduce a lot of girls to you. This one is not bad. Sharon. Nor Nor. Wait, no, she is married. This one... also not bad. So many. Why don't you choose one? I have met my dream girl. She is the one. You want to know who? -I can tell you. -Goodnight. -Why not? -Goodnight. Let me tell you. Night. Also, there is Rui Rui. Yi Xiang? She got a boyfriend. This Black Devil is the guy from 20 years ago? Yes, positive. Did he reveal anything? Not really. There was no relaunch of the investigation. But in this case, the only convict, Chan Ting-hsuan, will be released on parole. Oh, really? Why are you interested in this case suddenly? Just helping a friend. Thanks. Let me treat you later. Goodbye. Hsiao Ching, come over. Did I pass? You have improved. Hsiao Chin, let me ask you. You are close to Hsiao Ching. Where do you two go after class? We come to class together. After class, she goes with some friends to an Internet cafe. Which one? Just at the train station exit next to a stationery shop. It is called Relaxing Time. The one Teacher Tseng was talking about. Okay, got it. Thanks. No problem. Teacher, you should ask her directly. She would tell you. -Goodbye. -Bye. This is a difficult question to solve. It means she deliberately got lower marks. What is she up to? Why did Hsiao Ching set up Teacher Tseng? Teacher Wang. -Teacher Tseng says-- -They say... if they don't get the money, they will send the pictures to this tutorial school. What should I do, Teacher Wang? If Hsiao Ching is the girl called Ming, we can't let this out. Teacher Tseng, don't worry. Leave this phone with me. Chiang-wei, let's go. Do I have to go? No, you will be discovered. You stay here. -Let's go. -Okay. Go to left to protect the dragon. Okay. You take the position on the right. -Got it. -Cover that position. Go. Your creditor is here. Really? What a coincidence. Go over there. The third guy is Ching's friend. -Has the teacher replied? -No. Nothing? Contact him again. Look. BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE YOU READ IT. NOT BOTHERED? NO 100,000 BY TOMORROW, PHOTOS WILL BE SPREAD. What are you? Return it! My phone. Will you tell Hsiao Ching? She was used by her friends. That boy said he will apologize to Hsiao Ching. Leave it to them to sort it out. So, though you suspected Hsiao Ching, you chose to believe in her. So you did not ask her. Because I thought it would not be useful. I like seeking the answer myself. No matter what, thank you. Sherlock Holmes. I can't take you back on this bike. You need to take a bus. What? I... just thought of a joke. What is it? One day in class, a student fell asleep. The teacher asked him, "Student, why so sleepy?" He replied, "My eyelids are ill." Then the teacher asked, "What kind of illness?" Guess what. What did he say? He said, "Self-blindness." You remind me of someone. Who? LIGHTLESS RESTAURANT What is it that requires an alarm? I forgot an important matter. I'll go now. How was it? Did you meet your dark queen? Too late. No. Too late? You've never failed to follow a plan until this time. You were so into her. What happened? Just late. You were late? It wasn't like you. Hsiao Tieh. What do girls fancy about you? This is not a question but an insult. I just don't get it. Let me tell you. Three factors. Handsome, good career, fun. Forget it. We are all different. Some are more adventurous. They enjoy controlling a bad guy. So it is still a probability issue. Did I mention probability? Probability again. Hey, Wang Chiang-ta. I think this case, even though everyone says it is a suicide, I don't think that it is. And most importantly, she is Chiang-wei's creditor, and that Sun... Asleep again? Every time you finish asking your question, you'd fall asleep. Let us sleep together. Hi. Morning, Tieh. I am free. Why? Oh, I just wanted to ask if what I just said, the grammar, was it right? Right. Actually, my English is... Is he teasing me? Right. I used to stay in New York. New York Tutorial School, I mean. Next to the station. -I'll look for my friend first. -Sure. Wang the Strong. -Catch you later. -Okay. -Morning. -Morning. She is looking at me. She is. You see. I got an urgent mail. This requires my endorsement to close. But this is a suicide case. Victim was a female. Her head was wrapped in a plastic bag attached with a tube, which was connected to a gas tank. No signs of physical injury or bruises. The victim was Sun. -Sun? -Yes. Chiang-wei's creditor? Such a coincidence. We just saw her yesterday. There is more evidence. All this points to... suicide. But a few days ago, she sent Chiang-wei a message asking about the compensation. She was so keen at the time. How could she have killed herself? See. Every piece of evidence is flawless. She even used her computer to type her will. It said, "I can't live anymore." She was murdered. Why? Too obvious. The nail polish. Could she have wanted to die in a nice way? That cotton ball. Between her toes. She was painting her toenails and used the cotton ball to keep it neat. If she has wanted to look nice when she died, she would have finished painting. Murder. Not bad, same as my thinking. Was Sun connected with the deception case? Hello. I already told you about the suspicion of murder. Investigate it. Don't treat it as suicide. Okay. Bye. You are good. Is that the student's speed dating program? What are you doing? You act as an instructor? This is the instruction for a thesis. I can't quit midway. And it is almost complete. But I still need some more information. Teacher Si-te. -Morning. -Can I... -Morning. -ask you for a favor? -You are here. -What is it? It's a long story, and there is some urgency. I can help. Me, too. Only Teacher Si-te can help me. -Only me? -Yes. What is it? You guys are willing to help, too? Yes. Follow me. What? To where? -What? -This way. -Keep going. -Okay. -Don't come in yet. -What are you doing? Very urgent. What is it actually that only she could help? Nothing. Where are you? Hsiao Ching, tell me. You, Mr. Hsun, and Teacher Wang, are you really close? Very. Because Teacher Wang' s mom passed away a long time ago. My dad and his dad were close friends. So my dad cares for Teacher Wang. We are like a family. Really? So, he is sometimes indifferent partly because he is lonely. So, Ms. Chiang-wei, you like him? Me... No worries. You can ask me anything. His hobbies, favorite types of girls. Don't misunderstand me. I'm not into him. You can't fool me. I can see it from your expression. I am not a rookie in love. It's just because we are colleagues. Even though it's not yet to the point of liking, there are friendly feelings, right? Let me tell you this. So that you don't fall into a trap. In two days, it is Teacher Wang's birthday. He doesn't like others to celebrate it. Don't give him any present. He doesn't want to celebrate his birthday? The day after tomorrow? The same day? Teacher Si-te. Hey. What kind of help are you doing for Teacher Wang? Oh, some silly questions. Like a set of questions in a survey. -Survey? -Yes. About what? What goes on between a man and a lady, which are something very silly. Is he counseling teenagers? Not possible. -Right. -I thinks he needs counseling. Why don't you ask him? Me... I asked him yesterday why he didn't ask your help. He said... it was enough to have me. I don't know. He's not investigating me, is he? I don't know if Sophie thinks academic results are important. At some point in life, results are proof of ability to excel. This will allow improvement. Yes. This is true, but this is not everything in life. At least this is my view. In a motor race, all the reporters asked the champion why he finished last in all the previous races but went on to win this one. You know what's his secret? The champion replied, "Oh, my car's brake was not working." Therefore, results are important, but they are not everything. Chiang-wei has said that before. No photo. And... Chiang-wei is always in a rush to leave on Wednesday and Friday nights. It matches her schedules. Now our hotline is open. Please call to share your stories. Hello, what is your name? Sherlock. Wow, a very special name. There are two famous Sherlocks. One is Sherlock Holmes. The other is Shylock from The Merchant of Venice. Their names sound similar. Yes. Which one are you? Sherlock Holmes. Oh, good thing you're Holmes, not the one in Shakespeare's story. That mean Sherlock. You thought of a funny joke? No. I just thought of my friend. He is completely the same as the Venice merchant. Very mean. So I address him as Shylock. This is what she calls me. Now I know it is not something nice. Sherlock, what do you want to share? You said results are very important, but they are not everything. In real life, without good results, a lot of things can't be achieved. Is he here to argue with me? If results aren't important, why are there tutorial classes? Sherlock, there are various educational methods, and I am against rote learning. It is only-- Tonight's discussion has gotten really heated. Is there anyone in the audience who also wants to share something? Their points of views are interesting. Our fans, please leave your messages. Discuss with us. Let's hear a song first. Commercial break. It must be Chiang-wei. Chiang-wei is the host of this. Interesting. I will use my name Sherlock to make fun of her. Come on. Let's eat. Try my special noodles. Chiang-ta, your noodles are ready. Ma'am, you are such a good cook. It's awesome to live with you. You are slick. Yes, super slick. I am being honest. The soup was super sweet. This is my favorite noodles. And ma'am, just... Smells so good. This is my seat. I have something to say to Chiang-wei. You can talk to her over there. -Chiang-wei. -What? Hsiao Ching's friend has already apologized. Great. -Problem solved. -Yes. And... I think Ching is covering up her real talents. What? I gave her a different test from others. No matter what level of difficulty, she scored the same marks. She did it on purpose. Maybe it was just a coincidence. She... keeps her marks at 50 so that she fails every time. This is not easy to do. First, she needs to know all the answers. Then, she determines the number of questions to answer. It can't be a coincidence. She... must have done it on purpose. Wow. You are a math professor who can use your knowledge in a practical way. Maybe she just got them right by chance. Let's do an experiment. All right. I have three cards. Two blacks, one red. You will close your eyes. Mrs. Kao and I will put one on your faces. Look at each other when you open your eyes. Then guess your own cards. Whoever is right first will win. Okay, close your eyes. Close your eyes. Now open your eyes. His is black. Mine could be black or red. Mine is red or black? The answer is already obvious. If you see the opposite's card is red, you will know that your card is black. because there is only one red. If the opposite's card is black, there are two possibilities, so you will hesitate. You're both hesitating now, so the answer must be... Black. -Really. -Yes. This is logical deduction. Okay, you're good. Girls should like smart guys. Chiang-wei. But... Chiang-wei... Is she into Hsiao Tieh? Ask her directly. Radio Host, if a guy is good at pleasing girls, is it more probable that girls fall for such a guy? I'm asking for a friend. Another Sherlock? But this one seems like an adorable teenager. It can't be generalized. If you like someone, you set your conditions and terms, and you can compromise. Seems like you are bothered. Actually, what you want to ask is whether the girl you like also likes you back. I said I asked for a friend. There was a girl who commended me for my view. It is possible that she likes me, right? Not necessarily. But it is a good start. How come? Strange. No more responses? Teenagers really have sensitive hearts. Hey, Chiang-wei. It is late. Go to bed. Hey. What about the water pipes? Have they been fixed? Almost. Both of the guys are good. However, it's not very good to stay here for so long and bother them. I know. I thought you were going out with Hsiao Tieh. But from what I saw recently, it seems to me that you like Mr. Wang. Me... He is a good guy and good to students. But I think I am not into him. Chiang-wei. You know it better than anyone. You are old enough to get married. Is there anyone who has made your heart beat faster? There is one. The stranger over there. We can't see each other anyway. We can talk if you want, but it's okay if we don't. Okay. Let's be ourselves. God, Chiang-wei, why do you keep thinking about that? You even dreamed of him? And also... Sober up! Stop it. Morning. -Morning. -Hsiao Tieh, morning. We prepared breakfast for you. Let's eat. Hsiao Tieh, you are a caring person. Thanks a lot. Don't mention it. Oh, where is Mr. Wang? He went out early. So early? Yes, actually, today is his birthday. But he doesn't want any celebration. How come? Because his father passed away on his birthday. Since then, he is like this. What a coincidence. Chiang-wei's parents also died on this day. Yes. What a coincidence. They died on the same day? Sister, brother-in-law, time really flies. But we have been fine this year. Chiang-wei found a good job. Please bless Chiang-wei to find her Mr. Right. You are in such a hurry to get rid of me? I still want more time with you. You are not young. No worries. Dad, Mom, although I haven't received my qualification as an official teacher, I am still going to teach. It's just that I'm teaching at a tutorial school. Dad, let me tell you some good news. My boss is your fan. He bought your painting. It was your boss? Yes. I feel like all of this was arranged by you, Dad. -Right? -Yes. Dad, it has been 23 years. I still want to find out the truth. Recently, we caught a person named Black Devil. He has new leads. That day at the riverbank, you were late. You told me it was 4:30. But the Black Devil said the Chief would meet up at 4:30. So, Dad, you were not that Chief. I believe there is only one truth. This is a theory I need to prove. Even if it takes me 20 years, or 30 years, I will prove your innocence. Dad, just wait. Mr. Wang. -Hi, ma'am. -Hey. What a coincidence. Chiang-wei's parents died on this day. -I see. -Yes. A big coincidence that it's the same day as your dad's. Coincidence? It's not that big. Come to think of it. There are so many urns here. And there are ten levels. Each year, there are 365 days, and those who died on the same day shouldn't be too few. Finding two people who died on the same day is actually highly probable. Please stop it. We bought you snacks. Enjoy them in the car. Thanks. Your car is arriving. Please take care. Come. Let me. Take care. -Tell me when you arrive. -Yes. Bye. How... old were you... You mean when my parents died? Yes. I was eight years old. How did it happen? They were killed in a fire. I don't know the details. -Don't know? -Right. I can't remember it. The doctor said I had a trauma. When I woke up in the hospital, my parents had already passed away. All the details were just told by my aunt. Hsiao Ching told me that your dad passed away accidentally. Yes. Dad, wake up! Dad! The world is so big. I know that meeting someone with a similar childhood experience is small. Not to mention that this happened on the same day. Hey. Tell me the probability of this in a population of seven billion. Not necessary. Why not? People meet one another. It's just 1 or 0. 1 means they meet. 0 means they don't. I'm glad to know we are 1 and not 0, Teacher Wang. Pleased to meet you. Chiang-wei. You, too. Radio Host. I'm not brave enough to tell you what's in my heart. I only know I like her. Can you be my girlfriend? That painting was among the Wang family's collection. I want to take revenge. It is just the right timing. Don't worry. I am here. If you go on, there is no going back. Subtitle translation by Dale Ko
