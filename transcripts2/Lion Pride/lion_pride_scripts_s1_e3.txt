 There is a thief in my tutor class. There are some things that will dig up deeper scars when brought up. It seems like you have nothing to do. Please take these quiz papers and correct them. Are you all right? You better leave your contact number. Didn't I tell you that I am being followed? I know who stole the list. Don't worry. I won't tell anyone. So you knew who stole the list?

 All right. After eliminating the square root of 3, we'll also cross out the square root of 2, to get the answer which is 2. So she is a student of Wang Chiang-ta's elite class. She has good grades. How could this kid steal a list? Yesterday, I spent a romantic evening with Wang Chiang-wei. We'll also apply simplification on the third item. Do we have an appointment? Can't I just come without one? Don't sit with me if you don't have one. Why do you need an appointment to sit together? With or without an appointment, I don't want to sit with you.

 With or without an appointment, whether it's the same table or not, I came here looking for you. Are you following me? Who wants to follow you? Hsiao Tieh told me you are here. So yesterday you've both been talking about me the whole night? Aren't you thinking too much? It's about me who is being followed recently. Hsiao Tieh said that he will help me. Hsiao Tieh has been doing overtime for you. Looks like this is not a simple matter. There must be some ulterior motive. You evil person... Forget it. I'm not here to argue with you. I have something important to tell you. I now know who stole the student list. Another uninvited guest. Teacher Wang. I've heard so much about you. I am Li Ta-shih of World Tutorial Classes. We have an excellent software and hardware equipment with plans of chain store exhibits. If you are willing to join us, then this blank check is yours. Wow... -"Li Ta-shih." -Uh. I know who you are. For example, you paid the students to steal the list from Chang-tai Tutorial Class. Is this a good trait of a teacher? You are not worthy to teach. Wow. Is he really the person I knew? I really can't understand what Teacher Wang is talking about. There must be some misunderstanding. Misunderstanding? No mistake. He even confessed. -What? -What? Are you still not leaving? Do you believe if I tell you that I'll report you to the ministry of education? Teacher Wang. I'll give you some time to consider. I'll come back to you later. Let's go. So... You already knew who stole the list? Is it that difficult? There can only be one answer. Niu Niu. How can you do this to me? -I... -Old Yen... Don't guess. It started from 3 to 4 p.m. in the afternoon. The footage during this time has already been deleted. So the crime must have happened on that hour The classroom has 12 surveillance cameras and the recorded footage returns to the reception. So in order to secretly delete the file, the best way is to cause a commotion and cover it up. Someone reported your fire-fighting equipment. This is inspection paper. How is it possible? You report to the boss. Hsiao Yu, come with me. The person who stole the list intentionally lodged a report. He dodged surveillance area and entered the counter. The person who deleted the surveillance record is the thief. As for the person who stole the name list, I've checked the student list of the tutor class. I found this student to be particularly suspicious. She transferred to Chang-tai this semester. She studied at World Tutor Class for one semester before the transfer. Our next step is to verify it. Please take a look at our equipment. WORLD TUTORIAL CLASSES Have you met up with this person lately? How did you find out? I am not as smart as you. I overheard it in the washroom. So you heard it. The chance of getting the right answer from overhearing can be determined using the probability theory created by Fermat, a French mathematician. Fermat brainstormed with European mathematicians about how questions and answers are correlated. At times, scientists, physicists, nature researchers, and mathematicians get their answers by... It looks like you are not concerned about these matters. But in fact, you are more zealous than anybody else. I am only interested in the truth. So you are a kind-hearted Sherlock. You even compared me to Sherlock Holmes. You have a good judgment. During my senior high school days, many schoolmates called me by the nickname of Sherlock. When we were young, we tend to exaggerate things. I am talking about the stingy character in Shakespeare's stories. Did you think I refer to Detective Sherlock Holmes? All right, whatever. Since Hsiao Hsin is identified as the person who stole the name list, how are you going to handle the case? Do you want to lodge a police report? As the truth comes to light, Old Yen has to follow up the case. Do you only care about the outcome? Hey. You are Hsiao Hsin's teacher. Don't you need to find out her motive? I've just taught her for several days. Do I have to care so much for her? Haven't you heard of the line, "Once a teacher, a father for a lifetime."? I am sure Hsiao Hsin knows more about the case. You must accompany me to visit her, or I will never let you go. So the incident that took place the other day, Teacher Wang actually saw it. Hsiao Chian, did you see anything? Not that I can't disclose it. But this is betraying a friend. Teacher Wang, Hsiao Chian and Hsiao Hsin are your students. What's your opinion? Hsiao Chiang, this is not betraying a friend. We want to help Hsiao Hsin, and to find out what troubles her. The reason she needs the money. Brother Chiang, since when did you start to care for us? Our Teacher Wang has been passionate about education. All right. On that very day... Surrender yourself, alright? Surrender? Don't be silly. Give me your mobile phone. What's the matter? Dad, please give me a ring. You must at least tell me your whereabouts. Please give me a ring. This name list could be able to help me. I knew who stole the name list. That's your doing. Don't accuse me. You have no evidence. I have no evidence, but I witnessed it all. This is why Hsiao Hsin stole the name list. I guess she's raising funds to let her dad flee. Since I discussed with Hsiao Hsin the other day, she has been playing truant. I rang her up but she didn't answer. You'd better quickly locate her. Speaking of which, can Hsiao Tieh check by using cell phone location? No way. This method involves privacy. You need to lodge a police report prior to the checking. So we can only look for her at her home. Let's go. Do I have to go? Of course. We need to discuss this. Can you let go of my hand? You are grabbing me as if I am a criminal. How about this? Would this be okay, Teacher Wang? Locking ten fingers together. Do you have Hsiao Hsin's info? I don't have it. I will ask from Niu Niu later. -HR info should be on the desk. -Yo... Teacher Wang. Do you two report to work together? Wow. Are both of you mingling well without our knowledge? -Not really. We met downstairs. -Well. I need his help. What? -We met coincidentally. -Agreed to meet downstairs. What? -I was at the bicycle parking corner. -When I was entering the elevator. -A heavy machine is parked there. -I saw him inside it. -So we parked bicycles at our slots. -So we took the same elevator. -At the entrance downstairs. -We're not reporting to work together. I ran into him when I was taking my bag. Hey, what are you two talking about? I am very confused. What are you talking about? Old Yen, don't you get confused. It's agreed that you could find your class teacher in three days. But Teacher Wang has been taking over for three days. Where is the class teacher? There's one who will report to work today. That's great. I can skip the classes of Wang Chiang-ta. No way. Things go on as usual. You both must not say no. All right. I will call it a day five minutes later. All right. -Big brother. -What? Big brother, take a look. I am calling it a day. Big brother, one moment. The report tracing Ms. Chiang-wei is out. Really? There's an 80% match on the facial expression. This is the person who is stalking Ms. Chiang-wei. Black Devil. We lost track of Black Devil earlier. But he's reappearing this time around. Clues for the earlier case will surface. What a godsent help! Good job. Hang on. Black Devil tracked Chiang-wei. What is his purpose? Wait a minute... she will be in danger if she is alone. No way. I must protect her. I am going to protect her, and... and we will... Thank you for sending me home. We need not thank each other. It's quite late now. You should take a rest. I'll go now. Hang on. Don't go. Do you want a cup of tea? Fine. I'll hit the road immediately. I'll follow you. Where are you going? I want to protect Ms. Chiang-wei too. No, thanks. How can you tell where I'll go? First, your facial expression tells it all. Second, I am a police officer and you are a prosecutor. It is a police's duty to protect a litigant. You're sick. Get lost. Hey. What's the matter now? Starting a rebel, huh? Can you quickly get lost? -Oh, my. -Don't get on my nerves. I warn you. I even forgot about it. I have Ms. Chiang-wei's phone number. You have Ms. Chiang-wei's phone number? Sorry, big brother. I'll ring her up now. Hey... Big brother, don't be impetuous, okay? Impetuous? When did you get her phone number? You're really shameless. Wang Chiang-ta. Oh, no. Go forward to rescue her. Within three to five steps, I can grab Si-te. So that she doesn't fall down. But the cup of coffee will spill. Due to the 40-degree angle, and my grasp is too tight for the paper cup, it will spill on Si-te. That doesn't work. How about throwing away the coffee cup? I'll reach her out within three steps. With the centrifugal force of my right leg, I can grab Si-te. Well... It doesn't work either. He is so mean. He's so different among his friends. Hsiao Hsue, may I have a cup of hot chocolate? -Is Fei mad? -Sorry, excuse me. Teacher Si-te. Prosecutor. You can call me Hsiao Tieh. -Or Tie. -Okay. Hsiao Tieh. You can call me Si-te. -Si-te. -That's right. -What a coincidence. -Yup. Well, ladies usually have several days of inconvenience each month. And the feeling of discomfort. All right. Please wait for me. Wait for a while. May I check if my hot chocolate is ready? Sir, your hot chocolate. Thank you. When ladies feel uncomfortable, it is good to have hot chocolate. You lack some iron. And I am the iron. Who told you that? This is common sense. Gentlemen should know this. Cool. -Thanks. -Welcome. You are really different from Wang Chiang-ta. Wang Chiang-ta is kind of weird. You can ignore him. All right. Why does he treat me well? Piece of cake. -Teacher Si-te. -Yes? Seems like you're in a good mood. Well... What are you adding? Does it taste good? Do you want to try it? -Let me share with you. -Sure. This is collagen powder. It comes with a mild milk taste. And it has ultra-low calories. We are teaching every day in air-conditioned classrooms. We have dry skin. -Yup. -Look at me. I saw improvement after drinking this. You can say I am without makeup now. You really care for your skin. We ladies have to treat ourselves well. -Chiang-wei. -Yes? Do you know what is special about women? Well... XX is our chromosome. You're not romantic at all. Oops, sorry. Let me tell you. Imagine this. When a lady meets the knight who is coming over to protect you, you will become a little princess. But I think that we ladies can also protect ourselves. Why must we be protected by knights? When you have a knight, you become a princess. Isn't that nice at all? I have practical thoughts, though. The values of two persons are more important. And the feeling when you're together. You haven't met your partner and you would say so. You can tell it when you met him. -Let's go. We have class now. -Sure. The number of formula is the same as the number of square root. What if this is a formula of infinite times? How do we find the root of N? For example, you paid the students to steal the list from Chang-tai Tutorial Class. Is this a good trait of a teacher? You are not worthy to teach. His words could be harsh. But in fact... he has his own charm. Second step, we'll look for coterminal angles. Take the angle plus the multiple of 360 degrees. Stop pushing me. We get the same angles here. Hey, keep quiet. Class, please take note. That's all for today. -Brother Tieh, bye. -Bye. -Brother Tieh, bye. -Bye. Don't go dating. Why are you two coming over? Because of you. We need to tell you an important matter. Why do you attend Chiang-ta's class all the time? I am listening to his lessons. I am his class teacher now. What's the matter? Yes. That's related to you. We discovered the person who's following you. -Really? -Yes. Hold on. Ms. Chiang-wei, it is with me. Please take a look. Why is it with you? -Where did you steal... -I printed it... Who is this person? -He is Black... -Black Devil. Why him? Who is Black Devil? Why is he following me? That's the thing. Why is he following you? -Fei and I are looking into the case. -Yes. Your safety is of utmost importance now. Your safety. I have checked the surveillance record around your house. I am checking most of those records. From my judgment, he's following you home -to find out where you live. -Yes. His intention is very clear. You must be careful. -Really. -Really? Black Devil goes to her house. That's right. So I came over here myself to protect Chiang-wei. Well, I feel embarrassed. Don't feel embarrassed. Prosecutors give orders to the police. This is a normal matter. Protecting you is also a part of my job. It's also part of my job. All right. It's late now. I am worried that you go home alone later. Do you want to send me home? Not only I am sending you home, I am also protecting you as you go home. Well. I don't find the situation to be so dangerous. That's right. Is this necessary? Big brother, is this necessary? When the police is handling a case, outsiders should just stay away. Let me tell you. You have to trust me. What's the problem now? Can't create a chance for me? You're blocking my way... How about this? Wang Chiang-ta is also coming along. He protects you, I protect him. So I'll protect Brother Chiang. No, thanks. Brother Chiang is great. He can fight ten bad guys at once. So you should go home earlier. Take a shower and sleep earlier. So that you'll be energetic tomorrow, okay? Let me send Fei out. Go home. Let's go. Ms. Chiang-wei. I am home now. Thank you both, gentlemen. I am heartened that you sent me home. You may go home now. -Bye. -Chiang-ta, hang on. I think something is not right. I've managed many cases. Some robbers intruded empty houses. If they are still inside, when a lone girl like you goes home, they will rob and molest you. So I insist to get in and protect you. So that you survive the night. Can a prosecutor threaten others? Why are you frightening me? Did I frighten you? I once handled a case. It was a murder case. Back then... What are you doing? I think I smell blood. -It seems to linger in my... -Stop with your acting. -No. I think the blood smell... -Traces of intrusion... Quiet... They sneaked into my house. Your balcony window is broken. The thieves entered from there. Everything in the house is overturned. Please check if you lost anything. Hold on. I'll report to my bureau. So that my colleagues cordon off this area. We'll get them to collect evidence. Remember, don't touch anything. Oh, my... My favorite bag. Why is it ripped? Don't touch it. As I said just now, don't touch anything. All right? Sorry. Doesn't matter. Luckily, I don't have precious things. And I am neck-deep in debt. I have no money to be stolen. When you think of it, Black Devil is fleeing now. He must be trying to get some money to escape. No. He is looking for something. But why? Everything inside the house has been overturned. Places that are not meant for precious things, he combed through them too. He cut your bag because he couldn't find what he needs. So he vented his frustration on this. What is he looking for? Get the surveillance records. Confirm if he did it. Otherwise, we are merely guessing. Would that person return? He found nothing and destroyed things around. Given such character, he will return, most likely. I'll get officers to collect evidence. You can no longer stay in this house. Where am I going to stay? Come to my place. -What? -What? Well. We have an empty room, right? -Keeping miscellaneous stuff... -That's my place. My place is your place. How about tidying it? That is my place. You don't get it? She needs help now. Tidy up and it becomes a room. She is a girl. That's right. She is a girl. And she needs help now. She must have her own friends. She could be friendless. We could be her only friends. Don't we have an obligation to help her? Help others as much as you can, and send deities back to heaven. Your brothers will appreciate your help. It is okay for the time being. My friend isn't really good with words. He says, "for the time being", but the length of it isn't the issue. The priority is for you to enjoy your stay and feel free. All right? Also, with the two of us protecting you, you can be rest assured. Furthermore, I am a prosecutor. All right. I'll take my stuff. Hold on. There is a pair of slippers. Take a rest in the living hall. We'll tidy up the room. -Okay? -Yup. All right. I think I'll be cleaning the room alone. What a merciless guy. Thanks. Say thanks to Hsiao Tieh. Gratitude or resentment, I know where to draw the line. I will remember how you helped me. However, your payable compensation, you still need to repay it. Okay? If you can't repay it, there is an alternative. I might move out of my rented place and rent your place instead. I won't pay rental anyway. I'll stay until all 100,000 dollars are deducted. How about that? How many times do I have to repeat it? I have nothing to do with this matter. Also, let me remind you. It might be inconvenient for a girl like you to stay here. Hsiao Tieh. Aren't we always walking in the house naked? That's right. Do you think I am afraid when you say that? You should be afraid. Our place is in the vicinity of mountains. There are many lizards. Lizards. I am not afraid of lizards. There is one crawling on your leg. Come on. Who would believe such an old trick? You... What are you two doing? Are you... Lizards. No. Sofa. She said she is not afraid of lizards. Wang Chiang-ta, how dare you use such an old trick? You... I'll take a shower now. Shower? -I'll get in the room. -Keep acting as you like. All right. Straightforward attitude. I like it. Wow. Did you all just tidy up this room? It looks clean. Not really. The storage room is not the place for you. Of course, I'll take the storage room. This is my room. I see. But I feel embarrassed. I am just staying for the time being. I should be the one sleeping in the storage room. Please don't say so. Because of your short stay, I am obliged to not let you take the storage room. Spare the words. Enjoy it. Call me when you need help. -You're good. -Pardon? You're different from Wang Chiang-ta. Chiang-ta is also a good person, but he is kind of weird. Please bear with him. I think you're better than him. Why is that? You care for girls. You're loyal to your brothers. You work hard. You exercise your power impartially to protect the safety of the people and their assets. And you are handsome with a fit physique. You are my fantasy. Those are all but honors. I am doing my duty as a man. Ms. Chiang-wei's appreciation is really out of my expectation. All right. It's late and I shall leave now. Tieh. Thank you so much for today. I don't know what to do without your help. But is this place safe? Could Black Devil be following us here and trying to take action? It is not safe. But I am here to protect you. So, tonight... you can stay and accompany me here. This is my room. Of course. Hey... Are you all right? I am fine. Are you willing to provide half of the payment? Did you say anything just now? Well... Nothing. You are a good guy anyway. Thank you. My pleasure. Chiang-ta is also a good person. But he is kind of weird. Please bear with him. Doesn't matter. Don't talk about him. All right. It's late now. I shall go now. Hold on. Anything now? Need my protection? Well... Doesn't matter. I want to know the way to the bathroom. I need to use it. Turn left. Then, turn left again, go straight and you'll see it. Thank you. Hey! Why are you shouting? I am being polite not to call you a pervert. Do you open the door when you are taking a shower? Miss, this is my place. I know this is your place. But I am also staying here. You... put on your clothes now. I thought someone said she is not afraid? I am not afraid. I am not used to it. Quickly put on your clothes. My towel is over there. -Where is it? -In front of you. I can't go out if you don't take it for me. Hang on. Don't you move or walk in. I can't get your towel without moving. Stretch your hand further. There is a 3cm gap between our hands. What 3cm now? You thought everybody's brain is the same as yours that runs like a calculator? I've used up all hot water. Hey. Why didn't I walk away just now? Why didn't I ask her to get out? Why did I take his towel? -Why the blush now? -Why the blush? Tieh is really annoying. He brought home a flower with a thorn. What now? Nothing. Let's share the bed tonight. No way. Can't you sleep in your own room? Well... The storage room is so packed. I can't tidy it up tonight. So I let Chiang-wei sleep in my room. That's why you should take the storage room. You let go of your room. I didn't let go of mine. You are so mean. Well... Let me share your room. No way. I gave in a lot today. Go to the storage room. One, two, three. Just a while. Let me tell you. I am so pitiful. Locked. I am being polite not to call you a pervert. Oh, my. Wang Chiang-ta is really too much. Dates before mates. But hey. Dates before mates should be a comment for me. But anyway... Why am I so miserable? I have neither dates nor mates. I am on my own. I can't bear it. Unbearable. You are... not sleeping well? Well... I only sleep well in my own bed. How about you? Well, because that I... have a new housemate and I feel glad about it. I feel kind of excited about it. So I can't sleep well. I see. How about you then, Chiang-ta Da? You can't sleep well on your conscience? It's not my sleeping time yet. I see. Oh, yes. You said Black Devil is looking for something. What is he looking for? -Wang Chiang-wei -Huh? When you ran into Black Devil in the cafe, were you using the same bag that was ripped earlier? Well... It seems so. Think about it carefully. Did you accidentally take his stuff? Impossible. I don't know him. But the bag you are using now has been changed. That's right. I subsequently took a new bag. Let me take it over. You have an umbrella and a raincoat with you. Yes, because I am usually riding YouBike. Raincoat is convenient for me. You have two raincoats. Do I have two? Yup. This is bag is suspicious. Here comes the answer. Black Devil was working on a drug deal that day. The police broke in to arrest them. Amid the hurry, he kept his drug in your bag. Since he is now on the run, he needs it to get cash. The drug lord might suspect he pocketed all the profits. No wonder he is so anxious. -It turns out to be... -I'll call for help, so the officers can check this fingerprint. Also, this is evidence to charge Black Devil. Thank you. Don't mention it. Well... How about... we watch TV together? -All right. -Okay. This looks good. All right. Children smile happily without worries. Throughout one's lifetime, that's the happiest time. Not necessarily though. -Hi, boss. -Hi. What do you need today? This one. How much are all these? These are... -Mom, he's cheating. -I don't sell now. Don't ask why. -Go away now. -Don't push my mother. You kid, what are you shouting? Such a bad kid. Like father, like son. -What do you mean? -What I mean? Your husband is a corrupted policeman. He was involved in group robbery and murder cases. His son wouldn't be good either. Don't accuse blindly. Don't move. You have to trust Father. Father is no bad person. He is not evil. Definitely not. Wang Chiang-ta. Let me tell you. I suffer from anemia since I was young. Doctors always remind me to take food with high iron contents. That is why when I take the high-speed rail, I usually eat five lunch boxes. And I became healthier and stronger. I overheard it. You two are chatting happily here. Chatting and laughing. What are you two chatting? -Nothing. -We're not chatting. Not chatting? I heard it just now. High-speed rail. You two are planning for a trip. About to stay overnight elsewhere? And I am not invited. How is it possible? Wang Chiang-ta, you are really too much. You're wooing girls stealthily. Hey... Wooing girls stealthily. You're exaggerating. It is here. Hello. Are you Hsiao Hsin's mother? Yes. Both of you are... We are teachers from Chang-tai Tutorial Class. Hsiao Hsin has been absent for several days. So we decided to visit your home. -Is she not attending classes? -Yup. Please come on in. So she has been cheating me. Oh, my. Where has she been going? Could Hsiao Hsin be looking for her father? That guy dares to resurface? We're divorced now. I have custody of the daughter. How can he meet with my daughter without my consent? Excuse me. May I use your washroom? It is at the back. Teacher, let me tell you. He was like that since we first married. He went out three or four days. There were photos on the wall. She didn't want others to see them. So she took them down. There were photos on the windows. Hsiao Hsin cared for her mother's feeling. So she took them down. Hsiao Hsin is doing well in twelfth grade. But why she put tenth-grade English on her desk? TENTH-GRADE ENGLISH Black Devil is Hsiao Hsin's father. Please take a look. Hsiao Hsin took and sold the name list. I think she did it for her father, Black Devil Pai Wen-liang. She is raising funds for her father to escape. We can track her using Hsiao Hsin's cell phone. We could find her, and possibly Black Devil. All right. I'll apply for court order and search warrant. Could Hsiao Hsin be dragged in the case? Well, she is still a teenager. What she did was for the sake of her father. Juvenile court might give her a warning or transfer her to counselors. But she will not be imprisoned. How about after counseling? She won't have a criminal record. All right. For the remaining part, we police officers will take charge. -You two should leave now. -No way. She is my student. I want to follow up. Same here. The case involves Black Devil. You guys are really... Turn right at this juncture. If the target is not moving anymore, ask spies and police to lock down the location. -All right. -Cordon off front and back exits. -Got it? -All right. We shall check commanding height around the area. I worry if Black Devil is armed. Be careful. How many police officers are deployed? Big brother, rest assured when Fei is taking charge. -All right. -Hey. If Black Devil appears, we arrest him in front of Hsiao Hsin. Would she find it unbearable? Hsiao Hsin is no longer a little girl. She could distinguish what's right and wrong. Hsiao Hsin's position is stagnant now. -What's her location? -Wuchang Street. It could be the place they agreed to meet up. All right. Hsiao Tieh. As her teacher, I will talk to Hsiao Hsin first, while you guys wait for a while. Hey. Do care for her feelings. All right. Fei, please stop in front. All right. You two are taking charge, Fei and I are your drivers, right? -Hsiao Tieh. -What? We'll pull over here. Fei, you are pulling over. Huh? You... Chiang-ta, be careful. Chiang-ta... Why is he suddenly becoming zealous? That's his usual style. I'll follow him. -Ms. Chiang-wei. -Chiang-wei. You two can't take things in your hands. Is she carrying cash with her? Black Devil. Dad, this is for you. What is this? What is he investigating? It involves lots of secrets. You should only open it later. Don't open it here. What's with the secrecy? Dad, since we haven't met for some time, how about having a meal? Please. Next time. You keep saying next time. So did the last time. You made me wait for three years. Shall we inform Hsiao Tieh? -Hello. -Hello, Wang Chiang-ta. I saw both of you. Fei and I are at the shop next to you. I warn you not to take action hastily. I'm unsure if Black Devil is armed. You must not forget that he and... I am Hsiao Hsin's teacher. I am doing my duty. You should not act hastily. Don't arrest suspect in front of my student. Wang Chiang-ta. Are you trying to... Hey, are you out of your mind? What if he is armed? He is unarmed. The probability is 90 percent. Wait for Hsiao Tieh before taking action. I am not waiting. Hey. -Big brother. -Huh? Chiang-ta and Ms. Chiang-wei entered the shop. Shall we follow up? Let me take a look. Hello, Mr. Pai. I am Teacher Wang from Hsiao Hsin's tutor class. Let's eat together, if you don't mind. Mr. Pai, I am Hsiao Hsin's history teacher. I think we have met before. Really? You have mistaken. I'll leave now. Catch up next time. Wait a minute. You left a pack in Teacher Wang's house. Don't you want it now? Where's the stuff? We'll talk later. All right. Mr. Pai. Do you know Hsiao Hsin's results? She didn't tell me. She's doing well, always scoring 90 marks and above in class tests. Really? You're smart. If she maintains the performance, she'll get admitted into a national university. Really? Why didn't you tell me? You're doing well in your studies. I feel so proud. You didn't ask me, and we rarely meet up. How am I going to tell you? Well... If you ask me next time, I will tell you. Eat more. I'll bring you a good meal next time. Well... I didn't study much. I wish both teachers could teach her more. Children are not born to be taken care by teachers only. Parents should take up greater responsibilities than teachers do. You are right. But I am... If children make a mistake, parents have a duty to correct them promptly. You have a chance now. Hsiao Hsin. Do you want to say it out? Or let teachers speak up? -Big brother -Yes. Black Devil is a wanted criminal. Are they in danger now? Wang Chiang-ta is very smart. He knew Black Devil went there unarmed. He won't want to take risks. -That's true. -All right. It's about time now. Pay the bill. Huh? Big brother. I don't have money. Let's meet them up. Dad should apologize to you. Since you were little, I have never brought you out for meals. Neither did I fulfill my responsibility as a father. You are eager to know the truth. You pretended to be generous and pulled me out. You even said you want to give her some space. I haven't even ordered food. Did I pretend to be generous? Let the father and his daughter talk in private. This is just a simple thing. All right? You even care for the basic human right of a wanted criminal. Are you not worried if he flees? Would he flee? Would he come out if he wants to flee? They told me this. Slot the pen drive into the computer and the hacker's formula will initiate. The passcode will be cracked. The download is swift and it will never be discovered. The point is that it has a lot of money. So I think I can help you this way. Throughout my lifetime, I know nothing but crimes. I am wanted now, and I need my daughter to help a criminal like me. I am really useless. I've failed big-time. It doesn't matter if you are a criminal. You are my father. It is a crime if you steal a class list. You must not do such a silly thing. Look at me. Don't follow my footsteps. Halfway through my lifetime, I started to regret it. You are so smart and you're doing well in your studies. You'll have many options and opportunities in the future. Dad is proud to have a daughter like you. Speaking of which, how did you calculate the probability of Black Devil being unarmed? You said it is 90%. That's a wild guess. Hey... Frankly speaking, when we visited Hsiao Hsin's home, I saw her birthday cards from Black Devil. While the sender's address was not written, the postmarks showed that the cards were sent from different places. Those letters have one thing in common. Before Hsiao Hsin's birthday, the cards were sent to her home. Black Devil is a wanted criminal. But his parental heart and his love for his child do not change at all. You... could put yourself in her shoes. Yes. Dad, what are you doing? -Is this okay? -No way. Do you want to clash with me? -I've taken over. -No way... This is not Chinese chess. Not Chinese chess. Yup. Since ten years old, my father was suspected to be involved in a crime. Since then, I am called as a suspect's son. On my shoulders I carried the weight of a cross. I don't want innocent children to go through the same. Given Teacher Wang's hints, I think I got his point. I don't think I can't flee today. Don't be sad. If I flee, you can't find me. But if I surrender now, you can see me in prison. Fei, wait a minute. Let's go. How is it now? On top of the crimes he is wanted for, as well as drug trade, Black Devil admitted them all. As for the case 20 years ago, he didn't elaborate clearly. No information was obtained. Didn't you say that he once mixed with Chan Ting-hsuan? That's right. But he was adamant that he wasn't involved in the case. Until new evidence surfaces, there is nothing we can do about it. Chiang-ta, we have tried our best. I can tell you one matter, though. I heard that Chan Ting-hsuan might be released on parole soon. -About that time, how about... -You said Chan is to be released. Yup. He behaved himself in jail. His application has been approved. -Hsiao Tieh. -Huh? Please. Let me meet Black Devil. Is it okay? Okay. It's their meal time now. I can cover up a bit. You must do it quickly. -Is it okay? -All right. Okay. Teacher Wang, why are you here? I want to tell you something about Hsiao Hsin. By criminal code, she is not an adult. She behaves herself. She could be placed under custody. As if the civil case, I'll persuade Tutor Class not to pursue the case. That's great. Thank you, Teacher Wang. I have a presumptuous request. I hope you can help me. What's the matter? SUSPECT CHAN ARRESTED IN WANG FAMILY MURDER CASE 23 years ago, there was a robbery and murder case. A suspect was arrested. His name was Chan Ting-hsuan. I know you know each other. I want to find out if you are involved in the case. Well... This matter is crucial for me. If you can tell me, it will be of great help. I won't disclose this to anybody else. I promise. Prosecutors asked me about the case. Not that I kept quiet to dodge punishment, I knew nothing much, indeed. So you knew it. Yes. I knew it. The case caused the death of three persons. But I didn't kill anyone and I had no evidence. So I kept quiet to save the trouble. Since Teacher Wang wants to know it, I can disclose everything. Thank you. I am Chan Ting-hsuan's junior. He took good care of me. They wanted to intrude an empty house that day. There were many antique items. They needed a lookout to keep an eye. So he brought me along to make some money. Shortly after they entered the house, I heard shooting. Chan then came out and told me, their plan was screwed. I was a driver fetching them to gather at the warehouse. Chan's leg was shot. A shooting was heard in the middle of the night. Chan told me it was gang in fighting. He asked me to flee the scene. That was how things developed. Furthermore, I only knew Chan. I didn't know the others. That's all I know. How about the antique back then? I sold most of them. A jade eagle was broken into half. The black market refused to buy it. At first, I kept it in an aquarium, and in a bed cabinet subsequently. Hsiao Hsin can get it for you. Also, when Chan Ting-hsuan was arrested, his statement said that a policeman was involved in the case. He was nicknamed Chieftain. He was shot and killed outside the warehouse. Was his statement true? I heard from them that a policeman was involved. Can you sure that he was a policeman? I didn't know him and I had never seen him. All I had was hearsay. All right. Can you recall the time of the case? We gathered outside the main entrance. Chan told me that it would be done within one hour. I checked my watch. It was half past four. That was the time when dad was with me. So he couldn't be Chieftain. You didn't know the policeman who was killed. I only knew Chan. Do you know this person on the photo? -I don't know him. -Think clearly. Have you seen him? I have never seen him before. Sorry, please think clearly. Have you seen him? I have never seen him. When the case took place, did you see this person? He did not turn up when the case took place. He was the policeman who was killed. Do you know who he is? I didn't see him that day. Think about it clearly. Look at this photo. Is he Chieftain? Did you know him? -He was the police killed outside. -I didn't see him. -Do you know? -Chiang-ta... Your time is up. Uncle Hsun, how was my father's relationship with his fellow officers? Did he offend someone? Your dad upheld loyalty. He had a sense of justice. I don't think he offended anyone. Hsiao Tieh arrested someone today. He was involved in the case many years ago. Black Devil. Black Devil? Black Devil Pai Wen-liang. Did you talk to him? Yes. I am firm that my dad is innocent. Any clear evidence? Or did he mention... that someone set your dad up? No. Black Devil said he was monitoring the situation. He said he saw nobody. It was many years ago. Had I stayed in police service, I could have found some clues. Black Devil was not involved, but arrested now. The key person Chan Ting-hsuan is about to be released on parole. This could be a turning point. Chan Ting-hsuan to be released on parole. Tao Le-si has learned something today. I can't wait to share with our audience. Prejudice can be changed. Good and evil are not what they seem to be. It is not black or white. To see is to believe, as everyone says. Occasionally, this might not be the case. Heaven gave us different senses. More importantly, our feelings. As Little Prince said, "It is only in the heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye." Important matters are intangible. Old Wang and Old Li love playing baseball. They always discuss whether baseball teams exist in heaven. Old Wang passed away one day. He gave Old Li a dream. He wanted to share a good news and a bad news. Tell me the good news then. Good news is baseball teams exist in heaven. And the bad one? Next Wednesday, you will be the lead player. What joke is this? Hey, I spent some time to search for this story. Can you explain it to our audience? You explain to them. This is... This is your... Is an explanation necessary? It is late now. Please be careful if you are going home now. Tao Le-si wishes everybody a good dream. Why do I have to come along to meet her up? You can leave then. Nothing... Oh, my. This lane is so dark. It is dangerous if she walks alone. How do you tell she is coming home this time? I thought you are an observant? You don't know about her schedule. Let me tell you. She comes home by bus at this hour every day. She'll appear shortly. -Even if I know it... -Do you believe me? I wouldn't want to wait here. Why do I need to observe her schedule? You are so girly. You are really... I mean it doesn't take much of your time. We are just walking and chatting. Okay? Hey. She's back... Look at her joyful eyesight. She's looking at me. She is looking at me. Why are you two waiting for me today? I worry about your safety. He is just passing by. It is dim here. Remind the head of the borough to set more street lights. Let's save electricity, since I'll be sending Chiang-wei home every day. Why do you treat me so well? It's my duty as a man. It's his trick to woo girls. Wang Chiang-ta, you... Mind your words. Chiang-wei, please trust me. I am a loyal man. A loyal gentleman. All right. I trust you. Stop sabotaging. I warn you. Sabotaging is nothing, if you are good enough. Given that you two came over to send me home. You two take a shower first, while I prepare supper. Wang Chiang-ta, your favorite supper. Aunt, why are you here? You are preparing supper while they are... taking a shower. Well... Is the... the cleaner? She's my real aunt. Good day, aunt. You all are... The three of you stay under the same roof? We are... We are... They said if they're not receiving money, they'll send photos to Tutor Class. What's your ideal guy like? Do you like Teacher Chiang-wei? Black Devil was the person 20 years ago. Are you involved with one of them? We are just friends. I will protect you for the rest of my life. Subtitle translation by BK Yeow
