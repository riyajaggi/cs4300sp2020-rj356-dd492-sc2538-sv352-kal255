 Kuan Ching-ching! This quiz is quite difficult. Watch out if your daughter is doing something. Si-te, let's go. A good day with good food. I'm lucky indeed. If I eat with you every day, I will suffer from gastroenteritis. Well... You can just watch me eat. That would reduce your chances of suffering from gastroenteritis. Chiang-ta, you can't stop smiling.

 Because... Dorothy is here. You should be with him all the time. He has been alone for a long time. The best thing about my boyfriend is that he picks a girlfriend wisely. Chiang-ta, Chiang-wei, you two are in love now? You came home after curfew. It's not safe for a girl. Hsiao Chien, you better come home earlier. So that your father won't worry. Sure. Chiang-wei, Chiang-ta falls in love for the first time. He is not romantic, please bear with him. I am always bringing you out for meals. Is it not romantic?

 Not really. Really? Yes. All right. Let me ask you. Do you know what door is produced with wood? Wooden door. Yes. And those made with glass? Glass door. What about door made with happiness. Happiness... Happiness door? No. What is it? It is... us. Yes. As long as I can make you smile. What is happiness? You... are the answer. -You may eat more. -Try some. You worked with the outsiders to set me up? Didn't I treat you well? Why do I have such an unfilial daughter? I am unfilial if I did not stop you from doing illegal works. How dare you talk back? Did your new friends encourage you to set me up? They're not involved. Let me tell you. Your father is righteous and ethical. I am not afraid. Dad. I know you use dirty tricks to make money. Could you please stop it? So that we lead a peaceful life. You denied yourself a peaceful life. You made a big mistake! You are my daughter. Who else could protect you? Stay here for several days. Ponder about it. Bin, confiscate her cell phone, papers and a pen. Do not let her contact the outside world. Dad, you want me to stay here? GOLDEN JADE HALL Watch out. Lock the door. Dad. Miss, your cell phone. BLACK GHOST PAI WEN-LIANG CHIEF? CONFIRMED AS COP? SUSPECT DEAD? OLD YEN HSIAO WEI "Eight-year-old daughter Wang Hsiao Wei was rescued." Did they have a daughter? "Wang Hsiao Wei." Chiang-wei. On Kuan Ching-ching's case, if the murderer was not discovered, would you still be suspected? I didn't do that. There must be evidence to prove the truth. I worry if public opinion could affect your life. I have been reminding myself to be stronger, so nothing can affect the calmness in my heart. Do you trust me? Of course. I trust your every word. Every topic you discussed with me, I find it all interesting. You analyzed every theory and I find it so meaningful. It's because... I like you. Big Cat. You know this. Not everybody can understand what's in my mind. Thank you. Hsiao Wei. You took the initiative to open the door in my heart. Well, let me accompany Big Cat Sherlock to search for the truth. Let me help you. We will get rid of your status as a suspect. Hsiao Wei. I am the son of the suspect of Wang family murder case. I'm going to clean this mess that troubled me for 20 years. Would you wait for me? Aren't you two so lovely? It is late already. Do not disturb our neighbors. Do that at home. You might need a room. What's the matter? You feel embarrassed? Did you appear all of a sudden to frighten us? You are Wang Chiang-ta. Since when did you become so timid? You must be stronger to protect Chiang-wei. Or should I protect Chiang-wei instead? I'm worried that you won't survive long. Oh, my... Someone likes you and you are so proud now. I am a big lightbulb. During a cold weather like this, I become your lightbulb. It is not bad, is it? Let me shine on the two best friends in my life. You are a sun. Not just a lightbulb. You talk so sweet. Wang Chiang-ta, do you feel warm? You have a good control over the temperature. You must not fall in love with me. Hey! Hey! Oh, no. This would work, right? Someone would pick up a money. Let me add NTD 50. Yes! Oh, please. Hey. You all have crossed the line. It is okay if a history teacher is absent, but the top math teacher was replaced! And now even your English teacher is absent. This is like cheating. I want a refund. Mrs. Chang. Right now. Process it for me. Give her the refund. A refund for Mrs. Chang. Give it to her. Mrs. Chang. Hello. Are you the boss of Chang-tai Tutorial Class? Are you a parent coming over for a refund? I am here to discuss win-win business collaboration. Win-win? Our purpose is to help students learn efficiently. We select good teachers carefully, so that they'll record vivid and well-understood teaching videos. Each clip is five to ten minutes. The teachers will explain the main points. As students watch the video clips, they will then sit for a test. They will practice what has been taught. Do you also work with World Tutorial Classes? That's right. We work with each tutorial classes. We want the students to have more learning opportunities. We have been planning to work with Chang-tai Tutorial Class. Because you have Chiang-ta for Math and Si-te for English. You have good teachers. And the students admire well-known tutors. Not to forget Chang-tai for Chinese Language. Oh, my. He's my savior. He can boost our tutors' popularity. That is a great plan. We shall work together. How do we start? If you're interested, Mr. Yen, we'll make an appointment to discuss the details of business collaboration. This is good for the students. We'll work together. LINKOU SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL Hello? How's the interview? It went on smoothly. I am Wang Hsiang Wei, right? Hsiang Wei. Are you crying? No. You're wrong. You're using your reasoning on your girlfriend. But I am just fine. The bus is coming. -Bye. -Hang on. Obviously, she's crying. What's the matter? Where does Chiang-wei go when she is sad? She's 99% likely to visit Jiannan Mountain of Dorothy. Aiguo West Road, please. I will bring you to the Underworld Road. Chan Ting-Hsuan, you... Help! Where are you going? You better behave. I... Get in. Chan, listen to me. You always thought I pulled the trigger. You found the wrong person. I didn't even have a gun. Think of it. Had I been holding a gun that day, when we quarreled, I would have used my gun to fight against you. Think about it. Yen was so timid and coward. He was always trying to confirm if we were breaking into an empty room. When we got exposed, he overpowered the lady. Boss Sheng-li pulled the trigger. When they quarreled with me, one person took a knife, while the other took a gun. If he was armed, why didn't he take it out? Think about it. According to what we agreed, we would meet at the warehouse. The chief did not arrive. He did not come over. And then you heard gunshots and you automatically accused me. Your leg was shot and you accused me. Come on. I didn't even have a knife. Let alone a gun. Shut up! Yen-pa fired a gun, he double-crossed us. Hsiao Chan, don't talk nonsense. Be careful or I'll kill you! Hsiao Chan! Fucking Yen-pa! You just want to take all the stolen goods. Black Ghost is your friend. He stayed with you, so it can't be him. But the chief didn't appear. It can't be him, too. And it couldn't have been me because I didn't have a gun. Think about it. Who really fired the gun and harmed you? Chan. Are you saying that the boss shot me? I don't know. If you are right, why would he deceive us? I don't know! Before you kill me, you must check things thoroughly. For this case, I will investigate thoroughly. Also, Wang Chiang-wei of your tutor class, is she the orphan of Wang family murder case? You even know it. Let me tell you. We did something wrong. She lost her family. We must repent our sin. You must not interrupt her. I'll tell what, if you target her, you can set me up. Do not touch her! You want to protect her even if you're dying? Chan! We did something wrong. We destroyed her family. We have a price to pay. You were imprisoned for more than 20 years. You've repented your sin. You must turn a new leaf and start a new life. You are in no position to advise me. I am no better than you are. I'm scared. Really scared. I... I thought I could take it as if nothing happened. Things will fade away. But now I realized, wrong deeds do not fade away. I have a price to pay, too. I am willing to become a good person. What you told me just now, I will verify it by myself. I'll leave you alone today. If I find out that you are fooling around with me, you will be doomed. Chan. Don't move! Chan. For how long are you going to confine me? Chan! Chiang-ta is a Math professor. But I can't even become a senior high school teacher. Wang Chiang-wei. You are useless. Forget it. I should not waste my tears on things in the past. I must cheer up! Chiang-wei! Chiang-ta. Chiang-ta! Why are hitting him? Stop it! Why are you here? I just saw a snake. I was about to rescue her. You must find out what is going on first. How could I trust your words? I'll deal with you later. Who is he? Don't run away. Chiang-ta! Don't run away. Chan Ting-hsuan, stand still. Chan Ting-Hsuan. Get up. You're really stubborn. You just got released, but you're messing around again. You were about to attack Chiang-wei. I'll never let you go. What are you laughing at? What are you laughing at? I didn't know why before this, but when I saw that you cared for Wang Chiang-wei, I finally understand it. You are the son of the murderer. You fell in love with the daughter of the victim. Is this your intention? You want to protect her, so that you can repent the sin of your father? What are you talking about? My dad is not a murderer. Your dad was the chief. You knew it in your heart. Don't tell me that you know nothing. Old Yen and Black Ghost said that only Boss Sheng-li knows who the chief is. You knew nothing at all. You have to stop talking nonsense. Am I talking nonsense? He was the only cop in the scene. Do you have evidence to prove he was not the chief? You may prove it. Do you have the evidence? Thank you. I have the alibi of my father. If your evidence holds water, you would have turned it over already. But why is the rumor been spreading around for years? I was a little boy back then. Nobody wanted to listen to me. You are the witness of your dad's alibi? Are you kidding me? All prisoners would say they are innocent. Didn't Yen tell you the same? Is this why you keep helping him? Old Yen took part in the robbery case. But he didn't kill anyone. He now repents his sin. Chan Ting-hsuan. Your boss fired a shot at your leg. Didn't you know that? For decades, you have been looking for Yen to seek revenge. You don't know right from wrong. I know what is right and wrong. I repay gratitude and seek revenge accordingly. If my boss told me a lie, I would believe it. Same as your father. If he tells a lie, you would still believe it. Do you know what you are talking about? I am different from you. How old were you back then? Isn't it easy to fool a kid? You found the alibi? Or your father told you so? Stop talking! It's the one thing I know best. Hang on. I guess you... haven't told Wang Chiang-wei that you are the son of the murderer. Right? Why didn't you tell her? You are sure that your dad was innocent, but you have no guts to tell her? Not that I have no guts. I just don't think it's necessary to tell her right now. Do you want me to tell her? How dare you? After all, Chiang-wei's parents' death was because of your father's mistake. Your dad started it. We had no choice, all right? Who knew her parents were returning? Your dad got the wrong info, and he ruined our plan. We had no choice. Chiang-ta. -Are you okay? -Don't touch me. Sorry. I didn't mean it. Are you... okay? I am fine. Do you know the guy earlier today? Chiang-ta. What did you say? Nothing. I've covered your wound. Don't let it get wet. Thank you. I know your action today was to protect me. Same as the incident at the rooftop. But I don't want my Big Cat to be injured. How old were you back then? Isn't it easy to fool a kid? Do you remember what time the case took place? We gathered at the main entrance around 4:30 p.m. That was the time when I was with dad. He was not the chief. It's already 6:30 p.m. You are the son of the murderer. You fell in love with the daughter of the victim. Is this your intention? You want to protect her, so that you can repent the sin of your father? In what position am I going to protect you? I feel tired. I'll take a rest now. I am home. You are here. Where's Chiang-ta? 4:30 P.M. CASE TOOK PLACE. WITH ALIBI. 4:30 P.M. CASE TOOK PLACE. Wang Chiang-ta fought with someone? He is not an agitated person. That's right. He doesn't want to tell me what was going on. Nor did he tell me who the person was. That must be a problematic person. Otherwise, Chiang-ta would not lose his mind to fight with him. But you should not worry. Wang Chiang-ta is great. He knows how to protect himself. He can even defeat Tieh Pu-fan, the strongest police officer. Don't worry. I've known Chiang-ta for years. He has a peculiar character and he is proud. Deep in his heart, he has a weak point. Because he is used to being alone. Are you going out? I need to go out for a walk. May I... Chiang-ta. Chiang-ta. I sat for General Scholastic Ability Test. I am now preparing for university interviews. Chiang-ta, are you not going to teach today? Old Yen is not in the tutorial class today. The students went for classes elsewhere. The atmosphere was weird. Can you eat slowly? Uncle Hsun. Did you suspect my dad 23 years ago? Of course, I trust him. That's right. I trust him too. It has been many years already. Even if it has been discovered, the truth is not necessarily what you hope for. What should you do, then? No way. There is only one truth. I promised my dad to find out the answer. Once the truth is discovered, the truth is the truth. I wish that you have the courage to face up to it. Fear not. Like father, like son. Chiang-ta is righteous, his father must be a good person. Your food. My food. I thought you want to starve me to death. Eat it. I am about to poison you. Poison... You won't do that. You would have taken action if you want me dead. You wouldn't waste your time poisoning my food. It is troublesome. It's delicious. I can eat it. Yum. You may leave after eating. Really? I may leave? Or you may stay here and let me stay in your house. You are injured. Chiang-ta hit me. Let me tell you. Chiang-ta has a friend who works as a prosecutor. Chiang-ta is a righteous person. You should not offend him. I offend him? He offends me instead. All right. You still don't know this. What is it? Chiang-ta's father was a police. The chief back then. What are you talking about? He... Are you sure? He hit me because of that. I see. No wonder Chiang-ta is interested in this case. His father was Chief. I see. It makes sense if we connect the dots. So this is the truth. But Chan, Chief was Chief. What the father did is irrelevant to the son. Chiang-ta was a kid back then. Chiang-ta is different from us. He is a math professor teaching at a university. You let go of him. He is in love with Wang Chiang-wei. He sees me as an enemy. He does not want to let me go. Chiang-wei. Oh, my! That's pathetic. He might want to repent the sin of his father. He wants me to shut up. To cover for his father's crime. It is still okay if he doesn't bother me. But he lost his mind today. I can't say for sure in the future. Chan. We made mistakes. Do not trouble the next generation, okay? You should tell him not to bother with me. I did some mistakes in the past. But now, I want to turn a new leaf. Turn a new leaf. You were just about to bomb my tutorial class. I saw in the news that you escaped and hurt a prison officer. He was severely injured. You want to turn a new leaf? Wang Chiang-ta won't believe it. Nor would I... Too impulsive... I can't control myself. I will change myself. I will change. No matter how much time I need. When I get to the bottom of the case, I will surrender myself... to accept the punishment. Not tasty? What are you doing here? Hey. Why am I here? You are home. I fell asleep while waiting for you. Chiang-wei said you are injured. What's going on? No big deal. Merely skin injury. You only lost your mind for that case. Don't tell me it is no big deal. There must be something. You once told me this. During your birthday each year, your dad bought you a toy car. You miss your dad. But look at your current lifestyle, you have been kidnapped by the case. Even your own girlfriend became the protagonist of the case. -You should help her-- -I'll protect Chiang-wei. I will find out the truth soon. I will have nothing to do with the case by then. You can't say for sure. Did you run into Chan Ting-hsuan in Jiannan Mountain? You may sleep on the floor. Don't be so mean. We'll share the bed. It has been a while. You... Are you alright? You suffer from a heavy injury. Chan Ting-hsuan is a wanted criminal. He is dangerous. When you run into him, you must inform the police. I almost arrested him today. I made a mistake and he fled again. You said again. You didn't meet Chan Ting-hsuan for the first time? The probability to run into Chan again is higher. When dealing with a wanted criminal, don't talk about probability. Wang Chiang-ta, I warn you. You are an ordinary citizen. You are not a policeman. Do not own the cop's duty. -Do not offend him. -I didn't offend him. Chan Ting-hsuan knows that I am related to the case. He knows. The situation is complicated now. Chan Ting-hsuan is as if a bomb to you. Wang Chiang-ta. Hey! Chiang-ta. Are you okay? I am fine. Regarding the incident yesterday, I'm not going to force you if you don't want to say anything. But you can still tell me when you feel like doing so. I will listen. Thank you. May I come in? We've received the response from the forensic center. A news for you two. Wang Chiang-ta was in Kuan Ching-ching's home. But he left no fingerprints. We checked phone records and surveillance records around Kuan's place. Wang Chiang-ta arrived in Kuan Ching-ching's home, then the police arrived a bit later. The gap was only three minutes. For one to commit the crime and staging within three minutes, the answer is... I hereby officially announce that Wang Chiang-ta is cleared of suspicions. Great. Thank you, Tieh. It's my job. I'm just doing what I need to do. One more question. Chiang-ta. Kuan Ching-ching left a quiz. Do you have any idea? I have checked the photo. The background is a municipal library. I found no other clues. This is the photo of the library. I am Tieh Pu-fan. Is everybody ready? Let me analyze it for you. Kuan Ching-ching designed the quiz for Wang Chiang-ta. She customized it for Wang Chiang-ta. It is most likely that Kuan wanted Chiang-ta to see her as the perfect girl. You need to put yourself in her shoes, so that you can guess what her message was. Am I right, Wang Chiang-ta? I once thought of this. But, I can't put myself in her shoes. Please explain. Because... Chiang-wei is my perfect girl. It is only her. I can't assume someone else as my perfect girl. Are you sure it is 100%? Not 200%? Or 300%? If the probability is more than 100%, then it is meaningless. When I say one, it is the only one. You are my only one. Are you two done yet? What are you doing? I wish you happiness. What's wrong with him? Fei is sick. Could Kuan Ching-ching mean that she wants me to look for clues from my perfect girl? Why didn't I think of that? It's strange that nobody is responding to my messaged. Tieh, are you expecting any phone call? Not really. I'm not expecting any phone call. -If not expecting... -Yeah. Have you heard from Si-te lately? Are you looking for her? I'm not looking for her. I am not... Why do I need to look for her? That's... She used to call me every day. She used to send me text messages to greet me "good morning" and "good night." She would also ask if I have eaten already. When we parted the other day, she didn't call me again. Nor did she text me. I just am thinking... if she has gone abroad? Since you are eager to know it, why not call her? Smart girl. I will, then. But I am a prosecutor. During office hours, I need to work. Personal relationship should be dealt with after work. Stop playing it cool. Call her. You see me wrongly. Right? I won't make any phone call. Hey. Solve the quiz quickly. That's how we look for the clues of the painting. Let me tell you. If the quiz is not resolved, we will never achieve a breakthrough. You're finally getting to the point. I knew this. So. You need to provide me all of your information. So that I can help you. Right! I need to show you something. -Chiang-wei, you stay here-- -I want to come with you. You better wait for us here. We'll be right back, all right? We'll be quick. Chiang-wei, wait for me. All right, let's go. Don't be so lovely. Wait for us. I brought Chiang-wei into the house, but we got trapped inside. Take a look. The firefighter's statement. It proved that the firefighters entered from the back door. Subsequently, I learned that my sister and brother-in-law... Ms. Kao was lying. What is her purpose? From what we see now, she wanted to protect Chiang-wei. Ms. Kao said that she wants to protect Chiang-wei at all costs. Even if you interrogate her, she still wouldn't say anything. Let me have a chat with Ms. Kao. I might be able to get some information. Well... It seems like the case is getting complicated. Why didn't you tell her? You are sure that your dad was innocent, but you have no guts to tell her? Do you want me to tell her? No way. I must deal with this matter immediately. I need to be quick. What are you murmuring about? Nothing. You are weird. Murmuring like an old man. Strange that she didn't send me a text message. She didn't call me as well. What are you murmuring now? Are you waiting for Si-te's call? I wait for her call? How is it possible? You better be serious. Have you heard of a saying? "Let someone off to catch him later." That's an old trick 20 years ago. I will never be trapped. Do you remember the girl from our school band? Her family was running a sushi shop. I know her. We visited the shop. They were selling a delicious miso soup. That's right. I used to call her every day. "Good morning," "good afternoon," and "good night." I would ask if she had already eaten or if she had already taken a shower. I kept calling her for three months. Until one day, I decided not to make any phone calls. And she couldn't withstand it. She called me within three days. Si-te just want to trap me with that trick. I won't possibly be trapped. All right? The loser is the one who makes the phone call. You'll lose if you're being serious. You talk a lot. You're still waiting for her phone call, after all. Why can't you say she's waiting for my phone call? You wait for her or she wait for you. I am the one who is not waiting. Waiting for someone you care for, I know the feeling. All right. You have a girlfriend and you are proud now. But I haven't found my girlfriend. Well, I don't know who my girlfriend will be. Miss. Here's your spaghetti. Miss. This is for you. I'm sorry. I'll help you throw it. Give it to me. Chiang-ta. I think that Hsiao Tieh is compatible with Ms. Si-te. Can we be their matchmaker? You find them to be compatible? Yes. They are tall and slim. Also, Ms. Si-te likes Hsiao Tieh. You are Hsiao Tieh's brother. You have to come up with an idea. But it is their matter. It is none of my business. Hey. How can you say that? Humans are social beings. We have to help each other. If you become more sociable, you'll be more charming. Why do I need to be more charming? As long as I can charm you. If I charm somebody else, the situation... would become complicated. I hope my friends wouldn't say that I am with a person who is hardly sociable. I am not sociable. And it troubles you. I hope that my friends will like you when I bring you to see them. Or just don't meet your friends, so that they can still like you. Hey, we are a couple. Your friends will talk about me in front or behind you. Hsiao Tieh is my only friend. He wouldn't say anything. Hsiao Tieh is your only friend, which is why you need to care for him more. Understand? Let me start it. Her cell phone has been turned off. How strange. Ms. Si-te doesn't usually turn off her cell phone. How about checking out at the tutorial class? Old Yen said he just wanted to look for teachers. He didn't return since yesterday. He didn't give me any tasks as well. Niu Niu. Old Yen used to monitor you. Don't you find it strange when he is absent for two days? I find it strange. Would he be okay? Niu Niu. Where is Ms. Si-te? Ms. Si-te applied for a leave. She called in sick? I don't know. Her family members called in and applied for a long leave. Applied for a long leave. The work is half done. OId Yen planned to do something outside and return shortly. His unfinished work is left on his desk. Could it be related to Chan Ting-hsuan? Chiang-ta, don't you find it strange? Ms. Si-te. Why would she apply for an unwarranted leave? It's not like her. Lien Chong-yen is Si-te's father. If he knows his daughter has gone missing, he should be more nervous than we do. He should have contacted us. Which he didn't. Si-te stays with her family. Lien Chong-yen must know something. When Si-te left, she was going to Hui Teng Company. We may look for Si-te's father and ask him. Old Yen. Boss. Are you two looking for me? Where have you been? What happened? Nothing. What happened to me? I am fine. Do you know where Ms. Si-te is? Where is Ms. Si-te? Ms. Si-te applied for one month leave. One month leave? Oh, my. Can you two please help me? I have a good idea now. Both of you must help me, all right? We'll talk next time. We're in a hurry. All right. We'll talk next time, okay? I'll wait for you. Miss, we are not peculiar people. We are Ms. Lien's colleagues. That's right. Colleagues from the tutorial class. I am sorry. You two can't go in without an appointment. Mr. Lien knows us. -We have an urgent matter. -Thank you. Thank you. Please ask your friends to vote for me. All right. Mr. Lien. We are Si-te's colleagues. We met during the auction. That's right. Please come in. Mr. Lien. We haven't heard from Ms. Si-te for several days. We worry a lot about her. I thought she is just mingling with her friends from the tutorial class? Why are you asking me? Well... You don't have her news? She rarely makes contact with the family. I don't want to restrict her. I thought Si-te stays with her family? Why did he say she rarely make contact with her family? Mr. Lien. Even if Si-te rarely make contact with her family, she is still missing. Don't you worry about her? Whether I worry or not, it is none of your business. In the past, when Si-te did not listen to me, she would ignore me. She has never gone against me. But since she met friends like you, she changed a lot. If there is nothing else, you may leave now. Bin. Mr. Lien. We're worried about her. Mr. Lien. I find Mr. Lien to be weird. Could he be hiding Ms. Si-te? I think so too. He seems to be trying to hide something from us. He must be playing a trick. What should we do now? Should we report to 113 Children and Women Protection Hotline? I have a better way. What is it? Hello, Hsiao Tieh. Chiang-ta, I think something's wrong. Please come over. Someone picked up a parcel. This thing is kept inside. A woman's blouse tainted with blood. Preliminary test shows that this garment is tainted with human blood. -That's it? -Yes. There's nothing special about this. Why do you ask me to rush over here? I don't know what Fei is talking about. Give it to me. Take a look. PU-FAN "Pu-fan." Is this nothing special? Are you not occupied lately? Did you contact your ex-girlfriend? What... I only keep in touch with Si-te. Stop your nonsense. You are looking for fun. You said Si-te is pretty. I didn't tell Chiang-wei. Hang on. That is Ms. Si-te's handbag. Chiang-wei, how can you tell that it is her handbag? Ms. Si-te and I like the handbags of that brand. We visited the shop one time. And she bought that handbag. That blouse also belongs to her. -Boss. -Fei. Where did the informant find this? Tell me quickly. The informant gave us the bag and left. -Which bureau? -I'll check now. Hsiao Tieh, hang on. Check all properties under Lien Chong-yen's name. Check within three kilometers of his properties. Find out if this spaghetti shop is nearby. Why are we going to check Mr. Lien's properties. We went to Lien Chong-yen's office. My preliminary judgment is that Si-te helps you investigate the case of the contaminated soy sauce. Her father kept her under house arrest. Would Lien Chong-yen create such a big mess? He still loves his daughter. He wouldn't keep her under house arrest intentionally. -Fei. -Boss. -Spare the phone call. We'll go now. -Yes, sir. -Let's go. -Hang on. Bring along this receipt. Ask them if they had a delivery address? All right. We've checked this building and we found nothing. Let's proceed to the next location. Exclude higher levels of the buildings. It's tough to throw something accurately from higher levels. Or it could go astray. Three apartments meet the conditions. The spaghetti shop did not keep the delivery address. This is the only building that meets the condition for delivery. We should go up now. The prosecutor is doing his job. Irrelevant people, please stay away. If you have a feedback or a complaint, you may have a cup of tea at our bureau. Open the door. Si-te. Hsiao Tieh. You received my message and came to my rescue. It is my job as a prosecutor to protect the safety of the people and their assets. Lien Si-te, listen to me. I will now announce... that Lien Si-te is under my protection. -Fall in love! -Fall in love! -Kiss her! -Kiss her! -French kiss! -French kiss! Si-te. To protect the safety-- -Ms. Si-te. -It is my job-- Chiang-wei! You saw my message and came to my rescue. Yes, I do. I got your message and recognized your handbag. We found you here, it is all thanks to Hsiao Tieh. He worried a lot about you. Really? The environment here is not bad. You have a bathtub. Thank you, Hsiao Tieh. This is my job. My pleasure. Blood flow from your finger. You were bleeding a lot. I hit the bodyguard outside the door and wrote with his blood. I see. Do you feel dizzy now? Not really. I am fine now. Well, Chiang-wei told me that you were anxious when you couldn't find me. I-- Si-te, why did your father keep you under house arrest? Well. We were at the car park and you mentioned about the goods department. I then went to the department to look for evidence. Mr. Hu caught me. And then he informed my dad. I guess my dad wants to protect me. So he kept me under house arrest. He shouldn't have done that. If Prosecutor Tieh arrests someone, he will be able to protect Ms. Si-te as well. Right? Why do you say so? -Boss. -Yes. We found falsified accounting records of the soy sauce factory and Hui Teng Company. But we found nothing before that. How did you find out? You discovered another case. The factory director Luo Ing-ping was involved in the assisted suicide case of Sun Hsiao-shan. -Sun Hsiao-shan? -Yes. She was my jade bracelet creditor. Sun Hsiao-shan? That's right. How weird. It is coincidental. Several unrelated individuals are now linked with each other. Investigation team found fingerprints in Sun hsiao-shan's home. Back then, I suspected that she did not commit suicide. But I found nobody for a crosscheck. Unexpectedly, when we investigated the factory, Sun Hsiao-shan was discovered. Luo Ing-ping was involved in the murder case. The factory's case is a piece of cake. And he admitted everything. Great. Fei, you know what? The first thing you need to do. I have no idea. Apply for a search warrant. All right, boss. I will get it now. Be quick. Boss. Search warrant for which area? As you please. Mr. Lien, would you comment? All right. Keep quiet. Let me repeat it. The company that I invested is managed by my friend. I didn't interfere in the management. My friend made profits unscrupulously. I felt bad about it. I will visit the district prosecutor's office tomorrow. I'll explain to the prosecutor. I will never comment on this matter anymore. Thank you. You always stay away when things go wrong. This is really unfair. Hey. Chan. Oh, my. I thought you were arrested. I didn't expect that you would dare to come over. I did not hide any wrong deeds in my heart. Heaven pities me. So that I have a chance to face up to Chiang-wei and apologize to her. I have let go of the great worry in my heart. I did not owe you anything. Why do I have to fear coming over? If you want to do something to me. You wouldn't have let me go. Right? You are different when you are the boss of the tutorial class. Your talks make sense now. Chan, listen to me. You were imprisoned for more than 20 years. What should be let go, you should let go. Yen. You think I am a cold-blooded person who doesn't regret? Who doesn't examine his own mistakes? I know that. I know that I destroyed a home. I destroyed my life and the lives of others. When I was in prison, I... I blamed everything. I hated everything. Subsequently, I found out... what I really hated was my angry self back then. Chan. I didn't expect you to repent. I have an idea now. I need your help now. You need my help? Well... I will send you off here. I will pick you up when you are done. Are you busy? Nothing special. I need to sit down and think about Kuan Ching-ching's quiz. Hey. It's Kuan Ching-ching again. I don't want you to think about her. I am not thinking about her, just her quiz. Kuan's selfie photo is the clue. You'll think of her when you see her photo. I have no choice. Kuan Ching-ching stole the painting. It had a key secret in it. I must resolve the quiz. What secret is kept in the painting? Can't you let Hsiao Tieh investigate? Do you need to lose your appetite and sleep over it? The painting was stolen from the fire accident 23 years ago. It's the closest to the truth. That is the key to disclose the myth of Chief. This is the only opportunity. Chiang-wei, I promise you. After some time, when the truth is disclosed, I will tell you. -Really? -Yes. All right. However, I have a quiz for you, too. You have a quiz? Yeah. Sure. My gesture is messy. He can never guess it. I have an idea now. Watch out. I am not done yet. But you are... How could you do that? You can even guess Kuan Ching-ching's quiz... This is a foul play. Wang. This is my answer. I got it, right? I don't know. You go home and wait for your report card. I am unbridled today. I feel the young today. We have to treasure this day. I will treasure every single day. I won't let yesterdays affect the our tomorrow. Oh, yeah. Don't leave after this. Do me a favor. Well... Do you want me to pick the moon or shoot down the sun for you? My Big Cat has changed. He is talking about something that is impossible. Is it weird? Yes. I watched some movies and they said that, too. That's how they acted. It is unlike what Wang Chiang-ta usually talks about. Yes. It's kind of weird. In this world, I have... three favorite things. What are those? The sun. The moon. The Big Cat. The sun brings us the day. The moon gives us the night. The Big Cat... represents forever. This is spectacular. You are a good history teacher who is good at talking about love. Yes. Ms. Chiang-wei will now teach Mr. Chiang-ta. The first step in love is to always accompany your girlfriend. -All right. -Follow me. Hello! Good evening to our audience. Sophie applied for a leave today. And Dorothy came over as a replacement. The theme that we are about to discuss is about soulmates. May I ask our audience? Is your better half your soulmate at the same time? If your partner is not your soulmate. Your soulmate is someone else. Can you accept it? We'll open the phone line. Dachi Takeshi Kaneshiro. Hello. Hello, Dorothy. -Hi. -I have a girlfriend. And I have a close female friend. Oh, really? Can you accept it? If your girlfriend has a soulmate? Of course not. Men are able to separate between soul and physique. But women can't do that. There is no such thing. You are cheating. This is all about gene. You just can't deny it. Dachi Takeshi Kaneshiro. I don't think it is related to the gene. It is gender discrimination. Let me tell you. Humans are educated. We are civilized beings. -We are more-- -Women are not rational. This is a gene problem. You are emotional. Who would want to discuss with you? Dachi Takeshi Kaneshiro is offline now. Let's talk to the next caller. Sherlock. Good evening, Sherlock. It has been some while. I support Dorothy. Thanks for your support. I would like to remind Dachi Takeshi Kaneshiro. If a gene is the answer to all questions, the world will have few complicated problems. Yes. Speaking of which, you left a question on my fan page. Have you found the answer? I have found it. Also, the answer is in front of my eyes. Unexpectedly, both Sherlocks are Wang Chiang-ta. He's good at keeping secrets. He still can't help but solve Kuan Ching-ching's riddle. Both of them are as if soulmates. Who is it? The painting that Kuan Ching-ching stole from you, I know where it is. What kind of trick are you playing? I know the secret that's hidden in your room.
