 You broke the jade bracelet. You must take responsibility. The bracelet getting broken was a probability issue. Why should I be responsible? I didn't expect that you were a tutorial teacher. If a lady stretches out her hand, a gentleman should also do the same. A man with real ability has a personality like that. It's called pride. What about Black Devil? The man we arrested does not know about Black Devil. There's no clue available.

 -The food addict met the dark queen. -Who's dark queen? Wang Chiang-ta! You are a man! You must take responsibility! Don't be arrogant! You know I can sue you if you humiliate me in public. I didn't humiliate you. You are not the only one named Wang Chiang-ta in this world. Besides, there's no one else here. How am I humiliating you in public? You want to use the law? I can also sue you for owing money and not paying it back. For the jade bracelet. I really can't be bothered to deal with you.

 I have already told you that I have nothing to do with that. Hey! Why do you always have to be arrogant and self-righteous? Uncaring and unsympathetic. It's natural for a math teacher to be good at math, but you don't have to be so arrogant! They compliment you and call you lion king. To me, you are just a cat, a big, bluffing cat. If people call me by a certain name, that's their business. I've never called myself a lion. Look at yourself. You act gentle in public, but you say bad things behind someone's back. Is that what a teacher should be like? I went to a place where there are no people to express my feelings. Is that talking behind someone's back? A place with no people? Am I not a person? Well, you tell me. Taipei is such a big city, and yet I meet you here. Are you following me? Can you tell me the probability of that, Mr. Math Teacher? Mr. Math Teacher? Mathematics is the law of the universe. It's the core of every science. You want to talk about math with me, huh? I never thought math can be used to fight. History is the core of civilization. Wow, there's even history, too? Who are you? I am a sound designer. I'm here to collect the sound of birds tonight. You guys are boring. You are arguing about nothing. Usually, people argue because of someone cheating or someone moving on. But you guys are talking about nothing. I‘ll have to erase that recording. You guys are the most boring couple in this world. -We are not a couple. -We are not a couple. What a bummer. I'm leaving now. Wang Chiang-ta, wait for me! I don't wait for anyone. You're not a gentleman! Daddy, you give me a toy car every year. Can I have something different? I came here quickly to pick you up right after my shift. Isn't that enough of a surprise? Hey, sir! He has a gun. Chiang-ta, let me check it. Let's cut your birthday cake later. Daddy, it's my birthday! You must come back and enjoy the cake! Chiang-ta, breakfast time! What's wrong? Nightmare again? Nothing. Nothing? Your face is telling me that something happened. How's the investigation about Black Devil going? There hasn't been any information since he escaped last time. Useless. Well, it seems like you are my boss. What's your business with my job performance? Let me tell you, investigations should not be disclosed. You should thank me for being a talented prosecutor classmate. Otherwise, you have no chance to investigate. Don't be mean. Hey, Chiang-ta. Actually, that case happened more than 20 years ago. Only luck can help us find any new clues. I just want to know the truth. Lock throat! It hurts! It hurts! You're really... Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed? Wang Chiang-ta, let me tell you. There are some things you cannot force. Just think about how many unsolved cases there are from the past. Oh, you. Don't push yourself too much, okay? If you keep being like this, you'll soon need to see a psychiatrist. -Prosecutor Tieh Pu-fan. -What? You don't need to worry about my physical and mental health. Just worry about this case. You always win at judo. But why don't you teach me? I care so much about your life. Why don't you teach me something, right? No matter what, we are close friends. Right? Very good. Sleep. No, I need to make breakfast. Hey, Wang Chiang-ta! Your task is to maintain order. Cutting line is prohibited. If you see some parents getting annoyed due to the long wait, you must offer them water, drinks, and snacks. By the way, you need to smile. Come on, let me see your smile. Any question? -No! -No! Good. Niu Niu. You shall hold your position in the registration area. Of course, I know. Good. Okay, we are ready. Let them in! Wait a moment. Calm down! You guys must wait in line! One at a time! Parents, over here. Excuse me, please let me explain it. These seats are closest to Teacher Wang Chiang-ta when he gives lessons. VIP Rock Area. You see, the price is a little more expensive. But it's definitely worth it. Think about it. Your kid will sit here, learning Wang Chiang-ta's lectures at this close distance. They will be in the forefront, right? -Yes. -Yes. -Absolutely shock the world, right? -Right. All right, who wants to have this spot? -Me! -Me! Everyone, getting into the top universities isn't just a dream, right? -Yes! -Yes! -Who wants this? -Me! I want to sit there. This seat is also not that bad. -By that television, who wants this? -Wang Chiang-ta! Who wants this? -Mr. Hsun. -Chiang-ta. This is crazy. Really crazy. Do they think they are buying the concert tickets of Jay Chou? I think this lion is not bad. I think it's has something to do with Old Yen's partiality. If he promotes any of the rest of us in the same way, our student count would explode, right? I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about myself. This traditional lady. If you insist that he's a lion, then I will be a fierce tiger. I really don't want to say this. But, actually, the number of students in my holiday class has already... exploded. Mr. Hypocritical Former Top Teacher, let me also tell you. Not just my holiday class, but my regular classes are full. I just didn't open more classes because I'm too tired. I believe you. I think you guys are both very awesome. What about my class? Maybe it's this. Senior One. HISTORY, GEOGRAPHY, SOCIETY CLASS LIST Ten. Senior Three is good. Twelve students. Come on. NT$ 2,700 per hour, NT$ 500 per student. Minus the students from Wang Chiang-ta's class. I'll eat dirt this month. I don't think you can even afford dirt. -Mr. Hsun. -Thanks. You're welcome. I know you are famous, but it's still amazing to see it with my own eyes. It's rather conspicuous at the tutorial class. It's annoying. An able man is always busy. Moreover, with reputation comes reward. Mr. Hsun, I've already arranged for Hsiao Ching to be in my class. You didn't have to come here. It's okay. It's my pleasure to see Teacher Wang Chiang-ta. And be proud on behalf of your parents. Would they really need this kind of pride? You need to let go of the knot in your heart. Listen to me. Don't investigate anymore. I know that it has been a long time. But the things that happened at that time are still clear in my mind. It's very clear. Sometimes, at night, it comes to find me in my dreams. When you get old as me, you wouldn't be complaining about having good memory. Chiang-ta, don't torment yourself. Live your life. There are things that will cause greater pain when you pull them out. I'm sure your dad doesn't want this either. But a wound that hasn't healed will continue to hurt. I can't help it. You are as stubborn as your dad. It's not good. Today, we'll discuss about the Shanrang system. What is Shanrang system? This is when the emperor passes his throne on to someone of a different last name. So, when did it start? Class, I know the history about it is a bit complicated, but don't sleep, okay? I'm doing my best here. Or let me tell you guys a joke. One day, a loach ran into a crab. The crab got so annoyed and said, "Hey, are you blind?" The loach then said, "I'm a loach, not a shrimp.“ Not funny? Why are you guys not laughing? I thought of that for a long time. Let's back to our lesson. Chiang-wei. Teacher Chiang-wei. Why did you run off so quickly faster after class? Boss. You know, for each lesson, we ask the students to fill up the survey, right? Yes. Let me read out your survey responses. First, "So boring." Second, "What a boring teacher." "The lesson of this teacher is super boring." Chiang-wei, I know you are a new teacher. But if you can't attract these basic students, then there's no need to try out for two months. I‘d like to say goodbye to you next week. Boss, although I'm a newbie in the tutorial industry, I'm willing to learn. Please give me one more chance. Right. Learn. That's the important point. So when you don't have lessons, sit in on other teachers' classes and learn how they teach. Like Teacher Si-te for English, Teacher Jen-i for Math, and also Wang Chiang-ta. -Wang Chiang-ta? -Yes. He's also a newbie. Yes, he's a newbie. But he has his own style, not like you. You must learn from him and improve your skills after that. And this is an order. No negotiations. Teacher Wang. Fighting. Fighting. Hey, mister. Are you blind? Aren't you going to apologize? You look so suspicious. CHIANG-TA MATH Why is it you again? Wang Chiang-ta. A big, bluffing cat. An arrogant nuisance. The merchant in Shakespeare’s writing. That's you. The big cat, Shylock. Chiang-wei, welcome. For new arrivals? Yes. I want to come by to check if I can find the bag that my mom used to like. You mean that classic one from 20 years ago? It might come out. But it's impossible to find the exact same one. But I want to see if I'm lucky enough. All right, help yourself. -Let me know if you need anything. -Okay. The products of this brand have become your source of healing. You come to look for bags and check out new arrivals. When you're feeling down, you come to take a look, too. I was influenced by my mother. This is her favorite brand. My mom's taste is so special. Missing your mom? Why are you so gloomy? It's like there are dark clouds spreading. I'm thinking if I've been possessed by some unlucky ghost. You are unlucky every day. Come on, I'm terribly unlucky lately! That cheapskate Shylock, he did not pay me back. Now I have to go to the same tutorial school with him, and I'm being compared to him. Please, I graduated from a teacher's school, right? But today, I was told that the way I teach is boring. Who was the one who said we should greet each day with a smile? MARTIAL CLUB Thanks. -It's a draw. -How childish. Hey. Wang Chiang-ta, you hadn't been practicing. Why are you still so strong like that? Because I‘m naturally strong. Oh, well. Okay. You were the strongest in judo back in high school. Hey, why didn't you go to the finals, though? Perhaps you are not a teacher now but a national athlete. Why waste your energy in a game you can never win? If your life is based on probabilities like that, isn't that so boring, huh? Hey! You are so unfriendly! That was fun. Also... Okay. I won't buy you a late-night snack today. I'll enjoy it myself. Are you okay? I'm okay. Thanks. -How about your feet? -It's okay. Thief, don't move! You stole my bag. Give it back to me! -Leave me alone! -Hey! Wait! Might there be a misunderstanding between you two? A misunderstanding? -Miss, you... -Hsiao Tieh. -My things are in there. -Are you sure it's your bag? I'm definitely sure. Check it directly. -My things are inside. -Hsiao Tieh. -You want to leave now? -Check it now. -My key, wallet, -These two girls -and my lip cream are in there. -quarreling due to this bag. -Do you need to... -Why do I have to open my bag for you? -I don't want-- -She's not a thief. It's a misunderstanding. This bag is too long for you based on your height. This bag is belonged to this lady. Moreover, when I was at the front desk, I saw another lady with the same bag. Your friend probably took your bag. Can we leave now? Your bag is here. When you were in changing room, you didn't know that your friend took your bag. So, you put your wallet inside the bag of this lady. -Idiot-- -Things are cleared up. Maybe you should say sorry to this lady. -It's okay. -Sorry, miss. -Are you injured? -No, it's okay. -Why you didn't tell me? Embarrassing! Go. -What's going on? Thanks for your help, Teacher Wang. My friend is strange. Ignore him. -What a coincidence. -Hsiao Tieh, I'm leaving now. Okay. See you next time. Bye, friend of Wang Chiang-ta. My response is so simple. Just no. Teacher Wang Chiang-ta, don't be like that. Actually, you can treat her as if she were air. One more person in the classroom means one more person is breathing. Carbon dioxide increases and oxygen decreases. Therefore, the effect will be double. You still think there's no effect? Or you want to see the arithmetic formula about it? Teacher Chiang-ta, didn't you ask me to find a teacher's aide? I haven't been able to find anyone. Just three days. Treat her as a teacher's aide for three days. She's not an additional person. You can keep breathing. All right? All right. In a tutorial class, your role is not only a good teacher but also a good actor. You need to show off your charms so that you can attract the students. You are a brand and you need to sell yourself. Find out your character then develop it. Take Lien Si-te for example. Graduated from NCCU, Foreign Languages, with a master's in Comparative Literature from NYU. Miss International, the most popular in the university. The go-to choice for a government interpreter. Her nickname is Queen Lien because she has attractive eyes. The difference between the present perfect tense and past perfect tense is that first one regards something in the past into the present and future, but the latter regards something in the past. Example. -Understand? -This teacher is so beautiful. But, boss, I realized that a lot of boys are not really paying attention. They are just looking at her body. Boss. This is called the Charmed Hypnosis method. Admiration of beauty is natural to humans. As you admire her beauty, the knowledge of what she taught can get into you. But I don't have a body like her. Really? It's okay. We have another style. Tseng Jen-i. Graduated from NCTU, Applied Mathematics. He has participated in dating and talent shows. Now, he also manages a live-streaming auction website. His nickname is Guaranteed Replacement Apathetic, The Best Zeng. This chalk is just a normal chalk if it's in the hands of you guys. But in my hands, it will be... two pieces of chalks. Thank you. A student made a bet with me before. If he places in the top 3 in the monthly test, I have to sing a song for everyone. Naturally, I would lose. Why? Because the students I teach only place... first. Not surprisingly, his score report is here. Let us know his ranking. Read it out loud. He placed third. Thank you. It's that easy. I am a man who does what he says. Therefore, I will share with you here my gorgeous voice and sing a song for everybody. Boss, I think the style of Teacher Tseng is perhaps a little too special. I'm afraid that I can't use it. Okay. Well, it's not your fault. Now, let's visit our current greatest one, Lion Pride. Let's go. I... Boss, I got an inspiration. I think there's no need to visit him-- Wang Chiang-wei. All right. Teacher Wang. You guys are not students so don't take up the seats. All right. Here. Please. This is a simple arithmetic formula. Trash times trash equals trash squared, right? No. When a trash meets another trash, rather than multiplying, they will attract an infinite amount of trash. I hope there's no trash among you. -Is that me? -Is that me? Mathematics is the core of all the sciences. The rest is mere ostentation. Let's begin. Turn to page 15. Let's solve the problem. He's crazy. Everybody, let's review the three methods to solve this problem. The first one is known as the dumb method. You must guess the unknown value to solve it. If you're persistent enough and you have plenty of time, you can use it. The second one is the Newton interpolation method. It's our major solution. We also need to guess the unknown value, but the following calculations are easier. The third one is Lagrange method. The key to the Lagrange method is the y variable. The question is if you can remember this formula when taking your exam. If you can, the following calculations are relatively simple. Okay, we're done with this problem. Teacher Wang. There's a more convenient method. Do you know it? How am I supposed to know Everybody, if you guys want to major in history like Teacher Wang, then you don't have to pay particular attention to the following method. But if you'd like to get better results in college entrance examinations, you guys need to take some notes. Screw you. What a big Shylock cat. First, you talked about trash, and now you're making a fool out of me. It's time to declare war, isn't it? And there's the answer. Well, Teacher Wang. Please print copies of the other teaching materials. We will use them later. Why me? Yes, sir. No problem at all. I'll print them. Who knew that Teacher Wang is so mean? I think that female teacher is so weak. The aura of Teacher Wang is just too strong. Correct. Fan An is coming. He is like the nutrition of my soul. Hi, I'm Fan An. Hey, she said you are so handsome. I didn't. Don't say that. -Don say that. I didn't-- -Excuse me, but please don't move your head so much during class. I sit behind you, so you block my view. Okay? Don't move so much. You block his view. "If you guys want to be like Teacher Wang, then the second method is unnecessary." Being good at math is not a big deal. This is public humiliation, Wang Chiang-ta. ADD PAPERS IN THE PAPER TRAY Z is equal to... Lin Chian-yu. What's the solution? Should I go over there? Come here. Hsiao Ching. Did you know that your dad came here very early and waited in line just to register you into this class? Why are you always lying down during class? Mr. Chiang-ta, I know that it was you who got me in. Regardless, you must pay attention in class. But I've been listening the whole day. I'm so exhausted. Besides, I know all of these solutions. You know all of it? So, why are you here? Actually, my dad asked me to come here. That's why. Spending the hard-earned money of your parents, but not studying hard. How is that something that won't make your dad upset? Madam, it's none of your business. "Madam"? I'm as old as Wang Chiang-ta. You call him mister but call me madam? Mr. Chiang-ta, I'm happy to be in your class. I feel more motivated to learn. I'll do my best not to sleep during your class. Hsiao Ching. Not only my class, you must pay attention to all of your classes. -Got it. -Hsiao Ching, hurry. I'm leaving. Chin, wait for me. Since she's the daughter of your friend, you must correct her attitude. You mean about calling you "madam"? Teacher Wang, are you acting or are you really dumb? Let me tell you. If you play a role for a long time, it will become true. I think you have a lot of free time. Mind your own business. I have endless energy for students. How admirable. If so, please take these examination papers and score them. Miss Endless Energy Teacher Wang. -All of them? -All of them. I'm teach history. I'm not that good at math. Not good at it? Can you handle a little bit of English? A, B, C, D. It's just multiple choice. Just four letters, very easy. Teacher Wang, finish grading them and put them on my desk tomorrow. Thanks for your endless energy, Teacher Wang. Not only weak, but also foolish. What's the big deal about knowing some Arabic numerals? Wang Chiang-ta. What does this mean? RESIGNATION You think a resignation letter can cut off our relationship forever? Director, I really have to fulfill a silly promise. And I don't want to delay the school schedule. That's why I have to quit. I know that's just an excuse. The main reason is that anonymous letter. Right We are already dealing with this issue. Don't be like that. Dealing with it? Director. I just got this report ten minutes ago. "In 1994, a horrible robbery-homicide case happened in Ming Guang Road. The suspect, Officer Wang Yu-ming, died at the site." Honestly, the excellent professor title means nothing to me. I don't care about it at all. You brought me in in order to gain more funds. But now, these kinds of attacks are coming my way. And you said that the school is still "dealing with this issue"? It's obvious that there is someone behind it. Why do you worry about it so much? It's unnecessary to check my family background due to a workplace conflict. It was my own decision to resign. I won't approve your resignation. Just take a leave of absence for this school term. This research room is still yours. You can use it however you like. You can come back next school term. The deceased, Wang Yu-ming, hid from his wife that he had lost a NT$ 600,000 investment. Is it possible that he did this out of desperation? It is said that he took a doll of Wang's daughter. Does this mean that he had entered the crime scene? My daddy is not a murderer! My daddy is not a murderer! Little kid, -what is it? -Everything's under investigation. He picked up me that time -to celebrate my birthday with me! -Please wait and see. I told him that someone was there. He's the son of Yu-ming. I'll take him home. My daddy wasn't corrupt! That evil Wang Chiang-ta. Doesn't he know that staying up all night to score test papers is bad for the liver? Teacher, let me help you. -Thank you. -My pleasure. You know, yesterday, I didn't get enough sleep. I was just so distracted. Why are you here? Why didn't you contact me? I was just passing by. I'm leaving now. Wait. Where are you going to run in this current situation? You have nowhere to go. Why don't you surrender yourself Surrender Don't be silly. Give me your phone. What do you want to do? Give me your phone. What That's my phone number. Dad! You must call me. At least let me know where you are. Call me! Morning, Chiang-wei. Morning. What's the matter? God. My students who stay up all night playing LOL are just like you now. What happened? I stayed up all night to help Wang Chiang-ta score the test papers. Until 7:00 a.m. this morning. Wow, what a rude newcomer. He just let you score test papers in this way? Aren't you a History teacher? Can you understand 1, 2, 3, 4? Of course, I can. Most of them were multiple choice. There were only two calculations. There were even calculation problems? So miserable. This Wang Chiang-ta is not kind at all. You said he's like a gorgeous... Stop it. Lion. Recently, I realized that he's really arrogant. Last Friday, invited him out for a late-night snack. And I waited for him near the elevator door. Teacher Wang. Thanks for your help at the gym last time. Are you free later today? I want to invite you out to eat. That's not necessary. Hey, wait a moment! Let's go downstairs together. Please hurry. The show is about to start. What? What show? Please, I am in a hurry. Okay. He's so mean, right? He's really rude. He completely ignored me. Actually, I really don't get Old Yen's ideas. We are a tutorial school, not Disneyland. He named him "Lion Pride"? That's it. Why not "Jiang Ziya-licorn" or "Zhuge Liang-oblin"? Chiang-wei, you are really a history teacher. Even your jokes are about historical stories. Although it's not really funny. Let's stop talking about him. Teacher Si-te, you still got me. There's a ancient arithmetic formula. If I am 9, then you are 3. Because it's still all about you even after I'm divided by you. Let go. It's really awkward, Mr. Former Top Teacher. Chiang-wei, please come here. Chiang-wei. Yesterday, a friend of mine specially brought me this painting back from Zhejiang Province. I want you to help me identify it. Boss, I need to prepare for my class later. And I'm so tired today. Can I help you tomorrow? No, come on. Look at it, okay? This... Where did you get this paperweight? This paperweight... I have no idea. It's cheap. I just bought it in a stationery shop. This is made from ancient brass. How could you get it in a stationery shop? You are so weird. I need you to identify the painting. Why are you identifying the paperweight? Tell me. Where did you get this? Or who sold this to you? I don't know. Forget it. You can prepare for your class now. Go. Teacher Wang, you are just in time. I got something to tell you. Teacher Wang, you can prepare for your class. Teacher Wang, Chiang-wei. Go and prepare for your class. You are just in time. This Teacher Wang is so weird today. So weird. Old Yen, the problem posted on the Internet before was solved by a student. Do you have some information about the student? Why is everybody asking me question today? One after another. I... Boss Yen. I don't know. I just posted an announcement with the requirements. I can offer a NT$10,000 scholarship as a reward for solving the problem. And then, it was actually solved by someone. But that person just uploaded the video. I don't know who that is. And they didn't come to claim the money. Didn't come to claim the money? So what you want is not the money. What do you want then? Of course, I want money. A painting of my dad and his paperweight. Why does Old Yen have so many things of my dad? Little Wei, how is my handwriting? It looks like a painting. Of course, my handwriting is very precious. So many people want to obtain it. Little Wei, be careful! This is a brass paperweight from the Ming Dynasty. But you have two of them. What a pity. It's Chang-tai Tutorial Classes, hello. When did you get this call? Of course, I know. Okay, thanks. Hey, Niu Niu. Please print 30 copies of the marked items. I will use for the Chinese lesson. Director. Director, something happened. I got so many calls saying that World Tutorial Class is poaching students with their low tuition fee. What? It's... A cutthroat competition. What animosity does Li Ta-shih have towards me? Yes, they poached our teacher last time. Now, they target the students. He's going too far! Force a good man to be a evil. Boss, you are a Chinese language teacher. Do not use idioms inappropriately. There's a problem. The student list is classified. How could Li Ta-shih get it? Could he get it from the schools? Impossible. Schools have strict management on it. Impossible! Or the list is not stored well? There's a traitor... in my school. MURDER OF ANTIQUE DEALER, CRUEL GANGSTER CHAN TING-HSUAN BLACK DEVIL POLICE OFFICER WANG IS A SUSPECT Boss, so you think this case is related to Black Devil? Little friend, can't you read? Prosecutor, so, your conclusion is... Can't you understand these question marks? I... I... I think you've already heard. There's a traitor in our tutorial school, who sold our student list to Li Ta-shih. Let's see. There are a total of 12 cameras in our school. There's one for the elevator. Three for corridors. One for the front desk. One for each of the three small classrooms. Two for the large classrooms. One for lobby hall, one for the door outside. The only possible crime scene is... here. There's a public computer next to the printer. Also, there are two computers in the lobby hall. The areas are linked together. I don't understand what you're talking about. The student list is stored in the internal network. After signing in with the password, you can walk out with all the data on a USB flash drive. Being good at math is also being good at logical inference. Understand? Public computer is the only way for the traitor to enter the internal network. Therefore, these are the three most likely possibilities. But, boss, how sure are you that the list was copied into a USB flash drive and not written on paper or photographed using a phone camera? How can I be sure? I have a spy in World Tutorial Class! It's none of your business. I need you to look at the surveillance footage. I already know. All of you... are suspects! What? You guys have the password of the internal network. In addition, the traitor must have some kind of conflict with me. Someone who clashes with me. I have thought about it. But it's so unfortunate. Recently, each one of you guys has quarreled with me. Boss, how can you suspect your teachers? Chiang-wei, he is always suspicious of others. You‘ll get used to it. Moreover, in his eyes, everyone is like him. Like everyone is stingy like him, and everyone has a problem with him. Two days ago, I merely ate the doughnut he bought after waiting in line. He almost cut off ties with me. Really? In addition, if you go shopping with him, he will not bring any money. When you get back to the school and ask him for the payment, he will be annoyed. So, you're all confessing now, huh? You guys have very strong motives. Who would commit a crime over a doughnut? So, you mean, because I lent you money, I have a motive to commit a crime? That means you remember that I lent you money, right? -Well, pay me back. -Wait, what? -Pay me back. -We aren't talking about that now. It's not the time to talk about that. Sit down! What are you laughing about, Chiang-wei? You also have a motive. I... You are a new teacher. Perhaps you were the traitor sent by Li Ta-shih to steal my student list. If you say that, then this big Shylock cat... No, I mean, Wang Chiang-ta also has a motive. Oh, I see. Teacher Wang, you are a sought-after talent in the tutorial industry. You are so popular. Why did you choose me? So weird. If I am a popular talent, I would just go to a different school. Why should I steal your list? Your logic is weird. I think there's someone here who's not only poor at math but also poor in common sense. He's cursing. -He's cursing you. -I... You are poor at math and even poor at basic logic. -I'll go to class. I’m leaving now. -Hey. -I'm going to class, too. -You... My time is almost up. Hey! You guys... You'd better... You'd better have many classes like that. Where's the classroom of Teacher Wang Chiang-ta? He's in Class B today. Near the corridor over there. Thanks> Well, you are so cute. Okay, everyone, in this unit, 6th and 8th problems in page 53 are the key points. -So as 9th and 10th. -His class is really different. There are so many students here. Wang Chiang-wei? Do you remember me? Okay, everyone, we're done here for today. Remember that we have a quiz next time. How could I meet her in here? It must be God's will. Not bad. So, you are a tutorial teacher. Last time, you didn't write that down in your information. It's a long story. I'd like to sacrifice my time to listen to your story. Your time is valuable. I don't want to waste it. Well, please give me your contact information. I'll help you monitor Wang Chiang-ta. Force him to take responsibility. Okay. Yes. Sorry. Thanks for your help. My pleasure. Your IQ falls to that of a three-year-old when you meet a woman. I have met my goddess. Even if my IQ will be decreased to that of a three-year-old, I'll be okay. Well, please help me calculate the probability of meeting Wang Chiang-wei in a big crowd. How small? I met her, too. Tell me. How small? But I got her phone number. Do you have it? You don't have it! Watch out. Do you know about the issue of the student list bring stolen? Really? Who did it? Little Chian, you're really something. Always the first one to hear about news. I'm the only one who has it. Do you have it? Today is Friday. Do you guys have any plans? Are you free, Teacher Si-te? -No, I'll go to KTV later. -KTV? Please take me with you. I'm a good singer. Do, Re, Mi Okay, next year. What about you, Wei? I'm also not free. You can date Teacher Guo. Who's Teacher Guo? Teacher Guo... I'm not free, too. You have no qualifications to turn me down. -Weird. I'm leaving. -Hey, all of you, don't go. You guys must stay here to cooperate with the investigation of the traitor. You can ask the police to do it. I already called the police. But it'll be a long time if we just let them do it. I must rely on myself. You guys must stay here. If you go, you are the traitor. You want to escape, huh? How long will this take? Can you come forward to help them? I think this minor problem will be solved very quickly. I think this is a boring and ridiculous ordeal. I don't want to care. Well, I guess it's showtime for me. Everybody, attention, please. I am Prosecutor Tieh Pu-fan. It's police investigation now. Men to the left, women to the right. And you, with the crutches, against the wall, please. -I called the police-- -Do it! -I-- -Do it! He's at it again. The friend of Wang Chiang-ta is a prosecutor. That's why he has a sense of justice. According to the monitor, there are so many people who used that computer. Nonsense. Teacher Tseng and Lien, you guys told me that you guys just printed the test papers? Yes. The time spent on the computer was not too long. Teacher Lien spent about 1.5 minutes. But Teacher Tseng spent only 35 seconds. I've checked the size of this file. If you want to save it on a USB flash drive, it might take 3 to 5 minutes. Therefore, you guys are not the traitor. Thanks, I'm clocking out. -Your salary will be deducted if you go. -Thanks. You helped me again. I got it. Please make it quick. I‘m in a hurry, too. Okay. You are next, Wang Chiang-ta and Miss Chiang-wei. You guys said that you did not use that computer. According to the footage, it's true that neither of you touched it. That makes the both you innocent. Well, and that... Teacher Guo. Well, I just asked that hairless Teacher Guo. He said his laptop was connected to a printer. So, the probability of using a computer is zero. It's not him. But who is it then? Oh, Niu Niu. How could it be Niu Niu? Old Yen, don't just guess it. Okay, don't guess it. Yes, don't make guesses. The working students or the students... There are so many people. How are we going to figure this out? How? Help me. Hey, Teacher Wang. -Where are you going? We're in a meeting. -Leaving. Teacher Wang, we are in a meeting! What's going on? What happened? Why did he just leave once he heard that beep Does he have an alarm phobia? No, once he hears the beep, he just needs to go to the toilet. He can come back after that. Hey, wait! Wang Chiang-wei, Teacher Wang, come here. They were too fast. You're the only one left. You must stay and help me investigate. Oh, I'm a teacher, not a detective! I'll have to say no. Don't say no for me, all right? You're the only one who can help me. This USB flash drive has... all the files of that monitor. It's too large. I can't watch it all. Help me check if there's anyone suspicious. -Help me, come on-- -Boss! I just helped Wang Chiang-ta score test papers till this morning. It's not my job. You can't exploit me like that. I don't force labor. I'll give you overtime pay, all right? -Really? -Of course. All right. In accordance with the student worker's pay. -Hey! -Come on, please! Friday, the pre-weekend of office workers. Coupled with the upcoming long holiday, the probability of her coming here increases by 10%. But... there are no single customers today. Also, none of the laughter sounds like hers. Welcome home. What? Didn't meet your dark queen? Your face is telling me that something happened. I'm not a math teacher, but I know the chance of meeting dark queen today is... Moreover, you were drunk that day. The chance of recognizing her clearly might only be 5%. Tieh Pu-fan. There's a theory that closing your mouth is healthier. Do you know that? Why? Or you'll get beaten up. Hey. Have you ever thought if that dark queen is really ugly? Or what if she's so fat? Or... with bad breath? Or she's also a food addict like you and she farts a lot? Or what if she's a man? "Class ten, grade three, handmade potato chips. Yummy! Wang Chiang-ta, I love you. We are in love." Tieh Pu-fan, you're so noisy. My name's Tieh Pu-fan. So I'm not absolutely noisy. Hey, I got it. It must be a dream of yours. Have you ever heard of a song called "Just a Dream"? Wang Chiang-ta, you are really... Hey! I've been playing that for three days! I just got there! And then you just turned it off! I haven't even saved it. I’ve been trying to jump again and again! I'll do it again. Why did I not leave faster? Why did I walk slowly? How can I finish all this? Old Yen really treats me like a part-time staff. Can it be the same person? TIEH PU-FAN: I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU BEFORE SLEEPING. GOOD NIGHT. WANG CHIANG-WEI: I'M BEING FOLLOWED. Chiang-wei responded. This lady is in crisis and needs someone to help her out. She gave me a signal. Right? -Hi. -I'm here to save you. Prosecutor Tieh Pu-fan will be there. What? Why are you whispering? I've told you that I'm being followed. Of course, keep it down. How did you find out that you are being followed? I tell you, I checked the files of monitor. I saw the man who walked behind me. What should I do? Should I call the police? I'm too scared to sleep. Don't worry, I'll be there tomorrow to help you. If you can't fall asleep, I think I can be with you. You'll be relieved. I mean, I can... chat with you via the phone. No, it's so weird. There's nothing weird between us. Because I'm a prosecutor and I accept your case. Therefore, I have the responsibility to protect you. You can hear my voice at least. You can calm down. Then, you can fall asleep well. Right? Okay. Hey. You are so nice. Why are you single? What happened today? Why you are so excited? Chiang-wei and I had a romantic night. I chatted with her. Not only did we talk heart to heart, we also listened to each others' breathing and felt each others' body temperature as we fall asleep together. I even dreamed about her. And... You must be so hungry. I haven't eaten yet. Well, I will go to the tutorial school today. Wang Chiang-wei is being followed. I'll investigate it. I won't wait for you. I'm leaving now. I'll drive you. You don't have to ride the bike going there. -Thank you. -I'll drive you. Little Wei, here! Little Wei! Aunty. Where are my parents? Where are my parents? Chiang-wei? Morning. Morning. What happened to her? I think she hasn't slept well in a few days. Chiang-wei. Are you okay? Chiang-wei. Old Yen is so bad. Always mean to the newcomers. Everybody, good morning. Why are you here again? The prosecutor has plenty of spare time? I see you have nothing to-- Is there a problem? Hey, I just have something to tell you. -Harassment form male colleagues? -No. I forgot to ask your contact information. Can you tell me? -Here, enter your phone number. -Okay. -Here you are. -Okay. -Done. -Yes. Sorry, you know. It's... -Okay. -Occupational disease. So, you came here today for... I'm here for Chiang-wei. She's Chiang-wei? -Yes, she is. -It's her. -Okay, take your time. -No problem. Chiang-wei. Did you sleep well last night? How could I sleep well? See my dark circles? I mean, I chatted with you last night. I thought you would be at peace. You... What are you doing? I'm investigating. Just focus on your coffee, okay? Well, where are the files? In the computer? Okay. Good resolution. It's him, right? -It's him? -Yes. Okay, have a look again. People more than 30 years old can't stay up late. You look bad. So exhausted. Cheer yourself up, Teacher Chiang-wei! Just one last class. You must show your best performance. Fighting. I know who stolen the list. It's you. Don't frame me. Do you have any evidence? I have no evidence. But I saw it. But don't worry. I won't be a whistle-blower. So you know who stole the list? Do you already know who stole the list? I'm just interested in the truth. The Black Devil we lost before is back. How could it be him? You cannot live here anymore. You can live in my house. -What? -What? That's my house. But is it really safe there? Protecting you is what I should do. Subtitle translation by Allen Yang
