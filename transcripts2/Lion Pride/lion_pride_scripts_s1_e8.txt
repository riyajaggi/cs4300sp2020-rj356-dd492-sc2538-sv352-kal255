 There has been a theft in my warehouse. Looks like the lady thief from the auction. Since you already know her identity, from now on, I'll always watch you. Why did you let him get away? Looks like re-opening the case is a bit too rushed. Prosecutor Tieh. The details of Wang family murder case have been transferred. Great. New files.

 It's still hot! I'll take over the case now. So that the investigation goes on smoothly. -Great? -Great. Can't follow up. Feeling embarrassed? You may leave now, it's none of your business. Boss, I'm sorry. But I am assigned to assist the prosecutor to investigate this murder case. Well, the bureau is running out of staff? You are the only staff left? Well... There were survivors in Wang family murder case. The eight-year-old daughter Wang Hsiao Wei.

 And also the younger sister of lady owner Kao Yu-ci, who is Wang Hsiao Wei's aunt. When the case took place, the aunt brought her to see a doctor. So they escaped the plight. -Let me check. -Take a look, boss. The house was already burning when they got home. They rushed inside to rescue the family, so they got injured. Wang Hsiao Wei was severely wounded. She woke up after resting for more than a week at the hospital. She suffered a setback. The doctor diagnosed that she suffered from PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder. She was then discharged and raised by her aunt. Subsequently, her name was changed to... Wang Chiang-wei. How come? Because his father passed away on his birthday. What a coincidence. Chiang-wei's parents also died on this day. Yes. What a coincidence. Chiang-ta's father and Chiang-wei's parents, the three of them died on the same date. No wonder Chiang-ta said that Chiang-wei is ill. So this is the problem. Poor Ms. Chiang-wei. Now that we learned about this, when we meet with Chiang-wei, -we should try to avoid-- -Boss. Protecting Ms. Chiang-wei will be my task. No, thanks. It's strange if you protect her on purpose. Just take it easy. As a witness, I'll talk to Chiang-wei's aunt first. Kao Hui-lan. You're telling me not to be worried? How can I not worry? Last time, you told me not to worry. But he came over and almost bombed my tutorial class. Don't worry. Last time was my mistake. I will restrict him after this. Just do what we planned earlier. -I guarantee your safety. -You guarantee. I'll follow your instructions, okay? As per what we planned earlier, all right? Live your ordinary lifestyle. This matter will be settled soon. It almost created a chaos. Are you happy now? So the boss stopped me because of Yen-pa? Things are still not serious enough? Do you want to ruin me as well? Hsiao Chan. I am treating you well, right? I already promised you, the rest of your lifetime will be taken care of. What else do you want? I want justice. But if Yen-pa is still useful for the boss, then I will leave him alone for the time being. Which means... you won't give up. Chiang-ta, are you looking for me? Chan Ting-hsuan escaped. You know that? I know. Such a headache for me right now. Old Yen, I need you to clarify one matter. What is it? You told me that you, Ma-sha, Chan Ting-hsuan, and Black Devil gathered at the warehouse. Two gunshots were heard. Chan was shot. He thought you shot him. So now he's seeking revenge, right? Yes. As I've reiterated, I was just a thief. I touched neither knife nor gun. How can I shoot someone? Black Devil and Chan are close friends. They agreed they're going to work together. So it can't be Black Devil. Ma-sha was the only one left at the warehouse. That's right. Why didn't I think of that? Old Yen. Could it be the chief? The chief? Impossible. Are you sure? When we met up, it was really dark. I couldn't even see my own fingers. We just confirmed each other's identity with secret codes. At that time, there was only four of us at the warehouse. Chief hasn't arrived yet. And the chief died outside the warehouse. It seemed like he was killed outside the warehouse. If my dad was chasing the criminals, he was killed before reaching the warehouse. The murderer can't be Ma-sha, Chan, Old Yen, or Black Devil, Chief was definitely the murderer. -Chiang-wei? -Ms. Si-te. What a coincidence. -You like this brand, too? -Yes. You know what? This brand has been my favorite for quite some time now. When I was little, I saw how my mom pair these bags with her shoes. And I found it very attractive. My mother passed away when I was very young. But I can still recall that she liked this brand too. Really? What a coincidence. Had they been alive now, they would make close friends. I think so too. As close as we are. Do you want to carry it and take a look? It looks good with you. But I think it looks better with you. You are a natural dresser. You look good when you carry it. Are you buying it? You can have it, doesn't matter. I am just window-shopping around here. I enjoy it when I see you carry it. All right, I'll take it, then. I'll have this. Chiang-wei you also live on that side? Right now, I'm roommates with them. So right now, the three of you all live together? Hi, Chiang-wei. Let me ask you. Hsiao-tieh is so busy. Is his schedule messed up? It's messed up. He's always working overnight and sleeping at the office. He didn't return until the next morning. Which is why Wang Chiang-ta and I have a good breakfast. He bought it for you? That's good. Even you can have it. We are housemates now. I think you are jealous. Do you like Hsiao Tieh? Yes. You are straightforward. There's no big deal. It's gender equality now. Say it if you like someone. Don't you know that? Men are not quite smart nowadays. If you don't keep on reminding them, what happens if they slip away? Some men are really not so smart. Yes. Wang Chiang-ta is not so smart. Keep quiet. He's right behind you. Chiang-wei likes Chiang-ta. But he only knows about probability. That's not going to work. That's not going to work. Not going to work. What's the matter? If either of you doesn't take the initiative, both of you will remain just friends. I'll check his intention. If he doesn't like you, forget it, then. There's Dark Queen in his heart who he'll never forget. How am I going to tell Ms. Si-te? Wang Chiang-wei is Wang Hsiao Wei. What a coincidence. Years ago, my father went after the suspect who killed her parents. Then he was killed. And he was accused of corruption. Chiang-wei and I are both victims. He loves to eat, right? Do you cook? Well, I cook light food, but I am no good cooker. No problem. I'll help you. -Really? -Yes. We'll find something to buy and cook at your house in a few days. -How about that? -That's nice. You're the chef, I'm your assistant. -What to cook, then? -Your favorite cuisine. Why are you coming to our house to cook? I found your English paper in between my Math workbook. Thanks. Two pretty girls are going to cook for you guys. Isn't that good? Are you cooking for us so we can be your lab rats? Hey. Under my supervision, she is 75% likely to succeed. -Seventy-five percent? -Yes. How did you calculate that? Based on heredity. Take a look. Whether I can cook or not, whether Chiang-wei can cook or not, there are four possibilities. We'll only fail when we both can't prepare a cuisine. What a rough calculation. -It is not probability. -All right. Speaking of probability. You will definitely have a full meal, all right? As long as you are happy. I look forward to it. How many dishes are we going to prepare? What is Hsiao Tieh's favorite? Hello? Good day. May I ask? There was a charity auction recently. An ancient lion paperweight was sold for NTD 800,000. May I know the buyer's name? All right. Thank you. I really want to buy that paper craft. Could you please help me contact the buyer? Thank you. Thank you very much. All right. Bye. If Chiang-wei gets happier when she sees this paper craft, that would be great. Since Old Yen said he repents his past mistakes. I'll let him foot the bill. Chiang-wei. This is for you. For me? What is this? Open it and take a look. Ancient lion paperweight! How did you know? I've always been longing for this. You miss your parents. This paper craft is full of your childhood memory. I put myself in your shoes, that's why I know you would like it. Thank you, Chiang-ta. How am I going to repay your kindness? Tieh, take a look. Chiang-ta gave me a gift. Hsiao Tieh. Why are you dressed up? -Are you going to be a groom? -Don't make fun of me. I'm getting married today. I must dress like a groom. The best man's suit is just for you, okay? Darling. Honey. Chiang-ta gave us a nice wedding gift. Like I've told you, Chiang-ta is not mean. My friend is a nice person. Are you two getting married? Yes. I liked you once. You just wouldn't care for me. When I was sad and down, I found out that Hsiao Tieh is always with me. So I've decided to marry him. To sum it up, you were just a passer-by. But I must thank you. Had it not been you, Chiang-wei and I wouldn't have married. Thank you so much. Fei, check how much he gave me. -Tieh Pu-fan! -You are... -Mr. Chiang-ta. -Jen-i, why are you on the floor? On the floor? Let me recall. I saw you were pondering just a while ago, so I stretched my hand to call you. And I was... Hang on. My body hurts. Anemia, Tseng Jen-i. It is anemia. Most likely anemia. I can tell. Okay. Let me get you up. -Hang on. Get up slowly. -Come on. -Watch out. -I can't move my legs. Our staff is ready. Bring it over and it will be fine. I have no other choice, haven't I? This is the easiest way. Don't worry. I'll take care of the subsequent part. You all will take care of it? If you are delaying and dilly-dallying, you'll have more trouble later. Okay. Let me make a decision soon. Give me some time, okay? Think about it. We're talking about life here. A life is at stake. All right. Let me know your decision later. I would advise you to deal with it sooner. What is Old Yen going to do? It's good. Look at you. You are leading a healthy and peaceful life. Neither painful nor ill. Every time I see you, I... a sinner like me feels relieved. Boss, please don't say that. You can see that I am energetic and vigorous. I am all right. Wang Chiang-ta is the one to be blamed. He sent me to the emergency ward as if my condition was serious. Don't worry. I am fine. I am just fine. You are a kindhearted person. Thank you. I need to ask you a private question. Yes, please. What do you think about Chou Chu's personality? Chou Chu? Which Chou Chu? The Chou Chu who killed three bad people. During The Three Kingdoms, the son of Eastern Wu general Chou Fang. -It's that Chou Chu, right? -Yes. That's him. What about him? He is good. I mean, if one learns from Chou Chu and rectifies his mistakes, if he is sincere about correcting himself to do good, does he deserve a chance to lead a new life? Of course. Shakespeare said that good people are those who have experienced making mistakes. Well, do you mean... as long as a person is like Chou Chu, who eradicates the bad people of his town and does good deeds, his past mistakes could be forgiven? I think Shakespeare wrote it to express that meaning. Really? That's great. Great. Thank goodness. -That's great. -Hey. Boss, don't pressure yourself too much. The bombing case has nothing to do with you. I am just fine. Don't worry. All right. Thank you. That's great. Thank you. Come on. Do good deeds. This is for you. Buy coffee and get one free. Something is written. Did you write it? Yes. "You can lose anything, but not your good mood." I want to tell you. The past could be tough, but there are infinite possibilities in the future. All right. Bye. That's it? What day is it? They look weird today. Think about it. We're talking about life here. A life is at stake. Hello? You've arrived in Taipei? Why so sudden? You didn't inform me. Well, I have some urgent matters. I brought you something. Wait for me at the station. I'll go there later. All right. -Ms. Si-te. -Yes? Could you do me a favor? Niu Niu asked me to help her lock the door. My aunt came to Taipei suddenly, and I need to pick her up. Can you handle this? No problem. -Be careful. -Okay. -Is it okay if you go alone? -Yes. I'll get a cab. -Okay. Be careful. -Yes. Thanks. I can help you. Let me drive you there. You'll drive me there? Yes. I'll carry those for you. That's mine. What is that for? I'm using it for some matters. All right, let's go. Put your books over there. Let's go. Si-te, have you seen Chiang-wei? She finished her lessons, right? She said her aunt came to Taipei, so she went to pick her up. It seems like Hsiao Tieh is investigating the case. He might have found out Chiang-wei was the little girl. Chiang-wei was still young back, then. Her aunt is the most important and the only witness now. Don't worry. She is not alone. Old Yen said he's handling some matters and he will drive her there. -Old Yen? -Yes. What matter is he handling? I have no idea. But he was acting weird and thoughtful. He brought scout rope with him. What is he up to? Think about it. We're talking about life here. A life is at stake. What is Old Yen trying to do? Did he fake his repentance? -I need to go now. Bye. -All right. Bye. That's right. He likes Chiang-wei. Why didn't she call back? She's not answering. What's going on? Old Yen! -Chiang-ta... -Didn't I warn you beforehand? What are you doing? Chiang-ta. Chiang-wei? What are you doing? The person who talked to me is a veterinarian from the animal clinic. We were discussing a life at stake. It is my dog, Old Seven. Old Seven is too old now. He can barely breathe. It can't walk him anymore. I don't want him to suffer any longer. My vet suggested to bring Old Seven... for euthanasia. Why did you bring a scout rope? What scout rope? What is it? You have mistaken. It's the one I was using to walk Old Seven. It's a leash. Life is uncertain. Old Seven is my only family left. But now, even OId Seven is... leaving me. Boss, are you okay? Chiang-ta, are you done with your interrogation? Almost done. What are you thinking about? Do you think my boss might harm me? The incident happened more than 20 years ago. In these two decades, I turned over a new leaf. I work hard to become a better man, to rectify my mistakes in the past. For human beings, however, when you did something wrong, it becomes a stain on a piece of paper. No matter how I clean and cover it, it is useless. When things get suspicious, Chiang-ta would suspect me. We can't blame him though. I should blame myself for my past mistakes. I can't it cover up. I can only deal with it sincerely. So that, I can be really forgiven. Just like Chou Chu, who faced his mistakes to turn a new leaf. Chiang-wei. I am sorry. -I... -Sorry. Boss, you... -What are you doing? -I feel sorry for you. I am sorry. That was how the incident transpired. That's why I saw my dad's stuff in the tutorial class. You actually stole them. Not really. Only the paper craft was stolen. I forked out my money to buy the painting. When did you find out? Why didn't you tell me? To be honest, I've known about it for a few days now. But I'm worried about how you would accept it. So I planned to tell you when the time is right. When the time is right? He was the thief. He set our house on fire. I lost my parents because of him. How could you see me working at his tutorial class and keep me in the dark? Chiang-wei. The case was serious. It was hard to tell the victims. You should not blame Chiang-ta. I'm sorry. What now? You want to cut ties now? I will kill you. Do you believe it? Your actions back then ruined a family. And you still can get away with it. I didn't get away with it. I... It was a robbery case. The police have investigated thoroughly. How could I get away with it? Once the retroactive period of the robbery is over, you will get away with it, won't you? I am sorry. I didn't expect to have mistaken a thief as my father's buddy. Yen Chang-tai! I lost my parents because of you. I don't want to see you anymore. Chiang-wei. Give me a chance to repent for my sin, all right? As you once said, good people are those who have experienced making mistakes. You agreed with that idea. When one is willing to rectify mistakes, whatever he has done, it can be forgiven. -Right? You once said-- -Stop explaining. You do not repent sincerely. -Chiang-wei. -You deal with him. Chiang-ta, you trust me, right? You trust me to repent sincerely, right? Whether I trust you or not, that's not the point. If you don't walk your talk. What is the point? That's right. Face up to it before one can be forgiven. CHANG-TAI CHINESE LANGUAGE When the truth is absent, sincerity does not hold water. SUSPECTED VICTIMS? CHIEF? POLICE? For you all, I won't need to be forgiven. Chief. You ruined two families. Who are you indeed? Same as Chiang-ta, you knew it earlier? Old Yen was among the thieves who set my house on fire. I learned it today by checking investigative papers. You changed your name. Aunt. Did you come to Taipei for this matter? Chiang-wei, it is such a hurry today. I saw your name as well as your aunt's in the file. According to the procedure, I must first talk to your aunt. So I am the last one to know about this? You all have been keeping me in the dark. I couldn't be long-winded over phone calls. All right. I am also a witness. I will follow. -Sure. If you can... -Hey. Chiang-wei was just a little girl back then. She was suffering from a fever. When the case took place, we were not in the house. I didn't know much about the case, let alone Chiang-wei. Hsiao Tieh. Your aunt is right. Chiang-wei. You suffered from PTSD. You should not recall an old memory. Fine. Because of my PTSD, you guys are keeping me in the dark and excluding me out of the case. Chiang-wei. Madam. Chiang-wei can't remember the incident at all? When the case occurred, she was suffering from a fever. Her condition was bad. When she got and saw the fire, she got injured again. The scar on her was deep and painful. I took care Chiang-wei since she was little. Whether you or the police are dealing with her, please do make sure she is safe and happy. That is my utmost responsibility. Madam, I understand that. But Hsiao Tieh has a duty. I beg your pardon. That's right, madam. It is also my job to ensure Chiang-wei's safety and happiness. I will protect her. Thank you. As long as it is good for Chiang-wei, I am willing to do anything for her. What's the problem? I know you don't care about the quality of life. But that was exaggerated. As you know, I must make sure my favorite girl have a good sleep. It is worth sacrificing for. -Tieh Pu-fan. -What now? You have the details of the case. Did you find out anything? I knew it. You're not going to check on me out of nothing. I want to ask you too. How did you know that Chiang-wei was Wang Hsiao Wei? Mr. Chin told me indeed. Mr. Chin knew Chiang-wei's dad. Both families had close ties. Chiang-wei learned antique authentication from Mr. Chin. I see. You know Chiang-wei better than I do. Terrific. I learned about her story and saw her face. I sympathize her. That's right. When I learned about her background, and the background she hailed from, I sympathize and admire her. I just said "sympathize," and you mimicked me. "I sympathize and admire her." Since you are here, we shall talk frankly, then. You said you admire and sympathize her. Do you like her? You can't get away with silence all the time. You make me guess a lot. We are good friends. We know each other very well. I know you like her. All right. I do care for Chiang-wei. I have a preference for her. That means you like her! You are pretending... You might have thought of this. Before this, I told you I like Chiang-wei and I want to protect her. I also told you that I am serious about her. So you decided to give way. Correct? Is my guess accurate? Let me tell you. In the world of love, giving way is not the way out. Who is your competitor? Tieh Pu-fan. Do I need you to give way? Or I learned that she was Dorothy and I started to like her. Dorothy of the radio program? The one who often shared bad jokes? That's right. -In fact, I knew nothing-- -All right. All right. I know it. Let me tell you. Whenever you make up your mind, whenever you're ready to take actions, I wouldn't mind. Let me tell you. You fight for your own happiness, nobody is going to give way. We are good friends, but we still have fair competition. Chiang-ta, let me remind you. Tieh Pu-fan does not give up mates for dates. Chiang-wei will have the final say. I understand. I won't give way. What are you laughing at? You... Sorry! Sorry. Sorry! Hsiao Tieh is too much. Making noise this late at night. Don't get mad. Have you gotten used to having two male housemates? They are good people. I have gotten used to it. Aunt. My parents died in a fire accident. Can you share more details with me-- Chiang-wei. You don't look good. Did you have a good rest? Let me tell you. Youthfulness is your capital. You have to take care of it while you're still young. Look at your face. You burned the midnight oil and overworked yourself. You've lost a lot of collagen. Let me show you. Take a look. I had collagen powder from Aunt Liu next door. The drink is thick and has low calories. It contains caramel. Look at me. When I go out recently, I rarely wear makeup. Let me see. It looks familiar. Rings a bell now. Ms. Si-te at our tutorial class. She's also drinking it. Your colleague is consuming it, you must not lose out. I'll order for you. Order processed. Take a look. I made an order with your name. Aunt, you made a mistake. It contains ceramide. Not caramel. POOG collagen. Not PPAP. Let me tell you. You can't memorize such things. You must have an understanding of things to remember them. When I teach history to my students, I don't give emphasis on memorization. I want them to understand first how the stories transpired. So they'll be able to master the subject in a comprehensive manner. -You know that? -Yes, Ms. Wang. All right. Whatever Caramel or PPAP. I bought it and you must have it. Smart girls maintain a good health. -Take a good rest. -Sleep well. Thank you. Madam Kao Hui-lan. I would like to ask you this. In 1994, Wang family encountered a fatal robbery case. Please tell me the facts. Our conversation will be recorded. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Great. When the case occurred, my elder sister and brother-in-law were scheduled to visit Hong Kong. Chiang-wei had a fever. So I came over to take care of her. I brought her to see a doctor. When we got home, the house was already burning. My first reaction was to stop the fire. I brought Chiang-wei into the house, but we got trapped inside. Thankfully, firefighters arrived on time. They rescued us. Subsequently, I learned that my sister and brother-in-law were killed in the house. Prosecutor Tieh, as for other matters, don't let the cat out of the bag. Chiang-wei always thought that her parents were killed in the fire accident. I don't want Chiang-wei to have other thoughts. I've taken note of your request. We will think about it and handle the matter carefully. Your statement and our findings are in sync. Do you drive? No, I don't. When you brought Hsiao Wei to see a doctor, what public transport did you take? What time you did you leave and arrive at home? Rings a bell? It should be a taxi. As for exact time, I can't recall. Which hospital did you visit? Do you still remember? No, sir. I can't remember. When children fall ill, the elders usually go around their places or visit familiar hospitals and clinics. How could you forget that? I lived in Tainan. I went all the way to Taipei to take care of Chiang-wei. I didn't know where they usually sought medical treatment. Understood. According to firefighters' statement, they broke in from back door. They found you and Hsiao Wei around the back door area. Since you were home, why did you take the back door instead of the front door? When we got home, the front door was already on fire. It was set ablaze. The fire was not that serious at the back door. So we entered from back door. But you saw the house caught fire, why did you still bring Hsiao Wei in? If I left her outside the house, she would be in great fear. So I brought her in. Thank you for the interview today. It is my duty to talk to the prosecutor and the police. -You may ask me any questions. -All right. Please don't ask Chiang-wei. She suffers from PTSD. I don't want her to recall unhappy memory. Aunt... Madam Kao. Rest assured. It is our duty to protect the litigants. Aunt. The case happened a long time ago. But Hsiao Tieh reopened the investigation. Is there any new evidence? I didn't ask him. I am not sure. I only told him what I know. This pair looks good. Mister. -Hello. -Can we try this pair? -Sure. One moment, please. -Thank you. Aunt. After the incident, I remembered that I was hospitalized for a long time. I can't recall other matters. You told me the details. But deep in my heart, I feel something strange. The trauma must be causing you a lot of confusion. Doctors diagnosed it as cognitive bias. Don't think too much. Every time I'm having a nightmare, I'm dreaming of you leading me out of the fire scene. It was as if we've already been inside the house. Aunt. When the incident took place, was I home? I don't know why you're having nightmares. The truth is what I've already told you. The doctor said you fall ill. Don't you trust me? Human memory is not reliable. Miss, here's your pair of shoes. All right, thank you. Try it out. How is it? Not bad. I have good taste, right? Forget about the sad story. Buy a nice pair of shoes to give you a good mood. -We'll buy this pair of shoes. -Sure. -I'll send you off at the station. -Okay. Why did it suddenly rain? I am soaked in rain. I should take a shower now. Why did you come out of nowhere? Why are you using my towel? -You have a bad habit. -My towel was sent to the laundry. Can't I borrow yours? You stingy guy. The scar on her back that Dorothy mentioned must be from when Wang Hsiao Wei left the fire scene. Dad. Do you know the day when you didn't come home to celebrate my birthday was also the day when Chiang-wei got the scar on her back? And also the day I got the scar in my heart. I am not sure when it is going to recover. I am returning your stingy towel. Didn't I tell you not to enter my room? Come on. Please go out. What secrets you are hiding in your room? Is tortoise your Chinese zodiac? I hide no secrets. What about tortoise? What joke is it? Because yours is a lone tortoise's room. What a poor joke. You're great that you said it. Aren't you laughing? You are Dorothy's loyal fan. You ate breakfast, but left your mug and cup on the table. The floor is oily. Tenant, mind your habits. It's not my fault. Hsiao Tieh left them. But I can clean it for him. -It doesn't matter. -Hsiao Tieh left them? Yes. Are you okay? I'm fine. I am fine because I was well-trained. Thank you. Lion Wang Chiang-ta who protects Dorothy. Boss, I really need your help. I thought you are a great officer now? Why do you still need my help? The surveillance records of Lien family and auction venue are being pointed to the thief suspect, Kuan Ching-ching I requested to collect evidence from the witnesses. But they declined. What are their reasons? I contacted the assistant of Lien Chong-yen. He said it is inconvenient. He also added that the case happened many years ago, there is no need to follow up the investigation. The robbery falls under prosecutors' jurisdiction. -They must cooperate. -That's right, boss. Please help me this time around. Apply for a search warrant from the court. No need. I'll persuade him. I'll visit the office tomorrow to look for Lien Chong-yen. -Hello? -Hsiao Tieh. Please come home tonight. What's up? Why all of a sudden? You'll find out when you get home. We're close friends. Why are you being secretive? Spare the nonsense. I am very busy. What happened? Why did you ask me to come home? I just miss you so much. So I was eager to get you home. You can't blame me, right? Silly girl. Tell me directly. Let's take a shower. Be quick. See you later. Remember. -Don't eat dinner yet. -All right. I'll listen to you. I'll go home after work. Bye. Get lost! What do you want from me? Why did Ms. Chiang-wei call you? What a silly question. Ms. Chiang-wei and I are intimate friends. We're very close friends. Something you didn't expect. Get out. Chiang-wei, I am home. Wang Chiang-ta. Si-te? Hello, Hsiao Tieh. You are here. Everybody is here? Ms. Si-te and I are going to cook dinner. -May I help out? I... -No, thanks. You watch TV with Chiang-ta. -It will be done shortly. -All right. No problem. Why did Si-te come over? She wants to cook us dinner. All of a sudden? Had I mastered my skills at guitar club, I would have known more than one chord. I could have created a better atmosphere by now. Hsiao Tieh, I must remind you as a friend. You are not gifted in music. Some things don't change along with time. Even if you learn for another ten years, your skills will stay the same. You better give it up earlier. I'm singing for a bored cow like you. Singing songs for a cow? Who else do I love? If not for you. What is our relationship? Forget it. I shall not sing. Your music sense is terrible. Watch TV, then. Ms. Si-te. What are you cooking today? I am going to cook Clam spaghetti with white wine. And also potato soup. Those are my favorite dishes. You are great. No big deal. I am learning from the cookbook. How may I help you? I'll clear the sand from the clams. Sure. Thank you. Clear the sand? From the clams. Don't you know that? Watch out! Stop it. The garlic could get overcooked. Overcooked? Ms. Si-te, do you really cook? Yes, I do. But I am not doing well today. Since I just learned the dishes from the cookbook, I haven't really cooked it before. You don't even know how to slice potatoes. I thought you once told me that you studied abroad and you used to cook all your meals? That's right. I used to make sandwiches. I just put the pickled meat into the cooker and that's it. I see. When I was in New York, I ate instant noodles for one whole week. I got sick of it. So I came up with a new method. Instant noodles? -Just a moment. -Is dinner ready? -Well... -I'm starving. Are you two messing up the kitchen? -Do you need some help? -No worries. Just a moment. Wait for a while. -Chiang-wei. -Yes? Is there any cooked food for us right now? Not really. Two little boys, please be patient. We'll have dinner soon. Go. -They must be cooking a big meal. -Go away. We shall have a drink for a while. All right. We shall eat now. Sorry to have kept you waiting. -So it is an instant-noodle dinner. -Yes. Please help yourself. All right. Well... I find your instant-noodle dinner very impressive. -It must be delicious. -Give it a try. -Taste it. -Okay. Delicious. Its color looks good. It is really yummy. Oh, my! I was so nervous. This is my debut cooking at a friend's place. I actually am not doing well today. I didn't plan to cook this. But I failed to make my planned dishes. How pitiful. -I am sorry. -Don't worry. The three of us love eating instant noodles. -Really? -Yes. Right? We love it. I should practice more at home. Next round, I'll prepare new dishes to surprise you all. You can spare the next round. He means he Hsiao Tieh are going to cook for us. -That's right. Well... -Give me another chance. Hsiao Tieh and I can cook for you two. Chiang-ta and I are good cooks. Hsiao Tieh? Is it too salty? You're drinking that all the time. Not really. It is too tasty and I just don't feel like eating it. The saltiness is just fine. You like strong taste, right? You should have this. It is spicy. Do you prefer sweet taste? Why do you know me so well? I love salty and spicy food. I prefer sweet taste. -Soulmate. -Is it slightly salty? Not salty. The taste is just fine. How about you two? I eat any dishes as long as I'm not full. I don't like spicy and sweet taste. As for me, I prefer mild taste. I like desserts, too. You like dessert. Let me tell you. A restaurant in Taipei offers good tea cuisine. -I'll bring you there. -Really? Really. -The four of us should go. -Sure. -Sure. -I can arrange my time. -Okay. We shall go together. -All right. I was going to treat Chaing-wei. Am I supposed to treat all of you now? Chiang-ta doesn't like dessert. You don't like dessert, do you? I may order other dishes. Thank you for being so generous, Tieh. -Thank you, Hsiao Tieh. -Thank you, Tieh. All right, that's enough. We'll go when I'm free. I have been busy recently. Too many tasks pile up and I might find it overwhelming. I might look for your dad tomorrow. -Look for my dad? -Yes. What's the matter? Something in your warehouse was stolen. We cross-checked the surveillance records. It was the same suspect who stole painting during the auction. We requested to collect evidence at your home again. But your dad's assistant declined. My dad is stubborn. I can accompany you tomorrow. I might be able to help you. It would be great if you come along. Aren't you busy in your tutorial classes? Now that Chiang-wei resigned. Can you get a day off? You resigned? Since when? What's wrong with my tummy? They didn't clean the clams. Hold on. What's the matter? -What? -Help me do the dishes. I thought Tieh Pu-fan love doing dishes? -I kept it for you. -Hey. Don't treat me that way. The girls cooked for us, it is reciprocal if we do the dishes. They cooked in my house, which means I provided the kitchen. While you haven't done anything. -You should do the dishes. -Come on. We always share blessings and misfortunes. Aren't we friends? Tell me. Yes, we are. -This is your portion of blessing. -Come on. This is misfortune. The two girls are out there, right? They're having a great time chatting. You'll be embarrassed if you go out. Do the dishes with me, so that we strengthen our friendship. -All right, I'll help. Don't touch me. -Be good. -What are you doing? -Doing the dishes. Are you unhappy now? -Why am I unhappy? -Doing dishes unwillingly! Sorry. Help! -Okay. Enough. -That's enough. Hang on. Help me brush... Oh, my. I didn't know Old Yen was like that. I couldn't stay any longer either, if I were you. I don't know how to deal with Old Yen, so I decided to quit the tutorial class. He said he was only involved in the theft. But he was still involved in the case of our family. Chiang-wei. Those who did something wrong, should never be forgiven. Don't think too much, all right? If you need any help during this period, just let me know. Don't keep it to yourself. -Thank you. -Don't think too much. Hey! You! -Hey! -You two boys. Classmate Tieh, classmate Wang. It is late now. Are you guys doing the dishes or taking a shower? -Ma'am, it is Wang's duty. -Rinse the plates and I am drying it up. -You rinse them. -All right. Either one is fine. That's enough. You dampened the floor. Take your shower now. I'll go first! Hey! You are so mean! -All right. I should leave now. -Okay. Tell me if you need help. -Okay. Let me walk you out. -Okay. -Rest well. No need walk me out. -All right. I'll take a shower first. You get out. How irritating. I may have encountered a misfortune in my life. But I am still fortunate to have met you all. Get lost. I'll bath myself. Don't need your help. Hey, boys, stop fooling around. Do you keep stealthy stuff in your warehouse? What stealthy stuff? All right, then. Let the prosecutor check. All right. If you need to collect evidence, I'll get someone to help you. Thank you for your cooperation. All right. I'll make a move now. Thank you. Thank you. Why are you here? I'm also instructed by someone do you know that? You said someone instructed you. But you did not dare to disclose it. Did he instruct you? Dad, you instructed him to blackmail me? I know you dislike my tutorial job. You always wanted me to quit. Did you ask others to blackmail me because of this? You used dirty tricks, so that I can no longer work as a tutor? I instructed him to come up with an idea, so that you will quit. But this foolish man came up with such a poor approach. Miss. Boss is not involved-- To come up with an idea, means you're instructing him, right? Am I such a despicable person? You are not despicable. You adopted dirty tactics. Well... Don't get agitated now. -Talk slowly. -Fine. It is all my fault. Shut up! You are my only daughter. I gave you the best. I sent you to the United States to earn your master's degree. I don't want you to waste your talent in tutorial class. You are my daughter. Only you can help my business. But you are telling me this? I don't like complicated relationships. I want nothing to do with your business. I am doing the job that I like? What's wrong with it? Why do you treat me this way? You've crossed the line. Si-te. What are you talking about? Boss. Really frustrating. It was my dad's idea. Who would have thought that? How is it possible? Don't be sad. I'll withdraw the charge regarding the blackmail. Don't worry. All right. Thank you. Hsiao Tieh. -Chiang-ta. -Si-te is here too? Some important matters need to be sorted out soon. Should I leave now? No need. I'm about to leave anyway. -I'll go ahead. -Take care. -Update me as things unfold. -Sure. Thank you. Just started the day, but I am exhausted already. May I listen to Ms. Kao's statement? You did not come for a meal? I ate already. I just sent one off and you came by. Do you want to increase my workload? PROSECUTOR TIEH PU-FAN The points of Ms. Kao's statement are contradicting and suspicious. It still makes sense, if one can't recall much of the case, which happened many years ago. However, I can still smell a rat. Can you be serious? Ms. Kao is among the victims. She wants the culprits to be caught, too. You're thinking too much. You're right, though. The only logic to justify Ms. Kao's contradicting points, is that she was overprotective of Chiang-wei. That is my speculation. She worries for Chiang-wei too much. She reminded me today not to mention the case to Chiang-wei. So that Chiang-wei won't recall a sad memory. That's right. It was tough for Chiang-wei to go through it back then. That's true. One more matter. Lien Chong-yen's painting was stolen. The source was unclear. But Kuan Ching-ching alleged that the painting is related to the painting that Wang family lost during the auction. She talked halfway through and disappeared. What is in her mind? You better get serious. Kuan Ching-ching likes you. She gives foolish excuses to approach you and win your attention, don't you get it? I am serious and you are not. I met her twice or thrice. She discussed the case with me. Not romantic relationship. Wang Chiang-ta, you are naive. Modern girls are unlike those in the earlier years. Conventional ladies were introvert. But now, the girls take the initiative. They crave for love. Do you know that? It is also a trouble to be such a handsome guy. We are in the same boat. I have been under attack lately. I almost can't withstand it. -Prosecutor Tieh. -What's up today? Any matter, Old Yen? Chiang-ta is here. I need your favor on a matter. Please tell us. I made mistakes when I was young. Right now, I sincerely want to turn a new leaf. I will now return this work of Chiang-wei's dad. I happened to have kept it. I'll return to her as a token of apology. But she wouldn't talk to me. May I ask for a favor from both of you? You committed theft crime back then. But you now cooperate with our investigation. Ms. Kao will be glad to witness your change and effort. Well. Ms. Kao doesn't want Chiang-wei to be overwhelmed by the past. If you are sincere in solving this case, it is also your kindness. -Let me help you. -Thank you. I knew this case for so long. You said you were involved in the theft, but not the murder case. Unti you prove your innocence, until the case has been resolved, I will still suspect you. Which is why I can't help you. Chiang-ta. Old Yen, it doesn't matter. He is straightforward. His stance is correct, though. Understand. I understand. So I will pass the painting to you, Prosecutor Tieh. As things unfold, please update me again. Sure. Keep in touch. All right. I'll leave now. -Take care. -Thank you. You're welcome. Could an apology erase the nightmare and sufferings of someone else? Wang Chiang-ta's pants? Acronym of my name. Isn't this the bracelet that I lost at Lightless Restaurant? Why is it here? You are the son of said police officer. Committing crime or not, you don't have a say. 7:00 p.m. tomorrow. Let me show you something. It looks nice. I like a guy. You should help me woo him. Wang Chiang-wei. Can I really fall in love with you? Subtitle translation by BK Yeow
