 You resigned? He was the thief. I lost my parents because of him. Do you like her? Isn't this the bracelet that I lost at Lightless Restaurant? Why is it here? Since I resigned, my day became long. I have a few authentication jobs. Replacement classes are rare. HSIAO TIEH

 Hsiao Tieh. -Hello? -Hello? Chiang-wei. What are you doing? Are you feeling bored? I thought of something to do tonight. How about walking and eating at a night market? It's good to be home. -I don't feel like going out. -Doesn't matter. Listen. There are restaurants that offer delicious seafood. -We must try the clam soup. -Hold on. They have an oyster omelet. Let me tell you. -The whole oyster... -Chiang-ta. -Hsiao Tieh, I'll call you back. -Hello? -Chiang-ta. -Chiang-wei. What are you doing?

 Do you want to have a meal together? I'm very free. What do you want to have? There is a nice bar in Riverside. Incoming call again? Hello? Nothing. -I'll update you on the address. -Okay. Teacher Si-te? Hello? Chiang-wei, what are you doing? Are you free later today? Why am I so popular today? Everybody is asking me out. What should I do? But I have just promised to go with Chiang-ta. I feel so bad. Can we have a drink? I already have plans for tonight. Teacher Si-te seems sad. Should I turn Chiang-ta down? It's all right. If you're not free, let's go for a drink next time. Teacher Si-te, hang on. I'll see what I can do. I'll call you back later. -Hello? Chiang-ta? -Chiang-wei. I've found the address. I'll send it to you now. Hello? -Hello? Si-te? -Hello? Hsiao Tieh? Are you free later today? -Tonight? Well... -That's right. Si-te feels sad because of her dad's problem. She needs someone to talk to. But Chiang-wei hasn't replied yet. Fei. Urgent case? All right. I'll check it out. Well. I have work coming in. Let me handle my work first then I'll call you back later. Asking to go out tonight. What a coincidence. -Hello? -Hello? We shall meet at a bar in Riverside at 7:00 p.m. You said River... Riverside Bar? I want to go on a date with Chiang-ta. But Teacher Si-te needs someone right now. How about... asking her to go out with us. SI-TE Teacher Si-te. See you at 7:00 p.m. tonight at Riverside Bar. I'll send you the address later. Bye. She found a place? I have to inform Hsiao Tieh now. Wang Chiang-ta rarely asks me out. I have something to do tonight. I can't make it. Doesn't matter. Good thing Hsiao Tieh can't make it. Otherwise, I might have needed to cancel my own plans. Hsiao Tieh? -Hello. -Chiang-wei. I thought it's only going to be me and Chiang-wei? Hsiao Tieh. Oh, hello. What now? Same combination as yesterday? Why do you have flowers with you? I attended my friend's wedding ceremony. I got these there. The four of us coming together. The probability is... Hsiao Tieh is here? I thought you said you're busy? I thought it was only Chiang-wei. -Things didn't go on as I thought. -Things didn't go on as I thought. Knowing that your father was the one who blackmailed you, you must feel very bad. Why did he do that? -Drink it slowly. -Drink slowly. As the saying goes, tigers don't eat their own babies. Why would biological parents set their kids up? You don't know my dad. This is my dad. He uses dirty tactics to achieve his goals. We fought a lot about this. And now, he set me up. -You... -Drink slowly. -You'll get drunk. -That's right. We are here to drink. Where are your glasses? Chiang-wei, hurry up. Drink with me, come on. -Be happy. -All right. Hey. Wang Chiang-ta. Why aren't you drinking? Yeah. Aren't you drinking? Hurry. I don't drink. Drink one glass with me. I'll drink his. Excuse me. Chiang-ta has the bracelet that I lost earlier. -Is Chiang-ta that person? -Hello? Stop drinking. Mr. Wang, we told the buyer about your sincerity. The buyer agreed to meet with you. We can't guarantee if he really wants to sell it though. I understand. Thank you. Bye. I have something to ask you. So I came along. Me too. I have something to tell you. -I... -Well... How about this? You go ahead first. We share a common background. I can put myself in your shoes. Sometimes, we don't want others to worry about us. We pretend that we can handle everything. You don't need to act strong in front of me. You can be yourself. This feeling... This feeling... Seems familiar. -I don't need to say much. -I don't need to say much. She knows what I'm about to say. All right... Let me ask you. When I was arranging the clothes. I saw a bracelet in your pocket. It has W.K. engraved on it. Is this your surprise for me? It belongs to my friend. Is it your friend's? Who is it? I quite like it. How about you give it to me? Don't forget. You owe me one. You must follow my requests unconditionally. But not this thing. I have to return it to my friend. It's not mine. I knew you won't give it to me. Stingy Sherlock. I met a friend at Lightless Restaurant. She forgot to take it. I have been waiting for a chance to give it back to her. A friend at Lightless Restaurant. Therefore, the Dark Queen that Hsiao Tieh mentioned, she's the owner of this bracelet? Dark Queen is a nickname given by Hsiao Tieh. I tried different ways to find her. I didn't see her every time I visited Lightless Restaurant I... I will look for her and return it. When I left the restaurant, I found out that I lost the bracelet. I returned to check, the boss said the man at the same table took it. Therefore, Dark Queen is actually me. I didn't know that Dark Queen is important to you. Well... All right. I'll return it. Thank you. You didn't run into her. Is that why you always visit the Lightless Restaurant? You're trying your luck? Not anymore. The probability of running into her is one in a million. Furthermore, I pay attention to people who are more important. Wang Chiang-ta. I thought you get to the bottom of everything? Why are you giving up halfway through? Also, you're good at math. You can calculate this. For one to meet a soulmate, the chance is very low. Did I count the wrong probability? Not really. Forget it. Let me ask you this. If it's not going to be the bracelet, can you can promise me something else? Sure. However, you have to think carefully. I gave you good conditions. Think about it well, then tell me. I'll do it for you. I like a guy. You should help me woo him. Is it Hsiao Tieh? Sure. Who is it? The fifth word of the sentence I just said. I LIKE A GUY YOU SHOULD HELP ME WOO HIM "You"? Is it me? This is a big world. You ran into me. I ran into you. That's great. Her hair smells so familiar. As if I've smelled it before. Wang Chiang-wei. Can I really fall in love with you? You may only drink this once I come back. I'll look for Chiang-wei and Chiang-ta. They've been gone for a long time. -I'll go with you. -You don't have to. You stay here and have a rest. Seriously... I'll go. Let's go. Come on. Let me go with you. -Hang on. -Where is it? -Are you okay? -I'm fine. All right. You are a boy. What's your reaction? Sorry. Well... I mean... You... I... We shouldn't drink a lot. Good thing, I brought your jacket. Otherwise, you would freeze to death. Button it up. Is there a button here? This is... -Fei! -What? Fei? Where is he? No. Fei is not around. -Flying objects! -What? Flying... Flying object? Why would there be a flying... Are you... Are you drunk? Are you okay? -All right. -I feel like vomiting. Let me give them a call. -Please don't. -What? Can't I ring them up? Because... Because Though you may stop admiring Chiang-wei, you'll still feel sad. You... We shall leave now. Let's go. Let me hold you. My phone. It's from Hsiao Tieh. -Si-te feels unwell. -Take a look. I'll send her home. It seems like it's only you and me here. Hsiao Tieh. Let me ask you something. This is a hypothesis. Hypothetically, if Chiang-wei eventually chooses Chiang-ta, what would you do? I've never thought of this problem. My idea is this. When a man and a woman are still unmarried, there's still hope until the last moment. Are you going back to the tutor class? Did you leave your stuff there? Not really. I had a fight with my dad today. I don't feel like going home. I don't want to bother my friends. And all I could think of is to spend the night at the tutor class. No way. I don't think that's a good idea. As a gentleman, I can't let that happen. A girl staying overnight at the tutor class. That's too much. Hsiao Tieh, you're really caring. But I'm fine. Don't worry about me. It's not a problem. I have an idea. Stay at our place. I've always thought of myself as a prime number. Alone in the world. But you appeared unexpectedly. You are the number one. Only you can divide me. There's me and you. Shall I give you a nickname? Chiang-ta honey? Chiang-ta baby? My big cat? Or Sweetheart Wang? Is a nickname so important? Of course. Nicknames mean we've accepted each other. You're good at math. Arrange the combinations and pick one. Tell me later. Nicknames mean we've accepted each other. Mr. W? MR. W There is a W on Dark Queen's bracelet. This W represents Dark Queen's name? W.K. Is this your surprise for me? I met a friend at Lightless Restaurant. She forgot to take it. Therefore, the Dark Queen that Hsiao Tieh mentioned, she's the owner of this bracelet? When I mentioned the Lightless Restaurant, Chiang-wei relates that the bracelet belongs to Dark Queen. Chiang-wei's surname is Wang. W is for "Wang." Her hair smells so familiar. As if I've smelled it before. It's W. Dark Queen... is Wang Chiang-wei. Why didn't I realize it? Love makes us stupid. Wang Chiang-ta of The Wizard of Oz. I can't sleep. How cute. Tao Le-ssu. How about counting lions? One lion. Two lions. Three lions. Four lions. Counting lions doesn't work. -I still can't sleep. -Still can't sleep? What do I do now? Can you count pork meatballs? It's food. Think of food and you'll sleep well. Good night. Good night. Good morning. Good morning. Why did you get up one hour earlier than usual? I thought about getting up earlier to cook you breakfast. Why did you wake up earlier? I... There are lazy ladies, but not ugly ladies. I wanted to get up early to make myself prettier. You should wake up later than I do. All right. The early bird gets the worm. I'll cook you breakfast. I'll go with you. Tieh Pu-fan. You're not sleeping in your room? Why did you sleep here? -Well, you... -I'm... Are you all right? You don't look well. You caught a cold, right? Good morning. Si-te? Teacher Si-te, you... It's not what you think... Gosh. What a full breakfast. Chiang-ta, you're a breakfast cooker. I shall eat now. Hsiao Tieh. You caught a cold. -Drink fruit juice. -Okay. Get more vitamin C. Thank you. The four of us are having breakfast together. It's great. I'm glad to have another girl at home. That's great. It's been a while since I had breakfast with friends. I feel great. For consecutive days, -you two are getting along. -Who? This is the third day I saw you two getting along well. Sorry, I didn't inform you earlier. I came over late night yesterday. You caught a cold because of me. -Not really. -I'm really sorry. It doesn't matter. Sorry. I was interrogating a suspect yesterday. I think he had the flu. So don't blame yourself. Your cold got serious because of me. Because you slept in the living room, right? Not really. May I cook you chicken soup after work? I can cook it. -Let me boil chicken soup. -Well... Si-te, don't worry. I'll buy chicken soup takeaway. I know a restaurant that sells delicious chicken soup. -I know that restaurant too! -That's right! -That's really nice. -Near our place. -My favorite. -That's right... -Don't worry. -They'll buy it. -Seriously. -That's right. Hello? I'll return to the campus later. Sure. See you. Your university gave you a ring. -To resume your teaching position? -Yeah. It was agreed to be a semester. It's about time. Congratulations. You have a really bad flu. You don't need to report to work today, right? -You must call in sick. -Yes. No way. The global justice alliance can never survive without me. Hsiao Tieh. Speaking of justice alliance in the world, if you are absent for one day, it would still function well. -But we can't afford to lose you. -Yeah. We wish you a speedy recovery. Chiang-ta, you uttered humane words when I'm ill. That's really... Excuse me. I'll leave now. I'll eat out. Si-te, cook him chicken soup. Hey... Come on in. Director. You're finally back. What happened? Why are my stuff transferred here? A number of incidents took place. Since you withdrew from the outstanding teachers list, the Math Department stopped receiving allocations. We have to cut our budget. Due to renovation at the old building, your research office is moved here. I have filled up everything. Left your signature, personal seal, and signing date. Let's see when you can return to the university. But I can't give you an exact answer now. I still need to handle some matters. The sooner, the better. MR. WANG THIS IS ABOUT THE AUCTION THE BUYER WANTS TO MEET UP. PLEASE REPLY SOON. THANKS. -Chiang-wei. -Your plain water. Sure. Chiang-wei, thank you. No problem. Take a rest. It's okay. Let me sit up for a while. You treat me well. Don't mention it. You treat me well too. I treat you well. But it's different from what you think. What do you mean? Well... Since I knew you, I make every effort to make you happy. To buy you good food. I did everything for you. So I can become the special person in your life. What kind of joke is this? Do you joke around when you're sick? Chiang-wei, I'm not... I'm not kidding. I have been serious with you all this time. I'm not kidding. Lately, I felt that... If I don't tell you now, it might be too late already. I like you very much. I really like you. I like you to the extent that if I don't tell you now, I will regret it forever. So I would like to give it a try. Chiang-wei, I would now ask you seriously. Can you be my girlfriend? Well... I knew it. You don't have to answer me now. Well... I know that if you give me an answer now, I would hardly recover. It's all right. It's all right. Let me hold you. Let me hold you. Tieh Pu-fan. You knew you'd lose. But you used a poor tactic. The tutor class is so quiet now. It would be great if Teacher Chiang-wei is here. I tried to call her. I sent her text messages. She didn't reply. I would do the same. -Do you know what's going on? -Yes, I do. What's going on? Help me persuade her. Say nice things about me. I told you. I won't entertain you either if I were her. What's the matter? It's better if you don't know. I'm mad. That's right. You're better off not knowing it. I'm the only person who is kept in the dark. Forget it. It's strange. Teacher Chiang-ta never took a leave. But now, he's taking a long leave. It's annoying to take up his classes. What's the problem? You always enjoy replacement. You have no idea. Students from his elite class are peculiar. They keep asking me tough questions. You know that? I can solve their questions. But the point is, those are not exam questions. Why do they keep asking? I miss Teacher Wang Chiang-ta. -He's coming. -That would be good. I'll hug him when he comes around. Teacher Chiang-ta? I miss you so much. Old Yen. The matter regarding Chiang-wei. You said you're willing to make up for your mistakes. That you're willing to do anything. Right? Chiang-ta. Come on. There are outsiders here. As I have said, as long as Chiang-wei accepts my apology, I'm willing to do anything. All right. You have a chance now. You sold the ancient lion paperweight. Remember that? That was among the stolen items from her family. It means a lot to her. Through the auction company, I contacted the buyer. They are willing to meet up. It's possible to buy back, if things go on smoothly. -That's great. -However, you will need to pay. I'll pay. What originally belongs to Chiang-wei, should be returned to her accordingly. I've thought about it. I can't force her to forgive me. But I can do good deeds to repent for my sin bit by bit. Sure. One more thing. I promised you that I would teach for one semester. When the semester ends, I'll quit the tutor class. Chiang-wei resigned. Even my top teacher Wang Chiang-ta is about to leave. No way. Teacher Chiang-ta, we the arms of Chang-tai Tutorial Class. We can't afford to lose each other. Without me, you would still do well. Teacher Chiang-ta. Fei, we shall discuss tomorrow. -I'm unwell today. -Big brother, listen up. A soy sauce factory has been raided. They made subpar products by using industrial materials. A discovery was shocking. What's the shocking discovery? Can you tell me? Luo Ing-ping is the factory director. Who is nicknamed Black Dog. This person happens to know Chiang-wei's creditor, Sun Hsiao-shan. They used to be close. During the murder case of Sun Hsiao-shan, a thorough investigation was conducted. But no evidence was found. They can't escape justice. Carry on with your investigation. This factory was powerful. They had somebody lobbying in the bureau. I worry that they might tamper with our investigation. If they tamper with the investigation, that means something is fishy. Carry on then. Investigate it and report to me later, okay? Big brother. I don't know when. But you've become so proactive. I really admire you. I'm not free to entertain you. Bye. How annoying. Fei, you're noisy. I'm going out now. There's some flu medicine on the desk. Take it if you feel unwell. Flu medicine is not what I need now. Your answer is my only solution. If I try harder, the answer for my question just now, would it become a yes? Hsiao Tieh, you and I are the same. I treasure the person I like and never think of other possibilities. Wang Chiang-ta. You're a lucky guy. Are you okay? Do you still have a headache? It's a heartache! Wang Chiang-ta, you've won. Why didn't he reply? Is he seriously ill that he can't even reply to messages? You're really annoying. Big brother, I know you're unwell. I came over to pay you a visit. I brought you your favorite banana. Banana is your favorite. Answer the door, monkey. Take a rest. I'll take care of it. How may I help you? Is Ms. Chiang-wei home? She went out. I can take it for her. It's our company policy. You must prove your identity if you're receiving the parcel on her behalf. You are her... Frankly speaking, I'm her future boyfriend. Is it funny? Is it fun? Foolish. Sorry. I'm her future husband. Yes, please. Thank you. I'll get it for my wife. Thank you. Why did you come here? I worked on an authentication job. So I waited for you to finish work. Since elementary school, nobody came to look for me after school or work hours. I stopped by to wait for you. Not that I'm looking for you after work. It's a boy's job to look for his girlfriend after work. Noted. Chiang-wei. Teacher Si-te. Is Hsiao Tieh getting better? It seems like it. -Really? His fever went down? -Yeah. I think so. Are you free now? You can go with me. He said he wants chicken soup. I don't know the restaurant. -Sure. I'll go with you. -All right. Go home. We'll buy some soup. -All right. Bye. -Bye. She said boys usually wait for girls. How about waiting for her? Since they are most likely carrying heavy stuff. All right. Shall I send her a text message? When she comes back and sees me waiting, she'll be happy. Forget it. It's been 60 minutes. Shall I wait at home? No way. I would have wasted the 60-minute wait. I wait for the traffic light and the sunny weather. But I don't wait for anyone. Wang Chiang-wei. You made me wait. Because I knew you will come around. Wang Chiang-wei. Chiang-ta? Are you waiting for me? Yes, I'm waiting for you. I've been waiting for 98 minutes. What took you so long to buy dinner? Where's Si-te? You waited for 98 minutes? Yeah. Teacher Si-te can't come, she has something to do. There was a long line. I didn't make you wait. I don't like waiting for others. I don't like it when I'm hungry. But I was starving and waiting for you. You don't look hungry though. Is your stomach full of angry gas? Mr. Glutton. Acting cute at this moment? You knew I don't like waiting for others. But you made me wait for a long time. Because I'm not anybody else. I'm Tao Le-ssu plus Wang Chiang-wei. -Tao plus Wang? -Yeah. And Dark Queen. Had it been Dark Queen, I would wait this long. You know that? No way. You can only wait for me. Let me ask you. The probability to run into Dark Queen? Stop calculating. I know who Dark Queen is. Of course you know her. W Queen. You bad lion. You knew it. But you faked your innocence. Am I a bad lion? Who visited Lightless Restaurant and never revisited again? I visited 23 times in half a year. That's suffering, you know? You visited 23 times? That's right. Close your eyes. The kiss of Tao Le-ssu. The kiss of Chiang-wei. The kiss of Dark Queen. Tell me then. For tonight, the probability of Wang Chiang-ta kissing Wang Chiang-wei. 100 percent. Hsiao Tieh. Hsiao Tieh, are you home? We've bought you food. Seems like he's out. He didn't answer my call. How about I try to contact him? His cell phone is turned off. Why is he so strange today? He didn't reply to my message. Did he suffer a setback? What setback? He confessed to me earlier today. And? And I rejected him. Well. What do you mean? Do you want me to accept him? No. I know where he is. One-on-one game. Are you guarding against me? Are you hungry and weak? Come on. One more round. Hsiao Tieh. You know what? If you are too tall, it affects your basketball skills. You're talking about basketball with me? You have poor conversational skills. Don't you have something else to talk about? I defeated you just now. We were brothers since tenth grade, right? That's right. Time passes by swiftly. Have I told you this? I admire you. You did well in school. You're gifted in mathematics. Unlike me. I was fooling around. I was playing basketball. Skipping exams. And wooing girls. But when I became friends with you, you changed me. You let me know that we must set a goal in life. We must achieve something. I didn't expect you to talk about this. You only believe in the truth, you stand by what is right. I quite admire you. Back then, I decided to learn from you. I wanted to be as strong as you are. I told myself this. If I fight for social justice upon graduation would be a good choice. I then sat for the legal exam and became a prosecutor. That's better than working as a lawyer. I wouldn't have known that if you didn't tell me. You haven't been in the know for many matters. You knew my relationship with my family. Upon graduation, I didn't want to stay with my family. I wanted to stay with you. We once went to the night market for beef soup. You didn't pay. I paid for you. You didn't pay. The point is, I enjoy staying with you. I spent one-third of my life with you. You are a close buddy in my life. Tieh Pu-fan. All this time, I've been alone. I see you as my most important friend. Just like you said, I don't know how to talk to others. But I mean it. All right. I wish that there wouldn't be secrets between us. Nothing should affect our friendship. Wang Chiang-ta, I treasure your friendship and I don't want to lose it. You know that I like Chiang-wei. I really like her a lot. I know you like her too. I want to hear from you now. All right. Tieh Pu-fan, you know me well. I have been alone for years. I have gotten used to being alone. But one day, someone gave me warmth. The warmth defeated the solitude in my heart. It broke down my psychological wall. As they say, 1,000 people see 1,000 Hamlets. But there is only one Pythagorean theorem. Chiang-wei is my Pythagorean theorem. I'm seriously in love with her. I care for her. I will never surrender her to you. Great. Since you said that, I feel relieved. How about your Dark Queen? I went round and round. Turns out, Wang Chiang-wei is Dark Queen. Wang Chiang-wei is Dark Queen? How is that possible? We met each other when we were little. Her parents were the victims in the Wang Family murder case. My dad was killed while investigating this case. I don't believe in fate. You know that. But when I thought of our situation, the probability is as tiny as that of a miracle. I knew about it. But you said nothing about it. I selfishly thought that I could be with Chiang-wei. But now, I'm glad. I'm happy that you're sharing your romance story to me. Hsiao Tieh, thank you. But I lost my love. Tieh Pu-fan. As a matter of fact, you didn't lose your love, you know? Yours was unrequited love. Your comment is so mean. I'm sad and you are... I tried my best. Would you tell Chiang-wei? That your dad was dragged in their case? I thought it. I'll tell her one day. But not now. Dad's case was still unclear. I want to clear my dad's name. Furthermore, Chiang-wei is ill. I don't want the case to affect her. The link between you two is special. Out of respect for Chiang-wei, I'll respect your decision. Hey. Give me two days. Don't show off intimacy in front of me. My wound is yet to recover. I still feel the pain. It's expected. I defeated the PhD student in love. Don't boast, you kindergartner. Chiang-wei might dump you two days later. Hsiao Tieh, I'm so pitiful. Chiang-wei dumped me. -Hsiao Tieh. Please don't. -Don't worry. My ball. Thank you. Mind to play a game? My friends went home. Would you two join us? -Sure. -I'll wait for you. Defeat them thoroughly. Let's go. Come on. In the world of love, it's a taboo to keep a secret. -Collagen... -Good morning. Good morning, Tieh. Ms. Wang. Please receive your parcel. -My parcel? -Yeah. You weren't home yesterday. I received it on your behalf. Thank you. What is this? Let me open it. It's here. What is it? Collagen? That's right. My aunt ordered it. -Chiang-wei. -Yes? Please tell me if Chiang-ta bullies you. I'll teach him a lesson. He treats me well. I don't think he'll bully me. Well, then. -I'll go to work now. -All right. Call me if you need anything. Bye. What a coincidence. Even the TV program is promoting it. Seems like it's popular now. Big brother, I've discovered the main shareholder of the soy sauce factory. The company is named Hui Teng. Who is the boss of Hui Teng Company? Tell me. I won't make a guess. It's Lien Chong-yen. -Lien Chong-yen? -Yes. You said someone was lobbying the bureau. Through his connections, Lien Chong-yen was trying to halt the investigation? That's right, big brother. Isn't the case getting clearer now? I didn't expect that it involved my dad. Lien Chong-yen was trying to force her daughter. And he used dirty tactics. He asked someone to lobby. This is not surprising. It's weird though. The cases that I'm handling recently are related to Lien Chong-yen. Do your work according to evidence. Regardless of who the suspects are. The lab test is out. The soy sauce plant used industrial coloring. First, contact the health department. Check their accounting records at their office tomorrow morning. Yes, big brother. I'm doomed. What's the matter? I'm worried. I knew these rich people. What if they offer a higher price for me to buy back? Someone said he wants to apologize to Chiang-wei and wants me to mediate two sides. You said it nicely. You are now about to let go of your ill-gotten gains. And you're saying no. Old Yen, think twice before asking for my help. -I'm leaving. -Chiang-ta, please stay. Sorry. All right. I'll give in. Don't tell me that. You tell the seller. Chiang-ta, you're very smart. Mr. Chong could be buying art pieces stealthily. His wife found out and forced him to sell the paperweight. When the couple appeared, I found Mr. Chong to be eager to sell it off. Also, his attitude is clear. As for other matters, I'm 40 percent certain. 40 percent? How about making a guess? You may guess. You'll still pay if I make a wrong guess. -I don't know. -Sigh. You're... What should I do next? LION WANG CHANG-TA Hello? Chiang-wei is here. Please come in. Chiang-ta. Open it up. FISHES LEAPING DRAGON GATE Also, please take a look. Ancient lion paperweight. Hasn't this... Hasn't this been auctioned? I bought them back. All thanks to Chiang-ta. The total price shot up more than NTD 100,000. But it's worth it. This is what I need to do. Chiang-wei, I'm in no position to be forgiven. But I can now return the stuff to its original owner to show that I sincerely want to turn a new leaf. I will do good deeds to repent my sins. And now, please receive these two items. All right? Agreed. You agreed? She agreed. That's great. That's great. She agreed. -Chiang-wei. That's great. -Hey. That's great. That's great. I remember the ancient lion paperweight comes in one pair. Where is the other one? It would be great if I let them reunite. But it's difficult to get one back. Am I too greedy? Hello. You're just next door. You may see me in the living room. Why the video call? We live so near to each other. Distance makes the heart grows fonder. All right. I knew it isn't easy to persuade stingy Old Yen. Thanks for your effort. For stingy Sherlock to persuade stingy Old Yen, it's very simple. The point is, the paperweight is important for you. So long as you are happy, I'm willing to do anything. I'm glad. Great. Good night then. -Good night. -Hang on. How about our nicknames? I'll call you Chiang-wei. You call me Chiang-ta. Simple as that. All right? You boring person. That's not special. I have decided to call you Big Meow. You would call me Hsiao Wei. My big cat? Hsiao Wei? A childhood name from my parents. Great. Good night, my big cat. Good night, Hsiao Wei. I thought distance is good? I want to share a secret... Let me tell you. What is it? Good night. Good night. Why is trouble popping up when I'm running for the election? Something is wrong with the soy sauce plant control. Go and check it out. Who is the whistle-blower? Tieh Pu-fan. What about Tieh Pu-fan? Doesn't he have a superior? Did I give a bribe to no avail? Let me tell you. Money solves all problems. Help me bribe through it. Not again. It's you again. What do you want, Kuan Ching-ching? Turn on your video call. Let me show you something. It looks nice. You're a girl. Can you behave yourself? I'm not talking about porn. What are you thinking about? If you are uninterested after seeing it, I promise not to disturb you anymore. Sure. I'll hold your word for it. Hello. -Can you see me? -Yes, I do. Anything for me to see? Something behind me. This piece. I stole it from Lien Chong-yen's auction. And this piece was stolen from Lien's warehouse. Give way. I want to see them clearly. I knew you are interested in them. Do you regret treating me badly? Treat me better and you will see the whole piece. I'm taking the trouble to phone you. All right. You asked why I stole this piece from the auction, right? I heard that Lien Chong-yen had precious collections. I then went to his warehouse to steal this piece. I wrapped it tightly. It was one-third of the whole piece. I stole the other two-thirds from the auction. Don't you find it interesting? Why did he split an artwork into two pieces? And sold the other piece at the auction? Let me see it clearly. It's never clear through camera. You should see it yourself. But how? 7:00 p.m. tomorrow. Have dinner at my place. We'll play a quiz before I give it to you. Visit your place? Have dinner and a quiz? Come on. It's either you give or sell it to me. Or let me take a look. All right? Don't worry. I know you have a girlfriend now. It's just dinner. We won't do anything else. Just inform her. Tell her and she won't be jealous. I'll send you an address later. -That's all. Bye. -Hey... Wang Chiang-ta. Who are you indeed? BASIC NUMBER THEORY "1994 Ming Guang Road." Wang Family. "Policeman Wang, suspected." No wonder. Chiang-ta. Thanks for making your time to attend the math conference. The theme was tough. Luckily you responded. Or else, we'll be embarrassed. In fact, I found such conferences to be interesting. Really? Thank you for opening my heart. So long as I can make you smile. Shall I tell her about my dad's role in the case? I must handle the case impartially. Chiang-ta didn't come home last night. Is it related to this? All evidence points to your disadvantage. You're a suspect now. Subtitle translation by BK Yeow
