 On a day like this I get to thinking I'm in the wrong line of work. I should've been a lifeguard. Look at it this way, Ponch. We're out here doing our thing on these hot streets and blistering freeways. We are lifeguards, huh? Gee, Jon, I feel better already, you know? - Oh, man, I'm sorry. Here. - Sorry, sorry. 'LAPD reports a possible 211 suspect.' 'Male Caucasian, last seen on a red motorcycle.'

 'Eastbound on Seaside at 9th Street.' Let's check him out. LA-15, 7 Mary-3 in pursuit of 211 suspect east on 9th Street. '10-4, 7 Mary-3.' 'Stay with him!' Excuse me. You alright? I, uh, I don't know. I think so. See what that dumb nerd did? Yeah, we saw. Why? Why did he do that? My partner and I were chasing him. I guess he figured we'd both stop if there was an accident. Come on, let me help you up.

 Ow! What's the matter? My legs. They feel funny. Kinda numb. LA-15, 7 Mary-4. Roll an ambulance at Seaside and 12th. Motorcycle versus Bicycle. 11-81. '10-4, Mary-4.' 'Be advised Mary-3 terminated pursuit' 'at Santa Monica pier.' 10-4. Hey, I thought I asked you not to try to get up, remember? I'll get up if I want to. What about my bike? I'll have it delivered to your front door. Now relax. I've got an ambulance on the way. Wait a minute. That's your partner? Yeah. Name of Jon Baker. Ugly rascal, isn't he? Meet Kelly Adams. Wanna bring her up to date? Yeah, Kelly, look I'm afraid the news isn't very good. He got away, didn't he? Is that what you're gonna tell me? Well, what happened was-- 'I don't care what happened.' He got away and I don't ever wanna see you guys again! You better get going. Hi, Ponch. Hey, Timmy, how you doing? Great. I'm going to the gym to do my exercises. Hey, good for you. - See ya later. - Alright. Well, hello. Tell me, Lori, when you gonna give up this wild, fast life settle down, and marry me? When you give up your other 20 girlfriends. Ooh, decisions, decisions. Is this visit business or pleasure? A little of both. I'd like to go over the program with you for Saturday See if we forgot anything. You got time? Got about 10 minutes. Good. Lori, the girl at the table out there with the people is that Kelly Adams? Mm-hmm. She a friend of yours? Jon and I saw her get hurt. How's she doing? She just checked in yesterday. We're still making tests. Her accident happened 3 weeks ago. - Paralysis. She wasn't responding to treatment at the other hospital so they sent her over here for physical therapy. Be alright if I say hello? Sure. It's her mother and father by the way. - Thanks. Be right back. - Okay. - Hi, Ponch. - Hi, Susie. How goes the battle? - I'm going home tomorrow. - Great. But I'm still going to the picnic. Good. I'll see you there. Bye. 'Bye.' Well, if it ain't the fuzz. Did you make your quota of tickets for today? How many times I gotta tell ya, T.C.? - So I forgot. Hey, Ponch, did anyone ever steal your motorcycle? Heh. No. Be funny if someone did, huh? No. You fuzz ain't got no sense of humor. Ha-ha. Hi. Hi. I'm Officer Poncherello. You're the officer who helped Kelly. He didn't help me. - Honey, please. - Well, he didn't. How you doing, sweetheart? She's doing fine, just fine. The doctors say if she does her exercises she'll be going home in no time at all. Doctors are a bunch of liars just like at the other hospital. Baby, I wish you wouldn't talk like that. Did you ever catch that nerd? No, but we will. Sure you will. Just like the doctors will have me walking again. Go away, will you? Um, I'm sorry. Not your fault. Thanks for stopping by. We do appreciate your concern. Sure. Hey, Ponch. I just made a bet with my buddy here that you wouldn't do it. Do what? Race me. 'What kind of race?' In these. You won the bet. See, I told you he was chicken. Chicken? Okay, when I say go, you must circle each column once then you race back to here. Ready.. ...get set.. ...go! Go, T.C! T.C., go! Don't shove it so hard. Smooth and easy does it. Thanks a lot. Go. Go, T.C. 'T.C., go.' 'Come on, T.C.' 'T.C., come on. Alright.' 'Come on, T.C.' Nice going, Ponch. Yeah, once more around, I would've had her. Sure you would. Listen, I gotta get back to work. I'll see you Saturday. You tell T.C. I wanna rematch. Anytime. Got one. Right on. Get lost, will ya? Peggy's no problem. Right, baby? For sure. I could care less what you guys do. About everything? Most everything. Here's the address. 'How long will it take to do the job?' If I don't run into any trouble, about 20 minutes. Trouble? What kind of trouble? Who knows? Cops. A pretty girl. You'd better not. 'Don't kid around, will ya, Chuck?' Sorry. I gotta get back to work. You about finished? Relax, will ya, Danny? - Easy for you to say. - 'And do.' Chuck's Mr. Cool, and that's for sure. Only way to fly. Finis. 'Be sure to pick me up at the pier.' And, uh, stay loose, okay? - All the time. Being brothers, you sure are different. In what way? Well, you're such a take-charge kinda dude and Danny, he's always four steps behind you. It works. Hey, how would you like to take a ride in a set of wheels like that? 'Crazy.' But how are you gonna make that happen? Hmm, I got my ways and means. I gotta go. One last item, which should interest Baker, Poncherello, and Turner in particular 'concerning the Marina Del Rey area.' Don't tell us. String bikinis have been outlawed. Aha. Well, if you're thinking of wearing one, Grossman I'd suggest rope, not string. Yeah, see? Hey! In the last few weeks thieves have been hitting the Marina pretty heavily. But we think we know how this is being done. Tell us about it, sarge. We're all ears. Well, that's a good way to be, Baricza. More ears, less mouth. This is how it's being done. The thief or thieves use stolen motorcycles leaving them somewhere after the robberies. They hit condos, never homes. 'This way, they can easily be mistaken for tenants.' 'Now, there's never any sign of forced entry.' 'The owners in every instance say' 'that the condos were securely locked.' Also, the thieves know just when to make their hits. The owners or their hired help are never on the premises. 'These crooks know good stuff when they see it.' 'Quality loot is all they ever take.' 'That plus cash.' 'Small, expensive items that are easy to carry' 'easy to fence.' 'After one thief rips off a house' 'his partner waits for him at a given point' 'and they flee from that point in another vehicle.' A week or so ago, as you all know Baker and Poncherello were aced out of a capture when the crooks used a boat to make their escape. LAPD come up with anything? Negative. No broken windows, jimmied doors no fingerprints. In other words, duplicate keys. Yeah, but how would they get one? That's a good question. Right now, we're working on an answer. Okay, let's get out among 'em. - Yeah. Ohh. You see that, Jon? Just like I tell you. She's always throwing herself at me. Ahh, dreamer. I need to talk to you guys. I'm in charge of the food and stuff for the picnic. Now hold on. Let me see, Evans, ice cream, check. Donner, cake, check. Cowen, hot dogs, check. Here you are. Poncherello, baked beans. Did you get the baked beans? Yeah. I-I got a whole bunch of it. Good. Uh, Poncherello, baked beans, check. Jon, I've got you down for paper plates and napkins. Yeah, yeah. I got enough to feed a small army. Great. Hmm. That takes care of that. Now all I have to do is make sure that Sergeant Getraer got the balloons, and I'm all finished. You're doing a fine job, Bonnie. Keep up the good work. I will. Did you guys get that stuff? - Yeah, sure. - We got a whole bunch of it. We got it all. Catch ya later, alright? - Bye-bye. - See ya. Remind me to get some baked beans, will ya? Yeah, at the same time, you remind me to get the paper plates. Yeah. Did you hear what she made Getraer get? Balloons. Balloons! Whoo-hoo. Cassie, good shot. That puts your team ahead. - Oh, I am. Here you go. Good luck. Whoa ho ho.. Good. Yeah, right. What I got? I gotta have baked here. Beans for you? Huh? There we go. There we are. Don't you worry. There's plenty more. So you come back, huh? Sarge, you put enough food on that plate to feed a baseball team. Nonsense. He's a growing boy. He eats all that, he'll grow, alright. About six feet wide. Huh. Yeah. Yay. - Yay. - Alright. - Over a hundred. But we never really wanna go that fast. Better to put up roadblocks. Stop a criminal that way. You got it! 'The guy's pretty smart.' Your wrist is too stiff. Cool it, T.C. I know how to shoot basketball. Like I said, your wrist is too stiff. Alright, expert, show me. Loose wrist does it every time. I'll be right back, T.C., okay? Okay. Hi. Having fun? No, I'm not. Well, why not? I didn't wanna come to this stupid thing. They made me. So why don't you make the most of it, huh? Because I don't want to, that's why. 'Why don't you go away? Just leave me alone.' Hey, what is it with you, anyway? You don't like doctors, you don't like cops. You think we're all a bunch of liars or something. Because doctors are liars. Telling me I'd get better. Walk again if I did my exercises. Well, I did them! Did everything they told me. I tried. Tried as hard as I could. And nothing happened. Nothing. Maybe you gave up too soon. That's what they said. But when I asked them when I would walk they couldn't tell me. You know, it's not easy to give an answer to injuries like yours. I know the answer. Never! I'll never walk again. Bunch of liars. Tell me, have you caught that guy yet 'like you said you would?' - No, but-- - Yeah, you will. I know. I've heard it before. This is alright, huh? Yeah. Out of sight. Tell me, lover, where'd you get this beautiful set of wheels? Would you believe in a box of cracker jacks? If you say so. Hey, move it over here, doll. Nice little kiddie car you got there, fella. Don't forget to wind the rubber bands. Okay, hang on, kids. That's good. Take care of the kids, would ya? Come on, Bear, let's go. Saw a felony suspect. What are they doing? Giving a demonstration? No, honey. I think it's the real thing. 'There he is.' Okay, let's take him. Damn. - Yeah, believe it. Hang on. What are you trying to do, get us killed? Just stop the car, okay, Chuck? Baby, that's 5 years in jail chasing me. Then just let me out, please? Hey, chick, you want out, jump. Now we lose them. Aah! - 'I think so.' I think my seat belt saved me. Okay. Don't try to move. Understand? We'll have you out of there as soon as we can. Better play it safe. Call an ambulance. Yeah, right. I don't understand. It happened so fast. Yes, sir. It usually does. Relax in there, okay? Hey, how you doing? Well, did you miss me? Hey, I'll ask the questions. Where you guys been? What was that all about? Remember the clown that ran off the pier? Yeah, I remember. Just tell me one thing. Did you get him, I hope? Uh, no. 'This time the guy nearly killed somebody, too.' I have the hospital report. That guy's just shaken up. A few bumps and bruises, that's all. First the Adams girl, and now this. Nice class of crooks you guys hang out with. Hey, just so we get better acquainted, that's all. I checked on what you said at briefing, about duplicate keys. Only the owners and the janitor have duplicate keys. And the janitor's been there six years and doesn't have a record. That's no help. 'I found out one more thing when I questioned the owners.' Their places were all ripped off while they were out to lunch. - People gotta eat. - Yeah, true. But they were all eating at the same restaurant. Good evening, sir. Will you gentlemen be staying for dinner? That's our plan unless you've run out of T-bone steaks. There's no danger of that happening. Enjoy your meal. Hey, treat her gently, would ya? It's all I own. Good thinking. If that guy's ripping off apartments I hope he leaves mine alone. You recognize him? He looks like that guy that was driving the boat But I couldn't swear to it. The other one though, I'd recognize if I saw him. We're dealing with thieves who plan ahead which means the other guy probably never shows his face around here. Oh, no, no, now, don't be so sure. I got a plan. You wanna listen to it? It was a great notion, Baker. When I told it to the captain, he thought it was great only we can't do it. Why not? Because it smacks of entrapment. What do we do? Wait until the guy kills somebody in their own apartment? Sometimes it's a good idea to throw the book away. The captain knows that, too. Well, then what's the problem? Money's the problem. About $100,000's worth. The department won't put up or be responsible for that kind of loot. Hey, if that's all that's bothering the captain tell him not to worry. We'll take care of that department. ' - We'll take care of it. Yeah. It's another one of our great ideas. Oh, I gotta see that one. 'Okay, now, let me understand this.' You want the use of my place for one afternoon this week, right? Right. I'll tell you when. - I can't. - It's police business. - Oh. I'll take full responsibility. Okay. Well, try not to get anything on the rug, okay? 'Cause I just got it cleaned. Yeah, okay. Okay. You know, Jon, I'm always happy to help you fellas out. What is it this time, huh? Policemen's benefit? Whatever. Put me down for a dozen tickets. Not this time, Mr. Dawson, but thanks anyway. Well, what is it? Well, I'd just like to borrow something you have just for an afternoon. Borrow? Yeah. Why, sure. No problem. You've got it. What do you need, huh? That. 'Sure I remember when the Rivas gang jumped me.' And who pulled them off you? Well, you did. After they busted my nose. 'Better late than never.' So, I owe you? What do you want? Oh, just the loan of a couple of things for an afternoon. Like what? Like, uh.. This and uh.. ...this and a couple of these. Those little things add up to about $50,000. Yeah, that should do. What happened here? You send all your patients home? Oh, I wish I could. Most of them are downstairs watching a movie. Well, I see Kelly Adams is with them. No, she isn't. We transferred her to a private room down at the end of the hall. - 'Her attitude.' We thought it best for the rest of the patients for a while, anyway. She's not doing too good, is she? - 'No. We're worried about her.' She has to exercise those leg muscles at least 3 times a day. She flatly refuses to do any of it. What could happen to her? She could spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair. - 'That bad.' Could I see her for a minute? Go ahead. But don't be surprised if she gives you a hard time. Won't be any different than any other time. Thanks. Hi, Ponch. Hey, buddy, how come you're not at the movies? I'd rather read a book. Good for you. Besides, I've seen the picture five times already. Get out of here! Hey, uh, let me give you a hand first. No. Just get out of here, will you? Okay. I'll get the nurse. No! I don't need her help. Don't need anyone's help. Show me. Get back in bed, and I'll leave. I can't. Me or the nurse? You, I guess. There. So you did your good deed for the day. Now close the door behind you. Heard you gave up. Won't try to get better. So what? Hey, what I saw just now didn't look like a quitter to me. Looked like a real gutsy gal. What did you come here for, anyway? To tell you we're gonna get the guy who did this to you. 'No, you won't. You'll never get him.' We will, and that's a promise, Kelly. If I wanted something real bad and maybe just maybe, somebody could help me with it I wouldn't be so quick to give up on them. I'd give them a second chance. 'It sure can't hurt to try.' Take care, huh? This one is mine. Oh, hi. I hope you don't mind that I parked it myself. I really don't like other people driving it. I feel the same way about my van. Do you work here all the time? Nope. Just helping a buddy out for today. Oh, yeah. I just moved into the Marina. I hear it's a swinging place. That's what they tell me. Oh. Thank you. It's so loose. I have to remember to get this thing fixed. Yeah. You don't wanna lose it. A ring like that must cost plenty of loot. You know good jewelry when you see it. It's a hobby of mine. You must have a generous husband. 'A generous ex-husband.' I live alone now. Time to spend a boring hour with a very dull girlfriend. Sorry 'bout that. Thank you for helping me. Anytime. I'll remember that. You said we were gonna cool it for a while. This is too sweet a deal to pass up. That chick is loaded. Chuck, I'm scared. I'm really scared. Now, we got enough to last for a while. Let's back off. I've gotta feeling that this is gonna be fat city for us. 'I mean fat city.' You always say that. This time for sure. And after we'll have enough loot you're gonna go back to college get that degree that mom and dad always wanted you to have. You mean it? This is the last one for sure? If I say it, I mean it. 'Now, go on back to work.' Okay. And, Danny, relax. We've got it made. Sure. Fat city. Wonder how Bonnie's doing? We'll know soon enough. Think this jug will be fooled by the fake jewelry planted in the apartment? All we have to worry about is that he shows up. Mr. Dawson wants his car back today. Yeah, Galagos is going bananas. Bonnie might get mugged with his real jewelry on her. We did kind of bend the rules a little, didn't we? Yeah, you might say that. Just hope it pays off, huh? 63-Adam, how do you read? Loud and clear, Mary-4. Be alert. He's on his way in. 10-4. Suspect has entered the apartment. 10-23. Don't move on him. Just let us know when he comes out. - '10-4.' - It's going down. I hope Nancy's home. Well, it's her day off. She should be. Uh, ma'am. No! Hey, whatever it is, we're innocent. Yeah. Young, sweet, and innocent. 'No!' He broke a window, Mary-4. Check the alley. LA-15, Mary-3 and 4 in pursuit of suspect southbound on Indio from Marina Way. Suspect riding a red motorcycle. 00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:23,279 10-4, Mary-3. He's heading for the pier. Let's do it. Good to see you, old buddy. Good to see you, old buddy. You were right about one thing, pal. This is our last time. - Anytime you are. Are you sure you wouldn't like a head start? Are you kidding? This race is in the bag. Make up your mind. Are we gonna talk or race? Alright, I'm ready. Let's do it. Okay, on your marks get set.. ...go! Looks so easy when the kids do it, doesn't it? Did you see that? She cut me off at the pass. You just won't learn, will you? You watch. I'll get her next time. Where have I heard that before? Hey, you wanna know a secret? 'You're looking good.' Thanks. I'm getting there. I'm going home tomorrow. Hey, no kidding, that's great. You know, you're gonna make a lot of people very proud of you. The best part is Dr. Bern says I'll be able to throw away my crutches in a couple of weeks. Alright, that's great. Fantastic. And you know something? I believe him.
