 How'd you get into off Back home? The wide-open spaces of Wyoming, I guess. Out here it was Harlan. Pure, clean desert air. You're gonna love it. Sure. All that rough driving? Ponch, that's the challenge. That's the fight. The terrain and the clock. Try to survive the course and get the best time you can get. Hey, you're gonna love it. Hey, it gets me out of town for three days.

 That I love. Hey. You okay, sarge? Yeah. It's just a routine rear-ender with a deuce. Hey, the Mojave Desert's that way if you're lost already. With me as navigator, who could get lost? I hear the price of gold was up again. Your boss is getting richer every day, right? If the gold is still there. Freddy, nobody saw me crash the airplane. Nobody's found the gold, or we'd know it. It's been there three months. Who's gonna take it now

 Uh-oh. Cops up ahead. 'Highway patrol writing tickets.' They got no beef with us. I know. I just want us to get to Funeral Mountain without any attention paid to us. Hey, guys, I got a loose 50 cents. Should I bet you to win? Amateur race, amateur bet. You got it. See you later. Good luck. If either one of you come back with a broken bone I'll break your arm. I don't know, they drive 700 miles a week on-duty. They get three days off and then they wanna come up here and drive 250 miles in an off-road race. At a place called Funeral Mountain yet. How do you figure 'em? Well, that's it. The great outdoors. You recognize it at all? Man, it's dusty here. Well, you don't wear a white silk suit. I mean, when the wind comes up, it gets worse. Any other tips, old timer? Yeah. Don't pick up any scorpions. Man, I'm gonna love it here, huh? I'm gonna check on the tech inspection, alright? Hiya, class three. You okay? I'm fine, but only three? I thought I'd rate at least a six maybe a seven. Uh-oh. First It's that obvious? You don't know what class you race in your truck's too clean and you're too clean. Uh, yeah, I'm a beginner. I'm innocent, I'm inexperienced and I'm Ponch. Hi. Save your energy, sailor. You must have work to do. Me? No. I'm free the rest of the day. Well, we're not, we have to register we have to fix her transmission, re-weld my frame and get a tech inspection. Hmm. Friends of yours? No. Just discussing frames and transmissions. About ready for our tech inspection. Alright, gentlemen.. Harlan? You didn't tell me he was officiating. Team of Baker and Poncherello. Entering class three. Stock 4x4, huh? Alright. Is this your first race? Harlan, you know it is. As a friend, I know that. As an official, I'm asking. Five-point harness system, good. Hey, I think I know those two guys. Oh, yeah. The guys the cops were ticketing on the freeway. Oh, yeah, yeah. The blue truck. Your shock absorbers.. Were they done by a certified master mechanic? Oh, yeah, yeah. You. It's a good job. We got tools, spare tires and plenty of spare parts. Alright, you pass. Your number's 24. 'Now, you attach this can to your vehicle.' An official will drop a marker in it at each checkpoint. We're in the race, Ponch. Against stuff like that? 'No, no. That's a class above us.' 'That's modified class two.' 'They tear it down and rebuild it.' They got about 60,000 into that thing. Well, I didn't think this was a rich man's hobby. It's good enough for us. You know.. Now that I'm out here again.. ...I think I should get more money for the chance I took. Setting down a sick airplane in a restricted area where nobody ever goes. I told you before, you should've stretched it out to Bakersfield. Oh, yeah. Wouldn't that be somethin'? I try to make Bakersfield, I crash into the middle of town. I can just hear the Chamber Of Commerce now. Come see our city streets paved with a half a million in syndicate gold. Comical. Boss would get a belly laugh. Oh, yeah. Laugh his head off if I died out there. Like they think I did. You know, you could've packed that gold all on your back and been long gone. Uh-huh. So I'm dumb. Or I'm honest. Or my knee was so busted up I couldn't carry 200 pounds of anything. You know, the funny thing is you're dead. I mean, according to everybody else. I could knock you off out there and just leave you. Then you wouldn't get paid nothin'. You don't know where the plane is. I didn't until I saw the map. Now I just get off the race track at the arrow go where you ditched the plane and the gold in that circle. - Yeah. Oh, unless.. Unless I made phony markings to protect myself with. The course is clearly marked with lime and flags and we know it's safe, but remember Fort Todd has been a bombing and artillery range since 1917. There are some unexploded shells out there. 'So stay on the course.' I'm gonna love it here, right? Take over, Harlan. You have some absolutely horrible real estate here, captain. That's the way we like it! Now, we just have a few association rules.. Hey, you got any entries left? I feel like a race! Andy Stomer. Is he racing here? You know him? Supersport? No, but everybody else does. Made a fortune last year jumping that river. What's he doing racing an amateur race? I mean, there's no money. Just trophies. This is the little baby that beams us right in on the gold. Don, the night you crashed the plane and hiked out.. - Yeah. - Nope. Nobody here would know who you are, right? Right. Man, they looked for me for a month. I shaved the beard. I dyed the hair. I lost 20 pounds. My mother wouldn't know me. What's the problem? Oh, I don't know. And who is this guy Supersport Stomer? And that official Harlan? He's with the motor maintenance department of the CHP I know. And he knows those two guys in the blue truck. 'I just got the feeling that somebody knows why we're here.' Fred, your boss is the only one who knew we were gonna wait for the race and get in here with the racers. If anybody knows we're here for the gold they got it from his big mouth. Aye, you talkin' about first-timers. You haven't even tried Ponch's chili. We're off-roaders. We take chances. Oh, yeah? You're lucky the Wyoming kid's not cooking. He wanted to do his specialty. Fried rattlesnake. Ponch says you raced in Wyoming, Jon. I hear it's great. Yeah, well, California desert's a lot bigger challenge rougher and more mysterious. Right. It takes a special person. - Mm-hmm. You know, they say that guy will bet any amount do anything to win. Supersport? Don't worry. He's not in the same class with you. I know. Doesn't race in the same class, either. That's what I meant, but you can take it both ways. You know those guys over there? No. New on the circuit, I guess. Why? Well, they've been eyeballing Jon and me all day long. Uh, chili's ready. Well, let's eat. Did you talk to them? No. I checked out the jeep. Who are they? Do you know? The one with the limp is a pilot. The big guy is Fred Larson what's known in the underworld as a mechanic. Professional killer. What? Andy, what is this? A challenge. A contest. 'Just part of the game, baby.' But if those guys get in my way I'll break their backs, and pound 'em into the ground. Alright, uh, good luck to both of you. - Thanks. - Thank you. Hey, beautiful rig. Well, I'm not in your class. Good luck. He doesn't act like a cop. Good undercover cops never do. Hey, Supersport. I'm Frank Poncherello. My partner Jon Baker. We're great followers of your career, you know? - I'm Mrs. Stomer. - Beth. - Come on. Uh, wait a minute, I think the idea here was to say good luck. The idea here is to get some free advice. Okay, I'll give you some. Stay out of my way. You, too. Andy's always like this before an event. You didn't say thank you, Jon. I'll write him a note. Get in. Andy, why did you do that? They're nothing to you. I want to see what they'd do. Let's go, huh? Good time to start. Just enough cars in front of us to cut the course and not too many to chew it up. Just spoke to the guys in that fancy jeep. They've even got a direction finder. They're either gung-ho or goofy. We're not racing them, we're racing the clock. Class two drivers, to your cars. Class two competition will start in two minutes. Hey, look at Supersport. Direction finder. I knew it! I knew it! There's been a leak. He knows! I thought for once, we might come out just to race. We did, baby. For half a million dollars in gold coins. I don't know about your so-called cops but Mr. Stomer is here for the gold. And he's playing show and tell. Come on, don't be a fool, Fred. He wants to play, let's play. We'll lose our start. Let's go. How's that finder gonna help us? The tone is from the airway beacon on Funeral Mountain. When I started losing power, I flew in on that beacon. We get in the reverse course now and drive straight to where I crash landed. So Stomer can do the same thing! No! He doesn't know what course we were flying. He's using his a different way. - To follow us! He probably planted a bug someplace in this jeep. Keep going! Let him follow! Let him follow us clear off the race course. Then we off him with nobody peeking. How come I gotta think of all the plans? You're the crook! Try the DF. It's working. I make it 30 miles to the checkpoint. After we pass in Arroyo go through silt two sinks, and a tank. Pure, clean desert air, huh? We'll get rid of the dust in the tank. What's a tank? It's where the last water stands in a dry creek bed. Yeah, well, sounds like a swamp. Heh, a small one. Terrific. Gotta get rid of those cops! Fred, you just think they're cops! Okay, Stomer got wise to this. Cops might be wise but they'd be Feds, not CHP! So, maybe they're Feds! - Get outta my way! - Watch out! You alright? Lousy jeep forced me right off the trail. Yeah? Well, join the club. Couple of dangerous dudes. Broken axle. Hey, you okay? Yeah. But now I'm riding with you. Listen, if you give us a hand we won't have to call for help and be disqualified. Jon, it's a race. There's rules. Every man for himself. Make that every person. And let me get my hands on the person that ran me off the course. Okay, baby, back it up! 'Back it!' Hold it! Hold it! You'll tear something loose. 'Wait a minute.' Let's go check on Supersport. Looks like he's stuck, too. Your truck okay? Yeah, peachy keen. It's just resting. We might as well give each other a hand. We got some free advice. Stay out of your way. Hey, come on. I was just putting you guys on. Now, look, you need a winch to get back on the course. I've got one. But I'm hung up on that log over there. 'Car 43 to race central.' 'Off the course at marker 94.' 'Just a blown engine. No driver injury. Go.' 'That's a roger on that. We'll pick him up.' Over and out. Take care of that, will you? - 'Hi.' ' Here's Harlan! Hey, you're too soon. The early finishers won't be coming in until about 3 o'clock. Well, we thought it'd take at least that long to chill the champagne. Hey, hey, hey! How they doing? You mean the team of Baker and Poncherello? Who else? I haven't heard. Okay, back it up easy! 'The log will give way. Go ahead.' I know Andy let you do all the work. It's hard to explain his compulsion. I feel as if I'm always apologizing for him. Then he ought to stop. Or maybe somebody needs to straighten him out. Beth, get in the truck. Get in the truck, I said, or I'll leave without you. Hey, uh, wait a minute. What about the truck and the winch? That does nothing to help me win, friend. Come on, get in! Hey, wait a minute! - Wait a minute! - Hey! Hold it, man! The guy said he had a winch. He didn't say he was gonna use it. You been in the sun too long? I mean, this isn't even funny. Hey, Jon, he was gonna leave us anyhow. This way, he'll have a surprise. He sprung a leak. He's losing engine coolant. 'Uh' Yeah, I guess you're right. Ha ha! You said I'd love it here. Well, I love it. Time limit's what worries me. If we don't finish this race by 6 o'clock the finish doesn't count. Hey, listen, we only lost 15 minutes. Not too much if we can get this thing to back up. Okay, I'll try to guide you out. Alright. Ready? Alright. Oh, easy. Okay, you got it. Okay, go on. Take it back. Hey, stop! What's the matter, man? Get on the radio. Call 'em about 100 yards from marker 125. There's an unexploded bombshell. - Go on, take a look. - You just missed it. - I don't want to look. Here, you, you tell 'em. Lift the pins. Yeah, I will. The coolant line is loose. Tell me about the gold. Okay, sweetheart, I'll tell you about it. The Syndicate launders some profits down in South America and then turns them into gold coins and ships them back here by airplane. One of the planes disappeared about three months ago. Disappeared - Oh. Here. - Yeah. A guy by the name of Fred Larson was paid to recover the gold. Where he goes, I go. Andy, I don't like you involving yourself in organized crime. Sweetheart, I am not involved. But as you know, I love the game and I bet high stakes. Now, listen, I met a couple of guys I gave them some money for some information about Larson and the gold. We don't need the money, Andy. Don't you understand? It's not the money, it's the game. What about those two guys who helped us whom you left out there? What if they die out there? Is that part of the game? Let's go. In the truck. Andy, I am afraid for you. This won't satisfy you. Nothing has in the years since we've been together. Please, honey, give it up. No! Now knock off the feminine slop. Now, baby, I told you before nothing's gonna stop me. Not this truck, not you, and not the desert. Now let's go. I'm leaving. - No! we leave the race course pretty soon. Lost sight of Supersport, so slow down. We're going so slow now everybody's passing us. Slow down. Let him catch up. Look, maybe we lost him for good. Now would be the time to pull over, stop check for that bug, find it, and get rid of it. Stomer, man. Lead him off the course and get rid of him. I don't know, I don't know about wiping somebody out without orders. Hey, who made this a life or death one 'Stomer.' Tell your beloved boss the truth. You did it in self-defense. I'm not too crazy about this. Hey, those turkeys put my bike out of action. And us riding double put you out of the race. Hey, did you see me fake that fall? Yeah! We gotta get them, Don. They got the DF, the charts, the map, everything. Wait, wait. Wait. Let me think. Let me think. Think what? It'll take a little longer, but I can find the gold. And we can work our way out of here like I did before. We don't finish this race, they're gonna start a search. That's at least three hours. We'll be long gone by then. Your cops are out of this. And if Stomer bugged the jeep he'll follow it to the finish line. The girls have got our jeep. Forget about the girls. They don't know what this is all about. Come on. Let's get out of here. - Treasure. - Treasure. - Treasure! Look, these guys are after treasure. 'A pilot's license, Don Mesker' 'a newspaper article about him disappearing, and a map.' And right here, dollar signs. Nattie, maybe the treasure's why they have the DF. You know, those guys in the jeep they did that to us on purpose, Jon. Ahh. Maybe they thought we were somebody that they knew, somebody else. Yeah, we are someone else. A couple of dummies out here 'driving in an off-road race.' Uh, maybe they found out from Harlan that we're cops, and they hate cops. Hey. ' - I swear I saw somebody. There. Thank you. Thanks. You're both really nice. If that were Syndicate gold Stomer's probably right. Those are Syndicate guys in the jeep. Yeah, we're gonna be too late unless we catch 'em before they leave the course. But don't you understand? I left him. And I don't care about the gold. Beth, are you mad enough to get him killed? - No-- - Well, those guys in the jeep.. I mean, they're gonna set him up and knock him off without even batting an eye. That's right. So let's go. Radio's cutting out. Look, I shouldn't have involved you two. Look, Beth, we're already involved. We're police officers. 'What was that?' 'That was a tank.' Harlan, this is Ponch. Harlan, this is Ponch. You copy? Over. 'Harlan, this is Ponch you copy? Over.' 10-4, Poncherello. Over. Harlan, can you code 33 this? Code 33, that means clear all channels. That's highway patrol brevity, uh, code. Yeah. Uh, 10-4, Poncherello. All drivers, hold the radio channel. Poncherello, you are 10-17. Over. Harlan, 10-17 means relay papers and supplies. Oh, yeah, right. Uh, roger. Uh, uh, uh, 10-22 that, Poncherello. You are a, uh, 10-2, 10-9 over. Is the helicopter 10 Uh, in service. Uh, uh, rog.. uh, 10-4. Uh, that's a negative on that. 'Uh, uh, Air One is-is, uh' 11-78 on to, uh, 11-80. Now that's accident with injuries. On, uh, south loop. Over. We just passed marker flag 276. 'We're chasing some bad guys out here.' We think they're gonna leave the race and head for Funeral Mountain. You better get Captain Meadows. We're gonna need that jeep. Hold it. I gotta stop. We couldn't go through the checkpoints in this thing anyway. Trail six is clear. It bisects the course. Just follow this map. 'I think you can intercept them.' Right. Look, this looks like where he marked the arrow. So go that way. They said stay on the course. Hey, you read the newspaper clipping. That pilot could've crashed around here. And.. What that gadget may be picking up is an airplane signal. Okay. Hold it. We gotta stay on the beam. - Okay. The signal would come from, like, the mountain, right? 'Yeah.' That way. Funeral Mountain. Hey, Nattie, what would you say if I think we're being followed? - I know. Hey, there's somebody up ahead of us. It's gotta be Stomer. Hit it. Stop. Stop. Somebody drove off the course back there. The end of the rainbow. Whoo! It's all here. Come on. 'Come back!' Come back here! That gold's mine! Bring any handcuffs with you? No. I came to see you win the race. Now it looks like you won't even finish. Look, they're all in our custody. All except Mrs. Stomer. Anyhow, thanks for saving us. Hey, are we under arrest? Just don't run off until we get this thing sorted out. Uh, I'll see you guys back at the finish line. Hey, wait a minute, why don't you go back and get the champagne ready? Win, lose, or draw, we're gonna finish this race. And then you'll tell me what this is all about, right? Oh, yeah, yeah. We'll tell you everything we've done. Well, the only thing we haven't done is hit an unexploded shell. Ooh. I love it here. I love it.
