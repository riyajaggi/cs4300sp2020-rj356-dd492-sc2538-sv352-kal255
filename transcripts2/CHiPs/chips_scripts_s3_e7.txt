 '10-4, 7 Mary 3.' 'Officer down, Harbor Lane and Commerce.' Okay. He's breathing kind of shallow. His pulse rate's alright. - No. I heard you talking about the fellow we were chasing. Yeah, some guy last year he ran us ragged and then filmed it in living color. I remember. Roy Yarnell. Was it him? I don't know, I tell you one thing, though I'm going to find out. Hey, Ponch. Hey, man. What's the latest with Ponch? 
  subslikescript square adaptive  
 
 Well, he has, uh, broken ribs, broken arm, concussion. 'See?' 'That's just what I thought.' 'Same build, same style, same motor.' That's Yarnell last year the kid who got talked into committing a bunch of misdemeanors. The Red Phantom committed a felony. Roy Yarnell always has an escape route planned out and somebody moved that semi truck without the owner's knowledge. So? The Phantom has an accomplice. Anybody check out the fairgrounds? None of Yarnell's people were there just some of their equipment. 'Now, why would the star' 'of a world-famous thrill show' knock over a jewelry store? Well, I don't know. 'But we know how Ponch caught him last year' and I can do the same thing if we just get the Supercycle out of mothballs. Uh, sergeant, was there some reason you wanted me here? Uh...yeah, Harlan. Turn on the light. With just one robbery involved division would never approve the Supercycle. It's not just one robbery. I mean, it's Ponch. He's-- Look, I know. I know. We all feel the same way about Ponch. But you're too close to wanting revenge and this is just no time for that. Turn it over to LAPD. He's their problem, not ours. And will you clean this up? We got briefing in ten minutes, hmm? Hi. I'm here for the briefing. I'm Kathy Mulligan. Oh, hi. You're new. I'm Jon Baker. Hmm, I'm here visiting, observing. I'm in the process of reassignment. D-do you want me to give you a hand with this? Uh, well, who could say no, huh? Where are you from, Kathy? Well, um, I've been on a county duty for three years. Um, then after that, you know they let you pick your own station. So I came down here to look around. I thought I might like to try a big-city experience. I'm from a small town. Oh, really? Me too, uh, in Wyoming. Gee, maybe we ought to get together sometime and, um, compare corner drugstores. Uh, oh, yeah. Hey, would you mind doing me a favor? Uh, just put this away in the gun locker and I'll be back in a minute. I gotta do something before briefing alright? Thanks a lot. Hey. That's one you owe me. Thanks. The Supercycle. Can I see it? For a minute. Let me warn you, Jon, this is not the machine you knew a year ago. But there's nothing organically wrong with her. She just needs a little corrective attention. But I'm not gonna touch her without permission. Oh, Harlan, Getraer gave you permission. Now, look, if that Phantom strikes again he wants that Supercycle ready. Harlan, that's why you were in there. I was in there because you asked me in there. 'Because I know what he means by what he says.' In the meantime, uh, why don't you think about what happened to Ponch? Yeah. Harlan, you want to make some points? - Yeah. Uh, Grossman, Clark, Baricza, and Turner you'll convoy The Villanoor Diamond Collection again. It moves from the museum to Hewlett Bank And Trust this afternoon. Now, as, uh, some of you know we have a visitor from up North. I'm sure you'll show her every personal courtesy and our usual high-standard professional conduct. Officer Kathy Mulligan. From Sacramento. I found out. I won't be here for very long. Here to evaluate each one of us. But, uh, I-I hope I get a chance to know each one of you. Uh-huh. Mulligan's going with the diamond convoy team today and, Baricza, she can ride with you. Alright, uh, that's it. Careful, Bear, she'll be watching every move. Kathy, you'll find the car right over here. See you later. Hey, sarge, you can put your mind at ease. We got your message. Everything by the book as long as Inspecting Officer Mulligan's here, right? I don't believe I told you she was an inspecting officer. No, but we're hip. And we're going to make you proud of us. Yeah, well, um.. ...I-I-I want her to see us as, uh, we really are, you know? Hey, we're going to show her the highest professional standards she's ever filed a report on, okay? Well, thanks. Thanks, men. What's the number of that form? What form, Ponch? The one I got to fill out... for wrecking my motor. Look, you just forget about that, huh? Just relax and.. ...just be basically lazy. I talked to your, uh, mom and dad last night. - Yeah. I bet you charged it to my phone. Oh, no, no, no, uh.. ...the state paid for it. Tell me, is it Roy Yarnell? I don't know. Maybe. You know, I thought he'd be alright. I read all his ads and everything saw he was doing good, but.. Hey, that's what Frankenstein thought about his monster. Yeah. I'll find out, though. Sam, it's me, Max Beaumont. I started you in this business. Sam, it's me. Look, just a small loan, Sam, huh? Yeah. Immediate expenses. Tickets are going to start selling like crazy, believe me. I.. Look, I can pay it back next week. I'll call you back. Well, what is it? Another summons? Uh, no. I'm here to see Roy Yarnell. My star? Oh, please, you can't take my star. - It's a social visit. - Oh, well.. Listen, Roy's over on the track doing a stunt or two for the press. Go on. Go on over there. Thank you. Alright, folks, now I want you to get your cameras ready because here comes the fabulous Phantom himself Roy Yarnell! Hey, Jon! Jon! Hey, boys, I want you to meet a real good friend of mine. - This here's Jon Baker. - Roy. And this is Donny Joe King Kaptain Krazy himself, Link Burrows. Oh, down there is my advance man Pete Dunslay. Well, how have you been, and how's Ponch? - Ponch is in the hospital, Roy. - Wow. That's too bad. Well...what happened? I'd like to talk to you about that, alright? Yeah, sure thing, Jon. Uh.. Boys. Robbery? Robbery! Oh, now, Jon, you don't think I'd do something like that to Ponch. You're acting innocent. You were acting innocent last year. Look, if you did something, why don't you tell me now? Maybe I can help you. Look, Jon, last year, I needed the publicity. I-I-I got me a big show now. Big and broke. You aren't selling any tickets and you need the publicity. So where were you yesterday at 2 p.m., huh? Hey, Jon, ain't we friends? Yeah. Where were you, friend? You're a cop. You find out. Excuse me, officer? I sure hope there ain't nothin' going to hold up the show. You one of the performers, Mr. King? Shoot, no. I-I'm just a mechanic. I fixes things and what not. Oh. But I practices, though, in case Roy needs me. Hey...is Roy in some kind of trouble? Look, does Roy own a red stunt bike? A red one? No. I guess there's nothing to worry about, huh? 'All units in the vicinity of Adobe and Lindofin' '2-11 jewelry store.' 'Masked rider in red on a red motorcycle.' 'Northbound San Fernando Road at Horton.' We got it! Let's go. Turner, take the armored car. 7 Mary 3 to Sotto at mission. Look at this thing. I think the frame's cracked too. Man, this is bad. The fur's going to fly when she reports on this. Bear, she is not reporting. LA 15, Mary 3, code 4 on the motorcycle pursuit. Send a motorcycle truck to Loma Prieta drive-in. - '10-4.' He tried so hard, but the Phantom escaped. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine. I'll tell you one thing, I would have caught that turkey if I would have had the right machine. Whoa. Harlan, I've got to talk to you. How's the Supercycle? Fine. I see you broke a bag. Oh, I cracked the frame too, but.. Well, that's no problem. Harlan, it is. It is a problem. But we've got the answer. How's the Supercycle? I told you. Fine. Well, can you have her ready by tomorrow? - Sure, if I work tonight. - Well, do it. Then we will tell Getraer that my machine isn't ready but the Supercycle is. That'll give him a chance to let me use it. Uh-huh. Is he going to okay my overtime? Oh, I'm sure he will. I'll handle Getraer when I see him, okay? I see him. Alright, I knew what you were up to and I sympathize with your feelings but I have orders not to use that machine. I thought that was clear to both of you. - Don't blame Harlan. - Oh, I don't. I'd blame Poncherello, but he's in the hospital. You know.. ...somehow Ponch would have made this work. Maybe Getraer's playing it safe on account of Kathy Mulligan. Kathy has no interest in the Supercycle. And if she did, she'd probably tell me. Hey, Baker.. ...how serious is it between you and this, uh, lady spy? Ponch, come on. Alright? I mean, she's not a spy. That serious, huh? Well, um, I'll tell you what. I'll let you know after today, alright? I'm going to take her to the fairgrounds. Romantic. Oh, well, maybe she, uh.. ...would dig on heroes if you catch her a Phantom. I think I have Getraer half convinced that if I would have had the Supercycle I could have caught him today. Baker, I knew you'd carry on for me, man. What do you mean? Well...I'm not there to give the sarge a bad time. Somebody has to do it. Well...I have him half convinced but, uh, I sent Turner down to the fairgrounds just to check out that robbery but no one was there except a bunch of phone installers. They were installing some phones in Thril-A-Thon trailers. - Four on Wednesday. - Yes, sir. I'd be happy to. - 'Thank you very much--' - Okay, listen. Put down, uh, Sanchez uh, block of 20 at will call. - Okay. What? The Red Phantom. Ha ha ha. No, no. We don't have him, but Roy's the original. Yeah, and he will put goose bumps on your goose bumps. Okay, but listen, don't wait too long. Turning around, is it, Max? Oh, the Red Phantom, bless his heart. What a shot in the arm. - Yeah. - Yeah. 'Units in the vicinity of Main and Hill' 'a jewelry store 2-11, 2-2-9 Rua Court.' 'Suspect in red and white leather on a red motorcycle' 'Westbound on Main.' I want that guy. I want him. The Supercycle, Joe. Supercycle? Right. You got it. Whoo! Alright, Jon. She's yours tomorrow. I'll go call division and tell them what we're up to. Alright. Uh, R-Roy, I work my tail off for you. I do reservations, I do PR, I do all the arrangements. Yeah, but I own the show. Now, if I was out of the way you boys could just take over, right? Maybe make a big star out of Kaptain Krazy here, huh, Link? Oh, big ideas. Well, maybe you and Donny Joe King. You know, when I found you boys, you didn't have one thin dime between you. Hey, Roy. That's your friends you're accusing, man. Oh, no. No. I'm the one getting accused. I got cops following me, even little kids just waiting to see me do it again and the thing is that I ain't done it yet. It's selling tickets, Roy. Now, you've known that all along. Well, it's gone too far, Max. Now, if one of you is the Phantom.. Where you been, Donny Joe? I thought I told you to be in here. Well, I was out fixing Link's bike, Roy. Alright, now listen. I ain't never stole anything in my life and this Phantom sucker's out there stealing my reputation! Now, if one of you is him, I want you to quit it. I mean, you quit! Say, Roy, the folks outside is waiting for that practice session. - Howdy. - Hey, Roy Yarnell. This is Kathy Mulligan. - Howdy. - Hi. And that's Artie Grossman. You remember him. Glad you folks could make it down. How's Ponch doing? - Uh, he's improving. - 'Good.' You folks stick around and have a good time. I'm afraid today's kind of tame, though. But tomorrow, tomorrow we're gonna be trying a flying stunt and that is something you all ought to see. - Yeah. If it works, we're going to stick it in the show next week. Uh, well, look, you folks excuse me. I got to get back to these reporters. 'Take it easy.' Oh, how you folks doing? Uh, let me buy you a soft drink or something. - That'd be great. Thanks. Anything, as long as it's cold. Uh, loan me a couple of ducats, Pete, huh? I left my wallet in the trailer. Yeah, sure. Come on. I'll help you carry. Be right back. Did you hear what Beaumont just said? Lend me a couple of ducats? - Yeah. No, that's a prison term for money. See, they used to issue coupons to the inmates for chewing gum, candy, things like that. Uh, Grossman, uh, maybe you'd better check it out, huh? Uh, I'll report it to the proper agency as department regulations require. I pity the woman who marries you, Jon. She's never gonna be able to stay on a diet. Of course, I suppose she could worry herself thin. You know, all my cooking is basically heat it and eat it. This is my one dish, and, uh, I was trying to impress you. Well, I'm impressed. Here. Why don't you let me help you with the dishes? Oh, no, no. Not till I get to know you better. Okay. Why don't we start with, um, corner drugstores? You or me? Uh, Kathy, I want to ask you a question, alright? Well, the answer is probably maybe. Look, uh, you've been making a lot of calls to Sacramento. Whoa. Well, I hope gossip's a form of flattery. Yeah, at the good old corner drugstore. Look, is something going on that maybe is none of my business? Oh, Jon. I just didn't think you were part of all of this.. ...the Mata Hari Mulligan group. That I'm some kind of spy from headquarters. Oh. You know about that too, huh? My only other choice for transfer is Yreka. I was supposed to go up there Monday to look it over. I just need some more time, Jon. How about some persuasion? Grossman. Are you sure? Nobody has his timing. Hey, Jon, I found out a couple of things I thought you might wa.. ...want me to tell you about in the morning, okay? So don't forget. 'Cause I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Grossie, why don't you come on in and be civilized? Oh, okay. Hey, you're really taking this big. 'Hi.' Uh, okay, what have you got? Max Beaumont served 31 months in San Quentin for embezzling from his boss. He ran, are you ready for this? A motorcycle dealership. Oh, I didn't even know he rode one. Never seen it. He's about the right size, though. The others have no California records but I'm running checks on all of them through the FBI. Mmm, good. That's good. The proper agency. Oh, ha ha. She's just kidding, Grossie. Here. Okay. Oh, one more thing. Uh, jewelry stores don't keep their good stuff in the windows. Uh, LAPD gave me the Phantom's total take, three robberies. Six hundred and fifty six dollars and change. That's hardly worth the risk and the effort. Yeah, either he's going to keep doing it till he gets a ride or, uh, he's working up to something big. 'Hey, Max.' Where are you going? Oh, uh, let the answering service know when you leave, huh, Roy? I'm going out to the airfield to make sure everything's right for the flying stunt. So, what's this flying stunt? I don't know. He's gonna try to fly a motorcycle. How? How? Through the air. Who knows how? Anyhow, uh, look, I got permission to use the Supercycle. Jon, I got Roy last year because somebody told us where he was gonna be. He's going to be at the airfield this afternoon. Then back to the fairgrounds, right? Everyone goes his own way. Has a half-baked alibi. Perfect time to pull a job, man. Oh, yes, ma'am. At the box office. You're welcome. Roy Yarnell's world-famous Thril-A-Thon. Who wants Roy? Herb Winsler, "LA Post-Dispatch." I'd like to do a feature on him for tomorrow's edition. Well, this is him. Oh, no, no. I-I-I'll be kind of busy next couple of hours. Could you meet me downtown, say at the La Condesa Restaurant? About 5 o'clock? See, I like to meet my deadline. Well, maybe. In costume. You want me to bring the stunt bike too? Yeah, we'll get some great pictures back in the alley, yeah. Hey, great! Yeah, thanks, Mr. Yarnell. Mr. Beaumont. Well, Officer Baker, you couldn't stay away, huh? You know, I don't know how you do it but once in my life I'm going to see a motorcycle uh...fly? How you doing? So that's how you do it, huh? Yep. Oh, there she is. - Oh, look at that baby. - Yeah. Oh, you're gonna catch that Phantom sucker now for sure. If I'm in the right place. Roy, for goodness sake, be careful. - Yeah. If anything goes wrong I want you to abort. I just finished painting the bike. Roy's backup costume is right next to it in the garage. Everything's set for the big one. You sure Roy's gonna be there? My man is expecting a reporter and a photographer, Donny Joe. I'm betting a two million dollar diamond he'll be there. Roy should've let me ride in the show. Donny Joe, will you forget that? You just grab that Villanoor rock and you ride. They'll grab Roy. By the time they figure out they got the wrong Phantom we'll be halfway across the Atlantic and set for life. Great! Great. Alright! I.. Come on. Take some pictures. - Alright! - Alright! - Whoo! - Great. It's wonderful. Hey, don't you ever answer your radio? Well, I called in 10-7. Alright. What's up? You requested a check on all these people. Who's Peter Dunslay? He did felony time in Ohio. His name's Dunbar Peters. He's a jewel thief. Roy. Look, where's Peter Dunslay? Does he ride a motor? Oh, I don't know, but I got a phone call you folks might be interested in. It was supposed to be a reporter for an interview and photographs, but this is the first time one ever asked me to come in full dress and meet him in an alley. What alley Uh, behind the, uh.. ...La Condesa Restaurant. La Condesa? That's across from Hewlett Bank and Trust. That's where he's been setting up all along. The Villanoor diamond. Alright, notify the LAPD, would you? 'Units in the vicinity of Main and Hill' 'a possible 2-11 in progress, Hewlett Bank and Trust.' 'Suspect motorcycle Phantom, westbound on Main.' Step out of the cab. I can't find neutral. Hey! Let's go. Hands on your head. Let's go. Uh, yeah, alright, Jon! Roy, you should've let me ride in the show. Donny Joe...you had to land in a truck full of boxes. Now there's a man who can ride. Boy, I wish Ponch could've seen you, man. He would've been so proud of you. I knew you'd catch that turkey! Yeah. Him and you too, Roy. - Yeah. Speeding, running red lights, reckless riding. Aw, Jon. LA 15 Mary-3. We're 10-98. Two in custody. Requesting landline message to Officer Poncherello in Valley General Hospital. Mission accomplished. I was so terrified you were going to crash. Well, there's always a chance. I suppose I could get used to the freeways and all this rush and crush.. ...but I don't think I'd ever get used to worrying about you. I might come back someday, but.. Hey, listen, Yreka's a nice little town but, uh, that is, if you'd like maybe there'll be a place for me there someday, huh? Take care of yourself, okay? Bye-bye. Hey, Ponch? Yeah, come on in. Gonna look at some movies, uh, the guys brought by. How you doing? Okay. Ponch, uh.. ...where'd you get this? I was out there alone, I mean that is supposed to be a secret. This has got to be destroyed. Wait till Getraer sees this. 'What do you mean?' 'Getraer shot the film.' Uh-huh. Uh, sarge, uh.. Look, uh, you know, what I was trying to do I didn't have any choice. I mean-- Evel Knievel. Hey, hey..
