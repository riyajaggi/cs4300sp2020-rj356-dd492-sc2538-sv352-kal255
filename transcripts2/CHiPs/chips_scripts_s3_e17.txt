 - Solkin, Dale. - Yep. Bickel, Lloyd. Oh, oh, that's me. - Follow me, gentlemen. You've been arrested, remember? You're going to court. It's your preliminary hearing. Let's move it. Well, that's it till we go inside. Alright, shall I gather up the kids? Oh, no. They're alright. - We have a few minutes. - Oh, alright. All this trouble over dealing in grass? And grand theft auto. We didn't steal that car, officer. Let's go. We just borrowed it, that's all. - Hmm. We left a note for this guy and everything. - Nice note. - Yeah. I'll bet you Judge Hamlin will just fall right off the bench. He'll love that story. Just trying to intimidate us, ain't you? No. I'm trying to deliver you, so let's move. - I want a drink of water. - It's time for court. Why can't I have a drink of water? I said it's time for court. It's his right to have a drink of water. - It is in the constitution. - That's right. You want me to put the cuffs on both of you? This here officer's violating this man's rights! My gosh. Well, my big sister loved me, but, uh, I tell you if they would have told her to squire me around like you're doing for Pete I think she would have left Wyoming for good. Oh, I'll bet you're just as lovable to her as Pete is to me. Yeah, well, as a matter of fact I thought so. Of course.. Hey, listen, what a kid brother thinks is funny can sometimes give a big sister fits, huh? - They're so big. - Big. - Oh, yeah. Put on the helmet. Now you're a big motorcycle man. - Right. Right. - Macho man. - Bet these go fast. - Bet you they do. - Yeah, okay. Now, we're going to put this on you and then you don't have to yell at anybody. Alright? Okay. Hey, grab him before he hits the gear shift! - Hey, let me go. - Come on, get off there. - Come on now, slow down. - Pete, you should know better. - And you, too, Ray. - Alright, now. You two characters. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. Okay. I'm gonna make it simple for you. We're due in the judge's chambers in ten minutes. For ten minutes, you say nothing you do nothing, you try nothing. You hear that? Hey, just behave. Is that clear? - Yes, sir. - Yes, ma'am. Okay, fellas, I want to talk to you. If our reporter got that on film I don't think we looked very good. Oh, yeah? Who can look good escorting those two kids? And Getraer said this was going to be a cushy assignment. "You'll enjoy it," he said. Really, but once we get them inside I mean, what can we do? What, The Blob and Godzilla? They could start World War III, man. So from here, we go into the chambers and then into the courtroom of superior court judge Albert Armeda. Okay, cut. Thank you, Harry. Pete never means any harm, but when he and Ray are together they have so much energy to expend. Uh, he couldn't have ridden the motorcycle but he could have got hurt. Both of them could have. Hey, guys, it's time to go in and see the judge. Pete! Ray! 'Boys! Come on, boys! Where are you?' Hey, a bar! Champagne,please, Peter. Yes. Right away, sir. Keys. Here, try it, just once. I'll bet you can't even hear the engine. 'Boys!' Peter! Raymond! Come on, fellas, where are you? 'Peter! Raymond! Come on!' - I don't know. But the engine is running. Pete Costello, Raymond! You two sound off right now! - Keep cool. - 'Okay.' Look important. Pete! Ray! There they go in that car! Just wait right here, alright? The license plate, it said Flagon. I know, I know, I'll send another unit. I can't believe it. - I got you. - Knock it off, Lloyd. Let them go. The doors are locked. I'm going to let you guys go! Grand theft auto, kidnapping 'assault. You guys are in heavy trouble.' Those two CHiPs know you took us. You better let us out. Yeah, well, if they know.. ...how come they're not chasing us, huh? Now, look. Look. There are no cops there. They better not stop us. 'Cause we got you. 'You're our insurance, understand?' Hey, uh, kid, uh, what is your dad? Well, he's some kinda big shot or something, huh? 'What is he, a judge?' - My dad's an engineer. - This isn't the car. Yeah, well, you just stay put and stay quiet. 'We're not going to hurt you, so don't be scared.' We're not scared. Why are you guys on the lam? Well, we came into town, and we were broke and we started dealing in some grass and-- Put a cork in it, Lloyd. No, no, we're-we're innocent, really. Uh, what's your plan? Well, we're going to get out of LA. Shouldn't have come here in the first place. 15-Mary 3 and 4 maintaining visual contact with suspect. '15-Mary 4, 10-4.' 'Don't know yet whether this is a 2-0-7' 'or a practical joke.' 'Have all units' switch to blue channel two and keep it on clearance until this thing is resolved. No hot pursuit. We don't wanna push the situation into panic. 'Yeah. Figure we'll head up North.' After that, once we're over the border into Canada we can unload this for a bundle. Man, man, that-that's the saddest getaway plan I've ever heard. Me too. For openers, do you guys know what freeway to take? We'll figure it out. Yeah. Yeah. We'll get a map. On the freeway? Look, take the interchange up ahead and get off at the Santa Monica freeway. Go West until you hit the San Diego. - We live here, mister. Pete and I wrote an essay on the freeway. We studied 'em. We know. Dale, go up to the interchange, and make a-- 'I heard 'em. I heard 'em.' Just stay loose, okay? It's a terrific story. I'll let you know a location for the camera crew as soon as I can. I know Jon's right. Kid brothers do crazy things. But this is too far out, even for Pete. I just can't believe it's a joke. We see a lot of unusual situations, Ms. Costello. I made some creative notes on an interesting one last month. See, I do a little writing. Grossman! Huh? Lieutenant, take care of Ms. Costello. - Make sure somebody's with her. - Right, sarge. '15-Mary 3 and 4' 'suspect vehicle now on the transition road' 'to the westbound Santa Monica.' 15-Mary 3 and 4 maintaining visual contact with suspect vehicle. 15-Mary 3 and 4 2 WMA 11-500 suspects attacked deputy at the courthouse and escaped. 'Try to determine conditions in that' 'vehicle without igniting anyone.' This is a 2-0-7 situation. Regard the juveniles as hostages in danger. No, Pat! No! Stay back! 'Stay back!' Pat, get back! If they see we're following they might hurt the kids! Get back! How much do you think one of these jobbies cost? Sixty two thousand. No kidding, huh? I bet it comes loaded. Radio, air conditioning, everything. Hey, Lloyd, I got to go. You got to what? Not until Canada, kid. That's over 2,000 miles. I mean it. I don't feel good. Dale, he don't feel good-- 'I heard him. I heard him.' - He's in pain. - I'm sick. Shut up. Y-you got to stop for gas sometime. We'll buy gas if you stop. Hey, Dale, hey, that's right. We don't have any money. How much you got on you, kid? You stop first. Five bucks. Just passed Henson Road off-ramp. Still in visual contact. Nothing unusual. We can move in any time. 10-4, Mary 4. We're monitoring all the off-ramps ahead of you. Stay close enough to protect those kids. S-4, this is Mary 3. Can you form a rolling block ahead of us? How's the traffic flow? Uh, moderate. Slowing down. I think we can, uh, grab up on the rolls and surprise them. 10-4, Jon. 'We'll run a rolling brake' 'as soon as I can get a unit in position.' 15-Mary 3 and 4, I'm running a traffic brake ahead of you West of Robertson. 10-4, 7-Adam. We're moving in. All units, got caught up to the rolling block westbound Santa Monica. Back up, move in. We'll make the stop. Jon, wrong car. 'All units, this is Mary 3. This is the wrong Rolls.' - 'They must have turned off.' - 7-Adam, release your traffic. 10-4. Come on, let's go. You okay, Pete? I-I'm still a little weak from my illness. Get in the car. Senor, yo no comprendo. All units, 7-Charles I had the black Rolls-Royce license Frank-Lincoln- Adam-George-Ocean-Nora departing a service station Henson and Mill road. 'Uh, I got jammed up, and I lost 'em.' 'He re-entered the freeway, Mill Road interchange' 'direction unknown.' 10-4, 7-Charles. Excuse me, have you seen a black Rolls with Flagon license plates? It's your move. He said they were here, but, uh that's all he knows. The kids left this "4-0-5 N." San Diego freeway North. S-4, this is Mary 3. The kids left a note. They're northbound on the 4-0-5 freeway. 'We'll be following it up.' 10-4, Mary 3. I'll back you up with Mary 5. 'All units, 15-S-4, BOL the black Rolls-Royce.' 'License Flagon' 'northbound 4-0-5.' 'Report it, but stay clear.' 'Repeat, stay clear.' Hey, Jon, I can get ahead of him and fake a breakdown in front of him and stop him. Yeah, or have, uh, two tons of Rolls-Royce run over your motor. I'm going to borrow this car. You tell Getraer. I got to be out of my tree. I think he has a good idea. Hey, listen, mister, uh how about.. ...forty bucks? - No. - Yes. I said, no! Well, he said, yes, so just do it and save time. Why, so that you can make a better story? I'm just doing my job. I could take the car. Now you don't have to. ♪ Play it again for me ♪ That sweet haunting melody ♪ Those bittersweet words that remind me of love ♪ ♪ Long ago ♪ Hey, look. Look, Dink. 'Dig this boat ahead of us, man.' That is my main fantasy, man a fat, sassy Rolls like that. Whoo! Lloyd, cops don't do that. You're right. Some kids in a van. Help!

'You guys shut up! And get down!' Those guys give us any flak 'I'm telling you right now, kids' 'you're in trouble for sure.' Yeah. You kids are gonna be in trouble. We heard him. 15-Mary-3. I got them. A cop, Oggie, right behind us. Hey, come here! Kidnap! Kidnap! The little boys up there kidnapped! He says, no. What is he, off-duty or something? Hey, kidnapped! Kidnapped! Rolls-Royce! - Nothing! Oh, brother. - Kidnapping, man! - Kidnapping! - Rolls-Royce! - Rolls-Royce, up ahead! 'Dale, listen, they're still back there.' I know it. I hear 'em. I hear 'em. It's a cop. Really, it's a cop, Dale. Stay down. Get out of here! Kidnapping in the car! Pull it over! Oh, man, he wants us to pull over. Pull it over right now! It's the van. Dale. It's them. 'Those kids are really going to get reamed now. Ha ha.' Will you turn off the radio? Hey, man, that Rolls-Royce with the Flagon plates. Hey, cut the horn, would you, please? It's stuck, man. Look, we got the kidnap covered. Now, just be on your way and stay away from the Rolls, huh? Oh, and, uh, thanks for your help. Big deal. That was Ponch that just passed. I know. Grossie, you back up Jon five seconds behind. We'll try another rolling traffic block. Hey, I told you kids to stay down. U-u-uh, stop-stop pushing us around. We just wanted to see where we are. Okay, okay, I just don't wanna hurt you, kid. You okay? Look, we can't squish down here all the way to Canada. 'Lloyd, put some music on the radio.' What kind of music do you like, kids? Country western, punk rock? Beethoven. What? The century on ramp will put me a mile ahead of them. 10-4, 7-Charles. Notify me when you're in position. '15-S-4 LA, helicopter H-8' 'is available now to join you on 10.' 10-4, OA, send him on. I ain't never figured you'd get static in a Rolls. Ah, we're out of range. Get another station. I figured on a rig like this that you could pick up stuff from as far away as, uh, all over. 'A black Rolls-Royce.' ' ' - Get it back. Get it back. - Whoa. 'Frank-Lincoln-Adam- George-Ocean-Nora.' - 'License Flagon. Repeat..' - 'License Flagon.' - I think it's the cops. 'All units watch for helicopter H-8' 'approaching from Southwest.'

Ponch said they'd start World War III in about ten minutes. I guess they did, huh? Well, those kids were pretty cool, but I bet you they'll remember this for quite a while. So will we the next time the sergeant offers us a cushy assignment. We'll think about it. Hey, Poncherello, don't complain. You're on overtime. Ms. Costello, I'm sure happy those kids are safe.
