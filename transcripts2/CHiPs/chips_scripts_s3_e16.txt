 Man's dream, huh, Ponch? To soar like a bird on the wing. And that's from a guy who spends all his free time with his horses. Well, I have no choice, Ponch. I can't find a bird big enough to saddle. Wish we had a clubhouse that dirt didn't always fall into. Yeah. Well, it's like the old pioneer days, Bobby. They lived in sod houses. - You know, dirt.

 Oh. Come on, we better hurry or we'll miss the school bus. See your driver's license and registration, please? Look, I'm already late to work. First it's the wife, and now it's you guys. What did I do? Officer, I asked you what I did. Do you mind answering the question? You were across the double line coming over that bridge wrong side of the road. Alright. Alright, I was upset. Those kids shook me up. What kids?

 The two kids on the embankment. Well, hey, you know, there were two kids on that bank but you...you fellas didn't see 'em, huh? Hey, listen, kids or no kids we observed erratic operation of your vehicle, alright? 'Now, you being a fireman, a public servant in uniform' don't you think you could set a little better example? Could I just have the ticket and forget the lecture? Read this and sign. That's the bottom line? Thanks a lot. Here. Thank you very much and have a nice day. You know, if you want to go hang gliding this weekend I'll reserve a couple of gliders Saturday. Sounds great, but what about your horse? The horse gets airsick. - Ha ha ha! - Morning. - Sarge. - Hi, sarge. Hey, Jon, look at this. "EMT." "Three hours a day for two work weeks. Volunteers will be accepted for the current class." At UCLA, a beautiful campus, beautiful girls beautiful air-conditioned rooms. No angry motorists.. ...no smoggy freeway. It's a vacation with pay and fringe benefits. Ha! To make sure it's clear in all of your bright little minds reports are not complete until every line has been dealt with either with the information requested or a line drawn through it indicating that it has been read but does not apply. I-I know, I know. You all knew that, right? Okay. Anything from the floor? 'Poncherello.' Uh, sarge, if it's true there's an emergency medical training course coming up. Jon and I would like to volunteer. Hey, I've heard about that. I'd like a shot at it, too. So would I! Alright, alright, alright. Hold it. Hold it. Frank, you don't usually volunteer for anything. We think the course is a good opportunity, sarge. In most cases, we arrive at the scene before the paramedics. 'Sometimes we can help, but more often' 'all we can do is keep the crowd back and stand there' 'helpless to assist the victims.' We'd like to learn how to do more. We could save lives. Frank...huh. You surprise me. No. You-you impress me. Alright, you got it. - Hey! - Hey, what do you mean.. Wait a minute! Alright, alright, hold it! Hold it! 'Hold it, hold it.' Like the notice said only two CHP volunteers will be accepted. And Baker and Poncherello had their bids in first. - Uh, excuse me. - 'Grossman.' I took the EMT Course at Santa Monica Hospital last June. Or was it July? June. That's right. It was June. And I wouldn't have volunteered for it in any event-- Grossman, make your point. I didn't see any notice. - Neither did I. - Hey, that's right. I didn't see one, either. 'What's' Well, maybe the rest of you should take a page out of Baker and Poncherello's book. Now, obviously they had the interest to check the notices on the bulletin board. Jon, Frank, report to UCLA at 3 o'clock this afternoon. Congratulations, Ponch. You pulled off another one. Whatever does he mean? If you had to eat every piece of cake you grabbed off you'd weigh 300 pounds. - I don't know. But I'm sure glad he's on our side of the law. Ha ha ha! Sarge, about tomorrow morning.. Why would you want to come to work over three hours late? UCLA. 3:00 to 6:00. We'll be putting in three hours there. Yeah, but you're on the A shift. 6:00 A.M. But, sarge, that's a 12-hour day. That's okay, Jon. Think of the overtime. - No, Frank. No overtime. I thought you guys read the notice? You volunteered for EMT on your own time. Did I? Mm-hmm. Look at this. "Non-compensated basis." Well, always read the small print, Jon. Yeah. I'll try to remember that. See, Jon? Money isn't the only compensation going. You make a point, but too bad we're ten minutes late. Hey, no way we're gonna get off duty at 2:30 and make it here by 3 o'clock unless we come in uniform. Keep some clothes in the locker, change there, huh? '...covering the good Samaritan laws of California' 'and other states is..' Are you gentlemen sure you have the right room? This class started at 3 o'clock. - Uh, sorry about that. - Sorry. You are.. - Uh, Baker. - Poncherello. Oh, yes, it's the triple A with a gun. Well, fear not, ladies and gentlemen the highway patrol has landed. Late. Alright, I'm a paramedic. I teach this class, and my name, as you know, is Michael Adams. 'Now, it's my purpose to qualify you' 'as emergency medical technicians' valuable and essential lay members of a life-saving profession. 'In this course, we'll cover everything' from pulmonary and cardiac arrest to burns, shock, exposure-- Connie! Get his arm! Help him! Wait a minute. Let me give you a hand there. Stop. This is wrong. The man has an obstruction in his throat and he's unable to breathe. 'Alright, the first thing we have to try' is to remove that obstruction from his throat. The head has to be lower than the body. 'And we try first to remove that object from the airway.' 'Now, if that doesn't work' with the heel of our hand between the shoulder blades we firmly hit. Alright, now, if that hadn't have worked 'we would have gone to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.' Is there, uh, is there some reason you fellows are losing interest? What would you have done? We learned the Heimlich method. You did? Would you please be seated? Thank you. This is my assistant Roy Hanson. As you probably all know, this was a demonstration. Thanks, buddy. Alright, we have to give some credit to the stewardesses. 'At least they tried to do something.' Uh, since our CHiPs. people already know the Heimlich method we won't bore them with it. We'll take that up the next time they're late. Nice campus, huh? No highways, no smoke.. Hey, and fringe benefits. Huh. I think we let him off too easy on that citation. The supplies and equipment for care of the airways artificial ventilation, suction, oxygenation they're placed at the front of the litter. Those for cardiac resuci.. 'Poncherello..' '...Baker..' ...control of external hemorrhage the administration of intravenous agents and the monitoring of blood pressure where would I place that equipment? Beside the litter. That's a good guess. Beside the litter. 'So a tourniquet is only used in very severe cases.' Such as an amputation. Most bleeding is venous and not arterial and can be easily controlled by direct pressure. Well, that's about it, uh, until 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. Don't forget to read the first ten chapters tonight. All of you. That's the longest three hours I've spent since time was invented. Well, it's YMCA Boys' Night tonight. They hate long lectures. They got to be in bed early. I'll be home by 10:00, huh. Mike, you know you probably won't. Someone will talk. You'll stay. Will you say goodnight to Warren for me.. Honey, take the time. He's in his room. Margo, I don't need the pressure. There it is, huh? Take a look. Honey, it's the YMCA, the church the high school, the service club. Every night, there's something. If I look concerned for you, I am. Well, you know, this is my work. You know how I feel about it. You've always known. Yes, but I don't know how you feel about yourself anymore or your home. You can't go day and night forever, Mike. Yeah, I can. Long as I'm needed. Where Fine. Go. But your wife and son are here. Mike, we love you. This is really something. Not many of these around. When you said "One glider," I thought you were crazy. Well, maybe I am. One's cheaper than two. Can we get down there? We can try. We can land on that ledge. You are crazy, but we can try. Left arm is shattered. He's got a bleeding artery, Ponch. It's under the armpit. We're gonna have to apply some pressure. 'It's almost impossible.' 'It's gonna take the rescue team an hour' 'to get here and get him out.' I don't think he can make it. Hang in there, pal. Just hang in there. We got you. Cut your strap, Ponch. Put this under here for pressure. We need a rope! A long rope! We can belay him up or down but down's a whole lot faster. Either way, we'll bust his artery wide open. Either way, he's gonna either bleed to death or die of shock. 'Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.' Let's fly him down. Yeah, maybe. You said I'm crazy. They were yelling for a rope. Hey, down there! This is the highway patrol! I've got a nylon rope! Bonnie Clark? 'Who is that' Jon and me. We need the rope. Tie it off! - Yeah. I'm gonna take the pressure off. Alright. - Better hurry up. - Alright. Okay, Ponch, give me your chute. Ah! Is it tight? - Okay. - 'Okay.' Jon, Ponch, here's the line! - Okay, I got him. - Alright. Swivel him around. I can help you take off, meet you down there, help you land. LA-15, 7 Charles. Notify beach patrol and roll a rescue vehicle to Ladder Point beach. We have an 11-80. '10-4, 7 Charles.' Whenever you're ready. Alright, go! You'll be alright, okay, pal? How about you? Piece of cake. Poncherello, Baker, and I'm Clark. Got it. I'm gonna make a fortune with these pictures. Hey, you guys were terrific! Hey, thanks a lot. Anytime! 'I want this exercise treated' as if it were absolutely real. So you keep your minds on what's important. 'Assess your patients' needs..' work quickly, and get 'em ready for transport. Alright, let's get at it. 'Poncherello' You guys are really heroes. We just happened to be there. Well, you'll get another chance to be heroes.. only this time, there won't be any photographers around. Alright, get the man on the man on the board and up the hill! Up the hill? Hey, fella, can you help us out? Not me. I'm unconscious. This is really fun. I'm glad we're here, Jimmy. Yeah. Me, too. It's better than being yelled at all the time. That baby-sitter, that's all she ever does when mom's at work, yell at us. 'That's what baby-sitters do.' They're a real pain sometimes. Those truckers! Now we got to clean up again. Working day and night so we can take a class we'll probably get flunked out of anyway. I'm sorry I got you into this, partner. Yeah, I had visions of sugarplums just like you did, Ponch. I'm still sore from pulling that guy up the hill three times. We got to get Adams off our back. I mean, no way I'm spending all that time studying at class, at work, at home and then not even get certified. Jon, you can only solve half the problem by talking it over with yourself. Still not sure this is a good idea. Huh. You talking to yourself? Oh. You must be Poncherello and Baker. Right. Please come on in. Please sit down. Mike isn't home yet, but he should be here any minute. Thank you. 'Officer Poncherello' Officer Baker, I would like you to meet my son, Warren. Warren is just learning to use his brand-new legs. Warren. Here you are, Warren. 'Oh.' They teach you how at the hospital. At first, I fell down a lot. 'And when I grow bigger' I get bigger.. ...prothestic devices. Prosthetic. Prosthetic. Well, artificial legs. 'Anyhow, my mom helps me out a lot' and the doctors say I'm doing just fine. Dr. Stegman really does say he's never seen anyone adjust so quickly. What is this? What are you guys doing here? Mike, they looked for you at the office and called you there. I told them you'd be glad to see them. Well, you were wrong. Warren, go to your room, son. Now. Listen, we just thought maybe we could help you straighten out the problem you seem to be having-- Well, then keep your nose where it belongs and your mind on what's important. Wait a minute. What does that mean? It means that my kid would've not have lost his legs.. if anybody...anybody at that accident had have known what you guys are supposed to be learning in EMT. Mike, I don't-- 'You know, if you clowns' paid as much attention to your classwork as you do to harassing citizens and chasing down headlines you might, you just might learn something.. ...that could prevent a kid from being handicapped for life. Ponch, we better be going. You realize Adams ignored us in class yesterday? First time he hasn't singled us out. Yeah. The calm before the storm. You know what he's been doing for the past three years? Yeah. Blaming himself and everybody else for his son's accident. It's pretty heavy, you know? I just parked my car, got out and that idiot smashed into it. He has to be loaded. - No. Maybe he is. Alright, folks, make some room. Please step back. Come on, step back. Okay, buddy. Hey, come on. Come on. He's out like a light. I don't smell any booze. 'Uh-oh. A medical tag.' 'Coronary.' 'Let's get him on the ground.' - I'll blow, you push. - Alright. Not bad. Whee! Alright, you've checked out the victim severe head and neck injuries and a fractured tibia. What do you do first? Immobilize the neck with a cervical collar. Alright. Next? Secure the head and neck to a short spinal board. Right. 'Next.' Uh, secure the victim's upper body to the board and remove him from the vehicle. That's wrong. Poncherello.. 'We've secured the victim's head and neck' 'to the short spinal board.' Why can't we remove him from the vehicle? He also has a broken tibia. His broken leg should be immobilized by fixing it to the opposite leg with bandages. I got it wired. Alright, now we can safely remove the victim from the vehicle. Is that correct, Baker? Baker? Well, is there any danger of fire or explosion? No. Well, you don't move a neck injury without a long spinal board. You might cause damage to the spinal cord therefore causing paralysis. That's right. I got it wired, too. Whoa. That was close, huh, Jimmy? Yeah. Oh, look. More dirt. Do we clean it up? No. We better go home before that baby-sitter finks on us. Jimmy! Jimmy! Get up! Jimmy! Jimmy, get up! Come on! LA-15, Mary 4 and 3. 10-97.. Step back, please. Get back from the car, would you, please! Step back there. Thank you. Paramedics be here in a second. What do you got? He's pretty well banged up. Gonna have a hard time getting him out. This door's welded close. - 'Help!' - Jon, listen. He's not alone. 'Help! Help!' There's a kid. 'Help!' 'Help! Help!' It's right here, Jon! Right here! Listen! 'Help! Help!' Help! Help! Have you done anything for him? I left him alone. I don't know what his injuries are yet. - 'Help!' - Listen, we got a problem. We got a kid buried in a dugout. I need a shovel. Well, do you know where to find it! Help! Help! Come on, Jimmy. Help! Help! Depressed frontal skull fracture 'sternum is depressed' lacerations and cervical damage. - Get it. Are you gonna get us out? We're coming! Are you alright? My brother's hurt! Who's all in there? 'Me and Jimmy! Hurry, please!' Alright! What's your name? Bobby Shelton! Okay, Bobby, listen to me.. ...we'll be with you in a second...alright? 'Okay.' Okay. I'll go in. Hi, Bobby. I'm Ponch. Can you help my brother? Sure. No problem. Let me check him out. Tell you what, Bobby he needs a bandage for his head and we need you outside so you can help pull him out. So what you do is you slide out on your belly, okay? - I'll be right with you. Sure. Better take a look at the guy's hips. I think he has a broken pelvis. We're gonna need a long board. - Right. Good idea. - Okay. Come on, son. Thanks. The other one's unconscious. 'Head injuries, maybe some ribs. If I can--' I'll get him. 'Bobby, this is Joe.' How you doing, Bobby? He's got a boy just about your age. And what's more, he's the sergeant. We're gonna bring his brother Jimmy out. Well, okay, Bobby, you want to tell me about it? - Poncherello! - 'Yo!' These broken ribs are no problem! Bring me a dressing for his head! You got it! Okay, son, alright? Uh. Uh.. Ah! - Yeah. Hey. Can.. Can you get out from under me? Come on, try. No. No, sir. Adams! Yo! Hey, you okay? Well, I think the boy is. Aren't you, son? Yeah. I don't hurt much, but-but I can't move. Alright, alright. Just try to relax. He's gonna be fine! Gonna be alright. Hey, how about you? Well, actually, I.. I think maybe I got a little problem. What's the story? Adams is going into shock. If there's a collapse in there before the wrecker gets here you could get trapped in there yourself. What, and ruin a uniform? Never. Mister You-you know what.. You got two good legs, you can do.. 'Adams!' 'Okay, Adams!' 'You got oxygen and a blanket! Pull them in!' 'Adams!' Hey, man, you're going into shock! People die of shock! Remember that lecture you gave? Don't matter. The legs are gone. What's the matter, Adams? You afraid you'll lose your legs.. ...and wind up being a freak like your son, huh? That's what you think of your kid, right? Some kind of a crippled freak! I love my son. 'Baloney!' All that extra work, EMT classes lectures every night, huh? It's my duty. I got to train those people, to know what to do so no more kids lose their legs. 'That's a cop-out, man.' 'You're running away from something' 'you don't like to look at.' You got a son that needs you a wife that needs your support! I ain't running away from nothing! No, you're just lying there, you're giving up. Poncherello.. ...if I ever get my hands on you.. Well, you won't unless you grab that blanket and oxygen and you use it! Argh! It's gonna be okay. You got no right to talk to me like that. Hey, man, you were passing out. It made you fight, didn't it? I know what you're doing. It's not a bad technique. You sure got the mouth for it. I thought you guys were mad at each other. No, Jimmy. We're old buddies. Alright, Liotta code 4 on everything but the 11-85. 'You want a code 20?' - Negative. - '10-4.' Bobby, it's not that caves are bad but it's just that most caves are made out of big, strong rocks, right? Now, the caves that you dig, you can't dig them in rock. - Yeah. Now, any cave you dig in the dirt no matter how much fun it is eventually, it's gonna collapse just like that one did. So don't dig any more caves, alright? Okay. Jon, Ponch, come on in. Thank you. You sure it's safe? Well, I know he can't chase you out. Warren, Mike, Jon and Ponch are here with my permission. Well, well, well, look who's here. 'Yeah. But look who's pushing the chair.' What are you clowns doing here? Well, uh, we wondered why you didn't show up in court for that speeding ticket we wrote you. Because I was guilty, that's why. Look, if I admit that a couple of CHiPs knocked some sense into my head would you guys admit that I saw those two kids? Yeah, man, did you ever. How are they? Oh, they're fine, Jimmy and Bobby but they promised they'd never dig a cave again. Uh, look, I'm not really that good at saying thank you or.. You guys are alright. Did you finish that course? Of course we did. - Certified EMTs. - That's right. Hey, my dad's gonna have good legs in six or eight weeks. I mean, his own, not prothestic ones. Prothetics. Prosthetic. Prosthetic. - That's what I said. - Yeah, mom.
