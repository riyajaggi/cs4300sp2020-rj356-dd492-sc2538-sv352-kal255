 'What do you mean, you don't have any?' - It's 7 a.m.! Take the red flag off put the green flag up there and open up. Look at all these people. What are you going to do? You know, every time I think this gas crunch is getting better, it gets worse. And those guys stealing gas aren't making it any easier. Hey, looks like we may have a problem here. Maybe another victim.

 Well, I'm at work and have nothing to tell you. Income tax, that's it. Is that what you're trying to say to me? Are you trying to say that to me? Well, I've been here since 5 o' clock this morn-- - Hey, hey, hey! Settle down now. Settle down. - Settle down! Settle down. - Okay, alright, sir. Officer, am I glad to see you. Alright, I take it you're out of gas. I had a shipment due last night but they never showed up. I get here at 6:45 this morning all these people waiting, and my tanks are dry. Okay, folks, I know this is a bad scene

 but you might as well clear out. You have nothing to gain here. Come on, folks, there's a gas station open about a mile 'south of here and one east of here.' 'Give them a try, alright?' Listen, there's a gang going around stealing gas from independent stations. They didn't happen to rip you off, did they? No, no. I called the company. All their deliveries are fouled up. Okay. Loose mudguard. Take him. Call in the TC. I'll be right back. Yes, sir. - Oh, boy. We got cops coming up on us, son. I can't outrun them in this rig. Ten thousand gallons of stolen gas, Slim. Seven thousand bucks if we sell it. A felony rap if we're caught! Take the next off-ramp. Leave the rest to me. Go ahead. How bad is it, Grossie? Bruises, abrasions, minor burns maybe a slight concussion. Hey, sarge? Joe, can you hear me? Yeah. Good old Poncherello. One of the finest officers. He's delirious. Get him out of here. Any witnesses, Grossie? Long gone. But we got one thing positive the name on the tanker. "Net-oil." Big blue letters. N-E-T hyphen O-I-L. You know, something you don't realize, that cop might be dead. We ought to be back at the warehouse right now, laying low. Well, if we don't deliver this load before Beasley runs out of gas he can run us out of business. Yeah Who's going to blow the whistle? Anybody that buys gas from us is just as guilty as we are, including Karl Beasley. Right. Karl Beasley is a crook. You got to be careful with crooks, baby. They're dangerous. Sarge, Sindy's running a check on those Net-oil vehicles to make sure they're all accounted for. Yeah. They will be. If you see that truck again it won't look the same. Oh, you'll see it again. I promise you that. Be cool, Baker. I don't know whether they were trying to burn me but they sure knew I'd skid when my tires hit that gasoline. I wish I hadn't stopped for that collision. But I guess one of us had to. Better me here than you with that game coming up, huh? Can we help? It's a roller hockey match. The kids we sponsor against the west LA kids. Ever play hockey? Man you're talking to the champ. I used to be the best street hockey player in the neighborhood. What do you want, just ask? - No. You see, I was supposed to referee-- Hey, anything else, okay? But referee, no. I referee all day long out there on the streets I don't need the aggravation on my off time. Not even for the kids. Not even for a fallen comrade? Hey, no way, not me. - Let Grossman do it. - I can't! I'm a coach. I'm prejudiced. A referee must be totally impartial. I'll second that. 'Hey, Dan, how you doing?' You all know Dan Chapman. What happened? They closed down west LA? They sent me over to Central to help out for a few days. It seems like the sergeant got caught tailgating a tanker truck. Well, it's one way to get a little sack time, huh? Just dropped by to say hello. And I want you guys to know 'that although I'm serving in Central section' my heart's still in west LA with the boys. He's the west LA coach. See, we gotta replace me as referee we were thinking of Poncherello. Oh, no, no, no. Listen I got a guy. Hey, wait a minute. What's with this, "Oh, no?" I've got a impartial, even tempered rational guy in mind, alright? Yeah? Sounds like a ringer to me, sarge-- Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you implying that I cheat? You're implying I'm irrational. I was merely stating the qualifications of a man who really knows this game. Knows it? Man I practically invented it. Come on, I was playing street hockey on skates when you were still on the baby buggy. And I could've gotten out of it then and played your socks off. Boy, I'd love to give you a chance to prove that. 'But it's got nothing to do with finding a referee.' Quiet, please! All of you! Now, take your argument somewhere else, huh? Now, clear the room. We need the patient for X-ray's. 'Everyone out! Out!' You don't have to find a referee. You got one. Me. Hey, that's great, Ponch. See you, sarge. I'll get you a rule books so that you can 'study up for the big match, okay?' Uh.. See, I knew Ponch could never say no to a fallen comrade. You worried about the cops they won't be back for a while. Yeah, how long ago were they here? About an hour. Looking me over like I was Raquel Welch. Checking everybody nowadays. They check me, I'm in trouble. You this late again, I'll give you trouble. Look, I said I'd be here. I'm here. Now, the risk I'm taking, don't give me any late. You want me to buy any more gas from you you better be on time. On schedule before 7 a.m. Like we agreed. Beasley, as long as we need each other you don't scare me all that much. Neither one of us is going to do anything foolish, right? Cash. Keep 20. Spilled some. Cops against cops! Cops against cops? Roller hockey cops against cops. Would I give anything to meet Sergeant Dan Chapman one-on-one. How 'bout guys against girls? I'm talking business. You're talking recreation. Hi, Beth. Hi, Ponch. You know, it's worth the trip across town just to watch you work. Yeah, well, it must be true. I've heard it a hundred times this morning. Any problems? Yeah. What will I wear tonight? Oh, just be comfortable. We're gonna be taking in a football game. Football? I love it. Officer! Officer! Officer! Officer, I've been robbed. My gas, siphoning it right out of the tank. It was a red Camaro, uh, 146 I-L-S. Okay. Ponch! - That way. - Yeah, I'm alright. Alright. - Yeah. You better move it or by the time you back down off this truck you could be in Alaska. Alright? So move it out. Aye! Siphoning gas from a state vehicle is a heavy rap, you know that? This vehicle's not in use. Fuel in vehicles not in use, evaporates. Evaporation causes waste, okay? Hey, you're really on top of things, aren't you? Yeah, I try to. Hey, Harlan, check out my motor, would you, please? I gave it a pretty rough ride today. Yeah, I'm not surprised. Hey, Jon! 'Did you ever get a line on the truck' that did that damage to the sergeant's machine? Harlan, there was a man on that machine. Yeah, I know, Getraer! Recovering quickly or so I understand from Sergeant Chapman. Oh, yeah. I forgot about Chapman. I didn't. Hey, Harlan, uh, next time why don't you try a dash of vermouth and an olive? Irrational, huh? Beat my socks off, huh? Ha ha! Well, yeah, something like that. Uh, you know, sarge, I've been thinking-- Good. Thank you for calling it to my attention. Oh, Getraer, now him same endearing charms. What's your problem, Poncherello? Hey, no problem. Just an idea. A challenge match, roller hockey. You guys from west LA against a team of us from Central. Not the kids! Cops against cops. You got some paperwork to do? - Some, yeah. - Go do it. Well, Jon, it's just like you said. He wouldn't go for it. - Yeah. You said that the west LA Guys were, too soft. Yeah, that's what I think you said. Come in, Beth! It's open! I'll be right with you! 'Find a place for your things!' - Hi. - Hi. - Well, you look terrific. - Mm, thanks. Listen, now, you get comfortable and prepare to enjoy. You said we were going to a football game. Hey, wait a minute. I didn't say going to. What I said was, "Taking in." I don't believe in fighting traffic fighting the crowds. What I do believe in is privacy and comfort. Now, you sit down and I'll be right back. - Ta-da! - Ha ha ha! You mean the game is on TV? And we got the best seats in the stadium. Hotdogs on the stove buns in the oven and gobs of fresh, hot butter popcorns. You really make me feel like something special. Well, you are. Yeah, but, um, before we get to the hotdogs I just got to tell you we don't play favorites at the station. - Gasoline. If that's what this is all about. Beth, this has nothing to do with gasoline. We take our chances like everybody else.. - Odd. Mm-hmm. And we ask no special favors. - Right. I mean, sure helps to know when a station is opening up what time the lines starts to form. That way we get there early. Don't have to wait too long. So, we can go out where we're needed. Out on patrol. Be there at 5:30. Only because you're irresistible. Mm, salty. I was getting worried. I thought you might be asleep or something. You weren't in bed, were you? I got company, Artie. Oh, I can dig it. Listen, I won't come in. I just wanted to drop this off. A rule book? A complete guide to roller hockey. I know it's been sometime since you've played and well a bad call could cost the kids the game. Goodnight, Grossie. And remember, if you're not sure about something just look over at me. You're a real human being. Goodnight. Now, where were we? First down, goal to go. Just hold it, right there! What do you think you're doing? You weren't expecting a delivery, sir? No, and you don't deliver with a suction hose, either! I'm asking you, what are you doing? thud I told the sheriff everything I know. I've been sleeping here every night. Last night I went home for dinner. Took a nap. How much gas they get? Oh, just about 200 gallons is all. I got here just about the time they started. Look, did you notice anything special about the truck? I mean, was the rear end fire Well.. ..rear end of the truck.. That's the last thing I saw. No, no fire-blackening. Just the intake hose dragging. Spilling gas. My gas. And a mudguard missing. Mudguard? Right Yeah. Why? Uh.. In our business, we call that a clue. It's not the baby that hit Steve's car. thud The gas fumes! This car could blow any minute! Come on. His knees. Better let 'em take you to the hospital. I'm okay. It was just those gas fumes. I felt myself passing out, but, like.. ...I was paralyzed, couldn't help myself. How's my car? It's a total loss. Oh, boy. I better let 'em take me to the hospital. Didn't anybody ever tell you about carrying gasoline in your car like that? Yeah, yeah, sure. I learned my lesson. Two hits a night in a well-defined area all in county territory which means these gasoline bandits belong to the sheriff or to us. I hope you guys don't let the sheriff beat you to it. I thought you said he'd be out for a month. Well, you know me. I'm an optimist. Would you pay attention to your supervisor? Hey, watch it, sarge. You may aggravate your condition. 'Okay.' Now, there might be more trucks involved 'but there's one we can identify' 'no matter what color it is or what lettering is on it.' Chained mudguards. One missing, one new, both new. Evidence of front-end damage. And don't be impressed by authentic-looking documents. You want to take this over, sergeant? Uh, no, no. I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sick. I was thinking, though, that the, uh crooks won't hit the same station twice but, uh, I'm sure you were going to point that out. Thank you. Concentrate on the independents. 'Any dealer who's got plenty of gas' 'is either a customer of the crooks' or a guy who's going to get hit himself pretty soon. Anything else? Anybody? Yeah, they tried to rob Steve Barr's station last night and only got 200 gallons. Now, either today, tonight or maybe tomorrow morning one of the customers is going to be low on gas or run out of gas. Fine, Baker. Thank you. Now for the lighter side. How many off-duty are going to the roller hockey match? Alright, alright. As your substitute supervisor we'll all agree on friendly, fair and understanding. But at the hockey match, forget it. West LA is my team, and we're going to stomp you. Come on, give me a break. That's all. No applause. That's it. I, uh, suppose you read that rule book I gave you. Yeah. Page 18, paragraph 2, section 23. "Any attempt by a coach "to influence an official in his favor "shall result in forfeit of the game." - Mm-hmm. - Poncherello. - Yeah. If you're going to be the referee I thought you might want to glance the rule book before the match. Gee, thanks, sarge. And if during the game you have any doubts about a call just glance over at me. I'll set you straight, okay? Yeah, sure. Randy! Attaboy, Mort! Alright! Come on, Don. Good saves, good saves, Ollie! Alright, let's go, James! Good luck to you. Come on, Sean. Let's go, boy! 'Okay, Ray, come on!' 'Come on, now!' Come on, ref! Don't miss any calls, Ponch! - Hey, Ponch. - Hey! Hi, Grossie. Hey, you better keep an eye on that number eight. 'He has a tendency to high-stick a lot.' I know that kid. He's the league's leading scorer. You know that, huh? Hey, you coach, and I'll referee. I saw you giving my star player the eye. I don't want any favoritism here. - Hey, go to your bench. - Listen to me a minute-- No, coach. Here, you listen to me. Says so in the rule book. Let's go, Central! Come on! Get out there! Come on! Come on! Play some defense! - Right! Right! Right! - Woo-hoo! Let's go, guys! Alright! 'Come on! Go get them!' Hang in there, now! One minute, guys! One minute to play! Come on, now! One minute! Let's go! Alright! Okay! Way to go! High stick. No goal. No score. Hey, Ponch, what was that call? Rule book. Page nine. It was a good call. It was a good call! His stick was high. Ponch, come on, wake up. Beth is here. Beth is here Where? Come on, she's going to open up the station, alright? Good. I'm awake. There's a few things I want to say to her. Hey, Beth, you know, it's almost 7 o' clock. Yeah. Hi. That's when I open. See the sign? I asked you what time to get here so we could be at the head of the line and you said 5:30. - Right. - Well, we're here. Tell me, Beth-how many other people did you say that to, huh? I told you, all my friends. I just don't play favorites. She made a bad call. Uh, two coffees, please. 5:30! Fine thing. Hot dogs, buttered popcorn, wasted. Wasted! The stick was high. They want impartial, they get impartial. Thank you. Look at that line, two blocks long. Bad call, partner. 5:30. I mean, you can't bounce the puck for a goal, man. I don't know what Grossie's so sore about. I didn't want our kids to lose, either! Uh, Ponch, you were right there on top of the action. You made the call you believe in, right? I mean, that's over. What Grossie thinks or what I think what anybody else doesn't make a bit of difference. - Wrong. It makes a difference. 'It looks like that guy changes' 'business hours rather quickly.' 'Like, maybe he expected a delivery that didn't get there.' It's worth watching. - Hey-hey, not guilty! I've been certified to sit at my desk as of tomorrow so Dan will be going back to west LA. Oh, I hate tearful partings. About that hockey game you made a good call that cost your team at least a tie. - You showed me something. - Hear, hear. Gee, sarge, I thought you were going to say something about accepting the challenge. What challenge? Cops against cops, remember? Your west LA guys keep yelling, "We won." They didn't win. The kids won. They want to win, let them try. Them against us. Love it! I love it! Dan, that's a challenge. It could get rough. It might cause hard feelings. Hey, nobody's going to feel any worse than I have since I had to deny our kids that goal. If we could be sure of getting a fair shake. Well, it depends on the referee, sarge. You said you had someone. If I may.. ...when Ponch made that call and the kids all know it, Ponch he proved to me you can't find a better referee. Oh, no. Poncherello said he could skate my socks off. If we play...he plays. Well, then let him pick the ref! Alright. If you come up with someone we can all agree upon.. ...we accept the challenge. You got it! There you go. Oh.. ...Baker! 'I ran a check on Karl's U-serve gas station.' Shady operation. We put a stakeout on it. That was nice work. Sorry we had to miss you yesterday, Karl. In the old days, "sorry" would get you a concrete overcoat. I'll take it all. LA 15, special unit one. I think we've got a live one at my 10-20. 'Any unit in the vicinity' 'respond to special unit one's request' 'for backup at Karl's U-serve' 'Dyer Avenue at Florisande.' Special one, Mary three and four approaching on Dyer. Three miles east of you. Come in on channel two. Gary, all day yesterday I was closed. You didn't deliver, and you cost me a bundle. I'm buying you off at four bits a gallon. Slim, shut it down. Seventy cents is the price! Fifty cents or nothing! - Slim, shut it down. ' 'Yeah, he's just shutting it down, that's all.' - 'Come on, come on.' - '70 cents is the price, man.' Four bits is plenty! What the.. Hey, hey, wait a minute, you guys! Come on! Special unit one, I think the tanker's about to leave, Jon. You better crank it up. 10-4, Sindy. We'll take the truck. You take the station. How much gas did you dump? Close to 500. Okay, we got, uh...3500 left. We'll sell it at my price tonight. That rat freak. Hey. Good luck. Looks like we've got cops. Aah! Get out of here! 'Out!' Ponch, it's going to blow! Agh! - 'It's just my shoulder.' Let's get out of here. Aah! You okay? Your shoulder alright? Yeah, it's okay. No problem. Oh, come on, tell me the truth. Is the shoulder alright? You really care, don't you, huh? Of course, I care! You can't swing a hockey stick with a busted shoulder. Don't slap it! Don't slap! Trapped ball, gentlemen. Let's face it off. Follow me, please. Hey, you ain't half bad. You're pretty good yourself, ref. I think he likes your referee. They all do. Hey, that's the trouble with Beth. She's too impartial.
