 No speeders, no tie-ups, not even a flat tire. We must be in the wrong place. Nope. It's going to be a cake week. I feel it in my bones. We've only been on duty 10 minutes, and you're going to make a prediction like that? Hey, think positive. It takes a good beginning to make a good week. You probably jinxed the whole week right there. Artie, come on, man! Not on the freeway. Okay, duff bag. You're it. Real cute, Artie.

 Alan, what are you trying to do, give us a bad name? Hey, hate to tell you this, baby, but you is it! Yeah, alright. I got you, it. I might as well go along and notify next of kin. Tell me I didn't see that. Would you guys step out of your vehicles, please? Give me a minute, officer. Hold it, sir. That won't be necessary. Sir, will you stay in your car, please? Totally hand-operated. So I see. Don't get the idea that we're all crazy like that. I know better. Most of you guys have very safe records. It's just sometimes, Artie gets a little rowdy,

 and things get out of hand. Okay, Don. Everything looks in order, but I’m going to have to give you and your friends citations for what I saw-- Speeding and unsafe lane changes. You got to do what you got to do. Artie: We try to keep the game at a safe speed, officer, but when you're it, what can I say? Yeah, well, this ticket isn't going to look too good on a restricted license. Hey, I know it won't do the old record any good, but believe me, just being out there... I mean, able to get a ticket. Well, it's probably hard for you to understand. Knock it off, would you? I mean, you of all people know there's more at stake than just this ticket. Not when I’m in the driver's seat. Hey, hey, hey. Uh... I blew off a little, okay? No problem. No problem. Yeah, you could have fooled me. Just a friendly game of tag? Man, that's one hyper crew. You ever see anybody so casual about a ticket? New page in my book. You know, I’ve been thinking. Yeah? How many times have we come close to getting our own set of permanent wheels? Yeah? Uh, who was it that said positive thinking? Ha ha! Okay, okay. Let's get to work. Aah! Ha ha! Woman: First down! Nice tackle. Okay. Here we go. 26z on two. Hut, hut! Touchdown! Yay! Well, don't just stand there. You got to follow through! Keep running. Let's try it again. I got to go, dad. Hey, son, if you're going to make varsity next year, you've got to get more serious about the game, right? Honey, he's late already. Okay, okay. I've got to go, dad. If I don't leave now, I’m going to lose my route. Okay, but we start earlier tomorrow. Oh, no. No, no. You've got to get your sleep. You cannot work the night shift and stay up all day. Honey, I just don't want him to make the same mistake I did. Harry, you're doing it again. But it's the truth, isn't it? If I’d have gotten the scholarship I needed, we'd have a different setup now, wouldn't we? Oh, honey, we've gone through this a thousand times. I know. See you later, dad. Bye, mom. See you tomorrow, pal. Alright. Work those legs! Pump, pump, pump, pump! I'm getting tired of those punks using our street for a drag strip. Oh, my god. God, Kip. Are you okay, pal? My leg! Huh? My leg! Oh, son. It's his leg, babe. Call an ambulance. Take good care of him, okay? Harry, don't! Just don't worry about me. Harry?! Don't worry about me. Just call the ambulance! Honey, are you okay? Pull over! Pull that Mustang over! He hit my son! Pull over! What are you stopping me for? He's going to get away! Alright, alright. Take it easy. My son, he just got hit, a '69 blue Mustang with a crease down the passenger side. L.A. 15, 7 Mary 3. All units in vicinity of Pico and the 405, be on the lookout for a blue '69 Mustang with a crease on the passenger side. Last seen headed north on the 405. Possible felony hit-and-run. Mary 3, 15, 7 Charles. Do you have a license number on that hit? Negative, 7 Charles. You know, you would have been a lot more help to us if you'd just gotten the license number and called us. Mary 3 to Mary 4. No blue Mustang. Must've gotten off somewhere. I'll get him myself. Citizen's arrest. Hey, wait a minute! You can open yourself to a monumental lawsuit. On top of that, somebody's going to get hurt. Somebody's already hurt. I'll send a unit to get the report. Thanks a lot. Don: Alright! Hey, buddy! Remember, guys, if he won't let us spring him this time, we break both his legs, alright? Both of 'em. Alright. Huh? Ha ha ha! There he is. Hey, Brent, what's happening, huh Hi, guys. How you doing? Well, that kind of depends. Thought we'd head over to Olvera street And have some tacos and then chili daddies. I told you guys I didn't want to do that yet. Come on, Brent. We'll all go downtown to see that new space movie, alright? I don't know. Today's just not the day. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me. Come on, man. Look at me. You're going to have to face realities outside someday. Why not make it today? Come on, baby. Just sneak up on it. Go for it! Taco special. Leaving for Olvera street. Head 'em up, move' em out. Yeah. Don: Come on, come on, come on! Express train coming through here. Alan: Excuse me. Yo, lady. Whoo! Excuse me, fellows. Thank you. Oh, no. Here we go. Whoo! Excuse me. Hey, the bullfight! The bullfight! Hey! Toro, toro, toro! Andale! Andale! Alright, horny. Your turn. Aha. Aah! Alright. Whoo! Alright. Hah! Hah! Aaah! Whee. Aah! One more time to the bullfight! Yeah! Arriba! Arriba! Come on, horny. Whoo! Aah! You okay? Oh! Oh, stop. Please. Aah! Oh, stop! Oh! Oh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Hey, hey! You alright? I think so. I've heard of pickups, but this one beats them all. Man, your technique is novel. Too bad you can't keep it on the sidewalk. You guys going to show up everyplace we go? Maybe, if your luck holds out. Hey, man, if you'd let me get through the intersection, I could have straightened it all out on the other side. Save it. There you go, Artie. A little ticket for running the red light. The rest of the stuff we'll forget. A ticket in a wheelchair, man. Ain't that rich? A ticket may not be enough, Jon It just might be time to hang up his wheels. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. That ain't even funny. The point is, Artie, what are we going to do about you, man? Being disabled doesn't give you special privileges When it comes to safety. Thanks for the sermon. Come on. Move. I don't want to make excuses for Artie, But he really is one of the most helpful persons we have around here. Well, helpful isn't exactly what he is on the streets. Watch it. Reckless wheeling. Man, you could use a traffic cop around here, let me tell you. The pool is part of the corrective therapy unit here. Does everyone use it? Yeah. It's available to all the patients. We all overcompensate where we think we're weak. Physically different persons are no exception. Handicapped doesn't mean incapable, and Artie's made this his crusade. He may stretch common sense, he's a crucial inspiration to others. Where do you draw the line? Good question. So this is corrective therapy, huh? Right. Older patients use it for maintenance, but it's primarily for newer patients Who need to build up muscles they haven't used before. Come on. I'll show you one of the wards. How you doing? Alright. You see the fellow over by the window? He's relatively new. His name's Brent. Promising athlete. That wheelchair's a reality, But watching life through a hospital window Doesn't have to be. What happened to Brent? Surfing accident. He's regained the use of his arms, but he's got a motivational problem. Artie works on him every day. It's always a struggle for someone to come back to what everybody calls normal life. A lot of people can't touch a man in a wheelchair. It's like they're afraid they're going to get a disease. Coming through, coming through. Hey, hey! How you doing? How you doing? How you doing? There he is. Brent, Brent, Brent. Hey, hey. You can't hide from us, buddy. Well? Come on, man. How about it? Today going to be the big day? I have a lot of things I want to do this afternoon. Oh. Busy schedule, huh? All booked up. Yeah. Aww. Come on, man. Let's go. Hey, what'd you do to your gloves? What did he do to his gloves, he asks. Oh, nothing. Just scooped up a little fun on the way to Olvera street. I don't get it. Well, just call it one of those happy accidents. Very happy. She was a knockout, man. You should have seen her. Whoo whoo! Seems like he's got the right touch. Too bad he's a holy terror on the streets. Too bad for us, too. We'd hate to lose him. Hey, Jon Oh, man. Ha! Come on. What is this? All of a sudden, I got cops dropping out of my pockets. Hold it, Artie. Hey, listen, the only way these people are going to get the message is to be a little bit inconvenienced. Artie, I can inconvenience you $50 worth for tampering with a motor vehicle. Look, how are we supposed to get in and out of our cars if those walking dummies take up all the large spaces, huh? Jon: Oh, you mean handicapped only? Yeah. And you can be sure no para in a wheelchair is driving that roller skate. Why don't you let us inconvenience the driver, huh? Parking in the slot's a violation. I think he gets the message. Listen, to tell you the truth, we came around here hoping we could figure you out. What's there to figure out? Where is your mother? Said she'd only be a few minutes. You should have just slept until dinnertime, dad. Couldn't sleep. Haven't had a day's rest since you got hurt. Dad, it's going to be okay. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Can't play ball. There goes the scholarship, out the window. Hey, dad, what if I didn't want to, anyway? What do you mean if you didn't want to? Of course you want to. It's all we've ever talked about. Look over there. That's it! What's the matter? Get in the car! What’s the matter? That's the car that hit Kip. I know it! Then please, honey, you should call the police. Yeah, yeah. A lot they're going to do. Just-- You alright, honey? Yeah. Harry, don't you think-- Hey, you! Pull it over! What? This is citizen's arrest. Pull it over! What, are you crazy? Just pull the damn car over! Not this time, buddy. Oh, please don't. Please. Hey, dad, I don't know. I don't think it's him. Kip! Harry, come on, please. L.A. 15, Mary 5. I got a code 3, failure to yield, East on Swanson from Jefferson. Will you get off my... Pull over now! Pull that Mustang over. I want to make a citizen's arrest! That's the guy, officer. That's the guy that ran over my son. Right there. Hold it, mister, right there! Just hold it right there! I know my rights, And I demand to make a citizen's arrest now! Wait. What's he talking about? Come here. I'll show you what I’m talking about. Just come over here. Come on. Just come here. Look at that. Look at it. Is that plain enough for you? Huh? Does that convince you? I can go by the book and take this man in, but in the meantime, if you sign it, You're liable for a civil suit. Would you please let the policeman take care of it? This is the car that ran over our boy! May I see your driver's license, please? Yes, sir. Saunders, your wife is making good sense. The last thing you need now is to be sued for false arrest. Grossman: There's a lot of rust and scale on that dent. It's at least a month old if it's a day. I go to the airport a lot. That ought to be easy to verify. Fine. I got 3 cops standing around here, And nobody's on my side. What is the deal? Wait a minute. I'm only an adviser, but our computer just kicked out about 19 blue '69 Mustangs to check out. Fine. You take the other 18, But I got this blue Mustang with a scratch on the side, And I got a boy with crutches. Just tell me where to sign the thing, will you? Can you do that for me? Sir, hit-and-run with an injury's a felony, And Mr. Saunders is within his rights. I'm sorry, but I have to arrest you. Come on. I don't believe this is happening. You can't be serious. Turn around and put your hands on your head, please. Now we're getting someplace. Mister, you're going to remember this day a lot longer than I am! Oh, sure, sure. Just give me the pen. Thank you very much. Come on. Hey, Artie, I sure hope Brent appreciates this. Ow. Mmm! Don't worry about that. Did you hurt your wittle hand? Yeah, a little bit. If I can get this rocket basket to work, believe me, He's going to appreciate it. Artie, are you sure this thing's street legal, man? That ain't my problem. I wouldn't be so sure. Ah, what now? Officers, to what do we owe the pleasure of this visit? We're looking into a hot wheelchair ring-- 3 guys. The leader's kind of a-- How should I put it? A hotdog. Yeah, a hotdog. That's very funny. We got a break time, and we figured We'd come by and see if we can clean up any hard feelings. What do you say? We ain't got no hard feelings. You don't believe that, and neither do I. Come on, man, we're trying, eh? Alright, I know my head trip on the road... It is kind of a problem. Alan: You know, wait a minute. Look. I'm not trying to make any excuses for anything, you know, but it took me a lot of confidence to get back on the road. I guess maybe now I got a little bit too much confidence for my own good. I guess I-- I should watch overdoing it with the wheels. Hey, uh--Excuse me-- Those are designer. Alright! We all kind of put in our two cents' worth.  It's a surprise for Brent. You think it'll do the trick? We figure if we give him something too hot to use on the inside, the man's got to come outside. He's got to open it up. Sneaky devils, ain't we? Yeah. Old Brent, he's a hard case, huh? No. Um...I was the hard case. Hey, if it wasn't for Artie here, man, I wouldn't be driving and holding a job or nothing. Hey, hey, hey, enough already, huh? Somebody call the cops here? Oh, that's our boss. Hey, what's happening, sarge? I thought you'd like to know the boys have narrowed down the field on your Saunders hit-and-run. 3 primaries, and one glows in the dark. '69 light blue Mustang, 783-Ocean Paul David. Jerry Parker-- A dozen outstanding warrants for moving and parking violations, driver's license suspended. No address? Parker's been derelict in reporting his whereabouts for the past 18 months. In other words, all we have is a '69 light blue Mustang That's dented with 783-OPD license plates. That's more than we had before. Yeah. Thanks. Sarge, this is Artie, Don, and Alan. Hey, sergeant. How you doing? We got to be moving, alright? Thanks for stopping by. Nice to have met you. See you. Harry: Doesn't look too bad. Kind of beat up, though, isn't it? Kip: yeah. Well... Get that thing off here. It'll be ready when you are. That leg's got a lot of catching up to do, though, pal. I talked to coach Howard today. Yeah? Good. What'd he say? Tell me, son. There's no way I can be ready for junior varsity, And he says it's not fair to the other guys to save a place for me. But if you don't play J.V., You got no chance for varsity. Sorry, dad. We'll just have to try to catch up. We can do it. You got to stand up and take control Because nobody's going to help you but yourself. You remember that. Yeah, I know, but-- No buts about it. Fix this bike. It's bent all to pieces here. When I get into a lot of paperwork, I start dreaming in triplicate. Congratulations. Do you write them down? Really. You should. A dream journal's a great way to get in touch with your subconscious. Thanks, Grossie. I'll sleep on it. Ha ha ha! Baker, Poncherello, there's a Harry Saunders out front to see you. I imagine you know what it's about. 10 to 1 he's been served already. That guy he arrested had his case put together even before we booked him. He's out for blood. So how come they couldn't put it in plain English, huh? It's pretty plain. The man you arrested has rights, too. He's ordering you to court to show sufficient cause why you should not be sued for false arrest. How come? Because his lawyer won't have any problem proving that his client's car couldn't be In two places at the same time. So what do we do now? We don't do anything. We can't advise you as legal counsel. But I’ll tell you something off the record. If I was you, I’d drop the charges and hope to settle out of court. Hey, Poncherello, it's for you on line two. Says it's important. Hello? I just wanted to check. You guys still looking for that blue Mustang, 783 You are, huh? Ha ha. Yeah, well, you can pick it up in a parking lot just off of Third and Arizona. It ain't going anywhere. Hey, thank you. Bye. Mr. Saunders, I don't know if this is going to help you. Artie and the guys located Jerry Parker's car. This may be the one that did hit your kid. Good luck. Ah! Ha ha. Whoa! Your style is impeccable. Whoo! Hey, man! Listen, now, I can't speed. Hey. Hey, I’m talking to you! You see anybody mess with my car? Come on, man, who'd want to mess with that heap? Hey, gimp, give me a straight answer. Help the man out. What'd he look like? Tall, man, real tall, had a beard. No, he didn't have a beard. He had a mustache. He needed a shave, though. I know that. No, he was short fellow. But he didn't mess with your car. Cut the smarts, jack. L.A. Mary 3. Request backup. We're just trying to be helpful. That's right. Felony hit-and-run on foot, Third and Arizona. Come on, man, there's your rabbit! Hey! What about your car? Alright. Now you get your picture taken for free. Come on out. Turn around and put your hands on your head. Dispatcher: 1179 westbound Santa Monica freeway... D.A.'s going to have a good time with him for a while. I thought you guys were never going to get here. How'd you stall him? You run a pretty slick operation. Thanks for the tip. Pays to have friends. Officer, I’ll be your friend anytime. Me, too, honey. I second that one. Well, duty before pleasure. I think she likes me. Jon: The similarity between the cars is obvious, and there's no doubt that Mr. Saunders was in the wrong. Therefore, you have the right to press your case. On the other hand, I wish you'd remember that Mr. Saunders' son had just been run over. Hearts and flowers. Violins. Don't listen to him. Bonnie called from downtown. Said Parker's making a full confession. Mr. Saunders, this is Mr. Stevens, Mr. Delgado's attorney. How you doing? Well, looks like I made a mistake. Stevens: A big one, Mr. Saunders. My client's vehicle can be documented to be in L.A. Airport parking lot number 4 at the time your son was hit. And we'll also supply the court with proof that that crease was 5 weeks old at the time. Maybe you didn't hear me say that Parker's downtown making a full confession. Fine. Then there's nothing to contest. We'll submit, and we'll wait for judgment. I am sorry about all this. Delgado: Sorry? Mister-- I advise against this. I was booked, I was arrested, I was treated like a criminal. I had to call my family from jail. You have no idea what you put me through! Jon: Mr. Delgado, I’m sure you're right about that, but on the other hand, there's no way of you knowing how  Mr. Saunders felt, either. I am sorry about your son. Thank you. This is just a thought, but perhaps you should compensate Mr. Delgado for what it's cost him so far. You have an airtight case. His loss of time and his attorney fees. If I could float a loan, uh... I'll send you a bill. I suppose I ought to thank you guys And be real happy, right? It's better than going to court. Never would have happened if I’d have kept my eye on the right car. Hey, Brent, what's happening? Man, today is going to be the day. Oh, yeah. What's the deal? Oh, oh. Don: Excuse me. Got a brand-new set of wheels for you. Alan: And the only way that you're going to open it is for you to go outside. Artie: That's right. And we ain't taking no for an answer. That's why we brought along the cops. Alan: That's right. Hi. They call me Jon How do you do? Ponch. Hi. What a production. There's a whole world waiting for you out there. And besides, with this super-deluxe chair, you may get picked up by this neat-looking C.H.P. lady. Oh, yeah. Come on, buddy, you can do it! Come on, Brent! You can do it, Brent! Alright! Artie: Hey, Brent! Hey! Alright! Alright! Look at this guy! How's that sun feel, man, huh? Remember the sky, huh? Look at it. Looks nice, don't it? Isn't it great? How about that? How about that chair? Huh? Alan: Ha ha ha! I love it! I love it! Alright, man. Yeah! Alright. Alright. It's nice. It works okay. Hey! Down to the next light. If you're not careful, you're going to put Brent back in the hospital again. You don't do that again. Oh, yeah? Watch me. Is it hurting you, pal? Nah. Okay. Here. Let me get this. Will you take my crutches, dad? Sure. Easy now. That-a boy. No mistakes this time, buddy boy. Dad, don't! Honey, don't. Pull over! Pull over! Hey, man, I’m sorry. See you around. Hey, Artie, this guy's crazy, man! Don't worry about a thing. Old Artie’s got it all under control. Hey, hey, Artie! Slow down! 15-7 Adam. Pursuing two street racers eastbound on Culver from 26. Failure to yield. Dispatcher: Any units positioned, 15-7 Adam is in pursuit of two street racers eastbound Culver from 26. Take the van. Watch out for that wire! Artie: I’m okay. Get the guys in the back. Artie. Don: Is he okay? You alright? He's alright. It's alright. Hey. It's alright. I'll take care of you. Get him up a little bit. It's alright, Brent. Come on, man. Come on. Alright. Hey, Brent’s out, you guys. Brent's out. It's alright. You alright? Yeah. Honey, what's the matter? I broke my leg. Oh... but you're okay. I don't know what's wrong with me anymore. I'm just so angry at everything. Things are going to get better, dad. We'll work extra hard. I bet you I can get a replacement spot on the J.V. Squad. Ah, son. Only if you want to, buddy. There's more to life than pleasing your old man, you know. I got a lot of work to do on myself. Oh. It'll be alright. It's his right leg. He thinks it's broken. Ah! Broke both arms. Artie: Uh-huh. Alright, Poncherello, Just keep those pearls of yours covered up. I overcompensated trying to prove something. I know. I know. Maybe something did get proved. Come on, Artie. You got to come out sooner or later. It's like you always said, the first step is always the hardest. Artie: Okay, Harry. Hey! Alright! Hey, hey! Hey, what do you say? Snowman in a chair. Got to hand it to judge Haverly. This is pretty creative, huh? Yeah. He gets the use of my arms till he gets his back. Sounds like justice all the way around. Let's go out and have some fun, some pizza. Huh Watch out! Hey, hey! Hey. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
