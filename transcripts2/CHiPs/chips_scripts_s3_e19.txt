 Great love story, Jon. Handsome highway patrolman finds beautiful childhood sweetheart. Man, that's romance. Hey, listen, Ellen Roberts is a great lady but she's not my childhood sweetheart. I meant Lisa and me. Lisa and you? You only met Lisa last week. Yeah, but she must have been somebody's childhood sweetheart. Hey, what are you doing? Your car's parked in a tow-away zone.

 - Uh, no, it's my boyfriend's. Uh, look, I'll, uh.. ...I'll call him and he'll move it. I'm afraid that's a little late. The police have already tagged it. See the ticket? You pay the impound fee, and you get your car back. But there must be something I can do. Call this one in and then I'm going to pick up Marla. You tell Howard one more car.. ...and that is all. I'm wrecked. Am I bleeding? Oh, God, I'm bleeding.

 I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding. Feeling better, sir? Better? I'm bleeding to death. That's not blood, sir. That's, uh, tomato juice. Well, why am I lying here? You fainted. Hey, hey, but they are taking my car. We'll get you a ride, okay? May I have my blanket? Oh. Daddy, did we miss the job? I'm afraid so, honey. 'Marla had a half-day session. I had to pick her up at school.' Tomato truck's all that's left. That might take a heavy-duty rigger. Sorry I made you late, daddy. We need the bread. Honey.. ...maybe I'll have a big weekend. I wish you didn't have to work every weekend. Daddy, you need time off. Sweetheart.. ...if I can pay a few more bills then I'll take a lot of time off and we'll do it together, alright? - Okay. - Okay. Hey, listen, I'm taking Ellen and Chris on a picnic tomorrow. Maybe Marla would enjoy meeting Chris. What's Chris? A boy? Yeah. Yuck. Hey. - Hey, Ponch. - Hey, you're late. We've been trail riding for a half hour now, right? Marla Baldroff, this is Ellen Roberts. Hi, Marla, we've heard a lot about you. This is my son, Chris. Hi...so, what's happening? Your helmet's too big. You ride? Not on toys. You okay, tiger? Yeah, no biggie. I guess he was showing off or something. Little kids do that. Well, you know something? Big kids do too, for pretty girls. What should I call you? Well, Ellen will do fine. Are you and Jon a thing? We're just good friends. - This is my dad. - Oh. So that's where you get your good looks. My mom was pretty, too. My dad is neat. He's strong. By the way, he owns his own truck. And he's in really good health. And he's really good with kids.. ...especially boys. - Hey, that's nice work. - Thanks. - You only got three to go. This is it. I told you, I'm done. Uh, Mr. Howard don't think so. Hey, Danny boy. Julian tells me there's three more cars. Oh, yes, that's to close our account. Hey, our account is closed. Now, I just brought in my last payment. You forced me into this. I did what I had to do. I am finished. Sorry. Danny, we all lose loved ones. You lost your wife. You came to me just as they were about to take everything that you owned to satisfy your hospital and funeral bills. You made your choice then. Am I right? We had a deal. Interest by the month Ten hot cars to pay off the principle, right? Your interest payments were late three times. Now, uh.. ...lenders charge for tardiness. I'm a businessman. You're a car thief and a lousy loan shark. Hey, you better watch your mouth. 'Julian!' That's not necessary. Danny, three more cars, you're free and clear. I'll, uh, sign off your note and I'll have no need for these.. ...anymore. Come on, kids. Food's ready. This is my very best day ever. Yeah? Well, it's mine too, pal. Ooh-ooh. Okay, tiger? Uh, let's just say "it's no biggie, huh?" Attaboy, help me up. Kiss my mom. What's wrong? Can I guess? I worry about my dad when I don't know where he is. Okay? About our date, Lisa.. ...how is it if you go meet Jon and Ellen at the Starwood? I'll come as soon as I can. Well, it's kind of a custody problem. Here's your drink, Ponch. - Hey, thank you, doll. - You're welcome. Huh? Oh, just a soft drink. Lisa, would I lie to you, huh? Yes, it's a girl. It's Marla. Lisa-Lisa! Lisa! 'This is Big-D to Fireball.' 'Big-D to Fireball. Come in.' Daddy! This is Fireball to Big-D. Daddy, are you okay? Just fine, honey, fine. Look, call Mrs. Bevits and you wait for me there, alright? Come back. Daddy...I'm with Ponch. I'm okay here. Okay? Yeah, yeah, that's-that's good. You're in good hands. You stay with Ponch. 'It's like having police protection. Come in.' Danny, umm, everything is cool. Go. Yeah, yeah, fine, look, I don't mean to hang up on you so quick but would you put Marla back on? Come in. Daddy.. Excuse me, Ponch. 'Daddy, please hurry home.' That's a big 10-4, baby. You know that pretty dre.. Look, I got to go. Bye. Talkin' to your kid again, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah, kids are nice. She is. Now, I want the Porsche and two more like it.. ...and you'll probably get home before something bad happens to her. Things happen, you know? Only difference between this and other gangs stealing luxury cars is their "no parking" ploy. It's a hoax to fool the witnesses. Therefore, we have no good ID, no solid leads. Listen, I got to go in there to a meeting and I'm late. And the man in there is a monster. A monster? Yeah, so you wait in here. 'Well, hey, I don't want him to know about you' because he might fly into a rage. He sounds corny. So watch for temporary tow-away posters that don't belong. Okay, that's it. 'Hey, look at this.' Thanks for the truck. It's out back. Yeah, why'd you need the truck? Bring my motor to work. Had to bring Marla too. - Spent the night with her. See you later, Jon. Hey, Frank. Uh.. Used to be the gun locker, sarge, huh? Yeah, well, we changed the gun locker last year. Oh, time flies. Hmm, briefing flew right by you. Oh, uh, flat tire. Hmm. Uh, hello. Who are you? I don't know if I should say. You aren't the monster, are you? Uh, what monster's that? The one Ponch told me about. Aha. Uh, yeah, that would be me. My boyfriend's new T-Bird. I've been to the city and the county. Uh, they can't find it anywhere. The driver was, uh, youngish and he-he was nice looking. 'He had blue eyes.' California Highway Patrol. One moment, sir. Ponch, call for you. Line 5. Your friend Danny Baldroff he must know every tow truck in town. I thought maybe if she talked to him he might come up with something. Uh, yeah. You said you'd be back this morning, Danny. Where are you? I'm still in Ventura. My truck broke down. Look, can you pick her up from school this afternoon? I can be there tonight but I know she'll be in safe hands with you. Uh, Marla's been wondering, uh, are you okay? No, I'm fine. You tell her not to worry. I'll see you later. Yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you, Mrs. Bevits, bye. Danny, you're anxious to finish this, I know. It's just, uh, it's taking longer than we expected. Why don't you sleep here? Julian will keep you company. Surely...your daughter can wait until.. ...the last car is in. Bonnie. Bonnie! Hey, you're not only the prettiest cop I know but you always show up at the right time. And this is a very small favor. 'Can you get the little girl from the ladies lounge' 'and drop her off at school please?' See, because you're in a car and I'm on a motor and I can't do it myself. And one day, I'll do a big favor for you, huh? Yeah, okay. What little girl? Well, the one.. She's.. Where is she? Uh, the monster's got her. Oh, boy. Ponch, he didn't fly into a rage. Well, there's still time, honey. Hi, I'm Bonnie. Hi. Let's avoid the fallout. But...but where's my dad? Um, he called, um, he's fine, uh, after school, okay? - Okay. - Come on. - Uh-- - Uh-uh, about, my flat tire. Yeah, yeah, I know. It's a-it's a cover story. You're working on a case. I'm afraid I am. 'Hey, Danny boy, come here.' What's this? You're supposed to be in Ventura. See, this way they don't see you in your truck. And this one's got everything. Except a radio. And we don't need that anymore, do we? Hey, over here! Come on, over here! Over here! 'Come here!' Get the flaghorn now. Hey, Ponch, give me a hand. You gotta get up here before this thing explodes! Get a crowbar and a fire extinguisher. License plates on your green tow truck, uh.. ...DMV says 1-Apple-8-5-5-85 was retired with a bakery truck that was wrecked 6 months ago. Looks like your tow truck was hot. Could be reason enough for failure to stop. Want me to follow through? No, that's alright. We got to go back and clean up. We'll write it up. Alright. So maybe it wasn't Danny, Jon. Yeah. His truck is white, and that was a green one. He's supposed to be in Ventura, so.. So maybe it wasn't Danny. That's supposed to be a flaming ring of fire but my mom won't let me have any matches. Marla's welcome to stay with us until her father gets home.. ...from his business trip. Here comes Marla's run. 'She's going around the curve.' 'She's going around. She's really going.' 'Yes, siree.' 'Boy, is she going good.' 'She's going around the curve again.' 'Oh, she's going.' 'Oh, she almost stopped, but she's still going.' 'Go on around.' Doin' great, babe. What's this? T How about a dress, girl? Dresses bore me. Hey, guys like to see girls in dresses especially at parties. It's not my party, anyway. Well, I'll tell you what why don't we make it a welcome home party for you and your dad? Then why do I have to pack a bag? Well, because you might stay over at my place. Ponch, are you jiving me? Hey, I might jive you but I don't think your dad would. And he said he'd be back tonight. If I have an avocado, some onion soup, some cream cheese some garlic and parsley, I can make a real neat party dip. Well, hey, write that down, lady. Come on. How'd you know how to do that? I cook for my dad all the time. Are you going steady? No. Are you kidding? Boys aren't all bad. I know. But, see, I got to help my dad whenever I can. Girls aren't all bad, either. Thanks a lot. I don't mean you. You, I like, even with a dress on. I'm too old for you, Chris. Hey there, how about a chip, huh? No, thank you. Come on, I'll fix you a Shirley Temple. - I sure could use one. - Come on. Is she a pawn in some kind of game? Well, that's one way to put it, yeah. Is she in danger? Well, that depends what the game is. Until now, we really don't know. But she's where she belongs. Excuse me. Hello. Danny. Yeah. May I speak to Marla, please? Yeah, okay, I dig you can't talk right now but you find a way to contact us, you hear? I want to know what's going on before you hurt this little girl. Marla, it's your dad. He's fine. Daddy, we're having a party for you. Pumpkin, I-I can't come. You know these repo jobs. If I don't get the car that they send me for I don't get paid. But, daddy.. ...you've been gone a long time. Okay, daddy. I love you too. Hey, Marla, you didn't bring any PJ's or a nightgown. You knew before that he wasn't coming, right? Wrong. I had you pack a bag just in case. I wish I was there to help him. Then he wouldn't be having any trouble. Yeah, but then, you would have missed the party and we would have had no avocado dip. So, come on, princess, brush your teeth and I'll find you some kind of nightgown, huh? Come on. Ponch? What What? I forgot my toothbrush. Oh, that's no problem. Alright, let's see what we have. New toothbrushes? Yeah, brand new. Never been used. Here, pick one. How come you have so many new toothbrushes? Never mind. Come on. Here, let's see. Now.. ...here's a nightgown. Ponch, do I have to? Yes, and get to sleep. Hey, what's wrong? I'm scared. Come on. There we are. Come on, sweetheart. There you go. Alright, listen. Now, after school, you look for your dad or Jon or Ellen or me. Nobody else, okay? What if he tries to get me at the house on the CB? Well, if he can't get you he'll try to get us. Don't worry, now, alright? Go get dressed for school now, okay, Chris? The brown pants. Has she had any breakfast? I got to tell you, she knew we had to be at work at 6:30 this morning. She was up at 5:00, cooking bacon and eggs. Does her father know how lucky he is? I mean, how can he leave her like this? Uh, Ellen, look, Danny might be making some big mistakes right now, but he loves Marla. From things he said, we think that's part of the problem. I'll see you later, okay? Okay. Well, one of the boys found a convertible that should fit our need. Or use my truck. Huh, no way. Hey, you foul up again today I want a chance of getting away. I mean, what good does it do me to get out of trouble with you guys if I get caught by the law? Couldn't win a turtle race in that heap. Use his. They're probably still looking for the green one. Mr. Howard, it's only five blocks from where he lives. Yeah, I know, uh, just watch him very carefully. Mom, my bike's gone. Getraer. Roberts? Okay. Uh, good morning. Sergeant Getraer. Sergeant, it's Ellen Roberts. 'Want me to come back.' Fireball to Big-D. Fireball to Big-D. 'Please come in. Over.' Fireball to Big-D. Daddy, won't you answer me? 'Please, daddy, come in. Over.' Hold it, Baldroff. I told you, no more calls. 'This is Fireball. Please come in, daddy.' Now, I told you about my daughter. That's my last car, Julian. You haul it. Hey, Baldroff. Hey, I told you to get back in the truck. I told you to get back in the truck. In little pieces? You want to do a number for the neighborhood? 'Please, daddy, come in. Over.' Fireball to Big-D. Fireball to Big-D. Daddy, please, please just answer me. Daddy! 'This is Fireball to Smokey.' Someone stole my daddy's truck. A big man! Smokey! Smokey! Someone stole my truck. I need you, Smokey! 'Fireball, this is Smokey. Fireball, this is Smo..' Hey, kid. Help! 'Mary-4, 7-Charles, do you copy?' Mary-4, Bonnie. I picked up a CB call for help named Fireball. I think it's little Marla Baldroff. Okay, Bonnie, we're on our way. Help! Where's Marla? Where's your truck? - I-I-I just got here. - Bike's out back. 'She also called for Smokey.' She called for help, Danny. She said your truck was stolen. 'A big man.' He came here. Quit stalling. Let's have it! He must have taken her. Howard Wrecking, 15-201 East Commerce. What's the matter? Where's Danny? He split. Something went wrong. I don't know, the wheels froze. All I know is I had to get here. Well, once you tow it into the garage we'll see what's wrong with it. Danny's kid. She must have called the cops. What do you want to do? Don't stand there with the toy. What do you want to do? Julian, why don't we hide it in one of those piles over there and we can get it down later? Yeah, yeah. Julian, if they are coming here, um.. ...I'll do the talking. You don't say anything. Help. Help. Help! Help! Help! Help! Jon, the car. She's in the car! Help! Rope! Help! Hang on, Marla! Just hang on! Daddy, help me! Honey, I'm coming. Just stay there! Ponch, help me! Daddy, help me! 'Hurry, Ponch, that cable could break any second!' Put your arms around my neck. Okay, here we go. You're going to be fine. Daddy, I just wanted to see where he was taking your truck. I called and called. Where were you? Look, I'm back, I'm here and I'll never let it happen again. She's just got a little bump on her head. Why don't you have Bonnie take care of her? Uh, come on, honey. I have some medicine in my car. I'm not going to put the handcuffs on you while Marla's watching. That's alright, I.. ...caused enough trouble already. Where are you going to keep her while I'm locked up? Uh, we'll take her to Ellen Roberts' house. I don't think Chris would ever forgive me if we didn't. - Yeah. Thank you. Well, now, how are we going to get that car down? No problem.
