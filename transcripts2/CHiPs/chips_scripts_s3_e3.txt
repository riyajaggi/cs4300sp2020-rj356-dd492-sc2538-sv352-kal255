 Watch and learn. ♪ Dance ♪ Dance like a spinnin' top ♪ ♪ Dance ♪ Dancin' around the clock ♪♪ Nothing to it. Well, looks like they're gonna have some fun getting outta there. Ah, who cares, man? Look at those coyotes. It's got to be a valley van. Awooo! Hey, come on, you guys. Pull up and give them some room. Hey, what's the matter with you? Come on. Let's go check out the afternoon glass. Looking good, baby. Looking good. Hey, wait for me! Ooh! You see that guy go under? Man, a guy could get killed. Yeah, It's no great loss, man. Who needs those guys? Hey, look at this, man. What a bummer! We'll never get out of here. Well, it's a popular spot. Maybe it was the only place left. Oh, man. Look, there's lot of spaces left, man. They just did it for the grins. They're those stupid surfers, man. They think they own the whole beach! What are we gonna do now? Just load up and get in, alright? Here, Ramon. Start it up. 'Yeah.' You can't do.. What you gonna do? Hit it! Hey! Come on, Ramon! Come on! Let's go! Get out of here, man! They're coming! Come on! Hit it! Darn vals! Back to the valley, chumps! Oh, man! Hey, come on, man, let's go teach those vals to stay where they belong. Damn! Hey, go, man! I think they're catching up, man! Hey, man, why don't you just pull over and talk to them, man? It was an accident. You think they're gonna believe that, huh? Michael, slow down. Go, man! Yahoo! Hey, pull over! Pull over! - Oh, yeah. Sure. This is all I needed, a stiff neck and a-a rolling smorgasbord. Okay. I'll be right with you, alright? What was that guy doing? I mean, he was on my side of the road. LA-15, 7 Mary 3. Advise West valley to be on the lookout for a brown decorated Chevy van. Possible 215. Heading east on Ansenook Canyon road. How about that? Those suckers got away. Never mind them. You got problems of your own. Excessive speed.. Around blind curves.. Over the double yellow line. Hey, man, they busted out my headlights! Doesn't that count for anything? No excuse for endangering lives and property.. ...driving like a wild man. Hey, those valley punks are always coming over here and doing stuff like that. Can the feud jive, man. I got a flash for you. The beach is for everybody. Yeah. Whatever you say, sir. But, you know it's those vals who've been ripping off all the tape decks around here. Maybe, and maybe not. You know, you guys got it lucky. You live out here. Some people don't have it so good. - Ah, now I get it. - Come on, Jer. Hey, it's true. He probably even knows them. Now, just what exactly are you gentlemen trying to say? You know, we know where you're coming from. You're just looking out for your own. Protecting lives, pal, yours, theirs, everybody's. Now, okay, okay. Hey, listen, next time. Those vals aren't the only ones who can understand turf. The turf you better worry about is the kind you could be 6 feet under at the rate you're going. Here. Now, you hear me well. Leave the pursuits to us, and you cool down that attitude. You're lucky you're only gonna be paying fines. Next time...and if there is a next time.. ...you may all end up in jail. I don't know what gets into people out here. What happens to logic, courtesy, caution? Oh, come on. Only a few of them get outta line. And you can't blame them for liking the beach. Cheap entertainment. Mostly good, clean fun. Hey, I don't mind them coming down here all day long. What gets me is they all want to go home at once. How's it going? Pretty well, except we're hearing a lot of "them" and "us" talk. You know, like the Beach-valley feud is heating up again. Well, that's too bad, but I can't think of anybody better equipped to handle it than you guys. Hey, we're not the UN, sarge, you know? No, just cops who are here to maintain peace and safety for everyone, right? That's one way to put it. You may find things getting a trifle dull. I'm informed there's a CB and tape-deck rip-off ring that's mining the beachgoers. 34 hits yesterday alone. 'Stuff's showing up in swap meets' 'all the way from Oxnard to San Diego.' We're hoping we can pinch the fence before we bust the source. Will you keep your eyes on business? Never mind the scenery. Oh, no, sarge. It's business first with them. They care about our image. I hope so. See you later. Ha ha ha! Well, thanks for the warning, officer. - Uh, no more-- - Failure to signal. Yeah. Right. Uh, failure to signal. Did you say you were a tennis instructor? Uh, yeah. Do you play? Keep a straight line on your arm. You want to try? Sure. This time, I wanna ride, I want the white one because the last time, you took the yellow-- No. I'm sorry about that. I'm lucky when I get that. Donna, guess what. I'm not in the mood for guessing games, Kris. Stop the car! I can't! Next time, I'm letting the garage do my brakes. Hold on! I'll help you! What's your problem? - No brakes! - Nothing! Turn off the ignition! Downshift! Now second! First! Put it in first! Hold it there! Get back! Get back! My brakes failed. No wonder. Overloaded, huh? Thousand pounds or so. May I see your driver's license, please? I'm sorry. Waiting for an ambulance to take a couple of pretty ladies like you to emergency... that's sorry. It won't happen again, I promise. Cross my heart. Me, too. Nice cats. They look fast. Yeah. Super fast. You sail, too? Sure. Speed's only half of it. Working the wind is the real charge. Yeah. Leaning way out having the ocean ripping by...love it. Don't you love the salt spray caking your body? I never get enough of it. Well, if you get some time, why don't you look us up? When? I wish it were right now. Sorry, right now, I'm giving you a written warning for having defective brakes. Well.. You can look us up anyhow. Thank you. I will. Ought to be easy to learn. Oh, no. I'm so glad we finally got here. I thought we'd never get here. Boy, the water looks good, doesn't it? Hey, let's sit here, man, huh? Okay. Right here? Alright. Somebody want to give me a hand? Thanks. Hey, Lupe. - Nothing, man. I'm just checking things out, you know, man? Hey, listen, don't worry about it. We got as much right to this beach as anybody else does. Come on. Here you go, Lupe! Alright! Hey, let's play! Righteous sets, man! Whoo! Yeah. You want to take a run up the county line? Yeah. That'd be cool. Hey, guess who forgot the rules again? Yeah. That's them, alright. I guess now it's our turn. Ah, you guys, they put down a lot of money for this paint job. Who cares, man? They gotta learn sometime. Hey, this little picnic isn't gonna turn out quite like they expected. Get ready. Alright, man. Do your stuff. Come on, man. Let's go. Okay. Hey, amigos! Time to pack it up! Come on, Dave! Get in! Hey, amigos! Yeah! Game's over, blondie! You guys! Wait up! 15 Mary 5 in pursuit, two reckless vehicles 'northbound PCH at morning view.' Okay. Ma'am? Could you take it left, right away, please? Thank you very much. Thank you. Come on. Here we go. Okay. Let's go. Put your hands where I can see them. Come on. Is he alright? If he wasn't, what good would it do to ask? Listen, I'm sorry. Not half as sorry as your back pocket's gonna feel. Hey, man, they thrashed our van! Why don't you just look at it? The surfers wanna mix, we'll mix. No, you won't. You're gonna cool it right now, all three of you! Hey, look who you're talking to, man. You're one of us! Hey! Don't lay that brother trip on me. Not in the middle of this and not when you almost got us killed. But it wasn't our fault! You know what's coming down here. I already told you, that isn't gonna work. One more word out of you and you're on your way to jail. Tape-deck thieves haven't kept anybody home. Yeah, well, nobody ever thinks it's going to happen to them. Tell me something, Jon. If you were gonna rip off 34 tape decks in one day.. ...how would you do it? I guess I'd want a cover that'd take me anywhere without anybody stopping to give me a second thought. Let me buy you an ice-cream cone. Got the munchies, huh? - Uh, let's see. How about two strawberry galacticas? Two strawberry galacticas, comin' up. Oh, there you are. That'll be a buck. - Thank you. - You bet. The only thing hot there is the hot fudge... for the sundaes. Yep. Nice try. Not bad, either. Listen, uh, you know, a lot of these trucks work the beach, you know that? Hey, Michael, give me the keys. I'll make a food run. Why don't you get me a coke, okay? - Okay. Okay, okay. Everybody gets a coke. Hey, babe, how about rubbing some oil on my back, huh? Okay. Where do you want it? How come you don't do that to me? Aw, man. Shoot. 'Hey!' Hey! We've been ripped off! Wow! Look at that set! Yeah. Hey, look! She's got one, man! Go for it! - Yeah! - Alright! Hey, look at her. 'Whoo! Yeah!' 'Alright!' 'Get down! Whoo!' Hey, look. Yeah. 'Looking good.' Hey! Come on! They got our boards! Look out! Aah! Aah! Aah! You alright? Stay there. Help's on the way. Take the traffic, Bonnie. What happened? The kite. I couldn't see. Okay. Just please stay right here, would you? Stay right here, alright? It wasn't our fault. These boys running with surfboards knocked me down. We did try to grab the string but the people chasing them got in our way. You mean, uh, one group was chasing another? That's right, and when they heard the crashes the boys with the boards dropped them and the other boys ran away with them. The ones with the surfboards.. ...they took off in a, an old ambulance. Here you go, sweetheart. Uh, we know those boys. We're sorry this happened, alright? Hey, Baker. Looks like things are escalating. I think it's time we apply a little diplomacy. Yeah. We got the day off tomorrow. I think it's time for our summit. Well, what do we have this morning? Tofu frappe with primary yeast and two eggs thrown in for good measure. Ha ha! Ahh! I feel a record-breaking day coming on. Good. The boys from Oxnard radioed down. They can take every unit we can get our hands on. Hot dog! There's going to be a big crop at Zuma today. Fantastic. You know, I think we oughta franchise this cover. Ha ha ha! Yeah. "You, too, can make big money by just blending in." We ought to advertise, put it on matchbook covers. Ha ha ha! You know, since we started investigating your ice cream hunch, I think I've put on about ten pounds. I say tomorrow we start checking out pizza trucks, huh? Aw, Ponch, come on. I.. valley people has arrived. Straight ahead. Glad you guys came. You didn't give us much of a choice. Hey, you didn't give us much of a choice, either. Where are your friends the, uh, the water babies? So...we're here. So, everybody's been pretty lucky up until now. But, you know, you guys can either walk away from this knowing that everything's gonna be alright.. ...or somebody's gonna get hurt, and bad. Now, what's going on, huh? - Hey, there's no problem. Okay, man. What are you dummying up for? Yeah, you know, it insults our intelligence. Hey, they ripped off our tape deck, man! Ah, no way! These chumps ripped off our tape deck last week! That's bull, man! Hold it, guys. Hey, I got news for you.. It was a pro outfit. And frankly, I don't think you dudes got the talent to pull off a marathon job like that. Okay, man. I'm going to tell you in words you can understand. 'It's simple, turf.' Everybody's got their turf. Yeah. You've got yours, and we got ours. You're telling me, you own the whole ocean? Well, I think you're crazy, man. Oh, yeah, man, and you own the whole valley, right? Hey, man, we got some nice railway yards. Why don't you come on down? They're making a lot of progress, huh? Hmm, yeah, like a herd of turtles. Okay, okay, man. Big deal. Hey, look, you wanna try a good stick? It's simple, all you got to do is get out there and pretend like you know what you're doing. That's what we do. Hey, all it takes is a little guts. Go ahead, man. We could take care of this right here and now, you know? Yeah. Maybe somebody will break a neck. Hey, man. Come on. It's simple. Yeah. Be my guest. I guess you could call that a start but, uh, they'll probably try to drown each other. Hey, hey, hey, Jon. Lifeguards we're not. I think we've done all we could do, alright? 'Hey, guys!' Ahoy! Hi! Come on over. Ooh. See, now it's our turn to enjoy the beach. Hey, you guys, you're just in time. 'Hi! Ha ha ha!' Ah, man against the sea. I love it! Yeah! Excuse me. Persons against the sea. Yeah, I thought sailing would put man in harmony with nature. Hey, it's a delicate balance, Jon. Oh, just how much sailing have you done anyway, Ponch? I don't wanna brag, but around the marina they call me "Captain Courageous." Yeah. More like Horatio Hornblower, if you ask me. - Oh, coming up! - Hang on! Whoa! Ha ha ha! 'Hey, Jon!' Whoa! Whoa! Ponch, hang on! Watch out! - Whoa! - Whoa! Well, I'm famished. Where are you going to take us, Jon? Uh, I was just gonna ask you that. Oh, listen, there's a great oyster bar up on the point. Oh, yeah. Chowder, clams on the half shell. Clams on the half shell. You just read my mind. Aww, no. Aww. Not a mark. It's our boys. Yeah. We just became one of their statistics. Hang in there, partner. I'm not gonna let it ruin the afternoon. I'll go down to the restaurant and make the call from there, alright? Jump in. Alright. Mmm! Hey, I lost my CB. You didn't happen to see anything hinky around here, did you? Oh, gee, Jon, I'm sorry. I've been back and forth all morning. Nothing. Okay. Just keep your eyes open, alright? - Sure thing. - I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Well, well, well. Lightning does strike twice. Thanks to insurance. Thanks a lot, guys. Every little bit helps. Don't worry, Jon. Sooner or later, huh? Yeah. You keep saying that. Well, let's take it from the top. We eliminated the ice cream vendors and the pizza trucks. And you forgot about the smoked-fish truck. Oh, yeah. What do you think was in that sauce, huh? I don't wanna talk about it, alright? Alright. It's just like those vals, man. When you want them, you can't find them. Oh, come on, man. Maybe the cops were right. Maybe it isn't them. It had to be them. Just when I was beginning to think they were human. Ah, be fair, man. You don't know. Hey, there they are, man. Let's find out. Hey, you know, that body surfing that's really great, man. I think it's time to get some boards. Yeah. I'm up for that. Maybe Jerry and those guys will, uh.. ...help us pick out the right sticks, huh. Sticks? Hey, you're gaining on them, man. Don't let them get away. They ain't getting away, man. The vals are gonna learn. Hey! We've been looking for you guys. Yeah. I'll bet! Yeah, we wanted to talk to you about getting some boards! Oh, got some money to spend, huh? Hey, man, what's the matter with you guys? Hey, man, you guys have been ripping us off twice, man! Hey, I don't know what you're talking about! Pull over! We're going to see for ourselves! Hey, the hell you are, man! You've got us all wrong! Hey, take a good look at the ocean, Simon. It will be your last! Hey, now, hold on! Nothing's gonna be settled down here! Come on, Mike! Let's just go to the cops! I'm doing it my way now, alright? We're going to settle this once and for all. They're gaining on us! I can see that! Hey! Man, those guys are crazy! Let's just get out of here, Michael! Hey, come on. Watch it, or we'll push them over the edge! They're gonna shove us off the cliff! Hey, go faster, Michael! Just let me do the driving, alright? 'All units in the vicinity of North and PCH' 'we have a citizen's report of an ambulance' 'and a brown van drag racing on Decker Canyon road.' 'Units responding, identify.' Mary 3 and 4 responding. They're gonna kill us! 'Come on, Jerry. Catch them. Let's go!' 'I'm trying to get around the back.' The car! Aah! 'Oh! Ow!' Ah! Unh! Lupe. Come on, Lupe. Get up. Come on. Get up. Aah! Aah! My arm! My arm! - Oh! Oh! LA 15, 7 Mary 4, we have an 11-80 on Decker Canyon two miles North of PCH. Requesting multiple ambulances and a fire unit. Anybody hurt bad? I'm okay, but I think they got some broken bones. My leg! I don't think I can move it. Okay. Don't try. Just lie still, alright? - I'm okay. Yeah, yeah. I think I'm okay. Man, the car, it must have rolled three or four times. I guess we're lucky, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Real lucky. How we doing? I think they learned their lesson just a little bit too late. What do you mean? Yeah, where are we gonna go? Uh, to the hospital. Oh. And then to jail. We got citizens' complaints that'll guarantee you guys at least 48 hours to get acquainted. Sure is quiet out here. Hey, we deserve it. Never get ahead, do they? Since when do they collect trash in a motor home? When it isn't trash. Not a bad day's work. Maybe not. We got a cop. Come outta the truck.. with your hands on your head. Slow! Come on! Step out here, please. Turn around and put your hands on your head. Come on. - There. What? Aw, come on. Tell us one, man. Okay, okay. There was this guy-- Hey, blondie. What? Wait until I get my arms back. What for? Because after you teach us how to surf.. ...we're gonna take you guys down to Baja. The waves are nothing but primo, man. Alright, man. That sounds like a plan. Switch with you? Hey, look who's here. Hey, glad to see everyone's giving it a chance. Hey, we breaking any laws here? No. Then what's the hassle for? Congratulations, partner. Hey, uh, if you guys don't mind we're just trying to enjoy the beach here. Ooh. Well, you heard the man. Which way do you wanna run? That way or this way? This way. Check them out. 'Hey, girls! Hi!' Come on. You're driving with me today. Alright. Let's give it a shot. Gotta be safe, though. Ha ha! 'Okay, Ponch. Let's do it.' 'You got your jacket on, Jon? Right.' Whoo! 'Okay. Just push it out.' Whoa! Whoa!
