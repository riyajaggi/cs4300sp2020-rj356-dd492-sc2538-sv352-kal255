 In nature, everything is connected. As scientists, we explore and expand upon those connections... ...to the benefit of society. We're experimenting with genetically altered electric rays and eels. Think what it would mean if we could harness this bioelectricity... ...generate an alternate form of energy: a new, clean source of power. It sounds great, but you might wanna clean the tank. It's clean. The fluid-- I call it sludge. --Increases the eels' bioelectric signatures. Yes. In fact, those very signatures have become so intense... ...we've been forced to upgrade the lab's bioelectrical filters.

 - We've been forced? - I stand corrected. - We're forcing Max, here, to upgrade. - All I'm saying. - Curt, I need to get Billy to bed. - Sorry, honey. I lost track of time. You? No. I'm shocked. I have to wait for Max to finish, but you go ahead, take Billy home. You might send Peter and Gwen home. - It is a school night, doc. - Right, right, right. Go on, you two. It's my Aunt May early-warning system. I have to call if I'm not home by 10. Hey, Aunt May. Sorry for running late. We just left the lab. I'm gonna make sure Gwen gets home safe, and then I'm on my way. Come on. How's his pul--? - Put these on. - I don't understand.

 There was an accident. We need to quarantine him... ...get his vitals stabilized. He's getting worse by the minute. All right. Take him to the Isolation Ward, stat. I could be in real trouble here. I'm not even sure my spider-powers can save me this time. You know, just once, I'd like to be early for school. "Spider-Man in action." - It's not what you think. - It is too, dufus. Says so right here. The Daily Bugle is offering major fundage... ...for a photo of Spider-Man in action. Then it is what you think. Hey, wait. That was my idea. - Looking foolish in biology class? - No. The spider-picture thing. - I told that bigmouthed Bugle guy to-- - Take photos of someone famous? Yeah, that is revolutionary. All right, class, settle down. I know you're all eager to get yesterday's test back. C-minus? Sweet. The Flash completes another pass. Nice job, Mr. Parker. Another A-plus. Mr. Thompson. Dr. Bromwell, how's Max? Alive. And that's a miracle, believe me. - His condition is stabilized, but-- - Maybe he should just see for himself. Hey, Eddie. Max's body is currently generating a constant stream of bioelectricity. That insulation suit will contain it, protect him and everyone. But, Max, I promise you, it's only temporary. We'll begin work on a cure immediately. Least you can do. Try to rest. Ms. Allan, a moment, please. Liz, if you're gonna raise that grade, you need a tutor. And I'm recommending Peter for the job. Nerd is so not the hot accessory this year. Quality time with Puny Parker? I'd rather fail. Study with Petey? I don't think so. Couldn't Flash tutor me instead? I'm not sure you understand. We want your grade to go up. I can't even watch the game. Yeah, but you can still yell at the TV. So really, hey, what's changed, right? That supposed to be funny? You know I had plans before this happened. Go back to college, meet someone, have a life. Dude, chill. You have to give yourself time to adjust. Adjust to what, this? I'm out of here. Max, wait. See, the chapter's really about how biological systems interact. Anything in there about how biological systems are boring? Yeah, dullsville, right? Hey, who wants to waste their time with a textbook? What a coincidence. Flash just texted me those exact words... ...about you, Petey. Maybe if you stopped texting Flash for just a minute-- Good idea. I'll call him instead. Daddy, what's he wearing? And what are you staring at? - I was just waiting for your order. - Coffee. Oh, man. I can't even drink a lousy cup of coffee. Sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, yeah, I'll be fluent in geek. Thug alert. And just when I was having so much fun being ignored. This tutoring thing is something you need, not me. So when you're ready to learn, let me know. Liz? Can you hear me? Liz? Someone's getting paid for Spidey's picture. Might as well be me. Okay, self-portraits aren't going to be as easy as I thought. What I need is a group shot. - Move, move. - Look out. Just leave me alone. Hey, SPF- Say, "Spider-Man." Wonderful. You are a very cooperative crook. But I can't get a good mug shot if you're wearing this. You shouldn't have done that. You really shouldn't have done that. Why did you attack me? Now, now. "Attack" is such a strong word. What's your game? All right, Electro. Time to unplug. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! You should have left me alone. Perfect. - Hello? - Hey, Aunt May. - Peter, it's almost 10. - Yeah, I know. That's why I'm calling. I've been tutoring. It's slow going, but I'll be home soon. I hope so. The weatherman predicted rain. You don't have your umbrella. Yeah, somehow, I doubt an umbrella would help. I mean, it's not raining here yet. Okay, bye, Aunt May. Don't wait up. All right, Electro, I'm-- --all alone. Blurry. Blurry. Oh, nice one of my elbow. Or my knee, maybe. And this one would've been great if my arm was 2 feet longer. No way the Bugle will take any of these. Not only does Lightning-Butt get away... -...but I've got nothing to show-- - Peter. I just talked to Eddie. There was an accident at the lab. Max's life is trashed. And not only don't I recognize him, I attack him. Not sure if I could've helped, but at least I could've tried. - Petey. - Yeah, Petey. Look, I feel bad for ditching you last night. So if you still want help, we can meet after school at the ESU lab. It's up to you. Could we put him in a tank? - Use a bioelectric filter to siphon--? - No. Won't work, I'm afraid. Eels evolved to exist in aquatic environments. Max didn't. With the voltage he's currently generating... ...you don't want him anywhere near water. Petey? Petey? Max, we need to get you back to the hospital. Done with hospitals. Just wanna go home. - I'm not sure you're ready for-- - Listen, Dillon. After last night's blowout, it's either a hospital room or a jail cell. - Your call. - My call? My call? None of this has been my call! - Max, stop. We just wanna help you. - You can't help me. But I know who can. - Maybe this isn't such a good time. - No, go on. I need to check some results in my office anyway. So, Eddie, you quarterbacking for ESU? No. Hung up my jersey back at Midtown. - I'm strictly a nerd now. - We're all nerds here. - You can be too. - Wonderful. I'm serious, Liz. You're smart. You can get this stuff. You just need to look at it in a new way. - Petey. - In nature, everything's connected. As scientists, we explore and expand upon those connections. As people, we should do the same. Thought you said this stuff was boring. You're lucky to have Pete as a tutor, Liz. Guy knows his stuff. Probably a Nobel Prize in his future. I have the results of-- Curt, what are you doing? It's nothing. I can explain. - What is that? - An experimental bio-formula. - Genetically altered lizard DNA. - What? Connors! Where's Connors? You really don't wanna keep me waiting, kids. - Where's Connors? - Max, I'm right here. Try to stay calm. Calm? We left calm behind a lifetime ago, doc. I can't take it anymore. You caused this, you cure it. We're working on that, Max, I promise. It'll just take time. I don't have time. Cure me now... ...before I really get upset. I know you can do it, doc. All you need is the proper motivation. Oh, well. The secret-identity thing was fun while it lasted. - I'll distract him. You get the girls out. - What? Eddie, no. Come on. In there. It'll be safe. - Police Emergency? There's a-- - Gwen. Gwen, wait. Where's Petey? Max, please, don't hurt him. We'll find a cure. We just need time. You're lying. Guys, I know it's not exactly a cure, but how about some chill pills? You! Yeah, me. Look, I messed up before. - But now I really wanna help. - You wanna hold my hand? None of you get it. Without a cure, I'm not Max Dillon. I'm-- What'd you call me? - Lighting-Butt? - No, not that. Electro. Yeah. I'm Electro. All right, Electro, you wanna vent, then vent. Gone. My only chance at a cure, and you let them escape. That's it. The gloves are off. That Bugle prize money's as good as mine. If Spider-Man would just stand still. Sorry, photo shoot's over. But if those shots come out, I want my cut. Okay, Electro, the gloves are on. See? You can dish it out, but you can't-- Oh, me and my big spider-mouth. Can't escape me up there, web-slinger. This is my playground. Okay, maybe climbing a big metal tower wasn't the brightest idea. Oh, man, where does the time go? - Hello? - Hi, Aunt May. Peter, where are you? You sound strange, and there's so much static. Yeah, it's a bad connection. I'm running late again, but-- Peter, you're taking advantage of our arrangement. Calling in late every night is not acceptable. Sorry, I can't hear you. Static. I'll be home soon. Bye. I am so grounded. Of course, being grounded right now might not be such a bad thing. What I really need is a plan. Or the world's biggest dunk-tank. Petey, what were you thinking last night? - That I should try to help? - And did you? Me? No. - Old Petey's pretty useless, I guess. - I wouldn't say that. Hey, what's Puny Parker doing here? Leaving, I hope. Peter Parker: another hapless victim of the wild, undomesticated cheerleader. It's her loss, Pete. And, hey, if the job was to help her learn... ...at least you taught her how to fold to peer pressure. No big. I reached out, and she knocked my hand away. You can't control everything. Trick is to never stop trying. We won't stop trying, Curt, but we can't do anything more today. Come on. Let's go home.
