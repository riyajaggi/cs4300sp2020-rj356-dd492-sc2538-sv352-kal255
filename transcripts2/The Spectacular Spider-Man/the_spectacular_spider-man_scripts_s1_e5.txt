 First time I've ever blown my way out of a store. Yeah, Marko. Biggest score we ever made. I'm loving it. I'm loving there's no Spider-Man down here to cramp our style. Didn't know you had any style. Hi, boys. Two bags full of cash, and we lost them. I can't believe it. I can't believe we lost to that pathetic little web-creep again. Bail's been paid. Guess pond scum can have friends. Who knew? Get in, boys.

 Oh, and welcome to the big time. You talking to me? Then say hello to my webs. Peter? Just a sec, Aunt May, I-- I gotta straighten up a bit. My goodness, you did straighten up. I've never seen this room so spare. Where's the clutter? Shoved under the bed as usual? Hey, I'm not 5 anymore. I don't need to resort to tricks. Well, I'm impressed, Peter. And not just with the room. You have been very good about getting home by your new curfew. And as a reward, I've decided to restore the old rules. You can stay out until 10 and call if you're gonna be late. - What's that? - What, this? This is just a flyer for the Midtown High Fall Formal.

 But I'm not going. I don't have a date. Oh, Peter, you lead such a sheltered life. Why not ask Anna Watson's niece, Mary Jane? Miss Wonderful Personality? Yeah, let me think on that. Right now, I gotta get to school. - What about O'Hirn? - This is a solo job. And the Big Man's had his eye on you, Marko. The Big Man? Do I get to meet him? No one meets the Big Man. Okay, I'm here with my two best friends and neither's talking to me. - Should I change seats? - Oh, don't be a doof. So you couldn't help me with my calc test. I'm over it. Morning. Coach Smith here with a quick announcement. After the injury of our starting tight end... ...and the academic suspension of our backup... ...the Midtown Mustangs will be holding three days of tryouts... ...starting this afternoon. Perfect. I am so there. Harry, you know I'm all about being the encouraging gal pal... ...but the words, "catastrophic bone breakage" do come to mind here. Yeah, Harr, you seen the size of those guys? Come on, if you're worried, how about a little moral support? Try outwith me. I'll pass. No pun intended. - Hey, Kong. Osborn's trying out. - Cool. - Cool? - Hey, I need another tackling dummy. Broke my last one. Hey, Harr, on second thought, tryouts, I got your back. So, doc, what's with the arms? These? Well, they allow me to multitask, manipulate difficult objects... ...and, of course, maintain a safe distance. You need a safe distance? What about me? Actually, there are concerns. Marko, relax. Procedure's simple, painless and totally worth it. Show him. Yes, well, the subject is infused... ...with millions of microscopic silicon granules... ...creating subdermal silicon armor. Now, in theory, he'll be able to pass through metal detectors... ...well, undetected, and he'll be impervious. "Impervious"? What? Is that a good thing? Yeah. Means nothing and no one can hurt you... ...including Spider-Man. All right, ladies, listen up. I only have room for two of you on the team: one starter, one backup. Don't worry, Brown, you're in. We'll make sure of it. All right, helmets on. Let's play some football. Some real talent out there. Your buddy, Hobie, yeah, he's good. But those two skinny little juniors, they might just be better. They're sure giving King Kong a rough time. - They're not the only ones. - Grow up, Kenny. Why would I date someone too immature to play fair? - But Glory-- - I'm serious. Cut it out or we're history. Please, Mr. Osborn. This lab, it was assembled so rapidly. And the equipment, it's substandard. At the least, I need more time. The experiment's never really been tested. This is the test. Press the button, doctor. Oh, God. Stop. Stop it now. Stop! The magnetic field directing the silicon is overloading. - We must abort. - Not yet. What have we done? What do we do? We sweep up and we try again. Wait. What's going on in there? No! What have you done to me? I know you're in there! Answer me! Hey, Mr. Sandman. Chill. There you go. You got your sand legs, your sand clothes. Hey, and now you're in color. - See, it's not so bad. - Not so bad? Stuff happens. End result's the same. You got power no one else got. Not even Spider-Man. Now, you can get revenge... ...for all those times the web-head put you behind bars. Yeah. No, wait. Revenge is for chumps. I don't care about Spider-Man. All I ever wanted was the big score. - And now I got the power to get it. - Now, listen, you little nobody-- Hey, Flint Marko was a nobody. But everyone will know the name Sandman. You're taking this calmly. I thought Big Man wanted a super-villain to fight Spider-Man. Big Man wanted the bug distracted. Think that boy won't make a good distraction... ...you haven't been paying attention. Yeah, I could get used to this. I mean, sure, I went a little arachnobatic on Kong. But it's not like I cheated. No one yells at Flash when he uses his natural talents. Oh, man, Marko, this is so getting old. Where's your partner? Don't think I need a partner anymore. - What just--? - Happened? - I happened. Sandman happened. - No, that's just wrong. No, no, no. Not a good time to run out of web-- Let me guess, you were on a reality show. Changing Faces or Completely Ridiculous Makeovers? Nice, huh? The Big Man did this to me to get to you. - The Big Man? Who's the Big Man? - That-- That's need to know only. Look, cleaning your clock's been fun, but I got banks to rob. Oh, man, my money. Forget football. Soon as school's out, I'm webbing up Sandman once-- Hey, Petey. Nice moves yesterday. Heard it's down to you, Harry and Hobie Brown. Good luck. Course, Sandman will still be around after tryouts, right? That was a good day. I haven't made a final decision... ...but I'm leaning toward Parker as our starter, with Osborn as second string. Anyone wants to change my mind has one more day of tryouts to do it. Unbelievable. The geeks are inheriting the Earth. - You didn't even want to try out. - Yeah. Who knew? This was my dream, Pete. You're already the smartest kid in school. - You really need this too? - Harry, I-- Guys, we're headed to the Silver Spoon. Wanna come? Sure. My treat. Hey, if you insist. Rain check. Say, aren't you football star Peter Parker? How come you aren't hanging with your new friends? Because I like my old friends? I know you think I've been acting like a jerk. I put taking photos for the Bugle before more important things. But I promise it won't happen again. So can you forgive me already? You're forgiven. It would take too long to train anyone else. So, Peter, the dance is only a few days away and-- - I asked Miss Brant from the Bugle. - Wow, that's great. You don't actually call her "Miss Brant" in person, do you? Never mind. I'm sure you two will have the best-- - She turned me down. - Well, she is totally missing out. - Besides, she's not the only girl who-- - Doesn't matter. There's no way I'm going near that stupid formal. Right. Stupid formal. I gotta go because the Bugle will want photos. Except I just promised you I wouldn't put the Bugle before our friendship. - It's okay. Just be careful. - Thanks, Gwen. You totally rock. Glad you noticed. Surprise. Gee, web-head, if I'm over here, who's driving? Go! Good thing I refilled the web-shooters. All webbed up and nowhere to go. Who do you think I am? Flint Marko? Spider tricks don't work on the Sandman. But do sand tricks work on the Spider-Man? Oh, this can't be good. And then what happened? Okay, so then he gets in a second accident at the tollbooth. Worst chauffer we ever had. I thought my dad was gonna, like, pop a vessel. Maybe the chauffer wasn't the problem. Wow, who knew being super-rich was so tough? Yeah. Well, I-- I mean, no. I mean-- It's okay. I'm just teasing you. Better get used to it. Way you played today, you and Parker both... ...you'll be spending more time with this crowd. Yeah, but not tonight. Come on, Glory, let's hit it. Sorry. Kenny. What are you, 6? Look, I wanted to be your girlfriend, not your babysitter. Oh, Glory, it was a joke. You're not gonna break up with me again? What do you think? Come on, Harry. Take me home. This ain't a problem we can fix. Cordon off the area. And pray Spidey can handle the freak. You know, I hadn't planned on coming after you. But you're determined to be the cloud hanging over my sunny, sandy beach. Time to change the weather forever. All right, Sandman. Show me what you got. Better yet, I'll show you. Wow, you sure showed me. The hammer thing's getting old, pal. I could keep this up all night. Can you, web-head? I guess if I'm gonna win, I'll have to take a dive, literally. It's over, Spider-Man. When you were the only one with powers, you had me beat. But now King Sandman reigns supreme. Your Majesty. Allow me to build a statue in your honor. Michelangelo, eat your heart out. Hey, Mom. Dad. Harry. What happened to you? And what's with the helmet? Going to a costume party? I'm trying out for the team. Football? Not really your strong suit, is it? Guess we'll find out tomorrow. Here's what we got: Osborn, you're first string. Brown, second. Parker, maybe next year. Yeah, if we're desperate. I guess yesterday was just beginner's luck. Hey, if I wanted all the glory, I wouldn't wear a mask. So Harry gets his dream, and I watch from the sidelines. Ice cream? Of course, that has its benefits too.
