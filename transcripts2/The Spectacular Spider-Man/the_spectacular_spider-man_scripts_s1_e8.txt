 Paging Green Goblin. Paging Mr. Green Goblin. I hate it when the bad guy gets away. Help. Police. They've stolen the cars. We did it. - Peekaboo. - Spider-Man! Don't freak. I'll shake him. This is how we're playing it? Oh, I am so out of here. Since we're stuck here, you might as well slow this baby down. She won't stop. I swear.

 The hobbit took out the brakes. We're gonna crash! You can thank me later, dude. I'll shake him. I'll shake him! Isn't this where I came in? Or maybe this is where I go out. And that's a wrap. Okay, not quite as easy as it looked. Say, hey, what do you say? Midtown wins the Mustang way Go, Mustangs! Score! Break. - It's a nail-biter, folks. The Mustangs are down by 5 with the ball... ...on their own 40 and six seconds to go.

 Hey, tiger, you just getting here? Yeah, but-- What are you doing here? - Flash invited me. - Flash? Thompson takes the snap, rolls back... ...and tosses a Hail Mary. Touchdown! Harry Osborn makes an unbelievable catch... -...to win the game! - Yay, Harry! So, M.J., I thought at the dance that you and me-- - That we-- - Slow down, tiger. It's not like we're going steady, or something equally primitive. We're friends, okay? - Well, sure, but-- - I'm gonna congratulate Flash. - Hi, Petey. - Oh, hey, Liz. Did you hear? Everyone's going to Coney Island tomorrow. You know, to celebrate the win. Think maybe you'll come? Wouldn't miss it. Osborn. Burger run. You in? I'll catch up. Rand? ls Harry still inside? Should be right out. Hey, look. Osborn's got a groupie. Excuse me, but my friend's still in there. Don't think so. Sorry. But what about the Spider-Man? He's battled Sandman and the Rhino. He could trace them back to OsCorp. To me. Enough. You whine more than my son. I can't have weak men in my organization, Otto. Don't make me get rid of-- Octavius? Are you in there? Yes, I'm sorry. - I'll do what I'm told. - That's all I ask. Now, run your experiments like a good Dr. Octopus. Mr. Osborn, please, I've told you. That name is so... ...demeaning. Safety key has been removed. Experiment will not commence until key is reinserted. Safety key reinserted. Experiment may now commence. Warning: safety key engaged. Safety protocols initiated. Experiment will commence in 30 seconds. Warning: electro-magnetic emitters are set to exceed risk parameters. Who's in there? Who turned that key? Please, you have to stop. I'm inside! Experiment will commence in five seconds. - Four. Three. Two. - No. No, this is not right. - No, not right! - One. Zero. I've been good. That's OsCorp. Harry's dad could be in trouble. But even at web-slinging speed, it could take me a while to get there. Been wanting to try this. - What the devil's going on? - It's Dr. O, sir. He's down. - But the doors are sealed shut-- - Out of my way. Security override NO-1 engaged. Octavius? Doctor? Where are you--? Otto. I got it. Is he...? He has a pulse, sir. But it looks as if-- As if his harness has fused to his skin. Otto? Otto, are you there? I can't have weak men in my organization, Otto. Can't have weak men. Weak men. I will not be weak. Otto, get up-- Silence, you imperious moron! Whoa, whoa, there, Slinky. Mr. Osborn here helped save your life. You! For the record, I helped save your life too. Do not insult my intelligence, hero. You tracked me down and tried to destroy me. As I knew you would. Destroy you? Pal, I don't even know you. Oh, but I survived. And more to the point, I have improved. I am now one with my arms. Oh, you failed, Spider-Man. And your failure has given me new life. - Otto. - Not Otto. Otto Octavius was weak. Call me Dr. Octopus. Look, doc, you thought this through? The next Spider-Man who finds you might view this as a cautionary tale. Glib does not equate with clever, Spider-Man. Yeah, well, the ratio of arms to sanity hasn't exactly been established either. Do you ever shut up? Sorry, no. My fans expect a certain amount of quippage in every battle. Mr. Osborn, shouldn't we be helping Spider-Man? Knock yourself out. Come on, doc. You're a cephalopod, I'm an arthropod. Can't we just hug it out? You're slowing down, arachnid. But my arms never tire. And soon they'll crush-- An alarm clock too? Man, those arms come with all the perks. My apologies, Spider-Man... ...but I have places to go, and worlds to conquer. So your obituary will have to be written another day. Paging Dr. Octopus. As if Goblin wasn't bad enough. Harry! Harry, are you okay? - Gwen? - Harry, what happened? "Happened"? Game wiped me out, that's all. So you took a catnap on the cement? Gwen. Look, you know I don't need a fancy feather bed to-- Harry, get serious. Please, I'm too beat for serious tonight. A bunch of us are going to Coney Island tomorrow. Come along. It's been a while. - And then we'll have a real talk? - Oh, totally. Okay, well, see you. Ned, you're already working the Spider-Man story. At least you're supposed to be. No, I am, I am. But, chief, I think this Goblin thing's the same story. I feel it in my gut. You think? You feel? That's reason enough to give Goblin to Foswell. Foswell. Lee. Am I paying you to hide in here? Never mind. What do you think of my son, Colonel John Jameson? He's a modern-day American hero. That's what I like about you, Foswell. You're an objective journalist. Hop on a plane, coach, and get down to the Cape... ...to cover my son's shuttle launch. Now, go. Come on. Go! Fine. Green Goblin and Spidey. I cannot believe I once lived in this anemic hovel. Well, no more. And no more, "Yes, Mr. Osborn. I'm sorry, Mr. Osborn. Please, Mr. Osborn." How I groveled before that man. But soon the whole world shall grovel... ...before the genius that is Dr. Octopus. But first I require a source of power... ...that will not abandon me mid-battle. This will do for the short term. Oh, but I need a more permanent solution... ...to guarantee the Spider-Man's destruction. - Yes! - Where do you hide the muscle? - Harry? - Gwen. Glad you could make it. - So, guys, corn dogs? My treat. - Harry, wait. - Hey, Gwen. - Oh, Peter, I'm glad you're here. Something's really weird with Harry. And this surprises you? Okay, okay, not the look. I mean, sure, the football thing's gone to his head. But look at him. He's a walking commercial for happy. - It isn't that-- - Hi, Gwen. Mind if I borrow Petey? Don't worry, Gwen. Harry's fine. I guess I got sticky fingers. Is it me, or is this awkward? What's that? Look, sorry. All that sugar. My stomach. I gotta go. Don't follow. Typical Puny Parker. Leaves me holding the bag. No offense, girls. The old stomping grounds. Otto? Is that you? Dr. Twaki. How nice to see you again. Now, perhaps you'll recall that when I was last employed here... ...I was at work on a prototype long-term power source. The- The Megan-Pack. But-- My work, and yet, when I departed... ...you took possession of it. Now, in hindsight, does that seem quite fair? It's in R & D. Vault 8. My lucky number. Like an old friend. Gangway. Coming through. Spider-Man. Hey, doc. Love the new look. Hand over the device. I'm thinking, no. Then you invite your doom. You're in an enclosed space, web-slinger. Where can you hide? You will suffer for this indignity, Spider-Man. Hi. In a hurry, being chased by multi-armed guy. Wants this. What is it? The Megan-Pack. A power source. Holds a sizable charge for years at a time. Thanks. You should hide now. Spider-Man! Old daddy longlegs needs power. Which explains his alarm back at OsCorp and why he took off so fast. So all I have to do is play keep-away until his tank's on empty. No sweat. Okay. Maybe a little sweat. Quiet! We're finally getting started. After hours of delay... ...we have lift-off. Go, Johnny! That's my boy. Stop that, Miss Brant. I'm a married man. - Look out. - Man. Watch out. And now back to our regularly-scheduled chaos. A guy could get used to this. Thanks for the company. Love to stay, but I've got a doctor's appointment. Doc, your bedside manner stinks. Hand over the device, you pathetic four-limbed excuse for a spider. Oh, you sweet-talker you. - Don't worry, Spidey, I got your back. - No! Appreciate the help, fanboy. Keep clear. You're not pretty enough to save twice. Right. Right. Smack him one for me. I should have seen it sooner, Spider-Man. You're weak. - You can't bear to see anyone hurt. - I could learn to make an exception. And your meager thought process is so transparent: Stall until his power runs out. But this pack has another hour of juice at least. And think of all the damage I can do in one hour. Starting with the girl. Choose: The device or the girl. You want it? Then fetch. Oh, help! Help! Somebody! Subway to Coney Island: 2 bucks. Riding turbulence: 6. Saving Liz Allan: priceless. - Finally, it's mine. - You won't get the chance to use it. Not as long as I'm conscious. A situation easily remedied. As I was saying... - What's going on? - What's going on? Are you kidding me? They're breaking up. Flash Thompson and Liz Allan... ...Midtown's number one power couple... ...are calling it quits. And it's all your fault. Dude. Kudos on the ruthlessness. What? No. I didn't mean to-- Not now, tiger. Trust me. Pete. I know it's not the best time, with the soap opera... ...and the supervillain and everything... ...but we really need to talk to Harry. I'm worried about him. Yeah, yeah, okay. Where is Harry? I'm talking about the Green Goblin. The wacko's attacking the Big Man's operations. And as far as we can tell... ...he's using a lot of OsCorp tech. My tech has been stolen. I've lost my top scientist. My lab's destroyed, and my projects are at risk. Why would I be behind all that? Yeah, yeah, okay. - But the Goblin-- -ls a common enemy. And our common goal must be to unmask him... ...before it's too late.
