 'Twas the night before Halloween And all through Manhattan Not a criminal was stirring Not even Green Goblin Might as well enjoy the peace and quiet while I can. "Manhattan." "Goblin." They sort of rhyme. So, Colonel Jameson, any early trick-or-treaters up there? Hope not. We're fresh out of candy. But seriously, I still remember my first Halloween. I was an astronaut. Big surprise, right? As much as I love the beauty... ...and tranquility of space, I'm glad we're landing tomorrow... ...to see the costumes of the next generation of dreamers.

 Plus, this year, my astronaut costume rocks. Life-support's still up. Otherwise-- Otherwise, it's, "Houston, we have a problem." Heat shields are fairly trashed. Anyone know a good body shop up here? Although Colonel John Jameson maintains his sense of humor... ...the real question remains: Will the shuttle be able to land safely? The damaged shield, coupled with loss of the navigational computer... ...greatly increases the hazard. We heard from Foswell? Already in California, awaiting the shuttle's landing. Assuming it does land. We'll just get out of your way, Mr. Jameson. Shout out if you need anything.

 Keep laughing, Kermit. I hear green's the new black-and-blue. You should be green with envy, because you lack my fashion sense. Oh, and built-in gas mask. Goblin. I know you're out there. Out there. In here. Everywhere. Yes, this will soon be my town, Hammie. And I could use a good right-hand flattop. Not gonna happen. You think I'm afraid of a goofball dressed for Halloween? Can't be afraid of what you don't respect. And I've only ever respected one man enough to fear. The Big Man, alias L. Thompson Lincoln. See, I've already peeked under his mask. Lincoln is the mask. The Big Man's Tombstone. Because that's all that's left when you cross him. Well, if that's true... ...then a man like you must surely have acquired life insurance. The astronauts have done all they can to repair the damage. Now Colonel Jameson has only one chance to bring his crew home. He must manually pilot the craft to reenter the Earth's atmosphere... ...at precisely the right angle, or they'll burn up on reentry. - What's that, Harry? - Nothing. New soda. - Then you won't mind giving me a sip. - No. This is why you were passed out the other night. Harry, whatever that stuff is, you need help. This is the help. 4.0 GPA, football stud, in-crowd, all thanks to the Green. Harry, no. A few blackouts are a small price to pay. So spare me your concern. My life's great. Dial Hammerhead. Oh, I'm sorry, Hammerhead can't come to the phone right now. He's a bit tied up. You gotta love the classics. Hammerhead can take care of himself. And you as well, apparently. He had a portable jump drive with enough incriminating evidence... ...to put dear Mr. Lincoln behind bars forever. Not to worry. The drive's in little old (Bobby's possession now. I don't have it on me. But I will have it tonight. - When tonight? Where? - Believe me, you'll know. I know a trap when I-- But that's what makes it fun. Besides, what choice do you have? Oh, and come alone. How does she do it? One look, and next thing you know... ...I'm swinging across town to have a talk with Harry. Oh, look who's finally showing his ugly rubber face. - Landed me a big one. - Who's landed whom? - Where you been, Greeny? Vacation? - Been looking for you. We both want Tombstone out of the picture. - For totally different reasons. - Details, details. And speaking of details... ...I've got a jump drive that can take Tombstone down for good. Great. Fork it over. I'll take you both in. I don't have it on me. But I'll have it tonight. - When tonight? Where? - Anyone else getting déja vu? Oh, well. Let's run with it. Believe me, you'll know. If Gwen's right, losing Gobby will seem way less painful... ...than talking to Harry. Not even sure if Gobby came in here. But he wouldn't be the first wackadoo to target Harry's dad. Been coming here for years, and I've never seen that door before. No. I mean, so the guy likes masks. But that doesn't mean that he-- Yeah, besides, Gobby keeps stealing OsCorp tech. So unless those thefts were staged to throw off suspicion... Hey, Dad, I'm home. Oh, great. Now Harry's got two problems. How can I talk to him about either with Green Gosborn... -...in the next room? - Dad? I'm not kidding, Harry. We need to talk. - Then come on up. - Not a good idea. Just come down. Oh, so you can give me an earful for Gwen? No, thanks. Besides, I need to get in costume. I'll meet you in an hour at the Bleecker Street Carnival. Thanks for supporting Midtown High, and happy Halloween. I mean...matey. Enjoy the cookie. It's Gwen, right? Hi. Hi, Mary Jane. I need to find Pete. Have you seen him? - I was going to ask you. - He went to talk to Harry-- Lean to the left, lean to the right Stand up, sit down, fight, fight, fight Go, Mustangs! - Shake those pom-poms! - Yeah, shake tho-- Wait. Are they mocking us? Trick or treat, smell my feet Give me something good to eat Oh, come on. You're not gonna break up with me over a cookie. Are you? - So you as dangerous as you look? - Wouldn't you like to know. You haven't complimented my costume. - Trying to get the latest on the shuttle. - Which matters to me, why? Maybe because John Jameson's like an older brother to me. And because he may not make it. I'm told that as the shuttle enters Earth's atmosphere... ...NASA Will likely lose contact. Whatever happens, Foswell, you give it to me straight. Sure, J.J., straight. Fasten your seat belts. It's gonna be a bumpy night. Nothing yet, boss. Nothing. Nothing. J.J., I'm sorry. Wait. There it is. It's landing. - They're safe! - Yeah! All right! - Yeah! - All right! He did it. My boy did it. Hey, hey. I'm not paying you bums to watch television. Get me a new layout in 17 seconds, or you're all fired. Go, go, go! Congratulations, boss. It's great news. It's the news. What are these? A couple of freaks in costumes. Worthless. The Bugle's celebrating a real hero, my son, John. - But what do I do with--? - Sell them to the Globe, for all I care. That rag will print anything. Mr. Osborn. Didn't expect to see you back tonight. - Through the front door no less. - You wanna rule the world... ...you don't punch time clocks. - Mr. Osborn. He took it, stole it. - A thief? Here? What did he steal? - The Inhibitor prototype. - Freeze, dirtbag. - Gwen'? - Oh, Peter, finally. I've been calling and-- What's up with Harry? He's meeting me at the carnival. I'm already here. Where are you? - Pete? - Nice costume, huh? I'm gonna cream Osborn. The little wimp was supposed to be the top of our pyramid. Hey, look. It's the Spectacular Spider-Geek. Gotta say, tiger, you fill out that costume nicely. Very nicely. You can web me up anytime, Petey. Puny Parker? He looks nothing like Spidey. - I should've been Spider-Man. - Don't worry, Flash. You fill out your costume nicely too. - Goblin. - Pete, we really should find Harry. Pete? So Gobby offered you the secret-toy surprise too. - Trap'? Wrap Yeah, figured. Race you inside. Always with the drama. - This is so embarrassing. - And disappointing. Did you really think you needed a jump drive to protect you? Did you think a jump drive could protect you? Come on, boss, you can't have fallen for that. There's no drive, no incriminating evidence. - There never was. - Yes, yes, I'm a big fat liar. Like we didn't all know this was a trap. Welcome to the Green Goblin's House of Horror. Or should I say Refinery of Revulsion? - Thanks? - Take down the Goblin... ...or at least unmask him, and we'll call it even. Excuse me. Who rescued who from the molten steel? Wipeout. Next time you throw a bash, Gobby, leave out snacks. Your guests will stay longer. How embarrassing. But at least I brought party favors. Terrifying, huh? Or is nothing scary after seeing me in a skirt? The skirt's cool. I know you lost a bet, but you made the best of it. Glad you feel that way. I mean, now that me and Liz have split up-- Pom-poms to yourself, big guy. I like you, but I won't be your replacement girl. This redhead's a free agent. Plans to keep it that way. No Harry. No Pete. Someone is so getting the look. Why don't you just give up? Because I know your secret. I know whose face is behind that mask. We all wear masks, Spider-Man. But which one is real? The one that hides your face, or the one that is your face? I know you're Norman Osborn. Am I? Impressive webbing. Now try mine. So, what do you think of my Gob-webs? Now, let's see what cracks first, my Gob-webs or your bones. Well, that taught us nothing. Perhaps a more drastic experiment is required. Happy landing, Spider-Man. This better work. Okay, all this pain at least proves I'm still alive. Oh, right. Kind of used it all up. Go ahead, run. I know where you live. I knew it. - You're the Green Goblin? - No. This isn't my costume. I'm a cheerleader. - Harry? Spider-Man? What is--? - You're not limping. Why would I be limping? Why is Harry wearing...? - Where did this come from? - Dad, I-- - What is it? - Globulin Green. An early-stage, experimental performance enhancer. Highly unstable and addictive. You stole it from OsCorp, didn't you? Why would you do something so dangerous? So stupid? For you. You told me to man up. So I took the Green to become the son you always wanted me to be. To become a man, like you. I must've blacked out again. I-- I don't remember anything. But I can't be the Goblin. Can I? I never should've taken it. I ruined everything. I'm sorry. - I'm so, so sorry. - This makes no sense. If Ha-- If this kid's the Goblin, why would he attack the Big Man? - Why attack OsCorp? - I've had dealings with the Big Man. But when I tried to extricate myself, I was threatened by his stooge. - Hammerhead. - Harry must've overheard. Under the influence of the Green, his subconscious created someone... ...who could take the Big Man down. - Now, as to why he attacked me... - Maybe I've got some anger issues. I will not allow this. I'll say I was the Goblin. After all, I invented the Green. I'm the obvious suspect. No. He needs you. And what good could you do him... ...locked away for a crime you didn't commit? Didn't I? This is all my fault. I drove Harry to... I will get him help, I swear. - If you'll let me. - Me? If you turn him in, if the Big Man learns Harry was the Goblin... ...he wouldn't survive the night. Please. He's my only child. And my best friend. The Goblin disappears forever... ...leaving a mystery that never gets solved. Thank you. And why should I care what the Globe runs on its front page? Because their Spider-Man scoop, and Parker's pictures of it... ...slaughtered our space-shuttle coverage at the newsstands. The people have spoken. Get that traitor Parker in here and lock him into an exclusive deal. If they want Spider-Man, we'll give them Spider-Man. Here's tomorrow's front-page headline: "Spider-Man: threat or menace?" - Hey, tiger. - Oh, hey, M.J. - M.J.? What are you doing here? - I go to school here now. Midtown's Theater Magnet accepted me. I wanted to tell you last night, but you disappeared. - As usual. - Sorry. I went looking for Harry. - But I never found him. - Then you probably haven't heard. Harry's taking a leave of absence from school to travel abroad... ...and get the help he needs. And that makes it a happy ending, right? So, Colonel Jameson, good to be home? Yep. Back on solid ground. Where it's nice and safe.
