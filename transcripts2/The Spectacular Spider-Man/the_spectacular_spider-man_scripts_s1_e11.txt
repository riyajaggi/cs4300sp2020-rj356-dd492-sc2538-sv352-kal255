 The Spectacular Spider-Man (2008–2009): Season 1, Episode 11 - Group Therapy - full transcript 
 Peter was looking forward to a lazy Saturday, but Adrian Toomes manages to free from jail fellow criminal freaks Rhino, Electro, Sandman, Hammerhead and Alex O'Hirn. At least the alien goo proves a very practical costume improvement. Yet it come at a price: amnesia, or the suit operates on its own. Meanwhile Pete is ostracized at school for 'selfishly' photographing Spidey instead of preventing the theft.

 Max, I'm very proud of you. You've made tremendous progress. You need to continue therapy... ...but I just know you'll do great out there. Owe it all to you, Dr. Kafka. Thanks. - I'm out. - Excellent, Maxwell. I'm so pleased. You're the only person who wrote to me at Ravencroft, Dr. Octavius. I've taken a special interest in your case. An interest which should benefit us both. Yeah. Love the idea of double-teaming you-know-who. Double-team? Oh, surely, we can do better than that.

 Busy tonight? Mr. H indicated we're available. Do not approach walls or door or tranquilizing gas will be released... ...to immobilize O'Hirn, comma, Alexander. I know. Do not approach walls or door or air pressure will be activated... ...to contain Marko, comma, Flint. I know. A sandwich? This is a joke, right? Raw silicates only, Toomes. I don't eat food no more. Just save room for dessert: Spider-Man, é la mode. Do not approach walls or door-- Finally, she shuts up.

 Back in business. - Nice night. - Yeah, for a walk. Tickles. And...now. Oh, Maxwell, my dear boy. Doc, I kind of prefer Electro. I understand completely. Now, if you would do the honors... Boys. Okay, Ox, Fancy Dan, with me. Montana, stick with these mooks for now. Last boat off the island's that way. Gotta love these lazy Saturday mornings. Or noons. Better get up. Yikes. This new alien suit is quite the time-saver. I just need my web-shooters. It makes its own webs? How sweet is that? How did I ever live without you? Making this the third time the singer's baby was found driving her car. - Aunt May? - Now, repeating our top story-- Shouldn't you get ready for your night on the town with Mrs. Watson? To be honest, I'm feeling a touch peaked. Perhaps I'll stay in. But you've had these theater tickets for months. Come on, you deserve to have a little fun once in a while. Well, I suppose. Just have the time of your life, okay? All escapees were originally arrested following battles with Spider-Man. Yo, bro. Hey, don't leave me hanging. - If only. - You ticked or something? Are you serious? You take pictures of Spidey stealing the alien instead of calling the cops... ...and you wonder if I'm ticked? - Bro, I-- - Stow the "bros." That's done. I was over the whole Lizard thing. But this is who you are, Pete: a user. You do what gets you ahead... ...even if it hurts the people you claim are your friends. What you need is a taste of your own medicine. Have something you care about taken away. Trouble is, I'm not sure you actually care about anything. Oh, great. Perfect. Wonderful. I've lost my oldest friend. Well, who needs him? I've got the cool, new suit. And a little something to take my mind off my troubles. I hear St. John Devereaux is just hilarious as Falstaff. Freeze, O'Hirn. It's that awful rhinoceros person. Rhino, I knew no prison was wide enough to hold you. Wide enough. Yeah, funny. I knew they taught trades in the slammer, but a sense of humor? I don't get the tingles when the bad guy's in plain sight. Sorry, Spidey. Was I supposed to wait my turn? You two are partners again? Us two? Afraid you ain't getting off that easy, bug. Now, then, arachnid, any last words? --Comes to mind. Ladies, you may want to step aside. So you can attack that young man? I think not. -May-- - I'll be fine, ma'am. Just get to safety. Plow through them. Show's starting. - You okay? - I think so. Go! Through the theater. Get as far away as you can. Yes, run along now, ladies. Pull. Sydney, I think they're canceling tonight's show. - What's wrong? - My arm hurts. May? Call an ambulance. Only six, huh? What? Lizard and Goblin had Knicks tickets? Gotta get some altitude, deal with them one at a-- Let's start by grounding this bird. Fool, this dog's not too old to learn your tricks. My tech is protected by reinforced steel. In fact, none of your former methods will work on us a second time. And the Yankees win the pennant. I hate to admit it, but I can't beat these guys together. Gotta bail. Not again. I don't think I can fit. And I don't do good in tunnels. Keep the police busy. We'll handle the wet work. - How are we supposed to spot the bug? - Maybe this will help. I'm pleased you've learned to conduct your power safely through water... ...but down here you present a danger to the group. Head back up. - But the Spider-Freak-- - Maxwell... Yeah, doc. Okay. Hey, I'm turning to Mudman here. Can I go too? - Amateurs. - Who you calling an amateur? Nope, it's not Pete or Flash. Kenny? Of course not. I'd never do that to you. A hint? Well, he is someone I met at the formal. And here he is now. Gotta go. The whole thing's Spider-Man's fault. New York never saw supervillains till the superhero showed up. - Where's Parker? - Update from Times Square. Plenty of property damage, no serious injuries. - One elderly woman had a heart attack. - Well, give me a name, Robbie. - The people wanna know who to pity. - May Parker. That's Peter's Aunt May. I have to call him. No! No, I'll call Peter myself. Jonah, calling to yell at me for not getting pics... ...of those bozos beating me up. That we don't need. I'll set it for 9 p.m. Subway should get Aunt May home by then. I wanna make sure she's okay. Now we really have to get that woman a cell phone. Oh, man. I wish I could just wake up tomorrow... ...with doc and his merry morons back in jail. Oh, you have reached the home of May... - And Peter. -...Parker. Please leave a message and we'll call back. Peter, it's Anna again. Please call. What are they doing now? I think they're having dinner. To Spider-Man's ignominious defeat. Defeat? Seems to me a job ain't done till it's done. I was topside. You yahoos lost the creep. Next time, I smash him myself. What's with you and revenge? All I ever wanted was a decent score. This obsession with Spider-Man is a distraction. It's Osborn who's truly earned my wrath. I'm calling Mr. H. See if he'll give the okay to ditch you sorry-- Stop. What are you doing? I need a cure... ...but the only way to get what we want is to trust the doc. Thank you, Electro. Yes, gentlemen, and Rhino, we're frustrated. But the arachnid will be crushed. How? He's long gone. We simply engineer a situation... ...that forces Spider-Man to play the hero. He'll come. He can't help himself. Check, please. - On the house, sir? - How kind of you. And wise. The escaped convicts have left Times Square... ...and have now taken hostages at the Metro Bank near Central Park. He's back, boys. Well, doc, you was right. Guess some folk are just too dumb to live. Rhino, you won the coin toss. Will you crush his skull or simply impale his heart on your horn? Impale. impale sounds good. What's the matter, web creep? Too scared to crack a last joke? I'll finish him. Glad you came out tonight, Mary Jane. But won't Pete be bummed? He knows we're not exclusive. Still, he was crushing pretty hard at the dance. Well, what's the deal with you two? Same old story. Two kids who grew up together. Our moms were best friends, our dads were partners. They had a startup lab in Queens. Then the four of them went to a conference together. And there was this funny little plane crash. I'm sorry. I didn't know. Well, stuff happens. Hey, slow down, chief. I've always kind of been his big brother. Kept the bullies off his back. So, in gratitude, Pete took pictures... ...to profit off our bosses' pain. Okay, not fun anymore. Stop. Stop. Stop right now. Don't you wanna know how the story ends? Pete may not be perfect, but whatever his faults... ...he's twice the man you'll ever be. Morales, Wingard, secure the hostages in the bank. Carter, DeWolff, with me. I'm gonna fry you for that, freak. That's it. - Oh, man. - Dang it. Keep shooting. Move in, kid. I got you covered. Get him off. What the heck happened to O'Hirn? Sandman, help Electro. Get him off! I'm trying. Turn down the juice. Wait. He's trying to escape again. Vulture, move! I don't wanna take out another of our own. Stop! I will not stand for-- What the boot hill--? Why you-- Dodge this! I knew you were finally getting serious... ...when you stopped cracking your pathetic little jokes. Just as I knew you would expend your energies fighting my allies... ...leaving you open for Dr. Octopus to deliver the coup de gréce. Now, I do believe we promised Rhino an impalement. Get him off. Apologies, Rhino. We're doing this my way. Your new suit interests me, arachnid. I'm going to enjoy peeling it away for further study. - He's gonna-- - Spider-Man, stop! It's over. Oh, man, the alarm didn't go off. I've been asleep for, oh, nine hours. So why am I still exhausted? I don't remember taking this much punishment in Times Square. Where did that one come from? After the day she had yesterday, we'll let her sleep a bit longer. "Spidey Stops Sinister Six"? "Photos by Peter Parker"? I don't remember any of this. It's like I slept through the whole fight. This wasn't me wearing the suit. This was the suit wearing my body. This alien, it's some kind of symbiote. Still, what do we care? The six were put down hard. Parker gets paid for the photos. What else matters? Pete. Where have you been? Your aunt-- She's still asleep upstairs. No, Peter. She had a heart attack last night. She should be okay, but she's in the hospital.
