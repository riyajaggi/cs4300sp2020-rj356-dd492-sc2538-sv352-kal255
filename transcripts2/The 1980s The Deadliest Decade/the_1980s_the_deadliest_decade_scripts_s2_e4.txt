 Reporter ♪3: MARK DAVID CHAPMAN WAS AN OBSESSED FAN. HE CARRIED A COPY OF "CATCHER IN THE RYE." Man: HE SAID, "NOW, WHENEVER ANYONE THINKS OF LENNON, THEY'LL THINK OF ME." [ CLOCK TICKS, ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ] ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: SIX YEARS AFTER THE MURDER OF JOHN LENNON, THE VIOLENCE OF THE '80s IS STILL DOMINATING THE NEWS. AMERICANS LOOKING FOR AN ESCAPE FIND IT IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF TELEVISION. FAMILY SITCOMS LIKE "COSBY" AND "FAMILY TIES" DOMINATE THE RATINGS. AH, THANK YOU. Nolan: EVERY NIGHT, AT 8:00, ALL OF AMERICA WAS PUTTING THE DISHES AWAY AND GETTING TO SIT DOWN AND WATCH ONE OF THREE OR FOUR COMEDY SHOWS ON TELEVISION. Narrator: THE APPETITE FOR SITCOMS SEEMS BOUNDLESS, BUT ACTING ROLES ARE LIMITED. THE LANDSCAPE OF TV NETWORKS IN THE '80s WAS VERY DIFFERENT. THERE WERE ONLY THREE NETWORKS. IT WAS DEFINITELY TOUGHER TO GET WORK IN THE '80s FOR ACTORS. Narrator: 18-YEAR-OLD REBECCA SCHAEFFER IS ONE OF LEGIONS OF YOUNG ACTRESSES STRUGGLING TO BREAK INTO HOLLYWOOD. SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAD WHAT I CALL "IT." Lusch: SHE JUST HAD A NATURAL TALENT. SHE REALLY SHINED WHEN YOU WERE IN A ROOM WITH HER, AND SHE WAS VERY PRESENT AND VERY FOCUSED. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: REBECCA IS BORN IN EUGENE, OREGON, THE ONLY CHILD OF DANNA AND BENSON SCHAEFFER. FROM A YOUNG AGE, HER PARENTS ENCOURAGE HER FEARLESS SPIRIT. REBECCA, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, WAS A QUIET, INDEPENDENT PERSON. I USED TO TAKE HER TO THE PLAYGROUND. SHE PARTICULARLY LIKED TO CLIMB THE MONKEY BARS, AND I REMEMBER SHE CLIMBS ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP, AND SHE STANDS UP. SHE SAYS, "I AM NOT AFRAID." SHE WASN'T AFRAID TO TRY ANYTHING JUST LIKE HORSEBACK RIDING. SHE JUST HOPPED RIGHT IN. Narrator: AND WITH THAT SAME SPIRIT, SHE MAKES THE LEAP INTO ACTING. Benson: I THINK IT WAS FIFTH OR SIXTH GRADE. A FRIEND SAID, "YOU KNOW, REBECCA WAS REALLY VERY GOOD. SHE STARRED IN 'FREE TO BE... YOU & ME.'" AND WE SAID, "YES. WHAT," BECAUSE REBECCA HAD JUST DONE IT AND NOT TOLD US. Narrator: BY THE TIME SHE TURNED 17, MODELING JOBS PAVED THE WAY FOR REBECCA TO LAND SMALL ACTING ROLES IN NEW YORK CITY. Benson: SHE WOULD POUND THE PAVEMENT THERE AND GO FOR AUDITIONS. SHE GOT A PART IN A SOAP OPERA CALLED "ONE LIFE TO LIVE." ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: ON HER OWN IN NEW YORK, REBECCA EASILY ATTRACTS NEW FRIENDS. Nolan: REBECCA WAS THAT KIND OF PERSON THAT, IF YOU WERE STUCK WITH THEM IN AN ELEVATOR, BY THE TIME THEY CAME AND RESCUED YOU, YOU WOULD HAVE EACH OTHER'S ADDRESSES AND PHONE NUMBERS, AND YOU'D BE PEN PALS FOR YEARS. Lusch: WE MET AT AN AUDITION, AND SHE WAS DARLING. SHE WAS COMING OUT OF THE ROOM, KIND OF STEPPING OVER THOSE CAMERA CORDS AND LAUGHING AND, YOU KNOW, ADORABLE. AND THEN WE BECAME FAST, VERY, VERY CLOSE FRIENDS, AND WE'D MEET EACH OTHER FOR COFFEE. WE'D TAKE YOGA CLASSES. WE'D GO TO BOOKSTORES AND READ. WE WENT TO MOVIES ALL THE TIME. Narrator: REBECCA DREAMS OF SOMEDAY STARRING IN THOSE MOVIES, SO IN 1986, AFTER TWO YEARS OF SMALL ROLES IN THE BIG APPLE, SHE STARTS TAKING TRIPS TO THE MECCA FOR ACTORS, HOLLYWOOD. ♪♪♪♪ Cameron: THE FIRST TIME I MET REBECCA, SHE DIDN'T WALK. SHE BOUNCED IN LIKE THE HAPPIEST, CUTEST BALL I'D EVER SEEN. Narrator: SUE CAMERON REPRESENTS A- LIST '80s CELEBRITIES LIKE WONDER WOMAN LYNDA CARTER AND NOW DECIDES TO TAKE A CHANCE ON REBECCA. IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT REBECCA WAS GOING TO BE A STAR, AND I DON'T USE THAT WORD LOOSELY. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: CASTING DIRECTORS TAKE NOTICE. SHE QUICKLY LANDS SMALL TELEVISION ROLES, INCLUDING A BIT PART IN STEVEN SPIELBERG'S TV SERIES "AMAZING STORIES." WHAT ARE YOU, A PUNISHMENT FOR SOMETHING I DID IN A FORMER LIFE? AND THEN AN UNBELIEVABLE OPPORTUNITY -- A SCREEN TEST FOR A STARRING ROLE IN A NEW PRIME TIME FAMILY SITCOM. Nolan: THIS IS REALLY HER DREAM COME TRUE, AND SHE GOES, AND SHE NAILS THE AUDITION. SHE GOT THE ROLE OF A LIFETIME. Narrator: REBECCA MOVES INTO THE BIG LEAGUES AND RELOCATES TO LOS ANGELES FOR GOOD. ♪♪ EVERYTHING STARTS LIKE A KNOCK AT THE DOOR ♪♪ ♪♪ YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ♪♪ THIS IS A GAME CHANGER -- REBECCA CO-STARRING ALONGSIDE PAM DAWBER. PAM DAWBER WAS HUGE IN THE '80s. SHE WAS COMING OFF OF "MORK & MINDY." YOU SHOW ME YOURS. I'LL SHOW YOU MINE. NEVER! IT'S ENERGIZING HAVING SOMEONE LIVE WITH YOU WHO HAS BIG DREAMS. ROCK STAR! WHAT HAPPENED TO SENATOR? THAT WAS LAST WEEK. DREAMS, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. CAN I GET MY NOSE PIERCED? DREAM ON, KID. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: WHEN "MY SISTER SAM" PREMIERS IN OCTOBER, IT'S A BREAKOUT HIT, AND REBECCA IS, TOO. SAM, THERE IS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY HERE. I COULD SELL THESE TO THE KIDS AT SCHOOL. Cameron: SEASON ONE OF "MY SISTER SAM" PUT REBECCA ON THE MAP. SHE WAS THE PICK TO CLICK. Troutman: THEY GOT THE COVER OF TV GUIDE. IT WAS A PRESTIGIOUS THING. THEY DON'T PUT YOU ON THE COVER OF TV GUIDE IF YOU'RE NOT IN A HIT SHOW. YOU'RE A 19-YEAR-OLD GIRL, AND YOU'RE ON THE COVER OF SEVENTEEN MAGAZINE, PRETTY BIG STUFF. Howard: I THINK THERE WAS NO STOPPING HER. SHE WAS GOING TO THE TOP. ♪♪♪♪ REBECCA SCHAEFFER, SO YOUNG, SO PRETTY, SO CHARMING. SO ALL THE BEST FROM CBS AND A HAPPY HOLIDAY TO YOU. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: EVEN AS REBECCA CATAPULTS TO STARDOM, SHE REMAINS GROUNDED. SHE DROVE A RED TRUCK, A LITTLE RED TRUCK, AND SHE HAD ROLLER SKATES IN THE BACK OF IT, SO IN SOME WAYS, SHE WAS JUST SWEET AND NAIVE. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: THE FOCUSED YOUNG ACTRESS SPENDS 12-HOUR DAYS ON THE SET AT WARNER BROS. STUDIO. I'D HANG AROUND. THEY'D DO RETAKES AND RETAKES AND RETAKES, BUT SHE WAS ACTUALLY KNOWN AS ONE-SHOT SCHAEFFER BECAUSE SHE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE LEARNING LINES. REBECCA WAS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF YOUNG ACTOR BECAUSE SHE WAS INTERESTED IN THE WORK. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: IN AN ERA OF HARD-CHARGING, PARTY-GOING, YOUNG CELEBRITIES LIKE ROB LOWE AND DEMI MOORE, REBECCA IS THE ANTI-BRAT PACKER. ♪♪♪♪ REBECCA WAS NEVER INTO THE PARTYING OR THAT LIFESTYLE. THERE WAS NO NEED TO EVEN SAY, "DON'T BRING DRUGS AROUND HER." SHE WAS WELL-ROUNDED. SHE SAT AT HOME AND DID CRAFTS. SHE WROTE POETRY. Narrator: REBECCA ALSO SPENDS TIME WRITING BACK TO HER FANS. Troutman: REBECCA GOT A LOT OF FAN MAIL, AND SHE WOULD ANSWER ALL THAT FAN MAIL HERSELF. Cameron: SHE WOULD READ THE LETTERS TO ME, AND THEY WERE WONDERFUL, "I LOVE YOU. WILL YOU BE MY PEN PAL," THAT KIND OF STUFF, AND I SAID TO HER, "REBECCA, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FAN MAIL. THEY ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS, AND FANS DON'T KNOW THAT. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THE FACE IN THE BOX ISN'T COMING OVER TO THEIR HOUSE, AND IT CAN BE DANGEROUS IF YOU ANSWER BACK." AND SHE WENT, "NO, NO, I LOVE THEM. THEY LOVE ME. I FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY." Narrator: EVEN A FAN THAT GOES SO FAR AS TO PROPOSE MARRIAGE GETS A RESPONSE BACK. HE GETS A PICTURE BACK WITH A NICE NOTE ON IT. Howard: IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HER TO HAVE THE RESPECT BACK TO THE PEOPLE WHO SHOWED HER RESPECT. ♪♪♪♪ [ CLOCK TICKS, ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ] ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: ONE AFTERNOON, WHILE REBECCA IS INSIDE THE BURBANK STUDIO FILMING "MY SISTER SAM," A STRANGER APPEARS AT THE GATE ASKING TO SEE HER. THERE, HE MET JACK EGGER, WHO WAS THE HEAD SECURITY GUY. THIS GUY SHOWS UP WITH A TEDDY BEAR AND CHOCOLATE, AND HE'S COME ALL THE WAY FROM ARIZONA. AND HE SAID THAT REBECCA WANTED TO SEE HIM BECAUSE SHE HAD ANSWERED. HE GOT A LETTER FROM HER, AND HE WANTED TO GIVE HER THESE FLOWERS. AND I WAS THERE IN THE TRAILER, AND I SAID, "ABSOLUTELY NOT. SEND HIM AWAY. DO NOT LET HIM ANYWHERE NEAR US." NOWADAYS, THAT GUARD WOULD'VE BEEN NOTIFYING THE POLICE, EVERYBODY, HER MOTHER, HER FATHER. Narrator: BUT THIS IS 1987. UNLESS FANS MAKE OVERT THREATS, THEY'RE SHRUGGED OFF. Howard: YOU HEAR, "OH, A FAN GOT ON THE SET AND WANTED AN AUTOGRAPH OR WANTED TO MEET SOMEBODY." I CERTAINLY DIDN'T, BEFORE THAT TIME, GO TO ANY MISCHIEVOUS, SCARY PLACE. Saunders: JACK SAID, "WELL, WHERE ARE YOU STAYING? I'LL DRIVE YOU BACK TO THE HOTEL." HE ACTUALLY DROVE HIM. ♪♪♪♪ Troutman: AND HE WENT AWAY, AND I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING ABOUT IT AFTER THAT. WE THOUGHT IT WAS HANDLED. Narrator: BUT THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR VOWS THAT HE WILL RETURN. KNOWING THAT IT'S COMING IS SOMETHING YOU CAN PREPARE FOR, DO SOMETHING ABOUT, BUT WHEN YOU DON'T, THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO. ♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪ LAST FALL, I RECEIVED SEVERAL PIECES OF UNSOLICITED CORRESPONDENCE SIGNED JOHN W. HINCKLEY. Reporter: PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN WAS SHOT AS HE WAS LEAVING THE WASHINGTON HILTON HOTEL. Reporter ♪2: HINCKLEY BROUGHT THE NOVEL "CATCHER IN THE RYE" WITH HIM, THE SAME BOOK CARRIED BY JOHN LENNON'S ASSASSIN, MARK DAVID CHAPMAN. ♪♪♪♪ [ CLOCK TICKS, ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ] ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: WITH A SUCCESSFUL SEASON ONE OF "MY SISTER SAM" UNDER HER BELT, REBECCA SCHAEFFER'S POPULARITY IS STEADILY GROWING. HER CAREER WAS ON AN UPWARD TRAJECTORY. WE STARTED FINDING OTHER JOBS FOR HER TO DO WHEN SHE WASN'T DOING "MY SISTER SAM." SHE DID A 4-HOUR MINISERIES CALLED "THE ACHILLE LAURO," WHICH SHE SHOT IN ITALY. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: WHEN "MY SISTER SAM" RESUMED SHOOTING FOR THE SECOND SEASON IN 1987, SOMETHING NEW ENTERS REBECCA'S LIFE -- ROMANCE. SHE MET A REALLY NICE, YOUNG MAN NAMED BRAD SILBERLING. Narrator: THE YOUNG ACTRESS AND THE ASPIRING FILM DIRECTOR ARE SET UP ON A BLIND DATE. REBECCA HAS BRAD AT "HELLO." Troutman: HE JUST LOVED HER TO PIECES, JUST THOUGHT THE WORLD REVOLVED AROUND HER. Narrator: THE ATTRACTION IS MUTUAL. BRAD WAS, I THINK, HER FIRST BIG LOVE. THEY WERE A DARLING COUPLE. BYE. BYE. DO YOU GUYS WANT TICKETS TO OUR NEXT DATE? Narrator: IN THE FALL, CBS MOVES "MY SISTER SAM" TO A NEW TIME SLOT OPPOSITE THE NBC HIT SERIES "THE FACTS OF LIFE." ♪♪ YOU TAKE THE GOOD, YOU TAKE THE BAD, YOU TAKE THEM BOTH ♪♪ Narrator: THE NETWORK HOPES TO STEAL SOME OF THAT BLOCKBUSTER'S AUDIENCE, BUT IT CAN'T COMPETE. THE RATINGS STARTED TO DROP, AND NOBODY REALLY KNEW WHY BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A SHOW THAT WOULD LAST FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. THE SHOW'S AUDIENCE DWINDLES TO ONE OF THE LOWEST ON THE NETWORK, AND IN 1988, IT'S CANCELED. Troutman: SO SHE WAS SAD. SHE REALLY ENJOYED DOING THE SHOW, BUT SHE DIDN'T LET IT GET HER DOWN. YOU KNOW, SHE KNEW THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING AROUND THE CORNER. ♪♪♪♪ IT WAS SURPRISING, BUT BY THAT TIME, IT DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE REBECCA'S CAREER WAS ABSOLUTELY LAUNCHED. HER GOAL WAS TO BE IN MOVIES. HOW MUCH LONGER DO WE HAVE TO HAVE DADDY AT THE TABLE? Narrator: SOON AFTER "MY SISTER SAM" IS CANCELED, REBECCA LANDS A STARRING ROLE IN THE DARK COMEDY "SCENES FROM THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS." WHEREAS ON "MY SISTER SAM," IT WAS A WHOLESOME CBS SITCOM, THIS WAS A FEATURE WITH MUCH MORE EDGY TAKE ON LIFE. WILL, YOU NEED TO GET A GIRLFRIEND BEFORE YOU TURN INTO A PERVERT. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: CELEBRATING HER SUCCESS, REBECCA MOVES INTO AN APARTMENT IN THE CENTRAL L.A. NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED FAIRFAX. THE AREA WHERE REBECCA LIVED ON SWEETZER WAS A VERY SOUGHT-AFTER AREA IN WEST HOLLYWOOD. Narrator: THERE'S ONE MINOR FLAW. THAT THE INTERCOM DIDN'T WORK IN THE BUILDING. ♪♪♪♪ BUT THE LAST THOUGHT ON REBECCA'S MIND IS OF THE DANGER THAT LURKS OUTSIDE. [ CLOCK TICKS, ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ] ON TUESDAY, JULY 18TH, 1989, THE 21-YEAR-OLD IS SCHEDULED TO MEET WITH DIRECTOR FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA ABOUT A ROLE IN "THE GODFATHER: PART III." HER MIND WAS FILLED WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR THE BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT. THIS WAS GOING TO BE IT FOR HER. Howard: IT WAS A COVETED ROLE. IT WAS A BUZZED-ABOUT MOVIE. IT WAS AN IMPORTANT AUDITION. SHE HAD WORKED REALLY TIRELESSLY ON THE AUDITION AND HAD AN APPOINTMENT AT PARAMOUNT THAT MORNING. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: REBECCA ANXIOUSLY WAITS FOR A SCRIPT TO BE DELIVERED IN PREPARATION FOR THE 11:00 A. M. MEETING. FOR REBECCA TO BE DIRECTED BY FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA, THAT PUTS THE SEAL OF APPROVAL ON HER FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.

THEIR PLANNED FUTURE TOGETHER IS LOOKING BRIGHT. ♪♪♪♪ AROUND 10:15, THE BUZZER RINGS.

I SAW REBECCA LYING THERE, AND IT WAS BOTH REBECCA AND NOT REBECCA. YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THE HORROR. Narrator: AS POLICE PROCESS THE SCENE, THERE ARE NO OBVIOUS CLUES AS TO WHO MURDERED THE POPULAR 21-YEAR-OLD ACTRESS. Reporter: IT'S NOT KNOWN WHY SHE OPENED THE DOOR OR IF SHE KNEW THE PERSON WHO SHOT HER. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE GUN, SO NO FINGERPRINTS THAT THEY KNEW OF. BACK IN '89, THERE WERE NO COMPUTERS REALLY THAT POLICE WERE USING, SO IT WAS DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER POLICE AGENCIES. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS QUESTION NEIGHBORS, HOPING TO FIND OUT MORE. SEVERAL OF THEM HAD SAID THEY HAD SEEN THE MAN KIND OF LURKING AROUND THE APARTMENT ALL DAY, KIND OF FIDGETING, NERVOUS.

THERE WAS A GUNSHOT BEFORE THAT AND A SCREAM BEFORE THAT. THE WOMAN WAS DEAD, SHOT INSIDE OF THE FRONT DOOR. I THINK EVERYONE WAS SHOCKED. I REMEMBER IT BEING A HUGE STORY IN THE MEDIA. IT WAS THE TOP OF EVERY NEWSCAST. IT WAS FRONT PAGE. IT WAS VERY SHOCKING. THE MURDER ABSOLUTELY PUT REBECCA IN A HUGE SPOTLIGHT. IT WASN'T THE SPOTLIGHT SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE. ♪♪♪♪ I WAS SITTING LITERALLY IN THE OFFICE WHEN WE SPOKE WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

WE WERE WORKING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THE DETECTIVES RIGHT FROM THE VERY START. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: AS IN ANY INVESTIGATION, POLICE ARE ALSO EXPLORING THOSE CLOSEST TO REBECCA, INCLUDING HER BOYFRIEND, BRAD SILBERLING.

THAT MEANS THAT ROBERT BARDO HAD TO WORK A WEEK AND A HALF ALL DAY, EVERY DAY, MOPPING FLOORS, JUST TO GET REBECCA SCHAEFFER'S ADDRESS. THAT'S HOW OBSESSED HE WAS. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: THIS TIME, WHEN BARDO WENT TO CALIFORNIA TO MEET HIS UNREQUITED LOVE INTEREST, HE WAS ARMED WITH INFORMATION AND A GUN. THE GUN WAS BOUGHT FOR HIM IN ARIZONA BY HIS BROTHER. Saunders: BARDO GAVE HIM THE MONEY. THEY ACTUALLY WENT TO THE GUN SHOP TOGETHER.

HE GOES BACK AGAIN TO REBECCA SCHAEFFER'S, AND HE RINGS HER UP. ♪♪♪♪ Clark: HE HAD A GUN BEHIND HIS BACK. [ BUZZER ] THAT SHOWED LYING IN WAIT. THAT SHOWED HE WAS TAKING HER BY AMBUSH. SHE COMES DOWN TO THE DOOR AGAIN. SHE OPENED IT, AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD, HE SHOT HER ONCE THROUGH THE HEART. [ SCREAMS, GUNSHOT ] ♪♪♪♪ AND THEN HE DESCRIBES HOW SHE LOOKED AT HIM. Narrator: IN A CHILLING TAPED INTERVIEW, BARDO DETAILS HIS LOVE-HATE OBSESSION WITH THE ACTRESS AND REENACTS THE SHOOTING LIKE A GUNSLINGER IN A WESTERN MOVIE. LIKE THIS. [ IMITATES GUNSHOT ] THE CELEBRITY NATURE OF IT, THE FAME, THE GOING BACK TO CHAPMAN'S COMMENT ABOUT, "WHENEVER ANYBODY THINKS OF LENNON, THEY'LL THINK OF ME." Narrator: CLARK MAKES THE CASE THAT THE DISTURBING UNSENT LETTERS THAT BARDO HID IN HIS ATTIC ARE PROOF THAT HE KNEW RIGHT FROM WRONG.

THERE ISN'T A DAY THAT I DON'T THINK OF THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT WE DID TOGETHER. I WILL NEVER FORGET IT. IT'S IMPRINTED IN MY MIND. HOW COULD ANYBODY TAKE THIS BEAUTIFUL, SWEET, YOUNG LADY WHO WAS SO KIND, WHO WOULD NEVER HURT ANYBODY, WHO WOULD GIVE SOMEBODY THE SHIRT OFF HER BACK? THE LOSS OF THAT LITTLE ANGEL IS SOMETHING FROM WHICH YOU DO NOT RECOVER. Clark: IF THERE'S ANY SILVER LINING TO BE FOUND IN A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS, IT IS THAT STALKING LAWS WERE ENACTED AS A RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. ALL OF US ARE SAFER. Narrator: AS THE '80s COME TO A CLOSE, REBECCA'S TRAGIC DEATH RESULTS IN ACTIONS INTENDED TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING DECADES LESS DANGEROUS. IN 1990, CALIFORNIA ADOPTS THE FIRST-EVER ANTI-STALKING BILL.
