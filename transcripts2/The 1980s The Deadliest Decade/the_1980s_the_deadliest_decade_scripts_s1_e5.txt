 INVESTIGATORS HAVE LITTLE TO GO ON. SOME JEWELRY, A KNIFE, RUBBER GLOVES. IT BECAME THIS WEIRD PUZZLE, WEIRD MAZE, AND IT ENDED TRAGICALLY. JUST SAY NO. BIG MONEY. IN THE MID-1980s, IT'S MORE THAN THE AMERICAN DREAM. IT'S THE AMERICAN OBSESSION. WE CONSUME SO MUCH. THERE'S SO MANY THINGS TO BUY. TOPPING THE CHARTS IS THE BANGLES, AND ON TOP OF THE WORLD IS "WALL STREET'S" GORDON GEKKO. AND IF YOU NEED A FRIEND, GET A DOG.

 THERE'S NO PLACE WALL STREET GREED IS MORE RICHLY REWARDED THAN HERE -- NEW YORK, NEW YORK. YOU HAVE TO GO RIGHT DOWN TO WALL STREET, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT WAS ALL HAPPENING. THE STOCK MARKET WAS BOOMING, IT WAS GROWING. REAL ESTATE WAS BOOMING. MAKING A DEAL IS AN ART FORM. PEOPLE HAVE IT OR DON'T HAVE IT. NEW YORK CITY IN THE '80s WAS A PLACE THAT WAS CONSIDERED A CITY OF EXCESS. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT AND EVERYTHING'S OKAY. 68 MILES NORTH OF WALL STREET, A WORKER AT A CAR WASH IN NEWBURGH, NEW YORK, IS THROWING OUT THE TRASH WHEN SOMETHING CATCHES HIS EYE. HE FOUND A NUMBER OF REALLY DISTURBING THINGS -- A KNIFE, ROPE, WOMEN'S CLOTHING. ALONG WITH A DRIVER'S LICENSE. 44-YEAR-OLD DIANE PIKUL. AND IT JUST SEEMED REALLY WEIRD, JUST SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING OFF. WHAT IS THIS DOING HERE? YOU JUST DON'T THROW THESE TYPES OF THINGS OUT. THERE'S SOMETHING -- SOMETHING WRONG. DIANE PIKUL, NEE WHITMORE, GREW UP IN THE SMALL INDUSTRIAL CITY OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA. BUT SHE ALWAYS DREAMED OF ESCAPING HER MIDWESTERN ROOTS FOR A MORE GLAMOROUS LIFE. SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL, AMBITIOUS, CREATIVE, AND REALLY EXCITED ABOUT HER FUTURE. SHE WAS AN ASPIRING WRITER. SHE HAD BIG DREAMS. IN 1965, SHE GRADUATES FROM MOUNT HOLYOKE WITH AN ENGLISH DEGREE. SHE WAS A GOOD WRITER. DIANE GOT A LOT OF HER SATISFACTION AND RESOLUTION FROM WRITING HER FICTION SHORT STORIES. AFTER GRADUATION, SHE SETS OFF FOR THE ONE CITY THAT'S AS BIG AS HER DREAMS. SHE WANTED TO MAKE A LIFE FOR HERSELF IN NEW YORK CITY. SHE WAS TRYING TO CREATE THE KIND OF LIFE THAT WAS THE DREAM. SHE WAS JUST PRECIOUS. SHE HAD LITTLE RINGLETS LIKE SHIRLEY TEMPLE. SHE HAD A BEAMING SMILE AND JUST A JOYOUS PERSON. WHILE DIANE STRIVES TO SUCCEED AS A WRITER, SHE PICKS UP A PLUM DAY JOB AS A SECRETARY AT LIFE MAGAZINE. THERE, SHE'S EXPOSED TO THE FINER THINGS IN LIFE AND DEVELOPS AN APPETITE FOR LUXURY. AS THE 1980s DAWN, SHE MEETS A MAN WHO CAN SATISFY IT -- WEALTHY STOCK ANALYST JOE PIKUL. JOE WAS VERY CHARISMATIC AND HE COULD REALLY DRAW YOU IN. THEIR ATTRACTION IS MUTUAL. FROM THE START, THEY LED A PRETTY HAPPY LIFE TOGETHER. SHE GOT INVOLVED WITH JOE RIGHT AWAY, AFTER A FEW WEEKS. THEY WERE OFF TO THE RACES RIGHT AWAY. IT WAS SORT OF A CASE OF OPPOSITES ATTRACT. SHE WAS THIS FREE-SPIRIT WRITER AND SORT OF ASPIRING AND STILL BUILDING HER CAREER AND HE HAD MADE IT ALREADY. HE WAS INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL AND SORT OF RULING WALL STREET IN MANY WAYS AND TO DIANE REPRESENTED STABILITY AND SORT OF A NEW WAY OF LIFE. DIANE IS BEAUTIFUL, SHE'S SPIRITED, THE PERFECT COMPLEMENT TO JOE'S EGO. FOR DIANE, JOE'S THE ANSWER TO HER DREAMS OF A LIFE OF COMFORT. HE'S POWERFUL AND... HE'S RICH. JOE WAS SOME WALL STREET WONDER. HE WAS A GIFTED KIND OF GENIUS. HE WAS EXTREMELY SMART, MAYBE EVEN BRILLIANT IN TERMS OF STOCK MARKET. I'VE NEVER MET ANYBODY QUITE LIKE JOE PIKUL. JOE WAS NEW MONEY IN THE MAKING, AND HE EARNED HIS WEALTH THE HARD WAY. JOE GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN IN MASSACHUSETTS, A WORKING-CLASS FAMILY THAT AT TIMES STRUGGLED TO JUST PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE, BUT HE HAD VERY HIGH AMBITIONS. HE WANTED A BETTER LIFE FOR HIMSELF, AND IN THE EARLY 1960s, HE DISCOVERS HIS PATH. WORKING AS A SECURITIES ANALYST FOR STANDARD & POOR'S ON WALL STREET. WITHIN 10 YEARS, HE'S MANAGING $80 MILLION IN ASSETS, SWEETENED WITH A 10 PERCENT COMMISSION. HE MADE BIG BUCKS, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ALONG THE WAY, HE ACQUIRES THE STYLE AND SWAGGER OF A BIG-TIME WALL STREET POWER BROKER. HE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON, FROM WHAT EVERYBODY SAID, THAT HE WAS USED TO GETTING HIS OWN WAY, BEING FINANCIALLY IN A POSITION THAT HE WAS ABLE TO GET HIS OWN WAY. MICHAEL DOUGLAS' GORDON GEKKO, THAT'S BASICALLY THE WAY IT WAS. WALL STREET HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN OLD BOYS CLUB, SO ALL THESE GUYS WERE GETTING RICH AND JOE WAS PART OF THAT OLD BOYS CLUB. HE WAS SORT OF A FIXTURE IN NEW YORK CITY. HE WAS A SELF-MADE MAN WHO WAS REALLY AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME. JOE IS USED TO GETTING WHAT HE WANTS, AND HE WANTS DIANE. JUST MONTHS AFTER MEETING IN 1978, JOE AND DIANE GET MARRIED. THEY'RE KINDRED SPIRITS, BOTH HIGHLY AMBITIOUS. THEY WERE ABLE TO LIVE A LIFESTYLE THAT WAS PRETTY HIGH UP THERE FOR THE '80s. THEY HAVE A PLUSH DUPLEX IN GREENWICH VILLAGE, CLOSETS FULL OF DESIGNER CLOTHES AND BROOKS BROTHERS SUITS, AND A BUSTLING HOUSEHOLD STAFF OF MAIDS AND DRIVERS. THE PIKULS HAD A GREAT LIFESTYLE. ANYTHING THEY WANTED, THEY GOT. MONEY WAS NO OBJECT. BUT BY THE MID-1980s, NOTHING'S MORE PRECIOUS TO THE PIKULS THAN THEIR TWO CHILDREN. CLAUDIA AND BLAKE, NAMES PLUCKED RIGHT OUT OF THE POPULAR PRIME-TIME SOAP OPERA "DYNASTY." WITH JOE'S ENCOURAGEMENT, DIANE HAS TRADED IN HER WRITING ASPIRATIONS TO BE A MOTHER. HER BEST ATTRIBUTE IS HER LOVE OF THOSE CHILDREN. SHE JUST WAS A GREAT MOM. SHE LOVED THOSE KIDS TO PIECES. SO DOES JOE. HE DOTED ON HIS CHILDREN. WHATEVER THOSE KIDS WANTED, HE TRIED TO GIVE THEM. EVERY YEAR, THE WHOLE FAMILY LOOKS FORWARD TO SUMMERS AT THEIR SECOND HOME IN AMAGANSETT, LONG ISLAND, IN THE AREA FAMOUSLY KNOWN AS THE HAMPTONS. EVERY CITY HAS A VACATION LAND NEARBY THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY WEALTHY GO TO TO ESCAPE, AND THE HAMPTONS WAS PERFECT. I LIVED IN THE HAMPTONS FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS, AND WHEN I MOVED THERE, MY FRIEND GAVE ME DIANE'S PHONE NUMBER AND WE BECAME FRIENDS. THEY CAME TO DINNER PARTIES AT MY HOUSE AND WE PLAYED A LOT OF TRIVIAL PURSUIT. WE WERE HAVING A GOOD TIME. THEY WERE JUST ANOTHER HAPPY COUPLE IN THE HAMPTONS. I DIDN'T HAVE ANY AWARENESS AT ALL THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG. BY THE LATE '80s, DIANE IS GETTING RESTLESS. AFTER NINE YEARS OF MARRIAGE, SHE'S TIRED OF BEING A STAY-AT-HOME MOM. LEAVING THE KIDS ON THEIR OWN WOULD BE TOUGH, BUT SHE'S EAGER TO GET BACK TO HER WRITING CAREER. SHE LANDS A JOB AS AN EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT AT HARPER'S MAGAZINE AND SHE THRIVES. WHAT MADE HER STAND OUT, TO ME, IS THAT SHE WAS NEVER A MINUTE LATE. SHE WAS VERY SMART, FOCUSED, COMMITTED TO HER JOB. TWO CAREERS, TWO CHILDREN, TWO HOMES. THE PIKULS ARE THE CLASSIC PICTURE-PERFECT COUPLE OF THE ERA. OR SO IT SEEMS. THAT HAPPILY EVER AFTER DREAM OF THE HOUSE AND THE KIDS AND ALL OF THAT, IT ALL LOOKS LIKE AN ARGYLE SWEATER ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S INSIDE. OCTOBER 19, 1987. BLACK MONDAY. THE STOCK MARKET DROPS A BOMB BY FALLING MORE THAN 500 POINTS. BLACK MONDAY IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST POINT DROP SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. WALL STREET PANICS. IT WAS DEVASTATING. PEOPLE WERE JUMPING OUT OF WINDOWS. LIVES WERE RUINED. DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN. NEVER STOP. THE STOCK MARKET TANKED. EVERYONE STARTED LOSING GOBS AND TONS OF MONEY FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR CLIENTS. THE DECADENT LIFESTYLE OF THE DAY COMES TO A SCREECHING HALT. OVERNIGHT, JOE PIKUL LOSES A FORTUNE. JOE TOOK A HUGE FINANCIAL HIT, HUGE. HE LOST TONS OF MONEY. JOE AND DIANE DECIDE TO PUT THEIR MOST PRIZED POSSESSION ON THE MARKET -- THEIR HOME IN THE HAMPTONS. THEN, DIANE BREAKS DOWN AT WORK. SHE LEANED AGAINST THE DOORJAMB OF MY OFFICE, AND ALL THE MUSCLES IN HER FACE JUST CRUMPLED AND SHE STARTED TO SOB. I HADN'T SEEN ANY EMOTION EXCEPT BREEZY HUMOR AND DELIGHT IN HER CHILDREN, AND I HADN'T REALLY SEEN ANY EMOTION OF NOTE BEFORE THEN. AND THEN I THINK SHE JUST BRUSHED HER TEARS AWAY AND HER FACE WAS AS IT WAS BEFORE SHE BROKE DOWN SOBBING. SO VERY, VERY QUICKLY, SPLIT-SECONDLY QUICKLY, SHE COMPOSED HERSELF, WHICH WAS ASTOUNDING TO ME. SHE SAID, "WELL, THIS WEEKEND, I'M GOING OUT TO AMAGANSETT." DIANE HEADS TO THE HAMPTONS TO MEET JOE AND PREP THE HOUSE FOR SALE. IT'S THE LAST TIME ANYONE SHE WORKS WITH WILL SEE HER ALIVE. WHILE AMERICA IS REELING FROM THE STOCK MARKET CRASH OF BLACK MONDAY, DIANE PIKUL IS HEADED OUT TO THE HAMPTONS FOR THE WEEKEND TO HELP HER HUSBAND, JOE, GET THEIR SUMMER HOME READY FOR SALE. BUT COME MONDAY MORNING, DIANE DOESN'T SHOW UP FOR WORK. HER COWORKER, ANN, KNOWS SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT. SHE WOULD HAVE CALLED AS SOON AS 9:00 OR HAD SOMEBODY CALL OR SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED. I TOOK PART OF HER ROLODEX AND WE JUST STARTED CALLING. THEN, IT'S JOE. HE'S LOOKING FOR HER, TOO. JOE PIKUL KEPT CALLING, ASKING IF DIANE HAD COME IN. HE WAS ANXIOUS AND DISTRAUGHT AND CONCERNED. ANN CALLS THE POLICE. DETECTIVE BILL GLYNN PICKS UP. WHEN SHE FIRST STARTED TELLING ME ABOUT IT, I'M SAYING, "HERE'S A WOMAN THAT'S OVERREACTING." YOU KNOW, MY THOUGHTS WERE THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE JUST TAKEN THE DAY. BUT THEN ANN TELLS DETECTIVE GLYNN THAT DIANE HAS BEEN KEEPING A SECRET. SHE WAS GETTING A DIVORCE. DIANE HAS MAINTAINED THE APPEARANCE OF A PERFECT LIFE. THE TRUTH IS, ANN TELLS THE DETECTIVE, HER MARRIAGE IS TROUBLED. OVER TIME, JOE AND DIANE'S MARRIAGE STARTED TO CRACK A LITTLE BIT. THIS PERFECT PICTURE THAT THEY HAD PAINTED WAS NO LONGER TRUE. TENSIONS STARTED TO GROW. THEY WOULD BICKER AND FIGHT AND THINGS WERE JUST NOT AS THEY HAD BEEN WHEN THEY FIRST MET. DIANE WAS AGAINST JOE GETTING CUSTODY OF THE CHILDREN. SHE WAS A MOTHER TIGER FOR THOSE KIDS. DETECTIVE GLYNN ISN'T ALARMED. I SAID, "YOU KNOW, COUPLES ARGUE AND THEY FIGHT." AND I SAID, "ONCE EVERYONE COOLS DOWN, THEY COME BACK." BUT HE FEELS COMPELLED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON ANN'S CALL. I SAID, "THIS IS WHAT I'LL DO. I'LL CALL JOE PIKUL." SO I CALLED HIM. I SAID, "I'D LIKE TO COME OVER AND JUST GET INFORMATION." SO HE SAID OKAY. BUT WHEN I HUNG UP THE PHONE FROM HIM, ANOTHER DETECTIVE AT ANOTHER DESK HAD SAID, "DOES ANYONE KNOW ABOUT A PIKUL?" AND I SAID, "YEAH, I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH HIM, SO..." SHE SAID, "WELL, THIS IS NEWBURGH, NEW YORK. I FOUND DIANE PIKUL'S WALLET IN A DUMPSTER AT A CAR WASH." THE WORKER WHO FOUND THE MYSTERIOUS ITEMS HAD JUST ALERTED THE POLICE. NOW I'M GETTING A STRONG FEELING THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH DIANE. WHEN DETECTIVE GLYNN VISITS THE PIKULS' GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT, HE TELLS JOE THE NEWS ABOUT THE WALLET. JOE IS CONCERNED. SO WE SAT DOWN AND I SAID, "WHAT HAPPENED WITH DIANE? WAS SHE OUT AT THE COUNTRY HOUSE WITH YOU?" JOE TELLS GLYNN THAT HE AND THE CHILDREN RETURNED FROM THE HAMPTONS THAT MORNING WITHOUT DIANE. HE SAYS SHE STORMED OUT FRIDAY NIGHT AFTER A FIGHT THEY HAD AND DIANE HAS YET TO TURN UP. I SAID, "WHAT WAS THE FIGHT ABOUT?" HE SAID, "I FOUND A CONDOM UNDER THE BED AND THE CONDOM ISN'T MINE AND I'VE SUSPECTED ALL ALONG THAT SHE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR." JOE IS VERY UPSET. IT WASN'T HIS BRAND CONDOMS THAT HE USED. SO HE WAS PRETTY SET THAT SHE WAS HAVING A BOYFRIEND. JOE STRUCK ME AS A MAN THAT WAS VERY NERVOUS. VERY NERVOUS. SO I SAID, "WELL, WHAT HAPPENED THEN?" HE SAID, "WELL, WE STARTED YELLING AND SCREAMING AND SHE LEFT." I SAID, "AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE SHE IS?" "NO. NOT AT ALL." AFTER THEIR ARGUMENT, JOE SAYS HE WENT TO SLEEP. IN THE MORNING, WITH DIANE STILL GONE, HE SEARCHED FOR HER. BUT SHE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. IT SEEMS THAT DIANE HAS LEFT HER FAMILY TO RUN AWAY WITH HER LOVER. JOE OFFERS TO HELP FIND HER IN ANY WAY HE CAN AND GIVES DETECTIVES PERMISSION TO SEARCH THEIR HAMPTONS HOME. THEY FOUND EXACTLY WHAT JOE DESCRIBED. THEY FOUND A CONDOM UNDERNEATH THE BED, WHICH COINCIDED WITH HIS STORY THAT HIS WIFE HAD A SECRET LOVER AND WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR. BUT IN THE KITCHEN, THEY DISCOVER SOMETHING MUCH MORE CHILLING -- BLOOD STAINS ON THE FLOOR. DETECTIVES' CONCERN IMMEDIATELY TURNED TO DIANE AND HER WELL-BEING AND SAFETY. WAS SHE HURT? WAS SHE ALIVE? AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHO HAD HURT HER? WAS IT THIS SECRET LOVER, PERHAPS? IT SEEMS CLEAR. JOE PIKUL'S WIFE HAS DISAPPEARED. BUT WHERE SHE IS IS A MYSTERY. MAYBE SHE'S GONE FOREVER. WIFE AND MOTHER DIANE PIKUL HAS DISAPPEARED WITH A MYSTERY LOVER. THAT'S WHAT HER HUSBAND JOE THINKS. HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHERE HIS WIFE WAS. HE THOUGHT MAYBE SHE RAN AWAY WITH SOME OTHER FELLOW AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. BUT WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT FINDS AT THE PIKULS' HAMPTONS HOME MAKES INVESTIGATORS SUSPECT THE WORST. AFTER FINDING THE BLOOD ON THE FLOOR IN THE KITCHEN, THE POLICE LAUNCHED A SEARCH FOR DIANE. THEY BROUGHT IN DOGS AND FANNED OUT THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD SEARCHING FOR HER AND POTENTIALLY HER BODY. EVERYONE HAD A FEELING THAT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED TO DIANE. DETECTIVES COME UP EMPTY HANDED. THERE'S NO TRACE OF DIANE IN THE HAMPTONS OR A SECRET BOYFRIEND. WHERE COULD SHE BE? DETECTIVE GLYNN DISCOVERS ONE POSSIBILITY. IT TURNS OUT JOE HAS ANOTHER PLACE HE RENTS IN MANHATTAN TO ENTERTAIN. NOT FAR FROM WHERE HE WORKED, SOMETHING HE COULD WALK TO FROM HIS OFFICE. THAT MIGHT BE SOMEWHERE THEY COULD LOOK FOR HER, THAT AFTER THEIR ARGUMENT, THAT'S SOMEWHERE THAT SHE MAY HAVE GONE. DETECTIVES SEARCH JOE'S APARTMENT. THERE'S NO SIGN OF DIANE, BUT THEY STUMBLE ONTO A FIND. IT WAS ALL WOMEN'S CLOTHING IN THERE AND IT WAS LARGE CLOTHES, SO WE KNEW IT WASN'T DIANE'S CLOTHING. AND THAT'S NOT ALL. THERE WAS SEX TOYS, ALL SORTS OF PARAPHERNALIA, SOMETHING THAT WAS SO BEYOND THE PALE. THERE WAS THIS WHOLE OTHER LIFE, THIS WHOLE OTHER WORLD. IT APPEARS DIANE ISN'T THE ONLY ONE WITH A SECRET LIFE. IT LOOKS LIKE JOE HAS A MISTRESS. WHAT WAS GOING ON ON WALL STREET, WITH THE OLD BOYS CLUBS, THEY LIKE TO KEEP SECRETS. ON WALL STREET IN THAT DAY AND AGE, IT WAS GLITZ AND GLAM. THERE WERE GIRLS ON THE SIDE. THERE WAS GIRLS EVERYWHERE. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT AND YOU GO HOME AND EVERYTHING'S OKAY. IT SEEMS JOE ISN'T TELLING POLICE THE FULL STORY. LINGERIE FOUND IN HIS APARTMENT MATCHES THE ITEMS FOUND IN THE DUMPSTER WITH DIANE'S WALLET. DOES IT BELONG TO JOE'S MISTRESS? COULD SHE BE BEHIND DIANE'S DISAPPEARANCE? DETECTIVE GLYNN RETRACES THE LAST PLACES DIANE WAS SEEN, STARTING WITH HER JOB AT HARPER'S MAGAZINE. HER COWORKER ANN HELPS PAINT A CLEARER PICTURE OF THE PIKULS' TROUBLED MARRIAGE. THEY HAD BEEN FIGHTING A LOT AND SHE WAS AT THE END OF HER TETHER. SHE HAD HIRED THE WEALTHIEST, MOST FAMOUS DIVORCE LAWYER IN THE CITY, RAOUL FELDER. IT TURNS OUT MANY THINGS WERE GOING WRONG IN THE PIKULS' MARRIAGE. THE THINGS THEY SAID TO EACH OTHER WERE HORRIBLE. THEY FOUGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING. IN FACT, JOE SECRETLY RECORDED THEIR ARGUMENTS. TODAY, ONLY THE TRANSCRIPTS REMAIN. JOE WAS ANGRY DIANE TOOK A JOB AND ACCUSED HER OF NEGLECTING THE KIDS. YOU'RE TRYING TO TURN MY CHILDREN AGAINST ME. YOU TELL THEM I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM. I NEVER SAID THAT. YES, YOU DID. THEN DIANE FOUND SOMETHING THAT TOOK THEIR PROBLEMS TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL. WHILE TIDYING UP SOME OF JOE'S STUFF, SHE FOUND WOMEN'S LINGERIE AMONGST HIS BELONGINGS. IT WAS NICE, VERY EXPENSIVE LINGERIE. WHERE'D THIS COME FROM? THIS IS NOT MY LINGERIE. WHOSE LINGERIE IS THIS? THIS WAS SHOCKING TO HER AND CONFUSING AND OF COURSE UPSETTING, AND HER REACTION WAS LIKELY ANGER. AS A WIFE, ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU IS FINDING OUT THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS HAVING AN AFFAIR. THIS ENDS MARRIAGES, IT BREAKS UP FAMILIES, AND THIS IS LIKELY WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH DIANE'S HEAD AT THAT TIME AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DEVASTATING FOR HER. YOU'RE A LIAR, CHEATER. DIANE WAS SO UPSET, SHE EVEN MADE DEATH THREATS. - I DON'T CARE IF I GO TO JAIL. - I'LL KILL YOU IF I HAVE TO. AS THE INFORMATION BUILDS, SO DOES DETECTIVE GLYNN'S CONCERN. THEN, ABOUT 50 MILES NORTH OF NEW YORK CITY, TWO DAYS AFTER DIANE WAS REPORTED MISSING... SOME HIGHWAY CREWS WERE CLEANING OUT DRAINAGE DITCHES ALONG THE NEW YORK STATE THRUWAY NEAR NEWBURGH AND THEY CAME ACROSS A OBJECT WRAPPED IN A TARP, AND SOMETHING VERY ODD ABOUT IT. AND THEY GO DOWN AND INSPECT, AND TO THEIR SURPRISE, IT'S A BODY. THE BODY OF DIANE PIKUL. THERE WAS A GRIM DISCOVERY BY A MAINTENANCE CREW IN NEWBURGH TODAY. FOR DAYS, HER FRIENDS HAVE BEEN DESPERATE FOR NEWS ABOUT HER. NOW THEY'RE SHATTERED BY IT. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE. IT WAS DEVASTATING. ALL I KNOW IS THAT I COULDN'T STOP CRYING. I JUST COULDN'T STOP CRYING. COULDN'T STOP. AUTHORITIES EXAMINE DIANE'S BODY. HER WRISTS AND ANKLES ARE BOUND IN CORD AND THERE ARE MARKS AROUND HER NECK. DIANE PIKUL HAD BEEN STRANGLED. THAT WAS THE CAUSE OF DEATH. SHE'S ALSO COVERED IN BRUISES FROM A SEVERE BEATING. THE MISSING-PERSONS CASE OF DIANE PIKUL JUST BECAME A HOMICIDE. POLICE HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING THE SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE OF DIANE PIKUL, WHOSE TROUBLED MARRIAGE WAS FILLED WITH SECRETS. WITH THE DISCOVERY OF HER BODY, THE CASE HAS BEEN RULED A HOMICIDE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT MOST HOMICIDES, THE INITIAL SUSPECTS ARE USUALLY THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO THE VICTIM. LEARNING ABOUT THE MARITAL DISCORD THAT JOE PIKUL AND DIANE PIKUL HAD STEERED THE INVESTIGATION TOWARDS JOE PIKUL AS A SUSPECT. I THOUGHT JOE MIGHT HAVE A HAND IN THIS. JOE FOUGHT WITH DIANE, WAS IN THE MIDST OF A DIVORCE, AND HE WAS THE LAST PERSON WHO SAW HER ALIVE. THERE'S ENOUGH PROBABLE CAUSE FOR DETECTIVES TO TAKE ACTION. JOE IS ARRESTED AND BROUGHT IN FOR QUESTIONING. I'VE INTERROGATED A LOT OF PEOPLE DURING MY CAREER, A LOT, AND YOU GET TO BUILD A BOND WITH THEM, BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO REALLY SOLICIT ANY INFORMATION. POLICE EXPLAIN HE'LL BE PROCESSED ACCORDING TO ROUTINE. BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM. HE REFUSES TO TAKE OFF HIS CLOTHES. THIS WAS A NEW ONE FOR ME. HE WAS TRYING TO TALK HIS WAY OUT OF BEING STRIP SEARCHED. JOE TRIED AND TRIED AND TRIED TO GET OUT OF THAT STRIP SEARCH. HE BEGGED, HE PLEADED. THE POLICE INSIST. "NO, NO, NO, YOU HAVE TO DO IT, YOU HAVE TO DO IT, YOU HAVE TO DO IT." FINALLY... HE TOOK HIS CLOTHES OFF, AND WHAT WAS HE WEARING UNDERNEATH HIS STREET CLOTHES? JOE WAS A CROSS-DRESSER. AND THEN HIS SECRET WAS OUT. THE DISCOMFORT IN THE ROOM WAS PALPABLE. THE POLICE WERE KIND OF SHOCKED, CONFUSED, MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE EMBARRASSED. AND JOE WAS HUMILIATED. BUT MORE IMPORTANT, DETECTIVES WANT TO KNOW, COULD JOE'S SECRET LIFE HAVE SOMEHOW LED TO DIANE'S MURDER? AFTER MANY HOURS, THEY PRESSED THE STOCKBROKER FOR DETAILS AND HE FINALLY BREAKS HIS SILENCE. OVER A YEAR BEFORE HER MURDER, DIANE HAD DISCOVERED JOE'S SECRET. DIANE FOUND LINGERIE IN JOE'S OFFICE, AND THAT'S NOT ALL. WHAT SHE HAD WAS THESE PICTURES SHE FOUND OF HIM IN WOMEN'S LINGERIE. SHE LOOKED AT THOSE PHOTOS AND SAW HER HUSBAND, A PERSON WHO DRESSED IN THREE-PIECE SUITS, WAS ALWAYS IMMACULATELY DRESSED, AND HERE WAS THIS GUY WEARING THE DAINTIEST LINGERIE YOU COULD GET. IT WAS PRETTY SENSATIONAL. YOU CAN PICTURE HIM WITH A BROOKS BROTHERS SUIT ON WITH LINGERIE UNDERNEATH. AND THEN DIANE FINDS THE VIDEOTAPES. AND THE CONTENTS OF THOSE TAPES WERE TAPES THAT HE MADE OF HIMSELF CROSS-DRESSING IN HIS ALTER EGO OF CHLOE. THERE IS HER HUSBAND DANCING AROUND TO TINA TURNER LIKE HE'S IN HIS OWN WORLD. THESE PICTURES REPRESENTED A HUGE BETRAYAL IN THEIR MARRIAGE, A SECRET THAT HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN KEEPING FROM HER, THAT HE DIDN'T TRUST HER ENOUGH TO TELL HER. IT MUST HAVE BEEN TENSE, AND HOW MUCH COULD DIANE PRETEND THAT EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL? DIANE COULDN'T LIVE WITH THESE SECRETS. SHE COULD NOT LOOK HIM IN THE FACE AND ACT NORMALLY, SO SHE CONFRONTED HIM. HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILDREN? TOLD HIM THAT SHE KNEW ABOUT THE LINGERIE, SHE KNEW ABOUT THE VIDEOTAPE, ABOUT HIS SECRET LIFE, AND SHE SAID, "WHAT IS THIS? WHAT'S GOING ON?" JOE SAID HE HAD THIS LIFESTYLE. THERE WAS NO WAY HE COULD REALLY, REALLY CHANGE TO WHAT SHE WANTED. I AM MAD AND I AM BROKEN-HEARTED AND I TRIED AS HARD AS I COULD AND YOU KNOW IN YOUR HEART THAT I DID. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DID. WELL, THAT IS TOO BAD. AND THIS WAS DEVASTATING TO JOE. HIS LIFE WAS SORT OF CRUMBLING AROUND HIM. IN THE 1980s, MEN WHO WORK IN HIGH-POWER FINANCE DON'T DRESS IN WOMEN'S CLOTHES. THE IDEA OF A TOP FINANCIER WEARING WOMEN'S CLOTHING AND DANCING AROUND TO TINA TURNER, IT COULD RUIN HIM. JOE IS VULNERABLE AND DIANE SEIZES ON THAT. SHE WANTS A DIVORCE. I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU. I'M GOING TO HANG YOU IF YOU DON'T COOPERATE. WHAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ANGRY ARGUMENTS AND TIRADES NOW BECAME VICIOUS, CALLING HIM ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC NAMES AND REALLY ATTACKING HIM IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD. SHE CAME AT HIM SAYING, "I THINK YOU'RE GAY. I THINK YOU'RE, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE AIDS." - I PROBABLY HAVE THE AIDS VIRUS. - I'M TOO SCARED TO GET A TEST. I'M SURE I DO. YOU DO TOO. WHY? WHY? BECAUSE YOU HAD A HOMOSEXUAL ENCOUNTER. THAT IS, OF COURSE, RIDICULOUS, AND YOU KNOW IT IS. JOE NEVER DOES SAY IF HE'S GAY, BUT DIANE IS AFRAID AND SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S ACCUSING HIM OF. AIDS WAS AT THAT POINT STILL CONSIDERED A "HOMOSEXUAL DISEASE" AND WAS RUNNING RAMPANT THROUGH THE GAY COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION THAT IT IS AFFECTING, THERE WAS A LARGE STIGMA ATTACHED TO IT. IT WAS SEEN AS DIRTY AND SHAMEFUL. DIANE DELIVERS A CRUSHING BLOW WITH AN ULTIMATUM. I DON'T WANT YOU SPENDING SO MUCH TIME WITH THE CHILDREN. I THINK YOU'RE A VERY BAD INFLUENCE ON THEM. SHE WANTS FULL CUSTODY OF THEIR CHILDREN OR SHE'LL REVEAL HIS SECRET TO THE WORLD. SHE WAS GOING TO EXPOSE HIM, THE GREAT BIG WALL STREET WONDER, AND TAKE HIS CHILDREN AWAY FROM HIM. OF COURSE HE WAS THREATENED. IT JUST WOULD BE DEVASTATING FOR HIM. THE MOST VALUABLE ASSET IN JOE AND DIANE'S MARRIAGE WAS THEIR CHILDREN, AND JOE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT HE GOT CUSTODY OF THEM. JOE AND DIANE'S BITTER CONFLICT COMES TO A HEAD ON THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER 24th. BACK IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM, POLICE FIND THERE'S ONE MORE THING JOE HASN'T TALKED ABOUT -- A LONG SCRATCH ON HIS SIDE. NOW JOE CAN AT LAST REVEAL THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT. JOE PIKUL IS UNDER ARREST FOR THE MURDER OF HIS WIFE, DIANE. HE HAS REVEALED TO AUTHORITIES HIS SECRET LIFE AND HIS DISINTEGRATING MARRIAGE. AND NOW HE'S GOT ONE MORE SHOCKING PIECE OF INFORMATION TO SHARE WITH THEM. HE KILLED DIANE. HE MURDERED HIS WIFE. BUT ACCORDING TO JOE, HE HAD NO CHOICE. JOE WAS CLAIMING SELF DEFENSE. HE SHOWS POLICE A SCAR THAT BEARS OUT WHAT HE SAYS WENT DOWN THE NIGHT HE KILLED DIANE. AROUND 1:00 A. M., SHE ARRIVES AT THEIR HAMPTONS HOME. THE KIDS ARE ASLEEP BUT JOE IS WAITING UP FOR HER, AND LATE AS SHE IS, HE'S UPSET. THE TWO LAUNCH INTO A FIERCE SCREAMING MATCH THAT ONLY ESCALATES. HE GIVES A STATEMENT THAT AT SOME POINT IN TIME, DIANE GETS ANGRY WITH HIM AND GRABS THIS BIG KITCHEN KNIFE AND COMES AFTER HIM. HE TRIES TO DEFEND HIMSELF, HE GETS SLICED ON HIS BODY, THE STOMACH AREA OR SIDE AREA. HE SAID THAT HE TRIED TO PUSH HER BACK. SHE CAME AT HIM. IN HER PROCESS OF TAKING THE KNIFE, HE PUT HIS HAND ON HER THROAT AND CHOKED HER. DURING THE COURSE OF DEFENDING HIMSELF, HE ACCIDENTLY KILLS DIANE. IT'S A STUNNING STORY, ENOUGH TO CHARGE JOE WITH SECOND-DEGREE MURDER. I WAS A STAFF REPORTER AT THE NEW YORK POST. I BECAME INVOLVED WHEN THIS CASE BROKE. IT HAD WALL STREET, IT HAD THE HAMPTONS, IT HAD CROSS-DRESSING, IT HAD SEXUAL PECCADILLOS. EVERYTHING THAT MADE A GREAT TABLOID STORY, IT HAD, SO IT EXPLODED INTO A HUGE STORY. JOE HIRES RENOWNED DEFENSE ATTORNEY RON BEKOFF. ONE OF HIS CIVIL LAWYERS FROM MANHATTAN, HE HAD BUSINESS INTEREST, SENT HIM TO ME. HE JUST SAID, "I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WAS A WELL-TO-DO STOCK BROKER WHO'S GOING TO PROBABLY HAVE A CRIMINAL PROBLEM. I'D LIKE YOU TO TALK TO HIM," AND I DID. THAT SAME MONTH, BEKOFF GETS PIKUL RELEASED ON BAIL AND BACK LIVING WITH HIS CHILDREN. JOE BELIEVES HIS DEFENSE WILL PREVAIL. PROSECUTOR ALAN JOSEPH HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM. I WAS THE CHIEF ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY PROSECUTING JOSEPH PIKUL. IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST NOTORIOUS CASE THAT I HAD. THE FIRST TIME I MET JOE PIKUL, HE SEEMED TO BE A VERY CONFIDENT, COCKY INDIVIDUAL. HE PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE DOING AND... NOTHING WAS GOING TO STICK. JOE PIKUL'S MURDER TRIAL BEGINS. JOSEPH PIKUL IS THE HOTSHOT WALL STREET ANALYST WHO DRESSED OCCASIONALLY LIKE A WOMAN AND IS ACCUSED OF MURDERING HIS WIFE IN THEIR AMAGANSETT, LONG ISLAND, HOME. IN COURT, BEKOFF MOUNTS HIS DEFENSE. HE CLAIMS IT'S NOT JOE'S LIFESTYLE THAT'S ON TRIAL. HE HAD TO TAKE DIANE'S LIFE TO PROTECT HIS OWN. IN THAT DUMPSTER, THEY FOUND A BIG KNIFE, SO WE OFFERED IN EVIDENCE THAT -- "WELL, THAT'S THE KNIFE JOE TOOK AWAY FROM HER. THAT'S THE KNIFE SHE CAME AT JOE WITH." BUT THE PROSECUTION'S CASE AGAINST JOE IS COMPELLING BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID WITH HIS WIFE'S BODY AFTER HE KILLED HER. IT'S A CLOUDLESS MORNING WHEN JOE LEAVES HIS HAMPTONS HOME WITH HIS TWO YOUNG CHILDREN IN TOW. HE'S DROPPING THEM OFF WITH AN OLD COLLEGE FRIEND BECAUSE HE'S GOT AN IMPORTANT TASK TO ATTEND TO. AT THE TIME THAT IT OCCURRED, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE KIDS HAD ANY IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON. IN THE BACK OF THE PIKULS' '87 STATION WAGON IS THEIR DEAD MOTHER, DIANE. JOE STOPS AT THE LOCAL HARDWARE STORE, WHERE HE BUYS TARPS, ROPE, AND OTHER SUPPLIES TO WRAP THE BODY. HE ALSO NEEDS ICE. LOTS OF IT. JOE PIKUL BOUGHT 'EM OUT OF ICE. I MEAN, HE BOUGHT LIKE EVERY BAG OF ICE THE GUY HAD. WE ASSUME THAT WAS TO KEEP THE BODY FROM DECOMPOSING WHILE HE WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH IT. SO HE DUMPS THE KIDS WITH HIS COLLEGE BUDDY AND THEN HE HEADS UP TO MASSACHUSETTS. PROBABLY WHAT WENT THROUGH HIS MIND IS THE FURTHER AWAY FROM NEW YORK HE GETS, THE BETTER CHANCE HE HAS OF GETTING AWAY WITH THIS. JOE DRIVES ON FOR MILES IN A DAZE OF INDECISION. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE BODY. THEN, IN NEWBURGH, NEW YORK, TWO DAYS AFTER HE MURDERED DIANE... HE DUMPS THE BODY AT THE LAST MINUTE OFF OF THE THRUWAY BECAUSE HE'S OUT OF OPTIONS AT THIS POINT. HE'S GOT TO PICK THE KIDS UP AND GET BACK TO THE CITY. JOE GETS THE KIDS AND DRIVES TO A CAR WASH TO GET HIS STATION WAGON SCRUBBED DOWN, INSIDE AND OUT. HE THROWS OUT DIANE'S PURSE AND SOME WOMEN'S CLOTHES -- HIS OWN. TURNS OUT THAT THE CLOTHING WAS REALLY JOE PIKUL'S WOMEN'S CLOTHING, NOT DIANE'S. HE ALSO GETS RID OF THAT KNIFE. FOR THE PROSECUTION, JOE'S ELABORATE BEHAVIOR SEEMS EASY ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN. YOU DON'T ACCIDENTLY STRANGLE SOMEBODY. YOU DON'T GO TO THE LENGTHS THAT HE WENT TO AND THEN GO ON YOUR LIFE AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED. YOU DON'T DO THAT IF YOU ACCIDENTLY KILL SOMEBODY. THIS ALLEGED SELF-DEFENSE, BORN, I SUBMIT, IN AN ATTEMPT TO TAILOR THE FACTS TO SUPPORT A VERSION THAT MIGHT AID HIM IN BEATING THE RAP. EVERYTHING THAT WE HAD BASICALLY POINTED TOWARDS JOE PIKUL MURDERING, NOT ACCIDENTLY KILLING, DIANE PIKUL. DIANE CONFRONTING JOE PIKUL WITH THE DIVORCE... I'M SURE MADE JOE SNAP TO A CERTAIN DEGREE. HE JUST WANTED DIANE OUT OF HIS LIFE. BY MURDERING DIANE, JOE PIKUL WOULD HAVE HIS KIDS, HIS MONEY WOULD BE KEPT WITH HIM, HE WOULDN'T BE SPLITTING IT WITH ANYBODY ELSE, AND NO ONE WOULD BE ANY WISER. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE AN ATOMIC BOMB DROPPING ON THIS FAMILY. JOE'S SECRETS, THEIR FIGHTS, THE BLACK MONDAY, THE SALE OF THE HOUSE. DURING THE TRIAL, A MEDICAL EXAMINER TAKES THE STAND AND TESTIFIES THAT THE KNIFE WOUNDS ON JOE'S SIDE WERE LIKELY SELF-INFLICTED. AFTER A DAY OF DELIBERATION, THE JURY REACHES A VERDICT -- GUILTY OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER. BEFORE HE'S SENTENCED, JOE BECOMES ILL AND IS DIAGNOSED WITH AIDS. JOE NEVER CAME OUT TO ANYONE AS GAY. HIS WIFE CERTAINLY SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS, SO IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS HAVING HOMOSEXUAL AFFAIRS WHILE MARRIED TO HIS WIFE. SHORTLY AFTER, HE DIES. IN THE END, THE ULTIMATE VICTIMS WERE JOE AND DIANE'S CHILDREN, CLAUDIA AND BLAKE. DIANE'S COUSIN ADOPTED AND RAISED THEM. JOE AND DIANE PIKUL LIVED LARGE, BUT IN PRIVATE, THEY STRUGGLED. YOU'RE DEALING WITH HIGH-POWERED, VERY WEALTHY, RESPECTED PEOPLE WHOSE MARRIAGE JUST CRUMBLED, AND IT UNFORTUNATELY LED TO MURDER. WHY DID JOE MURDER DIANE? THAT'S SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE WILL EVER TRULY KNOW WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH HIS MIND. THERE'S NO QUESTION JOE WAS A TORTURED SOUL.
