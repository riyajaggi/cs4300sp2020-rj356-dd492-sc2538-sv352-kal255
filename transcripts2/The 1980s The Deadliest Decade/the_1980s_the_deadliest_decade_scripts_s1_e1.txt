 IN BOSTON'S MOST INCREDIBLE MURDER CASE. YOU NOW BELIEVE THAT STORY WAS FALSE. - IT IS NOT TRUE. - ON THE GROUND! EVERYTHING YOU THOUGHT WAS TRUE, WASN'T. IT WAS SHOCKING. IT WAS CONFUSING. IT'S DIABOLICALLY BRILLIANT. JUST SAY NO. IN A DECADE OF BIG IDEAS -- HI. I'M STEVE JOBS. 1989 IS BREAKAWAY YEAR. THE NEW RIGHT IS ON THE RISE. A NEW PRESIDENT. NEW TECHNOLOGY. - GAME BOY.

 NEW MONEY. THEY DRIVE THE BEST CARS, THEY WEAR EXPENSIVE CLOTHES, THEY DRINK GOOD WINES, AND THEY VACATION IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES. IT'S MORE THAN A TREND. YUPPIES ARE A PHENOMENON. IT'S THIS COMPETITION TO TRY AND BE THE BEST AND DO IT NOW, DO IT YOUNG. ESPECIALLY HERE. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, IS CLOSIN' IN ON HAVING THE HIGHEST PER-CAPITA INCOME OF ANY AMERICAN CITY. BUT THEN BOSTON IS ALSO RACKING UP A STAGGERING TALLY OF VIOLENT CRIMES, ALMOST 13,000 THIS YEAR. ROBBERIES, RAPE -- WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT CRIME PROBLEM, LIKE ANY BIG CITY. MURDERS WERE NOT UNCOMMON. FOR 911 DISPATCHER GARY McLAUGHLIN, THE CALLS FOR DIRE EMERGENCIES ARE BECOMING ALL TOO ROUTINE. UNTIL TONIGHT. IT BEGAN AS A TYPICAL SHIFT. THERE WAS NOTHING DRAMATIC THAT HAPPENED, UP UNTIL THAT PHONE CALL AT 2043 HOURS. WHEN THE CALLER INDICATED HE'S BEEN SHOT, IT GETS YOUR ATTENTION. FOR BOSTON PD, THEIR LOCATION IS AN URGENT QUESTION. UNH. THE WHOLE CITY WILL BE ASKING ANOTHER QUESTION SOON ENOUGH. CHUCK STUART AND HIS WIFE, CAROL, TWO NAMES THAT WILL SOON DOMINATE THE HEADLINES IN BOSTON AND ACROSS THE NATION. IT'S A FAR CRY FROM THE LOCAL COUPLE'S HUMBLE BEGINNINGS. CAROL GREW UP IN MEDFORD AND I DID, TOO. SHE WAS ONLY 2 YEARS AHEAD OF ME IN SCHOOL. HER PARENTS WERE VERY CLOSE TO MY PARENTS. MEDFORD, RIGHT OUTSIDE OF BOSTON, IS A TRADITIONAL WORKING-CLASS TOWN. CAROL WAS EXTREMELY CLOSE TO HER FAMILY. HER DAD RAN A PIZZA RESTAURANT. WE GREW UP WITH THAT OLD-FASHIONED ITALIAN FAMILY, CLOSE, YOU KNOW, AND LOVING. SHE WAS OUTGOING AND FUNNY. I MEAN, FUNNY, FUNNY THE WAY LUCILLE BALL IS FUNNY. SHE HAD A BIG HEART AND SHE'D HELP ANYBODY BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY SHE WAS RAISED. LIKE MANY WOMEN GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL IN 1977, CAROL WANTS IT ALL. SHE WANTED TO GET MARRIED. SHE WANTED CHILDREN. HER GOAL WAS TO BECOME A LAWYER. BY 1980, SHE'S ON HER WAY, PAYING FOR BOSTON COLLEGE BY WORKING AT A RESTAURANT PART-TIME. SHE BUSSED TABLES. SHE WAS A WAITRESS. THAT'S WHAT SHE DID. THAT'S WHERE SHE MEETS A MAN WHOSE AMBITION MATCHES HER OWN: CHARLES STUART. HE WAS A HANDSOME GUY, VERY ATTRACTIVE. HE WOULD WRITE HER LITTLE NOTES. HE WAS A COOK AND SHE'D PUT IN HER ORDER AND HE WOULD WRITE HER LITTLE LOVE NOTES, PASS IT BACK THROUGH THE WINDOW. SO THAT'S PRETTY DISARMING. SOON, THEY'RE SPENDING EVERY BREAK TOGETHER AND CHARLES OPENS UP ABOUT HIS LIFE. CHARLES STUART CAME FROM, NOT AN IMPOVERISHED BACKGROUND, BUT CERTAINLY NOT PROSPEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES. HE GREW UP WITH THREE BROTHERS IN REVERE, A BLUE-COLLAR SUBURB WHERE THE ONLY THING AS IMPORTANT AS FAMILY IS THE RED SOX. MATTHEW IS THE YOUNGEST ONE OF THEM ALL. MATTHEW AND CHUCK WERE VERY CLOSE. MATTHEW LOOKS UP TO HIS OLDER BROTHER AND WILL FOLLOW HIM ANYWHERE BECAUSE CHARLES HAS AMBITION. CHARLES STUART WAS THE MAN IN THE FAMILY, YOU KNOW? HE WAS THE ONE THAT EVERYONE RESPECTED, WELL ON HIS WAY TO SUCCEED, IN WAYS THAT OTHERS IN THE FAMILY HAD NOT. HE WANTED TO BE A BIG MAN IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS, ACTUALLY. HE WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE PERSON THAT CAROL DATED BEFORE. HE SEEMED MORE INTELLIGENT AND HE UNDERSTOOD HER GOAL WAS TO BECOME A LAWYER AND THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIFIC. THE MORE COMPLIMENTS YOU GET, YOU KNOW, THE HEART STARTS TO PUMP A LITTLE FASTER. CHARLES IS ATTENTIVE. HE'S DRIVEN. AND CAROL IS TAKEN BY HIM. HE WOULD WINE AND DINE HER. HE WAS EXTREMELY ROMANTIC. SHE WAS SMITTEN. CAROL WAS ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH HIM. TWO YEARS AFTER THEY'VE MET, HE'D SAVED UP ENOUGH TO PROPOSE, WITH A $4,500 ENGAGEMENT RING. IN 1985, THEY MARRIED. SHE BROUGHT IN ALL THE WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHS AND BUBBLED OVER ABOUT HOW HANDSOME CHUCK WAS. THEY HAD A SUPERB RELATIONSHIP. THEY WERE DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER. THEY WERE LIKE KEN AND BARBIE. NOW, THE STUARTS CAN LAUNCH THEIR DREAMS TOGETHER AND JOIN THE RANKS OF THE MOST EXCLUSIVE CLUB OF THE GO-GO 1980s. WHILE THE STOCK MARKET IS SURGING, SO IS THAT SELECT CLASS OF CONSUMERS WHO ARE YOUNG, PROFESSIONAL, AND KNOWN AS YUPPIES. CAROL BECOMES A TAX LAWYER AT A PRESTIGIOUS ACCOUNTING FIRM. CHARLES LANDS A PLUMB JOB, TOO. HE SOLD FURS TO HIGH-END CLIENTELE. I MEAN, HE HAD FURS IN THERE FOR $25,000 AND UP. IT'S A SALES JOB, BUT HE'S HOBNOBBING WITH THE ELITE OF BOSTON. AND IT RUBS OFF. ALL THE PEOPLE THAT CAME IN TO BUY COULDN'T WAIT TO HAVE CHUCK PAY ATTENTION TO THEM 'CAUSE HE WAS SO CHARMING. HE HAD PRESTIGE AND STATUS. CHARLES WAS DEFINITELY A YUPPIE PERSON. HE WANTED TO BE KNOWN AS THE BIG WHALE. THAT WAS HIS ATTITUDE, HIS DEMEANOR, THE WAY HE WALKED, THE WAY HE DRESSED. BY THE END OF THE DECADE, CHARLES IS MAKING $100,000 A YEAR. WITH CAROL'S SALARY, THE STUARTS CAN ENJOY THE REWARDS OF THEIR HARD WORK. THEY BUY A HOUSE WITH A JACUZZI AND A POOL AND HE SPENDS OVER $1,000 ON THE ULTIMATE '80s STATUS SYMBOL. THE LATEST INVENTION FOR PEOPLE THAT CANNOT BE WITHOUT A PHONE: A PHONE THAT CAN GO ANYWHERE AND DO ANYTHING YOUR HOME PHONE WILL. WITH ALL HIS TOYS, FOR CHARLES, SOMETHING IS MISSING. HE WANTED TO GO, YOU KNOW, INVEST IN A RESTAURANT. IT WAS JUST WHAT HE WANTED TO DO IN LIFE. BUT HE MAY NEED TO PUT HIS DREAM ON HOLD. CAROL HAS BIG NEWS: SHE'S PREGNANT. SHE WAS THRILLED TO FIND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT. SHE WAS ALL EXCITED AND HE WASN'T. YOU COULD TELL THIS WAS NOT WHAT HE PLANNED. I THINK, IN CHUCK'S HEAD, THE FAMILY INCOME WOULD CHANGE, IF SHE STOPPED WORKING. THEY JUST GOT A HOUSE AND, NOW, SHE WAS PREGNANT, SO HIS TIMETABLE WAS KINDA WIPED OUT. BUT CAROL HAS FAITH THE MAN SHE LOVES WILL COME AROUND. IT'S 8:30 PM WHEN CHARLES AND CAROL STUART LEAVE BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL IN ROXBURY. THEY JUST CAME OUT OF LAMAZE CLASS. WITH THE BABY DUE IN JUST 2 MONTHS, CHARLES NOW DOTES ON HIS PREGNANT WIFE. SHE'S ALL EXCITED BECAUSE SHE'S LOOKING FORWARD TO HER CHILD BEING BORN. IT'S A SHORT RIDE BACK TO THE SUBURBS WHERE THE STUARTS LIVE, A RIDE THAT TAKES THEM THROUGH AN AREA CALLED MISSION HILL. BACK THEN, THAT WAS CONSIDERED, YOU KNOW, TERRITORY YOU DON'T GO IN. THERE WAS A LOT OF CRIME. THERE WERE GANGS, THE CRACK EPIDEMIC. CAROL IS ANXIOUS TO GET HOME. CHARLES WAS ON TREMONT, WHICH RUNS THROUGH A DRAMATIC SECTION OF THE CITY. AT 8:40, AT A DESERTED INTERSECTION, THE CAR COMES TO A STOP. EARLY CELLPHONES HAVE NO GPS CAPABILITY. IF CHARLES CAN'T SAY WHERE HE IS, IT'LL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR McLAUGHLIN TO GET HELP TO HIM. SOMEWHERE, IN THIS 20-BLOCK RADIUS, A YOUNG COUPLE'S LIFE IS ON THE LINE. DESPERATE, THE POLICE DEVISE A PLAN. AT LEAST A HALF A DOZEN CARS WERE CONCENTRATING ON WHERE THEY THOUGHT THIS CALLER MIGHT BE. EACH CAR BLASTS ITS SIREN ON CUE, HOPING McLAUGHLIN WILL HEAR IT ON THE 911 CALL THROUGH CHARLES'S MOBILE. THEN, CHARLES'S LINE GOES QUIET. - SIRENS OVER THE -- - DO YOU HEAR THE SIREN? I CAN HEAR A SIREN. 13 AGONIZING MINUTES FROM WHEN THE CALL FIRST CAME IN, McLAUGHLIN IS ABLE TO PINPOINT THEIR LOCATION. WE WERE ABLE TO HEAR THE SIRENS. THE DUTY SERGEANT SAID, "YOU'RE RIGHT ON TOP." EMTs RUSH TO THE CAR. BUT THE SCENE IS GRIM. CHARLES STUART HAS A BULLET IN HIS GUT. CAROL IS WORSE. INJURIES TO HER WERE DEVASTATING. THE WOUND WENT THROUGH THE BACK OF HER SKULL. CHARLES STUART, HE WAS VERY SERIOUSLY WOUNDED. THERE WAS AN UNBORN CHILD INVOLVED AS WELL. POLICE PRESS CHARLES FOR ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM BEFORE SHOCK SETS IN. - TAKE CARE OF MY WIFE. IT WAS A BLACK MALE WITH A HOARSE WAY OF SPEAKING, WEARING A BLACK SWEATSUIT WITH RED STRIPES. CHARLES IS RUSHED TO BOSTON CITY; AND CAROL, TO NEARBY BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S, WHERE, JUST 2 HOURS EARLIER, SHE HAD ATTENDED A BIRTHING CLASS. NOW, SHE'S FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE. FROM BOSTON, WE HAVE A NIGHTMARE STORY OF RANDOM CRIME AND VIOLENT DEATH. VICTIMS OF A BRUTAL ATTACK, CHARLES STUART AND HIS WIFE, CAROL, ARE RUSHED INTO EMERGENCY SURGERY. SHE IS 7 MONTHS PREGNANT. IT WAS EXTREMELY EMOTIONAL, THIS PREGNANT WOMAN AND THEN, HER BABY, THE WOUNDING OF HER HUSBAND, AND THEN, THIS MYSTERIOUS, BLACK, MALE PERPETRATOR THAT NOBODY CAN SEEM TO FIND. WHILE THE STUARTS ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES, NEWS OF THEIR ORDEAL EXPLODES. MILLIONS OF TELEVISION VIEWERS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES LISTENED IN HORROR TO THE TAPE OF A DESPERATE CALL FOR HELP. WE WERE HAMPERED GREATLY BY THE FACT THAT THE VICTIMS WEREN'T FROM THE AREA, COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THEY WERE BOTH GRAVELY WOUNDED. THAT TAPE WAS ALL OVER THE AIRWAVES. OKAY, SIR. CAN YOU SEE OUT THE WINDOWS? CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE, PLEASE? NO. THIS IS AT A TIME WHEN, YOU KNOW, THE TV WAS BEGINNING TO DO "IF IT BLEEDS, IT LEADS." A COUPLE FROM THE SUBURBS, AMBUSHED IN THEIR CAR AND SHOT BY A BLACK ASSAILANT. IT WAS ON EVERY CHANNEL. IT WAS THE FRONT-PAGE HEADLINE OF EVERY NEWSPAPER. THE CITY WAS OUTRAGED AND PART OF THAT OUTRAGE WAS FUELED BY THE PHOTOGRAPH ON THE FRONT OF THE BOSTON HERALD THAT MORNING, WHICH WAS CLOSE TO OBSCENE. SHOCKING AS THE ASSAULT IS, IT HITS A RAW NERVE. BOSTON IS A HOTBED OF RACIAL TENSION. WHITE VICTIMS, ATTACKED BY A BLACK GUNMAN. BOSTON WAS ANGRY AND TERRIFIED BY THE REPORT. IT FUELED ALL THE FEARS THAT WHITE AMERICANS HAVE ABOUT BLACK AMERICANS. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GO INTO ROXBURY, IF YOU GO INTO MISSION HILL, YOU TAKE YOUR LIFE IN YOUR HANDS. THE STUART CASE HAS PUT BOSTON'S NEIGHBORHOODS UNDER SIEGE. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE STUARTS WAS A SIGNAL THAT ANYONE CAN BE A TARGET. IT COULD HAPPEN HERE, AS WE GO TO OUR CAR IN THE PARKING LOT. THE REACTION WAS SIMPLY OUTRAGE: WHY CAN'T THIS RESPECTABLE COUPLE FROM THE WHITE SUBURBS COME INTO TOWN WITHOUT BEIN' ASSAULTED AND KILLED? IN THE '80s, RACIAL TENSIN, UNEMPLOYMENT, WHITE FLIGHT, AND URBAN DECAY ARE TAKING THEIR TOLL ON CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN BOSTON? IT FEELS PERSONAL. THE WHOLE CITY IS HANGING ON WORD OF WHETHER THE STUARTS WILL SURVIVE. THEY TOOK THE BABY BY CESAREAN SURGERY THAT NIGHT AND THE BABY WAS IN CRITICAL CONDITION. BUT CAROL CAN'T BE SAVED. I PICKED UP THE PHONE AND I HEARD, "CAROL'S DEAD" AND I SAID, "WHAT?" THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL, WHO WOULDN'T HURT A FLY, WAS LIKE STRUCK DOWN IN HER PRIME. IT WAS JUST DEVASTATING. IT WAS LIKE LOSING YOUR OWN KID. CAROL WAS A LOVING, CARING PERSON WHO ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THE OTHER PERSON FIRST. IT WAS HARD TO IMAGINE MORE SYMPATHETIC VICTIMS. THIS IS A KIND OF SITUATION IN WHICH POLICE FEEL MAXIMUM PRESSURE TO "SOLVE THE CRIME." WHAT WAS DECLARED: ANYTHING AND ANYTHING THAT HAD TO BE DONE, WOULD BE DONE. DETECTIVE MILLER THOMAS IS A VETERAN WITH 11 YEARS ON THE FORCE. THE WHOLE HOMICIDE UNIT WAS ALL BROUGHT IN. IT WAS LIKE ONE OF THOSE, YOU KNOW ALL-HANDS-ON-DECK KIND OF THINGS. THOMAS STARTS BY INTERVIEWING CHARLES STUART. I MET HIM IN THE HOSPITAL AND WAS LIKE, "TELL US WHAT HAPPENED! TELL US WHAT HAPPENED!" THEY HAD LEFT THE BRIGHAM WOMEN'S HOSPITAL. THEY CAME UP TO WHAT'S CALLED BRIGHAM'S CIRCLE. HE SAYS, WHILE HE WAS SITTING AT THE LIGHT, THAT A BLACK MALE - Man: YEAH, BOSTON. JUMPED IN THE BACKSEAT OF HIS CAR. - GIMME THAT! DON'T MOVE! - THE ASSAILANT "DON'T LOOK IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR." HE DEMANDS CAROL'S ENGAGEMENT RING AND HER BAG. WHEN HE SEES A CELLPHONE, HE THINKS THE STUARTS ARE COPS AND HE PANICS. THE ROBBER FIRED A SHOT, FIRST, AT CAROL, STRIKING HER IN THE HEAD. AND THEN, AT CHARLES, STRIKING HIM IN THE LOWER BACK. WITH THE JEWELRY AND THE CASH IN HAND, THE ATTACKER DISAPPEARS. CHARLES'S STORY REVEALS FEW NEW DETAILS. YOU'RE LED BY WHERE THE EVIDENCE IS TAKING YOU. JUST STARTING OUT, SORT OF LIKE "THIS IS GONNA BE A DIFFICULT ONE." JUST HOURS AFTER CAROL'S DEATH, HER AUTOPSY REPORT IS COMPLETED. IT CONFIRMS WHAT THOMAS ALREADY KNOWS: THAT SHE WAS KILLED BY A SHOT TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD, FIRED AT CLOSE RANGE. A WOMAN WITH HER HEAD BLOWN OFF LIKE THAT, IT WAS BRUTAL. BULLETS RETRIEVED FROM THE VICTIMS WERE FIRED FROM A.38 SMITH & WESSON. THAT'S THE ONLY SOLID EVIDENCE POLICE HAVE. CLUES, SUCH AS FIBERS AND HAIR SAMPLES, FROM THE CRIME SCENE WERE COMPROMISED BY THE DESPERATE RESCUE EFFORT. THOSE THAT WERE FOUND BELONG TO CHARLES AND CAROL. POLICE HAD NOTHING. THEY DIDN'T HAVE A GUN. THEY DIDN'T HAVE FINGERPRINTS. THEY DIDN'T HAVE DNA, AT THE TIME. THEIR ONLY LEAD IS CHARLES'S DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSAILANT. YEAH, BOSTON. HE SAYS, "A BLACK MAN DID IT." IT WAS A BLACK MAN WITH A RASPY VOICE. WITH A NUBIAN NOSE, WEARIN' A BLACK SWEATSUIT WITH RED STRIPES. BOSTON PD FAN OUT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE CRIME WENT DOWN. MISSION HILL, AT THE TIME, WAS DRUG-RIDDLED. IT WAS PREDOMINANTLY HISPANIC AND BLACK. THE PRESSURE IS ON POLICE TO DELIVER A SUSPECT. NATIONAL ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON MISSION HILL, WHERE THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR CLUES, THE GUN, ANYTHING, TO CRACK THE CASE. TODAY, YOU WOULD FIND SOMETHING 'CAUSE THERE'S CAMERAS EVERYPLACE. BUT THEN, NOTHING. THEY WERE TALKING TO THE PEOPLE, SAYING, "DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING?", BUT WE HAD NO PEOPLE WHO CAME FORWARD AND SAYS, "I SEEN THE GUY DO THIS" OR "I SEEN THIS HAPPEN." THERE WAS NONE OF THAT. SO POLICE EXPAND THEIR SEARCH TO OTHER BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS. IN ROXBURY, BLACK MEN, BY THE HUNDREDS, ARE BEING ROUNDED UP FOR QUESTIONING BY LEGIONS OF POLICE. I MEAN, THEY JUST STARTED GOIN' CRAZY, LOOKIN' FOR PEOPLE. EVERY BLACK MALE IN BOSTON WAS A SUSPECT. FAMILY MEMBERS, POLICE OFFICIALS, AND THE MAYOR ARE ALL ATTENDING CAROL STUART'S FUNERAL SERVICE TODAY. THE FUNERAL WAS STANDING-ROOM-ONLY. CAROL'S PARENTS BRAVELY SOLDIER THROUGH. AND CHARLES STUART'S BROTHERS, MICHAEL AND THE EVER-FAITHFUL MATTHEW, CARRY HER CASKET. THAT'S WHEN THE SADNESS REALLY STARTED TO TAKE ROOT, THIS PROFOUND LOSS OF THIS BEAUTIFUL, LOVING YOUNG WOMAN. THE EULOGY CHARLES WRITES FOR CAROL FROM HIS HOSPITAL BED IS READ BY A CHILDHOOD FRIEND. "GOOD NIGHT SWEET WIFE, MY LOVE. GOD HAS CALLED YOU TO HIS HANDS." IT EXPRESSED THE LOVE THAT WE KNEW THAT CHUCK HAD FOR CAROL AND THE LOVE THAT CAROL HAD FOR CHUCK. "BUT I WILL ALWAYS FEEL YOU. I MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU. YOUR HUSBAND, CHUCK." THERE WASN'T A DRY EYE IN THE WHOLE CHURCH. THE FUNERAL GRIPS BOSTON. FOR POLICE, THE PRESSURE TO FIND THE KILLER ONLY GROWS. BUT SOON, A TIP FROM AN UNLIKELY SOURCE WILL BREAK THIS CASE WIDE OPEN. YEAH, BOSTON. THE VIOLENT ROBBERY OF THE STUARTS AND THE MURDER OF PREGNANT CAROL STUART SHOCKS THE PUBLIC AND PUTS STAGGERING PRESSURE ON BOSTON POLICE TO CAPTURE THE KILLER. THERE WAS A LOT OF FEAR IN THE AFTERMATH THAT, SOMEWHERE, THERE WAS THIS GUY WHO HAD NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE AND HE WAS STALKING PEOPLE, ROBBING AND KILLING. ANXIOUS TO FIND THE PERPETRATOR, POLICE USE A TACTIC SURE TO PRODUCE RESULTS. STOP AND FRISK WAS A RESPONSE TO THE STREET-CORNER DRUG DEALERS, THE PEOPLE OUT ON THE STREETS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN ACTS OF VIOLENCE THAT MADE PEOPLE FEEL VERY UNSAFE. IN THE SUMMER OF 1989, BOSTON PD IMPLEMENTED STOP AND FRISK TO CURB A SURGE IN GANG- AND DRUG-RELATED SHOOTINGS. NOW, THEY'LL USE IT TO CRACK THE STUART CASE. POLICE CAN STOP ANY PERSON THEY SUSPECT, SEARCH HIM, HIS CAR, HIS HOME. IT'S A POWERFUL STRATEGY. IT'S ALSO CONTROVERSIAL. IT'S JUST BEEN A LOT OF POLICE, YOU KNOW, HARASSIN' A LOT OF PEOPLE, THINKIN' THAT WE'RE THE BAD GUYS. THE STUART CASE TOOK IT UP ANOTHER NOTCH. POLICE WENT ON A RAMPAGE WITH THE BLESSINGS OF THE MAYOR AND THE POLICE CHIEF AND THE CITY. PULLIN' THEIR PANTS DOWN, JUST CHECKIN' THEM, BY THE NUMBERS, LIKE 10 AT A TIME. IN THE FIRST 5 DAYS AFTER THE MURDER, 150 STOP-AND-FRISK SEARCHES ARE MADE IN MISSION HILL EACH DAY. THEY WERE GRASPING AT STRAWS BECAUSE THE PRESSURE. THE COPS, I THINK, LEAPT AT ANYTHING. THEY WERE WORKIN' DAY AND NIGHT, TRYIN' TO SOLVE THIS THING. EVERY DAY THAT IT WENT ON, "STILL, NO ARRESTS?! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU GUYS?" AND, IN OUR TOP STORY, CHARLES STUART IS STILL IN CRITICAL CONDITION WHILE HIS NEWBORN SON IS CLINGING TO LIFE. THEY WANTED TO KEEP THE BABY ALIVE UNTIL HE WAS OUT OF THE WOODS, MEDICALLY. THE BABY, CHRISTOPHER, WAS BORN BRAIN-DEAD. BUT AFTER 17 DAYS, IT'S CLEAR HE WILL NEVER RECOVER. CHARLES DECIDES TO TAKE THE BABY OFF LIFE SUPPORT. AND, ON NOVEMBER 9th, CHRISTOPHER DIES WITH CHARLES AT HIS SIDE. TO HEAR THAT THAT LITTLE GUY DIDN'T MAKE IT WAS AS CRUSHING AS HIS MOTHER'S DEATH. THAT'S ETCHED IN YOUR BRAIN AND IT NEVER GOES AWAY. THE CAUSE OF DEATH IS RULED A HOMICIDE. FOR BOSTON, THE NEWS JUST FUELS THE FIRE TO FIND THE KILLER. "DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. FIND WHO DID THIS." ALMOST 3 WEEKS AFTER CAROL'S MURDER, POLICE STILL HAVE NO REAL SUSPECTS, ONLY THOUSANDS OF LEADS FROM PEOPLE CALLING IN THEIR SUSPICIONS. - YEAH. - He was about 6 feet, - OKAY. - wearin' an all-black runnin' suit, white sneakers. DARK SKIN, LIGHT SKIN? PEOPLE WOULD SAY, "I KNOW WHO DID IT" AND "THIS GUY DID IT" AND "THAT GUY DID IT." THE HOTLINE FOR TIPS IS JAMMED WITH SUPPOSED WITNESSES. - He's wearin' a black hat. - YEAH. He has a mustache, was wearin' a striped shirt. CALLERS SAY THAT THEY SAW THE SHOOTING. I just parked my car. HEY, MURPH. - He was at the car window. THAT THEY FOUND CAROL'S JEWELRY. Flat ruby ring. THEY EVEN CLAIM TO KNOW WHERE THE SUSPECT LIVES. 2 Tobin Court, 3rd floor. BUT AMID THE FLOOD OF FALSE LEADS, ONE SEEMS SOLID. A GROUP OF TEENS IN MISSION HILL IS PLAYIN' A GAME CALLED DOUBLE DRIBBLE. BETTER PASS THAT BALL. ONE HAS GOT A STORY TO SHARE. A TEENAGER WAS BRAGGING THAT HIS UNCLE WAS INVOLVED IN THIS CRIME. JOEY BENNETT SAYS HIS UNCLE WILLIE HAD SHOWN HIM A GUN AND "HOW HE SHOT THE LADY." "MY UNCLE COULD'VE DONE THAT. YOU KNOW, HE'S MEAN ENOUGH TO DO THAT." REALLY?! IT WAS ALL STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THROUGH HIS NEPHEW, SO NOW YOU'VE GOT THIS SUSPECT. UNCLE WILLIE BENNETT IS WELL-KNOWN AROUND MISSION HILL. EVEN HIS NEPHEW WAS PROUD OF THE FACT THAT HIS UNCLE WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BADDEST DUDES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. BENNETT HAS A VIOLENT REPUTATION. NOBODY MESSED WITH HIM. HE HAD A LONG RECORD. THE EVIDENCE IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL, BUT IT'S ENOUGH FOR INVESTIGATORS TO BRING IN HIS NEPHEW FOR QUESTIONING. IT FIT EVERYTHING THE POLICE NEEDED: SOMEONE WHO SAW HIM WITH THE GUN. JOEY AGREES TO SIGN AN AFFIDAVIT. HIS OWN NEPHEW, SAYIN' HE DID IT. WHAT MORE DID YOU NEED? WILLIE BENNETT WAS NOW THE SUSPECT. POLICE! LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO! POLICE MAKE THEIR MOVE. MOVE, MOVE, MOVE! AND THEY'RE NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES. POLICE! - IT WAS ABOUT 50 COPS. THEY WENT TO FIVE DIFFERENT HOUSES AT THE SAME TIME. HE WAS AT ONE OF THOSE HOUSES. IT WAS SO TERRIFYING. BOSTON POLICE ARE CLOSIN' IN ON MURDER SUSPECT WILLIE BENNETT. LET'S GO! THEY DIDN'T KNOCK. THEY KICKED THE DOOR IN. - POLICE! - POLICE! - HELICOPTERS. - FREEZE! FREEZE! - PEOPLE ON THE ROOF. - DOWN! GET DOWN! ON THE GROUND! GET DOWN! GET DOWN! IT WAS SCARY. IT WAS NERVE-RACKING. BENNETT IS TAKEN AWAY, ARRESTED ON UNRELATED CHARGES, FOR NOW. AND INVESTIGATORS DESCEND ON HIS HIDEOUT IN SEARCH OF CLUES. THEY WERE LOOKIN' FOR CAROL'S BELONGINGS. THE POLICE BROKE IT APART, TURNED EVERYTHING OVER. THEY BROKE HOLES IN THE WALLS, DESTROYED EVERYTHING. THEY COME UP EMPTYHANDED. HE DIDN'T HAVE THE SWEATSUIT. HE HAD NO JEWELRY OR MONEY TAKEN FROM THE VICTIMS. WE HAD NO HARD PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. THERE WAS NOTHING DIRECTLY TYING HIM INTO IT, NOTHING LIKE CLOTHING, A GUN. WHAT WE HAD WAS A LOT OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL STUFF. IN CUSTODY, BENNETT INSISTS HE'S INNOCENT. BUT THERE IS ONE EYEWITNESS WHO MAY BE ABLE TO PROVE BENNETT DID IT: CHARLES STUART. 6 WEEKS AFTER THE MURDER, DETECTIVE MILLER THOMAS PUTS TOGETHER A PHOTO LINEUP OF EIGHT BLACK MALE SUSPECTS, HAND-DELIVERED TO CHARLES'S BEDSIDE. WE PUT A GROUP OF BLACK POLICEMEN THAT I KNEW WHO LOOKED AS CLOSE TO WILLIE BENNETT AS POSSIBLE. TAKE YOUR TIME, NOW. CHARLES STUDIES EACH PICTURE, CAREFULLY. AND HE DOESN'T HESITATE. THAT'S HIM. CHARLES STUART POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED WILLIE BENNETT AND NOTHING ANYONE SAID WAS GONNA CHANGE THAT. POLICE FINALLY HAVE THE EVIDENCE TO MAKE THEIR CASE. BECAUSE NOW THEY HAD SOMEONE WHO HAD A HISTORY, HAD A REPUTATION OF BEIN' A TOUGH GUY. THEY HAD CHARLES STUART'S EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION OF BENNETT. AND THEY HAD THE AFFIDAVIT OF A WITNESS BENNETT CONFESSED TO. IT LOOKS LIKE THE POLICE HAVE DONE IT. THEIR PRIMARY SUSPECT IN THE SHOOTING OF THE SO-CALLED CAMELOT COUPLE IS AN EX-CON WHO'S AGE 39, ONE WILLIE BENNETT. WHEN I HEARD THAT THERE WAS ARREST, WHEN I HEARD THAT THEY HAD SOMEONE, THERE WAS A SENSE OF MAYBE WE WOULD GET SOME CLOSURE. THE BOSTON PAPERS REPORT CHARLES AND HIS BROTHER MATTHEW ARE "ENCOURAGED". IT'S A BIG DAY FOR THE PRESS. AFTER HE IDENTIFIED WILLIE BENNETT, THE BOSTON HERALD AND THE GLOBE BOTH CALLED FOR A REINSTATEMENT OF THE DEATH PENALTY. THE DiMAITIS' REACTION IS RESTRAINED. THEY REMAIN IN SECLUSION. CAROL'S PARENTS WERE SO DEVASTATED. I DON'T KNOW HOW CAROL'S PARENTS SURVIVED WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH. AS FOR BENNETT'S FAMILY, THEY ARE DEVASTATED. WE WERE NEVER GONNA SEE OUR BROTHER AGAIN. THEY WAS GONNA PUT MY BROTHER IN THAT ELECTRIC CHAIR. NOW, IT'S ALL UP TO A GRAND JURY TO CHARGE BENNETT WITH MURDER. THEY WERE ABOUT TO INDICT HIM IN DECEMBER OF 1989. THERE WAS A SENSE OF ANTICIPATION, THAT MAYBE JUSTICE WOULD BE DONE. FOR BOTH THE DiMAITI AND THE STUART FAMILIES, IT LOOKS LIKE THERE MAY FINALLY BE SOME PEACE. FOR ALL, EXCEPT CHARLES'S YOUNGER BROTHER, MATTHEW. HE'S GOT A SECRET TO SHARE, ONE THAT'S GOING TO SHOCK THE CITY OF BOSTON. CHARLES STUART IS RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL. HE'S WEAK, BUT GRATEFUL TO BE ALIVE. A MONTH LATER, HIS BROTHER MATTHEW IS LOOKING TO BE RELEASED AS WELL, FROM A SECRET THAT'S BURDENING HIM. THE PHENOMENAL, PROFOUND CONFUSION THAT HE MUST FEEL AT THIS MOMENT CAN'T BE UNDERESTIMATED. MATTHEW WAS FAR LESS SUCCESSFUL THAN CHARLES AND HAD ALWAYS LOOKED UP TO HIM. MATTHEW STUART WAS ADRIFT, WAS SORT OF THE RUNT OF THE LITTER, JOBLESS, FUTURELESS, SOMEONE WHO, WHEN HIS BROTHER SAID, "DO THIS FOR ME," HE WOULD. BUT THE LAST TIME CHARLES ASKED MATTHEW TO HELP HIM, HE WENT TOO FAR. MATTHEW'S GOT PROOF: AN ENGAGEMENT RING. CAROL STUART'S. MATTHEW STUART. HAVE A SEAT HERE. SO THAT WAS WHEN HE DECIDED TO GET A LAWYER AND TALK TO THE POLICE. FOUR MONTHS AGO, MY BROTHER CAME TO ME. MATTHEW TELLS INVESTIGATORS THAT, 4 MONTHS AGO, CHARLES TOLD HIM HE NEEDED MONEY. HE WANTED $100,000 TO GO, YOU KNOW, INVEST IN A RESTAURANT WITH HIS FRIEND. NOW THAT CAROL WAS PREGNANT, THERE JUST WASN'T GOING TO BE ENOUGH CASH TO START HIS BUSINESS. BUT CHARLES HAD A PLAN. IT WAS GONNA BE AN INSURANCE FRAUD, ESSENTIALLY: CHARLES WOULD TAKE CAROL'S JEWELRY AND THEN WOULD CLAIM THAT HE HAD BEEN ROBBED ON THE STREETS OF BOSTON BY SOMEONE WHILE HE WAS IN HIS CAR. CHARLES WOULD THEN GIVE MATTHEW A PACKAGE THAT CONTAINED THE STUFF THAT HAD BEEN ROBBED. MATTHEW'S JOB WAS TO GET RID OF THE STOLEN GOODS. AS PLANNED, CHARLES DRIVES TO A DESOLATE SPOT AND PARKS. BUT HE ISN'T ALONE. AND IT TURNS OUT THERE'S MORE TO HIS PLAN. CHARLES STUART IS NOT JUST SCHEMING TO END HIS MONEY TROUBLES. HE WANTS TO END HIS MARRIAGE, TOO, WITH THE ULTIMATE BETRAYAL. TO THINK ABOUT WHAT CAROL'S LAST MOMENTS WERE LIKE, I MEAN, WHAT, YOU KNOW, JUST WONDERING WHAT THE HELL WENT THROUGH HER MIND WHEN SHE REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING. CHARLES PULLS THE RINGS OFF CAROL'S FINGERS, PUTS THEM IN A HANDBAG, AND SHOOTS HIMSELF. HE PUTS THE GUN IN THE BAG, THE BAG FOR MATTHEW. MATTHEW HAD NO IDEA THAT CAROL WAS IN THE CAR. IN FACT, ON THE EVENING IN QUESTION, HE DIDN'T EVEN SEE HER. MATTHEW WAS SHOCKED WHEN HE OPENED UP THE PACKAGE... ...AND SAW THERE WAS A GUN IN IT. WHEN HE HEARD ON THE TV NEWS THAT CHARLES WAS CLAIMING THAT AN INTRUDER CAME IN AND SHOT CAROL, HE KNEW HIS BROTHER HAD DONE IT. CHARLES NEVER TOLD MATTHEW THIS WOULD BE A MURDER. MATTHEW GETS RID OF THE GUN AND THE JEWELRY, AS INSTRUCTED, BUT HOLDS ON TO THE LAST PHYSICAL PROOF OF A CRIME HE IS NOW A PARTNER IN. AND IT EATS AWAY AT HIM OVER THE NEXT 3 OR 4 MONTHS. WHEN IT APPEARS WILLIE BENNETT WILL FACE THE DEATH PENALTY, MATTHEW DECIDES TO BREAK HIS SILENCE. HE FINALLY HAD TO COME FORWARD TO TELL THE TRUTH. NOW, CHARLES STUART IS A WANTED MAN. YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, THERE WAS A DRAMATIC TURN OF EVENTS THAT RELATES TO THIS PARTICULAR MATTER, WHICH, UM, FOCUSED ON MR. CHARLES STUART AS A SUSPECT. CHARLES KNOWS POLICE ARE OUT TO ARREST HIM. THEY'VE LAUNCHED A DESPERATE, CITYWIDE SEARCH AFTER THEY FIND HIS HOME EMPTY. SORRY, CAN'T COME TO THE PHONE RIGHT NOW, BUT IF YOU LEAVE YOUR NAME AND NUMBER, I'LL GET BACK TO YA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. CHUCK, THIS IS BILLY. GIVE ME A CALL. YOU KNOW THE NUMBER. CHUCKY, IT'S MAY. CALL ME AT HOME. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS AND I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU. HI, THIS IS NANCY CRANE OF WEEI RADIO AND WE'RE TRYING TO TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT REPORTS THAT CHARLES STUART JUMPED OFF THE TOBIN BRIDGE AND WOULD APPRECIATE A CALL. 7:00 A. M. STUART'S CAR IS FOUND ABANDONED ON THE LOWER DECK OF THE TOBIN BRIDGE. FOUR HOURS LATER, A BODY IS RECOVERED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE MYSTIC RIVER. CHARLES STUART'S. FAIR TO SAY THAT HE COULD NOT ACCEPT, OR HE COULD NOT HANDLE, THE ALLEGATIONS, OR THE STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT HIM. THE STUART CASE QUICKLY UNRAVELS, LEAVING IN ITS WAKE OUTRAGE. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D KILL YOUR OWN WIFE. AND A LONG TRAIL OF VICTIMS. THE WHOLE DEMONIZING OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AND THEN BECOMING SUPERPREDATORS CAME OUT OF THIS WHOLE TIME, THIS LATE '80s, EARLY '90s. CHARLES STUART SHOWED US HOW EASY IT WAS TO MANIPULATE THAT. I SEE MY BROTHER EVERY DAY. WHEN I LOOK AT HIM, I HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THAT WE WERE PUT THROUGH, FOR NOTHING. THE CITY OF BOSTON APOLOGIZES TO WILLIE BENNETT. BUT, FOR MANY, IT'S TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. IT CREATED THAT FEELING THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT 99.9% OF THE MURDERS, EXCEPT FOR THE ONE WHERE WE HAD TWO WHITE VICTIMS. TODAY, STOP AND FRISK IS STILL CONTROVERSIAL ACROSS THE NATION AND BOSTON PD STILL STANDS ACCUSED OF RACIAL PROFILING. THE DISTRUST THAT WAS FOSTERED BETWEEN THE BOSTON POLICE AND SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES STILL MAY PREVAIL TODAY. MATTHEW STUART SERVES 2.5 YEARS FOR INSURANCE FRAUD, BUT THE CRIME DESTROYS HIM. HE DIED IN A HOMELESS SHELTER, OF AN OVERDOSE OF DRUGS. OF ALL CHARLES STUART'S VICTIMS, PERHAPS THE MOST UNFORGIVABLE WAS THE FIRST. THOSE OF US WHO KNEW CAROL, WE WONDERED, "HOW COULD WE BE SO STUPID? WHAT DID WE MISS?" CHARLES STUART IS BURIED IN AN UNMARKED GRAVE, A FITTING END TO A MAN WHO ALMOST GOT AWAY WITH MURDER.
