 Look around. The war's already started. The Fun Hai tried to dice my dad. Why would they attack us? They made a deal with the Long Zii. They need to pay tonight! A debt's a debt. I'm just a messenger. White man working for the chinks? I thought you had some Irish pride. Sun Yang threatened to kill me. My sister offered to marry him.

 She gave up her life to save me. Why are you even here, Lee? Why does a Southern boy have to come all the way out here to become a cop? Father Jun, thank you for receiving me. Stay on your feet for two rounds, and I'll let you walk out of here a new man. Leary, stop! You're gonna kill him! No, Bill. You're gonna kill him. What did he say? It doesn't matter what he said.

 They're going to kill me. 30 years I was one of the most respected men in Chinatown. Now I'm hiding out like some low-level onion. It's just temporary. There was a time I could walk down the street and not once fear a hatchet in my back because the street feared me. Now... there's no dignity in this. This will pass. Things will change. You'll see. Come on. Let's get you into bed. I guess we'll stay here a little while until we figure out a way forward. You're safe here. I'm not safe anywhere. As usual, Ah Toy, you have an eye for quality. This one's special. Raised from birth to be a concubine for the warlord Dong Zhuo. Bred for fucking. Buy her, and you can make up whatever bullshit story you want. My girls sell themselves. This one does have potential, though. The men get lonely on the salt. I need to keep them happy. You need to keep me happy. And I'm not. Wait. - How old is she? - I don't know. 17, 18. Father sold her to me to settle a debt. She doesn't talk much, but, uh, it's not a problem for most customers. Even better, she's never been touched. You know how rare it is... Pretty one like this and still a virgin? She's double the price, of course, but I imagine you could charge five times that. Where is she from? Some dried-up fishing village in Shandong Province. Yu... Yumi-something? Yumingzui? You know it? Well, if you want her... better decide fast. This one's already sold. Daddy, are you okay? Hmm? What's that? You've hardly said a word to me all evening. Haven't I? I'm sorry, dear. I guess I am a little distracted. Can I help? It's nothing to concern yourself with. Just some minor business issues. The cable car commission? Talk to me, Daddy. Blake promised me that contract. He swore it was mine. And I staked my entire business on his word. I took positions. If it doesn't come through soon, I will be forced to declare bankruptcy. I could lose the house. Your mother's house. I thought it was in process. That's just another way of saying it hasn't happened. I can talk to him. I don't think talk is what he's after. Excuse me? I married the man. What else would you have me do? This isn't easy for me, either. How do you think it feels to ask you to... To be a whore. He's your husband. And I'm your daughter. Shame on you, Daddy. Good? Good. Oh, before I forget... For your headaches. The herbalist said two pinches into a glass of water. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. Hello, Ah Toy. And this is? Not on the menu. Hey, you know I like them experienced. How else am I gonna learn? It's okay. You had a long, hard journey. I know. But you're safe here with me. I promise. A warm bath... Good rest. Soon you may remember how to smile. Come on. Anything else I can get you? Bill. Aye? Oh. No, no. I'm done. Here. You got a problem, friend? No. No problem... friend. You been sitting there staring at me all night. You got something you want to say to me, say it. Can I buy you a drink, Sergeant O'Hara? I'm drunk enough. An Irishman turning down free libations? Shit. I don't know if that's a world I want to live in. Well, maybe you should get to the fucking point. You know, an Irishman I once knew, he told me... "In Ireland, we only drink "on days starting with a T. "That'd be Tuesday, 'Tursday, ' today, tomorrow, 'Taturday, ' and 'Tunday.'" You been waiting there all night just to tell me a bad fucking joke? This here ain't no joke. - What the hell is this? - Your boy Lee. Murdered two men in Georgia. Bullshit. Shot one, cut the other's throat. His own kin too. Then he just disappeared. He's a smart kid. Got out pretty clean. But there's always a trail, isn't there? And I followed it... clear across the country... 'cause that's what I do. Now, I have to admit, I did not expect to find him wearing a badge. That complicates things a little. Now, I have the utmost respect for law enforcement, Sergeant... but murder's murder... and a bounty's a bounty. So what I need here... what I'm respectfully requesting from you, Sergeant... Is just some cooperation. And for that... I am willing to split said bounty. From what I hear, you could use it. - $500? - Keep it down. We don't want anyone else getting ambitious. Mm. 50/50. Less my expenses, of course. You know what? I think I will have that drink. Ah Sahm. My brother. The extra chop is from Yat Sen to make up for last week's shortfall. Nice. You're getting the hang of it. Let's get you a drink and some sticky. Actually, I have to get going. I'm meeting someone. You already got a girl somewhere. Nah, I'll leave the girls to you. Me, I like a woman. You can have them. Those bitches bite. Seriously, though, I'm glad you're getting some sticky before the blood jam begins. What are you talking about? Another. Is something going on? I'm not supposed to talk about it. Young Jun. Those motherfuckers tried to kill my father in broad daylight. We can't let that go unanswered. We're moving on Long Zii. Father Jun found out the old man's holed up in some digs outside Chinatown. Bolo's already on his way to dice him and his bitch wife. And tomorrow, well, let's just say, um, things are gonna get interesting. If we know where they are, why aren't we all going? Walls have ears, man. Father Jun didn't want to risk anyone tipping off the Long Zii. Bolo will be in and out of there before they know what the fuck hit them. Ah Toy. What are you doing? You can't just barge in here. Long Zii has a house outside of Chinatown. I need to know where. What? Mai Ling... They're gonna kill her. I heard something about a house, but I don't know where it is. Well, who does? - I can't get involved in this. - Ah Toy... - And neither should you. - She's my sister. She was your sister. In China. Here, she's your enemy. She's already tried to kill Father Jun once. Do you think she'd spare you a second thought if the opportunity arose again? I can't let her die. You can't stop what's happening. You told me I would need someone to trust. Someone outside the tong. I need that person. Now. What the fuck? Get out. Fuck! This is Zhang Yang. She once worked as a maid for Long Zii. Long Zii has a house outside of Chinatown. Do you know it? Look at me. Do you know it? - What is it? - I don't know. What are you doing? Stay here. What happened? Hey, Mai Ling. Fuck you. Bitch! Huh? You little cunt. Yeah. Shh. That's it. Shh. There you go. Go to sleep. Xiaojing. What the fuck are you doing? Leave her. If you want to dice Long Zii, I won't stop you. You're damn right you're not gonna stop me. Father Jun gave the order for the both of them. - No. - "No"? What the hell do you mean, "no"? What's wrong with you? Get the fuck out of my way. If you want her, you're gonna have to go through me. Is that right? You know... I always knew there was something off about you. Yeah, you did. I don't know what your deal is... but that won't make this any less fun. That's enough. Xiaojing... You need to get out of here. Go. Just go. Mai Ling. Are you hurt? I'm fine. It's over. Rest now. So... they've managed to kill me after all. I'm glad it's you. Close your eyes. They have no idea who they're dealing with, do they? They will. - Good choice. - I hope so. - Enjoy yourself, Councilman. - I will. Good to see you. Good to see you as well. That one. Ah Toy, this Mr. Holbrook. Welcome. - What did you say? - He say you an important man. Well... I don't know about that. Please, enjoy. - I'm sorry, what? - He say you want to fuck virgin. Well, a bit crude, yes, but, um... I do fancy the untouched ones. Mr. Zan here said you might be able to accommodate me. If it's a question of price... I meant no offense, miss. Bill. What are you doing here? Something you forget to tell me? Well, I guess it makes sense there'd be posters. Doesn't quite capture me, but... close enough for government work. Where'd you get it? You are not the one gonna be asking the questions right now. I trusted you with my life, with my family's lives. It's not what you think. No? Then why don't you tell me what it is, then? After the war... this family of freed slaves came to live with us. They came to help manage the farm. I pretty much grew up with them. And, uh, well, their daughter Nora, well... from a young age, we were kind of like brother and sister. Until we... weren't, if you get my meaning. We kept it quiet. We'd meet in secret, usually in the barn. But we knew if we ever wanted a shot at something real, we'd have to get the hell out of the South. Head west. Buy some land, maybe. Nora... Well, she... she would always leave the barn first... And then I would follow a little while later. This time... this time when she left, I... I-I heard her cry out. I come out to see two of my cousins holding on to her. Real mean sons of bitches. Uh, I guess they were drunk, and they'd been onto us for a while, and they... They had this sickle. She fought, my girl. They killed her right in front of me. I watched her die. So you killed them. Well, I shot one of them right there. But I only had one shell in the rifle, so I... I got ahold of that sickle and I went after the other one. Kept going for a while after he died. Then I buried Nora and I left town that night. My folks had been through enough. Why here? Why San Francisco? I guess if San Francisco didn't end at the ocean, I'd have kept going. Becoming a cop? I suppose you think that's some sort of penance. Penance? What for? Those bastards deserved what they got. They killed my girl. That's a hell of a story. And, hell, it might even be true. But it don't change things. A bounty's a bounty, and the law's the law. Look, I got a whole speech about the easy way and the hard way. Do you want to hear it? You bastard. Don't be a fucking idiot. I get paid the same dead or alive, but it's a hell of a long ride to be carrying a stiff. Put the knife down, boy. This ain't gonna end the way you think it is. He's right, you know. Okay. That's enough. I need him ambulatory. You are no longer welcome in San Francisco. You've got the rest of the country to ply your trade, but if you come back here, we'll finish the job. Clean him up and put him on a train. You could have at least tipped me off. Where's the fun in that? The truth is, I didn't know what I was gonna do. I had to hear it from you. You didn't strike me as a cold-blooded killer, but you never know. Either way, I was gonna... save your ass or make some money, depending on the outcome. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you. A man shouldn't pay for doing the right thing... even if he might have gone about it the wrong way. Still, you should have told me. Who tells a police officer they're wanted for murder? Yeah, you've got a point there. You got any more secrets, Goober? Uh, no. Just the one. You do realize he won't be the last at the price they've got on you? I do. Sergeant. Thank you. I owed you one. It used to be called Spring Valley, but the locals refer to the area as Cow Hollow now. Owner leases it to about a half a dozen dairy farmers. It's good grazing, fresh water springs. I mean, pays for itself. Why he sell land so valuable? Well, the owner made a fortune in the Comstock haul ten years back and then reinvested the profits into real estate. Took a bath in last year's crash. That's why they call it "speculation." The word is, he's desperate to unload quickly, so, uh, most of the offers are gonna come in low. But if we offer slightly over asking... I think we can snatch it right out from under them. Be a nice addition to your assets. Our asset. Without you... cannot buy this land. Nor I without your funding, Ah Toy. I'm very grateful. Well... to our latest acquisition. To partners. Now, hear me out. He doubled his price. What the hell is this? I paid for this. Zan said he'd explain. You explain face to wife. That's enough. Go to my room. Clean yourself up. I'll be in soon. Get him out of here. You crazy bitch! What? What are you doing? So assuming the surveys check out... we can start excavating next month. Father Jun. What happened? He killed Long Zii. But the bitch survived. I don't doubt Bolo was a true warrior until his last breath. Okay. They want a war? Let's give them one. They're here. I should have been there. No. No, I needed you here. I failed Long Zii. They killed him. No, they didn't. It was time. It's our time. When I was younger, my father told me a story of a fox. He was traveling down a road when he met a tiger. The tiger cornered him, but the fox showed no fear. This confused the tiger, who asked... "Why aren't you afraid? I mean, everyone fears me." And the fox replied, "Well, everyone fears me too." And the tiger laughed, but the fox insisted. "Follow me down the road, "and if the travelers we come across "don't flee in fear, then you can have me for a meal." The tiger was curious... so he followed the fox down the road, and when the travelers caught sight of the fox followed by the tiger... They ran away, frightened. Even as a little girl, I understood that the fox was just borrowing terror from the tiger. My husband, Long Zii, was that tiger... Surrounded by many foxes. All profiting off the fear that he put in people's hearts. And as he grew older... and weaker... Some of these foxes were fooled into thinking that they were actually tigers. Today... we'll remind them who the tiger really is. - You okay? - You kidding? I'm dying to dice these cocksuckers. You look a little jumpy. I've known Bolo since I was a kid. He was a tough motherfucker. Yeah. He was. I swear, I thought he was indestructible. Things are changing, man. You haven't been here long enough to feel it. It's like the ground is shifting under our feet. Long Zii's dead. Father Jun's getting older. - You worried? - Nah, man. I'm ready for it. It's like it's our world now and everyone else is just living in it. Just watch your back out there. You fucking watch it. I'll be too busy slicing and dicing. We have to assume Mai Ling has two armies. We'll put an end to the Long Zii's little insurrection once and for all. We have gangs murdering each other out in the open. I think it's time you took a stand. Tell me, what kind of future do we have? What makes you think I want an end to this war? We have the best fighters in Chinatown. We're gonna take back our city!
