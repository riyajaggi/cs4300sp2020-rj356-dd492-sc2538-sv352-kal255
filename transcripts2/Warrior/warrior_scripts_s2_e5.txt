 You do nothing! You contribute nothing. There's a back entrance to my father's factory. MAI LING: I've had nothing before. And I've sacrificed too much to ever have nothing again. We are warriors.

 [grunts quietly] ♪ ♪ [exhales slowly] ♪ ♪ Did I wake you up? - No. - [exhales deeply] You don't sleep enough. - [scoffs softly] You don't need to worry about me. - You're troubled. I feel it. - I'm not. The peace is holding. Our prospects are good. I know you don't approve of our alliance with the Fung Hai, but it's necessary. - That's not what's keeping you up at night. Ah Sahm... [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - What about him? - You feel guilty for ordering his death. - And you judge me for doing it. - Mai Ling, no. - Because what kind of person would kill her own brother? - That's not what I meant. - Good. ♪ ♪ Because you have no idea what he did to me. ♪ ♪ The things I endured. [sorrowful music] You're right. ♪ ♪ I think about it. Over and over again. I see him... lying there... bloody and beaten, and he's looking up at me. And suddenly, there's no tournament, no tongs... nothing, just... just a boy crying for his sister to help him. I can't undo what's happened. - He is your family. Don't you think he could forgive you? - I wouldn't. I haven't. ♪ ♪ [dramatic spaghetti western music] ♪ ♪ [rubble settling softly] [debris clattering] - Miss? - Jacob. What is that awful smell? - It's opium, miss. - Opium? [indistinct conversation] What is it doing here? - There were boxes of it hidden in the storeroom. There were bodies too. Hop Wei. [indistinct conversation continues] - My source in Chinatown says the Fung Hai are back to business as usual. So tonight's the night, boys. No one leaves after their shifts. Not for a fuck, a drink, or a goddamn prayer at church. If you got business to take care of, you take care of it today, because tonight, we show these heathen bastards what happens when you fuck with San Francisco cops! [cheers and applause] Where the fuck have you been? Lee, you look like a puddle of shit. - Did you tell the men why the Fung Hai attacked you? - And why would I do that? You want to unburden yourself? Be my guest. But we both know it won't make a damn bit of difference. Fuckin' hell, Lee. You were there. They had a knife to my boy's throat. What makes you think they'll stop coming? These animals need to be put down. - Oh, so-- so that's what this is. Revenge. - You're damn right! And after what they did to you, I'd think you'd want a piece as well. - They didn't do this to me, Bill. You did. All of this is because of you. [tense music] - Look, I don't have time for this right now. We are going in there tonight. And if you are anything less than stone fuckin' sober we are gonna have a problem. Am I clear? ♪ ♪ - Is that an order, Sergeant? - Yes, it is a fucking order! ♪ ♪ - Penny. Penny, I... came as soon as I heard. - And I guess that makes sense, considering the amount of opium you had stored here. It's gone, by the way. All of it. - [sighs softly] I'm sorry. I didn't have a choice. - I trusted you. And you used me. The worst part is I actually paid you to do it. I also paid you for protection. So...job well-done there. Your men are dead. Don't worry; Jacob took them away before the police arrived. - [groans softly] Thank you. - Believe me, I didn't do it for you. My fault, really. I knew what you were when I hired you. - Yeah, and what does that say about you? - [stiffly] You need to leave--now. because if you don't, it's very possible I'm going to scream. [breathing heavily] [indistinct chatter] - Chief Flannagan. Please, have a seat. - No need. I won't be long. - It's been a while since we broke bread together. I was starting to feel a little forgotten. - I gather you've heard about Mercer Steel. - It's right here. So a fat city contract goes to Mercer, and now it turns out he's the mayor's father-in-law. [chuckles dryly] And that doesn't strike anyone as rotten? - It struck somebody as something, because they went and blew it up. - I don't know anything about that. [clears throat] And neither do you, or I'd be in cuffs right now, wouldn't I? - This stops now, you hear me? There'll be no more bombings, no more attacks. - Like I said, I don't know anything about it. But if I did, do you really think coming in here and talking at me like some uppity schoolmarm would change a fuckin' thing? - Then I'll talk to you more directly. If this keeps happening, no one on my end will give a shit about due process. They'll be calling for your head, and they'll turn a blind fuckin' eye to what it takes to get it. - Hmm. There's the Irishman. Good for you. So, as long as we're just two Irishmen talking, I'll be equally clear. Your people at City Hall created this mess by starving their own citizens to line the pockets of friends and relatives. Now those citizens are fighting back, as hungry men will. The fact is, it's out of my hands. Things keep going on the way they're going 'round here, this city is gonna burn. And when it does, the blood'll be your hands, not mine. You and the fucking politicians that pay your wages. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [ethereal folk guitar music] ♪ ♪ - Welcome to Sonoma. I'm so glad you decided to come. - [speaking Cantonese] [birds singing] [indistinct Cantonese conversations] - It's beautiful. - It is, isn't it? [speaking Cantonese] - [speaking Cantonese] - The harvest is over, but we're getting ready for next year. There's always work to be done. We have rooms over in the bunkhouse and cows and pigs in the barn. The girls are never bored. - They look happy. - Good morning, Fen Hua. - Morning, Miss Nellie. - I found Fen Hua just over a year ago. She was in a crib brothel on the Barbary Coast under the m-most awful conditions. Her hair was missing some patches, and she'd bitten her fingers right down to bloody stumps. She thought that if she made herself undesirable, then her captors might release her or maybe just... - Kill her. - Most of these girls come from places like that. You know, some of them were kept in cages. Beaten, raped, every day for months. From the moment they set foot on our shores, they've known nothing but suffering. But I want to give them something else. You know, the thing that brought them here to begin with: hope. And that's what America's supposed to be, right? That's why you came. That's why everyone comes. Come on. There's so much more to see. [workers talking indistinctly] - Samuel. What are you doing here? - The damage is extensive. I can't imagine anyone buying you out at this point. - I have no intention of selling. And if you're here to gloat, can you do it later? I'm a little busy right now. - Penny, dear... You must know this rift between us brings me no joy. How long to rebuild? - A month. Six weeks at most. If you're worried about our ability to fill the city's order... - Well, not to put too fine a point on it, but yes, I--I am worried. - As I told you, our contract is legally binding. - Of course. As long as you anticipate no interruption in deliveries, no late shipments. Because the contract is only binding if all parties adhere to the terms. Surely your lawyer must have told you that. On your advice, I sought some legal counsel of my own. - [shakily] We'll deliver. On time. - I don't see how, given the state of things. And while, as your husband I would like nothing more than to help you... as mayor, I'm afraid my hands are tied. - [softly] Samuel, please. [soft, dramatic music] ♪ ♪ I'm begging you. ♪ ♪ - I know it's disappointing. You gave it your best. I'll give you that. But anyone can see this is where the road ends. It'll be good to have you at home again, dear. ♪ ♪ [music darkens] ♪ ♪ - I say we go dice these Mick cunts right now. - There are dozens of them and two of us. It's suicide. - We've got a fucking tong, man! - [clears throat] [other patrons grow silent] - [quietly] Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. [patrons resume indistinct conversations] Father Jun's gonna take our fucking heads-- - He doesn't know anything. He doesn't have to, ever. - You don't know what you're talking about, man. Father Jun may be checked out, but you better believe he watches the fuckin' books. Even if we had the chop to place a late order to China-- which we don't-- we'd never get it in time. We're gonna start missing deliveries in a week. - I'll go see Happy Jack. Get some more stuff to hold us over. - No way he's gonna front you. He made that pretty fucking clear. - Nah. That was before he knew us. We're a good long-term prospect for him. I'll work something out. [western guitar chord] - I'm in. ♪ ♪ - What the fuck is he talking about? - I have no idea. You don't know what the fuck we're talking about. - Well, not the details. I'm too damn fresh for that. - Damn right. - Yes, you are. - Sounds like you started scoring molasses off the books from a local supplier to boost your margins, but your shipment just got fried and now you don't have the chop to replace it. You take more chop, Father Jun will notice and you're fucked. If you don't, you'll miss deliveries, Father Jun will notice, and you're fucked. All roads lead to some kind of major fuckery. - Look, I don't know what kind of fuckin' story you're spinning, here-- - Hey. [chuckling] You're not getting me. I'm not looking to sink your shit. I just wanna help. - Why? - You guys stood up for me. I didn't need you to, but I appreciated it. You're my best American friends. [suspenseful rock music] - Okay. - This onion's batshit crazy. - [chuckles] - Hmm. ♪ ♪ We can work with crazy. [western guitar chords] ♪ ♪ [indistinct conversation] - They eat dinner together? - It creates a sense of family, something these girls desperately need. [women speaking Cantonese] - So many girls. - And it's grown faster than I even dared hope. [exhales] I'm gonna open a second winery soon. - How you pay for all this? - My husband left me a substantial fortune. But the wine we make, that pays for the land and the food. Even after I'm gone, these girls will have a home. Come on. Let's eat. [soft, dissonant music] ♪ ♪ - [breathing shakily] - Ah Toy? What's wrong? - [swallows] [inhales] This place remind me of my grandmother. [sniffles] She had beautiful garden in China. Very peaceful. We grow tomato together. I not think of her in a long time. - Do you know you found my favorite place on the entire property? - [sniffles softly] - Here? - Yeah. Well, this is where the transformation happens. Everything in these barrels starts out as grape juice. It's sweet, but unrefined. Drink too much, it'll give you the trots. - [chuckles] - But, with a little patience and care... it becomes something else. Go on. Try. Go on. - It's good. - Yeah. It'll get you drunk too. - [chuckles] [takes deep breath] - God, you take care of so many people, Ah Toy. But who takes care of you? It must be lonely. [soft, dramatic music] - Sometimes. ♪ ♪ [wood splinters] - I thought you said you couldn't deliver. - I said it would be difficult with all the heat on me, not that I couldn't do it. - Where'd you get them? - I didn't get them. I had them made-- to your exact specifications. Easier to control quality that way. Where do you want the rest of 'em? - Bring them back. [men grunt softly] Your fee. - It's more than we agreed upon. - For your trouble and a down payment on our future endeavors. [apprehensive music] ♪ ♪ - This is, I'm not a bank. I don't hold money I didn't earn. You want to put in another order, that's fine. But my loyalty's not for sale. ♪ ♪ - What if that isn't good enough for me? - All due respect, but tough shit. - [chuckles] I like that. Big talk. Chest puffed up like he's got a pair. [henchmen laugh] Except you're trying too hard, Chao. ♪ ♪ And when a guy like you overplays his hand... a man with a reputation for being unshakable... I wonder if something is... wrong. ♪ ♪ - [grunts] Let's go. Come on. - [coughs] - Let's go. - [coughs] [tense music] ♪ ♪ Hide the bodies. - Yes, sir. [grunts, groans] - So how about it? You got something you want to get off your chest? - Okay. You want the truth? Here's the truth. I don't like you, Zing. I don't like your tong, and I don't like your bullshit threats. And if you can't respect my independence, we got nothing more to talk about. Now... If you want to do business, you know where to find me. [apprehensive music] - Here's the thing, Chao. When we do business, we do it with family. You're Fung Hai, you're Fung Hai, and that's it. We'll kill for you or die for you. ♪ ♪ But if you're not... ♪ ♪ - [grunts] - That's a problem we gotta fix. - [hissing] What the fuck's taking so long? - Relax. My man'll signal us when it's time. - What's the signal? - Soon as Chao comes out, we go in. - Get the fuck off me. - Hold him. - [struggling] [gags] [henchmen laughing, Chao gagging] [laughter continues] - [chuckles] - [sputtering and coughing] [laughter continues] - Was that so fuckin' hard? [henchmen laugh] A toast to our new brother. - [panting] - Big fuckin' balls and all. [henchmen cheer] [approaching laughter] - He's so fuckin' sick. - What is this? - Hey, the fuck you doin' here? ♪ ♪ - I'm with Chao. ♪ ♪ [dissonant notes] [groans softly] [blade swishes] [intense music] ♪ ♪ - [coughs] - [chuckles] - [panting] To the Fung Hai! [cheers] The itchiest motherfuckers I know! [cheers] - This motherfucker's Long Zii! [dramatic percussion] [apprehensive music] - [grunts] - Where's the other one? ♪ ♪ Hurt him badly, but keep him alive. I wanna know what he had planned. Alive! ♪ ♪ - [huffs angrily] - [grunts] [coughs and pants] [tense spaghetti western music] ♪ ♪ [men grunt] [music heightens] ♪ ♪ [henchmen cheering and laughing] ♪ ♪ [henchmen exclaim] [both grunting] [all shouting] [both groan] [all shouting] - [screams] ♪ ♪ - [gasps and groans] ♪ ♪ [suspenseful music] - Li Yong. ♪ ♪ - Let's see how those big balls handle steel, motherfucker. [henchmen laugh] [pistol hammer clicks] - What was that? - That's our cue, boys. Let's go! Let's go! - Move! Let's go! - Let's go, let's go, let's go! ♪ ♪ - [shouts] - [pants] - [grunts] You're out of bullets, asshole. [pistol hammer clicks] - Wrong. [gunfire and shouting] - Men, keep going! - Come on, right through here. - Right this way. [soft, suspenseful music] - So... we're finally gonna find out who's better. ♪ ♪ - I never really wondered. - [chuckles softly] Then I guess you'll just have to humor me. I should tell you, once I kill you, I'll go and see Mai Ling. I'm gonna fuck her like she never been fucked. After that, I'll eat her fuckin' heart and piss in the hole. And all because you didn't have the balls to say "fuck you" to my face. - [chuckles] Fuck you.

I'd pat you two on the backs, but quite frankly, this feels like a case of dumb fuckin' luck. You two get your asses downstairs. We've got an unholy mess to mop up. - Yes, sir. That's the closest he's ever come to a compliment, by the way. - He's right-- about luck. We come here for one reason, and we find this sword and watch, handy as a rope at a hangin'. - I assume you've heard the one about the gift horse, yeah? - Yeah, I-I'm just saying that the Fung Hai had reason to come after you. That makes sense. But why Timmons and McCormick? Why the men at the Banshee? It doesn't add up. - For fuck's sake, Lee. We won. We got our fuckin' man. The sword, the watch... it doesn't make sense because chinks don't make sense. They never will. Jesus, Lee. Would it kill you to be happy about something for two seconds? - You're right. We won.
