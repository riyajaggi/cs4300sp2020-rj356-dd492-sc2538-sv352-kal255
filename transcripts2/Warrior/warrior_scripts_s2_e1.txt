 ♪ (MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ (MEN YELL) You think you can take me on? AH SAHM: The right question, is do you really wanna find out? Do you really think father would have wanted you to cross us all just to get yourself killed? You just got here, and already you joined my enemies, gotten yourself arrested. Not only are you with a white lady, it's the mayor's wife.

 What are you going to do next? It's good to see you too. PENELOPE: Ah Sahm, the Irish have resorted to violence. We need protection. (GRUNTING) ‐I'm gonna find you. ‐I hope so. MAI LING: There is going to be a war between the tongs, and if you're on the wrong side... I won't hesitate. This is not China, it's China Town. You can't stop what's happening. Mai Ling, she's my sister. WOMAN: She was your sister. Here, she's your enemy.

 MAYOR BLAKE: They're getting bolder, coming into our neighborhoods now, killing on our streets. The mayor has asked me to start a new China Town squad. MAN: The mayor now has to show he's hard on China Town crime. He couldn't care less where the handle falls. But luckily I have you to aim the hammer. I'll need to see blood in the streets. You'll have your blood. MAN 2: They want a war, let's give them one. (MEN YELL) MAN 3: Things have gotten out of hand. Two fighters, the best from each of your tongs. A duel? MAI LING: You can't fight. LI Yong will kill you. I think if I win your little power play is over. You killed Long Zii. (LONG ZII GROANS) Who the hell are you? Good bye, Ah Sahm. MAN 3: You ready for this? LI YONG: Only one of us is going to walk out of there. MAN 4: This is a means for the tongs to settle their disputes. MAI LING: This game is inevitable. (CROWD CHEERS) (WOMAN SCREAMS) (GUN FIRES) (CROWD YELLS) MAN 5: This was a victory for your tong, but as you can imagine, I'm not happy about it. If you take one step out of line, I won't stop until I have your pretty little head on this table. MAN 5: What about Ah Sahm? MAN 6: He's of no use to us anymore. MAN 7: This is what it's come to. AH SAHM: I'm not different than anyone else here. Come on. We both know that's not true. The king is dead, long live the queen. YOUNG JUN: You don't need to do this anymore. I want you to come back. AH TOY: You're alive. It's starting to feel that way. It's gonna get messy. Probably. MAN 8: Warriors have only two paths. Get killed, or get better. ♪ (MUSIC CONCLUDES) ♪ [engine revs] [man breathing heavily] ‐ [spits] [rousing spaghetti western music] ♪ ♪ [crowd shouting and cheering] ♪ ♪ [growls] [crowd exclaims] [shouting and cheering continue] [crowd exclaims] ♪ ♪ ‐ [chokes] ♪ ♪ ‐ [breathing heavily] ‐ Ready?

Well... ‐ What about you? What are you doing here, Ah Sahm? ‐ Same as everyone else. ‐ Everyone else needs the money‐‐you don't. The tongs take care of their own. So the question is, what's a Chinatown hatchet man doing in a Barbary Coast fight pit? Hmm? What are you looking for? ‐ Just staying sharp. ‐ Whenever you're ready to change your answer, I'm your girl. Whatever it is, I'm betting I can help. ‐ Thanks. I don't need any help. ‐ See you soon. [dramatic spaghetti western music] [fighter shouts, punch lands] ♪ ♪ [solemn piano music] ♪ ♪ ‐ Was that your wife? ‐ Yes. And my two boys. ‐ Oh. Ian and Daniel. I‐I'm so sorry. How did it happen? ‐ Smallpox. Eight years ago. We just moved out here from New York when it spread. ‐ How awful. ‐ They'd be young men now. [wind whistles softly] What are you doing? ‐ My father's buried just up the hill, and they refresh his flowers twice a week, and that's too many flowers for any man, don't you think? I like to spread them out around the other graves. ‐ I'm sure your father would appreciate that. ‐ Well, I'm working under the general assumption that he would've fucking hated it. ‐ [chuckles] ‐ You find that funny? ‐ I just didn't know proper women like you swore like that. ‐ Huh. You don't strike me as a man who spends a lot of time among proper women. ‐ You're quick to judge, aren't you? ‐ You're the one who immediately decided that I was proper. ‐ So I did. My apologies. ‐ Apologies accepted. Well, uh, I'll let you get back to your visit. ‐ [clears throat] [intimidating western music] ♪ ♪ ‐ What? Thanks, kid. ♪ ♪ ‐ I thought you were done with the Barbary Coast. ‐ Ah... I guess not. ‐ You're not gonna find what you're looking for there. ‐ You don't know what I'm looking for. ‐ You're looking for weakness, the flaw in your technique that allowed Li Yong to beat you. Like I said, you're not gonna find it. ‐ Well, sometimes it's more about the searching and less about what you find. ‐ What does that mean? ‐ I don't know. I thought we were just trading clichés. ‐ Okay. No more clichés. ‐ Okay. I saw these guys at the fight. They wore cut‐off queues on their jackets. ‐ They call themselves teddy boys. I've seen them. Those queues they wear are part of their initiation. You want to join, a Chinese scalp is your way in. ‐ I was thinking we should pay them a visit. ‐ Not now. We've been too active lately. ‐ We leave 'em alone, tomorrow they take another Chinese scalp. ‐ And if we keep leaving a trail of dead white people, we'll become the threat to ourselves and Chinatown. ‐ [grunts] You asked for my help. ‐ This isn't help. This is just you looking for another fight. Fight pits, teddy boys‐‐ you're looking to win a fight that's already over. ‐ And we're back to clichés. ‐ [sighs] ‐ You can come or not, but I'm going back. [tense music] Tonight. ‐ [sighs] ‐ I'm going back tonight. And if I tell them you didn't have the money, it'll be very bad for you. ‐ They're fucking chinks, Bill. They don't even belong here. They got no fucking right. ‐ You gambled, and you lost. ‐ They rigged it! There's not an honest table in all of Chinatown. ‐ But that didn't stop you, though, did it? ‐ So what you gonna do? Break my leg? You're a fucking highbinder now? ‐ Whatever I do... won't be as bad as what they'll do to you. ‐ I got no money, Bill. Not a red fucking cent. ‐ What about that ring? ‐ This was my father's. ‐ Yeah? And what would he say now? [tense music] ♪ ♪ ‐ Listen... I understand how close you were with your father. ‐ Thank you. ‐ So, when you decided to run his factory yourself, I did my best to be supportive. ‐ And I appreciate that. ‐ But now the mayor's wife has a hundred coolies working for her. Do you understand the position you're putting me in? ‐ A very good one with the industrialists, I should think. They're very passionate about Chinese labor. ‐ I'm trying to remain impartial. ‐ And I'm trying to save my business. ‐ I know Lymon Merriweather has made a generous offer to buy you out. ‐ Mercer Steel is my father's legacy. ‐ So sell the damn thing! Use the proceeds to start a‐‐ [pleasantly] Charity in his memory. ‐ I'm sorry. Am I interrupting? ‐ Sophie. Yes. And not a moment too soon. ‐ Good morning, Mr. Mayor. ‐ Sophie. I've asked you repeatedly to call me Samuel. ‐ Oh, I know. It just feels so wrong. ‐ Sophie. ‐ Fine. Samuel. Will you please pass the berries, Samuel? ‐ If you'll excuse me. ‐ Oh, we will, Samuel. ‐ We'll pick this up another time. Ladies. ‐ Samuel. [chuckles softly] [laughs] Your husband has the shape of a potato. ‐ You should be more respectful. You're living in his house. ‐ Mm, I prefer to think of it as your house. Luckily, you can't ship me off to boarding school like you did Nadine. ‐ For the last time, I didn't ship her off. She chose to go. ‐ I know. Sorry. I just‐‐I miss her. ‐ I do, too. ‐ [chuckles] ‐ You know, I heard from Mrs. Thornhill the other day. Her son, Spencer, would like to call on you. ‐ Oh, really? ‐ Yes. ‐ [chuckling] No. ‐ Apparently, he caught sight of you somewhere and hasn't stopped talking about you. ‐ He caught sight of me at our father's funeral. And a man who becomes infatuated with a grieving woman has issues that... [laughing] I'm not interested in unraveling. ‐ You're impossible. You manage to disqualify every man that comes your way. ‐ I'm discerning. You should try it sometime. I'm sorry. That was a mean thing to say. I love you, but I wish you'd stop trying to take care of me all the time. ‐ Someone has to. ‐ [scoffs, laughs] [indistinct chatter] [mysterious music] ♪ ♪ ‐ Mai Ling, we're honored. ‐ Thank you. ‐ What can I get you? ‐ I see you have a new batch of lemons. ‐ Yes. Just arrived this morning from Los Angeles. ‐ [coughing heavily] ‐ Your wife looks ill. She needs to see a doctor. ‐ I told her that, but... she insists it takes two of us to run the store. I'll take her after we close. ‐ [wheezing] [hacking] ‐ I'll take it all. ‐ What? ‐ All of it. Everything in the stand. You take her to see a doctor. ‐ So you just show up whenever you feel like it, they put you against some other onion, and you scrap? ‐ You should try it sometime. ‐ [chuckles] I'll leave that kung fu shit to you. Fighting without knives doesn't sound like a lot of fun. ‐ Ah, it's not meant to be fun. ‐ Well, then why even bother? ‐ Ah... ‐ Can you believe this shit? I can't believe Father Jun just agreed to this. Walking around like she owns the fucking place. [spits] [tense music] ‐ Come on. Let's go. ♪ ♪ ‐ It's a delicate situation, what with her father's passing. But the mayor's wife hiring coolie labor is problematic. ‐ Really, Buckley? You think so? What a brilliant summation. Why don't you go negotiate with my obstinate wife, and I'll stand around thinking up new and exciting ways to state the painfully obvious. ‐ If pressure at home won't work, perhaps the way through is to take a more powerful public position. Come down hard on Chinese labor. Let no one doubt where you stand. ‐ Won't that just make me look like even more of a hypocrite? ‐ At the risk of stating the obvious, I'm afraid that ship has sailed. Thanks to your wife, I mean. In the meantime, maybe I can bring pressure to bear on Mrs. Blake from other fronts. ‐ You mean the workingmen? ‐ I'll continue to stoke that fire. ‐ Or we could just adjust her pricing so that she can afford to hire Irish labor and be done with it. ‐ And if the press got wind that you were giving your wife favorable pricing? The last thing you want to do now is to invite more scrutiny. ‐ Might I remind you that it was you who pressured Mercer into hiring coolie labor to begin with? ‐ Yes, to protect you, which I am still trying to do. You must know that people are whispering. ‐ Don't say it. ‐ A man who can't control his wife‐‐ ‐ [quietly] I said don't. [footsteps retreat and fade] ‐ Very well, sir. ‐ Mai Ling's walking around like the motherfucking queen of Chinatown. The Fung Hai are all over us, which never would've happened if we hadn't bent over for them! ‐ You're worried too much about public perception. Don't concern yourself with how things look. Concern yourself with how things are. ‐ "How things are" is we look weak! And the other tongs are gonna start getting ideas. ‐ The Hop Wei were around before Mai Ling got here. It would take a lot more than her childish posturing to damage our reputation. The Long Zii's alliance with the Fung Hai will be her undoing. If she doesn't break the treaty, they will. And then... we can strike with the full support of the Six Companies. ‐ Fuck the Six Companies. They're not the ones going to war with us. ‐ Don't be an idiot. You lose the Six Companies, you lose Chinatown. Get me? ‐ No! I don't get you! At least she was fucking Long Zii. What's your excuse? [tense music] ♪ ♪ ‐ Something else you want to say? ♪ ♪ ‐ Solid gold‐‐ a family heirloom. ‐ You cold motherfucker, Bill. ‐ Listen... I've done this thing for you long enough. ‐ Long enough? For what? ‐ I paid my debt. ‐ [sighing] Oh. This not debt. This your job. ‐ NO, it's not. I am a police officer, for fuck's sake! ♪ ♪ ‐ The mouth pray to Buddha, but the heart...

No? ♪ ♪ ‐ [sighs] [indistinct chatter and laughter] ‐ I had a feeling I'd find you here. The fruit. ‐ It's Tomb‐Sweeping Day. I'm paying my respects to our parents. ‐ Oh. [scoffs] If they could see us now. ‐ Ah Sahm. ‐ You tried to have me diced. ‐ I tried to save you. I did everything I could to keep you out of that tournament. ‐ And then you ordered my death. Hmm? It's okay. You made your choice. Now I've made mine. ‐ Oh, come on. Father Jun's not gonna live forever. And Young Jun's no boss. So who's gonna lead the Hop Wei? ♪ ♪ What, you? [music darkens] ‐ If I have to. ♪ ♪ ‐ I just hope you realize you're backing a losing side before it's too late. ‐ You know, you should hear yourself talk sometime. You're always so... [breathes deeply] [quietly] You're always so damn superior. Even when we were kids, you were always so sure you were right. Everyone else was wrong. ‐ Not everyone. Just you. ‐ [sighs] ‐ If you really think I'm wrong, why are you here right now? They tossed you out like you were nothing. Left you to rot, and now you're wearing their colors again. Just think about it. We could be on the same side. ‐ Hmm. [chuckles] You mean your side. ♪ ♪ Xiaojing? ♪ ♪ You're gonna wish you had killed me. ♪ ♪ ‐ There's always tomorrow. ♪ ♪ ‐ [breathes deeply] [sighs] ‐ Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. I was just admiring your focus. ‐ [sighs] Thank you. ‐ Mm. Young Jun can use a bit of that focus. He's too easily riled up. ‐ Ah, he's just looking out for the tong. [clears throat] ‐ I don't doubt it. I've been trying to teach him patience for years. The teacher can open the door, but the student must walk through it. We haven't really talked since you returned to the tong. ‐ [sighs] I know it wasn't your idea to bring me back. ‐ Are you and I going to have a problem? ‐ No. ‐ Good. Keep an eye on Young Jun for me. As you know, he can get a bit too itchy for his own good. [building percussive music] ♪ ♪ ‐ [grunting and shouting] [shouts angrily] [indistinct chatter] [door creaks] ‐ You're home early. ‐ Well...

And I have not been to the tables, if that's what that look means. ‐ What look? ‐ You know damn well what look. Bet you came out of the womb with that look. ‐ No. I hadn't met you yet then, had I? ‐ [chuckles] Nice. [liquid pouring] I got rid of a couple of hooligans who were loitering around Quinn's slaughterhouse last week. Ever since, the old man, he likes to... have me swing by and check on him. So... steak. ‐ Okay, then. [pan sizzling] ‐ She knew I was lying through my goddamn teeth. I could tell.

Thank you. Would you like to join us? ‐ Thanks for the offer, but I have a prior engagement. I'll just collect your dues and be on my way. ‐ Dues? We just started working last week. ‐ And you've been paid, which is more than we can say about a lot of other people around here. Today you're the fortunate ones.

I paid a few onions to go into one of the Long Zii dens. This is what they're using. ‐ [sniffs] It's molasses. So what? ‐ I'm not worried about what it is. I'm worried about what it isn't. And it isn't from China, which means the Long Zii are paying less for it, which explains how they can charge less, which explains why we're losing customers. ‐ You take this to Father Jun? ‐ Father Jun will never stop ordering from China. He's too afraid of pissing off the Six Companies. ‐ Well, that was when we didn't have to compete. [sighs] Now we do. ‐ No shit. ‐ Would he know? ‐ What? ‐ You're the one who places the orders, right? We could set up a local source. Father Jun doesn't have to know about it. ‐ He'll eventually find out. ‐ Well, you know what I always say. Better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission. We lost a lot of chop by cutting Mai Ling in. We could offset some of that if we stopped importing. ‐ [exhales deeply] We'd need a local source we can trust. ‐ [grunts] [sniffs] So we'll find one.

No wonder he feels he can keep doing it. ‐ It's not one person... at least not this time. These two here were killed by their own knives and, by the looks of it, put up quite a fight. These other three and the man back there were killed by a sword. There was more than one attacker here. ‐ For fuck's sake! You're the one who's been telling me all this time that we were looking for one man. ‐ Yeah, and now I'm the one who's telling you we're not! ‐ What the hell was that? ‐ I have no idea. ‐ I don't need to remind you about all the shit I'm getting from on high. And believe me, there's a lot of it. And it all rolls downhill. If you and your squad can't find me at least one fucking swordsman, I'll get someone who can. ‐ We're doing everything we can. ‐ Well, do more of it. And you get your boy Lee in line!

To be honest, I enjoyed it. ‐ [chuckles] ‐ You still getting the headaches? ‐ Yeah. ‐ And the laudanum's not helping? ‐ Uh, no. ‐ It's been what, two months? What does the doctor say? ‐ He says there's a lot we don't understand about head injuries. ‐ You think maybe you should take some time off? ‐ I think maybe we should go talk to Chao. ‐ We've talked to Chao plenty! ‐ And he's still holding out on us.

I did my best to be supportive, but now the mayor's wife has a hundred coolies working for her. Do you understand the position you're putting me in? The thorn in the side of that is the Irish thugs. They resent the fact that she's hiring Chinese labor. Mercer Steel is my father's legacy. Just sell the damn thing! I'm sorry, am I interrupting? We meet Sophie in the first episode of season two. She's moved in with me and Blake. So, Sophie is Penny Blake's younger sister. She's got a rebellious streak, and she's very outgoing. So I think when she first sees Leary in the cemetery, she is genuinely curious. You don't strike me as a man who spends a lot of time among proper women. You're quick to judge, aren't ya? It isn't until he starts making assumptions about her that it becomes a bit more playful and flirtatious between them. She's intrigued, because she's never met anyone like Leary before. As a loyal American, I sentence you to death. ‐Who the fuck are you? ‐That's not important right now. (ALL YELLING, GRUNTING) So, at the beginning of season two, we see Ah Toy and Ah Sahm team up to fight the Teddy Boys. So we see what ruthless vigilantes they make. Ah Toy has always sort of picked her moments to really strike on behalf of the Chinese people. She's been a quiet vigilante for years. We've been too active lately. Leave them alone, tomorrow they take another Chinese scalp. And if we keep leaving a trail of dead white people, we'll become a threat to ourselves and China Town. Unlike Ah Toy, Ah Sahm isn't as wise about knowing when to lay low and when to strike. He sort of becomes addicted to the vengeance of it. Now that Ah Sahm is doing it with her, the stakes have kind of gotten bigger because it's bringing more heat onto China Town, and it's bringing more police attention. If you and your squad can't find me at least one fucking swordsman, I'll get someone who can. We pick up Bill, and he's still got the pressure from Flanagan to find the swordsman. Lee's become so obsessed with this pursuit of the swordsman, he's trying to get any information he can, in a very dogged way. And outside of that, he's using laudanum to dull the pain and the anxiety from his head injury. A lot of Lee's negative qualities have kind of been dialed up to 11. The introduction of Mai Ling in season two was me walking down the China Town streets like the new queen. ‐I'll take it all. ‐What? All of it. Everything in the stand. DIANNE DOAN: It's important for me to interact with my people. I want to be accepted and loved, and throughout the season you'll see Mai Ling establishing her power even more. Mai Ling's walking around like the motherfucking queen of China Town. The Fung Hai are all over us, which never would have happened if we hadn't bent over for them. Father Jun and Young Jun, they're kind of like yin and yang. Oil and water. Young Jun's saying Father Jun's getting old. He's not able to make good decisions for the Hop Wei. Young Jun clearly feels that the Hop Wei have the power and the numbers to solve the territorial dispute, whereas Father Jun is older, wiser, and wants a much more nuanced approach. The Hop Wei are going through some growing pains right now. Young Jun and Ah Sam are really upset with Father Jun for giving Mai Ling entrée into the opium trade and they feel they've shown real weakness. They're full of vim and vigor. They wanna take over. We lost a lot of chop by cutting Mai Ling in. We could offset some of that if we stopped importing. Father Jun doesn't have to know about it. We need to locate a source we can trust. So we'll find one. ♪ (MUSIC CONCLUDES) ♪
