 Open the fuckin' bag, you punk. I don't understand how the little shits can even stand to be around themselves. Hey, Chingchong, do you smell yourself? Yeah? Yeah?

You sticking up for your little buddy over there? ♪ ♪ I asked you a question, slant. - He don't understand shit. - Yeah? Well, he better learn it fast, because if he don't answer me now, he's gonna bleed all over that fancy shirt of his. [BROODING GUITAR NOTES] [WIND WHISTLING] ♪ ♪ I wouldn't do that again if I were you. Fucking slant can talk American! Holy shit. Do it again. Say something. I didn't travel halfway across the world in that damn boat just to amuse a few fat white fucks. There. I said something. You think because you speak American, you can talk shit to me? Well, you have to admit, it helps. ♪ ♪ This uppity chink needs to learn his place. You think you can take me on? That's the wrong question. Oh, yeah? What's the right one?

Fast as shit. Went through them like they weren't even there. No shit. Three of them, huh? This one, he's very well-trained. I thought I'd bring him here first. Hmm. Just crossed? Today. You know who we are? Yeah, black and red. Hop Wei. Three bulls, huh? [CHUCKLES] Nah, I don't think so. I'm guessing they don't pay you to do the thinking. - [LAUGHS] - Fuck did you say? This fucking onion's itchy. I like it. I like it. [FOREBODING MUSIC] - The usual? - Mm-hmm. [PAPER RUSTLING] ♪ ♪ So... this is a new one? Chao says he can scrap. Chao can be a fucking pain in the ass, but he's generally right about these things. - What's your name? - Ah Sahm. Where are you from? Fo Shan. Who trained you? Sifu Li Qiang. Hmm. ♪ ♪ War is coming between the tongs. If you can scrap, you're in. ♪ ♪ Young Jun will get you settled. Tomorrow we'll start to work you and then see what you're worth. ♪ ♪ Ah Sahm. Did I just get off a boat? Excuse me? I asked if I was the one that just crossed the salt on a fucking boat. No, you're not. No, I'm not. What I am is the boss of the most powerful tong in Chinatown. What you are is 1 in 25,000 broke Chinese fucking nationals I just bought for the price of a shitty bottle of wine. I tell you this, at the risk of stating the obvious, to remind you that you are a fucking onion! And before a fucking onion turns away from me, he'd better fucking bow. A word of warning. You wanna be careful how you speak to Father Jun. Yeah. Does he always have that stick jammed up his ass like that? Yes, and I would know, since he's my father. Shit. Hey. - I meant no disrespect. - Really? 'Cause it sounded like that's exactly what you meant. - No, I-I... - "No, I"... [LAUGHS] I'm just fucking with you, man. [LAUGHS] Not the part of about him being my father. That part's true. I'm the spawn of a whore and the most powerful boss in Chinatown. How I got this pretty is anybody's guess. [LAUGHS] Look. Father Jun can be a hard-ass, okay? That's because he's the real deal. He scrapped against the British navy during the Opium Wars. Battle of Shanghai. A fishing junk with a couple of shitty cannons against a British warship. He swam over and diced the whole fucking crew with a sword. Point is: he may be older now, but you never wanna fuck with him. - You get me? - Yeah, I get you. Okay. House rules: you're not skinned in yet, so you stay in your room, unless you need to take a piss or a shit. Use the toilet down the hall. Get some rest. We're gonna start working you in tomorrow.

If I let you waste away, your father will have words for me. ♪ ♪ [KNOCK AT DOOR] Buckley! What brings you here? Good morning, Mr. Mayor. Mrs. Blake. How are the newlyweds? What's wrong, Buckley? Please. Two chinamen were killed last night over on Howard Street. Yes, and? They were working on the Merriweather building. From what I gather, a couple of Labor thugs smashed their heads in with hammers. - Oh, my God. - Shit. Press? Not yet, but we arrested a few, so they'll sniff it out soon enough. Let's see if we can shut that down. I don't need any more attention from Sacramento. Yes, by all means, let's keep murder out of the paper. These are affairs of state, dear. And they don't concern you. And yet I'm concerned. You're sure they were Merriweather's? The development on Broome. God damn it. He'll want to be compensated. - Let's go. - They're people, you know. And the government treats them like just another legislative problem to be solved. Careful, dear. You're married to the government. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] ♪ ♪ Two men were put through central booking. One prior arrest each for minor offenses. They spent the night in holding. How fast can we get them arraigned? I want them in and out before the reporters have finished breakfast. Well, they're on this morning's docket, - but it's a busy one. - Well, see what you can do. - Good morning. - Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Mr. Mayor. Merriweather is going to have a conniption. We promised him protection. The Workingmen's movement is growing right along with the unemployment numbers. - Leary is out for blood. - Good morning. Good to see you again. Leary is not going - to fund my campaign. - Very true. I'm telling you, it's getting worse. They used to just beat the Chinese. Now they're killing them in the streets. And murder's never good for reelection. Neither is running afoul of Leary and the Irish vote. Go see Merriweather, first thing. Maybe you can calm him down before he gets worked up. Little late for that. [SIGHS] Mr. Merriweather! You got an early start. Please. Tea, coffee? Or would you like something stronger? - No, thank you. - Please, uh, take a seat. You promised me protection, Blake. These were skilled bricklayers. There are presumably plenty more where they came from. Lymon, what do you want me to do? My men can handle the sites, but they cannot police Chinatown. That is your job. I've got 1/4 million people in this city and only 75 cops. Then I suggest you figure something out fast... for both our sakes. [FOREBODING MUSIC] ♪ ♪ [EXHALES DEEPLY] [OVERLAPPING CHATTER] ♪ ♪ And here he is. Bill, you know Mr. Buckley. Of course. How are you, Mr. Buckley? Chief Flannagan tells me you're our man in Chinatown. I guess so. The mayor would like to form a Chinatown squad. And I'd like you to head it up. I was told I'd be transferred out by year's end. No one knows Chinatown like you do, Bill. Four men should do it. And yourself, of course. [SIGHS] With all due respect, sir, it's high risk, with no real chance for advancement. No one's gonna volunteer for this. Well, then it's a good thing you outrank them. From the mayor himself. Congratulations, Sergeant. Chief. This is bullshit. Course it's bullshit. That was a politician speaking, wasn't it? Blake has to show the barons he's protecting their interests and show everybody else he's cracking down on the chinks. Look, Bill, it's a straight climb up the ladder without kissing a single arse. So what? Now I've got to pick four men? I've taken the liberty. McLeod, Harrison, Stone, and Keller? Are you kidding me? It's bad enough with you in that shithole. I can't waste any more good cops on the Chinese problem. Keller's an opium addict. You wanna put him in Chinatown? Okay, fine, pick a fourth. But no one I'll miss. [SIGHS] [CHUCKLES] This is a steaming pile of horseshit. It's pageantry, Bill. Just put on a good show. The state versus Morgan and Davis. Murder in the first. And how do the defendants plead? They're innocent, Your Honor. In fact, they never should've even been locked up in the first place. I have filed a motion to dismiss, on the grounds that there is not a single eyewitness account of this alleged crime. Your Honor, uh, one of the arresting officers - will stand as an eyewitness. - Is he present? Present, Your Honor. And who are you? Officer Richard Henry Lee, Your Honor. And you're prepared to testify for the prosecution? I am. Good. Proceed. Mr. Prosecutor, did you finalize a trial date? - Yes, Your Honor. - Uh, the 14th? - Your Honor. - Good, thank you. Hiyah! [TENSE MUSIC] [DOOR CLICKS OPEN] Don't hurt yourself. Get ready. Meet me outside. Right now, there's plenty of protection and gambling to go around. But the molasses? That's our fucking bowl. Mm-hmm. We built an entire opium network from the ground up. Paid off the ports on both sides. Then we had some trouble back in China. Someone fucked someone who knew the emperor's nephew. I don't know. Point is, we went a few months without molasses; Long Zii moved in with lower prices. - It's business, right? - Yeah. Wrong. We're gonna take it all back and bleed those fuckers out for good. [OVERLAPPING CHATTER] What? I just, um... I see a lot of men. Where are the women? Oh. Thought you'd never ask. Come on. Let's go get you some sticky. [LAUGHS] Come on, put your bowl down. Let's go. [SMOOTH ROCK MUSIC] ♪ ♪ Your average Chinese onion can't afford to bring his wife across the salt, so almost all the women that come here are the ones that are sold in China. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm good. - Mm. Now, there are whorehouses up and down Waverly. But it's mostly steakhouse, the discount shit. Ah Toy has the premium girls. She's like a fucking curator of pussy. Did someone mention my name? Ah Toy. [CHUCKLES] Young Jun. - Good evening. - How's your father? - He's very well, thank you. - Good. - Who do we have here? - This is Ah Sahm. - Just crossed. - Fresh off the boat. And how are things in the motherland? Famine, revolution. The usual shit show. So you came west to seek your fortune. Or just not get killed. Around here, that's something of a crapshoot. - Hmm. - So... are you men here for business or business? You know me. [BOTH LAUGH] The insatiable Young Jun. I swear, this boy's cock has its own beating heart. [CHUCKLES] Bum-bum, bum-bum, bum-bum, bum-bum, bum-bum. [CHUCKLES] [HIP-HOP MUSIC] [BELL RINGS] Come on. The bell.

Me and 150,000 Irishmen to fight in Lincoln's war, against other Americans and other Irishmen. I killed men that didn't need killing. - Aye. - Aye. And I saw too many of me own brothers die. - Aye. - Aye. But we won. - We freed the fucking slaves. - Yes. God bless them. They didn't go back home to Africa. No. They came north and took our fucking jobs. - You're welcome. - Aye, aye, aye. And now they're bringing in these Chinese by the boatload. Because the rich men whose fucking war we fought don't wanna pay us a fair day's wage. - Right. - Aye. And what I've come to realize is, this country won't ever stop looking for more fucking subhumans to do our fucking jobs - cheaper than we can. - Fuckin' aye. What they don't see is the cost of that. Because in the long run, it will cost them their fucking country. - Aye. - Yeah. We fought for this country. - We bled for it. - Aye. And now we're gonna save it from itself. And if that means another fucking civil war, - then so be it! - [ALL CHEER] Whatever happens, the Chinese must go. - [BANGS TABLE] - The Chinese must go!

[SNICKERS] Thanks, but if I was looking for dick, I probably wouldn't be in a brothel. You can either come walking, you can come in a fucking bag. Either way, you're coming to see Long Zii. Well, I don't know Long Zii, so I'm just guessing here, but I'm pretty sure he can kiss my salty ass.

Or one of your girls. Same thing, though, right? Hey, new guy, you just got here. Maybe take a minute before you think you've got it all figured out. I may be fresh, but I know when I've been fucked. You got fucked because you spoke your business in a room full of whores. This is not China. It's Chinatown. And our blood is cheap here, so you'd better learn to adapt. You understand? [CHUCKLES] If I say yes, will this conversation be over? You're not the typical hatchet man. [SOFT MUSIC] You didn't come all this way just to scrap for the Hop Wei. ♪ ♪ You need someone you can trust. Someone outside the tong. And you're saying that's you?
