 Git. I said git. Mom, he's deaf. He is disobedient. He's 18. Well, he is shedding like the dickens. Okay, you, up. I'm sick. I need to rest. Rrr-Rest. That's what I just said.

 What happened to your Rs, Kate? You used to say them so beautifully. I don't know what you're doing out there in Los Angeles, but you have to keep it up every night before bed, just like we used to. Rrrr. Now come on. Get up. I will be damned if I'm gonna sit around here and watch you mope over some man. Let's go. Come on. I need help with Granny's birthday party. Now where's your suitcase? What? I had to catch a flight. Oh, my Lord. Maybe you really are sick.

 Okay. Let's, uh... Let's see about... I'm sure this will still fit. Hey. Okay, now get dressed. You have errands to run. And wear that pretty hair down so your chin don't look so pointy. Start with the cake! Oh, God. She's very, um... particular. Yeah. I knew that was you in there. Hi, Shep. Oh, wow. So what are you doing home? Oh, you know, just a little vacay. Also it's my granny's birthday. Blythe's got you on an impossible mission. Mm-hmm. Always. Well... I'm off. Oh, okay. Uh, it was good... good to see you. I'm going this way. How can I help you? You work here? It's mine now. I was... I was really sorry when I heard about your mom. Yeah, I got your card. It was very sweet. Uh, but it's really okay. We're just relieved she's not in pain anymore. Of course. Fuck. I wish I remembered more. You look the same. So how's Candace? She's great. She's with her boyfriend in Florida. Hey, Uncle Shep, you want me to take these to the... That is not Nathan? Yeah. He shaves and everything. Nathan, this is Kate, an old friend. Hi. How's it going? Could you go ahead and take that over to St. Francis? Cool. See you. Bye. I had no idea about Candace. I'm really sorry. It's fine. It's for the best, really. So what do we need? Uh, two large arrangements for the back and eight smaller ones for the tables. Uh, it's Blythe, so I would imagine fairly traditional. Probably. I mean, I don't know. What are my options? Can I show you? So... Did she have Ms. Pearl as her coach, too? She's still coaching? My goodness. Emmaline is on the J.V. squad now, isn't she? For now. Kate just loved cheerleading. It made music visual for me, and it got me out of gym class, so... Were the girls nice to you? Sometimes they are so mean to Emmaline. Some. It took me too long to realize it had nothing to do with being the deaf girl. Blythe, this Russian tea is just too good. I can't stop drinking it. Oh, drink as much as you want, honey. It's a holiday staple, and there's an endless supply. Why Russian, though? You know, I haven't the slightest. Oh, did I tell you Chuck's sister fainted at Thanksgiving? Really? No, you didn't. Is she all right? She's fine, but when she hit that kitchen floor, you would have thought that the Lord was returning. Oh, God. Blythe, I simply cannot - thank you enough for arranging all this. - What?! Goodness knows we've been talking about this moment since we met. Hollis, doesn't Emmaline remind you of Kate? Stop it! You know sign language? Not really, no. Her dad was fluent, and after he passed, I tried, but... Mom said deaf people who sign don't like getting implants. My daddy always used to say nobody builds a house with just a saw if they have an entire toolbox, so that's why he gave me the box, so I could decide for myself. He felt that signing would, you know, keep her on track language-wise. Well, you speak very well for a deaf person. Thank you. We practiced together every single night. How old was, um, Emmaline when she got her implant? Well, she was just a toddler, and I will never forget the moment when we turned them on and we watched her little face respond to sound for the first time. So there's the door. - I'm gonna get it. - Oh, let me. - Sorry about that. - No. Hey, Nathan. Order for Bailey. That's me. What are these? Flowers. What on Earth have you done, Kate? They're perfect, very Granny. Shep is really good at this. They are so me. Oh, thank you, Kate. Wildflowers for a wild party. Go, Granny. Go, Granny... Okay, stop! Just stop it! Hmm, I can't wait to see the cake. What is the problem? Look, I know that you throw parties for a living, but you just seem to be deliberately trying to mess everything up. I mean, why don't you just drive your car through the gazebo again? That was 15 years ago. Yes. Well, what has happened to you? You used to be such an agreeable girl. No, I wasn't. I just couldn't understand half of what people were saying. That's just not true. You always understood me. No. I was pretending. Well, why on Earth didn't you just tell me that before? Why didn't you notice it? Okay, just stop. You just stop it right now. You hear me? No! I fucking can't! I know you always wanted the perfect daughter, and instead, you got me. You think I chose to be like this to... to spite you? Where's the vodka? Mama, listen. You're right. I have changed. I have a deaf friend now finally. I can choose how I want to communicate. I can be me, the real me. I don't have to pretend anymore. Um, we, um... we have to use the, uh, Miss America glasses for the party tonight, and they have to be washed by hand, and I just... I don't have time. What can I do to help? Well, there are 50 of them, so why don't you just run a big sink of soapy water and get started, okay? Thanks, honey. I swear, I don't even know what Daddy saw in her. What were they even like together, anyway? They had the picket fence... but no dog in the yard. And instead of 2.5 kids... One disabled girl. Oh! Were you in love with Granddaddy? Pfft! I married him, because I wanted kids. Can't do that by yourself. At least, not back when I was ovulating. Have you ever been in love? That's a complicated question, baby doll. And what the hell are we talking about when we talk about those things, anyway? You get up in the morning, you do the best you can, you spend time with people who make you happy, and you go to bed. Who makes you happy? My friends. Me, too. Ooh! - My God. - Don't sweat it. She'll never notice. Are you joking? Of course I'm joking! You better get. Put 'em up at the bar, but we'll never use those glasses. Okay, yeah, I want six chairs at every table, please, and if anybody has any ideas about what to do with these flowers, then I would really appreciate it. Thank you. Hey! Wait. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me. I am so fucked. So I'm still going through Mom's things, but she always wanted me to have her kitchen stuff. Not exactly sure why. Hang on. How 'bout these? Thank you. You know she's gonna know, right? It's the thought that counts. What? Nothing. Nah. So how's Danny boy? Fine. I mean, I don't know. He left me. Wow. We're awesome. He's gonna regret that. Oh, I don't know. You seemed to handle it fine. No. No, I didn't. Third time's the charm. Am I right? Can I ask you a question? I mean, maybe... maybe we don't wanna go there, but... What? Uh... how come... Why did you stay in L.A.? How come you never came home? Honestly, because I found somebody else like me. Well, what happened to him? What do you mean? Nothing. He's still around. Is that why Danny broke up with you? Yes, but also no. No, it's not like that. He's gay. Oh. Look... I asked you to come with me. I couldn't leave my mom, Kate. You knew that. But you didn't even visit. I didn't know it was gonna be permanent. What do you want, - an apology? - No. Did you think I was gonna turn down the job because of you? I would have... for you. Shit. Finally! Six of my glasses are missing. Hey. I fucked up. I should have visited you. Stay with me. Stay with me. There's some pickles somewhere... Sweet Lord. You've been home all of five minutes, and you had sex in the basement? We're adults now, Mother, and he asked me to stay. Where? Here, with him. Who? - Shep. - Shep. Absolutely not. You really hate having me here, don't you? I love having you here, but you're better than this, Katherine. I pushed you so hard not because I wanted you to be perfect, but so that you would do better than me. I threw it all away for some boy. I was so proud of you when you didn't. She gave up a lot for you. That's what mothers do. So we're all here tonight to celebrate the grande dame of the evening, Miss Hollis. A woman without whom our lives would be much, much less interesting. But before I give her the microphone, I know that her beloved granddaughter Kate has a few words that she would like to say. Hi, everyone. Thank you for coming. To be honest, I didn't write a speech or anything. I don't even know why I came home. Sorry, Granny. But I didn't plan any of this. I didn't even pack a suitcase, which, if you knew me... I guess... I guess I was looking for something. But being here, I realized I already have that something... people who aren't afraid to push you. Thank you, Granny, for always pushing me. You're the best. I love you, and I'm so happy you're mine. Oh, all right, people. Uh, thanks for coming to my birthday party. I feel so lucky I get to be here, have the family and friends. It's really all about what you get through, and... and we have got through a shit-ton. And while I count myself an optimist, I suspect that I may never have all of you in one place again, so I have to say something. And to the ladies in my chess club, I'm sorry for not running this by you before. I like women. That's right. I, Hollis Bailey, am a lesbian. Yes, I am! Listen. You don't have to pretend to be somebody you're not. I tried to "pass" for so long, I lost myself. Don't do that. You need to find people like you, and you need to do it now.
