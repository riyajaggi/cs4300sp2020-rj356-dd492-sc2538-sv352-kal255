 Pardon? Oh. Three? Is one of you gonna pay or what? Uh, hi. Um, this is Michael Rosen. It's past 9:00. No check-ins. I'm sorry. We tried to, like, get here as soon as we could, but... He can sleep on the couch 'til the intake counselor arrives in the morning, or y'all can check in to a motel nearby.

 One second. Make yourself comfortable. I knew it. I knew it. I told you. I told you, but you don't listen, do you? Because you don't care. I told you that I wasn't gonna be able to sleep a wink without my Tinsley. Judith, I have had it with you and everybody here at New Realms! You good? Yes. So before we start your detox, we need a full inventory of your belongings. You need an interpreter? You deaf?

 I'm gonna have to confiscate your phone. Plus, we need to do a strip-search. Come on. Chop-chop. It's rehab. It's what we do here. Just what do you think you're doing? I'm sorry, Judy. I-I couldn't resist. Back to bed, Noah. You can expect a drug test in the morning. Judy. You were going through his stuff. What'd you think was gonna happen? Good morning. I'm Vincent. Let's, uh, get your intake started and get you into detox. Y-You'll join everyone else after 48 hours. Two days. I'm not gonna tell you to wake up again, Noah. Morning group is in 15. We have your phone. You can check your e-mail in eight days. See you in group. He lives. Sorry. We won't have an interpreter out here for another day. Hold on. Take this to group. This morning, we're gonna check in with our feelings. We are going to pass around this board so everyone can participate, communicate themselves, and feel like they're heard. Okay? "I feel blank... "because I want... blank." Okay? Here you go, Zagat. "I feel pissed." She won't ever shut up about her dog. This is a total violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act that I can't have my service dog here. - Mm-hmm. - Total violation! Noah, what did we talk about? Oh. My bad, Vinnie. Very good, Robbie. "I feel anxious." That is not how you spell Percocet. Well, fuck you! - Hey, hey! - Assault! Assault! Hey, hey, hey. Okay, we are not going to weaponize this white board again. You hear me? What we are gonna do is support each other. They're just awful, depriving me of my service dog, and they can't even get you an interpreter. That's her, Tinsley. My stepdaughter's watching her. She doesn't exactly like dogs. Hmm. I really love the way you listen. I mean, not even listening, but you listen. I knew that you and I were gonna have a deep connection when I saw you check in. Who was that woman with you, by the way? Is that your wife? You looked really sad to see her go. It's no problem. Um... I didn't learn that trick... until my second rehab. I only understood "shit." What? Oh. Um... my mom's sister... Sister. Aunt. Don't worry. I can't have sex. I'm a sex addict. Among other things. I cannot get that sound out of my head when I stepped on her leg and broke it, that scream of pain. When I got in the car, I-I just wasn't thinking. I wanted to get her help. That was all. Michael, it's your turn. I don't know where to start. You can start by talking about what got you in here. Pills. Definitely pills. Oh, no, he looks like a crack kind of guy to me. Fentanyl? I never sucked anybody off for money. I never broke my dog's leg either. Sorry, but my drinking horror stories are not that bad. You need to apologize to Noah and Zagat. And if you can't do that, you need to leave group. Ah. Remember, no breaking eye contact, and you must tell a different truth every time. Ready? Go. Uh... my favorite Disney princess is Moana. I think technically she's not a princess. Switch. Right. I know I'm the crazy dog lady, and I'm fine being the crazy dog lady. Sometimes I'm scared that I don't know how to be in a relationship while sober. Switch. Sometimes I can be a real asshole. You take somebody else... No, no, no, no. Okay, freeze, everyone! With family day coming, are you clear what amends you need to make? Robbie, who would you apologize to? Who's coming for you? Uh, C... Clara. And who's Clara? My daughter. She's 10. Michael? Honestly, I'm not sure. I could invite my husband... who tries so hard every time, and I keep running away. Or I could invite my best friend... who I pretty much treat like shit. Hmm. I don't know how to let people love me. And why is that? I don't know. Turn to your right. You see your child self, exact age you were when it happened. What are you wearing? Are you happy? Sad? What are you afraid of? Okay. Okay. Okay. Where's Noah? Whoa, whoa. Slow down. You're going too fast. I can't understand you. What I'm asking you is where is Noah? Noah, where is he? Robbie. Okay. Zagat. Yeah? He left this morning. Why? He take something of yours? So nice to meet you, Clara. This is Tinsley. Ah. You're so good with dogs, Clara. Tinsley really likes you. Michael, you want to go? I wanted to... I'm sorry. You won't like this, but I want you to stay away from Mom. This is just supposed to be about you and your dad. That's all right. I'm used to Michael thinking of me as the monster. Look, I still remember how scary it was - when you were around. - No. You... You just remember the bad stuff. Because there only was the bad stuff. Okay, I did the best that I knew how to do, the best that I could, 'cause I didn't have anybody to pay for me to go to rehab. I had to figure out a way to get well on my own, so you should give me some credit for that. That's what you want, right? No. All I ever wanted was to keep your mother safe and you and your brother. How? By teaching her how to become a drunk? - By leaving? By leaving us? - You know what? No, no, no. No, you know what? You may have signed up for this, but I didn't. - Fine, fine. - Guys, guys, guys, it can't escalate like this. I don't want to fight again. I-I wanted today to be different, and that's why I'm here. But it can't be, can it?
