 Get off the bar! Oh, shit. Sorry. Kate, the Welder campaign was a disaster. Zero buzz, that's the opposite of viral. The opposite. Right. You're right. I know. That's why I was working so hard to get Ben to sign in the first place. We could have made some noise. Oh, really? Because you butted heads with everyone on his team, and then Ben fired you.

 Well, Ben and I were not a good match. Well, you can't let bad sex turn into bad business. Ah, we've all fucked Ben. Look, Kate, you've been a little off lately. Even I've noticed it. Yeah. I've been trying to cut the negativity out of my life, and I know that that is not an excuse. Listen. You have to compartmentalize if you want to be successful in this business. You just do. PR is all about making things look pretty and sound nice. I mean, do you think when people meet me they think I've been divorced three times

 and that I cry myself to sleep every night? You do? Oh, no. No. That's what Ativan is for. Why did you get into PR? Well, um, I guess because there's so many talented artists with disabilities. They're already out there. They're just not seen. I want to shift the frame and shine a light on them. Wow. That's really beautiful. Kate, you should absolutely do that. Yeah. I should. Wow. Where do we start? I have so many ideas. Oh, no. Honey, no. I'm glad I could help, but you're still fired. When did you fire me? Five minutes ago. Did you miss it? You've got to keep up, Taylor. Oh. Mmm. Thank you. What's wrong? - Aah! - Oh. Oh, no. Waiter! What? Hi. Nice to see you. Yeah. So what brings you in today, Ms. Bailey? I just projectile vomited on my boss, and she fired me. Not because I puked. I just got my flu shot. I was just camping, so maybe I have Lyme disease? Mono? Been making out with all sorts of men. More than making out. Syphilis, it's treatable now, right? Why don't we just run some tests? Wow. Um, hi. Uh, I have news. Um... You're... Yeah. Your doctor called me. I'm still your emergency contact. Um, there's no chance I'm the dad, right? Sorry. I just... I needed to ask. Was that inappropriate? Is it bad that I kind of wish there's a chance? Whoa, whoa, whoa. You seem scared. Why? I don't know what I'm supposed to do. All right. Remember our first day in Thailand, when I choked on a chicken bone? All right, well, you don't know CPR, but you just jumped into action, and you got that little sucker out. Is this is your way of trying to tell me I'm going to be fine? Come here. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's exciting. It's a hard game to break into. 10 mil, Beverly Hills, all from chatting up some divorcée hiking Runyon. Oh, my God. Hi, babe. Champagne? - Yes. - Thank you. To Ryan. Cheers. So I want to hear all about Italy. Ryan said you went to some month-long writer's retreat in the country. Oh, shit. That's why I only sell to investors. Can I get a picture of you two? Sure. One, two... ...three. Thank you. Great. Thanks. Whoo! Fireball time, motherfucker. Amazing. Yes. Yes. Great timing. Oh, my God. What is that? So I'm searching the room, and I... I still can't find my pants, and I get to the window, and I see that they're hanging on the curtain rod under an enormous puddle of pee. And I look out, and yep, I am at the fucking Corn Palace in Mitchell, South Dakota. That's when I knew I was fired and that I needed to get some help.
