 Yeah? All right, come on. I want you to see this place. No, no, no. Come on. The owner is really cool. Please. You'll be happy you did. So he redecorated. What's up, motherfuckers?! I know I'm new here, but I need this first project

 to, you know, be big, all right? I need this first project to make noise. God. I need this first project to, uh, be loud! Fuck. I... This is such a learnable moment for me. I made a list of words I shouldn't say. I need this project to make waves. What are you guys talking about? Uh, I was just saying you're a film producer. You know, like, in the interest of radical transparency, I'm not a "film producer," per se. But I do have money, right? I have infinite money, and money means movies, and movies means a credit by my name. So you guys in, or what?

 Come on. Yeah. Oh! I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. Anyway, do you have more ideas? He's got, like, plenty of ideas. He's always drawing, always sketching. He has a, um, memoir. It's so good. It's amazing. It makes me wanna cry, like, every time he talks about it. Could it be a movie? You know, is there sex? Is there deaf sex? Every great movie starts with a title. "Deaf Sex," automatic Oscar. Come on. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Pitch me. Hello! Guys! "It's based on my childhood, how the only toys I had to play with were my drawings, because my parents wanted to spend their money on booze and drugs, and how, as an adult, I suddenly see my childhood drawings come to life." I fucking love it. I am holding back tears. I want to buy it. I want to fucking buy it. He wants to buy it. Compose text. I'll pay you to write it. I'll pay you 50,000, 60,000. I get the rights to the screenplay. I mean, I get 50, 60K, that's low. That's, like, a month's rent. But how long does it take to write a screenplay, like, one or two weeks? I think you're really special, Michael. Make art... Make art with me. I want it. Fuck, yes, it did. Why didn't you just, like, say yes in there? Are you fucking serious? Look... I'm just trying to help you, okay? 'Cause you owe your publisher $30,000, remember? This affects me, too, now, okay? We're married now. You gotta be kidding me. Fine. I'm fine. This is good. Good morning. Good morning. This is your interpreter. No, I know. - Yes, hello. - She's coming. Hi. Hi. Okay, what... No, no. No. I don't... Nobody stands next to me. Oh, it's, uh, typically, the interpreter stands right behind the speaker so it's easier for me to look back and forth between the two of you. Oh, God, that's exhausting. Okay. Hey, you need to step over there, okay, and keep an arm's length distance. I don't like to feel other people's body heat, which makes intimacy quite challenging. Just ask my ex-husband. I'm kidding. He's dead. That's so funny. Oh, I love that kind of humor. Oh, are we already on the line? Yeah. We're on. Hi, guys. Oh, my God. Stella, you crack me up. Seriously, I'm not even kidding when I say you are the funniest woman I have ever met. Ha ha! What?! Can I actually have a nitro brew? Nancy, you in a coffee shop? I'm... How'd you guess? I'm a total caffeine addict. Sorry. I have to ask. Um, who's talking? I'm Kate Bailey. Yeah, it's Richard, Richard Broomsen. Yeah, it's Ben's agent. Hi, Kate. This is Nancy Farger. I'm leading the campaign for Welder. All right, shall we get to it? So I think for the whole signing thing, I gotta discuss that. Yes, and from our standpoint, we think... - Hello? - You guys still on? - Yes. - Uh, yes, yes. Uh, absolutely we feel that Ben should sign. I have a unique perspective on this as a deaf person. We have an incredible opportunity in this campaign... Yeah, yeah, we're gonna have to disagree with you. For us, it's gonna be a pass on the signing. It's a hard no. I love that you are passionate about something in your life. My mom, she has M.S. And, God, do I wish every commercial addressed that, but that's just not the world we live in. And there's just no benefit to a social justice angle on this one. It's a watch ad, not some march for lesbians. Completely, Richard. So I just wanna make sure that we're on the same page that we are good people, and we're not doing the signing in the ad. - Okay, great. - Exactly. We'll get together about the dates. Yes! Let's get a coffee. Let's grab a drink. Let's circle back. We could do it on the phone. Okay, thanks, guys. - Bye, love. - Okay. Well, you tried, Kate. Oh, boy. Lot of feelings. I learned German in 16 hours, no joke. Mom. Ah, Ryan. Ah, hi, lovey! Ooh! And Michael. Ah. Thank you. So... So, um... we have something to tell you. What's wrong? Oh, no. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, not today. Nope, nope, nope. Not today. Don't wanna hear it. Come on. Mom... I can't do this today. I mean, I can't believe that you're gonna make me tell you... that my friend has... cancer. Noreen? Yes, if you must know. Okay, Noreen's cancer has been in remission for six years. She's literally a Pilates teacher. She's your Pilates teacher. So ready? Oh, God, no! Jesus Christ, Mom, can you just pretend to be happy? I'll pretend. Oh, it would just be my pleasure. I'm so happy for you! Okay. Oscar, three martinis, please! Mm-hmm. Oh, so rude of me. Do you want something to drink? Hi! Hi. Hello. Some last-minute documents. Uh, why didn't you just send a messenger? I was in the neighborhood and wanted to say hi while also being great at my job. No ulterior motive here. Did I get that right? Yay! Gosh, so soft. Where's the bathroom? Thank you. Be back. Yeah. Okay. All right, your turn, sweetie. Okay. So what's new, besides marriage? Do you have a new book yet? Well, a memoir shouldn't take longer to write than it does to live. You know, I used to be exactly like you. I married a much wealthier man. I stopped acting. I said bye-bye to "Days of Our Lives," and I said hello to martinis and golf. But I like it. I do. I like it a lot. So you should learn how to play, and quickly. 'Cause you're me now. Michael. Your turn. Yeah, one swing. Yeah, one. - Oh, you're so cute. - Ohh. Oh, thanks. - Let's pop that collar. - Oh, good. I love that look on you. It's so cute. Yeah, clearly love a popped collar, Mom. I do. You know, sweetie, they do post-nups now. - Oh, my God. - They're retroactive, and at least you'd be protected. I mean, I'm just saying. - Mom. Mom. - I'm just saying. I love Michael. We literally just got married. What are you even talking about? Well, you can't charge a Tesla with love. Ah. I mean, my marriage sucked, and I just don't want yours to suck, too. Are you okay? Not really. - U.T.I. - Fuck. The worst. Lucky you. I'm just getting over mine, so... New guy? That's how I got mine. Yeah. Keep it. Sounds like you might need it more. Well, you, too, right? New guy. No. He's in Georgia. And ever since we had sex, I can't stop thinking about him. Girl. Just feel it, and then move on. And you know what? Fuck someone else if you feel like you want to fuck him, okay? You are a sexual human being. Own it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. - Yes! - Yeah. Yeah. Okay, we're starting again! Here we go! And action. This is your time. What the fuck is that woman doing? One second. And action! Just make sure we can cut this part out if we need to. Thank you so much. Sorry. Am I interrupting? Oh, no, no, no. No. I was gonna take off. Now? Yeah. Oh, shit! No, no, no! Don't! Don't! - Fuck! Oh! - Oh! Fuck. What the... Oh, is this fucking funny to you? I just redid the floors. It's like having fucking children. Fuck! No.
