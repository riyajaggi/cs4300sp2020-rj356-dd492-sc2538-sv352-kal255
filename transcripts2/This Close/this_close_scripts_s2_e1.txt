 Sir, can you hear me? Sir! Sir, do you know what's happening? He's deaf. Are you in pain? - He's deaf. - Ma'am, please back away. I'm just trying to tell her that he... Michael. What happened? Don't move your arm. It looks like it's the collarbone. Grab the stretcher! Are you his partner?

 - Yes, I'm his wife. - No. I'm his husband. That's not legal. Whatever you two are, only one of you can climb in. Kate, do you wanna go? Really? I mean, obviously you wanna go. Go ahead. You're his best friend. You've been inside him. I have not, so... Come on, people. Who's going? Me. I'm gonna have to check his hips. Tell him I'm cutting off his jeans. Kate! Hey, hey, Kate!

 Kate, hey, hey! Hey. Is... Is he okay? I don't know. I think so. Okay. Um... I love you. Hi. I'm looking for Michael Rosen. Sorry? Michael... Yeah. Uh, sorry. We're looking for our friend, Michael Rosen. Your friend is in room 208. Um, room 208. I know. I'm here for you. - Whoa. - No, don't look. I said don't look. I-I'm fine. That... That was one time. It was a lot more than one time. Um, I better go. Wait. Hey. Just let me come with you. I can help translate. Oh. Yeah. I-I wanna help. Well, I have an app, and I did the flashcard... No, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck. Oh, good. Is that for the pain? Oh, sorry. We have to wait 'til his blood alcohol level goes down before we could administer anything beyond fluids. Oh, he's deaf. Yeah. Well, we need to get some tests done, but we're pretty sure it's the collarbone. And that could mean surgery. Are you his legal partner? It's family only in the ICU and recovery, but, you know, I'm cool to give you a few minutes together. But Ricardo's on next, and he's a dick. Okay. Thank you. Can I say I told you so? Look, I know that I need to sign better. The... The app just wasn't enough, okay? I'll download another app. I'll download more apps. I'll do it right now. Oh, wait. Oh. Excuse me. Do you know the Wi-Fi password? I think you have a concussion. Nah, I don't... Oh, ma'am. Sorry. Uh, the password to the Wi-Fi? She's a doctor, so she's a little busy. Should just post it on the wall or something. Can you just please forget... forget the app? Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry I haven't been trying the way you want me to. I don't want to break up. I'm not sure I do either. It's just not... I need to check on Michael. No, no, no, no. Just stay here. I'll be back, okay? I promise. Dr. Forrest, dial 183. Dr. Forrest... No. I looked, but... Okay. No, no, no. He's... He's sleeping, so... Maybe just wait a little bit. Kate, you are not his family. Hey, Kate, why is it he got hit by a car and you didn't? Need me to pray for anybody? I got time. Thanks. What? Stop moving. Hou just lose someone? Sir, he was moved. He's not lost. Okay, but nobody can tell us where he is. I understand that, and I'm just waiting on my colleagues... - This is bullshit. - Okay. They don't know anything. Is there a note in his file that says he's deaf? And where is the interpreter? I've made all the appropriate calls, ma'am, so if you guys can just go have a seat over there. Why is this taking so fucking long? Because it costs double to get an interpreter at this time of the night, so they're probably waiting. Are you kidding me? If you don't get an interpreter here soon, I'm gonna have to call the ACLU. This is a violation of his civil rights. Do not threaten me, ma'am. Oh, it's not a threat. Take it off! Hey. Where were you? Sorry. Sorry. Uh, no, no, I... It's for, um... No, I'm kidding. Feel better. I'm... I'm gonna go home. He's too good for her anyway, so... It's after visiting hours. Family only. Time to go. Okay, go get yourself a cup of coffee. When you come back, we'll be family. Whatever, man. Hey, hey, wait. Wait. Hey, hey. Wait. Would you please... Would you please just wait? That is literally what I've been doing all night. I've been sitting downstairs, waiting for you for over an hour. And I know I'm blah or whatever, but... Look, I'm... I'm sorry I didn't come down earlier. No, you forgot me. We lost Michael, and I had to... Yes! Exactly, see? Kate, I'm done. Are you breaking up with me after I broke up with you? I can't keep coming in second to Michael. Are you for real making this about Michael? Yes! Look, I knew the two of you were close, but your friendship is fucking weird! What? It's weird. Like, weird. You understand that? Weird? It's not weird. Oh, yes, it is. It's the weirdest thing I've ever fucking seen, because you would do anything and everything for him at any time, and he would never do the same thing for you. That's not true. - You're wrong. - Yeah? Yeah? Okay, you call me when you realize I'm right. Call you? Wow. Fuck you. So fucking text me. Whatever. Ready or not. Are we ready to do this? Yep. Will you please tell Michael that I am honored to perform this ceremony and that I come to him full of openness and grace and love and all that stuff? Yes. Uh, he can lip-read you. Oh. Sorry. Then I'm sorry about that. Hope that was not completely offensive. Um, so we are gathered here to bring together Ryan and Michael. Do you guys have some... You have some love vows, maybe, you'd like to share, something? Oh, um... Uh, we can come up with something. Perfect. Maybe we just say whatever pops into our heads. - Okay? - That's good. - Okay? - I like it. Who's gonna shoot first? Um, me. I just... I keep thinking about your socks. Yeah. I kept finding your socks in, like, weird corners... for months after you left. And, um... and now I get to ask you for the rest of our lives, why can't you just throw them in the damn hamper? No, no, no, no! Don't... Don't do that! That... Save that. Save the kiss. Sorry. Didn't mean to yell. It's okay. Your turn. Great. Now by the power vested in me by woman and God, whose love knows no boundaries and whose patience is infinite, I now pronounce you husband and husband. We're married.
