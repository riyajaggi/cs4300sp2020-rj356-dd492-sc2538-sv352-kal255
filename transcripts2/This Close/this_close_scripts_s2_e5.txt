 Shep. Shit. So I feel like these will probably fit. Uh, getting tased and pissing my pants is enough humiliation for one day. Okay, so no? So... You invited me to visit. Yeah... years ago. The eggs in L.A. are really good.

 Why are you here? Well, there's something I want to say. I've been practicing. I can't believe you did that. Hey, I've been messed up since you left Georgia. Everything just feels wrong. I've been thinking maybe we could make this work. I don't know. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm... I have to go to work. Yeah. But it's like this. For me, decisions are like poop. I can't poop at will.

 I poop when I poop. Yeah, exactly. I poop when I poop. Right. Okay, good. I'll text you. Hey. Announcer: This is your time. Stella: I'm gonna have to watch it again. I don't see anything wrong. This is your time. Why is there no signing in this? Well, that's what we agreed to on the conference call. Am I going crazy? It was a whole thing. No, I talked with Ben. He agreed to sign. Okay. Did you ask anybody? No, I... Initiative. I took initiative. So you went rogue. What were you thinking? I was thinking about representation. Oh, yes, okay, great. Representation is great. We love representation. We also love keeping our clients happy. Look, you are paid to do your job, so do your job. Okay? Help his career. Make him money. Make people want to work with him again. Understood? Understood. Do you really understand what I'm saying? Yes, I understand. Okay. Great. So why don't you take the rest of the day off? Thank you. This is your time. I have to go. Shit. This is the frog of truth. Only the person who has the frog of truth can talk. The other person has to listen, because listening is much more important than hearing. So who wants to... Okay. Here we go. Um... this was supposed to be a new beginning for us, but I feel shame whenever I try to fix things. Epp, epp, epp, epp, epp. You don't have the frog. Gotta... Yeah, please. I just don't understand, like, what it is you do all day. Oh, really? I'm trying to use my money to fucking help keep you creative. I'm helping the creative process. I just do. I don't... I don't... That's such an unfair question. Okay, look. The root of the issue, it seems to me, is not language. It's communication. You don't really need a frog to be honest with each other. I mean, although other couples that, you know, use it, it's been very helpful in the past, but that's... that's fine. Um, I want each of you to give each other a direct action. Okay? Okay. I... Do I have to use the frog? It's fine. Go ahead. I want you to try, okay? Just really try with Tack. Look, I made this happen with him. It's important to me, so please, please, can we just... Make a meeting for this afternoon. That's beautiful. I mean, you just gave me an idea for the name of my next book. "Love Transcends Language." Thanks, dude. My God, you're the one who made us turn on location sharing, remember? I told you this morning that you didn't have to, but instead, you decided to just lie and waste my time. You are such a fucking disappointment. I should go.
