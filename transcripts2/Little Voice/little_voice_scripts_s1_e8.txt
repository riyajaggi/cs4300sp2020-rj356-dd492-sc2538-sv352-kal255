 I'll call you later. Okay. Okay. And we were jubilant Willing to pretend We were not losing time Time wasted He's a great dad when he's sober. I haven't seen him like this in, like, a decade. I stupidly thought this part of my life was over. He did it once. He'll find his way back. The louder I call, the faster it runs The louder I call, the faster it runs

 The quiet is ours The work has begun The louder I call, the faster it runs I search for patterns Sense that isn't there If you guys have anywhere that you see him, could you please let me know, okay? Take care. I've been letting him help me with rent. God, what is wrong with me? Bess, he's the parent. It's okay for a parent to help their kid with rent. I should've seen this coming. I should've been paying more attention. Stop it. Stop blaming yourself. You pay attention more than any daughter I know. You've been through this before. Do you remember? In eighth grade, when he was gone for, like, over a month? Samuel's right. He'll make his way back. And we're supposed to take Louie to a fucking Broadway show today. We can call the police. No. Might be drugs. Well, then we just have to wait it out. Please, don't tell anybody. Don't tell your family. - Your mom. She'll... - Course not. This is all my fault. Okay, not everything is in your control. Trust me. I would prefer that world, but it's not the one we live in. Elaine said I could have this balloon for my birthday redo. That's nice of Elaine. Yeah. Elaine is nice after coffee. Where's Dad? He really wanted to be here, but he got a gig. But this is my birthday. It's my birthday, take two. Dad wouldn't miss this. It's the revival of My Fair Lady. We're not gonna be able to go today, buddy. I'm sorry. But this is supposed to be my actual birthday present. I know, but Dad had the tickets. He didn't give 'em to you? Well, his gig was upstate last minute, and he couldn't get the tickets to me in time. He feels terrible. I feel terrible. Well, we'll just have to rain check our take two. This is the rain check. It would have to be take three. As soon as Dad comes back, we'll all go see it together. I promise. Why don't we watch some TV? There's no TV during the daytime. That's your rule. Well, there's a Golden Girls marathon on. Rule breaker. It's Dad! I knew he wouldn't miss it. Mom. Hello, Louis. Hi, Mom. My baby. How did you find us? I heard Louie announce where he lived on his vlog. "This is Louie King from the Schaller House in Murray Hill." And before I knew it, I was heading to the airport and getting on a plane. - So, after all the... - You watch my vlog? Of course I do. I never stopped keeping track of you. Both of you. Have you seen all of them? Every single one. Why didn't you leave a comment? Comments are very helpful with attracting Internet followers. I wanted to surprise you. Well, you did. You surprised us. Hey, Louie, not now. Turn that off. Louie. You said we could watch The Golden Girls marathon. - The next episode starts in two minutes. - I know, but now we have a guest. Louie, I said turn it off. It's okay. It's okay. You go ahead and watch, baby. Bess, I saw your video. Your music is beautiful. I'm late for work. Where you working? I have a job, and Louie has a doctor's appointment. - I don't have a doctor's appointment. - Yes, you do, Louie. I understand. I didn't mean to disrupt your schedule. We don't have a schedule. We were supposed to be on our way to see My Fair Lady, but Dad got a gig upstate, so right now we can stay here and watch The Golden Girls marathon on TV. Louie, we have to go. But Blanche has a new suitor, and Rose is fighting with Dorothy to keep a stray dog. We love stray dogs. Okay, you can watch the theme song, but then we're leaving. I know this must seem sudden. Maybe we can all get together a little later? Why don't you and I meet later? Just the two of us. I would love that. Thank you. How about our old favorite, Cup & Saucer? It doesn't exist anymore. - This isn't a doctor's appointment. - Look around. There's doctors everywhere. How are you today, Mrs. Finch? I wanna introduce you to my brother, Louie. Louie, this is Mrs. Daisy Finch. She didn't say hello. I don't know if she wants to talk to me. No, she loves company. She hears everything you say. She could be a Golden Girl. Louie, she was a chorus girl in the movies. Oh, my goodness. Is that her? She had a minor dancing role in Breakfast at Tiffany's with Audrey Hepburn. - Wow. - She's a star. Mrs. Finch, you're a star! You know, I really think we should get this anniversary party started. - Happy anniversary. Congratulations. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - You know, Mr. Mantone's doctor's been playing music for him from his younger days, and he's been getting some response. Why would he respond to that and not his wife's voice? Well, they say that music is stored in a different area of the brain than language. It's working. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sal loves Frank Sinatra. Do you know any Frank Sinatra? That deserves a special song. This one is for you, Sal. Yes. Some day, when I'm awfully low And the world is cold I will feel the glow Just thinking of you And the way you look tonight Oh, but you're lovely Never, never change Keep that breathless charm - Won't you please arrange it? - Ella. Ella! 'Cause I love you Ella, come. Just the way you look tonight Just the way you look tonight Bless what you have bestowed. Oh, give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good. His love endureth forever. Amen. I'm so happy we're doing this. How are things going for you? Great. Your music? All good. Making progress. Well, that's good. It's... It's a hard life, the music business. Yeah, well, it's what I love, so... I'm glad you found something you love. Here you go. Two turkey clubs. Could we please have... - a side of extra avocado? - Side of avocado? She loves avocado. Avocado. Got it. Bess... I need you to know I didn't plan on staying away so long. The longer I stayed away, the more I felt like I couldn't come back. And I'm sure that doesn't make any sense to you, but I was so young... and I had to... grow up myself. And I know that's not an excuse. So, why now? Why are you here? At my darkest time, I've... I found God. He gave me the strength to heal. And I'm here because I have finally forgiven myself. Well, at least someone has. Honey, I don't know if you remember how things really were back then. It wasn't easy living with your dad. He's not like that anymore. People don't change, Bess. You just said you did. I've healed. There's a difference. Is there? You know, I think we need some time. So, how long do you plan on staying? As long as it takes. So, when you rehearsed that with your pastor, what was my line after that? James, back to you. Mercury, 1,000. Queen's front man, Freddie Mercury, was born on this island of Tanzania. Zanzibar. He was born Farrokh Bulsara to Indian parents. You have to go on the show. Exactly. I mean, she's beating the returning champ. Super fantastic. Where is my third daughter? Bess. - She loves it when I win. - Where is Bess? She has her hands full. Full of what? Work. - Okay. - I need some air. I... - Oh, you want to... Okay. Yeah, no problem. - Yeah. You okay? Bess isn't. Anything I can do? Nothing anybody can do, but you're a good guy. So... I actually need to say something. It's important. I... I... There's no right way to say this, but... I can't keep seeing you. Well, that took a turn. I'm in love with someone else. I'm so sorry. I don't wanna lead you on anymore. Wow. Well... I'm in love with someone else too, if that helps. What? Yep. But I'm so great. Yeah, you are. So are you. I wish I was in love with you. You're so cool. You too. I'm in love with this other person, and it's... ruining my life. Are you gay? - No. - Sorry. No, she's just... She's not Indian. She's... She's Chinese. And, you know, my parents would lose it. Yeah. Yeah, I get it. I'm... Here it is, I guess. I'm gay. That feels so nice to say. Good. It should. Wow. Okay, I have a crazy idea. Yeah? What do you say we keep this thing going for them? Just to buy us some time? Wait, no. You mean like pretend we're together? Yep. I'm in. Great. I do. Okay, I do too. - Okay. - Okay. - Good idea. - Yeah. - I think they're happy. - Yeah. Sometimes I feel like quitting Make someone do my bidding You're laughing, but I'm not kidding I feel like I'm gonna lose it God knows I didn't choose it It's for the band. Right when I wasn't looking Trouble found me They're all sober. Right, I meant table five. Well, there's nobody at table five. Looks like you could use it. - All good. - You okay? - All good. - Yeah, you said that. What's so good? I don't wanna talk about it. Look. I'm here. So am I. Trouble finds me Ooh, trouble - Trouble finds me - Ooh, trouble Trouble finds me So, I have good news. Oh, yeah? You know that guy that my parents are trying to set me up with? Yeah. He doesn't wanna do this either. He's seeing someone else too. So, we made a deal. We'll pretend to date while you and I keep seeing each other. So, you wanna keep me hidden? Well... Okay, okay, not in those words. Well, what words would you use? - You want to lie. - I have to. No, you don't. There's a song in my head Oh, a line that never stops playing I'm not sure how it ends I can't remember when I heard What you were saying Yo. Two Buds and a Stella. So, I met an A&R; guy who wants to hear you play, and I am telling you, this is the guy. This is the guy. No. He works for a small indie label. It's perfect for you. I'm not doing it. All the other people that we saw were idiots. They didn't know anything. Well, if four out of five dentists agree... Please. Elvis was told that he was better off driving trucks. The Beatles were rejected by Decca Records. So, here is the plan. Al is having an orphans' Thanksgiving open mic night thing here in a few weeks, and I think that you should do it. You should get your confidence back up before you play for this guy. Benny. Stop. Please stop. No way. We gotta make this happen. For me or for you? For you. I'm telling you I wanna quit. This is what managers do. They talk you off the cliff. Get real. There's nothing to manage. I can't do this anymore. Yes, you can. We are in this together. Benny! Let it go. You gotta get your own life, because I can't be responsible for one more person. There's not much that I can protect So I keep my good humor alive Well, nothing disturbs your intellect Like feeling something you can't deny Justified Well, I don't want to be lost So, all's good? Come here. Come here. I want to see these walls Crumble and dissolve around me Look. Benny told me what's going on with your old man. - He shouldn't have done that. - Well, so let me be your dad for a minute. Now, for the first time in his life, Benny's right. I know you're in the tunnel, but don't just throw yourself away. A whiskey rocks, please. Gotta get to work, boss. Heard mom and dad talking money again Fit a seven-person family... Hey. What are you doing here? I needed to see you. - Didn't you move away? - No, I want to explain. Well, I'm working. I ended it with Laila, and I needed the money to move out. I can still hear that song In my head But, Bess, I'm ready to... Bess. - I can't do this right now. - Bess. Bess. So, I'm supposed to trust you again because you're ready now? It took time. It wasn't that simple, but I'm here. You can't just choose her yesterday and then choose me today. I'm not a fucking item on a menu. - You know I don't see you that way. - Everyone in my life does. - Don't push this away. - I didn't. You did. Well, I am here now. - And I'm not going anywhere. - I don't believe you. It was so easy for you to protect her feelings this whole time and not mine. It was just easier to hurt me. Bess. Go. Go! I don't want you thinking I'm unhappy What is closer to the truth That if I lived till I was 00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:56,710 I just don't think I'll ever Get over you Your face, it dances And it haunts me Laughter still ringin' In my ears I still find pieces Of your presence here Even Even after all these years And even though I may seem To feel a touch of love I just don't think I'll ever Get over you I just don't think I'll ever Get over you I drink good coffee Every morning Comes from a place That's far away And when I'm done I feel like talking Without you here There is less to say And if I lived till I was 00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:33,742 I just don't think I'll ever Get over you
