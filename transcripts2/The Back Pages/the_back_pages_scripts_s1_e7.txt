 Charlie. Charlie. What's up, man? Dude, where are you going? Anywhere, but here. What about the Johnson account? I'm already finished. You're finished? How? Wikipedia. Seriously, man? You're gonna get fired.

 We can't afford to miss rent again. Fired. Dude, this place has mandatory yoga classes and a climbing wall in the lunch room. Nobody's getting fired here, Finch. Ever. Still, it's wrong. Why should I put in the effort where the work has already been done? No, I'm gonna go to the lake. You wanna come? No thanks. I'm gonna do my work and not get fired. Suit yourself.

 Whatever. Hey, cut that out! Is she dead? No. No, she's not. Hey! Hey, beat it! Get out of here before I tell your parents. Hey, what's going on there? Hey, is she okay? Huh? I'm gonna call somebody. No, stop. What I mean to say is she's fine. I'm fine, thank you. She just went a little heavy on the hooch. I'm gonna take her home now. Are you sure you don't me to call somebody? Hey, you don't look very good yourself, you know. Yeah, I'm fine. All right. Whatever. Just minding my own business here. Hurry up, Finch, my hands are full! Okay, okay. Coming. Dude! What the hell, man? What did you do to that girl? Nothing. No, no, no, no, no. Get her out of here, man. I've let too many things slide with you before. Not this time, no. Fine, that's fine. Go ahead and ignore me. I'm calling the cops. No, no, look, look, I found her on the beach alone and unconscious. I'm just trying to help her. Then call the police. Finch, we don't know anything about her. Who knows what kind of trouble she could be in? Until she wakes up, and we know more, she stays here. Exactly. Now, go get her some clothes. Seriously? My old jersey? Everything else looked dirty. Give me it. Don't just stand there. Give me a hand. She's so beautiful. Yeah, and a complete mystery. This is not good, man. What if she's on the run from the mob, a rogue agent, or worse, an alien replicant? Dude, you watch too many movies. We need to take her down to the police station. Hey, what about that facial recognition software that Emily's working on for the Alvarez account? Right. I'm sure she'd help you discover the identity of your latest girlfriend. Shut up, man. Seriously, if you get a picture of her and send it to Emily, the software will search the web for a similar image. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tinder. She's gotta be out there. I doubt she's on Tinder. I definitely would've noticed. Oh my God. Finch, go make yourself useful, man. Take a picture of her and send it to Emily. Charlie! What happened? What do you mean what happened? She woke up! What do we do, man? It's okay. It's all right. You're safe here. We don't wanna hurt you. We want to help you. I think she wants a drink. Go, go. It's all right. We wanna help you. We're not gonna hurt you. Water, you idiot! Right. Sorry. We wanna help you, okay? What is she doing, man? Hell if I know. My fish! Stop it. It'll be okay. Do you have a name? A name. Do you have a name? Cut it out. She obviously can't talk. Hey, you. Yeah, you. What is your name? Cut it out, Finch! Why don't you cut it out, man? Cut what out? Doing stupid crap like this. Who finds a woman not only unconscious, but also naked and doesn't call the cops? I was just trying to help her. Cut the crap, man. You're more interested in helping yourself to her. I'm calling the cops right now. I don't care if I get into any trouble. I'm done with this. Put the phone down, Finch. Put the phone down now. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna come over there. I'm gonna kick your ass. Where's Finch? Finch, Finch! My phone! Where's my phone? It's on the table, man. What happened last night, dude? I don't know, man. The last thing I remember is we were about to fight, and dammit, she's still here. I could've sworn it was a nightmare. She's gotta go, man. She could've killed us both. No, no, look, look. She's innocent. Look at her. She's harmless. Besides, I think she stopped us from fighting. I don't know, man. It's fine. See? If she really wanted to kill us by now, don't you think she would've done it already? Did we have fish in the fridge? Look, look. Let's just give Emily a chance to find out who she is. If she doesn't come up with anything, then we'll call the cops. This isn't right, man. What if she's a rich heiress? Or a missing person with a large reward? Would you really wanna risk giving that kind of money away? Who's to say she won't rob us when we're gone today? What's she gonna steal? Your old, broken TV and my jersey? No, the worst that could happen is while we're at the office, she leaves, and you get what you wanted. She'll be gone. Just today, and then she's gone. Yeah, of course, of course. All right, so just stay here. We'll be back in a few hours, but stay here. Let's go. Yeah, the sooner, the better. I think he knows I'm onto him. Okay. Thank you. Hey, man. Has Emily gotten back to you with the results yet? Yeah, she said to go by her cubicle. Nice, let's go. I got a couple things to do. I'll be there in a second. Okay. Suit yourself. Sorry, no more booty calls, Charlie. Go bother someone else. Actually, I was working on a project with Finch. You were running a query for him? Oh, I see. Still using Finch to accomplish your dirty work. It's not like that. Why should I do anything for you? It's for work. I'm sure it is. Emily, did the search pull anything up? I'm sorry to disappoint you, but your new lady friend doesn't exist. What? Well not exactly. You'll see. These are all just paintings, old paintings and stupid drawings. Every single one. No Facebook pics, no Instagram uploads, just paintings and drawings. Looks to me like she went off the grid to escape you. Finch has gotta see this. Finch? He already saw these. What? I showed him about 20 minutes ago. You're welcome... jerk. Charlie, a word, please. I can't right now, I'm in a hurry. We just have a few questions for you. Let's not cause a scene. Do I have to? You don't have to do anything, Charlie. It's your choice. Just be prepared to live with the consequences of your choice. Will you step into the conference room? It'll just take a few minutes. Hello? Lady, are you here? That's close enough. No, this is ridiculous. I'm not cooking meth behind the employee yoga studio. Unless I'm being legally detained, I'm leaving. His desk is clean. There! Now, can I please go? So you're sure there's nothing you wanna tell us? Charlie, the more you tell us now, the better off it'll be for you in the long run. There's nothing to tell. Fine, you're free to go. Finally. Hello? Finch? What the hell, Finch? No, no! She's not what she seems, man. She's a monster. You gotta trust me! Enough with this crap! What did you do to her? You don't get it, you don't get it, man. She's a beast, some sort of a monster. Stop! I'm not the bad guy here. She is. Trust me, Charlie, please. Put the gun down, Finch. No, you don't get it. She'll kill us both if we give her the chance. No! Finch? Finch? Finch, Finch. Finch. Finch. Finch. No!
