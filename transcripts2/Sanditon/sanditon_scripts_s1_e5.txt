 HUBBUB Morning, miss. Georgiana. Mrs Griffiths. Miss Heywood. Charlotte. What a lovely surprise. I've brought you that book that we were discussing. Oh! That book. I shall devour it with interest. And what is the title of this opus? Self-Control... by Mary Brunton.

 Oh, it's educational. I'd be more than happy to sit and read it with her for a short while. If you have something else you need to do. No, perfectly happy. Thank you. The truth is, Mrs Griffiths, I'm rather self-conscious when it comes to reading. Please do not be offended if I confess I'd prefer to do it with Charlotte, alone. On account of my shyness. I shall be just outside. THEY GIGGLE LOUDLY: "Chapter One. "All was yet dark and still."

 My darling Otis says he wants to see me. Nay, he MUST see me, or he shall die from the wanting. WHISPERS: I'm sure talk of his death is somewhat premature. "When Laura..." WHISPERS: We cannot take that risk. We must think of a plan. It's not going to be easy, given you're practically under house arrest. It's outrageous! I only want to see him for a brief hour. Or two. RAISED VOICE: Why is that so wrong? Shh! WHISPERS: We'll think of something. Do not despair. NORMALLY: Now you, Miss Lambe. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH I was wondering when you were finally going to leave your bedroom. Are you unwell? Lady Denham. I was passing, so... ..I thought I'd do you the honour of taking tea with me. Oh, how thoughtful. We'd be delighted, wouldn't we, Esther? Of course you would. So, Esther... ..I'll come straight to the point. What news of Lord Babington? None, Aunt. Sorry to disappoint. Good thing he's been sharing plenty of news with me, then. You? How? I have written to him. On your behalf. To what end? To assure him that you are delighted at his attentiveness. It seems I must take matters into my own hands. I wish you hadn't have done that. Now I'll appear rude. Rather late to worry about appearances, Esther. Make yourself presentable. And then, you will write to Lord Babington immediately, to tell him how much you are looking forward to seeing him at the cricket match on Thursday. As I have agreed. How long will it be? It has been weeks, sir... Patience, patience. I-I-I beg you. All in good time! You'll get every penny you are due. You have my word. We've been patient for weeks now, Mr Parker. No sign of the men, or equipment you've been promising. Men here have mouths to feed. You're a father. You must understand. All I ask is a little more time. Give us a date, Mr Parker. Then we all know where we stand, and we can get on with the work. Miss Heywood... Mr Parker, Mr Stringer, Mr Robinson. Miss Heywood. How splendid to, er, happen upon you like this. Yes, erm... Yes, I-I was sent on a mission by my dear wife, with the absolute instruction to fetch you to the river. Come along, my dear. Good day, then, Mr Stringer. Nice to see you again, Miss Heywood. I didn't know that you and Miss Heywood were friendly, James. We've had the odd interesting conversation... about architecture. She's very knowledgeable, you know. Architecture, eh...? That woman is quite intolerable. Well, it's too bad, you'll just have to grin and bear her ridiculous match-making. I'm glad you're amused. Oh, humour her. Don't worry, it won't come to anything, and you could have some fun at Lord Poppycock's expense. Why do you think it won't come to anything? Because you can't stand him. He's a buffoon. I think I've been unfair to him. Unfair? He deserves all of your contempt and more. Does he? I could do far worse. And if I must marry, why not marry a lord? I think we know the answer to that. You said yourself I have to consider marriage, did you not? Did I? Yes, Edward, you did. Perhaps our interfering aunt has done us both a favour. Henry. Henry. Go and get it. Come and see. This game is teetering on a knife edge. I can hardly breathe, watching it. You're on my team, Tom. I'm afraid you've drawn the short straw. Good practice for Thursday, my dear. Charlotte. Careful, dear Arthur, you must preserve yourself for the match itself. Match? The annual cricket match. The gentlemen play the workers. Everyone'll be there. Everyone? Oh, yes, everyone. No-one'll miss it. Will they, Tom? Certainly not. It's a perfect opportunity for everyone to come together. If you'll excuse me, I've just remembered something I really must attend to. But you've only just arrived... I won't be long. OTIS' VOICE: "Every day apart from you, I'm grow in sadness. "And I know that my spirit, my whole self is not the same, "when I'm not with you." Charlotte... how did you get past the gorgon? Shh... she's only in the next room! Will I never be free of her? Do not despair, because I have a plan. "My beloved Otis. "I would be most delighted to meet with you. "Shall we say four o'clock? "This Thursday coming. Outside the hotel. "Yours in anticipation, and love, Georgiana." This must be the least enticing hostelry that I've ever had the good pleasure to get blind drunk in. Your round, Parker. No, I think I need to go and see Tom. All right. We'll see you at the match. Right. Sidney! I knew you wouldn't let me down. Good news, I hope? I'm afraid the situation is unchanged, Tom. I'm sorry. Yes. Well, at least I have your prowess on the cricket field to be grateful for. Well, in truth, you have Lord Babington to thank for that. I'm here at his behest. To give him moral support in his time of romantic need. God knows, he'll need it. You're a good friend, Sidney. I don't suppose you could try just one last time, I... Tom, please stop. I can't be drawn on the situation any longer. Mr Parker. Miss Heywood. My dear. Now, I must get back to the terrace. If the men are to have the afternoon off, I should ensure they complete certain tasks beforehand. Mary will be delighted to see you, Sidney. Delighted. Hodges. I assume you're here for the cricket, Mr Parker. Never short of assumptions, Miss Heywood. Well, I was not expecting to see you back so soon. Believe me, neither was I. Sidney, what a lovely surprise. Mary. Have you seen Tom? Yes, I, er... just I caught him on his way out. But if you'll excuse me, I must go and see Mrs Griffiths. Good day. I'm so thrilled he could make it. The men are angry, Mr Parker, for good reason. That's as may be, but I need you to do your job now and pacify them. They're talking about refusing to play in the cricket, to show how unhappy they are. They can't! If they... if they do that, the whole town will know. That's what they're banking on, sir. Very well. Tell them I'll pay them in a fortnight. No later. Tell them. You can't break any more promises, Mr Parker. We won't stand for it. I'll find the money. I'll do my job, so you do yours and tell them thus from me. Two weeks. Not a day longer. They have my word. Come now, it's not that bad. I intend to indulge in a spot of light flirtation. In here? Not here. But here, if you get my drift. Oh. Not Miss Denham, please. I'm becoming quite exhausted at the mention of her name. You're uncommonly smitten with that women. Heaven knows why. Though she's clever, I grant you. She knows it's the chase that keeps you dangling. Well, you could not be more wrong, Crowe. Miss Denham does not waste time with... petty games. She is entirely herself at every turn. She has finally answered my letters. And the response is... short and lacking in any courtesy whatsoever. I have taken great heart from it. Oh, good grief, man. You are lost. And I'm rather enjoying it. Mrs Griffiths. Where is Georgiana? I trust she hasn't slipped your net again? No, no, no, Mr Parker, rest assured. I have been assiduous in my vigilance since that last unfortunate episode. She is with the Beaufort girls, she's quite safe. I trust you'll be as watchful in the future, please. Now, the responsibility for Miss Lambe's welfare will rest entirely with you from now on. Do you understand? Oh. I see. Will you be travelling abroad again, Mr Parker? In the first instance, I'll be at Lord Babington's country estate. After that... I don't know. But what I do know is I will not be returning to Sanditon for the rest of the summer. Accordingly, I've settled Miss Lambe's accounts, in full, for the entire duration. HE CLEARS THROAT What are you doing here? Georgiana! Seeing as you ask so politely, I'm here to play cricket. Oh, Mr Parker! That will make it even more exciting to watch. The young ladies have asked to attend, Mr Parker. Presumably, you mean to forbid me from attending? And what makes you think that? Because you keep me locked up, like a criminal, when my only crime is love. Georgiana, as long as you do exactly as Mrs Griffiths instructs, you can do what you like. Am I meant to thank you for that contradiction? If Mrs Griffiths is happy to bring you to the cricket, then so be it. The sea air might even restore your good humour. Good day. THEY SQUEAL Charlotte, my dear. Yes. You've been guarding that plate for the past five minutes. You can put it down. The sandwiches will be quite safe here. Forgive me. It's, it's all so exciting. Do help yourself, Mr Parker. Oh, oh. HE CHUCKLES We shall set ourselves up... there, by the dunes. We won't see anything from there. Miss Lambe, Miss Beaufort, Miss Beaufort. Mrs Griffiths. Miss Heywood. My despicable guardian is here, and is going to ruin everything. No, he's not. We do exactly what we agreed. Once the game starts, everyone will be distracted, anyway. Listen for the church bells at a quarter to four, and you I will sneak off. What a lot of whispering. We were just discussing the next part of our book. I really must read this book. Ladies. ALL: Reverend. Mr Hankins. Are you looking forward to the match, Reverend? Oh, yes, indeed. I am to be an umpire. Very impressive, Mr Hankins. Are you partial to a ball game, Mrs Griffiths? Some. THEY GIGGLE Come along, ladies, let us settle. Until later... Good day, Miss Lambe. Ah! Excellent, you're all here. We are, but the opposition aren't. Is it off, then? No. No, of course not. Oh, that's a relief. I wouldn't like to think I've done all that exercise for nothing. BELL TOLLS It's two o'clock. Tom. They're late. Probably just, er, delayed at the site. Right, here I am. Willing and able. Where do you want me? Are you drunk? No more than usual. Here. You take this, I can't be expected to carry everything. Lady Denham, how splendid. Splendid. Over here is a particularly pleasing spot from which you shall see everything. Well, I'm glad it's got something to recommend it. Why the delay, my dear? If it goes on much longer, we'll run out of sandwiches. Don't worry, my dear. We'll be up and running shortly. HE CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY He's coming. Sit straight. Smile. No, don't smile. You'll confuse him. Lord Babington. Delighted, I'm sure. Likewise Lady Denham. Miss Brereton. Miss Denham. I'm pleased to see you here today. I had no idea you were such a cricket enthusiast. I'm not. She jests, Lord Babington. Sadly, she lacks my wit. And I thank you so much for your letter. I was... I was delighted to finally hear from you. Esther was delighted to oblige. Weren't you, Esther? Yes. Delighted. That makes three of us, then. She's positively mirthless. On the contrary, she's the wittiest woman I've have ever met. Then you are moving in the wrong circles. My fan, Clara. Yes, Aunt. Of course. Here it is. I'm glad someone considers my welfare. A little charm goes a long way, Esther. At this stage in the courtship, at least, you'll need to make more of an effort. Lord Babington! I imagined you to favour a rather different kind of man. Perhaps you should be wary of where your imagination leads. Excuse me. Well, sorry, Tom. It looks like the other side have let you down. There's no point in wasting the entire afternoon. Back to the bar. From one gentleman's pursuit to another. Here we are. I knew they'd be here. I don't wish to alarm, but they look rather good. APPLAUSE Good luck, Captain Parker. Thank you, Captain Stringer. Will there be a prize for the winner, Mr Parker? Glory. Not money, then? Didn't think so. Gentlemen. Heads. Tails. It's heads. We'll bat first. Very good, Mr Stringer. Good luck. APPLAUSE Miss Denham! The opposition have come prepared. At least one team has. Good luck, Mr Stringer. Not that you'll need it. Thank you, Miss Heywood. You seem to have gathered several admirers already. I hope you're among them. Ask me again, once I've seen you play. Good luck to you too, Mr Parker, although I imagine you don't think you'll need it. HE CHUCKLES Yet more assumptions, Miss Heywood. Sidney bowling first. APPLAUSE Come on, Stringer! Come on, chaps. Play on, gentlemen. Bowl him good, Sidney. Come on, Sanditon. CHEERING Catch it! Come on, back to me. Come on, Sydney. CHEERING Come on. Charge again! One more. Babington! Right, boys, come on. Well done! You picked a good spot. You've hardly touched the ball. Anyone would think I chose it for a reason. Did you? You know I did. BELL TOLLS Yes, another single. APPLAUSE Quick one. Very good. Ha-ha. Well done, Sidney. HE SIGHS Well bowled, Sidney. Unlucky. This was entirely my aunt's idea. Not mine. She does seem to be taking a great interest in our activities. She takes a great interest in everyone's activities. HE LAUGHS Babbers, are you playing? Your friend Crowe doesn't care much for me. He's a strutting peacock. You're two of a kind. Is that really all you think of me? You've yet to convince me otherwise. Then perhaps I could invite you on a short ride later. Give me the opportunity to prove you wrong. CHEERING Babington! Your ball, Lord Babington. Babbers, your ball! Thank you, Miss Denham. Come on, Babington. Babington! APPLAUSE Come along, gents. Out! Well done, Edward. All out for 86. Change of innings! Well done, gentlemen. Good show. This really is one of the most exciting cricket games I have ever seen! I sincerely doubt it. Did you see that? Young Mr Stringer is the most accomplished bowler. He has taken a great many wickets already. I pity anyone who has to face him. I know. I can hardly bear to look! Why don't you move a little closer? BOTH: Oh, please. No. I mean, we're perfectly fine where we are. I will just say, though, Reverend Hankins is one of the most formidable umpires I have ever seen. APPLAUSE Come on, gents. Jolly good shot! SHE SIGHS Is everything all right? No, it's not. I cannot get cool, and my, my throat is parched. I'll fetch another cordial. Howzat! CHEERING HANKINS: Out! CHEERING HE GASPS Ha-ha! Run! Run! Keeper's end. CHEERING Well played. I'm gonna get him. Right, one more wicket. One more wicket. He sees him celebrating. Does he know? HE LAUGHS Well played, Arthur. Let's play. APPLAUSE STRINGER GRUNTS, CROWD GASP Gosh, that was close, wasn't it?! Phew! Come on, Tom. Next time. Come on, Thomas. Come on, Tom. Bowl him, Stringer. CHEERING Leg before wicket! It's leg before wicket! No. I'm sorry, I don't think it was. You're out. Now listen, I really don't think I am. His leg stopped the ball from hitting the stumps, he's got to be out. Umpire? Out! THEY CHEER Now, come along. Fair's fair, be reasonable. The ball was nowhere near the wicket. Oh, I might have known you'd try and cheat. Your sort always do. No thought for anyone but yourself. Don't you dare talk to my brother like that. Why shouldn't he? We haven't been paid a penny in weeks. Now I'm sorry, I, I must confess, in the heat of the moment, I made a mistake. Not out. Tom... Tom... You can't leave like this, the game hasn't finished yet. It is finished, Sidney. Where are you going? Come on, come back to the game. What do you care? Mary. STRINGER: You haven't got another player to replace him. We win. That's right. I'll play. Ah, but isn't this a gentleman's pursuit? Women play cricket in Willingden, Reverend. Willingden sounds infinitely more lively than Sanditon. LAUGHTER You heard the umpire. He was wrong. My brother wasn't out. We play on. Play on. APPLAUSE Why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? That you couldn't afford to pay the men. Because it was a temporary situation, and the men knew that. The regatta will sort it out. You're making too much of it, Mary. It was hot out there. Tempers got frayed. That's all. Stop lying to yourself, Tom, and stop lying to me! You couldn't find the money to pay your men, yet you can give me this. I could bear anything, anything, if you had confided in me. Mary... Don't. Mary, please... ..you, the children, you are my life. I will repair this. You have my solemn word. I will go straight to London now. I'll make amends, if it is the last thing I do. Not more promises, Tom. All you ever do is break them. Keep your eye on the ball, all right? Thank you. I know what I'm doing. If you can't make the run, just stay put. Yes, thank you. I know exactly what I'm doing. Now please. I'm concentrating, and you're putting me off. All right. Let's play! APPLAUSE Yes! MAN: Yes! Go on, Miss Heywood. Go on! Run! This is too much excitement for one day. INDISTINCT All by yourself, Edward? I would offer myself as company, but your aunt sent me to tell you she's retiring for the day. What's that to me? Shall I tell her that? Please. Your aunt seems delighted by the prospect of Esther's growing liaison with Lord Babington. With clever Esther safely married off and in the lap of luxury, that just leaves you... ..and me. And your aunt's money. I wonder which of us will triumph? Actually... I don't. CHEERING He's wonderful, isn't he? Miss Lambe?! Where is that silly girl? BELL TOLLS It's very beautiful here. I thought your heart lay in London, Lord Babington. Are you suggesting a change in affection? I think that's exactly what I'm suggesting. And, believe me, no-one is more surprised than I. What are your feelings, Miss Denham? About what? The sky? The water? The company? All of that. It's growing on me. Though I wouldn't want to be in agreement with you too much, too soon. No-no-no-no. Whatever you do, you must guard against that. The humiliation. You have your reputation to consider. And you yours. Though I'm sure yours is beyond redemption. I think you'd be surprised. I'm not such a good-for-nothing as I would like. I am starting to think my life has been something of a pretence. I doubt there are many among us who can say that they've lived a life free from pretence. Well, then, surely, if we're to lead a better life... ..we're honour bound to free ourselves from such a burden. Why, Lord Babington, you amaze me. I'm starting to find you slightly better company. HE LAUGHS I have never met anyone else who can give a compliment in such a way as it might also be an insult. You are extraordinary... Miss Denham. Quite extraordinary. All pretence aside, I... I've never met any woman who has conjured up such feelings in me. I'm all at sea. It's getting cold, Lord Babington. We should go back. I cannot go back. I am compelled to go forward. Miss Denham... ..will you do me the honour of becoming my wife? SHE LAUGHS This is ridiculous. I'm serious. I wasn't expecting this. They only need one more run to win. Don't go soft on her. You don't need to tell me that. Come on, Miss Heywood! Come on, Stringer! CHEERING Well done, Sidney! Well done, Miss Heywood! Fantastic. Was that a smile I detected? Oh, I doubt it. I'm sorry you lost, Mr Stringer, but thank you for going easy on me. It was very chivalrous of you. You won fair and square. Perhaps we might play on the same team next time. Yes. I'd like that very much. Well done, Miss Heywood! If you don't tell her, how will she ever know? Well done, Miss Heywood. Thank you. Mr Parker! It's Miss Lambe. I've lost her. I can't find her anywhere. What?! Excuse me. Who won? Does it matter? I thought winning was everything to you, Edward. Oh, it depends on the prize, Esther. Well, you look flushed. Where have you been? Down by the river. Just walking. With him? You know I was. Why are you pretending? I just wanted to hear it from your own lips. He asked for my hand. Are you going to accept? Isn't that what you wanted? Is that what you want? In all honesty? He makes me laugh. I'd forgotten how that felt. I can do so much more than make you laugh. Mr Parker. Georgiana has disappeared off the face of the earth. No-one's seen her anywhere. Mr Parker, there's... Mr Parker, there is some news of Miss Lambe. One of the men saw her waiting, outside the hotel. What do you mean, waiting? When? What, what time? About four o'clock. The next thing was, a carriage drove up. A man got out. A man? She was meeting a man? Was this man black? Why would you ask that? Was he? All he said was, there were two of 'em. The other was in the carriage. She was bundled in and, and they took off. Bundled?! Thank you, Mr Stringer. I'm grateful. I hope you find her. Mrs Griffiths, please show Mr Stringer out, now. You know something, don't you? I have been acting as go-between for Georgiana and Otis Molyneux since you forbade them from seeing each other. HE SIGHS Her heart was broken, Mr Parker, I could not bear to see it. They arranged to meet today. During the cricket match. You did what? I was to accompany her. I never would have let them meet alone. I was caught up in the excitement of the match and I'd... forgot. You... ..you forgot? SHOUTS: You forgot! Yes! Yes. And I'm sorry. She must have sneaked off. She was desperate to see him. She would not be stopped. If anything happens to her, anything, it will be on your head. Do you understand me? Miss Denham. Lord Babington. You sent for me? Yes, I did. I see that I am not to be invited in. No. Lord Babington, please. You must see it would be an unmitigated disaster. I could never contemplate a proposal from someone as shallow as you. You still believe me shallow? You proposed on a whim. It's hardly a sign of depth. Is this your honest answer... ..without a shred of pretence? Yes, it is. Please, let me take the carriage. No, Charlotte. I will go to London and look for her and Otis myself. I know where he lives because I've been writing to him. I will start there. You would be all alone. It's too dangerous. I will not countenance it. Then I will go to Tom as soon as I arrive. You cannot rely on Tom. No, Charlotte, that's my final word. He is a lord! He has a fortune! Why did you refuse him? Because I do not love him. SHE SCOFFS Love? Love? Love! What does love have to do with anything? Marriage is a business arrangement, nothing more. Do you think I married... for love? Aunt... You have the Denham name, but a name won't see you through without a dowry. Go. I am done. Esther. I feel quite unwell. Erm... Help me! Aunt?
