 Next time you find yourself in trouble, you call judge Williams. If I quit the city council race... Then you have a new friend. You're working on the novel. That's great. It's shit. What the fuck am I doing here anyway? How's he doing? Well, I'll know exactly when his blood work comes back, But he's not well. This is your new kitchen. Yeah. No staff, no silverware; just me and my propane. Why is that goddamn blue tarp back on the roof again?

Yeah, that's pretty much a normal day for me. ( laughs ) I know. That's the problem with New Orleans-- Too many people live like you. Au contraire. Not enough people do. Speaking of work, I gotta go. Uh, do you need help tomorrow? - I already asked Jacques. - Aw. I know you mean it, but asking you to work Mardi Gras-- That's like asking Paul Prudhomme Not to use fat, salt and cayenne pepper. You know, I gotta say this: I'm concerned about your eternal soul. I'm not positive, But it may be a mortal sin to work Mardi Gras. Just the morning. That would be venial. All right, 10 hail Marys. Go forth, my child, and sin no more. - Have a good one. - Yep. - ( starts engine ) - Hey, maybe we'll run into each other. - Fuck off. - Yeah. ( both laugh ) ( ticking ) - ( sighs ) - Any minute, mama. Should've put the gumbo on, but I can't till they get here. Once I get started with that roux, I'm stuck.

Come and get you something to eat. - All right. - Morning. - Hey, stranger. - Or is it afternoon? - Just barely. - Looking for some lunch? - I'm good. What are you working on? Oh, the next step-- a proper autopsy. I thought that was on hold. Oh, yeah, until after the holiday. The family can't focus right now. How's it going? - I'm seeing light at the end of the tunnel. - Oh, that's great. As long as it's not the proverbial oncoming high-speed light rail. ( laughing ) - Daddy! - True about absence and a fonder heart. - Hi, sweet pea. - Hey. You sure you don't want some lunch? I was gonna take a ride, clear my head, Get a coffee. Can I come? - Please? - Yeah, sure. Let's go. ( ringing ) - Mr. Foster. - Hey, Delmond. Listen, I'm sorry to tell you this. The hearing's been postponed now till Wednesday. Aw, fuck. You can't be serious. I don't know exactly what's going on er there. I do-- they're sending him a message. - I suppose they are. - Bet your ass. You keep a big chief locked up on Mardi Gras day-- that's a message. I don't know if you can change your plans. - I guess I have to. - All right. Sorry about this, man. Have a good Mardi Gras. Yeah, I'll see you Wednesday. All right, I'll see you then. Anything else I can get you? A hotel room. Heh, good luck with that, brother. It's like seeing an ancient ruin. That's where jaeger's used to be. Fitzgerald's. Bruning's, both of them-- The new one and the original, Which was wrecked by hurricane georges-- The third oldest restaurant in the city After Antoine's and Tujague's, 1859. Back in the day it was a cabaret. They had slot machines, dancing girls-- All kinds of mischief. Over there, that was a foot bridge to the bruning home, The one they used in "the big easy." - Hey, Cher? - Fais do-do, baby. And then also over to sid-mar's. Where was sid-mar's? See the pumping station? - Wow. - Gone. ( sighs ) Like it never existed. - It's really creepy. - Yeah. It's good to get out and see the destruction. It's good. Get off the isle of denial every once in a while And be reminded how much of the city is still wrecked. - I know, but-- - Yeah, tomorrow, fat Tuesday-- You know the exact date? February 28th. Six months almost to the day. Six months. And we're gonna party like we know how, Second line like there's no tomorrow, Mardi Gras our asses off In the ruins of the Crescent city. And we should. But it's good to keep this in mind too. I know. I'm bumming you out, aren't I? Kinda, yeah. Let's go catch a parade. ♪ red, yellow, green, purple or blue ♪ ♪ we make a new suit... ♪ Oh shit! - ( laughing ) - What the fuck? Y'all wanna see a grown man cry? That shit ain't funny, man. I'm afraid I got some bad news, y'all. You sure you don't need a place to stay? I got the room. Thanks, I got a friend in the quarter. I can just stay with him. - You tell your father I'm thinking of him. - Wish I could. I won't see him till Wednesday now either. I hate to think of him all alone on Mardi Gras of all days. It is his sacred holiday, all right. - Not you? - To be honest, In my opinion New Orleans is better off without it. - Really? - Why not put all that time, Energy and money into fixing up the place? Well, excuse me. I got a little more work to do. St. Joseph's less than three weeks away. Right. ( jazz music playing ) ( crowd cheering ) Thank you very much. Thank you very much. My name is Bob french. We're gonna take a slight pause for a very worthy cause. We'll be back in a little bit. - Don't you go nowhere, hear? - Crowd: Yeah! Al Johnson. It must be carnival time. Antoine batiste, you tore it up, man, tore it up. - It's good to see you, man. - Same here. - Awesome, batiste. Just awesome. - Thank you, man. - You good? - I'm good. I'm better than good. - I'll see you, man. - All right. - Antoine batiste? - Whoa! Oh ho ho, Mr. Toyama! - What you doing here? - Mardi Gras. I thought this year, this would be the year. Yeah, it's good to see you. It's good to see you. - Let me buy you a drink. - It would be my honor to buy you a drink. Oh no, God damn it. I'm gonna buy you a drink, all right? - Take yes for an answer. - I accept. - All right. - Thank you. Two jameson and cokes. A Mardi Gras drink. You'll like it. "milenberg joys," one of my favorite jelly roll Morton songs. Yeah? You know what milenberg was, huh? The red-light district-- yeah, out by the Lake. Before storyville. Long gone now. "milenberg joys"-- original recording, New Orleans rhythm kings, 1923. George Brunies on trombone. All right, I'll take your word for it. Cheers. - Happy Mardi Gras. - Happy Mardi Gras. - Very sweet. - That's why I like it. Now listen, you may have noticed I'm playing my old trombone. Oh, please, no need to explain. No, it's an interesting story. See, I found my old one, In a pawnshop as a matter of fact. A pawnshop? Really? So I gave the one you bought me To my teacher, Danny Nelson. He lost all of his in the storm, Including the 'bone kid Ory gave him When they were gigging out on the West coast. - So anyway-- - I was very sorry to hear of Mr. Nelson's passing. - You heard? - It was big news in Japan. Really? Well, among fans of traditional New Orleans jazz music, yes. That's good to hear. Pssh, 'cause it should've been bigger news here. So anyway, it was passed on To his grandson. So you see, that's how we do it in New Orleans, How a tradition lives on. - Very Japanese. - No kidding? Grandfather to grandson. That pleases me very much. To Danny Nelson. ( slaps bar ) To Danny Nelson. Good parade, sweetie? I love the night parades. Momus, that was my favorite night parade. You're too young to remember. You were about two when they stopped rolling. Momus, the God of mockery. The parades were political, satirical. I can't believe you're waxing nostalgic About the knights of momus. Masked riders on horseback with pointy hoods? - Hello? - The parades were beautiful. The floats, the flambeaux-- Black men carrying flaming propane torches And scrambling for change tossed in the street. It had its antebellum aspects, I'll admit. - That's part of carnival. - I hate the flambeaux and the hooded masked riders. I wished they'd do away with all that. I wouldn't miss the old line carnival stuff at all. - I would. - That's because you're not from here. When you grow up with it, it has a whole other meaning. Sometimes they throw the baby out with the king cake. I like endymion. That's my favorite. ( fakes choking ) Super Krewes-- B-list celebrities, tons of plastic beads. Like everything else in American culture-- Cheap, mass-produced, made in China. Well, thanks for raining on my parade. You're welcome. Mwah. - Good night, honey. - Night. - Night, mama. - Night night. I've gotta go to bed too. Don't you stay up too late. - Big day tomorrow. - Don't I know it. Mm-hmm. - Where are you going? - It's Mardi Gras, darling. I know. I thought we were spending the day together. You know, I think I need a day apart. Like the rebirth says, "do what you wanna." That's what today's all about, right? You just wanna get high. That's what you wanna do. Be good... Or don't. Fucking asshole. ( piano music playing ) This should be our national anthem. Sounds kinda like a national anthem. Bobby short said "satin doll" Should be our national anthem. Oh, what does he know? I'd cast a vote for "it ain't necessarily so." That'd be my second choice. Well, let's go. - You gonna turn that off? - No no no no no. It's bad luck to turn it off. It's on repeat. It'll stay on till we get home. - Hup-hup. - Whoohoo! - Bye, grandma. - Bye, grandma. Bye. ( chuckles ) - Y'all have fun. - Man, I wish you were coming with us, grandma. - Ooh, baby, grandma too old for the parades. - No, you're not. Tell you what, maybe I'll go next Mardi Gras, When we're all together again. Larry: We'll be back for that gumbo.

I rue the day I married into this family. - All: Oh! - Yeah, y'all are incorrigible. The same jokes every year and they don't get better with age. - It's a beautiful day though, huh? - Perfect. - Zulu was out of sight. - They were tremendous as usual. - I love zulu. - I know you do, mother. - It's one of your redeeming characteristics. - I got a coconut. - Don't you always? - Pretty much.

Hate to see it come apart at the seams." Carnival's done-- Farewell to flesh-- In the land of dreams, In the land of dreamy dreams. Way down yonder, heaven on earth. They called it New Orleans. Living here now is like a dream, The way that everything in a dam is the same Yet not the same, familiar yet strange, Not quite right, But you just can't put your finger on it. New Orleans was a soap bubble-- And it had a hell of a run. But now it's done. Whatever comes next... Is just a dream of what used to be. I wonder when they stopped doing midnight mass For Ash Wednesday. We can come back at 7:00 A.M. No, I don't think so. ( laughs ) All right, ready? There. What do you think? I think burned "gambit" pages work pretty well. ( coughing ) What? I didn't give up weed for lent. Oh, what did you give up? I'll have to get back to you on that. What about you? Oh, I'm thinking about going home maybe For a while. - Home? - New York. Wow! You're giving up New Orleans for lent? That's radical. I don't know. Maybe. I'm anticipating munchies momentarily.
