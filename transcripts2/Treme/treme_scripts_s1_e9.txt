 I don't get it. I'm saying I need to take a moment to myself here. Musically or what? It's just the music. It's like I said. Would you rather it was the other way? That we broke up but kept playing together? Why? We're just starting to hit our stride. I need to stretch myself, you know? I have to play in different styles. We're not practicing anymore. - We're not working on arrangements. - What the fuck, Annie?

 You're drunk or high half the time. I mean, personally I'm not your mother And I wouldn't complain about it. It's just it's hard to play music when you're like that. - You got gigs lined up? - No. - Bullshit! This is bullshit, Annie. - Okay, it's bullshit, But I think we should take a break from playing together. Without me you got no frontman. You don't sing much. - You got nothing but the fiddle. - I'll do what I can. So what, I go out on the street And you go play somewhere else and then we crawl into bed At the end of the day like it's no big deal? - Sonny, it's no big deal. - Fuck no. We play together.

 If we don't play together, we aren't together. - Sonny, please. - Either you're with me or you're not. - Get your shit out of my apartment. - Sonny, I-- Go!

I believe I'll fulfill my obligation for today. - Sorry. - No worries. I'm not one of those militant ex-smokers. - It's good you quit. - Because of my size? Yeah, tobacco would be one more bullet in the chamber. Shall we? This book is really old. Yes, it is. But "the awakening"'s human concerns are as relevant today As they were at the end of the 19th century. Hey, at least it's short. Yeah, thank you, Professor Bernette. True. So I want you to take your time with it. Pay attention to the language itself, the ideas. Don't think in terms of a beginning and an end, Because unlike some plot-driven entertainments, There is no closure in real life, Not really. You said that all books are about a problem That the protagonist has to solve. Or a quest. The protagonist is looking for something. So what's Edna looking for? Edna's journey is... She's looking for truth Or some kind of peace. Now what can y'all tell me about the author? She was a local? Kate Chopin lived all over Louisiana-- New Orleans, Natchitoches parish. She was the daughter of a galway man, Creole-- mostly on her mother's side. She was colored? Creole in the old sense of creole. Professor Bernette, I know that Class participation is 10% of our grade, But are the discussions themselves going to be on the test too? Gwyneth, my dear, Everything will be on the test And the test will be everything. But fear not, For in the end every one of us will be tested And every one of us will be found wanting. A man on the phone tells me he regrets to inform me That my son is dead. I told him I am looking at my only son Right there in the kitchen fixing a sandwich. What did he say to that, miss cherry? He said, "huh?" Just like that-- "huh?" Then he asked to speak to my son and I put Jerome on. The man says, "is this Jerome cherry?" I say so and he asks if I was locked up In the Orleans parish. I tell him I never been locked up anywhere, not in my whole life. - What did he say to that? - He said "thank you" and hung up. - This caller give a name? - He gave it, But I didn't pay it no nevermind. And I suppose you didn't have any reason To talk to Ladonna or her mother about this phone call, did you? Didn't talk to no one. I just figured they had the wrong Jerome cherry. You're saying it was my cousin Daymo they had under my name. Crazy. Watch yourself coming through, mama. The bulk of my weight is back here. All of this is gonna go to auction. I sold the walk-in already, But we still have the prep tables, The hoods, ventilation. Is there a significant value here? I'll get something. And whatever the amount, it'll come right back to you, I promise. Honey, that's not why I was king. Daddy's just concerned about you, not the money. Oh, don't worry about me. I'll be fine. I'm already on to the next thing. Which is? I've been taking my act on the road-- guerrilla chef. I got a kitchen on wheels. I've done four events ready. I've netted myself almost $1,500. That much? On a good night I could clear as much profit As I did at the restaurant even without the liquor markup. "bacchanal?" Wine store-- in the courtyard they have in the back. You guys should stay an extra day and come. I'll show you how it works. So you're staying in the restaurant business? What else would I do with myself? Aside from moving back to Huntsville And getting married to some lumpy lawyer And popping out grandkids, one after the next? Would that be so bad? I'm sorry, guys. I'd rather have my head dipped in duck fat And shoved in a French oven. ♪ you better go back to your used to be ♪ ♪ because your love's no good to me ♪ ♪ I hear you knockin'... ♪ Man, why you gotta do that, man? I knocked, dude. I see you've got smiley cranked to, like, 11. That's Huey Smith on ivories, not Billy fucking Joel. You can't listen to that shit pianissimo. What-- what's up, man? I'm having a record release party On account of my e.P. Just went gold. New Orleans gold that is, Meaning I'm still getting consignment checks two months later. Anyway, we need to have a celebration To cure the postmortem depression. There ain't been an epic throw-down - Around the way since carnival. - Subtle as ever. My party plan is basic: Only musicians And hot women are invited. Musicians for a jam session, Hot women for reasons requiring no elaboration. - Musicians, hot women... - Mm-hmm. Lose the musicians, I think you got something there. You know nothing of my alchemy. Live music is what brings women, fool. Come on, we gotta go run some of these off, Get 'em up on telephone poles. Oh, I need a keg and a bag of endo, so... But you're going in with me, right? Shit, Davis.

They wanted him to stay Jerome cherry, Because if he stayed Jerome cherry in that refrigerated trailer, Then no one would come looking for him. But why, Toni? Because something happened in that parish jail That they don't want us to know about, Something more than your brother falling off his bunk and hitting his head. See? Look at this. "common nud--" what does that mean? The injury was to the back of the head Which could be from a fall, but it could also be That he was struck with a blunt instrument or kicked in the head. I promise you, Ladonna, we're gonna get - To some kind of truth. - Please. Please. I know this hurts right now. I know it must feel like all you wanna do - Is mourn for David, but... - Toni. ...It's important, Before you go any further with funeral arrangements, That we have a chance to do An independent autopsy. No. Ladonna, given the circumstances of David's-- Oh no, Toni, no. I'm going out to see the cemetery people tomorrow. Daymo going home this weekend. We'll have an autopsy done before then, I promise you. No. Now see, you're trying to find out If Daymo got beat on in that prison upstate, right? What if he did? What if he got beat on by some inmate Or by a guard even? What then, huh? You think getting my family all riled up Over what might have happened to Daymo Was gonna make this any easier? Hell no. All this mess gonna do is make it harder. It's about right and wrong, Ladonna. The boy is dead. It stays wrong for us no matter what else happens. And giving my mama somebody to blame and hate on Only makes it harder to get past it. Ladonna, please, just think about this. That's all I'm asking. - Hey. - Annie? You leave or did he--? Can I stay for a night or two until I figure something out? - Yeah, no problem... - Thank you. - ...If that sofa works for you. - Yeah. I mean, I don't think we're all gonna fit in here Once Dena gets back off her tour. - She uses this front room to rehearse. - Of course. Just a couple of days. I need to go back for the rest of my stuff Once I know where I'm going. After I told him I didn't want to play with him, He just went off on me. Annie, you told Sonny you didn't want to play music with him? Well, for now, yeah. Just until he gets his shit together. But so what? It wasn't like I was trying to break us up. I mean, I'm not asking to fuck anyone else, Just gig with them, you know? Yeah, I don't know. You know, fucking is fucking, But music... That's personal. Time is short. We gotta hurry if I'm gonna make it out the door. It always comes down to the last minute, daddy. It always comes down to everyone in the family Working like crazy so you could take that walk. I'm surprised you ain't got Sherry and the kids up in here working. Are you gonna blame a man For wanting to have his loving family together? Every year we're working on a better vision. You gonna be pretty, Albert. My first year not having a whole new suit. Can't believe what that storm did. You got us up in here sweatin' And now you're gonna get extra particular? I don't want you to think I don't appreciate your efforts. The truth is we all gotta make do with some of last year's suits. Man, at least y'all got enough to make do. I ain't got nothing yet. I'm just saying where's my suit? - That's all. - Shit. Boy, you trippin'. U got to earn that one, son. I felt the same way when I was younger, Seeing my father walk out the door On st. Joseph's night all bold and proud, Suit sparkling in the streetlight. I wanted to be making that walk with him. I just wanna mask with y'all, that's all. You're not ready. Not just yet.

I know big d's looking forward to that. So what is on the menu anyway? Whatever looks fresh at the market in the morning-- Apps, three entrees, dessert. Last time I cooked at bacchanal I did maybe 100 plates, But this time with you guys I'm hoping to pack the place. - Cool, let's go for it. - So we should firm it up. What do you say to $1,000 for the night? Uh, I would say $1,200. It's a small venue, But we need at least that just to plug in. - I could use a break. - That is a break, baby. Okay, all right. - All right, all right. - Bye. Looking forward to sampling your fare. - Looking forward to it. - See ya. Let's run that little baseline again. Three, four. Yeah. Relentless, d. Relentless. You have to come. Hi, my name is Davis. Will you come to my party? You come too, man. All right? Brother Antoine, I hate to interrupt your meal, But you gotta come to this. What that is? Um, just the party of the year. We'll be jamming till the break of dawn. All right, I'll try to be there. Whoa! Who's this here? - That's my daughter, man, HonoreÃ©. - Dude-- Her mama was supposed to meet up with me And get her before the gig, but she's late. Dude, she's done up like a pork chop, man. Aw, damn, girl, what is you doin'? Oh, no no no no! That was so me Mardi Gras before last. - Hey, Davis, do me a favor. - I was out-- Grab me some paper towels or something. I'd love to help. Got a few more stops to make. - Sorry, bro. She's cute. - Bro! - She's really cute. - You better not run away. Hey. Huh-uh. - Later. - Ah. Mm mm mm. Dinner's ready, daddy. I just wanna finish this paragraph. I'll be in in a minute. Good as gold. Hey, come on! All right! I, uh-- I thought you were gonna be out. I decided to stick around in case you needed Some help with your stuff. You working on something? A couple of songs. Okay, the seeds of songs, but yeah. I've been thinking I need to write Some original stuff. How's it going? Fine. You've been in my head, Annie. The taxi's double-parked. I'll be back in a few days To get the rest of this and drop my key off. I want you to keep that key. I'd better go. Look, I made a mistake. Put that down for a minute. - Let's talk about it. - I can't right now. You need some time, I'm with that. So-- so what about I call you? Maybe we could meet somewhere for coffee. Coffee would be all right. We did take 4' of water. Why we ain't heard a damn thing about this until now? I got to bring my brother up in here this weekend. Ma'am, we've been sending letters since late January. You're joking, right? My mama lives on valence street. She still ain't getting mail regularly. We're gonna fix this, ma, okay? Don't worry. We got the perpetual care, right? Sure, which provides for gravesite care Under basic situations. But with an act of God such as a hurricane, There's nothing in the perpetual care pack-- Damn. You know who you sound like? Allstate, yeah. Come on, ma. You need to sit somewhere. I'll deal with this. - How could David-- - I'll fix it, ma. I will. Hey, neighbor. Hi. Uh... Ah. "heaven must be like this." - Huh? - The Ohio players. It's the bad solo jam off of "skin tight." So I'm having a party tonight, my crib. We gotta work tonight. But we'll come over after. Anything we can bring? Your... Personalities. Thank you! See you tonight. See ya. Thank you. Thank you! Yes! Mr. Lambreaux. I'm sergeant Maurice Thompson from community relations. - Mm-hmm. - You remember we met back at Calliope, right? - This here's lieutenant Colson. - What can I do for you two? - You mind if we have a word? - Outside. I see you're working hard on your suits in there. Look, Mr. Lambreaux, this thing between Indians and police goes back a long ways. But last year it got really ugly on st. Joseph's. We don't want to see it going there again. We're trying to keep something alive here And y'all trying not to see it. - Now that's on y'all. - No, that's on both sides, chief. Now you know damn ll when the Indians put those suits on, Go out in the street, they ignore everything the police tell them. I understand pride, officers, But it seems that your gang don't think Anyone other than themselves is entitled to any. Pride got you beat up that day at the Calliope, Got you swinging on a patrolman. It was me that received the first blow. Look, chief, you're out on bail 'cause you hit a cop and everyone knows it. Now it's clear nothing I say is gonna stop you or your gang From coming out on st. Joseph's night, Stepping into traffic, moving without a permit. And that means that any street cop Could think they'd get a free shot if they wanted. - You saying your people coming for us, huh? - No no. I'm saying that I'm worried. Now last year I watched this thing spin out of control. Now maybe because of that, Maybe because of what happened after with big chief tootie, I was told to come up with a tactical plan for this year, Stop it all from happening again. Well, son, what's your plan? Hell if I know. But I do remember before he fell out at the council meeting, Big chief tootie was talking about the old days. You remember? He talked about how the police would be Tightening the straps on their batons. And he would tell his gang not to look at them, To step past the fight if they could. Big chief tootie died on the battlefield. It might have been the city council chamber to you, But it was the battlefield for us. But tootie wasn't looking for a battle that day. He was looking for some other way. You giving your gang the same message You're bringing mine? I'm trying to. And the damn contract we got for perpetual care Is like 20 pages of tiny-ass print. Crazy. You call Toni Bernette? That lawyer might could help. I ain't doing no more lawyers. All I need is to move that funeral back a week And find the money to get that crypt fixed up before then. - That's a I gotta do. - You ain't got the money. Mm, the man saying it's nearly $2,000 in work - To get it back right. - Whew. So go to Larry. I mean, he gonna do the right thing on this. Nah, I can't ask him for it when it's my family's crypt. He don't care. - He got the money and you in need. - Huh-uh. I don't want it to be like that. I start leaning on his money, Soon enough he gonna be talking about There ain't no reason for me to keep this bar going here. Mm-hmm. So how much you got? On hand, after I pay the liquor man, $1100, $1100. Mm-hmm. $150 right there. Antoine, that nonsense last week between you and me-- That was a Mardi Gras fuck, that's all. - That ain't got nothing to do with it. - I'm just saying. We in lent now. The legs are closed. Just pick up the money, Ladonna. Stop talking shit. You need to bury your damn brother. Thank you, Antoine. We family. We're kind of closed right now, son, Unless you want something to go.

I did call the police that time last summer When you were rehearsing the brass band On the first floor. - That was me. - Dude, don't worry on it. You called the cops For loud music in the treme? Bygones bygones. I didn't know he did it. I had nothing whatsoever to do with that. Any other secrets you'd like to unburden yourself of? Don, lighten up! - It's bygones. - Come on, baby. No fighting, no fighting. God, Allan, I cannot believe You would just lie to me like that. I don't know who I'm living with anymore. It's a vale of tea. Henry. Hey, darlin'. Where you been at? Party's spent. A good one though while it lasted. Party? Is Davis still up? Still up, Still crazy. I just knew something was gonna come through for me tonight. Something? Someone. You had a pay, Davis? You didn't invite me. Oh. Uh... Well, you had your gig at bacchanal And I didn't-- I didn't want you to be upset. Yeah, my gig at bacchanal... What's wrong? You have class today? Freshman lit, my calling. I thought that was an 11:00. I'm not leaving yet. I have some things in the office I need to do before I go. Dad could drop me off at school later. It's not like we're doing anything important in first period anyway. None of it's important according to you. - You're coming with me. - Dad. Better listen to your mom. Mm. You all right, Cray? Well, once more into the brief. Hey, Sofia! Sweetie, daddy. - I-- I just... - What? I just wanted to tell you you look very pretty today. Really nice. Thanks, daddy. - Enjoy your day. - I will. - Hey, Toni. - Huh? Kick a little ass today. You buckled up? - Mm, morning. - Hmm. I'm sorry about your night. I'm glad you ended it here though. No, don't be. The thunderstorm cleared things up for me. There'll be other opportunities. I know that, but not here. Ugh, not that again. - You can't-- you can't be serious. - Mm, I am. You're a damn good chef. I am better than good, but this town beat me. As much as I love it, I'm not trying to fight with it anymore. But New York? I wanna see how I stack up Against the big boys, you know? Without all these-- these broke-ass levees - And blocked gas lines and-- - Hey. May I quote the author of "la cuisine creole"? I believe it's your professional bible. Jesus, Davis, do you ever stop? New York is very fashionable and fast, So fast you can't even stroll through it. You just get pushed along. And don't plan on getting invited to any backyard barbecues - Because there ain't no backyards. - You don't know that. Everyone dressed in business suits, Working working working. Of course the, uh-- what do you call it? - The financials are very strong. - Davis-- Would you rather have a strong economy Or a four-hour lunch? Would you rather have a Macy's day parade With fucking Bullwinkle floats Or an impromptu second line Where you dance your ass off with your neighbors? Is your check from the tourism board in the mail? There are so many... Beautiful moments here. They're just moments. They're not a life. You about to sit there all day? What else I'm gonna do? Well, we could use a little help. See if you can do better on a job than the last time. What's the job? I got a rack of supplies I gotta pick up at home depot, Store here in the bar-- gypsum and alum. - What's that? - Raw materials for plaster. - Boy, you wanna make some coin or what? - I ain't seen nothing yet, After all that work I did helping him with that suit. You do my lifting for me, You'll get a little something today. All right. Shit, I don't know which one of you two I feel more sorry for. "she was blindly following whatever impulse moved her" As if she had placed herself in alien hands for direction "And freed her soul of responsibility." Okay, Ben? I'm just trying to put this book into perspective. Is "the awakening" the first women's lib novel or something? I wouldn't-- no, to label it as such Would be to ghettoize a great work. Well, what happens to Edna was-- I thought it was really depressing. No no. This isn't a feminist manifesto. This book is not about Edna's emancipation From male authority And the ending of the book Is not the end. It is a transition, A rejection of disappointment and failure. The farther Edna walks away From the constraints of society and convention, The more free she becomes. She's not moving toward the darkness. She's embracing spiritual liberation. I'm gonna let y'all go early today. All right! - Go out and read. It's a glorious day.
