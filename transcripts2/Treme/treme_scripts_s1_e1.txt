( music playing ) - Where is everyone? - Pedro's running late. - Wardell? - Irene's. - 10 an hour. - Dishwashing? Damn, things are outta whack. What's your cousin doing- Raymond? I could call him. Yeah, if you wouldn't mind. What about Pedro? Oh, I'm so over Pedro. The one I really miss is David. Daymo! - That's my boy. - Ah! Oysters. See? It's gettin' better. It's oyster season. How bad could life be? Janette, it's half. That's not going to get us through the night. I could run out to dorignac's. They got crawfish. And we could parade naked down prytania street too, But I'm not gonna do it. No fucking frozen Chinese crawfish in my kitchen. Charmaine... she should be setting up. ( sighs ) Fuck me. I was about to say she called. - And? - She's not coming in. Fender bender on canal- says she was distracted. We're all distracted. How's your house? Don't ask me about my house. Never thought I'd come back to see even this much of it. This goddamn bridge. Gretna police standin' there with their guns out, Waiting to make us walk the hell back. And here we are, drivin' the other way Like it didn't even happen. You don't have to stay. Just drop me and turn around. I'll be fine. Drop you where exactly, daddy? ( distant jazz music playing ) Woman: Whoo-ooh! Yeah! ( crowd chattering ) ( music continues ) - ( music stops ) - ( all cheering ) Cold beer. Nice to see you too. Get me a shot of good whiskey, son. Y'all hangin' out? Go get three. - You know what I'm saying? - Give me one. ( all hollering, chattering ) ( R&B; music playing ) Man, you gotta put those stinky dogs away, man. Nobody want to smell that. Man, I'm like to die here, fool. - ( all laugh ) - thought you could hang, huh? Thought you was gonna teach us young'uns something, huh? Oh, yeah. Oh, hell yeah. That note he was looking for on the last chorus? - The high note? - What note was that, maestro? What the fuck came out your horn, man? - Fuck you, man. - Was definitely a clam I heard. Now see here. I came up flat 'cause y'all decided to end the damn pade at my ex-wife's joint. A man can only take so much shit in stride. You two were married? - A long time ago. - Man, how you let that slip away? Let me? Shit. I busted out of that situation. What went wrong? He wasn't treatin' you like I would be treatin' you? You wanna know what went wrong? - Yeah, tell it, darlin'. - Tell it. I married a goddamn musician. Ain't no way to make that shit right. - Ooh! - All: Damn! Y'all don't even know. The explosion people heard Was actually an unsecured barge Ramming into the canal wall, not dynamite. People think there was a conspiracy Drown 80% of the city? Vees. In whose interest was that? Why displace so many working class folks, black and white? It makes no sense. Are you saying this was a natural disaster, - Pure and simple? - A natural disaster? A hurricane is. - What hit the Mississippi Gulf coast Was a natural disaster... a hurricane, pure and simple. The flooding of new Orleans Was a man-made catastrophe. A federal fuck-up of epic proportions. - And decades in the making. - Daddy! We can edit that out, no worries. The levees were not blown. Not in '65 and not three months ago. The flood protection system Built by the army corps of engineers, A.K.A. The federal government, failed. And we've been saying for the last 40 years since Betsy That it was gonna fail again unless something was done. And guess what? It was not. - Seriously, daddy, you'reonna stroke out. - No worries, sweetheart. Cool as a cucumber up an archbishop's ass. The levees weren't blown. The floodgates failed, the canal walls failed, the pumps failed. All of which were supposedly built To withstand a much greater storm. Are you suggesting criminal liability? Absolutely. Find the responsible parties And put them on trial- corps of engineers; The federal, state, local government; The contractors who used substandard materials And the goddamn sleazebag politicians That they have in their pockets. So, given that it's all gone pear-shaped, Why should the American taxpayer foot the bill To fix new Orleans? It's going to cost billions. Well, since when don't nations rebuild their great cities? For the sake of argument, let's say new Orleans Was once a great city. Are you saying that new Orleans is not a great city... A city that lives in the imagination of the world? I suppose... if you're a fan of the music, Which has rather seen its day, let's be honest; Or the food, a provincial cuisine Which many would say is typically American, Too fat, too rich... then yes, of course. New leans has its advocates, But what about the rest of the country? Hmm. ( clears throat ) Provincial, passÃƒÂ©, Hate the food, hate the music, hate the city. What the fuck are you doing down here? You fucking limey vulture motherfucker! Oh! ( chuckles ) really, you can't just... This is goin' in too. - Come on, God damn it! - You go, daddy. Into the River! - Let's just finish this in a civilized manner. I'm just going to take it for a little swim. Come on! ( sighs ) You can't stay here, daddy. - I hate this. Why did we even- - - just wait. When the insurance settles... ( helicopter whirring ) ( sloshing ) Daddy? Daddy? Take me to miro street. You mean poke's? What's up? - The code is... - there he is. Mmm. ( plays blues riff ) ( clicks ) ( hip-hop music playing ) * say what? * - * you keep bumpin' me against the wall * * yeah, I know I let you slide before * - * but until you seen me * - * say what? * * trust * - * you ain't seen bouncin' back * * you keep bumpin' me against the wall * * yeah, I know I let you slide before * * but until you seen me * * trust * - * you ain't seen bouncin' back * * I really be throwin' my words, stand 'em up, jammin' on the one * * there ain't nobody but neptunes jammin' on the drum * * swift flip kicks landing from the tongue * * more dramatic than Batman and Robin, na na-na na-na na-na * * the one that be handling they business be sharper than a thumb-tack * * the one that be dropping these albums showing 'em how to come back * * and you gonna respect me and appreciate where I run at. * * hope this indecent proposal make you do somethin' with me * * fuck the dollar, girl, pick up 50... * - ( classical music blaring ) * and fuck a coward, girl, you need a real nigga * * off the top, nigga 'bout to turn the sh * * bend over, ho, show me what ya workin' with * * shake ya ass, but watch yourself * * shake ya ass, show me what you're working with * * attention all y'all players and pimps * - * right now in the place to be * - * shake ya ass * * I thought I told y'all niggas before... * - ( volume increases ) - * y'all niggas can't fuck with me * - * watch yourself * * now this ain't fun for small booties * * no sir, 'cause that won't pass * * show me what you're working with * * but if you feel you've got the biggest one * * then, woman, come shake ya ass * * shake ya ass, but watch yourself * * shake ya ass, show me what you're working with * * shake ya ass, but watcyourself * * shake ya ass, show me what you're working with * * I like 'em on fire like higher. * ( ragtime piano music playing ) - Hey, mama. - Hey, baby. Don't stop. It sounds good. Where's daddy? In the study getting ready for a phone interview. Another one? How'd it go on the levee today? - Daddy rocked. - Oh, no. Creighton: I didn't hit anyone. I would have, but I couldn't catch 'em. - Was it live? - No. Daddy threw the guy's microphone into the canal. He tried for the camera, but they fought him Pretty hard on that one. They're brits; They'll never use it. - Well, why wouldn't they? - They might. It was pretty, wasn't it, sof? - ( phone ringing ) - oh. - Who's this one with? - N.P.R. It'll be fine. It'll be fine. It's n.P.R. They get it. N.P.R., the "n" stands for "nuance." Hello. - How many f-bombs? - Yeah, I'm here. Five or six... and that thing he likes to say About the archbishop and the cucumber. ( laughs, groans ) How's school, Hmm? I hate Baton Rouge. I hate it more than words can say. Oh, it's only for another few weeks. - The girls must be nice, huh? - The girls are not nice. They're so like... The exact opposite of nice. You'll be back in time for carnival. - Christ, I hope so. - Sofia bernette! Catholic school... it's ruining me. Creighton: No, it's not! The old city was built On a natural levee on the high ground. No, that's not true. That's a misconception, a myth, a canard. ( whispers ) fucking n.P.R. The old city is not below sea level, it never has been. Well, that's because the media... And all due respect to your program, But you e one of the worst offenders- likes a simple narrative That they and their listeners Can get their tiny brains around. Who are you or anybody else To say which neighborhoods should come back?! Sofia: He's about to blow. - I know. - Hell yes, it's worth saving! The whole damn thing! Whoa whoa whoa whoa! You mean the federally- induced disaster? This is not a natural disaster. This is a man-made fucking catastrophe Of epic proportions! And, yeah, go ahead, bleep the whole goddamn thing! What do I care? We're dying down here! - ( beeps ) - this ain't Lake wobegon, God damn it. Oh! Red beans and rice. And it ain't even Monday. ( chuckles ) Thank you, baby. - How your mama and them? - Makin' do. Mmm. - She still tore up about daymo, you know? Nothing? No word still? Damn. ( helicopters whirring ) - The good dentist? - Good. He comin' down here or you goin' up there? Most weekends, I go up there. How his practice goin' up there? Mmm. He got a lot of his old patients. He comin' back? Not to new Orleans East again, he does. That building's a teardown for sure. Spoke to alcide the other night. You could come see him. Said he got a "b" on his algebra. Yeah, he doin' good. Randall too. I ain't got no wheels, ladonna. Now what's wrong with the bus they got Running up to Baton Rouge, huh? Free ride, you got no excuse. Now you know I got gigs on the weekends, - What gigs there are. - Go see 'em during the week. They miss you, especially with me Comin' down here all the time, Both of us gone, you know what I'm sayin'? I miss them too. I miss our routine. - ( groans ) - ( chuckles ) - I'm just sayin'. - ( laughs ) Yeah, I know you just sayin'. You know we could... ( both laugh ) Well, he up there, You down here. Who would know? I would, baby. I would know. I better be goin', me. Tell the boys I'll give 'em a call. You better. I will. ( dogs barking ) ( sighs ) ( train whistle blaring ) We gotta get that pork chop cleared. - All right. - Oh, that's pretty. Take a picture of that, man. - Two minutes on this, Jacques. - Workin' it. I need two pecan tarts. - We ran out. - Well, what's left? Lemon ice. - And if they don't want lemon ice? It's new Orleans, darlin'. Everybody wants lemon ice. You think I don'tdeal with d of thing every day? No doubt. A little more anger might be good for you too. Yeah, but is it going to do your argument any good? That's what I'm asking. Vinegar, no flies... It's honey gets the job done. A big ass fly swatter, That's what fucks up the flies, darlin'. What's all this about flies? - Not in my place, I hope. - Oh, course not. Our dinner was flyless... flawless, as well. - Thanks. - You're busy tonight. - Oh, every night. I could stay open till midnight every night if I had the staff. What do people in this town crave now? Good food, companionship, community. Mm, I crave dessert, myself. I'm out of everything but lemon ice. Sold. - Can't eat lemon ice. - What? It's homemade. It would be disloyal. He's waiting for brocato's to reopen. Oh, I understand that. How about a hubig's? Hubig's? What flavor? Uh, apple, for sure, maybe sweet potato. Ooh, sweet potato if got it, apple if you ain't. - Okay. - Hey, how's your house? Oh, don't ask me about fuckin' house. Aww. Hello. Everything okay? - Man: So, can I comp the salad? - Whatever. ( chopping ) - Hubig's? - Dress it up, baby. Drizzle something on it. ( panting ) ( helicopters whirring ) He in the bar, del. He livin' in the goddamn bar. He all up in there right now Tossing shit around, acting a fool. He got no business even being in new Orleans right now. You don't think I've been tellin' him that Since before we left Houston? Maybe he just needed to see for himself, you know? I've got to be at work in the morning. I ain't got time to hang around here waitin' for him. You need to come dn here and talk some sense into him. I know I can't. All right, I'll be down there. - ( man whistles ) - tell don I'm one for bird. Look, I got gigs, davina. I'm in New York couple more days, Then I'll be in Boston on Wednesday.

And you think I can? - I think it's your turn to try. - All right. - I'll be down. - When? As soon as I can. I've got to move A couple of things around. All right. Bye. Radio: * to miss new Orleans... * I hate that fucking song. ( music stops ) ( jazz music playing ) ( music continues ) Try the main line, jojo. See, I think your wrench is broke... Miss la-dee! Hey!

He ain't still locked up, is he? Locked up? What you mean? Daymo locked up in the storm. At o.P.P.? You seen him? We was up on broad street bridge together All the damn day after the jail flood. I thought we was going to die. So daymo ain't home yet? Demetrius, I ain't seen my brother since the storm. None of us have. Radio: That's the king on wwoz. And the emperor... Ernie k-doe. Ernie: I don't know what's wrong with him, But the nurses and the doctors And the people that went in there With the yelling, with the screaming, With the hollering... Jeffy Jeff, what up, my negro? Davis mcalary. K-doe rides again, huh? Mmm, yeah, a little Ernie rant To finish out a show. Yeah, master of the universe. Hey, so, dig... I'm not hung-over, I'm all psyched Because of a post-sex, Post-marijuana dream had me talking To the ghost of Earl king last night Who gave methe exact theme for my show. Earl's doing good by the way. - That's good to know. - Yeah, in heaven, The horn players don't make him tune down To e-flat to play "big chief," So he's got that workin' for him. But, um, anyway, So Earl comes at me with this political relevance, Which is weird because Earl Wasn't that way in life. But hey, it's my dream, right? - And Earl brings it. - Brings what? The mafia. The mafia? That's your theme? Dude! The mafia is way better equipped to run new Orleans Than the United States government, - The state of louisiana... - they used to run it. The marcellos used to run it all. Yeah, and fuck if it isn't time to bring 'em back! I mean, hey, do you think the mob Would have dragged ass the way fema did And left little old ladies to rot on rooftops? I mean, look how good Carlos ran things When the mayor and the governor and everybody else Was in his pockets? Look at the lafitte. Beautiful sicilian roof slate. Did they fall over? Did they flood? - But music... - Louis armstrong- - managed by Joe glazer Who had to pair up with the mob. Feel me? From there I segue into Louis prima Who was managed by the segreto family. After which, I'm close enough to some old-school R&B; To get up into cosimo's shop, Start spinning some Ray Charles, Some spiders, Lee Allen, May... Oh, you have got to be fucking kidding me! One in every three songs from a pledge-drive compilation? It's that time of year, bro. Well... Here we are, Supposedly the greatest alternative radio station In the greatest musical city In this sad, failed history of the planet And we're playing the same, admittedly great, 20 tunes that everyone hears on every fucking "big easy," "crescent city, " "care forgot" compilation Ever released! The fucking new Orleans fucking canon?! - Fuck me! - Yeah. And you gotta plug the cd at every break. - Darnell said so. - "iko," "tipitina"... "they all asked for you, " yeah yeah fucking yeah!
