Whoo! 63 00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:54,109 65 00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:00,716 67 00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:11,554 69 00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:17,692 - 70 00:06:21,897 --> 00:06:23,998 Poseurs! 72 00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:31,272 ( Car horns honking ) Woman: Picking up:
Tasting menu for three. - Okay, we're firing: Two scallop.
- Two scallop. - One ravioli.
- Man: Ravi-- Heard. - One pigeon and a duck.
- Man #2: One pigeon, one duck. - Next coming in: Three market salads.
- Man #3: Three salads. - Two tuna tartares.
- Man #4: Two tunas. - Two cod, one snapper.
- Two cod, one snapper. All right, watch yourself.
You got a cote for two walking in. - Man: Cote for two coming in.
- Young man. - Young man.
- Sir? Yes, you. Lobsters-- Get me some lob. Fuck me, no way.
He's not serious. Yes, he is.
And the best part is we've got no fucking lobster. He's got to send that kid to
fucking Chinatown to get some. 12 1.5 pounders. - Get me a receipt and hurry the fuck up.
- Right away, chef. No sleepers. Make sure they're happy.
I want peppy lobsters. - Yes, chef. Coming down the line!
- Peppy. Menu change: We're doing
butter-poached lobster with roasted corn coulis and something to be determined later.
Right now, entremetier, roast me
some fucking corn! Yes, chef. Oh my God,
he gives that to us-- I'm gonna go in the walk-in
and cry. Fuck. Degustation's got what?
We have-- We have the razor clams,
the salmon, the cod. Now he's gonna squeeze in
some fucking lobster? Why not just shove a goddamn
pineapple up my ass? He's giving it the saucier. The chef's been looking
at her funny all night. - You know the look?
- Yeah, I've seen it. In my fucking nightmares
I've seen it. That's why I try not to look
at the guy, you know-- Never directly, right?
'Cause the eyes is like his way in. That's how he gets you. That's how
he gets inside-- He looks at you. Then he crawls up
in your brain, takes a big dump on it.
And then he's got you. So avoid the eyes
is what you're saying. Yeah, avoid the fucking eyes. Chef:
Madame le saucier! Man:
It's looking good. - Yeah, chef.
- Ah. You'll be doing the lobster course.
Get your station ready. Absolutely, chef. Coming down line! Behind. Man: Hey, can you take
that for me, please? Man #2:
Right away, chef. ( Crowd cheering ) 127 00:08:43,043 --> 00:08:44,943 129 00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:50,114 131 00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,017 133 00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:06,059 ( Applause, cheering ) Malone:
There you go. Annie tee on the fiddle.
Annie tee on the fiddle. - ( Applause )
- Man: Love you, Annie! - Malone: Yes indeed.
- Love you. Back home it was
all saints' day. Y'all might not know that. They do all saints' day
up here in Connecticut? Man:
Whoo! How about all souls' day? Don't know it, huh? Well, in New Orleans
it's a pretty big deal, so we're gonna do this song
right here for you. All right? 149 00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,584 151 00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:15,488 Yeah, baby. 153 00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:19,791 155 00:10:23,261 --> 00:10:26,629 ( "Drop & gimme 50"
playing on radio ) Sofia b. Real here
from New Orleans. You may have forgotten about us, but we're still here. Y'all may have can we talk
abouts, the so-called recovery? It sucks the big one. 14 months and it ought to
be getting better here. 14 months and it ought
to be getting easier. It ought to be getting fixed.
You feel me? Well, it isn't. It gets harder every day. There's still 100,000 empty
houses in New Orleans at least, 100,000 families
that can't get home. Everyone in this freaking city
is on painkillers or booze. No kidding, 85% of the city
is doped just to cope. And you need an ak-47
to go out at night. And the freaking national guard is patrolling our streets like we're fallujah
or something. So you know what? Drop and give me 50,
you fucking fucks. ( Turns up music ) 177 00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:31,653 178 00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:33,121 ( Turns down music ) That was 10th ward buck
with his timeless standard, the evergreen
"drop & gimme 50." Oh, must be time for the o.Z.
Live music calendar. I'll be right back. Davis. Darnell, I thought
you left hours ago. I heard the show and came back.
Mix it up a little, will you? - Absolutely.
- I'm serious. So am I.
Look at my face. I got "gin in my system." I thought that was a coke. And don't spill it on the control board.
You will pay for this one. Empty threat.
Then you'd have me around for the next 20 years
working it off. I got "gin in my system"
on deck. Big freedia. A little tranny
bounce as a change of pace. That's now what I mean
by mixing it up. Brass band, funk, trad jazz, rock 'n' roll--
I don't care. Oh, I feel you.
How about a little acoustic piedmont blues
from bumble bee slim, a little lullaby to put
our audience to sleep? You know what?
I don't even mind you playing a little bounce
once in a while, just not nonstop. Mix it up, Davis. ( Sighs ) So go out and see
some live local music. Oh, and bring your gun. Uh, this one goes out
to someone who at the moment is very much on my mind. 213 00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:59,168 215 00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:06,306 217 00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,377 ( Playing solo ) Woman:
Yeah! ( Cheering and applause ) 222 00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:00,683 224 00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:07,256 ( Hip-hop music playing ) - It's more of a white thing.
- You think? Dressing up and shit?
Oh yeah. They got Halloween
in Holland, right? No. They don't?
Shit. They got mardi gras though? - Seven and seven?
- Yeah, man. That's a catholic thing. So what, y'all ain't catholic? Not so much.
We got queen's day. Everybody wears orange. Sounds like
hallo-fucking-ween to me. ( Gunshots, people screaming ) ( Woman moaning ) Five. We expect
the four wounded to recover. Sorry to disappoint you. I know that five dead
would make a better story. This is all
off the record, right? You want an official
statement-- You need
to call PIO Leads? No, no leads. One or two.
We're still sorting that out. No, things were worse
last spring and this summer. I'm sure it is having
an impact on tourism. That piece of mayhem didn't have
anything to do with Katrina. He was a vet-- Iraq. Listen listen, I read the note. I went to the scene. Stuff like that
can happen anywhere. The stove and the refrigerator. Yeah, but he didn't eat her, not like that guy in the
east village years ago. Uh-huh, look it up. You'll mention that
in your article? You're welcome. Jesus.
"The New York times"-- I think they live for the latest
grotesquerie from New Orleans. They just love them some Zack and Addie.
What've you got? A couple of knuckleheads
walk in a club, see another couple of knuckleheads,
go to the car, get their guns. Uh-huh, bring their
neighborhood shit down here. My phone's ringing
off the fucking hook. Shooting in the quarter
gets everybody's attention. Got mine. Good to go. - How's business?
- Booming. Really? More work than we can handle. Impressive. ( Distant sirens wailing ) Man:
Yeah, so-- So I guess I'll--
I'll see you around? ( Chuckles ) Who knows? - Have a good one, okay?
- Okay. - Bye.
- Bye. ( Neighbors yelling ) Go ahead.
You can say it. Hey, no comment
implied or intended. Far from it for I to be
judgmental and shit. Oh really?
So what? I don't know. You know,
first rule, right? Don't fuck the floor. Hey, he's not my floor.
That's not my restaurant. I got takeout on the way home. Is that okay? My apologies
for ever doubting you. Wake and bake? I gotta go to work. I guess you kind of need
your brain where you work-- Stay alert, stay alive
kind of a thing. You guys work stoned
where you are? No, not really. It's just we
don't have to be in till 2:00. ( Coughs ) Oh man, I would not want to be
fucked up at all around Brulard. Yeah, that dude senses fear, or at least that's what I hear. And then he fucks with you just to prove that
he can fuck with you, because he likes it,
because he loves it. - Good cook though, right?
- Oh, he's a great cook. - Mmm.
- Right? ( Car horns honking,
people chattering ) Man:
I'm on carroll street now. Yeah.
All right. ( Men conversing quietly ) Man:
Do the count. Hey. Hey. Hey. So are we good? Yeah, we're good. Come again. Thanks, man. Tell your friends, will you? What the fuck was that? He's cool.
We know him. Yeah, still. Need an eye opener? - ( Hammers banging )
- Hey, Riley, meet my cousin Nelson,
in from Dallas. ( Men conversing in Spanish ) - Thad Riley.
- Nelson Hidalgo. You related to him? By marriage. ( Speaks Spanish ) ( Riley and Hidalgo laugh ) Your Spanish is terrible, Coz. I can't understand a word. How long are you here for? I'll see how it goes. Welcome to New Orleans. I'm liking it so far. ( Car approaches, stops ) ( Car door opens, closes ) Jesus Christ, Albert. The fuck's my sign? ( Distant dog barking ) ( Sighs ) I can see why your mom
couldn't bear coming back. Once was all she could handle. Looka here.
Mama musta put them up there and forgot them. Kinda wrinkly. Oh, they didn't take no water. Not bad for being in this house for more than a year. Oof. I guess your mama's
doing the right thing. At least she'll get
something for it. Seems a shame though. You grew up in this house.
She grew up in this house. What little we get
from road home-- Can't fix it.
Can't afford to. Mm, I guess.
How soon will she get the money? They're saying four to six weeks after
you file they tell you how much. I gotta get through
the paperwork first. Well, you're good
at that though. They want a deed. Oh shit. Don't know how the fuck
I'm gonna get around that. Grandma got it
from her aunt Celeste whose daddy built it himself, who won the land
playing bid whist. It's just always been
in our family. Are we taking the bus or
are you gonna call a cab? ( Tisks ) I ain't walking all the way over to
no Saint Claude to wait on no bus. I'm calling.
I'm calling. You need to get
a job job, Antoine. Listen, I know, I know--
A job job. Maybe we could move into
the musicians' village. You really want to move all the
way down here in the ninth ward? Maybe. It's closer
for you though. We'd have to qualify
for a mortgage, might have to get married. Shit. Shit. Here it is. We're always suing the city. I am anyhow--
one thing or another. So after the shootings at the big second line
on MLK weekend-- I'm sorry. Shootings, MLK weekend,
second line. When did you get to town? September,
right after labor day. And you still haven't been to a second line?
You could have stayed in California. - I've been meaning to.
- We're gonna rectify that. This Sunday-- Sudan with new birth.
We're going. Sounds good.
Um, so these shootings? Well, if there's any violence
at all after the second line, NOPD always blames
the clubs. So after m.L.K.,
which is the same weekend Nagin plays the "chocolate
city" race card, Riley Jacks up the fees,
like, 300%. I mean, talk about
your mixed message. He says he needs to pay for overtime police protection with two hours before
and two hours after. - Is that new?
- Unprecedented. Next thing you know,
they'll be trying to make the Indians
have permits. And then there will be
blood in the streets. So you're suing the city
to roll back the fees. It's a huge thing.
It's about sustaining the culture. The city's always at war
with the Indians, the musicians,
the second-liners about noise, curfew,
permits. It's-- - Makes no sense.
- Yeah, they just don't get it. You'd think we came so
close to losing everything that they'd appreciate
what we have, but no. So there's that. And I'm also representing
one of the families in the Danziger bridge thing. Find the file, read it. I'll get up to speed,
I promise. And what is going on at home, with Sofia, at school,
new house, old house-- I won't bore you
with the details, but I'm not taking on
anything else for the time being.
Got it? Got it. So you say you're
always suing the city? Oh, one thing or another.
I'm late for court, but remind me to tell you
my Harry Lee story. ( Playing music ) Hey, dig the new record, man. I appreciate it, brother.
Thank you. I agree. Really forward-thinking,
great writing, execution. - Cool.
- What've I been telling you, del? Well, she's got to say
that shit to me. So how's New Orleans?
I hear it's going slow. It's frustrating
for everybody, you know. Why? What's taking so long?
Corruption? Bureaucracy? Some of all that, I guess. Do you think it'll ever be the same?
I mean, how can it be, right? Well, look at New York, ground zero.
9/11 changed everything. Right, but that was man-made.
This was a natural disaster. - Well, actually--
- It's apples and oranges. Not necessarily. I mean, people talk
about the slow recovery in New Orleans, but ground zero is still a hole
in the ground five years later. - We're talking about an entire city.
- Right, exactly. New Orleans--
One of my favorite places. - I haven't been since the storm.
- Well, you should go. I mean, it's different,
no doubt, but it's still the same.
You know what I mean? - Mmm.
- Are we talking about New Orleans? Yeah, we were just saying
how different it must be now. Such a beautiful city.
Are the musicians coming back? - Some.
- Are there places for them to play? Not as many, but yeah, they're
coming back too, slow but sure. - Well, are you going back?
- Oh, he ain't going back. He's a new yorker now,
an ex-pat like Wynton... And Harry and Branford
and Christian. That's what I like about your record.
Listening to it, - I wouldn't know you were from New Orleans.
- You wouldn't? She's right. It transcends new
Orleans, like all you ex-pats do. - Transcends?
- Well, maybe "transcends" isn't the right word, but-- And Wynton embodies
New Orleans, by the way. Not necessarily.
I mean, yes and no. Wynton is a curious case--
A deracinated synthesis of New Orleans trad jazz
and big band swing. I don't know what you're talking about,
but I think you just dissed him. Well, let's put wynton aside. You know what I mean about
New Orleans style jazz. Right right, that dixieland
shit, preservation hall. A) It ain't dixieland;
It's trad jazz. B) There's a lot of great
players at the hall. - No doubt.
- Great players. No doubt and no disrespect, but caught in that tourist
economy like a minstrel show. Whoa, "minstrel"--
I don't know about that. - Trapped in Amber though.
- Okay. - It's a living tradition.
- Woman: But you don't play trad jazz. You don't think I call up new
Orleans every note I play? - Well...
- Honestly, no, I don't. Ask Donald, wynton,
any of us-- All tell you the same
thing-- Everything we play, - everything we play--
- Yeah yeah, inflected with the blues; It don't mean a thing
if it ain't got that swing; New Orleans is
a great big gumbo-- We know the rap, the buzzwords. Yeah, I know you guys all feel
like you have to say that shit, but hey, you're here,
not there. I mean, proof's in
the pudding, right? Fuck y'all. Y'all don't know what the
fuck you're talking about. Excuse me. Wow, that went South
in a hurry. I guess I shouldn't have
used the word "minstrel." 496 00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,614 498 00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:25,257 500 00:27:30,063 --> 00:27:32,630 502 00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:37,801 504 00:27:40,972 --> 00:27:43,440 506 00:27:46,443 --> 00:27:50,879 One, two, three!
Hit it! Whoo-hoo! Fucking know-it-all
new yorkers. They were being sympathetic. Fuck their sympathy. Come on, del.
I've heard you say all the same shit
yourself, Mr. Manhattan, about how New Orleans
music is a wax museum, how it's a soundtrack
for tourists. Never dissed the hall.
Never used the word "minstrel." And what the fuck does
"deracinated" mean? You are always talking about how
it's never gonna be the same. I get to say that.
They don't. You sound good on those vocals, man.
You should do more of that. Yeah? You think? The crowd dug it. It was fun. Seems like we were
here the same time last year. At the old point
with the nightcrawlers. Oh yeah.
You gig around a lot. So do you. Ever get old? What else am I gonna do? I hear that. You lead sometimes too, right? That's right--
Sunflower City. How is that-- You know,
having your own group? It's like wrangling cats, but yeah,
it's a rush. It's satisfying. See, that's what
I'm talking about. You start thinking about the
crossroads in your life, you know, like when I picked up the
trombone instead of the trumpet. Man, life would have been
a whole lot different. You ever think about that-- I
mean, with the sousaphone? You ever wish that
you were out front playing the trumpet or a
harmonica or something instead of that big-ass
motherfucker you gotta haul around? ( Laughs ) It crossed my mind. You thinking about
picking up the trumpet? Oh, I'm playing me
some trumpet. I'm thinking about pussy. ( Both laughing ) No, man,
it's too late for that. I'm stuck with this here. Although I do think about all
the pussy I could have got if I played trumpet
instead of trombone, man. Look, you knew I was gonna be
coming back sooner or later. How many of y'all
have been living here? - Just me and him.
- I heard it was more. Yeah, mardi gras.
But George's working on his house. And me and Troy are
staying over by my mom's. Hmm. Look, I appreciate y'all
clearing out so quick. And anytime you want me to open
it up for Indian practice, just-- Just let me know. ( Man singing in Spanish ) ( Song continues on radio ) Hidalgo:
I appreciate this, Coz. I'll catch a cab
back to the hotel. Who you gotta meet downtown? A banker. You know a banker
in New Orleans? Not just any banker. One of the powers
behind the throne, a kingmaker-- CJ Liguori. Coz, Coz, Coz. And you know
this CJ whoever? Let's just say he's a friend of my friends. And he's gonna make you a king? How many kids you have six.
14 to 28; Three grandkids,
maybe another on the way. Keeps me busy. That's what it's
all about, right? You? Not yet. But I come from
a big family-- 13. I'm smack dab in the middle--
Six older, six younger. One of seven myself. Catholic families, huh? My parish in San Antonio
growing up-- Saint Alphonsus liguori. No kidding.
Redemptorist? Of course.
So when I heard your name-- We have a Saint Alphonsus
here too. - You should check it out. It's beautiful.
- I will. Took a beating in the storm,
needs a lot of help. I'm active on
the building committee and the capital campaign. I'd like to be
involved in that. Well, that's fantastic.
I'll have somebody reach out. My mother used to say
we're direct descendants. Of the Saint?
I hope not. Well, you never know.
( Chuckles ) We have other things
in common too. I bring greetings
from governor Perry, speaker Craddick,
Tina Benkiser. Good friends.
Say hello back. I will. You know, we've been
through a lot here. From the little I've seen, I'm
beginning to get a sense of that. We still have a long way to go. Nobody's been through
what we've been through, not in this country, not since
the San Francisco earthquake. But it's an ill wind
that blows no good. You understand what I'm saying? Never let a disaster
go to waste. This is a unique opportunity to put things right,
to fix New Orleans. Crime, schools,
infrastructure-- We've been on the downhill
slide for a very long time. This is a second chance
for this city. You know, at one time we were the biggest
city in the South. Then Houston
and Atlanta and Dallas left us in the dust. Now people say, "why rebuild
New Orleans at all?" Have you heard that in Dallas? A little. I bet you have. But there has to be
a city here. The mouth of the Mississippi--
Has to be a port here. The nation needs it.
The nation needs New Orleans. And there's no reason why New Orleans
can't be a great city once again, why it can't be a great,
modern, 21st-century city. It's an exciting time
to be here. Yes, it is.
Yes, it is. And I hope you're here
to make money, because there is money
to be made. I can't wait to get started. ( Boat horn blares ) What a nice view you got
here-- The mighty Mississippi. That's the west bank. But we're looking east. It's confusing. Huh. 644 00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:23,052 646 00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,459 "Azz azz azz." That'll work. That'll work.
That'll work. 649 00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:37,401 - 650 00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:40,541 - Hey.
- Hey you. Oh, am I glad to see you. Me too. ( Annie chuckles ) McAlary:
Ohh. ( Annie laughing ) How was the tour? It was awesome.
Those guys are so nice. They had me jam with them
during their set every night. - Oh, fantastic.
- Yeah. - They hit on you?
- Perfect gentlemen. Yeah, Magnie and
Malone-- Maybe. Messa is a dog.
Amedee with his beret and the tambourine
shtick-- A chick magnet. Davis? You cleaned for me. Kinda smells like a spring
meadow, doesn't it? ( Laughs ) Yeah yeah. ( Distant dog barking ) Ladonna:
That was nice. Mm-hmm. You're not gonna
turn on the tv, are you? No, uh-uh. Gotta thank your mama. For what? - Taking the boys.
- She didn't want to stay over. She just wanted to check
up on Damo, you know, make sure his grave all right,
to visit with him awhile, go on back to Baton Rouge. Thanks, baby. I like it when you shout. Was I shouting? In the end--
"Oh baby! Oh baby!" ( Both chuckle ) Well, I figured if I stick
with "baby," I'm safe. Mm, long as you think about me. Who else, baby? Now that mama's living with us, you can come down here more. Be alone together
as often as you want. Not like we have any privacy on the weekends
when I'm up there. What time you have to go
in the morning? Not too early. First patient's at 9:00. You want to ride up with me? Gotta open the bar. Ladonna, when are you
gonna come home? I am home. No, this is your mama's home. And she's not coming back. Now we need to sell this place.
We need to sell the bar. I ain't selling the bar, Larry. You got no reason
not to, ladonna, now that she's up there. You're here all alone. You come visit me more
during the week, I won't be here all alone. Oh, now you're changing
the subject. - Mmm.
- No. 713 00:39:17,596 --> 00:39:21,065 715 00:39:24,636 --> 00:39:27,636 717 00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:35,707 719 00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:41,209 721 00:39:43,177 --> 00:39:47,378 723 00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,013 725 00:40:28,368 --> 00:40:33,772 727 00:40:37,776 --> 00:40:40,811 - How long for 14?
- 10 seconds on the cod. You good on the salmon? - Coming up with you.
- Ready on the duck. What about my pigeon?
You got my fucking pigeon? Talk to me. Yes, chef.
Now, chef. - Picking up: One cod.
- One cod. - One salmon.
- One salmon. - One pigeon.
- One pigeon. - Two ducks.
- Two ducks. ( Cooks chattering ) - Man: Are you good on the broth?
- Man #2: Taking it now, chef. Man: All right, let's go.
Put it in e bowl. How many more
do you have all day? Man #2:
Three all day, chef. Man:
Put salt and pepper in it. Man #2:
Yes, chef. Man #3: I got two more
scallops coming up. Motherfucker. Motherfucker! Start again. Table 14:
One cod, one salmon, one pigeon, two ducks. And you think
it might be possible that we can get the ducks right this time, Mr.
Fucking grill man? Do you think that that might be
within the realm of possibility-- That you cook
two duck breasts properly and maybe dress them
before you slice them and not fuck over your
coworkers and my customers by doing miserable,
half-assed, thoroughly unacceptable work? - Can you do that, chef?
- I'm sorry, chef. No no, don't.
I don't want you to be sorry. I don't need that.
What I need is for you to not fuck
with my food again. - Yes, chef.
- Is that understood? Yes, chef. Saucier:
They're walking in-- New table.
Got one scallop-- and the freaking national guard is patrolling our streets like we're fallujah
or something. So you know what? Drop and give me 50,
you fucking fucks. ( On radio ) 770 00:42:37,907 --> 00:42:40,774 772 00:42:45,948 --> 00:42:48,316 774 00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:13,582 775 00:43:13,617 --> 00:43:16,852 776 00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:19,688 778 00:43:21,692 --> 00:43:23,559 780 00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:28,900 782 00:43:33,274 --> 00:43:35,844 784 00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:43,254 786 00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:47,458 788 00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:55,103 790 00:43:58,977 --> 00:44:01,247 792 00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:06,955 794 00:44:08,624 --> 00:44:11,425 796 00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:20,298 ( Applause, cheering ) Thank you.
Hey, that was nice. You sound great, darling. You too.
See you. See you. Y'all were great. He just showed up. I'm not worried. ( Laughs ) I'll say hi. - Hey man.
- What's going on, baby? - Good to see you.
- Hey, daddy-o. Hey, nice job. Thanks, man.
You've been good? Yeah yeah. Hey, I heard you were at
that club the other night. Scared the shit out of me, man. Yeah. Annie seems well. Yeah, she's doing great. She just came off the road, opening for
the subdudes-- A girl and her fiddle. Whoa. Her chops just get
better and better-- Singing too. Yeah, the sky's the limit,
don't you think? Yeah.
Yeah, I do. Well, it's nice
to see you, man. - Take care.
- All right. Take care of her. Yeah, always. ( Speaks Spanish ) Man, they can't understand
a word you're saying. 'Cause they're all from Honduras
and El Salvador and shit. No, it's 'cause your Spanish
is de la chingada. Come on,
I'll take you to lunch. Where did you get
the wheels-- A rental? It's nice, huh?
I'm leasing it. That mean you're staying? Means I'm driving back to Dallas
in style when I go. Where to? A burrito wagon over on claiborne.
It's not bad. Coz, Coz, Coz,
this is New Orleans. The food's supposed
to be great. Come on. A guy
told me about a place. The cops thought
they were being fired on. They were being fired on. Not by the people they shot. And they weren't
being fired on. The only people firing guns
out the were cops. Toni, how n u know that? Terry. All right, fuck it.
You know what? I guess it'll all get
sorted out. ( Chuckles ) Well, thanks for
giving me copies of these. When are you gonna
stop harassing the musicians
on Jackson square? Oh, are we gonna fight
about that too? How's Sofia? Depressed, angry, anxious. Aren't we all? Everybody is
out of their minds. How are yours? Fine, I guess. Whenever I do manage
to get them on the phone, it's always monosyllables
and, you know, multitasking. I can always tell. "Yeah. Uh-huh. Sure, dad. What?" Sounds familiar. It's been six months. Seven. Things getting any better? Worse, I'd say. Talk about it? It was an accident.
That's what she knows. Mmm. Everything okay here? Fantastic. What do you
call this thing again? Frenchaletta. It's our version of a
Muffaletta served on French. Really? Muffaletta, ooh. Got it. Pontchartrain, tchoupitoulas, muffaletta--
I'm learning stuff. Listen, I'll take
the other half with me. All right, I'll get you
a go box, baby. - Thank you, darling.
- You're welcome. Look at this thing.
It's the size of la verga m'ia. I gotta take a picture of that. I love this town.
Why didn't anybody tell me about it before? I've been calling you for the last six
months trying to get you down here. Yeah, but you never said
how great it was. - You just said there was dinero lying in the streets.
- Yeah. Hey, you know a place we can
go hear some music tonight? Coz, Coz, Coz, there's more to life
than money. ( Distant dog barking ) ( Sighs ) How's school? It's all right. Haven't seen any tests
or quizzes recently. Haven't been any. Really? What are you reading
in English? Frederick Douglass's
autobiography. Parent-teacher conferences
are coming up soon. I'm not in for any
surprises, am I? Hmm? Sofia. Are you making friends? Mom, I have the same friends
I had last semester. The school is gorgeous,
state of the art. The teachers are just the
best-- So caring and committed. The student body is so
perfectly benetton diverse, it makes you want to puke. You can take a picture of it
and put it on tv. I just asked a civil question.
I don't need your sarcasm. I'm just saying
status quo, okay? Everything's status quo. If anything changes,
I'll let you know. ( Door opens, closes ) I think this new quarterback looks pretty good.
Hmm. And we know Reggie bush
can bring it-- Heisman damn trophy. Okay? Whoo! This could be our year. - Mr. Riley, Mr. reyes.
- Ms. la Dee. - And who do we have here?
- Ms. Williams, my cousin Nelson. - Oh.
- How are you, ma'am? I'm fine. What'll you all have?
Can I buy you boys a beer? No music tonight? Music? - You said there was music.
- We got a jukebox. - That'll work.
- Have a seat. - Y'all really cousins?
- That's what I said. Look, the jukebox is over here. Thank you, ma'am. Don't be calling me ma'am.
Ladonna. Ladonna?
That's a beautiful name. All right, boys. "El pavo."
Sounds Latin. ( Song starts ) Is Latin. Man: What-- Look at
your boy over there. What? - Man: Yeah!
- Man #2: Check this out. Ladonna: Oh! ( Laughing ) Ladonna: Look at all that
brought up in here. ( Laughing )
Ha! Okay. Okay, all right,
Antonio Banderas. Ahh. That's what I'm talking about. Whoo! I give up. 954 00:52:57,485 --> 00:52:59,652 956 00:53:02,188 --> 00:53:04,154 How do they make this
all go together? It's New Orleans.
We put everything together. You know what gumbo ya-ya
really means? No. Everyone talks at once. 962 00:53:14,861 --> 00:53:17,496 964 00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:22,200 966 00:53:24,904 --> 00:53:26,972 I'll take you to hear the
Klezmer all stars sometime. Ben Ellman-- He plays with them too.
You could sit in. I don't play Klezmer. With them. On fiddle? I don't think so. Fiddle goes with everything. It's like hot sauce. 977 00:53:49,788 --> 00:53:52,390 979 00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,360 981 00:53:57,729 --> 00:54:00,197 983 00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,634 985 00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:09,972 987 00:54:12,442 --> 00:54:14,677 989 00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,848 991 00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,684 993 00:54:27,087 --> 00:54:29,622 995 00:55:01,484 --> 00:55:04,319 ( Playing "I'll fly away" ) How long have you
been playing, man? Two months. It's hard. It'll get easier. Hope so. ( Siren whooping ) Me too.
Me too. L.T. Says I'm early relief
'cause I got court. - Which is bullshit.
- Which is bullshit. If I gotta be in court
till 3:00 or 4:00 every day, then why I gotta come in early? What've you got? Straight up robbery.
Two kids on bikes. She was a little slow
giving up her purse. All right.
Thanks. - Why the lieutenant gotta do you like that, huh?
- Man, fuck if I know. He rides me five times harder
than anybody else on the squad. And I didn't do a motherfucking
thing to deserve it. A couple of my cases
went South last month... ( Robert playing scale ) Kid. You, hey. There's a curfew.
The fuck are you doing? Go home. Sync by n17t01
