 David Logan lives at home with his mother and he's still upset that his father left them many years before. He is haunted by an event when he was twelve years old and he came home to find his father with a blue-eyed blond. He tells his mother he has an appointment at 11:00 so he skips dinner and heads to a bar. There he meets a girl and repeats several times that something big is going to happen at 11:00. He gets into a fight with a sailor in the bar and tells him the same and then again with a patron in an Irish pub, now saying someone is going to die at the prescribed hour. When the 11 o'clock news come on the air, you learn the full story.

 From our sponsor. Davie? Davie? You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Fine. How long have I been asleep, Ma? Only a half hour or so. You should have waked me up. It's late. Man, this heat hasn't let up at all, has it? It'll be cooler later on.

 I ain't complaining, Ma. This heat suits me fine. I've made some iced coffee. Do you want some? No, Mom. It's a funny feeling, to find out that your father is just a person like everybody else. And that he can just pick up and leave like as if... As if nothing here meant anything to him. Oh, please, darling. Please forget it. Let it lie. What are you gonna do, Mom? Stick your head in the ground and make believe that everything is exactly the way it was?

 What happened between your father and me was our business. Not yours. I didn't ask to be a part of it, Ma. I just was. Davie? Davie, where are you going? I got an appointment. But I made supper for us, Davie. What you like. Fried chicken. I'm not hungry. Don't go, Davie. Stay here. Stay here with me. You know, you're not a lot of laughs. What's the matter? Don't you like me? I don't like blondes. Look, you don't like blondes or you don't like me? Now which? What I don't like is blue-eyed blondes. You got brown eyes. Now what have you got against blondes anyway? Everybody likes blondes, don't you know that? I mean, that is a fact. That is what everybody prefers. Not me. How old do you think I am anyway? Oh, I... I don't know. But you're awful cute though, aren't you? Don't get sexy with me, honey. I told you I don't dig blondes. I don't even know why I'm sitting here talking to you. I'm supposed to be celebrating. Hey! Hey! Hey, wait a minute. Listen, is this your birthday or something? What gave you that idea? Well, you... you just asked me how old I thought you were, so I thought maybe this was happy birthday. No, no, it's not... Yeah. How about that? This is my birthday! This is the day I am gonna be born! At 11:00 tonight, I am gonna be born. Oh, you know something? That is a real nice watch. Oh? My father gave me that watch when I was 14. Oh. Hmm... How old do you think I am now? To tell you the truth, I'm not good at guessing ages. You promise to keep a secret? What? Cross my heart. I'm only 17. I'm not even supposed to be in here drinking. That guy could get his license taken away from him. Then why are you? Because I am celebrating! I am celebrating being born. At 11:00 tonight, I get born! Now just listen... What? I don't get you. What's gonna happen? Oh, zoom... I got it, you're gonna take a plane. No plane. Not me. I am gonna be born. Just zoom! And I... Well, I... I could be born all over again. Are you a beatnik or something? No, no. Well, then, why? Why just won't you talk straight? I mean, I just can't keep up with you. Oh, that's because I'm flying. I am flying. I'm flying around in this big dark cavern just waiting for the light to come crashing in on me. Zoom! Zoom! I'll take four bourbons, please. Oh, it's a live American honey. Oh, boy, am I thirsty. Mmm. Hey, tell me, tell me why don't you like blondes. Because she was a blonde. Who? Her. I... Oh, some blonde you used to know, you mean? No. Not exactly that. It was... Not exactly a blonde I knew. No. But she was a blonde. She was what everybody thinks of when they think of a blonde. There she was in the apartment. There he was, too. Who? Him. And I was 12 years old. My mother worked as a waitress because he... He was a piano player. And he worked nights, not so often, not since the band business took such a dive, and also because he drank a lot. Sometimes he'd get maybe 10 bucks for playing a gig, and he'd stop off at Dooly's bar for a few drinks. Then he'd come marching up the street passing out quarters, so that by the time he got to our building, he was broke again. But, man... Everybody on that block loved him. Who are you talking about? Him. I was 12 years old. That afternoon I remember I came home early from school. I came... Walking into the house with my books under my arm and there they were. Him, and that blonde, they... That big blue-eyed blonde. I... I didn't know what to do. I just stood there and looked. She smiled and she said, "Hello there, sonny." So I ran out. Was that your father? Yeah. All fathers are the same. Now what are you letting it get you down for? Getting me down? Where'd you get that idea? I'm just glad I found out about him when I did, that's all. Did you tell your mother? No. Why not? I don't know. I guess I thought he... He would explain it to me later when I came back to the house. But he didn't. That woman was gone. He was sitting alone in the parlor, looking out the window, smoking a cigar. He always had a cigar burning around the house. My mother used to call him the Chairman of the Board. And then he turned to me and he said, "Hello, Davie." And I said, "Hello, Pop." And then I waited. Because I thought he would explain. And then he turned to me and he said, "This is the nicest time of day, isn't it?" "The city is so peaceful this time of day." That's all. Nothing else. And no mention of the blonde? Nothing. And then about two weeks later, him and my mom really had it out, so he left to go to that blonde. And do you know something? He did not even say goodbye to me, his own son. Well, now... Oh, that's no reason for you to hate blondes. Besides, I'm not even a real blonde. How old are you? Oh, now, that... that is the one question you are not supposed to ask. She was 31. What did he do, your father? Nothing. Here, you drink up. Nothing? You've been talking about him all evening. He must have done something. What he done is none of your business. It is too my business. Hey, listen, I'll tell you how it's... Listen, Little Boy Blue, I'll show you it's my business. I was sitting there... You mind your business about my pa. And will you stop pushing me round! Hey! Hey! Hey! Wait, wait. What's all this? This feller bothering you, ma'am? No, he's not bothering me. What's it to you, buddy, huh? I just don't like to see a lady getting bothered. She said she's not getting bothered, so you take a walk, will you? Now mate, you shouldn't ought to... Get that cigar away from me. Wait, wait, you got to watch the way you... Get that cigar away from me! Wait, wait, wait, now look. If you wanna fight, we're gonna go outside, otherwise we're gonna wreck this nice man's old bar all to pieces. You want to go outside now? I'll fight you wherever you say. All right, let's go, let's go. Okay. How about it? Come on. I'm waiting. What you wanna fight for, anyway? I ain't afraid of you. Well now, who said you was? You sure got a hot head, ain't you? Never mind my hot head. Look, mate... Look, you get in a fight with a guy like me, you're liable to get killed. That's the truth. Stop talking, and come try it. Now look, kid, I don't wanna hurt you none, you see. You just got a hot head, that's all. Look, either you give up trying... Wait, wait, come on. What do you wanna fight for, huh? I mean, let's just take a walk and cool that hot head of yours off, huh? Okay? I ain't afraid of you. I know you ain't, kid, I know that. So, come on. Let's shake hands. Huh? Okay. Come on, it's all right. It's all right. You see, not so bad, huh? See? Are you familiar with this city here? I mean, you live around here? Yeah, I live here. Okay, so let's walk. Come on, come on. It's all right. You can show me all the sights. There's not much to see around here. Yeah, give me one frank, will you, please? You want one? One, please. Thank you. Something very important is going to happen tonight. Yeah? And what's that? Did you ever hate anybody? Sure thing, mac. There's a guy I hate right this minute. Who's that? Chief Gunner's Mate on my ship. Man, I hate his guts. I mean... He's always ridin' me. You know, I mean, he's telling me "Do this, you do that." So, you know, I mean, I hate him. I hate him. I, I, I hate him I just hate him. Yeah? Listen. Boy, one of these days, just like I'm standing right here, man, I'm gonna... I'm gonna deep six that louse. I mean, I mean... What do you mean? Well, you know... You throw him right over the side, while we're moving. Drown him, you mean? Yeah, that's exactly what I mean, boy. Kill him? Well, that's uh... Pretty strong there, mate. "Kill" is a mighty strong word. Hmm. Let's just leave it at... Deep six, okay? You hate him that much? Oh, man, listen. I hate him. I hate him more than that, believe me. Listen, I hate him like... Well, as for... Listen, you're the one who asked me. Ain't you never hated nobody before? Yes. Well, all right then, you hate him enough to want to see him dead? Yes. Well, all right then, man. You know just how I feel. I know exactly how you feel. There's only one difference. You're never gonna throw that guy over the side. Oh, how do you know, boy? I know. I can tell just by looking at you. But with me, it's different. Tonight... Yeah? Tonight, somebody dies. Hey, mate, you shouldn't ought to talk that way about somebody dying. Why not? Look, kid, it just so happens, I'm a guy you can trust. But, I mean, you go telling that to anybody, he's liable to get the wrong idea. And you wouldn't want anyone to get the wrong idea, now. What idea is that? I mean, you wouldn't want anyone to think this guy who's gonna die is someone you don't particularly like. I hate him! Shh, mate. Shh, mate! You better watch that stuff, boy. That's just exactly what I was talking about... When it's over, I'm gonna be so drunk, ...you better shush. That they're gonna have to pick me up off the street with a sponge. When he's dead, I'm gonna be so happy. You better cut that stuff out, man! Tom, Tom, wait a minute. Yo. Mate, you better watch who you're talking with, boy. I'm not joking. Wait a minute, Tom. Hey, you want a shine, mister? Good shine. Hey, mister, shine them up? Want a shine? Good shine. There's enough time. What'll it be, sonny? Boilermaker. Would you have a draft card? Yes, I've got a draft card. Can't you tell just by looking at me? Sonny, I ain't Omar the Mystic. Maybe you're 18, and maybe you ain't. But I ain't losing my license for strangers, and showing me your draft card will clear up all doubts. I got it here some place. Oh, go on, George. Give the lad a drink, will you? I can't do that unless he shows me he's of age, and you know that. Will you stop acting like such an old lady, for the love of Mike, and give him a drink? Go on, George. He'll serve you. He always does. Just likes to make a big fuss about everything. Go on, sit down. You know, when a man's Irish, he likes to make a fuss about things. It's... Well, it's part of his nature. I know. Oh, you do? How would you be knowing? My father was from Dublin. Is that a fact? Well, that's where I come from. What's your name, lad? What difference does that make? Well, I just thought I might know your father, that's all. Bartender, bring me another whiskey. You still haven't told me your name, you know. Logan. My name is Logan. Um, well, that's a good Irish name. Uh, what was your father's first name? It don't matter. Well, all right. I just thought I might know him, that's all. Bartender, I thought I ordered another whiskey! What's with you? And leave the arm on, I make my living with it. What do you want, mac? I just wanted to see who it was. Come on, now, come on, lad. Come on, take it easy, will you. Hey, George, it's time for the ball score. Okay. Easy, lad, will you? Easy. What time is it? It's two minutes to 11:00. Say, you're not... You're not gonna do anything foolish, are you? Because that's no way to think, and it certainly is no way to talk. Now, look. Listen to me. Will you listen here to me? Look, put that out of your mind. I'm talking to you as if I were your own father. My own father, huh? That's the guy to sound like, all right. Oh, look, you had a row with your father. Put it out of your mind. Fathers and sons have had rows before. Is that why you're sore at him? Mister, this was no father and son row. This was only a father row. And I'm not just sore at him, mister, I hate him. I hate his living guts and that's why I'm here tonight! Laddy, calm down. Look, there's been a time when most kids hate their fathers. But it passes. It always does. No, you don't know how wrong you are. No, you don't know how wrong you are, mister. All right, all right, lad, look, look. Why don't the both of us have a little sandwich together, huh? How does that sound? I haven't had too much to drink, mister. I kid you not. My father is gonna die. And do you know why? Because his name is Johnny Logan, mister. Do you know who Johnny Logan is? He's a piano player. He's my father and he's the guy I hate. Ossining, New York. John Logan, the so-called Love Nest Slayer, who two months ago killed his blonde girlfriend when he found her with another man, met death in the electric chair tonight at 11:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Saving time. Oh, but it's too soon. Officials said that Logan awaited death in an orderly fashion, requesting a priest, and asking that he be allowed to talk to representative newspaper reporters before the hour of his death. It was assumed that... Shut up! What's the matter with you? Get down. Come on. Now, why did you have to do a thing like that, huh? Because I hated him. I'm glad he's dead. I hated him, I hated him. You know, I liked that story very much. Especially the part where he... Oh, now we have a commercial. That is, you have a commercial. I'm swearing off. Until next week. Good night.
