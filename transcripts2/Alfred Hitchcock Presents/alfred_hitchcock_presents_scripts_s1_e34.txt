 Shared by http://DJJ.HOME.SAPO.PT/ [sighing] Now, that's not it. I'm trying to locate a lost article. The only difficulty is, I can't remember what I lost. No, this isn't it. I don't know why I keep it. I don't think it's any good anymore, it's been used. This is for the man who has everything. It's to enable you to take some of it away from him. By the way, this may take all evening... so while I'm looking here, why don't you look over there.

 Hello. Hi. What are you thinking about? I wasn't thinking about anything, really. I was just wondering... how you could be real and still be so beautiful. Only to you, darling. No. To everyone. You're just prejudiced. No one else ever thought I was as beautiful as you do. What were they using for eyes? Why do we have to wait two more days? Why can't we be married tonight? Oh, darling, that's not too long to wait. It's forever. No. But it will be in two more days and then... forever and forever.

 You know... sometimes when I'm not with you, I close my eyes... and I can't remember what you look like. I wonder why that is. I don't know. I think it's because I'm afraid... that I'm going to lose you. I couldn't live if I did. Oh, darling, you'll never lose me. Why shouldn't I? What did I ever do to get you as a reward? Probably something terrible. Probably I'm a punishment not a reward. Yeah, you're some punishment. We shouldn't be parked here. Why not? We stopped to get something to eat, remember? That's not very romantic. I can't help it. I'm the healthy type. All right, outdoor girl... let's go get a hamburger. Aren't you going to move the car? Move it? Where? There's a parking space over there by the hamburger stand. The car's all right here. Of course, if you're too lazy just to walk across the street.... All right. See how easy I am to get along with? Come on. Let's go. Oh, darn it, I left my bag in the car. It's safe there. I know, but I need my compact. I like you better shiny. Now who's being lazy? All right. You go ahead and order. I want a double hamburger rare, in a hurry. No soul. You're completely dominated by stomach. [tires screeching] [Laura screaming] Laura! ~~[music playing] Laura. Laura. [sobbing] Laura. No. Mr. Edwards. Lt. Shea. I hate to have to keep questioning you at a time like this... but you understand it's necessary. I can't tell you anything. If you can't no one can. You were the only one there. Except the man who killed her. We can't find him without your help. You do want us to find him, don't you? What do you think? If you can just try to remember everything you saw-- I didn't see anything! You said before you saw the license plate. Well, I'm not even sure anymore. Do you think I was... worried about remembering some license plate when Laura was lying there? Sorry, son. I know how rough it is on you. Just one or two more questions, and I'll call it a night. You say you don't remember the color of the car? The make? Look at me, son. Now think a minute before you answer this. The color of the license plate. No... nothing. Okay, we'll call it a night. If anything should occur to you, get in touch with me at headquarters. Would you like one of my men to drive you home? No, I'm all right. Sure. Sorry, son. Good night. Good night. [phone ringing] Hello? Yes, this is Ms. Edwards. I'm sorry. I told you before, my son doesn't wish to speak to anyone. If you'll just give me your number I'll have him call you when.... ~~[humming] [door closes] That man just called again. Did he say what he wanted? No. I don't want to talk to anybody. I know. I've left you alone for a whole week. And it isn't getting any better. How can it get any better? That's right. And you've got to learn to live with it, dear. The world doesn't stop because someone dies, Dana. My world stopped. No, dear. And lying here day after day brooding about who ever was driving-- He's a murderer. He's a murderer. Don't you suppose he knows that? Can't you imagine, wherever he is, what he must be feeling? It's not enough. Dana, I don't know how to say this to you exactly. But you're not special, dear. You're no different from anyone else. And unhappiness and tragedy come to all of us some time. It came to me when your father died. I loved her so much. I know, I know. Why did this have to happen to us? [doorbell ringing] I'll be back. [door closes] ~~[humming] (man) The door wasn't locked... and when no one answered I just came in. Who are you? My name is John Hurley. You're the man who's been telephoning. That's correct. I must talk to your son about the accident. (Ms. Edwards) The accident? Do you know anything about it? Who was driving the car? I've got to talk to your son. Could you tell me? He doesn't want to see anyone. I'm sorry your son-- (Dana) The accident? What do you know about the accident? All I know is what I read in the newspapers. [sighs] I lost my son in the same way, Mr. Edwards. I know what you must be feeling. I appreciate your sympathies, but what do you want here? If I could have a few minutes alone with you, I could explain. All right, Mother. I'll make some coffee. Won't you sit down? What is it? You're young. That's in our favor. Look, I don't mean to be rude or impatient-- But you'd appreciate my getting to the point. Very well, I will. We have something in common. We're both looking for a murderer. Not the same one of course, but that's not important. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm talking about the person who killed your fianc?e. I can help you find him. Are you a detective? No. No, I'm not anything really. I used to teach a long time ago. Now I do other things. How much do you remember about the accident, Mr. Edwards? Nothing. But that's not possible. You saw it. And everything we see is recorded in the mind... whether we're conscious that it's there or not. What good does that do, if I can't remember it? But you can remember it. You saw the license plate, didn't you? I'm not sure. It said in the paper you saw it but couldn't remember it. I'm not sure. I've been sitting around here all week trying remember it, and I can't. Let me help you. How? Have you ever heard of Total Recall? Yes. I can teach you how it works. I can make you remember anything that ever happened to you. If you'll work with me, we'll be able to do it. Do what? Bring back the past. Day by day. We'll start with unimportant days... but eventually we'll get to the day of the accident. You'll relive it, moment by moment... right up to the second you saw the license plate. And then you'll remember it. And when you do, we'll catch a murderer! Why should my remembering it be so important to you? Does it matter what my reasons are? If I can do this for you what difference does it make? I'm not sure. But it can't be just because your son was killed in the same way. What if it isn't? What if I have other motives? You want to find the man who killed your fianc?e. I can make that possible. Will you do it? Yes, I'll do it. I want to find him. No matter who he is. You heard your mother's voice calling. What has that got to do with the accident? I told you before, we've got to go back before we can go forward. We've been going back and back. When are we going to get to the day of the accident? Soon, Dana, soon. Why do you keep avoiding the day of the accident? You aren't ready. Are you sure it's that? Or isn't this something you've worked out not to help me remember... but to make it impossible for me to? Do you believe that? I don't know what I believe. I don't know any more about you now than I did the day you walked in here. Can you do it without me? [sighs] No, I guess not. Then go lie down, and we'll go on. All right. Where do we start? Well, let's take a day... say, the day before the accident. No, I won't do it. I won't go back to that day. Why? What's the matter. I'd have to live it all over again. Yes, but, then it won't be long before we get to the day of the accident. That's why I stopped. I just realized, if I want to know that number I'm gonna have to watch Laura die again. Of course. [door opens] Hello, Dana. Hello, Mr. Hurley. Well, ready to go on? No, it's no use, Mr. Hurley, I'm convinced I didn't even see the license number. You mean you've convinced yourself. Possibly. Not possibly, that's what you've done. You know you saw it. You know you'll remember it if we keep on. Okay. I'm not gonna do it. Would you please get out of here and leave me alone? I haven't wasted all these days to bring you this far and then drop it. I tell you, I don't want to go on with it anymore. That's because there's something blocking your memory... something it hurts you to remember, some guilt. Guilt? Yes, and you've got to face up to it, then it won't be a block any longer. If that's all it is, I don't need you. I don't need to force it. I'll remember it eventually without you. But I want to be here when you do. But why? Because I deserve to be! You couldn't have done it without me. Dana, listen. Listen, Dana... we must go on. You want to find the person who killed Laura, don't you? Don't listen to him, Dana. There's something wrong with him. I don't want to, Mother, but he's right. I have to find him. Then you'll go on? I'll try. Good. Now I think we're ready... to try to remember the day of the accident. All right, Dana. We'll go back slowly. Now relax. Try to relax. Now, start with sonic recall if you can. It's easier. ~~[humming] There was some music. I don't remember the name of it, though. It doesn't matter. Just go back and listen to it. Listen to the music. Then I kissed her and I.... I just sat there for a while, looking at her. She said, "Hello." I said, "Hi." Hello. Hi. What are you thinking about? I wasn't thinking about anything, really. I was just wondering... how you could be real and still be so beautiful. Only to you, darling. No. To everyone. You're just prejudiced. No one else ever thought I was as beautiful as you do. What were they using for eyes? Why do we have to wait two more days? Why can't we be married tonight? Oh, darling, that's not too long to wait. It's forever. No. But it will be in two more days and then... forever and forever. (John) Go on, Dana. Go on. [stammering] I can't remember. Try, Dana, try. Then I said to her... "Darling, I love you so much, but... "sometimes when I close my eyes... "I can't remember what you look like... "why is that?" I don't know. I think it's because I'm afraid... that I'm going to lose you. I couldn't live if I did. Oh, darling, you'll never lose me. Why shouldn't I? What did I ever do to get you as a reward? Probably something terrible. Probably I'm a punishment not a reward. Yeah, you're some punishment. [knocking on door] Yes! Dana, Mr. Shea is here. He said you sent for him. I sent for him. Ask him to wait, please, Mrs. Edwards. I got a message, Mr. Edwards, that you'd remembered the license plate. What is this all about? I left you that message, Inspector. You know, one day, Hurley, you're going to turn up once too often. Please, Mr. Shea, give us a few minutes. Mr. Shea... just a few more minutes, please. All right, I'll give you five minutes. See you downstairs, Hurley. You're almost there, Dana. Go on. Then she said: "Aren't you going to move the car?" Move it. Where? There's parking space over there by the hamburger stand. The car's all right here. Of course, if you're too lazy just to walk across the street.... All right. See how easy I am to get along with? Come on. Let's go. Oh, darn it, I left my bag in the car. It's safe there. I know, but I need my compact. I like you better shiny. Now who's being lazy? All right. You go ahead and order. I want a double hamburger rare, in a hurry. No soul. You're completely dominated by stomach. [tires screeching] [Laura screaming] Laura! [panting] Mr. Shea! There's your murderer, Mr. Shea. There's the license number, Mr. Shea. I finally remembered. Mr. Hurley was right about my mental block. I was feeling guilty, because I didn't go back to the car to get Laura's compact. I was blaming myself for her death. I didn't want to remember, but... Mr. Hurley was right, he made me remember. Will someone please tell me what he's got to do with it? He was determined to help me find Laura's killer because of his son. His son? Yes, the one who was killed by the hit-and-run driver. I don't know what you're talking about. He hasn't got any son, he isn't even married. He's a nut, that's all. He keeps turning up to bother us all the time. He's just a nut. I still can't remember what I'm looking for. If I had only partial recall, it will help. Here it is. At the very bottom of the trunk. I remember now, it's a note I wrote myself. "Remember to clean out trunk." I must remember to do that sometime. And incidentally, here's something for you to remember... while I'm away for the next 60 seconds. Our story tonight... taught us that once you have seen something, you never really forget it. There are times when that can be an appalling thought. One further reminder: I shall be back next week with another story. And unless your license number... happens to be KTY478... I shall see you then. Good night.
