 I'm here at Madison High in Maplewood, New Jersey, where ninth grader Rachel Klein isn't bringing just any date to her school dance tonight. She is bringing singing sensation ChaseDreams. Chase posted he was coming to his 10 million followers so fans from all over the tristate area came out just to catch a glimpse. And it looks like Chase is pulling up now. The fans are going crazy. It's a little scary to be honest.

 He's walking in with his lucky date and what appears to be an old Backstreet Boy. And now a second SUV has pulled up. Did Chase bring some celeb friends? Oh, no. Never mind. It's his parents. And it looks like they had him old. Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com Thank you for coming. This is will be such a special night for the students. Well, Chase is so happy to be here. Oh, my God, that reminds me. I gotta get him out of the wall. - What? - Yeah, I knew the fans out front would be real crazy, so I snuck him in

 through the ventilation system. I think a mouse bit me. That's Hollywood, baby! Oh, my God. Um, Streeter, when you said you were gonna sneak him in I thought you meant like - through the back. - Oh, this is what the hottest celebrities do. They crawl through the walls, and then they have a decoy come in the front. Speaking of which, great job, Lorraine. Hey, if you're happy, I'm happy. Isn't this unbelievable? I found her about two hours ago online. She is a handful, but they're basically the same height. Okay, well thank you, Lorraine. You can just go ahead and wait in the car. Are you sure you don't need me to stick around and play other roles? I'm also an actor. - Oh, no. - I do accents, impressions. I have some costumes in the car. That's okay. Thank you, Lorraine. Then good eve, my lords and ladies. - British. - I could have sworn that was French, but then when she said British I was like, "Yep." Okay, well let's get you two lovebirds out on the dance floor 'cause we gotta be out of here in... 45. - Wait, we do? - Yep. Chase got an invite to the launch party of Lil Wayne's new tequila. I really want to meet him. I mean, Chase wants to meet him. He can't even drink. He's 13. Ages are for regular people, okay? He's a singer. What are we talking about here? Oh, sorry. I gotta take this. It's my agent. Cary, I've got some good news, and I've got some bad news. The good news is I submitted you for the lead in the next Marvel movie. What? That's... That's insane. Thank you, Skip. The bad news is they said that's not the way it works, okay? They don't just take submissions for that. Then why did you call me? I thought you called me. Good-bye, Skip. Okay, buh-bye. Ladies, can I interest you in a new kitchen? Okay, okay, here's what we're gonna do. Chase and Rachel, you're gonna dance to exactly five songs. While they're doing that, Streeter and I are gonna pass out merch. Oh, wait till you see what it is. - Streety crushed it. - I bet he didn't. Then, Chase is gonna take pictures for 20 minutes. Anybody who posts one should use the same hashtag. - Chom. - What? Chom. It's a combo of Chase and Prom. Okay or since it's not prom, - why don't we do #DreamDance? - Boo. And when is he doing his live performance? Oh, uh yeah, we got some bummer news on that front. C.D. has to be in the studio early tomorrow morning so he is on strict vocal rest. No singing. Not talking. All night. Then why did he come to this? No, no, no. No, it's gonna be great. He's gonna lip-sync. No one's gonna be able to tell. Streeter said he figured the whole thing out. Yeah, I'll take care of the singing. - Excuse me? - Ah! God, who's that? That's Chase's date. You rode here with her? Can we go dance now? Hang on, hang on. Just, uh... we talked about the... Then we went through, um... Yeah, I think we're good. Yeah, you can go. Go have fun. Come on. Go, go, go. Have fun quickly. Run, bitch! Sorry. Sorry, sorry. She's new. What up, Madison High! Is everyone having fun tonight? Special shout-out to Rachel and ChaseDreams. - You guys having fun? - Whoo! You know it! Keep going, everybody. Hey, thanks for being my date tonight, Car. Yes, of course. Yeah. You want to hear something sad? This is my tenth high school dance with a girl. Aw. I mean, at least you got to go to dances. - I was already in New York. - Oh, yeah. They didn't have dances at that school? No, we studied dance. We didn't, like, do dances at night too. Mm. What would you do? Drugs, Cary. Ah, yeah. Hey, cool hair. - You sing? - No, I play soccer. Perfect. Okay, athletes make the best singers. Meet me in the library in 20 minutes, and, uh, bring your ball. - Hi, you're a music manager? - Yes. So, what did you think? I think you can make an excellent veterinarian. Okay, here's a fun thing. Which one of these kids were you at 14? Oh, my God. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Oh... No brainer. - That one. Fun, confident. - Yeah. Dress fully tucked up into her asshole. She's living. - Well, there's me. - Aw. - That is definitely me. - Oh, yeah. Oh, n... never mind. And, damn! Hi, I'm Elijah. Are you CaryDreams? - Uh... - Yes. - Yes. - Yes, he is. Do you want to dance? Sure. Yeah. Yeah, buddy. Just promise you'll never hurt me. Oh, uh, I promise. Hi. We have a problem. Ugh, what did Streeter do? Nope, it's your brother. He's in the bathroom with some boys smoking. He is? Oh, sh... Thank you. You know I want to be in the industry too. - Like, an actor? - No. I want to run Hollywood. I'm gonna sit on the top floor of a very tall building and be in charge of everyone. Oh. Cool. Excuse me, sir. You have a phone call. It's 9-1... 1, yeah. They called you. - It's an emergency. - Oh. - Thank you. - Uh-huh. Sorry, Elijah. Very good lie. So real. I know. Sorry, I panicked. Okay, I gotta go do rounds. Just walk around the school and make sure kids aren't having sex. Do you... wanna come? Oh. Yeah. Cool. I'm Jeremy by the way. Hey, Cary. Oh, my God. Chase, what are you doing? This is... Lorraine? G'day mate. Australian. Why are you not in the car? I was just telling these boys about my favorite acting role. I was an extra on the pilot of "ER." If I think about that for too long I could cry. I was also this close to being an Olympic skater. But my mom wouldn't buy me skates. Lorraine. Car. Now. I can't believe you're the drama teacher. Ours was so old. I was like, thir..ty. Oh. Whoa. Yeah. Our teachers were not old. - Oh, God. - Let me guess. You were the lead in all your plays too? You know it. Yep. No, our theater program was actually really good, so. Okay, no offense, but literally every high school play is bad. Even the good high school plays are bad. No, no, I mean we did "Fiddler on the Roof" and I think if I saw it now I would still think it was good. Did you play Tevye? - Yeah. - So you were a gay child playing a 40-year-old Russian peasant? Yes, but... but I think I pulled it off. - You didn't. - Oh, my God. No high school kid ever has. No, you're right. I had braces. What? - Hey, break it up. - It's teachers! - It's Mark and Diane! - Oh, sorry, guys. They're trying to have a baby. Oh, that's sweet. Sorry, I just need to know where you are at all times - for your safety. - But Rachel wanted... Shh, no talking. Just... just dance. The swag has arrived. "The swag baby, yeah." Why are you doing Austin Powers? What do you mean? Okay, let's just pass these out. What'd you get, like T-shirts or...? Are these surge protectors? Okay, here's the thing. So last week I was ordering 10 surge protectors for my house, and I accidentally typed in 1,000. Why did you need ten for your house? Well, you can never have too many surge protectors. I guess you can? Whatever, just go. Pass... pass them out. So, Rachel, is it a dream come true to be dancing with Chase? - Yeah, he's a great dancer... - Okay, that's great 'cause you have 20 more seconds. Chase makes your electric. Hold on to that. Stay plugged in, all right? Chase wants you to have this for your electric. What is this crap? Oh, bad boy. Meet me in the library in ten minutes. And stay mad. So were you out in high school? Um, yeah. - Tenth grade. You? - Hm. Uh, senior year of, um, college. - Oh, ew. - I know, I know, I know. - College? - Yeah, it's very late. - But, um... - No, to each their own. No judgement. Wait. What play are you guys doing? I don't want to tell you. I mean, it looks like "Grease" on Mars? - That's literally what it is. - Are you serious? Every couple years the kids beg me to do "Grease." So I've done "Grease" in World War II. - "Grease" in a women's prison. - Oh. And now "Grease" on Mars, baby! You've done a great job. - Hey, break it up! - It's teachers. - It's Tom and Lisa. - Oh. Sorry. Are they trying to have a baby, too? - No, that one's an affair. - Oh. What up, what up? Big announcement! ChaseDreams is now taking photos for the next 20. Oh, don't forget to use the #DreamDance. I thought it was chom. That's what my surge protector says. - It does? - Yeah. In really bad handwriting. What is that man doing tonight? Okay, kids. You are now... a boy band. Huh? Ha-ha! You're the bad boy, you're the hot one, you're the pirate, you're the gay guy. - You gay? - No. - Any of you guys gay? - No. Okay, congrats. You're the gay one. And you're... the dud. All right. Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life. And I will be right there by your side. When you laugh, I'll laugh. When you cry, I'll cry. And when you dance, I'll watch you dance. So what do you say? - Pass. - No thanks. I just want to go dance. Do any of you have any younger brothers? Okay, I've been asked to announce we have another celebrity here taking pics. Apparently she was in "ER." It also says she can drive stick? God damn it. It's so pretty out here. Makes me wanna go to a football game. Makes you want to sit and watch a full football game? No, no. I guess it just makes me wanna watch "Friday Night Lights." So how long have you lived out here? Uh, pretty much right after NYU I got this job. I just never wanted to do the whole working actor thing and still be waiting tables at age 30. Totally, yeah. Oh, no. Do you wait tables? - Yeah, yeah. - Ah, shit. I didn't literally mean waiting tables. - That's just the cliché thing you say. - No. No, no, no. It's fine. I'm literally living the cliché thing you say, so... And action. Why are you not in the car? This young man wants to be an actor too. Anyway, I'll never forget what Geena Davis said to me on the set of "Stuart Little." "Either you go or I go." Lorraine. I will give you $100 if you go sit in the car. Whoa. That's ten times more than what I got paid to come here. You did this for $10? Well, $5 after taxes. $4 after my agent. $3 after my manager. So $3. $3. You should go to law school. You know, I think I could actually live here. Whoa. This is moving a little fast. Oh. No, I didn't mean, um, - here here, I just meant... - Dude. Chill. Okay. Uh, it's teachers. - You bitches! - Oh, no. How? How could you do this to me? Elijah, go back to the dance, please. Stay out of this, Jeremy. Haven't you done enough for one night? Again, you need to call me "Mr. Delongpre." And you... I told you my dreams. We danced together. Did that mean nothing to you? I don't know how to answer that. Typical. Good-bye, Cary Dubek. But just tell me one more thing before I go. Was that really 911 on the phone for you? No. Wow. What up, what up? It's the moment we've all been waiting for. He's got hundreds of millions of views on YouTube and tonight he's performing live with a song that made him famous. Give it up for ChaseDreams! - Sorry again he's lip-syncing. - That's okay. Did the DJ have the right track for him to sing to? I'm assuming so. Streeter said he was taking care of the singing. Oh, no. I am so sorry for what's about to happen. ♪ Girl, since the age of ten ♪ ♪ I knew that I would spend ♪ ♪ My whole life with you ♪ ♪ 'Cause, girl, you're the cutest girl ♪ ♪ In the entire world ♪ - Excuse me. - ♪ I would die for you ♪ ♪ 'Cause when we are together ♪ ♪ I can play forever ♪ Hey, Brooke. ♪ My friends think I'm crazy ♪ ♪ But I'm thinking maybe ♪ ♪ I wanna marry you at recess, uh-huh ♪ ♪ Girl, I wanna fight for you, I wanna cry for you ♪ ♪ I wanna... ♪ ♪ And together chase dreams! ♪ Okay, that's it. Thank you so much. You guys have been so great. I'm so happy to be here. But I have to go. I'm gonna meet Lil Wayne. Can you believe it? Lil Wayne! Okay, well, I am so lucky. Thank you. Goodnight. How do you think that went? You told me you were gonna have him lip-sync. - We did. - I thought you meant to like a track. But we promised a live performance. - What? - Hey, Brooke, - we're leaving now? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're done. You can go sit in the car. - And don't talk. - But I wanna dance. - These kids are fun. - Oh, I'm sorry, bud. But, you know, you'll have plenty of dances to go to - when you get to high school. - I'm not going to high school. I already graduated on Streeter's phone. - Yeah. - Oh, no, that was... - That was just the eighth grade. - No. He went through the whole high school too. I mean, this guy tore through the app. He's a smart little dude. Ah! Hey, why don't you go say good-bye to your date, and then we'll meet Lil Wayne! No. No. He's not going to that. He's staying here. Oh. No can do, chica. I mean, I burned a lot of bridges to get that invite. So it'd be poor form if he didn't show up. Well, he's not gonna show, so why don't you do your job for the first time tonight and figure it the fuck out! Whoa. Who's that? That's my sister. Yeah, Dur. I meant the guy in all white - with the Kangol. - Oh, that's nobody. Okay, boss, I, uh, hear you. I admit I had a few missteps tonight. But I think there's one thing that we can agree that I did not mess up and that's Lorraine. Her entrance was perfect, and she's been sitting out in the car all night just like we asked her too. So... here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna have Lorraine come to the tequila party, put on sunglasses and a hoodie, and Lil Wayne will never notice, and then Chase can have his night off. Streeter, that's... That's an amazing idea. I'm sorry I yelled at you. You really... you saved the night. Thank you. No. Thank you. And I promise I will... I will not mess up again. - Okay? Okay. - Okay. Take the night off. Uh-oh! Somebody's hooking up tonight! You really think that's gonna work? No, she's a 50-something-year-old woman. But this will buy us a few hours. Whoo! Driver take us to Lil Wayne. God, it's uncanny. Not to be too whatever, but it was nice that you were here tonight. There's never any gay guys at these dances. All the teachers are straight. Oh, yeah, that sucks. Well, the science teacher's gay but he's 82. - Oh. Yeah. - And the sex was terrible. So, this is where kids go after dances? I think just the losers. Well, where do the cool kids go? I don't know. I was a diner kid. Aw, right. It's so peaceful out here. Yeah. Makes me want to kill myself. What? No, it's nice. It's sweet. I wish I had the kind of brain that could be happy living here, but then I wouldn't be able to read. Jeremy lives out here, and he has a normal brain, I think. Maybe I should just quit and move somewhere like this. My life in New York is not that great. I'm a waiter and I basically live in a closet. Okay, well I literally live in a closet, so let's not be rude. Also, Cary, being a waiter is temporary. What if it's not? I'm 28 and I just shot a commercial where I smell a fart. I feel like if I was gonna be a famous actor it would have happened by now. Maybe I just missed my wave. Oh. - You are so dumb. - What? - Chase is your wave. - Ew, no. He could be. Cary, I'm gonna say this with love. You are not above all of this. - I know I... - I just... I feel like you had this romantic vision of how this whole thing was gonna play out for you, and sometimes it just doesn't happen that way. It happens in a million weird ways. Maybe Chase is your weird way. - Oh, my God. - What? Lil Wayne just posted a picture with Streeter and Lorraine. No. "I love ChaseDreams. This Lil dude wrinkly as hell. #chom" - Oh, my God. - Well... Is Streeter actually a genius? Hey, are you guys with ChaseDreams? - Yes. - Yeah. ♪ And your keys, oh ♪ ♪ Your ring of keys ♪ That was beautiful. But we can't really do anything. - Okay, so Sandy is a human? - Yeah. Yeah, and then Danny's what? He's an alien? - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh, okay, yeah. And then instead of Rydell High they go to... - Mars High. - Mm-hmm, yeah. Well, yeah, seems like you really cracked it. I love doing intros. Hi! Hello, welcome to The Other Show. - I'm Chris. - I'm Sarah. And we're the creators of The Other Two and we're here talking about episode five with Ken, and Helene and Drew. Well, and this episode was directed by... - Oh, Mike Karnell, my husband. - Wow, her husband, wow. - At the time he was your fiancé. - That's true. Yeah, we shot this episode days before your wedding. Shot this episode, left on the next day to go down to where we got married. Got married that following Sunday. - Consummated the marriage. - The following Saturday. Cconsummated it. And then we went on a scout on Thursday the next week. It's so pretty out here. Makes me want to go to a football game. Makes you want to sit and watch a full football game? No, no, I guess it just makes me want to watch "Friday Night Lights." I feel like a lot of the show is you trying to measure yourself against your little brother or other people or am I doing well enough or am I doing well enough fast enough? Isn't that the question we all ask ourselves all the time? Yeah, hopefully going back to the high school helped bring that to a boil, sort of, I guess especially for your character, for Cary. And even for Brooke since she didn't get to go to high school really, she didn't have a typical upbringing. But I went to dance school and did drugs. But in the writer's room, we would say like, okay and this scene will be on the football field at night. And the writer's room would be like "For why, what happens there?" And we'd be like, we don't know but there's a big wide shot of a football field. I mean, we did Fiddler on the Roof and I think if I saw it now I would... I would still think it was good. Did you play Tevye? Yeah. So you were a gay child playing a 40 year old Russian peasant? Yes, but I think I pulled it off. In the writer's room we were talking a lot about like roles that you, at the time, were like... "This is crazy that I was cast as this, "but I was actually very good." 'Cause, no, you weren't. I still think I was pretty good in everything, so that never happened to me. Well, you've done Broadway, so you probably were good. I played... in ninth grade, I played Daddy Warbucks... In ninth grade? In ninth grade I didn't want to shave my head and so I was like "I'll wear a bald cap", we glued it on so I didn't, like you could feel the pressure, you could feel, you didn't want to rip it. So I would... I did the whole play like I had a neck brace on. In the moment that year, were you like... "I'm getting away with this, this bald cap works." Or did you know this was pretty rough? I was terrific. Yeah, you were terrific, you were terrific. At least I thought I was. I don't want to stop our conversation, but we do have a superstar in our midst. Because you won a very - important award in high school. - Thank you, yep. - So just let's throw focus to her. - What was the award? Well, in high school, in 1999, I won best actress in New Jersey. - Wow. - Wow. - What Sarah? - At a theater festival. Best actor in New Jersey was also in our play, and so was the best supporting actress because our drama teachers ran the festival. Okay, well this was not told to me backstage. So I do think it was real, I do think it was real. Edit out my set-up. This is not what was told to me. Cool hair, do you sing? No, I play soccer. Perfect, okay, athletes make the best singers. Meet me in the library in 20 minutes, and bring your ball. I was telling you this story, which is, it was a very pivotal moment in my deciding to dive deeper into being an actor. I played sports and I was in plays in school, and I would do both. The varsity coach cornered me in the locker room and he was like "Marino," and I was like "Yeah?". And he goes "You gonna play basketball this year - "or do that fag acting?" - Oh. And I was like... "I'm gonna do the acting" and then that was it. I didn't play basketball that next year, and I just... It was like... And I still remember that and that was, you know, many, many years ago. - Yeah. - But I remember that moment and the decision of being like... We were talking about it. - Yeah, it's a thing about, yeah... - It's a thing that drove... that, you have these moments - of people who inspire you... - Yeah. Or people who say things that like, infuriate you and motivate you to dig deeper into it. But that's cool that that made you be like, - that didn't make you be like, - I'm going acting. "Oh, I don't want to seem like a fag, I'll do basketball. - You were like fuck him, I'm gonna... - Exactly. I guess it's probably cause you weren't gay. I was gay, so I'd be like "No, I 'm playing basketball." I love basketball. - Fucking fag... - I'm quiting. So, this is where kids go after dances? I think just the losers. Well, where do the cool kids go? I don't know, I was a diner kid. You guys have fun high school dance stories? I only went to dances with gay men. Yeah, that sounds about right. So, yep, I went to theater school, so did you. Went to dances with gay men and I'm thriving. Right around the time that we were going to prom, I had a high school boyfriend and we were very serious about each other. And we both were like in musicals and plays and whatever together. And we each wrote a song for each other and then we snuck into a church and played them for each other and sobbed. That is... - That is adorable! - Is he gay now? - No. - Amazing. By the way, it sounds like it's from "Dawson's Creek." I didn't kiss a boy throughout all of high school cause I was in the closet obviously and then my first kiss with a boy, I came out to one of my friends from high school in my freshman year of college. I AOL instant messaged him and I was like "I'm gay" and then he was like "Me too." And then so the next time I was in my hometown, we met up, we were like, well... I don't think we're gonna be together but should we kiss each other since we've never kissed? So I made us drive to a half-built home. - What? - It was half-built, I drove us there. And then I kind of location scouted, I was like, I think this room's big enough, I can sit down onto a step. And we made out there and it was great. You produced your first kiss? Yeah, I did. I guess as an outro, I'll just say... Hi, Eric. That was a great night. And watch our next episode. Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com
