 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Mikhail? You've grown up, Yuliy. I knew I wasn't mistaken. So it is you, brother. Why did you go without saying anything then? It was impossible. When we find a Jaeger, we must kill it. That's the rule in our Vampire world. Mikhail, you're a Vampire after all. Yeah. I'm not supposed to be here now.

 You must have noticed my smell. Well, I'm not entirely trusted by them. When I shot you, I was ordered to kill you. The last thing I wanted was to kill my dear little brother, so I avoided your vital spots. Aren't I good? Why? I thought you didn't use guns, Mikhail. Oh, I taught you how to hunt long ago. That's right, I told you not to use it because it would make your nose useless... though that doesn't concern me anymore since I've become a Vampire. Yuliy, why did you become a Jaeger? For vengeance, of course. I'll kill every single one of the bastards who robbed us of our mother and tribe. I see.

 You're a Jaeger, and I'm a Vampire... At this rate, we'll have to kill each other eventually. I thought you were already dead. But I was finally able to meet the only living family I have... and you say we have to kill each other. I don't know how to answer that. Then I'll say this as your big brother... Yuliy, stop this vengeance now. Iba, entering. Major general. -Please stay here until the next station. -Yes. When we get there, we'll have you contact your parents. Yes. I'm sorry. Miss? Why are you on this train? No-- No. Well... these. Would you like to have these together? Stop this vengeance? What do you mean, Mikhail? I can tell by looking in your eyes... The role of avenger is far too much for you. An avenger's eyes are full of anger, hate, sadness, and despair. Your eyes are just those of a spoiled brat. That's not true. I have lived only to kill Vampires. Then why don't you kill me? After killing every single Vampire besides me, are you going to kill me last? That's... Now, hurry up and kill me. Without a minute or a second to lose, you want to kill as many Vampires as you can, right? Then now is your best chance. I won't resist. What's the matter? It's all right now, Yuliy. You can't become completely cruel. Forget about it already. About me, Dogville... and Mother. And about the Ark. The Ark? But if you again appear before me as a Jaeger, you will no longer be my brother... You will be my enemy. What an awful scar. Iba, I'd be satisfied if it were you who tells me that I am finished. Please don't say such odd things. What happened exactly? I received a report there was an accident at the drill in Fuji-- It was no accident. It was... It was a one-sided massacre. Massacre? I let a great many men die. I assume they were going to experiment on us from the beginning. They? Meaning the Alma Trading Company? We walked right into their trap. We shouldn't have gotten involved with such a monster, one made in such an abominable way. Sir, what is it exactly? It must not be brought into the Imperial Capital. Something must be done. It can't be... It's being transported on this train? Master, our prey is in sight. It's heading towards us. Let's go. It's time to hunt! You're quite an active young lady, chasing after a sweetheart. Not a sweetheart! That's-- That's not it. I was just worried about Yuliy. Yeah, hence he is your sweetheart. That's not-- Yuliy doesn't know the difference between love and pain. I think it'll be difficult to make him yours. No, it's not like that. Besides, you and Yuliy live in entirely different worlds. That's it! That's also what worries me. Is Yuliy...? Are all of you working on something dangerous? Miss... Well, why don't you bring that lunch and ask Yuliy yourself? Please don't change the subject-- What happened? That is... I am The Hyakko Party leader, Naotora Momose. For the greater cause, we will take possession of this train! The Hya-- Hyakko Party! -Why did we stop? -Call the conductor. -It can't be. -It's all right. -Excuse me, sir! -What is it? Pirates claiming to be The Hyakko Party have raided us. Hyakko Party? Why them? Currently, the on-board soldiers are engaging the enemy to contain them. Protection of civilians is top priority. -Don't let them near the passenger cars. -Yes, sir. Major Iba, I'm sorry but can you join the guards -and assist the tactical command? -Yes, sir. I will assist the tactical command, sir. -Hurry! -Please don't push! -Let's go! -Get out of the way! Dorothea, what is this? Leave the rest to us and flee with the others! What's the matter? A half-wit shot like that won't hit me. You need to aim better! Let's begin. The Hyakko Party stated social reform as their grand slogan... but they were just a gang of thieves after all. Even if you are Mr. Yevgraf's favorite, don't just move around as you please. This mess... It's your fault for only cutting off financial aid, and doing nothing more. The Jaegers are here too. Inferior and foolish humans. Just like hyenas. No. Wasn't there a wolf too? Let's leave this up to Klarwein. Mikhail, why don't you use those claws and fangs once in a while too? Damn! They'll take over the freight car! -Don't let them into the passenger car! -Go! That's where we need firepower! Don't spread out. Stay together and move along the train! Search for Kershner. He must be on board this train, with the treasure. Master! What is it? What is this bizarre armor and helmet? This can't be the new weapon they were talking about. -It moved. -Is it alive? Is it mechanical? This is truly interesting! For such monsters, they've created quite a tasteful thing! All right, start the train and search for Kershner! Find him and tie him up. -Make him bow down before me! -Sir! All right. Let's scram! -What's going on? -What's happening? Yuliy... Miss, hurry and get off the train. Hurry! I'm sorry! Major, sir! -We're headed in the wrong direction! -What? Are they trying to steal the entire train? Slaves! -Ume, hurry! -Ume! Are you okay? -Thank you, big brother. -Ume! Mom! Brother. Yuliy. But if you again appear before me as a Jaeger... you will no longer my brother. Even then, I... Fire, fire! Don't let them advance any further! Don't back down! Show them our Samurai pride! -Hey! What is that? -Something serious is happening. Fallon, follow that train. Hurry. Roger! -This is great! -Master. It defended us from them. The thing is adorable. What's wrong, comrades? Now, stand up! With this, restoring our rights -as former Samurai can be easily achieved. -I guess it's showtime. Now, monster! As my servant, wreak havoc as much as you desire! The Showa Restoration is right in front of us! Master has been killed! Master? Hey, what do we do? What do you mean, what do we do? -Hey, no one's there. -What? Will the train stop if we leave it be? Damn. The tires are screwed. What on earth is going on? Dorothea? You must be mistaken. Trust me, I know my crew! This is not good. There's a dead end up ahead. And a downward hill continues towards it. -That's... -Fallon, I'll take the wheel. Join Dorothea's group and stop the train! Dorothea! What the hell kept you? You're so mean. -I'll cut off the rear passenger cars. -You got it. Nice job. Enormous strength! Yuliy? Yuliy. Stop the train. There's a dead end up ahead! What a reckless thing you're all doing! You're the reckless one. Meeting you here must be some kind of fate. Please let me help too. Brother. I thought I'd never see you again. Even then... Even then, I always... I wanted to see you, Mikhail! It's not a Vampire? But it smells just like them. I have things to do up ahead. If you won't get out of my way... -Major, sir. -Retreat for now. Join the soldiers in the back. You're that intruder from the other day. You... What? Do you know each other? He's a newspaper man who's snooping around about us. Hey, now. Why is a newspaper man carrying a gun? It's for protection. -Necessary when chasing a dangerous story. -Major! Watch out! Miss. I've killed someone... It's all right. It's not human. What? See? According to the 7-year-old daughter's testimony, the Professor turned into glowing ash and disappeared. It can't be... If you're a reporter, won't this be a better story? What on earth is this? Never seen one? It's a Vampire. Vampire? How lucky I am to be able to gather combat data against a Jaeger here! What? Oh, no. No! It won't stop! After all that I said, you still came? Really, you always have chased after me. Mikhail? So you can't be stopped anymore... I'll put you out of your misery right now. Yuliy. If-- If I become like him too... I want you to kill me. What do you mean, kill you? If you have the Ark... If you have the Ark of Sirius, you can do it. You can spare a life or take it. That means... Brother. Ten years... That's quite a detour. But compared to the next 1000 years... or better yet... eternity, it was only a moment. EPISODE 5 THE FRANKENSTEIN A way to live without vengeance. Damn. For the army to meddle... -In time of need, I'll be bait. -What? -Yuliy wants to quit as a Jaeger? -I'm your opponent! EPISODE 6 MOCKINGBIRD'S SONG Subtitle translation by Haruna Saito
