 - No. - Father of success. No. Where are the dark circles? It's just a stupid article. Shut up. It went well. - We're in a hurry. - A little. - Are we going to run the disease? - Christian, not now. My eyes are getting tired. Stop this. No, what's the problem? Now they're closed. Can speak now! A woman open the car door. - I'm going to dodge. - No, no! - Tell me. - Car in the opposite direction. Right in front Two girls running. Brake. - Only if they do not stop. - Brake, damn it! Made you scream. - You're crazy. - You're so angry. You'll be fine, dear. Let's go. How am I? Like someone who wants to be a bishop. I would like. - Why do not you come in? - I bother. Drive a car with the eyes closed, but he does not dare to see his father. We see. We do not need a church that seeks desperately the public. Should the priest spend your time on hip hop festivals and baptisms of furry critters? If the faithful want new ways of religious service, have the right to do so. We listened to the candidates. Now the turn of the questions. Yes? The society ate sta is op e position of the Church. Encourage people to renounce the Church. What's the f for you? Yes. What do you believe in? That's a very good question. Do we have time for this? "Probably," I said. "I'd like to respond." Here we have four candidates for bishop ... and we do not have time to respond, in what we believe. No, we do not want to. We do not have time The Church is under pressure. Only 57% of the population of Copenhagen belongs to the church. - 57.6% to be exact. - 57.6. Ladies and gentlemen. I believe in the Church. But the question , if the Church believes in itself. Lau Hedegaard, You were out and said ... atheists intimidate the faithful of the Church. "They are harassing the Church." Let's get into the game instead to lower our heads. If the society here calls the people to leave the Church, Let's call the atheists to participate. To join the discussion of great questions of life. Let's hear what they say ... for someone who is seeking the meaning of life. What they say? "It does not make sense." Or what they say to a man Who is afraid to die? "Do not worry, only in the first time the worms bite. " Or the person who Are you afraid to live? "Take a pill of happiness." We simply need ... be together! I believe in God. And say this more controversial to tell them when I had sex last time. That I will not tell you. But to say "I believe in God" ... Something very intimate, right? I know that the ... modern people need to believe ... need to think or feel things which can not be measured. For example music. A moment of poetry. The yearning of a loved one. The love of a child. Or the help that suddenly receives, when the earth opens under your feet. The great mystery of life. All of God, of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. And in all this I believe ... and accordingly I live my life. Thank you. Good Morning. Good Morning. Good, there's tea too. I think we have a Robin in our parents garden.

There must be room for everyone. - Johannes? - Yes, talk a lot. Otherwise, we talk to the extremists. - You agree. - I'd like to complement. Johannes, in the spring, you wrote an article in the Christian Newspaper in which he expressed in a tone much more pronounced on Isl . Now, according to with your response, understand that changed your position?

Much of it identical to a Stockholm thesis last year. And a review shows that 50-60% of your thesis ... identical to this. - I do not understand. - It's a very serious matter. You may end up with an expulsion. But I can rewrite this, what you think was copied. - No. - No, not once. We'll call you. - It's all over the internet. "The Christian newspaper speaks well. There is an excellent Pastor Nicolaisen, who supports me. Politiken calls you "The Danish Inquisition". Serious? I can see? Which one? 621, 591. I draw everyone's attention. The votes now are accounted for and are distributed in the following way: Six hundred twenty-one against five hundred ninety one In the diocese of Copenhagen, the next bishop will be: Monica Ravn. Parab ns. Parab ns. Dear. You have to congratulate Monica. Just congratulate her. - Congratulations, Monica. "Thank you, Johannes. We have to take a picture. Johannes, come on. Johannes, come on.

I complained about the thesis. You lied, dammit! What are you thinking? We're starting a business. What image will we give if the thesis of one of us is a fraud? - Mark, let's have some coffee. - I have to go. I have to defend my thesis. You should do this, already wrote it. What is Christianity?  Why are we in the Church?  We are in the Church ... because it is a designated place to the great moments of life. The happiest. Or the saddest. Those of greater debt. Here is space for all emotions. That is why ceilings are so high. We need space. See you ...  - Hi. - Very good sermon. Thank you. It's cool that people like to come. Come to you. You are popular. You're good at putting together a great hearing both in church ... social networks and the press. A clear and eloquent voice. One of the parents of Marmorkirken will retire.
