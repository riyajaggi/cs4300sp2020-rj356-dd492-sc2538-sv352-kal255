 and I was a douche for leaving you out there, and I shouldn't have taken the piano, but we can't leave it here. - We have to. - Nonononono... Lucky, look. I'm, sorry, okay? But you can't do this. It's your Gran's piano. you have to take it to Perth. Why? I don't fucking know why, but that's the whole point, isn't it? That's the whole point! - Hi. - JIM: Where are you heading? Kalgoorlie? Ah, we're camping in Norseman tonight. Norseman's perfect. We love Norseman. - JIM: Ah, well. Hop in! - Thank you! - LUCKY: Come on! - No. JIM: Are you coming? - Yeah, no, we're coming. Meg! You have had two car accidents, you have a fractured radius... - OK, at least half of that is your fault. - Meg... Can you stop saying "Meg" like that? You sound fucking ridiculous. I am responsible for you. - No you're not! - Yes I am. Until I get you to your mum's house, I am your guardian. Bullshit. - JIM: So what's the verdict? - We're coming! We're going. Sorry about that. Teenagers... [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] - You like the music? - Fantastic. MEG: You're a liar. I don't understand you. JIM: So! You're hitch-hiking to Kalgoorlie. - Perth, actually. - Good way to meet people! A normal person would've booked a flight. Weeks ago. A normal... well-adjusted adult person wouldn't have tried to drive a piano across the desert. Would they? - JIM: What's in Perth? - My family. JIM: Family's important. My mum's dying. Oh... sorry. Quite soon, we think. We'll pray for her. That'd be perfect. Thank you. - Actually, could you plug my phone in? - BEV: Of course. Just... out of battery.

What the fuck are you doing here? - Put the hockey stick down! - It's 2 o'clock in the fucking morning! What are you... Why are you here? Well, I was out with the girls, and I'm too pissed to drive home, and Toby's away, of course. 'cept you're here. Why are you here? [POURS GLASS OF WATER] I broke up with Steph, and she kicked me out of the flat, so... I never liked her much anyway. No, me neither. God, that tastes good! Mm? You serious? Maybe we should hear from the back seat. What do you do, Lucky? Not much. BEV: Let me guess. Are you an artist of some sort? No. MEG: He just fucks up. Yeah, he's a scrote sucking, try-hard, up himself, ancient, nagging, full of himself, whinging, whining, rolled-gold bag of mistakes! - and digs that for you, dicks and mistakes! - Alright! [SUZIE LAUGHS DRUNKENLY] LUCKY< Oh, the Japanese tour. We'd lost so much money! And I had that rash on my face, cos I was allergic to the bath salts in the hotels, and someone kept leaving the K off my tags, so I was called Lucy wherever I went. [SUZIE LAUGHS] Maybe they don't have K in the Japanese language. Oh, except Karate. And Karaoke. - Did Toby never tell you? - What? - What? He called ahead to make sure they spelled your name "Lucy" [LAUGHS] Wow. I'm impressed! You're actually quite nice. It's not my natural state. No. Arrogant boy-man is your natural state. Only when I'm around you cos I hate you. Don't hate you... I mean, you ruin my life, but I don't hate you. Okay. Let's do this, Lucky. - Let's do this. - No., let's not do this. Let's talk about... Perth real estate. Wow, that bubble has to burst soon. It can't possibly... No no no! I want to, Lucky. I want to have it all out. Now. Okay. [SUZIE GIGGLES] Well, who starts? Well you're the one who introduced substance into the conversation. Okay. You think I was the reason Toby left the band. but you need to know that he'd made his decision way before I came along. It's an interesting angle. Well, you wanna blame me, I get it, but he was over it! I don't blame you- Oh, I see - you don't blame me, but you hate me? Don't hate you., I hate that you.... No... I was gonna say I hate that you came along, but but I like that you came along. Umm... I hate that I... I hate that I think.. I actually think... I'm never gonna be able to have a proper relationship, because I won't... I can't... imagine... meeting anyone that I love a half, a tenth as much as I love... you, and... I can't say anything about it, cos you're my brother's wife, obviously shouldn't be saying it now, I've successfully not said it for 5 years. Every fucking day for 5 years. but then you had to go and ask, with your perfect fucking face, you had to ask. Didn't ya? [SIGHS] You're so fucking beautiful. Shut ya face. BEV: Cocklebidy!

I've been lonely, and angry, - but I love him. - Yeah. We can just delete the whole night, can't we? Can't honestly believe that you'll never meet someone?

So this is how it's gonna be? MEG: Lucky? [SIGHS] [HORSE WHINNIES IN FLOAT] Was kind of hoping there wasn't a horse in the back. [MOCKING] Er, it's a horse float. What did you think would be in the back? [HIGH PITCH] There must be a reason that fate delivered us this horse float! [DEEP VOICE] Ah, there's no such thing as fate, child. Only nothingness. [HIGH] Really? [DEEP] Nothing means anything, It's all just random nothings just happening, like, randomly. [HIGH] But surely some things happen for a reason! [DEEP] Ah, when a hay  bale falls down a hill, and kills a guy from The Beatles or whatever? It's just like maths, dude. You delivered us a horse float, to be fair. Me, fate, same thing. Are you gonna say something? Lucky? Are you gonna tell him? It could ruin everything- I'm not gonna destroy my family for a stupid fuck, Suze. You make a big fucking drama out of it. Haven't you ever had a one-night stand? Tip for beginners: This is where you fuck off. [DOOR SHUTS] [CRIES] Norseman! Norseman with a horse, man! No? Nothing? Took me 3 hours to come up with that. Did I fall asleep? A bit, You were like, half-asleep, like your eyes were open. You snored and groaned. It was a bit gross, actually. [TYRES SCREECH] What are you- Why are we turning off? MEG: I just need to pick something up. LUCKY: You need to pick something... Yeah! You'll see. MEG: Marco! Can I help you? That's our Ute. - Is it? - What I just said. Yeah. Well, show us ya reg-o papers, then. - LUCKY: Hold on, is this even legal? Are you allowed to just take people's cars? Finders keepers, mate. Law of the jungle. - I don't think that's the law- - Lucky! Just... That's our piano, too. - 300 bucks. - Woah, hold on mate. This is my piano- MEG: Lucky! Can you just.. I... shut up? Okay. {sighs] What is you take the Ute and we'll take the piano? - Meg, no. - Or, we could call the cops and see- Yeah, alright, alright. Got yourself a deal. Yeah. MEG: But you'll need to load it for us as well. MARCO: I'm not loading it- MEG: Marco! Yeah, I'll load it then. It's alright. Gotta get the... forklift. - Meg, you don't need to do this. - No. It's fine. Seriously. I dunno, it's... it's just metal. Isn't it? Actually... [DRILL WHIRRS] MEG: Just think, Lucky. Tomorrow, you'll be rid of me. You'll be home, in Perth, with your mum, and your your arsehole brother, the love of your life, and I know what you're thinking. You're thinking "Oh Meg. You're so wonderful. What am I going to do without you? Uh." Actually, I was thinking "Oh Meg. What are we going to do about the horse?" Mate, is this safe? Yeah, he seems calm. He's just a horse. So, Marco, you go untie it. You hold that so he has... So he knows you're his friend. Stop! Stop him! MARCO: You idiot! LUCKY: Erm... [MEG LAUGHS] LUCKY: Just shut up!
