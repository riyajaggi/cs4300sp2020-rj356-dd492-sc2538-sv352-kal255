Err... she said that she was staying at some friends, but they haven't seen her in over a week. and the phone was under a pillow, but I had this number, right, in my phone, - from when she last rang. - Yeah, right and... when she... [BREAKS DOWN] When she rang... Sorry...  It's been an average couple of weeks. Umm... - Andy...  - See, I missed her calls, and... - It's okay. Meg told me about... your son. - You've seen her then? Oh God. Thank God! Yeah, she's not in any trouble, I got her there safely. Got her where?! Thanks. I was busting. FAKE MUM: No dramas, darl'!

[UNDER BREATH] Come on, come on, come on... Where are you, Meg? [SCREECHING TYRES] Meg! Ahh! Shit! No... you stupid idiot! [POLICE SIRENS] - Meg! - What the hell, Lucky? - Stay where you are, mate! - LUCKY: I spoke to your dad, and I told him I'd find you and I went back to the house. I couldn't just leave you wandering around the streets of Kalgoorlie. MEG: You idiot! You need to go to your mum! She's going to die, and you're not going to get to say goodbye, and it's all my fault! - No! I shouldn't have left you! - MEG: I told you to! I should've known! I'm the grown-up, Meg! - Ow! You're hurting my fingers! - Shut up, mate! - Just stay there, Meg! - Lucky! MEG: I did it! I stole the car! He didn't do anything, it was all me! I stole it! [PANTING] Can you just put out an alert or something? Her name's Meg, she's like 5', little... skinny kid with a furious look on her face. Officer? Can I have my phone at least? So I can ring her dad? - COP: [INTERVIEWING] - LUCKY: So he knows... She's all on her own. She's better off on her own than with a car thief! I'm not a fucking car thief! Not a very smart one anyway. I mean, who steals a car from Esme? He stole a car from Esme?? Who's Esme? [LAUGHS] He's got balls, I'll give him that much! - Why do I have balls? - COP: Right, listen! You have to just be quiet for the next 5... Esme! Er... you're here early! It's not really protocol for the victim to meet the... perp. Hello, sweetheart. H-hi. Where's Haymaker? - Who? - ESME: So, they tell me, there was a piano forte, of all things, in my float where there used to be a racehorse. Hmm? So where is he? Where's my racehorse? I don't know. We lost him. Let's get these off then, eh? - You don't wish to pursue the matter? - Err... no, no, I don't think so. I think it's all just pretty clear. It's all just been a little bit of a misunderstanding. - Thank you? - ESME: Yer. - And I am really sorry that we lost your... - No. No need. These things happen. I mean, who amongst us hasn't lost a large mammal once or twice, eh? - LUCKY: [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] - Thank you, Constable. Erm. MEG: [PANTING] - MEG: I stole it! - Huh? I stole the truck. And the horse float. - And the horse. - COP: Oh. You'd be Meg, then. Okay, listen, Mr Flynn was driving. He's the one that's culpable, so I'd just keep my mouth shut. Okay? - But where is he? - MAN: Esme's got him. OFFICER: Shut up! He's gone. MEG: Gone where? - MAN: You don't wanna know! - Shut! Up! MEG: Okay, please? He has to get to Perth. Where is he? Look, if you have nowhere to go, I'll get you the number for Family Services. They can come down, maybe find you some... [DOOR SHUTS] Oh, for... [SOUND OF PIANO PLAYING] Hey! Hey, that's my piano. Not anymore, it's not. It's evidence. Evidence of what? - Come on. Bugger off. - MEG: If you wreck that piano, I... Fuck! ESME: I got him at auction for $900. The others took the piss out of me for bidding, but I got there early, you understand? and I saw them trying to get that little bugger off that float, and I saw his eyes. He. Fucking. Hated 'em. He hated everything. He was just so fucking angry at the world. I reckon, he never forgave them for chopping his balls off. He has made me nearly 200 grand in the last 5 years. You just had to hit the shit out of him on that final bend. [SUCKS ON VAPE] [PHONE BUZZES] Oh, sorry. Sorry. I just have to get this. I'm sorry, I'll just be a minute. Yeah well, you can make that phone call later my darlin', if you're feeling up to it. - This is Lucky Flynn, leave a message. - [BEEP] Fuck! Lucky, I wish you'd pick up. I just, I really... I'm sorry that I lied about Mum. I just, I... I thought if you knew that I had nowhere to go, and then when you said you were going western Australia, it just felt like it was, it was far away enough. You know? And after a while, I started to believe it myself. and it's a bit messed up, isn't it? Anyway... [SNIFF] Okay, going now. Bye! I promise you, I am not a person who steals cars. Just, I'm trying to get to Perth, to see my mum. - ESME: Wow. - LUCKY: Because... Well... she's dying, actually. Right, well, everyone's mum is dying. The only people who don't have dying mums, are the ones whose mums are already dead. [HORSE RACE COMMENTARY ON TV] Draft, thanks. ALEX: Err, get us a jug you stingy prick! [LAUGHS] - MEG: Hey. - KANE: Jug... Is that your crane? I drive it. I need to borrow it. ALEX: Something you're not telling us, Kane? Sperm bank been giving out your details? Sure, no worries. [LAUGHS] Thanks. Woah woah woah woah woah. I was joking. You don't just borrow a 32 ton crane. - But I re... - KANE: Get outta here. Jeez. Go on, piss off! MEG: What if I beat you in a game of pool? ALEX: Woohoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! MEG: Come on! Scared I'll win? ALEX: Aw, bro! Your new daughter's awesome! [LAUGHS] ESME: Do you why the world is going to shit? It's because everyone has a reason for everything. Now, philosophically, I get it. It's not my fault I'm like me, it's not your fault you're like you. So, if you have some terrible tale that explains why you stole my vehicle, and my racehorse, then I am truly sorry for your troubles. I am not lacking in empathy. Irregardless, the reality is, there still has to be consequences. You need to take responsibility for your mistake. Fair's fair? - LUCKY: I do... - ESME: Fair's... fair... ? ... Start to get underway. The late scratching of Haymaker... No pressure, bro. We're not judging your manhood or anything. Yeah, yeah, shut up.

That's my pocket. What the fuck does that mean? West Aussie rules, sis. Yeah, you have to nominate a pocket and and it can't be his. Sucks ballsies. [CROWD "OOH" S] [CROWD GASPS] - [CROWD CHEERS] - ALEX: Oh, yeah! [LAUGHS] ALEX: Oh, here we go. [CROWD COMMISERATES] ALEX: Unlucky, sis. [CAR REVS ITS ENGINE] So this used to be a two-up shed, before online pokies killed everything. So I started this. I source the fighters. I run the books. I make a very nice margin on beer and saussie rolls, thank you very much. But every now and then, you do get a pretty good fight, but, if I'm gonna be honest with you, mostly they just wanna see blood. Sit. What the hell did you want to lift anyway? Piano. KANE: Piano? Yep. I used to play the piano. [CROWD CHEERS] Please... I will find your horse. I promise. - Or I-I-I can get you money... - ESME: Hey, sweetheart, listen, all I need from you, is to just stay on your feet for a couple of rounds, okay? - ESME: You give them something to bet on. - Jesus Christ this is a fucking joke, right? I can't fight! - I'm just... - ESME: You're not just anything, mate! You are the useless piece of shit. That stole my champion racehorse, aren't ya? Put this dickhead up against Bevan. 15 to 1. [SHOUTS] Beautiful! What's your name? Lucky. [LAUGHS] Fuck! Me! Mwah! Mwah! [SHOUTS] Beautiful! KANE: So? Where do you want it? - MEG: I dunno! - KANE: Right. - *** - It's Lucky's, but he was in the lock-ups. Someone took him. Someone called Esme? I think? What? ESME: Oh, one more little thing. I put $300 on you. What? 'Cos I saw you in Cocklebiddy, before you stole my vehicle, Right, and I saw your anger, and I can see it now, just here, just behind the fear. Now, if you win, Huh? What? Win?! I... ESME: If you win, I'll split it with ya. See? Fair's fair. - But I... - You go get 'em, tiger! - LUCKY: Please... - CROWD: Fight! Fight! Fight!
