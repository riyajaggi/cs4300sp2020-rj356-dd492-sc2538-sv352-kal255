 [Hiccup] This changes everything. [panting] [Tuffnut] My back. Okay, you dragged us all the way up here. What is it you have to show us? It better involve food or destruction. Or a combination of the two. I bet you're wondering why I brought you here. The answer is, to show you my latest invention. Presenting the Dragonfly One. Huh? Huh? [clucking softly]

 The chicken is not amused. [clucks] What is it? It's a flight suit. Don't all applaud at once. I don't need to remind you that we already have flying dragons. Why would we ever need a flight suit? What if we were to get separated from our dragons mid-flight? We might need to solo fly until we catch up with them. When this doesn't work, and it clearly won't, can I have Toothless? -Oh, for Thor's sake. -[growls] What are you planning on doing? Jumping. Unless someone has a better idea.

 [sighs] Boys! [Hiccup] Guys, relax! Feel that updraft? That's why I chose this place. It'll pick up my wings and I'll float on air. [grunting] [chuckles awkwardly] Or crashing on a bed of rock. [growls] Okay, everyone. Dragonfly One, maiden flight. [screams] Hiccup! I don't know about you but I was under the impression that a flight suit was supposed to fly. Yeah, that looks more like a plummet suit. [Ruffnut chuckles] Do it again. Okay, so I made a few tweaks. Now behold some serious flying. Yeah, baby! [laughs] [screaming] [thudding] [splash] This time, I absolutely know where I went wrong. It's all in the timing. I judged the updrafts wrong. I assure you, I definitely have it now. Don't worry, bud. I've got this under control. See? There it is. Okay, now! Come on! [screams] Whoa! Wait! I'm flying? I'm flying! Woo-hoo! [laughing] Excellent! I cannot believe that hunk of junk actually worked. Okay, right turn. [gasps] Might have to work on the steering a bit. Toothless! -[gasping] -Oh, Thor! Oh, Thor! [screams] What the-- Aaah! [coughs] Thanks for the save, bud. Whoa! Again. Well, it looks like our flight tests are probably over for the day. Okay, that's it. You're done with this. Right. For now. [screeching] What was that? Sounded like a dragon in distress. Something about that call seems strangely familiar. Not good familiar. Bad familiar. [flapping] Huh? -Guys? -[Hiccup] Snotlout, come on. [Snotlout] You've got to be kidding me. The calls are coming from up ahead. [screeches] A Speed Stinger. Why did it have to be a Speed Stinger? Looks like a young one. Why would it be out during day? They're nocturnal. Poor little guy. Let's head home! It's getting dark, and where there's one, there's usually a whole pack! Hiccup, its leg is badly injured and Speed Stingers can't fly. That's why we can't leave it to predators. Come on, Toothless. Is he seriously going back? Snotlout, meet Hiccup. Of course he's going back! [Snotlout] Oh, come on! -[screeching] -Hey, whoa, no, no. Easy there. Easy, little fella. It looks like it can defend itself just fine. Let's get out of here. -Ssh! Quiet down, Snotlout. -You quiet down. This little guy won't be a match for wild boars or dragons. A Stinger without its pack is extremely vulnerable. Must've gotten separated from the others, they had to go before the sun came out. Sounds right. Let's go. We can't leave him like this. We'll bring it to Dragon's Edge, nurse it to health, then bring it back. [groans] [Hiccup] Ruff? Tuff? You understand the plan? -Yeah. Of course. -Definitely. -No. -Nope. All right. Secure the Stinger so I can set the splint with the broken pieces of Dragonfly One. And be careful! We all remember what these guys' stings can do. You don't have to remind me. I know what they can do. -[snarls] -[groans] This plan is insane. You know that, right? If I'm saying it's insane, it's actually insane. Actually, it is insane. And for once, it wasn't our plan. I'm seeing a pattern here! First that lunatic flight suit, now this. -Could it be? -Is Hiccup coming over to our side? Oh, Loki, please let it be so! We will welcome him with open arms. [ominously] Teach him the ways of the truly disturbed! Guys, please. Let's just do this. [both laugh] Whoa! Come and get me. Fresh meat on the grill, right over here. No! Over here! I'm all yours. Turn me into a pin cushion. I'll give you a target. It's my butt! That's it? That's all you've got? Guys, what are you doing? I meant secure the tail! We know what we're doing. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, what's happening to me? I can't... Talk? She can't talk! I think that's what she's saying. Hm. Interesting. Only part of her is paralyzed. Since it's an adolescent, its sting potency must not be at full effect. How do we get it to sting her lower half? Here, Speedy. Come on. [whistles] It's the whole lower half of Ruffnut. Don't you want it? Ha-ha! Yeah! Uh. Someone help Tuff! -I got the stinger. -I got the head. There! Hey, okay. We're here to help. He's gonna do the hand thing. Please tell me he's gonna do the hand! [sniffs] Okay, I think we're good. Let's load him up and get him back. [Astrid] You know the pack is going to do everything in its power to find it? [Hiccup] Yep. That's why we have to get him back to this island as quickly as we can. [screeches] [roars] [Fishlegs] Have a look at this. Wow. Nice work. Uh-huh. All thanks to the carefully designed rehab program based on trust and understanding. Fishlegs, what's with your arm? Let's just say that the Stinger and I may or may not have had a few differences of opinion these last few days. Look at that! It's like a dead old fish. [chuckles ] Okay, Meatlug, back to work. And we'll bring this, just in case. [sighs in exasperation] Come on, little fella, you can do it! There we go, little guy. Huh! Ornery and stubborn, but it seems like it's accepting Fishlegs and Meatlug. Makes sense, they are pack dragons. They function as a group. But if they accept you then you have their allegiance. You're not actually thinking of trying to train it? What? No! No. I could never. Well, well, well, lookie here. Our little friend can stand on his own again. Only a matter of time before it's trying to sting us into oblivion. [shrieks] My vote is take it to where we found it. I'll get the cage. Snotlout! [screams, then hisses] He's staying here. At least for the time being. Having a Speed Stinger around is too dangerous, especially for me. Not even on your best day, pal. Good news! The stinger venom wore... off. Okay, everyone. No sudden moves. Who's got jokes? Frozen from the waist down. Come on. Hey, settle down, big fella. I'm your friend, remember? [grunting] Ruffnut, one. Dead leg, zero. -Not so dead after all. -What'd you do that for? Like I have any control-- Guys? Quiet down. I think he's agitated. Makes two of us. You better control that butt before it gets kicked. I was afraid of this. Everyone take cover! [both gasp] [grunting] [sighs] Phew! Please, remain calm. Everything is going to be okay. Remain calm! Barf! Stormfly, spine shot! [screeches] -Guys, a little help here? -[Tuffnut] Uh, no. That is really unsettling. Exactly as I thought would end up. That thing is going to paralyze everyone on the island. There's going to be no one to take that stupid dragon back to where we found it. I'm too tired to argue with you. We'll talk about this in the morning. Hey, if you want to get rid of that Stinger, I'm in. [grunts] I don't know how much more of this I can take. I figure it's him or me. Good news, little guy. Your splint comes off today! Nurse Meatlug, if you would do the honors, please? Yeah, you see? No more pain. Whoa! Wow! You sure had a lot of energy stored up. Oh, dear. Meatlug, stop him! Speed Stingers can't swim! Whoa! How did you do that? Webbing. Of course. You can't fly, so you needed a way to island hop. You adapted, evolved. That's incredible! I have to tell Hiccup about this! [Hiccup] This is enormous, Fishlegs. Finally, actual proof of dragon evolution. -It's historic. -I know, right! The webbing actually inspired me to make a few changes on something. If you say Dragonfly Two, I'm locking you up. Oh, no. He's gone. How could he have gotten out? He couldn't. At least not on his own. And I have a pretty good idea who helped. Oh, how cute! He's dreaming. [imitating a girl] No, he's not. He's waking up. It's almost sunset! Great. Ruffnut gets paralyzed. Again. [Snotlout] Come on, Hookfang, fly faster! -Oh, no. -The ropes should hold. I tied them really... tight. Whoops. "Whoops"? That's all you got? There's other things I'd say, but none are very ladylike. Ah! Uh-oh. Snotlout, Viking going overboard. [grunting] [Snotlout] Uh-oh. Hookfang! [grunts] Huh? Ew! Hey, watch the tongue! [slurring] Hey, Hiccup. I got stung again. Just the right side this time. I tried to walk it off but I keep going around in a circle. Dragon-napping, Snotlout? This is a new low, even for you. I was trying to save us! [screeching in distance] You guys heard that, right? Please tell me that was an echo. [screeching] Oh, no. The pack's come looking for it. How is that possible? Speed Stingers can't fly! We did just discover that these particular Speed Stingers can travel across water. What? How? If we keep quiet, we might not give away our location. [screeching] [screeching] I'm guessing that very soon I'm gonna wish I could run in a straight line. You! I knew you'd rat us out. [loud screeching] Guys! Stand your ground! [whimpering] Hey, girl, thanks. There's too many of them. Our only hope is to draw them away. I'm not leaving anyone behind! -Since when? -Since right now. Don't ask why, but I'm suddenly feeling selfless and heroic. Back! Get away! Uh-oh. Gotta get away. Come on, leg! Don't worry. I'll be back. Come and get me, Needle Butts! Go get them, Snotlout! Snotlout, Snotlout. Oi! Oi! Oi! Keep chasing. [panting] Gone? [rustling] And that's because they're here for the ambush. This was a bad idea. What the... Wait. I'm never going to get you. [screeches angrily] What? He's torn between his pack and the one that saved his life. -Ours. -But he hates me! But you're one of us. It's his instinct to protect you. [growls] Get out of here before he realizes he has to choose a side. Okay, bud. Let's get them back in the water. I brought backup. Woo-hoo! [laughs] Yeah! Nice, Barf. I mean, freaky, but nice just the same. Oh, no. Barf and Belch are down. We need to get rid of that chief. [screeches] Toothless, separate! Dragonfly Two, go! [laughs] Excellent! [screeching] Yeah! Swim away, Stingers! [growls sadly] No. I'm sorry, but, little guy, you need to go back with your own. What are you doing? We can't let him go back! Snotlout, it's where he belongs. That's his real pack. Just when we were starting to get along. Why does this always happen? Can you believe what that dragon did? He helped us, over his own Alpha. For that time, he was part of our pack. And we were part of his. -Even Snotlout, somehow. -Scared? Ha! That Stinger was more scared of me than I was of him. Isn't that them swimming towards us? Maybe they're coming back for you, Snotlout. What? No! -They weren't swimming this way. -Look at him run. Stupid. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
