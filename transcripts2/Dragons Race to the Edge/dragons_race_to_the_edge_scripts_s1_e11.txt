 [Hiccup] This changes everything. [cackling] [evil laughter] Come on, Windshear, get us out of here! Oh, Heather, don't fight it. [screeching] Toothless, we have to save her. Well, look who the dragon flew in! Glad you could join us, brother. It wouldn't feel like a family reunion without you. Now, take out that Night Fury!

 [man] Don't let him get away! Blast the chains, Toothless, now! Dragon-proof chains? Ha-ha. Nice try, Hiccup. You didn't think I'd make it that easy for you, did you? [man] Come on, lads, get him. [grunting] Whoa! Okay, that was too close. Come on, bud. If we can't blast the chains... blast the winches. -Come to Dagur. -[Hiccup] Fire! Nice shooting, bud. Ahem. Excuse me, what good are dragon-proof chains without dragon-proof winches? -[thud] -Ow.

 You can't take on Dagur and his fleet all by yourself. I'm not by myself. I have Windshear. I'm too close. I might not get this shot again. But this is suicide! I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Are you willing to sacrifice Windshear, too? [sighs] Heather, there will be another time. I promise you. [groans] Blasting the winches, pretty smart. Yeah, and a little luck never hurts, either. I talked to Johann. He told me Dagur wiped out your village... and your family. I'm sorry. Then you know why he has to pay. I do. But you don't have to do this alone. I don't know. It seems like I'm destined to be alone. First, when I was a little girl, I get separated from my birth family. Your birth family? Yes, but I don't remember much. It was so long ago. Just a few pictures in my mind. I remember my father's hands. They were rough, like sandstone,  but so gentle. And I remember the smell of his wooden shield.  I don't think I was supposed to play  with it, but he let me anyway. And this. He gave me this horn. I don't know if it means something, but whenever I look at it, I think of him. I just wish I knew who he was. [growling] [snarling] [loud growl] Look, I'm sorry I locked up your dragons. I just didn't trust that you guys would let me go after Dagur. Trust does need to be earned with people and dragons. -Thanks for understanding, Fishlegs. -[giggles] I don't really trust these guys either. We can hear you. Jealousy is an ugly quality, Astrid. But clearly, I understand where it comes from. Ugh. The point is, we have your back, Heather. You're one of us. Yeah, I stocked Windshear's stable with buckets of sea slugs. [groans] And I made room for you in my hut. And I've made it clear to Snotlout that you're not staying in his hut. Even though you were the rogue dragon rider and you sabotaged our dragons and you snuck away in the night. Wait, why do we like you again? I'm truly sorry, Tuffnut. Whoa! That was... sincere. What am I supposed to do with that? [breathing heavily] I'm feeling a little bit flushed and overwhelmed. Little help here? People! Ugh! Help yourself! And if you need any help with Windshear-- Why don't I show you around the Edge? I'm basically chief. Thanks, guys, really. I-- Hey, glad you're back. Your dragon rocks. -Let's go have some girl time. -Good idea. [Astrid grunts] Two axes are better than one. True. Unless you have one of these. You really have to show me how you made that. Sure, but I prefer close combat to throwing... [grunts] so I can stare my enemy in the eye. Not a bad tactic. But don't discount... Hyah! Hmm... The element of surprise. I like that. It's one of Hiccup's favorite tactics. So, you two are a thing, right? What? No, just friends. Come on. I've seen the way you two are together. No. Seriously. Friends. Hmm. He's kind of cute. I guess. If you like that unassuming, heroic, dragon rider type. Bull's-eye. Now, you and Snotlout, that's a match made in Valhalla. [both laugh] I don't know whether to thank you or feel sorry for you. I can handle Snotlout. And besides, I'm not into the macho Viking type. I like a little smarts. Like Fishlegs. Fishlegs? Seriously? What? I think he's funny and cute. We're talking about Fishlegs, right? The guy with the Gronckle? Okay, all right. Enough boy talk. What else do you do for fun around here? [laughing] Keep up! [screaming] [whooping] [screaming] [sighs] Thanks, Windshear. Want to go two out of three? No. I want to show you something. If you can keep up. Get 'em, Stormfly! [sniffing] Hey, would you knock it off, bud? Okay? Snooping will not gain her trust. Huh. Wait a minute. That's my dad's Chief Seal! What are we doing back at your campsite? -You forget something? -Nope. Stay put, Stormfly. Keep your ears up. [suspenseful music playing] Oh... It must be here. Are you gonna clue me in on what we're doing here? [huffing] -Hello? -I'm looking for something. -[leaves rustling] -Looking for something like... Trader Johann? Miss Astrid, so nice to see you again! Would you mind, please, lowering your axe so my frightened soul might be granted safe passage back to my body? -Ugh... -[chuckles] Johann! Thank Thor. Ooh. Miss Heather! I'm overjoyed you're not dead. When the Terrible Terror returned with the message I sent, I was worried. Then, when I arrived here and saw your campsite abandoned, I feared the worst. Someone needs to tell me what's going on. You see, Miss Astrid, if you need exotic spices from a foreign land, or one-of-a-kind cured leathers or incredibly-difficult-to-obtain information detailing the exact whereabouts of a certain dastardly Berserker, Trader Johann is your man. Dagur. And if you need a warrior to take care of that dastardly Berserker... I'm your girl. So he's got the info and you've got the axe. Now what? Dagur is set to purchase a fleet of new ships from a group of salty undesirables in the Sea of Despair. But be wary. These new ships for his armada are outfitted with powerful anti-dragon winches and catapults! After the deal is done, I won't be able to find him again. Dagur will be back in the wind. Adrift, like a leaf in a stream. [blows] Ugh. And I've used my last grapevine, so I can't offer my invaluable, yet expensive information. Got it. Thanks, Johann. Come on, Astrid. You're not coming? What part of this implies "rushing into battle on a flying lizard"? Hiccup! From my lips to Odin's ears. I was just saying I could use you and Toothless's help with a pesky flock of wild Nadders that have been driving me batty! -[screeching] -Yeah, you heard me, you lousy... No time, Gobber. I need to see my dad. It's urgent. In that case, he's in the Great Hall. But it's Berk's Gripe Day, so there might be a bit of a wait. -[snarling] -Uh-huh. Stinky little buggers. [sighs wearily] Stoick, them wee ones of mine are making me crazy! They run all over the house, breaking and wrecking everything. They won't sit still for a minute. I'm exhausted. Ugh. That's because they're sheep, Sven. And they should be kept outside! Aw, but they do get so lonely. [bleating] Dad! Hiccup! We really need to talk. Hmm. We gotta go now. Dagur won't be out in the open for long. You want us to battle with Dagur and the Berserkers without Hiccup and Toothless? Guys, I wish Hiccup and Toothless were here, trust me. But they're not. And we can't wait. Dagur's ships have dragon-proof chains and grappling hooks. And the ships he's buying are more powerful. But with all of us attacking at once, he won't know what hit him. Any aerial assault of this magnitude would be foolish without Toothless. He's the most powerful dragon in our arsenal. [groans] But you're still my favorite, girl. Well, it's not like we need Hiccup and Toothless. But it's nice to know that we have a Night Fury when things get hairy. You heard Johann, Astrid. This is our last chance. Tell them. Well... Look, Heather-- You, too? Just forget it. All that stuff about trust and having my back, I guess that was just talk. -[whistling] -Oh, man! Awkward. -Where did you get this? -It's Heather's. Hmm. She's the girl that stole Stormfly a few years back. Yes. Heather. Dad, that horn has your Chief Seal carved into it. It does. Is there something you need to tell me? [sighs] When a Chief has a child, that child receives many gifts from all over. When you were born, I asked Gobber to make the smallest axe he'd imagined. With a handle tiny enough for a baby to grasp. I wanted you to start training the moment you opened your eyes. I thought your mother was going to feed me to the boars. I remember that axe. Yeah, you used it as a paperweight. [stammers] About the horn, Dad, Heather told me her father gave it to her. But it has your seal on it. Hmm. Dad, is Heather my sister? [sighs] Looks like it's just you and me, Windshear... as usual. [Astrid] Hey! If we're gonna do this, it has to be a capture mission, not a kill mission. -Agreed? -Agreed. We'll sink Dagur's armada, drag him back to Outcast Island. Let him rot there. Okay. Then we're with you. You can thank me! I was the one who rallied these guys. That's not really my recollection. Quiet, Fishlegs! As soon as she left, your lips started to do that cute little quiver thing. [mocking] Quiet! That's a tic! It's a tic when I'm about to fight. -So, what changed your mind? -Hiccup. He would never want you to face Dagur alone again. And neither do I. -Well, I know right where Dagur is. -Good. Then you won't need this. Now, Hiccup will be able to find us. So, what's your plan? Hit him when he least expects it. [men shouting] [sighs] It's a good day to strengthen my armada. Then again, it's always a good day to strengthen my armada. [laughs evilly] [joins in laughter] What are you laughing at? The gold is ready for the exchange, sir. -Should we move it to the deck? -Leave it down below. But when they arrive with the ships, they'll be expecting our gold. Yes! And instead of our gold, we'll give them our steel. Heather? Guys? Where did everyone go? [sniffing] Huh? Oh, no. -There he is. -Let me guess. You want to attack like the rogue dragon rider that you are. A full frontal assault! No. Element of surprise? Dragons! Incoming! Prepare the grappling hooks! Ready the chains! It's hunting season. [shouting] [grunting] Ah. Too high to hit anything! Divert Dagur's attention and stay high enough to avoid his weaponry. We got to get lower! I can't-- I said higher! Hookfang, higher! [all clamoring] [man humming] [sighs] [whistling] What are they doing up there? Ah! Nice surprise face. Ooh! Yes! [groaning] [shushing] What the... Huh? What is going on? Come on, already! Oh, no! What are you doing? You two? Surprise, Dagur. Two axes are better than one. And twelve ships trumps two axes. [snarling] I should've seen that coming. Windshear, finish it! No, Heather, don't! You promised us a capture mission. Sorry, Astrid. I changed my mind. Dagur didn't "capture" my village. So this ends here. [laughs evilly] If you kill me, Heather, you'll never know-- Save it for the gods. Windshear! [screams] [Hiccup] Stop! Heather, stop. -Move, Hiccup! -You don't understand. You promised me there would be another time, and this is it! Look. You told me your father gave you this. He did, but what are you doing? This is my father's Chief Seal. Stoick's seal is carved in my horn? What are you saying? Years ago, Stoick gave this horn to the Chief of the Berserker tribe, Oswald the Agreeable, as a gift for his newborn daughter. You were that newborn, Heather. Oswald the Agreeable is your father. And he is also Dagur's father. No. [muffled] Mm? Heather, Dagur is your brother. You can't kill him. -Astrid. -I-- Fire! Incoming! Raise the catapults! It's the rest of Dagur's ships! Look out! [groaning] Heather, we have to go. I have to admit, you never disappoint, brother. Or maybe you're actually my uncle. Who knows in this crazy world? [laughs madly] Heather, come on! Heather, I'm the only family you've got left. Join me, sister! Don't fight destiny. I know you feel the Berserker blood flowing through your veins. No! [chuckling] [screaming angrily] What are you doing? Come back, sis! "Heather the Unhinged" has a nice ring to it, no? You'll be back, and I will welcome you with open arms! We'll have to wait on that reunion. Pity. Huh? What? I should've seen that one coming, too. All right, gang, back to the Edge! Under the circumstances, I wholeheartedly agree with that plan. Guess you're leaving. Again. I thought you were tired of being alone. I am. Then don't be. It's safer here. You have support. And I'm here. [sighs] I know. I just have a lot I need to figure out. Thanks, Astrid. It was nice having a friend again. Let's go, girl. Hey, I know you guys got pretty close. I'm sorry you're losing a friend. But I still have you. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
