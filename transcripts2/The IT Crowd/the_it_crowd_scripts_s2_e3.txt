 The IT Crowd (2006â€“2013): Season 2, Episode 3 - Moss and the German - full transcript 
 Whilst Jen flees Doug's advances and looks for a place where she is allowed to smoke Moss, feeling that he spends too much time with Roy, answers an advert for what he thinks is a German cookery course though in fact Johann, the German who placed the ad, is a cannibal who wants somebody to eat. Hearing that Johann has a state of the art television Roy pretends to offer himself as a victim, solely so that he can watch his new pirate DVD. Before anybody is eaten though there is a police raid but they are more concerned with the pirate DVD than cannibalism.

  You wouldn't steal a handbag, you wouldn't steal a car, you wouldn't steal a baby... ...you wouldn't shoot a policeman... and then steal his helmet. You wouldn't  go to the toilet in his helmet... ...and then send it to the  policeman's grieving widow and then steal it again! Downloading films is stealing. If you do it you WILL  face the consequences. Man, these anti-piracy ads  are getting really mean.

 I'll hold it in. PHONE RINGS Hello? Hello, Roy. Hello, Roy.  Hello Jeff Now, you know I  changed my name by deed poll... I'm not calling you Dominator, Jeff. I'm not calling you Dominator,Jeff.  But I am Dominator Whatever. I won't call you it. Forget it. Um now... listen, I was just wondering, have  you seen the new Tarantino film? I'm just about to watch it now, Jeff. I have already seen it. At the end there's  a very unusual twist. Aw! Ah no.  Oh, now I know there's a twist. I'm gonna spend the whole  film guessing what it is. Damn you, Dominator. Try and forget there's a twist. Oh, how can you  forget there's a twist? Oh, what's wrong with it now? Oh, come on.  If I don't see this film today then Jeff'll find out some way of telling  me what the twist is, I know he will. Come on! Work! Oh, look, I have to go. Moss. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  What's up with you? I can't do this any more. Do what? Moss, what are you  talking about? Here, let me help... We're just watching the film, Moss. Come on Roy, can't you see it? See what, Moss? See what, Moss?  We go to a film, sometimes the pub,  maybe get some dinner but it just goes on and on,  year in, year out. We're stagnating. You make it sound like we're  an old married couple. You make it sound like we're  an old married couple.  But we are. Can't you see? You're my wife, Roy,  you're my wife. You're my wife. We should be married to ladies  but we're married to each other.  You're my wife. Could you stop calling me your wife? Could you stop calling me your wife?  You're my wife Roy,  and I can't take it anymore If anything, I'm the husband Whoa, whoa, whoa,  what's this? What's this? Oh, come on. We don't even have ventilation here. We don't even have ventilation here.  I'll stand over here We don't even have ventilation here.  I'll stand over here  I don't care. No. I don't wanna go out on the street.  It's too... Soviet out there. Soviet? Yes.  It's cold, everyone looks oppressed. You know,  I remember when smoking was fun. All the cool kids were doing it. Every time I want a cigarette  now I have to go to Gorky Park. PHONE RINGS Don't answer that. Don't answer that.  Why not? That's a man called Dominator who  wants to tell me the twist in a film that I've been waiting to see  for ages. Don't answer it. Dominator? His real name is Jeff Hawthorne. His real name is Jeff Hawthorne.  We have to answer the phone No, we don't. No, look...  he'll give up in a second. I know Jeff. He'll need to go to the  toilet in about another two rings. PHONE RINGS PHONE RINGS AGAIN PHONE STOPS RINGING We're answering the phones. We are not answering the phones. You all right, Moss? I've got the blues, Jen. Why? Well, Roy and I are becoming  like an old married couple. Oh, will you please stop saying that? And I'm the husband! We just seem to do the  same thing day in, day out. I'm stagnating, Jen,  like a packet of crisps on the roof. It seems to me the problem is that  you spend too much time together. You should get out there  and meet other people. Other people? Yes. You mean people other than Roy? Well, yes. And these "other people",  where do they congregate? You could do an evening class  or something. Hold on a second.  What exactly am I supposed to do while she's out gallivanting  at her night classes and what not? You could meet other people as well. Yeah.  I don't like people. Ah, well, now that's not fair, Roy.  Have you met all of them? I've met enough of them. People!  What a bunch of bastards. PHONE RINGS Stephanie. ...Yes, hello. Oh, of course. ..OK. Bye.  Ohh...! I'm off.  Douglas is coming down. Douglas, why? Well, to be honest with you,  he's been making advances. You know, little things like asking me if I wanna go  for a ride in his helicopter. I'd like to go for a ride  in a helicopter. Well, grow a pair of tits. Tell you what, if I did  have tits, I wouldn't mind letting someone have a go on them  for a ride in a helicopter. Look who it is, everyone. It's only me. Jen, do you have a moment? No, I don't I'm very busy. I don't  wanna go for a ride in a helicopter. That wasn't what I  was gonna ask. What d'you want, then? Um... something work-related? What department is this? Sorry? If it's work-related, obviously  you'll know what department this is. What department is this? Some sort of, er  homosexual department? IT, it's IT. IT. I knew that, yes. That's what I wanted, actually. You see, my computer's broken  and I need someone to fix it. Roy's your man. Ergh. How do you fellas get any  work done with a hot piece of finger licking chicken like that? Me... I'd be a 24-hour tripod. Watch this, it looks good. Um, yeah, I've actually been really  looking forward to seeing this. You wanna come round to mine?  We can watch it there. I gotta pretty nifty  home cinema system. Um, well, mine is broken but I think  that maybe I'll just watch it... Excellent, that's settled!  Seven o'clock tonight. I'll get my PA to phone you  with my name and address. Ciao. Whoa, there. That's not my office. Ciao. Well, what's good for the goose  is good for the gander. And I'm the gander! I hear the ballet in Prague  is excellent this season. Hello, Yorg. Hello, Jen. Terrible isn't it?  Every year it gets worse. First they take away our smoking  room, then they push us outside. I wonder when they will decide just  to get it over with and kill us. Oh,Yorg... such a pessimist! Has he gone? Has who gone? Has who gone?  Bruce Wayne Oh, he's long gone, although  Roy's got a man date with him. It is not a man date. I am not a man-woman, we are  not married, I am not your wife! You'd willingly spend  time with Douglas? I really have to see this film soon. PHONE RINGS Oh, by the way I took your advice  about those evening classes. I'm going to learn how to cook. Oh, I'm so pleased, Moss! And I  have to say women do love a cook. Well, I answered an ad online. This time next month, when you  want German cuisine, I'm your man. German cuisine? Is German cuisine not good? No. Sounds fine. There's nothing more romantic  than a glass of wine and some Schweinefleicsh. Good, because usually when I try  something new it ends up a disaster. (GERMAN ACCENT) Oh...! I got  a reply to my advertisement. Maurice Moss. Mmm, he sounds delicious! (CACKLES) Oh! Ahh! Guten Abend. I mean hello. Hello. I'm Moss. Hello. I'm Moss.  Yes, yes, yes. I'm Johan  Come in, come in. Oh. Nice TV. Ah. Ah.  Good distance from the sofa Would you...  Would you like a drink? Ah yeah, white Russian, please. I don't know that.  How d'you make that? I don't know that.  How d'you make that?  I don't know.  We might as well get to it. Really? Gosh. So eager, so brave. Well, you know, once I've made up  my mind to do something, that's it. Oh, that's very admirable. So just do whatever you want with me.  I'm ready for anything. Ah! Well, right,  I will I suppose, um... take your clothes off  and we'll get started. Right. So how long does this course last? So how long does this course last?  Er, sorry? How long does this course last? How long does this course last?  Course, what course? Hang on, take my clothes off? Yes. Sorry I'm confused Well, so am I. What did you think this was? Well, I was going to eat you. I may have misheard you there. Did you just say that  you were going to eat me? Yes. Right, you did say that. Yes. Yeah, no, I'm here for the cookery. Yeah, no, I'm here for the cookery.  No, no, no, this is the cookery. Look, I've got your advert here... Yes. Yes.  I printed it out. Yes. I want to cook with you. Ah no, no, my English  is not so good, um... Ohhhh! You want to cook with me,  using me, you mean. Ah yes! Yes. You see. Oh, yes, yes. I see where the confusion was.  I thought this was a cookery course. I see where the confusion was.  I thought this was a cookery course.  Hahaha. No, no. But you wanted someone who would  agree to let you kill and eat them. Ja,ja. You see? Ja,ja. You see?  That is funny Ehh. So you're not interested? Oh, no, thanks, it's not for me. How disappointing. I'm sorry, Johan,  this must be such a let down. Had my tonsils out last month,  I could have kept them. Ahh. I feel like such a turnip. Do you want to watch a film? OK. I have Oceans Eleven. Original or remake? Well, yeah, you could come over here,  we could put on some music, I could give you a back rub,  see what happens. Oh, no, wait, I've got this guy  coming over to watch a DVD. Another time, maybe. OK. Oh, and some chicken wings, please.  Thank you. DOORBELL Ah! # There's somebody at the door,  there's somebody at the door # There's somebody at the door. # Hey, it's my G. Um, I'm really sorry I was late.  It was... It's cool. Hey, you know, we should  do this sort of thing more often. I hate the whole boss/employee  thing, don't you? Yeah. You wanna seal the deal  with a high five? You wanna seal the deal  with a high five?  Yes. (LAUGHS) So, what are we watching? So, what are we watching?  It's a Tarantino production  south Korea zombie movie Wow! I didn't know there was  a south Korea. OK, put it on. I've ordered pizza and chicken wings and there's a cooler beside you,  so help yourself to beer. and there's a cooler beside you,  so help yourself to beer.  Don't mind if I do. FILM STARTS Oh, I've heard of this flick.  There's a twist in it, isn't there? Yeah. Just... just try and Forget that and hopefully  we'll still be able to enjoy it. I bet he's a woman, that bloke.  No, you think it's the future, but it's actually set in the past. It's not Earth. It's all a dream. Oh, could you not...  could you... could you not try and guess what the twist is? It's just  that might get a little annoying. But isn't that half the fun,  trying to guess the twist? Er, personally, I think it... it kind of, it ruins the fun. Well, I think it makes it more fun. It's just I don't. Well, I do and I'm the boss. I'm your boss. (IMITATES GUNSHOT) They're all clones.  He's his own brother. Everyone's a ghost. Have you still not  seen the film yet? Have you still not  seen the film yet?  No. What's that? What? It's cold and I'm going out  for a cigarette. Morning.  Oh, you must be Jen's mother. What a night I had last night. Oh, yes, the cookery, how was it? I am so embarrassed,  I cannot tell you. What happened? It wasn't a cookery class at all. What was it? He wrote it down wrong,  cos his English isn't very good. He wrote it down wrong,  cos his English isn't very good.  Always the way. And it turns out he didn't  want to teach me how to cook... And it turns out he didn't  want to teach me how to cook... (THEY GIGGLE) He wanted to cook me. THEY LAUGH THEY STOP LAUGHING What? He wanted to eat me. I know - egg and my face  were in alignment. He wanted to eat you? Yes. Oh! He's one of those German cannibals He is and he was such a nice man. Oh, was he? Yeah. He was a fine young cannibal. Hang on, hang on, he...  he... he wanted to eat you. Yeah, keep up Jen. So we had a laugh about it  and in the end I didn't really feel like being eaten,  so we just watched Ocean's Eleven. Ah. Original or remake? Ah. Original or remake?  Is that really the  most important question? I... I...hang on, you watched a...  you watched a film with him? Yes. With the man that wanted to eat you? With the man that wanted to eat you?  Who else? Why didn't you call the police? Why didn't you call the police?  Why would I call the police? He wanted to eat you! Only with my consent and, believe me,  my consent was not forthcoming. Good for you, Moss. But, eh...  eating people is illegal. Only without their consent. No, Moss, no, no, no. It's a grey area, give me that. I knew something was askew. Whoever heard of German food?! But you should see his place,  it's incredible. He's got a great system, 50 inch TV. Really? Maybe we could watch  the film at his place! Maybe we could watch  the film at his place!  Oh, I don't know Roy, he's only really interested  in people he can eventually eat. he's only really interested  in people he can eventually eat.  Ahh. Tell him he can eat me! Are... are you insane?  You've got to call the police. Oh, Jen,  don't be such an old fuddy-duddy. The world has changed. If two grown men can't make  a pervert happy for a few minutes in order to watch a film  about zombies then maybe we should all just move to Iran. I don't know, Roy, it does seem  a little immoral to mislead him. But then, as Jen pointed out earlier, being a cannibal's  a little immoral too. I'm in an ethical pickle. Turns out meeting new people  is a lot more complicated than I'd originally thought. Psst, Jen. Yorg. You cannot smoke here. They are  moving us to a new smoking area. Oh, so the rumours were true. Quickly, before they see you. Jen, what are you doing? It's over, Yorg. We must fight them Jen We must all fight them. We must  keep smoking until the bitter end. Yorg. Yorg, such fire. I am too tired for revolution. And we've walked (BLEEP) miles. Goodbye, Yorg. Taxi! Let's not fight again. No. And look, we're out,  we're meeting people. Yes. Ah? You were a bit wonky. Thanks, dear. Hello! Hello! Hello! How wonderful! Johan, this is Roy.  Roy, this is Johan. Hello Johan. I... I brought dessert. Ahh! Come in. Come in. Ja. Oh, this is lovely... Yes. Yes. Lovely. Oh, isn't this nice. OK, so we'll watch the film, then  I'll tell him I changed my mind. Ahh! Lovely and...  Oh, wow, now that's a guitar. So, Roy, ha... has Moss explained to you my,  um... desires. He has indeed. And are you interested? I'm very interested. Ah, splendid! Yes. Moss, if you will excuse us.  Do you eat in here? Yes, this way please. Yes, this way please.  Ahh But, Roy, didn't you want to  watch this film that I have here? Ooh, I'd completely forgotten. There was that film that I wanted  to watch before Johan ate me. That's right. There it is there now. Yes. Yes.  So you want to watch a film? Yes, thanks. Is that OK? Er... Yes, yes, of course. I'll put it on. Is it very long? Two hours, 20. Ohhh. Mmm, no, I'll wait. TV: 'You wouldn't steal a handbag...' Oh, these piracy warnings... Oh, these piracy warnings...  Tell me about it. Oh,these piracy warnings...  Tell me about it.  DOORBELL Ah, what now? 'You wouldn't shoot a policeman,  then steal his helmet...' Hello, there. Yes, can I help you? Police! Don't move! Ah, ah. Don't move! If my mouther thinks I'm a cannibal,  I'll be for the high jump If my mouther thinks I'm a cannibal,  I'll be for the high jump  For once, can we please  not bring your mother into it. Oh, here we go again. Oh, here we go again.  DOOR SLAMS Well, boys, we're in a bit of a  sticky situation, aren't we? Where d'you get this film? This is an illegal copy of a film. Ohh, um... Are you not worried that  we might be cannibals? Cannibals? The man who was with us  is a cannibal. He was going to eat me. Well, it's not really my area.  I do copyright violation, that sort of thing, but I'll let someone know.  Thanks. Anyway... Where d'you get this? Interesting film. Who'd have thought at the end  that bloke turned out to be the...
