 Oh, listen, my children and you shall hear of the midnight ride of Paul Rev.. Oops. Wrong poem. Ha-ha-ha. Ahem.

But our plans for the holiday were soon to change Boy, speaking in rhymes can really sound strange. Oh, dear! Eight thousand dollars! Where can it be? If I can't find this money, our business will be ruined. It's got to be here somewhere.

 Then into the town, we arrived with such clatter. Just to get into this thing We needed a ladder. Come on, boys. This is no time to play in the snow. - Sister! - Brother! And who do we have here? Why, this is my little Tweety bird. My, isn't he a cute one? Uh, come in, come in. Now, who could that be? Willie, this is my pooch, Hector. Hector, this is your Uncle Willie. [grunting And this is my kitty, Sylvester. Sylvester, give your Uncle Willie a kiss hello. Mwah! And these are my pets. Hubie and Bertie. Well, they're my kissin' cousins. Sylvester! It isn't polite to eat family. Been there, done that. Now, brother, sit down and tell me what this is all about. Oh, sister, this is a pickle. This is a pickle. 'Today's the day that I make our weekly deposit at the bank.' 'Th-this week's deposit was $8000.' I counted it carefully, th-then put it in a yellow envelope and went right to the bank. When I got there, the money had disappeared. Oh. That is a mystery. Hm? Now, Willie, are you sure you went straight to the bank? I'm sure, I'm sure. Oh, sure, sure. We're going to have to retrace your footsteps. Get your coat. Time's a-wastin'. Say, is that cat as stupid as he looks? Stupider. Sylvester, you found Willie's footprints. Good kitty. We took to the town to look for the dough. Seems old Willie's memory was only so-so. Straight to the bank, eh? Uh? Oh. Ha-ha-ha. I-I came in here for a newspaper. Mr. Bowers, I'm Granny, Willie's sister. Do you remember seeing him earlier today? Do I? He came in here this morning. Guess he must've thought he was at the library 'cause he stood reading every magazine I got. Look at that mess. Subscription cards everywhere. I hate subscription cards. But did he purchase anything? 'He had a sarsaparilla.' 'Oh, and he bought a newspaper.' 'He didn't read it, though. Ha.' 'Folded a yellow envelope inside it and left.' Come, brother, let's get back on the trail while it's still cold. 'I just got over a cold.' 'Licked it with lots of vitamin C.' 'I hate vitamin C.' Hey, Willie, here's your keys. You dropped them here earlier. I hate keys. The search for the money went full speed ahead. While visions of burly dogs danced in my head. Thud Now, sister, I'm sure I.. Bang Oh, goodness. I.. Really, Willie, you should pay attention to where you're goin'. Granny's patience was melting like cheese for fondue. When all of a sudden old Will dropped a clue. 'Hmm?' And to where you've been. You saw a movie today, Willie? Uh, well.. Hmm? Hmm? Not just a movie. A film festival. Starring Curly. He's my favorite. Come on, you knucklehead. 'Now, from here you went directly to the bank, right?' Right. Right after I mailed my Christmas cards. Christmas cards? Hello! It is Christmas, sister. Had he made the deposit and simply forgotten? Had his brain been replaced with potatoes au gratin? Huh? Oh, well, the money isn't in here. But, look, I found your Christmas card. Say, Willie, thanks for the fabulous tip this morning. Oh, that wouldn't happen to be an $8000 tip, would it? Ha, ha. That's rich. More like 8 cents. Now, let me get this straight. You took a cab somewhere? That's right. Took him over to Rossi's, on the edge of town. Pile in. 'That'll be 1.90.' Oh, here you go. Keep the change. Ooh, a whole dime. You two are gonna spoil me. Hey, Willie, I almost forgot. You left something in my cab earlier. A yellow envelope? No. Your horse. 'Uncle Willie.' You back for another hot chocolate? And who is this lovely lady you bring with you? 'This is my sister, Granny.' 'Mwah! Let me get you the best table in the house.' 'No, no, we can't stay. We're looking for something.' 'Do you mean you're on some kind of a scavenger hunt?' That's not quite the way we see it. Ah, you must mean what Willie left here this afternoon, eh? I put it right over here. Just like you left it. Gee, and it's not even Saturday night. Now, Willie, are you sure this was your last stop for the day? Sure as the day is long, sister. Sure as the day is long. The days are pretty short this time of year. Daily? What are you doing back here? That's for me to know and you to find out, Totter. What's it gonna be this time, Daily? Trying to get a free toaster without opening an account? You're not a very nice guy, are you? Meanest man in town. Come back here, my little sugarplums. Aa-ha! Frozen with fr-fr-fr-fright. [teeth clattering See what happens when you don't floss every day? Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Right. I've misplaced my deposit. Eight thousand smackers. What kind of scam are you running, anyway? Coming in here to make a deposit with no money. Don't you know that's against the law? Get out. Get out of my bank. Come on, brother. The service at this bank stinks. Look. The newspaper. Yeah. My favorite Christmas color. Green. 'Totter's depositing Uncle Willie's money' into his own account. Yeah, yeah, yeah. On account of he's a crook. - We gotta do something. - Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Whoo! How did we ever let 'em talk us into this one? - 'Oof!' - Who's there? - Woah! - Santa? Ho-ho-ho! Well, what did you bring me? What did you bring me? It's beautiful. It goes with my eyes. Ho-ho-ho. Ho-ho.. Aah! Aah! Hey. I guess that's why they call it a flue. Heh, heh. On Dasher, on Dancer, on Nordhoff, on Roscoe. Pom pom Aw, pussy, this is no time for a catnap. We gotta get this newspaper to Granny. Oh, let's admit it, sister. The money is gone. I'm ruined. There, there, Willie. We have to keep sleuthing. The answer isn't going to just hit you out of the blue. Aah! You've got some newspaper delivery service around here. Hmm. "Elvis beams down from alien ship?" Let me see that. 'A sarsaparilla stain..' '...a grease stain from a cab door' a hot chocolate stain from Rossi's. Willie, this must be the newspaper you bought earlier. You're right. So that means.. The money. Oh, you must have been mistaken, sister. Look, right here it says, "From the desk of Freddy T. Totter." Freddy T. Totter. Mr. Totter, my brother and I have reason to believe that you have the missing $8000. I don't know what you're talking about. And I thought I told you to stay out of my bank. Hmph! Heh, ha. How do you suppose that got there? You took that money to try to put my brother's business out of business. You never miss a trick, do you, Totter? Well, you're gonna miss this one. So, what if I did take the money? What's wrong with that? Totterville, that's what I wanted. A whole town owned and operated by me. That's right, me, me, me. Fred Totter, ha-ha-ha, the meanest man in town. Oh, Merry Christmas, desk. Merry Christmas, fireplace. Merry Christmas, pussycat. And a happy New Year to you, in jail. Maybe I'd better hold on to this. Come on, Granny. If we hurry, we can still make the Daily family dinner at my nephew's house. A holiday turkey with all the trimmings. I'll take a drumstick. Or two if they're small. Uh-oh. Ha! With the mystery solved, I took off in a flash I needed that bird to make canary corn hash. Crash - Nice shot, Hubie. Nice shot. - Naturally. They say that every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings. [bells ringing Get me. I'm giving out wings. Hmm!
