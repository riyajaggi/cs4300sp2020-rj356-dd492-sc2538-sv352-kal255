 The wheel has been stolen. We must call the world's greatest detective. - Hey, lady. - Ha-ha-ha! [cell phone rings] (man on phone) 'Monsieur, help us.'

Deliveries go in the rear. Ha-ha-ha. Oh, such a dry wit. I'm Granny, here for the Grand Prix. But first, I must investigate something in the casino. (Sylvester) Sylvester the super sleuth was on the case. Ah, ah, ah. I don't care if you're Princess Di. We have a dress code, n'est-ce-pas? Oh, flibberty-gibbert. [speaks in foreign language] But what about les animaux? (Granny) Voila. [instrumental music] Legasp! [grunts] Welcome, Your Highness. (Sylvester) Yes, sir. Something just didn't smell right. [crowd yelling] Who was that? That was Sheik Tusheik. Hurry. I've got to find that wheel. [grunting] [chuckles] Oh, Sylvester. Come out of there. [sniffs] Oh, land sakes. No more jack mackerel for you. If madame would be so kind as to keep her paws off my good-luck mascot, Pitu Le Pew. And who are you? Lawrence of Arabia? I am the high rolling, fabulously wealthy Sheik Tusheik. I planned to add the wheel to my collection. But now, it is missing. I didn't know the wheel was for sale. It's not. Ooh, I better help Granny find that roulette wheel before the Grand Prix starts. [slot machine ringing] [laughs] [grunting] Jackpot! [slot machine ringing] Ooh. You hit the pussycat pot in birdseed. - Ha! - Dealer plays. You got to know when to bluff and when you played enough. I'm too upset to play. I wanted that wheel. It would be a perfect match for the platinum keno card I picked up in Laughlin. [sniffing] [GRUNTING] Dogs find me compelling, non? (Sylvester) As you can see my associates were clueless. (Silas) 'The birds are all mine.' I have three payments left on these birds. - They're coming with me. - Uh-oh. It looks like I stumbled into a divorce court. You can't leave. Uh, where will you go? What will you do? I'm going back to my old job as a rocket scientist. Can't we discuss this during intermission? I owe it to my public. [snoring] Sorry. I made up my mind. [sniffing] The odds were against me. (Sylvester) At this moment, I did what any self-respecting sleuth would do. [growling] crash I ran like the dickens. [Sylvester yowling] [Hector barking] Where will I ever find someone to fill her sequins? (Sylvester) Then I donned my disguise. Yes! The show will go on. Ooh. Silk looks flattering on pussy. (Silas) Well, don't go, birdie. It's magic time. [screams] [chuckles] [Hector growling] [whirring] Whoops. Pussy's in the puss-o-matic. (Sylvester) I was boxed in but I still had a case to solve. [saw whirring] (Sylvester) Things were bad. Voila. (Sylvester) I pulled myself together and got back to sleuthing. [instrumental music] Hmph. [laughing] The day before the Grand Prix and I've gotta find some exotic roulette wheel. Oh, why do these things always happen to me? [spits] And why do the French put so much onion in their food? [knocking on door] - Who's there? - It's me. The maid. (Sylvester) Another suspect on the scene. Come to turn down your bed. [door closes] Hello? (Sylvester) And so the case took another interesting turn. And another and another and another. Oh. Oh, this case just has my head spinning. 'Stop the bed, I want to get off.' Oh, how do these French get any sleep? No wonder they write such depressing novels. [knock on door] [man speaking in foreign language] (guard) This is the police. Sorry, madame, but an anonymous tip informed us you have the platinum roulette wheel. Oh, that's ridiculous. Oh? Then qu'est que c'estthis? [gasps] I must get out of here and clear my name. For the second half of my show the volcanic hat trick. Mm-mm. Mesquite-smoked canary. Hmm. Lepoof is a dud. Come to papa, you pip-squeak. boom Yipe! A combustible fusillade. [Sylvester yelping] Pussy's hot tonight. [yawns] [yelping] Ah! Legasp! My dream Goddess. What can I say? Pepe Le Pew is my fourth cousin. It runs in the family. [instrumental music] Puppy want a chew bone? All you have to do is bring the sheik good luck. He wins, you get a bone. Get it? (Sylvester) Meanwhile, I returned to the box for more clues. Yeesh! That was close. [screams] [gasps] - Yuck! - Oh, playing hard to get. I like that in a woman. Do you mind? How dare you perforate my pincushion of love. En garde! [instrumental music] (Silas) It's never too late to pursue a career in the fast-growing field of asbestos removal. I know a little place where we can be alone. [screams] Oh, I am love's captive, non? (Sylvester) I was being followed. Granny was being framed. Suffering succotash. They don't build 'em like they used to. Well, here's the problem. Goodness, for something unique these platinum roulette wheels are everywhere. [engine starts] [explosion] I knew we should've rented a Yugo. [siren wails] Lucky for you I know CPR, yes? crash Oh. At least, I've met my deductible. Can you put this baby back together in time for the race? There's a shiny quarter in it for you. Uh, you got yourself a deal. (Sylvester) Aha. The race, the platinum wheel. Perhaps there was a connection. [siren wails] Madame Granny, we meet again. First, you run away then you steal the wheel back from the police. - It's a frame up. - Oh, sure. That's what everyone says who steals a platinum roulette wheel. One has to get up pretty early to get away from the palace guard. [laughs] boom (Sylvester) Obviously, it was all up to me. Ooh. Granny and me are jailbirds on the lam. (Sylvester) Granny was in big trouble. But then again, so was I. [yells] Oh, it's bad luck to see one's bride before the ceremony. But my lips cannot wait one second more. Mine can. (Pitu) 'Wait. We're in the tower suite.' [Sylvester yelling] gulp Return to me, my Goddess. Like I have a choice. [engines revving] swish swish swish Come on, Tweety, the race is starting. Excuse me, could you solve a crime for me? I'm really overbooked this episode. (Sylvester) I told you there was a connection. [engine starts] screech [speaking in foreign language] swish swish swish [revving] screech But I'm supposed to go fast. Police business. I always wanted to say that. Oh, don't fear l'amour, my petunia. I love hanging around with you. [yelling] Do you find this love business has its ups and downs? [yelling] - Oof! - Spread out, pussy. - I'm Granny's copilot. - Aah! whack [grunting] [cars approaching] [screaming] thud Pussycat road pizza. [instrumental music] swish swish swish [Pitu kissing] [Sylvester screams] [yelling] - Unh! - Ooh. Something's wrong with the wheel. Check it out, pussycat. Careful, pussy. Don't get a migraine. - Aah! - 'Pussy go round and round..' And where he stops.. Ah, who cares? [revving] You've been spared, my inner tube of love. Is it just me or do skunk puns stink worse than regular ones? [music continues] [speaking in foreign language] splash You lost it all for me. And how dare you make doggy logs under my chair! kick crash [gasps] [whistle tweets] [crowd cheering] (Sylvester) I was busy circling in on the culprit. Sheesh. What a pain in the asphalt. (guard) Attention. This woman is no winner. She is a thief. But I'm innocent. Then explain this, Granny. The stolen wheel that you've stolen back from me several times. 'And I'm really getting tired of it.' (Sylvester) Just as I was about to put it all together that stupid bird upstaged me. (Granny) 'You see, I thought that th-they, well.. I..' I simply can't.. Wait. Yes, I can. It's all here in this teeny little ball which is magnetic. And since it's platinum 'it can only be the rigged roulette ball' 'that goes with the famed platinum roulette wheel.' (all) Legasp! I'm surprised anyone understood that. I was just winging it. And now, dramatic close-ups of the suspects. (Sylvester) I knew who it was but I couldn't figure out the motive. (Granny) 'There is one person crafty enough' 'to cause all this fuss.' 'Silas Micawber.' (all) 'But why?' The cut-rate Houdini done it. You never forgave me for exposing your fraudulent mind-reading trick, did you? I had to do it. You ruined my career. I could've been an idol. Maybe even on a lunch box like The Dukes of Hazzard. But because of you, I've been reduced to playing dumps like this. Okay, Micawber. You're heading for hard time in the Monte Carlo brig. Only one sauce per meal. What about the wheel? Uh, a little polish, some points and plugs and, uh, she'll be as good as new. A Grand Prix victory. Oh, goodness, what a titillation. Where's Sylvester? Oh, he's around somewhere. Oh. [yelling] thud [waves crashing] Mon amour. We'll never be apart again. Oh, no! Ah, pussy love. [instrumental music]
