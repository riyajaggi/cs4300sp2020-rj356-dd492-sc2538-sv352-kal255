That's right, we're M.I.F.F.E.D.! [indistinct chattering] As you know, we've got no plaid. Without our plaid, we have no kilts. And without our kilts, how can we play in the St. Andrea's golf tournament tomorrow? I just cannot do it, captain. I don't have the power. [instrumental music] Next time, I pack your parachute. He-he-he. Uh, pardon me. Could you tell me where I might find Angus MacRorry? Yeah, ma'am! He's in the back room! Uh, excuse me. Up here. I'm Angus's fourth cousin twice removed, Granny. A real pleasure. I'm Myopia. Follow me. They're discussing what to do about that missing plaid. But if you ask me, it's an awfully silly meeting to have. Now, just because we have no skirts, are we not men? Aye. What to do? Ooh, this is a woodpecker's paradise. Men, our government-sanctioned moments of silence have been answered. Meet my fourth cousin twice removed, Granny. Angus, I got here as soon as I could. Will you help us? A good tailor might be more of a help just now but I'll do what I can. (all) Hip, hip, hooray! [popping] If it's a peep show you're expecting that'll be two bob. (Sylvester) Yes, it was a tad sad to see all the lads clad without plaid. [grunting] [yawning] [gasps] [whimpers] Yike! [whimpering] [ringing] Reservations? Yes, quite a few. Could I have your name? [chuckles] You could, but it'd be quite a coincidence. My, what an interesting coat of arms. Why, thank you. It came with a matching pair of pants. Ah, very good. Granny. [rings] [all gasp] (Sylvester) 'Oh. A giant hairball with eyes.' [growling] [whimpering] (Sylvester) We got no plaid but we're about to get kilt. [growls] [all gasp] Whoa, whoa! Gossamer here will gladly help you with your luggage. [instrumental music] Hmm? [grunts] [grunting] Oh! Ahh. [grumbling] Blasted game! Why, cousin, I thought golf was a game of relaxation. I am relaxed! [grunting] [groaning] Need help! Oooh! Aah! Ow! Oh-ho! Ouch! Aah! Oww! Why, Angus, are you alright? Oh, Granny, I just got word that me partner, Haggis MacRorry has got himself a wee bit of the sniffles and won't be playing with me tomorrow. Oh, nothing serious, I hope. It was his drafty barrel with the knotholes. We tried to plug it up, but I'm afraid it was too late. Well, I'm no Jack Nicholson but I could swing pretty good in my day. You? My golfing partner? [laughing] Well, I'll admit I might be a tad rusty. I guess you're right, cousin. With the tournament tomorrow I suppose I'll have to make do. Now, the first thing you want to do is address the ball. Hello, ball. It's going to be a long day. swish swish swish [sighs] Huh? Uh? Uh? [sighs] Hit me. [Angus yawns] Now, for the millionth time, Granny your head down and your arms straight. Three! I hit it. Aye, you did. Perhaps you could be my partner after all. Well, fire up another one. I'm on a roll. Ooh! But, cousin, that was my only ball. Been in the family for generations. We've got to find it. Hector. 'Come here, boy.' Fetch the ball, Hector. Aye. Good boy, Hector. Big deal. A boomerang that drools. Say, cousin, would you mind if I enlisted your pooch here as my caddy in tomorrow's game? He's a fine retriever, he is. Would you like that, Hector? [muttering] [snoring] Oh, Heathcliff. Ha-ha-ha! [both snoring] [chirping] [Bagpipes music at distance] I think it's time for me to bag those pipes. Mm. Time for a post-midnight snack. [bagpipe music continues] Hah! Ah! biff [groans] Shh! [bagpipe music continues] (Tweety) 'This looks like some fancy washing machine.' [crackling] [instrumental music] [crackling] 'I bet this is leading up to something.' Ooh, puddy, will you look at all that plaid? [man laughing] I've done it. I've done it. I've reduced the entire MacRorry clan tartan into one single drop. 'Gossamer, turn off that blasted bagpipe music.' Now, be a good assistant and bring me the concentrated liquid plaid. 'Be very careful, Gossamer. It's highly volatile.' [whimpering] [sighs] [humming] [grunting] No! Aah! Aaah! Aaah! [grunting] [sighs] No one will ever look for it here. Come, Gossamer. I'll treat you to some warm milk and graham haggis. [chuckling] Puddy, we gotta get that ball and bring it to Granny. What's this "We" stuff? You want it, you get it. I'm sure Granny would love to see this. [gasps] Why, you little yellow blackmailer. Ain't I a stinker? [snoring] My fellow Scots, our big day is upon us. And though we have been faced with great adversity it's time to step up and meet the challenge in the grand MacRorry tradition. Are you ready, men? It's a crying shame. Did he say, "Crying Game?" [instrumental music] [men laughing] Ooh, where is she? [grunting] Come on, the tournament's starting. I can hardly MacWait. (Angus) 'Hoot, mon!' Ahh. Ahh. If we can conquer the little Loch Mess the trophy will be ours. Ooh! [screeching] [whimpers] Hmm. Ahh. - Thanks. - Rahh. [gasps] Psst, puddy, do you have that golf ball? What do you think, pip-squeak? I slipped it in my pocket right here. [gasps] It's-it's the ball. Uh-huh? [Hector chuckles] Ha! Aah! Look. Uh-oh. Cousin, if you can't control your animals, you're going to have to leave the course. What's this black speck? "Concentrated plaid?" Aha! The creepy desk clerk is behind that missing plaid. [sobbing] I was blinded by her beauty. It happens. Myopia? It was the plaid that caused your nearsightedness, wasn't it? Why, you're a regular Matlock Holmes. You know, I came into this world with perfect 20-20 vision only to have my sight assaulted every day with plaid. It was just too much for me to take. Take them away, officers. Angus, no! [gasps] Duck and cover, folks. Yipe! [explosion] The missing MacRorry tartan. [instrumental music] Ach! It's lovely. ♪ On the bonnie bonnie banks of Loch Lomond ♪♪ [instrumental music] [theme music]
