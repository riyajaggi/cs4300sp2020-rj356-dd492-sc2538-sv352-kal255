[crowd cheering] [Hector growls] Boys, meet Alba Core, president of Screamcease. Oh, how sweet. My, what intelligent animals. [gasps] [laughing] [instrumental music] Now, then, whom do you suspect? He's an hourly employee. He knows nothing. Personally, I believe Sushihana of Tokyo is behind this. Oh, land sakes alive. Why do you suspect them? As the most famous restaurant in the Ginza district they have a yen for tuna. If you get my meaning. Well, no, but we'll go there anyway. Good. Otherwise the whole story just sits around. [yelling] [speaking in foreign language] (Fishimene) 'Welcome to Sushihana.' I'm Soh Fishimene, host of this honorable restaurant. [chuckling] Watch me crack him. So, Mr. Fishimene, why did you kidnap Charlene the Tuna? But I didn't. Would madam care to order? Was it for ransom? Maybe you needed the money to pay off a blackmailer. Uh, perhaps madam would like a little more time. So you could marry a woman with a sordid past who's trying to reform. Go away. Confess! Oh-ho-ho, that went rather well, I thought. This crime could take a long time to solve. [instrumental music] [Sylvester yells] Ha. No clues in this fishy. No clues in that fishy. No clues in this fishy. [instrumental music] Hmm. I could savor some of these undersea delectables instead of obsessing on that stupid bird. [grunting] I could, but it's tradition. [Tweety sniffs] Boy, it sure stinks inside this fish. Oof! Ooh, a punching bag. Must be for the worms to work out on. [grunts] [groans] [grunting] [moaning] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] Have you become a type of wise guy? Dishonor! [yells] [gasps] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] [indistinct shouting] [all yelling] Oh, my, where's Tweety? Go find Tweety. I'm going to question the suspect. [instrumental music] Young man, you're a toughie. If I didn't know better, I'd think you were innocent. [sniffing] Huh? [screaming] [chefs yelling] [panting] [grunting] Hey. [grunting] Ack! Bad old pussycat. [grunting] [instrumental music] - Ah! - Ah! [grunting] - Ah! - Ah! I hope none of you gentlemen is allergic to pussycats. [indistinct chatter] Please, come back. This rarely happens. Why, thank you, Hector. Fishimene is a tough nut to crack. I'll have to try something else. I'm not sure what, but something is bound to strike me. [dramatic music] Hmm. [hissing] [gasps] Hmm. [arrows whizzing] Oh? Hmm. You'd think something would turn up. [chirping] My, this symbol looks familiar. Is it a secret code from triad gangs on the mainland? Oh. It was just dirt on my glasses. Ah-ha! That symbol stands for the dojo of kendo-master Ichthi Ologi. Wow, Granny knows her stuff. It says so here in a small print. "Learn to chop. "Make the cut in Master Ichthi Ologi's Combat Academy and Sushi School." Of course, it all makes sense. (Ichthi) 'Yes. I wanted Charlene the Tuna.' Excellent chance to prove my sushi-slicing technique. But now no fish. Life is awful like that. Master Ichthi Ologi, how do you explain this? [stammering] I mean, this? Oh. It belongs to my former student, Tunamoto. I had to expel him. He is a very rowdy boy. 'I'll send it to him with the rest of his belongings, COD.' Hmm. Tunaman has fish on the brain. There's the mean old assassin that tried to hurt Granny. [instrumental music] [grunting] A whole room of assassins. I'd better check them all. [grunting] [grunting] Ow! [grunting] [crashing] [grunting] That assassin looks really suspicious. [speaking in foreign language] [chomp] So your student, Tunamoto, wasn't always a troublemaker? Yeow! No. But he started spending time at Water-Land and, uh.. This racket is really ticking me off. [grunting] Bad old pussycat. [crash] Ooh, pussy really know how to catch a cab. That's the last straw. (Sylvester) 'Ow! Ow!' [groaning] You stay out, big red-nose cat. Don't track up my floor. [slurps] Ah, a succulent snack. [gulps] [snarling] [cranking] No, come on. Guess. Guess what it is. We really should be going, Mr. Ologi. I'm afraid we still have a large tuna to find. Tuna not go anywhere. You guess. Oh. Oh, very well. A bird. No. Why bird? It's a giant squid. I made a giant squid. What do you suppose that bad old pussycat up to now? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [instrumental music] Excuse me, young Nasan, but is today your birthday? [gasps] Whatever do you mean most honorable little bird? [dynamite hissing] [explodes] [sighs] Happy birthday to me. [grunting] There you are, Tweety. I was so worried. We should be off now and find Charlene. [crash] [growls] [gasps] Tunamoto. Oh, dear. A ninja's work is never done. [yells] Ooh, you big bully. Why don't you pick on someone your own size? [yells] You mind your manners, young fella, and your breath. [growls] [yells] (Sylvester) Now, who'd be so irresponsible as to give a machete to a baby? [dramatic music] Uh-oh. Land sakes alive, you might have hurt someone with this. [crying] I've been pantsed. There, there, Tuna san, tell Granny all about it. [crying] Very well. That was easy. I stole the big tuna to sell to a mysterious tuna tycoon. And just where did you plan to meet? At the Sashimi.. ...a downtown-Tokyo hot spot. Uh, sorry. No unpaid endorsements on this show. Uh, one more thing. Where's Charlene? [whispering indistinctly] Gracious, that's very clever. [grunting] [instrumental music] One more little stop and, uh.. ...this case is in the can. And now, my friends, who are gathered here for fun 'let's all do the umbrella.' [instrumental muisc] [Sylvester growls] You behave or you'll be padding a violin case next. Now, all we have to do is wait for Tunamoto's contact. That slimy fishnapper. [slurps] Somehow, I expected you to be larger. I've been sick. I'm looking for a woman named Charlene. Oh, I hear she's a real catch. But sometimes it's, uh, catch-as-catch-can. I have a can opener right here. [gasps] Alba Core? Thought you could outfox me? Hector, sic her. Bartender, get me the police and charge my drink to Alba Core. Huh? Huh. Huh? [ripping] Ah. Huh? [slurping] Oh! [grunting] [Alba growls] Gotcha. Oof! [grunting] [microphone squeaks] [grunting] [growls] [clamoring] Ooh. [instrumental music] [indistinct yelling] [whack] [applauding] Caught red-handed. I'd do anything to save my giant fishy-whishums. Charlene should be free. Free to stay at my place. No one's ever going to eat you my poor giant fishy-wishy-whooshy. [sighs] [gasps] [thuds] [grunting] [grunting] It's amazing what they can vacuum-pack into a can these days. I think it's time to wrap up this fish story. [laughing] Wanna bet? [engine rumbling] Come on, after him. Let's get him. [indistinct yelling] This sort of thing only happens 'cause pussy never eats a properly balanced meal. [instrumental music]
