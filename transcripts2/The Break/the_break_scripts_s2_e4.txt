 -Can I open them? -Wait. -I'm going to open them. -Just wait. -Claudine, I can't breathe! -We're nearly there. One second... Here we go. And... there. You can open them. Surprise. Speechless? What is this thing? An RV.

 Holy crap. Terra Nova, isn't that what you wanted? -You bought it? -Yeah. -Shit. -The seller knocked off 10%. Try not to look so enthusiastic. No, sweetie, it's not that. It's great, it's just... people are going to talk, they're going to say... You're such a killjoy! Come on, let me show you this beast. Everything's electronic. Integrated dishwasher. Electric armchair. TV. Heated bed.

 And there's even Wi-Fi! And, wait for it... -Amazing, right? -Yes. It's terrific. I just think we should wait a while before using it. Fuck me, Tino. Right now? Yes, right now. I'm in the mood. BANK Focus. What did the woman look like? Was she blonde? Brunette? A redhead? I don't know. She had ID, I didn't ask her any questions. Sorry, I know I screwed up. Verelst, what's on the videos? Nothing much. Two of them didn't record and the one in the parking lot is filming trash cans. How useful. The wind must've moved it. So, all I have is this: a bit of her taillight. We can't even read the license plate. It's an old Beetle. My father had one like that. Zoom in a bit on the sticker. What's that? It looks like a... a boar. I told you not to put it like that. You know, Inspector, anyone could've emptied that safe. It's her sister, Verelst. She had access to her ID, her clothes, her accounts. It must be her. But what I don't get is why she'd try to pass off as her sister if she knew she was the heir. Ah, I have a match. Brenda. Bastogne. That's not too far. She's cute, huh? Yes. Very pretty, yes. Inspector... have you ever made love to a chubby woman? For me, it's the sexiest thing. Oh, yeah. My first girlfriend was. And I can tell you that in the bedroom, there were fireworks. Oh, yeah. Oh, God. Where did du Tilleul stand on this new road? She was against it. Against it? Yeah, against it. She was blocking everything. Works are well underway. We can still add a road, but we must act fast. Any administrative blips and our hands will be tied. You'll have authorizations for anything town-related within the week. -You can count on me. -Very well. We were told about a group of activists in the forest? Yes, they'll be gone soon. Besides, if we start works, won't they be forced to leave? Just know that we can't afford to slow down works. No, don't worry. If they lose support, they'll leave, I guarantee it. What's this? 80? That's the price. There's been a misunderstanding. I want 120. -120? -I looked into it, that's the price. 120 is for buildings. Exactly. But we're building a road. And I want 120. Listen, it makes no difference to us! If the road isn't in Musso, it'll be in Matrival! 80, take it or leave it. Very well. I'll leave it. If you want my land, it's 120. Shit. Here, I got you this. Cool! And the Holy Grail. This is fricking awesome! Thanks. Oh, I got you this too, it's for you. You're a goddam lifesaver. I'm not sure how you get by, but I thought it could be of use. For sure. I'm gonna stash it away, if Boris sees it, he'll kill me. He doesn't like things from the outside. -Boris, is he your leader? -Yeah. He's insane, but he's uptight about consumption. Food, packaging and pollution stress him out. OK. He pushes for self-sufficiency: to only use what we produce. That's cool. Yeah, it's cool... But he doesn't have to stuff moss in his panties every month. No. Seriously? What am I supposed to wear during my period? Ferns? Damn, that must be itchy. Totally. It's awful. To be honest, I'm kind of over his freakouts. Last time, he took Manu's toothbrush just because it was new. He needs to chill. Wanna see something? OK. Come. My boyfriend stole tents from the shop. You can have one if you like. Yeah, for sure. PHUCK THE POLICE Don't you think we should run DNA tests? On who? I don't know... on her sister, her husband, the doctor, everyone. We have five unknown DNAs. But we have one known one. And he admitted to it. Yes, but in court, Dany's DNA won't hold up against the five others. I think we should run a test to conclusively rule them out. Yeah, but, it'll cost a fortune. There's really no point. I think you should talk to Gobert. I'll look like an idiot again. Captain Gobert? It's Inspector Briquet, is this a good time? I could call back later. Well, my colleague and I thought that it might be a good idea to run tests to rule out any unknown DNA for du Tilleul's murder. I told her it'd be expensive... OK, yes. Exactly, it's expensive, but worth it. Otherwise Dany's DNA wouldn't hold up in court. That's what we thought. Every little bit counts. Right, perfect. We'll do that. Great. Yes, you too. Have a good day. Goodbye. We're running the tests. OK. Where were we? You were talking about the safe. Yes. -Do you know what's in the safe? -Yes. I'm not supposed to tell you. I know, but we have reason to believe that the person who emptied the safe killed your client. Gold. -How much? -I don't know. 150, 200,000. I don't know exactly, it's still... a mark left by late Mr. du Tilleul. How did she and her sister get along? Great. But? Listen... Claudine was jealous of Astrid. She could never really come to terms with her sister's success. All that money... But they were sisters, they loved each other. Claudine would never have hurt Astrid. She's beautiful, huh? Does my sister turn you on? Have you ever touched a woman? No? Fuck me. What? What's wrong? -Don't I turn you on? -No, it's just that I... You prefer my sister, is that it? You're just like the others, Dany. Her money gives you a hard-on, doesn't it? You want to fuck a rich woman? No. Why are we here? I thought that Dany had confessed? Is it not him anymore? We found other traces of DNA at the scene and we have to rule them out. That's ridiculous. Ridiculous. You can close your mouth, thanks. You'll obviously find our DNA. We worked in that house. Great job. Our DNA is in every room. Could you open your mouth? And if I refuse? It's up to you, but it would be an obstruction of the investigation and it would make you a suspect. Sorry. Your colleague said it had been settled. Which colleague? The other one. That rude guy who came to bother us at Astrid's funeral. An officer came to your home on that day? Yeah. And did he say his name? Uh... Inspector Meeters, something like that. Can we go now? Yes. Hi, Marjo. All good? Why were you at du Tilleul's? -Do you want to come in? -Answer my question. -I had to see the crime scene. -You have no right to investigate. You're not a cop anymore. Leave it to us. Marjo... He didn't do it, you know he didn't. This kid deserves a chance. He has no alibi, he confessed. No one knows where he went after his appointment. So that makes him guilty? What did we teach you at school, Marjo? Trust your instinct. Why are you interested in this kid? Same reason as you. Old habits die hard. You have no right to investigate anymore. And it's for the best. Things didn't end well last time. I'm warning you, if I catch you again, I won't think twice about arresting you. AUTOPSY REPORT ASTRID DU TILLEUL So... On the one hand, we have Astrid du Tilleul. A house, 15 hectares of forest. Then there's her sister, blacklisted by the bank her husband's crippled with debt and they owe 15,000 euros in taxes. She lives at her sister's house, surrounded by all of this money. But they were in Hamburg when she died. Exactly. But they could've easily hired someone to kill her. Shouldn't you slow down a bit? If she didn't do it, she paid someone else to do it. Are you OK? I gave the prison officers a little package to pass on to you. There are cookies, coffee... crackers, honey. I put cigarettes in there. Your radio too. Here's 40 euros. Christian contributed too. He sends his love. I don't want you to come anymore. -Why are you saying that? -Just don't come here anymore. Dany... Guard! What are you doing? -Guard! -Dany! Calm down. What's going on, Bastin? I want to go back to my cell. -For God's sake. -Dany, what's gotten into you? Dany, wait! Dany! So? Dany doesn't want to see us. It's cuz of that shrink. That goddam bitch. She filled his head with crap. I'm gonna wreck her goddam face! Calm down, Mom. Goddam bitch. It'd be good to know who she called the day of the murder. We need Alain for the phones. Wait, you don't have a mandate. You haven't changed. Even dead, you're annoying. Excuse me? Dad? Are you there? Remember we're going over to the neighbors'. Shit... The neighbors. Coming! For fuck's sake. Are you making headway? I'd be making more if we didn't have to come here. What? -You know they do bottles too? -Camille... You know what a bottle is? It's practical, round, you put liquid inside, use a cork... Don't, I'm already this close to leaving. Stop moaning, it'll be fun. Just so you know, at 9:30 p.m., I'm out. Whether dinner's over or not, I'm out. Let the circus begin. Hello! -Hello, come in. -Hello, Mrs. Liang. Mr. Peeters, we've been looking forward to having you over for ages. Us too. We're delighted. We're happy to have you over for dinner. We're happy too, right, Dad? Yes, very happy. Good, very good. It's nice of you to have brought wine. Yes, I brought Ventoux. It's very good, it goes with everything. -Since I didn't know what we were having. -Horse. Great! Enjoy. You can add sauce if you want. And your friends? -What friends? -The two plates there, who are they for? Oh, that! Those are for Nils and Rebecca, they're my husband's friends. We're not waiting? They're already here. My husband sees the dead. He's able to talk to the other side. -Your husband talks to the dead. -It's a gift he developed recently. He became friends with this couple. They're very funny! If you want, my husband could put you in touch with someone who has passed. No, thanks, that's very kind. Perhaps you want to speak to a loved one, someone who left too early? No, it's fine. That's very kind. You shouldn't be scared of me, Mr. Peeters. Camille, would you like to talk to your mom? No, thanks. -Are you sure? -She said she didn't want to. Yoann, you shouldn't feel guilty. It's not your fault that Drummer's dead. You didn't kill him. Camille, we're leaving. Drummer's not mad at you, Yoann. He knows that what happened wasn't your fault. Shut up. I think it'd be good for you to talk to him. Shut your goddam mouth! We're leaving. Fucking nutjobs! Sorry, Dad. -No, don't worry. -I'm sorry. Don't worry, come here. You lied to me. Your wife didn't die of leukemia, she died because of you! Tell me what I'm doing here. Tell me. Tell me. Yoann... you know why you're here. You're here because you killed him, Yoann. You're here because you killed Sébastian Drummer. Heads up, I'm not supposed to sell alone. If Boris finds out, he'll kill me. -Careful. -Yeah. Meet our little virgin forest. Fuck! There are thousands! My friend used to plant stuff, but he had three sad plants. -May I? -Yeah. -What? -Come on! OK. Yeah, I told him. No, I told you a thousand times. Keep your mouth shut! I don't give a shit! Marco doesn't know, he can't know. Nobody can. If you talk, I'll kill you! One word and I'll kill you! Like a piece of shit. Who brought this? Nobody's leaving till I have a name. I told you: if the road folks find out that we're growing pot, they'll have an excuse to get rid of us. Is that clear? OK. If no one comes forward, I'll randomly smash someone's face in. Does that sound good? Yes, Fabrice? Got something to say? -No. -Yes, speak up. You've been squirming around for ten minutes. It may not be someone from the community who... Who what, Fabrice? -It could be someone else who... -Did this drop from the sky? No, it didn't drop from the sky. You've got to pick a side, Fabrice. -You're either with us or against us. -I'm with you! Anyone else got something to say? Hello? Yeah, it's Alain. I'm with Rudy. We tracked du Tilleul's sister's phone. We found something strange with her phone ping. It'd be good if you came to see us. OK. I traced her cell phone and your girl was telling the truth. They were in Germany on May 17th. They left Hamburg on May 18th at 9 a.m. They crossed the border at 2:30 p.m. But that's not all. You'll like this: their cell phones pinged at du Tilleul's house at 4:03 p.m., but your girl called the emergency services at 5:36 p.m., an hour and a half later. What did they do in that time? Dunno, you should go ask them. I'll never get a warrant for that. There's no need, I'm not a cop. Hello. Hello. Don't say anything, Tino. He has no business being here. Hello, Mrs. Sevrin. Need to unwind? This is private property, Inspector. If you don't have a warrant, get lost. You're happy she's dead. -Seeing her floating there turned you on. -That's enough. Everyone knows you were at war with your sister. You hated her. You think it's easy being her sister? Claudine! They've always compared us. My sister hated me, she despised me. She's always despised both of us. Claudine. So, yes, I'm happy she's dead, yes. I'm relieved. -I'm not the one who killed her. -You're lying. Why wait an hour and a half before calling for help? Were you covering your tracks? We know that you were there earlier, your phones pinged at 4:03 p.m. We ransacked the house. You what? We panicked, we didn't know what to do. I wanted to find her will. Tino! Look in her bedroom! To be sure that I wasn't disinherited. I can't find it! Shut up, Tino. Keep looking! Holy crap, Tino. Holy crap, Tino, it's me. I'm inheriting the lot. I wanted to see the will before calling the police. It made no difference to her... She was dead anyway. Oh, my God. You don't know what it's like... to live in that woman's shadow. Six years of constant humiliation in this house. I didn't take that for nothing. There's one thing I don't get. If you knew you were the heir, why did you empty out her safe? What safe? Her safe at the bank. I didn't empty out a safe. You can check. I've never been to her bank. Instead of shopping at the junk shop nearby, he took his cart to the bathroom! How idiotic is that? No, it's true. And little Patrick... Oh, little Patrick, I like him! -Where were you? -I went to see my dad. This is my Camille. -Cheers! -Motherfucking Camille. Got any paper? -I'm going to take a shower. -Stay with us, you just got here. I'm filthy. I'll be back. You really are filthy. How did you get so dirty? It's nothing, I fell. Have fun. Yeah. IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU. Hello? Yeah, it's me, Pierrot. Where are you? We've been waiting for five minutes. What? No, we can't do Thursday! We're going to get screwed! Hello? Hello? Fuck. He's not coming, it's too dangerous. He wants to do the exchange on Thursday! It'll be too late. I'm sure Boris picked up on it. Hey, don't worry. He didn't pick up on anything, OK? He isn't as smart as he makes out. Let's pack this up. I hope you're happy with yourself. Mrs. Bastin... -I knew it was your fault. -I just want to help Dany. What else have you put in his head, bitch? Nothing. You're not his mother, Dr. Orban. I'm his mother. Stay out of it. -I'll be right back. -Thanks. Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. What are you going to do now? You want me to talk to her? No. It's nothing. She's stressed. It's normal, it's her son. Sorry I called you. I panicked in the moment, I feel stupid now. I'll give you a lift. That's nice, but I'll be fine. I insist, I'd be happy to. Bye, Yoann. Thanks for the lift. I... I wanted to say... Yes? I mean, if you want... until all this gets sorted out, you could come live with me. At my house, I mean. It's a big house, there are two spare rooms. That's very kind. It won't be a five star hotel, but it'll be nicer than your hotel. Think about it. It's not a problem for me. It's a big house. You won't even have to see me. Thanks, that's very kind. I'll think about it. Bye, Yoann. See you tomorrow. Bye. Couscous is incredible. Ten minutes in the microwave and it's like you're in Marrakesh. What? Du Tilleul's phone records the day she died. So, she tried to call this number, one, two, three... Seven times. An hour before she died. Then she sent two texts to this same number. Alain, can you tell me whose number it is? It's two centimeters... Guys, this isn't a brick-laying workshop, it's a sewing one. Claude, what are you doing? Take it out and put it behind. And again. Take your needle out. No, the needle and put it on top. It's too far. Do it with the needle. Go on, start again. Settle down! Cut it out! Stop! Go back to your seat! -Hello? -Yes, it's me, Rudy. I'm with Alain, we've checked the phone pings. Yeah? Du Tilleul tried to call a number several times before she died and Alain found out whose it was. And? It's Dany Bastin. What? He didn't answer, she sent him several texts, Alain was able to decrypt them. She asked him to go to her house urgently. Sorry, Yoann. I think Dany went to du Tilleul's place the afternoon of her death. Where were you the night of Mrs. du Tilleul's death? I was at the lookout. You can trust him.
