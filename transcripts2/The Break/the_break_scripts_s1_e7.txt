 - Arsenal? - Yeah, Arsenal. Are you crazy? Any club in the world, and you'd choose Arsenal? Arsenal. Or Manchester United, like Cantona. Come on, man, not the Brits. Not the limeys. But England has the best championship in the world. - The jury's still out on that one. - How? Best stadium, best supporters. Shit! No-one gives a damn about the supporters. But we live for the supporters. You score a goal at Old Trafford and the stadium's full, full of supporters. You score. They scream!

 "Driss Assani! Driss Assani!" "Fischer! Fischer!" It's just a bunch of drunk guys, yelling... What about you? If you could play anywhere, where would you go? - Real. - Real Madrid? In a heartbeat. I'm not stupid. If I could play for any club, one, I'd go where the money is, two, I'd go somewhere with hot girls, and three, I'd go somewhere that's sunny. You get hot girls in England too. - English girls are fat. - I've seen pretty ones on TV. Yeah? Did you see their thighs?

 They're like this! Forget it, they're lard-arses. They eat fish and chips all day long. Forget English girls. No, you should go to Spain like me. Spanish girls don't eat fast food and they dance flamenco all day. I'm telling you, I'd choose Real every time. Then I'd buy myself a big Porsche Cayenne and I'd fuck anything that moves. Kevin, I'm telling you as a friend, you need to quit drinking. You'll get yourself killed. You're crazy. You know Penelope Cruz? Driss? Driss! Fuck! Fuck! Driss! Yeah? Morning, baby. I want you so much. - I can't. - Why not? - I have to go. - Where to? - I'm running late. - Five minutes! - No. - Won't you tell me? I told you, I'm fine. Your mum's gone out. You can stay five minutes. No. - Baby? - Not now. - Can't you tell me... - Not now, please. Kevin... I'll come to your place tonight, but not now. Sorry. Camille? It's Dad. Listen... I'm sorry about yesterday. I'm really sorry. Please call me back. I'm worried. - We're ready, so... - OK, I'm coming. I'm coming. Hello, Steven. Did you do this drawing? It's very pretty. I like the red house. I'm going to ask a question and I'd like you to answer me, OK? Did you write this? Steven... We know you wrote this, but that's OK. It's great. It's very pretty. You just need to tell us who told you to write it. Understand? Who were you with when you wrote this? It's very important that you tell me who told you to write this. You understand? Who told you to write this? Who? - Just tell me... - Come on, he didn't write it. - You can tell it wasn't him... - Please. Leave him alone. He's got nothing to do with this. - Who was it, Steven? - Leave him alone! - Please. - Stop asking him. I'll ask whatever I want. I'll ask whatever I want. Who told you to write this? For Christ's sake! You're scaring him! - Get her out of here. - We're leaving. Leave him alone. How long have you been taking your medication? A few months. Who prescribed it? My GP, Dr Boileau. - You're on a course of treatment? - Yes. Treatment for what? After my wife died, I had a difficult time. Had you taken any before? No. What exactly do you take? Antidepressants. - Nothing else? - No. - You're sure? - Yes, I'm sure. I spoke to Dr Boileau. He doesn't recall prescribing you anything. I saw the test results. They were like a drug addict's after an overdose. I want to see Camille. What exactly were you taking? How frequently? - Answer me... - You promised I could see her. What mixture were you taking? Appetite suppressants, stimulants, Reductil, Ephedrine... Sometimes stuff to help me sleep - Rohypnol, Dormicum, anything. I don't remember. It never affected my judgment. Never. Inspector, what you took didn't just affect your faculties... - I want to see Camille. - You should have replaced yourself. I need it! You could have avoided all this. Dad Hi, this is... Are those the tiles? Beautiful. You're good at this. - What's that? - More birds. More birds. Green birds? Green birds are rare. Thanks. Where were you on the 14th and 15th? At the carnival, like everyone else. We were at the Tourniquet. What's that? A bar. Where did you go after that? Nowhere. - You stayed at the Tourniquet all day? - Yeah. - With Steven? - Yeah. - And when did you get home? - I don't remember. - Roughly. - I said I don't know... Around 8pm, around midnight, around 3am? Around 3am. - Was the boy's father there? - What father? - Doesn't Steven have a father? - No. We don't see that arsehole any more. And in this bar was Steven ever left alone with anybody? I don't know. It's possible. Think. It's important. There was a bouncy castle outside. Steven spent the whole night on it. Who else was on it? Well, there was... I can't remember. OK. Thank you. I want a list of everyone in that bar and their alibis for the 14th. But the whole village was at the bar that day. - Yes, and? - It could get complicated. - Do you have a better idea? - No. Get me that fucking list. You killed Willems' cows. We know that. Did you kill Jean-Jean's cows too? Yeah. And Philipart's barn... Did you burn Philipart's barn? Did the guys from the dam tell you to burn the barn? Jeoffrey, I know this isn't easy for you. You're not the sharpest knife in the drawer. But you can't hide behind that. You can't. You have to talk. Philipart is dead. You understand? Dead. So talk! - I didn't. - You didn't what? - I didn't burn Philipart's barn. - Then who did? Jeoffrey, you need to talk. Who burned the barn? It was Driss. It was Driss. Can I help you? It's an excellent model. 60cm blade, 2.7kg. Very easy to handle. You won't find a better hedge trimmer. Is the blade tough? Very. It cuts through anything. Anything? Well, those blades are laser-cut and sharpened with diamond. - Nothing can withstand that. - You're sure? Well, it depends what you want to cut. Something very tough. It can cut branches up to 28mm. I don't think you'll be disappointed. 28mm. That's pretty deep inside the tree. No. Do you sell acid? Acid? - Yes. - This way. He called me on Sunday as he was leaving the club. He said he'd finished and he would walk home. And he'd be home for dinner. That was the last I heard from him. Do you have any idea where he might have gone? No. He's never done this before. I'm sorry to have to ask you this... What was your relationship with Mr Vanhoutte? We're married. You haven't argued recently? No. Why? To your knowledge... was your husband involved in anything... extra-marital? In what way? Does he have a mistress? I'm only asking for the inquiry. He hasn't answered his phone for two days. Two days, and nobody has heard from him. My husband does not have a mistress. Something serious has happened to him. I understand and I sympathise completely. But the problem is... Your husband is an adult, so legally my hands are tied. He has the right to disappear if he so wishes. - You're not going to investigate? - Madam, it's carnival season. He wouldn't be the first person to disappear for a weekend. How old is he? Sir, please calm down. I'm just asking who was in charge of the bouncy castle. Yes, I know what a clown is. But there must have been at least 150 clowns in Heiderfeld that day. OK, thanks. Call me back. Thank you. Good bye. Idiot. - Were you at the carnival? - No, I couldn't go. I spent the weekend in Bruges on a profiling training course. Shame. It looked a lot of fun. They even had an "Italy" float. I don't get why people dress up. Because it's fun. Garish colours in the rain... So depressing. - Drummer? - Yes? The car that hit Driss was a Toyota, right? Yeah. A 4x4. - Any idea what colour? - White or beige. Why? My God... Did you find something? I saw Alain. I mean, the one from the hamburger stand. He was with Maryse and Ponpon. - Ponpon? - Their dog. Mayor Fischer, was she there at the Tourniquet? - Yeah, I think so. - Was she ever alone with Steven? Brigitte and Steven? Yes, it's possible. - Does Steven know her? - She's his godmother. Marie. Everything OK? So... we have two more signatures. That makes 25 - more than enough to get the council's approval. Excellent. We have to bring the vote forward. Do you think that's possible? You can call an emergency meeting. The legal waiting period is two weeks. Great. We'll do that. That way it's over and done with. I'm sorry but I can't arrange the meeting. Really? I'm handing in my notice. I'll finish working on the sports centre, but I'm leaving the dam project. What? There are too many irregularities. I want out. I saw that even Willems had signed. I don't know how you convinced him and I don't want to know. I'm sorry. You OK, Inspector? Lost something? - Why did you change your bumper? - Excuse me? - Your bumper, you've changed it. Why? - You're into cars now? - Answer my question. - I didn't change the bumper. - It's brand new. - What is this, a safety test? And Steven? We could talk about your little letter. - How you used an autistic kid. - What do you mean? - Why did you change your bumper? - I don't like your tone. - Why did you change your bumper? - I didn't... What are you doing? Get off me. Don't touch me! You have no right to do this. Get off me. - I'm arresting you for murder. - Have you lost your mind? You're crazy. What's wrong with you? - What did you do the night of the 14th? - I want to speak to my lawyer. Where were you on the 14th? You were at a staff meeting until 6pm. Is that right? I want to speak to my lawyer. What did you do after that? Did you see Driss? Did you see Driss? - Call her lawyer. - I did. He's on his way. - And the car? Anything from the lab? - They're busy. - They say the bumper was changed... - Peeters. I know, I don't have a warrant. But her car is at the lab. She probably hit Driss. I'll do it. I'll talk to her. Oh, Rudy, it's you. This is a nightmare. Peeters has lost his mind. He arrested me in front of everyone. Can you imagine? What's going on? You used me, Brigitte. What? The dead cows. The dam. You used me. - What are you talking about? - Don't take me for an idiot. I know about Philipart. I know Driss killed him, under your instructions. You've changed, Brigitte. I loved you. Rudy, you've got it wrong. It was my associate, Jean Pera. I introduced him to Driss, nothing more. Pera said he just wanted to scare Philipart. Philipart was holding everything up. We had to persuade him. You realise what you're saying? This is a murder we're talking about. I know. Nobody knew Philipart was in the barn. It was an accident. - And Driss was an accident too? - Driss? That had nothing to do with it. I don't know what happened to Driss. I do. After the accident Driss became a problem. So you got rid of him. Right? No, no, no. - I don't know. Rudy... - It was your car that hit him. That's impossible. There aren't too many white 4x4s round here. The lab results are on their way. We know you have a motive. So stop denying it. I didn't kill him. You know me. Rudy, it's me. I didn't kill him. What did you do after the staff meeting? I don't know... I... I went to the Renards' place. - In the car? - No, no. I walked there. The road was blocked off for the carnival. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Brigitte... - I didn't take the car. It was at home in the gara... What? It wasn't you, was it? It wasn't you who used the car on the 14th. Drummer. Ludmilla, are you still there? OK. Please, listen to me. This is important. I'm in deep shit. Go into my room. Yes. I'm in there now. There's a black bag under the bed. A bin bag. Found it. There's another bag inside it. Take that one. - Got it. - Good. Don't open it. Leave it closed and come and meet me. We're going to Spain, OK? We're going to live in the sun. - Grab your things and come and find me. - OK. Hi, this is Camille. I'm not here at the moment... You know, I can't believe Kevin would be behind all this. We don't even know it was the same car. A 4x4, a white Toyota with a new bumper. You can wait for the lab but I say it's the right car. - You're making assumptions. - It's our job to make assumptions. He doesn't have the profile of a killer. - Nobody does. - Yes, but I know Kevin well. - He isn't capable... - Stop thinking like that. You think you know him but you don't. You don't know anyone. Anybody is capable of killing. People are worse than you think. My money. Give it to me. Give me my money, Markus. - Don't be stupid. - Give it to me, or you're dead. - I don't have it here... - Don't fuck me around! I'm not, Kevin. I don't have it here. We're in deep shit, Markus. All because of you. Fuck! OK, we're on our way. They've located Kevin. - That way, sir. - He went down there. - Over to the left! - To the left. Kevin? We know you're there. Come down. Let's talk, calmly. I didn't do anything. It was an accident. We don't mean any harm. We just want to ask a few questions. Don't worry. Come down. Kevin? - Wait here. I'll go and find him. - No, don't. Call for back-up. It's too dangerous. Those are the Lauzelle cliffs. He can't escape. You'll break your neck. You're risking both your lives. Peeters, wait! Fuck... Oh, fuck... - Stay back. - Calm down. Put the gun down. It was an accident. I swear it was. - I know, Kevin. - Driss was my friend. I didn't mean to kill him. Put the gun down. Come on. Come back. Stop. Get back. - Kevin... - Back! - Calm down... - Get the fuck back! - Give me the gun. - No! Give me the gun... He slipped. Hello? Kevin? It's me. I'm in the car park. Where are you? Damn it. Excuse me. My phone battery is flat. Could I borrow your phone? Get in the car. Thank you. What a waste. I'm sorry. There was nothing I could do. It was out of your hands. He ruined his life all by himself. The lab checked the Toyota. They found Driss's blood on the bonnet. He killed him. I just can't believe it. I've known him since he was a kid. What was he thinking? Go on, go home. You deserve a rest. And I don't want to see you tomorrow. Don't blame yourself. You did what you could. I told you to wait. I told you to wait, and you know it. It's your fault he's dead. - We had no choice. - We did have a choice! And you made the wrong one. We should have waited for back-up. But no, you had to play cowboy, and now he's dead. Kevin is fucking dead. Now I see why they fired you in Brussels. Drummer. You think I killed that kid. No. That's why I'm here. Right? Right... You think I was out of my mind on medication. That I went crazy and killed him. Am I right? - No, I don't think that. - Have you ever been out in the field? The kid fell, right in front of me. That's what it's like. That's reality. We know it was an accident, Inspector. The kid was fucking armed. I couldn't let him go, I had to stop him. I did my job as best I could. That's all. We know you take your job very seriously... Fuck! Will you stop talking to me like a child? I'm sick of your empathy. Calm down. Sit down and control your temper. Calm down? You want me to calm down? You want me to calm down? - Then tell me why I'm here. - You know... No, I don't know why I'm here. So tell me. Tell me why I'm here! Tell me why I'm here. Get off me... Get off me! Mr Pera? We have a warrant. What is this? What's going on? Jean? - How was it? - They were a pain in the arse. Why? Did you talk? No, I didn't say anything. You know I can't stand cops. You OK? Yeah. Should I leave you alone? No. I mean... I'm sorry. We can see each other later if you want. You can eat at my place. Yeah, maybe. It's up to you. If you want to talk, you know where I am. I'm heading off. Bye. OPERATION BERGER FOUR POLICE OFFICERS KILLED Hello? Yes, that's me. I'm her father. I'm sorry. Where is she? I'm her father. - Where are you going? Here... - Let me see her! It's OK. Hello? This is Inspector Drummer. Someone has died. I think Peeters is responsible. Translation: Gill Parrott
