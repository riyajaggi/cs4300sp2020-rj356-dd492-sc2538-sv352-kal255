 I've finished, madam. Did you do the paddock? - Yes, madam. - Leave that there. Get changed. What are you waiting for? Madam? God, this is grisly. What? - Remember the black guy in Heiderfeld? - Yeah. It was the Indian who killed him. The Indian? The hermit in the caravan in the woods. The guy who killed his daughter.

 Yeah? He beat the black guy to death with a shovel. Shit. With a shovel? It's right here, front page news. You could tell he was a no-good crazy by the way he looked at you. Right. Got to be crazy to waste someone with a shovel like that. Damn. What do you want? - I'm looking for Ivo. - Why do you want Ivo? Isn't Ivo here? I'll take care of this. - You OK? - Yeah. - All sorted? - Yeah, don't worry.

 But whatever you hit sure smashed up the car. - A roebuck. - Ah, right, a roebuck. - It must have been in a bad way. - It took the full impact. I changed the bumper and the grille. Luckily I had the parts. Cool, man. Thanks a lot. Here. Don't let my mum find out. She'll kill me. Don't worry. It's OK. This is for helping me out. Thanks. Did you hit him? Yeah. With the butt? Yeah. With the butt. He shouted. There was blood everywhere. I hit... hit... I'm sorry. Etcetera, etcetera. He carries on for 20 minutes. He made sure he wasted the guy, no mistake. And since the weapon was in his trailer, Lequais' goose is cooked. I have to say your hunch was right. But... do we have a motive? Lequais doesn't need a motive. He's nuts. That's his motive. He bears the world a grudge over his daughter. The black guy got too close to his caravan so he eliminated him like a piece of dirt. When he realised what he'd done, he panicked. He dumped the body in the river. End of story. - Was his gun definitely fired? - We're waiting on ballistics. How long? I don't know. That's Marjorie's job now. Paperwork, basically. Anyway, I want you on another case. Willems filed a new complaint this morning. He found another dead cow in his field. It's the second this month. He thinks it was poisoned. - So? - That's all. You two go and see him. He's paranoid. Show him that the police care. That's what we do here, local policing. It must be weird to be back. It must have changed a lot in 20 years. No. Not much. Surroundings change but people don't. People stay the same. It's scary how they don't change. - Turn here. - Aren't we going to see Willems' cows? We're taking a detour. Jean-François Lequais... You never believed he was guilty? - No. - Why not? It was the kind of thing he would have done, looking at his history. No. If it's all so obvious it means something's wrong. Hi. Stay there, no need to get up. We just came to see our client. - Everything OK? - Yes, everything's fine. Nothing to report? He hasn't moved. He's been like that since yesterday. Want to take a break? You got some change? Go and get a coffee. We'll keep an eye on him. I'll be right back. - What are you doing? - Taking some swabs. - Nothing. - Are we allowed to do that? Nothing here either. If he'd fired the gun, he'd have residue on his hands. - Maybe he washed his hands. - Did you wash yours? Yes. Soap won't shift gunshot residue. The microparticles stick around. It takes three weeks for them to go. - What if he wore gloves? - It's possible. But this is a guy who didn't even wear socks. - What are you doing? - Nothing. We're leaving. See you, buddy. Did you know him well? - Who? - The guy who died. I saw him at parties, football matches. He was my brother's mate. He came here a few times. Shit. A guy my brother knows grows it in Maastricht. - Will he smoke it all? - No, he deals. - He makes a packet. - Does he know you smoke? He has no idea. Anyway, he's at football today. Do you like my brother? Sure, he's cute. Me, I couldn't say. Just as well, he's your brother. When it comes to sex my brother's self-sufficient, if you know what I mean. I hear him jerking off all the time, it's gross. - Do you have any brothers? - No. - Any sisters? - No. And your mum, where's she? Shit, it's my brother. Take the joint. Quick, go. Get a move on. Stop it, Kevin. Your mum's upstairs. Quick. Kevin? Kevin? Kevin, are you there? - Kevin? - Yes, I'm in the laundry room. You took the car again. No. You don't have a driving licence. - I didn't take it. - Where are the keys? They're by the door, on the hook. I never touched your car. Listen, it's a difficult time for me right now. I know. I need you and your sister to help me. And not to do anything stupid. If my kids break the rules how will people respect me? Can I count on you? Yes. I have to go now. I'm late. - Wish me good luck. - Good luck. OK. And you need to pass your driving test. NO TO THE HEIDERFELD DAM - Did you call the vet? - He can't bring it back to life. He could say how it died. It was poisoned. - Why do you say that? - It's a heifer. It didn't die of old age. The vet said the other one was poisoned. - Any idea who did it? - Yes. - The Malausas. - Why do you think that? They wouldn't think twice about doing something like that. The other night they were firing a hunting rifle in their garden. - Did you hear gunshots? - I certainly did. Which night was it? Last night. No, wait... It was Friday. The 14th. How many shots? I couldn't say. Two or three. They woke me up. - It's alarming. - I can imagine. Do the Malausas live far away? No. Over there, about a kilometre from here. Robert Malausa? Could we have a word with you? About what? I'm Inspector Drummer and this is Inspector Peeters. Can we ask you some questions? I'm coming. Peeters? Any relation to the writer? I'm his son. I didn't know he had a son. You look like him. What can I do for you, Inspector? Your neighbour found one of his cows dead this morning. - I see. - It's the second this month. - Maybe you saw something suspicious. - Not that I can think of. Bunny, have you seen anything suspicious at Willems' place? - Do you have any firearms here? - We're hunters. We shoot wild boar and deer but we don't shoot cows. Do you hunt at night? Gunshots were heard on your farm last Friday. Is that what Willems told you? No, but he did say you were interested in a plot of his land. Listen, Inspector, poor Willems is completely paranoid. We don't give a damn about his plot. We let off fireworks last weekend. It was carnival and we were having a little party. We lit some rockets. If Willems had looked out he'd have seen the lights. - Have you heard about Driss Assani? - Yes. Nasty business. Dying like that so far away from home. - It's terrible. - Did you know him? Not personally. The Indian killed him, right? Probably, yes. - Do they know why he did it? - No. Still, it was only a matter of time. What happened to his daughter drove him mad. Marie, there you are. - Did you see Mr Philipart's widow? - Yes. - She gave me this to give to you. - Burned to death. Awful. Fire has always been my worst fear. The smoke is deadlier than the flames. - The victims die from suffocation. - Philipart was fortunate to be asleep. They said that to spare his widow. It's horrible. Anyway... It's sad to say this, but sometimes one person's misfortune is a stroke of luck for someone else. There. - How many more? Eight, right? - Right. Soon to be seven, I think. I ran into Patrick Blondiau. If he's compensated he'll sign. That's good. The one I worry about is Willems. He seems very attached to his land. He wouldn't budge even if the compensation figure was doubled. If we convince the others he'll sign. - I'm not sure about that. - Trust me. He'll have no choice. - Shit, this weed is strong. - It's straight from Maastricht. Weed aside, what do you guys do here? - Don't you get bored? - No, it's OK. How's the nightlife? Any clubs here? No clubs you'd really want to go to. Why not? You don't want to know. Sometimes we go to Liège but mostly we organise house parties. One guy puts on big parties. In a huge house. His parents are diplomats, always away. He's a bit weird but he likes to party. He's one of the idle rich and we all freeload. That's cool. So when's the next party? - Tomorrow. - Can I come along too? Yeah, you can come, but... I'll have to ask him. He's a bit paranoid. He's been in trouble with the law. There are drugs at his place so he's wary of new faces. What kind of trouble? He's been inside. Great. Don't worry, he's a cool guy. Shit. Shit. Where is the fucking thing? Shit, shit, shit. Fuck. Is it done? Did you find it? - It's done. - Did you fish it out? Yes, I fished it out. You're lying, Robert. Did you fish it out? I told you to bury it. Bury it. Since when did the word "bury" mean "lake", you idiot? Do you know what will happen if the gun's found? Come here. What you did was serious, you know. Now you're going to do exactly what I told you to do, OK? OK. Good. Give me a kiss, little piggy. Stick your tongue in. You OK? Yeah. Do you know the Malausas? - The chicken farmers? - Yes. No, not really. Why? I saw them earlier. They seem strange. I see them at the Monday market. She's very polite. Always says good morning. What about her husband? - Her husband? - Isn't the fat guy her husband? No, he's her brother. - They live together? - Yes. I know. People talk about it in the village. - Are they linked to Driss's death? - I don't know. - I'm boring you with my questions. - No, not at all. Anyway, it's your turn now. What brings you back to Heiderfeld? My wife died. Leukaemia. It'll be a year in April. Camille and I needed a change. I understand. I wanted a break and... I wanted to see some trees. You came to the right place to see trees. What about you? Why did you stay? For the trees. No, seriously. You wanted to leave. Why did you stay? It's harder for a girl to leave. A girl needs a boy to carry her off. You left without me and... I waited for another Prince Charming but he never came. OK... brush, roller, sealant, baseboard. Wait here, I'll go and get the sealant. - Hello. - Hello. I'm painting my house and I'm looking for a particular colour. - Do you know the code? - No. What colour is it? I've got a sample. It's hard to tell from this, it's not very clear. It's for outside, for a big iron door. Is it anti-rust paint you want? That's right, for a metal surface. OK. You'll have to order it, I'm afraid. I've got none left in stock. A customer in Heiderfeld took it all for his barn two weeks ago. It's crashed again. Shit. I don't believe it. Wait, leave it to me. I'll take care of it, leave it to me. Did you visit the Malausas today? Yes. Willems thinks they killed his cows. Those two hate each other. Their quarrel goes way back. Stay out of it, you'll only fan the flames. - Willems is a bit uptight. - You have to see it his way. His cows are the only family he has. A dead cow was also found at Dussart's place this week. - A healthy heifer. - There you are, see? It could be an epidemic, a virus, mad cow disease. Nothing to do with the Malausas. They lied to us about Driss Assani. You spoke to them about Driss Assani? Yes. They say they didn't know him but I'm sure he painted their barn. Why did you talk to them about Driss? - Was it Willems' idea? - No. But they looked worried when I mentioned Driss. It's a step too far. They probably employed the guy illegally to paint their barn. The Malausas don't have a great reputation in the village. They stick out a bit here but they're not bad people. Anyway, we got the ballistics report. There's no doubt that Lequais' gun was fired. - But Lequais didn't fire it. - What? We saw him in hospital today. I took some swabs. There was no gunshot residue. - You swabbed him? - So we'd know if it was him. Listen, Peeters. When you first came here, I kept quiet. We all deserve a second chance. But there are rules and orders. I don't want an Operation Berger here. Understood? Excuse me a couple of minutes. What exactly are you? I'm sorry? What is your profession? Psychologist? Criminologist? Criminal psychologist? Consultant psychiatrist. I trained in psychiatry and criminology. Are you a doctor? Yes. Why did they choose you? What do you mean? I mean, why choose a doctor? Because of your blanks, your memory loss. They want to fathom your mind. Good luck. I've been trying for 30 years. - Chief. - Finish what you're doing. You know, Peeters is a good guy. And a good cop. But he needs watching. The guy has a past... It's not straightforward. He mustn't ever be left alone. If you see anything, tell me. OK. - You're not eating? - I'm not hungry. Your eyes look puffy. - Have you chosen your school options? - Not yet. - The options are important, Camille. - I know. It's a small school, not like in Brussels. You don't say. So what are you waiting for? You'll end up with no choice. What are you on about? Are you on my case or what? - Hello. - Hello. - You must be Camille. - Yes. I'm Inès, I'm a friend of your dad. This is Jeoffrey. Hello. Dad. - Hi. - Hi. You asked me about the Malausas. I mentioned it to Jeoffrey. He worked for them last summer. - Hello, Jeoffrey. - Hello. Jeoffrey gives me a hand with the horse. Show him what the Malausas did to you. Thanks. No point pushing yourself, Kevin. You need stamina training. What are you doing? Come here and listen to me. You OK? - Did you sort the car out? - It's done. - I don't want people to start talking. - Don't worry. - Things can get around. - He doesn't know. Nobody knows. Here. You'll get the rest later. Is your mum OK? She's OK. Want to come and eat at mine this evening? - This evening's tricky. - Come over later, then. We'll crack open a bottle. It'll be cool, I don't have the kid. - You can sleep over if you like. - This evening's difficult. I have to go. Bye. Afi, how are things? Yeah... Yeah... listen, I'm sorry, I haven't sent the money, but... We won the match on Saturday but the coach says there's no money. It's a bit of a mess, but... But I've had an idea, I'm going to try something. I'll come up with something, with a solution. I'm going to try and find a way to send the money. If not tomorrow, then next week for sure. I'll send a big sum if necessary. We need... We need... I'm here for you, brother, really. Say hello to Mum. Big hug. The main thing for you is the banks, here, then the island, and the bottom of the fields near the willows. 2,500 square metres in total. I see, that much. The region will pay three euros per square metre. - Three euros. - Per square metre, yes. That's 120 Belgian francs. 12,000 per 100 square metres. It's a good price for La Gaume. Grassland usually fetches about 10,000. For you we're getting 7,500 euros compensation. 300,000 Belgian francs. It's a tidy sum. Frankly, you won't get as much if you try to sell elsewhere. We don't want to sell. I know, but you have to be realistic. They're going to build this dam. Mr Philipart's widow has signed. It's a very attractive offer, I promise. We're not going to breed cows for another 20 years. Whatever happens, sooner or later we'll have to sell. Think about it in your own time. We'll talk again next week, OK? It's a very attractive offer. You won't find a better one. Marie, it's me. I was at the Wauters'. - So did he sign? - No, not yet. - Damn. I thought he would. - He will. Jean-Jean's proud but he'll sign in the end. - I'll persuade him. - I'm counting on you to do that. Someone's calling. It could be him. I'll call you back. OK. Yes. Yes. - Let's do that, OK. - OK. Hello? Hello? Hello, can you hear me? I've had enough of this game. I'm warning you, I'll call the police. I'll call the police. Do you understand? So, little slut, you're out walking in the woods. It's dangerous parking there. The woods will soon be flooded by your fucking dam. Who are you? You know what became of Little Red Riding Hood? Sébastian? Yes. Food's on the table. Sébastian! I'm coming, Mum. Sébastian. I'm coming. Sébastian. OPERATION BERGER, BLOODY FIASCO, FOUR POLICE OFFICERS KILLED INSPECTOR PEETERS AT CENTRE OF STORM How much sleep do you get, on average? It depends. Rarely more than three or four hours. Since when? For years. Is it linked to anything in particular? Isn't everything linked to something? Does it worry you? Not really. For ages I tried to make myself sleep, but it didn't work. I ended up coming to terms with it. If I can't sleep, I make use of the time. - I love the night now. - What do you do at night? What I don't have time to do during the day. - I run. - You run? Yes. I like to go running at night. The world seems deserted. Uninhabited. My senses seem to come alive. It helps me think. There's something reassuring about the night. The world's asleep but you're awake. You've stolen a march. This is fucking unbelievable. What the fuck's going on here? At least be discreet. I want everyone outside. And what did you do that night? Nothing. You didn't go out? No. I went back to sleep. Translation: Gill Parrott
