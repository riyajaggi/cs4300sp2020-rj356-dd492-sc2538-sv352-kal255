 Hey, Driss, come here. - Hello, Coach. - Stop calling me Coach. Here. I've got a present for you. What's wrong? You don't like the boots? - No, they're very nice, but... - But what? Coach, it's about the bonus. You said you'd give me the money today. Ah, money. Always money. Is that what you want? Yes, Coach. You're like that, are you? Go on, try the boots on.

 No, it's not that, Coach. I really need the money to send to my family. I understand. I understand everything. Yeah... yeah. But I have no money. I can't pay you. You have to win games for that. That's why you need good boots. Come on, try them. Put them on. But, Coach, they're too small. These are 35s. I take 43s. Cut your foot, then. Sorry, Coach? Cut my foot? Yeah. Go on. I said cut it. Go on! Cut your foot. Go on, cut it!

 Go on! That's it! Yes! Cut it! - Daddy? - Yes? I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I'll show you ten images. You say what comes into your head, OK? You think I'm really crazy, right? No. I don't think you're crazy. We do it with everyone. Just answer spontaneously, with an open mind. No pressure. Shall we begin? What does this make you think of? I don't know. Come on. Relax. Fir trees. A forest of firs. Inspector? Vermeiren left his phone here. - He was obviously in a rush. - Don't issue an alert. He may come back for it. We'll wait. You do it. You wait for him here. OK. Being a cop is a crappy job, but it's even worse when you stop. - At least I can smoke here. - Yeah. So, you're interested in football now? - Yeah. - Really? Come on, then, who's your cheat? Ronald Vermeiren. He's still playing football? - He trains the local team. - I thought so. He played in defence for Lierse. Not very good. It took us a while to catch him. - Well, what do you want to know? - Everything. Football accounts for 50% of sporting bets worldwide, 400 billion. All the mafias are involved. At first they'd bet normally. One third each on win, lose or draw. That way, whatever happens, you get back 66%, a good return for dirty money. Then they realised it'd be even better if they knew the result in advance. So as well as washing their loot, they make ten times their stake. - Especially in China. - Why China? Betting on Chinese football is illegal there, so they target Europe. Mainly small, lower-division clubs. - Clubs in financial trouble. - Clubs like Heiderfeld. Normally they corrupt several people - coaches, defenders, goalies, referees. You think they could have corrupted Driss? Vulnerable, uprooted, badly paid - it's the perfect profile. An African player's a classic target. They take him out, they're all matey. Then they offer him money, lots of money. The guy's in no position to refuse. They fix a game, no problem. Then he's stuck. They have him by the balls. OK. I'm trying to imagine Chinese triads in Heiderfeld. No, the Asians don't come here. Well, rarely. They have branches in each country. In Belgium it's the Albanians. They approach the players and keep them hooked. You think they might kill someone? Those guys fought in Kosovo. They're capable of anything. Scrabble. - Sykarxes? - Yes. 7... 14... 22... What's sykarxes? It's an animal, a small mouse. 66... 144. - It doesn't exist. It's not French. - It is French. It doesn't mean anything. It does mean something. It means little mouse. - Markus, is sykarxes French? - You don't hear it very often, but... Pass me the dictionary. We'll check it right away. Syk, syk, syk, syk, syk... Open your mouth. Open it. Can you read? Sykarxes. Can you hear, little mouse? Can you hear me or not? You OK? Zoé? I'm coming in, OK? - Can I come in? - Yes. It took me ages to pee. - So? - I don't know, you have to wait. Oh, fuck, no! Shit! Don't panic, don't panic. Don't worry, it'll be OK. Zoé, it'll be OK. Calm down. There's a centre in Bouillon. Open on... Mondays. Is Bouillon far from here? No. Hey, don't worry. I'll come with you, OK? Zoé, you're not alone. It'll be fine, OK? Shit, it's Micka. Don't answer it. Don't answer it. Hello? Yes, I'm at school. No, a teacher's away. I'm in the canteen with my friends. Yeah. Yeah, I love you too. Come on, we'll keep looking, OK? I thought Brussels PCs were slow. I know. We're just grateful to have electricity. Excuse me. I just had Vermeiren's wife on the phone. Yes? He picked his daughter up from school. He was supposed to bring her home by 1pm but he hasn't arrived. - Maybe he's just late. - That's what I thought. But she panicked when she knew I was the police. She started crying. She was inconsolable. Vermeiren hardly ever sees his daughter. They're fighting for custody and she's afraid he'll do something stupid. Oh, shit! Hello, Mum. I don't know, Mum. No idea. I told you, I don't know. I'm at work now. Yeah, broccoli's fine. Broccoli's great. No, not here. Don't worry, I'll eat when I get home. I'll eat when I get home. I have to go, Mum. I have to go. Love you, Mum. I can't stop thinking about Driss. I think about him all the time. I imagine him at night in the woods. It's so creepy. You know, I think he was in trouble here at the club. At the club? - Bye, Coach. - See you. What do you mean? I don't know. Maybe he saw something he shouldn't have. What are you talking about? There's too much weird stuff. - We need to talk to the cops. - We don't talk to the cops. I'm going to. You are? Don't talk about the club to anyone. Shut your big mouth! - OK? - Yeah, OK. See you tomorrow. You know I can't do anything without a warrant. - What I did for you is illegal. - You got a conscience now? Enough bullshit. Show me what you've got. It's a German number, a prepaid SIM. There's no contract so Deutsche Telekom can't give me a name. That would be too easy. What I can tell you is that almost all the calls went through phone mast A4456. - Where is it? - Wait... So, 4456... Les Epioux. Les Epioux? - The signal reaches that far? - They're more powerful out here. In the Ardennes they have a 10-kilometre range, sometimes 15. That much? Print me a list of everyone who lives there. That's not my job. And this? Is this your job? I'll give you one hour. I don't understand, Rudy. - Not one of them lives by the river. - Alain is certain. - All the calls came from there. - It's weird. He must live the other side of the village. Yet he seems completely obsessed by the dam. - He must have a link with the river. - Everyone here has. I know, Rudy, but some more than others. If it was Willems I'd understand. Half of his land will be flooded. - He's got a reason. - Well, obviously it's not him. You have a new enemy. Congratulations. I really don't know who it can be. I have to go. Hey, give me that. Ciao. - Hello. - It's Alain. - Yes? - I think I have something for you. Go on. - The German prepaid number. - Yes? My pal at Deutsche Telekom sent me the file. - You got a name? - Marina Schiller. - Shit. - What? You know her? Yeah. - She died five years ago. - Oh, shit. - Mr Ruben Bergmans. - Yes. You say you spent the evening of March 14th with Ronald Vermeiren. - You didn't go to the carnival? - No. - Not at all? - No. I see. You spent the whole evening together? - Yes, that's... - Pardon? Ye... Yes. That's right. What's right? We spent the evening at Vermeiren's place. What did you eat? What did you eat at Mr Vermeiren's? - You don't remember. - No. We're the police, Mr Bergmans. You're here as part of a murder investigation. This is serious, OK? So I'll ask you one last time. - Did you spend... - No. - No? - No. No. - You didn't spend the evening there? - No. - No. - No. So why did you say you did? Mr Vermeiren asked me to. Mr Vermeiren? - Mr Vermeiren asked him to. - Yeah. It's not good to lie, sir. We're the police. False testimony is serious. Hello, Lucien. Hello, Rudy. I knew I'd find you here. - I come every morning. - Yes, I know. How long's it been now? In May it will be five years. The dam water will rise here. What will you do when it's flooded and you can't come? - What do you want, Rudy? - You have to stop calling Fischer. I know it's you. I know why you're doing it and I understand. It's hard, but you can't harass people like that. I won't do or say anything, but you have to stop calling, OK? OK. Your wife liked you, you know? That's what's important. Let her go now. Hey, tiger! Not answering my texts? - I've got network problems. - Oh, yeah? - What do you want? - You know what I want. A photo of the corpse. I don't have access to my father's records. You're lying. - I don't even know if there are any. - Ever seen a TV show? Autopsy, crime scene... He must have a thousand photos. I can't do it, sorry. That's stupid. That's really stupid. - Want me to put this on Facebook? - I don't have access. I can't do anything. You're a beast, tiger. I'm sure you'll manage. OK? Lisbeth. Are you OK? Where were you? We said one o'clock. - I was mad with worry. - I lost track of time. I kept trying to call you. Pick up when I call! I didn't have my phone. I left it at home. Ronald... the police called. They're looking for you. - What have you done? - Nothing. I didn't do anything, I swear. You know what? Get lost. Get lost. BOGUS DELIVERY MAN? ALBANIAN Peeters. Can I show you something? I analysed Driss's phone bills. One number comes up all the time. - 38 times in total. - Yeah? It's Inès Buisson. I know you're neighbours... Thanks, but she was giving him lessons. Inès helped him when he came here. It's no surprise that he called her. Sure, but what bothers me is the frequency. So here... So, October, November, December... an average of 12 calls per month. And then January, nothing, February, March, nothing... right up to his death. I know it means nothing, but you two get along so I thought it best to warn you. You were right. Hello, I'd like to reserve a table for two for tonight. Peeters. At eight o'clock. Thank you. - Would you like a drink? - I'll have a beer. Do you have Orval? Yes. But we also have Duvel, Maredsous, Grimbergen, Rochefort, Karmeliet Double, Westmalle Triple, Westmalle Double, Blue Chimay... I'll have Orval. Very good. Excuse me. Have you ever seen this person? No. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. No, I was miles away. I made your sandwich. Spicy tuna, right? - Isn't that what you asked for? - I didn't ask for anything. Inspector Peeters told me you wanted spicy tuna. - Don't you like spicy tuna? - Spicy tuna's great. - It's great, thank you. - I made you some soup too. - Do you like courgettes? - Yeah. Good, they're from my garden. And I made a flask of coffee too. Thank you. I'll stay with you for a while. OK. Don't you get bored here alone? No, I'm used to being alone. Hi. You all right? - This is a step up. - What do you mean? It's a bit more stylish than the Lunch Garden. I'm sorry, I didn't think it would be so... so empty. I'm kidding. I'm really glad you called. I'm a bit embarrassed about yesterday. - But I came to you. - I know. But I'd had a few drinks too, and... I didn't think it'd end up like that. - It was rather nice. - Really? Yes. You didn't find me weird? Weird? No. Why? I don't know, it was weird to make love with you. I mean nice weird, but you're... - I'm... - You're so much more... I don't know, you have hair everywhere, you're more solid. - I'm not 18 any more. - Yes, I know. Listen, forget it. I can't say what I mean anyway. You really suspected everyone in the village. It must be exhausting to suspect everyone like that. Always on your guard. Can we stop now? I'm tired. Of course. See you tomorrow. You want to say something? No... No, nothing. I can see that you do. Tell me. I was wondering if you were pregnant. You don't have to answer me. Yes, I'm pregnant. Four months. A little girl. I made her pregnant. - Sorry? - Inès. I made her pregnant. When? When we were kids in Heiderfeld. We were too young. We decided not to keep the baby. After that, I left. We didn't see each other for 20 years. Stop, that's enough. Can I ask you a question about Driss? Sure. What do you want to know? Were you close? Relatively, yes. Did you call each other often? Yes, every now and then to arrange appointments. And you stayed on good terms till the end? On very good terms, yes. Why do you ask? Because in January the calls stopped. What... I saw Driss's phone bills. Last autumn you called each other five or six times a week. Then from January there wasn't a single phone call. Why? What is this? Are you investigating me? No, but I saw your number on Driss's bills. - I don't believe it. - Inès... - Is that why you invited me here? - Inès, I'm on your side. I'm doing this for him. I'm just trying to understand. I invested a lot in the relationship. We met two or three times a week, sometimes every day. We talked a lot about him, about Togo, about his family. I think Driss fell slightly in love with me. One day he tried to kiss me. I tried to clarify things but he didn't understand, or didn't want to, I don't know. But he became hard, almost aggressive, so I decided to cut all ties with him. I was really very fond of him. It just wasn't love. Lychee ice cream? Thank you. - Hello? - We got Vermeiren, he's in custody. I have to go. It's important. It's work. I'm sorry. Forgive me. - What's he saying? - Nothing, he's drunk. Come on. - Hold him, René. - Ja! He's completely drunk. What's wrong? Where were you on Friday 14th? - At home. - No, you weren't at home. Where were you? I was at home with my pal Ruben. We talked to your friend Ruben. He remembers it differently from you. So... where were you? Hey! Where were you? The handwriting test, why didn't you come? I couldn't. I was with my daughter. There was blood in your bathroom. I fell. Cut the crap. It's true, I fell. Look, we know about the match-fixing. We know about the Chinese, about Driss. We know everything. So tell us where you were on Friday 14th. At home. You'll spend the night here, Ronald. I was at home. I swear it's true. I didn't kill Driss. You know what we're going to do? I'm going to bed. You're going to think. I'll come back tomorrow and you can tell me a better story. Good night. - I want my phone call. - René? I want my phone call! Yes? Markus, listen. I don't know if I can make the match tomorrow. - We have to cancel, Ronald. - No. We have to play. Whatever happens, we have to play. OK. We'll play. - OK, that's enough. - But... Hello? - Hi. - Hi. - All right? - Yes. - What are you watching? - Just rubbish. It's amazing. - They put rubbish on TV now? - Shut up. Come on, budge up. - Been working all this time? - Yes. Well, more or less. - And you? How was school? - Fine. What's the level like? They're not very good, especially in Flemish. They're useless. I speak it better than the teacher. I'm going to bed. - You'd better go too. - I'll just watch another five minutes. - It'd be a shame to miss the end. - Go to bed! Hey, family, what do you say? What do you say? What does the family say? I've got money, I've got money! Afi, what did I say? Afi? I've got money. I found a new job. With this, on Thursday you go to Western Union. I'll send it to you on Thursday, OK? I'll send it. Next week, if I do the same thing again, I'll send more, twice as much, OK? Yeah! Afi, what did I say? What did I say? I send you a big kiss. Afi, kiss Mum for me, OK? Hey! Is anyone there? I want to talk to Inspector Peeters! Guys... I'd like you to wear these today in memory of Driss. Right arm. We're playing this match for him. It's not easy, I know, and thank you, but we can't lose this game. We have to play, so give it everything. Come on, let's go. There was match-fixing at Heiderfeld. I think Driss was involved. It started early in the season, around October. One Sunday morning, two Chinese men came to the match. They were with a third man, an Albanian. He said he was a sports agent. He told Markus that the Chinese men owned a club in Kazakhstan. Is that true? I doubt it. They took pictures, but from a distance. They didn't talk to anybody. Those guys weren't there to buy. They were there to cheat? I think so. Two weeks later I saw the Albanian hanging around the club. I saw him talking to Driss in the car park. I tried to talk to Driss, to warn him. I know these people, I know their methods. They're the mafia. They're dangerous. After that, Driss wasn't the same player. Come on, guys, for Driss! OK. Let's say you weren't involved. Where were you that night? I was sitting in the Musketeer. It's a bar. I got into a fight and my leg was injured. - That's all? - Yes. Why didn't you say so? Because I was drunk. I've been sober for 18 months. That was the condition for seeing my daughter. Please don't say anything. If the judge knows that I was drinking, I'll never see Lisbeth again. And I need to see my daughter, she's all I have left. And what does this fake agent look like? A little bit lower. Yes... Wait. The chin's smaller. And much darker eyebrows. - What did you do? - What? Kevin, I saw you. Honestly, I saw you. - Saw me what? - You let go of the ball three times. We shouldn't have conceded that goal. Then why didn't you stop it? Are you with them? - With who? - Shit... Ivo, you're talking crap! They killed Driss, Kevin. They killed him. - They'll kill you too. You have to stop. - Get off me. Smaller chin. - Like that? - Yeah. And darker, black... Yeah, that's it. Translation: Gill Parrott
