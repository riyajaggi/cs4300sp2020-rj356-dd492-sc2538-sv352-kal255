 I want to dance with my wife. Previously on "Red Widow"... No one steals from Schiller. (Gunshot) (Grunts) Schiller was ripped off two nights ago. A couple of his guys were killed. What did you do to us?! If you don't get out, I will take the kids and I will leave. I want to import a consignment for me. This is your debt.

 (Gunshot) (Grunts) (Screams) You said one consignment and then it was over. Everything that could have gone wrong did. I fixed it. I fixed it all. And then you killed my port contact. People... (Exhales) Who can fix things... they're a great deal harder to find. I'm working for him now. It won't end. Me and the kids... we have to disappear. (Kat) What would happen if you just stayed? (Marta) Schiller will kill me the moment I'm not useful to him.

 I have to get out of here before he calls me with my next job. (Knocking on door) (Siren wailing in distance) He's worth it. The fake I.D he made me in high school... even dad said it was flawless. I don't remember that. Eh, I think you were off having babies or something. (Sighs) Come on. Hey. Uh, Wallace, um, I'm katerina... Katerina Petrov, born 1980, S.F. General. - Whoa, good memory. - Photographic. What do you want? Four Canadian passports. Oh, you a Petrov, too? - Nah, forget it. - Wait. Uh, $20,000. Look, there's not enough money in the world... $50,000. All in. There are the old passports. - Names? - They're on the passports. No, no, no, no. I think he means your... (Whispers) New names. Keep the first letter of their birth name. Helps if they start to sign their real name. Gives them a second to catch themselves. Uh... (Normal voice) Greg. - Greg? - I l... I like Greg. Okay. Yeah. Uh, Gabriel is Greg. Natalie could be Nadia, and Boris... - Brandon? - Will be Brandon. - And I'll be Mary. - (Scoffs) Mary. (Chuckles) Could you be more generic? Just, uh, yeah, c-come back in two days. I don't have two days. Another 10 grand buys you tomorrow. Deal. So, tomorrow night. (Sighs) What are you gonna tell the kids? At sea. We'll take the "Corina" to Canada and then we'll get a flight... somewhere. Somewhere? I can't tell you, Kat. No one can know... not dad, not mom. Not Irwin. No. No! He'll try to be useful and do something rash, so especially not Irwin. Not Irwin. (Gate alarm ringing) (Marta laughs) (Inhales deeply) Ohh... Oh! I'm okay now . (Chuckles) (Laughs) Oh! I wasn't sure I'd have a chance to do this. Ah, you and me both. Well, the guest room is set up. Yeah, I'm not gonna stay long. As soon as I get the business back up on its feet, then... Good. The boats are in great shape. We've been doing some advertising. No... (Laughs) Not the charter business. I mean... Our other business. Irwin, you said that running a charter business was gonna be good. Yeah. Anything sounds good from a prison cell. It might not be a prison cell next time. You know what happened to Evan. Sweetie, listen, I'm broke. Mike's broke. We need to move some pot. Actually, I need to use your phone. No. No! Marta, don't worry about me. You have enough on your plate having to work for Schiller. So much for just one consignment, huh? Apparently... I'm "of value" to him. Which is good, because I've seen what he does to people who aren't. Do you know where I fit on that scale? Well, hopefully nowhere. If you're lucky, you will stay off his radar. I feel like crap about this. It's not your fault. Evan's the one that decided to steal from Schiller in the first place. (Exhales) It's not gonna last forever. Here. (Dialing) Hey, Mike... Yes, we've got buyers, but we've got nothing to sell. (Keys jangling) Orson won't give us our supply back. I called him, like, four times. Yeah. No. Orson says Evan was the brains of the operation. Guess which body part that makes us, huh? (Chuckles) Anyhow, maybe, you know, it's time to find another grower. No way. No. Orson grows the best product in Humboldt county. The best, period. We're working with him. You know, you can't build a business on bad bud. Build? (Chuckles) I thought you'd give up on expanding the operation. (Laughs) You kidding? No, I got big plans, bro. Well, then you gotta change Orson's mind, man. I need the money. Okay. (Breathing heavily) (Head thuds) Ah, man! Wait! That moment right there... that was the moment I ran out of patience. Pablo, I swear... I am good for it. Ohh! See, I don't care if you snort and gamble my money away... Until you don't pay me back. Then I care. (Panting) I got income... Coming. (Panting continues) I'm working with Schiller. If that's true, I want my money now before you wind up dead. I will get it. How much you spend on this? (Exhales) Come on, man, that's my wife's. A lot. It's... It's worth a lot. Welcome home. Hey, thanks for the prison vacay. I'm reformed now, so you can... go. Actually, I was hoping to talk to your sister. Oh, screw you. Irwin, I'm fine. Can you go inside? (Sighs) I thought you should see these. Washed up on Alameda beach last night. Bob Lagrosse, supervisor at the port of Oakland. (Gunshot) (Marta) No! He was killed last week, around the time you were seen at the port. Seen... by who? I'm here to tell you that the bureau's building a case against you. Based on what, being seen at a port? Based on me telling you you're in over your head with Schiller. There's a man dead. What, are you gonna be next? You're looking at the same options Evan had. He chose Witness Protection because he knew we were the only way out. And that worked out so well for him. I never had a chance to prove it. But I'll prove it to you. I'll get you away from Schiller. I don't need your help. You still think you can flip her? She's no longer denying she knows Schiller. Progress. (Chuckles) (Sighs) (Pop music playing faintly) Mm. Guess who! (Laughs) (Irwin and Natalie laugh) A... pirate, or my Uncle Irwin? (Laughs) (Laughs) Hi. Oh, we missed you! I missed you more, trust me. Mm! Hey. Can you go upstairs and get the boys? Yes. Is that moy zalatoy malchik? (Laughs) Mamulya! (Laughs) Ohh! Mm! Mwah! You're skin and bones! Those animals, they tried to starve you, huh? No, I gained weight, mom. Look at me. Aw! What are you doing cooking, mama? There's a chicken in the fridge. He needs his maht's cooking, huh? Come. (Phone rings) It's Orson, my grower. Hopefully. (Sighs) Hey, buddy. Papa, what are you doing here? (Irwin speaking indistinctly) I heard they let my idiot son out. Oh. I came to protect my children. Oh, don't be an ass. Just admit you wanted to see him. Well, I didn't come to see you. (Irwin speaking indistinctly) You know wh... okay. Wait, wait, wait. L... no, no, don't hang up on me. Damn it. Orson gave our supply to another exporter. He's not gonna budge. Good. Okay, so you're gonna go legit. No, Marta... look who's here. Boris! (Chuckles) Look! Uncle Irwin! Holy crap, buddy! You're huge! (Laughs) Hey, Gabriel. What, you working out? (Speaks indistinctly) Um, excuse me? Is it okay if I use the bathroom? You left her in the car? I didn't know your mother is cooking. Oh, papa! It's okay. Come on, I'll show you the bathroom. Right here... Who paid your bail? (Elena) His mother... gladly. You seem okay. Are you raped? No, pop. No one got near me. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. The best pot in the world comes from Humboldt County, especially from our grower, Orson. Now he just needs his cage rattled. You get me some muscle, and I'll get our supply back. Now you always wanted a piece of our operation, but Evan didn't want you involved. Now here's your chance. Marijuana was a lucrative business for Evan. This view costs money. Yeah, and Evan kept it small, but it's got huge potential. I'm sorry. It is not worth the risk. What risk? You, son. You are the risk. (Pop music continues) Jackass. (Clears throat) I never would have left you in a car. I need you to be nicer to Irwin. (Scoffs) The kind of nice he wants will only get him killed. Yeah. He's your son. You're gonna want him in your life when you get older. I have you. That's enough. (Pats knee) (Exhales) (Birds chirping) (Sighs) All the web sites say to pack as little as possible when you disappear. (Sighs) Uh, what do you pack when you're starting an entirely new life? One pair of really comfortable underwear? (Both laugh) (Phone rings) No caller I.D. (Ringing continues) Oh, no, no. We're leaving tonight. Well, maybe he's not calling about another job. (Ringing stops) (Sighs) This is Marta. (Man) Mr. Schiller would like to see you. Now. (Sighs) (Men speaking indistinctly) No, that was... (Speaks indistinctly) Right. Why is he here? He came of his own accord. Yeah, I wanted to see how I could be of... value. It takes a certain type of man to own his mistakes. Especially when he understands the consequences. Perhaps you have some of your father's steel after all. (Chuckles) I don't understand. Irwin made me a proposition. I asked Mr. Schiller to distribute some of our Humboldt product. (Drink pouring, glasses clink) Well, I told him about the situation. But with Mr. Schiller involved, Orson will fall in line. (Clicks tongue) And, um, if he doesn't? I can be very persuasive. (Schiller laughs) This, um, Orson fellow's business is, uh, small but prestigious, with growth potential... if you can deliver. Oh, I'll deliver. Think about it. I'll give you my word, and you'll give me yours. We'll live and die by our word. Irwin. Absolutely. Great. Mrs. Walraven will supervise you. Supervise me? Yeah, consider it an audition. No. Perhaps you have doubts about Irwin's capability? I could always find another way for him to pay his debt. He's more capable than I ever was. I'm in. You definitely have your father's steel. (Laughs) Sync and correction by GeirDM www.addic7ed.com do you have any idea what you've just done? Schiller was gonna come after me eventually, so I went to him... to pay him back on my terms. And... the upside of risk is opportunity. Oh, God. Always hustling. Why did you even tell her? She's a yoga instructor! Do you realize that we can't fail? We either get Orson on board, or we die. Orson's crazy, but he does know what Schiller's name means. Then he's one up on you. Yeah, right! Judge me while you and hubby live on daddy's dime, not that hubby even knows. Oh, can you just stop? You know, Irwin... please. Please! Right. I'm sorry. I'm not. Shut up! Really! Do you even know where Orson is? Stinson beach. Camps there whenever he's in town. Doesn't like the indoors. Some Vietnam post-traumatic stress syndrome. All right. Well, we're going. We need to see him now. Well, I'm gonna go get drunk and laid. Oh... Don't you dare take this lightly! Relax. You don't approach Orson at night. (Sighs) Marta, you're leaving tonight. Okay? You're gonna get those passports, and you are leaving tonight. No. I... (Phone rings) Schiller's gonna stay on top of this until it's done. I'll deal with Orson in the morning, and we'll leave tomorrow night. Uh, mom? Aunt Dina's on the phone. She sounds kinda freaked out. I get home from my trip. Mike is gone. My favorite painting is missing. I can't reach him. Okay. All right. Let's... let's go take a look at his credit cards. Maybe we can track where he's been. (Door opens) What the hell happened here? A break-in? Where have you been? Are you all right? I'm fine, yeah. You okay? Oh, babe, they took your painting. (Sighs) We'll get you another one. (Kiss) (Woman sighs) (Irwin) You sure you have to go? Yeah, I have to be at the office... Early. (Woman panting) (Whispers) How early? Not that early. (Weights clanging) (lrwin) Come on, Gabe. (Gabriel grunts) Push it up, push it up. Yeah! Nice, g-man. (Grunts) Nice! Good one. (Boris) What, that dot? Dot? Um, that one's filled in with black. Hey. What are you guys working on? Can we show her? It's not done, but... Yeah. Okay. (Gasps) Wow. That is a great-looking shoe, Boris. The man on the motorcycle wore it. The man who killed dad. Boris has been remembering, mom. Well, that's... great, baby. We need more markers. Okay. Maybe now we can find him. Ready to hit the beach? (Birds squawking) (Irwin) Guy in the kayak's Orson. Maybe I should just talk to him. No, I got this. Irwin, this has to work. Or Schiller will kill us? We should get t-shirts made. (Sighs) How many ways I gotta say it, Petrov? (Clattering) No Evan, no product. Well, I got Evan's widow standing in for him. Well, I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am, but I've had to move on. Well, the coxon burnouts can't guarantee the security we have. They know what they're doing. I'm sure they're fine, but they can't distribute like Schiller can. Schiller? So you're working with Schiller now? Evan never would have danced with a devil like that. Yeah, that's 'cause Evan played it too safe. Obviously not safe enough. With Schiller, we can expand. This conversation is finished. No, Orson, you're not getting it. We're with Schiller. This isn't a negotiation. It's a done deal. Well, I don't take orders from anybody. Oh, you will, once he sends his guys. Which he won't, because we... you send him on. You tell me he can Hunt me up in Humboldt. That is, if he can make it past my tripwires. Now get the hell out of here. (Birds squawking) Orson was never just gonna hand it back to us. Yeah. Well, maybe if you didn't threaten him. Let's just go to plan "b." We'll get some of Schiller's guns and guys and... no! No guns, no more dead bodies. Don't overcomplicate this. Irwin, this is not your call. Are you pulling rank? Yeah. You put me in this position, so I'm pulling rank. Okay, boss lady. What's your plan? I'm gonna wait for Orson to calm down, then I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow... alone. Marta, you don't know this guy. You... (breathing heavily) (Dialing) Mike? I'm gonna need your help. Okay, so we pick up the passports tomorrow. (Exhales) Yeah. So long as Orson gives, ramos doesn't try to arrest me, and Schiller doesn't... No, you're right. It'll work. (Sighs) We're gonna leave tomorrow. Thanks, Kat. I love you, too. (Indistinct conversations, horns honking) They're perfect. Pay me. (Envelope rustles) Don't call me again. (Cell phone rings) Hello? (Mike) Get down to the marina right now. Why? What's going on? Irwin and I are in trouble. (Horn blows in distance) (Man) Rack it back, felicity. I just got a call from that forger Wallace. You had me reprimand him for making katerina's I.D.? Right. The four passports he just made for Marta. "Made"? It is done? I'll get her money back. (Sighs) She's running. The children should be with their family, not living in fear in the middle of nowhere. She lives in fear here. (Felicity giggles) (Man) Very good. (Snaps) (Ball bounces) Let's go, honey. We are going to see Marta and the children. Awesome. I'll buy cuppy-cakes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Did you see me playing? Excellent. Oh, you called her? (Mike) I'm not gonna let this guy die. Oh, my God! One of the coxon brothers? What happened? We were lifting Orson's weed. What? It was part of a plan. Hey, I didn't shoot him. Mike did. It was an accident. Bart spotted us. He started shooting. I fired a warning shot. Rodney's gonna kill you so dead. Rodney ran... like a little girl. Come on, I'm getting him to a hospital! (Grunts) Oh, God! Ohh! Come on! Get out of my way! (Groans) Come on. (Grunting) (Mike) What's ramos doing here? (Grunting) Guess we're stuck. (Bart continues grunting) (Birds calling) That's sour look's gonna get stuck on your face, Newton. You gonna sit on the widow all day? Just making myself available. Are you sure that crime scene photo of Bob Lagrosse pushed the right buttons? Trust me, she's feeling the pressure. (Marta) Ramos is here to see me, so I'll distract him... (Bart grunts) And lead him away. Like that? (Irwin) This is what he does. He corners you. Did it with me, too. We gotta get a doctor here. Gunshot wound. The doctor's gonna call the cops. Not all doctors. No! No fricking way! No... dad knows doctors, Russian doctors, who don't talk to pol... (Dialing, beeps) If we wait an hour, the problem will take care of itself. (Seethes) My God, Irwin. Call Andrei. He's not gonna get past ramos. (Breathing heavily) Wait. Just wait. (Dialing) (Cell phone rings) Ramos. Hi. Um, this is katerina pet... uh, castillo. Uh, Marta Walraven's sister? Well, you said to call if something came up. Um, something came up. What's going on? Not over the phone. Uh... I'll meet you at your office in half an hour. Look, I-I don't know what else to do. See you in 30. Okay. See you then. (Sighs) How bad? No. Stay put. We're on our way. I'm going to leave you here, baby. But... what about Marta and the kids? And these delicioso cuppy-cakes? Get out. (Engine starts) What exactly was your plan? My plan... was to not be somebody's bitch. I was trying to show Orson that the Coxons can't protect his product. By stealing it? By holding it hostage until he works out a deal with us. (Speaks Russian) (Doctor speaks Russian) Sorry to keep you waiting. Uh, you want a-a coffee or... she only drinks green tea. (Clears throat) So what's up? (Sighs) Can I call you Kat? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, sure, um... James. Look, uh, I really shouldn't be here. But I think that maybe you were right. Marta is in way over her head. What makes you say that? Well, why else would you keep hounding her? So I need you to help me help her. How? Stop hounding her. (Laughs) Well, that's, uh... That's the important information you had for me? Yeah, and that's funny to you? It's more surprising. You've got balls, but you suck at subterfuge. You want to tell me why you wanted me away from that marina? (Clears throat and sighs) Kat, if there's a crime in progress, I can charge you with aiding and abetting. How much are you willing to sacrifice for her? (Chuckles) James... You seem to know a lot about my family, my parents. So you can guess what it was like growing up. Marta sacrificed her childhood, her future to take care of me and Irwin. So ask me again how much I would sacrifice for her. (Newton) Ramos, your wife is here. How did you even get in? I still have friends here. Evie... evie, what are you doing here? What did you do with my jewelry box, huh? I looked for it everywhere and I couldn't find it. Let's talk about it at home. (Eva shouts in Spanish) James, she can't be here. Callate! I'm an agent, just like you. You used to be! Vamos, evie, vamos. (Grunts and shouts in Spanish) (Groaning) Glupyy malchik. You put your family at risk, your sister in danger. (Bart groans) Oh, now you're worried about her? (Exhales) At least I'm doing something. I'm trying to help her. Into a prison cell. Or God knows where. While you do nothing 'cause you're too afraid of Schiller. He stole your business and your balls. You little bastard! (Grunts) It was a lot easier when I was 6, wasn't it? Stop it! (Grunts) What is wrong with you?! See what you've done? He's only doing what you taught him to do. I've had it! (Bart grunts) (Breathing heavily) You and the kids should leave. Now. I'll help you. If I leave Schiller with this mess, he'll just Hunt us down wherever we go. Orson and the brother will come for you. Not if I go to them first. Let's hope Mike's here. Mm. He knows where we're going. (Grunting) (Pills rattling) Here. (Clatters) (Groans softly) Take it! Sell it all! Put it up your nose! (Clattering) Enough! I get the point. Oh, hey, don't forget about my boutique. Make sure to snort the rent deposit! (Rattling) Hi. G-guys. The door is open. We're completely broke. (Sighs) The bank calls. Checks are bouncing. I find a stack of unpaid bills. I am taking care of it. By gambling it away, trying to win back what you snorted? You are the reason we are in this hole! This fork! $1,000 for a fork? Why don't you snort that, too?! Guys, guys, can we just take a breather here? (Breathing heavily) Hey. (Sighs) (Exhales and sighs) I'm scared, marly. I know. (Sighs) (Scoffs) No lectures. No lectures, just a request. Leave Dina. Go to hell. I'm not always gonna be there for her. Like you've been there at all lately? She loves you too much to leave, and you're just gonna hurt her. (Exhales) I keep seeing him. Bob. It plays over and over and over in my head. They just shot him down. Like an animal. I can't shake it. (Sighs) (Footsteps) (Exhales) Unusual week I'm having. Another Petrov at my door. I'm asking you to leave my daughter alone. (Inhales sharply) I see, uh, this is difficult for you. But, uh, it's not that simple. She stole nothing from you. But her husband did. You wouldn't exact a price? I do not prey on helpless women. (Laughs) One, yes, you do, all the time, and... and, two... Marta, helpless? If you have an issue with me, you deal with me. You don't use my daughter. My God, the narcissism. My arrangement with Marta has nothing to do with you. You are, um, irrelevant. If it were true, you would have killed her by now. Don't tempt me. There is no reasoning with romani scum. (Clicks tongue) All right, all right. She's free and clear. If... You give me the rest of your territory. Listen. You gutted my business years ago. You killed my men, family. Well, you did a fair bit of that yourself. But that's in the past. Today you can wipe clean your daughter's debt just by retiring. My father says a man must sacrifice everything for his children. Are you that kind of man, Andrei? (Breathing heavily) (Bart grunts) Are you gonna kill me? (Luther) Yeah, that's why we just saved your life. Lie back down. (Marta) Wait a sec. I think this is the road Mike was talking about. We have something for Orson. Is he dead? Nah. We want to talk to him. (Clicks) (Snap) (Bart groaning) (Groaning continues) Yeah, he'll talk. Just to you. Okay. We're leaving. (Groaning continues) Marta. Marta, don't. (Footsteps) What happened to Bart... (Grunts) (Coughing and gasps) (Coughing continues) (Wheezing) I don't care you're a woman. (Coughing continues) You steal from me, you shoot my people... (Coughs) You feel the hurt. I... I didn't steal from you. (Gasps) We wanted to make a point. The coxons can't protect your product. It'll be returned? If you can guarantee... No reprisals. Evan never would have pulled a stunt like this. (Panting) Yeah. Well, you're not negotiating with Evan. (Laughs) So we're negotiating, are we? Orson, man, you can't be ser... take Bart inside now. (Panting) (Grunting) I gave Evan a bigger share than I should have. And I didn't renegotiate with him because I trusted him. I do not... Extend that to his widow. I'd just as soon put a bullet in you. Oh, yeah? (Panting continues) Well, we're starting on the same page. Guess we are negotiating. (Cartoon music playing on TV) All right, now here's the plan. We gotta get to town... (Cartoon continues indistinctly) You are a good boy. You are the man of the house now. Take care of them. I will, dedushka. (Pats shoulder) Whwhat? (Sighs) Yeah. I'm okay. Listen, Marta. I went to Schiller. I tried to convince him to leave you alone. Oh, I couldn't. So, Natalie's into penman boots, huh? Do you... do you recognize this? It's a pretty common brand. No, no. This is from Boris' memory. He's remembering details of Evan's killer. You want me to look into it? Hey. I hear we're good with Orson. Means we're good with Schiller. Yep. Your plan worked. Uh, it wasn't part of my plan for you to execute it. Hey... (Sighs) Did he hurt you? God, you know, I'll kill him. You should have taken me with you. You'd have done exactly what I wanted to do, and we'd all be dead. You put me and my children at risk. You made things worse for me, and this is the last time, Irwin. I will never bail you out again. And I understand why you did this. Why you do these things. Control. 'Cause when you have to eat crap, it just comes piling on, until finally it hits you... literally... that you are completely helpless. Like a child. Or an animal. You don't control your life. You can't protect yourself or your children. And I will never feel that again. And my children will never feel that, ever. (Indistinct conversations in distance) (Horn blows in distance) Going for a sail? Not today. You wanted to ask me something? (Exhales) How much do you have on Schiller? A lot. Enough to bury him so he can't touch me or my children? No. Then I'll get you what you need. (Plane engines whirring) We have a deal with Orson. So you'll be receiving product regularly. There were problems. There always are. You'll be making a profit. I need to earn, too. I have children to feed. And you'll always do what's best for them, won't you? Always. (Plane engines whirring) Irwin and Michael Tomlin will need to earn, too. Not Michael Tomlin. I've looked into him. He owes debts. He's unreliable. Unless you are willing to vouch for him. And so we begin. (Chuckles) Sync and correction by GeirDM www.addic7ed.com
