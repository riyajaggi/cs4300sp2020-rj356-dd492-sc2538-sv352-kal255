 It was so powerful. Even at 11 p.m. when you enter the Beit Midrash. Was it good? I would add some black pepper. It could use a kick. I feel bad for my little Israel. Your Israel? I raised him. Don't start. Abot Barkai Productions Talisma Productions Created by Ori Elon and Yehonatan Indursky Dov Glickman Michael Aloni Ayelet Zurer Neta Riskin Shira Hass Casting Hila Yuval

I don't really care about the salads. I want the wedding to be colorful. Beautiful. You have to taste this, Kive. It's just like Mother used to make. It's delicious. Look. Each invitation has a name. This is the Classic. -Elegant. -Elegant. Royal. Royal. -Cute, isn't it? -Yes, very cute. I like the Royal. What about you? Yes, the Royal is very nice. This is Shimon Piontak's invitation! We went to the yeshiva together. -You did? -Yes. He was something else. He had a collection of empty cigarette packs. Shall we take the Royal then? He'd give his life for an empty pack of Russian cigarettes that someone brought from Uman. Well, Gentlemen, we have to make some decisions. Five salads, right? Main course: Shnitzel, kebab and chicken, right? Side dishes: Rice with almonds, baked potatoes and sweet carrots. How many servings are we ordering? I was thinking about 400. What do you think, Kive? Four hundred? Isn't that too much? Rabbi Gottlieb, do you know why food is served at weddings? Why? Because people tend to rain on someone else's event, so the thing is to appease them with a piece of chicken and some potatoes and get their blessing. -That's all fine and good, but... -None of that. We'll take 500 servings. We'll pay for 350, you'll pay for 150. Akiva is my youngest. I want to go all out on his wedding. -Gentlemen, have you come to a decision? -Yes. Let me say this, it's important that you tell the waiters that they not skimp on our guests. If someone wants the schnitzel and the chicken, let him have it. You decide, I... I'm going to the bathroom. -Write this down. -I'm writing, my friend. How many servings? Five hundred and twenty. How are you, Akiva? Fine, thank you. -Are you all right? -Yes. I... I want to tell you a secret. -It's between you and me. -Okay. I have five daughters and three sons, bless them all. A father mustn't say things like this, but my Esti is my favorite. I dote on my princess. -She really is a princess. -Exactly. I've been meaning to say thank you, Akiva. Thank you? For what, Rabbi Gottlieb? I... Yes, thank you. My Esti has been so happy since she met you, and I am happy for her. -You know what I mean? -Yes, I'm happy too, of course. So I want to thank you because when my daughter is happy, I'm happy. Thank you, Rabbi Gottlieb. You can go ahead and call me Father. Thank you. Thank you. Give me a strong handshake. Don't be shy. Change the batteries, it's more expensive than the robot. -It doesn't vacuum well as it is. -You tried the rechargeable ones? -Yes. They're just as bad. -I'm sorry I'm late. It took longer than I thought. I had to get away before Father could ask any questions. Okay, let's get down to business. Akiva, do you want to go first? You're the host, you go first. Well then... The Torah says that when Jacob said to his sons... Hold on, maybe I will go first. -Be my guest. -Okay. We're very happy that Akiva is about to build a home of his own, but we all know it means that Father will be on his own. I don't see the problem. Is he disabled? -An invalid? -No. But no one likes going to bed alone at night. It's no fun at all. -What's so bad about it? -Hang on, she's not done yet. -I thought of two possible solutions. -You always have solutions. One, I thought we should talk to a matchmaker. Maybe Konigsberg. Or maybe a female matchmaker. We could try and persuade him that it's best. It won't work. I asked him outright, "Father, would you like to hear about some matches for yourself?" He didn't answer, he just started laughing. What's the other option? Maybe to convince him to live with someone. -Like Sucher. -Sucher? -Oh, come on... -You want Father to live with him? Or Sucher can move in with Father. -Father likes him a lot. -Likes him? He pities him. Why would he pity him? Do you think Sucher was born a "Mizruchnik" like he is today? Sucher was one of the best students in Hebron Yeshiva. He was? I didn't know that. What happened? He called off a match, left the yeshiva. He enlisted, the poor man. Well, I'm going back to the Yeshiva. Take care. -We haven't decided on a solution. -Because there is no problem. Don't worry. Father will be fine. I know. -Then why do you look worried? -I don't know. The wedding, the arrangements, so much to do. You should be as happy as I am. I am happy, don't worry. My grandfather, may he rest in peace, used to live on this alone. Tea and biscuits. That's all he ate. Those were different times. I have an idea. Instead of all that excessive food at Akiva's wedding, which will be thrown out anyway, we'll just serve tea and biscuits. That's a good idea. Where will they live? At first, they'll rent a place in this area, then maybe, we'll find them an apartment. Tell me if you hear about a key-money apartment, not too big. -Where will you live? -Me? Where do I live now? Will you live on your own? Remind me who you live with? It's not... something I'm happy about. I'll get used to it. I'll take some sleeping pills and I'll be just fine. Live alone, die alone. At least, you can come here to eat. Do you mind me coming here? I like having you eat here. What can we do? Actually... Someone suggested I meet this divorced American. -Is he nice? Did you ask about him? -Yes, he's very nice. And rich too. Then maybe you should meet him. You wouldn't mind? On the contrary, I'm happy for you. Someone left a heater outside the door. They shouldn't have done that. Someone could take it. So what? They'd be warm at night. It's not right. You can't monitor who gave it back, etc... With the help of God Thank you! It's okay, I know who it's from. LOTTERY It's boiling. Akiva, hello. Rabbi Yisaschar, how are you? Well, thank God. What brings you here? Congratulations are in order. I got engaged. I know, I heard. Mazal tov. I apologize, we didn't have an engagement party, just an intimate affair for the family. It wasn't... Truth is, I'm here to make you an offer. I've been thinking... Father... has not been the same since Mother passed away. Come inside. I'll make you a glass of tea. Sit down. So I was thinking... I'm getting married and leaving home. Maybe you could move in with my father. That way neither of you will be alone. Did you discuss this with your father? -Yes. -Did he agree? Well, I didn't really discuss it with him, but the idea came up and he didn't reject it. I'll be honest with you, your father and I never got along. The only thing we had in common was that we both loved your mother, may she rest in peace. I don't think he'll agree to this arrangement. But what if he does? Do you really think he wants to be alone? If he agrees, he can call me and... -I'll consider it. -Okay. Give me a Chance card for 250 for the 2 o'clock lottery. -Sure thing. -Make it quick. Everyone's always in a hurry. You have seven minutes to spare. I have a passenger in my cab. -Thank you. -Good luck. -Don't you feel ill at ease sometimes? -What do you mean? All those people, wasting their family's money on a dream. On the contrary. This place is like a branch of the Western Wall. On the contrary. -They leave notes with you too. -Yes. Can I have a cigarette? Here you go. I think we might have found you an apartment, thank God. Are you listening to me? -What? -Thank you. I just got a call from realtor and I think one and a half rooms is great to start with. What will you do here all alone with four rooms? Do me a favor, you worry about yourself. -I bumped into Sucher today. -You "bumped into" him? What were you doing in Kiryat Yovel? I thought you might suggest that he move in with you. You are brothers-in-law, after all, "Hide not from thine own flesh" and maybe it'll be nice to live with someone. Don't do me any favors. I want to sleep at night, with no yelling. Sucher yells? -You can barely hear him when he talks. -He yells in his sleep. He used to sleep over before you were born. His yelling would wake us up in the middle of the night. -What does he say? -He yells. -Why did he call it off? -Call what off? The match. How would I know? I don't think he even knows. Forget about it, poor man. A person doesn't call off a match for no reason. The girl, Weinstein, she's about to marry off her grandchildren and what became of him? He was so ashamed that he enlisted in the army. Poor man, 60 years old and a bachelor. An unlucky lottery salesman. I can sympathize with him. What does that mean? Maybe rushing into marriage isn't the right thing for me. -Rushing? -I don't even have a job. -How will I support her? -Kive, listen to me. It's always been this way. Everyone has those moments between the engagement and the wedding that he has second thoughts... -But you know what they say? -What do they say? The word "doubt" in gematria is the devil. Something like that... Don't worry. You made a sound choice, you did the right thing and your bride is wonderful. She's the most special of all my daughters-in-law. She is? I guess she is very special. I spoke to her father in the event hall... -Listen, listen. -The funeral of Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Cheshin will leave from Shamgar -funeral home to the cemetery. -Did you hear that? It's providence. You're talking about making a living and suddenly you hear a voice from the road below. I didn't hear what he said. Who's funeral? Rabbi Cheshin. Rabbi Cheshin. He must have suffered another heart attack, now you'll teach his class on a permanent basis. Father, I don't think it's nice to be happy like this. -The poor man. -What about you? Wondrous are the ways of the Lord. You wanted a sign from heaven? You got it. Come on, put something on and we'll go to the funeral. -Bnei Brak? -Get in, Ma'am. -When do you leave? -As soon as the vehicle is full. Sit down, Ma'am. -I'm glad you picked that seat. -Excuse me? I'll have something pretty to look at. Shame on you, talking to a religious woman like that. Sorry. -Bnei Brak? -Yes. Get in. Sixteen shekels, no radio. Hello. "Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who brings forth bread from the earth." -Amen. -Amen. How many times must I tell you that's an "orphaned amen". You should say amen right away, don't wait. Eat, righteous man, eat. -Are you mad at me, Israel? -What did I ask of you? That you say amen on time and not an orphaned amen. -The orphaned amen of a poor widow. -You make jokes, but when a man reaches heaven, there are no more excuses. What will you say when they ask why you wore tight clothes? -What? -It looks good on her, leave her alone. Of course it looks good on her. The taxi driver thought so when he hit on her today. Is it my fault he came on to me? Really... The way you smiled when you sat in the back seat. And why take a taxi anyways? You can take Kosher bus no. 402. Why travel with those lowlifes? Stop educating me as if I'm a little girl. It's your fault I'm stuck like this. It's your fault I'm raising Israel on my own. It's your fault I had to give up a good match. Did we tell you not to marry? On the contrary, there's room for one more. I had a feeling you'd be back. Here, scratch a card. Let's see if you're lucky. -Thank you. -Here's a coin. -He didn't call. -I know. I guess it won't work out. It's hard for him, with Mother's memory and all. He can't imagine letting someone else into the house. Yes. That's why he doesn't want to get married. That's okay, no harm done. I wanted your advice on an important matter. May I... Of course, gladly. I'll open the door for you. Come on in. -Would you like a glass of tea? -No, thank you. Talk to me. I'm listening. It's just that I'm having all kinds of thoughts since I got engaged. Thoughts that... maybe I'm making a mistake. I don't think I'm the right person to give you advice. There's no one else. I'm listening. We set a date for the wedding. Everything's ready, the invitations, the band, the catering, even the photographer. Do you want me to tell you to call off the wedding? No, not at all. I don't know. I'm confused. When I go to bed at night, I'm confident I should get married, but then I wake up all upset and all I want to do is run away. Are you seeing another woman? Not exactly. There is a woman I wanted, but she didn't want me. If she didn't want you, what's the problem? That's just it, now that I'm engaged, I realize that... I feel that she does want me. I see. Explain it to me slowly, I understand quickly. I'll tell you what I would do if I were you, you decide. I would go to that woman and say. "Tell me, do you really want me?" If she says yes, then you have some thinking to do, but if she makes a face as if to say "I'm not sure", keep following the path you're on and try to forget her. Okay. That's what I thought. That's what I would do if I were you, but if I were me, I'd do something else. -What would you do? -Nothing. I'd leave well enough alone. -Hello? -Elisheva? It's Akiva. Akiva, what are you doing? You're engaged. -I have to talk to you. -Don't call me anymore. But Elisheva, it's important. Just one question. I'm listening. I want you to tell me outright that you feel nothing for me. That's it, I'll forget you forever. Elisheva? Yes? Where are you? In Bnei Brak. -Are there seats available? -Get in, righteous man. Three more people and we're off. -What's the fare? -16 shekels, no radio. Listen, I'll pay you for the empty seats and you can go. It's urgent. Did you have any problems finding the apartment? No. May I come in? Yes, of course. Just leave the door open. Listen, I'll tell you the truth. I don't know why I said you could come. -I'm glad you did. -Yes. -But you had your mind made up. -I can call it off this instant. Just tell me that's what you want me to do. I'm sure she's a sweet girl and young like you. Forget that. Just tell me one thing. If I call it off, -will we be together? -Don't call it off. -I can't, I'm sorry. -Of course you can. I don't want to. Why not? Look at my real hair. You see? It's gray... Here and here. You see? Yes, I see. Now do you understand? I'm sorry, I can't. You're so young. You look at me with those innocent eyes, you're caught in a fantasy about me, but you don't really see me. Yes I do. You're so beautiful. You see a beautiful woman, a naive woman. Like the woman I used to be. I can't, Akiva. I'm sorry. I can't do this. Do what? I can't start over again. Love, a wedding, a home, furniture, another family, more children, another life. I can't do it. I just can't do it. I want you to go back to Jerusalem, marry your bride and forget about me. If that's what you want, that's what I'll do. -Are you going to Jerusalem? -Yes. -Come with me? -No, don't wait for me. I'll stay here a while longer. Goodbye. Goodbye, Kive. Aliza? Aliza. I was worried about you. -Why don't you get back to me? -Did you call me? Once or twice. I went to your apartment last night. You weren't there. I had a meeting with that man... the American. Really? How did it go? It was extremely interesting. A special man, serious. A man who knows what he wants. Good. At least, you could have told me. I did. You told me I could go see him. If I told you to jump off the roof, would you jump off the roof? Take care, Aliza. Good luck to you. Just last week he stood by the bulletin board just like you and complained about the new copy procedure. And he was right. These procedures are out of line. -When does the mourning end? -In a couple of days. Wanna grab a bite to eat? Rabbi Shtisel, tell us something about our late father. I'll tell you something that I learned from your father. Your father taught in the school before my time and when I came here, I was given his former class. Before the school year started I called him to ask about the kids. Who is a better student, who is not so good, who are the punks, who's the troublemaker. He wouldn't tell me anything. He just said, "Why fill your head with prejudice?" He was so sensitive when it came to education. Everyone tells us that. Very nice. Very nice. "May God comfort you among all who mourn and may you grieve no more". Thank you. "May God comfort you among all who mourn and may you grieve no more". What's their name? The Yeshiva Boys. What a name for a wedding band. You'd think they're the world's righteous. Then you'll discover they've barely been circumcised. Don't ask what happened with those Yeshiva Boys. -They decided to go back to the Yeshiva? -No, no. Esti is so spoiled. Her dream is to have them perform at her wedding. Why? Because at her school they're so popular. So I called them and I'm told they're not available on that date. Fine, what can you do? But she heard that and started sobbing. I said, "Esti, no big deal. We'll find a better band. There are many bands." But she won't have it. Sobbing and sobbing. How can I see her crying like that? My wife says I melt when she cries. And it's true. Anyways, she's crying. That moment I made a decision. Come hell or high water the Yeshiva Boys will perform at her wedding. I picked up the phone and said, "I'll give you another 250 dollars if you perform for us." He agreed. Very nice. Now, it's not something... that we didn't discuss, but I was thinking... Of course, we'll chip in. If that's what the bride wants, that's what she'll get. The same thing happened to me with Esti. Tell us. During our last date, before we got engaged. I... was going to tell her that I don't want to see her anymore, that my heart is not in it. It's true. I wanted someone else, not her. But then she started sobbing and just as you say, I couldn't take it so I said, "Esti, let's get married." Come on, that's enough nonsense. I'd love to hear all about it but we still have lots of checks to sign. Rabbi Chaim, what's next? What do you mean, your heart is not in it? Forget about it, that's all in the past. He's just happy and excited. Answer me, does your heart seek another woman? -Of course not, Rabbi Gottlieb. -That's the truth. Rabbi Gottlieb, please. He doesn't mean it. My daughter is no man's consolation prize. I should have listened to my wife. She told me that your son is too peculiar. Be well. -Get up, go after him. -Why, did he forget something? Go on, go! Go dig my grave, what are you waiting for? Are you trying to ruin your life? Are you? You want to run over your life with a big tractor? Why? Answer me. Don't keep silent now! At least, this way you won't be alone. I'm going to evening prayer, when I get back, I don't want to see you here. You don't mean that. Father. Father. -How many do you have? -Eleven. They're all the same price, right? -No, this is more expensive. -Why? It says here, no monosodium. Who cares about monosodium? I want monosodium. Lots of monosodium. All right, Sir, no one is forcing you. Should I put this back? What is this, a cake? Yes, it's called Stollen. Like in Berlin. Lots of butter, raisins, almonds, nuts, and other good things. A rich man's cake. Since when does a cake cost 60 shekels? It's very special. It's baked at the start of winter. The longer it stands, the better it tastes. Okay then. How much for all this monosodium? HOME OF ELIEZER SHRAGA CHESHIN I don't know if you remember me. My name is Shulem. I worked with your late husband for many years. Of course, Shtisel. Now I remember. How are you? The mourning ended yesterday. I know. I just wanted to say that I know what it's like to become widowed. I lost my wife a little over a year ago. I know what you're going through, it's not easy. Especially when Rabbi Cheshin was such a special man. Men like him are hard to come by. This is a very special cake. It's baked at the beginning of winter and you wait a long time, even a year, until it's good. Thank you. If you need anything, please call me. Anything, don't hesitate. Thank you, good evening. Take care. May you only have good tidings. Kive? Kive?
