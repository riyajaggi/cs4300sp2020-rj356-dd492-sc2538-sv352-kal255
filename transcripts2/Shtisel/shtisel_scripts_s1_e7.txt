 You see all these paintings? They're all mine, right? The only thing that's genuinely mine is the signature on the bottom. PREVIOUSLY ON SHTISEL He pays me to paint for him. He doesn't know how to paint, -he only signs the paintings. -Like a ghost writer? I'm a ghost painter. This is for you. I don't understand. You can't just come here. I wanted to ask what fault you found in me.

 I have a job, I'm healthy, I want to marry Elisheva. -I can't, I'm sorry. -Of course you can. I don't want to. But why? I don't know when Father will be back. I don't know if he's ever coming back. -Hello, Giti, it's me. -What do you want? -I want to come home. -Lippe, it will soon be Shabbat. -Good Shabbas. -Goodbye, good Shabbas. I want to work for you. Your husband works in Argentina. Give me the money and refer the customers to me. I'll do the rest. Abot Barkai Productions

Do you remember what I need from Sternbuch? -Four big carps. -Exactly. Make sure he takes them from the tank. -Can you change 35 euros to dollars? -Just a minute. Can you get that? It might not be him. Excuse me, I have to get that, it could be from overseas. Excuse me. Hello? No, we don't give donations over the phone. Goodbye. This makes me so mad. Why do you have to wait around for that man to call? Don't call your father "that man." How long has it been since he called? Three days? Four? He doesn't care that you're waiting. That's enough, Ruchami. Please. Fine, I'm going. Take the money from that man. That man is gone. No harm done. -Don't forget the fish. He closes at 6 pm. -Alright, Mother. Goodbye. Give me your money. I'm warning you. Do you see this knife? Give me the money, quick! Your watch too! Give me the money. Scoundrel. Villain. Get out of here. -Do you see my knife? -Get out of my house! Villain! Insolent! -Stop shouting. -Get out, you foul man! I hope you get your beard cut off, you villain! We have seven minutes left until the end of the lesson. Can anyone tell me what event is coming up this week? -Yes? -The weekly portion quiz? No, not in school. Something that will happen in the sky. Raise your hand if you know the answer. No one knows? This week there will be a solar eclipse. I want to show you something in that regard. Shtiglitz, turn off the light. Just a second. -Can everybody see? -Yes. This large bulb in the middle is the sun. The balls are the planets. Earth is a planet too. This is Earth. This is how someone in outer space sees us. What do the planets do? They revolve around the sun. Even now, when we're in school, they are constantly revolving. Rabbi, you look just like God. You mustn't say that, Zigelman. Your rabbi is merely flesh and blood. Yes, Rabbi Shulem, how can I help you? You tell me. You barely gave me half. Let me see. Yes. I've been meaning to talk to you. To all the rabbis, I mean. There's been a delay with the pensions. Some problem or other. Prayers and effort. It'll be fine. Do me a favor, take care of this. It's my bread and butter. Am I the only one who's come to you about this? Don't worry, we'll find a solution. Fine. Blessings and success. -Rabbi Shulem. -What? Nothing, forgive me. I got confused. As I said, a lot of prayers and effort. It'll be just fine. -Shtisel, you're here. -How are you? How am I? Do you know what the definition of a nudge is? I don't think so. A nudge is a Jew who when asked, "How are you?" he actually tells you. Okay, what is this all about? What's what about? You said you have a special job. Oh that, yes. Look at this. What a nice gift I got. It's very nice. I want you to paint me one just like that. What do you mean? Do I have to translate everything I say? Look, Shtisel, it's tradition. All the great artists paint self-portraits. You want me to paint your self-portrait? I was going to let Sasha do it, but you'll do a much better job. Okay. Shtisel, thank you. I expect something out of this world. That's beautiful, my little artist. Where did you get the idea to draw the planets? We learned about them in school. There's going to be a solar eclipse this week. The rabbi explained it to us with this beautiful contraption. Rabbi Akiva? Yes, and you know what else? -What? -When there's a solar eclipse, the animals think it's nighttime and behave as if it's nighttime. The sheep go to their pens, the crickets start to chirp, the bats emerge from their caves. -The rabbi told you all that? -Yes, and lots of other things too. The lesson was so much fun. Was the rabbi happy or sad? He was fine, I don't know. -Are you getting that? -Yes. Hello? Who was it? Wrong number I guess. How are things between you and Mrs. Rotstein? -Who? -Elisheva Rotstein, your widow from the bank. The woman you wanted... Why are you asking? I want to dance with a broom at your wedding. You'll dance with a broom even if she's my bride? Why not? At the time, when you were normal, I wanted you to find a normal woman, but now that you've ruined your reputation and you're second hand goods, why not? Go ahead. I wish you all the best. Father, sit down. The food is nearly ready. Kive, you've already broken my heart. I'm just saying that I understand that you called off your engagement because of that widow of yours at the bank. I'll tell you the truth, Father. I'm trying, I really am. She seems to want me, but she doesn't want to commit at this time. Let me tell you something, okay? As your father and as a Jew who has been around a little longer than you, with all due respect. -I'm listening. -Not like that. Look at me. Listen, Kive. Things move on earth just as they do in the sky. The sun stands firm and the planets circle the sun. Earth, the moon, they all circle around it. Now, if the sun starts to turn as well, what do you think will happen? There'll be some serious chaos with the prayer times, that's for sure. Don't be a clown. Understand one simple fact. You have to be like the sun. If you stand firm like the sun, if you're self-confident, she will start revolving around you. Like the wedding ceremony, she will circle you and seek light and warmth, everything the sun provides. But if you revolve around her like an ass, what do you expect? Times have changed, Father. Things are not the same as they were in your days. Times change, but the Jew remains the same and the sun is the same sun. -Yes? -Shulem, how are you? Thank God, Mother. How are you? Is everything alright? It would be if Rebbetzin Erblich hadn't told me that Giti was robbed in her own home. Giti? Robbed? When? Are you sure? Today. She told me today. You speak to her, I'll put her on. I'm going right over there. Shalom, listen what happened with... -What happened? -Trouble with your sister. WEISS FAMILY Father. What a wonderful surprise. -How are you, Gitaleh. -Thank God, all's well. All's well? Are you sure? What is it Father, why are you asking? No reason. Rebbetzin Erblich told Grandma Malka that you were robbed, something like that. It must be very boring in the old folks' home. When did it happen, Giti? Why didn't you tell me? The children don't know. Neither does Ruchami. Did you call the police? Father, I'm fine. Really. Some bumbling fool came here with a toy knife. Nothing dangerous. Not to mention that he didn't get a shekel. -Did you talk to the police? -What for? So that they close down my exchange? You think I have a permit? I'll tell you the truth, I never thought it was a good idea, you having an exchange in your home. But it's going very well. I mean it, Father, don't worry. Even without the robbery, think of how it looks. People coming and going... No one comes in. They stand outside the door. Gitaleh, listen to me. Forget about this exchange business, at least until Lippe gets back from Argentina, alright? -I can't afford to. -Why not? Isn't the money that Lippe sends you enough? I don't like talking about it, Father. Enough, I'm a big girl. I'm paying six mortgages, that's fine, but I'll help you. I'll give you money, anything. Close down the exchange, okay? Thank you, Father, but no. -At least let me talk to Lippe. -No! I have it under control... and I'm done talking about it. Are you staying for dinner? No, some other time. What can I say, your sister is a strong woman. If robbers came to my house, I'd lock myself in the bathroom, let them take whatever they want. -How many robbers were there? -One. What's the difference? You don't mess with an armed robber. Speaking of robbers, Wasserstein has some nerve. Exploiting hard working Jews, not even informing them. Do you think Wasserstein is the robber? You and your jokes again. Who is he exploiting? I guess you didn't look at your pay slip. I did. Why? What's the problem? How much was it? The usual amount? Yes. -Yours wasn't? -Something was off... Never mind. Gruner, can I ask you something? Did you get your usual salary this month? Yes, why do you ask? -How about you, Zilberman? -The same. -And you, Feurstein? -What's that? Was your pay check the same as always? -Why wouldn't it be? -Why, wasn't yours? No, not at all. I just wanted to make sure you got your salaries and that everything's okay. Everyone leave your Bibles on the desk and follow me in two lines quietly, like a German wedding. Follow me. Come in. Sit down nicely on the floor. That's it, excellent. Markovitch, you stand up. You're our cantor today. Read psalm 130, verse by verse, and everyone repeat after him as loud as you can. Go ahead, Markovitch. "Song of Ascents. Out of the depths have I called Thee, God." "Song of Ascents. Out of the depths have I called Thee, God." "Lord, hearken unto my voice. Let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications." Louder! "Let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications." What is going on here? Wasserstein, you told me it will take prayer and effort and as far as I can tell, I'm the only one in the school with this problem. So I'm making an effort. Louder. "For with Thee there is forgiveness, that Thou mayest be feared." Rabbi Shtisel, in my office. I want to talk to you in private. "I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in His word do I hope..." Children, I'm going in with the principal. In the meantime, you continue reciting the Psalms. I want to hear you loud and clear. Go ahead, Markovitch. "My soul waiteth for the Lord..." Okay, I'm listening. Rabbi Shtisel, I should have talked to you earlier. Fine, get to the point. Your reduced wages this month... are in fact your pension. My pension? Have I retired? No, I know you haven't. It's just that... How old are you? -Sixty-two? -Yes. Do you remember that two years ago the committee instated a regulation that we don't employ anyone beyond the age of 60? They want new blood, you know... -But the decision was canceled. -It wasn't. Look... -Your late wife, Dvora, yes? -What's she got to do with it? She came to my house and begged me to keep you on, that you not go into retirement. I told her we have our rules. I won't get a salary for someone who is over 60 and even though I'm the principal, rules are rules. My Dvora came to your house? I don't believe a word you're saying. Never mind. Go on. Your wife came back to me two or three days later with signed checks. Not your checks, Rabbi Shulem, I think they're your mother's. I'll show you. Checks? What checks? I wrote a check for each month for the difference between your salary and your pension. I deposited the check in the school's bank account and paid you a full salary. I ran out of checks last month. I tried to find an alternative. I was going to talk to your mother but you beat me to it. Here it is. I do appreciate you as a teacher, I really do. If you want to stay on as a volunteer, I can only bless you for that. But perhaps... the time has come for you to retire. "Blessed Are You God, King of the World, through whose word everything comes into being." Shtisel, you didn't bring what I asked for. No. I want to take a new photograph. You have a camera, don't you? I do, but what's wrong with the picture I gave you? Oh, look. Look at the book, look at the picture you gave me. You'll know what I mean. -You see what I mean, right? -Yes, of course I do. Just tell me what it is I'm supposed to see. Look at his eyes. Look at his gaze. It's the gaze of a man looking into himself. A man who won't lie to himself. A man who has searched into his soul into the things only he knows about himself. You see? Now, look at this picture you gave me. That smile. Not to mention, I can hardly see your eyes. Listen, Shtisel, you're no fool. You're right, all these people are so serious. Shtisel, quick. The camera is in the drawer, by your leg. Take some pictures quickly before I lose all my clients. Quickly. Sit here. Are you ready? Hold on. I have to tell you, don't think about how the painting will come out. -Think about real things. -Whatever you say. Think about the mistakes you made throughout your life. The things you regret... but that you can't change. Shtisel, do I look like a man who makes mistakes? Think about the true loves you had and where they are today. All the lies that surround your life. Old age that is right around the corner. Your greatest fears. What scares you, Leib Fuchs? That's enough of that nonsense. Give me the camera. Paint the portrait just as I asked you to do. -But it's a shame. -What's a shame? All the time that you're wasting, that's a shame. Call the special unit to the base, it's urgent... What happened? Not now. They always cut the stories at the height of the drama. You rang the bell for a long time, just like Rebbetzin Erblich. That's why I said, "Not now." I can guess why you don't like her visiting you. I do, but lately she keeps asking me to come smoke with her in the yard. Since when do you smoke, Mother? Hardly ever. Once in a while, it helps me think about things that I see here. You wouldn't believe what goes on in this world. Like what I told you yesterday, about the robbers. You mean Giti? That was true. It wasn't on TV, Mother. How is she? Did you go to see her? Don't worry about Giti, she is strong. And you? You don't look so good. You've got that right. Maybe you should lie down. Shall I sit on the chair while you lie down in my bed? No, no, God forbid. What's this? These are my checks. It's your check book that the school used behind my back to pay my salary. Did you know about this, Mother? Yes... so you wouldn't have to retire. Was this your idea? It was Dvora's idea. What kind of crazy idea is this? But why do you have the checks? I thought you didn't know about it. Like some little boy who was sent to summer camp. A stupid, little boy. What right did she have? How could she do this to me? And behind my back! Don't shout. She remembered what happened with her father in law. What does Father have to do with this? Twenty years ago, when your father was 70, he left the shop and retired. You bought him a wooden prayer stand that said, "They shall still bring forth fruit in old age," remember? -Of course I remember. -And then what happened? He was no longer himself, he got a stroke, Three more months of Psalms and elevators in the hospital and that was it, it was over. Dvora was afraid that would happen to you. But what... Never mind, I think I'll go now. I've never felt so foolish in my life. Smack me if I understand what she was thinking. Why smack you? You're just fine. I'm angry at myself. I feel like such a fool. All this time I thought I'm this strong man, but it turns out it was all a circus. Tell me, this circus, as you call it, why do you think she did it, if not for you to be strong? Go see Reuven to approve the loan. -He's in his office. -Thank you. Have a good day. Hello. -I want to withdraw 10,000 shekels. -Of course. Let me see if it's possible. I'm sorry, Sir, you can only withdraw 3,100 shekels at the most. I need 10,000, not 3,100. I'll talk to the manager and see what we can do, alright? Thank you. Sign here and here. Rabbi Shtisel, can I offer you a glass of water? No thank you, I'm just waiting for the clerk. I'll drink at home. You look a little weak. I will have some. Thank you. "Blessed Are You God, King of the World through whose word everything comes into being." Thank you very much. Thank you. Watch this. I'm going to get the Admor of Sadigura and the Admor of Zanz in one try. Yes! Your turn. Open the upper lock, Yosa'le, just the way I showed you. -Are you here for the exchange? -Is it here? Mother! -Yes, may I help you? -Can you please? -Into dollars? -Yes. Excuse me, may I use your bathroom? No, I'm afraid not. Wait by the door, I'll bring you your money. I'm very clean, if I could... No, you can't. Just a minute! Father. How are you? -Here you go, 240 dollars. -Thank you. Hold on, Father, I'll open the door. How are you, dears? -Hello, Grandfather. -Hello, Grandfather. Hello. What is it, Father? Are you here to exchange money? This is 10,000 shekels for you. I want to ask that the nice Jew who just went downstairs be your last customer. Father. -At least until Lippe returns. We've already discussed this. I don't want to cause you grief, Father. I'm not here to argue, Giti. Please, take the money. -I told you that they-- -I'm begging you. Giti, please. Let me help you while I still can. Are you alright? I'm sorry, Father. I don't know what came over me. I... I felt weak all of a sudden. It's nothing. I can't take your money, Father. I'll leave it here and you decide. You can give it back later, if you want to. No, Father, thank you. Sit down, I'll make us something to drink. I think I will sit down. Hello. Hello, Giti, it's me. How are you? How am I? I'm sorry I didn't call, I was very busy. Yes? There was a robber in the house a few days ago. -What? -A robber. He threatened me with a knife. Yehoshua was home too. Really? -Son of a bitch. -Don't curse. You're right, I'm sorry. What happened? Are you alright? I can barely fall asleep since then. I'd show him if I were home. I'd kill him. What did he take? I threw him out. Just the gold watch you gave me when we got engaged. You threw him out? Really, Giti? You've never heard me scream like I did. Good job. You're a real hero. I mean it. Yes, a real hero. I mean it. I'm proud of you. Well then, I'll try to call you tomorrow, okay? -No, Lippe, don't go yet. -Okay. -Lippe. -What? I don't want to be a hero, nor do I want to be a miserable wretch who everyone pities and wants to help, you hear me? Yes. If you want to be the father of this family, you have to be by my side. Do this the right way. Alright, Giti, I'll do it the right way. With God's help next week I'm supposed to start a new job and then I'll be able to send you money again. You know what? Even better. I'll buy a ticket home and I'll come back as I am. I don't care if anyone makes fun of my beard. No. Wait until it grows back. All right. Giti, you mean so much to me, I mean it. You and the children. Lippe... I want to cry, okay? I just want to cry while you listen, all right? Okay, I'm here. Excuse me. This is for you. -What is it? -A gift.
