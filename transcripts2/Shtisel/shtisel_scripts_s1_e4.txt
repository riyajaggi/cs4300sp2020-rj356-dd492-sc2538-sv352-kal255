 Cinematography Roey Roth Editor Etty Li-on Zingman Screenplay Yehonatan Indursky and Ori Elon Executive Producer Dikla Barkai Executive Producer Jonathan Aroch Director Alon Zingman SHTISEL Zvi Arie. Zvi Arie, get up. I can hear him, he's in the room. Zvi Arie! God Almighty, it's 4:30 a.m., Tovi. I can hear him, he's here, behind the dresser. What do you want me to do? Go to the kitchen, get the trap, put it behind the dresser. Tovi, I need my sleep. Rabbi Zimmerman is recommending someone for the job this week. Fine, go to sleep, I'll just be scared here on my own. All right. Get the "mice-rabbi" too. You scared him off. -Did you put cheese? -Yes. -And cornflakes? -Yes. Good, thank you. About this new job, do you know what the terms are? If you ask me, you should have gotten the job two years ago. But no one is asking you or me, are they Tovi? Besides, his name is Rabbi Shiale of Carster. -Whose name? -The mouse's... ...The Rabbi's. Shimon hailed a taxi. I sat in front and said to the driver, "To the Kotel." So he turns around to Shimon and says, "The lady says the Kotel. Who do I listen to, her or you?" So Shimon says, "You listen to me." Shimon's that midget grandson of yours, right? He's not that short. Do you want to listen or ask questions? I ask so I can envision it more clearly. Anyways, the taxi stops at this restaurant, and what a restaurant! With lamps in front, servants who help you with your coat. Oh my... Unbelievable, isn't it? And before I know it, we go inside and I see the entire family, and I mean everyone. Do you know how many offspring I have? Close to 100, bless their hearts. Everyone sang "A Woman of Valor" and in the middle there was this big chocolate cake with 80 candles! How lovely! They'll give me the video of the event, I'll show you. Remind me, when did you turn 80? I'm 88, so it was 8 years ago. Don't you like it? Is this why I've lived almost 90 years? For a plate of porridge? It's nice, the way you capture them so accurately. -Thank you. -Did you learn to draw? Once, when I was a child. They're closer together. I wasn't drawing them... You remember I said you should have a cellphone? Yes. Here, now you have one. It's my father's old phone. He bought a new one, but this works just fine. May I? It has a camera, a multimedia player, a dictaphone. You're so talented, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it in no time. I'll call you so you can save my number. I was about to enter Esti Gottlieb, but I'll soon be Esti Shtisel... Yes. I'll just write Esti for now. Thank you. Salutations. Leib Fuchs. -Leib Fuchs? The painter? -The artist. How do you know me? I saw an article about you in the Community magazine. That's nice. It was a fine article. Who's the Rebbetzin? This is my bride to be. -We got engaged a week ago. -Really? Mazal tov! I understand you also dabble in art. Yes, a little. -Can I see your drawings? -It's... This is a new notebook. There's not much in it. -Do you use color sometimes? -Yes, sometimes. Do you have a job? No. Not yet. Come, see me at my gallery. Here's my address. Can we come now? How about it, Esti? -We have time. -Of course we do. No, no, some other time, Shtisel. Come on your own. And bring me your drawings. -Take care. -Take care. -Here, Grandfather. -Let's go, Hanaleh. Shulem, I'm glad you're here. I'll make us a cup of tea. Shulem, do you know what happened two weeks ago? Remind me. Your parents got married 70 years ago. Really... Mint tea or regular tea? Forget the tea. Listen to me, it's important. Your anniversary, I'm listening. Maybe... you're planning a surprise. -Are you? -Planning what? You tell me. 70 years is a big deal. Look, I made a list... I want the whole family to attend. and make it as much a surprise as possible. With songs and wishes for us. Who is "us"? Your father and mother. Don't you think we deserve it? Of course, you do. But how do you want Father to get there? By taxi? If only you knew what taxi Erblich's grandchildren arranged for her. Father has been in heaven for many years now. Really, Mother! Fine, he's in heaven, but we're still married. And he's saving me a place next to him. Heaven is segregated, men on one side, women on the other. Shulem, I'm putting you in charge of the party. Just make sure it's a surprise. I don't want to know what song you'll sing for us or what performance you'll be putting on. You decide, but read this, I wrote it all down. A nice presentation, good wishes. Maybe all the great granddaughters can perform a dance when the men go to evening prayer. I can't be in charge, Mother. Akiva is getting married in 3 months. I'm very busy. All right. I'll think of someone else. Mother, can you lower it please? You know I can't watch this. Mother... I'm tired. Goodbye, Shulem. Come back some other time. I want to lie down. Fine. I'll come back tomorrow. Goodbye, Mother. -Hello. -Giti? -Can you hear me? -Yes, Grandmother. -How are you? -Well, thank God. Listen, I have an assignment for you. Something very interesting. I'd love to hear about it, Grandma, but can I call you back later? Can you come by tomorrow? -Is that convenient? -Of course. I'll be there. Wonderful, sweetheart. I'll be waiting in my room. -Hello. -Great, goodbye, Grandma. -Hello, Iris. Welcome. -Hi, Giti. -I can't believe you mopped the floor. -Don't be silly. I finished all the rest, might as well keep busy. You can rest from time to time. There's nothing wrong with that. I see we have a guest! Yes, Yehoshua. Hello. What a sweetie! Yes. -Which one is this? -My fifth. Wow. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, it's just that he still needs me. It's okay, but... I'll tell you what. Let me make sure it can't get me into trouble in terms of insurance, you bringing children here, okay? -Insurance? -If something happens... -God forbid, why would... -I'll look into it. In the meantime, don't bring the children, okay? This is for today. Do you mind that it's in dollars? I can check if I have shekels. -That's okay, thank you. -It is? "He that sees into your heart." There's no lying under those eyes. Rembrandt! Come, the kid is here. Akiva, Sasha. Sasha, Akiva. You both know me... -Can I get you something to drink? -No, thank you. Sasha, get us something to drink. Did you bring your drawings? I wouldn't call them drawings, more like doodling. Here you go. Thank you. "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, through Whose word -everything comes into being." -Amen. Let's see what we have here. The kid has talent, doesn't he, Sasha? This is very special. It must be your bride. I heard you're getting married. No, it's no one in particular. It's someone you love, that's for sure. Guys, the day is short and the triangle is square. Shtisel, listen up. This is my offer: No matter what you decide, this conversation remains between us. You don't tell anyone. Not your father, not your bride, not your sister. Got it? You see all these paintings? They're all mine, right? But what is genuinely mine is the signature on the bottom. Do you understand? No, I'm not sure I do. What's there to not understand? It's very simple. In recent years, Sasha has painted the pictures for me. Before him it was Gabriel. Never mind. What matters is that recently there has been a big demand and that's where you come in to the picture, literally. You hear me? Hold on, you're confusing me. You want me to do the paintings? Hold on, I didn't say you got the job. First we have to test you. Then you can start working. Take this. Put it here. Don't spend it all at once. No pressure, let's say in another 4 days. Sasha will show you our studio. Okay, it's agreed then. That's it, Shtisel, you can go. When you come back with a painting you'll get another 400, if it's a good one, that is. -Hi, Akiva, how are you? -Have you signed the mortgage? -Anshin. -What can I get you, Akiva? Two large plates of kugel. At least eight servings. Potato kugel and noodle kugel. And give me a large Coke. Thanks. I'm sitting here with the gang. How do you explain the same pizza parlor burning down over and over again? Idelman. Fire, ovens, no arson. -Don't be suspicious of Jews. -Of course. All the cars on Shabbat in Tel Aviv have women -in labor in them. Am I right, Akiva? -Oh, come on. And they're going to deliver their baby at the beach. What a clown. Here you go. -Thank you. -Here's your change. Thanks. -Go on, dig in, before it gets cold. -What's this? Compensation for not inviting us to your engagement? Believe me, you didn't miss a thing. But you know what? Anshin! -What? -Bring us some drinks. We have to make a toast. Just a few days ago, this man couldn't get out of bed. Now he has a cute bride, a good job and even a cellphone. Is that not a reason to make a toast? If you're happy, I'm happy for you, Akiva. Shtisel, don't be like all those guys who find a bride, get married and forget their friends. They forget where they come from. Don't worry, Pinchik. I'll leave a memory of the destruction of the Temple in my heart. Here you go, Farshlufen. Elchi. Levi Yitzhak. -Lechaim. -Lechaim. Lechaim. "Blessed are You, Lord our God, through Whose word -everything comes into being." -Amen. Why is sailing three days before Shabbat forbidden, even inside city boundaries? The commentaries say, lest he build himself a raft. But there are other reasons. Does anyone know them? Rabbi Hananel discussed his concern for Oneg Shabbat. That was Rabbi Isaac Alfasi. Rabbi Hananel was concerned with traveling beyond the boundaries, Rabbi Isaac Alfasi questioned this. Why say for a mitzvah, it is permitted? He quotes nullifying the enjoyment of Shabbat. The Rambam says it's related to salty water, but no concern when it came to sweet water. there was no concern when it came to sweet water. That's correct. Does anyone know what Rashbam says there? It's in Tosfos, Tractate Eruvin, page 43, side 1. Bet Shamai says one must not start work on the eve of Shabbat even if the work ends automatically. That's right. Let's get back to business. Do you want your pacifier? What's wrong? I've been walking around with him for two hours. You see? I tried to stay away. Okay, that's enough. We don't have mice! We had two exterminators. Two, not one. -They said there are no mice. -Yes there are! Stop already. All... All my life I've been waiting for someone to offer me a job, so I can make a difference. Now that it's about to happen... I'll lose it because of some non-existent mouse. But he does exist. I saw him in the living room, I almost dropped Elazar Menachem because of it. -Really? -Yes. -What color was it? -Scary gray. And I'm not going back in until you get rid of it. There's nothing I can say. Go to your mother's. I have to go back in. -Yes? -Hello, Tovi, how are you? -It's Giti. -Fine. -I'm outside with Elazar Menachem. -Good. Write this down in your calendar, this Monday, Grandma and Grandpa's platinum anniversary. Grandma Malka? -But Grandpa has been... -Yes, I know. -I'm putting you down for two cakes. -Okay, I'll ask Zvi Arie. He'll get a task of his own. I'm calling the women first. Don't forget the clothes. -And come in Shabbat attire. -Sure, no problem. Great, Tovi, talk to you later. Come in. Here's 400. You're mistaken, sir. Erblich handles the currency, at the end of the corridor. -Forgive me. -That's okay. I want to invite Rebbetzin Erblich too, but only once everyone is here. Rebbetzin Erblich exchanges money in her room? Didn't you know? She did it for years in her home. Now that her husband is dead, they come here. If anyone asks they say they're her grandchildren. Who's next on the list? What do you want Father to do? Your father? Nothing. Don't discuss this with him. Why not? Did something happen? No. Just a minute. Come in. Hello, Rebbetzin Erblich. My name is Giti. I'm Malka Shtisel's granddaughter. I know who you are. -Your husband works in Argentina. -That's right. -I hear you buy dollars. -Nonsense. -Who told you that? -My grandmother. How much do you have? Fifty dollars. Here. I always tell new people that there are cameras, but you're Malka's granddaughter. So... This is for you. Say hello to your grandmother. Take care, sweetheart. Thank you. What is your rate of exchange? -The rate of exchange? -The current rate is 4.1. -How much did I give you? -195, at 3.9. -It should be 205. -Give me that. I'm telling you, 10, 20... My husband finally did me a favor and died but people still come to me with their dirty money. It's not dirty money. I earned it. Be quiet, I'm trying to count. Even the late Rabbi Erblich made mistakes sometimes. Thank you, Mrs. Erblich. Rebbetzin Erblich, I want to work for you. What? You said you've had enough. Let me do it for you. Do what, for God's sake? I'm very good at math. You give me the money and refer clients to me and I'll do the rest. Why would you want to do this? I'll get 50 percent of the commission and it will pay off for both of us. Thirty. Forty-five. Forty, done. -Who is that? -It's a self portrait. -It is? -Yes, it's me. Look closely, you'll see it's me. Are you bringing it to Leib Fuchs? I don't bring real paintings to Leib Fuchs. I don't have time. I'm up to my ears in debt and until I pay it back, I'm Leib Fuchs' slave. I've never seen a painting like this. Have you ever been to a museum? -Only in the part with the synagogues. -Then you should go. Not all the paintings are real, but they have some nice things. Let's get to work. I'll teach you the easiest way. I've never painted like that. It's not really a painting, it's a copy. When you work on your own painting, you'll paint it from the heart. For Leib Fuchs, this is more professional. You know what I mean? -May I? -Sure. Gentle with the eyelashes. So it doesn't look like makeup. You're a fast learner. Freddy, come here. Freddy, come. Come. Ilana. My neighbor. I know her name from the mailbox. -She loves her dog. -Very much. I think I'm in love with her. Does she know? I don't think so. I've never talked to her. Why not? Is she very beautiful? No, very ordinary. -You're just saying that you love her. -No I'm not. I really love her. I would marry her tonight. But where's the logic? My heart got used to her. I paint in here. Every morning I hear her opening her door, saying goodbye to her dog, when she leaves the dog cries, waits for her. Then she comes back at around 4. "Hello, Freddy, sweetie." Day in and day out. Why don't you talk to her? I've never had a chance, but... you're marrying a woman that you don't really know either. That's just a myth. We met a few times before we got engaged and we'll meet many times before the wedding. You don't get to know someone from a few meetings. But if you live with a woman, you hear her waking up, you hear her leaving the house, entering the house, putting on a kettle, you see her slippers waiting for her by the bed, you get used to her. Then you fall in love. MEMO LIST DELETE ALL Hello. Mother? Israel? Is anyone home? -Hello. -Akiva? Can you hear me? -Do you really have a cellphone? -Yes, Grandmother, hello. -I can't talk right now. -Enjoy your new cellphone. Show it to me when you come to the party. -Did you get an invitation? -Of course I did, Grandma. But let's talk some other time, okay? I just want you to know I expect you to prepare a surprise. -What surprise? -A surprise. I don't care what. You're my most talented grandchild, I'm counting on you. You know what, Grandma, I'll prepare a wonderful surprise. I'll talk to you soon. Goodbye. -Hello. Can I help you? -Hello. -Do you sell mice? -Yes, we have beautiful mice. -I'll show you. -How much does a mouse cost? I'll show you, then we'll discuss the price. Look, how sweet. The thing is, I need a scary mouse. A scary mouse? Not scary, an ordinary mouse, a gray one. I don't have a gray one, I have a black one. -Black is good. How much does it cost? -It's on sale now for 25 shekels. -25 shekels is a sale price? -Yes. What if... I'm not satisfied, can I return it after a day or two? Why wouldn't you be satisfied? I'm not sure the kids will like him. If the kids don't like him, bring him back, I'll give you a full refund. Come pick one out. What is this? Mother made photo albums for everybody, only my pictures are scattered all over the place. I can barely find one picture. You hardly took any pictures of me. There are advantages to being the youngest child, on the other hand, the parents get tired. Why do I have to suffer? Why are you looking for pictures? I have to prepare a surprise for the party. What party? Didn't you get an assignment for Grandma's party? You mean the anniversary party? Is that really happening? Look. What's to see? Look at the love. The love of one day after another. Very nice. Very nice. I'm going to lie down. Mother, it's me. Why are you whispering? -Can you hear me now? -Yes. -How are you, my sweet child? -Well, thank God. Listen, Mother, I've been thinking about it, if you want me to. I'll help you organize the party for you and for my late father. No, my darling. Giti is in charge, she's planning the whole thing. Good, good. Tell me what my assignment is. I'm busy, but if it means that much to you, I'll make time. Honestly, I don't think there's anything left to do. -Are you sure? Nothing? -Nothing. Go and rest. It's important. I got you! I got you? I got you, you evil creature. I got him. -How did you do it, Zvi Arie? Good job. -Thank God. Now we'll be rid of him once and for all. And you suspected I was imagining it. -Admit it. -Not at all, Tovi. If anyone is suspect in this house, it's me. -Suspected of what? -What? Suspected of what? Nothing. I have to get back to the Yeshiva. I... I have to put in an appearance. What are you going to do with it? -I'll release it on the way to Yeshiva. -No! He'll come back! It's not a dog, Tovi, it's a mouse. What do you want me to do? I don't know, promise to release it in a far away forest. Very far away. I promise. On my way back, I go by the forest near Sanhedria, I'll release it there, okay? -You promise? -I promise. -Is your mother home? -Mother, it's for you! -Hello. How can I help you? -Are you Weiss? I got your address from Erblich. -Yes, how much do you want to change? -I have 340 Euros. Thank you. Wait here, please. Here you go. -Thank you. -Have a good day. Shall we continue tomorrow, Shtisel? I'm very tired. Even Ilana's sleeping by now. -Do you hear Freddy's breathing? -Yes. Do you mind if I work just a little bit more? You can make corrections tomorrow morning. I want to finish this painting before the party. Making a grandmother happy is a great thing. My grandmother is far away. -Goodnight, Shtisel. -Goodnight. It's nice, but... -But what? -It's not what I had in mind. I told you to copy a picture. Does this look like a copy to you? I know, but... I felt that if I remove the... It's not about feeling, Shtisel, it's very simple. This is nice for your first time, -but you still have a lot to learn. -Yes. Wait. -Speak Hebrew, please. -Hebrew, yes. How can I help you? We're looking for a painting with a Yiddish feel. Of course, look around. All my paintings have a Yiddish feel. Here... This is the Rabbi from Belz, this is the Rabbi from Lubavitch. Maybe you like this, a man with a violin. Please do. We like this one. You have very good taste. I completed it this morning. You feel? It's still fresh. Oh my, I didn't even get around to signing it. Look at that. Wait a minute. I'll be back in a minute. I was going to keep this painting. It's a present for my grandmother. You know what they say, if you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans. L. FUCHS Take this. Just as we agreed. Here... 400. And this is from me, a bonus. Hello. How are you, Rabbi? Well, thank God, Rabbi Herschel. I'm glad that you're staying in the Yeshiva after all. After all? -Didn't you hear the news? -What news? Rabbi Mordechai Kirshtein got the job. He did? I didn't know. Fine, it's okay. You've been tired lately, not entirely focused. Yes, I was... Never mind. -The main thing is you're staying here. -Yes. -Of course, why wouldn't I? -Great. Okay, get back to the Talmud. Shtisel, you forgot your bag. MALCHUT WAXBERGER MEMENTOS FOR OCCASIONS DONATION OF ABRAHAM ROSENTHAL AND HIS DAUGHTER MASHA PARENTS HOME AND HOSPICE FOR THE ELDERLY Hello? Amit? How are you? -Is your mother home? -Yes, should I get her? No, no. Just tell her I won't be coming anymore. -You won't? -It was nice meeting you. Tell your mother thank you from me. -Okay. -Amit... Remember I once told you you don't have to recite a blessing when you drink water? -Yes. -I lied. You should recite a blessing for every sip and crumb just like I do. -Okay. -Take care, sweetie. -Here's Zvi Arie. -Goodbye. Sweetie, come to me. My boy. Your Bar Mitzvah soon? Mazal tov, Grandmother. -Be well. -Be well. Isn't Kive with you? Here he is. Lucky we didn't ask about the Rabbi from Lubavitch. Will you be late to your wedding too? How long have you been waiting? -I'm sorry, Esti. -That's okay. -But where's the surprise? -There is no surprise. What happened? I didn't paint anything. Mazal tov, Grandmother. May you live until 120. I worked so hard to prepare a surprise but... -it got ruined. -Never you mind. I'm glad you're here with your bride. That's the best gift I could receive. Children, one week before Grandfather got his stroke, he showed me the holes in his favorite sweater and asked me to mend them. Velvale, in the last month and a half before you passed away, we were... by your bedside. I forgot about the sweater and I cried so much that I forgot how happy we were all those years. What a privilege. Look, I mended the sweater and everyone is here, thank God. Thank you all. Thank you all. And see thy children's children And see thy children's children, Peace be upon Israel! And see thy children's children And see thy children's children Peace be upon Israel! And see thy children's children Peace be upon Israel! And see thy children's children Peace be upon Israel! That was beautiful. A real privilege. Everyone's here, should I invite Rebbetzin Erblich? No, no. The main thing is you are all here. Come, Mother, I made something for you. What? You shouldn't have. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY Someone get a chair for Grandmother. It's Nachum's wedding. This was 20 years ago. Twenty years. Welcome the wunderkind, Zvi Arie Shtisel. I've never seen this. You're so talented. It's nonsense. Should I get you a glass of water? -Mouse catcher. -What? I wanted it, Mother wanted it, the choir conductor wanted it. Only you didn't want it. What are you talking about? I was a good singer. I could've been a soloist. I could have performed all over the world. But you didn't agree. A mouse catcher. That's what I've become. Esti, forgive me again for being late. That's okay. But why did you have to drink so much vodka? It was whiskey. Never mind, I don't know either. It only made me sick. Besides, I'm an artist now. Artists drink a lot, don't they? You didn't tell me what that man wanted. Who, Leib Fuchs? He wanted me to paint for him. That's great. What do you mean, for him? He doesn't know how to paint, he only signs the paintings, so he pays me to paint for him, you see? But it's a secret. I shouldn't even be telling you. I can't believe it. Are you serious? -Like a ghost writer? -Yes. Exactly! Thank you. I'm a ghost painter. Look. You see? You shouldn't have agreed. Instead of using your talent to be a real artist, you're a ghost painter? Who said I want to be a real artist? You can't do this. You're betraying your truth. Why do you think you have any idea what my truth is? Do you really want to know what my truth is? Do you? I'm only looking out for you. -I love you. -I know. Forgive me, Esti, I shouldn't have yelled at you. I drank too much. I'm sorry, Esti, I really am. -I want the best for you, that's all. -I know, I'm sorry. -Call me tomorrow? -Sure. Goodnight, then. Goodnight, Esti. Hello. Mother? Israel? Is anybody home? Hello. Mother? Israel? Is anybody home? Hello. Mother? Israel? Is anybody home?
