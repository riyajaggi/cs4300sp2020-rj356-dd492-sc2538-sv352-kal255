 How are things between you and your widow from the bank? PREVIOUSLY ON SHTISEL -The woman you wanted... -I'm trying, I really am. She seems to want me, but she doesn't want to commit at this time. If you're self-confident, she will start revolving around you. This is for you. Your late wife begged me not to force you to retire. How could she? Twenty years ago, when your father was 70,

 he left the shop and retired. And then what happened? He was no longer himself. My name is Shulem. I worked with your late husband for many years.

I'm listening. This friend of mine is performing tonight, I thought you might want to go. -Performing? -Yes, he... He's in a Klezmer band with some of the guys. They're very good. Are you going? Of course. That's why I offered. It's nice of you to make an offer. Will you come? Maybe it's not right, us going together. First of all, we don't have to go together. You can sit on your own, I'll sit on my own. Besides, it's near the central bus station, not here. -Ultra-orthodox people don't go there. -And you're not ultra-orthodox? Me? I'm ultra-ultra-orthodox. You have nothing to fear. I don't really like places where there are a lot of people. Okay. -But we'll see. -As you wish. -Maybe it'll work out. -All right. Goodbye, then? Goodbye, Elisheva. FILTHY LEAVE OUR CAMP I shouldn't have gone. -Was she upset? -No, I'm just a fool. Will she come? I don't know. She was playing hard to get. -She'll come, you'll see. -Now it's your turn. Fine, but not today. Yes today. We made a deal. -Where is it? -I'm tired, forget about it. Fine, it's forgotten. All right, let's go. We're going? It's in town. We can take the no. 18 bus. -Where is it? -Katamon. -Is she ultra-orthodox? -I have no idea. Do you know her address? I know her ID by heart... -Do you like it? -Yes, it's delicious. -What's it called again? -Lecho. -Lecho? -Lecho. It's not easy cooking new dishes after 40 years in the kitchen. But for you, I'm happy to do it. Thank you. It really is delicious. Oh, it's a quarter to... -The day is nearly over. -Do you have plans for today? Plans? What am I, senile? God forbid. It's just that Eliezer, may he rest in peace, when he retired, he didn't know what to do. He was devastated. But why? Why do you think that the school was my whole life? I have other interests, you know. Many things that you don't know about. All right. Good for you, I'm glad. What is it? Don't you feel well? I'm calling a taxi. You're coming to the hospital with me. You don't have to be here. I want to make sure you're all right. Edna, please, go home before anyone sees us and starts up the rumor mill. Ma'am, you can't be in here during the examination. -Thank you, Doctor. -You can wait in the corridor or in the cafeteria. Your husband is in good hands. Go. All right, I'm going. Eliezer, be well. Call me. -Shulem. Shulem Shtisel. -Forgive me. I'm so sorry. Feel better, Shulem. -Take care. -Call me when you can. Thank you. Doctor, does the fact that I was urgently sent for a CT, mean that my condition is serious? Let's hope not. We're about to start, maybe you'll be more comfortable without the kippah. Must I take it off? Like I said, you might be more comfortable. Careful with your hands. Like this, in back. "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one. Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one. Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one." If this is six, then this must be eight. Bar Nathan? Is that her name? Did you know that the houses are so nice in this area? I imagined some dilapidated apartments with a thousand water boilers. Shall we go in? No, I've seen enough. Don't you want to meet her? You don't have to tell her who you are. What for? Can she restore things to the way they were? It's impossible. Don't you want to see what she looks like? What? We'll wait. Thank you. "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who creates the fruit of the earth." You know, since she passed away, I dream about her. Silly dreams. Last week, I dreamt that I met her on the street. She's holding our laundry tub, full of clothes and pencils. She says to me, all upset: "How can I wash like this? How can I wash like this?" Does it... make a noise? If the batteries are charged, it shouldn't make any noise. How long will I have to keep these wires on? The test takes 48 hours. You can't remove the holter during that time. You go everywhere with it, you go to sleep with it. You can put your shirt back on. Shulem, when you leave here, stop by a stationery store and pick up a small notepad. -A notepad? -Yes. Write down your activities during the day, how you feel, if you feel pressure in your chest, things like that. All my activities? You don't have to go into detail, just in a few words. For example, I went to work, I felt a little pressure, things like that. Come back in 48 hours, I'll remove the holter, we'll compare its data to what you wrote in the notepad and we'll know where we stand. Doctor, tell me the truth, is it life threatening? You believe in God, be patient. If we do discover a problem, you will have to be patient and remain calm. -Do I make myself clear? -Yes, absolutely. Yes. Thank God. Doctor... Don't I need a prescription for the notepad? I see that your spirits are high, you'll be just fine. Kive, are you home? On this, the fourth day of the week... And that ye go not about after your own heart. It is seven o'clock. I just came up the stairs, I am home. I feel fine. Remind Wachsberger about the plans to install an elevator. SEVEN SPECIES -Father. -How are you, Giti? -Thank God. -How are the children? -They're fine, Father. How are you? -Praise God. -Is everyone home? -Ruchami's not back yet. -She's meeting her friends. -Good. How's Lippe? When is he coming back? He doesn't know yet, but thank God, he's very happy. -He's not mad at me, is he? -No, God forbid, Father. That's all in the past. It was for the best. That's right, praise God. And you Giti, how are you? I'm fine, Father, thank God. -Are you sure? -Yes, Father. -Are you all right? -Yes, why are you asking? I don't know, you sound strange. Praise God, I'm fine. Are you sure? Do you want me to come over? No, no. No need. I'm sure you're busy, Giti. I just wanted to ask how you are. Goodbye, Giti. -Goodbye, Father. -Goodbye. The time is 7:15 pm. I spoke to Giti on the phone. She is fine. I feel fine too. Praise God. She's making dinner. I think she's making an omelet, I'm not sure, could be scrambled eggs. You'll be arrested for peeping into people's homes. Shall we go in? We won't tell her who you are. -What will we say then? -We'll think of something. Go look through the window, it'll give you an appetite. I don't want to peek inside like some homeless person. Why homeless? Instead of standing here, you'll just stand over there. What am I even doing here? "Let no disturbing thoughts upset me, no evil dreams nor troubling fantasies. May my bed be complete and whole in Your sight. Grant me light so that I do not sleep the sleep of death. Grant me light so that I do not sleep the sleep of death. Grant me light So that I do not sleep the sleep of death." Honey? Israel? -What? -Help me with this necklace. -Are you going out? -Yes, but not for long. Grandma will be here. Where are you going? It's a secret. -Are you going to meet a man? -A man? Like when you date... to get married. No, of course not. Where then? Out, with a girlfriend. -Wait, you keep moving. -Never mind. Time for bed. Bravo! Levi Itzhak, play "Nu Nu." -Shall we play "Nu Nu?" -Nu, nu. For those of you who don't know this, it's a beautiful song in Yiddish, originally sung by Rabbi Pinhas Segal, fondly known as "Pierre Pinchik," may the memory of the righteous be a blessing. A song about food and people. Our Sages explained This is what They said A human being Is called a man A man and a human There are three types of human beings: One man Another man And another man A man comes home from synagogue And asks Wife Did you prepare borscht? If she says yes He replies, Nu If she says no, He replies, Nu A man Comes home from synagogue And asks Wife Did you prepare meat? If she says yes He replies, Nu If she says no, He replies, Nu Kive? It's midnight. I can't sleep. I feel fine. I don't feel well. My chest feels tight. Every heartbeat feels like a huge hammer. Maybe it's because I'm anxious. "Happy is the man that feareth always." They're out of alcohol. Have some juice. -Cheers? -Cheers. Cheers. I'm spending the Shabbas on Lake Kinneret. -On Shabbas? -Don't tell the guys. I have a small tent. I'll take a book, some cans of tuna, crackers. -Have you done this before? -Many times. -Why don't you come along? -This Shabbas? It'll be a blast. Maybe some other time, on a weekday. Come with me, it'll be nice. -Where will we pray? Eat? -What are you worried about? I'll take care of everything. -Including cholent? -Including cholent. We'll take a hot plate. Don't worry. Okay. Shabbas at Hukok with Shtisel, infinite light! Hukok? The most beautiful beach on Lake Kinneret. On one condition. Do me a favor. Why do you even care? Because you're my friend. Because I can no longer meet my mother. I hope this is a good time. Of course it is. It's always a good time when you come. Good. I passed by the market, the potatoes were on sale. I bought you some. -That's great. Thank you so much. -Great. Thank God, the kids aren't in school yet. They're on their way out. Is Zvi Arye still home? He just returned from prayer services. Thank you. Zvi Arye, your father is here. -Are you all right, Father? -Praise God. The potatoes were on sale at the market so I bought some for you. Thank you, Father, you shouldn't have. Nonsense. What am I, an old man? Velvale, Velvale, come here. Tell your grandfather what you are learning now. -Grandfather! You're here. -Yes, I came to visit. I can't be late for school, Rabbi Safra will get mad at me. Rabbi Safra? Are you afraid of Rabbi Safra? Tell him that your grandfather wanted to ask you what you're studying. Father, how about we come by this afternoon? He was already late last week. The Rabbi said to make it the last time. All right, sweetheart. All right. -You're a good student, right? -Of course, Grandfather. -Don't disturb the lesson, all right? -I never do. Good, good. Go tell your brothers and sisters to come see their grandfather. -Go get them. -Zvi Arye... How are you managing financially? Any better? Thank God, everything's fine. Here, to make things easier. -No, Father, we're fine, thank God. -Take it. -There's no need, Father. -Take it. -We're doing just fine. -Go on. Take it. Put it in your pocket. Here they are, my darlings, the cutest children in the world. Oh, my dear, sweet children, my dear, sweet children. Plan A or plan B? -Remind me, what's A and what's B? -Plan B is Kornblit's charity. Let's start with B. Maybe later I'll switch to A. -Should I knock? -Go ahead. -Hello. -Hello. We're collecting donations for the Mordechai charity fund. It's for orphans. Just a second, please. -Thank you. -My pleasure. May you merit more good deeds. -Yes? -Just one question, if you don't mind. We've been on our feet since this morning and we haven't eaten a thing. Could we... come in for a minute for a little bite to eat? If you don't mind. Gladly, come in, why not? Really? Thank you. You're a life saver. Enjoy. Thank you. Eat up, don't be shy. Are you mad at me? No, not at all. Then why are you acting like this? This whole thing is exhausting. You'll have the entire Shabbes to rest. We are going tomorrow, aren't we? Yes, of course. It'll be a special Shabbes. Here, I'll eat too. Don't you have something else? Some hot food, maybe? I thought that until you get the results of the test, maybe you should eat healthier. Just in case... In case what? You know, just in case... In case what? Tell me. Shulem, what is it? I'm concerned about you, that's all. I didn't ask you to be concerned. I'm sorry. I apologize. -Kive? -In here. Finally. Did you get lost? -No. What is it? Are you all right? -Praise God. -Want me to make dinner? -I already had a bite to eat. -Make for yourself. -I ate too. -Where, at Anshin's? -No... -A family of a friend. -Okay. Why don't we just rent out the kitchen? Are you sure you're all right? I just said, Praise God. What don't you understand? Hook me up to a lie detector. -Here, hook me up to the socket. -All right, forget that I asked. Father... I might be going somewhere this Shabbes. Go wherever you want. Don't worry about me. Here you go. -Aren't you keeping it? -I entered it into the computer. -Should I keep writing? -No need. -What are the results? -The results? Of the device and the tests and the lists I made for you. I have nothing conclusive to tell you, Shulem. You seem to be in good condition, but I want to monitor you, that could take some time. Good condition... Is my life at risk or not? I can't answer that with a yes or a no. I told you last time, you must be patient. Friday. I went to see the doctor. He doesn't know anything. Nothing. I feel that my time is approaching. -One Jerusalem kugel. -Yes? One large cholent. Two gefilte fish, horse radish, two chickens, one large mashed potatoes and pickles too. Pack it up good, Anshin. I'm taking it on a trip. -Bnei Brak? -No. -Where to? -Somewhere. Hello, how are you? Where's Levi Itzhak? On his way? Don't ask. -What? -It's bad, Shtisel. -Levi Itzhak... It's bad. -What? -Don't ask. -Tell me, what's wrong? He cried the entire night. We couldn't sleep. -Where is he? At the apartment? -No. This morning he admitted himself into the psychiatric hospital. Near the cemetery. Where all the loonies are. That's where, Shtisel. -Herzog? -Yes, Herzog hospital. -Why didn't you go with him? -I chased after him, Shtisel. He was crying when he got into the taxi, Levi Itzhak was crying, Shtisel. The taxi drove away. He drove away, Shtisel. Here you go, Shtisel. I'm sorry, he's in a closed ward. He can't have visitors. I just want to see him, I want him to know I was here. I'm sorry. Maybe in a few days, when he's doing better. Excuse me? Can you give him this food? It's for Shabbes. His favorite food. Would that be possible? I'll try. I can't make any promises. Do your best, please. Thank you. Have a good Shabbes. My dear, beloved children, for man knoweth not his time. Since man is constantly on the edge of the abyss, and so you may know which path to take after I am gone, I ask that you bury me in a plot that I purchased next to your mother, my wife, Dvora, may she rest in peace, on the Mount of Rest. As you all know, I gave each of you money to buy an apartment. I now bequeath my apartment in the holy city to my young son, Akiva, may his candle light the way. However, actual ownership of the apartment will only come into effect one year after he gets married. The rest of my property will be divided equally among you. From me, who parts from you with love, your father, Shulem Shtisel. DVORA SHTISEL MAY SHE REST IN PEACE
