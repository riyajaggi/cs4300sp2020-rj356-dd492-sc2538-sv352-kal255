[Bell ringing] Kongo-ho! Hmph! The quiet life. Nothing ever happens around here. No one calls me! No one comes to visit. [Banging] Ahh! [Crashing] That was close! In the name of me great-great-great-grandpappy Kaptain Skurvy... may maggots ravage his rotten remains... Hand over me birthright! Hand over the Crystal Coconut! Skurvy? Kaptain Skurvy, ye dimwitted simian! Ha, ha, har! I"m back! But you"re stranded on a desert island! You"re lost at sea! You... you were chomped by sharks! Aye, but life isn"t all fun and games. Har, har! We"ve come back to get what's rightfully mine. "We"? [Growling] Hand over the coconut, or we"ll chop ya to bits! Yeah, chop him to bits! Chop him to bits! Four bits, six bits! Caw! Easy, easy! What coconut? The Crystal Coconut. Never heard of it. The coconut me great-great-great-grandpappy Skurvy stashed on this island. Sounds to me like you"ve lost your coconut. I"m telling you, never heard of it! Never seen it! I don"t have it. Hoo-ha! Coconut! Did somebody say coconut? Caw! What? That"s not a coconut. Open it, now! But I... I don"t have the coconut, squid-breath! Now, get out of my house! Right this second, or I "ll... I" ll... I... Yes? Oops. [Parrot squawking] Thar she glows! What do you know? How"d that get there? Well, now that we"ve solved that pesky little mystery, I"ll take what"s mine and... Forget it, barnacle bottom! Step back, you can"t have it! Arrr, target practice. Someone call target practice? Donkey Kong! Ha, ha, har! I"ll blow ya out of the water! Ugh! Oh! Arrr, steady as she goes now. Ugh! [Punching, shouting] Abandon ship! [K. Rool chuckling] That"s it! [Giggling] Yes! Oh, splendid orb of power! You little beauty! Soon, you"ll be all mine! Are you comfy, Klump? Um, no. This is a very unconventional way to invade enemy territory. A way that"s sure to cause me pain, Your Majesty! [Chuckling] Better you than me! Yes, sir. Eep! [Explosion] Ahhh! [Crashing] Whoa, ah, whoa! One... more... [Gasping] I got it, I got it! I got the coconut! I got it! [K. Rool laughing] I got it! Brilliant! That was brilliant! [Laughing] KLUMP: Get me out of here! Did you see that? He was airborne! Zip, out of here! With the coconut! You"ve got to get it back now! BLUSTER: Oh, Candy! Yoo-hoo! Candy, Candy, Candy! What do you want, Bluster? Pop quiz: who"s the handsomest, bravest ape in all of Kongo Bongo, hmm? That"s easy. I go out with him! It"s Donkey Kong. Wrong answer, incorrect. Shall I give you a hint? No. I will, anyway. Don"t bother! What? Ah, K. Rool! Oh! What do you want, K. Rool? We are here to seize the factory. I have the coconut! Uh-oh! Mommy! You"re the master! [Kissing feet] The poobah! [Kissing] What"s mine is yours, what"s hers is yours, what"s yours is yours! All of it, yours! Bluster, you spineless worm! [Laughing] Well, my little monkey minion, this is the plan! Reconfigure the factory, manufacture exploding barrels, dozens of them, hundreds of them, thousands! I"ll stockpile so much ammunition, no one will stand in my way! Now, get to work! What, me, work? I never work! Yes, well, I see your point. K. ROOL: More! More exploding barrels! We"ll blast the apes back to the Stone Age! [Laughing] [Explosions] [K. Rool laughing] This is bad, real bad! You got to get that coconut back, pronto! How? I don"t care how! Just get it back! [Explosions] What now? What a weird day. I"m telling you, something's in the air. Barrel bombs! [Explosions] [Bluster groaning] Bomb"s away! Oh! Manual labour. How soul-crushing! How humiliating! [Laughing] Splendid! It"s perfect! Soon, all of Kongo Bongo will be wrapped around my little claw! My beautiful barrels, reduced to smithereens! It"s enough to make a grown ape weep! [Weeping] I can"t destroy another! I can"t! Oh, move out of the way, you snivelling simian! Let me try! Bomb"s away! [Laughing maniacally] Send more down! More, more! [Laughing] Ahem! Oh, wait your turn! [Laughing] DONKEY KONG: It is my turn! BOTH: Donkey Kong! Donkey Kong! Bomb"s away, K. Rool! Yeah, bomb"s away, you pond gack. Easy now, let"s not get too excited, jump to conclusions. We"re just having a bit of fun. Couple of laughs? Yeah, uh, um... Time for you to take a walk, K. Rool. And leave the coconut behind while you"re at it. I don"t think so. This is my command performance! [Explosion] Whoa! [Explosions, rumbling] Quick, to the mine car! Good diversionary tactic, Your Majesty! That way! Over there! ♪ BLUSTER: Oh, Mommy! We got him, little buddy! Banana slamma! Oh, dear! We"ve got company! The enemy"s closing in! Can"t you make this thing go any faster? I"m trying, but we're at maximum speed! We"re gaining on them! Whoa! If we can make it back to the factory, we"re home-free! Oh, dear, this is bad. If we make it to the factory, I"m mincemeat, lizard bait! Oh, yes! A blunderbuss! Hold it right there, pond gacks! Stop this thing and let me go, or I"ll blow you to bits! What? We surrender! Don"t shoot! Bluster? Hey, soldier, look out! Oof! Ahh! Bingo, ha, ha, ha! Whaa-aaa-aah! Lunkhead! Ninny! Newt! You tossed the coconut! B-b-but Your Majesty, we were cornered! Yikes, Donkey Kong!

The coconut? Bluster? I-I-I-I don"t get it! [Knocking loudly] Cranky, open up! Go away! Whatever it is you"re selling, I"m not buying. Get a load of this! We got the coconut! Nope, not buying. [Cranky muttering] Uh, you cold, Cranky? Let"s go inside and I'll put the coconut back in its place. I"m not gonna tell you again! No coconut, scram! Uh, I don"t get it. You tell Diddy and me to get the coconut... Oh, wait a sec! I get it, you need a password. Well, I don"t know the password. I told you, you can"t come in! I know, I know!
