 Anybody seen Marcus? No. Not yet. Seen Marcus? No, I haven't seen him. OK, we need to open up. Are you sure you like it? Love it. Oh, it's exactly what I wanted. Long as you're happy, sweetheart. How does it look now? Hang on! There's Simone! Bye. A kiss? Love you. I love you too.

 Gorgeous. Simone! That's our man right there. So what have we got? I was told possible mass fatalities. Machine gun attack. Two dead. Half a dozen injured. Could have been worse. 20 witnesses, none of whom saw anything. Don't help themselves, do they? Ainsley... You're going to be all right, babe. Ainsley, look, I'm sorry, I tried to get here. Not now, Marcus. Listen. I want the two of you to get out there and find them. I want to know who done this to Helen and to my club! Ainsley, come on! First one here. Head wound. Leo? ..Excuse me.

 'l wish I was with you both#  Have you found any ID on him yet? Not yet. Shot in the back. Any exit wound? I'll see when I do the PM. Keep the injured away from the bodies, please! Can you bag up that paramedic's kit, take it over to Tech? Rachel Tarling. ID from the local FE college. She barely looks old enough to be out. What a mess. What happened? Did somebody diss somebody or glance at their girlfriend so they had to pull a gun, or what? This is about money. Control of the night clubs. Which dealers get in, which don't. Well, hardly looks worth the trouble, does it? Couple of hundred punters five nights a week. 700 per cent of them scoring drugs at least once. Work it out. This is a turf war, Harry. What did the doctor say? Helen's got a bullet next to her heart. Is she going to be all right? She's stable. What's going on? Who's done this? Tery and Marcus are out looking. And then what are you gonna do? See you at the mortuary then, huh? Yeah. I'll probably be able to... DS Ferguson! Hello. We warned the police about this months ago. Told them something like this was going to happen and what did you do? Nothing. Ms Sutherland, I'm doing everything in my power to arrest the people responsible, and if... What're you looking at? I'm not looking at anything. People are dead. Don't you care? If you want to make a complaint, I would talk to a police officer or I would talk to Dl... Don't show your hands. Maybe now you can see why people are scared to come out of their flats at night! This happens! The police are doing the best they can but it's not what I do. Oh, and what is that exactly? I just clean up. Sorry. I'm not a policeman. We have the body of a black male, I estimate in his twenties. So far unidentified. No sign of injury to the front. Can you turn him over, please? There is an apparent gunshot entry wound in the left temporal region. And an apparently corresponding Large exit wound in the right temporal region. There is associated palpable fracturing of the vault of the skull. There is an injury just below the right shoulder blade. 1 30 centimetres from the right heel... Four centimetres to the right of the midlines, consistent with a gunshot entry wound. I'd guess the spine was shattered around the tenth vertebra. Leo. PMs under way? Yeah, I'll... I'll take you through. Have you managed to track down next of kin? Yes. Rachel Tarling's parents thought she was babysitting. They're on their way over here. Is she cleaned up? Because they want to view the body. I couldn't stop them. Why would you want to stop them? They've come to see their daughter! Yeah... Leo, I'm sorry. I should've thought. Cause of death, 1 A gunshot wound to the head. Thanks. What have you got, Harry? The bullet's lodged in the front of the spine. It's actually ended up rather lower than the enty wound would suggest. It's lodged in the second Iumbar vertebra. Damaged the aorta. Inch either side, it would have gone straight through and then he'd probably have survived. But... c'est la vie. Almost got it. Here. Nicely preserved. Commercially produced full metal jacket 9mm bullet, but it was home-assembled. See the circular marking around the tip? What's caused that...is this. It's part of a tool called a gripping die. It's essentially a bullet maker. Now, the component parts of the bullet - the cartridge, the powder, the primer and the shell - they're all legally available on the internet. It only becomes illegal when you assemble them all together, using the gripping die. Now, evey die is unique. And if, as in this case, there's a fault in this part, now that's like a calling card. Well, we'll get it sent over to the lab. I've just come from the lab, that's why I'm here. sorry. OK. 29 cartridges have been found at the scene. Heavy fire. But we shouldn't presume too much from the spread pattern - they might have been knocked all over the place before the area was sealed off so, David, can you get your team over there first thing in the morning? I want to know if this was a random attack or if there was a specific target. Are you a detective? Huh? Are you a detective? No, not quite. I'm a pathologist. Well, what's one of them? It's like a doctor but all my patients are dead. What's the point in that? To try and find out how they died. Do you know what sort of gun it was? None of your bloody business! I heard it was a machine gun. Really? What else have you heard? Nothing. My mum comes here sometimes to the club. If your mum does hear something she should tell the police. Well, she might not really want to call. Why not? Well, just cos, like... Oh, right, OK. What's your name? Harry. What's yours? Wayne. Wayne. OK, Wayne. If your mum does hear something, will you ask her to call me on that number? Forensic pathologist. Yes. Cool. What's your mum's name? Brenda Devlin. And you will ask her, yeah? Dunno. I might do. All right, Wayne. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Pathologist. What have you got? Car abandoned. Stolen yesterday afternoon, matches the description of the car outside the club. Looking like a drive-by shooting. And the cavalry? That's why you're here, there's blood on the seats. We're checking all the units to see if anyone from the car is injured and hiding. We're clear. Take a look at the blood and tell me if anyone from the car is badly wounded. Oi! What are you doing in here? l brought you here to look at the car. It's a drugs den. Or it was. Long gone by the looks of things. Junkies smell. They all do. Look, there ain't nothing here for us! Why'd you have to go grubbing around this shit hole for? Because it's a dead body. You know who's going to be stuck with this don't you? Me. The Armageddon of all street wars is about to break out, and I'm going stuck with a frigging dead junkie! We don't know it's a drug death yet. Yes, I do. I've seen more of these than you've had hot dinners, love! You think we should just leave it here? No. We should catch a gunman, solve a double bloody murder! Now, please take a look at the car. What about the body? Well, it ain't going an_here, is it? Well, what do you think? I don't think the amount of blood here alone is enough to incapacitate someone. But what caused the injury? What does that look like to you? OK, thanks. ..Harry! They've found a bullet in the abandoned car. Embedded in a seat. Right. May? Looks fresh. Mmm. It's too clean to be a ricochet. And it can't have come from the car. Someone fired back. 50, yeah? Yeah. Where is it? Cheers. See you later. Bruv. Yeah... So what you heard? Machine gun. Blew away half the crowd. Awesome. What else? I went up the club to have a look, but the police and everything, it's taped off. You can't see nothing. You hear anything more, you let me know, yeah? Yeah. BASS POUNDS Is that T-Boy? Yeah. Take care, yeah? Yeah. How you going, rude boy? Cool. What, we no done here? Yeah. So what you wait for? Cool and that, man. So, what do you think? She OD'd, she crawled in there? Maybe. It was cold - she was tying to keep warm. Well, if she was tying to keep warm, why would the blanket be underneath her? Look at how the body's positioned. You don't rest like that. Smackhead, she was out of it, she collapsed. And what, then she pulled the hardboard lid down on top of herself? This is taking forever. I just want to wrap it up. Choo, choo, choo choo, ah! DOORKNOCKER CLACKS Choo choo. Open up. There's a good girl. All right? I'm back. You all right? There's a good girl. Do you want the spoon? There you go. Did you get them? Yeah. Well done. BABY GURGLES Oh! different sort. From the same bloke? Yeah. All right then. Mum. I wish you wouldn't. Oh, don't start. If it's the worst thing I can do - I don't think you should go complaining. But you said you'd stop. When I get straight I said. But you never do. It's not easy for me, Wayne. What with Gemma and everything. Oh, you lovely girl! I'll cut down. Promise. OK? Don't really feel anything, most of the time. It's like I'm on autopilot, just going through the motions. How do you feel about the fact you feel like that? I feel I should at least be upset. I'm not even crying. Have you cried? Back when it happened. Not lately? No, not for a couple of months, maybe three. I should be crying, shouldn't l? How do other people react? What you're feeling is absolutely normal. You may find yourself crying in the future and that'll be normal too. I don't care about the work I'm doing. It's pointless. I don't really care about anything. I feel... I feel like one of the bodies in the mortuary fridges. This diagram indicates where people were standing, as far as we can tell from their witness statements. Now, the bullet recovered from the door frame, and the other from the gunman's car, both suggest that someone standing over here... by the entrance to the club, fired off at least two shots... ..back at the car. Who would that have been? Their target. The bouncer. Tery Bannard. Why would they shoot at him? Because he controls the door. The bouncers decide who gets in and who stays out. Meaning drug dealers. Exactly. Well, hang on. Wait until Harry and I have finished the full ballistics report before we can confirm this. Then we should test his hands and clothes for FDRs. Right, Mr Modest. Look, she, she don't look too good. I'm afraid the situation's worsened. There's active bleeding internally which we're still tying to assess. Meaning? Until the situation stabilizes we'd rather not remove the bullet unless...we have to. Look, I want her out of here! l want, I want, I want to go private. I don't care how much it costs. She's too ill to be moved. Look, this is the best place for her. You better make sure she's all right! Do you hear me?! Ainsley. How is she? Worse. We're all thinking of her. Why don't you come over to the centre? We can talk about all this. Talking ain't gonna help. Ainsley, have you been to the police? What for? You think I know who it was? Frankly, yes. Nobody fires a machine gun at a nightclub without a reason. The estate is tearing itself apart - we need to put a stop to all this. Oh, so it's my fault, is it? Huh? I didn't do this. I didn't ask to be shot up. But you were. There were kids who died. You need to take some responsibility. I don't have time for this, I got a club to run. I wondered where you'd got to. Do you want a drink? There's some cold in the fridge. Help yourself. You know where everything is. Cheers, Chris. Did you hear about last night? The shooting. Outside the club. Yeah. Geezer in a car with a machine gun hit a load of them in the queue. Bit of a dodgy place, is it? Well, my mum goes there sometimes. She reckons it's all right. She should know better. Perhaps you should have a talk to her. Oh, I got your gear for you. Oh, well done, mate. There you go. Keep the change. You sure? Course. I'd be stuck without you. Cheers, Chris. ..Thursday, and have to get Regis for the weekend because Liam's giving it some chat about he can't, can't do it or whatever. Your boss about? Who wants him? Got some information for him. Who is he? Don't know. Seen him around. Don't know if he's cool. So, what do you know? There's a guy who wants to do business with you. What kind of business? Stop your place from getting shot up. And in return? He looks after the door. This guy you chat about, him have a name? Not yet. So how I go get hold of him? You give me a call. I'll give him the message. I feel macho already. The MAC 10. Street name - the Big Mac. It's loaded. It's heavy. Yeah. It's popular with gangs and illegal armourers. sorry. Who specialize in reactivating quick firing sub-machine guns. How do you define quick firing? 30 rounds, in three seconds. 30 rounds in three seconds? Yeah. Is it accurate? See for yourself. I want you to try and hit that door. No practice. No tuition. Just like the villains. See how you do. It's a one-handed weapon. OK, in your own time! Go on. Accuracy's not a priority, is it? Listen, mate, the purpose of this weapon is to cause maximum fear and damage in the minimum time. End of story. Can I have another go? This is a decomposed, partially mummified body of a female. My initial assessment is that this is a young adult. Height estimated, 1 75 centimetres. The hair has survived well. Looks brown, but we'll test to see if it's dyed. No external signs of wounds or injuries, probably under-nourished. We'll do a full drugs screen. I wonder what that'll tell us(!) Do you have a problem? What? I said, do you have a problem? Personally, no. Professionally she's keeping me from more important work. Well, surely every life is important. No. Some are more important than others. That's the real world. Is that what you believe? It's the way it is. Says who? Everyone but you. Unless she turns out to be a politician or celebrity. If you're not happy, maybe you shouldn't be on this case. Ask Ferguson to assign another officer. Get him to open another box of detectives. Oh, you're unbelievable. You people really have no idea! What do you mean, ''us people''? Nikki, that is enough! Just get back to work, will you? I'm telling you they won't stop. You've got to make a stand. You're a first class idiot, Tery! You saw what they did, they nearly killed you. We know the man who can fix us up with some firepower. There's a couple of blokes who'll back us up. Look, do the deal, Ainsley, so they have the door. At least we're in business and we're alive. I don't want to go head to head with these guys, you hear me? Maybe you should get out right now. Hang on! If this is about what just happened, I'm sorry but you were running around the room waving a scalpel! I was about to make an incision. Yelling at your SIO. I was challenging his attitude. He has no empathy with the victim. Why would he? He's right! You shouldn't get emotionally involved. This is ridiculous, this has nothing to do with what happened there. I am tying to run a department! Yeah, well, not like you used to run it. Well, maybe things should be different, maybe you should be a bit more professional, instead of mouthing off like some silly schoolgirl. 'l lost my temper with one of my colleagues this morning#  It's like they're always feeling sorry for me. They can't treat me like me, you know, it makes me so angry. Do you feel surprised that you felt angry and lost your temper? I think I was right to lose my temper. I'll do it again if they carry on like that. And you think it's their behaviour that's caused the problems? Yes. Are you absolutely sure about that? Yes. Yes, I am. Well... I'm not pretending that I'm the same. Have you noticed any inherence in your levels of concentration? Possibly. Sometimes people find that they do daft things. They leave the cooker on or they forget to lock the front door. There's emotional arousal inside the brain that stops the cortex, which is the thinking part of the brain. I'm sorry, of course you know all this. But it stops it from working as well as it would, and it's absolutely normal. It's inevitable. But it's the stupid things that other people are doing that make me angry. And if they stop, it'd make your life a lot easier. Well, obviously. Are you doing any stupid things, do you think? Well, my colleagues would say that I was possibly, but that's not the point, is it? Isn't it? Charles Bronson returns. You all right? I'm fine. No, you're not. What is it? Connelly? No, it's not Connelly. I just don't think Leo's dealing with things very well. No. He's got a lot to deal with, so l think we'll have to tread carefully around him and cope with it. I can cope with extra work but not being shouted at and told that I'm completely incapable of my job! Leo shouted at you? He completely humiliated me in front of Connelly! Oh, God. Right, we'll talk to him. An_ay, how was firing your gun? Fun. Hello, mate. Hi. Hiya. Hi. So what's happening with our mystery girl? I retrieved enough soft tissue from her liver for testing. She's positive for morphines, consistent with the use of street heroin. So, how do we identify her? It's possible her DNA is on the national database, but that'll take two weeks. Her hands are too decomposed to fingerprint. No discernable tattoos or distinguishing features. Except for the gap in her teeth. That's quite distinctive. Yeah, right. As if we're going to find her dentist. There might be another way. You've got a visitor. What, Marcus? Modest. Doesn't know which way to jump. Either way there's gonna be some serious arms out. Boom! What's the problem? Tery Bannard. If my man could shoot straight Bannard wouldn't even be a problem, you get me? Oh. What you say, boy? Nothing. Me and Keith are just having this little tigs. No. Here. Now. Now, on the floor. What?! Now, tell me again. Well, I was just saying to Keith it's such a shame how you missed Bannard. Sit down, the boy! You was my man 'pon the inside. Me want things for run nice and smooth, you understand. You are the manager. You can sack Tery Bannard if you want. Modest won't go for that. Him and Tery go back, way back. It no matter. If Modest decide he want for play with we, just tell me. If not, we go back in there and blow the whole crowd away. Let all the brothers know so we mean business. It's all down to you...blood. ..This is the computer model based on the full ballistics report and every other factor we have, and we're 800/o sure? 90. 950/o sure it works. Watch. The car comes in. Gunman in the car starts firing. This is where Tarling and Preston are killed and all the various other gunshot injuries in the queue are sustained. sorry I'm late. I thought we were starting at five o'clock. This is where it gets interesting - when someone fires back. Look at the blue lines. So the person who fires back wasn't on the door. No. It was this person. ..So, what are you saying? She IS going to be all right? Well, we'll operate tonight. You have to understand there is a significant degree of risk with this type of heart surgery. I'm afraid you can't use that in here. Mr Modest... Just take your hand off me! All right. Calm down. Just take it outside, please. Yeah? Yeah? Ainsley, the cops have been here looking for you. They'll probably be looking for you there. Tery, pick up them shooters, yeah, and get your guys in. The cops have got nothing on me, and when I'm out we'll take care of things. OK? You got it. Mr Modest? That's you, ain't it? A long time ago. Who's the bloke with you? He was my best mate. He was with us in the desert when we got shot up. He didn't make it. Is that when you smashed your legs up? Yeah. Billy always was the lucky one. No. No... No... No. No. No. Hang on, go back. Move. Bingo. Well done, Miss Marple. You're Lisa's stepfather? Yeah. Suse and I married when Lisa was about 13, I suppose. She's dead then? What happened? We can't really be certain. Heroin? We found traces of it, yes. You knew she was a user? A user...! I found this. Is it any use? Thank you, it will help us to identify her formally. You sure it's her? We're pretty certain, yes. When did you last see Lisa? Well... Roughly? On her birthday last year. She'd asked us for money but I said no, and then I caught her stealing Suse's mum's jewelry, it wasn't like it was worth anything, just sentimental value. Please, Geom. The final straw, she had to go. I did everything I could. We wanted to help her. Waste of time. So you told her to Leave? You try living with a junkie! Please, Geom! The lying, the abuse, the thieving! She destroyed everything around her. You've no idea what it was like. Tell us who her friends were. Forwarding addresses, anything? There's only Emma. Emma Gardner. You OK? Mmm. Got everything you need? Come on, Wayne. What's the matter? Babysitting's just, you know, boring. Make a change for you, instead of tearing around all over the place all the time. Is Gemma asleep? Yeah. Settled. Just make sure you look in on her every half hour or so. You going to be bringing anyone back this time? Only if he's...really fit. Give us a kiss. See you later. We've got Modest in custody. Can you charge him? No. We can hold him for 24 hours but the CPS aren't happy to proceed unless we can produce the murder weapon. Well, have a look at this. On the left - a bullet fired from the sub-machine gun from the car. On the right a bullet fired back, we think by Modest. Now, you remember those marks that are left on each bullet by the gripping die? Mm-hm. Have a look at that mark on this bullet. Ballistics have established that they're identical and that every single bullet found at the scene has this identical mark, which means they were assembled by the same tool. Which means two different gangs, and two different guns... but only one workshop. Well, well. Your friendly neighbourhood armourer supplying both sides. BABY GRIZZLES Hey. There you go, Gemma. Play with your little toys. Wayne'll go and make you a bottle. Back in a minute. ..Gonna fight. He's told me to make the arrangements. Don't be an idiot, Tery! Think about it, it's crazy. I've made the calls. Got two extra hands coming, and our guy on the estate's gonna kit us out with some MACs. Then that's how it'll be. Right. Poplar Estate, that's right. Thanks. Wayne. Wayne, calm down, listen to me. The ambulance is on its way, keep calm. If there's any change, call. I'll meet you in casualty, OK? I've prescribed a course of antibiotics and it should clear up in a couple of days. The fever's already coming down nicely. Ah. This is very typical of these estates like the Poplar. Essentially - poor hygiene and poor diet. Excuse me. Dr Cunningham? Mmm. If the boy was left alone in charge with Gemma, we should bring Social Services in. No, no, no, no. I can vouch for them. Really. Mum! Wayne! sorry, thanks. What's happened? Gemma just came over all funny. Where have you been? She's going to be OK? She's fine, your daughter just has an ear infection. She's going to be right as rain. Oh, thank God. It wasn't my fault. I rang Dr Cunningham and he fixed an ambulance. Harry Cunningham. I met Wayne the other day. Yeah, I saw you. sorry, hold on one second. Mrs Devlin... sorry, is it MRS Devlin? What? Wayne tells me that he was left alone in charge of Gemma tonight. What bloody business is it of yours? Mum, Harry's just tying to help. If you... But I never normally...! I know I shouldn't have done, but you know it's... Look, shall we go and see Gemma? Come on. Round the corner. You... Come on. OK. sorry. All right? Come on. Well done. ..You said you could deliver Modest. Look I'm tying to... But you said it would be easy. Look, it would have been easy if you didn't go shoot up his woman. Well, wan' for tell me say it's my fault? No, no, no, no look it, I didn't mean... Look, there's something else. I can't be sure but I think...he's getting his shooters from our guy. Let me explain 'ow this work. Me can walk in there and take over him club. Me can do that because me have the weapon, and him have nothing. Now wan' for tell me him have tool as well? Me gon' go head to head with him if me have to, but you gonna be there right beside me. See, look. There they are. I put Gemma on the floor for a minute and when she got sick I thought she'd taken 'em. But I only left her on the floor for a minute. That's all it takes! She could be dead now! Oh, and it would be MY fault, would it? Yes, it would. I can't believe you didn't check the floor before you put her down on it! You stupid boy! I wouldn't have to if you didn't do gear! BABY CRIES DOOR OPENS Wayne! Where are you going? Hey, man. I want a word with you. Actually it's more of a talking to. You been double-dealing. You been double-dealing on me. I'm sorry... I'm sorry. Pretty girl. Where's our prince? Hmm? Where's our Wayne? Well, you wanna mind who you doing business with, you little boy. What, you having a laugh? Huh? You wanna watch your mouth! Yo, man come on now, You don't have to do that, man. Look, we can talk about it, OK?! Just, forget it, OK? Just take it easy, look... Right. The body's already on its way over to the mortuary. We were told it's the manager of the Shed Six nightclub. Marcus Taylor. Modest's right-hand man. Do you think it's the same gang that hit the nightclub before? Too early to say, but I wouldn't be surprised. Things can escalate fast. Found any cartridge cases? Not yet. Well, the killer might have picked them up, or he could have used a revolver. Which would make it a different gun from the ones at Shed Six? Yes. We haven't found any bullets yet. Could be in the body. Right. Right, this is where Taylor was found. Some old lady going to get her newspaper. And guess what? Nobody saw or heard a thing. We've taken pictures. Could be the undertaker trolley when they took the corpse away. No shouting crowds this time. Yes, that's because they're frightened, keeping behind closed doors. They know as well as we do that war's broken out and they don't want to be in the middle of it. PHONE RINGS Yes, Ferguson. She's arrested. It's asystole. Get me a milligram of adrenaline. Call the crash team. '..They got to him' while you had me in here. It's a good thing you were locked up then, isn't it? It could have been you. Have you got any idea who might want to kill Marcus Taylor? It's pretty obvious, isn't it? Is it? Why don't you tell me then? Same dudes as the other night. Who are they, Ainsley? That's your job to find out. Kids get gunned down outside your club. Your manager is murdered, and still you have to play the smart guy?! Yeah, well, smart enough to know you haven't got anything on me. Enough to hold you. Not to charge me. Guv? At least you're out of harm's way. We have what appears to be a gunshot entry wound about here, consistent with this X-ray taken in life, indicating the presence of a bullet lodged in the chest area, here. I'm now removing the surgical stitching. The wound displays a keyhole effect. The shape of it is more irregular than you'd expect on a straightforward bullet entry wound. So what does that tell us? Unstable bullet, perhaps. Or a ricochet. We'll find out, when we've removed this little bugger. Oh, it's definitely a ricochet. Look at the flattening on the side. Now this is a sub-machine gun bullet fired from the car. As you can see, the striations are different. But, if we compare it with the bullet recovered from the wooden door frame at the scene, shot, we think, from the gun fired by Ainsley Modest... perfect match. So Modest sees the car approaching and realises what's going to happen. And he reacts. everything's very heightened, happens very fast, lots of adrenalin. He reaches for his pistol, and he's so keyed up he puts too much pressure on the trigger. He fires the first shot by accident, and it ricochets on the tarmac and hits Helen. He then fires off more shots. He doesn't even realise what he's done. Kills his own girlfriend.
