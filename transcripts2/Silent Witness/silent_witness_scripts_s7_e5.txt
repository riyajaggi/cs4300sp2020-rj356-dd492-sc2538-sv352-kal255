 I can't sleep. You run too hard on your right leg. It hurts. Let me see. No, it's OK... Come on. How's that? That's much better. Thanks. Someone told me once, when the going gets tough, stop. Go easy on that leg. Ohh... Oh... AAA-AAAAGH! Hi, Sam. Don't take your coat off - just got a call. Anything exciting? Throw that away. It's not pleasant. Hi, Leo. Good to see you. How was your holiday? Good. Too good. Pleased to be back? Oh, yeah. MOBILE RINGS Leo Dalton.

 SIRENS WAIL You prepared for this? As I'll ever be. Hey, stop that! Don't do that! Where did that come from? DS Charlie Nicholson. Sam Ryan. Harry Cunningham. It's a selfish way to go. She's a bloody mess. It's a selfish way to go. She's a bloody mess. Does she have a name? Alice Delaney. She worked on the top floor, but she must've jumped off the roof. What makes you say that? All the windows are sealed. How d'you know she jumped? That's why you're here, Professor Ryan, to tell me different. We'll get her moved so you can have a closer look. Why? How long do you think she's been here? No idea. I was hoping YOU could help with that. Was she in work on Friday? Yes, apparently she was. I'm still making enquiries. So she probably died on Saturday or Sunday. These flies will have laid some eggs by now. Should help establish time of death. Careful - it's a bit slippy. Down here. Is there no other way? Not without a boat. Looks like he's been there a while. Pockets reveal anything? No ID, no wallet. He's got a front-door key. So he's a John Doe, then. A what? Who found him? Some kids saw him from that path this morning. Shouldn't they have been at school? What - you'd rather he'd been left here to rot? Why don't you take a wander, Constable Skinner? Listen, this is MY scene. I'M responsible for continuity of evidence. When did you last see Alice? Saturday evening. Saturday? She wanted to talk over contracts. What time was that, Tina? Early. Um...sevenish. Did she often come into the office on a Saturday? Yeah, it was normal for her, coming in at weekends. A bit of a workaholic, huh? I guess so, but...she knew how to enjoy herself too. Smart girl. I thought so. Was she married? She was separated. How long ago was that? Quite a while. That her husband? No. Carlton Johns. She represented him. Did they get on? Course they did - he was her first client. You've got to carry her over the threshold, Carlton. This is a good place to bring up babies. SCREAMING Oh...God! Oh...! Oh! I'm going to check upstairs! SCREAMS Oh, why won't you have children? Mum! Well, she's beautiful, she loves you. What more d'you want? Mum! Well, she's beautiful, she I don't wanna be like Dad and make promises I can't keep. Carlton, you're nothing like your father. That's not entirely true, is it? Anyway, I want some grandchildren. EXCITED SQUEALING GIGGLING Derek, stop it! No! - It's gonna look wicked! - It'll look stupid! Look - they threw in a bed! Fair enough - what YOU paid. You're not happy? Yeah, yeah, it's great. You? Second best day of my life . Hmm. So, are we gonna be using this for more than sleeping? Er... sorry... The championships? Yeah. Before that it was training for the championships. I know. I'll make it up to you, all right? Mmm. Carlton, we gotta scoot. Don't be late. You not coming with us? - No, Malcolm's picking me up. - Oh, right. Well, thanks, Tina, you've been a great help. Doing my job for me? You carry on. I told you, she jumped off the roof. 'Go easy on that leg.' What is it? Nothing. We're gonna check that. What are you doing? I'm examining the scene, and this is part of the scene. Gov, I've checked the server. Anything on the e-mail front? No. Nothing sent or received over the weekend. Great. But, Gov, her car's in the basement car park. She was a top agent, so she got a space. All she needed was this. Cameras? No. Not in the car park. Just like the lobby. Ask around - see if anyone else was here over the weekend. Sir? Can of mace and rape alarm found in her handbag. Yeah. In my day, it was perfume and a spare pair of knickers. I can't see her falling off here by accident. No, she came up here for a reason. Sir. A smoke? Before she killed herself. I'd say the mace and the alarm would suggest a woman who felt very threatened. That's every woman in London, isn't it? Look, you know how hard it is for us in these "push or jump" cases. We rely on you guys to gather the circumstantial evidence. Are you saying you don't trust me to do that? I don't trust you to do anything that's going to make this case last any longer than it has to. That's an outrageous accusation! I spoke to her colleague. Her marriage was over, she was coming into work every weekend, trying to shut out her life, her biological clock was ticking... Her colleague said all that? I've seen it with women. They think they can have it all. When they find out they can't, it's too late. Maybe some women don't want that. I've never met one. Then you've led a sheltered life. Sorry if I've struck a nerve. Harry, the entomologist. Flies lay eggs on dead bodies, eggs grow at a certain rate... How hard can it be to work out her time of death? Different flies, different rates. I know that. You'll need the temperature stats from the Met Office. They're e-mailing them now. Who's a keen boy? DOORBELL Malcolm! How's my little sister? I'm good! And as beautiful as ever. Malcolm! Housewarming present. We've got to be at the stadium for two. Come on, open it. Won't take a minute. It's fantastic! The latest model. I got it in LA. You can't get it here yet. That's really sweet. I know you like everything small and pretty... Not everything! Hey, I don't wanna know! I've got to go, Malcolm. The body is partially skeletonised, suggesting he died months rather than weeks ago. Both hands and arms have been severely torn and lacerated, consistent with the man losing control and tumbling down the bank. Looks like he broke his neck, possibly when he fell. OK. Let's remove the clothes. One brown belt... ..about an inch and a half wide... Oh, that's interesting. These holes are homemade. Could have lost weight before he died. Or the belt could be second-hand? Yeah...that's quite possible. Can I have a shot of those, please? One pair of Endeavour boots, size nine. There's a...rusty mark on the tip of the right boot, otherwise...they look brand new. I was going to buy a pair of those, but I balked at the price. Maybe he was rich. His relatives would already have found him. Perhaps he took walking seriously - that would explain the weight loss. Not that it did him much good. I'll cancel my gym subscription. Empty his pockets, would you? He was a rugby fan. Harlequins v Leeds at the Stoop. What's the date? 3rd May 2002. You're kidding? I was at that match. We sat in the same stand... And shared his boiled sweets? See this building? Bought it last week. It's gonna put Dalston on the map. Restaurant, bar, dance floor, roof terrace. All I need is a project manager. I seem to remember my sister did a diploma in management. I seem to remember she never finished it. She's older and wiser now. Great opportunity for you. Malcolm... Don't give me your answer now. I want you to think about it, OK? Look, I'll talk to Carlton... Forget Carlton! He's useless! This is about you - your future. Just promise me you'll think about it. OK, I promise. Leo, are you done there? Um...I think so. There's been a sudden death on a building site - young guy, aged 25. Can you step out and I'll brief you? Can't Harry see it? What's the problem? I just haven't been able to identify him. Well, ultimately, it's not our job to identify him. We have to show best endeavours. Harry's working with me on the Alice Delaney case. Oh, I see. She warrants two of us, but he's a nobody, so who cares what happens to him? They're waiting for my call. What shall I say? Do I have a choice? The steps which other feet have trod, you tread today. Press onward, upward still, to win your way at last, with better hope and stronger will than ever in the past. Amen. MOBILE RINGS Sorry. Yes? What? Are you sure? Oh, OK. OK, thank you. Right, Carlton, you're on at six. Who was that? Nobody. Nobody? He said it was no-one. Can't I get a straight answer from my own brother? Derek, who was it? Tina, at the agency. What did she say? It's Alice. What about her? She's dead. What? She, um...she killed herself. No. Baby... Where are you going? Carlton? I need some air. What about the race? You've only got a few hours. If it's any consolation, Mr Delaney, everyone acquainted with a suicide victim says the same thing. I wasn't acquainted with her! I was her husband. Acquainted, in love - it makes no difference - they never saw it coming. But suicide... ..that's like ultimate surrender. Alice - she...didn't do surrender. When did she move out? Six months ago this week. Had you seen her since? No. Would you mind telling me where you were over the weekend? I was in Scotland at a wedding - I flew out Friday evening. And when did you last speak to your wife? I don't know... Not for a while. She wanted a clean break. If you don't mind me asking, who is your wife's beneficiary? Well, unless she's changed her will, I am. The body has suffered severe trauma after falling more than 300 feet onto a Perspex surface. Fingernails have been manicured and she's wearing a ring, which is probably platinum, on her left index finger. Can I have a photograph here, please? And bag. There's significant separation of the outer skin from the inner layers suggesting the body is in the medium stage of decomposition. Some inflammation around the nostrils here. Toxicology should be interesting. Very. Let's have some facial photographs here, and empty the pockets. Just cigarettes. Nothing else? Nothing. What were you expecting? Something to light her cigarettes. She walked out, not me. Didn't she give a reason? Lots, but no good ones. You mean there was someone else? She wouldn't admit it, but yeah... ..yeah, I thought so. Why? I dunno. Just had that feeling. She wouldn't go near you, huh? Er... We've all been there, Mr Delaney. She must've finally realised... what it meant to be alone. Would you have had her back? Of course I bloody would! The ribs are really badly crushed - that's due to the fall. However, there is evidence of partially healed ribs on the right. Looks like she's been in a fight. Yes, at least a few weeks ago. The uterus has split and there is... She was in the early stages of pregnancy. OK, let's move her out of here, please. Wait. ..Sam? Mm? Er, what's this? What? This. Small finger-tip bruises on the inside of each arm. She didn't get these from the fall. I agree. Or immediately prior to it. Very unlikely. So these are also older injuries? Suggesting she was... restrained by... someone kneeling on her chest and holding her arms down. Consistent with a sexual assault? You've got this in the bag, OK? Focus, OK? Visualise beyond the line, OK? Harry! Take a look at this. Leo, I am busy. Yes, I know, but I think I might be on to something. Not another John Doe, please. No, no, same one. Look - he'd broken his right leg, but the fracture hadn't completely healed at the time of death... So it happened a couple of months before he died. Yes, but he'd also suffered a major heart attack and that was in the final stages of healing too. So I was thinking maybe the broken leg was a result of the heart attack. Or maybe someone thought he was being a nuisance? Just bear with me, will you? On your marks! I love you, Carlton. Set! Come on, Carlton! Yes! Brilliant! You're here early. Is that a big deal? And now you're off again? That's right. D'you want to tell me where? I don't think I do, actually. Is it anything to do with your John Doe? Sam, I work WITH you, not for you. I think you're confused about that sometimes. Sam? Toxicology on Alice Delaney. Therapeutic levels of paracetamol... and a lot of coke. Strange she was using coke if she was pregnant? She may not have known she was. OK. Still seems a bit odd. Not all women get symptoms. Don't they? Just because I've got a womb, it doesn't make me an expert. No, of course not. Darling...I'm so sorry. The sofa's arrived. Come and look. Cool, isn't it? Yeah. I thought it could go against that wall...or stay in the middle? I don't care where it goes. You don't like it? I'll send it back. No, don't. It's no problem. Why did you miss physio, sweetheart? Why d'you think? Oh, come on. Alice wouldn't want you giving up now. Who said anything about giving up? Carlton, we've all made sacrifices to get here. Don't I know it! This isn't just about you. No! It's about you getting your revenge on Dad, making him regret walking out! Carlton! You stay out of this. You're all desperate to make a name for yourself through me. Well, I ain't having it any more! I want you all out of my face! Darling... All of you! Sam Ryan. Carlton Johns. How's your sleeping? Much better, thank you very much. What can I do for you, Mr Johns? Carlton. Um...Alice Delaney was my agent. I just wanted to say goodbye. I'm afraid that's not going to be possible. Why not? Only family members are allowed to view the body. I'm really sorry. Look, tomorrow I'm representing this country in the European Championships. I know. Well, I wouldn't be there if it wasn't for Alice. I can imagine the strain you're under, but I can't make an exception. You're not going to let me see her? No. I just wanna say goodbye. I HAVE to say goodbye... Please. You could get permission from her husband. Right. Or we can contact him for you, if you like? No... No, it's OK. Look, I'm sorry if I was rude. I'm just used to getting my own way. Good luck for tomorrow. Mr Delaney... SOBS HEAVILY I'm afraid we need you to say it. Yes...it's her. It's Alice. Would you like to be left alone? No. No, you can.... The coroner will release an autopsy report, and, as a spouse, you're entitled to a copy. What, for bedtime reading? I'm sorry. No need. Mr Delaney, it's probably best you know now - your wife was pregnant. Pregnant? In the early stages. I know it must be difficult to lose them both. How... How long? About eight weeks, we think. I'm really sorry. Yeah...me too. And what colour was his hair? Brown. Mm...receding. Mmm. Eyes? What colours have you got? Come on, Leo. Neutral - blue-green. Looks like you - when you were younger. Ha, ha, ha(!) You did good the other day, a nice steady run. But your start wasn't all it could have been. I know. You moved up rather than forward - it took you five metres to catch up. I said I know! I can't do this. You're gonna have to tell her. What? Tell Kimberley about you and Alice. Is that supposed to be funny? Look, you're living a lie and it's dragging you down. She'd leave me. That's what you wanted yesterday! I know. Kimberley doesn't deserve to be second best, Carlton. If you don't love her... I never said I didn't love her! Look, she'll thank you for it in the end. You mean she'll be freed up for YOU? So you're saying you think Alice Delaney was sexually assaulted? Bruising on the upper arms, pressure to the chest - adds up to a familiar pattern. She doesn't quite fit your profile as a depressive workaholic. In what way? She'd had silicone implants, her hands were manicured, she was wearing a brand-new platinum ring. Presents to herself - they didn't work. She was also eight weeks' pregnant. Was THAT a present to herself? She hadn't stopped smoking, so she probably didn't know. Delaney said he hadn't seen her for six months. She could have had another lover. There's no law against that. What about the missing lighter? Who said it's missing? Have you searched her flat yet? No. Not yet. Let's go. You thought any more about coming to work for me? I have. Sorry, Mal. Is that your last word? Yeah. So you're gonna hang around here the rest of your life, watching TV and cutting Carlton's picture out the paper? Malcolm... You're 22 years old! I'm happy, Mal. I wish you were happy for me. You sound like you're trying to convince yourself. No. OK, just tell me this. Why haven't you got any kids? You've been together for years. Carlton's sensitive about kids. His dad walked out on the day he was born. Sensitive?! He's waiting for something better to come along. Oh, come on! He always has been. I'm not listening. Why d'you think he's so upset about Alice? You think he's worried about his sponsorship deal going tits up? Get out. He'd been seeing her for months. Is everything OK? Kim, you had to know. Goodbye, Malcolm. We need to talk. Not now. Yes, but when, Malcolm? I'll have a look downstairs. How long are you going to be? Difficult to say. What you looking for? I don't know yet. Star client? Yeah. It's my job to look after him now. Are you worried about that? I don't take my work home with me. So you won't have one of these on your bedside table? What was Alice like to work for? She was great. She gave me my break. I didn't have much experience, but she said enthusiasm was enough. Were Alice and Carlton having an affair? No. If you're telling me that out of loyalty, it's misplaced. Alice is dead. I'm sorry, I've got to get back. Well, we haven't finished here. I've got a spare, you can keep this. I need to know if Carlton Johns was the father of Alice's baby. Not without his DNA. We can test the father's ethnic origin. I'll get Harry onto it straightaway. I found a box of condoms by her bed, so maybe it wasn't planned. Yo! Your brother did wicked in his race, innit?! Is Malcolm in? He's, er...busy. I didn't ask if he was, er...busy. PRESSES A BUZZER Guys.... Sam, I got the results back on that ethnic inferencing. The father of Alice's baby was Caucasian and the baby was conceived eight weeks before she died. Right. I could test Philip Delaney's DNA - if we can get some. Thanks, Harry. Leave it with me. Well, as far as we know, Philip and Carlton were the only men in her life. Why would Philip lie about seeing his own wife? Because they had sex. There's no law against having sex. Not unless she didn't want to and he insisted. Oh. Well, we'd better go and see him. It's all there. Cheers. Later. Alice Delaney... ..what happened? You tell me. I tell you about her and Carlton, and three weeks later she's dead. I had nothing to do with it. Really? I don't believe you. Why d'you care? You got what you wanted. That's NOT what I wanted! Why did you come to me if you thought I wouldn't do something about it? ..You're pathetic, Derek. I hope Carlton does get himself a new coach - a real one. What d'you mean, a real one? Why don't you coach anyone else? I'm too busy. Who are you kidding? No, really... No, no, it's true. You're a loser, Derek. Carlton feels sorry for you. That's the only reason you're doing what you're doing - everyone knows it. You really thought I'd taken care of that woman so YOU could stay Carlton's coach? No. You did it for Kimberley. Don't you ever mention my sister's name. I see the way you look at her. Are you saying she was murdered? No. When people fall to their death it's something we look at. If it's OK, we'd like to take a DNA sample from you. What do you mean? It's a simple mouth swab - for purposes of elimination only. No. You won't let us take your DNA? No. So if you don't mind leaving me alone... Mr Delaney, non-cooperation can give the wrong impression. Sorry, could I use the bathroom before I go? Upstairs, on the right. Thank you. It doesn't involve much... I'm guilty of nothing. The last time I saw her... we spent the afternoon planning. Planning what? What we were going to do together. As a couple? Yeah, she was really excited. We were going to give it a few weeks, wait till the championships were over... then tell my family. So the last time you saw Alice, she wasn't depressed or upset in any way? No. Definitely not. We had the future to look forward to. Then the idea of suicide... Rubbish. There is no way she would have taken her own life. She smoked, didn't she? Yeah. I kept trying to persuade her to quit. Did she use a lighter? Yes. I didn't really help by buying her one. You bought her a lighter? I had it engraved. They didn't find it amongst her possessions on the roof. They must have done. She carried it with her all the time. They didn't. Then, someone's taken it. TV COMMENTARY: 'And that was the women's 400 metres recorded earlier. 'We're waiting for the men's 100m final, which hopefully will go ahead 'upon the arrival of Great Britain's Carlton Johns.' Any luck? No. What's he playing at? Nothing. So where is he, then? I don't know. It's your job to make sure he gets here! But, Mum... You should have told me. About that dead bitch. I couldn't. Look, he lost it. Kimberley, wait! I was just trying to help. Who? Who, Derek? Everybody. Sam... Hang on a minute. 'The 100m final has taken place WITHOUT Britain's Carlton Johns. 'A big disappointment for all his supporters. He will automatically be disqualified. 'And no-one seems to have any explanation for his disappearance. 'A sad day for this country's most talented athlete...' Sam? Carlton?
