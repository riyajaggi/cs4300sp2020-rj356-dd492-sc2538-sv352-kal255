 Get away from me! Stay away from me! This has got to stop! Fact - May '96, a rapist is convicted on DNA evidence despite his victim saying the man is NOT her attacker. Fact - December '97, a forensic laboratory admits to using second-hand equipment which has not been tested for contamination in six years. Physical evidence can be fallible. None of us should ever forget that. Thank you. Dangerous ground, Sam. Maybe. A profession thrown into confusion because of newspaper articles? Mistakes have been made. Do you intend to say this at the Memorial Lecture? Are you wishing you hadn't asked me?

 I've never misjudged a student yet. Am I still a student to you, Leon? ..Excuse me. James, what are you doing here? Curiosity. I didn't expect you to show up. Ever? So soon. I couldn't stay away. TRAD JAZZ PLAYS RINGS BELL There are certain things in life that are sacred. I hope this won't be embarrassing. There's work. Absolutely. I might have guessed. And... What? Relationships. Some. And that's it? No, no, there's friends. Friends. Friends. Friends. And having fun. May Ball's are notorious. Notorious for what, is the question? For the amnesia they cause the following morning.

 Oh! There. ..It's all right. White wine, I'm told... It doesn't matter. Move your bag. Oh, let me get my mouth under it! I'm sorry. I'll have the dress cleaned. Oh, it's old. Well, you've got a clean driving licence at any rate. So, where does James come from? That training course I went on - road accidents. He's a traffic warden! He's a consultant in orthopaedics. He can manipulate MY bones any time. He's gorgeous! He's all right. Bring him to dinner. You haven't seen our new place. Very sexy. It's become somewhat of a tradition. I've worn them to the May Ball ever since... The first time with Martin. Well, no wonder he doesn't want to miss the ball. I didn't want to come without him this time, but he insisted. Get out! Don't start that again. I'm not going anywhere. You're a drunk! This isn't drunk! We'll talk about it tomorrow. All right. I'm going. I'm sorry, everybody. I'm very sorry. Professor, have you come to join the party? Dr Evans! Remember you promised me a dance later? How could I forget? CONVERSATION DROWNED OUT BY JAZZ Professor Foreman, I recommend the tequila slammers. They do nothing for the intellect. After a few, you think they do. Not a philosophy to take with you into life, Mr Arnold. Have you tried the Bucking Bronco, Dr Ryan? In this?! Go on, give us all a thrill. You're easily pleased. Four tequila slammers, please! Dr Evans, what a pleasant surprise. Er... Can you come with me, please? Er... No "buts". This way, please. How long are you staying? I've got to go at four. Don't worry if you want to leave earlier. Have you seen enough yet? Why, have you got other things on your mind? Mmm. So what do you think? Your place or mine? Neither. Come on. MUSIC: "Alright" by Supergrass A first. ..A first! A fu...! Language! I'm sorry, sir. But I did it! I know, and Miss Thomas also. Yes. And Mr Electronics, a double first. And next time you attempt to be John Wayne, try holding on to that Bucking Bronco. It'll save your face. Enjoy what you have, hope for what you lack. Good drive? All right. Just over an hour. Did you have a nice time? No. Nothing to do but go for walks. I'll collect them tomorrow. Can't I come with you? No. Now, behave for Gran. Bye. Bye-bye. I thought it was about time you met the family. The family? Yeah. Does this mean you're getting serious? Would you like that? I quite like the idea of your being around every day...every hour. What are you saying, James? So, who am I going to meet? I thought your sister had moved back to Ireland. She has. Trevor Stewart?! Do you know him? He's not your family! No, he's my business partner. BEEP 'Professor, this is Annabelle Evans. Can't make meeting. 'Had to go away for the week. 'Sorry.' BEEP Annabelle! So how long have you two known each other? Two, three years. You never said. Didn't I? We met on some hospital committee. James would always arrive late. On purpose, to avoid the boring bits. I thought it was because you liked making an entrance. How's Jenny? Expensive. They're divorced. Annie? Dinner. I don't think I can. Come on, Trevor. No...BEEP Sorry, boys, I'm going to have to leave you to it. See you tomorrow, Trevor.  Sure. So, it's just the two of us, then? Dr Ryan? That's right. She's upstairs. Husband came home and found her. Nobody's moved her. First on the scene was a young uniform. SOPOs were here in 30 minutes. It's possible the assault started downstairs. Are you the new DI? No, I am. Mike O'Connor. Sam Ryan. I hope we're not spoiling your evening. No, of course not. Hi, are you ready to take photographs? Yes, love. There is a deep wound to the left side of her head, which could be the cause of death. Any idea how long she's been dead? No, I'll need to do a body temperature. There are no other obvious signs of injuries. I need to get something from my car. I'll send someone. No, I'll go myself. She knows her. Why didn't she hear the window break? TV was on. Loud? Loud enough. Goes into the living room... Did you get what you needed? Yes. ..She runs out of the living room and up the stairs. Why not to the front door? Well, maybe there was a second assailant. Yeah, could've been. She runs up the stairs, still being chased. She heads for the bedroom. He corners her in here and he thwacks her with something. We're not sure what. Her injuries suggest she could have turned and looked at her attacker. So, it's a burglary gone wrong, we think. That's what it looks like to me. Mmm... I'm not so sure. Why chase and kill her? Why not just leave? Maybe she knew her attacker. Maybe. TV ON Hello, Sam. How was it? A murder. Really? It was Annabelle Evans. We had supper with her the other night. What? I've just got to go and have a shower. That must have been a helluva shock. It was. Do you know what happened? It might have been a burglary. And was she, er...? I don't think so. We won't know, though, till we do an autopsy. Are you all right? Yeah. I just didn't want anyone else touching her body. Perhaps I'd better go. I'll give you a ring in the morning...when you're feeling better. 'To say forensic pathology is an absolute science would be rather like saying' the universe ends at the Milky Way. Pathology is on a constant learning curve. We learn by our mistakes... I dropped the children off at my mother's and then went to the house. ..Must not repeat them. She was just lying there. 'This is Annabelle Evans. Can't make meeting. 'Had to go away for the week. Sorry.' You're in luck. I don't get many messages. ..And not taking into account the post-mortem changes. I didn't really know her. We just went on the waltzers. We're tracing Dr Evan's movements after the ball. Can I have a word? Yeah. Over 40 years ago, Dr Alan Morris published a paper entitled Classic Mistakes In Forensic Pathology. He listed 14 mistakes. Firstly, that a decomposed or mutilated body is still acceptable for an autopsy. Any idea what time that was? 1.32. She was dancing. That was the last time you saw her? Yeah. Did you like her? I mean, as a person. Tutors are all the same. What does that mean? They think they have the upper hand. Thanks. Thanks for the coffee. What was your name again? Bradley. DS Bradley. And what if I wanted to get hold of you? You think you might have some more information? No. I might just want to get hold of you. 'Lastly, one of the most overlooked mistakes of all - talking too much, too soon or to the wrong people.' Be confident within yourself before you commit your thoughts to other people, and if you're unsure, then say nothing. The body and the scene of the crime, if you look closely enough, will give you the answers. If they don't, then maybe something's clouding your judgement. There'll be no questions. APPLAUSE We have a female, late 30s, Caucasian. The body feels incredibly cold. A deep laceration to the left side of the forehead. ..Thanks, Fred. The wound measures...3.4 inches... centimetres... 3.4 centimetres in length. And...2.6 centimetres in width. Excuse me, Dr Ryan, can I have a word? Yes? Do you think you should carry on with this? Why? Er... You know the deceased, don't you? Because if you do, and you continue, isn't it possible you could jeopardise any case we might have? Trevor, can you take over from me, please? Would you excuse me for a moment? Sam! I'm going home. What the hell is going on? Not now. Yes, now. Why didn't you tell me? Don't you trust me? It's not that. Well, what is it?! I owed it to her. She was my friend. So what am I? The laceration was possibly caused by a solid object. Any idea what? Not at the moment, no. A set of markings could have been caused by a raised feature of the object. Looks like lettering, maybe a letter B. I'll get it. Thank you. Did you forget this time? No. I take it we won't be going out this evening. We had tickets to the theatre. I'll put you to bed. You could still make it. Don't be like that. Like what?! Just go, James. SOCOs have turned up nothing - no fingerprints, shoe prints, fibres. Do we know what was stolen? ã170 in cash and some jewellery. Hardly worth losing your life for. 137 interviews... A phone message from her home two days before her body was discovered. More degrees than a thermometer. And what have we come up with? Sweet FA. So... ..we're going to do it all again. We need to find out where she was between the night of the May Ball and the night of her death. Somebody has got to know. CHOIR SINGS: "Jerusalem" Please sit down. I'd like to thank you all for coming to this memorial service. Annabelle would have been deeply touched to see so many friends and colleagues here today. This is, of course, a sad occasion and there's absolutely nothing that I or anybody else can say to make it any easier. Thank you, Father. Dr Ryan, I'd like to offer my condolences. Thank you. If we could talk when you're next at the office... Friend or foe? I'm not quite sure at the moment. A little drink? My rooms. In honour of Annabelle. That sounds a lovely idea. Professor Foreman. Mr Arnold. Sir, I need to talk to you about next year. Your PhD? Yes. Now Dr Evans has gone... Unfortunate timing for you. Very, but if I can... Later, Mr Arnold. There is a time and a place. Of course. I was in your lecture the other day. I went and got Dr Morris's paper. Did you find it useful? In a fundamentalist way. Oh? 1956, I believe the paper was first published. We have moved on since then. Architecture has moved on since Wren designed St Paul's. It doesn't mean it's without merit. BELLS RING Hey! Remember me? I don't want to fight with you, not again. Do something! She was on the bed. Fallen there. Her body slightly awkward. I'd seen it so many times before. And up until the moment when I saw her face - recognised her... ..I was excited. I was doing what I want to do. And then what? Nothing seemed to make sense. I wasn't thinking clearly. Have you forgotten what I taught you? No. I... I just felt I was failing her. Always return to the fundamentals. The answers are with the body and the scene of the crime. I know. It's one of the first things you ever said to me. But what are the answers? I couldn't see any answers. Ours is not a science of emotions but of debatable facts. I thought you above all people understood this. Remember, the pathologist is not totally dissimilar to the murderer. The more detached he or she is, the more successful they will be. I know. I KNOW. Emotion leads to mistakes. It clouds the judgement, as you yourself said. I never thought I'd hear you quote me. I quote only the best. See this as a challenge, Sam. I've heard how you overstepped the mark. Who told you? Oh, that's not important. What is important is whether you can rise to the occasion now. You were my brightest student. Look on this as the ultimate examination. I shall mark you, from afar. DISTANT BELL RINGS We met in a restaurant before the ball. A Marco Rossi spilt wine on Annabelle. Did he tell you he was sacked? It wouldn't have worried him. The restaurant's owned by his brother. So he's not a suspect? He's one of a number. After leaving Capriccios you went to the ball. All four of you? Yeah. You stayed together all evening? No, we left at 2.30, Dr Reynolds and I. And Annabelle said she was leaving at four. Did she say why? No. There's a train at 5.20 from Cambridge to Peterborough. She could have gone to see her husband. Are you saying you think he's responsible? I can't rule him out. No, not Martin. Thank you very much, Dr Ryan. You've been very helpful. Hi. Hi. What's that? ..The Annabelle Evans case. Sam... I should have said something. I'm sorry. I was about to say I understand how you felt. I'd have wanted to do the same. So what do we know? The head injury wasn't the cause of death. I believe she was suffocated after being hit. No signs of any other assault. At the moment, I can't give a time of death. Approximation? Nothing. Any explanation why the body was so cold? No. Could she have been kept somewhere, which is why it's difficult to give a time of death? Could be. There are no signs of freezer burns. Do you want to check with SOCO? Right. I'd like to start from when you went away with the children. What would you like me to say? Where you stayed, how long for, why. We're waiting for a blood match. Some of it may be the killer's. You never know. There was also blood on the INSIDE of the nightdress. It soaked through? No, it didn't. It doesn't correspond with blood marks on the outside. If it had been put on after the blow, that would explain it. You wouldn't normally hit somebody then dress them. I've seen cases the other way round, though. The other odd thing is the amount of blood on the sheets and mattress. You'd expect more from a head wound. Yes, they normally bleed like a stuck pig - much more than this. But that's really just my opinion. You couldn't use it in court. Anything else? Only the abrasions on the heels. She had a lot of hard skin. We found some fibres there. What sort? Tights. Could be stockings. Hard to say. But I would hazard a guess that she was clothed when knocked unconscious. You've heard what SOCOs have turned up? I've read the reports. Blood on the inside of her nightdress. Yeah. Smeared on when it was pulled over her head. That figures. And there are fibres of stockings or tights on the abrasions on her heels. It all adds up to the fact she was fully clothed when first assaulted. She was dragged over a hard surface, clothes removed, nightdress put on, then placed on her bed. So someone WAS trying to make it look like a burglary. Yeah. It's likely she was killed elsewhere. We checked her cottage. No evidence to place her there. She'd have told me if she'd been going there. But I'm still going to keep an open mind about the husband. Dr Ryan. Yes? You were very close to Annabelle. What else do you know? How do you mean? What were her secrets? She didn't have any. Annabelle had what most of us want - good career, nice home life. Is that what YOU want? How do you know I haven't got it? I don't. Just theory and supposition. Break the habit, Marco. Do us all a favour. It was THEM. It always is. Just try and stay out of trouble! We'll have some sparkling water as well. Yes, of course, sir. So, is this a romantic dinner or a Crimewatch reconstruction? A bit of both. I needed to come here again, and I felt I owed you one. Owed me? I haven't been at my best. That's understandable. And I'm sorry about the theatre. No problem. Did you go, then? Yeah. Alone? Would you object if I hadn't? No, of course not. You didn't miss anything. It wasn't very good? Yeah, the play was great. I don't recommend supper by yourself. You're trying to make me feel worse. Yes. Then you'll be more compliant when I get you home. I wouldn't bank on it. That's all you're getting. What?! If you don't work, I'm not going to pay you. All right. I'll work now. I don't want you to. Why not? You can come in tomorrow, but if you've been drinking, or you mess up once, that's it! No more! That's your brother, isn't it? Yes, that's right. Has he always worked here? Only in the last year. What was he doing before? Playing at being a student. - Where? - Here in Cambridge. He was sent down at the end of his first year. He was never going to make the grade. Was Dr Evans his tutor at any point? ..No. No, she wasn't. So, she had no contact with him. Oh, yes, she did have contact with him. If she wasn't his tutor... He did become rather infamous, did Mr Rossi. How? After he was sent down, he wrote to every Fellow at the college demanding that he be given another chance. You can imagine how that went down. Yeah. And it was decided that one letter should be sent back on behalf of all the Fellows. That letter was signed by Dr Evans, as academic staff representative at the time. But she might not have known him personally? I wouldn't think so. Sergeant Bradley. Have a nice evening, did you? I was just having a quiet drink. With a potential witness in a murder case. Hardly a witness. We don't know when Annabelle was murdered. Louise could have been one of the last people to see her alive. I'll deal with that when it happens. I don't think your boss would be too pleased with you. Thinking of telling him? Not necessarily. What do you want? Marco Rossi. He was a student sent down from Cambridge. He refused to leave. Annabelle had to write to him giving him the college's final decision. So? Before the May Ball, he was thrown out his brother's restaurant for spilling wine down her dress. Because she wrote this letter? No, I don't think so, but maybe he realised who she was. He saw her driving licence. Later on, on the way back from the ball, I saw him... with blood all over his face. Where do you think he'd been? You think he followed her and killed her. It's a possibility. We're pursuing other avenues at the moment. I saw him! I was there! Now, I think you should follow it up - speak to him again, see what he has to say for himself. It's true what they say about you. Don't take any prisoners, do you? Not when it's my friend on the slab. He took me for a drink. That's all. It better be. Jealous, are you? Maybe. You two staying on for a bit? I think you'll find you are as well. Why? The police are going to interview everyone who was at the ball...again. SIMON: Worried are you, Eden? Why should I be? KNOCK AT DOOR Martin. Hi. I hope you don't mind me popping round like this. No, no. Where are the children? Home, asleep. It's just a quick visit. Come on in. The police questioned me. I thought you already gave a statement. They wanted to clear up a few things. Would you like a drink? Please. Sam, there's something I didn't ask the police, but I... What? Was there any sign of...intercourse? I need to know. No, there was no evidence of it. Good. Just needed to know. When was the last time you spoke to Annabelle? When we left for the cottage. I tried to ring, but I got no reply. How are the children? Is there anything I can do? No, they're fine. They're used to it. Used to what? Me looking after them. Annie was always... ..busy with other things. What things? Oh, I don't know. You know... Being a friend to everybody. What do you mean? Nothing. I don't understand. ..No. Nobody does. Nobody understands what I've been through. What do you mean? You don't want to know! I do want to know. If I hadn't gone away, this wouldn't have happened. But it wasn't my fault. It was hers. She made you go away? She'd still be alive! As it is we have this...mess, this bloody mess, and I don't know what to do! Oh, look, I better go back. Martin! If you're in some kind of trouble, you should talk to the police. No. I need to think of the kids. MUSIC: "Creep" by Radiohead CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS ♪ ..like an angel Your skin makes me cry ♪ You float like a feather... ♪ Better late than never. I don't suppose we have a weapon? No, sir. Or whether he tried to suffocate this one? No. What about Marco Rossi? Do we bring him in? On what grounds? He's got a grudge against students. So have I. He's got a grudge against anything to do with the university. Let's just stick with our original thought. The husband? Maybe. Maybe he was having an affair with Louise. She finds out about Annabelle. He decides to shut her up. Get a pathologist to look at the girl's wound. If it was the same person using the same weapon, I want to know. PHONE RINGS Hello. Yeah, OK. I'll be there as soon as I can. Who's that? Trevor. Oh! A student's been attacked. Same MO as Annabelle's murder. They're dead? They're still alive. So why are you going? To find out what I can. It's 7am! This isn't orthopaedics - you don't make an appointment. Will she be all right? Yes. She took a nasty blow to the head. No attempt to suffocate her? Apparently not. A cushion was found on the floor next to her. Same type of head wound? I'd say so. You haven't heard the best bit yet. We might have DNA. How are you feeling? Terrible. Do you remember what happened? No. We'll get whoever did this. You scratched him with your nails. If it's his face, he'll need plastic surgery. KNOCKING Thank God you're all right. So... is it business or pleasure this time? It's not a pleasure seeing her like this. I'll ring you when we get something. Your mates have given us a lot to go on. Take care of her. I'd say they're pretty much alike. The markings are similar to those around Annabelle's wound. The indentations, could they be made by a bottle? Possibly. But there wasn't any glass found. The break-in's the same, the attack's similar, the amount stolen? ã80. It doesn't warrant this type of assault. If the idea was an identical crime, why kill Annabelle and not Louise? Daddy! How far was the drive from the cottage to your home? 60-70 miles. At speed - an hour? Yes. So if you put your kids to bed at 9, 10, that's what you said, isn't it? You could have checked they were asleep, driven home, spent 15-20 minutes there, and returned without your children knowing you'd gone. I wouldn't leave my children. You did last night. Were you having me watched? You left them at about 7 o'clock. The officer wasn't sure where you went. To see a friend. Who? Dr Sam Ryan. Then where did you go? 'The police have been questioning her husband.' An obvious move. You don't think he did it? No. So who do you think is responsible? The waiter. But... You're not sure? No. Why consider him in the first place? The sacking. He saw her address. He could easily have overheard us mentioning that Martin was away. I saw him later with blood on him. And now there's the business about him being sent down. Go back to the body. Go back to what is certain. Why didn't you want your children to see your wife? I did. You left them at your mother's. Because we needed to talk. Or... because you didn't want them to walk in on her body? No. What did you want to talk about? Us. About us. Our life. And you couldn't do that with the children in the house? No. Why not? Be... I couldn't. Do you know Louise Thomas? Who? She was a student of your wife's. I don't know her. Never heard the name? No. She had an almost identical attack to the one your wife suffered. I don't know who she is. You tried to stop Louise talking about your affair. My affair?! Stop it becoming public knowledge. If it got out, the motive for killing your wife will be obvious - she'd found out about the affair. There's no affair. I don't know her. You hit her with the same object. No. And left her for dead. I never went near her! You did. I didn't. You did. No! I put it to you... you killed your wife because she found out you were having an affair. Oh, for God's sake, man! It wasn't me... Annabelle was having the affair. Who was she seeing? I don't know. Come on, Mr Evans! I don't know. You expect me to believe that? I can't win with you, can I? Mr Evans, we'd like to carry out a blood test for a DNA trace. SOLICITOR WHISPERS No, no. Do what you like. Take a look at this. Do you see it? Rampant ortolosis. Consistent with the fact the body could have been frozen. I see what you mean. The damage to the cells isn't marked. How often do you see that much change in someone just dead? The body was subject to severe temperature changes. I think it was frozen, or stored somewhere cold. It's not impossible. So the question is, why would anyone wish to do this? The murderer wanted to store it? Didn't want it to start to smell. Why store a body? Once it's dead, it's dead. Was the murderer hoping to conceal it for ever? If so, why not try to destroy it in some way? This doesn't seem to be the case. So the purpose of freezing the body was what? To confuse you! And they've succeeded. Yes. Yes. Now, an important question. Is the young waiter clever enough to confuse you? BANGING ON DOOR Marco! Police! Come on, Marco! All right, all right. So what are you going to do now? Go to the police. Tell them what I know. KNOCKING Oh, Mr Arnold. I was expecting you to cancel after what happened. She's going to be all right, and I thought it was important I saw you. Very important. Urgent, wouldn't you say? Yes, sir. It's a shame Dr Ryan doesn't dabble in genetics, or she could take you on. Mr Arnold was going to do his PhD under Dr Evans' guidance. Really? Now I'm not sure where I can place him. It shouldn't be that difficult. I did get a First. You SCRAPED a First, Mr Arnold. My students don't scrape Firsts, they glory in them. Dr Ryan, for example. Oh, I probably wouldn't manage a Third now. She's too modest. She was brilliant. You could learn a lot from Dr Ryan. But unfortunately, as you said, I don't deal in genetics. Thanks for your time. Professor Foreman. If Dr Evans had still been alive, my future wouldn't be in doubt. There must be another don... One second, Mr Arnold. Before we discuss your academic capabilities...or lack of them, as the case may be, I should like you to tell me about what happened last night. With respect, I don't think last night has anything to do... I would like to know how you found Miss Thomas, what the police asked you, and what you yourself deduce from the incident. Why? I need to know how clever you are. I need to know what I'm recommending. The murder could've happened three or four days earlier. Two, max. No, it was longer. It takes time for a body to defrost. She left a message on Foreman's answer machine two days before. Are you sure? We have the tape. It's authentic. The phone company verified that a call was made from her house then. I'd have thought it would be longer. Did you run a voice check on the tape? Yes. There are plenty of recordings of her lectures to compare it to. Two days just doesn't make sense. Maybe her husband will tell us. DS Bradley tells me you have another theory - the ex-student, Marco Rossi. Not any longer. Somebody told me you had an infallibility problem. They were obviously wrong. Obviously. I have to say, I don't like pathologists trying to blackmail my staff. DS Bradley told me what happened. KNOCK ON DOOR I'd have thought you'd have known better. Ah, come in. We were talking about you. Sergeant. DS Bradley was working on my instructions. He was getting information about Annabelle Evans' friends. Because of his work, which meant taking Louise Thomas out, we discovered that Dr Evans had had various relationships. Relationships? Quite a number, apparently. Relationships? Quite a number, apparently. What? Didn't you know? No. Well, her husband did. He knew all about it. If you'll excuse me. Do anything like that again and you and I will be parting company. Next time a Mensa bimbo comes onto you, use her brains, not anything else. Sam. Have you got a minute? Yeah. I hope this isn't more bad news. I've had as much as I can take. Let's start with the scratch marks. How did you get them, Marco? Somebody just scratched me. For no reason? Yeah. It's not the first time... as you know. I don't know. I'm new here. Tell me. It happens all the time. The students have a thing against me. Why? You tell me. You used to be a student. So? What happened? I got sent down. Why? For being normal. For not being bloody perfect. I wasn't exceptional enough for them. Or so they like to think. Did you know Annabelle Evans? Yeah. I knew her. But she didn't know me. She was never one of my tutors. What about Louise Thomas? Never heard of her. Marco, you were seen, you were identified, and we've got tissue for a DNA test, which I think matches your cheek. So let's stop fooling around and start talking. You seemed really happy together. Yes, we were for a while. I don't really know what changed. Each time, she said it wouldn't happen again, each time, I wanted to believe her. She knew I'd never leave the kids. Do you know who she was seeing? No. It's probably a student - they usually were. The power trip - she got off on it. I'm really sorry. I really loved her. And she loved me - that's the stupid thing about it. I know that she loved me. It's my future Foreman is messing about with. It's not important any more. That's easy for you to say. No, it's not easy for me to say! I was attacked! Sorry. Sorry. Have they really arrested someone? Better than that - they've charged him. Annabelle Evans' dress. We'll have him for both. Where was the body kept? I don't know what you mean. The body was frozen. Where did he freeze it? Have you checked the freezers in the brothers' restaurant? Not yet. Is this a criminal investigation or what? A pathologist is telling me one thing, SOCO's telling me another, and none of it's making sense! Get Forensics to look at all that stuff. It'll probably turn out to be Lord Lucan's(!) Eden Blackman? I'm Dr Sam Ryan. Annabelle Evans was a friend of mine. Right. Let me grab a towel. I hadn't arranged to meet her. I was just chancing my arm. Did you leave with her? Um...I got a bit distracted. There was a bit of a contretemps with a townie and a student, so we... Well, we defended the honour of the college. And you succeeded? I actually felt a bit guilty. The guy was as drunk as a skunk, but he couldn't half pack a punch! Who were you defending? Simon Lovitz. He's a bit of a poof, but he didn't deserve a beating. Did Annabelle see that? No. Er, no, she just left. Do you know where she was going? Not a clue. But she did seem distracted. Why? Eden, if you know anything... I heard she'd been seeing someone at college, and it wasn't working out. Who told you? I can't remember. Did you tell the police? Yeah. Well, no. Look, I really liked Dr Evans, I think everybody did. She was a great tutor and she brought out the best in people. People are going to miss her. I think you might find this interesting. What? Blood tests came back. The blood on the sheets isn't Annabelle's. It's not even human. Pig's blood! Somebody's been visiting an abattoir. So the body was definitely moved. I'd say so. And by someone who knew that head wounds bleed profusely. Sergeant Bradley. Don't talk. You've caused me enough aggravation. I wouldn't have told. Yeah. What are you upset about? You were undercover. I was hoping to get under some covers, but it wasn't work. Oh, sorry. The wounds will heal with time. I heard you arrested Marco Rossi. Come to gloat, have you? No. I would. What made you bring him in? A witness saw him outside the flat. Is that all? No. He's got four huge great scratch marks on his face. Looks like he's wrestled a tiger. Be happy. You might have been right. A man was arrested early this morning in connection with the attack on Louise Thomas. He will appear in court tomorrow. He's 20 years old and unemployed. 'That's all I can tell you now.' Do we have enough to charge him? We'll worry about that tomorrow. Dr Ryan. I've come to have a word. See you in the pub? I'll be there soon. Pleased? What about? You were right, we were wrong. That's what I want to discuss. Would you..er...? Would you like to go for a drink? OK. There's this place by the river. But it's not suitable for 20 moronic coppers. The house wine's pretty good here. You're obviously a regular. I might make it my local, until they find out what I do for a living! I'm...er...sorry about the other day. That business with Bradley. I'm sorry he had to lie. Well, there you go then. We're both sorry. Is that all you're going to say? I'm sorry you're sorry. There's no point in going on. What does your wife do? She's still in London. She's waiting for me to find a house. That's a bit awkward. Yeah. It can be. Are you going to tell me why we've got the wrong man? The blood on the bedclothes - it isn't Annabelle's. What? It's pig's blood. That's an unexpected new suspect. It's probable that Annabelle was killed at one location, kept frozen, then moved to her house. The killer knew enough to make it look authentic. I don't think Marco could have. The big hole in your theory is the message on the answerphone. There's got to be a reason for that. It's been authenticated by an expert. It'll stand up in court as genuine. I don't think so. Having said that, I keep playing it over and over and... there's something not quite right. Maybe she was under pressure when she made the call. I don't think she was even alive. Look. I rang the hospital and they said you'd been released. That's really nice of you. Yeah, thanks. Have you got time for a coffee? Yeah, I have. The place is a mess. You don't mind, do you? It's all right. I'm going upstairs for a jumper. You stay here. I'll go. Thank you. So when do you give this place up? We don't. You're staying on? That's right. We're all doing PhDs. Well...as you know, I hope I'm going to be. Something will turn up. Yeah. What will you be researching? If he told you, you probably wouldn't understand! Try me. It's a...compression disk. Oh, really? Mmm. The idea is for it to be multi-formatted, compatible with music systems, CD-Roms, laser-disk players. It's going to have a memory capacity 3 to 4,000 times that of a normal CD. But it'll be the size of a watch face. You all look worse for wear here. You didn't make it? No, I was out of it by then. You've got to be in the survivor's photo. 'Professor, this is Annabelle Evans. 'Can't make meeting. 'Had to go away for the week. 'Sorry.' It's good. It's very good. In fact, it's superb. But there is a word missing? Mmm. Absolutely. "The" is missing in front of "meeting". That could be a slip of the tongue. So why are we here? Because you're right. Listen to this. 'To progress further on the ethical questions surrounding genetics 'would require a MEETING of minds.' One of Dr Evans' lecture tapes. We've listened to hundreds of them. And what we've found is this. Each spoken word has a unique sound print and can't be mistaken. This is the word "meeting" from the answerphone tape. And this is from the lecture tape. Look at the pattern. It's identical. Tape's been assembled. Someone has been over the lectures and spliced together the message. It's a work of genius. But it's still a fake. So the murderer played the message when they knew Leon Foreman was out. Exactly. She could have been dead for weeks, never mind days. One Survivor's photo. Great. Do you want to come in for a drink? No, thanks. Er...rowing practice. I'll let you have it back. Sure. Anytime. Hi. Shower. Hot water's not working. Get the landlord onto it. We did. About a month ago. But he's bloody useless. Huh. You been in any more fights recently? No. The bloke that hit you is the one they arrested for the attack on your friend? Yeah. Must be weird or something! Is he? Everyone says he's probably responsible for killing Dr Evans. It would make sense. I think the police are on a different line. Why do you say that? Dr Ryan wanted to see the Survivor's photo. She's the pathologist... Yes. Why did she want to see the photo? No idea. There are no townies on it, so it must be to do with a student. We weren't wearing evening dress. She will have noticed. So? She'll wonder why. It was taken at 6am! Some people hardly had any clothes on at all. She knows. She doesn't. She does. She might guess. That's all. What are you talking about? We've had it. She can't prove anything. There's nothing to prove. Are you sure? I want out. Don't be stupid, Simon. I can't sleep at night. I daren't look over my shoulder in case I'm being followed. I've had enough! Simon, calm down. You're involved. We're all involved. I can handle this without any trouble at all. Just leave it to me. Come on. It's going to be all right. BANG CREAKING RINGING TONE Hello. OK. Hold on. It's for you. Hello. Dr Ryan? Simon Lovitz here. I need to talk to you. What about? 'The May Ball.' What about it? I don't want to talk about it over the phone. Can you come to the flat? As soon as possible. 'All right. I'll be there in an hour.' I'd have thought you'd know by now. This is police work, not yours. Someone's making it my work. POP MUSIC PLAYS INSIDE SHE KNOCKS Simon! Simon? Simon? Perfect. I'm scared. Why? You were brilliant. What happens now? Simon sets up a meet, centre of town, and we create a scene. I can't do it. Yes, you can! All you have to do is shout at her to stop harassing you. This is going to make things worse. Come on. I wouldn't let you down, would I? Eh? Aaaagh! How are you feeling?  I'm fine. Let me call a doctor. I am a doctor. I nearly said "a real one" then. KNOCK ON DOOR Excuse me. Forensics rang. They found a letter on the body. He was going to tell her everything! How do you know? He told me. He wasn't going to do what we planned. So you killed him? Don't be ridiculous. We were arguing. I was trying to reason with him, but he jumped! You hit me, didn't you? You bastard! You bastard! I had to make it look real! Throw them off. They weren't onto us! They would have found out. You used me! Just like Annabelle. From what I remember, you were very willing to help. Forget her. I'm glad she's gone. I'm glad Simon's gone. Now it really is just the two of us. Me and you. Always. This letter claims you were harassing him. He says you didn't leave him alone. Blamed him for Annabelle's death. What? He says last night you rang him 15 times. I never called him once. He claims you came round to see him, banging on the door, refusing to go away. No. He even claims you stole a diary. This is stupid. Did you have contact with Simon? Yes. I've been to his flat. On his request. Trevor was there when he rang. Well, you know this is all lies! Let's just get you home. Sam! I came as soon as I could. Are you all right? I'm fine. I'm fine. How...? The police rang me. Thanks for coming. I don't expect it. Expect what you want. I'm here when you need me. Do you want a drink? I'm making some tea. Do the police want to see you again? Yes. I'll go after the post-mortem when they can... Can what? Sorry? You were saying something. No. It's nothing. Who's this? What? I didn't do this. One of the neighbours described a woman banging on Lovitz's door. She fitted your description. I've been set up. Your phone records show you phoned him 17 times in one night. I never phoned him once. Last night, when I got home, I found these in my kitchen. I have to go to the station to interview Nick Arnold. Go lecture. Go on holiday. But keep a low profile for a while. You're very kind. Thank you. I'll try her there. PHONE RINGS Most of our visitors knock. Did Annabelle used to knock? You don't even know if she came here. I think she did. The night of the May Ball. You needed her backing for the PhD. That's hardly news! But it wasn't working out between you. So I killed her? You thought you'd get away with it. Thought you were so clever. You already know I'm clever. You met her back here. Then what happened? Maybe she told you your work wasn't good enough. Maybe she'd found someone better. So then what? She told me I wasn't going to be her research fellow, that everything I'd worked for meant nothing. So... I picked up a bottle... and smacked her on the head. Yeah? But she wasn't dead, was she? So you suffocated her. Did I? Where were the others? You tell me. It's your story. You were all involved somehow. Or why the new clothes for the Survivor's photo? I have very loyal friends. So they did help you? Sounds plausible. But it's not true. You can't prove it. I can't prove you planted the dress and money at Marco's place. I can't prove you planted the diary and the shirt at mine. I can't prove you pushed Simon off the top of a car park. But I can prove that Annabelle's body was put in the freezer, and that you thawed her out in the bath. You're lying. Then... how can I let you go? KNOCKING Open the door! Police! Open the door! Nicholas Arnold, I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder. It's a waste of time. It may harm your defence if you do not mention something you rely upon later in court. Do you need a lift back? No. I've got to go and see someone. Nick Arnold's been arrested. Ah! You knew, didn't you? You knew what had happened long ago. I had no proof. I had no proof. This wasn't a game, Leon! Why didn't you say something? Well, I'm not the police. I just let things... run their course. You enjoyed it. You enjoyed watching us all! A boy died! I used to look up to you. You had all the answers. I wanted your respect, your approval. To be like you. And so you are, Sam. You stand victorious. ♪ Testator silens ♪ Costestes e spiritu ♪ Silentium. ♪ Subtitles by BBC
