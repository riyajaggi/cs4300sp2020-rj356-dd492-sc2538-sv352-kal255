 Silent Witness (1996–…): Season 3, Episode 5 - Divided Loyalties Part 1 - full transcript 
 Sam Ryan looks into the death of Maggie Collins who died of a heroin overdose. Sadly, her body wasn't discovered for several days and in that time, her infant daughter died of dehydration. Soon after Maggie's death Stephen Jackson, a small-time dealer and addict, is killed in an explosion in his home. The autopsy reveals that both of them died of overdoses from the same batch of heroin and Sam begins to doubt that their deaths were accidental. When another small-time dealer is killed, the police think they have either vigilantes or a turf war on their hands. What they have is something far more complex that involves one of their own.

 You were quick. Shall I wait outside(?) Oh, I think we can make an exception. Your client's in the living room. Did the neighbours report this? They only call the police if they need target practice. The local station got a tip-off. Uniforms checked it out, found this. Do I need a degree to figure this one out? ..Sorry. Took her by surprise. Bad batch? Or too pure - can be worse. Was the whole flat searched? Richard searched it, I think. You think?

 Shall I ask him? He's not feeling too hot. What's the problem? This is the problem. ♪ Testator Sile-ens ♪ Costestes e Spiritu-um ♪ Si-ilentiu-um. ♪ Dr Ryan? Court one, please. 'I found no sign' of disease or physical trauma - cause of death was by dehydration. So, the mother having perished of an overdose, she left her child to die of thirst? Yes, that would be consistent with my findings. How long would the infant have survived? Um... Well, it's difficult to say. Three, perhaps four, days.

 Would the child have been conscious, crying for help? Before lapsing into a coma, yes. Thank you, Dr Ryan. You've been most helpful. The GP? "..The evidence I shall give shall be the truth, "the whole truth and nothing but the truth." You were the deceased's GP? Both Miss Collins and her son were on my list. You mean, her daughter? Her daughter...yes. Sorry. Were you aware the deceased was a drug-user? She was on a course of methadone. She'd given up using heroin? So she claimed. But on her last visit she asked me to increase her dosage. I suspected she might be abusing the prescription. Did you increase her dosage? No. I suggested she visit a rehabilitation agency. And did she? I have no idea. ..I presumed, when she made no further appointments, that she had. Judging by the manner of her death, however, it would seem unlikely. Yes, it would. Thank you, Dr Newman. That will be all. I sincerely hope the dealers who sold this woman drugs will show some scrap of remorse for the tragedy they've caused, though I somehow doubt it. The verdict in both cases is death by misadventure. Andy! Try down there - it's a car crash. What are you doing here? Delivering. Some lawyers like a bit of sparkle. Put it away! Do you some wholesale? It's a courthouse! Last place the filth would look! Dr Newman... Yes? Dr Ryan - forensic pathologist on the Collins case. Oh, hello. I was thinking about Frances Collins - the little girl. What about her? Did you consider her as being at risk? We're no longer obliged to report these cases. Obliged?! You thought her mother was back on heroin. I have a very busy practice - 3,000 patients all demanding my attention. That girl was your patient. She relied on you. If the responsibility's too much to bear, maybe you're in the wrong job. What I find hard to bear are "experts" with 20:20 hindsight! Good day, Dr Ryan. 'It's five to six and here's the shipping forecast. 'There are warnings of gales in Forties, Fisher, German Bight...' SWITCHES RADIO OFF Coffee? Got some. I'd better make some more, then(!) None left? So what's happening? Chelsea lost again. What d'you reckon the motor's worth? ã20,000, cash. Three weeks selling skag! We're in the wrong sodding job, mate. Is Jackson still in bed? No, he's taken his horse out for a canter(!) Smartarse! CAR ALARMS GO OFF Christ Almighty! Yes, of course. I appreciate that. I'm sure Dr Ryan didn't mean to cast aspersions on... If that's how you perceived it, I... I'll take it up with her at the earliest opportunity. Dr Newman, a little distraught. See how distraught he is when I report him for professional negligence. That's the appropriate course of action? A child is dead. Her mother is dead. No relatives have been traced. Who else will stand up for her? The Collins baby? You're implying that because a baby is involved, I've lost objectivity? Sam! It hadn't even occurred to me. But? Why are you reacting this way? Because Frances Collins' death could have been prevented. It was so futile. So needlessly cruel. But was it Newman's fault? Our job is to find out the cause of death, not to assign blame. It's hard. Sometimes there is no-one to blame. It's just Death, going about his business. You think I should go easy on Dr Newman. To hell with Newman! I think you should go easy on yourself. Good morning. Hi. Gas leak? Either that or a hell of a party. Fire brigade have finished, sir. A ring on the cooker left on. Gas central heating set it off. How many victims? One - in the sitting room. Looks like he lit up and passed out. Maybe. Send drug samples to Toxicology. Blood and tissue I can do at the postmortem. Sir. It's a regular chemist's shop. I think that's heroin. This is definitely cocaine. Well, that's why he didn't smell anything. Probably worn his nose out. I wonder what he was cooking. I can give you a clue. Mr Jackson wasn't exactly a cordon bleu chef. Morning, Jo. I thought you were the Murder Squad, Mike, not British Gas. DCI Hoskins, Drug Squad. This is Dr Sam Ryan, forensic pathologist. Hi. I thought I could help out with some background. You knew the victim? Small-time dealer. His idea of haute cuisine was rock cocaine - crack. Must have fallen asleep with the recipe. I bet you're gutted(!) Less filing to worry about. If it's OK with you, I'd rather base my conclusions on evidence, not speculation and guesswork. Sorry, Mike. For a minute there, I thought you were in charge. Thanks. So, what's the verdict? I can't say until I've done a postmortem. If it WAS an accident, there's no point keeping this lot on. Whose verdict do you want? Mine or DCI Hoskins'? It's not up to her, it's up to me. But I'd appreciate your opinion. As I said, I don't have one yet. We confirmed the victim's ID. Steven Jackson, 28 years old. Plenty of form - possession with intent to supply, mainly. Says here he drives a BMW. Yeah. Well, where is it? I didn't see it parked outside. I'll get Traffic on to it. Any luck with eyewitnesses? No. Not even a milkman? Not there - not without an armoured float. OK - known associates? Rollie Stewart, Jackson's partner. We're looking for him. The other one calls himself Andy Fox. Another small-time dealer seen hanging out with Jackson. Don't know much about him. Find them. The body's been identified as one Steven Jackson, aged 28 years. He shows severe lacerations to the front of his body, with numerous fragments of glass peppering the skin. Smoke blackening to the exposed areas, consistent with the body being in the close vicinity of an explosion. What appears to be an injection site inside the right elbow. Some bruising, indicating the wound is recent. So he wasn't smoking it, he was shooting up. DOGS BARK LOUD MUSIC PLAYS THEY WHISPER Mr Fox? Would you like a lift down the station? Not right now, no. Fine. We'll do the strip-search here. DI Connor, CID. Get in. You've been busy. Yeah, yeah. Life's too short. Cut the crap if you're going to nick me. I'm talking about this murder. What you on about? Your mate Jackson. Said something to offend you, did he? Right, I want a brief. Suit yourself. That was easy, wasn't it? Why would I want to kill him? Why would anyone? We're not big time. So, it's more of a hobby, is it? We just meet a demand. Like you - everyone hates us till they need us. So who just hates you? Oh, come on! The vicars, the council, that wanker from the rehab centre... All those caped crusaders wanting to clean the streets up. We are just providing a service. Very public-spirited of you(!) Pull over, Bradley. Oh, don't leave us here. They're only going to think I'm a grass. Thank you for your assistance, Mr Fox. How's it going? Great(!) I've spent the day sticking my head down every toilet in town. I want to discuss my conclusions on Jackson's postmortem. Hi. Do you mind if Jo sits in on this? Might help save you a lot of grief. One or two anomalies have arisen. The heroin in his blood was enough to kill him. In another half-hour, he'd have overdosed. But he was a user. His tolerance would have been higher. I did find a recent injection site in his right arm. I couldn't find any others. No(?) The body WAS cut to ribbons. There was only one injection site, and muscular distribution suggests he was right-handed. So? So why was the injection in his right arm? Users will put the needle where they can find a vein. You must know that. I got a toxicological examination of the drugs he injected. As you know, street heroin can be cut with a variety of substances - talc, glucose, rat poison. The combination can create a distinctive chemical profile. This sample was taken from Jackson, this one from Maggie Collins, the mother who overdosed. The chemical profile is practically identical. So Jackson's stuff was from the batch that killed Collins. I want to apply for Collins to be exhumed. Exhumed? I'm not satisfied Jackson's death was accidental. I want to compare the bodies for common features. You want to dig her up because she was using the same smack? We haven't even agreed Jackson's death was suspicious. You know you have to ask the Home Office? I am aware of that. They'll refer back to the officer in charge. I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but I'd be nervous about approving it on this evidence. The point of it is to find more evidence. Which you overlooked? Yes. What's to stop you overlooking it again? You have my findings. If you'll excuse me? Thanks, Sam. Yes, thank you. She would have loved those. I didn't bring them, I'm afraid. Have we met? I was her brother. I'm sorry. I didn't know they'd traced any relatives. They haven't. I saw you at the inquest. Why didn't you step forward? Cos they were dead. Besides, I've made too many court appearances. Having a record wouldn't matter. No? Unless it was to do with drugs. I see what you're getting at. Listen, I was as cut up as anyone about this. Last time I saw her, she'd kicked the gear, she had a kid - I was really happy for her. Then I heard her and Frances was dead. There's something wrong there. What do you mean? This is someone's fault. You think so too. That's why you're here. There's no proof either way. If you find any, will you let me know? Down the Red Knight pub most nights. Do you know it? Who should I ask for? Mr Collins? Andy. KNOCK AT DOOR Come in. This your report? Up until 6.30 this morning, when the place went up. Then we thought we should clear out. Nice work. We did an extra set for CID. Magic. You two got enough to keep you busy? Yes, Guv. Why are you still hanging round here, then? 'Heroin is the greatest buzz on God's Earth - you're gorgeous,' you're witty, you're invincible. You can leap tall buildings in a single bound, brain bursting with ideas, heart singing the Hallelujah Chorus. And it's so cheap, you know? One ripped-off car radio and you're smacked up all night. ..So, come on - why not? Cos it's stupid. Bloody right, it's stupid. Jumping out of a plane's a buzz till you find you don't have a parachute. Then what? Splat. You're bored. You know? Nothing on the telly. Your maw's on your back, the school's crap and all your mates are saying, "Come on, try this." And soon you're not bored any more. You're waking up with your guts full of razor blades, wondering if anyone will notice you flogged the video. ..OK, you lot. I'll be back in a minute. I need to talk to some people. Martin Greaves? Yeah. What can I do for you? DI Connor, DS Bradley, CID. We're making inquiries about the explosion in Holly Street. People have been making threats against the tenant, Steven Jackson. People - meaning me? Did you threaten him? I told him what I thought of him. Parasite! So you knew him? I know all the pushers. It's my business. "Know thine enemy." Aren't you a sort of poacher-turned-gamekeeper? I used to have a habit. That's one reason I'd like to wipe out the whole stinking trade. Starting with the dealers? Aw, look, guys! Pegasus runs projects for kids. We rehouse addicts, find them new lives. We're a registered charity, not a guerilla army. Do you have an alibi for last night? No. Will I need one? Thank you, Mr Greaves. We'll be in touch. Why waste your time with Jackson? He was cooking crack and blew himself up. Good riddance to bad rubbish. You know a lot about it. It's all over the street. Just like him. It sounds like good news to me. Too bloody good! Do a PNC for us. Yes! PHONE RINGS Jo Hoskins. Where the hell have you been? ..Look, we can discuss all that when you come in. ..It's too hot out there! What if Jackson was murdered? ..You know you could be next? I want you in. ..Yes, it is an ord...! Shit! INTERCOM BUZZES What? Send her in. Is this a good time? As good as any. I hope you don't mind me carrying on. Another charity boxing tournament(!) I wanted to discuss the Collins case with you. You're familiar with it? We try to keep track of drug-related deaths. It's one way of keeping the score. I don't quite understand why you're so opposed to exhumation. Well, the next of kin can find it distressing. Not knowing how a loved one died can be just as distressing. But you know how she died - you were the pathologist. And I might have missed something. Oh, I doubt it! Michael Connor speaks highly of you. You seem to think I'm asking because I'm emotionally involved. We're all involved. We wouldn't be any good at our jobs otherwise. Look, Collins gave up on methadone and went back to smack. It killed her, her baby died - end of story. But why? Same reason she took it in the first place - it's the best high there is. How can you be sure that's all there is to it? Because I have people on the ground - people who know what's going on. Collins and her baby are dead and buried, and we really should leave them that way. Now, I'm sorry, but I have to go. How do I look? Knockout. Kelly, make sure everything's locked up, OK? OK. Sergeant. Guv! Hi, Sarge. Didn't recognise you. Who are you supposed to be? Still a sergeant. ♪ ..Sometimes it's hard to be a woman... ♪ Givin' all your love to just one man... ♪ What you after, then?  Bit of rough? Don't come much rougher than me, love. Excuse me. Some powder for that cute little nose? Looking for me? Piss off. I was here first. Leave off, Rollie. Bit up-market for you. Where do you think you're going? Listen, Rollie. How are you going to wipe your arse when I've ripped your arms off and fed 'em to Baz's dog? Through there. Friend? Business acquaintance. What have you got? Not going to offer me a drink? Sure. What do you want? Is the water safe? Never touch the stuff. Baz - glass of cold water with bubbles, please. I didn't think you'd show up. Why not? "Professional confidence." Even if you knew nothing, you wouldn't say. Even if you were her brother? ..Cheers, mate. Keep the change. Barry's saving up for some new teeth. Last time, I was sure I'd seen you somewhere before. Yeah - in court. No, it was in another court. Three years ago? You were giving evidence in a murder trial. You're thinking of someone else. We met that evening, at a charity ball. I've still got the photographs. That was a long time ago. You're not a policeman any more, then? ..No. And they all know, do they? So, if I was to mention it to Barry, he wouldn't want to stick a glass in your face? Can we take this outside? What are you after, eh? Want to stir up the pond life, then sod off? I'm after the truth! You ain't got a clue, have you? Two weeks ago, some plain-clothes moron was asking questions. He's still up in the hospital! Did you help him? I held his coat. I'm not going to give you away. You know that. What have you found out about Collins? Jackson sold her the heroin. Why did you say you're her brother? Why were you at the graveyard? Why were you there? Paying my respects! I knew her, OK. I even sold her smack once before she gave it up. It was me that found the bodies. The kid had only been dead a few hours. There was nothing I could do but call it in. I'm applying for the body to be exhumed. No, don't bother. I went through the flat. You didn't miss anything. She shot up, she died. But why did she ask that doctor for more methadone? She wasn't a dealer. Why don't you ask him? I can't. But you can. It's no problem. You're not walking home alone. Be careful, darling! You wouldn't be the first girl he's had in the club. Hang on. Planning a party? I can do you some refreshments. Stay away from my place! No-one wants your crap around here, so just piss off! That's not quite true, is it, Martin? What would your fans think if they find out how you get your kicks? Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Ignore him. Jump in. I might tell a few people. You just don't get it, do you? No-one's going to listen to a smacked-up street rat like you. 'Dr Ryan?' BABIES CRY AND PHONES RING Thanks for agreeing to see me. You're very busy. Yes, I am. Is this about the Collins case? Yes and no. I wanted to apologise for the other day at the coroner's court. It was unfair and unprofessional of me to attack you like that. It was a painful episode for everybody. I don't suppose we'll ever know why she wanted a bigger prescription. Probably to sell it on. Methadone abuse is a growing problem. Some people think it's as bad as heroin. What do you think? They're missing the point. Alcohol abuse does more damage, but it's taken for granted. If they legalised heroin, it would cause fewer social problems. It's an unusual position - for a GP. You'd be surprised. I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful. What did you do when she asked for more methadone? I refused. But you kept her on the same prescription? I withdrew it. When a doctor-patient relationship goes, you must consider the implications. Wouldn't she have no choice but to use heroin? She had a choice - I suggested visiting Martin Greaves. Martin Greaves? For rehabilitation. I said this at the inquest. No, you said you had no idea where she went after leaving you. I don't. I have patients to see. Of course. Thanks for your time, Dr Newman. You're welcome. DCI Hoskins, please. ..No, never mind. It's personal. Thank you. CAR ALARM BLEEPS You're jumpy, man. Gotta learn to relax. How'd you get on with the Ice Queen, then? Defrost her, or what? Ain't you been nicked yet? Filth don't bother me. Busy? Yeah! Thinking of standing for parliament. You're not bent enough. ..I could use a runner, though. Stevie left a big gap in the market. Piss off. You don't want to talk to me like that. It's not good for your health. Neither is standing close to you. Yeah, keep it up. You'll end up like Stevie. Thing is, he started to annoy me, stealing my punters. So I paid him a visit and the next morning the filth are picking him up with the Hoover. Lighten up! I like you, man. You can handle yourself. You can make me a lot of money. I'll think about it. Dr Ryan? Hello. Sure you're not with the police? No, I'm not. Good. They seem to think I'm some sort of ninja assassin. Apparently I blew up that wanker Jackson(!) I'm here about a woman called Collins. Maggie Collins? You knew her? Well, she came here a few times, but she was never really that bothered. What do you mean? She was a smackhead - dyed-in-the-wool. How do you know? In this business, believe me - we know. So you sent her away? We don't send anybody away. We offered to sort her out, get her a job, find her a new place to live, break the cycle of dependency - it's what we do for everyone. But she wasn't interested? No. Now she's dead. Shame about the wean, though, eh? So why did she come at all? Newman sent her. I told him he was wasting his time. You told him? Oh, yeah. He's always sending us his write-offs. He said he didn't know if she came. Not always on the ball, is he - Dr Newman? I'm sure he's a nice guy, and all. I'm just glad he's not my doctor. Messages? A Dr Newman called. Three times. Newman? ..What did he want? He wouldn't say. Personal, apparently. Fine. ..While you're here, Kelly, I'd like you to dig out some files downstairs. All fatalities in the last year where the investigating pathologist was Dr Sam Ryan. The last YEAR? Yes. ..An hour with the card index should sort it. Couldn't I get it from her office? If that's what I wanted you to do, that's what I would have asked you to do. Sort us out some teas, would you? White, no sugar. I'll have the usual. After you. You stayed in the pub till closing time? Anyone see you? I dunno. Where did you go afterwards? Bed. You went home? No, I went to bed. Then home, about one o'clock. You live round the corner from Steven Jackson. You used to be mates. We used to do business together, yeah. Selling drugs? Did you drop in on your way home? Let me think... No. I would have remembered, what with the place exploding. What do you know about that? It made a hell of a mess. Why were you picked up in his car? It's not his car. Jackson's the registered keeper. I paid for it. That what the argument was about? The police were called and you were charged with threatening behaviour. It was my car. He stole it from me. And that's why you killed him. Says who? Says you, according to our witnesses. And they'll stand up in court? You told everyone else, why not tell us? You offered Jackson some smack. When he passed out, you left the gas on. My mind's gone blank. Know what I think? I think we owe Mr Stewart an apology. You fell out over the car. When you heard the explosion, you took it before anyone noticed. Since then, you've been going round telling everybody how hard you are, how you sorted Jackson out because he nicked your customers. What are you talking about? Interview terminated at 1.13pm. Aren't you going to take a statement? If you want to tell fairy stories, go work in a nursery. Now piss off out of my nick! Having fun? Just wasted an hour on a bullshit merchant called Rollie Stewart. Twitchy little runt. Fancies himself as a drugs baron. Thanks for letting us know, ma'am(!) You only have to ask. You know where my office is. LOUD MUSIC PLAYS AND DOGS BARK Agh! Agh! 'Hello?' Mike, it's Jo. Sorry to bother you so late, but we have to talk. KNOCKING KNOCKING So who did this? Same ones who did Jackson, probably. Is someone trying to wipe out dealers? Collins wasn't a dealer. Newman thought so. That's why he stopped her methadone. He stopped it? Are we talking about vigilantes? Well-connected vigilantes. The guys who did this were cops. The police are involved? Why not? You spend ages making a case against some scumbag, who walks with a fine. This way, you don't have to bother with paperwork. Sounds right up your street. I'm not that kind of policeman. You break the rules every day. Yeah, and I report it in. Are you reporting this to Hoskins? I'm reporting it to you. So watch yourself, OK? Whoever's behind this must know you've been asking questions. They won't like it. That needs a stitch and I have no anaesthetic. I have. But I don't use it. TOOTS HORN For God's sake! Hi. Have you been making inquiries about Maggie Collins? I'm interested in the case. It's closed. The Jackson case isn't. I think the Collins case has a bearing on it. We discussed this. And you decided not to take it further, so I did. It's not your place to follow it up. I've had a complaint about witnesses being harassed. Who's complaining? I'm asking you not to interfere. I'm not interfering. That's not how some people see it. You or DCI Hoskins? It doesn't matter who, Sam. You are well out of order. If we're discussing complaints, call me Dr Ryan. If you don't like the way I work, see the coroner! It needn't come to that. It already has. You don't know what you're getting into. And you do? PHONE BUZZES Connor. Bradley, I am not interested in burnt-out cars. You will be in this one, sir. It's Jackson's car, the one Stewart took. Where is it? I'll be there in 15 minutes. We can finish this later. As far as I'm concerned, we already have. So you'll stay clear of the Jackson case? Christ! Might have been joyriders torching the evidence. Those two found it. Memorised the numberplate before it melted. Sir? This door was closed when the fire started, or it wouldn't be so badly damaged. Someone was in here and nearly didn't get out. Where's Stewart? Not seen since yesterday. Hasn't reported it stolen. Here's why. There are flash burns to his face, superficial burns to the trunk. He'd been in the car for some time after the fire had started. Unconscious? Not necessarily. He'd been tied up. Has full-thickness burns to the leg. Full thickness? To the bone. Must've been in agony. What do you think? Same guy that killed Jackson? You said his death was accidental. Yes, but two dealers dead in two days? Some coincidence! Get a call in to DCI Hoskins.  Sir. Had you spoken to him? Had I "interfered with this witness too"? Sam. No, but I'll have to now. Couldn't Dr Ryan have waited for me? She's found evidence you should see. She'll find what she needs to fit her pet theories. Dr Ryan. Hello. Perhaps you can take DCI Hoskins through your findings? The, um, edited highlights, anyway. Of course. Roland Stewart. Bound hand and foot, and left in a car which was set alight. Did he burn to death, or suffocate? Neither. He died of a heroin overdose. Had massive levels of opiates in his bloodstream. No accident. Suicides rarely tie themselves up. I was struck by the parallels with Steven Jackson's death, so I carried out a second examination. I found faint but distinct striations on both wrists and ankles, consistent with the use of soft ligatures. Stewart and Jackson were both tied up before being injected. Toxicology tests on Stewart's blood confirm that heroin found on him had an identical chemical profile to that in Jackson and Collins, proving without a doubt that the three cases are linked, as I stated earlier. Looks like vigilantes. Or turf war. With rival dealers? I can think of a few names. Would they bother with Maggie Collins? No. She was a punter who bought off them. What if she's a key to the case? What makes you think that? Look, Mike's a good detective. I suggest we let him do his job. Thanks for the briefing. Catch you at the nick. So you'll ignore my most important finding? I can't justify exhumation. There's what I've shown you. I know you don't get on. She seems to have convinced you that I have some personal agenda. What makes you think SHE hasn't? KNOCKING Come in. So where the hell is Fox? Sorry, guv. We could try again...with backup. Oh, yeah. VERY low-profile(!) ONE... bloody drug-pusher! You're bleeding on my carpet. Interesting place to meet. You didn't strike me as religious. Fox isn't. Me, I like churches. Neutral territory. Not where I come from. Where did YOU disappear to last night? Got a thing about needles. Anyway, thought I'd better get hold of Stewart before anyone else did. Did you? No. I saw somebody get into his car - a guy called Greaves. Runs a rehab project called Pegasus. I know him. I wonder what HE wanted with Stewart. ..How d'you know Greaves? I spoke to him yesterday morning, about Maggie Collins. You mean Newman sent her to him? You've got to come in. Not until I get more answers. Look. Someone IS targeting drug dealers. If you don't quit now, next time we meet you'll be on my slab. Kinky! Please. Talk to DI Connor. Never met him. You can trust him. You'll bet my life on that? Well... At least tell him what you witnessed. And if you don't, I will. And he'll want to know how I know. At some point in the last week, someone must've seen Stewart! Junkies'll hardly be queuing up! Mike. A few faces you might find interesting. Jenson. Gardiner. Who are they? North London dealers. Been making a lot of noise about expanding out East. Banged heads with Stewart and Jackson. Get on the phone. I want these two checked out. Someone once told me, whenever evidence falls into your lap, the first question to ask is "Why?" Sounds like someone pretty cynical. You. PHONE RINGS No, outside with that, guys. I'll just be five minutes, OK? What are YOU doin' here? Interested in your rehab programme. Oh, really(?) Well, we don't deal with pushers, so you can get out. You dealt with Rollie Stewart. I saw you climb into his car last night. Hours later, he's OD'd and roasted. You're trippin' on your own shit. Who's next? Me? We live in hope. I think you and your mates fancy yourselves as vigilantes. I'm not into heavy stuff. I saw you with Stewart! Don't pretend you don't know him. I knew him! You knew Maggie Collins. ..Who? She was a smackhead... Bullshit! She'd been stable on methadone for months. Someone wanted her dead. She had cops lookin' after her!! Cops? WHAT cops?! Drug Squad. She wanted Collins out of here. As far away as possible. It didnae work out. You were working for Hoskins? She's a friend of ours. So don't mess wi' us. You don't want HER on your case. DOOR OPENS Hello. Hi. I thought you might like to help with some routine inquiries. That's why I'm here. Not in your "official" capacity. It's about this man. Have you seen him? Have you seen him? Yes, I have. We met at the graveside of Maggie Collins. He claimed to be her brother. He isn't. So who IS he? He has SEVERAL identities. He's equally plausible in all of them. What did he want? To know about the Collins case. Says there's more to her death than came out at the inquest. And you said? We'd no evidence either way. Good. Things HAVE changed, of course, since then. Dr Ryan, this man is extremely unstable. Incapable of telling truth from fantasy. It'd be a serious mistake to encourage him... or to believe anything he tells you. When was the last time you saw him? About an hour ago. I see. Have you arranged to meet him again? No. Well, the next time he gets in touch, I'd advise you to let us know immediately. The Drug Squad or just you, as you seem to be taking such a personal interest? Tell him if he gives up now, we might still be able to help him. PHONE RINGS, CHILD CRIES It's a new patient - a Mr Andrews. Mr Andrews, please. DOOR OPENS Mr Andrews. Come in. Sit down. I gather you want to go on my list. ..I'm sure we can fit you in. Great. The thing is, Doc, I've got a bit of a habit, and I was hoping to kick it. Go on methadone... Well, I usually like some kind of reference. Previous GP, for instance. But it's possible? It usually is. For the first months, YOU pick up your prescription, earn our trust. Sure. Let me down, YOU lose. I won't, as long as YOU don't let ME down. How do you mean? Like cut off my course halfway through. I wouldn't. You did it to whatshername. Collins. She was one of yours, wasn't she? I won't discuss other patients. It's right. You stopped her methadone cos the Old Bill told you to. What's that Hoskins got on you? Sorry. I don't think I can help you... after all. That's all right, Doc. You already have. Two dealers from your area - Jenson and Gardiner. Any info on their recent movements? Sir. DI Connor. 'A mutual friend told me to call.' Who is this? Ask Martin Greaves what he was doing with Stewart last night. Who is it? It could be those two, sir. Got the right form and no-one knows their exact whereabouts. Forget about them. - Mr Greaves. - What the hell's this? - Like to answer a few questions? - About what? The murder of Rollie Stewart. Four guys to pick me up. Am I supposed to be flattered? They're here to search the premises. Any chance I could put a shirt on(?) I'll come with you. I HAVE put a shirt on before. Oy! Sorry, Miss. It's OK, Denise. They smash things up and bugger off. Always sleep with your clientele? What's the charge? Getting ma leg over? That depends what else we find. THEY BICKER OVER APPOINTMENTS Doctor'll see you as soon as he can. You told me this would be strictly between ourselves. 'I've drug addicts marching into my surgery asking if DCI Hoskins will cut off their methadone.' Calm down. I have a good idea who this guy is. The point is, who else has he told? We'll find him. We have good informants. I know. I'm one of them. You helped us fight drugs. Betraying patients to bolster your career. That's bad enough, but Collins... You made a legitimate clinical decision. 'She and the child died.' Sign this. Just GET OUT!! I'll do no more of your dirty work. It'd be a serious error of judgement. It wouldn't be your first. Are you threatening me? I'm stating facts. If you go public... you'll face the consequences. We ALL will, won't we? This job, pays well? It's a charity. I'm not in it for the money. You've a big house, flash car. It's a company car. We spoke to the garage where you bought it. You paid cash. So they do us a special deal. I spend our funds responsibly. On an S class Mercedes(?) They're dependable cars! Look, let's just skip the bullshit. You say I'm ripping off the charity. The house, car - legitimate expenses. I thought this was a murder investigation. Who knew you were ripping off the charity? Stewart? For God's sake! When DID you last see him? Night before last. He was outside the Project. You didn't meet him last night to buy smack? I don't use that crap any more. Item 1. A plastic pouch found under floorboards at Mr Greaves' home, containing about 6gm of heroin. That stuff was planted! We planted your fingerprints over it, too(?) I've handled plenty of plastic bags! You'd be willing to take a blood test to show you haven't used heroin recently? OK. I-I use it now and then. For the buzz. But I didn't get that off Stewart. D'you sell it to him? No. Strange. Because the chemical profile of this stuff matches exactly the heroin we found on Stewart's body. You were buying it off him. He was gonna tell everyone about your nasty little habit. That would mean goodbye to the lovely house, the "dependable" Mercedes... He was alive when I left him. You DID meet? I was in and out of his car in two minutes. He dropped me off near the Eastern House nightclub. Anybody see you? I didn't WANT anybody to see me. (Oh, dear.) PHONE RINGS Sam Ryan. Dr Ryan? This is Bernard Newman. Dr Newman. Hello. Look, about Collins. Certain aspects of my...treatment were... irregular. Such as? Would it be possible for us to meet? TWIG SNAPS RUNNING FOOTSTEPS DOG BARKS BARKING CONTINUES BARKING STARTS UP AGAIN DOG WHINES God... Like me to call you a taxi? Martin will give me a lift. Mr Greaves might be some time. You're pathetic, picking on him. He's helping with inquiries on several matters. It's because he isn't one of you - narrow-minded pricks who want everyone to stick to their rules. (Denise, we have reason to believe he's a drug user. OK? (If that's true, he's been lying to you. He's been lying to everyone.) He never lied to ME. How d'you mean exactly? DOORS OPEN Well, Mr Greaves. I managed to get hold of the doormen outside the Eastern House last night, and, um... your story checks out. Finally! Can I go now? Once we've sorted out the charge of possession with intent to supply. Come on. That was for personal use. So you didn't offer any to Denise, to help loosen her up? (Stupid little bitch!) I'm buggered, amn't I? I'm afraid it's out of my hands. I COULD put on record that you cooperated with our other inquiries. What...? Maggie Collins came to you for rehab. What's SHE got to do with this? She was good-looking. You seem to enjoy a hands-on approach with female clients. I slept with her, yeah... But it was just a one-night stand, and...she seemed pretty willing. I bet. Especially after you offered her free drugs. How long had she gone without methadone by then? Two days? Regular Casanova, aren't you? PHONE RINGS Connor. SIREN WAILS What the hell are YOU doing here? He wanted to discuss the Collins case. I said to stay out of it. Yes. But I don't answer to you. For God's sake, it could've been you! What happened? We used to talk to each other. Yeah, and you used to listen to me. All right. Any observations about the body? I haven't done an examination. I'm a material witness. Let's skip the lecture on professional ethics. This is not the time or the place. The position of the arms behind the back suggest he's been tied up. The right sleeve's been pulled up. Another needle job. What were you gonna discuss? Why he cut off her methadone. He thought she was selling it on. No. Someone leant on him. Who? I think he was going to tell me. LOUD MUSIC: "Weak As I Am" by Skunk Anansie Can you fix me up? What've you done? Oh, oh, let's see your money first. I'll keep it for you. My purse! RAISED VOICES What YOU doin' here?! I'll rip your nose out! Are you planning to score now or just get raped in the bogs? I CAN look after myself! How old are you? I saw you in Pegasus. What'll Mr Greaves say? I don't give a toss. He fixed me up before. I wanna do it again. How much have you got? You never learn! Just piss off! Who do you think you are, my social worker, or something?! Inspector. Sam.  ..Dr Newman. HE'S cheerful(?) A man should enjoy his work. Fred, happy birthday. Doing anything special? I'm wearing silk underwear. Trevor, we don't wanna rush you, but, um... OK, let's not procrastinate or beat about the bush. The subject has been identified as one Bernard Newman. Subject has been dead just over 12 hours. Bruising on the wrists suggests restraints were applied. What sort? Hard, narrow bands, probably metal, uniformly circumscribing both wrists. Single depression on one side, two parallel on the other. Handcuffs. On the crook of the right arm, there is the site of a recent injection with a hypodermic needle. Faint bruising is becoming evident. There are no obvious signs of physical trauma. ..Fred, pass us a sterile swab, will you? There's what appears to be a... ..deposit of saliva in the folds of the right ear. Unlikely to be that of the victim. You mean his attacker spat on him? I give you the miracle of DNA! We'll get the DNA processed as quickly as possible. But we need existing samples. What exactly did Newman say? He wanted to meet to discuss the Collins case. Why didn't he tell you over the phone? Didn't wanna go into details. AS if someone might've been listening in? You think his phone was tapped? ..Where are you going? Jackson's house. I think I might have missed something. I'll give you a lift. PHONE RINGS Hoskins. 'It's me. We need to talk.' - What about? - Connor's been asking about Collins. 'What did you tell him?' What YOU said to say! He didn't believe me. I'm screwed. They charged me with possession. I'll lose my job, house, everythin'. - Whose fault is that? - I'm NOT taking the blame for this! - OK. ..Let's meet. Fine. And I'll tell you where. 'Cutter's Park. Number 40.' Why there? WANNA meet? THAT'S where! One hour! Very neighbourly(!) If the Drug Squad knew Jackson was dealing, why wasn't he arrested? Too small-time to be worth it. Can be better to let them operate, so they lead you to their suppliers. They did nothing? Kept tabs on him. Stuck a couple of men in a house somewhere with a camera. What sort of house? With a good vantage point. That wouldn't be too obvious. Like that one over there? What sort of camera would they have used? A video? Stills. A telephoto lens... on a tripod... On a tripod with spikes. So there WAS a team here. Not from MY department. From Hoskins'? Then she'd have known all along. Everything that happened before the explosion. I'm sorry. If Jo Hoskins is sitting on evidence, she has her reasons. Isn't that what you're afraid of? Newman nearly had a criminal record. What do you mean, nearly? Some years ago, he was arrested on a charge of misprescribing diamorphine. He was giving away heroin. Part of some legalisation campaign. But? Charges were dropped when vital evidence went missing. Who was the officer in charge? Jo Hoskins. Tell DCI Hoskins DI Connor wants a word. I'll make an appointment. Now. DCI Hoskins has been called away urgently. Called away where? She didn't say. Who was the last person she spoke to on the phone? ..Mr Greaves. Martin Greaves. GLASS CRUNCHES UNDERFOOT SOFTLY: Martin? Why couldn't you just do what you were told?! Morning. Morning. Who found the body? We did. Looking for Jo Hoskins at the time. Didn't they tell you who it was? I was speaking to him the other day. We spoke to him yesterday. Did he say he knew Maggie Collins? Yes. Apparently, he'd slept with her. He's been suffocated. The windpipe's been crushed. It should be easy to match the murder weapon. It's left a distinctive ridge. Can I borrow that for a moment, please? Thank you. Would DCI Hoskins carry one of those? I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence... Bill, come on. You can't be serious about this. Deadly. Look, you've been out there a long time. TOO long. And that's MY fault. Bill, please! Don't do this to yourself! No-one was supposed to get hurt. I put my trust in the wrong people. ME...TOO! Please open this door. Look... She's wanted for questioning in connection with several murders, concealing evidence, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. I suggest you open it. I want all these opened. I don't have the keys to those. Fine. These are confidential. They should be inspected by a senior officer. The Chief Constable can join us(!) What's in here? Stationery. She likes to hoard paperclips? This one as well. Wait! KEYS JINGLE, CABINET IS OPENED Pass me that crowbar. You'll need a locksmith to get into it. FIND one! Sam, coming? Where to? Fred's birthday bash. Everyone's over at the Cutter's Arms. I'll try and make it. DNA results. The spit on Newman. Already? The toxicology's on your desk. Seems your killer ran out of heroin. Newman was injected with methadone. See you in the pub. PHONE RINGS Connor. There's something I need to show you... What? I said, there's something I need to show you straight away. Sam, I'll call you back. It's not Hoskins. How do you know? How do you know it's not Hoskins? Sam? Hello...? Sam? Sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. (Shit!) Not much in here frightens me. I just thought you should know that if it wasn't for you I never would've been able to make that arrest. What arrest? Hoskins. Hoskins didn't kill anyone. We recovered the attacker's saliva from Newman's body... and sent it off for DNA profiling. The lab noticed a correlation with a batch we'd sent a few weeks ago. These profiles indicate the killer was Frances Collins' father. She was a sweet kid, my Frances. That must've been hard, protecting her from your work. Impossible. I told Hoskins I wanted out. But she wouldn't let go? She said I was stressed. I needed a break. So she sent me away for a few weeks. So, while I was gone, she sent a couple of clowns over, to tell Maggie that her drug-dealing boyfriend had been busted and wasn't coming back. And she got Newman to cut off her methadone? And that Greaves geezer was supposed to relocate her. He was a bit generous with his smack. Know what I mean? So you killed them? They murdered my family. And Hoskins? Now, that would be too easy. Anyway, I just came to say thanks. We make a good team. Except you never really told me what you were doing. Sorry. It was on a "need to know" basis. A "need to know" basis. Is that how it was with Maggie Collins? You didn't tell HER you were undercover? It was safer. For all of us. Until Hoskins got to her. ..When was I supposed to tell her? When she got pregnant? When Frances was born? When? When was I supposed to tell her? And it wasn't because, in the back of your mind, you thought, "Any day I like, I can walk out of here?" No. But that's what happened. I did everything I could for them. Except you couldn't tell them the truth. DS Reynolds. It's over. Have you found Hoskins? No. Then it's NOT over. It's Reynolds, your real name, isn't it? DS William Reynolds. So what do they call you? Bill? I've seen your record. Commendations for bravery. Recommended for promotion. It's impressive. Your family didn't deserve what happened to them. But if Hoskins was to blame, she'll pay. Just tell us where she is. She let you get isolated. Compromised. Maybe you ended up thinking you stink worse than the villains you're meant to be sorting out. But you are still a copper. You were a good officer. So was Hoskins. Hoskins was rubbish. So I treated her like rubbish. So what was all that about - treating Hoskins like rubbish? There's only one way to find out. ..Oh, God... Sign there, please. HE STRAINS, FLESH TEARS Shit! He died on the way to hospital. Hoskins? He admitted he'd taken her, more or less. Didn't say where? He dropped a hint. May be a wind-up. Forensics are examining his clothes. Are you sure you're up to this? Anything you can find. I'll do my best. The subject's a male Caucasian, in his early thirties. He's been formally identified as William Reynolds, aka Andy Fox. Some green detritus under the fingernails. Get a sample there, please. Pass me a comb. Come on in, the garbage is lovely(!) Any luck? Everything brought in in the last few days is in this area. The workmen say they'd have noticed a body. IF it was all in one piece. Are you sure he wasn't taking the piss? Keep looking. Any luck? What about you? Oh, I dunno. This really isn't my preferred method of working. All these samples should've been sent off for expert analysis. No time. You're the only expert I have. Mmm... What've you found? Mould. Under his fingernails. What sort? I dunno! Possibly mildew. That was in his hair. What, exactly? Spider's eggs. ..I'm lost. Found traces of waterproof adhesive on his fingers, suggesting he bound Hoskins with tape. Somewhere damp. Or badly ventilated. We only have to check out every cellar in Cambridge(!) Why did he kill Newman with methadone, when the first two he killed with heroin? Poetic justice. The punishment had to fit the crime. Because of Hoskins, Maggie Collins OD'd. And his little girl died of thirst. I know where she is. Number 40's over here! We've got her. It's all right, Jo. Get that water now! Handcuff key! Right. Steady, steady, steady, steady. It's all right. We've got you. You're all right. You're all right. WAIL OF APPROACHING SIREN Now, maybe, you should arrest ME. Aiding and abetting. Conspiracy. Fox lied to you. He lied to everybody. If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have got to all those people. He would. Eventually. If it wasn't for you, we'd never have caught him. Is she gonna be OK? Are you? Come on. Let's get out of here.
