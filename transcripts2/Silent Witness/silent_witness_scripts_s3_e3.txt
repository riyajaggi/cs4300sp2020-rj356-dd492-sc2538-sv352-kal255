 Silent Witness (1996–…): Season 3, Episode 3 - Fallen Idol: Part 1 - full transcript 
 Gemma Boyd, an attractive 17-yr old, is found dead at the bottom of a staircase. Although the cause of death was a broken neck, there is little to indicate whether she fell or was pushed. She was found in a vacant house that her estate agent mother and step-father were selling. The autopsy reveals that Gemma had already had a child and was pregnant. The police think that Gemma's boyfriend is their man but when someone else is revealed as the father in the latest pregnancy, Sam thinks there is a far more complex set of relationships at play. Sam's sister Wyn visits from Ireland with big news: she is going to get married. Sam's relationship with James however takes an unfortunate turn and seems to come to an end.

 No, sorry. She's not here. SUZY: The sign's down. It can wait until tomorrow. Can't leave it like that - it's dangerous. The door's open. Suzy! Suzy! Christ! Gemma? My baby! We are going to be late! Don't touch her! Don't you dare touch her! ♪ Testator Sile-ens ♪ Costestes e Spiritu-um

 ♪ Silentiu-um. ♪ You're putting me off. Much as I love watching a woman in her boudoir, we're going to be late...again! I thought you hated fundraisers. I hate pretending to enjoy myself. Liar! OK, what I hate is turning up alone and being jumped on by adoring mothers. Aw! Shall I fend them off for you? You do it brilliantly. MOBILE RINGS Sam Ryan. Right. Whereabouts is that, please? You were on your way out. I still am. What have we got? It's, um, their daughter. They found her at the foot of the stairs. Is it their house? No, they're the estate agents. They found the side door open, walked in, there she was. ..Cheers. It's possible she did just fall. You don't think so? The way she's lying. Looks like she came down headfirst, but look at her shoes. Fashion victim? She's still quite warm. No obvious injuries. Apart from the broken neck(!) Apart from the scratches. A lot of broken fingernails. Her clothes are badly ripped. That could have been the fall. Nails and splinters sticking out. Thought estate agents had stopped going out alone. Well, they have guidelines now. Travel in pairs, carry rape alarms, mobile phones, the lot. But this one shouldn't have been here at all. Can you turn her? Apparently, it wasn't part of her job description to show clients round her father's houses. Yeah?  What are these for, then? Dead girl was Gemma Boyd. Paul Franklin was her stepfather. What about her mother? Suzanne. In shock. Can't get anything. Shall I take them home? Just her. I still want him. See you for the PM in the morning. You can put your lipstick back on. 'Don't worry. It'll be all right.' They said they'd be here. They will be. ..Just in time. This is Kate - one of my medical triumphs. This is Dr Ryan. Lovely to meet you. And you. We were terrible in rehearsal. You'll be fine. I better go. Break a leg. OK, so where are all the adoring mothers? They know defeat when they see it. How long had the house been empty? A couple of years, but it only came on to our books about a week ago. See if you can match these keys to any properties. Which was Gemma's desk? That one. Is this her appointments diary? No, it's mine and Suzy's. Gemma didn't have appointments. She worked in the office with me, filing... making coffee, answering the phone... She didn't even go out for lunch most days... Always on a diet. Teenagers. You wanted a picture? Nothing more recent? No. She was never a pretty baby. A little fat lump she was. You look away for a minute and they're grown up. I'm sorry. What's it gonna be like? There'll be a lot of questions... No, no... What's it gonna be like when I start to feel it? Because I can't, you know? I can't feel anything. It's the shock. Can't hear her, can't smell her... PHONE RINGS Franklin residence. 'Hello? 'Hello? Is anybody there?' PHONE BUTTONS BEEP That happened before? What? Someone ringing, but not speaking. Mrs Franklin? D'you have any idea why Gemma would have been carrying those keys? No. I can't understand it. Do they have anything in common at all? Nothing. Different locations and prices... Vendors have all moved out. So they're all empty? Yeah. Have you been having any funny phone calls lately, Mr Franklin? Not that I'm aware of. Why? Someone rang the house when I was there - a breather. 'Tell Gemma Mr Harris will meet her as arranged. 'Tell Gemma Mr Harris will meet her as arranged.' Is that him? Is that his voice? Police! Will you let go of the phone, please? Phone call to the house came from here. Think it's a stalker? He was here. THEY PLAY "Scheherazade" by Rimsky-Korsakov Not exactly the Berlin Philharmonic. It's in a good cause. Bravo! (Home in time for the news.) I didn't think it was that bad(!) Dad! Dad! What's she so upset for? She was horrible to Gemma half the time. We all need to get some sleep. HEAVY BREATHING Subject's an adult female. She was 17. 17? Well, I thought she was older. White, well-nourished, long blonde hair. Height... 5ft 8. 17? She's got a hyperpigmented streak on her abdomen and striae gravidarum on her thighs. Stretchmarks? I'm not sure yet, but she may have been a mother. That's the first I've heard about it. Are you sure? OK, not sure, but...? It's highly likely. A lot of bumps and scratches on her. She fell down a staircase with no carpets. Trevor, look at these flecks. Blood? More like paint. Possibly. The paintwork was peeling where they took the carpets up. These look more like chips of paint from a bicycle or a car or something. The lab will confirm it. OK. Thanks. It looks as though she died the same afternoon she was found. Cause of death's probably a broken neck. Likely she died instantly. Now, I have to wait for the lab results to be sure, but... the presence of what looks like semen would indicate that she'd had sexual intercourse that day. Doesn't look forced, but the internal might show more. No furniture in the house? That's right. Can't see this a girl like this risking splinters in her bum. Well, I just mean the killer isn't a boyfriend... We have no idea who or what he is. Am I supposed to go to school? Do what you bloody like. What is it? She definitely had a boyfriend of some kind. How do you know? Because Gemma Boyd was pregnant. Oh, brilliant! What are we doing for supper? ..No, thanks. Nothing. My sister's arriving. How about lunch? Sure. I'll come to you. Lovely. Has the temperature dropped several degrees in here? OK... He's rich, successful, handsome... Tall. Tall. But? I think you can do better. What is your problem with James? He's everything I can't stand about surgeons. An ego the size of Jupiter, he's cocky... And I worry about you. I know I shouldn't interfere. No-one would come to me for advice on how to construct a successful love life, but I do think you could do better. I'm a big girl, Trevor. DOORBELL Hold on a minute. Sorry. I was putting the rubbish out. So...have you found this Mr Harris yet? I was hoping you could help us. Oh, er, well... We've no clients by that name. No-one I can think of... who knew Gemma. Maybe it was somebody she met before. Before what? Well, Gemma hasn't always lived here. Oh, sorry... She came back to me about six months ago, moved in with us when Paul gave her the job. Look, um... My first husband...used to be away a lot in the Merchant Navy. When he did come home, he used to communicate with his fists. So I took Gemma and I left... Well, it wasn't easy. And I had a living to make, you know...um... So by the time I met Paul, she was living... full-time with Eileen. Eileen? Lee's mum. Who's Lee? A yob, he's a gyppo, virtually. A great big stupid bloody grin on his face - I knew he'd be trouble. Lee was Gemma's boyfriend? Yeah. Or still is, maybe...I don't know. She didn't really talk about it. I suppose she knew that I didn't really approve. She could have done so much better for herself. Did they fight? Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. Little girl is like him, poor thing. Little girl? Lee and Gemma had a baby? Yeah. She lives with him. With Lee. You have spoken to them about what's happened? No. That the best they had? Yeah. Nothing since she was 13. OK! Gemma Boyd... died in a house where she shouldn't have been, after keeping an appointment with a Mr Harris. She had keys for half a dozen houses. Executive detached - 450 grand. Studio flat - needs attention. The only connection is...? They were all empty. Maybe she's fixing up a squat. Or somewhere to meet her man. The only key that's missing is 27 Cumberland Avenue - where she died. Either Mr Harris took it, or someone else let her into the house. We have discovered this morning that Gemma Boyd was pregnant. She already had one child by a boyfriend - Lee Bennett. "A gyppo, virtually. Great big stupid bloody grin on his face." Sounds like your type(!) While Bradley's tracking down the boyfriend, I want every property on the Franklin list checked out. ..And I want you to check all incoming calls to the Franklin home and office. Bloody hell! - Plenty to wipe your bum on there! - Very funny! Find the number from which Mr Harris made this call. 'Tell Gemma Mr Harris will meet her as arranged.' 'Tell Gemma Mr Harris will meet her as arranged.' - Not a stranger. - He knows her. Anything else? Middle-aged. Local. No please or thank-you. You know what else I'm hearing? Authority. Gemma had to meet him. She had no choice. I'm sorry you had to be the one to tell me the news. Thing is, I need to speak to Lee. No... No, it's all right. I'll tell him. I mean, I need to speak to Lee formally. If you suspect Lee, you're barking up the wrong tree. It's standard procedure to talk to everyone she knew. Come here. How much time did Gemma spend here? Recently, just weekends when she wasn't working. She was with her mother's family during the week? She was grateful for that job. Paul was a bit of a leg-up for Suzanne - after the last one. What d'you make of Mrs Franklin? She was a cow. When Gemma was pregnant, she told her to get an abortion or get out. What about Lee? My son wasn't good enough for her! ..But your daddy's the best lad in the world, isn't he? I told you - Lee's out. Was he out yesterday afternoon? Er...Monday afternoon? Jobcentre - you can check. Do you wanna...see her picture? Yeah, please. ..Sit there, poppet. Mind your head. She's lovely, ain't she? Mummy... Come in. Well, now!  Give us a kiss, then! God, you look well! Well, so I should. Your hair's lovely. I like the coat. Yes, well... Give me your bag... Sam, listen... What? I'm getting married. Isn't it amazing? You're full of surprises! Well, I am going to be a June bride, June the 6th, so if you've anything on that day, cancel it! Who is it? Hmm... Billy Prior. Billy Prior? Danny's brother?! He went to Australia. He came back. He married... Finished! But you hate Billy Prior! Didn't he push you off your...? Bike. And throw your satchel in a puddle? Sam, that was 30 years ago. So has he changed much? No, he hasn't changed... Come in. Dr Ryan, this is Paul Franklin. Yes, of course. ..Sorry. OK, Mr Franklin, we're just about ready for you. Can I, er... have a few moments alone with her? I'm sorry - it's not permitted during a murder investigation. Oh... While we're here, why don't we do the blood test? What blood test? It's routine under the circumstances. Dr Ryan can do it. I'll wait outside. See you later. After you. I need your consent to take a blood test to establish paternity of Gemma's baby. I see.  Is that OK? All the men she knew will be tested? Yeah. Mmm. OK, Doctor. I'm all yours. How far was she, er...? I don't think I'm at liberty to say. No...I suppose not. You OK? Yeah, I'm fine, fine... Please... Go ahead. Clench your fist for me, please. Oh, this is pointless. You'd... I can ask someone else to be with you if you're worried about the needle. It's not the needle. This is just such a... waste of time... There. It's all done. Press down on this swab, please. We should know the results of the tests in a couple of days. You don't need a result. You know as well as I do who the father of Gemma's baby was. Don't you? We're all done.  Thanks. ..Can you come down to the station? I'd like to take a proper statement. I don't think... Is he OK? I think you'll have to wait for your statement. What's the problem? He didn't like the needle. Hi! This bloody book - wish I hadn't started it. Is your sister here? Waltzed in and said she's getting married. How many husbands is that? This is her first. Marvellous. You can be a bridesmaid. I'm starving. Let's go. I met her, you know. Who? Your dead girl - Gemma. Did you? I realised this morning. The whole family came to Kate's last rehab session. I liked her - kind as well as pretty. And not a patient. Mmm. You got it! VIOLIN PLAYS Where have you been? Just the office, that's all. Funny. I rang. You weren't there. Kate! Come downstairs and get some lunch. VIOLIN STOPS BANGING AND DOORBELL What now? I know you're in there! I know you're in there! I don't want you! I want her! Right... Interview with Lee Bennett. Present DS Bradley, PC Clive, Mr Blake. Time now... How would you like it?! Finding out from a policeman! ..Anything you do say... Treating us like muck! Listen... I'll kill her next time! ..Something you later rely on in court. Lee...why did you go to Paul Franklin's house today? Gemma didn't like me going there. She said it just caused trouble with her mum. You don't like her mum? She grassed me up when Gemma was pregnant. I got cautioned for unlawful sexual intercourse, thanks to Suzanne Franklin. How old were you then? 15. Did you and Gemma meet at the houses Paul Franklin was selling? We'll find out anyway. You have to say it out loud. Yes! But just to chat. I don't want you thinking... What? Well, that we did it. It? Had sex. Because we never - not in other people's houses, not with all their furniture. Did you meet Gemma yesterday afternoon at 27 Cumberland Ave? No. You sure? I never killed her! You will never get me to say that I killed her! Did you know Gemma was pregnant? Was she? Was it your baby? Of course it was mine! Who else's could it have been? What are you saying? What are you saying? Suspect is banging the table. What are you saying? He's a liar! ..What are you saying? Kate? - How does the arm feel? - Feels good to me. I have someone claiming paternity. And he is?  Lee Bennett. Father of her first child. Interesting. There are no real defence wounds on her. Her nails are broken, but there's only splinters of wood from the stairs under them. I asked you over because of the shoes. What about them? If she'd been wearing them when she fell, I'd expect to find bruising on the feet or abrasions on the buckles, but there's nothing. If she wasn't wearing them, how did they get down the stairs? There's a mark on her throat. He hit her with her shoe? Not exactly. Look at this heel. This could do serious damage in the hands of a determined attacker. That didn't have that much force. I think this just landed on her. It's like the killer just threw these down the stairs after her. One... two. Did you know she was pregnant? No. So what was the fight about? What do you mean? If it wasn't about her being pregnant, what was it about? He was threatening my wife. Why would he want to do that? Inspector...why don't you get to the point? Where is the key to 27 Cumberland Ave? In my safe. Was it you who let Gemma into the house? Yes. I knew the house would be empty and quiet, so I arranged to meet her there. She was late. I was worried. When she arrived, we went upstairs and talked. Then I left. Drove away. You don't want to leave at the same time in case people see. Now tell me the part you missed out. We didn't argue, if that's what you mean. How did she fall, then? I don't know. I wasn't there. When I left...Gemma was standing at the top of the stairs... ..looking down at me... like an angel... 17! What? She was 17 and your stepdaughter. You'll have to do better than that! I'm sorry. It's just that your morals don't interest me. Were you in love with her? Yes. Was it your baby? I believe so. Mmm... Did you kill her? No. Trevor would say there's no man good enough for either of us. I said to him, "Even with Sam's terrible taste in men..." Unfair. If I'm getting a new brother-in-law, I hope you brought photos. He doesn't take much of a photo. No defensive speeches now. No need. He's lovely. You'll like him. Sam...who's that? You're not supposed to be here. Be a lot easier to swap keys. I could've chilled the champagne. Here's a spare set for my house. ..You must be Wyn. I'm James. Hello. Congratulations on your news. Let me do that. You take them. I'll do it. Listen, this is Wyn's first night. We've a lot of catching up to do. I'll be quiet. Go on. You can survive without me for one evening. What if Paul Franklin found out Gemma was just using him to set up a series of love nests with Mr Harris? It's a perfectly good motive, but it works both ways, doesn't it? I mean, you're Mr Harris and you find out your girl's having an affair with her stepfather. I'd kill him, not her. It's DC Wright here from the East Anglia Police. Are you the owner of a house in Walker Street? She's gone where? Florida? SHE HUMS A TUNE You haven't been back to the property? Yeah. Thanks very much. Two phone calls made last week from an empty house. Where? Walker St. SIRENS WAIL Not exactly my idea of a love nest. The bastard! He did know her. That your dead girl? Gemma. Pretty. Who's the other woman? Her mother. You're kidding? MUFFLED CHAT She knew. What do you think you're doing? Put it down. Just what gives you the right to mess about with her things? Give it to me. She always let me. Well, Gemma's not here now and I forbid it! She hated you. Don't you dare talk to me like that, you spoilt little cow! Ow! You're hurting me! I really tried to make this work. All three of you ganged up on me! I'll tell Daddy! Tell your precious daddy! He'll look after you! Your daddy'll sort you out! Just like he sorted out my Gemma! Stop it! Leave me alone! You're frightening me! You should be bloody frightened! He's got both of them? Not without a fight. Looks like it started in the kitchen then spilled out here. I think he then got both of them outside and into Mrs Franklin's car. So, there's no body. No. I called you out to see if you could make anything of these blood stains. You got a weapon? One of her own knives is gone. Right. No sprays, so there's no arterial injury. There's a lot of blood. From superficial injuries, I think. This pool of blood here - it indicates an injured person fell or sat down, for some time. And these towels? Someone tried to staunch the bleeding. Or tried to help. I don't agree with you that the fight spilled out into the hall. I think they were walking to the door. Walking wounded, then. They'd better get to a doctor soon. We've got the hospitals covered. Do you think it's the same man that killed Gemma Boyd? Mr Harris? We've found his hiding place. But you're too late? Too late twice, now. There's been an incident at your house tonight. Incident? What do you mean, "incident"? You've had me locked up all night, and left my family unprotected! We're making every effort to find them. Now he's got them too. Kate. He's got Kate, hasn't he? Bloody brilliant detective work this is(!) Whoever killed Gemma, may have some grudge against you... I tell you... OR YOUR DAUGHTER OR... If anything happens to my wife... ..YOUR WIFE. ..then YOU will be held responsible. The only person I can see with a grudge against us is you, Inspector. You're bailed to return in two weeks. I want my family back... and I want to go home. Sam? What are you doing out here? Aren't you going to come in? What about the stepmother? I hadn't taken much notice. Did they seem happy? Like a family? Sam, it was her broken bones I was there to look at, not her home life. I thought Suzy Franklin was nice enough. Bit prickly. Bit of a new wife. How do you mean? All over him. Do you think she'd be the sort to panic? There's nothing we can do except wait. It's 12.05am. Five minutes too late to mention work. Besides, there's something I want to talk to you about. Oi! This tosser says I can't have my bike back. How do I get home at this time of night? You've got legs, haven't you? It's 11 bloody miles! You want to treat people with a bit more respect. I've been locked up for nothing. My mum and the baby at home - all upset. And Gemma's dead and we didn't even know. Because that cow Suzy wouldn't tell us! Yeah, but we're lowlife. We don't count. I've heard this speech. I hope you've told Mick! - There'll be hell to pay. - Mick, who's Mick? - Mick Boyd, Gemma's dad. There IS no Mr Harris. What? We're looking for Mick Boyd - Suzy's ex-husband. He's supposedly in the Merchant Navy. Gemma's father? Found him? Coming up now. Boyd, Michael Alexander. DOB 7.3.58, Lowestoft. He's a record as long as your arm! Seven years for aggravated burglary in 1994. Asked for five other offences to be considered. When did he get out? Released...three weeks ago. She was looking for somewhere to put him up. Rent free. Track down his probation officer. Still nothing from the hospitals? No. What the bloody hell has he done with them? Helen? I'm sorry, have I woken you up? 'What time is it?' God, it's past midnight. I'm sorry. 'It's OK.' How's David? 'Fast asleep, last time I looked.' 'What is it, Michael?' I was just wondering if... You haven't been up yet. I thought that you and David should come and spend a weekend here. 'I don't know. I'm really busy and... Do we have to discuss this now?' I miss you. I'll call you some other time. 'Yeah, OK.' Good night. PHONE CUTS OFF You get a six-month sabbatical in a world-class surgical centre... You get six months in California! You're asking me to drop everything to go to Stanford... and hang on your arm at faculty parties? You're a successful woman, you can afford to take time off. You just don't see it, do you, James? I see a woman with a job and no life. I have the life I worked hard for. I don't need to run away from it. Sam... FRANTIC KNOCKING ON DOOR Coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! Kate! You've got to come, come now! NOW! Calm down - tell me what's wrong. Is she hurt? PLEASE! You've got to come! Here. Put that round you. NO! NO! Make her stop. GIRL SOBS HYSTERICALLY Mrs Franklin, I'm a doctor. Oh... Well, you're a bit late, aren't you? DON'T MOVE! DON'T YOU COME ANYWHERE NEAR ME! Who did you say you were? I'm a doctor. Doctor Ryan. MAKE THAT BLOODY CHILD SHUT UP! Mrs Franklin, are you hurt? Self-defence. That's what it was. Would you like me to let you get out of the car? My daughter was the image of him. Every time I looked at her, I could see him there. Is he dead? Yes. SHE MOANS I'm wet! Look at me, I'm all wet. I'm all wet. I paid him back, though, didn't I? He got what he deserved. SIREN You're safe now. Let's go home, Sam. It's getting cold. In a minute. Hi, Kate. How're you doing, Kate? He's really dead, isn't he? That's why you're here. Yeah. He's dead. It's nothing to be scared of. I didn't want him to die. It's OK. You did everything you could. Mr Reynolds. I'm going to have to talk to Kate, and because of her age, an adult has to be there. I was wondering, as you seemed close... For God's sake, it's 1am! Well, I meant tomorrow. I'm operating tomorrow. Look, I haven't got time to get any more involved in this. If it's not convenient, I'll find somebody else. OK, of course, tomorrow. Yes. Thank you. Why did you say that? You know what my deadlines are like. She's your patient. Look, I said I'd do it, didn't I? I'm sorry. It's cold, we're both tired, let's go home, Sam. No. I want to stay. You go. DOOR OPENS I thought we had burglars. It's only me. What kind of time is this to come in at, anyway? Oh, God. Listen to me, I sound just like "Mummy"! Camomile! Have we no proper tea? Have I run out? I'd forgotten what living with you was like. With Billy, it's all newspapers and beer cans. Years ago it would have driven me nuts. It's all compromise, is that it? Sam...are you OK? A long night. You haven't FINISHED with him? I don't believe it! I just don't think it's going to work out. None of us are ever good enough for you, are we? You know your trouble? You're too choosy. You want perfect - and it does not exist. That's a disappointment, Wyn. Not a tragedy. The subject is a man of around 40, lean but well-nourished. Length? 6ft. Blond hair, tattoos on the right arm... There are a number of knife wounds visible on the body, five of which are deep. The wounds all appeared to have been caused by the same knife, which had - a serrated edge... Photo please. The largest is on the upper thigh and measures... ..6cm. Big enough to cause him to bleed to death. I don't know about that. All the wounds are superficial. She said it was self-defence. The wounds are consistent with an attack of flailing about in panic. But even this big cut hasn't caught an artery. I'll check the kidneys and liver for confirmation, but... But no wound would have killed him, except in the absence of medical help. That's my feeling, yeah. They're 15 minutes to the infirmary, and Reynold's place is even closer. What are you saying? That she DID have time to get him to hospital. So...we may not be looking at manslaughter any more? No. It could be murder. I've got no sense of direction, ask my husband. When you left the house, did you intend to take him to hospital? I must have done, mustn't I? Did you...or didn't you? I was with Mick Boyd... for the best part of ten years. And every minute of every hour of that time, I was afraid. And when Kate went to the door last night, cos it was Kate that went, not me - poor little cow - and there he was in my house, howling and yammering like a madman, it was just like I went right back there. Right back into the pit. That's why you stabbed him? Yes. Why you also didn't take him straight to the hospital? Yes. And kept him in the car until he died. Mick Boyd came back from the dead last night. And if it's my fault that he's back where he belongs, then I didn't plan it, but I'm bloody glad I did it. You will be charged with murder, Mrs Franklin. He killed my daughter. He killed Gemma! What was I supposed to do? She told him. Told him what? She told him that she was pregnant. By her stepfather! LOUD SOBBING OK, interview terminated, 09.03am. It's only for a couple of days, till your house is cleaned up. Sorry, I know it's a bit, um... No, it's just my kind of place. It reminds me of where I grew up. Your dad's here. Close your eyes. Is there any hot water? There's an immersion heater. Suzy, we have to talk. I think I'll have a bath. I can come back later if it's a problem. Look, I am in a terrible rush. I'm DS Bradley. Can't you make an appointment? I just wanted some background on a client. Is it a bad time? They're ALL bad times! Hi, it's Jan here. I'm running late. See you in court in half an hour? Which client? Mick Boyd. What's he done? He's just out! He's dead. And he killed his daughter. Gemma? Do you know her? He talked about her. When did this happen? Day before yesterday. When? About 4pm. He talked about her? All the time, but if she died when you say, it can't have been Mick that killed her. Well, how do you make that out? Because, Sergeant, he was here. Christ! A routine interview - to get him resettled into the community. Pick up the bloody phone! We're right back to square one. It's Doctor Ryan. My dead suspect has just come up with the perfect alibi. 'Hope you've good news.' The DNA results confirm Gemma was pregnant by her stepfather. Is that meant to surprise me? You knew that yesterday, didn't you? 'Paul Franklin told you, when you did the blood test.' Yes. You couldn't break your professional silence(!) I didn't call to review my ethics. How can I help you, Doctor Ryan? I sent two samples for DNA analysis. 'The embryo and the semen aren't the same. Gemma was carrying Paul Franklin's baby... 'And?' She last had sex with Lee Bennett. He's not here! Where is he? He's been strange since he came home from your nick. He thinks Gemma was expecting again. She was. Did he say he didn't see Gemma, the day she died? That's right. Trouble is, he did, Mrs Bennett. He lied to you. I don't believe you. Don't tell me again you don't know where he is. Even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you. Oi! Sarge, I've got him! COCK CROWS I'm ready to talk now. Running away makes you look guilty! I'm fed up with them! Makes you look like a bloody liar! I'm not, though! Well, why did you say you didn't see Gemma the day she died? I didn't want you worrying! Look at you - you're 19, a father and you're sat there like some snotty-nosed kid! For God's sake, you're a grown man! I'm going to ask the council for a house for me and Dana. Why will they give you one? I'm a single-parent family. I look after her! You never lift a bloody finger! You don't let me. You always say I'm a useless sod! - When I come near her, you fuss. - If you'd got off your arse and got a job! She's mine, you know. There's nothing to stop me taking her from you. I could go down for life. I'll help you as much as I can at court. Oh? Well, a solicitor for a start. I'll get you a proper one. One with the right sort of expertise. One who can get me off a murder charge, you mean? It'll be knocked down to manslaughter, you'll see. Don't worry, Suzy. I'll make sure you're taken care of. Do you know what I felt when I stuck that knife in? Relief! Amazing, isn't it? Relief. Cos if it was Mick who killed Gemma, it meant it couldn't be you. Course it wasn't me! It's funny how much you think, locked in some stinking, little cell. I know! No, you know nothing. CLATTER We're ready for you now. She's still lovely. Come closer if you like. I'll say this for her, she was always kind to Lee. They'd been together a long time? Yeah. It was obvious she wanted to finish it. She just wouldn't say so straight out. It's hard for him. They think my son killed her. What do you think? He never lied to me before. It's best he tells everything to the police. You know that? If you know where he is... you should say. But he's my son. Then, help him. Help him tell the truth. 'We know you were the last person to have sex with her.' - Lee? - I was supposed to meet Gemma at lunchtime. I waited around the corner so her parents wouldn't see. She didn't come. I was worried. After a bit, I looked in the window and Paul Franklin comes out and tells me that Gemma's off sick. - I was worried, so I went round. - To Cumberland Avenue? No, I keep telling you. To Gemma's house! She answered the door and said she was feeling better, but... That's when you knew she was pregnant, isn't it? She said it wasn't true. Y'know, I was making it up. But I knew, yeah. I remember what she was like with Dana. What happened next? We'd never done it in her mum's house before. It just seemed like a bit of a laugh. Till Suzy came home and caught us! She comes marching in without knocking, grabbed hold of my hair, pulled me off like I was a dog! Look, I know Gemma's dad was a hard man - I'd seen him riled - but I'll tell you what... What? Boyd wasn't the scary one in that family. I did it all for you! You did it all for yourself. How can you say that? You saw Gemma as a burden, and you saw me as a meal ticket. What about you? What did you see when YOU looked at Gemma? Please don't. You abused her. And you betrayed me. I'm not proud of what I did, Suzy. But she was an adult. 17! Yeah, and how old was she when you pushed her out, eh? Telling her she didn't have a home any more? She was 13 years old - she was pregnant. A child. 'Hi, it's Doctor Ryan. Any news on those paint tests I ordered?' Doing them now. ..Yeah. Give me about 20 minutes. OK. Well, it should confirm an idea I've already got. I tried a sample in acetone - it dissolved. Yep. Here's the spectrum. And it confirms the presence of nitrocellulose. Not paint at all, then. Nope. Nail varnish? KNOCK AT DOOR Come in. Hello, Sam. Look, I'm sorry about last night, I don't know what got into me. You were cold and tired. And I wanted to get home - with you. Any idea when you're leaving, yet? Eh, six weeks. What do you think? How about it? I've, er, brought your keys back. Bit of an over-reaction, this, don't you think? No, I don't think so. One mistake and now I'm a total bastard? Kate heard you. All Kate heard was a tired, fed up man. I heard you. Anyway, let's...not have this fight. Let's walk away as friends, yeah? Why? You're not being honest with me. Any risk of getting closer, and you're on the run. I wanted someone who was clever and undemanding, someone who wouldn't break my heart. But it wasn't enough. So, what are you waiting for? At your age. I never sat by the phone, waiting for you to ring. I never wondered where you were... what you were doing... who you were with... I never needed you, James. Mrs Franklin, you've already been charged with murdering Michael Boyd. Yes. Today, I'd like to talk to you about the death of your daughter, Gemma. OK. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention something which you later rely upon in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. What happened on Monday afternoon? Um... Well, I went back to the house... after lunch...to pick up a file, and I found her there with Lee Bennett. I couldn't believe it. I threw him out - and that's when she told me about Paul. When she told me she was pregnant with my husband's child. You didn't believe her. No, that's what's so awful - I did. I did believe her, I knew. I knew she was right, I'd seen him looking. I didn't want to have to start all over again. What happened then, Mrs Franklin? Well, we had, um... It was just a silly, scrappy... well, fight I suppose you'd call it. And I grabbed her by the hair and shook her. Were you wearing nail varnish? Yeah, I always wear it. Anyway, she...she, um...didn't fight back. She just gave me this look. I said, "I don't want your pity, you little whore. "Brush your hair before you go out on the street." And she left. Said she was going to tell Paul. The last thing I said was, "Brush your bloody hair." Her lovely hair. SCALES BEING PLAYED ON PIANO Oh, hello. Have you come for the concert? Do you think I killed her? Did you? I was never a very good mother to Gemma, but no, Inspector, I did NOT kill my daughter. But you were wearing nail varnish. Yes. Was it this one? Baby Blue Eyes? That's probably one of Gemma's. It's not yours? Well, no, I mean, it's sort of blue, isn't it? I'm 38. That's what the young girls wear. Oh, he said I had to scrub it off. Mr Jarvis. The conductor? Yeah. He said it wasn't suitable for the concert, but I think it looks great. It used to look really good on Gemma. Why don't you tell me about her? SHE SOBS I pulled her hair. I didn't mean to. What did you see, Kate? See? I didn't SEE anything. I heard. I heard Gemma telling Suzy. She said Dad... And Suzy was screaming. I went and sat in the garden so I couldn't hear, then Gemma came out, so I followed her. I just wanted to know! I don't think she saw me cos she was crying. The next thing I knew, she'd gone in there - in that house. And I kept looking at this car outside, and hoping it wasn't my dad's, only it was. Then I went in... Did you go upstairs? No, I heard them from downstairs. You heard them making love? No! NO! Kate? No, I didn't! He was crying. I could hear him crying. I don't understand. I've never heard him cry. When my mum was ill he never, even when she died, but Gemma made him. Gemma said, "I don't want you, I don't love you," and he cried. And I wanted to say, "But I love you and I want you," but he ran away. He ran down the stairs, crying. I'm sorry. I must have pushed her, mustn't I? I don't really remember. Only, Gemma was lying there at the bottom of the stairs and... I did something really horrible. Her shoes. You threw her shoes down on top of her.
