 Don't know what's being misunderstood Missiles flying, children getting shot Swindles everywhere People who should be the most loved ones killing each other Once you keep an eye off, things get stolen The world is like this, the world we don't know, the unknown world Out of our hands it don't matter, covering it up, acting like you don't see a thing If you think it's a different thing you won't notice that the world You live in is eventually heading towards this matter Look at it Oh yeah! The world is all linked together

 Save our loved ones and the world Hey, hey, because breaking down the piled wood castle is easy Save our loved ones and the world Hey, hey, because breaking down the piled wood castle is easy These peaceful days lasting is a wish Hey, hey, these peaceful days continuing is just like a wish Because I have no idea how many tickets "to live today" are left Because I have no idea how many tickets "to live today" are left Even at the time when you were playing cards Somewhere in the world, somebody is crying We have some questions regarding a number of corpses found in the park. Put your hands behind your head and get on the ground! Just as I'm finally free after killing my annoying companions... But still, you've gone through the trouble of gathering here, so to get myself back up to speed... Sir, look! The wind is heading toward her!

 What the...? What is that light? Antimatter. You've never seen it, have you? What is that?! Too far! I went too far! What a feeling... The outside world sure is fun! A Sudden Reunion Mount Tsuyugamine exploded? The mountain was really a volcano? No, I've never heard that... My beacon? It came off when Valkyria got me? Now's my chance. The heck is this?! What's the matter, Kazumi-san? Mt. Tsuyugamine Erupts, Over 100 Dead or Missing Mt. Tsuyugamine Erupts, Over 100 Dead or Missing A mountain erupted?! To pull off something like this... Don't tell me! Is it Valkyria?! Yes. I'm sure of it. Valkyria? Valkyria is the ultimate hybrid. She can use eight types of magic. That many?! But still, they've been keeping her in stasis deep inside the lab. Why would she be outside? They may have learned where we are. If someone like that showed up, no strategy in the world could save us! Ichijiku, how do you intend to atone for this grave error? Did you see that giant explosion? It is now impossible to handle this situation quietly. I've turned a blind eye to some of your mistakes, but I never dreamed you were this incompetent. You could take your own life here and now, and it still wouldn't compensate for this. We will contact you later. I had such high hopes for you. What a pity. I swear... Why are there eight observatories in this area alone? Valkyria has the ability to detect witches... Huh. Four witches are all hiding out at that observatory, huh? Not that I care or anything. I wonder if there really are witches at some observatory. I hope this observatory isn't a bust, too. Otherwise, it's gonna sting. Excuse me! If you don't mind, I'll- What... Huh?! What happened? You okay? Just hold on! The heck? You're not Valkyria! Huh? Well, that was dumb. All clear, guys! Huh?! Was there a point to this? Of course there was! If Valkyria came and saw us dead from lack of medicine, she'd have to pack up and leave! I wouldn't die from lack of medicine... Think about it! If you were the only one alive, you'd be killed right away! I see you're as crude as ever, Kazumi. Huh? Whoa, hey! It's Hatsuna! So, you know her? Yes. She's a friend from back at the lab. The lab? Wait a sec. If an A-rank like you is coming here... It was orders from the lab. I was sent with Valkyria to recover No. 1107. Huh?! You came with Valkyria? Relax. Valkyria went off somewhere else. R-really? Yeah. Thank goodness. That was a close one. What is "No. 1107"? Beats me. I don't know the details of the operation. I only found this place by sheer chance. Who is that guy? He's been helpin' us. You're okay with that? Getting some human involved? Yeah, this guy's fine. He's even prepared to die for us. It's fine when I say it myself, but don't you go saying it! Huh. Prepared to die? Anyway... Who are you? I've never seen you. R-r-r-right! Last name Takatori, first name Kotori! I'm very glad to meet you! This girl doesn't know Kotori? Hatsuna. Hm? You don't have any pills on you, do you? Uh, no. Ah, jeez. So that's why you came here, huh? That puts a bigger strain on things. "Strain"? Well it is, right? You got a problem or something? It's just... When I first met you, you flat-out refused to share your medicine, didn't you? You've changed, Kazumi. S-so what if I have?! Well... No, it's fine. Hey, I want to go to the hot spring. And get this paint off of me. There's a hot spring here? Yeah! What do you say we go take a bath? Murakami, you clean the floor before we get back. Huh?! Wow... This is a great place. But Kazumi, you still have sad little boobs, huh? Wh-what the hell?! Meanwhile, this one's are indecently big. Please don't be so rough with them! What are you supposed to be? A boob critic? Hatsuna-Chan. What's that scar from? Oh. Valkyria hurt me bad, and I'm not healed yet. But by tomorrow, my breasts will be pretty again. Hatsuna-san, what is your magic? Healing. Healing! You can try and kill me, but I won't die. Not even if my head gets crushed. Running out of pills or being ejected would do it, though. Wow. That's amazing! So, you were all saved by that Murakami guy? Yes, that's right. If not for Murakami-kun... we'd have all died long ago. You really trust him, huh? I guess. You'll get it once you spend some time with him. Well, then... I'll take my time and size him up. That felt great. Hey! Hey! Please help me! What the heck are you doing?! I climbed up thinking I'd get a good view, but now I'm scared and can't get down! Help me! Okay. Wait right there! Jeez... What the hell? Girl, you really need to cut the crap. He actually came. Huh? Oh, nothing at all. Let's go down. Can you stand? Yeah. Give me a damn break already! I just took a bath, but now I'm all sweaty! Do not let go of my hand! I'll get us out of this. Yup. You pass. If you'd go this far, you're as good a guy as they say. Let me go. I have healing magic. Even falling from here won't kill me. You can get back to the platform if you use both hands, right? Don't be stupid! Huh? Falling from here won't kill you? Who on Earth would believe that?! Um, I could seriously fall from here and I wouldn't die. If what you're saying is true, that would explain why you've been acting like a weirdo. You wanted to test me, huh? Exactly. So let go of my hand! Forget it. Huh? You could be telling a lie to save me. You're over-thinking this! Listen. Even if we both fall, I'm not letting go of you! Then what do we do? At this rate, we'll both... I'll swing you over to that platform! Huh? You might not reach it, or you might not land properly... But it's 100 times better than just dropping you! Once my hand is free, I'll climb back along this pipe. And what if the pipe breaks from you swinging me? Screw it! My arms are about to give out. There's no time to think. I'll swing you twice, then throw you on three. Here goes! One! Two! Three! Oh, man! I thought I was gonna die! Well, even falling wouldn't have killed me, but... Thank you! You should... Oh, no! Did it! Murakami-kun! You okay? Ow... The heck? Why am I alive? Did you see the power of my magic? Kana had a prediction that you'd fall. I'm glad we made it in time. So when Kotori uses her switching magic, kinetic energy gets reset? Otherwise, one of us would've gone splat. Huh? What do you mean? No way! You didn't even know?! The heck just happened? Was it that chesty girl's magic? Anyway, I don't believe it. A human like that exists... Say, what is that girl's magic? It's healing. Apparently, she just won't die. So then she was telling the truth. I'm sorry. It was wrong of me to test you. I'm really sorry. We're both alive, so it's fine. I... I... I think I like you. What? Do you have a girlfriend? If not, I'll go out with you. Huh?! What are you, a dummy? What're you talking about?! Well, I've fallen for him. So then... It's only natural to kiss you, right? Neko! N..N..Neko-san! You mustn't do that. Please calm down. Whatever! It wasn't me! Neko-san! Ah! Kuroha, wait! Huh? Wait up, Murakami! Now I get it. So that's how relationships here work... Sorry to suddenly call you out here. That's fine. I feel bad about what happened to that girl. Kogoro? So, you still remember Nanami? Yes. I remained outside her field of vision. So then, you understand? If we don't get more pills, the other four will... They'll melt to death, like Nanami. That's why I called you here. Don't tell me you've made more pills! Let's not be so hasty. I'll explain in order. Oh. Yeah... First, as for why the witches melt... I suspect it's because their bodies produce a digestive enzyme called protease. "Digestive enzyme"? Those pills may halt protease production. An acquaintance from my school days wrote his thesis on protease. If we build on the existing analytical data, I expect we can dramatically shorten the time needed to create the pills. So then...! We can complete it in another month. A month? Then there's no point! Between the five of them, there's only enough for a week. Then you must make a choice. A choice? Don't tell me...! The person who wrote this was a true genius. Research on Membrane-Bound Protease Protein The University of Tokyo, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology Sakai Lab Chisato Ichijiku (70119) The person who wrote this was a true genius. Research on Membrane-Bound Protease Protein The University of Tokyo, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology Sakai Lab Chisato Ichijiku (70119) Research on Membrane-Bound Protease Protein The University of Tokyo, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology Sakai Lab Chisato Ichiiku (70119) I have only one goal: To unravel the mystery of life. I will make any sacrifice toward that end. Even if it means trading all the lives in this world. Ichijiku... Where are you, and what are you up to? This wonderful view is all mine! Because I'll kill anyone who gets in my way! Why did you do something that brazen, Valkyria? Rather... Mako Fujisaki? My dear... You've been terrible to me, haven't you? All those cruel experiments... You robbed me of my humanity! That is... my job. You're not scared of me? I want vengeance on you so badly that I can't stand it. You know that, don't- Why did you use antimatter like that? Y-you would strike me?! I... I'm sorry, Chisato! Please, you mustn't hate me! My love! I've been waiting for you here, just like we promised! You've learned where No. 1107 is, haven't you? Neko. Kogoro asked Murakami to see him today, right? Yes. Something must be wrong with me. When I think of Murakami-kun, my chest hurts so much... Murakami! Did that old guy get a break in his research? Yes. Huh? Are you serious? So, what progress has he made? It looks like he can really shrink the time it takes to make the pills, but it will still take another month. Huh? That's no friggin' use to us at all! It seems we're already dead, huh? That's not true, is it? If the remaining pills went to just one of us, she alone could be saved. So then, just one... can survive? This is the choice that Kogoro mentioned. Okay. We'll draw lots. The lottery will decide who lives. Everyone who loses dies tomorrow. You all prepared for that? If we're going to do it, we should do it as soon as possible. The pills won't last. Huh. Then everyone talk it over first. I'm just taking your handouts, so I have no right to participate. If you'll excuse me. The heck's with you? Not a team player, are you? 23, 24... Not quite enough, huh? I'm not such a sucker that I would tell them the whole story. The truth is, I still have the pills from my friends that Valkyria killed. I thought I could get more if I came here... but I guess not, huh? I don't need to draw, either. I don't need the pills. If someone else can live long enough to grow old, then I'd prefer that. What are you talking about? How can you be modest when your life's on the line?! I thought she'd say something like that. Me, too. I don't need to draw, either. I should have died long ago, so... I'm fine, too. After all, I couldn't survive on my own. We're fine. Kazumi-Chan, you should live. Please, go ahead. Wh-what the hell is that? Now it looks like I'm the only one who's desperate to live! Sure, I wanna live, but... I can't cut your lives short to do that! I'd rather just enjoy this week, our last summer vacation, together. Kazumi... Kazumi-Chan! So this is their decision, huh? Then all that's left is this device... At this rate, we should toast. A toast to our last summer vacation! Kotori, can you bring some juice? O-okay! Sorry to keep you waiting! Are you okay, Kotori-Chan? Y-yes! What're you doing?! I-I'm sorry! Please take this off before it stains! I-I'm sorry! Neko-san, you're not wearing a bra either? Well, I didn't have a spare... Kuroha, those moles... Huh? What do you mean, "moles"? You... You are Kuroneko! Murakami-kun? Neko is... Murakami's childhood friend? You're alive. Kuroneko, you're alive! I always loved Kuroneko. She liked the stars, so I grew to like them, too. It was fun to look up at the sky together every night. I thought we'd keep doing it forever. But... But then, I thought I'd killed her. I thought I'd never see her again. But... she was alive! You were alive! Murakami-kun? Murakami-kun! What's the matter, Murakami-kun? Murakami-kun! Uh, sorry to have cried like that. The moles weren't in the same place as before, so I thought that you weren't Kuroneko. But over 10 years, your body grew and the moles must have shifted. This proves it. You're my childhood friend, Kuroneko. I'm sorry. Huh? I don't remember a single thing about my childhood. Don't worry about that. I remember everything. From the day we met, to the fun we had every day. The places we went, conversations we had. I remember it all. So, even if you've forgotten, I never will. Let's fill in your missing memories together! I'll remember everything that happens going forward, too. A helicopter out this late? It's coming this way! Everybody, run! A helicopter's after us! Huh? Wh-wh-what should we do? We'll run to the mountains! We'll be hard to find at night. She looks just like Kuroha! Don't tell me she's...! It's been a while, Neko. I look up at the twinkling stars How I've always been enchanted by them Tomorrow, while having a dream I'll try being in love By asking for that which I don't have Everyone has their own happiness You taught me that, didn't you? I love that about you... Say... I've now fallen in love I asked the first star of night That somehow I could always be with you I know now for the first time Love is heartrending It brings pain But love is so very Look Something so warm OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
