 There are two things I'd like your help with. One is copying this pill. And what is this? Medicine that keeps the witches alive. Explain from the beginning, so I can understand. Right. It all started with a transfer student. I was about to be killed in a mudslide, but she used her magic to save me. The witch seemed exactly like an old friend who died 10 years ago because of me... She looked just like Kuroneko. Fragments of Hope

 I see. I get the general idea. But from what I've heard so far, they sound like physically altered super beings rather than witches. So, is it possible? To copy this medicine? It will be a chore, but not impossible. Really?! Yes. First, we'll pinpoint the active ingredients and analyze their molecular structure. Then we'll look for a way to synthesize them. And how much time will that take? Let's see... About six months, if we're lucky. If it has an intricate molecular structure, it could take several years. Half a year? Or several?! How many pills do you have left? A month's worth.

 Then it's impossible. Just give up. No, wait... If the active ingredients are crystalline compounds, then... "Then"?! Determining their molecular structure will be simple. If we mobilize all the research students, we might synthesize it within a month. You mean it?! We'll know if it's crystalline in as early as a day. I'll contact you once we have the results. So, what was the other favor? Ah. I want you to see what's in here. What is it? Supposedly, a fertilized alien egg. Oh? First witches and now aliens, huh? I don't believe it a hundred percent either... but that's what she was told when she got it. I want you to learn what's really in there. Very well. I'll hang on to this. By the way, Neko, what happened with the pills? They won't know until they examine it... Well, yeah, that makes sense. I hope they can make the pills. If we could make as many pills as we need, my dream might just come true. This "dream" of yours has to do with sex, doesn't it? That's enough outta you. Be quiet! In any case... It's all thanks to Murakami that there's even hope we can live. Well, yeah. He may be a stuck-up, annoying little jerk... but without him, we would've all died a long time ago. Yes, that's right. But still... is it okay to keep relying on him like this? Not to worry. He's smitten with Neko. Huh? No, that's not it. It's his childhood friend that Murakami likes. I just look like her. But it's not me. Hyaaaaaa! Yo, Murakami! What are you doing?! Nothing much. I saw a head that looked whackable, so I whacked it. Good morning. You're really... See ya later! Must be nice, Murakami. Gettin' to chat with Kazumi Schlierenzauer-san... What? How so? Every time she opens her mouth, she says something perverted. How would we know that?! She rarely talks to any other guy but you. Just so you know, the guys are all super jealous of you. So, hey, Kuroha-san. We're all going to karaoke today. Wanna come with us? Huh? U-um, well... Okay. Really? That's great! Okay, we'll meet at the station at 6:00 tonight. Wear regular clothes, okay? U-understood. Say, what is maramuke? "Maramuke"? Kashiwagi-san invited me to maramuke after school. Ah. Then it's not "maramuke": It's karaoke. Karaoke? It's songs with no vocals, so you do the singing. Songs? What should I do? I can't sing any songs. Sure you can. Huh? Like before. "She's here! She's dashing! It's the Cat. Everyone loves her!" or something. You were happily singing your own praises that one time, right? I get it! Okay, I'm sorry! I'll be quiet! Then, Murakami-kun, you come with me. Huh? Uh, I'm a self-conscious high schooler. I can't show up to karaoke uninvited. Yes, you don't seem to have many friends. That's not true at all! Anyway, I have to work. Work? I'm a private tutor. Kana-Chan, will you go with me? How could I go? I can't even talk. I'd ruin the mood. Here, take this. There's enough money here to cover the karaoke cost. Huh? You're taking a big risk coming to school. You should have fun with your classmates once in a while. Thank you. What's wrong? Nothing! What am I... feeling? Karaoke What should we sing next? Yeah... Hey! Neko-Chan, you should put in a song, too. What is this? Huh? You've done karaoke before, right? No, never. Wow. Don't get out much? I just don't know many songs. Kuroha-san, you're always with Murakami, right? Are you two a thing? "A thing"? To tell you the truth, I've really wanted to get to know you. Well, that's it for today. Huh? Isn't it kinda early? You always say I should do more. Sorry. I have an errand today. Like what? Ryota, don't say it's a date! I'm your teacher. Don't say "Ryota." If you have time to ask silly questions, just do some review. It's not a silly question... Here. If you don't know a song, we can sing together. Say... Yeah, what? My heart doesn't beat faster when you grab my hand. Why not? Huh?! Who knows...? Neko-Chan, you're funny! There's only one reason for that. I can sing on my own. Okay. Then go for it!

Murakami-kun? Something wrong? Not really. I came to sing alone. It's not like I was worried about you. I see. She takes everything at face value... Having fun at karaoke? Yes. I see. That's good. Be careful going home. What the heck am I doing? I'm acting just like a stalker! Hello? It's me. The results are in. That medicine, its molecular structure was not crystalline. And that means, copying it inside of a month is a hundred percent impossible. There's no way this will make me give up. Giving up would mean... giving up on the lives of those four girls. There's no way I could do that. Besides, there must be pills at the lab they came from. If we could just figure out where it is... Aw, jeez. This is no good. I wonder what happened. Why they heck are you dressed like that?! What, this? I've got no choice! It's super hot in here. Plus these aren't panties. It's a swimsuit. That's a matter of perspective, right?! True, I'm not wearing a bra. You turned on? Honestly, it's no different from any other- You totally don't understand the delicacy of a girl's heart, do you?! I thought you wanted me to crack a joke! Also, no "delicate" girl would sound proud about being bra-less! Kotori? And even Kuroha?! Well, it's just so hot! Murakami-kun? What are you looking at? Uh, nothing! By the way, Kazumi... What's up with that thing? It stopped working for some reason. Without this, I can't connect to the Net. Can you fix it? Probably. But I need a part. I was thinking of going to Akihabara tomorrow. I'll get the parts for y- You'll take me with you?! Uh, I was gonna go alone... All right! Uh, I was gonna go alone... I've always wanted to go! Yes! Yes! Well, fine. We'll meet at the station tomorrow at 9:00am. Don't be late. Sure thing! I'm super happy! I can't wait! Oh yeah, Kotori. There's something I wanted to ask you. U-uh, okay! Do you know anything at all about the lab? Um... They never let a low-grade witch like me know anything. Oh. But... I did hear why the lab was built. It's just a rumor, though. Rumors are fine. Please tell me. Apparently, they found them about 100 years ago. Found "them"? Found what? Alien ruins. Alien... ruins? Because ll... I've met one. An alien. Come to think of it, even Kotori said... I've seen them for myself. Kotori, have you really seen an alien?! Y-yes! I've seen one... an alien. Our disposal of the escaped witches is progressing steadily. We've just recovered three more harnests and drasils. What's more, upon interrogating Kikako, we learned that she'd observed No. 1107. To think, she's still alive. Recovering the Grane is our top priority. Whether No. 1107 lives or dies is irrelevant. Understood. Very well. Begone. Can we trust Ichijiku with this? The man is a brilliant researcher. He's essential to the plan. Also, it won't be much longer. It's been a century since the ruins were discovered... The day for which we have longed draws near. Welcome back, sir. We're going to recover the Grane. We'll be using Nanami. Prepare her. Nanami? So, what was the alien like? It was, like, all guts and muscle, a ball of flesh. It seemed like an experiment to gauge our reaction. Ah. I did that, too. That was an alien? So then... Was it like an amoeba with a whole bunch of eyes? No, it wasn't. It was "fleshier" than an amoeba. So that thing wasn't an alien? I heard another rumor. Apparently, there's an incredibly powerful witch at the lab. Powerful? Even more than Kikako? Yes. They said her magic could destroy humanity several times over. Kotori, is that Valkyria you're talking about? I've heard that rumor, too... There's an S-rank witch, even higher than AAA. There's an S rank?! Don't worry. There's no way a witch of that class would come after us. Valkyria... Like the Valkyries who take the dead to the next world. Humanity's destruction... ...but don't forget this. You're the only one who can save this world... from destruction... That might be what she was talking about. You know about Valkyria? No, I don't... But it might be that I'm going to have to defeat her. By the way, did you hear, Murakami? Hear what? They learned whether they can make the pills or not, right? Oh, yeah. What'd they say? It's no good. They can make them, but it would take at least six months to do so. Yeah, I figured as much. So did I. I'm sorry I got your hopes up. It's not like we were expecting anything. I'd like them to make the pills, even if it's not in time to save us. What for? There might be other escaped witches who could use them. It sure is hot in here! I'm gonna go cool off outside. Man, it's hot! If we don't know where the lab is, the only lead we have left... is this device. Figures... So the medicine's out, huh? Matsumoto Station Jeez. Kazumi sure is late! Murakami! Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean to be late! You're 10 minutes late. Don't be such a nag! If a girl shows up late to a date, it's because she's back-and-forthing about what to wear. So you can't blame us. For starters, this isn't a date. Hey! Are you really gonna ignore your girlfriend and read a book on your first date? You really are the worst! It's not a date. And you're not my girlfriend. Hey, look. You want some candy? What are you, some old lady from Osaka? Wow! So this is Akihabara! Check it out! There they are! This place is crawling with otaku! Keep your voice down. Pervert games! Hey, y'think all those guys are virgins? You really need to lower your voice! Also, it's not just virgins who buy those. Oh. So says the virgin, talkin' like he knows it all. You're a virgin too, aren't you?! Y-you shut up! A girl's virginity has more value! Here you go! Must be great to be a maid... Huh? Let's go to a maid cafe! Give me a break, already. If we come to Akiba and don't go to a maid cafe, then what's the frickin' point?! We came to get that part, right? Well, yeah, but still... Radio Center Radio Center Here it is! Radio Center That's it. This is the part. That's pretty expensive... Still, Kazumi's magic has helped us several times over. Guess I don't have a choice. Thank you! Now I can totally connect to the Internet! Wanna go? Huh? To a maid cafe. For real?! Yeah. All right! Cat Ear Day Welcome back, Master! Milady! I'm really here... I've dreamed of coming to a maid café! Rice omelet! I want a rice omelet! Uh... sure. Done! Your decoration of choice: "Endurance." Endurance Done! Your decoration of choice: "Endurance." Endurance Endurance Whoa... This looks delish! Whoa... This looks delish! Why did she ask for "endurance"? Is the stress getting to her? Yeah, this is pretty great. Here. Try a bite, Murakami. Cut it out. That's embarrassing, right? You know, I... I've had a lot of fun today. It might be the most fun I've had in my life. So, Murakami, what was it you needed in Akiba? Have you seen one of these before? No. The heck is that? Kuroha gave it to me. She said she got it from someone at the lab when she escaped. From the lab?! Like who...? It might transmit our location, but there's a ton of people with similar devices here. It shouldn't be easy for them to find us too quickly. I'm going to turn it on. What language is this? You can scroll the screen. This is a map! Is it telling us to go there? Even if it is, it'd be better if I didn't. Huh? Why not? That text at the beginning, that was German. Oh! That's right, you're half German. So, what did it say? "Kill the witches right now." "Do so, and we'll reveal the truth." That's what it said. I look up at the twinkling stars How I've always been enchanted by them Tomorrow, while having a dream I'll try being in love By asking for that which I don't have Everyone has their own happiness You taught me that, didn't you? I love that about you... Say... I've now fallen in love I asked the first star of night That somehow I could always be with you I know now for the first time Love is heartrending It brings pain But love is so very Look Something so warm
