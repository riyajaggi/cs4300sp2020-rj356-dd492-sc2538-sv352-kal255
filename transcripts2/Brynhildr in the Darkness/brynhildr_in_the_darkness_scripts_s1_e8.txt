 Where is that place on the map? I don't know. It doesn't look like we can enlarge or shrink it, either. There's no other info? There's a place to enter a password, but... For now, all we can do is look for it based on the landscape. Whoever we find waiting there... I'm sure they won't be friendly. Even so, I'm going. We've got no other leads. The Clue Left Behind Wir waren wohl zu langsam... (We were too slow...) Welcome back!

 Did you find the part? Yeah, no problem. I tried out the device and it displayed a map. A map? It's our only clue to the pills. I want to find the location today and go tomorrow, if possible. Then I'll go, too. Forget it. Huh? There was a message, too. It said, to know the truth, the witches should be killed right now. Your enemies could be there at this place on the map. All the more reason I can't let you go alone! I'm not gonna suddenly get killed.

 At the very least, there must be something they want to say. If it's not a trap, that is. Even if it is, it's our only lead to keeping you all alive. Just leave this to me. Murakami-kun! Show me that device again! What for? Come on. You don't plan to break it, do you? If so, forget it. I already have the map in my head. I... I'd be so very sad if I lost you. You staying alive would make me happier than me surviving. So, please, don't try the impossible. Don't worry. Working late and won't be home. Mom That map on the device had N-A-K-A written on the side. Nakano Nakahara Nakamurabashi Nakameguro Nakano Nakahara Nakamurabashi Nakameguro It could be Nakano, or Nakameguro... Nakano Nakahara Nakamurabashi Nakameguro There are too many. I can't narrow it down. Who the heck is it at this hour? Yo! Kazumi? You're checkin' out the map, right? I thought I'd help you. After all, I fixed the interface. I was just hitting a dead end, but... I'm the only one home right now. Oh? Well, that's great. Huh? I'm comin' in! Wait... Hey! Still, I'm surprised you found out where I live. Well, of course. Who do you think I am? At least here in Japan, there's no personal info I can't dig up. Even the porn sites you've been to on your computer there. I could expose your porn of choice... You want me to? Gimme a break already! Well? What did the map look like? The topography's like this. Whoa, you remember this much detail? I'm like a scanner: I can see something just once and the information gets filed away. Are you for real? This N-A-K-A must be a hint. I think it's probably a place name that starts with "Naka." Found it. Huh? Already? It's here. Naka-Karuizawa. The topography certainly matches. This area. From the satellite photo, it's all vacation homes. Wait. You don't have to search any more. Why not? If they have a witch with the same magic as you, they'll know someone is researching the map. I'll try the library in the morning and get it from there. So you're really going tomorrow? Yeah. It's Sunday, and we don't have much time. The sooner the better. Say... Hm? So, do you like Neko? Why are you suddenly bringing that up?! Do you? Well, I don't like her like her... Ah, that's good. So, wanna do it with me? Uh, "do it"? Or... am I really so unappealing that even now... you're not turned on? What's with you? Why do you want to have sex that bad? I need a reason? Huh? Is it so bad if all my emotions don't work according to logic?! That's not what I mean. You always make fun of my breasts, don't you? I haven't made fun of them. Yes you have! Always looking at Kotori's, comparing them... Take some responsibility and massage them so they'll grow. That's an A cup. I read it in a manga. Breasts get bigger if you massage them, right? What manga said that?! Look, just massage them. I won't tell the others. C-C'mon. How am I supposed to massage them? You mean pinch them, don't you? Y'know, I could kill you right now and I bet they'd find me innocent! Stop it! I told you to stop! Just do whatever you want to this body. S-sorry! Wh-what was that? I made a weird sound. I was so surprised! W-well, fine. It's too much stimulation for a virgin to handle at once. Let's call it quits for today. What's this? Not satisfied? D-don't be stupid! I'm not like you... I live according to logic. So the truth is, you really do wanna do dirty things to me, don't you? Here's a little something for the virgin. Can you feel my bare breasts on your back? "They're not even big enough to feel" is what I thought, but I stayed quiet so I wouldn't get hit. Dude, you've missed the last bus to get back. That's fine. I'll stay here. Huh? It's an honor, right? I'll sleep next to you for the night. And if a "mistake" happens, that's fine by me. You don't mind being a mistake? I have to get up early. Goodnight. It's hard to fall asleep when there's a girl right behind you. You asleep? Tomorrow... Don't take too many risks. Karuizawa sure is nice and cool. The location on the map should be that church up ahead. This is it, right? But it's in ruins. The edges are still fresh. This was recently knocked down. Don't tell me... The people trying to reveal their secret were attacked?! Not good. Now we're out of clues! I guess I'll ask that lady. Excuse me! Shaved Ice Shaved Ice Yes? Shaved Ice I'd like to ask you about something. Shaved Ice That church back there a ways... Did something happen? I was surprised to see it in ruins. Ah... Um, that? Souvenir Tea House Souvenir Tea House About three months ago, I guess, there was a loud noise in the middle of the night. Souvenir Tea House Souvenir Tea House An explosion? Souvenir Tea House Souvenir Tea House Maybe... Souvenir Tea House Souvenir Tea House but there was nothing on TV or in the papers. But there was nothing on TV or in the papers. Have you seen anyone in that area lately? No, nobody ever goes there. Okay, thanks. Sorry for all the questions. Not at all. I should be apologizing... I have to find a clue here. Things are looking grim for Kuroha and the others. What is this? There's something written here. This is... Could it be?! What are you doing over there?! The police? Come over here! Get a move on and do it! Don't tell me... That lady from before called them on me? Shit. That was careless. I'm sorry. It's all in ruins, so I got interested... It is 1:46 pm. Arresting a suspect for trespassing. Let me go! Don't resist! Add obstruction of duty and resisting arrest to that. Take him to the station. Sir. This is bad. How long will it take to get released? Will I even be released? If I'm caught here, it's all over. What the heck?! Kuroha? What happened to the car?! We don't know. It just suddenly exploded! Who is that? Stop! That was just a warning shot. The next one won't be. But, sir, they're both unarmed! Don't be dumb. It's obvious we're being attacked with explosives. And that girl has a ring on the back of her neck. So then, she's a wanted terrorist? Go ahead and shoot if you like. That thing can't kill me. Why are you provoking them?! Just get down. I take full responsibility for this. Before the bullet could even hit, it... All of you, fire at once! Sir! Aim! Fire! But that's impossible! You don't have to keep breaking bullets. Smash their guns! An! Call for backup! It's no good! The radio and our cell phones won't work! Could Kazumi have...? Ah, jeez. Neko's already done all the fun stuff. What in the world is she?! I've hung up! We should get out of here. Got it! I saw it! The ring on her neck! Let him go! If we can't use guns, then we'll settle this with brute strength. Don't screw with the police! Kotori?! Y-yeah! I thought this might happen, so I tied my arms to a tree and have been waiting there in the forest! O-okay, got it. Please move. What just happened? Am I dreaming all this? I thought I told you all not to come. Kana-Chan had a vision... She said that you'd be killed. You were shot while running from the police. Murakami-kun. Don't take on so much on your own. We can't sit and do nothing while you go putting yourself in danger. You've been a great help to us. But we can be of help to you, too. If we work together, we'll be stronger for sure. I worry about you all, in my own way. Still... What I have to do is believe in you, not worry about you. Once again, I'd be dead today without your help. Th-th-that's right! I'm glad you understand. But... Now we're out of leads. What should we do next? It's okay. There's still one clue left. Sure enough, it's impossible to synthesize it inside of a month. As his uncle, I was hoping to lessen Ryota's burden, and yet... Yes, it's me. Are you serious?! I see. Very well. Please keep me informed of any progress. I may have acquired something quite wondrous. My intellectual curiosity is piqued like never before. Those cells might actually be a fertilized alien egg. Sir. We've gotten word from the prefectural police. The information would suggest it's No. 1107 and No. 7620. How many people saw them? Six regional officers. Should we have Nanami handle it? Good thinking. After that, send her to find No. 1107. Yes, sir. Murakami and the others are running late, huh? That's good, actually. Hm? There's something I want to tell you. Like what? It's been a while now, but I've thought about killing you again, you perverted bigmouth! Bigmouth? Oh, you're talking about Valkyria? Don't be mad. I can't help it if it just came out. What's with your attitude? You really piss me off. I'd say you're the one who's been sassy recently, wouldn't you? Getting cocky 'cause your boobs have gotten bigger? H-how would I know? Why are you looking there, Kazumi?! Lemme see those tits. A-are you crazy?! Oh! No bra, huh? Don't look! Don't look! Don't be like that. I'll make you feel great... No! Stop! Stop it! What are you doing? Neko! Kazumi was about to rape me! D-don't make me out to be like that. Were you picking on Kana-Chan? That's right! Just listen! Th-that's not it. Right, Kana? We were getting along fine. Pudding Pudding Here, Kana! Here, Kana! Want some pudding? The fridge made it nice and cold! Th-th-that's my pudding! Don't be so stingy! If you keep eatin' this sweet stuff, you'll become an even bigger pig! A pig? "Bigger"?! Just cut it out. Oh, yeah, Murakami. You found some kind of clue, huh? That device had a place to enter a password, right? You figured out the password? No. But some of the writing on the church wall had blood under it. Like someone was trying to say something... But we can't power it up here. Yeah. We need to get you all some place safe before we turn it on. Still, if that's not the password, we're really out of leads. Hello, everyone. Sorry for calling you all here like this. I'd like to hear what happened yesterday, in detail. I don't know what your position is, but who do you think you are, wearing those sunglasses? I need these to protect myself. Pay them no mind. There's nothing else to say. We've written everything in the report. More to the point, we saw what could only be described as superpowers. I want a straight answer on that. Otherwise, there are steps that I can take. This is why I hate the non-careers. I guess it can't be helped. Fine. I'll tell you everything we know. Actually, there's someone I'd like you all to meet. Who the hell is that?! Now, now. Please remain calm. Do as I told you. She has "superpowers" as well. And they're quite strong. Her face has a peculiarity to it. Everyone... please see for yourselves. Already finished? Fine. Now then, I'd like to hear about yesterday's incident. That again? How many times have we said it? We tried to catch a young man trespassing on church property, but he got away. That's the extent of it. Nothing major happened. Why was this hearing necessary? Oh, I see. Please accept my apologies. Did any of them have memories of No. 1107? There was a boy in a hat and glasses, and a girl wearing a helmet. I see. Your mission is to pinpoint No. 1107's location. First, let's try a nearby location with lots of people. Take that off here. Just so you know... there's a beacon attached to your harnest. If you don't want to die, you'll do as I say. Yes, I know.
