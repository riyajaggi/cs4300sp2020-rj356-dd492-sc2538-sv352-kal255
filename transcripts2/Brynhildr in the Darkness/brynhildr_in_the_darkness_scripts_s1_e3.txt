 Is Kuroha-san out today? She was gone yesterday, too. She's absent a lot for someone who just recently transferred, huh? Kuroha-san... What happened? She's covered in bandages! For real? Kuroha! What happened?! A cold. Cut the crap! There's no way that's a cold! I'm fine. I can still go to the beach. Kuroha never did tell me how she got hurt...

 And the next day, she didn't come to school. Death Suppressants Neko! Neko! Hang in there! Neko! I knew something happened! Neko! Neko! Answer me! Neko! Kuroha... Kuroha! What happened?! Just hold on! Hey! Are you okay?! Please... take me to... the kitchen... in back. That chest-of-drawers... We witches have to take these pills...

 "death suppressants" every day or else we'll die. If we don't take these, after 30 hours our skin splits and our bodies vent blood. After 35 hours, our organs dissolve and we die. We have 10 pills left... That'll last us both five days. To us, these pills are life itself. She forced herself not to take one till she absolutely had to! I've tried to conserve them, but I don't think I can make it to the beach in eight days. It's my fault, for inviting her to go see the ocean. Don't worry. I took a pill, so I'll heal soon if I get some sleep. It's not like this is your fault. I wanted to see the ocean. It almost feels like... I've wanted to go there for a long time. Where's Neko? Sleeping in the kitchen. Where can you get those pills? Nowhere but at our former lab, I'm sure. But we escaped in transit, so we don't know where the lab is. I see. We only have five days to live. So I have a favor to ask you. For these last five days, let us eat cake. I have to wipe this off. Hot water... What are you doing? You feeling better already? I'm fine. Once we take the death suppressant, our wounds heal right away. I see. Kana said if I had nothing to do I should cut some firewood, So... Hey. That's too much wood. We won't be able to use it all. It's not like it's certain that they'll die. If I can just find a way to get more pills... Hey! There's smoke coming from the house! Why's it on fire?! I was boiling water. I'll get Kana out! You smash down the kitchen and put out that fire! What's up with this smoke?! Kana! Let's get out of here! Hey! Don't use this as an excuse to cop a feel! Shut up! Damn! You're so heavy! Though you don't have any breasts to speak of. Did Kuroha do it? Let's go. Wow. The fire's already out. I'm sorry. Is everything okay? Kana-Chan, I'm sorry. The pills all burned up. You took your last one yesterday. It's all... It's my fault! Don't cry, Neko. Don't worry about it. I'll just die a little faster, that's all. But I don't want to suffer the pain of melting to death. You should kill me before that happens, okay? Crush me so I won't suffer. Damn! Isn't there something we can do? Think... I have to think! We're still okay. We just have to get some pills from the Takayama Factory of Dresden Pharmaceuticals, the drug's maker. How do you know that? I remember the drug's identification code. "DR" is for Dresden Pharmaceuticals. "623" is the drug type. "G" is the factory. For this maker, it's the Takayama location. Is it normal to know that sort of thing? It was in a book about drugs I read once. I'd like to think I have a pretty good memory. I can see something just once and my brain records it like a scanner. It's nothing compared to you guys, but I guess that's my special power. But because of that... even the things I want to forget stick around to haunt me. That's not "haunting" at all. Not wanting to forget, but doing so anyway, is much sadder. Yeah, you've got a point. Hey. What should we do now? We don't have much time. Let's use the observatory computer to look up the drug's factory. I'll take her. It's fine. She's heavy. Wait, couldn't you just use your power to transport her? No. All I can do is break things. My power can affect people if I touch them, but I don't have fine control over it. I see. So then, when you beat me in arm-wrestling... We're lucky your arm didn't break. You did that knowing it could break?! It's no good. There's no info about those pills... But now we know where the factory is. Dresden Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Information - Production - Quality Control - Distribution But now we know where the factory is. Dresden Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Information - Production - Quality If we take the bus and a train we can make it there today. If we take the bus and a train, we can make it there today. Location: Kurayoshi, Tottori Prefecture If we take the bus and a train, we can make it there today. Location: Kurayoshi, Tottori Prefecture The problem is security. In that case, let's call Kazumi. "Kazumi"? A friend, one who escaped with us. Kazumi-Chan can do anything online. It's thanks to her that I got into your school. If we ask Kazumi-Chan, she might be able to lift the security. But she doesn't come cheap. She takes your money even though you're friends? Not money. She gets death suppressants as compensation. So then, you're trading your lives for her help! That means Kuroha and Kana sold pieces of their own lives to save mine... But this time, we don't have any pills to give her. Our only choice is to ask her to do it for the pills we will get. CQ, CQ. Kazumi-Chan? Kazumi-Chan! If you're there, please respond. Could y'please not call like it's no big deal? Keepin' in touch like this will make us easier to catch. Kazumi-Chan, we want to ask you for another computer job. Huh? Fine, but you gotta pay up front. Sorry. We don't have any pills to pay with. Kazumi-Chan? Yeah. Well, I feel bad for you and all... But I don't do volunteer work. Wait! We're going to the factory where the drug is made. We'll pay you in pills once we get them. So you want me to neutralize their security, huh? That sounds interesting! I'll do it. In return, you gotta give me half the pills you steal. Huh?! Hey you! That's kinda greedy, isn't it?! Huh? Who are you?! Neko! Kana! Did you get an outsider mixed up in this? Don't you get it? He'll be killed for sure! Yes, I know. Well in that case, fine. More importantly, can you really disable their security? Well, no human could do it. But I'm a witch. It'll be a cinch for me to crack their codes. If that's true, her power could disrupt society itself! Neko, run! What is it? A vision. Kana-Chan, what did you see? Neko... Neko, you'll be killed! You'll get cut in half! Neko, you can't go to that factory! We've found traces of someone searching for the drug's identification code. From where? Not only did they spoof their IP address, they went through a few anonymous, overseas proxies. It will take some time to identify. Fine. Once we've dealt with things, it will all be moot. Time to deploy, Saori. Make sure the escapees are disposed of. Otherwise... You will be the one who dies. Understood. I will die? It's Saori. She's waiting in ambush at the factory. Saori! She's ranked AA, right? Huh? What's "AA"? We witches have ranks. AAA is the highest, and C is the lowest. Incidentally, we are ranked B or lower. We were going to be disposed of... Because we're defective. Even their magic is B-rank? Saori is AA, a hybrid that uses two classes of A magic. There's no way we can beat her. What's Kana's accuracy rate? If we do nothing, 100%. But we can change the future through our actions. If the forecast changes, I'll see a different future. If I see nothing, then nothing has changed. But as it stands, her prediction showed us the ambush. So we can change that future for sure. Wait. If there's someone at the factory, the drugs may have been collected already. Hey, Kazumi. You still have pills, right? Can't you share some with these guys? Huh? How could you even suggest that? You're tellin' me to hurry up and die?! This doesn't even concern you, so just butt out, dumb-ass! It's okay. They don't plan on letting us make it out alive, so I doubt they'd bother removing the pills. The factory's our only shot, huh? So then, what kind of magic does Saori use? The first type is a slicing attack magic. Anything within six meters gets cut to ribbons. And the other is... Your harnest has been fitted with a homing beacon. If you try to escape, it will be ejected and you'll die. So don't do anything foolish. We can come up with all the plans we want, but the real problem is this Saori girl. Flipping the switch on a witch's harnest will make her unable to use magic. "Harnest"? This device. There are three switches. The bottom right is the Hang Up button. If it's pushed, we can't use magic for one day. On the bottom left is the Eject button. If it's pushed, we die. But magic has no physical effect on a harnest. So we can't use magic to break or flip a switch. We have to get close and flip it ourselves, huh? And what's the third switch? We don't know. All they said is that it's something far worse than death. So we're all too scared to flip it. No one has ever seen it flipped, either. A switch worse than death? Well, now we know what we have to do. It's no good. I can't see it! Even though you're discussing your strategy, I'm not seeing a new future. Neko, you can't go! If you do, you'll be killed! Will this guy die? "This guy"? The chump will probably survive. "Chump"?! I see. Then that's fine. I'm sure the plan will go well. What kind of logic is that? There's no point to this if you die! Hey. I have a favor to ask you: Don't let Neko use too much magic. If she does, her harnest might hang up on its own. Also, when Neko uses her powers, she loses things that are dear to her. Dear to her? Hey! It's already time for the train. If you don't leave now, you'll miss it. O-okay. Hold on, Kana-Chan. We will get those pills. Be careful out there... both of you. R-right. Okay, let's go. Sorry, Kana. I don't have any pills to give you. Still, I can't go dyin' before the operation starts at 12:00. I'm counting on you, Neko. What're you doing? D-don't look! Drawing a picture or something? Why would I be drawing a picture? Well, you can't write, can you! Don't make fun of me! I can write anything, so long as it's simple! That's the factory. You follow the plan, going in through the front and getting Saori's attention. I'll go in around back, sneak behind Saori, and flip the switch on her harnest. If you run into trouble, make as much noise as possible so I can find you. Got it? Hey, I have a favor to ask. Once you're inside, read this letter. Is this from before? Please. What's with her? It's time! It's 12:00. We're counting on you, Kazumi! Okay! Kuroha's already started. Oh, right. The letter. That idiot! No good... It's no good! What is? I don't have a new forecast. At this rate, Neko will die! Don't tell me... Neko, did you plan this from the start?! Coming in through the front door? You really are dumb, aren't you? It's been a while, Neko... The defective witch who can't kill anybody. I'll slice you to pieces. She... I will lead Saori away. While I do, please find the pills and run. Please don't come help me. If my life can save Kana and Kazumi, my life is worth double. That girl... Right from the start, she'd planned on being a decoy and dying alone. True, if I do as she says, Kana and Kazumi can definitely be saved. But... How could I leave her to die?! What is it? What's wrong? The forecast changed. Now Murakami will die too! They'll both be killed! Stop this! Why do we have to kill each other? "Kill each other"? Don't be stupid. This will be a slaughter... on my part! D-dammit! It's no use. There's nothing I can't cut. I don't mind being killed... but I have to keep Saori busy till the pills are found. Over there?! Oh, my. Caught you already? Damn you! You're hung up! Now you can't use any more magic. So that's Saori, huh? Those are Kuroneko's moles! How? They weren't there before... Oh! As she grew, the moles shifted from where they were when she was young. It's really her! I'm so glad. Kuroneko is alive! Hold on, Kuroneko! But why don't you remember me? Don't let Neko use too much magic. She loses things that are dear to her. Not wanting to forget, but doing so anyway, is much sadder. I see. The things dear to her that she loses are her memories. That explains everything. Well, she doesn't have to remember me. Going forward, we'll just make new memories of being together! Why? Why are you here? You'll be killed! Begging for your life? Don't bother. Run! Please! What a fool. I... I... lost Kuroneko again?! The other is... No, not yet. It's still okay. I look up at the twinkling stars How I've always been enchanted by them Tomorrow, while having a dream I'll try being in love By asking for that which I don't have Everyone has their own happiness You taught me that, didn't you? I love that about you... Say... I've now fallen in love I asked the first star of night That somehow I could always be with you I know now for the first time Love is heartrending It brings pain But love is so very Look Something so warm
