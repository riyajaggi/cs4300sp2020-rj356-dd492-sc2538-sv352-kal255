Ice cream. Huh? I want to eat ice cream. It's not as if I'm being spoiled. My magic needs lots of sugar to work. Are you for real?

 Is it good? Not bad. Sure enough, the outside world is wonderful. Fake Memories Here. It's a portrait of the high schooler in those policemen's memories. Nanami, your drawing is- Yes. My specialty. Well, fine. We'll deal with him, too, but No. 1107 comes first. What are you writing? A journal. We may be working on this for a while. Say... Hm? You won't forget me, will you? Where did that come from?

 Never mind that. Answer the question. There's no way I could forget you. If I did, I wouldn't be able to do my job. Oh. Liar. It won't be that easy to find her, huh? Still, you sure can eat. This is for my magic, too. Really? You sure you don't just want to eat sweets? In any case, do you have to go raising your skirt every single time? I can't scan a person's memories unless I look in their eyes. This is the most effective way to get people to look my way. Anyway, we need to go somewhere with more people, or my magic will be useless. You're probably right. The biggest city near here would be... Good call. Our chances may be better here. Still, if you raise your skirt here in the city, they'll call the police. Then what should I do? You don't have to do anything. You're cute. People will turn to look even if you just stand on the sidewalk. What's wrong? Say something. Are you actually blushing? It's hot. I'm stripping. Huh?! This is even worse! Hey there, girlie. What's up? Those sure are some sexy clothes! Wanna hang out with us? Lemme give those titties a squeeze! Don't interfere. Papa! Mama! Where are you? Let's go home! Hey, what the...? What's gotten into you?! What did you do? What's gotten into you?! I erased all his memories from today back until he was five. Now he's a five-year-old with stubble. I have to make sure these sunglasses stay on. We can take a break if you're tired. I doubt we'll find her soon. K-Kikka? Now, my work is practically done. Did you learn something? Say... Can I have just one day to myself? I'll do what I'm supposed to. What nonsense is this?! Do you understand your position- Scanning and erasing memories isn't all I can do. By looking someone in the eye, I can give them new memories, too. That doesn't seem to faze you. Yeah. If these sunglasses stay on, there's no way you can alter my memories. I've found you, Yasuda! You got some balls, laying hands on my sister! Huh? Who're you calling Yasuda? You lost this fight the moment you brought me to a place with so many people. Dammit! This is why I didn't want to leave the lab with a witch! Bastard! There you are, Sakamoto! Kawasaki! You swindled my mom, you asshole! This is for my daughter! Oh, no! Hey. Could you please let go? I'm sorry. What am I doing here? Ow... What was I doing? I saw them. His memories. Those lab researchers... What they're attempting is horrible. I swear. I can't believe I hit my head on a telephone pole... Ah. I knew it would take no time for him to forget me. Kikka. What's going on? Well, I... Um... My friend said she wants to meet you. Huh? Will you come with me for a bit? Agata-no-Mori Park I think she's around here somewhere. Is that her over there? An! Nanami-Chan! I brought Ryota here. Thank you. Well, you can leave now. Huh? Uh... Yeah. Agata-no-Mori Park Why did I have to introduce Ryota to some girl? Huh? Where did I even meet her? What's your name? Nananii. I've found No. 1107. Kotori, Kazumi, Neko, and Kana are at the observatory. A witch! Wait! Don't make trouble. I don't want to kill anyone if I can help it. My magic won't take long. Your magic is reading people's memories? No... You can read and even change them, can't you? What makes you think that? There's no way KikkKa could be friends with a witch. And yet, she called you her friend. So then, you can read people's memories and change them, too. Just who are you? If you have to ask, you must need to look in someone's eyes for your magic to work. I made a mistake. To think, someone could be this perceptive. I was just going to erase his memory of meeting me, but... You won't kill me, will you? Huh? The others who've come after us so far have gone straight for the kill. But you didn't do that. So what? Well, I... I guess... I thought maybe we could be friends. Be friends? Nothing to report at present. Please extend the cancel time for Nanami's beacon. Yes. Till tomorrow. Still... Why are they making me watch the castle and make regular reports? Don't talk foolishness. I'm going to enjoy being outside for the day, then return to the lab and report you all. If I do that, I'll be rewarded. I don't know about this "reward," but are you fine with just one day of freedom? We have a clue that could lead to getting more pills. If we can disable that beacon, you could be free for real. You're saying you can take off the beacon? I'll do something. Please believe me. You're telling me to believe you, yet you're averting your eyes? I'll look at your memories again. If you're telling the truth, I'll believe you. You won't erase or change them? So then, you're saying I should trust you when you don't trust me? Okay, fine. I trust you. Sorry. It seems I was a bit careless. I've erased all your memories, since when you were born. You're now a baby who can't even talk. I'm sorry. I know I had to fool her, but acting like a friggin' baby... Ow! Still, I can remember: My name, what happened today... Did she make a mistake? Or maybe... 67, 68, 69... 70, 71- Um... Hm? We're still not done? I haven't counted to a hundred yet, right? You gotta take your time in the bath. What, you already dizzy? No, I'm not dizzy... Wait, are you gettin' turned on? No! A-and please don't ask things like that! Hey! This is bad! Wh-wh-why are you peeping on us? Now's not the time for that! A witch is after us again! And she knows all about you and how you're hiding at the observatory! This is what Nanami looks like. You know, I'm always impressed by how much you can remember. Maybe it's my photographic memory that prevented Nanami from erasing everything in my head. Found her. Huh? Already? This is her, right? She showed up on a park camera tonight. But I can't tell where she is right now. If we don't do something by morning, we might lose our chance. I see. Well, I'd like us all to decide together. If we find Nanami... Do we fight her? Or do we flee this place and lie low somewhere else? Well? You're checking out? Yes. Well, you're already paid up. Thank you for your stay! I've decided... No more magic for today. For just one day, I will be a normal girl. Oh, no. I'm hungry... Hey. Lend me some cash. I want to go shopping. I don't mind lending you some, but will you pay me back? You can't repay me? Then you'll have to sell your body. Huh? How much will it take? Fifty yen. That's way too cheap! With that, I can buy a day's worth of 10-yen candy. Then how about you show me those tits for 1,000 yen? That's probably the going rate. You've already seen a lot more than that during the experiments... Huh? What are you talking about? Did I erase those memories, too? Very well. Boobs it is. That's some really nice coloring. The gradation is beautiful. Have you seen 1,000 yen worth? Yeah. I'd say so. Who was that? That girl... 1,000 yen... With this, I can buy a hundred 10-yen candies. Such a feeling of power! Why'd you have to drop it in a puddle?! I'm sorry. You think that's enough? Now pay up! I don't have money like that... How much? How much for that card? It's rare, so about 1,000 yen. Here. Th-thank you. Is this okay? You two are friends, aren't you? Well, yeah... Right? Yeah. Then don't fight. Friends should be held dear. Thank you, Miss! Thanks! In the end, showing someone my breasts saved those two boys' friendship. Say, how much for my belly button? I saw it before, so zero yen. Got her! That girl's near the castle. Great job. So she hasn't left the city? Okay. Kazumi, please keep monitoring her. Understood. U-um... I'm not sure I can completely avoid looking at her eyes. If I try not to, I feel like I definitely will. Yeah, you have a point. That's when I thought, what if we wore sunglasses? Sunglasses? I can't switch places with someone who's wearing sunglasses, so... That man's actually nice. I got 1,000 yen for showing my armpits. Still, I have unlimited funds... Where can I get cake? The cheesecakes I've dreamed of! I'm so hungry... How about we get some crepes? Ah! good idea! I'm getting blueberry! Hey, that was my choice! Well then, I'll have chocolate-banana... with lots of fresh cream. You won't get the same thing, right? Really? Sounds good. Yeah. Those are friends, huh? How nice... Murakami-kun! Nanami's on Nakamachi Street! Got it. Let's go! So expensive! This is bad! Japanese Ice Cream Chiffon Cake Matcha Roll Cake Mont Blanc Pancakes with Maple Soft Serve Tropical Gelatin Japanese Ice Cream Chiffon Cake Matcha Roll Cake Mont Blanc Pancakes with Maple Soft Serve Tropical Gelatin I thought my 1,000 yen would last forever, Japanese Ice Cream Chiffon Cake Matcha Roll Cake Mont Blanc Pancakes with Maple Soft Serve Tropical Gelatin but it's practically useless! But it's practically useless! Have you decided? I want to eat this cake. Ma'am. And for your drink? I don't care about the drink. Oh... Sorry for the wait. At last, I get to eat cheesecake! I've considered dying so many, many times... but I'm glad to be alive! I don't want to go back... not to the lab. I thought maybe we could be friends. Wow, she's smiling! Oh, you're right. I've erased so many people's memories because the lab ordered it. And only a few people at the lab know who I am. Nobody knows me. I'm all alone. Nanami! Why haven't you lost your memories? Once I've seen something, I never forget it. So it looks like your magic didn't work on me. How interesting. You're a write-once? You won't live long. Huh? So, now what? You seem to have gotten some ideas in your head. You plan to fight me? No! We want to save you! "Save"? Don't be foolish. I tried to erase your memories. There's no reason for you to save me. I'm serious. Believe me! No one needs a reason to save someone who's suffering right in front of them. Suffering? I am? You don't know the first thing about me. I've always been alone. So it is hopeless, huh? Hey! Neko-san! You fool. If you take off your sunglasses, I can control you. We... We're all witches. We have no place to call our own. That's why we have to work together. If you just believe, Nanami-Chan, I'm sure we'll get along. "Get along"? I can't believe it... I just can't believe that! K-Kuroha. Nanami-Chan... I will protect Nanami-Chan! Her memory's been changed! No matter what happens, I will protect her! Kuroha! Come on, calm down! Neko-san, Nanami is tricking you! Don't you dare insult my friend. I didn't give her a memory of us being friends. So why...? If we find Nanami... Do we fight her? Or do we flee this place and lie low somewhere else? Well? I don't like either. I want to help her, to save this "Nanami" girl. Yeah. I agree with you. I hope we can be friends with Nanami-Chan. Kuroha! Neko-san! Wait! Huh? Kuroha. Murakami? She undid the magic? Magic? Nanami was manipulating your memories. Why did you give Kuroha her memories back? Because in your... in both of your memories... I saw myself. Come on now... How long do I have to watch this castle? I don't want to go back to the lab. I don't want to erase myself from your memories. What should I do? Hm? What's this? No one would want to go back there. So we'll help you. If we all team up, I'm sure we can make it work. Well, damn. This is no laughing matter... I look up at the twinkling stars How I've always been enchanted by them Tomorrow, while having a dream I'll try being in love By asking for that which I don't have Everyone has their own happiness You taught me that, didn't you? I love that about you... Say... I've now fallen in love I asked the first star of night That somehow I could always be with you I know now for the first time Love is heartrending It brings pain But love is so very Look Something so warm
