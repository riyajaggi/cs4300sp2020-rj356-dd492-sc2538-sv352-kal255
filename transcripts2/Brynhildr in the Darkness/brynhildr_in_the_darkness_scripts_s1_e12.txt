 Don't know what's being misunderstood Missiles flying, children getting shot Swindles everywhere People who should be the most loved ones killing each other Once you keep an eye off, things get stolen The world is like this, the world we don't know, the unknown world Out of our hands it don't matter, covering it up, acting like you don't see a thing If you think it's a different thing you won't notice that the world You live in is eventually heading towards this matter Look at it Oh yeah! The world is all linked together

 Save our loved ones and the world Hey, hey, because breaking down the piled wood castle is easy Save our loved ones and the world Hey, hey, because breaking down the piled wood castle is easy These peaceful days lasting is a wish Hey, hey, these peaceful days continuing is just like a wish Because I have no idea how many tickets "to live today" are left Because I have no idea how many tickets "to live today" are left Even at the time when you were playing cards Somewhere in the world, somebody is crying It's been a while, Neko. Who are you? Oh. You don't remember me, do you? Are you Valkyria? I have a name: it's "Mako." Do me a favor and don't call me that. I-it's you!

 No. 1107, Kotori Takatori. Come with us. Huh?! Kotori is No. 1107? See? She's here, isn't she? Tell me I did good, Chisato! No. 1107, you will not get away. Your life belongs to me. Hexenjagd This is bad. It's all over. This is our last shot... Murakami-kun! Huh? Murakami! I need to talk to you. So it's you. The one who's put ideas in the witches' heads. Please! I beg you, don't kill me! I only helped out because I felt sorry for them. I'm not part of this! What's with this guy? So, please, don't kill me! I see. I guess I am a sucker. I should just run away. But if I can make Valkyria hang up... It's all or nothing! Huh? The heck is this? Where do I push? Hatsuna-Chan! Hatsuna! Dammit. Just what are you? I thought I killed you before! This one won't die unless she's ejected. Then can we eject her? Yes. Letting her live would be problematic. Please wait! Hatsuna, I'm sorry. You could've run, but you tried to help. Tell me, why? These girls just want to live. Why won't you let them do even that?! Because there's no reason to do so. What's more, their very existence poses a potential threat. You're just saying what's convenient for you! Have you thought about the feelings of the witches you've killed?! Do you stop to consider the feelings of a bug every time you kill one? That's completely different! Witches aren't bugs. They're humans like us! You're saying all human lives are equally sacred? All creatures have their place. The only life that's sacred is one's own. No! That's not true! It's pointless to say any more. You may kill everyone except No. 1107. What? I thought I didn't have to kill Neko. Did you not hear my order? But...! I won't repeat myself. Understood. No! Everyone, please run while you can! Don't push your luck. Just shut up and come with us. Let Kotori-Chan go! What are you doing to Chisato?! Please, just leave. Neko... She is a pest. Hurry and do it. Neko, I'm sorry! Murakami-kun...? Murakami-kun?! Murakami! Murakami-san! Don't compare me to the likes of you. To me, there's a life more precious than my own. Murakami-kun? Murakami-kun! Murakami! Murakami-san! Murakami... I couldn't... save you all. I'm sorry. Don't talk like that, Murakami! Murakami-san! Murakami-kun? Murakami-kun! Murakami. I-it's you... Nananii. Hello. What are you talkin' about? "Nanami"? Nanami? I'm a vision etched into your memory. I made it so I'd appear when you thought all was lost. Well, yeah, everything is pretty much lost... Oh, no! He's lost so much blood that he's hallucinating! Don't speak. You can talk to me just by thinking. Okay. I read the memories of our supervisors, and I know the witches the lab fears most. What it fears? Yes. One of them is No. 1107, Kotori Takatori. The other is Neko Kuroha. Kuroha? She has a power even greater than Valkyria's. But it's unstable, and no one could control it. So the researchers sealed it up. I will tell you how to release it. But the way Neko is now, there's a 99.9% chance of failure and death. Still, taking that risk is the only way out of this crisis... Oh, no. I'm fading... Please wait, Nanami! Murakami! Hang in there! Bastard! How could you do this?! Kazumi-Chan! Damn you! Go ahead, use your power all you like. You can only break objects. Now you can't even use your useless magic. None of us wanted to be witches, did we? You made us into them! But why... Why do we have to lose everything important to us? Kazumi-san. If only... I were stronger. You... are strong. Kuroha, you're more powerful than Valkyria. Murakami-kun! What are you talking about? Nanami told me. I know how to undo the seal on your magic. We just... have to press the top button on your harnest. Go ahead, push it. She'll just melt and die. No. I can't do it. That button has 99.9% chance of killing you. I can't push it. That's enough. Kill her. Valkyria. Neko. I'm sorry, but... I must follow Chisato's orders. Don't do it! Goodbye. What? I can't use my magic! It can't be...! Oh, yes it can. It's been a while, Director Chisato. How did you find this place? We followed the GPS data. That device was turned on. Well? How does it feel to lose your precious powers? But how?! The Initializer. In his presence, all magic is neutralized. Now then. Would you mind handing over No. 1107? He vanished. Oh, no. No. 1107 is gone, too! Kotori? I swear, you were only grazed. You're really useless, aren't you? Shut up! I still neutralized the attack! You never told me they could teleport. Miki! You didn't do enough research! Hey! Don't go blaming me, okay? Murakami-kun! Murakami! Hold on! Murakami! Wake up, Murakami-kun! His heart... it's stopped. What? Now the hell what? It's meaningless, all of it. What's the point of me living if Murakami is gone? Murakami-kun... You said you'd remember everything, even if I forgot. You said that! I was fine with dying as long as you survived, Murakami-kun! Murakami-kun... No! Murakami-kun! It's okay. There's still a chance. Huh? Hatsuna! You're healed already? His heart stopped is all, right? I should be able to help him. For real? Then, please! Hurry and save him! But if I use this power, my body will melt. Huh? Even so, I owe him for that time on the tower, and we can't get pills without him. I'll give it a shot. I just have to heal him before I melt. His wound is closing! This is rough. His wound is almost completely healed... but his heart won't beat. No way. I've never hung up before! Hatsuna-Chan! Hatsuna! At this rate... I've died for nothing! Hatsuna! It can't be! Murakami isn't coming back and Hatsuna melted! Kazumi! Huh? Don't just sit there! You have to try CPR! O-okay! Murakami! Please, breathe! Murakami! Murakami-kun? Murakami! Murakami! Thank goodness... Thank goodness! Huh? Did I pass out? No way. You were totally dead! What? Hatsuna saved you... At the cost of her own life. Hatsuna did? Why did you do that? Why would you die in my place?! Either way, it doesn't matter. It's about time that these witches die. Who are you people? We are Hexenjagd. We're the resistance working to stop the lab. Why do you want to kill the witches? They haven't done anything! As long as the witches remain alive, the drasils within their harnests will continue to grow. "Drasils"? You mean those slime creatures? One day they will hatch, devouring the host witches' bodies to become absolute horrors. They are monsters that exist only to eat people. It can't be! These monsters will eat us? But none of you are what is most terrifying... It's No. 1107. Rena. Where am I? Why won't you show yourself to me, Rena? Who is Rena? "All life is equally meaningless." That's what I thought... up until Rena got sick and died. Rena's body was defective, but her brain - her mind - was intact. She didn't need a body. If I could supply her brain with oxygen and nutrients, she shouldn't die. But why wouldn't she come back? Why was her soul not there? How could I infuse her with life? What is life? Our objective is to create the humans meant to be the true rulers of this planet. And making that perfect life form requires a Grane, which has just a one-in-several-thousand chance of appearing in the drasils that are cultured within the witches' bodies. Um, who is Rena? I'm Kotori Takatori. That is the name of your original body. "Original"? Then what am I? All humans that inhabit the Earth were created by aliens. What?! We learned that by studying their ruins. Also, the aliens infused humanity's genes with a way to reset the Earth. Reset the Earth? The switch that will kill all mankind... is you. Kotori is? If the Grane within Kotori Takatori hatches, the cells of all living things will melt, and the Earth will become devoid of life. That's a little hard to believe. We were originally part of the lab. That's how we learned their true goal. So we raided their transport vehicles to try to kill Kotori Takatori... But we failed. The accident ended up affecting vehicles besides the one Kotori was in. Because of that, not only did Kotori get past us, we lost one of our comrades. Yeah, I get it. Guess we can't blame people for killing us over this, huh? Don't be stupid! For starters, it's not like it'll hatch right this second. You may be right. It could be a year or two from now... But it might also be tomorrow! Cut the crap! If they don't get pills, they only have a week left! "Resistance," my ass! What you're doing is no different from Ichijiku! I refuse to abandon hope. So, all of you, please don't give up either! In truth, the chance that it would hatch this week is extremely low. We could leave them and they'd die. Going after No. 1107 is more important. Yes, I know all that. But just where is Ichijiku's hideout? Not to worry. Huh? We can figure out where Ichijiku is. Kazumi! Can you do it, Kazumi? Well, of course! I'll hack into the lab's data and find him. This is the deal. In exchange for us locating Ichijiku, you'll have to take us with you. Don't be ridiculous. We've tried hacking into their systems, too. But there was a magical barrier... Don't go thinking your capabilities can match mine. Well? We're out of choices... Very well. Kazumi! Gotcha. Just leave it to me. All data on Ichijiku has been erased. I get it... This is the work of a witch on their end, huh? Don't take me for a fool. She's restoring the data. Incredible! This just might... Yes. Fine, you all may come with us. But we're still going to kill No. 1107. Kazumi! Near the lake where we fought Kikako last time. Ichijiku has a summer home in his mother's name. Great job, Kazumi. We leave at once! There's a helicopter waiting outside. Kana, you stay here. Okay. I'm counting on you to get Kotor! Yeah. We will bring her back. Thank you, Hatsuna. I won't waste this life you gave me. I fed my sister Rena's brain to the Grane in your spine. That should have made her consciousness inhabit the Grane... But it seems it didn't work. So I'll move the Grane to a new host. Then that means ll... You will die. Oh, I see. All lives besides my own are equally meaningless... except for Rena's, that is. I will awaken her consciousness, no matter how many lives it takes. Is Valkyria's life meaningless, too? Yes, of course. But it looks like she loves you. I saved her life once. She seems to feel indebted to me for that. Still, I simply needed her for my plan. I have no feelings for her. I knew it. But I love him! I-it can't be! It's going to hatch?! Nooooo! What's that? The heck?! Look at that! Ain Soph Aur... The light that governs life. When it covers the Earth, all life will perish. We're too late. Still, when you consider that billions will die and not even know why... I'd say we have it better. Kotori! Kagayaku hoshi miagete Itsumo akogareteta naa Ashita o yume minagara Koi o shite mitari Nai mono nedari de Shiawase wa hito sorezore to Oshiete kureteta ne Sonna Kimi ga Suki de... Ne...
