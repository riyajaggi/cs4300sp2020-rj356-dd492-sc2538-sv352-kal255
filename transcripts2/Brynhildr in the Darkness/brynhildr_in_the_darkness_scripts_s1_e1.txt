 Kuroneko... That's what I called the girl I was friends with when I was a kid. Say, have you really seen aliens? Yup. Then, one day 10 years ago, I made two mistakes I can't take back. The first mistake was... Not turning back at that point. Ryota! And the second mistake... Why? Why did I grab Kuroneko's hand? Since that day, I've looked up at the sky alone every night.

 Kuroneko... I want to see you again! While I Wait for You When I got to the 11th grade, I made it my goal to become a researcher at NASA. Equatorial Telescope Equatorial Telescope I decided to get as close to outer space as I could, to prove aliens exist now that Kuroneko couldn't. I decided to get as close to outer space as I could, to prove aliens exist now that Kuroneko couldn't. That was how, in my own way, I'd atone for my sin against her. Planisphere Know Your Stars Planisphere Know Your Stars Hey, why are you so sure aliens exist? You wouldn't believe me, so I won't say. I would, too! I'd believe you. Because ll... I've met one. An alien.

 What? I even know where one is! Then take me there! Fine. Huh? If you promise not to tell anyone where it is... Kuroneko and I always played together. I loved Kuroneko, and thought I knew everything about her... But this was the first time she'd mentioned meeting aliens. I couldn't believe her. The alien is up ahead. Once you see it, you'd better believe me. Then, that accident happened... Ryota! When I came to, I was in the hospital. By some miracle, I'd survived. They told me Kuroneko was safe in another hospital. What could I possibly say to make her forgive me? Maybe working together to prove aliens exist would help mend things. That was all I thought about while I was in the hospital. Then, on the day I was released, they told me the truth: After she fell from the dam, Kuroneko had died instantly. It's strange, but I don't even know her real name. All I remember are the moles under her arm, and that I called her "Kuroneko." Morning! Morning. G'morning! I totally didn't get enough sleep! Yo! Did you see, Murakami? See what? The results of that prep test we took before. You were the top 11th grader in the country! But I was only third out of all high schoolers. I still have a ways to go. That's not true at all. You're the top student in our grade. That's amazing, Murakami! Thank you, Kashiwagi-san. You're pretty curt, aren't you? Murakami's always cold to the girls. Yeesh... It's not as if I'm "cold." I'm just no good with them. Hey. Homeroom starts now. Hurry and take your seats. I'd like to introduce a transfer student. Transfer student?! That's unusual. The transfer exam is supposed to be really hard. This is Kuroha Neko. Kuroha... Neko?! Everyone, make her feel- Huh? What's wrong, Murakami? She looks like her. Her personality seems a little different, but... It's... Kuroneko, isn't it?! That's right! It's not like I ever saw a body. They just told me she died. Don't tell me...! You're alive?! Huh? I'm sure this is the first time we've met. No! We were little, so you might not remember... but you and I have met before! Before? And I can prove it, too! I don't know what you're talking about. Look! Stop your grumbling and just show me your armpit! Uh, her armpit? What the heck? Is he for real? Did Murakami-kun study so hard that he lost it? I didn't think he was that kind of guy. Say, Kuroha-san... That uniform is cute. Is it from your old school? It's original. Original? Sure enough... I guess it's not her. For today's pool lesson, we'll practice swimming underwater. This isn't a game, so please be careful. Ma'am! Yo, look at that! Yeah. That's one hell of a body! Who would've thought she existed... A gorgeous high schooler like that?! This school's full of girls who only care about studying! You're okay, Kuroha-san. You can stand here! Yo, look at that! Yeah. Talk about an awesome angle! At this rate... We've gotta "accidentally" swim over to the girls' side and touch those titties, huh?! What a bunch of thugs! Next group, are you ready? Ma'am! Okay, go under! Kashiwagi-san! What's wrong? Ma'am! Kashiwagi-san's leg got sucked into the filter and won't come out! She can't breathe! Go tell them to stop the pump! M-ma'am! Kashiwagi-san! Hang in there! Sure enough. Hang in there! Sure enough. Today, two students at this school... Oh, no! They won't make it! ...Will die. She's out! Kashiwagi, hang in there! MM... Ma'am. Thank goodness! Kashiwagi-san! Thank goodness! You all right? Hold on, okay? You all right? Man, I thought she was done for. Talk about good luck. When the poolside broke, it clogged the water pipe. True enough, things like this don't happen often. Just take it easy. Just take it easy. And the timing of It... And the timing of It... There's nothing else to call it but good luck. On days like this, the best thing is to unwind by looking at the stars. I just can't get it out of my head. I know Kuroha can't be Kuroneko. She died. Still, no matter how many times I try to let go, it's hard to take. It's been 10 years already, but I don't want to admit she's gone. I wish I could just erase all these memories of Kuroneko! You! What are you doing here? Can you look at the stars here? Uh, yeah. Apparently, there was an astronomy boom when Apollo went to the moon. This old observatory was built during that era... But now I'm the only member of the Astronomy Club. There were upperclassmen up until last year, but if no one joins next year, I guess it'll be shut down. I'm sorry. You look just like a childhood friend of mine. That's why I said that weird stuff in homeroom. A childhood friend? Yeah. A sort of quirky girl who believed in aliens. But she died, and it was my fault. So, I've decided to look for aliens in her place. That's why I look through the telescope like this every day. I'll make one thing perfectly clear... I! am not your childhood friend. And I don't know you at all. This is the first time we've met. Yes, I know. But if that's so, why did you come here? There's something I have to tell you. Huh? Today, two students at this school were meant to die. What?! One was supposed to die in the pool, but she was saved. Hey! What are you talking about?! And the other who is supposed to die... is you. I'm gonna die? What the heck do you mean?! The last bus leaves at 8:20. Yeah. That's the bus I always take. Do not miss that bus. If you don't get on it, you'll die. So you're saying I should believe this "prophecy" of yours? Think what you like. Just don't miss it. Well, I would've ridden the last bus without you telling me to. Otherwise, I couldn't get home. Oh? Well, that's good. I'll be going now. How many constellations are there in all? Oh. That's an old chart. But there's a list underneath, right? This? One, two, three, four- You don't have to count like that. There are six rows and eight columns, so It's 48. Amazing. You can add so quickly. Are you making fun of me? It's easy if you know your multiplication tables! What's that? Huh?! You have to know what that is! We learned it in second grade! Of course I know! Multiplication tables! I just, um, don't like sitting at them. Two times two. Huh? If you know how to multiply, then you can answer! What's two times two? What?! Um... Two times two! Twenty-two? Eight by two! "Buy two" what? Eight times eight! You ate what? How did someone who can't even multiply get into our school?! Shut up, shut up, shut up! I have my ways! Plenty of them! "Ways"? Well, fine. I'll give you this one. You may be a little smarter than me, but I am much stronger. Huh? Did you used to do sports or something? Not really. Jeez! What's with her? She's just talking nonsense. There's no way I'll lose to some girl who hasn't even trained. Come on. I'll arm wrestle you. Fine. Here goes. One, two, and... Thr- Wha...?! Owww! I'm sorry! I couldn't control my strength very well. Lemme see that arm! It's not like she's muscular or anything... If anything, she's delicate. What are you blushing for? N-no one's ever touched me like that! Wouldn't you get nervous? Huh?! Don't go getting the wrong idea. Actually, now that I look at her, she's pretty cute. Well, that makes sense. She's the spitting image of Kuroneko. She's totally my type. Are you satisfied now? No, not yet. Let me see you flex. Huh? Flex? Yeah. Give it a shot. That's all you've got? Why would I lose to a girly girl like you?! How should I know? It's just your own weakness, isn't it? CQ, CQ. Yes, it's me. Over. Why does she have a ham radio? The prediction has changed, but now it's even worse. Over. Huh? So it doesn't matter if he gets on the bus or not, I guess he'll just have to die, huh? Over. Ah, so that's it. Understood. I'll let him know. Over and out. Actually, it's fine if you miss the bus. Hey! What the heck was that just now?! Rather than "miss" it, just don't leave this building. What?! If you miss the last bus, you can't get home, right? Just stay the night here. Got it? I've warned you... You'd better believe me. Once you see it, you'd better believe me. Should I even try to assume what she's said is real? If missing the bus is the difference between me living and dying... I've got it. If her prediction is right, it should start raining around here soon. Yeah, right. The forecast was clear for today. It's really raining?! With this, both have been saved. Hold on! Akane-san! Akane-san! I'm not... I can't make it. Neko, take this... Get out of here, now. You can forget everything else... but don't forget this. You're the only one who can save this world... from destruction... Akane-san! Akane-san! Truthfully, I don't know what "saving the world from destruction" means... Akane-san! Stay with me! Akane-san! Akane-san! Truthfully, I don't know what "saving the world from destruction" means... But saving people I know will die is something I can do. CQ, CQ. What? It can't be! I stayed off the bus like she said, but I left the observatory. So according to her, I'm gonna die now, huh? Do I believe her? No... but I want to. Even if it means risking my life, I want to see for myself if she's right. If the time it takes to miss the bus really means the difference between life and death... Well, it's hard to imagine falling victim to crime out here in the middle of nowhere. If it were a major disaster like an earthquake, there'd be casualties other than me... So, what "smaller" disaster happens in heavy rain? A landslide! You gotta be kidding! Dammit! I can't move! She... really knew the future! I told you not to go home, didn't I?! Idiot! What the hell is she? She split that rock! I swear... The prediction said if you missed the bus, you'd die here. That's why I warned you. But the moment you decided not to miss it, the outlook changed. If I'd gotten on the bus, the time spent picking me up would mean me and everyone else would be crushed, right? I gathered that much from your behavior. If the bus had been hit, a lot more people would've died. That's why this time, you told me not to leave. If you knew all that, why did you come here? More to the point... Just who are you? Or what? Me? I'm... I'm a witch. Huh? Don't be ridiculous! Oh, you don't believe me? Even though you believe in aliens? Aliens don't go against the rules of science. But magic is the very definition of "unscientific." Still... I don't want to believe you, but the truth is, it doesn't make sense unless you are a witch. You split a boulder right in half, and beat me at arm wrestling with that spindly little arm... Drop that already! Hey, if you really are a witch... how did you get your powers? Surgery. And drugs. Dude, that... that ain't magic! The truth is... I didn't want to use these powers at all. I ran away from the researchers, and... I didn't want anyone to learn I was a witch. I already couldn't hear a word she was saying. The truth is, deep inside, I'd been holding out hope... "Kuroha could still be Kuroneko, right?" But she didn't have them... Kuroneko's moles. I look up at the twinkling stars How I've always been enchanted by them Tomorrow, while having a dream I'll try being in love By asking for that which I don't have Everyone has their own happiness You taught me that, didn't you? I love that about you... Say... I've now fallen in love I asked the first star of night That somehow I could always be with you I know now for the first time Love is heartrending It brings pain But love is so very Look Something so warm OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
