 Don't know what's being misunderstood Missiles flying, children getting shot Swindles everywhere People who should be the most loved ones killing each other Once you keep an eye off, things get stolen The world is like this, the world we don't know, the unknown world Out of our hands it don't matter, covering it up, acting like you don't see a thing If you think it's a different thing you won't notice that the world You live in is eventually heading towards this matter Look at it Oh yeah! The world is all linked together

 Save our loved ones and the world Hey, hey, because breaking down the piled wood castle is easy Save our loved ones and the world Hey, hey, because breaking down the piled wood castle is easy These peaceful days lasting is a wish Hey, hey, these peaceful days continuing is just like a wish Because I have no idea how many tickets "to live today" are left Because I have no idea how many tickets "to live today" are left Even at the time when you were playing cards Somewhere in the world, somebody is crying We won't make it in time. This is the end of everything. Let's pray to God. All right, fine. We'll go on our own! You're both hung up... so Valkyria shouldn't be able to detect you. But be careful!

 Neko. That Which I Want to Protect Neko, it's okay now. I'm sorry, Murakami-kun. But we're the only ones who need to risk our lives. Relax and get some rest. We'll be back after we save Kotori. Kotori-Chan is under that light? Yeah. It looks like she's in the basement of that summer house. Ain Soph Aur... A mechanism created by extraterrestrials to reset life on this planet. We might as well call those beings our planet's gods. Takachiho's aim is to replicate them, creating a new race of humans to rule this planet. In other words, rejecting our prior God, killing Him. The witches are simply tools to that end. B-but that's... Actually, I have no interest in any of that. And I have no use for a failure like you who couldn't bring back Rena. However, the Grane is vital to understanding the awakening process, so I'll be taking it back. To use in experiments on other witches, right? Naturally. I won't let you! You plan to eject yourself? If I can protect everyone, my death won't be in vain. If I melt to death, both the light in the sky and the drasil should disappear. What nonsense. Anyone who sacrifices himself is a fool. Is it so strange to do something for someone else? If the people I love can keep smiling, live to see tomorrow... then I'm fine being foolish or even dumb. Oh, no... Ain Soph Aur is vanishing? Something must have happened to No. 1107. So then...! Of course. We have to use this chance! Kotori... Kotori! Still... It's like a maze in here, huh? Wait, dammit! Where's Kotori-Chan? No. 1107 is dead. No...! Don't you lie! It's true. She ejected herself. Kotori-Chan did? It seems she intended to hinder my research, but in the end her death was meaningless. "Meaningless," you say?! I leave you to finish things here. Lives are never of equal value. There is a pecking order. Spending time with Chisato makes this quite clear. Neko. Come with me. Why are you so obsessed with Neko? I'm not going with you! Understand: I want to save you. Neko! Neko, wake up! Now's not the time to worry about others. I have no intention of saving you. Why am I obsessed with Neko? Of course I am... She's my little sister. Shit! I have no idea which way I should go. Nanami? If Ichijiku is here, he would be that way. How do you know that? It seems that the man who supervised me has come here before. Now hurry. Got it! What is this place? Kotori! Hang on, Kotori! Murakami-san? What on Earth happened to you? I ejected myself. You fool! It's not funny! B-b-but, this was the only way to save the others. Even if everyone is saved, it's meaningless if you have to die, right?! No, that's not true at all. Huh? I was clueless, and couldn't do much of anything... But I was so happy to have spent the time I did with you all. Out of all Earth's creatures, I was the happiest. So I'm not sad at all. Kotori! Murakami-san. I have one last favor to ask of you. Please stop my big brother, Chisato Ichijiku. He did all this to bring me back to life. What are you talking about, Kotori? "Please, don't cause people any more sadness." Tell my big brother I said that. Thank you... so much... for everything. Murakami-san. Please take care... of the others... Kotori? Kotori! I wonder when she became aware she was Ichijiku's little sister? I know you're upset, but there's no time to cry. Yeah. I know. What was that light before? It was quite a fascinating phenomenon... It's done processing, eh? A miracle might be about to happen, Ryota! Kazumi! Kazumi! Oh, hey. Murakami, huh? What kind of face is that? You look like hell. How did this happen? Valkyria got me. She and Ichijiku are dangerous. Don't waste time here. Hurry up and save Neko! B-but... Don't worry about me. You get it, right? Kazumi... Dummy! Get a move on! You're the only one left. If you don't save her, then who will? Now, go! Get outta here, Murakami! I'll come back for you! In the end, I couldn't tell him how I feel, huh? Murakami, I really wanted to have kids with you. And I seriously can't believe I'm gonna die a virgin! Still, I found someone to fall in love with. It wasn't such a bad life... Kazumi! At this rate, Neko won't make it either. Please, push the top button on my harnest! Hurry! I don't care what happens to me! From here, just keep going straight. This is as far as I can guide you. Got it. Thanks, Nanami. There's no need to thank me. Instead, just don't die, Murakami. Right! I can't kill my own sister. But, to me, Chisato's orders are absolute. After all... Oh, no. At this rate, Valkyria will... Sir, you can't! If you go in now, one minute's exposure to that radiation will be fatal! Since that day, Chisato's life has been more precious to me than my own. Valkyria. Chisato. I told you to finish them all off. That one is an utter failure. She has no right to live. B-but- That's enough. Put her down there. I'll eject her. Neko, I'm sorry. I'm sorry... You're so full of shit! "No right to live"? That would be YOU! You do nothing but play with other people's lives... You have no right to live! You killed Kotori and Kazumi! Kotori and Kazumi-Chan both? I will never forgive this! I have no intention of asking forgiveness. I've killed countless people to get this far. For your little sister's sake? How do you know about that?! Your little sister's soul was inside Kotori. In her last moments, here's what Kotori said: "Please..." Please, don't cause people any more sadness. "Tell my big brother I said that." I see. So it was a success! Why are you laughing? Your sister came back to life, only to die again! Rena's skull is still preserved. I just have to try again. Damn you! I can't... move! Murakami-kun! Kuroha! I won't let you lift another finger against Chisato. Open your eyes, Valkyria. All Ichijiku cares about is bringing his sister back to life. You're just being used! Is that true, Chisato? Yes. That's what I like about you. It's no good. Both these guys are crazy. In any case, why are you still alive? I won't allow you to spout such insolence! Murakami-kun! You'll be punished, too. You will be quiet and watch as this boy suffers and dies. Stop it! The way to undo the seal... Murakami-kun... I will protect you! No, don't do it! Stop it, Kuroha! You fool. You'll just melt and die. Murakami-kun. I... I will protect Neko! You may have forgotten, Neko... But on that day, when I was to be disposed of, you protected me with your own body. So I made a vow... I would use my forecast magic to protect you. I gained the ability to move. I can't predict things anymore... but I'll give my life to protect Neko! Kana-Chan... Don't do it, Kuroha! Thank you. Both of you. Neko! Kuroha! She's awakened! Huh? It can't be. My magic! Sure enough, I'll need some physical therapy. Ryota! Are you okay, Ryota? "Ryota"? Kuroneko?! Yes. So then, your memories... Your memories are back?! Yes. I remember now. How we played together as kids, all of it. We meet again, Ryota. There's... so much I want to say to you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I grabbed your hand back then. No. I'm the one who's sorry. If I'd been able to hold on... Dammit! It's all right. This time I will protect you, Ryota! Don't worry, Chisato. I'm here for you. I remember you, Sister. You and I are like night and day. But I won't be defeated. I have so much more I want to protect than you! Neko! Kuroneko! Hang in there! I won't lose! I won't forgive anyone who gets in Chisato's way. Not even my own sister! I can't use my magic! It can't be... Ichijiku is shielding Valkyria? I can't cancel out her magic for very long... Hurry! Hurry and kill Valkyria! Chisato? I'm at my limit... We've failed. We couldn't make it in time. I can't believe Ichijiku would give up his life for someone else. Chisato! Chisato! Why did you save me? Why? The human heart can be a foolish thing. Sometimes we operate not on logic but on emotions. That's why I despise humans. Chisato? Chisato? Chisato! Chisato! He's dead! Chisato is dead! A world without Chisato? I'd rather destroy the whole thing! Oh, no! That's antimatter! Antimatter? She can make antimatter? Once it's been created, it will only disappear when annihilated in a matter-antimatter explosion. So then... This whole area will be obliterated! Kuroneko? Leave this to me. What are you saying?! It's okay. I can destroy the antimatter. How? With a micro black hole. A micro black hole? I'd planned on doing that when we grew up. Huh? I've always loved you, Ryota. And I always will, forever and ever. Ryota. Thank you. Don't ever forget me. Kuroneko! Kuroneko... All I wanted was to see Chisato happy. I was content just being with him. Sister. Let's end this. I'll go with you. Neko! You plan to die?! Sister, you and I... Together, we're one. My cute, dumb... little sister. Kuroneko? Kuroneko... Kuroneko! Kuroneko! I won't let go of this hand, even if it kills me! Kuroneko! Hang in there, Kuroneko! Thank goodness. It's all right now. You're not in any pain? Are you hurt? U-um... Can I ask you something? Sure. What is it? Uh, who are you? Hello? It's Kogoro. Ryota, we've made dramatic progress in reproducing the pills. Bring everyone over as soon as you get this message. Okay? I'm waiting for you. What's the matter? Why are you crying? A fertilized alien egg, eh? At the very least, it doesn't appear to be Homo sapien... Keep up the intelligence gathering. To Takachiho, Ichijiku's death is little more than a joke. Sorry we're late! Hatsuna, I swear. If you're gonna make me push the wheelchair all alone, quit going ahead! Hey, I was prepared to die again trying to help you. So keep the complaints to a minimum. More importantly, Kana can walk now, right? I'm still recovering. It's been a while since I've moved. But anyway, look. Such a beautiful, starry sky... Sure is. I wanted Kotori to see this, too. I know... The Summer Triangle! Huh? Neko! You... Your memories! I look up at the twinkling stars How I've always been enchanted by them Tomorrow, while having a dream I'll try being in love By asking for that which I don't have Everyone has their own happiness You taught me that, didn't you? I love that about you... Say... I've now fallen in love I asked the first star of night That somehow I could always be with you I know now for the first time Love is heartrending It brings pain But love is so very Look Something so warm
