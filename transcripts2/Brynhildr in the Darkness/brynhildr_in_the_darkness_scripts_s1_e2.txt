 I didn't want anyone to learn I was a witch. If they catch me, I'll be killed. So please... Don't tell anyone what I am. Wait, please! Hey! C'mon, wait! Don't come near me anymore. Like I said, I'm not your childhood friend. I'm a complete stranger. Goodbye. Witch Wow! Amazing!

 Vega, Deneb, and Altair are really clear today! It's the Summer Triangle, huh? We have our field trip next week. You've never seen the ocean, have you? Nope! Well, we're going to the beach, so you're looking forward to it, right? Not really. You can hardly wait, can you? No! This is training, just in case! But, Kuroneko... died without ever seeing the ocean. How many times... have I had this dream now? Kuroha didn't have Kuroneko's moles...

 But is she really a different person? Well, I can figure it out bit by bit. We're in the same class, after all. Kuroha is absent today? Well then, Murakami! Yes? Sorry, but could you take this transfer form to Kuroha after school? Huh? She has to hand it in by tomorrow. Her address says she lives near the observatory. Your club activities take you out there, so, please. Oh, that's right. Can you also take the guidebook for next week's summer trip? Are there really houses this far past the observatory? Why are Self-Defense Force armored vehicles out here? Did something happen? The address she gave was the lookout point?! Well, if some lab is after her, she wouldn't use her real address, would she? There's a village down there? Oh, right... It was going to be sunk by the dam, and was abandoned before the plan was scrapped. Actually, if I were going to hide... No Trespassing With a brush of her flowing dark hair... That voice! It's Kuroha! With a brush of her flowing dark hair... That voice! It's Kuroha! Leaping to action in an emergency! Leaping to action in an emergency! She helps those in trouble (In trouble!) She saves people who are gonna die! (Graaa!) The Cat makes her dashing appearance! She's the popular- Um... Kuroha. She's the popular- Um... Kuroha. What? You know... I didn't expect you to be happy and singing. What if I am? Why did you come all the way here? This. The teacher asked me to give you this transfer form. You have to turn it in by tomorrow. There's no need for that. Huh? Those who were going to die have been saved. There's no more reason for me to go to school. Hold on! That's the only reason you transferred in? That's right. Well, I was also a bit curious to see what school was like. I'd always wanted to go. For the 10 years I was in the lab, I was just their guinea pig for making a witch. They never let me study anything. So then... Then, you still have a reason to come to school! Come back to class tomorrow, Kuroha! Just leave me alone. You're bothering me. Kuroha... Why did you save me? That's obvious, isn't it? I can't sit and do nothing if I think I could save someone. I'm the same way. If those lab people catch you, they'll kill you, right? I can't sit and do nothing! Plus, I really doubt you can survive if you can't even do your multiplication tables. Multiplication tables are meaningless in daily life! Don't make it sound like it's calculus or trigonometric functions. You don't have to worry about me. In any case, I'm already- What's that sound? It's coming from that house. Don't worry about it. But that's a person, right? It's not. Help... me! It is a person! Help... me! Why would you lie about that? I'm not lying! It's not really a person's voice. Then I'll go see for my- Leave. Leave. I forgot to show her the guidebook. Kamakura Excursion Field Trip Guidebook I forgot to show her the guidebook. No Trespassing Kamakura is by the beach, right? What's wrong with me? She keeps pushing me away, but I can't help being interested in her. Is it because she looks like Kuroneko? Or because I still think she is Kuroneko? If she finds me, she'll think I'm a stalker or a weirdo for sure. It's okay. I had him leave. I think I frightened him a little too much, but it couldn't be helped. We can't get close to anyone. If I did get close to him... they'd kill him just as soon as I was caught. They'd kill me, too?! I'm fine. I'm not lonely or anything. In any case, we won't live long, so it's better not to make friends. "Won't live long"? What does that mean? As in, if she gets caught? Until then, we'll do what only we can do. Oh, no! It's time for our pills. I'll go get some water. Just who was she talking to? They didn't say a word back. Was she talking to herself? What the hell? This girl... She's not moving at all. Is she even alive? She seems just like a corpse. Or is this a well-made doll? Kana-Chan is alive. Sorry. I had to check things out for myself. Kana was one of their experiments to make a witch... But she ended up completely paralyzed. Huh? Still, in exchange, she acquired a powerful ability. A powerful ability? So, she's the one making the predictions? Yes. She can't use her own voice to speak, but the fingers on her left hand move a bit. She uses this keyboard to tell me what she's thinking. What you heard before wasn't human: it was the voice of this machine. It's malfunctioning, which is why it blasted that strange sound. So that's what it was? You pervert! Why did you sneak into my room? I thought I was going to be raped! You're just a two-face! How can you be a Peeping Tom and a two-face?! I saw you crushed under a rock, your organs splattered everywhere... I never thought you'd be such a pervert! Sorry. Kana is pretty harsh. Well, never mind this two-faced pervert. More importantly, Neko... I didn't know if I should tell you or not, but sure enough, I will. They got Kanade. No! Maki-Chan! Maki-Chan! They caught her... Kanade's been caught! "Kanade"? Who's that? A girl at the lab with us. She ran away, just like us. We have to go help her! Impossible. They already have her. There's nothing we can do. But! Neko. We don't even know where the lab is. Calm down and think. Kanade-Chan! Kuroha... Leave! Don't ever come back! I've got it! There's something you can do. Go to school. Have enough fun for the both of us. What are you saying? We don't have much time left. You should at least enjoy the present. Kana-Chan! Don't worry about me. If not for you, I would have died long ago. I'm grateful to you, Neko.

Could I have Kuroha-san come with me to the nurse's office? Huh? I'm sorry! C'mon, work with me. Wait a second! Sorry, Ma'am! I don't know what "ways" you used to get into our school, but if that's all the education you have, you'll get found out soon. What? Really? "Really?" You don't know multiplication tables or even how to read! How rude. I can read just fine. That wasn't even reading at an elementary-school level! Well, whatever. Let's just kill time here for a bit. It'll look strange if we go back too soon. Oh, yeah. I turned in the transfer form. I see. Did you look at the guidebook I dropped off with it? We're going to the beach next weekend. You'll come, right? I don't know. You don't know? Why not? That's up to me, isn't it? Why do you care so much? I told you about that girl I used to be friends with, right? She'd been looking forward to going to the beach. I told you, don't try to make me into her! I get it... But I still want to show you the ocean. I feel like that will make things up to her. CQ, CQ. Kana-Chan? Neko, I got a prediction. Someone else close to you will die! Who'll die? Where? At the curry shop near the station, a lady in red will be hit by a car in 15 minutes and die. Fifteen minutes? That's cutting it close! You plan to come with me?! You don't know where the curry shop is, do you?! Hey, watch out! Why are you running out like that?! I'm sorry. We're in a hurry. Sure you're not just stupid? This is why I can't stand kids! Why did she have to say all that? This is why I can't stand kids! Why did she have to say all that? We have to hurry. Right! Oh, no! Our 15 minutes are up! Ultra-manly curry now on sale Cheese meatloaf katsu We didn't make it! If we'd run faster, we might have saved her. I see. If you couldn't save them even though you knew, it feels almost as if you'd killed them yourself. That's why she can't just do nothing... Still, with an accident this bad, it's lucky no one died, huh? Yeah, I know. Um! What did you just say? The driver got distracted, but luckily there was no one on the sidewalk. The driver got distracted, but luckily there was no one on the sidewalk. My loan's not even paid off yet! My loan's not even paid off yet! What the heck? No one died? So Kana's prediction was completely off! That's strange. What could it mean? The lady on the bike from before... I've got it. I Know why no one died. Huh? She was the one who was supposed to have gotten hit. But when she almost ran into us before, it threw off the timing of the accident. I swear. If it weren't for us, those rubberneckers would be taking pictures of her right now. Don't say things like that. I'm just very glad no one died. Yeah. You're right... Where's Maki-Chan? What's happened? She has nothing to do with this! She's a normal human! Let her go! You know full well that if someone sees your magic, they - like you - cannot be allowed to live. Where are the other escaped witches? I don't know! I really don't know! We all scattered and ran! Eject it. No! Don't do it! I won't run away again! I won't, so please stop! Please! Noooo! You will find the other witches. I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I'm hungry, too. I'll go up to the mountains for a bit. No! No more wild herbs! Don't act spoiled. Hey. What's all the racket? Neko! Is that...?! What's that wonderful smell? Huh? How could you tell? I brought you some food. What is it? What are we having?! Yakisoba bread and stuff. Yakisoba bread?! And cakes and stuff. Cakes! Wait, can you even eat? O-of course I can! Otherwise, I'd die! Kana-Chan can't chew, but she can swallow. Say, can I see the cakes? Huh? Uh... sure. Kana-Chan, look. They're cakes! Ah, it's been 10 years! Such pretty cakes! They're cute! I guess they haven't had a decent meal since they escaped... Let's have some cake together. Hold on. You're gonna eat the cakes first?! Huh? The poor, cute cakes! Hey... If you can use a blender, you must have electricity. Yes, but there's no gas. We boil water and cook over wood fires. Wood? That was good, huh, Kana-Chan? Let's save the other cake for later. Um... That one's actually mine. Huh?! You're gonna cry? Hey! Don't make Neko cry! Okay, fine. Just eat it. Really? In that case, I'll save this for later. Good news, huh, Neko? What's this feeling? I wish I could stay here forever. Is it because Kuroha looks like Kuroneko? Sheesh. I must have really liked her... Thank you for today. Sure. Don't worry about it. I'll bring something again soon. Um, I... What is it? I... I'm going on the summer trip after all. Huh? But not for your sake! It's been a while, so I'd like to see the ocean. I see. I'll try getting used to school, too. It would be strange just to go on the trip, right? What happened to you? What? You got a problem?! No, that's not it. You're bleeding. Hey! You okay, Kuroha?! Kuroha... The next day, Kuroha didn't come to school.
