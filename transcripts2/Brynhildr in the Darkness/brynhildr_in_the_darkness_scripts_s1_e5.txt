 U-um... Did I fill out the entry form all right? Ah. Kotori Takatori, is it'? Y-yes! Are you all club members? That's right. I just joined today, though. W-wow! What a coincidence! I'm Kotori Takatori, a freshman. I don't have much experience, so I'd be grateful for your help! Hey.

 You've got some big ol' titties, huh? Seriously, what are these? P-please stop that! I'm self-conscious! Listen up, Kazumi. Huh? You go on about "booby fees" and whatnot, but you need boobs like these to make a fee worth- OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn Astronomical Observation You really need to tone it down! Oh, shut up! My nipples are prettier, no contest! U-um... Is this girl a member, too? Ah. She's... Well, damn. I didn't put her away.

 Don't treat me like some object! I'm not a student at your school. I'm more like a club mascot. And since I'm a mascot, it's only natural that I can't move. Huh? Care for me accordingly. Um, okay. And there's one more. Neko Kuroha. Hello! Ah, ma'am! Nice to meet you. So, what activities does the astronomy club do? Activities? Well, we mainly just look at the stars... Oh! But last year, the upperclassmen and I went stargazing up in the mountains. That sounds fun. I'd like to try that, too! Sure enough... Things have been pretty tough lately. This is our only time to have fun, while we still have pills to spare... Well, now that we have more members, what do you say we bond over some astronomical observation tomorrow? Huh? Are you free tomorrow? Um, yes! I'm free! You guys have nothing going on, right? Well, I'm free, but I have zero interest. I couldn't care less about stars. No, no way! You're all coming! If you want to stay here, you're coming! It's mandatory! The hell you think you are? Put a lid on it already. Y'know, you... You're a dummy, huh? What do you-? Ia man and a woman are together at night, why do they gotta look at the stars? There are other, more fun things they could do, right? Now look... Are you joking with me? I'm always serious. Wanna try starting things with a kiss? Huh? Wh-what happened? I didn't mean to do that, but my magic just... Wh-wh-what was that? What happened? Ah! Maybe it was a gremlin! A gremlin? A-anyway... We're having our observation party tomorrow. The mountains get cold at night even in summer. Be sure to come dressed warmly. What do you mean, "come"? We live here. Shh! Um, I have to get home early today, so... Ah. Well, see you here tomorrow at 6:00. Okay! Sorry, Neko. I have to use the bathroom. Okay. Hup! Why do you keep staring at Kana? Wanna watch her pee, do you? What? Are you a total idiot?! I was thinking Kuroha seems to have it rough, but obviously I can't help. Well, of course not. Anyway, if those are the kinds of "games" you're into, I don't mind showing ya. You know, you've been talking that sex stuff since yesterday... but you're a virgin, aren't you? S-so what if I am? Is there something wrong with that?! There's nothing wrong at all. But you don't have to force it, do you? I ain't forcin' it. I'm doing everything I can. Huh? To do what? What's it to you? Oh, that's right. I want to ask you something. Like what? How big my boobs are? That I already know. You're an A cup. But maybe you could squeak into a B with some padding. It's like Kana said before! Kuroha loses what's dear to her when she uses magic! It's her memories, right? I don't know the whole story, but apparently most of the memories she loses aren't too important. Still, if she's unlucky... If she's unlucky? She'll even lose the memories that she shouldn't. Neko was experimented on so much that she doesn't have a single childhood memory. She doesn't even remember her parents' faces. No childhood memories at all? What a great night. You can really see the stars. You should've just left me behind. Huh? Why? I'm heavy, aren't I? Not really. I'm used to it now. Pretty soon, you'll feel like the bag I take to school. What, you plan to keep on carrying me? What are you spacing out at? The Summer Triangle. "Triangle"? What's that? Vega from Lyra, Deneb from Cygnus, and Altair from Aquila. In the Tanabata story of star-crossed lovers, Orihime is Vega and Hikoboshi is Altair. See how they're shining from opposite sides of the Milky Way? Vega is the brightest one. Deneb and Altair are first-magnitude stars... but Vega is even brighter, with zero-point magnitude! Huh? How do I even know this? Maybe Kuroha really is Kuroneko... What the heck?! It's super cold! I said to dress warmly, didn't I? Yeah, but still! It's so cold! Well? Can you see? Yes. I can even see Saturn's rings! By the way, what made you want to join the astronomy club? Well, sure enough... because I'd like to see an alien, I guess. You believe in aliens, too? I wouldn't say I "believe" in them... I know that they're real. Huh? I've seen them for myself. A harnest! D-don't tell me you...! Come here a minute, Murakami! Now's not the time! Just get over here! What the hell? Come closer. I got a prediction. That Kotori girl is going to kill Neko. How will Kuroha be killed? I don't know. I couldn't see that far. Shit! There's not much I can do right now! I have to at least buy some time so the others can act! What's the matter? I had a prediction that Kotori kills you. What the hell?! So she's from the lab? What kind of magic does she use? If it's attack magic like Saori... Um, what's the matter? You're a witch, aren't you? H-h-how did you know?! I saw the harnest on the back of your neck. H-h-how do you know about harnests?! E-e-everyone who knows about witches gets killed! Hey, you're the one who came to kill a witch, right?! N-no! Besides, where are there any witches around here?! All three of us are witches. Whaaaaat?! R-really? Th-th-that's such... a crazy coincidence! Huh?! What a boldfaced lie! There's no way that could be true. Fine, then show us your magic. If you didn't come to kill us, you can do that much, right? Sure! Watch this! My magic is teleportation! Teleportation? Here goes! Huh? They changed places! Well? Amazing, huh? Kinda sucked. Whenever I use it, I always hang up. Useless! How could she kill Kuroha with that? Maybe she's a hybrid and is hiding some powerful, deadly magic! I would never kill anyone! Why can't you believe me? Still... It's not right to doubt her. Yeah, but still... You're the one who's gonna get killed! Fine. "Fine"? What the hell?! I want to use the telescope, too. Please. G-go ahead! Kuroha... The thought of this girl getting her feelings hurt is worse than that of her own death, huh? That's just like her. Okay, let's get back to our stargazing. Now's not the time for that, is it?! Or hen there's no problem. right? I'll fix it so you can see the moon. Hold on a second. Was Neko the only one who got killed? I only saw her. Well then, fine. I still don't trust her, but I'll stop doubting her for now. Here. That should do it. Wow! The moon looks so close! Huh? But it's upside-down... Images in astronomical telescopes are reflected upside-down. Oh, really? Kana-Chan! The moon is awesome! You can even see all its bumps and scrapes! Kuroneko would know how a telescope works... You can even see all its bumps and scrapes! Kuroneko would know how a telescope works... Come on, let's all look at it together! Still, maybe she's just forgotten. Come on, let's all look at it together! Still, maybe she's just forgotten. It's really cool! Still, maybe she's just forgotten. It's just the moon, right? Still, maybe she's just forgotten. I couldn't care less. What? You can see it this clearly?! I thought it'd be kinda underwhelming. Wow, you're right! There he is! I can see the man on the moon! Kazumi, what are you talking about? Don't mock me! I can see him! I want to see, too. Yeah... I thought this would be a nice change of pace. I want to see, too. Yeah... I thought this would be a nice change of pace. Hold on. Give me a second! Move aside already! Just a little longer... A little longer! It's like a dream. Going to school, being in a club... making memories like this! What's the matter, Kana? O-oh. It's nothing. That was fun. Well, it's not like we can't do it again. Murakami. Slow down a bit. Be honest... Whose life is more important, yours or Neko's? That's not much of a choice, is it? But if I could save Kuroha... My prediction just changed. Neko won't die. Instead, Kotori will kill... you. What?! Two... I guess I'll stay here tonight. I wonder how Kazumi and the others are... Oh. A kitty, huh? You have no home to go to, either? Okay, got it. We should escape together! School's already over? Yeah. I rode an earlier bus than usual. I want to ask you about yesterday's predictions, before Kuroha and the others get here. Fine. You have the right to know. Well, first off, where was Kuroha going to get killed? It was at a big lake. Near here, I think. I can't see predictions for faraway places. There's only one lake around here. Neko was dead, and next to her... Kotori was standing there, smiling. What about when the prediction changed? It was at the same lake. But Neko was alive. And instead... you were dead. So then, in either case, one of us will die? When will it happen? Probably tonight. Got it! Then for the rest of the day, we will not go near that lake! I've just voiced my absolute conviction. The forecast didn't change? Not at all. There must be some reason you have to go to the lake. I think this goes without saying, but we need to keep my prediction of your death from Neko. Otherwise, she'll do everything she can to save you. That could make the forecast change again. I don't care if you die, but I can't lose Neko. Yes, I get it. She just can't be upfront... If she really didn't care if I died, there'd be no reason to even mention the forecast. But she did, which means she's telling me to think of a way to save us both, me and Kuroha. Say, was there anything else that bugged you about the forecast? There was. When you were killed... Neko was tied up nearby. Tied up? So you're here? If you're going to leave first, you could at least say something. Sorry. We brought Kotori, too. There's a lot I wanna ask her. U-um... Okay, everyone. Have a seat. Did you run away from the lab, too? Y-yes, with Chie-Chan. Oh. I know Chie. She uses the same type of magic as me. Is she doin' okay? N-no. She died recently. Don't tell me you killed her for her pills! Me? Kill Chie?! Kazumi-Chan! According to Kana's prediction, this girl kills you! How can I not suspect her? E-e-even so, what can I...? What are you grinning about? You're a friggin' suspect! A-ah... Kotori was standing there, smiling. That's right. If all she wanted was to kill Kuroha and the others, she wouldn't need to enroll in school or join the astronomy club. So then... Could Kana have made a mistake? The heck? Who would be radioing me? Okay, okay. Yeah, what? Kazumi? Help me! That voice! It's Shino! Yes, it's me. Help me, Kazumi! There's a AA+ after me! AA+?! Two of us are already dead. If she finds me, I'm next! My battery's about to die. Please hurry! Shino-Chan, we're on our way. Neko! Where are you? The park by the lake! Got it. Oh, no! Murakami, stop her! Wait, Kuroha! Calm down! Move aside. There's no time. No! Kana's forecast takes place near the lake. I see. Now move. It's no good. Kuroha can't just leave a friend to die. I'm sorry. Wait! Damn! I have to follow her! Murakami. Take this. I'll back you up. Okay. Kotori left, too? She's the one who kills Neko! Ah, jeez. I've become a real sucker, doing all this for free. Now, then... True, it's to save this Shino girl... But as predicted, we ended up coming to the lake. Murakami. Can you hear me? Yeah. I hear you. Shino's not there. She's on the park's north side. Huh? You can see us? I see you just fine. I hacked the park's security cameras for my own personal use. In that case, I need you to find out if Kotori is here somewhere. Sure thing. Kotori, huh? If things go according to Kana's vision, Kotori should be at the lake, too. Kotori, Kotori... Oh, no! Hide! Huh?! Hide behind the stage to your right! Wh-what's going on? Just hurry up and do it! Kuroha, this way! I can't believe they'd send her out. This is bad. Neko, Murakami, come straight back! The one who's chasing Shino is Kikako! S-she's coming! Kikako! The battery's dead. Please, help me! Boat Rentals Boat Rentals Somebody... Boat Rentals Who the heck is "Kikako"? Kikako uses cannon magic. Even though she's AA+, she has just one type of magic. But that means her firepower is no joke. What's that? Get down! This is... She's the perfect weapon! We can't stay here. Huh? My magic won't reach unless we get closer. You're going to fight her?! All of us B-rank witches who escaped the lab are weak. That's why we have to help one another. We may not Say it out loud, but we all know it... That includes Kana-Chan and Kazumi-Chan. There's no way I could just abandon Shino! Thank you for worrying about me. Don't move from here, okay? Shino-Chan... Shino-Chan! I look up at the twinkling stars How I've always been enchanted by them Tomorrow, while having a dream I'll try being in love By asking for that which I don't have Everyone has their own happiness You taught me that, didn't you? I love that about you... Say... I've now fallen in love I asked the first star of night That somehow I could always be with you I know now for the first time Love is heartrending It brings pain But love is so very Look Something so warm OpenSubtitles recommends to be fit Reshape Weight Loss App: osdb.link/fit
