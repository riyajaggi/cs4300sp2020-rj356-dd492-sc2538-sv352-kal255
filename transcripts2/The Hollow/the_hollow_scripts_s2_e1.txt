 [theme music playing] [fan whirring] [inhales, grunts] Huh? [gasps] [pants] What the...? Mira? Kai? Am I really home or am I still in the game? Come on, give me some kind of clue! Anything!

 Huh? - Reeve? - [door creaks] [gasps] [gasps] Bring it! [panting] - [whimpers] - Puddles? [huffs] [sniffs, whines] You're here, too? Hmm... If this is real... Okay, Puddles, clean up, aisle three! [grunts, barks]

 [barks, pants] Okay, you got that one right. - [barking] - Hey, where are you going? - [clattering] - [gasps] Huh? [clattering continues] [barking] Huh? Mom? Is that you? [gasps] Oh, good, you're up. [chuckles] I was beginning to think I was making these banana nut pancakes for Puddles. Don't you get your hopes up, mister. New day, same story. Same story, same story. Dad? Son, did you just poke me? I thought... I'm sorry, I... It's just... why are you here? This is the last place I'd expect to find you guys. In our home? No, here in "The Hollow." As an avatar. Digital. See? Sorry, I don't follow. This looks like our house, but it's not. It looks like you, but... So let me get this straight, we're digital and none of this is real? Yeah, exactly! Well, that's great news because I did not want to finish grading these essays for Monday. [laughing] Where's Mira? She always comes over for pancake days. Yeah, she does, but I've gotta go find her. But your breakfast! Not hungry. Thanks, though. [door slams] [sighs] Hi, Adam. Glorious weather, huh? [chuckles] [panting] - [line ringing] - [grunting] Aw, did dum-dum A-dumb twip and fall? It... It can't be. Gavin Connors from Ms. Jacobson's class? But you're just like I remember you. - You haven't aged at all. - And you're old! How... How is it possible? I don't know. How is it possible that you're still a loser? - [kids laughing] - [Gavin] Oh! Come on, A-dumb. Fight me. Don't you know how to fight? [both] Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, - fight, fight, fight, fight, fight... - [whimpering] You're not even worth fighting. - [sighs] - But I'm gonna fight you anyways. Sorry, guys, gotta run! [panting, grunts] Hi, Adam. Glorious weather, huh? ♪ Dum-dum A-dumb, dum-dum A-dumb ♪ [panting] [grunting] I don't wanna hurt you. [kids laughing] Come on, uh, can't we talk it out? - This is gonna be fun. - [knuckles crack] Right, talking it out wasn't really our thing. [grunts] [grunting] [grunting] [sighs] [both] Whoa! [exhales] I still have my powers? Wow. Are you seriously scared of a couple of ten-year-olds? - Oh, dum-dum. - You can't stay up there forever! I can't believe this. Come on, Mira. Where are you? I'm just saying if we book off-season, we can make it a longer trip. I suppose I could piggyback my sick days onto vacation days. - Uh... - [boy] Hello! Earth to Mira! I said pass the salsa! Oh! Um, okay. Are you feeling all right, Meerkat? I... I hate that nickname. [man 1] Oh, she's just zenned out. You've been listening to that guided meditation I sent you, huh, Mira? Ah, one veggie burger for our favorite herbivore. This... This can't be real. No, duh, it's not real. You're a vegetarian, remember? One real burger for me, please. Not that. This. All of this. Why are you all in "The Hollow"? [chuckles] See? I told you guys she doesn't make sense. Miles, be nice to your sister. Something's wrong. I don't think I'm supposed to be here. [man 1] Honey, what do you mean? You're home. Home? I'm not home. Not by a long shot. Oh, oh! Uh... Can I go to Kai's place later? He's got a totally insane new gaming setup. Kai! I'll talk to the guys and we'll figure this out - in a calm, collected way. - [line ringing] [screaming] Huh? - Master Kai? - Sorry, Davis. Give me a minute here. [screaming] Come on, pick up, pick up! - [voicemail] Kai here. - Kai! Except I'm not here, so leave a message. Beep! - [phone beeps] - Ugh. Beyond annoying. All right, Mira, guess it's all up to you, as usual. - Mira, hold up for a second. - [scoffs] What's gotten into you? Is this supposed to be some sort of puzzle? I'm not really getting the gameplay. Mira, what are you talking about? If you were my parents, I'd tell you, but you're just weird digital copies. I might as well be talking to myself right now. [engine revs, tires screech] [man 1] Mira, wait! [doll] Don't you wanna play with me? [Mira screams] [pants, sighs] - As if my day needed to get any weirder. - [thunder crashes] [mewls] Yeah, that did come out of nowhere. [mewls] I know, right? Wait, I can still understand animals? May I offer Master Kai a chamomile tea to relax? Or perhaps a stress-relief piñata? Thanks, but no, thanks, Davis. The only thing I want right now is answers. Am I dead? This is some sort of dream, right? - Wait, did we even win "The Hollow"? - [thunder crashes] Pardon me, Master Kai. "The Hollow"? Regrettably, I am unfamiliar with such a thing. What? You know, "The Hollow"? You're always telling me I play too much. It reminds you of simpler times when youths could have fun with no more than a desktop computer and broadband internet. If Master Kai says so, I'm sure it's true. Don't just tell me what I wanna hear, Davis! Give me that "real" real! Tell me the truth, not as my butler, but as my friend. I'm touched, Master Kai. Or may I call you "sir"? Of course! So, tell me honestly. Is this real life? It is, sir, yes. - And we're not in "The Hollow"? - No. Then where are my parents? In Saint-Tropez, sir. They took the yacht to oversee the company regatta. That sounds right. You missed a call from earlier, sir. [Kai] Mira? - [thunder rumbles] - [phone beeps] [phone ringing] [thunder crashes] [doll] Mama. - [line ringing] - [tapping rhythmically] - [phone beeps] - Gah! Is this real life? [thunder crashes] [sputters] The rain is wet like real life. Will my torment never cease? [birds chirping] Now that is not like real life. If I want answers, I need to find my friends. - Shall I prepare sir's ride? - Yes. And Davis? I'll take that chamomile tea. The post office, the over-priced coffee shop, the vintage store, it's all here! Even, oh! Holy Donuts! And no waiting in line? Don't pinch me because I don't wanna wake up! [both grunt] [spits] Whoa! You're Gretchen Aguilar! Also, sorry for almost ruining your box of the world's best donuts. Am I right? Up top! [chuckles] Do I know you? Well, no, but I know you. I mean, you're totally famous! - Me? Famous? - Um, yeah. You only hold the record for the fastest victory in the history of "The Hollow." You single-handedly took down a giant, charged the power amulet, and freed your teammates in one fell swoop! I mean, heh, not that I dissected the play-by-play. So if you're here, does that mean we're on a team together? I think you have the wrong Gretchen. Now, if you'll excuse me. Weird. I guess fame really does change people. [thunder rumbles] - [birds chirping] - Hmm. This has got to be some kind of messed-up dream. - [stomach gurgles] - Ugh, the hunger is real, though. [doll] Mama. - [nails scratching] - Mama. - [thudding] - Mama. - Mama. - [whimpering] [echoes] Mama. - Huh? [grunts] - [car horn honks] [engine revs, tires screech] - Mira! - Kai? [tires screech] [gasps] Surprise, surprise. The world's falling apart and you're snacking. Mm, nice moves! We have to figure out what in the "hollow" is going on. But also, thank you. You remember "The Hollow"? You're the real Mira! That means I'm not losing my mind! So what are we supposed to do? First things first, we gotta find Adam. - [Adam] Help! - [Kai] Hmm? - [panting] - Get back here! Found him. Second things second, rescue Adam. [engine revs, tires screech] [panting] - Get on! - [tires screech] [kids grunting] Oh, now you're gonna get it! Go, go, go! - [tires screech] - [kids panting] [Gavin yelps] - Good to see you, bud. - You, too. Not sure I could handle an atomic wedgie on top of waking up in this crazy place. [chuckles] [sighs] Parting is such sweet sorrow. - Ooh, donuts! - Give me that! - That's mine! - No! - No! - Back up! Nice thinking! We've all gotta make sacrifices. Where to? We need to find a safe spot and make a plan. How about my place? Huh? You live here? [Mira] Whoa! [Kai chuckles] Oh, you know, in the winter. Did you know about this? I knew he was rich, but I didn't know he was statue-of-yourself rich. Uh, don't worry about that, heh. Come on. My thinking gazebo is over here. Thanks, Davis. [slurps] So you're one of those super-rich kids living life in a bubble, huh? No. You're thinking of my neighbor Kevin. Nice guy. Anyways, now you know why I was so hyper-stoked when you guys asked me to join your team. You treated me so normal. But then all this happened. What exactly is happening? I don't know, but something's definitely wrong. Do you think Gustaf's playing a trick on us? - Who? - You know, That Weird Guy. Eh, I just got so used to calling him Weirdy. Weirdy. We may not know what's going on, but there are a few things we know for sure, like who we are. I have all my memories. - Well, up until... - We jumped through the portal, landed in the white room, and pressed the green button? Uh-huh, same. And then what? I got nothing. Neither do I until I woke up at home. Well, not "home," but... Ugh, do boss battles mean nothing anymore? [slurps] I can't shake the feeling that this wasn't supposed to happen. Something's gone wrong. Like, really wrong. No one in this world seems to know about "The Hollow." Which would be normal in the game. Right, but things in this world feel different, more real. I don't know how to explain it, but my parents knew things about me that only my real parents would know. [sighs] I don't trust this place. I've got a theory. [both] We're not dead! Seriously, hear me out. What if we're still in the game? So this is like level two? "The Hollow" has never done that before. Right! So there's no way the teams would see it coming. That would actually be kind of an awesome twist. [imitates explosion] Mind blown. It would be awesome, except I thought we already won the whole tournament. But what if it wasn't really over? Like the end of a horror movie where you think it's over and everybody's happy and smiley at each other, and then... - ♪ Ree, ree, ree, ree! ♪ - Actually, that would explain... Care to share with the rest of the class? Those kids that were chasing me, they were my bullies from back in grade school. I never thought I'd have to face that fear again. But there they were, exactly how I remembered them. It's like they had some kind of hold over me. Luckily, I got away from them, thanks to my powers. Wait, we still have our powers? [grunts] Whoops! My bad, Davis. [chuckles] [coughs] Not at all, sir. It looks much better this way. So you're saying this place somehow brought your fears to life? - That makes perfect sense! - Does it? Yeah. When I was growing up, my aunt gave me this creepy doll. I was always sure it was haunted. And today, I keep seeing flashes of it. Everywhere I go, there it is, stalking me. Kai, have you seen anything? - Mm, nope. - What were you afraid of as a kid? I mean, I've always been pretty brave. No big deal. Really? There's nothing we should be keeping an eye out for? Yeah, nothing in particular. [sighs] Fearless or not, we need to talk to the one person who might actually know what's going on here. - Weirdy. - [chicken clucks, squawks] What was that? Oh, no. She's come for me! [ground rumbling] M-M-Mabel! - Mabel? - Who's Mabel? The giant chicken who terrorized my nightmares! Wait, m-m-maybe this is just a dream after all. [Mabel clucks] [Kai screams, whimpers] [clucks] [whimpers] [whimpering] - [clucks, squawks] - [lightning crackles] Kai, run! - [panting, grunting] - [Mabel clucking] Come on, upsy-daisy! [Kai grunts] - [Adam grunting] - [Mabel squawking] - [panting] - [Kai grunts] [clucks, squawks] [clucking] [squawks] - [Adam and Kai sigh] - Phew! [gasps] In there! First, the doll, then Adam's bullies, and now this? Why would our deepest, darkest fears come to life? It's almost like... like we're being used for some sort of psychological experiment. - But who would do that? - And why? [clucking, squawks] - If this is another level of the game... - It could still be a dream. Really leaning towards the whole depraved science experiment thing right now. - [rumbling] - [screams] No! [rumbling] [rumbling] [rumbling] Uh, ah... ah... [both] No! No, no! Ah! [muffled sneeze] - Whew! - [creaking] [sneezes] - [crashing] - [Mabel squawks] - [Mira whimpers] - [clucking] Stop! You don't have to do this. We can get you whatever you want. A nice coop? Bird seed? [clucking] She says she's just following orders. [clucking continues] And also, she really hates Kai. "Just following orders"? From who? No time! Run! [squawks] - [thunder rumbles] - [lightning zaps] - [panting, whimpering] - [clucks] She's only after me! Save yourselves! Hey, snap out of it! You're not a kid anymore and you're not alone! We're in this together.
