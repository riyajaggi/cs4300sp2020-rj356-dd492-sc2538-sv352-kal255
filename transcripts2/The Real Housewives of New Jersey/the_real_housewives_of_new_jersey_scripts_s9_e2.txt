I hope she doesn't go too deep and hit a nerve. - It's painful to be beautiful. Look, my mother's doing her facelift on Saturday. Now she's gonna be so tight and pulled and looking glamorous and fabulous, so that's gonna make me want to do it more. - Marge, you look perfect. - I know. - There's nothing you need to change on your body. - Okay. - Your face is more perfect. - A little more perfecter? [both laugh] I feel like a million bucks being with joe because I know he's so in love with me, and he's obsessed with me, but I think I still want the facelift. - Okay, you guys. - Ooh, hi. - Oh, boy. - Got your stencil ready. - Uh-oh. - Come on, brave man. - All right. - Oh, that's cute. - That fits good. - Yeah.

I am going away next week, that charity thing, the hospital heroes for the kids. - Mm-hmm, right. - I'm in the middle of working on a children's hospital gown line. Two years ago I was on the pediatric ward, and when I saw sick children all wearing these institutional-type gowns, and I said, "why would anybody want to wear these? Everything should really look like a costume." - this is just phenomenal. - If I could just bring a little bit of happiness to a child that's in the hospital and take their mind off of being sick for a little while, I will do it. - Your mother's staying at our house while she recoups? - Yes. - She's--you're not-- no! Joe, it'll be fine. - All right, you ready to see it? - Sure. - Let me see. Oh, it looks nice. This looks really nice. I love it. - Is that the right date? - Joe, will you stop?

[doorbell chimes] oh, they're here. [dog barking] put this away for me, gino. - Hi. - Hi. - Can I pet your dog? - Hi. - Oh, hi, how are you? - Can you say hi first? Hi. - I like outgoing children. - Hi. Hi. - Hi, how are you? - Good to see you. Hello. She's so outgoing. I love it. - I know. - Wait, so whose twin is she, your twin? - Yeah. - Wow. And then you two are twins? That's so cool. - Here, we brought cupcakes. - Oh, how nice. Thank you. - Thank you for having us. - No problem. Come on in. Oh, my god, wait, don't step in the--oh, my god. - Ew! - Ew, ew! - O-m-g. Are you kidding me? - Come here, come here! - Downstairs. - Wait, the kids all ran downstairs already? - I'm beast at this game. - I can beat you. - Ha, ha. - Oh, look, I'm so happy. They like each other. - I'll just--I'll pick you guys up tomorrow, okay? - Yeah. [laughs] - you want to--like, something to drink? - Are you drinking? - I'll have a glass of wine, especially since now our kids are besties and all. - I know, exciting. - I'm so happy. I was nervous. Before you got here, I was telling my kids, "be nice. I don't know if they can handle you." - no, no, no, not my children, 'cause they're, like, rough and tumble. - [yelps] - tell me the worst is when you have them all in the car together. - Yes. - Oh, my god, I want to pull-- - yes, I have, like, a swinging arm to the backseat. - Oh, my god! (bleep)! - I'm like, stop! - Put on your seatbelt! - I drive a minivan, and it's ugly, but I like it. And I go to clean out that minivan-- - that is so funny. - And I find that my kids let an ice cream cone melt into the cup holder. - You're like, "it's all good." - like, I don't ----ing give a sh--. - I think it's so cool. - I am the woman with the two sets of twins who drives the ----ing minivan. - Yes, girl, I like it. - And I own it! I own it. - So funny. - Having two sets of twins is ----ing madness. - [screams] - alexis, watch. Alexis. Excuse me! [kids shouting] after one round of ivf I had my first set of twins, but then I really wanted to try for a girl, so we did ivf again. And wouldn't you know it, another set of twins. What are you doing? It's not a bowl of cereal. - Can I have ginger ale? - Guys, stop. I wake up, and I'm like, "I'm not gonna yell at anybody today." everyone's gonna get a job. Don't fight over the job. Bring that tray into the dining room. Excuse me. I said him. Walk away from the pitas. Within five minutes I'm like, "I'll ----ing kill you." like, it's really--like, it's nonsense in my house. Alexis, get away from him now. Luckily my husband, evan, is the best father in the world. - Daddy. - Hi, da-da. - Hey, buddy. - He totally keeps me sane. These kids are never going to ----ing sleep. I need, like, this filled up with wine when we get home. He works finance in the city, and I work at home as a journalist writing articles about parenting. Joe, can you think of any articles for me to write? - Uh, cooking? - [soft laugh] I don't think I'm qualified. Parenting is a very loaded topic, so a lot of times people do not agree with my viewpoint, and I have gotten responses telling me I'm a terrible mother. Ah! - Ew, I got spit on. - That I don't know what I'm talking about, that I should leave the country. Put you in the suitcase with me. But if you don't like the way that I parent or anything about me, I cordially invite you to go (bleep) yourself. - Oh! - Oh! [screams] - don't cry. I got it. - Alexis, no! Alexis! - Oh, no! - Oh, my god, you're so wild. I'm really sorry. I will help you clean up after. - It's fine. Me and my sister-in-law, when she would come over with her kids, you had to see the house 'cause it was, like, a disaster. - Yeah. So teresa's married to your husband? I mean, teresa's-- - so I'm married to teresa's brother. - Right, okay. - Yes. But years ago, we really used to butt heads. - I wouldn't have guessed because you guys get along so well now. - You know what? It was a horrible, horrible time in all of our lives, so we'll never do that again. - Oh, no! - Is everything okay in there? - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't want you putting that upside-down and putting it all over the place. - [shouts] - whoo-hoo! - Oh, my god. This is a nuthouse. - Okay, we live the same life. We're the same person. [hip-hop music] - are you gonna fall out of the car? - [laughs] - come on. - Hi. - Two manicures, and he wants to get a pedicure. - Guys, you can come with me this way. - Come on, nonno. Speed-walk. - You want to pick out your nail colors first? - Nonno, maybe you should get pink. - [laughs] - I think I like this color. - All right, all set? - Yes. - Okay, you can come with me. Enjoy your services, ladies. - Thank you. - Thank you. - That's it, ah. - Oh, me and audriana leave Friday for her dance competition. But Sunday we're having easter. - Oh, yeah. - This is the first holiday I'm hosting since the loss of my mom. Even though my dad's still grieving, I think being around your family, that helps. Let me see your tattoo. - Did you lose your mom? - It's pretty. - Yeah. - Papa, look. She lost her mom, and that's her mom's signature. I want to do that. - Yeah, he doesn't like tattoos. - I know. I went with you. [somber music] - I feel bad for nonno. Like, he's lonely. Like the other day he was complaining about my brother not being around. - [speaking italian] - you're upset that he hasn't called you? - Yeah, yeah. - I mean, I understand that he works a lot, you know? - No, but that just excuse is, like, so old. We live in the same town. - You're right. He could even stop over to have a glass of wine and then go home, you know? - Yeah. Nonno would love that. - My brother used to be around more when my mom first passed away, but now he's not coming around. And I'm really nervous to say anything to him 'cause when I brought this up to my brother in the past, it got ugly. - You're in mommy's and daddy's ear every day. Shame on you. - You should be there for daddy. - Was I around a lot? - No. - Okay, well, (bleep) you, bitch. - My brother and I have been doing really well for a while now, and I definitely don't want history to repeat itself. I mean, life is short. I just don't want my brother to have any regrets. - Heh, I'm ready. [both laugh] - you're so cute, nonno. - Coming up... - What the (bleep) is so important about you being friends with dolores catania? What is it that you really have in common? You cheated on your husband, she got cheated on? We often have to choose between the beauty products - your eyes are so blue today, frank. - Compliments are not gonna get you a bigger budget. - [laughs] - okay? What do you want to do? Give me your vision so I can try to work with you here. - I want to go with, like, a spa vibe because it's a lake house, you know what I'm saying? - Okay. - Simple. That's what people like. - This is what I would normally use, okay? - Listen. - You don't like it? - I don't want that in that house. - Okay, all right. You got it, okay. - Okay? - What about the gray? Any chance? - What are you doing with that? Put it away. Don't even show me one more thing of that. - What are you talking about? Let me tell you something. Since you don't like my borders, I'm just gonna sit here and hold my ----ing dick. - Do you want to fight, frank? - All right, if nobody comes to this house and doesn't buy it because you picked the damn tile. - Every day frank and I are figuring out how to work together better as partners in this business of flipping houses. - Hardwood floors throughout the house, refinished, and this is gonna be natural. - Natural? In, like, a light brown? - What color you want? - I want, like, a gray. - No, you're not--no, see, you can't do it in this house. What about, like, this for the master bath? - Yeah, and then you have the stone. I like that. - That's what you want? - Yeah. - All right. Now we got that. - But you know what? It was a really important first step that frank and I had a talk about him withholding the fact that he was disbarred. I was very upset when you got disbarred and you didn't tell me. I made it very clear to him I need total trust and transparency. Don't lie to dolores. So melissa's party was such a good time, frank. - What happened with danielle? Did you guys talk? - Like, hello, goodbye, that's it, because you're a troublemaker, danielle. You're a troublemaker. Last year she was busting our chops that we lived together. This year she's busting my chops about our situation. Even margaret said, "you don't talk about somebody's livelihood. I don't like that." - yeah? - Yeah. - She said that? - Yeah. So I asked margaret to go to this hatchet throwing thing. I'm inviting a bunch of people to a hatchet throwing. - With an axe, like, a hatchet? Oh, my god, that sounds so fun. - So come. - All right. We can get out our frustrations. - You know, she said, "I'd love to start off on a clean slate." - I think that's great. Why? - I'm ambivalent about it because I don't understand why she has such a soft spot for danielle. - Listen, you know it's only a matter of time before danielle does something to her. It's gonna happen. - I tried--nothing that-- - it's inevitable. You know that. - Yeah. - It happens with everyone with danielle. - Everybody. - So give margaret an opportunity, and go from there. [light music] [doorbell rings] [dog barks] - who's that, baby? Who's that? - Oh, I'm on the wrong side. Hi, boo. - Hi. - Look how cute you look. I'm like-- I'm like, what's going on? - How are you? - You look adorbs. - Come on in. You want me to take your coat? Ooh, is that okay? - Yeah. Hold on one sec. I'm so, like-- - want coffee? - Uh, a little cup of tea. Is that all right? - Tea? Yeah. What kind of tea? And I'm gonna do a little positive energy. - All right, a little positive energy tea. I like it. - [laughs] it's either that or stress. - I know. It's so crazy with the whole wedding. - Yeah. So last night was kind of strange 'cause, you know, I didn't have any conflict with dolores. It's like, if I stay awa-- out of her way and she stays out of mine, I think we're fine. So I don't know what else to say other than I just don't think everyone's meant to be friends. - I think you're absolutely right. - Dolores and I just--we rub each other the wrong way. - Yeah. - If we can be around each other and not make our friends, our mutual friends uncomfortable, then I'm good with that. - Um, actually, don't have a freak-out. She's having a hatchet throwing party. - Why would that freak me out? - No, I'm just saying 'cause she invited me and the other girls. ♪ ♪ - hmm. When did you two become buddies? - You know what? I said to her, and she said to me also, "let's bygones be bygones." we're also in the same circle. And, you know, she's not gonna say anything negative-- - don't you think it's kind of weird that you're my close, close friend, and you're gon-- - you're one of my best friends in the world. - Well, I'm gonna tell you it really bothers me that you're going. You don't have my back right now. [tense music] - it's not not having your back. - You're my friend. You shouldn't be going. - Danielle, are you kidding me? We are grown adults. This isn't fricking high school. You're allowed to have other friends. I mean, we are not a package deal. We're not conjoined twins. We're not ----ing twinkies. Okay, how do I say this? Danielle, I don't want to do anything to ever hurt you. She invited me to this thing... - And you could have said, "no, I'm not coming "because that will make danielle very upset and very hurt. It'll hurt her." - you want the truth? - Because you could have said, "this would hurt me if the tables were turned." - but it wouldn't! It wouldn't! - You could have said anything but, "yes, I'll come!" - oh, my god, danielle. - It hurts me. - Oh, my god. - What is it that you two really have in common? You cheated on your husband, she--she got cheated on? I mean, seriously? What the (bleep) is so important about you being friends with dolores catania when it-- - why do always hit below the belt when you're upset? Why do you get so hostile? - Why do I? Because I'm being hurt right now. This is what I do when I'm hurt. - Ah--all right. - It's what I do when I'm hurt. - Okay, that's--see? Nor--other people would be having a hemorrhage at you. I'm just gonna let you scream at me. - Other people don't get this side of me because I don't care about other people as much as I care about you. - Do I want danielle to be heartbroken? Of course not. - I'm the kind of friend that wouldn't do that to somebody. - Danielle has always been loyal to me since day one. And I love her, and dolores and I, we didn't have the best history. But you know what? She's devastated. She's so hurt. I mean, these girls are hurt. - Shut up, margaret. - But mending things with dolores should not affect danielle and myself. One relationship has nothing to do with the other. It's ridiculous. Listen, I love you. I'm with you all the time. - [sniffles] I'm done, margaret. I'm done. - Listen, I wouldn't even think-- - I don't want to talk anymore. - Okay. ♪ ♪ oh, that's her phone. Oh, god. - Coming up... - I feel like we need to get some aggression out.

I'll be your throwing coach. - You look like you throw axes. Are you good at it? - I'm an axe-pert. - [laughs] - this is your pit, and I'll show you the two ways that we throw the hatchet. So this is the double-handed throw. Oh, you can ring the bull's-eye bell when you hit a bull's-eye. And then the single hand. Have you ever thrown anything where you step-- - yeah, I've thrown things at men, only. - Well, that's not fun. [both laugh] both: Hi. - How are you? How could you be the first one here with five kids? - Am I? I should get a medal for that. I brought some snacks. - Oh, thank you. You didn't have to do that. - Yummy, yummy snacks. - Wait till you see how fun this is. Watch this. - Oh, you put a little more ass into it. - I have a lot of ass. - Hi. - Oh, melissa gorga's here. - I'm here with my fruit.

That was close. - I think that's the first I've ever seen that. - Yay! - You were like this. - I know, like a-- - okay, so let's have a toast. - Yes, let's have a toast. - I feel like something's missing, but it's teresa's not here. - She had to go to a dance competition with her daughter. - Okay. - What are we toasting? - Toasting to a ladies night out. - Ladies night out. - I feel like we need to get some aggression out. - Yeah. - You know what? We're gonna all think about something that we want to throw out of our lives, something that you want to change about yourself. You can't put this in words, but, like, now that my kids are gone, it's just me and my dogs. Frank's in florida most of the time, so I'm like-- - empty nest to the tenth power. - Empty nest to the tenth power. - Throwing the hatchet. - I'm throwing it out of my... [laughter] hold on. Okay, I'm throwing this at everything that's ever held me back. [all cheer] - it's a sign! - [laughs] - good job. - All right, who's next? - Okay. I've had five kids. I fluctuate with my weight constantly. Maybe I can start working out. - Girlfriend, there is no excuse for you. - I know! - You have a nanny. - Times two! - [laughs] - [ululating] - my values and cultural traditions are a little bit different than your typical jersey girl. [speaking turkish] I was born in queens, new york, but my parents, when they came here, still wanted me to marry somebody within our culture. Growing up, you guys were so strict. You didn't let me do anything. My mother was like, "what do you want? You want the club guy? You're not gonna get it all." and I used to say, "I'm gonna get it all." it was so frustrating. - Yeah, but in the end you are happy, you find bill. - My husband's name is actually nebil, but we all call him bill for short. He was born and raised in turkey. My husband's old-fashioned. He doesn't like cleavage. He doesn't like anything short. - Are you serious? - Yup. - I'm home. - Hey, baby. He's a plastic surgeon, so, you know, I enjoy a little bit of luxury. Bill, if you're home, can you come to the bedroom? We just moved into our new home. It's spectacular. It has nine bedrooms, a movie theater, a gym, a spa, 16 bathrooms. Yes, I know 16 bathrooms is a lot, but that's what the architect told me to do. And I really wanted an indoor basketball court because who wouldn't? - What's for dinner? - Roasted chicken. - What's for dinner? - Ew! I hate... - Roasted chicken. - Roasted chicken! - We have five kids. - I hate roasted chicken. - Chicken! - Okay, can everybody quiet? They're ages 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. I'm fertile myrtle, you know? They kept coming out. The past 15 years of my life have been all about my husband and my kids. Should I give you to baba or no? - No. - So now I want my own identity that's not, you know, the plastic surgeon's wife. [clicks tongue] all right, I'm throwing the hatchet. - Okay. - Let's go. - Throw the hatchet at making excuses! - Oh. - Little high. - One more, one more. - Almost got it. - You got it. [groans] - damn it! [laughter] it's very hard. Oh, my god. - Hold on, show me--let me take a picture of you. - By the way, dolores, I didn't want to post any photos because I was at danielle's yesterday. And I said, "oh, tomorrow I'm going to dolores's," and she was so upset I was coming. She ran out of the room crying, and she said, "what do you have in common with dolores? You cheated on your husband, and frank cheated on her?" - [gasps] - oh, my god. - She called you a cheater? - She said it point-blank. - Does the low blow that danielle said to margaret surprise me? Um, no. Did it surprise margaret? I bet it did. Maybe everyone's going to start to realize that I've been right. Danielle will never change. - And are you upset right now? - I felt bad 'cause she felt b-- - this is the way she acts. Professional victim. You can't give it any merit. - No, I know, but the truth is I'm having a ----ing mental breakdown. My mother's getting a facelift, and I'm leaving to go fly out to oklahoma. - Really? I didn't know that. For what? - I'm putting together this concept called hospital heroes. Two years ago I was getting my gall bladder removed. I was on the children's hospital ward. It was very depressing 'cause I was with all kids that were terminally ill. So I came up with this idea, hospital gowns that look like costumes. I'm very emotional when it comes to kids. - This is the first time I'm seeing this side of margaret, and I like it. I totally want to be a part of this whole thing. - If you guys want to come with me to oklahoma... - Oh, my god. - I'm gonna do a little business. But my girlfriend polly, she was in the kids business, and I wanted to bounce these ideas off of her. But she also lives on a ranch. - Oh. - So would you guys want to go? - I am 100% in for oklahoma. - I've never been away without my husband, without my kids. - What? Are you kidding? - Never. - We need a little break. - Yeah, I'm very excited. - I know. - Yeah. - It'll be fun. I'll call teresa. I don't know how she's gonna feel about it. - We're going to oklahoma, ladies. - She needs this. - I'm ready, girls. Throw the ----ing hatchet. Throw that ----ing hatchet! [all cheer] - ring the bell! Ring the bell! Ring that bell! - That was amazing. - No, shake it, shake it. - Shake that rope thing. [bell clanging] - oklahoma, here we come! - Coming up... - You can't be bullsh---ing on your cardio, because right now you're standing there like a pile of sh--. [light music] - can you open this? - Okay. [can cracks] don't spill. - Not too late for caffeine? Did we get permission for that? - I saw christian drinking it. I grabbed one, and then olivia asked me to open hers. - You should be asking an adult. Hey, baby. What's for dinner? - Shrimp with vegetables. - That sounds delicious. So how was last night? - Oh, the hatchet throwing? - Yes. - It was good. It was fun. Margaret actually invited all of us to go to oklahoma for the weekend. What do you think about that?
