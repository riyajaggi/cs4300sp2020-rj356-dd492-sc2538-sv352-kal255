 The Civil War (1990): Season 1, Episode 2 - A Very Bloody Affair (1862) - full transcript 
 By 1862, both sides had 1 million men in uniform across a 1000 mile battle front ranging from Manassas, Virginia to Missouri. Battles had taken a horrendous toll in human lives on both sides. Lincoln and his Cabinet were frustrated by the slow pace of the war and with Gen. George B. McClellan who apparently did not want to engage the enemy. The eventual attack on the Confederate capital, Richmond - by transporting Union troops by boat to the peninsula southeast of Confederate capital - was met by stiff resistance from a force one-tenth its size. McClellan dug in at Yorktown and the battle dragged on. Meanwhile, the South had a new weapon in the form of the Merrimack, the first ironclad ship far more powerful that anything the North had immediately available but they eventually responded with the Monitor, which won the epic battle of iron ships when the Merrimack withdrew. In the West, Union Gen. U.S. Grant won two crucial victories and enhanced his reputation as well by demanding unconditional surrender. Although the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 resulted in a Union victory, that was certainly not obvious at the end of the first day. Adm. David Farragut went down the Mississippi and claimed New Orleans, splitting the Confederacy in two.

 CUT. SOUND'S ROLLING, SPEED. CAMERA'S ROLLING. SLATE? TAKE ONE. KEN BURNS: SHELBY, SUMTER SEEMS TO BE A—-A CURIOUS BEGINNING FOR A WAR, FOR AVERY BLOODY WAR. CAN YOU--CAN YOU PAINT IT FOR ME, TELL ME ABOUT SUMTER? UH... THERE WAS NOTHING ALL THAT, UH, UNUSUAL ABOUT IT AS A FORT. UH, IT WAS A PENTAGON, WHICH IS KIND OF INTERESTING. WE HAVE PENTAGONS NOWADAYS. IT WAS...|T—-|T WAS A LONG HISTORY

 ABOUT HOW THEY MOVED FROM ONE FORT TO THE OTHER AN D--AND ALL THAT. BUT SUMTER-- THE UNUSUAL THING ABOUT IT IS HOW IT STOOD THROUGHOUT THE WAR UNDER BOMBARDMENT UNTIL FINALLY IT WAS JUST RUBBLE. IT WAS A LITTLE BIT LIKE WHAT WE DID TO MONTE CASSINO IN ITALY. IT WAS A—-|T BECAME AMORE EFFECTIVE FORTRESS THE MORE THEY KNOCKED IT TO PIECES. UH, IT'S A STORY ALL ITS OWN. THE WHOLE STORY OF SUMTER THROUGHOUT THE WAR WOULD BE INTERESTING, BEGINNING WITH THE BOMBARDMENT. SO MANY WELL-KNOWN BRITISH--JESUS. UH, ENGLISH, AMERICAN, UNION GENERALS WERE AT SUMTER. IT'S SURPRISING HOW MANY THERE WERE. THE POINT I'M TRYING TO HIT IS THAT NOBODY WAS-- NOBODY WAS KILLED THERE, TOO. NOBODY WAS KILLED UNTIL THEY WERE FIRING THE SALUTE TO THE COLORS AS THEY RETIRED, AND THAT WAS THE FIRST MAN TO DIE IN THE CIVIL WAR. A SOLDIER WAS KILLED BY A POWDER EXPLOSION DURING THE FIRING OF THE, UH, SALUTE TO THE COLORS AS THEY LEFT THE FORT. YOU SPOKE ONCE ABOUT-- WE REALLY BLUNDERED INTO WAR, THAT ONE--PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WE WERE GOING TO WIPE UP WITH A HANDKERCHIEF. CAN YOU TELL ME THAT STORY? UH, THERE IS A--A... A CONGRESSMAN, I BELIEVE, FROM ALABAMA--|'VE FORGOTTEN WHERE FROM-- WHO SAID THERE WOULD BE NO WAR. AND HE OFFERED TO WIPE UP ALL THE BLOOD THAT WOULD BE SHED, UH, WITH A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF. UH, THAT--THAT WAS HIS PREDICTION. I'VE ALWAYS SAID SOMEONE COULD GET A PhD. BY CALCULATING HOW MANY POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS IT WOULD TAKE TO WIPE UP ALL THE BLOOD THAT WAS SHED. BE A LOT OF HANDKERCHIEFS. WHAT DID LINCOLN'S ELECTION DO IN 1860? WHAT DID IT FINALLY DO? |T--|T DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT FROM A NORTHERN POINT OF VIEW OR THE SOUTHERN POINT OF VIEW. IN SOUTHERN MINDS, IT MEANT THAT THE UNION WAS GOING IN DIRECTIONS THAT THEY DID NOT CARE TO GO. SOME OF THAT WAS SIMPLY HAVING THEIR NOSES OUT OF JOINT. UH, I'VE FORGOTTEN THE FIGURES, BUT, UH, OF THE FIRST 15 PRESIDENTS, SOMETHING LIKE 10 HAD BEEN SOUTHERN. NOW YOU'RE GETTING A BUNCH OF NORTHERN PRESIDENTS. BUT MOST PARTICULARLY, THEY SAW THE COUNTRY... TELEPHONE RINGS AS BEING RADICALIZED OR, UM...PERHAPS BETTER PUT, BECOMING, UH, "ABOLITIONIST." UH, AND IT SEEMED TO THEM TO THREATEN THEIR VERY EXISTENCE-- WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK AND SAY THAT? TH EY—-TH EY SAW THE CAN--THE COUNTRY BEING RADICALIZED, AND SORT OF-- IT'S 'CAUSE OF THE PHONE. RIGHT. UH... SOUTHERNERS SAW THE ELECTION OF LINCOLN AS A SIGN THAT THE UNION WAS ABOUT TO BE RADICALIZED AND THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO BE TAKEN IN DIRECTIONS THEY DID NOT CARE TO GO. THE ABOLITIONIST ASPECT OF IT WAS VERY STRONG, AND, UH, THEY FIGURED THEY WERE ABOUT TO LOSE WHAT THEY CALLED THEIR "PROPERTY" AND FACED RUIN. UP UNTIL THAT TIME, SOUTHERN CAPITALISTS HAD BELIEVED THAT THEY HAD A COMPANIONSHIP WITH NORTHERN CAPITALISTS, AND THIS SAWA DIVISION IN THOSE RANKS, TOO. UH, SOUTHERN CAPITALISTS SAW THAT THEIR PROBLEMS WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM NORTHERN CAPITALISTS' AND THAT THEY WERE FIXING TO BE "SOLVED," 80 TO SPEAK, IN WAYS THEY DID NOT WELCOME. AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT CAUSES OF SECESSION. THE MEN HAD AN EXPRESSION WHEN THEY WENT TO WAR. I MEAN, THESE WERE YOUNG FARM BOYS, NORTH AND SOUTH, ABOUT AN ELEPHANT. WHAT--WHAT IS THAT STORY? OH, THEY SIMPLY, UH-- THE "ELEPHANT" WAS THE THING THEY SPOKE OF AS COMBAT EXPERIENCE. THEY CALLED ABOUT "SEE THE ELEPHANT," OR SOMETIMES THEY WOULD CALL IT "MEET THE ELEPHANT." UH, WHY THEY SETTLED ON THAT, I DON'T KNOW. IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO FIGURE OUT THE SLANG IN WARTIME. WE HAD MANY SUCH THINGS IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND, I'M SURE, IN ALL OTHER WARS. BUT IT WAS CALLED, "YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE ELEPHANT." "YOU'RE GOING TO MEET THE ELEPHANT." BUT IT JUST MEANT A MONSTER. THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT ABOUT THIS WAR WHEN-- AFTER SUMTER WAS FOUGHT. UM, CAN YOU COLOR THE EARLY MOBILIZATION FOR US? I MEAN, THERE REALLY WAS EXUBERANCE. PEOPLE WANTED TO FIGHT. WELL, UH, YOU HAD A COUPLE OF CONTRIBUTING THINGS. IT HAPPENED SOMETIMES IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR THAT A—-A-- A NATIONAL GUARD UNIT WOULD BE CALLED OUT. AND THAT MEANT THAT, UH, 200 OR 300 YOUNG MEN FROM THIS TOWN WOULD BE LEAVING, AND THEY USUALLY HAD A BANQUET TO LEAVE AND THERE WAS--PEOPLE MADE SPEECHES TO THEM, TELLING THEM TO KEEP THEIR POWDER DRY AND ALL THAT. AND THAT HAPPENED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, NORTH AND SOUTH, AT THE TIME OF THIS WAR. MILITIA UNITS, OR JUST VOLUNTEERS IN LARGE NUMBERS, UH, ASSEMBLED AND WENT OFF TO WAR. AND THERE WAS A—-A--A...A FEELING THAT THEY WERE HEADING INTO A GREAT EXPERIENCE. THERE WAS A FEELING ON BOTH SIDES THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SAVE THEIR COUNTRY, MEANING THE TWO COUNTRIES. UH, THERE WAS ALL THAT EXUBERANCE, UH, AND A SENSE OF A GREAT ADVENTURE LYING AHEAD. IT WAS A...|T--|T--|T-- THAT ASPECT OF IT IS, UH-- IS VERY PARTICULAR TO THAT WAR. UH, CIVIL WARS ARE--ARE--ARE NOTORIOUS FOR BEING, UH, CRUEL AND BLOODY. UH, AND THAT SIDE OF IT HADN'T COME TO THEM. IT WAS IF THEY WERE GOING TO ENGAGE IN A FAMILY ARGUMENT VOCIFEROUSLY. AND, UH, THERE WAS THAT--THAT TO IT. AND THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO LAST VERY LONG? NO. NO ONE THOUGHT IT WOULD LAST LONG. NO ONE, ON EITHER SIDE, THOUGHT IT WOULD LAST LONG. THOSE FEW INDIVIDUALS WHO SAID THAT IT WOULD-- UM, TECUMSEH SHERMAN, FOR INSTANCE, UH-- WERE ACTUALLY JUDGED TO BE INSANE FOR MAKING PREDICTIONS ABOUT CASUALTIES, WHICH WERE ACTUALLY LOW. WHERE WAS YOUR MAN FORREST IN 1861 WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT? AND REMEMBER, |--| DON'T KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT. UH, FORREST WAS RIGHT HERE IN MEMPHIS. HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF ALDERMEN, A—-A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE WEALTH, WORTH ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS. THE WHOLE NOTION THAT FORREST WAS AN |LL|TERATE COUNTRYMAN WHO CAME INTO THE WAR, UH, |S--|S VERY MUCH MISTAKEN. UH, IF YOU HEARD FORREST SPEAK, UH, YOU MIGHT ASSUME THAT HE WAS NOT VERY SMART OR CERTAINLY NOT EDUCATED. UH, YOU MIGHT THINK THE SAME THING OF ME. UH, FORREST SAID-- WHAT HE PROBABLY SAID WAS, "I ALWAYS TRY TO GET THERE FUST WITH THE MOST." UH, AND WHEN HE SAID, "FUST," THAT WOULD INCLINE YOU TO THINK THAT HE PROBABLY WAS NOT WELL-EDUCATED. UH, HE WAS NOT WELL-EDUCATED IN A FORMAL SENSE, BUT HE HAD ENOUGH BUSINESS SENSE TO MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS WHEN A MILLION DOLLARS WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY. I'M PARTICULARLY STRUCK BYA KIND OF CLOSENESS AND CAMARADERIE AMONG MEN THAT'S VERY MOVING AND POIGNANT. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT? I MEAN, EVEN IF IT'S JUST RESTATING WHAT I SAID? UH, THE CAMARADERIE AMONG THE SOLDIERS ON BOTH SIDES, UH, WAS ATHING THAT, UH, WAS BOUND TO DEVELOP. UH, THOSE MEN LIVED TOGETHER. THEIR LIVES DEPENDED ON EACH OTHER. UH...|N A GREEN UNIT, YOU'D HAVE TO LOOK TO YOUR LEFT AND RIGHT TO SEE WHETHER THE OTHER MEN ARE KEEPING UP WITH YOU. IN A SEASONED UNIT, WHERE PEOPLE HAD SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME TOGETHER, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT, UH, AND YOU LIVED OUT OF BATTLE, UH, IN VERY, VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY, INCLUDING-- IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY, AT LEAST--TO YOUR OFFICERS. UH, THEY WERE REAL, UH, CLOSE UNITS, ESPECIALLY THE REGIMENT. YOU MUST REMEMBER, THEY WERE ALL FROM THE SAME STATE. UH, THEY HAD FOLLOWED THE SAME FLAG. THE BATTLES THEY HAD FOUGHT IN, THE NAMES WERE STITCHED ON THAT FLAG. AND IT WAS A GREAT DEAL OF UNIT PRIDE, AND I'M SURE THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF SADNESS OVER THE LOSSES THAT THEY SUFFERED. UH, BUT THERE WAS A CLOSENESS AMONG THOSE MEN THAT CAME FROM YEARS OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE MOST HORRENDOUS WARFARE THAT I KNOW OF. THERE'S ALSO A PARTICULAR INNOCENCE, TOO. WE'VE GOT A GUY NAMED ORVILLE WILLIAMS-- MAN: CAN WE STOP FOR A MINUTE? DO YOU WANT TO STOP? SURE. I'M SORRY. SECOND MAN: CUT. CAMERA'S ROLLING. SLATE. TWO. UM, WHAT'S THE "HOOTY OWL" STORY? OH. EARLY IN THE WAR, THERE WAS A CONFEDERATE VETERAN, A—-A YOUNG COUNTRY BOY, ON GUARD DUTY. HE'S WALKING HIS POST IN THE WOODS. AND THERE WAS AN OWL, UH, UNKNOWN TO HIM, |N ATREE NEARBY. AND THE OWL SAID "WHOO?" AND THE BOY, TREMBLING WITH FEAR, SAID, "IT'S ME, SIR, JOHN ALBERT, A FRIEND OF YOURS." BOTH CHUCKLE DIDN'T THEY ALSO, THE VETERAN TROOPS, REALLY TRY TO SCARE THE YOUNG RECRUITS BY UNCOVERING-- WHAT WAS THAT? OH, THERE'S A STORY, UH, THAT, UH, WHEN GRANT BEGAN HIS SPRING CAMPAIGN IN '64, HE TOOK WHAT THEY CALLED "THE HEAVIES," THE HEAVY ARTILLERYMEN, OUT OF THE FORTS IN WASHINGTON AND PUT THEM IN THE FIELD. AND MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN IN THE ARMY 2 OR 3 YEARS AND NEVER HAD HEARD ASHOT FIRED IN ANGER. AND AS THESE UNITS MARCHED INTO CAMP, THEY WERE SO MUCH LARGER THAN THE COMBAT REGIMENTS THAT, UH, SOLDIERS ALONGSIDE THE ROAD USED TO SAY, "WHAT DIVISION IS THAT?" THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM. BUT THEY HAD SOME FIERCE THINGS. THE FIRST TIME THEY'D GO INTO COMBAT, THEY'D HAVE A MANGLED CORPSE THAT-- AN ARTILLERY CASUALTY-- BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH A BLANKET OVER HIM. AND AS THE NEW, GREEN REGIMENTS CAME ABREAST OF HIM, THEY'D WHISK THE BLANKET UP-- BLANKET OFF AND SAY, "THAT'S--TH|S IS WHAT'S WAITING FOR YOU UP AHEAD." NOT A--NOT A-- NOT A VERY PLEASANT STORY. CAN YOU TELL ME ALITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CONTRADICTIONS OF NEW YORK CITY'S SYMPATHIES, VERY, VERY BRIEFLY? UH, NEW YORK CITY CONTEMPLATED, AT LEAST CONTEMPLATED, ASECESSION FROM THE UNION, TOO, AND THEY WANTED TO BE DECLARED AN OPEN CITY. UH, THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF RESENTMENT OF THE INFLUX OF, UH, BLACKS AND IRISH AND GERMANS UH, COMING TO THE COUNTRY WHILE THE WAR WAS ON-- THE BACKWASH OF THE ARMIES, AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING-- AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY BEING MADE AND, UH, A LOT OF RESISTANCE TO THE DRAFT BECAUSE MEN COULD GET BETTER-PAYING JOBS THAN THEY'D EVER HAD, AND THE LAST THING THEY WANTED WAS TO GO TO THE WAR. THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF RESENTMENT, TOO, THAT IF YOU COULD SCRAPE UP $300, YOU COULD BE EXEMPT. AND ALL THOSE RESENTMENTS FLARED UP INTO WHAT'S CALLED THE NEW YORK DRAFT RIOTS IN LATE '64. MAN: MARCH 28, 1987. "AMERICAN DOCUMENTARIES." PROJECT TITLE: "CIVIL WAR." CAMERA ROLL 174, SOUND ROLL 32. INTERVIEW WITH SHELBY FOOTE. RECORDED FLAT, 7 1/2 IPS, -8 DB, REFERENCE TONE TO FOLLOW. THERE WAS A LOT OF FILM THROUGH THAT CAMERA WHEN WE CAME TO YOU... SOUND'S ROLLING. SPEED. CAMERA, PLEASE. ROLLING. SLATE? HOW WERE OFFICERS SELECTED IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY? CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THAT? ALL OFFICERS BELOW THE RANK OF BRIGADIER WERE ELECTED BY—-BY THE TROOPS. UH, YOU WOULD THINK FROM THAT THAT IT WOULD BE A POOR SYSTEM, BECAUSE MEN WOULD SELECT OFFICERS WHO WERE EASY ON THEM RATHER THAN WHO WERE SKILLFUL IN COMBAT. UH, YOU COULDN'T BE WRONGER. UH, MEN KNEW THAT THEY WERE ELECTING MEN WHOM THEY WERE WILLING TO TRUST WITH THEIR LIVES. SO YOU BETTER BELIEVE THEY SELECTED THE BEST MEN. IT WAS A SYSTEM THAT WORKED QUITE WELL. BULL RUN. JUST AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE, SET IT FOR ME. WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED? IT'S THIS SORT OF COMEDY OF ERRORS, THE WAY FIRST BATTLES NEARLY ALWAYS ARE IN WARS. SOUTH ERN ERS CALL IT MANASSAS; UH, FEDERALS CALL IT BULL RUN. UH, IT WAS JUST A MEETING ENGAGEMENT BY TWO ARMIES. THE SOUTH HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF WAITING FOR ATTACK, WHEREAS THE NORTHERN ARMIES HAD TO MAKE THE APPROACH MARCH WITH ALL ITS STRAGGLING AND EVERYTHING AND, UH, THEN THE SOUTH WAS REINFORCED BY TROOPS FROM THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY AND WON THE BATTLE. UH, MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT IT MEANT THE END OF THE WAR, IT HAD BEEN SUCH ADECISIVE DEFEAT. ACTUALLY, IT WOULDN'T HAVE COUNTED AS MUCH MORE THAN A FAIRLY HEAVY SKIRMISH LATER ON IN THE WAR. WILSON'S CREEK. WILSON'S CREEK IS THE-- MAN: EXCUSE ME. LET'S, UH, START AGAIN, PLEASE. OK, WILSON'S CREEK. WILSON'S CREEK IS A SORT OF WESTERN VERSION OF FIRST MANASSAS, UH, VERY MUCH SIMILAR, UH, |T...|T WAS AN ATTACK AND A REPULSE. UH, |T, TOO, WAS LOOKED ON AS A MAJOR BATTLE, BUT LATER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS A RATHER SMALL SKIRMISH. IT WAS A BLOODY THING, THOUGH. THEY STOOD THERE AND FIRED AWAY AT EACH OTHER. IT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM, UH, FROM FIRST MANASSAS. AND IT'S INTERESTING TO STUDY THE TWO BATTLES AS ONE BEING AN EASTERN-STYLE BATTLE AND THE OTHER AWESTERN-STYLE BATTLE. THE SIMILARITIES ARE GREATER THAN THE DIFFERENCES, THOUGH. ARE THERE, UH--|S THERE AWESTERN BATTLE THAT WE FORGET IN 1861 THAT WE SHOULDN'T, THAT'S IMPORTANT, IN '61? UH...THERE WEREN'T ANY BATTLES IN '61. UH, YOU KNOW, FIRST MANASSAS AND WILSON CREEK ARE ABOUT THE MAIN ONES, AND THEY ARE NOT MAJOR BATTLES. IT WAS JUST ALL LIKE ROLLING YOUR SLEEVES UP AND GETTING READY TO FIGHT. WHAT DID MARK TWAIN DO IN THE CIVIL WAR? HE SKEDADDLED. HEH! HE HAD A BRIEF PERIOD AS A RECRUIT, WHICH HE REWROTE, UH, MOSTLY OUT OF HIS IMAGINATION. UH...HE GOT OUT IS WHAT HE DID. WHAT ABOUT BOREDOM IN THE ARMY? THERE'S A LOT OF BOREDOM IN ALL ARMIES. UM, COMBAT IS AVERY SMALL PART OF ARMY SERVICE, IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN IT. 80 IT BECOMES...EVERYTH|NG ABOUT IT IS BORING. UH, THE FOOD IS BAD, THE TIME ON YOUR HANDS IS BAD, THE LACK OF READING MATERIALS IS BAD. UH, IT'S NEARLY ALL BOREDOM. UH, ALL ARMIES HAVE THAT THING THEY SAY: "HURRY UP AND WAIT." THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF THAT, AND--AND BOREDOM IS AVERY REAL FACTOR IN THE ARMY. WHAT WAS SCOTT-- WINFIELD SCOTT'S, I BELIEVE, COMMENT ON JEFFERSON DAVIS, ABOUT APOSTLES OR SOMETHING? THAT CAME OUT OF, UH, DAVIS BEFORE THE WAR, CHARGING SCOTT WITH HAVING OVERCHARGED HIS EXPENSES ON A TRIP SOMEWHERE OF $300. UH, AND SCOTT, UH, WAS FURIOUS AT THE QUESTIONING OF HIS, UH, EXPENSE ACCOUNT. HE SAID THAT, UH-- HE SAID OF DAVIS, UH... "I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED THE SAVIOR "FOR 30 PIECES OF SILVER, BUT FOR POLITICAL ADVANCEMENT, "HE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED THE SAVIOR, ALL THE APOSTLES, AND GOD ALMIGHTY HIMSELF," OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT. HE WAS REAL--REAL ANGRY AT DAVIS THEN BEING SECRETARY OF WAR. THERE'S AWONDERFUL SCENE IN WASHINGTON OF PEOPLE CROWDING IN AROUND LINCOLN AND SEEKING JOBS AND STUFF. CAN YOU SORT OF SET THAT WASHINGTON SCENE ALONG WITH THE TAPED STUFF? LINCOLN WAS TROUBLED BY OFFICE-SEEKERS THROUGHOUT HIS, UH-- HIS 4-PLUS YEARS IN OFFICE, BUT IT WAS WORSE AT THE START, WHERE HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGERS HAD PROMISED JOBS TO A GREAT MANY PEOPLE AND FAR MORE JOBS THAN, UH, THERE WERE, UH, FAR MORE APPLICANTS THAN THERE WERE JOBS. AND LINCOLN LOOKED PARTICULARLY WORRIED ONE DAY, AND SOMEBODY SAID, "WHAT'S THE MATTER, MR. PRESIDENT?" HE SAID, "THERE'S TOO MANY PIGS FOR THE TITS." OK. TELL ME ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE AT SHILOH. WHEN YOU DO A KIND OF, UH-- MAN: THAT AN AIRPLANE THERE? YEAH. OK. YEAH. I THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT. TOO LOUD? CUT. CUT. YEAH. SOUND'S ROLLING. SPEED. SLATE? HOLD, PLEASE. AND WAIT FOR ME AND... OK. CAN YOU TELL ME THAT STORY AGAIN ABOUT OFFICE-SEEKERS? UH, THROUGHOUT LINCOLN'S PRESIDENCY, AND THIS IS TRUE OF MOST PRESIDENTS, HE WAS FAIRLY RUN CRAZY BY OFFICE-SEEKERS, ESPECIALLY AT THE START, WHEN HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGERS HAD PROMISED JOBS TO A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHO CAME TO COLLECT THEM. AND ONE MAN SAW HIM ONE DAY, AND HE LOOKED PARTICULARLY WORRIED AND THE MAN SAID, "WHAT'S THE MATTER, MR. PRESIDENT?" AND LINCOLN SAID, "THERE'S TOO MANY PIGS FOR THE TITS." TELL ME ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE AT SHILOH. IT SEEMS TO BE AWHO'S WHO OF LATER EVENTS, AND FROM PRESIDENTS TO AUTHORS TO THINGS LIKE THAT. SHILOH'SA REAL, UH, GALLERY. UH, IT'S NO WONDER THAT SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE LATER PROMINENT WERE AT SHILOH. AND IT'S NO WONDER THAT PEOPLE NOWADAYS, ALMOST EVERYONE YOU MEET, SAID, "I HAD A GREAT-GREAT- GRANDFATHER AT SHILOH." THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, PRACTICALLY EVERY SOLDIER IN THE WESTERN THEATER WAS AT SHILOH. THEY BROUGHT THE TROOPS UP FROM NEW ORLEANS, FROM PENSACOLA, FROM ALMOST EVERYWHERE ELSE, TO MAKE THIS COUNTERATTACK AT CORINTH--FROM CORINTH. AND, UH, THAT IS WHY, UH, YOU SEE SO MANY PROMINENT MEN, UH, THERE. EVERYBODY WAS THERE. WHO ARE SOME OF THE NOTABLES FROM--UH, YOU-- THE LIST IS ENDLESS. UH, THEY--THEY WERE ALL THERE. HARDY, THE CORPS COMMANDERS AND THE DIVISION COMMANDERS, FORREST WAS THERE, JOHN HUNT MORGAN WAS THERE. THEY--THEY WERE ALL THERE. TELL ME ABOUT, UM, WHAT FORREST DID IN RETREAT AT SHILOH. WELL, THAT'S--THAT'S ONE OF THE INCREDIBLE STORIES. UH, AFTER THE BATTLE AT SHILOH, BRECKENRIDGE'S CORPS HELD THE REAR WHILE THE ARMY RETIRED. THEN BRECKENRIDGE FELL-- FADED BACK AND LEFT FORREST TO--TO--TO TAKE CARE OF, UH, HOLDING UP THE--THE PURSUIT. AND HE HAD A CONGLOMERATE COMMAND OF TEXANS, MISSISSIPPIANS, ARKANSANS, TENNESSEANS. UH, MORGAN'S MEN WERE IN THAT CROWD. ANYWAY, UH, THE RETREAT LAY THROUGH A--A SWALE WHERE, JUST BEFORE THE WAR, THERE HAD BEEN A LOGGING PROJECT, AND IT'S CALLED "FALLEN TIMBERS." THEY'D CUT THE TREES DOWN, BUT HAD NOT HAULED THEM OFF. SO FORREST GOT ON THE OTHER SIDE, ON A RIDGE THERE, LOOKING BACK. AND IT WAS SHERMAN IN COMMAND OF A BRIGADE THAT WAS FOLLOWING HIM. AND HE SAW THE BRIGADE START ACROSS THIS, UH, THIS "FALLEN TIMBERS" STRETCH, AND THEY WERE DISORGANIZED, AS IF ARTILLERY HAD OPENED ON THEM--SOME GOING AROUND THE LOGS AND STEPPING OVER THEM, EVERYTHING-- AND HE SAW THE DISORGANIZATION. AND INSTEAD OF WAITING TO DEFEND THE RIDGE, HE GAVE THE ORDER TO CHARGE, AND THEY CHARGED THEM. AND THEY WERE ALL DISORGANIZED AND FELL BACK AS FAST AS THEY COULD ON THE MAIN BODY. AND FORREST WAS PLUNGING AFTER HIM THE WAY HE DID, SWINGING THAT THING AROUND HIS HEAD, AND HOLLERING, "CHARGE! CHARGE!" AND HIS MEN SAW THAT THEY HAD REPULSED THESE DISORGANIZED MEN, SO THEY PULLED UP; FORREST KEPT GOING, AND HE LANDED SQUARE IN THE MAIN BODY OF THE UNION TROOPS. AND, UM, HE WAS SURROUNDED BY—- ONE GRAY UNIFORM IN A SEA OF BLUE. AND, UH, THEY BEGIN TO HOLLER, "KILL HIM! KILL THE GODDAMN REBEL! KNOCK HIM OFF HIS HORSE!" AND ONE SOLDIER DID, UH, STICK HIS, UH, RIFLE OUT INTO FORREST'S SIDE AND PULLED THE TRIGGER, AND LIFTED FORREST CLEAR OF THE SADDLE WITH THE IMPACT OF THE BULLET. AND FORREST, MEANTIME, WAS SLASHING WITH HIS SABER, HIS HORSE WAS KICKING AND TURNING. AND FORREST SAWED HIM AROUND AND GOT HIM CLEAR AND TOOK OFF, AND THEY WERE SHOOTING AFTER HIM, SO HE REACHED DOWN AND GRABBED ONE UNION SOLDIER AND SWUNG HIM UP BEHIND HIM ON THE CRUPPER OF THE HORSE TO USE AS A SHIELD. AND WHEN HE GOT OUT OF RANGE, HE THREW THE MAN OFF AND RODE BACK TO JOIN HIS COMMAND. THAT WAS THE LAST SHOT FIRED IN THE BATTLE OF SHILOH. WHY WAS THE DEATH OF ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON SO CRUCIAL? ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON WAS LOOKED ON BY MANY PEOPLE, AT THE TIME OF SHILOH-- AND ESPECIALLY BEFORE SHILOH, WHILE HE WAS HOLDING THAT LINE UP IN KENTUCKY-- AS THE SOUTH'S NUMBER-ONE FIELD SOLDIER. JEFFERSON DAVIS VIEWED HIM AS THAT, AND WHEN HE LOST TO ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON, HE SAID, "| REALIZED OUR STRONGEST PILLAR HAD BEEN BROKEN." UH, EVEN TODAY, IF YOU GO TO TEXAS, FOR EXAMPLE, IT'S ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON THAT'S REVERED AS MUCH AS ROBERT E. LEE. YOU USED THE PHRASE A LOT WITH ME "THE MOST MAN." WHAT DOES IT MEAN, AND WHO IS "THE MOST MAN?" THE BEST EXAMPLE I CAN GIVE YOU OF WHAT "THE MOST MAN" MEANS IS, IF YOU GO--WENT TO SEE MAN O'WAR, UH, UP UNTIL HE DIED IN '48, OR WHENEVER IT WAS, THE GROOM USED TO LEAD HIM OUT AND HE'D SAY, "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS THE MOST HORSE IN THE WORLD." AND |T—-|T'S JUST AN EXPRESSION THAT PASSED AROUND. WHO IS THE MOST MAN IN THE CIVIL WAR, SHELBY? |--| GUESS ROBERT E. LEE AND U.S. GRANT, BUT UNQUESTIONABLY, THE MOST MAN IS ABRAHAM LINCOLN. CAN YOU GIVE ME AN AERIAL VIEW OF SHILOH? WHAT'S HAPPENING, JUST IN A SENTENCE OR TWO? THE--THE THING ABOUT SHILOH THAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THERE IS NO VIEW. UH, IT WAS FOUGHT IN EARLY APRIL. THE TREES WERE LEAFED OUT, AND THE ROADS WERE MEANDERING COW PATHS. NOBODY KNEW NORTH FROM SOUTH, EAST FROM WEST. THEY'D NEVER BEEN IN COMBAT BEFORE, MOST OF THEM, ESPECIALLY ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE. 80 IT WAS JUST A DISORGANIZED, MURDEROUS FISTFIGHT OF 100,000 MEN SLAMMING AWAY AT EACH OTHER AND NOBODY ABLE, REALLY, TO EXERT ANY DIRECTION. UH, IT WAS JUST TWO ARMED MOBS, UH, IN A MURDEROUS THING. YOU MUST REALIZE, OUT OF THESE 100,000 MEN, OVER 20,000 OF THEM WERE KILLED, WOUNDED, OR CAPTURED, OR MISSING. UH, |T--|T WAS SLAUGHTER ON A LARGE SCALE AS A RESULT OF THIS DISORGANIZATION. TELL ME ABOUT BRICE'S CROSSROADS. BRICE'S CROSSROADS IS A BRIGHT CAMEO OF ACTION. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL INSTANCE OF HOW ONE MAN CAN DETERMINE AN OUTCOME OF A BATTLE; IT'S BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED. AND FOR ONCE, WE'VE GOT FORREST QUOTES TELLING EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. AND IT DID, JUST THE WAY HE SAID IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. HE GAVE WONDERFUL ORDERS IN THAT. HE SAID, UH, "TELL BELL TO COME UP FAST AND FETCH ALL HE'S GOT." HE SAID THINGS LIKE, "HIT THEM ON THE END." UM, IT'S A DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT FORREST SAID WHEN HE-- WHAT HE MEANT WHEN HE SAID, UH, "I'D RATHER HAVE 5 MINUTES OF BULGE THAN A WEEK OF TACTICS." IT, UH--BR|CE'S CROSSROADS WAS HIS CHANCE TO SHOW TRUE BRILLIANCE AS A GENERAL IN COMMAND OF A FIELD OF BATTLE. IT'LL REPAY ANY AMOUNT OF STUDY. CUT, PLEASE. THAT WAS A ROLL OUT. TIME. SO, ACTUALLY, ON THE FIRST QUESTION IS... MARCH 28, 1987. "AMERICAN DOCUMENTARIES." PROJECT TITLE: "CIVIL WAR." CAMERA ROLL 175, SOUND ROLL 33. INTERVIEW WITH SHELBY FOOTE. RECORDED FLAT, 7 1/2 IPS, -8 DB, REFERENCE TONE TO FOLLOW. ROLLING. SPEED. AND...SLATE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH MCCLELLAN? WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM? MCCLELLAN, UH, IS AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF A MAN WHO WAS NOT ALL THAT GOOD ON AN ACTUAL FIELD OF FIGHT. HIS SPECIALTY, LIKE BRAGG IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY, IS PREPARING TROOPS TO FIGHT, AND HE DID THAT SUPERBLY. MCCLELLAN HAS ANOTHER, UH, CHARACTERISTIC, WHICH IS, HE'S PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR OF ALL THE UNION GENERALS WITH THE TROOPS THEMSELVES. THEY LOVED MCCLELLAN AND WERE ALWAYS WILLING TO STOP TO CHEER HIM AT EVERY POINT. THEY VERY SELDOM CHEERED GRANT; IT WASN'T THAT THEY DIDN'T LIKE HIM AND ADMIRE HIM, BUT MCCLELLAN AROUSED ENTHUSIASM. MCCLELLAN TRAINED THAT ARMY. WHATEVER THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC DID IN THE AFTER YEARS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE TRAINING MCCLELLAN GAVE THEM IN THAT FIRST YEAR. BUT HIS LETTERS HOME TO HIS WIFE ARE RIDICULOUS. HE'S A LITTLE NAPOLEON. HE SEES HIMSELF IN NAPOLEONIC HUES, UH, AND IT DETRACTS FROM HIM. HE'S THOUGHT OF AS BEING SHORT LIKE NAPOLEON. ACTUALLY, MCCLELLAN WAS ABOUT 5'6" OR 7", WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH AVERAGE HEIGHT FOR A MAN IN THOSE DAYS. WHAT DID MEN EAT? IT DEPENDED ON WHICH ARMY YOU WERE IN. UH, IN THE SOUTHERN ARMY, YOU ATE SOMETHING CALLED "SLOOSH." YOU GOT ISSUED CORNMEAL AND BACON, AND YOU FRIED THE BACON, WHICH LEFTA GREAT DEAL OF GREASE IN THE PAN. THEN YOU TOOK THE CORNMEAL AND SWIRLED IT AROUND IN THE GREASE TO MAKE THE DOUGH. AND THEN YOU MIGHT TAKE THE DOUGH AND ROUND-- UH, MAKE A SNAKE OF IT AND PUT IT AROUND YOUR RAMROD AND COOK IT OVER THE-- OVER THE CAMPFIRE. THAT WAS CALLED "SLOOSH." THEY ATE A LOT OF THAT. WHAT DID LINCOLN THINK OF POPE? AND TELL ME-- ASSESS POPE. POPE IS, UH, DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WITH ANY CHARITY BECAUSE HE'S A BLOWHARD GENERAL WHO CAME TO WOES AND WAS SHIPPED OUT TO MINNESOTA TO GET RID OF HIM. UH, LINCOLN WAS WARNED AT THE START, UH, THAT POPE WAS NOT TO BE TRUSTED WITH TELLING THE TRUTH, THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE TRUSTED IN VARIOUS OTHER WAYS. AND LINCOLN SAID, "I'VE KNOWN THE POPES "BACK IN ILLINOIS, KNOWN ALL OF THEM. "THEY'RE ALL LIARS AND BRAGGARTS, "BUT I DON'T KNOW OF ANY PARTICULAR REASON WHY A LIAR AND A BRAGGART SHOULDN'T MAKE A GOOD GENERAL." ISN'T THERE SOMETHING ABOUT HIS HEAD-- HEADQUARTERS OR WHERE HIS... THAT'S AN OLD ARMY JOKE. UM, HE HEADED HIS DISPATCH, UH, HEADQUARTERS IN THE SADDLE. AND THE JOKE--|T'S AN OLD ARMY JOKE, THAT HE HAD HIS HEADQUARTERS WHERE HIS HINDQUARTERS OUGHT TO BE. TELL ME ABOUT JACKSON AT, UH, SHARPSBURG WITH THE PEACH. I MEAN, IT'S ACHILLING SCENE. JACKSON, UH, IS AN EERIE CHARACTER, UM, THE OLD TESTAMENT WARRIOR WHO BELIEVED IN SMITING THEM HIP AND THIGH. AFTER THE BLOODY FIGHTING AT SHARPSBURG, PARTICULARLY IN THE CORN FIELD, AND AROUND THE DUNKER CHURCH, AFTER HIS PART OF THE BATTLE WAS OVER, UH, JACKSON WAS SITTING ON HIS HORSE EATING A PEACH, AND HIS, UH, MEDICAL DIRECTOR, DR. MCGUIRE, WAS THERE. AND, UH... HE--HE LOOKED OUT OVER THIS FIELD, WHERE THERE WERE DEAD OF BOTH SIDES LITTERED ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND AS HE'S EATING THE PEACH, HE SAID, "GOD HAS BEEN VERY KIND TO US THIS DAY." WHAT DID A.P. HILL DO? I MEAN, HE'S GOT THIS MARVELOUS MOMENT THERE AT THE END OF THE DAY. A.P. HILL IS THE-- IS THE FIGHTINGEST DIVISION COMMANDER IN LEE'S ARMY. AND, UH, THE LINE "AND THEN A.P. HILL CAME UP" IS THE LINE FROM SHARPSBURG, WHERE HILL ARRIVED AT ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE NICK-OF-THE-MOMENT THINGS. AND, UH, IT WAS THE LAST ONE, AND IT SUCCEEDED |N THROWING BURNSIDE BACK AFTER HE FINALLY GOT ACROSS THE BRIDGE. ANY ONE OF THEM WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF THE BATTLE, BUT IT WAS A CLIMATIC ONE AFTER EVERYBODY THOUGHT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY GET THERE IN TIME FROM HARPER'S FERRY. HE DID GET THERE IN TIME AND DID THROW BURNSIDE BACK. CHANGING SCENES NOW ALITTLE BIT. IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT VALVERDE, NEW MEXICO? CAN YOU PAINT THAT SCENE? IS THAT AN INTERESTING BATTLE? |-|T'S A--|T'S AVERY WEIRD THING. IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SEPARATE CAMPAIGN THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED 50 YEARS BEFORE OR 50 YEARS AFTER. THE DESERT FIGHTING IS VERY STRANGE. THE MEN WERE FIGHTING AS MUCH AGAINST THE DESERT AS THEY WERE AGAINST TROOPS. IT WAS HARD TO STAY ALIVE FOR A WHOLE DAY WITHOUT WATER IN THAT COUNTRY, SO THAT IT BECAME AVERY DIFFERENT KIND OF FIGHTING FROM THE REST OF THE-- REST OF THE WAR. I HEARD THAT ORDER 191, SKIPPING BACK TO SHARPSBURG AGAIN, HAS BEEN CALLED-- MCCLELLAN'S INACTION ON IT HAS BEEN CALLED THE GREAT CRIME OF THE WAR. WHAT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF IGNORING IT? |--|--| DON'T THINK THAT THE CONDITIONS THAT ALLOWED MCCLELLAN TO SEE THROUGH LEE'S PLAN-- ONCE HE HAD ACTED ON THEM AND GOT THEM ON THE SOUTH MOUNTAIN AND THEN ON THE FIELD AT SHARPSBURG, ANY INFORMATION HE HAD WAS OF NO HELP TO HIM BY THEN. WHAT ABOUT THAT SAME YEAR, JACKSON AND THE PENINSULAR CAMPAIGN AND--NOT IN THE PENINSULA CAMPAIGN. THE 7 DAYS? THE 7 DAYS. WHAT'S HE DOING? WELL, UH, THERE HAVE BEEN, UH, SOME INTERESTING MEDICAL STUDY OF JACKSON IN THE 7 DAYS, AND IT'S FOUND THAT HE HAD ABOUT 5 HOURS' SLEEP IN THE PAST 3 DAYS. SO THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON WHAT LACK OF SLEEP WILL DO TO A MAN. AT THE TIME, THEY WERE GREATLY PUZZLED BY IT AND THERE WERE THINGS LIKE "THE HOODED FALCON CANNOT STRIKE." UH, IN OTHER WORDS, JACKSON OPERATES FINE IN AN INDEPENDENT COMMAND, BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO FUNCTION AS PART OF AN ARMY. WE LATER FOUND OUT HOW UNTRUE THAT IS. WHAT HE WAS WAS AVICTIM OF A PARTICULAR KIND OF FATIGUE. HE WAS A LONG WAY FROM HIS BEST IN THE 7 DAYS. '62 REALLY SEES A BURGEONING TECHNOLOGY. THE WAR REALLY SPAWNS A LOT OF STUFF, CLAUDE MINIE AND OTHER THINGS. CAN YOU TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT INVENTIONS AND THE ARTS OF DEATH HERE? THERE WERE MANY INVENTIONS, BUT PERHAPS, UH, THE ONE THING THAT THE WAR CONTRIBUTED, REALLY, TO THE ART OF WARFARE WAS FIELD FORTIFICATIONS. UH, THAT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LONGSTREET, WHOSE MEN INVENTED IT, AND JACKSON SAW IT AND EMULATED IT. LEE USED IT. FINALLY, THAT ARMY GOT SO THEY COULD FLOW INTO A POSITION THE WAY WATER SEEKS ITS OWN LEVEL. THEY COULD, UH, GET INTOA POSITION AND HAVE OVERLAPPING FIELDS OF FIRE THAT A MASTER MIGHT HAVE DESIGNED. THE MEN DID IT THEMSELVES, AFTER THE EXPERIENCE OF FIGHTING THAT THEY HAD. DID THE UNION BLOCKADE-- WAS IT EFFECTIVE? IT WAS QUITE EFFECTIVE. UM, IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT. THERE WERE ALWAYS THINGS GETTING THROUGH, AS LONG AS THERE WERE BLOCKADE PORTS, BUT IT GOT HARDER AND HARDER TO GET THEM THROUGH. ORIGINALLY, THERE WERE 4 OUT OF 5 GETTING THROUGH AND FINALLY WOUND UP 1 OUT OF 3. BUT THEY ALWAYS WOULD MANAGE TO--ABLE TO GET THROUGH, PARTICULARLY AT WILMINGTON... THE LAST TO FALL. DID MEN DRINK IN THE ARMY? THEY DRANK WHEN THEY COULD. UH, IT WAS VERY HARD TO FIND, UH, LIQUOR, UH, IN THE SOUTH. FOR ONE REASON, MANY OF THE STILLS HAD BEEN, UH, DISMANTLED AND THE COPPER USED TO MAKE PERCUSSION CAPS OUT OF. BUT THEY DRANK WHATEVER THEY COULD GET THEIR HANDS ON. IF I WAS IN THE ARMY, I'D HEAR A NATION OF MANY ACCENTS. WHAT WOULD | HEAR, ESPECIALLY IN, LET'S SAY, THE SOUTHERN ARMY? WELL, IT'D DEPEND ON HOW SHARP YOUR EAR WAS. UH, YOU--SOUTH CAROLINIANS DON'T TALK THE WAY LOUISIANIANS DO, SO YOU'D GET SOME OF THAT. BUT I THINK THEY'D PROBABLY BE MORE ALIKE THEN THAN THEY ARE NOW, UH, EVEN THOUGH TELEVISION HAS HOMOGENIZED OUR LANGUAGE. I THINK, UH, THAT YOU-- YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD VERY FEW FOREIGN ACCENTS, FOR INSTANCE, IN THE SOUTHERN ARMY; SOME, BUT NOT MANY. UH, AND IT'S HARD TO SAY NOW. WE'RE A LONG WAY REMOVED FROM IT. YEAH. TELL ME ABOUT LINCOLN, WHAT HE SAID ABOUT KENTUCKY, ABOUT GOD AND KENTUCKY. UH,AT THE TIME, HE WAS BEING URGED TO TAKE STRONG POLITICAL ACTION TO HOLD KENTUCKY IN THE UNION. LINCOLN WAS VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT MOVING INTO KENTUCKY, LEST HE SCARE THEM OUT. AND HE SAID--UH, HIS SUMMATION WAS, "I HOPE I HAVE GOD ON MY SIDE, BUT I MUST HAVE KENTUCKY." WHAT'S THE STORY ABOUT CHURCH BELLS DURING THE PENINSULAR CAMPAIGN, RINGING AND TOLLING? FROM MCCLELLAN'S LINES, YOU COULD HEAR THE BELLS OF RICHMOND TOLLING. YOU COULD HEAR THE CHURCH BELLS AND THE PUBLIC CLOCKS STRIKING. HE WAS THAT CLOSE. WOW. TELL ME ABOUT LINCOLN'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH IN '62. IT'S REALLY A FANTASTIC-- IT'S WHERE WHAT I CALL A"L|NCOLN MUSIC" FIRST BEGAN TO SOUND. UH, |T--|T IS A STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IN WHICH HE REFERRED TO THE UNION AND OUR FORM OF GOVERNMENT BEING THE-- THE "LAST BEST HOPE OF EARTH." IT'S TRULYA NOBLE SPEECH, UH, AND IT, UH, IT RANKS WITH SOME OF THE BEST AMERICAN WRITING EVER DONE, AT THAT TIME OR SINCE. WHAT'S THE "McCLELLAN/CUSTER FORDING THE STREAM STORY"? UH, DURING THE PENINSULA CAMPAIGN, UH, MCCLELLAN WAS WORKING HIS WAY UP THE YORK-JAMES PENINSULA AND HE CAME TO A STREAM, AND HE AND HIS STAFF WERE SITTING THERE, WONDERING HOW DEEP IT WAS IF THEY HAD TO MARCH ACROSS IT. AND, UH, CUSTER, WHO WAS AJUNIOR OFFICER ON HIS STAFF-- JUST GRADUATED FROM WEST POINT; ACAPTAIN, |TH|NK-- RODE OUT INTO MIDSTREAM, SAT HIS HORSE, AND TURNED AROUND IN THE SADDLE AND SAID TO MCCLELLAN, "THIS IS HOW DEEP IT IS, GENERAL." WHAT DID THE NORTH FEAR? THERE'S A GREAT SCENE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE FEAR FROM THE, UH, IRONCLAD SHIP. UH,AT THE TIME, UH, THE MERRIMACK CAME OUT AND SANK THOSE WOODEN SHIPS, UH, THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF FEAR IN WASHINGTON THAT THEY WERE GONNA COME OUT AROUND THE CAPES AND COME UP THE POTOMAC, UH, UP CHESAPEAKE BAY AND THE POTOMAC. AND, UH, STANTON, STANDING, LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE CABINET MEETING, SAID, "SHE MAY APPEAR AT ANY MOMENT AND FIRE SOME SHOTS RIGHT INTO THIS ROOM." WELLES, THE SECRETARY OF NAVY, HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CONTEMPT FOR STANTON ANYHOW AND SAID IT WAS RIDICULOUS, AND IT WAS. UH, THE MERRIMACK COULD NOT HAVE MADE SUCH ATRIP. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT BEN BUTLER ON HORSEBACK AND THE WILMINGTON STORY? THEY SAID HE WAS THE MOST RIDICULOUS FIGURE ON HORSEBACK. HE LOOKED LIKE SOMEBODY OF ODDLY ASSORTED PARTS PUT TOGETHER AND ALL JIGGLING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WHEN HE RODE. AND HE WAS COCKEYED, WHICH ADDED TO THE IMPRESSION. BUTLER--BUTLER IS AN ATTRACTIVE FIGURE IN A LOT OF WAYS, UH, HIS ECCENTRICITIES BEING ONE--UH, PART OF IT. PERRYVILLE, KENTUCKY-- IMPORTANT? YES, IT'S AN INTERESTING BATTLE, UM, WHICH YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE 9,000 OR 10,000 CONFEDERATES, UH, MATCHED AGAINST 40,000 OR 50,000 UNION TROOPS. BUT 2/3 OF THE UNION TROOPS WEREN'T ENGAGED, AND IT WAS A RATHER BRIEF BUT BLOODY BATTLE, UH, THAT AS SOON AS NIGHTFALL FELL, THE CONFEDERATES FOUND OUT WHAT THEY WERE FACING AND GOT THE HELL OUT. UH, IT'S AN IMPORTANT BATTLE, THOUGH. IT'S THE LAST BATTLE OF BRAGG'S INVASION AND, UH, AN INTERESTING BATTLE. IT'S WHERE SHERIDAN FIRST MADE A SHOWING. UH, PAT CLEBURNE WAS BADLY WOUNDED AT PERRYVILLE. PERRYVILLE IS AN INTERESTING BATTLE. | FIRST SAW THE FIELD OF PERRYVILLE-- I'D JUST BLUNDERED INTO IT, AND APPARENTLY NOBODY KNEW IT WAS THERE. IT WAS A TOTALLY DESERTED PLACE. | BET IT'S BEEN DEVELOPED SINCE THEN. THIS WAS WAY BACK IN THE LATE FIFTIES. CUT, PLEASE. ROLL OUT. PERFECT. WE HAVE CAUGHT UP WITH OURSELVES. I HAVE ONE OTHER '62 QUESTION, AND THEN I'M MOVING INTO-- AUDIO DROPOUT GOOD LUCK. MAN: MARCH 28, 1987. "AMERICAN DOCUMENTARIES." PROJECT TITLE: "CIVIL WAR." CAMERA ROLL 176, SOUND ROLL 34. INTERVIEW WITH SHELBY FOOTE. RECORDED FLAT, 7 1/2 IPS, -8 DB, REFERENCE TONE TO FOLLOW. ROLLING, SPEED. AND...DARN. SORRY. MOMENT. JUST KEEP ROLLING SOUND. MOVE YOUR HAND AWAY FOR A SECOND, KEN. | COULDN'T FOCUS. OK. AND...SLATE. SHELBY, ONE OF MY FAVORITE STORIES |S THE TULLAHOMA JOKE. YEAH. CAN YOU TELL ME THE TULLAHOMA JOKE? WELL, BRAGG'S ARMY WAS, UH, IN CAMP IN THE WINTER. UH, AND TULLA—-TULLAHOMA WAS A--THE HEADQUARTERS. AND SOME CONFEDERATE STAFF MEMBER SAID THAT, UH, TULLAHOMA WAS NOT AN INDIAN NAME AS COMMONLY SUPPOSED. IT'S FROM THE GREEK, "TULLA," MEANING "MUD," AND "HOMA," MEANING "MORE MUD." WHEN THE MEN WERE ON R&R--TALK; ABOUT R&R;, AND TELL ME WHAT ATRIP TO THAT WHOREHOUSE WAS CALLED, AND PART OF THAT STORY. UH, ATRIP TO THE WHOREHOUSE WAS CALLED "A TRIP DOWN THE LINE." UH, THERE WERE MANY OTHER TERMS FOR IT, TOO, AND THERE WERE A GREAT MANY PROSTITUTES ON BOTH SIDES, UH, PRINCIPALLY IN THE CITIES WHERE THE BOYS WENT ON FURLOUGH, LIKE RICHMOND OR NEW YORK OR WHEREVER. BUT THEY--THEY WERE-- THEY WERE VERY ACTIVE. INCIDENTALLY, IT'S NOT TRUE THAT HOOKERS GOT THEIR NAME FROM HOOKER. UH, UH, THEY WERE "HOOKERS" BEFORE HOOKER. DID MEN FIGHT IN THE SNOW? WERE THERE BATTLES IN THE SNOW? THEY HAD A--A—-A-- OF COURSE, THERE WAS SOME FIGHTING IN THE SNOW AT FREDERICKSBURG. BUT THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT THE SNOW IS THEY USED TO HAVE, UH, SNOWBALL BATTLES. AND THEY WOULD FIGHT BY REGIMENTS AND BRIGADES, AND MANEUVER AND THROW SNOWBALLS. AND, UH, THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME VILLAINOUS CHARACTER WHO'D PUTA ROCK IN HIS SNOWBALL, AND SOMEBODY WOULD LOSE AN EYE OR SO. BUT THEY HAD VERY REAL BATTLES, SORT OF TRAINING. THEY'D MATCH THE 53rd VIRGINIA AGAINST THE 23rd GEORGIA AND HAVE IT OUT WITH SNOWBALLS. TELL ME ABOUT THE VALLEY FORGE OF FREDERICKSBURG, OF AFTER FREDERICKSBURG. HE--THE WORST, UH, VALLEY FORGE THING-- NOBODY WAS BAREFOOT IN IT, BUT BURNSIDE'S MUD MARCH AFTER FREDERICKSBURG WAS A REAL NIGHTMARE. THEY JUST HAD TO CALL IT OFF WHEN EVERYTHING WAS TOTALLY STALLED. UH, THEY--THEY—-THE WORST SUFFERING THAT I KNOW OF WAS IN THE RETREAT FROM NASHVILLE. UH, THE ARMY RETREATED, UH, MANY OF THEM WERE BAREFOOT. IT WAS, UH, VERY BAD WEATHER, COLD, WINTERTIME, AND, UH, BRAGG, DOING ANOTHER OF HIS RETREATS. FORREST, UH, ORGANIZED ATHING WITH WAGONS, UH, RUNNING, UH, RELAYS OF WAGONS BACK AND FORTH WITH THE MEN PILING INTO THEM AND RIDING A CERTAIN DISTANCE DOWN THE ROAD, AND THEN THE WAGON WOULD GO BACK AND PICK UP SOME MORE. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE VALOR OF THE UNION MEN AT FREDERICKSBURG? VALOR IS USUALLY--UH, MORE CREDIT FOR VALOR IS GIVEN TO CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE HAD MORE ELAN AND DASH. UH, ACTUALLY, I KNOW OF NO BRAVER MEN IN EITHER ARMY THAN THE UNION TROOPS AT FREDERICKSBURG, WHICH WAS A SERIOUS DEFEAT. BUT TO KEEP CHARGING THAT WALL AT THE FOOT OF MARYE'S HEIGHTS AFTER ALL THE FAILURES THEY'D BEEN, AND THEY WERE ALL FAILURES, UH, IS A SINGULAR INSTANCE OF VALOR. UH, IT WAS A—-D|FFERENT FROM SOUTHERN ELAN. IT WAS A STEADINESS UNDER FIRE, A CONTINUING TO PRESS THE--THE POINT. WHAT'S THE NORTHERN LIGHTS STORY AT FREDERICKSBURG? AFTER THE BATTLE, UH, THAT NIGHT, UH, IT WAS VERY UNUSUAL TO SEE THE NORTHERN LIGHTS THAT FAR SOUTH. BUT THE WHOLE HEAVENS WERE LIT UP WITH STREAMERS OF FIRE AND WHATEVER THE NORTHERN LIGHTS ARE. AND, UH, THE CONFEDERATES TOOK IT AS A SIGN THAT GOD ALMIGHTY HIMSELF WAS CELEBRATING A CONFEDERATE VICTORY. WHAT DID THEY CALL IT? DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, THEY SORT OF SAID SOMETHING ABOUT "HANGING OUT THE BANNERS" OR SOMETHING? YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, HEAVEN WAS HANGING OUT THE BANNERS, THE STREAMERS. UH, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS BEFORE, BUT, UH, WHY WERE THERE SO MANY, UH, MISSING AT FREDERICKSBURG? AND SORT OF SET IT UP. THE--THE--THE FIGURES I HAVE FORGOTTEN, EXACTLY. LEE LOST A GOOD DEAL, LESS THAN HALF AS MANY MEN AS BURNSIDE, AND, UH, IT'S KIND OF SUSPICIOUS THAT THEY SHOULD BE MISSING FROM THE CONFEDERATE-- ON THE CONFEDERATE LIST, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT CHARGING. THEY WERE IN POSITION. AND, UH--AHEM--THEY NOW BELIEVE THAT A GOOD MANY OF THE MISSING HAD GONE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS. CAN YOU MAKE LINCOLN A HUMAN BEING? CAN YOU PAINT-- YOU TALKED TO ME ONCE ABOUT AN ALMOST EFFEMINATE QUALITY HE HAD, BUT MAKE HIM HUMAN FOR ME. IT'S VERY HARD TO GET HOLD OF LINCOLN. HE'S BEEN EMBALMED IN LEGEND. AND, UH, ALL THE STORIES OF HIS COMPASSION-- WHICH ARE GREATLY OVERDONE, UH, AS YOU KNOW, FROM CERTAIN THINGS, LIKE HANGING 31 INDIANS IN ONE DAY AT MANKATO. UH, WHAT'S SO INTERESTING ABOUT LINCOLN IS THE MANY SIDES OF HIS CHARACTER, AND WHAT LEGEND HAS DONE IS TAKEN WHAT IT THOUGHT WAS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE SIDES OF HIM AND--AND MADE A LINCOLN WHO HAD ONLY THOSE SIDES. THE OTHER SIDES OF LINCOLN, PARTICULARLY THE PRACTICAL POLITICIAN, UH, UH... GET NEGLECTED WHEN THEY-- WHEN THEY, UH, ERECT HIM. HE HASN'T BECOME A MARBLE MAN, AS THEY SAY OF LEE NOWADAYS, BUT HE'S COMING PRETTY CLOSE TO BEING, UH, SMOTHERED IN, UH, IN SENTIMENTALITY. LINCOLN WAS ONE OF THE LEAST SENTIMENTAL MEN WHO EVER LIVED. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT "SOFT, EFFEMINATE SIDE," YOU CALLED IT? |T'S--|T--|T'S-- IT'S HARD TO KNOW, UH, UH, UH, WHAT TO CALL IT. |T'S--|T'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE, UH, RUGGED, UH, SORT OF MOUNTAIN TYPE THAT THEY SEE LINCOLN AS. THERE'S THIS--THERE'S A SOFTNESS TO HIM AND A COMPASSION IN HIM AND A FEELING FOR SUFFERING THAT HAS, SOME THOUGHT, THE QUALITY OF, UH, NOT EFFEMINATE, BYA LONG SHOT, BUT FEMININE. WHAT WAS JANUARY 1, 1863 LIKE FOR LINCOLN? WHAT'S THE SCENE? THAT WAS ONE OF THE BUSIEST DAYS OF HIS LIFE. HE SIGNED THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, HE HAD A RECEPTION THAT MORNING, UH, GOD KNOWS HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HE HAD TO SHAKE HANDS WITH. WHEN IT GOT TIME TO SIGN THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, AND HIS, UH, HAND WAS, UH, NOT IN GOOD SHAPE AFTER ALL THAT HAND-SHAKING, AND HE WAS AFRAID THAT IT WAS GONNA LOOK LIKE HE HAD HESITATED IN SIGNING IT. SO HE SAT DOWN AND WROTE IT, AND EVERYBODY WATCHED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF ANXIETY. AND HE VERY SELDOM SIGNED A DOCUMENT "ABRAHAM LINCOLN." HE USUALLY SIGNED, "A. LINCOLN." THIS TIME, HE WROTE OUT THE "ABRAHAM" AND WHEN HE GOT THROUGH, EVERYBODY HEAVED A BIG SIGH OF RELIEF BECAUSE HE HAD WRITTEN IT IN A GOOD, BOLD HAND. UM, I WANT TO CUT FOR A SECOND WHILE THAT PLANE GOES. SOUND'S ROLLING. SPEED. WAIT. SLATE. SHELBY, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THEORIES OF HISTORY AND YOU SAID SOMETHING |N-- REFERRING IN GENERAL TO THE CIVIL WAR ABOUT "CLEAR RIVERS AND A BLOODY LAKE." THAT'S A DOUGLAS SOUTHALL FREEMAN, UH, QUOTE. HE WROTE ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR FOR YEARS. UH, "R.E. LEE," "LEE'S LIEUTENANTS." AHEM. AND THEN HE BEGAN A BIOGRAPHY OF GEORGE WASHINGTON. AND HE SAID HE WAS AMAZED AT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH THE THING TOOK PLACE. UH, FOR INSTANCE, THERE WAS AN ABSENCE OF RELIGION, OR FORMAL RELIGION, ANYHOW, A LOT OF FREE THINKING AND SO FORTH, SO DIFFERENT FROM THE CIVIL WAR ATMOSPHERE THAT HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT AMERICAN HISTORY WAS A CLEAR STREAM RUNNING INTO A BLOODY LAKE-- THE CIVIL WAR--AND COMING OUT CLEAR ON THE OTHER SIDE. HE FELT THAT THE MEN OF HIS TIME-- THAT IS, THE MID-20th CENTURY-- WERE MORE LIKE THE REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE THAN THEY WERE LIKE THE CIVIL WAR PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHY HE REFERRED TO THE CIVIL WAR AS A SORT OF BLOODY LAKE INTO WHICH THE CLEAR STREAM OF AMERICAN HISTORY RAN AND EMERGED. WHAT WAS L|KE--L|FE ON A GUNBOAT LIKE? MAN: PAUSE. PAUSE. THERE'S A--THERE'S AWONDERFUL QUOTE, UH-- TRY IT AGAIN, PLEASE. OK. THERE'S A QUOTE ABOUT WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE ON A GUNBOAT. | WISH I COULD REMEMBER IT. |T—- SAID, "IF YOU WANT TO KNOW"-- HE'S WRITING HOME TO HIS MOTHER AND TELLING HER WHAT IT'S LIKE. HE SAID, "IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE, GO DOWN "IN THE BASEMENT WHERE THERE ARE A GREAT MANY RUSTY THINGS "LYING AROUND, THEN GO UP ON THE ROOF WHERE THE SUN'S HOT "FORAWHILE, AND, UH, EAT SOME BAD FOOD "AND LISTEN TO DIRTY TALK BY OTHER SAILORS, AND YOU'LL HAVE SOME KIND OF NOTION WHAT MY LIFE IS LIKE." THERE WAS WHERE BOREDOM CAME IN. UH, LIFE ON THE GUNBOATS WAS AVERY BORING THING, ESPECIALLY ON BLOCKADE DUTY. BRANDY STATION. BRANDY STATION IS A FAMOUS CAVALRY BATTLE. AND IT WAS WHERE J.E.B. STUART GOT TAKEN DOWN A NOTCH. AND IT MAY HAVE HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO WITH HIS BEHAVIOR ON THE GETTYSBURG-- IN THE GETTYSBURG CAMPAIGN, TRYING TO RETRIEVE HIS REPUTATION; NOT THAT HE LOST AT BRANDY STATION, BUT HE GOT, UH-- GOT CHECKED. IT'S A PRETTY SPECTACULAR BATTLE, THOUGH. IT IS, INDEED. IT'S A--A... VON BORCKE'S BOOK CALLED, "DIE GROSSE REITERSCHLACHT BEI BRANDY STATION" HAS ALWAYS BEEN A WONDERFUL TITLE TO ME. TELL ME ABOUT WHAT ROBERT E. LEE'S CONVERSATION WITH J.E.B. STUART WENT LIKE AFTER HE FINALLY SHOWED UP TO GETTYSBURG. WELL, STUART HAD BEEN MISSING FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS. HE GOT THERE ON THE-- LATE IN THE SECOND DAY. AND, UH, STUART WAS A... HE WAS--HE KNEW THAT HE HAD DONE WRONG BEING AWAY AND HE DID AGREAT DEAL MORE WRONG THAN HE KNEW. LEE WAS GROPING AROUND BLIND IN PENNSYLVANIA BECAUSE OF STUART'S—- SO WHEN STUART ARRIVED--AHEM-- ALL HE HAD TO SHOW FOR ALL THIS WAS A COUPLE OF HUNDRED WAGONS AND MULES AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AND HE--HE SAW LEE STANDING THERE, STERNLY LOOKING AT HIM ARRIVING LATE. AND HE--HE BLEW THE THING BY MAKING HIS ANNOUNCEMENT AT THE START, AND HE SAID, "GENERAL, I'VE BROUGHT YOU 200 BRAND-NEW WAGONS," AND LEE SAID, "GENERAL, THEY'RE AN IMPEDIMENT TO ME NOW. IASKED YOU TO HELP ME WHIP THESE PEOPLE." AND, UH, IT WAS A... ASEVERE ADMONISHMENT FROM LEE. AND, UH, LEE SAW HE'D HURT HIS FEELINGS, SO HE SAID, "COME, IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT. WE'LL, UH--WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT." WHAT DID THE CONFEDERATE SOLDIER OR OFFICER SAY WHEN HE ARRIVED INTO THE BEAUTY OF THE PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRYSIDE AND LOOKED AROUND? OR SET THE SCENE FOR ME. WELL, THE CONFEDERATES ARE INVADING, UH, THE NORTH. THEY MARCH THROUGH MARYLAND AND ON INTO PENNSYLVANIA, AND IT'S, UH, VERY HANDSOME COUNTRY THERE. THE BARNS ARE MAGNIFICENT, AND THE GREEN FIELDS AND EVERYTHING, AND THE PEOPLE, UH, WATCHING THESE CONFEDERATES GO BY. AND THERE WAS A BLACK BODY SERVANT, UH, UH, IN THE COLUMN, AND THEY STOPPED, UH, JUST A HALT, AND THE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THIS COUNTRY AROUND HERE. AND HE SAID, "THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY, BUT IT DOESN'T COME UP TO HOME IN MY EYES." PICKETT'S CHARGE. HOW COME THERE WERE ONLY 50% CAS UALTI ES? IT JUST SEEMS LIKEA BLOODBATH. WELL, 50% IS ABOUT AS HIGH AS YOU'LL EVER GET. AHEM. UH, |-|-|T WAS AN INCREDIBLE MISTAKE, AND THERE'S SCARCELY ATRAINED SOLDIER WHO DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A MISTAKE AT THE TIME IT WAS DONE, EXCEPT POSSIBLY PICKETT HIMSELF, WHO WAS VERY HAPPY AT A CHANCE FOR GLORY, BUT EVERY MAN WHO LOOKED OUT OVER THAT FIELD, UH, WHETHER IT'S A SERGEANT OR A LIEUTENANT GENERAL, SAW THAT IT WAS A DESPERATE ENDEAVOR AND I'M SURE KNEW THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE. LONGSTREET BELIEVED THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE. HE SAID, "NO 15,000 MEN WHO EVER LIVED COULD MAKE THAT CHARGE." ACTUALLY, THERE WERE ABOUT 12,000. CUT, PLEASE. END OF ROLL. MAN: MARCH 28, 1978, AMERICAN DOCUMENTARIES, PROJECT TITLE "CIVIL WAR," CAMERA ROLL 177, SOUND ROLL 35, CONTINUATION OF INTERVIEW WITH SHELBY FOOTE, RECORDED FLAT, 7 1/2 IPS, -8 DB REFERENCE TONE TO FOLLOW. SOUND'S ROLLING, SPEED. AND...SLATE. WAIT FOR ME, AND OK. WHAT--WHAT THE HELL WAS SICKLES DOING ON JAN-- JULY 2? HE WAS, UH, CORRECTING WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A VULNERABLE POSITION. HE MOVED HIS TROOPS OUT SO AS TO NOT BE ON THIS-- ON THIS, UH, WHAT HE CONSIDERED VULNERABLE GROUND. THE REST OF THE ARMY WAS AMAZED. UH, SOMEBODY SAID HE STUCK OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB, AND SURE--AND, UH, |--| THINK IT WAS HANCOCK WHO SAW HIM GO OUT, AND HE SAID, "WAITAWHILE. YOU'LL SEE HIM TUMBLING BACK," AND OF COURSE, THEY DID. BUT HIS MOVEMENT REALLY CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ONE OF THE REALLY COLORFUL MOMENTS IN THE WAR. CAN YOU TELL ME JUST BRIEFLY ABOUT LITTLE ROUND TOP? WELL, UH, LITTLE ROUND TOP HAD ALREADY BEEN ATTACKED. UH, IT WAS PERHAPS THE KEY TO THE POSITION IF THEY COULD HAVE TAKEN IT UNLESS BIG ROUND TOP WAS, WHICH NOBODY TRIED TO TAKE, ALTHOUGH THEY MOVED ACROSS IT. UH, THIS WAS AN ATTACK AGAINST THE WHEAT FIELD AND THE BOTTOM OF THAT FISHHOOK SHANK, AND, UH, IT WAS LED BY BARKSDALE'S MISSISSIPPIANS, WHO MADE A CHARGE ALL THE WAY ACROSS, AND IT WAS A--|T WAS A HORRENDOUS THING TO DO, AND THEY H|T--THERE WAS A FENCE THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE TO STOP AND CLIMB OVER. THEY HIT IT, AND THE FENCE DISAPPEARED. THEY JUST DEMOLISHED THE FENCE, WALKED-- RAN RIGHT THROUGH IT AND ON UP THE RIDGE, AND GOT UP ON THE RIDGE ITSELF, BUT THEY WERE UP THERE BY THEMSELVES, AND THEY SOON WERE THROWN BACK AGAIN. UH, IT'S ONE OF THE COLORFUL CHARGES ACROSS THE WHEAT FIELDS AND ALL THAT |N--|N--AT GETTYSBURG. CAN YOU TELL ME IF JOSHUA-- CAN I STOP FOR A SECOND. YEAH. CUT. SLATE. CAN YOU TELL ME, UH, WHAT JOSHUA LAWRENCE CHAMBERLAIN DID THAT DAY THAT WAS 80 SPECTACULAR? WELL, UH, I DON'T REMEMBER TOO WELL. IT JUST THAT HE--UH, HE AND WARREN, UH, SAVED LITTLE ROUND TOP, WHICH MEANT SAVING THE POSITION. UH, THE DETAILS OF IT, ABOUT THE--THE CHARGES THAT CAUGHT THE CONFEDERATES OFF BATTLE AND ALL, I HAVE FORGOTTEN A GOOD DEAL OF. FINE. UM, LEE AND GETTYSBURG. THIS IS A MISTAKE, IS IT NOT? GETTYSBURG WAS THE PRICE THE SOUTH PAID FOR HAVING R.E. LEE. LEE WAS OFF-BALANCE AT GETTYSBURG IN SEVERAL WAYS, THE PRINCIPAL ONE BEING THE ABSENCE OF HIS CAVALRY. HE HAD ALWAYS COUNTED ON STUART AND HIS CAVALRY FOR INTELLIGENCE AS TO ENEMY POSITIONS AND MOVEMENTS, AND HE WAS LACKING THAT. HE WAS GROPING AROUND THE HOR-- UH, AROUND THE LANDSCAPE BLIND. AND PEOPLE WOULD COME UP TO HIM IN THE FIELD ALL THROUGH THOSE DAYS, AND HE SAID, "CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE STUART IS? HAVE YOU SEEN MY CAVALRY?" AVERY STRANGE THING FOR A COMMANDER TO HAVE TO ASK. SO THAT THAT PUT HIM OFF-BALANCE SOMEWHAT. THEN THE FIRST DAY'S FIGHTING WAS 80 ENCOURAGING, AND THE SECOND DAY'S FIGHTING, HE CAME WITHIN AN INCH OF DOING IT, AND BY THAT TIME, LONGSTREET SAID, "LEE'S BLOOD WAS UP." AND LONGSTREET SAID, "WHEN HIS BLOOD WAS UP, THERE WAS NO STOPPING HIM." LONGSTREET TRIED TO STOP HIM. AND LEE SAID, "NO, HE'S THERE," MEANING THE ENEMY, "AND I'M GONNA STRIKE HIM." AND THAT WAS THE MISTAKE HE MADE, THE MISTAKE OF ALL MISTAKES. DOES LEE DESERVE TO BE LIONIZED? YES, HE DOES DESERVE TO BE LIONIZED, IF EVER A MAN DID. UH, THE RESULTS OF LIONIZING SOMEBODY, HOWEVER, ARE UNFORTUNATE. THEY COVER THE TRUTH. THEY--THEY TURNED HIM INTO SOMETHING HE WASN'T. THERE IS A STORY ABOUT JACKRABBITS, AND--ALSO IN PICKETT'S CHARGE. THE UNION MEN WERE YELLING SOMETHING. IT'S REALLY IN REVERSE FROM A BATTLE BEFORE. THE--P|CKETT'S MEN AT GETTYSBURG WERE LINED UP FOR THE CHARGE ON THE THIRD DAY, AND THEY HAD A LONG WAIT. UH, THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GONNA DO, BUT THEY HAD TO WAIT. AND WHILE THEY WERE WAITING, FORMED AND READY TO MOVE OUT, THEY WERE IN DEFILADE, AMONG BRUSH, AND THINGS, AND A RABBIT JUMPED OUT OF THE BUSHES AND TOOK OFF REARWARD, AND ONE OF THE SOLDIERS LOOKED AFTER HIM AND HOLLERED, "RUN, OLD HARE. IF I WAS A OLD HARE, I'D RUN, TOO." HEH HEH HEH. SURE-SURE IT WASN'T ALL VALOR. HEH. WHAT WAS THE STORY ABOUT THE WHITWORTH RA—-R|FLE AT LITTLE ROUND TOP, AND THE GENERAL OPINION OF SHARPSHOOTERS, I'D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT. UH,THEn THE WHITWORTH RIFLE WAS A SHARPSHOOTER'S RIFLE, OFTEN WITH A GLASS SIGHT, AND WAS EFFECTIVE-- YOU'LL HAVE DIFFICULTY BELIEVING THIS-- ATA RANGE OF ABOUT 1,000 YARDS. UH, THERE WERE MEN DROPPED BY AIMED SHOTS ON LITTLE ROUND TOP BY SHARPSHOOTERS FROM ALL THE WAY BACK. AND, UH, THE GOOD INSTANCE OF THAT IS-- I'VE FORGOTTEN THEIR NAM ES-- BUT ONE GENERAL WAS DROPPED WITH A SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD, AND ANOTHER GENERAL, OR COLONEL-- I'VE FORGOTTEN WHICH-- LEANED OVER HIM TO SEE HOW HE WAS DOING AND ALSO GOT A SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD FROM THE SAME SHARPSHOOTER. THE--THAT'S ANOTHER INSTANCE OF THE WEAPONS BEING SO FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE TACTICS. UH, NOWADAYS WE WOULD KNOW TO STAY UNDER COVER AT THE-- AT A RANGE LIKE THAT, BUT THEN THEY THOUGHT IT WAS PERFECTLY SAFE TO BE AT A RANGE LIKE THAT. NOT SO. WHAT'S THE GENERAL OPINION OF SHARPSHOOTERS IN EACH ARMY? UH, SOLDIERS OF THAT WAR, JUST AS SOLDIERS IN ALL OTHER WARS, HAVE DESPISED SHARPSHOOTERS, EITHER THEIR OWN OR THE ENEMY. UH, THEY DON'T THINK THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE BATTLE, AND AS FOR KILLING AN INDIVIDUAL SOLDIER, THEY DON'T SEE ANYTHING GOOD ABOUT THAT IN ANY WAY, ESPECIALLY IN WHAT'S SORT OF A SNEAKY WAY. I WANT TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT AWAY, AND, UM, WHAT HAPPENED TO ROBERT GOULD SHAW'S BODY? IT WAS THROWN INTO THE BURIAL TRENCH WITH HIS BLACK SOLDIERS PURPOSEFULLY. CAN YOU ST—-SORT OF RETELL THE STORY FROM THE BEGINNING WITHOUT MY LEADING YOU? SHAW WAS FROM A PROMINENT BOSTON FAMILY, A STRONG ABOLITIONIST IN VIEWS, AND, UH, MANY BOSTONIANS WERE NOT ABOLITIONISTS BY A LONG SHOT AND DISAPPROVED OF IT. AND SHAW HAD FOUGHT BEFORE. HE HAD BEEN AT CHANCELLORSVILLE, FOR INSTANCE, AND HE WAS GIVEN COMMAND OF A NEGRO REGIMENT, AND, UH, MARCHED THROUGH BOSTON ON THEIR WAY DOWN THE COAST. THEY WERE PROUD MEN, THOSE BLACK SOLDIERS. THEY REFUSED PAY, SINCE IT WAS GONNA BE LESS THAN WHAT WHITE SOLDIERS GOT. THEY REFUSED TO TAKE ANY PAY AT ALL. UM, SHAW LED THE--THE|R ATTACK ON BATTERY WAGNER, WHICH IS SOMETIMES HERE CALLED "FORT WAGNER." HE LED THE CHARGE. THEY WERE CUT TO PIECES. THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE MADE THAT CHARGE, EITHER. AND, UH, WHEN IT WAS OVER, THE CONFEDERATES WERE IN CONTROL. AND, UH, THERE WAS VERY HARD FEELING AGAINST THE WHITE OFFICERS OF BLACK REGIMENTS, AND SHAW WAS SIMPLY THROWN IN THE BURIAL PIT WITH HIS SOLDIERS. UH, SHAW'S FATHER LATER SAID HE WAS PROUD TO HAVE HIM BURIED THAT WAY. WHAT WAS LINCOLN'S RESPONSE IN THE MOMENTS AFTER THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS TO HIS OWN ADDRESS AND PERFORMANCE? HE FELT THAT HE FAILED, THAT IT WAS A POOR SPEECH, THAT THE PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE IT. IT WAS SO BRIEF, LESS THAN TWO MINUTES. UH, HE--HE FELT THAT HE HAD FAILED. LAMON, HIS FRIEND, WARD LAMON, WAS SITTING NEXT TO HIM ON THE STAND, AND WHEN HE SAT DOWN, THERE WAS JUST A SPRINKLING OF APPLAUSE. AND HE SAID, "LAMON, THAT SPEECH WON'T SCOUR." THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT A PLOW IN THE PRAIRIES WHEN THE MUD DOESN'T COME OFF IT. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CONSCRIPTION. YOU SAID TO ME BEFORE THAT CONSCRIPTION WAS ASHOCK AND ALSO THAT ABE, FATHER ABE, GOT A $300 EXEMPTION. IF YOU COULD MAYBE JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DRAFT. UH, CONSCRIPTION WAS LOOKED ON IN THE SOUTH, WHERE THEY HAD IT FIRST, AS THE--AS THE COMPLETE DOWNFALL OF DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, AND EVERYTHING ELSE. WHEN THE CONSCRIPTION LAWS WERE PASSED, SOME OF THE SOUTHERN POLITICIANS, ESPECIALLY THE FlRE-EATERS, SAID IT MEANT THE END OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY IN THE CONFEDERACY. THEY WERE TOTALLY OPPOSED TO IT, BUT OF COURSE, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGHT WITHOUT CONSCRIPTION. JEFFERSON DAVIS MADE AGOOD SPEECH ABOUT, UH, HOW NOBODY WAS GONNA SIT BACK WHILE ONLY THE HEROES DID THE FIGHTING. AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN HAD A SUBSTITUTE OR BOUGHT A SUBSTITUTE. |--|--|'VE HEARD THAT, BUT I DON'T KNOW IT. UM, WHAT DID STANTON SAY ABOUT SERVICE TO ONE'S COUNTRY? THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE PRISON CELL-- THERE WERE A GREAT MANY MEN THROWN INTO PRISONS UNDER SUSPICION OF SEDITION AND THERE-- THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER, AND WHEN IT WAS PROTESTED TO STANTON, WHO HAD THROWN MOST OF THEM IN THERE-- WHEN IT WAS PROTESTED TO HIM, HE SAID, "| THINKA MAN CAN SERVE HIS COUNTRY IN PRISON AS WELL AS ANYWHERE ELSE." STONES RIVER. WHAT HAPPENS THERE? WHAT'S THE OUTCOME? IS IT IMPORTANT? STONES RIVER, THE CONFEDERATES USUALLY CALL IT MURFREESBORO, AND IT WAS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT. IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT BATTLES. IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT NEGLECTED BATTLES. UH, SO--SO MANY WESTERN BATTLES ARE NEGLECTED. STONES RIVER WAS A HUGE FIGHT. UH, SHERIDAN IS ONE OF THE STARS OF STONES RIVER. UH, THERE AGAIN, IT'S A GOOD CHANCE TO STUDY WESTERN-STYLE FIGHTING. IT'S A GREAT BATTLE. WHAT'S THE OUTCOME? THE OUTCOME WAS THE USUAL OUTCOME WITH BRAGG. IT WAS FOLLOWED BY A RETREAT. WHAT DID, UH, JACKSON SAY ON HIS DEATHBED? AND--AND ALSO, BACK UP A LITTLE BIT, AND REMIND ME ABOUT A.P. HILL, TOO. WHEN JACKSON LAY DYING, WHAT'S THE SCENE? THE SCENE IS IN A BEDROOM IN WHICH, UH, HE'S COMING IN AND OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS. UH, PNEUMONIA IS WHAT HE DIED OF, NOT THE LOSS OF HIS ARM, AND, UH, HIS WIFE GOT THERE TO BE WITH HIM. AND THE SURGEON, DR. MCGUIRE, TOLD, UH, MRS. JACKSON THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD DIE THAT DAY. AND, UH, SHE TOLD HIM-- SAID, UH, "THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT YOU WON'T LAST THE DAY OUT." AND HE SAID, UH, "OH, NO, MY CHILD. IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS." AND HE WENT OFF INTO SOME SORT OF SLEEPING AND DELIRIUM. PNEUMONIAAFFECTS PEOPLE IN STRANGE WAYS. AND THEN FINALLY SHE SAID, "YOU WILL BE WITH THE LORD THIS DAY." AND HE CALLED THE DOCTOR OVER AND HE SAYS, UH, "DOCTOR MCGUIRE, MY WIFE TELLS ME I'M GONNA DIE TODAY. IS THAT TRUE?" AND THE DOCTOR SAID, UH, "YES, IT IS." AND HE SAID, UH, "GOOD. VERY GOOD. I ALWAYS WANTED TO DIE ON A SUNDAY." AND WHEN THEY OFFERED HIM BRANDY OR MORPHINE, HE SAID, "NO. I WANT TO KEEP MY MIND CLEAR." AND, UH, THE LAST THING IS SAID IS SORT OF-- HE--HE--HE WANDERED IN HIS MIND. HE WAS CALLING ON A.P. HILL, "PREPARE FOR ACTION." AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS QUIET, VERY QUIET FOR A SPELL. AND HE SAID IN A CLEAR, DISTINCT VOICE, "LET US CROSS OVER THE RIVER AND REST UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES," AND THEN DIED. PERFECT TIMING. WOW. THANK YOU. THAT WAS GREAT. MAN: CUT! MARCH 28, 1987, AMERICAN DOCUMENTARIES, PROJECT TITLE "CIVIL WAR," CAMERA ROLL 178, SOUND ROLL 36, INTERVIEW WITH SHELBY FOOTE, RECORDED 7 1/2 IPS, FLAT, -8 DB REFERENCE TONE TO FOLLOW. Foote: 10,000 UNITS. SOUND'S ROLLING, SPEED. SLATE. CAN YOU PARAPHRASE WHAT YOUR FRIEND SAID? UH, WILLIAM FAULKNER IN "INTRUDER IN THE DUST" SAYS THAT FOR EVERY SOUTHERN BOY IT'S ALWAYS IN HIS REACH TO IMAGINE IT BEING 1:00 ON AN EARLY JULY DAY IN 1863. THE GUNS ARE LAID, AND THE TROOPS ARE LINED UP, THE FLAGS ARE ALREADY OUT OF THEIR CASES AND READY TO BE UNFURLED, BUT IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET, AND, UH, HE CAN GO BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE THE WAR WAS GONNA BE LOST, AND HE CAN ALWAYS HAVE THAT MOMENT FOR HIMSELF. IT'S A--|T'S A GOOD STATEMENT OF IT. AND YOU HAVE TO READ IT IN THE ORIGINAL TO GET THE REAL NOTION OF IT. MAN: CAN YOU, LIKE, PAUSE FOR JUST A SECOND? SURE. LET ME DO THIS. THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT, THOUGH. OK. CONTINUE. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE BLOODBATH AT CHICKAMAUGA AND TELL ME WHAT "CHICKAMAUGA" MEANS? "CHICKAMAUGA" IS, LIKE, ALL INDIAN WORDS, INTERPRETED TO MEAN "THE RIVER OF DEATH." MEANS--GOD KNOWS WHAT IT REALLY MEANS. YOU--YOU CAN TRANSLATE INDIAN WORDS ALMOST ANY WAY. UH, BUT CHICKAMAUGA MAY HAVE BEEN-- THE SECOND DAY AT CHICKAMAUGA MAY HAVE BEEN THE BLOODIEST DAY OF THE WAR. SHARPSBURG IS OFTEN CALLED THE BLOODIEST DAY OF THE WAR, AND YOU CAN MAKE GOOD AND VALID CLAIMS FOR SHARPSBURG BECAUSE IT WAS A ON E-DAY BATTLE. CHICKAMAUGA WAS A TWO-DAY BATTLE, AND OF COURSE, THE CASUALTIES WERE MUCH HEAVIER, BUT IF YOU DIVIDE THEM UP AS I THINK THEY WERE-- PROBABLY 2/3 OF THEM WERE ON THE SECOND DAY-- THEN THAT'S THE BLOODIEST DAY OF THE WAR. CHICKAMAUGA WAS A HORRENDOUS BATTLE. VERY--A LOT OF BREAKTHROUGHS, A LOT OF HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT, A LONG, RAGGED RETREAT, UH, A GLORIOUS SOUTHERN VICTORY, WHICH WAS UNEXPLOITED. UH, AND ALL THE WESTERN HEROES WERE THERE, FROM FORREST ON DOWN. UH, |T--|T WAS--|T'S-- IT'S A GREAT BATTLE. WHO'S ON THE NORTH? WHAT'S HAPPENING UP THERE? ROSECRANS WAS THE COMMANDER AND VARIOUS PEOPLE. GEORGE THOMAS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HOLDING HIS GROUND AND THEREFORE NOT MAKING THE BATTLE A TOTAL ROUTE. UH, SHERIDAN WAS THERE, UH, VARIOUS OF THOSE GENERALS. THE SOUTH BEGINS TO CRUMBLE FROM WITHIN JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING SQUEEZED, AND WE HAVE THINGS LIKE, UH, FOOD RIOTS, AND, UH, THINGS LIKE THAT. CAN YOU PAINT THAT KIND OF INTERNAL SORT OF BREAKING UP IN THE SOUTH? WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHAT ARE THE MANIFESTATIONS? ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE SOUTH IN THE COURSE OF THE WAR-- AND THIS HAPPENED VERY EARLY-- IT HAD BEGUN WITH THE NOTION THAT NORTHERNERS WOULD NOT FIGHT AND THAT SOUTHERNERS-- ONE SOUTHERN SOLDIER COULD WHIP 12 YANKEES AND SO FORTH, AND THEY VERY SOON REALIZED THERE WAS NO TRUTH IN THAT STATEMENT, AND IT CAME AS A GREAT SHOCK TO THEM. AND THINGS BEGAN TO CLOSE IN ON THEM MORE AND MORE. UH, THERE WAS SCARCELY A FAMILY THAT HADN'T LOST SOMEONE. UH, THERE WAS, UH... A DISRUPTION OF SOCIETY. THE BLOCKADE WAS WORKING. THEY COULDN'T GET VERY SIMPLE THINGS LIKE NEEDLES TO SEW WITH, UH, VERY SIMPLE THINGS. AND, UH, THE DISCOURAGEMENT BEGAN TO SETTLE IN MORE AND MORE WITH THE REALIZATION THAT THEY WERE NOT GONNA WIN THAT WAR. UH, THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD, ESPECIALLY JEFFERSON DAVIS, TO ASSURE THEM THAT THIS WAS THE SECOND AMERICAN REVOLUTION AND IF THEY WOULD, UH, STAND FAST THE WAY THEIR FOREFATHERS HAD THE VICTORY WAS UNQUESTIONABLY GONNA COME, BUT THE REALIZATION CAME MORE AND MORE THAT IT WAS NOT GONNA COME, ESPECIALLY THAT THEY WERE NOT GONNA GET FOREIGN RECOGNITION, WITHOUT WHICH WE WOULDN'T HAVE WON THE FIRST REVOLUTION. AND ALL THOSE THINGS CLOSED IN ON THEM. SO WHAT WAS HAPPENING? WHAT WERE SOME OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THAT? UH, IT WAS A REALIZATION THAT DEFEAT WAS FOREORDAINED. UH, ONE--MRS. CHESNUT, FOR INSTANCE, SAID, "IT'S LIKE IN A GREEK TRAGEDY, "WHERE YOU KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME IS BOUND TO BE, AND WE ARE LIVING IN GREEK TRAGEDY." WHAT'S WRONG WITH ROBERT E. LEE? WHAT ARE HIS FAULTS? |T'S--|T'S DIFFICULT TO DEFINE A FAULT OF LEE'S BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BALANCED BYAVIRTUE, BUT SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER, LEE'S LACK OF, UH-- OF INTELLECTUAL HUMOR |S--|S A SORT OF LACK IN HIM. HE MAY HAVE HAD IT, BUT WE'VE LOST IT, YOU SEE? UH, HE--HE, UH--HE DOES SEEM TO LACK THAT, SOMETHING THAT SHERMAN, FOR EXAMPLE HAD, AND EVEN GRANT. UH, GRANT WAS CAPABLE OF SAYING SOME VERY FUNNY THINGS. HE ONCE SAID HE ONLY KNEW TWO TUNES, AND ALL HE KNEW WAS ONE OF THEM "YANKEE DOODLE," AND THE OTHER WASN'T. UH, LEE NEVER SAID ANYTHING FAINTLY RESEMBLING THAT. UH, SHERMAN WOULD SAY ATHING LIKE, UH, "VOX POPULI, VOX HUMBUG." UH, BUT LEE--LEE--THERE-- THERE IS NO LEE QUOTE RESEMBLING THOSE THINGS. SPEAKING OF U.S. GRANT, CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SCENE OF HIS ARRIVAL AT THE WILLARD HOTEL IN, UH, MARCH OF '64? HE SIMPLY CAME IN. HIS, UH, SON WAS WITH HIM, AND ROLLINS WAS WITH HIM, ITHINK, AND HE WAS IN A RATHER WEATHERED UNIFORM. HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS 3 STARS ON YET BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOING TO GET HIS COMMISSION UNTIL THE NEXT DAY, BUT HE JUST WALKED UP TO THE DESK AND ASKED FOR A ROOM, AND, UH, THERE HAD BEEN AGREAT MANY GENERALS IN AND OUT OF WILLARD'S. PRACTICALLY ALL OF THEM HAD BEEN IN AND OUT OF WILLARD'S. AND THE DESK CLERK, UH, SAID, "WELL, I'VE GOT SOMETHING UP ON THE TOP FLOOR, IF THAT WILL DO," AND GRANT SAID, "THAT WILL DO FINE," AND HE GAVE HIM THE REGISTER TO SIGN, AND GRANT SIGNED IT. AND WHEN THE CLERK LOOKED DOWN AND SAW "U.S. GRANT AND SON, GALENA, ILLINOIS," HIS EYES BUGGED OUT OF HIS HEAD. WHY DID IT TAKE GRANT SO LONG TO REACH RICHMOND? THE GENIUS OF ROBERT E. LEE. MAN: CAN WE PAUSE ONCE AGAIN? YEAH. AND SET IT UP--| MEAN NOT SET IT UP, BUT JUST SAY, "THE GENIUS OF ROBERT E. LEE"-- THE GENlU--THE GENIUS OF ROBERT E. LEE IS WHY IT TOOK GRANT SO LONG TO TAKE RICHMOND. UH, GRANT SAID HE INTENDED TO FIGHT IT OUT ON THIS LINE IF IT TAKES ALL SUMMER. HE STAYED ON THAT LINE ABOUT 3 DAYS. HEH HEH HEH. |T'S--UH, IT IS-- LEE'S GENERALSHIP IN DEFENSIVE WARFARE FROM THE RAPIDAN TO THE JAMES IS, UH, NEAR MIRACULOUS. UH, IT'S AS IF HE LIVED IN GRANT'S MIND, KNEW WHAT HE WAS GONNA DO BEFORE HE DID IT. WHAT WAS SHERIDAN DOING IN THE VALLEY? HE WAS SENT THERE TO CLEAR IT OUT ONCE AND FOR ALL. UH, HIS INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO STRIP IT SO CLEAN THAT A CROW FLYING ACROSS IT WOULD HAVE TO CARRY HIS OWN PROVENDER. AND HE CAME CLOSE TO DOING IT. WHY DID ANDERSONVILLE HAPPEN? ANDERSONVILLE HAPPENED, UH, BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF FOOD, BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF PRISONERS, UH, WHICH THE SOUTH WAS NOT ABLE TO LOOK AFTER. UH, THE PRISONER AT ANDERSONVILLE GOT THE SAME RATION THAT THE CONFEDERATE SOLDIER GOT, BUT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO FORAGE AROUND FOR WILD GREENS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. UH, |T--|T WAS A DIRECT RESULT OF GRANT REFUSING TO EXCHANGE PRISONERS ANY LONGER. UH, AND HE HAD EVERY RIGHT TO REFUSE THAT BECAUSE IT WAS A HUGE NORTHERN ADVANTAGE. SWAPPING MAN FOR MAN WAS A BAD--A BAD THING FOR HIM TO DO. SO THEY HAD THE PROBLEM OF THE OVERCROWDING, AND, UH, THEY HAD TO GET THEM THAT FAR FROM THE FRONT LINES SO THAT ESCAPEES WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET OVER THE LINE. UH, I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED, UH, THAT ANYBODY WAS PURPOSELY CRUEL TO THOSE MEN. UH, AGREAT DEAL OF THE TROUBLE WAS THE MEN THEMSELVES. THEY HAD COMPLETELY LOST DISCIPLINE IN THE CAMP. AND NO WONDER, THE CONDITIONS THEY WERE LIVING UNDER, BUT IF THEY HAD BEEN-- HAD MILITARY ORGANIZATION-- AND YOU MUST REMEMBER, THERE WERE NO OFFICERS THERE. THEY WERE ALL ENLISTED MEN IN THAT CAMP. UH, THEY WOULD HAVE DONE A LOT BETTER, ESPECIALLY FOR SANITARY REASONS. AT ANDERSONVILLE, THERE WERE MOBS OF, UH--OF MEN WHO, UH, ATTACKED OTHER GROUPS, AND, UH, TERRIBLE THINGS WENT ON THERE. ATERRIBLE CHAPTER. AND THE--THE--THE REFUSAL TO--TO EXCHANGE IS A--THE|R DEATH SENTENCE. RIGHT. ANOTHER DEATH SENTENCE IS THE STATE OF MEDICAL CARE. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT? UH, I DON'T KNOWA LOT ABOUT MEDICAL CARE. UH, WHEN YOU SEE THE INSTRUMENTS THAT THE DOCTORS USED IN SURGERY, IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOUR HAIR STAND ON END, THE BONE SAWS AND THINGS. UH, I'M SURE THEY DID THEY BEST THEY COULD. IN MANY INSTANCES, ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE, THEY DIDN'T HAVE MEDICINES TO USE. LACK OF CHLOROFORM, FOR INSTANCE, DURING AMPUTATIONS, IS A HORRIBLE THING TO CONTEMPLATE. UH, I THINK THAT THEY DID VERY WELL, CONSIDERING THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE GERM THEORY. UH, CHIMBORAZO HOSPITAL IN RICHMOND IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN THE FINEST MILITARY HOSPITAL UP TILL THAT TIME IN HISTORY. UH, THEY--THEY—-THEY DID THE BEST THEY COULD, ISUPPOSE. BUT THE SUFFERING WAS--WAS INCREDIBLE. SHELBY, WHAT'S A COPPERHEAD? A COPPERHEAD IS A-- A PERSON WHO IS OPPOSED TO THE WAR IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IN THE SECOND PLACE, INCLINED TO BE PRO-SOUTHERN IN HIS BELIEFS. NOT NECESSARILY, THOUGH, JUST OPPOSED TO THE WAR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, AND THEY WERE CALLED COPPERHEADS BECAUSE THEY WOULD TAKE APENNY AND, UH, MAKE A LAPEL PIN OF IT BY CUTTING OUT THE HEAD AND UH--AND, UH, NOT ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S HEAD, THE WAY IT IS ON THE PENNY NOWADAYS, BUT WHATEVER IT WAS ON THE PENNY. AND THAT WAS THE PIN THAT THEY WORE TO IDENTIFY EACH OTHER. WHAT DID LEE SEE--SAY ABOUT THE COMMITTEE ON THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR? YOU MEAN LINCOLN? THAT'S A NORTHERN THING. OH, ABOUT--L|KE, IT'S LIKE HAVING TWO DIVISIONS OR SOMETHING? I THOUGHT IT WAS LEE. DON'T--DON'T KNOW THAT. UM, WHAT'S THE STORY ABOUT NASHVILLE, AND "HOLD THE HILL AT ANY COST"? IT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE OF THE STILTED WAY MEN SPOKE. YOU SCARCELY BELIEVE IT. UH, HOOD--ON THE SECOND DAY, UH, THERE WAS ATEXAS OUTFIT. AND HE SAID, UH, "I WANT YOU TO HOLD THIS HILL AT ALL COSTS." AND THE COLONEL COMMANDING THE REGIMENT THAT WAS GIVEN THE ASSIGNMENT SAID, UH, "GENERAL, WE WILL ENDEAVOR TO DO OUR BEST UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES." AND IT'S, UH, THAT KIND OF TALK, AND I'M SURE THEY DID TALK THAT WAY, BUT IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. WHAT HAPPENED AT NASHVILLE? OR FRANKLIN IS A BETTER EXAM--A BETTER BATTLE. FRANKLIN IS A HORRENDOUS BATTLE. THE CHARGE AT FRANKLIN, UH, WAS A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT CHARGE THAN LEE'S CHARGE AT GETTYSBURG, AND THE CASUALTIES WERE AS HIGH, AND THE FLOWER OF THE ARMY FELL. THERE'S A STRONG SUSPICION THAT HOOD WAS TRYING TO DISCIPLINE HIS ARMY BY STAGING THAT CHARGE AT FRANKLIN. AND THERE'S SOME TRUTH IN IT. UH, HE WAS EXASPERATED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT SPRING HILL SHORTLY BEFORE THAT, AND, UH, THE IDEA WAS HE PUT THE IRON TO THEM. HIS--H|S ARMY WAS WRECKED, AND THE--THE DEFEAT AT NASHVILLE WAS IN LARGE PART DUE TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT FRANKLIN A MONTH BEFORE. CUT, PLEASE. RUN-OUT. NOW WE'LL TAKE A-- MAN: MARCH 28, 1987, AMERICAN DOCUMENTARIES, PROJECT TITLE "CIVIL WAR," CAMERA ROLL 179, SOUND ROLL 37, CONTINUATION OF INTERVIEW WITH SHELBY FOOTE, RECORDED FLAT 7 1/2 IPS, -8 DB REFERENCE TONE TO FOLLOW. SOUND'S ROLLING, SPEED. SLATE. SHELBY, | WAS AT LUNCH A FEW MINUTES AGO, AND I WAS TALKING TO A FELLOW ABOUT, UH, SOME LINCOLN STORY ABOUTA BAPTIST PREACHER. WHAT'S THAT STORY? UH, LINCOLN TOLD IT IN CONNECTION WITH HIS SECRETARY OF WAR EDWIN STANTON, WHO WAS A VERY VOLATILE, JUMPING ABOUT, UH, VEHEMENT SORT OF PERSON. AND SOMEONE, UH, TOLD LINCOLN THEY THOUGHT HE WAS HYPERACTIVE. AND LINCOLN SAID, "YEAH, HE PUTS ME IN MIND "OF A PREACHER IN ILLINOIS. "HE WAS A FIRE AND BRIMSTONE PREACHER, "AND HE USED TO JUMP UP AND DOWN A LOT, "AND THE CONGREGATION DECIDED SOMETHING HAD "TO BE DONE ABOUT IT, SO THEY PUT BRICKS IN HIS COAT POCKETS TO HOLD HIM DOWN." HE SAID, "WE MAY HAVE TO DO THAT TO STANTON SOONER OR LATER." HEH HEH. WHAT ABOUT JACKSON'S STATEMENT AT FREDERICKSBURG? WHAT WAS--WHAT DID HE SAY? WELL, AFTER THE BATTLE OF FREDERICKSBURG, THE-- WHY DON'T YOU START AGAIN? I'M SORRY. ISTEPPED ON YOUR LINE. AFTER THE BATTLE OF FREDERICKSBURG, THE CONFEDERATES WENT BACK INTO THE TOWN, AND THEY SAW ALL THE DAMAGE THAT HAD BEEN DONE DURING THE UNION OCCUPATION OF THE TOWN. IT WAS A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE, REAL VANDALISM, AND THEY WERE SHOCKED, AND, UH, SOMEONE ON JACKSON'S STAFF SAID, "HOW ARE GONNA PUT AN END TO ALL THIS KIND OF THING?" AND JACKSON SAID, "KILL THEM. KILL THEM ALL." WHAT HAPPENED WHEN ENLISTMENTS CAME UP? WHAT DID MEN DO? HOW DO YOU MEAN? WELL, I MEAN, DID THEY TAKE OFF? DID THEY RUN AWAY WHEN THEIR ENLISTMENTS COME OUT? DID THEY JUST LEAVE BATTLE? OH, THERE-THERE WAS NO EXPIRATION OF ENLISTMENTS ON THE CONFEDERATE SIDE. THEY WERE IN FOR THE WAR. THERE WERE EXPIRATION OF ENLISTMENTS ON THE UNION SIDE AND PLENTY OF THEM. AND, UH--FOR INSTANCE, IN THE TRENCHES AT, UH-- AT COLD HARBOR, THERE WERE MEN WHOSE TIME WAS UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTLE--THE BATTLE AND LEFT, CRAWLING ON ALL FOURS TO KEEP FROM BEING KILLED WHILE YOU'RE GETTING AWAY. THERE WAS A LOT OF THAT, AND THERE WAS ALSO A LOT OF CAMPAIGNING FOR THEM TO SIGN ON FOR ANOTHER HITCH, AND MANY DID. COULD YOU REMIND ME OF THE TERROR THAT FARMERS FELT IN NEW YORK-- UPPER NEW YORK STATE ABOUT GOING TO THE POST OFFICE, AND REMEMBER MY QUESTION'S NOT IN IT? THE POSTING OF CASUALTY LISTS IN TOWNS ALL OVER AMERICA, NORTH AND SOUTH, WAS A—-|T MUST HAVE BEEN A HORRENDOUS EXPERIENCE, PEOPLE, UH, LOOKING, AND DISMAYED BY FINDING NAMES ON IT AND ELATED BY NOT FINDING NAMES ON IT. THEY WERE POSTED IN SOME CENTRAL LOCATION, USUALLY, PROBABLY THE POST OFFICE. UH, IT WAS A—-A--A THING THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT SINCE THEN. UH, YOU MUST REMEMBER, THERE WERE WELL OVER A MILLION CASUALTIES IN A COUNTRY THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY 30 OR 35 MILLION PEOPLE, AND, UH, THAT'S--THAT—- THAT INVOLVES AN AWFUL LOT OF FAMILIES. IN THE SOUTH ESPECIALLY, THERE WAS SCARCELY A FAMILY THAT WASN'T TOUCHED BY DEATH IN THAT WAR. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS TO ATOWN THAT MIGHT LOSE ALL ITS MEN WHO WERE CLUSTERED IN ONE REGIMENT AND THE REGIMENT GOT DESTROYED? YOU--YOU--YOU DO HAVE, UH, A BIG PROBLEM WHEN YOU HAVE UNITS THAT ARE FROM STATES AND COUNTIES AND EVEN TOWNS, AND ONE OF THOSE REGIMENTS CAN GET IN A VERY TIGHT SPOT IN A PARTICULAR BATTLE, LIKE IN THE CORNFIELD AT SHARPSBURG, AND THE NEWS MAY BE THAT THERE ARE NO MORE YOUNG MEN IN THAT TOWN. UH, THEY'RE ALL DEAD. AND THAT HAPPENED, UH, TO UNITS. UH, CLARKSVILLE, TENNESSEE, | ONCE SAW SOME FIGURES ON HOW MANY MEN THEY SENT TO WAR AND HOW MANY CAME BACK, AND YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE-- YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE LOW NUMBER THAT CAME BACK. DIDN'T THE SOUTH HAVE A LOT OF REAL CRAZY ESPIONAGE SCHEMES FOR BLOWING THINGS UP AND KIDNAP? THEY--THEY HAD A LOT OF SCHEMES. THE ST. ALBANS THING IN VERMONT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS REALLY CARRIED OUT AS A MILITARY OPERATION. UH, THERE WERE OTHER THINGS. THERE WAS A KIND OF A CIA, UH, OPERATING. UH, BEN BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS BOAT NEARLY GOT BLOWN UP BYA BOMB THAT WAS, UH, MADE TO RESEMBLE A PIECE OF COAL AND THROWN IN AMONG THE COAL THAT THE STEVEDORES WERE THROWING IN THE BOILER. AND IT WENT OFF, BUT IT DIDN'T DO AS MUCH DAMAGE AS THEY HAD CALCULATED ON. THERE WAS A CLOCKWORK, UH, MECHANISM SET AT GRANT'S HEADQUARTERS AT CITY POINT. IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST TERRIFIC EXPLOSIONS OF THE WAR. IT WAS A SMALL ClGAR-BOX-SIZE THING FULL OF BLACK POWDER, BUT IT SET OFF A LOT OF OTHER AMMUNITION. THEY DESCRIBED |T—- AND I'VE HEARD ABOUT |T—- IT BLEW UP A—- ASUPPLY BOAT WHICH HAD AVERY LARGE NUMBER OF SADDLES ON IT, AND THEY SAID THE SADDLES WERE FLYING THROUGH THE AIR LIKE BATS. HA HA HA! ALL THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH FLYING SADDLES. AND DIDN'T THEY WANT TO KIDNAP LINCOLN AND BURN DOWN NEW YORK? NO. UH, THE--THE--THE PLAN TO BURN DOWN NEW YORK WAS, I THINK, A--A SORT OF PLAN BYA GROUP OF-- OF SOME SORT, NOT OFFICIAL. THE ST. ALBANS THING WAS OFFICIAL, AND THEY CARRIED, UM, WHAT THEY CALLED VIALS OF GREEK FIRE TO THROW THAT WOULD BURN, AND THERE WAS SOME ATTEMPT TO BURN DOWN BARNUM'S AND A COUPLE OF OTHER PLACES IN NEW YORK, BUT IT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL AT ALL. WHAT'S THE DOUBLE CANNON THING, WHERE THEY WANTED TO HOOK UP--WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT? AND DESCRIBE IT. OH, THEY HAD MANY CRAZY IDEAS, UH, ALONG WITH SOME GOOD ONES. UH, THERE WAS PLAN TO USE TWO CANNON, EACH WITH A CANNONBALL, AND THE TWO CANNONBALLS CONNECTED BY A CHAIN. AND YOU WOULD FIRE THE TWO CANNONS AT THE SAME TIME, AND THE BALLS WOULD GO OUT, AND THE CHAIN BETWEEN THEM WOULD JUST CUT A SWATH THROUGH EVERYTHING IN THE WAY. THE TROUBLE WAS, ONE CANNON, OF COURSE, WENT OFF BEFORE THE OTHER ONE DID, WITH THE RESULT THAT THE BALL WENT AROUND IN A CIRCLE FROM THE OTHER CANNON. HOW WAS SHERMAN'S MARCH A DE--NEW DEPARTURE IN WAR? IT WAS NOT REALLY A NEW DEPARTURE. UH, SHERMAN HAD MADE AVERY SIMILAR MARCH IN MISSISSIPPI WHEN HE WENT UP TO MERIDIAN AND BACK AFTER THE VICKSBURG SIEGE. UH, GRANT MADE A MARCH SIMILAR TO THAT DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF THE VICKSBURG CAMPAIGN. GRIERSON'S RAID DOWN THROUGH THE LENGTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI TO BATON ROUGE WAS ASIMILAR THING. IT HAD BEEN THE CUMULATIVE EVIDENCE THAT AN ARMY COULD SUBSIST ITSELF ON WHAT WAS GROWING IN THE FIELDS, WINTER OR SUMMER. AND, UH, THEY--THEY WERE A—-A MOVING CITY, LIKE. THEY WOULD GRIND THEIR OWN CORN, UH, AT THE GRIST MILLS ALONG THE WAY, UH, BUTCHER THEIR OWN CATTLE, AND, UH, THEY WERE--THEY WERE--THEY WERE SAT-- SHERMAN WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED HE COULD MAKE THE MARCH WITHOUT DIFFICULTY WITH REGARD TO SUPPLIES. IN FACT, THEY--UH, THEY ATE BETTER ON THAT MARCH THAN THEY DID NOT MARCHING. SWEET POTATOES WERE PARTICULARLY PRIZED AND PORK. THEY HAD PLENTY TO EAT. LET'S CUT FOR THAT PLANE. AHEM. MAN: SOUND'S ROLLING, SPEED. SLATE. WHAT WAS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE MARCH? WHAT--WHAT DID HE WANT TO DO? THEY WANTED TO DO 2 OR 3 THINGS. ONE OF THEM, OF COURSE, WAS TO MOVE OVER TO THE EAST AND JOIN GRANT FOR PUTTING THE-- PUT AN END TO THE ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA UNDER LEE. THAT WAS ONE THING. THE OTHER WAS TO CLOSE THE EASTERN SEABOARD. UH, THE MARCH WAS FROM ATLANTA TO THE SEA, AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE SEA, THEY WOULD CLOSE DOWN THE VARIOUS PORTS THERE, UH, THE--THE FEW THAT WERE STILL OPEN. AND THE THIRD AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT THING, ALTHOUGH THEY MAY NOT HAVE REALIZED IT AT THE INCEPTION, WAS TO WIN THE ELECTION. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER WAS COMING UP POLITICALLY, IT WOULD BE A GREAT COUP, AND IT WOULD--UH, IT WOULD, UH, DO A LOT, JUST AS TAKING ATLANTA HAD WON LINCOLN THE ELECTION, 80 THIS WOULD WIN THE--THE MIDTERM ELECTION THAT WOULD BE COMING UP OR ANYHOW GIVE THE ARMY A GOOD PRESS. WHAT'S THE BILL ARP JOKE? UH, BILLARP, UH, WAS ACONFEDERATE HUMORIST, AND HE WAS A SOLDIER AND--AND A HUMORIST, AND WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER, HE SAID--THE QUOTE |S-- "I'VE KILLED AS MANY OF THEM "AS THEY HAVE OF ME. I'M GOING HOME." THERE'S ALSO A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING, UH, COMMENT ABOUT--THAT SOMEONE MADE THAT'S VERY NICE ABOUT THE MOON AFTER THE WAR. WHAT IS THAT STORY? DON'T REMEMBER. ABOUT IT BEING--YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE THE WAR? OH, "YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE THE WAR." YEAH, THAT'S THE JOKE. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. UH, CAN YOU--CAN YOU TELL THAT JOKE? WELL, |T—-|T—- "BEFORE THE WAR" WAS AN EXPRESSION THAT YOU HEARD ALL THE TIME, HOW IT WAS BEFORE THE WAR, AND SOMEONE WAS ADMIRING THE MOON. AND SOMEONE ELSE SAID, "OH, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE THE WAR." THAT'S ALL THERE WAS TO IT. WHAT? YOU'D LIKE HIM TO SAY IT AGAIN. OK. COULD YOU ONE MORE TIME, SHELBY. SORRY. SOMEBODY SAID, "GEE THE MOON IS BEAUTIFUL." "BEFORE THE WAR" IS ACOMMON EXPRESSION USED THROUGHOUT THE--UH, NOT ONLY DURING THE WAR BUT WELL AFTER THE WAR, AND, UH, "BEFORE THE WAR" WAS THE EXPRESSION, AND SOMEONE ONCE SAID, "HOW BEAUTIFUL THE MOON IS TONIGHT." AND THE OTHER ONE SAID, "YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE THE WAR." WHAT'S THE STORY ABOUT THE--THE VETERAN WHO LOST HIS LEG, AND HE LOOKS DOWN ON THE LADY? THAT HAPPENED--UH, TWO OLD LADIES WERE VISITING AN OLD SOLDIERS HOME WHERE CONFEDERATE VETERANS WERE STAYING. AND, UH, AS THEY WALKED THROUGH, THEY CAME TO A MAN WHO WAS IN AWHEELCHAIR. AND, UH, ONE OF HIS LEGS HAD BEEN CUT OFF. AND THE WOMAN LOOKED DOWN AND SAID, "OH, MY POOR MAN, YOU'VE LOST YOUR LEG." AND HE LOOKED DOWN AND SAID, "DAMNED IF I HAVEN'T." HA HA HA! WHAT HAPPENED TO SICKLES THAT WAS 80 FUNNY? WHAT WAS HIS FATE? WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AFTER THE WAR? OH, AFTER THE WAR, HE HAD AVERY MUCH PUBLICIZED, UH, AFFAIR WITH THE NYMPHOMANIAC EX-QUEEN OF SPAIN, BUT, UH, SICKLES DID A LOT OF THINGS. DID THE WAR GET RID OF SLAVERY, OR WHAT REPLACED IT? WHAT REPLACED SLAVERY WAS PEONAGE, WHICH IN SOME WAYS WAS CRUELER THAN SLAVERY. UH, THEY WERE LOCKED UP INTOASITUATION THAT RESEMBLED SLAVERY WITHOUT ANY OF THE BENEFITS, SUCH AS BEING OBLIGED TO KEEP YOU WHEN YOU'RE OLD OR FEED YOU WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY. UH, THAT LASTED AVERY LONG TIME. UH, WHEN I WAS A BOY IN MISSISSIPPI, UH, THE CONDITION OF THE BLACKS WAS NOT GREATLY DIFFERENT FROM SLAVERY BECAUSE THE DEPRESSION HAD THAT EFFECT ON THEM. THEY WERE UNABLE TO MOVE OR GO ANYWHERE, AND THERE WAS NOBODY TO LOOK AFTER THEM. IT WAS A--A BAD SITUATION IN MANY WAYS. WHO DREW CONFEDERATE PENSIONS? YOU TOLD US ABOUT IT. THEY WERE STATE PENSIONS ALWAYS, AND, UH, EACH STATE PENSIONED ITS CONFEDERATE VETERANS. THERE WERE NO NATIONAL PENSIONS, OF COURSE, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO NATION, AND THEY COULDN'T DRAW A PENSION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, BUT THEY DID DRAW FROM THEIR STATES, AND THERE WERE OLD SOLDIER HOMES. WHEN I WAS A BOY, I GUESS ALL THE OLD VETERANS HAD BEEN DRUMMER BOYS, BUT, UH, I SAW PLENTY OF THEM. JEFFERSON DAVIS' FORMER HOME, BEAUVOIR, DOWN NEAR BILOXI, UH, WAS AN OLD SOLDIER'S HOME. |V|S|TED THERE WHEN THERE WAS STILL ABOUT 15 OR 20 OLD VETERANS THERE. CUT, PLEASE. ROLL OUT. MAN WHISTLING MAN: MARCH 28, 1987, AMERICAN DOCUMENTARIES, PROJECT TITLE "CIVIL WAR," CAMERA ROLL 180, SOUND ROLL 38, CONTINUATION OF INTERVIEW WITH SHELBY FOOTE, RECORDED FLAT 7 1/2 IPS, -8 DB REFERENCE TONE TO FOLLOW. BURNS: YEAH, I KNOW. SOUND'S ROLLING, SPEED. SLATE. DID IT MATTER WHO WON? UH, YES. |T--|T--|T MATTERED WHO WON, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DIDN'T ALWAYS KNOW WHO WAS GONNA WIN. UH, IT MATTERED THAT THE NORTH WON, BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I THINK THERE WAS NEVER ANY DOUBT THAT THE NORTH WAS GOING TO WIN. WHY, FROM A MORE MORAL POINT OF VIEW WAS IT RIGHT FOR THE NORTH TO WIN? I DON'T THINK THAT IT WAS NECESSARILY RIGHT FROM A MORAL POINT OF VIEW. I DON'T IDENTIFY THAT AS STRICTLYA WAR AGAINST OR FOR SLAVERY. UH, ITHINK THE IMPORTANT THING WAS THE THING LINCOLN STRESSED ALL THE WAY, WHETHER THIS EXPERIMENT COULD SUCCEED OR WHETHER IT WOULD SPLIT IN TWO IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING. DID YOUR PEOPLE DIE IN VAIN? UH, IN A LARGER SENSE, ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO WAS INVOLVED IN IT DIED IN VAIN. UH, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT "IN VAIN" REALLY MEANS. A—-A GOOD DEATH IS NOT IN VAIN EVER. WHAT MADE THESE MEN FIGHT? WHY WOULD YOU GO UP TO CEMETERY RIDGE, KNOWING FULL WELL? THE MAIN REASON YOU DID IT WAS BECAUSE THE MAN NEXT TO YOU DID IT. UH, IT WAS UNIT PRIDE. IF A UNIT WAS TOLD TO GO SOMEWHERE, THEY WENT OUT OF PRIDE. UH, IF YOU STOP TO THINK ABOUT IT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH HARDER NOT TO GO THAN TO GO. IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A GREAT DEAL OF COURAGE TO SAY, "MARSE ROBERT, IAIN'T GOING." UH, NOBODY'S GOT THAT MUCH COURAGE. IT'S, UH--|T—-|T'S NOT EASY FOR US TO UNDERSTAND. UH, THE HARDEST THING TO UNDERSTAND FOR ME WAS THE NAVAL FIGHTING. THERE WERE MEN WITH 8—lN--8—|NCH GUNS FIRING AT EACH OTHER FROM A RANGE OF 8 FEET. UH, THAT'S--THAT'S INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME, BUT THEY DID IT. WAS THE WAR NECESSARY? IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT NECESSARY. UH, IF OUR TRUE GENIUS FOR COMPROMISE HAD COME INTO EFFECT, THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A WAR. WE DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT AS OUR GENIUS. IN FACT, WE'RE VERY PROUD TO STATE-- AND WE OFTEN DO, THAT WE NEVER COMPROMISE. IT IS OUR TRUE GENIUS. AND IF IT HAD BEEN IN OPERATION, WE WOULD HAVE AVOIDED THE WAR. IT'S CALLED A "IRREPRESSIBLE CON"-- UH, "IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT." I THINK, UH, SEWARD CALLED IT THAT, AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THE NATION WITHOUT HAVING FOUGHT THAT WAR, AND IT IS JUST BARELY POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD NEVER HAVE TESTED IT WITHOUT AWAR, BUT I DON'T LIKE TO THINK THAT. WAS IT A NECESSARY-- WAS THE WAR NECESSARY? I THINK, AS I SAY, THAT IT PROBABLY WAS NOT NECESSARY, BUT SINCE IT DID HAPPEN, IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF IT NOT HAPPENING. SO THAT IN THAT SENSE, |T CERTAINLY WAS NECESSARY FOR US TO BE WHAT WE ARE. CERTAINLY, WE ARE WHAT WE ARE AS A RESULT OF THAT WAR. IN THAT SENSE, IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. WHY SHOULD WE BE 125 YEARS LATER SYMPATHETIC TO THE SOUTH? BECAUSE THE SOUTH CONDUCTED ITSELF BRAVELY IN AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT SITUATION. MANY OF THE THINGS WE ARE PROUDEST OF IN THE AMERICAN CHARACTER WERE EXEMPLIFIED BY THE SOUTHERN SOLDIER, FOR INSTANCE. UH, WE--WE--WE TAKE AJUSTIFIABLE PRIDE IN THE BRAVERY OF THOSE MEN, NORTH AND SOUTH. WHAT'S A TRUE SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN? WHAT DO PEOPLE MEAN WHEN THEY SAY, "TRUE SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN"? I THINK USUALLY THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT MANNERS, UH, WHICH REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH IT, BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S MEANT. IT'S A--A--A FORM OF POLITENESS, PERHAPS WITH A LITTLE SOMETHING FLORID IN IT, PERHAPS. UH, ANYWAY, THAT'S THE NOTION. SHERMAN ONCE COUNTED OFF THE MAJOR TYPES OF SOUTHERNERS, ENDING WITH THE YOUNGBLOODS OF THE SOUTH, IMPLYING THESE RASH, RECKLESS RASCALS. RIGHT, RIGHT. UM, WHO ARE THESE MEN? WHAT--WHO WAS HE TALKING ABOUT? UH, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT REALLY DID EXIST. THEY WERE DUELISTS. UH, ANY MAN CROSSED THEM, THEY WOULD CALL HIM OUT AND SHOOT HIM. UH, FLAMBOYANT IN MANNER. UH, THEY WERE MOST OF THEM NOT GENTLEMEN AT ALL, NO MATTER WHAT THEY WERE JUSTIFIED IN THINKING THEY COULD CALL THEMSELVES. THERE WAS THAT TYPE, AND I KNOW WHAT SHERMAN WAS TALKING ABOUT. IN FACT, SOME OF IT APPLIES TO WHAT ARE CALLED GOOD OLD BOYS. UM, THEY--HE SAID, "THEY NEVER WORKED A DAY "IN THEIR LIFE AND NEVER INTENDED TO. "THEY LOVE WAR, AND THEY GO INTO IT "WITH GREAT JOY, "AND IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY WAR, THEY WOULD BE EXTREMELY UNHAPPY." HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE GONNA DO TO THE SOUTH AFTER THE WAR AND HOW THEY WOULD PUT AN END TO THIS KIND OF THING. HE SPECIFICALLY NAMED FORREST AS AMONG THE PEOPLE THAT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT. HE WAS WRONG ON THAT. WHAT IS THE "LOST CAUSE?" THE "LOST CAUSE" IS THE CONFEDERACY. UH, UH, IT IS REFERRED TO AS "THE LOST CAUSE." ON THE CONFEDERATE MONUMENT IN MY HOMETOWN OF GREENVILLE, MISSISSIPPI, THE CONFEDERACY IS REFERRED TO AS "THE ONLY NATION THAT EVER--WAS EVER BORN "AND DIED WITHOUTA SIN HAVING BEEN COMMITTED ON ITS PART. " AND, UH, A LOT OF PEOPLE, UH, HAVE THAT VIEW OF IT. LOST THINGS ARE ALWAYS PRIZED VERY HIGHLY. IF THAT IS THE LOST CAUSE, WHAT |S--WHAT'S THE FOUND CAUSE? WHAT WAS THE NORTH FIGHTING FOR? AHEM. THAT IS A--MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO SAY THAN IT IS TO SAY WHAT THE SOUTH WAS FIGHTING FOR, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS DAVIS HAD AN EASIER JOB THAN LINCOLN. THE ANSWER TO-- A SOUTHERNER WOULD GIVE YOU AS, "WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING?" IF YOU WERE ANORTHERNER, HE WOULD SAY, "I'M FIGHTING BECAUSE YOU'RE DOWN HERE." UH, HE WAS BEING INVADED, AND HE FOUGHT, AS HE THOUGHT, TO DEFEND HIS HOME. LINCOLN HAD THE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT JOB OF SENDING MEN OUT TO, UH, SHOOT UP SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOME, AND, UH, HE HAD TO UNITE THEM BEFORE HE COULD DO THAT. AND HIS WAY OF DOING IT WAS DOUBLE. ONE WAS TO SAY THAT, UH, "THE REPUBLIC MUST BE PRESERVED, NOT SPLIT IN TWO." THAT WAS ONE, AND THE OTHER ONE HE GAVE THEM AS A CAUSE, THE FREEING OF THE SLAVES. SO THOSE TWO THINGS. THE SECOND ONE WAS ESPECIALLY A—-A--A DANGEROUS THING TO FOOL WITH BECAUSE HE MIGHT HAVE LOST KENTUCKY AND MISSOURI IF HE HAD DONE IT EARLIER. HE HAD TO WAIT FOR THE RIGHT TIME, WHEN IT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE FOR KENTUCKY OR MISSOURI TO LEAVE THE UNION. WHAT WAS THE COUNTRY LIKE THAT WENT TO WAR? YOU KNOW, WHAT'S A MEAL COST AT DELMONICO'S? YOU KNOW, SORT OF SET THE SCENE FOR ME. IT CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE ABEAUTIFUL, BUCOLlC-- |T--|T'S DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT PRICES OF THINGS IN MY OWN LIFETIME. WHEN I TELL PEOPLE WHAT THINGS COST IN 1934, THEY SIMPLY FLATLY DO NOT BELIEVE ME. UM, WHEN I TELL THEM THAT A FULL-TIME SERVANT WORKING DAY LONG AND INTO THE NIGHT COST $3.00 A WEEK, UH, THEY DON'T--THEY DON'T FIND IT POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT. IT'S TRUE. UH, WHEN |--UH, WHEN I SEE WHAT THINGS COST NOWADAYS, LIKE A HAMBURGER. A HAMBURGER COSTING 80 CENTS SOUNDS LIKE APIECE OF INSANITY TO ME. EVERYBODY KNOWS A HAMBURGER COSTS A DIME. UH, THAT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE, EXCEPT IT DOESN'T. HA HA HA! BUT |T—-|T'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE. IT WAS CERTAINLY MUCH SIMPLER WITHOUT THE COMMUNICATIONS WE HAVE TODAY, LET ALONE, MOVIES AND TELEVISION. UH, MANY PEOPLE SPENT THEIR ENTIRE LIVES NOT BEING 50 OR 100 MILES FROM HOME. UH, BUT THEY HAD A—-THEY GAINED THINGS. THEY WEREN'T TORN ON THE BIAS THE WAY WE ARE. THEY WEREN'T PULLED AT FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. I GUESS EVERY GAIN WE'VE MADE WE'VE PAID A PRETTY HEAVY COST FOR. WHAT--WHAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE COUNTRY DIDN'T BELIEVE BEFORE THE WAR BUT BELIEVED AFTER IN TERMS OF CHANGE? DO--DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? WHAT DID THE WAR-- YES. UH...|'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THAT. THEY HAD A THEORETICAL NOTION OF HAVING A COUNTRY, BUT WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER, ON BOTH SIDES, THEY KNEW THEY'D HAD A COUNTRY. THEY HAD BEEN THERE. THEY--THEY HAD WALKED ITS HILLS AND TRAMPED ITS ROADS. UH, THEY--THEY SAW THE COUNTRY, AND THEY KNEW THEY HAD A COUNTRY. AND THEY KNEW--THE-- THE EFFORT THAT THEY HAD EXPENDED AND THEIR DEAD FRIENDS HAD EXPENDED TO PRESERVE IT. UH, |T--|T DID THAT. |T--|T--|T MADE THEIR COUNTRY AN ACTUALITY. WHAT DID THE WAR DO THAT WAS GOOD? YOU KNOW, WHAT WERE THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAME FROM IT? WARS ALWAYS BRING INVENTIONS THAT ARE EXTREMELY USEFUL. I CAN NAME SOME OF THEM THAT SEEM FAIRLY SMALL BUT HAD A BIG IMPORTANCE. THE FOUNTAIN PEN, FOR INSTANCE, WAS INVENTED DURING THE CIVIL WAR. THE MACHINE THAT STITCHES THE SOLES OF SHOES TO UPPERS WAS INVENTED DURING THE CIVIL WAR. THAT MEANS ONE MAN WORKING IN A DAY COULD MAKE 80 PAIRS OF SHOES, WHERE A MAN PREVIOUSLY WOULD TAKE TWO DAYS TO MAKE A PAIR OF SHOES. UH, ALL THOSE THINGS CONTRIBUTED LARGELY TO IT. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WERE NOT ONLY WAR INVENTIONS. THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF INVENTIONS, UH, GOING ON. UH, THE WAR SAW THE FOUNDING OF A NUMBER OF, UH, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS-- VMI, VASSAR. THESE WERE ALL CREATED RIGHT DURING THE WAR. IT'S ONE OF MY BIG POINTS THAT I POINT TO IN POINTING THAT, UH, THE NORTH FOUGHT THAT WAR WITH ONLY PART OF ITS EFFORTS. IF IT WAS ABLE TO DO ALL THESE OTHER THINGS, INCLUDING THE HOMESTEAD ACT, UM, NO TELLING WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE DONE TO THE SOUTH IF IT HAD CONCENTRATED ON REALLY FIGHTING THAT WAR, THE WAY THE SOUTH HAD TO DO. IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S ACERTAIN AMOUNT OF "CULTURAL ADRENALIN" THAT WAS PRODUCED BY THE WAR, YOU KNOW. IT'S WHEN PEOPLE STARTED GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. WELL, YOU'VE GOT-- THE CIVIL WAR, | MAINTAIN, IS OUR "ILIAD." UH, IT IS OUR GREAT STORY FOR THE-- OUT OF THE PAST, AND IT DEFINES US IN OUR OWN MINDS AND IN ANYBODY'S THAT'S READING THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. IT IS A FAR MORE CHARACTER-DEFINING THING THAN THE REVOLUTION, FOR INSTANCE, WHERE ALL THE PRINCIPLES OF OUR GOVERNMENT WERE ESTABLISHED, BUT THE CIVIL WAR ESTABLISHED OUR NATURE, UH, OUR--OUR BEING. AND THAT'S GOOD AND BAD. THE VIOLENCE OF IT IS THE--THE UNDERSIDE OF AMERICAN CHARACTER, BUT THE NOBILITY OF IT IS THE BEST SIDE OF--OF OUR CHARACTER, AND THEY ARE BOTH THERE. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE NAMES FOR THE CIVIL WAR THAT PEOPLE GAVE TO IT? I MEAN, WE CALL IT THE CIVIL WAR, BUT THERE'S AN ENDLESS LIST. WELL, THE--THE OFFICIAL, UH--| BELIEVE, OFFICIAL NORTHERN NAME FOR IT IS THE WAR OF THE REBELLION, WHICH--WH|CH IS ANATHEMA TO SOUTHERN EARS. UH, SOUTHERNERS USUALLY PREFER TO CALL IT THE WAR BETWEEN THE STATES. SOME PEOPLE CALL IT THE LATE UNPLEASANTNESS. I THINK MARK TWAIN CALLED IT THE LATE UNPLEASANTNESS. JOE JOHNSTON HAD A NAME FOR IT. HE CALLED IT THE WAR AGAINST THE STATES. SO THERE WERE LOTS OF NAMES FOR IT. CUT. THAT WAS A RUN-OUT. I DON'T THINK SO. MAN: MARCH 28, 1987, AMERICAN DOCUMENTARIES, PROJECT TITLE "CIVIL WAR," CONTINUATION OF INTERVIEW WITH SHELBY FOOTE, CAMERA ROLL 181, SOUND ROLL 39, RECORDED FLAT 7 1/2 IPS, -8 DB REFERENCE TONE TO FOLLOW. SO WE'LL HAVE A TOTAL OF-- SOUND'S ROLLING, SPEED. SLATE. DO YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR IMAGE FROM THE WAR? CAN YOU DESCRIBE IT? THERE'S A PHOTOGRAPH |--|'M VERY FOND OF. IT SHOWS 3 CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS WHO WERE CAPTURED AT GETTYSBURG, AND THEY ARE POSED IN FRONT OF OR ALONGSIDE ASNAKE-RAIL FENCE, AND YOU SEE EXACTLY HOW THE CONFEDERATE SOLDIER WAS DRESSED. YOU SEE SOMETHING IN HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CAMERA THAT'S REVEALING OF HIS NATURE, AND ONE OF THEM HAS HIS, UH,ARMS LIKE THIS, UH, AS IF HE'S HAVING HIS PICTURE MADE, BUT HE'S DETERMINED TO BE THE INDIVIDUAL HE IS, AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT PICTURE THAT DRAWS ME STRONGLY AS AN IMAGE OF THE WAR. WHAT UNIFORM, CONFEDERATE UNIFORM, WOULD YOU WEAR IF YOU COULD WEAR IT? THERE SEEMS SUCH A PROLIFERATION OF UNIFORMS. WHAT WOULD YOU WEAR? WHAT DO YOU LIKE? WELL, UH, THE DRESS UNIFORM IS THE HANDSOMEST, WITH AN ARTILLERY SASH AROUND YOUR WAIST, WHICH, OF COURSE, WOULD BE RED, AND, UH, ASABER, AND A--A WIDE-BRIMMED HAT, AND A HIGH COLLAR, UH, WITH YOUR RANK ON--ON THE COLLAR. UH, THAT'S PROBABLY THE HANDSOMEST ONE. WHO FILLED OUT THAT UNIFORM IN THE SOUTHERN ARMY THE BEST, TO YOUR MIND? ROBERT E. LEE LOOKS MIGHTY GOOD. UH, THEY ALL LOOKED GOOD, THOUGH. IT WAS A HANDSOME UNIFORM. |--| THINK THAT THE CONFEDERATE UNIFORM WAS A—-A VERY HANDSOME UNIFORM, AND I LIKE ITS SORT OF MODESTY ABOUT RANK. UH, YOU COULDN'T TELL A BRIGADIER FROM A-- FROM A FULL GENERAL. THEY ALL WORE THREE STARS WITH A WREATH AROUND THEM. UH, AND THERE'S SOMETHING QUIET ABOUT IT, LIKE FRENCH ARMY UNIFORMS. THE RANK WAS NOT ASSERTIVE. THEY DIDN'T HAVE BARS ON THEIR SHOULDERS OR ANY OF THAT. IT WAS A—-A SIMPLE COLLAR ORNAMENT, THE WAY WE WEAR NOW. WHY DID DISEASE KILL THREE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE AS THE WAR? THEY NOT ONLY DIDN'T SUBSCRIBE TO THE GERM THEORY, THEY DIDN'T SUSPECT |T-- OR SUSPECT THAT IT EXISTED. THAT'S ONE BIG REASON. UH, BLOOD POISONING, ERYSIPELAS, UH, PNEUMONIA, EVEN MEASLES WAS A BIG KILLER. UH, THOSE THINGS, THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO TREAT THEM, LET ALONE NOT HAVE ANY PENICILLIN. UH, AND IT WAS JUSTAQUESTION OF A CRISIS AND SURVIVAL, OR A CRISIS AND DYING. UH, IT'S A WONDER THEY DID AS WELL AS THEY DID. WOULD DISEASE JUST RIP RIGHT THROUGH A CAMP? THEY HAD EPIDEMICS OF WHOOPING COUGH AND, UH, VARIOUS THINGS. UH, I JUST MENTIONED MEASLES. THAT CAME AS A GREAT SURPRISE TO ME, HOW MANY SOLDIERS DIED OF MEASLES. I DIDN'T KNOW A PERSON COULD DIE OF MEASLES, BUT THEY DID IN LARGE NUMBERS. AND, UH, IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE WAR, ESPECIALLYA CAMP, WHETHER NORTHERN OR SOUTHERN, WAS AN UPROARIOUS THING WITH THE COUGHING. THERE WASATREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COUGHING, UH, IN THE CAMPS IN THE EARLY DAYS. THEY ALL SHOOK DOWN. YOU COULDN'T TELL A CITY BOY FROM A COUNTRY BOY AFTER HE HAD BEEN IN THE ARMY AYEAR OR 80... THE SAME WAY |N--TODAY. WHO ARE THE REAL JERKS OR FRAUDS OF THAT WAR? IT MUST HAVE PRODUCED SOME REAL HORSE'S ASSES. UH, YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DEFINE MY PREJUDICES, UH, WHICH I CAN DO. THERE ARE PEOPLE I JUST DON'T LIKE PERSONALLY... PHIL SHERIDAN IS ONE OF THEM. HOW MUCH THAT'S BECAUSE HE DESPISED SOUTHERNERS, I'M NOT TOO SURE. BUT I NEVER DID LIKE SMALL MEN WHO BRISTLE ALL THE TIME. UH, ANOTHER ONE THAT I HAVE SOME RESENTMENT FOR IS A CONFEDERATE, JOE JOHNSTON, ONE OF THE GREAT CONFEDERATE GENERALS AND VERY MUCH LOVED BY HIS MEN. SO WHAT--WHAT I FEEL FOR BOTH THOSE MEN IS JUST SHEER PREJUDICE. UH, WE--WE--THEY RUB ME THE WRONG WAY, OR WE FAIL TO HOOK ATOMS. AND WHEN YOU'RE AWARE OF THOSE THINGS, IT MAKES YOU LEAN OVER BACKWARDS TO BE FAIR TO THOSE PEOPLE WHOM YOU DISLIKE. I HOPE THAT I DID, BUT I'M SURE |--| WASN'T ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL. WHAT'S THE STORY, QUICKLY, ABOUT GREELEY'S HANDWRITING? UH, I THINK THAT'S A POSTWAR STORY. BUT ANYHOW, HORACE GREELEY IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE HAD THE MOST INDECIPHERABLE HANDWRITING IN THE WORLD. 80 AS A JOKE--AND PEOPLE IN NEWSPAPER OFFICES FREQUENTLY PLAY JOKES-- THEY GOTACHICKEN, DIPPED ITS FEET IN INK, TOOK A PIECE OF PAPER, AND WALKED IT ACROSS THE INK, FILLING THE WHOLE PAGE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM, AND, UH, PUT IT ON THE HOOK FOR THE LINOTYPE OPERATOR TO SET. GREELEY HAD ONLY ONE MAN BACK THERE, A LINOTYPE OPERATOR WHO COULD READ HIS WRITING. AND THERE WAS-- UH, GREELEY CAME IN AND SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR. AND AFTER A WHILE, THE LINOTYPE OPERATOR APPEARED AND SAID, UH, "MR. GREELEY, "I THINK I'VE GOT IT ALL EXCEPT THIS WORD. IS THAT 'CONSTITUTIONALITY?"' CHUCKLES I'M NOT SURE THAT STORY IS TRUE, IF IT... DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE SONG FROM THE CIVIL WAR THAT YOU LIKE THAT YOU COULD SING A FEW BARS FOR US? I'VE ASKED EVERYBODY TO SING... ICERTAINLY COULDN'T SING A FEW BARS, BUT |--| LIKE "THE BONNY BLUE FLAG." UH, I LIKE A LOT OF THE SOUTHERN SONGS THAT HAVE A SORT OF COWBOY TWANG TO THEM. THEY ARE SORT OF BANJO SONGS LIKE "THE YELLOW ROSE OF TEXAS." UH, THOSE SONGS I LIKE. I LIKE A SENTIMENTAL BALLAD THAT CAME FROM WELL BEFORE THE WAR CALLED "LORENA." AND I THINK IF ANYONE WERE TO SING THAT SONG WELL TODAY, THERE'D BE A GREAT REVIVAL OF IT. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO ADD, SHELBY, BEFORE YOU READ THAT WE SHOULD REMEMBER TO TAKE WITH US AGAIN ABOUT THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT? NO. TH|S--TH|S THING I HAVE TO READ WILL COVER THAT, UH, |F--|F IT DOES. GOOD. LET'S CUT, THEN. MAN: SOUND'S ROLLING, SPEED. SLATE. HOLD IT, PLEASE. WAIT FOR ME. AND...OK. BURNS: OK, SHELBY.
