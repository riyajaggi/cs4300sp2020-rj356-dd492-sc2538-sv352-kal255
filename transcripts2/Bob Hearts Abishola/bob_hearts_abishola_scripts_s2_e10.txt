 Previously, on "Bob Hearts Abishola"... Your husband is coming to America. What? That's a nice dress. Tayo will like it. It's not for him. I just grabbed any old thing from the closet. Well, your old thing has a tag from Nordstrom's. I do not want him to come here. Ah-ah, a father must see his son. Would you rather they eat at the Home of the Whopper? E kaabo, Dad.

 and I will decide what is next. Thank you, Mum. That's wonderful. Hey. - Look who I ran into in the hallway. - Kaale, Abishola. Kaale. Come in. - After you. - I insist. - No, really. - Oh, but I couldn't. Just come inside. I have to go and check on dinner. This is a surprise. I didn't see you in the elevator. Why take an elevator when it is only three floors? Well, if you read the sign, it says in case of emergency, use the stairs. Dele, the game is starting. Hey, Dele. Kaale, Bob. Kaale, Dad. Watching a little soccer, huh? - Football. - No, it's not. You're welcome to watch with us. Uh, no, thanks. I'm not a big fútbol guy. Perhaps you don't understand the subtleties of the game. Oh, I understand. It's just the most boring thing I've ever seen. You're talking to a guy who makes socks for a living. Bob. I should go help. Yes. The kitchen is a better place for you. Yeah, that's where the knives are. How come you didn't tell me he was coming over? Uh-uh. I said Tayo will be watching the game with Dele. I didn't know you meant here. Where did you think I meant? I don't know, a sports bar? My son is not going to a bar. No, no, a bar is full of drunks. A sports bar has drunks and their kids. We are making dinner here. Right. Sundays are pork chops and Tayo. A boy should spend time with his father. That almost sounded like you meant it. Are you doing all right with all this? I'm fine. You sure? You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. I mean, I'm not good with this stuff, either. What stuff? You know, emotional stuff. You're right. You're not good at it. But I'm fine. Okay. But are you? 'Cause sometimes I say I'm fine when I'm, you know, not fine. - Bob. - Got it. I'm fine, too. Good. See, this is one of those times where I said I'm fine, but I'm not fine. Chop tomatoes or go and watch football. There's more action with the tomatoes. "Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola playing...

My potato salad should receive a Michelin star. They don't review hospital cafeterias. Well, they should. Good food is good food. The best meal I ever ate was in a Turkish prison. Why were you in a Turkish prison? I didn't have to disclose that to get this job, and I don't have to disclose it now. Tayo wants to pick Dele up from school. Yeah, he could not get the lioness, and now he's set his sights on the cub. Mm. He just wants to spend time with him. Oh, yeah, being the fun dad while you get stuck being the bad cop. The bad cop? Yeah. You know, the one telling him to clean his room, do his homework, punishing him. That sounds like a good cop to me. Oh, that poor cub. I hate to say it, but it's easier when the husband is dead. You don't hate to say it. You say that all the time. Yes, but you have to say you hate to say it. You shouldn't say it at all. Why not? It's a fact. You don't have to deal with a messy divorce. And you never have to see them on the arm of another woman. And sometimes you can get a little money. And he's not there - to tell you how to spend it. - Mm-hmm. I'm gonna admit it does sound pretty good. You hate to say it. Oh, yeah. I-I hate to say it. ♪ You want me, I want you, baby ♪ ♪ My sugarboo, I'm levitating ♪ ♪ The Milky Way... ♪ You guys ready? All right, five, six, seven, eight. ♪ I got you, moonlight ♪ - ♪ You're my starlight, I need you ♪ - ♪ You ♪ ♪ All night, come on, dance with me ♪ ♪ I'm levitating ♪ ♪ You, moonlight ♪ ♪ You're my starlight ♪ ♪ I need you all night ♪ ♪ Come on, dance with me ♪ ♪ I'm levitating. ♪ Okay, that was really good. As soon as Mark figures out the routine isn't all about him, it'll be perfect. Everyone take a break and, uh, we'll run it through one more time. - Dele. - Oh, uh, that's my dad. We're done for the day. I'll see you guys later. See you later. - See ya! - Bye. When your mother said you had practice, I was expecting a sport. Basketball, football. Not this cheerleading nonsense. It's not cheerleading. It's a dance group that I started. Oh, so you are the cheerleader leader? Choreographer. What? Speak up, now. Or are you as embarrassed by this as I am? You need to pick a career that will give you a good life. There is no future with this dancing business. I'm still going to be a doctor. I'm just doing this for fun. Not anymore. It is unmanly. Yes, Dad. You will stop this nonsense. One day, you will understand and thank me. Yes, Dad. And don't worry. This is not your fault. I blame your mother. Come in. - You wanted to see us? - Yeah. Why do people think this is good? You mean soccer? And you mean 80% of the world's population? Help me out here. I'm trying to enjoy it, but nothing's happening. Oh, it would be an honor to use company time to help you appreciate this beautiful game. - Oh! - Oh! Oh. Why was that exciting? He was offside. - Okay. - Which means the teammate he was passing to was a little ahead of the backmost defender. And that's exciting? No. But it is almost exciting. The beauty of football is, everything has to go just right for success to be achieved. It is like the old ketchup commercial. Do you remember? ♪ Anticipation ♪ - ♪ Anticipation, it's ♪ - ♪ Anticipation, it's ♪ ♪ Making me wait. ♪ The ketchup tastes better - because you have to wait for it. - I never waited. I just always shoved a butter knife up there. Ah, yes. Americans have no patience for anything. Except iPhones. They're happy to wait in line for iPhones. Mr. Wheeler, you're a good businessman because you see a problem and you go right at it. But there are times where that strategy will not work. Football, women and ketchup. These are things you must be patient with. What do you know about women? For your information, in the city of Detroit, - my accent is very sexy. - Hmm. Ooh! Ooh! Why is everybody getting worked up? The guy just tripped. Because the other man just touched his ankle, so now he's getting a yellow card. Does it say "get well soon"? No. It's a warning. If it occurs again, he'll be shown a red card. Oh, what's next? He gets put in time-out? Yes. Now what? There is a beach ball in the stands. Get out of here. Kaale, Auntie. Kaale, Uncle. There is something wrong with your son. Uh-uh. Is he sick? No. He is mopey. We did what we could. I yelled at him. Olu had him clean the bathroom. There is nothing more we can do. Kaale, Mom. Huh. What's wrong? Nothing. Okay. But be un-mopey by dinner. I decided to stop dancing. Because it is ridiculous. Because Dad told me to. I see. And, uh... How do you... ...feel? I feel like I should stop dancing. Good. That's the correct feeling. But, uh... do you feel other... ...feelings? Excuse me? Don't make me ask you again. I'm... I'm not happy about it. That's what I thought. See you later. Are you hungry? No. Okay. Chili ready? Not yet. Needs time for the flavor to build. Well, better hurry. The Sun is gonna set in 17 minutes. So what? I'm intermittent fasting. I'm only eating sunup until sundown. Oh, maybe I'll try that with drinking. I think that's called intermittent alcoholism. You can't rush chili. You got to be patient. Oh, my God. Soccer is chili. Hey, what's up? I need your help with feelings. Oh. Uh, okay, yeah. You said I could come to you. Of course. I'm here. I'm putting on my emotional support hat. You need a hat for this? No, I just... What happened? Dele's upset because his father made him stop dancing, and I didn't know who else to call. All right. Well, let's talk it through. - That's what partners do. - Thank you, Bob. So, Tayo's starting to influence Dele. Is that weird for you? Why does that matter? I thought you wanted to talk about your feelings. No, I don't want to talk about my feelings. I want you to talk to Dele about his feelings. Oh. Uh, okay. But how are you doing with it? Will you stop with this nonsense and come and help? - Now? - Yes, now. My son is having feelings. I'll get my hat. My real hat. I'm going over to Abishola's. The chili's not very good, Bob. It's a bit off. Next time, maybe let it cook a little longer. Speaks Yoruba... Tell Bob about your feelings. Knock, knock. - What are you doing? - It's his room. It is my room. I just allow him to sleep in it. What's going on? Bob is here to take away your unhappiness. Hey, buddy. How you doing? Good. You see? He says he's good, but look at his face. That is not a good face. Why don't you just give us a minute? Fine. Just because you're unhappy does not mean you have to be dirty. She's worried about you. I know. She never does my laundry. - Who does? - I do. Right. Nigerian. Look, we don't have to talk about anything you don't want to talk about. I'm just checking in. I'm fine. You're fine. Well, when you're looking for a hobby to replace dancing, don't pick poker. She's glad I'm not dancing. She's just angry I'm quitting because of my dad. Why are you quitting? You love dancing. When has that ever mattered? That's all that matters. Look, at the end of the day, it's your life. Not your mom's. Not your dad's. So what do you want to do? I want to keep dancing. I thought so. I'm intuitive that way. Very in touch with my feelings. Thanks, Bob. Oh, and by the way, I agree with you about soccer. - Really? - It's so boring. Okay, honestly, this is the best conversation I've ever had. Kaasan, Tayo. Kaasan, Abishola. We need to talk. Yes, we do. Yesterday, I saw my son climbing a human pyramid. He looked like a cherry on top of a sundae. This is what you want, this dancing? Of course not. It is nonsense. Okay, then what is the problem? It should be his choice. I know how stupid that sounds. But he's a good boy, and I trust him. And I know how stupid that sounds. And what I'm about to say next will sound even more stupid. I want my son to be happy. So, to make him happy, you'll just let him do whatever he likes? If doing whatever he likes means working hard, getting straight As, and doing this stupid dance thing on the side, then yes. You both have become too American. Oh. Because that is where you dragged us and it is where you left us. Dele is my son. That is true. But do not forget, I am the one raising him. Mummy, lift the screen. Is that better? Much better. That is a lovely dress. Thank you. It is new. Dry-clean only. Very nice. That reminds me, I could use a new steamer. I will send you a photo of the one I want. For your birthday? - For Dele to bring. - What are you talking about? When he comes to visit Nigeria with his father. He's not going to Nigeria. I believe a ticket has been bought. Nobody talked to me about this. Well, Tayo talked to me. - It is not his decision. - Hey, hey. You don't want Dele to come see his own grandmother? You want a stranger to bring my steamer? I have to go, Mummy. - Abishola, wait. - Yes. Your hair looks terrible today. Uh-huh, we need to talk to you. He is a teenage boy. Knocking is best for everybody. Your father wants to take you to Nigeria. Yes, he told me. He cannot force you to do anything you don't want to do. Because... Because it is your choice. And... You want Dele to be happy. You do? Of course I do. Didn't you hear what he just said? You were doing so good. Don't worry. I will tell your father that you do not want to go. But I do. What? I want to go with my dad. But he will not let you dance. He will not let you do anything that makes you happy. Because he doesn't know me. But if I go, he can learn more about me and my dancing and everything else that's important to me. Is that what he told you? Yes. He wants us to get to know each other. And I'd like to meet the rest of my family. The rest of his family. I'll see Granny Ebun, too. Please, Mum. It's only for the summer. This is really what you want? Yes, Mum. I see. You did great. I'm so glad he feels he can be honest with you. Oh, come here. Bob. Why do we have to watch this American football? Bob made an effort to take an interest in our sport. The least we can do is become his football buddies. But there's no flow to the game, huh? Just five seconds of men trying to kill each other, then a commercial where a dog brings a man a beer. Oh. It is very violent. And I have slaughtered many goats. Perhaps we are too sophisticated for this barbaric game. Ah, ah, ah. That player. Look at his name. Ogbah. He's Nigerian. And he's chasing the man with the ball. Get him, Ogbah! - Kill him! - Smash his head! Ogbah! - Ogbah! Ogbah! - Ogbah! - Ogbah! - Ogbah!
