 You should have been more careful. Do you want to go for food? Let's go. Come to your senses, Hong Seol. You can't let that smile fool you. -Mad Hair. -Are you out of your mind? -That's such a great idea. -I know, right? Gosh, she's sleeping deeply. -Wake up, Seol! Seol. -Wake up. Get up now. Open your eyes. -She's totally asleep. -Hey! -Goodness. -Just leave me alone. I'm tired.

 -I'm tired. I'm exhausted. -Here. Drink this. -Drink this. -Because of you... Gosh, seriously. Drink this and wake up. -Hey! No more alcohol for you. -Stop her. We're going to move to a different place. Wake up now. I'm gonna take time off from school. I'll do that, too. -What are you talking about? -Taking time off from school. -Goodness. She needs to go home. -What's wrong with her? She's acting really strange today. -Gosh, Seol. -We should take her home. -We'll take you home, Seol. -I won't go. I won't! I'm taking time off from school.

 -I'm really gonna do it. -I'll take time off from school, too. -I'm doing it. -Why is she like this today? Seol, stop it now. -Get up now. Let's go home. -Let's go home. -Get up, okay? -Get up. -Please? -Get up now, Seol. Get up. Get up now. I got up! Where did he go? Where is he? Where did he disappear to? -Where... -Seol. -Where did he go? -Gosh, come on. -Seol! -Is she okay? -Gosh, that must hurt. -Goodness. She must be in pain. He's here. I see him right here! It's all because of you. Fine. I'll disappear from your life. Will that make you happy? I decided to take time off from school because... ONE YEAR AGO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER PARTY What are you doing? Stop it. -Seol! -Gosh, it's you! -Hi. -It's Hong Seol! -Hi. -Hong Seol. Hi. Welcome back, Seol. Doesn't it feel great to be back to school -after working for a year? -Have are you? I'm just happy to see you again. Let me pour you a drink. -Is he Eun-taek? -Yes. No need to know his name. He's just my servant. I'm jealous. You have a servant now. He can be your servant too. Right, Eun-taek? -To our servant, cheers. -Cheers! I'm not sure how I feel about this. The lettuce is ready. I'll add the meat as well as ssamjang. I'll put in plenty of it. Then I'll add garlic. -Don't make eye contact with him. -Finally, I'll pour soju as a finishing touch. Ha Jae-u. -I don't wanna eat that. -Why not? It's not dirty. Just try it. Stop it! How many times do I have to tell you I don't want it? Drop it, okay? -Why are they fighting? -Not everyone gets to taste my soju wrap! -Don't look at him. -Hong Seol. -Hide. -What do we do? Seol. We should celebrate your return to school. Let's liven up this party a bit. -Just leave her alone. -Come on. Get up now. -Who would want to eat that? -I can't drink... -Get up and try it. -Sang-cheol, why would you do that? -Stop it. -It's for people who can't drink. -Grab it. -Gosh. -Water is dripping. Eat it quickly. -Seol, just eat it. -Just eat it. -All right. Go, Hong Seol! -Go, Hong Seol! -No, don't eat it. -Don't keep me waiting forever -Stop it, seriously. I really hate these things. Drink up, drink up! -Drink up, we're waiting. -She's eating it. -Gosh, stop it! -Goodness. -Yes! -She did it! Seol, welcome back to school. Hi, Jeong. You made it. -Jeong! Come here. -You okay? -Come this way. -Come and sit with us. -Move. Get out. -Goodness! Look at this mess. What should we do? Attention, everyone. He recently finished serving in the army and came back to school. His name is You Jeong. Applause. -Let's welcome him with applause! -You heard a lot about him, no? I haven't seen him in a while, but he's still so good-looking. But he looks a little cold. What are you talking about? He's perfection. Don't you agree, Servant? Well, sure. But he's way too perfect to be my type. I'm attracted to men who are not so perfect. I'm not so perfect. Let me feed you. Here. Watch now. Da-yeong and Ju-yeon will be all over him and try to win his heart. Jeong, I'll make a lettuce wrap for you. -Yes, thanks. -Jeong. -Look. Look at Ju-yeon. -Do you remember me? Have you two met before? Well, I met you once as soon as I got into school, -but you joined the army after that. -Is that right? -Your name is... -I'm Nam Ju-yeon. -I'm happy to meet you again. -Likewise. The table is messy. Shall we get these cleared up and order more? -No, it's okay. I already ate. -No, no. Let's order more dishes. -It's really okay. -Do you like cockles? Pancakes? What do you like? Jeong doesn't eat those things. You don't even know what to order. I see it right there. Seasoned skate. Order something else. That dish is expensive. Shut it. Jeong loves seasoned skate! He's the one who wants to eat it. He's just using Jeong. Jeong, let me pour you a drink. -It's okay. I'll do it. -I'll pour you a drink. -Don't worry. I can do it. -No, I want to. -No, it's okay. -No, let me do it... -Goodness! -Are you okay? Give her some tissues. Pass them to her. -Are you okay? -Jeong, take these tissues. -My socks are soaked. -Go and dry your clothes. It looks like he did it on purpose. -Are you okay? -Yes, I'm fine. Wipe this here. I see a smile on his face. So he did it on purpose. Where are you going? -You told me to wipe it. -I already did it. What was that about? It's creeping me out. Oh, hi. Seol, you were there. Yes. What are you doing here? I'm just counting the membership fee we collected today. Do they have to make me do this when I'm much older than you? Sang-cheol, let's go for another round of drinks. -We have enough money, right? -Not at all. We've used it all up. Everyone has to put in extra 20,000 won. What? What are you talking about? No one would want to go then. Jeong is here. What are you so worried about? -Today was his first day back. -You know his family's rich. He's very generous too. Seol. You're coming too, right? -No, I'll get going. -Why not? We'll treat you! Goodness. -You're gonna get the bill then? -Why should I get the bill? We have Jeong. Goodness. Stop being a leech. Look, Jeong hasn't seen us in a long time. He'll treat. -That moment. -He loves buying food and drinks for us. I shouldn't have run into him. That's how it all began. Hong Seol. Hong Seol! It's you, isn't it? You're the one who posted on the message board that I stole money from the membership fee! I don't know what you're talking about. Look. Can you really say that you didn't do this? Can you? Goodness. You're such a great actor. Look at you with your poker face. Because of this, I had to meet with the executive board, and they interrogated me about last year's fees, too. No, I didn't do it. -Stop lying to my face. -Do you have proof? You should stay out of this. You're the only one who saw me counting the money on the staircase that day. I wasn't the only one. There was someone else. Who? Tell me. Who else was there? -That smirk. -Gyeong-hwan? He was in the restroom. You're the only one. It's you. You did it. -You! It's you. -Calm down first, okay? -How could you stab me in the back? -Sang-cheol. Regardless of who wrote that post, it's not that person's fault. -What? -Let's talk about it later, okay? Gosh, I'm so angry. I won't forgive you, Seol. Goodness, that stupid jerk. He's really unbelievable. Seol, I think you did the right thing. I'll talk to Sang-cheol about it. Are you serious right now? Do you really think that I did it? You were there too, under the staircase. -What are you saying? -I know you saw everything. I didn't do it. So who could it be? How dare you. You're accusing him of writing the post about Sang-cheol? Do you know what he had to go through to resolve the situation? He met each executive board member who was threatening to sue. -He even paid them back. -That's enough. Seol, so are you saying that Jeong stabbed Sang-cheol in the back then pretended to help him? -You're getting creative. -You really didn't do it? -I shouldn't have asked him. -Jeong, let's go. Behind that smirk or smile of his, he hides his scary side and two-facedness, which I didn't really know back then. Thank you. Hello... -I'd like two Americanos. -Sure. They'll be ready shortly. Seol. Have you apologized to Jeong yet? You didn't even say hi to him properly earlier. Jeong isn't saying anything because he's so forgiving. If it were me, I would've taught you a lesson. -What are you trying to tell me? -Be thankful. Hi, Seol. What's wrong with him? Yes, hello. Jeong, we'll be late for our class. Let's go now. Okay. Hold on. Seol, I think you drink too much coffee. -Drink something healthier. -Pardon me? He totally blanked me earlier. Why is he acting like this all of a sudden? I'll see you around. It looks like you were dying to make him notice you. Are you happy now? What? Did he talk to me and act all friendly on purpose? Did he put on an act for Ju-yeon to see? Class is about to start. Where is she? What are you doing this weekend? -Fallen head over heels for Jeong, -I'll do my assignment. -Ju-yeon started picking on me. -Can I join? I'm going to work on it at home. Yes. What are you doing now? Were you sleeping? -Are you gonna skip class? -It's only 10:00 a.m. now. Seol, class starts at 10:00 a.m. Wake up! What about your attendance mark and the quiz? Don't you know you can't retake this quiz? Ju-yeon said the class got rescheduled to 1:00 p.m. What? Ju-yeon said that to you? Listen. This'll be a three-hour class, so hurry over now, okay? Goodness. What is going on? Look, Nam Ju-yeon. Did you tell Seol this class got rescheduled? Right, I'm sorry. I got confused and gave her the wrong information. How can she pick on Seol like this as a student representative? -I'm gonna pull her hair out. -Stop it. Calm down. Leave it. It'd just make you look crazy. - Calm down now. -What should I do? Seol won't be here for another 20 minutes, even if she runs. Gosh, why isn't the professor here yet? I should try calling. Go and wait in front of the door. Stall the professor for an hour. Goodness. Stop talking nonsense. I'll give you a kiss on your cheek. What should I do? -Gosh, what am I gonna do? -Do you think I'm a joke? If she gets here in 20 minutes... What's wrong with this door? Why's Mr. Heo here? The professor is in the emergency room due to sudden stomach pain -and may not be able to come today. -Yes! Has she lost her mind? I'm going to check attendance now. After that, -there will be a quiz. -You can't do that. -No way. -I'm authorized to do this. The class is canceled. Why bother with the attendance? Plus, the professor isn't here, so you can't give us a quiz. I'm just doing what the professor told me to do. By the way, why are you trying to order me around? Who are you? -Who do you think you are? -I'm sorry. -Bo-ra. I'll be back. -Kang Hyeon-su. -Wait a little bit, okay? -Where are you going? Are you going to the washroom in the middle of class? -Jang Yeong-ju. -Gosh, I'm sorry. I walked here because I had no money for bus fare. -Come in and have a seat. -Thank you. Mr. Heo, I love you! -Let go of this! -What are you doing now? -Bring it back here. -I'm sorry. This is mine now! What are you talking about? Give it back to me! Stop and give it back to me, okay? -Give it back! -It's mine! No, Seol. Not this way. You, little rat. Bring it back. Gosh, this is ridiculous! Give it back now! Give it back. Mr. Heo. -I love you. -Goodness, this little rat. You love me? You're crazy. You, idiot. -What? What do you want from me? -That's enough. -That's enough? What's enough? -It hurts. Mr. Heo, please forgive me. -Then why'd you take it? -Please. -Goodness, this rat. -You know I love you, right? I don't want your love. I'm gonna teach you a lesson today. -Seol! -Yes! I'm so happy you made it in time. Get this, the professor isn't here today. Mr. Heo came instead. Then Eun-taek ran away with the attendance sheet. Yes. I saw Eun-taek. Really? Where did you see him? -I'm really sorry. -Go in and sit down. -Just go and sit. Hurry up. -I apologize again. -I'm sorry. -Why did he run away with it? Look at you. That was pretty impressive. He usually never apologizes. Why in the world did he run away with this? Mind your manners even when the professor isn't around. All right. I'll check the attendance again. -Kang Seong-beom. -Here. Ko Hyo-jin. -After the incident at the party, -Lee Ga-ram. Jeong started using other people in a sly manner -to pick on me non-stop. -Kim Jeong-ryeol. Goodness. Should've been more careful. That moment, I could really feel it. I clearly felt his malicious intent toward me. My school life turned into hell because of him, and that's why I decided to take time off from school. You look so tired. I'm glad to see you alive though. You should've called in sick. I have to get back to work now. Do you remember mentioning taking time off from school while drunk? -What? -I knew you wouldn't remember. I must've gone crazy. Here. Take this. They say that sharing is caring. Use it to pay your tuition fees. You're crazy. You've been saving for a year to go backpacking. That's not true. It's been ten months, not a year. -I can't accept this. -Just take it. You shouldn't take time off from school. If you take a break now, how old will you be when you graduate? Age matters for women. -I really can't accept this. -Just take it, okay? I really wanna go to school together with you. -Gosh, I do too! -Then take this. It's not because of money. It must be because of money. Who's calling now? Hi, Eun-taek. What's up? What? What did you say? Wow, that's so amazing. Okay, thanks for letting me know. Talk to you later. What did Eun-taek say? Why? Did something good happen to him? -Should I tell you or not? -Tell me! You got a full scholarship. -What? -Hong Seol. You're getting a full scholarship! How is something like this possible? With my part-time job, I must work for a year to earn this amount. Is the universe telling me not to take time off? I really don't want to see him at school, though. -Seol! -Seol. -Let's walk fast. -Why? Why? Why are we walking fast? Run! Seol, why are you running? We have plenty of time! -Why are we running right now? -Look behind you. -We need to save seats. -Right, in the computer room. Run. Gosh, let's go a little slower! -We have to get there fast. -Do you want to ruin the semester? -Run! -My friend, wait for me. -Run faster! -Run, Bo-ra. Look behind you. -I'll meet you guys there. -Come on, Bo-ra! -I feel like I'll trip and fall! -Wait for me! Wait for me. I'm so exhausted. I can't even see what's on the monitor. -Just turn on the computer first. -Okay. We have to get into Professor Han's class. Put it as your first choice. It has to be the first choice. We can't be bumped to Professor Kang's class. -Is your satellite clock on? -Yes, I turned it on. It can't be off even by a second. We have to click the button at 9:00 a.m. sharp. Our semester depends on the index finger. Let's get ready now. Okay. -Click now! -Faster! -Click now! -Goodness. -It's frozen. -The website is down. Don't do anything. Don't click the refresh button, okay? -You're going too fast. -If you do, you'll ruin everything. -What's wrong with this? -Don't talk to me right now. -This is driving me crazy. -It's working. It's working now. IT HAS BEEN REGISTERED -It works now. Okay! -Mine's still not working! My computer shut down. -Okay! Nice. -Is yours still not working? -Did you get into the class? -Yes! I got in! -Do it quickly! -I got in. I did it. -I'm not worried about the rest. -Gosh. I don't think I can get into the next class. -Try your plan B. -I want to be in that class too. Too late. Try your plan C. Guys, it looks like I'm doomed. I have three 9:00 a.m. classes. -This tastes so refreshing. -You feel refreshed? It looks like I should take this semester off or something. Don't be so upset. At least you got into Professor Han's class. Right, you should be happy about it. That's the only good class. Look at the rest. It's honestly so depressing. You're right. I'd take the semester off too, if I were you. What's this? You have no 9:00 a.m. classes? Look at hers. That's not fair. Why do our timetables look so different when we pressed the same buttons? It's because your fingers are so short like this. -And... -Listen. -It hurts. There's Jeong! -You wanna die? You're so... It's Jeong. Jeong is here. Hello. -Hi, Jeong. You're early. -Hello. -Hi, Sang-cheol. You're here. -Yes. Hey, Seol! I heard you got a full scholarship. You hit the jackpot. Take all of us out for dinner. You're right. She wouldn't have gotten it if it weren't for Jeong. She should take him out for barbecue ten times. -Totally. -Ju-yeon, what do you mean by that? You didn't know? Mr. Heo lost Jeong's paper. That's why the scholarship went to Seol. Today is a perfect day for all of us to go for barbecue. Take us out. We want to eat beef barbecue. Sang-cheol. -I'll treat you. -I want Seol to treat me. Let's go, Sang-cheol. It's my treat. Will you, then? Good to see you, Seol. Gosh, she got a full scholarship. Goodness. What's going on? I thought about taking time off because of that jerk. But according to them, I basically ended up staying at school because of him? What's going on? I feel like I'm being toyed around. Goodness. I don't like this feeling. Seol. What are you doing now? I was reading the course syllabus. I'm done now. It's good to see you again. -Want to have lunch with me? -Pardon me? -You haven't had lunch yet, right? -No... but I normally don't eat lunch. PERSONAL TIMETABLE What's wrong with him? What was that about? Did I do something wrong? People may not know, but I do. I didn't do anything wrong. The scary side he's hiding behind that fake smile of his. Seol! Where are you going? -Did Jeong find you? -How do you know? -I told him. -Bo-ra! So he found you. What did he say? -He asked me out for lunch. -That's great. He probably wants to take you out for lunch to mend the relationship. He's so generous. You don't know him at all. What do you mean? Did you run away again? You, fool. You always avoid Jeong, so he must be frustrated too. You're probably the only person who doesn't like him in our department. Look at that witch, Nam Ju-yeon. She's always hovering around him and buttering him up, -saying, "Jeong, Jeong." -No, no. Jeong probably just wanted to have lunch with Seol, but she jumped to conclusions. -"Does Jeong like me? What if we..." -Excuse me. -Stop writing a novel. -I'm sure that's what happened. -You totally jumped to conclusions. -Stop teasing her. Let's just go and get lunch. I'm hungry. -Okay, let's go and eat. -You should have gone with Jeong. Don't regret it later. Sang-cheol, please take us out for lunch! -Okay. -Take us out for lunch. -Please buy us lunch. -All right. I'll buy you lunch. -He's the rich one. Ask him. -Really? -Jae-u! Buy us lunch. -Take us out for lunch, please. -Sang-cheol! -Whatever. I'm so glad I could at least get into this class. Look how crowded it is. It's packed. Half of these people must be here to beg their way into the class. I told you. Aren't you happy you listened to me and ran? Seol, you're the best. -Hello. -Hello. Gosh, there are so many of you. Some are even sitting on the stairs. It looks like we need a bigger classroom. I guess some of you here couldn't enroll in the course. Can those people raise their hands? I see. I'd love to have you in my class, but we cannot exceed the course capacity. I'll call the roll and those of you whose names aren't called should leave the room before the class starts. Well, I heard that Professor Kang's class is great. No, trust me. It'll be very organized, and you'll learn a lot. She's much more competent than I am, so you should take her class. And please don't visit my lab to ask me for favors. Especially you, pretty ladies. I won't give special treatment to anyone. All right. I'll call the roll now. -Nam Ju-yeon. -Here. -Jang Bo-ra. -Here! -You Jeong. -Here. -Choe Ji-yeon. -Here. -Ha Mi-jin. -Here. -Heo Kyeong-ju. -Here! Okay. It looks like everyone is here. -I'll begin the lecture now. -Why didn't he call your name? Ask him. You don't want to be marked as absent. Professor Han! My name hasn't been called. What's your name? I'm Hong Seol in the third year. I don't see you on the list. Are you enrolled in the class? -We got enrolled at the same time. -That's right. Is that so? Then stay for today's lecture, and let's look into it later. -All right. -What's going on? -I'll begin the lecture now. -You double-checked, right? -I even printed the timetable. -I know. -This is your name, right? -Yes. Come here. You see this, right? "Registration canceled." -It says right here. -Well... -That's impossible. -Gosh, go away now. There must have been an error... I'm busy. I have to answer this call. -Sorry, but could you check... -Go away. Hello? Yes. Registration is now closed, so there's nothing we can do. -I'll have a quick look. -Goodness. Just call the professor directly then. What? Did you just say, "Darn it"? Hey. What's your name? No, no. You should come here. Don't even call if you're not gonna show up! Never mind. Thank you for your help. How is this even possible? Someone stole your ID and password and canceled your enrollment right away. How did they find out her password though? Someone could have been watching her when she was logging in. It looks like that person took your spot in the class. -What time did you say it happened? -Right, tell us again. -It was eleven... -Look at you, Ha Jae-u! -Did you buy a new laptop? -It's none of your business. Anyway, we need to find out who did this and tell everyone about it. This person needs to pay for what they've done. Listen. I'm in Professor Kang's class, so I'm bothered by this. Why are you being suspicious of everyone because of her? This happened and we need to find out who did it. Goodness, you really get on my nerves. Just go and mind your own business. You can just enroll in a different class. I don't understand why you're making a big fuss about it. I get that you're obsessed with your grades, but you shouldn't be suspicious of innocent people. -It doesn't seem right. -Look, Nam Ju-yeon. Didn't you come to school so early to enroll in Professor Han's class because you're obsessed with grades? It sounds like you think someone canceled your course registration on purpose. Don't be suspicious of people when you don't even have evidence. You did it last year, too. Looks like you're enjoying this. Hey! Watch what you say! -She's so stuck-up! I can't stand her. -Everyone's watching. Gosh, I'm so infuriated. Just leave me alone. I must catch this person. The need to take responsibility. Yes. I want to be cool about it and just laugh it off too. But if I take Professor Kang's class, it'll be hard to get a scholarship. Then I'll need to take next semester off, too. Gosh, what a mess. But the registration... was canceled around 12:00 p.m. I was at the library then. Seol. Seol. Hi, Jeong. -Are you in this class too? -Yes. What brings you here? Well, I figured this class would be less crowded. You probably did too, right? I guess I probably did. I did. You're funny. It's not funny at all. Darn it. How did I end up in the same class as him? Is this really a coincidence? Someone could have been watching her when she was logging in. What if... That's right. He's definitely capable of doing it. You're done for the day, right? -Do you want to go for dinner? -No. Why not? Do I make you feel uncomfortable? Well, that's not why... I'm going to go see Professor Han and beg him. You said that your course registration got canceled, right? I think someone did it on purpose. Does anyone come to your mind? I'm not sure. But I'll be sure to find out who did it. I'll see you later. There are 80 students in total. I can't really run every single student number through the system for this, can I? Well, I could do it. It's doable. But it'll just show that her registration was canceled. -Is there anything else we can do? -We could ask the security team for help, but they'll only be able to find out the IP address. They won't be able to find out who did it. I have a favor to ask you. I understand the situation, but unfortunately, there's nothing I can do. I heard that professors have the authority to accept a few additional students. Please help me. I really want to take your course. Gosh. This is why I said pretty girls like you shouldn't come here. Goodness. You shouldn't talk like that to your students. -Hello. -Yes, hi. There are still spots in my class. Why not? My course is also a prerequisite for your major. You should enroll in my class instead. What's wrong? You don't want to take my class? -Well, that's not what it is. -Then what is it? I see. You're scared because everyone calls me a witch, right? Witch Kang. That's my nickname, isn't it? I heard that all students call me Witch Kang. I just find it hilarious. You guys don't know me well. I'm actually very nice and sweet. Why are you laughing? Sorry, it's nothing. I don't think I can squeeze you into my class. You should enroll in Professor Kang's class instead. You'll find out that she's a nice person once you get to know her. You'll learn a lot from her as well as from her class. -You'll be good to this student, right? -Of course. Don't even worry. I always treat all of my students very well. What's your name? My name is Hong Seol. Hong Seol? Gosh, what a pretty name. Nice to meet you. Likewise. I got this for you. If I take the 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. classes on Tuesdays, I can't take this... Gosh, what a mess. What a way to start the semester off on the wrong foot. You Jeong, that jerk. I'm so angry. Hello, welcome... How did he find out that I work here? What can I get for you? I'd like an Americano -and a strawberry milkshake. -Strawberry milkshake. Your total comes to 8,000 won. -Do you need a receipt? -No. Here they are. That's yours. What's this about now? What's going on? Hello? Hi, Su-kyeong. Why aren't you here yet? Bye! -Lim Gyeong-hwan. -Here. -Kim Sang-cheol. -Here. It's you. You failed last time. Be sure to pass now, alright? -Son Min-su? -Here. Hong Seol. Hong Seol? You must be curious about how you'll be graded. Attendance takes up 20%. Midterm and the final exam make up 50%. Group assignments take up 20% and individual assignments will be ten percent. Plus, there'll be two group presentations, the first one at midterm and the second at the end. What's wrong? It's not like you didn't know how it was going to be. I'm sure you've all heard about my classes. You all want to take an easy class, don't you? Then go and take another class. Everyone, wake up now. I'm sure all of you want to be successful in life. Do you want to ruin your life in this tough economy? No, right? Who is it? -I'm sorry. -Come in quickly. You're late. Listen carefully. Being late thrice will count as one absence. If you miss three classes, you'll automatically fail. Even during the correction period, I'll check your attendance and punctuality, okay? -Okay. -Understood. -Hong Seol? -Yes. You were late today. Hong Seol? Yes. Show me your textbook. It looks like you came empty-handed. Aren't I right? Everyone, open your textbook. Look at this. Look at you all. Listen. Have you not heard about my classes? My lecture always begins on the very first day. The textbook is very important in my lecture. If you don't bring your textbook to the next class, you'll end up having to retake the course like Sang-cheol. All right. Open your books. Let's start now. Can I share your textbook? The main character, Ralph, who used to live in the States, suddenly became a king in England. Witch Kang hates me now. Gosh, it's because I saw that jerk this morning. Seol. Do I know you? I'm Min-su, Son Min-su. I have something to tell you. Just in case. I wanted to tell you just in case. I saw who it was. On the day we were registering for our courses, I saw the person who used the computer here right after you. Who was it? Seol. What are you doing now? I was reading the course syllabus. I'm done now. So it's Jeong again? Are you serious? Can you really trust her though? Don't you remember what you went through last year? The post about Sang-cheol. You thought Jeong wrote it and got into trouble for it. I think you have to be very careful about this. If it's not true, you'll get into even bigger trouble. Do you like Jeong that much? Is that why you wanna see him -in the CCTV footage? -Shut it, seriously. I'll just go alone to check the footage. -Gosh, don't be mad at us. -Go alone then. Just go. Do you really think I did it? You're not answering, so I guess you're suspicious of me. If you didn't do it, then tell me so. Sure. I'll see you in front of the library at 6:00 p.m. Let's check the CCTV footage together. Right, take this. I didn't think that you guys would be here. I just got one for Seol. -Don't worry. It's okay. -We're good. Listen, Seol. I don't think it's him. What are you going to do? -You're in trouble. -Are you happy now? -You're happy, aren't you? -Shut it and drink this. Gosh, it's so cold. Guys, will the lecture be any good? What are you talking about? We have to check out his lecture. -He must make tons of money, no? -Is that right? -Hello? -He must've made big money. Hi, Ju-yeon. I don't think I can come with you to the lecture today. Why not? Everyone is waiting for you now. I have to meet Seol. I promised her I'd check the CCTV footage with her. I think I can help her find out who canceled her course registration. But why do you have to check the footage with her? Are you really not coming to the lecture? I'm meeting her at 6:00 p.m., so I'll try to make it afterward. I'll talk to you later. Seol and CCTV footage? What's going on? I don't think I can go for barbecue with you guys today. Shut it. I canceled my dinner plan because of you. Let's go now. -Let's go. -Yes, let's go. -Hello. -Hi. You must be tired. This is for you. The number you have dialed cannot be reached. Please leave... It's past 6:00 p.m., and Jeong isn't answering his phone. That's strange. Is he really guilty of something like you said? -Let's not wait for him. Let's just go. -All right. Will they show us the CCTV footage, though? I'm worried they won't show it to us. I have a good idea. Let's go. -You're not going to use me again, right? -Let's just go in first. What's your idea? My dad burned everything else. That photo is the only thing I have left. That photo helped me get through even the toughest times. Sir, I really have to find my wallet. Without it, I'll have nothing to look at when I miss my mom. Goodness, what a headache. Sir, I beg you. Please? Be quick, okay? I'm going to go do my rounds. -Sure. Thank you so much. -Thank you. -Seol, what was the date again? -February 16. It was 11:52 a.m. -Or was it 11:53 a.m.? -It's here. -Where were you sitting? -At the end of there... What? You were in one of the CCTV blind spots. Goodness. Why did you have to sit there? Then we can check who came in and left, right? I'll go back to 11:40 a.m. Let's see who walks in. Here! I see Jeong. He's quietly watching you. He's walking up to you now. He's approaching you. Was this when he asked you, "Do you want to eat with me?" "No, I've already eaten." -"How about we go for coffee then?" -"I already had coffee too." Is that how you got out of the conversation? Yes, pretty much. You're talking to him now and... Yes, you're running out of there. Did you log off before you left? You didn't? -I don't think I did. -But Jeong stayed there. You're right. He's still there. -Gosh, what if... -No way! He wouldn't have actually canceled your registration, right? Let's keep watching. Look. He's leaving now. Hang on, what time is it? It says 11:45 a.m. He left at 11:45 a.m. Seol! Then he's not the one! You said that the registration was canceled at 11:53 a.m. Gosh, why are you so paranoid with Jeong? What's wrong with you? -How will you face him now? -Get out now if you're done. Sir, I think I need to watch a bit more to find it. You really can't be doing this here. -Sir, please. -Please leave now. Get out, okay? -Please, sir. -Get out now. -Please. -I just need to watch a little bit more. What a nuisance. Why did you do it? What did I do? If you didn't do it, why did you show up there at that hour? Jeong. What about you, then? Why were you there? I was curious to find out who did such a thing to Seol. I found the IP address through Mr. Heo. Turns out it was the computer Seol used at the library. So I looked through the CCTV footage. Jeong. I made a mistake. Help me. Please let it go this once. If you can pretend to know nothing, there won't be any problem, right? You know I wouldn't have intended on doing such a thing, right? I was just going to use the computer and saw that it wasn't logged off. Then I realized the timetable was Seol's. I was gonna just log off from the session, but... Jeong, you already know. You know I have to retake the course. If I take Professor Kang's class and fail again, I won't be able to graduate or get a job. I hope you can understand. I was so desperate. -Do you understand? -You should've said these things to Seol. It's not like I got anything out of it. I logged in after canceling her registration for that class, but another jerk had already stolen that spot within those few seconds. I went through all that for someone else. Jeong. I'm really sorry, okay? If people find out about this, I'll be too humiliated to even come to school. Goodness. I'll do anything you want me to do. I'll do as you say. That'd be good, right? But... looks like the CCTV cameras need to be relocated. -What? -That computer station happens to be one of the CCTV blind spots. The footage shows you entering and leaving the library space, but I couldn't see what you were actually doing. Did you just trick me, then? I didn't mean to. I had no idea. I didn't know that... you'd tell me everything like that. Jeong, you... Who do you think it was? I have no clue. This is very frustrating. I'm going home now. Really? You're not eating dinner with us, then? Come and eat with us. -Get home safely, Seol. -Bye. If it's not Jeong, who would it be? Did Jeong really not do it? So who did it? Did you find out? Why didn't you come? Do you still think I did it? Why didn't you tell me you didn't do it? If I told you, would you have believed me? No. I wouldn't have believed him. Why did he give up the scholarship? Why is he in the elective course that I'm in? I have many questions for him, but I'm not confident... that I can fully trust his answers yet. I apologize. It looks like I was mistaken this time. -Is that it? -Pardon me? -Do you want to go for dinner with me? -No. I don't-- I don't eat dinner. I'm sorry again. Just like that, the correction period for course registration ended. I wasn't able to find out who canceled my registration, but I guess there was someone who was more desperate to be in that class than me. I decided to look at it this way. I'll put in canned tuna first. Then I should put in gochujang. Yes, hello? Hi, Mom. Gosh, I'm not a kid. You don't need to worry. I always make sure to eat well, of course. Now? I'm eating raw fish bibimbap. I made it with tuna. Gosh, this cut of tuna is the most expensive sashimi. Yes. Right. I got a few offers, and I'm trying to make a decision. I want to get into one of those big global corporations. Yes, exactly. Yes. Don't worry too much, Mom. Right, Mom. Send me some kimchi. I'm craving your kimchi. Yes. Thanks, Mom. Bye. Wait, In-ha. In-ha. Hold on. Thanks for everything. Take care and stay healthy. Bye. Wait, In-ha. Baek In-ha! What are you doing? I've done everything for you. -Are you a gold digger? -Have you lost your mind? I hung out with you and did you proud while acting all cute for you. I've done more than enough. -Don't you know give-and-take? -You're unbelievable... You know what? Forget it. You don't think guys care about what women do for work and how much money they have? You're 26 years old, and all you can do is suck money out of men like a leech. -You, jerk. Watch your tongue! -You have such a foul mouth. You're polluting my ears. -Who are you? -Stop chasing her around. You're so pathetic. Who is this scum? You're really unbelievable. Stop living your life like a piece of trash. How dare you, jerk. I'll teach you a lesson today. -Open the door, you jerk. -This is for you, witch. -How dare you! Stop, you jerk! -That jerk is crazy! Goodness. -Stop! I'll teach you a lesson. -I'm going to kill you! -Get lost! -I'll break your fingers, you scum! Your fiery temper hasn't changed, Baek In-ho. You're still the same too, except that you've aged. You're also still... Well, you're actually looking really crummy. That little... Goodness, it stinks in here. You smoke in here, don't you? By the way, why are you living here? Did you get kicked out? What are you talking about? The president got this place for me so that I can live independently. You're making it obvious that you're still financially dependent. Idiot. Whatever. Who cares? By the way, how did you find out my address? I went to your school and found out by telling them I'm your brother. I heard you quit school. School is such a waste of time. I'm not gonna get a job anyway. So you quit school and decided to suck money out of guys? -Shut it. -You're pathetic. Didn't you run away? Why do you pretend to care now? Whether I quit school or suck money out of guys, why do you care? -I just think you're so pathetic. -You're way more pathetic. Why did you show up? Did you have enough fun in the last five years? Right, look at you. From head to toe, I can just look at your clothes and figure out how you've been living. -Watch your tongue. -Right! I know why you're here. Do you need money from the president? Starting with medical expenses, you've come up with many excuses. -Good for you. You have tons of... -Baek In-ha! Shut your mouth. You're old enough to know that -you shouldn't... -Smarten up already. Pride does not pay your bills, okay? You hit rock bottom, so you should've learned your lesson. Right. I was crazy to think to check in on you as your brother. Why in the world did I end up with an elder sister like you? Did you meet Jeong? He's changed a lot, too. It's been a long while, so I'm sure he's been feeling uncomfortable, too. What do you think? Shall I call him for you? What a joke. BAEK IN-HA -The receiver cannot be reached. -Jeong! In-ho is back. Yes! You're surprised to hear this, right? Yes. The three of us should get together. It's been too long. Right. It's exam time now. I see. It'll be difficult for you to make time then, won't it? All right. I'll tell In-ho. He's saying he has exams, but it sounds like he misses you a lot. -You should go meet Jeong. -Forget it. -You just love talking nonsense. -You don't have to believe me, but wouldn't you feel better after seeing him? He goes to Yonyi University. Majors in Business. Where are you going now? Why is this jerk not answering my call? Jeong! In-ho is back. Why are you not answering your phone? The three of us should get together. Just like the old days. You know? WOULD YOU LIKE TO DELETE THE MESSAGE? YES -All right. Cha Min-hyeok? -Here. -Okay. Ha Jae-u. -Here. -Hong Seol. -Here! This already happened, so I'll just do my best. -I'm sure I'll learn something. -Management... I'm glad I don't have to see him here. Jeong, what brings you here? -I'm sorry. -What? Hold on, are you in this class? Your name isn't here, though. I switched. I thought your class would be more fun. Is that right? I'm happy to see you here. Smart students love my classes. All right. Shall we begin now? -Strategic management. -Seol. Let's look at page 12. Hi, Seol. What does he want from me? I was already weirded out by him, but he started acting even more strangely. Why? Am I bothering you now? I'm really bothered by you too. -Are you close friends with him? -No, not at all. Seol! Do you want to go for food? Let's go and eat. Why is he so obsessed with eating with me? Come to your senses, Hong Seol. You can't let that smile fool you. He's sly like a snake and... There are guys with dark agendas who you can't read or figure out. Don't be too excited thinking that Jeong is interested in you. -He's friendly and sweet toward everyone. -I never gave you special treatment. -You're such a joke. You're so pathetic. You're still drenched in guilt. You don't seem to feel guilty at all about ruining someone's life. Guilt? Why should I feel guilty? You. Come here. I like you. You're the only person who treats him like that. Me? I'm saying this because I'm worried. Seol is in danger now. Don't worry. She'll be fine. This feels somewhat different from how it's been. Does he really mean it? Gosh, I don't even know anymore.
