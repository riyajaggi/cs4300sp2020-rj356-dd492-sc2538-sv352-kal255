 [acoustic rock music playing] [sizzling] Hey, man! You're up. Let's not jump to any conclusions. There's coffee in the pot. Sumatra. Mmm. Like I've been in a coma. Yeah. Heavy shit will do that to a person. Yeah. [rock music playing] I can't remember the last time you made me breakfast.

 - I think it was our honeymoon. - [chuckling] So, man, have you thought about what you're gonna do? With the store and with London? [sighs] Look, man, can I just... can I just eat this, and then we'll get into it? Yeah. Yeah, man. Sorry. It kind of makes sense, though. What does? She was always asking questions about you. No matter what it was that we were doing, she would always bring it back to you. Uh-huh. Yeah, it really burned me up at the time. Now that I know that she had sinister intentions, I don't feel so rejected. That's great, man.

 Good for you. You know, all things being equal, there's a good chance that she might have gone for me instead of you. - But I guess we'll never know. - I guess not. - Police! On the floor! - Whoa, what the fuck? - Oh, fuck, George! - Hey, man! [laughing] - Man, put the fucking gun down! - Whoa! Put the gun down. Oh, my God. Yeah. Fuck, man. - Geez. - Oh! That was good, Chip. [Dennis] Want a plate? No, man, I'm good. I ate already. About a couple hours ago. Didn't see you boys at the meeting this morning. Right. He doesn't want to talk about it. He just wants to eat his breakfast. No, I get that. You can take a beat, circle the wagons. What do you think, George? I think she's coming here to sue. For what? Wrongful death. Negligible homicide. - Negligent. - Right. Unless somebody killed you, that would be negligible homicide. No, I think she's going to take him to court and try to make him pay for what he did. - I already paid my dues. - You did. I stood in front of a judge and I admitted what I'd done... that I killed a man. - Yeah. - I killed her brother. And I... I never flinched. I never once tried to shift blame. - No, you took it head on. - And I got the help that I needed, and... and I got sober, and now, I help others. You helped me. Now, she wants to come here, years later, and... and... [Dennis] What? Try to squeeze you for a few bucks? Sounds like you guys got it all figured out. - It makes sense. - It does. Everyone's always trying to put a price on their emotional loss. Is she stupid? What do you mean? Look, you said she was here for a payout, right? I mean, after she tracked you down, how long you think before she figured out that, you know, the well is dry? Well, just because Chip doesn't have any... just because it may seem that he has not accumulated financial wealth, that doesn't mean that she can't put a line on him. On what? - Well, they could garnish his wages. - [stifled laugh] What wages? They sold the store. You got nothing now. Then, what is she here for? She's here to haunt you. - Like a ghost? - Mm-hmm. She's just here rattling her chains. Whoa. That's... That's kind of, uh... Shit. That's the only explanation there is. You got any more of these fried potatoes? Hey. It's me. Yeah, I'm... I'm okay. I... I still don't know. I... I just... Yeah, just a bit more time. I just... I wanted to call because... 'cause it's our big day, and, um... I just wanted to let you know that I'm thinking about you. No, David, I don't want to speak to your mom. Hi! Hey! How are you? How's the swollen ankle? - All right, just don't split this time. - No way, man. I would never let you down. Oh, hey. Let me get a number one Happy Meal. Cooler... [woman on intercom] Can I help you? Yeah, I'm here to see Tilly. Do you have an appointment? Uh, no, but I'm... I'm her husband. I'm sorry. She asked not to be disturbed. Can you just tell her it's me and... and that I need to talk to her? I'm sorry. She asked not to be disturbed. This is important! She asked not to be disturbed. Dude, sounds like she doesn't want to see you. - [engine starting] - Maybe next time just call her so I don't have to drive us all the way out here. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. It's actually pretty hard to hear. It sounds like... are you at a party? Oh, you... you went ahead with the reception. No, no, no. Yeah. You... you did pay for the room. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. [sighs] Okay. Gotta go. [Kara] ...support and sign this, though, you know, thanks. - Save Venice! Sign a petition. No? - No, thank you. - Hey! I was going to call you. - Oh, yeah? Yeah. What are you doing later? Uh, nothing. Got no plans. Why? You want to do something? A bunch of us are going to march down Abbot Kinney to protest that hotel development. - You should come. - Okay. Yeah. Uh, what time? Here. "Save Nice"? How do I... how do I do that? So, you and Chip, huh? Yeah, yeah. We got back together. Mm. Come on. Don't look at me like that. - Like what? - Like that. Like I've been played. I haven't. He's going through a legitimately tough time right now. Yeah, okay. You mean the store? Yeah, the store and... that's part of it. There's just... There's a lot of other shit, too. So...? Look, he's not a bad guy, okay? He's going through a lot of turmoil right now. So, take it easy on him, yeah? All right. We can't blame other people for our own unhappiness. - Did Chip say that? - I don't... Yeah, probably. Right. Well, I have to go. I don't want to be late for the first day of work. - Right. - See you later. Bye. - Yeah. "Save Nice." - Yes! I don't think I've ever counted to more than, like, six hundred before. Whoa, man. Shit. That's not a good sign. Looks like they sold your store. - [Chip] I'm on it. - Sweet! Cooler, I need you to run this over to Wiener-Kaufmann. - What? Why me? What'd I do? - Well, you have a car. And it's a job that even you might not fuck up. Come on, man. I just got here. Check out that sweet spot I just kojacked. Sorry. Can't we email the box just to be more environmental? No. - Can I get gas money, at least? - Nope. [woman] Hello, Chip. - What the fuck are you doing here? - [groans] That's no way to speak to a lady. You're right. What the fuck are you doing here? Fuck, man. You're Vanessa Weiss. The super agent! I sent you a tape a couple years ago 'cause I'm, like... I dabble in stand-up, but mainly my thing is, like, drama. - A tape? - Yeah. I guess it's, like, ten years ago, but did you get a chance to look at that yet? Is there somewhere private we can talk? Step out of my office. - [sighs] Do you...? Cooler... - Right, yeah. Sorry. Hey, this has been a lot of fun. We should do it again. And it's just an honor to meet V-dubs in the human flesh. Cool. I heard you went up to the house to see Tilly. Oh. I get it. You're here to do cleanup. She can't help you, Chip. She feels terrible about the store. I'm sure it's a real fucking gut punch, but she... she can't use her relationship with Wiener to influence the development one way or the other. - She wants you to know that. - "Her relationship with Wiener"? - She told you that she... - I didn't realize it was with Wiener... - Oh. - ...until just now. So, um... what were you doing up at the house? - I want a new deal. - A new deal? Isn't that what you do? I'll talk to Tilly and see if we can fit something in. No. This happens today. Okay. Wow. I don't remember you ever being this direct. Desperate times. - Hey! - Hey! You good? Everything under control? Know what you're doing? Yeah, I think so. Thanks. Everyone's been really helpful, especially the boys. - Cool. I'm here if you need anything. - Cool. Thanks. Hey... Sorry. You and Chip, you dated, right? No, we didn't date. We just hung out, really. Well, made out, mostly. But did you want more than that, or...? I knew what I was doing. I'm an adult. I didn't have to let myself get hurt if I didn't want to. Yeah, but if he hurt you, you don't have to make excuses. I'm not. He's a good person. He's been good to a lot of people. It's just not fair for me to, you know... just because it didn't work out between us. Hey... We can't blame other people for our own unhappiness. Guess not. Man, it's like... it's like I have to do everything around here, man. Hey, hey! Cooler... the petitions, man. Oh, shit. Yeah. Okay. Good call, Chip. I would have forgotten those. Hey, yeah. Hey, man. Uh, we'd like to see the dude in charge, please, ASAP. We're from Save Venice, and we're going to destroy this whole evil empire you've got going on, okay? - Do you have an appointment? - No! I don't need an appointment. - I'm afraid that you do. - Really? Just tell Wiener that Chip is here. Chip? Yeah. So, do you know this Wiener dude, or what? No. - He's fucking my ex-wife. - Oh. Shit. I didn't think you guys were divorced yet. Fucking your wife. Yeah. Well, man, so... he's fucking your wife, and then he tries to evict you from your spot? He's, like, got it out for you. Huh? - [doorbell buzzing] - All right! All right, all right! Hang on a minute! - Oh, hey, London. - Hey. Is, um... - Is Chip here? - No. No, he's not. - I don't know where he is. - Okay, cool. Well, thanks. Hey, lady? Excuse me. Hi. Can I use the laboratory please? Lavatory? - Down the hall to the left. - It's over there? - Leave the box. - All right. [woman clears throat] Chip? Yeah. Oh. Hey... you! - You don't know who I am. - No, but... No, I'm saying you don't. We haven't met. Oh, okay. Yeah, you're right. Please, follow me. Yeah. Great. Thanks. Ah... [chuckles softly] So this is the hotel development? - This is your office? - Yes. - You're A. Wiener? - Alicia. Wait. So, you and Tilly are les... lovers. - That surprises you? - No. No, it's... Well, yeah, actually, it does surprise me a little that my ex-wife... Still your wife. Yeah. ...is... a lover of another woman. Does Jerry know this? That his daughter is the lover of another... Eh... No, that his store is a part of the hotel development. Jerry doesn't care, so long as he gets a good price. Right. So, the store... [Alicia] Is going to be... a dog park. - Do we really need one of those? - More than we need a stool store. Trust me, it's an upgrade. If I were you, I'd be more than a little worried about the Save Venice campaign. They're no joke. They got momentum. They got, like, ten thousand signatures on the petition. They could get a million and it wouldn't make a difference. It's just public opinion. You know this is going to ruin the lives of a lot of good people, right? And yours. Yeah. You know, I don't get it. Tilly sticks up for you all the time. It's like you have this hold on her. I don't know what it is, but you cast a very long shadow. She just refuses to see you for the leech and the parasite that you are. Yeah, I'm good here. - I'll walk you out. - Don't bother, sweetheart. You know what I don't get? Why you people won't take me seriously. - Why did you come here? - Tilly needs to talk to me. I told that to Vanessa Weiss two hours ago. I'm done waiting. Bro, did you see how many hot girls were in there? They come to the same place every single day, man. I should get a job. - Dude, you've still got the petitions. - Shit. [ringtone chiming] Took you long enough. Yeah, I know. We're all busy, Vanessa. Good. Yeah. No, that doesn't work for me. No, I tell you what does work... Yeah, I know. This place isn't in Venice. Gelson's parking lot on Maxella. That's in Marina del Rey! Well, then tell her not to take Lincoln. Like shooting fish in a barrel, dude, it is! - [knocking on door] - [barking] [Dennis] Hey, Cooler! Come on, guys, chill out. It's open. Hey. Hey, guys. Hey, man. Hey, Dennis. What are you doing in this part of town, dude? - You mean Mar Vista? - It's not Mar Vista. Man, you want to have the same conversation all over again? Sorry, man. I just... I'm looking for Chip. Went by the store, he wasn't there. Called his cell, he didn't pick up. No, he's at the Gelson's, man. Marina del Rey. - What? Is he buying groceries? - No, he went to go meet Vanessa Weiss. Oh, is she that agent? She looks after Tilly, right? Yeah. Yeah, he knows that dude. Said he'd put a good word in for me, which is cool. All right, man. - Hey, man. Can I ask you a question? - Yeah, sure. You think if I change my name, it would give my career a shot in the arm? Well, that depends. What is your name? Come on. How long have you known me? It's John. Then, you definitely need a new name. Fuckin' dick. - Are you sure this is the place? - Yeah. [Chip] Hey! Over here. Jesus, Chip. What the hell? What? What are we doing in this stupid parking garage? - I wanted total privacy. - [horn honks] Jesus. Chip, you're not getting a new deal. The deal that you had suited you fine all these years. Yeah, it suited you fine. I gave... I let you have a life. You just don't like the idea of living up to your end of the bargain. His sister's here, in Venice. She came to find me. - Whose sister? - The kid. The kid's sist... The fuckin'... [shopping carts rattling] - What does she want? - I don't know. What does anybody want? It's always money. There is nothing else. Yeah, I'm not so sure. I don't know. So, you're scared, and you think she knows something, and you want to extend the deal. You want me to stop the hotel development so you can keep the store. That sounds about right. Okay. Let's go sit and discuss this over a nice lunch. I didn't come here to negotiate or eat lunch. Are you fucking threatening me? Yeah, I guess I am. Wow. [soft rock music playing] [ringtone chiming] - Hey, man. - Hey... man. Uh, how you doing? Uh, yeah, you know. [Dennis] I heard you went to see Vanessa Weiss. Yeah, I thought she could help with this store shit. And? Uh, not looking good. - So did London track you down? - No. - She stopped by to talk to you. - Oh, that doesn't sound good. Yeah. You've got to figure this out, man. You've got to go see her. - You've got to tackle this thing head on. - Yeah, you're... right. Were you there all the time? No, I just came in. - Yeah, me too. - Your... - [phone ringing] - [sighs] It's Kara. - You're not going to take the call? - I can't figure this girl out, man. I think she likes me. Well, that's not so hard to believe. I'm seeing her tonight. - [phone keeps ringing] - So, take the call. No. - [ringing stops] - In case she's calling to cancel. So, tackle it head on, yeah? Yeah. That's always the best policy. Yeah. [rock music playing] [faucet squeaks, water running] [London] Hey. - Jesus. - Sorry. Look like a ghost, sitting there in the dark. You must be used to seeing ghosts by now. So, is this the part where you stab me in the heart? Should I hide all my knives? If I had wanted to do that, I could have done it a long time ago and disappeared. I'm broke. I don't have anything to give you. I'm not here for money. What do you want from me? I just... I needed to know what kind of person killed my brother. The drunk. It's not me. I'm not that person. I... I just needed to make sure that they were in as much pain as I was... as... as I am. You know, just to make sure they'd suffered... enough. How much is enough? - Chip, I... - Listen... [sighs] Why are you... why are you still here? Because I needed to be with you. I'm not a good person. You're in pain. I'm not worth it. I disagree. Please. I'm trying to give you the out. Please just take the out. I don't want an out. - I know who you are. - No, you don't. Yeah, I do. [rock music playing] [horns honking outside] [crowd murmuring] Yeah, yeah. There he is. There he is. Oh, whoa! Sorry, man. You were getting it on. Hey, listen to this, though. Wiener and Kaufmann pulled out! There's not gonna be a hotel! [horns honking and beeping] You did it, man. You saved Venice. [rock music playing] [crowd clamoring, laughing]
