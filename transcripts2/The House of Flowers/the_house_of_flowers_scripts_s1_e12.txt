 We booked Luis Miguel. The theme of the party is, "Springtime in Japan." Since my husband's coming back from Japan for the party. Is that so? Yes. Because I've heard rumors about your husband. What? Rumor has it your husband... left you for another woman. Of course not. - Hey, this isn't coming from me. - No, sure... Like your daughter Paulina would say:

 "These are the tips we're getting at the news desk, Virginia." Listen, my dear Luka. Are we getting the cover? If the family isn't complete, it wouldn't be a complete cover. Unless... Unless... he's dead. If he's dead, all right. Then we could, I don't know, shoot it using paparazzi on account of your grief. My husband will be here. I'll prove it to everyone. - He'll attend the party. - Okay. Even your grandkids will talk about it. Mark my words. And one more thing. Don't you ever imitate my daughter again. Mm? Well done, Virginia. We wouldn't expect anything less from you. A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES My mom is something else. The anniversary party is all set.

 With the money from selling my ring. She says she got the money from some centerpieces owed to her from years back. Did you know I love you more than anything? Besides, did you know my dad's getting out of jail? Well, maybe, but... Once he's out, everything will go back to normal. As if these past few months had been a bad dream. But they weren't. And things can't go back to normal. There are consequences. Are you upset? No. But what you said was very childish. You can't think lies and betrayals can simply be forgotten, as if they never happened. Fine, I'm sorry. I just meant I'm happy about my dad getting out of jail. Come here. I'm the one who's sorry. When you visit me in Madrid, I'll take you to cool places like the zoo, or to get ice cream... And tapas, and the Chueca quarter. Yes. Anything you want. You're gonna love it. I don't know what I'll do without you. I have no one left. There's Claudio, your brother, and there's Grandma. Claudio is never around, and Virginia must be very sick, because she spends all her time with Dr. Cohen. I'll tell you a secret. I'm not supposed to tell you because it's not a sure thing, but... your dad's coming home. Really? Yes, I swear. But don't think I'm not sad about you going to Madrid. Yeah, right. No, I'll stay here for a while and wait until things settle before going back. You can fuck with Claudio while you wait. I have other plans, okay? Besides, what Claudio and I have is much deeper, believe me. Luis Miguel canceled. Oh, Mom. So did the people who were supplying the tent. This party is falling apart. I'll have to ask Paulina for help. - No. Mom. Calm down. - What's that doing there? - That shouldn't be there. - We won't call Paulina. We got this. - Mom, don't worry. We'll solve it. - Yes. I can get Mercurio to perform. It'll be a great party. No. It has to be Luis Miguel. - Older ladies hate Mercurio. - Mercurio's better. I already sent the invitations. - You're crazy. - Told the press, everything. Please, try to understand that the client, in this case, my father... is an innocent man. The one who took out these loans in his name is someone who was mentally unstable, and according to José María... José, our counselor, institutions like yours usually grant pardons even without the full amount. Isn't that right? Is it? No. We will grant a pardon when you raise the full amount. We'll drop all the charges and your father will go free. But wait a minute. Mm... I've done this dozens of times, and it's always granted. Please, I beg you to reconsider. He is innocent after all. No. Plus, it's crucial for my mother to have him attend a family event. An event? Well, tell her that your father won't be attending this little party. - This is unbelievable. - No, I just can't... Come back when you have the full amount. Let's go, Paulina. No. Who do you think you are to tell us no? Why can't you grant it? - Tell me why! - Enough. Enough. Let's see, why not? Who do you think you are? The World Bank or what? You'll regret this. Take a good look at me. My last name is de la Mora. De la Mora! You don't get it. I'm the one who handles everything. I'm the fixer, the one who takes care of everyone. And now I can't even look after my son, or get Dad out of jail. If I don't fix this, I'm worthless. So dramatic. You've already gone above and beyond. Period. They know you've done everything in your power. We both have. Explain it to them. They'll understand. Just drop it, please. You're just like that horrible man. That geezer will regret this. Remember how he said it? - "No." - "No." THE HOUSE OF FLOWERS Oh, Mom. Paulina, where have you been? The ship is sinking and you, missing as always. - Oh, Mom. - People are spreading so many rumors. They say they don't believe that your dad's in Japan. They say that he left me for another woman. Heh. Can you imagine? Oh, but... when he sits on the flower throne, finally ready for the family portrait, they'll regret having said all those horrible things they've been saying these last months. Are you going to the bank with José María? To get that pardon thing where they release you quickly? What's wrong? What... What is it? - What's the matter? - I just... Mom... I don't think... my siblings will be able to fix this. Me neither, to be honest. Well, we must have faith, Paulina. We still have much to do. I know, I think it's all this business with Bruno. I'm still processing... the fact that he may be leaving. I understand. I know how difficult it is to let go of your children, but... Especially when he is your only son. Why don't you go see Salo? Oh, Mom. Stop saying that, for crying out loud. I'm not running to my father to tell him about my issues. That's not why I said it. I brought it up because he's been helping you with this since you were a child. Right, but I can't go to him now, knowing he's my biological father. I know. I know you never ask for anything, but... especially not help, but... I'm sure you need help right now, Paulina. Stop it, Mom. Stop it. THE HOUSE OF FLOWERS - Hi, Amanda. - Hi. - You're looking great. - Thanks. - Hey, I have a question for you. - Mm-hm? On a scale from 1 to 10, how well do you know Luis Miguel songs? Mm... 8.5. Okay. Do you know if there's a tanning salon close by? I have... a business proposal that you're going to love. I know what this is, but I only commit myself to one character. The whole party hinges on him being there, and if that doesn't happen, Mom will lose it. You don't have to shoulder that responsibility. What would happen if you stopped solving everyone's problems? I don't know. Would they solve their own problems? Oh, no. No. Well, suppose they do. How would that make you feel? Like I don't matter. Oh, you know what? No. I mean, all I want is to get Dad out of jail. Okay? For my parents to know I'm a good daughter, not a bad mother, that I can fix this, and for them to be happy. I can give you the six million. No. No, thanks, but... But no. I'd do it for any of my daughters. No, no, I can't accept it. All right. Think about it. This has to be a historic event for the neighborhood. Oh, a milestone. A definitive turning point. The flower shop needs to recover, I don't know... - its old strength and joy, right? - Strength, of course. Here. Sorry, you were saying? What's wrong? Is something the matter? What is it? Well... I think I need to get divorced. Why bother after so long? Oh, no, no, no. Your husband has always cheated. Just tell him to be more discreet. No, it's not that. It's because of Poncho. The...? The stripper. The strip... But leave your husband? Are you crazy or what? Don't make rash decisions just like that. This boy can be a lifelong friend. He has to be. But it's just that... No. What Poncho and I have... is deeper than that, like with you and Cohen. - Oh, no. No, no. - Yes. Enough of that. Oh, Virginia. It's quite complicated. We'll have to put a pin on this. Where are the yellow flowers? Here it is. I'm mortified by this, really. You have no idea how grateful I am. I promise I'll pay you back as soon as I can. Don't worry, I trust you. This... Do you think we could keep this between us? Absolutely. Thanks. As for the paternity issue... I just want you to know that I'm a patient man, and whenever you're ready, I'd like to have a relationship outside this office. I don't want you to think I'd ever try to take Ernesto's place. No, I know. No, I'm so grateful for this. Really. I want to show him that I love him and that I'm willing to change. This time, I'm all in. No fear. He's been a little distant lately... and it's because of me. I haven't done my best. Just the thought of him leaving me... makes me feel like dying. It hurts here, in my heart. Have you considered being a better boyfriend? That's why I'm here, Gabriel. Yes, well, a puppy won't solve your problems. You have demons you must face and conquer. Yes, but the puppy might help. Take good care of him. Come. What's up, boy? Come with me. - I'm gonna name you Pipino. - Actually, his name is Heidegger. Well, now it's Pipino. What would you think... if I accepted money from one dad to get the other one out of jail? - Mm-hm. - Even though that dad doesn't know that the other dad... is my real dad. That's not right. I don't know what I'm going to do. Let's see. You have a solution to get your dad out of jail, - offered to you by someone who loves you. - Yes. And who wants the best for you, and you don't want to take it? It's not that easy. Yes. It's that easy. That's your problem, Paulina. And the reason we were over long before I got a sex change. You're always looking after everyone, always solving their problems. And when someone offers help... your walls go up. You're incapable of seeing yourself as vulnerable. Incapable. Well, well, well. So, what? Did you get over your scare and want to do business again or what? No, no, no. I called because of your other profession. General practitioner? Oh, you're a doctor, too? Yes, my parents made me study medicine. No, I meant the other one. DJ. - Oh, right on. - Yes. I need the best DJ in Mexico, and your business card says you're the best. Obviously. So, can I borrow Frank for one night? Come on, just one night. Sure... but you have to pay. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hm. Anything you want. Sure? Yes. What the hell? Are you on Tinder? Yes. It's pretty cool. You should get the app. What? What? - What? - What...? Aren't you and I supposed to be, like, exclusive? Exclusive? Two days ago, you were engaged. Now you're married. Claudio, we've been dating for several months. I thought we had something special. Especially now that Dominique and I are over, I, well, thought we could be together, no more hiding around. I don't know... - Claudio... - No. I don't want a relationship right now. So, what is this to you? I don't know, Elena. I don't know. Mom hung herself. So much has happened that I haven't had time to grieve. Maybe that's what this was, a way to deal with the stress and this family's drama. An escape. So... this was all merely a distraction for you? It wasn't for you? Your phone is ringing, pick it up. Be my guest. What do you want, Paulina? Claudio, the safe is empty. Did you take the money? Of course I haven't touched that money. - Tell me the truth. - Are you calling me a thief? It's the money to free Ernesto. I'm not a psycho. Money doesn't just disappear. Where are you? Come here and help me figure out who took the money. What's going on? - I have to go to the cabaret. - I heard, let's go. THE HOUSE OF FLOWERS Let me be perfectly clear. The security cameras are right there. If you confess right now, there will be no consequences, but if I find the culprit through the cameras, there will be consequences. Excuse me. - The waiters. - There's no security here. What security cameras? Come on, Claudio, please. If we had cameras, I'd know who took it. It's not like I need cameras to know you sneak up there to have sex. Paulina, shut up, please. Well, is anyone ready to confess or what? Honey? I have a surprise for you. Honey? Diego? Diego? Are you trying to scare me? Diego? Diego? Pipino. Where are you? We've been robbed. Diego left me. He took his clothes and everything. You're in charge... Julián, hang on a second, please. Just hang on. - Tell them to leave, and now I... - No, but we... Tell them to leave. We'll pick this up later. - You can go. We'll talk later. - What's going on? Who is that? Who's that on the phone? - It's Julián. - What is he saying? Oh, Elena. What happened? Julián? Julián, listen to me. It was Diego. What? - Diego... - How can it be Diego? is the one who stole the money from the safe. Where else could he have gone? I don't know, think. No. Nothing aside from his office and the friend we already called. Well, some relative he's close to. They don't talk to him since he came out. Let's see, Julián, what did you do? This isn't normal. I cheated on him with Mara. - What? - I don't know how, but he found out. And then Mom asked him to give Nana's ring back. - I'm a fucking idiot. - It's not your fault, Julián. There's no excuse for what Diego did. He's a bastard and I hope he dies. - No. I want him back. - Julián! - Do you think he'll like it? - He'll love it. Mom! What? I never thought Diego could do this to us. Me neither. Well... I really don't know what I'm going to do. What will I tell the guests? Oh, what anniversary? I mean, they'll think he left me for some woman. Oh, Mom. And the cover? We'll lose it. All of it. - We'll lose everything. - I'm sorry, Mom. Sweetheart. Don't worry. In any case, we can say your father died. Oh, Dad's never getting out of jail, Mom. I guess... Dad's never getting out of jail? Everything's falling apart. I can't hold on. I don't understand why... I can't fix this. No, sweetheart, don't be so sad. Please, I'm begging you. No, no, no. Don't be so sad, sweetie, no. Don't despair, Paulina. Calm down. Now, more than ever, you'll have to stand together. I won't be able to get you out of here, Dad. I'm so sorry, I... I've done everything I possibly could, but everything went wrong. And... I have something to tell you. Tell me, sweetie. Just tell me. I know... that you're not my father. How long have you known? Ever since you came to this place. And you've still visited me and done so much for me? Do you know who it is? Sweetie... I always wondered if you'd have been better off knowing... he was your father. That way, we wouldn't have kept so many secrets from you. Maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much. You've always been a good father to me. You... You are my dad. You will always be my favorite daughter. I'll get you out of here, I swear. Subtitle translation by Matt D
