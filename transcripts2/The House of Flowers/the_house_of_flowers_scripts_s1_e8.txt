 [Roberta] They, who have always acted like royalty, finally have a lord in the house. [Cacas] Hey, hey. Isn't your son that guy "Lord Give it to Me"? - What? - From the video. What? Come, I'll show you the video. If you tell I have a cell phone, I'll chop off your balls. No, no. Make it quick, though. Papiringo needs cigarettes. - Hey, do you have any menthol lights? - Come, let's go. Goodness, no. No, no.

 Right on. Let me congratulate you. You made fine-looking kids. [chuckles] Your wife must be damn fine, 'cause you look like shit. That Julieta Venegas lookalike and this Benny Ibarra-looking fag. He didn't get his looks from me, but he did get my manliness. Look, look at him stealing the scene like that. [whistling] - You got my cigs, Goldilocks? - I'm on it. - See you. - All right.

 YOU SAID JUST THE TIP This is bad. People suck. [sighs] - I wish I had died when I was little. - Focus on the bright side. What bright side? That my tombstone will read: "Here lies Julián de la Mora, threesome-loving faggot"? - No. That's not what I mean. - No? Then what? Julián... you proposed to me yesterday. You asked me to marry you. Everything you said could also happen to me. I could get fired. But all I care about is you and me... not what other people think. [Virginia] Sweetie... Listen, Micaela, what you saw before in Julián's video... is... how can I explain... when a man loves another man very much... And they have - an extra friend or... - [Virginia] Yes. I know, I learned this in school. The bees and the pollen... They're making a baby. Exactly. In this case, there's pollen, but nowhere to put... There's no beehive. [Paulina] Don't you think you're being a bit over-dramatic? You don't know my pain. It happens to lots of people, and they all survive. It's just sex. Hmm? You didn't kill someone. [Elena] People will forget soon. The video, sure. But not me being gay. Now I'll be "Gay Julián" for everybody, no matter what I say or do. Oh, "Gay Julián." Mom was right, I should've stayed in the closet. - Enough. Let's forget about it. - Oh, yes. [Elena] Tell us about Willy, right? - What are you doing there? - Mom! - Please get up. - [Paulina] "Mommy." [Julián] This is a nightmare. [Elena and Paulina giggle] Julián, I need you to tell me Lucía's darkest secret. We have to ruin her. Hmm? I don't know, she fucked half the school at 16. - Oh, Julián. Please. - So what? We won't be part of a misogynistic culture that shames women - for having active sex lives, jerk. - Right. There must be something. Please, think. There's something, but it's dumb. Better not. Tell me. Mom, it's frivolous. I'd feel like trash saying it. She's trash. That woman is evil. Tell me. Her family got rich by illegal means. - [Paulina] No way... - [Elena] Is that true? [Paulina] How? - [Elena] Come on, tell us. - Look how your face lit up. Yours, too. [Paulina chuckles] Her grandpa used to sell drugs. [María José] LordGiveItToMe, there's a hashtag. - [Paulina] He has a hashtag. - I know, it's terrible. Not being normal in this country and most of the world, is a label that can't be removed. In a way, Julián was protected while he stayed in the closet... and didn't have to suffer what he's suffering now. You're never as alone and vulnerable as when you come out and say who you are. That's when. That's when. [mellow Latin pop music playing over speakers] I wasn't very nice when you went through it. I know that... I acted selfishly, only thinking about my pain. I just couldn't see what you were living, I couldn't understand or think what you were going through or how you felt. I was feeling betrayed, that was all I could see, but... I'm sorry. I'm so ashamed... of not being there for you and... I don't know. I hope you understand. I'm sorry. I understand, of course I do. Really? But I have to say I liked hearing that. For Bruno, and for us. [Virginia] I've brought you the scoop of the year. The naked truth about Lucía Dávila. - Really? I'm all ears. - Mm. On one condition. I want you to interview my son, Julián, in your news outlet. We need to clear his name as soon as possible. I see. I'm... very sorry to say this, but I can't help you. All the spots have already been reserved. There's just no way. I'm very sorry. Well, I guess I'll take this to another magazine. Maybe they'll even pay for it. Oh, no, no. There's no need for that, Virginia. I mean, let me make some calls and set something up. I imagine you'll be there at the interview, right? The story would be much bigger. Can you imagine? Virginia de la Mora, the face of morality and perfection, publicly supports her son. Julián, what is it? I don't want to do this. Oh, I know. Wait, please. I get you felt safer, more at ease, in the closet. But this happened now and you'll feel - vulnerable. What can we do? Tell me. - Listen, Julián, I know that panic perfectly well, and I'll tell you something: Listen to your heart, and do it for you. Remember you'll be an example. Go out, tell them who you really are. That's true. Besides, your family is here for you, what are you afraid of? Oh, no, Julián. Why you? You'll be glad. You got this. - Show some balls. - Yes. Okay. Go ahead, go ahead. [whispering] Poor thing, so dumb. Making a sex tape. - [man] Five, four, three, two, - Thank you. [man] action. Julián. Why don't you tell us about that video that got famous, and went viral, "Lord Give it to Me." Who are those two men with you? Well, that doesn't matter. Yes, I mean, it's very unfortunate that the video went public, right? That doesn't mean that Julián's sex life is open to the public, right? Speaking of going public, who leaked the video? That's a very good question. Tell me, who do you think, huh? Lucía Dávila, that social climber. [Luka] Lucía, Julián's long-time girlfriend? Yes, yes, the fake blonde. We took her into our home like a daughter, but then we realized how many issues her family had, right? Tell them, son. Tell them. Well, it's true. Lucía and I used to date, and we had a good time... but I decided to be with the love of my life, - and she didn't like... - [Luka] Wait, let me stop you there. - The love of your life? - Yes. I mean, sure. But that's not important, but, yes, I mean... Tell them about her family instead, where did they come from? What's Lucía's family background? Tell them. The love of my life is Diego Olivera... and... well, I'm tired of hiding. I want to say that I love him and we're getting married. Congratulations, Julián. Congratulations. Now, Virginia, I have to ask: How do you feel about it? You don't care what people will say? No, well, let me tell you one thing, we don't care about being perfect. I don't want my kids to be perfect. I want my family together. I want my children to be happy... and if he's happy with his partner, my home is open to them, okay? [Luka] Okay. If you don't mind, Virginia, I'll stop you right there. Now, Julián. [Julián] Yes? What does your father think? In fact, where is he? - In Japan. - In Japan. - In Japan. - In Japan. Hey, Delia, this thing about the 10,000 views that they say, that news goes viral, and a success, after getting 10,000 views. I don't understand. Look, ma'am. That's a common misconception. True viral videos reach five million views within the first three to five days, no more. You must be wrong. How can it be five million? The worst part is that no one cares about the Lucía story. That's good, ma'am. It's a vindication. It means that people aren't so superficial. But I wanted her to be a little rattled at least. [cell phone buzzing] - Hello? - Virginia. [imitates static] I can't hear you. I have bad reception. Virginia, please... I know about Julián's video. I'm sure you already destroyed whoever leaked it. I don't know what you are talking about. I still know you better than anyone. What... Everything I did... My revenge didn't work. Are you giving up? That's not the Virginia I know. I've always admired your strength and determination. If anyone hurts your loved ones, they pay for it. You're ruthless. [chuckles] Yes. Do you remember when Elenita was in elementary school? That awful kid stole her friends so I planted lice on her. - How could I forget? - [Virginia chuckles] My kids have the best mom. Oh, I do my best, really. At least I try to. Speaking of kids... how's Micaela? Micaela has a knack for flowers. I have to go. Don't give up on revenge. I won't. I love you. I love you, too. [chuckling] WHEN YOU'RE STILL HUNGRY #LORDGIVEITTOME Delia. Ma'am. So, where's Virginia? She's at the supermarket. Poor thing. I hope she makes it out alive... people are talking. Too bad Ernesto isn't here to help her get through such hard times. Phew. I mean, Japan is very far away. I guess. And the family is falling apart. The question is... Where is he? I assure you, he's on a trip. Well, I assure you he isn't. May I? [Paulina] Are you all right? [sighs] Oh, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Now I can't even pull off a simple revenge. Sure you can, Julián's interview turned out amazing. Honestly... I feel like... everything is falling apart... badly. Mom, everything's fine. Everything's fine? Paulina... how can everything be fine? Your father cheated on me for 20 years with a woman who hung herself in my flower shop, leaving me with their child. Your sister, Elena, isn't she dating a darkie? Your dad is in jail... your brother is making gay pornographic videos, or "bi," I mean, I can't even follow. [sighs] And you, my dear... walking around with a transvestite husband. - She's not my husband. - Tell me, what's fine? - Okay. - She's not my husband. And she's not a transvestite, she's transsexual. Sorry, sorry. Besides, don't say "darkie." I mean, you can just say "black." [chuckles] I think we'll have to move to another neighborhood, or perhaps a different country, or a different planet, because... It's so hard to keep all these secrets that are happening to our family. - Please. - Mom, we're together. Isn't that what you said? Well, except for Dad, I know. But we're together. Besides, do you think other neighborhoods don't have all kinds of secrets, rumors and gossip? I don't know. I don't know, all I do know is that I've truly done my best. Oh, Mom. You've done a great job. - I don't know. - You know, if you want to run into Lucía, it's easy because that girl posts everything she does on social media. - She does? - You can find her like that. I can help you look if you want. Oh, you're so bad. A little, I guess... - I want to fuck up that damn blonde. - [laughing] I got confused! And tangled up with all the lies! I told Mrs. Carmela things I shouldn't have, she knows something's up. Listen, first of all, relax, Delia. What good is it if you're upset? Okay? Come on, breathe with me. Breathe. [inhaling and exhaling] Just calm down, okay? Eleni, it'll be my fault if people find out that your dad is in jail. Well, no, more like Carmela's fault for being so nosy. I can't stand Carmela, Delia. You know what? Yes. I'll handle Carmela myself. Ah. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. [Elena] You say you're Mom's best friend, but keep trying to ruin her life? All you care about is dirty gossip. If Julián's gay, my boyfriend's black, if my father's in jail, why the hell do you care?! You old gossip! Every...! Oh, sorry. It sort of fell. So, your father's in jail? No. I mean, he's not in jail, he... I fucked up. Diego. [Diego clears throat] How are you? Fine, fine. Go ahead, young man. Hey, I didn't know you were gay. I didn't know I had to put it in my résumé. My co-workers know, as do most of my clients. I don't understand why my sexual orientation should be an issue. Your sexual orientation isn't... but the video being circulated around the office is. It's already everywhere. Okay... But don't worry. I'm not going to fire you, but this will cost you some clients. Excuse me. - Hello. - [woman 1] Hi, how are you? - I'm a little late. - Don't worry. I'm meeting my friend Lucía. Let me check. - That's her. I saw her. Thanks. - [woman 1] Yes? Okay. Go ahead. [woman 2] I feel sorry for poor Virginia, now she has to deal with her gay son. [chuckles] Men turn gay because of overprotective mothers. [Lucía] No. I guess I always knew Julián was sick in the head. Maybe he could use a little electroshock therapy. Oh, no! All of them should be electrocuted. They're all sick. [shouts] [shouts] What? Are you crazy? You're the crazy one. How can you talk about my family like that? - [Lucía gasps] - You sat at our table, I treated you like a daughter. You disgust me. And don't talk about family, because your family, with their new money, they got rich through strip clubs and drugs. You'll end up alone. Sorry, I went a little too far. But anyway, short hair is in, see? [chuckles] Gaby, please fix her up. Ladies. [woman 1] Lupis, you won't believe what I just heard. [chuckles] [cell phone ringing] - Son... - [Julián] What's up, Mom? Please tell your sisters I'm dying to go to the cabaret tonight. THE HOUSE OF FLOWERS [Virginia] Cheers, honey! How do you feel? - [Paulina laughing] - Yeah, sure. - Well, let's make a toast. - Let's see, let's see. To my Julián, to my Julián. Because we love him, just the way he is. - Sometimes. - Yes, exactly! All the time. [Virginia] All the time. [upbeat dance music playing over speakers] Can we talk? Sure, what's up? Follow me. - Where? - Just follow me. No, Claudio, we agreed we wouldn't do this. No, no, no. No, that's not it. I want you to see my show. [dance music playing on speakers] No, Claudio. Really.
