 And you? How was last night? Me? Fine, fine. Had fun with the guys. They say they had a blast in Ibiza. Everything all right? Too many drinks. There's juice in the fridge. But they say beer is best for a hangover. Do you like it? Or is it too much for a YouTubers' convention? You look handsome. Yeah. You should get in bed. Although they might call. I'm... expecting a package. Do you mind staying home and waiting? Don't worry. I'm not leaving. Mm. Okay. DESPICABLE - VILE - INSECT - BETRAYAL - SLUT FRAGILE 7. THE PACKAGE ♪ Hey-ho ♪ ♪ Hey-ho ♪ ♪ Hey-ho ♪ ♪ Hey-ho ♪ ♪ Hey-ho ♪ ♪ Hey-ho ♪ ♪ Hey, let's go... ♪ What are you doing here? What if Adri were here? Okay, yes, I confess I was putting it off because... because... Well, you know why. You feel the same. Hey, come to my place tomorrow, and we'll have breakfast. Adri isn't home. So we can talk about this in person. Breakfast? - No. - No? Do you want to go out somewhere? No. No, I can't. Really, Víctor, maybe another day. Hey, they eat breakfast in novels too. You can't starve your male character. I'm starving. Hey... Remember those tree air fresheners our parents had in their cars? - Hanging from rear-view mirrors. - Exactly. Well, maybe we could send those air fresheners with our claim, "Air fresheners are no longer air fresheners." - You mean send them by mail? - Yes. - To every consumer? - Yes. - Old-school snail mail? - Yes. Yes, because then you know they get the message. And it's something they... can touch and smell. But do people still check their mail? Right... Yeah, no, you're right. It's an old-fashioned idea. No, the concept's cool, you know. But we need to tweak it... No, it's a shitty idea. Period. Here we go again. You're acting just like the other day. What? Look, I'm not going to feel bad because you have good ideas. Oh... Okay, well... sorry. You don't have to say you're sorry every five minutes. I'm not angry. Okay. Dinner at mine tonight? I don't know yet. You are angry. That's your problem, always mixing the personal with the professional. It sucks. - Sorry. - Where are you going? Home. To work. Because today... it's not really flowing. "The millennial woman is precise but not obsessive, restrained but not submissive, cautious but not paranoid." Paranoid? For real? What's that shit about? I can't read it. They want us to believe expert sociologists did this study. As if it were a demographic study affecting all the female population. - We have to do something. - I would burn them all. Something more modern than the Inquisition? - Harassment. - What? I'd harass the publishers... with graffiti. Or, I don't know, throw rotten meat at their door. That reeks. Something that really bothers them. - No, it's not our policy. - Well, okay, but... I think we can troll the publishers on Twitter. - That'll be enough. - Mm. Well, I don't think Gloria's idea is that bad. The graffiti. So, you don't want to demonstrate because going on the streets is silly, but you want to graffiti the front of a publishing house. Exactly. I think this magazine is humiliating us, and we should do the same to them. Yeah. But that goes against the association, the community and us. So what do we stand for? You should know. You coordinate the association's community. Well, you think I was chosen for other reasons, right? Lola! Lola. Do you know what harassment is? When someone follows you to your house. I need to talk to you. - You're ridiculous. - Can we get a coffee? - Lola, please! - Look, you can fool Dani, but not me. Let's have a coffee, and I'll explain. See that bar there? They have a breakfast menu. The coffee is great, but their juice isn't freshly squeezed. It's almost as fake as you. ♪ Hey-ho ♪ ♪ Hey-ho ♪ ♪ Hey-ho ♪ ♪ Hey-ho ♪ I love... my cup. Right... - I didn't want to do the dishes and... - Yeah. I can't touch any of Adrián's stuff. Got it. Excuse me. How are you? Very hungover. Yeah. Me too. I also think we're putting it off. Remember, in Valencia, when you asked me what I wanted from you? Yeah... Get to know you. Really. See if there's something more. And there is. And... that scares me a bit. What about you? I feel different with you. Different? Yes, uh... but in a good way... Like... like you inspire me. You give me ideas. You encouraged me to finish my novel. Thank you. No, thank you. For breakfast. They don't have breakfast in novels. - No? - No. - Hm. - It's the most boring part. So... I always skip it. Aah... And... what would you write... now? Well... Shit, the package. What package? - Yes? - Val! It's me, Carmen! - I sent a thousand messages. - Uh... I can't find my phone. CAUGHT - HIDE - RUN! Okay, when you were starting out with Adri, did you make up problems then too? Yes, I guess. Like everybody else, right? No, not like everybody. I'm crazy. All I can think about is that he's going to dump me. - Why? - That's insecurity and fear. - Yes, fear. But what am I afraid of? - Well... - Um... - Hey, can I? I'm anxious. Sure... Well, you're afraid of losing him. We do lots of dumb shit when we like someone. Especially when we're drunk. Are we talking about me? Yes... yes, of course... - Hmm. - Oh. Should I go to the office and talk to him? Talk, talk! We spend our whole lives - talking things over, Carmen. - Oh. If two people feel something, they don't need words. Shit, if you like someone, then... then you like them, and that's it. You can't plan these things. They just happen. Uh... we're still talking about me, right? - Of course. Look... - Oh... - If you want to go the office, go. - Right... Or... I could go shopping, to clear my head, and then, later, I can call him, right? But if I don't find anything I like, it will be even worse... You think too much. They say it isn't good for you. - Huh. - Mmm. Hey, your phone is there. It's ringing. Yeah, you're right! Aren't you... going to answer? The thing is... internet providers have been bugging me all summer. - Aah. - Mm. Look... I don't want to lose Borja because I'm so fucking insecure. You're getting to know each other. He won't dump you for that. Yeah, but I feel like... - What? - Well, that... - What? - Please, answer that! I can't concentrate! - Oh, sure, yeah. - Yes. MOM Hi. What's up? Really? For today? Uh... Okay, okay. Yes. Uh... Uh, once I finish it, I'll send it to you, of course. Ciao. Chus... She wants 30 more pages. For today. Pfft! I can't believe it. - But that's great, right? - Sure. But I need to start now or I won't make it. No, okay. Yes, I'll leave. I'll go. I won't bother you. I don't want to cost you the Cervantes Prize. Thanks. Hey, Val... Thank you for listening to me. - You're welcome. - And if you finish early today and want to go for a walk, well... I'm waiting for a package for Adri. Okay. No problem. Hey, can you... can you keep your phone close in case I need to call you again? - Sure. Yes. - Yes? Okay. Hey, we could call the girls and... - Carmen, I need to write. - Okay, I'll shut up. - I love you. - Cheer up. I just hung up on your mother... Sorry. Don't worry. She's used to it. She always calls when I'm in meetings. By the way, you're right. We always act stupid when we like someone. Uh... Víctor... I need to tell you something. Um... - Yesterday... - Yesterday... Yesterday was yesterday. Right. No! No, no, no, not the bed! No. no, no! Please, no! Are you okay? - Yes? - Yes. You sure? Hmph... Val, where are you? I have plans to see a client, but maybe we can have a drink later, right? Something awful happened to me at the association. Wasn't Adri going to Barcelona this weekend? I don't know. I can write in the group, and we can go to your house later. Let me know. Nerea. What? I didn't like the way you talked to Olga. Well, maybe it wasn't very nice, but she's saying I fucked half the association to get votes. - Do you think so too? - No. Look... you can do whatever you want with your pussy. But Olga likes you. A lot. Yeah, but she has no right to say those terrible things. None. No. Of course not, but... Look, Olga has done a lot for this association. She found the subsidy for this place and founded the collective and... I'd hate for her to feel uncomfortable in her own house. So... I don't know. Talk to her. Okay? Apologize. Hm? Hey. Apologize if you feel like it. You make your own decisions, right? Well, it's not like that... Come on, a beer will cheer you up. I have to work. I can't... Oh, that's right. I forgot you're a child that's exploited by her parents in rural China, right? One mojito and you're on your way? That's the problem. Anything we call "feminist" becomes a fucking manifesto. You think everything is wrong all the time, don't you? No, not at all. But... I don't like to shut up and obey if I don't agree with something. And I don't think you do either. Although you've been doing it your whole life at home. Don't let that happen to you at the association. Look... what do you want to do? You want to do that graffiti. - I admit the idea really turns me on... - Well, that's it. I can't stand how they treat us in that magazine. You don't need anyone's consent. What? I like you. ...will develop diseases that adults will suffer from. Like, for instance, mental health problems, obesity or heart conditions... DANI - MOM ASKED FOR YOUR NUMBER. CALL HER, COME ON... Fuck that bitch! ♪ Hey-ho ♪ ♪ Hey-ho ♪ - Aaah! - ♪ Hey-ho ♪ - I'm really sorry! - No, no, I'm sorry! - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Sorry. - Are you sure? - No problem. - Okay. Good. - I'm sorry. ♪ Hey-ho ♪ ♪ Hey-ho ♪ ♪ Let's go ♪ Here? Are we really trusting the healing powers of a leg of lamb? Yes. Why do you have this? I bought it when I wanted to be on MasterChef. - Junior? - Ha-ha! - Very funny. - Oh! Hold on! Does it really hurt? No, no. I just think my back is going to freeze. Ah. But... you might... warm me up... if you rub a bit here, like that. - Here? - Yes, there. - The package. - Yes. One second. - Why are you here? - Do you forgive me? Lola, can we talk some other ti... Val, I'm sorry, but I need you now more than ever. - No, wait! - Uh... Excuse me? Eh... Lola, it's not... - what it looks like. - No... - No, no. - No. IT IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE - You play the cello? - I used to. It reminded me too much... of that lady. I saw she's here for a gig, playing in the summer concert series. Well, I'd have that coffee with her. - We all have our reasons for what we do. - Reasons? She probably thought it was the right thing then. Right for her. I mean, leaving your kids for the Vienna Symphony... Wouldn't you drop everything for your novel? I don't have kids. Well, sometimes opportunities arise when you least expect them. You wouldn't do it? I would leave the life I have now, but not the life I'd have if I had kids. Thank you! I... haven't called you because... I knew you wouldn't answer the phone. Yeah, I thought the same thing. You still think I'm rude, right? Lola, we're not going to talk about that now. Right... No, you must be waiting for me to go. - No, Lola... - I completely understand, damn it. You must be dying to fuck. If you haven't already, that is. Lola... Well, I still think you are rude! And sometimes you're hurtful! You should do something about it, so you don't end up like your mom. That was too far. - I don't know her. - We aren't alike. - Just from what you've said... - Fuck, she wishes. - I know you regret what you said. - I don't think you're like her. - You would never leave me. - Neither would you. Forgive me. - For everything. - For everything. Mm!

I'm moving... to Madrid. I thought you were just visiting. I'm going to teach at the conservatoire. And I'll look after your brother. A mother at 50... Doesn't suit you, does it? I also want to be close to you. Look... I don't need a mother now. I did 12 years ago. When I made Dani dinner while I was studying math. Or when I started dating, which was a disaster, by the way. Not now. All right, give me a bullshit explanation about why you left so we can get this over with. Lola... I called you... every week. But you didn't want to talk to me or see me when I came to visit. - You'd run to your grandparents' house. - What did you expect? I would welcome you with open arms? A mother has to always be there, and you weren't. Period. I know. I don't believe in all that about making up for lost time, but we could still see each other, once in a while. But I don't know you. You don't know me. Maybe we'll hate each other. So, tell me who you are. Oh, really? You want to know who I am? Now you want to know? Well, I'm a fucking mess! I'm a goddamn celiac! Well, gluten intolerant. I've swapped beer for vodka. My friends think I'm rude and patronizing, but the truth is I'm scared I'll lose them. And sometimes I act like I don't care about them, but I do... a lot. It's happened to me with some men too. Should I change? Yes. But I just don't know how. What? Shocked, right? No. Not really, to be honest. I read... all your posts. I'm a bad mother, but I'm very high-tech. I'm playing tonight. Your brother is coming. I don't think you have to change. But sometimes you have to understand that things... aren't only how you think they are. If you want to really get to know me, you'll see we aren't that different. I think we are. You're so nervous. - Look, they're coming out! - They're turning off the lights. It's empty. Let's go! No, wait. Let's go over the plan. - Are you backing out? - No, I want to go over it. I'm wasted... - You're backing out. I knew it. - No, no. - Sure, you're not! - No! OK, maybe. Look, there are cameras everywhere. We're not going to get caught, really.

But we don't want that, do we? God. And guys love it when people talk about their dicks. Now the message makes no sense. Okay, I got really carried away. - Seriously. - You're such an idiot. Let's go! MY BODY DOESN'T WANT YOUR OPINION ♪ Cada ola, que va rompiéndose en el mar ♪ No, not at all. It looks great. ADRI - HAS THE PACKAGE ARRIVED? You know Patagonian lamb only eat one type of grass? They walk for miles to find it. That's why they are so lean. I like it when you do that. What? That. I don't know what you mean. - Yes, you do. - Mm-mm. What? Hey! - Oh! - Ow. Hold on. It won't come off. Ow! Wait, my back. - Does it hurt? - Yes. Want to be on top? I have a condom. - Great. - Yes. - Look. - Okay. Hold on. Wait, let me. - Yeah? - Yeah, I'll do it. - Okay. - Okay. ♪ Tú conmigo y yo contigo... ♪ Okay. ♪ Tú conmigo y yo contigo ♪ ♪ Tú conmigo y yo contigo... ♪ What's wrong? Don't you like foreplay? What? Yes, of course I do. - You don't like when I talk, do you? - No, why? Eh? Already? - Hm. - Huh. Mmm. So, we can fit the smaller Tupperwares inside the bigger ones... as you can see. Very good. We'll put the lids... on the small ones, and close them all up. These other containers, as you can see, are medium-sized. And we have stored them the same way. What next? We're going to fill them... ...with things to save space. I, for instance, have chosen some cloth napkins, instead of using paper ones, which is key. DANI - ARE YOU COMING? Then we close them up. Perfect. NO. We put them inside, like we did with all the other containers. And, look, here we have it. The biggest container... with all the other lids, as you can see. We'll place them... WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO STOP BEING SO FUCKING PROUD? Like this. Awesome. DO YOU KNOW WHEN? NEVER ...it'll go in diagonally. Take full advantage of space... please. Like that. Fantastic. Remember, my friends, please subscribe to my channel, "Put an Adri in Your Life." And the best way... - to clean and tidy up is... - Fuck it. Don't stress. It's fine. It wasn't the best sex of our lives. It wasn't? But I really wanted to be with you. Yeah, me too. You couldn't tell, could you? Well... How do you feel? Yesterday I hooked up with the guy from the bar. I was wasted, really wasted, and I was super horny. Ohh... wow. I'm sorry. No, don't be. You don't have to apologize. We're not a couple or anything. No, I'm sorry I didn't tell you before. I don't care what you do, I... I don't tell you about my life either. But I don't hide anything. Are you leaving? Stay.
