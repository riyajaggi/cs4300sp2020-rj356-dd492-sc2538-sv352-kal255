 If taxis unite, we won't lose the fight! If taxis unite, we won't lose the fight! If taxis unite, we won't lose the fight! Val, you left your tea in the bedroom. It's a mess out there. I can't write like this. Why don't you ask them to extend your deadline? Again? I said April, and we're in May. If they don't get a preview soon, I won't get published. - Do you want to hear an idea? - Oh, Val, I have to go. I'm sorry. - Later? - It depends what time I get off. I don't know. Check it out… I've been thinking about writing in the first person, through letters.

 But isn't that an old trick? I don't know… Hey, what time is your interview at the museum? Four. Don't be late. That gig would be great for us. - Okay. - Give me a kiss. Bye. The distance between them didn't matter because their thoughts materialized. - They fell to the ground and bounced away. - ♪ Everyone I know is wired ♪ ♪ To machines, it's obscene ♪ ♪ And I'll just scream Till it don't hurt no more ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Everyone I know is floored ♪ ♪ Crawl around, on the ground ♪ ♪ Let the sound of your blood Lead the way ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Maybe I'm not sure ♪ ♪ I wanna go on, I wanna go on ♪ ♪ Maybe I'm not sure... ♪ HOW TO GET YOUR INSPIRATION BACK How to write a novel in record time. I want to write a novel in record time, but I'm suffering from impostor syndrome. Why does it affect so many writers? People who are terrified of suddenly realizing that they aren't as intelligent as they seem to be. ♪ Maybe I'm not sure... ♪ Holy shit! ♪ I wanna go on at all ♪ ♪ Maybe I'm not sure ♪ ♪ I wanna go on at all ♪ BASED ON THE NOVELS BY ELÍSABET BENAVENT FRIENDS 4EVER CARMEN - GOOD LUCK TODAY… THOUGH YOU WON'T NEED IT NEREA - THE JOB IS YOURS! THANKS, GIRLS, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE RIGHT JOB FOR ME LOLA - FOUR HOURS AND THE REST OF THE DAY OFF TO WRITE? THAT'S PERFECT! HEY! DON'T BE DOWN ON YOURSELF. YOU GOT THIS! NEREA - DON'T UNDERESTIMATE YOURSELF CARMEN - I BET IT WILL INSPIRE YOU NEREA - WASN'T IT AT 4? Shit! MUSEUM - Wow! You've done everything. - Well, I've been working since graduation. 1. THE IMPOSTOR But it looks like you change jobs a lot. Right… I still haven't found anything that works with my thing. - Your thing? - Writing. Ah! So you're also a writer. Yes. I won a short story prize, and my first novel is getting published. - The first draft is due in a week. - That sounds great. - Mm. - What's it about? Well… it's a… it's… it's a thriller. - Aah. - Mm. And would you be able to balance this job and your writing? Absolutely. But you'd be working eight-hour shifts, Monday to Friday. Eight hours? But… I read that it was part-time. No, no, no, no, no. The security guard job is full-time. Oh. - Are you still interested? - Yes, of course. You're sure? You'd also have to come in one weekend a month, some holidays… and we'd also call you in for events, which are on Thursdays from eight to 12. - In the morning? - At night. No problem. Girls, I need to see you. I want to drink all of the beer in this city. Let's go out tonight. I'm not asking you. See you tonight. Like you say, Lola, in case of doubt, call your friends immediately. And I need your help. If you had plans with Sergio, cancel them. Remember that only 42% of Spaniards have sex once… a week! ♪ Run around And run around like that... ♪ What about you, Carmen? I hope you're not thinking of working overtime again just to talk to Borja, right? Come on. I need your advice. ♪ Got that romancin' ♪ ♪ Can't slow your plans... ♪ Nerea, I know that at work you're surrounded by people complaining about their miserable lives, which are all very serious, I know. But… would you mind listening to me complain tonight? And yes, you're allowed to laugh at me. I just sent you a test. If you answer "yes" to three questions, you are codependent in your close relationships. I already did it, and it said I was clean. It's like the spirit animal test. Being an octopus is cooler than a mouse. By the way, we need to talk about the season finale… ♪ Whoo-hoo-hoo ♪ ♪ Hallelujah! Oh, mercy me ♪ ♪ Confess your sins And get down on your knees ♪ ♪ And I'll be good to ya If you're good to me... ♪ I can't believe there'll be a third season. Accusing her because of a fingerprint in the fucking rear-view mirror? Come on! I don't get it. Damn, Carmen. Sorry, you haven't finished it yet, have you? Shit, I'm sorry. Look, you can totally spoil the latest movie… - ♪ 'Cause I'm hot and I'm dancin' - ♪ Here we go ♪ ♪ Everybody in this bitch ♪ ♪ Whoo-hoo-hoo ♪ ♪ If you wanna get up Get down like this ♪ ♪ Ah, ha, ha ♪ Carmen, are you coming to the subway? I could share my ideas for tomorrow's briefing. I don't want to miss the train. - Sure. - Really? - Yeah, no problem. - Give me one minute, okay? Okay. - I'll be… - ♪ This is emergency... ♪ ...at my desk. So, Nere. You're coming, right? Tell your parents you'll be home after 11. Come on. By the way, if you can, bring the 20 euros I lent you for the cab back to Mordor. Thanks! I forgot what Madrid used to sound like. I'm getting used to the taxis honking. Goodbye, birdies! As if there ever were any. Hold on. I'll go down a different street. Hey, what do you guys think about this taxi thing? All right, I'll shut up now, and we can talk about it tonight. But, hey, if you can't make it, no big deal. But it really would be nice. ♪ Here we go ♪ All right, now get back to back. Look serious. Nice. That's it. Raise your arms. Give me a bad boy gesture. That's right. No smiling. Great. - Now, how about one close together? - Oh, yes, please. No, no, no, no, no! You don't need to hold each other. We don't want the typical shot. But we want one with some love, right? - Isn't it cold in here? - Okay. - Can we try it? - Just a little. Okay… Now how about one where we're sitting? You know, looking presidential. All right, let's go. I'm President, and you're the First Lady. - Of course. - Like this? Go. Wait, I like this side more. Very nice. - Cool! - Hey! When you're done, let's have a five-minute chat. Nashville? - You're moving to Nashville? - The home of country music, dude. Are you going to set up another photo studio there? I don't get it. Tell me why… Another studio? Photography is dead. People used to come to you because you were the expert. But this thing fucked it all up. Now anyone can be a photographer. I'll be working at a friend's bar in Nashville. Good beer, good music. That's all I want in life. And… what about this place? Chinese investors. Damn… so you got it all figured out? Hey, that's not all. Your new boss. One point five million followers. Woodstock in '69 got nothin' on her. KundAlicia? - A fucking yogi YouTuber. Great. - She's my niece. Uh... - My bad, I didn't know. Sorry. - She's looking for a new videographer. Right, but I don't know if that looks good on a résumé. What are your options? Mint? - He's hot. - That's cute. Is the dog too much? Is this too expensive? You can get them for 600 at the outlets. Great! How much does the spaceship cost to get out there? Mm-hm. I emailed you a bunch of ads in case you're interested. Oh, thanks. You're the best. So, what's up? You ever leaving the nest? Not until I finish paying back my parents for my master's. Babe, you work for them. Why don't you ask for a raise? It's tough. The firm is struggling, so we can't adjust salaries. Look! Another climber. - What? - He's number five. I'm collecting them. Let me see. Match, six. Sorry! I'm sorry, girls. Have you been waiting long? Not at all. We were just finishing your podcast. Ah... Did I go a bit overboard again? Fifteen minutes' worth of voicemails! We have lives, sweetie. In that time, Sergio and I could've gone round three. "Round three"? You wish. Married guys don't have the stamina. Mm! You would know. Let's cut to the chase. How'd the interview go? - Fine. They'll call me. - You seem excited. Thrilled. It's actually full-time. I'd have to go to events on the weekend and work some holidays. And, ladies, I have a novel to finish. - What? - You need the money, don't you? And time to write. So you're praying they don't call you. Look, the first part is due in less than a month. It has to be good, right? How many people do you know that get the chance to do what they love? To the museum not calling you. Thank you. Hey, to them not calling you. You're awful! Yes, sure. But give me those 20 euros, since I don't have a job. - Mm! - Mm. So, what's new? Come on, Nerea. Spill it. When was the last time you fucked? Fuck? How? We only go to straight bars. True. Plus, where would you take them? Because you can't go home. Or can you? Like, "Surprise! I'm a lesbian!" You should talk to your parents. - Yeah. - I should really talk to Borja. - "Talk." Just use your mouth. - She's waiting for him to do it. - I don't know… - That's way better. Let him do it. It's not… like that. Stop. It's not… You're right. I don't… I can't hit on guys. I don't know… I... I... I get nervous… I stutter. And stuttering is not sexy. - No. - Plus, it's like I'm talking to him… and I think… "When's the last time I blinked?" - What? - How about tonight, you try with some random guy? - That guy. - Eh... - Yeah, that guy. Look at him. - No. No way. - Him! - Can you stop? - I don't… Please. - I'd hit that. - I'm going to the bathroom. - What? Please, stop. I don't want to. - Come on. Don't back down. - No! I don't want to. That's so embarrassing! Why's this such a big deal? She wants some ideas for playing "strangers" with Adri tonight. How about another bucket? Hello? Val. Val! Hi! I'm gonna grab a drink with the girls. Love you. The best thing about being with a married guy is… everything is exciting all the time. He has no idea about my problems, and I don't know about his. We get together to have a great time. That's it. Aren't you afraid his wife will find out? Me? That's his problem. Right, I get it. But wouldn't that be the end of it? And you like Sergio… a lot. You're nuts. You've talked about men for an hour. Can we change the subject? I came to talk about my book. That's right. Come on! Give us a preview of your novel. Yeah! - I'd prefer if you read it when I'm done. - Aww. I can't wait to brag about my writer friend. If I had to write a novel, it would be about a girl that turns into a different person every day. And she'd know she was different every day? No. She gets into bed every night, and the next day, she can't remember who she was. Like me on January 1st. So, where's the conflict? Hey, Ms. Writer, give me some time. I'm just spitballing here. I got it! Check it out… When she turns 30, she finds out the truth and has to pick a permanent personality. Mm-hm. Keep going. Ultimately, she doesn't pick any because… because she decides, "Why can't we be who we want, whenever we want?" What? - It's terrible, isn't it? - Yes! Do you remember when we thought we'd have everything by the time we were 30? You love your job. And you're happily married. - Huh. - Girls, I don't need to have it all. All I need… is you girls. You're my everything. Aww. Actually… you girls and a nice dick. Come on! Babe, honestly, at our age, we should start drinking better beer. - Or drink more water. - No. ON YOUR WAY HOME? I'M GONNA CRASH SOON I HOPE THE INTERVIEW WENT WELL - Are you okay? - Yeah, why? I'll reformulate my question. Are you and Adri OK? I'll repeat my answer, "Yeah, why?" Just that whenever you talk about him, you make this weird face. - Not just today. - "Weird face"? No, it's because of my novel… I'm worried I won't submit it on time. Sure. - What's your plan tomorrow? - Nothing. Well, writing. - Tomorrow night? - We'll probably watch a movie. All right, enough. We're going out. - Remember my friend, Víctor? - Víctor? Yeah, the architect in Berlin. - Oh, yeah. - Well, he's moving back to Madrid. And he's throwing a huge welcome-back party at Naki. You'll get some fresh air… You can untangle that bird's nest that's been on your head recently. Nothing else works for me. - Different life stages, I guess. - Well, get past that one now. - All right, get some rest. - You too. Fuck, Lola! You're an idiot. Don't laugh. It really hurts! - It hurts more if I keep them in. - You're disgusting! - No! I don't know. Maybe a little. - Love you. - You too. - Bye. We're going to work on our whole body. We'll stretch our legs… and our arms, and we'll open up… our entire bodies. - It'll be a very intense workout… - Hello! You're still up. - Yeah, well. I was about to go to bed. - Hm. - How was your interview? - Cool. The lady was really nice. And she loved my résumé. - Hm. I bet they'll call you. - Mm. Yeah. How was your day? - Good. - Yeah? Good, super busy. - Could you get past the taxi drivers? - Yes. You smell like mint. Hm... Wow, I'm wiped out. - Are you coming? - Yeah, I'll be right there. Ugh! Aah! Val? When will you know about the museum job? - What? - When will you know about the museum job? Tomorrow or the day after. It would be great for us. ♪ Oh, it's too easy ♪ ♪ We're already bored ♪ ♪ But we leave every party the last ♪ ♪ Just like before ♪ ♪ We're so young in old places ♪ ♪ And we have nothing But our young faces ♪ ♪ And the world is sick ♪ ACCOUNT BALANCE ♪ Sick and closed Since hundreds of years ♪ ♪ Red neon in the streets ♪ ♪ Strangers will never meet ♪ ♪ Was it worth it? ♪ ♪ Was it really worth it? ♪ ♪ Was it worth it? ♪ Was it really worth it? ♪ ♪ I don't know ♪ ♪ But something got stuck in our clothes ♪ Hold on. I'll give you the time right now. One second. But I don't know what time I'll be done. ACCOUNT BALANCE Come over here! Throw the ball! Give it to me! - I can't believe you bought something. - I'm gonna be an aunt, right? Blue? Well, pink is so conventional. Right. I told them it was going to be a girl. HE'S THE CUTEST Right, sure. I bet you didn't even remember. No surprise there. You haven't come over in a month. - You know I'm busy with my novel. - We have a name, and you don't even know. Coming from you, I bet it's intense, like Aphrodite or Pachamama. Damn. Hm. Get it all out now. Because once she's here… no more swearing. Uh... I'm gonna ask you a favor, but don't get mad. Okay? I need a loan. I… promise I will pay you back once I get published. Why don't you ask your husband? I've never asked for anything before. I'm not about to start. Val, get a job. - You've done nothing for four months. - It's my novel… I thought that... that I'd be done by now. - Come on, Rebe. - Don't call me Rebe… like when we were kids. You see? That's the problem. You think everything works like when we were kids. Mom and Dad gave you whatever you wanted. No. No, excuse me… I'd ask for something, and you'd get it. - Here we go again with the jealousy. - Look… You know I didn't pick an easy career. And I know you think my novel will suck because you never liked anything I wrote, but it will really suck if I get stressed about money in the last month of writing. I swear I'll pay you back. All right, look… you chose a lovely career. But… every artist needs a plan B. No, no. Don't even think about it. Tell your daughter… that this is from her aunt… the homeless artist. SHE'S THE CUTEST HAG - WITHOUT - HEART - BONFIRE - POVERTY DEATH - IMPOSTOR - FAILURE FRIENDS 4EVER - LOLA VAL, YOU COMING TO VÍCTOR'S THING? I'M FEELING PRETTY OFF CARMEN - IF IT'S A MONEY THING I GOT YOU LOLA - COME ON, FARTY! NEREA - ISN'T IT AN OPEN BAR? LOLA - FRESH AIR! NEREA - OPEN BAR? CARMEN - LET'S TAKE IT EASY TONIGHT "You have been selected for the security guard position." "I will reach out to you tomorrow." - All good? - Yup. Girls, the weirdest thing just happened. I was getting off the subway, and I saw this girl that looked exactly like me. Same body, same face, same hair, everything. Oh, and her bun was better than mine. So I kept staring at her, waiting for her to say something, but she wouldn't say a word. She didn't… I don't know. All right, you must think I'm crazy, but… I think it was actually me. I split in two to tell myself something, but I was just too scared and didn't say anything. Oh, I hope that was it and not that I was separated at birth from my twin sister, otherwise… Anyway, I'll let you go. I'm almost there. So get me a beer, please. No, no, no, no! Wait! - Carmen? - A gin and tonic, since it's an open bar. Want to get a drink? CARMEN - I'M FINALLY GOING OUT WITH BORJA! HALLELUJAH! NEREA - MISSED THE TRAIN. I'M NOT WAITING 50 MIN. I'M STAYING IN MORDOR, SORRY Bitches. - Hi, Juan! - Hey, Valentina. - Valeria. - Valeria, right. Shit. Sorry. You know, I think we should hang out more. I'd remember your name bett...

No, but we can grab a drink if you want… Just one drink. ♪ And I walk ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ ♪ In dirty air ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ ♪ And I walk ♪ Lola? ♪ Tonight ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ ♪ In a city that towers over ♪ ♪ Like a ghost ♪ ♪ I wear a glass armor ♪ VALERIA - WHAT THE FUCK, DUDE!

I made it here, so everything was fine. So I grabbed my suitcase and… …the captain said, "We ask the passengers to please remain calm." So people went nuts. - Shall I introduce you? - What? - Do you want me to introduce you? - No. - Are you sure? - I said no. No, Juan! I don't... - I'm Víctor. - ♪ In dirty air ♪ Ah! You're Víctor! Lola's mysterious friend, right? - And you are? - Valeria. The… writer. ♪ And I walk... ♪ No clue. Well, a friend of Lola's. - Where is she, by the way? - Banging her married guy, for sure. Should we have a drink while we wait? - No, thanks. I was just leaving. - Come on! Just one drink. I bet she gets here before we finish. Valeria is going to kill me. We won't see each other for two weeks. Bring me something from Buenos Aires. An empanada, at least. Can I text you? You'd better not. Marta will be breathing down my neck constantly. She's such a drag. Where are you going, looking that hot? Eh? - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. What do we have here? - No, don't start. - What's this? - Stop that. - I want it. - No. - Come on. It's mine! I've also been to Mexico City, Istanbul, New York… and I just got back from Berlin. - Nomadic lifestyle. - Nomadic blood, it runs in the family. So what brings you back to Madrid? I'm designing some passive houses. Passive houses? Apartments that barely consume any energy. Hey, just like me. I sit and write my novel for eight hours a day. - You don't look very sedentary. - No? No. You were about to run out of my party. Well, I travel in other ways when I write. Oh, yeah? Where to? Everywhere. And nowhere. What's it like? It's like having a movie projector in your head. Is it the same for you as an architect? Almost… but for me, it's more like… seeing… walls projected in my head. It's called "dream projection." It's nice that you project them in so many cities around the world. - You could write anywhere, if you like. - Not anymore. I just got a job at a museum. Mm. - Doing what? - Security guard. Ah, okay. Perhaps you don't want the job, and would rather write your novel? Yes. Can I give you some advice? Sure. Do it. Don't take the job, and do what actually fulfills you. Feeling regret is better than thinking "what if." What are you doing tomorrow? Going to the movies with… my husband. Seriously? ♪ Can we finish what we started? ♪ Well, you don't seem very excited. ♪ I wanna see this through... ♪ You're kind of a dick, aren't you? And you… what are you? I'm an impostor. Everyone thinks I'm finishing my novel, and I haven't even written ten pages. Don't laugh! I have writer's block. - I think I have impostor syndrome. - Impostor syndrome? - Yes. - Mm. It's when you're not as smart as you think you are. - Right. - Hm. What if you write about what you have inside? Nobody cares about what I have inside. I do. Right. All right, we need to fix this. What makes you happy currently? That unicorn T-shirts are in again? There it is. You could even write a trilogy about unicorns. But really. Do you have time to scrap those ten pages and start over? I don't have time for anything. Don't take that job. You'll find another one. Finish your novel. That will actually make you happy. Drink. - Why? - Just drink. Hm! Are you happy in your marriage? Married six years? Wild sex every day. There it is. - What? - Your novel. Sex sells. You need to write an erotic novel… about your unhappy sex life. Hey, I didn't say I had a sex life that's… Fine, then about the happy sex life… you'd like to have. Holy shit! What's going on here? Really? One o'clock? I just came to say hi. There's this Belgian exchange student waiting for me at the door. - Are you a bit tipsy? - Weren't you with Sergio? All true statements. What were you saying about my friend's sex life? She is married! You guys are so cute. …I didn't know they were so heavy! - Right. - Aah! Why did I tell you all my problems? I'm going to regret it tomorrow. - Well, feeling regret is better... - Sure, than thinking "what if." How about a nightcap? Uh... No, I gotta go. Well, bye. Impostor. Bye, dick.
