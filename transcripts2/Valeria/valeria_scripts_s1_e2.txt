 - Look, I have this mortgage... - Yeah... ...that covers you... up to 80%. The interest rate is... fixed. Yes. I think it could work for you.

Erotic novel. Wasn't it a thriller? Yeah, well... Luckily, I realized that sex sells. I love it! So, like 50 Shades? My mom loves that! Not exactly. At least this is literature. Right. I hope you're luckier than that girl over there with the blue hair. She's a writer too, but unpublished. - Really? - Mm. Poor thing! Hey! I've got a great idea! - Why don't you present your novel here? - Well... Come on! We can put a table and mic here. The chairs, right over there... 2. SIGNS - And the audience can sit... - Okay, hold on, Cris. I think the presentation will be at FNAC. - Mm. - Right... - Yeah. - Of course, you're right. Silly me. - But a book signing would be awesome! - Yeah? - Yes. - I love the idea. - I'll run it by my boss. Okay? - Okay. They looked into each other's eyes. Their naked bodies were... SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, NOT TO IMPRESS OTHERS VÍCTOR - HI, IMPOSTOR! DID YOU TAKE MY ADVICE ABOUT THE EROTIC NOVEL? I SEE YOU AS THE MAIN CHARACTER YOU'LL HAVE TO READ IT TO SEE IF... I WENT FOR A ROMAN HISTORY NOVEL ♪ Are the walls getting closer ♪ ♪ As I'm getting closer to you? ♪ Hello... I know it's a work day, and you all have real jobs with shitty hours. But I need you to read at least the first chapter, before I send the draft to the publisher. It's only 15 pages. Nothing crazy, really. I think it's pretty good. I haven't felt this good writing for ages. It just all came flowing out! Probably because of the erotic turn it's taken. But none of that 50 Shades bullshit. My story's about real sex, with real women, like us. ♪ Lucky girl, I'm a lucky girl ♪ ♪ I'm a lucky girl ♪ As we all know... ...their contact with other members of their own species, thus reducing biodiversity. Let's analyze... Let's focus on Brazil. So if you see yourselves anywhere in the novel... don't be surprised, okay? Especially you, Lola, because, as you can imagine, you're a huge source of inspiration. All right, let's meet up later so you can read it, please! ♪ Lucky girl, I'm a lucky, lucky girl ♪ ♪ I'm a lucky girl, I'm a... ♪ Another consequence of our misconduct is the alteration of the food chain of many species. Thank you so much. I love this new kinky writer thing you've got going on. I'm in for the reading. Come on, don't be shy! I'm not eating tuna. But it's your favorite. Yeah... but I feel bad. Did you know bluefin tuna are on the brink of extinction... and we're destroying their food chain? Damn, sister. That fucking blows. Then... we'd better make the most of it... before it becomes extinct. You're such a dumb ass! Go wash up. You... troll! Don't call Dani a troll. He's my little louse. - Dad! - Louse! Give me strength. He starts the new therapy tomorrow, right? Ahh... Yup. What's wrong? They called to tell me that he can't go alone. How come? So we can learn how to do the exercises so he can do them at home. But what about your classes? They're going to send a bus to pick us up every day, but I won't have days off until August, so... - You can't make it. - No, I can't. Lola... Uh... your mother called the other day. She'll be in Madrid for a while. I might ask her to come sooner, to help us out. - What do you think? - Unbelievable! - What else can I do? - Hello! Ask me! You? No, no, no. You have enough on your plate with your job and stuff. No. Besides, like it or not, she's his mother. - And yours. - Here we go again. She's not! That woman walked out when she saw being a mom was hard. - Well, she's apologized many times. - And you believe her? - Lola, I can't take him. - So I'll do it! I'll find time somehow. You bet I will. For fuck's sake. Don't call her "Mom." She's... "that lady." Look... I don't care if she takes me to the clinic one day. But I do. Lola... Lola, look at me. It's just that... You don't need to deal with my shit. But, you know... I'd rather you took me. I know, dummy! I'd get up to give you a hug, but I can't. You've got some nerve! Lola, stop. Leave that. Lola, can you stop? - Lola, stop! - Hey! Here we go... If you were trying to steal my roommate's perfume, you screwed up. This is mine. You're really into Zaida, aren't you? Lola, seriously, stop with the cloth! I don't know why I took it. I just liked the smell! - Seriously. - You're such a liar! - A liar? - Look at me and say you don't like Zaida. ♪ You can't go to the beach ♪ ♪ Not enough water ♪ ♪ You can't open the window ♪ ♪ There's no air outside the bungalow ♪ ♪ They didn't mention it ♪ ♪ On the brochure ♪ ♪ Got trapped here when I moved ♪ ♪ Five years ago ♪ ♪ Mars is no fun ♪ ♪ Mars... ♪ Babe, that really turned me on! - Yeah? - Really, I loved it. I told you so! Well? - Good... Interesting. - Really? Sure, it has... it has twists. Can you send me the rest? - I'm hooked! - You really liked it? - Yes! - Yeah. Oh, that's great! It's not Game of Thrones. You've been at it for half an hour. Done. It's good. But? - No "but." - I know you. Spit it out. I don't know, I thought I would... relate to it more, since you said... The sex isn't real enough. What do you mean by real? Do you come every time you fuck? - You? - Well... You don't count. You're a lesbian. - Carmen... - I've played the part too. Okay? See? Even lesbians fake it! It's all too perfect. It lacks... truth. Sure, but this is fiction. Yes! I don't wanna read about my own problems. - Exactly! - I have enough of my own! I disagree entirely. I'd add more personal stuff. We have the material. Want some ideas? I promise I'll think about it tonight. I thought you liked it. I did, but maybe you want to change some things before sending it. - Fine. - But it's really good, Val. It really turned me on. Of course! The Jane Austen of sex! I can see it now... Sense and Sensibility in your pussy! Val, it's really good. - Is it? - It is. Girls, let's get the check. I have to go get my brother. How's Dani? Let's see how the new therapy goes... but, hey, it's still spina bifida. I'll have more time once I submit the novel, if you ever need me to go with him. Thanks, sweetie, but I think I'll manage. - You sure? - Yes. Family sacrifices, right? That's all I do. I mean, I was at the office until 12 last night. Just talk to your parents! It's not that easy... You guys have siblings and husbands... I don't have any of that. If I quit my job or come out, I'll be alone. Ah! - Dude! I come here every day! - Oh, my God! Sorry, babe. I just... I don't think beer agrees with me. Take it away. - Shall I? - Yes! - What's the waiter's name? - No idea. Ooh! Cradle snatcher... I'm like Val's main character. Polyamorous... and multiorgasmic. I wish I was like her protagonist. Have you seen Borja again? Ah... Did I miss something? Carmen asked him out again. He said he was busy. The end. He's always busy! He's so not interested. Or maybe he's actually busy. Girls... ciao. - OK. Talk soon. - Yeah. Ciao. Another round? I love your domestic installations. The world's missing out on a great artist. I'll talk to the Reina Sofia Museum and see if they can fit me in. The artist's starting to feel a little harassed. Rolled-up clothes turn me on. Marie Kondo would be very proud of you. Val, wait. - Are you okay? - Yes. But you're not in the mood. Men aren't always in the mood. - You're never in the mood! - That's not true. I'm not going to argue. I'm busy. ♪ Recuerdo que al llegar ni me miraste ♪ ♪ Fui solo una más de cientos ♪ ♪ Y, sin embargo, fueron tuyos ♪ ♪ Los primeros voleteos ♪ ♪ Cómo no pude darme cuenta ♪ LATER NOW TOO LATE? ♪ Que hay pecados compartidos ♪ ♪ Y que tú estabas tan cerca ♪ ♪ Me disfrazo de ti ♪ Good morning. ♪ Te disfrazas de mí ♪ You fell asleep right when it started. You've been out for ten hours. Oh. Sorry. You didn't miss much. Fat Leonardo DiCaprio is depressing. I wasn't talking about that... I meant about last night. - Last night? - Hm. Mmm. Ah. The unsuccessful blow job... I'd forgotten all about it. It's work, Val. What if this is my moment, and I'm wasting it on millennial bullshit? One... you're a millennial. And two... it's a yoga channel. It's not like, "Hi, I'm some loser!" Well, that would be more fun. I feel like doing something more creative, more my style, documentary photography. - You know I'd love to go to Georgia. - Yeah, Georgia. I'd like to get my own material together and put on an exhibition. I'm tired of doing things for other people. I'd take that gig, film in "yogi land"... and make a fortune. Then we'll both live off our art, die young... and be remembered for our work. We're both really talented. You're the most talented person I know. Thanks. Mm. I'll just hop in the shower. Hm! Sorry, babe. I don't even have time to find my keys. - What's up, man? - Hi. The conference shouldn't last more than... three hours. It's chill, dude. I'll watch him. I'm not a fucking baby. I wish someone would take me everywhere. Hey, watch it! Come on... I mean in a fucking car or something. Your situation just sucks. - You get it, right? - I'm going. - Behave. - Yeah, or I'll slash a tire. Fine. We'll fix it together. You want anything? It's early, but I'm always up for a beer. Sure. Did your sister tell you I'm going to New York? On vacation? I'm moving there... to make trap music. Here, people don't get a girl talking about money and dicks. It's a different vibe there. Check this out. It'll knock you out of that chair. She's the fucking trap queen. Rosalía? You have no idea. Ready to have your mind blown? Your sister lets you drink beer, right? ♪ Si no te vuelvo a ver ¿Qué seráde mí? ♪ ♪ Bebé no te quiero perder ♪ ♪ Acércate suave, yo te quiero tener... ♪ I love doing it here. This is the last time you show up at my work unannounced. I suggested your place, but... you didn't want to. - Wait. Wait, wait. - What? From now on... we'll do it when I say so. Oh, yeah? Did I miss something? No. But I have a life too. ♪ Lo que hay entre tú Y yo no se puede comparar ♪ ♪ Dale déjate llevar Papi esto es de verdad ♪ ♪ Dale déjate llevar De-de-déjate llevar ♪ ♪ Nunca sabremos lo que pudo pasar ♪ ♪ Esto me come por dentro Necesito comprobar ♪ ♪ Tú sabes que eres mío Y que te arrepentirás ♪ ♪ Papi sabes que eres mío Y que te arrepentirás ♪ Shit!

I've got the perfect frame now... I can't. Right, but it feels a bit invasive. Sure... but the camera has to be here. Hm? Trust me. I've got experience doing... this shit. I mean, it's not shit. - I meant to say... - No, no, no, no. So... how would you do this "shit"? Well... first I'd take an establishing shot. - Mm-hm. - Then you start doing your... your "poses" and... stuff. We'd do it multiple times, so I could get some close-ups. Right, but... there aren't any close-ups. This is a yoga class, not... Sundance. - Right... - Adri, look. This is really simple. I've had my channel over five years, and I know perfectly well which shots work for me. So first make my followers happy, and then you can make... art films. Okay. Slow down. I'm gonna puke. Well, hold it in! Maybe that way you'll sober up! I'll tell Zaida about this later. - I'm not drunk. - Ma'am! I'd kill for one of those! Is that... our bus? Oh, God! No, no, no, no! No, no! Shit! Fuck! - Val, I'm going to grab your laptop. - Okay!

VÍCTOR - HI IMPOSTOR! DID YOU TAKE MY ADVICE ABOUT THE EROTIC NOVEL? I SEE YOU AS THE MAIN CHARACTER TOOK YOUR ADVICE ABOUT THE EROTIC NOVEL. SEEING MY PUBLISHER TODAY Babe, I'm leaving. - So, are you nervous? - No, not really. Don't forget to mention the book signing here. - You got it. - Okay? Bye! Ciao! "Pretending is a way of lying in life." Hi. An hour and 27 minutes. I need to have a little chat with the mayor about public transport. No worries. My meeting is in an hour. - All right, let's go over it. - Okay. You have to be confident. You handed in the draft. Now you have to defend it. Do you think coming is that important? - What? - I think it is. - Um... - I can't stop thinking about it after what Lola said about the novel. Is this about the novel or Adri? Don't worry if you don't come. It happens to everyone. But faking it regularly... I hate it. And if you do it once, you're toast. I was talking about the novel. Me too. Okay, let's focus on the meeting. Yes. Okay, it's important... Ay. I'm meeting Carmen to view an apartment. So... This report has the key points about your contract and some parts on distribution, rights and publicity. - Okay. - When the publisher has one drafted, - she can send it and we'll talk. - Thanks so much! - Okay? - Okay. Good luck. Thanks. Tell the girls I said hi. Shit, I'm never going to make it. Don't worry. You're not missing much. Seriously... the three of us wouldn't fit. Look on the bright side... less to clean. Ow! Uh... Turn the camera off, will you? Chill, Carmen. There are plenty of apartments in the sea. So? I'm gonna need a physical therapist for my back. - Then I can't afford rent! - How much do they want for it? - Eight hundred. - Eight hundred! But it's only 215 square feet! Well, that's what they'd make renting it to tourists. Seriously? Borja won't fit, even if we bring him in sideways. Borja? Yes... and yes, I know we're never going to live together because we'll never be together, so, whatever! No need to justify yourself. You're still hoping he proposes. Can you please turn off your phone? No. Let's see, pros and cons. - Okay... - There are no pros! This apartment is tiny and overpriced! Besides, if you're single, you're doomed to live with your parents or share a place until you're 40. What's wrong with that? Well, the world... is made for couples. Look at Snapchat. Now... all of their filters are for two people! And you know what? I hate... I hate all couples. Grr! Hey! How do you think Valeria is doing? This is fucking garbage. And I'm doing you a favor, being this honest. Tell me, Valeria... what do you want to do? Right now, jump off the Segovia Bridge. Then, I don't know. We'll see. Look... you've got spunk, talent. But this isn't an erotic novel, sweetheart. It's science fiction. How old are you? Twenty-eight. I bet your life is far more interesting than the main character's. It's disgusting how perfect she is. If I had to write about my life, it'd be another boring short story. Perfect, write it. But make it real. Make it your own. No... No... No, no, I can't. Writing about myself... is fruitless. What are you afraid of? Realizing I'm not good enough. I need a sign, something to... to tell me I was born for this. There's only one way to know that for sure. - Writing? - Yes. But not here. - Chus, please... - I'm out of time, Valeria. Your draft was late and now this. - But I swear... - I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry.

Having your feet touched feels so good! Some people hate it, but I love it. I'd love to be touched, period. Damn, Carmen. You have to fix this, now! How? Borja's ignoring me. So, ignore him. He's not the only guy in the world! - That's what I'm saying. - Here. I'm going to create a profile for you on a site full of Borjas. - Yeah, do it! - No, no, no! Hook-up apps, dude? No way. You know I like long-term relationships. Look, a long-term relationship here means banging the same guy twice! Twice. Nerea, do something. Please! Nope. Try changing the subject. Nerea has a profile too. Smile! - What? - Awesome shot. Don't you dare put that as my profile picture! - Too late! - She did the same to me. Let's see... that's it. We're ready. No... receding hairline. OK, swipe left. Ankle-length pants? Hell, no. So what? You'll take them off. Fine, left. Hey! A climber! - No. Climbers, no! - No. Climbers, yes. No, no climbers. Can I please have my phone back? - No. - Lola! Don't move. Match! Last online two hours ago. She might be celebrating with Adri. - I don't think so. - It's odd she didn't say anything. Right. Let's throw her a surprise dinner for all of her hard work. - Yeah! - Okay. Just tell me in advance, so I can plan my time, please. I'm going home. I have to change. I'm meeting Sergio. You didn't rush to see my apartment today... Knock it off. You always say you wear the pants, but clearly it's Sergio who does. If he calls, you drop everything. Yeah, all of the things. You have no idea. Well, ciao... - Crybaby. - Ciao. Oh, man... SERGIO - MISSED CALL Psst. Shall we? The movie already started, but... that won't matter. I don't think I'm up for it. Even better. Let's go home. No, I'm going alone. What are you talking about? It's fine if you want to take the lead. No problem. But if you make plans, at least show up. This is the first time, and I didn't even stand you up. I won't wait an hour for a hand job at the movies ever again. But it's okay if I wait in a park for you to touch me and then run off. - You're not in another relationship. - No, I have other things. That's twice you've said that today. - What things? - Things. I don't have to tell you. Then maybe... we're not as compatible as we thought. I don't want to stop seeing you. We're two animals on the brink of extinction. We can't disappear. I don't want us to disappear either. But we have to find a way to make this work. At least for me. MARTA, BABY! LUCHANA THEATERS Val? Val? How did it go with the publisher? Honey, you're soaked. Hey, it'll be okay. There, there. Hop in the shower. I'll make you a hot drink. Then you can tell me all about it. Hm? Why are you so good? What? It's true. You're the best person I know. And I'm the worst. What are you talking about? My novel's shit. They're not going to publish it. What do I do now? It'll be fine. No, really. What do I do? I don't have a job. I only have 50 euros in the bank. I really messed up! Val, you did what you had to do. That's all there is to it. - Just trust yourself. - No. No. I should have taken the job at the museum and not pretended to be something else. You told me the museum didn't hire you, right? You lied to me? So, you tell me to work for the YouTuber for the money... you say my time will come, and you do the opposite? I told you, I'm the worst. Unbelievable! I told you that because I thought my novel would work out. - You've got some nerve! - "Some nerve"? You're one to talk! You asked me to push back the novel and take the museum gig, like you always do. What do I do? Encourage me to take shitty jobs and quit writing. I've never asked you to do that. You never asked me not to. You don't have a job. You're not getting published. Now what? You'll spend two weeks in bed doing nothing like always? You want to lecture me on doing nothing? We watch a movie, you fall asleep. I just touch you, and you run away! - Am I that boring? - No, Val. You're not! I'm just sick of things never working out for you. You know what I was writing? An erotic novel. And you know why they tossed it? Because it all sounded fake. Because I had to search for "sex in your thirties" online. For fuck's sake. If I don't go to you, you won't touch me. This afternoon doesn't count? No, sweetheart! Of course not! Do you really think anyone can come in 15 seconds? You faked it. ♪ Sé que hay cosas que me digo ♪ ♪ Que no tienen que pasar ♪ ♪ Se despiertan del olvido ♪ ♪ Vuelven pa' hacerme llorar ♪ ♪ Yo me quedaría contigo ♪ ♪ Una, dos, tres noches más ♪ ♪ Si no hubiera roto el hilo ♪ ♪ Ojalá, volver atrás ♪ ♪ No te culpo de mi pena ♪ ♪ No te culpo de mi mal ♪ ♪ Te construiré un castillo ♪ ♪ Con tu lágrima de sal ♪ ♪ Te cuidaba como un niño ♪ ♪ Que no sabe caminar ♪ ♪ Déjame que te proteja ♪ ♪ De lo que pueda pasar ♪ ♪ Dame paz y dame guerra ♪ ♪ Dame aliento, cuídame ♪ ♪ Clavelitos en tu pelo ♪ ♪ Los tatuajes de tu piel ♪ ♪ Hoy supura y supura ♪ ♪ Lo que ayer sabía a miel ♪ ♪ Yo maldigo a mi cordura ♪ ♪ Palomita, llévame ♪ ♪ Dame paz y dame guerra ♪ ♪ Dame aliento, cuídame ♪ ♪ Clavelitos en tu pelo... ♪ VALERIA - WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
