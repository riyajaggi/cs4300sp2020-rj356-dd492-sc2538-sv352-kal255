That's why I want to take it slow. Are you Opus Dei? I am not Opus Dei. I'm not. I've hooked up with tons of chicks, fucked on the first date and... Get to the point!

Why doesn't he want me? 3. ALASKA What am I missing? Actually, what's extra about me? Carmen, he said he likes you. A lot. Why are you stressing? If he liked me as much as he says, we'd have fucked already, right? Wasn't Lola coming? She had to go home, drop her brother off, shower... She was too busy. What's new? How's it going at the museum? I don't know... I look at that rock and think, "Is this really all life has to offer?" Come on! Just because one publisher said no, doesn't mean they all will. Think of the museum job as temporary. They added me to the group chat. It feels permanent. At least it's 30 degrees cooler in the museum. Come with me. Come on! - Where are you going? - Come on! Excuse me. - Oh! - Ah, yes! - Yes, please! - God, this is so nice! Oh! - Right there. - Phew! - Whoo! - What if you were Beyoncé? She's not missing anything. You're perfect the way you are, dude. You're fucking dope. I bet Borja's crazy about you. Fine, but how can he hold back? I was practically topless. - Well, sometimes that's fun too. - Really? Of course! VÍCTOR - 102 DEGREES, WANT TO SHOWER WITH ME? Waiting, flirting, that whole game... can be even sexier than sex. - Aah... - Oi! Oh, no! - What if he's gay? - Now you say it, he dresses well. Oh, Carmen, that's ridiculous. My boyfriend dresses well too. For fuck's sake! Women always complain that dudes only want sex. But when one doesn't... well, he's gay. Wow... I gotta remember this shit. I don't know how you can talk about fucking in this heat. What do you mean? Heatwaves really turn me on. Anyone have a pool in their building? I do. I meant on colonized land, Nerea. I bet your parents would make us wear water wings. Well, I am not wearing a bikini this summer. We can't convince you you're hot, can we? Can we convince you not to give up on your novel? Leave me alone. Take a break and go back to it after the summer. No, I've accepted my fate is to guard that rock. I gave it a name. Antonio. What do you think my fate is? Damn, Carmen! You're such a drama queen! You just need some "fast food" to help you relax. I don't want a one-night stand. I want... something more. - More? - Yes, more. Relationships always fall apart, dude. Why are open relationships so popular now? It's the only way to make it... last. In conclusion... forget about him. Find a normal guy. Or better still... lots of normal guys! "Normal" how? Like, "Let's fuck in the bathroom now. I can't wait until we get home!" Stop it! Well, that was a bit sexist, wasn't it? So, normal guys can't keep it in their pants, but if we want it we're crazy? Coming from you, Lola... - You're right. - Mm. Well, I don't get it. You've made it the total opposite with this whole fucking "me too" thing. Now it's cool to play the victim. We are victims! I know, but why didn't women report it before? What the fuck? Now you're telling us when to report it? No, but not all the cases are true. Sure, because women love making this stuff up so everyone can judge us. Since the dawn of time... producers have slept with actresses, - and no one said a word. - Ssh. - Power is erotic. - No, that's abuse of power! What the fuck are you talking about? Look... How many of you... have fallen for or been into your boss? - Or a professor? - Not me. Well... Carmen was nuts about her sociology professor. - Remember? - Yes, but he was the only one under 60! - You see? It's you! - Fuck that! That you again! See? That's the problem. We always have to justify everything we do! It doesn't say that anywhere in the constitution. What about them? That teacher or that boss... They'd never get those girls if it weren't for their position of power. Now that's fucked up. Screw someone who sees you as an equal, damn it! Or you're a piece of shit! - Totally! - Well said! - Nerea for president! - Bravo! Whoo! Hey, Nerea. Did Carmen tell you I work for a feminist association? It would be amazing to have a lawyer come in. You could come give a talk or give us some legal advice. - Me? - Yeah. Nah, I'm just tipsy, and it's only nine o'clock! Nine? Nine! Oh, fuck! Shit! Um... Ciao! Talk soon! Okay... Did she leave without paying? The house is amazing. You should come visit. It has tons of light... - The neighborhood's quiet... - That's great. The birds wake us up. Guys, we can order if you like. No, no, no, no, no! We can wait. Let's wait! She can't be much longer, right? I feel bad making you wait... Don't worry! You can give me all the juice on our ex-boss's yogi niece! Please tell me she's as weird as he is! Is she into those weird poses? - Well... - Sorry, sorry! - Hey... - Sorry! - Look who it is! - I was with Carmen and the girls. Poor thing was having a crisis. - Gorgeous! - Yes! Thank you! I lost track of time, sorry. It's okay. We already spoke to the manager to see if he'd let us spend the night in the fridge. Packed in next to the crab sticks! - Have you ordered? - No. - No. - No. We were waiting for you. Right... Babe, how about we share the pork fillet? - Come on. - No! Bikini body diet. I have to fit into swimming trunks... this size! - You look great, babe. - No, no, no, no, no. - No red meat today. - Ay! - We're going to Ibiza next week. - Really? - Yes. - Lots of sun... a sweet hotel, lots of hot men running around... It's going to be great! Ah, okay! You have an open relationship. What? Uh... No, I mean, you seem so happy... What? Nothing. Forget it. I misunderstood, sorry. Honey... not all gays listen to Cher and have open relationships. Ah. Okay, let's make a toast! - Sure. - Yes. - Okay. - To you two. The happy couple... aren't you coming up on six years? - Six? - Yeah! Any plans? - Yeah! - No. We don't know yet. We can barely decide what to order for dinner, so imagine! Okay, so... - Let's see... - Mmm! All right. Let's share the salmon tartare. And a salad. Can you eat that? Okay. You don't mind? No, I'll get my red meat later... You're so silly. So, what about us? That table ordered the mango and foie gras salad. It looks great. No, not foie gras. What? You lovefoie gras. I saw a documentary on how they fatten up the ducks. No way. It's awful. Well... then take off the foie gras, and I'll eat it. - No big deal. - You don't give a fuck about ducks? - Let's have more wine... - Yeah. Duck-fuckers. "Duck-fuckers"... Huh. - What are you doing? - Screw the duck! Fighting over foie gras? That's where we're at? No, Val... I don't know where you're at. What about you? You're so sure about everything. - So you want an open relationship? - What? You said so at dinner. You think that's why they're happy. Because... they have an open relationship. Well, I don't know. Lola says everyone's doing it now. Maybe you're the one... who wants an open relationship. That's what you want? It never even crossed my mind. - Sure... - "Sure" what, Val? You're the one who's obsessed with trying new things. - But not that, damn it! - We haven't talked in days. Clearly we're going through a rough patch. Maybe we should take a break. If you want a break, let's just get divorced. I need time to think. Maybe that's the problem! You think too much, but don't know what you feel. What do you feel? How about we let this rest for a couple of days? We'll talk about it later. ♪ Quiero evitar la baldosa ♪ ♪ Que baila y va y me pisa ♪ ♪ El pié el invierno ♪ ♪ Tú me dirás Que son cosas que pasan ♪ ♪ Así como pasa esta otra ambulancia ♪ ♪ Voy a quitar todas estas zetas ♪ ♪ Del sopor que te infunden mis letras ♪ VÍCTOR - ONLINE ARE YOU WORKING SUNDAY? ♪ La próxima vez que levantes las cejas ♪ ♪ De incredulidad ♪ ♪ Que sea al mundo ♪ ♪ Y no a mí condición de aturdido... ♪ WHAT DO YOU THINK OF FOIE GRAS?

Only 850 a month, plus a bank guarantee, six months' deposit and this month's rent. Right, and... Where is it? - What? - Um... Everything. You know, the kitchen, bedroom, those kinds of things. This is a flex apartment. Look... - Here's the kitchen. Fully equipped. - Mm-hm! And here's the bedroom. The bed is... very comfortable. Mm-hm. And... and the bathroom's over there? You have to walk over the bed, okay. Uh... If you agree in less than 24 hours, you'll get a deal. Only two months' deposit! Um... I need to think about it a bit more. Sure. I know it seems weird at first, but... it's just... different. It has its own style... character... personality. That's what makes it special. Like you. Hm? Well... yeah. I mean, the... the apartment certainly is... - special. - It is. ♪ Eleven ♪ - Like you. - ♪ Ten, nine ♪ - ♪ Ignition sequence start ♪ - ♪ ¡Y grita fuego! ♪ ♪ Mantenlo prendido ¡fuego! ♪ ♪ No lo dejes apagar ¡Y grita fuego! ♪ ♪ Mantenlo prendido ¡fuego! ♪ Hi! - Hi! - Hello!

Are those new shoes? Mm. Yes. You like them? Well, it's just... You're bleeding. - There. - Oh! Uh... Yeah, uh... Okay. Hang on. I have a Band-Aid. Thanks. You were with Valeria yesterday, right? You had some beers... Well, she was late for our dinner date. So? After dinner, we started talking about... open relationships. What's the problem, Adri? That she was with me, that she was late, the open relationship thing or all three? Things are really shitty. Look... you've been together for years. It's normal for things to get bad. Yeah, but this bad? Val told me you believe in open relationships. - Are you considering it? - No! I don't know. I'm so lost, Lola. If things are bad, you're going to have to make a decision. Maybe open the relationship or adopt a dog. But when things aren't working, something needs to change. Look, girls... Víctor's just a guy who might become a friend, that's all. That's why I didn't mention it, because... it just sort of happened. Out of the blue! He's actually a really nice guy. And... he's really hot! CANCEL But nothing's going to happen! I know I'd really regret it. But... they say feeling regret is better than thinking "what if." Right? No. LOLA - WE NEED TO TALK ASAP WHERE ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? You caught me running away! - To Alaska? - Eh? Alaska was my idea. Are you a plagiarizer as well as an impostor? No talk of the novel I'm never going to write, please. I bet you'll write something your publisher will like. I don't know... Finding a good idea isn't that easy. That's why we're here. I remember you being taller. I remember you being less of a dick.

Is "twin" spelled with one N or two? Dude, one! Who even cares? I'll be rocking New York soon! "Soon," that's with two "O"s. Hey, has anyone heard from Valeria? She's missing, lately. She hasn't sent her podcast today. Sergio's really been missing lately. I miss his moaning. There's never a good time for both of us. - Aww. - Ooh. "Ha ha ha ha." Four "ha"s. "Ha ha." Just two? Check this out. "LOL." Is this guy still living in 2012? "It's just me in the photos. The thing is, I'm a Gemini, and I like to explore all my faces." - Ooh! - "What sign are you?" Holy shit! Now I know why you never get laid, dude! Not everyone plays by your rules. She's just trying to connect with me. Why? You spend hours chatting. Then you meet, and their breath stinks. Or they've got some food between their teeth, and... ciao! You've told them your life story for nothing. I know you don't, but I miss fucking before talking. That's true. - Holy shit! - Dick pic? No, idiot! No. it's the guy renting the place I saw this morning. - All right! - He used the word "special." - To describe you or the apartment? - Both. - He's so hot! - Right? He's gorgeous. Swipe right. Swipe right. No, no, no. He'll think I'm interested. Um... yeah. That's how it works. What if I send him a message asking about the place? Something... friendly. - Then he'll think you like... the place. - No, it's just an excuse. He'll get it. He's both hot and smart. - Swipe right! - Message. Wow, look at her! - Give it here. - No. No! - No, no, no! No, no! - Don't "no" me. No. No. No... Lola. Lola! Done. I knew this was the place for you. In fact... I'm really happy to have you as my tenant. So, should we celebrate? - How? - Well, we could either... smash it against the wall or drink it together... I guess. What do you prefer? - ♪ Mantenlo prendido ¡fuego! ♪ - Uh... The thing is my girlfriend's waiting for me downstairs and... We could celebrate another time, like when we get the utilities turned on. Wait. I don't understand. What? What? It's just... I saw you on this, and I thought that... that maybe you... - I keep forgetting to delete that app. - It's fine. Well, darn! Hang on... Did you take the place just to hook up with me? What? - Eh? No! - Yes. - No! No, no. - Yes. No, absolutely not! No, this place... I... - You? - I love it! - Yeah? - Yeah, I love it. It's... very me. - It's so... - So what? So... so... empty. What a relief! That's great, then. I mean it's great you like the place, not that you feel empty. Well, then... - All yours. - Thank you. One last thing, sorry. Where's the air conditioning? Uh, nowhere. But if you open the windows... - and the front door, you get a breeze. - Mm! Ciao. How the fuck did they get that in here? What are you doing? I can't have visitors. Or answer messages either? Lola, there are cameras! Okay, then, could you tell me where the gift shop is? Just a sec. My brother's parked outside. - What is it, Lola? - Adrián came to my house. - To your house? - Yes. Look. Let's say Adri is here, and he has no fucking clue where the exit is with you. - He mentioned the open relation... - I don't want that. Okay. The thing is, Víctor called me and said you were with him yesterday and... Uh... Hello? Am I missing something? Not at all. Nothing happened and nothing will. This is Víctor. Something always happens. - You really are into him. - What? No, I'm not! Look. He's my friend and I love him, but I love you more. When Víctor wants something, he'll do anything to get it. And I think he really wants you. - Oh, come on! - Valeria. Lola. Miss, the exit is over there. The exit is in there. That's where it is. Alicia, whenever you're ready, please. Is everything okay? Why? Does my aura need cleansing or something? No, man... Here. Sorry... I'm not having the best day. Well, I know how we can make it better. Come with me. Come here! Inhale for three and exhale for three. No, no, no. No, no, no. Slowly. Maybe Valeria is right. Who? Valeria, my wife. She says I think too much. - Ah. - Maybe I even forgot how to breathe. - How long have you been together? - Six years. The six-year crisis. - Sorry? - I'd been with Carlos for six years when I got pregnant. - But was it planned? - No, no, no, no. He didn't get me pregnant. It's not his or anyone else's. He didn't want kids, so I decided to do it on my own. - Seriously? - Mm-hm. Wow. The other day, we were talking about meeting other people. I didn't say yes or no. But I've been mulling it over, and I think... it's stupid. Why? I'm scared I'll come home to her one day, and she'll tell me there's someone better and leave. But maybe you'll be the one who meets someone more interesting. This isn't girl seeks boy. This is girl seeks boy or girl. How about Miranda Makaroff as the face of the brand? - Hmm... - Or is she a bit too old? No. We need other options. A girl willing to take initiative, who's not afraid of being seductive. - Something like that. - Sure. And she needs the perfume to feel secure? We could brand Fire like a charm, a guarantee of success. Imagine that the girl who uses it suddenly becomes a winner. Suddenly, she's better at her job, sports... She's guaranteed to get laid if she wears it out. Yeah, right! Come on. No woman... no matter how much perfume she wears, knows for sure if she'll succeed. You think you're in, and then you're not. But that's fine. If a guy doesn't like you, that doesn't mean you're not cool. The important thing... is that you like yourself. It's that moment, when you're home alone and you spray the perfume on your wrist and you feel fucking great! - I mean, it's just an idea. - Yes. I like it... That's the angle we want. How about make-up? - Did you have the meeting? - Yes. Carmen, I brought you a coffee. I'm sorry! Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What do you want? - Are you angry with me? - Look, I'm not angry with you. I'm angry with myself. Because I've had it... with seeing things that are never there, getting false hopes and always ending up fucking crushed. - I said I liked you. - Sure. - A lot. - Fine. But you left me hanging with some excuse. - It's not an excuse. It's true! - Right. I want to take it slow because... Damn it, I know what to do with a girl I don't really like, but not with you. Because, Carmen... I really do like you. Can you... say that again, please? I really like you. - That reeks! - Wow! God, you're right! Thank God you could drive us. Thanks, man! Did you see Val today? - Yes. - No. Give me a heads-up! What are my chances? You've got it pretty difficult, to be honest. I think she likes you. I think so too, but that doesn't give you the right to be hounding her all day. Madrid is full of women. None like Val, I know... but set your sights on someone else and leave her be, okay? Okay? Well, this is quite a foyer! Eh? Ah... No! I mean... This is it! Yeah, um... hold on. This is... the apartment! It's a flex apartment. Where's the fridge? Right here. - ♪ Ta-da! ♪ - What about the trash can? - Haven't picked a spot yet. - Ah, okay. - No. - Okay. I know, it's a shitty place, and it doesn't even have AC. So why would you rent it? Well, that's... a long story that wouldn't have happened if we'd fucked the other day. But don't worry about it. You know what? - Why don't you open this? - Mm-hm. And I'll... go and change my shirt in my room. - Oh, yeah! Sure. - Okay! - Okay. - Off I go! - That's your bedroom? - Um... yes! - This is my bedroom. - It's cool! - Yeah, it's lovely! - Mm. Can I just pop to the toilet? No, the thing is... Let me just get changed, then you can use the bathroom. Okay? Yeah? Okay.
