 The party theme is trap, not sadomasochism. I'd rather die from pain. I'm sure you'll love it once we're there. Sure, I'll end up twerking in some guy's face. That other party doesn't count! I'm not fucking any more guys! I want to fuck girls! All right, then... now the whole neighborhood knows. - If I don't get laid, I'm gonna lose it. - Oh! Aren't there any lesbians in Lidia's feminist association? You can't hook up there. I went a few times and didn't speak to anyone. If anyone noticed me... they didn't show it. So, then, make yourself noticed.

 4. THE POND Here, this is perfect for your C. Tangana costume. 50 bucks to look like some tacky guy? Can't I just wear a tracksuit? No way! Carmen and Borja are going as Beyoncé and Jay-Z. We need to top that. Carmen as Beyoncé and you as Rosalía? Wasn't it a trap music party? It's a "wear what looks best on me" party. I had to search "trap" online. What century are you from, man? I'd rather know about Leonard Cohen than trap. Come on, put this on... and rap. Okay, I'll try this on. - You're alive. - Uh... I thought you'd been abducted outside the gallery. Ah... Oh! Well, I've been really busy at the museum and everything... Hi. Hi. Uh, Víctor, Adrián. Other way around, sorry. - Hey. - How's it going? - How are things with your rock? - Uh... - Oh, you've been by? - No, not yet. But I can't wait. - To see the exhibition. - Uh... Yeah, me neither. Holy shit! When Zaida said we could find anything here... - we could find anything. - Hey! - You look stunning, by the way. - Thank you. So... we're going to pick my brother up. - Yeah. - Oh, right. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Sorry! Shit! - What is it? Ciao! What the fuck? He's seeing Lola, but he was hitting on you. Come on! They're just friends. - Oh, so he was hitting on you? - Eh? No, no! What are you talking about? He seems like an asshole. ♪ 'Cause I can't sleep without you ♪ ♪ No, I don't want to dream about you ♪ ♪ Wish I had my arms wrapped around you ♪ GOING - TURNING - RUNNING - FLEEING ♪ Insomnia ♪ ♪ Insomnia ♪ ♪ 'Cause I can't sleep without you ♪ ♪ No, I don't want to dream about you ♪ ♪ Wish I had my arms wrapped around you ♪ ♪ Insomnia ♪ - What about Córdoba? - The autonomous committees are divided into six groups that deal with social action, and four that handle political action. Then, at the provincial level, the 16 committees are divided as follows. Two in Huelva, three in Seville... Boring, right? My talks are much more entertaining. Really? What are your topics? Sexism and homophobia. I coordinate the LGBTI collective here at the association. Tomorrow we're meeting to organize a demonstration. Come. I promise you won't get bored. I'd like to, but I can't come every day. I live kind of far away. How far? Boadilla. My subway stop is Siglo XXI. Oh. Boadilla... Whoo! What a blast. You have no idea. I live and work with my parents. Right... You've never thought about splitting? I mean, from home. Sure, I've thought of everything, But I'm awful at speaking my mind. Don't think about it too much. Life's too short to be bitter all the time. And speaking your mind brings inner peace... So, which pond are you from? "Pond"? - A pond has stagnant water, right? - Mm-hm. Exactly. Well, lesbians always end up hooking up in the same circle. - So? - I don't have a pond. - We're your pond. - You're suggesting she hook up with us! - No, Carmen. - Look, girls. I have a problem. No pond means no sex. I need dyke friends! You can still get laid without a dyker gang. It's tougher since we just go to straight bars. That's a lie! We've been to Tsunami before, right? - Twice. - And I got more action. - Exactly. - I get it. It's normal that you want to do stuff in your scene. Well, it's not just about going out and getting laid. It's... - It's something else. It's... - Dude! Guess what? What? Sorry. Sorry! I thought you'd finished. - I'm sorry. - No... no worries. - Go on, go on. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Borja and I... rented a country cottage for Saturday! Nice! Finally! - Here's to future coitus! - Hold on. It could just be for a movie marathon. You jerk! The wait didn't even feel that long. So chastity works? - Yes. - Toast, already. Sure! Here's to a long, boring relationship! And to rough patches... Smoothed over, right? Rough patch? What rough patch? An open relationship isn't a bad idea. It just came up, but it's out of the question. IT'S OLGA. THIS IS MY NUMBER. Sure, and hanging with Víctor had nothing to do with it, right? Stop drinking! - Víctor? Lola's friend? - Yes! What... That's... No! Look! Time out. Give me a second. Adri and I had a rough patch. And in the middle of it all, I met Lola's friend, who's really nice, but nothing's happened, and nothing will, end of story! How are you guys now? I'm fine, really. I have a job. I can pay my bills. I love my husband, and I'm writing again. - The novel? - No. Stuff for the museum's website. I write event reviews, um, I edit stuff, I make sure the links work... I don't know. I like it. But... are you still in love with Adri? It's not that easy when you've been with someone for so long. But, yes! I love him... - I love him a lot. - Of course. Just make sure you keep surprising each other. Right? - I gotta go. - Wait, I'll go with you. No, I'm in a rush! - Are you seeing your needy pond? - They're not needy. - See you at the party. - Wait! - No, ciao! - Oh... - She won't stop seeing us, right? - Don't worry. She won't. She knows where her real pond is. We'll place the block... under the base of the skull... Never under the neck, to... avoid hurting ourselves. Shit. - What are you doing here? - Surprising you. - Who is it? - My wife, Valeria. - Ah! - I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, no, not at all! It's fine. We were rehearsing the live stream we're about to do. - What a lovely place. - Thanks! I'm Alicia, nice to meet you. Valeria. Adri said you're about to pop! Yes! I'm on the home stretch! What about you guys? Any summer plans? - A little getaway? - Well... Uh... I think we're gonna wait until September. It's cheaper to travel. - Yeah, that's better. - Ah. - Mm. - Of course. - Are you staying for the live stream? - Uh... Okay, sure. - There's tea there if you want. - Ah Uh...! I'm good, thanks. Whenever you're ready. Hi, everyone! Namaste. Thank you, once again, for giving me some of your time. And... Oh. Don't worry! It's been happening all day, but... Change of plan. How about we do the whole class standing up today? Let's get started. I'm going to need... someone to pick all this up. Adri? He's a bit shy. Come on. Thanks so much, Adri. He's a very talented guy. One day he'll go on to make... art films, but, for now... he's here with me. While Adri takes care of that, we're going to get into the tadasana pose. Let's close our eyes... Now we'll join our hands in front of our chest. Let's bring our attention to... our breath. Inhale... Exhale... Nice and smooth. NO WAY I'D NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT! THAT'S CRAZY! WOW! THAT'S AWESOME! DO IT AGAIN! What did you just do? Wow! What a great idea, Adri! #PUTANADRIINYOURLIFE The yogi-backpack! That's an amazing invention! ♪ No romance, I say ♪ Adri and I are fine. I love him. I don't know how, but I'm sure. So, Carmen, stay positive about Borja. I mean, butterflies at the start are great, but it's way cooler, after so many years... to have someone at home to give you a hug after a shitty day. Anyway, that's all. Ciao. VÍCTOR HAS NEW POSTS Can I help you? - Huh? - Yes, sorry. I'm looking for a black and red glittery suit - I saw yesterday... - Oh... - Someone just bought it. - Oh. We're not whores or servants! We're feminists! We're not whores or servants... We're always shouting the same thing! We need to be more original. I read there's been a rise in homophobic bullying in Madrid. We could focus on that. Let's think of an event and come up with some chants. Miriam, you're good at writing chants. No way! Last time, I spent a month writing rhymes and you never even learned them, bitches! If you want to attract attention, let's set some dumpsters on fire. And be compared to the patriarchy? Let's see... Are you all happy with us focusing on bullying? - Yes. - Awesome. Anyone want to write some chants? It's just that... I don't think shouting in the street changes anything. Why not? You haven't updated your social networks in a while. Hold on. It hasn't been that long. We got lots of followers from my live streams. Yeah, 50 followers! Are we really talking about followers? Hold on, Nerea's right. We don't do anything online, and it's a great way to reach more people. Social change happens on the street. You've had it too easy. No, my parents didn't make it easy for me. I wish they'd explained to me when I was little that if two women live together, they're not exactly just friends. Or that gender isn't only masculine and feminine, or that people have the right to love however the hell they want. Well... you all know that, but it'd be great to drive it home online. Okay, great. But let's try and be original. We could invent a powerful hashtag and try and get it to go viral. We could focus on teenagers, like Patricia said and... talk to... influencers. - Sure. - Okay. I think true stories would be better. - Right. - Well, I'm real. Okay, so hashtags and real life stories. Combined with talks in schools. - Perfect. - I'd love to help with that. I'll find people that will tell their story. - Awesome. - I'll go with you. And you could think of a hashtag for the next meeting... Okay? Sure. ♪ Ha sido tan divertido Habernos encontrado ♪ ♪ Ha sido tan divertido Que me hayas acogido ♪ ♪ Ha sido tan divertido Habernos disfrazado ♪ ♪ Ha sido tan divertido Reírnos de lo mismo ♪ ♪ Ha sido divertido Hacer mil planes juntos ♪ ♪ Ha sido divertido Que me hayas contagiado ♪ ♪ Ha sido divertido habernos insultado ♪ ♪ Ha sido divertido, sí ♪ Weren't we going to take a shower? ♪ Lo siento es lo único que puede decir ♪ ♪ Lo siento es lo único ♪ ♪ Lo siento es lo único... ♪ Don't you feel bad? We used up the whole city's water supply. It's shameful. There had been a long drought. Hey, hey. I have to go. But Marta's out of town. I'm having a party. Come for a drink. I can dress you up as Yung Beef. No idea who that is, but he sounds rough. Come on, stay! You'd be making my girlfriends so happy! I've got a work dinner. Maybe we can hang out another day... tomorrow? Sure! Netflix and chill with a hangover sounds great! We can carry on destroying the planet. Meeting your friends and watching a movie? What? That's normal, isn't it? Since when are you and I normal? Look... Marta is my partner. I'm already in a relationship. I'm not watching movies or meeting friends. I want to fuck. That's what we do. I thought we agreed on that, right? Of course. I don't want any confusion. I didn't ask you to be my boyfriend. And don't talk to me like that again. See? This is why it's better not to cross that line. Lola, I didn't want this. - Maybe we should stop seeing each other. - Yes. Don't worry about what Rocío said. She hasn't had it easy, but neither have we. I wish someone had told me about genders as a kid. Defining yourself is complicated. Well... I did my First Communion dressed in a sailor suit. I knew what I liked, just not what it was called. - I'm Noe. - Nerea. Nice to meet you. How do you define yourself now? - Genderqueer all the way! - And you? Me? I'm just your standard lesbian. Did you always know? Yeah, but I've always had straight friends. Right... Mine freaked out when I told them I was in a polyamorous relationship. - Really? - Mm. Yeah, I'm with two girls who are also with other people. Makes me nervous just thinking about it. It's no big deal. Don't you get jealous? We have rules. We tell each other everything. I think it's much healthier than a heteronormative relationship. I'm DJing at a bar tonight. - Want the details? - Yes! No, I can't. - Ah. - I've got a party... a trap party. ♪ Llevo días pensando en tu cuerpo ♪ - ♪ Yo sé que en realidad... ♪ - Ooh! ♪ Pero tampoco soy lo que parezco... ♪ Sure you want to go up? ♪ Que pueda presumir de lo que no tengo ♪ ♪ Te siento mía cuando En la cara me vengo ♪ ♪ Abre la boca para que le caiga adentro ♪ ♪ Por nada del mundo Cambiaría esos momentos ♪ ♪ Me siento suyo Cuando la digo lo siento ♪ ♪ Que ni yo soy tuyo, ni tu eres mía ♪ ♪ Me han dicho que tu pa Trabaja en comisaría ♪ ♪ Por eso si te lo hago Lo hago con alegría ♪ ♪ Porque es lo más cercano De follar a un policía ♪ ♪ Aún así, creo que... ♪ What's up with your brother and Zaida? What? Such a shame she's leaving, right? Have you started looking for roommates? Yes, I found one already! She's called Airbnb. I'm gonna make bank and go travel like everyone else, right? So... trap is mainly telling everyone to fuck off and saying bitch a lot. - Beer? - I've still got some. Give it here. ♪ Por si venía Por dentro ponía la llave ♪ ♪ Una vez tuve que salir por la ventana ♪ ♪ Sin calzoncillos Y dejándola empapada... ♪ Are you okay? Cool outfit! You look just like Rosalía. - Thanks! - But Adri... He looks ridiculous. What is he? An '80s rapper? Yeah, poor thing. Carmen is killing it. Have you seen her? She got the deposit back on her place to pay for that wig! Look at her! I hate them! I thought boring marriages were the best. - Where's Nerea? - Swimming in her pond. What's your problem? Wow! I don't believe it. Weren't C.Tangana and Rosalía hooking up? Really? No... I don't know. ♪ Llorando por dentro, sufriendo por ti ♪ ♪ Pero lo de tu padre ♪ - ♪ Eso no me deja dormir... ♪ - How are you? ♪ Qué estoy haciendo, va contra... ♪ Simone de Beauvoir making herself a rum and Coke! Thanks for inviting me, the girls are really nice. You're going to have a blast with us. - Carmen. - Yes? Nerea made a great impression at the association. - Oh, yeah? - She really clicked with them. Oh! - Seriously? There's no more ice. - No? - No! - I'll go get some. You coming, Beyoncé? - Shit, I did it myself. - It was a compliment, Lola. ♪ Mi corazón, bang bang bello Bello, bello ♪ ♪ Mi corazón, bang bang bello Bello, bello ♪ ♪ Mi corazón, bang bang bello ♪ ♪ Come on, baby, Muevelo, Muevelo ♪ - Nerea! - Hi, Juan. I was looking for you. - I wanted to ask about the other day. - Is it free? - Yeah. Uh... - I'm going in. ♪ Muevelo, Muevelo ♪ - ♪ Mi corazón, bang bang bello ♪ - See you in a minute. ♪ Mi corazón, bang bang bello ♪ ♪ Mi corazón, bang bang bello ♪ No... Yeah. ♪ Mi corazón, bang bang bello ♪ Lola. Have you seen my brother, Dani? The guy in the wheelchair. No? NOE - JUST IN CASE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND! XX LOCATION I'm really going to miss you. Come out to Brooklyn and eat me out every day. Don't stop! What the fuck are you doing? - You could've knocked! - It's my room! It's her goodbye gift. You're such an asshole, man. Why am I an asshole? Go on, tell me! I don't care. You're a big boy. Do whatever you want. Yeah? I need your permission to get laid? Do whatever the fuck you want! I already am. I asked Mom to come to Madrid. I want her to help with my therapy. - Is that what you want? - Yes. You know how much time I've wasted taking you to fucking rehab? My life's a mess because of you! It's not my fault your boyfriend left you. Get out. Come on, let's go get you a cab. - Looking for Lola? - Yes. She must have jumped out the window. That suit doesn't look bad on you. Thank you. We shouldn't be talking. You left me, remember? You cheated on me! Don't play the victim now. We would've been great together. We can still be friends. I'm thinking of moving to Barcelona. Are you going to record your next album in Catalan? I'm serious. But you were so happy with your passive houses. I leave places when there's no reason to stay. My company has offices in Barcelona. I just need to ask for the transfer. It's your call... There are too many tourists in Barcelona. Cultural diversity, I love it. - They have a weird language. - You're from Valencia. You won't find any interesting women there. If you mean... interesting women that work in a museum with a rock... you're right. I'm out of bad things to say about Barcelona. Good. Hi. I'm going to find Lola. - You could have told us. - Please... Sergio didn't dump me. So why did your brother say that? He's a brat. Lola, are you okay? What happened? - Sergio dumped her. - No one fucking dumped me! Lola, tell us. We're your friends. That's what we're here for. That's not exactly true. What? - That we're here for each other. - What are you talking about? You know everything about me, but you don't give a shit. That's not true! What's wrong with you? You always interrupt me, like my life's not important. That's not true. We listen to you. When you want advice. But when I need something... you ignore me. Sorry, I was with Borja. Can't you talk about anything else? You're the ones always asking about him! - No, she's right. - And you, Lola? Just admit you want someone to love you like everyone else! - True. - And you really like Víctor! It's obvious you and Adrián aren't okay. If you'd put that in the novel, it would've been more believable. - You said you liked it! - It was awful. What about you? You have your things. I'm going out with my lesbian pond. At least they listen. ...because maybe we have left her out a bit. - Well, then... - And we haven't listened to her enough... I just saw Tom Jones eating cake. Enough. Take him home, now. Please. It's no big deal. In that blue suit... I'm going to talk to Lola, okay? - I'll be... right back. - Yeah. - She was bottling it up. - Yes. She went off with her new friends. I'm exhausted. Me too. After I finish this, everyone can get the fuck out. Hey, you could've told me if I was annoying you all about Borja. Oh, no... Carmen, I can't deal with any more shit tonight. Please. Here, finish my beer. No. I'm not mixing that with the vodka in my system. Here... vodka for Beyoncé. Oh. Urgh. ♪ Esto es música para adultos Que no puedes comprender ♪ ♪ Como yo antes no podía comprender Así es ♪ ♪ Esto es música para adultos Que no puedes comprender ♪ ♪ Como yo antes no podía comprender ♪ ♪ He mirado a los ojos al sol ♪ Aah! Ah. Let's go. - Carmen, stop. You're getting me hard! - Aah! Well... So what? The country cottage has hydro massage, and I'll bring you breakfast in bed. There's a porch and lights that are more romantic than this... I don't need that. Fuck me or I'm gonna explode. Okay, okay. Let me get a condom. Of course, with a condom. Would you mind getting down? It'll be easier. Get down. - Oh, yeah. Sorry. - Ah! - Where are the condoms in this house? - I don't know! Here! Here! Who makes you more jealous? Forget it. Don't answer. It's great... that you're sticking with Adri. Deep down... I'd like to come home and... lay on the sofa and have someone hug me while I whine about my shitty day. I mean... not the same guy for 80 years... but I wouldn't say no to a bit of homely affection. What happened with Sergio? Remember how cool it was to be with a married guy? Well... it fucking sucks. I'm jealous over Víctor. I'm tired of pretending. You want another? Okay. - Hello. - Hi. Good thing I didn't buy that suit. Does it look that bad? Hm. You took quite the risk. Want a beer? Sure. Hey, how did you meet Lola? Well... at a party as boring as this one. The music's all the same. - I'm gonna take this. - Oh, yeah. ♪ Mañana luchan El amor de mi gente es tan sincero ♪ ♪ Tienen en el alma un sonajero ♪ ♪ I got it all ♪ ♪ Tengo todo lo que necesitas dentro ♪ ♪ Te arranco la pena ♪ ♪ Ah-ah-oh ♪ ♪ You need my fiebre inside you ♪ ♪ Sé que quieren gozar ♪ ♪ What you wanna know about me? ♪ ♪ What you wanna know about me? ♪ ♪ What you wanna know? ♪ What you wanna know about me? ♪ Val.
