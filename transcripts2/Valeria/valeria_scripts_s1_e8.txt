 - I told you. - Phew! Finding work in Valencia is more difficult than finding it here. Oh! I'm starting Monday. I'm starting Monday! Hey. - Listen. - What? Let's celebrate your first job in Madrid. Can we wait until I get my first pay check in Madrid, please? No. Lola, no. I know you. No. - Yes. - It looks private. - It is. So what? - No, come on. - Look, Val, now. You go first. - No. Yes, yes.

 What is this? I don't know. It's weird, right? Look, this is more interesting. But... So... welcome to Madrid! This is awesome! Hey... - To your first job. - I'm an intern. - To your first job! - All right! Dude, we really stick out here. Everyone's so dressed up. We look like interns. Which proves no one pays any attention to interns. I'll remember that. Except for him. He's cute, right? He's been checking you out since we got here. - You think so? - I don't think so, I know so. - Shit, he's coming over. - Let him. - What do I say? - Nothing. Let him do the talking. - Hi. - Hey. I saw you sneak in. But I'll pretend I didn't. - May I? - Yes. Sure. - Excuse me, what's your name? - Valeria. Valeria, can you move a bit closer to your friend? The light's better. Yes. - Sure. - Thanks. Look, I'm going to get another drink and let my friend dazzle you... with her own light. ♪ Let winter break ♪ What's your name?

LOTS OF MEETINGS AND COLD. WHEN WILL YOU LET ME SEE YOU AGAIN? IT'S BEEN A MONTH! BY THE WAY, CONGRATS ON YOUR NOVEL. I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, IMPOSTOR. 8. ELLIPSIS - Adri... - Val. I just got paid three grand for advertising those socks in my last video. - That's great. - Uh... How many days off from the museum do you have left? Um... Seven, I think. So come with me. Val, I think now is the perfect time for the Georgia road trip. If I keep earning this much, I can put on my own show. - Adri, now isn't... - I know you don't wanna spend a lot. No worries, I'll take care of everything. Spend a week with me, and I'll stay a couple more. I just turned in my novel. - Well, I'm sure it'll be a hit. - Hm. The thing is... Now I feel... empty. I don't think I can handle traveling. That's it? I'm not going to Georgia with a guy I met just two months ago. Why Georgia, anyway? I've been obsessed with that country for years. Val, it has amazing mountains and ruins. I'd love to rent a camper van and get lost with my camera. Lisbon. They say it's a beautiful city and has amazing bookstores. - Ah, well... I don't like cod that much. - Aww... But it wouldn't be a culinary trip, right? No... Mmm... Lisbon with a stranger. I don't know how I'll tell my parents. - They’ll understand, right? - I don't know. When you tell them you're going on your... well... you're going on your honeymoon. What? Yes, I think they will! Aah! When would you want to go? - Sweetie, do you have Montes's file? - Yes, Mom. Very good. What time's the trial? In a bit, mid-morning. - Shall we have lunch together? - Yes, I'll call you later. Are you joining us? Nerea? Nerea! I don't want to work with you anymore. What was that? You don't even know who I am. - Are... are you sick? Do you... - No, Mom, I'm not sick. I'm a lesbian. - Seriously? - Yes. Bravo! Yas, queen! So, how'd it go? They got in the car and drove off. That's it? Nothing else? Not even a "we'll talk about it later"? I told you they'd stop talking to me after I dropped the bomb. My parents think lesbians never wax or wear pink. What are you doing? Looking for a cigarette... Didn't Zaida leave any behind when she left? Look, being a lesbian is fine. Getting lung cancer... is not. I'm all worked up! Enough. You should be proud of yourself. It's done! You did what you had to do. Think about it. Don't you feel better? You did it! You did it, and now it's done. Yes. - Yes. - Amazing. Hey, do you mind if I stay with you? - Or do you have tourists here? - No! No, after the two Russians, I wanted some time alone. - Oh, right... - No, no! But you can stay. - For... as long as you like. - Yes? Thank you. Just until I find a job and can rent a room or a studio, hm? It will only be a month. Well, two at the most. We think this cream's perfect, but it's not for the perfect woman. Tall, short, thinner, fatter, different nationalities. Because there are no models. You're our model. So we've thought about the street marketing campaign. Imagine you're waiting for the bus and you see an ad at your stop, but this time, there's no poster. This time... there's... YOU'RE OUR MODEL ...a mirror. And you see your own reflection in the mirror. There are no models. You're our model. Lousy, huh? You should change brands. This one's awful. - Yes, it really does taste awful. - Mm. How long have you been working here, Carmen? Mmm... It will be five years in October. I was an intern here, and I ended up staying. Ever considered changing jobs? Like working on a more ambitious project, with more responsibility? Look, I really like how you think. I think you're... bold, intelligent. No one's ever sold me a campaign so quickly. - You make it look easy. - Thank you. I want you on my team. What? I'm creating a marketing department, so we can run our own campaigns. I want you to run it. - Me? - Yes, you. I can't think of anyone better. Senior salary. What do you say? Um... I'm so proud of you. And you for taking her in. Welcome, refugees. Babes, why are you in here? It's such a nice day. That's the thing. All the terraces are packed. - And it's happy hourhere. - Babe, you did great. Thanks. - To you, Nerea. - Yes, to you. Yes. To you. Hey, why are you late? No reason. Work stuff. Work stuff? Well, the thing is... one of my coworkers at the agency... is super annoying and was talking my ear off all day because... she was offered a really good job. Actually, it... it's better than good. It's amazing. She's not sure what to do. She's happy at the agency, and her coworker is also her boyfriend, like me and Borja. So if she takes the job, they'll never work together ever again. And the poor thing's a mess. Tell your friend not to mix up her career with her boyfriend. - Yes. - And tell her to take that job right now! - Right now. - Right now. I told her the same thing, of course. But she's just not convinced, I don't know. Right... Anyway, congratulate your friend on the job offer. - [Sure. - {Nerea] Yes. - Tell her... - The best... Let's forget about my friend, Okay? And you? How are you doing? Your voice message left us all in suspense. I can't take it anymore, girls. I'm leaving Adri. - You're getting married? - Yes! Hold on a second. - Are you sure? - Yes! Yes, really sure. To be a dreamer, you need someone by your side that dreams as much as you. And the most important thing is... he makes me really happy. - Really? - Very much. - Are you crying? - What? - You are! - No, I'm not. We've had four beers, and I'm a bit... Right. Lola's cry... All right, four beers and one shot! - Congrats on the wedding. - Thanks! Hey... why don't you drink one too? - Okay, then. - Hell, yeah! To your wedding! And to us. And to the bachelorette party! Hey, so when's the wedding? Lots of people prefer the spring. But I'd do fall. - People won't be dying of allergies. - Really? - Yes. - Are you a wedding planner? No, no. I'm in advertising, finishing my degree. Okay, so you can help me with something. Tell me how to get the attention of your silver fox of a boss. If you help me, she'll invite you to her wedding. - Him? - Seriously? - What? I think he's sexy. - Well... tomorrow's his birthday. - Nice! - Stop by! Ooh! - I think we're going to be great friends. - Yes! Did you tell him? I was going to tell him this morning, but he was so excited about planning his trip... with me... to Georgia. I could really use a trip right now. - But I wouldn't go. - No, me neither. Or, you could go... and tell him there. If I couldn't tell him at home, - I doubt I'll be able to in the Caucasus. - Right. The worst thing is that today should be the happiest day of my life, and I don't even feel like celebrating. Not even a little bit? A little bit? - Maybe a little bit. - There you go. When will you know the publication date? In a week, I guess. That's what's keeping me going. - Fuck, I've really messed up. - Enough. Stop thinking about what you've done and focus on what you have to do. - Mm-hm. - Don't worry, Adri's a sensible guy. Will he be really hurt? Yes. Will he listen to you? Yes. He'll just have to accept it, like we all do. This is so stressful. Oh. It's my sister! Okay, 12 minutes. - To the hospital! - What? - Now! - Okay. - The stroller. - Okay. - The layette. - The what? - The bag! - Okay! The bag! Ay! Shouldn't they be every five minutes? They won't send me home. I've got connections. Okay. Where is he? Call Jaime! All right. Jaime. There's no answer. Tell me something. Maybe I'll relax. I'm leaving Adrián. Are you crazy? You're really getting married? - We haven't even met him. - Good. He wouldn't want to marry me if he met you all. You're unbelievable. You're doing it to be first for once, right? - You really think that's why? - Of course. You always hated that I was first at everything. Honestly, I hated it more when you took my shampoo without asking. Just so you know, I'm not telling Mom and Dad. I'm thinking of just sending them the invitation. What's up? Has the baby been born yet? Please! They sent her home. She's so impatient. Your niece is putting off meeting her mother. You're telling me! Look at this hotel. It's really central and has a car rental service. - Well? - Looks cool. Would you prefer an apartment? No, a hotel's fine. So, should I book it? - Happy second anniversary. - Thanks. Oh! Cupcakes! - Mm. - Mmm! - Do you like them? - I love them. They're awesome. Here, try this one. Mm. ♪ They say it's a matter of time ♪ - I have a surprise for you. - What? - A letter from the publishers. - Oh! Oh, man! ♪ And I'm happy Nothing's going to stop me ♪ ♪ I'm making my way home ♪ ♪ I'm making my way ♪ Well? No, they say it's very well written, but they aren't interested. Like always. Babe, why not take a break? I don't know, it's been two years of bad news. I won't stop writing. Nothing's that fulfilling. You're not giving yourself the chance to like other stuff. Look, I'm just saying... don't let yourself be miserable over something that may never be. I know it's a shitty philosophy, but it's what I think. I won't stop. Of course not. ♪ I go solo ♪ ♪ Oh, I go solo ♪ ♪ I'm making my way ♪ Val. Val? Should I book it or not? Can we wait until tomorrow? I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted. Of course. PAIN - LOVE MOM Hi. I just saw Sergio. He was with a girl. His wife? If that was Marta, I want to know where she buys her anti-aging cream. Please! That girl was 22 at the most. - What are you looking for? - The smoke you wanted yesterday. We had such a connection... - I see you're still hooked. - No way, I'm just a social smoker. - I mean on Sergio. - Don't exaggerate. We connected... well. Really well. That's not easy to find. But it's over, end of story. Case closed... How are you doing? I sent out a couple of CVs and have been debating for three hours whether or not to call my parents. There are no cigarettes in this house. Go on a trip. Your place is not in Madrid right now. I owe my parents three grand, and I'm squatting at your place. The furthest I could go is Talavera de la Reina. For two days. Thank you so much for everything. You know what I'll miss the most? Making fun of your wardrobe. You're such an idiot. - You want a coffee? - No, thanks. I saw you, and you saw me. Damn, we were awesome at destroying the planet together. I still think about it, destroying the planet with you. So I want to see you. To the best creative team since Peggy Olson and Don Draper. You're so ridiculous! - "Ridiculous"? - Mm-hm. Did you see Jorge Rubio's face? He loves us. Yeah, well, that was today. Let's see what happens tomorrow. You know how it goes. They could... They could go with another agency or... or they could split us up. Clearly, we were in two different meetings. Hey... have you ever thought about... I don't know, leaving the company? Mmm... Before, yeah. I felt like I was in a bit of a rut at first. But since we've been a team, it's been great. Don't laugh, I'm serious. I love working with you. I have a lot of fun... Don't you? Yes. Yes. I love working with you too. And I also think we're the best team ever. They are all going to die. And I really like them. The penguins, I mean. We're on the path to extinction. Tell me about it. You're texting Val, aren't you? She posted a photo in the museum, and since it's Saturday, I'm cheering her up. You really like her. But you don't know what to do next... right? I do know. I swear, for the first time in my life, I know what to do. - Really? - Mm-hm. Well, please enlighten me. I want to take her out to dinner... and have breakfast, eat lunch and spend the whole day together and then get in bed, fuck... and sleep together. - And then... - You want a girlfriend. - No, I never said that. - Look. We feel so trendy because we want a partner without the "partner" label. But we basically want the same as the rest of humanity. Really? And what's that? Enlighten me, please. Well... someone who'll love us forever. ♪ Oh, brave... ♪ Like penguins. They only have one partner, and it works fucking great. ♪ Oh, brave ♪ ♪ Your heart is made To live in freedom... ♪ - I can't make it to lunch. - ♪ Fighting the liars ♪ - Because I want to study all day. - ♪ Some win and some lose ♪ - Yeah, Procedural Law tomorrow and then... - ♪ Loneliness drowns us ♪ ♪ When the fear rules ♪ ♪ Yes I know ♪ ♪ I know ♪ ♪ If you got the bad blood ♪ ♪ Try and tame your... ♪ Damn it. Am I bothering you? Well, yes. I'm sorry! My bad. What are you writing? My second novel. Not that the first one was published, but I gave up on it. Good luck, then. It will be great, you'll see. Thanks. May I? Sure... Hang on. Here. She said if I get stuck, I should write it as a short story. I think it's good advice. Look, Val. Our spot. You never give me advice. About my literary career, I mean. - Yes, I've given you some. - You told me to give up. Great advice! You never read anything I write. In fact, you don't know me as a writer. Are you different from my wife? Well, yes, very. Your wife Valeria is daring, a real go-getter. But Valeria the writer is even more so. The trouble is when neither Valeria gets what she wants, Adri, the photographer and husband, pays for it. That's not true. Val, for every rejection, you spend a month sulking. - You never cheer me up. - Val, I don't want to argue. I'm tired. I'm going home. - Well, I'm going for a beer. - Fine! ♪ Thought I found a way ♪ ♪ Thought I found a way, yeah ♪ ♪ Found ♪ ♪ But you never go away ♪ ♪ Never go away ♪ ♪ So I guess I gotta stay now ♪ ♪ Oh, I hope some day ♪ ♪ I'll make it out of here ♪ ♪ Even if it takes all night ♪ ♪ Or a hundred years ♪ ♪ Need a place to hide ♪ ♪ But I can't find one near ♪ - Hi, girls. - ♪Wanna feel alive... ♪ I couldn't talk to Adri yesterday.

What should I do with this ugly box? - Should I throw it out? - Leave it there. No, give it here. I can use it to store stuff. Matryoshka method. Too many books, right? You need a plant. Plants liven up a room. - No, no plants. - Why not? The idea is to fill the empty spaces. - More books then. - Exactly. Take mine. They're in storage because they don't fit in my place. Girls, do you mind stopping for now? You feel awful, right? It's all right.

I know! I can't believe it either. Uh... And... and what did you say? Nothing yet, but I'm gonna accept. Huh? Seriously? Hey, I love working with you. - You know that. - Mm. Yes. - But this is a hell of an opportunity. - Uh-huh... Twice the salary... And they'll even put a coffee machine in my office. Wow! I really wanted to say hi the other day. So why didn't you? I guess it wasn't the right time. I miss you. When do you miss me the most? When you're fucking your wife, or when you're eating your lover's pussy? I wanted to see you too. But you're not the person I want to be with. Do you get the difference? Do you? Remember that last time, you were the one... that wanted to play the happy couple. Look... I don't want us to miss each other or say things we might regret. If we really want to see each other, it should be to do what we're best at. ♪ Voilà ♪ ♪ Voilà ♪ ♪ Voilà ♪ ♪ Voilà ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Instant fantasy ♪ ♪ I've got something up my sleeve ♪ ♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa ♪ - ♪ Anything, you want it, I got it ♪ - ♪ Hey ♪ - ♪ Watch me pull it out of my pocket ♪ - ♪ Huh ♪ - ♪ Turn up on the beat and I'll drop it ♪ - ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Thee, two, one ♪ ♪ Voilà ♪ ♪ Any, anything that you want ♪ ♪ Voilà ♪ - ♪ Any, anything that you want... ♪ - Where did you learn to do that?

Because, um... you're coming with me to Cambodia. I'd love to, but no. I'm broke. Uh... Here. - What's this? - Open it. I wrote to Lola because... I wanted to organize a surprise dinner for you before I left. And she came up with this great idea. I wish I had friends like yours. EQUIS CINEMA BRIEF ENCOUNTER He was gone, and suddenly I felt the horror of never being able to see him again. Darling, I'm sorry. I couldn't warn you... Run! Your train! The headmistress needed an urgent operation. You're going to miss it! I wanted to send you a note, but I thought if they called your name, you'd get angry. Please stop apologizing. Run! Run! This is the scene where she tells him to run to catch his train. It's one of my favorite movies. I've seen it a thousand times. Now you're a romantic? Actually, I'm turning into a penguin. What? Nothing. Forget it. How are you? Tomorrow, I'm meeting my editor to find out when my novel comes out. It's like having your arm amputated all of a sudden. You have to learn to do everything with the other one. But it'll get better. It was the right decision. I wish I could catch a train right now and just disappear. Run, run! It's about to leave! So let's go. Why so spontaneous? Let's go to Atocha station and get on the first train. Then we'll decide what to do. What are you saying? I know you need time to realize you're free. But I want to remind you. You're free. Víctor... What we have is really special, but... right now, I can't think about... Right now, I need some time. They had to meet lots of Thursdays to realize they loved each other. That's just a movie. We're much more than that. ♪ Everybody hurts ♪ ♪ Everybody hurts sometimes ♪ ♪ Sometimes everybody hurts ♪ ♪ Everybody hurts ♪ - ♪ Everybody hurts ♪ - ♪ Everybody hurts ♪ - ♪ Everybody hurts ♪ - ♪ Sometimes ♪ ♪ Sometimes... ♪ Valeria! - Do me a favor. - What?

Again. - No, no, no, no, no. - It's perfect. - Oh! But... we have a new sales strategy. Do you know Pierre Duvont? Sure. He wrote that best-selling erotic saga. - It's a pseudonym. - Huh? Pierre Duvont isn't real. There's a girl like you behind that name. At the time, we thought it was an original way to sell the books. Finally, a straight writer who understands women as if he were one. And it worked. This... is a Pierre Duvont. No. No, this is a Valeria Férriz. I gave it my all, and it cost me my marriage. I said you wouldn't like it, but please listen to me. If we publish your novel in Pierre Duvont's name, you'll make a lot of money. A lot. Valeria, please look at me. You'll finally make a living doing what you love most. And then, I promise I'll publish whatever you want under your name.
