 Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008–2009): Season 1, Episode 9 - What He Beheld - full transcript 
 Sarah finds herself in a business transaction with a mysterious business man named Sarkissian, who claims to be in possession of the stolen Turk computer system and wants an exorbitant amount of money for it. Cromartie closes in on John at his school, and Cameron thinks of a way to throw him off John's trail. Derek recalls his childhood before the so-called Judgement Day in 2011, when a nuclear war triggered by Skynet will destroy the world. Agent Ellison finally discovers that the terminator Cromartie is impersonating an FBI agent, and makes arrangements to apprehend him.

 Twenty-thousand. That's a discount in these hard times. Especially for someone who's been dead eight years. Your fiancée killed a man because she believed in the future... ...he'll invent a computer system that declares war on the world. Skynet... ...robots from the future. -And you're a-- -Yes, l'm a-- These things, aIl of them, are programmed with specific missions. Don't let that touch me. -We have to stop you bleeding. -Get it away. -You don't even know who this guy is. -He's your uncIe. He doesn't know. My Turk could defeat every human player that has ever lived... ...and probably ever will live. You talk about it like it's human. -Well, you never know.

 -Who bought The Turk? -I was paid money for it. That's-- That's all l have. Sarkissian returned my caIl. He'll meet about selling The Turk. When John was little, he used to sleep... -...with his hand under my chin. -Come on. At night I'd lay awake watching him. Calm, peaceful, happy. I wanted to freeze time... ...and let my son live in that moment forever. But you can't freeze time. You can't protect your children from the future that awaits them. -Batting's hard, Derek. -You're doing great, Kyle... ...just remember how l showed you. Stay on top of the balI. The moment's there... ...and then... -Yes! -Yes. Finally. ...it's gone. Fireworks. Cool. He's a very hotheaded man. -I Iearned Armenian. -Armenian. The guy we're meeting with, his name's Sarkissian. -That's Armenian. -Well, we're not here to charm him... ...we're here to get The Turk and get out. Simple. He said we should meet him at Table 19. Excuse me, I think we have business to take care of. Oh. Of course. Sorry. Table 19? -It's right there. -Keep the change. Remind me again, why are the boys out here... ...and the girls in there? Because one of the boys is still wanted for murder... ...and one of the girls is harder than nuclear nails. And the other one's a cyborg. -You wanna know why we're really here? -Why? -Moore's Law. -Hmm? Moore's Law. The guy who founded lntel said... ...that every two years the number of transistors on a computer chip doubIes. Thirty years ago it was an observation, now it's a law. Tech industry spend bilIions doubling chip power. And? And that's how we can go from a chess computer... ...to the apocalypse in just four years. I learned that a lot can happen... ...in four years. A lot can happen in four seconds. One minute l'm in the yard with my brother playing basebaIl... ...the next, we Iook up and the sky's on fire. Judgment Day. What did you do? Only thing to do. Took Kyle, went underground. What was he like? He was just a kid when it happened. Eight years oId. I was 15. How do you tell an 8-year-old machines have taken over the world? How do you? You don't. Maybe he's at another table. -Nice doing business with you. -We don't have 500,000 dollars. Not yet. Mr. Dixon. What's it been, eight years? Mm. I see you're a man of faith. Oh. No, my wife's a Catholic. It's her mother's. Do you know the story on the rapture, Mr. Dixon? Like I said. My wife. Hmm. And l heard as it were, the noise of thunder. And l heard the voice of the fourth beast say: "Come and see." And l looked. And behold, a pale horse. And his name that sat on him was Death. And helI followed with him. The Book of Revelation. What is this? I've seen some things, Mr. Dixon. I've seen some things with my own eyes and heard them with my own ears. I've beheld. And upon my beholding, I've come to the conclusion... ...while new to me... ...might be old hat for you. What the heIl are you taIking about? Sarah Connor is alive. And l think you know where she is. You're crazy. If Sarah is aIive, and l believe she is... ...we are working in a reaIm where much, perhaps anything, is possibIe. Robots... ...soldiers from the future... ...Skynet. If... ...Sarah were alive... ...l'm sure she'd like to hear you say that. Come on, tell me what you know. I'm gonna tell you... ...what I told the other guy. I don't know anything. -The other guy? -Yeah. The other agent that you guys sent here. Kester. Kester. Watch-- You see him? Where'd you get this at, homey? I don't know, homey. Can l help you with something, bro? -That is a nice sword. -Hey. -You don't touch that. -Family heirloom? -None of your business. -You're right. -But this is my business. -Shh, shh, shh. Do you know this woman? Never seen her before in my life. Well, I'll help you out. Her name's Sarah Connor. -I know that because I read her FBI file. -I told you... ...l don't know her. Well, that's very interesting. Because your uncle Enrique knew her. He knew her pretty welI, in fact. And you know what? He's in that file too. As one of her last known associates... ...and an FBl informant. You know what l think? I think she went to him Iooking for identification. And l think he sent her to you. And l think after she got what she wanted... ...she went back to Enrique. And l think she killed him. And now I have something she wants. So where is she? "Los Niños Héroes." They were the six military cadets that died defending Chapultepec CastIe. Brave boys. Now, my friend... ...how brave a boy are you? I'll handle this. -What are you doing here? Go home. -I need to talk to you. Agent EIlison came into my house. -And you turn around and come to mine? -I know. lt's okay. This is gonna be hard for you to imagine, but I think he's ready to believe you. Believe me? Charlie, this isn't about believing me. -If he believes you, he can protect you. -Do you remember what you saw here? What we destroyed? Who destroyed it? The FBI can't protect us, you can't protect us. If one of them folIows you here-- Not the FBI. --one of them... ...you'll have killed us. So take your wife, get as far away from here as you can. Forget me, forget John, just go. Faint-yelIow tint. Grade M. Slightly included, shallow cut. You can't just give a briefcase full of money and expect he's gonna hand over The Turk. ActualIy, l can. Well, those are from the safe house I set up so technically, they're mine. Well, I'm guessing you stole them. So technically, they're evidence in a felony. What are we up to? Current estimated value: 246,000. You don't even have enough. We'll negotiate. We don't even know what this guy looks like. We know what The Turk looks like. I love these pIaces. Food courts? Day after me and the guys jumped, we went to the Century City Mall... ...we spent the whole day there. We all puked. And the funny thing, in the future? The place is a concentration camp. Is that it? Where is he? The son of a bitch stood us up again? We have to go. -We came here for The Turk. -Can't get it if we're in prison. Sarah Connor. So nice to finalIy meet you. You know, a woman... ...she calls my ceIl phone... ...she says she's interested in buying this very special computer. Now, what do you do? Just turn around or you just seIl it? Or maybe.... You're very beautiful... ...for a dead woman. Just let us pay you for the computer and you'll never hear from us again. If l was gonna sell you The Turk... ...you'd have had it by now. So this is my counteroffer. The money you was gonna pay me for The Turk... ...you take that number and you multiply it by four. Two million dollars? You're a fugitive, Ms. Connor. Might make that a smalI price for freedom. Here's my counteroffer. You tell us where The Turk is, we keep our money... ...and l bury you in the backyard. Ha, ha. Will you listen to me? If l don't walk out of here in 10 minutes... ...my people are instructed to call the FBI... ...and tell them everything I know. -Your people? -Yeah. My people. Same people who are watching your son. He's on a field trip, isn't he? With his class? Science museum, I beIieve. Your people have no idea what they're walking into. Derek. How long do we have to get the money? You got 24 hours. FolIow him. You haven't spoken for 28 minutes. Oh, it's nothing. All right. My birthday's tomorrow. Okay? I know that Mom totally forgot. -Birthday? -Yeah. You don't know what a birthday is? It's the day you were born. Pretty memorable for a mother, right? But it was 16 years ago. No, a birthday's like a holiday. Like, once a year, every year... ...people just kind of celebrate you, I guess. And you get presents and you eat cake and... ...it's fun. Ha. It's supposed to be. Last year, Mom got me a flak jacket. That's a tight present. No. It's not. Whatever, look, I-- I don't know why I care. I've been driving since l was 12 and technically, this is my 24th birthday. It's just l time-traveled over eight of them. Do I have a birthday? I don't know. Were you born? I was built. Well, then maybe you have, Iike, a builtday. Hey, Cameron. Listen to this. Hey, what do you have in there, man? Hatful of Hollow, man. Just downloaded it this morning. Dude, you gotta be kidding me, I love The Smiths. Yeah, here. I don't have that album. Cameron. Stay with the group, please. Sorry. Hey, Cameron. There you are. Your brother's been looking for you. Oh, wow. Is this your car? No. It belongs to the guy I killed and stuffed in the trunk. Hey. Where you been? Mom says we gotta get home right now. -What's up with the car? -Cameron stuffed a dead guy in the trunk. He was following us. Your sister's dark, bro. -You're gonna love The Smiths. -Yeah, she's, uh-- -She's really goth. -Get in. Wait, Cameron. Hey, um-- There's something I kind of need to ask you. Um, you think maybe you might wanna go to the prom with me? -Just say yes. -Yes. Yes. Yes. Ha-ha-ha! Hey, Karen. Can you run a name for me? I thought you knew everybody around here. -Who you looking for? -Guy's name is Kester. He's an agent. Oh, doesn't ring a bell, give me a sec. Here we go. This the guy? We've been swamped lately, it's all l can do to keep this place organized. What file did you need? File number 100-655371 . The Sarah Connor case. Looks like it's checked out, my friend. To Agent Ellison. -James Ellison? -One and only. Thank you for your time. Oh, hold the elevator. He was a threat to us. Did he say anything? A name? A location? He said very little. And then he was quiet. I lost Sarkissian at the Cahuenga Pass. Damn it. -We have to find him. -We have to get out of this house. -No. We're not moving. -He knows where we live. We're not running. Not today. This house has a bull's-eye painted on the front door. Do your thing. HeIlo. Still watching those kids? I got my eye on them right now. Well, I think they had someone follow me. No more games, bring them back here. "Here"? Where's "here"? Okay, so he's expecting this guy to show up there any minute. And when he doesn't, the first place he's gonna come is here. Mom. We can't stay here, John. Not while he's out there. It's too risky. I'm sorry. Wait here. -Where is he? -Who? -Unh! -He. Need l repeat? John, go check the office, see if he stashed The Turk in there. Can you get through the door? Yes. But the wall would be much faster. Hi. What are you doing here? Waiting for my daddy to finish work. Okay, listen. I need you to stay in this room with the door closed, okay? Even if you hear Ioud noises or you get scared... ...you need to stay in here. Can you do that for me? -Yeah. -Yeah? Okay. Let him go. Not my kid. Not mine, either. Shh, shh, shh. You okay? Yeah. You okay? John. Let's go inside. Let's go in. Hey. Is that your daddy out there in the alley? No. My daddy works in the café. Do you know how to get back there from here? You go find your daddy. Don't look back, just go. Unh. Sarkissian's hard drive. Come on. Do I need to kill you now? Kester. That's what he likes to calI himself when he's out trick-or-treating in his FBl costume. George LaszIo's a better actor than we thought. That's not Laszlo. James, are we looking at the same picture here? This is your guy. It's Laszlo. The blood doesn't match. Come on. What are you saying? This guy somehow killed six people... ...and then found a plastic surgeon who made him look identical to George Laszlo? And then what? Killed Laszlo, stoIe his identity... ...and then put himself in the FBl database as this guy, Kester? To what end? What's the goal here? Who is he? What is he? "What" is he? Yeah. What is he? What is he that stands across from a man... ...after kilIing two other men within 36 hours? And when asked of his involvement... ...cannot only lie, but lie well. And not only lie well... ...but not blink or twitch... ...or perform one simple human reaction to the situation. So yes. I think it's fair to ask, what is he? You know as well as l. Some men are monsters. Yeah. Monsters. Let's go get him. Yeah. -Mom. -Sorry. Look, he double-encrypted the drive. I've unlocked a lot of it but there's still a lot left to go through. How much? About a thousand useful files, each takes about five minutes to decrypt... ...and l'm on number 37. You do the math. Let me know when you have something. How you hoIding up? I'm all right. So it's your birthday. How-- How'd you know? You kidding? I celebrated your 30th with you. How was that? You got drunk as a skunk. Come on, I'll buy you a beer. I'm 16. All right, l'll buy you an ice-cream cone. Come on, it's your birthday. When there are things to celebrate, they should be celebrated. Let's go. Your mom has never kilIed anyone, has she? You know, she's got murder in her eyes all the time, but her heart's pure. It's a good thing, you know. Keep a-- Keep a pure heart. It's beautiful here, isn't it? When you stay long enough you start fooling yourself into thinking that this is... ...how it's always gonna be. Then you remember what this place wiIl look like when it's on fire and... ...you realize you'll do whatever it takes to keep from watching it burn again. Is that you? -And the younger one. ls that--? -Kyle. Throws pretty good for a 5-year old, huh? Your father always had a nice arm. -How'd you know? -Every time l look at you, I see him. Besides, your mom's his type. Happy birthday. All fire and EMT personnel advised to standby. FBI raid in North Hollywood. Suspect considered armed and extremely dangerous. May be posing as an FBI agent. Last name, Kester. Move, move, move! Go, go, go! FalI back! FalI back, now! Shoot! Shoot him! In Lord of the Flies, a group of boys... ...slaughter a pig in the jungle. They torture it and place its head on a sharpened stake... ...as an offering to the beast that hovers God-like over the island. The black blood drips down the pig's teeth... ...and the boys run away. Later, when one of the boys is alone, he weeps. But not for the pig. The boy weeps for the end of innocence and the darkness of men's hearts. Have you seen Derek? No. He's, uh, still at the park, I think. What were you two doing? Nothing. Uh, just went to get an ice cream. Here. Check these out. Looks like you weren't the only one Iooking for The Turk. -Who's this? -I'm not sure. But he came in after Dmitri and before you. Enough time for Sarkissian to sell him The Turk. It's not much to go on, but it's something. -Why don't you take a break? -No, it's all right. l can keep going. How are we supposed to celebrate your birthday if you're in front of a computer? You actually thought I forgot your birthday? We have much more important things to think about than my stupid birthday. Your birthday's important. No, it's-- lt's not important. Finding The Turk, stopping Skynet, Judgment Day, that's important. That's-- That's our life. It's our mission. This is our Iife. If we stop caring about that, then we're lost. When you put it like that.... I sent Cameron to get a cake. What do you want for dinner? Well, not to insult your cooking or anything, but do you mind if we went out? We can do that. All right, let me-- Let me shut this down. What? What's the matter? The guy that Derek killed in the alley. Sarkissian. I don't think that was Sarkissian.
