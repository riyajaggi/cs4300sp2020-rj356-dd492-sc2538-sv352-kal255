 -Where are we? -Same where. Different when. I want my new name. My whole new me. I'll track down Enrique. I need three sets of papers. My nephew has taken over the business. -You're in the system and everything. -Uncle Enrique would be proud. He referred to you as a rata. Snitch. -Why would you do this? -Because you wouldn't. -Why not stay in the past? -You died two years ago. Cancer. -I've seen that before. -Skynet work camp. Resistance fighters. -You sure there's money here? -Anything they valued. Money. Guns. It would be hidden. You told me we'd be safe.

 Skynet doesn't know you're here. There's no directive to hunt you. What if they found out? Would they all know what to do? Who the hell are you, man? Ah-- They do. When I was in the mental hospital I became obsessed with science. Not all science, actually. And not really science at all. Scientists, and then only nuclear scientists. The ones who invented the bomb. Oppenheimer, Heisenberg, Fermi and Teller. Pioneers. Geniuses all. I read every book I could. I wanted to understand. Why couldn't they stop? These fathers of our destruction? And why wouldn't anybody stop them? And if I had the chance, would I? Good morning. -You look like hell. -Up late. Newspaper clippings, surveillance photos, bank records. Pamphlets from every high-tech company in the state. Even thought I saw the deeds to city hall in here somewhere. Those Resistance guys weren't sent back here to be our support crew. They're a Skynet hunting party. Really? Are you sure? Most of this is still a puzzle to me, but there is one list in here I understand. Employee list, Cyberdyne Systems. Seems they thought it was a good place to start. And it is. She's not gonna be happy to see you. She never is. -You want me to come along? -No. You have your own job to do. A big one. You're getting pretty good at that. Thank you. Still, it's not brain surgery or anything. It would be funny if you were some advanced cybernetic intelligence... ...yet stumped by a stick of eyeliner. No, it's not brain surgery. Would have to be a lot sharper for brain surgery. Much better. When you wear clothes, much better. Okay, six ways in, six ways out. The front opens to the street here. Security's minimal. Two armed guards in the morning. Four in the afternoon. If anything goes wrong, there's a parking lot here. Mom, it's high school, okay? Not supermax. We can handle it. We can handle it. Don't you kiss me. Or anyone else. -Okay, now blend in. -Blend in. Yeah, I mean don't seem like a freak. You know what I mean, right? Freak. Weirdo. Kook. Oddball. Crackpot. Strange duck. Queer potato. Nut. I've been reading the dictionary. -I don't sleep. -That's what I'm talking about. You do that, you sound like a freak. Don't walk around like my bodyguard. You're supposed to be my sister. You won't fool anyone. I fooled you. What's that all about? Appears to be a re-imagining of a trompe l'oeil fresco. I don't sleep. Cell phones, hats, rings, and bling. Take it off and put it in the basket. Cell phones, hats, rings, and bling in the basket. In the basket, people. Come on. The line keeps moving. Let's go. Cell phones, hats, rings, and bling in the basket. Keep the line moving. Cell phones, caps, rings, and bling in the basket please. Let's go. Come on. Thank you. Cell phones, caps, rings, and bli-- Again with you, missy. Cell phones, hats, rings and bling in the basket. -Hold that. Come through. -Come on. Come on, we ain't got all day. Excuse me. This is my sister. Extra credit for you. Look, she's got a metal plate in her head. Really. lt's a big one. Look at this. All right, metal head, let's go through. I fell. Hard. All right, let's go. Go ahead. Cell phones, caps. I thought you were dead. -Well, I'm not. Lucky you. -You look-- -Different? The same. -Well, I can't explain. -I wouldn't want you to. -Is John--? -He's good. What about that machine? She's still around. Not that one. -The other. -No. Do you mind? You brought it. Danny's not here? It's ten years, right? He's at school. -He hasn't come in a long time. -I'm sorry to hear that. What do you want, Sarah? You never die and you always want something. I need you to look at these photographs. Tell me if you recognize anybody. I know it's been a long time but.... No. Nobody. Sorry. Because one of them may be involved with Skynet right now. They might not even know it. Sorry to bother you. I'll leave you alone. The fourth photo. The young one. His name is Andrew Goode. Andy. He was an intern at Cyberdyne one summer. Miles liked him. Is he going to die too? Is that what happens now? He dies? I don't know. I hope not. Well, if he does, just make sure it matters. Make sure it's not in vain. No one dies in vain. Agent Ellison. They told me you were coming. But I told them the last time you worked a scene... ...Hoover was cross-dressing at Quantico. Ballistics. I can already tell you mine are bigger. Same gun that killed your boys here killed one of my Cls. Enrique Salzia. What's the connection? He made fake paper. Your guys had fake paper. Hope you're not selling the terrorist-cell theory because I'm not buying it. -Why not? -Look at the print report. Cal. lD, NClC, CDP, Interpol. There's nothing here. These guys were drug dealers. Small-time. Definitely not worth you putting your tie on... ...and breaking open your Thomas Guide. Oh, yeah. We see this every day. You didn't find that curious? Why would anyone wire a safe directly into the power? Why's the sky blue, Ellison? Don't overthink it. The guys were druggies. They're not rocket scientists, not terrorists. Your guy sold my guys paper. My guys whacked your guy to cover their tracks. Go back to your office. Your desk misses you. Right. Good one. Somebody came back here for whatever was in that safe. They're out there. And I'm gonna find them. Hey, buddy, wait. You can't go in there. Hey. Hey. All right. Uh, the receipt's in the bag. Let me know if you have any problems. You shouldn't have any problems setting up the-- The-- You know. -You should be pretty happy. -Cool, that's so.... Let me know if you have any problems with it. -Enjoy. -Thank you. Have a good day. Can I help you? No. Andy. Just looking. You just kept looking over like you needed something. That's the phone. Seriously, if I was gonna be alone on a desert island... ...with only a phone for a companion that would be the phone. Is that something you would do? May I? Got a four-meg camera... ...texting-- True texting too. Not that SMS cartoon-bubble junk. 3G data access, 10 gigs free music... ...six hours of talk time and 36 standby on your battery. What happens if I press these numbers here? -Excuse me? -These numbers? One through nine? If I press seven of them will someone talk to me... ...through the ear part up here? Uh.... Yeah. Okay. I'll take three. -Hello? -Hi. Are you calling me? Uh, I was just following up to make sure everything's okay. -I just left the store. -I know. Okay. Do you wanna have dinner with me tonight? No. Well, you answered too quickly. Hear me out. Just give me one minute. -Thirty seconds? -Talk fast. Okay, first let me clear up the whole desert-island-and-a-cell-phone thing. -It seems strange if you picture it. -I wasn't. Right. Why would you? It's an asinine sales pitch. Nowhere to plug in the phone. It would be worth less than a rock... ...when the battery died. Couldn't even use it to open a coconut. -This is you selling yourself? -Selling myself? I don't know. There's something immoral about the whole selling process. -And yet, that's your job. -Part-time. And I'm not very good at it. So I'm actually less immoral than the average-- Anyway. Um.... Where was I? -You're right. -About what? I answered too quick. -Mr. Baum? -Yes? Take your seat, please. -Hi. -Hi. Okay. Paper and pencil out. Time for a pop quiz. Here. Come in. I said come on in. I'm transferring in. -That's what I'm talking about. -What's up with that? Okay. Any open seat. What part about "Don't act like a freak" didn't you understand? Sit down. -So. -So. Like I said on the phone, your sweet Uncle Enrique lived a colorful life. One we have not yet painted in full. You grow apart. Every day's a new adventure. Who can keep up? I got an uncle who's like a father. I also got one who's like a stranger. How about you two? More like an aunt. Chatty, chatty. All right. So you're not too close. But he did call you three times the day he was murdered. -What did you chat about? -Those Lakers. -Really? What about them? -Kobe. He's the bomb. I always thought he was a ball hog. He's all alone, man. He's got no one else who can shoot. Is that you, Carlos? Now that your uncle's dead? You all alone? Yeah. All these boys can shoot. -I didn't kill my uncle. -No. And you're too smart to know nothing about who did. I'll be in touch. No, I know. The guy's 18 months ahead of the Germans. Yeah, well, I would if I had that kind of grant money. No, I'm not saying the guy's a complete idiot. It's not exactly avant-garde science, is it? Why don't they give money to people on the cutting edge? But they never do. They never-- Hey. -How was school? -I have a metal plate in my head. She's gonna need a note. -I meant you, not her. -Yeah, fine. You're not gonna give me anything? We went, we learned. I didn't get killed and she didn't kill anybody. It was a pretty good first day. -What about you, did you go? -I did. How was she? Surprised you weren't dead? More like disappointed. She lD'd one of the safe-house photos. -Intern at Cyberdyne. -Really? What does he do? Work in a lab or build rocket guidance systems or something? -Cell phone salesman. -Shut up. Cell phone salesman, and not a very good one. These need to be cleaned. Okay, so about the cell-phone guy. I'm having dinner with him tonight. -Dinner? You mean, like a date? -Not a date. Are you going to kill him? Kill him? I don't know the first thing about him. He interned at Cyberdyne in college. His photo's in a pile of photos. Nobody dies till I say so. Tell her. People die all the time. They won't wait for her. I fooled you again. Who are you? How did you find me? What-- What do you want? Are you a veteran? Is that what this is about? Do you speak? Read that. How--? How did you--? No, no, no. That's not possible. That's an epidermal growth rate that's not sustainable. Keratinocyte and-- At that rate you couldn't possibly maintain cell regulation or differentiation. It's impossible. Possible. Woo was wrong. Thomason was wrong. Parker and Lang were almost right, but still... ...completely wrong. I was-- I wasn't even close. Can you do it? Well, I'd have to go to my lab. There's a whole mix of growth rates. TGF-beta, PDGF, EGF-- I'd need-- You know, there's a lot of equipment. Oh, and blood. We need at least 20 units. -Preferably with tissues comprised-- -I brought my own. Can you do it? Yes. Yes, I can. In 1943... ...the German physicist Werner Heisenberg... ...delivered a physics lecture to a packed hall in Zurich. One of the audience members was Moe Berg... ...an ex-professional baseball player working as a spy for the OSS. Berg's task was to listen to the lecture and determine whether the Germans... ...were close to perfecting the atomic bomb. If Berg discovered that this was the case... ...he was to wait for Heisenberg outside the hall... ...and shoot the scientist in the head. He had never killed anyone before. So what's your deal, Andy? I can't imagine you majored in cell phone sales at college. No. No. More like Funyuns and 12 packs of Jolt from the vintage soda store... ...while my roommates and I hacked "Zelda III"... ...so the princess would say funny lines ripped from reruns. What's that language you speak, boy? Computer science. Caltech. Advanced Dork. And what would you do with a computer degree from Caltech? I don't know. I never got one. -Really? -My father died senior year. Mom went a little off the rails. I dropped out to help. I'm sorry. No, it was a long time ago, but thanks anyway. She's good. She married the security guard at her bank. Do you have family? Distant. Don't take this the wrong way, but as a cell phone salesman I think I can ask. Did you ever wanna be anything other than a waitress? -Yes, I did. -What was it? I can't remember. What's this, Andy? Oh, isn't it great? That is the official promotional poster for the Kramnik-Deep Fritz match. Awesome match. Just awesome. Most people cite the '97 Kasparov-Deep Blue... ...as the watershed man-versus-machine chess match. But, uh, Fritz would have wiped the floor with Blue... ... just like Kramnik did with Kasparov. Besides, the other poster's impossible to find. What is it you do, Andy? Do you wanna see? Yes, I wanna see. All right. Behold. The Turk. -The Turk? -Well, not the original Turk. The original Turk was an automaton... ...constructed and unveiled in 1770 by the Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen. It played chess. Is that what your Turk does? It plays chess? I know that sounds boring as hell. Most people think so. But maybe I should put it this way: My Turk plays chess at a level that could defeat every human player... ...that has ever lived and probably ever will live. That's not bragging. A number of Als can do that now. But the AI chess platform is very valuable... ...for artificial intelligence developers. What? I thought I saw someone outside. Uh, yeah, it's a prowler. Uh, back porch. lt's the police. There's been break-ins in the neighborhood. -My-- -I have to go, Andy. No, Sarah, wait. Uh, it's 165 Mesrow. Sarah! Again, what did it look like? What did it look like? Who cares what it looked like? It was a rack of computer equipment. Okay, but was there obvious network access? -Do you know what kind of bandwidth? -You're joking. What about power supply? Was there a cooling element? -Like a fan or something? -John-- I'm just trying to get a sense of the horsepower. I wanna know if this thing was a dinky little homemade soap box... ...or if it was a full-fledged AI platform... ...capable of learning and growing and taking on other applications. It plays chess. So did Einstein. Have you ever heard of the Singularity? It's a point in time where machines become so smart... ...that they're capable of making smarter versions of themselves without our help. That's pretty much the time we can kiss our asses goodbye. Unless we stop it. Like you said you would. So I caught a break on a set of fingerprints from our drug dealers. I wanted to see your face when I laid that on you. See, the only fingerprint database I hadn't checked was kid prints. Ha, ha. That's no joke. That's him. That's one of your dead terrorists. A black-haired, brown-eyed, 35-pound, 4-year-old boy living in Canton, Ohio. And that's the look I wanted to see. Hold up. Did your crime-scene guys find any peculiar blood? I think they got all the peculiar they could stomach with these prints. Lab says some blood evidence found at my CI crime scene is almost human. Except there's no red blood cells present. I wanna see the blood evidence from your guys. I'll get back to you. You're gonna double check those prints, right? On the kid in Canton? Have a party. The thing I hadn't thought of, the thing nobody thought possible... ...was the use of a synthetic oxygen carrier. By creating a synthetic spear that carries oxygen bringing nutrients to the skin... ...it obviates the need for the marrow interaction. The real-world applications are, well, mind-blowing. It's ready. I have a video camera. Would it be all right if--? Move away. Who are you? What are you? Sarah? Didn't you get my message? I returned your call about the results. -Yeah, I got your message. -Yeah. You're healthy as a horse. A healthy horse. I got that from your message. I wanted to talk to you about prevention. For cancer? What you're doing seems to be working. Specifically. Um.... Don't smoke. Get lots of exercise. Eat leafy greens. Don't snort asbestos. I don't mean to make light, but you've got no risk factors. No genetic disposition. Is there anything else about your history that I should know? No. You've got children, right? Yeah, I got two myself. You worry. You wanna make sure you're always healthy and strong for them. Don't drive yourself crazy chasing the future. We can't predict. You know? We can only try and prevent. Andy, it's Sarah. Forget about it. -Hey. -Hi. -You going to chem? -Yeah. -What is going on? -No idea. She is such a skanky whore. Ugh, disgusting. Dirty whore. I love this color. It's tight, right? This color's tight. -What is it? -Rash. It's so tight. I'm a pig. I look pregnant. Does this make me look fat? Yes. What the hell? What's your problem? You asked. Bitch-whore much? I don't understand. I said, bitch-whore much? What are you looking at? I'm looking at you. You saw it, right? Right? You saw it? It's so freaking big, and right out there. -It's freaking big. -Right. lt is, right? Whoever's doing this is such a jackass. I mean, who would do this? And how would they even know? My parents. They're gonna kill me. Kill me. I mean, don't we have hall monitors? I mean, how could someone just-- You're upset. No kidding, I'm upset. My life is freaking over. Here's a present. It's tight. I have to admit, I wondered if I'd see you again. -Miracles happen every day. -That's funny. -That was a joke, right? -If it was funny, it was a joke. So the police recommended that I put in a security system. Armed patrol, that kind of thing. Can't really afford it, though. -You think someone wants the Turk? -Well, eight years of my life. Not just the software. I customized the hardware too. One month, I worked so much on a motherboard... ...that I lost my sight for three days. No, that really happened. Those circuits are so small. A lot of the gear is actually pulled from gaming platforms. Did you know that the military uses them? Yeah, I've got the guts of three Xboxes and four PlayStations, daisy-chained. Plus some seriously modded-out code that I swear came to me in a dream. And all this to beat another computer at chess? None of this to beat another computer at chess. Then what? What are you doing? Would you believe me if I told you Turk has moods? Obviously not in the sense that you and I understand mood... ...but sometimes I'll feed it a particular chess problem, and it'll solve it one way. The next day, I feed it the same problem and it solves it differently. Once in a while, it can't even solve it at all. -Do you know why it does that? -No. Yeah, neither do I. Someday, I'm gonna figure it out. -Someday, Turk will tell me. -You talk about it like it's human. Well, you never know. What? Too far? What is it? Nothing. Nothing at all. -Do you like this color on me? -What? -I'm a bitch-whore. -What? I have a new friend. Did she tell you, you were a bitch-whore? No. She cried. Wait. What? Okay, what the hell is this thing? Jumper. Outside the gym. Yo, man, check it out. Jump! Jump! Shut up. She's not gonna jump. She's just trying to get attention. -Jump! -Dude, come on. You guys are so mean. That's my new friend. The crying one from the bathroom. When? Two hours, three minutes ago. Four minutes ago. She just wants the attention. She's upset. Her parents are gonna kill her. Did you do anything to her? I tried to give her a tight present. -We gotta help her. Now. -No. I'm going up there. -Let me go. I order you to let me go. -Don't be a freak. Whoa. We gotta go. Now. I could have done something. I was right there. Maybe. Come on, Mom. John, people who wanna take their own lives, this girl... ...if they're serious about it, they'll find a way. You didn't see her. If you'd have seen her, you wouldn't be talking like this. And what were you gonna do, be a hero? Get your name in the papers? Your face? Isn't that what I'm supposed to be? A hero? lsn't that who I am? If it's just gonna sit inside me, just gonna sit in my gut... ...then what are we doing? What's the point? Why not just give it to them if we're gonna act like them? I don't know how to help him. Andy Goode must be killed. Took his eyes, James. They took his freaking eyes. On July 16th, 1945... ...in the mountains outside of Los Alamos, New Mexico... ...the world's first atomic bomb exploded. A white light pierced the sky with such intensity... ...that a blind girl claimed to see the flash from a hundred miles away. After witnessing the explosion... ...J. Robert Oppenheimer quoted a fragment of the Bhagavad-Gita... ...declaring, "I am become death, the destroyer of worlds." His colleague, Ken Bainbridge, put it another way... ...when he leaned close to Oppenheimer and whispered: "Now we are all sons of bitches." Now we are all sons of bitches.
