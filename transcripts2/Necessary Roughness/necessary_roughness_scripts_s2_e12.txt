 Previously, on Necessary Roughness... "T," it's rehab right now, or you will be cut from the New York Hawks. Hi, Terrence. Welcome to Two Oaks. I am not an addict. I am an athlete! The Hawks managed to acquire Joe "Toes" Kittridge just 24 hours ago. What this means for Terrence King, nobody knows. My bro left me a couple of plants, but my yard's too small. You mean weed. Hi, officer. What seems to be the problem?

 You mind stepping out of the car, son? Noelle Sarris, Sportscom3. I'm told you're my handler. You ready to handle me, Donnally? Your office was bugged, so you've suspended your therapy practice? That's right. You are not to help Juliette Pittman. She's Marshall's daughter, not yours. I have strict instructions from your father not to step in again. Marshall Pittman is dead. They found his body. Nico, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

 Sports are about split-second decisions. You going left or right? Gonna get in someone's face or lay back and see what happens? And these choices are made with the crowd screaming and the game going by at the speed of light. Hut! There's the snap. Evans drops back in the pocket, looking to pass. Whoo! Was he inbounds? Touchdown, Hawks! Joe "Toes" Kittridge, the newest addition to this franchise, is making a huge impact on the Hawks' offense. But the worst thing you can do is stop, because once you're frozen, the game will pass you by, and you may never catch up again. ♪ One of these days, the sky's gonna break ♪ ♪ and everything will escape ♪ and I'll know ♪ one of these days, the mountains are gonna fall ♪ ♪ into the sea ♪ and they'll know ♪ never fall away Juliette, I'm sorry about your father. Well... that was fantastic. Oh! I went looking for a yogurt pop and found a fishsicle. Yeah. That's Mr. Fishy. I know that, but are we keeping him around until science can find a way to bring him back to life? No. I just haven't had time to give him a proper burial. Ma, don't you just flush fish? We are not flushing little dude. Ho, ho, ho, bitches. Jolly old Saint dick, wishing everybody a merry rehab. Look at you. Yeah, look at me, but not for too long, lest the brilliance blind you! I got you something. ♪ Do-bi-di-bi-do-do-doo Money clip for Mr. Money Ball. You didn't have to do that. Trust me... I did. Making amends. Glad you're back. The king has returned. Terrence King, as I live and breathe. Oh, what's up, coach?! I have something very special for you, made from real bear... myedvyed. I kill with my own bare hand! Welcome back, Terrence. Thanks, coach. I'm here to work. Good. Suit up. All right! What are you all looking at? Let's get started! There it is. Five minutes! Dr. Santino? Oh! What's up? Haven't seen much of you these past few weeks. I know. I-I have been so unbelievably busy. Have you? Yeah. Okay. Do we need to talk? No. Not until I know what it is that I want to say. And seeing as I don't know what I want to say, then we do not need to talk. What aren't we talking about? Pittman. T.K. What the hell was that? Juliette. Is she breathing? Yeah. Just drunk. Juliette, come on. Wake up. It's just a guess, but if we put the door back together, I bet we'd find the "F." Ladies and gentlemen, meet the new owner of the Hawks. ♪ Work your magic on me Coffee. Electrolytes. I can't eat that. It sops up the alcohol. It takes the edge off the caffeine. And you... look a little thin. Thin is in. Drinking, for you, is not. I wasn't drinking. I had some drinks. So, the reading of the will didn't go as you expected? Daddy left me the team, not the cosmetics company, not the airline... not even a record label. The team. It's worth a billion dollars. Do you know how many birthdays I spent being ignored in a luxury box while my dad doted over his oversized action figures? I hate football. Hate. Hate! Juliette, what can I do to help? She wants to sell the team? Yes. When? Immediately. No. Not gonna happen. Come on... the league will be thrilled with the end of the Pittman era. "Thrilled" doesn't even begin to describe the euphoria. Right. But the Hawks are 3-1, fans are engaged, and there's nothing more important to a professional league than a thriving New York franchise. What this team needs is stability. So you tell Ms. Pittman to go get a couple of hundred facials, and then after the season... Ms. Pittman won't accept after the season. She wants it to happen now. Hank, listen, this girl... ...she's a mess... 10 times worse than Marshall, who at least knew football. How are free agents supposed to take us seriously if our franchise is being run by...our own Paris Hilton? The league picks the buyer, manages the terms. She shows up and, without drama, signs the papers. Can she accept that? I'll let you know. ♪ With the old-school, old-school club ♪ My first question is, why haven't you aged in 10 years? Oh, you're too kind, Dr. Gunner. Hey, please, no. Just "Al" or "Albert." That said, if you're here to get me to change your a-minus in experimental psych, no, no, no. I'm sticking by my earlier ruling. Okay. Sit, sit. Actually, Al, I need to get a referral. I am a bit...stuck. Define "stuck." Uh, there was this incident that forced me to stop seeing clients. And t-the incident is all cleared up, but for some reason, I'm having trouble restarting my practice. It's been over a month, and I honestly don't know why. Hmm. "I don't know" means... means I... I don't want to tell you. There you go. Ah. You taught me that. I did indeed. Maybe it's because my most challenging client is coming out of rehab, and I'm not sure what kind of shape he's gonna be in or because I had a-a dalliance with a co-worker. Or maybe it has something to do with the fish I have in my freezer. What, like tuna, Halibut? Pet-store beta. You're right. It's a good idea. What's a good idea? That you see me. Oh. Oh, no, no. That's not what I was asking you. Oh, come on. Listen, listen. If you wanted a referral, you could have just left a voicemail. No, no. You know that I know that you know what you need is somebody who won't let you off the hook. But I thought that you weren't seeing private clients anymore. Well, I'm not, really... unless they intrigue me. Okay. I've got some time, actually, later today. Oh, yeah, no. That's...no good for me. What could possibly be more important than your mental health? My son's legal issues. 100 hours of picking up roadside trash? I'm a first-time offender, still a minor, okay? Average sentence is only 20 hours. Yeah, well, it's a hell of a lot better than an orange jumpsuit and some cellmate named Spazz or Muscles. You do realize how lucky you got? Yes. And that that could have gone on your permanent record? Yes. And you comprehend how monumentally stupid it was to hide pot plants in my backyard? Ma! Yes! Lucky, yes. Comprehend, yes. Utterly and completely stupid. No! Monumentally stupid. Monumentally stupid. And yes, I'm sorry. And I'm gonna make this right. Uh-huh, 'cause you're gonna do your 100 hours without incident, and then you're gonna do another 20 hours of chores for me just because! How's that sound? Totally fair. All right, let's see it, Terrence. Nice grab, Mr. King. Yeah. Little slow. Trying to make it look pretty. It'd look a lot prettier if you'd have caught that pass in stride. Well, you can't really run and jump at the same time, unless you're in the circus, huh, Toes? Well, no, you wouldn't have to jump if you just ran a 20-yard break instead of cutting it short at 18. I know you are not trying to tell me how to play football. No, I'm just telling you how we got to be the number-one pass offense in the league... precision routes, timing, accountability... that kind of thing. Well, uh, Kittridge, is it? Yeah, listen. I know that in my absence, you became the "toes-t" of the town. Yeah. But, uh, I'm still the king of this castle. Comprendo? Uh, I believe that's "comprende." All right. Special teams in. Offense, take a break. Touché, douché. Offense taking a break... that's a good idea. Full of good ideas. I know Toes could use some haterade! Seems to me that he's dehydra-hated! How's T.K. looking? Better than expected. His attitude? Eh, too early to tell. Well, what are you thinking? You want to play him Sunday? I'm glad to have him back, but the way offense is going, no reason to rush for the Washington game. I agree. Let's keep him in civvies. Yeah. Hey, rock, paper, scissors to see who has to tell him? I got to go. Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change what I can, and the wisdom not to take Toes out and just beat him like a rented government mule. What you smiling about? I'm proud of you. You're working the program. Yeah, I'm working the program. No drinking, no drugs, no sex, not until I can keep Audrey ii here alive for like six months. One case of root rot, and there goes T.K.'s root chakra. My sex life has been reduced to foreplay with a ficus. I don't get it. I have done everything that everybody's told me to do, and I don't feel any better. I feel naked. Mm-hmm. That's exactly where you should be. The way it should be? I... and should I be eating like a pig, too? Is... is that normal? That is your body looking for a dopamine high, which is a hell of a lot better than a dope high. Okay, fine. I am trying to do this right. I really am trying to do this right. But now they're telling me that I can't play? I got to play. I need to play. I-I have to play. I got to do something normal in my life or I will jump out of my skin, doc. You know, can we please start having these sessions back at your office? Fluorescent lights make me look fat. I feel like such a fraud. I have this frozen pet fish in my freezer. My son is... Juvey McJuverson. How am I qualified to help other people? It's like I suddenly feel incapable of doing my job, like I have hit a wall. I don't know. Maybe I'm done with being a therapist. Bullshit. Sorry? Bullshit. We both know you are not going to quit your job, so let's not follow Alice in Pityland down the rabbit hole. Let's get back to the dalliance with the co-worker. Why? Why not? Because it's not the key to my psyche. I-it was an external event. It happened. It's over. Body language. Hmm? Yeah. Okay. Okay. We kissed. And then? And then nothing! Why are you so consumed with this one thing? Because you tried to bury it between the frozen-fish section and your son's brush with the law. Is this how you talk to all of your clients? It's how I talk to my clients who are practicing avoidance. I-I am not avoiding. Aren't you? Oh, come on, come on. No, I-I... wait a minute! Where are you going?! I've got some leftover coq au vin in the fridge and six episodes of "Downton Abbey" on the DVR. But when you're ready to get real, yeah, give me a call, 'cause I'd sure love to schedule another session. She's late. Five minutes. Seven minutes. Are you gonna make a federal case over 120 seconds? We busted our humps to put together potential buyers on her timeline. The least Juliette can do is show up for a meeting. And I have arrived. Uh... oh, no, I don't need to see any of your buyers, because I've already found my own. Come in! Yo, yo! What up, homeys? Is this where I drop my millions at? Hank, Nico, meet Deez Ballz. It's about to go down, bro. Deez Ballz? You expect the league to sell the Hawks to a man named... Dwayne Brewer. Deez Ballz is just his rapper name. The fact that he has a rapper name sums up the whole problem. What he has is a slew of entertainment financiers, all of whom love New York football. Nico, this is not the process we discussed. This is not his process. It's my process, because this is my team. Which you want to sell. After being controlled for the last 23 years by daddy, the last thing I want is for them to treat me the same way. So until I sell, I will hire whoever I like, and I will fire whoever I like. And if I want to sell to Deez Ballz or Dem Ballz or any other kind of ballz, then that's exactly what I'll do. Juliette! Juliette! Juliette. No, no... Oh! Oh, you got to signal before making a u-turn there. Sorry. Sorry. You okay?  Yes. Thank you for asking. Hey, T.K. said that you are not going to dress him for the game. No... football decision. You got to understand that he's just coming out of rehab. It's like he's living with this completely new skin. He's trying to figure out all these new coping skills, which means he really needs... Extra TLC. Yeah. Consider it done. Got to run. Yes, I was avoiding. The dalliance... there was kissing. There was good kissing, and there was about to be more good kissing. And then I had the very good sense to stop it. The good sense? Really? Yep. That's what I just said. Double-arm cross. Who is this fellow? What do you mean? You want to... you want to know his name? Yeah. It's Nico. Nico? So, it was a completely logical choice you made to curtail this Nico activity? Yes. And because of all this good sense, you now have a frozen pet fish and an office in disarray? Yyyyes. No, no, no! You know it's "no"! So if you know it's "no," why are you trying to "yes" me, Danielle? But I don't know. "I don't know," which means you don't want to tell me. 'Round and 'round the circle we go. Where we'll stop, nobody knows. I'm sorry, Dr. Gunner... Al. You suggested that I come to you, and you know that I am dealing with a lot. The least that you can do is be a little bit nice to me. Okay. She wants nice. She wants nice. Okay, well, Dr. Jenx will give you nice. Good luck, Danielle. "Downton Abbey," here I come. Is this the Santino residence? It is. I'm looking for a Dr. Danielle Santino. Well, yeah, yeah, you have the right place, but she's not home. Oh. Got any ice cream? Yeah. Community service, huh? Been there. Yeah? Oh, yes. First time for a "five finger discount" incident, then for a "stealing a car" incident, then for "I don't remember" incident. Anyway, the last time, I volunteered tutoring at-risk kids for one of my mom's charities. I thought it was gonna be really lame, but it ended up being kind of enlightening. Yeah, well, I pick up trash on the side of the road, so...less enlightenment, more candy wrappers and empty beer cans. It doesn't matter. Just trying to do my time and be done. Yeah, I was doing the same thing... trying to get some distance from my family when I got knocked off my path. I'm sorry about your, uh, your dad. You and me both. So you're... you're here to see my mom? Yeah. I'm hoping she can... Fill in some details for me. Details for...? A lot of things. So, butterscotch, huh? I don't think I know anyone under the age of 70 who does the butterscotch. Okay, don't yuck my yum. Don't what my who? Yuck my yum. Santino family rule, okay? It's okay not to like something, but don't go yucking someone else's yum. All right. Mm-hmm. Give me a taste. Come on. I'm not afraid of cooties, so... Okay. ♪ All of your fears Mmm. Definitely some yum in there. Ray Jay? Hey, mom. You know Juliette Pittman, right? Hello. Hello. Yo. What's up? Oh, great. Like deactivating me wasn't enough? You got to come trash my house now, too? Come on. Just came by to see how you're doing. You know what? Other than the fact that I just committed an act of vegicide, I'm peachy. How much you watering this thing? Every three hours. Um... Think it needs more? No. No, no, no. I think it needs... Less of your attention. Why don't we, uh, we go out, grab a bite to eat? I already ate. Yeah... pie and doughnuts. Skittles? Come on. Let's get out of here. I don't know what... I can't go to a bar 'cause of the drinks. Can't go to a nightclub because all the vajayjay. I mean, I want to go somewhere. I want to get out the house, for sure. But I just can't think of anyplace safe that I can go. I got the perfect spot. So, you not playing me... that some sort of punishment? Not at all. It's going in! Yeah! Oh, wow. Good. Good for you. Golf clap. Hey, it's not a punishment, all right? We're just trying to put you in the best position to succeed. The be...  I don't need to be positioned. This is Washington. Rolando Sheldon is the cover corner. That's my bitch. I smoked his ass last year. I know. 103 yards. And a touchdown. I remember. Okay, well, this is not right, Matt. Toes should be the guy on the sidelines trying to get in the game, not me. And you got me over in the sidelines now, just... just trying to figure out how to... Live in your new skin, bro. That's all. Sound like the good doc. Something's up with her. What do you mean? I mean, you know... you ever wonder what she's doing when she's not being shrinky dink? I mean, she got to have somebody in her life, you know? I don't know. Possibly. You ever think she's hitting it with somebody in the organization? Where you going with this, "T"? My money's on Nico. Nico? That's all I'm saying. I don't think so. Eh! That boy a pimp! I'm trying to tell you. You're backseating it. Mm-hmm. New rule. There's got to be one leather seat between us at all times. Hmm. You...ready to talk? Mm-hmm. About Juliette. Pittman? No... Romeo and Juliet. Yeah, Juliette Pittman, who showed up at my house and then proceeded to grill me about her mother and her father. What about them? "Was it true that her mother was in love with another man?" And you said...? I said... That I wasn't Marshall's therapist because he was my boss and that I couldn't be her therapist because now she's my boss and that I'm incredibly overdrawn at the Hawks bank of interpersonal relationships, thank you. You said that? No. In my head, I said it... in my head. Look, Dani... Nico, you keep that girl away from my son, okay? The Pittmans can spray their chaos all over me, but ray Jay is doing his best to clean up his act, and I will not have him messed with. Am I loud? Am I clear? You are both. Thank you. I know what I want. Let me know if you're in. Dani, I've never let you down. Nico... you're not alone. I have wasted a lot of time with the wrong women. Lindsay? The lamp slipped. Sorry. Did you... do all this? I wanted to surprise you. I thought that if you got up in the morning and your office was all nice that maybe you could restart your practice or...maybe also bury Mr. Fishy. Honey, we're gonna bury Mr. Fishy. I promise you. When? Soon. Dr. Gunner! Dr. Gunner! Oh, hello, Danielle. So, how was your session with Dr. Jenx? Was she nice? I didn't go to Dr. Jenx. I don't want to go to Dr. Jenx. I want you to help me bury my fish, damn it! Ooh! You're angry. Pbht! You think? And what is anger? Anger is a response to being hurt, which I know because I learned it in your classes. But what I don't know is why you seem to be going out of your way to make me utterly nuts! I... mnh! If you know something, then tell me. And if you don't, then enough already. Let me let you in on a little secret. I don't know anything. But you do. You're getting very, very close, Danielle. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Very close. Yeah, but...to what? Close to what?! I got your message. What can I do for you, Hank? Mark Cuban's upped his offer. The league's ready to move. Well, as I think you saw, Juliette is not in the mind-set to move. And it's that mind-set that's the problem in a nutshell, Nico. She disappeared after yesterday's meeting, and for all we know, she could be on another binge. Where is she, anyway? You got a problem, Donnally? We both do, Mr. Careles. This is way over your head, and it's certainly over hers. Probably just a matter of time before she goes off the deep end, like her father. Now, I've heard the rumors... Nico the protector, Nico the surrogate father. I suggest you back the hell up. Get her to agree to the Cuban offer, or the league will get the lawyers involved. It'll take time, but we can get her charter invalidated. We'll need her answer by the end of the day. I've been calling you. I'm not home! Listen, I need your help on... you okay? No, I am not. I don't understand... anything right now. Understanding is overrated. Not for therapists. Okay. Look. It's been my view in life to keep things real simple. Anything that can't be explained in four words... not worth thinking about. Why did you kiss me? Because you needed to. Why'd I kiss you? Because I wanted to. What happens next? Remains to be seen. Why should you get up and help me with Juliette Pittman? It's what you do. Nico, I am in no position... she needs someone to talk to. She hasn't answered my calls. She's frozen me out. She sent me a text. It said "Good-bye." As we enter the second half of this game, you have to ask, what has happened to the Hawks' offense? They have been completely shut down by a Washington defense that, before today, hasn't been able to stop anyone. Given how the offense has sputtered, you have to wonder if the Hawks regret not playing Terrence King. What's up, ladies? How you doing? Hot dogs. Get your hot dogs. Polish hot dogs right here. Yo, hot dog dawg. Yeah, you... the guy with the box of hot dogs. Yo. I want two. You want two hot dogs... down there? You're the only dude carrying a box of hot dogs, right? What are you doing? Ordering hot dogs. I can see that. But the game's out there, and we're losing. Oh, are we? That sucks. First down... Mm! Boom! Whoo! Hands like these, maybe one day, I'll be a receiver. Will you girls excuse us for one second, okay? That is Polish. Mmm. "T," if you're gonna pull stunts like this, I don't want you on the field. It's not a stunt, dawg. I'm hungry. Yeah... for attention. I want to be on your side, Terrence. I really do. And I get that you don't like Toes. That's fine. You're both competitors. But I have spent the entire season trying to keep this team from sinking, and you keep throwing water in the boat and leaving me to bail it out. And, I'm 35 days sober. And you guys keep taking the one thing that means anything to me, which is football. Yeah, you're 35 days sober. And one thing remains the same... that no matter what's going on, it's always about you. Hey, hey. Uh, just give me a second alone with her. Hey, Juliette. Carol and Herbert gable. I've decided that he ran a laundromat and she raised birds. Juliette, have you taken anything? My father was mentally ill. It's genetic, right? Yes, mental illness can be hereditary, but it can also be treated. So if that's something that you think yore struggling with, then we can get you help. But I need to know if you've taken anything. And I need to know if I'm gonna drive a plane into the ocean. Why would he leave me the one thing he knew I'd despise? Because... It was also one of the things that he loved. And, Juliette, maybe, in his limited way, he was trying to tell you how he felt. Everything's changing. And I don't know what to do or how to feel. Your father's gone, and I know that's hard. But... you're still here. You have your whole life ahead of you. You just need to decide what you're gonna do with it. I didn't take anything. Time is running out for the Hawks, with only 23 seconds left in the game. The offense really needs to get the ball in Kittridge's hands, but Sheldon has had his number all day. Second and 10. ♪ It's so lonely lately ♪ nothing turns me on Hut! Hawks drop back to pass, looking for the win. Kittridge jammed by Sheldon at the 15. Evans... nowhere to pass and nowhere to go. And down goes Evans... a 5-yard loss, bringing up a key third down for the Hawks, time out. I'll take that now. T.K.! Donnally, what the hell's he doing? I don't know. I don't know. - Toes. Toes. - T.K.! Sheldon is favoring his right shoulder. He comes up to the line nose up, but he resets before the snap on the right side outside. You swim off that shoulder, you have real estate today. He's rip and dip. All right, so you're gonna tell me how to play football? That's good. Yeah. I'm telling you how to get the "W." All right. You know you don't belong out here, T.K. That's what everybody keeps telling me. And it all comes down to this, folks. I can't hear myself think over the roar of this crowd. 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter. Hawks down by 4, and only enough time to run one more play. Evans brings them to the line. It is now or never, folks. There it is. Rip and dip. Hut! The ball is snapped. Evans drops back in the pocket, looking to pass. Kittridge breaks away from Sheldon at the 20-yard line! Touchdown! Touchdown, Hawks! Hawks win! Yeah, baby! Precision routes, timing, and accountability. Yeah! Joe. Joe. Joe. Joe. Man, Sheldon had you locked up all day. Oh, no, no. How did you finally break away in the end? I noticed he was favoring his shoulder. He was coming to the line nose up. Kept resetting to the outside right before the snap. All it took was a little dip, little rip, get that extra step I needed, and, man, the rest is history. All right, man. Well, good game. Thank you, brother. All right, all right, all right! All right! Whoo! Damn. This fool's head is almost as big as yours. Game on, dawg. Game on. Right on time. Didn't want to keep you waiting. The league has thoroughly vetted this offer, but I'm sure your lawyers will want to go over everything with a fine-tooth comb. Having said that, we'd like a commitment from you to enter into a good-faith negotiation with the intention to sell to Mr. Cuban. Looks amazing. Thank you. I'll expect you to clean out your office and exit the facility by the end of the day. You're fired. If this is about Deez Ballz... I'm not selling to Dwayne brewer. I'm not selling to mark Cuban. I'm not selling to anyone. I'm keeping the team. Which is...I guess, what my dad wanted. She can't do this. The league's takeover of the Hawks was Marshall's choice. That agreement is no longer applicable. Let me know when he's gone. Hey, I'm running...  You got a minute? Oh. Two seconds? Sure. Thank you. Look, Dani, I know we're keeping things professional, which isn't easy all the time. So I got to ask you a question. Is there something going on with you and Nico? Me and Nico? It's not a trick question. True. But it's a question that I'm not sure you have the right to ask me... same as I don't have the right to ask who you were in bed with the night that T.K. went AWOL from rehab. It's not the same. Isn't it, though? No, 'cause I'm not asking about someone random. I'm asking about Nico. I am not involved with Nico, Matt. The phone rang... The night of the dalliance. We kissed, me and Nico. We were kissing. We were...still kissing, just frantically kissing up the stairs, and then the phone rang. Saved by the bell. Saved by the police station. So, my son got arrested, and I had to go bail him out. Ah. But the truth is, if that phone had not rung, then I would have just dragged him up to my bed. And that scares you? What scares me is that I'm caught between the man that I love... that I cannot have... And the man that I am... dangerously attracted to... that I shouldn't have. So I'm at this crossroads, and I can't take either path. Can't you? Restart your practice, bury your fish, and simply embrace the fact that being a therapist doesn't make you immune from being human. You do that, and we can really dig in. How does Thursday at 4:00 sound?
