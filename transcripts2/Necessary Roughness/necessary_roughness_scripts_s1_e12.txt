 We're gonna have a big problem, big man. And off-the-field dramas. ♪ Give me what I need ♪ But the thing about minefield's... no matter how many you manage to navigate, the most dangerous is always the one that you don't see coming. And here come the Hawks to the line of scrimmage. About a minute left in the first half. Hawks driving at the Chicago 20, trailing by 7. - Go T.K.! - Whoo! Whoo! About to put this blanket on your sorry, choking ass. Then, I'm putting you to bed.

 I'm your worst nightmare, T.K. Ain't got nothing but sweet dreams, baby. Hut! Look at all this swag. Mm-hmm. Hey, can I take Winter? Mnh-mnh. No Winter. We only have four tickets. You, me, Ray Jay, and Margo. Ray Jay's coming with us? Yeah, why wouldn't he come with us? - Hello. - Hi! Who's ready to kick some serious windy city butt? Hmm. Well, playoffs are for kids who don't fail their classes, so beat it, vamoose, pronto. Yes, mother. Well, as inviting as that sounds, I think I just lost my appetite. These are from Ray's lawyers. And what's the latest? Come on. What did the S.O.B. do now? Oh, that S.O.B. signed the divorce papers. Like that one stroke of the pen, you're free and clear? Uh-huh. Yep. Want to be my witness? Y-yeah. Okay. Thanks. Wow. That's 17 years and just... All gone. Easier than I thought. Congratulations! Let's go! Let's go! 42 right. 42 right. Mocus, I want to see you on T.K. T.K., split out right. You ain't got nothing on me but years, Mocus. - Don't get served, now. Don't get served. - You ain't got nothing on T.K., baby. - Don't get served, homeboy. - All day. Stay with it! Stay with it! Come on. Finish your damn route, King. Yo, T, what's up, man? What do you need? I need a drink. What kind of drink? Rough practice today, T.K.? Reports are, you checked out early, skipped out on a blocking drill. That's 'cause you don't pay this sexy body to throw blocks you know what I'm saying? That's like using fine China as a door stop. That's a no-no. I don't have to practice at being king of my own world. You know what I'm saying? T.K., this is the first playoff game in your career. Any jitters? Girl, please. I give coffee the jitters. What about the Minefield? Huh? The who? Maurice Manningfield, cornerback for Chicago. Five head-to-heads, and you have exactly 30 yards and zero touchdowns off him. Uh, is there a question in there somewhere? Yeah, how do you keep a guy like that out of your head? Not in my head. Looks like he's kind of in your head. You know what I'm saying? Maybe you got a picture of him framed right by your bed next to your lotion and your tissues. So you're saying you don't have a problem with the Minefield even though he shut you down your entire career? T.K., you're from Newark. Yes, I am from Newark, and as we hablo in Newark adios, bitches. I'm gonna give t-pain something to cry about to that therapist of his. On Sunday, homey catches that ball, his ass is gonna go boom. That's if he catches the ball. Are y'all hearing me? Boom! I hope you're watching, T.K. I hope you're watching. Boom? His trademark. This is the Minefield. What's the Minefield? Maurice Manningfield. He's a cornerback for Chicago. And T.K.'s nemesis. Months of therapy, God only knows how many thousands of dollars and now T.K.'s hearing footsteps. Huh? It means he's always looking over his shoulder. He thinks someone's there to hit him when no one's there. Well, I'm here. I'll hit him... repeatedly. Biggest game of his career... Hell, all of our careers... And... And he's a head case again. You're the shrink. Stop him from shrinking. Geez. So much for playoff fever. Well, they don't call it a fever for nothing. There are some serious side effects. Um, can we, um... can we talk for a sec about the kiss? Oh, we have just talked this thing to death. Analyzed it, psycho-analyzed it. That's what I do. Dani, look, one way or another, the season ends in a couple of weeks. And you're solid here, so I just want to know are we doing this? Well, can we have... - Dinner? - Yeah. - Saturday. - Great. Good. Good talk. I thought there was a fetid smell of juris doctor coming from this room. - Marshall wants to talk. - Did he forgot how to use a phone? About what's going on with Gabrielle. Look, Devin, I don't really want to search through the Pittmans' dirty laundry. Gabrielle's filing for divorce. She's going after the Hawks. And as Marshall's chief counsel, I've advised him to make a preemptive strike. Great morale booster. We can hand out copies of the court docs along with pennants and hats. So, we're looking for leverage. You really think she's gonna settle? Depends on what you find, right? We want anything that will leave a mark... Her finances... Any backroom dealings with the league... Other men. I'll see what I can dig up. Good. It's important to Marshall this is done right. You and I are the only people he trusts. Oh, Nico. To what do I owe the honor? Jail time? Strip club? Ooh. If it's about Terrence, I'm seeing him tomorrow. It's not... about T.K. Is Booz okay? - Or Bobby Caldwell? - Someone new. Got them out there? Who's the client? Me. ♪ Baby, work your magic on me ♪ Necessary Roughness Season 1, Episode 12 Goal Line September 14, 2011 sync by gatto, corrections by dcdah for www.addic7ed.com A dollar? Makes me an official patient. Ah, which makes this conversation privileged and confidential. Unless, of course, you killed someone. You haven't... killed someone, have you? Recently? No. Audio scrambler. Desensitizes all wiretaps in a 150-foot radius. What is this? Libya or Long Island? Why would anybody bug me? 38% of the United States is monitored by some form of audio surveillance. Oh. Well, now you're just freaking me out. What's going on? I find myself in a situation... where I feel compelled to lie. Okay. So... people sometimes find themselves in that situation... Not me. What is it that you feel compelled to lie about? I can't tell you that. Are there others involved in the lie? I can't tell you that either. Is it personal or does this have do with the Hawks? If I lie, life stays the same. If I don't... everything changes. Will you be the only person affected if you choose to lie? I'm not going to tell you. You're not gonna tell me that. Nico... What are you "hiring" me for? Clarity. Okay. You say you never lie. I don't. Then you have to ask yourself what is causing you to compromise yourself in this situation? Who are you protecting and why? And is the compromise something that you will regret doing or regret not doing? Did you tell mom about the game yet? She's gonna go volcanic. It's not that big a deal, drama queen. Then why haven't you told her yet? Look, they signed the divorce papers. It's done. Yeah, it's done... for them. "Let me know if you're in." Wow. That's hot. - I know. - It is. So, are you in? I don't know. I mean, I just came off this thing with J.D. Oh, J.D. Shmaydee. You had a couple dates... J.D. was not a keeper. But Matt... Matt moved boxes for you. Yeah, but what is a keeper, Margo? Seriously, Ray was supposed to be my keeper, and he just turned out to be a total... bleeper. Well, to love, you got to leap. Donut? Yeah, but sometimes when you leap, you fall down... hard. So I guess you should just stay on the ledge then, forever, until you're old, alone, and bitter with cats. You're so mean. I thought I was dying. And when did it start? The other day in practice. - When you left early? - Yeah. Coach put "Hocus Pocus" Mocus on me, to be the scout team's Minefield. What's a scout team? It basically means that Mocus would do whatever the Minefield's gonna do... Run his mouth, rough me up, you know, try to get in my head... Don't get served, homeboy. Except my head wouldn't shut the hell up. Finish your damn route, King. It kept screaming about last season when Manningfield hopped my route and snatched one down, took it back for a pick-six. Or two years ago in Chicago when I blew a hot route or the time this douche bag separated my shoulder... and I believe on purpose... my rookie year. And I just keep thinking... He's here. He's got his sights set on 88, and he is gunning for my ass. It was like the dude was everywhere. And my heart is beating so fast it feels like it's about to pop out of my chest. I can't hear anything, and I can't breath. It feels like I'm choking. T.K., yeah, it's me. Boom. I-I need a drink. You were having a physiological reaction to your thoughts and your fears. It's a... it's a panic attack. A nuclear panic attack, biological combat. It was like world war III going off inside of my helmet, doc. This is not normal. Okay, but why him? I don't know. Come on, now. I... no, it doesn't... no, no, no. Honestly, this time, I really do not know why this... this one guy makes... he spooks me. He really spooks me. Doc, I can't be having any more of these damn attacks, not on the field, especially in front of my crew. Well, the first step is recognizing what's happening to you, right, and that you are not in any actual danger, that you are more powerful than the panic. You breathe through it, then it subsides. Second step is to figure out why him, why now? A nighttime meeting in the middle of nowhere? If it wasn't you, I'd be worried this was some sort of hit. I need to know everything that could be used against you. Marshall told you to dig. I bet he gave you a shovel, too. I can't protect you if I don't know what you need protection from. What do I need to know? Everything you're gonna find, Marshall already knows. Except one thing. The scariest skeleton in my closet... is you. What are you looking at? I thought we were past the wandering-eye stage of our relationship. Oh, no. Baby, I'm not looking at chicks, okay? I just... I just feel like everybody's looking at me. That's usually what you want. Hey, how about you focus on me. - You're good for me, you know that? - I do. - Oh, you do? - I do. You're so humble. Boom! What up, T-Bag? Hello, Mini-Dick? Word is you're already hearing footsteps. You ain't even gotten near the Minefield yet? We're just trying to have a peaceful drink over here, brother. Okay, brother. I can respect that. Hey. After I drop your ass on the field, how about you drop Miss Vivica's ass back at the hotel? - Terrence, please, no. - I got this. I got this. Yo, dawg, you can't just... T.K.? He's gonna choke on Sunday anyway. Might as well get it out the way now. T.K., it's 3:00 in the morning. Come to bed. Did you call Dr. Santino? You're on a... Hawks message board? Chi-town warrior wrote, "Post is reporting "that T.K. almost choked at Club Domo tonight "if he can't face the Minefield in a bar, he damn sure can't face him on a field." And look what this fool Cheesebeef wrote. It's not even original. "The Minefield's gonna beat T.K. like a red-headed stepchild." That's ridiculous. And you respond... "I'm gonna beat your fat Chicago face." Two typos in Chicago. Score that round for Beefcheese. Cheesebeef. T.K., people have panic attacks. I'm not people. I'm Terrence Freaking King. T.K. attacks. He doesn't get attacks, okay? This is all over the damn Internet, Viv. Yeah, well, if it wasn't this, it would be something else. It's an insatiable beast. You did a story on the Minefield a couple months back, right? - Jesus, T.K. - No, no, no. For real. I just want to know how that went for you guys. Terrence, I write a lot of stories about a lot of athletes, and I don't sleep with them. You slept with me. God, you let this guy get so far in your head, there's no more room for me. I'm out. You can't answer the question? Quite a pair, those Pittmans. She's been short selling the stock, storing cash in every offshore account from here to Timbuktu. Anything else? She drinks. Who doesn't? She's meddled in the GM''s office. She loves football. Whose side we on here? Any affairs? Him, yeah. Her, well... There's smoke, but can't I find the fire. No names. She's pretty stealth... not a stupid lady. But you got to wonder, with their history... if that kid's really his. - Hey, mom. - Hey, Mikey. - Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? - Yeah, hold on. All right. All yours. What's up? The playoff game... Mm-hmm. You can give my ticket away. What? Dad and I always talked about going to the game if we ever got to the playoffs. Hawks was something I always did with him, and... he has tickets. Oh, wait. So you want to go to the game with dad? I thought we had a whole plan. No, no. You had a plan. No, I knew it. I knew you would make me feel guilty about this. No, no, no, no. I'm not trying to make you feel anything. Hey, where is this coming from? You signed the divorce papers, and that means freedom for you. But every year for the rest of my life, I have to decide who to spend Christmas with, who to spend Thanksgiving with, who to go to a playoff game with. And with every one of those choices, I get disappointment from somebody. I will always be disappointing you. Thanks for that. No, no. Ray Jay... Ray Jay, wait! Hey, hey, hey. Oh. Oh! Jesus! You. Thanks for taking my text. Mall parking lot... odd spot for therapy. Maybe I just feel more comfortable talking in a car. You know, I like the seats. Nice leather. Okay. Talk to me. Music. Music? Audio surveillance. Oh, boy. Please say a command. Bluetooth audio. Play next track. Ta-da. I was involved with Gabrielle Pittman. Before she met Marshall. Okay. And it didn't stop... then. Has it stopped now? I don't know. So...you did compromise yourself... for her. Lie by omission is still a lie, Nico. It's complicated. Marshall saved my life once. And now you're in love with his wife? You don't need a therapist. You need a friend. ♪ Just a flicker of light glows ♪ ♪ as the candle burns ♪ ♪ and I'll pour another ♪ ♪ just to make it hurt ♪ ♪ I hear my own eyes blink ♪ The breadstick rule is in effect until the salads come. Mm! Okay, the timing of all this... Are you in? Are you out? Is something going on that I don't know about, like are you dying? I've been offered a job. In San Francisco next season. Oh, wow. Congratulations. You know, coach wants to keep me, but, look, I got to tell you, with this big fight between the Pittmans and then his lead attorney showing up at the practice facility, something big's going down. And any and everything could blow up for this team. I get it. So I'm asking myself all the hard questions. W-well, I ask myself those every day and never get any answers. Well, here's mine. New York's my home. It's where I want to live. My career... The Hawks are my team. I'd like to stay in this organization. Personally... I have wasted a lot of time with the wrong women. And I'm ready to be with the right one. Matt... Go ahead. Terrence? Whoa, whoa, whoa. A-are you okay? Terrence? Terrence? Dr. D? Oh, boy. You are... Drunk. You know, I thought about... dragging your ass back to Atlantic city. Those were our good old days, right? No. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I haven't left the apartment. I stepped in a Minefield something good, doc. And, boom, I'm all blowed up. Playoffs... That's everything I've ever wanted, you know? Every coach would just... you know, they'd be like, "one day, T.K." And that one day is here, and... I'm all mixed up, doc. I just... I mean, what... what happens if I have a panic attack during the game? You'll recognize the signs. And you'll get control. In front of 100 million people? Mm-hmm. I want you to breathe the way that I taught you. Good. I'm alone. What about Vivica? I ruined it. Just like I ruin everything. Listen. Hey. I am in section 134... Row 7, seat 5. That's where I will be. I am there for you no matter what. Hello, sports fans, welcome to the Hawks' playoff pregame. Will the Hawks advance to the second round? Can the Hawks' front four stop the Chicago run? And is Terrence King in it to win it or in for a fall? We are gonna discuss all that and more... Shut your blow hole. Mom, I think I'm gonna ride with Ray Jay to the game. Come on, Linz. Oh, uh, hold on. Hold on. Guys, uh... Listen... You know that dad and I signed the divorce papers, and that means different things for all of us. I'm not gonna try and put a Pollyanna spin on it. You are disappointed in dad and me that we couldn't work it out. And I'm disappointed that I won't get to spend every holiday with you. But I never want you to apologize for wanting to spend time with your father. That's it. That's all I wanted to say. Well, we should really go, mom. And here come the Hawks to the line of scrimmage. About a minute left in the first half. Hawks driving at the Chicago 20, trailing by 7. - Go, T.K.! - Whoo! Whoo! It's been a rough first half for King and the Hawks. No doubt. Minefield has had his number all day long. I'm about to put this blanket on your sorry, choking ass, then I'm putting you to bed. I'm your worst nightmare, T.K. I ain't got nothing but sweet dreams, baby. ♪ Pack your bags light ♪ ♪ it's time to leave your dreams ♪ ♪ we all know you got to get awake ♪ ♪ and we'll go to the little hideaway ♪ Manningfield has just taken T.K. completely out of this game. Boom! Get up! Shouldn't be called T.K. You might want to change that to "queen." "T.K.," my ass. Me and you all day. Boom! It's gonna be like this all day, baby. All day. Something seems to be wrong with King. He is not heading back to the huddle. Get your game up, baby. Minefield. Shut down. Terrence! Hey. So, T.K. Says that he can't get his arm up above his head, - that he's done. - But you think he can play? He's got to get back out there. Oh, Matt... Dani, this is not for the team. This is for Terrence. 'Cause if he doesn't get back out there, with the half that he's had in the playoffs, he's gonna be labeled a quitter for the rest of his career. All right, second half's starting. I got to get back. In there. Oh, uh, hey. Did you get... clarity? I can't compromise myself... For anyone. I'm done. He beat me. He beat you? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Well, I just... I don't think that you're afraid of the Minefield. Or not the one in the Chicago uniform. Stop playing games, doc. If you got the answers, give them to me! Terrence... for the first time ever, you have something to lose. Before we first met, you did whatever you wanted whenever you wanted, damn the consequences, right? Yeah. And I felt a hell of a lot better than the hot mess you're looking at right now. But I don't see a mess. I see a man who's worked hard to get the fans to love him, his teammates to believe in him, a woman to care about him. Hey, you are right at the goal line, about to get everything you've ever wanted. Shouldn't it be easier? Yeah, it should. It should be easier, but... It isn't. Even if you were to run out there and beat the Minefield, there is always gonna be something, whether it's next week's game or another spat with a fan, a fight with Vivica, or... or even another panic attack. The minefields of life never go away. We just get better at navigating our way through them. What if I don't? Hmm? What if I never beat the attacks? What if this is it for me? I-it's the last game of my career? All right. Let us assume for a moment that that was true. How would you play the last game of your career? I'd leave it all on the field. Okay. Then you're gonna get up, you're gonna get out there, and you're gonna do that. So, here we go... Start of the fourth quarter. Hawks still trailing by 4, and still no sign of Terrence King. Ray Jay, what are you doing here? Hey. Lindsay's sitting with dad in this half. We decided, for the game... joint custody. Too cute. So, what'd I miss? We got a field goal to cut the score to 20-16, and we're driving. Hey, this game is not over until I say it's over! Come on! Go, hawks! ♪ If you please ♪ ♪ I won't stay begging long ♪ Oh! Look, there's T.K.! Here comes Terrence King out of the tunnel. Of course, we still have no word yet on his status or whether Purnell is going to put him back in the game. Well, the Hawks' could certainly use him if he's healthy. It looks like T.K. is pleading his case with coach Purnell right now. ♪ So sick and tired of this misery I've known ♪ Look at that... Purnell's put T.K. Back in the game. I guess he's good to go. Well, let's see if it makes any difference to the Hawk's anemic offense. ♪ At the bottom of this hill ♪ ♪ I got dead flowers on my windowsill ♪ ♪ baby stole her eyes from a siamese cat ♪ Hut! ♪ She got the appetite from a vampire bat ♪ ♪ now that you're crying and you're feeling all alone ♪ ♪ baby, oh, baby, come on home ♪ 6 seconds left on the clock. The Hawks have driven all the way to the Warrior 40-yard line. No time-outs remaining. Ready? And here they come in a three-wide-receiver set, T.K. Has been ineffective all day, but the Hawks need him to step it up right now. Should have stayed in the locker room, T.K. Boom! Last play of your season, baby... you and me. Yellow 1-4! Hut! Quarterback takes the snap. Looks downfield. T.K. Is open. But, no, the ball is dumped down to Nelson at the 35. Nelson bounces off a tackle, and now he has some running room. But here comes the Minefield! He's got Nelson dead to rights. ♪ Baby, oh, baby, come on home ♪ Wow! What a hit! Terrence King comes out of nowhere and decks the Minefield! Hawks win! Hawks win, 22-20! B-double-o-m... Bitch. Unbelievable block by Terrence King. Star wide receiver leveling a cornerback like that, you don't see that every day. That's got to be the play of the year. It certainly is in my book. The most explosive hit of the afternoon and the whole playoffs diffused the bomb. ♪ Won't you come on home? ♪ ♪ won't you come on home? ♪ T.K.! T.K.! T.K.! T.K.! T.K.! T.K., that was some block you threw on Manningfield. What happened out there? I saw Manningfield, and I decided to detonate 50 tons of King's explosives on his bitch ass. You know you're gonna hear it from the organization and the fans about your early exit. Yeah, you're right. I will hear it from the organization and the fans. And whatever the consequences, I'll take them like a man. The one thing you got to know about T.K. is I don't always get it right the first time. But if you give me a second chance, I'll do everything in my power to make sure... that I make it up to y'all. Uh, give me a second, y'all. Hey, yo, Viv? Hey. Listen, so, um, we're gonna go out and celebrate after this, if you want to join. Let me think about it. Well, I'll keep a seat warm for you and... some hope. Like, a lot of hope. - Hey. - Hi! Dad asked if we could spend the night. He's getting ribs from Benny's. But, you know, we don't have to. Oh, no. You should go. And tell dad I said hello. - All right. - Thanks, mom. You're welcome. Bye. - See ya. - Have a good time. We will. Hey! - Hey! - Aah! You blew him up! Was there ever a doubt? It's been a hell of a season, doc. But it's not over yet. Still got a couple to go. And I'm sure I'll keep you busy. Oh! Mwah! Baby boy! Boom! Dr. Dani. Come here! The great Santino does it again. Mm! Hi. Listen... I think I know what scares me about us. You could be a keeper. Look, you screw up with a creeper, who cares? Big whoop. But with a... a good guy... You could look back on that and regret it forever. So... Too scary? Just scary enough. Quite a game. Yes, it is. So, did you find anything... Dig-worthy? Gabrielle, I want you to look me in the eye. She's not yours. Juliette. But all these years, you wanted me to assume that she was. Yeah, it was wishful thinking on my part. So... Who gets Nico... In the Pittman custody battle? Devin? Gabrielle? You wanted to know what I found? What the hell is going on here? This some kind of joke? Oh, and you wanted to know about affairs. There were several... One in particular... who she was in love with. And he was in love with her. If Marshall wants to know the name... Tell him to call me. I'll give it to him myself. Oh, my God! This is so weird! I've been dreaming about this. Me, too. I mean, dreaming about this exactly. You standing there, me sitting here. I've been dreaming about this. Oh, so you're saying that you already know the ending. Well, there's a lot of possible endings. Pick your favorite. Let's go with that one. ♪ So, when the seas give up ♪ ♪ oh, when the road gets long ♪ Whoo! Hawks in the building! Hey, yo! First round is on conference-title-bound Terrence King! - Hey! - Whoo! Whoo! Hey, T.K.! Your block was all dumb luck. You're still a loser. You're always gonna be a loser. I think, uh, namaste, and you should enjoy the win. Uh, see, I'm a Chicago fan. Ah. You no-talent ass-clown! W-w-whoa. W-w-w-wait. It's all good. It's all good. "Ass-clown." That's a good one. I like that. You know, a few months ago, I'd have taken that finger, broken it off, and shoved it up your ass and given you a prostate exam. But tonight is your lucky night. 'Cause I'm ask you to calmly vacate the premises so I can say "What's up?" to that lovely lady over there. Scoreboard! Ow! Take your ass back to Chicago. Viv, what's up, baby? Hey, T.K.! What's the score now? Oh. Nico. - Dr. Santino. - Oh, now's not a good time. - There's been an incident. - What do you mean, an incident? What's wrong, Nico? Something happened... to T.K. He's been shot. Preuzeto sa www.titlovi.com
