 Previously on Necessary Roughness... It's my one-year anniversary of sobriety. You know, that means the King is free to shwing again. Terrence. Sheera. I'm a model. Are you happy here? I'm happier now. You suggested we hack into their system. I didn't think we'd pull it off. Instead of having one man on the inside, now we have two. Mr. Careles -- he's opaque to most

 but transparent when he looks at you. Hey, I got a proposition for you. Come to Idaho with us. I got to make some goofy speech. Wheels up in four hours. ♪ Come on So, Sun Valley? Amazing? It was. I made a lot of great contacts. Ooh, tell. Well, I met the Google guys and the YouTube guys and the guy that invented the Segway. Cool. Um, any other "contacts"? Oh, God. What are you, pimping or assisting? I'm assisting you... to a little fun. What are you talking about? I am totally capable of fun.

 I have tons of it. Okay, I do your calendar, and since you've started this job, all I see is tons of empty space on tons of nights. Right. Well, that calendar is not accurate completely. Mm. What are you doing? What are you typing? G.N.O. -- V3 girls night out. Agents, assistants. Girls only. You should come... If you're free. How about we focus on today's calendar. This morning. Nolan Powers. The self-help guru? One in the same. But according to his books, he doesn't even believe in therapy. And Connor is sending him to me? No, Connor is sending you to him. Snap out of it. "Paths to power"... Is about believing in yourself. Never say, "I can't." The power lies in you to shape and mold and bend your destiny to your will. You see, we focus too much on our weaknesses. That's why I just say no to therapy. There's too much talk and not enough action. You talk and you talk until you make your therapist wealthy. You see, therapy, to me, is like the prison industry. It's a life sentence. I guess you won't be buying his book anytime soon. Not unless I run out of firewood. I, like many of you, suffered abuse as a child. Pitifully plump -- I was ridiculed. I used to binge on pizzas and hot dogs and cupcakes, and then pizzas with hot dogs and cupcakes for toppings. I couldn't see my feet, but I'd whine -- "Why can't I get a girlfriend? Why can't I get a job?" I had to wipe that sauce from my eyes, take a good, hard look in the mirror. I had to destroy those weaknesses, ignore those voices, and... Snap out of it. Come on, now. Don't be shy. Ignore those voices and -- what is it? Snap out of it! One more time. I couldn't quite hear you. Snap out of it! Whoo! Thank you, everybody. Nolan Powers! Great job! You want some? Come get some. What -- oh, no, no, no! Oh, my God. You are way stronger than you look. Mm, poor baby. You want me to stop? Mm. ♪ Pieces of you on the ground Ohh! I hope you're not a sprinter.

How are you doing? Ah, there he is. The Moses of motivation. Ha! I'm stealing that, McClane. Great speech out there. I'd like to introduce you guys to someone. Allie, Nolan, this is Dr. Dani Santino. She's our in-house therapist. Nice to meet you, Dr. Santino. And you, Mr. Powers. My fiancée, Allie. So, therapist, huh? Let me hazard a guess. You're not a fan of my work. Oh, let's say that I'm aware of your work. Ah, the curse of indifference. You wound me. Oh, I'm just surprised that you're so anti-therapy when many of "Powers Pillars" have therapeutic roots. I'm not anti-therapy. I'm pro-active. I prefer not to dwell on the past. Oh, I don't dwell on it. I help people come to terms with it so they can move forward. What's the expression? "Talk is cheap"? Except therapy, where talk is expensive, takes years, goes in circles with no progress. Wow, you need a better therapist. I've never had one, actually. Let me refer to you one. All right. Stop. Ding, ding, ding. Everyone back to their own corners. I want everyone to get along here in the V3 sandbox. Allie, may I borrow your soon-to-be husband? We want to talk about some book details. Please. Okay. Come on. Pleasure to meet you. Sorry. Nolan can be opinionated. Most great minds are. You're kind. Mm. You are a beast! Oh, but I'm a lion tamer. Siegfried and Roy in this... Sheera? Sheera? Did I just get Jetered in my own home? Dr. Santino. Yes? Sam Conte from the L.A. office. I'm Cindy Luck's West Coast rep. Oh, pleasure. Is all mine. Cindy's doing great, so thank you. Well, I guess therapy works for some people. I'm a big fan of therapists, myself. Listen, I got a meeting to get to, but maybe our paths will cross again while I'm here. Maybe. Mr. Powers? Nolan? Yoo-hoo. Snap out of it. Can I help you with something? Does this window open? What? No. Why? 'Cause I want to kill myself. ♪ Baby, work your magic on me ♪ Necessary Roughness 3x04 ♪ Snap Out of It Original Air Date on July 10, 2013 == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man Nolan. Nolan, is everything all right? There you are. I've been looking all over. You finished with Connor? Hey, hon. I'm sorry. I got a migraine kicking in. I needed some quiet space. Aww. He gets those a lot. Can't do anything but nap out of it. Come on. Let's get some fuel in you. Care to join us for lunch? Uh, what? No. But thank you very much. Dr. Santino. You're pushing your luck. The government's luck is infinite. Cornered the market on rabbit feet. Our hacker is inside V3 secure network. Just let him do his thing. Troy Cutler is out of town on business for 24 hours. Now is the time. I need hard copies. Otherwise, it's not admissible. It's still risky. And my neck's on the chopping block. And you're neck deep -- wiretaps, bribery, and a host of other illegal activities you performed for your old pal Marshall Pittman. Which you're wiping clean, as part of our deal. Yes. But risk is part and parcel. You give a Fed an inch, he'll take a mile. But in this case, you're gonna meet me halfway. Meaning? I'll do this... But I want a favor in return. Call it a down payment. No, no, no. You -- you -- you have really outdone yourself. This episode 7 -- best one yet. Don't tell Lucas I said that. All right. No, may the force be with you, J.J. See you. Santino. Do for you, what can I? What's that? Yoda. Oh. I, uh -- okay. I got to ask you something. Nolan Powers -- how well do you know him exactly? I know him well. I mean, been a friend, client for 15 years. He's a little quirky, unpredictable. Don't play poker with him, 'cause he'll motivate your money right out of you. Why do you ask? He said something to me today that was...disconcerting. Did he hit on you? He told me that he wants to kill himself. Powers?! No. He must have been making a joke. It wasn't Seinfeld telling me. It seemed pretty serious. Yes, he's under pressure. He's got a book tour, a new TV show. But suicide? No. Never. I know what I saw, and I know what I heard. This isn't about this little therapy feud you guys have going, is it? I-I'm sorry. You think I'm making this up because Powers and I disagree? Wow. Okay. Excuse me. Come on, Santino. I didn't mean it like that. You want me to back off, that's totally fine, okay? He's your friend, not mine.

Of course, next week, we have "Letterman," the "Today" show, "Tonight Show." "Celebrity Apprentice" -- he's a judge during sweeps. I like that. And then, of course, the premiere of "Power up with Nolan Powers." The world is yours, my friend. Great job, everybody. Awesome job. Thank you so much. That's just awesome. Thank you so much. Awesome. Good job. Great job. Thank you. Good job. All right. Look at this answer man. You called it. You said it would happen and look at what we've built. Pillar number four -- believe it, and you can achieve it. That's right. Hey. How you feeling? You okay? Top of the world, mac. Why? Well, Dr. Santino showed a little concern over a conversation that you guys had together. Right. I had a migraine, so I ducked in an office for some quiet. I had no idea I was trespassing on her property. Okay. So, you didn't say that you wanted to kill yourself? You ever have a migraine? You'd want to kill yourself, too. I'm fine. Look, I'm not gonna deny there's some pressure with this book launch, this show. But I'm fine, Mac, I swear. Okay. Come on. Now, how about some Sushi? I'm buying. Okay. So, we're all twisty and turny. You know what I'm saying? Like, we're, like, basically -- Ah, ah, hey, hey! I don't need the visual. I want to hear about her. She's super hot. She's funny. Like me with a softer booty. Ha ha ha. So, what's the "but"? The "but" with one "T," not two. Oh, no buts. I'm getting it. I'm loving it. Huh! Doc, you ever had any that was so good that you just want to tell the world about it? I am so happy for you. May I make a diagnosis, good doctor? I think that you need to get some. Oh, Terrence! I do. I mean, it's written all over your face. Know what I'm saying? I could only say that from personal experience of looking in the mirror and seeing that depleted look, okay? So, what I'm saying is... Maybe there's somebody at the Hawks organization who's always had a crush on you. At the hawks? Mm-hmm. My boy Reggie! He's a good dude. I can hook y'all up. No. I mean, I'm sure he's a "good dude." But thank you. I'm set. You sure? Yeah. Well, okay. Suit yourself. But, you know, work hard, play hard. Got to make time for the... Oh, stop it! My bad. Yeah, I -- Okay. Well, you do you. You do you. You do you. Buh-bye. ♪ On the floor, on the floor ♪ ♪ On the floor, on the floor ♪ ♪ On the floor, on the floor ♪ So, Logan is a cute jerk. And Noah only wears tight pants. So you'll look at his bulge. Exactly. And then there's Troy. Who's an acquired taste. Yeah, if you like...Haggis. Troy is definitely Haggis. Here's to Haggis! Whoo! Is this women only or can anyone join? Oh, Sam, you came! Sit! How you guys doing? Hello, again. Hello. I thought this was G.N.O.? Yeah, well, part of G.N.O. Is about making contacts. At least let me buy you a drink. I have two. So you do. Hmm. Connor raves about you. Yeah? So how do I make an appointment on your couch? Why? What's wrong with you? I have been crushing really hard on this dazzling, electric woman. Really? So, then, what's the problem? The problem is I'm shy. So, I should be direct and tell her exactly what I want from her? You could. But then who's to say that she won't reject your wants and then report you to H.R.? She wouldn't do that. Mm. Would she? I don't know. What kind of person is she? Impressive, beautiful... Uh-huh. ...and sitting right next to me. Uh... Well, not so much with the shy. Mnh-mnh. Ah, saved by the vibration. This is Dani. What? I'm -- slow down. What? I didn't know who else to call. I didn't want to cause a panic. Allie, it's okay. Sit down. Everything you say to me is confidential. I couldn't ignore this. Nolan is very private. He can be secretive. At night, he stays up for hours. It's like he doesn't want to be near me. Oh. Couples' therapy is not an option. Anyway, um... tonight he went out. And he left his laptop open. And when I found... What he's been doing... I read his e-mails. I wish I didn't read them. What was in the e-mails? Three had webisodes from each department. Nolan Powers -- we have to talk. Santino, you got to get off this Powers fixation. I mean, yes, the guy's quirky, but genius usually is. Quirky? Mnh-mnh. Quirk does not make a grown man set up a fake e-mail account so that he can have improper late-night discussions with 12-year-old girls... Which is exactly what Powers is doing. I would never do that! Not in a million years. All right. But the fake account? These e-mails? I get thousands a day from all over the world. But I've never seen these. And why the hell would I create a fake e-mail account to talk to little girls about Spongebob Squarepants or -- I don't even know what "A.N.T. Farm" is! We are just trying to help. If you are struggling with anything or you need to talk... You know, I expect this from her. But you? After everything we've been through, this is how you treat me? Nolan, I'm on your side, but, come on, man. You got to admit this requires some sort of explanation. No, it does not! Because I didn't do this! Nolan, you know, Allie is very concerned about you. She and I are done. She's packing as we speak. And you're next if you keep this up. O-okay, look. Nolan, please. For your sake, help us get to the bottom of this. You know what? I'll take a lie-detector test right here today. That will prove indisputably I did not send those e-mails. You set it up. Hmm. Well, that's odd. Why did Troy install his own security system on top of V3's? Follow my lead. What? What are you doing? Installing new anti-malware just in case there's another SBG attack. No, no. I mean, what are you doing right now? Wait, time out. What? Yeah, I was a sporting-goods model for years until I got discovered and I became a high-fashion model. It's not like it was my dream to be a sex object. But I can't knock it. It put me through college. And where did you go? The university of hotness? Ha ha. No, Stanford. Wow. Boy, that's a -- that's a good school. Yeah, I was a double major in Art History and Business Admin. The plan is to be an entrepreneur and then a philanthropist. So, you want to be rich. Filthy rich, yeah. When I was younger, my family did the welfare thing for a couple of years, and I decided broke is not for me. So, independent woman. See, you are what we call multifaceted. And I am very happy that I am getting to know this side of you. Yeah? Yeah. So, hey. What about you? What's the other side of Terrence King? What's your long-term plan? Get the bling and the ring. Win a championship. Become a global icon. You know, the usual. And Connor's got some great stuff he's pitching me that's gonna make that happen. Okay, wait. I mean, you can't let them pitch you. You've got to pitch them. Modeling and football, they both have a really short shelf life. You got to maximize your window of opportunity. So, what is your vision? Okay. My vision... ...women's panties. Panties? Panties are your future? Well, it's weird when you put it that way, but, yes. I would start a lingerie line called Brickhouse Lingerie, for that woman who's built like a '70s funk song. You know what I'm saying? You heard of a G-string? I have. Yeah, well, I would make a T.K.-string. Yeah, and then I would do some flavored panties for the disenfranchised young ladies down here, and I would put some booty pads in it, 'cause you want that donky-donk in the trunky-trunk when you're messing with the Brickhouse. You know what I'm saying? I think that T.K. could be for lingerie what Joe Namath was for pantyhose. It's like a masculine take on the feminine. Okay, I love it. Y-you do? It's sexy and funny and masculine and feminine. You are hitting all the quadrants. You're damn right I'm hitting them quadrants! That's what I do! I hit quadrants! Okay, I have a crazy idea. What if you and I teamed up? We did Brickhouse together. Hear me out. With your swag and my fashion sense and my connections, we could blow this thing up like... A Kardashian doing nothing. Okay. Weird. Ooh! Peonies and lilacs. Paloma! Yes? Oh. Who gave me these? A secret admirer. Open the card. Oh. "Dinner before I leave town? Don't tell H.R." Sam. Oh, he's good. Well, he's persistent. I'll give him that. Who's persistent? Nobody. Nice flowers. I know. From somebody special? Hey! Yeah, from Mr. Nunya -- nunya business. You here for a reason or you just wanted some office gossip? Not the water-cooler type. Could we have a moment, privately? Oh. Thank you. So...what's up? Powers passed the polygraph test. I administered it with an expert and I thought that might put your mind at ease. Does Connor know? Yes. Can you pass a polygraph if you're lying? Extremely difficult. CIA trains guys to do it, but even then. Dr. Santino. Mm-hmm. Phone for you. Wouldn't give a name, but it sounded like Nolan Powers. Oh. Nolan? Is that you? What did he say exactly? That he was scared, that he wanted to talk, and to meet him at the hotel, and I'm telling you, if Nolan Powers is playing some elaborate mind game, then I want a witness this time. Geez. What, do you have an all-powerful key? Nolan? Nolan? Okay. He's not there. Mr. Powers! Nolan! Credit cards, driver's license -- it's odd to leave these behind. Everything about this is odd. What is a 40-year-old man doing alone watching cartoons, playing with stickers? Unless he's not alone. We have to find him now, Nico. So, to wrap it up, Brickhouse will be fusing the masculine with the feminine in a synergy of sexy. So, that's it. Yeah. What do you think? I think I love my job. Hey, T.K. come join the party. What kind of party is this, exactly? Sheera was just telling me about the idea you guys had. Brickhouse Lingerie. Pause. ♪ That dude ♪ I thought that we discussed pitching my idea to Connor when the time was appropriate? And I thought the appropriate time would be when I was actually here to pitch it? T.K., this is not what it looks like, so you need to let me explain. What kind of games are you playing? I am not playing any games. It looks like you're playing lingerie football. Okay, stop. Can we talk about this later? Because you are being unprofessional. I'm being unprofessional? Yeah. You need to look in the mirror, because the reflection has two sides. You know what? Never mind. Connor, Brickhouse Lingerie was my idea first. Yes. So she has no right to pitch this to you without my consent. All right, there seems to be some sort of communication glitch here, and I suggest you both figure out, because we're one big, happy family. No, no, no, no, no. She and I are not on the same family here, okay? And as my first order of business as the C.E.O. of Brickhouse, Sheera, you're fired. No, no. Take your bricks up out of my house. T.K, come -- T.K.! We went through the surveillance tapes. Powers was the only one who went in and out of the room, and he arrived at and left the hotel by himself -- no kids. So what are we missing? Imitrex. Mm-hmm. It's used for migraines. Oh, yeah. He's had those for years. And he blacks out sometimes. What do you mean, "blacks out"? I don't know. He just blacks out. I mean, that's why he doesn't drink. He doesn't want to lose control. All right, so, Allie said he cut off contact. We have his cellphone, and he's not at the hotel. Yeah, and Nico checked the hospitals, the morgue. How does this happen? How does a recognizable guy like Powers just disappear into thin air? And this stuff -- this doesn't look good. I mean, drawings, crayons, kid scissors. Yeah, they're lefty scissors. What do you mean, lefty scissors? Lefty. Good news and bad news. We think we found him. W-where? The Trenton police are holding him for attempted arson of his childhood home. He had no I.D. on him. He was disoriented. A cop buddy who owes me a favor is keeping a lid on it until we get out there. - Jasmine? Jasmine. - Yeah? Call Ben and have him fire up the helicopter. We're going to Trenton. You got it. Why does a guy like Nolan Powers try to burn his house down? Or why -- why does he do any of this? Unless it's not Nolan Powers. I owe you. All smoothed out. No charges will be filed. He's in the holding area. All right, well, before they release him and he runs off again, I would really like to speak with him. Yeah, so would I. Well, would you mind if I talked to him first, alone? Jeff. I didn't set some house on fire. Okay, but it wasn't just some house. It's where you grew up, right? So what?! I wasn't trying to burn it down! What were you doing there, Nolan? I don't know. Nolan, who wrote this? Not me! Someone's trying to destroy me! Don't you get it?! Who? Who is trying to destroy you? Help me understand that. Oh, God. Are you having another migraine? I'm not gonna talk to anyone until I see my lawyer. Okay. Okay. I understand. You don't want to talk to me. I'm just wondering... If someone else does. Someone else? What the hell are you talking about? What are you drawing? Castle. It keeps people safe. I want to tell you something about what's been going on, but he won't listen. Well, I'll listen. What's your name? Scotty. How old are you, Scotty? 8 3/4. It's all good. We should get him out of here before anybody sniffs this out. Okay. You okay? What happened in there? Um... I don't even know where to begin. Multiple personalities? It's also called Dissociative Identity Disorder. It's when two distinct identities are fighting to control one person. And often, memory loss accompanies it. So, you're saying these blackouts are 'cause this alter ego, Scotty, has taken control of my mind? Somewhere in your childhood, you suffered abuse that was so traumatizing -- severe enough that it forced you to split, to disassociate. You are the host personality that has created this entire empire. And then Scotty, the alter personality, is this scared 8-year-old, little boy. The one who sent those e-mails. The one who wants help. But how can I possibly have built what I've built if I really have this alter ego? Many people with D.I.D. are exceptionally high functioning. We're talking about Heisman trophy winners, C.E.O.s, famous musicians and actors. And, frankly, their ability to compartmentalize is a big part of their success. So...What now? Well, I would like to refer you to a specialist who deals with this condition, 'cause it's out of my area of expertise. But I do know one thing, and that is if you want to integrate Scotty and Nolan, then therapy is imperative. And, uh... And what if I don't go? Scotty will keep trying to burn the house down until he is heard. And you will have many more episodes like these. How the hell did you figure all this out? It was the sudden shift in personalities and the migraines, the blackouts that you mentioned. It's how he transitioned between personas. So he was either a pathological liar or he really didn't remember doing those things. So, that's how he passed the lie-detector test? Yes. I also picked up that he switched from being a righty to a lefty, which is another sign of switching personas. I think that he resisted going to therapy all these years in an effort to hide it. Mm-hmm. Right? 'Cause Scotty wanted help. But then Powers wanted to hide the truth, so then he just taught himself to snap out of it. Thinking about this thing is giving me a migraine. I know. He didn't want to talk about it. That's why he wanted me to explain it to you. But he did want you to know that he will be at the book signing. Hey, Santino. I'm sorry that I didn't, uh, trust you. It's a new relationship. Trust is earned. All right. Here. Enjoy. Hey, Connor, I just wanted to say I was sorry about -- Save it. No need for sorry. I'm in. That's -- that's great. Uh, but, uh, you're in for what exactly? Brickhouse. Hi. I've had some time to think about this. This is -- this is good. This is dynamic. I mean, the merging of your two different personas is like Yin and Yang. Like we're two sides of the same coin. A sexy coin, though, so you two need to kiss and make up. Yes. I mean, think about it. The two of you together, pimping this thing out? And Brickhouse could do for lingerie what P. Diddy did for men's wear. You think so? I know so. We just have to come up with a brand name like he did -- like Sean John, so let's think about it. We got, uh -- oh, T.K, Sheera. Tkeera. She-K. I love it. Why does she get top billing? This is good. We'll put a design team together. "Brickhouse by She-K." I like this. I hope you two like working together, because this is -- this is good. Powers -- on the phone. All right. You two -- da-da. Honey, I'm home. What's for dinner? I Uh, sleep with a side of sleep. I'm heading out. I see you go the flowers. Oh, my God. Yes. Thank you. I'm so sorry. They're beautiful. Tough day? Tough week. I got just the cure. I'm staying at the Empire Grand Hotel. The bartender there makes a martini you could prescribe to kill depression. Join me for some treatment? Oh, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. Fair enough. But if you change your mind, I'll be there. Tonight, tomorrow night -- lady's choice. Could be you just need a little of my personal therapy. Oh. Oh, well, back to that empty calendar. Oh, hi, pimpy. Assist-y. I'm just wondering what's stopping you, an unattached, awesome woman, from having drinks with an unattached, handsome, lovely man? Everything you asked for. Says he found a second set of books V3 keeps. All its financial transactions. Oh, this is Disneyland-worthy. Our analysts will have a field day. Outstanding, Mr. Careles. Now, about that down payment. What did you have in mind? I.C.E. This is I.C.E. How can I help you? What's your business here? Visitation. I.D.? You must have some friends in high places. Name of the inmate? Careles. Alex Careles. To your left. Thanks. What's your name? Mark. Mark? Nice to meet you, Mark. Thank you so much for coming. Hey. Hey. I spoke to Powers. And...? And he's blowing off the psychiatrist you wanted him to see. Connor, you can't let him do that. He needs help. He's a ticking time bomb, and when he goes boom -- He'll write another book all about it, he'll make another $100 million, and I'll do what I always do. I'll keep an eye on him. Santino, don't take this so hard. You did your best. This is for you, miss. My God. Wow. Yeah. You just needed a little laughter in your life. Mm-hmm. I'm glad you changed your mind. Me too. Can't forget that every now and then you need to...decompress. And you were right. These martinis are awesome. My best friend fell in love over one of these. Oh? I can see how. Last call. Could you just put it on the room? Of course. Thank you. Ohh. Looks like the party's coming to an end. Hmm... Maybe it doesn't have to. Oh. Well, I don't know if I've had that many martinis. Maybe I'm not that kind of girl. Well, maybe Dr. Santino from the office isn't. But the Dani sitting right here -- she might be a different story.
