Mean it. Mean it. Non-fat cappuccino, no foam? Yes, please. Thank you. Ta-da! Oh! [ Laughs ] What do you think? Wow. 'Cause I think we need a bigger bottle of cologne. You know what I'm saying? Congratulations. I think that's fantastic, Terrence.

 Yeah, it's pretty sexy. But it's -- you know, it's not a Nike ad. Ah-ah! Do not play the compare game. That is deadly. Yeah, I know. Patience, T.K. I'm trying. Well, the secret to patience is finding something else to do in the meantime. Maybe it's not something. Maybe it is someone. [ Scoffs ] Oh, no -- it's my one-year anniversary of sobriety. You know, that means the King is free to shwing again. You mean to date? No, I mean to shwing, with a capital "Shw." There you are. Speaking of which. Hello, little miss corporate sunshine.

And Hutch called, nervous about that ESPN interview, wants to squeeze in some extra time on Thursday. And Friday night is MV3. MV3? It's a monthly cocktail party. Connor gives a bonus check to the MVP of V3 for the month. How does one become an "MVP"? Catch him a whale. You know, a-a huge client. Oh, well, I'm glad that doesn't apply to me. [ Chuckles ] Hey, Santino. You got plans this eve? She's all clear. Good. We're celebrating. You like Sushi, beer, sweaty men in shorts? ♪ Step off to the side 'cause I'm coming like a bullet ♪ Announcer: Ball is to the left side to Langer. Langer has Burke open. Looks him off. He hits Jones for the 3. And he banks in the "J." [ Whistle blows ] And just like that, the Blizzard are up by 1. [ Cheers and applause ] Sushi? No, thanks. You ever been to a Blizzard game? Well, yeah, in the nosebleed seats. I never sat court-side before. Well, these used to be Trump's seats before the recession. Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Traveling! [ Whistle blows ] Hey! Traveling! Oh. So... What are we celebrating? Good start. Hutch is drafted. Cindy's movie's in the can. I'd say you're doing pretty well, right? Really? That's why you brought me here? Yeah. [ Whistle blows ] Okay. Watch this. Langer's at the free-throw line. And we now have a foul on the play, and Langer's gonna step to the free-throw line. [ Whistle blows ] And I can guarantee you he is not looking forward to this. This has been the stuff nightmares are made of.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine. Devon. Oh, C-Mac. How you doing, brother? How you living, man? Nice to see you. Listen, I, uh -- I'm sorry about what happened out there. [ Sighs ] Yeah, the city's gonna build new projects with all the brick's I'm laying. Well, maybe there's something I could do to help you. I'd like you to meet Dr. Dani Santino. She's our newest superstar at V3. You're the one who got Terrence King sober. That's right. And Rex Evans gave you a shout-out on ESPN. That would be me. You think you can help me? Well, I can certainly try. And I can certainly hook you two up. You the man, C-Mac. [ Chuckles ] Thanks. Oh, and thank you -- hopefully. Mm-hmm. [ Chuckles ] Connor McClane! Oh, hey. This is Dr. Santino. Howard Kershaw, say hi to -- Stay the hell away from my client, asshole! Oh! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yo, Devon, wait up! [ Chuckles ] Langer's not your client? Well, not yet. ♪ Baby, work your magic on me ♪ Necessary Roughness 3x03 ♪ Swimming With Sharks Original Air Date on June 26, 2013 == sync, corrected by elderman == [][ Indistinct conversations ] [ Sighs ] Langer just called about our appointment that apparently you scheduled. Santino, how do I look in pinstripes? You think, uh, too gangster? I think... That I am not bait or krill or chum. You may not dangle me like some sort of company perk. Elena, thank you so much. And tell Giorgio the man's an artist. Give him a kiss for me, please. On the cheek. Santino, let me ask you something. Why does a peacock show its feathers? I -- what? I don't know. Um... To attract a mate. Yes -- and you are a feather. You're a beautiful V3 feather. And why wouldn't I wave you around like any other asset? A-a-and my interests aside, this kid Langer -- he's falling apart. I just thought you could help him before it gets worse. But I can cancel. I mean, that's not a problem. Jasmine! Jasmine: Yes? Get me Devon Langer on the phone, please. Okay. Oh, hold up -- buh-buh-buh! Okay, just wait a second. Now you're putting it on me like I'm gonna abandon someone in need. Santino, if I've learned anything from you, it's mental health comes first. What about my exclusivity contract? Waived, temporarily. Is there any situation that you can't spin? I'm thinking...No. [ Chuckles ] All right, okay -- as long as we're clear that I am not going to try and turn this guy into a V3 client. I don't want you to turn him into anything but a free-throwing machine, really. All right. Okay. Mm. Mm. Uh-huh. Pain au chocolat? Troy. Doctor. [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] We have a problem. The phones are down at the entire agency? Yes. How does that happen? Someone can't just snip a few wires. Don't we have firewalls or whatever? We do. The Internet's down, too. Great -- so I'll just, uh, I'll go down to the local 7-Eleven. I'll use the crack phone to call Peyton or -- or Eli. How close are we to having this fixed? He's working on it. Well, whatever it is, until we're back up, it means this agency is exposed. If we can't contact our clients, it means someone else can. This is not just some technical difficulty. I want every agent here at V3 to get ahold of every client on their roster. Use a cellphone, shoe phone, smoke signal. I don't care. Just get ahold of them and lock them down! Where are we? I'm being hack-a-shacked. Hack-a-shacked? It's when the other team intentionally fouls a player that they know sucks at free throws because they know he's gonna miss. Named for Shaquille O'Neal. Now they're calling it "bang-a-langing," 'cause the sucky free-thrower would be me. Okay, well -- sucky players don't average 27 points per game or get honors like MVP or rookie of the year. [ Chuckles ] Now you sound like my mom. [ Chuckles ] She's like the team mascot. Never misses a game. So you two are close? Yeah -- only kid, single mom. Not an easy thing when you're growing up in Detroit. All we had was each other. Yeah, either you slang crack rock or you had a wicked jump shot. [ Chuckling ] And my jumper is lethal. Mm-hmm. So, you said that your free-throw percentage went from 80% to 40% in the last two months. What's changed in your life? I don't know. Just stuck in a vicious cycle. If they foul me, I miss the shot. I miss the shot, I lose my temper -- end up with a bunch of T's. Uh, T's? Fouls for unsportsmanlike conduct. You do enough of those, and they suspend your ass. [ Sighs ] Look, my mom sacrificed everything to get us here. If I'm not careful, it could all go up in smoke. And I've seen it happen. And I don't want to go back to where I came from. Okay. Congratulations to me. One year of sobriety. Which means, I am free to skinny dip in the dating pool. Which means your ass is coming to the club tonight. You want me there for what, exactly? You're Goose. I'm Maverick. Uh-huh. The perfect wingman, bro. Fly different planes, and we damn sure land on different strips. [ Laughs ] So you think it's gonna be that easy. Just 'cause you're Terrence King, you can stroll into some random club and pick up the hot chick. Excuse me. Rex Evans? Mm-hmm. And Terrence king. Right? Yes, I am. This is an amazing ad. Yes, it is. Makes me want to buy what you're selling. Yes, it does -- but for you, it's only free-99. [ Chuckles ] I never do this, but would it be weird if I gave you my number? I think it would be weird if you didn't give me your number, looking like yourself. Thank you, Abby. No, thank you. Wow! Feel the need -- the need for speed. Goose me, Goose. You're ridiculous. [ Crowd cheering ] [ Heart beating ] [ Laughs ] Yeah, it's a piece of cake here. There's no crowd, no reporters, no pressure. Well, what's going through your head when you're at the line? Well, when I'm shooting good, nothing. When I'm not, everything. Tomorrow's headlines, haters on Twitter, disappointed fans. That sounds like analysis paralysis. It's overthinking. So we got to get you out of your head and back to that muscle memory. How are we gonna do that? Well, when you were at Michigan State, you used to do this turnaround jump shot right from the free-throw line, right? Yeah, that was my money spot, my all-day ATM. You did your research. Yes, I did. Now you show me that move. ♪ Banging drums and loud guitars ♪ ♪ and rocket ships and shooting stars ♪ [ Chuckles ] Again. ♪ Oh, no Again. ♪ Now I've got to know, now, are you with me? ♪ ♪ Shout it out, bring it all ♪ ♪ If you want to sing it loud ♪ Everyone, let me hear you say ♪ ♪ "Oh, yeah," come on ♪ Whoo! That is some good muscle memory. Yeah, but I got no problem with my jumper. How is this gonna help? Well, when you were making the move, there was no time for analysis. There was no time for paralysis. You should be a rapper. "Analysis, paralysis, got you on dialysis." [ Chuckles ] So what? So the next time that you are up for a free throw, you're gonna do the turnaround jump shot, and you're gonna make the basket. Yeah, I can't do that in a game. Why not? 'Cause it's embarrassing. More embarrassing than missing a shot, or being ejected from the game? [ Door opens ] Lana: Anybody home? Hey, baby. [ Laughs ] Oh! How you doing? Good. Are we gonna have a good game tonight? Great game. Ah! Awesome game! Oh! [ Laughs ] [ Chuckles ] Lana, this is Dr. Santino. Oh, pleasure to meet you. And you two know each other how? This is the lady that I was telling you about, the one who's been helping me. Oh, right. And you two know each other how? Well, this is Lana Langer -- my mother. [ Chuckles ] Oh. I hate when he calls me that. Makes me sound so old. I got you a seat next to her tonight. Oh! [ Laughs ] Yeah! We're gonna have a good time! Ah, it's gonna be fun! Ooh-ooh! [ Laughs ] Ooh! [ Elevator bell dings ] Oh! Oh! What, do I have LoJack on my shoes? How did you do that? Assistants are alerted when you swipe your security card. Uh, I have been trying to call the office. Phones were down. Internet, too. Did they forget to pay their bill? Eh, a little more mysterious than that. Big bosses are behind closed doors. Phones are just down temporarily. We're switching out the system. Yeah -- Peyton, look. You have my cellphone -- call me anytime. Listen, bring Ash and the kids over for another barbecue. Hey, man, come on! I perfected the ribs by now. Yes. Say hi to your brother. Good. [ Beep ] Tell me the problem's fixed or don't tell me anything at all! Everything's back up. But... "But"? I don't like that word "but." Nothing good follows. Security program found a malicious code when we restarted the system. How malicious? We've been hacked. Oh, Jesus. By who? Jasmine: Connor, this package just came, marked "urgent." I got it. For you. No return address. [ Clears throat ] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What if that's a bomb? It's too late. Yeah, don't be so paranoid. Wait, wait, wait -- what if it's Anthrax? Then we'll be dead in a week. Yeah, all right. What is that? Dirty laundry. So, for the MV3 party, a few things you should know. Yeah, well, Friday night I have plans that you don't know about maybe. [ Chuckles ] In case they fall through, thought I'd give you the 411 before you're thrown into the deep end, so to speak. Deep end of what? The dating pool... Can be dangerous if you haven't swam for a while. So, Bill in media is a shark -- an amazing agent, but a definite player. Watch out for him. Trevor in marketing, more of a barracuda -- a little slippery, but a good kisser. Not that I would know. Right. Paloma, uh, I appreciate the 411, but I don't want to hear about the sharks and the jets and whatnot, because I ain't going swimming. Connor: All right, listen up, everybody. First shots were fired this morning. From this point forward, we're officially at war. The enemy -- SBG Management. SBG -- why do I know that name? Because they represent Devon Langer. []The phones, the Internet. It's all retaliation for trying to poach Langer? Maybe. Maybe? You took the first shot. What did you think Bruce was gonna do? Bruce? Who's Bruce? The "B" in SBG. And Connor's former assistant. Whose parting words to me were, "I'm tired of doing your dirty laundry, jackass." Oh. Look. Poaching is part of the business, right? I mean, agencies are always in a state of Cold War or hot war. Hot, cold, lukewarm -- I do not want to be the cause of any war. And I don't want Langer to become a casualty. Of course not. Look, Dani. I'm a lover, not a fighter. So, Nico, whether it was Bruce or someone else who hacked us, I'd like you to find them and squash them. What does this security program do? It puts a firewall between your files and V3's mainframe. Oh, good. But I don't really keep much on here, not after what happened with Pittman. That won't happen again. I promise. Oh, I-I'm sorry. I should have knocked. All set. Thank you. Mr. Careles. Paloma. See you at MV3? Never miss it. Cephalopod. Huh? Mr. Careles. He's like an octopus or a squid. Their bodies can switch from transparent to opaque in the blink of an eye. He's opaque to most but transparent when he looks at you. I'm just calling it like I see it. Okay, Paloma, the only thing you should be calling is my clients to confirm appointments. Capisce? Capisce. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Chuckles ] No, seriously, I can't believe that Machismo is your first major endorsement. Well, it's not the first major. I mean, you know, there was Sport-E Boost -- the sports drink. [ Laughing ] But, uh, we don't talk about that. [ Chuckles ] You know what? Those sports drinks are just pure sugar anyway. I don't like to put things like that into my body. So what kind of things do you like to put in your body? [ Chuckles ] Natural things. Well [clears throat] that's good, 'cause I don't know if you was aware, but all this right here -- this is 100% all natural. [ Chuckles ] Terrence King, you are funny. And you are beautiful. So, tell me what you do for a living. 'Cause when I met you, you were all, you know, business-y and lawyer-y and... Well, I do have a law degree, but I run my own business now. What? Mm-hmm. That's impressive. Look at you, miss head honcho boss lady, all beautiful, running your own company. [ Keyboard clacking ] So it's a trap. Called a reverse trojan horse. Well, if they're fishing for information, it makes sense for us to set bait. We create a false file, one that looks like it contains some company secrets, but it'll also contain some hidden code. Once the file's downloaded, it allows the hackers to be hacked. Hmm. That's pretty clever. I assume that's why you hired me. Right. Well, I'll leave you to it. Announcer: Jones brings the ball up court. And here come the Blizzard. They're struggling to find a rhythm here tonight. [ Crowd cheering ] Langer passes it to Spears. Spears back to Langer, who's open for the lay-up on the left side, and he gets hammered. [ Whistle blows ] Ah! There they go bang-a-langing! Come on! [ Indistinct conversations ] Man: Right? Man #2: You know what I'm saying? And the adventure continues as Langer makes his way to the line. ♪ Coming strong now, baby ♪ Chugging for you now ♪ Tell me, tell me Yeah! Did you teach him that? That's the way to do it, Devon! Whoo! Announcer: Oh, I've seen it, and I don't believe it. Devon Langer just shot a turnaround jumper from the line, and it went in. That is an absolute first for me. [ Whistle blows ] ♪ Play guitar, half the time gonna ♪ ♪ Out all night, running around ♪ [ Crowd cheers ] Whoo! That's the way to do it, Devon! Whoo! [ Laughs ] Looks like you're doing a great job with my son. Did he tell you that I'm his biggest fan? Yes, he did. You got to be very proud of him. I always tell him, "I don't call you 'son' because you shine. I call you 'son' because you mine." ♪ Tell me ♪ Why you got to be so Hey! Come on! Come on, Devon! What are you doing?! Kyle's open! Rotate the ball! Rotate the ball! Hey! [ Whistle blows ] What are you doing holding onto the ball? Ball rotation's the name of the game. Swing it. Mom, sit down. No. Sit down, ma'am. Excuse me. I'm trying to talk to my boy. Take it easy. No, you take it easy. Off the court now. No! Hey. Back up off my mom, dawg. [ Whistle blows ] You're out of here. You too. Get your hands off me. There she is. Chocolate soufflé. Get it while it's hot. See, that could have been a commercial right there. [ Chuckles ] Think so? Seriously, T.K., why aren't you doing Pepsi or Coke or Nike? I ask myself that all the time. I mean, you know, no offense to Machismo. I just...I think you're better than that. [ Chuckles ] Tell that to my manager. Well, I wouldn't have to if it was me. W-what? I'm Abigail Bruce, managing partner at SBG. Most people call me "Bruce." []This whole thing. was a setup? Wait, you -- you -- you tried to poach me? Which makes me the egg. You know what? I -- thank you for dinner. And enjoy picking up the tab. T.K., look -- wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I wasn't totally up front with you, but I know that you're loyal, which I respect. So I thought I needed to take a backdoor approach. Backdoor -- this is a backstab approach. You know, it's been real. Actually, it's been fake. So Bruce Abby or Bruce Springsteen, whatever the hell your name is, you have a good night. Connor give you the ring-and-the-bling speech? He tell you you have to be patient, you got to take it slow? Well, the cold, hard truth is athletes have a relatively small window of time to land endorsements, and Terrence King deserves Nike, not some has-been cologne. Oh, so you're gonna show me the money. I'm saying Connor is slow-playing you because he has 100 clients ahead of you on his call sheet. SBG is a boutique agency by choice. We keep our roster small so we can give our clients the attention they need, they deserve. And with me, you'll get the same loyalty you give. So what you're saying is, Connor's not loyal? There are things I know about him, things I think you should know. Dani: I thought it would be helpful to have you both here so we could discuss what happened at the game. I got the ball on the wing, and then they doubled me. Couldn't find anyone open, so I split the double team. And no one was open? Kyle was all by himself right under the basket. Okay, wait. Who's Kyle? Burke. Kyle Burke. The guy who was supposedly wide open but wasn't. Geez. You're always doing this. Doing what? Criticizing my game in front of a stadium full of people. Look, if you have a comment, why don't you save it for when we're at home instead of 20,000 fans? Well, I am not 20,000 fans! I am your mother! And if you need help with your game, I'm gonna tell you. Mom, come on! I don't need you helping me with my game! I know how to play. Boy -- Okay, time-out. Time out! Hey. This might be a good time to discuss setting some boundaries. For example, Lana... Mm. ...when it comes to Devon's game, maybe it would be better to let the coaches do the coaching. Excuse me? Who are you? Who are you to be telling me how to talk to Devon?! I'm his mother! Y-yeah, don't blame Lana for any of this! If it wasn't for her sacrifices, I wouldn't even be here. Okay, I'm not blaming anybody for anything. Ever since I was 16, this boy has been my life. I know, mom. And I'm sorry. [ Sobs ] I came to you for help with my game. And now you're trying to mess with the most important relationship of my life? Come on, Lana. We're done. Wait, Devon. Devon! [ Door opens ] You see how upset you've made him? [ Door slams ] What the hell? I don't enjoy being followed. I-I'm not -- Sure you are. Do me a favor. You tell Troy I had a veggie burrito for lunch, I'm scheduled for a haircut on Tuesday. Anything else, I'll tell him when I'm ready. [ Whistle blows ] You're out of here. You too. [ Sighs ] Lindsay: [ Laughs ] Oh, my God. I know. He is so freaking hot. Hi, honey. Well, if he didn't like you, then why would he text you 25 times? What's this? Hang on a second. It's Kelley Blue Book. I figured out my new car and exactly how much it's gonna cost us. I did the research, and it's in our price range. Right, but looking together was gonna be half the fun. Yeah, and about twice the amount of time. Young woman: Lindz, are you there? Yeah, but he totally ignored me last night. Yeah, I know. Guys are such idiots. I guess it's nature's way of making women stronger. Hey, are we still on for Friday? [ Inhales sharply ] Yeah, right? Announcer: I don't believe it. Devon Langer just shot a turnaround jumper from the line, and it went in. That's an -- He was mad at him before the foul. T.K.! What's up? How's the King? Had a pretty interesting dinner last night. Oh, yeah? Yeah, thought I was gonna be knocking some boots, then I got knocked into a sales pitch about leaving V3 for SBG. Bruce. Let me guess. She tell you I was slow-playing you 'cause I have 50 other clients to service? 100, but, yeah. Tea? No. It's a special blend they make for me in Thailand. This is a business where people say a lot of things, but it's what they do that matters. Well, yeah. She says I should be doing Nike, not some sort of tiger-juice musk. Right, easy for her to say that she can get you big endorsements after I've done all the groundwork, right? Look, if you want someone who blows smoke -- and trust me, she can do it well -- then I say go with her. And how do I know you're not blowing smoke right now? You don't. This is not funny, dude. This is my future. I-I have a limited amount of time. I-I have a window. Mm-hmm. And if I'm not guided by the right hands, I could end up with nothing after football. Oh, and you think Bruce has the right hands? I've seen 'em. I know what she does. S-she'll pet you real nice. But let me tell you something. She's not gonna be happy until she's got you by the... Okay, so, let's say I do leave. You're not gonna page-six me and ruin my rep, are you? Look, V3 has a 98% retention rate. That's a fact. It's not like I'm breaking bones to make people stay here. Look, T.K., if you want to go with Bruce, I say go. Go with God. But there is one thing you should know about me. I take this very personally. And it breaks my heart when someone goes. I mean, years ago, I made a pact with myself. Once you walk out on me... ...you don't get to come back. Jasmine: Connor? Mr. Careles -- in the conference room. Carpe diem. Oh. Hey, Devon. Can we talk? I don't think we have anything else to talk about, Doc. Um... [ Sighs ] Listen. The free throws, your mom, and the anger, it's all connected. And what does that mean? Anger is a response to being hurt. See, this is why I don't want to talk. Yeah, maybe my mom is too involved in my game, but -- But it's more than that, isn't it? Every time that you make a free throw, you are staring at your mom, and it is killing your percentages. So the question is, what are you so angry about? When you look at your mom -- Look! What the hell are you getting at, lady?! Huh?! I reviewed the game tapes, and I noticed that there is a lot of tension between you and Burke. There's nothing to tell. The amount of times that you pass him the ball in a game has dropped 50%. So...what happened? Devon, I know -- I know this is hard. But if you are going to really stop the chaos in your head, then you have got to be honest. All right, look. You want honesty? Yes! Fine! Here it is. Kyle Burke is banging my mom. []Kevin I know your upset. You have no idea what I'm feeling, all right? My mom's sleeping with a teammate half her age. Does your mom know how you feel about this? She doesn't know that I know. All right? And she can't. Why? Because she can't. Okay? If she wants to be with Burke, then that's the way it is. If she wants to yell at me in the middle of a game, I have to look the other way. But you can't look the other way. Because when you were out there trying to make a free throw, trying to clear your head, you got Burke on the court, you got your mother on the sidelines. You were afraid of something in -- in the therapy session with your mom, weren't you? What were you afraid of? I can't chance it. You -- you can't chance what? Devon, you are still not being honest with me. About seven years ago... when I went off to college... ...my mom got depressed. Empty-nest syndrome or whatever. Totally normal. But it's not normal to take a bottle of pills. No. No, it's not. The paramedics got there just in time. She almost didn't make it. She is all I've got, Dr. Santino, a-and I'm all that she's got. Devon... the vicious cycle that you have to break is not with the ball o-or with being fouled. It's with your mother. At a certain point, a mother has to let her child grow up and move on. But Lana never learned to do that. And the result of that is this form of co-dependency where you feel responsible for her happiness. And the result of that is extreme unhappiness for you. So what am I supposed to do? You have to put it all out on the table. And it will be a long process. But we will work through it together. She's not gonna like it. No. Will you be there when I ask her? Absolutely. She don't play. No, she don't. [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] Yeah. Sit down. Hands in lap. Troy, Connor... Stanzi Palmer. Say hello to the nice men. Hello. Now tell them who you work for. SBG. This is your hacker. I picked him up in an Internet café. He was about an hour away from worming his way into our e-mail server. Do I need a lawyer? Wait outside. I'll let you know. In that chair. What do we do with him? Press charges. Nail his ass to the wall. Or... Or what? Let him walk? If this goes public that anyone hacked into V3, much less someone from SBG, it could scare clients, make us look weak. We can't just let them get away with corporate espionage. You keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Poach the hacker. Brilliant. Hire the guy? Yeah. Why not? You can't beat 'em, join 'em. Or make them join you. Seems to be the order of the day. Next time, don't have me followed. Just ask. [ Knock on glass ] Dr. Santino, do you have a minute? Mm-hmm. I-I just wanted to say I'm sorry if I overstepped. Paloma, that's not necessary. I have a tendency to blur the boundaries. That's what my therapist says. Okay. Well, this therapist says don't apologize. This is a new relationship. We are different. We just need to learn to navigate the waters between us. Capisce. Okay. Hey. Hear you're running a two-for-one special. Hmm? I spoke with Langer. Says you're helping him and his mother now. He call you, or you call him? Hey, I just said you didn't have to push anymore. It doesn't mean I can't keep trying. Regardless, you know, he's -- he's never gonna leave his agent. I mean, he's been with Howard since the beginning. I'm sorry, Captain Ahab. I know you wanted that whale. [ Cheers and applause ] Sounds like someone got one. Is that Devon Langer? I thought he wasn't leaving his agent. He's not. Why take the rose when you can have the whole bush? You poached Langer's agent? Wow. You play rough. Santino, this is what it means to swim in this ocean. You're either predator or prey. The thing about Bruce... ...she broke my heart. I trusted her. I mentored her. And how did she repay me? When I was sitting in the hospital, waiting for my father to die, she snuck into my office, stole my files, took some of my clients, a few of my best agents, and started her own place. The thing about V3 is we're a family. And I am fiercely loyal to my clients and my employees. And I expect the same from them. I need the same. All right. Time to welcome the new kids. ♪ Ain't nobody gonna riff on me ♪ ♪ When I'm gone ♪ Riff on me Devon! Welcome. Thanks, Connor. Glad to be here. Hey, man. Good to see you. Is that you? No. It should be. Yeah, you're right. You've got a much nicer ass. [ Chuckles ] Fresh. Wait. You're not from SBG, are you? Uh, how did you know that? See? You like a C.E.O., C.F.O., what? [ Chuckles ] No. No, I'm a -- I'm a client. Was a client. I'm with these guys now. Oh. Just signed with their fashion department today, actually. Oh, I'm a model. Oh, people pay you to look like this? Yes, that's the definition of a model. [ Both chuckle ] That's a good one. Uh, wait. So you left SBG for V3? They were slow-playing me. Hey, tell me this. Are you happy here? I'm happier now. Terrence. Sheera. Yes, you are. Bennett: Well, I have to admit, when you suggested we hack into their system, I didn't think we'd pull it off. We needed to see all his books. Agency war seemed the perfect cover. You played it perfectly. So did he. Nice work, Stanzi. Thanks. Well, congratulations, gentlemen. Instead of having one man on the inside, now we have two. []Lindz, I'm home! And I brought pumpkin ravioli from Maria's, and meatballs! Oh, I'm so sorry, but Sarina's having a sleepover. And I know we talked about dinner, but... Uh, okay. You know what? I can cancel. No. No. It's Friday night. You go out. You have fun. It's not your job to worry about me. Come here. Well, Sunday night, dinner. Is that a question? No. It's a date. Done. [ Chuckles ] [ Door opens, closes ] [ Cellphone rings ] Ooh! Ray Jay, hi! No, no! No, I-I'm just happy to hear your voice, honey. ♪ Now, shake it just like you got it ♪ [ Indistinct conversations ] ♪ Are you ready? ♪ Are you ready? ♪ Just keep that same old beat, y'all ♪ ♪ Ow! So, you came. Oh. [ Chuckles ] Well, you know, I figured, uh, if I'm going to work here, then I better act like part of the family. Like you. You look beautiful. Santino, Careles, glad you could make it. Never miss it. Oh, look. I got to fill up. [ Sighs ] We all need to just exhale and have a drink. It's been a tough week. Great party. You got it, Howard. Well, it could have been a tougher week. You caught a whale. Well, I already got myself a whale a few weeks ago. Right. T.K. No. You, Santino. Speaking of... Um, too much cabbage. Can't accept it. Yes, yes. Yes, you can. You are my MVP. This is all you've done for V3 and all you're going to do for V3. [ Chuckles ] God! Do you ever not get what you want? Yeah, when I was a kid, I wanted a dinosaur, then I found out they were extinct. [ Both chuckle ] Hey, I got a proposition for you. Come to Idaho with us. Yes! It's the Allen and Company conference. I got to make some goofy speech. Wheels up in four hours. No, I can't just "wheels-up." Am I even asking? Don't I always get what I want? Paloma, can you call Florio, tell him to make sure there's room for one more on the jet tonight? Of course. Thanks. Mm. Look, I'll have you back by Sunday. I promise, Santino. You are gonna have fun. Come on. Come on. What is happening? No! Oh! "What's happening?" Music! [ Chuckles ] ♪ Lord, have mercy Man: Whoo! == sync, corrected by elderman == ♪ Lord, have mercy ♪ Look at me, I can't stand up straight ♪ ♪ Look there
