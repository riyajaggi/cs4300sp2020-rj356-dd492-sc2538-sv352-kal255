 Work it, girl. That dress is definitely you. Now you know what to buy me for my birthday and the next five after that. You're back out in 90 seconds. Hustle. Relax. It's couture, not cancer.

 BOSLEY". Keep an eye on him. Why do all creeps have to be world-class sprinters? Bos, Kate, we are in pursuit. Who are you guys? Cops? We're private detectives. Where's Gabriella Tucker? I don't know. Look, I'm just a photographer. You were stalking her. Now she's missing. Come on, Jerry. Did you kidnap her? No. Gun! I got him! Well...

 That girl certainly knows how to make a splash. Once upon a time, there were three young women who got into very big trouble. Now they work for me. My name is Charlie. And you keep her away from me! I thought he had a gun. It was my phone, you crazy bitch! Hey! Watch your mouth, Jerry, or you'll have to talk to her instead of me. Look, I told you, I don't know where Gabriella is. She disappeared three days ago. Where were you? Uh, Mercy Hospital, emergency room. I got food poisoning from a Cuban roach truck. Hey! Look, the doctor gave me antibiotics. We'll see. Look, I swear, I haven't seen her in a while. That's why I came today, because I heard she booked this show. Stalker with a heart of gold. Willing to walk through a restraining order for the woman he loves. You know, you may not believe this, but I care about her very much. He's a creep, but he's an honest one. Alibi checks out. Thank you. Now can I have my camera back, please? It still works. It's waterproof... Hey. What... Hey. That's private property! Sue us. And we find out you are involved, you'll be the one needing a restraining order. Hey, Mama. Hey, Daddy. Miami's still awesome. Uh, modeling's going slowly, but don't worr. I'm not asking for money. Ljusz' wanted f0 wish Daddy a happy birthday. And listen, I have a big surprise for you guys, so call me baa. All right? Love you lots. CHARUE". Gabriella's parents sent this over. Lflls' a video message {he y go! from her the day before she disappeared. Chasing your dream shouldn't turn into a nightmare. Agreed. That's why I want you to find Gabriella and bring her home safel. Her parents are devastated. We're all over it, Charlie. I have complete faith that you are. Keep me posted, Angels. You got it. Guys, check it out. I got these photos off of Jerry's memory card. I'll give the creep one thing: he takes obsession to a whole new level. So the other woman, that's Devon Ross, one of Gabriella's roommates. Looks like a hell of a fight. Wait for the big finish. Oof, that's not pretty. When did Jerry capture this? Day before she went missing. Miami PD interviewed all the housemates, but Devon never mentioned it. Probably some rookie detective that got tongue-tied around a bunch of pretty girls. Actually, I thought my questions were pretty thorough. Ray? Wait, you're Ray? The Ray? Her Ray? Abby, Eve, Bus, this is Detective Ray Goodson, Miami Metro PD. What, there wasn't enough crime in Tampa? When'd you transfer back? Six weeks ago. I missed... Miami. Gabriella Tucker, I caught that case. Yeah, well, her parents hired us two days ago. That usually means they're not feeling their tax dollars at work. Listen, we got everybody from Rihanna to the Russian First Lady in town for Fashion Week. Sure you don't mind the helping hand, then. Not when you almost drown the prime suspect. The guy had an alibi. We cut him loose. Usually, the best private detectives work within the law. Actually, the best private detectives solve the case. Can I have a minute with you? Alone? Okay, who is this guy? Give me the quick download. They were engaged. She got busted. He broke it off, transferred to Tampa. They haven't really spoken since. Double whammy... She lost her job and fiance in a two week span. Yep. She still into him? She hasn't given the ring back yet. Look who it is. You all right? Yeah. He said, back off. I said, hell, no. End of story. Good girl. Well, we've done a little research on Devon, Gabriella's roommate. She hails from East Lansing, Michigan. Been in Miami three years. Works steadily but isn't on the supermodel track. According to her Facebook page, she's on the hunt for a new roommate. Guys, look at this house. Someone's gotta have a trust fund. Not Devon. Her parents are schoolteachers. How do a group of struggling models afford a mini-palace in this zip code? I don't know, but Devon's got some pretty specific roommate requirements, all the way down to dress size. It looks like Abby fits the bill perfectly. Getting into that house is the best way to find out what happened to Gabriella. And how exactly do I land on Devon's radar? Leave that up to me, my camera, and Charlie pulling a few strings. Come on. come on. I'm not getting any younger. Let's go, babe. Let's go! Pop the hip. I want pop the hip. Get in it. There we go. Smile with your eyes. Work. Work. You know what, Devon? I'm not feeling it. Okay, babe? Selling fun. Fun in the sun. Own it, baby. Okay, uh... You know what? Blondie? You. Jump in. Let's go. Come on, come on. Okay, girls. Look alive. Look alive. Give me fierce, fierce, fierce. Yeah, I need more, I need more! Sorry. Okay. Stop. Stop, stop, stop. I'm sorry. Where are you from? The bus from nowhere? God, this is painful. Here, take five! I'm so sorry. This is so, so stressful. I... It's not like this back home. Yeah? Where are you from? Um, East Lansing. Capital of cold. It's pretty different here. Seriously? I grew up in Haselt, went to Saint Mary's. No way. That's amazing. I went to East. I'm Abby. Devon Ross. Hi. It is so nice to meet you. Don't let this photographer get you down. They're all prima donnas. All of them. Like, every single one of them. Hey, Abby! What? I want your stuff out of my apartment. Eve... Eve, what's going on? Your rent check bounced for the last time. I'm sick of it. No, no, l... l... l just booked a job. I can give you the money, I promise. No, it's too late, because I don't care about any of that. I'm not running a frigging charity here, so I want you out of my apartment tonight or your stuff is in the streets. Got that? You broke-ass model. Oh, my God. I'm so embarrassed. I can't believe this is happening. What is this? I'm really sorry. Okay? I'm really, really sorry. That was so unprofessional. It won't happen again. Yeah. It was. You're fired. What? Fired. Get her out of here! \'m somfi.! I'm sorry. Don't sweat it. I mean, you should know how many rent checks I bounced when I was starting out. I'm officially jobless and homeless. Let me help you. I mean, I was you until somebody helped me out. I have an extra room in my house. I'm looking to rent it. Pool, hot tub, cool roommates, you'll love it. That sounds really amazing, but I really... I... I can't afford it, so... I'm sure we can work something out. Michigan girls gotta stick together. Here. Call me. Thank you. I... I really, really appreciate this. Oh. Of course. All right. I'm just gonna get my... I'm in. I found another candidate. She's perfect. I know I said that about Gabriella. Just trust me. Devon, this house is amazing. Size matters. Hey, girls. Are those textbooks? DEVON". When we're not on the runway, we're studying economic theory and ambush marketing tactics. We're all enrolled in business classes at Miami University. This ends. This doesn't. Body like Gisele, head like Oprah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but I wanna know if she knows anything about Gabriella's disappearance. Modeling is a business and a stepping stone. Don't you have agents to help you with that? Have to learn how to take care of yourself, Abby, sometimes, even physically. John's our new krav maga trainer. Sometimes, a good axe kick comes in handy. And all the bedrooms are up here. Whose room's that? Gabriella's. It's really sad. She's been missing for, like, three days. Missing like kidnapped missing? No. Like, nobody knows. That's crazy. Um... When was the last time you saw her? Friday night, maybe. What was she like? She's really sweet. I mean, she bought our gardener cupcakes for his birthday... That kind of sweet. I'm sure she's fine. This is you. Devon, this is awesome, but, l... l mean... There's no way I can afford this. L... l'm not even remotely in your league. I haven't even booked my next job yet. Trust me, everything's gonna work out. Thank you. It's official. Devon lied about seeing Gabriella three days ago. She definitely knows something about her disappearance. I say we drag her ass back to the office, shove Ben & Jerry's down her throat until she talks. Okay. As much fun as that sounds, we need hard proof that Devon's involved. If we reveal ourselves too early, we could endanger Gabriella's life. I need to get into Gabriella's room, but there's a police seal on the door. We can't break it. You have any ideas? Yeah. I'm just gonna need Bosley to distract 'em. Okay, so one of the principles of krav maga is defending and counterattacking at the same time, so we're gonna work on this move right here. It's three moves. Defend, knee, elbow. Defend, knee, step through, elbow. Good. Now I want you to exhale on each move. Ready? Defend, knee... Good. Good, good. Again, here we go, and one, two, three. Nice. Can we take a break? I'm tired. No, wait, wait, um, not yet. Uh, part of krav maga is mental endurance. Close your eyes. All right, now we're gonna do the same technique, and I want you to visualize yourself doing it perfectly. All right. Here we go. Same moves again. And... Defend, knee, elbow. Make sure you keep breathing. Deep breaths in and out. And go. One, two, three. Okay. Great. Okay. Open your eyes. That was really good, and now, out of respect, we're gonna do a bow. Stand by to receive image via Dolce & Gabbana. Model on the outside, little girl on the inside. Police tossed her room pretty good, huh? Yeah, they left their scent here like lions 0n the Serengeti. It's Ray's case. No female intuition when searching a room. Well, every girl has a secret, right? She keeps all her shoeboxes. What is that, a model thing? Eh, shoes are like sushi, they don't travel well. Some women only fly them in their original boxes, me being one of them. Wait. Fifteen pairs of shoes, only fourteen boxes. There's a box missing. Abbs? Yves Saint Laurent. What are you, the shoe whisperer? She got a gift. High-end footwear and I have a special relationship. The prodigal YSL box. Hello. There's got to be at least $100,000 in here. And... a deed to a condo she closed last week. Coconut Grove. 6791 Orange Boulevard. It's in her parents' names. That must have been the surprise she was talking about in the video. The girls have company, the kind that entes without knocking. I gotta get back to my room. Mitch, seriously, come on. What's the big rush? Can't you wait until she's unpacked? Time's a factor. I have a potential client. Mitch, wait. Gabriella's been missing since Saturday. What is going on? Stay out of it, Devon. And don't forget who owns this house. Your job is to find the girls and not ask questions. Hi. I was about to, uh, go for a run. Who's this? Abby, this is Mitch Dawson. He's the attorney for all the girls in the house. You are quite the beauty, Abby. Thank you. That's very sweet. Don't be embarrassed, but I filled Mitch in on all your financial problems. I have an opportunity for you to supplement your income until your modeling career really takes off. Really? Nothing sketchy? Trust me, Abby, it'll be the easiest money you ever make. Let's talk details tonight over dinner. 8:00, China Grill. Okay. Sounds nice. Good. I'll see you then. L_ley_ Hey- So Mitch is a partner at a boutique law firm downtown. Guess his day job isn't paying enough. Sounds like he's running the models as high-end escorts. I don't know, but his supplemental income scheme certainly explains why Gabriella can afford a condo in Coconut Grove. Mmm. Mmm. We'll check it out. Abbs. Yo. Wouldn't want you to starve. No one's home. No security system. This is where Abby would usually pick the lock. Abby's not the only girl who has a way with locks. After you. Not bad for a struggling model. Not bad at all. What are you doing here? I traced some of Gabriella's online purchases, and this address popped up. You? Abby found the deed to this place in Gabriella's bedroom. I sealed that room myself. How did she break in? This is all you, Kate. I'm gonna go check the other rooms. Hi. She also found $100,000 in cash. What was Gabriella doing with that kind of money? She must have been in way over her head. Reminds me of someone. God, don't start. I did almost just shoot you. That's a problem, don't you think? I think we're both investigating the same case, and instead of us working together, you don't trust me. It's not that I don't trust you. I don't trust your decisions. Breaking the law almost destroyed you once, Kate. Destroyed us. I won't let you fall like that again. I'm not yours to worry about anymore. I will never stop worrying about you. Guys, come here. It's Gabriella. CHARUE". Angels, I spoke to Gabriella's parents. They appreciate all of the hard work you put into their daughter's case. I'm sure they'd appreciate it a lot more if we'd actually found her alive. The ME told me Gabriella was murdered the day before we came on board. There was nothing any of you could have done. Yeah, I wish that made us feel better, Charlie, but... Yeah, I really thought we'd bring her home. We may not be able to bring Gabriella back, but we can figure out why she died. Yeah, and take down whoever killed her. We've got to finish this, Charlie. Where do we start, Angel? Mitch Dawson, our number one suspect. Abby has a date with him tonight. I do. Abby, you're about f0 walk info whatever go! Gabriella killed. Be very careful. We've got her back, Charlie. Always. All right, is Abby late or are we early? It's Abby. She runs on Abby time. So Ray seems like a really good cop. The best in the department. How long were you guys engaged? Three years, two months, one day. Ah. Not that anyone's counting. Yeah. Yeah. We were two weeks away from the wedding. I'm so sorry. When it was officially over, he left... Took everything. Except the ring? Except the ring. How come you didn't give it back? I guess I thought... Once I pulled my life together, Ray would see that I'd changed. And that he would give me... Or us, a second chance. Uh, she's here. Okay. If anything feels off, just go to the bathroom and we'll pull you out. I'll be fine, Bos. Abby. You look amazing. Thank you. This way. How about this table? This looks cozy. Nah, I got us something a little more private. Besides, you can't seat three at that table. There's someone else joining us? Abby, a very important client of mine, Mr. Obregon. Hello. Nice to meet you. Hi. Please. I, uh, took the liberty of ordering champagne. Oh, champagne. What are we celebrating? An opportunity that will pay you $200,000 a year while you kick-start your modeling career. $200,000.. That's an awful lot of money. What... what do I have to do? Absolutely nothing. Shop, book shoots, work on your tan. Mr. Obregon and I will do the rest. Will you marry me? He has everything a man could want... Money, power, just not a green card. So you'll be legally married, but there's no intimate contact. All you have to do is take some photographs together and see each other for INS interviews. Look... All the other girls in the house are riding this gravy train. Trust me, Abby, it is a win-win. I'm really overwhelmed, so, um, this... Amazing diamond... Can I just go to the bathroom really quick? Excuse me. Is there a problem? No, no. They're, uh, they're all a little nervous at first, but, um... The money always brings 'em around. Figures the only time I ever get proposed to is while undercover. Gabriella was one of Mitch's green card models. Well, there's a reason why Carlos Obregon can't get a legal green card. He's part of the Meiojas Cartel. This guy's into drug running, trafficking... He's into everything. So Mitch was setting up the models with criminals. You think Gabriella's phony husband may have killed her? Certainly a good candidate. We need a name from Mitch. Well, there is a bottle of '89 Cristal on the table and I'm wearing Alexander Wang. Shouldn't take me more than an hour to get it. Who were you just talking to? You a cop? You really think I could fit a badge in this dress? You're gonna be bleeding in that dress if you don't tell me who you are. You really gonna shoot me, Mitch? I'm thinking about it. Think faster. The kids call it a swirly, Mitch. Give me the name of Gabriella's husband. I don't know. We know about the money, Mitch. We know about your little scam. Ladies? It's unanimous. Dunk him. No. No. All right, Mitch. You ready to talk? I can't. You don't know what he's capable of. He'll kill me. Yawn. No. No. John, I know Kate has Mitch Dawson in there. Who? Are you really gonna make me pull my badge? At your own risk. This is the ladies' room. Don't make me call the cops. Where is he? You followed me. I didn't. He did. This is a murder investigation now, Kate. I can't have you conducting rogue interrogations. Officer. You got to help me. Thank you, Officer. Look, I want to press charges. These women assaulted me. Shut up. You're under arrest. What? You can talk to my lawyer. I'm not saying jack. Get him out of here. All right. What? Mitch set up Gabriella in a green card marriage scam. Her phony husband could be the murderer. So Mitch knows this guy's name, and he just lawyer-ed up. Again, bad decisions, Kate. Let Mitch file charges. I don't care if I get arrested. It's not just getting arrested. Gabriella's killer could walk because of you. All of you. He's right. We just blew our only lead. Maybe not our only lead. There's somebody else who can help us, but, Bosley, I think we're gonna try your charms on this one. You're a good person, Devon. That's why you're here. I know Gabriella died because of the green card scam. She said she felt guilty for taking the money, like she was cheating her way towards her dreams. I told her she was being silly. Who was she married to? You really think her husband could have done this? It's a strong possibility, yes. Marrying these guys wasn't supposed to be dangerous. Just a way to make some extra money. That's the funny thing about pursuing our dreams. Sometimes people do get hurt along the way. And then we lose sight of the person we wanted to be. Who do you want to be, Devon? Right here, right now, you have that choice. I need a name. Simon. Simon Genks. Thank you. Simon Genks. Got it. Tall, dark, and gloomy. Scored a job at Caldwell Security, courtesy of his green card. Local address, Miami Shores. Staged honeymoon shots. Not this one. Army buddy. Check it out. Time to find out if Simon Genks is really Simon Genks. Guys? You see these grooves on the floor? Bingo. Sniper rifle. It's military-grade. Straight out of Call of Duty. If Gabriella stumbled across this... You okay? Yeah, it's just a graze. Simon's real name is Nikolai Denko. He's a Chechen war veteran turned assassin. Explains the sniper rifle. His wife was killed during the Chechen War. He holds the Russians responsible and was behind the failed assassination attempt of the Russian president himself. You think he's planning an assassination here in Miami? Ray said the Russian First Lady was here for Fashion Week. He came here, got a green card, and took a job at a security firm. He's been planning this a long time. We need to find the Russian First Lady. Police keep her itinerary under wraps. We need to contact the Miami PD. If you want, I'll call him. No. I'll do it. I got here as soon as I could. What's so important? I need your help, Ray. A man named Nikolai Denko murdered Gabriella. He's a Chechen hit man. We think he's now targeting the Russian First Lady. How'd you get all this? Working the case my way. Do you know what happens if I call this in, and you're wrong? Ray, look... I understand what you've been saying about breaking the law, but when it comes to saving a life, sometimes breaking the rules is necessary. So I'm asking you do you trust me? What do you need? Where's the Russian First Lady? She's watching the Haitian cultural dance troupe perform in Margaret Park. Cops were called off guard duty. Why? The Russians hired a private security firm, Caldwell Security. Nikolai works for Caldwell. We got to go. They want me to do another sweep of the Villeroy Hotel. Okay. Genks is sweeping the hotel. Guys, the First Lady's in the front row. Where's the best vantage point for the sniper? It's got to be a rooftop somewhere. The Villeroy Hotel. He's on the balcony. Go. We'll cover the First Lady. Got it. Hey. Step away. Somebody's trying to kill the Russian First Lady. We need to get through now. And who are you? We're private investigators. Look, he's already killed one person. Show me your credentials now. This is taking too long. Hey. Move. Move. Get out of the way. Get down! Shoo“ Stop! Police! Drop it! On your knees. Do as the lady says, or I will shoot you. That was Russian. What'd he say? He said, "You missed. I'll do it myself." Kate, tell me you got Nikolai. Yes, but there's a second shooter. He's going after the First Lady right now. Anybody got eyes on the second shooter? You guys, the security guard that just walked past me... I know him. He's closing in on you, Abby. Bosley, you, too. Nikolai's house... That photo... Bosley, the Caldwell guard, he's the second shooter! Nice shot. Nikolai Denko has been charged with the murder of Gabriella Tucker. What about Devon? The DA took her cooperation into consideration. She'll get probation for her part in the INS scam. Good for her. I know how much she'll hate wearing prison orange. I also received a call from the Russian president, thanking you for saving his wife's life. If you're Ever in Moscow, you have an open dinner invitation at the Kremli. Do svkianya, Angels. - Do sv/danya Charlie. - Bye, Charlie. Well, Moscow sounds great, but until we party in Red Square, I will settle for a vodka at Ice. What do you say? Oh, you can count me in. Why not? Miss Kate? Actually, I'm going to Cafe Nuvo with... Ray. Mmm-hmm. Sounds like a date. It's casual. He just said, "Let's grab dinner." Bos, weigh in. Who picked Cafe Nuvo? He did. Yeah. It's a date. Have fun. Enjoy. Bye. I almost thought you weren't gonna show up. Neither did l. But I'm glad you did. I want to apologize if I came off as a jerk the past couple days. I just care about you. I get it, Ray. You were just looking out for me. So... I've been thinking, and, uh“. I miss you. I miss us. I miss your smile. I miss the way you look at me. PL3Y~ So do I. Why don't you seem happy? Because I realize I miss your approval. I just... l wanted you to see that I got my life back together. But approval doesn't equal love. I didn't ask for this back. I know. But if I hold onto it, I'm just holding onto the past. And I have to let it go. Good-bye, Ray.
