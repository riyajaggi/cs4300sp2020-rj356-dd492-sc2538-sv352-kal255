 You know the drill. No large purchases. No boats. No cars. No down payments on that dream condo down in Boca, huh? Nothing that'll red flag IA or the IRS. Where's Kate? Right behind you. You're late. I had to cover my tracks. Your fiance still in the dark?

 Good girl. Let's keep it that way. I hear there's rumblings about North Beach. Yeah, well, let 'em rumble. We're in the clear. You trust me, right? As long as the circle stays tight, no one can break us. We're family, right? What? Company- Take care of it. Who are you? Amanda Kane. Reporter? I've been tracking you and your whole crew. How long? Six months...

 Long enough for me to expose you and your circle of dirty cops. North Beach bribery scandal is about to blow wide open. No proof, no story. Oh, I've got names, photos, e-mails, drop-offs... The story's happening. I've done my homework. You're not like the others. Those cops are a disgrace to the uniform, but you were top of your class. Where'd you go wrong? You'll never know. Prince, what's going on down there? Get out of here. Go! Oh, for a middle-aged mob accountant, you guys, that guy was pretty fast. Yes, but you did run him down in 6-inch Louboutins. Color me impressed. Why do I miss all the good stuff? Because every time we chase down a bad guy on foot, you drive. Ah. Well, I am kind of a genius that way. Who's the hottie on deck? He's cute. Mm-hmm. Ay. Our latest client, and he's engaged. Of course he is. Charlie, we're all here. Morning, Angels. WOMEN". Good morning, Charlie. I'd like you to meet Scott Foster. He's here because his fiance disappeared off a cruise ship in the Caribbean. It was supposed to be a three day trip... Uh, Miami to the Bahamas. That was two weeks ago. Your fiancee went on a cruise without you? She's working a story. She's a journalist. And what was she chasing on the high seas? She never talks about her work. The cruise line registers their ships in the Bahamas, which puts this case out of American jurisdiction. Cruise line give you any leads? They've been incredibly helpful, but the fact is, they don't have any answers, and there's no evidence of foul play aboard their ship. If she's alive, I need to find her, and if she's not... Let's just stay positive. Right now she's just a missing person. Scott, before we take your case, there is one last piece of business we need to settle internally. You'll hear from us soon. Thank you. All right, we'll walk you out. Right this way. Internal business? Charlie, don't leave us hanging. Our missing journalists name is Amanda Kane. I'm guessing Amanda Kane is a blast from your past? She's the reporter who broke the North Beach bribery scandal wide open. She destroyed your career. No. I destroyed my career. You sounded almost convincing. If you want to bow out... No. Charlie's the Boss. This could be more than just' a case for you, Kat'. Signing on is your call. I'll respect your decision. There 'll be no judgment. Well... You know me. Not really one to sit on the sidelines. Count me in. Pack your bags, Angels. The next Sunrise Cruise tor sets sail first thing tomorrow morning. Once upon a time, there were three young women who got into very big trouble, and now they work for me. My name is Charlie. Enjoy your stay. Enjoy. Thank you. Welcome aboard the Caribbean Dreamer, Mr... Bosley. I'll be in communication from my cabin. Stay in touch. Will do. Abbs, are you in yet? Approaching eagle eye now. Now explain to me again why you're undercover in silk Escada, and I'm in itchy cotton work clothes. Life is so unfair. Yeah, well, next mission, we are so trading thread counts. Your drink, miss. Oh. Thank you. Eve, you in position? Sitting tight by the pool deck. That sounded like a mojito. Pina colada. I take my cover very seriously. All right, guys. Time to find out what happened to Amanda Kane. Who are you? IT. I didn't call IT. Of course you didn't. You're not authorized to. But let's not whip out our pay grades. It'll only embarrass you. I'm sorry. I'm here to fix the bugs in your system. There's no bugs in my system. Yeah, well, you might want to double-check that, sport. Whoops. Yeah, I'm gonna need about 20 minutes to run a full diagnostic. Might be faster if you sync up with me from the port side. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Okay, Bos. I'm in. Copy that. Starting the download now. Ms. French. I found just the cabin upgrade you were looking for. Mmm. You work fast. Follow me. This was Amanda Kane's cabin. Nice work. It's been over a week. You think we're gonna find anything? Cleaning crew might have missed something. So what happened? You know as much as I do. Amanda got on the boat and disappeared. No. I mean, what happened with you after the story broke? You can Google all the ugly details. Kate, if you don't want to tell me, I'll drop it. It was like... a bomb went off. I destroyed my life, and I hurt everyone else in the process. I lost my fiance, my career. But you know what the worst part was? What? Facing my mother. That day, she was crushed. She says she forgives me, but she hasn't looked at me the same way since. Hey. You sure you want to do this? What? Search the room? No, not search the room. Rescue a woman who ruined your life. Amanda Kane didn't ruin my life. She saved it. Now I want to return the favor. What do you think that is? No idea, but, you know, we should probably bag it and search for Amanda's prints. Abbs, I think we may have found something. Me, too. I found Amanda Kane. I downloaded the onboard surveillance footage from the last cruise. I found her wandering through the casino. The guard's coming back. Abby, send me what you've got now. Hold on, wait. It looks like the fiance on land did have a rival at sea. Amanda met a man on the ship. The guard's at the door. Abby, get out of there now. Do we have an ID On our shipboard Romeo? Not yet, but I ran the fingerprints on the Lucite tube. They're Amanda's. Guys, check out the body language. She's not in love. She's afraid. Got him. Our mystery man is Roman Stone. He works here on the ship. Casino croupier. Maybe Amanda was tracking an illegal gambling operation. Roulette. It figures. It's a punk game. Sounds like you speak from experience. Oh, strictly a Texas Hold 'Em gal. That puts you in the lead-off spot. Roman punches the clock tonight. You track Roman. We track you. Gambling, glamour, I'm in. Fourteen red. Yes. Whoo! $5,000 to the lady. Whoo! Nice. Wager, sir? Maybe later. Hot night. Oh, they're all hot nights. I wasn't talking about the temperature. Okay, wait, guys. I'm sorry. Do you call these 11s or jacks? I'm sorry. I just get so confused. Wow. Oh, Iwin? Wow. How about that? Honestly, you guys, this is my first time. Oh. Thank you very much. I mean, I think it's just beginner's luck. I don't know. This is so fun. All right, that's the end of my shift. Ladies and gentlemen, have a great night. Wait. Where are you guys going? Don't you want to play anymore? Was it something I said? Sheesh. I know you're not counting cards, because I spot cheaters for a living. So how do you do it? Ever hear of just being good? I make it a daily practice. I practice being the best. At cards? And other things. Well, you'll have to tell me about it... someplace I can hear you. I have a room. I have a suite. You win. Watch those. She's in. Nice pad for a cruise line employee. I'm an independent contractor. Better perks. Ah. Now where were we? You move fast. Life's short. I have a feeling I'm not the first girl you've brought to your suite. Why waste the night talking about other women? I like you. I like champagne. I'm gonna go freshen up. Be my guest. I caught you... Putting on lipstick. Girl's gotta have some secrets. To mysteries. To solving them. Damn it. Yes. The bidders have arrived. I have to go... Mmm. And so do you. So soon? Some things are not meant to be. A flower? Yeah, but check out the tube. It's the exact same thing we found in Amanda's cabin. You guys, don't tell me, we uncovered a cartel of evil florists? Bus, can you get a match on the flower'? Already tried. Got nothing. How wide was your scan? Seven continents. Whatever that flower is, it's one-of-a-kind. Roman's guarding his Lucite-encased corsage tighter than a kid on prom night. It was important enough to make Amanda disappear. And to make Roman break a date with you. That says something. I don't like it. Too many pieces, not enough puzzle. We need a connection. You said Roman got a call? Yeah. It was kind of a mood-killer, actually. Someone told him the bidders were here, and that's when he grabbed his keycards and split. Bos, did you pack the micro cam? I did. Well, sync me up. Care to share? Cruise director's going to greet the guests at the casino. Good to know. I'll send pics. Good luck. Bos, you getting this? Prime time HD. Check out his boutonniere. Can you rate my rewards card? You guys get that handoff? Pretty smooth. Running his face through the system now. Check out contestant number two. We've lD'd Roman's bidders. Is there a pattern? Well, the thinner guy's Ivan Dunski. He's got ties to the Russian mafia. And the barracuda is Erica Leone, attorney for the East Coast's biggest racketeers. The other guy, Juan Molina, is the leading Cuban drug trafficker. Roman's dealing out his keycards to some faces. Faces? Legitimate names who front for big shots in organized crime. Ah. From Kate's passenger manifest search, she's identified four possible bidders. Three of them have already been to the casino. Who's the last bidder? Ricardo Stancati. Accountant with Detroit mob ties. Keeps an ultra-low profile. No image, no arrests, no internet profile. No way to see what he looks like. So I could be him. Could be pretty risky, Bos. But worth it. This is more than just a gambling ring. I can tell you he's scheduled for some casino time after his 8:00 massage. Looks like one of us is gonna have to rub down a bad guy. Good idea. Mmm-hmm. Massage? No. No. Don't look at me. I'm the cruise director. I've already given up my cover. I'm a dude. You guys suck. That's nice. Just a little higher up the thigh, honey. There we go. Just a little higher, babe. There it is, sweet cheeks. Why don't you just relax and enjoy the pressure points? How's about you shut up and give me the happy ending? Okay. I'll give you a happy ending. Once upon a time... The end. Bingo. You're back. Lam. I felt a little underdressed. You're late. The other bidders were hoping you wouldn't show. I'll be happy to disappoint them. Sweetie? Mmm. Stay close. See you later. 9:00. I'm approaching the cabin. It's 5250. Angels? The signal's jammed. Somebody doesn't want us listening. Angels? You're cutting it a little close. I'm not here for the company. I'm here to place my bid. Are you sure your employer's prepared to compete in the big leagues? You'll see. Welcome. Business is for tomorrow. Tonight... A toast. To the most beautiful flower in the world. None of you have met my boss. But he's successful because he's risk-averse. That's why you all have been drugged. The first thing to go is muscle control. In a few seconds, staying conscious won't even be chemically possible. Mr. Stancati. I take it you're not a morning person? Coffee? No thanks. That last drink had quite the kick. Yes. Yes, indeed. Well, why don't you get dressed... and join us outside? Ahh. Sorry for the, uh, the strip search. Trust me, it's nothing personal. All weapons and recording devices will be returned to you once you leave the island. Surely, you'd let a lady have her watch. Ah, not when it's housing a GPS transponder, no. Play with me again, and I will have you shot. You don't know where we are because I don't want you to know. We have business. Let's do it. Time to see the merchandise. It's about a five minute walk. Uh, watch out for snakes... And each other. Radar defected a speedboaz' leaving the sh/p last night. Guys, if Bosley's been taken off-board, he could be anywhere. It's a big ocean out there. Charlie, we're hoping you can narrow things down for us. Luckily, I can. I had my contact target the search f0 a few key nearby islands. Most of them are owned by the requisite movie stas and corporate titans. This one is the odd man out. It belongs to Carlton Finch. With a name like that, he's got to be bad news. He is. Finch made his fortune in manufacturing, mostly using sweatshop labor. He's a tax exile who's persona non grata in several countries, including ours. Two buildings. One looks like a plantation. What's the other? Pineapple factory. It was closed in 1976. Clearly, someone didn't get the memo. Look at that heat signature. Yeah, I have a feeling they're not canning pineapples. Exotic flower, active factory... History of forced labor. Amanda must have been onto a very big story. Last time she broke a big story, she broke you along with it. All the right bad guys got busted. Let's go get her. Finch most likely has private security and top-notch surveillance. Don't worry, Charlie. Your Angels know how to fly under the radar. As you can probably tell, I like to putter around in the garden. This way. But what I'm most proud of... Are the new additions. This... is where Island White is produced. It's the first of five flower processing facilities I have planned. Grown in your own fields? Right here on the island. When processed, this flower's five times more potent than poppy. Think of Island White as, um... Heroin on steroids. Okay. The bidding for US distribution has now started. Ricardo Stancati, you're the casino's high roller. You bid first. What's you offer? Charlie. Angels have landed. I've notified the Bahamian police. They're en route, but they're at least an hour away. From the satellite feed of the island, I've identified eight armed personnel. Use extreme caution. You need to find Bosley and Amanda. We won't let you down, Charlie. Good luck, Angels. Thanks, Charlie. Thanks, Charlie. Thanks, Charlie. Come on. Nice house. Being a bad guy certainly has its perks. I spot one guard. There could be more inside. Let's go say hello. Well, here it is. What's the matter, Mr. Stancati? Make an offer. That's why you're here. Maybe his employers can't afford to pay. I don't have that problem. $10 million for exclusive distribution of Island White, in cash. $12 million. $15 million. $17.5 million. I have an offer... Zero. You say Island White is the most addictive narcotic on the market. Where's your proof? It takes a lot more than hired muscle and a shiny factory to impress me. You want proof? I want 100% customer retention. Follow me. Guys, I found Bosley. What? Where? Here... Here, and... Oh, my God. That's Amanda Kane. What has Finch done to her? Looks like he's turned her into a human guinea pig. I'm going in there. I'm riding shotgun. I'll be your eyes and ears. Meet your first and only customer. Who is she? Oh, she's nobody. She have a name? None she remembers. Your narcotic's impressive. Just keep looking. You see this button? She controls her own dosage. Friends, family, career, future... None of these things matter to her now. This is the face of 21st-century drug addiction. Satisfied? $25 million. $30 million. $35 million. Ladies, you're off my grid. I've lost visual of you. You were right. It is a cabal of evil florists. We found Finch's flower patch. If we connect this to the sprinkler system with the rest of the greenhouse... We can wipe out every damn flower in here. Go get Amanda. I got this covered. Got it. Guys, I got eyes on Bosley, but audio contact is dead. I'll lead you in. Something's wrong. I'm losing power. Who the hell are you? No sign of Amanda. Abby? Eve? Don't move. Give me that. Turn around. Turn around! The last offer I heard was $35 million. Who wants to get real? $50 million. Cash. Who is this? No ID. Caught her sneaking outside with this. Ooh. Well, you're not a reporter. Who sent you? I don't like uninvited guests. And I don't like waiting. If your security isn't airtight, we can't do business. None of us will. Put her in the cell. Hook her up. Let's go. Move it. Oh, my God. Amanda, what have they done to you? You're about to find out. Get in there. M... More. I want more. This is private property. Call a cop. Aah! Think you can school me? Watch me. If I shoot you now, I can't have any fun with you later. You won't have any fun with me now. I might have a little. Aah! Yes? It's Stone. This better be important. Trust me, you're gonna want to hear this. I'm in the middle of bidding. Well, you better take a look at this first. This is the real Ricky Stancati. You've got an imposter. I appreciate the update. Ricardo. Do we have a deal? We have a rat. Or a cop. Ora Fed. Ohh. DEA agent, reporter, maybe. Listen, it doesn't matter. The point is, you're busted, and whoever you're working with... they're dead already. I don't need a gun. When I kill a man, I use my hands. Before you die, tell me something. Do you believe in an afterlife? I believe in angels. Ohm Aah! Aah. Aah. Put your weapons down slowly! Put 'em down! Amanda, I'm gonna get you home. Looks like we closed Finch's last sweatshop. You don't mind. Charlie. We're gonna be bringing in more warm bodies than planned. Need some transport, north face of the island. CHARUE". I spoke to the head of the Bahamian police. Finch and the bidders have been extradited to the US. Mmm. How about our favorite croupier? Mr. Stone was arrested when the ship docked in Miami, along with Mr. Stan calf. The cruise line is very grateful. They even offered you all a free trip. If it's okay with you, Charlie, I think we'll stick to dry land for a while. Mmm. Yeah. Mmm-hmm. Congratulations, Angels, and, Kate, I want you to know how proud I am of you. Thanks, Charlie. Interesting place to meet. Somehow it just felt right. How's rehab going? Slowly. You're a fighter. You know, I'm never going to be able to repay you. Why did you help me? Always with the questions, you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's, uh, it's a force of habit. You know, I tried to tell myself that taking dirty money was just a onetime thing. That I could walk away, but I couldn't. Once your story broke, it helped me realize who I had become. That's a first. I have never been thanked for destroying someone's career. I wish I could say, I took those bribes because I had no choice. Fact is, I thought I was putting bad money to good use. Spent it on the people I loved. Put my brother through school, paid my mom's mortgage... Called myself a hero, but I wasn't. Well, to be fair, you got mixed up with a very bad crew. I think I've got much better taste in friends now. So this new career... What's it really about? I want to become the person my mother can be proud of. The person I can be proud of. Well, for the record, you made a believer out of me. You know, this would make one hell of a story. No, no. I am a private detective. No, thanks. Thank you. Hey, you. Hey. Just came to make sure you were okay. I get it now. By rescuing Amanda, you were saving a part of yourself. I guess if you want to have a future, you have to make amends with your past, right? And you're off to a flying start. You want to get something to eat? Uh, thanks, but I have to take my mother to dinner. I told her I needed to clear the air. I predict a complete success. Mmm. You don't know my mother. But I know you. And I am always in your corner.
