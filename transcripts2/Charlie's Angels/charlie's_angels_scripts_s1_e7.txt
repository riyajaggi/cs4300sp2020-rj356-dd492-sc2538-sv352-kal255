 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. You guys, this is insane. It's like this every year. And just to be clear, this is not a real game? Nope. First official practice of the season. People get this excited about practice? They do when their team has a shot at winning an NCAA title. Ah.

 Look! Look! Look at Bosley! Ooh! Get 'em, Bos! So it's a scrimmage against the coaches. Now I know Bos loves working with these kids, but they are going to wipe the floor with him tonight. Oh, but he's so good. Look at him. You haven't seen the students yet. Here they come! That is Mark Bakale. He is good enough to get drafted if he wants to go pro. Aah! Better make that. That's all you got, old man? That's assistant coach old man to you.

 Don't worry. I'm saving it for the game, and don't end up on my highlight reel, young buck. No chance of that. Decent chance. Show me something. You have to admit, you're a little impressed. A little bit. Maybe. I am mildly impressed. Okay. Thank you. That's Mark's father. Where? All the bodyguards? Uh-huh? He's royalty. He's royal? How royal? Like, King of Ukata royal. Huh. West Africa. Atlantic Coast. Interesting. Wow. Miss Google Maps herself. My father had a weakness for expensive, exoficlocafions. We safaried. Um, Kate, your ex is here, and he's spotted us. Have you talked to him since you gave him the ring back? Well, he's e-mailed me randomly, asking me to play on his pickup team again. Said they didn't have enough good point guards. Mmm. 'Cause he's still watching us. He looks good. All right, guys? Love y'all, but stop. My relationship with Ray... ls... Finished. - Bosley! - Come on! Baba! Get down! Baba! Baba! Mark! Hey! Hey, Mark! Baba! Look at me! Look at me! Go with your father's bodyguard. There's nothing you can do from here, all right? I'll stay with your dad. Get him out of here! Let's go! Let's go! I can help! Miami Beach PD. Stand down. Once upon a time, there were three young womn who got into very big trouble. Now they work for me. My name is Charlie. Thank you. I'm taking this case. I was here when it happened. The perimeter's secure, and I got four pretty reliable witnesses right in front of me. Where did the shots come from? It must have been very high up, good vantage point. Maybe somewhere in those upper stands. Shooter probably walked right out looking like a worried fan. The King was taken down by two bullets, center mass. Clearly a professional. I heard four shots. Then where are the other two bullets? Bos, where were you and Mark playing? John, that's a crime scene. You... Kate... We were shooting around right over here. Shots rang out. I took him down about here. Which means... The assassin was targeting Mark, too. Where did Security take him? Hey, Ray. Hi, I'm Detective Millard. And who are you? Kate Prince. Yes, that Kate Prince. They're witnesses in connection with the case. Mark's too rattled to talk. Plus, we've got uninvited company. Carter. Always nice to see the FBI taking an interest in a case that might generate headlines. Ray, it's always nice to see Miami Beach PD. Trying to work cases they don't have the resources to handle. I've got the resources. Ah. Murder of a foreign national's big stuff. You think you're gonna find the answers before I do? Guarantee it. Care to put some money on that? Who's the guy in the fancy suit? That's Richard Mbakwe, the King's chief of staff and Mark's godfather. He'll be in charge here. Mr. Mbakwe, I'm sorry for your loss. Ah, Coach Bosley. Mark's favorite days at practice are when you're working with the team. These are my colleagues... Abby Sampson, Eve French, and Kate Prince. Is Mark around? We think he might be in danger. We really need to talk to him. No one's talking to my witness without my permission. Too bad he's not your witness. Mr. Mbakwe, we're private detectives. We're just here to offer you our services. I would be most grateful. Mark's in the back. Thank you. Thank you. Now he's our client. We'll talk to him whether you like it or not. Mark? He's gone. Think the FBI would be a little better at protection detail. Our client's disappeared. With a target on his back he doesn't even know about. We need to find him before someone else does. Mark is the sole heir to the throne. King Abrahim established a tenuous peace between the warring tribes, but their loyalty is tied to his family alone. So if something happened to Mark, it could trigger a civil war. News reports are saying that a man was killed during practice. But the victim's identity hasn't been released. And it' Won't' be- I spoke to some of my contacts at the Pentagon. D.O.J. and Homeland will stay out of this in the short term, and the FBI and police have agreed f0 a 48-hour news blackout. Unfortunately, social media hasn't. We need to move on this quickly. If word of the assassination gets out... All hell would break loose in Ukata. Mark's immediate return to Ukata and acceptance of the throne is the only way to guarantee the country's stability. We'll do everything we can, sir. So where do we start? Bos, you know Mark well. What was his story? Well, he's been in the States since he was 9. Uh, boarding schools followed by MSU. He really tries to keep the whole royalty thing pretty quiet. Just wants to be one of the guys. Sounds like any college kid. Except that he isn't. Yeah, exactly. He had the perks of being a prince. What did you want to be at 20? NASCAR driver. Sharpshooter. Acknowledged by my father. Note that none of you said heir to an unstable country. Ah-ha! There are no secure passwords. What are you up to? Well, Mark didn't talk about himself much, but he's a college kid in 2011. Anything we need to know about him is in one place. Who's the hottie? Dominique Berry. These photos are in her album. And posted a week ago. Look at the album title. "Best day ever!" Three exclamation marks. Looks like she's into him. Sounds like young love to me. And according to employment records, she's a South Beach lifeguard. Tower 76. There she is. Yep. Is it just me, or does Dominique look a little nervous? She's watching the beach more than she is the ocean. Dominique Berry? Yes. We're looking for Mark Bakale. Sorry. Who are you? I'm his basketball coach. Have you seen him? No, I haven't seen him in a while. Are you sure about that? It's important. Yeah, I'm sure. I haven't seen him. Sir, you can't go in there. That's... Mark. Coach. What are you doing here? I should ask you the same thing. Look, I was surrounded by my father's men, people I've known since I was a boy. Suddenly they're looking at me differently. One called me "Your Highness." I just had to get out of there. We have to get you to a safe place. Wait. Why? Because they're after me, too, I'm thinking. Yeah. They are. So who's coming for me? We don't know that yet. If you have any ideas of somebody who could be or anyone, you gotta let us know. My father sent me to the United States as a kid to get away from everything back at home. I really don't know what he deals with other than what I read about. If we made the connection between you and Dominique, somebody else could, too. Then she comes with us. Of course she does. Let's go. The cops didn't find anything in the footage on the third floor deck where you saw the muzzle flash. I'm sure of what I saw. I know, Abbs, but what you saw wasn't exactly where you saw it. The banner. It's reflective. Yeah, you're right. And it's at an angle, so... Our shooter was in a different section. There's our shooter. Searching through the surveillance footage. Hold on. Our shooter is... A woman. Call Bos. Hello? Bos, we found our assassin. Got a picture of him? I got a picture of her. Sending it to you now. Take a look. We've got Mark and his girlfriend Dominique. We're coming in. 30s'? 12 o'clock. Isn't that her right now? Yeah, that's her. Get them out of here. Get down! Get low! Get low! Stay low! Hey. You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Well, you're an Internet sensation. "Badass catfight on beach" got 10,000 hits. Nice. Did you get an ID on our assassin before the cops took her away? No, she didn't have much on her. Except for this... Uh, she tried to throw it in the sand after the fight. What is it, a locker key? I don't know. Maybe mailbox? No, it's a motorcycle key. You sure? Oh, yeah. You know locks, I know bikes. Well, that makes sense. She wanted to make a quick getaway after the job. It's probably within a few blocks. So she could walk down the beach and look like a tourist. Now that seems to be her MO. Well, let's go find her ride. Have fun. Security sweep came back clean. We can head to the safe house. Where's Dominique? Changing- She's pretty freaked out. It's okay to be scared. When I was 7, my mom died. She was in a car with my uncle when it was attacked. In one moment, my father lost his wife and gained a country. Your uncle was the king? My father was an architect. He loved to build things. He ended up building a stronger country. But it was never safe. The day my dad decided to send me to America, he came to my room and he told me he was sending me to a place where dreams come true. I asked him when could I come back home... And he said, "Whenever you're ready." That must have been hard. That whole first year of boarding school, I called him every night. Just the sound of my father's voice, it made everything feel like it was okay. I can relate. I don't know how to be a king. You're a natural leader, Mark. You have all the tools. You just need to know it. Every time you step out on that basketball court, youinspke thousands of people. Look, Coach, I always knew that I was next in line, that I'd eventually take over for my father. I just never thought it would be this soon. You know, things don't always play out the way we think they will. When I was 20, I had a basketball scholarship to MIT. I was gonna graduate and work for the NSA and change the world. What happened? I made some bad choices. I'm not ready. We never feel ready. Sure, there's another version of your life where none of this happens, and you stay here and maybe even become an NBA star. But sometimes life makes other plans for us. Sometimes we need to take a step back, think about the bigger picture. It's gonna be all right. - That's it. - Smooth getaway ride. There's a lockbox. Abby, grab your tools. Got it. Let's do it. It fits. Let me try. Just as I thought. Hold that. We win. People type their passwords more than anything else on the phone. HON, IIGII, IIHII have been used way more than any other letter. And "S" and "T" also. Ghost. I'm amazing at Scrabble. Okay. The phone is registered to Hillary Kimmel. That's a known alias in the US Army. She's a sniper. In the Ghost program. Hence the password. You said that was a known alias. What's her real name? Classified. Who is this girl? According to this, she's a ghost herself. She died in Afghanistan five years ago. What's a dead girl doing in Miami? I say it's time we pull some strings. I called an old friend of mine who just happens to be a retired general. You have useful friends, Charlie. Your assassin's real name is Tabitha Williams. Hillary Kimmel was one of her many aliases. According to Army records, Tabitha died in Afghanista, but her body was never recovere. She must have faked her own death. L2' looks like she became a private can tractor using her sniper training. Be careful, Ange. Whoe ver hired Tabitha has money and serious connections. Girl certainly spread her money around. She's got 15 different accounts linked to her various aliases. Best way to hide it. And look at this. She has a series of outgoing payments all for the same amount. Yeah, but coming from different accounts. I thought assassins were usually in the business of incoming payments. Where's the money going? Looks like our killer's got a secret. I think somebody should go and have a chat with our friend the assassin. And I think that person should be you. She's being kept at Metro. No. I'm kind of persona non grata down there. It's Ray's case. I don't think you're persona non grata to Ray. Besides, the assassin had no ID. Chances are Ray still doesn't know who she is yet. So whatcha got? I've got nothing. Her fingerprints were chemically sandpapered. We just come up with smudges. The FBI is showing up in a half-hour to take over. Hmm. What if I told you your suspect is ex-army operative with sniper training? That she faked her death five years ago in Kabul? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. How do you get all this? Come on, Ray. You investigate your way, I investigate mine. I have a proposition for you. You give me five minutes with her alone, no surveillance, in exchange for her name. Kate, you know I can't do that. Okay. Maybe Carter and the FBI will be willing to make a deal. Carter likes to win. It's been a while since I've seen a room like this. You got five minutes. That's all I need. Tabflha? Who are you? Another cop? I'm not saying a word until my lawyer gets here. I'm not a cop. Then what do you want? I don't know who that is. I'll help you. It's your younger sister Rachel. You've been paying her college tuition, masking the transfers as scholarships. But we're better at finding than you are at hiding. The cops don't have this yet, but I can share it. You talk to me or they'll haul her in and charge her with accepting the blood money that you received for murdering people. She doesn't know anything about that. She doesn't know that you faked your death either, does she? She Will. I wonder how she'll handle that. They'll tell her all about your past. Think about the legal fees she'll have to pay to clear her name. You help me out, and I'll make sure the cops never find the money trail between you and Rachel. Who paid you to kill the King and his son Mark? Look, there's no way you're not going down, but don't take her with you. Ray? Wait. Leave my sister out of this. The payments for the Ukata job came from a company. Mason Winkler, LLC. That's all I know. Mason Winkler, LLC, is based in the Bahamas. Has no product, generates no revenue, and filed no taxes. So it's a shell? Whose sole purpose is to hide the identity of whoever's behind this. Does it trace back to anyone? After doing a lot of looking, yes. Langley Diamonds. What's the link between diamonds and a dead monarch? Good question. May I have a word with you? Sure. I did some digging into Archer Langley. He runs the company. Officially, he's squeaky clean. But unofficially? The more I dig, the less I like him. But unfortunately, he's good at covering up his tracks. What about Mason Winkler, LLC? The connection is tenuous at best. It's buried pretty deep. There's no way I'm gonna get a judge to sign off on a search warrant. Are you asking for my help? Archer Langley is a bad guy. And... You need my help? Um... Yes. I need you. Okay. We're all at the safe house. So what do we know about Langley? Archer inherited the Miami-based family fortune about five years ago. He started expanding into other areas beyond diamonds, but that's still the company's bread and butter. Diamonds are Ukata's main export. Maybe this wasn't a homegrown political coup. Maybe this is just good old-fashioned corporate greed. With the King and his sole heir out of the way and a murky line of succession... Langley could spread enough money around the country, probably get whomever he wanted into power. Bos/ey, keep Mark and Dominique safe. Angels, letis' find out' whet' {he real connection is between Langley and Ukafe. Will do, Charlie. I did a rundown of Langley's operations. Corporate headquarters are in San Francisco, but he has a company server at his home here on Star Island. We need to get into that house. If we do, we can get ahold of the corporate records, see if there's anything linking the King and Langley. There's no way security doesn't cover every inch of the grounds. I don't know how we'll avoid it. I say we walk in the front door. How do we do that? Let's go talk to the neighbors. You guys look like you're having fun. I'm a bit old for a babysitter, but if you guys would like to stay, my parents are out for the afternoon. What do you say we hit the hot tub? I don't know. Eve, what do we say? I... I think it depends. Mmm-hmm. How 'bout this... The first one of you to break a window next door gets 100 bucks. All right. Nice job, kid. All yours. Wait, um... Could I get your digits? Not unless you have a hot single uncle who's straight. You gotta admire his persistence. Why do I attract juvenile men of all ages? 7th Heaven glass repair. Oh, lucky for you. We just finished a job up the street. I'll have our window techs there ASAP. Buenas tardes. Buenas tardes. - En Ira, par fa var. - Mmm. Dejame ensenarte Ia ventan. Esta por aqui. Lo ves? Esos ninos de al Iado son insoportables. Ah, ninos-Mmm. Te dejo. I'll stand lookout. Okay, Bos, uh, this isn't exactly a laptop. All right, you're looking for a USB port where I can access the computer's secure server. Wow. There are about 20. Any ideas? Start trying. Got it. Okay. Wait. Go back one. 16-bit encryption. It's gonna take a second. I'm in. There are a bunch of e-mails and contracts here relating to a mine in Ukata. This isn't about diamonds. It's about lithium. They must have found a vein in one of their mines. It's the essential component of cell phone batteries. Bos, didn't Charlie say Langley was expanding his interests? He started several new ventures six months ago, including Langley Telecom. Diamonds are a girl's best friend, but there is a lot of money in telecom. Enough money to kill for. Time to go. Now. Langley just got home. Abby, disconnect the drive and get out of there. Will do. Eve, what are you doing? We gotta go. When I said "now," I really meant it. Abbs, look at this. Wait, isn't that... Mark's girlfriend Dominique. Kate? Langley knows Dominique. I'll call Bos. Langley's coming through the door in five, four, three, two, one. Working girls just get prettier and prettier. And the clients get more and more charming. Bos, get Mark out of there. Dominique's working for Langley. That's how the assassin found Mark at the beach. Dominique tipped them off. Mark, come on. We gotta get out of here. I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Coach. What are you doing? She's the leak, Mark. She's working with Archer Langley, the man who had your father assassinated. Why would you do that? Sorry. Langley promised me that you wouldn't get hurt. He said he just wanted you to sign a few things. And you believed him? You don't understand. You grew up with everything. I'm not the prince of some country, okay? My parents have nothing. If it wasn't for Langley's help I wouldn't be able to go to school. I didn't have a choice. Aah! OW! You always have a choice. Did you tell them my father would be at the game? You're the reason my father was killed! It wasn't supposed to be like that. - I'm sorry. - Ladies... Yeah, the Dominique situation's under control. The alarm was just triggered. Someone's on the grounds. Well, it looks like two armed men approaching from the east. They must be pros. They just avoided our perimeter security. Dominique must have known they were coming before she made her move. Bos, we'll never make it there in time. Come on. Move! Get upstairs to the panic room and seal it like I showed you. I'm not going anywhere with her. You have to go and you gotta go now, or else they're gonna kill you both! You know how to use this? What are you gonna do? Buy you as much time as I can. Go! Hurry up! Go! Don't do it. Don't. Why aren't you in the panic room? Where's Mark? Where is he? He just took off. I... I... I think he took your car. Where's he going? I don't know. Thank you for calling On S2'. How can I help y? Hi, my name's John Bosley. My car's been stolen. Okay, Mr. Bosley. We'll contact the police. Thanks, Ray. Ray talked to OnStar. Mark's going over the bridge to Star Island. BOSLEY". I'm guessing Mark's going after Langley. Turning around now. Get down! You killed my father. You ruined my life. Mark! Don't do it. It's not worth it. Mark, you don't have to do this, okay? We're here to help you. Mark. Mark, put the gun down. You should listen to him, kid. Shut up! Listen to me, Mark. Think about what you're doing. I know exactly what I'm doing. You don't have to do this, Mark. Killing him won't do anything for you or your father. He can't get away with murder! He won't. Of course he will. Guys like this always get away with it. Not when they go up against us. Your father, he didn't go after those people that killed your mother and uncle by himself, right? He let justice take its course. Why'd he do that? Because he said you can't lead with vengeance in your heart. He was right. This is one of those moments you need to take a step back, all right? Look at the big picture. Nice shot. Look at you. I just wanted to stop by and say thank you for everything. I couldn't have gotten through this without you. You're stronger than you think. I'm ready to go home. Your father would be very proud of you. I just hope I can be half the king my father was. Just focus on being the best version of yourself. Got you a going-away present. It's not a jump shot, either. Something my grandmother gave me when I got my act together and moved here to Miami. Saint Christopher. Patron saint of long journeys, especially unexpected ones. You're ready. You know, I could always use a good chief of staff. I think Richard's got that covered. But if you're ever in the mood for a crossover, step-back, fadeaway in your face, you could always send over the royal jet. You know you're too old for that, Coach. Thanks for everything. You're gonna be great. I've got Mark's escort car waiting outside. We're heading out. Nice work. Thanks. So how pissed was Carter that you solved this one before the FBI? Not a happy Camper- Score. And before you say it, I already know that I couldn't have done this without your help. Mmm-hmm'? So thank you. And the invitation to that game still stands. We play later today. I'll think about it. Good. Goodbye, Ray. He invited you again, didn't he? You're going, aren't ya? Oh! Nice. Damn you, Goodson. Anytime you wanna hang up that shiny federal badge and come play for the winners, you let me know. Now didn't we have some money on that case? It'll be mine again soon. Keep dreaming. Hey, Jimmy, Ty. H9Y- H9Y- It's nice to know my welcome is still a bit worn out. I never thought you'd come. You're a little late to play. Maybe next time. So... I was actually wondering if you wanted to go grab a postgame drink, like old times. Uh... I'd love to, uh, but... I kind of have plans. Hey, babe. Hey. Great game. Hi, Kate. Hey, Liz. What are you doing here? We, uh... I was just closing up some stuff with the case. Oh, you guys need a moment to talk? Nope. We're good. So looks like you guys got plans. I don't wanna keep you. Yeah, come on, we'll be late. Let's go. J°Oh J°Oh Hey, you. What happened? Seems like my timing continues to suck. You guys remember Liz, the detective at the consulate? Mmm-hmm. Apparently, she and Ray do more than fight crime together. Well, we bring an alternative to being bummed about your ex. Cuban sandwiches. We'll trade you, ball for beer. What do you say? Deal. Ew. This stupid ball. Oh, my heroes. We love you.
