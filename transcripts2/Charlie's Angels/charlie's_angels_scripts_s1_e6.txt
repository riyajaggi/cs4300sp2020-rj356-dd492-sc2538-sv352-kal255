 Charlie's Angels (2011): Season 1, Episode 6 - Black Hat Angels - full transcript 
 The Angels trace a kidnapped artist to a gallery owner who was the victim of extortion. When they dig to identify the extortionist, they discover that Bosley's identity has been compromised, and that he has been tied to the kidnapping. In order to clear his name, they must find out who is responsible - and it's someone from Bosley's computer hacking past.

 Stop! Stop resisting! Get off of me! It's a setup! John Bosley, you're under arrest. I was framed! You're wanted in six states on counts of kidnapping, extortion, and murder. Listen to me.

 Get him out of here. Once upon a time, there were three young womn who got into very big trouble. Now they work for me. My name is Charlie. The City of Romance. Miami? Paree. Ah. Paris. Mmm-hmm. Ever been there? No one's invited me yet. You got a postcard. No message. That's strange.

 Someone sent you a blank postcard? Yeah. They only put my name and address on it. That's a little cryptic, huh? "John Eduardo Bosley." Well, one mystery's solved. I now know that your middle name is Eduardo. I like to keep my private life private. Okay. I'm just saying, maybe someone's trying to connect with you. Maybe it's your lost love trying to heat things up again. Not possible. Trust me. Mmm! So we couldn't decide if we wanted to start the day with caffeine or carbs. Yeah, so we went with both. Nice. We should get to work. Okay. Good morning, Angels. Good morning, Charlie. So what do you have for us today? A missing person's case. You know, we seem to get a lot of those, Charlie. We do, and you know why? Because when you're good at what you do, the word gets around. But I think you'll find this latest assignment unique. Who are we tracking down? I've taken the liberty of downloading some imagery to help answer that question. Bosley, would you mind? Already on it. Downtown Miami. Is this a surveillance job? No, it can't be. That's a drawing. An incredibly detailed one. It was drawn by our victim, an artist named Lee Bowen. Yeah, it's amazing. He drew this from memory. Lee had only seen the city once, from a window on an airplane when he first arrived. He was just 12 years old. Lee is 24 now. He disappeared two weeks ago. He's a living camera. And now he's gone. You suspect foul play? Well, it's too easy to rule anything out. Lee Bowen has no enemies and very few friends. He's a lonely genius. Lonely but not alone. A client is his agent... Zoe Sinclair. She'll be counting on you, Angels. Here you go. Thank you. Have a seat. Please. Continue. Lee is the... Kindest and gentlest man I've ever met. The police are doing everything they can, but there's nothing to work with. There's no ransom note. There's no phone call. You think he's been kidnapped. Yes. He's not the type to just disappear. He has a unique talent. That could be a motive for someone. Lee's one of a kind, in many ways. Doesn't care about money or career. Just lives to draw. If he didn't have me looking out for his interests, anybody could take advantage of him. He's like a brother to me. Where did you see him last? He usually doesn't leave his apartment. Although... Every detail helps. There's one gallery owner that's been interested in Lee's work. Too interested. What do you mean? He tried to poach him as a client... Aggressively. But he didn't just want to showcase Lee's work. He wanted exclusive rights. I couldn't let that happen. What was the name of the gallery owner? Stephen Loescher. The Loescher Gallery. I know the place. Pricey stuff. He sells high-end artwork to the superrich. And you said Lee can copy anything in perfect detail. A talent like that could be worth millions to an art dealer looking to sell forgeries. There's only one way to find out. You guys hit the gallery, andl1lcheck Lee's apartment for any signs of a break-in. Let's go shopping- Thank you, my love. Oh. Welcome to the Loescher Gallery. Uh, we usually don't accept appointments on such short notice. Well, thanks awfully. The wife and I are down from the Hamptons only for the day. Yes, you see, we both have a rather artistic streak ourselves. So we're looking for something bold with lots of color. Well, you're in luck. We have some wonderful things down here. The, uh, prices are on the wall... In the millions, of course. My God, it's hot as hell in here. Uh, sorry about the air conditioning. We're having it fixed. Yes, Miami sun's a killer, isn't it? This one here is my personal favorite. Do you have any Bowen? Well, I know Basquiat, Bacon. But Bowen? No, my darling man. You know Bowen. Lee Bowen? Perhaps I could interest you in another artist. Perhaps you can't. Lee Bowen's gone missing. We're here to get him back. Well, why come to me? I can't remember the last time I talked to him. We do. We checked your phone records. You're the last person Lee spoke to before he disappeared. That means nothing. This does. We have a picture we lifted off a security camera from outside Lee's apartment the same day he went missing. Does that help? Tell us where he is. I think you should leave immediately. Not happening unless you give us information. Who are you people? Last chance. You tell us what happened to Lee, orlshoot She's not playing. I told you. I don't know where he is. Do it. Paintball guns. Harmless. Unless you're made of paint. I told you I have an artistic streak. That painting is worth $1 million! Not anymore. Where's Lee Bowen? No? Please. Please! I don't know! My darling, your choice. Hmm, that looks expensive. Talk to us, Mr. Loescher. We have plenty of paintballs left. And I am ready to go full-blown Jackson Pollock. No! Okay. Okay. All right. They... They found out about me. I... I don't know how. It was extortion. Wait, slow down. Who found out about what? Uh, I might've sold some dodgy Warhols in the '90s. I... I thought I'd gotten away with it until last week. Out of nowhere, I got an e-mail with documents I... I had buried years ago. What did they make you do? Well, they wanted an artist, a human machine. I don't know what for. I didn't ask. I told them about Lee. Now he's gone. 'Cause you set him up. Tell us who pulled the strings. Well, I never met him. Uh, not in person. Whoever it was, he knew everything about me. I have an e-mail. Uh... Please, take it. Please, go. You've ruined some very important work today. No, we didn't. Lee Bowen's apartment came up empty, so whoever took him made the grab somewhere else. Well, that tracks. Loescher set him, and then the kidnappers snatched him where they couldn't be traced. Loescher was just a middle man. Well, somebody got dirt on him. And forced him to hand over Lee Bowen. Whoever it is, they made things really easy for me. This e-mail address gives us a direct line to their identity. Address, date of birth, bank accounts. So who's our bad guy? It's you. My identity has been stolen, Charlie. Your security system is one of the best in the world. How many hackers are good enough to have gotten through .7 Not many. This has to be more than a coincidence, boss. Definitely. First kidnapping, then extortion, now identity theft. I have a feeling whoever stole your identity kidnapped Lee Bowen. And is leaving a trail that leads back to you. This case has all the signs of a personal vendetta. John, can you think 0f anyone from your pas! Who would want to hurt you? Just some ex-girlfriends, the CIA, and every dirty billionaire from Europe to North America since 1997. Don't forget the mafia. Human traffickers. Drug dealers. Drug dealers hate you. Your good work has placed you in the crosshairs of some very bad people. This is different. If I get punched or shot at, I'm okay with that, but hacked? My firewalls have firewalls. Do you have any idea who could have done this to you? I have my suspicion. I need to be sure. Well, we're in. Where do we start? Where it all began. Thank you for coming in. It might be nothing, but your laptop could hold the key to our investigation. You see? This always happens to me. You mind if I try? Oh, please, be my guest. Let's see... I swear, sometimes I think computers just hate me. They're not as tough as they look. Just think of your laptop as a real-life office. There's files, documents, and trash. Trash? Is that what you wanna look through? Yeah, I know, it sounds crazy. You'd be surprised what a detective will dig through to find a solid clue. Check it out. All right. Your connections to the art world make it possible that you might have had contact with the kidnapper without ever knowing it. I'm glad I came to you. It's been difficult. You don't know what it's like to lose someone so close to you. You'd be surprised. Nothing. Does that mean we hit a dead end? Not at all. Townsend Agency is just getting warmed up. You know, if I was an identity thief with access to Bosley's account, I would be on a major spending spree right now. Me, too. Just saying. None of this case has been normal yet. It just doesn't make sense. Records show that my bank account hasn't even been touched. They didn't take anything, huh? Not a dime. Why would you bother to hack into somebody's account, set up a line of credit, and then not buy anything? - Wait a minute. - What's this? Looks like the fake John Bosley got himself a safety deposit box. Right here in Miami. High security. You know the words "high" and "security" are like catnip to me? Could be a trap. I prefer to think of it as a challenge. You tell that Coral Gables bitch I'm buying her out whether she likes it or not. Miss DePesta? Yeah, I don't care if she's my sister. Get it done. Carl Rogers. Branch manager. I got the call about our platinum box. Mmm. I'm eager to show you to our vault. If you could just wait here one minute. Yeah, I don't do "wait." We only allow a limited number of customers in our vault at any one time and... This guy is late. Fine. Please. Thank you. You have eyes and ears on the floor. Kate's in the surveillance van. Thank you. Your platinum box, number 1976, is right here. Our vault door, when locked, will remain sealed for a full five minutes. Like so. Impressive. It's all about security. We've got trouble. What kind 0f trouble .7 Explosive. A brick of C4 primed to blow in 30 seconds. Eve, get everybody out of the building now. Already on it. Ladies and gentlemen, listen up! We have a situation. I need you to evacuate the building immediately. Move quickly and calmly, people. Let's go! Go! Hell of a time for a manicure. If you gotta go, go out in style, right? Come on. Give me a hand. Get down! What are you doing? Stay down! How you doing? Everyone here is safe. How about you? Eve, you have to get out of the building now. We still have problems, okay? - And company. - Hello, John. This is Oswald. Who the hell is Oswald? If you're hearing this message, you now have 10 seconds to live. And I wan! you fo die knowing you paid for what you did. There is justice. Can you do this? We'll see in 5 seconds. 4... 3... Damn it. Come on. That was close. Almost had me worried. Please. It's me. Bomb is reactivating! Get down. Bosley? Abby? Talk to me. I managed to snag these cell phone fragments before police closed the scene. Yeah, we don't have much to go on. Well, at least you two are still alive. Find something? Well, it looks like Oswald gave up a partial print. So he wore gloves to convert the cell phone to a detonator... But not while handling the SIM card. He must've thought the phone would be destroyed during the blast. Now I can track the fingerprint, but... It still doesn't answer the real question. Who is Oswald? Oswald is my former partner in computer crime. We were Black Hats. "Black Hats"? Cyber slang for "bad guys." Hackers. But I thought you were a lone wolf in your bad old days? I was for a while. Then I met Oswald online. Yeah, those online dating sites never really work out, do they? I'd just broken into the Bank of Berlin. Started downloading funds unfillreafized someone else had beaten me to it. Oswald. I was impressed. Made direct contact, even told him how he could hide his tracks once he pulled out the cash. So how long did you two work together? Two years. It's an eternity in computer time. And we were a perfect team. He could break down any firewall, and I was the best at rewriting code. We pulled off some major scores. What was Oswald really like? Never met him. You worked that closely with a man you've never met face-to-face? Well, I guess it's not that strange, right? I mean, we've never met Charlie face-to-face. True. Finally, we went after our biggest heist, Bank of London. Except this time, the authorities were ready. Police broke down my door. I barely got away. But I'm guessing Oswald didn't. He evaded the police, but word is he cut a deal with the Russian mob to go underground. A deal like that comes with a high price. Yeah, at least a jail term ends eventually. The mob never lets you go. Oswald probably escaped and now he wants payback. Yeah. But why Lee Bowen? Why kidnap an artist? A fingerprint that leads to a condo lease. High-end rentals demand criminal background checks. If it is Oswald, the print is real and the identity is fake. Let's go pay him a visit. Unannounced. - Clear. - Clear. Nobody's home. We're too late. Not necessarily. Bos, be careful. Yeah, the last thing you opened went boom. Oswald thinks I died in the bank bombing. For once I'm ahead of him, and I plan to keep it that way. And what are you doing? Turning the tables. Oswald always liked to keep an eye on things. This whole setup in here, all these screens, they're his eyes. Bet you he didn't even change his password. Bingo. Old habits die hard. Oh, my God, it's Lee Bowen. He's shackled to the stool. He's a prisoner. What's all that stuff around him? Bos, can you zoom in? Already on it. Looks like some kind of engraving tools. Abandoned location, you guys. Lee Bowen could be anywhere. He's not alone. Who is that? Zoe Sinclair. She was never Lee's agent. Oh, my God. Zoe Sinclair is Oswald. Our own client set us up. You know, I'm actually kind of impressed. She hires us and leads us into a trap? To kill Bosley. Gotta say, Bos, you're looking good for a dead man. Thanks to you. Only question now is, what's she up to? Moving merchandise. - And plenty of it. - Yeah, but what kind? And where does a genius artist fit into her plan? She spotted us. Bosley. HeHo, Zoe. Or should I say "Oswald"? John Bosley. Still alive. I'm impressed. I live to surpri. Don't flatter yourself. All those years of hacking together, and you still thought I was a man. I just thought you were dangerous. You were right. If you're thinking about tracking my location off the camera feed, don't waste your tim. You always did plan ahead. And I see that you have some new women in your life. Let's hope they're less expendable than your lasz' companion. Did you get the postcard from Paris? Iz' wasn '1' easy copying her handwriting, bu! I managed. Whose handwriting, Bos? Who's she talking about? Forget it. She's just messing with me. It's what she does. Such loyalty. It's nice to see you still inspire that in the women around you. You came a long way for revenge, Oswald. Too bad you didn't get it. Revenge is just part of the game, John. If you 're frying a trace, you have less than 60 seconds. Doesn '1' leave me a l0! 0f time f0 warn you. Warn us? It's John Bosley you have to look out for. Bad things happen to the women in his life. You really think we're gonna listen to someone who just tried to kill us? You don't have to take my word for it. Just ask Elizabeth. They don't know? Shame on you, Bosley, keeping secrets from your partners. Again. We both took a lot of risks in Europe, Oswald. I never meant for you to suffer. You abandoned me. I lost three years of my life to the Russian mob before I escaped, and you were living it up in Miami. You're gonna pay for what you did to me, John. See you in heaven, Angels. Bos, tell me you got her location. Oswald timed it just right. She got off in under a minute. No one can trace that signal in less time. Except for me. You got it, didn't you? Got her location and everything she could ever put on a hard drive. You are the best. Okay, come on. We have a black hat to catch. This is it. I'll cover the perimeter. What does a cyber hacker need dryers for? Let's ask Oswald. Lee Bowen. I'll get Lee. We'll get Oswald. Go. Lee.Lee. Is anyone else here? It's okay. I'm one of the good guys. Anybody else here? Good. All right. All right, trust me. You're gonna be okay. My name is... John Bosley! This is the police! You're under arrest. Get your hands in the air now! Step away from that man! Okay. Officers, I'm a licensed private detective. Whoa, whoa! Hands where I can see 'em! Okay, okay, don't shoot! Hold it! Drop the weapons! Drop 'em! Get the guns out of our faces. Kick 'em aside. Identify yourselves. Okay, I'm reaching for my badge. What do they got? Pls. Looks legit. Townsend Agency. You should look it up sometime. I have a warrant for the arrest of John Bosley. Let me guess. That warrant just came through your computers right now, right? Yeah. So? We're dealing with one of the best computer hackers in the world. Goes by the alias "Oswald." She broke though your systems and trumped some fraud charges on me, okay? I'm innocent. Give me some proof. This man is a kidnap victim. He just rescued him. Yeah, you want proof? You talk to him. It's true. I was kidnapped. I... I had to make these. Yeah. Look. See? Look at all this stuff here. That's why Oswald needed an artist. He needed to make a plate for counterfeit $100 bills. Look, the real criminal's getting further away every second you guys keep us here. Officers, listen... My name is Kate Prince. I served six years Miami law enforcement, two undercover. Work with us. This man is innocent. We're all after the same criminal here. Help us bust her. You get the collar. Pull up his APB. Yes, sir. This guy's seriously dirty, Captain. Wanted in six states. I told you, you've been hacked. He killed a cop in Georgia. Take him. Yes, sir. Hey, guys. Come on! Stop resisting! Get off of me! It's a setup! John Bosley, you're under arrest. I was framed! You're wanted in six states on counts of kidnapping, extortion, and murder. Listen to me! I'm innocent! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Get him out of here. Nice work. Your hotwiring skills came in handy. Yep, didn't need 'em. Cops left the keys in the ignition. Thanks for the heads up on the cops, by the way. Yeah, sorry about that. I've been tracking Oswald. She's getting away with millions in counterfeit cash. No, she hasn't. You have an iPad? Yes. We still have time to nail her. Talk to me, Bos. Kate, I'm synching all the files I copied from Oswald's condo directly to you. You get it? Yeah, we got it. Okay, we're on the same page, now what? Check under "Recent Searches." I've unlocked all of Oswald's history. We can see everything. Okay. What are we looking for, Bos? Her exit strategy. Looks like Oswald chartered a flight to Rio under an alias. Of course she did. I'm plotting a route from our location to the airport as we speak. That's a lot of real estate. She could be anywhere. No worries. She's running out of options. Plus, I know just how to pin her down. Let us know when you're ready to roll. The chartered flight is a shipping company. And I just found a first-class commercial ticket under the same name. Air Rio flight 159 departing Miami International... Has just been cancelled. Or so she thinks. Nice hacking, buddy. Thank you. All right. Here comes the good part. She's gonna be pissed. What are you doing, John? Just thought I'd wish you a pleasant flight. You can't stop me. I've printed enough money for a lifetime. A lifetime you owe me. Uh, Bos. Give it up, Oswald. You've tried killing me, framing me. You hit me with your best shot and I'm still here. When do you admit you've lost? Game's not over, John. Come and get me. I know your weak spot. It's the women you care about. And that's where I'm gonna hit you. There she is. We got her! Let's go! Wait, wait, wait! Stop! She's already gone. It's a trap. CHARUE". I'm very impressed, Angels. Oswald didn't get away with a single counterfeit dollar. But she did get away. Only for now. We'll get her some day. Well, the best part is, Bosley's fake criminal record has been expunged. Oswald's bogus warrants look convincing unfilyou cross-reference them. What about Lee Bowen? He's safe. Back at home and back to work. Well done, Angels. Thanks, Charlie. Thank you, Charlie. Well, I guess that wraps up everything. Almost. Bos... I know you said you keep your private life private, but... Elizabeth. Yes. You can talk to us, if you want. I was madly in love. Elizabeth was the real thing. I mean... But, uh, she... Turned down a dark path and, uh“. I lost her. She died? I did everything I could to stop her. I thought love was enough. After that, I... I went off the rails. Met Oswald and spiraled right out of control. Until Charlie saved me. You know, you can't blame yourself for what happened with Elizabeth. Any time you wanna talk, Bos, we're here for you. All of us. Thank you, QUYS- Victor Sampson. When I was told that I had a visitor, I wasn't expecting someone quite so attractive. Please, have a seat. Have we met? Call me Zoe Sinclair. I'll have a new alias by tomorrow, anyway. Right. Zoe. So what can a poor, discredited Wall Street lion do for you? Straight down to business. I like that. I understand that you have an interest in a certain Charles Townsend. Your daughter Abby works for him. How did you know that? I'm plugged in. She traded one powerful father for another. Look, if you're here for some sort of pop psychology Q&A;, I'm not interested. I can help you unmask him. Isn't that what you want? Now I'm interested. It's a pleasure to meet you, Zoe Sinclair.
