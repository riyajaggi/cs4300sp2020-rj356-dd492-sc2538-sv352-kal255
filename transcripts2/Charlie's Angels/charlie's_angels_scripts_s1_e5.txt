 Has he issued a ransom demand? $5 million for the safe return of the Weber family. I told him my Angels were the answer to his prayer. We're on it, Charlie. Good luck. Eve, Bos. We have the ransom. Are you in position? BOSLEY". Gotcha, Angels. I've got eyes on the boa. What do you see? Five pirates, all armed. No sign of the Weber family. They must be holding them below deck. You two should drop in. We'll see you there shortly. All right, Abbs. You drive.

 Blue skies, crystal clear waters, and gun-toting pirates... Just another day in paradise. Abby-Thank you. All right, you want to go over the yacht schematics again? Got it up here. You good weapon-wise? Yeah. How about our air tanks? 3,000, both tanks. I won't let you down, Bos. Let's do this. JÂ°Oh Here they come. Escort them up. Just make sure it stays in focus, Jenkins. I like to capture all the fun. Okay, Abby. We're in posit/on. Get on board and find the Weber. I'm gonna go st the diversion. You don't look like kidnap-and-rescue specialists. And you don't look like Johnny Depp. Disappointment abounds. Pretty face, sharp tongue... Never a good combo. Maybe you should stick around and the boys can teach you some manners. Where are the Webers? You know the drill. Transfer the money first, then you get the hostages. We need proof of life. Of course. Hey, Theo. Mommy and daddy and sis are alive, right? Mmm-hmm. Look at that face. Would the kid lie? I need the bank account details. Do everything I say and we will get you out of here. BOSLEY ". Diversion's in place. - My son Theo... - They have him. Ladies, the Webers' son... Do you have him? Why don't you let the boy out of the chest? He's fine. What's the glitch? Theo's okay. You guys, stay here. Don't move until we come and get you. Technical difficulty. Next time you hijack a yacht, do it someplace with a better satellite footprint. Bos, time to blow this party. Copy that. Angels five, pirates zero. Get the kid. I'll keep an eye out for Mercer. Let's go. Hey, buddy. Cool hiding place, Theo. Thanks. Come on. You okay? Yeah? You want to go downstairs and see your parents? You're gonna make their day. Huh? Come on, buddy. Bos, any sign of him? No. Mercer's gone. Once upon a time, there were three young womn who got into very big trouble. Now they work for me. My name is Charlie. CHARUE". The Webers are on a plane back to San Francisco. Well done, Angels. We got Theo's thank-you note. I thought you'd like tha. Ohh. We are framing this. Oh, look. Bos, check it out. I see you three. Where am I? Sorry, Bos. I guess he ran out of crayons. Story of my life. Perfect. Angels, this thing isn't over. While he's unaccounted for, my contacts say Mercer is very much aliv. I'm surprised none of his men gave him up in exchange for immunity. None of them ever worked with Mercer before this job. He constantly changes crews, kills the ones who get out of line. He is' ruthless, organized, and only goes after big scores. Guys, he has blood on his hands, and we let him slip right through our fingers. Well, not exactly. Take a look at this. It's footage from the smart card I recovered from the pirate's camcorder. Check it out. Charlie, I'm sending you a real-time link now. Thank you, John. Uh, why exactly are we watching pirate torture porn? Yeah. Well, that's not the interesting part. Abby, can you fast-forward? Got it. On the same tape, I found surveillance footage of these two. From the body language, I'd say they're mother and son. No wedding ring, so she's divorced. Miami dealer plates mean they're locals. Any idea who they are? If they are in Mercer's crosshairs, they're going f0 be our besz' way 0f faking him down. You need to find them, Angels. The car is registered to Jennifer Rice. Her son Wyatt is a junior at Coral Gables High School. He's also a world-class polo player... Not exactly your average middle class activity. The mom's photo is driving me nuts. I recognize her face from my days in Manhattan's social shark tank. An old friend? No, and the name doesn't ring a bell, either. Maybe she changed it. Huh. I'll run her through the NYC DMV. Does Lisa Hanson ring a bell? She's the wife of disgraced New York banker Michael Hanson. They were page six fodder for months. He was accused of using his blue chip firm of laundering $100 million for a who's who of organized crime. Lisa is the one who turned him in to the Feds. Well, how many life sentences did he get? None. About a week before his trial, he decided to take an 80-story swan dive from his office onto Wall Street. - Ouch. - Uh-huh. Mercer must think she has access to her late husband's money. That would certainly be a big score. Time to go tell Lisa that her past may have caught up with her. Look, I changed my name and moved down here so I can give Wyatt a fresh start. Things had gotten so out of hand in New York, he couldn't even go to school without being harassed. Sometimes the Big Apple can turn rotten on you overnight. You sound like you know firsthand. Born and raised on the Upper East Side, corner of Vicious and Versace. We think Mercer's after your husband's money. You know, people think that Michael hid a fortune in some secret offshore account somewhere. The truth is, he left us broke. I don't even know how I'm gonna get Wyatt through college. Polo isn't exactly cheap. Wyatt got a scholarship from the Sunset Beach Polo Club. He's really good. Until we're able to track Mercer, our boss Charlie has offered to put you both up in a safe house. Oh... Safe house? Mom, what's going on? Wyatt, um, these women are detectives. They think we're in some kind of danger. Please, don't tell me I'm gonna have to miss my match tomorrow. It's my only shot to make the World Cup team. I know. I know. We're here for your own protection. Protection... Wyatt. I got this one. Hi, Wyatt. I'm Abby. Is this the part where you try to befriend me and we find common ground? Well, we got a lot more in common than you think. You ever heard of a guy named Victor Sampson? Yeah. Hedge fund douche who ran that Ponzi scheme. Well, you're looking at the douche's daughter. My dad wasn't a criminal. He never got his day in court. Then why did he jump? Lily... She your girlfriend? She's supposed to come to my match tomorrow. Ah. And I'm guessing she's never seen you play. Tell you what, if you're willing to follow a few rules, I guarantee you, she'll get to see you in all your equestrian glory. Deal? MAN OVER PA". Welcome to the Sunset Beach Polo Club's annual tournament. The best players have gathered here hoping to make the World Cup team. Right now, our competitors are warming up preparing for the big match later today. Are you sure this is safe? I'll keep my eyes on the sidelines, and Abby will cover the stands. Mmm-hmm. I'll be watching the stables. And you said you had someone on the field, as well? Yes, the vision that is number one, right there. How did he get on the team so quickly? Charlie has friends in all the right places. Looking a little rusty out there, Bos. You know, I didn't know he rode. I live to surprise you ladies. Yes, Bosley the enigma, wrapped in a riddle, covered in Ralph Lauren. Yeah, it's me. Those chick detectives are here. No, nothing's changed. We're still grabbing the boy. I'll tell you when. Here we are with the third chukka, and it's underway. The teams are neck and neck. Kate, any sign of Mercer? Not yet. Hey, Bos. Everything cl out there .7 Yeah. Everything seems normal. ANNOUNQER". And looks like number three, Wyatt Rice, is on his way to becoming our MVP. Abbs? I think I got someone. Guy with a camera and beard. Is it Mercer? Don't know, but he seems to be tracking Wyatt more than the main action on the field. Coming towards you now. Sunset Beach works the field. Beautiful neck shot, Wyatt Rice! KATE. Bos, we spotted someone. Stay close on Wyatt. Okay. Let's go, Wyatt. Be right back. Eve, we're moving in on this guy. I'm on my way. Hello? It's Mercer. What the hell are you doing here? I told you to stay away. You've been made. Where? Two girls comig on your right. Get out. Damn it. Bos, watch Wyatt. Eve, cover his m. Something's going down, Wyatt. We got to get out of here. No. Let go. Damn it. Bos, we've lost our suspect. Get Wyatt back to the agency. They got him. He's in the bak of the trailer. I see it. How are Jennifer and Wyatt holding up? Rattled but okay. They're resting in the guest quarters. Bos? How's your head? I'm fine. Uh, I ran Jennifer's financials. She isn't lying. She's flat broke. Well, Mercer wouldn't take a risk unless there's a guaranteed score. This guy from the polo match might be the missing link to our puzzle. Maybe Mercer isn't trying to fleece Jennifer. Well, he was in full kidnap mode today, so somebody's got to be footing the bill, right? Think our mystery man could be paying Mercer? That's an interesting theory. What's the motive? Oh, revenge is always a good place to start. Hanson screwed over a rogue's gallery of criminals. And if you can't get to him, you go after his kid. Do you recognize him? He was at the polo match. Sorry, I have no idea who that is. No worries. We'll figure it out. Double lemon. Neither recognized him. Ran his face through New York and Florida DMVs and our criminal databases. Came up with a goose egg, too. Charlie, please tell us you've had better luck. Angels, this kidnapping is not arbitrary. Mercer went after this family for a reason. Since his trail's gone col, we need to follow the mone. I contacted a friend at the Attorney General's office in DC. I wanted to get a look at the case {he go vernmenz' was preparing against' Hanson. I found a connection. According to Hanson's deposition, he had a power lunch every Tuesday at the Oyster Bar at Grand Central Station with a man he considered his mentor. Oh, my God. What am I missing? Who are we talking about? Victor Sampson, Abby's father. The Oyster Bar was my dad's favorite watering hole. He had his own table in the back. Getting on his lunch rotation sent a message to Wall Street that you'd arrived. Maybe your father can ID his guy. Okay, I haven't spoken to the guy in five years. Kate... But he has been reaching out. I... Abby, I know this goes above and beyond the call 0f duty, but' {here are two people 'is lives that' are hanging in the balance. Your father could be our best chance of finding this man and taking down Mercer. Okay. I'll do it. I'll drive you. Drive you? Your dad lives in Florida? Yeah, he's got a cozy one-bedroom condo surrounded by razor wire at the Clearwater Correctional Facility. Okay. That sounds good. All right, Bos and Eve are with Wyatt and Jen, heading to the safe house. Good. Pretty quiet over there to my right. I'm strategizing. Come on, Abby. He's your dad. Biologically, perhaps, but he's never exhibited any paternal instincts. How did things get so bad between you two? I'm 14 years old and, uh... there's this father-daughter dance at school. I really wanted him to go... To notice me, I guess. The night of the dance, he's a no-show. And when I get home, he's in his study. He doesn't even... apologize. So what did you do? He always locked his study. He didn't want me or my brothers playing in there. Afraid we'd break his prize Rodin sculpture. Mmm. He kept it in a glass case behind his desk. That night, I broke in and stole it. God, that's insane. So did you get caught? Please. It's me. The security company, a dozen security experts... No one could figure out how it got heisted. So it's a month later and it's his 50th birthday. My mom throws him this big bash at the Waldorf, a who's who of New York elite. I gave him his birthday present. Oh, my God. Mmm-hmm. The Rodin. Mmm-hmm. He opened it in front of everybody. I'm not sure which was more priceless... the sculpture or the look on his face. Well... He definitely noticed me that night. Good news. Charlie spoke to the polo club. The scouts liked what they saw. You made the squad. Are you serious? I'm serious. Oh, my God. Even my rusty moves couldn't hold you down. I've got to call Lily. Oh, hold on. Wait a minute. Until we find Mercer, you and your mom are on 24/7 lockdown. No cell, no Internet, no outside contact. We can't risk Mercer coming after you again. It's good to see you, Abigail. It's just Abby. How are your mother and brothers? I wouldn't know. They don't talk to me. Oh, seems we have that in common. Along with being thieves. Oh, God. I do miss your candor, Abigail. No, you don't. You always hated it. Henry was your favorite. He tried to please you, and look where that got him. I admit that my, uh, parenting style was a little unorthodox. Your daughter turned out to be a cat burglar, and your oldest son spent his entire life in and out of rehab. I would say your parenting style was a total disaster. Well, I explained to you in my letters how sorry I was. I didn't read your letters. Right. Yeah. You're here because you need something from me. Your help with a case. Oh, that's right, your new career path as a... What is it, a private eye? Sarcasm noted, but I'm not looking for your approval. It involves your old Oyster Bar buddy Michael Hanson. Michael? Yes. Well, the last I heard, he was dead. I was hoping that you came here to put the past behind us so that we can move forward. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you again. Abigail. Abby, please, just... Please. Sit down. Please. Perhaps we can help each other out here, quid pro quo. Mmm. I should have known nothing from you is ever free. Tell you what, I'll give you whatever information I can, and in return, I want you to come see me on visiting days. If your help leads to solving this case, then I'll be back. Do you recognize him? I'm sorry. I don't. He was involved in the attempted kidnapping of Michael Hanson's son. Why would he want Wyatt? Not sure. They may be after Hanson's money. Abigail, I can tell you from experience, a rich man has an infinite number of enemies. Huh. You need to try a different approach. Do you remember when I taught you how to play chess? Oh, yes, so we could spend time together without actually having to talk. Actually, I was trying to teach you strategy. Now the king is surrounded by rooks and knights and pawns, much like a powerful man. Now the rooks are for protection, the knights take the fall, but it's the pawns you need to look out for. They know all the king's dirty little secrets. So if I find one of Hanson's pawns, it will lead to the mystery man? Perhaps. Is that your idea of help? Abigail, you can accuse me of doing many things against you in the past, but I never insulted your intelligence. Look harder. You'll find your answer. I'll see you next week. I've run profiles on Hanson's employees and board of directors. They all came back clean. At least, as clean as a bunch of Wall Street sharks can be. Meet the personal staff. The pawns who had a floor seat to Hanson's day-to-day life. Personal assistant, nanny, gardener, personal shopper. I vetted a bunch of these. No one really stood out, except for... You. Francisco Gonzalez. He was Hanson's driver/bodyguard for over 10 years. He moved to Miami nine months ago, bought a restaurant in Little Havana. In cash. I'm guessing he didn't win the lottery. Abby, check out the second-floor apartment. We can distract Francisco while you sneak a peek. Lunch is on me. Apparently, the plantains melt in your mouth and the flan is better than sex. Francisco Gonzalez. Where is he? Oh, he's busy. It's the lunch rush. Oh, he'll make time for us. Mr. Gonzalez. Miami-Dade health inspectors. We were just inspected two weeks ago. There must be a mistake, okay? I assure you there's no mistake, sir. I'm gonna go call our inspector. Is that Felix Denton? Please, call Felix. Tell him that John Bosley and Kate Prince are here. You know what he's gonna tell you? Never heard of 'em. 'Cause he hasn't. We're health department internal affairs. We inspect the inspectors. And we hear Felix has been getting kickbacks to turn a blind eye on some pretty major health code violations. Listen, I've never paid any kickbacks, okay? Excuse me. Did you guys say something about health code violations? No, no, no. There's none of that here, sweetheart. Uh, please, enjoy your lunch. Dessert's on the house. Oh, okay. Okay. All right. Mr. Gonzalez, I need to recertify those reports. Otherwise, we will be shutting you down... For good. Start in the kitchen? Yeah. Come on. Damn it. What's wrong? My father was right. Whoever this guy is, it looks like he's been tracking Wyatt for weeks. Anything to ID him? Not yet. I'll download his hard drive and grab some prints, okay? Be quick. Looks like Bosleyis' running out' 0f stall time. Got it. Okay. This just took a turn for the strange. The guy has a pharmacy's worth of anti-inflammatories and Vicodin, not to mention enough gauze to wrap a mummy. What would he need that for? In my world, it looks like a plastic surgery recovery kit. I'm... I'm having flashbacks to my Aunt Cassandra's bathroom. I mean, if it could not be nipped, tucked, sucked out, or lifted, she wasn't happy, you know? Hang on. The guy also has a fake mustache and a fake beard. What is he, playing dress-up? I don't know. I've got our guy. He's running. We're on our way. Stop! Who the hell are you? Why are you stalking Wyatt Hanson? 'Cause he's my son. You're not gonna believe this. Our mystery man is Michael Hanson. You're right. I don't. How? Faked his suicide, then spent the last few years under the knife, seriously altering his appearance. And he topped it' off with {he cheesiest' dime store heard you've ever seen. Okay, wait a minute. Now who took a dive off that building? Mmm, that's the sick part. Hanson doesn't know. He... He hired a former black ops specialist to set up the whole thing. Didn't ask for any details. Wow. I guess money can buy you anything. How does Mercer fit in? Hanson hired him to kidnap Wyatt. He's been setting this up for the last two years, planned on spiriting Wyatt away to Argentina. Thafsinsane. Yeah. Being rich doesn't mean you have a tether on reality. No more games. Get Mercer on the line. I'm trying. He's not answering. Mercer could make another attempt. All right, Eve, bring Jennifer and Wyatt up to speed. We'll update Charlie and bring Hanson over. Got it. Let's go. Hi, I need to talk to you guys. Where's Wyatt? Uh, he's in his room. Wyatt? We need to talk to you. Wyatt? Oh, my God. They took him. No, the window's been forced from the inside. He ran. I know where he went. What's happened? Lily. Lily. What happened? Where's Wyatt? He came over, wanted us to drive down to the keys. A car rolls up and some men... They took him. Okay. Okay. We'll get him. We'll get him. Michael? Hey. Hey No, no, no. We buried you. We mourned you. And now you do this to me, to your son. I just wanted to give Wyatt the life that he deserved. What, by stealing him away from me and putting him in the hands of a murderer? Are you crazy? Shh. Look, look, I know this is hard, but we need to work together to get your son back. Where was Mercer staying? Noidea. I only met him once. After that, it was all cell and e-mail. It's Mercer. All right. He doesn't know you're with us. Play it cool. Mercer. It's about time you called. [have your boy. He better not be hurt. Few bumps and bruises... Nothing the South American sun can't heal. I have your money. This job got a little more complicated than I expected. That's not my faul. But now it's your problem. I'm tripling my fee. Hey, hold on. We had a deal. And now I'm renegotiating. Lincoln Road parking structure, one hour, top level. I can't get that kind of money together in an hour. Well, you better pull one of your dazzling Wall Street moves, or else your son is dead. Mercer's on his way. He's go! Wyah' in the trunk. KATE". I'm in position. Me, too. What's your problem? Get her out of the way! NOW! Going down? Come on. What's up? We were just giving Charlie the debrief. CHARUE". Congratulations, Angel. I know it was hard to see your father, Abby. I wouldn't have asked you unless I thought it would yield resul. Well, much as I hate to admit it, he helped us crack the case. He may have given you a breadcrumb, but you Angels cracked the case. Champagne's on me tonight. Good-bye, Angels. Ooh! Thank you, Charlie. Wyatt's gonna be okay. Yeah, I know. I just... I'm wondering why families have to be so screwed up. Not all families are screwed up. Yeah. Look at us. Oh, you guys. Expecting somebody? I had a hunch you'd be back. Oh. I, uh... I have something for you. A chess set. How emblematic of our relationship. I made it myself in shop class. You knew Michael Hanson was alive, didn't you? Why didn't you just tell me? Oh, you're a smart girl. I knew you'd figure it out. You want to play a game? Have we ever stopped? You know, I'm curious about your employer, Charles Townsend. Where did you two meet? Oh, wait, wait, wait. You've never actually seen him face-to-face, have you? Well, I guess I should be flattered that you're keeping tabs on me. Well, you're my only daughter. I worry about you. You weren't too worried the night I was arrested. Well, I was... I was angry. I was embarrassed. Well, Charlie gave me a second chance when nobody else would, including my own father. Mark my words, Charles Townsend has an agenda. He may not have revealed it yet, but when he does, that's when you'll know if you're truly on the side of the Angels. Your move, Abigail.
