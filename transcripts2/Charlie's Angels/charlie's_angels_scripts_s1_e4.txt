 You "re looking at' Cuba, Angels. It may only be 90 miles south of Miami, bu! it's a whole different world. Why am I guessing this geography lesson doesn't end in a free vacation, Charlie? Afraid not. You've been hired to find and rescue Tess Walters. She was kidnapped in Cuba three weeks ago. Tess 100k the semester 0f f0 do human rights work down there.

 Already on the ground. He's lining up an inside man. This person will make contact with you once you're in position. Of course, there is the whole getting-in-and-out-of-Cuba issue, Charlie. I've already taken care of that. You're going undercover as American tourists. Loud and obnoxious, I assume? Whatever gets you notice. Once you have Tess, I've arranged for a boat to take you to my yacht, which will be waiting in international waters. And what's our time frame? 24 hours. Good luck, Angels- ANGELS: Thanks, Charlie.

 Thank you. Oh, you guys, this place is adorable. You know, the whole country is just so quaint. Isn't it? Here you go, caballero. The bags are in the trunk. Come on, Eve. Whoo-hoo. Hi. Good morning. Hi. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. You must be Miss Prince. Uh-huh. We've been waiting for you. Are you three for check-in? Mm-hmm. Yes. Mm-hmm. We are ready to sun, fun, and party. Ooh. Ohh. You are so kind. Gracias-. Cold, hard American cash. Yes. Uh, let me see. I have you here. Um, take a drink, and we make sure your rooms are ready, and leave your bags. No problem. - Enjoy. - Thank you. Enjoy. Yeah, gracias. Okay. Fabulous. Thank you. Mmm! Thank you so much. Gracia. Operation Stupid Americans is under way. Acting like I'm on spring break may be the hardest part of this whole deal. Now why would anyone want to act like that? Oh. Are you one of the locals? Yo Juan Bosley, abogado attorney at law, a fu serv/c/o. Oh, a communist lawyer. That is so cute. You never know when you might need a lawyer. All right. Our inside man's in place. His name is Santos. He'll initiate contact and deliver your tools. Now let's pretend I just made the funniest joke ever. Oh, my God! You kill me! Es may I000-El es may loco. WOW! Oh, my God! Oh. Ohh. Well, it was so nice to meet you. Your English is very good. Gracias, senoritas. Ladies, let's go put on our bathing suits. Excuse me? Wait. Wait. I don't know. Are we getting arrested? No. What are you... On what grounds are you arresting these women? Who are you? Me? Yo soyJuan Bosley, abogado I'm from Havana. But they have done nothing. Oh. Oh. That's not good. I'm sorry, ladies, but I can't help you. Good luck. What? Are... are those drugs? That's not ours. Somebody planted that! This is some kind of mistake. Don't you speak American? Wait a second! Let us go! You can't keep us here. You are now inmates of the Val Verde women's prison. Here, I am the law. You cross me and you will pay dearly. Don't we get a phone call? We have rights. Americans have no rights here. W... what is she saying? I don't know. Once upon a time there were three young womn who got into very big trouble. Now they work for me. My name is Charlie. I'm guessing there isn't a salad bar. So, did you time all the guard rotations? Every 15 minutes, like clockwork. Don't worry. I memorized the maps and verified our intel. Any sign of Tess? Nada. They're definitely keeping American girls separate from all general population. You don't like your food? How do you screw up rice and beans? From your Cuban lawyer. Earwigs. 800-foot range. Should allow you to talk within the prison. I'm Santos. Is Tess Walters with the other Americans? No. She got thrown in the hole last night. What did she do? Attacked the warden. My kind of girl. Do you have my tools? Getting your friend out of the hole is gonna be impossible. Let us worry about Tess. Just make sure you're at the back gate before dawn. Our contact will be there with a food delivery van at 5:00 a.m. Don't be late. The hole wasn't a part of the plan. How do we get her out of there? Kate and I are gonna get thrown in. When I hit you, stay down and go to your cell. Yes, ma'am. This is all your fault! You bitch! Estupida! Let go of me! WOMAN". Hola, gringa. WOMAN". Hey, gringa. Tess. Who are you? We're private detectives sent by your parents. Don't talk. They'll hurt us. Hey, hey, hey. hey. It's okay. It's okay. We're gonna get you out of here. The warden told me that no one's ever escaped from this prison. Well, we're about to break that streak. It's hopeless. No. No, it's not. Tess, look at me. I've been in prison before, and the first thing they try and do is break your spirit, but you're stronger than that. You don't know what happens here. You can tell us. They force us. They let them have us, make us do things. If you don't do everything that they tell you, they kill you. I've seen it. Two of your girls got themselves thrown into the hole. They've been there for hours. They're very good at what they do. I'm not gonna change the plan now. This thing is a lot more complicated than you said. I'll double your fee. Just get my team out the back gate. I'll be there in 30 minutes in a prison food van. No one's gonna be the wiser. Just stick to the plan. Bring me my money. You know, you may dress like a communist, SenorSantos, but you definitely act like a capitalist. You're up late. Or is it early? Samantha Masters. So formal. Are you that way with all your exes? The last time I saw you, you were a hacker playboy who spent his days penetrating the firewalls of European banks and spent his nights doing the same to European women. Until I met you. We did have a good time, didn't we? A blast... Till I discovered you were CIA. I almost had you in Geneva. "Almost" doesn't get the job done, though, does it? No. What are you doing in Cuba, John? I like mojitos and rumba music. What about you? I got demoted when you ran. You mean, when you failed to catch me. Oh, don't worry. I won't make the same mistake twice. That's the third time you've checked your watch. Got a hot date in the middle of the night? You can't hold me. I'm the one with the gun this time. Then shoot, because I have to go. In the last three days, you visited Val Verde prison twice, paid off one of the guards, and bought a piece-of-crap van. That's a lot of prep, but I just can't figure out the score. There isn't a score. Okay? I'm not a criminal anymore. I don't remember hearing about you paying your debt to society. I was given a second chance. Well, aren't you the man of mystery? I have a powerful mentor who cut a deal for me. And what does this nameless angel of mercy do? Among other things, he has a detective agency in Miami. John Bosley, Pl? Are you serious? I'm here to rescue an American. She's... she's been held in Val Verde prison, and I have three other people on the ground with me. Where are they? Incarcerated. That sounds like a fantastic plan, John. If I'm not outside that gate in 20 minutes, they become permanent residents. You think you can flash those baby browns at me and I'm going to believe you? I don't care what you believe. Six American women have been falsely imprisoned under your nose, and I've got people on the inside trying to remedy that situation. I need to leave right now. You're not going anywhere. All my cards are on the table, Sam. Fine... But I'm driving. Come on. Okay, ladies. I'm on the move. Kate? Kate? Eve? Damn it. Abby? Water must have fried the earwig. Mine's not working, either. Your friend better hurry. The guards will come back for us soon. I don't want them to put their hands on me again. No, Tess, they're not gonna put their hands on you. We're getting you out of here. All right? This time tomorrow, you will be home. I promise you that. Thank you. Of course. It's why we're here, okay? It's gonna be okay. Abbs? It's them. I told you! It's okay. It's okay. Wait a minute! Where are you taking us? Don't ask questions. Move. Hold on, Tess. Get tired of waiting? Eh. Guards trying to give us special treatment. Nothing new. Come on, Tess. Homestretch. 5:15 a.m. Mainlines are crawling with guards. Let's go. The next time you go shopping for vans in Cuba, give me a call. I don't plan on coming back. Won't do much good in a chase. There isn't gonna be a chase. Buenas noches, senoritas. Alto. Bos, it's Abby. Do you copy? Good morning, Angels. I got you loud and clear. Then you're in position? Right at the back gate with the food van. We have Tess. You guys okay? Eh, nothing that a shiatsu and a pomegranate martini can't cure. See you soon. Por aqui. We're almost in the yard, okay? I can see you. No, no, no! We have guns. They have AKs. We need to be smart about this. You think we're third world? Huh? You think that by buying off that ch/vafo, you could break out of my house? Well, you're wrong. Wait, wait. No, no, no, no. Wait. We've been here for hours. There is no play here. There's always a play. We just need to find it. In broad daylight? We have transportation arrangements that aren't going to wait. Be that as it may, you can't save them right now. I get it, you care about your team, but you just can't... Wait a minute. Aren't you CIA? Can't you make a call? To what? Help with your unauthorized prison break? Those women are being illegally detained. I can't call for reinforcements, okay? 'Cause there aren't any. It's just me. So you weren't just demoted. You were exiled. To the worst duty station in the western hemisphere, thanks to you. MAN". Vamos. Alante! It's them. Where are they taking all those women? I do not believe this. That's Jonathan Cartwright. Is that supposed to mean something? That your rescue mission just hit a major land mine. Jonathan Cartwright's an American businessman, and I use the word "business" loosely. He only cuts deals with drug cartels and terrorist groups. The CIA insists he's in Venezuela. I told them he was here. What's his business in Cuba? Good old-fashioned capitalism. When the Castro brothers buy the collective farm, this country's gonna be up for grabs. What's kidnapping Americans have to do with that? I don't know, but if I nail him, that's my ticket back to the big leagues. Looks like we've both got skin in this game now. Come on. Looks like they went southwest. Don't do this to me now. Come on. Come on! Vamos. Adelante! Come on, ladies. I'll see you in a while, Tess. Make yourselves pretty. The customers will be here in a few hours. Come on. come on. Customers? Yeah, apparently we're the merchandise. The warden's using the prisoners as prostitutes. Pick a dress. How could you do this to other women? Oh, not to other women, just Americans. You've been doing it to us for decades. If you think we're playing dress up, you can go to hell. You do as I say or I will put a bullet... in each one of you, starting with your little friend. Please, just do what she says. Never thought I'd be this pissed off in a room full of shoes. Mr. Cartwright. Gentlemen. Here are some ladies who have chosen to grace us with their presence. They're here to entertain you, so I hope you enjoy everything they have to offer. That's Cartwright. He owns this place. I'm his favorite. Tess. Did you miss me? Why don't I entertain you? Maybe later. Play it cool. We're gonna get Tess out of here. I'm gonna find a way to alert Bosley, okay? Got it. Tell him to get a bigger van. We're leaving with all the girls. Time to get our party on, girls. I don't like this, John. We do have a lead on the person who took the Angels. Angels? Charlie... I'm putting you on with Samantha Masters. She's CIA. I didn't realize you contacted outside help. I didn't. Samantha Masters here. Jonathan Cartwright is the man responsible. Cartwright. I know the nam. He's a serious player. How long before you two can track him down .7 The man has eight residences in Cuba, never sleeps in the same bed twice. It could take a while. John, my boat will be arriving in Cuban waters in six hours. The bay is heavily patrolled, and I've pulled every string I ha ve f0 get' us {his window. If you and the Angels aren't there, the ship will not be able to wait. Keep me posted, John. Will do. Come on. I've got us a car. Look at this... Just the last drop. Un poquito mas, papi. Mmm-hmm. Oh! Wow. It's good. Oh, yeah. Damn it. Hello? Bos, it's Abby. Abby. I can't talk right now, okay? Track this call. All right, you got it. I'm on it. Who were you talking to? I said, who were you talking to? Nobody. He's drunk. He fell asleep. I was trying to wake him up. If he's too drunk, find another guy. Him. Go. Bosley's on the way. I'm gonna get us something to drink. Bosley's coming. We're leaving soon. Be ready. There's just one guard patrolling the front door. I'm going in. Pull the truck up front. Be careful. You won't mind if I borrow this. Drop the gun. Get on the ground. Don't even think about it! Drop your weapons or I'll kill Tess! Put yours down. What are you doing? You pull the trigger, all the guns go off, everyone dies. What the hell are you doing, Eve? I'm giving him a hostage. Get the girls and get out now. We're not leaving without you. Yes, you are. She's right. Let's go! Tess, get up and go now. Come on, girls, let's move. Go. Come on. Go. As fast as you can. As fast as you can. Go. Go. Let's go. Get in. Come on. I got you. I got you. GO, go! go' Let's go, let's go! What about Eve? We'll get her back, I promise. GO, go! I have the footage from the security camera. The woman... She's CIA. Her name is Samantha Masters. She's the reason I don't use the same phone twice. I didn't know she was involved. Do you have any idea how many deals went south today? I'm sorry. Aah! Oh. You're a peasant. I gave you a chance. You want your little share of the New Cuba? You're gonna have to earn it all over again. You have some training. You came here on a mission. But my guess is, you're not a government operative. No. You're freelance. Brilliant guess. Well... I'm through guessing. One way or another, I'm gonna find out everything there is to know about you. You won't get a word out of me. That's what they all say. We've got a yacht meeting us in the bay. It should be here in less than two hours. Until then, we need to stay together and out of sight. There is a clearing about 100 yards into the woods. Here you go. What about Eve? Don't worry. She's coming, too. Tess'? I need you to be strong. You keep an eye on the girls until we get back, okay? Attagirl. Come on. Let's go. Let's get you girls into hiding. Come on. Let's go. Come on, girls. This way. Watch your step. There we go. Every po/ic/a on the island has your mug shots by now, and Cartwright's put a bounty on your heads. It's suicide. I'm not leaving Eve behind. You got the other girls out. The CIA. would call this an acceptable loss. We're not the CIA. No loss is acceptable. I have a mission here. You need to get out and leave Cartwright to me. You can have Cartwright, but by the time you nail him, it'll be too late. I've never seen this side of you before. Heroic. I'm no hero. Then why are you really going back for Eve? Is it because of Elizabeth? How do you know about her? You talk in your sleep, John. Bos, you ready to go? Don't mention her name again. If you want to sit and babysit, that's your choice, but if you want to take down Jonathan Cartwright, we're leaving now. Your call. Remember us? We wanna talk to Cartwright. We know you can reach him. Mr. Cartwright. Hello. I'm gonna guess you're John Bosley, 'cause you don't sound like an Abby or a Kate, and your boss Mr. Townsend never gets his hands dirty. I'm not impressed. Well, you should be... Because your friend wasn't very cooperative. Good thing I have a lot of contacts and a lot of money. I hope for your sake she's still alive. Oh, oh. Proof of life. Of course. Here it is. What are you still doing here? You really have to ask? I told you to finish the job. Get Tess and the girls out. She's a tough one, John. Let's talk terms. Terms? How about you return our friend and we don't burn down everything you own? I was thinking of something a little less costly. How about this? You can have your friend in exchange for Samantha Masters. We have a deal, Mr. Bosley? Just checked on the girls. They're safe. We can't let Cartwright get away with either Eve or Samantha. You're right. You gonna talk her out of this trade? I wish it was that easy. Not a woman to negotiate. Our kind of girl. She lost her career because of me. I'm not gonna let her lose her life. Bos? What are you thinking? Let's go. Before you say anything, just hear me out. Okay? You don't have time for guns or a strategy. This exchange isn't just the smart play. It's the only play. I didn't come here to get you killed. Yeah? Well, this day isn't laying out exactly how I planned it, either. Then tell me you have something else planned. Oh, I have a plan. I give myself up, you get Eve. And later, when I fail to check in with my section chief, the entire town will be flooded with Virginia farm boys. And when they learn that Cartwright murdered me, they'll throw his smug ass in Guantanamo. Thatsounds awfully noble. They have an entire wall for anonymous stars at Langley for people like me. You asked me about Elizabeth. She was a lot like you. Smart, stubborn. I did everything I could to save her. Losing you is not an option. John, I'm sorry. I'm a public servant. This is actually in my job description. You know the drill. Yours walks, mine walks. Put your hands up. We have a lot to talk about, Miss Masters. Move! Move! Anyone think they can shoot before I squeeze this trigger? Drop your guns or you're gonna lose your meal ticket. Sam, what the hell are you doing? You have no idea the storm you just let loose. Oh, yeah? Who's the one with the loaded gun? Perfect timing. I don't think so. What the hell are you doing? The peasant is rebelling. All your operations are being nationalized. You do not want to do this. I do. Why should foreigners own the New Cuba? The revolution is over, the government is corrupt, and Fidel is as good as dead. I don't want to see any of you back in Cuba again. You cut a deal with the warden. An old friend of mine used to say, "Never do with a gun what you can do with a phone." Why didn't you tell us? Yeah, you know what she's done. Believe me, it wasn't an easy call. The fact is, I'll do anything to protect you guys... All of you, no matter what the cost. I have to admit, your plan was more thought-out than mine. Like I said, losing you was never an option. We seriously gonna let the warden walk? She won't get far. Recorded the whole thing. Micro-cam. Anti-government remarks, making deals with Americans... Boys back in Havana won't like that. Old-school entrapment. Learned from the best. And I know just who to give it to. She'll be a prisoner in her own jail in no time. Exactly what she deserves. We're on our way, Charlie. We should be in international waters in an hour or so, and hopefully Miami by dinnertime. CHARUE". I'll be relieved to have you back on American soil. Me, too, Charlie. Time to go home. I couldn't have survived this without you. Oh. You're much stronger than you think. Those are some pretty incredible Angels you've got working with you. Yeah. They do answer my prayers. Ready to head back to the States? I'm staying, John. Contact David Jonas, my Section Chief. His team will take Cartwright into custody when you get to Miami. What about getting back into the big leagues and all that? This just became the big leagues. We busted Cartwright's operation wide open. Once you leave, I'm heading back to his compound and I'm getting intel on every deal he's ever done. Sounds dangerous. This isn't the end of Casablanca, Bosley. Keeping a bunch of bad guys from owning an island 90 miles from home, that's my job. Guess that means you won't be Stateside anytime soon. No. Let me know when you are. I make a mean mojito. Get out of my country. The girls you rescued have been reunited with their families and Cartwright is in CIA custody. And how about the warden? She's now an inmate in her own prison. Sounds like Bosley's gambit paid off. I think this calls for a celebration. Mmm-hmm. Uh, Cuban food? That's not even funny, not even a bit. No, no, no. Burgers and beer. Ahora si. - Nice. - Thanks, Charlie. Bye, Charlie. Good-bye, Angels. Bos, you coming? I'll meet you all there. Charlie and I got some quick business to finish up. Okay. See you in a bit. They're gone. L'm glad Samantha turned out to be an ally. Yeah. Me, too. Did bring up some old ghosts, though... Like Elizabeth. I know you feel responsible for her death, but it wasn't your fault. I still think about her every day, Charlie. My daughter loved you very much. Never forget that. I won't. Good-bye, John.
