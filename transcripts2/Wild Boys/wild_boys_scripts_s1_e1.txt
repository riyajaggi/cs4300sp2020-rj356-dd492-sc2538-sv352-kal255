We're not carrying any cash. You know how it goes, put your }hands in the air. Then you won't mind opening up your strongbox, will ya? Don't be a fool. - You're outnumbered. - Two pistols against a shotgun? - I reckon that makes the odds even. - Except I always come with backup. Roll up, people. You know how it goes.

 Cash, coins, jewellery, anything of value. Don't hold out on me now. Lovely. There you go, in the bag, sir. That's a very nice necklace. Hardly worth the effort. There are pays in here. What am I going to will I tell the missus and the kids? Tell 'em that you got a rise. Don't forget that very nice watch, sir. You will hang for this. - What are you doing? - Excuse me. I ain't taking orders from you. I'm sick of hiding behind this mask all the time. The name's John Hogan. Say my name. Say it! Hogan. Mister John Hogan. Put it away. Are you afraid? Get a bit of blood on your hands, boys. It's not good robbing coaches anymore. Every man and his dog's doing that. These days you want to be famous, you got to kill a man. I like being nobody, and I'd prefer to keep it that way. If that means I'll have to shoot you I will. - You got something to say? - No. Don't let me stop you killing each other. Gotta go. - Which way we're heading, Jack? - Left. Right. Wild Boys - Episode 1 www.sous-titres.eu & Szaki What's it gonna be, Jack? Women or cards? - They'll both take your money. - I came loaded. Dan! Dan! What's her name again? Katie. Katie. Who's Katie? I'm Alice! Pig! Funny, real funny. Hey, mate. Good boy. - Mick. - Jack. - I was hoping never to see you again. - I'm sorry to disappoint. Carriage from Goulburn was held up this morning on the western road. - You know anything about it? - Nope. - You're reading fortunes now? - One of them got shot in the hand for his troubles. Don't have to be a gipsy to see your future, Jack. Noose. Open trapdoor. There's a new Superintendent in town. Things' gonna be different around here. They say you cleaned up Castlemaine. And the diggings around Golden Point. Contained the drunken minors, drove out the bushrangers scourge. - They say you're a man who gets things done. - If I'm permitted to do things my way. At last, someone new in town. - Superintendent Fuller, I'm assuming. - My daughter, Emelia. - Delighted to meet you. - And you. I only hope you won't tire of us too soon. Emelia thinks that Hopetoun is boring and dull. Am I wrong? Amber's thrown her shoe. I'm taking her to the farrier's. What, again? Nice to meet you. Alright, fellas. Let's see the colour of your beans. Silver's good. But gold is better. - Hi Jack! - Hi Bill! - What it will be? - Whisky. You boys, They think you?re so tough? I've robbed more banks I?ve killed more bags than you boys have got called do nothing-gooders. Yeah. I don't drink with heathens. I have luck. I shelt the pub. I might take that. Brought me, ain't? That's my gold. Give it back. Make me. I'll cut the little rat tail. Give the man back his gold. Come on, fellas, I feel like my luck is running on this one. What don't we build this pot like men. Here's your cut. Now apologise and give him back his nugget. You're welcome. Jack! Enough. Get out of my pub. - Good to see you, Bill. - Jack. It's three shoes she thrown in four days. It's just about a record. - You mustn't be very good at your job. - You must be riding the poor thing }her too hard. Or... - What? - Oh, no. - What? - Could be the shoes  were loosened on purpose. - What do you mean? - See this? Looks to me like someone chipped away at it. Maybe with a small miner's pick. - What would anyone do that? - No idea. I'm very grateful indeed. I can do with the business. Who's that boy, Sergeant? Conrad Fischer, the farrier's apprentice. So, stop at the minors'. Check their licences. Isn't that a job for the military and roll pensioners? Not anymore. Anyone without a licence, find them and burn down their tents. Who owns the commercial? Mary Barrett. Smart business woman. Owns the pub, butcher's, and runs a brothel. Everything a bushranger needs. Right. You need me to hold your hand? No, sir. How many times do I have to tell you, get the money first. But he said he was gonna marry me. - Night, Ruby. - Night, Mary. Get out or I'll call the troopers. Good luck. Traps are all drunk on your  watered down snake juice. What do you want? What do you think? That's for making me worry. I thought you were dead. I got you something. Where did you steal that from? Think you can buy me with trinkets? I can't live like this. - Not knowing if you?re even alive. - I've got plans for us. It's not gonna be like this forever. There's not such thing as an old bushranger. We'd better not waste any time. A whole month, Jack. Not even a word. What do you want from me, Mary? You want a conversation? - You two, upstairs. - Yes, sir. Bang, Jack. Tom, what are you...? Traps. Stay here with Jack, Tommy. I'm sorry. - Check every room, lads. - What's going on? We're looking for a bushranger, mam. At the window. Got you! Mr. Hogan, Mr. John Hogan. Name's Smith. Not after you went to such lengths to insure I'd remember your name. Not to mention your face. This belongs to you. You left it on the western road. Take it. It's fully loaded. Take it. Now you can go. As long as you promise never to return to Hopetoun. Yeah, I promise. Off you go, then. Go on. Wait! He drew first. You all saw that. - See your smoke from miles. - It's a good thing you're not the law, then. - That thing boils? - I run out of sugar. I'll just put some rum in it. I overheard a couple of drunk blowings last night. Gordo says a wagon's coming this morning from Goulburn, loaded up with the Queen's coin. We're talking rich pickings, Jack. Under heavy guard, Dan. You see the word is that this new Superintendent, Fuller, he brought all his men with him, and barracks in Goulburn are empty. If we pull this one off, we'll be set for months, mate. Months. You know how it goes, put your hands in the air. Are you deaf, old man? I said, put your hands in the air. I always come with backup. So do I. Run! Saving my life... the stupidest thing you ever did. Go ahead. Try your luck. Don't do it. Arrest them. Look on the bright side. Things can't get much worse than this. A fine result. It's a start. There are bushrangers at work throughout this district. Once it is known, not Robert Dale'd ply his trade near Hopetoun. Excellent work. We'll talk later. Did you manage to get her shoe fixed? Yes, Superintendent, I did. - Call me Francis. - Francis it is. - And yes, shoe problem sorted. - Good. Perhaps you can advise me, Emelia. Is there anywhere in Hopetoun worth dining at. No. You would have to go to Sydney for a decent meal. You know, as it happens I have to travel back then soon. Lucky you. Perhaps you'd care to join me. I'm sorry, Francis. Mr Fuller, but I'm currently involved with a young gentleman. Not officially, but I hope to be. Sorry. I understand. Mary. - Hello. - Hello, Mick. - What can I do for you? - I'd like to see Jack. Wagon'll be here within the hour to take him to the courthouse in Goulburn. I'll give you five minutes. Mary. Sorry, but I have to. We're in a happy place. And I've just been down fond of a kind. Surrounded by beautiful women. - Mary! - Okay, Mary's there too. Jack! Mary's here. Dan. So... this is your big plan. Not quite. I'm not coming to Goulburn. What a darling has to see you hanged. I won't hang, I hadn't killed anybody. Ten years hard labour tops. I've got to think of Tom. I was right. There is no such thing as an old bushranger. I've been in fancier carriages in my time. So long as it comes with good service. Come on. - Move it. - And hold it. Stand perfectly still. Do not move. Looks like Hogan finally got his wish. He's famous. - Put him in the back with the others criminals. - You can't do this. - I haven't done anything wrong. What did I do? - You're a horse thief. It was found in your lodgings. Belongs to one of my men. - I've never seen that horse in my life. - Tell that to the magistrate. In Goulburn. I can't go to Goulburn. He's gonna be groggy. - We'll be getting on the way, then? - You stay here and man the station. I'm in charge of all prisoner transport. Not today. I'm told you have some... history with Jack Keenan. You used to get up to a bit of mischief together. That was a long time ago. Nevertheless. When's the last time you had a bath? That's you, that's definitely you. What am I doing here? You won't get out of those. This isn't right. I didn't steal that horse. - I swear. I'm innocent. - We all are. What's your name? - Conrad. - You're the farrier's apprentice. I'm Jack. This is Stinky Dan. Just Dan. - Where are we? - An hour out of Hopetoun, on the ride to Goulburn. Look on the bright side. It can't get much worse, right? Why are we stopped? Had enough for you, boys. - Why are we stopped? - Chance to stretch your legs. Sit down. Why? I need to get out of here. I got nice cool water  out here for you, fellas. I bet you're parched. I need a drink. I said, wait. Get the chains. They tied the chains to the door. I say we just shoot them  through the bars. That's brilliant, Mr Clark. Then you can explain a prison transport full of bullets holes to the magistrate in Goulburn. Idiot. We'll wait them out. What do we do now? Hear anything? Maybe they're gone. - You wanna test that theory? - I'm not ready to die. There's still so much I have to do. There's this girl in town, I never told her how I feel. Who said anything about dying? Come on, nothing to do with dieing, big fella. You seen that Jack? Jack's gonna come out with a plan to get us out. Aren't you? Get away. They're trying to spook the horses into bolting. - Is the brake on? - And locked. Then they can pound away till the devil takes them. That's your plan? I don't know. Damn it. The floor. I dropped a pendant through the floorboard. They reinforced the walls and the roof, but not the floor, these woods are just nailed down. Dan, give me your belt. Quick. Loose your belt. Keep banging. Lots of noise. Keep on. Banging. Move, horses. We can reach the brake from here. One of us is gonna have to crawl underneath. I'll do it. This is going on long enough. - Clarke! - Yes, sir! I don't care how you do it. Get those doors open. Now. Shoot them! Shoot them! Jump! Come on! Jump. Jack! Get in there! Damn. I'll explain myself to the police. It's obviously been some type of a misunderstanding. There is no misunderstanding. For whatever reason, Fuller wants you dead. I'm just a farrier. Maybe Fuller's got a thing for farriers. Here we are. - Where's here? - You'll see. Captain? Jack. - Kapit?ny! - Dan! What are you doing here? We need some guns. What's with the three? Conrad, meet Captain Gunpowder. Sharps. .54 calibre. Breech loader. Enfield. .57 calibre. Muzzle load. Not as pretty, maybe, but faithful as a mongrel dog. Don't! Touch my snake. Handguns. Colt. Revolving belt pistol. Remington. Shots 86 grains of lead at a 100 feet per second. OK, Jack. Let's talk turkey. How much money you got to spend? Nothing. But I do have a business proposition. - Percentage of our next job. - Next job? Troops' payroll. Paid the last day of every month. Tomorrow. Which means they'll be sitting in their station safe tonight. That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard. - They won't be expecting it. - Of course they won't. - Cause it's a suicide mission. - Traps hadn't been paid for 3 months. There'll be so drunk by sundown. No one will see us coming. I'm in. I want 30%. - Stiff. - You'll need someone to blow the safe. You'll trust this galah with explosives? Or what? Goliath over here, he'll open it with his bare hands? Me, no. I'm no part of this. I'm no bushranger. Just a farrier. It changes since. - I want 50%. - You can blow the safe,  you'll have a third. - Forty eight. - Thirty five. - Forty. - Thirty eight. Deal. Dan? Can do this job with you or without you. - You're mad. - Tried to shoot us like dogs. That was nothing personal. Not personal. I'll regret this. - Another round for you? - On my tab, Billy,  and I?m good for it tomorrow. I got it. This one's on the house. Fuller'll catch him, sooner or later. I made this. It's for Tom. Tell him it's from me. What are looking me like that for? You think it's my fault? I'll tell you something, I ever see those cowardly dogs again... You what? You make a sound, it will be your last. It's a got a nice fancy chop jobs. Is that gonna be a problem? This might need a bit more bang. Where is he? Where is Conrad? Dead. Or at least he soon will be. Three unarmed prisoners against trained police. Want to tell me how they got away? I may have underestimate them, but it won't happen again. Of course it won't. They're halfway to Victoria by now. It fit right in down there too. A bunch of ferals south of the Mary. I know you're there. Show yourself. - Doing a bit of shoeing. - Fuller wants to kill you. - I didn't steal that horse. - I know. I think Fuller set you up. Why would he do that? Fuller's here now. If he sees you... I'm gonna head to Ballarat. Try the diggings there. Find some gold. Strike it rich. - Emelia, I'm inside. - You'd better go. You write to me. A good robbery's a fast robbery. You alright there? I'll show you... Shut up! I?ll be done when I?m done,  not a second sooner. Don't get so tetchy. Help! Do it again. What's wrong? I think we got company. No, he's just taking them off for being drunk. Definitely not coming in here. Definitely not coming in. - What if they do? - They might be asking questions. Stupidest idea ever. On three. One. - Two. - Hey, Fuller! You set me up, tried to kill me. You won't get away with it, I promise you that. Take your horses. Let's blow this thing and get out of here. You'd better duck. Damn it! Here's 38%. Come to Captain Gunpowder. - Buy yourself more stuffed animals. - I don't buy them. I kill them. I stuff them myself. Nice. - What's this? - Your cut. You earned it. - It took balls to take on Fuller. - I'm telling you, I'm not a bushranger. - Yeah, yeah. - Sure. - It's a dangerous occupation. - Take it, Conrad. It'll help you get the diggings, some equipment and a licence. Start that claim. Thanks. Don't get too cosy. I got stuff to do. I'm going this way. - Catch a coach to Ballarat. - When you're striking rich, - don't forget who you're mates are. - It's been a pleasure. Farrier. Wanted men, eh? It means we can't get back to Hopetoun for some time. You can always look on the bright... No Dan! Every time you said that things can't get worse, they always do. I can might hide  in Stanley for a bit. There's always a game at the pub, you want to come along? - No, Dan. - No? I'll do some riding. I'll do some thinking. Don't think too hard. I'll see you in a couple days. - Stanley. - Stanley. Alright. Here's your room. Johnny. - Here you are. - Thank you very much. I love you. You got it pretty good here, Shawn. Can't complain. You know Jack. There's no way he could have done such a thing. You people think you know Jack Keenan. You think he's a good man. A whole family. - Butchered. - Jack wouldn't have done that. I can't just leave. I've got to find who murdered the Ryans. This is about you getting justice. Or is this just about you getting even? It would be next to impossible for anyone to track us here. We have you surrounded. Is that right, Jack? Put your hands where I can see them. Give me a gun. Come on. - What did I miss? - Not much. www.sous-titres.eu & Szaki
