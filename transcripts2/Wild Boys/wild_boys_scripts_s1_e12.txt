 The only question is, who is next. I'll get your money. What do you think, you're doing? I'm sorry, I was just putting something away. Did I ask you to do that? Did I? Get out! Wait! Come! Tomorrow. You're here to... rob me or kill me? I wanted to kill you'd already be dead. I don't know if I think robbing you is the best way to get you to listen.

 Nor is pointing a gun at me. Fuller's working with the Butler gang. People being killed for the lad. Why'd the superintendent do that? Not certain, but I'm guessing gold. I saw Fuller with Frank Butler's man, Cec Wiley down the Old George's farm. Now Cec Wiley is dead. So I'd say Fuller's tying up loose ends. He was making your life tough. I mean naturally you'd wanna be rid of him. Fuller goes, you replace him my life wouldn't change. Do you think you're running this town, you're not. Fuller's the one with the power now. Maybe wants this to be his town. You've made your point. Oh. If you're coming to my house again, I'll kill you. Subtitle: Szaki&LaDa; Sync: mercurian You're the bloke looking for William Jameson? I'm Clarence Booth, Scott & Wooley, lawyers of London. I'm William Jameson. Says here...there is a... substantial sum of money involved. - The resemblance isn't strong. - Well, five summers out here, your own mother wouldn't recognise ya. And what is your mother's name? Mary? Unless the heat has affected your memory too you're not the man I'm after. Good day, sir! Pay me the money or I shoot you where you stand. I don't have the money on me. It's in the bank. Well then this will have to do. And your wallet. What else you got? Shiny! It' a dead cert... Same weak chin, thin, english miserable lips. It's nothing like me. I don't know. Capt'n is right about that week chin. I'm not gonna masquerade myself, as some William Jameson. Why not? You masqueraded as everything else. Don't worry! I tore every one of them down so nobody else'll get the same idea. That was a waste of time, wasn't it? Cause that Booth character is gonna want some proof. Jack says, it's probably worth giving it a go. Well if Jacksie wants it, Jack just gonna do it then. What Jack's worried about is getting rid Fuller. Well, I tell you, if he does that, every trap in the colonies gonna be here hunting us down. He is not that stupid. Weak chin! And so we proceed to auction of the goods and chattels of the late George Jenkins of Old East Road. But one is the lifestock. 3 sheep, 1 ram, 5 hens and a rooster. You really gonna make a bid for the property? It's not much good for farming but it'd be perfect for abattoir. 1 pound, 4 shillings! Thank you, nice round here. 1 pound, 4 shillings. 1 pound, 5. You sure it won't stretch you too much financially? Sheeps sell fine to 40 pounds. I can cope with that. Another income could help. I suppose so. Sold! For 1 pound 10 shillings. Next! We have these do-lovely chairs. I'd be happy to purchase those for you if you like, Miss Catherine. Thank you Frederick, but I do have my own furniture. Will you be bidding on anything? Old George had a Brown Bess there in there so I'm loving attention. Aren't we all? And going once, twice. Sold. Just come and have a look. Family jewels, but useful nonetheless. A penny to begin. To start up the bet. And we're on our way. Will anyone advance me on a penny? - Yeah! - 2 pennys over to the right. No more? 2 pennys going once, twice, sold! And now we have some weapons! This sir, a Brown Bess... Thank you, sir! What am I bid? Very well oiled. And if you have a nagging mother-in-law getting in trouble this won't let you down. What am I bid? Clarence Booth? William Jameson. You bear resemblance to the photograph. Well I should, because that's me. Then you'll know your birthdate. First of May. '31. And your mother's first name? A florin. What was the question again? Your mother's first name. Beatrice. And the name of your mother youngest sister. - 4 shillings! - 4 shillings! She didn't have one. Right on the money, well... This is a pleasure. Sold! 4 shillings. Who bought these, please show your hand. Thank you, sir! Ladies and gentleman you'd so far purchased some excellent items. I've got to get going. Can we do this in another time? Out of town where Creek Road meets the longest track, shall we say at 1 o'clock? Sell of the property at lot 134 of Old East Road. Good size family farm if needs be defends yourself. Most of the work done for you. Hey, hey! Change your mind, did ya? Well, just thought I'd have a little look. Have you told Jack? I don't know where Jack is. Do you know where he is? - You're lucky I was here. - Oh yeah. How did you know about the aunt? Well, it's just simple poker, Cap. You see, I could see his tell, when I'm playing poker I look him straight in the eye, they pretty much tell me everything that I wanted to know. - Lucky guess. - It was. It was a lucky guess. - I gotta get out of here. - Go! - Need a hand? - I do, actually. - What happened there? - Ah, I jammed it in a door. Was all my fault. Ruby! What's going on? Did Fuller do this? Please, you mustn't tell anybody. Especially not Mary. - I've been seeing him in my own time. - But, if he hurt you... I know, but... I went to put something in the drawer and he thought I was snooping. So, it was all my fault. - Any increase on 30? - 35 pound! - 38! - 38 pound! Do I have 40? Looking for 40. - 40. - 40 pounds we have! - 40 pounds. Do we have an increase on... - 50 pounds! 50 pounds! 50 pounds, 50 pounds going once. - 50 pounds... - Stop the auction! Excuse me! Ladies and gentlemen I'm afraid this auction is over. Apparently George Jenkins lodged a will with Mr Harper 2 months ago bequeathing the property to local school and naming Miss Catherine Bell as executor. Congratulations ma'am. - What just happened? - You just inherited a farm. - There will be other properties. - I'm sure you're right. Maybe we can look for something together. Good afternoon Mrs Barrett. Sergeant! May I have a moment of you have time. We'll talk later. Thanks Mick. It's a delicate matter for both of us. Is there a rumor that the superintendent is somehow involved with Frank Butler. - It's hard to believe. - Indeed. The...the absurdity of the idea... Nonetheless these killings remain unsolved. Superintendent Fuller is a dedicated police officer, sir. No doubt he is... and no doubt so are you. Therefore I'd appreciate you keeping an eye on the superintendent, just between us. I'm not comfortable with this, sir. I understand. But if Fuller is corrupt, someone would need to step up and take his place. You went to Fife? Gutsy him getting rid of Fuller? I say, I appeal to his self interest it might do the job. Have you meeting Booth at one we should get going. Hey, it's all right. - I can handle it. - Oh, you better watch him. You gonna take the cash and run. Have I ever done that before? Have I ever let you guys down, would I did something like that? Easy, easy! Just having a crack. It's a joke, man! I was just... I just don't want complicate things, that's all. All right? Because if we going to see this Booth character he ask you the same questions that he asked me, and you give him a different answer. You know that just gonna make him suspicious. Sure. Mr Booth? Mr Booth? Easy mate. Easy. Dan! - What are you doin' here? - Saving you apparently. Frederick, when I sell this farm I can afford to buy books, and pencils... - and I can send away to London for a set of Encyclopedias - Yeah. I mean most of these children don't even have shoes. Excuse me, ma'am. Clarence Traingrove I'm very keen on that property and my offer of 50 pounds - still stands. - Yes. Good! All right! - Um...what do we do now? - Hold on! Why are you so interested in that book? I was raised outside Turner in a little place just like that. and when I first saw it, it reminded me of my dear departed mother and father. Yeah. And my stuffed wombats giving birth to twins. I think we're talkin' about gold here here Miss Catherine. That place could be worth ten times what he's offering. And the lady graciously declines your offer. 60 pounds then? I'd give almost anything to feel my mothers presence again. Oh, that or a s?ance. That would be my suggestion. - You sure about this Frederick? - Oh, yeah! We saw Fuller fella, there nearby the creek. Maybe he was fishing. Yeah. A goldfish. Miss Catherine, people don't just offer 60 quid. Frederick! Frederick, is this gold? Run-of-the-mill quartz, Miss Catherine. You got it. I'll stay on a bit. Must be something here for a bloke to offer such a big quid. Yeah, must be something. Why would Booth try kill you. Well, I don't think it was him, mate. Maybe, maybe someone thought I was him. Heard he had some quarter. Well, I'll just wait till sunset. - Take Conrad with to town, will ya? - As long as he keeps his distance. - Where are you goin'? - I am going back to Old George's. The girl has a hat. Very good, Ruby! I saw the prettiest hat in Mr Wrenchall's traveling wagon. Here! I'm hoping somebody might buy it for me. I can't tell you who, but he is very powerful man. It's very pretty. Now let's get back to the book. It must be wonderful to have your own house. - You're so lucky! - It's not mine really. I'd want one of those low picket fences, children of course. I think he'd like children. He'd be a good father. Stern, but kinder than you'd think for superintendent. Captain Gunpowder. Oh, Jack! I have no doubt that if a man dies in scenery so... be cast down upon the river bank to look for nuggets. Prospecting? Never thought I's see the day. Yeah, since we seen Fuller Dandy I gets to thinking, Jack. It's gonna be gold. I mean, why else would that shifty bloke offer Miss Catherine 60 quid. Catherine? You saying Catherine owns this land? George left the place to Catherine and the school. She is the boss here now. - Who else knows about that, Captain? - Everyone. Think about it. People have been killing for this land. Jack! I'm as stupid as I look. Well, that is enough for today, I think. Ruby! You're doing very well. I'm so proud of you. I wanna be the best person I can be. Miss. Catherine! Jack, Jack! Bell? - Bell... - No, no. It was...it...we just found her. - Murderers! - No! - Murderers! - Go, go, hurry! - Murderer! Police! Murderer! Murderers! - No, you listen to me! - No ma'am, you can't go in there. - Mary, no! - No, I have to. I don't think it's a good idea. She must have come back in to fetch a book. - Get them out of here, Tom! - Stay out of here, ladies. And where were you? At Mr Harper, the lawyer wanted to sign some pap... God! You may take the body now Mr Reardon. Bury her in a pauper's grave. Mr Reardon. You'll bury her in a good plot by the willows. In your best casket. Send me your account. You know, if you'd given me Jack Keenan she'd be still alive, Mary. In consideration of the evidence the magistrate has declared Jack Keenan and his gang outlaws. This means that they can be shot on sight. But, any member of the gang alive or dead there is a reward of 40 pounds. Now, I know that many of you have in the past supported these criminals. But know that you can see their true nature. I would ask you and expect you to help me bring them to justice. Scones for the superintendent. Particularly attractive cleaning ladies we employ here. What exactly are you looking for? Ruby saw what was in here. That's why you killed her. Go ahead. That's Gloria. She conjected typhus. 3 months after we were married, I buried her. She looks a lot like you don't you think? This is not a game for women. Be careful, Emilia. How much further to Booth's camp? Ah, it's about a mile away. She said the bend in this river. Afternoon, Dan. - See, it's not real funny, Sid. - Don't meant to be, Dan. - You reach for your gun, and I'll shoot. - That's not... ...reasonable. Mrs Wiley. - Very sorry to hear about Cec. - If he owed you money, you're out of luck. He left me none. He didn't owe me money. In fact I was hoping a...might be able to get me some information actually. Do you think it's possible that...that Francis Fuller might have killed your husband? Cec said he had something for he'd kill for. Thought it was insurance. Cec always was dumb. What kind of insurance? You'll be safer without it. I can't read. My husband wasn't much of a man. But he was all I had. How much to let us go? - You have to pay more than 80 quid. - I'll pay you a 100. I'll have you know, my name's not actually Dan Sinclair. It's William Jameson. I'm a son of an earl. And I'll be a son of an ass if I believe that. - Did you have a pony growing up? - Of course I did. - And a wet nurse. - Two wet nurses? Let's knock it off Dan! Stay, stay, stay! Must be Jack. He is not that good of a shot. - Hold, hold, hold...gimme, gimme. - Easy, easy! We gonna need to get out of here. We need to go that way. On the count of three, you ready? One...two...three! Get on the horse mate! Come on! Damn it! Conrad will pay with his life for something Fuller did. But you didn't find anything. He must've already moved whatever it was. Ruby was hinting to me today that she hoped he'd marry her. - Poor Ruby. - If even so, I can't entertain that superintendent Fuller would... perhaps that was a picture of his dead wife. Maybe stumbled upon and she wasn't meant to. And 60 pounds for that farm? Frederick told there was gold in creek. We didn't find anything. What about the railway? Could I...see the papers on George's property? Would you have known if there'd be a line in the school? Yes, but um... Mr. Harper wanted me to sign some papers so I left... You think I was the target? In the event of the death of the appointed executor, - that's you -, prize should be disbursed to one of the estate. The commissioner of crown lands will become the executor. Who is the commissioner of crown lands? Father! Some people think Catherine was the target. Because of the land she inherited. A man offered her 60 pounds. That worthless piece of swamp? More money than sense she should take it. But if the railway went through it then the land would be worth... a lot more. But I decide where the railway goes. Yes. No one else have seen this. Hopetoun. Port Moore, little tree hill. The railway goes through here. George Jenkins' farm is down here. Nowhere near. Here's the surveyor's notes if you don't believe me. Of course, I do. I love you! And I love you. I know you believe Conrad to be some sort of criminal, but... he didn't do this. And nor did his friends. I think they were there to protect Catherine. I'm certain, that superintendent Fuller killed Ruby. This might surprise you, but... I share your misgivings about that man. Telling ya, it's the proof that Fife is after. The note says he wants Butler to get rid of old George. - This changes everything. - I'm telling ya, Fife will listen, Dan. Well they're murderers, Jack. Before you feel the blood on your hands over Ruby's corpse. You're right, Jack. I think it's about time to start looking at a new life fellas. We are outlaws now, we need to get out of here. - Where? - Shout America, I don't know. New Zealand, it's no snakes. Hopetoun is dead to us. Jack? We're done. Who gonna ask Miss Catherine to come with us? You back in town, you luckily get yourself killed. Gotta ask. We're gonna need some cash. Prop the traps see Captain is in the house. I go back to the shack. Dig up the stash. It's not gonna be nearly enough, mate. You might have to get the word out of Booth, trying to collect that coin. I'll go. Ruby never hurt anybody. Mick, you're right. I think we can be good for each other. You saying what I think you saying? Yes. I will marry you. Are you're mad?! They find you here, you'll swing. You know I didn't kill Ruby. I'll prove that Fuller is behind it. Mick can help. I don't trust Mick as far as I can throw him. I'm marrying him, Jack. - You don't love him. - You're wrong. I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get a message to Booth. And tell that him Jameson will be at the same place at 2 o'clock. It's the last thing I ask of you. I'll tell him. If they catch me... the last word on my lips will be your name. - Mr. Booth? - Good afternoon! - Finally we meet again. - Sorry about last time. I stopped to photograph the local fauna. And me watch stopped. Must've been your lucky day. I reckon someone was out to bushwach you. Oh, bullet hole in me teapot? I thought you might've done that. Me? I never damage silverware, mate. Oh, it's a dangerous place out here! Oh, this is my friend. Norman. How do you do, friend? I've got the required paperwork here, your signature please. You should carry a gun Mr. Booth? Tried to get you once, they might try again. I do. Who crosses this? You can drop your weapon, Norman. Get of your horse, and get on your knees, son. - Put your hands on your head. - Whatcha doing Booth? - Must be some kind of mistake. - No mistake. Pictures says a perfect match. You are William Jameson. And I'm here to kill you. Who is this lad? Ah, that is Miss Catherine's mare. I think we're all right. Yeah, I told ya. Ah, Miss Catherine. I was just coming to see you. I'm sorry. - Hold! - Drop your weapon! On your knees! Now! They say, this way you'd get a fair trial. Otherwise you'd just be hunted down, and shot. We're outlaws Miss Catherine. They don't need a trial. He knows that. He is quite correct. It's all right Miss Catherine. It's all right. Shackles! Were are Keenan and Sinclair? You can kill me, like you killed Old George. No! No, no! No! You promised me! Put the gun down! Put the gun away! Go to hell. - You promised! You got a promise me! - After you. Put it away! Please! Please! Please. Put it away. I think I know where they are. I found a stack of these in the shack. Now why would that be? Look. This man could be Sinclair's brother, don't you think? You tell me, genius. I'm having this lawyer fella tracked down even as we speak. When I find him... I'm gonna find them. Get them in the back of the wagon. It's a con. The whole thing is a con, you got the wrong man this is Dan Sinclair, it's not William Jameson. Then he won't have a scar on his skull. When the foil caught you, when you were thirteen, touch?. I'm sorry sir, but it seems the con is on you. Dan, son of a lord? I know. My father kicked me outta home when I was nineteen. Little problem with the vicar's wife. All these years we were riding together... You never said it, you didn't tell me. Ah, what difference does it gonna make, Jack? I came here to start new life, mate. I'm Dan Sinclair now. Or I was. - What're you doing? - My triumph requires a post mortem photograph as evidence. Then he finally decided that he wants me dead, has he? I beg your pardon, sir? - My father. - Oh, not your father sir, no. The angels spirited his soul away last october. Really? - Well, who is it then? - I'm sorry sir, professional discretion. Can you at least tell me, how much I'm worth? 50 pounds plus expenses. Hey, I'll give you 100 if you let us go. And then you...you take your photo... and then... I just pretend that I'm dead. Look. See? And then you collect the fee of both parties. That's a hundred and fifty quid all up. Hundred and fifty, you'd never have to work again. But I rather enjoy my work. In fact I booked for the Americas next. A job twice for your work. Would you like to go before or after this gentlemen? Come on, then. Just make it quick. Jack. Dan. Put your weapon down, sir! I'll give you my word. You'll get the reward: 80 pounds, two of them. Excuse me. He didn't do it! Tommy. Your reward Mr Booth as promised. They will be hanged, sunrise. - That's definite? - Absolutely. Would you be so kind as to send a post mortem photograph to this address? That'd be my pleasure. - Do you mind? - Of course. Goodbye, sir. I've been riding with a real life lord. Earl, actually. An earl. Don't take your eyes off them, Scanlon. Should've left town when you had the chance, Jack. Should have done a lot of things, Mick. I got this from Cec Wiley's widow. It's proof that Fuller is behind it all. Make sure you get it to Fife. I spoke to the wife, she confirmed what Keenan said. There is no signature of course. No need. I recognise the handwriting. Arrest the superintendent. You have your orders, lieutenant. And Keenan's gang, sir? The sentence has already been passed. But they're innocent that was proved in that note. It's proof that Fuller ordered Butler to deal with George Jenkins, that's all. It's a completely separate case, I mean... - Sir. - Scanlon, you may go. You can overturn it, father, you can. Emilia, the vital evidence is too strong. They were covered in blood, the body was still warm. No. I have told you Fuller killed her. He was seeing her. So are half the men in Hopetoun, Emilia. It's an open-and-shut case, the magistrate will not change his mind. No, they're having a hang at sunrise unless you do something. There is nothing I can do. I'm sorry. Fife has ordered me to arrest you. You're gonna be sent to Goulburn tomorrow. Arrest me? I have my orders, sir. And what did Fife offer you? Captain? - Only lieutenant? - Spoke to the widow, she's sworn on a Bible you payed Wiley. - For information. - Note doesn't lie! I was right about you, Scanlon. And I was always wrong about you, sir. Arrest him! Stop him! Make way! No! No! They call it the standing drop. New method from Old Blighty. Designed to snap the neck. Like that. 'Cause I've heard it doesn't always work first time. I've heard you can dangle there for hours. End up choking on your own spit. Or the force of the drop could snap your head clean off. Yeah, ok. Making jokes. They're only gonna kill us. Yeah, well. Death. Yearning. New adventure. Kinda like the old one there. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Hanging set for noon. Unfortunately I won't be there to see yous. Got urgent police business to take care of. We don't mind waiting. Pity you won't be around, Jack. Could've been my best man. Jack! Don't give it to him, mate. When I swing, Mick, I'll have one regret. Yeah, what's that? It's that I haven't put a shot going through your heart when I had a chance. But why would I bother? I had for your harm down I miss. I'll take good care of 'em, Jack. Mary and Tom won't want for nothing. I promise you that. Where is the girl? Where is the cash? Toss it down. Not until you give me Miss Fife. You get the Fife girl when you give me the money. Now, give me Emilia. Can't be noon already. All right, come easy. Make it easy on yourself. - Get out. - Get the hands off me you dog! - Get out. Where is everyone? Where is the hang man? Tell me this doesn't mean what I think it means. Steady men! On my call! We can't say we didn't see it coming. We've had fun while it lasted, eh? Was indeed, Dan, was indeed. I see you boys on the other side, ey? Or, if we see you first, Jack. - Come on you bastards, get over with. - Come on. Come on, boy. Come on! - Come on, boy! - Come on, shoot me! - Just strike down! - Shoot me! - Come on! - Shoot me! - You better pull. - Come on! Put the guns down! Frank Butler has my daughter. What? He kidnapped Emilia last night. Demanded a ransom. Well, so pay it! I did! I sent Scanlon out this morning with a group of his men. Butler took the money and killed them. He left this man alive. Dumped these poor souls on the wagon and bring them back to Hopetoun as a message. What sort of god forsaken message is this? Fuller, is the one behind all this. He is out for revenge. He wants my blood. The blood of this entire town. So, what's that got to do with us? I want my daughter back. You want us to get her? I'll give you a full pardon. The governor is my personal friend. I'll give you an amnesty on all your crimes. Your word ain't worth more than a bucket of spit. My signature is. Bring my daughter back to me alive and I sign it. You got yourself a deal. Undo their shackles. Except the farrier. What? - Why not? - He stays as insurance. - Like hell I'm staying. - We need all the muscle we can get. And I need to ensure you don't make a run to the border. - Jack! - We are not going out there without him! Then you all can stay here and die in the dirt. - Jack. - Jack. - Jack. - Jack. Conrad? - You boys better bring her back. - Oh, we promise. It's three men to the east, Jack. There is no sign of Emilia. There is Frank. Two to the west. There. There she is. There's only one way in or out. There is no way in without being seen. - So what's the plan then? - We kill them all. Yeah, or I suppose we could ask them nicely to kill themself for us? - Yeah, we're outgunned. We're gonna be smart about this. - It's masculine, Jack. It's masculine. You got something in mind? Yah, I'll walk up the front door ask Frank to let me in. - I think he's up. - He seriously is. Let's go. Jack Keenan. I'm here to see Frank. What makes you think, Frank wants to see you? Jed...hang on. What do you want? I got a deal to put down. The way I see it you and me are in this together. It's us against the law. We should combine forces. - That's your deal? - Yeah, that. And old Fife's gold. I know a case he stashed. Last time we met, Keenan you were trying to kill me. You were trying to kill me, Frank. That was just business, so is this. Grab his shooters. Mary, what's going on? First they cleared the streets now the boys have disappeared. And Fife is drinking in my pub. But he is not saying a word, no one is. - There are no traps in the barracks. - Because, they're all here getting drunk. Refill? So where is Mick Scanlon? I hear he rode out this morning. Oi! All right, you lot are better to skip it. Clear out! - Hey, we haven't even warmed up. - What will your senior sergeant say when he sees in this state? I don't think we have to worry about that. And we ain't no traps no more. They get paid nothing to take on butler, do we, lads? Heading south to the gold field. Let's try to get rich. And this joker he comes out of nowhere on his big bloody horse and he goes to put some lead right between my eyes... and his gun jams. And you wanna join this gang? You gotta know who's number one. You're the boss, Frank. You killed a few of my men Jackie boy. Well, like I said that was just business, wasn't it? Just making money, like you. Fair enough. And I tell you what, it must be some gold out there on Old East Road. A lot of farmers have been killed for their land. Between you and me I would have done it for nothing. There's nothing quite like a man or a woman dying at your feet. The look in their eyes. Fear. Knowing that their express's gonna be their last. Like the Ryan family? You remember them? Shawn Ryan? Wife, daughter, little boy? Yeah, that one. That was a sweet kill. I need to take a slash. Get out! He got Headly's grog. Emilia, it's me Jack. Gonna get you out of here. Seems you forgot who is the boss, Jackie boy. Try join the gang? - Give it to him, Frank. - Eh? I know it, boss gold he say. I mean, it's us against the law. That's it Frank! Did Fife pay to come and get his daughter? Or did you cut a deal? Save the girl, dodge the rope, huh? I don't know what you're talking about. I came for him. You came for this dog? You expect me to believe that you came to save the life of a dirty, filthy trap? Not to save him. To kill him. Why? Why do you want to kill him? Stop him stealing my woman. Gimme his gun. Now Keenan time for you to put up or die. Do it. Do him. Get him up. Fellas, if Jack doesn't shoot the trap...shoot Jack. - Jack! - Shut up! I warned you to know Mick, I said that I'm wrong for your heart. Do him Keenan. Yeah, that is how you shoot a trap! Oh, very fancy, Jack. And what are you doing? Only had one piece of lead, mate. There you're right. But my mates they got heaps. - Drop it, drop it! - All the guns down the drop. - Put them in the drop. - Put them down! Put them down! - Do it! - Do what he says, now! Quick, hurry up! Where is the girl? Where is the girl? Where is she, Frank? They took her out the backway. Couple hours ago. You know where? I have heard him. Dan, get Mick on his horse. Cap, cover me. Cap, come on, let's go. Round up the horses! Get the guns from inside. We're going after them, Frank? I forget them, we got bigger fish to fry. Where did they take her? You shot me you bastard. - I shot you in the shoulder. - Yeah, you call this me shoulder? Had to buy the boys some time, you know. Aimed at me heart you barely missed. - Where is Emilia? - Taking her to Chao Fat. - Why did they take her, Mick? - I don't know, to keep her safe. In case the likes of you turned up. See you back at Hopetoun, Mick, get patched up. - Have you believed... - I'm coming with ya. - You'd just slow us down. - Hell I will, I'm still the law. Conrad. How much friends want for her? Don't get any ideas, Chao Fat. She is Frank's tabby now. Emilia. Conrad. Emilia, it's me. It's all right, it's all right. Everything is gonna be all right. Where are you going? You can't just quit the town! Watch us! No law in Hopetoun. Hurry up! You fellas aren't welcome here. - Says who? - I do. I own the pub. Not anymore. You...belong to me. I used to outfight and fall off that horse. - That's bad luck. - I'll be all right. You worry about yourself, old man. Too late, Emilia's gone. - Says Fuller took her. - Fuller? A couple of diggers recognised him. I should have shot him, when I had the chance. - So, where did he took her, Jack? - Took off down the western road about an hour ago, Cap. - That was too far, Jack. - Could be anywhere by now. We're not gonna find her by talking about it, are we, boys? We'll make camp here for the night. Are you cold? I'll get us some firewood. Let me go! Let me go! Go where? Into the arms of your farrier? Or perhaps you'd like to go home to daddy. It's all right, Emilia. I know everything. Your father hired the Butlers. The Butlers killed all those farmers on the Old East Road - and they murdered Ruby. - No, you murdered Ruby. Did I? For what reason? - You were working for my father too. - Is that why he ordered my arrest? How could he do this? For the land, obviously. And all the money that he'd make when he sells it to the railway. I'm sorry, Emilia. You saved me from the Butlers. Why? You've been shot. Nah, the lead just grazed me. Here. I misjudged you. I'm sorry. You know you really are a very beautiful woman, Emilia. So was your wife. It's incredible how much you look like her. - I'm sorry. - No. No, I'm sorry. Let her go! Let her go! - Get away from her. - Well, well, well. Look what the wind dragged in. Three dead men. Three dead men with guns. Come away from him, Emilia. - No. - What do you mean no? Everyone enough! Put your guns down! Emilia, Fuller is with the Butler gang. They killed the Ryans. Old George, Ruby, he kidnapped you. He rescued me. He is not the man we're after. Jack? Come on, Mary. Give it up. In a pub full of whores I'm not a big fan is playing hard to get. Not here, Frank. Why don't we... go up to my room? You don't strike me as the shy type, Mary. Some things I'd rather do in private. Let's go. Why don't I get us a bottle of the good stuff? Killing should be done in private too. - Hey, let go of my mom! - Tom, get out of here! Tom! - Tough little maggot, ain't ya? - Get your hands of my son! What are you gonna give me if I let him go? I'll play nice. Get out of here, kid. Tommy, I want you to go Catherine's house, okay? - I want to stay with you. - No, no. I need you to look after Catherine. Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I promise. I promise ya. Come here. I love you, okay? Okay, go, go! Tom Barrett, you do as I say! So, you're gonna play nice, Mary? I'll keep you for later. Keep an eye on her! Live it up, fellas! This town now belongs to us! Run by Butler rules! The booze is free and so are the women! Getting somewhere? You, what do you want? We just came to collect our pardon. And the 400 pounds. I promised you the money and my signature on the condition you returned my daughter to me. Emilia! Thank God! I know what you've done! What have I done? You hired the Butlers to clear the land and make your fortune selling it to the railway. No, no no! It's not tue. I...I didn't... I didn't... expect it to go so bad. I swear to you on your mother soul, yes I wanted them off the land, but it was Butler... - he was out of control... - Frank Butler was doing exactly what you were telling him to do. What, you'd think I told him to abduct my own daughter? What do you reckon, Jack? - I wouldn't put it past him. - Why'd he do it, why'd he take her? Greed, why else? He might not a little bit of bad that far. Ah, spare me. Emilia, we have to go. No. - Get on the wagon. - No. James Fife! You're under arrest for conspiracy to murder. Francis! You all right? It's over! - No, it's not. - Yes it is. It's not over. The Butlers, they're in Hopetoun. They've taken over the pub. Wake up, wake up! Get up! Had your fun now it's time to work. Gimme some rum! Gimme some rum! Food to the boys. All right boys, first we gonna eat and after that, we burn this town to the ground. Frank Butler! Boys, boys! What is it with you, Jack? Like a bad smell. Like a piece of dung on my boot I can't get rid of. I give you one last chance, Frank. Grab your gang you man up. You ride out Hopetoun for good. Here is the thing. I like it here. I like the people. Especially that... Mary. Recon she's sweet on me, huh? - Kill him. - Guns down, boys! Or not! Either way, you are under arrest, Butler! You and your men. Boys... Got some killing out here to do. Get your asses out here! Jack! Go upstairs, go! Dan, upstairs! On the roof! Dan, keep them busy! Go go go! Oh, that was pretty silly. - Nice dive, though. - Yeah. - Can you walk? -Yeah. - Let's go! Catherine! - Jack! - Stay down, stay down! Frederick, you hurt? A bit of led poison. - Oh no, my mum! - That's OK. I'm gonna get her now. And you boys look after the young lady, will you? Oh, we certainly will, Jack. Dan! - What are we doing here, again? - What does it look like? We saving the town. It's the same town who thinks we are murders, scum, liars, - dogs, cheats. - And I'd thinks so, are we? - That's, lead Jack. - You know what? I think I need to get to the pub. - Drink. - Mary. - Ah. - But I suppose you wanna draw on my life on me again, do you? - See you on the other side. - See you on the other side. You ready? Yep. On three? Three! - Oh, it's very fancy, Frank. - You want it, Jack? Huh? You just met him. Come on. Hey Edwards. Thought you boys could use the farrier. Here is the deal... I get my horse... I ride out of town... I've done seek vengeance. You got no beef with me I got no beef with you. Both our interest should just walk away. I'm afraid I can't agree in that deal, Frank. Well, one of us will have to die. You said yourself this is just business. Why do you wanna make it personal for? Because it is personal, Frank. You just don't know it. Remember your brother, Joey? I was the man who killed him. I'll wait for you outside. Jack, please. You don't have to do this. You're not the law. This isn't your responsibility. Jack, just leave it, let someone else to deal with Frank Butler! Mary, there is no one else. I'm gonna finish him. Jack! - You don't have to go. - He is still my father. I'll be waiting. Good. I'll return to Hopetoun in three days. If I find either of you here when I get back... go terrorise Victoria. Your time in my town is over. I'm sorry, I had to shoot you, Mick. - Take care of yourself, Jack. - Take care. Bye. Good bye, Jack. Sad I'm gonna stay. Go back to my old job. Once a farrier, always a farrier, huh? Keep an eye on the old fella, will ya? I think he's found someone to look after him already. It's been nice riding with you Conrad. You too, Jack. Well, if we ever need a horseshoe we know where to come. - Jack! - Hey. Hey listen, you make sure you look after your mom for me, all right? OK. Ready? Yeah. It's big country out there, Dan. Yeah. Which way are we heading? - West, I recon. - Yeah. Yeah, head to west is nice. Sun's always shining, the skies are always blue. Women have their own teeth. Let's do it. Free west, here we come!
