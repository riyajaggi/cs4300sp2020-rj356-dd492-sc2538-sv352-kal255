 Get out of my way. Everything I've got is in this pub. Give me a bucket. Get more water. Go! You're not going to do this now, are you, Mick? You should have stayed gone, Jack! Tommy? - Where's Tommy? - Mick? I'm going. Let me go. Tommy? Tommy! Mary! Get me some water! Tommy! Keep it coming!

 Need water! My ankle! My ankle! Goldy! Thank you. Where's Jack? He's gone. - You alright? - Yeah. Quick. Get some water. How are we going to fix it, Mom? Don't worry Tom, the bank will help us. - Superintendent. - Mary. - A little bit of trouble. - More than a bit. Can I expect you'll catch the culprit before he strikes again? You'll have to speak to Scanlon about that. As for your expectations... You should probably keep those to yourself. - If you're not here to investigate... - I'm here about the rumors. - What rumors? - That Keenan was here last night. - You know anything about him? - I didn't see him. Too much smoke. I'll tell you what. When you remember seeing him, and you tell me where he might be found, I'll find your fire starter. Mr. Winston. I've come to ask for an extension to my loan with the bank. You're aware of what happened to my establishment. Please, step inside. Now... What the hell are you playing at? Only that... in knowing what happened to the pub, you'd be aware that it's in need of repair and financial attention. I'm aware of no such thing, nor I care about the problems of whores or their madams. I'm sorry you were inconvenienced last night. Inconvenienced? I could have been killed. And you expect me to reward you for the experience? I'm already paying twice the interest a man would pay. A bit of a bump in the tally surely, within your interest... Is that a threat? - What? No. - You think you can come into my bank, and blackmail me...? I'm sorry. It's not what I'm doing. It's my livelihood. If it's not running, I can't make my loan repayments, I don't even know if I can keep the roof above our heads. Please. Domestic affairs are no concern to me. Request denied. Ace for grace. Jack, get back. Someone looks unhappy. I am unhappy. I just saw Mary and when I tell you what happened, you will be too. Which is why we're robbing the bank. And how are we going to do that? I haven't found yet. I know. We get a trunk big enough for one of you to fit in. And we drill some breathing holes for air. We deposit the trunk and the bushranger in the bank for safekeeping. That night, you jump out, you fill the trunk full of gold, you walk out the front door. - Free and rich. - Or he dies from lack of air. - Poor and interned. - Are you deaf? - Did you not hear, I said breathing holes. - Breathing holes. I'm not getting in the trunk because it's a stupid idea. I did say breathing holes. Say breathing holes one more time and I'm gonna shoot you in the face. Breathing holes. Go on. You shoot the bag, we all go up. Too low. Get up there. We'll knock on the door and ask for it. These are loaded so let's keep the stupidity to a minimum. - What do you want? - Who is it, dear? Don't... Scream. Tie him up. It's alright. Dan? Let's try that again. I recognise you. You used to be a farrier. Your name's Conrad, isn't it? There is no money in the bank. There's no money in the bank. Boom. I agree with Dan. Captain? Balls are good enough for you to use, but a more civilized man might say that he's a no good sniveling liar. Civilized. My husband's telling the truth, he's a good man... Shut up, woman! They don't believe me, why on earth would they listen to you. A real charmer, aren't you? - Conrad, what do you think? - I don't believe him. I'm not a liar. There is no money, no gold, nothing in that vault. If you don't believe me, check in the ledgers on the table. I'm not lying. Funnily enough, I've heard that one before. Now get up. We're going for a walk. It's empty. I can see that it's empty, thank you, Conrad. The carriage will be coming in tomorrow morning. There is no money here. That's right. You've heard that one before. Shut up! What was your name again? Victoria. Like the Queen. Yes. Might I say, what a suitably apt name for such a handsome woman. Thank you. That's very sweet. And might I add, you are quite a handsome man yourself. Handsome, your mask. Thank you, Victoria. I might just stretch my legs. See anything interesting out there? There's nothing but night out there, Victoria. So I should feel insulted then? Why is that? Seeing as there's nothing to tickle your fancy out there, but even less... it seems in here. I wouldn't actually be so hard on myself, if I were you. I'm sure you get a fair manner and attention from the civilized will to do tops in town. Yes, it's very exciting to be... leered upon by boring men of commerce. Lucky husband. My husband's interests lie elsewhere. I'd have to say that he's an idiot. And your interests? Mine? Do they lie elsewhere? Or... do you like what you see? Jack. Listen. - Maybe it's time to call it a day. - Nope. Before anything else goes wrong. Not to give you occasion to pull the trigger, but is it absolutely necessary to hold that gun on me? We're going to wait. Until the money's in the bank, we'll take it once the carriage is gone. All we have to do is sit tight until tomorrow. Here? His place. It'd be more comfy, wouldn't it. You really are a handsome devil, you know that? I'm clear on that, it's just nice to hear confirmation. Why don't you close your eyes? Ok. I'm full of yours. Let me help you. Let me help you. Got that. Got that. I didn't see that coming. Why did you stop? You could have saved us. What were you possibly thinking? It's not sore, is it? But it would be a little bit better if I had some alcohol, Jack. - Got any booze? - Yes, of course. - Make them dinner while you're at it. - The key's gone. - Don't you got another one? - I had one somewhere. We did, until the imbecile lost it. I would appreciate if you would stop - talking to Victoria like that. - Little man, big gun. Jack, I'm gonna shot him. Captain! That's fancy. Cheers. Time to change your bandages. That's alright, I got it. I am partially to blame for your predicament. Partially, you reckon. Why didn't you run to those traps? - I don't know. - You could have got away. Maybe I didn't want to contend myself to another ten years of married bliss. And now that you're here. Now that I'm here? Get out whore. Mom? Tommy, get back to your bedroom. Go. You alright? I'll take care of this. Come on. It wasn't my pig. What difference does it make? If it was, I could charge them with malicious damage or theft. - But? - As it wasn't, littering is all I can charge the culprit with. This isn't about improper dumping of garbage this is about someone in town out to get me and my business. I agree. Which is why you need to let me do my job. Keep Tommy close. I'll take care of it. Okay. They should call this game drive me batty. If you're playing patience, how are you expected to get patience from playing patience? It's called patience. You trust him? I don't. Just because he's a coward who runs from a burning building doesn't mean he's lying about when the carriage is due. Even if he isn't lying. Doesn't mean that we take his word for face value, either. I mean, look at him. Ugly mug like that. - I'm sitting right here. - Shut up. Jack! I can't stay here anymore. I can't. I gotta get out of this house. Conrad! Let me take the boy to the bush highway. See if we can confirm the coach story. Why don't we just take the carriage? Daniel. There's four of us. Look, this is different. They have heavily armed troopers on those gold carriages. Six or more, armed to the teeth, with guns they know how to use. What's the plan, then? I just told you. I'm listening. I didn't even hear a plan. You're a civilized young man, who got caught up with the wrong crowd. You set me free, and I'll see to it you have a steady financial future. Keep your mouth shut. Alright, enough! Captain, take Conrad out and check on the carriage. See what's what. Report back. Let's go Conrad. Find something to do, so we can get away from these people. - What are you smiling at, bank boy? - I'm quiet as a church mouse. You better keep it that way, we got company, Scanlon. - Get him to the bedroom. - It won't work. He was supposed to come today. Questions will be asked, and suspicions will be raised. Dan? You can trust her, Jack. You get rid of him, and you smile. Alright? Madam! Good morning. I wasn't sure anyone was home. Hence the vigorousness of your knocking, so early on Sunday morning. - How can I help you, sergeant? - I need to speak with your husband. About? There was a fire at the Commercial across the way. Your husband was seen there on the night. I need to speak with him to get his account of what happened. I see. What was that? The cat. I'm afraid, Sergeant, my husband has taken ill overnight and is confined to his bed. But I'll be sure to pass on your message as soon as he is up and about. I'd appreciate it. - Sorry for the early knocking. - That's quite alright. Is there something you want to tell me? There's... A loose thread on your collar. Got it. - Good day, Sergeant. - Good day. That's that carriage. That's just our luck. Looks like the wheel's broken. Bloody Christmas. What? It'll be Christmas before they get it fixed. Come on, let's go. Come on. Where're you going? Conrad? Come back here, boy. Get here! Come here! You were pushing them too hard. I told you that. Corporates! Here's your chance to say something not to get us killed. Off your horses. - Easy! - I got it! I got it! Your gun! There it is. Over there! State your business or meet your maker. We just wanted to take a look at that wheel. For the thought you might be able to use a hand. You're too busy to deal with this. Luckily, - I'm a farrier. - A farrier Can you fix a wheel? Yeah. Why didn't you say so? We'll need to get the weight off this coach before we can get started. Over there. You heard him, you lazy sods, get in here and unload. Why don't you pace some more, it's doing wonders for your mood. It's not a very good plan of yours, Jack. If I'm honest with you. Not sure that's required, if I'm honest with you, Dan. Where are they? When I kill a man, I like him to stay dead. - Where are you going? - Joey Butler is walking free. I thought he was in trial. - Continue with the plan, I'll be back. - When? Joey! Come on! I say we take'em. You're crazy. Come on. Most of them ain't greater than you. We capture the boss, the rest will follow on the sheep. You're out of your mind. Let's fix this wheel, get them on their way. What are you afraid of Conrad? Get me that mallet, will you? Mallet. Back to work. Capture the leader, did you? Shut up, fix the wheel. Joey! Joey! You like to hide like the gutless coward you are. You should have hang. Haven't you heard? They let me go. I'm innocent. You tell that to the family you murdered. I'd love to. But they're already dead. And with flames, it was burnt. You want me to rough him up a bit? - Get him to move on. - Yes. But don't. You just say the word, alright? Cause I really won't mind doing that. - Superintendent. - Mary. Scanlon tells me you're unhappy about the progress with your case. Can you blame me? I've got a mess on my hands, death threats on my doorstep. Wouldn't you be unhappy if nothing was done to find the culprit, and the key suspect was yelling outside your door? The signs have come down from the Heaven... - Him? - He was there the night of the fire. Was he? Just like Keenan. If you'll excuse me. Did you see Keenan here on the night of the fire? Lot of people that night. You're being clever with me, boy? No, I was... "I was, I was just..." Just what? I work for Mary. So whoever she saw that night I did too. Loyalty. That's impressive. She must be paying you a small fortune if you'll risk so much. What's the point in being in a gang, if the gang leaves. I'm sure they'll be back soon. I don't know what he's thinking, Joey Butler. Where is the sense in it. There's no sense in it. I could do with a rum and a lie down. I've got some more rum in the kitchen. Rum. Have you killed him? I can only hope. Victoria. This is our chance. We can start a new life, both of us. Yeah. I'm for striking while the iron's hot, but he could die. I feel bad about that, I really feel bad, but he brought it upon himself, and what's more,it's been a long time coming. I still think that we should take him to see a doctor. Get a quick to come round and see him here. You do not want to run away with me. I just think if you're serious about running away, you're gonna need a stake. and I can't argue that he's a clown. He's just a clown with access to a lot of cash. Right. I understand. - I'm going to get the doctor. - Yeah. - Poker fell on him, you say? - Yes. Right off the mantel. It was a... - a terrible, unforeseen accident. - I bet it was. I came to see this man about a loan for some medical equipment. Turned me down. Poor risk, apparently. So personally, I wouldn't blame the poker if it decided to fall on him a few times. Is he gonna live, doc? Hard to say. But if he does come to, he'll have a beauty of a headache. If there nothing more you can do? We really do need him up and about. There is one thing. - What's he doing? - Smelling salts. Bushrangers. He's obviously delirious. Obviously. Obviously, yes. Frederick. You off to church? Yes, I... Where else we'll be going on a Sunday? Right, Conrad? Right. - Except for the... - The business. The business we have to do first. - Business on a Sunday? - Church business. - About the... - Piano. The church piano, I'm buying the church piano. Piano business. I should have known you'd do something so selfless. Shall I save your seat when you're finished. If you'd care to sit with me. I'd care to. Right... - Business first. - Of course. Either you're dumb as dirt or too ballsy for your own good, coming back into town like this. - Either way, I'm taking you in today. - Same way you took Joey Butler in? You said he'd hang, Mick. - Wasn't enough evidence to convict. - How about a dead family, lead in me? You think I didn't want to see that bastard hanged? How much did he pay you, Mick? How much does it cost to bribe Sgt Mick Scanlon? I wouldn't have put it past you, if reliable what Mary says. You really think Mary's gonna marry you? Thank you, doctor. Thanks, doc. We need to get him to the bank right now. He can't authorize the delivery, he won't understand your threats, let alone have the capacity to follow orders. Okay. Can you get me some of his clothes? Anything that says bank. Right. I'm a good banker. I'm a very good banker. A very good banker. Don't try me. Are you gonna be able to keep your mouth shut, long enough for non of us get shot, eh? If I must. - Oh,cheech. - I get it. - Dan. Showtime. You boys took your time. We were delayed. - Who are you, if you don't mind? - I'm the assistant bank manager here. It's Mr Winston that you've come to see. - Are you alright, sir? - He's fine. - Aren't you, dear? - Yes, I'm fine. He is fine. He is fine. He had a few with his lunch, he's bound to a good stiff one. - Aren't we all? - You said it. Anyway, if he can make his mark on these documents, we can start unloading. That's it. That's down there. Good enough. Start unloading, boys. - The safe keys. - I didn't give him... Good day. Good day. We'll see you on the next one. Troopers! Ride out! Would you look at that. Talk about the perfect crime. When Jack... Oh, come on. It's the stupidest plan. The stupidest plan, Jack. - You got the money, let's go. - No, I don't. Where's the money? - It's in the safe. - Get the key. There is no key, because the key left town. - No key? - There's no key. Where's Jack? What? What? I got explosives, let's just blow the thing. - Yeah. That is a good idea. - Really? Really? When they put the noose round our necks, you be sure to ask the traps how they found us. So, I use explosives? Boys. Always carry a spare. Right, dear? And spare ledgers too, for cooking the books. I always wondered how you managed to pay your women. It takes its time. Happy Christmas. - You won't get away with this. - Yes, he will. Or everyone will know about your taste for embezzling. Touch your pistols, and she dies. Nice to do the hard work for me. Now... Just hand over that cash. Nice... and easy. There's plenty for all of us. Not need for gunfight. I'm not the sharing type. Are you? We've worked so hard for this. Tell it to the angels. Where is at? Don't ask. - Who did this? - Bushrangers. There was a hold-up. Followed by a gunfight. - Did you recognised them? - No, we didn't. Did we, dear? No, we didn't. Get him out of here. Not that I'm anything but grateful, I don't wanna know where this came from, do I? Probably not, no. And because I'm in need right now, doesn't mean I'm a charity case. Yeah, I know that. What is it? What's wrong? It's nothing a good night sleep won't fix. I'll see you later. Goodnight. Goodnight. Once a rummy, always a rummy. We both know you saw something. So why don't you tell me what it was you saw? Hold. Next time you firebomb your work place, make sure there are no witnesses. - I can explain. - Please don't. It's not interesting. You thought you could scare the woman away and buy a pub for peanuts, I know. Nothing happens here without me knowing about it. You understand? And from now on, your eyes... and your ears, they're mine too. You won't have any more trouble as far as your pub's concerned. You caught the culprit? It was Joey Butler. God rests his soul. - Here's to my successful plan. - Yours? Without me to change the wheel, the money would still be out there. I still think we could have taken them. It's better him, than me, Jack. Here's to Joey Butler. I for one, I'm glad he's dead. - Joey Butler! - Joey Butler! Joey! Frank! Bad news. About Joey. What's my little brother got himself into now? He's been killed. By who? I don't know. Best you find that out, then. Subtitle: Wild Fangirl Upgraded: Szaki Thanks the help for LaDa.
