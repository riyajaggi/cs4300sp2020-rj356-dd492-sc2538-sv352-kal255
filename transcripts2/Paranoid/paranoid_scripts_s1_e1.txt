 Paranoid (2016–…): Season 1, Episode 1 - Episode #1.1 - full transcript 
 Detectives Nina Suresh, Bobby Day and Alec Wayfield investigate when family doctor Angela Benton is murdered in a children's playground. The apparent killer, schizophrenic Jacob Appley, is later found dead but Alec disbelieves Doctor Crowley's view that it was suicide. Ageing, ailing Bobby befriends Lucy Cannonbury, a witness and friend of the victim, whilst Nina, dumped by boyfriend Dennis, turns to Alec. The detectives get wind of a bogus policeman, Galen, of whom there is no official record, and whom they name the Ghost Detective before a postcard arrives at the police station, saying Look At Angela's Past. This leads to Dusseldorf, home of Angela's ex-partner Ruben Lucana, and detective Linda Felber, who finds a dead man at Ruben's house. Then another card arrives for Bobby with the words You Have No Idea What You Are Up Against.

 (SCREAMING CONTINUES)
 (DISTORTED WHISPERS AND VOICES)
 Look at him. That's not a haircut.
That's a hairSTYLE.
 How much do you pay for that, Alec?
Leave him alone, Nina.
 Did you go to Manchester
for that haircut?
 He had bloody pomegranate
with his chicken last week!
 I'll bet it was organic. Was it?
I tell you what...
 That looks like an organic haircut
to me. (CHUCKLES)
 Oh, thou halfpenny purse of wit.
 He just quoted Shakespeare at me!
 Well, I'm making a complaint.
I'm going to HR.
 I'll be back in a minute.
 When are you gonna get your bladder
looked at, Bobby? Bob!
 Happens to men of a certain age.
 They have tablets for it, you know.
 (BREATHES HEAVILY)
 (DOOR OPENS)
 MAN: Oh, that walking headache
of a commander,
 that man's the bane of my life.
 He's parked in my space again.
 Boss, can I just check something
with you?
 Shakespeare in the workplace.
There's a directive against that,
 isn't there?
Intellectual harassment?
 It's bordering on hate crime (!)
No work to do today, Nina?
 (PHONES RING)
 CID.
 (CHILD CRIES)
 Why don't they take their kids home?
What's the matter with people?
 They've never seen a murder before,
Bobby.
 OK. Angela Benton.
 Child with her, boy.
 Three years old.
 (EXHALES SHARPLY)
 It was a man. Hoodie.
 Weird head jerking.
 Stabbed, ran.
 No face. Weird is 'ei' -
you've spelled it 'ie'.
 That's 'wierd'.
Is it 'weird' or 'wierd'?
 Weird.
 OK, 22 witnesses.
22 witnesses and no-one saw a face?
 Shock can do that. Fear can do that.
 OK, she's a GP. One of
the other mums knew her a bit,
 but was it a random attack
or was he looking for her?
 Was it a patient at her practice?
 We have a Lucy Cannonbury.
Where is she?
 Lucy Cannonbury.
Picked the child up,
 took him out of the way.
 OK, let's start with her. Bobby?
 Yeah, all right.
 Er... It was about 8:50.
The park gets quite crowded then
 because the mums have dropped off
their school-age kids
 and they bring their toddlers here
on the way home.
 They... They bring coffee and sit.
 I worry about that -
that they have to drink coffee.
 You worry about the coffee.
Well, I have a cafe.
 I see how much coffee
people drink these days.
 Angela came in sometimes.
 Can we get back to this morning?
 He was about 15 steps
from the climbing frame
 and he just lurched.
 He stumbled, fell over...
 ..as he ran off.
 Miss Cannonbury,
that's all very detailed. Erm...
 8:50, 15 steps.
 Have you got, like,
some memory thing or something?
 Er... No. Not memory.
I like to be present.
 Present.
Yes.
 Erm... Why...
Why did no-one see his face?
 He had his head down, like this.
 And...erm... And you didn't
have a child with you.
 No, I live nearby. Plant Planet.
 I come here to read.
 I like the sound of the children.
 I don't have kids. Do you?
 Kids, me? (SCOFFS)
 Are you OK?
Yeah, yeah.
 What do you mean?
Breathe.
 You what?
Take some deep breaths.
 So, er...
 (CLEARS THROAT) 8:50, 15 steps.
 My sister's husband
started having panic attacks.
 I invited him to the meetings,
but he wouldn't have it.
 He'd rather take pills.
 I never said
I was having panic attacks.
 I never said that you did say, so...
 What meetings were these?
The Friends. Quaker meetings.
 Would you like to come along?
No.
 A woman was killed right here.
 Erm...
Her little son watched it happen.
 I know.
 I held him.
 (HEAVY BREATHING)
 You hear it on the radio
all the time.
 Social Services are told
time and time again
 these people are left to run wild
and...
 Your daughter lived with you?
 I could help out with Luke
when she was at work.
 They'll take him away from me,
won't they?
 They'll take Luke away.
 I mustn't go to bits.
 What about Luke's dad?
 He lives abroad.
 He's not English.
 He's not a man.
 We will have to let him know
what's happened.
 He can't have Luke. (SOBS)
 Do you want five minutes?
 No more questions.
 Just sit here with me.
 Oh, sorry.
 Excuse me. I... I'm...
 I'm sorry.
 (BREATHES DEEPLY)
 It's horrible.
 Don't think I don't know.
 We're looking right now,
I promise you.
 Checking out men
released into the community.
 But I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't ask you -
 was there anything?
 Something happened to Angela lately,
something she was frightened of?
 Some...man at the surgery?
 Anything.
 Nothing.
 What's that in the kitchen,
Mr Benton?
 The... The burn marks on the wall.
 (SOBS)
 What? What is it?
 We just kept saying
how lucky she was.
 There was a gas explosion
 and Angela was in the garden
with Luke.
 We just kept saying
how blessed she was to be alive.
 How can that be fair?
 Why d'you have to mention
the kitchen fire?
 I'd only just got the bloke
calmed down.
 Oi, Shakespeare.
Do you know what 'softly softly' is?
 Leave him alone, Nina.
 When did you get the job
as his chauffeur?
 What's wrong with being nice, eh?
 He came in this way.
We had a sighting on Myrtle Road
 which suggests that he may have
come down from Hunstan Flats area.
 Witness descriptions -
he wasn't right.
 (PHONE RINGS)
Head jerking.
 What is it, boss? Yeah.
 You see something, Bobby?
 NINA: Yeah, OK.
 We have a name.
 His brother called in,
said he's gone missing.
 Psychopathic schizophrenia with OCD.
Try this.
 He lives up on Meadow Lake Lane.
Hunstan Flats.
 Jacob Appley.
There's someone out there.
 Watching us.
 Bobby, we're police officers
at a murder scene.
 People are gonna look at us.
 I can put up with your mood swings,
but don't you go paranoid on me, OK?
 Come on.
 Why do I have to live next door
to a psycho?!
 Why wasn't he locked up?!
Psychos with rights!
 You're not going anywhere.
See what happens, eh? D'you see?
 Hey, hey, hey,
back in your flat now.
 I'm just looking for my brother.
I'm looking for Jacob.
 What's your name?
Henry. Henry Appley.
 (STRAINS)
 Your brother ever wear a hoodie,
Henry?
 He'd talk to himself
 and then he'd see people
looking at him.
 Hoodie was his way of hiding.
 Did Jacob ever refuse
to take his medication?
 Never. He wanted to take them.
 What's this about?
Ah, that was a trick
 that we came up with.
 If he kept his bottles
in his slippers,
 then every morning he'd have them
in his hand first thing.
 So sometimes he might forget
to take them, is that it?
 But we had it sorted.
 Erm... Did... Did Jacob do these?
 My brother had this thing
about drawing himself.
 He did a picture every day.
 D'you mind if we take this?
No.
 Where would Jacob go, Henry?
 Who does he know? What does he like?
 BOSS: No sightings of Jacob Appley.
 No-one who knows him
has seen anything of him.
 If he's not on his meds, he's not
gonna be any more sane or rational.
 Keep ramping up the message -
 this man is dangerous,
do not approach him.
 I think everybody and his dog
knows that, boss.
 Things are bad, Nina. It's my job
to stop them getting worse.
 Now we've got the name of Jacob's
psychiatrist, a Doctor Crowley.
 Alec, go and see him.
BOBBY: Jacob doesn't drive,
 but we scoured the town
and he hasn't turned up.
 If he's out in the countryside
somewhere,
 how far can he get?
Let's move this search out.
 We've got officers coming in
from Cuddington and Waverton.
 Listen up. There's a mood out there
and there's a mood upstairs as well.
 The kind of suspect we have.
 The woman who was killed.
The place it happened.
 Mothers and toddlers.
 We do not balls this up.
 Right? Got that?
 (SIGHS) It's Dennis's dad's
retirement party tonight.
 His family are big on family.
 I'm gonna have to go over there
for five minutes to show my face.
 Alexander.
Doctor Crowley.
 I need to talk to you
about Jacob Appley.
 You're a detective now.
No, your mother told me.
 I... I bumped into her in town.
Jacob Appley?
 I believe you're his psychiatrist?
 I... I've had a few glasses of wine.
 I didn't know anyone would want
to speak to me about this tonight.
 I just want some information, OK,
 about his medication,
his condition, his moods.
 Has Jacob ever been known
to be violent before?
 Some psychopathic tendencies, but...
 Look, the...the drugs don't
necessarily stop the thoughts.
 They just wipe out...
They lessen the inclination to act.
 It's not fair.
Not fair?
 To turn up like this. I was asleep.
What are we supposed to do?
 The tests aren't definitive.
Nothing is in psychiatry.
 You have to use your judgement.
They'll think it was me.
 I signed the release.
They'll say it was my fault!
 Doctor Crowley,
this man is dangerous
 and he's out there tonight.
We need your help to find him.
 No-one's interested
in whether it's your fault.
 Just yet.
 Oh, no, no.
 Ah, no.
I'm not on duty and I'm not sober.
 I will speak to you when
I can properly represent myself.
 Look, I can't stay.
I'll just give your dad a kiss.
 Is your mother scowling?
 No, I told 'em you weren't coming.
Oh, God.
 It's not like I spend my day
selling time shares.
 Someone was killed today.
Let's go in.
 Nina.
 I told 'em that we were finished.
 Stop it.
 Is there any food left?
I haven't eaten all day.
 Look, please don't make a scene,
Nina.
 Dennis. I'm late.
 It's all over the news.
Your job isn't the problem.
 But I bought a dress. You...
 You let me buy a dress. I...
I broke my neck to get here.
 I just knew tonight
that I had to tell you.
 Tell me? Like, w...
 You've known for a while?
 Yeah.
 How long?
 Doesn't matter.
It matters!
 I'm 38. We've been together forever.
 Four years.
Four and a half years. That...
 When you get involved
with a woman in her 30s
 and it's a relationship
for four years,
 that means something.
 Can we not do this? Please.
 I'm gonna go back in.
I'm sorry that it happened this way.
 I'll call you.
 (NINA SIGHS AND SNIFFS)
 So I spoke to Jacob's psychiatrist.
 He was drunk and more concerned
with his own reputation.
 Piss off.
 (MUFFLED) You missed the party?
 (SOBS)
 I missed the party.
 Hey.
 When did he know?
 I keep chasing that round my head,
but I can't catch it.
 How long has he known?
How long has he been lying to me?
 I wanna know.
 Well, I only met Dennis once.
 He seemed...
 W... I... You were a couple, so...
 I feel like I'm having
a thousand thoughts all at once.
 All this stuff is racing through me.
 You know, for the first 18 months,
he kept obsessing about his ex.
 I put up with that.
 He called it grief. I was patient.
 I mean, how many women
would put up with that?
 And when he was out of work,
I took him on holidays.
 I never once mentioned it.
 Some people, they are just takers
 and he's in that party
and he thinks he's the good guy.
 Well, I'm gonna bloody tell him.
Nina, what would that achieve?
 Achieve? It would achieve me
nailing the bastard for once.
 It would achieve him knowing
he's a selfish, self-centred
 lump of piss.
 Do you know what I want?
I wanna... I wanna hit him.
 I wanna feel myself smacking him.
 Don't hit him, Nina.
 I'm broken-hearted.
 Yeah, but...if you hit him,
you could lose your job.
 (SNIFFS)
 Thanks, Alec.
 Thanks and all that,
but I'm gonna go now.
 I'm coming with you.
 I'm about to have a break-up
with my boyfriend.
 I don't need some bloke from work
there.
 I'm not getting out of your car,
so...
 So, we're looking for this fella,
Jacob Appley.
 We haven't found him yet,
 but I thought I'd tell you
because...
 just reading about it
or seeing it on the news.
 I don't watch the news.
 Anyway...
 I keep thinking about the boy.
 About Luke.
Yeah, I should have said.
 That took courage, what you did.
 What did you make of the meeting?
 Er... Yeah, well...
 I just came along to tell you
about Jacob Appley.
 But it was interesting.
 Lots of silence. (CHUCKLES)
 Aren't you curious
about why I'm a Quaker?
 Yeah, yeah. Well?
 Or you could just tell me.
 Tell someone, Bobby,
what's troubling you
 or you'll go under.
 I get these, like, panic attacks.
 Stuff just gets to me.
 Buskers have got amplifiers now -
so loud.
 I used to love listening to buskers.
 Now, they all think
they're on The X Factor.
 And, like today,
there was this neighbour
 attacking Jacob Appley's brother.
 Why are people so quick to hate?
 So it's building and building
inside me.
 Life's got claws, you know.
It never used to have claws.
 You want a cup of tea?
What?
 Do you want someone to sit with you
for a while?
 I would like that.
 (PHONE RINGS)
 Could just go home
 and you could see Dennis tomorrow,
maybe, when you've calmed down.
 Nina, Nina, Nina.
Dennis!
 I will change.
 This is a wake-up call.
Look, we could try.
 I know what I'm like and...
and this time, the penny's dropped.
 Let's just go back to how it was.
 No pressure or...or anything.
That's not gonna happen, Nina,
 I'm sorry.
Let me show you.
 Look, we'll... All we have to do...
 We can meet up tomorrow or Saturday
 or, you know, whenever you want
and we can... We can talk.
 OK. OK, let's do that.
You're just saying that
 to get rid of me.
I'm trying to tell you, Nina,
 that I'm clear.
No matter how much I say it,
 you don't get it.
 Come on, Nina.
I want children.
 I'll get her home.
 I want children!
 (SOBS)
 (PHONE RINGS)
 Jacob Appley.
 He jumped.
 (DISTANT PHONE RINGS)
 So how long have you felt like this,
Mr Day?
 A while. Quite a while.
Weeks?
 Months.
 It's the job.
It's... I get so stressed.
 We've all been really shaken
by what happened to Angela.
 We don't get many murders here.
 But it's not that,
it's not just the villains.
 They're just hopeless, most of 'em.
Greedy, selfish.
 Selfish?
Yeah.
 Gets to me.
Gets to you?
 It used to be, like, a service.
 Now they talk about budgets.
 There's too much to do.
It's becoming impossible.
 Impossible?
 Why do you keep saying back to me
what I've just said?
 Your current prescription
is helping with your depression.
 What we need to do
is add on something
 to just take away
some of the anxiety.
 There's a chemical in your brain
called dopamine.
 It carries messages.
 If it gets too much, that can cause
the distressing thoughts.
 We just want to slow it down.
 Let's see how we get on, eh?
 The good news - we have a suspect.
 The bad news -
we can't exactly interview him.
 I want a mountain of forensics.
CCTV evidence.
 Let's place him at the scene.
 Angela's clothes.
Jacob Appley's clothes.
 Are we taking that at face value,
sir?
 That he killed himself?
Not face value, no, Alec,
 but he was wanted for murder,
he was on his own,
 and there's no sign of a struggle.
 We will investigate thoroughly
 and if there's reason
to doubt the cause of death,
 you will be the first to know.
Now, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts,
 burn it into your brows -
I want that weapon.
 Thanks, Alec,
you know, for last night.
 For looking after me.
Oh, no.
 Look, are you...um...
Are you all right?
 Thought I knew him.
Unnerves you, doesn't it?
 Well, you never really get people
until you try to see things
 from their point of view.
 Climb into their skin
and walk around in it, you know.
 Yeah? Well you know what, Alec,
right now,
 I don't wanna walk around
in Dennis's skin.
 I wanna peel it slowly
from his bones.
 Right.
 Thank you.
Thanks very much. Thank you.
 We found him. Jacob Appley.
 You probably heard, but I thought...
 How about that cup of tea?
Yeah, thanks.
 BOY: Lucy.
 Hello!
 Oh. Oh, you wanna go in there?
 Do some digging? That's good.
 Eric's struggling a bit.
 Luke knows this place, knows me,
so I offered to have him.
 He's very confused.
 So...erm...will there be a trial
if the person who did it is dead?
 No. No, trial, no but...erm...
 we might need you to ID him.
 You were one of the closest to him
in the park.
 And stuff like
did he go straight across to her
 as though he knew her?
Things like that.
 Well, it looked to me
as though he did.
 I was about to go up to him
when he spotted her.
 It seemed like
he was looking for her.
 That's what I told
the other detective.
 What other detective?
 The one who came here last night.
 Another detective came to see you?
 What, nobody? Did no-one
go and see Miss Cannonbury?
 When did she tell you this, Bobby?
This morning.
 So you went to see her this morning?
Yeah.
 Why did you do that?
To tell her about...
 that we found someone
and that it was all over.
 Do you normally go and see a witness
and tell them that it's over?
 No, not normally.
But you went to see this one
 for some reason?
 It's quite odd,
this witness statement.
 8:50. 15 steps.
She's a perfect witness.
 I mean, what's that all about?
Quaker.
 Huh, it's a weirdo.
Or is it "wierdo"?
 She's a good witness, that's all.
 She might be making
this other detective stuff up.
 She might be one of those
'look at me, look at me' types.
 Nina, go and see her.
Give her one of your makeovers.
 Let me at her.
 Did you see any identification?
Did he offer you any?
 Er... It didn't occur to me.
 Did he tell you his name?
Detective Galen.
 And what did he ask you,
Miss Cannonbury?
 He asked me what I saw.
He asked me about Jacob Appley.
 He asked me did I see his face.
He wanted to know
 if it looked like Appley
was looking for Doctor Benton.
 And then what did Appley do
afterwards?
 Did he just run or was he looking
at Doctor Benton on the ground?
 And...erm...
 He wanted to know,
did I see anyone else there.
 Anyone else?
What did he mean by that?
 Did I notice anyone
odd or different or unusual?
 And did you?
No.
 Erm... He asked did Angela
have anything with her?
 Did Appley take anything from her?
 And what did you tell him?
 She had nothing.
 You go there to read?
Yes.
 That's a peculiar place to read,
isn't it?
 Noisy for concentrating.
 Traffic is noise.
 Children are not noise.
 Describe this 'Detective Galen'.
 Did he have an accent?
Was he tall, small, fat, balding?
 He...was...
 genuine.
 That doesn't help.
 He was 5'10". No taller.
 Slight build. Thinning on top.
 He was convincing. That does help.
Don't you contradict me.
 I'm just saying he came across
as professional. Alec, button it.
 I did notice something. Erm...
 All of his questions
were written down.
 There was no call for that.
It was spiteful.
 You didn't have to crucify her.
You did that deliberately.
 She's some X-ray-eyed witness.
She saves the child by coincidence
 and then, oh, wait for it,
she's making coo-coo eyes
 at one of the primary detectives.
Did she proposition you? No.
 She offered me a cup of tea
when I went to see her last night.
 You went to see her last night
as well?
 The only reason I'm not taking her
in right now is to save your career.
 All of his questions
were written down.
 What's that about?
And this Detective Galen
 asked if Angela had anything
with her.
 There is no Detective Galen!
 The Quaker's sex bomb made him up.
 Get in.
 Nina was cruel to Lucy.
What's the matter with her?
 Oh, she split up with Dennis.
 Tell the whole department,
why don't you?
 Give the man a loudhailer.
Look, I'll save you the bother.
 Is there anybody out there doesn't
know my boyfriend's dumped me?
 I'm 38 years old.
 I'm childless.
My arse is starting to sag.
 And the flake
I thought was gonna marry me
 has given me the shove.
 Will that do you?
 Yes.
 7:45, thank you.
 I'm...erm...
I'm sorry about you and Dennis.
 Why did you let me
make a tit of myself
 in front of the whole department?
 ALEC: Thank you very much.
Thank you, bye.
 I made some calls. Get this.
 Galen went to see
seven other witnesses
 and Angela's father.
So Lucy was telling the truth.
 Hands up, I did not see that coming.
 Seven?! Who is this creepo?
 We spoke to Staffordshire,
Merseyside,
 half a dozen other forces.
 No-one's gone anywhere near
our witnesses
 and we can't find a Detective Galen
on the National Register.
 Okay, let's stop calling him Galen.
 He wants us to do that.
He wants that name in our heads
 so it directs our thinking.
What do we call him?
 The Ghost Detective?
 Yeah.
 What he asked Lucy was
did she see anybody else there
 and did the killer take anything
from her?
 Bobby,
this was left at reception for you.
 Thanks, Megan.
 Yeah, PC Waters, thank you.
 Look, if it is some random killing,
 then how come
the Ghost Detective asked
 if anyone else was there?
I mean, what does that mean?
 What the...?
 (READS)
 We need to talk to her dad again.
 She lived in Dusseldorf.
 She met him.
 Luke's father.
 Worked there.
 Lived there with him.
 What's this man's name?
 He's an American.
His name, Mr Benton.
 What has this to do with anything?
 Was there any trouble
between him and Angela, over Luke?
 Animosity? What kind of a man is he?
 I was told you had the man
who did this.
 We have a suspect.
 We need to contact Luke's father to
inform him of...of Angela's death.
 I've no idea how to get in touch
with him.
 I've hardly caught my breath.
 Angela will have
his email address, no?
 Angela doesn't have a computer.
 What is this?
No computer?
 I notice she has a typewriter.
I'm 68.
 I have a three-year-old child
to bring up
 and I know that in his head,
that little boy
 saw his mother stabbed to death.
 Have you no mercy, man?
 OK, Alec, we'll leave it there.
 What was it she was typing?
Alec, I said we're done.
 Thank you for your help, Mr Benton.
 We'll leave you alone now.
 What was his name, Luke's father?
 Ruben Locana.
 Hey. What is it, Nina?
 (SIGHS) Dennis used to say to me,
 "We'll have kids next year
when we settle".
 He let me believe.
 I mean, these are the years.
If a woman doesn't...
 I have to know,
did he never want children?
 Probably doesn't know himself.
 At what age, exactly, did you
turn into the font of wisdom?
 I'm old.
38 is not old.
 Why have I been so good?
 I never did the casual thing.
I always did relationships. Steady.
 I missed out.
 Why did I never just have fun?
 I can have some fun.
 Why do I have to be so buttoned up?
 Look, Nina, I like you, it's...
Stop, don't say another word.
 I don't wanna hear it.
I can't bear any more rejection.
 It never happened.
None of this happened.
 (SIGHS)
 (KNOCKS ON WINDOW)
 I was hoping I might see you.
Doctor Crowley.
 You could have just
come into the station.
 Yes. Yes, I could, but...erm...
because of who you are,
 er...your mother...
 I've prepared this for you.
 It's about Jacob.
 And more generally
about schizophrenia.
 The word means "split mind".
 It's been on my mind
that I wasn't much assistance.
 You caught me at an off moment.
I don't want it
 to reflect badly on you that you
came away with no information, so...
 And why should it reflect badly
on me?
 Because of my past association
with your mother.
 "Past association"?
Is that what you call it?
 I think we both know
who that would reflect badly on.
 Look, psychopathic schizophrenics.
 I read that they don't feel regret,
 so I'm wondering -
why would Jacob kill himself?
 There are no objective tests
for schizophrenia.
 People don't understand that.
 We diagnose primarily
on a person's behaviour.
 If they do certain things,
believe certain things,
 perhaps suffer hallucinations,
false beliefs.
 A lot of it is opinion.
 I would say suicide is a possibility
 if Jacob had an awareness
of what he'd done.
 I thought I might go
to see your mother.
 And why would you do that?
To reassure her
 that I wouldn't wish
to cause you any difficulties.
 You stay away from my mother.
 Well, Jacob's dead.
 Er... Let's hope this all
just quiets down.
 Hi. Morning, Nina.
No, don't.
 Don't do that "Let's pretend
it's a normal day" thing, all right?
 All right.
Alec.
 (Come here.)
 Look, I had a moment.
 If you tell anyone, I will kill you.
 Look, breakups and stuff, OK,
people get strange. It happens.
 Don't be nice to me either
cos everyone will notice.
 Just just be your normal, cocky
know-it-all self.
 I've arranged a Skype call.
 Detective Linda Felber
in Dusseldorf.
 We can ask her to make contact
with Ruben Locana.
 (SKYPE CALLING TONE)
 Hello, there.
It's a little bit noisy here.
 I have four kids, all boys,
 so it gets noisy, you know.
 Five boys, if you count my husband.
 I've been trying to get rid of him
for years, but he's still here.
 So, what can I do for you?
 We were wondering if you could
help us, Detective Felber.
 Come on now - Linda.
 I'm Nina Suresh.
Alec Wayfield. Bobby Day.
 I took a look at where you live
on the internet.
 It's such a beautiful place
you have there. Yeah...
 The English countryside
is like a fairytale.
 Look, Linda, we had a death here.
A murder.
 A young mother, Angela Benton.
We can send you the file.
 Our suspect is a schizophrenic,
lives nearby.
 We have reason to feel ambiguous
about it all.
 Our suspect has died.
He might have been killed.
 Before we could question him.
Interesting.
 This...er... This Ruben Locana.
 Er... Did we mention him? Erm...
 He's the father
of Angela Benton's son.
 And he's American.
But he lives in Dusseldorf.
 We don't know if Mr Locana
knows about Angela.
 If you could inform him.
And there's other stuff
 that makes us want to contact him.
"Other stuff"?
 OK. Interesting.
 What is the other stuff?
 A tip-off.
Anonymous tip-off.
 The reason Angela was killed might
have something to do with her ex.
 Basically, if...er...
you could seek out Ruben Locana
 and get the measure of him,
we'd be...we'd be grateful.
 Leave it with me, my friends.
 Hande uber die wasser.
Hands across the water.
 Bye!
 (BUZZER)
 Hello? Mr Locana?
