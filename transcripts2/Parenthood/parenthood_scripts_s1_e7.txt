Two people from two different high schools. Hundreds of miles- decades apart. That we pinpointed the exact same paragraph In that book. - That's a little weird. - That is weird.

If max cleans up his toys, he gets a sticker. Okay, I'll just live like this. And when exactly am I supposed To schedule this "me time" for myself? Adam, I don't know.
