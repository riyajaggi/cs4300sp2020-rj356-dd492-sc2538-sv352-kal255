 You need a date. Jim Kazinsky! He was real cute. Really? I'm setting it up. (PANTING) Oh, damn. No condoms. SARAH: It's okay. JIM: Why does your dad have condoms in his desk drawer? SARAH: I don't know. JIM: Do you think he's having an affair? Oh, my God! Stop talking! So, you're saying that you'll have a baby with me in three years? Yep. CROSBY: Who's this?

 He wanted to meet his dad. You must be Julia! JOEL: This is Racquel! Hi. You are so amazing. Oh. Alrighty. Max's behaviors are consistent with an Asperger's diagnosis. Oh, my God. (LOUD BUBBLING) Teacher, can you please turn the bubbles down or something? TEACHER: Max, I need you to be quiet. (LOUD BUBBLING CONTINUES) Max, I need you to return to your seat. Max, please go back and sit down now. (CLANGING) Ahoy!

 (LAUGHS) Careful. (LAUGHS) Hey, there, Captain. Welcome aboard. What do you got there? Games. Oh, games. I love games. Jump! Jump! JASMINE: Yeah. Come on in. Okay. Hello. Why don't you set those down over there, sweetie? JABBAR: Oh, okay. That's his ejector seat? A flotation device, or... I can't tell you how much I appreciate this, Crosby. Hey, a whole day with Jabbar, what could be better? So, you have my numbers. If you need to call for anything... Am I going to need to call? Is he going to do something, or... No, he'll be fine. You know. Okay. Things happen. Just in case. Okay. The audition's in the city, so... Well, break a leg. I might. (CHUCKLES) Seriously. It's been a long time since I danced. Well, um, you're a great dancer. Thank you. You're limber, I think I remember. And as long as you warm up... Thanks? ...you're gonna be... (LAUGHS) You'll be fine. Thanks for the advice. Oh, hey, um, when we play games... Mmm-hmm. ...I'm supposed to let him win, right? You might not have to let him. He cheats. Okay, thank you. He's a genius. Okay. I'll be on the lookout for it. Just like me. Can I have a kiss goodbye, please? Bye. Be good. Okay. Have fun. Dance hard or gracefully or whatever. JASMINE: Good luck. Have fun. Well, can I get you something to drink? Mmm-hmm. Whiskey or beer? RACQUEL: Erin, holding tight to the board! Yeah! (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) SYDNEY: Look, there's Mommy! Hey. JOEL: They let you out of the dungeon. Oh, yeah. Oh. Hi. Hi. (BOTH LAUGHING) Look at my big girl in a grown-up pool! JOEL: Mmm-hmm. Mommy, look. That's great, sweetie. Let me see some swimming. Okay. (BLOWING BUBBLES) What is she doing? She's getting acclimated. It's all about feeling safe and confident in the water. Right? Oh. She could do that in a bowl of soup when she was two. Just this... Julia. Hi. What? Racquel, hi. SYDNEY: Mommy, look! Racquel has a tattoo. See it? We all see it. It means abundance. I'm sure it does. Hey. I have something for you. Joel told me about your nephew Max and his new condition. He did? So, I got this in Tibet last summer. Will you please give it to your brother for me? For comfort and good luck. Wow. Thank you. Okay. JOEL: That's really sweet. (RACQUEL SIGHS) (PHONE RINGING) Yep? ASSISTANT: Adam, it's your son's school on the line. They say it's an emergency. Adam Braverman. Were they able to save any? No. So, that's it, then. We're out of here. Probably. (SIGHING) I was gonna make fish for dinner, too. Yeah. Hey. I'm so happy you came in. Thanks. I'm so happy to see you. I just wanted to say hi. Hi. Yeah, I know. I left you a couple of messages, uh, at your house... I know. I'm sorry. At home. No, no, it's, like, you're busy... Half-Caf soy latte. Extra large. I gave you an extra shot of hazelnut. (CHUCKLES) My personal favorite. Thank you. I didn't order anything. Oh, it's our pleasure. Hmm. Enjoy. That's Stacy, and that's Bob, Alex, and Troy. (AIR HISSING) (INAUDIBLE) Hi. Oh, thanks. One of the perks of, uh, working at a coffee shop. Perk. I get it. Perks. Free coffee. (LAUGHS) Um, I really had fun the other night. And, uh, it was really fun to, you know... You know. (CHUCKLES) I did too, and I'm so glad you said that, 'cause, you know... It was nice. It was nice. You're so nice. (SIGHS) Nice. Yeah. You know, the timing right now is not great. Really, it's... Is that it? I just got here. I'm living in a room in my parents' house with my daughter. You know, I don't have a job. I... I mean... I got it. It's not me, it's you. Exactly. It's not you, it's me. (SCOFFS) (SIGHS) (ENGINE SPUTTERING) No, no. Oh, no, no, no. No, no, not today, baby. Not today. Come on, let's go. Let's go. This is not funny. Please. (SIGHS) Oh, crap. No! No! (PHONE BEEPS) (GROANS) You'll never believe what... Can I borrow a phone? I'm so sorry. You know what? Never mind. Never... I'll find a... (STUTTERS) Thanks for the coffee. (BEEPING) Whoa. Whoa, what happened here? Uh, angry baristas, bad starter motor. Oh. No, no. You got a blown head gasket. Look at all the coolant here. No, that's old, Dad. I fixed that eight months ago. You pulled the head and replaced the gasket yourself? You know who taught me. That is my girl! I tell you what. (LAUGHS) Why don't you and I work on this puppy together? Dad. It will be just like old times. Dad, I think it's a goner. God, again? Oh, no, honey. You know what? Grandpa and I are gonna fix it. Guess I should get used to taking the bus. Hey, excuse me. Sorry, I couldn't hear that. You mumbled. What was with that little smirk? We won! We won! (IN SINGSONG) We're going to the finals! We're going to the finals! Wow, that's great. That's fantastic. That is awesome. Honey, I'm sorry that we didn't make it. KRISTINA: We just... There was some... When's the big game? That's okay. Why are you guys being weird? Uh, we're not. We're not being weird. (STUTTERING) When's... When's the big game? What's the... What's the exact date of the finals? Max, what's wrong? (TOYS CLATTERING) I got kicked out of school. Oh, um... You know what, big guy? That's their loss. That school sucked. Yes! I won. Again. Uh-huh. All right, you clocked me fair and square. One more. There's only so much defeat a man can take. I can play even easier. Oh, really? Is there anything else you want to do? Not really. No. Well, okay, we've got a solid six or seven hours before Mom's back. Ooh! ESPN, anyone? I don't really watch sports. We can watch more SpongeBob! (INHALES) Ooh, well, let's not be hasty. I would hate to see you OD on Bob. Maybe we could, uh... Let's go for a car ride. That's what my dad used to do. You like car rides? Can I take the board? Oh, could you? Okay, well, what if I told you to do that for me, huh? (SQUEALING) So, was this a fish bowl or an actual... It was a tank. Yeah. Tank. Pretty sizeable tank. Were there any... (SCOFFS) Survivors? No. Well, Sullivan's recommending you change Max's placement. If that means that they kicked him out of the school, then, yes. We've looked into a few schools. The one that everybody keeps telling us about is Footpath Elementary. Footpath, yeah. Yeah, that would be best, and it would be a good fit for Max. However, it is very hard to get into. It is quite expensive. How expensive? You know how much private school costs? Double that. It doesn't matter. Okay? Okay. Well, you would need to contact Dr. Robertson in admissions. We have called her. KRISTINA: (SIGHS) Several times. Radio silence. Over and... I'm sure that she'll get back to you within the week. Look, Dr. Pelikan, my son, Max, doesn't have a school to go to. What am I supposed to tell him? You know, what if you called her on our behalf? Please. Look, don't make us come and sit in your waiting room on a daily basis. 'Cause we'll do it. We will. (LOUD MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) Can you take me home now? Huh? Can you take me home now? Are you kidding, buddy? We've got two and a half hours of bonding time left. What do you think of these streets? They're like roller coasters, right? Are you all right, buddy? Now I remember why my mom says that I can't eat chocolate. I'm intolerant... You're what? (VOMITING) (GRUNTS IN DISGUST) ...of lactose. Yeah. Yep. I see that. Oh, come on. (WATER SPLASHING) Question. JOEL: Yes, counselor. Are we at all concerned that Sydney has had five swim lessons now, and all she can do is, (MIMICS BLOWING BUBBLES). Uh, we are not concerned. I know you were on the swim team and you were really, really good. I was not just really, really good. I was all CIF. Oh. Okay. Well? Mommy, come see! God! Bravermans are so cocky. Hey. Mommy, look. (LAUGHS) (BUBBLES BLOWING) I'm swimming. That's not swimming, baby. Don't let anybody tell you that that's swimming. Hey, what is this? What is... It's just like Racquel's. It means abundance. I know what it means. Okay. Swim time's over. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) You've dealt with kid puke before, right? ADAM: Uh-huh. (SIGHING) Whoo. I don't know how you do it, man. Do what? This kid thing. It's stressing me out. Come on, man. You had Jabbar for, what, half a day? You know, whatever. You had a little warm-up. You know, you got to see your bun bake in the oven. My kid came out talking and walking. A three-foot-tall little Candyland master. Well, give it time. Well, that's easy for you to say. (BREATHING DEEPLY) You know what, Crosby? However hard you think it is having a kid... Just double it. Yeah, well, he's coming over again. And I have to work. What, am I supposed to bring him to the studio? I... I can't handle this. You want us to watch him? Seriously? No, jackass. He's your son. Grow a pair. Deal with it. (SCOFFS) Uh, I wasn't going to take you up on it, anyways. Oh, okay. What makes all this worth it? What makes it worth it is the connection. It's the bond you feel. They're yours, you know? And... You're part of them. Well, what if I don't feel a connection? You know, any... Any more than you'd feel to any kid? You will. (SIGHING) I think it's better. (SNIFFING) Oh, man. Ugh! Not even close, my friend. I'll see you inside. What, are you just leaving me here? Yep. Good night. Hey! We're not done here. (SIGHS) Ow. (GRUNTING) (SARAH SHUSHING) (SARAH SCREAMING) (THUDDING) (SNORING) SARAH: Honey. (SIGHING) Honey! Honey! (EXCLAIMS) Watch it! I have to sleep. I'm trying to sleep here. What's wrong with you? I'm so tired. Come on. Give me a break. I've never been so tired. Give me a break. Give me one little break so that I can get some sleep. Can you just move over a little bit. Look. I can't do this with you. I need more space! You're hogging all... I can't do it anymore, either. Can you please remind me why little, tiny Drew gets his own room? Drew's a boy. Do you want to share a room with Drew? Not really. But, you know, I'm not really loving this, either. No offense. I'm not loving it, either. Whatever. Tomorrow, I'm asking Grandpa if I can move out... You're not asking Grandpa. Why? You're not asking Grandpa. Why not? He doesn't need it back there. He's retired. Because... (CRYING) My God. I am so tired. What is wrong with you? Nothing is wrong with me. Why are you being such a weenie about this? That's his private space. I'm not being a weenie. Every time I bring up Grandpa, you get all, like, weenie, and you're usually so ballsy. What's going on? That's mean. (SIGHING) That's not true. (SNORES) (SIGHS) Got a minute? For my little sister, I do, yeah. Great. You want to go to Berkeley Coffee? They love me over there, ever since I hooked Jim up with Sarah. It's like, free biscotti, an Immensimo when I only order a Minimo... Uh-huh. Looks like maybe you've had a few too many. Well... I would love to go. But I have to get out of here early today. So, is it okay if we just talk while I answer some e-mails and I kind of half-listen to you? Yeah. That will work. Okay. Okay. So... (SIGHING) What's up? Joel has Sydney in this Zen swimming class, which is basically a joke. Right. And then, there's Racquel, which is just... Wait. Racquel, the hot one? Is she hot? I hadn't noticed. Do you remember what a great swimmer I was? Yeah. You were all CIF. I was. Thank you. Gosh. That... That... Oh, that means a lot to me that you remember that. You're welcome. Okay. Anyway, I don't get a say in how my daughter's learning how to swim. Me. All CIF. Because you have to work. Because I have to work. Julia, listen to me. You don't have to choose between being a mom and having to work. Okay? Yeah. You may not be there all the time. But the time that you do have, you can make it count. She's your daughter. Teach her how to swim. She'll remember that for the rest of her life. You're absolutely right. Well... (LAUGHING) You're the best. Well... Oh, my God. Oh. Okay. I'll see you later. Okay, bye. No, sorry. Wait. What? I have something for you. It's from Racquel. What? Yeah. It's a Tibetan prayer stone. Well, that's... That's weird. For comfort and good luck. Okay. With Max. Right. Okay. Well, uh, thank her for me. Yeah. If I must. All right. Teach that girl how to swim. Yes. Who's a better teacher than you? No one. No one. See you. God. (BOTH SCREAMING) (LAUGHING) What are you doing back here? Nothing. I just... Was just taking a minute. Everything okay? Yeah. I'll see you there. Oh, guess who called. Hmm? Jim Kazinsky. (LAUGHING) I forgot how funny he is. Yeah. Do you remember his uncle? The one who married the transsexual? They're still together. Do you believe it? I mean, God. Talk about bucking the odds. How long did you talk to him for? A while. Why? Because he called. For me. He called for me. And we just broke up. You know we just broke up. I mean, can't you just say, "She's not here. I'll take a message. "She'll call you back." Oh. Excuse me. Well, I'm not going to be rude to him. Did you talk about his transsexual relatives for half an hour? I like him. I've always liked Jim. I know. If only I had married Jim instead of that musician, how differently my life would have turned out. I never said that. You didn't have to say it. Don't be so over-sensitive. Over-sensitive! Don't... Well, listen. Um... Your dad and I want you to let us buy you a new car. No. Well, not a new car, of course. A... A used car. No. But one with a warranty. Not a junkyard car. Come on. You're long overdue. Mom. Isn't it bad enough? (SIGHS) I'm living at home. You're feeding me. You're feeding my kids. You may not buy me a car. Okay, fine. ADAM: This place is a lot bigger than I thought it was. It's huge. Chipped paint over there on the wall. Yeah, I don't see what all the hoopla is about. It's kind of dirty. (CHILDREN CHATTERING) Look, it would be tough to afford this place, anyway. I know. KRISTINA: When we were reading about the kids in your program, they seemed so much like Max, it was incredible. And then, we just saw this boy down the hall, uh, in the classroom. He was dressed up like a sailor. Sailor. Which is just like Max with his pirate costume. That's Kellen. Kellen James. He's a good kid. He's really cute. Yeah, he's good. (SIGHS) I understand your enthusiasm. However, we've already taken in one new child for the third grade class. But you took... You took a look at Max's file, and you spoke with Dr. Pelikan? Yes, I did. He did... So, you understand what we're dealing with here. Mmm-hmm. Our son, Max, is somewhere in between. Yeah. He's too high-functioning for a special-needs program, but he doesn't really... He has... He has real trouble fitting into a mainstream school. He needs some help. So, what do you... What do you do with a child like that? You bring him to a school like ours. Right. In September. I'm sorry. Are you saying that you won't even see him? We just feel like, if you spent some time with him, and you... You sat down with him, you would see what we do as parents. I mean, he's... The kid's incredible. If you just meet him. See, I don't want to give you a false sense of hope. Because it's really, really very unlikely... Listen, he's a fantastic kid, Dr. Robertson... I understand that. I'm not just saying that because he's my son. He's great. He's funny. He's bright. He says the oddest, most hilarious things I've ever heard in my entire life. He plays the harmonica in a weirdly good way. Yeah. He does. And he plays chess. He doesn't really play chess so much, but he makes up stories with the little pieces on the board. Like, "Oh, I'm going to kick you. "I'm going to attack you." You know, we just... We just want you to meet him. Just 15 minutes of your time. That's all. Just... Just meet him. Mmm-hmm. That's it. And if you say no, then, at least, you'll have made an informed decision. Just meet him. Please. Five minutes. I'm not going to promise anything, all right? But you're going to meet him. That's all we ask. I'm going to meet him. Thank you. Okay, I'm going to meet him. Thank you. She's going to meet him. I'm going to meet him. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Thank you. I have to get some work done. Great, okay. Thank you. You look a little bit like Oprah. Good afternoon. Bye. Be careful. Take care. Take care. Oh, should I leave it open? Please do. Have a great one. (MUSIC PLAYING) Mommy! RACQUEL: Julia. Hi, sweetie. You're like a fish. You want me to teach you how to swim like a fish? Yeah. (LAUGHING) All right. Nice entrance. Thanks. You know how Grandpa Zeek taught me to swim? He dropped me in the deep end of the pool when I was two. I'm going to ask you to trust me. Okay? All right? Swim to me. (STUTTERING) But I don't know how to swim. I saw you kicking. That's all you need to know how to do. Okay? I'm scared. Just kick off, let go and come here. I'm right here. I can't. Yeah, you can, baby. We know you can. Come on. We're right here. We're not going to let anything bad happen. We're right here. Promise? Promise. Promise. Absolutely. You've got it. Come on. Okay, she's going to kick. She's going to kick. Come on. She's sinking, is what she's doing. Well, give her a second. Come on. Help, Daddy! Help! You did it, baby! Mommy, help! Daddy! (COUGHING) You swam! You drowned me! (COUGHING) It's all right. She swam. She... I love how they call it "automotive recycling." I mean, what's wrong with "junk"? "Junk" is an honest word. SARAH: Look at these, Dad. Some of these cars have been around since the first time you brought me here. (LAUGHS) Ooh, Dad, look at that. Pontiac. What is that, T-1000? Maybe we could use some of that. Well, that's a good eye, but it looks like it's been stripped. Yeah. Oh, look at this. 1948 Cadillac. Now, I always wanted one of these. Huh? (LAUGHING) That's American steel, right there. The big iron. What would you think, Dad, if I moved into your office for a little while? Well, honey, why the hell do you want to sleep back there? It's all moldy. Well, maybe. But me and Amber in that little room... (EXCLAIMS) It's kind of tight. You know, I work back there, sweetheart. Right. Well, here you go. See? This is an engine you can work on. Isn't that beautiful? Dad, why do you have condoms in the office? I don't want to talk to you about that. I'm so sorry. I just... I thought that I could help... You could just pop in and have everything your way, and then pop out? You're mad. You should have told me. She did swim. You saw that. (SIGHS) I'll see you at home. (CHILDREN CHATTERING) Joel. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Hey, sugar. Hey, guys. CROSBY: All right. You want to learn how to work this thing? Mmm-hmm. All right. Here we go. What we want to do is add some drums, right? (DRUM BEATS PLAYING) Yep. Hear that? Hmm. What does that need? Ooh. I know. Yeah. A little bass. Put some bass in there. Okay. It's starting to sound pretty good. But I think I need a little something more. Let's throw some guitar in there. Okay. Then we go like this, and then, boom. Whoa! Huh? Cool! Right? Don't tell anyone around here what you saw. Because I don't want anyone to know how fun my job is. Hey, Crosby. Oh, look. It's Happy Hollows. Hey. How's it going? We're so excited. Oh, good. We were thinking tonight, maybe we could just do it, um, live and kind of get that raw and natural sort of feel. That's good. We'll capture it. Cool. Who's that? Oh, uh, this is my sound engineer assistant, Jabbar. Hi, Jabbar. Hi. He's very gifted. (LAUGHS) Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Is he going to impinge? Oh, no, he never... He never impinges. I promise. Because this is really, really important to us. Take how important it is to you. Quadruple it. That's how important it is to Jabbar. (LAUGHING) Okay. Go, go set up. Awesome. CROSBY: Get wild. Hi. Hi. How was your day? Fine. Uh, maybe you should let Grandma and Grandpa help us buy a new car? I'm just saying. You, too? I'm just saying. Hey. Come here for a second. (SIGHING) I want to explain to you why I don't want to do that. In this family, we take care of ourselves, and we don't expect other people to help us. Which is why, by the time I was your age, I knew how to change a tire and... Bake a casserole. Only... A casserole! And break into a car and... Oh, a car. Fashion a teepee out of wood and leather. Oh, really? Really, now? All right. I was just saying. You don't believe me? I don't think you get my point. Come here. Mom, I get the point. It's... Do you? Yes. I understand. Then give me a hug. What? What? Come here! (LAUGHING) I don't want to touch you. You're still my favorite son. Don't half-ass it! (SINGING) I've felt that I've always been Doing a magical job Once it felt so very fun putting on the gun We should stand and decide If you asked me I would tell you As abandoned, I've felt that I've always been Doing a magical job Once it felt so very fun putting on the gun We should stand and decide (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (CLICKING TONGUE) I'm sorry. All right. Now, remember, Max, there's no pressure. Okay? Just be yourself. I will. Are you hungry, honey? Do you want a snack? I have crackers. Here, I have a banana, I have an apple, I have some trail mix... I'm fine. I have a granola bar, I have a hard-boiled egg. I'm fine. I'm fine. Do you have to pee? No. Are you sure? It's right down the hall. A granola bar? Chinese mix? An apple? You just said that. Is something wrong? No, why? Because you're saying the same thing over and over again. Which is what you do when something's wrong. No. No, we don't. Okay, Max. We're ready for you. Exciting. ADAM: No pressure. Good luck. Thank you. He'll be just fine. If you asked me Pretty cool, huh? I would tell you Jabbar? Jabbar. Oh, come on. Jabbar? Jabbar. Oh! Man, you scared the crap out of me. Sorry. Hey, fianc?. Hey. Uh... What are you doing back? Oh. I came straight from the airport. Apparently, music history is being made, and the band's manager told me that I needed to be here. Here you go, big guy. Uh... Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, no, no, no. Thank you. No, no, no, no, no. He... He can't drink that. He's lactose intolerant. (SIGHING) Oh. Well, sorry. Yeah. Uh, let's see what else we can get you. So, Crosby, who is this little fellow? Um, hey. Hi. (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) Uh, welcome back. I... I don't know. He, uh... One of the girls up front asked me to watch him. Okay. Well, it's really nice to meet you. And I'm going to go check on the band. (DOOR OPENING) Hey. SARAH: Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? KRISTINA: Hi. What... What's up? I just... I thought you might be nervous, so... So, you brought us coffee. To calm us down. That was very nice of you. Just kidding. It's very nice. Thank you, Sarah. What have you got there? A rock, or... No, it's a Tibetan prayer stone. Oh, dear God. It's come to this? I'm just... I'm not taking any chances. This? Hey. I'm not... Hey! It was an absolute pleasure to meet you, Max. You, too. KRISTINA: Hey, buzzo. Is everything okay? I'll call you tomorrow. All right. See you, Max. MAX: See you. SARAH: Hi, bud. Look forward to your call. Hi. Did Haddie win her game? Oh, God. We've got to go. Come on. Come on. Come on, you guys. Where are we going? Let's go. Haddie's game. Her finals are today. (GASPS) You forgot her game? KRISTINA: Come on, baby. ADAM: Haddie. KRISTINA: Hi, sweetie. Haddie, listen. We are so sorry. I'm sorry. We got stuck at Max's interview, and... Hey, you won. It looks like... Yeah. Haddie? Can we just go, please? MAX: Where does it go? All right. Okay. You know what, honey? I'm sorry. ADAM: We're very sorry, okay. Can you understand that? Max, come on, honey. Max. Come on. Max! (DISTANT TAPPING) (METALLIC CLANGING) (LOUD TAPPING) Hey. (SIGHING) I put some oil on this bolt. So, I think it's loosening. What do you have, the half-inch? Yeah. You might try a smaller one. That's true. Here. (GRUNTING) Give you a little more oil. Could you use this? See if it works? Wrong one. It goes. Kind of. Here. I'm gonna put this on there. See if it works. Did you get those off? Yeah. You're getting really strong. Thank you. Come here. Give me a hand. (LAUGHING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) You mind if I come in? Yeah, it's fine, Dad. I'm over it. No, it's not fine. (SIGHING) There are some days when you just blow it. You know? And that is what happened today. I blew it. And I'm... I'm really, really sorry. It's okay. Really. And I know with everything that has been going on with Max, you've been having a rough couple of weeks, too. Weeks? Dad. Try years. What? It's been years, Dad. Why is everybody acting like this Max thing is big news? He knocked over the cake at my 10th birthday because he was afraid of the candles. We had to change rooms because he couldn't be by the air conditioner. Uh, whenever he wants to watch TV, we all have to give up. It's like... It's never-ending. And ever since I can remember, it's been all about Max. You're right. You're absolutely right. Do you think he's going to get into this school? I am very... Very proud of you. In so many ways. Hey. Hey. They kept you late. Yes, they did. Price you pay for taking a little dip in the middle of the day. Yeah. Speaking of that... Hey, Sydney? Mom's home. Hi, sweetie. Mommy, look. What is it? Look, it's me. JOEL OVER PHONE: Ready? Go! You got it! You got it! Keep going! Look at you! I did it! Yeah! You did it! You swam? Yeah. Away from the side and back. Oh! Show me again. Okay. She never would have been able to do it without you torturing her. SYDNEY: I did it! JOEL: Yeah! You did it! High five! Show me again. (BOTH LAUGHING) How much longer? Uh, your mom said she'd be here any minute now. Hey. Listen. You know what I told that lady before, about who you were? I just got really scared. And it was stupid. It's okay. I understand. You do? (CHUCKLES) Is this why you ran and hid? Because you broke this off the mixing board? I thought you'd be mad. You know... I would have done the exact same thing. (CHUCKLES) All right, then. (SIGHING) I guess that's it. You sure? Mmm-hmm. You're not going to cry over this piece of junk, are you? No. Okay. (CRYING) I know it's a bad car. It just... Amber said her first word in it, "No." Drew came within two blocks of being born in it. It hardly ever worked, but the day I needed to move them out of Seth's, it started on the first try. (SNIFFLING) Ready? Yeah. Okay! MAN: We're good. (ENGINE STARTING) Sarah, um, your mother and I, we haven't been doing very well. Yeah, I've been spending a lot of time in the guest house. I've been sleeping there. And that's why I told you you couldn't move in. So, uh... It was selfish. I'm selfish sometimes. I want you to know that... Please. Go ahead. Move in. You sure? Yeah. And don't worry about your mom and I. We're going to be doing okay. Okay. (INHALES DEEPLY) What time did those people from Footpath Elementary say they were going to call? KRISTINA: (SIGHING) 11:00, I think. I'm not going to make it. You want to make out? Hmm. (DOORBELL RINGING) (GRUNTING) ADAM: Hey! (LAUGHS) Good morning! Good morning! Good morning. We're going swimming. JOEL: Oh, yeah. Swimming. Swimming! Swimming. You know, that thing where you go... All right, listen, you guys. I'm waiting for a very important phone call. I know. But that's not for four hours. So, let's go. Bring your cell phone. Come on. (LAUGHING) None of that! All right. All right. We brought coffee. JOEL: Kiss the grouch. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! This summer I went swimming This summer I might have drowned But I held my breath and I kicked my feet And I moved my arms around I moved my arms around This summer I swam in the ocean And I swam in a swimming pool Salt my wounds Chlorine my eyes I'm a self-destructive fool I'm a self-destructive fool No, but I like Hungarian goulash. (LAUGHING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) I love it. Oh, my God. Adam? Honey, it's Footpath. Is that it? It's Footpath. Yes, it is. Can you answer it? (RINGING CONTINUES) Hurry, hurry! Hi. Yes, this is Adam. Yes. Okay. I understand. Okay. Bye. He got in! He got in. He got in! (ALL CHEERING) ADAM: Yeah, he got in! And once when you weren't looking I did a cannonball I did a cannonball This summer I went swimming This summer I might have drowned But I held my breath and I kicked my feet And I moved my arms around Moved my arms around (ALL CHEERING) (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) Here we go. So, excited? I'm excited. Okay if I run ahead? It's 8:14. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Have a good day, Max. KRISTINA: We love you. (CHILDREN CHATTERING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (SIGHING) Hey, Sarah. Can I come in?
