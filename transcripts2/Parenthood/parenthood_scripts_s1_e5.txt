Hey, dad. What's up, Adam? Hey. You know, I thought he was a loser Before he started dating Haddie. Oh, Amber. Hmm? I hear you're turning into quite the English scholar. How did you hear? Was it the skywriter that my mom hired, Or was it the full-page ad she took out? It was the billboard on San Pablo, of course. Listen, don't worry about that. There's nothing that travels faster Than word of a Braverman's accomplishments. And, seriously, an "A" from Mr. Cyr--nice going. Yeah. He supposed to be really hard. Thanks, dude. Uh, Camille, this crisp is amazing. Do I sense some nutmeg? Yeah, Camille, what is it? Very good. "Camille"? "Camille"? It took me two years to call her that. I still can't. Can I call her Camille? No. He's a keeper, huh? Hey, Cammie? [laughs] Cam-cam, can we get a little vanilla ice cream, Go a la mode on this crisp? I think he's sweet. He seems like a nice guy. Yeah, he does. He's cute. Definitely cute. He's cute. He's really cute. Isn't he? No. No, no, no, no, it's sick, okay? She looks at him like some sort of doe-eyed Disney character. Yeah, dude, that's what teenage girls Look like when they're in love. She's not in love. Yeah, well, you're a moron. Oh, ouch. Do you remember Sarah with Seth When she first met him? Oh, my God. "oh, I just loved "your cover of in your eyes. Your solo totally kicked ass." The hair flip. Yes, it was the flip. "Camille, this crisp is so delicious. Is there nutmeg in it?" He's just such a little-- A little what? You know, seriously, if just one girl Had actually had a crush on you, You wouldn't be freaking out. I did. Well, Crosby, You seem to forget about Lisa Rainford, Who stalked me my entire junior year. I remember her sister Judy, Who I snuck into the merry-go-round with At Tilden Park. Oh, man, what a party. You hooked up in-- in the merry-go-round? Yeah, I hooked up on the merry-go-round. How could you focus? Weren't you afraid of getting arrested? Wait a minute. You didn't hook up on the merry-go-round? Everybody hooked up on the merry-go-round, Even Adam. What? Okay. Well, my fear of jail Outweighed my desire to hook up in a spinning cup. What are you saying, I squandered my youth? I was just a rule follower? I was just studying for stupid tests? I didn't say that, but I agree with that. I was just saying it was a good place to hook up. Amber's a really good writer. Really? Yeah. You didn't read this? No, I just took the "a" at face value. "the pivotal character, Caddy, is seen "only through the gaze of her brothers "and only in silhouette, "running, vanishing, forever elusive, "forever out of reach, A reflection of their desires." That was nice. Yeah? You like that? Whitman-esque. Yeah. Uh, wait a minute. [pages rustle] This is not Amber's paper. This is my paper from High School. Amber copied my paper! What? [laughing] That's impossible. She got an "A." I copied the same paper three years later. Bitch. Hello! Wake up! Wake up! Look what I found in the attic! Oh, it's my old paper on The Sound and the Fury. Are you kidding me with this? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it's just that The book was so confusing, And I just found that. Oh, no. It was just laying there, And Mr. Cyr is really, really hard. Well, I can only imagine then What his reaction is gonna be When I tell him that you did not write this paper. Wait, what? No, no, no, you can't tell him. Can't you just-- Can't you just punish me, please? No, I can't punish you, Because I ran out of good punishments for you in Fresno. We'll have to see what he comes up with. Good night. Wait! But-- [door slams] Hi there. Hey. Thank you so much. I just needed to, um, talk to you today About Amber's paper. Oh, cool. I'm glad you read it. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I read it. That's one of the most original, Insightful papers I've ever read. Really? Yeah. I mean, what she wrote about, um, Caddy's evolution From a girl who loved climbing trees To promiscuous teen, that was really moving. You didn't find it, uh, over the top or misguided, Like another teacher might? No, no, I mean, I... I love it when my students think outside the box. It's...It's what makes the whole thing worth it. Hmm. That and the free cafeteria food. God, is that good. It's so good. With the ladle? I eat all my food out of ladles. You know, there aren't that many parents That take this kind of interest, So no wonder Amber's so special. She obviously gets it from you. Um...Well, look, uh, College applications are right around the corner, And if, uh... For what it's worth, I'd love to write her a recommendation. I mean, really? Yeah. You think she could go to college? Yeah, no question. Wow. Is there anything else you want to talk to me about? No. Well, nice to see you. Nice to see you. Oh, gosh, I am late for work. Okay. So...I will be going there. I'm a bartender at Whiskey Mike's. And why--why am I telling you that? I guess, you know what? I'm trying to impress you. Uh...It worked. [laughs] okay. I'll see you around, Sarah. I hope so. I mean, okay, bye. Oh, can I try some? Sure, sweetie. Hey, you know what I was thinking? Next time you and Harmony have a play date, You should be the Princess. But I don't even want to be the Princess. Well, you've never tried it. You're gonna love it. And, you know, I bet you Harmony would love to have a little break, too. [sighs] Okay. But I might kind of forget. Why don't we come up with a code word, all right? To help you remember. Okay. Yeah? How about, um... Tiara? Okay. Tiara. Good. Hey, kiddo. What are you reading about? Stink bugs. Great. Well, what do you say we head outside And toss the ball around a little bit? No, thanks. [telephone rings] [rings] Hello. Oh, uh, hey, Adam. It's me, Drew. Oh, Drew. Hi. Hey, um, I just wanted to let you know You left your baseball gear here yesterday, so... Oh, okay. I'll get it next time I come over. Yeah. Uh, well...

Oh, uh, they canceled the session. Yeah, but there's still stuff to do, And you usually stop by, and... I was just sort of noticing That maybe you've been laying a little low Since our visit with Dr. Gerard. Have I? But he kind of freaked me out, too. [laughs] Was it that he wants all three of us To have a kid together? Mm, God, I know. But you know what, I've been thinking, And it's not like three years is that far away. And, you know, we're in a good place, right? Yeah, we are. And I know that's not our deal, Which I will honor. But there's really nothing holding us back From starting right now, so if you're willing, So am I. Well? What did he say? Was he mad? Was he upset? Was he sad? Well, what happened? I didn't tell him. 'cause he's so cool, right? No, not 'cause he's so cool. Because he believes in you, And for some stupid reason, so do I. You better not let us down. I totally won't. You owe me a paper on The Sound and the Fury. Wait. And it better be original and insightful and moving. Hey. Hope you don't mind. I borrowed Drew for a little while. Hey. That's okay. Hey, Drew, we'll see you tomorrow At the ballpark, a little batting practice. Yep. Here. But it's yours. Well, just take good care of it, Keep it oiled. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye, Drew. Thanks. Bye. [whispering] okay, okay, okay. Hey. Hey. Um, Jabbar is actually out at a sleepover Right now. Well, I actually came to talk to you, so... Oh, okay. Um... I want to get a paternity test, You know, for Jabbar. What? Well, I'm just-- I'm trying to make Some big life decisions, and, uh, my little sister, Who acts like she's older than me, but isn't-- Anyway, she's a lawyer, And she says that I should know for sure. So you think I'm lying? No, no, no, no. I just need to know exactly what my, uh... What did she say? Exactly what my responsibilities are, Financially and legally speaking. I didn't introduce you to him To try and hit you up for money Or to pull some scam or whatever it is You and your sister think I'm up to. I just wanted my son to know his father. That's all. Yeah, I don't-- listen, um... This was a mistake. Yeah, it was. Can we just rewind and forget about this conversation? Actually, you just need to go, okay? All right. But, look, Hey, wait. Jabbar and I-- Are Jabbar and I still on for the zoo tomorrow? I don't think so. You don't think so? [door slams] All right, that was... That was great. Haddie: [speaking indistinctly] [giggling] I don't know, it's so random. Hey, Haddie. Mom? What's up? Mom! Whoa! Kristina, lookin' good. Hey, Steve. Um, you know what? Haddie has to log off the computer. Oh, yeah. No problemo. Uh, ttyl. [slams screen] You know the rule. No computer after 10:00. No, actually, you guys said the phone. I don't think that the Braverman Taliban Has outlawed the computer. Okay, whatever. You broke the spirit of the rule, Of the phone, with the computer. Whatever. Haddie, do not walk away from me When I'm talking to you. What's going on? You know what? Maybe you guys could learn A few parenting tips from Steve's parents. Rule number one being Give your kids just a little bit of privacy. Hey, you know what, Haddie? [door closes] You all right? No, I'm not. I hate Steve's parents. I hate them. Yeah. Me, too. Hey, did you talk to Jasmine About the paternity test? Hey. Yeah, I did, and, man, it went great. Good. You want me to set up an appointment With my guy for you and Jabbar? Oh, no, you don't have to go to all that trouble, Because thanks to you Telling me how to live my life, Jasmine now thinks I'm a giant jackass And doesn't want me anywhere near Jabbar. Oh, and Katie's going off the pill tomorrow, too, So that's great news. Wow. Well, I don't know how all of that Is exactly my fault, But don't you think that that's suspicious That Jasmine freaked out when you brought up the test? Yeah, or maybe it's because I basically called her a liar. You just want to know the truth. Yeah, and she said I was the father. And then refused to let you corroborate that. "corroborate"? Did you just really use that word In a normal conversation? Cros, just find something That has Jabbar's DNA on it. Oh, come on. Just--just find a comb With a few strands of hair, A tissue, a cup he drank out of. All right? A sample of saliva or hair, And my guy will run the test. Mm-hmm. And then we know for sure? And then you'll know for sure. And the longer you wait, The harder it's gonna be to find out, No matter which way it goes. [glass clinks] Pot roast. Just so you know... Yeah. Today, on me. Break a decades-old tradition? Why start now? I'm trying to be nice, 'cause you're being so nice about Drew. You kiddin' me? I should be thanking you. He's a great kid. Seriously, thank you. You're welcome. Tell you what, if you really want to thank me, You can help me figure out what to do About yo-yo and Haddie. He's just constantly touching her. Uch. I don't know. Don't ask me. Amber just makes out in a car Like a normal teenager. I swear, this kid's got, like, eight hands. Well, maybe it's a compliment, you know. He's showing you how comfortable he feels around you. Well, that is exactly the opposite Of how I want him to feel. He's like gropey groperson. Hey, maybe the more they do it in public, The less they do it in private. It's just a theory. It's not helping. Hey, where's Crosby? I keep calling him, and he doesn't call me back. I don't know. Just busy doing Crosby stuff, I guess. Like what? There's nothing going on. You're the worst liar. All right, look. This is big news, okay? [gasps] Crosby has a son. Pfft! Shut up. I thought you were actually telling me something. I'm serious. Listen to me. He has a five-year-old boy named Jabbar. There's no way you could make up that name. I'm serious. He has a little boy, okay? Since when? Since five years ago. No, since when have you known? Oh, couple weeks. A couple weeks? Don't make it about the fact That you haven't known until now. How could you keep that from me? You're the worst liar in the family. He asked me not to tell anybody. And you actually did that? I can't believe you've known this. Would you get over it? You know now. Can't believe you didn't tell me. Don't hit me. And I got the organic kiwis. Harmony won't eat the conventionally grown ones. Oh. Pomegranate juice? Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine. Sydney, tiara. [laughs] Um, Harmony? Can I try to be the Princess this time? But I'm always the Princess. But maybe I can try being the Princess this time. Okay. What do you want to do? I don't know. Maybe you want to tell your subjects there's a ball. Um, there's gonna be a ball. I don't want to go to a ball. Balls are boring. Yeah, I thought so, too. Hey, do you know what? I think the Maid's really a queen Who's been working undercover, And now she's staging a coup. How do you know what a coup is? My mom told me that's what happened in Thailand When everyone got tired of the king. She's fascinated by southeast Asia. Oh. She "couped" me, mommy, And I didn't even want to be the Princess! It's okay, sweetie, I know. I know. We can't make our children Into people they're not. Thanks. That's very... Buddhist. [tv playing] Hey, has anybody seen the... The bat? What's up, Adam?

No. What about the can of sperm and Katie? No, you gotta tell her. You're all grown up now. Yeah, there's no canister of sperm anymore. She wants my kid, like, now. Then you're really gonna have to tell her. Mm, I don't know. Crosby, you guys are talking about having a child, And you have one already. You have to tell her. Look, what if I tell her And then she doesn't want anything to do with me? You gotta leave that up to her, you know. You have to do the right thing. I don't really want these anymore. One chocolate with only yellow m&ms;, And one nonfat sugar-free heath bar With extra oreo. Yes, I am fully aware of the irony of my order, honey. Don't make fun. Steve, you're telling me that you seriously Just didn't like the movie? It shouldn't be called love actually. It should be called lame actually. It was just a bunch of people Gazing at each other longingly. It--it was totally romantic. No, it was totally superficial. I can't believe you couldn't see that. I can't believe that you're just being Such a jerk right now. [whispering] hey. Oh, really? I'm a jerk? How am I being a jerk By having my own opinion? My bad. Okay, you know what? Your bad? You can leave. Fine. Fine. [door opens] Haddie? Are you all right? Yeah, um... We're just, um... He--he just... He's just not who I thought he was. [sobbing] Oh, Haddie. [running upstairs] Crap. This might be the best moment of my life. You're rotten. So how did "operation dethrone Harmony" go? It was a disaster. Yeah? Harmony wouldn't abdicate? No, Sydney hated being the Princess. Well, there's nothing wrong With staying a member of the proletariat. It's my fault, too. I made her do it. I'm such a control freak, aren't I? All right, this is where you say, "no, you're not. "you were just trying to teach your daughter To stand up for herself." Does telling me exactly what I should say Make you feel like less of a control freak? All right, fine. Fine. This is who I am. I am going to accept it. I'm a control freak. I don't do anything spontaneous, Like hook up on a merry-go-round in Tilden Park. [laughs] that's still bothering you? Aw, come on! Come on, you're very crazy. You do crazy stuff. I do? Yes, yes. We're very wild. We went on that river rafting trip. Remember, there were rapids? There weren't rapids. There weren't rapids, but there was a current. You know, there was a very strong current. [laughs] I'm gonna go check for a pulse. Come on! No! Co-- We went on a parasailing trip for our honeymoon. That was-- well, I went on it, But you were right on the shore, Cheering me on. [video game laser blasts] No, thanks, I got it. You know, if you're gonna make me read This incomprehensible book, the least you could do Would be to ask Luke Skywalker to turn down the volume! What are you doing here? I thought you were playing ball with Uncle Adam. Yeah, he canceled. I don't know, he had to take Max To get ice cream or something. I don't know. Ice cream? What do you mean? You guys had a plan. Yeah, I don't know. [explosion] [sighs] Well, what about the environmental implications Of dumping this much estrogen into the bay? Don't worry. It's very low dosage. Okay, good-bye to all the devices and barriers And hormones that I've been using all these years To avoid getting pregnant, And hello to-- Cross my fingers, I hope I'm not jinxing anything-- A little mini katie-Crosby being. Uh, listen, before you throw this Into the bay and sterilize all the fish, I gotta tell you something. I have a son. What? I--I have-- I have a son. I had a fling 5 1/2 years ago with his mother, And a month and half ago, She moved back to Berkeley And introduced me to him. His name's Jabbar. Um...Wow. I'm really sorry I didn't tell you about it. You know, I was just trying to get to know him, And I didn't know when the right time-- Was this the little boy that you brought to the studio? Yes, that was him. You didn't introduce him to me. No, I--I did not. I didn't introduce him to you. You know, it was-- it was confusing. Well, I'm sure it was confusing, But you've also been sneaking around And hiding him and--and-- And keeping him from me for over a month. I'm sorry if I didn't tell you right off the bat, But, you know, you've been a little bit psycho With this whole baby thing. Oh, psycho? That's what you call wanting to have a baby is? Because I thought that was something That we both really wanted. I didn't mean to s-- No, you know, I can't keep pushing you. It's not fair to either of us. You can't answer the question why you blew Drew off? Well, it's not that simple, Sarah. It's not that hard, Adam. You said you'd meet him at the baseball diamond, Just meet him at the baseball diamond. Look, at some point in the distant past, I had promised Max That I would take him to Yogurtland this afternoon. I forgot about it, he didn't. And you can't just change plans on Max, Because he falls apart. He's not the only kid Who has been dealt a rough hand. I know. All Drew has done his whole life Is sit around and wait for his father to show up. Wait for him at school, Wait for him after soccer, Wait for him on whole weekends That were his weekends to take them, And he would never show up! And the last thing he needs Is another half-assed father figure! Half-assed-- [groans] I would have loved To have gone to the ballpark this afternoon. It was because of your son That I got to go to the ballpark in the first place. And these last few days have been great, Playing ball with those boys. It was almost like... Max didn't have a "situation." And that is what was so hard about this afternoon. I'm sorry. Last couple of days... It was almost like Drew had a father... Thanks to you. He's a good ballplayer. Really? Mm-hmm. Prepare to be whisked away. Hi, honey. Your mother is watching Sydney tonight. I have a brief due in the morning. Don't worry. I've got it all under control so you don't have to. Oh, boy. Come on. [laughs] They're closed. Yeah, that's the point, Jules. That way we have the whole pool to ourselves. But that's trespassing. Is it? No, I mean, it's a misdemeanor. Oh, my God! They could charge us with breaking and entering. They could. They probably could. We would get into a lot of trouble, wouldn't we? Here, come on. Right there. Come on, Braverman. Oh, my God. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Amber didn't drive you to drink, did she? Oh, no, no. No, not exactly. But, um, I will have a beer. Yeah. Something in an ale? Sure. I'm gonna have to see your I.D., though. Bar policy. Oh, okay. Huh. Oh, really? Please don't hold the eyebrow piercing against me. It was a drunken college dare. 1983. Yep. [clears throat] So, uh, Amber told me about the paper. Oh, she did? I'm really impressed. I couldn't tell you. And her new paper wasn't half bad, either. Doesn't seem like something That came off the Internet, does it? No, no, no, it sounded just like Amber. There's not a lot of downloaded papers That use the word "suck" with such frequency. [chuckles] Wow, that's great. I'm proud of her. Course, it wasn't nearly as captivating And insightful as that first paper. So an eyebrow piercing. Hmm. Hmm. Begs the question, tattoos? No, no tattoos. Hey. Hey. Jabbar left this at my place last time, And I was gonna take it to my sister's DNA guy, But then I thought, Jabbar's oral hygiene Is a lot more important than that, so... I get it. I get it. You know, we don't really know each other very well, And I just dropped this thing Right on your lap. You have every right to want to know for sure. Yeah. I know for sure. I know, But let's just take the test anyway. Let's make your annoying sister happy. That's impossible, but... We can try. We can try. If they prosecute me for trespassing With criminal intent, That's considered a felony. Uh-huh. I could be disbarred. Oh. I don't even want to think About what kind of fine or jail time that entails. I wouldn't. You would have to go back to work. Oh. Which would mean There's no one to watch Sydney, Because I'm in jail. So, um, no. No. No, no, no, no! [giggling] Aah! [laughing] Okay, you n. Chocolate chip pancakes? Mm-hmm. I'm just trying to, you know, cheer Haddie up After everything that happened with Steve yesterday. [cell phone chimes] oh, my God. [giggles] stop. Hmm. Seems to be taking it pretty well. Hey, Haddie. Morning. Hi. Who are you texting? Steve. Hmm? Oh. I know. He totally admitted that he was wrong About love actually. Oh. Really? Mm-hmm. The movie really shut him down Because he's been afraid to care about somebody The way that Mark cares about keira knightley, Like, till now, And he was just masking his vulnerability with cynicism. That's cute. I know. That's cute. He's really sensitive. Oh. That's nice. [cell phone chimes] What'd he say? What? What is it? What's he saying? Nothing. Oh. Huh. All right, well, what are we gonna do about this? Nothing. Nothing? Nothing. It is what it is, And there's nothing we can do about it. Well, can I still hate the guy? [applause] Okay, pay attention, Max. Come on, Max. Max, please. [cheering] Get under it! Come on, Max. Got it! I got it! Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Good grab, Max! Good grab!
