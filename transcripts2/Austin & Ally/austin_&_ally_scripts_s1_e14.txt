 Subs created by: David Coleman. Rise and shine, sleepy heads! We have a big day ahead. The MyTAB 6 goes on sale in only 13 hours. How do you like your eggs? Four hours from now. And scrambled. Why did you have to wake us up at 6:00 A.M.? Everybody else is still sleeping... Even the mall statue guy. I woke you up so we can enjoy this together!

 We're doing this as a team. Right, Trish? Trish? Oh, hey guys. I totally slept here. In fact, I'm sleeping now. I'm sleepwalking. You're also sleep-lying. Fine, I didn't sleep here. Why do we have to wait in this ridiculous line if we're just getting one MyTAB anyway? First of all, because it's fun. Woo! Skip to "second of all." Second of all, MyTAB's are the hottest thing out there.

 If we don't get ours today, it'll be months before Tech Town gets another shipment in. I can't wait months. I really need that new video editing app. I really need the new music recording app. And I really need to re-sell our MyTAB for five times what we pay for it. We're not re-selling it. I hear there's an awesome cloud identifying app. I'm gonna be the coolest girl in my cloud watching club! If you really wanna be cool, never mention cloud watching club again. If all we're gonna do is wait in this line, can't we go back to sleep? No, because in exactly five seconds, it's officially Owen's birthday! Happy Birthday, Owen! Or should I say "bird-thday"? You should say "birthday." I can't believe you brought Owen to wait in line with us. He can keep us company and tell us stories. Don't you, Owen? Come on, like we practiced. "Ally's cool, Ally's cool." Maybe he can talk but he just can't tell a lie. When the crowd wants more, I bring on the thunder. 'Cause you've got my back, and I'm not going under. You're my point, you're my guard. You're the perfect chord. And I see our names together on every billboard. We're headed for the top, we've got it on lock. We'll make 'em say "hey!" And we'll keep rockin'. Oh, there's no way I could make it without ya. Do it without ya, be here without ya. It's no fun when you're doing it solo. With you it's like, "whoa,". Yeah, and I know. I own this dream. 'Cause I got you with me. There's no way I could make it without ya. Do it without ya, be here without ya. And that's your last birthday present, Owen. Sorry I didn't get you a lot this year. Didn't get him a lot?! We've been watching you open bird presents for three hours. Uh-oh, Dez, here comes Mindy. Oh no! She has a crush on me. - Hide me! - I'll hide you. Okay... Ooh! Hey, Dezzy-cakes. Did you get my flowers? You sent me flowers? No! Did you get me... My flowers? Aw... Thank you. Uh, Mindy, you can't cut in line. No cutsies. But she was just saving my space. Also no savesies. Sorry. - Oh. - Back of the line. Okay, I don't know why you're so mean to me, because I am always so nice to you. Would you shut your stupid bird up?! I'll have you know my bird is not stupid. He talks a lot. Well, I wonder where he gets that from. Arr, ye bird is so loud! Me bird's been here all night, she hasn't made a peep. Pirate Frank, your bird's not real. Aw, my Dad just texted. He wants me to watch the store today. Don't worry. We can keep waiting in line and you can meet us later. I'm going with Ally. I'm tired from hanging out here all night. You weren't here all night. Okay, I'm just tired of hanging out with you. I don't know about leaving you guys in line alone. Can I trust you to hold our place? Can she trust us?! Ally, please. It's not that hard to stand in line. Yeah, the key is to stay focused. Hey, is that a balloon? You can trust us. Attention everyone! I am leaving the line, but my friends are holding my space. However, since we are only buying one MyTAB, this is not a violation of the no-savesies rule. - In addition... - No one cares. Leave already! What's with the popcorn machine? My Dad found it in the dumpster behind the movie theater. He's giving it to Owen for his birthday. Owen loves popcorn. Did Owen tell you that? I wish I didn't have to work today. I need to be in that line. Relax. It's not like Dez is there by himself. Austin is with him, and Austin would never leave the line. Hey, guys! I left the line. Why? I needed a break. You left Dez there by himself? Ally, it's only been five minutes. You think Dez is just gonna let people go in front of him? You can cut in front of me. I insist, I insist. Go. Hey Bill. Oh actually, it's Billl with three "L" s. Right, sorry, Billl. It's "alll" good. Why'd you let those people cut in front of you? They had a really sad story about why they needed a MyTAB. Dude, they so took advantage of your kindness. On a totally unrelated note... If I don't get a MyTAB, my girlfriend's gonna break up with me. - That's terrible. - Yeah. If she breaks up with me, I'lll be all... ll... ll... ll... ll... ll... - All what?! - All sad. I don't want you to lose your girlfriend. You can cut in front of me. Oh thanks, buddy! Hey, Ally. Dez, what happened? You're like 20 spaces behind where we were. I knew I couldn't trust you. I had to let those people cut in front of me. They all had such sad stories. Seriously? You let statue guy cut in front of you? He doesn't even speak. - He gave me a really sad face. - Huh. Ally didn't trust me to stand in line, so she sent me back here to help you watch the store. What are you doing? Ally asked me to feed Owen. She sent me like 20 pages of bird feeding rules. She doesn't trust us to do anything. That's probably her texting me again. Here. Sorry, buddy. "P.S. When you feed Owen, do not open the cage." Hmm. "And do not leave the window open." Owen! Owen, come back! Ally's gonna freak. We have to find him before she finds out. I know some bird calls. This is my Cockatiel. I think that was a chicken call. No, I ordered from the chicken hut earlier. I was starving. Thank you, or should I say brawk! Austin! You left Dez alone in the store? No, he's not alone. Because Owen's there! In his closed cage where he belongs. - Oh, is that Ally's... - Nose? Yep, that's Ally's nose. Boop! Don't boop my nose. Well, I'm gonna run off that way. He was acting weird. Yeah! The way he ran off that way? That was weird. Well, I'm gonna run off that way. Pretty bird! Owen's a pretty bird. - You found Owen?! - Nope. But I built a new Owen. Ally will never know the difference. Yeah, this looks exactly like him. Except for the candy corn beak. Let's see how he flies. He can't fly... He's fake. How could you guys let the bird get away? If Ally finds out, it'll destroy her. We have to get Ally's bird back. Let's all think. Okay, Ally says Owen loves popcorn, right? Let's set up a trail of popcorn to lure Owen back to his cage. - Yes! - There you go. Let's do it. Okay. I know. Aren't you putting in a little too much? I'm sorry, who here was fired from a popcorn store? That's what I thought. In the meantime, let's keep looking. Where do ye think ye be going? Uh, that's my spot. You got out of line. She got out of line! But I just... No savesies, no cutsies, no insies, no outsies. Your rules, bird girl. I wasn't really outsie. I was just throwing my apple away. Littering rules take precedence over line rules. Oh. Not according to this 20-page document you handed out. Why am I so thorough? Back of the line, All-ly. Back of the line! Back of the line! Back of the line! Back of the line! - Really? - Back of the line! Back of the line! Owen! Owen! Get your "Owen" popcorn, Austin. This popcorn's "my-en." Ally, what are you doing here? I got booted to the back of the line. Now there's too many people. We'll never get a MyTAB. - I really messed up. - People mess up. - That's okay. - It... It's not. I gave you guys a hard time about being irresponsible, and now we're not getting a MyTAB because of me. Ally, you made a mistake. What are friends for, if not for understanding each others' mistakes? And immediately forgiving them? We know you'd do the same if we ever made a mistake, and you'd be just as understanding, if not... More. Okay, what's going on? Nothing. Why are you both talking at the same time? We're not. Why'd you both look upstairs? We didn't! Hey, Ally. What happened in here? That popcorn machine your Dad found in the dumpster is broken. It won't turn off. I've tried everything. Okay, maybe not everything. So this is what you guys were trying to hide from me? Actually no. There's something way worse we need to talk to you about. Uh, what's worse than this? Uh, nothing. It could've been worse. Birds could've flown away! Why would I say that? You know what? We're gonna get our MyTAB. I didn't sleep on the mall floor all night just to give up this easy. You didn't sleep on the mall floor all night. How are we gonna get our MyTAB if we have to start at the back of the line? Since we can't move up in the line, we're gonna have to figure out ways to get people to move out of line. We're also gonna have to figure out ways to get rid of all this popcorn. There's only one way to get rid of all this popcorn. Dez, that's gonna take way too long. Let me help you. Whoa! - This is the best day ever! - I know! I hope this works. If there's one thing people like more than a MyTAB, it's a free MyTAB. Hey, everybody, I just got a job at Tech Town and... Good news... We're giving away a free MyTAB! All you gotta do is find a golden horseshoe hidden somewhere in this mall. Oh, you heard me... A free MyTAB. They're totally gonna fall for it. Then we'll steal their spots in line. Suckers! Oops. Did you guys hear about that weather report? A freak storm is about to hit Miami. Everyone should evacuate. They say there's going to be golf-ball size hail. - Evacuate! - Evacuate, evacuate! Evacuate! I couldn't find hail the size of golf balls, so I just got cheese balls. We were so starving, we were about to give up our spaces to get some food. Now we don't have to, because it's raining sky cheese! The MyTAB's are going on sale in five minutes. What are we gonna do? Austin, grab your guitar. I know one thing people want even more than a MyTAB. Bacon ice cream. No, people wanna see Austin in concert. Oh, that's a great idea, Ally. Yeah. Hey, everybody! I'm playing my first ever acoustic show, and it's free! Follow me. Out of the way move move! It worked! Let's go get that MyTAB. Okay, you go get that MyTAB, I'm gonna go see Austin Moon's first ever acoustic concert. Woo! Well, it looks like it's just you and me getting the MyTAB, Trish. Looks like it's just me. Boop! This next song is called "Not A Love Song." You're always on my mind. I think about you all the time... Um, no. Let's not talk about it. Drama, we can live without it. Catch wave if we're bored, there's a clock we'll ignore. Find a way around it. Girl, I can tell it's something. Even when you say it's nothing. When you're playing with your hair like you just don't care. It's a tell, you're bluffing... Please don't take this the wrong way. I love the things you do, it's how you do the things you love. But it's not a love song. Not a love song. I love the way you get me, but correct me if I'm wrong. This is not a love song. Not a love song. I love the things you do, it's how you do the things you love. The way you say it, put me through it. I guess I always knew it. I love the way you get me, but correct me if I'm wrong. This is not a love song. Not a love song. Did you get it? No, they were all sold out. - Oh seriously? - No way! Oh man! Kidding! Awesome! Whoa! It's even cooler than I thought! Oh, it was so worth waiting all night. You didn't wait all night. And the best part is it's ours forever. It's mine now. I found the golden horseshoe! Dez, you actually hid a golden horseshoe? Well, yeah-huh. A Tech Town employee never lies. You don't really work at Tech Town. Dez, do something. Okay okay. Uh... Hey, Mindy, how about I take you on a date and you give us back the MyTAB? How about you take me on a date and I keep the MyTAB? Awesome. Wait. Oh man! See you Friday night, Dezzy-cakes. - Ooh, I actually have plans... - I said Friday night! Pick you up at 8:00. So Owen, did you have a nice birthday? Give it up, Ally. The bird's never gonna talk. Austin let me of the cage. Trish and Dez knew about it. Wait, there's more. Dez touched your song book. Don't listen to Owen he doesn't know what he's talking about. I tried to find you earlier, but I got lost in the food court. Then I pooped on a statue. It turned out to be a real guy. Wait, there's more.
