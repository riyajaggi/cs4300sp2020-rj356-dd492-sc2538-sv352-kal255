 Subs created by: David Coleman. Um, guys, what are you doing? Building the first ever musical instrument domino course. Hit it, Austin. Well, that stunk. What? That was amazing! Yeah. I gotta admit that was pretty cool. No, wasn't. At the end, pudding was supposed to explode out of the tuba. What's the point of knocking over all these instruments, if there's no pudding explosion? Ooh!

 Guess who got a job at... You got a job at... What kind of place is that? No, I got a job at the sausage cart. I said... Because of that guy over there. I'm pretty sure that's Jimmy Starr. He owns Starr Records. No way. He's one of the biggest names in music! - I'm gonna get a better look. - No, don't make it obvious. Ally, please. Jimmy Starr! It's him.

 No way. I've been giving his son violin lessons for weeks. I had no idea. This is huge. Your best shot at a record deal is sitting right over there. You know what you need to do, right? Oh, yeah. I'll keep giving his son lessons each week, dropping very subtle hints about Austin's music. Then in four to five months... No, we're doing this now. Jimmy baby, how the heck are ya? Let's start with "who the heck are you?" You know... Trish. We met at that thing. I'm pretty sure I'd remember talking to a sausage. Okay, we've never met, but I know who you are. Oh, I've heard of you. My son's a fan. What are you working on now? Well, we just started writing this new song called "The Way That You Do." Ah. Tell you what... I'll be back next week for my son's lesson. Have a demo of that song ready. If I like it, you might just have yourselves a record deal. - Awesome! - Oh! - I'm gonna get a record deal! - What up? I said "might" and "if." What up? I have a great feeling about this. You're a Starr. Austin's a Moon. Together, you'll rule the galaxy. I'm gonna stand over here where I can't embarrass myself. Fixed it! Woo! When the crowd wants more, I bring on the thunder. 'Cause you've got my back, and I'm not going under. You're my point, you're my guard. You're the perfect chord. And I see our names together on every billboard. We're headed for the top, we've got it on lock. We'll make 'em say "hey!" And we'll keep rockin'. Oh, there's no way I could make it without ya. Do it without ya, be here without ya. It's no fun when you're doing it solo. With you it's like, "whoa". Yeah, and I know. I own this dream. 'Cause I got you with me. There's no way I could make it without ya. Do it without ya, be here without ya. No, oh oh oh oh. The way that you do. You're off the charts. You're ♪1. You've got the fire, so keep burning it up! Woo! I nailed the bridge that time. That was great! One more time and I think it'll be perfect. But we've been here for hours and my throat's killing me. I know you're working hard, but this demo has to be perfect for Jimmy Starr. Hey, he's not the only one who's been working hard. I've been slaving over these cover designs all night for Austin. My name's not on that. Okay, that's why we have options. I've been working hard too. I've been glued to this sound board all night. I have no idea how this happened. Come on. We're in the zone. You know what they say... "Once that bacon gets grooving, there's just no stopping that sizzle." Pretty sure you're the only one that says that. All right, fine. One more time and we'll call it quits. Dez, hit record. Recording! You're off the charts, you're ♪1. You've got the fire. So keep burning it u... So keep burning it u... Burning it u... I think something's wrong. Uh, yeah. It's supposed to be... Burning it up! And you're going... Burning it u... No, there's something wrong with my voice. - I... I can't hit that note. - Yeah, you're telling me. Okay, nobody panic. I'm sure Austin will be able to hit the note in the morning. All you need is a good night's sleep. So keep burning it u... Okay, maybe two good nights. What's going on? I used to be able to hit that note in my sleep. Oh, you sleep sing? I sleep paint. Whipped up this little puppy last night. I can't believe this is happening now. Jimmy Starr's coming in a week. Austin, relax. So what if we don't have a finished song for him? That just means we'll lose the best chance we'll ever have of getting a record deal. How that supposed to make me relax? I don't know. I'm not good at this. We should call your parents. You need to go to the doctor. Wait! Before we go to the doctor, there's something I wanna try first. It's lemon, garlic, beet root, three blades of grass, fish oil, chicken liver and one cup of mud. How's that gonna help my throat? It's not. It's just something I've always wanted to try. Yep, I was right! It's disgusting. I hate doctors' offices. They always creep me out. What if there's something really wrong with my voice? Don't worry, Austin. I'm sure everything's gonna be fine. I remember when I was six I took my pet goldfish Moby to the vet, and he was nervous too. And everything turned out fine? No, we had to flush him. Why do I keep trying to cheer you up? Hey, we got you some tea with honey. For my honey. - Thanks, mom. - Yeah. So did they come back with the test results yet? - No, we're still waiting. - The service here stinks. You know, at our mattress store, we get you in, we get you out, and we get you sleeping in no time. Because... At Moon's Mattress Kingdom, there's no hassle in our Castle. Mwah. Thanks for your patience, folks. Give it to us straight, doc. We can take it. Well, we ran some tests... No! I haven't given the results yet. Oh. Proceed. Well, it looks like Austin here has nodules on his vocal chords. Nodules? Not nodules! What are nodules? Don't worry. It's not that serious. But if left untreated, it could prevent you from ever singing again. - What? - That's terrible. Oh, I see. And how will it affect his dancing? Does he have to be in here? Welcome to my world, doc. What kind of treatment options are there, doctor? Well, there's a very simple procedure that can cure Austin completely. And it has a quick recovery time, so you could be singing again in less than a week... See? I told you there was nothing to worry about. But there are some possible side effects. See? I told you there was something to worry about. What are the side effects? Well, there's a chance with the procedure... That Austin's voice may be permanently altered. Wait. If I don't have the procedure, I may never sing again. But if I do, I may never sing the same again? That's correct. Remind me again, doc... Where did we land on the dancing? Seriously, you need to leave. Hey, Austin. We feel bad about what you're going through, so we got you some gifts. I knitted you a scarf with all our names on it. - Thanks. - I got you a giant get-well-soon card. And I'm gonna sign the giant get-well-soon card, because I didn't know we were doing gifts. Thanks, guys. We're really sorry we pushed you so hard. We feel like it's our fault your voice is damaged. Don't feel bad. It's not your fault. I know. That's why I didn't get you anything. I just don't know what to do about this procedure. Oh, it's a tough decision. Let's make a pros and cons list. Oh! I love pros and cons lists. You wanna know why? Pro... They make decisions easier. Con... There isn't one! I love them! Okay, Austin, go ahead. Well, pro... With the procedure, I'll be able to sing again. Con... With the side effects, I may end up sounding like a chipmunk. Or a bottle-nosed dolphin. Dez... He's not going to sound like a dolphin. Uh, we don't know that. I mean, I don't wanna worry you, but you could sound like anything. I'm not worried. Hey, everybody. Thanks for coming out. This song is called... "Break Down The Walls." Break down the walls, whoa! Don't be afraid to let things fall... Looks like we're having some technical difficulties. Let me try one more time. Boo! Boo! Boo! I don't wanna sound like a dolphin! What should I do? This is the toughest decision I've ever had to make. Decisions are easy... Just flip a coin. Let's see. I've got a quarter, a nickel and a dime. Which one should I flip? Man! Decisions are hard to make. Forget it, Dez. We should probably call Jimmy Starr, and tell him we need a little more time to finish our demo. Okay, I'll handle it. I'm your manager. It's my job to make your life easier. Jimmy baby, it's Trish. Listen, we're gonna need a little more time with that demo. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Perfect! - Yes! - So we got more time? Actually, no. He wants it a day earlier. I know you got your heart set on a music career, kiddo, but you ought a take this throat thing as a sign. Yeah, sweetie. Look, we love your music, but why take a risk when you've got a sure thing in the family business? I don't wanna spend my life selling mattresses. Don't you wanna be part of a legacy? Your mother and I are the mattress King and Queen of Miami. - You know what that makes you? - Embarrassed? You're the Prince of Moon's Mattress Kingdom, and one day - that kingdom will be yours to rule. - Mm-hmm. But in a few days, he could have a deal at Starr Records. Yeah, I'm so close, and performing's my dream. You get that from me. I love to perform too. - It's true, you do. You do. - And you still get to do that in our job. - Have you seen our latest commercial? - Right. Come on down to Moon's Mattress Kingdom. Where our mattresses are firm and our prices are soft. This week we hereby declare all mattresses half off. Huh? Come on, son. Say the slogan with us. - I don't really want to. - Oh, come on, Prince Austin. Moon's Mattress Kingdom. There's no hassle in our Castle. Mwah! Well, son, you've got a lot to think about. Yeah, we'll see you at home, sweetie. You look so cute in your little crown. Your highness. Hello. I'm doing the procedure. Are you sure? Yeah, I don't want to be the mattress Prince, and singing's my life. What if the procedure doesn't work? This could end your career. Then either way my career's over. I can't believe I might never sing again. I made up my mind. I have to take this chance. I don't know what I would do if I couldn't sing the songs you write for me. Thanks, Austin. I'm gonna go call Dr. Grant. 'Ello, I'm Princess Ally. Oh, of course I'll kiss you, Mr. Frog. - Ally! - Uh, coming. Oh, I can't wait to see Austin. It's been two days since his procedure. Dez, are you almost done with those balloons? Yup, I just blew up 100 balloons. Now all I gotta do is tie 'em. Austin, welcome back! Welcome back, buddy. What do you think of the decorations? Fine. Really, the silent treatment? I just almost sorta nearly blew up 100 balloons for you. Pf ft! No, the doctor put Austin under strict vocal rest to make sure his throat heals properly. He has to remain silent for 48 hours. Only 12 more to go. The doctor says it's crucial that Austin doesn't say a word. Got it. What word? He can't say anything. Got it. He can't say the word "anything." Well, that shouldn't be too hard. He can't speak at all. Maybe you should try that. I know you can't talk, buddy, so I came up with a foolproof communication system using these colored scarves. It's easy. Just wave the blue scarf if you're thirsty. The green is to signal danger. The red... Oh, wait. No, the red is to signal danger. The green is if you spot a snake. Or was that the purple? Anyway, the pink is if you're late for prom. Put all three of these together if you need a coffee. Yellow? There's a spider on your shirt?! I'll get it. I'm gonna get you, buddy. I'm gonna help you. I'm helping you. I know spiders are dangerous. Just let me help you. Come on. It's okay. It's okay. Where is it? Where is it? I brought you some hot soup to make your throat feel better. You're doing great. You only have to be quiet for six more hours. How hard can that be? It's okay. I'll scream for you. "That girl is checking me out. Help me." Oh, I got you. I'll take care of it. Quit staring at my friend! You're freaking him out! You're welcome. I wonder if I could not talk for 48 hours. Granted, I'm not much of a talker. Sure, I talk sometimes. I'm not not a talker, but when I do... Yeah, I couldn't do it. Only a few hours left. I can't believe you went two whole days without saying a word. That's why you're my best friend. What up? Austin, you talked. I wasn't thinking. But the 48 hours aren't up yet. Do you think you ruined your voice? - I don't know. - Why do you keep talking?! Because you keep asking me questions! Let's all stop talking. We'll keep Austin quiet for a couple more hours, we'll record the demo and by the time Jimmy gets here, we'll be... Uh, guys. Change of plans, kids. I'm catching a plane in an hour, so I wanted to pop by and get that demo a little early. Look over there! Run! That's all I got. Somebody else got a plan? Look, Mr. Starr, I hate to say this, but we don't have your demo. We thought we'd have a couple more hours to finish it. Oh, that's too bad. I don't have a couple more hours. Guess I won't be signing you after all. Mr. Starr, wait, don't leave. - I'm gonna perform the song live. - What? - Huh? - Cool. That works. All right, just make it fast. Give us five minutes. We'll be ready. Dez, you know what to do. Yes. Yes, I do. What are you doing? You haven't had a chance to test out your voice. What if you permanently damaged it? What if you can't hit the notes? Well, we're about to find out. Hit it, Dez. Sometimes it feels like you lost your swag. You've got a "kick me" sign covering the skills that you have. And it all looks wrong when you're looking down. You get dizzy doing 360s. And you can't break out. Even when you feel like you ain't all that. Just don't forget that I got your back. Now turn up the beat and bump that track. Bump that track. Yeah, nobody rocks it the way that you do. You've got style, pop your collar. Because you're all kinds of cool. You're legit, you're the boss. Even when the mic is off. Nobody rocks it, ro-rocks it. The way that you do. No, oh oh oh oh. The way that you do. You're off the charts... - Here comes the high note. - Shh! Austin's singing. You've got the fire so keep burning it... Up! Nobody rocks it the way that you do. You've got style, pop your collar. Because you're all kinds of cool. You're legit, you're the boss. Even when the mic is off. Nobody rocks it, ro-rocks it. The way that you do. Austin Moon, I've been in this business a long time and talent like yours doesn't come around every day. How would you like a contract with Starr Records? Well, I'll take that as a yes? Yes! Then you have yourself a deal. - Woo-hoo! - We always knew this day would come. That's why we got you a giant congratulations card. And once again, no one told me we were getting anything for you. Hmm. Mint? Come on down to Moon's Mattress Kingdom. Where our mattresses are firm and our prices are soft. This week we hereby declare all mattresses... Half off. Our prices are the best in town. But don't take it from us. Take it from Starr Records recording artist... Austin Moon. Yup, their prices are the best in town. So come on down to Moon's Mattress Kingdom. There's no hassle in our Castle. Mwah. Oh, that's my little Prince. Mom!
