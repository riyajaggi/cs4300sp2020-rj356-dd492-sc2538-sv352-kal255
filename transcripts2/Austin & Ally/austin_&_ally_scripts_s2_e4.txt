 Austin & Ally (2011â€“2016): Season 2, Episode 4 - Parents & Punishments - full transcript 
 When Austin's musical ambitions take precedent over his school work, his parents decide to ground him. Meanwhile Ally tries to help a down on their luck music club which incorrectly assumes they can borrow the instruments at Sonic Boom indefinitely, while Cheetah Beat kid-reporter Megan Simms publicizes the incident as a noble gesture. Now Ally tries to organize a fund-raiser to help the kids buy the instruments they borrowed with the promise of a performance by Austin, which is a promise that may be difficult to deliver.

 Subs created by: David Coleman. Megan, it's so cool you're doing an article on Ally. Your "hot new celeb" issue of "Cheetah Beat" was so popular, readers wanted Megan to do a follow up. Everyone wants to know about Austin's amaze songwriter. Oh. First question for everybody. Describe Ally in one word. - Talented. - Amaze. Girl. Oh!

 Hey Nelson, Mrs. Ingram. You brought the whole class today. You ready for your big concert this weekend? I'm afraid we bring very sad news. The band room flooded and ruined all the instruments. - Terrible. - Awful. I'll never smile again. Hubba hubba. Hi, cutie. I'm Nelson. I'm flattered. But my career comes first. So, Ally. We were hoping Sonic Boom could donate some instruments to replace the ones we lost. Honey.

 Hang on a sec. I am off to Tampa for my buddy's wedding. Dad, before you go, do you think we could donate some instruments to the school? All of theirs got ruined. Oh, honey. Nothing would make me happier than to give these kids instruments. Except of course, selling them to paying customers. In fact, let's do that. Let's keep them and sell them! See you. I'm so sorry. But I can't donate any instruments. Oh. This is horribly disappointing. Come on, kids. Let's go cancel the concert. Aw. I wish I could help them. Wait! What if I just let the band borrow the instruments? Great idea! They can play their concert and give the instruments back before your Dad gets home. Nelson! Wait. You can have the instruments, but... Have the instruments?! Hey, everybody! Ally's going to give us the instruments! Take what you want! No. Ally, thank you for giving us these instruments, and letting us keep them forever. You saved our music program. Um... but I... um... um... Um, no. Oh, wait. Uh, no no no. Not the guitars. That was so epic! Ally, you're like the biggest hero... Ever. I'm totes putting that in my article. Um... Not the piano! Did I just give away the whole store? Yep. Pretty much. Hey, we still have this kazoo. Hey, guys! You forgot this kazoo! Nelson! When the crowd wants more, I bring on the thunder. 'Cause you've got my back, and I'm not going under. You're my point, you're my guard. You're the perfect chord. And I see our names together on every billboard. We're headed for the top, we've got it on lock. We'll make 'em say "hey!" And we'll keep rockin'. Oh, there's no way I could make it without ya. Do it without ya, be here without ya. It's no fun when you're doing it solo. With you it's like, "whoa". Yeah, and I know. I own this dream. 'Cause I got you with me. There's no way I could make it without ya. Do it without ya, be here without ya. How are we gonna come up with $10,000 to pay for the instruments? Why don't you just tell Mrs. Ingram you didn't mean to give them to her. It's too late. Megan already posted on the "Cheetah Beat" website that I saved their music program. I'm a hero. I have an idea. Why don't we just hold a fundraiser and say it's for the music program? People love to donate money to needy brats. But wouldn't that be dishonest? The money would go to Sonic Boom not the brats. I mean, kids. So? Instead of raising money to buy instruments, we're raising money to pay for instruments you stupidly gave away. Same thing, different order. We'll stream the fundraiser live so people can donate online. And I can perform. Austin! That would bring in a ton of donations. It would totally save me. Thank you! You know I'd always help you. Oh! Grade alert. Our test scores are posted. I got an "A". Aw, where's my plus? Oh, there it is. I had my thumb over it. Ooh! I got a "B"! My guessing system's getting better. I got a "C"! Aw, where's my minus? Oh wait, there it is. I had my thumb over it. Aw man. I got a "D". Austin, that's your second bad grade in a row. Didn't your parents warn you about that? I know. It's just with rehearsals and dance practice, I haven't had time to study. We have another test tomorrow. You'd better get a good grade on it or your parents are gonna ground you. Trust me, Ally. There's no way I'm getting another bad grade. You got another bad grade?! I was gonna study, but I had to rehearse with my band. You're spending too much time on music and not enough time on school. But my career is just taking off. You want me to quit my music?! No. In fact, we're very proud of you. You are blowing up as the kids say. We even get alerts when there's a new post on your fan page. There's one now. "My parents are lecturing me. Bummer". We're not lecturing you. We're saying you need an education. Look at me. When my career as a hand model ended, I thankfully had my business degree to fall back on. And now, we're the proud owners of Moon's Mattress Kingdom. See that? Looks at your Mom's hands. She's still got it! - Careful. - Sorry. Mom, Dad. I promise from now on, I'll take school more seriously. I'm sure you will. Because you're grounded. What?! You're not leaving this house until your grades improve. But I promised Ally I'd perform at her fundraiser. She's counting on me. You should have thought about that before you put music ahead of school. And it also means no pancakes. Whoa whoa whoa. Let's not get crazy. Hey, it's for your own good. These are really good. Bummer, man. No pancakes and no fundraiser? Ally's gonna be devastated. - How am I gonna tell her? - Just come right out and say it. Ally, I am truly deeply sorry... But my parents won't let me have pancakes. - Grounded? What am I gonna do now? - I'm sorry. I was counting on you to play the fundraiser. How could you do this? Hey, blame my parents. I didn't ground myself. But you're the one who didn't study. Well you're the one who gave away all the instruments. That's because I'm a hero. It says so in "Cheetah Beat". I'm a hero. Yeah, well "Cheetah Beat" also said that striped pants are hot, and they're not! Sorry, Dez. So Austin's not gonna perform? He was my only chance. Now what am I gonna do? Don't worry. We know two performers who are totally gonna save you. - Really?! - Yeah. I'm gonna tap dance! And I'm gonna perform my one-woman play. "You're hired, you're fired... The Trish De La Rosa story". Oh, great. I'm saved. Nailed it! Woo! Let's hear it for Nelson. Woo! For the record, I teach him piano, not violin. Don't forget you can donate online. Now let's look at our new total. How is that even possible? I'm guessing after Nelson, people wanted refunds. You've had your turn, Nelson. Up next, we have... "You're hired, you're fired... the Trish De La Rosa story". You won't want be wanting refunds after this. I hope. Nelson? Get off the stage. Never! Nelson, get off the... I want to play another song. Hey, Austin. I hope you're calling to donate because it is not going well. I know. I'm watching the Webcast. I still feel bad about what happened. I really wish I could help. So do I. Hey, Sweetie. We're going out for the night. We trust you'll be here studying when we get back. Don't worry. It's just me and my books. That's the spirit. Love you. Nope, Mr. Jones. I don't have any experience in construction. What the hey, you're hired. Aw, what do you mean I can't nap and operate the wrecking ball? Even though it's completely unfair, I'm an unreasonable jerk. You're fired. Bravo bravo bravo! Oh! Give it up for Trish. But I still have 15 more jobs to get fired from. It's Dez's turn. Oh! Dez, you're on. Yes! I've waited my whole life for this. Woo. - Hi, honey. - Oh! Dad? Why are you back so early? I misread the invitation. Turns out the wedding is next week. And I'm not invited. - What's going on here? - Uh, I'm... Doing a fundraiser for the kids' music program. Then they can buy instruments from us. Good thinking. - I'll head back to the store now. - No! I mean... Don't you want to see the next act? Dez is gonna tap dance. - Definitely not. - Um wait, wait... Ally! I'm here to perform. Ooh. I'll stick around for that. Great. Hang out awhile. - I thought you were grounded? - I snuck out. Couldn't let you down. Aw. Dez, get off the stage! - But I've waited my whole life... - I said get off the stage. I can wait longer. We have a very special surprise for you... May I present Austin Moon... 'S parents. Ah! Moons! Get on up here. Now, what are you doing here? Well, we felt bad that Austin couldn't come, so we wanted to show our support. We're Mike and Mimi Moon. Proud owners of Moon's Mattress Kingdom. There's no hassle in our castle. And on behalf of Moon's Mattress Kingdom, we wanted to present you with this huge check. Oh. That is a huge check! Woo! For... $10,000?! I'm speechless. Whoops. Decimal's in the wrong place. It's supposed to say $100. It's been kind of slow at the mattress store. Sleeping bags are killing us. Still very generous. Woo. Excuse me a sec. Guys, I need your help. All I gotta do is keep Austin's parents away from Austin, Austin away from his parents, my Dad away from Sonic Boom, and since he knows Austin's here, my Dad away from Austin's parents, and Austin's parents away from my Dad. Got it? Good. Gotta go. Ah! Mr. and Mrs. Moon, your donation of $100, gets you a VIP performance in the Sonic Boom. It starts now. Go! - Let's say hi to Lester first. - Uh, you can't. I mean... Mr. Dawson doesn't want to talk to you. He actually doesn't even like you. He thinks you sell lousy mattresses. Sorry. Lousy? Our mattresses contain only the finest foams and fibers. And to think, we've been so nice to that man. Dez, go give them the VIP performance. Finally! You are in for a treat. And now for our special special surprise. The son of Austin Moon's parents. Austin Moon! I'm happy to be here for a great cause. Don't forget to donate. Sometimes I get in my own way. I need someone to say "hey". What are you thinking. Your words. They're always just in time. Just like a perfect rhyme. Like you're not even trying. Like pieces of a puzzle. Without each other. We're in trouble, trouble. Hey, I will always... I think we've had enough of the VIP treatment. We're gonna head back to the fundraiser. Wait! I have a question for you. Oh, what is it, Sweetie? Well... No, I can't ask you guys this. Nonsense. You can ask us anything, Dez. Okay. I'll just come out and say it. Where do mattresses come from? - Do you want to tell him? - No, you should. You should. - Let's tell him together. - Okay. It's a fascinating story and, I think you're old enough. Have a seat. The first caveman slept on a rock. - And it wasn't that comfortable. - No. Beat beat beat beating like. I can get your heartbeat beating like that. You know you got my heart beat beat beat. Beating like hey hey. Hey hey. I can get your heartbeat beat beat beating like. I can get your heartbeat beating like that. You know you got my heart beat beat beat. Beating like hey hey. Hey hey... - We did it, Ally! We raised the money! - Oh, thank you thank you thank you. Ally. I heard about the fundraiser. First the instruments, and now you've raised $10,000 for our music program. Are there now limits to your generosity? What? No. Actually there are limits. Omg. You are totes heroic. Megan, I am not totes heroic. And totes humble too. This is so going on the "Cheetah Beat" website. Did I just give away $10,000? Yep. Pretty much. I am gonna be in so much trouble. I'm gonna be in trouble too if my parents see me. I gotta get out of here. - Guys! I have to tell you something. - My parents are on their way back? Yeah, but that's not it. Did you know the first waterbeds were invented by Vikings? - That is so not true. - Here they come! Hey, you two. Dez, want to hear about the history of bunk beds? - Do I?! - Dez! But not right now. Megan! Why don't you come take some more photos of Austin's parents? Oh. Totes fantast. You need extreme close-up photos. Let me do it. - Oh. - Oh, whoa. Hey, that's bright. Okay. - Ah. - Good job. Well, as soon as my vision comes back, I think we'll just pick up dinner and take it home to Austin. Yeah. He stayed home and studied all night. - It's the least we could do. - Watch out for the spots, honey. Okay. That was way too close. Austin almost got caught. I know. But if he beats his parents home, they'll never know he was here. Austin rocked. Oh, there's Mike and Mimi, I better go tell them how great their son was. You can't! I mean, they don't want to talk to you. Actually, they don't even like you. They think you sell lousy instruments. - Sorry. - Lousy?! And to think, I have been so nice to those people. Humph. Your Dad's heading back to Sonic Boom. Do you want me to stop him? What's the point? There's no way to hide what happened anymore. - I'm gonna go talk to my Dad. - Well, what about Austin? You gotta buy him some time. His parents are driving home and he's running. I don't want Austin to get in trouble like me. Kids! Let's all think the moons for their donation. Group hug! Watch the hands. Hey, that's my wallet. All right. I can feel your heart beat beat beat beating and... Heyo, heyo. Heyo, heyo... I can feel your heart beat... Aah! What the...? We've been robbed. Oh! No, Dad. That's not what happened. You sold all the instruments? Great! - No, I gave them all away. - Oh. But then I raised $10,000 to pay for them. - Great! - Then I gave that away too. Oh. All right, I can't take this anymore. Please tell me this story has a happy ending. The kids have new instruments, and enough money to keep the program going for years? I meant a happy ending for me! I'm really sorry, Dad. You... Are in big trouble. I'm gonna have to punish you. I am... I'm... You've never done anything wrong before, I'm not really sure what to do. - I'll help you think of something. - Oh, thank you. - Oh, that was really good. - Yeah. Let's go see Austin. Hey, buddy. We got pancakes for you. You may not think so, but staying home to study was the right thing to do. Yep. I was here. All night. Really learned my lesson. - I love you guys. - Aw, we love you too. Fan alert. "Check out Austin's amazing performance... From tonight's music for kids-a-thon". Austin Monica Moon, get back here! You snuck out and performed at Ally's fundraiser? I had to. I couldn't let her down. You can ground me forever. And I'll never eat another pancake. Oh, you got that right, mister. I didn't mean that last part! That's just the beginning of your punishment. Wasn't making my middle name Monica punishment enough? Go to bed. We'll finish this in the morning. Psst! Austin? Want to sneak out and go see a movie? Oops. Wrong house. Mike. Mimi. Wow. Look at all these people! This place is really packed. Yeah. Thanks to the publicity we got from "Cheetah Beat," sales have been going through the roof. Psst! Austin? Want to go see that movie later? You don't have to keep popping your head up everywhere. And I can't go to the movies. I'm still grounded. My parents are making me read all these books. Lucky. My punishment is I'm not allowed to read any books. Hey, son. Are you ready to... Lester... Mike. Mimi. Lester! We'll be in the car son. Wow, your parents really don't like each other, do they?
