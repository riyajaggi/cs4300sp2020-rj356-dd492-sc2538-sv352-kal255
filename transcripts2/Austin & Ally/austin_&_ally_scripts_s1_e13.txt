Now! Wait. No, not now. Now! Not now. Now! Not now. Now! Not now. Now! Not now. Ow, my neck. Oh, forget it. It's not her. It's that long-haired guy from the surf shop.

 Whoa! Bruno Mars is doing a surprise show at the beach club in 10 minutes! Let's go! Wait, don't you have practice with Ally at 4:00? - Oh, yeah. - What time is it now? - 4:30. - Well, I'm already late. We'll just work longer next time. Uh, she won't be mad at me. - I am so mad at him! - What's wrong, honey? Austin was supposed to be here two hours ago! And now I have to go to the emergency Mall Association meeting. Everyone's freaking out about all the burglaries. I know. Last week someone stole a guitar pick. I'm just sick about it! We give those away for free. Delivery for Lester Dawson. Oh, me me me!

 It's funny. When the guy at the coffee shop gives you coffee, he gets a tip. And how heavy is a cup of coffee? Not as heavy as all these boxes I carry. You're right, it's not fair. You should get a job at the coffee shop. What'd you get? Something to help me catch the mall thief... A state-of-the-art security camera. State-of-the-art in what century? I'm gonna go set this up. Would you please put that new guitar over in the display case? Guess who got a job at The Yarn Barn? I spent my first day knitting this scarf instead of working. That scarf would really come in handy... If we didn't live in Miami. This is the third time this week he's been late. Maybe he had an emergency. Hey guys, we just went to an awesome concert! At the emergency room? No, at the beach! I think I still have some sand in my shoe. That's a lot of sand. I knew about the Bruno Mars concert too, but I didn't go because we made a commitment to rehearse at 4:00. You can't set a time for creativity. Yeah, you can. It was 4:00. Well, I'm here now. We can rehearse all night. We can't. I have a meeting. I'm tired of always doing things on Austin time. If you won't respect my time, how can we be partners? - I'm sorry, Ally. - I gotta go. Come on, Trish. Austin, I'm so disappointed in... In... I... I'm leaving. Hey, Austin. That was a lot of sand. I built a sand castle! When the crowd wants more, I bring on the thunder. 'Cause you've got my back, and I'm not going under. You're my point, you're my guard. You're the perfect chord. And I see our names together on every billboard. We're headed for the top, we've got it on lock. We'll make 'em say "hey!" And we'll keep rockin'. Oh, there's no way I could make it without ya. Do it without ya, be here without ya. It's no fun when you're doing it solo. With you it's like, "whoa,". Yeah, and I know. I own this dream. 'Cause I got you with me. There's no way I could make it without ya. Do it without ya, be here without ya. I feel bad about always being late. I wanna make it up to Ally. Give her a gift! I have just the thing! An Abe Lincoln ice sculpture. She does like honesty. No. I gotta give her something else. I've got lots of ice sculptures in here... Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, The Grand Canyon... Actually, never mind. The Mall Association meeting is now in session. Man oh man, do I love gaveling! Uh, does anyone have anything new to report concerning the burglaries of the mall? Um, yes, Pirate Frank. You had your hook up first. Arr... The scallywag stole me harpoon off the wall of me fish fry. Uh, y-you're not at work. You don't have to talk in that weird voice. What do ye mean? I have something to say. I don't want to make waves or anything. - But... - What is it, Bill? Actually, it's "Billl" with three "L"s. Anyway, someone "stol-lle" my boogie board. So not cool-ll. Uh, "cool" only has one "L". It's al-ll good, Al-lly. Hey, what are we doing about my guitar pick?! I mean, this is an outrage, people! Order in the food court! Order in the food court! Be quiet! Man, I love yelling. As President of the Mall Association, I assure you we're doing the best we can to catch the thief. Well, your best isn't good enough! Dad?! Sorry, honey. Love you. Look, we filed the police report, but what if there was a reward? Every store in the mall can give free stuff to whoever helps catch the thief. Great idea! I'll give a year's supply of food from me oyster bar. - Yeah! - I'll throw in a free surfboard. - Yeah! - I can give away free yarn. Aw. But I'm sure I'll get fired soon and work at a store that has better stuff! Yeah! Great. Uh, one last thing... I know this is kind of obvious, but until the thief is caught, the police suggested we shouldn't leave our stores unattended. Oh. Thanks. Ahem... - Ahem... - Here's a cough drop. Thanks. You don't think I overreacted about Austin being late to practice, do you? No. He was totally disrespectful of your time. He can't just do things when he wants to. Thanks, Trish. Oh, did you pass out those reward fliers like I asked you to? No, I didn't want to. Trish? Sorry, I was taking a nap. It's this blanket I made. It's so soft I just wanna curl up and sleep every time I touch it. I guess I'll finish putting up these reward fliers myself. You're pretty lucky. It seems like you're the only store in the mall who hasn't been robbed yet. It's not luck, Trish. I've been watching this store like a hawk. There's no way anyone's gonna rob old "Hawkeye" Dawson. Someone robbed me. - What? - The new guitar is gone! Way to go, "Hawkeye." Oh, your dad put up that new security camera. - Let's go check the footage. - Oh! We'll pull up the footage from the last 24 hours. Good idea. Oh, there's someone! We can just skip that. This must be the thief! - Austin?! - No way! - Trish. - I'm telling you. It's the blanket. Seriously, it's like sleeping on a cloud. Austin's the mall thief! We have to turn him in. There must be some explanation. Austin may be late a lot, but he doesn't steal. The crime is on tape! Well, there's two crimes. His stealing and your dancing. Hey. Wait... I know why you want to turn him in. You just want the rewards from all the stores. I am his manager and his friend. Do you really think I'd sell him out for a surfboard, and a tanning coupon, and some sunglasses, and a free massage chair, and some jeans, and a flat screen TV? He's my friend. He's my friend. Look, I know Austin, and there's no way he's a thief. I'm gonna give him a chance to explain himself. A free trip to Hawaii?! I can always make new friends. I can always make new friends. I can always make new friends. Remember, you can't te anybody about the guitar. Your secret's safe with me. - Austin, it's Ally. - One second! - Be cool. - Got it. Cool. So what's up? Nothing. Just wanted to talk. Are you still mad about me being late? Why? Is there something else I should be mad at you about? No, just the late thing. You got a lot of nice instruments in here. Get any new ones lately? No. Then what's this?! That was my made bed. Now I'm not gonna get any allowance. Thanks a lot. Sorry. You're sure you don't have anything you wanna tell me? Like uh, some big secret? Uh, uh... My middle name's Monica. - What? - Nothing! Look, from now on whenever you need me, I'm available. - Just not right now. I'm not available. - Wait. Hold on! Trish! Welcome to The Yarn Barn! I just got back from Austin's and he totally lied to my face! I guess he really is the mall thief. Then don't you think it's your duty as President of the Mall Association, to turn over the security tape? I guess so. Good! I'm glad you agree with me. I already turned in the tapes. Why would you do that?! Two words... "Re-wards." Oh. Maybe he can get out of this. He won't go to jail unless they actually catch him with the guitar. - Hi, Ally. - You're going to jail. You have some nerve. Do you have any idea what you've put us through? We've had to sit through boring mall meetings for you... Collect rewards... So you're returning the guitar because you felt bad about stealing it? I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it to get it autographed by Bruno Mars. I know how much you love him and I felt bad about being late. Austin, that's incredible. I would have given it to you earlier, but I had to wait to get it autographed. Thank you. I wish I knew this before. The Mall Association... - Thinks you're the thief. - What?! Relax. I'll clear this up. The employees of this mall are some of the most rational and understanding people I know. We want Austin! We want Austin! We want Austin! You better run. We want Austin! We want Austin! We want Austin! We want Austin! Arr! Where be Austin Moon? Guys, calm down. I mean, seriously, pitchforks and torches? We got them from the pitchfork and torch store. We want Austin! - We want Austin! - Dez! We want Austin! Why are you in the angry mob that wants to arrest Austin? I thought this was a happy mob that wanted to hear Austin sing. - Where be the mall thief?! - Yeah! Look, a-Austin's not the thief. It was all a misunderstanding. He borrowed the guitar to get it autographed for me, see? You're just covering for him because he's your Matey! - Yeah! - No! No. It's the truth. Austin's not the thief, I swear! All he's ever stolen are the hearts of his fans. Did you hear her? He steals people's hearts! Yeah! We should, like, totally stop him before he, like, robs another store in the mal-ll! Yeah! We want Austin! We want Austin! What'd I miss? So how'd it go with the mob? I told them the truth, but they didn't believe me. They still think you're the mall thief. Wait a minute, he's not the thief? Ah. I never doubted you. We need to clear your name. All we need to do is find the real thief... And fast. Oh, but not too fast. I still have to cash in some rewards. Come on, I'm not gonna throw away a coupon for free hair extensions. Haw-haw-haw-haw! Give me that! Uh, can we just get back to trying to find the thief? Okay, here's what we know. So far the thief has stolen an air conditioner, a boogie board, a cowboy hat, some... I got it! He's a sweaty cowboy who loves to surf! Or he's a sweaty surfer who likes to ride horses. Either way he is sweaty. Wait a minute! The thief is stealing things in alphabetical order. He's The Alphabet Bandit! If anybody asks, I came up with that. Woo woo woo... No one is gonna ask. Okay, so what was the last thing he stole? An octopus from the pet shop. That means he's up to the letter "P." Oh, no! Oh, thank goodness. My "P." you're still here. We need to set a trap. Oh, I've got it! Can everyone be back at the store tomorrow night at 9:00? - Yeah. Sure. - I'll be here. That means 9:00 real time, not 9:00 Austin time. Hey, that was the old me. I promise I'll be here on time. Okay, here's the plan. We'll advertise a sale for everything that starts with "P": Piccolos, pianos, pan flutes. The thief won't be able to resist and we'll catch him. It'll be the last "P" he ever takes. Very mature. Okay, it is kind of funny. Where is he? It's 9:30. I can't believe Austin is late again. He promised! A little help? Here we are trying to clear his name and, he doesn't even show up to help? What is his problem? I've got a problem... You're talking and I'm working! Oh sorry, Trish. Where did you get this giant bird cage, Dez? I used to have a pet ostrich until it ran away... At 60.6 miles per hour. I hope this works. Oh, it will. The thief's gonna come in, see the piccolo, trip the wire, and get trapped in the cage. Can I get a what-what? - What? - What? I still think this trap is better. A giant glue mouse trap? No, a giant glue people trap. It's the more humane way to capture a human. Is that pizza? Yeah, it's delicious. And it starts with the letter "P." Nobody would be dumb enough to step on a glue trap for a plain old slice of pizza. Oh, you're right. I better put some parmesan cheese on it. Dez, no! Well... I was wrong. Someone is dumb enough. Oh uh, Trish, throw him your hair. We'll pull him out. All right, ready? One... Two... Three! That did not go as planned. Dez, help us! Dez, come on. We need your help! Just try your best! It's the thief! - My plan is working! - What?! Sort of. Hey, ski mask guy, can you help us? Can't. Too busy stealing stuff. I would take that pizza, but there's no parmesan on it. - So I guess I'll just take the piano. - Not my piano! No no no no no no no no no. No no no! I am begging you! - Mister, please! - The other way. Turn around! Okay okay. We're almost gonna catch you. Just slow down a little. Did you get him? Did you get him? Ha, gotcha! Wait, you're the delivery guy. You're the thief?! Why did you steal all this stuff? Because nobody in the mall tips me. I should've gotten a job at the coffee shop. - Austin? - I caught the thief. It's the delivery guy! How did you get him? Where were you? I was hiding in the piano. I got to the store super early because I promised you I wouldn't be late. Wait a minute, you weren't late? Told you, Trish. Why didn't you come out of the piano earlier? I was setting up a trap using your blanket to muffle the piano strings, but the second my face hit this blanket, I was out like a light. I know, right? I'm just glad we caught The Alphabet Bandit. Now all we need to do is get out of this cage, clear your name with the Mall Association and get a giant bucket of glue remover. Glue remover? What for? Hey, guys. What did I miss? Here, Ally, I want you to have this calendar. It has all the dates I'm available to work with you. But it's blank. Yeah. You fill in the dates and whenever you need me... I'm there. No more Austin time. From now on, it's Austin and Ally time. Thank you, Austin. Uh, how's today at 4:00? Sorry, today's no good. Kidding! I'm kidding! Since all four of us helped catch the thief, Trish is gonna share the rewards with us. Isn't she nice? Okay, let's see... Ally, you take this really cool pen. I'll take this flat screen TV. Dez, you take this candle. I'll take this laptop. Austin, you take this key chain. And I guess I'll take this trip to Hawaii. Aloha. I got a candle!
