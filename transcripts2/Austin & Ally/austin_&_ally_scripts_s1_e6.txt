 Austin & Ally (2011â€“2016): Season 1, Episode 6 - Tickets & Trashbags - full transcript 
 Trish has booked Austin a gig at the Miami Internet Music Awards with a famous rapper Shinny Money. When the paper said that he gets to only invite one guest, Ally, Trish, and Dez tries their best to impress Austin. When Austin says yes to each one of them, he instead took Nelson. When they had just realized it's about Austin, they disguised themselves as dancers which gets chaos when Ally got a stage fright, and Trish and Dez made Shinny Money get hurt when he was trying to jump but landed face down the ground when Trish and Dez didn't catch him.

 Subs created by: David Coleman. How was that? Well, you got all the notes, just not in the right order or in the right key. - Thanks! - Yeah. Ally, Nelson, quick. We need you off the piano. Put your hands in the air and back away from the baby grand. Guys, what did I tell you about bringing food in the... Ugh... Store? - Yes! - Awesome! That was way better than smashing peanuts in my laptop.

 All right, Nelson. Lesson's over. You can go wash up. I'm melon man! Guess who got a job at Megaphone World? Who? And more importantly, guess who got an exciting piece of mail for... Mr. Austin Moon? What's it say? What's it say? I've been selected to take part in a study on male pattern baldness? Sorry. Wrong letter. I never knew you were bald. Killer toupee. Dude! Here you go. Whoa! I've been invited to the Miami Internet Music Awards? Oh ho!

 The rapper Shiny Money wants me to perform with him. I convinced him to sample your song "Double Take" in his new rap. Look at you, Trish, manager of the year. It was easy. All I had to do was stand outside his house doing this until he agreed to watch Austin's video. Oh, I hate that sound. Oh, well, in that case... I can't believe one of my songs is gonna be on an award show. I can't believe Austin's singing with Shiny Money. He's my favorite. I hope he'll sign the picture of him I keep in my wallet. Who cares about autographs? I can't wait to break out my red carpet walk. You call that a red carpet walk? Check this out. Uh. Woo! Step aside, rookies. Let, uh, Ally D. Show you how it's done. The four of us are gonna have the best night ever. I know, and look... I get access to an exclusive after party... Yay! A complimentary gift bag... Yay! And an extra ticket for one guest! Yay! What? I only get one extra ticket to the show. I've never been good at math, but one ticket times three friends is... Carry the four. It means only one of us gets to go. Huh. I got 47. When the crowd wants more, I bring on the thunder. 'Cause you've got my back, and I'm not going under. You're my point, you're my guard. You're the perfect chord. And I see our names together on every billboard. We're headed for the top, we've got it on lock. We'll make 'em say "hey!" And we'll keep rockin'. Oh, there's no way I could make it without ya. Do it without ya, be here without ya. It's no fun when you're doing it solo. With you it's like, "whoa,". Yeah, and I know. I own this dream. 'Cause I got you with me. There's no way I could make it without ya. Do it without ya, be here without ya. Wow, Trish, thanks for lunch. I didn't even know th made frosted french fries. They don't. But I do. This wouldn't have anything to do with you wanting to be my guest at the award show, would it? Wha-a-at? Don't be ridiculous. I want you to know this isn't about me. You only get to bring one guest, so it's a decision you need to think long and hard about. - Thanks, I'm glad... - Enough thinking you're taking me. It's not that easy. You know I'm bad at making decisions. I couldn't even figure out which sneakers to wear this morning. Look, you owe me. I'm your manager. Without me, you wouldn't even have this gig. You're right. You can come with me. I'll just have to break the news to Dez and Ally. Great. I'm gonna get a job at dress hut so I can get something new to wear. What about Megaphone World? Oh. Ah, I'll just quit. Oh. It's all the way at the other end of the mall. Attention, Megaphone World... I quit! Trish, you were fired yesterday. Please return the megaphone. Dez, I need to talk to you. What are you doing? Practicing my award show reactions. You never know when you're gonna be on camera. Awesome. I'd better practice mine too. They just announced the video of the year. Standing ovation! You're the man! I love you. - Let's do the wave! - Oh cool. Woo! We're gonna have so much fun at the award show. About that. Listen, Dez, I need to tell you something. I've been thinking about the award show and... And you're trying to figure out how to let Ally and Trish down easy. Just say, "I'm taking Dez. I like him better than you." "Stop crying, losers." How is that letting them down easy? If you want, I can tell 'em. Can I tell 'em?! Look, Dez, I obviously wanna take you. I mean you're not just my video director, you're my best friend. Yeah. I've been there for you through everything. Remember that time at camp when you ripped your pants and I gave you mine? Yeah, you went pant-less for the rest of summer. And most of the fall. Oh, and remember that time we got stuck in the elevator? - I gave you my pants then too. - Yeah. There was really no reason to do that. That's what best friends are for. I mean, I can't imagine us not going to your first award show together. You're right. I could never go without you. I'm just gonna have to tell Trish and Ally the ticket's yours. Our first award show! Awesome sauce! Here you go, buddy. Are you sure you want to play the Sousaphone, Nelson? It's a really heavy instrument. It's okay. I'm strong. Just in case, I'd better keep holding on to... - Austin, hey. - Whoa! Aw, nartz. Austin, I'm glad you're here. I just want to let you know... I get what you're going through. Really? You're growing hair on your toes too? Ewe. No. I meant I understand how tough this ticket nonsense must be for you. And the last thing I want to do is add any pressure. Just because Shiny Money's sampling "Double Take"... A song I wrote... Doesn't mean you have to take me. - Really? - Really really. Well, great! Yep. Greaty great great. But here's the thing... Aw, but you said greaty great great. If you did wanna take me... And again, totally cool if you don't... I need to know sooner rather than later, because I already requested the night off work, and I need a full day for dress alterations, and if we're gonna match my purse to your tie which I'm assuming we would... If I give you the ticket, will you stop talking? Yes. I would totally stop talking. - Because I'd be so excited... - You can come! Besides, you're right. You're my partner. You deserve to go. Without your song, I wouldn't even be performing with Shiny Money. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Oh! Yay! Yay. Austin, can I ask you something? I know. Why did I say yes to everybody? What was I supposed to do? They all deserve to go. I couldn't say no. No, I was gonna ask you for help. I'm stuck! Don't worry about what happened with the Sousaphone, Nelson. All instruments can be dangerous to play. Is that why you're wearing a helmet? Oh no, this is just how I play drums. Whoa ho ho ho! Thank you, Dez. No, I'm dizzy from playing head drums. Whoa ho ho ho. What do you think? Did your dress get a job at the megaphone store because it is loud! Some day you're gonna take off that helmet... And I'll be waiting. Why are you all dressed up? Because I'm going with Austin to the Miami Internet Music Awards. No, you're not. Austin promised me the extra ticket. Sorry, ladies, you're both wrong. I'm going to the Music Awards. Please. You're not even dressed for it. Oh, but I am. Exhibit A... Formal backpack. Whatever. He's taking me. - No way. - He promised me. I'm not taking any of you. I'm not taking any of you because I'm not going. What are you talking about? I messed up. I promised all of you you could come with me. Why would you do that? Because you gave me frosted french fries... And Dez gave me his pants and Ally... Talked for a really long time. I don't talk for a really long time. I think I talk for a normal amount of time. I mean, then again, what is the definition of normal? Your normal could be different from my normal which could be different from Trish's normal. And uh, you were saying? I'm gonna call Shiny Money and tell him I can't perform. This night is about all of us. If we all can't be there, none of us should. Wow. Of all the selfish things I've ever heard! And after all I've done for you, I can't believe this is how you thank your manager. Yeah. And this is how you thank your partner? - This is my moment too. - And some best friend you are. I was this close to rubbing knees with Shiny Money. It's elbows... Rubbing elbows. I can't do that. I have sensitive elbows. At least something around here is sensitive, because Austin clearly doesn't care about our feelings. You know what? Forget it! I thought you all wanted to be there tonight for me, but I was wrong. You're all acting like selfish little kids. - Nuh-uh! - You are! And I'm not spending my night with a little kid. Come on, Nelson. Me and you are going to the award show. I thought you'd never ask. - Did we really just...? - Yup. - And Austin's going to...? - Uh-huh. - So we're pretty much... - The worst friends ever. Oh! I wanna play the finish-the-sentence game! Say something, Trish. - Dez, you are such an... - Elephant! Tractor! Pineapple! Yes, you are such an elephant tractor pineapple. I'm great at this game. So now what? We sit here all night feeling horrible about ourselves? Not necessarily. Wait a minute. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - We need to sneak into the show! - It would be so cool to own a penguin. Sneak into the show? Trish, we've already upset Austin enough for one night. And Dez, where would you even keep a penguin? In a bathtub with ice? You guys heard Austin... He wants us all there. We have to go there and make this right. I guess. Great. So we're all on the same page? Yes! I'll get the penguin, you get the ice and we'll all meet at Ally's bathtub. Welcome back to the Miami Internet Music Awards. Now to announce the nominees for best viral video the stars of the summer blockbuster "Mummy Mommy," Cameron Diaz and little Haley Carlisle! Whoa! Hotdogs and chocolate. Chocolate-covered hotdogs remind me of Dez. Austin Moon, you're on in five! Yelling reminds me of Trish. Whoa, Cotton Candy! That reminds me of Ally. Cotton Candy? No, this picture of Ally. Why did I bring this? I just wish my friends were here. I'm Cotton Candy man! Rawr rawr! I really really wish my friends were here. Rawr rawr! Rawr! The Miami Internet Music Awards will be back with Shiny Money and special guest Austin Moon. Okay, we're in. Can we take off these trash bags now? No, we need to look like we belong here. Shiny Money's performing "Trash Talka'" and his dancers wear trash bags. See? I think this is a good look for me. And the best part is you never have to worry about finding a trash can. Let's just find Austin. We'll be fine as long as nobody who works here sees us. Like that guy! Hide. Show time. Everyone take your places. Did we just move? I felt like... Ah! Check it out. It's Shiny Money and Austin. Hey, Austin! Make some noise for the one and only Shiny Money, with special guest Internet sensation Austin Moon! Miami, make some noise. - What do we do? - We could ask for his autograph. We about to take the trash out on y'all. It's your boy Shiny Money and Austin Moon. Shiny Money, Shiny Money. Shine to the money style. Woo! It's time to take out the trash. Woo! It's shiny time, it's shiny time. You gotta make make make 'em do a double take... - What are you guys doing here? - Trying to learn the dance. You gotta make make make 'em do a double take... - Austin, let me explain. - I can't believe you guys. You gotta make make make 'em do a double take... - Austin, please. - How could you guys get in here? You gotta make make make 'em do a double take. They call me Shiny Money... Hey you, get over here! I'll explain later! Got a shiny smile, and my perfect shiny face. Can be seen in the crowd all the way from outer space. Shiny pants, shiny shoes, shiny shades, gotta watch 'em groove. Shiny car with the treble and bass. See me fly by, make you do a double take. Hey, it's shiny time, it's shiny time. You gotta make make make 'em do a double take. It's money time, it's money time. You gotta make make make 'em do a double take. It's garbage time, it's garbage time. You gotta make make make 'em do a double take. Now for the jump, now for the jump. You gotta make make make him do a double take. Oh! I think we were supposed to catch him. Double take. - You guys still here? - Yeah, Austin, we are so sorry. Sorry for what? For caring more about yourselves than you care about me? Uh, you're talking to a trash bag. Oh. Sorry for what? For caring more about yourselves... Austin! You're right. We were being selfish, but then we realized tonight was about you, not us. That's why we came down here... To support you. So you guys weren't just thinking about yourselves? If I was only thinking about myself, do you think I would wear such a ridiculous outfit? Yeah, that purple dress you had on earlier was awful. I'm talking about the trash bag. I'm sorry we ruined the show for you. You didn't ruin it. Actually, you totally ruined it... But I'm happy you guys came. Really? Yeah. We're a team. I couldn't imagine my first award show without you guys here. Buddy, if I was wearing real pants, I'd totally give 'em to you right now. Yeah, I think we should just go back to fist-bumping. Boom! Hey, you're the two that were supposed to catch me. - You're not still mad, are you? - Still? It just happened an hour ago! Actually, it was two hours ago. You blacked out a little bit. My doctor said I can't perform for at least eight months. Thanks a lot. - Hey, you're welcome. - High five. Ah! This is way better than any of those real after parties. Can you imagine me and Nelson hanging out at that after party? Where is Nelson, anyway? This is the best day ever! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! My hotdogs, oh yeah, oh yeah. Woo!
