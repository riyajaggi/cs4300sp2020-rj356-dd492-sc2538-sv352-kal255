 Austin & Ally (2011â€“2016): Season 2, Episode 1 - Costumes & Courage - full transcript 
 The head of Austin's record company invites Team Austin to a Halloween Party at an allegedly haunted mansion, and gives him the opportunity to sing a duet with a famous female pop-country singer. But when Dez's new ghost-hunting obsession puts that singer temporarily out of commission, it forces Ally to do something she has been afraid to do for quite a while.

 Subs created by: David Coleman. You're still carving that pumpkin? It's been hours. It takes time to capture the perfection that is Austin's face. Almost done. Voila! Amazing. It looks just like Austin. Except my hair's parted on the other side. Oh, man. Guess I gotta start over. Oh. Guess who got a job at the Halloweenatorium?

 So are you on a break, Trish? Want to go grab a sand- "witch"? You're gonna high-five her for that? Austin Moon, my favorite new artist. Jimmy Starr, my favorite new... Guy who signed me to his record label. That's me. I wanted to invite you kids to the Starr Records Halloween party this Saturday. - What? - No way! That's the coolest Halloween party in Miami. I heard usher was there last year. Who's gonna be there this year? Beyonce? Katy Perry? A lot of big stars will be there, but you won't know who's who because they'll all be in costume.

 Oh. I just got an RSVP from Taylor Swift. - Taylor Swift? - No way! I love her! Perfect. I can finally give her this pumpkin I carved of her. I think she's wearing her hair straight now. Oh, man! Oh! Stay away from Taylor at the party. Now, here's the deal. I want you guys to write a new song for Austin to perform. I'm performing for a bunch of stars? How awesome is that, Ally? Totally awesome. We get to write a song that the biggest names in music will hear. Halloween just got a lot scarier. You'll be fine. There's the invite. Cool, it's at Brownstone Mansion. Ooh, I heard that place is haunted. Mysterious red slime oozes from the walls. Well, at least that's what it says on the brochure. See you guys there. - Bye. - See you, Jimmy. Trish, I want to get a cool costume for the party. You working tomorrow? Well, I was planning on getting fired later this afternoon. But I guess I can push it one more day so you can get a discount. Yes! When the crowd wants more, I bring on the thunder. 'Cause you've got my back, and I'm not going under. You're my point, you're my guard. You're the perfect chord. And I see our names together on every billboard. We're headed for the top, we've got it on lock. We'll make 'em say "hey!" And we'll keep rockin'. Oh, there's no way I could make it without ya. Do it without ya, be here without ya. It's no fun when you're doing it solo. With you it's like, "whoa". Yeah, and I know. I own this dream. 'Cause I got you with me. There's no way I could make it without ya. Do it without ya, be here without ya. Okay. When you think of Halloween, you think of costumes. Ooh! Maybe the song could be about the mask we all hide behind. Like this? Aah! Austin! Sorry. I'm getting us in the mood to write a Halloween song. Let's think of things that scare us. You go first. Well, obviously I'm scared of performing in front of people. Ooh! Sometimes when I burp, I'm afraid there's an alien in my stomach trying to bust out. Don't you have any fears that aren't... I don't know, absolutely ridiculous? I am kind of freaked out about singing in front of all those stars at the party. That makes sense. That's a lot of pressure. Remember what you told me that time we went to the water park and I was scared to go down the giant water slide? Keep your mouth closed at the bottom. There might be pee in the pool? Yes. But you also said no matter how scared I was, just push ahead and don't look down. Hey, that could be a cool chorus. Yeah. Don't drink the pee in the pool... No no no. No. I meant don't look down. Don't look down... Yeah, that's good too. Trish, put this pirate costume on the top shelf, these vampire fangs in aisle seven, and these swords in the display window. I'll get right on it, boss. Can you help me? Does it look like I work here? You're sitting behind the counter. Fine. Oh, how may I help you, oh valued customer? Do you have a Charles Lindbergh costume? Charles who-to-the-what-now? Lindbergh. First man to fly a plane across the Atlantic. And... Boring. Here's an old pilot costume. Now go away. Hey, Dez. Great costume. But didn't you go as an idiot last year? Uh, no. This year my costume's gonna be a surprise. I'm just testing out my ghost hunting kit for the party. That junk doesn't work. Oh, really? Well, my ghost detector says this isn't a real ghost. See? It works. Trish, you messed up. I asked for a caveman costume and you gave me a cake man. Well, I'm going as a cave woman, so pick something else. Fine, what about a... A ninja? Ninja costumes are all the way upstairs. Oh! Be a gladiator. Oh, a gladiator! Now I can show off my muscles. Boom boom. Works better when I'm not inside a cake. So, what do you think of this? You can't go wrong being a cute nurse. I'm not just any cute nurse. I'm Florence Nightingale. Founder of modern nursing. You know what? I think I found the perfect guy for you. He's cute, and... - Do you know who Charles Lindbergh is? - Duh. Only the first guy to... He's right over there. Go talk to him. Okay, Ally. You can do this. Just say, "hi. I'm Ally." Hi. I'm Ally. I'm Ethan. Nice Florence Nightingale costume. He likes my costume. Say something funny. Yep. Good old Flo. That was not funny. Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you too. Would have been a good thing to say out loud. Hey, I've seen worse. I wish I could be more confident and cool. It's Halloween. You can be anything you want. You're right. I'm gonna be... Galexis Nova! I love Galexis Nova! Mild-mannered nuclear physicist by day. Butt-kicking intergalactic avenger by night. She's confident and fearless. You're never gonna pull it off. Hey, that's not nice. No, I mean she's never gonna pull it off the mannequin. The zipper's stuck. Uh, I'll... I'll get my costume later. I have to go. I'm meeting someone for lunch. Really, who? I don't know. Well, that's suspicious. What's that all about? I don't know. But let's go find out. I'll bring this costume back later. Like I care. There's Ally. Why is she with Jimmy? Why are you staring at me like that? I'm just really hungry, man. What could they be talking about without me? Let's find out. My ghost hunting kit came with a supersonic sound sensor. What are they saying? Well, she asked him if he had a poopy diaper, and then he said, "goo goo ga ga goo." Dez, you're pointing at the wrong people. Give me those. Come on. I know you wrote it for Austin, but I played "don't look down" for Taylor Swift, and she loved it. She wants to sing it at the party. You're kidding. Taylor Swift wants to sing my song? Don't say anything to Austin. This is just between you and me. It'll be our little secret. That was supposed to be my song. I can't believe she's giving it away. I can't believe Danny's taking Sarah's sister to The Prom instead of her. Drama... I'm so mad at Ally and Jimmy for giving away my song, I just want to yell at them! Oh. Bad idea. Jimmy's the head of your label. He can cancel your record deal. What should I do? Well, I do know one technique for dealing with anger. You write a message to the person you're upset with. Tell them how you feel. Then you get rid of that message. Symbolically purging the negativity of your inner psyche. Okay. I'll give it a try. "Dear Ally and Jimmy, I'm so..." "Mad at you guys right now." "I don't want anything to do with people who are..." "Evil gutless rats!" Oh that is good. Dez, Dez it worked. I feel better already. That's because it's out of here, and up into here. Wow, Dez. That's really smart. Thanks, buddy. Now we just need to get rid of this text. Just hit the "don't send" button. Don't send? There's no don't send button! You sent the text! Oopsie! What are we gonna do? I don't want Ally or Jimmy reading that. Okay. Let's just calm down. It takes a while for a text to go through. Evil gutless rats?! I can explain. I was mad at you and Jimmy, so Dez made me do this thing where I write my feelings down and not send them. And then he... He sent them. Dez! Do you realize what you've done? Yes! I've cured my friend of his rage. Why were you so angry? Because you and Jimmy gave the song we wrote to Taylor Swift. We sent it to her because Jimmy wanted you guys to sing a duet. It was supposed to be a surprise. I'm singing with Taylor Swift? That's awesome. What up? You know you called the head of your record label an evil gutless rat? Uh-oh. Jimmy's gonna be furious when he reads it. Maybe we can get his phone at the party and delete the message before he reads it. In the meantime, let's flood his in box with new messages so he won't get a chance to read Austin's text. Yes. "Hey J-Starr, it's T-Swift. Looking forward to your party." "Hey Jimmy, it's Austin. You are an evil gutless rat." "Looking forward to your party." Oh. Hey, there's Austin. Why isn't he wearing a costume? Did you find Jimmy yet, Austin? Ha! Made you do a double take! Oh yeah. Wow. Great costume. Lousy voice. Hey, guys. Where's Jimmy? Wow. You two look amazing. Whoa. You're me! D-d-d double take. Boom. I hope you don't mind. I borrowed your clothes. As long as you're not wearing my lucky underwear. Oh, I'm not wearing any underwear. You can keep the pants. We gotta find Jimmy. I'll call him. - Hello? - That's him! - Hey! - Hey! No, that's not him. It's still ringing. Hey! You're not Jimmy! - What are you doing? - Well, uh... Bobbing for phones! It's a Halloween tradition. Uh... Jimmy? Jimmy? Jimmy? Jimmy? Oh, hey, J-Lo. - Ally! - Right. Jimmy? I wish we knew what costume he was wearing. I know what costume he's not wearing. Austin Moon. Because I am the only one. Hey, Austin. Aw, nartz! Make you do a double take. Mmm! Wow. It's like I'm looking in a mirror. A really tiny mirror. Bam! We have to find Jimmy before he reads that text. Let's split up. Uh, have you never seen a horror movie? You can't just split up in a haunted house. That's when one of the teenagers gets it. Let's hope it's the tall goofy one. We're splitting up. Hold on. Picking up something cold and soulless. Oh, hey. It's you. Jimmy? Jimmy? Jimmy! Sorry. Jimmy? Hey, nice costume. I'm Ethan. I know who you are. We've already met. We have? He doesn't recognize me! Hi, I'm Galexis Nova. I guess that makes me Charles Lindbergh. Nice banter. We're off to a good start. Now hit him with some knowledge. A little known fact about you, Mister Lindbergh, you developed the first artificial heart. Wow. Cute and smart. Hey, can I get your number? He wants my number? He wants my number! Yes! Yes! I didn't give him my number, did I? Jimmy? Jimmy, I've been looking for you. Well, I've been looking for you too. Oh, man. You checked your phone? No, I've been too busy working. Yes! Anyway I got a big surprise. Taylor Swift's gonna be performing with you. Oh, what? Taylor Swift? Oh, wow. That is... That is a surprise that I did not know. Guys, great news. I'm performing with Taylor Swift. Oh. - And Jimmy didn't check his phone. - Oh! We still need to delete the messages. Galexis Nova's got this. Hey, Jimmy. Can I borrow your phone? I need to text my dad. Here, you can borrow mine. She can't! "Hey, dad. Still at the party." Nah, I don't like that text. I'm gonna delete it. Delete. Delete delete delete delete delete delete delete. You know, I don't need to text my dad anymore. Thanks. You're welcome? - Yes! - Yeah! I guess I can finally start hunting some ghosts. Not that I believe any of that junk, but they say upstairs is the most haunted. I should probably get ready for my performance, so where's Taylor? Over there. Taylor Swift is dressed as Galexis Nova, too? Much better than the Florence Nightingale costume she wore last year. Well, ghost hunter, finding anything? - Nothing yet. - See? I told you. There are no ghosts. Oh yeah? Then what's that moaning? It's coming from the chimney! What's that on the wall? Red slime oozing out of the walls. Just like they said in the brochure. I'm getting scared. There's something in here. I can feel it. Dez! The chimney! It's the ghost! Ah! You hit Ally! Ally? Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. That's not you? We just knocked out Taylor Swift. Here you go. Taylor Swift can't perform. This is all your fault, Dez. Don't blame me. Blame the ghost. There wasn't a ghost. Trish was just messing with you. I know what I saw. What you saw was strawberry jam on the walls and a fog machine. The ghost put strawberry jam on the wall and a fog machine in the chimney? Yes, Dez. Yes, it did. I know ghosts were real. What are we gonna do? We should just tell Jimmy the truth. Or maybe we could write all our feelings down in a text message... No! We have a surprise tonight. Austin Moon will be performing with a very special guest. Taylor Swift! Let's hear it for Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! We can't leave Austin hanging. Wait. Taylor and I are wearing the same costume. Ally may have stage fright, but Galexis Nova doesn't. I know what to do. I'll go on stage costume, perform as Taylor Swift, and no one will know the difference. Guys, I know what to do. I'll go on stage in costume, perform as Taylor Swift... Yeah, we heard you the first time. You were thinking out loud. Taylor! Taylor! Yeah! Yeah. I could get used to this. This song is called "don't look down". It was written by my partner Ally Dawson. Austin, it's me, Ally. Taylor got hurt. Ally? I can't believe it. You're actually gonna do this? Just like at the top of the water slide. I'm gonna close my mouth and not look down. Okay, but open your mouth when it's your turn to sing. Yeah. Whoa. I'm walking on a thin line. And my hands are tied. Got nowhere to hide. I'm standing at a crossroads. Don't know where to go. Feeling so exposed. Yeah, I'm caught, in between. Where I'm going and where I've been. But I know there's no turning back. Yeah. It's like I'm balanced on the edge. It's like I'm hanging by a thread. But I'm still gonna push ahead. So I tell myself. Yeah, I tell myself. Don't look down. Down down down. Don't look down. Down down down. Don't look down. Down down down. Don't look down. Down down down. It'd be so easy just to run. It'd be so easy to just give up. But I'm not that girl who's gonna turn my back. There's no turning back. No turning back. It's like I'm balanced on the edge. It's like I'm hanging by a thread. But I'm still gonna push ahead. So I tell myself. Yeah, I tell myself. Don't look down. Down down down. Don't look down down. Down down. Don't look down down. Down down. Don't look down, don't look down. Down down down. You guys were great! I'm so proud of you Ally. You did it! You really did it. I'm proud of you too. Hey, now you can perform with Austin all the time. Yeah! I don't know I think I was only able to do that because, I was pretending to be somebody else. Well, mask or no mask. That was you up there, and you rocked! I did didn't I? Maybe someday I could do that as Ally Dawson. - Great job Taylor. - Thanks. I can't believe people think you're Taylor Swift. I can't believe people think that's Austin. Okay, one more.
