 Sarah's annoyance at the invasion of her privacy turns to anger when she's questioned by Jack about the discovery that Sarah is not her real name. She refuses to answer his questions, ...

 James. James! No. No-one else is to know about this. No-one. I'd only share what I know for his wellbeing. Good. Then there will be no need for you to break the confidence. I know a disappointed man when I see one. We're going to have a baby, James. But this... This will make a difference. You seemed very taken with the singer yesterday.

 To them, he's just a farmer, and I'd be just a fool. Our rooms have locks. I want the key to mine. In my experience, one doesn't guard a door unless there's something in the room. You checked the references of a woman called Sarah Adams. That is not her real name. I'll get to the bottom of it, Elizabeth. Because it is high time we knew exactly who Miss Bridget Adams really is. Sister? I don't want to hold you up, certainly not on your first day, but about yesterday... Yes.

 None of my other young ladies have ever asked for a key before, and certainly none of them have ever used that tone that you did... You went through my things. Someone did. Can't see Alma or Maude doing it. Things seemed a little untidy. I was simply trying to help put things in order. All I'm saying is, I hope that we can put this behind us. I'm sure we can. Good. Good. Because there's absolutely no reason why you and I should have a problem with each other, is there? Is there? Well, as I always say, those with nothing to hide need no lock and key. Great-Grandmamma. It has quite a ring to it. It does, doesn't it? Certainly put you in a good mood. Well, many things have. We'll have to show the baby off to Libby's family, of course. Not too soon, I hope. I wouldn't advise travelling with a wee one. I did it with your father. Very trying. Just a short trip. We might even fly. We could all go! 60 hours in a tin can? I can think of nothing less tantalising. It's the way of the future, Mother. Yours, perhaps. Better still, why don't we invite your parents here, Olivia? They'll have to make the crossing some time. That's a grand idea. Don't you think, James? William, too. He'd love to come. Late next year. We'll make it a real bush Christmas, and by then the baby will be old enough to be interesting. Look at you, Granddad. You're beaming. I am, aren't I? Yes, well, guest lists are a little premature. We'll see, closer to the time. Yes? Reporting for duty. Sister. Ah. Right. Yeah. Uh... Have a seat. Yeah. Nice and early. Can't wait to get started. A few things to sort out, and you're away. Uh, something's come up. I doubt it's a problem. It just needs clarifying. Yes? Your name. It's Bridget Adams, yeah? Not Sarah. Any reason why you're not going under your proper name? Simple question. So is the answer. Then let's have it. Get you to work. In my shoes, you'd be asking too. No, I'd be apologising that your privacy had been invaded. I can imagine how you got this information. Let's just get it sorted. How did you find out, Doctor? Why are you being so defensive? If I have nothing to hide? Yeah. Possibly it has something to do with someone going into my room and going through my personal effects and rushing off to spread mischief, and my employer somehow seeing me as the villain of the piece. I don't condone... I simply value my privacy. You have to give me more than that. Sarah is the name I have lived and worked under for years. And further than that, I'm asking for your trust. If not your support. You're using a name other than the one on your passport. For goodness' sake, woman, just tell me why! No. Come on. Sit down. You chose the wrong woman to interrogate, Doctor. Stop being so bloody dramatic! Back so early? Did you forget something? If you'll just let me explain, Miss Adams. God as my witness, I never meant you any harm! But you did me harm. I shouldn't have looked. I know. But you have so many secrets, and you were under my roof. Curiosity I forgive. But telling Jack Duncan what you found was spiteful. Dr. Duncan? I'd never do that. So it was a coincidence he found out? Well, no, but... It... Sarah. Bridget! I would never cost you your job. I know what it is to need a living. But I didn't tell Dr. Duncan. Don't make me say who. I see. Won't you come back inside? You ask a perfectly reasonable question of the woman, and she runs from it. Something of a validation, wouldn't you say? No. In fact, I think she made a fair point. As she fled the room. I think she's standing on a matter of principle, not hiding any guilt. Either way, Jack, she's unsuitable. If she is prepared to flounce off in high dudgeon on principle, she clearly doesn't want the job. We're well rid of her. How did you find out her real name? That's irrelevant. I'm asking if you went through her things. Don't be ridiculous. I'm assuming Doris did it for you. She seems to have given up the post. Accept her decision. I plan to apologise. Convince her to stay... if I can. That would be a mistake. Well, I'm willing to take a risk on it. I'm not. I don't accept your "on principle" theory. Hers are the actions of someone with something significant to hide. A desire for privacy isn't a crime. No, but it possibly hides one. Who knows? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop. I just wanted to let you know that I'm taking Olivia on a tour of the property, Grandmother. Very good. Jack. Be sensible. That's just what I intend to be. Oh! It's so lovely. I wish you'd brought me earlier. How? You wouldn't leave the house. I suppose I was rather in the doldrums, wasn't I? It's odd. Ever since the baby, I feel so different. Like I went to bed that girl, and woke up... me, I suppose. Do I sound like a mad person? No. You sound happy. Come on. In winter? The sun's shining, isn't it? But I didn't bring my costume. Neither did I. Anna, we can't just run around naked. What if someone comes? Well, then, we'd better hope they've got bad eyes. Come on! Where's that new girl you talked about? No-one's here. You're fine. I'm also British. Turn around. I can't believe I'm doing this. Hurry up! Alright. Come on, Livy. Ready? It is freezing in there! There she is. I'll need to leave my luggage here. How long until the Sydney train? Three o'clock. Fine. And I'll need to borrow a bicycle. Bike? Couldn't say where you'd find one around here. I saw one out the front. Yeah. That's mine. If you're looking for that woman, you're too late. She's gone. Gone where? I wouldn't know. Good riddance to bad news, if you ask me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd rather not discuss this in front of prying eyes. Livy, can I ask you something? Mmm? Did you always want babies? Of course. I just worried no-one would want to have them with me. James was the first boy I ever kissed, you know. Though I did like Kenneth McKinnon for a while. Nothing could have happened, of course. Why? Was he with someone? No. He was the gardener. That, and he wouldn't have looked twice at me even if I was a shrub. What do you think would have happened if... you'd shown interest in him? Heaven knows. But it wouldn't have been good. My cousin married beneath her. They stopped talking to her altogether. Mmm. Our black sheep's Aunt Caroline. I've never been told her sin. I think it's changing, though, all of that. I hope so. There. Anne of Green Gables would be jealous. Mummy would be horrified! Livy... are we friends now? Even better. We're sisters. Good. There's somewhere else I want to take you. Come on. Here we are. How the other half live. Don't be a snob. The Polettis are family friends. I'm sorry. I'm teasing. You've met him already. Gino and his father performed at the concert. Oh, the dreamy Italian. Of course I remember. Don't give me that look. It's just more fun than sandwiches with Gran. Mm-hm. Besides, it's time you made some more friends here. The whole family is lovely. They went through hell during the war. Mr. Poletti was interned as an enemy alien. Did they do that here? Their eldest son went back to fight for Mussolini. Broke their hearts. Don't talk about it. Anna! Oh, Anna! Girls! Anna. Sarah. What a nice surprise. I'm afraid this isn't a social visit. There are things you need to know. We'll be private in here. Thank you. There's no easy way to say this. James attempted suicide on the ship the night before we docked. No. Yes. Why? I have no idea. It was me who stopped him. And you only tell me now? James swore me to silence. He preferred your mother handled the situ... My mother knows? Just her and I. Which, I believe, is why she's made such a point of keeping me out of your lives. Something she's finally succeeded in doing. I'm leaving. Leave... Why? Ask your mother. That's not why I'm here. I'm here for James. I kept silent because she said she had his best interest at heart. I no longer believe that. He says he's fine. But watch him. I'm not convinced. You have no idea why he did it? If I knew, I would tell you. I won't forget your kindness, George. Can't I... I need a place to rest. Not more battles. What comes next you brought on yourself. Mother? All over! Gino! Today? Si! Smells wonderful. May I ask what it is? Ribollita. It's from Tuscany. It's very popular. What do you put in it? Oh! Everything. What she find in the kitchen she put. Almost. I haven't been to the north of Italy, only Napoli and Roma. E molto bella. Hey. Oh, aren't you full of surprises. I think the wine's gone to my head. You just can't find table wine here. Why is that? Every meal back home we had wine. Even for breakfast at Christmas. Australians no like. No, they like the port, sherry, birra, uffa! So, we make port. We make sherry. We make money from them. The wine we make for us. You take a bottle. Si. Oh, I'd love that. Thank you. How do you like it here? Everyone's been friendly. I suppose it's normal to miss home, though, isn't it? Hmm, no. For you, maybe. Now, we've been here over 20 years. Si. Huh? Must have been hard with the war and everything. Gilda, play a song? Gino's favourite? Hey! Hey, Gino, it's just music. We need music. Si. He sings it all day. In the vines. In bed. Always singing. Oh, I know this. It's from that film. What's it called? What have I said? 'Anna'. It's called 'Anna'. Oh, stop being silly! Come on! Si. Whoo-hoo! Come on, Gino! Gino's lovely. I suppose so. Oh, we've been friends for years. He's... he's more like a brother. This is so lovely. Mother? I've been calling. You didn't answer. Because I don't appreciate being bellowed at. Is what Sarah Adams said true? I don't know if anything she says is true. Did... James try to kill himself? Why? That's something you'll need to ask him. But before you pillory me, I kept his secret for the family. For you, most of all. Tell me, please, how this helps me. He's my son. And your son made a mistake. One he didn't want to inflict on you. That woman made a promise to James and to me. She should not have broken it. She saved his life. And now she threatens to ruin it. She saved his life and you repay her by running her out of town. You should be ashamed of yourself. James has rallied. If you bring it up with him, you be very careful. I will do what I think is right, both with James and with Sarah Adams. Shoo! You can't come. Shoo! I said shoo! Go back to the house! Go! Go! I can chuck a u-ey and give you a lift back to town if you'd like. No thanks, Roy. Look after that leg. I thought that was your job now. Come on, boy. You settle him down. I'll get the vet. Really? We should come with you. No. The last thing he needs is to be bouncing around on this rattle trap. I'll be back in two shakes of a lamb's tail. You're alright. You're alright. Shh. You're alright. This is a nice surprise. Good to see you can still hold an axe, not just a croquet mallet. You smell of wine. What have you been up to? I took her to the Polettis. They were having lunch, so we joined in. It was wonderful. And we went to the water hole too. It's beautiful there. Would you mind if I kept you company? Not at all. I'll see you at home, then. What are you doing? I'm helping. Is that wise in your condition? I'm expecting, not infirm. Besides, I'm a landowner's wife now. Time to get used to it. Have you seen your brother? He's mending the fence near the west dam. Did he say how long he'll be? No. What's happened? Just something I need to discuss with him. Well, I can get him. No, no. It's alright. But there is something you can do for me. You and Sarah have become close. Yes. Then go to the train station. She's planning to leave and perhaps you can do something I couldn't. Convince her to stay. Why would she leave? I'll explain later. Just go. If she gets on that train, I can't see her coming back. I'll bring her here? No, no, no. Put her up at the hotel for now and tell her that... Just hurry. She left her stuff and dashed off. That's all I can tell you. How long until the train? 20 minutes. I'll sit with the bags, then. You've got company. She'd better bring my bike back. Just me. Any idea where she is? I don't even know why she's leaving. Father wouldn't say. Do you? If he didn't, I probably shouldn't. Oh. Old enough to do everyone's bidding, but not to know why. You sound like you're reading too much Bronte. Well, the whole thing is just so 'Jane Eyre'. The distraught damsel rushing off without warning. Who's Rochester? You or father? This is melodramatic enough without you adding to it. I just want to know the story. Weren't you arguing about it with Gran this morning? Look, I don't pretend to know the half of it. Let's just change her mind. Oh, and questions about her past? Not the way to do it. You know... Anna. Why is it Gran lets you get away with murder? What do you mean? If James or I or even father spoke to her like you do, we'd be out on our ear. Ah. That's the question. Well, I'd like to know the answer as much as you. Let me know if you ever find out. If he makes the morning, he should pull through, but if I were you, I'd think about putting him down. He's no pup. I was thinking the same thing meself. I gave up on one animal yesterday. I'm not giving up on this one. So he's yours? Well, he's nobody's. But we won't put him down. I'll pay for the care. Okey-doke. I'll send you the bill. You know where I am. Thanks, Barry. Looks like you got yourself a dog. It was my fault. I want to stay with him. If that's OK by you. You suit yourself, missy. Look at you. Farmer's wife. James. A word. No need to wait, my dear. We'll be in. Miss Adams was here. She's told your father everything. What do you mean everything? Only what she knows. He's looking for answers. You have to find a story he can believe. Stick to it. Reassure him that you're alright. I am. Good. What will you say? The best lie is a version of the truth. Oh. Is James with you? There you are. Come to the sitting room. What's happening? Nothing. Just a business matter. So... it is true? You tried to kill yourself? Yes. You said nothing. I was ashamed. To despair so deeply that... You're my son. And you're my father. You could have talked to me. I felt I couldn't. Why, James? I was in love. With... someone in London. She came from nothing. Leaving her... broke my heart. It... broke something in me. If it was so serious... why rush into marrying Olivia? Grandmother found out. Made it very clear that I had to move on. So I did. I knew Livy through her brother. I knew marrying her would make everyone happy. The truth is, it did. Except you. Perhaps. But like it or not, Gran was right. I can't just marry anyone. None of us can. Promise me one thing. I won't feel like that again. You can't promise me that. But if you do... if you ever hurt that deeply, tell me. Let me help. I'm better now. I'm happy. I am. Maybe we should give it a while longer. No, that was the last train and if she's not back now, I'm guessing she doesn't mean to be. Unless something bad's happened. If she was that upset, do you think...? She's not the type to do anything rash. Rash? As in leave town and abandon all she owns at the station? Do you need a lift home? No, I've got the car and I promised father I'd wait until I saw her. You can't stay here all night. I'll call when I find her. Yeah? She's, um, lucky to have a boss who cares about her. She's a good nurse. I told him a tale. He accepted it. We're fine. For now. Tea's in the red tin if you're looking. I'm not making tea. Your dressing needs tending to. It's fine. It's filthy. Did you at least sterilise those bandages? In the oven, like you told me. Good. Then sit down and roll your pants up. So, where's it gonna be, then? Sydney, I s'pose. I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't take you as the type to cut and run. I don't see it as running. Don't you? No. I've been here a few days. There's nothing keeping me here. If you believed that, you wouldn't be here right now. Well, I couldn't just go and let the dog die. You stayed because you cared. Doesn't much matter about what. That's all I'm saying. But what would I know, hey? The haricots beurre are lovely. Has Jack called about Sarah? His name is Dr. Duncan. He doesn't mind. Why? Has something happened to her? She's missing. Has been all day. Just because someone absents themselves does not mean they're missing. I'd call it missing. No-one's seen her since she left here. The span of one afternoon doesn't exactly merit a manhunt. Why are you being so callous? What did she ever do to you? That's enough. Can we at least eat dinner in peace? No, I don't... Enough, Anna. What a difference a day makes. You're not helping. You're a hard woman to find. Sorry to have put you out. You said to take you at your word. I'm here to say I will. Change your mind? It's not that. I might have made staying impossible. I had some final dealings with Elizabeth Bligh. Suffice to say, if she wasn't an enemy before, she is now. She was before. But I want you at the hospital and I'll fight to keep you there. Enough to make her your enemy too? If that's the cost of doing the right thing. I didn't stand up for you earlier. I will now. What changed your mind? Something in the way you said the word "interrogate". Saw myself through your eyes. It's a very dirty word to me. Think about it. No conditions. No questions. Coming to bed? In a minute. You can talk to me, you know. What do you mean? About whatever happened between you and your father. I'm guessing it had something to do with Sarah Adams. I'm not blind. I do see when you're upset. I always have. Especially on the ship. Perhaps one day, you'll learn to talk to me. I'll see you upstairs. Sit with me? Before we got married... I was in love with someone. Someone totally wrong. It was over by the time we got together. I didn't want it to be. Do you still love her? No. Do you? No. Then why didn't you tell me? It was my pain. I didn't want it to be yours. But it was. I saw you suffer. I thought it was me. No. All this time, I... I thought it was me. No, Livy. No. I was so happy today. You're everything to me. You... and the baby. I won't shut you out again. I promise. He's gonna make it through. You know how I know? I told him you'd leave if he kicked the bucket. Ought to have a name, but. He's Boy. I reckon he's lucky. Lucky. I like it. Oh, no. I meant that he... Hmm. Looks like you've got yourself a new moniker, mate. I'll take mine outside. A bit of a chaser. You know, you're dead out in the city. Albert got himself shot down over France. Daniel never made it back off Kokoda. Never got so much as a button off their coats. Well... plenty suffered worse, I s'pose. There's a room for you here, Miss Adams. Till you get yourself settled again. Call me Sarah, Roy. Righto. Sarah. Well, it's here if you want it. The name on my passport is Bridget. That's my birth name. That's what caused all the trouble today. People wanting the truth behind it. Well, it's a nice name, that. Yeah, I changed it when I married. My husband was Jewish. When you convert, you're given a Jewish name. But I lost all proof of that identity during the war. Rene died. In Dachau. I... lived. It goes no further. Albert always loved this room. Gets the first sun, you know. You'd have liked my Albert. Come in. Alright. If you're game, so am I. Then I'll see you first thing tomorrow. So, uh, what changed your mind? I didn't think I was that persuasive. You aren't. So she explained herself? Hm. I didn't think so. I'm prepared to take her on trust. You will live with the consequences. That's it. I don't think this is funny. I'm just thinking of a question Anna asked me yesterday. Well, when you've finished amusing yourself, you can leave. Elizabeth... Go! This is not ingratitude and I don't want it come between us. But it's a risk you're clearly prepared to take. Go on. Get out! Now, whatever your problem with her, she's a good woman. A good nurse. Mind company? Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to wake ya. It's the Ashes. The first time in 19 years if the Poms take it. How are we doing? Depends whose side you're on. You sound like a bit of a Pommy to me. Don't be daft. Lucky, eh? Lucky. Morris with his face wreathed in smiles now. Sends up one to Compton, short. Outside the leg stump. Compton hooks it! And there's the Ashes. England has won, as the ball... Well, I'll be buggered.
