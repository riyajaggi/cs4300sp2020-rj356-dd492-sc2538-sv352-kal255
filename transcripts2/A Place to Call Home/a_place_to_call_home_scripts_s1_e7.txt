 Are you still worried about the risk? Because I've written to my aunt in Sydney, and she'll help us. Marry me. I will. I will marry you. This isn't about the church. I'm your child. Take your Jew name and go. I have no daughter. Go! I never want to be reminded of that hypocritical day I married the man who loves my brother. And I will respect the need to keep this between we three. But I will never respect you again.

 Did you hear the early morning news, George? No, I didn't. They've delayed the atomic test at Emu Field. Did they say why? Something to do with the direction of the prevailing winds. I trust you slept well, dear? Yes, thank you. Mm-hm. Rest and relaxation. Quite the tonic. James? Yes. Good. Does no-one else see a problem here? They're not letting off a bomb because they're worried that the wind will blow the radiation over populated areas.

 Should they be letting it off at all? - It's important we test. - Why? The atom bomb saved a lot of lives by ending the war. And how many more lives will it take in the future? Plenty, if the Russians use it. So we let the British test their bombs here? Rule Britannia. And long may it rule. George was something of a red-ragger himself at Anna's age. I was not. Certainly a lot less conservative than you are now. I hate to think what you'll be saying after a few days with your aunt. I'm sure Carolyn will be far too busy taking you to 'South Pacific' to talk politics. A musical play about a French planter who has half-caste children to a native woman and now wants to marry a nice white girl? I'd say that was political in itself. I'd like to come to the city with you. When? Today. The long journey back and forth - you have a baby to think of. And Aunt Carolyn only has the one extra room. You two could bunk in together. If you want to go, you go. James, you don't mind, do you? No. Settled. The break will do you good. George... Yes. I thought you left already. Soon. Olivia's decided to come. Oh! The whole reason for going is to ask Aunt Carolyn about precautions. How can I do that with her there? It should be up to me. No. The man should do it. If you go into a chemist asking, it'll be all around town. And who have you been seen with? Might as well hand Doris Collins a loudhailer. It'll be worse if Olivia finds out. I'll just have to find a way to get rid of her for long enough. Anna, I still think I'll save you the trip. I go in there... Gino. This is the only way. OK? Who's a beautiful Sarah, then? Careful. People will start saying you've gone soft. Oh, Jack, I've delivered lambs, calves, foals, pups, kittens, but never a baby. Let them. Eve's saying you and Sarah agreed to be godparents. Illegitimate in a country town. She'll need all the protectors she can get. We're just admiring your namesake. I've had a phone call from my aunt. My mother's in a very bad way and she's asking for me. Take whatever time you need. We can cover. Thank you. I'll take the afternoon train. She needs changing. Whew, yes, you do. I'll give Colin Walker his insulin shot on the way home. I can manage the rest. My dailies are marked. And the list for each individual day is in the top drawer. OK, scoot. I'll be back as soon as possible. Sarah? I'm heading up to the city in an hour or so, if you'd like a lift. Are you sure? Quicker than the train. Thank you. I'll pick you up at 12:00, then. He's a friend. Hm. You're not escaping. If I were escaping, I'd be on a boat home. Because I thought we'd faced our problem and were dealing with it. Our problem? Alright, mine. I have married a man who is... ..not like other men, and I have to find a way to come to terms with that. I love you. When I get back, I may want separate bedrooms. That may raise questions. We can say it's because of the baby. I get too hot. I move around. I can't sleep. Right. I am doing this to help us. I need time away to think. As long as you keep it to yourself. I have said I will. Are my seams straight? I could do that myself. You'd have to learn how to test for glucose in the urine and sterilise the equipment, but it's not hard. You taught Eve? I offered, but she's terrified of needles. Always was a sook. Very brave sook the other day. All done. What do you say? Thank you. No sign of Bert? He knows better than to show his face around here. Plus, our brother's arriving to help out. Tough, is he? A bit of a softie. But Bert doesn't have to know that. Sister, I got the wrong impression of you from things said at the house. You can't please everyone. Yes, well, I can't thank you enough. For everything. And agreeing to stand up with Mr. Bligh as godparent... It's an honour. He thinks the world of you, you know? I've got to get home to pack. He really does. I've never heard him talk about another woman like it. Except his wife, of course. Well, I've got him fooled. Yes? Yes? I'd much rather you didn't go to the city. Not today. It's a good chance to get to know Carolyn better. George is not stupid. He's going to notice. I need to get out of this house. And I need to say something to you and James which requires absolute privacy. No. George and Anna's absence will give us that. Not many people have ever said no to you, have they? As it happens. Well, I am. Olivia, this is not a ruse. What I have to say to you is of the utmost importance. I'll wait downstairs for your answer. I'm begging you. Something I rarely do. Don't crush them. I know how to put a suitcase in a boot. Just helping. Don't help. Are you intending to go dressed like that? Yes. No hat, no gloves? Look at Olivia. That's how a lady dresses for the city. I've got a hat and gloves in my bag. Suitcase. And if I asked to see them? It's already packed. Right at the bottom, isn't that right, James? I'll leave you to Carolyn to sort out when you get there. She might be able to lend you a French beret or some jazz garters. Is that all? Is it, dear? Actually, I'm not feeling terribly well. I think I'd best stay. Eminently sensible. It's horrible travelling when you're sick. Are you sure? Yes. Well, you can always come next time. Get your things out, then? Definitely? Absolutely. Aunt Carolyn will understand. You look after yourself. James, you keep an eye on her. Call me if you'd like something brought back. Give my love to Carolyn. I'll be sure to ask her about jazz garters. I'd like to speak to you both in the sitting room. Olivia has stayed at my request. It was good of Carla to step into Amy's shoes. It was, wasn't it? Gino's convinced they'll make a success of their winemaking one day. It's not a very economical use of the land. If anyone can do it, he can. Yeah, he's a good lad. So you like him? Of course I do. He'll make someone a good husband one day. What? You and your romantic novels. This isn't the way to the main road. We're on a secret mission. Not a word to your grandmother. This is breaking the silence of decades. A silence I never thought I'd break. Your grandfather enjoyed male company. At the time, it didn't seem unusual. Men and women led separate lives. Women, their households and families. Men, their work, clubs, sports. My husband was like that. A man's man. I was a young bride and naive, but certain incidents made me realise that some of his friendships were more than just that. And when I arrived in England last year... ..and I saw James and your brother... ..there was my husband. You must have wondered why I understood what I saw. I'd seen it before. These... incidents... No. The reason I'm taking you into my confidence is to say to you that your marriage, like mine, can be made to work. James's nature is James's nature, but clearly part of it allows him to father a child. As my dear husband could. We made a marriage together. It took work. It involved pain... ..compromise, but all marriages do. We found our own happiness. It has been done before. It can be done again. You should have told me. It would have helped. Perhaps. I've said my say. I think further discussion is between you. Unless you have something to say. Not yet. Does Father know? And never will. I always thought I was the freak of the family. She always talked about him so warmly. Never a bad word. What now? Do as they did. She lived it and she doomed me to it. Part of me hates her. That's not fair. Isn't it? Did all those years of compromise make her what she is? Because I don't want to end up like her. I know how hard that must have been. Was it worthwhile? Or has she fled to pack? No. I did what I thought was needed, what I hope was right. We may be needing separate bedrooms. Your grandfather and I had a similar arrangement. You'll think of something to say to the family. I best... You grew up here? It's not Ash Park, but it wasn't so bad. I raised a snob. I'm not. I'm teasing. Aunty Peg. How is she? I'm glad you're here, love. This is Mr. Bligh and his daughter, Anna. How do you do? I've heard a lot about you. You've been very kind to Bridget. Uh, Sarah. Thank you. She's given as good as she's got. Now, if you need a lift back, leave a message at the Union Club. That's where I'm staying. Thank you. And good luck with your mother. Thank you. Good... Goodbye. She called her Bridget. I noticed. Well, here's this woman who has a superb seat on a horse, can handle a shotgun like a soldier, speaks all these different languages and she can down that horrible Bert. All going to prove she's a Russian secret agent? And she's changed her name. Surely you want to know the whole story? And she might tell me, one day. But I'm not going to cross-examine her. And nor will you. She's drifting in and out of consciousness. When she's awake, she's desperate to see you. Pulse is faint. When did the doctor see her last? This morning. He didn't suggest hospital? Nothing to be done, he said. I told him you're a nurse. And she wanted to stay. I like that outfit. Let me guess. You had to battle Mother over it. Yes. God love her. She never changes. Hold this. Don't drop it or you'll see a grown woman cry. Gin, vermouth and olives. To quote the divine Miss Parker, "I do like a dry martini, one or two at the most. "Three, I'm under the table, four, I'm under the host." You'll love 'South Pacific'. And afterwards, we'll go backstage and I'll introduce you to some friends in the chorus. Her virtue will be entirely safe in their company, George. Though I'd not vouch for yours. I won't stay. We're here a few days, so we've got plenty of time. A little bird has told me that Mother's been dangling Andrew Swanson in front of you. Throwing him in my face is more like it. Don't marry him. His mother's barely tolerable and his father is a monster. Oh, Sir Henry, he's alright. Takes more than a visit to Buckingham Palace and a whack on the shoulder with a sword to cure that sort. Anna's to have nothing to do with them. I'm having dinner with him at the club this evening. Ask him if his Double Bay mistress is enjoying her new flat. Hear no evil. Don't lead her astray. Don't be led astray. 'Bye. Now, girl, I'm very happy to take you to the theatre, but what's this trip really about? Bridget? Is that you? Yes, Mum, yes. I've sinned terribly. No, no. You have to help me find absolution. Aunty Peg? Oh, yes, dear? Parish priest? Father Pat. Now. And the doctor. Yes. Let me die in God's glory. Don't let me die damned. Mum. You're the only one that can save my soul. I promised you to Him. But you became one of them that took his Son. Return to Him before I go or I'II-I'll die... I'll burn... I'll burn in Hell forever. Shh. Shh. Shh. So, you and this young man of yours are...how shall I put it? At it like knives? We've made love, yes. Has he asked you to marry him? Yes. Has he spoken to your father? We... We have to work towards that. That is so sweet. So George would find him unsuitable? And Grandmother. She finds most of the world unsuitable. We're in love. And we're lovers. And we can't stop and we will get married, but not yet, and...I need birth control. You've got to help me. I see. Please? I don't imagine there's any point in our discussing this? None. If I suggested you stop until you're safely married? It's something beautiful. Try to understand. Never fear, my doctor is a woman, not some ghastly old man. I'll make an appointment. Ego te absolvo ab omnibus peccatis et censuris, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail, Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Oh, my darling girl. Let it out. Let it out. It's just... I know, I know. You're crying for what should have been, not what is. Poor, sad Grace. Oh, my love. That was wonderful. Such a beautiful story! Thank you. The pleasure was mine. A nightcap? No, not for me. That song where Lieutenant Cable says we're taught to hate people who are different... There's a lot of truth in that. Have you ever been in love with anyone...different? Oh, you're referring, of course, to my long line of Negro and Asiatic lovers. Ha! Or are you talking about yourself? He's Italian. Oh, boy. Mother hinted on the phone that George is falling for a Jewess. And now her granddaughter's falling for a dago. Catholic, I assume. Yes. Well, I wish I could be more optimistic for you, but I'm not going to lie. Mother will explode. I know. Perhaps I will have one of those. Slip into your nightie and I'll have it waiting for you. How is your son? I wouldn't put too much store on my wife's matchmaking. - Anna knows her own mind. - Quite. Things will...take their course. Now, the matter I wanted to... ..to talk about. It's delicate. Your wife. Elaine? I understand she was killed when the Japanese first bombed Darwin. Yes. Well, since they opened their embassy earlier this year, relations have started to expand. And? There's a trade delegation coming through. And the Government is calling on people it can trust to show them what Australia has to offer. Just because we fought them doesn't mean to say we can't profit by them. And you'd like me to... Ash Park is close enough to Sydney to make a day trip possible. You'd like me to play host? To a group of Japanese public servants and businessmen, yes. Any former bomber pilots among them? Nobody would blame you if you refused. Sir Henry. Ah, Prime Minister! A pleasant surprise. Prime Minister, may I present Mr. George Bligh? Pleasure to meet you, sir. Now, George is a grazier, and I'm endeavouring to persuade him to assist with the visit of the Japanese delegation. They're going to be very important trading partners, Mr. Bligh. Any assistance you might be able to render will be greatly appreciated. I'll certainly consider... George and I were discussing the atomic test earlier. Any further word on that? Need to know, Henry. Russian agents and all that. I just hope they manage it before Vice President Nixon arrives next week. I'm going to be late. Good to meet you, Mr. Bligh. Don't play that scoundrel for money. Was trotting out the Prime Minister meant to impress me? Nobody trots out Robert Menzies. But we do want you involved in this. The Japanese are no longer our enemies. Try telling that to the people at Inverness. See, I'm not the only one with unhealed memories. A message, Mr. Bligh. Thank you. Love, you've got a visitor. Coming. I got your message. Oh. I wasn't intending to drag you here. If I'm in the way... No, no, no, it's... It's very kind. You stop your apologising. Why don't you make Mr. Bligh a nice cup of tea? Of course. The voice of reason. Through here. Night-night, love. Goodnight. Goodnight. Thank you. You've earned the truth. That's up to you. It'll help you understand this. I had a lot of pressure on me to become a nun. Aunty Peg sent me to France to visit my father's grave, to help me get some perspective away from Mum. How old were you? 19. I was standing in Fromelles looking at his name on the wall and... I just knew I couldn't... I couldn't go back. I was crying, and a man asked if he could help. His name was Rene Nordmann. Dr. Nordmann. And I met him again years later, in Spain. I was holding the hand of a dying soldier, and I looked up, and there he was. It was love at second sight. I converted to marry him, and I was dead to my mother from then on. And your husband? The Nazis. Sorry. So I never became a nun, and Mum... Mum, she lived in fear for her soul because of that. But I let her die in peace. Let her believe that I'd returned to the fold. It's a lie I can live with. I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight. It's time you went upstairs. Our bed is an icefield. Then warm it. I've done my part, you do yours. And freshen yourself. She deserves better than the stench of alcohol. Still awake? 'The Anniversary Waltz'. Darling... Either I put it in a drawer and we play it every year... ..for as many years as we have, or I smash it. That would mean our marriage is over. Which is it to be? I don't... I don't want us to end. Then prove it. Now. I missed you both at breakfast. I trust that means things are settling. We're working on our marriage. Which is what you wanted. All marriages require effort. Some more than others. James has gone riding. We both have a lot to consider. I do want you to think of me as a friend. I told you the truth, as a true friend should. Oh, Olivia, James loves you now, I know he does. How can I believe anything you say? Do you doubt my motives? Yes. Do you honestly think I would break the silence of decades for anything but the best of reasons? You've shown you'll do anything to protect the family, so perhaps. There has never been a divorce in this family and there never will be. You have lost the right to even try to dictate to me! The way you endured your own marriage was brave, noble even. But you knew first-hand about James's nature and you didn't speak. And when I think of the poor girl marrying my brother, I could weep. We're both trapped. Oh! Oh! Mr. James! Gino. What are you doing here? I come here to...think. Sometimes. I've never seen you here before. I...needed to think too. Ah. Well, I won't disturb you. Anna is in the city. Yes. Have you heard from her? What? No. I saw her... Ran in to her, yeah. I'll go. You'll be fine. A contraceptive diaphragm. It physically blocks the semen. And the spermicide you smear on it also has an effect. Like any contraceptive, it's not 100% effective, but at the moment, it's the best we've got. Hm! It's a shame you can't just take a pill. For the moment, the only pill that works is the one that you hold between your knees. Knees up. We need to make sure it will fit properly. Legs apart. Have you ever had an internal examination? No. They can be a little bit unpleasant. Just try to relax. Deep breath in. And breathe out. Just try to relax. Probably feels a little bit cold. It will be over soon, don't worry. If you wiggle about, it can pinch. Try to stay still. That's it. Deep breaths. Here is the news from the ABC read by Michael Eisdell. The first nuclear test on Australian soil has taken place at Emu Flats. The Russians ask the UN Security Council to overrule the British and American decisions on Trieste. Turn it off. Holland gets its first three female police officers. Oh, atom bombs, the Cold War, women police. Hm! Sometimes I wonder what the world's coming to. Does that mean I'm getting old? You are not old. Two world wars, a depression, four kings, two queens. I'm... I'm so tired of change. Me also. No, thank you. Mr. Bligh and Miss Anna will be back with us today. Yes. It was good of you to stay for the funeral. I wanted to. It feels like a new start. You do seem to have resolved a lot. A lot. And I'm home. That's the first time I've heard you use that word in relation to Inverness. That's how I feel now. Good. I'd like to take you on a picnic tomorrow. Just the two of us. I'm... I'm working. I can work around your lunch hour. You have to eat. Aren't you sick of me? Never. I'd like that. Thank you. For everything. Oh, I missed you so much! Oh! I came each day hoping you'd be back. I've got everything we need to be safe. Well, did your aunty understand? She could see how much I love you. I thought about you all the time. I thought about a lot of things. When I went to the doctor, I was lying there, and it was so horrible, and it made me feel dirty in some way. And I don't want to feel like that. This isn't wrong, not if we're honest with everyone. Are you sure? This ring should be on my finger, not hidden as if I'm ashamed of it. I want you to wear it. I want to wear it. I want you to. We'll have to be strong. We will be. Amy. Hello, sir! What's the news with your sister? She'll be in there a while yet. Bert did a right job on her back. What can I be doing for you? I just came over to see if there's anything I can do to help. Really? That's much appreciated. I know my brother could use a hand. Hey, lazybones! Come and see who's here! You remember Harry? Hello, James. Anything particular I missed while I was away? No. Anything particular that I missed? No. It's good to have you back. It's good to be back. George. You stayed longer than anticipated. Yes. I'm sure you had your reasons. I did. I won't be long. I'll just give the place a once-over. Uh. Help me.
