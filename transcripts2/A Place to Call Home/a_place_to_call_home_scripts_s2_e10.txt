 And this new man is, what, some misguided attempt to make George jealous? I'll be appealing to a far more potent emotion than that. Do it. I have a message for Anna. It's all her fault. You can't hurt us. I give Mr and Mrs Dago a year. Andrew, I think I'd go mad if I didn't have you to be honest with. I don't like the degree of intimacy he's assuming with you. He's been a good friend to me. Men and women can't be friends. Father's lost enough as it is, but the closer it gets, the more I think about Jack. I wish they could both give me away.

 Sarah's back. Is she alone? No. Mrs Nordmann and I are getting on with our separate lives. I suggest we do the same. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. It doesn't count if it's not in our house! Put me down! It's ours for a week. It is, isn't it? We could dine out! Stay in. We could go to the theatre! Go to bed. I'm gonna have trouble getting you outside, aren't I? We... we did it. We did. We have a lifetime of this.

 Mmm! Ti amo cosi tanto. Ti adoro. Mmm! What a beautiful wedding. I'm glad you were part of the day. As am I, darling. I was surprised to see Jack replace Amo as best man. Well, he and Gino have become close. So close? The Italians tend towards sentiment in such matters. The new generation. Perhaps. Perhaps not. See you in the morning. You sure? She was hinting at something. You had fairly spurious reasons to be up there, and we were radiating a certain glow. Yeah. You would just think that we're happy. I've always refused to name Anna's father and there we three were. She's not blind. So, what do we do? No stress, you said. Which is greater - having it confirmed or having to wonder? For her? Being lied to. For a part well played. I added something extra for discretion. I won't be here to gossip anyway. I'm on the next ship to London. I can see you in the next tawdry West End farce. Well, consider yourself a benefactor to the arts. I'll drop you near the station and then I'll head to Ash Park. And you'll, what, hurry hot and distressed to the front door? Exactly. Satisfy my curiosity. Why this obsession? George seems rather dull to me. I was 15 when we first met. He was the most gorgeous thing I'd ever seen. Elaine would never have stood a chance if I'd been a few years older. I'd have had the property, his heirs... ..his affection. She rubbed my nose in it whenever possible. I swore I'd have him one day. You missed your vocation. Your Lady Macbeth would be spectacular. If I can see this car, someone else can. I didn't mean to stay. You done good today, Mr Bligh. Don't muck it up. There we are. He's exhausted. I'm not surprised. I reckon that tea'd be brewed by now. Thanks. He has to know how much I love him. He saw how much you've given up today. Yes? Today went very well. I didn't want to retire without thanking you for aiding my rapprochement with Anna. Goodnight, then. I'm going away. Oh, well, a holiday might be just... I'm leaving Ash Park. It's time James took over the reins. It's his inheritance now anyway. Where will you go? Sydney at first. I need to meet with the accountants. Oh, George, I feel responsible... It's not you, Mother. It's not just you. It's too late at night for momentous decisions. I've made my decision. I'm sorry to interrupt. Mrs Standish is downstairs, sir. At this hour? It's urgent. She said she only wants Mr Bligh. George... Go to bed, Mother. Where is he now? I told him he had no cause for jealousy, but he insisted there was something between us. That's ridiculous. I didn't know where else to go. I can't stay there. What if he comes back? I'll inform the police. No. The scandal. Please. He needs to be punished. I just want to put this whole sorry mess behind me. I've been a fool. Here. Don't cry. Alright. Regina's having a few personal problems. She'll be staying with us for a time. I've put her in Anna's room. What sort of problems? She made a poor choice of companion. They seemed happy at the wedding. Violence was involved. I'll postpone my departure until she's feeling more secure. Departure? I'll explain later. George, I see no reason why you should tie your staying or going to Regina. I'll see to her. You'll be shocked. What's this about going? Come in. Oh. Oh, so this is the grand plan, is it? Damsel in distress? Tried and tested. This is outrageous, even by your standards! A means to an end, dear. George is no-one's fool. His morale is in tatters. He needs somewhere to focus his energies. There'll be consequences if you interfere. You coo over the baby and James all the while threatening to destroy him for your own ends. You promise me George and then renege. We're cut from the same cloth. I'll take breakfast in my room. I don't think I'm ready to face anyone yet. Your hubris will be your undoing! Our life seems to follow a pattern. In what way? One problem resolves, some other presents itself. Father leaving rather traps us here. I suppose it does. I wish we had a choice. We owe it to Georgie to stay. What? No, you're right. Ash Park is his inheritance. Darling, would you mind awfully if I dashed to the city? Just overnight. Why? With your father leaving and you taking over, it may be my last chance for a while. What about Georgie? Your grandmother will love having him to herself. And you'll stay at the hotel? Of course I will. I'd prefer if you avoided the Swansons. Your jealousy of Andrew is unfair. I am not jealous. Aren't you? Given what I offer, another man was bound to appear. How can you even think that? I'm afraid of losing you. If you only knew... What? Nothing. Is this so important to you? Yes. Then I will see Andrew one final time, to explain. You have to let me do that. Thank you. You're leaving Ash Park? I don't quite know what I'll do without you. There's nothing for me here. Where will you go? I have several options to consider. If a travelling companion is ever required... I see there's a distance to go before I have regained your full trust. Yes. You'll need friends in the wider world. It's just... It's just Roy shooting rabbits. Rene... J'adore. J'adore. J'adore. It won't be long. Oh, my apologies for calling unannounced. I have an appointment at the hospital. This will only take a moment, please. Regina is attempting to dupe George by appealing to the quality we love best in him - his decency. He may be vulnerable, but he's not gullible. He needs to hear the truth about her from someone other than me. I wish I could help. I can't. Regina made it clear James will suffer if I interfere in any way. The same threat she holds over me. She's vicious enough to do it. Well, you did intimate if there was anything you could do... And I meant it. But I've since decided it's best George and I don't see each other. He will listen to you. He still loves you deeply. And you clearly still care for him. George will see through her. Let's hope so. How can you read when you have me? I have to see if Jet Rink seduces Lesley. Or me seducing you. Don't you dare lose my page! Half of me's still listening out for footsteps at the door. We don't have to sneak around anymore. A few words in a church and what was scandalous before isn't. Sort of silly, really. Thank you. Why don't you write one? A novel? Mmm. You've read enough of them. I couldn't. You've written a diary for years. It's different! Why? You wouldn't mind? You are not Mamma and I am not Papa. We don't have to live their lives. You know, everyone expects you to tie me to the stove. Well, it will be fun showing them how wrong they are. Won't it! What did I say about resting up? I'm too old to be scolded. Not by me. You shouldn't be gadding about. Have you heard the latest news? Adam seemed charming at the wedding. No, I mean about your brother. He's talking of leaving. Believe it when I see it. Oh, his intention seems firm. So any topic which could disturb his sense of place in the family should be avoided. Including your being Anna's father. I presume that's the reason for your central role at the wedding. Please don't be upset. I've only known myself a short time. And Anna? About me, a few months. I presume you didn't reveal the father's identity because you thought I would turn against Jack. Everything he had back then depended on you. And once I'd... ..given up Anna, I thought it best to leave well enough alone. Excuse me. I'll go. Another mirror held up to me. Would you rather I left you alone? For 20 years, you could have been together, raising your daughter. But you weren't, because of me. The tragedy is I would have approved. For so many reasons. Some I'll never explain. I've always loved you dearly. I wouldn't have sent Caroline abroad. I wouldn't... I would have embraced you into the family, despite the obvious differences. She couldn't have known that, huh? I've robbed you both of a lifetime of happiness. No, no, no. You tried to protect her. Talk to her. She needs to hear it. It's better from you. That's not true. I have always done what is proper rather than follow my heart. I expected the same of my children. I forced you... No more. Though it comes years too late. Mother. Oh, thank you. Thank you. And for giving me the strength to do what I must. My solicitor, Mr Davis, please, Mildred. Well, I hope you're hungry, 'cause I could eat the arse out of a low-flying duck. Rene? Rene? Dr Nordmann! Monsieur! Attention! Perhaps... wait further back. In Australia, we stand back from the rails. That's it. Thank you. I should not be 'ere. He said, "I should not be here." It was rather unnerving. By 'here', I didn't know whether he meant Inverness or... Perhaps he's homesick. Despite how welcoming we are to those who settle in our humble environs... Thank you for your help, Mrs Collins. In Mr Collins's last years, silly thoughts crept in. Illness can weaken the strongest man's fortitude. You gave Mrs Collins a fright. I am sorry. I truly believe Inverness can be a good home. But if I've done the wrong thing bringing you here, we can go back. I am leaving for your happiness. You are my happiness. Madame Bligh, his mother... You heard? I did love George. It will pass. Je promets. We are together forever. Sorry to keep you. Father refused to learn the art of the succinct telephone call. You're in a good mood. Unexpected visits from attractive women have that effect. Here's my formal acceptance to his lordship's christening. Saves on post. I'm not sure how to say this. Shall I ask Diana to fetch me something stronger? I'm afraid I can't see you anymore. Grandmother-in-law or husband beating his chest? James... I'm so sorry. I've really come to care for you and your funny ways. You're serious, aren't you? And I'm sorry, but I must ask you not to attend the christening. James is so jealous? I can't tell him what really binds us. I will miss you. And I will never forget what you have done for me. Ever. Good Lord. You truly care for me. Andrew, of course I do! You must know that. Yes. I must go. Wait! James is a very lucky man. That is the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. Goodbye, Andrew. There's someone moving around outside. Furtively. I've heard nothing. I've been sitting up there terrified. I'll check. You go back to bed. Yes? There's no-one. It must have been one of the workers. Oh, I feel so foolish. Can I get you anything? A nightcap? No. Thank you. Well, if there's nothing else. Stay? Chat? I'm tired. Sleep well, then. I appreciate your effecting this so expeditiously, Mr Davis. Thank you for making the journey. George? The deed to Ash Park. I've changed my will. Again. I've signed it back to you. I've reserved myself a simple annuity. What about James? It will come to him eventually, but you are now the sole owner. It was wrong of me to use the property to punish you. If you think you can buy back my affections... Oh, I'm under no such illusions. More that we can continue under the same roof. It's unfair for you to undergo a self-imposed exile, so I shall be leaving tomorrow. I certainly didn't expect you to cut and run. I felt sure you'd stick it out in the end, rattling around like Miss Havisham, weeping over photographs, stopping clocks. Thank you. For guaranteeing that I'll be mistress of Ash Park. Time for sweets. Oh! What was all that cake you just consumed? Sweets for the sweet. Oh, Jack. Caroline Bligh... Please don't. What? Don't do what I think you're doing. What am I doing? You're proposing. Can you at least pretend to think about it? I'm sorry. So after the wedding, and yesterday with your mother... Those things brought us closer together, but this is one thing, that is another. It means one of us uprooting our life. Why? If I say, "Come to the city and embrace my world," would you? And therein lies the problem. Because I don't know if I can live here in perpetuity, and a marriage apart is no marriage at all. It's not a no, then. It's no guarantee of a yes. No. Perhaps it's time one of us changed. Perhaps it is. You're back. What an incredible turn-about. It's right that Ash Park comes to us through Father. And your grandmother leaving! It's like the order of the universe has changed. Imagine the house without her. I don't know if I can. Father will still need my help. Of course. We must stay. James, my home is with you. Oh, I thought you were playing tennis! You've been in a funk ever since Olivia Bligh's visit. Oh, you HAVE been up to something. I've constructed the most beautiful bomb. I'm not sure now whether I can detonate it. I trust that is a metaphor. Anna humiliated me in church. I was hoping to return the favour by doing the same to her family and letting her know she was to blame. Please, Andrew! Elizabeth Bligh's a dear friend. Oh, you and your penchant for baroque revenge! Calm yourself, Mother. I always knew it would devastate Olivia. But now... This must be what they call a conscience. I have no idea what you're talking about, and nor do I wish to. If it's such a dilemma for me, imagine what it would be for the blushing bride. Still not dressed! Well, it is your honeymoon. Get out. Did you tell her about our last meeting? He gave me even more of a reason to bear a grudge. Would you please leave? There is a cancer at the heart of your family. What are you talking about? It's all in there. If this is about James... Not directly, no. Then I'm not interested in your lies, Andrew, whatever they are. No lies. That guarantees sleepless nights whether you open it or not. So, which will it be? Worrying or wondering? I said get out. I'm leaving. Think twice next time you donate jewellery to the Micks. I won't open it. Then you'll never know, will you? They're your best results in weeks. Well, a little certitude works wonders. But I still want you to see a cardiologist as soon as you arrive. I'll be there tomorrow to wave you off. One trusts. Would you mind if I use your office for a moment with Mrs Nordmann? Sure. Uh, would you... Yeah. Uh, I'm not about to ask anything of you. But I've come to a decision, and I wanted to tell you personally. I'm leaving Ash Park, for a number of reasons. And consequently I find myself in your position of two months past, traversing the platitudes of farewells. We've never dealt in platitudes. No. I sensed when we met that you would ruin my family, and you have. It's down around my ears. But I am determined to rise from the rubble. I wish to thank you. I've lived in that house for decades, spinning a web intended to protect but weaving a rope that bound instead. I've spent all of my adult life being Elizabeth Bligh of Ash Park. I have no idea who Elizabeth Bligh really is. I look forward to meeting her. As do I. My very, very best, Mrs Nordmann. Elizabeth? I'd like you to call me Sarah. Sarah. Yes. I am yours. A smile! That's better. I think perhaps I'm getting through to him. Good on ya. I long for the day I see a smile. He hasn't since he came back to me. Soon. I'm off to Thommo's to help with the drenching. I'll be back before your shift. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Well deserved, Colleen. Thank you all for everything. I shall miss you very much. Adrift, George was vulnerable to your wiles. As master of Ash Park, I doubt it will be so. We shall see. We shall. Goodbye, my darling boy. The thought of Ash Park without you... And me without Ash Park! You take care of both the men in your life. Georgie will miss you. Little angel. I said it was just a matter of time. Keep an eye on her. I will. And be happy. Cardiologist, remember? Well, who'd ever have imagined this possible? Yes. Yet here we are. I hope your travels bring happiness. You look happy. I am. I'll make us a cup of tea. It's alright, my love. Rene.
