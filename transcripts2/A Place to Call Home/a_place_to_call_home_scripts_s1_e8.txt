 A Place to Call Home (2013â€“2018): Season 1, Episode 8 - Worlds Apart - full transcript 
 Elizabeth is rushed to hospital where Jack confirms she has suffered a heart attack. Jack tenderly looks after Elizabeth as she recovers. Heavily sedated and rambling, Elizabeth comes close to revealing a secret of her past. Elizabeth's frail health sees Anna and Gino decide to postpone telling their families about their relationship, but when Carla finds Anna's contraception hidden in her room, she becomes suspicious and confronts Gino.

 A contraceptive diaphragm. It physically blocks the semen. And the spermicide you smear on it also has an effect. This isn't dirty or wrong. Not if we're honest with everyone. I'd like to take you on a picnic tomorrow, just the two of us. Aren't you sick of me? Never. Her behaviour has been absolutely... There are explanations for everything she has done! Our bed is an icefield. Then warm it.

 I will never respect you again. - That side of you. - It's over. You remember Harry. Hello, James. That's it. Come about. Come on. Come around. Round now, that's it. Father! Come! It's Grandmother! They shouldn't have... called you. - It's a good thing they did. - It's a lot of fuss. Mother? We found her collapsed. - How serious, Jack? - Serious.

 - Just put me to bed. - We need to get her to hospital. - No, my own bed. - Mother, Jack is the doctor. Oh. Oh! - I'll be perfectly fine. - Elizabeth! - Go to the hospital, please! - Elizabeth, listen to me. Listen to me. Do you want to die? Because if you stay here, it is a distinct possibility. Lean on me. Come on. It's alright. Sister! Emergency. We need a wheelchair outside. - You're back. - Yes. - We're bringing Elizabeth in. - Her heart? Yeah. Hey, Col, stop mucking around and make yourself useful. Grab a plank. They're too heavy. Slacker. What did those poor old ants ever do to deserve getting fried? They're why you're pulling that down. White ants, you silly galoot, not that sort. Leave them be. Go on, scoot. He's fine where he is. Run and get Mr. James a drink of water. I don't need one, thank you. Go on, mate. Oh! We used to be friends. We're not kids anymore. We weren't kids then. We were young. It wasn't my idea to come back. Someone's got to help. You're not worried I'm going to... I don't want to talk about it. OK. Ever. You haven't wondered what I've been doing all these years? Can't say I have. James! Grandmother's been taken to the hospital. What? What's happened? I'll explain on the way. Miss Anna. Harry! Oh, my, I... I didn't even recognise you. It's been over five years. I'm sorry, I can't... Go to your gran. I'll see to the horse. I'll fetch him later. James! I'm not here to cause trouble. James! Will I put this laundry away for you, ma'am? Oh, yes, in the dresser. You should be eating. It's good for the baby. I'm not hungry. No news from the hospital yet, but do not worry. I am sure things will work out for the best. Yes, I hope so. How is she? She's, uh... she's finally settled. And? She'll pull through. Thank you, Jack. What caused it? Well, she's a woman with a heart condition who keeps acting like a woman without one. And the treatment? The only remedy is rest, and more rest. And no stress, so I want to keep her here to guarantee it. Can we see her now? I think it's best if you come back in the morning. Take Anna home. I'd like to stay for a while. Alright, not too long. She's sedated. I ask you not to disturb her. Of course. I'll let you know if anything changes. Thanks again. This is ridiculous. All this fuss. Don't excite yourself. It's entirely unnecessary. How is she? Bad, but better. Good-o. Your horse is round the side. See you at home, then? Amy's back there somewhere. She's been worried. Help Miss Anna, Col. Just so you know, I've never told anyone about us. I never will. Good. What are you so scared of? I'm not scared. You're something. I'm married. Amy said. I won't lie. Sometimes I wondered what it'd be like to come back. You shouldn't have. I'd like to hear a bit about your life. I can tell you a few things about mine, you know, normal things. Normal? Are you married, Harry? No. Step away from the car. Have you spoken to your mother yet? No. Papa's in the shed. What is it? Grandmother's had a heart attack and she's in the hospital. And all I want to do is hold you. This is all wrong. Cara... Dr. Duncan says she's not going to die. But she's so sick. We can't tell about us, not now. The only thing that matters is your nonna. OK? You just have to be patient till your nonna can take the news. The shock, you mean. Smile. Better. Miss Anna! Mr. Poletti! It has to come at the right time. Just remember. OK. Why Miss Anna come here? Some bad news. I would say nothing, of course, but others may find it highly irregular, one of yours standing up at a christening. One of mine? You understand, Miriam. A Jew? Exactly. Jesus was a Jew, Doris. Oh, no, dear. Jewish? I don't think so. I know Sister Adams performed a miracle with the birth, but Eve's got quite carried away, asking her to be godmother. Miriam. Oh, Sister Adams. Back from the city, I see. Mm, this morning. Oh. Sarah, I was so sorry to hear about your mother's passing. I wish you long life. Thank you. Oh, yes indeed. My condolences. Yes, well, um, it's my day for the CWA newsletter. Oh, perhaps you might distribute these amongst the female patients. Such kvetching over a christening. You're going to be the baby's godmother, yeah? I was asked. Who thought I would say such a thing? But Doris might have a point. It could make a scandal even more a scandal, no? Perhaps. What's brought you here? Come in. Oh! Alma said you'd gone. It was so mad here this morning I completely forgot to ask how you're holding up. Are you OK? Yeah, thanks. Uh, Miriam Goldberg's hoping to see you. Problem? It's about Guy Fawkes Night. Oh, yeah, right. That's crept up on us. Leah has a rough time of it. Did Miriam explain? A little. Send her in. Elizabeth, she'll be alright, won't she? She's out of the woods, yeah, but she'll be in for a while. I will keep my head down, then. Good on you. We're in the same boat. We're both the last thing her blood pressure needs. Excuse me, Mr. James. Do you mind if I put the room in order? Of course. I have not had a chance to say yet how happy we are to see you back, looking so fine and with such a beautiful wife. Thank you. And Miss Anna. She must have had some handsome young suitors in England. Anna? No. So there was no special young man for her while you were travelling? Grandmother just introduced her to a highly eligible chap. To very little effect. Excuse me. Mm. Yes? Miss Anna. Carla, you don't have to call me "miss". Here, yes. No, that's silly. I've come to ask if there's anything before I go. No, thank you. And thank you for this morning. I don't know what we would have done without you. Now you must try your hardest to make your grandmother a happy woman. Mr. James tells me Mrs. Bligh has chosen a handsome young man for you to marry. Ah, him. Well, there are some things I won't do, not even to make Grandmother happy. Miss Anna... Anna! I put your laundry away in the top drawer of your dresser, if you're looking for anything special. Ciao, Mamma. Take a load of your feet, huh? You must be worried about Mrs. Bligh. How do you know about Mrs. Bligh? I saw Anna when she was out riding. I see. Just by chance. Accident. George. How are you? Are you alright? It's been a shock. She's sleeping like a baby. She's in good hands, but if there's anything I can do to help... Thank you. I'm surprised to see you here. I was just seeing how things went so I could hit the ground running tomorrow. Have you finished? Yes. I'll drive you home. I'd like that. Sleep. I refuse to die. I refuse to let you. Hm. You're a good boy. So like... So... Oh, I don't like it. Disagree. Nor do I. If I've said anything... Whatever the stoush, you'll come through it. Always. I would never hurt you. Never. Not like your f... Like? So like him. If a broad-minded person like Miriam Goldberg's reacting like that, it's hard not to wonder. I've been having doubts about our involvement as well. Considering Bert's attitude and... Yes. Perhaps we could talk about it at the picnic tomorrow. Oh, I-I thought we'd postpone. Why? Because of my mother? Yes. Like you said, she... she's in good hands. Midday outside the hospital, if that suits. I'll get cook to rustle up a hamper. You getting chauffeured around these days. This town only needs one gossip, and Doris Collins has the position filled. Where have you been? Why? I heard Anna's voice ages ago. You must have been back for some time. Why didn't you go to the hospital with Grandmother? I didn't want to get in the way. It showed a certain lack of concern. Yes. I won't be going to the hospital. At all. Of course you will! I think it's for the best. You have to. I refuse to stand there pretending I care. This is ridiculous. I can't be so hypocritical. Whatever you feel, you have to do what's right. Like your grandmother did by me? Olivia! I said no. How can I explain it, then? I'm pregnant. Say that I don't need the stress of seeing my darling grandmother-in-law suffer. What has got into you? I'm simply prepared to admit what you must have thought. We'd all be better off if she died. That is utterly poisonous. And utterly true. You know, it wasn't until I met you that I truly appreciated a beer on the veranda after a long day. Nothing beats it. Cheers. Oh! Did you know George Bligh's wife? Fine woman. In what way? Just about every way you can imagine. Has he courted anyone since? I thought there was room for only one gossip in this town. I'm not gossiping, I'm... I'm just interested. A bloke's not blind. I thought you and I were of the same mind when it come to people's past. It's their right to tell it as they see fit. My thoughts haven't changed. Well, something has. Blood pressure is down. Good. Yes. You still got pain? Oh, a little. Nausea? Dizziness? No. I thought I'd been forgiven. You're a lot more reasonable when you're sedated. Jack, what are you talking about? We had an entire conversation you seem to have forgotten. I was assuming I'd been pardoned. Oh, I see. Well, I don't intend to be held to any drug-addled ramblings. It made a lot more sense than this lemon-lipped act. Either we clear the air or I'll transfer you to the city. You need rest, not tension, Elizabeth. Might I remind you, it was your defying me over Sarah Adams that helped put me here. I gave you some well-needed home truths. You gave me insolence and ingratitude. OK, that's it. City. No, I'm not going! You need a doctor who won't upset you simply by being there. I'll get you another sedative and arrange a transfer. Jack, after all I've done for you. Just stop! If I took your blood pressure now it'd be way up again. You're killing yourself. Now please. I don't want to go elsewhere. And I don't want to send you. Give me a choice, huh? I remember lying in the gutter - literally - and you reaching your hand down and saying, "Trust me." I did, and you saved me. Let me return the favour. # When the moon hits your eye Like a big pizza pie # That's amore # When the world seems to shine Like you've had too much wine # That's amore... # Angelo Poletti. I'm going to ask you a question, and I want an honest answer. What is happening between you and Anna Bligh? How can you be engaged? If it's a secret, it doesn't exist. It's a lie. Don't say that. We're in love. Everything we have, everything we owe to that family. We were going to tell them, you and Papa. But Mrs. Bligh got sick. That's your excuse? It's not an excuse, I swear. We were going to tell everyone. Tell everyone what? That you've been doing unspeakable things? Is love unspeakable now? I found something in her bedroom, a vile thing the Holy Father forbids. It's not what you think! Move! Or do you want your papa to know what you have done? He's going to know when Anna and I decide to tell everyone. Your father's lost one son. Think what it will do to him to lose another. Mamma, listen to reason. Do you really think they're going to let you marry? Why not? You're a Catholic. Her family won't allow it. The Church won't allow it. Someone like her is not for you. She thinks she is. It's my mother who thinks I'm worthless. Carla! Nothing. Do you hear? Nothing to your father. Si, caro. I'm coming! You're looking much better this morning. Well, I don't know why. I'm being woken every hour, and I'm on a mattress that harbours who knows what infectious horrors. You gave us such a fright. Olivia sends her apologies. She's... not feeling well. She wishes you a speedy recovery. So, Olivia unwell. What else? Nothing of any consequence. Anna? Nothing of consequence either? No. You sure? Harry's back! Who? Amy's brother. Harry! And you should see him. He is a lot different to when he left. He's staying as long as she needs the help. Oh, Harry. He wasn't up to much, as I recall. Didn't we let him go, George? He moved on. Well, there you are. No to be relied on. James, you keep an eye on things. Make sure Amy has what she needs. I will. Well, I can't imagine what nonsense you're all getting up to in my absence. The same old boring things. You've got a suspicious mind. Hm. Methinks you all protest too much. The one thing about your mother, she is shrewd. I felt like a ten-year-old with a secret. Blushing and in short pants. Well, we both know if she got wind of this, she probably would die. Sorry, that... I make my own decisions. And... And if it wasn't for her heart, I would have no hesitation in telling her. However, I didn't invite you here to discuss my mother. I've been contemplating the problem of the christening. Oh, yes. Well, we both know Eve invited us for sentimental reasons, which is understandable, but we're not the most appropriate of choices. What do you suggest? Amy and Harry. I could say I feel awkward cutting them out, and we could both keep a protective eye over the baby. An elegant solution. Thank you. Under different circumstances I would have liked very much to have shared the honour with you. So... here we are. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Carla, have you seen my blue neckerchief? No, miss. Carla's in a strange mood today. I hadn't noticed. You should come to the hospital tomorrow. It really isn't that grim. The baby comes first. Grandmother's quite cheery. I don't like hospitals. Is that all it is? What else would it be? We don't share things like we used to. There's nothing to share. It's all about resting for the baby. Alright. It's nothing you've done, Anna. Well, as long as it's not. It's not. Enjoy your ride. It's a beautiful spot, isn't it? It's lovely. I used to come here a lot with Elaine and the children, before she died. In the war. I'm sorry. I never imagined that was how she was lost. Where was she? Australia. Oh. I was stationed in Darwin. I thought Elaine and the children would be safe with me. We were on high alert after Pearl Harbor, but no-one truly believed an attack on home soil. I was walking across the street. Elaine was on the other side. You saw it happen? When the first bombs hit, she started to run towards the hotel where the children were. She was there one moment, and the next... I ran towards her, but... She was a wonderful woman. I miss her. I've not met anyone I've admired in that way since. Until now. Gino! Our luck is changing! Anna. Things couldn't be better. What has my mother said? Nothing. Father and Sarah are having a romantic picnic, and if he's seeing her then he has to understand... Anna, Mamma knows. She knows. She guessed. She forced me to tell. She's forbidden me to see you. Didn't you tell her we love each other? I told her we're in love, we're engaged. She hates it, all of it. As soon as your nonna's better she's going to tell her and your father. No, no, no, I have to talk to her. Anna, listen. Wait. Stay. Who knows what will happen? Here. We're from such different worlds. Yes, we are. Grandmother asked me to check on Amy again. What are you doing? You think me monstrous for what I said about your grandmother. Yes. With her, it's a family dominated by an iron will. Without her, just look. Your father, so full of warmth. Anna able to marry for love and not as some trade negotiation. You and I. Go on. What would we be if she died? The other night, when you made love to me... ..was it on her orders? Was it? Livvy. You want to know what would be different if she died? I would know my husband was making love to me of his own volition. And I'd know our child was being born into a house where there was some vague hope of love. My family was supposed to be the easy part. Hm. She couldn't see it at all? No. What if she changed her mind? She won't. She would, if my father agreed. A nice dream. If he's in love with Sarah, how can he say no to us? But they're different. Well, he's rich, she's poor. He's Christian, she's Jewish. It's all about class and religion, just like us. I don't know. I do. If he fights for her, he'll be fighting for us without knowing it. I'll make it happen. Grandmother wants me to keep an eye out for Amy, so I'll be dropping by from time to time. Good. I'm a married man. I heard you the first time. Good, then, is it? Being married? We're expecting a child. I'll see you tomorrow. I owe you an apology. I've spoken to Gino. Not here! It's OK. We're alone, I've checked. It was wrong to keep it a secret, and I am sorry for that. But I won't apologise for how I feel. This is the ring that Gino gave me, and this proves that we're engaged. Not in the eyes of your family. Not in my eyes. We're in love. What you want is impossible. Why? You must marry into your own church. You must marry a rich man and live in a grand house. Gino will never be enough for you. He will. He is. Would you change your whole life for him? Would you change your home, your religion? I would do anything to be with him. You are too young to understand what you are saying. I've always loved Gino. Always. Even when we were little and playing together. What else is there to understand? I can't approve of something so wrong. And what if my father approved? No. What if he did? That will never happen. But if it did. If I can convince him to accept us, will you? You mean can I? After what you did. It would be an honour for any mother to have such a daughter-in-law, even knowing of your sins, but it will never happen. Anna... it cannot. So you would go against my father? This will only lead to heartbreak. I'm putting Gino's and my happiness in your hands. And you can give this back when you can give us your blessing, and I know you will. One day. Now, all I ask for is time to make my father understand. A month, no more. And what you have in your drawer, you will have no need for that. I promise. At least you show shame. One month. Oh. I wouldn't presume to intrude, Mrs. Bligh, but the ladies of the CWA asked me to deliver these. Oh. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. Thank you. I won't stop. You need your rest. I'll get my Alma to put these in water. I knew it couldn't be anything dreadfully serious. The way Mr. Bligh was chatting so cheerily to Sister Adams as they passed me. Sister Adams? Yesterday. Giving her a lift home, I presume. No doubt. Indeed. Yes, well, if it's up to the good wishes of the town, you'll be back home in no time. Livvy! Come here. Nobody told me to do this. I love you. I hate seeing what this is doing to you. We will get through this, I promise. So, who's going to break the news to Eve about the christening? Perhaps we both could. I'm sure she'll understand. I heard Doris invaded. Oh, she did. I'll make sure she doesn't make it through next time. Oh, she's harmless enough. Hm. Anything you need? I'm fine. It's good to see you settling. Well, what sort of person doesn't listen to their doctor? I can't imagine. Actually, Jack, there is. Something I need. Or someone. Would you be kind enough to make a telephone call for me? Long distance. What's wrong? I don't care. What?
