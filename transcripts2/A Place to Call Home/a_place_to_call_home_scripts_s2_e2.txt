 I hope you won't mind if I leave you both alone for a few days. No, no, by all means. Mrs Regina Standish. Mrs Bligh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to stay away for a while. No! Any progress we make with James, you undo with your displays of distress. I've come to talk about our daughter. Who is she? Where is she? I... I...

 Well, is she here? Overseas? I can't tell you. Why? Not yet. Why not?! Look at what you made me do! Colin, what have you done? Come on. Are you right with what we've done? We saved more lives from being ruined. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. Tue-moi! Kill me! Anything I can help you with, Mr Briggs? Um, no, no, I'm just passing. It's always good to pop in for a prayer. The flowers can wait if I'd be disturbing you.

 No, I'll just go and say g'day to the missus. Such a dab hand with pastry was your Millie. A loss to the CWA. Hey, for her. Thank you. A bucket of water would greatly assist. I'll be inside. I'll just leave it at the door, if that's alright. I've got mucky boots. Oh, yes, yes, of course. Indeed. Ah, Miss Adams. Doris. I've just come from the church. I saw Mr Briggs there looking for all the world like a lost soul. Really? I suspect he's missing your company. A single man, a single woman. In spite of a difference in years, affections form. There are some who say you've broken his heart by accepting Mr Bligh. There are some who need to padlock their tongues. Oh, indeed, indeed. I only know he wasn't himself. He wasn't himself at all. Well, I know that look. I'll put the kettle on. Thanks. People are starting to wonder. Doris Collins is starting to wonder. Bugger Doris Collins. The best way to get on is just to act like nothing's happened. Yeah. I went to church to say a prayer for him. Well, I couldn't even walk in. We did what we had to. Every man deserves a Christian burial. It was burial for him or the law for them. I know. My boy Daniel died on Kokoda and he's up there somewhere in the mud. There's no cross, no prayers, no blessing. It's haunted me ever since. Drove the old girl into an early grave. You've got my silence, but... ..we done to Bert what I blamed God for doing to my boy. You're a good man, Roy. It don't sit right, Sarah. You know it don't... ..no matter what you say. So, when we come into the church, we bless ourself with holy water in the sign of the cross. You do it. That's good. It will become second nature in a little while. So, you are here for your first instruction in the Catholic faith. Are you ready? Yes. Yes. So, some of the things that we do and believe will seem a little strange to you at first. Do you see that little cupboard on the altar? We call that the tabernacle. In that, we keep the reserved hosts - wafers consecrated during the Holy Mass. Now, we believe that during the consecration, the bread and wine truly become the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. You're saying God actually changes bread and wine into flesh and blood? If he can create the universe, Anna... Now, come with me. No, Mother, I'm not dashing off. Why do you ask? Well, I want to spend time with James and Olivia so I'll be leaving for the city on Sunday after matins. Matins! Oh, that takes me back. Now, it's known you're visiting. You'll be expected in the family pew. Are you coming in? No, I haven't got time. And it may encourage Anna to join us. The longer we can avoid her publicly aligning herself with the papacy, the better. What are you up to? You say you're here to meet Miss Adams? She'll be there too, I hope. Ah. What? Stop making mischief. I'm not aware that I am. She's a Jew. I'm well aware of that. And religion is a weapon that you can use against her. Differences exist, Carolyn. They cannot be ignored. So, can I count on you? Good. I shall see you then. It's his way of coping. He'll come out of it. He was just trying to protect me is all. If I hadn't made Bert angry... It's not your fault. I suggested going on a picnic and Bert just bowled up, said he was going. I tried to stop him and... Eve, you were upset. ..he just went crazy hitting me and calling me horrible names! Eve! Eve! You had no choice. You know that. At the very least, Colin would be sent to a reformatory. And if they decided that he was lying to protect you, you could hang. People will believe Bert's gone away. Act like he has, alright? What if he's missed? We will face that if and when we have to. Alright? You know where I am if you need me. Before you go... ..I found this in his swag. It's 1,000 quid in a cheque from Mr Bligh. What should I do with it? Why would George give Bert money? Eve? What he saw. Harry and Mr James. There's no need to look so alarmed, Mrs Bligh. I made inquiries after we ran into each other and found out James is a patient. I was there seeing a friend. I'm here to help. Help isn't required. I assume it's some sort of breakdown. I don't know what to say to you. Don't be concerned. They were discreet about his condition. I don't know the details, but I am here to help in any way I can. I don't understand why. An investment in my possible future. We may all be family one day. You're that interested in Anna? I'm being badgered to marry and she's the only vaguely interesting candidate... ..which sounds less than romantic, but... you understand. So, if I can help, discretion is assured. Thank you. And perhaps you'll trust me with the full story... in time. You asked for me? I want... I want to go home. I see. Now! Now! There's no need for agitation. I just... I just want to... I just want to leave! I'm sure part of you does. The deviant side wants to flee from the treatment that will see it gone. I can leave if I want to. There, I'm afraid, you're wrong. I came here voluntarily. Your father and your wife signed you in. You cannot leave without their consent. I want to see them. I want to see them. That is not... not possible, James. I just want to leave. Relax. Your kind lacks moral fibre, James, and I'm here to provide it for you. I can't stand the pain. The confusion. After the treatments, I don't know who I am. But you know who you're not. You are not the deviant within. We will defeat him... together. A nurse will bring something to settle you. I won't breathe a word about what they did. Tell Mr Bligh. I will. It's our shame too. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm thinking about selling up, leaving. Colin won't forget here. Do you have somewhere to go? My cousins will set us right. Amy's all I'd miss. I'll give Mr Bligh his money back. No! I'll tell him Bert gave it to me before he left. No, it would raise too many questions. We can't even say we know about it. Use the money for Colin's education. He's bright. He'll go far. But you're right. Not here. 64. Looks like I've won again! I'm attempting to make you feel comfortable. Oh, I see. Perhaps I'm a natural. Your sister has agreed to join us at church. It might help to allay idle chatter if Anna could be there also. She's taking instruction. Yeah, she is not a Catholic yet... Nevertheless... ..and I hope never will be. Your father must be rolling in his grave. Surely it's enough worrying about what the living think, Mother. Oh, if you'd care to accompany us, although you may feel a little uncomfortable at a Christian service. This Sunday? Yes. Of course. Well, I understand if your faith precludes it on a regular basis. Of course, as George's wife, it would be expected, normally. Mother. We can't tiptoe around these matters, George. Well, if we're mixing faiths, I should go with Sarah to the Goldbergs tomorrow. You're more than welcome. It's for Shabbat. Really? It's Hanukkah, which makes it particularly special. I think Father just did another spin in his coffin! There's no need for poor taste, George. If you'll excuse me... I've been waiting for a chance to speak with you alone. I was at the Walker farm today. Bert's gone. Has he? Good. Eve mentioned James. She assumed I knew. Mr Bligh, what are you doing out of bed? Come on, now. Don't do anything foolish. Orderlies! Orderlies! I'll need a sedative. No! No! I want to go home! I want to leave! You can't keep me here. You can't keep me here. No! Get off me! Get off me! Let me go! Olivia knows? She's a tower of strength... ..working with James to help him overcome it. What if he can't? She asked that too. If I'd been different... ..after Elaine died... I left him to Mother. It's nothing you've done. You must know that. You sound so sure. I've known many men like James. This turns my stomach. He's your son. Mm-hm. Well, I'm here if you need to talk about it. The only offensive thing I know about men like James... ..they were murdered in the camps for who they were, along with the Jews. Amen. Amen. Amen. So, she chases me down the street. "Mr Gold! Mr Gold! I want to wish you a happy Hanukkah." "Hanukkah?" I say. And she says, "Yeah, it's Christmas for Jews, "only not so festive." Who are we to question Doris Collins? Greater men have tried! Not necessarily successfully, though. Not at all. I appreciate you giving me the chance to better understand Sarah's world. And now you have your own nation. Israel is only five years old and has many enemies... ..but with or without her, we will survive. Our faith will sustain us. And so many of us have just died for it. Thank you, Amy. Is anything the matter? No, ma'am. Sit down. Oh, no, I couldn't. Indulge me. Come a little closer. Clearly, you've been crying. My sister Eve is leaving. She says it's because her Bert shot through. Hmm. Well, she's well rid of him. Ma'am, if you'd rather I left too... Why should I? I'm a reminder of what happened between my brother and Mr James. Amy, what you are, my dear, is a loyal and very valued member of this household. However, if you wish to leave, I shall write you the best of references and ensure that you secure a good position elsewhere. No. This is home. Thank you. Please excuse me. Of course. Excuse me? Visiting hours are over. Sorry. I imagine Dr Duncan's left for the day. No need. You're in luck. Thank you. Jack? Jack? Maybe he snuck out when I wasn't looking. His place is just round the corner. On second thoughts, I won't bother him at home after a busy day. If not before, I'll see him at church on Sunday. Maybe get the chance to talk then. Sorry to bother you. We should thank Mother for trying to score that point. I might not have gone otherwise. Well, I'm glad you did. So am I. Last night and tonight, the talk of the camps... You were a Jew in France at that time. One day, I'd like to know. I'd rather we concentrate on the future. Mm-hm. Goodnight. Goodnight. When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in this... A Jew? Where's the lightning bolt? Carolyn. Sarah. Shh! ..and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Dearly beloved brethren, the Scriptures moveth us in sundry places to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness and that we should not dissemble nor cloak them in the face of Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, but to confess them with the humble, lowly, penitent and obedient heart to the end that we may obtain forgiveness of the same by his infinite goodness and mercy. Meet me at three where it happened. We both need it. Oh, Jack! Can't stop. Sorry. Well, it can't be anything so urgent. Clearly, there is. Well, it's very rude of him not to greet you after all these years away, unless it's something that we've done. Apart from trying to steal away his best nurse. I wish you luck with that! Here she is. We were just talking about George trying to make you a member of the idle rich. I wish you luck with that. No wonder you have trouble with her, Mother. She's just like me. Must you? I must. Let's dispatch Mother to the city and then we'll have a good chat. It stuns me she's going and yielding you the field. She'll be back. I'd love to know what the old tinker's up to. Thank you. For what? I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. I'm simply observing the decencies. Lunchtime! Already? Your mamma wants it now in case Jack arrives early for Gilda. I know what I want for lunch. Come on! One kiss! No! Just one. We can't. No-one's watching. Father Joe says God's always watching. You want me to be a good Catholic wife, don't you? Well, not too good. Come on. Eh! Shirt. We shouldn't really make jokes like that. Like what? About God, Father Joe. It was just a joke. I know, but God's listening. Do you really believe that? Of course. You really believe God's listening to what everyone says? God is everything. What if I can't believe that? Well, you will. But what if I can't? A lot of what Father Joe said seemed sort of silly. Don't say that. Never say that in front of my ma and papa. I wouldn't, but if I can't be honest about it with you... You will try your hardest, won't you? It's for you. Of course I will. Well, then... you will believe. Yeah? Car's waiting. George, I'm rather enjoying your sister spending time with us, but would you invite her here while I'm away? I'd like her to feel part of the family again. I'll see what I can do. And if she asks, perhaps you could say I'd be pleased to find her still here when I return. Why don't you tell her? I think it might register more coming from you. I'd be happy to. Right, well, I'll telephone when I've seen James. Shall I give him your...? Encouragement? Naturally. George... ..and your love? Whatever abhorrence we share for James' nature, we must never lose sight of that. He was the most dreadful snob as a boy! He spent his childhood chanting, "I'm the king of the castle "and you're the dirty rascal!" Our George? He grew into his egalitarian ways. I was just saying how elitist you were, brother dear. Don't listen to a word she says. She is absolutely right, but someone had to compensate for your ragtag ways, my darling. Please sit down, both of you. I have enjoyed our brief time together. You always enjoy our brief times together. I mean it. Miss Adams, I shall see you upon my return. You will. She invites you in, then scarpers. She's definitely up to something, trust me. I am sorry to bother you on a Sunday, Doctor. He doesn't mind. Do you, Jack? Sickness doesn't recognise weekends. Painful? Mumps. Well, you've all had it so no-one's at risk. Bed rest and aspirin for the pain and fever should see her right. Miss Carolyn! Mamma! Si, tesoro! Vengo! Got to dash. Ignoring me is one thing. Avoiding me is childish. What do you expect? Better than this. What's left to say? Unless you want to say who she is. So, there's nothing to talk about. So, how was mass? What was that about? Oh, nearly had a bingle earlier. Told him to brush up on his road rules. So, mass? Well, I was a pretend Anglican and now I'm a pretend Catholic. It's easy to change a belief you never had! Hello. Ah, there's the person I should be meeting. I've ordered tea. Oh, thank you. I'm parched after that long drive. Well...? I'm leaving tonight. I already have investigators at work in Paris, London and Berlin. One thing that can be said for the Nazis - they kept meticulous records. And £1,000 should suffice? No expense spared, you said. I expect results well within three months. Splendid. So, how is it having her under your roof? She's assimilating too well. George needs to see her in the context of the wider world. Why do you think I'm here? First, James and Olivia and then I have some arrangements to make. The patient's grandmother is on her way. I thought no visitors. She's clearly unfamiliar with the word 'no'. Get him cleaned up, tidy up the room, a bowl of fruit and some fresh flowers. And heavier sedation. I never thought I'd say this, but I'm so glad you're here. I felt rather alone. I do understand. You've shown great fortitude, which can only serve to strengthen James's resolve. How can it, when I'm not permitted to see him? The doctors know best. They treat me as if I were a liability. The medical profession can often be undiplomatic. We're spoiled by Jack. Right, now, perhaps if you wait here... No, I'm coming in with you. Oh, Olivia, you must not get yourself worked up in a state. Being fobbed off by them is one thing. I will not be fobbed off by you. Very well. But you must promise to abide by the doctor's decision, whatever it is. What if he tries to deter you? I must repeat, we usually restrict visitors at this stage of the treatment. Well, I fail to see how assuring James that he has my full support could be counter-productive. Then you need to be prepared. To the untrained eye, his appearance is confronting. Mrs Bligh was unable to contain herself. It is very distressing to see him like this. But it is all part of the process. The worst thing for James would be for you to curtail his treatment based on an emotional reaction. You misjudge me, Doctor. Rest assured, James will see a calm, smiling face. Very well. Yeah, but only you. You understand. He appears to have been burnt. We are administering electroshock therapy and we'll be moving on to aversion therapy - an emetic administered while he's shown images conducive to arousal. I see. I know what you must be going through. I think not. It's alright, darling boy. I've come to visit. James, James. I'm so proud of you, James. Why is he so heavily sedated? The conscious mind of the invert resists being challenged so we sedate him after each treatment to allow the subconscious free rein. Now he is getting agitated. This is what I was concerned about. James, James, shh. It's alright. I insisted that I see you, but I promised not to stay. Will you be strong, my darling? For Olivia and for the baby? James? Love you. What did he say? Sounded like, "I love you too." You are to be congratulated for putting the patient's wellbeing ahead of your own understandable distress. You do understand that your grandson cannot move beyond his malady without a level of discomfort. Well, I rely on you, Doctor, to keep his discomfort to a minimum. This is the 1950s, Mrs Bligh, not the Middle Ages. What did James say? Something I rarely hear these days. Have you broken down or stopped running? I deserve that. I do understand. You can't. Not without knowing a lot more than you do. About...? Me. But I'm here to hear your story. I'd always had a crush on you. I used to wait for your visits to Mother. I had no idea. I was shy. You? Shy? I was then. So, I was desperate to see you when I got to uni. I thought I had to work to get you. I did love you. Truly. I loved you. I would have stood by you. And lost Mother's support? We'd have managed. You were a brilliant student. You relied on her. I wasn't going to risk that. Well, I should have had the choice. My life is peppered with 'should haves'. So, I disappeared... ..I had our child and gave her away and here we are. I did it all for you. But you have every right to be angry. I'm just heading out to visit Roy. I promised him a cup of tea. Would you like me to drive you? No, no, the ride will do me good. I've just started drawing up a guest list. For...? Our engagement party. While the cat's away... I thought a bush dance. A bush dance? With a bush band. A refreshing change from the string quartets that normally grace our parties. How would your mother feel about that? I think she'll be happy not being swept into a Pride of Erin with the locals. Aren't you early? Hurry back. Soon as I can. You do like the idea? I love it. It's brewed up things for me too. I was in the Resistance. I shot a wounded friend. It was that or leave her to be tortured by the Gestapo before they killed her anyway. If the right outweighs the wrong, no matter how wrong... ..you'll face your God again. Eventually. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven Give us this day our daily bread And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us And lead us not into temptation... What if our daughter hadn't found out about you? She did. Yeah, but if she hadn't? We wouldn't be here. I'd never have known. No. There ARE reasons. Yeah, so you keep saying. I need more. No. I deserve more. I can't. It's my right to know her. Please... ..tell me. Who is she? If you ever loved me... Anna. My Anna. Our Anna. Mrs Bligh, what a pleasure. Andrew! Elizabeth's come to visit James. Do sit down. Where are you staying? Well, here. Not any longer. Mother sent me to insist you be our house guest. I insist you join her. Oh, I'm not sure that would... Olivia tells me you've been very understanding. About James? Mm-hm. Of course. Some sort of rest cure, yes? Thank you for your discretion. Actually, I was intending to visit your mother so your invitation's very timely. To see her for...? A private matter. It's perfect, then. Did Olivia happen to mention I'm storing pennies in heaven to aid my cause with Anna? No, she didn't. I've decided to press my advantage. I'll pop down to Ash Park once you've settled in with Mother. Well, perhaps not for a few days. We need to give Anna plenty of notice, don't you think? Instruction. Father Joe. Coming. I promise not to go blundering in with her. Thank you. I'm moving into the main house while Mother's away, if you want me. I've only had one conversation alone with her ever. Recently. A railway station platform, of all places. Thank you for trusting me. Finally. Better late than never. Yes. I'll look after the place till you sell. You've done enough already. You'll never get your price if it goes to the pack. Good luck, lass. You look after your mum, eh? Try to forget this ever happened. Won't be easy. Do it for him. Bye, sweetie. Colin? Colin? You were protecting your mum. You did nothing wrong.
