 You've done a good job at keeping that side of yourself from George. Feel free to scurry to him again. I can fight my own battles. What you've achieved in one day is nothing short of miraculous. It augurs well for how you'll manage with George. We wouldn't want him suspecting collusion. Just so you know, I've never told anyone about us. Step away from the car. No, I love you. I love you, Sarah. But you will help me, won't you?

 If you are pregnant, perhaps. It's very complicated. What am I going to do? Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. I'm getting bigger by the day. Hmm? I'm expanding. Perhaps it's twins. It might be triplets. Stop it! Yes? The hospital called. They're discharging your grandmother. Regina and I will collect her. Best you're here when she arrives. And remember, calm and relaxation is her best medicine. Of course.

 You will try? It's been so wonderful without her. For me. You know it has. Please. We've come so far. We won't lose what we've gained. Oh, before you go... Queen Elizabeth has summoned you. She's in the garden. Ah, Sister. Mrs Bligh. Take a seat. I doubt Dr Duncan would want me here. Your refusal is much more likely to agitate me. It's Jack that I wish to discuss. He told me what happened after the reception for the Japanese. What did he say? That he drank, a lot, and that you looked after him. Is there more to tell? No. Well, he assures me it was an aberration, not a return to old patterns. He hasn't been tempted again in the last week, but he will bear watching. Of course. And given my current incapacity, I would appreciate your assistance. You seem to have some influence over him. He's lucky to have such a good friend in you. I would prefer it if you would resist any need to sentimentalise. Perish the thought. Doctor? Yes? Your house call with Sister Adams? Right. She's in the garden with Mrs Bligh. So I can count on you? Yes. Good. That will be all. Mrs Bligh... Nothing further needs to be said. Oh, other than to thank you for so assiduously avoiding me during my stay. It did help. Before you say anything, she asked to see me. Why? Personal matter. She thanked me for keeping out of her way while she was here. So no olive branch, then? A very withered one, if there was. Yeah, right, well, uh... You ready? Yeah. You've been home for days. Gino. I've waited, I've thrown stones at your window. Mamma says you won't even look at her. Please. You want Andrew Swanson. I heard him at the reception, talking about seeing you. It's not how it seems. I told you to trust me. How can I? I didn't want to tell you unless I had to. And I tried... I tried to make it go away. I did everything that I could to lose it. Anna? I'm pregnant. A lot better. You can get dressed. Here. When you say better...? With the lung healing well, and now she's not contagious, she can start going outside. Wunderbar! Oh, Leah, you hear? To the movies? Sarah, we can go. Dr Duncan, you come too. You don't need me tagging along. And that's a ways off. Just a small walk each day. But when we do go, you must come. First you must learn to dress yourself. Oh. Here. I've gotta go and discharge Elizabeth. You right here? Of course. I'll let myself out. This Friday, you must join us for Shabbos. Sarah, yes? Yes. Doctor? Both of you. Please. Friday. Uh, no. Friday's bad. Um, finishing off the week. But thank you. I'm sorry. For what? Not trusting you. We must not hurt our baby. It'd solve everything. No. It would. It's taking a life. It's a sin. I couldn't be with you if you did that. Ever. Promise me. I promise. We tell them. We marry. Saying we want to marry is hard enough. Saying that we have to marry... What else can we do? It would kill my grandmother. Then what? There's one thing we could do. If Aunt Carolyn agrees. And those are to be taken... With food. Not chocolate. Deprived of even the smallest pleasure. Complete rest. We'll make sure of that. Won't we, George? The sitting room's set up. She only has to manage the stairs morning and night. I am not a total invalid. But you're not well. She'll want for nothing. Oh, I would prefer the dignity of walking out of here. I can see you're going to be a handful. George? Oh, Nurse Grey, thank you for my care. My pleasure, Mrs Bligh. I'll commend you to the board. Sister. Mr Bligh. Homeward. Doctor? Yes? Miriam's invitation. It isn't every day a goy gets invited to a family Shabbat. Yeah, it's a shame I can't go. You're very rarely here late on a Friday. If it's to do with me... Why would it be? You've changed since yesterday. It all came back last night. There's no need to be embarrassed. I was thrown at first. And then flattered. Under different circumstances... Don't... Let's just leave it there, eh? Can I ask you one thing? You're back on the wagon... This won't change that. Please know you can always ask for help if you need it. It's good to have you back. Mmm. Olivia, you've been well? Yes. Welcome home. Oh, it is good to be home. And you, miss. Gallivanting about in the city... I wouldn't have gone if you'd minded. You had better things to do than hover around my sick bed. Andrew? We've had fun. I hope your aunt is behaving herself around him. She makes him laugh. I'm sure. I was thinking of going back there tomorrow. If I'm not needed. You go and enjoy yourself. And now rest, I think. Anything you need, you let me know. Oh, I will. I'm being spoilt. Reggie, would you stay, dear? Of course. Don't fuss, dear. Just sit. Sit. Of course. Your staying - it's really not necessary. But you're still convalescing. You have yourself to think of, a life to make, without your late husband. I'm very happy here. I thought you'd be grateful. I am. I asked you to maintain the status quo and you have. I'd make him a good wife. Perhaps. Perhaps not. Neither of us is under any illusion about the other, I think. Elizabeth, I'm asking for a chance. I am very grateful for what you've done, but I think not. I see. The right man is out there for you. Somewhere. I'm looking for Mr Bligh. Senior. He went riding, ma'am. Over towards the west paddock. Saddle me a horse. Now. Yes, dear? You've been premature. In dismissing me. There's a limit to what you can control when you're lying there. Is there something specific that you want to say to me? As you said, you don't need my help. I said I don't need a daughter-in-law. You may be far closer to getting one of those than you imagine. I'd best start packing. Regina. You know something. What is it? It's a quid pro quo world, dear. I'll help if you don't stand between me and whatever affection I can foster in George. Tell me. Say it. You may stay. Whether your charms have any effect is up to George. I saw them at the guest cottage. Him and the Jew. They're rutting at Ash Park. How long before she's living here? Uh, case files. Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow. You got a minute? Uh, it's about the other day. It's not really necessary... Please. I, uh... I remembered all of it. What you said too. Ravensbruck. I know you're loath to open up about your past, but you did, to help me. Thank you. It's not something you share easily. When people say how sorry they are for you, they can't imagine what it was like in one of those places. They're right. They can't. No. I was lucky not to die. Most of the time I wished I would. Maybe that's why I fell in love with you. Someone who would understand? You deserve better than being my emotional crutch. You're my friend. And I'm yours. You were seen, so do not add to the indignity by trying to deny it. This is not good for your health. Well, you should have thought of that before you embarked on this sordid affair. You have to stay calm. That rather depends on your response, doesn't it? Well? Who saw us? What does it matter? Well, they put your health at risk. They betrayed me. What matters is that you end it. What if... one of the staff had seen you, or one of the workers? So it was one of the family? What were you thinking? Honestly, George. Her? And here? If you wanted to wallow in the mire... That's enough! I care for Sarah. I'm sure you do. But there is no future in it. The sooner it ends, the better. If you want to send me to my grave, then continue. Mother... No. I've had my say. The rest's up to you. Go and make your choice. Your family or your lust. My love. Hm. James? Have you been out on the property? We moved in one of the flocks. From? The gully. So you didn't pass by the old cottage? No. Why? Someone has upset your grandmother. I haven't spoken to her since this morning. Could you ask Olivia? If she did say something inappropriate, I'm sure it was unintended. Of course. But if it was her, I'd appreciate it not being discussed any further. Thank you. - The cottage? - Mmm. No. I didn't leave the house, in case Elizabeth needed me. Why? It's not important. I'm not just here to help your mother. You've been so generous. I... I can't thank you enough. As long as you need me, I'm here. What's the cottage have to do with it? I don't know. I haven't said anything to her. Not even inadvertently? I am doing everything I can to avoid her. I am not about to go scurrying with tittle-tattle! I didn't mean... I am trying my best, James. Father is very upset. Not even a day back and she has us fighting again. Things will settle. I need to get away. We can't. I won't have our baby born into her pit of poison. Don't make me go without you. I expect at least one telephone call with all your news. Of course. And give my best to Andrew. Now a word with your father, privately, please. I'll see you outside. Have you reached any conclusions? I think my attitude is perfectly clear. Some time away will make you see sense. Does that woman know what's happened? Sarah doesn't need to know until we resolve something. You know my feelings for Sarah are no reflection on my love for you. Oh, spare me the platitudes. It's true. If you choose her, there will be consequences. Understand that. Where were you? Just thinking. Everything's changing. What makes you say that? We're all so different from the people who came back from England. Don't you think? You're very serious all of a sudden. Father... What? Anna, was it you who said something to your grandmother? No, I told you it wasn't. Then why so grim? Hmm? Nothing. You sure? Mmm. I was just being silly for a moment. It doesn't matter. To the city, Jeeves! What are you doing here? Your dad's given me a few days work. I thought he would've told you. No. That's alright, isn't it? Of course. You haven't been over. I've been busy. That all it is? Yes. I was worried you might be angry I worked at your party. Why would I be angry? No reason. Your wife's pretty. She's beautiful. She's a lucky woman. You're a lucky man. You were gone early. I had work to do. I didn't mean to issue you with an ultimatum last night. I understand what you're saying. I wouldn't leave without you. I love you. But please. Please consider it. This is my home. My family. We are your family too. It doesn't have to be forever. I'll carry it up. I can manage! Are you trying to get rid of me? You're late. It's fine. Tell Carolyn I'm sorry I had to dash. I'll see her next time. Have you told George yet? I tried to tell Father earlier. And I couldn't. I was too ashamed. So what are you going to do? Well, that's why I'm here. I won't arrange an abortion for you, you know that. Gino won't let me anyway. He's a good Catholic boy. Of course not. So now you're the only one who can help me. And please don't say anything until I've explained it all. Alright. We could go away together, just you and I, just before I start showing. Europe, maybe. You could say you're studying or painting or something and that you need the company. We'd stay away long enough until I've... had the baby and found someone to take care of it. And no-one would ever have to know. And then... and then I'd come back and Gino and I would convince them to let us marry when the timing's right. And... and maybe we could even go back afterwards and... and get the baby. What? Nothing. What? Excuse me. Did you get your envelope? No. There's an envelope with your name on it. I wasn't here. I don't know who left it. Thanks. Gesundheit. Sit, please. I wasn't sure you'd come. Is this about Dr Duncan? No. Although, looking back to our little chat yesterday, I do find it rather extraordinary. In what way? That you could look me in the eye while we were having it. I know. About the affair. In your state of health this isn't a conversation we should have. Which is why we'll keep it brief. George says he loves you. Do you love him? Yes. Then you will leave him before you ruin him. You know you will. Why else have you worked so hard to keep it a secret? We did that for you. Oh. And when I die you'll announce it to everyone and live happily ever after. You are completely unsuited. You must know that. I didn't want this to happen. Oh, then you should have controlled yourself. I mean this - you, upsetting you. You have to know there is no future in it. I know that I love him. Selfishly. Or you would finish it now. If we do, we'll do it together. I will not stand idly by and let it happen. Please excuse me. Do what you know is right. Keep your eye on her. Call Dr Duncan immediately if there's any sign of pain. You care? I'd wish her dead in your shoes. Of course you would. You know, don't delude yourself. George might take a Yid as his whore, but he's never going to marry one. Hello? Who's there? Harry? What are you doing here? Wh... what are you doing? Harry. Stop. Stop. Livvy? James? We should go. Pardon? To the city. You were right. We'll leave as soon as possible. Thank you. What was it that I said? How many times do I have to tell you? Nothing. I saw you. What was it? I can't. Please. Alright. You sat there and told me my story. That's exactly what happened to me at your age. I fell pregnant, Mother sent me away to avoid a scandal, and I gave birth overseas. You asked me to do for you what had been done for me. I had no idea. Yeah, well, that one's been locked away in the family vault for a very long time. Whatever else made me the black sheep of the family, that was the start of it. But who knows? Your grandmother, uh, George and Elaine did. That's all. Who's the father? I'm the only one who knows that. And it will go with me to the grave. Even he doesn't know. About the baby? Yes. What happened to it? She... she went to a good home. I'd rather not... Of course. No wonder you went pale. So will you do it? The same? For me? It's more complicated than you can begin to imagine. We'll see. Breakfast? That's Carla's job. Which, I hope, makes my doing it mean all the more. Here, please. I'm sorry about our misunderstanding the other day. I don't think either of us misunderstood a thing. I am going to try to make George see me as more than a sister-in-law. I can't stop you. And if I succeed... I think that's a conversation for another day. I'd like you to place a telephone call for me. To my solicitor. Alma's concerned her cold might be contagious. So if you wouldn't mind filling in on the wards today... Oh. Yes. You right? It might be an idea if you look in on Elizabeth later. Why? George and I have been... meeting. Meeting? Oh... yeah, right. I'm sorry... No, hey, we've sorted all that out. Mmm. He's a... he's a good man. He is. It won't be easy. It won't. And Elizabeth knows? She does. You've just given her a whole new lease on life. She's gonna survive just to spite you. Are you sure this is what you want? Would I have said so otherwise? As your solicitor, Elizabeth, I have to say that in your current condition... I know exactly what I'm doing. Now, go away, draw up the appropriate papers, and bring them back for me to sign. Mr Bligh... Mr Bligh does not retain you. I do. This is a huge change. Exactly. Thank you again for coming at such short notice. I believe you know the way out. Good morning. Good morning. Come with me. Where are we going? Please just come. This is where I came to decide whether or not I would give my child away. You're about to make one of the biggest decisions of your life and there are some things I know that might change the way you think about it. Yes? Oh, I've thought so many times about this moment. If I don't do it here, now, I suspect I never will. I don't understand. The child I had, my darling, the child that I gave away to be raised by others... ..it was you. It was your grandmother's idea. Your father was happy to embrace it. Elaine and I went overseas and came back with a daughter, ostensibly theirs. I've never suspected. Not for a moment. They loved you as if you were their own. Why would you? Please don't... Please don't hate me. Why would I hate you? For not being strong enough. For giving you away. Don't. I took the easy way out. Anna, listen to me. If you still want to go ahead with the subterfuge, I will support you completely. But if you really love Gino, and you both want the baby... ..don't make the same mistake that I did. I've regretted it every day since. Fine. I'm not even gonna bother with the usual spiel about stress. It would seem rather pointless. I assume you're on her side, as usual. I'll defend her to the hilt as a nurse. But you have an opinion. She's one of the finest women I've ever met, Elizabeth, and if she'd have me, I'd marry her tomorrow. But she loves George. If you gave her a chance, I reckon she'd surprise you. Oh, I doubt it. Times are changing. Could be time you changed too. Family duty is a constant. George isn't the only Bligh who's been asked to put it first. You? I ask nothing of him I haven't asked of myself. What if he can't give it? I've always loved you. Thank you. Now I love you even more. I'll marry Gino. Then I will have the baby. Good girl. You're my mother! Are you hungry? Starving. I think something's happening. There's been a lot of coming and going. Sarah Adams, Dr Duncan, and a funny little man who looked like a character from Dickens. Grandmother? She seems fine. I hope it's not her health. The worse she is, the harder it's gonna be to break the news. You're not having second thoughts? No. A whole new start. We'll leave it all behind us. I love you. Oh, you're back early. How were the sales? We did very well. How's your health? Surviving. Don't stand there like a naughty schoolboy, George. Come in. Let's discuss things as adults. I do worry about your heart. If it kills me, it kills me. And since that's your opening gambit, I can only assume I won't like what I hear. I'm hoping you'll understand. And as that's your second gambit, I doubt I will. You intend to choose her over the family? Why does choosing Sarah exclude you? Very well. Let me tell you of my decision. If you even think of marrying this woman, Ash Park will go to James. I beg your pardon? I've changed my will. If you persist with this folly, everything passes on my death to James. You can't be serious. You can have Ash Park or you can have her. You cannot have both. What sort of man do you think I am? The sort of man who puts his mother in an impossible position. George. George! George? George! Mr Bligh. I need to talk to you. You'll be fine there, Mrs Howard. Are you alright? I love you with all my heart. Marry me. What? Marry me. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru.
