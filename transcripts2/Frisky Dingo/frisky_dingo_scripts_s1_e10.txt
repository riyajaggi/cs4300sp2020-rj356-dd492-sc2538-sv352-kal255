Oh, but first check out this haircut! I am tidy for Babar. - Holy crap! - Oh, my God. Everybody, thank Ken. So he looks a little bit like Crews, but... Lisa Lisa, this is my friend Ken.

[Gasp] Though I'm afraid ll can't say the same for that wing-ed collar. My God. Well, well, well. Heh heh heh! If it isn't Xander Crews. - NEARL: Yes. - STAN: Excellent. Or so it would appear. Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh. Whoa. Sorry. - So... - NEARL: Yes. As it turns out, I couldn't have you declared legally dead after only 3 days. Obviously. - Shut up. - Right. - So what say we do the DNA test? - XTACLE: Oh, what--what is this? - DNA test. - XTACLE: We don't need that. Have to make sure this really is Xander Crews and not some sort of elaborate switcheroonie.

I am also awesomely-- No. I am-- I am also obviously-- [Coughs] Sorry. Ahem. What's happening, guys? STAN: I am also obviously awesomely effing leaving! So. Wow. Uh, where to start. Summer 1977. Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody was playing on everybody's 8-track as a nation slept in fear of the "Son of Sam" killer... [Gasp] And mourned the loss of our favorite son, legendary rock and roll icon Elvis Aaron Presley. Holy crap! Why are our heads still blowing up? That's on me, guys. Sat on the remote. - We should put that in a cabinet... - Yeah. And like-- - that your fat ass can't fit in. - Oh. Everybody just...OK? And like Elvis, Xander Crews had an identical t-win. - A twin? - Twin heirs to the vast Crews fortune left behind by my murdered parents. - Oh, my God. - Yeah. It's cheddar. But there was trouble at Crews Manor. One son was born profoundly retarded. [Jabbering] I don't want to go to the monkey hospital! No! But Nearl want to stay with mommy and daddy and brover Xandy. No, Xander. He's dead to us. Wah! - Now who's for Denny's? - Grand slam! - Oh, my God. - And they never came to see you? Not even at Christ-mas. Mr. Ford, what is Santa bringing for Nearl? He's gonna bring you an enema if you don't stop shaking those presents. Enema. Sound it out, Mr. Ford. Enema. Aah! Merry Christmas, Nearl. Back at you, Mr. Ford. Oh, my God. That's so freaking sad. - NEARL: Yes. Here you go. - I'll take it. Thank you. But the asylum was a pic-i-nic compared to life on the mean streets of...town. But I want to stay forever living in the hospital with you, Mr. Ford. - Hospital closed, Nearl. - Uh-oh. - Now I got to go work in a damn pet store. - I'd like that. And you can thank Ronald Reagan ass for that. Thank you, Ronald Reagan. Your legacy is intact. But thanks to you and your mysterious brain chemical, we shall savor the sweet nectar of revenge as we rise up as one man and destroy my brother Xander Crew-- [Gasp] Thanks, Ken! - Ronnie! - What? What is wrong with you? Hey. What? I do you favor. - That's why we can't have nice things. - Come on, guys. Thank you, Ronnie. Is complicated enough without all this evil twin bull [beep] having. You know what? That is-- Actually, that's a pretty good point. Good for you, Ronnie. Yeah. That was complicated. So if Xander Crews really is Awesome X, then where is he? [Speaking Chinese] - So, hey-- - Barnaby, hush. - We won't get supper again. - You ever wondered what we're making? No. I wonder why you won't shut up. - I think it is telephones. - Barnaby! Hey, look--look. Can you feel this? Say hello into this phone. - Stop it! - [Gasp] That's 3 nights running, Barnaby. And tonight is Sloppy Joes. - Thanks a lot. - I'm sorry. You can have my bun. - I'm literally starving to death here. - Oh. I can hear your tummy. [Sniffs] What is that? What do--I smell a radish. [Speaking Chinese] Aw. He wants you to have his radish. Well, thank you. Barnaby, tell him thank you. [Speaking Chinese] See if you can make it sound slightly sarcastic. Mm. Save some for my birthday, put a candle in it. Oh. Why don't I just eat a candle? [Speaking Chinese] But why is old spice giving me radishes? He says it's something to... something the father of i--iron legs. - The father of who? - It's either legs or feet. [Speaks Chinese] Well, legs then. Excuse me. Two weeks I've been taking Chinese. Simon was wearing robot pants. They're not iron though. Well, a train's not an iron rooster, but that's what they call it in China. - CHINESE MAN: Ha ha ha! - Really? Ask him if he knows where Simon is. [Speaking Chinese] - What did he say? - Oh. That's just crazy Chinaman talk, man. - Barnaby, make those words English. - IKind of think he said, "death rabbits.” [Cheering and booing] [Speaking Chinese] [Chanting Chinese]
