 Oh, hey, good! Big shout-out to the Xtacles. Arroo! Couldn't have done it without you guys. Oh, that was nice. God, I wish we had TiVo. Oh, now you want TiVo. You'll finally be retiring. Is that accurate? No. Ever--ever vigilant. - I am a beacon of...vigilance. - OK. Also a beacon of fighting. - And now that you're retiring-- - I'm not retiring.

 For Force 10 News, I'm-- Thank you. . I'm.. - Thank you, city. You're awesome. For Force 10 News, I'm Grace Ryan. And I am Awesome X! Yeah, who started a rumor Awesome X is retiring? - I may have... - Stan? ...on behalf of Awesome X, issued a press release. Yes. CREWS: What the hell did you do that for? Because now that Awesome X has defeated all the supervillains in the city-- - Ka-kow! - It's time Xander Crews got focused-- Lame. ...On running his huge multinational conglomerate. Now, all that superhero nonsense was all well and good-- Nonsense?! Stan, I was avenging the untimely deaths of my murdered parents... Who were murdered. - Yes, but-- - Stan, hang on. [Telephone rings] Telephone. I'm blowing up here. Go. Go time. [Continues ringing] [Sighs] - Go time. - Operator. Yeah. [Ringing] Go time. - GRACE: Hi, baby. It's me. - [Sighs] Did you see my interview with Awesome X? - Yes, I did. - GRACE: Well, what did you think? - Uh-- - GRACE: I thought it went great. - Can you hang on a second? - GRACE: OK. - OK. Click. - [Dial tone] Ho ho ho ho. Oh, my God, she's gonna be mad I did that. I don't even know why I did it. [Dial tone] Do you think I'm selfish? - [Horn honks, sirens wailing] - Are we still on for tonight? Xander? I guess the network's down. Uh, I've got 6 bars. - Me, too. - Yeah, me, too. Are you people gonna load out or dick around with your phones all day? - 6 bars. - [Sniggering] STAN: That will be all, Watley. WATLEY: If there's anything else I-- STAN: Get out! CREWS: Damn, dawg. What's all this bidness? STAN: That's exactly what it is-- business. STAN: P&L;'s, balance sheets, earnings estimates. CREWS: And why is it on my desk? Because it's time you learned how to run a business. And the first thing you're going to do is fire the Xtacles. [Gasps] The Xtacles are the backbone of the Awesome X Fighting Force. They're also a $5 million annual drain on the company's bottom line. [Scoffs] Is that all you care about, Stan, the bottom line? - Yes! - CREWS: Well... unless we all of a sudden lose $5 million somehow, - I'm not firing my dawgs. - Damn it-- And... I have to go ride in my limo. ♪ All that cheese ♪ ♪ (Hey, all that cheese) ♪ ♪ Tell you how it is ♪ [Cell phone rings] Go time... Except if it's Stan. - Hey, baby. It's me. - Hey. - You know what I was thinking? - Uh-uh. Now I won't be covering those crazy battles between Supervillains and Awesome X all the time, and now I can really concentrate on us. Huh? I mean talk about... [Jackhammer drowns out voice] ...maybe finally unfreezing some of your sperm. You--When did you freeze my sperm?! - Oh, I always do that. Ha ha. - What?! Well, we can talk about that tonight. See you at your place at 7:00. [Phone beeps] ♪ Taco supreme ♪ ♪ Super head, tell Bill Maher ♪ ♪ I'm coming for you, baby ♪ - Yeah, baby. - CREWS: [Grunting] Oh, yeah! Yeah, baby. CREWS: Oh! This is so wrong. - PROSTITUTE: Oh, God! - CREWS: Oh, my God! - PROSTITUTE: Oh, yeah. - CREWS: I'm with a prostitute. Yeah, come on, you big black son of a bitch! Oh, yeah! CREWS: What?! - CREWS: Where did that come from? - PROSTITUTE: What? CREWS: Oh, no. Don't stop. I like it. PROSTITUTE: OK. [Groaning] - ELECTRONIC VOICE: Granted access. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - PROSTITUTE: Oh, don't stop! - Shut up, hooker. GRACE: Xander? Baby, you up here? GRACE: You have got to move that crazy suit of armor, before it kills somebody or--aagh! What--what are you doing here? Xan--uh, Billy-- Xander Crews said I could use his place for this... - GRACE: He-- - CREWS: ...hooker. - GRACE: You know him? - We went to college together. No, we didn't. Get out of here! He will be at your place in one hour. - GRACE: I just--I-- - CREWS: No time, woman. CREWS: He despises tardiness. You should know that. Go! Get out! Oh, sorry. Bye. Oh, my God. 1 did not mean for her to see this. Xander Crews. Oh, let's go back to the black-- big black guy thing. You're Awesome X! [Gasps] Oh, boy. STAN: $5 million?! - I had to pay her off! - STAN: Damn it! Well, I can't have some blabbity-mouth hooker running around with my secret identity. That's the first thing they teach you. STAN: Nobody cares about your secret identity. It's to protect my loved ones. You don't have any loved ones! [Gasps] Stan! What, who? The girlfriend you treat like dirt? Your murdered parents? CREWS: Oh. STAN: And you can say good-bye to the Xtacles. - What--what?! - STAN: What what? You just spent their entire salary for the year. Oh, see, I knew you were gonna trick me into doing this! Me?! You're the one who paid $5 million for a blowjob! I.. It was a half and half... First of all. Second of all, OK. I'm going. [Sighs] Awesome X to Excalibur, I'm on final approach. XTACLE: He's coming. Everybody in position. [Guns cocking] Yo. Where the hell are you guys? XTACLES: Surprise! Ambush! [Screaming] [Making laser sounds] [Screaming] Go time, mother-humpers! Awesome! Awesome! Bring it, you cyborg sons of bitches! What are you doing?! It's a surprise party. [Clears throat] Do what now? 'Cause we love you. [Groans] Well, why the hell were you pointing those damn guns at me?! [Bubbling] XTACLE: We got them at the party store. Hey, guys, hey! Check this out. L1 will open communist China to the West. Put that back. Oh. I thought you wanted to kill me 'cause I came up here to fire you. XTACLES: What?! Yeah, take a knee, gang. But the Crews Company funds the entire Awesome X operation. So, you know, take it up with Xander Crews. - XTACLE: Let's kill that son of a bitch! - ALL: Yeah! - CREWS: No, you know, let's-- Let's don't-- - XTACLE: Kill him! He's a good guy. We don't kill good guys. We kill bad guys. Come on. - XTACLE: So, uh... - It's in our charter. What's up with our 401 Ks? - My retirement! - Yeah, what is up with that? [Groans] - Oh, what the-- - That's my nest egg! We're still gonna have health insurance, right? Oh, my God! Health insurance, I need that! CREWS: Ahem. Mm-mmm. - Oh, my God! - What?! - Are we at least eligible for Cobra? - What, the little... The G.I. Joe dolls? No. Not the G.I. Joe dolls. Oh, that reminds me. Give me the... The--where it is? Kevin made you this-- We all kind of helped-- Before you shot him in the face. Oh! You guys! [Gasps] CREWS: Guys, is this... l mean, this is-- - XTACLE: Yeah, it's sculpy. - CREWS: It's awesome! XTACLE: Well, we all kind of helped. CREWS: And I think I just found a way to save our jobs. XTACLE: Mmm... Except Kevin. - And Mike. - Uh, both Mikes. CREWS: Oh, Fat Mike, too? [Harrumphing] STAN: Order, please, gentlemen. Order! Now then. First item on the agenda is-- [Can jingles] Mr. Crews! CREWS: Hey! No, no! Don't get up. - CREWS: How's it going? How's every-- - [Harrumphing] CREWS: ...body doing? Weird. So, Mr. Crews, this is certainly a surprise. Yeah, I bet. But I'm here. I'm here to run the company, So... - MAN: Harrumph! - CREWS: Hey! Hey, buddy. And also, um... [Opens briefcase] From now on, we're doing this. STAN: I'm sorry? "Cause I converted all our factories over to making these little guys. - You what? - [Harrumphing] Whoosh! Wha! That's him flying. - CREWS: What?! - STAN: Doll factory?! You said if I can make the Awesome X brand a profitable part of this company, CREWS: I could keep on doing whatever I want. No, I didn't. - Well, you implied it. - No! - Hey! - 1 did not! Tone of voice! Look, I don't care what Boys From Brazil thing you got going on in there, but I'm still the boss in here. And we're making Awesome X dolls, and they're gonna kick so much ass, you'll probably go blind. And if you still have a problem with that, there's the big-ass door. You're not gonna sell doll one without a villain, you ninny-- A Cobra to your G.I. Joe; a Stretch Monster to your Stretch Armstrong; a Decepticon to your Autobot. I'm one step ahead of you, Stan. CREWS: Check it. Oh, sweet mother of God. Hi, Mister-- [Coughing] - STAN: Watley? - Yeah! No, no. This monster man is? - The Dread Lobster. - CREWS: The Dread Lobster. - STAN: What? - He's a supervillain for Awesome X to battle so we can, uh... drive the sales, Stan. - Thoughts? - He's an abomination! What! It was his idea! Which, looking back, l1 guess I really didn't think through. Keep 'em up, buddy. Chicka-chicka! Why is he so pale? Oh, why are you so pale, Watley? I think maybe my body is rejecting the claws. CREWS: Well, cut it out. [Coughs] CREWS: Watley? Watley? Oh. Is he dead? He's damn close. Take his neck pulse. - STAN: That's what I'm-- - Don't go into the light, Watley! - You imbecile! - Hey! - Hurtful. - Sit down! 250 years this company has been in your family. And from slaves and small pox blankets to soft-core porn and semiconductors, it's always made a profit. But with one fell idiotic swoop, you've ruined it. I'm just glad your murdered parents-- My murdered parents wanted me to be happy! And this can make me happy, Stan. [Sniffles] Fiscal sales of Awesome X dolls. Nobody is going to buy a superhero doll without a villain to fight! Well, then I'm kind of at a loss. Unless... - Oh, what about this guy for the villain? - STAN: What? My man? - When did this get here? - CREWS: Uh... Apparently, it's been here the whole time.
