 [**] [Dana] Cannonball! Deinosuchus? [***] Sara, you won't believe it! I just saw a Deinosuchus under the water! Its name means "terrible crocodile" because it looked like a huge crocodile. It's going now. But maybe it'll be back. Sara? Sara, are you okay? Sara! Yes... I'm fine.

 [Dana] Are you gonna jump? Uh huh... [Dana] When? Great cannonball, Dana. I liked your form. Head down, legs in, maximum splash. Sara! You're holding up the line. [sigh] [***] [**] You're gonna have to let go of that railing sometime. You can do it, Sara! [whispered] She's probably not gonna do it. She's scared of heights. Hey, Sara, I used to be scared of heights, but then I read a quote from a great philosopher that changed my life. He said, "Just don't look down." [Sara gasps] Huh. I've never seen anyone belly flop without actually hitting the water. Do I have to jump? Oh, only if you wanna pass this swim class. [hissing and groaning] [hissing and groaning] [***] [**] Hey, seester... You okay? Uh, yeah. I'm great. I have an idea how to get you down, but I need you to act like a... - Dinosaur? - ...dinosaur. Remember how I told you I saw the Deinosuchus under water? Yeah. Just like crocodiles today, it spends some of its time in the water and some of it on the ground. And guess how it moved on the ground. - Like a crocodile? - Exactly. So why don't you turn around and crocodile-walk back to me? Or I could just live up here... [gasp] ...forever. Seeeeester... Great! Now crocodile-walk. Would it help if I made crocodile noise... No. Thank you. Your loss. I do a great croc call! Croc! Croc! It's all in the throat. [***] You did it! Not really. I didn't jump. You coming? I'll meet you down at the bottom. Cannonballlll! [***] Spinosaurus! [***] [squeak] There's a Spinosaurus? Is that your mom down there? I think she's looking for you. [squeaking] Are you afraid of the water? It's okay. Paleontologists think that, just like the Deinosuchus, you spent a lot of your life in the water, too. Maybe that's why your snouts look the same. [squeaking] [gasp] [***] [**] Good job, baby Spino. Sara, you wont' believe it! Sara? Sara? [***] [**] [***] Dana! Sorry, couldn't help myself. - I'm never gonna pass. - That's not true. You just have to get over your fear of heights. Easy for you to say. You're not afraid of anything. That's not true. I used to be afraid of dinosaurs. What? I didn't know that. Yeah, when I first heard about them, I thought they were big, and scary, and mean looking, especially the T-Rex. [roar] But when I started learning about them, I realized they were super-interesting, mostly because they survived on being big, and mean, and scary looking. Well, I don't think learning about heights is going to help me get over my fear. No, but when I get scared now, I pretend I'm a dinosaur. It works every time. Is that why you roar sometimes at night? I'm a little bit scared of the dark. C'mon. Dino diving school is about to begin. Thanks, Dana. What are little seesters for? [***] So what's our first lesson? Lesson number one-- the Deinosuchus. The Deinosuchus got into the water just like crocodiles today-- by crawling in. It helps if you make their noises. Croc! Croc! - Croc! - Croc! Croc! Now go! Croc! [giggle] Woohoo! [giggle] Weeeeeee! Woohoo! [laugh] Woohoo! [***] I did it! And it was only kind of scary. - Good job. - What's our next lesson? [***] [**] Lesson number two-- the Spinosaurus. [hissing and growling] [hissing and growling] Spinosaurus got into the water by walking on its massive legs. I... didn't know that. Tell me more. Quit stalling. It's Spinosaurus time. Now walk into that water, Spinosaurus, and remember to roar! [***] Roar! I did it! - That was great. - What's the next lesson? Uh oh. [***] Unfortunately, there's no dinosaur that would've dived into the water this high up... Uh, that's okay, Dana. Let's go back. BUT there were pre-historic winged reptiles that would. [screeching] [***] The Pterodactylus would dive into the water looking for yummy fish to eat. I can't do this. You can't... but Pterodactylus can. Happy fish hunting! [***] Squawk! [***] [**] Squaaaawwwwwk! [***] [**] You did it! WE did it. Squawk! Nice jump, Sara. The squawk was a bit weird, but other than that, great job. You passed your level one. [sisters] Yes! [***] [dinos screeching and roaring] [Dana] Next up, more Dino Dana. [***] [Dana] Dino Dana! [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] Dino Dana! [roar] [Dana] "A Game of Microraptor and Mouse." [***] [Dana] Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak! The microraptor sees the bait. The microraptor is a really fascinating dinosaur, mostly because it's the first dinosaur ever discovered to have four wings. Two on its arms and two on its legs. They called it microraptor because it's tiny but it's also a super skilled predator. Hopefully it will use one of those skills on my bait. [chirping] Come and get it, Microraptor. I'm so tasty. Come and eat me. He spreaded his wings. Looks like he's about to take off! Come and get it, Microraptor. [squawks] He's gliding! Squeak, squeak. Squeak, squeak. Dana, it's freezing in here. Sorry, microraptor. What was that? Sar, the microraptor was just about to get in here and help me solve dino experiment 504, how did the microraptor hunt its food. Oh, that explains where my sock went. Yes... The microraptor was one of the smallest dinosaurs ever found. It only weighed as much as a pigeon. What does that have to do with my sock? I'm trying to see how it hunted so I made an Eomaia. Plus, it already had a hole in it and it smells really bad. No, it does not. Oh... okay, you can keep it. So, about this Eo... Maia. It's smaller than a pigeon, which would make it the smallest dinosaur. Ha! It's not a dinosaur. It's a prehistoric mammal. Mammals lived with dinosaurs? Oh yeah. Lots of them. You can tell it's a mammal because it has fur and it didn't lay eggs like dinos. Instead, it gave birth to live babies. See? Gross. [Dana] One. Two. Three. How many of my socks did you use? A lot? These two are my favorite ones. Oh, kind of looks like a mouse. [Dana] You know what else looks like a mouse? A mouse! What? Ooh, she's getting closer to you. - What? - I think she likes you. - Ew, ew, ew. - Who are you texting? Mom will be home soon, so I'm asking her to buy a mouse trap. A mouse trap? No! Run, mouse, run! Sara, we can't use a mouse trap on that poor, little mammal. She could be the great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, times a million granddaughter of the Eomaia. I don't care-a! Dana, we can't have a mouse living in the apartment. It's gross, and it'll leave droppings everywhere. And mom thinks I'm right. What if I get her outside? Please, seester, just give me a chance? [sigh] Fine, you have until Mom gets home with the mouse trap. Deal! Think, Dana, think. How do you catch a mouse? How is that trap going to work. Mice are omnivores which means they eat pretty much anything, so I used cheese, veggies, and meat for bait. Once the mouse takes the bait, the bucket will fall down, trap her, and I'll take her outside. Better hurry up. Mom will be home soon. There's the mouse! Whoa, where? [giggles] Kidding. But you should have seen your face. Very funny, Dana. Hmm... Looking at all this bait is making me kind of hungry. [***] Mouse! Okay, mouse. Calm down. I'm going to get you outside where you belong. Mouse? But if you're over there... who's in here? [squawks] Microraptor? Oh no. [chirps] The microraptor thinks the mouse is a prehistoric mammal. Run, mouse! [chirps] [squawking] How'd he get in here? [chirping] [squawking] [distant squawking and crashing] [sighs] [squawking] [distant crashes] Where'd they go? - Dana, what did you do? - It wasn't me. The microraptor got in through an open window. It's after the mouse. [Mom] Girls, I'm home! Oh, guys, what happened here? You should see the kitchen. Sar! Saving lives is messy. Mom, I've been trying to get the mouse outside and back to its family. Oh, that's sweet, nugget. Now, let mom take care of it. But mom! We can't have mice in the apartment, and clean up this mess, please. Poor mouse. I'll help you tidy up, Dana. You know, it probably has a nice seeester mouse who loves it a lot and is out there looking for it. I have an idea. Once mom's out of the kitchen, I'll stay here cleaning up while you keep trying to save the mouse. - Really? - Traps out. I'll go get changed and then I'll make dinner. Go, now's your chance. - Thanks, seester. - You're welcome, seester. Oh, mice are still so gross. Where are you? Where are you? [squawks] There you are, microraptor. [chirps] [squawks] No, no, no. You don't want that. It's a trap. You'll get hurt. Um... [chirping] [***] [squawk] [squawk] [***] [squawking] That was close. Still no mouse, but I think I just solved my dino experiment on how you catch your food. Maybe I can use that to catch the mouse. Do you want some beef jerky for helping? [chirping] Then go get it! [chirps] [chirping] [crunching] [chirping] Chirp! Bye! Now I get to be the microraptor. [***] [***] [***] [***] Squeak, squeak, squeak. Dana, what are you doing? I solved dino experiment 504, how did the microraptor hunt its food, so now I'm hunting the mouse just like the microraptor would. So, uh, why are you up on the chair? The microraptor would hide up high so it's food wouldn't see it. Then it would use its wings, glide down and catch it. Just... like... this. Ew... [yells] You got it. - Nice work, microraptor. - Thanks. Let's get this mouse back outside. Uh, Sar, do you wanna help? - Uh, yeah, no. - Okay then. So, first thing we got to do is slide that over. Okay, and now we got to get a piece of paper and put it underneath, okay? Nope, nope... * [continuous theme music] * * [music continues] * * [music continues] * [music ends] [***]
