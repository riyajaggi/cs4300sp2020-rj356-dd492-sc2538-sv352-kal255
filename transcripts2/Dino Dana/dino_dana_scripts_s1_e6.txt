 [grunts] Almost done. Hey, Mr. Hendrickson. Mr. Hendrickson! Mr. Hendrickson. Over here. It's Dana! Good morning, Dana. Guess what we are? Working independently? We're samesies. If you say so. [grunts] I do. Doesn't my Pterodaustro

 look like your flamingo? I suppose. And that's not all. Flamingos are birds and Pterodaustro and Pterosaurs. Guess what they both can do, I'll give you a hint. Fly. Which reminds me, I better be flying inside. Aren't you going to ask me why I'm making a Pterodaustro. Not particularly, but I'm sure you're going to tell me. I'm doing dino experiment 518, how does a Dromaeosaurus use its claws? How does a Ptera-what- you-ma-call-it help you in that? Pterodaustro and I thought you'd never ask. The Dromaeosaurus is a carnivore with curved claws and it moved like this... [growls] But I've never seen it in action. So, I'm using the Pterodaustro as bait. Well, that sounds destructive. Bye now. Hey, Mr. Hendrickson, you forgot a flamingo. At least I think it's a flamingo. It certainly used to be. My daughter Gabriel painted this when she was a little girl. Unfortunately, it doesn't match the others so it stays in the box. I didn't know you had a daughter. - You never asked. - Do you have a son? - No. - Do you have another daughter? - No. - Was your daughter like me? - Hm. - Did she like dinosaurs? No, she prefers birds. Well, birds came from dinosaurs. Maybe you daughter and I are samesies too. [laughs] Mr. Hendrickson, can you tell her I love how colorful her paint job is? Will do. [laughs] Bye, now. Bye, Mr. Hendrickson. I'll let you know how my experiment goes. - I can't wait. Well, I'm going to have to wait... For a Dromaeosaurus. [***] [squawks] And there's one now. [coos] It sees my Pterodaustro. [high pitched coo] I think it knows my Pterodaustro's not real. [squawks] Oh, that's how you use your claws, Dromaeosaurus. [high pitched coo] [Mr. Hendrickson] I thought I heard a commotion. What did you do to my flamingo? Wasn't me. - Who did it? - It was the Dromaeosaurus. Where is he? I don't see him. All I see is you. - It ran away. - Ran away? Must have thought your flamingo was a Pterodaustro. The Dromie kicked out it's legs like this, then flipped out it's curved claws like this then ripped your flamingo apart, like this. Squawk! Dino experiment 518 complete. The Dromaeosaurus used its curved claws to attack prey. It was so awesome, but maybe not as awesome for your flamingo. Should I put them away so your Dromoesaurus doesn't uh, destroy anymore? Dromaeosaurus. Don't worry, Mr. Hendrickson. Now that I know how the Dromaeosaurus used its claws, I'll figure out a way to protect your flamingos. [sigh] Now, to figure out a way to protect Mr. Hendrickson's flamingos. [squawks] I think I know. [Mr. Hendrickson] The little girl downstairs. She said a dinosaur ripped my flamingos apart with its claws. Yes, yes, your flamingo is safe. I put it out. Good grief, she's putting all my flamingos in a tree. Listen, I got to go. I'll call you back. I'm always nice. Bye. [sigh] [***] Now the flamingos are safe from the Dromaeosaurus. They're flying just like the Pterodaustro do. [squawks] Hello, Dromaeosaurus. Your claws are great at attacking on the ground but I don't think they're great at attacking in the sky. [hisses] You don't just use your claws to attack prey, you climb trees with them too? Which means the flamingos aren't safe. [squawks] Not the one Mr. Hendrickson's daughter painted! [squawks and roars] [squawks] Ah no, not another one. What did you do now? It wasn't me. - It was the Dromaeosaurus. - Dromaeosaurus. Now you're getting it. And how exactly did it get my flamingo down from up there? Does a Dromaeosaurus fly? No, it used it's claws to climb the tree. It was amazing and upsetting for your flamingos but don't worry Mr. Hendrickson, I learn from my mistakes. I'll figure out a way to protect your flamingos. I got to go. I wonder why the Dromaeosaurus didn't take the colorful flamingo. Maybe it really likes pink. [squawks] Hmm, that Sinornithosaurus looks the same as that colorful flamingo. Oh no. Watch out, Sinornithosaurus. [both hissing] Why aren't you leaving, Sinornithosaurus? [chirps and squawks] Why didn't the Dromaeosaurus use it's claws on you, Sinornithosaurus? Maybe Mr. Hendrickson can help. No, I didn't call you to tell you that I was right. But I was right. She destroyed another one. [knock on door] Somebody's at the door. No, no, no. Don't come over. [knock on door] You hang up on your father. Mr. Hendrickson, the weirdest thing just happened. Don't tell me. The Dromaeosaurus came back and destroyed another flamingo. No, but close. The Dromaeosaurs ran into the Sinornithosaurus. What's a Psyan nick a nymphasaurus? Sinornithosaurus. This one. It's a small, colorful dino but that's not the weird part either. The weird part is that the Dromaeosaurus didn't use it's claws on the Sinornithosaurus. Instead, it ran away from a way smaller dino. Isn't that weird. Maybe not so weird. Those colors remind me of something. Would you get that book for me, please? And my glasses? I want to show you something. Okay. There it is right there. This is a blue capped Frieda and this is the Hooded Pitohui. Notice anything about them? They both have bright colors. That's right. Can you guess why? Because they're pretty? Well, in a way. They want predators to notice them because they are poisonous. Birds are poisonous? Some are. Are you saying the Sinornithosaurus might be poisonous? Well, did birds come from dinosaurs? You know that they did. I know how to protect your flamingos now. - Thank you, Mr. Hendrickson. - You're welcome. [***] And done. [squawks] Hello, Dromaeosaurus. Your claws are great at attacking on the ground and climbing trees but I don't think they want to attack poisonous dinos. [squawks] Yes, the Sinornithosaurus trick worked. Dino predators know not to mess with poisonous dinos, even if they have awesome curved claws. What happened to my flamingos? I think they look great, Dad. You must be Dana. - You must be his daughter. - I'm Gabrielle. Don't you like the flamingos, Daddy? Yes, I do. [chanting] Hug her. Hug her. Hug her. [laughing] Alright. [Dana] Next up, more Dino Dana! [***] [Dana] Dino Dana! [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] Dino Dana! [roar] [Dana] "The Dino Days Of Summer." [***] [**] [***] [**] [Dad] Stop right there, nugget! [gasp] Where do you think you're going? - To do a dino experiment. - Not in that dress, you're not. Grandma won't be happy if you get that dress dirty. And when Grandma's unhappy, we're all-- [Gloria] Arman! - Yes, Gloria? - Arman! Yes, Gloria? Arman! Yes, Gloria? No need to yell. Where's the camera? On the table. What? On the table! Please, Dad, it's hot out, which means I can finally solve dino experiment 516: How do dinosaurs keep cool when it's hot? Okay, but only if you keep that dress clean. Arman, the camera's not on the table. On the KITCHEN table? Well, your father didn't say that, did he? I've got 50 tables in here. Should I have checked them all? Oh, look at the mess you've made of your shirt. That's a lotta sweat. That can't be healthy. Let's get you inside. Have you been exercising? - [whispered] Stay clean! - C'mon. Now I just have to find a dino for my experiment. [growl] [gasp] [dinosaur bellows] A Footalongasaurus! [***] [**] [***] Footalongasaurus, your name means "giant chief lizard" because you're one of the most giant dinosaurs of all time. You're longer than five school busses, and you weight more than 80 elephants. [***] [**] Hello, Footalongasaurus. [grunting and snorting] [sneeze] Awww! Hot air! Wait... I wonder how something as big as you stays cool. [growl] - You hungry? - [grunt] Oh, you're not eating. You're using the tree's shade to block the sun. I wonder if I can use you for shade... Ah. That's better. [irritated panting from Footalongasaurus] [groan] What's wrong? I guess the tree's not big enough to shade your whole body. [scream] He's coming right for me! [scream] That... was... incredible! Bye, Footalongasaurus. Hope you find more shade. [***] [panting] Mom, you won't believe what I just discovered! [Mom] Dana, you're covered in grass. - What happened? - Footalongasaurus happened. She helped me solve dino experiment 516: How do dinosaurs stay cool when it's hot? Guess how they did it? By covering themselves in grass? No, by finding shade and keeping out of the sun! That's great, honey, but please be careful with this dress. Your grandma took forever to make it. You know how she likes everything to be perfect. - [Gloria] Eva! - Yes, Mom? - We found the camera! - Great! Your husband broke it. I'll be there in a second! Okay, nugget. Have fun finishing your experiment. Just try to... "Stay perfect." Just for a bit longer. Eva! Oh. You're wearing that dress again? Yes? It's just that I thought we agreed on colors... But we don't have to match. I can change it. Oh... Thanks. You know, I would go with the fuchsia. That one flatters your figure. [whispering] Just a bit longer. I have to find dino number two for my experiment. Where's that dirt coming from? [***] [**] Hm. Long quills... You must be the Psittacosaurus! Your name means "parrot lizard" because you had a beak like a parrot! But where's your face? I'll need to get a closer look. [Psittacosaurus cooing] There you are! But where are you going? I need to see how you stay cool! [cooing] Wait... I wonder if that hole you dug helps keep you cool. Only one way to find out! [***] [**] [sigh] It does. The Psittacosaurus made its own shade by digging holes. Oh, someone's in trouble... Grandma's going to be so mad that you got your dress dirty. I'm doing a dino experiment. I just discovered the Psittacosaurus dug holes to stay cool! Why do we have to wear these dresses anyway? It's just what we do. Grandmas make dresses and granddaughters wear them. [Gloria] Sara! Yes, Grandma? How many bows do you want in your hair? None, thanks! [sigh] Quick, help me hide in this hole. Hm. It actually is cooler in here. I know, right? Ahem! Sweetheart, what are you doing? You've got dirt all over the beautiful dress I made you, and it's even in your hair! How many bows do you want to make grandma happy again? Uh... One? On each side? That's a very good idea. You'll look so lovely. Come with me. I can't wait to get started... [Sara] Help, Seester! [Gloria] Maybe even some extra ribbon hanging down... I wonder if there are any other ways dinosaurs stay cool. - [growl] - What was that? [***] Kosmoceratops? Your name means "decorated horn face" because you have the most horns on your face of any dinosaur. [grunting and growling] Are you going swimming to stay cool? I guess not. Ooh, that's a lot of mud! That looks like fun, but I can't get-- ...dirty. Oh, I'm gonna be in so much trouble! ...But I'm less hot. This mud is actually cooling me down. Oh! Some dinos must cover themselves in mud to stay cool and keep the sun off their bodies. Dino experiment 516 solved. Thanks, Kosmoceratops. Not again! [***] Dana, there you are! It's time to fix your hair... ...And your face, and your body. What happened? I solved Dino Experiment 516. Some dinos stay cool on hot days by finding shade, digging holes to make their own shade, or covering themselves in mud. I'm sorry about the dress, Grandma, but dino experiments can be messy. Clearly. That's why I don't really like wearing dresses... Why didn't you just tell me that? Because grandmothers make things and granddaughters wear them. Yes, but I want you to like what I make. I mean, look how happy Sara is! [Sara] So happy. No, I have an idea... Follow me. I'm going to make you something else to wear. It's picture time, everyone! See how saying "Just press the button" isn't helpful when there are a lot of buttons? It's the big one on top. [beep] See? Now that's helpful. C'mon! [laugh] - Say... - I love Grandma! [all laugh] I love Grandma! [snap] * [continuous theme music] * * [music continues] * * [music continues] * [music ends] [***]
