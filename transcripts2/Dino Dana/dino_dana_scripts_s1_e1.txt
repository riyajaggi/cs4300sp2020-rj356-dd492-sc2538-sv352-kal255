 And hey, look. Cool book you should want to look at. A dinosaur. Wow. - And? - It's green? And? And what? - And what's its name? - Troodon. How did you know that? Because it's one of your top 105 favorite dinosaurs. Number 68. Wait, why is this alligator eating its babies? It's not. That's how alligators protect their babies. They put them in their mouth and carry them to safety. Do you want to pull the tab? Come on, "seester", pull it. This one you can push up and down. It's better if you make a sound too. [sighs] Roar... or... I don't think it sounded like that at all. Really? No. See those pictures? Dinosaurs were a lot like birds and reptiles. They had feathers like birds and scales like reptiles and had babies in eggs, just like both of them. So? So, when was the last time you heard a bird or an alligator roar? I think they whistled like birds. Really big birds. Hmm, I never thought of it like that, cool. Do you want to play dinosaur with me? Not right now. Come on. We used to play dino together all the time. Please? You can be whatever dinosaur you want. Except the Troodon. I want that one. Maybe later. Is this the book you want? Yep. I'll wait here. [pop music] - Excuse me. - How can I help you? I'd like to borrow this book, please. Oh, so you like dinosaurs. No. I love them. Especially the Troodon. It looked like this with long tail feathers and really sharp claws. Nice backpack. Uh... Dana. Thanks. My dad made it for me. - Want to see what it can do? - Sure. You can use the zippers and buttons so you can be whatever dinosaur you want. Bet you don't know what this one is. Hmm big frill. - Is it a... - I'll give you a hint. These are horns. There should be three of them, but I only have two hands. That's another hint. Triceratops? - Ding, ding, ding. - I like dinosaurs too. Could you imagine meeting a real-life dinosaur? That's my biggest wish ever. Too bad they aren't around anymore. Sometimes you just need to know how to look for them. Whoa, you've taken out like every single dinosaur book we have here. Yep. That's the last new one. Tell you what. Why don't you try this book? My brother and I call it a dino field guide. A dino field guide? It's filled with dinosaur experiments that need finishing. Ooh I bet you like this one, dino experiment 501, how did the Troodon protect its eggs? How did it do it? Well I don't know. You'll have to figure it out. But the only way to solve it would be to meet a real Troodon. - Wouldn't that be fun? - Can I keep it until tomorrow? Tell you what, Dan-a. Dana. You can keep it for as long as you want. Just promise to pass it off to another paleontologist in training when you're done with it. I will. Troodon promise. You just make a claw with your hand, and then shake. - Thanks... - Trek. My name's Trek. Thanks, Trek. Sar, guess what? I've got a dino experiment. Do you want to do it with me? [odd screeching] What was that? Where's that coming from? [odd screeching] Let me try whistling back. [whistles] I think someone is playing a game with me. [whistles] [whistles] [whistles] [whistles] [coos] [gasps] [coos] I don't believe it. [coos] [coos] [coos] A real-life dinosaur? [loud chirps] Hello, Troodon. You like my backpack? [cooing] You want me to follow you? [coos and squawks] Do you think I'm a Troodon because of my backpack? [squawks] You think I'm a Troodon! [squawks] I'm coming! I'm coming! [squawks] Is this your nest, Troodon? [squawks] I've never seen a dinosaur nest before. And look, you got an egg. Now I'll be able to see how you protect your egg and solve dino experiment 501. Troodon? Troodon? Troo-don? [growls] That doesn't sound like a Troodon. [squawks] An Ozraptor. I can't believe how amazing this is. Your name means Australian thief. Thief. Oh no. You're probably here to steal the Troodon's egg. Think, Dana, think. If I were a Troodon, how would I protect my egg? There's only one thing that can save that egg. Research. [pop music] [Dana] Squawk. Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! [sighs] Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Dana, what are you doing? Solving a dino experiment, obviously. What are you talking about? I remembered Troodons were like birds, so I read how birds protect their eggs. Some birds protect their eggs by staying in large groups like penguins and flamingos. Safety in numbers but because you didn't want to play with me, I was all alone. So, I pretended I was a peacock. They protect their babies by showing off their bright feathers to predators like this. - Squawk! Squawk! - Dana, Dana. This is a library. You need to be quiet. No, you need to help me protect the Troodon's nest. Come and look at it. That Ozraptor might come back soon. Dana, I'll play dinosaurs with you later. You always say that and we never do. Just like we never make our dinosaur crafts together anymore either. [sighs] Just... try to keep it down a bit, okay? But Sara! Shh. Okay. Okay, seester? [whispers] Whisper battle. - Seester. - Seester. - Seester. - Seester. [Sara] You win. Just try to keep it down, Dana. Are you hatching, baby Troodon? I can't believe I'm going to see a real live baby dinosaur hatch from its egg. This is incredible. [loud roar] It's the... it's the... king of the dinosaurs! You sound hungry for eggs, T-Rex. [sniffs] Think, Dana, think. If I were a Troodon, how would I protect my egg from something as big as T-Rex? [squawks] Of course, Dinosaurs are a lot like birds and reptiles. Some reptiles put their babies in their mouth to protect... I'll explain later. [squawks] [roars] * Cause love is like floating on sunshine * * And dancing on rainbows. * * And when I'm with you * * I hope you're feeling it too. * * Ooh. * * Cause love is like open sky * * with my head in the clouds. * * I don't care I don't care if I ever come- * * I don't care I don't care if I ever come- * [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [roars] [squawking] [dramatic music] [roars] [Troodon coos] [roars] Are you starting to hatch, baby Troodon? I can see your claw. That's it. You can do it. Aww. There's your little snout, baby. One more big push. Hello, baby Troodon. It's so cute! [coos] [whistles] [chirps] [coos] [chirps] Sh, baby. It's probably not good to be whistling when there's a hungry T-Rex around. Oh, come on. Please be quiet, baby. [chirping] [chirping] [roars] Shh... [snorts] Hey, T-Rex. I'm sure that Ozraptor would make a better snack than this little baby Troodon. [snorts] You don't agree? Hang on, baby. [roars] [panting] [***] [roars] We got to get you away from that hungry T-Rex, baby Troodon. This will slow her down. [roars] Hurry, baby. [roars] [chirps] [snarls] Sorry, T-Rex. Come on, baby. [***] [Sara] Oh, Dana. [***] [chirping] Come on, baby. Come on! Oh, there you are. How else do you protect your babies, mama Troodon? [coos] The T-Rex has the largest nose of any dinosaur. I don't think it will take her too long to... [roars] [roars] Find us. Dana... Dana? [squawks] What are you squawking at, mama dino? [squawks] A whole herd of dinosaurs? They're beautiful. [roars] Except for when they want to eat a baby dinosaur you just watched hatch. [chirps] Think, Dana, think. Why would the mama Troodon want to get to a giant herd of other dinosaurs? Safety in numbers. If you're not as strong as a T-Rex, hide around other dinosaurs that are. Smart thinking, Mama Troodon. [coos] Dana. Where are you? [roars] How do we get past the king of the dinosaurs? [chirps] We can't get past the T-Rex. [chirps] But we can go through it. [squawks] T-Rex's are big but slow. Troodons are small and fast. Ready to run, baby dino? [chirps] Then let's go. We're coming, T-Rex. [***] Watch out! Go around, baby. [***] [growls] [roars] Hey, T-Rex. Want a Troodon? Then eat this one! [roars] Run, baby! Sorry, T-Rex, that's just a back pack that looks like a Troodon. Better luck on your next hunt. Come on. Your name means king of the dinosaurs, I'm sure you'll catch something soon. [growls] [squawks] Bye, T-Rex. Happy hunting. [chirping] Bye baby! [squawks] [Sara] Dana! Dana! Dana! Dana! Sara! Where did you go? I've been looking all over for you. Where's your shoe and what happened to your backpack? Dad's going to be upset. Sar, you won't believe it. I just got chased by a T-Rex. Well, it wasn't chasing me as much as this baby Troodon that I was protecting. I'm just glad you're safe. Don't run off without telling me next time. Dino promise? Dino promise. Hey, since you already have a dino claw, do you want to play dinosaurs now? Okay, but I get to be the T-Rex. Roar! Or... - Did you drop this? - Yes, and guess what? I solved dino experiment 501, how the Troodon protects its eggs. Good job. How did they? They did it like birds, and reptiles. Troodons made loud noises to scare off smaller dinosaurs and move their eggs to keep them safe from larger ones. Look what the T-Rex did to my backpack. She's got a pretty powerful imagination. The coolest kids do. Yeah, I used to have an imaginary friend unicorn. You still talk to Princess Rainbow Moon Ray. No, I don't. Neigh. Trek, are you almost ready to head home? - Oh, Dan, I want you to meet- - Sara. She's my big sister. And this is her little sister, Dana. Dana's going to be looking after our dino field guide for a while. Dino Dana. I like the sound of that. Maybe I'll see you both around the library sometime. Absolutely. If you're lucky. What? Good luck catching me, sister T-Rex. [giggles] [roars]
