 [**] What're you doing? Putting on lip gloss. - Why? - Meh. Because. It's makeover time! - Hi, Robin! - Hi, Sara. Hi, you. Hi... What's a makeover? It's like dress-up, for your face. When I grow up I wanna be a makeup artist and do make up for special effects and creatures. Wait-- I don't wanna look like a werewolf. You won't! But Sara, I thought we were gonna do a Dino Experiment today.

 Can we do it later? I... guess. Later's a great idea. See ya! Bye! [Robin] Now, are you sure you don't wanna look like a werewolf? [***] What's wrong, nugget? Sara said we'd do a Dino Experiment today, but now she's doing makeovers with Robin. Why don't you invite Riley over? She's at her grandma's. What about the kid with the freckles? Those were chicken pox... But he's still not allowed out. What about your, uh... dino friends? Dad, dinosaurs aren't my friends. They're my research subjects. Dinosaurs don't make friends. - That's sad. - Why? Just sounds lonely. I mean, humans make friends. Why can't dinosaurs have friends? [gurgling sound] [both] Sounds like... ...a Dino Experiment! -Sink's not working. -Thanks, Dad! Uh, you're welcome? Now to see which dinosaur shows up for my experiment. [***] [***] [**] [squawk] [Dana] A dinosaur! But which one? [dino squawking and chirping] [dino squawking and chirping] [dino squawking and chirping] It has a long, feathery tail... It's not big, like turkey sized, and it has big buck teeth. [gasp] It's the Incisivosaurus! And now I get to do Dino Experiment number 517: "Did the Incisivosaurus make friends?" But first... It's Incisivosaurus time! [***] What is she doing? She's becoming a dinosaur. She does it all the time. It's like dress up, for science. [makes squawking noise] Time for Dino Experiment 517: "Did the Incisivosaurus make friends?" But where did it go? [Dana imitates Incisivosaur squawking] [Dana imitates Incisivosaur squawking] [Incisivosaur squawks and chirps] [imitating squawk] [Incisivosaur chirps] It's okay, buddy. I'm an Incisivosaurus too. [squeaking and chirping] [***] I guess dinos don't make friends. [chirping] Is this for me? You DID make friends! [squeaking and squawking] Oh... Lots of friends! What are you doin', nugget? Feeding my Incisivosaurus friends. Some dinosaurs make friends so they can share food. So you're saying your research subjects have become your friends? Dad, this is an important experiment. I'm pretending to be their friend to prove a theory. Ooh! Reggie likes apples. You name them? How else would I tell them apart? Goodbye! Hey friends, look! I brought yummy food for you. [squawking] Whoa! Whoa... [squawking and chirping] [squawking and chirping] Reggie, what was that? [dinosaur growling] Oh no... A Dromaeosaurus! [imitating squawk] Look behind you, Incisivosaurus friends! What do we do? What do we do? I know... Wanna eat Incisivosaurus? [growl, hiss] Well then, eat... this one! [hissing and growling] [hissing and growling] Incisivosaurus friends, run! [Incisivosaurus squawking] Sorry, Dromaeosaurus. I had to protect my friends. [hissing and squawking] [***] Wait up, dino friends! [imitates squawk] [gasping] That was close. [chirping] What's wrong? [chirping] Reggie? Oh... My backpack is destroyed, so I'm not an Incisivosaurus anymore. Wait, does that mean we can't be friends? [squawking] [sigh] [chirping and squawking] [chirping and squawking] -Tadaa! -[shout] Notice anything different about me? Sparkles? Fake eyelashes? What's wrong with you? Nothing. [***] [**] I used my backpack to save my Incisivosaurus friends from a Dromaeosaurus, but it got shredded, and I'm not their friend anymore because I don't look like them. What if you COULD look like them? [***] [imitates squawk] [chirping and squawking] Reggie, I missed you too! Oh, Brian! Get in here! [concerned-sounding squawking] Let's celebrate later. Dromaeosaurus is back. [imitates squawk] Follow me. [hiss] Be careful, everyone! The Dromaeosaurus hunt in packs. Aww, why did I have to say anything? [various squawks and hisses] Think, Dana, think. How will I get my friends out of this one? [squeaking and squawking] Good thinking, Reggie! Smaller dinosaurs can work together to scare off bigger dinosaurs. [imitating squawks] [Dromaeosaurus shrieks] [squawking and hissing] [imitates squawk] We did it! [imitates squawk] You know what else? I solved Dino Experiment 517. The Incisivosaurus make friends so they can find food together, look out for predators, and protect each other. [squeak] Now what are we gonna do? [chirp] You're leaving? [chirping and squeaking] You want me to come with you? [squeak] You guys are the best dino friends I've ever had, but... I gotta stay here. [squawk] Now don't make this harder than it has to be. Go, and don't look back. [chirping] I'll miss you! ...Especially you, Reggie. [giggle] Hey, guess what! Your dino makeover worked! My Incisivosaurus friends took me back, and together we solved Dino Experiment 517! Ooh, can we be your next Dino Experiment? What should we paint our faces as? That'll do it! - They got you too? - Mm-hm. [all laugh] [Dana] Next up, more Dino Dana! [***] [Dana] Dino Dana! [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] Dino Dana! [roar] [Dana] "Dino Baby Talk." [***] [**] [***] Spinosaurus! Wait for me! [***] Where are you rushing to, Spinosaurus? [growl] Is it under here? Oh, your nest! It looks like you've got two eggs... [troodon hissing] And a troodon wants to steal them both! [hiss, roar] Whoa! That was a huge roar, Spinosaurus. What other sounds can you make? [low, gentle croaking sound] I didn't know dinosaurs can sing. Why are you singing at your eggs? It's not like they can hear you... Or can they? I bet Mom can help me figure it out. [***] [yoga teacher] And as you release that breath, imagine your baby growing inside you. Once your baby arrives, you will never hear quiet again, so please take a moment... [inhale] Enjoy that silence... Enjoy the silence... [Dana] Moommmmmm!! Enjoy the silence... Mom! Open your eyes! Guess what-- A Spinosaurus just croaked her song to her eggs. I have so many questions. Why would she do that? Can her babies hear her? How do I learn that song? Babies can hear their mother's voices long before they're born. It's how they know they're loved. Are you saying the Spinosaurus, the biggest fish- eating dinosaur ever, with the big sail on his back and a crocodile-like snout, was singing a song to her babies because they can hear her? Well... Your little brother or sister can hear you right now, so it's entirely possible. [Dana] Really? Now, let's all take a moment and say something special to our babies. - Big sisters too. - [Dana] What should I say? Whatever you want, nugget. [imitating Spinosaurus croak] I'm practicing a Spinosaurus song. Why don't you try it as a human? Oh, okay. Hi, baby sister or brother. I'm your big sister, Dana, and I'm gonna show you a lot of stuff... about dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures! [gasp] Dana, the baby just kicked! Wow, there it is again. Someone's very excited! The baby must be listening to you. Really? Well, it stopped kicking, but I think the baby was trying to say hi. The baby was trying to say hi to me from the inside? From the inside! I wonder if this means the Spinosaurus babies can talk from the inside of their eggs, too. There's only one way to find out. It's Spinosaurus time! Spinosauruuuussss! [relieved sigh] Enjoy the silence... No sign of Mama Spinosaurus. Let's see what happens when big sister Spinosaurus does this... [imitating croak] [croaking from inside egg] I don't believe it! The baby spinos are croaking back from the inside of their eggs! I wonder what they're saying. They're hatching! [eggs cracking] Oh, look at you! [tiny croaking sounds] Hello, little Spinosaurus brother and sister. [croaking] Sounds like you're hungry... Except I'm all out of fish jerky. Luckily, mama isn't! Look at all the yummy fish she brought us to eat! [baby dinos squeak and croak] Aren't you going to feed us? [load croaking] [babies croak] How do you two know the song already? You just hatched! [dinos hissing and croaking] [dinos hissing and croaking] [dinos hissing and croaking] Oh, you want me to croak for my supper too. [imitating croak] [displeased growl] [roar] Ow! Don't do that! Why would you push an adorable Spinosaurus baby outta your nest? I'm telling my mom. [dinosaurs squeak, hiss, and croak] ...And as you lay here, feel the energy of the sun as it shines on you and your baby. Feel the sun on your face... Feeling the sun on my face... [Dana] Mom! Guess what!! Something terrible happened! Great... The Spinosaurus babies learned their mom's song. When I couldn't sing the song, the mom pushed me out of the nest! Babies can learn to recognize music and sounds while they're in their mama's bellies, which is why we're all going to share music with our babies as we sway. Up on your feet, ladies. Don't leave me swaying. * [New Age music] * Some birds teach their eggs a secret song so they know which ones are their babies when they're hatched. Are you saying the Spinosaurus has a secret song? What other secrets do they have? Oh! [laugh] Dana, the baby just kicked again! Lemme feel! - Sorry, it stopped, but... - Aww. ...But the baby definitely likes the sound of your voice. Hi, baby. Talk later. I've gotta go see if my little dino brother and sister have another secret to share. * [New Age music] * Sway with your baby... Sway... [***] Where's your mom, babies? Yeah, I mean... [imitating croak] You still don't understand me? [alarmed croaking from babies] Oh no. Troodon's back. Little Spinosaurus brother and sister, follow me! Oh, no! They won't follow me unless I sing their secret song! I need to remember the song their mom sang. [attempting to recreate mother's croak song] [cheerful croaks] It worked! Let's go. [Dana imitates croaking] [hiss] C'mon, babies! [croak] Come on! [Dana croaking, troodon hissing] [Dana croaking, troodon hissing] [babies croaking] Oh no, babies! Are you okay? [hiss] Oh no! Now what're we gonna do? Wait... I remember what worked to scare you off before, Troodon... Roaaaaarrrrr!! [loud roar] [whimper] Bye, Troodon! Hey, Mama Spinosaurus. Thanks for teaching me your secret song. And if you ever need a dino baby sitter, croak me. Bye, babies! [dinosaurs chirping and croaking] [***] And now that we're done our class, hug your beautiful belly tight and thank the universe for your new baby. - Namaste. - Namaste. [Dana] Mom, guess what!! Spinosaurus does have a secret way of talking to its babies! Oh... [laugh] - Was that the baby kicking? - It is. I guess your little brother or sister loves dinosaurs as much as you do. I have so much to teach you. Let's start with the "A" dinosaurs. Aardonyx-- It was an herbivore that lived during the Jurassic period and walked on two or four legs. B-- Brachiosaurus. It was purple and yellow-- Well, most commonly... * [continuous theme music] * * [music continues] * * [music continues] * [music ends] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
