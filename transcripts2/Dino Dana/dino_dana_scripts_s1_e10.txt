 There you are, Incisivosaurus. Just stay right there and... I was so close. Dana. Guess what? My favorite cartoon from when I was a kid is finally out online. You go to come see. That's where my bologna sandwich went. Dad! Dana. You scared the Incisivosaurus away. That's this dinosaur. I'm trying to get one of its feathers to complete my dino feather collection. Look, I got the Sinornithosaurus,

 Dromaeosaurus, Microraptor, Troodon, Therizinosaurus, Compsognathus but look what's missing? The inside-of-a-saurus? Incisivosaurus. That's quite the collection, nugget. I'm going to go clean my foot off and then we're going to watch cartoons. [squawks] I'll be back. I've been waiting for this cartoon to be released for forever. I used to watch this every Saturday morning. You're going to love this. [***] [Dad laughs] What? You don't find this funny? This is a classic. This is the Fox and the Hare. [***] What's a hare? The bunny is the hare. That's what they used to call it, I think. In the olden days? Just watch the... [***] Ouch. Is the fox okay? He's fine. The fox is always trying to catch the hare. Must be really hungry. Isn't it hilarious? You know what's really hilarious? The Incisivosaurus. A turkey sized, bucktoothed, super fast dino. It's a theropod, just like the T-Rex, Dromaeosaurus and a bunch of other meat eaters. Oh, so you were using my bologna sandwich as bait. Which is not what you're going to do with this one. [laughs] Look, look watch what's going to happen. See the fox dug a pit and put the carrot as bait for the hare. but guess what's going to happen. I don't know But you just gave me a great idea how to get my dino feather. Alright, but hurry. You're going to miss the... [***] [***] He never learns! Dana! [laughs] [Dana] Closer... Closer... Little closer. That's it. Mmm yum, bologna sandwich. What? Why didn't you fall into the pit? [sighs] All you needed to do was stand right here and... [chirps] Ah. I should have known. You're turkey sized. Probably too light to fall inside the pit. I need a new plan. Oh. I'll be back! [chirps] Again. Dad, the pit didn't work. Never works on the hare either and mine. Wish I'd known that before I tried it. Ooh, look what the fox is trying now. [***] [***] A trap that falls from above. Being light won't help the Incisivosaurus get away from that. Spoiler alert. This one's not going to work either. [***] [***] Oh... [***] [chirps] [***] [***] I don't have a net but this box is just as good. [***] [***] Yes! Time to collect my feather. Huh? Where's the Incisivosaurus? You bit through the box with your big buck teeth. I'll be back. Don't even think about it. And what did you do to that Water Slider box? Did you chew through it? I didn't. The Incisivosaurus did with its big buck teeth. So, you didn't get the feather? No. It was too light for the pit. And too chompy for the box. I'm going to need another trap. Dana, hand it over. [***] [laughs] [***] [***] Looks like you're the fox and you're not fast enough to catch the hare. That's it. I've got to make myself as fast as the Incisivosaurus. I don't have any rockets but I do have a... Water slider! [***] [***] [laughs] Jokes on you, I took the stuff to make another sandwich. And I'm out of bologna. [***] [***] [***] [***] [chirps] [***] [***] [***] [***] [***] [chirps] You win. What? You're eating the lettuce? But you're a carnivore, aren't you? I guess not. That means you're an herbivore in a family of carnivores. This is an amazing discovery and you just gave me an idea. Tomato for a feather? Thanks, Incisivosaurus. [squawks] [laughter] Dad, guess what? You found your feather? Yes. Collection complete. Hm. But that's not all I got. Here, Dad. Hmm. It's a bit wet. And there's no lettuce but thank you. You're welcome. * [music from television] * * [music from television] * [Dad laughs] [both laughing] [both laughing] [squawk] [Dana] Next up, more Dino Dana... [***] [Dana] Dino Dana! [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] Dino Dana! [roar] [Dana] "Dino Sight." [***] [Dana] Gotcha, Compsognathus! [squawk] Now I got you! [sigh] Dana... [Dana] I can't see anything! The light... Where'd it go? Where'd what go? The Compsognathus. I'm trying to figure out dino experiment 520: Which dino had the best eyesight for hunting. And it definitely wasn't the Nanuqsaurus. The Nanuq... ...saurus! [Dana] It's one of the coolest dinosaurs of all time. And I mean literally cool. Its name means "polar bear lizard," and it lived up north where it's dark half the year. So it could see really good in the dark-- and it's what I am right now. So that's why you took my night vision goggles. "Borrowed..." And yes, thank you. Mm-hm... [gasp] I hear your dad calling. I didn't hear anything. Oh, I definitely heard-- Oh! There he is again. Really? "Dana!" Yep, that's him calling. Pretty sure that was you. Nooo! C'mon. [squeaking] Here she is. Perfect vision. Great! C'mon, Dana. Time to go home. Uh, Dad...? Over here. Right. [chuckle] I knew that. Sorry, sir... Ma'am? When's the last time you had your eyes checked? Me? Oh, I'm fine. We came to get Dana looked at, right, Nugget? [giggle] Over here. Right. Uh, Dad, I think you're the one who needs glasses. Oh no, I'm fine. I can see perfectly. Hmph. How many fingers? Four... Two... Three! [laugh] Alright, let's get you back in the chair. I'll have you seeing like an eagle. An eagle? Some paleontologists think that the T-Rex could see like an eagle... [growl] ...Which make sense because birds came from dinosaurs. But how good can an eagle see? Well, at eagle can see like... a person looking through binoculars. Can I borrow those? Yes. Dad, can I finish my dino experiment in the park? It's T-Rex time! Okay, you stay where I can see you. Thanks, Dad! Right this way. Oh... Yeah, just follow me. No, no. Here. Yeah. Mm-hm... Forward... No. That's sideways. This way. [***] [**] [***] Binocular view, activate. Dino experiment 520, continue. I know the Nanuqsaurus had night vision but couldn't touch the Compsognathus. Now let's see if the T-Rex has better luck with eagle vision. Ah-ha! With my T-Rex eagle vision, I can spot you, Compy, from far way before you can see me. Ha-ha! Now I just need to catch it. [squawking] If I'm going to catch it, I need to get closer without it seeing me. Just missed me. [panting] [hiss, squawk] No... Now it saw me! [Compy squeaking] I'm gonna get you, Compsognathus, just like a T-Rex would. T-Rex eagle vision is way better than Nanuq night vision, but it doesn't help me with how fast you are. Wait up, Compy! Where are you? There you are! [squawking] [panting] Where'd it go? Oh no! The Compy camouflaged itself in the yellow flowers. Looks like T-Rex vision isn't the best eyesight for hunting after all. Now what? [***] [squawk] Dad! Doctor Webster! You won't believe it. I almost caught the Compsognathus using T-Rex eagle vision. Hold that thought, nugget... Whoa, that's what you look like? Dad! I was so close to catching the Compsognathus but it used camouflage to get away by hiding in some plants that are the same color as it. T-Rex eagle vision doesn't help you see through camouflage. Ooh! I like your glasses. They're snake pattern. Y'know, Dana, some snakes have great vision. Too bad there's no snake dinos. There are. The Titanoboa. The Titana-who-a? This is the Titanoboa. Biggest snake of all time. But how do snakes see? Well, some snakes have infrared vision... I'm a kid. Some snakes see the heat that comes off of a body... I wonder what that looks like. Well, why don't you see for yourself... with these heat vision goggles? [Dana] Wow, this is what heat vision looks like? You two look so weird. Kinda like rainbow-ey alien blobs. But why would snakes wanna see like this? Well, because, um... Even if I try to hide behind some plants... [Dana] I can still see you! Heat vision is amazing! Camouflage won't work on Titanoboa vision. Can you imagine? The largest snake ever discovered also had the most awesome eyesight. I gotta get back to the park to see if the Titanoboa had the best eyesight for hunting. And I need to take... ...BORROW your goggles. Go ahead. Thank you! It's Titanoboa time! Ooh. Look at these ones. Oh... I look like a model, basically. [***] [**] [***] [**] Heat vision, activate. Dino experiment 520 continues. I know the Compsognathus was too fast for the Nanuqsaurus's night vision and too sneaky for the T-Rex's eagle eye vision, but maybe the Titanoboa's heat vision will be the best eyesight for hunting. Weeeee! I just need to find the Compy so I can hunt it. [squeaking] That sounded like the Compsognathus! [squeak] There you are. Whoa, you're really letting off a lot of heat. I'm gonna get you, Compsognathus! Wait up, Compy! [squawking and chirping] I'm right behind you! There's no escape. [squawking and chirping] Okay, maybe you CAN escape... [***] Ah-ha! I see you! Trying to camouflage again, huh, Compy? [panting] Not so fast. You ran from the Nanuqsaurus night vision, hid from the T-Rex eagle vision, but there's no escaping from Titanoboa heat vision. [squawk] Gotcha! Yes! I did it! Nom nom nom! I'm not gonna eat you, silly. Thanks for all your help, Compsognathus. [hissing and squawking] [dinos growl] Dino Experiment 520 is solved. Even though the Nanuqsaurus had great night vision and the T-Rex had Eagle binocular vision, it wasn't a dino that had the best eyesight for hunting after all. It was the Titanoboa, a prehistoric snake with super-hot heat vision. [squawking] You wanna play again? Alright. But this time, you're the hunter. * [continuous theme music] * * [music continues] * * [music continues] * [music ends] [***] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
