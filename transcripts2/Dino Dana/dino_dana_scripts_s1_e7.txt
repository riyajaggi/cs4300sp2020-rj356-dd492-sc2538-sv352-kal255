 Dino Dana!
 "Calling All Plesiosaurs."
 [blowing bubbles]
 [blowing bubbles]
 [gasps]
 Dana!
 Riley, I thought we were going to play in the pool
 after you called your mom.
 Yean, I don't feel like it now.
 Hmm...
 Dana!
 What happened on the phone?
 Nothing, it doesn't matter.
 Okay, okay.
 She said she's still working
 and won't be back home for a few more days.
 You miss her?
 A lot.
 You know what I do when I'm sad?
 - Dino experiment? - Exactly.
 Don't you do those when you're happy too?
 Yes and bored or excited or nervous.
 Really, any feeling.
 Do you want to do one with me?
 It might cheer you up.
 Okay.
 Except we can't do the dino experiment.
 Oh, why?
 Because we're doing
 a prehistoric marine reptile experiment.
 What's the difference?
 Prehistoric marine reptiles
 are creatures that lived at the same time as dinosaurs
 but instead of living on land...
 - They lived in the water? - Right.
 Today, we're going to try to figure out
 what they would have sounded like underwater.
 But to figure that out,
 wouldn't we need to go back to when dinosaurs lived
 in some sort of a time traveling submarine?
 Yes. Yes, we would.
 [both gasp]
 [blowing bubbles]
 [sonar ping]
 Roar!
 I don't hear anything, captain Dana.
 Me neither, Admiral Riley.
 Maybe we should try different sounds.
 Good idea.
 [both making various animal sounds]
 [sonar pings]
 [both making various animal sounds]
 Nothing's working.
 Maybe underwater prehistoric marine reptiles
 didn't make any sounds?
 [distant squealing]
 Did you hear that?
 There it is again.
 It's coming from this way.
 [***]
 It's getting closer.
 [distant squealing]
 [distant squealing]
 And closer.
 [distant squealing]
 And close...
 It's inside the sub. In that torpedo tube.
 Open it.
 You open it. You're the Admiral.
 [distant squealing]
 [metallic scraping]
 [squawking]
 Aww.
 [squeals]
 What is it?
 A baby plesiosaur.
 [both] Aw...
 But what is it?
 This is it.
 Plesiosaurs are prehistoric marine reptiles
 with super long necks and four flippers.
 But, if we found its baby then where's it's mom?
 Maybe she lost it.
 Aw.
 It's probably sad and missing her.
 We have to get that baby back to its mom, captain.
 Aye, Aye, Admiral.
 [both gasp]
 Don't worry, baby. I know you're sad.
 We'll get you back to your mom, I promise.
 [mechanical clunking]
 [squeals]
 That doesn't sound good.
 Let's get back to the control room
 and see what it is.
 And it's my turn to hold the baby.
 [squawks]
 [sonar pings]
 Uh oh.
 What's uh oh?
 Take a look.
 [***]
 Uh oh.
 What is it?
 A Deinosuchus.
 What's a Deinosuchus?
 This is a Deinosuchus.
 - A crocodile? - A crocodile?
 More like the biggest crocodile that ever lived.
 That's not good.
 No, it's not.
 The Deinosuchus is a carnivore
 that eats small sea creatures.
 Small sea creatures like baby plesiosaurs?
 [both gasp]
 [roars]
 [alarm bells]
 Dive! Dive! Dive!
 [alarm bells and squawking]
 Ah!
 [roars]
 It's still too fast.
 Uh, rise! Rise! Rise!
 Rise, rise, rising!
 [gentle squeaking]
 I don't hear anymore snapping.
 We lost the Deinosuchus.
 [distant roar]
 But we found something else.
 [roars]
 Crocodile snout?
 It looks like another Deinosuchus
 but why is this one a different color?
 I don't think it's a Deinosuchus.
 [roars]
 That's a Spinosaurus.
 What's a Spinosaurus?
 This is a Spinosaurus.
 Another prehistoric marine reptile?
 I can see why you would think that
 but it's a dinosaur that can swim underwater.
 Did he eat baby plesiosaurs too?
 It ate anything it could get its crocodile snout
 and long claws on.
 Like our sub?
 [gasps]
 [roars]
 We need to shake off that dino.
 I'm trying.
 [roars]
 Now the Deinosuchus has us too.
 It's okay, baby.
 I don't know how
 we're gonna get you out of this, it's okay.
 My mom would know how to get us out of this.
 - I wish I could call her. - That's it.
 - We should call my mom? - No.
 We should call the baby's mom.
 Plesiosaurs are as long as a bus
 and may have traveled in groups.
 They can scare off the Spinosaurus and the Deinosuchus.
 Baby, we need you to call your mom
 as loud as you can.
 [squealing]
 [squealing]
 It's not working.
 [loud coo]
 Wait, listen.
 Baby, is that your mom?
 [squeals]
 [***]
 [***]
 We did it!
 Now to get you back to your mom.
 [squawks]
 [squawks]
 Off you go, baby.
 [squawks]
 [squawks]
 Ready?
 Aim.
 Baby!
 [loud coo]
 [squeals]
 [both grunt and squeak]
 This makes me wish my mom was here.
 Your wish is my command.
 Mom? But I thought you-
 After your call, I decided to come home early.
 What are you two up to?
 Prehistoric marine reptile experiment.
 On a time traveling submarine.
 Do you want to join us on a mission?
 Can I be Admiral?
 You can be the commander.
 Can I play too?
 You're the Deinosuchus.
 [both gasp]
 [all blowing bubbles]

 Dino Dana!
 "King Of The Dance Floor"
 Brachiosaurus, Sauropod group.
 Triceratops, Ceratopsian group.
 Woo, one of my favorites,
 Tyrannosaurus Rex,
 Therapod group.
 [roars]
 Wait up, T-Rex.
 [coos]
 Good morning, Roland.
 Ethyl?
 Oh...
 Hey, Mr. Hendrickson.
 Mr. Hendrickson, you won't believe
 what I just saw.
 Tyrannosaurus Rex, but I don't know where it went.
 Are those binoculars? Can I borrow them?
 Uh...
 Whoa, I can see right into Ms. Curry's house.
 No, you can't. Can you?
 What are you doing
 with all this stuff, anyway?
 Well, I was bird watching.
 Alone.
 - Do you like looking at birds? - Yes.
 I like looking at dinosaurs.
 That's great, for you.
 Hey, Mr. Hendrickson. We're samesies.
 Dinosaurs came from birds
 so we both like looking at the same thing.
 - I'm not sure they're the same. - Oh no, they are.
 Think about it. Do birds lay eggs?
 Yes, of course they do.
 Guess who else did?
 I'll help you. Dinosaurs.
 Birds have feathers.
 Guess who else did?
 It's the same answer as before.
 Dinosaurs?
 Yes, birds had wings for flying.
 Guess who else did.
 Dinosaurs.
 Ehn! Trick question.
 Dinosaurs didn't have wings that flew.
 Prehistoric winged reptiles did.
 Don't feel bad about getting it wrong.
 A lot of people do.
 Hey, can I dino watch with you
 in case a T-Rex shows up again?
 Well, it's kind of a solo sport.
 Hey, Ms. Curry.
 I like your hat and boots.
 Oh, thanks.
 Guess what?
 Mr. Hendrickson is letting me bird watch with him.
 Wow, that's very kind of you, Roland.
 Oh, it's nothing.
 Helping the youth and improving minds,
 ETC, ETC.
 Well, if you're going to insist on joining me,
 then you're going to need your own proper chair.
 Thanks, Mr. Hendrickson.
 I'll stay on the look out while you're gone.
 Oh, and can you bring me back
 some water or juice if you have it?
 Anything but grapefruit or cranberry.
 Those are gross.
 Okay.
 Thanks, Mr. Hendrickson.
 Now all I have to do is wait for...
 what?
 That was strange.
 What's doing that?
 [roars]
 The T-Rex is back.
 [snorts]
 What do you smell, T-Rex?
 Another dinosaur? Maybe something to eat?
 [roars]
 Another T-Rex?
 I wonder if they're going to fight.
 [roars]
 [chomps]
 [roars]
 I'd run away if I were you, littler T-Rex.
 That other T-Rex is a lot bigger than you.
 [roars]
 [grunting]
 What's it doing?
 [roars]
 [***]
 [roars]
 [groans]
 That was weird.
 Mr. Hendrickson, you won't believe what I just saw.
 Don't tell me you just a saw Kirkland's Warbler.
 Um, no. I just saw two T-Rex's.
 Really?
 Yeah, and one was way bigger than the other.
 - She must have been female. - What?
 You did tell me that dinosaurs are a lot like birds, right?
 - Yep. - Well, most bird species
 the females is larger than the male.
 So, it was a boy and girl T-Rex?
 But that doesn't explain
 why the boy was moving so strangely.
 What do you mean?
 The smaller boy dino
 was kind of dancing around the bigger girl one like this.
 [laughs]
 What's so funny?
 Well, sometimes the male bird
 will do a little dance to impress the female bird.
 -Really? -Yeah, let me see.
 This uh...
 Ah.
 That's a bird of Paradise.
 See how the male is dancing around the female?
 He wants to show her that he's the strongest.
 Cool.
 I've got some more information
 on birds of paradise in my apartment.
 I'll be right back.
 [roars]
 Looks like you could use a dance teacher.
 [***]
 [roars]
 [snorts]
 Hey, T-Rex.
 We need to teach you some dance moves
 so you can impress that girl T-Rex.
 Just follow me.
 * [dance music] *
 Come on, T-Rex. Don't you want her to like you?
 [roars]
 * [dance music] *
 Nice moves, T-Rex.
 * [dance music] *
 [roars]
 Look who's here.
 [roars]
 Another male T-Rex?
 We need to step it up T-Rex.
 * Remember the darkest day. *
 * Always goes away, oh yeah. *
 We need a big finish.
 * The sun shining sun will shine again *
 * and I will be with you until the end. *
 [roars]
 Oh no.
 That other male T-Rex is a better impresser.
 Sorry, T-Rex.
 I'll think of something.
 [Mr. Hendrickson] Dana?
 I'm sorry, this is all I could get
 on the Bird of Paradise on such short notice.
 Mr. Hendrickson, it's too late.
 He already lost to a better dancing T-Rex.
 That's no excuse to give up.
 Now see these birds here?
 They're not always successful
 but they keep trying.
 Like this one.
 It's called the superb bird of paradise.
 See how he's hopping?
 Showing others how strong he is.
 Yeah.
 [laughs]
 Whoa, cool moves, Roland. I didn't know you could dance.
 I can't, really, I'm just hopping.
 Well, you're very agile.
 You know, I was wondering if I could interest you
 in a little walk.
 Well, I unfortunately-
 It's okay, Mr. Hendrickson.
 I think you've given me my answer.
 - Thank you. - There you go, come on.
 I, I really should help.
 [growls]
 Hey, T-Rex.
 It's time to jump around
 * [upbeat hip hop] *

 You want dance lessons now too?
