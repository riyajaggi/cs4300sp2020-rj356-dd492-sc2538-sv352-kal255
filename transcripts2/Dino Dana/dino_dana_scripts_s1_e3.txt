 [***] [**] Best way to wake up ever! Good morning, Kentrosaurus! Are you looking for some... Dana, close the window. It's freezing. But Sara, there's a Kentrosaurus outside our window! I don't care-asaurus. It's the weekend. Go back to bed! [lapping up water] [growl]

 [Dana] A stegosaurus too? I don't believe it! Dana, go back to-- What... What are you doing? Pinching myself to make sure I'm not still asleep. [sigh] Sara, I'm going to tell you something even though it might blow your mind. - Are you ready? - Why can't I go back to sleep? You know how my mom met your dad, and now we're a family, even though we look different? Yes, I was there. Well, dinosaurs have the same thing. Some dinosaurs look a little bit different, like how many spikes they have, but belong to the same family. Wow... Mind blown. Well, try this then. Right now... right out there, there's a kentrosaurus AND a stegosaurus! They're both from the Stegosauridae Family. Dana, you should go investigate. - Do you wanna come? - No. Okay, I'll report back later. [sigh] Hey, Dad! Looks like someone's excited for Crafter Day! Can't craft now, Dad. Dino investigation. Okay, I'll start setting... ...up. A Stegosauridae family reunion?! Kentrosaurus meet stegosaurus. Stegosaurus, meet Kentrosaurus. [growl] Whoa! That's quite the hello. [dinos growling] That doesn't sound the happiest... Whoa! Yep, definitely more a "go away." This is not... how family... should treat each other! [dinos growling] Oh no! Look what you did to Sara's pool! Now you've done it. [***] Dad, you won't believe what just happened. Hm... You became a human mop, even though you know tomorrow is Cleaning Fun Day? No, but good idea. I just saw two dinos from the same family fighting, and now I get to solve Dino Experiment 515: "Why would two dinos from the same family fight?" [Sara] Dana, where's my robe?! Surprise, surprise... Dana, give me my robe. I'm not sure you're gonna want it back right now... [Sara] Yes, I do. And what did Mom and Dad say about taking my stuff? [mouthing "Ask first."] Ask first? Give it. [***] - Ugh! It's soaking wet! - That wasn't my fault. That was the dinosaurs. I'm sure they're sorry. Y'know, maybe you'll stop taking stuff without asking if it happens to you. - What does she mean? - [Sara] You'll see! She'll calm down... [door slam] ...in a bit. Let's get ready to craft! [growling] [Dana] The kentrosaurus is back! Dad, I need to go. Finish your Dino Experiment... [sigh] Have fun! Maybe don't take Sara's coat. Too soon? [***] [**] Hey, Kentrosaurus. Are you thirsty? [Kentrosaurus groaning and snuffling] Here you go... Now to solve Dino Experiment 515 and see why you would fight with someone in your own family. Sara and I only fight when she doesn't understand that sometimes I need to borrow her stuff without asking to finish important dinosaur research, like what do dinosaurs in the same family have to fight about? There's only one way to find out. But because stegosaurus isn't around, looks like you're gonna have to fight me, Kentrosaurus. [surprised grunt] [Dana] That's right-- Stegosaurus time! Dad... Where's my backpack? Oh, you mean... this? You look... amazing! But I need my backpack so I can become a stegosaurus and fight the kentrosaurus. Oh, sorry. I need it for my own experiment. Sister Experiment One Billion: "When will my little sister learn to not take her older sister's stuff without asking?" Clever girl... It's probably going to take a long time to solve. You may have my backpack, and all my stuff, but you will never have... Crafter Day. Dad, how fast can you build a stegosaurus costume? - How many spikes does it have? - Twenty-four. Four and a half minutes. Let's get crafting! [growl] Roarrrrrr! I'm a stegosaurus! Time to solve Dino Experiment 515 and see why you were fighting with another dinosaur in your own family. Roarrrr! I'm the stegosaurus! [growl] Come and get this stegosaurus, Kentrosaurus! [Kentrosaurus growling] I think you've won. [stegosaurus growling] Or maybe not. Yes! The real stegosaurus is back. [dinos growling] [dinos growling] Wait... Are you two fighting over the bucket? You are! You're fighting over who gets to drink the water. I knew some dinosaurs competed for food and water. I guess I just thought dinosaurs from the same family would share. Whoa! [dinos growling] But how do I get you two to stop fighting now? Think, Dana, think... [dinos growling] Okay, you two... Cool off! [dinos groaning] Now open up... There you go. Be patient, Kentro. You'll get your turn. Dino experiment 515 is solved. Even dinosaurs from the same family, like the Kentrosaurus and the stegosaurus, would compete for food and water. And now that you've both got what you want, you don't need to fight any more! Isn't it better-- and less painful-- to be friends? [dinos grunting and groaning] [dinos grunting and groaning] It's crafting time! [***] I'm still doing my experiment. I already finished mine, but I thought of something else-- Something I wanted to give you. Did you make this... for me? - Yeah. - Dana! Wait-- All these pictures are of you wearing my stuff. [Dana] Exactly. I'm going to call it the "Seester Ask Me" box. If I ever need to borrow something and you're not around, I'll write it down and put it in this box so you know that I knew I should ask and didn't just take it. Do you like it? I love it! Thank you, seester. Oh, there's already one in here. You don't have to read it right now. "Can I borrow your inflatable pool forever?" Forever? What happened to my pool? Dana! [Dana] Next up, more Dino Dana. [***] [Dana] Dino Dana! [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] Dino Dana! [roar] [Dana] "Snakes and Dinosaurs." [***] [***] [***] I've never seen a pink tail before. I wonder which dinosaur it belongs to. Only one way to find out! Gotcha! Oh, you're quick... but I'm quicker. Ah-ha! [exhausted gasp] [exhausted gasp] How long is your tail? [***] That's not a tail at all... and you're not a dinosaur. [hissing] You're a prehistoric snake! From the looks of it, you're the biggest one of all time! You... must... be... the... [gasp] ...Tyrannosaurus Rex! [roar] [hiss] You're not going after the king of the dinos, are you? Please hiss "Yes!" Please hiss "Yes!" [roar] [Mom] Dana, come back now, please. It's time to go home. Sssssorry, prehistoric snake. Gotta go. Mother calls. [T-rex groans] Mom, you won't believe what I just saw at the park! Somebody, anybody! Help me! Emergency! Emergency! Emergency! Hold that thought, nugget. How can I help you, sir? When she asked me to pet-sit, I assumed she had a dog, or a cat, or a gerbil. - What? Who? - Lisa... That's my girlfriend. Well, we're dating. I think she's my girlfriend. Is three weeks long enough to say girlfriend? Sir, is there...? Well, I didn't think she'd have a pet... THIS. A snake? Mom, that's what I saw at the park-- except a way bigger version. Bigger than this? That sounds terrifying. Terrifyingly awesome! The snake I saw was the biggest one of all time. It's as long as from... here... to all the way over here. - What is happening? - Guess what its name was. I'll give you a hint. It has "boa" in it. Give up? It's Titanoboa. Doesn't that sound cool? - Its name means "titanic boa." - Let's not overwhelm... Stuart, and I think we're a bit too late for that. Can I sit down and get some water? I think I'm gonna pass out. - Of course. Come sit over here. - Okay. She's gonna dump me. She's going to dump me. She's totally going to dump me! Stuart, she's not going to break up with you. - What happened? - I broke her snake in half. [both] What?! Look for yourself. [***] Whoa... What is this? The end of my relationship, that's what that is. Actually, Stuart, it's nothing to worry about. [gag] I'm going to be sick. It's just snake skin. Snakes shed their skin a few times a year to help them grow and stay healthy. It's a natural process. Shedding your entire body is normal? [chuckle] Stuart, would you like me to show you how to handle her properly? I bet Lisa would like it if you two became friends. Really? Mom, aren't all snakes poisonous? - [yelp] - Dana, you're right. We should always be careful around snakes. But this snake isn't poisonous. - It's a boa constrictor. - How can you tell? - Yeah, how do you know? - I'll show you. First, let's put you back in your crate. Poisonous snakes get their prey by biting them with their fangs, these very pointy teeth in the front. Take a look, Dana. Whoa. Super pointy. But constrictors don't have poison... or fangs. See? No pointy front teeth. [Dana] No fangs, no poison. Instead they grab their prey, and wrap around, and squeeze like this! [Dana] [laugh] Mom! Killer hugs? Snakes are horrible. No, snakes are incredible. Snakes have been around for over one hundred million years. That's way longer than people've been around. And I just got an idea for a new dino experiment! Dino Experiment 511: "Was the Titanoboa poisonous or a constrictor?" - I need to go back to the park. - Excuse me! Mom, can I go back to the park to finish an important scientific experiment? Well, when you put it that way. It's Titanoboa time. The first step in snake handling is actually touching the snake. With... with my hands? [whimper] [***] Time to see if you have poisonous fangs or not. Hiss! [shout] Hey there. Just slithering by and wanted to say "Hiss!" Now open your mouth and say "Titanoboaaaa..." Oh! Ugh. My mouth was open. Wait, Titanoboa! Come back! I still need to see if you have fangs to help me solve my dino experiment! What is this? Just the Titanoboa's old skin. That's not going to help me solve my dino experiment. [***] It feels... smooth! I was expecting cold and slimy. Snakes aren't exactly what you thought they are, huh? Mom! Dana, we were just getting Stuart comfortable. Well, don't-- I found the Titanoboa in the park, but before I could see if it had fangs or not, it licked me right across my face. Get your face away from that thing. Okay, let's relax. Snakes use their tongue to smell. - They do? - [Mom] Yes! It's how they find their food so the ti- ti- ti... Titanoboa. ...the Titanoboa was probably just smelling you the same way Lisa's snake is trying to smell Stuart. You mean the Titanoboa might be looking for its prey? Maybe. And if she finds it, I'll be able to see if she's poisonous or a constrictor? I guess so. - Can I... - Have fun. - Oh man. Is she hunting me? - No, it's fine. - Is she hunting me? - No, she's just saying-- - It's the look of death! - Just smelling. - It's the look of death! - She's just smelling. - No, it isn't. - Stuart, relax. [Dana] Titanoboaaaa! Where are you? [roar] Sorry, T-rex. I'm looking for history's biggest snake, not history's most famous dinosaur. [growl] Unless the king of the dinosaurs was prey for the Titanoboa. Hey, T-Rex! Wait up. [sniffing] Looks like you smell the old-fashioned way-- with your nose. [hissing] The Titanoboa! Now's my chance to see if you were poisonous or a constrictor. Hey, T-Rex! [groan] Want some beef jerky? [dino noises] [hiss] [roar] The Titanoboa has no pointy fangs, which means it must be a... constrictor. But you seem a little bit small to take down the T-Rex. Oh no. Did I lead the T-Rex to you? Think, Dana, think. How can you save the Titanoboa? [***] [**] [***] Hey, T-Rex! Over here! Want some yummy Titanoboa? It's working! [growling and roaring] [growling and roaring] Thanks for helping me solve dino experiment 511, Titanoboa. You definitely were a constrictor. [hiss] Weeeee! Bye, T-Rex! [***] Mom, guess what? Whoa. Stuart, you're holding the snake! Uh huh. Take the picture... Take the picture. Say "Titanoboa!" [others] Titanoboa! [beep] Aw, I think Lisa will love this. Aw, thanks. Your mom's the best. [chuckle] - Bye. - [chuckle] - Hey, Mom... - Yeah, hun? - You really are the best. - Aw, thanks, nugget. Do you think maybe WE can get a pet snake? - Absolutely not. - But mom! C'mon, mom! - Nope! No way! - They're so cute... * [continuous theme music] * * [music continues] * * [music continues] * [music ends] [***] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
