 [**] [***] There you are-- The spikiest of all dinosaurs... The Kentrosaurus. Now's my chance to solve Dino Experiment 508 and see how you use your boney spikes for defense. I'm an Albertosaurus! Roar! And I'm gonna eat you if you don't defend yourself! Roar! Whoa! Powerful tail spikes. Those aren't the only spikes you have. Roaaaarrrrr! [Kentrosaurus growling] You've also got super- strong side spikes.

 But how do you use your back spikes? [snorting and growling] Think, Dana, think. You're not as big as a real Albertosaurus... I'm gonna have to get bigger. Hm... Hey, Kentrosaurus, watch out for THIS Albertosaurus. Roar! Whoa! You spiked it. [growl] Dino Experiment 508 is complete. The Kentrosaurus swings its bony tail spikes to protect its tail, it swings its side spikes to protect its spikes, it swings its back spikes to protect its back from predators that are trying to eat it, like the... [loud hissing and growling] ...Albertosaurus. Uh oh-- a REAL Albertosaurus. [dinos hiss and growl] Kentrosaurus, your bony side spike! How're you gonna protect your side without your spike? You lost one of your defenses. [Kentrosaurus groans] It looks like the Albertosaurus knows it. [sigh] If you can't beat them, run from them. Smart thinking, Kentrosaurus! I gotta tell... - Sara! - [shout] Are you okay?! [gasping in pain] Ow... Dana, I think it's broken. We need Dad. Ow... Ow... Are you even gonna help me up? Oh. Yeah... Yeah. Ow... Ow... Ow... Ow... Ow... Ow. So... What happened again? [sisters talk over each other with conflicting stories] [sisters talk over each other with conflicting stories] ...and she bashed into me and broke my arm! Because she was sneaking up on me to try and scare me! Okay, that part's true, and I would've... Ow. Except she fell back down on her arm. So it was an accident and wasn't anybody's fault? - Uh... - My arm! [both sigh] No. And...? [both] Sorry. "Sorry" who? [both] Sorry, seester. That's my girls! Now that's sorted, let's get an x-ray, make sure we're actually dealing with a broken arm. Actually, I already know it's broken from how much it hurts, which is ACTUALLY a lot. Ohhhh... like how much it "actually" hurt when you thought you broke your leg? What's your point, Dad? Remember how that turned out to be just a leg cramp? Or it could've just healed really quickly! [sarcastic laugh] X-ray. Let's go. You coming, Dana? I have a dino patient in the park that I need to check on. You do that, nugget. Sara, let's go. [Sara sighs] - Dad, can I get a cookie? - [Dad] Sure. [Kentrosaurus growling outside] [***] Kentrosaurus! Sorry about your side spike. Kentrosaurus! Where are you? [nearby growl] Huh. Sounds like a Kentrosaurus. [hiss] But who's making THAT noise? [hissing and growling] Oh no! The Kentrosaurus is being attacked by two Dromaeosaurus... And one of its sides is defenseless. This is all my fault. I shouldn't have distracted the Kentrosaurus from the Albertosaurus. Think, Dana, think! How would you fight off two Dromaeosaurus? [dinosaurs growling and hissing] [dinosaurs growling and hissing] With two Kentrosaurus. [Dana roaring and shouting] Ah-ha! Thirty-six spikes are better than eighteen. [frightened hissing] Nice job, Kentrosaurus. Tail spike high five! Whoa! Gentle. And you'll have to be careful around predators until your spike grows back. Doctor Dana's orders! And I wonder how long that'll take. Please don't touch it. Dad, you're touching it. You're tou-- Ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! I just asked you not to touch it. Sara, while we're waiting for the x-rays to come back, I wanna see how much you can move your arm. I can do this. Hey, Dad. Hey, Sara. Hey, Dana. - How's your arm? - Terrible. I think I have to get it amputated. You're not getting it amputated! What's "amputated?" It's what's gonna happen to me. It's when a person needs to have an arm or a leg removed-- but it's NOT what's happening to Sara. But if you did have to have an arm or leg removed, it just grows back! Arms and legs don't grow back, Dana. Yes, they do! Don't they, Dad? Sorry, no. But the Kentrosaurus lost its boney side spike! It has to grow back, or else he'll be defenseless forever and it's all my fault. Oh, nugget... Nature's cruel. Dad, think. How can you help a dinosaur that's lost its boney side spike? Well, when a human loses an arm or a leg, they get a prosthetic, which is kind of like a fake one... ...like this. So you're saying I need a prosthetic spike to help the Kentrosaurus defend itself again? Uh... okay. And I should use this prosthetic arm for his new prosthetic spike. Uh, that's actually really expensive. Then I should use this cast for his prosthetic spike, because it's hard as bone. That's my demo cast, but... sure, okay. Thanks, Dad! 'Kay, Sara... I'm just seeing if it fits! Your new spike is looking good. Now we just need to test it. Perfect-- a Dromaeosaurus. [hissing] Okay, two Dromaeosaurus... [growling, hissing, and roaring] [growling, hissing, and roaring] ...AND an Albertosaurus! [hissing and growling] Sorry, Kentrosaurus. I hope you pass this test. [growling, hissing, and roaring] [growling, hissing, and roaring] Back off, Dromi! [growl] Home run-- tail swipe! Watch out for the Albertosaurus! [T-Rex loudly snapping jaws] Yes! Your new side spike works! Bye, Kentrosaurus! Just remember to use all your spikes every day to keep the predators away! [Dad] Dana! How's your arm? We got the x-rays back, and surprisingly, Sara's arm isn't broken, or sprained, or even bruised. I wanna second opinion. [chuckle] How's the Kendra... saura... doble.... locious? - Kentrosaurus? - Yeah, that one. It was so cool. I put the new spike on him, and then two Dromaeosaurus came with an Albertosaurus, and they were all like, "Roar! We wanna eat you!" And the Kentrosaurus was all like, "You can't eat me, 'cause I--" - Dana, be careful! - Ow! [groan] I think she broke my foot. We'll get another x-ray. Another x-ray! [Sara whimpers] I think I stepped on your other foot. [Sara] Ow... Ow... [Dana] Next up, more Dino Dana! [***] [Dana] Dino Dana! [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] Dino Dana! [roar] [Dana] "Be my Dino Baby." [***] [**] [Mom] Maybe we can do it again. The first thing I'm gonna do is get your sister, and if you can... [strange snorting sounds from nearby] [Dana making snorting sounds] Dana... What are you doing? I'm a Maiasaura baby, and this is my nest! Why are you using my baby blankee? Paleontologists found Maiasaura bones with tons of eggs. "Mia" even means good mother! What does that have to do with my blankee? I'm trying to prove Dino Experiment 506: "How Was The Maiasaura A Good Mother To Its Babies?" And...? And I'm using your baby blankee softer to sit in. - Can I borrow it, big seester? - Mom, we talked about this. Dana, you know you're supposed to ask BEFORE you take. You guys weren't home, and it was in the spot she keeps her diary! - Did you read my diary? - No... - But who's Dylan? - I'll wash it when she's done. Now, why don't you be a good daughter and help us bring the groceries in. I'll be right up! ...As soon as I finish my experiment. [distant rumbling] What's that sound? Whoa! A whole herd of Maiasaura? [Maiasaurs snorting and growling] [mimicking snorts] They don't see me. Over here! I'm your baby! [mimicking dinos] Look how cute I am! Oh no! They all left! One more chance. Let me try it with my hood on this time. [Maiasaur snorting] [giggle] Awww. She thinks I'm her baby! What? Where are you going? Oh, wait-- To the lettuce? [Maiasaur chews] You're just hungry. Now how am I gonna solve Dino Experiment 506, "How Was The Maiasaura A Good..." Bleccchhh! "...Mom?" Uh... Well... Guess that's your answer. [sigh] The Maiasaura was not a good mom. She spit lettuce all over me. Well, I guess there's no salad tonight. Dana, what'd you do to my blankee? Wasn't me. It was the Maiasaura. Really? Why would a dinosaur spit on her baby? - I spit food on you. - [Dana] What? - In your mouth. - Worse. Sometimes I had to chew your food for you before you had teeth. [sisters] Gross. It isn't gross. It was to help you eat food you couldn't chew yourself. Wait, are you saying the Maiasaura was trying to help me eat? It's possible. The Maiasaura IS a good mom to its babies, because it helped them eat! Dino Experiment 506 is solved. Wait-- If they were good moms, were the Maiasaura good dads, too? I don't know. Its name means "good mom," not "good dad." Lots of animals have good dads. Some are so good they even give birth to the babies, like seahorses. Glad I'm not a seahorse... [mimicking horse] Yayyyy! - [Dana] Dad! - [chuckle] So maybe the Maiasaura was a good dad! Dino Experiment 506 update. I'm gonna need your blankee again. No way. Mom, I asked before I took! She has to give it. Her blankee, her choice. I bet Dylan would let me... Fine! Just take it. [sigh] [parents] Who's Dylan? [***] [**] [Dana] There's another Maiasaura? [roar] Do you two know each other? [Maiasaurs groan and snort] That must be the dad! Yes! Now's my chance to see how he takes care of their babies too. [Dana imitates Maiasaur snorts] [Maiasaurs grunt] Hey, dino dad! Over here! I'm your baby! [sniffing] So far so good... [chewing] Uh oh. Are you gonna spit on me too? Here it comes! Why aren't you spitting on me? [snort, grunt] Hey! Gentle Maiasaura, Dad. [Maiasaur snorting] You pushed me out of the nest! ...And got Sar's blankee super dirty. Sara's going to be so mad. Thanks, Dad. [Maiasaurs groaning and snorting] [Maiasaurs groaning and snorting] [sigh] The Maiasaura was not a good Dad. - What happened? - He pushed me out of the nest. At least my blankee didn't get covered in dino spit. Uh, about that... Dana! Sorry, seester. Dino Experiments are messy. He stepped on it. Worst dino dad ever. Can you believe he pushed me out of the nest? Hold on there! Sometimes kids need a little nudge. Sara, remember when you wouldn't go into the classroom on your first day of school and I had to push you? - No. - Well, ya did. And now you love school-- and apparently someone named Dylan, which we will talk about later. So you're saying the Maiasaura dad was trying to teach me to leave the nest? Why not? So the Maiasaura is a good dad! Dino Experiment 506 update is solved! Boom! Uh, do you need some help with dinner? Uh, yes, please. Just dadding-- y'know, parenting. [Mom chuckles] So the mom is good, and the dad is good... but are they good together? Only one way to find out! Just leave my blankee out of it! [sigh] [***] They don't seem to be working together. [nearby growl] [Maiasaurs growling in alarm] [T-Rex roars] A T-Rex is coming... What're they gonna do? Whatever it is, I hope they do it quick. [dinos growl menacingly at each other] [dinos growl menacingly at each other] Where you going, Dad Maiasaura? [dinos growl] This... is... awesome! The mom is taking on the T-Rex while the dad is protecting me. Oh no! I think the T-Rex sees me. [roar] What? Why am I going up? Whoa... Whoa! You're carrying me away from the danger! Thanks, Maiasaura Dad. [gasp] I think he noticed me. [dinosaurs roaring] [dinosaurs roaring] [dinosaurs roaring] The Maiasaura mom is distracting the T-Rex! [dinosaurs growl and snort] She's too fast for you, T-Rex. [dinosaurs growl] Yes! Go Maiasaura parents! [dinosaurs roaring] [dinosaurs roaring] [dinosaurs roaring] Nice team work, Maiasaura Mom and Dad. You worked together to guard the nest and protect me. [Dad] Dana, dinner time! [sigh] Gotta go, dinos. [Maiasaurs groan and snort] The Maiasaura's a good mom, a good dad, and they work together! But the most incredible thing is that while I was learning all of that, I also washed Sara's blankee! Oh... It's still wet. You're welcome! Who's hungry? Open your mouths... - Ewwww! - [Sara] Gross! [cackle] That's how we're gonna eat from now on. [others laugh] [Dad] New house rule. [***] [**] [roar] * [continuous theme music] * * [music continues] * * [music continues] * [music ends]
