 [**] [***] * [tense music] * [***] * [tense music] * [***] Boo! [yelp] How did you know? You try to scare me every time we come to the aquarium. And one day it'll work. Whoa, look at that one. [Dana] She's huge! I wouldn't want to swim with one of those. [Sara] Me neither.

 [Dana] I wonder what kind of shark it is. That's a sand tiger shark. How do you know its name? The audio guide told me that it can grow bigger than two of me. That's big, but it's not the biggest shark. No, the biggest is the whale shark. It can grow as long as eight of me. [buzzer noise] The biggest shark of all time was the Megalodon. It was also the most scary. The Megalodon? It's a prehistoric shark that lived after the dinosaurs went extinct. So how big was it? Paleontologists don't know for sure 'cause the only bones they can find were its teeth, which were like the size of my hand. [growl] So how will we ever know how big it was? Well... The best way would be to go back in time in a submarine. [chuckle] Wouldn't that be cool? Yes, it would. [***] [**] [sonar scanning] No sign of the Megalodon... yet. Any luck on the sound scanner, Commander Sara? [Sara] Activating sound scanner. Scanning for any noises outside the sub. Nothing on the sound scanner, Captain Dana. Increase speed to "faster." She's gotta be out there, somewhere. Aye aye, Captain. Increasing speed to "faster." [engine charging] Where are you hiding, Megalodon? [***] [**] [***] [beeping] Contact! Our Megalodon hunt was a success. Yes! Now to see how big she is. We're gonna need to get right up beside her. How will that show her size? This submarine is the size of a bus. If we can get the Megalodon right beside us, we can guess her size compared to our sub. Huh. Smart thinking, Captain. Thank you, Commander. [beeping] [Sara gasps] She's almost on us! [Dana] Almost on us? I don't see her, Commander Sara. [Sara] She should be right there. [Dana screams] [***] [**] We're gonna need a bigger sub. Why would we need a bigger submarine? If she's the same size as our sub, that would make her the largest water predator of all time... Of... all... time. Whoa. Yeah, "whoa." Big-time "whoa." The Megalodon isn't like these cute little sharks, seester. These ones are called bamboo sharks because their color kind of looks like bamboo sticks. [Sara] Oh. But Megalodon's name literally means "mega" for "big" and "-odon" for "tooth." "Big tooth?" Big tooth... little sub. Ooh, seems like the Megalodon is hunting us now! The audio guide said big sharks usually capture their food from below so they can surprise them. Think, Dana, think... [gasp] These bamboo sharks are also called "carpet sharks" because they live at the bottom of the ocean, where it's safer because they can see everything above them. That means all we have to do is get our sub lower than the Megalodon so it can't surprise us! Good plan, Captain. [***] * [tense music] * * [tense music] * Dive, dive, dive! Aye aye, Captain. Dive, dive... diving! [***] [**] [rumble] We've been hit by the Megalodon! What's the damage? [alarms blaring, instruments beeping] [Sara] Everything's broken. But at least we're safe inside the sub. [metal creaking and groaning] [both scream] [giggle] Dana! We're not safe inside the sub. Paleontologists think that the Megalodon had the strongest bite force of any animal that ever existed. Bite force? Is that how strong it can bite? Exactly. [both growl] Hm... Do they know how strong its bite force was? They think it was enough to crush a car! [chuckle] But isn't the metal on a submarine a LOT stronger than on a car? Good point. But it's more exciting if it could bite through. [chuckle] I agree. Back to screaming? [both scream] [giggle] [scream] Argh! What do we do, Captain? Our only hope is to outrun the Megalodon. Quick, go to the engine room, fix the engines, and set our speed to "fastest." I'll stay here and try to dodge her. Aye aye, Captain. Commander... Yes, Captain? Good luck. You too. [***] Get ready, Megalodon. [***] [metal groaning] Hurry, Commander! She's too fast for us! [***] I'm almost there! [grunting with effort] [***] [**] [beep] [Dana] Someone wants to play follow the leader, huh? Well that's great, 'cause I like to lead. [in tune to "Jaws" melody] * Dana... * * Dana... * * Dana, Dana... * * Dana, Dana, Dana, Dana, Dana, Dana... * That's not helpful! [alarm blaring, machinery charging up] [alarm blaring, machinery charging up] [Dana] We need more speed, Sara! The Megalodon's almost on us! [***] [**] Hurry, Sara! [grunt] Speed set to "fastest!" [gasp] [***] [**] We did it! Megalodon high-fin. Oh. [chuckle] I'm just glad the Megalodon isn't around anymore. I'm not so sure... Dana, there's nothing-- Megalodon!! Ha-ha. Got you, finally. N-No, you didn't. I was just... pretending to be scared. Yeah, yeah, sure. Whatever. People who pretend to be scared look like this: [mocking whine] I did not look like that. Yes you did. You can't see your own face. [Sara] Who says I can't? [Dana] Next up, more Dino Dana. [***] [Dana] Dino Dana! [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] Dino Dana! [roar] [Dana] "Dino Dodgeball." [***] [**] [Dana] Wait up, Microraptor! I have a dino experiment to perform! [Microraptor squeaking] Dana, where have you been? I've been trying to solve dino experiment 510: How did the Microraptor protect itself from predators? "Microraptor." Which one is that again? It's one of the smallest dinosaurs ever discovered. It was only like this big. Well, we're gonna feel this big if we're late to Coach Powers' after-school gym program. C'mon. [squeaking] [coach] What... is... dodge... ball? A fun game where you try to dodge balls, or you're out. [laugh] "A fun game?" Do you think a fight for survival is fun? It depends. Are dinosaurs involved? What? Just say "no." No? Didn't think so. [exaggerated grunting] This is survival of the fittest, dodgeball style! Okay... Ahem. This ball must be flat. [cough] Two teams will battle it out to see who will be victorious. Only the strongest will win! The weakest? Well, they'll just put everything away after the game. Who's ready?! [students cheer] Alright... Sara, Riley, you'll be team leaders. So choose your teams wisely. Hm... Aravindan. Rainy. Mm... Ila. Curtis. Mm... Tamara. Which leaves Dana for Riley's team. Hoo! Bit of a size difference here. Alright, Sara, your team will be called the Fighting Tigers! And Riley, I'll call your team the... ...Purring Kitties. Alright, everybody, grab a ball and let's see who will survive! Remember, no throwing in the face, though. Hey, seester, why didn't you choose me for your team? I would have, but Coach Powers said "only the strongest win," and you're the smallest kid here, and I... I like to win! [chuckle] I like to win, too... Sorry, just checking to make sure this thing still works. Alright, teams, let's line up and let's do this! [students cheer] Microraptor! Hi, Microraptor. [squawk] What? I can't hear you through the glass. [tapping] [squeak] [growling and hissing] [growling and hissing] An Ozraptor! Now's my chance to finish dino experiment 510: How did the Microraptor protect itself from predators? [snarl, hiss] ...But only if you know there's a predator. Microraptor, look behind you! [squeak] Be-hind you... Big teeth... Chomp chomp, you. [squeaking] [snarling] [Ozraptor growling, Microraptor squeaking] [Ozraptor growling, Microraptor squeaking] [Ozraptor growling, Microraptor squeaking] The Microraptor uses its fast feet to escape from predators. [Ozraptor growling, Microraptor squeaking] [Ozraptor growling, Microraptor squeaking] But you can't run forever, especially from a predator that is larger and has more energy than you. Why are you heading back here, Microraptor? You can't break through the glass. [Ozraptor growling, Microraptor squeaking] Sorry, buddy. I guess bigger isn't always better. [coach] Take your sides, people! [hiss] Rules are simple... I blow the whistle, you run to the center, grab a ball, and try to tag the other team with it. If you're tagged, you're out, sit down. Last team standing wins. Understood? [students] Yeah! Get back, get back, get back... Okay. [***] [whistle] Go, go, go, go! Ooh! Rainy's out! Curtis is out! Riley, you're out! Oh, ouch! [laugh] The Fighting Tigers completely wipe out the Purring Kitties. I guess size does matter. [laugh] C'mon! Yes, it does. Rematch! What are you talking about, Dana? We just got destroyed out there! They're way too big for us. A lot of people think that all dinosaurs were huge, but they weren't. There were some really small ones that figured out ways to survive. How is this helpful? Because size does matter... Especially when you're small. Bigger isn't always better. All the big dinosaurs became extinct. Do you know who survived? The little ones? Exactly. And they did it by being faster and smarter than the big ones, and that's just what we're going to do. We're gonna be... Faster! And...? Smarter! Sorry. I love rousing speeches. Are we doing this or what? Oh, we're doing this... Microraptor style. [roar] C'mon, Microraptors! [whispering] Here's the plan. Microraptors are one of the smallest dinosaurs ever discovered. They're also one of the fastest. They use their fast speed to escape from predators. That means we can use our fast speed to get the dodgeballs before Sara's team. Then what? Then we take them out one by one. Ready? Ready. [team] Go, Microraptors! [coach] Alright, it's the final match between the Fighting Tigers and the... [team] Microraptors! Oh yeah. That seems to suit you better. Don't know what it means, but here we go! Remember the plan. [whistle] Go, go, go! Ooh! Ila, you're out. Great job, Microraptors. Tamara, you're out! That's four to two for the Microraptors. Double hit! Curtis, Rainy, you're out! The game's tied up. Everyone, grab a ball. Let's go, let's go! Let's hustle! There's nowhere to run now. [Microraptor squawking] [Microraptor squawking] [Ozraptor hissing, Microraptors squeaking] [Ozraptor hissing, Microraptors squeaking] [Dana] It's not just about being fast... It's about teamwork! Riley, smaller dinosaurs had to work together to fight off bigger ones! Work together, huh? Let's do this. [***] [**] [***] [**] I don't believe it... The Microraptors win it! Nice teamwork. Great job, Microraptors. We did it! [sigh] Good game, little seester. Good game, big seester. Another rematch? Sure. But this time, I'm gonna be on your team. That move was awesome. I know. And that's what we call sportsmanship. Let's play again!
