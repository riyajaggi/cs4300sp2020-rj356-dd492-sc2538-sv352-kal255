 [**] [***] [**] [boy] Henry, go get the ball! What're you doing? Digging for fossils, and I just found something. Little help, please? Oh, yeah. This thing's a fossil? Yep. It's something that lived in the prehistoric times and turned to stone. Once we get it out of the sand,

 next up is to figure out what creature it belongs to. Henry, what're you doing? We just found a fossil! But we're playing volleyball! Sorry. Boys only. They used to say that to Mary Anning, and I don't wanna play anyways. Who's Mary Anning? She's only one of the greatest fossil finders ever. This is her. She lived in England 200 years ago. She was the first to discover the plesiosaur... This guy. Have you ever discovered a prehistoric marine reptile? No. Exactly. Sounds like you should play with her. I wish I could. I bet she could help me figure out who this fossil belongs to. C'mon, Henry! Good luck with the fossil. [***] [**] It would be nice to have some help with this. 'Kay... [woman] You're doing it all wrong. What you want to do is uncover the specimen fully before removing it from the sand. Otherwise you risk damaging it. You're... You're... You're... Mary Anning. Pleased to make your acquaintance. What's your name? Da... ...na? Well, "Day-Nah," shall we uncover the specimen? Yes! * [music with prominent harpsichord] * * [music with prominent harpsichord] * Jolly good! Now lift it out. Heave ho! [both grunt with effort] Spots and stripes! It's so cool. It feels rather warm to me. No, "cool" is another way to say "sweet." It means "wicked." It's a way to say "wonderful." Definitely wonderful. Now, which prehistoric creature do you think it belongs to? Think, Dana, think... Ponder, Mary, ponder... [giggle] It kind of looks like a sail... Like what's on a Spinosaurus' back. [snarling and hissing] OR it could be a flipper that belongs to a plesiosaur. [bellow] Really? [plesiosaur calling out] That's the reptile you discovered. Well done. First of many. But if it's a flipper, it could also belong to the Archelon. [growling and snorting] [growling and snorting] An enormous prehistoric turtle... Interesting theory. [both] There's only one way to... ...ascertain to whom this fossil belongs. Spinosaurus? Oh, yes please. [Mary whispering] Test Subject Number One discovered... [Dana] A sleeping Spinosaurus? Perfect. [loud snoring] [both gag] [snoring] [Mary] We must be quiet as mice to make sure we don't awaken this beat. [Dana] Definitely. But how are we going to compare this fossil to its sail? I shall lift you up. [gasp] steady! This is a tad bit harder than I expected. [Dana] Okay, and... [grunting with effort] It's not a match. This fossil is too small. You can put me down now. Oops! [growl] Oh, porridge. Ruuuun! [***] [both screaming] [both screaming] Quick, hide! [dinosaur sniffing] [growl] [gasp] What excitement! I know! But we still have to figure out who this fossil belongs to. Hm.... If it's not a sail... it must be a flipper! Maybe it belongs to the plesiosaur. [plesiosaur calls out] [Dana] Test Subject Number Two Discovered. But we'll have to venture into the water to know for sure. Shall we? Aren't you going to put on a bathing suit? This is my bathing suit, silly-- minus the over- dress and bonnet. What do you wear? [gasp] This is my bathing suit. But your shoulders are exposed! I'll go get something to help us float on. Hey, Dana, what're you up to? I just met Mary Anning from the 1800's. We're trying to figure out who a fossil belongs to. Great. Have a good time. Just stay where I can see you. Ugh, sorry... sir. Hey, did you find who your fossil belongs to? [Dana] Not yet, but my friend is helping. It's too small to belong to a Spinosaurus, but it may have been a flipper that belonged to a plesiosaur. Hey, that's the one you showed us before. Need any help? Sorry. Girls only. What is the matter? Boys. You're telling me! In my time, boys thought they were the only ones who could know anything about fossils. But they came around, and they saw what I found. Some boys just need more time to realize girls' abilities. In the meantime, we do what we want. [roar] Let's get in the water before the plesiosaur gets away. [***] [Dana] Here she comes... [Mary] Let's compare the two. It's not a match. The fossil is bigger. [Mary] And the plesiosaur does not look happy. I don't think it wants us playing with its flippers. Let us make haste. [plesiosaur growls] [Mary] Oh no! [Dana] We can't paddle away fast enough! [Mary] He'll soon be upon us! What's going on? What's that? [water bubbling] Whoa! It's the Archelon! Whoa! [Mary] And look! The plesiosaur is retreating! Whoa, we're really high up. Whoa, it's amazing. [both giggle] Whoa. Oh my! Okay... Okay... [grunting] [Mary] Be careful! Thanks for saving us, Archelon. [grunting and snorting] [gasp] Mary, look at its flipper! Could it be? [Dana] Spots and stripes! [Mary] So cool. It's a match. This fossil is an Archelon flipper! [both] Bye, Archelon! It was a delight to be in the field with you today, Dana. I hope we have the opportunity to work together again. So do I. [Mary] Goodbye! [***] [**] Hey, our volleyball popped on something. We dug around and we think we found a fossil. Come help us figure out what it is. So, you've realized my abilities... Yes. Good. You, get the skipping ropes... You two, grab the shovels. We're gonna need to set up a dig site! [***] [**] [Dana] Next up, more Dino Dana! [***] [Dana] Dino Dana! [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] [theme music, various dinosaurs roaring] Dino Dana! [roar] [Dana] "Dino Rescue Train." [whistle] [Dana] This is so exciting! Aren't you excited, Sara? We get to ride a miniature train! Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga! Fun times! Sure. Just sure? You used to love trains. Yeah, when I was like six. [whistle] [***] [**] [whistle] I have an idea how to make this train ride more exciting for you. Does it involve dinosaurs? How'd you know? Just a lucky guess. What's your idea, Dana? [Dana] Well, sometimes when I'm bored, I imagine I'm doing something else. So, instead of just riding on a train... We could be on a dino rescue train, searching for dinosaurs! Or... we could be rescuing cute baby dinos! Even better! Great imagining, seester. [Sara] How should we start? [Dana] Rescue Mission Number one: Rescuer Sara and Rescuer Dana are trying to save a baby... Triceratops! Aw, great choice. From a hungry... T-rex. You're good at this. ...on board their dino rescue train. Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, rescuuuue! [laugh] Baby triceratops spotted. [squeak] [roar] The baby's not fast enough to outrun a T-Rex. You're right-- A T-Rex could run as fast as a bike. She'll easily catch up to a baby triceratops. What're we going to do? All aboard. Conductor, bring us beside the baby! We need to get him on this train! [roar] ...And fast. Baby triceratops, hop on board! [frightened squeaking] He's not listening, Rescuer Dana. Try using some food as bait. [Sara] Veggies, meat, or fish? Triceratops are herbivores. Which means they eat plants. Lettuce it is. Hey, baby triceratops! Want some tasty lettuce? [squeak] It's not working, Rescuer Dana. That doesn't make any sense. [sigh] If we can't get the baby on board, maybe we can lure the T-Rex away. Smart thinking, Rescuer Sara. T-Rex are carnivores. Which means they eat meat. Beef jerky it is. Hey, T-Rex! Want some yummy beef jerky? Look, he wants it! He wants it! [growl] Seems like the T-Rex is as fast as this miniature train, too. Conductor, full speed ahead! [whistle] The baby triceratops is safe. Throw the meat lure. Hey, T-Rex! You want this? [growl] Then go get it! [Dana] It worked! Good job. Triceratops high-three. [roar] [***] [whistle] Ah... That was fun. Where're you going? We saved the baby triceratops. Our first Rescue Mission is complete. But we didn't figure out why the baby didn't take the veggie bait. Are you saying you wanna take another ride on the train? Well... I guess I could go for one more ride. You sure? We don't have to. [sigh] Hop on, Dana. We're not done rescuing yet. Rescue Mission Number two: Rescuer Sara and Rescuer Dana are on a mission to figure out why the baby triceratops didn't take the veggie bait. Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga... [Dana] Woot woot! [frightened squeak] Baby triceratops and T-Rex spotted. Full stop, conductor! [brakes squeal] What's the plan, Dana? First, let's lure the T-Rex away so we can figure out why the baby didn't take the lettuce. Meat lure coming up! Hey T-Rex, want some more yummy beef jerky? [snarl] [sniff] [Dana] It's working! Hey, baby triceratops! Now's your chance to run! [triceratops squeaks, T-rex growls] Why is the baby triceratops running after the T-Rex? Good question. I have never seen anything like this before. Maybe the baby isn't running after the T-Rex. Maybe he's running towards the beef jerky! But I thought you said triceratops were herbivores. They are... Or they're supposed to be. Then why would it want the beef jerky? We'll have to perform a taste test. But first we've gotta deal with the T-Rex. Hey, T-Rex! Ya hungry? Then go... get it! Hey, baby triceratops. Do you like beef jerky too? [squeak] Then here you go! [delighted chittering] Whoa! He's eating meat. Taste test complete. The triceratops didn't take the veggie bait because he likes to eat beef jerky. Nice work, Rescuer Sara. Triceratops high three. [imitates dino roar] [whistle] Not so fast, Dana. What do you mean? We figured out the baby triceratops likes meat more than veggies, so our second Rescue Mission is complete. But we didn't figure out why the baby ate the beef jerky when it's supposed to be a herbivore. We need to take another ride. Looks like someone likes trains again. Uh, I-- I didn't say that. But you are saying you wanna go for another ride. Well... I do if you do. Ehh.... I do! Rescue Mission Number Three: Rescuer Sara and Rescuer Dana are on a mission to figure out why the baby triceratops ate meat when it's supposed to be a herbivore. [both] Chugga, chugga... Woot woo! [triceratops snorting] Baby triceratops spotted! Full stop, conductor! And looks like his mom's here with him, too. [mother grunts, baby squeaks] Let's taste test if the mom triceratops eats meat or veggies. That way we'll know for sure if they're herbivores or carnivores. Whoooo's hungryyyy?! [mother snorts, baby squeaks] [growling] [mother sniffs food, baby squeaks] Huh? That doesn't make any sense. Why does the baby eat meat, but the mom doesn't? Maybe it's like me and the trains. Are you saying the baby gets bored of meat? No... I'm saying there's some things you like when you're younger that you don't really like when you get older. That's it! Sometimes baby animals eat different things so they can grow faster and stronger, so that way they can get away from big dinos like the... [roar] [Sara] T-Rex!! Quick, Sara, throw some more beef jerky! Bad news. We're out of beef jerky. Conductor, full steam ahead! [whistle] [growling and snarling] [growling and snarling] [T-rex roars, baby triceratops squeaks] [snarling and growling] [whistle] We did it! We got away. And we figured out the triceratops are herbivores, except when they're babies. All our Dino Rescue Missions are complete. Triceratops high-three! [imitates roar] [giggle] That was actually pretty fun. I guess some things you thought you didn't like anymore, you actually do. Nah. I still don't love trains... But I've always loved hanging out with my little seester. [***] [**] * [continuous theme music] * * [music continues] * * [music continues] * [music ends] [***]
