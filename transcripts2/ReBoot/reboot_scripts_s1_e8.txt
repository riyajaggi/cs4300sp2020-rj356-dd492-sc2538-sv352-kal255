Bring out the mondo cannon ball! (clang) (binomes groaning) -Think it's big enough, Enzo? -I've got it all processed, Dot! Bigger is better! We'll chip away at his fort blast by blast! (groaning) (clang) Aloha, General User! (bang) (clunk) Bummer. -(whistling overhead) -I should've used more powder! Who-o-oa! (blam!) -BOB: Cool! Glitch, stats! -Bob! Hurry! Big cannonballs! Big powder! It's our only hope! -BOB: Shh...! -ENZO: What are you doing?! That won't even make a dent! -BOB: Trust me. (click, bang) (boom) (whistling getting closer) (BOOM!) {\an8}-SYSTEM VOICE: Game over. -DOT: Quality shot! -BOB: Deleted HIM, huh? -Yeah... ♪ -BINOME: Alright, Bob! -(cheering) -Checked him out! -What a shot! -Multitasking ze large parties... ZIZ is what I hate! -Bob, tell us again how you beat the User! -Yeah! Download us, Bob! -Well, I just spotted his weak sector, calculated the angle, and fired! -And POW! Blasted to bytes! -Yeah! Offlined! -Deleted! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! -BOB: What's with Enzo? Is he fully functional? -DOT: He's been like that since the Game ended. -BOB: Why so glum, Enzo? -I couldn't figure out how to beat that User... I must be Basic. -Basic?! Whoa, Don't be so rough on yourself! -Aw, you're just a little kid, Enzo. You'll get better as you develop. -Yeah, don't worry about it. It'll all come in time. -Time! Hah! Little kid?! Hmph! I don't wanna be smart later, I wanna be smart NOW! Hey...! ♪ (slamming game puck) (beep) (walls whirring) -PHONG: Perhaps you will try later, my son. As you know, I can only download wisdom to those who beat me at my game. -Of course I'd lose, I'm as Basic as Basic can get! I'm low-res, downsized, erasable, Hardly worth a backup! Someone should undo me, and-- -Enzo! -Yes? (sighs) -Come. You did not win my game, but maybe I can help anyway. I'm not supposed to let anyone, I mean, ANYONE in here... But, if you promise not to touch ANYTHING... I will show you something. -ENZO: Really?! Alphanumeric! I promise. (Phong sighs) -"YADDA-YADDA-YADDA." (whirs) ♪ -ENZO: Whoa! Double-sided! Super-cooled! -The city's Read-Only room. A storehouse of all information since the very beginning of Mainframe. -Whoa! Pixelatious! -And my favourite way to become smarter, by reading. If you promise not to touch anything, other than this window, you may stay in this room, and scan the files in memory. -Okay, cool! I wanna scan every README file in the system. -COMPUTER: Processing request. (beeping) -PHONG: When you finish, just come out this door. Be careful, young Enzo. Remember, that anything worthwhile takes time. (slam) -Yeah, but the faster I go, the more I'll know. Thanks, Phong! I'll show 'em how smart I am... I'll store every byte of data in here! ♪ -DOT: Cecil, have you seen Enzo? -What do I look like, a nanny?! (baby crying) I think not! Hmph! -BOB: I hope he's okay. -DOT: I'm sure he's fine. (beeping) -This is gonna take millions and millions of nanoseconds! This might even take one whole SECOND! There's gotta be a faster way to get smart. I know! Access information on speed setting. -COMPUTER: Processing request. Mainframe's clock speed and bit-rate determines how fast sprites can run. Faster clock speed and higher bit-rate equals greater processing power. -Uh, I just want to be smarter. -COMPUTER: Smarter than what? -Smarter than Bob! No, wait! Smarter than EVERYONE! -How much smarter? -Ooh. Uhh... Twice as much? -COMPUTER: Processing request. Changes in sprite speed must be made from the clock-speed room. -Okay... but how would I ever get there? (beeping) No way! Guided tour! Coolness! Hello? -COMPUTER: Welcome to the Mainframe clock-speed room. Do you wish to be twice as smart as everyone now...? Or later...? -Now! -(whirring) -COMPUTER: Processing request. (rumbling) -Whoa!

(clang) (cheering) -CECIL: Congratulations! -ENZO: For what?! -CECIL: For finding a way out of here! -Enzo! -Wh-o-o-o-oa! -Oof! You are my hero! -I am...? -Why, we've been trying to get out forever! -You are so SMART! -(whack, whack, whack) -DOT: And I am so lucky! My brother, the smartest boy in all of... Of... Where...ever this is... -(Bob gasps) Dot, Enzo! Stand back! Don't worry, I'LL save you! -Save us? From what? -Gee... I'm not sure! -(door opens) -DOT: Is it from that... that stranger...? -Express delivery for, uh... Dot's... uh... dinner? -Why, yes! It is! A-ha! -No, Bob! That's just the--! -(crash) -BOB: Rargh! Take that! (clatter) and THAT! -ENZO: Sorry about that. I don't know what got into him. Dot, What's wrong with Bob? Hello? Enzo to Dot? Come in? -DOT: Hmm...! Hats for sale! Best price in town! -No way...! This isn't a Game... I did this! And I didn't make MYSELF any smarter... I made everyone else DUMBER! (slam) -(slam) -Hmph! -(slam) -Showoff. -What have I done?! I've gotta set the clock-speed back to normal, before the whole city crashes! (door slams) (door slams) (zip-board whirrs) -DOT: Wooow... These aren't just for hats anymore! Hey! C... come back!

This better be somethin' simple... or we're in major trouble! -MIKE: Welcome to Video Athlete! Between the deadly User, and those oh-so-wacky Mainframers! Stay tuned for thrilling action, heart-pounding suspense! But first, this message! -Man! Clock-speed doesn't seem to affect Mike the TV at all! I guess he couldn't get any dumber. ♪ ReBoot! Coach?! Oh great... Uh oh... -In the first series of events, The athletes will rack up as many points as they can! The more, the better! But wait, there's more! These scores determine the starting positions in the winner-take-all final event, THE ELIMINATOR! Whoever wins the Eliminator, wins the Game! But now, another word from our sponsor. -ENZO: Did you hear that?! We've gotta score as many points as possible! Or we're all... (gulp) wiped out! -BOB: Don't worry, coach! I will help you win! -DOT: WE will help you win! -Yup! You got it, Enzo! -Winning is our format! -Consider it inputted! -No problem! -BOB: Ahem...

He's not getting up from that one! (clang) (clunk) Ohh! You know THAT'S gotta hurt! What we have here is a failure to network. (audience cheering) -DOT: How are we doing, coach? Coach? -MIKE: It's time for the Eliminator, Enzo, and the User is going to be almost impossible to beat. Because of his high point total, he's starting with a big lead. The Mainframers could lose the game, the entire sector could be wiped out, and we'll all be mindless nulls. How do you feel right now? -What a ridiculous question! How do you THINK I feel?! I feel rotten! -I see. And what are your strategic plans for the rest of the game? -Strategic plans?! I'm just gonna try to win, that's what! And I'm not gonna let my team ruin it, either! (audience cheering, applauding) -There you have it, ladies and gentlemen! And you heard it here first, Coach Enzo is entering the game! ♪ -BOB: Don't worry, coach! WE'LL help you win the race! (Enzo sighs) -I was afraid of that... ♪ (whistle blows) (crash) -DOT: Coach! -You okay? (whirrs) (pinball dinging) (clang, thud) -Okay, User, I'm jammin' now! -We are helping! We are helping! -Wh-o-o-o-a! (crash) (siren) -And that sound means the User is on his final lap! C'mon, Enzo! Get up! We don't wanna be nullified! Think of your city! Think of your friends! But most of all--! (sobbing) Think of my career--! -ENZO: This is hopeless! I wonder what Bob would do... I mean the smart Bob. That's it! The smart Bob would use his brains! I had to transfer all of you to the User's team, because he REALLY needs your help to make it to the finish line! -Really?! -(chattering) -Okay! -Help the User! -ENZO: I've got some ground to make up! -(siren) -That's it! Final lap! -We are helping! We are helping! (sobs) -The User's at the finish line! (audience cheering) -I am helping to make your boots go faster! (whirrs) -I can't watch!

You knew all along, didn't you? -Oh, wha... what? Uh, were you talking to me? -I learned a lot, Phong. More than I wanted, but... thanks anyway! You're not gonna catch me getting smart all at once! No way! -BOB: You think he's sick? -DOT: Has to be. He's so quiet, so still... -BOB: He hasn't knocked me over for at least a millisecond! -DOT: Think we should call a diagnostic program? -That's enough for today! These things take time, y'know. ♪ - (thud) -Oof! -ENZO: Anyone wanna go circuit racing, Jet-ball? Speed port? Net cutter? Jump Slot? Spooling? Vector-ball? Bob? -Naaah. -Naaah.
