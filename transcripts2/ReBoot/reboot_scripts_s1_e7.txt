You'd better wake the princess, Just in case. -AYE, Captain! (exclaims) -Can you imagine what this could mean?! -Aye, sir! A 26,000% profit margin! ♪ (uproarious laughter) -I am having no luck here, Dot. How about you? -(sighs) Whoever they are, They've got the sector sealed. We can't get past their file lockers! -(lasers firing) -Dude! Where are ya, Bob?! -Software pirates?! Oh, this is bad, this is very bad! The nets are all down... That's to be expected... Great!

(gasping) -BOB: Alright, pal... Where's my Glitch?! -"Glitch?" And what, good sir, is a "Glitch?" -Yeah, right! Don't try that on me, pirate! Hand it over! -As you wish, Guardian. -That's better. ♪ (clatter) (crashes, Bob screams) -CAPACITOR: Well?! Look alive, me hearties! We're behind schedule! -Oh. Right. -PIRATES: Heave! Ho! (pirates yelling indistinctly) (rustling) (pulsing) (whoosh) -Set a course for home, helmsman! We've just bagged the treasure of our lives! ♪ -ENZO: What is that, Dot? -I think some sort of ship... -Hey, Phong! Ya look worried! -Yeah, what's wrong? What is it? -Well, not only did they manage to steal a good many valuables from the sector, (sighs) They took... Bob. -(pop) -That's not even funny! We gotta stop 'em and get Bob back! -Phong, where are they now? -I am picking up a large portal out at sea. This must be how the pirates arrived, and how they will return! We have little time. Once they enter that portal... we may lose Bob forever. -DOT: What we need, is a ship. ♪ -BINOME: Excuse me! Excuse me? Um, heh, it's nice to see you again, Ms. Matrix, but uh... this yacht is a private format. -Ah, sorry, Mr. Mitchell, but we're commandeering your ship. -Commandeering my--! On whose authority?! -PHONG: Mine! -Oh! Heh heh! Hello, Phong. Sir. -Pardon us, Mr. Mitchell, but we have little time. The pirates are already halfway to the portal! -Pirates?! -At this distance, and their speed, you have almost no chance of catching them! -Well, we have to at least TRY! They task me, and I shall have them. ♪ What are their coordinates? -Downloading now. -MITCHELL: Um... heh heh, Surely, Ms. Matrix, there are bigger, stronger ships in the harbour? -Oh, definitely! But, as you heard, we need speed more than anything. And, in all of Mainframe, your ship is the fastest! (sobs) -So it is... -I SAID I was sorry. -Ready for castoff, boss! -(Frisket barks) -ENZO: Dot, wait! (bark) -(whine) -Aw, c'mon, Frisket! We could really use your help on this one! -DOT: Give it up, Enzo! We're running out of time! -(Frisket barking) -Oh, Frisket... Sure, NOW you wanna come...

(whirring) (whoosh) (snoring) (snore) (zap, thud) -Heh-hah! I love it when you prisoners do that! (laughing) Besides! I don't snore when I'm REALLY sleepin', no one has ever escaped from my brig! Well, except for that one. -Mouse? -Blimey! How'dya know 'er name?! -Aw, she's an old friend, and a lo-o-ong story. Didn't ya know? I'm a Guardian. I know EVERYTHING! (door opening) -CAPACITOR: Nice try, you rapscallion! But my crew doesn't scare that easily! -Well, good for them! What's your name, Guardian? My name is for my friends! -Well, mine isn't! I am the Crimson Binome! -Oh. Captain Capacitor. I've heard of ya. -Of course you have! This is Mister Jimmy, and you've already met Princess Bula... (♪ tribal drums) -Is she... really a princess? -No. You wanna tell her different? -What I want is for you to let me go... Before I make more trouble for you than I'm worth! (uproarious laughter) -No, my boastful friend... I'm afraid even you could not cause that much damage. -You wish... -An admirable try, Guardian, but I'm afraid these bars are too-- (zap) -Well, blow me down! How'd he manage to squeeze through that?! -Never mind HOW! Just follow him! (♪ tribal drums) (crash) -MISS SALLY: Captain! -Yes...? -Yer needed at the wheel, sir. We've got company! A ship, gainin' off our stern! -Tah... On my way, ensign... ♪ -Thanks, Mouse. Wherever you are, I owe you one. I think it's time to make this voyage... unprofitable! Heh heh heh... -I do not understand... -DOT: What is it, Phong? -For some unexplained reason, the pirate ship has just... stopped. You will have no problem catching them now, child... I do not understand... -I do. -Bob. -(Frisket growls) (pirates yelling indistinctly) (explosion) -It's the rudder he's got this time, Captain. Blown clear off! -Ohh... new rudder, 10,100, wasted ammo, 700... -Bula! Have you captured the Guardian yet?! (♪ tribal drums) -ALMOST! -Unidentified vessel, you are ordered to stand down! -I am NOT unidentified, my good lady! I am the Crimson Binome! Captain of this ship! And you...? -Uhhh... ADMIRAL Matrix! It is pointless to resist! We've dealt with your kind before! -This, I greatly doubt... For we always win! Always! So it is you, I beg, who should stand down and leave... for your own good, madam. (pirates yelling, explosions) (laughs) -It doesn't look like you're winning to me! Prepare to be boarded, and to hand over our stolen property! -Tah... You know we're only in this for the profit, miss! But if it's a fight you want, then it's a fight you'll have! You have been warned! -Okay, people! We're goin' in! -Right! Mister Edwards! Open fire on the approaching vessel! All guns! -Uhh... It's about the Guardian, sir. He, uh, damaged the cannons. -DAMAGE?! How much damage?! -Uhh... we only have, uh... one left. -Very well, then! Fire away with... with... with whatever! We haven't all day, Mister Edwards! -Aye, Captain... (whirring) -(cannon fires) -DOT: Incoming...! (clang) (Frisket whining) -ENZO: Way to go, Frisket! -(woof!) -(clang) -Well, blow me down! -Shifting engine coils, asymmetric magnetics, now! -Have at you, you scurvy knaves! -We're comin', Bob!

Before accidents happen to your friends! -(organizer beeps) -PHONG: Dot! Can you read me?! Dot! -I'm afraid your friends won't BE returning, old sprite! By the code of the high sea, They be our worthy spoils of victory to do with as we please! We, the ship and crew of the Crimson Binome! -You won't get away with this, fish bait! -Ah, but I already have, m'lad! Yes? -The rudder's back online, cap'n! We're on our way! -Ah, ha-hah! Good work! -She's a sorry profit margin, sir... Heavy damage, wasted supplies, significant downtime... Even WITH the Guardian, We're nowhere near our usual 200 Percent. -200 Percent?! You call THAT a profit margin?! (scoffs) Oh, please! -And you could do better?! -Much. Oh, but don't take my word for it, take a look for yourself. You've got all my spreadsheets right there. The password is... Guardian... -"Guardian?!" (slyly) Dot... -Aye, that she does sir, look! (whistles) As the sea flows...! How can such profits be possible?! -Well, they ARE when you don't attack your customers. -She's got a point, Captain. Without damage repairs, refits, lost loading time due to initial attack phase, increased personnel efficiency, At least 1962 Percent! Heh, of course, that's a conservative estimate, heh. -Ahh, but you've forgotten about accrued depreciation on upgrades! -No, I haven't! Simply sell volume at discount, to lower-grade systems. -Touché. -You stay out of this, Mister! -(zap) -Then, uh... how do you offset market flux? -Diversification. -Initial inventory outlay?! -Amortization. -Demand drop-off?! -Become a buyer! (exclaims) (pops, yells) -Huh?! -It's okay, Bob, it's okay! They're on our side, now. -Our side?! What do you mean, our side? How did-- Dot...? -DOT: I have hundreds of clients who would pay premium for inter-system transport of your calibre, for a percentage, of course. -Of course! Ah, do tell me more, Admiral Matrix. -Please, Captain Capacitor. Call me Dot. (chuckles) Actually, my name's Gavin. -Did she... with her... And now they're going into business together? -Major. -Well, blow me down. ♪
