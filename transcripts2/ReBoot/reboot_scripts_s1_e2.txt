 ReBoot (1994–2002): Season 1, Episode 2 - Racing the Clock - full transcript 
 Enzo is doing his own delivery service at his sister's diner. Only he hasn't received any deliveries so far. Things seem hopeless for him until Megabyte's Vid Window comes up on line telling Enzo that he has a package that needs to be delivered to Hexadecimal, a multi-mask wearing virus who lives at the scarce location of Los Angles. Knowing Megabyte to be bad news in all, but Enzo couldn't resist in doing a single delivery order. He didn't tell Dot or Bob on who sent the package, but both Dot and Bob agree that it's too dangerous for a Sprite like Enzo to deliver a package in Los Angles, so Dot insists that Bob delivers it. The package in fact is a mask shape time bomb that will delete whoever is in possession of it. Hexadecimal is aware of this and puts the mask on Bob and sends him flying back to Mainframe. Enzo heard the news, then told Dot, and they now need to warn Bob about the mask he has right now. But a Game Cube is being inputted and Bob heads for the landing site for the Cube. Dot and Enzo followed him and made it inside the game which is a Racing Game. But will they manage to tell Bob to get away from the mask before time runs out?

 Enzo's Overwrite Delivery Service! Anyone, Anywhere, Anytime! -Hi, it's Jean-Luc! Is this Dot's Data-Compression Take-out? -No, wrong number... ( sighs ) -CECIL: Is this a sign of things to come? ( slam ) -DOT: Hey Enzo. How's your new delivery service coming along? -Oh, great! Just huge! Seriously active! I was written for this format! I'm going multi! Quality! Major, even! I'm crunching' along at high-baud, and proud of it! Call me whenever... -DOT: Enzo! -ENZO: Yes? -We're glad to hear it! -DOT: Yeah! We'll be downstairs if you need us. Bob's going to mend a tear that showed up after the last Game. -Okay, coolness! We're talking high-density here! You'll see! I'm gonna be as successful as you sometime, Dot! ( sighs ) As soon as I get some orders. ♪ ( ringing ) ENZO, SLEEPY: Enzo's Overwrite Delivery Service... Anyone, Anywhere, Anytime. -MEGABYTE: Enzo! -Mega-breath?! Uh, I mean... Megabyte? -I understand... you have a new delivery service. -Well, it's not EXACTLY new... If you call 31 nanoseconds new. But, it was a way for me to be just like my awesome sister, Dot. And also to get to fly around on a zip-board, making dangerous deliveries to far-off places that... -Enzo! -Yes? -MEGABYTE: What a persuasive sales-sprite you are... You've convinced me to use your service for ALL my deliveries... -Alphanumeric! You mean it?! -HACK: Oh my! -All the deliveries for you and your whole evil empire?! -SLASH: Oh my! -All the deliveries for you and your whole evil empire?! All the deliveries for you and your whole evil empire?! Whoa, coolness! That must be a lot! Wait till Dot hears about this! Oops. She'll say no. She hates your guts. -Very well. ( sighs ) I suppose I can always find someone else to process daring deliveries to exotic places. -No, no, no, no, no, I can do it! I'll just... uh... Tell her later! Yeah, that's it! -Perhaps. But first, I have to see how you handle a test program. -ENZO: You can count on me! This may be my first after-school function, But I'll show Dot that I'm big enough to handle-- Oof! -MEGABYTE: Take this package to Hexadecimal... But whatever you do... Don't tell her who sent it... -Ohhh, it's a surprise! -Precisely... -No problem, Mister Byte! ( monitor beeps ) ( Megabyte laughs ) ( purring ) ( surging ) -DOT: Any luck? -BOB: No... Wait! Here it comes... Watch your eyes! ( surging ) Glitch, mend. ( beaming ) ( whirring ) -ENZO: Dot! Bob! I did it! Ahem... I mean, I did it. I received my very first order! -BOB: No way! -It's true! -DOT: Congratulations! -Well, gotta zip! I wouldn't want to be late to Hexadecimal's on my first delivery! -DOT: Okay, be careful out there! -Hexadecimal?! -Hexadecimal?! ( whirring ) -Whoa! -DOT: Did you say Hexadecimal?! -ENZO: Yeah? -DOT: Who sent this package? -Uh... it was, uh... some guy named uh... Jean-Luc! Yeah, that's it! -BOB: Why would anyone send a package to Hex? What's in it? A bomb? -I don't know. It's a surprise. -A bomb. -A bomb. -Better access what's inside, just to be safe. Glitch, X-ray. ( whirring ) Looks like a mask... with a clock in it? -DOT: I wonder if there's a market for something like that... -See? It's not a bomb. Can I go now? -Enzo, I can't let you go to Hexadecimal's island. -Huh? Oh, sure. I know what your problem is, You don't want the competition! You don't want me to succeed! Enzo's the little-brother-format, and Dot's the big businesswoman who... -No, Enzo. It's too dangerous! -She's right, Lost Angles is no place for a little sprite like you. -ENZO: Hey! You're supposed to be on my side! My business is doomed. End of file. Log off. I give up. I'll never be as cool as Dot. -Oh, compile up. Act your age! There's a simple solution to every problem. Bob, you deliver the package, just this once. Enzo, you continue your business, and don't quit-file so easily! And make it snappy, Bob! We've got more fixes left in here. -BOB: ( sighs ) How does she do that? -ENZO: What? Get everyone else to do all the work? -BOB: Yeah! -ENZO: Don't ask me. I've been trying to figure that one out forever! ♪ -HEXADECIMAL: So many moods... So little time... ( sighs ) ( happily ) Scuzzy...! ( angry ) How DARE you interrupt me when I'm putting on my face! I shouldn't have done that, I was GLAD to see him... How good to see you, Scuzzy... What have you got for me...? -MEGABYTE: A delete command, masked as a mask. She'll never know what erased her. Now all I need is some unsuspecting fool to deliver it... Like this poor boy... -HEX: Delete ME, will he?! Time to calculate a little surprise -( Scuzzy chitters exitedly ) -for our dear Megabyte. I'll delete him... and his delivery boy too... ( cackles ) -( sighs ) This is the way it always goes. I miss all the cool stuff! ( zap ) ( zap ) -AAAHH! -See? Well, if I can't make the delivery, I can always watch! -BOB: Why do I always get lost in Lost Angles? ( swarming squealing ) There's nothing worse than having to ask a null for directions. ( whistling ) ( thud ) Well, almost nothing! Go on, shoo! Find someone else's energy to eat! AAH! Oof! -HEX, SEDUCTIVELY: Bob...! -BOB: Hexadecimal. -HEX: I didn't expect it to be... you... -Well, I'm sorry, but I've always been me! I have a package for you. Enzo's Overwrite Delivery! -HEX: A package for me...? Whatever could it be...! ( shatters ) A mask! What a shame... I already have one... You'll have to return it to Megabyte, with my regrets. -Megabyte sent this?! Y'know, returning things isn't really part of my function. Have a good one! -HEX: I said, take it back! ( muffled yelling ) ( ringing tone ) -Whoa! ( Bob screaming ) Uh... Bob? That must be Hexadecimal's... hole in the ground! -HEX: Bob should get to Megabyte's tower just as the clock reaches zero. Oh, I'd like to see Megabyte's face when his own time-delete bomb goes off! ( spring ) I don't want to see it NOW! How diabolical of him... to hide a delete command in a harmless mask... I wish I'd thought of it. -Dude! Bob's in major trouble, and it's all my fault! Aah! -Strange. That looks just like Bob! ♪ No! Stop! Oof! -ENZO: We gotta warn Bob that the mask he's delivering is really a bomb of Megabyte's! And I didn't want to tell you it was from him, cause you never let me input anything exciting! But I didn't know it was gonna get Bob in trouble, and now he's flying to Megabyte's, it's gonna blow up any nanosecond if we don't...! -DOT: Enzo, Enzo! Slow down! Now let me get this straight. The package... from Megabyte? Is a bomb? And Bob... has no idea. I see what you mean. We've gotta warn Bob! While there's still a Bob to warn. ( muffled yelling ) -Deliver a package to Megabyte? From Hexadecimal? I don't think so. Glitch! Rotor! ( whirring ) Oof! -ENZO: There he is! -DOT: Thank goodness he's slowed down! ( long steady tone ) Oh no... Not now! ( surging ) ( thunder ) -SYSTEM VOICE: Warning, incoming game. Warning, incoming game. -He's steering towards the game! -He would. {\an8}-Warning, incoming game. {\an8}Warning, incoming game. -ENZO: Cursors and crashes! We lost him! -DOT: Maybe not. C'mon! -Whoooa! Aaaah! ♪ ( surging ) -Dot! You almost got us erased! Deleted! Offlined! Can we do it again? -Maybe later, you nut. Now, we've gotta find Bob. -ENZO: Oh yeah. -ANNOUNCER 1: Ha ha! Good to see ya again, Gary! -ANNOUNCER 2: Good to see you, Phil. -ANNOUNCER 1: Certainly is a balmy 65 degrees. -ANNOUNCER 2: Wonderful day. -ANNOUNCER 2: Absolutely, Phil. -ANNOUNCER 1: Let's shut up and race! -Looks like Formula One. Heh heh! Good thing we know the formula! ReBoot! ( others ReBooting ) ( beeping ) -ANNOUNCER: And the white car, in the pole position, Car number 5, the User car. Gentlemen, start your engines! ( ignition starts ) ( revving ) ( car starts, revving ) ( clang ) ( revving ) ( tires screeching ) -Bob! -Bob! -DOT: Bob's racing against the clock, and the clock's gonna win! You know what this means, Enzo. -ENZO: Oh boy, do I. -ReBoot! -ReBoot! -Woo hoo! ( tires screeching ) ENZO: Whoops. Dot! Wait up! -BOB: Excuse me. Pardon me. Thank you. Don't mind me, I'm just taking the lead. Whoa! Of course, I could be wrong! ( crash ) BOB: This is Formula One, NOT BUMPER CARS! ( tires screeching ) I hate when that happens. ( clang ) Aah! That... was close. Oh no you don't... ( beep ) 18th place?! Man, I'm really back here! Of course, that's what nitros are for! ( whirring ) Woo! -Major! -Enzo, how'd he do that? -ENZO: Nitros! Push the button on your steering wheel! Whoooooa! -Whooooa! -Whooooa! -BOB: Dot? -DOT: Your car is a bomb! -BOB: You're tellin' me! It only comes with one nitro! -DOT: No! The mask was really...! -Cool! -BOB: So, she made it to level 2. Let's see who gets to level 3! -DOT: Oof! -ENZO: You okay, Dot? -DOT: Fine, just go! We're Bob's only hope! ( beep ) -ENZO: There they are! ( thud ) -Minefield! Slalom! ( explosions ) -ENZO: Braaakes! -DOT: No time! We'll take the high road! ( pop ) -ENZO: No way, Dot! -DOT: It's all in the reflexes. -Whooooa! -Whooooa! ( beep ) -BOB: Ya haven't lost me yet! -Bob! -Bob! ( beep ) -ENZO: Now what? There's gotta be a way to access Bob's attention before he's deleted! Oh, it's all my fault... If only I'd copy-and-pasted the truth at the start, he would never be... -DOT: Enzo, I think I have an idea. ( beep ) DOT: THIS should get his attention! ( horn honking ) ( beep ) Now, Enzo! ( gasps ) -Glitch! ( beep ) ( explosion ) -Bob! -ENZO: Dude... No way... Bob! ( surging ) {\an8}-SYSTEM VOICE: Warning, Game corruption. -ENZO: Yes! Bob, you're okay! -BOB: Not good! This is not good! It's an infinite data ELSE-IF loop. -DOT: Uh, what's that mean? -BOB: It means... RUN LIKE YOU'VE NEVER RUN BEFOOOORE! ( pulsing ) ( crumbling ) ( clamouring ) ( yelps ) ( yells ) ( explosion ) ( boing ) ( explosion ) -Phew... -ENZO: Bob! -Oof! Megabyte hid a delete command in the mask, just like you said! Only you didn't know, because I should've copy-and-pasted the truth from the start, But, will you ever forgive me for inputting you in so much... -DOT: Enzo! -Dot! Bob and I are sharing a camaraderie after the game! -BOB: You risked your life to come into the game and save me. -DOT: Well, I couldn't let anything happen to you. -BOB: You couldn't? -No. Enzo would've blamed himself for it. -Oh. But Dot... ( vid window pops, bonk ) -MEGABYTE: Enzo, You failed me completely! -Why thank you! -You're fired! -Oh, you know, I'm sooo disappointed! -MEGABYTE: I have found someone else to deliver my packages. -HACK: Hexadecimal said, -SLASH: Yeah, Hexadecimal, -HACK: She said, -SLASH: She said she already has one! -HACK: She said she already has... -HACK: She said she already has one! -SLASH: Has one? She did. -HACK: I said that! -SLASH: I know. ( loud explosion ) -MEGABYTE: Hack... Slash...! -HACK: Uh oh! -SLASH: I think he means us. ( clang )
