 (ReBoot - 1x04: Medusa Bug: EN-SDH) -BOB, V.O.: I come from the net, through systems, peoples, and cities, to this place. Mainframe. My format, Guardian. To mend and defend. To defend my new-found friends, their hopes and dreams. To defend them from... their enemies.

I was a fool to trust you! -How true... -It WAS, however, very clever, the way you tricked me out of one of my toys... But whatever could you do with it? Just a little trinket. You might as well give it back... -Really, Hexadecimal, I don't have time for this... -Ohh, how very, very sad... ( sniffs ) I'll have to... destroy you all, then.

Perimeter secured, sir! -MEGABYTE: Very well. My dear Hexadecimal, I am so disappointed in you. It was her fault, you know, her increased security, and strict privacy lead me to my victory. She was so careful, so secretive... I knew she was up to something... And yet, despite the length and scope of our operation, We still do not know the true nature of the Medusa's power...

( engine struggling ) ( thud ) ( engine starts ) -But Frisket...! -DOT: Look, Enzo, we can't help Frisket if the same thing happens to us. Don't worry, we'll be back. When we know what we're dealing with. Bob, what is that thing?! -We need to see Phong. Now. -PHONG: It is a bug, pure and simple. It can, and will, spread to anything it touches. We are all at risk. You, Bob, however, may be immune, since you are a Guardian, It is difficult to tell. -Trust me, I don't wanna find out. But I DO want to get out there and warn everybody. -We need a plan, first. -Poor Frisket... I'll bet old Mega-dump is behind all this! I say we crash his tower, big-time! -I dunno, Enzo. This one isn't his style, It's too unpredictable, too dangerous. -It's completely random, almost chaotic. -Hexadecimal? -Bingo. -( terminal beeps ) -PHONG: It MUST be her... Look, even the Tor has been infected. -ENZO: But not Hex's island! -Hexadecimal, huh? This one's got me worried, Phong. I mean, that Hex is as loopy as they come! I'm gonna need everything you've got to fight it. -Bob, worried? Dude... -Worse yet, children, is that the longer one is infected, the sooner they begin to decay...

What are we gonna do?! -PHONG: Dot, you and Enzo get everyone evacuated from the city. It is next in the bug's path. -DOT: Right! -PHONG: Bob, you come with me. We must hurry. "Greek Action." ( wall whirs ) -Hey, you two be careful out there. -You too. ( computer beeping ) -BOB: I'll need two high-line viricidals, self adjusting, And a level 8 desktop rebuilder, wide fielding. ( blink, blink ) What? -This is not the Supercomputer, Bob. I'm afraid this is all we have to offer. ( beeps ) -BOB: "Virus erase command?" Don't you think that's a little primitive? ( sighs ) -Perhaps, but it is the best we have. -Hm... I suppose if we boost its power with an add-on, It MIGHT do the trick. Crude, but simple. -Then let us make it so. ♪ ( air brakes hissing ) ( baby crying ) -DOT: Chin up, we're almost there. -Bob! I-it's Bob! -Alright, Bob! Woo-hoo! You show 'em they can't mess with us!

( echoing ) NOOOO! NOOOO! No... ( sighs ) You were right, old friend. I AM immune. (sarcastically) Lucky me. Let Hexadecimal turn all my friends into stone... destroy Mainframe, and get away with it?! I don't think so. ♪ -HEX: How do you like my new garden, Scuzzy? It holds up so much better than some of my earlier members... ( comical sliding ) Well, uh, for now, at least. Does it please you...? I ASKED YOU A QUESTION! ( shoots wire ) ( Bob yells ) HEX, NONCHALANT: Funny... I sense a presence. -BOB: That would be ME! -HEX, AMUSED: That's a good one, Guardian! Infect ME with the Medusa? How delightfully clever! -Why, thank you! ( energy charging ) -Now, we can't have any of THAT, young man! And you...? IMMUNE to my Medusa? Tsk tsk tsk... How very disappointing.
