 is called to decide on the request for precautionary suspension against prosecutor Guerra, Elena. Prosecutor Guerra, having learned that Angelica Petroni, a murder victim, was her biological daughter, did not refrain from performing her functions as a public prosecutor. The Disciplinary Section of the High Council orders... her suspension from the position of magistrate. The hearing for judgment on the matter is set for the 20th of September in the current year. Well, let's read the ruling. In the name of the Italian people, given article 530 of the Code of Criminal Procedure... the criminal court... - acquits Monaco, Linda... - Yes!

Mrs. Monaco, how are you feeling? - Mrs. Monaco! Give us a statement! - How are you feeling? Mrs. Monaco, how are you feeling? The court did not give credit to Zaia's testimony. Justice has been served, today is a bright day. The only shadow is that of Angelica Petroni's real murderer, who unfortunately is still out there. I am sorry for Maurizio and Paola Petroni. - Thanks for everything. Enough, sorry. - But the real... The real mother is Elena Guerra. What do you think of her? - As they say... - "No comment." - Who is the killer, do you have any idea? - Thank you, enough. - We don't give statements. - Mrs. Monaco, a statement. - Tell us… - What will you do now? - Mrs. Monaco! - Mrs. Monaco! Take me away. They'll decide in six months, and, in the meantime, they have suspended me. - And the trial? - Acquitted. - There is a silver lining, though. - Really? You're on holiday. Uh, I just retired. I also asked that they remove my security detail. We are free. We can... stay in Rome, why not? I have to go back, but... Maybe another time, Dad. So, where shall I take you? Take me back to prison. Are you sure? Yes, I'm very sure. Mrs. Monaco... your lucky charm. - Do you want to see if it's all in there? - I already have everything. Yes. Sign here, please. It was a pleasure. - Hi. - Hello. How are you? At best, in six months they'll send me to the most remote DA's office in Italy - and at worst, I have to find another job. - So why did you come? To find out how much I influenced the verdict. I shouldn't tell you. I know. If you hadn't brought me that receipt, it would've ended in a different way. Okay, thanks. But you did the right thing. You had an innocent acquitted. Don't think about it anymore. I'll try. YOUR ULTRASOUND APPOINTMENT IS ON MARCH 27TH AT 4:30 P.M. IS THAT OKAY FOR YOU? OKAY Have you finished the restoration? No. No, I stopped working on it. Why? I don't... I don't know. What kept me going was... knowing that Linda Monaco had killed her, and that she would pay for what she'd done. - I made you believe it, I'm sorry. - No, it's not your fault. I want to let Angelica go... but I can't, if I don't know who killed her. I can't. Is everything all right? What are you doing?

Try clapping your hands. - Why? - Try clapping your hands. - Wow. - It's a house full of secrets. I feel I'm being watched. You're wrong, because it's just you and me. And your father? Do you care about my father? You don't. This is what worries me. It's true... he used whores to... to buy some favors. Oh! And he was certainly wrong to threaten Angelica, but he certainly didn't kill her. Are you really convinced of that? - Yes. - Hm. Is that a problem for you? You asked me not to lie to you, so yes, it is a problem for me. Are you leaving? Linda, I'm convinced it was him. I don't want to be here, I don't... I don't know. Don't you think maybe you could be wrong? Couldn't you be wrong? I don't think so. You do because you care about him, but... Of course I care about him. You, I don't. Nice. Nice. Maybe I love you. That's why I'm sorry... and I'll be sorry if you go and leave me here alone tonight. And the next few nights, perhaps. - I'm sorry. - Don't leave me alone, please. Elena! Elena! I'm coming! Come and see! He was one of the key witnesses in the trial of Linda Monaco. - Look. Already on the list of suspects for attempted extortion, Nicola Tomei is now also a suspect in the murder of Angelica Petroni. They found something of Angelica's in his house. It's still not clear which weapon was used, nor the exact circumstances of the crime. But Tomei's alibi, asserted by prosecutor Elena Guerra in the trial against Linda Monaco, - is now swept away by new evidence. - It was him. So the grounds for a new trial for the Petroni murder are taking shape. Let's hear from the prosecutor, Antonio Caputo. But Tomei's alibi, asserted by prosecutor Elena Guerra in the trial of Linda Monaco, is now swept away by new evidence. So the grounds for a new trial for the Petroni murder are taking shape. I didn't want to wake you up. ...prosecutor Antonio Caputo. The evidence found at Tomei's home is strong, probative. We are confident of a quick resolution to a murder that has shaken our city. - How many hearings do you expect? - I can't tell. "Give to a gracious message a host of tongues..." Uh... What was the... A Shakespeare quote? I do not remember. My memory is... is gone. But it's the first part that counts. Was it Tomei? It was you who first found out about him. You were right. And you, in choosing Ruggero to defend me. Oh! So, what do you say? - Have I been acquitted too? - You got away with it, at least in the first degree. That's enough for me. Ah... So... - Hm? - Why not? Come. Take these keys. They'll open many doors. Yes? - Hi, Antonio. - Hi. - Do you have a minute? - Of course. - Take a seat. - Thanks. - I suppose you want to know about Tomei. - Yes, indeed. Ah... Well, what can I tell you... You were mistaken about those cell phone towers. It happens. So he first left the party and then came back? Evidently. On the other hand, the phone was turned off. How did you realize that he did it? Angelica's backpack. He had it hidden on a mezzanine. De Luca's team found it. You search for evidence of extortion, and look what comes up. Why would he keep it? How should I know? A fetish, maybe. The guy's bonkers. Nothing that he says makes sense. He had a nervous breakdown. Or he's playing the mental illness card. Aah. - Hi. - Hello. Oh, God, it's cold. - How are you? - You know. Tell me everything. I heard the official version, but what about the rumors? The rumor is that he did it. They even found the backpack. Did you read Tomei's reports? - Let's say... yes, I took a look at them. - And? He denies it, but... he is confused. He contradicts himself continually. I don't think he did it. No. Call it instinct. Yes, but he had an object in his house that only the killer could have, and the receipt proves that Linda was inside at that time. I know, I know. But the truth is, I keep wondering what the fuck happened that night. In my opinion, Barone knows. - So go talk to him. - Why would he talk to me? He got what he wanted. Just try. Trust me. I should trust you? I mean, when did I ever make a mistake? It was Linda. And this is the meeting room. Nice, huh? A gift for you. How nice. - What is it? - Open it. Did you give me pajamas? Think how nice it would look on the door. But you hang it, you need a symbolic gesture. Like this? Is this how you treat those who bring you work? Ruggero, everything you wanted is here. No more murders, no more blood, a shitload of money. Come on, Ruggero. Let's make peace. Look how beautiful it is. Think about how much fun we can have here in Rome, my hometown. Yes, we could indeed. On one condition. You know I hate conditions. But since it's you... shoot. You're the new Lorenzi, the one who fixes things. I think Lorenzi was there that night. He killed Angelica Petroni, following Monaco's order, then he took a souvenir to place where he needed it to be at the right time. Did you do it? Do you really think I put the backpack - in that loser's house? - Just answer, yes or no. You knew the place, you had been there. - You're paranoid. - Maybe. But if I have to join the family, I need to know who its members are. I didn't put the backpack there. And there are no saints in the family, but no killers either. Ruggero, look where you are. Look at that office. That's all you ever wanted. Your dream came true. Enjoy it. It's just a tiny dot, - but we can already hear the heart. - Aah. But... how far along am I? Can you tell exactly? Yes, six weeks. - Hello. - Hi. - Is everything all right? - Mm-hm. - Shall we go? - Where? The moment has come. The moment for what? To find out if you're still afraid of water. Come on. - But why? - Because I say so. Give me your hand. Come on. - Put a foot here. - Wait. How's it going? It's going. Slowly, please, go slowly. It wasn't that hard, was it? Yes, I mean... We must overcome our fears, sooner or later. Maybe you're right. But even living with them... and not forgetting helps. It helps me understand who I am. Two ways to see it. Mm... two ways to live it. She was the one keeping us together. And now that she's gone... But we loved each other, didn't we? A lot. It's over with Stefano. I have to start over, alone. I'm done running away. And you want to start over in here? This is where she spent her last moments. And I wanted to come back here with you because... the situation is the same as it was years ago, - and what I have to tell you too. - Meaning? Do you remember when the last time we were here was? Of course. Do you mean that... It's no coincidence that I chose a non-alcoholic beer. Well, this is good news. Mm. Whose is it? I don't know, and this is a little less good news. Did you tell either of the... two? Let's say they have the right not to know for now. Hm. What a mess. Well, compared to last time, - there is a difference. - That I'm older? That you're sure to keep it. Yes, I am. - No! It's mine. - Don't even think about it. I've already decided. I'll pay. Excuse me for a moment. Excuse me, it's 7:22 p.m. But here it says 8:22 p.m., why? We never update it. It's always set to daylight saving time. ♪ Breathing, keep breathing ♪ ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing Keep breathing, keep breathing ♪ ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing ♪ ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing Keep breathing ♪ ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing Keep breathing, keep breathing ♪ ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing ♪ ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing Keep breathing ♪ ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing Keep breathing, keep breathing ♪ ♪ Keep breathing ♪ ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing Keep breathing ♪ - What are you doing here? - Your phone is disconnected. I'm taking a break. Uh... Did you want to compliment me? Linda was acquitted because of a piece of evidence I gave to Ventura. I found a receipt in her purse - from the bar inside Palazzo Te. - Mm-hm. It showed that she bought a drink during those 11 minutes, but the evidence is wrong. I just found out. The receipt shows the wrong time. Linda had drinks around 11 p.m., when she'd just got there. - So? - She was only acquitted for this reason. I wanted to let you know, since you're now living with her. That's none of your business. Linda killed Angelica and her father covered for her. - As I always said, from the beginning. - The trial is over, Elena. Not for me. Tell her a piece of evidence proved her alibi, see how she reacts. Or are you afraid to do it? Hey. I'm glad you're back. I can't be alone here. I'm here. Can you help me? Thank you. - Everything all right? - Of course. Do you want to tell me? What? - Where you're taking me for dinner. - Ah! It's our first dinner. I don't want to ruin the surprise. You're very beautiful. You too. - Are you ready? - Yes. So? No, it's wonderful. It is huge. I can have a big office there. There's also space for various associates, so... we'll see. Well, do you like it or not? Of course I like it. Why do you ask? I don't know, I... Are you sure everything's all right? No, it's not all right. You are too elegant for this place. - It's true, it clashes with you. - But no, I'm fine. This is my place. Thank you for bringing me here. - What are you saying? - It wasn't a given. There you go. Eggplant parmigiana. Our specialty. So, maybe one day, you can teach me how to make it. I'm not a great cook, but I can work hard. Oh, yes, of course! She's nice. Because she suspects this is a serious relationship, finally. And is it? I didn't think I could be happy again. The funny thing is that sometimes, I don't even understand it. Bye. Anyway, they like you very much. Really? Oh! - No! - Are you hurt? - Eh? - No... I broke my shoe. Ah. Well, we'll throw them away. No, they're my lucky charm. - Well, you have lots more. - No! We'll have them fixed. Yes! Then I'll keep them, since they bring good luck. - God, barefoot... - The car is right here. - The cobbles! Oh! - Wait. - So... no, I've got you. - I'm losing my balance. There you go, madam. Do you know why... why you were acquitted? Because you're good. Elena Guerra found a receipt that proved you were inside the palace... at midnight. Well done to her. I'll send her flowers. Hm? Why did you tell me? Didn't you want me to? You don't trust me. It's not that. It just seemed right that... you knew. Are you sure? Of course. Yes? Do you have a second? What do you want? How many times have you reviewed the facts? Every minute, every day, and even today, for a year. When I investigated Claudio, I wondered why he and Angelica had stopped calling each other in November. Angelica had another phone, a burner, since November, when they started the escort ring. She used that to talk to him, but on March 3rd, her usual phone and Claudio's phone enter the same tower area, at the same time... - I have to tell you something. - ...7:20 p.m. - I'm pregnant. - She wanted to quit. - She had just found out she was pregnant. - But you want... ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing ♪ You're a piece of shit! I know you don't give a fuck, but I'm keeping it. Do you understand? I don't want to do to it what they did to me. - Why, what did they do to you? - They put me up for adoption. - Yesterday I met my real father. - What? Want to know something else? My real mother is a lawyer. How about I tell her a few things, eh? ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing Keep breathing ♪ You can't. - You'll see! - ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing ♪ - ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing ♪ - Maybe it went like this. Claudio wants her to give up the child, but he doesn't convince her. So he calls Monaco. He was the one managing the escort ring. Claudio was just his errand boy. Monaco could not allow Angelica to report everyone... Hey. Yes, I met her. She's out of her mind. You don't understand. She'll call a lawyer. What do we do? Monaco realizes what the situation is, and in the meantime, Angelica enters Palazzo Te. ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing ♪ ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing Keep breathing ♪ ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing Keep breathing, keep breathing ♪ ♪ Keep breathing ♪ ♪ Keep breathing, keep breathing Keep breathing, keep breathing ♪ Maybe she meets Tomei and tells him that he'll get nothing more from her, because the game's going to end the next day, - and he can say whatever he wants. - Angelica. Angelica, wait! - Leave me alone! - I'll report you all. - Understand? - I don't give a damn! Loser. One more reason for him to ask Claudio for money that evening. Linda and Angelica met inside, and then it happened out there, at the back of the building, which wasn't accessible to the public. At midnight, more or less. She wants to leave and never come back. She's had enough. Linda sees her leaving the hall... And something clicks. How do you know? I asked her that question. I told her you saved her. That the receipt proved that she was inside the building at midnight, not outside, killing Angelica. And for a second, just a second, she was surprised. - Hello? - Ivan? Angelica, where are you? Tomei leaves, goes to the hotel to blackmail Claudio... - Are you kidding me? - You heard me, go away! ...while Angelica sends Zaia away. - Angelica! - Colombo hears them arguing... Angelica, I just want to talk to you. Angelica! Come here, bitch! Come on. Let's go. Come on. I believe that Monaco had given Lorenzi an order. On that, you were wrong by default. Lorenzi didn't arrive later, he was already there, waiting for her to come out so he could kill her. He lay in wait outside, in the garden, near Angelica's scooter, but he couldn't foresee that someone else would murder her when he was supposed to do it. His boss's daughter. I tried several times to imagine what they could've talked about. If Angelica provoked her, or if she was just afraid. We'll never know. Angelica, I just want to talk to you. Angelica! Come here, bitch! - What the fuck do you want? - What do you want from my husband? Money? How much do you want? - Tell me, how much? - Who do you think you are? Maybe she pushed her, maybe Angelica stumbled and fell. What makes you think that? Angelica had no trace on her. There were no signs of a fight, at least not an intense one. And for how she was killed, she had to be lying on the ground when she was hit. Why? The murder weapon. That box... closed the night of Linda's arrest and never reopened. Who do you think you are? I'm pregnant, you bitch. Oh... Dad... She had them on at the DA's office the first time I interviewed her. And during the official questioning too. She took them off in prison and they stayed there. For one year. Twelve centimeters of heel. Thin and sharp. I don't think it was premeditated. And in any case, that's how it went. Then she called her father. He called Lorenzi, who arrived a few moments later. Then it was Lorenzi who threw the body into the water. I think so. Give me the shoe. Give me the shoe! Go away. I'll take care of everything. Go! Lorenzi cleaned up the scene. He took Angelica's backpack, which has come in handy, right? But he couldn't see the cigarette butt in the vase. No, he was too busy dealing with the body. And that explains why Linda had no traces on her when she returned to the party. But these are only theories. It's something more. Her heel broke. I've offered to take her shoes to be repaired. I've ordered a new pair. It's the murder weapon, Elena. The material is porous, it retains traces of organic material even if you wash it many times. Angelica's DNA is on the heel. I had a comparison done in the lab. I couldn't have done it if I hadn't gotten that DNA to screw you. It turned out to be useful. Everything was perfect. Work, love... So why did you ask her that question? I don't like being made a fool of. What are you thinking? About the day they found the body. I was invited to talk about my profession to fifth graders. I said that we needed to stick to the facts to keep out personal issues. Otherwise I wouldn't have been good at finding the truth. Do you still believe that? As soon as I understand it, I'll know if I want to continue to be a prosecutor. If they still let me do it, of course. - You? Having a doubt? - Hm! Good! All right! I think it's a great starting point for the rest of your life. And you? What are your plans? Now I've thrown the chance of a lifetime out the window? - Ah. - No plans. But I solved the case. Oh, "I solved the case." We have. I think I've also done my part, eh? - Okay. Together. - Huh.
