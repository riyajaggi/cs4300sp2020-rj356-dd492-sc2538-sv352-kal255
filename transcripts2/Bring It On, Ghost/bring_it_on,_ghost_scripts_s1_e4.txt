 I'm doing all sorts of things. Am I doing this right? Bong-pal. How do I look? -Huh? -How do I look? Is it okay? Well... the dress is pretty. It's pretty. -Let's go. -To where? To work. -What? -It's time to pay your dues. What? Why are we working this late at night? This is a new dress! You expect me to fight in my new dress?

 24-HOUR SAUNA Yes, sir! Yes, I'll go ahead and text my account number to you. Have a good day! I should send it to those seniors. What the heck? What's going on? Yes. Right now? Yes, it's possible. Yes. -Let's go. We got work to do. -Again? -I can't. I'm way too tired. -No, they want us to come immediately. Don't you think this is too much? I'm so tired that I hit my head on the door because I couldn't go through it. -Let's take it easy today, okay? -No.

 I have to feed you and help you study tmorrow. -Don't you remember our deal? -Still, this is wrong! You're working me like a slave because of this one dress you bought me. And you said you're going to tutor me. When are we going to start studying? Okay. Let's study after we're done, okay? No, I refuse to go. Where are you going? Let's go. -I'm tired. -Hurry up. It's completely trashed in here. When are we going to clean all this up? The housing agency is going to have a fit if they find out. You're lucky you're still alive and breathing. You should be grateful. I am. I will be forever grateful and... it's time to pray. Dear God, Buddha, Allah, thank you so much... No! No, I should be thanking Bong-pal instead! He may be a jerk, but he came when I needed him most. He's a real man. How do you think he knew I was in danger? Well, the thing is... Hold on. -Oh, it's Bong-pal. -He texted you? Is he asking if I'm okay or something? He's cool. He's a pretty decent guy. -It's not that. -What did he say? Show me. Please deposit the money into my account. What is he talking about? What account? Bong-pal says he charges one million won per exorcism. One million... -One million won? -Yes. Let me get this straight. So... Bong.... So, Bong-pal really didn't come to save me. -Correct. -He's horrible. -He's calculating. -Do you have one million won? No, I do not. What are we going to do then? He's not going to let this slide. I don't know. Just ignore him! I don't know. Ignore him? I... Is Pres. Cha Chun Sang inside? I'm from the housing agency. I know you're in there! You can't keep ignoring our phone calls! It's only more trouble for you! President! President! Oh goodness. Oh goodness. How long did I sleep? I was so freaking tired. Bong-pal. Bong-pal. Bong-pal. Sorry! Hey, I didn't see anything. I swear it! Will you make some noise when you roam around? I'm a ghost. How am I supposed to do that? From now on you are not allowed to burst in whenever you like. Fine. You know, you kind of look different today. Your clothes look a bit tidy too. Did you change your hair as well? What are you talking about? You have the same class with her today, don't you? -I'm right, aren't I? -What are you talking about? I'm going to go. Don't follow me. Why? So you can have nice and cozy class time with that girl? No. You said you're tired, so rest up. And do not go in this room or touch anything without my permission. See you later. Is there anything else I'm forbidden to do? See you later. Bong-pal, let's go to school. -What the heck? You just said goodbye. -When? I never said that. -Aren't you tired of following me? -It's boring alone at home. And I can't stay home when I'm wearing a pretty dress like this. Fine, go ahead. Geez. EVICTION NOTICE I'm going to send you a seperate maintence bill. Just know that. Understood? Yes. Cheon-sang! Hold it in! Hold it in! Seriously, what are we going to do now? How am I supposed to know? -What?! -Ghost! What is it?! -Why are you in such a good mood? -Just because. Don't I look like a college student in this dress? Oh please. Oh, it's Kyung-ja. Who? Bong-pal, there's someone I need to talk to. Hey, who are you meeting-- I swear... Kyung-ja! - Hyun-ji! - What brings you here? I told you last time that my honey is at this school. Hey, your clothes... -How do I look? -What do you think? You look totally pretty. You were pretty with your uniform on, but you look even prettier in this dress. You're up there in the ranks of Jeon Ji-hyun and Song Hye-gyo. Kyung-ja! You would look perfect with a pair of high heels on. But who burned this dress for you? Was it that blood sausage? I'm right, aren't I? What the heck? He kissed you last time and now he burned this dress for you? I think he likes you. That doesn't make sense. Oh my, why not? I'm a ghost and I've feelings for a human. There's no rule that a human can't have feelings for a ghost. It's not true. I had to beg him to burn this dress for me. And Bong-pal likes someone else. You don't know because you haven't been in a relationship with a guy before. My instincts tell me that he likes you 100 percent. No, there's no way. Who did you see? Just a ghost that I know. My instincts tell me that he likes you 100 percent. -What's up? Why are you smilingt? -It's nothing. Bong-pal. Hello. -You're here early. -Yes. -Let's prepare for class. -Okay. I knew it. How pretty. I'll take that. It's fine. Thanks. No, I'll do it. Oh my, it's Superman. It's written all over your face that you like her. There's no point if you can' talk to her properly. Ah, I'm sorry. No, it's okay. There's no need to be embarrassed. You guys are here early. -Hello. -Hello. Thank you for coming out this early to help me. -Are those materials for today's class? -Yes. Did you get hurt? Those scratches... Ah, it's no big deal. -That looks painful. -Goodness. I didn't bring the materials for class. -Bong-pal. -Yeah? It seemed like that professor avoided me earlier. You're being ridiculous. Did I see wrong? Why aren't these seniors -responding to my text? -Who? You mean that comedic duo? They looked penniless to me. There's no way they're paying you. Please leave a message after the beep. Seriously, these guys! -What is this? -What do you think it is? They ran away. How can you say that right now? If I don't get paid, then you have no means to pay off your debt. What? How dare they run away with our money! Hey, call them again. Hurry! Seriously. Facility maintenance fee is 892,000 won. You have until the 23rd to pay the office. -What is it? -Maintenence bill of 892,000 won. PARK BONG-PAL -What does he want? -Exorcism fee of one million won. -He's really horrible. -Hey, don't! 892,000 won... How are we going to secure all this money? I'm having a tough time as it is just with the camera monthly payments. It's not like I can call my parents. -You really have nothing? -I really have nothing. Ask someone who has money. I've spent all of mine. Then call someone and borrow it. Are you just going to sit and do nothing? All right! Okay! I'm the big brother here! -Hello? -In-rang, I'm completely broke. I'm in a dire situation and need to borrow money. -I'm all you got? -You're all I got. You're the only close friend that I have. Hyun-joo! Hey, Seo-yeon. I didn't see you in class today. I just had some business to take care of. Why do you ask? We recieved some materials to take home from class today. Just a moment. -Hello, Professor. -Hello. Nabi. Nabi, where are you? Hyun-joo! This belongs to Professor Joo. What are you doing? Are you going to eat lunch? Do you only ever think about eating? -What is this? -What do you think it is? You want me to tutor you. I need to know what your skill level is so I can plan accordingly. Okay, you have one hour. Right now? I have a bit of a headache today. Have you no intention of crossing over? You said you need to take the SAT in order to cross over. Yeah, but not now. You have one hour. -Ready... begin. -Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Number four? Number two! Just skip it if you don't know. I'm going to solve all of it! Hey... What's the minimum SAT score for you to cross over? I would need a good enough score to come here in order for me to cross over to the afterlife without any problems. Looks like you don't have a chance of crossing over this year. -32 percent? -Yes, 32 percent. At this rate, you won't even get near the gates to the afterlife. How do you expect to take the SAT with these scores? It's my first exam in five years! Five years or 10 years. This exam is not that hard. A junior high kid would do better than you. So what? Are you bragging about how smart you are right now? I'm done! You're the one who failed. How dare you take your anger out on me? It's not like that! I didn't sleep well yesterday, so I'm not feeling that good. -Then take it again. -What? Take what again? I'm very busy, okay? Professor. Oh, Miss Seo-yeon. What brings you here? I have something to give you. Here. I think this belongs to you. Ah, you're right. Thank you, but how do you have this? It wasn't me. A student in our class picked it up. -Who? -Her name is Noh Hyun-joo. Noh Hyun-joo. The student who missed class today? -Yes. -I see. Anyway, this is great. -I was looking for it. Thank you. -Not at all. -You must be busy, so I'll be on my way. -Sure. By the way, is the dog okay? Yes, thanks to you. -Call me anytime if you need anything. -Yes, thank you. Okay, take care. Take it easy, you quack. How can you make a living when you do it so painfully like this? I'm better than you, punk. Give me your hand. Ouch, be gentle! Goodness, your pulse is so weak. I can barely feel it. -You're hopeless. -Your skills are hopeless, punk. Come on! I'm surprised you're still alive after all those encounters. Does Bong-pal know that you're in this state because of him? What for? It's not nice to talk about. Don't you dare talk about this to Bong-pal. And stop saying I'm in bad condition. I'm totally fine. Outwardly you look fine, but you're a complete mess inside. Make sure you take it easy for the time being. Have you been to that place where Bong-pal's father resides? I hear he left a long time ago. Goodness, it would be nice if he told me where he's going ahead of time. That man is chasing that punk, isn't he? The evil spirit that killed his wife. It seems that way. Gosh, it's been over 10 years. There wasn't anything special in his room except for that picture. Gosh, why was he in such a hurry? He even forgot to send the letter he wrote to his son. And I hear someone else came looking for him besides me. Who? The owner couldn't get a good look at his face. She said he was just a young and handsome fellow. -A young and handsome fellow? -Yes. Ouch! Hey! I don't think I can accept this. What? Why not? I bought this two months ago and there's still two years left of the AS period. It looks like you forced it on here. The AS is difficult if you personally install it like this. It's better to buy a new one than fix it. No, I don't think so. We never touched it... It was you, wasn't it? You're the one who messed around with it. Didn't I tell you not to touch it and that we won't get the AS if it breaks? I didn't do it. You know how I bought this, don't you? I do. I know you bought it with your room and board money. Right. I still have ten months of payments left and I lied to my family. -You did. -And? Well, I didn't... I didn't do it. It was these guys. They did it. Hey, what's wrong? No! No, don't do it... He scares the crap out of me whenever he's like that. Damn it. Hey, In-rang! In-rang! Shoo! Shoo! -Lunch is on me. -Go away! In-rang, don't be angry anymore. Should we order a bottle of soju? Don't even think about it! Soju, my butt. We're broke and we have no money for soju. Take out everything you have. You wanted to buy soju with this? There's barely enough there to pay for our meals and you wanted to buy soju? Where are we going to sleep? -What about you? -I'm going home. -Then what about me? -You can come with me. Your grandmother hates me. No, she despises me. In-rang, why are you in such a hurry? I'm in a hurry because we have to find a place to sleep. Are you abandoning me? Wait for me! I have to read all of this? You have to read all of this and more. This is just the beginning. There's so much you have to study for. Okay, what do you want to do first? Math first. FUNDAMENTALS OF MATHEMATICS Not this one. -How about we start with Korean first? -Let's start with math first. -Why ask then? -I can hear you. Sit up straight. Okay. Let's see here. My stomach is killing me all of a sudden. I need to go to the bathroom. Ghosts don't need to go to the bathroom. Ah, my head hurts so much. Hold on. Stop stalling. You're the one who wanted to study. -Let's do it properly. -Okay. This is easy enough. Go ahead and solve it. So, if the limit is A to B for this equation, then GX equals B. Then GX... Are you sleeping? She didn't solve a single problem. Hey, Kim Hyun-ji. Hey. Whoa. Let's just pick a random place. How far are we going to walk? This place is willing to give us 50 percent off. We have no choice! We're almost there. It's over there! Over there, over there! That's the place. Here you go. Goodness, why do you have so much baggage? I'll keep it in storage without charging extra. Just rest comfortably. -Thank you! -Thank you so much! -These... -Sure, let me take that. Oh my goodness. -This too. -This as well? Sure. -Please rest up. -Thank you. The owner is friendly and the place is very nice. But why is there no one here? That's good for us. It's all ours. -Let's go break a sweat! -Sounds good. Sounds good. I'm melting. Hot, hot. It's very hot. Cheon-sang, how long are we going to stay here? Well, it's about tomorrow, isn't it? Think about it tomorrow. Okay. -Let's sleep. -Let's do that. Let's think about it tomorrow. I wasn't expecting a text from anybody. Seniors, if this is how you handle things, we may have a problem. -It's from Bong-pal. -Of course it's from him. -What did he say? -He is asking for money. Wow, he won't give up, will he? He's consistent, seriously. What should we do? Give it to me. -I don't know. Let's sleep. -I mean... Then I will sleep too. I don't know either. In-rang! PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR TIGHTLY In-rang! What is it? What? Is this locked? It's now open. What was that about? What is it?! My neck hurts... -Are you up? -Yes. By the way, why was I sleeping here? What do you mean? You fell asleep there. Did I do that? Gosh, why didn't you wake me up? I tried, but you wouldn't wake up. Then you should've moved me to the sofa at least. How could you let a woman sleep like this? You're very heavy. I won't throw my back out because of you. Gosh. Gosh! He's such a jerk! Wait, it's open. Bong-pal told me not to go in... Wow, why is there so much stuff in here? Hong Myeong-hee? Who could that be? Wow, these shoes may fit me perfectly. -Hey, what are you doing in here? -Bong-pal. Whose shoes are these? Can you burn them for me? I told you not to come in here. Who said you could touch the stuff in here? - Well, I was just... - You! You're a ghost. So stop acting like a human. Why is he all mad like that? What did I do that was so wrong? Oh my goodness... Here. Are you okay? Gosh, I keep seeing ghosts. Is that because I'm cursed this year? Cheon-sang, take a look at this. There was a reason why that place was cheap. This man died in there a month ago. That place was known to be haunted. -You took me to such a place, huh? -I didn't know that. Anyway, they performed a very expensive exorcism there and all. Gosh, even if you perform an exorcism, ghosts will still come. They wasted the money. They should've just given it to us. I agree. Let's find an empty classroom to sleep in. Are you that sleepy? Yes. Gosh, the phone is still switched off? Seriously, guys... -What is it? -It's Bong-pal. Seniors! Senior In-rang! It's not that we're trying not to pay you. -It may take a little bit of time. -For how long? -Two months. -Why you... -Two days! -That's right, two days. How are we supposed to come up with money like that in two days? Just be quiet. We can pay you back in two days. -How? -It's a secret. How? I'm saying it's a secret. Gosh, she might not have had lunch yet. Gosh, I'm hungry. Bong-pal must be having lunch by now. Should I go over to the school? You are a ghost. So stop acting like a human. I already know that I'm a ghost. Did we really have to dress up like this? If we're going to do it, we should do it right. Let's go! TEMPORARILY CLOSED Are you having a hard time because of a ghost? Even if there was an exorcism, it wasn't helpful? We will... take care of your problem. Ah, it's Bong-pal. Why didn't you turn the light on? Why are you sitting in the dark? So what if it's dark? I'm just a ghost, not a human. -Aren't you hungry? -So what? Will I starve to death when I'm only a ghost? Why does this pork belly look so good? Should I make bulgogi with this meat? It will be so good... Wow, I'm full. I will do the dishes tomorrow. I knew it. Take a look at this. Gosh. The sale volume is definitely low compared to his previous clinic. Wasn't his clinic in the Gangnam area? That's correct. We were very busy then. It's like a paradise here. Then why did he start this clinic all of a sudden? It isn't doing well in this area. I agree. He sold the clinic all of a sudden and came here. He suddenly accepted the offer to become a professor. Either way, he's so cool, so I like it here. Come on. Hurry up. Good work, ladies. Are you going somewhere, sir? Yes, I need to go. -Wrap things up and go home. -We will. Thank you. -See you tomorrow. -I'll go first. Hello? Now? Yum, I enjoyed the meal. Yeah, I'm full. -I'm off. -Are you? To where? To meet my seniors. -Ah, they will pay you? -Yes. -Shall I come with you? -Whatever. Shall we have something to drink first before we begin? Here. Here you go. -Bong-pal, drink. -No thanks. You're not going to pay me in cash. If I destroy the ghost there... You will take 1.5 million from the reward money. It's like a win-win situation. Three million! Stay seated first. Have a seat. Come with me quickly. Come with me. What are you doing? I just wanted to taste it. I've been curious about the taste. Put it down, will you? You can't drink alcohol when you're not old enough. Fine. Hey! We were promised four million for the job. If we give him three, we lose money. Plus, the expenses to fix the room and camera. Then what are you going to tell the owner of the sauna, huh? Will you catch the ghost yourself? Do you want me to die? Do you want me to get ripped to pieces? That's what I was saying... So three? Hey. So... -So let's make a deal of three million. -Come on. Let's go with 3.5 million. -We'll suffer a big loss. -I agree. Done. What exactly is the job? So the job is... You said you'd work tomorrow. Today we're doing a spot inspection only. We want to be prepared for tomorrow and all... Then... is he the exorcist? He's not old enough and just look at the way he's dressed. Are you a student? He's not the exorcist. He's our cute office assistant. He wanted to see how our jobs are done. So we brought him with us today. -Didn't we, Pal? -Sure. Then look around and give me a call. Please take care of it. We will, sir. Trust us and let us handle it. Should we have him fitted for a tuxedo too? It doesn't matter how he dresses. It's good as long as he can catch ghosts, right? I agree. -He's not in there? -No, he isn't. Where did she go? -I'm here. -Me too. Never mind. Did someone die in here? He was a man in his fifties. According to the owner, he was a regular. He might have been a lowlife scumbag. You know, those who try to grab women and such. They try to touch... You know, a pervert. What's going on? Hey, where are you going? -Are you okay? -I'm okay. There is a ghost. That bastard... -He's strong. -Bong-pal! Why is he circling around? His chest! Attack his chest! What took you so long? Is it over? Good work. Hello? Can you hear me? Cheer up, baby Cheer up, baby Cheer up a bit Bong-pal, watch this, okay? It's rare to see a drunken ghost. Hey, Kim Hyun-ji. You're drunk. I'm not drunk. See? I'm perfectly fine. My Bong-pal... Why are you so ugly, huh? You're so ugly. What do you mean you're not drunk? You can't even stand straight. What? Who can't? Me? No way. I can walk just fine like this. Watch me, okay? Watch me. I can walk from here to there. I walk just fine, right? I can go places even better now. Watch me. See? It hurts. I knew it. What are you doing? Get up. Bong-pal, I'm hurt. -Get up so we can go home. -I'm not going. I'm not going home. -Fine then. Stay here all night. -Fine, you bastard. I will live here from now on. I will spend the night here. Hey, you... You... You can't do this to me. Come here so I can hit you. You ducked? Don't you dare move. Why are you doing this? You sure are doing a lot of things. What kind of ghost is an obnoxious drunk? Why not? A ghost shouldn't even be an obnoxious drunk? A ghost shouldn't want to put on pretty clothes either? A ghost shouldn't do things like a human? When I'm only a ghost. When I'm only a ghost... Don't say that anymore. Did I... Did I die because I wanted to? I don't know why I died. I don't even know how I died. I don't like being a ghost. I don't want to be a ghost. I... I didn't become one because I wanted to. Ghost can have their feelings hurt, okay? You're a bastard. Darn it. I don't even know what I'm doing. -Bong-pal! -Hey. Hey! Oh my, you're so pretty. Gosh, why is a ghost so heavy? What? How can I be heavy? I'm so light. I must be light. I'm as light as a feather. Let's go now. Noh Hyun-joo. Who's there? Professor Joo. You're getting home late. What brings you here? I have something to ask. What is it? Where did you find this? Wow, this neighborhood is very quiet. Not many people are here. The best way to have Bong-pal join our club. -Blood Sausage Soup! -I have no idea what you're saying. -Do you want to do it with me? -I'd love to. In front of her, you even blush and smile. You know the thumping noise. I finally walked up there... -I'm running away. -From whom? -Master Bong Pal? -He's very well known in the field. Bong-pal. Where do your parents live? -Have you talked to your father recently? -Why do you ask that? Where has he been to get mud on his shoes? -Hyun Ji. -Yes? Subtitle translation by: Hye Young Beom
