 I can see ghosts. No matter what happens, I'll protect you. Why is my father here? It appears that your dad was murdered. You killed Bong-pal's mother. It wasn't enough, so you killed his father. You've met his father before? At a temple five years ago. He asked me to give something to his son. He also asked me not to show it to anyone. That is very important to Bong-pal. I'm leaving tomorrow. I will come back soon.

 Wait for me, Bong-pal. You don't look so good. Have some tea. Monk Myung-cheol. EPIDOSE 15 Did you know about it, by any chance? What do you mean? The detective came by. He asked me about Prof. Joo. He said... that Prof. Joo Hye-sung is connected to my father's death. Bong-pal. Prof. Joo Hye-sung is not human. Accurately speaking, an evil spirit is inside his body. An evil spirit.

 The same one that came out of your body before. What's wrong? No, I just feel dizzy. I will use the bathroom. That evil spirit has been hanging around you and Hyun-ji. -Hyun-ji? -She has what he wants. -What is it? -A weapon. It was used to get rid of that evil spirit in your body. Do you remember? That weapon... ...was broken. It was. But it seems like your mother made another one for your sake. Bong-pal, your mother had a very strong soul. So much so that it shocked even the shamanesses. -My mom? -Yes. Some say it was a gift, but to your mother, it was a nightmare. She decided not to accept the gift. -Why? -She was pregnant with you back then. She wanted to raise you like a normal person. The gods were angry. Among them, the evil spirit was also there. -It was rejected, so... -It tried to posess my body. Yes. That's when the misfortune started. I eventually got rid of the evil spirit from your body but your mother made another weapon just in case it tried to harm you again. -With all her energy. -My mom. But... how did Hyun-ji... Your father came looking for that weapon at the temple and it seemed like Hyun-ji also came to pray. Your father was being chased by the evil spirit at that time. He was frantic and asked her to look after the weapon. But she got into a car accident on her way to give it to you. The weapon got lost in the middle and your father was back to being chased again. My mom, my father, and Hyun-ji. -They all got hurt because of me. -No. No, Bong-pal. It's not because of you. It's because of that evil spirit. Where are you going? I need to go to Hyun-ji. MY LOVE BONG BONG The person you are trying to call cannot be reached... Hyun-ji. Are you okay? Hyun-ji. Where is the item you're supposed to give me? Young lady. Prof. Joo, you're... You remember. It's best to bury bad memories. Excuse me! What brings you here? -Is Hyun-ji home? -She's not home right now. -Didn't she go out to meet you? -She hasn't returned yet? Is there something going on? No. Young man! Young man! -Never mind. -Seriously! It's not him. You need to move more quickly. You're not careful at all. Don't you know the basic of a stakeout? Is this necessary, huh? What are we? Detectives? Didn't the monk tell us to watch over him? And when did you ever listen so well? You know, you're not as bright as I thought you were. We need to score points with the monk if we want to work with Bong-pal. Why do you think he asked us to do? It's because this person is dangerous to Bong-pal! He must've seen us as very strong and reliable colleagues to give us something so important like this to take on. -Ah. -Ah? I get it. Isn't that him? Right? He's... he's loading something in the car. Let's follow him. Let's go. Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji. Right, the alarm went off 30 minutes ago. We started the search and rescue. We'll catch him soon. Don't worry so much. I'll call you right away if something comes up, so go home. Bong-pal! Bong-pal! Goodness, hello. What's going on here? That bastard... ...took Hyun-ji. Goodness. Avalokitesvara. Oh goodness. Is your daughter Kim Hyun-ji? She is currently missing. -Are you okay? -Are you okay? Sir. Did you talk to the employees? Yes, I think he planned this all along. He gave them time off a few days ago. And they know nothing about Prof. Joo. His cell phone is also turned off. It'll be hard to track him. What should we do? Compare Park Ji-hun's and Prof. Joo Hye-sung's DNA. Tell everyone this is an emergency. -He hasn't gone too far. -Yes, sir. Who went to his mother's house? The local precinct agreed to cooperate. They're probably there by now. Hey, be quiet. -What in the world is he doing? -I don't know. He seems very suspicious. Seeing how he's changing cars this late at night. It's always the good-looking ones that surprise you. He's taking something out. Hyun... Hyun-ji! What are you doing over there? Nothing. Is this your car? Yes. Why do you ask? You can't park here for two days without a contact number. Hurry up and remove it. I got so many complaints because of this car. -Just go. -Hurry up and remove it. Excuse me. Yes? I told you to just go. Why do you keep bothering me? -What the heck? -What are you doing? Let's go! What the hell! This worthless piece of crap! Bong-pal, don't worry so much. That punk won't be able to touch Hyun-ji until he finds the weapon. Why... ...is he so obsessed with it? He can completely possess you once it disappears. Me? It's because your mother's energy has been handed down to you. That's why he's been lurking around you for ten years. Yes, In-rang. What? Where? Okay. Sir, that camera is useless. It's been broken for a long time. The students did not get a good look at the license plate. Tracking him won't be easy. If he planned this as well, then he probably has an escape location too. Call all of Prof. Joo's contacts and check all the streets and cameras. Yes, sir. Bong-pal. Let's go back home. You guys too. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. -Bong-pal. -Go without me. What about you? I have to find Hyun-ji. By what means? How are you going to find her? I can't sit around and do nothing. He's after you. You're the one who is in danger. Then what about Hyun-ji? -I'll find her. -This happened because of me. -I have to do something. -Bong-pal. We'll stay with Bong-pal. Don't worry. JOO HYE-SUNG KIM HYUN-JI -Sir. -Yeah? -Did you find something? -Yes, I checked the cameras and there were several shots captured of Prof. Joo's car. We're in the process of searching for it right now. We should be able to get its location in a couple of hours. -Let me know as soon as possible. -Yes, sir. Hello. Monk, you can't stay here. Go over there and we'll let you know if we get any information. -She's here. -Hello. Please sit over here. Just a moment please. Who is that person? Prof. Joo Hye-sung's mother. Let's go. Did Hye-sung kill all those people? We're still investigating. It's true. I heard what happened on the way. How... I know this is very difficult for you but please help us to speed up. I'm not sure if I can be of any help to you. What was the last thing you talked about with your son? I don't know. I understand. -In-rang. -Yeah? Did you say Prof. Joo headed to the right? Yes, he went to the right. He is looking for the item that Hyun-ji has. And Hyun-ji got into a car accident trying to give me that item. Then that item is probably in Seoul. That's right. Why did he come here then? I think he's trying to lure us. He probably went to Seoul. -You fixed it? -That's right. Who am I? We can use this for ten more years. What should we do? Where do we go? Should we just go to Seoul? The detectives said that he was prepared to run away, right? Yeah, why? -Don't you think he scoped out the area? -Probably. Then... Hey, where are you going? Hey. What are you doing? Are you searching for the destination? I'm sure he already erased it. You're slowly turning into an idiot. Of course he erased it. It can be deleted from the screen, but it's still on the hard drive. If I do this right, I can even find out where he went a week ago. What? It worked! I found it! I found it! -Is that a phone number? -Coordinates. It's the longitude and latitude. If I input the coordinates here... Ta-da. Just who are you? Bong-pal, come quickly! These are the current destinations. That's the school and that's the hospital. Where is that? I think this is Guil-dong. I'll look for it. Ah, Guil-dong is where that empty warehouse is! It's a great place for bad guys to hide. Do you think Hyun-ji is there? Let's go for now. Thank you. I'm sorry that I couldn't help you. Not at all. I'm thankful that you even came. I'll escort you home. No. I'll just go by myself. Are you okay? -Yes. -Can we talk? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have nothing to say. No, it's fine. I'm not doing this for your apology. Then... There are some questions I want to ask about your son. I told the detective everything. I won't know anything even if you ask me. You can tell me what you couldn't say to the detective. When did it start? When did your son change? I know there is an evil spirit inside your son's body. When did it start? Hye-sung is who he is... ...because of me. You brat! You're just like your mother! I told you not to look at me like that! -Don't look at me like that, punk! -Hye-sung, run! Stop! Please stop! Why are you crying? Should I help? Leave me alone! Go away! Go away! Should I save you from hell? How about it? You have to save your mom too. Don't you think so? Mom? Mom. Kill him, kill him, kill him! Kill him! Hye-sung... Hye-sung! Someone help! Someone has fallen! I should've taken better care of him. He wouldn't be what he is now if I had done that. I'm home. Mom. Mom. Mom! -Can you give me the number and address? -Gosh, it's really hot today. Why are there so many reports on a hot day like this? -Yes, I understand. -So many reports. No kidding. By the way, who is that kid? He came back from school and his mom moved without him. -Did you call her? -I did. She's coming. Ever since that day, Hye-sung started to change. He went to live in the dorms at his middle school. And he only called me once in a while. It's all my fault. I made him that way. I'm to blame. It's for one day. Why did Mom pack this much? It will be hard to carry this around. Now you're up. I've been waiting for so long. Why are you doing this? If you have your memory back, you would know. Don't blame me. You should blame the man who gave you the item and his son. They put you in hell for the last five years. If you hadn't gotten that item we wouldn't have met this way. Don't you think so? Are you scared of me? No. I'm not scared of you at all. Good. Do you know what's scarier than just feeling scared? It's being found out that you're actually scared. See? You're already shaking. What are you? You're not human, are you? Not sure. What am I? Am I human or not? Depending on your answer I will be human or not. Where is... ...that item? That is very important to Bong-pal. If you remember, please tell me, okay? What is it? You still don't remember? Then I will help you remember. Hello? -Mom. -Is this Hyun-ji? Hyun-ji! -Mom! -Hello? Hyun-ji! What do you think? Do you remember now? You'd better remember. If not, your loved ones will die one by one. Here! Hyun-ji. Hyun-ji! -Hyun-ji! -Kim Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Kim Hyun-ji! MYEONGSEONG UNIVERSITY STATION As a boy, he probably wanted to protect himself from the guilt from killing his dad and feeling distant from his mom. His hatred made the evil sprit come to him. The spirit used the boy's open wound. Do you think that professor might still have his humanity? Not at all. They're one body now. Then what should we do now? -Where is the stuff I gave you? -Ah, hold on. If I think about how hard it was to make this all the way out here... Wow, it's great work. Thank you. I really hope this has the power of divine spirits. When you're not equipped to borrow the power of divine spirits you won't be able to walk. Do you want to be crippled? Your nagging is getting worse. That means it's time for me to go. What is it that you're going to do? I have to finish what I couldn't 18 years ago. What? I will finish him. How are you going to do that without weapons? -Only you will end up dead. -I will have the power of divine spirits. If I don't finish him, Bong-pal will be in danger. Bye now. I hope you get married again. I will go now. You'd better not do anything stupid if you care about your mother. Get out. Bong-pal. Is it true that the man is here? Yes. -Did you call the police? -They should be on their way. Bong-pal, I will go in by myself. -You stay out here. -No, I won't. It happened because of me. I will finish it. You two stay here. We... Sir. The subway has stopped running. Sir, I said we're closed. Please leave. There are buses outside. Take the bus. It hasn't been that long since he was here. Bong-pal! Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Kim Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Bong-pal. -You didn't see her? -No. If she's nowhere to be seen... Is this really the right place? MYEONGSEONG UNIVERSITY STATION Yes. Then maybe she's mistaken about the location since it's been five years. If not, it's a mystery. I can't believe she vanished without a trace. Five years ago? Five years... If it happened five years ago, we're at the wrong place. If Hyun-ji came here five years ago, this wasn't the same station then. What do you mean this wasn't the same station? It means that there was a fire five years ago. They closed the station then and rebuilt this station instead. He's right. There was a fire... -Then where is the original location? -It's that... It may be near Exit Two. This feels very spooky. Wait. We should wait for the police. -That's right. -Isn't it? True. You're right. Bong-pal. Be careful. You too. You're no longer needed. I will let you rest now. Hyun-ji! I was going to come find you. Thank you for coming to me first. Do you know how long I've been waiting for this moment? If I hadn't been driven out of your body... this wouldn't have happened. Wait a little bit. You and I will become one body. No, you can't! You evil spirit, you're up to no good! Bong-pal, Hyun-ji. Are you two okay? Hyun-ji, get Bong-pal out of here. Hurry! I won't let you do that. Will you really kill me? Then you're killing this man too. It means that you're taking a life. Sure. If I can end you, I shall do that. Don't kill yourself over this. I will end you today, you evil spirit. You bastard! This is why I told you not to kill yourself over this. Now this is really over! You bastard! Monk Myung-cheol. Are you okay? Hyun-ji. The weapon... the weapon... Monk Myung-cheol. It's done. It's done. It's done. Bong-pal. Bong-pal! Hyun-ji, find the weapon! It's the only thing that will stop him. Monk Myung-cheol! Is Hyun-ji leaving? Why do you exorcise, Monk Myung-cheol? Do you know why I was against you exorcising when I found out? It was because I could see hatred in your eyes then. -You remember these people, right? -I killed them. You can't see the world right when you have so much anger in you. She may be a con artist. Not all ghosts are bad. Perhaps they just want your sympathy. I said get lost! Can you really do the job? It's up to you. Isn't this place a restaurant? I'm Goo Dae Hyung, a sophomore in the Physical Education department. Making others happy makes you happiest. MY LOVE BONG BONG Hello, seniors. I'm a freshman, Kim Hyun-ji. I'd appreciate your guidance. Subtitle translation by
