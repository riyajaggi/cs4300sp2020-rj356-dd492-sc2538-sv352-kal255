 I like you. I don't care what others think about us. I like you just the way you are, Hyun-ji. EPISODE 10 What brings you here, sir? Professor Joo Hye-sung? Yes, that's me. Do you know Bong-pal? Park Bong-pal. -Yes. -Ah. He is a son figure to me. I heard his professor works here. I just wanted to stop by to say hello.

 Oh, I see. It's nice to meet you. You seem very familiar. Have we ever met before? Well, we probably met each other around the neighborhood. I don't think so. It was long ago. I'm not sure. -I don't remember. -I see. Hello. -We got your lunch. -Okay. You can start first. Oh, it's lunchtime. Sorry for wasting your time. -Not at all. -Please enjoy your lunch. Please take good care of Bong-pal. Sure.

 Excuse me. Sir. -I'll see you next time. -See you. -Then I can eat soybean paste sauce. -Eat slowly. Don't worry about anything. Got it? Sir? I guess he's not here. It seems so. What... What was he watching? Bong-pal, is this you? So cute! When was it? That was my middle school graduation. Why was he watching this all of a sudden? He kept mentioning my graduation earlier. Hmm. -Come on, let's watch a little more. -There's nothing to watch. Forget it. -I want to know more of your childhood. -Forget it. Let's watch it next time. When would it be? Next time. Who recorded it anyways? It was... my father. He used to work as a producer a long time ago. He must have recorded this and that for fun. Did your father record all those videos in that room, too? Yes. -What did he film? -I don't know. Random stuff, I guess. I've never watched them. I was wondering... why you don't live with your dad? It just... happened to be that way. -I'm going to wash up. -Okay. There's something suspicious about that punk. -Is it good? -I'm so into it. Come here. -Should we go inside? -No, it's not cold at all. Oh my goodness. Why it's not turning off? -I'm going to bed. -Oh, okay. Good night. Why isn't it turning on? It's not working. What's wrong with the lights? There you go. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... Who are you? Where is the manager? What brings you here instead of him? I... saw something. -I think it was a ghost. -A ghost, you say? Ghost... G... G... A ghost, you say? Wait a minute. He got bags under his eyes. Okay, give me your right hand. It's okay. His pulse is so weak. You're able to see ghosts because there's darkness surrounding you! We can shine light upon you. Then... what should I do? We'll take care of everything. Sir, you just need to... prepare cash. Go straight. Yes, that way. Turn right. Hey, Bong-pal. The ghost has been seen all over the school. But then... the way it looks is very peculiar. Is this the right place? Bong-pal. Do you see something? It's not here. I think it left already. -No. -What about you? Do you see anything? I don't feel anything ghostly. Ouch. -What is that? -Ah! -Oh my god! -It's here! It's here! It's here! Wait for me! What is it? Huh? -Something is strange. -Yeah. -What the heck! -Get it! Bong-pal, we caught the ghost! We caught the ghost! -I'm not afraid of ghosts! -I'm not a ghost, I'm a human! -Oh, you are? -Hold on! Hold on! Isn't he Hyun-gyu? It's you, right? You know him? Let go! Let go of me! Hyun-gyu. What... are they? Germanium gemstones. Germanium relieves pain and helps oxygen supply. It also strengthens your immunity. This bracelet is made from germanium. Don't take it, okay? I've counted all of them. What happened to you, Hyun-gyu? That's the way life is. Hey, that guy earlier. He must've been hiding in the school pretty long. Yes, it seems. I guess... he had a hard time getting a job. I heard he was a genius when he was a student here. Who knew he would end up selling germanium? He's being chased by debt collectors because of it. What is this? Why are you carrying this? Oh no, don't say that you accepted this in return for the exorcism. Bong-pal, you caught on real quick! You know, I've talked to that guy. According to him, this jade mat is made from natural germanium gemstones. It helps oxygen supply, enhances immunity, relieves pain... And boosts endorphin release. I can't stop laughing since I put this bracelet on. Hey, Bong-pal. This is germanium. Here, try it on. You keep the healthy stuff. I want money. I need to leave for a class. Why did you accept this? He has no money! What was I supposed to do? Oh, dude! -How about we give this to your grandma? -My grand... Geez. What's this? What is this? Are these mosquito bites? What... Hold on. There's nothing special. The alcohol level has been confirmed from his blood. His skull, collarbone, and femur broke from the fall. The dent in his skull is the immediate cause of the death. -That's it. -I see. He killed the one he loved and then himself because of the guilty feelings. -Just like a well-plotted novel, huh? -Let's not go that far. It's just a crime of passion and suicide. Hi, Chief. Yes. It's not under your jurisdiction. Why're you so interested? Someone is making me interested in it. Who is that? The professor you said? -Yes. -Sir. The chief wants the report on the Uyeon-dong case as soon as possible. -You should leave. You must be busy. -Alright, thank you. -Are you heading to the office? -You have the address -of Professor Joo's mother, right? -Yes. Why are you asking? You're thinking -of going there now? -Get in. The chief will go nuts if he finds out. You can go to the office. I don't care. Let's go, sir. No! Dad, where are you? He's at it again! When are you coming? Come quickly! Mom's not home either! Dad, hurry up. Okay? Hyeon-min! Hey... You're injured! Oh no! Hyeon-min! Hey, stay with me! -Hyeon-min! -Go away! Hey... what's wrong? Please stop. I'm scared. Hyeon-min... Please... Hyeon-min! Woo-woo-woo, be pretty! -What are you doing? -Don't do it! No! "Hyun-ji, I don't know when we'll ever meet again..." Dude! Seriously? Now you're writing a love letter? It's going to get wrinkled! -Are you okay? -Did you just hit me? You shouldn't have taken it away from me in the first place. Did you just hit me because of a ghost? I didn't mean it. Let me see. Are you okay? My eyes. Hold on. -I can't see. -You sure? I can't see anything. I can't see. I can't.... Cheong! Shim Cheong, where are-- -You can see. -Guess you're right. You know what? I'll go check with my doctor. -Be ready to pay for that. -As you wish. Hi, this is Choi Cheon-sang from Blood Sausage Soup, your 24-hour exorcism service. How may I help you? NOTICE: CLASS IS CANCELLED DUE TO PROF. JOO'S PERSONAL MATTER Professor, there's no lecture today. Are you okay? -There's no lecture today. -Perfect! Let's go for a picnic! -All you want to do is having fun. -Phooey! I study hard, too. CHEON-SANG Hello, ma'am. Are you Professor Joo's mother? Thank you, ma'am. Detective, I wonder what brings you here all the way from Seoul? Ma'am, I apologize for a sudden visit. We came to ask you a question. -Is it about Hye-sung? -Yes. Has your son come to visit you recently? He does visit from time to time. Do you remember when was it? -Excuse me? -The date your son came to visit you. Do you remember the date by any chance? Well... I don't remember the exact date. -What's the matter? -Sir. Over there. You came all the way down here. Did you get what you were looking for? Well, you can ask your mother directly. Excuse us. Thank you, ma'am. My brother hasn't returned. My parents are looking for him. It's been over an hour already. Su-gyeong... was looking at me. -You saw a ghost? -Yes. Do you think she's gonna hurt him? Do you have any idea where Hyeon-min would go to? I guess my parents already went there. What about a place Su-gyeong would go to? That place. It can be it. This is where he scattered her ashes. Oh! Over there! Bong-pal, over there! -Cheon-sang, go faster. -I'm already going as fast as I can. Step on it! Try harder! Come on! Step on it! -What the heck? -What's wrong? There's smoke! Damn! I hope it doesn't explode! I'll go first. Who are you? What are you doing? What are you doing? He's the one you loved. Why are you trying to kill him? What are you talking about? Why would I kill Hyeon-min? -I'm trying to save him now! -Su-gyeong. I'll see you soon. No! Hyeon-min. Please don't do this. Su-gyeong. It's a brain tumor. At most, you have three months to live. Oh, well... What about a surgery? It's possible, but... it's far from assured. Well... Ow, that looks dangerous. Who are you? Ah-ah-ah-ah. It hurts. Hey, do you have a death wish? It not like it's the end of the world! It is... for me. Ah, I see. Sorry that I didn't know. Did you think I would say that? Look, I don't know what your story is. But why are you giving up already? You're too young. Nobody knows what may happen. You have to live each day to its fullest. Carpe diem. Don't you know what it means? Who knows? Something good might happen. Be strong, okay? -Be strong. -You can do it! Cheer up! I can do it! Okay, go home safely. Stick to sidewalk, got it? Oh, I have to go! -Can I pay now? -Yes, sure! Ow! You made the right decision. Coffee is much better than alcohol. Here you are. Thank-- Hey, wait! You should take this. That... is for you. Oh, by the way... Oh, hi! -You're here. -Did you wait long? No... well... Actually, I waited for a long time. -Be careful. -I will. Watch out! I'm gonna go on a trip for several days. It won't take long. All right. -Don't take too much time. -When I return... I'll come straight to you. Okay, have a safe trip. Doctor. The surgery will go well, right? -I will do my best. -I... I want to live. -Have a good night. -See you. Oh my, I missed his call. I'm sorry. I might not be able to see you again. That's why I want to tell you the truth. The truth is, I... Su-gyeong, I miss you. Hyeon-min, are you okay? Are you awake? I'll go get Mom and Dad. Are you okay? Can you hear me? Can you answer the phone, please? Hello? What did you say? No... No-- No! No! No! No, Su-gyeong... SIN SU-GYEONG No... I'm sorry, Su-gyeong. If... If I hadn't called you... No, it wasn't your fault. So please don't throw away your life. I just wanted to be with you. Do you know why I went through the surgery? Because I wanted to be with you and live with you. I don't want you to die... and get to be with me. It would make me feel even worse. Su-gyeong, please... I was very happy... while I was with you. Help me to leave with the happy memories. Please. Su-gyeong. Hyeon-min. Promise me that you won't hurt yourself again. You promised, okay? -I love you. -I love you too. I loved you so much. Su-gyeong... Will he be all right? He will be okay. Cheon-sang, I will return the clothes tomorrow. Sure. You did a good job today. Bong-pal, wait a minute. Umm... Can you give this to Hyun-ji for me? Tell her it is from my heart. -In-rang. -Yes? -The thing is... -Mm-hmm. Hyun-ji... ...has someone in mind. What? See you tomorrow. That's a lie. You idiot! Why? Somewhere down the road, we will part company like them. I guess. So what? What matters is that I'm happy now. Worrying about the future won't change anything. Hey, you're the one who told me not to worry. You're right. By the way, In-rang will be okay, right? He will be fine. You should've listened to me from the beginning. -How can you be in love with a ghost? -I know. If I had known it would hurt this much I wouldn't have started. This letter... I wrote this letter for her. What an idiot. I loved you, Kim Hyun-ji! But I don't think I can live like this. I'll go after her. I'll-- -Hyun-ji, I will come see you! -No! -Let go of me! -I can't! -How am I supposed to live without you? -I want to see her. I miss her so much. I really do. I am so heartbroken. Cheon-sang, what should I do? Are you sure it's him? I'm not quite sure. Still, I don't feel good about it. It gave me the creeps when I touched his hand. Even a lousy monk like you felt such an energy. He must be extraordinary. Why are you here anyways? Do you want me to... No way! I can't handle such a thing. It's out of my line. After seeing you went down like that... -Don't even think about it! -My gosh. You're being a chicken. -That's not why I came. -Then what is it? You know the weapon that I used on Bong-pal when he was little. Can I get the same weapon again? -It's broken, isn't it? -That's what I'm saying. It's very rare. Not so easy to find. It will make me feel better if I have it. Can you ask around? -I will. -And... Can you make me a talisman? I want Bong-pal to carry it. Not sure if it will work though. I'm leaving now. Okay. It's getting late. Drive safely. Are you hurt? It's nothing. See you. Honey, who was that? Is he your son? He's very handsome. He's not my son. He is... Is anybody here? Someone fell down! Hye-sung. -What are you doing? -Me? Studying. Why are you studying this early? I have to. I don't have much time until the college entrance exam. -Aren't you going to eat? -Let me finish this first. -Why? -I want you to take it easy. You can't keep up the pace until the end if you burn yourself out now. Oh, no! Don't look. I already saw them. -When? -A while ago. Let me see them. Come on. You drew all over on Seo-yeon's face. What? Stop teasing! Hand them back to me. Gosh, you made her look ugly. -Are you jealous of her? -No way. Why would I? Then what is this? Come on. Stop teasing and just give them back to me. Geez. I can't even take a single photo with you. I don't like photos. I prefer seeing you with my own eyes. It is better to see you in person like this. -You're so ugly. -What did you say? -Say what? -Stop it. -I won't. -I said stop. Hey! -Ouch! -Nyah! Come on! Hey, what now? Ouch! It hurts. -Stop it! -It sounds like Bong-pal. I've never seen him laughing like this. Come on! What are-- -He didn't even lock the door. -I'm really sorry! Hey! Ouch! -You can't keep beating! It's my turn. -Okay, got it. I got it. I'm late. I have a class at 11:30 a.m. -What? What about breakfast then? -Let's eat at school. Bong-pal. Sir. Who were you talking to? Huh? I asked who you were talking to. By any chance... are you with the maiden ghost from last time? -Are you finished? -No, I'll cook more sausage. It's not for you. There is a stray cat around. Bong-pal! Did you get this toothbrush for me? You've been living with that ghost all this time? What should we do? -It's none of your business. -What do you think you're doing? Are you in some kind of romance with a ghost? -I said it's none of your business. -Your mom died because of a ghost. Still, you're with a ghost? Let's fix your vision immediately. I will look into it. Also, stop going around exorcising! -I will take care of it. -I don't think so, punk! -Let's end it right now! -I don't want to! By any chance... do you have feelings for that ghost? Yes, I do. -So please stay out of it. -You punk... Fine. I will stay out of your business. Did your mom die because of a ghost? And you're saving money to fix your vision? -Don't worry about what he said. -So, it's true. I didn't even know. What an idiot I am. Don't worry. Let's go to school. I will stay home today. You go ahead. We still have no idea what had happened to his dad. Seriously! How could he! Let me see. By the lunar calendar, today is... Oh my goodness. It's Bong-pal's birthday today. Why do I care about this stubborn punk who doesn't listen? Bong-pal! Bong-pal! What should I do with this? I can't just leave it here. Let's see. What a mess. He should've cleaned up. I know you're here. Don't leave and hear me out. I don't know why you're stuck here. Leave Bong-pal alone. You don't seem like an evil spirit. Please leave Bong-pal... for his sake. When he was little... he was possessed by an evil spirit. It's all my fault. If only I had been stronger when I fought with it... Sir! -Are you okay? -I... I'm fine. When the evil spirit came out of his body, I couldn't finish it off completely. It is my biggest regret in life. The evil spirit got so angry. And killed Bong-pal's mom right in front of him. I learned that he's able to see ghosts from that moment. Part of the energy from the evil spirit remained and altered him somehow. Since then, he's been suffering from seeing ghosts. He's been an outcast from his peers because of his vision. Do you think a ghost and a human can possibly be together? Please leave Bong-pal for his sake. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BONG-PAL. Do you think a ghost and a human can possibly be together? Please leave Bong-pal for his sake. Hyun-ji. Hyun-ji... HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BONG-PAL. Hyun-ji. Hey, you're back. -Are you okay? -Sure, I'm good. You didn't run into Myung-cheol again, did you? Well... I saw him briefly, but I disappeared on him. -Good. -By the way, it's your birthday today? He came back with a cake. That's right. Why didn't you tell me? I had no idea. Actually, I forgot about it. -I don't really celebrate my birthdays. -Why not? I can't buy you anything. But, is there any place you want to go? Let's celebrate it together today. Wow, it's beautiful. It is. It's my first time on a cruise. I might have been when I was alive, huh? I also haven't been for a while. Is that so? It's really nice to be here with you. Me too. Oh, it's about to start. Let's go see. -It's better to see it here, isn't it? -Yes. -Bong-pal. -Yes? I want you to be happy. I'm happy now. To be honest, I've never celebrated my birthday. I never liked it either. But my birthday isn't that bad because you're here with me. Wow. I'm sorry. For what? -For everything. -There's nothing to be sorry. -I can't do anything for you. -It's fine. -Happy birthday, Bong-pal. -Thank you. Bong-pal, I'm thirsty. Okay. Wait here then. I will go get some drinks. Where did she go? Hyun-ji! Excuse me. Hyun-ji. I'm sorry. Hyun-ji! Kim Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! I'm sorry, Bong-pal. -Hyun-ji. -Let go of me. -Let's go home. -I said let go of me! You think you and I can be together? Being with you makes me feel uncomfortable and lonely. Where is the stuff you're supposed to deliver? I don't know what you're up to. But it's not going to go your way. Bong-pal! Subtitle translation by: Hye Young Beom
