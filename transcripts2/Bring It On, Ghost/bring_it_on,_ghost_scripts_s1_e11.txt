 What, punk? Why did you want to see me this late at night? You bumped into Hyun-ji this afternoon, didn't you? Hyun-ji? -Do you mean the ghost? -Yes. -Did you run into her? -Yes, I did. What did you say to her? -What did you say? -Why are you asking? I'm asking what did you say to her! I told her to leave you. It looks like that ghost must've understood me. -Why did you do that? -Come to your senses, punk. She's a ghost! -I told you to stay out of it! -You punk!

 This is not the time to be messing around with a ghost! Where are you going? I'm gonna go find her. Bong-pal! Bong-pal! That rascal. AVAILABLE ACCIDENT HAZARD What's wrong with this? Hello, I'm Manager Jung from Jungmin Life Insurance. Goodness, you're working hard today. The energy here is not good. A lot of people died here. There have been scores of accidents at this place alone. Everyone says that they saw a ghost. Oh, as you may saw in the report, all the accidents occurred at 2:00 a.m. It looks like he took the bait. There is the famous Jayu-road ghost. Now, drivers got scared to drive here at night. Should I call it Pyeonghwa-road ghost? Ah, I got goosebumps! That's scary! How come no one is answering the phone, huh? I can understand In-rang. But Bong-pal has been ignoring my texts since yesterday! I'm working alone! Huh! If you hadn't interfered, I wouldn't have become like this. Why are you bothering me by leaving something like that behind? You tried to save your son, but... you should've known it can also threaten to kill your husband and your son. Who are you? What time did you leave the house? -I think it was around 12 p.m. -I see, around 12 p.m. And when did you come back? After a cup of tea, I guess it was around 4 p.m. Around 4 p.m. -You came back home around 4 p.m. -Yes. What is the most valuable item that is missing? Probably the jewelry. -Jewelry? -Yes. Just a moment please. We have a similar case. -Give me a second. -Sure. This is similar to the Beomil-dong case. The suspect is detained at the Gangil Police department. We can crack the case quickly if we go through a cross-examination. Okay, sounds good. Sir, what are you up to? -This lady's son is out of town, too. -Correct. Her son is in the States and she's living alone. It's normal to have pictures like this if your son is far away, right? Well... that's normal. Why? -Hye-sung's mother. -You're still hung up on that? What's bothering you this time? She didn't have a single picture of her son. He's handsome with a great personality. Plus, a successful veterinarian to boot. He's the kind of son any mother would be proud of and brag about. But the look on her face when her son came home... That wasn't the look of a mother happy to see her son. What was the cause of death of Professor Joo's father? Just an accident, according to the report. -Which department was in charge? -Gyeongil Department. Why? -Are you gonna go there? -Something is off. I'll go check on something. Go back to the office and dig up around Prof. Joo. Okay, take care. Hyun-ji! Yes! Rock-paper-scissors! Yay! Kim Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Kim Hyun-ji! You got to be kidding me, dumbass! What the hell is wrong with you? Leave me alone. Why didn't you pick up your phone? You're not going to work, huh? It won't go away. -The pain. -You... If you keep acting like this, I'll call the boogeyman! -Huh? -I'm going to kill you! Me... who? The punk who's with Hyun-ji. I don't care if it's a ghost or a man. I'm going to kill him! Gosh! Why don't you just go outside and kill yourself? What is the matter with my bro Bong-pal? PROFESSOR, THERE'S NO LECTURE TODAY. ARE YOU OKAY? Hi. Seo-yeon, why do you have such a worried look? What are you looking at? Are you expecting a call? No, it's nothing. Vacation is around the corner-- Oh, you're graduating, right? Yes, this is my last semester. I would stay longer if I could. I'd like to go back to preschool if I could. I was in the forsythia class. Are you in some kind of romance with a ghost? -I said it's none of your business. -Your mom died because of a ghost. Still, you're with a ghost? Since then, he's been suffering from seeing ghosts. He's been an outcast from his peers because of his vision. Do you think a ghost and a human can possibly be together? Please leave Bong-pal for his sake. To be honest, I've never celebrated my birthday. I can't do anything for you. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. I made the right decision. Sure I did. Hyun-ji. Bong-pal. Hyun-ji. -Let go of me. -Where are you going? -I've been looking all over for you. -I said let go! Is it because of Monk Myung-cheol? I told you to ignore him! -Let's go home. -Let go! It's not because of what the monk said. -I was going to leave you anyway. -What? -Why would you? -You really don't know? You think you and I can be together? -I told you it doesn't matter. -It matters to me. Honestly, I stuck to you because I wanted to be saved. But I forgot for a while... that we live in different worlds. Hyun-ji. The time we spent together doesn't matter to you? How can you leave me so easily? Do you think ghosts can live with humans happily? You're the only one in the world who can see me. I don't want to live such a lonely life even though I'm with you. What I want is to find my memories and be saved. Being with you makes me feel uncomfortable and lonely. Do you... really mean it? Yes... I mean it. -You're not happy with me? -That's right. Fine. Okay. Idiot, why am I crying? I'm the one who left him. These guys are unbelievable. Hurry up! I'm coming. Why should we go to his place? Just call him. He's not picking up his phone! So what? There's no need to go look for him. We can't work without Bong-pal! Then just call it quits. Why go look-- Call it quits? You said you miss Hyun-ji. You can go and see her. How can I see her now? She's already with someone else. As if she was ever with you. Hey, isn't that Bong-pal? Geez. Bong-pal. -Hey. -Man, how much did you drink? You're not a big drinker. What's the matter? By the way, Bong-pal. Is Hyun-ji here with you? She's... not here. -She must be at home then. -No. She left. She left? To where? When does she come back? She will... never come back again. You can't even hold your liquor. Ah-ah-ah! Ow! It hurts! Damn! He can't hold his liquor either. Just stay there! Don't get hurt! Go. Just go. There's no hope for me. Yeah, you're hopeless. We're almost there. Don't ever drink again or I'll kill you. Water! I need water! Come back, Hyun-ji. Don't go, Hyun-ji. -Hyun-ji, please don't go. -Hyun-ji? In... In-rang! In-rang-- Ow! In-rang. Goodness. Am I being punished or what? Your son is going to die this time. Tell me! HANIL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL ANIMAL AND LOVE VOLUNTEERING GROUP Hello, this is Joo Hye-sung. How have you been? Yes, I'm doing well. Professor, do you still work at Hanil University Hospital? Then... can you do me a favor? Okay, I'll make a visit to talk in person. Yes, thank you. Bong-pal! Did he go to school? Bong-pal. Goodness, you reek of alcohol. How much did you drink? What an idiot, seriously! It's just a ghost. Bong-- My goodness. DAEHAN STUDY ESSAY ACADEMY Daehan Study? Eat this. Don't skip a meal and stop drinking too much. Hi, did you find out something? -Go to the temple when you have time. -All of a sudden? Why? The monk there... The one who was with the abbot. -He has something to tell you. -To me? -What would it be? -It concerns Bong-pal's father. -You better go listen to him in detail. -Alright. Okay, thanks. BONG-PAL AND HYUN-JI Hi. Okay. I heard you have something for me in regards to Bong-pal's father. Yes. Few days ago, the shaman told me that you are looking for Park Ji-hun's whereabouts. I also found it strange that he didn't come to his wife's memorial service. It's been... five years since I've seen him. I see. But yesterday, a guy stayed in front of Mrs. Hong's tablet for quite some time. I was wondering... if he is involved by any chance. -Who was he? -He was a young man. A young man... Just a moment please. Did he look like him? Yes, that's him. I remember him because he came here five years ago. -He was here five years ago? -Yes. It was... around the end of August. It was 100 days before the college entrance exam. I remember that many people came to pray on that day. Park Ji-hoon came to take one of his wife's belongings on that day. Mr. Park ran away as soon as he saw that guy. -Are you sure it's him? -Yes, I'm sure. Who the heck is he? Why is he lingering around Bong-pal? In-rang, why don't you go and kill yourself this time? if you keep it up, I'm going to snitch on to your grandma. Oh please, be a man. Don't tattle on me. I guess you don't want your grandma to find out, huh? Why? Go ahead and say "I loved you, Hyun-ji!" in front of your grandma. Hey! Bong-pal! Cheon-sang. Are you feeling okay? You drank a lot yesterday. I'm okay. This won't do. You two are hopeless. There is no future for Blood Sausage Soup. You feebile fools, let's go. -Go. -Where are we going? I'm going to set your mind straight. You have recently experienced a formidable incident. You've got to get over it, or it will leave a deep scar in your mind. It is called... trauma. And it is quite a thing. No. Don't run away. You have to overcome it. Otherwise, you will fall into sudden depression. Well, I'm doing fine. The first step toward depression. Denial. You won't acknowledge nor accept it. What the crap? I'm leaving. Recently, have you resented someone? Have you wanted to kill, pinch, or bite someone? Yes or no? -Yes, I-- -This is step two. Rage. You blame it all on others and get angry. You pout in anger. You whine and grumble... What is the third step then? Depression. You separate yourself from reality and fall into depression. Blood Sausage Soup cannot go that far. You must overcome all of this. Try to comfort yourself by breathing in and out deeply. Try it with me. What the heck? We're so focused. Huh? It's the manager. Hi, this is Choi Cheon-sang, your 24-hour exorcism service. How may I help you? Ah, the exorcism. Sir, the thing is... we're on a break temporarily... I'm sorry. Take care. Is it work? -Yeah, but you're under the weather-- -It's okay. -Let's go. -Are you sure? INTERNET CAFE DAEHAN STUDY JUNG-GU DAEHAN STUDY ACADEMY ADDRESS: 458-1 SOPA-RO, 4TH FLOOR JUNG-GU, SEOUL -Professor Joo? -Hello, Doctor. Long time no see! How long has it been? We haven't met since we volunteered at Chuncheon Hospital. Right, it's been around eight months. It seems you're quite busy these days. I hardly see you volunteer at hospitals anymore. Yes, I've been busy lately. I'm going to start again soon. Come and volunteer at our hospital. We've gotten a lot of patients receiving psychotherapy. We are having a hard time keeping up with the needs. Don't go to other hospitals, okay? -I won't. -You said you had a favor? Did someone get admitted? No... I'm looking for a person. I found no medical record on Park Ji-hun. He's neither on the guardians list. Na-yeon! -Gosh! Na-yeon, are you okay? -Are you okay? Let's go to a hospital. Where did it go? Shoot, they must've taken it together. What should I do? Hey, Mom! I'm not at Uncle's place yet. I'll be right there. I came out for a bit to do someone a favor. Yeah, okay. I'll call you when I get there. Okay. DAEHAN STUDY ESSAY ACADEMY DAEHAN STUDY ESSAY ACADEMY This is where I died. Doctor, this is Hye-sung. Can you look into one more person for me? The name is Kim Hyun-ji. I'd really appreciate it. What is wrong with me? Does she remember? Young lady. Where is the stuff you're supposed to deliver? Hey, young lady. Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! It's Mom, Hyun-ji! Stay with me... Hyun-ji! HANIL UNIV. HOSPITAL KIM JU-SEONG Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Mom... Hanil University Hospital... Mom? It's me. I'll go home and be right back. They can't guarantee what will happen. Let's talk about that later. Okay. Is this where I lived? Mom. Dad. I'm sorry, Mom. I came too late. I'm so sorry. Um... Guys... the Pyeonghwa-road ghost... That's a very old one, huh? Yes, you're right. The rumor started ever since the road opened to the public. I guess it's been about 30 years. I think that's when the lady died in an accident. I bet you'd wet yourself if you ever saw a ghost that old. 15 people have died in car accidents ever since then. How long do we have left? Oh, we're almost there. We'll be there in five minutes. ACCIDENT HAZARD Why did you turn it on? Turn it off! I didn't. -It's not working. -What? Damn. Come on. Cheon-sang, look! Oh god! Please! I did not hit a human, did I? Tell me I didn't! Please! -Go out and take a look! -I can't! I'm scared to death! You didn't hit anyone. Guess it was the evil spirit you said earlier. Thank you! Thank you, God! Bong-pal, where is the evil spirit? I don't see it. -Hey, where are you going? -I'll look around. Okay. Okay, watch your back! -Let's go back in the car. -Be careful. Bong-pal! Hello? Yes, I'll be right there. Taxi! Mom, where are you going? -Be careful, it's dangerous! -Taxi! Taxi! Hang in there. The hospital is not far away. I'm okay, it's just a scratch. You are not okay! Your head is bleeding! Let's get an MRI or CT scan. You're a valuable asset of our company. You can't get any scratches! Cut the crap and drive faster! Go to a big hospital, okay? Okay. -Come on! Hurry! -We're here! -I'm fine. -Are you sure? He's keep bleeding. Doctor! She's in shock. We need to transfer her to the ICU. Mom... Hyun-ji! Your arm will be fine as long as you take care of it properly. Frequent cold massages will help. Doctor, what about his head? He hit it pretty hard trying to avoid a car. The wound isn't that big, but why don't you get an x-ray? No, it's fine. It doesn't hurt that much. Listen to the doctor. He's not a doctor for nothing, you know. -I'll prepare the x-ray then. -Thank you. Dude, stay still. Take some rest here. In-rang and I will go and take care of the paperwork. It's fine. I'll take care of the paperwork. No way. It's an industrial accident, okay? As CEO of Blood Sausage Soup, I will take the full responsibility for my employees' medical welfare. So stay put. We'll be back. Let's go. Rest up. She went into sudden shock, but she's in stable condition now. We'll watch over her for a bit and then transfer her to a general ward. Will she be okay? Why does she keep going into shock, Doctor? As of now, it's hard to explain why. I can only tell you to wait and see. PATIENT CARD KIM HYUN-JI (FEMALE, 24) I'm... alive. August 23, 2011. I've been in a coma for five years. What a relief that I'm alive. Bong-pal will be happy if he knows. Bong-pal... You're alive. Yes, Doctor? I did what you asked, Kim Hyun-ji is a patient at our hospital. She was admitted 5 years ago due to a car accident. She's been in a coma ever since. Is there a chance... that she might wake up? Well... Not likely according to her chart. But I can't say it's impossible. There's a case where a patient woke up from a 10-year coma. I see... Thank you. Can't say it's impossible... Bong-pal! Why is he here? Bong-pal! Hyun-ji. Bong-pal, I'm sorry. What happened? I won't leave you again. I don't have to. Bong Pal, I'm alive-- Hyun-ji. Hyun-ji? Hyun-ji. Cardiac arrest! Cardiac arrest? Check vitals! Charged! Clear! Shoot! Shoot! Clear! Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji wasn't a ghost but a soul, right? -I saw Hyun-ji! -Bong-pal, wait! Who are you? You have a death wish? Don't mess with me. Watch your back. If he's real, he won't go down easily. What's the matter? Let's go to the police! -What are you gonna do? -I'll reinvestigate Prof. Joo. Director, someone is here to see you. This is not a restroom. What should I do with you? Bong-pal! Subtitle translation by: Hye Young Beom
