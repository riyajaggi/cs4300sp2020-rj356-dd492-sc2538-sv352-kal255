 Oh my, he's so photogenic too! He's so cool. He's so cool. Wait, where is this sound coming from? It might be around here... MONK MYUNG-CHEOL KIM HYUN-JI Oh my goodness. Coming all the way in here... What a hassle. We now have a problem. You... can see me?

 -Senior, I'm sorry, but I have to go. -Oh, sure. I hope you're not late for your appointment because of me. No, it's okay. I'll see you at school. Okay, we're closing now. Hyun-ji! Is she waiting inside? Sir, you can't enter because we're closed. -There's someone I have to find... -Excuse me? Never mind. Hyun-ji. Hyun-ji. Kim Hyun-ji? Where did she go? Hyun-ji! You're here. I'm sorry that I couldn't make it. -Why couldn't you come? -The thing is... Something came up. I'm sorry. Let's go to the amusement park some other time. -Fine. -Did you wait for a long time? No! I just left right away when you didn't come. That's a relief. I thought you were waiting for me. Why would I wait for you this whole time? Have you seen that person before? He's about 174 cm tall and 44 years old. And his name is Park Ji-hun. Do you know the boarding house in Yangjoo Village? He lives there. It's my first time seeing him. Monk, it's very rare for accidents to occur here. If there is, we get a report right away. I've never seen this man before. I'll make a report now, so please go to the back mountains and search the area. What search? What do you mean? I just showed you that picture. This rock is all coated in red! Look how red this rock is next to the green one! Something happened, so please go and search the area! That is not going to be of any help. There's not many people in this precinct to go on a search. Then what are you going to do? This is bad! Please, that's enough. If you're that upset, fill this out. There's blood splattered all over the mountains! We're not going to get anything done by writing a report! Please don't throw a fit here. Just fill that report out. How do I fill this out? Where is it? Where's that package? Tell me. Do you think I'm going to tell you? That child died because of you. Do you know that? That child died... because you didn't tell me. Tell me. If you don't... your son will die. This is your last chance. Tell me! -Aren't you going? -Where? -To school. -No, I'm not going. -I'm going to stay home. -That's a surprise. You always follow me. Do I have to follow you every day? Fine then, stay home. I'm going to go. That's right, I'm going to stay home! I'm really not good at this hard-to-get thing. I never asked her to follow me. She's the one who's always tagging along. Gosh, it's actually nice not having her around. You scared me! -How long have you been there? -I just got here. What are you mumbling to yourself? Nothing. Why did you follow me? I'm not following you. I'm going because I want to. Well... I'm sure you are. What is up with that puppy dog smile? Who are you looking at? This picture is from our retreat. Who is making you smile like that... No. Not... Seo-yeon. Absolutely no way! Never, ever! What are you going to do if Bong-pal finds out? Are you a weirdo? Huh? You're being treacherous! -How dare you have feelings for... -What are you talking about? Why would I have feelings for Seo-yeon? -You're being ridiculous. -Then who is it? Then... Is it me? Yeah, take me instead. You can have my body. -No! Get away from me! -Take me. Ow, my nipples! Who is it then? Is it Bong-pal? -No. -Hello. Bong-pal, he keeps smiling whenever he looks at you. He's acting so weird. No, I'm not! -That's not true! -Who's making you smile then? Look. What is that? Is it a ghost? Is that a picture of a ghost? Hey, it's me! They got me on camera! My angel. Your angel. An angel? -The angel you saw at the retreat? -Yes, it's that angel. He says I'm an angel. Angel, my butt. Right. When I rolled down the stairs that time, if it wasn't for my angel... I would've died. At that time the angel asked me... "Are you okay?" She saved me with those words and stole my heart. Oh my gosh, I think he's fallen for me. Right? At that moment... I think you did get a hole in your head back then. That ghost didn't steal your heart, she took your wits from you! -Wake up! -Who cares if it's a ghost! Look! She's so pretty, kind and cute. -What do you think? -She's kind? -She looks nice. -She's cute? I guess I must be pretty. It was love at first sight. - Right? - Oh please. Happy? Someone just said they like me. Wouldn't you be happy about it? Anyway, he is not normal. -Who? -Who do you think? Senior In-rang. I could understand Cheon-sang because he's naturally weird. But Senior In-rang is weirder. No way, he's not weird at all. That's a natural response from looking at me. You're the one who is weird. You're a bit overconfident today. She's so pretty, but she's prettier when she smiles. Seriously, she's just an angel when she smiles. What are you doing? Hurry up. What's so pretty about her? Senior In-rang is crazy. That girl's arm is injured. Bong-pal. Hello, Senior. I didn't even say a proper thank you to you yesterday. I would've had a hard time if you weren't with me at the hospital. Thanks for staying with me. You said you had a prior engagement. Were you late because of me? Ah... yes, well... What the heck? He was preoccupied because he was with that girl. If it's okay with you, I'll treat you to a meal today. What do you think? -That's okay. -It's because I'm grateful. Okay. -Hello. -Yes, hello. I have something to say before we start class. I'm sure there are other students who already know about this. Your fellow classmate Noh Hyun-joo has been in an unfortunate accident. Hyun-joo's funeral information is on the notice board outside. If you knew her, it would be nice if you can make it to her funeral. Okay, I'll start calling off names now. -Kim Oh-chang. -Here. Okay. -Na Jin-soo. -Here. Okay. -Park Bong-pal. -Here. Okay. Good for you that you're alive. And Bong-pal likes you too. Okay, that's all for today. -Good job, everyone. -Thank you. Bong-pal, what do you like to eat? Let's eat what you like. I'm sorry, Senior, but let's just call it even. -I have to go home. -What? -I'm sorry. -Sure. -Hello. -Yes, hello. Are you heading somewhere? Yes, there's a seminar. What's going on? It's nothing really. We forgot to ask you a question the other day. -What is it? -Well... Where were you on the day Noh Hyun-joo was murdered? Ah, I have to ask because it's protocol, so please don't be so concerned. I was at the veterinary clinic that day. The veterinary clinic? I understand. I apologize for bothering you when you're so busy. -Not at all. Have a good day. -Yes, thank you. You're home early. Weren't you supposed to have lunch with her? I didn't eat with her. Why? She would've bought you something delicious to eat. I just wanted to eat at home. You bought meat. Yeah, I want to eat it. -You don't like it? -I don't feel like eating it, but I'll give it a taste since you bought it. You said you were only going to give it a taste. Yeah, but I still can't taste it. Eat slowly, or you'll lose your jaw. About the... About the amusement park. -Let's go tomorrow. -Really? Yes. Hey, that's not fully cooked. Eat this one. -Here. -What is this? You're my partner. Wear it when you work. Really? Wow! Okay, sure. The breeze is cool and nice. I like it too. Darn it. Let's hurry it up! -Mr. Kim, help this team out. -Okay. Come on, let's hurry it up! There's not much time left! Okay, we got it. What are we doing here in the middle of the night? Take it out, hurry! -Come on, let's go! -This is scary. There's nothing to be afraid of! I'll pay you twice the amount, so let's get this over with! -I'm not sure about this. -It's perfectly fine! Mr. Kim, over here! -Hurry it up! -We're going! Hurry up and get inside! Hello? Excuse me? Hello? I can't hear you very well. Hold on! What? I see. What am I supposed to do then? We have to work overnight to get it done in time! Ghosts or whatever! We have to make a living too! Hello? Hello? I swear! What's wrong over there? The backup generator has gone out! Seriously, nothing is going as planned! Who is crazy? Me? I'm not crazy! Why would I be crazy? What the heck? Who is crazy? I'm not crazy! Who is crazy? I'm not crazy! SUNDAE SOUP Wow! Wow, did we really get a job to do? The place we've all been waiting for. Samil Mental Institute. -Did you call Bong-pal? -Of course. Make sure you check the camera and all the necessary equipment thoroughly today. We might be able to capture a ghost on camera for real today. -Right. -Setting! What do you think? It fits you well. What are we going to do about the amusement park today? -We're supposed to go today. -We can go after work. -Work hard so we can get there quickly. -Let's go. Senior, where are we going today? You brought the camera with you. Huh? Oh... Make sure you're ready today. -Why? -The place we're going to is one of the scariest locations in the world. That's right. It's the Samil Mental Institute! -Is it your first time hearing about it? -Yes. Everything about Bong-pal is great, but he's clueless about this field. In-rang will give you the 411 on that place. That place is... That place was shut down due to human rights issues ten years ago. The doctors and caretakers illegally held the patients against their will and abused them as well. It was very severe. One patient couldn't take it anymore and escaped. That's how the world found out about the hospital -You can speak now. -The police came and discovered seven patients who died in the hospital. Seven people. The building owner called exorcists and shamans to get rid of the ghosts. There are rumors that a shaman fainted within 30 minutes of entering and died. This is a place full of ghosts with deep grudges. Hey, it's dark here. What the heck? Wow, Cheon-sang! Cheon-sang! Look at this. I'm going. Grab onto me. -Grab onto me. Hold tight! -Don't let go. Don't let go. They're such scaredy-cats. Why are they doing this kind of work? Hold on tight! You want to fight? Both of them are not normal. -I'm going to go. -Okay. Let's go. -Grab onto me! -Don't let go. Don't let go! Hyun-ji, are you okay? What's wrong? I'm okay. Bong-pal! Bong-pal! Quickly, come here! What is it? Look over there. I think it's over there. -That's where the ghost is? -Yes. "Inpatient Ward." I think it's over there. -Cheon-sang! -What? -It's the Casualty Department. -Hey, start recording. Hold me tight. -Hold me tight. -I will hold you tight. This place looks really scary. Okay. Let's go. We got this. Is this the right place? What the? Where did they go? It looks like something is in there. One, two, three. -Oh my goodness. -Oh my. -Oh my god! What is this? -It's just a string. -Where is Bong-pal? -What? Let's go find him. Pal! Bong-pal! Bong-pal! Wait. This is the right place. He may not have gotten here yet. He might have gotten lost... -What if we got lost? -Call him. Hurry up and call him. Gosh, what is this? Bong-pal. Bong... Come on. Darn it. Hey, don't touch things in here. -I told you not to touch things in here. -I'm sorry. Bong-pal, didn't you say seven people died in this hospital? Yes, why do you ask? Take a look at this. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... And eight. Kim Jeong-soon died of a leg fracture. No known family? NAME OF PATIENT: KIM JEONG-SOON Pal? Bong-pal? -Uh, we're coming in, Bong-pal. -Excuse me, Bong-pal. PLEASE SAVE ME PLEASE HELP ME Bong-pal! Pal? -Wait a second. -What is it? My back is killing me, gosh. He's not here. Hey, what is this? There is the angel. -Angels! -An angel, my butt.. -Get over here now! -Hold on. Miss Angel! PLEASE HELP ME I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji-- Bong-pal, stop. These ghosts won't hurt us. What? Come over here. Over there. I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE HELP ME I think they want us to help them. You are the ones who called, right? Detective Kim! -Did you find something? -Yes, I did. Over there! They wanted us to find them. All these dead people had no known family or friends. It's good that they are found now. I will go now. Bong-pal, wait a minute. Well... It's just that... Do you... Do you walk around with a ghost by any chance? How can you say that? No, she was an angel. Isn't she with us now? Well... I saw everything earlier. I saw her rescue us. Right, I did see her. It was my first time seeing a ghost fight another ghost. Are you working with that angel? Yes, but... she's no angel. Her name is Hyun-ji. Kim Hyun-ji. Hyun-ji? Kim Hyun-ji. What a pretty name. Is it? So is she right next to us now? She's right here. Right here? Hyun-ji, thanks so much for saving us last time and also this time. And... you're so pretty. Oh my, it was no problem. I'm pretty, all right. Don't you agree? I can't stand hearing this. I just can't. Wait a second. So Hyun-ji is right around here... What do you think you're doing? I was just wondering if she was around here... Still, you can't touch a girl like that. Did my hand touch her? Hyun-ji, I'm sorry. I didn't think it'd touch you. -What's the matter with you? -I will go now. -Hurry. Aren't we going today? -I'm coming. Bye bye. No way. Such a thing is here, huh? He was acting funny. Why did he get mad? See you tomorrow! -Can I go in now? -Now? -Yes. -You can, but you won't get to ride many at this hour. You may be able to ride only the Ferris wheel. I like the Ferris wheel. -One ticket, please. -Sure, it's 10,000 won. By the way, didn't you come at this hour yesterday? Ah, I did... The last ride of the Ferris wheel will be in ten minutes. Let's run. We might be late. -Here it is. -You're riding this alone? Yes, I am. Did you come here yesterday? Well, yes. I did come, but I was late. You weren't here, either. I see. Too bad that you will only get to ride one tonight. I still like it. If you do well on exams, I will bring you here again. -Let's get here earlier then. -Sure. Are you that happy? I didn't know you'd like something like this. Bong-pal. I like you. What? -Well, Hyun-ji... -Don't say anything. I didn't say that to hear your answer. It's just how I feel. I'm crazy. So crazy. Why did I have to tell him that I like him right then? Gosh, how am I supposed to face Bong-pal again? Puppy, what should I do now? I don't think I can go home like this. Look at me, please. What should I do? What should I do, huh? Hey, Kim Hyun-ji. Bong-pal. How could you disappear like that? -Kim Hyun-ji! -Bong-pal. Professor Joo. Hello. You live nearby, huh? Yes. So this is your hospital, huh? I've passed by this place so many times. By the way, who were you calling just now? -Pardon? -I thought you were calling someone. -Kim Hyun-ji? -Ah... -Is she your girlfriend? -No. -She's just someone I know. -Ah, is she? I will go now then. Sure, get home safe. Bye. What should I say when I see Bong-pal again? Gosh, what should I do? Hyun-ji, are you asleep? Get some sleep then. Bong-pal. I like you. Is he still asleep? -Good morning. -It sure is... I need to go to the bathroom... What good morning, gosh. Well, I'm done. I'm full, too. Gosh, this is crazy. So what? She could have feelings for me. It's not a reason to avoid her. Okay then. Go out and act natural. Okay, okay. Gosh, it's so uncomfortable and crazy. Act natural. Gosh, should I go stay somewhere else? There is no other place to go. It's so uncomfortable for two of us alone. CHEON-SANG Hi, Cheon-sang. I will be right there. Hyun-ji, we have work. Let's go. -Do we? Let's go. -Sure. Sure, I should do something or anything. You sure know how to do a good job. Are you already done? We will get some money again today. I don't know where she is, but you also did a good job, Hyun-ji. -Good work. -Cheon-sang, she's over here. Good work. By the way, where is In-rang? He said he had to go get something from the car. -Wait. Are you already done? -Yes, it's done. -Are you hurt? -I'm not hurt-- I'm talking about Hyun-ji, not you. Is she hurt? -She's not hurt at all. -Oh my, thank god. So Hyun-ji is with us now, right? Correct. Hyun-ji, I got something for you. -What did you get? -What could it be? -These. -Wow, they are heels. Hey, you've never gotten me anything. You got heels for a ghost you can't even see? Quiet. -Does Hyun-ji seem to like these? -Tell him that I love them. She hates them. I said I love them. She hates them? She says she's never liked heels. -Right? -I do like heels. She's never liked them, huh? -Well, too bad then. -Isn't it? -We will go now. -Sure. Gosh, why do you lie? I so want to accept these... Park Bong-pal! No matter what you do, certain things just can't work out. It's okay. Do you know what I went through to get these? We will exchange them. Pardon? Our Director? Yes, what was his schedule on the first? He didn't have anything specific that day. He was seeing patients until the afternoon. What time in the afternoon? He ended early that day. Around seven. He usually stays until nine. -He may have had an appointment then. -Was it that day? It's when he didn't get back. -He didn't get back all night? -Yes. He usually sleeps here. He left earlier and came back the next morning that day. -Oh my, you're here! -Hello, Director. I'm sorry for being late. Please prepare everything until I get back from class. Where has he been to get mud on his shoes? -He came back with mud on his shoes. -Yes. Thank you. -You're late. -I had a seminar. What brings you here today? We just came by for routine questions. We're off now. See you next time. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Was everything okay? -Yes. What should we do? What's the matter with you? You wouldn't let me accept the present. I agree. Why did I do that? It's so childish. What? You've changed your clothes. -It's convenient being a ghost. -Well, you know how it is. I can't take this anymore. It's so uncomfortable. Bong-pal. What? Shall we play a game to grant our wishes? We will play rock-paper-scissors. Whoever loses will have to grant the winner's wish. Why grant wishes? I don't want to play. Can we please do it? I didn't even get the heels or anything. Fine. Let's play. -Let's play. -We're doing it. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! I won! Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! One, two, three. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! Hooray! Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! Hooray! One, two. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! Hooray! I'm so good. I won! Hooray! You're such a kid. So what's your wish? Well, my wish would be... to take back what I said yesterday. I don't like being uncomfortable with each other. Just forget everything I said. That's my wish. One minute you're confessing and now you want me to forget? Why are you confusing me? You understand, right? It's my wish, so you have to do what I ask. If you do what I ask now I can stay with you longer. Bong-pal. Hyun-ji. I'm not feeling well... Kim Hyun-ji! -Bong-pal. -Hyun-ji. Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji. Kim Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Bong-pal. Where did you go? Don't ever disappear again... I loved you, Kim Hyun-ji! It's too hot. You can sleep in my room. You're so crazy about a girl that you'd sell your country. Love makes you do crazy things. You crazy punk! He's too perfect to be considered human. Puppy, where are you? Who said you could come in without my permission? You look familiar. Have we met? Are we going to be okay this way? People can see you. I don't care if they look at me funny. It's about you, Hyun-ji. Subtitle translation by OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
