 I have no idea what I'm doing. -Pal-bong! Hey! -Hey, hey! Oh my, you're so pretty. Gosh, why is a ghost so heavy? What? How am I heavy? I'm light! I must be light! I'm as light as a feather! Let's go! Make sure you hide real good. I can see your hair. Make sure you hide real good.

 I can see your hair. Make sure you hide real good. I can see your hair. I can't believe I'm making hangover soup for a ghost. What the heck am I doing? Kim Hyun-ji, wake up. Hey, Kim Hyun-ji. Kim Hyun-ji, wake up. -Why? -It's time to eat. Come out. Oh, my head. Bong-pal, my head hurts. What's wrong with me? I feel nauseous too. You feel nauseous too? Nice going. You were no joke yesterday. Can ghosts get drunk? I guess so. How did we get in last night?

 You don't even remember last night, do you? I thought my back would give out because I carried you home. You carried me home? Of course. Who else would do that? Sit down and eat. It's bean sprout soup! Did you make this hangover soup for me? You wish. I just had some left over, so I decided to make some. Why? Delicious. Thank you for the meal. -What is it? -Heart! What's this? Heart! Heart! Junior Bong-pal, our love is going to arrive soon. What's up with these seniors? 3,500,000 WON HAS BEEN DEPOSITED Please take your savings book. 3,500,000 WON FROM DEPOSITOR KIM IN-RANG 1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000 100,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000... 100,000,000 won? Wait a minute. How much is 100,000,000 won? Wow, you're very rich. Why have you been acting poor when you've been loaded all this time? Let's use that money to buy something good to eat, huh? -That's not what I'm using it for. -Then where are you going to spend it? Aren't you making money to make a living? Ah, are you going to buy a house or a car? -No. -What are you going to use it for? Are you thinking of buying something extravagant? It's my money and I'm going to use it however I want. Mind your own business. It must be nice to see ghosts and make tons of money. -It's not all that great. -Why not? Because of your gift, you make a lot of money. And you have a pretty ghost like me as your sidekick. Gosh, you're being ridiculous this morning. That's enough, okay? I'm late. That's my bus. Hey, wait for me! -Where did she go? -Bong-pal, over here! It's nice to have a ghost around. Look at that. Can you scoot over? Where am I supposed to sit? I'm sorry, but it's taken. Excuse me? -What are you talking about? It's empty. -I'm sorry. -Forty-eight. -Forty-eight. -Forty-nine. -Forty-nine. Fifty... Fifty... -Fifty! -Fifty! We just have to do this several more times, right? I know. But we need Junior Bong-pal to make it happen. I know. That's why we need to recruit him. How? He won't even register for our club. -Who am I? -Choi Cheon-sang. Am I just Choi Cheon-sang? I'm a charming magician who can make everyone fall for me. Mansour. Perhaps Gates? Bill Gates? Bill Gates! These are the final scores of your last reports. Come and take them. Park Bong-pal, you're pretty smart. Good job. I gave you over a week to complete this assignment. What have you all been doing? Copy and paste, grammatical errors, typos. Such poor and meaningless reports! How is it that Park Bong-pal is the only one who got an A plus? This is Park Bong-pal's report. Take a look at it, get some inspiration. This was a group project, yet Bong-pal did it on his own and still did better than all of you. You have until next week. Any group that gets below a C will have to submit it again, got it? -Got it? -Yes. Good, I'll see you next week. He's such a jerk. There's some strange rumors going around about Bong-pal. What is it? Something strange always happens when you're with him. I even heard that the kid who fought against him died. -For real? -That's scary. I didn't like the look in his eyes from the beginning. Anyway, it's bad luck if you hang out with him. There won't be any reason for us to hang out with him. He's an outsider anyway. Bong-pal. -Bong-pal. -Yeah? -Do you like being alone? -Yes. It's not boring? You always eat alone too. No, I like it. I mean, it's fun hanging out and eating together with friends. We would only talk about girls and play video games. You call that fun? It is fun! Talking about menial things like that is fun. That's how you build friendships and get to enjoy the perks of campus life. Isn't that college life? It's all a waste of time. I'd rather read another book. Still, it wouldn't hurt to have a friend help you out when you need it. It's fine. I can take care of myself. The director is late today. He's never been late before. I know. He didn't return after he went out yesterday. -Do you think he stayed out all night? -With a woman? No! There's no way! I'm sure he didn't. -Oh my, you're here! -Hello, Director. I'm sorry for being late. I'll check the appointment chart after I come back from class. Please prepare everything until then. Okay, we will. Where has he been to get mud on his shoes? -He probably went to the shelter again. -You think so? Junior Bong-pal. -Hi. -Do you have time to spare? Why? MYONGSUNG UNIV: NEW CLUB PRESIDENT: CHOI CHEON-SANG VP: KIM IN-RANG Sometimes... a day will come that changes everything. We are in the center of that right now. Center, middle, center. We will be in the center of it all. How? With the state of the art multi-communication system! Speed, accuracy, and a thorough AS screen. A 24-hour... exorcism system. All of this... has been gathered in one place. The name is... Sundae Soup. Sundae Gukbap! Sundae soup? Is he setting up a restaurant? What is that? I have no clue. Hold on. Where are you going? To class. You're just going to go after listening to this impressive presentation? -I have no idea what you're saying. -What do you mean? What do you mean? I'm saying let's work together! If we bring work to you like last time at the sauna you come and save the day. -And you get your end of the cut, right? -And we get... That's not how we would put it exactly. I mean, you're right, but we would also be doing this for the sake of... peace. Peace. So, it's kind of like a service fee. -In what way? -So... So we could provide you with transportation. Or like some sort of physical exam. The truth of it is, you'll run into difficulties if you do this alone and we would be willing to take care of all that for you. We would also collect all the exorcism fees that you still need to receive. Please think about it. You're too busy studying and getting rid of ghosts! There's so much stuff you need to be concerned with. If we hunt down work for you... Hold on, hold on! You would take the car we provide for you... Right, good job. You would go to the ghost and just... Okay! Okay! You would go and catch the ghost and take our car back home. How comfortable is that? Hey, that's not a bad idea. What do you think? Ah! We got some work for you from the community gym. And we collected several overdue fees as well. The community gym. How much are they going to pay? Three bank notes. Three million won? Deal. Okay, then please go ahead and sign this contract. I'm not interested in joining the club. Still, this would mean that you have agreed to -I'm going to go. -work together as a team... He's leaving. -We did it! -Sundae Soup! Bong-pal. Hello, Senior. You're going to class, right? Let's go together. Sure, let's go. What is it? It's nothing. By the way, have you decided who you're going to work with on the final exam? -It's a group project. -No. Do you want to do it with me? My Bong-pal can do it all by himself! -Yes, I'd love to. -Great. Let's go. What's so great about her? -What? -I just thought of a good idea. Bait that will make Bong-pal join our club. -Hello. -Hello. The weather is very nice today, isn't it? Let's go somewhere! Let's go somewhere! I bet you want to have fun on a day like this. Shall I let you all go early today? Yes! I'll think about it if you pay attention in class. Let's check attendance first. -Kim Ho-chan. -Here. -Na Jin-soo. -Here. Okay. Noh Hyun--joo. Student Noh Hyun-joo. Noh Hyun-joo is absent again today. Thank you. Do you want to eat together today? Since you're helping me with class, I'll buy something good to eat. Is that okay? Yes, it's fine with me. What about you? It's fine with me too. -Shall we go? -Yes. Welcome. Please have a seat. Oh, wait! -What is it? -Well, the thing is... -There's some dust here. -Thanks. What the heck? This dish is very good. It's nothing. He's gained a good amount of weight. It seems that way. He must be eating well now. Yes. What do you think? Isn't he adorable? Yes, he's adorable. Bong-pal, where do you live? I live near the school. What a relief. I felt bad for making you come out early to prepare for my class. You must be living by yourself if you live near the school. Yes. Then where do your parents live? Ah, they live somewhere else. They must live far away. Do you see them often? Not really... Meet and call them often. Have you talked to your father recently? Why do you ask that? It's nothing. By the way, are the preparations for your final exams going well? Yes, we're going to start soon. Midterms didn't end too long ago. It's too bad you've to prepare for finals so soon. -Dig in for now. -Thank you. Hyun-ji, why are you sitting here like this? It's nothing. I couldn't find my honey. Just where in the world is he hiding on this small campus? Just thinking about it makes me angry! Right? It's worth being angry over, right? Absolutely! How could he take the chair out? I know! He was so sweet to me on the bus. -What a jerk! -Huh? He's always scolding and nagging me. But he's always smiling and laughing like an idiot in front of that girl. -Are you talking about that blood sausage? -Yes. He's probably laughing and eating with that girl right now. I see. Who am I talking to? It must be nice not having me around. Watch where you're going. Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. Hey. Are you still hungover? You've been out of it since this morning. I'm fine. Why? What do you mean why? It's time to go home. Let's go. -Was it good? -Yeah, it was good. I'm sure it was since you ate with that girl. You know, it seems like Seo-yeon likes that professor. I don't blame her. He's good-looking and he has a nice personality. He's also very popular, unlike someone I know. Cut it out. It's Seo-yeon. Not! Do you enjoy making fun of me? Yes, it's the best thing in the world! -There's something on your shoe. -Huh? Where? What a nice bow! You are so immature! -That was not funny! -Yes it was! Hello, Miss Lim Seo-yeon. Who are you? We are close friends of Park Bong-pal. You know him, don't you? Economic major Park Bong-pal. -Yes. -We want to talk to you for a moment. Just for a moment. Our club had a difficult start and it's on the verge of disappearing. We have nowhere to go. What should we do, Miss Seo-yeon? What can I do to help? It's a very tiny favor. CLUB REGISTRATION FORM -Goodbye. -Goodbye. We did it! Ah, that's cold! You're such a good sleeper. You have no passion for studying whatsoever. I am passionate, but I fall asleep whenever I study. Get your act together. Passion. Fighting. Okay? Okay. So, how many did you solve? -You didn't even solve ten problems. -I couldn't because it's hard. Look. In the case when you're looking for R, say you have two infinite sets of numbers and all conditions are met and there's A and B... -Hey. -Yes? Oh... one more time. In the case when you're looking for R, say you have two infinite sets of numbers and all conditions are met and there's A and B... STAR ANIMAL CLINIC You scared me. I told you not to pop in whenever you want. I totally forgot. Knock, knock. Why did you come in? Just because. I can't fall asleep and I'm bored. You sleep when you should be studying. Of course you can't fall asleep. You were so cute when you were little. What happened to you? You know, your mom is very pretty. Those heels... Whom do these belong to? Can you burn them for me? Ah... they were your mom's? Yes. It's time for you to leave now. I'm going to bed. Okay. Okay, I will. Bong-pal. I'm sorry. I didn't know they belonged to your mom. Good night. -Hyun-ji. -Yes? Turn off the lights. Okay. Dad, it's so loud! -We moved here for nothing! -I swear! Come out! Do you know what time it is right now? I've had enough! What the heck are you doing? You're not the only ones who live here! Come out! I said come out! Shut your kids up! It looks like Bong-pal lives here. It's close to the school. -Did you tell Bong-pal we're coming? -I did. He'll come down. But is this even considered a car? Huh? I'm impressed that this thing even made it here. Where did you get it? What do you mean? I had to go through a lot to get it. I begged my cousin who left for the army to get it. How long has he driven this car? 500,000 kilometers? What is this? Some kind of an airplane? I knew it. This is why the engine was having trouble. Just be grateful that we have this. If this was what you were going to borrow why did you say that we could provide transportation? We should provide anything for him to work with us. You've seen how picky he is. Plus, we could sleep in there for a while too. Sleep? In there? In here? Are you crazy? It's hot in here. This car doesn't have air conditioning? By the way, where are we going? Weren't we going to the community gym? We got an urgent offer, so we had to switch. Now we're going to an apartment building in Eunsung. Every night, they hear a kid cry and... you know, thumping noises as if someone is running around. So the tenants downstairs went up there. They went there and found the unit was empty. It's been empty for one year. A guy was offered cheaper rent and moved in. He had no idea that a ghost was living up there. The rent of the whole building is going down because of the ghost. The chairman of the building community is worried. So she promised to pay us a whopping five million. Hey, that's awesome! Here we are. That's the place. Bong-pal, you stay here. We will go meet with the chairman and discuss the contract in more detail. Which unit is it? I will go take a look around first. You're such a professional, aren't you? -What was the unit number? -Unit 617 in building B. -We will be right back. -Okay. Wow, there is a playground. Bong-pal, can we please go there to play a bit? Come on. We're here to work. Gosh, she's all about eating and playing. Bong-pal, let's play here a bit. Bong-pal, let's ride this one. Sit there, will you? What are you, a little kid? -Plus, I don't like this. -You don't like so many things. Here you are again. Excuse me, I told you not to come here again. Do you understand me? Gosh, this is driving me crazy... -Ma'am, please take her away now. -I'm sorry. Hee-jeong, let's go, okay? Why did you come here again? What if you get in trouble again? Let's go. Ma'am, please take her away. The residents here will make a fuss about this. They're already unhappy the market value is going down because of the ghost story. -Do not show up here ever again. -I understand. Hurry up now. -Let's go. -Hurry and leave. Hee-jun, let's go. VIRGIN BODHISATTVA What? What do you want me to write? I want you to write an amulet to keep ghosts away. Give me a strong one. Why do you go around carrying the sword then, huh? If you need to come here for an amulet... Gosh, I've heard about you, but you really are useless, aren't you? Hey. Mee-sook, change that name. What's up with "Virgin Bodhisattva," huh? You've been married three times. How about Bodhisattva who makes her husbands die fast? Or Granny Bodhisattva? You seriously! By the way, about the motel case you asked In-hyuk about... Ah, Gampo Motel? Everything was handled well. I heard what happened. You almost fainted and ran when you saw the ghost. I didn't exactly run, but I was going to return at another time. Word travels fast, gosh. But the one who handled it instead of In-hyuk is very well known to be quite good in this field. Who is he? He's called Master Bong-pal or whatever. I don't know where he's from. -He's quite young, I hear. -Master Bong-pal? Bong-pal? Park Bong-pal? It sounds right. Why? Do you know him? Park Bong-pal, that punk... Write me one now. I HATE YOU DAD Did I scare you? I scared you good, didn't I? -Are you mad? -Let's not kid around at work. Gosh, you're no fun. Stop playing and cross over, okay? People can't sleep because of you. There... -It hurts. -Are you okay? -It's bent. -No, stretch. You don't want to bend it. -It's bent! -Stretch. -You've stretched too much. -I'm sorry. You saw how quickly I reacted, right? This is how I am. Someone else would hurt their chin. It's already back to normal, so stop. Look straight ahead and drive. All right then, Bong-pal. We have to exorcise tomorrow. So get plenty of rest at home. I almost forgot, Bong-pal. What do you think this is? -What is it? -It's our second present for you. This is our third present for you. MEMBER APPLICATION FOR GHOSTNET Lim Seo-yeon? That girl? No, it's... Why did you join? You said you weren't interested. You joined because of her, didn't you? Gosh, Park Bong-pal. We finally got it. Now we can move back into the club room. EUNSUNG-GU APARTMENT Hey, where are you going? Hello. -To the apartment building in Eunsung. -Why now? We're supposed to go tomorrow. You want to get back at that kid? Make sure you hide real good. I can see your hair. Make sure you hide real good. I can see your hair... -What is this about? -That kid... -That kid isn't playing. -What do you mean? ABUSED AND KILLED BY STEPFATHER IN EUNSUNG -He's running away. -From whom? Whom is he running away from? -The one who killed him. -Who is that? His stepfather. I've found you. -You punk. -I'm sorry. -Come with me, you little punk. -I'm sorry, Dad. Come on, you little punk. You little punk! -How could he do that? -Exactly! Gosh. Seriously? Don't we have to call the police? He's a little kid. What are you doing again? Leave! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my baby. I'm sorry. Dad, I was wrong. Dad, I was wrong. Don't do that. Dad, I was wrong. Dad, I was wrong. Dad, I was wrong. Are you okay? You! You killed my son? You! You want to die? Kill me! Mom! Bong-pal! Mom! There you are, my baby. Here you are, my poor baby... I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I couldn't protect you. I'm sorry, my baby. Mommy is very sorry. My baby... I'm so sorry that I don't know what to say. I'm sorry, my baby. My baby... My poor baby... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my baby. I'm sorry, my baby. I'm sorry, my baby. He must have been waiting for his mom. Gosh, he must have been so scared. I'm sorry, Bong-pal. My son. Mommy is very sorry. Bong-pal, I'm very sorry. Mommy, don't go. Mommy, don't leave. Mommy. Mommy! I'm sorry, my baby. I'm sorry, my baby. Bong-pal. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. Bong-pal. Bong-pal! What are you doing here? Have a seat. I told you to stop exorcising. -I don't exorcise. -I know everything. Master Bong-pal. That's what you're called, huh? If you do that, how am I supposed to face your late mother when I die? Why bring up my mother all of a sudden? Gosh, why did I do that back then, huh? If I hadn't made that mistake... Don't worry. What you worry about won't happen. And I am not blaming you. I'm grateful that you saved me. -Get up and drink at home. -No, I won't, punk. I have other places to go other than your place. You're as stubborn as your father. I'll go. Gosh, it has to hurt. I told you not to come here. You're a ghost! -I'm not a ghost. -I said go. -Go. I said go. -I'm not a ghost. Ghosts are over there. -Mommy! -Mommy! I'm telling you I'm not a ghost. Mommy. Mommy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ghosts... go away. -What's going on with me? -Why are you staring at me? Something is wrong with me. Do ghosts' hearts pound? Let's go have our membership training. -Sundae Soup! -Sundae Soup! I will play Cupid instead. You know one of your students named Noh Hyun-joo? It's been a long time. He closed down his booming business. Why did he come here? -It's so immature of you to do that! -I did that to get back at you. It's been known for that for a while. A ghost from the water appears there. Subtitle translation by
