 Mom... Bong-pal. Why don't you play with your friends? Why do you always play alone? Let's go. Look. It's really fun to play with your friends. Green light, red light. Green light, red light. Green light, red light. Green light, red light. I'm sorry. Please forgive me! Please forgive me. I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Please forgive me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. EPISODE 2 Is he coming back now? Where has he been all night? Hey. What took you so long? Do you know how long I waited? What are you doing here? -How did you know my address? -Did you forget? I'm a ghost. So why are you here? I just need to check something, so stay still for a minute. -What are you doing? -Just stay still for a minute. -Are you trying to hit on me? -Hey! -What? -I've got something to check with you. No way. You're talking rude. You're obviously younger than me. I'm flattered, but it's already been five years since I died. You're only a sophomore, right? So I'm older than you. Oh, really? Whatever. I'm done talking to you. I'm tired. Go away. He's annoying. Gosh, I forgot the key. What is it? Who invited you? Can't you just say thank you? Thank you very much. Please leave, Miss Ghost. What? Gosh. You don't look like one, but you're quite fastidious. Leave. Get out. Why don't you just do me the favor? It's so simple. You just need to close your eyes. No thanks. Do you think you're the first ghost to chase me around? I don't know what you're up to, but go look for someone else. Shall I introduce one to you? I just need you, so just help me this once. Huh? Can't you? Hey... No. How can you be so shameless? Where is my ten million won? Stop being so petty with money. What? Petty money? Where's my amulet to scare away ghosts? There! PARK JI-HOON Be careful. Don't break it. We can't afford to fix it. We've lost everything but that. Be careful. Let's take it to service center. -Cheon-sang. -What? I found it. Come here. Look. He just hit a ghost. We didn't see wrong, right? I think so, but... He did. He hit it. This white thing is the ghost. I'm sure... -You saw it, too. -Yes, I did. I'm sure he can see ghosts. That's why he could give the ghost a blow. He's an unusual person. But Cheon-sang, we saw the ghost, too. What's wrong with you? That's called silver code. Silver code? When people get extremely terrified, they see ghosts. The electrical wavelength that connects me and the ghost -is called silver code. -Oh, silver code. I told you to study. -You're the vice president, right? -Right. This guy, on the other hand, doesn't see the ghost through silver code. Look at his eyes. He's staring straight at the ghost, right? -Yes. -That's why he can fight ghosts. He's very talented. We need him. Does he really go to our college? Look it up now. You're the top student in information systems. Hurry. -Are you done already? -Yes. Let's see. He's a sophomore in economics. Park Bong-pal. Look at the dog. -Hello. -Hi. He's so cool. That's how guys should look. Are you a squid or what? You better carry a dog with you. How sad. You're having lunch alone. Rubbish. -Are you talking to me? -No. Of course not. Gosh, I love rolled omelet so much. Go get one for yourself. Why do you keep forgetting that I'm a ghost? You know I can't do that. Ghosts can only eat the food prepared by the living. That's what memorial services are for. -I see. -Now that you know it, give me that omelet and this one. Fine. Here it goes. This is so tasty. -Goodness, you're eating alone again. -How sad. Let me introduce myself properly. I'm Choi Cheon-sang, junior in physical education. I'm Choi Cheon-sang... And he is... I'm Kim In-rang, junior in information systems. -So what? -So... What do you mean? We overcame the hardships together last night, my brother. We saw... how courageous you were. So... So, why don't you join us? Let's fight against the darkness together. No thanks. -He's not an easy target. -He plays hard to get. Oh, it's cool. It's really cool. You're sweating. -Am I? -Yes. Hello. Wow, I have a lot of students here. I have only 22 on my list, but I see the waitlisted ones are here too. -Yes. -Yes. My lectures may be boring. Don't expect too much. Let me introduce myself first. Professor Lee Ji-sung, who taught Animal and Society, retired unexpectedly for personal reasons. So I'll be in charge of the rest of this course. I'm Joo Hye-sung, professor in veterinary. It's nice to see you. -Wow. -You're so handsome! Sir, you were so cool earlier. What about your hand? -Is it all right? -Yes, I'm okay. It feels like I've become famous. It's a little embarrassing. Well, let's begin. The enrolled students might be distracted, so I ask the rest of you to leave please. -I don't want to. -I want to stay here. See you next semester. All right. It's perfect. I prefer to teach a small group. Isn't it better for you too? -Yes. -I'll call the roll. -Noh Hyun-joo. -Here. It's nice to meet you. -Park Bong-pal? -Here. -Lim Seo-yeon. -Here. Good. It's good to see you. -Jeong Si-ah? -Here. Do you like her? -It's nice meeting you. -She's pretty. Lim Seo-yeon? Is that your type? Do you like girly girls? Please leave me alone. -Do you not have anywhere to go? -No. I have nowhere to go. Gosh, you're driving me crazy. You, there. The one on the third column? -Park Bong-pal? -Yes? Is there a problem? No, I'm sorry. Good. Let me continue. -Na Jin-soo? -Here. It's nice to meet you. Gosh. Our ranking dropped so much in a week. Oh, my God. It went down so much. Why does Sadako keep leaving hateful comments? I don't think we'll earn enough to fix the camera. -Gosh. -Then what are we going to do? It'll cost a fortune to fix that. Is anybody in there? I'm from the housing agency. I know you're in there. Please vacate the room by next week. Otherwise, you'll be kicked out. Do you understand? Gosh. -So what are we going to do now? -What do you think we're going to do? We must make Park Bong-pal join us by all means. Wouldn't that be hard? He doesn't even get along with students in his department. -Are they leaving him out? -He's probably leaving the others out. A lonely soul who turned his back to the world. He'll perfectly fit into our club. Stick to him like glue. He's our savior. Even if he doesn't join us right away, if we stick to him, we might succeed in filming ghosts. When that happens... We'll earn so much money. We'll become so popular. We'll get so many new members. -Among them will be... -Girls! -The electricity has been cut off. -It's dark. That's all for the first lecture. Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. The first one is always the hardest. I heard that I'll have an assistant. Who is it? -It's me. -Are you Lim Seo-yeon? Yes. I think it'll be too much work for one person. Does anyone want to help her? He can do it. Park Bong-pal? Then please help Seo-yeon. All right. See you next class. Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. You're also an economics student, right? A sophomore? -Yes. -You probably don't know me. -I study economics as well. -Of course, he knows you. I don't attend a lot of department activities. You liar. I'm Lim Seo-yeon. I'm in the senior year. It's nice to meet you. -Look forward to working with you. -You too. You're welcome. Don't forget to pay me back. I know you're happy. Take it easy. Good boy. You must have been hungry. Professor, I've been looking for you. What's the matter? These are Professor Lee's files I've been keeping. I don't know what to do with them. I'll return them to him. Thank you. Take it easy. Isn't this the dog that bit your hand? You're famous now. You're famous for being naughty. He's so cute. Are you going to keep him here? I'm just waiting for his owner. If no one shows up, I'll take him to the hospital tomorrow. Who's a good boy? -Joo Hye-sung speaking. -Professor Joo. It's your presentation in two hours. -You're not in the waiting room. -I'm still at the university. I'm sorry. I'll be right there. Okay. If you're not busy, can you make sure he finishes his meal? I mixed some medicine in it. He has to eat it all. -All you have to do is watch him. -Sure. -Thanks. -No problem. Make sure you eat it up. -See you. -Thanks again. No, I took the afternoon off. I'm going to see a doctor. My shoulders are so stiff. I'm thinking of getting a check-up. Okay. Honey, your skin is so smooth. -Oh, Kyung-ja. -Hyun-ji. What are you doing here? -I'm following someone. -Who? I'll tell you later. See you. Bye. Honey! Taxi! Honey! Why do you work out so hard in this heat? Is it so that you can scare away ghosts? Stop talking and leave. It's nice to work out together. What are you talking about? Stop bothering me and get off. You're so weak. Are you sure you're a man? This is why you always get beaten up. -I don't even weigh much. -Are you kidding me? Get off. Aren't you hungry? I'm hungry. Hey. Why don't we order some fried chicken? I'm craving fried chicken! Fried chicken! -Fried chicken! -Hey! Chicken! -Hey! -Catch me if you can! -You fool. -Hey! GAMPO INN -Gosh. Poor man. -I know. -I feel sorry for him. -Last night, another man died in that inn. -Do you mean Gampo Inn? -Yes. -I'm sure that inn is haunted. -You're right. What was her name? The girl who worked at the coffee shop. -Do you mean Eun-sil? -Right. Eun-sil. She was found dead in the closet in room number one. -I remember. -The pimp beat her to death. That's right. That's when people started to die in that room. That pimp was stabbed in that room, too. -It serves him right. -Exactly. Oh, my goodness. What are you doing? -Well... -Oh gosh. Where is this Gampo Inn you talk about? Go down that way. You scared me. -The heads taste best... -My goodness. on anchovies. -Who is that? -I have no idea. Why did he sneak up on us like that? -It's fine. -What's this place? It's fine. Why are you leaving? What a mess. I'm so sorry. That's all right. I'm okay. Are you Monk Myung-cheol? Yes. That's me. Why are you so late? Come in. My goodness. The energy in here is... I see. Someone must have died right here. -It was last night, right? -Yes. How did you know that? I heard you're not so good any... No, no. You're really amazing. There's always trouble with this room. The rumor is spreading. It's such a headache. Please. I'll leave it to you. All right. Let's see. -What's that? -Do you see something? I can sense strange energy. Right here... -I think it's a woman. -Yes. She has a grudge. Her name... Eun-sil? -Is it Eun-sil? -Eun-sil? Is she in there? Can you see her? It's not hard... to get rid of her, is it? It's simple. Just as a precaution... -please take a step back. -Okay. Lady! Call a shaman! Call a shaman! Lady! Lady! STAR ANIMAL CLINIC Are you just coming in? Who is this? Our new family. Give the dog some nourishing food. You're a little late. Yes. I had to drop by the school for this guy. What is that? Are we ready for surgery? -Yes. -I'll just go get changed. Okay. At this rate, we'll become an animal shelter instead of being a vet. We use more money on their food than what we earn. What if we lose our jobs? I agree. Come here. You're so cute. Where did you come from? Bong-pal, wait for me. Can I have one? Please. Give me a bite. Hey, look at that. Isn't it so cool? I want to go. Hey, did you just see that? It's going so fast. Can you make kimchi stew instead of bean paste stew? I have a knife in my hand. You better be quiet. Kimchi stew and rolled eggs, please? Go away. Go whine at home. Why are you bothering me? I have nowhere to go. I don't remember my home nor my mom. I don't even know why I died. That's why I steal food from other people's memorial services. Do you know how pathetic I feel stealing food like that? Sometimes I get bitten by dogs when I walk in. You feel sorry for me, right? Is this a new strategy? I don't feel sorry for you at all. Bong-pal. You really have to go now. He may be an old monk, but he used to be really talented before. He might harm you. Gosh. -I thought you went up a mountain. -No. Here you go. What happened to your face? It's nothing to worry about. I need to stay for a few more days. I sense strange energy. This must be it. I'm hungry. Let's eat. Sure. Sit down. You're not a kid. Who did you fight with? These sausages are delicious. Bong-pal. I really don't... want you to perform exorcism. You should stop. Will you lend me money then? I just need 900,000,000 won. Let's eat. Give me a sausage. -Where are you going? -I'm going to make more sausages. There's enough here. It's not for you. It's for the stray cats. It's fourth floor here. How can there be cats? There's a demanding stray cat here. Give me a lot. A lot. Yes. -What should we eat? -I'm excited. Doctor, we're leaving. -See you tomorrow. -Okay. Thanks for your work today. I'll finish up some stuff before leaving. You go on ahead. -Okay. Bye. -Sure. -Take care. -Okay. I'M LOOKING FOR A NEW FAMILY Hey, it's you from school. You're so adorable. What brings you here? I didn't know your hospital was here. -Do you live nearby? -Yes. Thank you about yesterday. Not a problem. It was nothing. I guess you haven't found a new owner for the dog. No. I hope it can find someone nice. Can you keep this place a secret from the students? Sure. Then I'll get going. Take care. Go away. Why is he sleeping like that? Is this Bong-pal? Are these his parents? Why does he live alone then? SEOUL CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION He's such a penny pincher. He's so meticulous. This is why he won't even give me a chance. How can I check if he won't give me the opportunity? A chance? Okay. Those are not lips. It's blood sausage. Don't! Don't do it! Gosh. It was a dream. It's just a dream. A dream... You scared me. What are you doing? What did you do to me? What? You little... Hey! That little... Did you step on me? It was the stray cat. The stray cat? It must be suffering from karma. Meow. Meow. Gosh. I'm really beaten up. This is going to last a while. Did he check it or not? Why isn't he replying? Bong-pal. Did you read the last letter from your dad? What did it say? -I don't know. -Didn't you read it? See what he wrote. -I threw it out. -Why did you throw it out? Aren't you curious about how he's doing? Not really. What a jerk. Why did he throw that out? Like father, like son. They're exactly the same. Excuse me. What are you doing? -I threw out something by mistake. -Are you stealing those boxes? No. We have a company we hired to come and collect them. You can't steal these. Boxes have been missing for days. -I'm not taking these. -I understand that life is tough. But you should work to earn money. Don't try to take the easy way out. I have a job. Also, I live in unit 402. He threw out something by mistake, so I'm here to retrieve it. How can you lie with a straight face? No one lives in unit 402. It's been empty for years. There's a tall and handsome guy that lives there. I lived in this apartment for ten years. Don't lie to me. Put that back and go away. Also, you should know you're going bald because you like free stuff. My goodness. -Why are you commenting on looks? -Then what should I talk about? -You shouldn't comment at all. -Seriously. I told you to leave that alone. -I just need to find a letter. -Stop trying to steal. -Leave it. -Stop saying that, why do you -say that? I'm innocent. -You look like a thief. -Put that down. -Wait. How dare you grab my hand? Gosh. I pushed you gently. Why did you fall? Who are you anyway? -The head of Residents' Committee. -I see. -Why did you yell while recycling? -Me? I never yelled. I just said that I live in unit 402. Did she leave? I'm just looking for it in this pile. -I don't see her. -I never saw him move in. He's been living here for years. -He should've come out to our-- -I told him to say hi to his neighbors. Bong-pal. -Hello. -Are you going to class? Yes. Microeconomics. That's Professor Kang's class. Professor Kang's difficult. Have fun in class and I'll see you in the next lecture. Okay. Bye. -Oh, thank you. -You're welcome. You must be in a good mood. I was until I saw you. What's wrong? I'm happy to see you. -I'm glad. Lucky you. -That's right. What a nerve. You're so shameless. -And also very pretty. -Yeah, right. With that face? Forget it. I need to study. Go away. I'm getting a little creeped out. He's mumbling, right? Yes. I think he can communicate with ghosts. Get lost. Yes. Hello? Yes, I'm Park Bong-pal. Yes. That's possible. Should I come by in about two hours? Okay. Bye. What is it? Why do you look so happy? -I'm going to work. Don't follow me. -I'm going to come. I said, don't follow me! Gosh. Don't follow me. Please. I'm begging you. Then will you do me a favor? Forget what I said. Cheon-sang. He was just talking to a ghost, right? Yes. I think so. I'm getting the chills, but I like that guy. -He can talk to them. -Let's go. He should fix this washing machine if it's broken. He needs to fix the doorbell, too. Why doesn't he fix anything? He's such a lazy guy. Where did I leave my scimitar anyway? Did Bong-pal take it with him? I doubt it. I have to get out of here. I have got to run. Oh my. Did I leave it there? My goodness. Darn it. GAMPO INN He's going in. Why is it always a spooky place like this? Should we take a pill before we start? Should we? -I mean... -Here. Let's go. You must be the exorcist. Was it really you on the phone? Yes, my name is Park Bong-pal. You look too young to be an exorcist. You must be a student. Are you sure you can do this? Buy some clothes. People don't trust you because of the way you dress. What? You can rest assured. Are you sure you won't run away after being paid like the monk yesterday? I don't know what to do with that useless monk! I'm different from those swindlers. Also, you can pay afterwards. Transfer the money when everything's done. All right. I like that. It's that room. Room number one. Thank you in advance. We're back. -Ghost Net. -Net. We're sorry we're airing this without any notice. An unprecedented exorcism show starts now. Follow me. What's that? What's wrong? Whatever. Let's just keep filming. Run away. Run away. Right now. Go in. Do you want to die? Go in. Gosh, it's even spookier at night. Why did I leave it behind and make myself come back here? Gosh. I should just go in. All right. I'm coming back tomorrow morning. There he is. Is he fighting with a ghost? Probably. -What is it? -It's fake. -Did they hire an actor? -He deserves an Oscar. What are they talking about? Look. It's not just for show. We're really filming a ghost live. So stop talking to us. We're scared to death. Look at that. Is he going to die? You're a dead man. -Are you okay? -Yes. -Are you? -Yes. I don't have it! Bong-pal! His side! Wait. She must have been wandering because of him. You've been nice today. You got rid of an evil ghost, and sent a nice one up. -Don't be shy. -Let's go. What is this doing here? Hey, both last time and this time, how did you find the ghosts' weaknesses? -Can you see it? -What if I say yes? Do you want me to teach you? -Yes, I do. -I don't want to. Why are you following me anyway? -Do you have feelings for me or-- -I don't. -Do you need my energy? -No. Why are you tailing me then? You're not my pet. I don't remember anything. What do you mean? What you told me earlier... Was that true? Yes. How I died, where my house is or who my parents are. I don't remember anything. But something popped up in my head for the first time in five years. When you and I... You know. You and me? What? You know what. When we did that, memories came back. That's why I tried to do that again, so that... What did we do? When? You know what I'm talking about. -Come on. What is it? -Gosh. Goodness. Forget it. I will help you. If you help me study, I'll pay back your ten million won. ANOTHER ABORTION? -That's my ID. -You posted many spiteful comments. Goodness. Don't come closer! No. Running to save a person in need. That's the real man. One million won per ghost? How did you get this? It wasn't me. It was Noh Hyun-joo. It's the first gift I got in five years. Of course, I'm happy. What is that monk? Is he always here? I'm sure she likes you. Excuse me. Gosh, where did I leave that scimitar? I can't remember. Drug packets? Did they die of drug overdose? Hey! Stop! Stay there and calm down! Hey! Who are you? -He's a monk. -I see.
