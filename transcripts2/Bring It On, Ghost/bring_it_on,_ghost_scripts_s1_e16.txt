 Good job. Let's go, Mr. Joo Hye-sung. Let's go. Monk. What is going to happen to Prof. Joo now? In some ways, he's a victim too. In our eyes, yes. But to normal people, he is just a murderer. An evil spirit took over his body because he had hatred in his heart at the start. You can't overlook that crime. Avalokitesvara. I'm going to go home and get some rest. You take Hyun-ji home. Yes. You went through a lot. Hyun-ji! Let me look at you! Are you okay? Did you get hurt? I'm okay. -Dad. -Let's go inside. Young man. I clearly told you that I do not like you seeing Hyun-ji. She was put in danger twice because of you. -What if she got hurt? -I'm sorry. Mom, stop. Bong-pal did nothing wrong. Go inside the house with your dad. Take her inside. -Mom. -Honey. Let's go, Hyun-ji. We're going to leave here tomorrow. If you have feelings for Hyun-ji, then end it here. It's best for both of you. I believe you understand me. Ma'am. Please give this to Hyun-ji. Please. Noh Hyun-joo. Kim Min-soo. Park Ji-hun. And Joo Jin-myung. Do you remember them? Mr. Joo Hye-sung. Yes. I remember. I killed them. I... ...killed all these people. Hye-sung. Hye-sung. -You're home. -Yes. Is it okay to drink when injured? There's no medicine for getting beaten by a ghost. Alcohol is the best to overcome the pain. There's no food either. Just wait a little bit. Thanks. Gosh, this looks good. Wow, You're really good at cooking soup. Is Hyun-ji leaving? Yes, she's leaving tomorrow. I see. It's time for everyone to go back to their normal lives. You must be sad. -No, I'm fine. -Good. It's not like distance is going to break you two apart, right? On days like this, let's drink up and go to bed. Oh goodness. This is nice. Why did you do it? I know it wasn't you. -Let's talk to the detective again... -I did it. The crimes I committed in my heart are bigger than the ones I physically did. If I didn't have any bad intentions. It wouldn't have happened. My hand... I killed those people in my heart. That fact will never change. -Hye-sung. -Please. Don't come here ever again. If you see my face... It will only give you pain. No, it's not true. I will come every day. I'll come and see you. I'm going to keep coming until you forgive me. I'm going to come even if you refuse to see me. I'm going to come every day to see you. What's Hyun-ji doing? -She's talking in her room. -With whom? -She shouldn't. -Leave her alone. It's the last time. I'm leaving today. Everything is packed already. Bong-pal. Please understand why Mom did that. I understand. Don't worry. -Thanks. -Study hard down there. -That way we'll be able to meet quickly. -I will. Hyun-ji, let's go. I have to go now. Hyun-ji, get in. Okay. I don't want to go. I want to be with you. I don't want to send you off either. Why aren't you here to see me? I don't know when we'll see each other again. -Don't you miss me? -I do miss you. But I'm afraid I won't be able to let you go if I see you. -Bong-pal. -Hyun-ji. I want you to get back to your normal life as soon as possible. I don't want that to be delayed because of me. We'll be apart for now. But we can always be together once you come to college. Once that happens, let's formally ask for your mother's permission to date. I know it'll be hard. But let's look forward to that day. Let's be patient and wait. Okay, I will. Take care of yourself until then. OZ LIBRARY Do know how to eat a ssam easily? Where's my phone? Hello? Yes, this is the 24-hour exorcism service, how may I help you? Chapter eight on conjunction. Conjunctions that introduce noun clauses. Turn to page eight. Number one, Coordinating conjunction.

Please enter the six digits of your birthday for Myeongseong University. HYUN-JI Hello? -Bong-pal. -What happened? I'm sorry. I didn't pass the exam. You didn't get in? That's okay, you can just do better next time. With that score, you'll pass for sure next time. Still, I wanted to go to school with you. You're graduating this year. Well, I'll sit this semester out. Forget it. Don't be ridiculous. You need to get a job right away. That way you can start planning for the future. That way... -That way what? -You know what I'm talking about. So what is it? -You really don't know? -I don't. Is that right? Then live alone forever. Why should I? I'm going to live with you. In four years. Why in four years? By then, I'll have a stable career. You'll be graduating about that time, so it's perfect. What do you say? Who said I'm going to live with you, huh? You're funny. Ah, when do classes start? March fifth. That's coming up soon. How am I going to wait another year? Time will go fast. -Welcome! -Hello! Come join our club! A price that doesn't honor the value of the property... It's not simple like this. Okay, that's all for class today. I want you to submit a group report next week on resource distribution. Quiet. Here are the designated groups. Take a look before you leave. Good job on your first day of class. See you next week. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Bong-pal. We're in the same group and we're counting on you. GROUP TWO PARK BONG-PAL -Okay, let's do our best. -Okay! See you next week. Hey, Bong-pal! Bong-pal, Bong-pal, Bong-pal! -Cheon-sang. -We're in trouble. -What happened? -We're in big trouble. What's wrong? You'll see. Cheon... Cheon-sang! PLEASE VACATE THE ROOM BY MARCH 31. In-rang is gone, Seo-yeon is gone, and not a single freshman is willing... What are we supposed to do now? Our club is in danger of being shut down again. -That's too bad, I guess. -"That's..." "That's too bad, I guess." We're in a crisis right now. How can the future president be so relaxed? Who's the future president? -Me? -Then who else would it be? It's just the two of us. Who else would it be? When I graduate, you'll be the president. I'm not really interested. So... the tradition and history we're so proud of... Are you saying you want to get rid of our Sundae gukbap club? I have a class. See you. Don't go. Be strong. Don't go, Bong-pal. Don't go, Bong-pal. Bong-pal, Bong-pal, Bong-pal! Bong-pal! You selfish bastard. IN-RANG Hello? What time is it? Why are you not here, yet? I'll be right there. Don't get annoyed. -Hurry up! Class is over! -Stop nagging. -Move it! -I'm coming! Exorcism is about getting rid of ghosts, evil spirits, and monsters that inhabit humans and places. It is a scary and dirty job. Shamans, monks, and the spiritually blessed have been exorcising for years. In 2018, Sundae gukbap has joined hands with these people... Excuse me. Do you have a question? I don't know where and what went wrong... ...but I need to ask now. Yes, please go ahead. Isn't this a restaurant? I wanted a bowl of it to go. -To go? -You can do that at most places. No... it's not. -Yes, we're... -Gosh, I'm so sorry! -I don't know what's gotten into me. -Yes, sorry. -I'm sorry. -No, I'm sorry. -I'm truly sorry. -Not at all. I'm sorry. -I should've been more clear. Goodbye. -Yes, goodbye. -Goodbye. -This is not a restaurant. All right. Did you get work for us? Our name is Sundae gukbap, so he came to eat. What time is it right now? Why are you lazy lately? Did you pass out the flyers? Yes, I did. But I think we need to hire a part-timer. It's hard for one person. A part-timer? How can that just easily come out of your mouth? We haven't had a single job since we opened up our business! And wait a minute. Look at this. I see that you ate a special variety meat set yesterday. I told you to cut off meals at 5,500 won! 5,500 won meals are hard to find. I just ate one for 5,000 won! We'll never be able to pay my grandma back at this rate! I got this investment because I believed in you! -You said it would be a hit! -You said we could pay it all back -in a month. -The thing is... If you look at the way the economy is doing these days... What about new freshman recruits? We're still... Still? We received a grant from the school and we still have no new members? We're going to jail if the school finds out. Look, I'm doing my very best. -Let's clean this place up. -Let's do some cleaning. Let's clean the windows and dust the office. I have a headache, so I'll take a break. -Clean? -Go ahead and start. You want me to clean? I'm the CEO. I have to do all the dirty work just because you got the investment money. I guess you deserve to order me. -Do we have coffee? -Yes, we do. -How do you want it? -Just get me a latte. -Goodness, it's been a long time. -Yes, Monk Myung-cheol. I hope I'm not late. The thing is, I've been trying to get a hold of you but you didn't pick up. Is there something going on? The bodhisattva has told us that your prayers and energy have no effect at all. Which bodhisattva is going around saying such nonsense about me? What do you mean nonsense? Why are you here? Why can't you cross over to the afterlife? Believe in me. Redeem your sorry soul! Who is this pitiful-looking man? Get rid of him. What is this? She's the 1000-year-old Virgin Bodhisattva from Mount Gyeryong. A virgin bodhisattva? Why are there so many? She's not a virgin bodhisattva! She's just a con artist! You insolent fool! Leave immediately! You have no credentials or pedigree! How dare you con these good people! How dare you call me a fraud! How can you let this fake monk into the house! What? I'm a famous monk that performs exorcisms. Leave if you're done! How dare you impersonate a bodhisattva. How rude. What? Rude? -Oh my. -What's wrong? What is going on? Have you lost your mind? Oh. Salute! Congratulations on your promotion. Stop, you're embarrassing me. Chief. Chief. Why did you push her? I didn't push her. She fell by herself while running around like a maniac. She says she's a virgin bodhisattva, Please check and see. I think this woman is a fraud. Why do you keep hitting me, woman? Stop her! She's attacking me! Calm down! Have we met before? You look familiar. I go to church. -Hallelujah? -Amen. Look at her. Her eyes are mad. -Bong-pal. -Bong-pal. Where are you going? -I'm going home. -Don't go home. There's the freshman welcome party today. -I'm not interested in those events. -No, you have to go. You have to be there. -Please go. -Let's go together. Bong-pal, let's go. Let's go. Did everyone get a glass? Did you or not? -We did! -It's rare to drink with us seniors! On three, we'll say, "Go, Economics!" -Yes! -One, two, three! -Go, Economics! -Go, Economics! From now on... There's a really pretty freshman. I saw her too. She's totally hot. Hello. I'm a freshman, Kim Ji-eun. Please take good care of me. Hello. I'm a fresh... I'm a freshman. -She's so cute. -Moon Soo-jin. Please take good care of me. Hello. I'm a freshman, Lee Dong-min. It's my goal to become the Adam Smith of Korea. Thank you. Hello, seniors. I'm a freshman, Kim Hyun-ji. I'd appreciate your guidance. Hey, she's the one! -I have a question. -Yes? Do you have a boyfriend? Yes, he's here. He's here? Why did you lie about not passing? I did it on purpose so I could surprise you. I didn't even know. I was worried how I'd wait another year. You said a year is nothing. I didn't mean it. By the way... -where are you staying? -At my uncle's. - It's close to your place too. - Really? Good. -Aren't you happy to see me? -Of course. From now on, I'm going to stick to you like glue. You better listen to me from now on. -Listen to you? -Yes. I'm older than you. You're one year younger than me. No way. Let's get the nicknames out of the way. Bong-pal, repeat after me. Older sister. No. You better listen to me. One more time. "Older sister." -Forget it. -Why? Just say it once, okay? Older sister. Older sister. -I don't want to! -Say it! -No! -Just say it this once. Please? Now go in. Okay. -Good night. -Good night. -What's the matter? -I'm just too happy. I'm happy, too. -Go in now. -All right. -Sweet dreams. -You too. Hi, Monk Myung-cheol. Hello. The monk... Bong-pal. I'm sorry. Gosh, you're not a kid. How could you get into a fight, huh? There are ethics in this industry. She was not ethical. That's why I... taught her a lesson. Thank you. I will go now. Monk Myung-cheol. -Yes? -Well... You're not well and all. Why don't you stop working? Stop working and stay with me. -With you? -Yes. It's inconvenient to live in the mountains. I emptied the spare room. Just move in. Don't bother going back and forth. Bong-pal. You're the only family member I have now. You know how to make people cry. Do you have sausages at home? Today's a good day for sausages and soju. Let's go. What's wrong? Hyun-ji! Hey, Soo-jin. Do you have time tonight? What? What about tonight? We're having a blind date with guys from the Business School. -Can you come with us? -A blind date? Well, you know I have a boyfriend. We know that you're going out with one of our seniors. Can you keep this from him and come out with us this once? We were afraid the guys would be a disaster. So we told them we'd bring the prettiest girl in our department. They said that they will come with the most handsome guys as well. Come on, me the prettiest girl? If Bong-pal finds out, he will get really mad. Once people know you two are going out you will never be asked on a blind date. You got into college and will graduate without being on a blind date? Wow, she is really pretty. With the other two, she looks even prettier. Amazing. Hello, I'm a freshman in the Business school, Kim Tae-yoon. You're as pretty as we've heard. Really? Thank you. What is this? You told me that you will bring three guys. They all begged me to come along. We managed to cut many others. Here. Thank you. MY LOVE BONG BONG MY LOVE BONG BONG Your call is being redirected... I'm done with my class. Where are you? I'm discussing homework with my classmates at a cafe. -I will call you later. - Let's break the ice, shall we? Let's introduce each other first. -Okay. -All right. -Sure. -Me first? I'M DISCUSSING HOMEWORK WITH MY CLASSMATES AT A CAFE. Homework? I should go home, then. Drink up! Drink up! Alcohol is coming. Drink up! It will make you want to dance. This is Soo-jin's favorite game. -Game starts. -Game starts. -Bunny, bunny. -Bunny, bunny. -Carrot, car... -She did it wrong. -A knight to the rescue. -A knight to the rescue. -A knight to the rescue. -No. I can drink this. -No way. -I will drink it. I'm the knight for you! This is Hyun-ji's favorite game. Game starts. -Bunny, bunny. -Bunny, bunny. -Bunny, bunny. -Carrot, carrot. Carrot, carrot. Carrot, car... WE'RE ON A BLIND DATE WITH GIRLS FROM THE ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT. Hello, In-rang. Hi, Pal. Where are you now? -I'm at home. -Are you? Do you happen to know where Hyun-ji is? Hyun-ji? -She said she's at a cafe doing homework. -Ah, she's doing her homework... Pal, do you want to take a look at the video I'm sending now? Sure. This is Hyun-ji's favorite game. Game starts. -Bunny, bunny. -Bunny, bunny. -Bunny, bunny. -Bunny, bunny. -Bunny, bunny. -Carrot, carrot. Here we go. You two look like a couple. -Don't we? -Let's go for the second round. Did you two already decide? -Hyun-ji. -Yes? What? Bong-pal. -By the way, who is this? -Me? Hyun-ji's boyfriend. Bong-pal, are you really mad? I always wanted to go on a blind date at college. Can you let it go this once, please? You have a boyfriend. How can you go on a blind date? -I told them that I had a boyfriend. -What? I told them that I have a boyfriend. If you don't trust me, go ask them. I just went there to feel the craziness of college life. -You got into college for this, did you? -Yes. Why else? -Oh my. -I was kidding. It took me seven years to become a college student. I'm just loving it. I want to try everything I haven't done before. So please don't be mad, Bong-pal. Bong-pal. Bong Bong. Bong-pal, please... I'm so sorry that I'm turning cute... -Gosh. -You laughed, didn't you? -I did not laugh. -Yes, you did. -I did not laugh. -Come on, you so laughed. -Hey, you laughed. -No, I did not. I hate to say goodbye. Me too. Sweetie, where are you? I'm up in Seoul now. Come home early. My mom must be here. -Bong-pal, just go. -What? If my mom sees you, she might say something. -Get home safe. I will go. -Hyun-ji. Hey, what are you doing? Bong-pal, hold on. Bong-pal. Hello. Hello... I heard you came up to Seoul. I wanted to come by to say hi. Ah, did you? Why don't you come in? By the way, isn't it too late for you to hang out at this hour? Mom, don't be mean to Bong-pal. Do you want to say something? I have a feeling that you didn't just come by to say hi... Well, ma'am... Well... Hyun-ji and I... We'd like to get your permission to go out officially. Well, haven't you two been going out without my permission all this time? No, we haven't seen each other all this time. Be quiet. Are you sincerely asking for my permission? -Yes. -Then... If I tell you not to see her will you never see her again? Mom. Honestly, I didn't have a good feeling about you from the beginning. You suddenly appeared... ...and stayed close to my daughter who just woke up from a coma. What parents wouldn't be suspicious to accept you? I understand. Mom, are you serious? -You mean it, right? -Yes. You got into college and are all grown up now. How can I possibly stop you? Well, he doesn't seem like a bad boy. Of course not. He's really nice. Plus, he does so well in school. He has a full scholarship for all four years. He's even athletic. -You like him that much? -Yes, I do. Thank you, Mom. I love you. What are you doing? -You're too big for this. Oh my. -Why? Today, Detective Yang went out of her way to make this. Try. Excuse me, officer. Thank you. I made it when we had time for crafts. If you don't like it, you don't have to wear it. Why wouldn't I like it? It's so pretty. It took me so long... ...to come here. I'm sorry, Hye-sung. Don't blame yourself anymore. Now... I am not angry or resentful anymore. Although we couldn't turn back time... let's try to make up... ...for the lost time. Let's do that, Hye-sung. I will. Mother. Give me that. See you later. Sure, have a good day. I'm not picking this up. -I'm here to throw this away. -I didn't say anything. I guess something is bothering you. What? Oh my! I see you have a face for good fortune. Um, do I? You shouldn't get injured at your age. Be careful. Thank you. Oh my goodness. Come on. I'm so out of your league. Well, he has an eye for beauty, I guess. Oh my. Oh my, I'm sorry. It's okay. Here. Wait. Haven't we met before? Do you know me? Se-ri! -Se-ri. -Hon, what took you so long? I've been waiting for so long. I can't go out with someone who isn't punctual. You're mad, aren't you? I'm very sorry. I won't be late again. Give it to me. Honey! What is this guy doing here again? I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. Please forgive me this once. Why are you so clingy? So irritating. I told you that we were done. Why are you doing this? Se-ri doesn't want you. Because of you, she's changed. Why did you come on to her, huh? What do you mean I came on to her? Be a man and get lost, will you? -Honey. -Se-ri. -Bong-pal. -Seo-yeon. -Long time no see. -It sure has been. I heard you got a job... at a nice company. Well, I'm just an intern. Why are you here? -I needed to get some academic papers. -Academic papers? Honey, what are you doing here? -You're the one from last time... -Hi, I'm his girlfriend. Ah, you have a girlfriend now, huh? -Congratulations. -Thanks. -You two look good. -Thank you. -I will see you later. -See you later. What was that about? Don't smile like that. -You look like a fool. -I didn't. By the way, can you call me that again? I don't want to. Hey, please. Hey, call me by that name again. Aren't you late for your class? I'm late. Excuse me. Sorry. Honey, pay attention in your class. Why is there so much pork? I hate it. I like the jjigae with tuna in it. Kimchi-jjigae is better with pork in it. I agree. Isn't it? That was an insult to pork kimchi-jjigae. Pork kimchi-jjigae is the best kimchi-jjigae. Don't you think? When the juice from the pork meets sour and spicy kimchi, it gives the jjigae deep flavor. She doesn't know that, huh? Exactly. Why would she throw away such good stuff? You seem to know about deep meat flavor, huh? Not many around our age do, don't you think? I'm Goo Dae-yeong, a sophomore in the Physical Education department. -Nice to meet you. -Hello. I haven't seen your pretty face around here. You must be a freshman. -I am. -A freshman, huh? Did you join any clubs yet? -Not yet. -Not yet? -Why don't you join our club then? -What kind of club is it? It's a club we work together to learn new flavors. It's called 'Let's Eat.' Among the nessecities of life, food means more than just feeding ourselves. It not only satisfies our desire to feed ourselves but also helps with stress from social lives and loneliness from isolation. So our club is sort of promoting the pleasure of dining together. -Doesn't it sound fun? -No, it doesn't. -Hello, sir. -How dare you? You just got up in the middle of trying to sell medicine? -I'm sorry. -Plus, you punk... You can't recruit people at a sacred place like the cafeteria. Where are your ethics? -I'm sorry. -Go over there and stay. You're bothering Hyun-ji. Please enjoy your lunch. Ones who are so smooth with words are not to be trusted. Hyun-ji. You shouldn't be fooled into a club by someone like him. Don't worry. In-rang graduated, but why are you still here? You should watch what you say. It's top secret. Actually, do you have time after lunch? I have something to tell you. LIFE AND SUNDAE GUKBAP The lady that is currently in attendance... ...has been granted a very nice and fantastic opportunity. Now your life will be different from before you joined Sundae gukbap... ...and after. Kim In-rang. These are the light refreshments we prepared. I hope you enjoy them. Here we go again. By the way, Cheon-sang isn't a student, is he? Isn't he a scam artist? By promoting academic-industrial collaboration we, Sundae gukbap, contribute to local and national development and lead innovative cultural tradition. In doing so, we'd like to contribute to your bright future. Once you join our Sundae gukbap... -No need to listen anymore. Let's go. -Top-notch multi-communication. We provide speedy and accurate service. We provide 24-hour exorcism services. We can do it all. Where... Hey... Hey guys, Bong-pal. How could you just leave? We still have part two. I'm not going to join any clubs. -Why not? -I've to study hard and graduate. Gosh. Isn't this too harsh? You don't want to be the president or even join the club? Then we might as well just forget the club and only work together. We couldn't do any work without you two. Bong-pal, Hyun-ji. We're begging you this once. If our business goes bankrupt I will owe my grandma so much and she will break his arms and legs. She will. Please save my limbs. If we work together we could really hit a jackpot. Cheon-sang, it's just that... I don't need money anymore. Me neither. Guys, it's not about money, you know. You need to keep in mind that we're not doing this to make money, right? Have you forgotten the sacred idea of Sundae gukbap? Like a pot that is boiling 24 hours at a gukbap restaurant let's try to help those who are suffering. How will that be like? Did you already forget our promise? Bong-pal. Hyun-ji. Your power comes with great responsibilities. Will you really let your power go to waste? Do you know how many kids are waiting to be rescued? Hold on. Hello, this is 24-hour exorcism service, Sundae gukbap. I'm a counsellor, Kim In-rang. How may I help you? A ghost? A ghost? A ghost? A ghost? Are you hurt? Calm down. Take a big breath. Where are you at? I will come right over. I understand. All right then. What do we do? These people's cry. We can shine some light on their misery. Let's do it together. -Let's go, please. -Please. -Someone is hurt. -Come with us. Bong-pal. Yes? What Cheon-sang was saying isn't entirely wrong. What do you mean? It's hard to see ghosts. But we can help them at the same time. Why would you want to help ghosts? Aren't they the same as us? They haven't crossed over to the other side and are just lost right now. Think about it. Not all ghosts are bad. They're... ...hurt and broken just like us. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Monk Myung-cheol. -Yes? Why do you... ...perform exorcism? It's a tough job, but doesn't pay much. I help the ghosts get over their grudges in this world. I help people to get rid of their fears. That way, everybody finds their way back. They go back to the places where they belong. That's why. Do you think I can do the job? Bong-pal. Do you know why I was against you performing exorcism? Not sure. It was because I could see hatred in your eyes then. You can't see the world right when you have so much anger in you. You were hurt by ghosts. But not all ghosts are bad. In a way, we should feel sorry for them. Are you asking if you can do the job? It's up to you what you think. Making others happy makes you happiest. If your eyes can give the dead ones peace you're not cursed, but you have a special gift. By the way, it's so unlike you that you're saying all good things. When do I ever say bad things, punk? -I think this is your first time. -What? Finish your food. Ah, it's so good. This is really nice. How long has it been? Seriously, how long has it been? I love going together like this! Hyun-ji. Bong-pal. Let's be together forever. Forever! Let's go! Bong-pal. Yes? Why did you change your mind so suddenly? -I want to know. -Know what? The reason why we can see ghosts. Let's go. -Bring it on! -Bring it on! -Ghosts! -Ghosts! Subtitle translation by
