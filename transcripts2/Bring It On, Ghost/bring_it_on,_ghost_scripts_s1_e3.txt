 She's not the first to fool me. It's so annoying. Let me see. I forgot to stop by a grocery store. It's all because of that mad ghost. Where did Monk Myung-cheol go? She's really nowhere in sight. You'll see what happens if you ever show up again. LOOKING FOR A NEW OWNER You're still here. Where is my honey? He must be here inside the campus. Honey! Honey! Where are you? Honey! Hello, Hyun-ji. -Where have you been? -I was looking for my honey. -Your honey? -Yes. I finally found my ideal guy in 30 years. -I'll be following him forever. -Did you change your target again? Wasn't the last one your ideal guy you found in 30 years? I'm serious this time. He's so tall, has such glowing skin... and he smiled at me with his puppy eyes. It made my heart flutter. Moreover, he has broad shoulders. What a perfect guy to cling on to. I see. What's the matter with you? Did something happen? The thing is... Really? Were the plump and soft thing you bumped into last time his lips, not blood sausage? That's right. Oh, my goodness. I'm so jealous. Anyway, you kissed him again. You remember anything? -No. Nothing at all. -Nothing? -Nothing at all? -No. I don't know why. Last time, I did remember something. That's strange. What should I do now? Did you believe that? Who are you looking for? Were you looking for me? We didn't see each other for a day. Aren't you happy to see me? I'm very happy to see you. -What? You're scaring me. -What? You really don't know? You're not only selfish but also shameless! Forget it. What was I expecting from a ghost? Latch onto him. Who knows if it'll bring your memories back? He goes to a prestigious college. Ask him to help you with preparation for the college entrance exam. Try everything you can. There's something about him. Bong-pal, let me go with you. Bong-pal. How have you been? -Good afternoon. -What brings you here? Well, Professor... It's about the dog. The one you rescued. -Okay. -Could I adopt him? Sure. That'd be great. We haven't found him a family yet. I actually saw him at the hospital on my way here. I can't take him off my mind. I see. Can you stop by after class today? You can come around three p.m. Okay. Thank you. It's his lucky day today. I'm looking forward to it. A love is leaving me Yet again Hey. Aren't you going to talk to me again? I can help you. Answer me. -Give it to me. -If you stop being angry at me. -Give it to me. -No. Hey. Wait for me. Why are you latching onto me? I'll help you with exorcising ghosts. Do you think I'll trust a ghost again? Why can't you? I'm a very trustworthy ghost. I know you're going to try to hit on me again by lying that it'd bring your memories back. I wasn't lying. Then did your memories come back? Not really. See? You should never trust female ghosts. Last time, they did. But not this time. That's all. I wasn't hitting on you. Trust me. -You'll trust me, won't you? -If I do, then what? Your memories didn't come back. Why would you want to help me? Well... Help me with preparation for the college entrance exam. -College entrance exam? -Yes. You must have been a very good student. Why would a ghost study for the exam? Although I don't remember well, I'm guessing... I'm wandering here because I couldn't take the exam. I'm hoping, if I get a good result, I'll ascend. Can't you help me? It can't be that difficult. If you help me, I'll pay back the 10,000,000 won I owe you. Deduct two million won every time I help you. What do you say? -I get paid only one million per case. -What about 800,000 won? Five hundred thousand per case. Take it or leave it. Hey, that'd be great. Five hundred thousand per case. Deal. Wait for me! You've been stuck here since last night. Stop it already. It'll do you no good to get on Sadako's nerves. He can be totally mean. He raided our page the other day. Yes, he did. Aren't you my friend? Aren't you supposed to help me? Go study and win a scholarship. We can't let Sadako get away like this. We should teach him a lesson. In addition to insulting me during our shows, now he's... humiliating me, even on here. You're dead meat. I'm sure he's the one who uploaded that video clip. Die, Sadako! It used to be two for one. I guess the promotion ended. -What are you doing? -I put a toothbrush in your cart. I saw it, but why? To live with you, I'll need one at your place. Who said you'll live with me? -Put it back. -Why? We're a team now. We need some camp training. I'm never going to live with a ghost. Do you expect me to go back and forth every day? It'd be more convenient to live together, don't you think? I have nowhere to go anyway. Please. Then, since I'll be providing you with food and shelter, -I'll deduct 250,000 won per case. -Two hundred fifty thousand? When will I pay off ten million won by doing that? -Take it or leave it. -Fine. Deal. MACKEREL -Excuse me. -Yes. I'll take a mackerel. -Thank you. -Thank you. Bong-pal. Let's have some meat. Let's eat meat! -Dream on. -It's been a long time. -Should we buy meat for a stew? -No. -Yes. -No. No way. -Put it down. -No. -Put it down. -No. Put it down! We're having meat! -I'm going to eat it all. -Are you happy? I'm going to go bankrupt. You'll eat some of it, too. Hey. Bong-pal. Can't you buy me that dress? To celebrate our teaming up. No way. I think that'll look great on me. Don't you think so? I don't. I think it'll look terrible on you. That's impossible. Take a good look. What do you think? Don't I look pretty? My goodness. Hey. Buy me that dress. He always leaves me behind. Wait for me. STAR ANIMAL CLINIC The inflammation in his eyes got a lot better. You can come back just once a week now. -Okay. -Just a second. Twice a day, during his breakfast and dinner. Give this to him twice a day. -I see. -It's time to say goodbye. All right. Goodbye. -Here. -Thanks. -All right. Try holding him. -Come here. -Isn't it pretty? -Why? What's wrong? Have you named the dog yet? Why are all the girls around him so pretty? -I must admit she is pretty. -Hey. One-sided love always breaks your heart. -How about a drink after work? -Really? -It's on you, right? -Me? What is that? Cheon-sang? Are you okay? -Lara is dead. -Lara? It didn't even get to use magic. That Sadako jerk... I see. -It was fun, dumbass. -Dumb what? You're driving me mad. You deserve it because you're so bad. Your gameplay is as bad as your broadcasting. -Where are you now? -Why? Will you come to my place? Find me if you can. Stop making a fuss from now on. You must be really thoughtless, or hopeless at this game. Or maybe both, I guess. Miz, a famous idol singer, has been found dead in her own studio. She is said to have recorded herself while committing suicide. What? What is it? Gosh. What's going on? No, go away! Can't you just buy me a dress? I bought you a toothbrush and meat. And now you're asking for a dress. -Do I look like a pushover? -No, I didn't mean that. Look. I wore this uniform for five years. It's so worn out. Even my skirt's hemline is coming apart. Then what about ghosts that died hundreds of years ago? Have you not seen virgin ghosts' clothes? It's so dirty and it stinks too! Why would a ghost need clothes? Can you even wear it if I buy you one? Of course. You just need to burn it. Haven't you seen people doing it? Do you want me to buy a new dress and burn it? -Yes. -Are you crazy? -What are you doing? -I'm looking at my stuff. And what's that face? -Why are you so happy? -Because I am. About what? -Are you happy to see those? -Yes. It's the first gift I got in five years. Of course, I'm happy. You call that a gift? I never receive anything since I don't remember who to go to. That's the first gift I've ever received since my death. Do ghosts brush their teeth? Why wouldn't we? Come on. I'm a hygiene freak. You said you haven't received anything in the last five years. It means you never brushed your teeth for five years. That's hygienic. The more meat you put in, the tastier it gets. Put more in. I put enough. I'm the one cooking here... so stay quiet. It looks so delicious. Bong-pal. Bong-pal! Bong-pal! Where have you been? I've been looking for something. Why is that there? What are you talking about? That one. I've been looking for it all day long. -Did you take it out with you? -Why would I take that? -It was there since yesterday. -Yesterday? Am I getting old? It smells great. Let's eat. Okay. Take a seat. What's gotten into you? You cooked meat. -Is that to invigorate me? -Help yourself. You know how to act nice. So nice. That was a good meal. I feel stuffed. That was a nice meal. -Where's my meat? -I am so sorry. Does he always live here? Not always. A night or two every month. Bong-pal. What is this toothbrush? -That's my toothbrush. -Is this for me? Why did you choose this color? It's pink. That's mine. What's wrong with that monk? Thank you. No! It's so annoying. I hope you fall down and hurt yourself. Gosh. Did I just break my arm? Did I eat too much? My back hurts. You deserve it. Anyway, where should I sleep tonight? Why does he always sleep like that? This bed is so soft. It's so nice. I can't remember the last time I slept on a bed. That's better. Bong-pal, why did you sleep out here last night instead of your room? Oh, it was too hot. -Why would you hug me if it's so hot? -When did I do that? Hold on... Did you... miss being in my arms? What's wrong with you? You're gross. That's right. People should live together. Where are you going without breakfast? I have to go to Icheon for work. Eat your breakfast. I'll see you on your mom's memorial day. -Memorial day? -Bong-pal. Please don't perform exorcism. Especially virgin ghosts. If you see them, don't go close to them. They mean trouble. They're evil. Okay? Yes, I know. -Don't just say it. You have to mean it. -All right. I can sense this strange energy. Do you see anything? No, I don't see anything. Take care of yourself. I'm going. -Bye. -Bye. Does he think all ghosts are bad? There are tons of good ghosts like me. He doesn't watch what he says. I don't like him at all. Bong-pal, when are we eating? How can you ask for food when you just woke up? Hey. Let's rewrite our contract. What? Why? I said I'd provide food and accommodation, but I don't think I can manage looking at how much you eat. -So... -So? Let's make it 200,000 won instead of 250,000 per case. Come on, I don't eat that much. Look for yourself. How can you eat half a week's worth of food in a day? -Don't you think you're too much? -Gosh. I didn't eat that much. You did. Don't be so cheap. I have to eat well to perform exorcism. We didn't even start working yet. What? Do you want to terminate the contract? You're so cheap. Fine! Give me more. All right. I'm so full. Where are you going? -Why do you ask? -I want to come along. No thanks. We live together, but let's not get involved in each other's private lives. Sadako, that psycho. I'll slap him in the face. -He's dead meat. -It's here. The address is right here. Are you sure it's okay to show up like this? I heard he used to learn martial arts before. It's all a lie. I'll slap that psycho Sadako's face. Three hundred seven, 300... Hey, I'm here. Sadako! It's me, Blackstar BJ 1004. He has cold feet. Gosh. This guy... Move it! He was famous for posting bad comments online. Many people filed for complaints. He was also being sued by Miz. The idol singer who killed herself? Yes. Coming through. Please move out of the way. Who are they? They're the ones who reported. They found him when they came to fight in person. -What? -They wanted to fight in real life -after playing games together? -Yes. You guys are from Myeongseong University? I see a lot of students from there these days. He was from the same university as well. Sadako hacked your ID and you went over in a fury after chatting with him? Yes. You were upset, so you killed him, huh? -Yes. -What? No. He was already dead when we got there. Right? Right. We didn't do anything. -Really? -Yes. We checked the security camera in front of the building, and these guys arrived after he was dead. We did their background checks. However, you should take a look at this. What is it? It's hateful comments written about Miz. Why are there so many? This is just from last month. Gosh. CRAZY WOMAN! PUSH OFF! There are so many insults. They say words can kill. How horrible. Who would want to live after reading all this? What did you want me to see anyway? Look at the IDs that left hateful comments. The one with the most comments is Sadako, Yang Hee-soo, who died today. The manager of the anti-community, Kim Kyung-ho worte second most. I just received a call from Gangseo Police that he died. All ten of his fingers were broken, just like Hee-soo. The next one in line is "Office Worker." Now, look at this ID. BLACKSTAR BJ 1004 How do you even read that? Starshape, BJ 1004? It's Blackstar BJ 1004. That... That's me. You wrote a lot of bad comments. No, that's not me. I told you earlier. My ID was hacked. It's all posted by Sadako. I didn't post them. I swear. A female idol singer, who recently took her own life a few days ago, was said to have recorded herself in a suicide video causing shock to many. This video has been widely spread over the internet and social media. Who or how this video has been distributed is currently unknown. The police are in a state of confusion. Sadako's death can't be related to Miz, right? The detectives told me to call them if something happens. Why did they say that? I don't feel good about it. -What are you doing? -Hey, look at this. This is an anti-Miz community. Sadako died after leaving insulting comments about Miz. The head of the community died, too. I saw on the news that his fingers were broken. Is this Miz's curse? Be careful, whoever wrote nasty comments. Office Worker better be careful, too. No way. That's impossible. I was a huge fan of Miz. What's going to happen to me? Will a ghost attack me? That's absurd. -Hey. -Gosh. I should visit my hometown. What are you talking about? You were born in Seoul. Apparently, I was mistaken. According to my mom, I was born in a town farthest down in South Gyeongsang Province, called Jecheon. Jecheon is in North Chungcheong Province. What's up with you? I'm scared to death. ANTI-MIZ COMMUNITY MIZ'S SUICIDE VIDEO -Oh, my. -What's going on? That crazy woman. She's craving attention even when she's dead. I LOVE BROCCOLI SALAD. I'M CRAVING IT. MIZ'S SUICIDE VIDEO Did you have to follow me to my school? Isn't this fun? I don't go to school for you to have fun. You don't have to care about me. Also, if I ascend after the exam, I won't get to enjoy college life. -Don't you feel sorry for me? -That's enough. I should stop talking to you at all. -You're all talk. -No, I'm not. The lectures are too long. I'm starving. Why don't we eat something first? Did you starve to death? You're hungry all the time. Maybe I did starve to death. Wait. It's her. Oh, my. Look at your face. You should ask her if she wants to have lunch with you. You're being ridiculous. Let's go. -Hey! -Bong-pal. See you. -Hello. -Invite her to lunch. Is your class over? -That's right. -"That's right"? You just sounded so lame. -I see. I'll see you around. -Wait, Seo-yeon. There you go. -Well... -Say it. -Lunch... -What about it? Enjoy your lunch. Thanks. You too. -See you. -See you. What was that? "Enjoy your lunch." How are you going to get a girlfriend? -Be quiet. -"Be quiet." -Stop it. -"Stop it." -Do you have a death wish? -I'm already dead. Too bad. Hey! Professor. -Hi, Seo-yeon. -Hello. -How's the dog doing? -Well, he's doing fine, -but he doesn't eat much. -He doesn't? He might need some time to get used to the new environment. Should I take a look? Thank you. When would be convenient for you? I'm available in the afternoon both today and tomorrow. I see. I'll stop by tomorrow. Sure. See you then. You shouldn't feed cats here. I was wondering who was feeding the cats. It was you. Hello, Professor. They're veterinary school buildings. Wild animals should be kept out. You shouldn't feed animals around here. I'm sorry. The cat seemed to be starving. Please do it around that corner next time. -Sorry? -The security patrols here often. No one will see you around that corner. No one really passes by there. I see. By the way, this cat must have given birth recently. I saw kittens around here. If she gave birth, what should I feed her? She will love shredded chicken breast or beef. By the way, I should check her condition first. Let me see. Are you okay? Yes. I'm okay. She's very violent. "The highest and deepest truth is hard to find in thousand years. REST IN PEACE Fortunately, I encountered it now and understand Buddha's teachings. Once upon a time, Buddha sojourned in Anathapindika's Park by Shravasti with a great company of Bhikshus, even 1250." I keep forgetting this. Let's see. "The highest and deepest truth is hard to find in thousand years." This is Buddha's mercy. Here I go. Let me begin. "The highest and deepest truth is hard to find in thousand years. Fortunately, I encountered it now and understand Buddha's teachings. Once upon a time--" ACUPUNCTURIST I'm sorry. The way we pray has changed a lot. Let me answer the phone. What bad timing. Hello. Hold on. Give me just one second. 345, Kyunghwa-ro, Yangju, Gangwon Province. Park Ji-hoon. I'm asking you because I can't be there. It's near your clinic. Find out what he's up to. I haven't heard from him in months. He's Bong-pal's father. Okay. Bye. Buddha's mercy. Hey, you shouldn't be just watching her like this. Ask her out. What? Don't you have the courage? Should I help you? Forget it. If you want to help me, don't do anything. Bong-pal. -What? -Bong-pal. -I'm not interested in your club. -That's not it. Can you help Cheon-sang? Please save me... I need a sedative. Why is In-rang taking so long? The thing is... Do you know the singer, Miz? She died, and Cheon-sang left hateful comments... No. There's a guy named Sadako. He hacked Cheon-sang's ID... and then... Cheon-sang is... It's Cheon-sang. Hello? I'm seeing Bong-pal right now. Cheon-sang? -Hello? -Hey. -In-rang? -Cheon-sang? Cheon-sang! We have to go now. -What? -Right now! -Where? -We have to go right now. We have to go save Cheon-sang! Please save me. Mom, your son is going to die! No! Stop it, please. Nothing will change even if you kill them. All I wanted was for people to compliment me. Why does everyone hate me? Why do they hate me? You're the one that hates yourself the most! Nothing will change no matter how many people you kill. Shut it. You don't know anything. You know nothing. -Are you all right? -Yes. You're the one that hates yourself the most! How can anyone love you when you don't even love yourself? Cheon-sang! Cheon-sang! Cheon-sang! Cheon-sang! What are we going to do? This is so tiring. I... I can't walk any more. I'll wait for you at home. I never thought I'd be jealous of a ghost. What are you doing? You said you'd go first. Why are you here? I don't know. Maybe it's because I'm tired. I can't teleport properly. Let me try again. Gosh, you scared me. What was that? Aren't you going home? I don't know. Other ghosts can do it so well. How come it doesn't work so well for me? I wore this uniform for five years. It's so worn out. Even my skirt's hemline is coming apart. -Good work today. -I know, I did so great. Good job. Good work, Hyun-ji. Why did I even bother? Since I worked so hard, can we have meat today? I didn't get any last time. Fine. I shouldn't have asked such a cheap guy like you. -All right. Let's have meat. -Really? -I'll go get some. Wait for me inside. -Are you serious? Awesome! I'm super hungry, so make sure you hurry up. Hurry back, okay? I thought you said you were hungry. Bong-pal. Are you all right? Cheon-sang. Cheon-sang. Am I still alive? Yes, you're alive. You're alive. You still have all ten fingers. You have them all. You're alive. You have them. You have them all. Everything is all right. STAR ANIMAL CLINIC The x-rays are fine. -Have a good night. -Good night, Doctor. Is it time already? Doctor, what happened to your hand? I got scratched by a cat. Did it happen while you were giving them food? Great work today. Okay. We'll be going now. -See you tomorrow. -Bye. -Don't forget to lock up. -I won't. Take care. Where are you, Kitty? Kitty, where are you? How dare you rip us off? We can pay you back in two days. Are you having trouble because of ghosts? -We'll take care of it for you. -Did someone die here? Perhaps an evil man in his 50s? A pervert. He suddenly got rid of the clinic and came here. He accepted the teaching position after declining it for so long. You promised to tutor me. When are you going to teach me? You'll never ascend. I didn't see anything. I swear. -What are you doing? -Just tasting. It's a rare sight to see a drunk ghost. Hong Myung-hee? Who told you to touch things in here? You're a ghost. Stop acting like a human. Subtitle translation by: Yoona Moon OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
