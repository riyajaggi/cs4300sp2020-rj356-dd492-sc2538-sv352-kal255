 Don't get me wrong. I did not hit a girl but a ghost. I beat up ghosts whenever I needed money. Please scare away the ghost. Of course, I only beat up the weak ones. ONE MILLION WON ONE MILLION WON A billion. Exactly a billion won. That is my goal in life. ACCOUNT BALANCE: 127 MILLION WON At this rate, it's gonna take... twelve years and nine months. I still have a long way to go. Catching the weak ones isn't cutting it. Should I start with stronger ones and hike up the price? Let's assume the increase in the money supply caused inflation. The J Curve Effect... That's it for today. Don't forget to submit the floating exchange rate system report by next week. -Yes. -Yes. The research will be quite extensive, so I divided you all into groups. Collaborate with your team and work hard on the report. Okay, that's all for today. See you next week. -Thank you. -Thank you. GROUP FIVE PARK BONG-PAL Hey, Bong-pal. We're in the same group. I look forward to working with the top student. PARK BONG-PAL GROUP SIX PARK BONG-PAL You guys are on your own. Leave me out of it. Good luck. What an asshole... He's so arrogant. Oh dear. I didn't mean... Sorry, ma'am. Excuse me, sir! I need to go to the bathroom. My gosh! Gosh... Thank you! My goodness, where am I? Sir... Here you are. Oh, okay. Thank you. -Thank you for your service. -You're welcome. I'll see you on the 49th day. Actually... I don't think that's necessary. Ah, I see. I understand. -Enjoy the rest of your meal. -Thank you. He used to be in such demand. What happened to him? He had strong spiritual power and exorcised ghosts! In his glory days, he held all the funeral services in town. Well, no way to keep the power when he likes drinks and meat like that. -He's old news now, I guess. -Stop it, he might listen. What are you doing in this romantic place all by yourself? You look so sad. College life shouldn't be lonely like this. Exactly! It shouldn't! Look there. How nice would it be to eat, hold hands, and date with a girl like that? Why are you here all by yourself? Do you know why? No, he doesn't know. His face is totally clueless. Excuse me, I know it's our first time seeing each other, but hold on. He's got dark baggy eyes. It's fine. His pulse is weak. It's because there's darkness surrounding you! -You didn't know that? -Gosh, it doesn't look good. My dear friend, do you... believe in ghosts? Dude, it's normal! He might not believe in them. But you know, there is a lot of darkness that we're not aware of. There's so much darkness surrounding you. That's why you eat alone here, okay? I know it sounds scary. But ghosts are around us. There's one right behind you. Stop! -Oh, man! -Don't turn around or it might hurt you. So what are you going to do? Will you continue to live in the darkness? We can shine light upon you. Ouch! Anyways, come to this place if you want to know more. Here. GHOSTNET CLUB REGISTRATION Let's fight through this darkness together! -He left. -He didn't take his food. -Put it back in. -Yes. Man, kids these days are so inconsiderate. They are spoiled. He didn't even answer me. GHOSTNET EVICTION NOTICE Damn it! We've been trying for a week and no one wanted to join our club. At this rate, we're really going to get kicked out. If I get kicked out, I won't be able to pay for my room and board. Let's sell those stuff. Shall we, Cheon-sang? We can pay for room and board for the time being. What are you talking about? Those are our precious assets. Cheon-sang! We haven't shot anything since we bought these. The dog that pooped by the beach? That dog? -You really think you can film ghosts? -I do. Have you been deceived your whole life? We just need one shot! Seriously, just one shot! We'll get more members and money by selling the video. I know. I know that. So when is that going to happen? Let's go! Let's go and do it today! We'll make it a live broadcast. Go where? There. GHOSTS AT SEOYI GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL It's really menacing. We will be okay, right? Cheon-sang? Cheon-sang? What are you doing? I'm preparing to go live. That way, I'll look good on... Look, six people died here. Will we be alright? Six died? Yes! Sure! It'll be fine! Dude, you know what? I served in the marines! Don't be scared. What are you eating? A tranquilizer. Let's go. GHOSTNET What is it? Ghostnet? -Hey, is it on? Is it? -Yeah, we're on live. Okay, okay. Welcome to Ghostnet! -This is an exclusive live broadcast. -Where are we? A place that will stop your heart. We are at... Seoyi Girls' High School. -Cut it out! -Sorry. As you know, seven people fainted after seeing a ghost here not long ago. The school is closed temporarily... What is it? Sadako, we are not in a different school. No, not at all. We'll show you. Okay, here we go. I'm zooming in. Seoyi Girls' High School. There you go. -OMG! YOU REALLY WENT THERE. -WATCH YOUR BACK. Okay. What is it? -WE'LL SEE A GHOST? -WOW. Of course. We're going to show you a ghost for real. Okay, let's find the site where the ghost appeared. Follow follow me. Let's go. We're walking down the hallway right now. It scares the hell out of me. Wait! Wait, wait. It's here. -Please don't play around like that. -Sorry. -I'm sorry, let's continue. -I'll calm down. Please get up. This is the laboratory where the ghost showed up several times. It's so spooky. Ghosts come on the scene like this in horror movies. Hold on. -I'm scared. -Hold on. -You all right? -Yes. -Let's do an interview. -Okay. -I'm in the laboratory room-- -Just a moment. What the heck! Don't do that! -My gosh! -What? Hold on. Wait, hold a sec. Why? What is it? What? What is it? Bong-pal! My goodness. Oh, it's nothing. Let's go. Let's go upstairs. Bong-pal! Oh my... You'd better... open the door quickly, punk. I almost crapped in my pants. And fix the doorbell. It's been not working for three years. You're the only one who visits me. You're such a loner. I'm leaving tomorrow. Your business trip gets shorter and shorter. -I guess people saw your true colors. -How dare you! I'm just taking a break. There's still a lot of people who look for me. Here you go. Enjoy. -What about sausage? -I'm all out. Just eat it. Come on! Wow, it's delicious! Are you keeping that promise? That you keep your distance from ghosts and pretend not to see nor hear them. You have to keep away from them to live a normal life, got it? I know. Have a drink. Oh, wait. Your father sent this to me again. You should've told him the new address after you moved. What for? He doesn't even come and visit me. Take it! Just leave it there. Seriously. Are you an exorcist? Can you get rid of a ghost? There's an evil legendary ghost in our school. Can you help? Okay. BONG-PAL: WHAT KIND OF GHOST? A high school girl. Is that okay? A piece of cake. How much do you charge? A million won each. Hey! Can you get rid of it for sure? One hundred percent sure. Can you come right now? Location? Seoyi Girls' High School. Seoyi Girls' High? If you do it right away, I'll pay you ten million. Deal? Deal! I'm on my way already. He hasn't spent it at all. Stubborn punk. Where are you going? To study. This late at night? I'm preparing for the civil servant exam. You should aim higher and be a high level official with that smart brain. See you later. Watch out for ghosts. Bong-pal! Get some sausages. Oh, okay. Man, this stew is damn good. DEAL! ON MY WAY ALREADY. Okay, we're at the restroom where the ghost supposedly appeared. Wait a minute. Can you hear my heart beating? The atmosphere here feels quite threatening. Everyone, take a deep breath. Let's get in now. Okay, we're going in. We're inside. It's time to check the scene of the incident. -Cheon-sang! -Yeah? Look. SADAKO: PERVERTS! WHY ARE YOU THERE? YOU GUYS ARE CRAZY! I'LL REPORT IT. We're not perverts. Please do not call the cops on us, Sadako. We only came here to film ghosts. Hold tight. Please stay silent. -Goddamn! -Gosh! What is this? It's just a bottle of detergent. I almost had a heart attack. There's nothing inside. Calm down. Don't be afraid. -Gosh! -Gosh! RECORDING TEMPORARILY CLOSED I'm here. Where are you? What's going on? Is she inside? Miss Help Me! Miss Help Me! Miss Help Me! She must be the 10 million won ghost. Looks like a tough one. -Who are you? -Who do you think I am? I'm the exorcist who'll get rid of you. I don't go easy on female ghosts. Be prepared. I'm... Let go of me! Hey! -I said let go of me! It's not me! -Yeah, right. That hurts... Hey, don't act like you're weak. You're a freaking ghost. It really hurts! I know I'm a ghost, but I'm still a girl! How can you hit a girl? I warned you ahead of time. Get up, 10 million won. My heart! -Don't play around. -My heart really hurts. I died from a bad heart. Hey. Hey! Who the heck are you beating up ghosts, huh? Anyway, you're so dead. Do you want to die? You have a death wish? Come down! Come on! I'm going to kill you! Come down! Damn! Hey! Hey! What kind of man are you? Fighting with a girl like this? Seriously! Being a man doesn't make me immortal. You bastard! How dare you block it! Myeongseong University? A student from an elite college, huh? Unbelievable. My nose is bleeding. Don't ever come back! I'm going to kill you next time! He can't even fight and calls himself an exorcist. Damn! What? You cutie! Okay, okay! Kyung-ja. You're here! What's up with your face? I got into a fight with a weirdo. You didn't kill him, did you? You won't be saved if you do that! I don't kill people! I just beat him to death, that's all. It's all good, then. How long are you going to keep following this guy? -It's been two years, isn't it? -I know. I wish he was dead already. Can't wait to introduce myself to him. It was all lies. Counting all his hair won't kill him. How was the school this time? Did you find something? Not yet. I need to go back tomorrow. Too bad. I hope you find it soon. There's not much time left until SAT. It's been five years since you died, huh? Yeah, time flies. Kyung-ja, I don't understand why I'm not in the otherworld already? I mean, you need to be in heaven or hell after death. You either have unfinished business or... Or? Or killed by someone and felt resentful at it. That can make you linger in this world. You still don't remember how you died? No. I don't even know my parents. All I know is this. My name is Kim Hyun-ji. Not sure if it's my real name though. It's not easy to find the school I attended. Who knew there are so many high schools in Korea? Why don't you take the SAT, huh? Remember the first day we met? You came to take the SAT that day without knowing that you were dead. Maybe your unfinished business is taking the SAT. Listen. Take the exam. Who knows? You might get your memory back. Should I? By the way, why are you wandering around? What regret do you have? Well... What would it be? You know what? I need to go to church. What for? I will go pray for him to die soon. See you next time. Should I take the SAT? I'm hungry, Bong-pal. When are we going to eat? Almost ready. Come over. Alright. -Did you have a good night? -Yes. -Where's my sausage? -We have none. Just eat what we have. You didn't buy it last night? You're losing your sense as a monk because you keep eating sausage. -You need to go veggie! -Gosh. I told you to get it. Go ahead. You looked okay last night. What happened to your face? -Where did you get beaten up like that? -Let's just eat. This is why you need to eat meat and sausage. Then you will be too strong to get beaten up. Leave it. I'm not finished. Sir. Among ghosts, do the female ones... usually have strong power too? Maiden ghosts? Maiden ghosts with a lot of regrets are strong. A saying goes that woman's vengeance knows no bounds. Someone like you can be their target. They will suck your energy out. -They should have a weakness. -Sure thing. All ghosts including maiden ones... Why the sudden interest in ghosts? You know... If a ghost attacks me, I should be able to protect myself. You got that black eye from a ghost, didn't you? I told you to run away if you see it. What should I do if they start to chase me? None of this would've happened if you'd handled it properly. I'm telling you that ghost was too strong. -It's not that you were weak? -Come on. Gosh, this is all my fault. Please tell me how to fight back. You want me to get beaten up like this again? It's here. Why on earth are we here? I just wanted know their weakness. Okay. Let me see this. You keep looking at them. Then you can see their weakness. Gosh, I used to be able to see it right away. Sir. Sir? -Stuff like this would help? -Of course it helps. There is this divine energy around. This one... Considering how pure the energy is, this must be a little kid. It's a little kid. Rice works the best when it comes to a kid ghost. Look at him! What's this? Bong-pal! Bong-pal, you punk! Bong-pal! Bong-pal! Let's delete! Delete! Delete! They can't do this to me. Sadako is driving me crazy. It's an act of terror! Cheon-sang, what should we do now? What do you mean? Of course we'll show them what we're made of. Man... -Are you going to go in for sure? -Of course, I am. I should go. I should. -Hold on a second. -Why? We should take this again. -Let's go. -Okay. Sounds scary. Now, today... we will stay here until a ghost appears. We don't know when that's going to happen. Go get snacks to help you wait and go to the bathroom in advance. -Please follow and subscribe our video! -Sure. Take this. Now... we will keep the camera rolling. -Ghost... -Net. It's a perfect weather to fight against a ghost. KIM HYUN-JI Kim Hyun-ji... Damn... I'm not here. Guess it's not my school. Bring it on! Ghost! He's back. I'm in a bad mood already. It's a perfect timing. Hey. I told you not to come back. Didn't I say that, huh? ESSAY ACADEMY Hey, I didn't mean it. Don't get me wrong. You do understand what happened. We were rolling around and... Don't make such a fuss. It's not like you've never kissed before. -What? -What? You haven't kissed anyone yet? Was it your first kiss? You're right. It was my first kiss, you bastard! -Hey, what was that sound? -What? Something happened? -Didn't you hear anything? -Nothing. Did I hear it wrong? -Dude. -Gosh. What are you doing? This is the list of people who have died since this school was built. No wonder you're the top student of the Computer Information Department. Wow, many students have died, huh? Is this site cursed or something? By the way, why is it so quiet? Is this camera still working? I wasn't terrified. I wasn't. It was lightning. Gosh, just a lightning. Good that we took two pills of tranquilizers. Yeah. Anyway, I will get some sleep. -Okay? -Um-hum. What the... What is it? Who the heck was that pervert? Holy crap! It's the English teacher. The one who died on the job 18 years ago. He was just a pervert, not a teacher. It's absurd to say he died on the job. -Cheon-sang. -Yeah? Where's the guy who came out with us? Hey, you pervert! -Dude. -What now? Shouldn't we record the ghost before we leave? -Let me just leave. -But still... -Shall we leave? -Do it yourself. It's a dead end. Sir, I might have been wrong about you. Why don't you continue what you were doing and let me go? Well, she's right over there. Oh no! -Back of the head. -What? Hit the back of his head! You fought pretty good. I know I'm good. -You did pretty good, too. -By the way... -What's your name? -Hyun-ji. Kim Hyun-ji. -And yours? -Me? Park Bong-pal. What kind of name is that! What a relief that it's not Pal-bong. Oh gosh. Sorry... It made me cry. Gosh, by the way... I caught a ghost, but whom should I get the money from? Hey, do you happen to know Help Me? What? Well... no, I don't know who it is. What was that? Are you Help Me by any chance? No, I am not. It's you, isn't it? Then... my money... You... Pay me 10 million won. -I said I'm not the one. -It's gotta be you! -Give me my money. -Hey. -What kind of ghost has money? -Then you shouldn't have called me. Because I was scared of that ghost. That was it. You were scared of a ghost when you're one of them, huh? Forget it. Just give me 10 million won! I don't have it! Besides, since we're already talking about it, did you catch him alone? We did it together. Why should I even pay for it? You're so weak! Unbelievable. Hey, just forget it. I don't want to talk with you anymore. Don't show up ever again, or... -I'll make sure to end you. -How scary! I'm fine with that. That's what I want. Who's there? What are you doing here? Did you fight again? Seriously? You can't go a day without fighting, huh? Where have you been? Prayer service, because my prayers don't seem to be heard. Who did you fight with today? A weirdo. You must be cursed. Such guys keep showing up in your life. Hyun-ji, what happened... to your lips? Well, I just bumped into something. I bumped into something slightly. And suddenly the memories came across my mind. Really? What kind of memories were they? Thing is... I just can't remember them now. What should I do? You should bump into the same thing again. -I should do that, right? -Of course. It's your first time seeing memories after five years. What did you bump into? Well, it was... something mushy and soft. It was warm too. Was it blood sausage? What's your job? -I'm a college student. -College student? Why were you at the girl's high school, not a college? Gosh, there aren't any books in your backpack. Are you training in martial arts? -What is this? -I borrowed it. Detective. You taped a girls' restroom. Why is that? That's not mine. Of course it's not. This was in your pocket. I bet it's not yours, either. What kind of student has this much money? It's worth my yearly rent. -Wait, you said it's not yours. -That one is mine. How did you make such money? Detective, I understand everything points to me being a weirdo. Still, I don't think you would assume that such money came from that, right? I'm not a pervert. -Obviously, I don't look... -Obviously... you look like a pervert. Hey, Detective. There is no suspicious video on his cell phone. He doesn't even have a photo. Did you get in touch with his guardian? His mother passed away a long time ago and his father is still around. He has no number. -He doesn't have his father's number? -No, look at his contact list. He has only one contact. FAKE MONK What an interesting guy. ESSAY ACADEMY Park Bong-pal... Bong-pal! Bong-pal! Hello, I'm here for Park Bong-pal. -Park Bong Pal. He's tall and-- -Ah... Why did you come? What do you mean? The police called me. You don't have your father's number? Why did they call me instead? Maybe it got deleted. What is this? I made it. Are you exorcising? -Hey! -Gee, you startled me. I told you not to do such a thing! Don't yell like that. You have a high blood pressure. -I needed money. -What for? Huh? Why would you need money? You said it yourself last time. My eyes could be fixed with a billion won. That's it. -I was being careful. -Being careful is not enough. You might become one of them while dealing with ghosts. It's not like I'm a proper human being anyway. -Bong-pal. -I need to go. When you visit me next time, I'll make you a stew with top-quality sausage. Bong-pal. Really? Are you sure? I have no idea how and when it got down there. Did it fall in? -What should we do? -Looks like it hasn't been eating. We should get it out now. Don't do that! Mr. Kim got bitten earlier. It seems vicious. Why don't you put on these gloves first? No, it'll scare the dog even more. It's okay. Come on. Good dog. Hi there. There you go. There you are. Ouch! Oh god. I'm sorry. Good dog. There you go. -Wow. -There you go. It's okay. You must have been scared. You were scared, weren't you? Why did you go in there? -Professor, you're bleeding. -Excuse me? -He's bleeding! -Blood! Could you hold it for me? Excuse me. Ah, thank you. Professor Joo Hye-sung, Department of Veterinary Medicine. -Wow. -It looks very calm. Doesn't he look too young to be a professor? Wow, I love this place! Even a professor is so cool. I will examine it. I'm sure everything is okay. -Good. -I will take care of it. I like this school even more. Well, I have no time for this. You look smart. Were you scared a lot? We're going to be late for class. Let's go in. STUDENT SERVICE CENTER Where should I go? Yes! Park Bong-pal... Park Bong-pal... There he is! His address is... 946-1 SOPA-RO, RESIDENT APT 402 JUNG-GU, SEOUL Hey! What took you so long? I've been waiting for you. What's with you? -How did you know I live here? -Did you forget? I'm a ghost. Why are you here anyway? You think I came because I missed you? I told you not to show up ever again. I'm not in the mood to fight. -Me neither! -Then why did you come? I just need to confirm one thing, so just hold on, okay? Just in case... I don't want you to get this wrong. This is the least I want to do. I don't get it. So please do me a favor. No. I don't know what you're up to. Go find someone else. You're not the only ghost who followed me around. She is our savior. If we keep following her, we might be able to film a ghost. -Keep this from other students, okay? -I will. Lim Seo-yeon. She's your type of girl! -Girly type, huh? -Please go away. I'm sensing weird energy here. There is this naughty stray cat. -Another dead body found yesterday. -Last night? Yes, inside the closet of Room One. Are they his parents? Why does he live alone then? How am I supposed to confirm unless he lets me? -What if... -What did you do to me? Mister, you're so dead!
