 Hyun Ji, what's wrong? What happened? Bong Pal. What should I do now? What I saw at the hospital wasn't a coincidence. I can see ghosts. She's human now. She deserves to have a normal life. You don't know how it will affect her if she finds out the truth. -Hyun Ji. -What should I do now? Don't worry. No matter what happens... I'll protect you.

 Bong Pal. Yeah? What was it like when you first saw a ghost? I was scared. I cried and sobbed. I even peed my pants. Back then, like you... I couldn't think of anything. I was frozen in place, trembling. But one day... I wasn't scared anymore. Bong Pal. -Monk Myung Chul. -It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Look, it's leaving. Right?

 All people live with fear in their hearts. Running every time you're scared... You shouldn't do that. You have to be brave and face it. What should I do if I'm a little scared? It's scary doing it alone. Why are you alone? I'm always behind you. Let's go. Let's go home. It's okay, it's okay. You have nothing to be afraid of. Because I will always be next to you. Let's go. Are you home? Yes, I just got home. Hurry up and go to bed. I can't fall asleep. Sleep well. Bong Pal. -You're still awake? -I feel too uneasy to fall asleep. What's that look on your face? Did something happen? -Monk Myung Chul. -What is it? Hyun Ji... can see ghosts. Goodness. That child can see ghosts? Yes. My intuition was right. Is there a solution? You said you could fix my eyes back then. Hyun Ji needs your help more than me. I don't want her to live like me. I'll do whatever I can to get the money. Please help her, Monk. Bong Pal she's been in a coma for five years. It's natural to see scary things when your memories suddenly return. Seeing ghosts could be temporary. Don't worry so much. -That's probably what it is, right? -Of course. I'm sure it will disappear once her memories fully return. Until then, make sure you take good care of her, okay? Yes. Did you sleep well? Yes, what about you? Yes, I slept well. What are you doing today? I have to meet Professor Joo in the morning. Okay, I'll see you in the afternoon then. Okay, I'll call you. I miss you. Hyun Ji! Kim Hyun Ji, wake up! I'm late! Hyun Ji! Not a single one. Ben, looks like we're going back empty-handed. Should we go and eat breakfast? Ben! Ben, no! Don't do that! What is it? Stop! What is it? Puppies are scared of their surroundings when they are first born. You have to take them for walks so that fear will disappear. It's important to ease their anxiety. So they need to adjust like me. Of course. It may not be the case right now but your mental trauma could be huge. That's why it's important that you take it easy and slowly ease back into your daily activities. How about you meet more frequently with Happy from now on? Ah, I'd like that, but I feel like I'm bothering you. Not at all. I'd like it if you got closer to this rascal. If you play with dogs frequently your endorphins will increase and the anxiety will disappear. You feel emotionally stable, so it will help you out a great deal. So come to the hospital often and play with him. Yes, I'll do that. What's wrong? Did something get in your eye? Young lady, where is the item you're supposed to give me? What's wrong? I think the memories from my accident have returned. Don't force yourself to remember. You'll remember naturally in due time. Leave the bad memories behind and try to remember the good ones. There's no need to remember the bad memories. Yes, I'll try to do that. Hello? How did you first meet Bong Pal? We were just... destined to meet. -You were destined to meet? -Yes, I think so. It's hard to explain, but I keep running into him. Destiny, huh? That's nice. Thank you for dropping me off. I'll see you next time. -Let's go. -Let's go. You were destined to meet? Interesting. Why did we come here? So I can buy you clothes. Go and pick what you like. Exercise clothes? Yes. It's strange no matter how much I think about it. What is? That monk. Why did he ask such a favor from us? Do you by chance know Prof. Joo Hye Sung? Professor Joo Hye Sung? Yes, he's a veterinary professor at our school. Then can I ask you to do me a favor? Make sure you're with Bong Pal at all times. Are you giving us permission to exorcise ghosts with... Don't be ridiculous! -Then what is it? -Stick close to Bong Pal! If Professor Joo Hye Sung does anything strange to Bong Pal... Call me immediately. Got it? No kidding. I wonder if something is going on with Professor Joo Hye Sung. So, he basically wants us to be Bong Pal's bodyguards. Bodyguards? Well, it's true. I am pretty reliable. Where are we going? Bong Pal asked us to do a favor So I said to him, "You come here." I told him to come over. Okay, I'm a ghost. -You? -Just think of me as a ghost. When the ghost attacks you from behind like this... How beautiful. You two look very beautiful. -What a nice picture. -You're here. -Gosh, it's so hot today. -I know. I told you two to loosen up but you guys are making out instead. You cute lovebirds. Okay, so you need to learn from an expert. You two are nothing but amateurs. If you try to copy the moves on the mat, you sneaky little punks -you'll get into trouble! -Ah, he's an expert? He's majoring in Physical Education. How should we introduce ourselves to our little lady who lost her memory? Did she completely forget our faces? Go first, Kim Il Rang, and say, "Nice to meet you." Hi, Hyun Ji. I'm Kim Il Rang. I'm Choi Chun Sang. I'm the CEO of Sundae Soup and a top student in Physical Education. and a master of kumdo, judo, and jujitsu. You can say I'm an expert of martial arts. Yes, hello. The self-defense techniques we'll be learning today are not to be used on normal people. Especially not on men. Why? Because it could be fatal to reproduction. Senior... be careful. Don't worry. I'll go easy on her. Practice as if it's a real situation. I'm a pervert right now. -Okay. -Okay. You're really pretty. What's your name? What's your number? -Senior. -Chung Sang. Senior. No, no, no, relax! Stay still! It's okay, it's okay. He's fine. I did it reflexively. Let's take a look. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Why didn't you mention you're a black belt in taekwondo? No wonder you were so good at fighting when you were a ghost. By the way I hope your memories return soon. There's no need to rush. Still, her memories need to return so we can catch the person who did this to her. It's not fair. I'm sure it will return soon. I can understand that you don't remember the car accident. How could you forget Bong Pal? It's the same for Il Rang. Although he looks all right, do you know how sad he was? He was crying and bawling because of you, saying he'd kill himself. It's your favorite side dish! Pickled fish! There you go. -Rice. -Okay. -Here. -But why the sudden self-defense? I thought it would be of some help to Hyun Ji. Working out can't be planned. You have to make it natural as possible for it to feel like you're working out. In Hyun Ji's case, she needs a workout that stimulates her mind and intellect. What is it? Thank you, Miss Kim Hyun Ji, for proving that miracles can happen in our lives. Hyun Ji's heart is beating after five years. This song is for you, Hyun Ji. That is such an old song. It's still beating! And it's beating for you! I still don't know that it's over. I don't understand why I'm acting like this. It still hurts thinking of you. I think of you every time my heart beats. -50 percent! -We got 50 percent! -Go in. -Go home safely. -I'm back. -Hyun Ji, you're home. -He's from the real estate agency. -Hello. Yes, hello. I'll be on my way then. -Please take good care of us. -I will. -Why is he here? -We put the house up for sale. -Already? -What do you mean already? Your father is all by himself. We need to join him as soon as possible. -When are we going to leave? -As soon as the house sells. Wash up so we can eat. Okay. Hello? Is this Monk Myung Chul? Yes, I'm Myung Chul. Who is this? I'm Officer Choi from the Yangju police station. Ah yes, hello! What's the matter? You reported that Park Ji Hoon is missing, right? Did you find him? Yes. I think so. I think it's best if you come and confirm his identity. Confirm his identity? Is this person Park Ji Hoon? Yes. You poor soul. Why are you lying here? What am I supposed to do? What is our Bong Pal supposed to do? Excuse me... Ah, yes... thank you. What do you think of moving the body to Seoul and getting an autopsy there? The doctor says that his neck is broken. I don't think he died from a fall. Are you saying he was murdered? It would be best to get an autopsy for the exact details. Here you go. A dead body was found buried in a mountain in Yangjugoon, Gangwondo. Based on the condition of the body, the police is assuming he was buried at least two months ago. He was identified as a Mr. Park who was reported missing a month ago. To find the exact cause of death, the police will request an autopsy at the National Forensic Service. Here is the next story. Monk Myung Chul. You're home. -Are you going out? -To the convenience store. Go inside. Bong Pal. I found your father. I see. Okay. Bong Pal. Let's go see your father together. Forget it. Go by yourself. Bong Pal! Come with me. To see your father. Monk Myung Chul. Why... is my father here? Why... is my father here? MEDICAL RECORD (JOO HYE SUNG) Senior. -What is it? -We got a call from NFS. They discovered a body who died the exact same way as Noh Hyun Joo did. What? -Let's go. Quickly. -Yes, sir. Senior! NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE The body was discovered in Gangwondo. It's the same as Noh Hyun Joo's case. He died instantly from a broken neck. Before that, he must've been in a fight. His body has bruises all over. The culprit's DNA should be on his body then. We won't know for sure until an autopsy is done. -But it's possible. -When will it be done? It'll start as soon as the family gives consent. AUTOPSY CONSENT FORM This is the consent form for your father's autopsy. The police are saying that your father's death is suspicious. They need consent from the family first. Think carefully before you sign. HYUN JI Hyun Ji, come and eat! I'm coming. BONG PAL, ARE YOU SLEEPING? WHAT'RE YOU DOING? BONG PAL... Hey! What the heck, Bong Pal? Why aren't you picking up your phone? What did you say? Nothing. You're dead if you ignore my texts again. You have 10 minutes. MISSED 11 CALLS 28 NEW MESSAGES Bong Pal! Park Bong Pal! Bong Pal! Where did he go? Hello, Professor Joo. MISSED 11 CALLS 28 NEW MESSAGES I was thinking about doing therapy outside the hospital. What do you think? -Hyun Ji. -Yes? -Is something wrong? -No. Where are you thinking about going? There is a place Happy likes. It'll take some time though. Okay. Hey, Park Bong Pal. How can you do that? -Hyun Ji? -Yes. Who is this? How is Bong Pal doing? Oh no, I will be right there. Thank you. Bong Pal. Hyun Ji. Why didn't you call me? Sorry, I've been too busy. What do you mean you're sorry? What are you going to do, Bong Pal? It's okay. It's time to go. Okay. Let's talk later. -You came. -Hello. -You're the monk who called me, right? -Correct. -Thank you for coming. -No problem. Monk Myung Chul. He's Bong Pal's father, right? Yes. Please help me do well on the SAT. I've met him before. What did you say? You've met him before? When and where? It was at a temple five years ago. -Young lady, can I ask you a favor? -Pardon? Can you take this to my son? It has his address. You shouldn't let anyone see it, okay? -I'm begging you. -Wait... He asked me to do him a favor and gave me something. He asked me to give it to his son. He also asked me not to show it to anyone. Did you... see what was inside? DAEHAN STUDY, SEOKJEONG-DONG, SEOUL PARK BONG PAL Park Bong Pal... Hyun Ji. -Are you okay? -Yes, I'm okay. Do you happen to remember where you put it? No, I don't remember anything else. It's okay. Get some rest. It's okay. Get some rest. Why don't you stay here and rest? Hyun Ji. That is very important to Bong Pal. If you remember, please tell me, okay? -I will. -Get some rest. Thank you for coming. I'm very sorry for your loss. You bastard! What are you doing? How can you possibly show up here? I came because I worried about my student. -Is that a problem? -You think I wouldn't know you? I don't know what you're talking about. -Please let go of me. -18 years ago. I can still sense the traces of that evil spirit within you. You think I wouldn't have recognized it if you tried to hide it from me? The spirit that came out of Bong Pal is still very much alive in your eyes. Can you? You killed Bong Pal's mother. It wasn't enough, so you killed Bong Pal's father. How many more do you have to kill before you stop? Then why did you kick me out of Bong Pal's body? This is all because of you. You! You're that evil spirit I drove out! So what can you do now? I warned you, didn't I? Too much curiosity can kill you. -Get the heck out of that body! -If I leave, this guy will die. We're one body now. Do you want someone else to die? You are mistaken here. I saved his life. I saved him from hell. You're bad luck. Get lost! Your mom killed your dad. Murderer. Let's go. My mom is not a murderer. She is not. My mom is not a murderer. What is he doing? I'm the one who killed that bastard. You might not want to be in my way. Bong Pal could get killed this time. Isn't it better to have a double funeral for both father and son? You bastard! What do you think you're doing? What do you think? Does it hurt? This is how you threaten someone. If you want to save your pathetic life you might want to stay quiet. I will spare you this time for old times' sake. I will snap your neck next time. Hope everything goes well with the funeral. Tell Bong Pal that I came by to pay my respects. Monk Myung Chul. Monk Myung Chul. -What happened? -It's nothing. It's nothing. -Sir. -Yes? The autopsy results for Park Ji Hoon. There were traces of DNA found under his fingernails. A male with blood type B. -What is Joo's blood type? -It's B. -We have his DNA. Go file a warrant. -I will. Now we've got you. Bong Pal, don't go anywhere. Stay home. -Pull yourself together. -Don't worry. -Thank you. -Sure. Take care. Hyun Ji, you did well at the funeral. I didn't do anything. Hyun Ji. How do you know Professor Joo? He's helping me with my psychotherapy. Why do you ask? By any chance... It's nothing. Nothing. Please take care of him. -I will. -Thank you. Bong Pal. I'm okay. Don't worry. You haven't eaten anything since yesterday. -Let's go eat something. -I'm okay. I'm tired, so I'm going to rest. I will see you later. -I'll call you. -Okay. Get some rest then. MY DEAR SON, BONG PAL. I WONDER HOW YOU ARE... I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. So you're saying that the girl was given the weapon... by Bong Pal's father? Correct. That's why she got into an accident. -She doesn't remember where to put it. -Gosh. It is an ill-fated relationship. But we should let her know what's going on at least. That it was Prof. Joo who hit her with his car. He's around the girl. If I tell her... and the evil spirit finds out, she might be put in more danger. How about Bong Pal? He should know who killed his dad at least. I don't know if I should tell him or not. Why is the evil spirit so obsessed with that weapon? If it's that powerful, he should run away. Don't you think? It can threaten his life, so he should get rid of it. And then what? Could he be... after Bong Pal? Please keep this here. -I'm home. -Are you? Can you come help? What are you doing? Why are you packing already? Ah, this place has been sold. A newlywed couple signed the contract yesterday. Why are you standing there? Go pack up in your room. The movers will come tomorrow morning. Mom, can I stay here? What are you talking about? Why stay here? Where would you stay? I can stay at my uncle's. Are you saying that because of Bong Pal? Hyun Ji, it's only been a month since you regained consciousness. You were in a coma for a long time. That's why you were drawn to his kind gestures. But you shouldn't do that. When you see your old friends back in our neighborhood you will change your mind. No. I can't leave Bong Pal. Do you know how hard things are for him? I've to be there for him. I can agree to everything else but this. You should study hard and take the GED. And go to college too. I'm not telling you to break up with him. If you get into college after you go home and study hard, you can see him again then. Don't you think? I'm going out for a little. Hyun Ji! You... Hey. Bong Pal, you're in there, right? Open the door, Bong Pal. I'm leaving tomorrow. We're moving back to my dad's. So... before I leave... I wanted to see you. I will come back soon. Wait for me, Bong Pal. I will call you. You need to answer, okay? Hyun Ji. -Professor Joo. -What brings you here? You don't look good. Is something wrong? It's nothing. Do you want to come in? You don't look so good. Have some tea. BONG PAL, SLEEPING? PARK BONG PAL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DON'T IGNORE MY TEXT. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND CALL ME. Is anyone home? Police. Monk Myung Chul. Park Bong Pal. Please come in. I'm sorry I have to barge in like this. It's okay. Are the autopsy results out yet? Yes. It appears that your dad was murdered. So we have a few questions for you. Do you know how your dad knew Professor Joo? Professor Joo? Is he... related to my dad's death? I can't be too sure, but it's very likely. So tell me anything you can think of. It doesn't matter how trivial it is. Monk Myung Chul, where are you? Monk Myung Chul. Did you know about it, by any chance? What do you mean? The detective came by. He asked me about Professor Joo. Professor Joo... has something to do with my dad's death. Bong Pal. Professor Joo is not human. Accurately speaking... a non-human is inside his body. Evil spirit. The evil spirit that came out of your body a long time ago has been hanging around you and Hyun Ji. Hyun Ji? She has what he wants. What's wrong? I just feel dizzy. I will use the bathroom. MY LOVE BONG BONG Your call is being redirected... Is Hyun Ji home? -Is this your car? -I said just go. Why bother me? -I have to find Hyun Ji. -He'll be after you then. -You will be in danger. -What about Hyun Ji? What are you going to do? I have to finish what I couldn't 18 years ago. -Hyun Ji! Kim Hyun Ji! -If you still can't find her... If it was five years ago, we're at the wrong place. You're no longer needed. I will let you rest now. I will end you today, you evil spirit! Monk Myung Chul! Subtitle translation by
