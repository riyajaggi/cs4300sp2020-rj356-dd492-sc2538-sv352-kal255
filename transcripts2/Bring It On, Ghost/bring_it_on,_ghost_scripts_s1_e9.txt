 Never again. EPISODE 9 -Good night. -You too. Hey, Hyun-ji. Um... -What? -Thing is... It's too hot inside. You can sleep in my room from now on. -Me? -Yes. You know I can't stand the heat. -Good night. -Okay. Don't disappear on me. Never again. His father passed away by an accident when he was young. Thereafter, he has been living with his mother. He lived in a dorm during his middle school years. And he has been living alone since then. It seems like he keeps in touch with his mother. But they rarely visit each other. -That's it? -Yes. Honestly, there's not much to look into. He didn't even have any tickets. His hospital payment record is also clean. The only thing is his medical records. -What about it? -It's nothing special. He was very ill when he was young. He has quite a bit of medical records. -What do people say about him? -They're all busy complimenting him. They said he's nice and diligent. It's understandable. He participates in 5 volunteer groups. And he operates on stray dogs for free. No one ever saw him upset or irritated. He's the whole package. High intelligence, perfect look, and great personality. You're right. He is perfect. He's way too perfect to be a human. Not even a bit. What about changing the approach on the investigation? -Did you find Noh hyun-joo's cell phone? -No. I contacted the phone company. They said her phone was turned off in front of her house. Check if we missed anyone on her calls list. Yes, sir. Track down Prof. Joo's cellphone location on the first and the second. And compare the path of his vehicle with the location where the body found. Sure. I will, sir. REST IN PEACE Did you hear how Hyun-joo died? -She died from a broken neck. -Really? -Oh my god. -Did they find a suspect? No, not yet. It's Eun-soo. Who is he? He told Hyun-joo that he liked her last semester. Professor, how are you? -Are you here for her? -Yes. -Professor, I... -You should go comfort her family. -You're awake. -Yes. You must be hungry. It should be ready soon. -Why are you not eating? -Huh? I am now. -Why? Is it not good? -It's delicious. Then why are you picking at the food? No, I'm not. I always eat like this. It's green. Let's run! -What's the title of the book again? -Economic Theory. Economic Theory... It should be somewhere here. -Oh, it's right here. -Huh? Excuse me. I have something to do. See you later. Hey, where are you going-- Ouch! -Enjoy. -Thanks. Have a safe trip back. Hey, In-rang. Let's eat! Let me see. One, two, three... Wow! Wait, why do we have extra? I ordered one for Bong-pal. But then, there are 3 people including him. But why four dishes? Dude! You... Now you make money and spend too much. You've changed. Okay then, let's see. This one. Grilled beef rib lunch box. I like this a lot. I will try this. -It's for Hyun-ji. -What? -It's for Hyun-ji. -Hyun... You mean, the angel? Gosh, you are crazy about her. You might even forsake your country. You even bought shoes for a ghost. Love is being crazy. Being crazy? You have gone crazy! Why don't you go out with her? Stop it! That's embarrassing, dude! Gosh. You are insane, huh? Hey, you are a human and she is a ghost. Don't you know what that means? She is already dead, okay? Man! Why don't you marry her and have kids? Are you that happy? Ghosts can't live with people. Can't you understand that? Dude! It's too early to mention a wedding. You should go to Samil Mental Hospital. You should be admitted. My gosh. Unbelievable. You eat now! We are going to eat together once Hyun-ji and Bong-pal get here. How dare you! Our angel's not even here yet. How come you try to eat first? Wait! Stay still. My god! My heart was about to blow up. It would be great if Kyung-ja was here. We could talk about Bong-pal. Where is she anyway? I haven't seen her for a while. She's not here either. Did she go home? Oh, Pal, Pal, Pal! Welcome. -Hello, In-rang. -Hi, Hyun-ji. Well, Hyun-ji is not here with me. She isn't? Where is she? I guess she went home. Hey, Bong-pal. Have a seat. Bong-pal, is there anything worrying you? -The thing is... there's a woman-- -A woman? Well, let's say you want to do something for her. But what if you're not sure what to do? -This is not about me. -Sure thing, this is not about you. -It is about your friend, right? -Yeah, that's right. Hmm, Woman... Woman. I guess it's time to pull out my trump card on love affairs. It's not easy to figure out what a woman wants or what you should do for her. Love affairs? Do you even know what love is? A baby like you should stay out of this. Got it, kiddo? Um... Before you look for what she wants, you should find out what type of person she's attracted to. Assistant? Look here. You don't have to be handsome. Ghostnet! Put your hand like this. Move your fingers. It's okay if you have an ugly face like a squid. It's not important. I mean that is not the men's charming point. Then what are men's charming points? In English, we call it "charming." Ah... Charms. Shall we start now? Step one! Ta-da! Side profile. The neck muscles that symbolize masculine beauty and the sharp nose that is full of intellectual beauty. When women see those, they will... totally fall for you. Step two! Ta-da! Eye contact. Eye contact. Sometimes, unpolished beauty can be overwhelming and do the trick. When you look at her with mellow eyes that can even embrace the ocean, she might be defrosted like a glacier melting by the global warming. Step three! Ta-da! I'm fine. It's okay. Don't cry, you fool. Anyways, you should be able to make her laugh when she is in despair. What do you say when an apple smiles? A smiley apple! A sense of humor. A sense of humor is one of the most strongest charms of men. So, is this helpful to you? It's okay. I have eight more. There are eleven steps. Step four! Ta-da! I think I'm good. That's enough. Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji? BONG-PAL AND HYUN-JI Oh dear... -Hyun-ji! -Hey, Bong-pal. Where were you? I told you to stay by my side. Don't disappear. I've been looking for you. Sorry. -What were you doing? -Nothing, really. Charms! What are men's charming points? Step one! Side profile. -Hyun-ji. -Yeah? -Bong-pal. -Huh? -Bong-pal? -Yeah? Why? Are you not feeling well? What's wrong? No, I just... I have a stiff neck. Is this not it? Step two! Eye contact. Eye contact, okay. -Hyun-ji? -Yes? What? Are we playing a staring contest? No. My vision is blurry. -It seems not working either. - Step three! A sense of humor is one of the most strongest charms of men. Hyun-ji, do you want some funny stories? -What is it? -Who is the poorest king in the world? Hmm... The king who earns the least. Isn't this funny? -What is the hottest phone in the world? -Well. Video call. What do you say when an apple smiles? Smiley apple! Are you sure you are okay? -Are you okay? -Yeah... -It's not working. -What is not working? Oh... It's nothing. Let's have lunch. Meat! Wow! It's all done. Can I eat it now? -Sure, you can start. -Which one should I pick? Meat works like a magic. That star is the brightest. That one? That's Altair. -Like in the Altair and the Vega? -Correct. And that one right there is Vega. The one spread out is the Milky Way. Oh, I see. I didn't know that. Those two stars are really far apart. It must be sad. They are far apart and only get to see each other once a year. I guess they are happy to see each other. Even though it's only one day a year. By the way, how do you know so much about constellations? My father taught me when I was young. -Do you want to listen more? -Yeah. The one shining on top is Aquila. So there's Aquila... Bong-pal, are you asleep? Go to bed if you want to go out tomorrow. Really? Are we going on a date tomorrow? Well... yeah. It's a date. Okay. I will get up early tomorrow. Good night. Meet me in your dreams. -What do you want to do today? -All the little things other couples do. Eat out, have a cup of tea, watch a movie, and walk together. -All right. Let's do what others do. -Okay. Ow! Hey! -How dare you! -No! Stop! No! Hey! Sorry! I'm so sorry! Stop it! Excuse me. What's taking her so long? What am I supposed to wear on a first date? No! Bong-pal. Why did you tell me to leave first? Nothing. Let's go. It's pretty! Not this one. It looks so similar to the one you already have. Not bad. Knock, knock. -Mister, what do you have here? -We have makgeolli. Oh, really? Can I have a bottle? No drinks for you. What about this? So pretty! Looks great! I like it. Do you want it? Two tickets for the 10 o'clock movie. We have couple seats and regular seats. Which would you like? -Couple seat please. -Just a moment please. Bong-pal, I want that. -Can you eat this all by yourself? -Sure, this is nothing to me. Here. It feels like we're a real couple, right? What would you like to eat? Whatever you want. Excuse me. Are you ready to order? Yes, I will have the meal number two. Meal number two is for party of two or more. Yes, I'm okay with that. Can I have another glass of water here? Sure. Here. You spent too much today. A movie and a full-course meal. -I can handle it. -But still... Okay then. I will exorcise more and make you a lot of money. They're all dead meat now. Sounds good. Oh, wait. It's raining. -Let's run! -Huh? Wait a second. Shall we go? Bong-pal, aren't you getting all wet? It's okay. Let's go. Yeah. COLLEGE GIRL MURDER CASE RECORD OF THE CRIME SCENE Sir, are you gonna go through the testifiers again? I should do everything I can. -Detective, it's from the analysis team. -Thank you. What is it? Oh, these are the photos taken from the CCTV at the tollgate. Sir, you might want to see this. -The license plate matches, right? -Yes, it's Prof. Joo's plate number. Before we question the other testifiers, bring Prof. Joo to the station. -Arrest him if he resists. -Understood, I'm going now. -A fountain pen? -I gave it to Professor Joo... Where were you on the day Noh Hyun-joo was murdered? I was at my clinic. I'll see you later. Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji. Is the power out? Are you okay? Bong-pal, I'm scared. -Feeling better? -Yeah, I'm okay now. Bong-pal. I wanted to ask you something. What is it? When did you start seeing ghosts? Maybe when I was five... Probably around then. You were so little. -How did it start? -I'm not sure. According to Monk Myung-cheol, it's because I still have evil spirit remained inside of me. Evil spirit? What is that? I don't really know. I have no memories left before five. It must have been scary. It was. I'm okay now. Thank you, Bong-pal. -For what? -For everything. Everything is okay when I'm with you. When I woke up as a ghost without any memory I was so scared and lonely. But I'm not anymore. Even if I don't get my memory back, I like how things are now. I'm so glad that you can see me. I'm so glad that I can see you. Sir. Hi. PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT JOO HYE-SUNG It's the photo of your car taken at dawn on the second. Is it your license plate number? Yes, it's my car. I see. You passed the tollgate at 11:28 p.m. on the first. You arrived at Insung at 1:38 a.m. on the second. Then you took Road 34, and arrived at the entrance to Mount Ujeong. You came back to Seoul early morning on the same day. -Do you remember? -Yes. I don't know if you're aware. Noh Hyun-joo's body... was found near Mount Ujeong. She was murdered on the night of the first. It appears her body was abandoned at dawn on the second. Isn't it interesting that you happened to be in the same area? Why did you go to the mountain in the middle of the night? It feels like I'm a suspect. Please answer my question. I went to see my mother. My mother lives near there. -Your mother? -You can check if needed. -You're getting away with it, huh? -It's the truth. Hello, this is Detective Kim. Sir, I need you for a second. Excuse me. What do you mean? Thing is... one of the witnesses of the case found dead. Who is it? His name is Lee Min-soo, a student at Myeongseong University. According to the phone record, he talked to Hyun-joo for a minute on the 30th. I included him on the testifiers list. It appears he jumped from his place and killed himself. -He committed suicide? -Correct. And he claimed that he killed Noh Hyun-joo. The approximate time of his death is... right after he came back from Hyun-joo's funeral. Who are you? I'm sorry. I killed Hyun-joo. I really didn't mean it. He texted his mom before he killed himself. He said he killed Hyun-joo. Her cell phone was found in his room, too. It seems that he was following her around since last semester. Chief wants us to wrap up this case, and focus on the murder case in Uyeon-dong. What do you think? Get the documents and put them on my desk. Yes, sir. You're still here. Hello there! -Do you know him? -Yes. When you gave me a hard time, he was there for me. -Come on, when did I give you a hard time? -Bong-pal! It's that handsome professor. Hello, Professor. What are you doing here? Well, I was looking at the dog. Were you? Why don't you go in? -Let's have some tea, too. -Oh! I want to go in. Come on. Let's get in. You look like you're watching your girlfriend. -Excuse me? -Why are you so surprised? I saw love in your eyes. -I guess you like dogs, huh? -Well... That dog is very pretty. Summer break is around the corner. Have you completed your volunteer hours yet? No, I haven't. Then can you help me with the volunteer work I'm doing? We are short of hands. You can fill up your volunteer hours. What do you think? Sounds good. I was looking for something anyways. -Good then. -Where are you going? Hey, where are you going? Hey, puppy. Where are you? Where did he go? There you are! Come here. You're so pretty. Professor. -I'm leaving now. -Ah, wait a second. You are not allowed here. It's not nice of you. -Go upstairs first. -Yes, professor. KIM HYUN-JI -Thank you, professor. -Sure, take care. Wait, that punk is... Bong-pal! Sir. Who was the man at the veterinary clinic earlier? -You mean the professor? -Professor? Yes, he's a professor at my school. I see, then he also lives in the same apartment with you? -No, it seems that he lives in his clinic. -In his clinic... What is it? Hmm... It's nothing. Let's go. Are you going home? -Yes. -Let's go. It's hot. Bong-pal. Are you studying for the SAT? And why do you have photos in the back? I needed to work on some foundation courses. By the way, what brings you here? You didn't call me. Have I ever called you in advance? What is it? Is there something in the balcony? Oh, no. Nothing at all. Have you noticed anything weird around you? No, not much. -Why? -Nothing. Never mind. Let me see. Can I come out? He can sometimes feel the presence of ghosts. Ugh... Does he save his dad's phone number? He doesn't! One two two three, it's... BONG-PAL, YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATION... May 13th? May 13th... It's when he stayed at the B&B.; Middle school graduation... -Bong-pal! -Yes, sir? When was your middle school graduation? Well... Probably in February. I guess so. Why are you asking? Nothing. Get back to your things. Hello. I will be right there. Sir, I need to leave. I'll be back soon. Sure. Hmm... graduation... What happened at the graduation? Why he sent such a text? Oh wait, he taped the graduation. Let's go find it. He definitely taped it. September, June, May... wait. I remember the service I had on the same day. It must be February... February 24th. Yeah, it's February 24th. Well, they said the ghost possesses this man's body. So stay behind Bong-pal today, Hyun-ji. -It's dangerous. -I will. You must be happy. He's looking out for you. -Are you jealous now? -What is she saying? -Are you okay? -What are you thinking? Sit properly! Hyun-ji, are you okay? DUWON MIDDLE SCHOOL THE 24TH GRADUATION No! Oh no... No! No! My brother was very ill a while ago. And he got well. But then one day, he suddenly had a seizure. Hyeon-min! What's wrong? Ow! Hyeon-min! Hyeon-min, open the door! Are you okay? Open the door! Hyeon-min! -Hyeon-min! -Hold on, I have a key. -No... -Since then, he's been lying in bed all day and screaming whenever he's awake. My mom thinks his body is possessed by a ghost. Let me go in first. Why it's not working? No... Please! -Hey... Hyeon-min! -No! Bong-pal, over there. She is the ghost that we saw earlier. So you're saying that girl was strangling my son? She should've gone to the other side without making any trouble. Why my son? Let's go inside, okay? Who is that lady, by the way? She dated with my brother while ago. Is there anything that you want from us? Once he falls back asleep, he doesn't wake up for two days. -He might be stable until then. -Then we will come back in two days. -Give us a call if anything happens. -I will. My goodness! Is there really something in this? Bong-pal, look here! Smile, kid! Why is he there? Please take care. -Hey, you saw that, didn't you? -Saw what? Didn't he make you think about something? -No. -No? Your brain completely stopped working. If you follow around a ghost, the same thing will happen to you, okay? Ghosts will drain your energy completely. How could you possibly survive? Do you want to be like him? How are you gonna live like that? A ghost and a human are not meant to be together. I told-- -Ow! -Keep your voice down. She's listening. You think she heard? Of course she did. Isn't it too obvious? Sorry. Here. Let's go. Bong-pal. Are we going to be okay? People... wouldn't accept our relationship. It doesn't make any sense to them. I like you. I don't care what others think. I like you just the way you are, Hyun-ji. -You're so ugly. -Stop it. We will also part company like them some day. Bong-pal, who are you talking to? This ghost was seen here and there on campus. But the way it looks is very peculiar. Wait, it's the tape from my middle school graduation. Why was he watching this out of the blue? You have the address of the professor's mother, right? Hyeon-min! He killed the one he loved and himself out of guilty feelings. How can you be in love with a ghost? Bong-pal, I want you to be happy. Hyun-ji! Kim Hyun-ji! Subtitle translation by: Hye Young Beom
