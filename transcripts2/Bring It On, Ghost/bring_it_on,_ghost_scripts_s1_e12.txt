 Hyun-ji. Hyun-ji. Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! I told him to lie still on the bed! Where did he go? Gosh, he sure doesn't listen. He shouldn't be moving around. -Bong-pal! -Hey, Bong-pal! -Bong-pal! -Bong-pal! -Let's carry him. -Why in the heck... Hold on... Hyun-ji, wake up! DR KIM JEONG-WOO Mom. Dad.

 -Hyun-ji! -Hyun-ji! Why am I here? Why are you crying? You don't remember the accident? An accident? Me? You've been in a coma for five years. You don't remember? Doctor, why doesn't she remember anything? Don't worry so much. It's a minor aftereffect of being in a coma for such a long time. Your memories will return in time. Let's make sure your condition is stable first and do a physical exam. Let's just be thankful that she's awake now. Congratulations, Hyun-ji. I'll see you again. Yes. -Thank you, Doctor. -Thank you. -Hyun-ji. -Hyun-ji. Do you remember me? Continue to follow up on Kim Hyun-ji. And consult with neurosurgeons as she seems to have memory issues. Yes, Professor. KIM HYUN-JI, FEMALE, 24 You really don't remember anything? Yes, I don't remember anything. My head just hurts a little. Don't try too hard to remember. Those memories aren't important. Not when you came back alive. I'm so happy. It's okay. Why are you crying if you're happy? Don't cry. Not you too, Dad. You've been through a lot. Thank you for staying alive. -Don't, Mom. -Thank you, Hyun-ji. Doctor, are his BP and OP okay? Isn't he going into arration? Don't you need to give him an Epi or an intubation? You've watched too many medical dramas. That's not necessary and his x-rays are fine. But it seems like he's overworked himself lately. He's exhausted and his nutritive condition is a mess. I've prescribed him vitamins. He can be discharged after he rests the whole day. Yes, Doctor. Thank you. I guess he eventually collapsed after Hyun-ji left. Bong-pal was struggling? Why? Well, I guess Bong Pal and Hyun-ji were kind of an item. An item... Hyun-ji has feelings for Bong-pal? I think Bong-pal has feelings for Hyun Ji too. That's why he's in this state after she left. You know, getting hurt from a painful breakup is every man's fear. So that's what happened. Hyun-ji and Bong Pal were... I see. Are you okay? -I'm okay. -You're okay. And don't try to hurt Bong-pal. FLOWER VIRGIN SHAMANESS Is it true that there's one more weapon? I heard the head monk prepared one. Hong Myeong-hee met the head monk before she passed away. I heard she asked him to prepare another weapon. One more? Do you know where that weapon is? He passed away and that's all I heard. There's one more weapon. She had it made for the sake of her son. I'm sure having that made was not easy. Do you maybe think the personal item Bong-pal's father went looking for.... It was the weapon. Then the reason why that evil spirit is hanging around Bong-pal... It's because of that weapon. That's lethal to him. That's why the bastard is chasing him. I have to go. -You're leaving already? -Yes. Watch out for yourself. If that punk is serious, he won't go easy on you. Thanks. I'll call you. KIM HYUN-JI What should I do with you? Avalokite≈õvara... Bong-pal. Where did he go? Bong-pal. Is this rascal in trouble? -Hello? Who is it? -Hello... Isn't this Bong-pal's cell phone? Yes, it is. In the hospital? Which hospital is it? Yes, I understand. That punk! -Who is it? -I don't know. Hello? I told you already. What the heck? Bong-pal. What happened? He's not seriously injured. He just passed out from exhaustion. The doctors says he'll be fine after a day of rest. Goodness, he must've been seriously heartbroken. But who are you? Yes... we're... We're Bong-pal's seniors as well as business partners. Business partners? -With Bong-pal? -Yes. Ah... this... -Ah... -It's nothing great really. We're running a 24-hour exorcism business. -I'm CEO Choi Cheon-sang. -I'm Manager Kim In-rang. What's the matter? Who are you? He's a monk. You punks... You're the punks I met at Gampo Inn. So, you punks are using Bong-pal to catch ghosts, is that it? We're not using him. We both agreed upon... -You punk! -Don't do this. Don't you know how dangerous exorcism is? It does look a bit dangerous, but this is the 21st century... Why you little punk! -I was wrong! -Are you going to continue or not? If you ever use Bong-pal again, I'm going to... You too! Goodness, you rascal. You get sick because of that one ghost. You guys stay right next to Bong-pal. Don't go anywhere. I'm going to meet the doctor. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. Goodbye. I thought he was about to rip my ears off. Seriously. -Who is that monk? -I don't know. A relative, maybe? Aren't you hungry? Should we go eat something? I'll go and buy something. Stay here, I'll be back. She woke up after five years. Okay, try closing your hand. Open it up again. Put more strength into it. Fortunately, there is nothing wrong with her nerves. You need to continue to exercise your hands to relax the muscles. Practice using a spoon or chopsticks often. -Writing is fine, too. -Yes, Doctor. Walking is too much for now, so use the wheelchair. And the hospital prepared this congratulatory gift for you. Congratulations once again on waking up. -Thank you. -Thank you. Congratulations. Who is it? It's the girl who woke up after being in a coma for five years. The long term patient? I'm glad to hear she's awake. Hyun-ji... KIM HYUN-JI, FEMALE, 24 Is she really... She's Hyun-ji. Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji. What's wrong? Hey! -I have to find Hyun-ji. -No. Wait a minute! Sit down! Wait. You're burning up. The doctor says you have to be calm. Stay still, okay? Cheon-sang! Bong-pal! I'm so glad you're here, In-rang. He's frantic to find Hyun-ji. -I saw Hyun-ji! -What? You saw Hyun-ji? Yes, at the hospital ward on the way here. What nonsense are you spouting? How can you see a ghost? No, she looked exactly like Hyun-ji... No, she's Hyun-ji for sure. The name tag next to her room says Kim Hyun-ji too. Come here. You're burning up too, so get a shot while you're here. No! People are saying that she woke up from a five-year coma! Hey, Bong-pal! Move! He was just getting stabilized! Why did you have to bring up Hyun-ji? -It's that way! -Bong-pal! Where did he go? Bong-pal. Bong-pal. KIM HYUN-JI, FEMALE, 24 Hyun-ji. You're alive. I thought you disappeared. What are doing? Hyun-ji. Who are you? You... don't recognize me? Who are you? I'm Bong-pal. Don't you remember me? Look... I don't know how you know my name. But I really don't know who you are. Please leave. -Hyun-ji. -Mom. Who is he? Do you know him? No, I don't know him. Who are you? I'm sorry. I must've mistaken you for someone else. What the heck? Hey. It's Hyun-ji, right? What did she say? What did Hyun-ji say? She... doesn't remember me. -What? -She doesn't remember? Yes. Are you sure that's Hyun-ji? I'm sure. Look at her. There's no one prettier than Hyun-ji in all of Korea. -In all of Korea? -Yes. She is pretty, I guess. I don't know. Hi. Oh no, she must not remember me either. How can she remember you when she can't even remember Bong-pal? But why can't she remember? -She was in a coma for five years? -Yeah. Then you're saying Hyun-ji was a soul, not a ghost, right? I guess she was in limbo. She came back into her own body and forgot everything that happened with us. What do you want me to do? Excuse me... beautiful nurse. -Yes. -We have some questions to ask. Sure, go ahead. Who is he? Do you know him? No, I don't know him. Bong-pal! Monk Myung-cheol. Who said you can go home? I looked for you everywhere. -How did you find me? -Your seniors or whatever told me. I can't believe you're friends with idiots like that. They'll do you no good. Are you all right? -Yes. -You stupid brat. Let's go. You have to eat well at a time like this. Taxi! Hurry up. Over here. Stop the car! Wow, the quality of this oxtail is good. -Monk, I'll do it. -Go away. I can do this better than you. -I'm fine. I'll do it. -Listen, will you? Go and get some rest. Okay. -Monk Myung-cheol. -What is it? I'm sorry for yelling at you last time. That rascal even knows how to apologize. He's all grown up. Let's see here. Bong-pal. Bong... Bong-pal. Bong-pal. Bong... Bong-pal. -Bong-pal. -Bong-pal. -Senior. -Here. You came here to bring me this. -I could've come and gotten it. -Well, we need to talk too. -What is it? -The thing is... So, you're not the only one that Hyun-ji can't remember. They say she can't remember what happened five years ago. Hyun-ji was a victim of a hit-and-run accident. I think she has problems remembering because of trauma. The amnesia is only temporary. Her memories will return in time, so don't be so disappointed. We should be ecstatic and grateful that Hyun-ji is alive. And at times like this, you should be by her side, don't you think? You punks! Who came back alive from a hit-and-run accident? -Hello, sir. -Hello, sir. It's nothing. What? Bong-pal left his bag behind and we brought it for him. We'll be on our way now. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. See you later. Bong-pal, is Hyun-ji alive then? Yes, she's in the hospital I was staying at. That child was not a ghost. Unbelievable. He should be jumping up and down with joy. Why does he look so down? We should be ecstatic and grateful that Hyun-ji is alive. And at times like this, you should be by her side, don't you think? Are you okay after saying all that to him? -About what? -Well... You're trying to get Hyun-ji and Bong-pal together. Have you completely given up on her then? Hyun-ji's happiness is my happiness. I'm good as long as she's happy. Plus, there's something more important than that. What is it? We have to catch that punk and get revenge. -Who? -The bastard that put her in a coma five years ago. It's my life's mission to catch him. -Cheon-sang. -Yeah? Do you have that detective's business card? -Business card? -Which we got from that detective... The business card we got when Sadako died. Ah! I have it, I have it, I have it. I do have it. Here it is. Let's go. To the police station. Let's go! To the police station! POLICE STATION Goodness, it's not even a case. Why did you come all the way here? There's something I need to find out personally. This is already 18 years ago. See? It's a simple accident. There isn't much information on it. Does this apartment still exist? Why? You want to go there? Yes. See? Yes. This is the apartment building where the person lived. So... It's around here. When we arrived, the person was already dead. The skull was ruptured and it's likely that... he died from excessive bleeding. One of the residents discovered the body while passing by. She said she didn't see him fall. That's what happened. Is anyone there? Someone help! A straight fall from the 15th floor. What? You want to go up to the 15th floor? -Hello. -Who are you? -We called you earlier. -Ah, yes. -We're from the police station. -I see. -Please excuse us for a moment. -Please excuse us for a moment. It's nothing really. This detective is from Seoul and he just wants to take a quick look around. -It'll only be for a moment. -Sure, go ahead. There was no self-defense whatsoever. It's hard to say it was manslaughter. And there was no letter or statement left behind to indicate it was suicide. It was written on the autopsy report that he drank a lot. So he drank, smoked, and did this. He lost his balance. He tilted over and lost his balance. Do you remember who there was at that time? When I went up... the wife was there. She didn't know that her husband fell. Was the son at home by any chance? Joo Hye-sung. He was 13 years old at the time. Yes, the son was home. -Yeah, what is it? -Senior, where are you right now? -Did you get something? -The chief is looking all over for you. -You need to get back now. -I'm on my way. Why are you so concerned with a simple freak accident? -Did you find something? -I don't think it was a freak accident. What? The railing is about one meter tall. Joo Hye-sung's father was five feet, eight inches tall. Even if he stood by the railing, it'd be hard for him to fall over on his own. Unless someone pushed him from behind. The only people who were home were the wife and Joo Hye-sung. So, what are you going to do? I'm going to reinvestigate Professor Joo Hye-sung. HANIL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL Slowly. Very good. Pull a little more. -Are you comfortable? -Yes. I'm going to increase the speed a little. Hello? Yes. -Let's stop here for today. -Okay. Be careful. You're doing very well. The muscles are responding well, so you should be able to use crutches. Even though it's hard, you have to keep it up. I will. Where did my mom go? -Should I take you to your room? -No, I'll do it. -This is considered exercise too. -Okay then. -Thank you. -Good job today. -Hello. -Hello. Hello, Doctor. -Hello, Miss Hyun-ji. -Hello. This is a piece of cake. Are you okay? Yes. You look tired. Where is your room? I'll take you there. Thank you. You're welcome. You must be new to wheelchairs. You looked very clumsy. Ah, yes. I've only been using it for several days. You should be careful. It's actually quite harder than it looks. -Are you a doctor here? -No. I used to volunteer at a hospital, which is when I tried one out. I hear you were in a coma for five years. Oh, how did you find out? What kind of accident was it? A hit-and-run accident. But the truth is, I don't remember. -Not even remotely? -Yes. The doctor says it's because of the shock. But he says my memories will return with time. What a relief. -Hyun-ji. -It's my mom. Mom. Where were you? I was looking all over for you. Who is he? Ah, this person escorted me. Really? Thank you. -You're too kind. -Not at all. I'll be on my way now. -Good luck. -Yes, thank you. Who is he? He is so good-looking. He's exactly my type. A present for you. What is it? This is mine? -Yes. -Thank you! Nice. Come in. What the heck? He's here again. I'm not a strange person, so don't be afraid of me. I want to apologize for last time. I didn't know you lost your memories. What are you doing? It's my student ID. I'm a sophomore business major at Myeongseong University. -Call the school if you doubt me. -Why did you come again? You'll regret treating me like this once your memories return. Regret, my butt. Just who are you to keep bothering me like this? Park Bong-pal. Park Bong-pal? Yes, Park Bong-pal. Your boyfriend. -Granted, you don't remember. -What? Boyfriend? Yes. We were an item? I dated you? Yes. No, it's more like we lived together. That's a more accurate expression. What are you saying? Why would I live with you? When? -When you were a ghost. -What? A ghost? -You've lost your mind! -I'm perfectly fine. You chased me around. No way. You're not my type. Get out. You don't have to remember right away. I'm grateful that you're alive and well and haven't disappeared. -You bought a new cell phone. -Gosh, what are you doing? I'm giving you my number. Call me if you miss me. Get out! -I came back to return your stuff today. -Today? -You're coming again tomorrow? -Yes. Don't ever come again. I swear I'll call the cops on you if you come tomorrow! I'm coming tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. I'm going to come every day until you remember. Every single day. See you tomorrow. Ah... and call me if you want to hear my voice. MY LOVE BONG BONG What a crazy bastard! What is it? What's wrong? Did something happen? No, it's nothing. -Did you buy this? -No! Just throw it all away. The books too. It's the exact same thing you used before. -Really? -Really. You always used a pink cup and toothbrush. -Did I? -You did. Ever since you were little. You threw such a fit if I bought you a different color. -Mom, wait. -What is it? Just leave it there for now. You're so wishy washy. Here. Let's see here. BONG-PAL HYUN-JI This looks like my handwriting. Hey, Kim Hyun-ji. What is it? Are you in pain? My head hurts. Hyun-ji. -Let's go. -Sure. THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE For a patient who was in a coma for five years, your recovery speed is amazing. -You're in great condition too. -Really? When do I get discharged then? It's so stuffy in here. At this rate, you can start receiving outpatient treatment in three days. Yes! Is he not here today? It's strange not seeing him. No, what am I talking about? -Hello, everyone. -Hello. I am going to introduce you to a new friend today. This fellow's name is Happy. -And he's three years old. -It's that guy from last time. What is he doing? What are all of your names? Can you please introduce yourself to Happy? -Yes! -You go first. -Hi, I'm Ji-woo. -Hi, Ji-woo. -Hi, I'm Hyun-soo. -Hi, Hyun-soo. -Hi, I'm Seo-woo. -Hi, Seo-woo. Now that we've introduced ourselves, how about we get friendlier with Happy? Yes! All you have to do is gently pet him, okay? Yes. Gently. Happy might get scared. -Hi. -Be gentle. He's so cute. He's so soft and cute. -Thank you. -Bye. Yes, goodbye. Bye, see you next time. You look much better. I see that you can walk now. Yes. He's so cute. You said you do volunteer work. Do you volunteer here as well? -Yes. -What did you just do now? Pet therapy. It helps patients recover from or better cope with health issues. It's a type of psychotherapy. I probably need it too. Of course. -Do you want to hold him? -Yes. Here you go. -His name is Happy. -Hi, Happy. Excuse me, is this Kim Hyun-ji's room? Yes, that's correct. How did you get here? -Did she go somewhere? -Yes, she left for physical therapy. Who are you? I... don't know Hyun-ji that well. By any chance, are you her mother? Yes. Congratulations on your daughter waking up. This is my gift. -Thank you. -I'll get going. Wait, sir. Who should I say came to visit her? Tell her a mean monk who once said some harsh words to her came. Please tell her I'm sorry. Have a good day. Ah, so you're a professor. No wonder. The school you're teaching at is the school I wanted to attend. I was going to apply to Myeongseong University before the accident. I'd probably be graduating by now. Come visit the school once you're discharged and attend one of my classes. -Really? I can do that? -Of course. I get discharged in three days. Can I come then? -Yes. -Yay! Why is that punk here? Monk Myung-cheol. Hey, Bong-pal. -What are you doing here? -Oh, just because. Why are Hyun-ji and the professor together? Hyun-ji? Ah, the girl next to that professor is Hyun-ji, huh? Yes. Monk Myung-cheol. Monk Myung-cheol! It's nothing. I'm going to leave first. Oh my goodness. You look happy today. I was very happy before I saw you. I was wondering why you didn't come today. -Were you waiting for me? -You wish! Wait... Do you remember anything? Go to a mental institute and stop bothering me! What about lunch? Did you eat? What's it to you if I eat or not? It's boring eating hospital food every day. I packed a lunch today. Let's go eat it together. No, thank you. You eat it. It's Jangjorim and grilled meat. Meat? Yes, meat. Here, dig in. Just because I'm eating this doesn't mean that I've opened up to you. I'm only tasting it out of courtesy. Okay, just give it a taste. Shall I then? It's Kimchi stew. You have to put... -tons of meat... -tons of meat in it. I did. Eat it. You're pretty good. Here, rolled eggs. You like this. You've been stalking me, haven't you? How can you know everything I like? -You chased me. -Don't be ridiculous. Don't lie. Here. How can I like all these dishes? You're a pretty good cook. Whether you're a ghost or human, that hearty appetite is still the same. It's meat! I don't know what you're up to. But it won't go your way. -Hello. -Goodness, hello. Hello. Is Professor Joo Hye-sung in? He's not here right now. What brings you here? I just wanted to say hello. -When will he return? -He'll be back in about an hour. -Should I give him a call? -No, that's not necessary. I'll come again. By any chance... may I use the bathroom? Of course! The bathroom is downstairs. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Kim Hyun-ji? Why is her student ID here? -You're back, Director. -You came back early. Yes, the appointment was canceled. -Everything's fine? -Yes. Ah, Director. Someone is here to see you. -Who? -The monk who came last time. He's in the bathroom right now. Goodness... the professor is here. This is not the bathroom. -I think you're lost. -No kidding. I went into the wrong room. I'm so full. Since I ate all your dishes for you, I'm going to leave now. Already? Stay a bit longer. I'm bored. Considering your effort, I'd like to stay, but it's time to see the doctor. I'm going. Hand me my crutches. Hey. -I'll walk you to your room. -It's fine. I can do it myself. -Let me go with you. -I said it's fine! What the heck are you doing? You were falling. We almost kissed! I haven't had my first kiss yet. That's... not true. Then... You pervert! -Hey! -Do you want to die? My first kiss what? I told you not to mess around with me! Jerk. She's such a good fighter. It feels good to hit him. Where have you been? -I went for a short walk. -Let's go in. -Thank you. -Be careful when you walk. I will. The professor is off today, so I came in his place. -Are you comfortable. -Yes. Oh, I don't see Doctor Kim Jeong-woo either. Pardon? Who? Doctor Kim Jeong-woo. You know, the really tall guy. Who? We don't have a doctor by that name. Rest up then. -Thank you. -Rest up. My cell phone. I must've dropped it on the roof. She's so clumsy. CRAZY STALKER Kim Jeong-woo... Kim Jeong-woo? I've heard that name somewhere. Do you know a Kim Jeong-woo? Kim Jeong-woo? Who used to work at our hospital? You know him? You don't know him? About 10 years ago, that doctor died in our hospital. DR KIM JEONG-WOO That doctor killed patients in the operating room. Not only in our hospital, but also in the previous hospital where he worked. He killed patients during surgery. Look at him. Right behind you. -There's blood all over him. -I can't believe it. Why does he have blood all over him? Once the police started to investigate, he killed himself in one of our offices. Bong-pal! Pull it tight! What are you doing? Joo Hye-sung, a professor at Myeongseong University. You'll find something on him. Is it a gift? -For your girlfriend? -Yes. -You may leave now. -Where's Bong-pal? You don't know what kind of person he is. Professor Joo will be in charge of Miss Hyun-ji's psychotherapy. I'm leaving tomorrow. He said he'd come, but he's not here. It's certain that you had it. All the evil acts you committed will come back to haunt you.
