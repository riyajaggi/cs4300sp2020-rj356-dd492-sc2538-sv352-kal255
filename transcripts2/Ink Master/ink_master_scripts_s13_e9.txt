 Congratulations, guys. - Awesome. - Yeah. announcer:  In the elimination tattoo, the West and South  were targeted. {\an1}- They're gonna come for us. announcer: But the East  struggled to survive. {\an1}- I actually don't like coffee. {\an1}Could you change it into, like, a jar of jam? - My team's definitely in hot water here. - I'm stressed out. announcer:  In the elimination, Jessa, K, and Jordi  were the bottom three artists. - You've gotta push the envelope. {\an8}- I'm exhibiting the brightest color,

 {\an8} especially if I look  at Jordi's tattoo. {\an8}I am-- - You have the worst outline. {\an8}- Jordi's, man, the bottom part of this tattoo {\an8} is one of the illegible  tattoos of the day. {\an1}That's one of the big killers. - Jordi, you do not have what it takes to be Ink Master. [epic music] ♪ ♪ announcer:  11 artists remain, but only one will earn  a $100,000 prize {\an1} and the title of Ink Master. [rock music] {\an8} ♪ ♪ [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ {\an1}- [sighs] That was my last team member. {\an1}Like, that was, that was the end of team South. {\an1}Now it's just team solo. - From one perspective, you can say that, like, you're down a bunch of hands, and it's just you, but we all came in here thinking we were gonna be by ourselves anyway. {\an1}- Yep. - So in a way, like, your kind of untethered. {\an1}- You know, there's been a weight, like, on me, {\an1}coming in and having to be a returning veteran {\an1}for a team of people. {\an1}I think there's a part of me that's kind of thankful {\an1}that I'm on my own now. {\an3}- You get to be a true wild card, and I have no clue what you're gonna do. {\an1}- I don't even know what I'm gonna do, {\an1}but there is an excitement that kind of comes in {\an1}to knowing that I can make any decision that I want to make. {\an8} ♪ ♪ - What the hell? - Are we going fishing? - Welcome. 11 artists remain. Four in the West, three in the Midwest, three in the East, and only one artist in the South. The teams are definitely getting smaller, but ten artists still stand in your way of $100,000, a feature in "Inked" Magazine, and the title of Ink Master. - This week, we're testing artistry. - Nice.  Hell, yeah. {\an8}Artistry is what I live by. It's tattooed on my jaw. {\an8} - Artistry is what makes you  a unique person. {\an8}If you don't have artistry, {\an8}you're most likely gonna work at a used video store. - Today, you must create an incredible work of art that is literally suspended in thin air. - What the [bleep]? - Well, this'll be fun. - Using nothing but hundreds of thousands of multi-colored buttons and transparent fishing line, you must strategically string button after button to bring a mind-bending, suspended masterpiece to life. - What the hell? - This shit just keeps getting crazier. - Yeah. {\an1}- I can't even sew a button on a shirt. We're literally sculpting {\an8}on a million different pieces of string, with thousands upon thousands  of buttons. Does that not sound insane to anyone else? {\an1}- A single button out of place can destroy the entire effect. {\an1}- [bleep] buttons, bro. - There is one more thing you should know. - Of course. There's always one more thing. - In times of war, sometimes you must cross enemy lines. - What the hell? - For this flash challenge, your team will battle alongside another region, and together, you will win or lose the advantage. - So much for being just a team. {\an1}- I just like our core four. - I was looking  at these buttons, {\an8}thinking there's no way that I'm gonna be able {\an8}to pull this shit off, so I'll take some extra hands. 'Cause it's just me. - To determine which regions work together, you'll draw skulls. On the bottom of one of the skulls is an X. Get the X, and you will get to pick which region you want to work with this flash challenge. {\an1}- Better get that damn X. - The picking order has been randomly assigned. Midwest, you get to draw for the X first. {\an8} [tense music] {\an8}- Come on, big daddy, get that X. {\an8} ♪ ♪ - East, you're next. ♪ ♪ No X. - You had one job. - I know. - West. ♪ ♪ - Damn. - All right, obviously the X goes to the South. Jason, come on up, do the honors. {\an8} ♪ ♪ - What region would you like to team up with? - [sighs]  I can pick West. It evens the amount of people facing off against each other. My other choice would be  to pick one of the other teams {\an8}and sabotage their project, but that guarantees {\an8}that there's no way that I have skull pick. I'm gonna go with West. - The West it is. All right, South and West, {\an1}you will be working together as one team, and that means, Midwest and East, you'll form the second team. {\an1}- This is gonna be dope. All right. - The winners of this flash challenge will have the power to assign all of the human canvases in the elimination tattoo together. - You have seven hours, and your time starts now. [rock music] {\an8} - This week, we're testing artistry, {\an8}and for this flash challenge, just to get a concept and a strategy is gonna be the hardest part about this design. {\an1}- So I was thinking, like, a volcano, {\an1}with like a smoke ring, {\an1}'cause you could suspend that, with lava, with lava just shooting out. - I also thought of jellyfish. - I do like the idea of a jellyfish. This one is so organic-- - And moving. - That it's gonna be kind of harder to mess up. - I love this idea. I'm gonna color organize the buttons. {\an1}- All right, cool. While that happens, {\an1}I want somebody, if we can, just to put a couple on there {\an1}and see how it goes. {\an1}Jerrel's usually really efficient with that stuff. {\an1}- Tougher challenges like this really push people to the limit. {\an1}- I want to see here, I want to go around and hear everyone's. {\an1}What are you thinking? - I was thinking about jellyfish. - Jellyfish would be cool. - Would jellyfish be recognizable, though, as a jellyfish? We could have a Jack in the box. {\an1}- I like the fact that they're boxes, {\an1}and I got an idea for that in a second. Jerrel? - I haven't heard half your guys' ideas. - Cool. What are yours? - I was thinking about a hand, like a 3D printer, like going like this. - Not a hand. - Yeah, so.  We get an artistry challenge, {\an8}and my opinion doesn't matter to 'em. I have artistry tattooed  right across my jaw for a reason. Come on. I work fast, so just lay it out so we can [bleep] do it. - I'm going to get everything else out of the way. {\an1}- You have to work up and then down, {\an1}out, and then make the shape. - We need to know the grid, so we can figure out the grid, and then we can slide and remove things at will. {\an1}- I mean, it's one of those things just gonna-- we have to freehand. - I think Jason's right. This has to be more, like, eyeballed and freehanded. {\an1}- Exactly. - I don't trust Jason  by any means. {\an8}Any opportunity he has, he might [bleep] us over. They're literally making a grid. - But do they have any buttons on yet? - No. - Nothing. {\an1}I think that they're gonna greatly underestimate how long it's gonna take to put any kind of buttons on. ♪ ♪ {\an1} - We got four feet, it's 48 of these [bleep]. {\an1}If we were to use ten of them {\an1}for the circumference of the thing, that's almost a foot. - Well, let's call it 18, because that's relatively divisible in the same terms. {\an1}- Where do you get this mathematician from? {\an1}He's a genius. - I have a state medal in the mathematics competition. - You what? - It's dumb. {\an1}- I wouldn't say that's dumb, I think it's impressive. You want to talk about dumb things, I'm your guy. - Five hours to go, everybody. Five more hours. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ - Okay, wait, what's going on here? - We're putting on a few. - Uh, don't do that yet. - What do you-- - We don't-- I don't think we have one on yet. Wait, hold on. - Just do your thing. Let's be mathematical about this shit, and take our [bleep] time. Let's do that. {\an8}- Something seems up with Jerrel. He's showing signs of  not being on the same page as the rest of the alliance. We need to stick together. How you feeling? - [bleep] irritated. I feel like everybody thinks I'm, like, [bleep] stupid. - This challenge is very mentally taxing, and I'm trying to  help the team and make sure that they all feel good. {\an1}I don't think we've talked about it yet, {\an1}but I also have anxiety sometimes, {\an1}so I'm going to take a step back for one second. ♪ ♪ - This tentacle's, like,  almost not making any sense. They're all [bleep]ed up. That's all tangling up together. - I guarantee this is a huge knot now. - We get to the point  that we don't even know what we're doing. {\an1}- Oh, my God. - The more we try to rush through it, {\an1}the [bleep] messier it gets. ♪ ♪ - I can't imagine  that this is the way that the Midwest usually works with each other. Jerrel's ready to flip tables.  I mean, this is insane. {\an1}- How we doing? - Just trying to, like, tie it and hold, you know? - [sighs] Okay. {\an8}- Daddy Snaz is gonna have to get in there {\an8}and get some shit done. [imitates child] Ooh, buttons! [laughter] - Okay. - Here comes something. - Wait, is Squishy back? - I like buttons. - [laughs] - What kind of things do you like to button? - No, not that again. My God. {\an8}- [laughs] Daddy's got the sauce! - This is your final hour, guys. Final hour. ♪ ♪ - How many idiots does it take to make a yellow ball? - Mm-hmm. {\an8}We already have more art than they do. {\an1}Let's not make it today that they do. ♪ ♪ - Five, four, three, two, one. That's it, time is up. This challenge is over. {\an8}- Well, I had to work with team West today, but-- {\an7}- I definitely hate you guys less than I hate those guys. {\an8}- Yeah, yeah. - We'll take it. {\an8}- Yeah. - All right, guys, it is time to critique your work. West and South, let's start with you. - In an artistry challenge, using a free form and choosing a jellyfish  is a very wise choice, because at least you have  all that flow and that movement to it. But I don't know that anybody's going to look at it and immediately say "jellyfish." Could be octopus, could be something  that's free form in the sea. - And I like that you swung for an idea that was suspended. It's almost as if  you created this whole thing into a tank  that has this jellyfish. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Looks like a jellyfish. - Yeah. {\an1}- I mean, it's hard. - East and Midwest, you're up next. - On artistry, I don't think you're doing {\an1} some elaborate image, but it  does work out to be legible, and you do get a sense  of the shape of the box in a 3D image. I think you made a smart play. - Can we all just look at Angel's face when we win? I wanna see Angel do her scowl. [scowls] - Shut the [bleep] up. - All right, judges, it is time to determine a winner of this flash challenge. - For me, artistry falls in the creation. To come up with a plan  that was more recognizable plays stronger. - Part of artistry has got  to be the finished product being legible. My vote is for the Midwest and the East. - Yes. - My vote is for the Midwest and the East. {\an1}- Thank you. ♪ ♪ {\an1} - The judges have decided, the winner of this flash challenge is the Midwest and the East. - Thanks, guys. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - This is bullshit. {\an8}We've got to stop them from winning {\an8}any more flash challenges. We've been on the defense  for three weeks now. - Congratulations. {\an1}You'll have the power to assign all of the human canvases... - Yes! - In the elimination tattoo, together. You can all head back to the loft. {\an1}- Let's do it, huh? - We're getting the ribs. It's a given. - Shots fired. {\an1}- I'd like to go a little overboard. - I'm not worried about Jason. - [laughs] [suspenseful music] {\an3} - As an artist, I respect you, and I'm at that point where I don't know who to talk to on my own team because my team is starting {\an3}to not listen to what I'm saying. During the flash challenge, every idea I had kind of just was ignored. {\an1}- In my opinion, like, {\an1}you're a way better artist than K and Jessa. {\an1}If they're just listening to their advice over yours {\an1}when you're on their team, that's kind of, like, {\an1}weird that they'd be like, {\an1}well, we're just gonna trust this other team. - It's starting to really [bleep] piss me off. Look, at the end of the day, I would rather compete with true artists. - Mm-hmm. - The West has that. So for me, personally, what I'm not going to do is protect K. She should've gone home way before Jordan. {\an1}- Oh, yeah. [tense music] ♪ ♪ - Welcome to the elimination tattoo. Based on your work, one of you will lose your shot at the title of Ink Master. - At least it's not a double elimination. - Remember, both Chris and Oliver still have the power to pardon one artist each. {\an1}If an artist receives a pardon, they will immediately reenter the competition. {\an1}- Can't count on that. - Today, you must tattoo... ♪ ♪ a pinup. - Pinups. - Boy. - We are looking for a full head-to-toe pinup tattoo. - [bleep] full body? - Full body. - I've never done a pinup  in my life. {\an8}When you have to do a face that's the size of a quarter, {\an1} that's not a fun face to do. {\an1} - Some of the worst disasters we've seen in this competition have been on pinup day. Anatomy, proportion, the way things fit together. It's supposed to be an attractive, beautiful, appealing tattoo. {\an1}It's supposed to look human. {\an1}- Make your tattoos pop, guys. It's your safety, and it can also be your demise. - Remember, the team whose artist wins tattoo of the day will select one other team to form the jury of peers. Together, both teams will deliberate and put one artist up for elimination. {\an1}- Fair enough. - Let's meet your canvases. ♪ ♪ Midwest and East, you won the flash challenge. You now have the power to assign the human canvases together. - Want to go, hot stuff? - Let's do it. - I love when the Midwest  has skull picks, because every single time  they do, {\an8}they think they're screwing me, {\an8}and then I end up doing really well. {\an1}- Sup, man. What do you wanna get done? {\an3}- New school Colorado snow bunny, holding a snowboard. - That's pretty cool. - Detroit motor city pinup {\an3}with impact wrench with an air hose. {\an8}- Detroit motor city pinup. Is that a style? {\an8}I don't want it. I don't even know what that is. {\an8}- Mardi gras pinup, with beads, on my calf. {\an8}- A million perfect circles next to each other? {\an8}Are you kidding? No thank you to the beads. - New school Las Vegas pinup with a poker background on my ribs. - Okay. On your ribs? - On my ribs. - Holy [bleep]. Poker chips and a background,  and it's on the ribs? {\an8}This one is going over to the West, I can guarantee it. - American football pinup on my ribs. I've been lied to before. I don't know. {\an1}- Yeah, you guys are always lying about the ribs. {\an1}Tell me something that's gonna make me believe you. - I don't want a hairy pinup on my leg. - Fair enough. - Wow. - We're getting the ribs. That's a given. - Listen, if you get ribs, just tell them no. {\an3}You can't do a body on the ribs. It's [bleep] stupid. - For me, I say Bob, Raul, and Angel {\an1}should get the hardest ones. I'm not worried about Jason. - Me either. ♪ ♪ - All right, we got this. - All right. {\an7}- Having the skull picks again {\an8}is the best kind of double edged sword {\an8}you could ever have. - You're gonna have fun. - Okay. {\an1}- It hasn't always worked out. - Here you go, brother man. - Thanks, man. - But having the ability to choose instead of being given something is something I will choose every time. {\an1}- [laughs evilly] - Canvases, one by one, {\an1}please read the artist's name on the bottom of your skull. - Frank. - Yes, sir. - Kelly. - Hi. - I want to know who took the damn snow bunny, because that's the best one up there. ♪ ♪ - Jason. - You're welcome. - Wow. Sweet. Thank you, man. I appreciate it. - Jerrel. - Hey. - K. - Hi there. - Jessa. - Hey. - Jimmy. {\an8} ♪ ♪ {\an8}- Hiram. - Gotcha, brother. {\an8}- Damn. {\an8}- Gonna have to do a lot of explaining, bro, {\an8}because I have no idea what you want. {\an7}- Or me, I think. ♪ ♪ - Raul. - Right here. - Oh, shit. - Shots fired. {\an8} - God damn it,  another rib tattoo. {\an8}I am sick of being handed some bullshit. - This guy, he definitely seems like he's adamant about the ribs. - He is. - Bob. - Yep. - There it is. - I knew it. Always giving me the ribs. - Better him than you. - Angel. - Hi! {\an1} My team has two rib pieces, an old guy,  and this other biker dude who looks like he's gonna  beat Hiram's ass. {\an7}I think that was a shot fired. - You'll have six hours to tattoo a pinup. Fail to create a dream girl and you can kiss your dream of $100,000 good-bye. Good luck. - In this challenge,  we're looking for more than just a standard, traditional pinup. {\an1} We're looking for artistry. {\an1}- I'd like to sometimes go a little overboard. - Do something amazing with the clothes, do something with the background. {\an1}- When you think Mardi Gras, {\an1}like, you think, what, like a mask and, like, beads? - I like the mask idea. {\an8}- One of the biggest problems we see on pinup day {\an1} is crazy anatomical mistakes. {\an1} The structure of the person has to be  aesthetically pleasing. If something is a little bit off, it's totally [bleep]. {\an1}- First thing's first, {\an1}about whether or not you want it on the ribs. {\an1}It's one of the most painful areas on the body. {\an1}You're not gonna get the best tattoo. {\an1}You want the best tattoo, maybe that lower leg {\an1}or something like that, maybe you could get more out of it. - We could do that. We could do that. {\an1}- All right, I appreciate that. - I'm not afraid to tattoo your ribs, if you confidently can tell me that you could sit to the maximum of six hours-- - I gotcha, I gotcha. - Without moving, you know, just staying calm. - Okay, yeah. - Then I'm totally down. {\an3}- All right. - I keep getting thrown  these rib tattoos, {\an7}and, you know, I'm tired of it. {\an8}I'm not gonna change the rib tattoo, {\an8}and I'm gonna show everybody in the room {\an8}that I'm not afraid to tattoo ribs, {\an8}and I can do a [bleep] clean and solid job. - We're staying on the ribs, man. {\an1}- We got to do ribs, we're gonna do ribs. {\an1}It's gonna be--it's gonna be a battle for both of us. - Having her, like, hold an impact wrench, and then obviously it has, you know, an air hose, connected going into it. {\an8}- Honestly, I have no idea what my--what my canvas wants. {\an8}He's saying a lot of words that I don't-- {\an8}that I'm not able to catch. - With the rat rod itself, {\an3}and then the air hose going basically, like, around her nipples. - Every time  he talks about something {\an1} that is already complicated, he adds more things to it. - And then I don't know if it's possible to get a car in the background. - It's too many stuff. {\an1}We're not going to be able to accomplish that in six hours. ♪ ♪ [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ - I'm a little bit over it at this point. {\an1}- Just go simple. Don't overthink it. - I'm just stressed out, and I'm gonna end up stressing everybody else out. {\an1}- You're gonna stress me out more if you go home. {\an1}Just do a good, clean tattoo, you'll be fine. - It's a little wide for her. She's so narrow. {\an1}- Yeah, and this leg {\an1}doesn't look like it would make sense now. {\an8}- K does not have what it takes to be in this competition, {\an8}unless Jimmy's there holding her hand, {\an8}guiding her through everything she's doing. {\an1}- The way I see it, it's like, her leg needs to come up, like, there or something. - It's a tricky one. - K is screwed. ♪ ♪ - All right, artists, you have six hours to create a pinup tattoo, and your time starts now. - All right, brother. - Let's do this. - Stand natural for me. - Pinups are very tough, because there's very small,  little eyes, a very small,  little nose, {\an8}dainty little fingers, {\an8}so every drop of ink you put on the skin has to be perfect. {\an1}- I think that's a good spot. - It should be cute.  It should be attractive. It should be beautiful. That's what makes a pinup  a pinup. {\an1}- Perfect stencil, dude, it's gonna be a good day. - If a pinup's ugly, she's not coming to meet my mom. {\an1}- All right, here we go.

I need to buckle the [bleep] down {\an1} so that I can do this tattoo. - Have you always wanted to be a tattoo artist? {\an1}- Yeah, I was really young when I found out what tattooing was. {\an1}My dad's, like, really covered in tattoos. {\an3}- Oh, nice. - The first time that I ever  went to a tattoo shop, I went with my dad for one of his appointments, and it was just  like sensory overload. All these colors,  and all this art everywhere. It hit me hard. {\an1}Here we are now, tattooing a pinup on your leg. - Yeah, true. [laughs] ♪ ♪ - The face is the most important part, because that's right where they go into, there. - Can't jack up the face, man. - No. Pinups are not my thing, but I do a ton of faces and portraits, so with that, I'm good.

I need my canvas  to stay still. - Four hours. Four more hours to go, everybody. Four hours left. ♪ ♪ {\an1}- Actually, I had a pinup girl on me, and got it covered up. {\an7}The guy did a horrible job. {\an8}This canvas was definitely a shot at me, {\an8} but guess what, man? {\an8}I'm a canvas whisperer. {\an8} We came down from [bleep]  10,000 elements to three. I'm having a lot of fun, bro. - Good, man, I'm glad. - Even when I came to the states with no English, I still were able to survive, you know? Because I'm able to create  this interaction where people trust me. ♪ ♪ {\an1}- Now we're definitely glad we didn't go with the ribs. - Yeah, definitely. - That shit is no joke, man. {\an1}- I was trying to take it easy on you, {\an1}because it is a rib piece that we're trying to get done, {\an1}and normally, we'd take multiple sessions on those. {\an8}I didn't come into this competition to show that, like, {\an8}I could tattoo a thigh every day. [bleep] it.  I'm going to show them that I can tattoo any part of the body. {\an1}It'll be grand once it's done. {\an1}It'll be worth every second of pain. ♪ ♪ - Have you been doing this for a long time? - Tattooing? - Mm-hmm. {\an3}- I've been tattooing for three years. - Oh, wow. - Yeah, yeah. {\an1}So I'm the--I'm the baby here. - Aww. - The greenest one. I mean, I'm one of the oldest tattooers here, {\an3}but one of the least experienced. - Really? - Yeah. {\an8}- In this competition, might assume that I have {\an7}a lot more time under my belt, {\an8}simply because I'm one of the oldest people here. But I have the least amount  of experience {\an1} compared to everybody else. Obviously, like, these lines are my weakest lines, so I'm wondering if I should shade one way on it. - You can, like, bring it, like, shade from that way, like down like that? - Yeah, yeah. - You can. - Yeah. - I don't know why  she wanted this tattoo, because she has issues pulling lines in the first place. K needs to go home. - Three hours remaining. {\an1}Three hours remaining, guys. ♪ ♪ [tattoo machine buzzing] {\an1}- Oh, [bleep]. {\an1}[coughing] - You get tattooed and  you're not feeling too good, it makes it even worse.

Yeah, I'm not gonna tattoo you anymore. - Oh. You're not? - No. As a tattoo artist, you have to know when enough is enough. So, we're gonna call it right there, okay? - Okay.  - It's a good tattoo. It's done well. I just hope it's enough. - Thank you. Best. - Have a good day. {\an1}I hope you feel better, okay? - I think it's a winner, man.

I'm not that nice. {\an1}This is a competition. I'm trying to stay in this bitch. I'm not trying to go home. So, I think I know why I got this canvas. I think that they know, by  giving me a more simple idea, that there's a bigger chance  that I'm going to hang myself. I feel like if they're too straightforward, then something's got to be added. So, that's usually where I start to fault at. {\an3}- Is yours probably the biggest, from what you've seen? {\an1}- No, in fact, mine's even the lesser detail, {\an1}but that's because I want legibility. {\an8}The power has been in the Midwest {\an8}and East for far too long, but somebody on one of those  teams will drop the ball. It's gonna happen. ♪ ♪ - Five, four, three, two, one. That is it. Time is up. Machines down.

I think she's so beautiful. - Oh, she's gorgeous. - Yeah. Whoo. {\an1}- There's an inner struggle between the teams. - What they've set up is destined to self-destruct. - Small, little things play big tricks. {\an1}- This face is a mess. [suspenseful music] {\an1} - The girls on my team, they're in trouble. {\an1}I'm trying to figure out what I can do {\an1}for my team, to help them. - That's why I gravitate towards you, Jimmy. I see how you lead your team, and I know you guys have been fighting the entire way through. - Yeah. - When someone's in the bottom, it always helps to have somebody in the top. {\an3}If we can get tattoo of the day, then we have the opportunity to make a play down there. - I'm still in attack mode. - Sure. {\an1}- You know, that shit didn't end with those skull picks. {\an3}- Whoever is next to K and Jessa, if they're down there, they're not coming back up. {\an1}- We got to keep hitting the West, {\an1}because they need to lose somebody. {\an3}- Let's get it. {\an8} ♪ ♪ - Today, you had to show artistry, tattooing a pinup. Let's see how you did. East, let's start with you. Jimmy. ♪ ♪ {\an3}- Sup. {\an1}- Yeah, I really like this illustration. I love the skin tone  in this tattoo. Leaving the shirt almost  completely open works, because the shirt  is surrounded by color. - You're really leaning on leaving a lot of open skin now. You could've colored  your stars, {\an1} just little details to make it  look that much more finished. But the overall,  this is a great tattoo. It's a good job. - Thank you. - Good job, Jimmy. - Thanks. - Jessa. ♪ ♪ {\an8}I don't understand this shoe that I'm looking at. {\an8} I don't see how this  leg and knee is coming out, {\an8} and then swooping down around,  and coming straight down, {\an7} but in front of the other leg. {\an8} I don't know where that's  coming from, {\an7}and how it's making that turn. {\an1}- For a very simple drawing, it has to be right. You did those two brown lines  that come to the nostrils, and gave her zero nose. You definitely show some technical problems here today. - K. ♪ ♪ - Today's the day to do small details and do a cute face. I think you do that. But if you're gonna have  a hiccup in a line, hope it's not somewhere  like right on her chin. Since it's right there, it's jumping out. From her waist up, she's super cute. {\an1} Her proportions look right, and then the shape of that  thigh going into the knee, it doesn't look like  it's hers. - It raises some questions, anatomically. ♪ ♪ Midwest, you're next. Jerrel. ♪ ♪ - Hi, guys. - I really like this girl. I especially love the dark strip of shading  that you have down the center of her leg  that pushes out. That light source  is beautiful. And the way that you get  that nice, gentle soft texture in the shirt  really shows well. You're really shining on this one. - Thank you. - That's what's up. - Yeah. - [laughs] - Frank. ♪ ♪ - I like the image, but the way you  try to render this face, it's not gonna be long until this face is a mess. You'd be much better off with just the lines of the lips, just like you did the line of the eyebrow. Little black line,  little black line, and be done with it. It's so small. You just take it too far. - Kelly. ♪ ♪ - The tattooing  is very smooth. That outline, see how black that is, everybody? That's how the line's  got to look to win. - The whole thing  is really adorable. Really nice job. - Thank you. - Good job, Kelly, man. - Thanks, guys. - Next up is the South. Of course, that means Jason. ♪ ♪ {\an1}- This tattoo looks messy. It's weird because you have  super clean, rich black fading out to bright color  in one area, and then right on the other  side of the tattoo, you have a sketchy  not solid black, {\an1} with that chalky-look color. Your application's not consistent, even in an area that's only two inches away from where you did  really nice application. It's got to be consistent. - It went better than I thought it was gonna. - Yeah, yeah. - West, you're up. Bob. - This tattoo's really clean for the ribs. Your outline on this  is very nice. I like the divot  in the center of the arm, {\an7} and I really love the helmet. {\an8} Nice, light, dark black shaded  on the bottom. {\an1}- You prove yourself in this tattoo. - Good job, Bob. - Keep 'em coming, Frank. - [sighs] - Raul. ♪ ♪ - What's going on, fellas? - I like this little crazy, cute drawing. - I love the skin tone, just not afraid  to go rich and dark. And the way you put in  the blue highlights really make this thing pop,  man. Super cool tattoo. - Thank you. - Hell yeah. Killed it. New school excellent. - Hiram. ♪ ♪ - Her face is great. On a face this small, keeping  the eyes black like that really sinks them in and makes it look great. - You do have a couple of wonky lines going on in the tire,  but overall, man, I mean, that's a tough tattoo  to pull off, and I think you do a great job with it. {\an3}- Thank you. - Angel. - I really, really like this illustration. {\an1} The color play works great. I like the way  the legs are shaded, because it gives it that sheer look. - With the stockings and the strap, you're paying attention to the pressure  that this strap is putting on to the skin. That's a great testament  to your artistry. - I'm glad you noticed it. - I noticed it right away. - [bleep]. - All right, guys, time to determine who had the best tattoo of the day? - I will say this is one of the best pinup days we've ever had. - You guys killed it. - All right. - Hey, guys. - Jerrel is definitely in the top today. This thing is unique, it's done beautifully. - And I love Angel's. Everything about this tattoo,  the drawing, the color play. {\an8} Angel's is a much tougher  tattoo to do. {\an8} - Yeah.  - But Jerrel's, {\an1}the cleanliness is undeniable. ♪ ♪ {\an1}My vote's for Jerrel. - My vote's for Jerrel as well. - Jerrel. - Unanimous. - Thank you. - Damn. - Look at you, mother[bleep]. - The judges have decided that the best tattoo of the day goes to Jerrel. - [bleep]. {\an1}- He's got artistry on his face. - That means the Midwest will form a jury of peers with one other team. Jerrel, which team do you choose? ♪ ♪ {\an3}- Is there a question about this? {\an1}- Probably none. - East. - The Midwest and the East will form the jury of peers. You must deliberate and put one artist up for elimination. - All right. - You can head back to the loft. ♪ ♪ - I don't think Jerrel should have won tattoo of the day. I mean, I think Angel has a way stronger tattoo. {\an1}- Regardless of what we think, {\an1}he's won tattoo of the day twice, {\an1}and even though that he's doing better than Frank {\an1}in the competition, his team {\an1}is not giving him as much credit as he deserves. {\an1}And the decision-making {\an1}is all going towards Frank's decisions. - I mean, some people just want to be loyal to whatever the alliance is... - Frank wants to be loyal to the East. {\an3}Frank didn't give him any chance {\an1}to even deliberate that today. {\an1}- But that means that there's an inner struggle {\an1}between the team, and it's definitely gonna cause {\an1}a rift between that alliance, {\an1}and possibly the core of their team. - We were so worried about gaining the power back, and it's almost better this way. What they've set up is destined to self-destruct. All we have to do right now is just kind of help it along. {\an1}- Oh, yeah, just put a little fire under it. - Yeah. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ {\an1} - We, the Midwest, along with the East, as the jury of peers, {\an1}are here to decide what artist to send up for elimination. - Right. - Like, I know it's your guys' job to protect each other, but at the end of the day, I have to be true to how I feel. My vote is for you, K. I just feel like  there's application issues that hurt the design. - You guys can vote me down. I'll do it. I'll [bleep] scrap down there. - When it comes down to it, we have a voice. Are we owning our own shit and putting ourselves on a silver platter, or are we pointing out the flaws in the room? Because there was more than one person with flaws here. - It's true. - It is about strategy. You might have a chance to send Jason home, and he is a strong player. - Strategy doesn't necessarily work so well anymore. I have to stick true to how I feel in certain matters. {\an1}- And I respect your decision, {\an8}but I mean, face for face, the design of K's, I like better. {\an8} - The thing that bothers me  the most about Jason's tattoo is that we gave him exactly the piece that he wanted, and he did nothing with it. - I want to play with integrity, but at the same time, it's my job to protect my team. - So, today we're testing artistry with pinup tattoos. - Today I see the East in a lot of trouble. - We're talking about K. - That dark walnut brown. It looks scribbled over  with a crayon. {\an1} And then the red in the flame? Worst application of the day right there. {\an3}- Also Jessa's is very challenged. {\an1} - The nose with those lines causes for a weird  sunken-in face. - We're testing artistry, and this seems to be a miss. Let me ask you guys this. {\an1}I'm not understanding why Jason {\an1}as an artist isn't consistent. - He is confident  in his stuff, and the second  he gets something else, it goes out the window. - Color saturation in 70%  of the tattoo is terrible. {\an3}- It's wild. {\an1}- So, the Midwest and the East are deliberating right now, and they're gonna put an artist up for elimination. {\an1}- And we've yet for a team to send someone {\an1}of their own team down when they're deliberating. - Today would be the day that I would expect that to happen. ♪ ♪ [door opens, shuts] {\an1} - All right, jury of peers, which artist are you sending down for elimination? ♪ ♪ - The jury of peers has decided to send to the bottom... ♪ ♪ Jason. - All right, in the bottom, we'll see Jason, K... ♪ ♪ And Jessa. See ya'll downstairs. ♪ ♪ - I'm ready. They call me an asshole for a reason. Just letting you guys know. - We're all gonna be down there fighting for our own cause. {\an1}- Let's go face the music. ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - Today, you were being tested on artistry. {\an1}Based on your work, one of you will be packing your machines. Jerrel, why did the jury of peers vote Jason to the bottom? {\an1}- The jury of peers voted Jason to the bottom because of the applications  used in his tattoo. The saturation issues,  the line work issues. - I feel like Jason does better tattoos than this, {\an3}and that is why we voted that way. - First look at the tattoo, I think it's cute,  and I think it's legible. Do I think it's the worst? No. {\an1}- It comes down to the style of shading you do, {\an1}and really, you just don't commit to your tattoo. - Maybe I stumbled today, but I also know-- - But you--you-- - Hold on a second, I'm not finished. Mine's probably the better of the three. There's just some really crazy anatomical issues on the other two, and then one of them's just really overworked. {\an1}- K, the biggest issue is the application that's in this  big stand-up bass. It's the color choice,  and the way that it goes in. - As soon as I started doing it, I knew that it had been the wrong choice. I didn't want to give you guys just a pinup. {\an1}- All three of you on the line {\an1}hit some very strong shortcomings {\an1}against a field that was really, really talented today. - Jessa, the artistry is not the problem here. I look at most of the lines  in the tattoo and see that  they're not punched in, and see that  they're not solid. {\an3} - I started, like, an hour late, just because I re-drew a lot. I'd love the chance to keep getting better, because I'm a little bit more comfortable every time. - Do you think you can get out of your head? - I think I've been getting out of there, man. ♪ ♪ - All right, guys, time to determine who's going home. {\an8} - I see all three having  complications in application, {\an8}but Jason's drawing is more dynamic. {\an1}- My vote is not for Jason. ♪ ♪ - So, we're looking at between K and Jessa. This is between the East and the East. ♪ ♪ {\an8} - There's a little bit of  rough application in Jessa's, {\an7} but the roughest application  of the day is in K's tattoo. My vote's for K. - Application aside, just in terms of anatomically laid out, my vote's for K. - K. - The judges have decided. K, you do not have what it takes to be Ink Master. {\an1}- It takes a lot of guts and a lot of courage to show up here {\an1}with only three years under your belt. {\an1}Congratulations making it this far. - I am just incredibly grateful to have had this opportunity, and you guys are all my [bleep] family. - Come here, girl. - Please pack your machines and close shop. [epic music] ♪ ♪ - I'm sad to leave, but I'm very proud of the fact that, as hard as it was for me, like, I pushed as far as I could possibly go. I've learned so  much since I've been here, and I feel like this is a beginning for me. ♪ ♪ announcer: On the next episode  of "Ink Master"... - It's every artist for themselves. - Oh my God. {\an3}- We want to start seeing you swing. {\an1}- Throw me a pitch. {\an1}This is my chance to take someone home from the West. - I think it's time to retaliate. - I'm a shark. {\an3}If I smell blood, I'm coming for it. - This thing is jacked. - To bet your safety in the competition, it's a tough gamble. - She just quit.
