  male narrator: On the last  episode of "Ink Master"... - As far as the West goes, you guys drew a line and that's fine. But as soon as you drop the ball, I'm right [bleep] there. You just keep losing teammates, one after another. - Who just went home? - Our first one. narrator:  In the flash challenge, the Midwest aimed  to retake control of the game. - The winner of the flash challenge is... the Midwest. - Yes. narrator: In the elimination  tattoo,

 the Midwest  fired on their enemies. - [whispers] I'm excited for you guys. You are [bleep] today. narrator:  But their plan backfired. - The farther I get in my tattoo, the more worried I get. I didn't come all the way to New York to go home. - I don't want to see you go home either. narrator:  In the elimination, Raul, Jordi, and Jordan were the bottom three  artists. {\an8}- Seeing the three of these things together, {\an8} the one that has the least  amount of contrast to me {\an8}is Jordan's.

 {\an8} - I dislike  that kraken immensely. {\an8}But to pick a baseball bat that's not a baseball bat.... - The perspective  on the drawing, it looks like a glass,  it looks like a pin. - It doesn't look like a bad application. For me, Jordan is safe. - She is not safe. - Jordan, you do not have what it takes to be Ink Master. {\an1} narrator: 12 artists remain, but only one will earn  a $100,000 prize {\an1} and the title of Ink Master. [rock music] {\an8} ♪ ♪ {\an8} [dramatic music] {\an8} ♪ ♪ - One of the bigger teams can be losing a player, or the smallest team in the house could be losing its only other [bleep] team member. So, from then on, we'll just call it East, Midwest, West, and Jason. - Yeah. - [laughs] [door opens] - It was pretty brutal. - [bleep] brutal. - Oh, that's a horrible [bleep] sign. - Yeah. - What's up, man? {\an3}- Can't stop, won't stop. - So that shit was crazy. - I did not [bleep] see that coming, at all. - None of us did. Put people up in the bottom against Raul, they go home. - That's for sure. - I'm pissed. I should've [bleep] been down there. Jordan, now that she's gone, like, I don't know--everybody better [bleep] be ready. So nobody better drop the ball, because you will go home. - Welcome. Only 12 artists remain. Four in the West, three in the Midwest, two in the South, and three in the East. As this turf war constantly changes, one thing remains the same. Only one of you will earn $100,000, {\an1}a feature in "Inked" magazine, {\an1}and the title of Ink Master. - Right. - Once again, today, {\an1}there is no flash challenge. - Shit. - I get nervous every time he says that. - Your next elimination tattoo is starting right now. - [bleep] - And this week, we're testing adaptability. - Ugh. - It's not a good word. - Different skins,  different styles. {\an8}If you're unable to adapt, you're not an Ink Master. {\an8}You don't deserve to win this thing. - There is no better test of adaptability than working with other artists on multiple tattoos at the same time. {\an8}- What? {\an8}- At the same time? {\an8}- I don't even know what that means. {\an8}- For each artist still remaining on your team, you will get one canvas. Every hour, you must switch tattoos within your team... - Oh, my God. - Seamlessly picking up {\an1}where your teammate left off. {\an3}- Are you [bleep] kidding me? {\an1}- I feel a headache coming. - Just like musical chairs. Everybody designs a tattoo, everybody starts that tattoo, and then every hour, round robin. {\an1}- We'll be doing four tattoos. - Yeah. - You've got to be kidding me. {\an8}- [bleep] I have four [bleep] people on my team. {\an7} That means I not only have to  tattoo four different tattoos, but four different people,  four different skin types, and then I have to come in  and try to do what the last guy did, and then I don't even know what else is gonna happen, because it's probably gonna happen, {\an1}because it's adaptability day, and they're really trying to [bleep] with us. - But that's not all. - It never is. - Part of being adaptable is being versatile. - Here it comes. - So, today, every tattoo your team does must be in a completely different style. - Oh, my God. - What? - What the [bleep]? - I would rather eat glass. - Subject matters {\an1}should be completely different. Style should be completely different. Yet, it should look like one person did them all. - It's gonna be a good day, boys. - Wow. - You will win or lose as a team. {\an1}If even one artist falls short, your entire team will be at risk. {\an1}- This is gonna be a crazy day. - Your human canvases have been randomly assigned, and you'll have six hours to tattoo. Get started designing, and we'll send in your canvases. Good luck. - All right. - All right, guys. - Let's go. {\an8} - The big thing about this  adaptability challenge {\an8}is it is a team challenge. {\an8} The whole team  has to adapt together. - So we all have pretty different styles, but I think we're gonna have to {\an3}go outside of the box a little bit. - A team game plan  and team communication that everybody knows what's going on with all of the tattoos is very important. - I think neo, neo traditional on one. - Neo. And I was thinking about maybe the skull morph. {\an1}- If we're gonna do 'em, they gotta be perfect. - This is the one time that we actually have an advantage on a challenge because we only have to adapt to two different styles, and that's it. {\an1}- Perfect. We're gonna kill this shit. - The West has four different artists, and they're mainly  black and gray artists. {\an8}So now they have to come up with four different styles, {\an8}and they have to be distinctly different. {\an3}- Hey, what about American traditional? - Yeah, that's great. - Yeah, that's perfect. - Okay, we have one. {\an1}- Are you guys down for lettering? - I mean, I'm down for lettering. {\an1}- Raul, do you want to draft up something, like black and gray realism? - Black and gray realism, for sure. - Are we all good with that? - Yeah. - I did have one other drawing. A crazy [bleep] spider. - Dude, you don't have anything simpler than that? - It's not that complex. - It's super complex. {\an8}- At this point in the competition, {\an8}just doing the ask is not enough. {\an8} You have to go above  and beyond {\an8} and show that you  are a real threat. - Is there any way I could talk you out of doing {\an3}those polka dots on the side? - That's gonna make it look real plain. {\an1}- Let's see what you got, Jimmy. {\an3}- I got this. {\an1}- It's a [bleep] sick piece. - You've already got some renderings right here. - That also would be really [bleep] fun in color. - What is our third style gonna be? - We got like kind of a black and gray face thing. That would be the furthest from any of our styles. - Everything that we can make different is gonna help us. {\an1}- I mean, I can even get a [bleep] skull {\an1}with a [bleep] wing morphed out of it type thing. - Oh, I could tattoo that. What are you thinkin', Frank? - I don't know--I'm a switch hitter here as far as that goes so I can hit whatever we need to do. - I have an idea for a traditional piece. {\an3}I want to do a goblin Jimmy Snaz. - Really? All right. - [bleep] are you guys thinking about doing? - We're gonna do that. [laughter] - I hope you guys do do that. [laughter] {\an8}I love that the Midwest is paying homage {\an8}to Snaz Daddy on this tattoo. {\an8}I've seen a lot of pinups done in my day, but that's probably the best dressed one I've ever seen. I like it, cool. [laughter] [rock music] ♪ ♪ - Okay, artists, you have six hours to prove adaptability as a team. And your time begins... now. [indistinct chatter] - Today, each artist on the hour will switch, and they have to pick up  where the last guy left off. - You got three people tattooing you today. - Well, we're gonna try and make it an easy one. {\an8}- These artists have to show adaptability {\an8}by not seeing transitions from artist to artist. {\an8} It has to be seamless. That makes this extremely difficult {\an1}for anybody who's a weak link. {\an1}- K, do you think that I need to, {\an1}like, bring this out? {\an1} I've got to move this thing, 'cause he's got such  a muscular thigh, the image is distorting. - Muscle definition there... - Yeah. - It could go here. {\an8}- That's eating into my outline time. {\an8}And now I'm not sure I'm gonna get this outline done {\an8} in the first hour. I am stressed, queen. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - Five hours left. Switch artists. {\an3}- I did not finish the line work. - I didn't think you would. - I got the fat lines in. Just--God damn it. - That's fine. - This challenge is [bleep] insane. {\an1}I'll see you in a couple hours. - We're not the biggest team in the house anymore, {\an1}so we just have to be smarter. {\an1}Jerrel, come on over here next. {\an1}I got the top of the hair to outline, and that's it. - Okay.  - In a tattoo where the idea {\an8}is to be cohesive, like one person did it, {\an8} you got to be able to start  on a part of a tattoo and finish that part before the next person comes in. {\an1} So that's what we're doing. - Wait, I thought you were gonna black out the tips. {\an1}- Like, we can easily add that. - I think we should. Even this edge light, you know what I mean, shade it up to the edge. - Uh, Angel... - What are we doing with the background? - Well, that's what-- - Angel. - We are scrambling like crazy right now. It's like everyone's speaking, and nothing makes any sense. Just these last two petals. I just ran-- - So it's already set up? - Yeah. {\an8}- To make someone else's image come to life {\an8} without fully  communicating with them, {\an8}that's where the stress comes in. Hiram, are you going here? - I'm going with, uh, Bob. - So I guess this is how it's gonna be today. [intense music] ♪ ♪ - Four hours left, guys. Switch artists. - How was it over there? - Good. Finished the line work and started working on on the black. - Yeah. You got a shirt and hat. Nice. - So what made you wanna do this? {\an1}- Made me want to what, tattoo? {\an1}I've just always really liked challenges. I didn't really know shit about tattooing, but once I got into it, I realized how challenging it was, and that's what made it fun for me. In the household I grew up in, we were pretty poor. We'd run out of food,  and I was the oldest, I just felt like I needed to do something about it. So I started stealing,  out of necessity, {\an1} all the way up until I was 16 {\an8}when I decided maybe I should stop. {\an8}I fought really hard to be who I wanted to be. So no matter what,  I can't give up. {\an1}I have to keep pushing forward. ♪ ♪ - Three hours remaining. Switch. - Give me a little game plan with your spider. {\an1}- Work on the tongue first. This is the purple {\an1}that you're gonna use right here. - Yeah. - But mix it with white. {\an1}Make sure the purple is lighter than the blue. {\an1}All these areas are dark red. {\an1}Mix black with this red, kind of like blend it in {\an1}with like this lighter red. - Oh, my God. This spider drawing is cool, but it is bonkers. {\an1}- And then all these tiny little... {\an1}chh, chh, chh, chh, chh, chh. {\an8}- You can't micromanage every detail of a tattoo {\an8} when you're sitting  across the room. {\an8}You got to let go, buddy. {\an8} ♪ ♪ - Two hours remaining. Switch. [energetic music] ♪ ♪ - I'm like, real happy and proud about my team. I feel like we actually got an advantage at this point, because we got used to working a small team, and we realized, like, real fast that we were gonna have to depend on each other where I feel like some of the other teams, like-- - Had players that were kind of like trying to take the lead. - Yeah. - This is your final hour. Switch. - If you want to talk to me about anything you have in mind... {\an1}- He went into a highlight that I left skin on purpose. {\an1}The front arm was a lot more visible. - That was my bad. I thought you wanted that. My team thinks nothing of me. {\an1}- Back here, this guy, there was a skin highlight there. - Jordan never made me feel like that. {\an1}- Yeah, so we gotta go back in this little area there. {\an8} - I'm pissed--Jordan  shouldn't have gone home, {\an8}and because of that, {\an8}I just have this new fire underneath me. Everybody can get out of here--everyone. My team, alliances,  like, I don't care. There's a whole new Jerrel coming your way, and it's gonna shock  everybody because I'm not playing any games. - Five, four, three, two, one. That's it, machines down. Time is up. No more ink. - Hell, yeah. - Yeah. - Crispy clean. - What? Da-um! - No one would dare do lettering, you know? - Apparently not. - We just overcame that, you know? - Yeah. - This challenge. - This tattoo is symbolic of our journey. Boom, boom, boom. - Killed it. {\an1}- Do you think lettering is like a six-hour tattoo? - Lettering is nice, but is it not a cop-out? That gonna hold up? - No. - If it does, I'll be [bleep] incensed. - Shit ain't solid. - Right, I know, I see-- - Shit ain't solid--I looked at it close in person. Maybe it's not supposed to be solid, so maybe they do win. - This is about to get spicy. - This war is just getting started. {\an1}- That makes me nervous. [intense music] - Team's getting smaller. With less people, I'm starting to get a better feel on what we're all doing individually. I feel like Jerrel, if given too much freedom, he makes the decisions that are probably gonna cost us eventually. {\an1}- Dicey moves here can sway really far {\an1}in one direction or the other. - I'm not worried about his ability as a tattooer. - He is solid. - Not at all. - But there are little things we have to fine-tune if we want to be as strong as we can be to compete. {\an1}- In the moment, we all have decisions {\an1}that we have to make, {\an1}but if those decisions lead to more questions, that can be a problem. - We have to be {\an3}on the same page. The further we get into this competition, {\an3}the smaller the room is for error. {\an8} [rock music] {\an8} ♪ ♪ - Today you had to prove your adaptability, tattooing multiple tattoos in multiple styles as a team. Let's see how you did. Midwest, let's start with you. What three styles are we looking at? - We got traditional,  we've got like an illustrative and then black and gray.  - Let's have a look {\an1} at the black and gray tattoo. {\an8} - Tattoo's very legible,  it's very big, it's very bold. {\an8} Lotta nice gradation between  the black and the skin. {\an8} It's a weird thing that  the skull was able to maintain {\an8}all of its bottom teeth but yet lose all of its top teeth. {\an8} - I'm gonna call that  bad hygiene. {\an8}- What is going on on the right side {\an8} that's not on the left side? - This filigree. {\an7}- It doesn't match the wing, so you guys miss it on that. {\an8}- Let's take a look at the illustrative tattoo. {\an8}- It's a funny drawing. It has a cool dynamic to it. {\an8} - This light green color  and fade from black {\an8} is very smooth  and very saturated throughout. Overall, I like it. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Let's have a look at the traditional tattoo. - It's very legible,  it's very clean. One line weight,  black shading, color, open skin, anywhere  you look at your fades, you have nice  whip shading throughout. {\an1}The Jimmy Snaz goblin is cool. - Overall, how did the Midwest do as a team? - Each individual tattoo looks like one artist did them, but I just am not in love  with the designs. - I see shortcomings  in each one, but I also see shining points  in each one. I think overall, it's a pretty good team play. - Thank you. - All right. - West, you're next. What styles did you choose? - We did lettering,  black and gray realism, American traditional,  and an illustrative piece. - Let's have a look at the illustrative tattoo. - I love the design. I don't like the tattooing. There's a lot of color play  here that is just strange, {\an1} and because there's no real  heavy black, it looks dull. {\an1} It looks like an old tattoo. You guys missed  a great opportunity with a great drawing. - Let's have a look at the traditional tattoo. - I love the outline  in this tattoo, and I love the green  and the red in this tattoo. {\an1} But a different color of brown and a little bit more whip  on that shading would've made a big difference in this face. - The shading in the neck makes me feel like she went to a tanning booth  and covered her face. {\an1} That part I'm not a fan of. - Let's have a look at the black and gray tattoo. - The wing that goes up  looks just like gray mush. Nothing about this tattoo  is terribly applied, but it's,  as far as the whole piece, {\an1} it just doesn't go together. Teamwork on this tattoo seemed like it was nonexistent. - And the lettering tattoo. - It is not the most  legible lettering. - The overcome  becomes overcrowded. The V is just crouched in. Also, your opening letter  has to be your fancy letter. It can't look like  the rest of the writing. You've got to get a lot more creative. - Let's talk about the West overall as a team. - There's a lot of lack  of adaptability in all of the tattoos. - Just looks like multiple  people had their way with whatever they wanted to do here. - Well, that was rough. - East, you're next. - All right. - What styles did you guys choose? - Color illustrative,  American traditional, {\an1} and black and gray surrealism. - Let's have a look at the black and gray  surrealistic tattoo. {\an1} - This tattoo is really stark, really graphic,  very legible piece. Very simple design, but it also is very strong. The black is rich, super saturated. I love the shading  that you get in the face, {\an8} kind of the stone texture  like a broken statue. {\an8}The application on this tattoo is really nice. {\an1}You really hit it in this one. - Let's have a look at the illustrative tattoo. - It does get a little bit  lost in what's happening here. {\an8} There's a lot of color  matching {\an7} with the tan and the pinks. {\an8} It makes it a little bit  less legible of a design. - None of the black in this tattoo from outline to shading  to solid to anywhere, looks like the team that just did the last tattoo, so major inconsistencies in that. - Let's take a look at the traditional tattoo. - Where the black is  whip shaded, it's nice. The areas where it's colored  in solid it's not as rich. - It definitely looks like several hands at work here. This red is so nicely punched in, then I move down to this row  of wings that are black, {\an8} and it's just not.  - There's a couple of {\an8} missed opportunities here  to really punch it in {\an7}and make it super definitive. - Guys, how do you feel the East did overall as a team? - The best tattoo overall would be the black and gray, because it looks  like one person did it. Who sunk the black  in the rose? - Who did the traditional? - I did a lot of the traditional black. - You're not the same with yourself. - I think there's something about working on somebody else's design that is a lot more nerve-wracking. - It's adaptability. You got to color 'em the way you color 'em. - South, you're up next. Let's look at  the neo traditional tattoo. - Very cool illustration. You got a lot  of nice line work, but the skin tone is  where you really fall short. {\an8}The color of skin tone in that forehead {\an8} is different than the color  of skin tone in the nose {\an8} which is different than  the color of skin tone {\an8}that's in the cheek. - In the cheek, there's like {\an8} four different colors  that I can count in there. {\an8} It creates mud. No more of that. - What was the other style you guys did? - Kind of like a modern trash polka. - The whole thing is bad-ass.  I like the design a lot. - But the challenge of you  trying to make each other tattoo the same, you kind of camouflage that whole part of the challenge, because everything goes every which way but loose in this tattoo. - I disagree. - One inch apart is totally  different tattooed style. - To be able to pull them  together is still adaptability. Does that tattoo look good? - Is the tattoo overall aesthetically pleasing? Yes. Did you show me a technical thing that both  of you can really hone in and be versatile  and be adaptable to? I don't know. - As a canvas, looking at these two, {\an8} they both look really  attractive. {\an8} - I still think,  if we're judging adaptability, {\an8}they just did basically abstractness. - Well, I'm pretty sure that Jordi had to adapt to Jason on this in a big way, so that screams adaptability to me. - Thank you, guys. - All right, judges. It's time to determine which team had the best tattoos of the day. - I don't have a best of the day. [dramatic music] - Oh, my God. - I don't see it. No one team busted out. To be fair to every one of you, why am I gonna pick a winner if I don't see one? - But if you pick one team that was overall most consistent and most adaptable to each other--the Midwest. {\an8} All three of these tattoos  do look like {\an8} they could've been  done by one person. {\an8}I don't see that much adaptability {\an8}in the other teams. {\an8}- You don't see adaptability in the South? {\an8} - No.  - They look like {\an8} one person did them.  - I do not agree with that. {\an8} - I agree.  I think so too. - Shit ain't solid. - Right, I see-- - Shit ain't solid. I looked at it close in person. Maybe it's not supposed to be solid, so maybe they do win. - You gonna let me talk here? - Yeah. - [mouthing] Damn! - My problem with voting for the Midwest is that winged skull. {\an8} - I don't like the design  of the teeth {\an8} and a couple other  little things, {\an8} but as far as  how it's tattooed, you wouldn't guess that three people took their time working on that. Do I think that these three are the best three tattoos we're ever gonna see? No. But for this challenge, most adaptable to each other, my vote is for the Midwest. - Thank you. - I love the South, but I'm going with the Midwest. - Whew! The judges have decided the best tattoos of the day goes to the Midwest. - Good job, guys. - All right. - Yes. Whoo! - Congratulations. - Congratulations, Midwest. You are all safe from elimination. - [bleep] - Please take a seat. - Now we don't know what the [bleep]'s gonna happen. - West, South, and East. That means someone from your team will be going home. - [bleep]. - Your team may have lost the battle today, but this war is just getting started. - All right. What's it gonna be? - To make it to the end, you must eliminate the weak to keep the strongest team standing. {\an1}- That makes me nervous. - Today, the power is in your hands. - What does that mean? - I don't know. - We'll have to find out. - Each of you as a team must discuss and decide which artist on your team was the weakest. - Oh, [bleep] - No. - The artist that each team nominates {\an1}will be put up for elimination. {\an3}- This is a sick, twisted game. - Who was the weakest link? {\an1}You should be smart about it. You should be fair about it. {\an1}Your decision's going to send one of your fellow teammates home. - The strongest team is gonna help the most people make it closer to the end. Do what you gotta do. - [whispering] This is about to get spicy. {\an3}- This is gonna get [bleep] weird. - Head back to the loft. You have a tough decision to make. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - All right, before we say who we're putting up for elimination, does anybody, you know, want to? - I will, and I'll fight, and I'll try to win, {\an3}but truthfully, like, I don't want to. {\an1}- I feel like it's an obvious choice. {\an1}The only thing I've been considered for is the bottom. {\an1}Clearly, in the grand scheme of things, I'm the weakest link. - I don't want to throw you down there if you don't believe more than an 80% chance that you're not gonna end up on top. - I don't know that I have the best chance. I think I definitely have a fighting chance. - What if I went down there? Because I'm strong, I can do a bunch of different stuff. {\an1}- There's no reason for you to. - I'm just saying, like, there's different options. {\an1}If we pick the weakest link, and the other people pick their strongest link, it's just gonna ultimately lead to one of us going home. If we pick a strong link, and they pick their weak links, {\an1}one of them are gonna go home. {\an1}- I just think it's a no-brainer that I have to go down. - But if it's black and gray, I feel I can hold my own. {\an1}- Your black and gray is better than mine, {\an1}but I'm more versatile than you are. - Yeah, but I mean I wouldn't be afraid to go down either. {\an1}- As a returning veteran, it's just my responsibility. {\an1}It's one of those things that, {\an1}regardless whether you make it to the end {\an1}of this competition or not, {\an1}it's what kind of person you are in this competition. {\an1}I got a three-year-old at home. - Yeah. - And what kind of example {\an1}would I set if I say, hey, it's okay {\an1}to let somebody else take the fall {\an1}when you were supposed to be the leader? {\an1}The right thing to do is to let me handle this. - I want to make the best decision that we can to ensure that we stay together. Put me down. - No, no, no [bleep] way. Like how are we literally gonna stand our team and say that you're the weakest link and put you down there? - Coming back to compete for me is cleaning up the mess I made in my life, facing my [bleep] problems. For me, getting to the finale is everything. That's my one shot. But I can't do that if I'm hiding behind my team members. {\an1}- You're the strongest artist on the team. {\an1}Is it fair that you now have to go down into this competition as the weakest artist? - Just vote me down. I got you guys. - We don't know what the [bleep] we're getting ourselves into, So whoever goes down there needs to be ready for anything. [intense music] ♪ ♪ {\an1}- Today, your team's tattoos were lacking in adaptability. {\an1}It's now up to you to decide which artist on your team was the weakest. South, let's start with you. Which artist are you putting up for elimination? - Both were my designs today, so I'm going. - I have a lot of respect for Jason, and I feel confident that he can pull through. {\an8}- Fair enough. {\an1}- Jason, please step forward. {\an8}- Right. - West, which artist are you putting up for elimination? - As a team, we don't necessarily believe that we have a weak link. - I appreciate these guys, but my vote is for myself. {\an1}- Why did you vote yourself? - Angel's won tattoo of the day twice. These guys have both been considered multiple times. {\an1}I've been in the bottom twice. I don't think it would be fair for them to risk themselves to save me. - I understand. Raul, please step forward. Finally, East. Which artist are you putting up for elimination? {\an3}- We need to make a decision. {\an8}- It's not a decision that I agree with, {\an8}but, uh... {\an1}- Jimmy. - It's getting sticky. - I'm voting myself down too, Dave. - All right, Jimmy. Please step forward. All right, Raul, Jason, and Jimmy. {\an1}It's survival of the fittest, and one of you will be going home. Tomorrow, the three of you must face off in a six-hour tattoo proving your adaptability. - Here's the catch. - [bleep] - Today, the power is in the hands of the winners. Midwest, because your team proved your adaptability {\an1}and is safe from elimination, you now have the power to assign the style and subject of the face-off tattoo. - Didn't see that coming. - I think it's safe to say that the way this day has played out, nobody saw it coming. - Yeah. - Take a minute and discuss as a team. - Okay. - All right? - What style and subject have you picked for the face-off? - I'm going to give my man the best chance he has of staying in the house. So, we're going with American traditional tiger heads. - American traditional tiger heads. {\an8}- Yes. - I feel like everyone on the line can do traditional, so if you guys come out on top and Jimmy goes home, I'd rather him go home on something [bleep] dope. And if he wins, he's here. {\an1}- Let the games begin. {\an1}- If I want to win this thing, I've got to beat Jimmy eventually anyway, so might as well start at it now. - [kiss] - Everybody should know exactly what they're going in for. Do your best tattoo, man. - Make it the hardest decision we've made. - The face-off is set. In this turf war, there's no room for error. Show any signs of weakness, and you will be going home. Head back to the loft. Get ready for tomorrow. ♪ ♪ - It's a tough one, man. I don't think you should've been in this fight. - This is definitely a curve ball. - Oh, shit. - No [bleep] way, man. - I mean, I still look at these things, and I'm just like, this is wrong, this is wrong, but I've just got to understand that it's the style. - Yeah. - American traditional tiger heads? This is my comfort zone, {\an1} and nobody today is gonna draw  one the way that I'm going to, and that's a fact. - Yours just is crazy. But looking at that one, I'd be like, man, that looks like Jimmy Snaz drew that sucker. {\an1}- Well, that's the point. Everyone thinks this is all I can do. But now, it's all that I can do. {\an8}So I need to make sure that I can do it [bleep] perfect. {\an8}Looks good. - Thanks, man. I don't know how like straight up American traditional it is, {\an1}because that's just not how I think. {\an1}I'm just gonna try to keep it as simple as possible. - You're right there, dude. And now there's a shit-ton of pressure on me to make sure that I don't  just outdo these guys but that I have to [bleep] smoke 'em. {\an1}Ready to send this mother[bleep] home? {\an1}- It's gonna be a fun, fun day. - All right, artists. This is your last chance to save yourself from elimination. {\an1}You have six hours to tattoo an American traditional tiger head. And your time starts... now. - Let's have some fun, man. - Yeah, let's do it. {\an8} - This is a face-off  between three people {\an8}doing the same subject and same style. {\an8}- You can take the day off now if you want to. Jimmy's gonna kill it. - That doesn't mean I won't kill it--Jimmy's gonna get beat eventually, right? - Keep it simple--the more you add to this challenge, the more you're gonna be  judged on. - Raul, what are these lines in the tongue? - Between the teeth. - I don't think it makes sense. - I would take out both of these ripples {\an1}and then just solid fill red. Make it as simple as you can. - Cool. - Bold, simple, clean tiger head--safe. {\an1}This is Snaz day. You're a bad bitch, and you know it. - Tell me I'm a bad bitch. {\an3}You're a bad bitch, Jimmy. - ♪ Party time ♪ - Let's do it. - Now or never. - Ready as you're gonna get, huh? - Yep. ♪ ♪ - That thing looks solid. - This is an intimidating fight. - If they're testing adaptability, you're the one, buddy. You're really adapting here. - Adapting? I'm a black and gray  realism tattooer. I am not super proficient in American traditional. - Keep doing exactly what you're doing. {\an1}- I'm just cleaning up every little [bleep] nook and cranny. {\an8}Not only do I have to battle two veterans {\an8}in this competition, {\an8} but now I've got to do a style  against one of the veterans who specializes  in American traditional. It could take a miracle for me to pull this one off. [exciting music] - Five hours, guys. Five more hours. [tattoo machine buzzing] {\an1}- Are you getting a little cold? - I'm fine. - You're fine? Okay. - Yeah, Jimmy's leaning on me. I got his body heat, so it's nice. - There you go. {\an1}- That's the Jimmy Snaz experience, man, really. {\an1}The tattoo is just like a souvenir. {\an8}Me and K are the cups in the support bra {\an8} that is team East  for Jimmy today. - Could you do me a favor? Could you put this piece of hair, like, behind my ear, or [bleep] do something with it because it's getting [indistinct]. - Jimmy's the heart and soul of our team, man. So, yeah, absolutely. I'll tuck your hair in. - Thanks. - You're a bad bitch. I'm here for you. Back in my day I had a friend named Jimmy Snaz. That was a crazy mother[bleep]. - Right? {\an7}- This is the second time now {\an8}that the Midwest has catered a challenge towards Jimmy. {\an8} I don't think I can out-tattoo  Jimmy in his own style. But luckily, I just have to  out-tattoo Raul. {\an1}So you think Raul's gonna win? {\an1}Who's gonna go home, me or Jimmy? - I don't know. We'll see how you do. You always trip at the end. - I trip at the end? - Yeah. - I do not trip at the end. - Jason does not know how to whip shade. - No. - Not at all. {\an1}- Not at all. - I didn't think about it before. - Oh, I did. There's things that are not where you would think they would be with how technically sound he is. - Two more hours, guys. Two more hours. - I have three sons. My twins, they just all had their birthday party, and while I was here, but my wife's a neat freak, so, like, oh, I don't envy you that mess. - Ah, no.  - Being away from my boys is like one of the hardest  things I've ever done. No matter how hard  something might seem, I've got to lead by example. I've got to show them when you start something, you finish it. - What do you think about the-- about that green in the eye? - If it was my call, I would probably do a yellow. - I think on those parts of the cheek where you left them completely skin, you should whip there and whip there. - Yes, I do think that. {\an1}- You're not going to know how far you can go unless you try. [intense music] ♪ ♪ - Five, four, three, two, one. That is it. Machines down. Time is up. No more ink. {\an1}- Yeah, that thing looks great. {\an1}- It's a pretty sexy tattoo. - This thing is solid. - I'm so stoked about it. {\an1}- It's mean and it's tough. - Looks awesome, man. - It's not too bad {\an1}bad for a black and gray guy. - I think it's a close [bleep] round. - Yeah. I feel like there are enough areas in a couple people's things that might make this a closer round than we thought it was gonna be. {\an1}- If Jimmy or Jason goes home, it changes everything. - Yeah. - You got handed a golden ticket, basically. - I'm not gonna say I didn't. That's definitely my style. But I still had to step up my game. - I mean, here's the thing, though, is that traditional is only gonna carry you so far in this competition. I'm capable of doing much more past traditional. {\an1}- Now, here's the deal. As good as you [bleep] are, {\an1}when I saw that thing up close, {\an1}I saw shit that didn't look like you did it. - Here's the thing is that you guys aren't judges. You guys are just [bleep] competitors. And you're not even that good a competitor. So if you want to sit there and run your mouth about some flaws that you saw in a tattoo... {\an1}- I literally thought you were gonna show up and kick ass. - I felt like I did kick ass. - Jason, we assumed that you would be safe. And now we don't know that you're safe. - Today, you faced off in a battle for survival. You were being tested on adaptability. Raul, Jason, and Jimmy, based on your work, one of you will be packing your machines. Raul, we'll start with you. - Real simple, real bold. You hit the mark on  traditional style look. You have a strong,  simple color palette, nice saturated black, and then you have areas of  black whip shade in the nose, {\an1} black whip shade in the lip. That's the kind of whip shade  that we're looking for. - Wow. {\an1}- But the third eye is strange. Your drawing  has this really wide gap, and then your circles  on those eyes, you kind of lose it,  especially on the left one. And I do wish that  the brown of the tiger wasn't in his teeth.  That's very bizarre. - I'm not so familiar with all of the rules. That was just an aesthetic decision I made. - I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but this is the most legible thing you've shown us. - Yeah, I figured that was coming. {\an1}But any compliments from you, guys, I'll take that all day. Next up is Jimmy. - What I love about this tattoo is the black. It reads very graphic  and it really stands out on this person's skin. I like how stark  and how open it is, how much open skin  you rely on to really capture  the look of this thing. - It was stressful trying not to overthink it and also knowing that these guys are gonna bust their asses to compete with what I do. - I love the confidence in this tattoo. You see that whip shade,  it's right off the red lip, and the one that's right  off the chin, that's the look. It's just solid black, and then, whoosh, {\an1} very consistent, very strong. very rich. I mean, it looks so perfect. - Thank you. - Next up is Jason. - I like the illustration. It really has  that vintage look to it, but I wish you would've whipped out  your color to the edge. That brown,  I wish that was just kind of fanned out a little bit. - There's nowhere where you fade from brown to skin. It's just filled in,  and it just looks patchy, and then there's very little whip shading at all in the tattoo. - I'm just a little confused about those lines, that shading style.  What is that? - Well, like I whipped it out,  and it kind of, like, accentuated the whips  a little bit. It's a stylized thing. I like that it didn't look like {\an1}all the same thing, you know? - That, for me, is a little  bit of a question mark, especially because we're looking at American traditional and I would think that would be something that would be important. Okay, judges, it is time to determine who is going home. {\an8}- It's a tough one, man. Three good tattoos. {\an8} Going by the textbook,  instantly, {\an8}Jimmy's out of the running to go home. {\an8} Jimmy's is the most  well-applied. - So Jimmy's safe. - Sweet. - Yes! - So it comes down between Raul and Jason. - Jason, the brown is really where you lose me. It's a weird way  to not have a whip or a fade or just a standard traditional look. My vote's for Jason. - But I have to say, design-wise, Jason does  a better illustration. When I go to Raul's, that eye, man, {\an1} I can't get past that thing. My vote's for Raul. - The three eyes for me are strange. {\an1}I like Jason's drawing better, but whip shading is the foundation of traditional. {\an8} Raul, given just with that bit  of whip in the nose, {\an8}is why you're here. Today it's gonna be Jason. - Holy shit. - The judges have decided. Jason, you do not have what it takes to be Ink Master. - I don't think you should've been in this fight. - I mean, if I have to be on a team, I'm not gonna let a teammate take the fall. So regardless the outcome, I still would've put myself down here. - You've done really strong tattoos in this competition. This is definitely a curve ball. - Well, thanks, man, I appreciate it. - Please pack your machines and close shop. - [bleep] - I don't feel like that I did a bad tattoo today. My biggest downfall is myself.  I like doing weird, abstract,  out-of-the-box stuff. But probably better to fly under the radar. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - Jason. - Hey, what's up, man? - Let's have a talk. - Yeah. {\an1}- I know you struggle with shit, {\an1}I know you struggle with the rules {\an1}where you're kind of putting your own shit and everything, {\an1}which is cool, but if you want to be back in this game {\an1}and you want to do things to get to the finale, {\an1}I would pardon you right now. - Really? - If you want that. - Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I--dude, I want to ride to the end. Absolutely, man. - I understand, bro. - [indistinct, bleep]. - Unpack. As of now, you are officially pardoned. - Hey, thanks, man. - Don't let me down, brother. - I'm not. Whoo! Oh, those guys are about to really hate me now. [intense music] ♪ ♪ narrator: On the next episode  of "Ink Master"... - Whoo! Y'all didn't think I was gone, did you? - Now it's me versus  everybody. They try to take  my teammate out? I have to make sure I cut everyone's throat. - I need  to kick it up a notch. - Yeah, for sure. This team crap? Like, no. {\an1}- Your enemies are my enemies. - I think we should shake things up. - It's a balance of power. - Where's the bam? Where's the zing, zing? - I have no idea what I'm looking at. - It's flat. It's boring. You've got to push the envelope. - Misery loves company.
