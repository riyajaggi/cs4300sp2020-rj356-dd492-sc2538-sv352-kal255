  male announcer: On the last  episode of "Ink Master"... - That was the end of Team South. Now it's just Team Solo. - You're kind of untethered. - I'm on my own now. announcer:  In the flash challenge, tempers flared as cracks  in the alliance emerged. - Let's be mathematical about this shit and take our [bleep] time. - I can't imagine  that this is the way that the Midwest usually works with each other. - I feel everybody thinks I'm, like, [bleep] stupid.

 - This is insane. - There's an inner struggle between the team. - What they've set up is destined to self-destruct. announcer:  In the elimination tattoo, the alliance's advantage  backfired. - K is screwed. - These lines are my weakest lines. - At the end of the day, what I'm not gonna do is protect K anymore. announcer: In the elimination, Jason, Jessa, and K {\an1}were the bottom three artists. - Maybe I stumbled today... - But you-- - But I also know {\an8}mine's probably the better of the three.

 {\an7} There's just some really crazy {\an8} anatomical issues  on the other two, and then one of them's just really overworked. - The roughest application is in K's tattoo. - K, you do not have what it takes to be Ink Master. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ announcer:  Ten artists remain, but only one will earn  a $100,000 prize {\an1} and the title of Ink Master. [rock music] {\an8} ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - Right now, there's five on each side. If we add us and we add the "Midweast"... {\an1}- We gotta, like, band together to stop the reign of the "Midweast." They've kind of been dominating this whole last couple weeks. {\an1}- The Midwest is pissing me off 'cause they're playing this nice guy thing, but I'm like, you're being shady as [bleep]. You teamed up with East 'cause you know they're weaker than you, and you can throw them out whenever you need to. - With this alliance that we have in here, it's because we're being forced. We have to align. - The comments we're at right now-- "Midweast," for sure. I mean, they--they've won too much shit in a row. - All of the weaknesses that we've seen, it's time for us to start picking on them. {\an1}I think it's time to retaliate. - Saying you guys wanna follow my voice for a little bit? In people's ears, just bullying the [bleep] out of 'em. - Of course, yeah. - If we can keep, you know, these five people here longer than we can keep the ones over there, I mean, we all have a better shot of making it to the end. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ - Welcome. You've been fighting alongside your regions to take out the competition, {\an3}but this turf war is far from over. - To make it to the end and earn $100,000, a feature in "Inked" magazine, and the title of Ink Master, you must prove you are a strong artist even when no one is at your side. - That doesn't sound good. - This week, there are no teams. - What? - [chuckles] - It's every artist for themselves. - Oh, my God. - Damn. - Whoa. {\an8}Finally, I can act as an individual {\an8}and just worry about me for once. - And not only that, we are heading straight into the elimination tattoo. - Brutal. - This week, we are testing technical application. - Back to the basics. - Yeah. - It's just another day for us. We can do this. - If you don't have good  technical application, {\an8}then you'll be doing sloppy tattoos. {\an8}Plain and simple. You can't make a clean line,  you can't do full saturation, your shit's gonna look bad. - Today, you must prove your strength by facing off against another artist in a head-to-head style battle regardless of region. {\an1}- Damn. - I don't want to face off against you guys. - There are ten artists remaining, and there will be five different head-to-head face-offs, each in a completely different style... - Okay. - Fine line black and gray... - Looking at you guys. - American traditional. - And Jimmy will be doing traditional. - Japanese... biomech... - What? I'm the [bleep] biomech guy.  I specialize in that shit. I don't think  anybody in this room {\an7}can compete with me in biomech. - And tribal. - Damn. Tribals? Really? - No. - Win your style battle, and you will continue to fight another week. Lose, and you will be up for elimination. - That's half the room. {\an1}- Five people on the bottom? - That's intense, man. {\an1}- When it comes down to just {\an1}one tattoo versus one tattoo, it's win or lose. It's gonna be tough. {\an3}- There's no easy way out of this. - And this week, two of you will be going home. - [bleep] kidding me? - Holy shit. {\an1}Two people are gonna go home. {\an8}That means my team could be wiped out completely. {\an1}- Just gets better and better. - [groans] - One by one, the artist from the team with the fewest remaining competitors will pick which style they want to tattoo first, and so on and so forth, until every battle has been filled. - No. - Choose wisely. You may not know who you're going up against until it's too late. - We're [bleep]. - Sorry if I have to battle one of you for biomech. - South, because you have the fewest remaining artists in your region, you get to pick your style battle first. Jason, which style do you choose? - Tribal. - Tribal it is. {\an1}Jason, please step over here. - First few years I tattooed, I did do a lot of tribal, so I feel like to increase my chances of winning a face-off, {\an8}tribal's probably the best way to go. - East, you're next. {\an3}Jimmy, which style do you choose? {\an1}- This is my chance to take someone out from the West. {\an1}American traditional. - No way. - How does he keep getting away with it? I don't know why  he continues to do this. {\an8}If I were Jimmy, {\an8}it would be worth it for me to pick something else {\an8}just for the sake of shutting the rest of us up. - Jessa. - Win or lose, I think it'd be fun to go up against Jason, {\an1}so I'm gonna go with tribal. - Damn.  - I'm about to hopefully knock this mother[bleep]  out of here. {\an8}How cool would that be? - All right, Midwest, you're up next. Jerrel, which style do you choose? - Biomech. - Biomech it is. - He just called you out. - Bob is so into his ego  with his biomech stuff, {\an8}and I want to show Bob that I'm ready to play. - All right, Kelly, what's it gonna be? - Japanese. - Japanese. - That's real scary right there. - Japanese has a lot of rules. - Frank. - Fine line black and gray. {\an8}- Wow. {\an8}- I don't want to go against my own team for any reason. - He knows right now it's gonna be hard. If I get a chance to take out  somebody from the West, I'm doing it. {\an3}- And finally, West. Bob? - Well, pretty obvious that I'm gonna pick biomech. - Do it, man. {\an1} - You signed a death sentence. - Oh, shit. {\an1}- I want a competition. I don't want a cop-out. - Angel. - I'm gonna do fine line black and gray. {\an1} I didn't come here to prove that I'm a good  black-and-gray artist, {\an8}but I did come here to kick Frank's ass. - Raul. Which style do you choose? - Well, I've done the Jimmy face-off. I think I'll mix it up today and go Japanese. I'm definitely  taking a risk today, because for  technical application, Kelly is definitely one  of the strongest competitors. {\an7}But I don't think he realizes {\an8}how much Japanese I've actually done. - That means, Hiram, you'll face off against Jimmy tattooing American traditional. - Nobody wants to face Jimmy  in American traditional. That's the only thing that that mother[bleep] does. {\an8}And this gonna be my first traditional tattoo ever. I'm [bleep]. {\an1}- The style battles are set. {\an1}You'll have six hours to tattoo. Your canvases are open and have been randomly assigned, but there is one more thing that you should know. {\an1}- Oh, shit. {\an1}- There's always one more thing. - Your tattoos must speak for themselves, because today, all of your tattoos will be judged blind. {\an1}- [gasps] - This is gonna be a fun one. {\an8}- True battle. - Fail to win your head-to-head face-off, and you will be up for elimination. - Good luck. - Good luck. {\an3}- Head to your shops. Good luck. - All right. - Let's do this, bro. - Here's what's  beautiful today. We're doing a face-off, {\an8}meaning two artists are gonna battle in the same style, {\an8}so it's gonna give an even comparison. - All right. - This is  a double elimination, so for us,  it's gonna be a tough day, but for them, it's gonna be tougher. [tense music] {\an1}- This is what I got going on. - Okay. Not mad at it at all. - Let's see it. - Doing a dragon koi. ♪ ♪ You don't do Japanese a lot, do you? - Either way, you're gonna beat Raul. {\an1}- Raul wanted to do Japanese. You guys ever looked at his work? Oh, you didn't? - No. - Uh-oh. - Does he do Japanese? - Ah, it's gonna be a fun day. {\an1} - Jason just wastes his time trying to talk  a bunch of shit. {\an8}Jason should run his machines how he runs his mouth, {\an8}and then maybe do a solid tattoo. - Kelly's dragon koi looks like shit. That thing is really weird. - Wow. {\an1}- What's Frank drawing? - He's doing an illustrative old man face, so it's very illustrative black and gray. - That mother[bleep]. - I gave him the benefit of the doubt for a second. Jason just being rat... - [sighs] - It's happening. - Let me look at Bob's now. ♪ ♪ What--what are you doing? - No, I'm not telling you, dude. It's gonna be a surprise. - Hope you're not surprised, Bob. I'll take you out on your own style, man. - Jerrel looked me  dead in the [bleep] eyes {\an8}when he picked biomech, and I couldn't back down {\an7}from a call-out that blatant. But honestly, I don't do biomech  in a six-hour timeframe. It takes time. - His ego's gonna just--pfff. [laughs] {\an1}Just go right out the window. - It's a lot of [bleep]  pressure on me right now, {\an1} because somebody calls me out on something  that I do every day, I have to [bleep] sell at that shit. - He has to be simplistic as [bleep], because it takes Bob 20-something hours to do bio. {\an1}I can tattoo faster than Bob. I don't need to go as basic. And I'm not going to. [rock music] {\an8} ♪ ♪ - Artists, you have six hours to tattoo. This face-off begins now! [tense music] - This week we're doing head-to-head style battles. - Excited? - Little nervous. - Well, don't worry. It'll look sick. {\an1}- I decided to challenge Bob. - You got this. {\an1}- When it's two people doing the same thing side by side, it makes a more definitive  decision who stays, who goes. {\an8}Head-to-head, same thing. Boom, boom. {\an1}- Here we go. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - You said it was gonna be black and gray? - Yes, sir. The challenge was accepted by Angel. - We're both doing black and gray today, {\an3}and that's kinda her strong suit. - So they're gonna compare yours to hers? - Yes, they are. I'm gonna show her how to do what she does best. {\an8}I'm not well-versed in fine line black and gray. I have to do this tattoo  cleanly and take her out. I know Angel's bringing a really cool tattoo today, {\an1}but I mean, like, this is, like, twice the size and way more, like, fine line. I had some supplies sent from home, and there was a picture  from my daughter. {\an1} It was a stick figure of me. I'm on the stage, and there's a trophy. Knowing that she already  sees me at the finale is just motivation to get there. - What's up, Frank? - Not much. Checking you out. She's focused. Look at that. - I know. Laser focus. - Dig it. - He's the guy I gotta beat. - He's good? - He's good at something. I don't think he does black and gray primarily, so... - Well, I'm glad I'm here and not there. - Yes, right? {\an1}- You have four hours remaining. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ - Mm-hmm. I'm glad we completely took different directions on it. - Yeah. - Still gonna win though, so... - All right, we'll see. - Yeah. {\an1}- [chuckles] {\an1}I do this shit every day. You're the guy that signed his own death sentence. Doesn't have a chance. [chuckles] - Three hours left, everybody. Three hours. ♪ ♪ - [groans] {\an8}- Yeah, it [bleep] does. - So I really just gotta do this bar right here, and then I gotta shade, and that's it. - How long do you think that'd be 'cause my body's numb. [dramatic musical sting] - Are you kidding me right now? Like, really? - My knees are still numb. - Sucks, but... I need you to push yourself as far as you can. - [mumbling] - Been here too long and fought through too much stuff to go home. We have to finish it. - I don't know, dude. {\an1}I don't want to do it to you, but my knees are still numb. {\an3}- Is it from you just laying there? - No. - What is it from? {\an1}- That's f--I don't know, {\an1}'cause, like, I can't hear out of this ear. That's why. - Are you saying you can't do any more? {\an3}- Okay. Really? All this work-- all this work just for nothing. Five people going down. {\an8}That's half of the room, and I have an unfinished tattoo. {\an8}You might as well have just bought me a plane ticket home. She just [bleep] quit. [sighs heavily] She's--she's done. - What? Wait. - Your [bleep] knees hurt? I don't give a [bleep] about that. [bleep]. [door slams] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - She [bleep] tapped on me. - Are you serious? - Yeah. {\an1}Dead [bleep] serious. So now I have a [bleep] unfinished tattoo. We'll see what the [bleep] happens. - That's two hours, people. Two hours to go. - You won. - Why? {\an1}- 'Cause she [bleep] walked out. - Shut the [bleep] up. - I'm being serious. - Are you [bleep] kidding me? - No. - Are you serious? - Yeah! - Hey, man, I might not finish, so... you know, I might be in the same boat. I'm sorry, man. - Yeah, me too. [tattoo machine buzzing] - Jimmy. - What's up, papa? {\an1}- What kind of brown will you use? {\an1}I have, like, four different ones. - Open my drawer. Yep. That's the one I always use. - Can I steal this one? - Yeah, yeah. - Jimmy essentially  giving me advice-- {\an7}I believe he feels bad for me. {\an1} He's just looking at me like, {\an1}"Eh, you're so cute for trying." I'm a shark, and if I smell blood, I'm coming for you. {\an3}- That's the dude I'm going against. - Oh, okay. [both laugh] {\an1}- That's commendable. I see you, fair and square. - Yeah, fair's fair. {\an7}I may be taking a risk here with helping Hiram, but I don't care. No matter what happens,  Hiram's not gonna win. It is my style. There's no way in hell  I'm gonna be in the bottom. ♪ ♪ - It'd be weird if the other dude that you're going against came over here and asked for black. - [chuckles] I don't think anyone knows that I've done tribal before. My mentor always  got requests for tribal, {\an1} and he never wanted to do it, so he threw  every tribal piece my way. {\an8}And bam, here I am on [bleep] "Ink Master" doing tribal. Did I go after one of the biggest fish in the pond today? Yeah. - Go big or go home, right? - I definitely got a chance today. {\an1}I looked at the other girl's. It looked so awkward on that guy's arm. - It does? - Yeah. {\an1}- Ah. - Final hour, guys. One hour remaining. - Raul, you're super [bleep] versatile, dude. - I like doing Japanese. I used to hate it, and like, now I love it. {\an8}I know Kelly's gonna impress everybody {\an8}with his clean line work like he always does, so I've got to take it  a different way. {\an1} Today, I got to outdraw him. I got to at least give him a run for his money. - Weird little funky tattoo. - [laughs] - I think I have  a really good understanding of Raul's weaknesses. {\an8}His line work is not very consistent all the time. And I designed this tattoo  to show off how consistently good my line work is. I know that I'm making a lot of people nervous. Well, we'll see. ♪ ♪ - Five, four, three, two, one. That is it. Time's up. Machines down. No more ink. {\an1}- Thanks for [bleep] sitting like a rock. - That thing's clean. - We're all done. - Awesome. - Ta-da. - Oh, my God, it's awesome. - You got it. - All right. You're all done. - It's [bleep] cool. {\an1}- Yeah, I'm really sad, though, because like, when Jerrel came over, he was like, {\an3}"Yeah, my person just left on me." Like, I almost started crying for him, dude. Even if I win or whatever, I feel like I didn't really compete. ♪ ♪ - I could not help but notice that you came over to the light table and had a nice, little chat with everyone and then reported back to everyone on the West about what was going on. - South and West, we're out to break you guys' cycle. - Who is cheerleading for the West now? - I'm [bleep] proud of you, dude. - Thanks, dude. - You went after Jason. {\an1}I think you might have got him. - I respect that you showed up and you took the fight. Is Jimmy gonna show up to the competition and do something other than what Jimmy does? - It's an American traditional [bleep] challenge. {\an1}Obviously I'm gonna take it. - You've been playing it safe the whole time. We're definitely at the part of the competition {\an1}that you have to swing forward, and I think we want to start seeing you swing. - Throw me a pitch. [heavy rock music] {\an8} ♪ ♪ - Oh, shit. It's judgment day. - Let's go, dude. - There you go. - All right, today, the artists are facing off {\an1}in a head-to-head style battle, and we're judging these things blind. - I know I'm in trouble, but that's obvious. - Let's see how they did. Let's take a look at the tribal face-off. Bring up the first tattoo. - Well, that's me. - I think the design has a cool flow to it. It's bold. I like the shapes and  the details that are in it. I like the imagery of the sun  and the moon. - It's a little basic  for this competition. I would expect next-level tribal. - I agree with Dave. I think it's entry-level tattooing. - Let's take a look at the second tattoo. - That's mine.  - A lot of it's not solid. You can see  the directional shading. If you look at any  of the long, skinny lines, {\an1} they just get thin and thick,  thin and thick, thin and thick instead of being this continuously smooth line. - I think it's safe to say both Jason and I do not do next-level tribal. - Now let's move on to the American traditional style battle. - Oh, boy. - All right, here we go. - This is Jimmy Snaz. Jimmy's black shading,  how he whips out, {\an1} is definitely in this tattoo. - I don't mean  any offense to anybody, but I don't know  if this is Jimmy. The red all the way around  the exterior petals is completely holiday'd. If this is Jimmy,  something's up. - Can be nerve-wracking doing your own style. - Moving on to the second tattoo. - That one's mine. - It is a style battle, and this drawing  is the statement. {\an1} The little, white highlights on the edge  of the green leaves--nice. Edge of the flower  that's white {\an1} with the red fitted out--nice. {\an1} But anywhere in this tattoo, the black is not as dark  as the outline. - Might've gotten me, Hiram. - We'll see. - [bleep]. - And now the Japanese face. - That's mine. - Very stylized take  on a hannya. The red in the chin  is really solid. But then up in  the forehead, the red is just  going in every direction. It's a lot  of messy application. - Damn. - Second tattoo. {\an1}- There's my little monster. - This thing is 100%,  without a doubt, upside down. - That's insane. - It needs to be drawn  going up. You can't just take a fish  and turn it upside down. - [bleep]. - The butterfly wings for fins  are very strange. Technically,  it's applied well, but I just dislike the look of this tattoo, and that's it. - But I didn't match your technical application. - We're arguably looking upside down. It's just a huge technical error. - Oh, man. - All right, fine line black and gray face-off. - That's mine. - Very strange. It's very piecemeal.  There is some smooth shading. I like the deep-set black, but the hair is very,  very messy. There's this fine line kind  of outlining in there, and then everything's  just messy. - Let's take a look at the second fine line black and gray. - I like the drawing.  The woman looks beautiful. But as far as hitting  a fine line challenge, {\an1}this didn't really work out. - This line that's around  these broken pieces doesn't look like  a fine line at all. On the edge  of the tiger's face, there's no fine-line  line work visible. - Damn, that's, like, probably my favorite tattoo I've done since I've been here. - Let's have a look at the biomech face-off. - That one's mine. - This has a very strong  bio look to it. There's some nice,  solid color in this. It's missing  a major component. - Black.  - Heavy black. It's just so washed out  and pale. - I had six hours  to do a biomech tattoo. - Let's take a look at the second tattoo. - That's mine. - This tattoo has  a very unfinished feel. Nothing is put in solid. Even in the more  finished center, all those outlines  are scratch-in weak. It's a mess. - Damn. - I just started to try to scramble {\an1}just to get some shit in there. {\an1}- I want to know the story, 'cause this thing is jacked. - Whew. - All right, let's rank these and see how it unfolds. - I can't tell how any of these rounds are gonna go, really. - Yeah. - Two [bleep] people are going home. I'm, like, ten times more scared going forward. - Either way, it's time for us to face the music. - Let's go. - Let's go. ♪ ♪ - Half of you will be up for elimination and two of you will be going home. - Like, now? - That's [bleep] up. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [rock music] ♪ ♪ - Today, you had to face off in a head-to-head style battle. Each of your tattoos have been ranked by the judges. Win your style battle, and you'll be safe from elimination. Lose, and you could be packing your machines. Half of you will be up for elimination, and two of you will be going home. - That's [bleep] up. - It's time to reveal the winner of each style battle. {\an8}Jason and Jessa, you faced off tattooing tribal. {\an8} Let's see who won  this style battle. {\an8} [dramatic music] - That was mine. - Oh, shit. - Jason, I felt like your design just left your outline {\an1} a lot more open for scrutiny. The more solid black was more of what we're looking  for in a tribal challenge. - Jessa, congratulations. You are safe from elimination. Have a seat. That means, Jason... - [sighs] Yep. {\an1}- You are up for elimination. Jimmy and Hiram, {\an8}you faced off tattooing American traditional. {\an8} Let's see who won  this style battle. ♪ ♪ - I did that one. - Wow. - Nobody outshined anybody in one section, and nothing screams American traditional more than an eagle. {\an1}- I didn't want to just go with the typical thing. Today,  since it's a style battle, you want to really capture that style. - Congratulations, Hiram, you are safe from elimination. - Remember how I helped you out today? {\an1}You're gonna have to help me. - Have a seat. Jerrel and Bob. {\an8} You faced off  tattooing biomech. {\an8}Let's see who won this style battle. - That was mine. - Bob, congratulations. - Thank you. - Jerrel, what happened here with this tattoo? - She let me tattoo her for about three hours or so and then she just quit. - That is one of the breaks in this competition, man. You took a bad one here. {\an1} - If Jerrel would've been able to completely finish  his tattoo, it might've been a different outcome. - I mean, I don't feel like I earned it by any means. - All right, Bob, congratulations. Please have a seat. - Good job, man. - Sorry. {\an8}- Kelly and Raul, you faced off tattooing Japanese. {\an8} Let's reveal the winner  of this style battle. Who did this one? - I did. - Yes, it's clean,  but it defies gravity. - I voted for Kelly just because of the cleanliness. Raul, you have some messiness in there. - Kelly, you are safe from elimination. {\an1}- Thank you. {\an3}- [bleep]. - Frank and Angel. {\an8} You faced off tattooing  fine line black and gray. {\an8} Let's take a look  at who won this style battle. {\an3}- That's mine. {\an1}- Frank, I think you just did {\an8} a huge tattoo  that got out of hand. {\an8} Angel, your design  is a little more cohesive. - Congratulations, Angel. That means that you're safe from elimination. Jason, Jimmy, Jerrel, Raul, Frank. All of you lost your style battle and are up for elimination. - [exhales] {\an1}- Two of you will be going home. - Like, now? - However, you will each have one more chance to fight for your survival. - [bleep], yeah. - Tomorrow, the five of you must face off. - [exhales] - The artist that just defeated you will now have the power to call the shots. - Damn. - Artists, you'll determine the style and subject that all five of the artists facing off must tattoo. - [exhales] Shit. {\an1}- Take a minute and discuss. - What the [bleep] are they gonna pick? [overlapping chatter] - Yeah, cool. - All right, guys, what style and subject must the artists facing off tattoo? - Black and gray illustrative griffin. - [whispering] What is a griffin? - [whispering] I don't [bleep] know. - There's a lot of different versions of the griffin, but the most standard and the most recognizable one is a lion body with a eagle's head, eagle front feet, and eagle wings, and then a lion torso, lion rear legs, and lion tail. {\an7}- [whispering] Jesus Christ. {\an7}- No, I've never [bleep] seen one. - Make everything look as strong and tough and tight as you can, and go in and do the best tattoo you've ever done because tomorrow you're gonna need to. This is the one that two of you are going out on. - Tomorrow, you'll have six hours to tattoo. Head back to the loft, and get ready for tomorrow. - Thank you. - All right. ♪ ♪ - Jimmy's is damn near close to traditional. - It's, like, super flat. - This challenge was set up for me to fail. {\an1}[bleep] snakes. [exciting music] ♪ ♪ {\an1}- It's pretty [bleep] exciting that three people from the West are safe right now. - We're gonna force Jimmy out of his traditional bubble. Finally. - Definitely. - And give Raul something to actually fight with. - Yeah, yeah. - You know, his style. - Raul has a super good chance of winning tomorrow. - If we keep Raul in this competition, Team West is gonna make up half of the eight. - That's how you switch the power, baby. Yeah. - This isn't gonna end well for the people against us no matter what. [tense music] ♪ ♪ - There's five of us  in the bottom, {\an1} and it's a double elimination. {\an8}Two of us out of five are going home. - What style we doing? {\an1}- Just black and gray illustrative. - Favorite. - Kinda like this. - Okay. - The West is definitely  trying to throw me a curveball here  giving me some black and gray, 'cause they don't think that I can do it. This'd be cool up here. This challenge was set up  for me to fail. I need to [bleep] kill this tattoo. [heavy rock music] ♪ ♪ - Artists, the five of you must face off tattooing black and gray illustrative griffins. You have six hours. Your time starts now! - All right, man. - Yo, Jimmy. [clicks tongue] - The amount of pressure  on these tattoos right now is heavier than ever. Two people are going home. - That's a good stencil. - A griffin typically is a symbol of strength. It's like something  that's going into battle. It can't just be some tame little kitten with a parrot wing. - That's a lot of lines in that wing, my friend. {\an1}- I guess today's the day, right? {\an8}- Hit it out of the park, or you're going home. - Ready to roll? - Yes, sir. [tense music] ♪ ♪ - How's it going, buddy? - Good, man. - You got that black and gray, just like you like it. - Gonna be a walk in the park today. This is, like, 50/50. {\an8}Throw me a bone and screw me at the same time. Finally get to do  some black and gray, but I hate fantasy art. {\an1}- Your line work is [bleep] sick-looking, like... - I just want to go bold. - Compared to the other drawings in the room, you're really on. - Here we go again, the only one on my team back in the bottom. And this face-off  is the toughest challenge yet. I've got three veterans  who are all solid tattooers. Jerrel has won tattoo  of the day a couple of times. Not everything in life  is easy, but sometimes, fear is a good thing, you know? You got to face your fears head-on. [suspenseful music] - In my last tattoo, me and him faced off. My canvas walked out. {\an1}- You know, you had like a--had to show a half-finished tattoo. - That's so brutal. - I know  I'm a strong competitor. {\an8}The only reason that I am in the bottom {\an7}is because my canvas walked out, {\an8}not because of my technical ability. - I just walked in, I saw this drawing, and I was like, "Yes!" [laughter] - We had the power to, you know, choose what they were gonna do, and it felt like Jerrel got robbed last time, so you know, we wanted to do something like black and gray. {\an1}Just the strength and stuff. - Yeah, so thank you, guys. I appreciate it. This is my time to shine. I'm gonna kill it. Four hours remaining. You have four hours remaining. ♪ ♪ - What do you usually like tattooing? {\an1}- I usually do more of, like, abstract kind of surrealism, sort of. Ever since I got pardoned,  I've just felt like {\an8}I've had to restrain myself and just put out work {\an8}that I wouldn't ordinarily be happy with. {\an1} I'm [bleep] tired of it, man. I want to do a tattoo that I walk away and I'm proud of. [tattoo machine buzzing] - Ooh, look at you, Jason-- the tricks. - I'm feeling pretty confident  that overall, {\an1}it's the most dynamic drawing that has been done so far  in this competition. {\an3}- Did you see the other drawings? - Jimmy's is damn near close  to traditional. - It's, like, super flat. Like, you guys are drawing in three dimensions and he's drawing in two. - There's a lot of pressure  on me right now 'cause if I go home, it could hurt the Midwest. It could hurt the East. It could hurt our alliance. - How's it looking? - Looks good. - This is not a traditional tattoo. {\an1}- It just has outlines. That's it, you know? Jason and Raul  need to go home. As far as I'm concerned, it's my job to get rid of these mother[bleep]. - Two hours remaining, everybody. Two more hours. ♪ ♪ - I feel like Frank put a little too many {\an1}detailed lines in the wings. {\an3}- Yeah. - Team West is talking so much shit. - His is hard to read. - Yeah. - It's really hard  to shake 'em, and now I'm having feelings of doubt. Angel and Bob walking around looking at everybody. {\an3}Shit's just [bleep] nerve-wracking. - I know they are. But as long as we're here  tomorrow and they're not, I'll be okay. {\an8}This tattoo has to be the best tattoo of the room, 'cause I wanna stay. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - Five, four, three, two, one. That is it. Time is up. Machines down. No more ink. - This tattoo is sick. - That looks [bleep] awesome, man. {\an1}- Look at it. - Hell, yeah. This thing's killer. - [sighs] How you feel, man? - I'm just feeling déjà vu from the last face-off, the three of us. - When we sent Jason home? That one? - Yep. - I mean, I think the biggest difference between this face-off and the last one is, now Jason doesn't have a safety net. - Well, two people are going home today. And I know two of 'em that are safe is me and Jerrel. Who the other two are? That's on you guys. - [exhales] [tense music] ♪ ♪ {\an1}- Today, the five of you had to face off for your survival and you were being tested on technical application. {\an1}Based on your work, two of you will be packing your machines. Let's see how you did. {\an1}Jerrel, let's start with you. - You do have some smooth shading in here. {\an1} Your outline looks very clean. It's very  legible to what it is, and you can see the wings,  you can see the head, you can see the legs,  you can see the arms. You have one of the most flattering overall silhouettes today. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Next up is Jimmy. {\an1}- The drawing, for me, is tough. That tail tuck  makes him scared. {\an1} If you see any animal that's  rearing back from something, it tucks the tail  and it shows fear, and then you have the hands  posed down instead of out. It doesn't look  ferocious enough. But I will say, on technical application day, you have a lot  of really clean outlines and you have  a lot of rich black. And all your shading  is very uniform throughout this  entire tattoo. It does look very smooth, but the overall look of the image is a bummer. - Next up is Jason. - I do love the head. I think you have  the best-drawn head. Your claws and your paws  are cool. I was just trying to make a cool griffin, and I was just going for fantasy art. - The steamy, steamed hair that's coming off  of everything definitely gives me the imprints of mystical, magical. - But you also have some messy stuff. Where the chest and the  shoulder turn into the wing, it's just all guesswork what's  really going on right here. Some mag drag, some whitewash lines, some little shaky,  little lines-- dynamic drawing, but it gets pretty out of control. - So much for artistry. - Raul. - I do like the face. It looks tough. I also do like  that front claw that's open. You see the talons.  You see the strength. You see the grip in it. You do get some soft gray shading in the rock, but in the body, you don't really  get that softness anywhere. And it's a shame because  the whole front neck and the whole front chest  just gets so blacked out. All these little shapes that are underneath  the throat here-- you see a lot of messiness. - Next up is Frank. - You're one of the few people today that gets the proportions on the front legs  and the back legs correct. And this dynamic pullback in that front leg is really beautiful. - But it's not a really strong silhouette 'cause it is kinda  balled up. It's a weird  body position to choose to try to show  what's going on. And for translation  to a tattoo, you need a lot of contrast to let each part of this body  look visible. You look at the hind legs. I can just see shading  that just kinda-- instead of looking smooth like it fades from one area  to the other, it just looks rough. It looks sketched in. It just gets real messy. - Told you it was gonna be a tough one today. - It's a heavy day today. Two people are going home, so the margin for error is very small. It makes it tough. - My heart's invested in this, and I want to make sure that we make the most proper decision we can make. I'm looking at drawing, and I'm looking application. - Strictly from a technical application standpoint, Jimmy had, like, the most solid outline today. - I came down here to send Jimmy home on this drawing. I dislike the tail tuck.  I dislike the appendages. - But when you talk about application, the shading is applied very consistently. Jimmy and Jerrel-- I think they're safe today just on cleanliness. - The reason Jimmy edged himself out is because  at least it's legible. - [chuckles] That's crazy how this turned. {\an1}- So Jerrel and Jimmy are safe. All right, it's time to determine the first artist to pack their machines. {\an1}- Raul's falls pretty short. {\an1} I can find shining examples  of nice work in this tattoo, so don't get me wrong. But if we look closely  at the wing, I see outline problems, I see black saturation problems, and I see shading problems. My vote's for Raul. {\an3}- Raul. - The judges have decided. Raul, you do not have what it takes to be Ink Master. - You've been a very strong member of a very strong team. I know they're gonna miss you leaving, man. - This has been one hell of an experience. I just want to say, "Boys, Daddy's coming home." [sighs] - Please pack your machines and close shop. ♪ ♪ - Top ten. Pretty proud of that. The most pressure  in this competition was really  leaving home behind. My wife is my best friend, and my kids  are the loves of my life. I miss 'em like crazy, and I'm definitely going home with a really good message  for my boys. You're not gonna know how far you can go unless you try. ♪ ♪ - We are not done yet. It's time to determine the second artist that's going home. - This next one's gonna be tough. - Frank and Jason, up for elimination. - I'm torn between both. - I came in here thinking that Jason had tattoo of the day, {\an1}and I literally flip-flopped to wanting to send him home. - Over this drawing? - It's not the drawing, man. It's the tattooing. {\an1}The head and the claws do not match the rest of the tattoo. {\an1}- I love this drawing the most. - Zoom in to just the chest and look at the chest like this. You couldn't tell me  that's feathers. - Right, but the idea of a tattoo {\an1}isn't to look at a part of it. - It is for me. If, as a boss and the owner of a shop, I would. {\an1}- I understand, but I will say the one silhouette that I have a hard time with is Frank's. I don't know what it is  when I'm looking at it, so for that reason, my vote's for Frank. - But application, we say all the time, is first and foremost in everything you do. With that being said, my mind is made up. Jason. - You can't just abandon clean tattooing at any point in this competition and expect to stay. My vote's for Jason. - The judges have decided. Jason, you do not have what it takes to be Ink Master. - Wow. - You're an amazing artist, man, but you're just not the play-it-safe kind of guy. My hat's off to you. - Thanks. - Please pack your machines and close shop. ♪ ♪ - South struggled a lot. We just parked ourselves  at the bottom. We got maybe, like, a flat tire or something. Couldn't find a jack, but honestly, the longer  I was in this competition, the more that I realized  I'm happiest when I'm just doing the tattoos that I want to do-- something unique,  something different. I'm only gonna be happy if I'm me. ♪ ♪ announcer: On the next episode  of "Ink Master"... - It's us three, and we have to fight through five of them. We're out for blood. - Angel's not playing games today. - No. - I wanted a fight. - I don't want a cop-out either. My team bothers me so much. - Do you think that Jerrel would make a play to get you out of the house? - I honestly don't know. Out of the three of you guys, Bob had the worst tattoo out of the bunch. {\an1}- Aw, come on, give me a break. - Crazy choice. A lot of problems today. - If you want to win, then you've got to take your time and win. {\an8} [rock music] {\an8} ♪ ♪
