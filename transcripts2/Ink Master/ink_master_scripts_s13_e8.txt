 - Good job, guys. - All right. - Impressive. - You are all safe from elimination. West, South, and East, it's now up to you to decide which artist on your team was the weakest. - The only thing I've been considered for is the bottom. {\an1}Clearly, I'm the weakest link. - I wanna make the best decision that we can to ensure that we stay together.

 announcer:  Raul, Jimmy, and Jason tattooed for their lives. - You can take the day off now, if you want to. Jimmy's gonna kill it. - That doesn't mean I won't kill it. - If Jimmy or Jason goes home, it changes everything. - It's a tough one, man, {\an8}three good tattoos. {\an8} I like Jason's drawing, {\an8} but whip shading is the  foundation of traditional. - Jason, you do not have what it takes to be Ink Master. - No [bleep] way, man. - Holy shit.

This is just gonna motivate me to [bleep] make sure I knock out as many of you I can get out as I can. - For me, I know the competition in this house isn't gonna be the same without him. - No. - Definitely not. ♪ ♪ - Whoo! Y'all didn't think I was going, did ya? - [bleep] knew it. - Oh, my God. - Oh, no, bad news. Only two pardons left. - They couldn't send home a tattoo that was that great, man. - Can't leave Jordi behind. - Yeah. - He was just about to tell us {\an1}how he was gonna have to take us all out. - Not alone, he won't. {\an1}- That's a [bleep] good thing. - You know, I just assumed that there was probably a good six of you that was gonna go home before I was. So I just kind of been dick off a little bit. - This guy. - Ah. - You know what's [bleep] up? - What? - I just missed you a whole bunch, and like-- {\an1}- I know, and now you don't. {\an1}- Well, now that you're back, and we all had our moment, can we get back to [bleep] business? - What's the business? - Beating you, and you can [bleep] back out of here. - Yeah. - I'm waiting on you guys. ♪ ♪ [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [rock music] ♪ ♪ - Welcome. {\an1}Four teams are still standing, the Turf War rages on. - But only one of you will earn $100,000, a feature in "Inked" magazine, and the title of Ink Master. - That's right. - All right. - For this flash challenge, you will once again win or lose as a team. - Gotcha, fellas. - This week, we're testing color theory. - Oh, shit. {\an8}What the [bleep] is color theory? Do you know about color theory? - A little bit. - Thank God you're on our team. - Right, yeah. - It's just using  the right colors so that everything is just complimentary to each other. It's like playing  the wrong notes on a guitar. {\an8}Everything can sound really pretty, {\an8}and you're like, "Yeah." And then you hit  that wrong note, and it's painful. You throw one wrong color  in there, and it starts to look like a disaster. - You ready, bro? - We gotta be. - Today, you must create a colorful masterpiece, {\an1}one piece of candy at a time. - What the [bleep], though? - Sweet. - I've never thought  about candy as a viable art from. {\an8}Shit's sweet, you eat it. That's the end of the story. {\an7}- Oh, my God, dude. {\an8}Hell yeah! I'm all about it. - Using nothing but glue and over half a million pieces of candy. [dramatic music] Each team must create a sweet work of art on a eight-foot  by eight-foot canvas. - They're kidding, right? - This is gonna be [bleep] insane. - We have a huge surface  to cover here, {\an8}and every piece of candy is, like, the size {\an8}of my [bleep] fingernail. {\an8} - How many candies we gonna  have to put on that wall {\an8} in order to fill it? {\an8}It's so much sugar. - The winners of this flash challenge {\an1}will have the power to assign all of the human canvases in the elimination tattoo. - [exhales sharply] - Fail to impress us, {\an1}and we will not sugarcoat it.

Something like that. - I'm down for that. - If I was  on one of these teams, I would eat more candy  than I put on the wall. - Ooh, I like these. This is nice. - I love candy! I love candy. Candy. - What about a big, creepy, [bleep] evil clown? - That'd be cool and weird. - All right, sure. Let's do it. - I'm cool with it. For the first time  in team East history, {\an8}we are going with the first idea {\an8}that was thrown out. Like, one of those funhouse entrances where you walk {\an1}into the crazy clown's mouth? I love that. - I looks like the West are still figuring out what they're doing. - Well, just don't let the West see what we're doing. - We could do, like, a fruit basket, so we can show a lot of different colors. - That's basic, you know what I mean? - What if a big--one fruit, maybe, like, a pineapple? - Pineapple with, like, an umbrella in it, {\an1}you know, like it's a drink. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like that. {\an1}- Five hours left, everybody. Five hours.

They try to take my teammate out, I can't be the same Jordi. {\an8}I have to make sure {\an8}I cut everyone's throats. {\an8}- I do think this is pretty complicated. {\an8}If we commit to this, we gotta fill the whole thing. {\an8}- Yeah, I mean, we gotta think simple. {\an8} People are starting  to lay candy, {\an8}and we are still [bleep] around with our drawing. - Is there any other idea? - What if we did, like, the floaty--like, floatation animals? Like, a little--or, like-- - Like, a unicorn? Like, a unicorn, like, floaty. - A unicorn floaty. - All right, let's do this. [tense music] - I think we're starting  to do okay at flash challenges, guys. I think we're starting  to get the hang of it. - Dude, every other team has won one now. We are due. God, it's so weird how soft they are. - Squishy candy. {\an1}- [laughs] Ew, stop. - Yucky. - Yeah. That's a disgusting sound. - Ooh! [in baby voice] Frankie, do you like candy? I like candy. - Oh, no, is he gonna do that the whole [bleep] time? - Ooh, Jerrel! - [laughs] [bleep] creepy as shit, dude. - Ooh. {\an1}- And then Jimmy slaughtered everyone in that warehouse. - [laughs] {\an3}- Stop laughing. {\an1}- She said, "Stop laughing." {\an8}- I'm just over here minding my own business, {\an8}trying to boost up the morale of my team. {\an3}Mushy the Clown. - [laughs] - Everything I do pisses off Angel. - The angry west coast doesn't like laughter. - [in baby voice] We're gonna win, K, {\an1}'cause we're winners.

Kelly is literally gluing so slow. - Do you wanna help me work on this? - Yes, I do. - I already know I'm gonna have to jump in there and help them both. {\an8}That's why this "team crap"--like, no. I'll play this team stuff  as long as I have to, and then I'm going to make the best decision for me. [tense music] ♪ ♪ {\an1}That there. [candy clacking] {\an1}- You hear that sound? ♪ ♪ - Five, four, three, two, one. That is it. Time is up. {\an3}- [laughs] - Look at his shoes. - Look at him. - I hate candy. - All right, it is time to critique your work. South, you're up. - You have a very recognizable image. The part about the design  that I do like is where you have the beveled  edge on the arrows and the drop shadow  on the little cup pieces that show a little bit  of dimension. - But the color theory on this one is pretty plain. The orange  with the darker border and the blue is very similar  to the red and the pink. It doesn't make it jump out,  because now you have the foreground  and the background {\an1} one tone off of each other. It just doesn't create a dynamic look. {\an8} [dispiriting music] {\an1}- Well, I mean, Jason did get a pardon last night. {\an1}They're not gonna go easy on him. - True. - East, you're up. - I really like a lot of things you do here. I mean, that heavy contrast,  very visible, very fun, very playful image. - I love the creativity of the hair. Using those Twizzlers  to your advantage here really works. But your teeth are white, the face paint is white,  the eyes have white in them. Again, don't know that color theory, today, you knocked out of the box. - I don't know. I like the play. Let's see how this goes. Thanks, guys. - I think we're getting better and better at these flash challenges. - Midwest, you're next. - I really like the color play here. All of the highlights are  in the same place, in the same directions. - To show us that this is a green bottle, you used, like,  eight or nine shades. And to show us  that this is a yellow banana, you used three or four shades,  which, to me, is beautiful color theory. - Cool. - Awesome. - West, you're up. {\an1}Guys, I love what you did here, especially in that water, {\an1} how meticulously you placed each one of those strands  of candy. {\an1} - As far as color theory goes, I wish you didn't do the blue in the inner tube, 'cause you take away  from all the beautiful water. - For me, the big bummer of the piece is the moldy broccoli. - It's exploding. - I understand what it's supposed to be. I just wish it was more legible. {\an3}- That's not how I saw that going. I thought that was pretty [bleep] cool. - I did too. - All right, judges. It is time to determine a winner of this flash challenge. - My favorite concept and my favorite design is definitely the East. Super cool, I just wish they hit the mark a little bit more on showing some more color theory. - For me, the Midwest achieved a lot of nice tones by using similar tones. - Based on how many different colors they put together to create a really dynamic, {\an1}surprising look, the Midwest. - For me, the Midwest today, for sure. - [bleep], my dudes. - Thanks. Thank you. - The judges have decided the winner of this flash challenge is the Midwest. Congratulations, guys. - Awesome. - As a team, you'll have the power to assign all the human canvases in the elimination tattoo. - I'm all about it. The more that we win  as a team, {\an7}we just pick up more momentum, kind of like a snowball  rolling downhill. {\an1} We have to bulldoze the West,  we have to bulldoze the South, and make sure that all three of us are in the finale. - And you can all head back to the loft. - Thank you. - All right, thank you. - Good job, big sexy. - Right? [laughs] [dramatic music] - Oh, man, this is gonna get real wacky. - And we're putting it where? - On my ribs. - Wow. - Okay. - That's a lot. - Seriously, that's not happening. [tense music] ♪ ♪ - So you guys have skull picks again today. Last time, I know we had this alliance, and you were looking to give us the pieces that we really wanted, and it didn't really work out that way. - I'll make sure that all the very difficult ones go to the West immediately. I'm gonna, you know, sprinkle the South with some too. - Someone from the West has to go home. {\an1}It's gotta give at some point. - I'm definitely fighting for everybody in this room. - I appreciate that. [dramatic music] - I feel like the East and the Midwest are definitely buddying up right now. - Oh, 100%. - Have you noticed that? - They're together. It is East-Midwest, Midwest-East. {\an1}- Where they're going with it is basically so they can aim at either your team or my team every single time. {\an1}- Mm-hmm, I do wanna see the cycle {\an1}of the Midwest and East stop. {\an1}I mean, thing is, is that I got the pardon, and that means that I have to conform my tattooing. Doesn't mean I have to conform being an asshole. {\an1}If anything, it means that I have to talk shit harder, because I have to force people into [bleep] up. - Your enemies are my enemies. Keep talking shit. - I think we should shake things up. - Let's do it. [rock music] ♪ ♪ - Welcome to the elimination tattoo. Based on your work, one of you will lose your shot at $100,000 and the title of Ink Master. - I ain't going nowhere. - Not today. - Remember, Oliver and Chris still have the power to pardon one artist. {\an1}If an artist receives a pardon, they will immediately reenter the competition. {\an8}- Yeah. {\an8}- Today, you must push your creativity to the limit {\an8}and create a new school a food tattoo. {\an8}- What? {\an8} - What's gonna show off  color theory {\an7}more than a new school tattoo? {\an8}They're super colorful, bright tattoos {\an7} with a lot of dynamic shapes. {\an8}I'm down to eat that up. {\an8}- Oh, man, this is gonna get real wacky. {\an8}Food tattoos in general are a little strange to me. {\an8}- You need to stop trying to make art out of food. Food is to be eaten. Just eat it! {\an1}Are you sure we can't do black and gray? [laughter] - We want something that's gonna be bold and graphic, but it's gonna give us a playful look at a food tattoo. - Seriously? - Sick. - It's all about creativity. It's all about drawing. Now it's time to go for broke, no holding back. - I'm hungry for the win. I don't know about you guys. - Remember, the team whose artist wins tattoo of the day will select one other team to form the jury of peers. Together, both teams will deliberate and put one artist up for elimination. - Let's meet your canvases. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Midwest, you won the flash challenge. You now have the power to assign the human canvases. This is your chance to take control of the game. So don't mess it up. {\an7}- Uh-huh. {\an7}- This is my chance to bring {\an8}the South down to one, and if I have the opportunity to fire at the West, it's what I'm gonna do every time. - I want a New Mexican green chili riding a raging bull, jumping over a chef knife. - I'm glad you're here. - Yeah. - That's a lot. - Chicken and waffles holding hands on my thigh. {\an8}- Brown and brown and also some golden brown on your golden brown skin  doesn't equal a very dynamic  and colorful tattoo. That's not happening. - A New Orleans beignet with powdered sugar. - What?  A beignet? What the hell is that? {\an8}Isn't that the thing that washes your butthole? - Some beignets don't really look like anything. - Just like a big...crust. {\an3}- That's easy. - New-school California taco holding a surfboard and a can of beer. - Oh, that's sick. - And we're putting it where? - On my ribs. - Oh. - On the ribs? - Nope. - No, no, no, no, no. - On the ribs,  your skin's thinner, {\an1} you're more prone to blowouts. Whoever gets that one, see ya later. - Texas-style barbecue ribs on a barbecue with a hanging pig on my ribs. - Oof. - Wow. - Okay. - Ribs on the ribs? {\an1}- It's too much stuff going on: a barbecue, ribs, a pig. Two ribs on the line, {\an8}both of 'em want too much. They're gonna come for us. They could give us all ribs. - It sounds like there are some complicated ones. - Yeah, the one with the ribs, the barbecue. - With the hanging pig? - Yeah. Which ones are the simpler ones? We definitely wanna, you know, hit East with those. - Yeah.  - I'm really hoping {\an8}the Midwest, today, doesn't throw anyone {\an8}the wrong skull by accident again. {\an8}- [bleep] yourself. {\an7} - Looking at past skull picks, {\an8} hasn't turned out  so well for them. {\an7}So I'm not really that worried {\an8}about what they're gonna choose. That's the curse  of the golden skull. - You'll need that. - Thank you. {\an1}- On the ribs, forever? - Yes. - There you go. {\an1}- This is gonna be a great one for you. {\an8}- Thank you. {\an8}- Dude. {\an8}- Canvases, one by one, please read the artist's name on the bottom of your skull. - Hiram. - What's up, brother? - Kelly. - Jimmy. - Frank. - Hell yeah. - K. - Hi. {\an1} A beignet is a brown pastry with white powdered sugar  on it, {\an8}and I'm supposed to show color theory? - Jessa. {\an8}- Hey.

Oh, God, sweet. {\an1}It's the chili riding a bull. - Yeah, that's a fun one. - Yeah, yeah. {\an1}- That one's dynamic. - What do he want again? - Taco. - Bob. - I knew it. Hey. The beer and the surfboard  and the taco, {\an8}that's kind of the chilled, relaxed life {\an8}that I like to live. {\an8}But seriously, that's a lot of shit, and it's on your ribs. - Angel. - Right here. [tense music] - Raul. - Heyo. - What is it? - It was barbecue ribs on the ribs. - Jordi. - Whoop, how you doing? Man, ribs on ribs on ribs,  too many pigs in a pigsty. {\an8}[bleep] that. - You'll have six hours to demonstrate color theory by creating a new school food tattoo. But based on your work, one of you will be packing your bags. - Phew. - Good luck. - All right. - How's it going? Bob. - My station's this way. {\an8}- New school takes the element of what it is {\an8}and then stretches it, warps it, adds faces to it, makes 'em  into living characters. They're fun. - Doing a crawfish? {\an3}- Yeah. {\an1}- What color is that in, typically? - Like, reds. - When you have something that's fun, and it's, like, a child's toy, it should be bright  and vibrant, {\an1}and it should make you smile. {\an1}- I'm gotta play with color {\an1}a little bit on this thing. {\an1}Maybe some, like, blue light on the top of them, just a little bit. - If these artists can't nail what piece of food we're looking at, then they've already lost. - You want a beignet? - Yeah. - All right. - With powdered sugar. - I'm worried about K and Jessa. - Chicken and waffles. {\an1}This, like, one of my favorite foods. {\an3}- Oh, perfect. - Both of the images are brown. There's not a lot of room  for color play there. {\an1}- So this is a color challenge. {\an1}Are you into me incorporating, like, a second flower with it? - It's the curse  of the golden skull. {\an8}You get skull picks, and you [bleep] it all up. {\an8}- How do I make it more weird, Jimmy? {\an8}- Well, you gotta make it exaggerated somehow. {\an8}The cup of coffee should be cartoony. {\an8}- I learned how to draw a coffee mug {\an8}so it looks like a coffee mug, and now I've gotta, like, {\an1} bend it all over the place. And whenever I try  to distort it, it just looks wrong. Like, not cool, just bad. I feel like the more I draw this cup, the less I like it. - Make it, like, shorter and fatter. - Okay, so I should just redraw the whole thing. - Don't redraw the whole thing. - All right. - Don't stress out. {\an3}- It's just [bleep] frustrating.

[dramatic music] - Let me think about that. ♪ ♪ So my canvas is like, "I don't like coffee. Can you change that to a jar of jam?" - What? - Just right now? - Yeah. {\an8}New school is, like, {\an8}the antithesis of what my natural style is.

I'm getting stressed out. ♪ ♪ - Artists, you have six hours to create a new school food tattoo, and your time begins now. - Cool, let's do this. - Come around this way. - Let me just make sure the size is okay, all right? - Okay.  - If there's one tattoo style {\an8}that plays with color theory the most, it's new school. - Let me see that big [bleep] sexy bicep you've got, all right? - We're looking for exaggerated proportions, dynamic dimensions, do something wild,  make it pop. {\an1}- Nice, it fits in there great. Sometimes, it looks like I know what I'm doing. - The other thing  about this challenge is doing the food. {\an1} It needs to be recognizable. If you do a sandwich, and it doesn't look like  a sandwich, you didn't do a good job. - I'm gonna start over here, okay? - Yep. [rock music] - Off we go on this cute little munchkin. - I can't wait. ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] - For the love of God. Everybody's already started tattooing.

But the last time the Midwest  had the skull pick, I got tattoo of the day. So maybe they should just keep coming at me. This is my second time here. - Hmm. - And it's like my long-lost abusive lover. I just keep coming back. The first time I came to this competition, I knew that no matter what happened, the people in my life  would be proud of me. Now I have people depending  on me. I'm a shop owner. If I don't bring home the title, I'm gonna have some [bleep] explaining to do. It's pretty cool, dude. I'm not gonna lie. - Yeah. - Three hours to go. {\an1} You have three hours to go.

So there's always, like, so much food. {\an8}Growing up, my grandma never liked tattoos. She always told me  that they weren't for ladies, and I actually gave her  her first tattoo. From then on,  she's just, like, gung ho. She will just stop everyone  in her path, and just be like, "My granddaughter tattoos." Like, "You should come see her." We've come a long way. I think if I had to get a food tattoo, I would get some sort of pasta. My tattoo was the chicken and waffles, but I've changed it to waffles and ice cream. At least I've got some color in there to make it pop. - You could use some sort of glow, just like a white or pink. {\an8} - No matter what,  this waffle is gonna look really flat, because it's almost the same color as her tan. That sucks, dude. I didn't just [bleep] leave  my family {\an1} and leave my shop to come here and get eliminated  because I got given a [bleep] waffle. ♪ ♪ - My team's definitely in hot water here. The only way that I can help  is if make sure {\an8}I focus on this tattoo and get tattoo of the day. - It's absolutely new school traditional. You might start a new fad. - Jesus Christ, Jason. - He's trying to ruffle your feathers, get you off your game. - This crawfish looks like he's about to get  cooked alive. And I'm cool with that, because the South  and the West, they're about to get  cooked alive. And I about to paint a [bleep] portrait of their destiny. [bleep] him.

It's definitely something that I, you know--I wish I would have started a long time ago. It's hard to imagine myself doing something different now. {\an8}You know, I got lucky, and I got a pardon. But I feel like  I'm stuck in a box. Nobody with ADD likes being in a [bleep] box. I promised that I was  gonna just try to stick to the challenge. It's torture. First tattoo  after getting a pardon, if I do a bad job and I go home, it's like, "Crap." It's pressure. ♪ ♪ - You drew that? - Yeah. - You're a cartoonist, aren't ya? {\an1}- I used to do graffiti. There's no way I would have had these lines {\an1}as crispy as this on the ribs. {\an1}So, like, I came here when I was four months old. When I was younger, I got in trouble for doing graffiti. {\an3}- Oh, shit. {\an1}- And at the time, I was in the middle of the process of getting my residency. {\an1}So I thought I was gonna get deported. Kind of, like, scared the shit out of me. So I, like, stopped doing art  for ten years, but I realized art was  my number one love. {\an8}So that's when I went back and got my art degree.

K's is not new school. It basically looks like  a K tattoo that she threw  two extra colors in. - I'm super happy with how bright it is and how clean it is. - Yeah, it's, like, popping with color. {\an1}- They're so far off from new school. [tense music] - What did you do that you thought was new school? - Get in, get out. You don't need to do something {\an1}that's impossible to work off. - Where's the bam? Where's the zing-zing? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - I've been suspicious that the Midwest and the East have been buddying up for a while. Jason basically confirmed everything. If one of them wins tattoo of the day, they automatically have jury of peers, and they automatically put either South or West down, no matter what. Now I'm not saying we should buddy up with the South or anything like that. It's more so we just have a common enemy at the moment. - Jason, even though, like, we don't like that he has a big mouth, we can use that to our advantage. Jason's not gonna sit quiet about something. If he thinks somebody should go home, he's gonna say something. - And until the Midwest-East alliance is broken, there's no harm in kind of siding with the South for a little while. - If we can team up with anybody that will help us, I think we should do it. - It's a balance of power. [rock music] ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - Today, you had to show color theory {\an1}with a new school food tattoo. Let's see how you did. Midwest, you had the advantage. Let's start with you. - Kelly. - The drawing of the dog is super cute. The details in the condiments  on the top, very cool. - But your contrast in here gets a little bit muted. So as far as a clean tattoo,  you definitely hit it. As far as new school, it's more of a miss. ♪ ♪ - Jerrel. ♪ ♪ - From the color theory side, you really hit this thing, especially  in the whipped cream, where you use four colors  to that dollop some dimension. - Yeah. - The purple comes over the back,  goes into the brown, butts up to the green. That's good color theory. ♪ ♪ - Frank. ♪ ♪ - I like it. Is it new school?  No. Is it just a color  illustration drawing? Yes. {\an1}There is no real color theory or some crazy shape of the lobster. It's new school day.  This is the day to go wild. This is the day  to be creative. Where's the wow? Where's the bam? Where's the zing-zing? - [bleep]. I thought I was going for it. I guess I wasn't. - West, you're next. Raul. ♪ ♪ - Fellas. - I think this is one of your strongest outings. {\an1} - My favorite part is the hand in the foreground. I like the color theory. I like how you take that front of the thumb, you leave that skin break  in it to show the light. Little purple,  little darker purple, and the blue. - But what's the defining characteristics of a bagel? Has a hole in middle. Without the hole, is it a bagel? ♪ ♪ - Hiram. ♪ ♪ {\an1}- Talking about color theory, and you're gonna put ice blue next to yellow,  and the thing in between the ice blue and the yellow is  gonna be the bun. You don't have color theory  there, because you don't have  a pop. The tattoo falls short {\an1}on how you play your colors. ♪ ♪ {\an7}- You did a good job, man. - Angel. ♪ ♪ - The face on the buffalo's very cute, but your color play here is  super stale and flat. - This whole hindquarter  of the buffalo, I just can't imagine  a positive reason to choose that color. - That's the "we're never doing that again" color. - It's a bad choice. ♪ ♪ - Bob. - All right, let's "taco" 'bout it. - The design is cool, but your color palette {\an1} and these colors put together is where your composition  takes a turn. - The red in the tomatoes and the green in the lettuce,  bright. The rest of the tattoo is  just all the same muted tones throughout. This whole tattoo is  camouflaged like crazy. ♪ ♪ - That was a tough one. - [whistles] - South, you're up. Jason. ♪ ♪ - The color in this tattoo is  beat. {\an1} - I underestimated his skin. As soon as I hit it  with needle, I was like, "Oh, that's not great." - I actually love the front of this drawing. Why don't you just do  the guy riding a bull and do no background and be done? Get in, get out. You don't need to do something that's impossible to work off. ♪ ♪ - Jordi. ♪ ♪ Your pig is so legible, then your eye goes lower  and there's so much darkness and contrast issues,  and it's very difficult to figure out what this pig is hanging over. - Then off to the side of this smoke that's billowing off of it, you have this other feature. - It's supposed to be the top of the grill. {\an1} - I don't know that it's ribs. I don't know  that it's a grill. - It's just like, I have no idea what I'm looking at. ♪ ♪ - East, you're up next. Jessa. ♪ ♪ - As far as color theory here goes, there's no pop in this. It's flat.  It's boring. The transition  of magenta to pink, well,  it looks like sidewalk chalk. For what it is, it should be blasted with color, and these colors  really just play into your canvas' skin tone. You can do color palettes that are not the real color palette of the real thing. - You just don't hit the mark on this one. - God damn. - K. ♪ ♪ - What did you do that you thought was new school? - Exaggerating the shape  of the top flower {\an1}and the shape of the jam jar. - I don't think you made an outrageous shape  of anything. - It looks like a painterly life study. ♪ ♪ - Jimmy. ♪ ♪ - This has a very new-school feel. The shading in the lemon  with the blue on one side. The lobster with the yellow  on one side {\an1} and the blue one the other. {\an1} You have a little bit of green in the eyes, and you throw a little bit of green  into the tail and a little bit of green  into the leaf. The color play makes the dynamics of the image. Super cool. - Thank you. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ - All right, judges, time to determine who had the best tattoo of the day. - Immediately, obviously, Jimmy is a strong contender. - For the best color pop  and color saturation and vibrant, I'm going with Jimmy. ♪ ♪ - I'm with Jimmy. - The judges have decided the best tattoo of the day goes to Jimmy. - That's a first. - Ever? - Ever. - Hell yeah, man. - Welcome to "Ink Master." - Thanks. - That means the East will form a jury of peers with one other team. - Our vote's definitely gonna be for the Midwest. - All right. - The East and the Midwest will form the jury of peers. You must deliberate and put one artist up for elimination. You can all head back to the loft. ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] - Congrats on winning tattoo of the day. - I mean, I think that shows that I'm more than just a one-trick pony. {\an1}- No, that shows that you did the cleanest tattoo in the room. I think it's safe to assume that it's either gonna be me, Jordi, Bob. It's gonna be somebody in this group of people {\an1}that's getting voted to the bottom. We already know that, and that's fine. No matter which one of us five you put down, we're coming back up. [tense music] - All right, we're here as a jury of peers along with our trusted friends in the Midwest to determine who had the worst tattoo of the day. - If there's a definite two that the judges are picking, I believe they may be picking both Jessa and K. - Definitely me. I know I completely missed  the challenge. - But if you look  at the line work and the saturation, and then go back to Jordi, the saturation is not there  like it is in K's. - That's true.  - Right. Jordi's does not have color  theory. I didn't know that was ribs, and I gave him that tattoo. - But Jason had the worst application in the room. - There's so much background  that doesn't actually need to be there. - But I think that he hits new school more than mine. {\an8} He has a lot  of strong points here {\an8} that I may not be able  to defend against. {\an1}- If we send Jason down, it will ignite the fire within him. - Jordi's not a fighter. When he's down there in the bottom, he folds. - That's very true. - Something to consider, for sure. - Today, we're testing color theory {\an1}with new school food tattoos. - Man, there's a couple people that really fell short. - K's tattoo doesn't have any new school look to it, and the color play  and color theory in it is just as bad. - At least K's looks like something. - Jordi's tattoo looks like a little turd laying in a smoke basket and then  this poor pig smelling {\an1} what's going on underneath. - [laughs] - You know who I was shocked by was Jason. - Everywhere  that there's color, it's not saturated. The black is scratchy. - However, I would wear Jason's bull than Jessa's waffle thing. The idea of a new school  ice cream cone just being tilted off  to the left a little bit really undersells  the new school-ness. - Ugh. - East and Midwest are deliberating right now, and they're gonna choose one artist to put up for elimination. And who they pick can really mix up how this thing shakes out. - We don't know which [bleep] way it's gonna go. All know is, if I go down, punches are getting thrown. [ominous music] - [exhales sharply] ♪ ♪ - All right, jury of peers, which artist are you sending down for elimination? ♪ ♪ {\an1}- The jury of peers have decided to put... ♪ ♪ Jordi up for elimination. - All right, in the bottom, we'll see Jordi... K...and Jessa. See y'all downstairs. [dramatic music] - Hey, man I've seen you down there before, but this time, I wanna see you fight. - Like, seriously. - Yeah, I'm ready. Sorry, guys, don't take anything personal. - We're sorry too. - You guys ready? - Let's do this. - All right. {\an1}- You give 'em hell down there, okay? - It's the only thing we can do. {\an1}- You too. - Just gonna [bleep] fight for it. ♪ ♪ - Today, you were being tested on color theory. And based on your work, one of you will be packing your machines. Jimmy, why did the jury of peers vote Jordi to the bottom? - We felt like Jordi's was definitely the most illegible. And as far as color theory  goes, it's kind of out  of the window. - Kind of obvious I was gonna get picked. 1/3 of the jury of peers is down here with me. - This tattoo has definitely got some {\an1} questionable imagery in it. The bottom part  of this tattoo is one of the most un-legible tattoos of the day. - But I felt like I did attempt to do the ask. I just feel like K's--she didn't even try to do new school. {\an1}- I don't think that I ended up {\an1}with a very new school piece. {\an1}I'm not gonna try to stand here and say that; that'd be ridiculous. But I did try  to distort things and add different perspective  to it. - It's stale, man. You gotta push the envelope. - I am exhibiting the brightest color {\an8} that's in the tattoos  that are here. {\an8} I mean, especially  if I look at Jordi's tattoo. - But you do have the worst outline. - I am making intelligent color choices within the piece. - Of the three that are down here, K's is the most legible. - But it's the furthest from new school. - I would rather wear either mine or K's tattoo. I think I tried to give you bright color. - Your color choices are really boring and stagnant. The purple-magenta stripe  that you put into it without fading it  or blending it, this is just straight  application issues from the technical side, and it doesn't work today. ♪ ♪ - All three of these tattoos have {\an1}technical application problems. {\an8} All three of these tattoos  have drawing problems. {\an8} All three of these tattoos  have problems {\an8} hitting the challenge. - I look at Jordi's tattoo, I see a pig. I don't know what I see  underneath it, but I see a pig. I look at K's tattoo, it's obviously some kind of pastry. But I'm having the hardest time reading Jessa's tattoo. - But out of the three, hers is the most new school-y. Jordi's, man, when you have a tattoo that's not a cover-up  that looks like a cover-up, {\an1}that's one of the big killers. My vote's for Jordi. ♪ ♪ {\an8}- Because I dislike all three of these equally, {\an8} I will bring it to which one  I would least like to eat. ♪ ♪ And for that, Jordi, I don't know what's in that pot. So my vote is for Jordi. ♪ ♪ - The judges have decided, Jordi, you do not have what it takes to be Ink Master. - I appreciate the opportunity. I definitely learned a lot. - Keep your head up, man. You have the right attitude. You're gonna take what you got here and you're gonna apply it and you're gonna keep going. - Please pack your machines and close shop. [ominous music] - It's frustrating  not to make it farther. All I can do is take  what I learned, {\an1}apply it to my future tattoos and just become a better artist. I feel bad for Jason.  Now he's by himself. {\an1}It's like him versus everybody. I'm more disappointed for that than for me not doing what I wanna do. I want Jason to represent team South, and I want him to take it all the way to the end. ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] {\an1} narrator: On the next episode of "Ink Master"... {\an1} - I'm still in attack mode. {\an1}We gotta keep hitting the West, 'cause they need to lose. - Let's get it. {\an1} - We get an artistry challenge and my opinion doesn't matter to you. I feel like you're weak and [bleep] stupid. - There's an inner struggle  between the team. - What they've set up is destined to self-destruct. - I'm trying to stay in this bitch. I'm not trying to go home. Team of one. I'm just a duck in a pond waiting to get shot now. - Do you think you can get out of your head? {\an8} [upbeat rock music] {\an8} ♪ ♪
