 announcer:  The South fought back {\an1} in the first flash challenge. - Know what I like about those palm trees? They look like money. - The winner of this flash  challenge is... the South. {\an1}- That's what I like to see. announcer:  In the elimination tattoo... - There's gonna be some mad people today. - There's gonna be some real mad people. - Just as I suspected,  Jason kicked all of us right in the gut. - Well, you know, we're doing the best pieces out here, we shouldn't--

 {\an1}- Everybody is cruising on our side. [woman shrieks] {\an1} - I don't know what Emac did, but we're gonna need a miracle here. announcer:  In the elimination, Arlene, K, and Emac were the bottom  three artists. - I was actually gonna nominate myself to come down here. - I mean, you're sitting pretty. {\an1}- Not when your own teammate throws you to the bottom. {\an1}- Can I just say something? You know, I didn't come all the way the [bleep] over here to go home. - As far as the most finished look overall, I think Arlene has it. As far as the most  solid foundation of an idea and of a design, I like K's. - In Emac's tattoo, there's areas where your lines  don't connect. - The technical issues are the most challenging. - Emac, you do not have what it takes to be Ink Master.

Mm! - So glad you're here. - This is... - Super stressful. ♪ ♪ - There she is. - Miss me? - Oh, yeah. - Man. - What a relief. - It took a little longer than normal. - What happened? - Well, I actually nominated myself to the bottom. - How does that work? - I was just not feeling it no more. I think it was real shitty that Jason threw me in the bottom. {\an1}- It's called having integrity. - Opinions are like assholes; everyone has one. - What I saw downstairs was three tattooers fighting to stay here and one person trying to go home for no reason. - It wasn't even about you. You had a [bleep] comfy seat right there, man. - With how much experience you have, did you think that you were gonna come here {\an1}and it was just gonna be easy? - We all gonna be in the bottom eventually. You don't have to take it personally. - You're one of the best tattooers in this room. I want you to make this a fight, because if anybody out here can take you out, they know they earned it. ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - Welcome. To win this turf war, you must fight for survival alongside your team. - We got this. - But ultimately, only one of you will earn $100,000, {\an1}a feature in "Inked" magazine, {\an1}and the title of Ink Master. - Cross that bridge when we come to it, right? - Today there is no flash challenge. - What? - Curveball. - We are moving directly into a tattoo marathon. - A marathon? - Oh, shit. - Oh, [bleep]. - It never stops. - Here we go. - In each round of the marathon, you must impress us with creative tattoos that prove you have what it takes to get to the end. - All right. Creativity in tattooing is what gives it  that wow factor. {\an7}If you don't have creativity, {\an8}then you're not going to stand out in a crowd of tattooers. - For the first round, you can tattoo {\an1}any style or subject you want. - I like that. {\an1}- I'm down with that. - But... - There's always a "but." - You must collaborate with your team. {\an1}- Oh, it's about to get real. - Oh, no. - God damn. - Each team will create one tattoo on one human canvas. - One canvas, one tattoo? {\an1}- That just got a lot harder. - With everything that's been going on, collaboration is the furthest  thing from my mind. {\an8}It's like bad sushi on a Tuesday. {\an8}You just don't want it. - Now, how your team works together is completely up to you, but know this. You will win as a team, or you will lose as a team. - Oh. {\an1}- We are asking you to collaborate. Who tattoos is your business. If you all tattoo, if one of you tattoos for the team, but you will sink or swim as a team on that tattoo. - Yeah. - We have to work together. - Yeah. - One well-oiled machine. - The word of the day is creativity. {\an1}That's what we're looking for. Something unique, something that's gonna blow everybody else out of the water. {\an1}- Creativity. We got that. - I know. - This is your first chance to secure safety for your region. Fail to stand united, and one of you could be going home. - We can't afford that. {\an1} We need to win that safety, {\an8}'cause right now, we only have three members on our team. So we need to make sure  we nail this tattoo, 'cause we've got to get daddy to the finale, baby. - You have six hours to show your creativity with a team collaboration tattoo. Go get set up, and we'll send in your canvases. Good luck. - All right. Let's do it. - Let's go. [indistinct chatter] {\an8}- Part of being creative in this challenge {\an8}is gonna be listening to everybody's ideas {\an1} and working together as a team and putting the best idea forward. - I already have designs made up that nobody's seen. Like this guy right here. - That's cool. - That's cool. - That's cool. - Laid it all out. - With five of us, it's gonna be tough to all get our hands on it. - If I did the line work, it would probably benefit better. - I want to do the color. - I have nothing to prove at this moment. Having just two minds  working on something {\an1} is better than having five. {\an8}So if the boys can handle it, let them handle it. - I think something that screams cartoon, something that tells a scene would be awesome. {\an8}Being nominated for the bottom, especially by a team member, it just still feels like digging yourself out of a hole. This is one of my favorite drawings. I've been dying to do it, and I've got a [bleep] ton of ideas. This is my first one. - Well, I feel like it needs to have {\an1}some play with the background. - Yes, absolutely. - I'm thinking more of sort of, like, surrealist, like, getting [bleep] weird. {\an1}- I love stuff like that. - A face, and there is a door in the cheek, and something was coming out of it. {\an1}- I like where we're going. - Yeah, it's weird. - I want to support everyone else in what they do well. I see something like that, and what is that? Like, a pelican, a heron? What's that one over there of yours? - It's a heron, yeah. - Exactly. I like the shapes and things that are happening in that. - I have that design all ready to go. - When it comes to you, seeing your work, crystals. - We can do some crystals. - Geodes. {\an1}- I don't think that crystals go with a heron. {\an1}That doesn't make sense to me. - I don't see an issue with that. - I don't--I don't know why, but when I think of this bird in particular, though, it just-- I guess I'd have to see it. - I think--right. {\an7}- I know that Frank is kind of automatically the team leader-- he's been here before--but  Frank, why won't you listen? Why? - Ca-caw! ♪ ♪ [rock music] {\an8} ♪ ♪ - Okay, artists, you have six hours to tattoo, and your time starts now. - All right, guys. - Okay, let's do this. - In the first part of this tattoo marathon, each team can all tattoo, one of them can tattoo. It'll be as they see fit. - Dig it. {\an8}- Having this many different cooks in the kitchen {\an8}could either be the amazing meal of a lifetime, or it could be the worst thing you've ever tasted. - Kaboom. - There it is. - All right, here we go. [rock music] ♪ ♪ {\an3}- So, Jason, you're doing everything? {\an1}- No, I wish. Jordy and Patrick are gonna work on color. Money Mike is going to-- I actually have no idea. - You're gonna supervise, dude. - Whatever he-- whatever he wants to do. - Perception of our team is that me and Jordy  are just, like, the step-kids  left on the steps. {\an8}As long as I can keep getting to the next challenge, {\an8} I really don't care. ♪ ♪ {\an1}- Holy black, Batman. {\an3}- You know, dude? {\an1}- Just got to make sure all the black is solid like that. - That's the goal. - We might be down a team  member here, but that could work to our advantage, 'cause now we only have  three artists, three opinions,  where the other teams, {\an8}there might be too many cooks in the kitchen. ♪ ♪ - Three hours left, everybody. Three hours. ♪ ♪ - You guys, I'm having so much fun right now. ♪ ♪ - Make sure that we, like, punch that saturation in there. - No, I don't--I don't want to go too dark down there. Trust me, man. Trust me. I know what I'm doing. - I like a dark value, just 'cause it'll make everything else much brighter up top. I'm second-guessing what we've done, and it's stressing me out. Were we creative enough? Did we really show ourselves as artists collectively? We need this win. We can't afford to lose anybody on our team. ♪ ♪ [tattoo machine buzzing] - I'm slow, but I'm not that slow. - It's not gonna be done in time. He's making it beautiful with all of the blending, but it doesn't need that much blending. - Like, if we blend too much, then it's gonna {\an1}not have as much of a punch. He's going slow. Like, really slow. {\an8}Like, I would've been done with this tattoo by now. {\an1}- Let me do it then. I'm not worried about time. {\an1}Let me just do it.

You're gonna blend a little bit of grey out that way, and a little grey up, and then leave a highway, that's it. Yeah. Patrick's got me worried. I'm gonna tag-team  this tattoo. {\an8}I want to make sure that we get {\an8}all the rest of the colors in there. - Dude, knock the sun out. {\an1}- I'm almost done with the sun. ♪ ♪ - You know, like, if you're ever in the hospital, and there's that doctor that just comes by and asks you, like, you know, to wiggle your fingers, {\an1}and then he, like, walks out without really doing anything {\an1}and still makes like 300 bucks? - Is that you right now? - Yeah. - It's like these moments when you actually realize that less of a team is more-- is--is better, 'cause there's not so many pains. - Yeah. [laughs] {\an1}- Five, four, three, two, one. That's it, machines down. Time is up. No more ink. - That's it. - Great. - Hell, yeah. - All right, dude. You made it. - Looks like a big sticker.

South, let's have a look. - Man, the way this tattoo came out is super smooth. The black saturation  is really nice. I really like the soft details you put in the hat with this light wash  underlines. - See the way that this tattoo looks glossy? When it comes to color,  that's the look. It's beautiful, man. It's a nice, strong tattoo. - Thank you, thank you. ♪ ♪ {\an1}- West, let's see what you did. ♪ ♪ - I love this drawing. The line work in this is thin,  but it works for the design. It keeps it very tight,  but the color in this, you do go with  a few shades too many in such a little space. If you just take that one shade of green and you pound it in there, this tattoo  would jump that much brighter. For something this small,  a little less HD {\an1}would take you a lot further. ♪ ♪ - East, you're up. - All right. ♪ ♪ - Guys, I think you have a really creative take here. - I love the clean line work,  heavy, solid black, and keeping it really simple and bold. I mean, this thing is legible and bulletproof. - It's not something that  I've seen a million times. I commend you guys  for taking a swing. You swung in the right direction. - Thank you. - Thanks. ♪ ♪ - Midwest, you're next. ♪ ♪ Really creative design. This beautiful crane  is cracked in half, and it's revealing  a geode inside. It has this feminine  quality to it, but it has  this rough interior. So symbolically,  I see a lot in this. - As a design and as a composition, I love the shape of it. You really get the light  shining on the geode, and you really get  the depth in there. It's super cool. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. ♪ ♪ - All right, guys, time to determine which team had the best tattoo of the day. - I really love the South. The way that color's in,  the way it looks, and the glossiness. - On creativity day? - The thing that I like about creativity is that these guys are all, like, angry and "grr," so now they did, like, {\an3}the little chillin' angry penguin. [laughter] So it's like... I also see the humor in it. - Well, we're talking about out-of-the-box creativity {\an1}that we have never seen before. - With the East, that's the tattoo {\an1} that I want 20 years from now. It's still gonna be tough,  still gonna be strong, still gonna be cool. This is the most timeless tattoo of the day, for sure. - And I love what the Midwest did. I love seeing stuff that I could never possibly imagine. That, to me, is what's exciting in terms of creativity, and for that reason, I'm voting Midwest. - For application, I'm gonna still stick with the South. {\an8} ♪ ♪ - [whistles] Man. {\an1}For this particular challenge, my vote is for the Midwest. - Whoa. - Judges have decided.

But I do want to [bleep] with the South a little bit. {\an1}- I think that would benefit the both of us. {\an1}You help us out, it gets rid of some of the South, {\an1}some of their top players might trickle away. - Anything I can do to make sure that Jason has a rough day is usually a good idea to me. ♪ ♪ - Welcome to the second round of the tattoo marathon. {\an1}- Let's do it. - Midwest, you won best tattoo of the day in the first round and are safe from elimination this week. {\an3}- Goddamn right. {\an1}- Your team will not tattoo. - Yes. - For the rest of you, {\an1}you will have one more chance {\an1}to secure your team's safety. - We got this. - Let's do it. We were so close last time. - So close. - Once again, you must have a solid strategy and trust in your team, because today, you must... tag-team tattoo. - Ugh. - Oh, my... - As a team, you will create one tattoo for one human canvas. Two artists from your team must tattoo the same canvas at the same time. - What the [bleep]? - Shit, man. - Switching artists every hour. - That means we all gotta get on it. - Tag team tattoos  can be challenging. You've got people wiping  at different times. {\an8}You've got people pulling lines at different times. {\an1} You're in each other's space. But now at least Hiram can  stop tattooing after an hour. - Ugh, it's harder than you think. - You can tattoo any style or subject... {\an3}- Yes! - But once again, the tattoo must prove your creativity. - Gotta kill it. - We can do that. - We're looking for a solid tattoo that looks like one person did it.

I mean, I love tattooing snakes. - I love it. - What about the West? {\an1}- First round, they didn't have Raul {\an1}or Arlene or Angel. {\an1}I wonder where they're gonna play into this tattoo. - Yeah. - Yeah. {\an1}- I figured you guys-- {\an1}you guys cool to do black and grey today? - Black and grey today. - That sounds good. {\an1}- Cool. So I drew this up. {\an1}She's pretty cool. {\an8}Today I'm taking the reins on the tattoo. {\an1}Work to our strengths a little bit. {\an1}- Yeah. I'd say, definitely, I should be on shading, not lining. {\an1}- The crazy heart, I can handle that, because I drew it. - Cool. - I'm really curious what they're gonna draw over there. You know, the South team, I don't know how they're gonna do, having to both be on one canvas. - It's gonna be a power struggle. - Oh, yeah. - So what if I told you that I have a way for us to speed up time and still keep consistency? - Let's hear it. - Two artists, same time, on the same canvas. One artist can stretch and wipe, the other one can tattoo. - Holy shit. - Shit. - Okay, listen. We don't want no other team to find out. {\an3}- Now, here's a good question. {\an1}Are we gonna help people today, or are we gonna [bleep] with people today? - Yeah, just [bleep] with the South a little bit. - Yeah. - Help the East. - You okay with that? - I'm way down. ♪ ♪ - Try and take some deep breaths, all right? - This canvas can't make it  through the tattoo, man, we turning in an unfinished tattoo. - Gripping somebody like that to hold them down while you tattoo them is not a strategy.

Your blacks are so purposeful  around your edges, and then your umbrella  and your dress are in the same tone,  so it makes it look like those two items  are washed out, and everything else  was put in with heavy purpose.

Please have a seat. - All right. {\an8} ♪ ♪ - That means, South and East, all of you are up for elimination. - Here we go again. - All right. - You'll have one last chance to prove your creativity by facing off against each other. - Oh, my God. - Damn it. - But this time, the power is in the hands of your competition. ♪ ♪ Midwest, you will assign the style that everyone must tattoo in the face-off. And West, you'll assign the subject. - Oh, damn! - Oh, shit. - Oh, no. - [bleep] this. {\an8}- What do you think? {\an7}- That's what I was thinking. - Midwest, what style must they tattoo? - We decided that they're going to tattoo American traditional. ♪ ♪ - West, what subject must they tattoo? - Full-bodied fairies. - Bastards. - All right. - Full-bodied American traditional fairies, and this face-off is set. Tomorrow you'll have six hours to tattoo, and based on your work, one of you will be packing your machines. Good luck. ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - You guys can use whatever you guys need to use, as long as you're not [bleep] going home, okay? - Deal. - All right? ♪ ♪ - Let's tat some fairies.

Let's do this. ♪ ♪ - Go big or go home, right? - Yep. {\an7}- Final round of the marathon, East and the South, every man for himself. They have to tattoo {\an1}American traditional fairies. - You good? - I think I'm ready. [sighs] [dramatic music] - Basically,  we're looking at pinups, and traditionally in this competition, pinups are hard. ♪ ♪ The saving grace on that is that fairies  are mythological creatures. If you do a more standard  looking pinup with wings, we're gonna get you on  proportion and anatomy, but if you go a little wild with it, it's up for debate. - I would wear this. I've never seen anything like it. ♪ ♪ - The Midwest definitely  threw me a bone here. This is what I do at home every day, so I need to make sure  I kill it. Simple, clean,  doing what I do best, {\an8}but also giving myself enough time to work with my team. ♪ ♪ - Have you always been into some form of art? - I painted for about a decade, but I've always loved tattoos. I've collected tattoos since I was a teenager. I had a lot of issues being comfortable in my body, and for me, like, tattooing was just like, well, let me just, like, throw beautiful things all over myself. {\an8}Coming off the past couple days {\an8}working with my teammates, I feel really positive  for the first time, And I think that I can  use that to my advantage and do a great tattoo. - I'm looking for your black. It's packed solid as [bleep]. {\an8}- We have our own {\an8}American traditional fairy on our team, {\an1} and his name is Jimmy Snaz. - How you doing? - He's sprinkling his knowledge on us, and we'll be fine. Think she's a bad bitch? - Mm-hmm. - I'm trying to make you proud. I'm on your team. I can't just do your style and shit. - [laughs] {\an3}- Here he is. Just like when you have a beautiful, sunny day, and then just out of nowhere, a [bleep] storm comes. {\an1}- How'd you have any friends in school? - I didn't have any friends in school. - Oh, that makes sense. - Yeah. {\an1}- All right. {\an1}- Three hours to go, people. {\an1}Three more hours of tattooing. - I'm kind of pissed off about the last challenge. I felt like that our tattoo was the most creative, so with this design, it's basically like a big [bleep] you. - You did get away with not having to draw hands or feet. - Yeah, he got away with it, for sure. {\an8}- I'm doing a four-tittied cock horse fairy. {\an1} The bottom's gonna be a horse, the middle's  gonna be a woman, and the top's  gonna be a rooster. I'm putting an extra set of breasts on this tattoo because I saw the anatomical issues with Jimmy's. So I figure I'm just gonna  double up the challenge and make sure that I hit it better than he did. ♪ ♪ [tattoo machine buzzing] - Like, I was having issues with the hair. I wanted to make her a little more Hispanic. - She's beautiful. [tattoo machine buzzing] {\an7}- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Just trying to hit the challenge, that's all. No more, no less. {\an8}This is probably one of the biggest opportunities {\an8}in my career that I've had. I'm tattooing for my life  in this competition. To have all that weighing  on my mind right now, it feels like a vice grip is on my head. {\an8}- Yeah? - It's like a pinup in a blender. [laughter] - Final hour, guys. Final hour tattooing. ♪ ♪ - It's always the end that hurts the worst. - I know. My canvas's skin is starting to welt up. You've got, like, little top layers of skin just kind of peeling off. If you're from the South,  a welt would be when your mama busts your ass with a hickory. This is becoming  a nightmare for me. - How you doing, buddy? {\an8}I have too much to lose. {\an8}My name is on the line, my family. {\an8}I'll be damned if I'm gonna go home on this [bleep] tattoo. ♪ ♪ {\an1}- Five, four, three, two, one. Time is up. No more ink. - Your line work is amazing. Just watching you draw those lines so steady and bold.

[laughs] - Do you think any one of my team's in the bottom? - I mean, I'd say K, just because I don't think it's American traditional. It's definitely more illustrative. If the challenge is American traditional, and everybody's looks American traditional but one... - Right. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - Today the South and the East had to face off against each other, tattooing an American traditional fairy. {\an1}Based on your work, one of you will be packing your machines. - Here we go. {\an1}- East, let's start with you. Jessa. ♪ ♪ - It is a very traditional style of illustration. I like that it has a lot  of rich contrast. It has a punch to it. - I like the style of hair that you do here. Coloring this in black, it gives it a nice  graphic feel and shape. But if you're gonna use a bright red, why not use bright green  and bright yellow? If you're doing  American traditional, a muted color palette  isn't really {\an1}the classic way of doing it. ♪ ♪ - Jimmy. - All right. {\an3}- Go, Jimmy. - I really like the illustration. I love the features  you put on her {\an1} to give her a fairy-esque look with the ears  and the real straight nose. The line work  throughout this thing {\an1}is super clean, super sharp. - What really shines is the amount of open skin. Everything in the foreground  is lit; it's beautiful. Remember that traditional tattoos were done when 40 people were waiting in a line. It was about moving fast and efficient. {\an1}You definitely deliver here. It's a good job. - Thank you. {\an1}- If he dropped the ball, I'd be really surprised. - Yeah, absolutely. - First good critique. - K. ♪ ♪ {\an1}- I do see a big turn in you. You're definitely  tattooing a lot better than where you started  with us. - Yeah, the past couple days,  just being able to make tattoos with my team was really great. - Lot of great color saturation in here, but this outline  is super thin. - And she has a little bit  of a flat face. But you show a lot more promise in being solid and being clean. - Thank you. - [whispers] Good job. - [bleep]. - It's getting ready to get real. - South, you're up. ♪ ♪ Money Mike. Anatomically, this thing is very, very strange. Arms don't grow from here. - It's kind of weird  what's exactly going on with the anatomy. She's twisting up  a little bit. Your outlines, we can see the drag lines of each needle, as opposed to being  one solid line. Also, the application  of that green, not very smooth. You went over it  a little bit too much. That's why you're getting that rough texture. ♪ ♪ - Patrick. ♪ ♪ - The illustration, I like it. The anatomy of the girl  looks nice, sitting on the moon  looks nice, but it does get rough  in a lot of areas. The lines in the hair  look rough. The line by her neck  is really, really beat. A lot of problems here  with trauma with the skin. - I--I'll be honest, man, I've never had that issue like this before. {\an1}It just was not as good skin as I thought it was gonna be. - It's pretty jacked. - Jordy. ♪ ♪ I really love the position of this pinup, but the face got away  a little bit. It just doesn't look  proportionately right. - It's pretty wild looking, but you do pull off a very traditional feel, and you do pull off  a lot of solid saturation. {\an1}Overall, it's a clean tattoo. ♪ ♪ - Jason. ♪ ♪ We did say creativity. {\an1}- Four-tittied chicken goat. [laughter] - Just weird and funky, and it looks like you had a fun time with this. - Good one-pass line, solid black whip, solid color. It's a strong tattoo. - Thanks. - High risk, high reward. {\an1}- I think it looked cool. I liked it. ♪ ♪ - All right, judges, it is time to determine who's going home. {\an3}- I would say that my bottom picks all live in the South. - So can we all agree that the East is safe? - I do. ♪ ♪ Mike and Patrick. That's the big battle right there. - You know, we went for traditional {\an1}because it shows fundamentals. {\an1}Patrick's tattoo, it's beat. - It's just so overworked. - I will--I will disagree with it being overworked. - Go ahead. - Now, there's trauma areas, but I don't think the whole tattoo's overworked. - There's way less damage in Mike's, but it's fundamentally flawed at the design table. {\an8}- Drawing for drawing, {\an8} I'd rather have Patrick's  girl on the moon. {\an8} - Just too beat, man. ♪ ♪ My vote to go home is for Patrick. ♪ ♪ - Regrettably, Patrick. - The judges have decided. Patrick, you do not have what it takes to be Ink Master. - This competition has been a roller-coaster for you, man. You did some really killer work in here, and you should be proud of that, so head up. - I came in here with my head held high, and I'm gonna walk out with my head held high. - Please pack your machines and close shop. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - I'm not gonna go cry in my pillow. {\an1} I'm not gonna stop tattooing. I'm gonna go back home  and just get better. Hell or high water, I'll be back, and I promise,  when I come back, there'll be a whole nother storm to deal with. ♪ ♪ announcer: On the next episode  of "Ink Master"... - We need to take every advantage that we can get. With the East, we have  an eight-person alliance. - Oh, my God. {\an1}- Damn, how you feeling, Bob? - I don't understand what's going on. I have a higher set of standards that I set for myself. It just crushes me. Ugh. - Welcome to the jungle. {\an1}- I don't know what it is, bro. - Shit's just spilling out. - That's bullshit. - When you see it's not going well, don't continue on.
