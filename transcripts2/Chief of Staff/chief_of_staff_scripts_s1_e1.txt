 HUNGER STRIKE, 27TH DAY BUGANG ELECTRONICS LABOR UNION And use all the aforementioned rules to turn ideals into reality. These are my beliefs as chief of staff. Sir. At the National Assembly, there are 300 assemblymen and 2,700 staffers who assist them. Hello there, Ms. Kang. Good morning. Let's go in. This stop is National Assembly Station. They're like the assemblymen's employees whose duties deal with political matters. The number of contract workers -Chiefs of staff assist assemblymen -makes up 17.7 percent.

 -and draw up policies and bills. -Only 3.9 percent... I think "solution" will sound gentler than "breakthrough." -"Solution." I see. -Yes, it'll sound better. Okay, got it. -Thanks. -We also write speeches for various events and press releases. Hello. -Get him... -Listening to complaints from various constituencies and resolving them is also our job. -Get him out right now! -No, don't do this! Our job has its own challenges, of course. Say something! -Wait. -Go get him! We have to go that way. Are you blind or what? Jeez, seriously. You idiot. -Where's Tae-jun? -Sir... -Come back here. -I can't get into the details, but it's just like any other job. I see. Then what's it like during election seasons? A year ago, Assemblyman Song Hui-seop, whom you're currently assisting, and Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong competed quite fiercely for the floor leader role. There was Assemblywoman Kang Seon-yeong, who is supported by the ruling party,  as Assemblyman Jo's running mate back then too. Even if I get all the neutral votes, it'll be a tie. If I lose even a single vote, I'll have no chance at all. No. One vote will be enough. I guess you worked on getting the neutral votes over the weekend. Too bad it won't work. I'm impressed that he's made it this far. If it hadn't been for you, Mr. Song wouldn't even have been nominated. You can cheer me up later, Ms. Kang. It isn't over yet, you know. Just one vote will be enough? Whose vote? The party's ethics commissioner, Mr. Lee Jang-su. Article 22 of the party's Code of Ethical Conduct. DUI, bribery, giving or receiving illicit political funds, and the abuse of power. Anyone who's been accused of such conduct may be suspended. That's right. Eleven members of the Assembly have been accused. Nine of them are voting for Mr. Jo. If their rights are suspended, it means they won't be able to vote. -That's correct, sir. -That's right. If that happens, I'll win by one vote. Right? My gosh, you rock. -I won! -Song Hui-seop! -I won! -Song Hui-seop! FLOOR LEADER ELECTION Then last but not least, may I ask you what your dreams are? -My dreams? -Yes. EPISODE 1 Members of the ruling Daehan Party are having conflicting opinions regarding the leadership system of the party leader, who will be elected in February. At the moment, the Daehan Party's leader position is vacant. There will be discussions about it at the party's general meeting today, but there will be disagreements between Assemblyman Song Hui-seop, the floor leader, and the higher members. DAEHAN PARTY -Oh, you're here. -Yes, sir. Don't worry about a thing. There's nothing to worry about. -I'll see you in a bit, sir. -All right. The poll regarding the Daehan Party's leadership election, which was conducted yesterday, revealed that Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong was still the most-supported candidate. Assemblyman Jo outdid the others in all three criteria, which include eligibility for the position, approval rating, and the likelihood of winning. Jeez. Serving as the floor leader didn't even help me for a full year. These people keep switching sides like reeds blowing in the wind. Dear me. I'm okay. Hey, you're here. Oh, you were home. What is that? I thought you'd like this. -Shall we have some? -Sounds good. CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT KANG SEON-YEONG PROBLEMS REGARDING BUGANG ELECTRONICS' LAYOFF Did the interview go well? Yes. Thanks. I didn't even do much. I just put them in touch with you. Don't say that. That's everything. Congratulations. You're famous now. This is just the beginning. You need to become more famous. You deserve it. Here. Oh, here? I'm running late. I can't find the tie you got me. Which one? This one? You want to wear this today? The new town development bill that allows the purchase of landfill sites is causing quite a stir. Today, Assemblyman Jo Gap-yeong is in the studio -to tell us the details  -Thanks. about some of the issues that the bill may pose. -Hello. -Hello. Many people are immensely interested in the new town development bill. What are your thoughts on it? Many have been wanting and waiting for... Let's go out for breakfast. Mr. Song has a breakfast meeting. -A breakfast meeting? -With the Samil Association. It's a social gathering of former four-term assemblymen. Do you have to go there? It's an important gathering, so I should accompany him. -But still... -What? What can I do? ASSEMBLYMAN JO GAP-YEONG Yes, sir. -I should head out now. -What? Did something happen? I just need to get going. I'll call you. ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG SEON-YEONG Election fraud allegations have been made against  Assemblyman Song during the floor leader election... Sir. We will now go live to the site of the press conference. What the heck have you been up to? You're my head chief of staff. How could you let this happen? We'll begin the press conference calling for Floor Leader Song Hui-seop's resignation. At the moment, we do not have a party leader, and Song Hui-seop, the floor leader, is abusing his power and authority to arbitrarily postpone the national convention. And using the nomination rights, he is trying to disunite the party. In addition, there are allegations that he used illegal means to be elected floor leader. It is questionable whether he is qualified as the... She can't be doing this alone. Who's behind her? ASSEMBLYMAN JO GAP-YEONG Yes, sir. It's Mr. Jo Gap-yeong. Jo Gap-yeong? Jeez, that prick. He lost the election. Why can't he just shut up and stay out of it? Does that petty man have no shame or what? Jeez, that vindictive bastard. What is this mess? He's causing internal strife using a first-term member. You should've taken better care of things. What the hell have you been doing? You made me look bad. Gosh, you got it on my face. Watch it. My apologies, sir. Jo Gap-yeong has ties to the prosecution. If they start digging, things will get even worse. If he becomes the leader of the party, all of us will be screwed. Tae-jun. We should... go to the Blue House together. We can't be bogged down here. Sir. Please don't be too concerned. What you're worrying about won't happen. Yes, it shouldn't happen. It's me. Send the material to the prosecution. You said Assemblyman Song is creating a divide within the party. Could you provide a further explanation? At the moment, members who want the convention to take place soon and those who don't are locking horns with each other. As the floor leader, Assemblyman Song is remaining silent without making any effort to resolve the tension in an attempt to create a rift. So what is Assemblyman Song doing to postpone the convention? He's insisting that the convention should be postponed until we find a new data firm, as the one we've been working with for leadership elections isn't properly equipped. However, we can't accept his claim. What the heck is going on? I haven't seen that face in a long time. What card does Mr. Jo have? I have no idea either. He just told me to get the word out, so I rushed to hold the press conference. You weren't involved in any of it, right? It all depends. If Assemblyman Song continues to oversee... We'll have another press conference later. I'm not sure what it'll be about, but be ready. -I'll call you. -Wait! -Seon-yeong! -Ms. Kang. The reporters are coming. You should leave. This way, please. Then I'll wait for your call, Ms. Kang. -Yes, Mr. Jang. -Who's in the office now? It's just me and Ms. No. How did this happen? I'm looking into it. Where's Mr. Kim? He's on his way back from the Board of Audit and Inspection. Which reporters are covering Mr. Jo at the moment? Kang Seung-wan at KTN, Lee Jae-seok from International Daily, and Kim Won-ho from Dodam Daily. Contact them when Mr. Kim gets back. -Where's his office? -Hold on. Room 605. Reporters are flocking to our office now. Just play dumb -and give them a doctored schedule. -Okay, sir. Ms. No, send me Mr. Song's schedule. Sure. 11 A.M. NGO MEETING I guess Assemblyman Song isn't here yet. When will he be here? Mr. Jang isn't answering either. -Where is he? -Did you see the press conference? Have you contacted him? He's not back from his breakfast meeting yet. He may not know the situation. -Oh, please. Don't lie to us. -Will he be attending the council meeting? I'm sorry. I don't know anything. Samcheong-dong. He's there now! -Samcheong-dong? -Samcheong-dong! JANG TAE-JUN "Head Chief of Staff Jang Tae-jun faithfully assists the floor leader of the ruling party, Assemblyman Song Hui-seop, in all of his legislative activities. In addition, he has earned his nickname, Autumn Viper, by scoring a major scoop during every state administration inspection." Jeez. "His specialties include thorough data analysis and policy development. He is said to be the number one candidate to be nominated for next year's..." Gosh, do they think the legislative election is a joke? That obnoxious viper. He's trying so hard to climb up the ladder. You startled me. Don't sneak in like that, okay? You're like a real snake, slithering in here noiselessly like that. Where's Mr. Jo? Why are you looking for him? You can talk to me. It's not something I can talk to you about. You want to talk directly to the assemblymen now? You must think you're quite the big shot. I don't know what kind of joke this is, but you'd better cut it out. A joke? Did you come all the way here thinking we were joking around? You must really be hiding something, judging by how you're roaming around so desperately like this. What's wrong? Did you take care of some dirty stuff when you got him elected the floor leader? -Watch what you say. -Why are you being so serious? Everyone knows we take care of the dirty stuff for the assemblymen. Are you trying to act like you're different or what? My gosh, you're scary. You guys should be careful. You never know when this viper might bite. Pass me the documents from earlier. Be careful before you actually get bitten. What's his problem? Hey, you're just a chief of staff. You can't become an assemblyman. But Jang Tae-jun has a handsome face and a great career history. It's more than possible for him. Don't you agree? Yes. You little punk. Then what about me? -Do you really think you're fit for it? -You darn punk. -What... -Go work for Jang Tae-jun. You're saying that again. Hey, Da-jeong. -Is no one here? -No. What about Tae-jun? He won't answer my calls. I don't know. I knew the floor leader's office would be different. The fridge is completely packed. This isn't a convenience store. Drink your own beverages. You're always doing this. Your name means "kindness," but you're not kind at all. Is that why your last name is "No"? Da-jeong, there's... There's a cockroach over there! -A cockroach! -Where? Darn it. Hey, Tae-jun. -Just a second. -I'm busy. Come on. Just give me three minutes. I'm busy too. Where's Ms. Kang? Don't look for her. She can't help you. She's in a pretty bad pickle herself. Why? Mr. Jo is trying to kick her out and appoint someone else as the spokesperson. Who? Kim Mi-jin, the announcer at KTN. You're becoming more handsome as time goes by. That's nonsense. Ms. Kang. Say hello. You know her, right? She's Kim Mi-jin. Yes, I know her well. It's nice to see you, Ms. Kang. Long time no see. Yes, it's been a while. Isn't it obvious? He's trying to get elected as the floor leader with the help of the press. He's going to attend this afternoon's press conference so he can look good. She knows a lot. Isn't this a press conference meeting? What's Ms. Kim doing here? Oh, about the press conference... I thought maybe we could do it in the form of an interview, with me appearing on the show that Ms. Kim is hosting. But wouldn't it be better for Ms. Kang to give an official speech in the press room? Appearing on a TV show will attract a lot more attention, and it's better in many ways. No one watches the National Assembly Television. Don't you agree? You're going to do the interview yourself? He won't do it himself. If that's what he had in mind, he wouldn't have asked her to talk to the press this morning. He needs someone to take the bullet in case things go wrong. You'll do a much better job than me. And you look great on camera. I don't have enough time to prepare for the interview. Don't worry. I'm already in the process of writing the script. -I'll look forward to it. -Of course, sir. I guess you really can't trust anyone when it comes to politics. Ms. Kang worked so hard to make Mr. Jo seem like a suitable floor leader. How can he betray her like this? Don't ever be like that in the future. Ms. Kang won't be able to fight back because she's so nice. I'm worried about her. FATHER By the way, what did you do last night? -You weren't even home. -You came to my place? My wife kept nagging, so I thought we could have a drink. You're like a stray cat. Why are you so busy at night? Something's fishy. Do you really not know what Mr. Jo has on you guys? No, I don't. That means it's something Mr. Song did himself. You must be really anxious. Are you having fun? Yes, I read the interview. You came out nicely. Not as good as me though. But do you really want to run for office even after seeing what I went through? I spent every single penny I had just so I could get that darn badge. And I'm still paying back my interest. It's not like you're rich, and you have no powerful connections. The least you can do as my friend is support me. Hey. Eat that and cheer up. You're not like me, so you'll make it. At least one of us should get to wear that badge. You can do it, Tae-jun! You've lost touch. Things must be hard these days. Was it your idea to use me as cannon fodder? What are you talking about? It's what you used to do as an attorney back when you hosted the show. You gladly let me take over, but our ratings are really poor these days. It'd be nice if you could help out as a former host. Be well prepared for the interview. My questions will be a bit sensitive. You're no longer in your prime, so you might not be as quick as you used to be. I'm just saying this out of concern, so don't be too offended. Do you want to get into politics? Or do you just want to beat me? Because you're following in my footsteps. It's both. I want to become like you. Have you looked into why your ratings have been declining? I heard it's the broadcast's main current affairs program, so I had high expectations. But it was no different from the news I saw this morning and the articles I read on my phone. It was exactly the same. I know you have scripts. But you're hosting the show with your name on the line. Aren't you embarrassed to read the script exactly as it is? And as the host of a current affairs program, you should know political terms. You should work on yourself before you receive someone else's help. Don't try to imitate me. Mr. Jo! The prosecution is on the move. My goodness. I bet taking Song Hui-seop's right-hand man will hurt him. Yes, it serves him right. The Daehan Party held an urgent press conference today. Its insistence on the resignation of their floor leader, caused a huge uproar, making the members of the party yell at and make rude comments about each other. We will hear about the details from Assemblywoman Kang Seon-yeong, the spokesperson of the Daehan Party, at 8:00 p.m. tonight on Kim Mi-jin's Current Affairs. Mr. Jo is planning to hold a press conference after the show. He might run for floor leader. Well, that's going to be very fancy. DETECTIVE LEE Hey. Okay. I need to go somewhere. Hello. May I help you? Hello, I'm Han Do-gyeong, and I'm here for the internship interview. Tae-jun, the prosecution started a search and seizure. Not just your current house but the one in your hometown, too. Sir. The prosecution is apparently searching Jang Tae-jun's house. Darn it. Tae-jun isn't like himself these days. I don't know why he's so distracted. If you don't stay alert, you end up harming yourself. Darn it. Mr. Song set the date himself? Yes, he asked me to come today. No one knows when he'll come. You can either wait or leave your number. No, I'll just wait here. By the way, is this true? ASSEMBLYMAN SONG SUSPECTED OF USING ILLEGAL MEANS I don't know. By the way, where is Mr. Jang going? Are you acquainted with him? No, not exactly. I just respect him. He's my role model. And I met him during the first round of my interview. Have you read this? "Doubt everything. Trust the situation, not the person. Don't show your weakness. Think and analyze at all times. Don't make choices you'll regret later on. And use all the aforementioned rules to turn ideals into reality." Isn't he so cool? Sure. Ms. Yun, I'll be at the secretariat to take care of the expenses. Okay. Thanks to my competent son, my house got invaded by the prosecution. PRESIDENT'S AWARD LIEUTENANT JANG TAE-JUN Gosh, that hurts. Damn it! What a joke. My gosh. Hey. You should go to the hospital. I'll clean up here. Why would I go to the hospital for this? I'll just apply some antiseptic on it. What are you up to these days? What made the prosecution barge in here? It's nothing. How can it be nothing? They made a mess of the house! Is this why you quit being a cop? So you can be a minion? I mean, seriously. You graduated the police university with honors. But for what? If your late mother saw you like this, do you think she'd have been happy? I'm relieved she never got to see this. Why are you bringing her up? Why? Are you embarrassed? You should know your place. You think you can become an assemblyman? Did you forget why Mom died? You wanted to run for office, so you spent all our money, including Mom's surgery fee... What? If you hate me so much, why did you even come here? Why don't we just cut ties? You come over in three years, and that's what you say? If it was easy to cut ties, we would've cut ties a long time ago. What did you say, you punk? -Hey. -What happened? I heard about the search and seizure. Word travels fast. If the prosecution is handling this, they'll try their best to hunt you down. Will you be okay? Just a second. Tae-jun, here's what you asked for. You should be worried about Mr. Jo, not me. He messed with the wrong guy. I'll call you later. Hey, Aunt. It's me. How have you been? Well, the thing is, Dad hurt his foot a little. Can you take him to the hospital? You know he never listens to me. Please do me a favor. SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY Gosh, thank you. I didn't know they'd search your father's place. They're trying to pressure me. What do you plan to do? It seems like they want to meet, so I should grant them their wish. Thanks. I'll call you. Hello. May I help you? I'm here to meet Prosecutor Seo. I'm Jang Tae-jun from Mr. Song's office. You didn't have to come here yourself. We would've come for you. I got bored of waiting. You're quite brave for a chief of staff. Is it because you think Mr. Song has your back? Mr. Jang, you're being investigated for bribery. You mean you have suspicions. Who's the informant? The informant? We're still investigating, so I can't tell you that. The prosecution carried out a search and seizure based on suspicions and a tip-off? This is an urgent case, and you could've tried to destroy evidence. You were a cop. You know how it works. Is that why you looked into my email, cell phone, and even my social media account? We just followed the procedure. You probably investigated everyone I called to find out who bribed me. Then I'm sure you also know who these numbers belong to. There are 35 journalists, 52 organization leaders, and 172 assemblymen and assemblywomen. You illegally investigated all these people without a warrant. And some of those numbers belong to chief prosecutors and Supreme Court justices. What illegal investigation? You investigated not only my phone calls and texts but theirs as well. How is this not illegal? Should I ask them if you asked for their approval? How do you think they'll react once they find out about this? -Mr. Jang. -Put everything back to normal. Then everything will go back to where it belongs. Have a good day. Have a good day, everyone. The prosecutor in charge and Jo Gap-yeong went to the same college, right? Yes, that's right. Jo Gap-yeong, that jerk, was trying to take away my right-hand man. When did you find out you were being investigated? It's been about a week. Why didn't you tell me? I was going to tell you once I took care of it. Who's the informant? We may have shut them up, but we need to find the informant to be safe. This is a crucial time for me. If you're not around... Don't worry. I'm the informant. Hey, it's me. Send the material to the prosecution. So you beat them to it and threw the bait first? They can't reuse their bait, so they won't be able to use the prosecution anymore. But you could've gotten hurt. If you want to catch a whale, you're bound to get hurt and break a few fishing rods. He's not a whale. He's just a small fish. Let's go have some rice soup. You didn't even eat breakfast. Let's eat together next time. I still need to take care of something. Okay, sure. Sir. Jo Gap-yeong, that little punk. How dare he mess with me? Thanks. -Have a good day. -Thank you. Okay, bye. Yes, he's still too good to throw away. Bye. ASSEMBLYWOMAN KANG Where are you going? The broadcasting station? Is it too much? No, it looks nice on you. You look great. My gosh. You always say that kind of stuff so easily. I'm serious. You look great. You really do. What's this? Seoul Continental Hotel. Mr. Jo is having a meeting there regarding the legislation. Will you be okay? I'll be fine. Just destroy Jo Gap-yeong. That will be enough. -Yes, Mr. Jang. -Hey. I'm sending over meeting materials and a bill. Compare it with similar foreign cases and analyze them. LANDFILL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW I'm taking a look at it right now, and I think there's a similar bill in Germany. But it's going to take some time to translate it. I'll send it to you once I'm done. Here you go. -Thank you. -Is there anything I can help you with? I'll do anything you ask. Can you speak German? No. Hey. -Where's Mr. Jang? -He's going to Mr. Jo's meeting. What's he planning to do? Da-jeong, coffee, please. She went to the secretariat. My gosh, why is she never at her desk? Sir. Would you like to drink this instead? -Who's this? -I'm Han Do-gyeong. You were there during the first round of my interview. Oh, right. Thank you. I thought he failed the interview. I didn't see his name on the list. Mr. Song asked him to come. Oh, really? -Give me the meeting materials. -Here. -Thank you. -Sure. Okay, then. As I explained earlier, the current bill calculated the total contamination level of our water, air, and soil. And by calculating the economic feasibility and preservability, it aims to keep a balance between environmental protection and development. And thus, it is an excellent bill that will provide a new standard -for environmental development. -I sent the email. MATERIAL REGARDING LANDFILL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW POLICY MEETING FOR LANDFILL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW LANDFILL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW IN GERMANY Thank you, everyone. Next, we will move onto... May I ask an additional question? No, sir! Time is up... Does this bill conflict in any kind of way with the Environmental Protection Bill that was passed in 2005? And I would like to hear your thoughts on the economic strain that will result if this bill were to be passed. Mr. Jo? We have already thoroughly reviewed everything. -Yes, then-- -That doesn't seem to be the case. This bill you're working on will be hard to apply in real life. Depending on the scope of its application, questions about neutrality will arise. Contamination levels will differ due to the characteristics of the environment. It'll also cause a dispute among those who have vested interests in certain facilities and areas where the bill doesn't apply. I would like your answer regarding this. What do you think you're doing? Why are you trying to ruin this? You really crossed the line back there. Mr. Song is a very lucky man. He has you as his chief of staff. Tae-jun. What do you say to working for me instead? There's no point staying on a ship that's about to sink soon. You'll just end up drowning. My goodness, sir. Now is not exactly the best time. So how about after the inspection? Thank you for the offer, but you're a bit too late. You should've made that offer before making a deal with the prosecution. What? I couldn't bring you your gift because I came here in a hurry. But it's getting wrapped right now. Prepare for the press release regarding Mr. Jo. Press release? Mr. Jang. What did he say? He asked me to prepare a press release. What press release? What press release? Sir. You should be careful. I may have shown you goodwill during the last election, but that won't happen again. I am very spiteful right now. Hey, Tae-jun. What... Hey, wait. Hey! Find out what it is. Yes, sir. Yes, I came downstairs. I'm on my way. Yes. I understand. It's Mr. Jo's secretary. I'll write the press release. Yes, right. Did you print out the material regarding Mr. Jo? One second. -Put everything together for me. -Do you have the statements? Yes, here. Hurry up. We have no time. This one too. Things look really serious. I think it is about Mr. Jo. -Send it to Dodam Daily too. -Yes. No. Yes, okay. I understand. Mr. Ju Gyeong-mun, the CEO of Hamyeong Constructions... As I told you before, delete everything. You have to delete everything. There is something going on between Mr. Jo and Mr. Ju. Look over the list of sponsors for Mr. Jo again. And find out if his office handed over any press releases. Did Mr. Jo's office tell you when they'll hand over the materials? -Not yet? -Da-jeong. How many contracts with Hamyeong? -I'm looking for them. -And the list of Mr. Ju's sponsors? -Yes, I'm working on it. -Okay. Yes, okay. Mr. Jang. Mr. Jo's office hasn't handed over any materials to KTN yet. It must be working. They'll find out soon enough that we have nothing. We can't fool them for long. We must find the real deal. -Where's the list of his sponsors? -It just came from the Election Committee. What about his subsidiaries? I'm putting them together. But we already looked into Mr. Ju's side during the preliminary election. Do you think we'll find anything? He said he didn't know him back then. There has to be a connection since they are still in touch. Let's dig up his donation list and find out. Yes, sir. Hello, sir. I am Han Do-gyeong, here for the internship interview. Han Do-gyeong? Didn't you drop him? Mr. Song personally wanted to see him. We need to have a meeting, so have him wait in the lounge. Yes, sir. To the meeting room, everyone. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. CONNECTION, DONATION -Right here. -Look at this one too. Yes. MR. JU DENIES GIVING MONEY TO ASSEMBLYMAN JO RECEIVED 30 MILLION WON FROM MR. JU? ILGANG INDUSTRY CEO JU GYEONG-MUN SPONSORS LIBRARY ESTABLISHMENT Okay, let's run a camera test. Did you get the material from Mr. Jo's office? Not yet. They haven't handed it over to the TV stations either. Ms. Kang, don't be nervous. I will lead you. Thank you. None of Mr. Ju's subsidiaries made a donation to him. Everything they reported to the Election Committee looks solid too. Maybe Mr. Jo and Mr. Ju really don't have a connection. -What is it? -Excuse me. I was wondering if this might be useful. TO MR. JU, FROM JO GAP-YEONG This is an autograph Mr. Ju received at Mr. Jo's publication party. It looks like they aren't strangers then. -Where did you get this? -Well... Mr. Ju was involved in establishing a library, and he donated this to them. There is no use in finding out their relationship now. That was published seven years ago. That's before Mr. Ju became the CEO of Hamyeong Constructions. And we can't conclude he donated money just because of this book. Well, great work finding it though. Is that so? RECORDS OF PASSION TO MR. JU, FROM JO GAP-YEONG Can you find the employee list for Ilgang Industry? Ilgang Industry closed down six years ago. Bring me the donation list for Mr. Jo from seven years ago. Find everyone from Ilgang Industry on the list, call them to check if they made a donation, and if the amount is right. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. What's your name? -I'm Han Do-gyeong. -Mr. Han. If you aren't busy, please give us a hand. Yes, sir. Hello. This is Assemblyman Song Hui-seop's office. -Did you work for Ilgang? -Are you Mr. Oh? -I'm calling about a donation. -You donated money to Assemblyman Jo. Did you work at Ilgang Industry seven years ago? -Yes, I see. Thank you. -Yes. Yes, you're right. -Are you Ms. Jang Ji-eun? -I see. -While you were with Ilgang Industry... -Seven years ago, did you... Hello. This is Assemblyman Song Hui-seop's office. I found someone. Director Lee Gi-su of Ilgang Industry donated five million won to him. Me too. Kim Won-jun of Ilgang Industry donated one million won. Mr. Jang. Lee Mal-nam donated 200,000 won. Mr. Jang, Ji Sang-ah, one million won. Ms. Won, 2.5 million. -Mr. Jang, I found another one. -Me too. -Ms. Lee, 1.4 million. -Ms. Seol, 2.2 million. LIST OF DONORS A total of 134 people from Ilgang Industry. It adds up to 147.5 million won. These donations weren't made personally. Their name was only used to help the organization donate money. It's illegal for a corporation or an organization to fund a politician, but this was seven years ago. The statute of limitations has expired. Now what? If they're still in touch, it means he gave him more funds that we don't know about. Send a fax to Mr. Jo's office in five minutes. Let's see how they react. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. Send me the reporters' numbers. -Check the assemblymen's list. -Yes, sir. -Did you check everything? -I'm on it. What? Are you here to apologize? Ta-da. "Assemblyman Song exposed for buying his place in office." What are you going to do? Let's see. What time is it? Goodness. You're too late. Hey, can you print -about 15 copies of the press release? -Yes, sir. Do you think such a rumor will do any damage? This is just the bait, man. This is the real deal. Ta-da. What do you think this is? Try to guess. This USB contains information on everything that you guys did. Do you smell that? Gosh, something smells really fishy, doesn't it? Your boss did a lot of bad things to become the floor leader of the party. You knew everything, didn't you? No. This... This was all your doing, right? You brat. You're so cheap. -Send the press release to the TV station. -Yes. I need a new tie. -This color doesn't suit me. -Yes. Hey, you should go prepare the counterstatement. -You have no time to be here. -You should give this another thought. I'm just worried about your safety. Goodness. I don't think you're in a position to worry about him. Position doesn't matter when worrying about someone who's in a shithole. Watch what you say. Hey, Tae-jun. If I gave you a chance, you should have taken it. I think there is a misunderstanding. This time, I'm giving you a chance, sir. Hey, Tae-jun! This is your last chance. Take it. Stop bluffing. What is this? What? A love letter? Goodness, unbelievable. What? What is it? What is it? Make your decision. You don't have much time. Send the press release to the reporters. You jerk! You arrogant jerk. How dare you threaten an incumbent assemblyman? What should I do, sir? What are you talking about? Hey. Put the National Assembly TV on the monitor. Yes. Please put NATV on the monitor. I have listened to the opinions of many different people regarding my running for the election to become the representative of my party. And today, after much thought, I decided -not to run for the election. -What? Although I will not be running, I will continue to work as a member in creating the conditions for our party to bring forth innovation, and continue to do my best on duty. Sir, why are you suddenly giving up on the election? -What is the reason? -Are you giving up -because of Assemblyman Song? -Can you say a word -to your supporters? -Why are you resigning? Why is he doing this? -What the heck? -Is this a joke? To some people, this may be good news. To others... What about our program? What do you think? Air the substitute program. Air the substitute program. Ms. Kang, let us go. Shall we? All your effort was for nothing. See you around. I worked harder than anyone else in this party to this day. From now on, I will work even harder... What is the role of art in our society? For a long time, art was regarded as something only for the rich and powerful. However, in this modern day, from the dishes we put on our food... That was a good blow. Great work. Are you all right? This? I'm fine. Great work. -Great work. -Great job. The doors are closing. What's with your lips? It's an honorable scar. It's pretty sexy. Thank you for your help today. No, I should thank you. I felt much better today thanks to you. Really? Do you know why the elevators in this building are great? Why? They don't have any security cameras. Thank you so much for today. The doors are opening. PROUD FLESH OINTMENT -Goodness, you should go now. -Yes. Go on. People will misunderstand us if they see this. Go inside. -Goodness, sure. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Yes, see you tomorrow. Man, those fools are sucking up to me. -What about Jo Gap-yeong's material on me? -They have been destroyed. I see. Goodness. I put in so much work over the past year. Who the hell is trying to mess everything up? Find out who gave the information to Jo Gap-yeong. Yes, sir. And... what should I do about him? Who? -What's your name? -I am Han Do-gyeong. We finally got someone talented. Do-gyeong, come to work starting tomorrow. Yes, thank you. Goodbye. Yes. Go inside. Thank you. See you tomorrow! Come in. It's about time you were introduced. I... Come in. -I'm late. -Goodness, hello. Come in. Hey, Mr. Jang. Hello. I am Jang Tae-jun. Gosh, I've only seen this on TV before. This is so cool. You're asking your intern to steal stuff now? Imagine the look on Song Hui-seop's face when he sees him at the audit. It means you give dangerous jobs to the laborers of a subcontractor. Your time is up. You must stop. Jo Gap-yeong, that dumb punk, came up with a smart move this time. We need to do something. You'll be bored during your long flight. You should read this on the plane. If I want something, I should take the necessary risks. Subtitle translation by Ja-won Lee
