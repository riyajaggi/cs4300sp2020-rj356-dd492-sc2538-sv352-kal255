 The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007â€“2011): Season 3, Episode 3 - The Mad Woman in the Attic: Part 1 - full transcript 
 In 2059 a boy named Adam discovers an elderly woman in the attic of Sarah Jane's old house. It is Rani, who recalls an incident fifty years earlier when she answered an email from her orphaned friend Sam to investigate strange goings on at a funfair at Danemouth. Central to the mystery is a red-faced girl named Eve, who was sent to Earth to escape a war on her home planet and is being cared for by Harry, a caretaker at the funfair. People have been disappearing and she tells Rani that they are lonely people whom she has taken so that they might have fun. She also shows Rani a vision of herself in fifty years time - as the madwoman in the attic discovered by Adam.

 Who's that? What do you want? It's OK. I'm not going to hurt you. No? No. You just wanted to see if the stories were true. You wanted to meet the mad old woman of Bannerman Road. SHE CHUCKLES Well, come closer, then. Take a look. What's your name? My name is Rani. Rani Chandra. What do you want? It's just...well, at school, there's all these rumours about this place. About you. So what are you? Nosy? Inquisitive?

 I remember being that. What year is it? What? When you're on your own, you tend to forget things. People, places... I don't even know what year it is. It's 2059, Ms Chandra. It's Rani. Ms Chandra makes me sound like a teacher. So what's your name? I'm Adam. I live across the road. I wanted your name, not your life story. So what do you want, Adam? I want to know who you are. Gah. SHE GASPS No! No. It's OK. I've got it. They're all I've got. Who are they? They're gone. My friends... my mum and dad... Gone. All of them. This old attic is full of ghosts. I mean, for me. It's full of ghosts for me. Ghosts of the people I used to love. My friend Luke used to live here. He was the same age as me. Well, sort of. And he lived here with his mum. Sarah Jane Smith was mysterious and moody and, oh, you did not want to get on the wrong side of her. But I thought she was wonderful. She saved the world so many times. She changed my life, and I never told her how grateful I was. Back then everything moved so fast, and you never think about how it might end. The things we did. The...people we met. People? In those days, it wasn't like today. Everyone knew about them, of course. They'd seen the Daleks and the Cybermen. But they didn't know everything. THUNDER CRASHES Monsters, aliens, they don't scare you? Not even a little bit? Not even the one behind you now? SHE LAUGHS Yeah, funny(!) If you had all these friends, if you had such a great life, how did you end up like this? Because I made a mistake. What do you mean? When I was a girl, I wanted to be a journalist. Every morning, I'd go on the internet looking for stories, things that might be worth investigating. One morning, it was a Saturday, I found something that I thought could be... Really worth investigating. We've been talking to Maria. Never mind that. See what I've found. The lights around the BT Tower - they're saying it was lightning. Rani... They want us to think that... Rani... It could have been a spaceship... Rani! It was lightning. Mr Smith checked it out this morning. It really was just lightning. Oh. Right. Maria's been helping the government hide aliens. What? Haven't you heard? She's the new Sarah Jane! Oh! Last week, she met aliens who look like the Fimbles. She was winding you up. No, she wasn't. I've met the Zodin before. Stripy and...they're odd... OTHERS LAUGH You wouldn't laugh. You really wouldn't. That's cool. It really wasn't cool. Maria was this girl they knew before me who'd moved to America. So that morning, it just felt like I wasn't one of the gang. And I was annoyed with Sarah Jane because it was like she hadn't taken me seriously. Then...I got an e-mail. E-MAIL PINGS They weren't the only ones with friends from before we met. Samuel Lloyd. Was he your boyfriend? No, nothing like that. We were best friends back in Danemouth. That was where we lived before we moved to London. We stayed in touch, for a while at least. Then he went quiet. He'd stopped e-mailing, stopped texting. He just stopped. But that Saturday, out of the blue, he e-mailed me. He'd found something suspicious which he wanted me to investigate. Sam! Sam! Hi, Rani. It's so good to see you. What happened? You disappeared off Facebook and everything. Come on. So, why haven't you come to visit me yet? I told you, London's brilliant. I don't remember it being so dead here. Are you all right? I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be? It's just... Why did you start ignoring me? I didn't. It doesn't matter. But we said. When I moved away, we said we'd stay friends. I missed you. You were my best mate. I was busy, OK? Anyway, you had London and Sarah Jane Smith and the aliens. I told you that was a secret. You haven't told anyone, have you? You deal with that stuff - deal with it. Wow. Even the Pleasure Park's closed down. Over the past three months, four people have disappeared. They were homeless, so no-one cared. This kid came down one night and broke in. Said he saw a demon in the Haunted Mine. A what? A red demon. He said it was like fire, you know? Living fire. What about you? Have you seen anything? I haven't been in there. That's why I e-mailed you. You do this kind of thing. You think what this kid saw had something to do with the missing people? Sam! You investigate the mystery. That's what you do, isn't it? GATES RATTLE Who needs a sonic lipstick? TAPE RECORDER BEEPS This is Rani Chandra, investigating the Danemouth Pleasure Park. It's deserted, empty, and if Sam says there's a demon here, I'll find it. 'There's something moving.' RUNNING FOOTSTEPS ON TAPE PANTING ON TAPE 'Hello?' I can see you, you know. Sorry. A kid threw my rucksack in here. I had to climb over the fence. Well, now you've got it, you'd best be on your way. I think I've twisted my ankle. Oh. Well, you should, um... Is there somewhere I could sit down? Please, it really hurts. This is, er, my office. Right. What's your name? Rani. Rani Chandra. Well, Rani, I'm Harry Sowersby. Now, you really shouldn't be here, you know. It's not safe. You're here. Well, I'm the caretaker, I'm meant to be here. How's your ankle? It still hurts. Is that you? Er, yes. Look, do you want me to call someone? You were so good-looking. And really... Young? Yeah. I suppose I was, really. Yeah, that was just out there, you know. Ooh, 50 years ago now. This land, this...town, it's meant so much to so many children. But it's all gone now. What happened? The credit crunch. People can't afford to have fun any more. So now it's just you? Until they sell the land, that's right. Just you... ..here...alone. (Yeah.) You know, it's just I heard there might be something else here. In the Haunted Mine? No. Sorry? There's nothing here. I think you should go. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Just go. Don't look back. Please. TANNOY: 'Playtime is beginning.' What's that? 'Playtime is beginning.' Yeah, right, it's just you here! 'Playtime is beginning.' Playtime must begin. Hello? Hi! Well, this is weird. Four people on the rides. How did they get in? And what's happened to their eyes? FAIRGROUND MUSIC PLAYS The way they were just smiling... Then what? Sarah Jane Smith, of course. Either of you heard from Rani? Not since she came round earlier. Gita just phoned. Rani told her she was spending the day with us. Why would she lie to her mum? I don't know. I hope she wasn't upset about earlier. What are you on about? Well, I was maybe a bit... dismissive about the lightning at the BT Tower. She isn't answering her phone. You think that's where she's gone? I told her we'd looked into it. She lied to her mum. She's up to something. I guess we'd better find out what. HE GASPS Oh, no. I seem to have left a "really important book" at Rani's house. You're not going to ask what book? There isn't one. It's a trick to see if there's a clue over there. Lukey-boy, you're learning! Hello? Can you hear me? TANNOY: 'Playtime is over.' 'Playtime is over.' 'Playtime is over.' PHONE RINGS Not now, Luke. 'Playtime is over.' 'Playtime is over.' FOOTSTEPS APPROACH HE PANTS She got an e-mail. From an old mate. Sam Lloyd... Danemouth...missing people. So many stairs! Danemouth? Isn't that where Rani used to live? I thought I could trust her. Mum? Rani's been telling this boy about everything we do! Mr Smith, I need you. FANFARE PLAYS What can I do for you, Sarah Jane? Sam Lloyd, 15. Living in a town called Danemouth. Can you find him? Searching...Samuel Lloyd. Born 23rd June, 1994. Currently resides in the Saint Anthony's Children's Home. He's in care? His parents died in 2001 in a car accident. Poor kid. Right, come on. Where are we going? Danemouth, of course. They were so worried. Why? You weren't a kid. Did you tell anyone where you were going tonight? So nobody knows where you are? I am the mad old woman of Bannerman Road. I could eat children, for all you know. Mr Smith, I think I need you. He stopped working years ago. He died. 'They're definitely possessed by something. 'They've got red eyes and they're just sitting on the rides.' It's alien. It's definitely alien. And that means there's an alien here. Your ankle seems to have got better quickly. Are you an alien? I've met them before. I'm not scared of you. Oh, sweetheart, you wouldn't understand. You should just go. These people, you're keeping them prisoner. It's not like that. They're happy. 'Prepare for playtime'. What are you doing? They came from in there. Rani, where are you going? To find out what's in there. 'Playtime must begin.' Rani, please, go home. Not till I know what's going on here. There's nothing going on. Everything's fine. I'll do the talking. Thanks, Mrs Chang. We shouldn't be long. KNOCK AT DOOR It's open. Clyde Langer, Luke Smith and...Sarah Jane Smith. All right, Sammy? How's things? My name is Sam. Yeah, Rani told us about you. Said you were good mates. We were. I know about your parents. It's not easy, is it? I was just a kid. I'm fine. My parents died when I was young. I know that it's never fine. I'll tell you where Rani is. You don't have to be nice to me. She's with her. Who? Who was she? The demon. It's not what you think. She's not a bad girl. Hello? I'm Rani. Who is she? She's my little girl. She's my Eve. She just wants to play. Harry? What's going on? Hello? Are you all right? 'Are you my new friend?' A demon? It must be an alien. We've got to get to the park and find Rani. Someone should stay here and talk to Sam. He knows more than he's telling. I'll stay. I think I can get through to him. Come on, Ms Smith. I still need you. My name's Rani. Rani Chandra. It's OK, I've met aliens before. 'I know'. Right. So you can read my mind? 'You don't need to keep proving yourself'. What? 'You're worried that your 'parents are disappointed in you, especially your dad. 'You hide it behind jokes and laughter, but it's there, deep down. 'And you worry about a girl called Maria. You worry that Sarah Jane 'Smith doesn't think you're as good as her'. OK, can you not read my mind? 'You shouldn't worry. 'I can see how they look at you. 'Just glimpses. They love you... 'They're proud of you. You should be happy'. I am happy. You're amazing. I know. Are you sure you know where we're going? I knew I should have brought Luke. He moans less than you. I run faster, though. Hey, I was holding back so you could keep up. Ha ha! Yeah. Yeah, right, yeah. Hey, Rani's going to be OK. Easy to say, and if she isn't, I brought you all into this. Like you had a choice. What? Well, we chose you, you didn't choose us. No, I don't think so. You are getting old, you know. Your memory's going. Oh! Come on. Oh, you're not going to take an old lady's hand? I might fall if you don't. It's all right. I've got my mobile phone, so I can call the ambulance if your hip goes. Zac Efron? OK, stop it now! He is fit. Stop it! Your mind is so full of such... There's so much in there. The things you're going to see, the things you've seen. Me? You're from up there, you must have seen loads! I mean, what's your planet like? I don't know. What is it? There was a war... It was a long time ago. You know about my life. There were these two races, and they had a war. My people weren't involved, but because we could read the timelines, they attacked us. So many were exterminated. My parents put me in a ship and sent me out into space. Like an evacuee? I was so young. I can see into your mind. I can see what your mum and dad look like. I can't remember my mum's face. I could have climbed over. My way's more stylish. So is Harry keeping you prisoner? He says it's dangerous outside. He sounds like my dad. Adults are boring. They should just let us play. What about those people outside? The ones on the rides? They're my friends. What have you done to them? They were lonely. Sad. Now they're having fun. Hello? Are you all right? Stupid question. Hello? Can you see me? Hello! Hello? My name's Harry. I'm the caretaker here. Can I help you? Why are you still here, Luke? I want to get to know you. You're Rani's friend and so are we. She's not my friend. Not any more. What do you mean? You never had someone leave you? Someone you thought was your best friend for ever? I had a friend called Maria. She moved to America. Yeah, but you've got your mum. And Clyde. Don't you have any other friends? No. But there are kids here. Kids you could be friends with. You don't have to be alone. I'm not alone. Why would anybody come here? I mean, we've shut down. What about the zombies out there? They're just messing about. They didn't seem to be having fun. Look, I haven't seen this girl. I mean, why would she come here anyway? Rani's interested in the history of Danemouth. Yeah. Cos she's... I don't even know what that is. It's not like she'd find anything, anyway. You know what she's like. She's stupid. Oi. That's rather rude, young man. You've never met her, mate. She's thick and stupid. That's a horrible thing to say. True, though. Well, I thought she seemed all... Gotcha! She's safe. You've got to believe me. Eve, you have to let those people go, and then I can help you get home. But you won't tell your mum about me. What? You find it so difficult. GCSEs and Judoon. Your parents, and Sarah Jane Smith. Sometimes it's hard, yeah. Trying to do it all. Having to keep this sort of thing secret. What are you doing? I told you, I'm sensitive to time. I can see your past. Sometimes you feel left out. It was lightning. Mr Smith checked it out this morning. Maria's been helping aliens hide from the government. She's the new Sarah Jane! It's not like that... Not really. It's OK, I can see how it could have made you feel. I can see how it would have hurt you. It was a one-off. I overreacted. Sarah Jane, Luke and Clyde have been trying to contact you, but you want to punish them. You need them, Rani. You're lost without them. I'm not. I don't need them. PHONE RINGS I wish they'd just leave me alone. Where is she, Harry? I...I can't say. Fine. I'll just call the police. 'Sarah Jane Smith.' What is that? 'Harry, bring her to me.' What is that? Sarah Jane? 'I wish to know who Sarah Jane Smith is. 'And I wish to know who Luke Smith is'. Do you want to see your future? I don't think we should. Why? What harm can it do? But...it's wrong. Is that what Sarah Jane tells you? Let's do it. Are you sure you want to see? It'll make everything clearer. Do it! 'See your future.' I can see it! My name is Rani... Rani Chandra. Oh, God, make it stop! Please! No. I can't become that! I'm so lost, so alone... The mad old woman of Bannerman Road! 'The things she's seen...' How's my little darling? 'He is returning. He is coming back.' We need the darkness, it is our future. She must stop playing. She will die. Rani! Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail subtitling@bbc.co.uk
