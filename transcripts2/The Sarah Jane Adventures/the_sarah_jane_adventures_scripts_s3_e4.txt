 The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007â€“2011): Season 3, Episode 4 - The Mad Woman in the Attic: Part 2 - full transcript 
 Ship, the talking computerised space ship which brought Eve to the Earth is all set to take her back to her home planet along with Sam and Harry. By this time Sarah Jane and the boys have arrived at the funfair. Rani declines to accompany the space travellers but a comment she makes, wishing that Sarah Jane, Luke and Clyde would leave her alone, is taken too literally by the spaceship, which makes them all disappear, paving the way for the projection of Rani's future as the sad madwoman in the attack. In 2059 Adam reveals that he is the son of Eve and Sam and grants Rani a wish. Her wish is to turn back time to be with her friends again.

 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives. It's home to things way beyond your imagination. There's an extra-terrestrial super computer in the wall. A genetically engineered boy genius in the attic. A schoolgirl investigator across the road. And a whole universe of adventure right here on our doorstep. Ready? Always. My name is Rani. Rani Chandra. I'm Adam. I want to know who you are. This attic is full of ghosts, those of the people I used to love. When I was a girl, I wanted to be a journalist.

 One morning I found something that I thought could be... totally worth investigating. Rani. A spaceship... Rani, it was lightning, Mr Smith checked it out this morning. 'It felt like I wasn't one of the gang.' Oh, right. 'And I was annoyed with Sarah Jane 'because it was like she hadn't taken me seriously. Then I got an email.' Samuel Lloyd, we were best friends back in Danemouth, but that Saturday, out of the blue, he emailed me. he wanted me to investigate something. A red demon, I'd say it was like fire you know, living fire. Playtime is beginning. Samuel Lloyd currently resides in the St Anthony's children's home. Rani's been telling this boy about everything we do.

 Hello! Can you hear me? I thought I could trust her. She's with her. The demon. Are you my new friend? I can see your past, Sarah Jane, Luke and Clyde have been trying to contact you. I don't need them. I wish they'd just leave me alone. I wish to know who Sarah Jane Smith is. And I wish to know who Luke Smith is. Do you want to see your future? My name is Rani. Please, no! I can't become that! They read our timelines. Ship showed Luke his past. All he needs now is a name. I like Luke. I like Luke. I'm going to miss you so much. And then his future. APPLAUSE The darkness. What? The things she's seen. She showed Sarah Jane her whole life. I'm Sarah Jane Smith. I'm a journalist. Sarah Jane Smith. Danger, Mistress. Don't forget me. Don't you forget me. And then her future, too. He is returning, he is coming back. What happened? What did that thing do to her? Bring her back! Oh, I don't think so. The darkness! I saw it in her mind. We need the darkness! It is our future! Rani? Why did you show me that? I thought it would stop the confusion in your head about your mum and GCSEs and boys and... I'm going to end up like that? An old woman? Alone? I could feel it. I was... So lonely. I saw this. I saw this future. My future. And I told myself, I... Won't let that happen! Whatever I do, I won't become... ..like that! I'm not going to be alone. But it happened. How? Because of what I did. Right. We're not staying here. You're not staying here. Look at me, Rani. I can't go outside! You can and you're going to. We're going to find your spaceship and you're going home! What just happened? Calling Mummy? Don't you think that was a bit weird? You're the weird one. You're not even human. I am. I saw you. You were made. Like Frankenstein. I'm more like the creature. Frankenstein was the name of the man who made the creature. Rani said you were clever. She said a few things about you as well. What do you mean? She was really upset when you started ignoring her. Yeah, right. She was too busy to be upset. She kept going on about you and Clyde and Sarah Jane and space and Sontarans. I was stuck here. By myself. I couldn't listen to it any more. Rani told you about what we do. Do you know how big that is? That's breaking every rule. You tricked her into coming here. I didn't trick her. I asked her to come. Why? Because someone saw something in a theme park? You'd been ignoring her for months. I was scared. It was you, wasn't it? You went into the park. You met the demon. She's not a demon. She's called Eve, she's my friend. She... she read my mind and because I knew about Rani meeting aliens and that, Eve knew. So she wanted you to bring Rani here? Eve won't hurt her. Do you know that for sure? What do you mean, you saw your future? I saw the Tardis. In the attic. Sarah Jane, look at me! OK. That face in the mirror, it's dangerous, OK? Rani's here somewhere and we have to find her. You're right. Sorry, come on. You thinking what I'm thinking? The park's been closed for months. Harry seems like an organised kind of guy. So why's the door to the Haunted Mine open? Sometimes, I think we're too good. Yes, I just hope there are no nasty surprises inside. For a change. Do you know where your ship crashed? Harry said he found me on the beach. And he says it's not safe outside? I guess he meant people would think I'm weird. It had to be a haunted mine, didn't it? You're not scared, are you? Me Clyde. Me not get scared. After everything we've seen? Me get scared sometimes. You? Me? Nah! So humans like being scared? Well, no. Sort of. It's difficult to explain. The universe is full of nightmares and you make fake ones. Yeah. We're weird. What is it? I don't know. Did you hear something? I feel a bit stupid now. We've been trying to call you! Yes, it's good to see you, mate. Aren't you going to introduce us? Yeah, this is Eve. She's not trying to take over the world or anything! Are you sure? There's a mirror out there that can read minds. Not forgetting the red-eyed zombies. She only wanted to make them happy. Rani, you haven't got a clue what we're dealing with! No, cos I'm just a stupid kid who never gets anything right! They didn't have cups... Rani! MOBILE RINGS Luke? 'It's Sam. He's disappeared.' He told me about someone called Eve. And there was a face in his mirror. Mum, he showed me my future! Are you OK? I'm fine. Right, stay there. Check his computer, go through his emails. I'll call you later. Rani. That mirror, or whatever it was, it's powerful. It read my mind. And it read Luke's, too. It told us our future. But nothing can know the future. We can change it. It's up to us what we do, isn't it? Oh, it's beautiful. Oh, the wind! The air! Oh, Rani! Eve. I want to play! Oh, yes! Oh, this is wonderful. Eve, listen to me! You've got to stop this! She's controlling the rides. Eve! What's going on? What are you doing out here? It's not safe! I told you! You've got to let these people go! They're getting faster. Eve! Listen to me! You can't tell me what to do. Rani brought me outside. Come on. The mirror. Mirror? Can you hear me? What is your wish? We'd like to know what's going on. Eve! Eve is outside. She must stop! Playtime is over. Eve! Stop it! You can't control people like this. Please, sweetheart, come inside. Please! Right. Suit yourself. Rani? I thought we were friends. We are! You want friends who do whatever you say. Don't go! You can't leave me! I can. Oh, no, really you can't. You must bring her to me. She's too young. She cannot control her powers. Who are you? I am Ship. Eve's spaceship? Yes. My primary function is to keep Eve safe. So why did you let Harry take her? Harry keeps her safe. I needed to reboot. After the crash. Playtime keeps her occupied. And how are you now? I am at 87%. She must stop playing. She will die. Eve? What's going on? Rani, I'm sorry. Rani? What have you done to her? She was scared of the future. Scared of growing old. Now she'll be young and happy forever. She's trying to control too much. She hasn't yet been taught how to use her powers. She is a child trying to be an adult and it will burn her mind! Eve. Please, sweetheart, please stop this. You're making yourself ill. What's happening to me? The power in you, it's too much for you to cope with. What have you done to her? Let her go! No! I don't want to be lonely. You won't be! You've got me! Eve, you've got to let them go! My parents died. So did Sam's. And Clyde's dad walked out on him. Life isn't easy, Eve, but none of it means you've got to be alone. You need friends. Real friends. Not people you're forcing to stay with you. Harry? What should I do? Stop this. Let them go. It'll be fine. Playtime is over. Rani? I can't! I can't do it! You have to! I can't. I don't know how. What about Ship? Why couldn't she stop it? Only if they took Eve to her. They took her back to the beach. Do you know where your ship is? Eve, can you sense it? Yeah. It's... It's here. Have you found it? Wait. I can feel it. I can feel her. Whoa, stand back! That's a spaceship? Open. Ship! Careful. Eve! You are home! Ship? I am glad you are safe, Eve. Please, Ship. My head hurts. I want this to stop. I want my friends to be free. Place your hands on the core. I will draw the energy from you. What happened? Where is everyone? They've gone to the beach to find Eve's ship. Come on! Eve needs you. I've got to go. Help yourselves to anything. The ship was boosting Eve's energy. And now it's taking it back. I'm fine. I'm fine. Ship? Sarah Jane Smith. It is good to meet you. Ship, Eve's not going to be safe here on earth. Not everyone's like Harry and Sam. That's why I needed you. The darkness. What do you mean? The darkness is our fuel. I saw it in your mind. The black, black... I think you call it a black hole. A black hole? My engines use them for fuel. A black hole? Easy. Mr Smith, I need you! Yes, Sarah Jane? Oh, well actually for once, it's not you I need. It's K9. Your robot dog? That's the one! Patch me through, Mr Smith. Boosting telephone signal, connecting now. Greetings, Mistress. K9? Can you hear me? Affirmative, Mistress. 'K9. You're coming home! For good this time.' Sarah Jane's got this metal dog and he's trapped in this space void dimension thing, stopping Earth being sucked up by a black hole. That is rather improbable. It's brilliant! K9. I'm in a spaceship under a beach on the South coast. Improbable's the word. The ship needs a black hole. Can you help? Affirmative, Mistress. Spaceship, can you read me? I am currently generating a shield around the black hole. If you send me your co-ordinates, I can absorb the energy. Sending co-ordinates now. This is mad. K9's coming home! My mission is completed! Greetings, Mr Smith. It's good to see you, K9. Will you be staying here now? Affirmative. Oh, good. Black hole energy absorbed. Ship operating at maximum capacity. Eve. What is your wish? I want to go into space and I want to see everything. Oh, you better let us off first! Clyde's got exams coming up! Of course. Eve, we should thank those who helped us. Oh, my goodness. I'm in a spaceship! Rani! I'm free! I can go! I'm happy for you. Thank you. Thank you so much. What for? For being my friend. That is why we got Sam to bring you here, Rani. We knew from his mind you were clever, he knew you would be able to help Eve. Me? Oh... thanks. I am so sorry. I was jealous. You were in London, seemed like you were having such a cool time and I was stuck here. And... I missed you. I'm really sorry. I'm just glad you got to see all this. And now we have to go. Well, I should... You could stay. I could? If you wanted to. I've nothing to go home to. I'd like you to come with us. We could really go anywhere? In space? Yeah. I don't know what to say. Say yes, you idiot! Yes! Well, I should be going as well. Eve, I know I wasn't like your dad or anything... Stay with me. What? Please. But... But I've had my life. I can't... It's never too late. Really? Oh! That is one mixed-up family. D'you think they're going to be OK? I think they're going to be fantastic. Come on. Wait, please. Rani, you helped Eve when I couldn't. Before we leave, I need to grant you your wish. My what? 'Sarah Jane, Luke and Clyde they've been trying to contact you, 'but you want to punish them. You need them, Rani.' I wish they'd just leave me alone! I was in a bad mood, I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. No, it's OK. I will grant you your wish. Ship! No! Ship! Where are they? I have granted your wish. No, Ship, that's not what she meant! You must leave now, Rani. Playtime is over. 'Playtime is over.' The spaceship left Earth, I was all alone. Sarah Jane, Clyde and Luke. Gone. Because of me. Rani, I'm not from across the road. What? My mum sent me. I don't understand. Eve? She's my mum. But you look human. Sam? Sam's your dad? Ship had been damaged. She got it wrong. Oh, it got it so wrong. You helped my mum all those years ago, now we want to help you. How? What can you do? I can put things right. Return things to the way they should be. But what about you? I'll go back to Ship, you'll forget all of this. You'll forget me. So, what is your wish? To put it right. Please. I wish Ship hadn't taken them from me. Your wish is my command. It's starting, time's changing. Goodbye, Rani. Thank you. Thank you so much. That was one mixed-up family. Do you think they're going to be OK? I think they're going to be fantastic. Come on. Wait for me. Prepare for take-off. It was quite big down there. Shouldn't we move back? That is... Amazing. Thank you. Thank you so much for sharing this with me. And I'm sorry for coming here alone and I'm so sorry for telling Sam about what we do. No, Rani. I'm sorry. What for? Maybe you were right to tell Sam. I've spent so many years alone, I still find it difficult to trust people. But, you know, they're not all out to get us and sometimes I forget that. Sometimes visitors to this world just need a friend. Come on. Let's go. Mistress arrival detected. K9, my man! How are you doing? I'm doing well, Master Clyde. Oh, welcome home, K9. C'mon everyone, group photo. Use mine, it's got a timer. Gadget boy. Put it there. You all right? Yeah, Eve showed me my future but I'm not going to worry about it, here and now, that's what matters. That's right. C'mon. We'll face the future together. He is coming back. Come on, Mum, in you get. Yeah. All right. K9, say, "Cheese."  He can't say cheese. Yes, he can. Cheese! Fermented curds. Cheese! Cheese! Grandma Rani! Ah, baby. You all right, Mum? How was Washington? Oh, it was good. Luke and I caught up with Maria. Oh, I missed you lots. All right, all right, calm down. I'm not as young as I used to be. Now go and play on the computer. She's off again. Right, we're coming over. Why's she lying to us? His name is Peter Dalton. We're getting married. What am I supposed to call him? Dad? Oh, Clyde, Peter is not an alien. I've made you all so suspicious, but this is a happy thing, I want you all to be part of it. METALLIC THRUMMING Sarah!
