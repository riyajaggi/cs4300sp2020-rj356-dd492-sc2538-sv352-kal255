 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives. And it's home to things way beyond your imagination. There's an extra-terrestrial super computer in the wall, a genetically engineered boy genius in the attic. A schoolgirl investigator across the road. And a whole universe of adventure right here on the doorstep. Ready? Always. Robots, too small to see with the naked eye, but with the potential of giants. Go bo go mo mo! He's Judoon, a sort of galactic policeman.

 The Judoon's only interested in stopping that creature getting away. No! Leave her alone. Mr Smith...I need you. 'Sarah Jane has instructed my self-detonation protocols 'to initiate - I will explode in 60 seconds.' 'Detonation in 55 seconds. You must run. Now.' Mr Smith, stop it! 'I cannot cancel Sarah Jane's order.' But it wasn't Sarah Jane that ordered you to explode - it was some freaky alien inside her! 'Detonation in 40 seconds. 'Only she can command me to disarm.' I stop. No! We need Mr Smith to find Mum!

 Then do something. Now. 'You have 32 seconds.' Come on, Luke. YOU can do this. I'm trying to think... You haven't got time to think. You're a genius. What would Einstein do? He never had an alien computer in his attic that turned into a bomb. (VOICE BREAKING) '22 seconds. Please. Run.' Mr Smith, you're a Xylok and what is most important to a Xylok? 'Purpose.' I was expecting wire cutters here, not chit-chat. And what is your purpose? What did Mum tell you was your purpose? 'To defend and protect Earth.' And that purpose over-rides all other protocols? 'Yes.' Ten Earth seconds. Mum's orders endanger Earth. Your purpose over-rides her command. You have to stop the detonation. 'Your point seems logical. I must consider it.' No! Just do it! (VOICE NORMAL) 'Detonation suspended.' Who else could talk a bomb out of going off? Mr Smith, where is Mum? Now, Mr Yorke, input the nanoform activation codes. I don't have much time. You're mad! You said yourself the nanoforms can't do no more than push a few atoms together. I think you'll find they've just been upgraded. Agh! Enter the codes. You are crazy! Don't worry. I've brought blueprints. Your nanoforms... are going to build me a spaceship. SHE GROWLS 'In 1947, a spaceship crash-landed in New Mexico.' You're talking about Roswell. You mean that really happened? Come on. Try to keep up. 'The US military re-engineered a craft from the wreckage. 'Androvax had me acquire the schematics from their Dreamland 'base in Arizona.' She's taken them to Genetec. Of course, nanoform technology could build it from raw atoms. What are you talking about? Oh, Mum was doing an article on nanoforms, tiny robots that can build anything. Androvax is going to get them to build him a spaceship. Before the Judoon get here in 30 minutes? But nanoforms have to be stored dormant at sub-zero temperatures because of the massive energy they create when activated. They're fast, Clyde. Must hurry. Stop Androvax escaping. 'Sarah Jane - or Androvax - knew you would follow. 'So my self-destruct protocols were engaged.' Yeah. Well, Androvax isn't going to leg it with Sarah Jane, because we're going to stop him, before Captain Tybo's space-plods get here. HE GROWLS No offence. 'The matter is more pressing than that, Clyde.' BEEPING What's happening? The nanoforms, they're multiplying! They're responding to my programming. The safety protocols can't cope with that rate of multiplication. They'll swarm! I'm releasing them, Mr Yorke! I'm releasing them to build my ship! If they get into the environment, they'll take the whole planet apart! They have been programmed to build my spacecraft. My escape from the Judoon. Then what better way to cover my tracks than to destroy Earth? Do your work, my Army of the Infinitesimal! ALARM BEEPS Um, what is that? A fire alarm? Just stay there. You can't just leave us here! You can't go anywhere, you're under arrest. There's a Level One Security Alert. The building's been locked down. I'm not standing for this! I don't think he's listening. Haresh, don't get upset, my darling, but you are more of a Jamie Oliver than a James Bond. And what's that supposed to mean? Piccalilli's more your style than picking locks. Gita, just let me concentrate. They were in the drawer. Look - Mum's definitely here. Yeah, and that's great, but does someone want to tell me what's going on up there? What IS that? It's the nanoforms, they're building Androvax's spaceship. So the Judoon and his puerile posse have survived my trap. Perhaps that strange boy of yours really is as special as you seem to think, Sarah Jane. Oh, he is! And, believe me, he and the others, they will stop you. I don't think so! I'm sure your security systems will keep them at bay, Mr Yorke. Come on, we've only got ten minutes until Judoon enter Earth orbit. Judoon will secure building. Androvax trapped. Yeah? And what about Sarah Jane? Humans irrelevant. How can you say that? Sarah Jane's my mother! Halt! What? Do not infringe directive. What? You've got to be kidding! You pay, you display. It's locked! Has to be some way out. Come on! It's locked. Key. ALARM STOPS I must have a magic touch. What have you done? Over-ridden the security systems. Unlocked the lock-down. You know, I think you've outgrown your usefulness. That's where she must be. The laboratories. Which ones? This place goes on forever. Right now, we've got another problem. Er, it's all right. He's the police, honest. Evenin', all. You obstruct Judoon. No! No-one said anything about flaming aliens in the contract! Come on! What is it? My mum and dad. What? Mum. She gave Gita the Genetec brochure. Remember? Parents compromise mission. No! You leave them alone! Come on. Quickly. But Mum and Dad, they don't know what they've walked into. They'll find their way out. Don't worry. Come on, the Judoon will be in orbit any minute. This way. There has to be a way out somewhere. Haresh...! I know. Sho blo fo jo mo! Hello. And welcome to Earth. Yes, very nice to meet you. BUZZING We hope you come in peace. Language assimilated. Earth English. You will be catalogued. Species, human. Unimportant. Just a minute. This is our planet...and I demand to know what you're doing here. Haresh, it may be our planet, but it isn't your school. Perhaps we should just let them get on. Female of species more intelligent. Obstruction carries penalty. Disintegration. So much for coming in peace! Shut up! Troop! Soon my ship will be complete! And then what, Androvax? You let the nanoforms destroy Earth? Why can't you be quiet? I needed a body to hide in, not a conscience! Everyone has a conscience, Androvax. Even you. You've just buried it so deep down you can't hear it any more. But I'm here now. And remember, that wasn't my choice! I'd be quiet if I were you. No! You leave them alone! Halt! Authorised personnel only. Oh, come on now, you are having a laugh! Rules must be obeyed. Under Shadow Proclamation's rules, you shouldn't be on Earth. Accident. Whoops! Accident! BLEEPING So yo vo cho? 'Wo mo mo.' The Judoon. They're here. I'm no maths genius, but trouble just got squared to about a zillion. If Androvax has Sarah Jane the Judoon will take both! We have to slow them down. And I think I know how. Captain Tybo! What? Look at this. You're nicked, mate. It's an electro-dampening chamber. Nothing electronic will work in there. Not Tybo's gun or his radio. The Judoon will have to find him and Mum. But, boy, are we in trouble when he gets out of there. Come on, we've got to find Mum. Luke. I've missed you so much. What's wrong? Don't you want to give me a hug?! Ho ko bro bo... They seem to be looking for something or someone. Haresh, those are aliens. Aliens with guns. I think we should be calling the police - not playing I-spy. Considering the entire building's locked, Security took your mobile and none of the phones here work, I don't see what we can do. My mobile! The security guard, he's got my phone, all my contacts. What if they disintegrate him? I'll be proper scuppered. Come on, we'd better go and find it. There are more Judoon here now. They'll find you. So take your spaceship and give me my mum back. I don't think so. I've come to know Sarah Jane quite well and I don't see her as the type to wave me off. How could you do that? Take over someone else's body? It's horrible! You body-snatching alien scumbag! We won't let you get away with it! You're not only little more than children, you're human children. You've barely dried off since your species crawled out of the sea. I am a Veil. My kind were conquering worlds when yours was little more than a ball of superheated gas. And all you've evolved into is a killer, that destroys planets and takes over other people's bodies? My mum will beat you. I don't care what you are, she's strong and is going to kick you out. You can fight him, Sarah Jane! We know you're there. We know you can hear us! Fight this alien. You're stronger! You can beat him! Luke... I love you. Mum. It's not her! Luke! Careful. Not so fast you two. who would ever have thought a sonic cosmetic could be such a useful accessory? METALLIC GRATING What's that? Some of my infinitesimal army. They're hungry. And it's time to feed - on your entire planet! And you two? You'll make delicious hors-d'oeuvres! Run! They're right behind us! No way am I gonna be nano-food. I like my atoms just the way they are! Come on! Back! I think we lost them. For now. Well, that door should hold them. For about ten seconds. Nothing stops 'em. Those nanoforms are going to eat us, the building and then the whole world! This is a laboratory, there must be something in here we can use. Yeah. If Luke was here. Hello again, Luke. Enjoy your nap? Where's Clyde and Rani? You'd better not have hurt them. You're the boy genius, what do you think? Grown from synthesised DNA. The perfect human being. You were part of an alien invasion, but...Sarah Jane really does have a habit of meddling. It's a pity she didn't take up knitting, instead! She's saved more planets than you've destroyed. In time, those worlds would all have died. It is the way of the universe. Now, come on. The nanoforms have completed my ship. The nanoforms built this? It's amazing! The doors won't last much longer. Think! What would Luke do? I don't know. I get by on good looks and one-liners. I'm not supposed to understand all this techie stuff. Yeah, I know you're the cool one. Cool isn't much help right now! That's it! "Cool"! Luke said nanoforms have to be stored at sub-zero temperatures. Dormant! He said they were kept dormant! If they get cold they go to sleep. Sho jo wo mo mo! Vo bo no-no! No-no? Yo blo mo! Ow! Mo ko blo blo sho mo fo fo bo wo ho cho bo ho ho uno vo vo vo VO! Here they come! Atomise this! It's working! It's working! Not so buzzy now, are you? The Co2 only switches them off for a while. We have to find some way of stopping them for good. Before they take the whole world apart! Come on. You've got your spaceship. The Judoon aren't going to catch you. Let my mum go. And give her a chance to save Earth? If you think I care, you're talking to the wrong species. Why don't you care? Why destroy all these worlds? Because his own world was destroyed, Luke. Mum? Is that you? That's enough! Of course, she knows everything about you. Just like you do about her. He's so angry, Luke. No more! That's what you meant when you said all worlds die. You saw it happen to your world. What happened? Our sun turned cold as I travelled the stars. I returned and found my world a ball of ice. My people frozen at its heart. I was alone, so alone and I had seen so many worlds that teemed with life. Happiness, hope. Fools! I would teach them what the universe would do to them. You destroyed them because you were jealous?  Because the only truth of the universe is destruction! And now... ..it's so very close...again. What's going on? You are convicted of multiple offences. Justice will be swift. The nanoforms, they're attacking the building. Run! Go jo go! We've got to find Sarah Jane before Tybo finds us! It's time to leave. Oh, I don't think so! You can't stop me! Luke! How did you get in here? Mr Smith showed me the ship's schematics. I know everything about it. Where the door controls are. You can't take it anywhere without the ionic fusion bar. Give it to me! You can have it, Androvax. But you have to come and get it. Not my mum. Release my mum and you can take off. After you've disabled the nanoforms! What do you say? Deal? No wonder Sarah Jane is so proud of you. It makes me want to be sick. Give it to me! The nanoforms! Androvax the Annihilator! Prepare for judgment! No! You will face Shadow Proclamation and execution. No. First you have to let him disable the nanoforms. It's too late! What's happening? I told you, Luke, the truth of the universe is destruction. Nothing can stop it. There may be destruction in the universe - there has been for billions of years. But without it, the universe wouldn't evolve. And that's what the universe is really about. Survival! Just watch. I know this sounds like a stupid question, but do you know what you're doing? The nanoforms built this computer, and I can use it to get into the Genetec systems and delete their programming. Before the whole place collapses? Cos that would be cool. Really cool. In fact, you'll be the coolest person I know. Luke. Oh, Luke there isn't much time. Don't worry, Mum, I can do this. Haresh! Hold on to me. HE LAUGHS You cannot save yourselves, humans. And send. Right, that's it, we're getting out of here! Come on. You did it! Oh, I missed you. Oh, I knew I could depend on you! The nanoforms have all been de-activated. They're harmless now. HE GROWLS It's a shame that you can't repair everything that you have done, Androvax. But at least we saved this world from you. You will be destroyed in the end. If not by me, someone will destroy you, Sarah Jane Smith! Silence! Listen, Captain, about earlier. Under circumstances, sentence commuted. Revocation of interstellar travelling rights. What? Sentence, confined to Earth. Oh, what, we're grounded! On Earth! Flight power restored. I take Androvax to teleport. Spacecraft confiscated by Judoon. Humans... go! And that's not the only reason we have to get out of here, Sarah Jane. Nothing to see. Move along. You know, Rani's never going to believe a word of this. I almost feel sorry for Androvax. All alone and so angry at the universe. The universe is about destruction, he said. Ultimately everything's about death. But that's only part of the truth. Parts of the universe are dying all the time. Planets, stars, people. But the amazing part is that it isn't the end. It's only the beginning of something new and exciting being born. Rani! Rani! Mum? What is it? Aliens! We've seen aliens! Aliens? Sir? You've seen aliens? Yes. Yes, I have. Aliens, Gita? Are you sure? Ten feet tall. Covered in metal. With these huge helmets, like rhinoceroses. Rhinoceroses. From space? Sounds like you need a cup of tea. Cup of tea, yes, and I'll tell you all about it. Come on Sarah, and don't forget your notebook. I'm telling you, this is a story you will not want to miss. This could be the making of you. I'll just go and get my pen. Rhinoceros men? Come on, sir! Gita said no-one would believe us. And why would they? We live in Bannerman Road. What's going to happen to us? Oh, that's the wonderful thing about the universe, you just never know. My name is Rani.. Rani Chandra. This old attic is full of ghosts, ghosts of the people I used to love. Playtime is beginning. Rani's telling this boy everything. She's with her. The demon. I can see your past. Sarah Jane, Luke and Clyde. I wish they'd just leave me alone. Do you want to see a picture? Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail subtitling@bbc.co.uk
