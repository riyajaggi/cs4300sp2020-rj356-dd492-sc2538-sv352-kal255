 Well, it's very nice of you to splash out on flowers for me. I didn't think you'd be interested in flowers. No, I'm not. Right. Oops. Sorry about Alex. Everyone sends their... Spit it out, Harding. You're not here on a social visit. A boy turned up on Waiheke Island last night. It's the kid that went missing years ago. What... Nathan Baum? Yep. Where did they find his body? Nah, he's alive. Just standing on the road in the middle of nowhere. Nathan Baum's alive? Uh-huh. He hasn't said a word, but, uh...

 he gave us this. Parents have been told the basics. I'd be grateful for your eyes on this, but that's all at this stage. He had my card, Pup. And you've got no idea how he got that? No. Morning. Morning, sir. Oh, God, I feel sick. It'll be fine. It'll be fine? Don't. Don't start, OK? Not now. She's changed a lot in five years. It's what you'd expect. Did they tell you he'd been abused... sexually? OK, today we get our son back from the dead. Can we please just focus on that? Where the fuck is he? And why the hell are we meeting him in a police station?! He's got a new wife and kid. The new wife, Roshni, was one of Nathan's teachers. Is the father a suspect? Everyone's a suspect... till we find out where this boy's been for the last five years. OK. Good boy. Hey, Nathan. You're so big. Mr Man. Hey. He's not ready to be touched yet. We need to give him time to feel safe. Let him decide when he's ready to be touched. When he's ready to speak. You sure you should be drinking that? Why? It's not warm, is it? Mm. So. Thoughts? Uh, well... a very small window before Nathan's kidnapper knows we've got him; 48, 72 hours max... before he runs. I wanna use as many of the local cops on the island as I can without raising the locals' suspicion, and I'm gonna need a couple of experienced guys from Auckland. I'm not sure you're the right person for the job. I'm the only person for the job. I worked that case under Bennington. Yeah. That investigation got it wrong. Yeah? Then that's another reason it should be me. How are you doing? A few headaches. Nothing I can't handle. I didn't mean your physical well-being. Um... I know the case. I know the territory, and that's the reason why I'm the right person for the job... and he had my card. Hmm. Recent one too. All right. The investigation's gonna be based on Waiheke, but I want you to report here to me, OK? Yeah. Be scrupulous, all right, Jess? Keep a lid on it. Find the person responsible. Quickly, all right? Yes, sir. Marilyn. Detective Savage. - What can I do for you? - Yeah, hi. I need to order some case files off you. File number? Delta, Tango, Foxtrot, 8-8-1-5-3-9. Uh, you already have them. What? Nathan Baum's case? They definitely went. Have they not arrived? Um. Oh, uh, yeah. They're here. Who ordered them? You did. Friday before last, 0930. You called me, remember? Friday? The Friday of my accident, OK. Jess. I want Harding on this. He needs experience on the ground. You're quick on the draw. You all right? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Harding? Really? It's not my first choice. You're home, Nath. Come on. Let's go inside, eh? Come on, Nath. Do you wanna come up? What did he say? Nothing. He hasn't said a word. Do you think he knows? Simon? Mum. Alex is dead. Must be good to be back home. Some of you were here five years ago when Nathan Baum went missing, and... We got it wrong. So figuring out what we got wrong and what we missed will most likely... lead us to Nathan's kidnapper. OK? So we... we start again. We go through the original lists first. We interview everyone who was on that trip five years ago, starting with the group that Nathan was in. Those kids, they're a bit older, maybe they've got something new to say, then the teachers and the parent helpers. I wanna talk to everyone who lives within a 2km radius of where Nathan was found. If they're not home, find them. I don't want anybody slipping under the radar, OK? And, um, what do we tell people? Um, as far as the people on the bus are concerned, the boy's a runaway from Auckland, and he's now back with his parents. It's no biggie. Tell everybody that we're doing a five-year mandatory review of the case before we close it permanently. Be subtle, OK. I don't want anybody getting a whiff that he's alive, OK? We'll lose our window. We need to get forensics to hurry up on the clothing that Nathan was found in. I've put a call in to HQ to see if they've still got the backpack and the boot found in the original case. OK. Because he... When he planted that, he... Well, he wanted us to think that Nathan had drowned. It worked. Now is not the time to go easy on your colleagues, so if there's anything that you think wasn't investigated correctly the first time, now is the time to speak up. Got it? We need to get organised... hit the ground running. Don't touch my armpits. I need a glass of Jager. Mum! Ah, no. Ow, ow, ow. I didn't know you were coming home. Obviously. Fuck. This place is such a mess, Ruby. Hi, Miss Savage. Don't suck arse to her. It just makes her worse. Can we turn the fucking music down? You smoking drugs? It's not drugs; it's just dope. - I'm a cop, Ruby. - Oh, God. Here it comes. Blah, blah. I'm a cop. Don't start, please. Fine. Come on, AJ. Let's get out of here before she has us arrested. Hey, uh... hope you get better soon. Ruby. Thank you for being there when they put me in a coma. I'm really sorry that I couldn't be at the funeral for you. I didn't go. Why? Because I'm not a hypocrite. I'm not gonna pretend I liked him just because he's dead. Fuck. Alex. Denise. Uh, yeah. I thought you'd like to see exactly where the boy turned up. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great. Uh, but first, I'd like to clear the air between us. Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think you should be heading this case. Your involvement in the investigation when Nathan first disappeared should have ruled you out. All right, well, you've got that off your chest. Yeah, I'm a straight talker, Jess. You know me. Anything else you want to add? Uh, actually, yes. Now seems as good a time as any to offer my condolences... for Alex's death. I mean, you know, he was a hell of a nice man. Mm. Um. So, uh, Jack Brodie said that the boy was standing here, right in the middle of the road. So we searched a 200m radius... nothing of interest. We'll extend that to 2 K now. Oh, there's an old couple... live about half a K up that way. And then there's Billy Brax about 200m down there. No priors. That place, that's a non-residence down the beach there. Hm. They're a good bunch of cops on the island, Jess. You know that. They'll do a thorough job. Yeah, they will. If they know I have your backing. How's the motel? Yeah, good view, bad coffee. When do we meet the kid? This afternoon. The child psychologist is making it hard for us to get to him. Bloody hell. Does every cop on the island retire to a place like this? His wife had money. He wasn't always by the book, but he was a damn smart cop, taught me a lot. Right. Hi. Doug Bennington, Detective Harding. Bloody hell, Savage, look at you. I'm so sorry. So very, very sorry. Can you remember any evidence that didn't stack up or...? I dunno, anybody who seemed suss? Seems like such a long time ago. We only had, what, two days... Mm-hm. ...before we found his belongings. At which point you just abandoned all your prior theories and accepted it was a drowning? No, we followed the evidence. No, he's right. I should've been more circumspect, especially when we didn't find the body. Have forensics still got his backpack? They're checking. Oh, yeah. We interviewed all the kids, I remember that. He was last seen at lunch break, wasn't it, at Shark Bay? The kids were pretty upset. Some of the parents were in shock, and the teachers weren't much better. I dunno. If you can find me my old notes, that might trigger a few memories. We can't release those to you any more, Doug. Right. That's one of the joys of retirement... you don't have to fix your own stuff-ups. True. If you do remember anything... Yeah, sure. You didn't get it wrong, Jess. This isn't your mistake. See you. Basically, uh, the bus came in... the entrance, which is around the ridge, and then they climbed up to the large kauri, where they had the karakia. Nathan's group continued down here for lunch and then... Well, we don't know. Um. One group went with Billy Brax on the bush walk, and Nathan's group continued along the ridge to view the gannets, but basically nobody saw Nathan past here. And that's Shark Bay? Uh, yeah. Where they found Nathan's backpack? Boss? Boss? This area's closed when the gannets are nesting, so you're trespassing. Has something happened? Ah, no. Just general inquiries. How long have you been looking after the reserve, Mr...? They just call me Gill. Gill, yeah. About 10 year. Mostly voluntary, but I take it seriously. She's a pretty special place. Yeah, she is. So you would've been here when Nathan Baum went missing? The little guy who drowned? Yeah, I was. You were here that day? Well, I opened the gate for the bus, came back in the evening... the place was crawling with cops, so I joined the search party. Why are you asking about this now? Uh, five-year mandatory review before we send that case off to the archives. Do many people come through here, Gill? It's a bit far for most tourists. Uh, used to get the school groups, of course, but not now. Few dog walkers, teenagers making a nuisance... you know. And the odd random. Such as? Night before last... some buggers roaring around in a van. Cut the chain to get in. Saturday night? Yeah, that's right. What sort of van? Hm. It was white, and it was old. Didn't really get a proper look, cos they dipped their lights and took off when they saw me coming. Thank you. Mind if I take this one? Why? Practice. Yeah, all right. I'll be out in a minute. Hey, Jess. Hey. Hey, Billy. Hi! Hey, Conrad. If you wanted to borrow him, I'm sure he'd be up for it. Yeah. Nothing like a dog to help you through a long night. Might just take you up on that offer. Thanks, Billy. Bye, Conrad. Good boy. Take care, Jess. Yeah, yeah. Come on. I don't think he bought the whole five-year-mandatory story. He's a suspicious bugger. Did he have anything new to add? Nah. Stuck to his original statement... dropped the kids at the reserve at 10, came back to pick them up at 2, which is when they realised that Nathan was missing. - Mm. Says all kids look the same to him. Mm-hm. AJ. Come through. Simon. OK. We've made a decision. You can't talk to Nathan. He's not ready. I understand that you wanna protect him, but I give you my word that we won't push him. Your word means nothing. Simon. Just... Now, five years I spent thinking that my son was dead because you people gave up looking for him. And it's five years... five years he was in I don't know what condition. It's five years of having... stuff done to him. Do you not want us to find the guy? What did you say?! I'm sorry, but in case you didn't notice, my son is a basket case! Simon, just shut up! - No. - Shut the fuck up! Look, Chloe. You know, is there anything about Nathan's behaviour that might be a clue? Anything that can help us? Please. Like what? Does he react to anything in particular... good or a bad reaction? Um, he just watches cartoons. Little kid cartoons. I think they make him feel safe. Has he responded to you at all yet? Um, I still haven't been able to touch him. Not yet. He won't let me. Chloe. Look, the best chance that we have of catching this guy is if you let us talk to Nathan, cos right now, he's really the only lead we have. Hi. Hi, Nathan. You can understand what I'm saying, can't you? Good. It's really good how you gave the policeman my card. It's really good. Can you tell me where you got it from? Cos you must have had to hide it, yeah? You had to keep it a secret. Why don't I... Can I...? Tell you what, I'm gonna draw something, all right? I'm not a good a drawer as you are. Yeah? Yeah, there's arms... ...legs. Say this was the person that was hurting you. Maybe you could draw hair on their head, or, uh, make them fatter or skinnier? Sorry. I'm sorry, Nathan. Hey, hey. It's all right, Nathan. Look you don't have to do it. I'll just take the drawing away, see? Look, it's gone. It's... It's just a picture, yeah? Just a picture. It's OK. I'm really sorry, Nathan. That was a really terrible idea. Have a seat. Um, I'm really sorry. Breathe. It's OK. It's OK. It's all right. - Yes? - Hey, boss, where'd you go? Out. Illuminating You call about anything specific, Harding? Yeah, I just wanted to ask you... who found Nathan's backpack? A guy called Billy Brax. He knew better than to retrieve it, so he called it in. I've known him my whole life. He's all right. Right. Right. Thanks. What's happened? She let the cops talk to him. Oh, shit. ♪ There's nowhere to hide. We've got reason to believe that Nathan's kidnapper's holding another child captive. ♪ There's nowhere to hide. How come nobody's said anything? That's something we can all ask ourselves. ♪ The devil's behind you. ♪ He's right by your side. I've had some memory loss since the accident. Do you think we forgot other important things? I've got a job I'd like you to do. Have you ever asked yourself why you were in the car the night you had your accident? Captions by Annie Curtis. Edited by Antony Vlug.
