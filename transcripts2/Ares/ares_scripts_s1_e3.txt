 - And? - All novices are in their new rooms. I spoke with your father. - When? - He called to ask if everything went okay. Too bad that one novice escaped. That wasn't necessary. That won't happen again. I'll get him where he has to be. Hey, remember our plan. Ares comes first. After that... Us. Tsk, tsk. What are you doing? Okay.

 Well, get some. This is not me. My God, who are you, then? Hey, girls. Here you are. You're pretty. - At what time do you have class? - I don't know. I first want to see who's here and if there's any talent among them, if you know what I mean. Do you have your cell phones back already? - Why? - I'd like to call home. Sweetie, you still don't get it, do you? Let's go, they are waiting. - What did he say? - Nothing.

 Okay. Where are you sleeping? We're in the east wing. It's very nice. Is every day like this? Mmm. She's nervous. She has a party this evening. Right, Borms? - A party at some doctor. - A neurosurgeon. Hester de Hoogh? Congratulations. My brother would have killed me if I hadn't gotten that spot. - Is that your brother? - The one on the left. Arnold. Nice guy. Students of Ares, today we welcome... our new recruits. I look with pride at our newest members... who'll start this year. Dear novices, this is just the beginning. You'll see. Each of you gets his own room. You got a complete new wardrobe. We take care of you. We spare no expense. I raise my glass. To our novices. To Ares. To Ares! 14 NEW MESSAGES DAD 44 MISSED CALLS Where are you going? Let me pass, it's an emergency. - An emergency? - Hey... move or I'll move you. What's going on? This novice doesn't know her place. - It's private. - Nothing is private at Ares. Come. Welcome, Jacob. Have a seat. What is this? - Why am I here? - I've heard you have some doubts. Whether you want to stay here or not. I'll ask you some questions. Answer me quickly and honestly and we'll try to figure out what the problem is. - The problem? - And the solution. Shall we give it a try? You can always pack your bag and leave if you want. Deal? Yeah. Yes, okay. Rosa. What did she do? It's bad. Try to clear your mind. Answer as quickly as you can. We're entering the subconscious of Jacob Krudop-Six. We honor the flow, we resist Beal. Jacob... are you afraid of Ares? No. Are you afraid of me? I don't know. Yes. I don't know you that well. What happened? Another suicide attempt. Her wrist again. This time in the kitchen. The floor was covered in blood. You left her alone. Dad... Do you miss your mother? No. - Do you hate your father? - No. - Why are you lying? - I'm not. Jacob... we can only help you if you're honest. Do you feel lonely? - Sometimes. - Do you feel lonely now? - Yes. - Don't you have friends? Just one. Rosa? I'm working again tonight. When we get home, you'll have to help. You can't let us down. You have a duty, do you understand? Why don't you stand up for yourself? - Because I'm afraid. - Of what? - Failure. - Do you have suicidal thoughts? How did you try to commit suicide? Why don't you solve your own problems? - I don't know. - Why don't you accept our help? - I don't know. - Asking for help is a brave thing. Jacob, why are you afraid of Ares? - My father was a member. - Are we your father? - No. - Do you hate him? - Yes. - Why don't you want our help? I don't know. Hi, I'm Carmen. This is terrible. I don't know. I just... I just want... I want to be able to do something myself. Rosa, come with me. I just want it to change. - What do you want to change? - Everything. My parents, school... all the people, everything outside, all the bullshit. I just want to start over. I just want to start over. That's why we're here. Rosa? Rosa. Where do you want to go to? Hey, it's okay. Tell me, what do you want? Hm? To go home. What's wrong? Nothing. Where are you going? You mean, where are we going? You've surprised me. Okay. You can go far. I'm glad you're with us. Yeah. Now Rosa. She'll be on our side after tonight. What do you mean? We know what the parties at De Hoogh are like. - Ladies, welcome. - Thanks. I'm glad to see you. Make yourself at home. Cheers to that. Cheers. She was very modest. No, that's not true. No, it's not. - Hey. - Hey. Nice house. Thank you. Rosa, right? Yes. Rosa Steenwijk. Nice to see you. - I wanted to... - As in the West Frisian Steenwijks? No. From the bank, right? No, he means, do we know your parents? - I don't think so. - Isn't your mother psychotic? - Does it matter? - That's too bad. Does it matter? Of course it matters what your parents do. - It's modern to say... - I've been thinking about our discussion. That's why Ares has existed for such a long time. Because of traditions that are passed on through generations. Well, I'm here for me. Not for my parents. We're all children of our parents. Or are you unique in that sense? - Don't you care about your origins? - Hey... Let's go. Don't mind him. You don't have to be ashamed if your mother... I'm not ashamed of anything. Okay. Enjoy. - Yes, it's bad. - Do you need it? You're pretty straightforward. That Arnold Borms is an asshole. His sister is nice. Maybe she should become vice president. What's her name? Fleur. She's doing an internship with you. Ah. I'm not that good with names. Oh. Do you have trouble sleeping? It's for my nerves. You can't have those in my profession. They think we're a kind of... I don't know. That we can do anything and feel nothing. Like a kind of superhuman. We're superhumans without emotions. Don't tell anyone. They all think I'm unethical. Sometimes you have to break the rules to get a breakthrough. - Who said that? - I did. Don't worry, Rosa. You'll be fine. - Jacob. - Hey. I'll be right there. I've warned you. - Yet you show up here. - I know. No. - Look at me. Okay? - Yes. Yes. Hey! Look at me. Okay? I'm sorry, I'll leave, okay? Hey. What's wrong with your fingers? What are you doing? Rosa. Where were you? I've looked everywhere for you. Do you know Machteld? Machteld and I drove everybody in Saint-Tropez crazy last year. And she has the best pills. Hmm? Go on. - No, thanks. - Yes. - Go ahead. - Okay. Well done. I'll see you soon. Can I talk to you? - What? - Can I please talk to you? Please... Come, lie down. Why are you here? Have you seen Rosa? We have to get out of here. Now. Jesus, Jacob. Are you okay? - No, no, nothing is okay. - What's going on? I saw something last night. Something underneath Ares. We were all messed up last night, Jacob. I've also seen things. Where is she? Where is Rosa? Tell me. Tell me! - You have to tell me. You have to help me. - I don't know. Sweetie? Shall we go? Yes. - Hey. - Hey. - Are you still here? - Yes, with... I don't mind. - Take a nice shower. - Okay. - I'll see you soon. - Thanks. Jacob?
