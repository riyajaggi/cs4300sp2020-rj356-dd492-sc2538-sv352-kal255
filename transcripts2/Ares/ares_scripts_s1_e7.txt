 Yes? With her mother? How long were they there? Call me when they're back at Ares. Are you awake? You're scared. I can smell it. Another chosen one has died. A boy. Twenty-two years old. Innocent. You're no longer innocent.

 You're so sensitive, my boy. That Roos is angry. She should be the one on the throne. New blood. She's not ready for that. You don't decide that. Maurits... you'll do what you have to do... to survive. Which is? Adapt to the times. Think about it, Steenwijk. What do you want to do? We have to be careful. Leave it to me, Steenwijk.

 Rosa! Hey, you're back? Yes. Have you seen Jacob? No. Not for hours. I thought he was with you. - I'm going to my room. - Okay. She's with me. Is that right? Yes. What's this for? Orders from above. The alumni are dining here this evening. Which ones? All of them. They will choose a new candidate. I hope I'm not hanging from a beam tomorrow. Like you will be president, idiot. She's back. And she pretends like nothing is going on. Don't just let that happen. Poor thing. Are you okay? I'm almost there. I can feel it. They tried to keep it from us. But it called me. It asked me for help. I'll set it free this evening. Do you mean Beal? This evening we will set you free, Beal. Jacob... we're going home. Did they send you to get me? - Hm? - No. What? Nobody sent me. Let's leave this place together. Jacob. Jacob! What are you doing? What's wrong? Thank you, Leopold. We'll see you this evening. Okay. Bye. That was the last one. Everybody will be there. They all want to know who it'll be. I'm also curious about that. It's crucial that the next president is the right one. Borms only made her... angrier. According to custom, Roderick van Hal is the next candidate. When the dike broke in 1953, 1836 deaths, thousands of animals and tens of thousands of houses... 200,000 hectares of land... everything and everybody underwater. Do you know why? Why? Because we didn't think ahead. We didn't adapt to our times. It's getting more restless by the day. Or do you think those suicides are a coincidence? It's my job to calm it down before it gets out of control. That's our job. You want to give the keys to the one outsider. If you really want it to be a woman... let it be one from the families. Who else? Before you say something... I've been in the senate for over a year. You chose Joost over me. You chose Arnold Borms over me. I won't let a novice get chosen before me. Think, Maurits. Dad, you have to listen to me. I know there's a test beforehand. I'm ready for it. More than she is. Dad, I'm talking to you. Okay. Fine. Go back to Ares. We'll prepare everything. Okay. Great. You're right, we keep it within the families. Where are you going? Running away? Bye, Fleur. What's this, Steenwijk? Where is Carmen? You'll have to deal with me. Where are you going? Hmm? I'm very sorry about what happened to Arnold. You're a killer. My brother didn't commit suicide. Everything points to you. What should we think of you, Steenwijk? Van Hal claims she already offers. He saw her in the baptizing room. You're already offering? As a novice? I'm going home. You are home. Don't look so serious. Come. We're in a hurry. Do you... have any fatherly advice... beforehand? We're searching for... the purest thing inside of you. A custom-made test. Different for everyone. Personal for everyone. Kill it, Carmen. You're kidding, right? It's a joke, isn't it, Dad? This is... the most important moment in your life. We all had to do this. No... The first woman of our society. Do it, Carmen. You'll have to. Do it. Do it! There are boys in the senate we can approach. Maurits, everybody is on their way. All of them. Right. Let's go and welcome them. Sit down. Okay, show us what you can. Open her mouth. Hold her well. Nothing. See? You know what to do. She confessed. Joost, Hester de Hoogh, Arnold. You're lying. She killed all three of them. Let her solve it herself. - No... - My brother hated people like you. Rosa! Hey! Stop! Don't do it. Not you. Tonight we'll set you free, Beal. I'm talking on behalf of Beal. You are all dying. Calm down. Hold him. Stay calm. Take him. Stay calm.
