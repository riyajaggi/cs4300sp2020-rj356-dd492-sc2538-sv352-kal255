 I don't feel good. Are you okay? Lean forward. - Are you okay? - I don't like it. "One of you doesn't belong here. You have two minutes to decide who has to leave Ares now. Good luck." That's obvious. I'll go. I'm serious. I just want to go home. That's okay. It's solved, isn't it?

 Bunch of idiots. Your father, oil. Yours, pharmaceutical. And I'm sure your family deals in weapons. I know everybody, except you. So, get out. Go away. Why don't we choose you? New money, a rat face. I wouldn't miss you. My cousin was president for four years. You can only be the president of Ares for two years. My brother is in the senate. Back to you. Just calm down. It's a test. Initiations are always about solidarity.

 It's a test to see if we stand up for each other. You really don't know what Ares is. We all stay. None of us leave. Christiaan Dhondt. Tell Beal your biggest secret. It was dark. The lights of my car were still off. Um... before I knew it, somebody crossed the street and... She died before anybody could help her. We don't judge each other at Ares. Ares thanks you for your honesty. Jacob Krudop-Six. Your family has a long history with this society. We expected a lot from you. Loyalty, above all. I... - I don't know... - You had a task. A month ago, we told you to recruit somebody for us. It didn't seem that difficult, considering your personal connection with this novice. But you've failed. Even more, you've done everything you could to keep her away from us. She doesn't belong here. Next time an elder asks you to do something, don't fail, novice Krudop-Six. Rosa Steenwijk. Can you tell us why novice Krudop-Six failed to ask you to join us? Maybe he's ashamed of you? Or himself. Himself? Yes, I think so. It's the first time I heard the name "Krudop-Six." I know him as Jacob Wessels. Maybe he's ashamed of your origin. Why is that, novice? Because I'm not from a rich family? Is that it? Because my mother is crazy. Because my father works the night shift. I'm not lying about my origins. And at Ares we don't betray our friends, novice. You came to us voluntarily. Why? What can you offer us, novice? Why would we let you join? I didn't even know you existed until yesterday. But I'm not ashamed of anything. So, if you want me... here I am. And if not... fine by me. I'm used to it. Don't be petty. A good doctor is always useful. Ares thanks you for your honesty. Form a circle around your president. Novices of Ares, show your allegiance through your words, your actions... - and your body. - Wait. There's a novice missing. What are you doing? Come with me. Let's go. Search over there. There's always somebody who can't handle it. Are you okay? Don't you know him? I thought I did. Are you coming? Let's go. What happens if I don't? Okay, well... But... let me ask you, where would you like to go? Home. Jacob, this is your home now. This is your new home. We are your family. Only if you want to. We're not forcing you into anything. I get it. It's very confronting. You just got here, you get a mask put on, all those people... An initiation can be very exciting. You know it's all an act, don't you? A tradition. Don't forget that... the fact that you're here... is a privilege. You're a Krudop-Six. Just like your father and brothers. You belong here. Here... This is who you are. We have to separate the wheat from the chaff, don't we? And you are the... - Wheat? - Wheat. Exactly. Great guy. Keep it in mind, you're a winner. Let's go. We found him! Okay, Jacob... Rosa, come with me, now. Wait. Wait a second. What are we doing, exactly? We've lost Jacob. For real. I'm hoping that he'll show himself when he hears your voice. Is this a test? Is this a... search for Jacob Wessels, Krudop-Six? No, Rosa. I'm serious. I need your help. Call him. Go on. Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! And? Anything? No. Search the west wing and send a group to the attics. - Jacob! - Great, the attics. Steenwijk! Jacob! Jacob! Breathe. Breathe, breathe. That's it. Wessels is my mother's last name. Why...? You must have your reasons to lie about your last name. I'm sorry. Why are you still here? Because they might find me good enough. I don't want this. I decide on my own what's good for me or not. Do you understand, Wessels? I'll manage. They can't go anywhere. Carmen? I'm sorry. You know how to fix this. I've found him. Take them, Roderick. Novices of Ares... show your allegiance through words... your actions, and bear the symbol with the others. Beal sees you. On your knees. Go on. Ah. Don't do it, Arnold. Keep still. Still. Rosa. Congratulations and welcome. Thanks. Jacob. Congratulations. Oh. Hi. We're in, Steenwijk. - Yes. - We did it. - Yes. Yes. - We've made it. - Thanks. - Okay. We did it. Hey... What a surprise. Did you know that our initiation ritual is older than Ares itself? No, I didn't know that. And? Do we have 12 new disciples? Yes, everything went fine. No problems. Joost, now that you're on our level, I demand absolute honesty. How mad was it? There was some noise from downstairs. But you were right, the ritual helped a lot. Yes. As long as we keep feeding it, we'll be fine. - How did the girl do? - Well. Very well. Congratulations with your first initiation, Mr. President.
