 Guys. Okay, welcome. I understand that this is difficult. It just happened. What happened? It seemed a great party. There were no incidents or anything. Also no indication that he would... No suicide note? No. Who of you saw him last? I was somewhere else. Were there drugs involved? I didn't see him take anything, maybe you did.

 What goes on inside somebody's mind at that moment... I'm afraid we'll never know why he did it. Mmm. What? Okay, how are we going to handle this? Keep it a secret from our members. - Especially the students. - And the parents. They cannot know that there was another suicide. We keep it a secret. For their own good. Henry? Take care of your sister. His parents are on their way. They want to see the body. Roderick. You're the vice president. Any ideas? Uh... An accident. Go on. Um... He fell down the stairs. Broke his neck. There were witnesses. Wait a second, that means it still happened in my house. That's a problem. It is. - Yes. - Okay, that won't work. Jacob, I haven't heard you yet. What do you think? An accident? - It wasn't an accident. - What? Mr. Zwanenburg is trying to help you. You were very intoxicated and it happened at a very inconvenient location. Exactly. How do we deal with it? We saw him leave alive. Isn't that what you want to hear? It means he died somewhere else. We'll have to lie. That's what this is about. We want a better reality for everybody, Rosa. Okay. An accident. It has to be done fast, unfortunately. Don't you have people for that? We'll do this together, for Joost. Rosa. What do you suggest? He was in a severe car accident. What kind of injuries does that give you? Aren't you a doctor? Come on. Here? On his chest? Where? Um... injuries to the face. His chest. Broken bones. His face. On his head. Right? Ugh! Your turn, Ro. His parents are coming. I know. Go ahead. Ro, stop, stop. I want the novice to finish it. My condolences. My condolences. My condolences. Thank you. Once again, Lilian, Dolf... it's sad that we have to meet under these circumstances. The emptiness Joost leaves behind is immense. Especially for the ones that knew him the best. But we will get through this together. Lilian, Dolf, Carmen... Ares is there for you. It goes without saying that all of us... will raise our glass to toast to his accomplishments and his life. Wait. Lilian... I want to know. How did it happen? What happened to my son? This is not the moment to violate the intimate trust we have at Ares. It was an accident. I was there. Joost was... intoxicated, so he wanted to walk home. He staggered across the street and... I tried to stop him, but when he crossed the street... he got hit by a truck. - He went under the wheels. - He died instantly. Did he feel any pain? - No. - No. Let's raise our glass... to the life of Joost van Moerland. He was our president. He fulfilled that task very well. Joost always gave it his all. He put his own needs aside for the greater good. He worked hard for our values and defended our beliefs. He guarded our future. Leaders like Joost are the reason our society has been so strong for centuries. That it can live on. The sacrifices they make... are an example for all of us. And in their shadow, we follow their example. To Ares. To Ares. And to Joost. A loved one... a friend... a leader. Rosa. Thank you... for, uh... what you did. Yes. I'm impressed. You're good. I'd like to thank you... - on behalf of Ares. - Mm. Thank you. Don't think I did it for free. You want something in return? Absolutely. How's your hand? Show me. What are you doing? - Come on, show me. - What have you done? Rosa, we have to leave. You have to leave. Jacob, come on. When we get to Ares, we grab our stuff and leave. Then what? I have to go back home? Easy to say for somebody with a silver spoon in his mouth. Roos... Jacob Krudop-Six. I won't throw away the chance of a lifetime just because you're jealous of me. Hey... Hey, Fleur. Are you okay? Hester doesn't want me anymore... as her assistant. She just told me. She said... But your brother is president now. There will be plenty of opportunities for you, right? She told me that you'll replace me. So? The best one wins. Fucking bitch. What's wrong with you? I don't feel so good. Are you kidding me? What's happening to me? Go on. Go on. Let it come, don't stop it. Let it all out. You're doing great. Well done. Good job. Ah... What is this? No. Leave it. How are you feeling? Fine. Jacob! Are you okay? I'm proud of you, man. I didn't expect you to do it, but... I admit I was wrong. Come. Shake your new president's hand... novice. Are you sure? Go on. I won't hurt you. That time in the kitchen was necessary... Hello? This is, uh... This isn't funny. I've waited so long for you. Arnold! Let me go! You've shown Ares... the ultimate trust. Beal is ready to take your sins. Arnold Borms... offer your soul... to Beal. Fuck! Subtitle translation by Willem Siers
