 The Assets (2014–…): Season 1, Episode 8 - Avenger - full transcript 
 In the series finale, despite the task force being fully convinced of Ames' guilt, Sandy seeks more definitive proof to convince the Justice Department to proceed with their own investigation. As the hunt closes in on Ames, Sandy's commitment to the job pushes her husband's patience and commitment to the brink. After Ames is finally caught and brought to justice, he mulls over a major decision--to go down defiantly or to confess and protect his wife and child.

 I don't want to wake up and find
another five years have gone by
 And we are no closer
to finding the traitor.
 Previously on "the assets"...
 Good night, sandy.
 Rick ames --
the number-one suspect.
 Everyone here
must agree.
 There'll be a series
of routine security interviews
 With about
a dozen case officers.
 Mitch: If you were the spy,
how would you do it?
 That's just not something
I've ever r-really considered.
 His new house --
they paid in cash.
 Examiner: He passed.
 Or he's the best liar
I've ever seen.
 Arthur: We all
have to keep digging.
 Austin:
It's not enough.
 To get a federal warrant
to surveil aldrich ames,
 To turn his life upside down,
the dci is going to need
 Conclusive proof
that he's a mole.
 There's too much conjecture
in this document.
 Every deposit ames made
at his bank
 Was preceded by one day
by a meeting
 With a known kgb agent
at the russian embassy.
 Circumstantial evidence.
 And forget about
trying to arrest him.
 That is miles away.
 Hey, I have an idea.
 How about we take ames
up to the seventh floor
 And have him tell the dci in
person that he's the traitor?!
 Would that be enough?!
Arthur: Sandy!
 I think what she's saying
 Is this is pretty much
slam-dunk stuff.
 Not slam-dunk enough.
 He's going to
get away with it!
 After all these years,
we're gonna lose him!
 I have an appointment.
 [ beeping ]
hey.
 He contacted u.S. Embassy staff
24 hours ago.
 He says he has intelligence
on our mole.
 Credible intelligence?
 He says he has hard proof
and a name.
 We agreed
to meet him in berlin.
 He'll need to be vetted
if it's gonna be
 Solid enough
to get us a warrant.
 Which is why you'll be taking
the next flight out.
 Here's your credentials
and your cover.
 You'll debrief him at a hotel
in prenzlauer berg.
 A case officer
will meet you there.
 You're back in the field,
grimes.
 Laura? Hi.
 Bring him in
through the back entrance.
 Station an officer
in front
 And another
in the alley behind the hotel.
 We can't be too careful.
 There's still a lot
of russian intelligence agents
 Roaming the old parts
of east berlin.
 This runs a direct
wireless connection.
 I'll ask the questions.
You relay them to the subject.
 If he's a dangle, we cannot let
him or the russians know
 Who's doing the interrogating
or who we're after.
 So you're my buffer.
Do you speak russian?
 Yes.
Good.
 His code name
is gt-avenger,
 But you'll address him
as aleksandr.
 Got it?
Yes, ms. Grimes.
 Oh [chuckles] please,
call me sandy.
 [ gate creaks ]
 Here.
 He's here.
He's coming in.
 Come on.
 Make him feel comfortable.
 Ask him about his trip.
You're his friend.
 You're so happy he's here.
 It's when I leave,
that worries me.
 We'll take care of you.
We will spare no expense...
 ...To make sure
you are protected.
 That is
our top priority.
 Was it your top priority
for dmitry polyakov?
 Yes, actually, it was.
 We could have moved him out
 Of the soviet union
any number of times...
 ...But he always
refused us.
 He loved russia -- wanted to
be buried in russian soil.
 His choice. Not ours.
 L-let's talk about
why he was compromised.
 You have information
for us about a mole?
 Why give it to us now
after all these years?
 The kgb has changed.
 It's broke --
all of russia is broke.
 We already have a german
bank account set up for you...
 ...If you agree
to work with us.
 I'll want it in dollars --
a lot of dollars.
 But we need to hear
what you have to tell us first.
 Wait it out. Let him stew.
 Your mole works
in s.E. Division.
 Well-placed
in counterintelligence.
 How do you know?
 I've seen the files
at the svr in yasenevo.
 How long
has he worked for you?
 Since 1985.
 He killed varenik...
And martynov...
 Poleshchuk,
tolkachev, polyakov.
 Enough.
 I know his name.
 Before you give us his name,
we will need...
 ...Proof -- something we can use
in an american court of law.
 I have this proof.
 But it's still too dangerous
for me to tell you.
 We can make you rich...
 ...And safe.
 But we'll need
the proof in our hands.
 [ sighs ]
 A c.I.A. Cable --
restricted traffic --
 About the prime minister
of uzbekistan
 From your rome embassy.
 It wound up
in our offices.
 Slugged only to the director
of central intelligence...
 And...
 ...Aldrich ames.
 [ sighs ]
 It's real.
 [ jet engine roars ]
 The only people who have
retrieval privileges
 To this particular cable
were the dci and rick ames.
 No one else could have
laid their hands on it,
 And yet the russians
have it,
 Which means one of these two men
gave it to them.
 Share it with the fbi
and justice.
 The foreign intelligence
surveillance court.
 All right? Let's go
get ourselves a warrant.
 Great! Thank you.
 You did great.
Good work.
 [ indistinct conversation ]
 Come on. In you go.
 Ohh.
 Watch your hands.
 [ engine turns over ]
 [ engine turns over ]
 [ engine shuts off ]
 Jim: There's microphones
in every corner.
 Nothing he says
will escape us.
 But now we'd like
to wire his office.
 Arthur:
Are you kidding me?!
 Bugs? So the fbi can listen
inside the c.I.A.?!
 Upstairs
will never agree!
 They already
gave it the go-ahead.
 No, no, no.
This ain't happening.
 There are lines
you don't cross.
 Art, we can't
collect evidence.
 I know you know that
as well as I do.
 Only the bureau can.
That's the law.
 Even inside the c.I.A.?
That is right.
 Look, this is our independence
and our building.
 The old rules
don't apply anymore.
 Ames changed everything.
 [ breathing heavily ]
 [ chair scrapes ]
 [ breathing heavily ]
 He's acting so strangely.
 I mean,
is -- is he nervous?
 Do you think
he suspects something?
 Rick: Shaking.
 Stop.
 Sandy:
We need to keep watching.
 I'll take
the first shift.
 Okay.
 Fbi cameras
inside the c.I.A.
 Rosario: You know she needs
whatever we can send her.
 It's just not enough.
 How many more times
have I got to tell
 You and your mother?
 Things have changed!
 They've moved me.
 I'm in
counter-narcotics now.
 They put you in that job
because they hate you.
 They don't hate me.
 And there is nothing wrong
with the job.
 It's just not a very lucrative
posting for you is all!
 Have you written
them lately? Huh?
 Have you asked
for more money?
 Look, this is
none of your business.
 None of my business?
No.
 What about those markers?
Have you made them?
 She's talking about
dead-drop markers.
 Then she knows
he's a spy.
 She knows everything!
 Makes sense.
 All of a sudden, the guy's
a freaking millionaire.
 How could she not know?
 Um, his son, paul,
is 5.
 They go to jail, and he won't
have a father or a mother.
 That's your problem.
Rick, please listen to me!
 Aldrich: You look...
 [ camera shutter clicks ]
 [ door opens ]
 Chinese restaurant?
Really?
 Yeah, it's neutral ground
for all three organizations.
 It took us three days to agree
to meet in a restaurant.
 It took us another
three days to agree on chinese.
 [ laughs ]
 Good evening.
Man: Yes.
 Doug chen with justice.
 Hi. Sandy grimes.
 Doug chen. Justice. Okay.
Sandy grimes.
 Gentlemen.
[ sighs ]
 Okay.
Let's get this started.
 Ames made
a dead-drop mark last night,
 And everyone at this table
knows that means
 He'll either be collecting
or dropping intelligence
 For his russian handlers.
 So what's the plan?
 We'll have one team
at his house,
 One on military road, and
another at north 26th street.
 All possible exit routes.
 We'll also have a tail beacon
on his car, in case he loses us.
 We've been surveilling him
for three weeks now,
 And ames has yet
to leave the house before 8:30.
 We'll never be more
than 30 seconds away from him.
 And when we catch him
in the act, game's over.
 Done deal.
 [ engine turns over ]
 Fields:
Where's his jag?
 He's not here.
 It's just his wife's car!
 Tail team 1, tail team 2,
any sign of nightmover?
 Repeat, any sign
of nightmover? Over.
 Man: Tail 1. No sign.
 Woman:
Tail 2. Negative. Over.
 Yeah. O'neill.
 This is really good.
 [ sighs ]
 Yeah.
 I'll let them know.
 What happened?
 [ sighs ]
that was the fbi.
 Ames left early. They didn't
have a team on him yet.
 So if he made a dead drop,
nobody saw him.
 How is that
even possible?
 Wasn't surveillance
supposed to be 24/7?
 I don't know.
These things happen.
 No operation
runs perfectly.
 Well, there's a tail beacon
on his car, right?
 And the beeper would tell us
where his car is.
 Jane, his car
is in our parking lot.
 [ beeping, lock clicks ]
 He's at work.
 Okay, how do we get him
to contact his handlers again?
 Well,
he's counter-narcotics.
 Not sure they care
about that anymore.
 But he's still in the c.I.A.,
and that's precious to them.
 The russians will run him
till he's dead.
 We could make him
valuable again.
How so?
 Tell him he's up
for a new job --
 That would certainly give them
reason to make contact again.
 Just act normal.
 "normal"
is I want to kill him.
 Deep breath, okay?
 You're just doing your job,
and your job is to catch a mole.
 You can do this.
 Okay.
 Hey, rick.
 Good morning, sandy.
 How's things?
 Well, you know,
uh, kelly's a senior now.
 All that
high-school craziness.
 Hmm.
She's never home.
 You?
 Well, I'm...
 Got to say you fall in love
with your kids fast.
 Guess it,
uh...Sneaks up on you.
 Uh,
you hear the rumor?
 No, what rumor?
 They're looking for a new head
of russia house.
 Your name got floated.
 No. Really?
 Yeah, I mean, it's just a rumor,
but nice job if you can land it.
 Yeah.
 See you.
Okay, okay.
 See you later.
 Hoffman: We've practiced this
a dozen times.
 In and out in 22 seconds.
Not a sound.
 If even a dog barks,
 Ames will look out the window
and make us.
 And if he makes us,
 He'll destroy every shred
of evidence he's got.
 And we will never convict.
 Once you've
gone through something,
 Develop your own system,
okay?
 If you've seen it,
put it aside to the left.
 Don't throw it
right back in the pile
 Because we don't want to be
 Duplicating our efforts here,
all right?
 And if you have
anything with writing,
 Keep the writing things
on the side.
 Don't get rid of them.
Don't put them back on the pile.
 [ indistinct whispering ]
 I'll send the tape
on Thursday.
 [ indistinct conversation ]
 Okay.
Hi. Sorry.
 There's a counter-narcotics
conference in moscow.
 It starts Thursday.
I leave tomorrow.
 Can you expedite that
with travel?
 Sure. Sure. You bet.
 Great.
 Much appreciated.
 [ beeping ]
 We absolutely cannot let him
leave the country.
 But if we stop his trip,
he'll know something's up.
 We've already bugged his office
and dangled jobs.
 He's beginning to suspect.
 Can we arrest him?
 Take our chances
in court?
 I don't think
we have enough to convict.
 Not yet.
 We will get him.
I promise you we will get him.
 Hey, boss, I think
I got something here.
 All right.
 Oh, yeah.
 Get over here, guys.
 Mitch: He didn't even shred it.
He just tore it up.
 Jeanne: Good god.
 What did justice say?
Can we make an arrest?
 First thing
tomorrow morning.
 [ sighs ]
 Okay, everybody,
let's call it a night.
 Art, I am not leaving
this building
 Till I know
that he's in handcuffs.
 All right.
 Good night.
 [ indistinct conversation ]
 Do you
have everything?
 Yep, I think so.
Good.
 That's all I need.
 All right.
 Come on, little boy.
 [ laughs ]
ohh!
 All right.
All right.
 I'm gonna miss you
very much.
 Come here.
[ grunts ]
 All right.
Smile!
 [ camera shutter clicks ]
beautiful. Another one?
 [ camera shutter clicks ]
 Perfect.
 Is that nice?
Mm-hmm.
 I'll miss you very much.
 Go on.
 Go on.
 Off you go.
Mm.
 Have a nice trip.
Love you.
 You, too.
 Bye.
 Paul: Bye!
 Bye, paul.
 Bye.
 Love you.
 [ smooches ]
 [ horn blares ]
 [ tires screeching ]
 Fbi! Aldrich ames,
you're under arrest!
 Get out of the car with your
hands above your head!
 [ knock on door ]
fbi. Open up.
 Yes?
Rosario ames?
 Yes.
Federal agents.
 You're under arrest
for treason.
 What?! No! No!
 No! You can't do this!
 You've got the wrong guy.
 You've got the wrong guy.
 You've got...
The wrong guy.
 Please! Please!
 What about my son?!
You can't do this!
 Paul!
 [ telephone ringing ]
 O'neill.
 Got him!
 Yes!
[ clapping ]
 Oh, congratulations,
jeanne.
 Congratulations,
grimes.
 You did good.
 Yes.
 [ indistinct conversations ]
 Jeanne: Ohh!
 [ claps ]
how about that?!
 [ indistinct conversations ]
 [ beeping, lock clicks ]
 [ knock on door ]
 [ chains jingling ]
 [ door closes ]
 Hoffman: We've been
watching you for awhile.
 Quite a while.
 Four weeks of conversation,
phone calls....
 Pretty much got you
wall to wall, rick.
 Frozen all your assets.
 All you've got
is the shirt on your back.
 So what we'd like
is a full confession --
 Names, dates, figures --
so we can all move on, rick,
 Because this is
an open-and-shut case.
 I want a lawyer.
 [ cheers and applause ]
 Austin:
He lawyered up.
 The fbi froze his bank account,
so he'll get a public defender.
 There's enough
for a conviction, right,
 If this goes to trial?
 But we want
his cooperation.
 We want him talking.
We want details.
 Nine years of spying leaves
a lot of unanswered questions.
 We need to start
plugging holes fast.
 Use his family --
his son.
 He'll tell you everything.
 Rosario: Did you talk
to the russians today?
 Did you ask
for more money, rick?
 They need to pay you more.
 You give them good information,
but they don't pay you enough.
 [ sighs]
 Through the pipe for them --
another marker.
 Just be careful so no one sees.
 And then ask them
to give you more.
 We deserve it!
 [ click ]
 Chen: Without your
cooperation, rick...
 We ask for life
without parole.
 She dies an old lady
in solitary confinement.
 And your son, paul,
never sees
 His father or his mother
again in his life.
 And if I cooperate?
 She gets five years,
and then we deport her.
 The kid lives with his
grandparents until she gets out.
 I'll tell you
whatever you want to know.
 Rick: Wait.
 Wait, wait, wait!
 Sorry.
 [ knock on door ]
hey.
 Well [sighs]
he confessed.
 He said he'll tell us
everything.
 Thanks for telling me.
 Oh, one more thing.
 The agency is gonna
want to put a face on this
 With the press
and the public.
 We've got some
damage control to do.
 It was a team effort,
all right?
 I was just part --
get ready
to be on television.
 [ sighs ]
 [ indistinct talking over p.A. ]
 Gary, we're gonna
miss the meeting.
 Hey, just give me
a sec, okay?
 [ telephone rings ]
 Hello?
 Gary: Oh, hey, it's me.
What's up?
 Been out all morning.
You wouldn't believe where.
 Sandy, uh, I just landed.
I'm late for a meeting.
 Is this important?
 I wanted to tell you.
Maybe watch the news.
 News? Seriously?
 Yeah, when I get
to the hotel, hmm?
 Okay. Sure.
I love you.
 I love you, too.
Got to go.
 Announcer: From abc...
 [ chuckles ]
...This is "world news tonight"
with peter jennings,
 Reporting tonight
from washington.
 Jennings: Good evening. We begin
tonight with a spy story.
 A senior officer
in the c.I.A. --
 A man who was once in charge
of keeping russian agents
 From spying on the u.S.
Is accused of spying for them,
 In other words
of being a double agent
 On the payroll of the c.I.A.
And the kgb.
 We learned today
that aldrich ames and his wife
 Were arrested yesterday.
 The justice department
says they've been
 Secretly working
for the russians since 1985,
 Selling information to moscow
and living a life of luxury
 What? What is it?
Rob: Peter, we have one of
the c.I.A. Officers involved...
 I know that guy.
...In the hunt
for aldrich james
 With us here in our
washington d.C. Studios.
 Sandy grimes
worked side by side
 With aldrich ames
for many years in the c.I.A.
 Sandy, when did you suspect
mr. Ames was a soviet spy?
 Hey. Is that your sandy?
Sandy: We had our suspicions
for awhile...
 Yeah.
...But we needed hard evidence
to make an arrest.
 That's my wife.
That's classified
for the moment.
 It will be unsealed in court,
but it was pretty damning.
 There was no doubt that he was
a mole spying for the kgb.
 I didn't know your wife
worked for the c.I.A.
He was employed
by the russians.
 But the goal was
to keep him in the dark
 Until we could
make an arrest.
Yeah, that's...
What she does.
 It wasn't easy,
but we had a dedicated team,
 Until we found the traitor
inside the agency.
 She works for the c.I.A.
 [ birds chirping ]
 When's this thing
gonna start?
 We're waiting
for two more participants.
 [ knock on door ]
 Hoffman: You know officers
vertefeuille and grimes.
 Hello, aldrich.
 Hello.
 [ click ]
 All right, let's start
at the beginning.
 I'd like to hear about
every secret you passed,
 Every dollar you were paid,
and every asset you killed.
 Poleshchuk,
martynov, varenik...
 Tolkachev, vasiliev...
 Smirtonin, motorin...
 Pikazov, yuzhin...
 ...And polyakov.
 Every single one.
 Was it hard...
Seeing him like that...
 In prison, handcuffed?
 No, it was --
it was a relief.
 I think I'm gonna stay in bed
for two weeks straight.
 Mind if I join you?
 [ chuckles ]
hmm.
 I can't think of anything
more wonderful.
 All those years...
 ...You couldn't tell me.
 You couldn't tell anyone.
 I'm so proud of you,
sandy.
 You are my hero.
 I was talking to jeanne.
 And we were
thinking this.
 This might be crazy,
but we were thinking
 We might write a book
about it all.
 [ chuckles ]
 Yeah, I like that --
 "mom...Spy...Author."
 Sandy: Thank you.
 Hi. Who should
I make it out to?
 How much longer
do we have to do this?
 My hand
is getting cramped up.
 Fame is a cruel
taskmaster.
 Maybe I was better
in the back room.
 You were great
in the back room.
 Thank you.
 There you go.
 Hello.
 [ russian accent ] hi.
 Who would you like to make
the dedication out to?
 Uh, not here, please.
 Could you sign
this picture, please?
 And make it out
for my grandfather --
 Dmitry polyakov.
 We moved here
after the wall fell.
 I thank you.
 I thank you
for everything you did.
 My grandfather thanks you.
 [ sobbing ]
 Boy: They're building
a new playground.
Woman: Yes.
 And now it's finished.
