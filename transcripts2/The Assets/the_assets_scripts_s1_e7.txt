 The Assets (2014–…): Season 1, Episode 7 - The Straw Poll - full transcript 
 After the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of communism, the CIA task force still remains on the hunt for the cause of the assets' compromise. Sandy becomes convinced that Ames is the most likely suspect but has a difficult time convincing the rest of the task force. After living glamorously in Rome, Ames finds it increasingly difficult to maintain that lifestyle and keep his identity hidden.

 I want a million dollars.
Previously on "the assets"...
 Viktor: If you control
your body, you control the test.
 You passed.
Enjoy Italy.
 You are charged
with espionage.
 Gt top hat
has been compromised.
 [ groans ]
sandy: I quit.
 I'm worn out.
And heartbroken.
 If I was to reopen
the investigation
 Into the asset losses,
would you stay for that?
 Whatever you decide,
don't leave the job half done.
 Consider my resignation
withdrawn.
 I know they're still here,
and I'm gonna get the bastard.
 Jennings: It was hard to
believe, and it was all so real.
 We knew the party boss
erich honecker was in trouble.
 Mikhail gorbachev was here,
 Making it clear
that east germany had to change.
 But four weeks ago,
we didn't have the vaguest idea
 That the wall
would be breached so quickly,
 And nor did most governments.
 Tonight, in this city,
on both sides of that wall,
 You can feel the power
of a people's revolution.
 The idea of freedom
is as powerful here now
 As it is anywhere
or has been at anytime.
 [ jet engine roars ]
 [ tires screech ]
 Aldrich:
Good to be home.
 Well,
I'm gonna miss rome.
 Well, we're gonna make it
just as nice here.
 Won't we, paul? Huh?
 Welcome to america,
baby.
 Gonna see a new house
on Tuesday.
 I spoke with the realtor.
Oh, really?
 Half a million bucks.
You're gonna like it.
 I like that.
 Sandy: We've been at this hunt
a long time now,
 We're all terribly frustrated
by the lack of progress.
 To that end,
jeanne and I have been talking
 And we'd like to
try an experiment.
 As you know, jeanne asked
the office of security
 To draw up a list of names
of everyone
 Who had access to our
compromised assets' information.
 I went through that list.
 I did a lot of pruning,
and I got it down to 160 names.
 Then I made some deductions
and narrowed the list further.
 Arthur:
What kind of deductions?
 I eliminated
people I believe
 Would never
betray their country.
 You're kidding me,
right?
 A-are you comfortable
with this?
 It's a starting point.
Starting point.
 Jim, you're fbi liaison.
You want to chime in?
 The bureau is comfortable
 With a certain amount
of speculation,
 Provided it's immediately
backed up with evidence.
 Subjective?
Well, that's putting it mildly.
 We can't rule people out
because of your conjecture.
 We have to start
someplace.
 Our new house!
 This just gives us
a quicker way in.
 We want to
conduct a straw poll.
 Go through all these names,
 Pick five you think
we should focus on,
 And rank them
from highest to lowest.
 Arthur: Highest to lowest what?
Um, fashion sense?
 Possibility
of being the traitor.
 We just want to take
the temperature of the room.
 Then I would like
to assign numerical values
 To everyone's choices --
 Six points for your
most-worried pick...
 Rosario!
 ...Five points for your
second-most worried pick,
 Et cetera.
 And maybe the results
will surprise us.
 Let's get on it.
 As you can see,
 There are a lot of names
on people's lists,
 But the only person
who made it
 Onto almost everyone's list
was rick ames.
 I was the only person
who put him on top.
 You guys, you gave him a two,
a three, a four, or a nothing.
 But when you
add numerical values
 To everyone's vote
and re-rank,
 He becomes
the number-one suspect.
 Sandy, are you serious?
Do you really think --
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We have to be very careful here.
 This isn't a leap of logic.
It makes perfect sense.
 I just want to take his name
up to the seventh floor
 So we can get the go-ahead
to intensify the probe.
 Before we take any name
to the dci,
 Everyone
here must agree.
 We must have complete consensus
he's our number-one suspect.
 Then and only then will
we tear someone's life apart.
 All right. Let's get
out of here for the weekend.
 Hey, jeanne, wait up.
 You didn't back me
in there.
 Because I didn't agree
with you.
 You want to find the mole.
I want to find the mole.
 We're on the same side,
so we got to dig into ames.
And every other suspect.
 We polygraph
and interview them all.
 But why? He's the --
because we don't know
it's ames.
 That's why.
 You're overreaching, sandy.
Facts, not emotions.
 Well, the facts are
he scored the highest, remember?
 Yes, but he wasn't the first
on everybody's list, only yours.
 Look, I know you're frustrated,
and we all want to find
 The person who sold out
our assets.
 Do we? I mean,
the berlin wall is down.
 The cold war is over.
 Does anyone really care about
assets we lost five years ago?
 I don't want to
wake up and find
 Another five years
have gone by
 And we are no closer
to finding the traitor.
 Look at him.
He's changed.
 He bought new clothes
in Italy.
 I think he looks nice.
 He seems so confident.
 Does that make him
a traitor?
 [ telephone ringing ]
 Hello?
 Hey.
I'm on my way home.
 Great.
What are we doing
for dinner?
 Uh...
 How about chinese?
 Sorry?
Chinese.
 You know, egg rolls,
lo mein, fortune cookies.
 Yeah.
Chinese sounds great.
 Bye.
Great.
 [ elevator bell dings ]
[ beeping ]
 Ah, louisa.
 I've been meaning
to catch up with you.
 Uh, rosario wanted to
invite you over for dinner
 To our new place.
 Oh, that would be great,
rick. Yeah.
 I know she'd --
she'd love to see you,
 And I can't wait
for you to meet my son, paul.
 He's just lovely.
Sweet.
 Since we moved back here
from rome, and, uh...
 So, what do you say?
Sunday?
 Um...
 Sure. Yeah.
 That's excellent.
 I'll, um --
I'll let her know.
 Okay, great.
 [ elevator bell dings ]
 Good night, sandy.
 Have a great weekend.
 [ clears throat ]
 [ telephone rings ]
 Hello?
 Hey.
I haven't left yet.
 Um...
Something came up.
 I'm sorry.
 Sure.
 We'll pick up
some stuff for you.
 I love you.
 Yeah,
I love you, too.
 [ sighs ]
 [ dial tone ]
 [ beeping, lock clicks ]
 Okay, rick.
 It's just you and me now.
 Let's see what you got.
 [ clock ticking ]
 [ sighs ]
 [ sighs ]
 [ beeping, lock clicks ]
 [ gasps ]
 [ breathing heavily ]
 [ dog barking ]
 [ sighs ]
 Could you take a look at this?
It's your log book.
 You know someone there?
 Everyone.
 So, solve gt weigh?
 Not yet.
 Does she suspect you?
 [ sighs ]
 [ sighs ]
 [ groans ]
 [ breathing heavily ]
 [ heart beating ]
 [ clock ticking ]
 [ moans ]
 How long
have you been there?
 I don't know. A while.
 Can't sleep.
 All you do
is worry about money.
 All you do
is spend it.
 In case you haven't noticed,
rosario, there is a recession --
 I know, rick.
I read the papers.
 Well, then you will also know
the cold war is over.
 There aren't that many secrets
left to sell.
 Besides...
 They're reshuffling
the department.
 I'm being moved
to counter-narcotics.
 But the good news is...
 The further away we get...
 The less likely
we get caught.
 Sometimes I wish
they would catch us.
 [ telephone rings ]
 Hello?
 Just tell me one thing.
 Okay, if I can.
 Tell me this is
over something really important.
 Not just, you know,
garden-variety important.
 Tell me this is
over something monumental.
 It's monumental.
 I'll see you
when you get back.
 See you when I get back.
 Louisa: The house
is fantastic, rosario.
 You picked a great place
to raise paul.
 Louisa, I can't begin
to tell you
 How good it is
to see you.
 I know.
It's been too long.
 So, you ready
for a drink?
 Chardonnay?
That's a good idea.
 Rosario?
I'll have the same.
 Thank you, honey.
Okay, two chardonnay.
 He's adorable.
Adorable.
 Who, rick?
Oh. Please.
 Brought some rome style
back home with you.
 Well, we were there
for three years, so...
 But actually,
I could use your help.
 So, we're changing
the drapes, okay?
 Ah.
And I was hoping you could
take a look at these
 And tell me
what you think.
 Wow.
They're all amazing.
 I like that one.
 The waterfall pleat --
my favorite.
 Of course, they're
the most expensive, so...
 Oh. Um...
 Well...
 Well,
I like this, too.
 No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no. No.
 To be honest,
rick was hoping
 You'd talk me
into something cheaper.
 But why would
two women get together
 And choose
the cheaper drapes?
 Well...
Really?
 Besides, it's not like we really
need to worry about cost.
 Everything's paid for.
 Everything?
Yeah.
 This house?
 Well, don't tell anyone,
but we paid cash.
 Cash?
 Yeah.
Really?
 Well, it's best.
No mortgage. It's done.
 So now I can spend it
on drapes.
 [ laughs ]
do you mind if I ask?
 What?
 How much?
Yeah.
 $540,000.
 What?
Shh. Shh.
 Okay. Right.
Here you are -- chardonnay.
 So, you made any decisions
about the drapes?
 What do you like?
Oh, yeah.
 The most expensive ones,
right?
 [ laughs ]
hmm?
 [ paul coos ]
of course not.
 [ laughs ]
 Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
 That's my friend from work.
That's my friend from work.
 You know...
 [ inhales deeply ]
 ...I used to think
it was cool...
 Not knowing
what you did all week.
 But now?
 I know.
You can't explain.
 As usual.
 How much longer
is this gonna go on?
 [ sighs ]
 Taking a shower.
I'll make you some breakfast.
 Sandy: Good morning.
 Hey.
 There's a new timeline up
in the back room.
 You worked all weekend,
didn't you?
 You never left the building.
Don't be ridiculous.
 Morning, ladies.
Morning.
 Sandy worked
all weekend.
 She didn't even
leave the building.
 I -- [ sighs ]
really?
 Morning, everyone.
 Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
 I'll make this real quick --
 There'll be a series
of routine security interviews
 Now, I want to stress that
these interviews are routine.
 We'll be running
separate polygraphs, as well.
 It's just to, uh...Get
some holes out of the system.
 So, uh, john,
you'll be interviewed.
 Uh, dave, roger, rick.
 I'll post the rest of the times
and names outside my door, okay?
 All right.
Let's go to work.
 Oh, rick, sorry.
You'll be first up.
 I need you to be polygraphed
at lunch today.
 Polygraph with lunch,
huh?
 I have a glass of wine
with that?
 Might help the results.
 Depends.
You got something to hide?
 Haven't we all?
Mm.
 Did you hear that?
 He was kidding.
 Hey.
Hey, sandy.
 How was your weekend?
 Okay.
 Do anything fun?
 Not really.
Just hang out.
 Went over to rick's.
 Yeah?
How was that?
 You know, it was nice
to see him and rosario again.
 Uh, catch up.
It's been a while.
 But?
 No "buts."
 We had a nice time.
 Something happened,
didn't it?
 Yes.
 I found a secret radio
transmitter in their basement.
 But I destroyed it,
so everything's fine now.
 People died, louisa,
and someone is --
 Rick's name was --
number one, yes. I get it.
 But that doesn't mean
that he's the mole.
 I honestly
do not understand
 Where your obsession
with him is coming from.
 You've become so single-minded,
it's like you're on a vendetta,
 Like you have something
personal against rick.
 This isn't personal,
louisa.
 He's the only one
that makes sense.
 There are other names
on the list.
 With everyone else,
it's technically possible.
 With rick,
it's an easy fit.
 No,
that is circumstantial.
 Why are you fighting
with me?
 Because
he's a fellow human being
 Who deserves to be treated
with dignity and respect.
 If we rush into this, we could
make a horrible mistake.
 If we did,
I couldn't live with myself.
 Raise your arms,
please.
 Okay,
you can sit down.
 [ laughing ]
 Hey. No tickling.
 Sorry, sir.
 Did you have
a good weekend?
 Yes, thanks.
What did you do?
 I went fishing.
 You take your
polygraph machine along?
 You know, hoping to catch
some honest fish, huh?
 [ chuckles ]
 Well,
I didn't catch a thing.
 I guess all fish
are kind of slippery, huh?
 He's smart.
That's how you beat it --
 Become friendly
with the examiner,
 Get him to like you.
 It's clever.
Or it's friendly.
 Okay.
We'll get started.
 Please state your name
for the record.
 Aldrich hazen ames.
 Have you ever been offered money
for classified information?
 Yes.
 Have you ever accepted money
for classified information.
 No.
 Have you ever spied
for a foreign government?
 No.
 Do you know anyone who has spied
for a foreign government?
 Are you including assets?
 Our assets.
Yes.
 Then yes.
 God, he's smooth.
 Maybe he's just
telling the truth.
 Well?
 He passed
with flying colors.
 You got on pretty well
with him in there.
 Sandy.
 What are you implying,
ma'am?
 You have to admit,
he got on your good side.
 The examiner's job
is to remain objective
 At all times.
 So there was nothing
out of the ordinary?
 Not unless you consider
 An unblemished graph
out of the ordinary.
 The machine doesn't lie.
 You mean his results
were too perfect?
 No, they're
exactly perfect --
 A decent range,
steady but not flat.
 They indicate a normal amount
of anxiety regarding the truth.
 Could
he be a sociopath?
 Sandy!
 Sociopaths
are utterly flat,
 Devoid of any
emotional response.
 So he's telling
the truth.
 Or he's the best liar
I've ever seen.
 Hey, jim.
Can we talk a sec?
 What can the fbi do
at this point?
 You mean aside from being
on this joint task force?
 Could you just
poke around?
 I'm sorry.
You mean with ames?
 Did I miss something?
He passed his polygraph.
 The examiner said
he could be lying.
 No. The examiner said
he passed his polygraph.
 You said
he could be lying.
 And, anyway, you can't get
a warrant with "could be."
 Well, could you
do something off the books?
 [ sighs ]
 Us simply having
this conversation
 Verges on breaking around
10 different federal laws,
 Not to mention a host
of fbi guidelines.
 I hardly know you, sandy,
but for your sake,
 And for the sake
of your career,
 I'm gonna pretend you never
asked me that question.
 Paul ames, huh?
 [ paul coos ]
[ babbles ]
 Rick?
 Uh-huh?
 I was wondering,
how will people know
 Or find out
what you've been doing?
 No one will ever
figure it out.
 But what if they did?
How would it happen?
 Loose lips, I suppose.
 Or if we spend too much
too obviously.
 Right.
 They've been trying to
figure out what happened
 Since 1985,
and they've gotten nowhere.
 They put two women on the job,
and they will never catch me.
 Never.
 It won't happen.
 I promise.
 At the end, after you've
asked them everything else,
 I'd like you
to ask them this.
 Just to throw a wrench
into the questions,
 See how they react.
 Okay.
Let's get started.
 How long
were you in moscow?
 Uh, two years.
 I was never in moscow.
 '81 through '89.
 I've been there a lot
but always on short trips.
 I was
never stationed there.
 Have you ever been
approached by the kgb?
 Five times.
 They attempted to recruit me
in '84 in argentina.
 At the soviet embassy in moscow,
I was approached by a diplomat
 Who asked me if I had
anything I needed
 To go back to the u.S.A.
In his diplomatic pouch.
 Oh, yes. Many times.
 Mitch: And did you report this
to your direct superior?
 Yes. Check my logs.
I always reported it.
 Yes. Although not until
two months had passed.
 My station chief was ill and I
wasn't reporting to anyone else.
 I believe I did.
In fact, I'm sure.
 But since it was
no actual offer,
 There was
little to report.
 Of course I did.
Every time.
 Finally, if you were
to sell information to the kgb,
 It'd be easy --
uh, all we'd have to do
 Is go to the gas station
near lubyanka.
 All the senior case officers
get their gas there.
 Just have to pass them
a note.
 I think I'd walk
right into their embassy --
 I mean,
right here in d.C.
 All you have to do is dine
at cafÃ© pushkin
 Every night for a week.
 All their agents
eat there.
 You'd be approached,
I'm sure.
 Finally,
one last question.
 If you were to
sell information to the kgb,
 How would you do it?
 Uh...
 Rick, how would you sell
intelligence to the kgb?
 I-I don't understand.
 What do you mean?
 Well, as a hypothetical,
 If you were to spy,
how would you do it?
 Oh, god. I mean,
that's just not, uh...
 I-I'd have to think
about that.
 That's just not something
I've ever r-really considered.
 No. Never.
 No, no.
 Did you guys
see what I saw?
 I mean, come on.
 Well, he certainly
looked guilty.
 Exactly.
That doesn't mean
that he is guilty.
 No, but it means we can take his
name up to the seventh floor.
 I told you. Everyone here
has to agree he's our guy.
 Okay. Fine. You all saw
what happened in there.
 What do you think?
 Who would put ames
at the top of their list now?
 He certainly did not like
that last question I threw in.
 I'm not saying
he's guilty,
 But he's gone
to the top of my list.
 Okay.
I'll just keep trying.
 Like a dog with a bone.
 I heard that.
 [ elevator bell dings ]
 Hey, sandy!
Sandy, wait up.
 [ beeping ]
 You ever hear
of project slammer?
 No.
 It's an fbi study
of a bunch of convicted spies.
 It looks for similarities,
tries to help profile them.
 And?
 If you want...
 I can send over ames' file
and see what the project --
 Yes!
 That would be great,
jim.
 Really great.
Thank you.
 Okay.
I'll take care of it.
 Butler: In an interview
early in his career,
 A cia psychologist
called ames sheepish,
 As though
he was hiding something.
 Now, lots of people
hide things,
 Plus people are often nervous
talking to psychologists.
 But in a return visit
later that year,
 The same psychologist noted
that ames had changed.
 He developed a "wall."
 He appeared better
able to hide his feelings.
 Is that a big deal?
 Taken on its own,
no, but taken
 In conjunction
with other variables,
 Are there other variables?
There are.
 Ames has a history
of bad performance reviews.
 That can precipitate bitterness
towards an employer,
 And that bitterness
can translate
 Into motivation
for espionage.
 And then
there's his finances.
 He's had collection agencies
after him in the past.
 He's got his wife's money now.
She has an inheritance.
 Reckless spending
in the past can be
 A potential indicator
of future espionage.
 You should double-check
his finances.
 Are you
absolutely positive
 That the money
comes from her family?
 Anything else?
 Yes. One last thing.
 His new persona --
 The playboy, calm,
affable, confident...
 You mentioned
that he wasn't nervous
 Correct.
Everyone is nervous
during a polygraph.
 Even innocent people?
 Especially
innocent people.
 Honestly, you ask me,
 Aldrich ames
fits the profile of a spy...
 To a "t."
 When you put it all together,
it means there is
 A very strong likelihood
that he's our guy.
 Not good enough.
Sorry.
 What about everyone else?
 I mean, jim, you were there.
You heard the profiler.
 The interview...
 Combined
with the profiler...
 Ames is on the top
of my list.
 Mitch?
 [ clears throat ]
 No. Not yet.
 Sorry, sandy.
 What about you?
 I -- I don't know.
 Not good enough.
Keep digging.
 We all have to keep digging...
On everyone.
 Hey.
 Can I talk to you
a second?
 Sure. Come on in.
 Shut the door.
 [ door closes ]
 I just...
 What is it?
 I don't want to
hurt anyone, sandy.
 Of course not.
 Neither do I.
I promise you.
 This might
not mean anything.
 We're talking
about his career, you know?
 A man's life.
 He has a family.
 Louisa...
 It's just
what you said in there
 About ames having
money problems.
 What about it?
 Rosario told me
a few years ago,
 Before she and rick
left for rome...
 That she wasn't rich
growing up in colombia.
 Her family
had no money.
 Nothing?
 His new house --
it's a very nice house.
 Rosario said they paid
over $500,000 for it.
 Okay. And?
 They paid in cash.
 Where are
his bank records?
 You've got them
in your hand.
 No, these are
his tax returns.
 Oh. Hang on.
 Here.
 Thanks.
 Thanks for staying late.
 The answer's in the money.
I know it.
 Wow.
 Lots of cash deposits here
back in '85.
 But all just under
10 grand each.
 Really?
 Is that legal?
 If they aren't
over 10 grand,
 The bank is not required
to report it to the irs.
 Hang on a second.
 On may 14th, he logged a meeting
with his kgb contact.
 'cause on may 15th,
he made a deposit for $9,500.
 On June 4th,
he logged another meeting.
 On June 5th,
he deposited $9,850.
 He meets a kgb officer
and the next day,
 Deposits money in the bank,
twice in a row?
 Awfully
big coincidence.
 Give me some more dates.
 July 8th.
 $9,999 deposit
on the 9th.
 August 27th.
 $9,100 deposit
on the 28th.
 October 15th.
 $9,200 deposit
on the 16th.
 Mitch, we got him.
 We got
the son of a bitch.
 We should get everybody in here.
Call them. Wake them up.
 No. We've waited
this long.
 I want to go through
everything.
 Make sure it's right.
 I want this airtight.
 Good lord.
You sure this is accurate?
 We can't be wrong
on this.
 We could get a forensic
accountant to look it over,
 But, yeah,
I'm pretty sure.
 "pretty"?
Positive.
 [ sighs ] well...
 A show of hands --
 Is aldrich ames at the top
of your list?
 What about you, art?
 Yeah.
 [ sighs ]
 Oh,
this is really great.
 Oh, jim,
can we get a warrant
 To, uh, tap his phone,
bug his house?
 No promises,
but it should be enough.
 All right.
 I'll take it upstairs.
 [ beeping, lock clicks ]
 I am so sorry, louisa.
 Oh.
 You're not the traitor.
 Rick is.
 Sandy. Hey.
 Hey, rick.
 I was just wondering how
the interviews are going.
 They're going well, rick --
really, really well.
 Oh, that's good.
That's great to hear.
 Well, you let me know if
there's anything else I can do
 'cause I'm --
I'm happy to help.
 I'll let you know.
I promise.
