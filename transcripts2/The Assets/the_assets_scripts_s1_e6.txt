 The Assets (2014–…): Season 1, Episode 6 - A Small Useless Truth - full transcript 
 Having put aside their differences, Sandy and Jeanne move full steam ahead with their mole hunt. The investigation experiences a serious setback, though, when Sandy learns that General ...

 Who may know the name of every
single one of these people.
 Previously on "the assets"...
 Top hat was trying to
reestablish contact.
 What if it's a trap
and they're just waiting
for proof of his treason?
 Sandy: The kgb know
we're looking for our breach,
 And they don't want us
to find it.
 I agree with that.
 So we're on the same side?
 My transfer finally
came through -- Italy.
 The seventh floor decided
to shut down the task force.
 What?!
Louisa:
But you can't.
 I'm not giving up, jeanne.
I won't -- not ever.
 Neither will I.
 [ mutters ]
 Alyosha: Papa.
 [ clicks heels ]
 [ bird squawks ]
 [ sighs ]
 Jeanne: Lunch?
I made us egg-salad sandwiches.
 Thank you.
 What is it?
 Does it ever bug you?
 Every minute of every day.
 He's out there.
 Could be a woman.
 Why? Why did they kill
our investigation?
 A mole in the s.E. Division
does not make the cia look good.
 And as long as
no more assets are dying,
 Why kick the hornet's nest?
 Politics.
 How can you be so calm?
 The serenity to accept
the things I cannot change.
 [ sighs ]
 That's where we differ.
I know.
 That's what makes us
a good team.
 [ chuckles ]
 [ knock on door ]
 Yeah?
 [ sighs ]
 Five years, rick.
 Five years?
 Since your last poly.
 Oh.
 Has it been?
 Yep. You're due.
 Mm-hmm.
 And my new assignment?
 Rome?
Mm-hmm.
 Well, that's not gonna happen
till they strap you in.
 Anyway, don't worry.
Standard procedure.
 Pass and you'll be at the
coliseum before you know it.
 Mm-hmm.
 [ camera shutters clicking ]
 [ knock on door ]
you wanted to see me?
 You're pacing
before I even opened my mouth.
 Not a good sign.
 It's an icon
of patron saint thomas more
 From my harvard days.
 Okay.
 Care to explain?
 More fell from royal favor
 Because he spoke up
for what he believed.
 They found him guilty
of high treason.
 He was beheaded.
 "indignatio principis
mors est."
 "the anger of the sovereign
means death."
 Where are you going
with this, art?
 Because it reminds me
things are not in vain,
 And I share it now...
 To remind you.
 What's not in vain?
 The asset losses.
 There's been another.
 [ breathes deeply ]
 Gt-top hat --
 Dmitri polyakov --
has been compromised.
 [ inhales deeply ]
 The magnitude
of this loss is...
 I wanted you to hear it
from me first.
 You're sure?
 Yes.
 [ rachmaninov's "all-night
vigil, op. 37" plays ]
 [ music stops ]
 Waiter:
Good evening, sir.
 Uh, martini, vodka --
straight up.
 [ russian accent ]
it was colder 15 minutes ago.
 Well, nice to see you,
too, ames.
 What is that -- sarcasm?
 Am I missing something
 Or are we supposed to be
bosom buddies now?
 They're polygraphing me --
 Tomorrow.
 So?
 You've done it before.
 Yes,
I've done it before.
 But things are --
well, they're different now.
 When I did
my last polygraph,
 I was a hardworking
cia case officer,
 And now I'm --
now I don't know --
 Waiter:
Here you are, sir.
 I-I don't know...
 What I am now.
 That polygraph needle's
gonna be moving up and down
 Like a seesaw.
 They're gonna nail me
to the wall.
 And rosario.
 [ speaks indistinctly ]
 I honestly...Do not know
what I'm gonna do.
 What you are going to do
is pass the test.
 And I'm going to
tell you how.
 Sandy: This is what I want.
I quit.
 You're not serious.
 I've thought it through.
 For how long?
 Long enough.
 It's done.
Well, it's not done
till I say it's done.
 Is this about top hat --
polyakov?
 Yes.
 And other things.
 The fact that
there is probably a traitor
 Working in this building,
 And no one will take
the time or effort
 To go after that person.
 That's a fair criticism.
 Large bureaucracies
rarely function perfectly.
 But you're a soldier,
sandy,
 Fighting the cold war,
protecting the nation.
 And even soldiers
get tired of battle.
 I'm worn out.
 And heartbroken.
 And heartbroken.
 [ sighs ]
 I, uh,
respect your decision.
 The loss will be enormous
for myself
 And, uh...
For the agency.
 Hey.
 If I was to reopen
the 1985 investigation
 Into the asset losses...
 Would you stay for that?
 We have tapes
of his interrogation
 From a new in-place source
at lubyanka.
 I could make them available
to you.
 Cherkashin:
Remember, ames.
 [ exhales shakily ]
 You...Are...A liar.
 But the polygraph
does not detect lies.
 It detects breathing, heartbeat,
blood pressure, and sweat.
 The test is a wolf
in sheep's clothing --
 Physiological test designed
to detect the psychological.
 It's nonsense.
 If you control your body,
you control the test.
 Develop a rapport
with the polygrapher.
 Try and find commonality.
 Be cooperative.
 And just like in every good joke
there's a sliver of truth,
 Every good lie
has one, too.
 Give them a truth.
 Give them
a small, useless truth,
 Hidden within
the greater lie.
 A small, useless truth...
 Mr. Ames?
Yes?
 I'm ready
to polygraph you.
 This way, please.
 Thank you.
 [ footsteps approaching ]
 [ breathes deeply ]
 [ clock ticking ]
 [ speaking russian ]
 "bring in the prisoner."
 Volkov:
Secure the prisoner's shackles.
 [ shackles click ]
 Interrogator
volkov gennady,
 General of the first chief
directorate,
 With prisoner
polyakov dmitri?
 The tape recorder
does not pick up gestures.
 Polyakov dmitri fedorovich.
 Polyakov dmitri fedorovich.
 You are charged
with espionage --
 In particular,
 The clandestine intelligence
gathering and delivery
 Of secret and confidential
information
 In regard to the political
and military dealings
 Of the u.S.S.R.
To our primary enemy,
 The central intelligence agency
of the United States of america.
 Do you understand
these charges?
 My family...
 ...They are innocent
in all these matters.
 I ask that you spare them
any further pain.
 That is not an answer.
 Until you promise no harm
will befall my family...
 ...I have no answer.
 I am not here
to make promises to you.
 This is not a negotiation.
 Do you understand the charges?
Yes or no?
 We had a jumper
just this morning.
 Fourth of the year.
 Unfortunate for us,
but this place...
 It breaks
the strongest of men.
 Whether they jump...
 Or they are pushed...
 ...Eventually,
they all fall.
 You will fall.
 [ footsteps departing ]
 [ door slams ]
 You been doing this a while?
Yep.
 I've been with the agency
since...
 1962. I'm aware.
 Right. Records.
 What doesn't the agency
keep track of?
 I bet they know
what I ate for breakfast.
 I can assure you
that they don't.
 But if I were
to venture a guess,
 I'd say
you didn't eat a thing.
 Most people
are too nervous.
 Hm.
 Bagel and coffee.
 Oh, well,
why don't we begin?
 [ door opens, closes ]
 I sympathize with you.
 I do.
 You have never been on that side
of the table before.
 Neither have I.
 [ chair squeaks ]
 You were highly decorated.
 They do not give these medals
without good reason.
 My service
was to the motherland.
 Yes.
 Impeccable.
 Training at frunze.
 Me too.
 Artillery officer
in the war.
 Me too.
 And then the move
to military intelligence.
 We probably crossed paths
numerous times.
 After the war...
 After what was suffered...
 After what we saw...
 I...
 Wanted to be
part of change.
 Yes.
 [ chuckles ]
 Comrade.
 So did I.
 This will measure
your cardiovascular activity,
 Respiratory,
and electrodermal.
 You a maroon?
 Hmm?
 Your class ring --
 University of chicago,
right?
 [ chuckles ]
 ♪ beneath the hope-filled
western skies ♪
 ♪ 'tis our dear alma mater
 [ chuckles ]
 Well, how 'bout that?
 Fellow alum in my room.
 That's right.
[ chuckles ]
 The old maroon and white.
 Yeah.
 They were good days.
 Other than the fact
that I spent too much
time in the library.
 I practically lived
at the theater.
 They could have
charged me rent.
 I played cassius
in "julius caesar,"
 And then I just, uh...
 I caught the bug.
 Mm.
 Thought maybe
I'd be an actor.
 Guess I'm a ways off
 From what I planned
on doing with my life.
 I'd say
you did all right.
 When'd you turn
the tassel?
 I didn't. Finished up
at george washington.
 Oh.
 Okay, please sit
perfectly still
 And continue to look
straight ahead for the
duration of the test.
 Is your name
aldrich ames?
 Volkov: Being so similar,
you and I,
 I can't help but ask --
 How did we come to be
on opposite sides of the table?
 We both love this country,
its people.
 Where did it go wrong?
 [ chuckles lightly ]
 This is good,
comrade volkov.
 Relate with the intent
of engaging in a dialogue.
 "I simply
want to understand.
 I help you.
You help me."
 Step 3
in the reid method --
 Breaking a prisoner.
 You do it well.
 You've learned
from the americans.
 But perhaps what you should
really be asking yourself is,
 "how do I interrogate
someone
 Who knows
every card in my hand?"
 [ chuckles ]
 It makes me sick...
 To think what someone of my rank
could have handed over.
 [ chuckles ]
 You had access
to military plans,
 Strategic information,
 Confidential material
 From the ministry
of foreign affairs.
 [ scoffs ]
 You are a disgrace.
 You were a general
of the soviet union!
 A title
that commands honor...
 Respect, trust!
 If you cannot trust
a general of the soviet union,
 Who can you trust?
 Indeed.
 It's a good question --
 The best you have asked
so far.
 [ spits ]
 Would you ever consider
spying for a foreign-
intelligence service?
 [ breathing shallowly ]
 No.
 Have you ever been offered
money or gifts
 By a foreign-intelligence
service
 In exchange
for classified information?
 No.
 Have you ever
been pitched
 To work for
a foreign-intelligence service?
 No.
 Have you disclosed
any unauthorized
classified information
 To a foreign-intelligence
service?
 No.
 Volkov: What did you give
the americans?
 [ gasping, panting ]
 [ gurgling ]
 [ water sloshing]
 [ panting ]
 What did you give
the americans?!
 [ whimpers ]
I want you to promise --
 No promises.
 Again.
 But he will --
again!
 [ inhales deeply ]
 [ water sloshes]
 [ thudding ]
 [ gurgling ]
 [ gasping ]
 My family --
 Enough.
 [ whimpers ]
 [ coughing ]
 Your family
will be spared.
 [ kicks ]
 Now talk.
 [ chair squeaks]
 [ panting ]
 I...
 I began my relationship
with the americans in 1961.
 I...Identified
g.R.U. And kgb officials.
 While in burma...
 I provided the cia
intelligence
 Of our military assistance
to the north vietnamese...
 ...As well as...
Handling and design manuals
 For long-range communication
devices, rollover cameras,
 Miniature recorders...
 ...Nuclear strategy...
 ...The g.R.U. Bible,
party publications,
 Information on
our chemical-warfare program,
 And foreign-policy plans
and objectives
 For every major country.
 [ chair squeaks ]
 You gave up...
 ...Everything.
 You asked.
 I told you.
 You hate
your own country.
 No.
 I hate the people
running my country.
 They are criminals
in uniform.
 The communist party
protects the people.
 And destroys them
at the same time.
 Have you had
any unauthorized contact
 With foreign-intelligence
services while in the u.S.?
 A small, useless truth.
 Excuse me?
 Only soviet diplomats.
 But that's authorized.
 Mr. Ames,
"yes" or "no," please.
 I'm sorry.
 No.
 According to records,
you've had reported contact
 With soviet attaché
viktor cherkashin.
 Is this true?
 Yes.
 You met him
on more than one occasion?
 Yes.
 At any point, did mr. Cherkashin
attempt to get you
 To spy for the soviets?
 No.
 Polyakov: The russian people
make sacrifice again and again.
 And for what?
 More corruption?
More pain?
 You just want
to line your pockets --
 Load up
with american wealth.
 I took no money.
 It was never for me.
 It was for the future
of russia.
 A convenient
rationalization.
 You...And the party --
 You are killing
everything.
 Your treachery
had a cost.
 Lives will be lost
because of it.
 You prolonged the war
against the imperialists.
 There is no war
against imperialism.
 There are only old men
holding on to power.
 You think...
I am an anomaly...
 But I am one of many.
 A revolution is coming --
 In thought, in action --
 And [laughs] there is nothing
you can do to stop it.
 The party
will be overthrown.
 Your generation
must make a stand.
 [ panting ] you must --
you must speak out.
 Take action!
 Do not address him.
 You must speak out
against injustice.
 Ungh!
 Speak again.
 See what happens.
 [ panting ]
 For the future of russia!
 Wait outside.
 [ footsteps departing ]
 [ door closes ]
 [ ring clatters ]
 [ footsteps approaching ]
 [ thud ]
 [ fists thudding]
 [ thudding continues ]
 [ volkov grunting ]
 It seems
you had some trouble
 With the foreign-intelligence
portion of the test --
 Specifically with contacts
and being pitched.
 Oh.
 Well, I-I suppose
that's because, uh...
 Well, we know the soviets are
out there, you know? Somewhere.
 And we're worried
about that.
 And we should be.
 And I probably reacted strangely
to questions about contacts
 Only because, as I said,
 I've met with soviet diplomats
in the past,
 But, uh...
I always report my contact.
 Hmm.
 Can you explain
your reaction
 To the questions
about being pitched?
 No.
 Maybe that's because of my job
in counterintelligence.
 I mean, I've pitched
to potential assets,
 But I've never been
pitched to.
 I...I think I've got those
a little mixed up...
 You know, emotionally?
 Also, you know,
I'm headed to rome soon,
 I'm nervous about
being recruited by the kgb.
 Not that I ever would go over
to the other side, but...
 Well...
 You -- you, uh...
You fantasize...
 So you can get into the mind
of the enemy, you know?
 The nature of the job --
 Put yourself in their shoes,
right?
 I think about how
they would get me to be a spy.
 You know what I mean?
 [ door opens ]
 Walt: Mr. Ames?
 Mr. Ames.
 Yes?
 You passed.
 I'll have your paperwork
sent upstairs.
 Great.
 Great.
 That's great.
 Enjoy Italy.
 [ chuckles ]
 Ciao.
 [ car door slams ]
 [ panting ]
 [ sobbing ]
 Oh, god.
 Oh, god.
 Ohh.
 Ohh.
 [ laughing ]
 Sign it.
 Put your name to the declaration
that you are a traitor.
 A coward --
in life and in death.
 Sign the confession,
 Or I'll jam the pen through
your hand and do it for you.
 I regret nothing.
 And given the chance,
I would do it again.
 Really? Even if every time,
the outcome was the same?
 I knew full well
death was a possibility.
 For you?
 Or for your son?
 I did not want
to have to tell you this.
 Apparently,
the shame was too much...
 ...To be the son
of a traitor...
 To bear the burden
of your name.
 My...
 Alyosha?
 We received word,
uh, several hours ago
 That he took his own life
shortly after your arrest.
 He shot himself.
 Apparently,
some people did believe
 That you were
a traitor...
[ gasps ]
 And acted accordingly.
 [ breathing shakily ]
 [ headphones clatter ]
 [ weakly ]
you are bluffing.
 Alyosha would never
do anything so selfish.
 You are pathetic.
 I suppose
you'll never know.
 Every ounce of you...
Is pure cruelty.
 [ chair squeaks ]
 And every ounce of you
is betrayal.
 I was born russian.
I have lived russian.
 And I will die russian.
 Yes.
 That, you certainly will.
 [ door opens ]
 [ door closes ]
 [ tape flapping ]
 [ click ]
 [ flapping slows, stops ]
 Quit. Stay.
 Either way,
I'll support you.
 But whatever
you decide...
 Don't leave the job
half done.
 No lingering regrets.
 Do the thing right.
 [ birds chirping ]
 Alla prossima volta.
 [ breathing shakily ]
 [ gun cocks ]
 [ knock on door ]
 I take it back.
 Consider my resignation
withdrawn.
 I'm in
for the 1985 solve.
 I know they're still here,
and I'm gonna get the bastard.
 What are you doing in my office?
Get back to work.
 Good to have you back.
 Good to be back.
