 Most of them didn't get far, before they'd found out... The dream had a big sign on it that said... "Reserved." Some of em got out, went back home... They didn't know it. But they were the lucky ones... Molly Jackson wasn't so lucky... She had ended up, face down in the L.A. river. Nobody cared except a pal'o mine named Jed Mason who ran the bus terminal diner. He had given Molly a job when she hit town ...And he wanted to know why she died... That was easy... Because she was pretty and alone... And young enough to believe what anyone told her, even here in Hollywood. But Jed had asked me to dig out her killer.

 I felt bad about it, but I didn't have a thing to tell em. Intercom: Bus now boarding for points North, including... Bakersfield, Fresno, Oakland, San Francisco You shouldn't smoke... It don't look nice on a young gal. *Hmph* At the club everybody smokes. I should know, I'm the cigarette girl. You came all the way from Mississippi to sell matches? That's just for now... This guy that I work for, Mr. Waltz. Trimmer Waltz? You work at Juggernaut Club? You know it? I knew somebody who worked there... They ever mention Molly Jackson? *She Shrugs* No. Of course not... *Strikes Match* Thanks. *Dishes Clatter* Any news Mr. Marlowe? Aghhh! I'm wasting your money Jed! This here's a friend of mine. Mr. Marlowe. Hi there. Hi, Token, Token Ware. Token works at the Juggernaut Club. Trimmer's girls are gettin' younger everyday! Mr. Waltz has been very kind to me... And he knows a lot of people... Important people in the movies... He thinks I've got something... The right kind of face. Trimmer Waltz is gonna make you a star? Of course not... But he can take me around. Introduce me to people... Directors... You just gotta be at the right place, at the right time. That's all. And Trimmer gets nothin' outta this? Not what you're thinking of... No. Anyway, I gotta go. Save your breath Mr. Marlowe... They never listen, take it from me. She's too young for Noon Street. They grow-up quick! Or not at all... Intercom: Bus now boarding for San Diego and all points South. *Dish Clangs* Intercom: Loading on... The night she was killed. Molly Jackson went to Michael Blair's place. -The Director. -Hey, that's somethin' ! Couple a hundred other people were there too... It was a big Hollywood party... Molly showed up with a bunch of girls. Entertainment. >:( Party girls the butler said... And that was back when his memory was still workin'... Nobody saw her leave... Nobody saw anything... I can stay on it but-- *Deep Sigh* Even if you got the guy that cut Molly, I don't know... It wouldn't change nothin' ! There's 100 more Mollys, waitin' in line to end up like she did. Softly: Yeah. Ugh, oh no. It's on the house. *Sighs* I didn't wanna walk away from this case... Jed had helped out a lot of kids who were sad, or scared or... Just plain hungry... I wanted to let em know it wasn't all wasted... Now here was another girl with the Juggernaut blues... Maybe she could lead me closer to Molly Jackson's killer... Anyway... Somebody had to tell her that hanging around Noon Street... Could be bad for her health... *Glass Breaks* *Whooping/Laughter* Look Mr. please, I ain't got no money! It's me, Marlowe. *Chuckle* We just met! You lookin' for a cab? Yeah. They don't cruse Noon Street. C'mon. No! I mean some friends-- Some friends are gonna meet me here. It's a tough neighbourhood kid. Look Mister. Just leave me alone! *Scoff* Guess I'm gettin' jumpy... Your pals? They dropped somethin'. -Are you a cop? -What is it dope? I don't know he-he just told me to pick it up! Your boss, Trimmer Waltz?! You're not a cop are you? Let's go take a look! *Siren Turns On* Drop it! Freeze! Police... I'm Angus, Det. Lt. and you're under arrest Extortion and threats... Cuff em! Listen to me Angus. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. You can explain everything... And I'm making a big mistake. Private Eye, huh? Not enough dough for you these days? Too many smart cops around! Oh, you're a funny guy Marlowe... Save some jokes for Rupert Eaton, he could use a laugh. The guy who did "The Black Pirate" ? "Avenger of the high seas" ? The man who's face you threatened to burn off! *Wind Whistle* Ya got that Eaton? 2 Grand in small bills, or it's sulfuric acid in your kisser... Goodbye pretty face. Goodbye silver screen. No, I'm sure that's not the voice. On the telephone it's not always clear. Ah yes, but as an actor... I'm very sensitive to the nuances of intonation, inflection and... Ah! I think you know Miss Dean. My press agent... And uh, companion of the heart. *Smooch* This is the extortionist? We caught em on the street, with the dough in his fist. This is not the man. I took one of those vile calls... Let me hear him say something. *Chains Jingle* Goodbye pretty face. Goodbye silver screen. Goodbye underage girls, and out of court pay-offs... To angry parents. *Scoffs* It's a pity so many people believe the trash... They print in "Screen Secrets." As much as I hate to say it... This is not the man. Don't put it Marlowe. We'da nabbed the guy if you hadn't scared him off. Yeah, I guess I did screw it up didn't I? I mean what's the lady gonna tell the news boys now? They are on their way aren't they? What the hell are you suggesting?! Sulfuric acid threats... Movie stars, gallant stand! Makes for dandy publicity! Really, I think we've heard enough. At a guess... The gross from your last 2 movie's wouldn't give me cab fare. *Bad Hook!* *Ah!* Calm down Eaton! In real life... You could break your hand, hittin' a guy that way. You are a very objectionable man, Mr. Marlowe! *Sharp Breath* Nevertheless I must apologise, for hitting you when you could not defend yourself. *Scoff* Get em outta here! -If the guy calls again-- -We'll let you know at once. Yeah... Do that. A detective! He just happened to be there... *BOOZE* A coincidence. Well he knew all about your little ways, didn't he? As you said Irma... Anyone can read the "scandal rags." *Liquor Sloshing* You got a break, Marlowe. Quite a break. *Scoff* They were both so sure, I wasn't the guy on the phone. -So? -So... Who's to say the guy on the phone, is the guy who makes the pick-up? Sure... It could'a been a put-up job... Happens all the time. I just take the calls Marlowe. Go where they send me. Yeah! :) Doesn't leave a lotta' time for real crime though. Like the killing of Molly Jackson, say. Molly Jackson? Hooker, right? Yeah... Just a hooker... And the wrong colour for you guys to worry about. This is where you get out Seamus. Don't I get an apology? Sure. And the keys to the city... Buzz off Marlowe! I got enough trouble in Hollywood. *Upbeat Jazz* *Applause, Whistling, Laughter* -Thanks for the use of your room kid. -Oh anytime... So how you feelin' now? Oh! These headaches are gonna be the death of me... How's the crowd? Same as always. All hands... Sure hope I won't be doin' this much longer One more week and I'm outta here! Gonna get on a bus to Tallahassee and marry me... The first farm boy that I see! *Laugh Together* I can just see you now! Milkin' the cow! And I thought I was gonna dance my way to stardom on... These legs! *Giggles* Looks like this guy's got a shine for me... *Lip Smack* Not bad honey! He looks almost human! What're you doing here? Have a seat kid. -I can't! -Sit down Token, you owe me that much. You want somethin'? I ain't allowed. Nothing for the lady. *Boisterous Laughter* This is a real classy joint... You sure landed on your feet. Cops let you go, huh? Uh-huh... They didn't like it much. I guess I oughta' thank you... Ya got me out of a real tough spot. Who got you into it? Please Mr. Marlowe you ca-- Trimmer Waltz, right? "He's gonna help you out, introduce you around." I can't tell you nothin'! So you do him a little favour every now and then. Isn't that the way it goes? Look! I didn't ask you to help me. Now just leave me alone! Evening Marlowe. Summoned? Or are you trying to sniff-out some crime? If I was Trimmer, I wouldn't have to look very far... What're you cuttin' this with, gasoline? I didn't want to sit with him Mr. Waltz! He's the guy from Noon Street. It's okay sweetheart... You go on back to work now... I don't pay you to sit on your fanny, talkin' to good-lookin' guys. Laughter in distance: *Ba-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha!* Somethin' wrong? Everything. Well I got some real sour mash back in my office... Private stock... How bout it? Sure... I could use somethin' to sit on that one, I'm holdin' down! *Smooth Trumpet* That little lady you were talkin' to. Token Ware. Yeah! That's the name... Gonna break your heart! -*Laughing* -I like her. *Breath* That's tough... Cause I want you to leave her alone... Forget about her. She's not for you. Who's she for? No, you're not hearing me Marlowe... You're not hearing me at all... People come here for fun. And that's what we supply: Fun. You want a drink? *Heh* I'll give ya a drink... You want a girl, I'll give ya a girl... On the house! What the hell? But what I don't want Marlowe... Is you messing around in my business. Are you hearing me now? You saving her for Rupert Eaton? *Laughs* Oh, that's a lot a noise! Ahhh! Just hot air! It is hot in here... Mind if I open a window? *Hide and Seek* *Hammer Cocks* Don't twitch an eyelash! Give him the heater. *Evil Laugh* That's a boy. *Maniacal Cackling* You fall for an old gag like that. You're not so smart Marlowe. C'mon brother let's go-let's go. When dey is tough, I love to squeeze em! Alright, alright that's enough Rufus. That's enough! Yes, I loves to squeeze emmm Get em outta here! *Groans* *Coughing* Mr. Marlowe?! What happened? You did Token... You happened. Token lived in a 3rd story walk-up... Where the hot and cold taps, both ran cold... But it was clean... And up till now, she had been paying her own rent. Is that better? Groaning: Yeah... I don't suppose you got any whisky around here? Yeah... I keep it for colds. Nice place ya got here. It ain't much but it's just-- Yeah I know, It's... Just for now. Thanks sweetheart! You don't like it? *Eh* I like it... Fine... It's fine. *Clears Throat* I guess the cops were a real surprise! *Scoff* Look... I don't wanna talk about that... How many times am I gonna have to tell you that I-- Ok, ok. I'll talk... You listen... *Sniff* There's this movie star see? Only things are not going so good anymore.. In fact, people are runnin' not walkin' out of his movies like... *Nose Signal* So..... He cooks up this scam... calls up the cops and he says: "There are these bad guys... Gonna ruin my face... Unless I pay em 2 grand." What do the cops say? You're the know it all. You tell me. Cops say: "Go ahead and deliver the green stuff... Only we'll be there and grab the bad guys." There's only one problem Token... There are no bad guys to grab. What does he do? How should I know? He calls up his old pal, Trimmer Waltz. No! *Sigh* Trimmer says: "No problem!" "I got this kid. She'll do it, she won't talk." *Tsk* You're crazy! "And even if she does. Who's gonna believe her?" Just a kid, a long way from home... -No friends... -I got friends! Rose is my friend! Trimmer Waltz, set you up Token! The charges would'a been dropped... But the cops would'a had you pegged as a low life... And you'd be in just that much deeper to him! *Whiny Laugh* That just doesn't make any sense! I mean Mr. Waltz has already introduced me to some real important people. *Sigh* Now tell me about it. *Tsk* Well... See there are these movie stars. Who have trouble meeting people cause they're... Well they're too famous! They can't meet people, just like other people, meet people?! Lemme guess... You've been talking to someone who... Arranges meetings? Yeah! It's a sort of service. You could call it that. It's not like that ! It's just... It's just company! But you get to be in the right places... And that's what counts. These "lonely" movie stars that you'd meet ...Trimmer ever mention any names? Like ummm... Rupert Eaton, for instance? I could get to meet Rupert Eaton? Oh! I'd die! *Sighs* *Scoff* *Easy Listening On Radio* *Applause On Radio* *Refrigerator Slam* *Spins Rotary* *Back When There Were Only 5 Digits* *Phew* *Line Ringing* Yeah, it's Marlowe. -Voice on line: Philip! -*Clears Throat* I need the dope on uhm... An actor name of Rupert Eaton. Voice: What sort of dope are we discussing here? The usual. Trouble, enemies. Voice: Philip, nothing has ever come my way that would be substantial. How bout the stuff they print in the funny papers? Voice: Nothing there either I'm afraid... Voice: Only rumors of course. Uh-huh... But uh, up to now he's been able to buy his way out, huh? Voice: I suppose you could say that. Okay, uh, now his... Press agent, Irma somethin'. -Voice: ...Name is Irma Dean... -Irma Dean, right. I need a list of all the rest of her clients. Voice: ... is represented... is recognisable... Voice: Most notably... Michael Blair... OK, you let me know if you hear anything else. Voice: I'll be sure to. I gotta run, thanks Arbogast. Arbogast: No problem! *Bulb Flash* Right profile darling *Flash!* That's right... Now the famous smile! *Goof-Ball* *Dishes Clatter* So he never thought of just paying up? I mean, acid in the face? I confess it crossed my mind, but Rupert wouldn't hear of it. I could not bring myself to give in... To thugs and hoodlums... There is a uhm... A social duty. *Cheese Face* *Scoff* To the young people of this country ...Rupert Eaton represents an ideal of courage... Daring and high principles... He feels a deep responsibility to live up to this image in his... Private life too. Didn't the cops pick-up some guy? Oh! Yes... A witness that's all. Nobody. Have there been anymore threats? Oh no. Rupert's gallant stand. Seems to have scared off these crooks... This brings me back to "Shootout at El Paso" ... It will be released nationwide next week... Rupert plays a sheriff. Is that directed by Michael Blair? That's right... There are very few directors that Rupert trusts. I guess you see a lot of Blair? Y-Yes indeed! I don't quite see the point. I'm talkin' about a party at Blair's place. 20th of last month... Did you go to that one Mr. Eaton? That's possible I-I... Can't remember! *Fake Smile* Well to get back to-- There was a young girl there... Molly Jackson... She never made it home. *Murmuring* Mr. Eaton was on location all last month. Yes! That's right! Well gentlemen, I'm sure you can appreciate Rupert's been under a terrible strain. -"Shootout at El Paso." P-A-S-O. -Thank you very much. Good day everyone. Molly Jackson, I remember something about that. You're one'a the few sister. He's a reporter? I thought that-- It's fine Rupert. *Strike a Pose!* Irma, dear heart, wait! Later Rupert I have to make a call. Reporter: Thank you so much Mr. Eaton. -My pleasure. -OK Sure. -See ya! -It's in the car. -Nice interview. -Alright. *Indistinguishable Reporter Chatter* -That's fine with me! Uh-huh? Voice: Marlowe could be big trouble! -Voice: Fix it Trimmer! -What?! *Slam!* *Sigh* We gotta do somethin' about this Marlowe... He's pokin' his nose in, gettin' too close! Kid must'a shot her mouth off... We'd better get her outta' the way first. *Evil Chuckle* *Lock Rattles* *Child Cries in Distance* *Sigh* *Window Falls Open* *Window Shuts* *Sounds Like a Chain lock* *Thematic Sound Effect* *Stalker Exhale* Easy, honey-baby! Easy now... *Rufus Groans* I thought I told you never to come here! I had to see ya. You know Trimmer, sometimes I just think your not cut out for the big-time! Don't you think that! Cause I got this girl under control. And I can waste no time doin' it. What about... Marlowe?! *Telephone Rings* Eaton residence. Voice: Let me talk to Trimmer. It's for you. Yeah, what? Voice: ...Taken care of. Man: $5! OK maybe, $3... - 3-3's it, 3's my deal... Yeah. - $3? OK that's cool, let's go. *Knocking at Door* Token? *5 Firm Knocks* Token... Discard this one... And on Lou's usual, pick it up. What are you doing today O'Mally? This is not how to key a game. -Oh don't tell me you don't... -Hi guys welcome to... Damn, damn... *Gasp!* What did I tell youuuu?! You asked me-- You told me to get rid of her so I-- No idiot!!! All I said was to get the girl outta the way! Yeah but then I thought Mr. Wal-- Don't think damnit! You're no good at it. If you had a half a brain, you would realise that a... Dame is no good to me dead! But she ain't dead Mr. Waltz-- No, no! She is out there peddling smokes! Rose Delaney is dead! Well it was dark. With your paw marks, all over her! This is a mess. A mess! Softly: A mess. Well Mr. Waltz you know... Rose Delaney was gonna blow town anyway... So you don't lose a nickle there... I can take the kid over tonight. And what about Marlowe? Huh?! Where is Marlowe?! You have to get outta here! -Token. -No! I mean it! I can't talk to you... -Mr. Waltz just-- -You have-- He was real mad... He said you were causing a whole lotta' trouble... And it was my fault! -He said that-- -You have to leave here, right now! No! You're ruining everything! Now just take a hike! Listen to me... We have to talk! Okay... I'll meet you someplace... I just have to wait for Rose to come and spell me. Rose isn't coming Token. Please Mr. Marlowe... You have to go! I'll meet you out back soon. Rose is dead. She just had a headache... She went to my place to lay down... She just gets these really terrible headaches. She's dead Token. Mr. Marlowe... Rose is gonna walk through that door... Any second now. Softly: No! Don't touch me! Don't you touch me! -Hey. -Come on, let's go! -Let's go honey! -No, stop! -Token! -Come on now. -Token!! -We gonna take good care of you. -Please, Mr. Marlowe! It's alright boys! It's OK, just another drunk, that's all. I gotta look after my girls! Keep practicing! One, Two... *Hammer Cocks* Hold it! Now there's no need for all this noise. Sit down, Marlowe... Let's talk. Token is being well looked after! She's safe! *Scoff* Safe as Rose Delaney? Yeah, well... I'm sorry about dat... It was a real shame. It's not the way I wanted it worked out. Come on, Trimmer! Look it, Marlowe! We're talkin' now. We're not dancing around! You got in the way of somethin'. Nothin' much. Just a favour I was doin' for a pal o' mine Rupert Eaton? Yeah... You come in here and you... Start askin' questions and pushing people around... And bothering my girls! So I told Ruf to take her to one'a my other joints... And tell Marlowe to lay off! Scare ya a little, that's all. The rest of it was his idea... Believe me, I got plenty mad! Where has he taken her, Trimmer? What is so important to you, about this one little hooker? *Made You Look!* She is no hooker! You were savin' her, for the movie crowd! You tell me that address... -Or that was your last breath! -Alright... But... You don't blow me away, cause then ya won't find her ya know? You know what happens to rats in this district. Yeah! They run nightclubs! The address, c'mon. Hey! C'mon! Hey you want her that bad, she's yours! Oh that's it! It's 94 Pine Crest... You gotta ask for Reno! What? What more do you want?! Tell?!! *Sighs* "Royal jelly"... That's appropriate... Do you know how much this stuff costs? To the cent. Well... It's not doing a thing for me! Darling... You look marvelous. Oh, I don't know... I still think Guns at El Paso-- "Shootout" my sweet. You really must try to remember. I still think it was a mistake... I'm just not the gunfighter type! Darling. You, were brilliant... As always. *Chuckles* Mmmm... -I can play against type, can't I? -Mmm-hmm! Irma? Mmm-hmm? -If... Guns... -"Shootout." If it's another flop... I'm finished. You're not gonna fall apart on me, are you? Oh, darling... The studio thinks that this publicity alone ...Makes "Shootout" a smash! *Tsk* Oh, I don't know. Irma knows what Rupert needs... Hmm? Rupert needs a new friend... *Chuckle* A new little friend, hmm? *Smooch* Now you be a good boy... And I'll fix it... Just like always. Some people call them "Joy Palaces." Whoever they were, they hadn't done much talking... To the ladies who peddled the joy. Hi there... I don't believe we've had the pleasure. You Reno? No I ain't. What can I do for you? Take me to Reno. If it's an introduction to a young lady, I can take care of that. Trimmer Waltz sent me... Now snap it up! Heyyy, I bet I can ease your pain babe. Character here says: Trimmer sent him. Mmm, just tell me what you like. Another time angel. -Oh! Let me guess-- -Hey!! Beat it. I'm Reno. What's the scenario? Trimmer sent me over to pick-up that uhh... New kid. You know what I mean? New kid?! *Chuckles* We ain't got no "new kid" exactly. But I'm uh, sure we can, fix ya up. Cut the crap Reno. Her name is Token Ware.. And Ruf just brought her over here. Oh that girl. Yeah! That girl, where is she?! Here, but see uh... The thing is Mr. Waltz... He said that, he had special plans for that girl. Nobody was to go near her, understand? Said he was uh, "saving her." That's right. For me. Oh yeah? Well I'll tell you what... Why don't I give Mr. Waltz a call? Sorta, check it out. Make me feel much better! Come on! Where?! Please stop it! Stop! Relax, don't struggle so much now, you're making it hard. Move! What man? Doh-- Man: He's got a gun! Lose it! Let her go! LOSE... IT. Trimmer's not gonna be too happy, if you damage his goods Ruf. Sure, I'll let er go... Cause it's you I want snooper! First you, then the little girl... Little sassy girl... But I'm doin' the choosin' bud... I'm gonna get her warmed up. And good and ready, to teach her some manners! Leave him! Leave him! Look out! Mr. Marlowe! Mr. Marlo-- *Ugh* *Ahhhhh!* Mr. Marlowe! Yes sir... I just love squeezin' tough guys like you. *Gut Shot!* *Gasps for Breath* Come on Token! Let's go! Is he dead? Yeah. Good. Gimmie my gun Reno... Reno, the gun! Sure... Sure man. You go right ahead. I don't know you! I never seen ya before! I never seen you at all! You were never here man! You were never here! Mr. Marlowe... What am I gonna do? Tomorrow I put you on a bus outta here. "Out of here." Where to? Back to... White Veil, Mississippi. Or where ever it is you come from. *Scoff* Oh yeah. There's not much there you know. Not if you're 18 and coloured. Well... *Sigh* At least there's not much chance of you endin' up like... *Liquor Flows* Like Molly Jackson. You're OK, you know that? *Chuckle* That's one opinion. You don't have to sleep on the couch... I mean, you did save my life. *Ahem* It's on the house kid. Is that scotch you got there? Goodnight Token. *Sighs* Token Ware had huddled up to me like a stray cat, all the way from Noon Street. ...It was the middle of the night, and she was in my bed... And I was finding it tough to remember, she was only a kid. Mr. Marlowe? Who was Molly Jackson? *Tsk* Oh just... Another one'a Trimmer's girls. I know she worked at the club because... Rose knew her. She told me once... That if I wasn't careful, I'd end up like Molly Jackson. Guess she didn't end up so good, huh? In the L.A. river... She'd been stabbed 11 times. No wonder that lady got so mad. What lady? The lady from the escort service that came to the club. Mr. Waltz said I'd be a... Big hit with the Blair crowd... A regular Molly Jackson... The lady got real mad! *Telephone Rings* Eaton residence. Voice: It's me. Trimmer, do you know what time it is?! Ah, you shut up and listen for once! Marlowe's got the girl. What?! You heard me. I gotta see ya. Oh, darling I'd love to see you but... Uhh, today's booked. What about Thursday for lunch? You cut it out Irma! If I'm in the dirt, you're down there with me! Now I'm comin' out there to see ya. -In and out, he's asleep. -Yeah ok. -Got that Trimmer? -Yeah, sure. *SLAM!* Oh my dearest. Oh, go back to sleep darling. Mr. Marlowe I-I-- Hang on kid, you've come this far. What the hell do you mean by this intrusion? It's him! Rupert Eaton! :) And who is this young lady? She's a fan. Which is big of her, considering she was supposed to take the heat... For your phoney publicity stunt! I can't imagine what you mean. You know Miss Ware, don't ya Irma? I never saw the girl before in my life. Yeah, at the club! You came to interview me. For your little escort service? You know about that? Isn't that right Eaton? No, no I don't. Come on Eaton! The little business Irma and Trimmer Waltz operate... Catering to the more bizarre tastes of movie personalities. Trimmer finds the girls, Irma delivers them to her clients... Michael Blair for instance. Throws a great party, Blair! I wasn't at that party. Shut up Rupert! But you know what happened there... I guess the case of Molly Jackson, just got opened again. You're wrong Marlowe! It's closed, finished. Just like you! Drop it. Drop it! I'm almost gonna miss you Marlowe... Almost. Leave the girl out of it, she won't talk. Yeah... You're right there. Not here Trimmer... It can't happen here. Your-- You're going to kill them? Grow up Rupert! They can put us all away! Yeah Rupert, fake extortion will get you 5-10... Hard time Rupert! Come on Eaton... You may not be the avenger of the high seas ...But I don't see you as a cold-blooded killer! I'll have no part of it! Drop that gun Mr. Waltz! No one is going to yell "cut" darling... Give me that thing, before you shoot yourself in the foot! Great Scott! I got him! Yeah... Nice shootin'. It was Trimmer! It was all Trimmer! Tell them Rupert! I don't know what you're talking about. We have to tell the truth now, Rupert. How Trimmer found out about your little games, and threatened to expose you! NO! I had to protect his reputation! It was a nightmare... It terrified me... He threatened me! That's not true! She gives the orders... She does the bossin' around. Shut up you little-- When was that Token? She came to the club, to see me about the party. You're a liar! Lieutenant! You took your sweet time Angus. Mmm...Rush hour traffic. They should do somethin' about it. Thank God you're here! You heard? More than enough... Looks like the avenger got winged... I'll call an ambulance... Come along, Miss Dean. What?! Don't tell me you're gonna believe that little slut?! It was Trimmer! It was all Trimmer! And you're going to be sorry about this. *UGH! OH!* You were so brave! Oh, no no, it's... Nothing my dear... Merely a flesh wound. I'd like you to know... I may be... over susceptible to the uh... Freshness of youth.. But I had nothing to do with the Michael Blair crowd... I've always treated my young ladies... Very nicely. Yeah, sure you did. How many years did he say I'd get? You saved our lives Eaton. I think we can keep you out of jail... Course the press'll have a field day. Thank you Marlowe. I'm... Very grateful. He's passed out! God, he's handsome. *Scoff* Well go ahead. Give em a kiss! Somethin' to tell your grand kids. Intercom: Bus now boarding for San Pedro... San Clemente, San Diego... As soon as you get to San Clemente, you call my sister. You got the number? She'll put ya up, and give you some work for a while... Just give it a try, will ya? I will, really. Intercom: Loading on platform 4... Thanks for everything! Get outta here kid! Who were we kidding? Token Ware would be back... The big dream doesn't die that easy... And everyday 100 other kids just like her would pack their bags... leave home and... Jump on the bus marked... "Noon Street."
