 It was Friday the 13th. I had been hit with a subpoena, to testify before the grand jury in the Shannon kill. And the traffic accident on the highway, had made me 20 minutes late. The last thing I needed right now, was to be cited for contempt of court. And your husband... Robert Shannon. Was appointed by the governor of the state of California. As special-prosecutor. To investigate any connection between, politicians

 and what is loosely termed "The Mob." Here in L.A. That is so. Now, Mrs. Shannon... I know this may be, painful for you. But I want you to tell the grand jury... in your own words. About the events which led up, to your husband's death. The Shannon case, was the hottest thing Lt. Magee had handled in 20 years. The governor's special-investigator had been killed, right under his nose. The newspapers were screaming, "The mob rules city hall!" And now the cockroaches, were starting to crawl out of the woodwork. You say your husband received, death threats? Who threatened your husband's life Mrs. Shannon?

 I don't know. There were telephone calls, in the middle of the night. If he did not stop the investigation, he would be killed. Please tell the grand jury, what you did. I talked to Lt. Magee... And he said... -Uh, thank you Mrs. Shannon. Lt. Magee will tell us what he said. Call Lt. Magee. Where in the hell, have you been Marlowe? Mrs. Shannon's already been on the stand. Sorry Violets, got stuck in traffic. -I don't wanna hear about it! You're late! And you're lucky the D.A. didn't ask you to testify first. -Lt. ? I'm coming! That can bring contempt of court! Is there a Mr. Marlowe here? Would you state, your name and occupation please? Det. Lt. Violets... Uhmmm... Victor Magee. On Aug. 4th... Did you receive a visit from Mrs. Shannon? Yes sir, I did. Please tell the grand jury, what was said at that meeting. Well I told Mrs. Shannon that... The police department, couldn't put a guard on her husband. Unless he himself, asked for it. This he refused to do. So I advised her to contact a private investigator. And what was his name? Philip Marlowe. Thank you Lt. call Philip Marlowe to the stand please. Philip Marlowe. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth? The whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help you God? I do. -Take the stand. Would you state your name and occupation please? Philip Marlowe. Private investigator. License, 137596. Did Mrs. Robert Shannon, come to your office in Hollywood on Aug. 5th? She did. And what passed between you at that meeting? She asked me to guard her husband's life, but she didn't want him to know about it. We... Agreed on a fee, and I accepted the job. Well how did you go about it? Every morning at 8:30, I followed him here, to his office. At the county hall... Followed him to lunch, and then back home again in the evening For how long did this continue? 3 days. On Aug. 9th. He broke his routine. Mr. Marlowe... Please tell the grand jury... Exactly what happened on that day. Instead of driving into town he... Drove west on Sunset Blvd. to the Bristol Circle, in Brentwood. And turned onto North Rockingham road. That's North Rockingham road, in Brentwood. What happened next? Outside #5-21, he slowed down and turned into the driveway. Did Mr. Shannon go inside the house? I don't know, I couldn't see. There were high hedges, so uhh... I drove a few yards past the house and stopped, so I could keep an eye on the entrance in the rear-view mirror. And how long did you remain there, observing the entrance to the driveway? Almost an hour. Then I got that... One minute to midnight feeling, so I left my car. And walked over to the driveway. And what did you see, in the driveway of... 5-2-1 North Rockingham road? Nothin'... Shannon's car was gone... If he had driven away, I would've spotted em. Was there any way out, around the back? No sir, not for a car. Where did you imagine, the car had vanished to? Well there was a garage. But it was padlocked, I stepped over to it, see if I could get a look inside, but I didn't get the chance. *Vicious Barking* *Bark* Lookin' fer somethin' ? Shannon! -Huh? Robert Shannon. Where is he? Visitor Manny? Killer, says he's lookin' for someone named Shannon. Who's Shannon? Yeah, who's Shannon? I was supposed to meet him here. 5-21 North Rockingham. There's a... South Rockingham, maybe that's the place. Yeah, South Rockingham... That's the place. You have a wrong address. Definitely a wrong address! You know something? You could be right. Believe it pal. Yeah, pal... *Snap* Believe it. I think I've seen him somewhere before. -Who is he Manny? I don't know. An hour later, I talked to Mrs. Shannon. She said before her husband had left that morning that... He'd received a phone call. He was excited because he thought he was on the verge of a breakthrough. He had arranged to meet someone, at 5-21 North Rockingham road. Yes, did uh, did she say who? No sir. And, did you take any further action? I asked Lt. Magee to arrange for a search warrant but... By the time he'd arrived there, the garage was empty, and the car was gone. Was the house itself occupied? No. The house had been empty for weeks, nobody lived there. And Robert Shannon's body... was found later that same evening. In his own car, At the foot of a ravine, in Topanga Canyon. *Murmuring* Now, Mr. Marlowe. Please think carefully, before you answer this question. Can you tell the grand jury... The names, of the men you spoke to, At 5-21 North Rockingham road? Only one of em. The guy with the eye-patch was Manny Tinnen. *Loud Murmuring* Thank you Mr. Marlowe. I think this is a good time, to adjourn for the weekend. Mr. Marlowe?! You'll present yourself here Monday, at 10AM Monday, to resume giving evidence. The grand jury is adjourned! Yes. *Phew* So did ya tell em the whole truth, so help you God? Yeah. -Think they'll indict? If there's any justice. Thank you, Mr. Marlowe. Justice, is about all I have left. I spotted Frank Dorr, outside the courtroom this morning. D'you know him? I know he's a picture you gotta see. If you want to open up a gambling joint or a boarding house. He's more than that Phil. A whole lot more. For 2 years now Frank Dorr has been up to his dirty neck in this political thing. Shannon found that out. Shannon's dead. So that's who Manny one-eye was workin' for, Frank Dorr. Not was Phil, is. I'm getting a lotta heat from the governor's mansion in Sacramento to nail Manny Tinnen, for this kill. So we can go after Dorr himself. And you're our only route. So you want me to say clear of dead-end alleys, until Monday? *Tsk* You want a man to watch your back? Oh I'll... Button-up my old coat when the wind blows free and... Try not to get a pain in my tum-tum. Magee was always a worrier. But he had set me thinkin'... Maybe I should take the weight off my feet for a couple of days. Poodle Springs might be a good place. Arrowhead maybe. Not that I was spooked, but there are times when courage is an overrated virtue. Could make trouble, and lead to all kinds of unsightly bruises. Hiya Phil. How'd you get in here Lou? Or need I ask? The door must've been unlocked. Maybe I had a key that fit it! Do ya mind? Lou Harger was a drifter, who had run a small-time gamblin' joint over on La Brea. Until the police shut him down, for not paying his dues. Hey! What's wrong? I just thought I had a better lock. I'd like it, if you parked it in the chair. *Chuckles* You still doin' business? *Sighs* I'm still doin' business, how 'bout you? Listen... I got somethin' for ya! Not a hell of a lot. But there's car fare in it. I'm listening. Well for 2 days now, I've had this itchy right palm. Luck! So I'm uh, makin' a little play, at La Calinda's tonight. Canalis' joint... I'd like a guy with a rod to cover my blindside. What kinda play? Crap table. Mmm... What else you gonna have in your right hand Lou? Besides an itch. Eyyy! You don't think I'd pop a shaver, do ya?! C'mon Phil, you've known me a long time. That's why I'm worried! On my mother's life. This is a straight play. OK, let's say I buy your cockamamy story, and believe that everything is aces! But Canalis' doesn't, and gets nasty! That's why I want a guy with a rod. And I'm takin Sally Glenn with me, for insurance. -Who? A tall red-head. She used to be a model! She's nice people, in any kind of a spot. I might as well level with ya Lou, I don't care too much for bodyguardin' Especially since I just lost a client. So how come you picked on me anyways? I thought we was friends... Seems I was wrong! See ya round! Ahhh hell! Pick-up my drinks tab, and pay for the gas. Thanks keed. I'll be there at 9. Don't pay anymore attention to me than you have to. That's the way, that's the way! "Get aboard boys! Speculatin', accumulation!" Come on dice! Nice! "...7 to 1, the hard way!..." Right, 3 grand. Play it the hard way! "He's got a hunch, he bets a bunch!" Do you know what you're doing? -I know what I'm doing. *Jargon* "And, the dice read 8!" That citizen's hotter than a Turkish bath! He's playin' with fistfuls now, not even countin' it! You don't play? Not on Friday's, I had some trouble on a Friday once. Do ya like that straight, or will I smooth it out for ya? What with? You got a wood rasp handy? 25 G's He-he, 25 G's! Here's yer hat. My my, isn't that something? Astonishing! I'll be back in a minute Lou, I'm just going to go to the little girls room. I wouldn't take too long Miss Glenn. Don't worry, I'll be right back! What are you driving? Blue Ford. Dark blue, Cali. plates RTM-4-40 Where's the car? End of the driveway, inside the gates. Alright you move on out, I'll cover your back. Right. Harger must've moved pretty fast! He wasn't on the driveway... I'd been just 10 yards behind him, and now he was gone. Maybe he'd cut out across the grass, makin' straight for his car but... Why would he do that, when Sally Glenn was still inside? This felt like trouble. Right in front of me stood a gorilla, in a hat. His size didn't worry me, but the .45 did. He seemed kinda familiar... Ugh... It was cold and... Somebody was playing billiards inside my head. Soft bruise, behind the left ear. No bleeding... But for some reason I'd been moved. And a long .38 was gone. Nothin' else, and that worried me. Friday the 13th had one more hour to run... And I needed a shot of mother's milk, to help me see it through. Losing track of clients was getting to be a habit! I rolled down through he hills, and back toward town. Past dead lookin' store fronts. One gas station with a... night bell, 2 cats and a drunk. There was one bar open, and it had my name on it. It also had Lou Harger's car out front. Dark blue Ford, RTM 4-40. Yeah? Canadian Club. Double. Little fellow in a tuxedo, with a red-head They show? Nobody's been here for an hour. Except him. *Hit Me Again* *Coins Rattle* That bus outside, is it yours? The Ford? My brother's. *Scoff* Your brother's a friend of mine, maybe I should buy you a drink. This doesn't have to be trouble. What's the beef? The guy who owns that heap out there doesn't have a brother. Sit down. I uhh... I didn't steal it! If you had, you wouldn't be sittin' in a bar with a hot car outside. Listen, I could lose my job over this! I'm a hack-driver, see I don't want no trouble! Just tell it! OK... I'm on my way home, When this Ford pulls-up along side me at a red. Who's in it? Uh, this guy and a Judy. Tall red-head, guy's about 30, in a tuxedo? Yeah, that's him! Guy offers me this 100, if I let him drive my hack back into town. I'm takin' his Ford to the Hotel Carilla, in Hollywood for him. My cab, will be parked there. Outside the hotel. That's where uh, the guy is takin' this Judy. What's his story? This uh, red-head... She's somebody's wife. The husband's tailin' em. I guess you're him huh? So you know I'm leveling. I'm nobody's husband. I'm a P.I. Show me your cards. Yeah... Tom Sneyd, Green-Top Cab Company. Your hack #'s 4-69? Well let's go get it! *Ahh* I'll tail ya into town. Listen, I don't want no trouble mister. So earn your 100. The hackie's story sounded crazy. Crazy enough to be true. It was the kind of stunt a guy like Lou Harger ...might dream up. To make sure nobody knew where he was. Not even me. And with 25 G's in his pocket, he might not give a damn, who got hurt. Hey, where's my cab?! Said he'd leave it right here. Front of the hotel. I could get... Letting someone else drive my cab. I could lose my hack license! I got a wife and kid! Yeah, alright... You wait here. *Knock-Knock* You got a Mr. Harger registered here? Harger? Not in. He been back this evenin' ? Not since he left. About-about 8. Put my card in his box, will ya? Sure. Thanks. Nobody home. Well what am I gonna do? *Shoe Scuff* Stick around for a while, if he doesn't show up. Report your hack stolen. Well how am I supposed to get home?! Call a cab! I called the hotel, twice that night. No, Mr. Harger hadn't shown yet. So I went to the office early and try'd to get a line on the red-head, Sally Glenn. I called model agencies, the screen extras guild. Even called a friend in the L.A. vice squad Sally Glenn? No dice. Probably wasn't her square moniker anyway. By 9:15 I was runnin' outta ideas. Then I started to figure it, another way. Maybe Harger, wasn't in trouble at all! Maybe the guy with the problem, was sittin' right here in my chair. *Ring* Magee. Violets, it's Marlowe. You know a dice player, name of Lou Harger? Little guy... thinks he's a big-shot. -Yeah, he's a moron. What about em? 25 G's ?! You were body-guarding him, how come? I got sapped, outside the casino. And somebody lifted my .38 Harger switched his Ford for a cab. Gave the hackie a C-note, and hasn't shown since Why are you telling me all this?! I thought you might do me a favour. You want me to send out a APB on the cab, huh? What's their damn #? Green-Top 4-69. Thanks Violets, I'll see you in court. Good morning. Lou said, if ever I got caught in the rain ...you'd be the man to see. Well it's raining hard where I am Mr. Marlowe! Come on in, and tell me about it. Lou's money. He told me to give it to you for safe-keeping. Where is he? Keeping his head down till the heats off. What heat? Lou played with loaded dice last night! Oh, you don't say? They found out. Now they want his head on a platter. Who's they? Canalis. Guy who owns the casino? Yeah. So when did Lou, give you this money? Last night, right after we got back. -Then he... drove off alone, in his car. Yeah... He wouldn't tell me where he was going. Said it was better that way, then nobody-- --Then nobody could sweat it out of me. They could try! I know. I haven't been back to my apt. yet. I'm too scared. You live alone? - ...Yes. I just don't know what to do! Maybe uh, I could... Put you up at my place for a couple of days *Tsk* I'd just be a nuisance. Well it might be nice to... Hear somebody's voice in my apt. besides my own. I think that's one of the saddest things I've ever heard. Well... Let's go buy you a tooth-brush! Lou was right about you, you're a hell of a guy! I know... Heart as big as an olive pit. Shangri La! I can tell you're a bachelor. *Chuckle* Yeah, uh... *Ahem* Well uhh, kitchen... in there... bedroom, through that door. I'll flop in here. There you see, I'm being a nuisance already Well we can, make any other arrangements you might like... *Swoon* *Phone Rings* Excuse me. Marlowe. -That hack you called me about... Auto theft. Found it this morning at the airport. With Lou Harger's body in it. Thanks Violets, I'll be in touch. Hey! Where you goin'? If the phone rings, don't answer it. Oh and um, Don't move the black knight. *Whistling* *3 Knocks* Hello Charlie! How's business? Stone dead. *Chuckles* How ya doin' pal? Alright. Hear you got a new lodger, name of Harger? How do you do it Phil? You almost arrived before he did! D'you know him? Well maybe I can I.D. him for ya. Save me a lot of time if you could. All I've got so far is the wallet and stuff You want to take a look? -Yeah! What's your interest? In Harger? Used to be a client of mine. Oh, sorry to hear that Phil. You got the slug that killed him? In the office... For ballistics on Monday. *Slab Rolls* That him? You wanna give me the formal I.D.? It's Harger. Is he a friend of yours? Some... How long has he been dead? About 12 hours. Straight through the heart. Point blank. Powder burns came through his shirt I'll lay 8-5 you dug a long .38 out of him. How'd you know that? Just guessin'... Slugs in the office if you want to see it. -Thanks Charlie! *Bottles Jingle* Do you want a beer? Uh, yeah. I'll uh... Be down a little later this afternoon. Ya, I'll see ya. How bout some coffee then? No thanks Charlie! Got a date. Don't ya wanna see that slug? I've probably seen it already. *Door Chain Locked* Open up Sally, it's me. Nobody here, but us reception committee. What's the angle? Business. Why the snatch? -I told ya! Business. The big boy wants to see you. Canalis? - *Stammers* Canalis?! Ha-ha-ha-ha! You 2 bit nothin'! I said the big boy! *ha* Canalis. HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Eyy! Shut up! I knew the laughing gorilla from that day at 5-21 North Rockingham with one-eye'd Manny Tinnen. If it was him outside the casino last night I had a pretty good idea who big boy was. But somethin' told me there wouldn't be too much laughing on the inside. Thank you Mr. Pobey. Take a seat, Mr. Marlowe! Beautiful up here isn't it? Fresh air. Solitude... Here a man can think. Very impressive. Do all your guests arrive this way? It was simpler than arguing... You know who I am? Saw ya outside the grand jury hearing yesterday. What's my name? You got a sudden case of amnesia? I'm Frank Dorr, Mr. Marlowe. And we'll get along better if you leave the wise-cracks in the back alleys you normally frequent! Perhaps you'd like to pour us a drink? Scotch whiskey, for me... Yesterday you identified Manny Tinnen to the grand jury. *Tsk-Tsk* It won't do, Mr. Marlowe. Shall I tell you why it won't do? Put you in the picture... No thanks, If I'm not in the picture, I can't be framed. But you already are! Mr. Marlowe. And most convincingly... Lou Harger was sent to his redemption by a bullet from a long .38 Your long .38! *Chuckle* So you see, you are in the picture. Maybe he got tired of life. Hit me on the head, and shot himself. And maybe you killed him for his money! You do have his money, don't you? Money alone is not enough for a murder conviction, I grant you. But the money, and your gun... would send you to the steam bath. Alright Dorr, you've laid the groundwork nicely. Now lets get off the dime! On Monday you will retract your testimony against Manny Tinnen. By pleading congenital confusion? You're intelligent enough to decide how Mr. Marlowe. Your gun will be returned to you. And as a reward, you may keep the $25 000. If however you decide otherwise. My .38 finds it's way to the D.A.'s office? Exactly! *Chuckle* Our discussion is at an end I think. No dice. You're forgettin' who Tinnen killed! The governor's special-investigator. Sacramento want's it's star witness kept clean. The D.A.'ll throw out this bum-rap in an hour. You just talked your life away! Gah! Pobey! Drop em! Or I snap his neck! Tell em Dorr! Do it! *tsss* Do as he says! Alright, back off! Slow and easy! *Ga-Le-la-gabluh-kss* Owff! Get up against the wall. Move! Gimmie that! I'm goin' after em! *Brakes Screech* Good Brakes! Guess I was, pretty lucky, huh? Hey! Wait a minute! You don't mind if I, come along with you. Do ya? Just a couple miles, I'll... pay for the gas. *Stammers* Hey you mind tellin' me what's goin' on? We're goin' on! -Huh? You and me! We're going onto the next intersection, OK? Say, what were you doin' back there anyway? Uh, pickin' flowers. I'm a florist. With a gun?! Hey! I know what you are, you're a G-man right? Yeah, I saw this movie once. A guy just like you. He runs into this bar! -Can't this thing go any faster here?!! -And starts blasting everybody! A G-man, yeah. His name was Adam. Adam something... What's your name? Violets. Violets? Violets Magee. It was worse for my old man, his name was Hyacinth. We're all florists. Hey! You wanna keep your eye on the road here? Huh? Oh yeah! Sure-sure. G-man... Oh wow! You know somethin' dreamboat? This is crazy! *Laughter* Ha-ha! Fun though, huh? Oh yeah! Well? -I-I don't get it. He just disappeared! Forget it. Concentrate on the girl. I want Marlowe, in court on Monday. Broken. Don't worry, he will be. Get out. Close the door! *Lays Fish Food* This is Frank Dorr. May I speak to the senator please? Good afternoon sir! I hope I'm not disturbing you. Senator! Relax. There will be no indictment on Monday. Nothing to link you or the mayor, with us. *Heh* But uh, I am afraid it may... cost a little more. As a bluff... Mine was thinner than the gold on a weekend wedding ring. I didn't believe all that hooey, I gave Dorr about the murder wrap not stickin' Thanks! Call anytime! The first thing I had to do was get rid of all that money in my filing cabinet. I decided to mail the 25G's to myself. At the main L.A. post office, general delivery Pick it up Monday. After the grand jury hearing. I wouldn't have to bother. Had a good week, huh kid? Must've been a lot of wandering husbands you collected this week. You got a paper for this bust-in? Don't get legal with me Marlowe. You should say 2 Our Father's and 3 Hail Mary's You're not in the slammer already! You told me you body-guarded Harger last night. You told me that he had a big win! 25 G's !! You told me your .38 was lifted! But now Harger has a .38 slug in him, And you got the 25 G's. If I had killed Harger... Would I have told you everything that ties me to it? Sure! To get out for ya, if your piece turns up. You don't love me anymore Violets! I got a feeling I'm gonna love you all the way to death row. *Chuckle* C'mon Violets! I've been framed! Dorr's got my .38! On Monday I go onto the witness stand, retract in front of the grand jury I get my piece back. If not the D.A. get's my .38 Your story plays like pea soup Phil. But I'm gonna better the odds for ya! Let's go get that hackie, while his memory is still fresh. OK, let's go. Take that back to the station-house. Listen Murphy, I don't care who's sick! Ya sign-in... Every time you come in. You understand me? That's your name you're on the page. Are you the dispatcher? -No I'm a priest. -Well Father, I'm looking for one of your drivers. Name of Tom Sneyd. Do you know where he is? Suddenly he's very popular. What's the beef? I ask you the questions! Oh-ho! Ha-ha! Sure! Sure! Yeah... Well he works nights, so I guess he's at home. 12-11 Renfrew drive, about 3 blocks from here. You know Renfrew? I know Renfrew. Hmm, uhh... Say, how many cabbies you got workin' here? I don't know 90-95. You know all their addresses? -Huh? -Well you came up with Sneyd's pretty quick And uh... Why'd you say he'd suddenly become very popular? Couple of other guys were lookin' for him a while back. Hmm? I don't care if she's dying! You sign-in! -Ahhh! -Use a hand! There's a hand and a pencil Renfrew Street! And step on it! *Siren Turns On* Drop em! Police! Cover me! *Ehuh* Hey! Doh! "Spoke" Andrews, Gun-work by the day, week or hour. I guess there was a living in it. For a while. -"Hey! What's goin' on down there?" -"Is it all over?" *Chatter* *It's Alright* C'mon, kid. "Damn neighborhood, keeps..." "Where were the cops?" -Oh my God, she's OK! -Is there any brandy in the house ma'am? Uh, no. Could you get him come coffee? *Cough* Now then, what's yer name son? Tom Sneyd. Did you ever see this man before? Last night. Tell me about it. He's a P.I. Tailin' a restless wife for the husband. The John gave me a C-note, to swap cars so uhh... He could shake this guy off their tail. Guy stole my cab, that's all I know. Did you see the doll? -Mmhmm. -What'd she look like? Tall. Red-head. A looker. Could you recognise her again? Sure, why? OK, Phil. Your story holds water. Who were those guys?! Why'd they try to kill me? Because you can identify the red-head. And if she's nailed. She'll talk! You better lock him up. -Why? -To keep him safe. The arrest of the cabbie, hit the evening papers. I figured the story would be on Frank Dorr's desk before the ink was dry! If the cabbie could identify Sally Glenn. Dorr would want her out of circulation, post-haste! I counted on her panicking and runnin' to the cops fer protection. *Door Buzzer* Or maybe that, Dorr couldn't find her. He had come lookin' for me. Help me Philip! Philip please-please let me in! Alright. *Sobbing* Sit down. *Glass Clinks* *Boo-Hoo* *Pours Liquor* Here... Sink it. Oh! *Shuddering* Help me, Philip. There's no-one I can turn to. Ho-what? Oh God! They're going to kill me. *Tsk* You are a talented lady angel. If I was a movie critic, I'd give you a rave notice! Don't you understand? Tonight, someone tried to kill me. Who? Frank Dorr. There's this man called Pobey. Why? I don't know... Cough it up sister or take your butt to the police, that's what they're paid for! No please! You don't know what they're like, they'll... Alright! Alright I'll tell you. What I said before was not the truth. Some of it, but not all of it. They made me lie to you. Just how much of it was the truth? Give it to me straight. From the top and maybe I'll help ya! But stop playing little boe peep, looking for her sheep. It all started when you testified against Manny Tinnen. Go on. There was no, big win at the casino. The whole thing was staged by Frank Dorr. Lou was given loaded dice, to play with so he couldn't lose. And I was given you. I was forced to frame you for robbery with Lou's money to discredit you with the grand jury. Lou was gonna testify against you. *Hmph* "My friend." Lou Harger. I never knew they were gonna frame you for murder Philip. I swear it! Yeah... So what was Harger afraid of? Why did he switch to the cab? To shake you. To make the story stick. That you were after the money. Then Lou Harger, gave you the win, to give to me. Yes. And then he drove himself to the airport? No... Dorr's men caught up with him. Shot him with your gun, and dumped him there. He never had a chance. God how I hate Frank Dorr! So why do you work for him? Once you work for Dorr... You never get away! That's how people know, who's handing out the favours. Dorr branded you? No... Frank wouldn't do a thing like that. Pobey did it for him. Don't get too lonely on that couch. *Oooh-Whooo* The big boy's expecting me. If he wasn't, you'd be dead! *Frisk* There's more muscle in this town than in a 50¢ steak! Clean. Make it short, Mr. Marlowe. I'm a busy man! You want the girl? I want my piece. I give you the girl, you give me my gun. Short enough? When? 8:00 my apartment. I hand you the girl... You hand me my .38, in person. You know the whole alphabet Pobey? Or just the letter D? Let me know when you get to M. I'll be waitin'. *Clock Ticking* *Door Buzzer* Come along Sally! No Frank! Just a short ride. -No Frank. Pl-please don't! Ahhh! -Not far! Freeze! Police! Just gimmie the chance Dorr! You frisk him yet? Saved that pleasure for you! The .38 that pushed Lou Harger across... in Mr. Frank Dorr's possession. Embarrassing, huh Frankie? Fella on the stairs, needs a meat wagon. Use the pay-phone. And take him with you. I'll catch up with ya later. Oh, yeah! *Wink* Thank you! Thank you-thank you-thank you! You know what that says? I'll do anything for you. Go anywhere with you if you want me. Sure... And you don't even have to pack a bag. It's just a 5... minute walk. To the Wilcocks Ave. police station. *Chuckle* You and Frank Dorr, make a terrific team! *Scoff* What are you saying? But, you make too many mistakes. You knew it was my gun that killed Harger, how? Simple. You squeezed the trigger! Oh, c'mon Phil. You've got it wrong! At the casino, when you said you had to go to the powder room. Harger waited in his car, and you waited until I was sapped. And my gun, was passed to you. But the one thing... That nobody counted on was this... Lou Harger never had any intention of handin' over that win. To you, to me or anybody else! That's why he switched to the cab. He had to shake me, but not for the reason you gave. He did it for this. 2 airplane tickets to Mexico City! One for Lou Harger... And one for Mrs. Lou Harger. Oh, he was gonna live it up, with you on that 25G's wasn't he? Only he never got any further than the airport because you drilled a hole in his heart with my .38 You wouldn't? Oh yeah! Listen to me Phil... Listen, Frank Dorr is finished with you, and I. We've got a future! We've got- -Is that what you told Lou Harger? -Harger?! But you're not in the same class! You wouldn't do this for Harger? He hired me to protect his life... It didn't do him much good. But by God I owe him. -You've got Dorr for that! -Nuh-uhhh! I've got Dorr and Tinnen for Shannon. And I have you... For Harger. And what about last night Phil, huh? What about last night? That was last night. The night before, you were the queen pin... in a machine, ticking over. To push me into the gas chamber! Sally Glenn got off with life. If she behaves herself... She could be out in 10. The 25G's were turned over, to the public administrator. And he allowed me a $200 fee. Plus $9.25 mileage. Sometimes I wonder, what he did with the rest. Yesterday a man named Candless... Disappeared at lunchtime. Next! on Philip Marlowe, Private Eye! His body washed up on the beach at midnight A big time lawyer takes a ride! -No! No! -That's shorter than he expected. You're not serious? Murder is. The clues point to revenge! -Chico will kill you for this! -I'm sure he will, move! But Marlowe isn't so sure! Parizi, couldn't kill time! Fine, you don't wanna hear about a couple of hitmen that just blew-in from Reno? And when the trail gets hot... He may just be the next victim! Of the deadly Nevada Gas! The stakes are high!
