 Hollywood, where they can turn on a typhoon like a faucet. And build a goddess, out of celluloid and newspaper headlines. Cut! Kill the rain. Hold the wind. Re-dress the set. -I'm sorry, I can't go on. -Is everything alright Miss Farr? No. What is it Rhonda? What's wrong? Nothing David. I felt a bit faint that's all. Can't have that. Why don't you sit down for a few minutes? "How gloriously understanding you always are darling." Isn't that from "Destiny Road" sweetheart? We'll shoot around Miss Farr, Howey! We'll wrap the movie on time David. I always come through for you don't I? Of course! It's Saturday I'm worried about.

 What? Our wedding? This Saturday. -Oh yes... -Really, you're not yourself today Rhonda. Oh well... Is- *Chuckle* Is an actress ever really herself? Everyone will be there Rhonda. The entire industry. You must be radiant! I always come through... David Bourne had snarled and kicked his way to the top of Magnus Studios. Money and power, he had. Marriage to Rhonda Farr would give him a royal flush. And guarantee her leading parts, well into her 40's. Who are you?! Who is this?! -Names Marlowe. -How did he get in here?! I used the door. How did you get in here? Well it was handy. I'm a-- I know what you are! I wanna know who you work for?! -That's confidential... -"Confidential." That scandal sheet! This is a closed set. You're trespassing. :) You can guarantee that nothing you saw or heard here gets into print... ...or I can call the cops. "Private Detective." You're still trespassing Mr. uhh... Philip Marlowe. I was hired to keep an eye out for your star. Oh really? By whom? Somebody... who cares... We all care, Mr. Marlowe. Miss Farr is very well looked after. You're neither needed nor wanted. Good day. Mr. Bourne? I bet she gets the guy back in the end, huh? Line up. Buy a ticket like everybody else. I don't wanna see you around here again! Howey?! Everyday, roses from Monsieur Landrey. Guy's nuts about me. "Dearest Rhonda, may you always be surrounded by the scant of roses." *Sigh* C'est romantique! It sounds like an ancient Chinese curse to me. Mademoiselle... *Sigh* Oh that guy doesn't know, when to call it quits! You used to like him, no? I used to like a lot of people. Champange pourasélle? No, just ugh-- Just go and tell David to have the car sent through. I'm through for the day. *Gin Sloshes* *Sigh of Relief* I knew what Rhonda's note said. Because I wrote it. "10 Grand will buy back some very interesting letters. Be at the Club Tango at 8:00." I had been hired by a guy named Lucky Landrey... ...to smoke out some blackmailers, who were leaning on the lady. (Business has been kinda slow) I thought I'd, push into the action. See what pushed back. Hello Tango! Surprised to see your reservation Marlowe. *Scoff* Looks like I needn't have bothered! You're outta' your class Marlowe. We only cater to the crème de la crème. *Ha!* In this dump it would curdle! Business slow since you split-up with Lucky? It's ancient history Marlowe. Why don't you keep your files up to date? *Murmuring* (Who's she?!) You'd better be paying with cash, Marlowe. That's good! But I kinda liked the blonde hair better. I don't like you at all! *Smoker's Cough/Laugh* D'you drink champagne? Of course. We'll split a Bollinger. And uh, scotch for me. Not that I planned to stick around. But you picked this joint. Gives me the creeps! Oh? I thought you might be comfortable among old friends. *Sulfur Fizz* You used to hang-out here, didn't you? What are you talking about? Before the studio told you, that Hollywood queens don't hold hands with gangsters. Who the hell are you? The guy who's been collecting your autograph. ...Now that collection's for sale. I don't believe you have any letters! *Scotch Whiff* They are gone. Somebody's got em. Why not me? *Scoff* If you read them you'd know they weren't worth $10... Let alone 10 Grand. There's hotter stuff in the Wall street Journal. It's not just the letters. It's who they're written to. Tell me. Lucky Landrey. The letters were stolen from his safe. And he's not uh, a guy you wanna be linked to. Just before you marry the crown prince of Magnus Studios You got the picture? Sure... Errol Flynn chases 16 year olds, and he's a Romeo. I date 2 guys in a row and I'm no good. I didn't write the morality clause in your contract. Listen mister! Marlowe. Philip Marlowe. I came here tonight to tell you, we will not be meeting again. I've had it with your pestering! And you don't seem to hear so good on the telephone! Wait... We never spoke before tonight. Hmm? You're not the guy that's been calling me? -Look Miss Farr. -No-ho-ho. Trying to blackmail me, is becoming a national pastime. The message is the same. No deal. I don't have any letters! I was hired to-- This is Morgan, he takes care of me. Morgan: And I can take care of you! So long, blackmailer! -Miss Farr... -Where ya goin' punk?! *Sigh* Get outta' my way. That's it! Drop the guns! Sure. Blackmailers Don't Shoot. Shootin's too straight for em. Hold it right there Marlowe! You, get outta here. *Scoff* Thanks Johnny, you're a pal. Down here in the shakedown racket now Marlowe? Sheesh. How low can you sink? You tell me. You live there. *Sigh* Miss Farr? Mmm-hmm? I could'a handled that guy. Sure you could. Miss Farr... *Deep Breath* Yeah? What is it? If you'd said the word. I would've killed em. I know it Morgan. You're the best. That's right I am... *Leather Straining* I am the best. It's good to have you around. OK? Now I'm really tired so... It's locked. Well unlock it! I thought we could, talk... Is it money? I know you're worth more than you get. I've been meaning to talk to em about that. No you haven't. Sure I have. I'll call em in the morning... Hell! I'll call em right now! It's not the money... What then? I think you could've... noticed me a little more... You could'a paid me, a little more attention. *Leather Squeak* I do notice you Morgan. Open the door. And I'll show you. I know you Morgan... You're somebody who's... Strong... But sensitive. Yeah, I feel things... You're somebody I could get, really close to... You don't mean it. Try me. Monique! *Muffled Screams* *Right in the Keister* *Seven Knocks* -What the hell is this?! -A gun. It goes boom-boom, people fall down. *He-he* Ya got one too, eh? Why don't you just carry a big sign that says: "Cop" ? MacDonald. Detective. Lookin' into a case of blackmail. I guess you were expecting me? *Soft Chuckle* No... You're a big surprise. I got her. Who do you think? Yeah... I got her. Here, my place. Sure, I mean... I ain't in no big rush. Rhonda Farr gets a message to me. "The blackmailer at Tango's place." Who shows up? You show up, what more can I say? You could tell me who you're workin' for! Huh... Rhonda Farr didn't call any cops! Who said she did? Maybe uh... We know a hell of a lot more than you think we know. That still wouldn't be much. Don't get too smart blackmailer! OK detective... Slap on the cuffs! Let's go down to headquarters! I'm turnin' myself in! Maybe uh... *Cough* I'll give you a break... I mean, your shakedown didn't play. There was no shakedown MacDonald. Not by me! I just threw a curve ball, to see who swung at it! What are you gettin' at?! You fell off the straight and narrow, right into the sewer. *Hammer Cocks* Put up the gun MacDonald... You may be a bad cop. But you're no murderer. *Dials Phone* *Damn Rotary!* Over the line: Yeah? This is Mac. There's a problem. What?! Slippy what?! Leaning on a guy is one thing, but that's out! Voice on line: You're out. OK, then I'm out! Voice on line: Get rid of em. Listen will you?! I'm deaf and I'm dumb... But I'm out! *Scoff* Hey, MacDonald? It's a hell of a lot easier to jump into the sewer, than to climb back out. Forget it Marlowe! You never seen me! And I never seen you. "Slippy..." *Telephone Rings* *Cough* *Smokers Hack* Marlowe. David Bourne. Is this the same Marlowe I kicked off the set yesterday? Yeah it's me. You were supposed to be looking after Rhonda Farr. Well not exactly. Well I must say, you did one hell of a good job! Rhonda's gone. I've got a movie to make. A huge wedding coming up... No star! No Bride! Slow down Bourne just tell me what-- She hasn't been seen since she left the set yesterday. She wasn't home last night! Is that so unusual? What's unusual... Is the phone call I received this morning. The gentleman said I'd have to, uh... "Dig up a whole lotta dough... If I wanted to see Rhonda alive again." Go on... Go on? Isn't that enough for you Marlowe? I've got a movie to make... My star's been kidnapped. My movie's a disaster! I want you down here right away. It's nice you're so worried about Miss Farr, Bourne. But I've already got a client, remember? Lucky Landrey had climbed the underworld ladder to the top. He had everything he wanted... Except Rhonda Farr. They had been lovers, back when her name was still Sally Spinks. Before fame and fortune called them up different paths. OK, go on. The gangster and the movie star... Just wouldn't play, not in real life. The only problem was... Nobody had told Landrey. Mr. Landrey is expecting you. -Right through here. -Thanks. It's early for you Marlowe. You got somethin' for me? Yeah, I got something. That's great. That feels great. Spell it out Marlowe. Slow down Landrey, I got some questions. C'mon you're making me tense! You know a cop named "MacDonald" ? I heard of em. He's crooked. Who does he work for? Anybody who'd buy em a drink. You? I don't have to stoop that low. I only buy from the top of the heap! You're stalling Marlowe. What about uhh... Slippy? Ring a bell? Slippy Morgan. Sure! He belongs to me. Morgan? The guy who walks behind Rhonda? Yeah, you got em. He's on sorta permanent loan to Rhonda... I can't trust those puff-balls at the studio to protect her. But you trust Morgan? Like I said... I own em. Not anymore Landrey. Rhonda's been kidnapped. Looks like your boy went into business for himself. Rhonda... Kidnapped?! Slippy Morgan! He's over! He's dead and buried! No matter how far they've gone I'll find them. I'll-- What? What is it? Slippy Morgan, he could always take care of himself... He's just a little short on smarts. Bastard! Spit it out Landrey! I mean... He ain't got too much imagination. I mean, I got a good idea where he's taken her. Benton get the car! The lady kept a little place of her own, out in the valley. For private visitors only. Rhonda's little love nest. I helped her find the place. We used to meet there. Once, twice a week. Since then I guess the guest list has gotten kinda long. You think she's in love with this creep, she's gonna marry? This David Bourne? I didn't say a word Landrey. That slimy creep! I could take em apart with one hand! I could buy em and sell em, 10X over and not notice! Mr. David "Big-Shot" Bourne! Cover me Marlowe, this one's mine! Landrey! Oh my God?! Come and look Landrey. Oh... My God I can't. Why not? Sally, I'm sorry. It's not your Sally. Who the hell is this guy?! Just a flatfoot that got into somethin' he couldn't handle... MacDonald. The bent cop... How did he end up in her bed? There's your letters' *Letters Rattle?* What's the problem? That's what you wanted isn't it? What have I done? *Scoff* That charge of the light brigade routine was meant to impress an audience of one And it wasn't me! Valentino to the rescue! Rhonda Farr eternally grateful... Fade out. You're right I gave Morgan the letters and told em to bring Rhonda here. Why?! To win her back from Bourne?! She's gonna marry the guy this Saturday! She doesn't love him Landrey, it's just studio business. I know that! If she's to be married Marlowe. She's gotta marry me! So you made up the whole deal? A phoney blackmail! I thought she'd come to me for help. But she didn't, so you faked a kidnapping and hired me to make it look good... Playin' the big hero for your girl! Kid stuff! For God's sake Marley... You gotta help me! I'm not your patsy! If I stay in this... It's to help her... And I handle it my way from now on. Okay... What'll we do? You drop me at the studio... And you go home and have another massage. *Ringing* I must have absolute discretion. I figured you'd want it under wraps. I can't go public on this Marlowe. Mr. Bourne? There's too much at stake. A movie. On the line: Inaudible No Howard. Howard: Just let me know. Everything's fine. Howard: The dailys? The dailys are beautiful! Howard: How bout Rhonda? She has a little cold, that's all. Howard: OK. She works so hard. Howard: If you say so. Keep in touch. You were saying there's so much at stake. Well... I'm talking about Miss Farr's well-being. She happens to be my fiancée. Are you selling tickets to the wedding? *Pfft* Spare me the witticisms Marlowe. I just want to know what you think the kidnappers are likely to do next... You seem to be familiar, with the criminal mind. If they're professionals... They'll let you hang for a couple of days to soften you up... Then they'll call and arrange a pay-off. Hmm, seems simple enough. I didn't see you as the type, to pay-up like a lamb. I don't like it! If I didn't know when to cut my losses, I'd still be a clapperboy. Yes... I'll pay. Meaning, the studio will pay. Another telephone call Mr. Bourne. I am the studio. Intercom: Commissary will be closing in 5 minutes. Hello? Hannah darling! Did you like the hat? What? No no, a little delay. Hannah: Rhonda? A slight chill. Call me when you get the word. Marlowe... I want you to handle the pay-off. Like I said: "Call me." Marlowe! I want you on my pay-roll! I'm not for hire. Not by you! Don't forget that Bourne. *Ringing, Intercom Paging Bill Chavez* David? David? Are you there? Hello David? Sorry darling. Camera problems. :S *Suicide Door Slam* *5 Soft Knocks* Hi there. I'm sorry, but Miss Farr cannot see anyone. You'd be Monique? Ze mistress is at ze studio. 'Fraid not. Of course she is! I wanna see Morgan's place. Where is it? *Gasp* Not in here! He stays there. ^^^^^^ (In There) But wait! Oh là là! He's out with Miss Farr! You got a key? Of course I do. Come on then! You are a friend of uh... Mr. Morgan maybe? Oh Yeah! We go back a long way... The key. Soutenu. *Gasp* Zis màn... He is cràzy! Miss Farr didn't come back last night... Shé did! I'm on your side Monique! Miss Farr's got some trouble! I never like that Morgón... Never! He always look at her... ...Funny. Last night. She did come back! But she go out again. Did she often go out at night? With Morgan? Not with Morgón... She never look at him! Miss Farr she work so hard... Some nights she can't sleep... She was... Restless. So Morgan would take her out? Yes, to drivé. To meet men. Miss Farr she's like a goddess... She makes all your dreams come true! She gives évérything! Evérything! She shows the whole world what it means, this love. But for her, no love. Never! She's like a... Lionéss pácing in the cage. Sometime(s) at night, she escape... She go looking. But she never find love. Never. Morphine. He put you to sleep and took you away. Where? There's a place mademoiselle likes to go for umm... Romantic rendezvous? Yeah, already been there. I decided to take another look at Rhonda's love nest anyway. I didn't have any other leads. And Morgan could be playing the old shell game. Where would a sucker never look? The place he'd looked already. *Rhonda Grunts* Don't be scared Miss Farr. *Gasping for Breath* I don't carry champagne, sorry. I hate champagne! *Gulping with Relief* *Wrong Tube* *Gasp* So where are you taking me now? You're going home. So David paid up? No. He didn't? *Scoff* Well somebody did! Softly: Lucky... Lucky, ha! He got me in this mess, he should pay! Nobody paid Miss Farr. I don't get it. Who are you? A blackmailer, kidnapper, what?! Try private eye. A gum-heel? *Chuckles* Why the hell didn't you tell me? I did try at Tango's joint... But you were too busy sicking Slippy Morgan onto me. Slippy... Is that what they call em? It fits. Did he...... Hurt you? *Scoff, Chuckle* Ha, no... Oh no, he just half-strangled me. He stuck a needle in my leg, and he dragged me to God knows where... And then he stuck another needle in my other leg! Miss Farr. If you really are a good guy... Call me Rhonda... And no he didn't hurt me. But I'm right off this dump! I can tell you that. Ha-Ha! Well let's get outta here! Can you walk? Sure. Oh! Say... You saved my life and I don't even know your name. Philip. Thanks Philip. Ahhhhh! *Wack!* You figured out where she was, you found her... and then you let em take her away from ya? That's about the size of it. You call yourself a detective?! Uh I've been calling myself a lot of things I don't believe this! OK Landrey, you've made your point. Let's not forget who started this mess. Yeah, yeah, OK, OK. *Glass Clinks, Liquor Sloshes* How was she? I told you. Tell me again. *Liquor Smack* *Ahh* *Scoff* She was holdin' up pretty good. She's a tough lady. She's a star. *Nose Exhale* Look Landrey... He's gotta deliver her safe and sound. Or he doesn't get paid-off. You'll tell me when they get in touch with you? Maybe you should keep out of it. You'll tell me Marlowe? *Cries* *More Sorrow* Oh! Don't gag me please. I won't scream. There's nobody to hear. Wait... This used to be my dressing room from-- "Frontier Friar" Yeah... You remember. That's when Mr. Landrey first sent me to look after you. *Scoff* That's a laugh. What'd you mean Miss Farr? Nothing. I do look after you! Don't I? Sure you do. I shouldn'ta left you alone, I know. I had to go talk to the boss! It's okay Morgan. You know that Marlowe was mulling you around... I shouldn'ta listened to you. I shoulda finished em off! No! You don't want to kill anybody! It's the chair for murder! It's the same for kidnapping. I told you. No one will ever know you kidnapped me... David'll pay! I won't say anything, why should I? I don't know. What'da ya mean? It's all set-up isn't it? I thought you were startin' to like me a bit better. I am... -I do but-- -Bourne doesn't deserve you! He don't love you like I do. The chair is fine! The chair is beautiful! Can we get going?! Let's go love. Director: Lights! Roll sound! Roll camera! China Gold 169, take 25. *Clap* Action! Ugh! How did I get into this jam? ... I should just get outta here! But I can't seem to get that... -Big lug off my mind... -Missy! -Yeah?! -NO!!!! Cut. What? Don't turn Stella. We don't wanna see your face, remember? Oh! Gee I'm sorry Mr. Burn. And-and you're still acting. Don't. We're not using your voice. Okay! In fact, don't say anything. Just stand there and think the lines. Can you do that for me? Think the lines. Okay! Yes! Yeah, OK! -OK -Think the lines. OK thanks! Thanks Mr. Burn! Roll em! China Gold 169, take 26. *Clap!* Action. How did I get into this jam? I should just get outta here! -Missy! -Yes? Cut! Cut! Cut! Look... -Don't talk, think. Don't even think! -Better call lunch. LUNCH! Gee this is fun ain't it?! You don't believe in wasting time do ya? It's best to keep working... Though we're getting absolutely nowhere. I guess "the show must go on." ... Any news? Not yet. They're 10 minutes late. They're probably not so fussy about deadlines. An unfortunate choice of words, if I may say so. You got the money? I can get it. Mr. Bourne that telephone call! Quick, it's over here! Intercom: Mr. Fredricks call wardrobe. Bourne here. Voice on line: It's gonna cost you 100 Grand. $100 000?! Voice on line: Drop is at midnight. Yes I understand. You'll guarantee Miss Farr's safety? Voice on line: Sure, why not? OK. Midnight. You got a deal. You can handle that? Intercom: Miss Tyler call accounting. You haven't exactly distinguished yourself Marlowe! So you deliver the cash. Be a hero. Marlowe! Oh lord, I suppose I'm stuck with ya. *Vigorous Knocking* *Vigorous Knocking* Marlowe! Landrey. -What the hell a-- -I told ya to call me! What are you talking about?! Come on Marlowe! It's set-up isn't it?! Who says so?! The radio! A press release! From Magnus Studios... Miss Rhonda Farr has made a complete recovery... She'll be on the set of China Gold tomorrow. I said call me. And I said I'd handle it my way! Forget it Marlowe! I'm here now, I'll stick with ya till it's over! I got her into this spot... I gotta see her safe out of it. Please. *Tsk* No artillery, you got that? I told ya, I'd let ya run the show. Stay invisible! If I need ya I'll shout. *Hammer Clicks* Morgan?! Morgan?!! Morgan? That you Marlowe? Come into the light. Come into the light! Now throw down your gun. I want to see the lady. You alright? Pay em, and let's get outta here! The gun! Good. That's good. Now the money. Let her go first. Come on! Miss Farr. It's over Morgan. I told you didn't I? I said Bourne wouldn't dare show his face! Take your money and go! *Hammer Cocks in Distance* Get the money! Johnny Tango! Jack of all trades! I could say the same about you... Seamus. I'll slice ya Tango! You here too Lucky? That's perfect! I'll gut you! Come out where I can see ya! I got my gun, pointed right at your true love's head. The money Morgan, throw it up here! Satisfied now Tango? Yeah, I'm satisfied... You stabbed me in the back Landrey. Dumped me. When the big times, was just around the corner. Now I'm gonna get even. Now I'm the winner. You're a dead man. You'da gotten away with it too... Only you had to get stuck with some dame. Sent your boy to look after her. *Cackles* Only he wasn't your boy, he was mine! Did you suffer Landrey? He went through hell... That'd been enough for me. Now I come out of it with a... A tidy profit in the bargain. Cover the lady. You son of a bitch! It's movie money! No! She belongs to me! You're mine now Miss Farr. I'll look after you! Just like we did before! Lucky! Lucky-y-y! Lucky! *Crack Shot!* Marlowe! S-ally... Sally. *Wheezing Cough* She's OK Lucky. You saved her. Oh Lucky! $10 000 says you don't... Marry that son of a bitch. *Cough* Oh you fool... You beautiful fool. *Cries* *Gasp* *Boo-Hoo* Movie money... Movie money!! Piker! Awe gee honey... You could use a dame around this dump! All the time you were up river on the north plantation... I was trying to drown you in a bottle of rot-gut whisky. But you kept floatin' to the top mister. So... I guess it's for keeps. Huh? *Smooch* Cut! Print that one. You ought'a climb down, before you get dizzy half pint. It's a wrap! It's China Gold in the can! *Applause* *Chatter* Better get changed sweetheart, we've a lot to do before the wedding. Marlowe! What do you want this time? Just dropped by to wish you luck on your wedding... From what I've read, it looks like it's going to be quite a production. So you came for your money after all. Is that it? Stop by the office on your way out. Make it a cheque Bourne. Your cash bounces. The delivery boy say: "Monsieur Landrey... Pay in advancé." Get em outta here! Give em to the gals in make-up. Why Philip! What a wonderful surprise! I thought we were meeting later at my place Yeah, I got your note. I was surprised myself. Because of David? I can't stand him... He's such a rat! But you're still marrying him? Of course! It'll do me good. And anyway, nobody stays married forever. Besides... I think we can find a lot better things to talk about. There are 4 guys laid out on slabs Rhonda. Well... You can't blame me for that. Anyway, they were all crooks. Well, weren't they? Lucky Landrey may have been a crook... But he had class. Maybe too much. The happy ending. Hollywood style. Bourne got himself some great publicity... And Rhonda was free to break more hearts. Even Landrey went out smiling... Still believing his goddess of love, cared if he lived or died. These subtitles take many hours. I hope you enjoyed! R.I.P. Powers Boothe
