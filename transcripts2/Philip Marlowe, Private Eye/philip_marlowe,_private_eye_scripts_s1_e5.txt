 Usually it's so quiet in Bev. Hills, you can hear the scratch of a fountain pen... on a movie contract, 3 mansions away. But not this mansion... Not today. "Go! Go! Go! Give em hell! Give em hell! Yo! Yo! Yo!" *Cheering Continues* Behind those gates. In a bed made for Knute Rockne. One'a the biggest stars in Hollywood, was recovering from what his Dr. called a "California Cold." Hero of the celluloid canvas. The rah-rah movie king to end them all. Sonny Wallace himself.

 Among Hollywood's 400, only a handful readied the full-time attention, of filmland's top medicine man. Dr. Charles William Sutro. Mr. Denny, quieten those fans again will you? We keep trying Dr. How's the patient Doc? Is he gonna make the premiere tonight? Patient's fine Mr. Marlowe. Shouldn't you be out there checking for stray press-men? With electric fences? All the news harks I know, can hardly climb onto a bar stool. I was under the impression you were being paid. I check every 15 mins Dr. Sutro. I don't want any intruders Marlowe. Press or otherwise. Do I make myself clear? Crystal.

 When an ordinary mortal has a head-cold... Aspirin and an early night are all he gets. Movie stars are not ordinary mortals. Maybe they don't even have ordinary colds. Keep your hands off! That's the way infection spreads. What infection? Nurse Dalton, what infection? *Dog Munching* Get out! Get out of here! What's wrong? Patient lost his appetite? Doctor! Dr. Sutro! "Dr. Sutro, please come quickly!" "Dr. !!" "Dr. !" *Crowd Cheering Outside* Marlowe! Marlowe!! Who gave you permission to enter that room? You can drop the act Sutro. How dare you? I will not tolerate an ignoramus like you interfering in medical matters. Less of your crap will go further Dr. Sutro That man's been dead for hours! What's the game? Leave us nurse Dalton. You've had your pause, come through. Marlowe, we're both working towards the same end. You're here to provide security back-up for the premiere and I find myself... In sole charge of a very delicate situation I don't know what your talkin' about. All I know is, it's too long. How long has he been dead? I am paid by Walden, Marlowe. So are you I'm not prepared to say anything further. Your questions must be addressed to him. Walden knows? Of course Walden knows! I'd been hired to guard-dog Sonny, by his producer Derek Walden. One'a the biggest wheels, this side of Cecil B. DeMille. He had discovered Sonny Wallace in the USC backfield And built him. Grin by grin, into one'a the hottest things since Doug Fairbanks. And all that on only 3 expressions. Looking left. Looking right. And looking straight ahead. Well, now he was lookin' nowhere... And in 9 hours, was due to attend his own premiere. There was somethin' else too... Sonny Wallace's face had been as yellow as a lemon. Suddenly I felt like I was taking a trip down a sewer, in a glass bottom boat. In the movies there are only 2 classes of picture. First class, and no class. A series of flops had worn Magnus Studios balance sheet kinda thin... And they were countin' on Sonny's fans to go hog-wild... And boost their box-office. If they were plannin' on some kinda cover-up until after the premiere... I wanted out. Hollywood's the kinda town where they stick a knife in... Your back. And then have you arrested for carrying a concealed weapon. I drove over to the Kilmarnock and the man who hired me. Derek Walden. "Spell out a story of success and tragedy" "Unequaled, since the days of Saul Robnitz" It's a unique picture, that's gonna get the audience where it lives. Where ever it lives! Out there in the Amazon basin... On the rolling plains, and the great nations and cities of the world. That's who they love... Sonny Wallace. Sounds like it couldn't survive much improvement. When do we see Sonny? Louisa! *Heh* You'll be first in line. OK folks that's it, thank you. See you tonight. Do I get the exclusive? What a question! How many column inches? *Chatter* Sutro called me. I suppose you think I owe you an explanation? Yeah. Like how I got voted idiot of the year?! I don't need histrionics Marlowe. You were hired to guard a house. And keep the press at bay. I'd appreciate it, if you get back on the job. I don't stay on cases when I'm not told the facts... You owe me 100 bucks, so pay up! Don't take that high moral tone with me Marlowe. You were being paid to make a few motions. That didn't mean much, at a time of great tragedy. A clean job. As far as your racket goes! Now that's a crack I can do without. But money you can't do without, can you? All I want is what I'm owed. You owe me somethin' else too. What did he die of? That's none of yer damn business. Heh... You're right. It's the coroner's business. Marlowe... I don't think you understand what's at stake here. Timing is crucial. *Scoff* But money is everything. Has the death even been registered? Dr. Sutro's taking care of that. I think you'll find this, to your satisfaction. 500? I'd appreciate it if you didn't talk to anyone. Until after we've made an announcement. You keep it. Buy yourself another "column inch." Excuse me. "Maybe I'll take a drink when I feel like it, and that's that!!" "Listen, I can shove you, and you can get outta this can..." "You can go and look for another job!" "What the hell are you talking about?! Who do you think you are, my mother?!" 6-4 Sonny Wallace hadn't died of leprosy... And my guess was he'd been dead, before Walden even hired me. By walking out, I had lost a day's pay but... What the hell ! I dropped by "Sing's Laundry" for some clean shirts. And got back to my office around 12:30. The phone was ringin' Marlowe. I'm listenin' I'm sorry I flew off the handle like that. but uh... Well we've all been under considerable stress, here in the last few hours. And um, after all we're both... In a similar position in this matter. Skip the warm-up Sutro, and speak your piece. Well I'd like you to come over, and see me if you can. Why don't you just say it on the phone? Well it's a delicate matter Marlowe. I'd rather tell you in total privacy. Besides, uh. There's something I want to show you. Alright, what's your address? It's 201 East Bellevue Drive. D'you know that? Yeah, alright. *Chuckles* Yeah. OK I'll see you in about an hour then. Alright. Bye. For an Aspirin peddler, Charles Sutro lived pretty high. In 10 years the miracle-medic of Beverly Hills had built himself... A reputation second to none. If you believed the gossip, he could cure anything. From delirium tremens to a broken promise. His patients worshipped him. And no intimate party in Hollywood was complete without em. Like a street cleaner, after the big parade Sutro always cleared up the mess. At a price. But best of all. No outsiders ever got to hear the details. Thank you for coming Marlowe. What did you wanna show me? Sonny Wallace's death certificate. I thought you'd like to know, why that fit young man died so suddenly. Pneumonic infection? -He died on pneumonia? -Pneumococcus. Worst example I've seen... Too advanced, even for the sulfonamides. -If I even called earlier, I could've... -*Sigh* Doctor... I've never seen anyone who died of pneumonia. But I once saw a guy who died of... Hepatitis... What does that have to do with Sonny Wallace? You tell me. They both had yellow skin! Marlowe. After death, blood drains to the lower part of the body. -Was Sonny face up when you saw him? -You know he was... What you saw was the normal colour, which results from that. Nothing more. This... certificate. It doesn’t have a signature and... There's no date on it. Were you plannin' on gettin' a second opinion? No! Why should I? Would you mind if... Somebody else took a look at the body? Not at all... You wanna call another Dr. Go right ahead! No... It won't be necessary. Well I guess it's... My turn to apologise. Don't think anymore about it! Drink? No thanks, I've uh, got some things to do. Well anytime you need a Dr. Thanks Doc. *Drunken Mumbling* Ahh! *Tee-Hee* Oh uh... This is my wife. Mrs. Sutro. Mr. Marlowe was just leaving dear. Mmmm? -Elizabeth... -*Gulp* *Chuckle* *Glass Shatters* *Laughter* Oh why are you leaving Mr. Marlowe?! When you could have a whole lot of fun! Charles wouldn't mind... -Would you Charles? -Elizabeth... Mr. Marlowe has to get back to his office. Oh! That's right Mrs. Sutro, I... Hope we meet again soon. Oh! You bet yer neck! Nobody comes here just the once. Is that so? That is, definitely so. I'll see you out Marlowe. That's alright, I can... Find my own way out. Mrs. Sutro. God, Elizabeth... Why do you do it? *Heh* Because I hate you. *Blah Blah Blah* *Blah Blah Blah* Maybe Sutro was tellin' the truth. And maybe that... Yellow look, was a trick of the light. But in my business, you spend half yer time strippin' away lies. And findin' bigger lies underneath. One thing I knew for sure... Havin' a Dr. for a husband wasn't helping Mrs. Sutro's particular problem. A case of Dr. heal thy wife. I needed one last look at the face, that launched 1000 pigskins. Then I'd stop wandering around, like a walking question mark... And find myself a nice, quiet, case. Phil! Thought you'd taken a powder! Doc. said you'd walked off the job. What job? Aww c'mon Phil, it was just a stall. Oh you knew he was dead too, huh?! Well... Being a studio cop, isn't always about watchin' a bunch'a girl extras... Trying to pinch each other's lipstick, Phil Ya ought'a see some of the screwy things I've seen these past 20 years. Draw me a map sometime. Hey, where ya goin'?! Phil wait a minute! Oh, it's you again. Where is he? They took him away. Kinda figured that! Do you know where? What I was tryin' to tell ya Phil. Took em out the back way about 12:30. To avoid the fans. Can you remember where, or is it too long ago? Don't be like that Phil! Echo hill. Archangel Mortuary... Guess he'll lie in state, like Valentino. *Scoff* 100 000 Women went to that one. Thanks Denny. Campbells Funeral Parlor in N.Y. ! That's where they took Valentino! The name on Sonny's death certificate had been his real name. Changin' was one'a the smartest moves he ever made. I wondered how many kids would've found it irresistible, to spend half their lives hollerin' "Go! Go! Smolak Wanski" Wade... Walton... Ah yes... Wanski. Yes indeed. He is here? Oh most certainly. Oh yes... Are ya preparing him? (Softly) No, no, no. The Dearly Beloved is ready. Ready? Oh yes... I'd like to see him if you don't mind? You are? In a hurry... -But the name is Marlowe. -Oh yes. Yes, indeed. This way please. *Curtain Motor Whirs* This is Mr. Wanski. I was just about to put him on the eternity shelf. -How long ago was he cremated? -2:15. Did you have full documentation? Oh yes-yes, of course! I would never dream of... Cremation without documentation. *Scoff* Thanks. Oh, if you wish to buy some flowers for the dearly beloved...sulfonamides We have a shop just around the corner. Wade, Walton, Wanski... Where are you? Goodnight sweet prince. Ah yes..... Indeed. I got back to Walden's apt. close to 4:30. In a couple of hours the crowds would start gathering on Hollywood Blvd. For Sonny Wallace's last picture. I wanted this thing ironed out in a hurry. And I wanted it ironed out flat. Well look what the cat threw-up. What are you doing here Murphy? Sgt. Murphy! I rank Sgt. now. I don't hardly talk to P.I.s Talk to this one. What's goin' on? C'mon inside. Keep yer mitts up where I can see em. *Scoff* When did this happen? Just before you came to collect, smart guy. Save the lip, and spit it out straight Murphy. Alright. Exhibit #1 You ever try that massive brain of yours on an ordinary conversation? Makin' about as much sense as a parrot on a drunk. You're all wet Seamus! I mean some people... Might think that you were shakin' this guy down. He could've been writing you cheques for months! He can't take it no more. He sticks one into himself and he breaks it off. *Scoff* That's nice Murphy, now let me try! He wrote me that cheque this morning and I pushed it right back at em. Cause I didn't like the job he offered. Then why'd you come back?! To make myself a suspect in somethin' I didn't even know had happened! Because this wasn't a suicide, was it? Oh! Educate a poor dumb cop, Marlowe. Did ya get around to checkin' the # on the gun? Or have you only been here all afternoon? What kinda wiseguy does a thing like that, just before he pumps one into his head? What, You mean the file #? -Yeah. -Well were waiting for you to uh, Straighten us out on that Marlowe. Did you check the inside? We are ahead of you, all the way on this small-time! Yeah sure the # on the inside's still there we put a trace on it 15 mins ago. So you think it was a kill? If it was a kill. It was a Smart Aleck Kill That was not a professional job. Then you don't need me. Now you hold it! Just as soon as I finish around here. I wanna know all about that job he offered ya I'm in the yellow pages. Be sure you stick around! Oh! uh... Who tipped you off to come here? *Chuckle* Wouldn't you like to find out. *Tsk* God! You are so tough! Mmm! Derek Walden had worked his way up, From the mail room. To 2 academy awards. He had 3 new pictures lined up. And no reason that I could see, to jump off the top of his life. His kind never do. They just can't seem to find the time. Hello again. I'm Mianne Crayle. You're Mr. Marlowe? That's what it says on the door. You have to help me. *Chuckle* Do I know it yet? Derek Walden's dead. How do you know that Miss Crayle? I found him. Come into the office. So, tell me. You saw me go in there this morning, didn't you? Go on. We had a fight. What about? Nothing serious. Just a tiff. You're Walden's girlfriend? I work for Magnus, publicity. And? I slammed out. Derek was drinking... He usually does before a premiere. But you went back? Yes, to make sure he was sober. For tonight. And there he was. Take your time. I went home. And called the police. I didn't leave my name. And then I realized that you were working for him. So I looked up your address, and here I am. Why didn't you leave your name? I guess I panicked. It looked like suicide... But it wasn't. Why not? Derek never owned a gun. The gun was in his right hand... And he was left-handed. How did you know that? Saw him write a cheque. OK Miss Crayle... I want you to go home and stay there. I'll call you what's your number? Marlowe. What does the name Burwand mean to you? B-U-R-W-A-N-D. Burwand? Nothin' why? The gun number checks? Sacramento says it was registered under the name of Dart Burwand. Seems he moved to N.Y. Can't help ya. Haven't had a regular supply of Burwands for years now. Look don't get fresh pal. I want you down at HQ at 9 tomorrow! *Receiver Miss* Helen Burwand? Who's she? There's a Helen Burwand who works at the studio. I need her address. The studio records dept. probably wouldn't give it to an outsider. You think they'd give it to you? I could try. Why don't you do that? Mianne Crayle didn't have to check the records office. The studio switchboard had the address I needed, right there on her night list. "Of course" they said, "Is there an emergency?" I drove Miss Crayle back to her apt. and rolled on over to 14-54... South Livesey. Home of Helen Burwand... The lady with the same name, as the owner of the gun that killed Derek Walden. *Knocks* Only these days Helen Burwand, had gone back to using her maiden name... Dalton. Nurse Dalton. Well, well... It's the dick... How 'bout buying a lady a drink? Why not? You get around, don't you? *Scoff, Chuckle* Yeah, some. *Giggles* Uhhh... This your... Ex-husband, Dart Burwand? Leave that alone! *Panting* *Chuckling* Well, now who could this be? Dr. Sutro auditioning for the part of Charles Lindbergh? What the hell do you want?! Where's your husband's gun? Little black automatic, left behind, when he left you? I think you're trying to tell me something, Miss Dalton. Like uh... Why you can't afford to live any better? You get out of here, you cheap crosser! Get your filthy hand's off me, you lousy flat-foot! You keep takin' that stuff, and they'll throw you into Mendocino for the cure! Cold turkey! What did you do with the gun?! I just showed you the gate, flat-foot! -And if you don't get out of here in 10... -Shut up, snow bird! I wanna know who had the gun, and tried to file the number off of it. *Gasp, Shudders* Was it this guy? Huh?! What's his name? Jean Harlow! (Lie) Nice friend's you got! This guy stitched a hem in my fender! Who is he?! Get out before I start yelling rape! In this neighbourhood, it wouldn't matter much. Alright, one more question... Who supplied the dirty needles that gave Sonny Wallace hepatitis? You?! -Leave me alone! -Sutro?!! Get out! Or was it this ape? Huh?! Cough yourself off! Nooooo!! That was mine! No! *Mumbling* *Agonizing Screams* Mine! No! Ugh! *Sobbing* No! *Horn Honk* *Indistinct Chatter* Yeah, Miss Crayle. It's Marlowe. I need your help. Will J.P. Magnus be at the premiere tonight? Of course! A bunch of us are meeting at his office at 7:30. And then we go on to the theatre and... *Scoff* I know you said to stay put. But I can't! I'm a Magnus employee. And I have to be at that premiere. Yeah, alright OK, I'll uhh... I'll take you over to the studio a lil' bit early... But I want you to do something for me. Can you fix it for me to see J.P. Magnus in private? Look, all I need is 10 minutes of his time. It's important. "Al Wallace takes a long-term option on the ball!" "And he sends an airmail express to Stuart, which signs the receipt for a touchdown!" "To give his team top billing on the scoreboard!" "Churcher about to receive the ball gets a bad pass from center!" "Chases it but loses 12 yards of precious territory!" "But the goal is where you find it! And he redeems himself..." "When he passes to Costello who's..." "across the zero strike with 6 points under his arm!" "Roaring back in the second half, Sonny Wallace pounds out..." "Yard after yard of football!" "Winding-up the game 22 to 7!" "Good luck in Hollywood Sonny! We're sure gonna to miss you here!" Come in Mr. Marlowe! Miss Crayle explained who you are. Please sit down. Ahh! I have three and one 1/2 minutes. You can speak freely, This room is sound-proof. This may... Come as a surprise to you, Mr. Magnus. -But Sonny Wallace was a... -Was a drug addict. You're wasting time! Well my guess is he died of hepatitis. But if he hadn't. The drugs would'a killed em in a couple years anyhow. He wouldn't be the first. Go on! How many, stars do you have, Mr. Magnus? Rather less than there are in heaven, I'm afraid. But your next question is: How many of them take drugs? And the answer is too many! *Tss* No sir! My next question is: Where do they get it from? And after that. How much does it cost you to cover it all up? All over the world young people imitate movie stars Mr. Marlowe. What the stars do... They do. Now our images on the screen may seem clean enough but... All the time the... Morals of Hollywood are more like those of "Port Said." And it's worth paying a little extra to obscure that fact. Don't you think? I can't disagree with ya. *Chuckle* Oh yes you can! It's the people who work for me who can't. Let's get to the point. You... Know this man? Ricchio Bannares, my son-in-law. You wanna tell me about em? I gave him a job here as head of security. It's a far bigger job than it sounds... Europe. The far East... Star name's crawling all over the globe, like ants. They need protection. Ricchio exploited them. You fired him? After he broke-up with my daughter, yes. But that wasn't why I fired em. When he got into business with Derek Walden They used Walden's yacht to bring in... Certain cargoes from Ensenada. Snowflakes? Such a delicate name for poison, don't you think? Let me come to the lump of the matter. Ricchio is small-fry. The one I want is... The one who controls him. The one who deals out black queens. Now get rid of that menace and I'll give you anything within my power! Do we understand each other? You know Walden's dead? How do you think I hold this whole empire together Mr. Marlowe? I know when an employee of mine, changes his socks. Where do I find Ricchio? Probably with his new girlfriend... Come to my office, I'll show you his file. (Inaudible) And then I kicked her. Hard! Ooh! *Swooning* *Shave and a Haircut Knock* Who is it?! -The Easter Bunny. -Quit foolin' Ricchio! Who the hell are you?! Never mind... I'm lookin' for Ricchio. Well he ain't here! This is a ladies room, now beat it! You heard the lady! Freeze it 2-bit and everything will be Jake Frisk em Denny! Sorry Phil. But you just don't stay told, do ya? -Who's doin' the tellin' Denny? -Shut up! You're liable to wake up in a pile of dirt. Only you won't wake up, get it?! Guess you know Denny, from your old days at the studio. -Right Ricchio? -Keep talkin' Seamus. I need the excuse to work you over. Cuff em Denny. I thought you was just a body-guard Phil... But you're a bright guy! You certainly had me fooled. *Chuckles* That wouldn't make me bright Denny. Take em out the back way. Make sure nobody sees ya! These people? 50¢ would button their lip, at the St. Valentine's day massacre. That guy wasn't here... You never saw Denny. You never saw me! When you look in that mirror... You probably won't even see yourself! Get it?! Ah... ! *Bottle Clunk* *Dope Clap* *Door Shuts* *Honk-Honk* -How bout lettin' me in on the act? -Too late Phil. Should'a kept yer head down. I gotta hand it to ya fellas... It's a nice set-up. Ricchio brings the stuff up from... Mexico on Walden's yacht... And Florence Nightingale pushes it around the studios. *Tsk* I'd have said you boys have got it made! Say all you like gum-heel. You're a dead man. Pull over Denny, I gotta call the boss. *Phone Rings* Sutro. Good, you can go ahead now. And Ricchio... No more mistakes. They've got Marlowe. Bring the boy down. *Ring* Yes? It seems I have little choice! How much do you want? And where do you want to have it paid? $200 000... Each year, for the next 5 years. In Mexico City. I will sign Sonny Wallace's... Death certificate, post-date it, and mail it to you direct. And my stars reputations will remain intact? More importantly the box-office will continue to roll in... From Sonny Wallace's films... Mr. Magnus, and that's what you really care about in the end isn't it? The fear that millions of movie goers will walk away from your ticket windows... If a drug scandal leaks out... And make no mistake... I'll leak it if I have to. I don't doubt it Sutro, not for one moment. So listen very carefully... Over the next few days, Sonny Wallace's cold will get worse. He will contract pneumonia. But the nurse will not recognise the symptoms. I will be in Mexico, and Sonny Wallace will die. His funeral will be colossal... And his ashes will become a shrine. All you have to do is shut you mouth... And sign the cheques. I never want to hear from you again! Yes... Yes, he'll do fine. He should. He was Sonny's double in 4 movies. Weren't ya Chuck? Yeah. Get him ready. Let's see how the boss is doin. *Tuning Radio* "Direct from the Finsburg Theatre, and standing next to me... Is J.P. Magnus himself!" "Mr. Magnus, will Sonny Wallace be here tonight?" "Nothing would please me more." Take the weight off your feet snoop! You're all washed up! "...Dr. has everything under control." "There's a rumor it's more serious than a cold." "Would you care to comment?" "I never listen to rumor. Excuse me." "Mr. movies himself, J.P. Magnus!" "And now Clarke Gable's arriving! Clarke Gable everybody!" "Here to lend his support to a young man... who's fast becoming one of his biggest rivals!" "A typical Hollywood gesture!" "There's something warm and generous about movie people..." "Something big hearted, clean and pure!" "An inspiration to this great nation of ours!" "And an example to the world!" And here comes Melanie! Yes it's Melanie Chase! Co-star with Sonny Wallace in 3 movies... and one of the hottest properties in tinsel town today! Oh I wish you folks at home could see this! Melanie Chase, looking every inch a star! As she steps out of her limousine... Into a solid wall of cheering fans and poses for those pressmen. And the crowd's really turning it on here tonight. For the first ever showing of... Varsity days! Over a year in the making. And the biggest picture Sonny Wallace has made so far ! "The youth of America's really got something to shout about!" "And they're sure letting the world know it here tonight." And throw em the pigskin, and do his wave. Inside turn sharp left. The nurse'll get you back to the house, and pay you off. You understand all that? Yeah... "Varsity Days! Ladies and gentlemen!" "Only the 5th film Sonny Wallace has made..." "And already there's one report of a dozen girls..." "Waiting in line, outside the theatre in N.Y." "Where the picture doesn't even open, for 3 days!" "Screen columnist Louisa Malcroft told me today that..." "That this is only the beginning, for Sonny Wallace and Magnus studios!" A partnership that has blossomed over just 5 movies... To bring much needed prosperity to the Magnus lot here in Hollywood. Get ready then. And there's a familiar limousine out there on the Blvd! And Yes! Yes it is! The man of the moment... Sonny Wallace himself approaching with Dr. Sutro by his side! And the crowd goes crazy! *Cheering Loudly* And the cheers go out for one of America's favorite sons! And wait a minute! This is really something! All of Sonny's co-stars are coming onto the red carpet outside the theatre! Right into a football huddle. As they zoom along from the sidewalk. And just listen to those fans! Go Sonny go! That's what they're yelling here tonight! For Sonny Wallace, America's clean living hero of the silver screen! As his team go into a flying wedge, and charge right into the theatre! Oh boy! Is this Hollywood! "*Laughs* Well that's it folks!" "The kids out here will remember this night for a long-long time. And so will we!" "This is Richard Billington outside the Finsburg Theatre for KPRC!" "From the heart of Hollywood!" "And now the music of Butch Mason..." "Bringing us up to NEWS time here on KPRC." "The station of the stars!" *Engine Turns Over* Go get the schmuck, and bring em out to the runway! What'da ya got in mind Ricchio? The boss can drop em out over the ocean. Wait a minute! I thought this was just till after the premiere? Nix on that baby! You wanna let em go so he can finger us?! I didn't contract for no strong arm play! Oh you're crazy as hell! Go back there, and stay with him! Let's go Phil. Aw Phil. What the hell you doing? Put that damn thing down! Sorry Denny... I thought I was in for trouble! Guess you're right at that. He's gonna drop you over the ocean. -Who is Denny? -The boss. Is that him now? -Right on time boss. -She warmed up? Yeah we got a problem. -What problem? -Marlowe. Denny doesn't want em croaked. I'll take care of Denny. Get the suitcase. Sure. *Sighs* I'm gonna have to leave you behind Elizabeth. I need the space for an unexpected passenger. Contact! Contact! Ricchio! Freeze! Freeze! Ahhhh! I couldn't, could I? I couldn't let it go on... All those people... Helen... Sonny... Even Derek Walden. My husband made them all... Ruins. Do you understand? Yeah... It was Ricchio who scratched out the number on nurse Dalton's gun. Then shot Derek Walden to keep him quiet. And it was Sutro who got careless with the needles and ended a star's career. But it was Mrs. Sutro they put away into Hatchaby... And they called her temporarily insane... Sometimes I wonder why they don't leave the crazy people alone... And send the wagon for the rest of us! (I hope you enjoyed the subtitles!) *Bow!*
