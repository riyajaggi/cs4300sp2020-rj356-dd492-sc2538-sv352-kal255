 The Brentmore country club, was one of those places... where they cut the grass with nail scissors You needed relatives on the committee, just to order a drink. And William Randolph Hearst... would've fainted at the value of their art collection. But among the lounging aristocrats, and faded millionaires... Some of the newer members, didn't fit the back drop. Men like Hugo Candless, a big time lawyer outta Reno. With an elegant wife, a mansion in Bel Air, and all the old-world charm, of a cop beatin' up a drunk.

 Want another licking? You're not as stupid as you look, Dial. Shower off yer sweat, and we'll talk business! *Laughs* To become a member of The Brentmore, Hugo Candless must've greased some very classy palms. Or maybe he found some interesting pictures of the chairman's daughter. Move yer ass! Either way, anybody hanging around Hugo on a Saturday morning, had to be short of friends, or on his pay-roll. George Dial, had plenty of friends. And that was somethin' his boss could never forgive. Anybody hangin' around the Wilcox Ave. police station, on a Saturday morning.

 Had to be a pimp puttin' up bail. A lost child, or a private dick. I didn't have any gold teeth, and was over 21 so... Once in a while, they gave me the benefit of the doubt. And threw me a case. When a cop like Violets Magee, calls you on a weekend. And tells you to come right over. There has to be a reason. I'da put $5 on loneliness. I know his brother died! Listen, everybody's brother dies sometime. Look that don't confirm no license, son. But this is a big operation, and I need him there! Tonight. Why don't you sit down, and put your hat on my desk. You sleep in this place?! Yeah. We got a visitor in town. Just out of San Quentin. Name of Parisi. "Mops" Parisi. Punch any bells? Sure. Gamblin' joint in Reno. Grand larceny in Frisco. 15 years in San Q. And paroled last week! Compassionate grounds. Uh-huh. Last Tuesday Parisi hit town, and last night he was out at the Club Egypt. Advising some party. On what? Balancing the wheel. Chico Zapparty runs roulette? Yeah. Where you been, desert island? Roosevelt got re-elected, the dollar got de-valued. And Chico Zapparty runs roulette! But that's my problem! You, got another one! Drink? No. I'd better keep a clear head. Well Parisi has been shooting his mouth off You were there arresting officer, weren't you? Me, and half the San Francisco police dept. Well, your lil' friend from Reno. He ain't forgot you. That's nice. What is it, when they stuff parrots with sawdust? Taxidermy. That's what Parisi, has in mind for you. Only with lead. *Scoff* Parisi couldn't kill time! Fine... Then you don't wanna hear about a couple a hitmen that just blew-in from Reno? Huh? *Phew* After that we'll buy out Lieberman. In 2 years, I'll be the biggest attorney, on the coast. Sounds like an exciting prospect. It won't be the way they taught you at Harvard, Dial. It'll take guts! You want me to come back with you? I think I can handle Esther by myself. George Dial had a very special problem. Women. A different girl for everyday of the week! I didn't know it then. But he had just started movin' in on one'a mine. Hey! You're early! And don't you just look terrific! Well thank you, kind sir! I hope you're hungry because they have excellent food here. Absolutely! Maddock, where the hell are you going?! Hey! You're going the wrong way! What's the matter with this thing? Hey! Are you deaf?! Turn around! You're going the wrong... What is this, Maddock? Who the hell are you?! Magee had told me to skip town. Leave Parisi to the cops, and get the hell out. Go up to Frisco, he said. See your old buddies... I told em, I was saving myself for the grand tour of Europe. When he laughed, his teeth rattled. Trust him, he said... By Monday, the hitmen would be back in Reno. And Parisi would be in the slammer. I went back to my executive suite to think. I'll tear you apart! I'll break you into little pieces! Turn this car around! What the hell are you doing?! No! No! No! No! I'll pay you! I'll make you rich! *Coughing* *Gahhh, Guh! Ugggh!* Mops Parisi was a 5¢ hood. With a $10 mouth! One'a nature's little guys. That can't get used to the idea. And I didn't like running away from a punk like that. But Magee had insisted. Well... Maybe I could see myself driving up the coast... Fresh air, and the open road. Then I had a better idea. *Laughter, Chatter* Your pardon, Mr. Dial sir. I have a call for Miss uh, Riordan. How did you know my name? Ma'am, I just know all the other ladies. And ain't none of them called Riorden. Thank you, Mr. Dial sir. Enjoy your lunch. When you think you belong. They let you know you don't. *Laughs* Aren't you going to pick it up? Hello? Philip! How did you know I was here? Oh, blood test, fingerprints. Usual routine *Chuckle* OK, I called your hairdresser. Women always tell their plans, to their hairdressers. Listen uh... I got an idea I'd like to throw at you over dinner. Oh, Philip, I already have a dinner engagement. How 'bout tomorrow? -No... Norma Shearer's party. Hold it, Philip. Norma Shearer? It was supposed to be a surprise. All the stars will be there! Philip, call me at home around 3:30, and then we can- We're due at the beach house at 3:00. What beach house? Marion Davies. One of my clients just closed a big deal with her. She'd like to pour a little champagne, chat around the pool. That sort of thing. *Pfft* Philip I'll call you later. Will you be at home? Okay... Goodbye. You keep a very full schedule, don't you? You only live once! Now, shall we order? I started tellin' myself, that all that leavin' town stuff was hooey! If someone wants you... Sooner or later they catch up with ya! Even a mug, like Mops Parisi. But I wasn't gonna sit around, waitin' for em to knock on the door. When a visitor blows into town, it's only good manners to knock on his door. Suitably dressed, as a sign of respect. *Knock* Hey, ain't you got a home to go to? *Tsk* It's all your's Carita. I was just on the way out. You meet up with those guys? What guys? Last night! I tell em you back Monday. Yeah, what'd they look like? One he, good-looking maybe. The other, not so much. Hey, you want a glass for that? Downstairs... I got glasses. I got another bottle Carita. Why don't you take this one to share it with your husband. Huh? That Sancho? Last week, he step out for cigarettes. Now he's living in San Bernardino. L.A. has it's own version of the 23rd Psalm My "pool" runnith over. People spent money as though they had it... to impress people they don't even like. And nobody understood this better than Chico Zapparty. Good evening Mr. Marlowe. Are you with the Gandalph party? Nope. Listen uhhh.... Park it close, will ya Max? Sure! Chico owned 3 hotels, a mailing company, and a radio station. But the jewel in his empire, was the club Egypt. Studio executives, syndicated journalists. Major talent agents. Sooner or later... Everybody who was nobody, passed through these doors. Gandalph party? Marlowe party. -Is Mops in tonight? -Huh? Little fat guy, name of Parisi. I'm a friend of his. Heh..... I'm a married woman mister. I check hats, that's all I do. I believe you. Marlowe?! What brings you here? 180 Lbs. of lard, About 5 foot nothin', with a big mouth! Parisi? I heard he was lookin' for me. Figures... Boy, the things he was sayin' about you last night! Yeah well, that was last night. Hell no! Goes on the account. What account? The Gandalph account. You're the back-up right? The protection? Is that what I look like, a hired gun? Hell no! But... If you want in on the action. Get in there already! Get in where? Where the long bar used to be. That's where they got the new business. Didn't anybody tell ya? No. But I'm sure of one thing... *Carefully Sips* *Spills Drink* Ahhh! If I was as thirsty as you people give me credit for, I'd be speaking to ya, from the inside the jar at the medical school! *Dials Phone* Lt. Magee please. Al Ginsburg, from the club Egypt. Lieutenant! Is Marlowe part of the Gandalph party? Which one is Marlowes' car? Blue Plymouth. *Air Escapes* Ah, relax fellas! How many customers we guarding tonight? You guys must be new here. *Hugph!* The name's Marlowe. I'm a friend of Chico's. And before you ask, I'm not with the Gandalph party, Now do I get in? Or do I call the boss? Guy's a P.I. ! The only difference between you and a monkey. Is you need a smaller hat. The muscle on the door was as green as Chico's roulette table. I figured I had maybe, 5 mins... Before they drifted back in. Hoping to unpress my suit. Unless Parisi had grown a foot taller, in the last 10 years. He wasn't in the room Neither was Chico Zapparty... I'da stepped right out again. If it hadn't been for one thing... Annie Riordan... *Roulette Wheel Ball Clatters* *French Gambling Jargon?* You got a losers license? *Sighs* How'd you find me this time? Well it wasn't easy. This thing doesn't have a habit, of hittin' on the evens does it? George! This is a friend of my hairdressers... Philip Marlowe. ;) George Dial... Annie this is the big one! It all goes on May-West, OK? Just keep it coming.... $300 of that's mine Don't you like it? Shhh! George has a system! So do they! Ya, I got a system. You got a system. Everybodies got a system. It doesn't work in this dump! *Cheaters Ball* Number 11 black. Muahahahaha! How much did we lose? *Tsk* Five. $5000? Mmmm (yes) Alright, that does it frog! That does it! This game is rigged! I'm sorry sir, you're mistaken. Oh yeah?! Yeah! And you're really French! This game is rigged, buddy and I want to see your boss! Right now! *French Jabber* That doesn't happen nowhere! This is rigged, 16X in a row, right lady?! *More French Blabber* Boss right now Frenchie! Back on the door boys. I'm handing the inside! Hey, SHUT UP! OK Napoleon... We're on our way to Zapparty's office. That is if you can make it, under all that extra weight you're carrying. Who da' hell are you?! I ain't Gandalph, that's for sure! No! I'm Gandalph! So enjoy the party! Come on. You can't do this to me, I'm runnin' a table here! Tell ya what, we're walking right outta... Take yer hands off me! *Grrr* Aren't you a little old, to be following the bouncing ball? -Chico will kill you for this. -I'm sure he will. Move! Who the? -What the hell?! -I don't know who this... guy is Mr. Zapparty. But he come in downstairs and started-- He's a Seamus I pay-rolled once... What's on your mind Marlowe? Well Parisi... You look better than your mugshots. What'd they... do to you in San Q? Make you play happy family? You got something to say Marlowe... You say it to me! OK, I'll say it to you. There's a guy downstairs. Name of Dial. Your "Brave New Wheel" just took him for 5 Gs! What are you talking about?! Hey wha'da'ya? Get away from me! *Rips* *Roulette Cheaters Device Revealed* Now what does this one do Parisi? Light up his teeth? I don't shake down that easy! Ah, cut the crap Chico! I got enough on you, to change the colour of your suit, ...for 10 years. So you listen, and listen good. Thomas Edison here, is gonna go downstairs and pay-out Dial. And you and me are gonna have a little talk Tell em! Do it Louis. Mr. Zapparty, there's a lota' people down there! I pay out this "Dial" and everybody's wanna get paid off. Shut up! And do it! *Silent Alarmed* You just made a big mistake, my friend. And you made a bigger one. This place is down for the swamp Chico. You goin' under glass! For what? Spinning a wheel? *Heh!* The cops don't move on me Marlowe! I got friends, on top of the mountain! Yeah, what are they gonna do when the rap's homicide? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Didn't he tell ya? Your little house guest here, says he's running a contract on me. Pictures to have me rubbed out! You're... Crazy. Parisi, you still have all the personality of a paper cup. I hear 1 more word about me coppin' a heel. I'ma crumple you up and throw you away! I'll see you, on the front page amigo! *Cheaters Device Thud* -Hey! -Shut up! Come on, snap it up boys! He's waitin' on ya! Parisi had surprised me... It was 10 years since I had made the arrest But he looked 30 years older. Maybe this was the lil' saps last throw. And maybe Chico was loading the dice for em I thought of going back in to check on Annie. But I had this George Dial figured for a guy, if you're not talking about him. He's not listening. Then I knew I shoulda gone back in. Freeze! Right there! Don't even breathe. Gum-Heel! Don't even breathe... Now get in the car. Reeeeal slow. He's clean. Let's go! There was a faint smell of almonds in the car. Like marzipan on a birthday cake. At first, I couldn't figure out what it was Then I remembered. We weren't going to any birthday party. We hit the Blvd. head'n West. For some reason, half the LAPD chose that moment to head East! I savioured the irony. We went on through Brentwood, and out into the hills. It was a hell'uva trip. Then the guys in front started having an argument, but I... Couldn't hear what they were sayin'. (Ankle Holster) We were bouncing over rough ground, when the chauffeur... Leaned over and began to pull at somethin'. Then I could really smell it. That sweet smell of almonds. *Cough* Cyanide! The gas they use to execute killers in Nevada. *Wheezing* *Tuck And Roll!* The license plate was a privileged number. California 5-A-6. *Clang* The owner was easy to find. Wilcox Ave. had a brand new file on em... His body had just washed up on the Santa Monica beach, presumed drowned. His name: Hugo Candless. -Course they ain't opened em up yet - *Hack* *Cough* But uh. the Doc. fixed the time more or less. What did he put on the card? *Gasp* Between 12 noon and 1:00. Blood separation didn't start till 3 anyhow You don't think he drowned, huh? *Clears Throat* Not enough water in the lungs. You wanna know what I think? *Soft Cough* Zyklon B... Or Cyanide. Once seen, never forgotten. Phil. *Blows Nose* *Sniff* *Phew* *Ugh* Thanks Charlie. *Erhem* You got time for some breakfast? No... I knew that name "Candless" from somewhere but... Nevada gas doesn't improve the concentration... And I couldn't remember where. By the time I had dragged myself over to Annie's house, the sun was comin' up. If the birds were singin', I didn't hear em OK, let me guess... You left the club, without even saying goodnight. So you came all the way here to apologize. Then on the way, you stopped off at, Musso and Frank's, for a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. And... Lost track of time... Ca-- *Ahem* Can I use your phone? You don't look good. What'd you have with your OJ? *Heh* Marzipan! And borrow your car? How'd you get here? Passing truck. Ya got a cup of coffee? Mmm-Hmm. *Sigh* Oh boy! Hugo Candless had lived pretty high. Even for this town. A man like that collects enemies. It goes with the territory. His house was the kind of place, that the Chico Zappartys of this world copied. Brick by brick. ... And still get wrong. *Ehm* *Nice Bell* Marlowe! :) What can I do for you? Well ya can... Thank me for the 5 Gs. Invite me in. I'm here to see Mrs. Candless Oh, she's um... She's at the morgue. There's been a terrible accident. Her husband drowned last night. I know. That's why I'm here, I need to ask her some... Questions. Well, you're welcome to wait. But uh... I doubt if she'll see you. She's in a pretty bad way right now. You uh... Friend of the family? Junior partner... Candless and Winetrout. Ah! *Tsk* Condolence calls... They haven't stopped all morning... Listen, Why don't you give me a call at the office tomorrow. And uh, maybe we can fix up an appt. ? Uh... The downtown number. I'll be there anytime after say uh, 8:30. Please excuse me. Go ahead. Talk to you tomorrow? I wanted to know, a whole lot more about Hugo Candless. Like who his enemies were... Like how the killers got their hand's on his limousine. They'da needed time, to turn it into a gas chamber. But that's one question I didn't have to ask. Because the answer was coming up the driveway. I could've walked right over, and introduced myself. But the look on that widow's face. Told me I'd be wasting my time. Mrs. Candless was not receiving visitors. Not today. I didn't think a couple of quarters would go too far with the chauffeur either. *Woof Woof Woof!* But at least he wasn't one'a the guys who tried to gas me. That was somethin'... I needed to talk to Violets Magee. Just who in the hell do you think you are Marlowe?! What? I tell you to walk away from Parisi, and what do you do?! You foul up one of the BEST operations we ever planned! You call the station house... In the middle of the night to report a double slaying. And then vanish... In case you didn't know, that's an offense! I can explain all that... What'da mean, I fouled up an operation? Parisi, you meat-head! Parisi and Zapparty! What are you talkin' about?! I'm talking about illicit gambling, at the club Egypt! We staked the joint out. We put in an undercover man. Then just as the fun begins... This 2-Bit, Seamus. Name of Marlowe... Waltz' into Zapparty's office, and blows the whole thing... SKY HIGH! Undercover man? It's a name we use. When we plant a guy on the inside. Just before we bust a joint. Remember?!! Gandalph?! Gandalph!! What happened? 5 mins before we sent in the cavalry... Parisi lams out the back with Zapparty. And high-tails it to the boarder. Why?! Good question. Because someone made them nervous! Just in time! You got the picture?! What about all this? You mean you can't work this out? The 2 mugs that jumped you, were from Reno. Parisi country. A hot-shot lawyer called Hugo Candless Died last night. Because he threw away Parisi's case 10 years ago! And if there was any justice... You, would be up there with him, strumming a harp. Candless was Parisi's defense lawyer, wasn't he? Brilliant! Only he didn't do much defendin' He took the money, and let the case slide. Parisi had a hit list. Candless was top, YOU were second. The D.A. was 3rd. And I warned all 3 of ya! But who listens to Magee?! WHO LISTENS TO MAGEE?!!! Nobody listens to Magee. "Parisi couldn't kill time" ... What happens now? What the hell do you think happens now? I file the report. And I wouldn't count on getting your investigator's license renewed. Not in this town. If jail can break a man outta giving 6-4. Parisi fitted the frame. They don't parole ya, on compassionate grounds, if you're liable to start a war and then run off like... Jesse Owens. But that's exactly what Parisi had done. With Zapparty right behind him. *Honey I'm Home!* On the way back to Annie's house, I couldn't stop seeing Candless. That twisted face on the slab... I thought about his iceberg widow... and the pros from Reno, About Zapparty, and George Dial and... Suddenly there it was. How's the hangover? I was lookin' right at it! "Annie, you look like you could use a drink too" Why thank you Philip, I'd like a small gin with a twist of lemon. "Of course my dear, crushed ice or cubed?" Now who shall we drink to? The Astors, the Cabots or both? *Liquor Smack* Annie. How'd you come to meet George Dial? At a very boring party. He was the only one there without 4 hands. And then came expensive restaurants, flowers and full treatment. Huh? I think I'd better tell ya Philip. Some girls enjoy things like that. And just occasionally the conversation, likened it's shift to the... Thoughts of P. Marlowe... Why not? *Ice Clink* You're a fascinating, captivating man. With a great future behind you... So after a while he had a pretty good idea, where I eat, where I garage my car. And things like that... Is it a secret? Yesterday a man named, Candless... Disappeared at lunchtime. His body washed-up on the beach at midnight *More booze* George Dial was... With you, every minute of that time. Wasn't he? Except when I was changing. It destroys the magik. OK, Philip. What is it? *Tsk* You're not gonna like it! You've been used. Used? How? First, to set me up. Then as an alibi... You're not serious?! Murder is! Has somebody been scrambling your brains? We don't operate that way. The report's closed... And the answer is NO! I don't care who ya been talkin' to! You can go talk to the pope's tomcat! The answer is N-O. NO! *PHEW* What did he say? He said "Yes." I wonder what this is. In case I have to tell the Dr. -When's Dial expecting you? - 8:30. Wouldn't it be terrible if Norma Shearer, had a dress exactly like mine? Yeah, but you're not goin'. I know. Imagine their faces. Open your purse. -But I just paid. -For this... Philip... I don't think I can use it. Nobody can. It's empty! But it still scares people. Now when we get there... I want you to let me out and drive around the block a couple times. Excuse me! Do you have a doggy-bag for this? Annie, we have to go! And the pickle, he adores pickle! Do you have a dog? You look like you should have a dog. They make wonderful companions... If you can stand the stains on the carpet, and the other lil things in the corners. I highly recommend any lonely, downcast... person to throw caution to the wind! Annie! Get a dog. I'm ready. Philip! She's at home, I saw her through the window Now whatever happens... -Just keep talking. -*Sigh* I'll do my best. Take care of yourself. *Nice Bell* Oh, good-evening. My name is Anne Riordan, I'm a friend of Mr. Dial's. Would you please tell Mrs. Candless I'm here? Oh! What a beautiful hallway! (Inaudible) But do keep out the night air. It's very bad for bronchial condition. Do you have a bronchial condition? No'sum. Is Mrs. Candless expecting you? I won't have a drink thank you. But you will get my name right, won't you? -But I-- -Riordan. Anne Riordan. Yes'sum. *Phew* *Dog Barking* I'm Mrs. Candless. I don't think we've met. -Miss uhh.. -I know and I... Hate to barge in on you like this. But I've got to talk to you. About George. You're a friend of Mr. Dial's? Oh, friendship can take so many meanings. Can't it? And you know what they say about Hollywood. It's no place for a girl to find a boyfriend. Especially her own. I don't understand. Try. George said what?! That your husband carried more insurance than The Prudential. And that made-up for everything. Listen uh, little miss whatever your name is. I don't know what game you're playing, but I'm calling "Time." Please leave. Now! There's something going on out there! There's more going on in here. It could be a murder investigation. What did you say? *Lock Picks* Jezebel! Jezebel! Call the police. Don't move Mrs. Candless. This thing's kind of unstable. Jezebel, call the police. -Yes'sum. -No'sum! Sit down Jezebel. Why don't you pour us all a drink Mrs. Candless... And we'll while away a happy hour. Discussing the dear departed, and how much you miss him. Now that only his money is left. Who are you?! The other woman. Annie had given me Dial's address. He already lived well. On Candless money, he could live a whole lot better. For me the place was perfect. One of those buildings where they have a service elevator to the garage. And only one guy on the desk Can I help you? Yeah, maybe you can. I'm lookin' for George Dial. Mr. Dial... Apt. 4-1-3, Fourth floor. Thanks pal. Hey! What's your name? I'm supposed to announce you. Now-no-no-no wait! *Ehm* Listen... See I'm an old friend of his, from his railroad days. And I wanna surprise him. OK? Still supposed to announce people... That's what I get paid for. Yeah, sure it is. Uh... Well, you wouldn't happen to have change for a $5, would you? No, No change at all. Didn't think so. I never knew Mr. Dial ever worked on the railroad?! Don't worry! Got'cha covered! *Puts Out Cigarette On Floor* *Door Buzzer* -What the hell are you doing?! -Get on up! Before I rearrange your face! All I need is an excuse Dial! OK... Ok whatever it is... We can work it out right? Yeah, sure we can. Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone and call your lady love. *Laughs* Oh I get it! Uh, listen. You've got his all wrong! Annie means absolutely nothing to me! Annie? I didn't say anything about Annie. I said yer lady love. Her name is Esther. Mrs. Esther Candless. Your boss' wife? You remember your boss. The one who got drowned on Parisi's orders. Only it wasn't Parisi, and he didn't drown. Pick up the phone. If you think, I'm gonna say anything to Esther. Get the number! *Rotary Spins* Hello? I'll call him. How long will it take you? 30 minutes. And tell em to bring Harry with em. Casanova and I, are on our way. Sure I will... See you soon. Back off! Slowly... Keep your hands where I can see them at all times. How you gonna blame this one on Parisi? All I have to do is make one phone call. -Marlowe! -Who to? Your hitmen are in wooden boxes. *Laughs* "Hitmen" ... I'm calling the police! You remember the police? They're the people who send you to jail. For breaking into other people's apts. I like your style... Unfortunately it's mine! Take some air! This place is a house of class. No class. Marlowe... You got it wrong! I never used Annie as an alibi. Wh-why should I do that? Hmm? And I had nothing to do with any attempt on your life or on Hugo's... What's wrong Dial? Didn't ya ever take a ride in your boss' car before? Take a closer look! Real luxury huh? Fully customized! Front and back! Listen, I don't know what this is about. But surely we can talk! -Yeah sure we can! On the inside! -NO! Wha?! Marlowe! I rolled the big car West, on Sunset, and out through Brentwood. Dial knew where we were headed alright. The further West we drove, the more money he offered. Marlowe I haven't done anything wrong. I mean Annie... I almost got to feeling sorry for em back there. Are you listening to me?! Then I remembered the way Candless looked in the morgue. And I put my foot down harder. Marlowe listen. Listen! You've got to listen to me! I haven't done anything wrong! Marlowe?! Let me outta here! Marlowe, listen to me! Marlowe! Please, just-just I'll give you money! *Big* *Yawn* *Violets Rattle* Try a violet, they're good for the breath. Try another. Loosen your gun a lot. And stop lookin' like a cop! Where in the hell did ya get this? Stray dog loaned it to me. Annie told you who's in the back? Oh please I got it comin' outta my ear's huh? Where's the proof? It's up to you. I told em you were a hood who likes gassing people. Can he sing me a song? You ask him right. He'll sing ya an opera. He looks like some movie star! You didn't tell me, he looked like some movie star! Harry take a look! Harry agrees! OK Mr. movie star... Come on out! We're gonna give you a screen test! You ever take a test before?! So this is how we do it. I ask a question, and you answer it! Huh? And no broom, OK? Now how much did Mrs. Candless pay my friends from Reno to "cool off" the old man?! 2 Grand?! 3 Grand?! How much?! How much?! How much?!!! -What?! -Two! And then you paid em, to gas my buddy here right?! Make it look like "Mops" Poor little "Mops" ! Was killin' everybody he didn't like. Right?! Yes! Now that was stupid! Everybody knows, Parisi couldn't kill time! He passed the test. Back to the studio! Go left! Left! *Heh-heh* How'd you like that?! Avoiding publicity huh? He's worse than Garbo is. Ha! -Which one is the salad fork? -Salad fork is the small one. Good afternoon Miss Riordan, how are you? I have a call for uh, your table. Thank you! No trouble at all Miss Riordan! It's a pleasure to see you again. Enjoy your luncheon. I don't know how you do it. I mean... I don't even know how we even got into this place. They never forget a face. Hello? It's for you! Marlowe. Oh hello, Violets. what?! It's down here on the expenses. In black and white. P. Marlowe. One large scotch whiskey... Gandalph account. I can't authorize that! Well I'm comin' over there, to talk to you about it. Who told him I was here? Can you trust your hairdresser? -You're Mr. Marlowe? -That's what it says on the door. You have to help me. Next on Philip Marlowe, Private Eye! That man's been dead for hours... What's the game? Tinsel town's latest, clean cut, heart throb. Takes a powder. That kills him!

Powers Boothe probes the Smart Aleck Kill! On the next episode of Philip Marlowe, Private Eye!
