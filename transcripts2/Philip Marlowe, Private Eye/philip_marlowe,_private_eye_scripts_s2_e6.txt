 Every booze party ends in a fight... Old scores are settled. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife... And study their husband's necks. *Pours Glass of Rye* *Wind Rustling* It was a night when you didn't know your friends... But strangers look familiar. A night like this... the smartest thing to do, is nothin'... Stay home. *Wind Rustling* It was like the wind, carried people along with it. Made them feel they had to keep moving. Lookin' for a place to rest...

 Or a stranger to spend time with. *Oh!* S'cuse me. Another face I knew from somewhere. The Roadster... It's parked around the corner Mr. Barsley. Well maybe it's just a coincidence. Maybe. There he is now! Shall I go after him Mr. Barsley? No, not yet Leon. Toms, you give a guy a full measure of beer for his money. Must be this hot weather makin' me forget. Won't happen again. -*Ahhh* -*He-He* -Gimmie a beer. *Chair Wood Creak* *Radio In Background* I don't like drunks in the first place... And in the second place, I don't like em gettin' drunk in here... And in the third place, I don't like em in the first place. Warner Brothers could use that. They did! *He-he* Hey! You'd think on a hot night like this, I'd have couple more customers... Yeah well, maybe it's the wind.... *Wind Howls* I hope it's only the wind. *Crowd Cheering on Radio* Thanks. *Radio Chatter* What'll ya have Mister? Beer, if it's cold. It's cold. *Sigh* *Hmph* Ugh, warm. Nothing's going right today. *Lighter Click* Seen a woman? White dress, real knock-out? *Tsk* Narrow jacket. Big white hat. Drives the red Roadster outside. Wearing sandalwood? Yeah, usually... How'd you know? Woman like that, on a night like this... She'd be wearing sandalwood. You haven't seen her? Wish I had. Me too. What about you Mac? *Sniffing Something* What's the matter, you can't talk maybe? What's sandalwood smell like? Trouble. *More Sniffing* *Snaps Shut* Sure, I can talk. But I can say "Goodbye Waldo." *Gun Jammed* Call the cops! Man: Hey! That guy stole my car! What am I gonna do now?! I mean, he's dead! *Panting* Look at that blood! I'm gonna lose this place! I borrowed $600 from my father. People will be curious. You mean, this could be good for business? There's nothin' like a murder, to give a bar a little character. Cop: Alright folks just stand back. Stand back, thank you. *Bell rings* Hey, let's have a look... Eyy, you been reading too many Dick Tracy comic books. Ain't this tamale somethin' ?! *Police Chatter* See this? Instead'a lookin' for fingerprints, take a look at this Benzedrine inhaler. The killer was obviously some drug-crazed hop head. But why didn't he dust the bartender and that goofy P.I. ? His gun jammed. Come 'ere. Come here. You know Lindy was absolutely right... Those guys, got a lot of things figured out. Eyy! Buy yourself a taco, Tamale... Come down here. *Sigh* He lives in your Apt. complex... What an interesting coincidence. Fascinating. I'll tell you what's fascinating... You always seem to turn-up around corpses. Did you happen to see the kind of gun the perp. used? "Perpetrator" *Chuckle* See what they teach these spics at dick school? It was a snub-nosed .38 *Thanks* See that glass over there? The one that the uhh... The perpetrator was drinkin' from. Why don't you go over there and dust it, Lt. Yberra. The killer deliberately smudged that glass when he set it down. So observant. Dust it anyway. The uh, owner of this dive... recalls the deceased talkin' about a lady. I don't think the term "lady" was used. Oh-ho! You've got no respect for anyone. Have you Marlowe? *Snack Crack* Tell me about the woman Coates was lookin' for. This your first killing of the night Lt. ? The woman, Marlowe. Tell me about the woman. No idea. Alright, you keep your eyes peeled for that Roadster... And when you see it, you give me a call. Happy to Lieutenant. I was wondering why someone would call Joseph Coates, "Waldo" ? And I was wondering the same thing myself, Lt. Yberra. I didn't know the guy very well... But uhm, I would think that maybe he had somethin' to hide. You know a lot more than you let on pal. Walkin' around, acting real stupid... After some innocent citizen gets dusted. Oh, you knew Coates, or Waldo or whatever he called himself? No. Just said he was "innocent." I knew Copernik... He was a crooked as they come. I wondered what his angle was this time. *Bulb Clicks* Drive tamale. I don't think you call too many Mexicans "tamale." *Hmph* Why not? Because... I don't see any knife scars on your neck. Oh, you-you telling me that uhh... Somebody's gonna cut my throat for speaking Spanish, amigo? Because I work with you... Doesn't make us "amigos." ... Lt. Yeah, you got a lot to learn. Well, well well! Don't be leavin' town Marlowe! And don't be firing at innocent citizen's cars. Drive tamale. *Stuffs Face* There it was... Driftin' by, like something out of a dream ...The car they were all lookin' for... An expensive car, for an expensive lady... The lady Waldo had been asking about just before he got taken down... Got the idea I'd better find her before anyone else did. I wasn't surprised to find the Roadster... Parked around the back of my building... Or to find that the lady had vanished again... I didn't really believe in her anyway. *Wind Howls* Lola Barsley... That made her real enough... Maybe too real. Frank Barsley was a politician... The man of the people. He was calling himself these days. He was hopin' that people would buy that at next months vote. Word on the street had it, he wasn't leaving anything to chance. They said Lola Barsley's husband got what he wanted... One way or another. I figured Mrs. Barsley would show up... Somebody had to tell her, the guy she was looking for wouldn't be home. Tonight, or any other night. *Lock Rattles* *Metal Breaks* What are you doing Mrs. Barsley? Who are you? Philip Marlowe. And how do you know my name? That's a reasonable question... I checked the registration in your Roadster *Wind Rustles* What are you doing here Lola? I'm visiting my Mother. The file usually works when I forget my key Well if that's the case, I got some really bad news. Your Mother's name is Waldo... Unless she calls herself Joseph Coates, and she's dead. You in trouble? The police are lookin' for you. Come on. It's okay. I live one floor down. v *Swills Booze* *Gasp of Relief* I needed that! I guess the cat's out of the bag. Mother isn't really called Waldo. *Squeak* *Wind Howls, Railcar Passes* Tell me about him. Our ex-chauffeur... (0uR EggZ s0 F1Rm) I didn't like him, but I'm sorry he's dead. Murdered Mrs. Barsley... A man like Waldo was born to be murdered. I take it, you won't be wearing black to the funeral. This is quite a chess set! *Lays Piece* You play? I haven't in a long while... But I'm game. Lola Barsley was up to her beautiful eyes in somethin'... I needed to know what it was... I was ready to bet the cops were the least of her troubles... There was no time for anything fancy... I had to take her by surprise... Shock some answers out of err... It wasn't gonna be easy... *Piece Clicks* Lola was the kind who would think twice before giving you the time of day... Then she'd probably lie about it. Sandalwood. You ever play chess with your ex-chauffeur? Do we have to talk about him? I think so... Check. Mate. Fools mate Lola. Why would somebody walk into a bar, dust him, and call him Waldo? That was probably the nicest thing anyone ever called him. *Wind Vigorously Howling* What're you doing? You'd better not be seen in this. Before Waldo was shot he described you and... This jacket. *Santa ana Blows* And... Your hat. Police know about that too, do they? And will they be looking for a woman in a white dress? Oh yes..... Don't you think it's getting a little hot in here? It's the wind. *Deep Breath* Maybe other parts of the building are cooler. Waldo's Apt. ? That's a suggestion. Don't play me for a chump... Mrs. Barsley what is it you want? Before it's too late... I have to pick up a string of imitation pearls. Waldo borrowed them and... I came to buy them back. -Imitation? -Yes! Sentimental value... You know about sentimental, don't you Mr. Marlowe? Why don't you just call the police? I guess I'd better go talk to them... If that's what you want. *Knock at Door* That could be them. Easy! This weather has got everyone crazy! You know... You could do a lot of damage with that if.. You happen to flick the safety off... *3 Knocks* Be right there! *Sharp Breath* Where's the other player? I sorta' play against myself. Oh-ho we all do... Learnt a lot about that in the pen. Learnt a lot about-- Nothin' in 7 years. Is that where you met Waldo? That's where I didn't meet em... He ratted on me! He thought he could get away by changing his name from Waldo... To Joe Coates. - Did prison make you bitter? - *Scoffs* No... *Chuckling* Just crazy... Yeah... But that's OK too... Only someone a little crazy would watch you leave the bar when the cops finished. Nothing personal but uh, dead witnesses are best. -Gun might jam again. -I'll tell that to the angels! I'd say "look behind you", but you might not believe me. Ah! I owe you Mrs. Barsley! Damn! The price of sentiment keeps going up in this town, huh? How bout a drink? I've got great faith you can be rehabilitated. After they electrocute ya! *Lays Glass* *Picks up Phone* *Rotary Spins* -Voice on line: Hello this is precinct. -Yeah let me talk to Lt. Yberra. Precinct: He's not at his desk right now. OK, well you tell him that uhh... This is Philip Marlowe... I've got his perpetrator, here in my Apt. -Precinct: His perpetrator? Got it... Right -Thanks. *Phone Clunk* D'you know anything about pearls? They come out of oysters. Frank Barsley? Heard em talk on the radio... Sounds like he's got it made. I'd called Yberra... But it was Copernik who showed up to collect the killer... Said: "It was his case, his collar." I had better things to do than argue with him... Like drinkin' some supper... I also made a couple'a other calls... Heard an interesting rumor... Seems Frank Barsley had been spending time ...With a society dame called Eva Kolchenko ...I wondered what his wife thought about that... I told Lola to go on home, grab an early night... She said she would... Neither one of us believed her. I still don't have what I came for Mr. Marlowe. Copernik was back too, stakin' the place out. *Cat Meowing* Old woman: Oh that's a good Leo! Oh! *Kissy Face* That's my big pussy cat! *Wind Howling* Talk pearls to me. I guess I told you a little white lie about them, didn't I? Is that why Waldo's dead? Waldo stole the pearls and demanded $3000 ...For their return. I had nothing to do with his death. The money is yours if you help me get the pearls back! Wouldn't it be simpler and cheaper to have your husband handle this? He seems to be pretty well connected with the police. Look lady it's time you came through with some answers! One man's dead, another tried to kill me and the cops are leaning on me hard! You're right Mr. Marlowe... You see... My husband is a powerful man... Powerful enough to get away with anything! Anything he cares to. Did he give you the pearls? My husband only gives expensive gifts to his mistress. He thinks I bought them at a charity bazaar for $25... They're worth $25 000! Not to mention sentimental value. There was a man... He was a flyer... A man who cared nothing for danger. A bit like you Mr. Marlowe... His name was Stan... We were in love. "Flyer" huh? Where would a flyer get 25 grand to spend on a string of beads? He bought them from a refugee in South America... He gave them to me! As a symbol... Of the promise between us... They were our escape! When the time was right, we were going to sell them and run away together! *Scoff* Of course that time just... Never seemed to come around. Early last month... Stan was flying a cargo across the Mexican border... His engine caught fire! He was killed in the crash. I believe... My husband had him murdered! You're a very beautiful woman Mrs. Barsley ...I can understand why a man would kill for you. I've got to find those pearls! They're all I've got left now... The only part of me my husband doesn't own. *Wind Rustling* Wait a minute! -What's this? -The pearls! I can't, can you open it for me? Sorry Lola... Maybe Waldo had em on him. *Window Blows Open* My God! You know this guy? It's Leon, my husband's campaign manager. Does he know about the pearls? No only Waldo, I'm sure of it! You tell me straight... Do you know anything about this? No Mr. Marlowe. I don't. Okay Mrs. Barsley. *Face Stuffed* -What're you doin' here? -What jou taught me to do. Fighting crime and evil. Describe those pearls to me. White, they had uh... Silver clasp in the shape of a propeller blade with a little diamond in the center. *Whiffs* Smells like burnt rope. Mexican tobacco probably... (Ha!) Waldo smoke cheap cigarettes? No just cigars. Early tonight I saw Leon with one of these cigarettes glued to his lip Do you ever just want to get away? Just take a train or a boat somewhere? Anywhere? D'you ever wish you were born someplace else? I think about it all the time. Now why would Leon have a key to this place? *Blows Match* I think Leon knew his killer. Knew him well enough to let em in anyway. Leon ever been in jail? No. Let's get out of here, please. -Your husband serve time? -No! Let's just go! Cops... They'll take the elevator up. You'd better take the back stairs. -Come with me. -I'll catch up with ya later, come on. *Fly* *Jazz* *Liquor Flows* *Whiffs* *Jazz* *Ahhhhhh!* What are you doin' here? -Waterin' the plants. -Really? How bout breaking and entering? Waldo left me a key... He asked me to, look after his plants if anything should happen to him. Listen... you supposed to water these things every day? Or every other day? I thought you didn't know Waldo very well. Plants bring people together. :) Where's Mrs. Barsley? How should I know? Her husband wouldn't appreciate you spending time with her Marlowe. Yberra you wanna come here? How'd he get there? Damned if I know! There's a lotta' funny things going on here Marlowe. *Clarinet Solo!* First there's Waldo... And then after I picked up Al at your place ...He tried to escape. I had to shoot em. -No... -Sure, It'll be on the news. Now uh, Mr. Barsley's campaigning manager's dead... And well you're here. You knew Leon? Oh, I know a lotta' people in this town! You ever serve time? No but, you will. *Grunts in Pain* I was hired to recover some pearls. These? If you found em on Waldo they're worthless! It was found in his money belt. Now... Who hired ya? You know I can't betray a client's confidence... Easy! You got the makings of a great cop, but not if you cover for him! Tell me something new. Look I need some time... A few hours... -Let me borrow those pearls. -Nah I can't let you have em. You want men like Leon runnin' this town?! Get out of here Marlowe. *Wind Continues to Howl* It didn't take me long to find Leon's car.. Only it wasn't his... It belonged to Frank Barsley's new girlfriend... Eva Kolchenko had.. A pile of dough, and a taste for politics.. She was what they call "A kingmaker." Word on the street was the Frank liked the lady a lot... (See you guys later on) And liked the dough even better. Yes sir? I got a car here that belongs to Miss Eva Kolchenko. Oh, I'll take care of it Benji. Arigato. You have something for me? Oh I don't think so uh... The car must belong to one of your servants It's an... Old green Chevy. *Chuckle* On the contrary! The car is mine. I approve of a solid automobile that is... Utilitarian... For the people. I have a number of cars. You wish perhaps a reward? I wish perhaps to see Frank Barsley. *Scoff* Why?? Because a man who worked for him is dead! How horrible! If I should see Mr. Barsley. I'll tell him that you are looking for him. You can also tell him he made a big mistake tonight. Things are gonna happen that he won't like! You don't play games with people's lives! Frank: Oh, come on now Mr. Marlowe... No one playing any games here... C'mon... Come on in here! Sit down! Thanks for returning the car... Honestly I-I think you may have some of the facts wrong. I was just about to point that out. If you would excuse us for a moment Miss Kolchenko. Please uh, why don't you uh, sit down here. I've been informed about Leon. I just don't know what happened at your Apt. but.. I'm sure the police will find out who is responsible and justice will prevail. I of course will take care... Of Leon's wife... And his 3 children. You have a light? Sure! sure. Hot night, would you like a drink? Uhhh... -Lemonade! -Scotch for me. Scotch. Ahh... You ever notice... How great civilizations... Rise and fall? *Scoff* I have to admit I haven't paid too much attention to those things tonight. Constantinople... Athens... They dominated the world... Crumbling cities now. Before you went into politics, did you teach history? Oh no no. I... I leave that to those who are... Qualified... All I'm saying is that everything has it's time and it's season. Just like the "Good Book" promises... And Los Angeles is next! We are in the right place, at the right time! Mr. Marlowe. There's a new wind Mr. Marlowe. It's a wind of change... Sounds dandy! And whoever controls Los Angeles... Controls the entire planet! Oh! Come on now, you're being a bit of a cynic. *Chuckle* You found me out! *Parry Laugh* Maybe... And I need your help. And Frank Barsley does not forget a kindness. Especially in the midst of a political race! Which means I should forget about Leon? W-w-w, Just-just leave that to the police! You know what you need now is a good night's sleep! And I'm gonna get someone to drive you home You really think you can continue? Absolutely! What purpose would be served by an investigation... That would only harm Leon's family? None-none at all. *Deep Lying Breath* And I know... That you are the last person in the world.. That would do anything... That would harm Lola... It'd be pure folly... For us to continue. Does a mistress come under the category of "folly" ? A mistress is simply uhm... A possession... Like this house. Or my Car... Or my wife! And if anyone interferes with my rights of ownership... Things happen. You're even more charming in person than you are on radio! *Wind STILL Howling* Scrape away the man of the people routine.. And Frank Barsley was about as charming as a rattle snake with a sore head. He hadn't told me a thing! And now I knew who had killed Leon... And why. Maybe I should'a called the cops and went to bed... But there were too many things I didn't know... Lola had told me 2 different stories about her pearls... I needed to know which one was true. Oy! Philip, Philip, Philip... *Lip Smack* You wake me up in the middle of the night for this? You should be ashamed of yourself! A big boy like you... *Sigh* You make me crazy... *Scoff* Ya think they're worth $50? $50? I would sell them for $50 to someone on a dark night... If I didn't like that someone. *Sulfur Fizz* Cheap silver... Cheeeep... A $5 diamond chip. It's not even worth the cleaning! Think maybe... Someone counterfeited those pearls and that clasp recently? Recently? This counterfeit is old... Listen Philip lemme give you a tip... Do me a favour... Stay out of the jewelery business! Stay out. *ha* These have been together... Since Moses was found in the bullrushes. He-he-he! Look! This... Dis is what a real one looks like, take a look. You see? A lady trusted a man... Thought he loved her... Thought she was gettin' a... $25 000 dollar strand of pearls. *Wheezing Laugh/Chuckle* Oy! Ye-ye! *Mmmph* That'll be 6 bits. Hey! Thanks buddy! I had most of it now... Old business was being looked after... The past was being rubbed out... *Persistent Breeze* But I still didn't know what part Lola was playin'... Was she a pawn, or the queen? Was she fightin' to keep her husband or to save her life? Lola? *Rack Slide* *Gasp* Oh my God! I thought you were Frank! *Sobs* *Santa ana Rustle* He hurt you, didn't he? It doesn't matter. *Window Squeaks* I gotta know something... Softly: What? Your husband... Gave me these matches a few hours ago... He also left a booklet of them in Waldo's Apt. What are you talking about? When you're in jail, they only give you a couple of booklets of matches a month. So the cons split them in half like this... Becomes a habit, one that's hard to break.. Why did you tell me Frank never served time? I had to... I didn't mean to lie so much to you... -Every lie I told--- -They're getting me in trouble! It's okay... I guess I understand. *Handbrake Clicking* *Cat or Wind Howling* So... Everyone died! So that Frank could keep his little secret safe. My, we've had a busy night haven't we? The wind would'a kept me awake anyway. You've been in our bedroom. And my wife is beaten up... A husband can be forgiven almost anything.. In a case like that. Why did you kill Leon? You discover he told Waldo about your jail record?! How many others have died for your secret Barsley?! How bout the flyer? Or does his death come under the category of protecting your possessions? Police are coming. Come on, Lt. Copernik... Will understand how distraught I was when I found you here. Does Copernik know about your secret? You might have to kill him, and of course his family. But then... Politics is a dirty business isn't it? Let him go frank! *Oough!* That's the second time you've saved my neck *Dying* Yours now... Take these instead of $3000 Feel like I'm flying... Stan loved the wind... *Mouth Full* You got yourself a murder charge. *Chewing Still* Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. You won't make it stick. As a matter of fact. You're not even going to charge him. Get my meaning? What?! You give me any problems... I'm going straight to internal affairs. I drove down to Malibu... The ocean took the bite outta the hot wind When Waldo quit his job as Frank Barsley's chauffeur... He took 2 things with him... Lola's pearls and Frank's secret... He tried to sell both of them back... But his past caught up with him, before he could collect. With Waldo out of the picture... Frank himself... Took care of the only other guy who knew he had served time for fraud... Leon. And Lola just wanted her pearls back... She never knew they were fake! At least she died believing her fantasy... Not knowing that her brave, handsome flyer Was just another cheap two-timer. Painstakingly Captioned by Chuck Brown. Next Episode, "Pickup on Noon Street"
