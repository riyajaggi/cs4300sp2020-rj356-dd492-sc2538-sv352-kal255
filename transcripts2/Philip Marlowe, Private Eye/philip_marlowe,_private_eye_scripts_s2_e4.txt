 Subtitles By Chuck Brown R.I.P. *Gym Sounds* I'd walked into Benny Cyrano's gym and the Stink of lard and gristle, was like a right hook to the jaw. The main attraction was struttin' his stuff... Good-lookin' boy, as he'd be the first to tell ya... The place was lousy with future champs... If want'n hard enough could make it happen. Just like any gym in town. Then I saw the girl, and she made a difference.

 She just stood there, cool as silk... While the mugs around her beat each other's brains out. *Shoe Squeak* *Match Strike* C'mon let's go, rebound! Get that jab right! *More Chatter* Don't mention it Angel... "St. Leonard Hotel" ? Not bad... Do they still leave mints on the pillow, when they turn down the bed? Chocolates... What's it to you? Hey Jean! See that baby?!

 "Jean" ? Marlowe, Philip Marlowe. Who asked? Do you belong to "The Great White Hope" ? Or can anybody make a bid? I don't belong to anyone Mr. Marlowe. I believe you Angel. Goin' someplace pal? *Sigh* Right through that door. Unless you've got a better idea. Tell me yer name and yer business... Maybe I'll ask Mr. Cyrano, if he wants to see ya... Maybe. Nah... Like my idea better. Here you take this, I don't need it anymore! You asked me to drop by, Mr. Cyrano. Marlowe... You got it. Show me. Goon: Easy! *Gym Chatter* *Knife Snaps Shut* You tough Marlowe? Tough boy?! I get by. That's what they say... The word is: "You get by." About even. So let's talk. Whisky? You know me, Marlowe? Yeah, ya got this place, uh... Night spot, couple'a hotels, and what'll I say... Other interests? "Other interests" That's-that's good. Okay you know me... This is Franklin... You can call him "Frankie." But not "Whitey"... He doesn't like that. It irritates him... And what upsets him, upsets me. *Match Strike* Now I know everybody. Sure. Now let's get down to it... I got a fighter... Hell, I've got a raft of em! But this one's special... Duke Targo... Nice lookin' kid. What'da ya got on em? 12 pro fights, 12 K.O.'s. Number 13 tonight. *Scoff* That could be unlucky! I don't believe in luck, Marlowe... I don't play the odds. I make em! Duke's up against some dumb ox, named of... Deacon Werra, Duke'll destroy em. I won't argue. What's the problem? *Sigh* We've been getting some... Funny calls, Marlowe... Some wiseguy saying that... He thinks Duke might sit this one out. Take a dive. Any pool hall hero, can pick-up a phone and make noises. Yeah, but I'm thinkin' some 2bit punk... Dumb enough to lay threats on me... Could be dumb enough, to try and make em good! What do you want me for? Protection? Muscle I got... I want somebody with brains to find this punk! Close down his game. You find em... I'll close em down. Come on, let's meet the boy. Alright Duke, that's enough! Who's next? That's it. C'mon, I ain't even worked-up a sweat yet?! Save it for tonight. Curly I'll-- Curly's the boss Duke... You do just what he says. Yes sir, Mr. Cyrano. See? This is a nice boy. A light. "A light," I like that. Meet Mr. Marlowe maybe he gonna keep an eye out for you. Nice to meet ya Duke. I've been hearing about some phone calls. You gettin' em too? Some... Don't bother me none. Just some bum calling up making noises. What noises Duke? That I should you know, take a dive. Or what? Or they blow my face away. Stuff like that. What's the story here? I'm Duke's protection! This rube tryin' to take my job?! Go earn your money Shenvair... Don't leave Duke's side... That's what I'm stuck with... All beef and no brains! Here... Ringside! Take a girl. She left town. Take someone else's girl. The whole set-up was screwy... Benny didn't need me to look out for his boy. I should'a turned my back and walked away but... I wanted to know what his game was... Maybe the boxer's girl had an angle I could use. Hey Tony! You still runnin' bets for shorty? Hey, Mr. Marlowe... Didn't I promise my Mama, I was outta that racket? I mean, you got me off that rap. Listen, you got a blonde, good-looker, uh.. Jean somethin'? Sure, Jean Adrian... Room 2-15. Oh! She's swell! Thanks! *Exhale* Hey! Mr. Marlowe... You better watch out! She's Duke Targo's girl. The next light-heavy weight champ! Yeah sure, if they buy it for him. Ahhh! You watch tonight... He'll murder that bum Werra! I wish I was goin'! What's stoppin' ya? Ya broke? Thanks! Skip it. 2-15 you say? Yeah! Thanks Mr. Marlowe!! *Laughing* Heyyy! Where's the fire pal? The girl was okay... But she'd have a headache and a 1/2, when she came out of it. *Smooth Saxophone* Jean's room was a bit like her... It didn't give anything away... It was like she was just passin' through... There were no personal touches... Except... For a couple of old photos. "Ada and Jean... Portland. July, 36." *Jean Groans* *Exhale* *Sigh* Wrap yourself around this, it'll help. *Gasp* You... What the hell are you doin' here? I just came by to return these... See if you were doin' OK... You weren't. Guess I got a dizzy spell. You were slugged Angel, I saw the guy... He tried to run through me on the way outta here. I think ya... Dropped this... Why don't you level with me? I like your whisky Marlowe... But this isn't any of your business. Benny Cyrano's payin' me good dough, and that makes it my business. I'm supposed to be lookin' after your boyfriend. He's not my "boyfriend." Keep talkin' Angel! Do you have to call me "Angel"? Come on... Maybe I can help you, if you're in a jam. *Match Strike!* This guy who comes to the door... Says: He's got a message for Duke... Like a sucker, I open up. He shoves his way in. He was kinda laughin' He says: Tell Duke to be a good boy, or they'll mess me up too. All the time he's pushin' me... Grab my bag, get my gun... Guess he slugged me. *Sax Approach* You won't tell Duke? Not before the fight. How did you 2 love birds meet? *Scoff* Me and my girlfriend, we-we do a... Sisters act, over at Cyrano's night club... Mr. Cyrano brought him backstage one night. Yeah, *Scoff* Benny... Regular fairy godfather! Listen Seamus! Mr. Cyrano's a class guy... And he runs a class joint... I'd still be playin' dives in every tinpot town in this country... If he hadn't given me a break. I like you Angel, loyalty's a nice quality. Your parents? Yeah... So what? They look like nice people. Yeah, sure. We don't get on... They ain't exactly proud, of my profession. I ain't seen em for years. Marlowe? I still like your whisky. I still like you Angel. *Commercial Break* Slim Adams was an old pal... That had most of the low-down... On sport in this city... He was try'n to drag a straight answer outta the new boxing commissioner. I pledge here and now... To the people of this state... That I will do everything in my power... To restore, and enhance... The good name, of the noble art of boxing. Our listeners will sure be happy to hear that... Senator. I hope so Mr. Adams. Senator Foxton quit in an awful hurry, sir? I have no comment on my... Predecessors retirement... My only concern is with the future. Thank you, sir. This is Slim Adams... I've been talking to Sen. John Courtway... Now back to Dean Maxwell, with more on sport. Was that alright? Most informative, sir. Should I put my bundle on Duke Targo, Senator? Excuse me? Fighter. He's up tonight. *Scoffs* I can't help you there... I can find my own way out. What'da ya make of this Sen. Courtway, Slim? Says he's gonna clean up the sport... Who knows? Is he clean? I'm not about to say any politician is clean Marlowe... But I got nothin' that says he's not. Where'd he come from? No place. One'a those guys, always been there. Only you never noticed... That's all there is... Bedtime reading, put you to sleep real fast He got any kids? Nah, never even married. The new boxing commissioner may not have been married... But he sure looked a helluva' lot like... The guy in Jean Adrian's photograph. The guy she said was her father. What's the angle, anything for me? Later Slim, I got tickets for the fights. *Crowd Cheering* *Bulb Flash* How's the lumbago, Mario? Philip! Lousy... (Lumbago: Lower back pain) Listen, you know what's playing at the opera tonight? Traviata. La Traviata, by Verdi... That guy's my god, I have to work. What a life?! Much money changin' hands? Not enough to pass on Traviata. Enough for someone to put a fix in? *Psst* Listen... This Werra, he closes his eyes... Lands a lucky punch and his old mama-mi is gonna be smilin'. That's it. How 'bout Werra's management? They're not smart enough... If they were smart, they wouldn't mess with Benny Cyrano, would they? Break it up! Deacon Werra had bad teeth... and a swing that started in the basement and went nowhere. Duke could take em anytime he wanted... If he wanted. Werra? Targo... I like the kid. *Phew* C'mon Duke! Hey Angel! I put everything I got, onto your boy. Your dough is safe. Looked like Duke was gonna take that dive.. If I was right, he'd do it soon. -Now you're gettin' it. -Army corp is where it's at. 10 Seconds! In 9, 8... 7, 6... Five... 4... THREE TWO ONE ! *Ear Piercing Ring* C'mon moooove! Break it up! I got you, step back! Hold it. - 1.. 2... -Eyy! It's a fix! What'da ya think Angel? 3, 4... Come on! -5, 6... -Boo! Fix! Fix! Fix! Fix the fix! Boo! Fix! It ain't, is it? What's that Tony? It ain't a fix! Not Duke?! Werra's punch had nothin' behind it. But Duke had gone down like an ox... Now he was gettin razzed by the crowd. And he didn't like it one bit! Maybe he's saving. Nah. He just ain't tryin'... He's throwin' it. I don't wanna watch, a whole lot more of this Mr. Marlowe. There's not gonna be a lot more! BOO!!! Jeez, get up! Punk's takin' a dive! 4! Fiiive! SIX! 7...8! -9! -*Crowd Cheers* *Whistling* *Bird Call?* That's it! The ol' one, two! Way to go Duke! Ha! Baby we-- You were right Mr. Marlowe! I should'a listened. How'd you like to meet the winner? Yeah! Follow me down when the crown clears. I'll fix it. The winner! By a K.O. in the 5th round! And still undefeated... DUKE TARGO! Announcer: I can't understand. A couple'a rumba-tumbleâ€™s! Duke had tried his best to lay down and play dead but... But he just couldn't do it... Not in front of his girl. *Clatter* Now he was in real trouble. You seen a sweeter than that jab, in a fight? Sweeter than sugar kid... But what kept you with the right? *All Talking Over Each Other* Hold it! Good to have you on the team, Shenvair. Voice: So I told Duke to go beddy-byes early tonight... Voice: Round Five. Listen, I only had his welfare in mind... I mean he was lookin' awfully tired. I had to figure he wasn't getting his... Beauty sleep, when he needs. Him being so pretty and all. Who the hell?! You tell em, I'm mad. OK? And tell em I don't give up easy! "If at first you don't succeed." If at first?! There was a guy down here. Find this punk for me Marlowe! *Wheel Squeak* *Commercial Break!* So he says: On yer feet punk... Take yer medicine. And I says: ... Keep your heater next to your belly! Come here kid. Duke, this is Tony... Pal O' mine... He figures you're goin' all the way. Oh! Happy to know you Tony! Hey, Duke! Say why don't you come along with us? Were goin' over to Cyrano's. Sure! There's a cabaret in this city... I can recommend to you !!! Peps you up like electricity... When the band is blowing... BLUE!!! They play nothing classic... Or soul down...

So... -You liked the act, huh? -*Nervous chuckle* Yeah. Liked it a lot! (Jean) I want some champagne for these girls! Swell! -I adore bubbly, don't you Philip? -Hey waiter! Sell me a fresh champagne! It'll do in a crisis. *Giggles* What's the matter?! Think you seen me around someplace? No, I never saw you before... If you ladies will excuse me. Little boy's room is over there. I have something for you. *Laughing at you* *Shoe Scuff* *Laughter in Distance* Some guy backstage: Ready! "Adrianna Gianni... Courtway " Adrianna Gianni... Jean Adrian. Milk and honey flow! Everyone is sing-- Jeez! *Sigh of Relief* You scared the life out of me! *Chuckle* I was just uhh... *Clap* Checkin' to see that everything was safe for you girls! *Scoff/Laugh* There was um... Some trouble earlier. Yeah I heard. Nobody'd be dumb enough to try anything in here. Would they? *Poke* Hmmm. - *Giggle* - How many um... How long have you and Jean been together? A year... Little less, why? Oh! *Pppt* She just showed me a picture of the act, only... You weren't in it. That'd be her partner before me... Ada. *Tsk/Sigh* Poor Ada... It's a real tragic story. You know I'm a... Sentimental guy. Why don't you tell me about it? Well, *Tsk* Oh! This business can be awful tough on a girl... If you don't get the breaks... You can go down a long way. You know what I mean? Yeah. Ada? To the bottom of Mississippi River. *Sobs* Not that I ain't felt that way myself. Time to time. But you got your break. *Sigh* Yeah, that's right ain't it?! *Giggles* Just like a fairy tale! Hey that dump we were in, wasn't where you'd expect to find... A talent supporter for this place. Without Whitey... He hit on us right away! Whitey?! Whoops! I ain't supposed to call em that. I've got a message for you Targo... Back again, pal? Come on Shenvair... You're lit-up like the 4th of July! I owe you one! *Shrill Screaming* He's got a gun! -Oh my God! A Gun let's go! -Ahhhhhhh!!!! I shot em... I shot em Marlowe! Yeah, Duke, yeah. I got the guy Mr. Cyrano! Get off! Get off me! *Tsss* Cops never believe anything they get without a struggle. Sit down pal! By the time they got through with us, it was after 3 in the mornin'... I didn't care much... I couldn't stop thinkin' about Tony. I had just wanted to show him a good time and... He winds up stoppin' a bullet. Snap it off! I told ya 50 times! Tell me 50 more. The kid goes down... By this time I got my gun out. Where from? My pocket! Which pocket? THIS POCKET! Turn it out. *Scoff* *Whiff* And you shot em down? Yeah I let em have it! "Ya let em have it" ? Yeah! I was lookin' down the barrel of his gun! Take em downtown. Book em! *Grunts* Get off! Mr Cyrano?! Relax Duke! I'll have you outta there by morning. Well that's it for now... The rest of you clowns can blow... Stay outta trouble. You don't know what trouble is yet! Aww, c'mon Cyrano. Your joint's wall-to-wall stiffs... Call your ritzy friends... I'd love it! I'll have that flatfoot's badge! Cop's gotta have fun too Benny... Just like us regular folk. You're fired Marlowe! I asked you to look out for my boy, and you brought him nothin' but trouble! Get outta here! Both of ya! C'mon Angel... I'll take ya home. You won't get away with it Angel. What do you mean? You pulled the trigger, not Duke. *Scoff* How do you figure that? It was your gun. Maybe I loaned it to him. *Ha-Ha-Ha!* Duke says he pulled the gun out of his pocket. Slowest draw there is... By tomorrow the police lab will know... Dukes handkerchief, didn't share a pocket with a gun. *Rain Falls, Wind Whoosh* *Sigh* Okay, I shot the guy. He was gonna kill Duke. Do ya blame me? Duke grabbed the gun outta my hand and... And slammed into his act. I didn't ask for him to front for me. You let em! He wanted to play the hero... I thought: OK let him have his moment. *Deep Sigh* I knew it had to come out in the end. *Sigh* So where does Shenvair fit in? Shenvair? You know, big clumsy guy... Always gettin' in the way. Decides to pick a fight with me... Just as the hit man makes his move. I don't like the guy... He gives me the creeps. *Lock Turns* You're hidin' somethin' Angel. Look Marlowe, it's late. I don't care what you've done... Or what you think you've done. I wanna help you... But I can't, unless I know. Didn't ya hear Mr. Cyrano? You're off the case. Now let me go, so I can get some sleep. I'm on the case Angel... I'm on the case because a kid I liked died tonight... I'm on the case because of you Angel. Look Marlowe... I like you... Maybe a lot... (?) But I got something I gotta do. I didn't wanna let her go... But she had some plans, that didn't include me. In this business, you get to know when you're standin' in your own way. I couldn't let Jean Adrian, give me the slip that easy.. I had a lotta' questions.... And I figured she had some of the answers. AHHH! - Jean?! - God... No. *Shudder* Marlowe? Shenvair... C'mon, don't look! *Flask Opens* *Booze Swilled* This is gettin' to be a habit. What's the matter with you?! You think I killed him? Nuh-uh... You use a gun, not a straight razor. Don't talk to me like I was a cheap crook! I'm through dancin' with you, I wanna hear some answers!! Why were you meetin' Shenvair here tonight?! He uh... Went into my dressing room and stole some photos. - Of Sen. Courtway? - Yeah. The man you said was your father. That's right! He is! Only he forgot to marry your mother so... You decided to remind him. To shake him down! Yeah, for 100 grand. Why not?! I'm still his kid... He walked out on my mother... Treated her like dirt... Never gave her a nickle. He owed it, Marlowe! Keep talkin' Angel. *Swigs Rye* A while back I... I wrote and asked him for some help... It was the 1st time I ever did anything like that... But me and my partner... Oh, I had a different partner back then. Ada... I heard. We were at rock-bottom... A few bucks, he'd never miss... But he didn't want to admit to nothin'. So you get a new partner... Come into town, you're in some dump... Keep seein' Courtway's mug in the paper... Get mad, and you call em! Yeah! *Gasp-But* When we got booked into Cyrano's... Life seemed a whole lot better... I began to feel lousy about... The whole thing. I didn't want any part of it. Then Shenvair got wise to it. *Cry/Squeak* So he... Said he'd help me blackmail... *Gulp* Courtway, and then we could split the money I didn't wanna do it. Then what? I got scared, that's all. One minute everything was on the up and up ...And then it was all fallin' apart! Shenvair was on me, and on me. And then... *Sniff* That guy came to the hotel and... Duke was real scared about all the... Threats he was gettin'. I got news for you... Nobody was after Duke... The threats were a screen... The bullet that Tony took... Had your name on it Angel. *Shocked Sniff* Your senator plays for keeps. *Horrible Telephone Bell* *It's like a jackhammer!* *Groans* Yeah-yeah... *Sigh* Uh, Hello? It's me Jean Adrian. Look, I told you before... I don't know anyone by that name! Don't hang-up, please. I just wanna tell ya I'm... Leavin' Uh, blowin' town... I don't want anything from you. You're leaving?! Well... That's fine. *Scoff/Sigh* I can understand the way you feel... I... I've given you a hard time. I wish it could've been different. I-I... I mean your my father right? I-I have no daughter. If only I could see you... Umm, make things right. Where are you now? I'm uh, cleaning out my dressing room. I'm at Cyrano's Cyrano's? *Dial Tone* I didn't think you'd come. I was curious. Yeah, you could be a daughter. The eyes, the hair. Don't you remember? I remember. Yeah? You didn't send flowers. But she's... She's dead. So... You can relax. That is not fair. We ended it, when we should have! -A clean break! -Clean?! D'you know how she was livin' in the end?! Do you know how she died?! I don't wanna hear about it! I don't wanna hear anything more about her, or about you! I never should have come here. I told ya to stay in bed Courtway! Mr. Cyrano?! I wanted to see her... I just... Wanted to see her. From now on, you want, what I want... Now, get outta here! Got that senator? That's the voice of the man that owns ya! Voice of power! Drop the gun Benny! *Scoff* That's you Marlowe?! *Chuckle* You don't think you can get outta here do you? You bought yourself your own boxing commissioner... Didn't you Benny? Sweet, sweet deal! Till the Angel here, comes lookin' for child support. *Nervous Chuckle* Whatever you say Marlowe! So you gave her a job... Told Shenvair to keep an eye on her... Only he started playin' both sides against the middle... So you sent Frankie to slice em! Sure Marlowe! Who is this?! I was hired to be the chump senator! When the killer walked in and shot Angel... I was supposed to say he was after Duke Targo! Cause he'd already tried it once after the fight! You're crazy! Marlowe! Gimmie the gun! Are ya dead Frankie?! Frankie!! Game's closed down Benny. I'll take that. Doesn't suit you... Your style is to... Pick-up the phone and get someone else to do your killing. I never told anyone to kill. You took his help?! And you took his money... Money made every rotten way there is! And you let his money tell ya what to do! Even if that meant turning away... While he took down your own daughter!!! That is not true! Adrianna? *Scoff* Only Jean here, she's not her... Your girl called herself Ada, not Jean. And she saved you the trouble! Put herself in the river, a year ago. Oh, no. No! You're not gonna walk away from this one Sen. Courtway. Ada and Jean Adrian... We took our name from hers... Well the act flopped... So we went on a road show, and that flopped too. The going was just a little to tough for Ada. *Tsk* She was so soft, it made me crazy... She kept everything she ever read about her father. She was proud of him. Can you swallow that? Sounds like a nice kid. I kept the photos. Everytime I looked at that guy... And thought of what he could'a done for her, I hated him. *Sigh* Yeah. It wasn't the money you know... I just wanted to mess up his action. Guys like that think they own the world... They think they can get away with anything. Listen... Why don't you stick around? It's not much worse than any other town. *Scoff* You don't wanna waste your time, on a tramp like me Marlowe. (Word) You haven't been around a whole lotta tramps, have you Angel? I'm not playin' for sympathy. I've stripped in too many dressing rooms... And told too many lies, to be anything else Where ya been I've Be-- oh, sorry. I was just leavin'. Don't run too far Angel. See ya round! Cyrano's is closed! Looks like were on the road again. *Tsk* Hell... I couldn't stop thinkin' about Tony... Duke Targo might go all the way but... There'd be one less kid to cheer em on. The boxing commission would have a new chief any day... 4th in a year... He promised to clean up the sport... *Ha-ha* And some mugs might even believe it. I decided to go see Tony's mother. Tell her he was a good kid. Too good to die in a gun fight at Cyrano's. Thanks for reading! Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
