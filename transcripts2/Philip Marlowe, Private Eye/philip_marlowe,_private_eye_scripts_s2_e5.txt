 Subtitles By Chuck Brown :) R.I.P. The very rich aren't the same as you and me ...They're more scared. "We need ya right away!" The lady said... I told her where to find me but... She wasn't fallin' for it... "Come by the house." She said: "If you'd be so kind." The dump was smaller than the White House but... Not by much. Anna Jeeter had said she needed a man...

 By the look of the set-up, she could've rented an army! She could sure afford me. *Gentle Snoring* *4 Knocks on Glass* Come in! There's a Mr. Marlowe to see you ma'am. Come in Mr. Marlowe! I asked him to wait ma'am. It's alright. I'll ring if I need anything. Well Mr. Marlowe... They say: You're a hard man... That you don't walk away from trouble. Trouble is my Business

 Well... I think there's a little cleaning up you'll do very well. *Scoff* I might go that far Mrs. Jeeter. If I knew what we were talkin' about. *Heh!* *3 Weak Chuckles* He thinks you're my wife Anna... Heh-- *Hack* *Cough* Mr. Marlowe... This is Henry Jeeter... My brother. That's enough! 3X Don't fuss... Yeah... Why, he doesn't even look the type! Couldn't you even find a gentleman?! I suggest you try the yacht club... I hear they got some real snappy dressers there! Please?! I came here to talk about a job. Well let's get on with it then! *Clock Dings* *Sigh* There's a girl... Calls herself "Harriet Huntress." Appropriately enough! She works for a big-time gambler... Pulling in rich clientele. She's a shill... Blonde or brunette? She has her hooks... Into Mr. Jeeter's son, Gerald... The last total, he owes the gambler $50 000 Who's the gambler? His name's Estel. Your boy's into Marty Estel, for 50 grand? *Scoff* You have got trouble! *Wheezing Laugh* This crook, frightens you Marlowe? Like I said before... Trouble is my Business But Marty's gonna want somethin'... Guy like that's got his reputation to think of... He can't afford to let some young pup... Run-up a 50G tab, then walk out laughin'! Ahh! Gambling debts aren't legally collectable. We though Gerald would profit from a little scare... But apart from that, we are not interested in... Marty Estel! That vulgar, little panderer! But we are concerned about the girl... ;) Gerald will be very wealthy one day. Everything! Everything I have, goes to him when I'm gone! So how do you wanna play it? That cheap tramp! There must be dirt someplace. Dig for it Marlowe! Dig deep! Sure, that's one way'a goin' about it... It's a bit rough though. Come here, Marlowe... Come closer. You see it, don't you? It clings like a mist to me... Death, Marlowe. I have very little time... So listen very carefully... Never in my life... Have I given in to pressure. And I have no intention of starting now! And I have no intention of leaving a mess!! After me... Now what, is your price? $50 a day, plus expenses. $300 on top, if I pull it off. 50? Your usual fee is... $20. *Chuckling* $40 then... And that's rock-bottom. *Soft Laughter* I bet you didn't lose a nickle in the depression. *Dog Barking* Guess you didn't get around to my heap yet. I suppose I could have the gardener hose it down. *Ouch* Name's... Marlowe. -Philip Marlowe. -George Carter. Sir... This uh... Where a college education gets you these days? I've seen worse. *Drinking on the Job* What kind of a guy is your boss? An open-hearted, generous gentleman. Yeah, he'd give you a dime. If he didn't have a nickle with it. What's the... Dope on young Jeeter? Master Gerald could be described as the... Shy, scholarly type. Early to bed, early to rise. Uh-huh? And old-man jeeter's a friend of widows and orphans... Come on! You can talk to me... I'm on the pay-roll. He's big, blonde... Likes to throw his weight around. Plays a fair game of tennis when he's sober Which isn't often... Thinks he's hell with women. Women in general or... One in particular? It'll probably take em all of a year, to get though the old man's money... Seems a shame... But then, I'm only the help. "Harriet Huntress, P.H. 2 El Milano Apts. N. Sycamore St." A few blocks from the Jeeter place... I noticed I had company... A blind man would'a noticed. Losin' em would'a been easy! Keepin' em with me... That was the challenge. *Engine Backfiring* Get out of there! Grab some sky!! He ain't in there. Come out ya bum! We got ya cornered! Waxnose: Take it easy! *Sigh* Jeez. Frisky: FREEZE?! Gah! *Panting* Your pal's a bit excitable for this line of work. He's just a kid. Got no parents... I let em run around with me. He could hurt somebody! You don't think I'd let em have a loaded gun do ya? *Ugh!* *Clicks* Take em out! Not today... Maybe next time. -I say we blast em! -Hey look, hold on! The hell are you doin'?! Now listen boys... I got a few things to do... Why don't we quit the clownin' and you tell me what it is you want! Sure! You look like a guy that can take a hint... Lay off the Jeeter kid, see? No, I don't see. Leave the Jeeter kid alone. That's the message. Who sent it? Mr. I pack this Luger because I can use it! If you think you can take me... *Scrapes Metal* *Un-Cocks Hammer* You got me cold. *Tony! Shot @ Cyrano's* *Angelo Rizacos* You're lucky this time, ya punk! Aww! *Slap* Shut up! *Hmph* Harriet Huntress might be a tramp, like old Jeeter said but... "Cheap", she wasn't. Smart money stayed here... The uptown crowd... Grand pianos and... Very dry martinis. Good evening, sir. Is Miss Huntress in? Whom shall I announce? Mr. Marty Estel. *Scoff/Sigh* OK, so I tried a fast one, and it didn't get by you... I've got some business with Miss Huntress.. It's umm... Quiet business. $10 is nice money to a working man, with a family sir... But not nice enough for him to risk his job I'm tryin' to give the girl a break... Just tell her I'm from Marty Estel. Take me a month, to earn that... To the people who stay here, it's spare change. Take it pal. Welcome to the human race! It's the front desk Miss Huntress. *6 Knocks* So what's the message, brown eyes? :) Why don't I come inside? I never could talk on my feet. You probably can't talk without a drink in your hand either. *Liquor Pours* This scotch is very nice! *Glass Table* In fact this whole set up, is pretty nice. *Nice Legs ;)* Marty isn't gonna like the way, you used his name to see me. Then why did you let me in? I always look trouble straight in the face. Makes life simpler. *Chuckle* Do I look like trouble? Old-man Jeeter, sent you didn't he, brown eyes? The name's Marlowe... Philip Marlowe. Well Mr. Marlowe. I take it, you have some kind of proposal? *Ahhh* There's no fancy way of sayin' this... How much would you take, to get your claws outta Jr. ? Oh, I'm a bad girl Mr. Marlowe... I don't need money... Men bring it to me... Tied-up with a ribbon. *Lighter Clicks* You seem proud of that. At least I don't make my money, digging around in other people's dirt! I was thinking you might take 500? 500 What? *Heh-he* Not yachts. (?) *Ha-Ha!* *Sharp Inhale* Oh you amuse me! *Laugh/Scoff* I ought'a tell you to, go to hell... But I like brown eyes. So that's the old fool's offer? His idea is you get smeared... But I figure you got somethin' comin'. I've got everything coming! All I have to do is wait! *Scoff* And not so long either, so the story goes.. As soon as the old man bows out... Gerald gets the whole ball game... What he gets, I get. You'd marry em? He could do worse. Maybe you could do better. Oh! Gerald's quite presentable... Even if he does drink too much. *He-hm!* I bet you wouldn't say that to his face. Oh no? Take a look behind you, Mr. Marlowe. Harriet can say anything about me she wants gumshoe. I like it... Now beat it. Before I push your teeth down your throat. Happy to meet you too. You want me to ruin em, babe? I love to see these hard numbers, bend at the knees. Breeding... You can always tell. *Sucker Punch* I think he'll live. *Groan* Don't bet the rent! *Smooth Saxophone* Listen... "The Prez." What? Lester Young... Very fine. I must'a missed somethin'... While I was on vacation. *Sigh* What're you doin' here? Part of the daily routine... The young master dreams up ways, to uh... Blow the old-man's money. I take him there... Then I ferry em home. When he's full of liquor and hard luck stories. *Scoff* That's pretty big of old-man Jeeter. Eh, it's uh... Private arrangement... I have to think of the future. So you got here tonight... And they told ya to drown me in the bathtub. Gerald took a cab to Marty Estel's... Miss Huntress said I should drop you somewhere. That's when Gerald suggested the river. *Psh! Ha-Ha!* Let's get outta here... This place is beginning to... Give me ideas, above my station. *Clink* Gerald's always been partial to the ladies I've never seen em this far over his head before. I could go for Harriet... If she asked me nicely. Waxnose: Hold it!! Frisky: Freeze! Ya bums! Drop the heaters! Get back in the car! You asked for it, punk! Come here, ya dimwit! AHHHHH !! It's the end of the road!-- Nice shootin' pal. He must've taken you for Gerald... Marty Estel's gettin' serious. I figure it was just a scare. But the kid, over-played it. *Tony/Frisky! Angelo Rizacos! Dead Again!* I decided to check a few facts with a colleague... A tub O' lard named: Arbogast... He wasn't much for leg-work, Arbogast... He did alright without it. (Lisbon, Mike and Sovereign) Hold the line please. Philip! My friend, sit... I'll be right with you. My information is... That the wife is onto you. Please! *Munch-munch* I ate already. Looks like you've dropped a couple'a pounds! *Hmm!* I've been cutting down on the hollandaise. Philip! What can I do for you? Or is this a, social call? Harriet Huntress... -She lives at the-- -El Milano! Runs around with uhh. -Gerald Jeeter. -So that's business. Uhm... -Works for Marty Estel. -Works for, Marty Estel. That's business too, as far as she's concerned. That's all I know. You're slippin' pal. Well, she's new in town Philip! I need background. I hear, everything... What's in it? 10? Gah! Call me next month. -20? -Drop by tomorrow! Oh... What do you mean? "Business, as far as she is concerned." ? Estel's nuts about the lady... Everybody knows that! Philip. *Chuckles* *Munch* Marty Estel's club was way out, on the wrong side of the tracks. That didn't stop the sports... From lining up to part with their dough... Marty paid cash when he lost, and he didn't squawk about it... He expected the same from his customers... Sore losers made him mad... And when Marty got mad... Things popped. This is the pal of Miss Huntress... Says he wants to talk to ya. A Seamus huh? Well you can't afford to play here. So I guess you're workin', huh? Yeah. It's a-- About Gerald Jeeter. *Ahhh!* He's into you, for a bundle! So? His family hired me, to get em out of it. He's big and ugly enough to look after himself, ain't he? I'm not too crazy about the guy myself... But if he gets rubbed-out, I don't get paid And I'm already behind on the rent! Rubbed-out? I don't get you Marlowe. The 2 clowns you hired took a shot at Gerald's car today... Only he wasn't there, I was! They weren't too smart! One of em went down. Ehhm, still not with ya. Why would I wanna damage the kid? Maybe you don't want it around town, that he's holdin' out on ya. Listen Marlowe... I play my game on the house percentage... With the crowd I get in here... That's all I need to win. Why would I wanna get tough? Maybe for..... Personal reasons. There's a financial relationship... I ought'a know, I helped set it up. *Tsk* Harriet Huntress has got a cool head for business. I'll give you that. You're talkin' about class Seamus. Somethin' you wouldn't understand! OK... OK, let us assume... For the purposes of this discussion. That I did wanna get rid of the kid. When I tell someone to do a job, he does it right. *Snaps Fingers* Enjoy your drink... It's on the house! Aren't you a little out of your league, brown eyes? Maybe you're following me. *Tsk* Just stopped by, for a word or 2 with your boss. Oh, I'm disappointed... Maybe I'd like you to follow me. *Soft Chuckle* You're throwing it away sweetheart... I haven't got a nickle. Well maybe I've already got a nickle. This jerk bothering you baby? He should'a quit while he was ahead. *Woosh* Â¡Ay, caramba! It's alright Marty! Mr. Marlowe is just leaving. *Roulette Ball Rolls* *07 Black!* Lucky 7! That's you Miss Huntress. I couldn't stop thinkin' about Harriet Huntress... That look she had... The look of a woman, who didn't need luck to get what she wanted. She knew the roulette wheel, would always spin her way. Where ever she went. Tough guys like Marty Estel, would lay down and purr. Money would walk right up, and jump in her pocket! *Dog Barking* Henry, please... You must rest. Leave it to me. I can't-- *Cough* Leave anything to you! You've indulged that boy with... My money! I indulged him?! What have you ever done for this family?!! If you'da had anything to offer... You might at least have married, money. *Hack* No brains! No looks. Hey! I thought I told you to go around the back! Haven't ya heard? I'm practically one'a the family! Oh yeah? And that makes me Carole Lombard. I'll announce you. I'll come too, I don't have time for the whole routine. Oh hey! You can't go up there! I've already seen the old-man in his nightshirt. No wait! Well Mr. Marlowe, you took your own sweet time getting here. I slept an hour or 2... Some nights I do that. I hope... Mr. Jeeter is feeling better. Frankly he thinks the end is near. He won't rest easily until... He knows, that the estate is safe from fortune hunters. He wants to settle with the girl. It won't be easy, she's tough. He's willing to give her $20 000... And a ticket to where ever she wants to go. One-way, I guess? Don't be flippant! That's our last word. Excuse me. Our last word. No negotiations! I'll deliver the message but... I can't guarantee results. Oh, she'll take it... If she has a brain in her head. If she married Gerald, she'd have all this. *Tsk* Ah. Yes. But she'd also have Gerald. I went around the back... And took the freight elevator, up to Harriet's penthouse. The lady wasn't home so... I had to let myself in. I wanted to see her face... Hear her laugh, when I gave her Anna Jeeter's message. She was smart enough to figure it for a desperate bid... And too smart to fall for it. *Liquor Flows* It was still a nice set-up... Real expensive furniture. And scotch so nice, it hurt. There was something... not so nice too. But I couldn't pin it down. I turned up some photos... That didn't do her justice. Young Gerald looked like he was havin' fun. Then it hit me... The smell of cordite. *Hammer Cocks* Harriet Huntress... Very classy lady... Her family's from the top of the social register back East. Very old family money. Oodles of it! Then how come she's a shill, for someone like Marty Estel? They lost every last bean in '29. Her father's from the old-school, didn't survive the wreck. Went down with the ship? Walked outta the board room window... Spread himself thin, all over Wall street. -Family? -Mother's dead. Kid sister, in a snooty, private school. And Harriet sends cheques? Come on Arbogast! You're holding out on me! You uh... Might ask the lady: "what she sees in Gerald Jeeter?" When it was old-man Jeeter, that killed her father. Oh-oh! Nice and legal, of course. The way they do things in that world. Old-man Jeeter might just as well have... Pushed him out the window himself. Thanks Arbogast... Don't get up. *Top's Down :O* *Broken Fire Hydrant* *Waxnose is Dry?* Just take it easy pal! Hands on the wheel! That's a good boy... Enjoy your dinner? I lost my appetite. Oh! What a shame! A man should enjoy his last meal. Look I'm sorry about your buddy. Sure you're sorry! Now you're sorry! He was my kid brother! I didn't kill him. Let's take a drive! Alright... Hold it, right there! I made this silencer myself. The kid helped me. Looks like cast iron. Probably blow your hand off! Not this baby... Packed with steel wool... Good for 3 shots. You got em neat and tidy, I'll say that. You don't listen! I didn't get em at all! I saw the rod in your hand! I didn't use it! Why would I? I thought his gun wasn't loaded! Yeah well ye-- Fooled me with that one. Ya dimwit! Or maybe you enjoyed it?! Some guys are like that. Why did you kill Gerald Jeeter? *Psssh!* Go on... You're kiddin' me! Up in a closet... With a hole in em! Why finger me for it?! You're workin' for Marty Estel, aren't ya? Maybe Marty thought it was time to close his account. I ain't killed nobody! Never even though of it, until my brother was killed! Not by me! Your brother was killed by George Carter, the Jeeter's chauffeur! Well... It's your lucky day Seamus! I gotta go see somebody! A lady! *Hmph* So do I !! That's how you play the game, isn't it? Nothin' left to chance. *Scoff* I don't like surprises... Do you? *Nose Exhale* You are always popping up aren't you? Making noise, getting into trouble. Trouble is my Business What do you want Marlowe? I'm expecting Gerald any minute. I just came by, to drop off your gun. Marty gave it to me... I never carry it... I don't like guns. I found it in your apartment. You weren't home but, Gerald was. Was he still in his pajamas? Yeah... But there was a hole in em! Gerald's dead. He was shot with that gun. You mean it, don't you? In your Apt. with your gun. Poor Gerald! You hated the Jeeters! Wanted revenge for your father! I hated Henry Jeeter. Not Gerald! I wanted to take that old-man, for every last cent! So you went after his son? I don't shoot people, Marlowe! It's not my style! You believe that, don't you? Throw that bum outta here! Hey, where you goin' baby? You wanna keep pulling the high rollers Marty? You're gonna have to show a bit more class! Just... Leavin' pal. Marty seems to think a lot of you. He crowds me... I can't think around him. Where should I go Marlowe? What should I do? Hello George... You're a little early for the action. I've come to collect master Gerald. He's not here. His father passed away this afternoon... Miss Jeeter would like him at home. Have you tried the El Milano? I phoned from the house, no answer. I think we should, pay our respects. I don't wanna go there. You'd rather go home? It's uh, not my place to say so but... Miss Huntress shouldn't expect a rousing welcome back at the house. You're right George. It's not your place to say. Marlowe! I was expecting Gerald. We don't know where he is. He-he doesn't know. I'm sorry about your brother. Thank you. If you can't find Gerald. I've already found em... He was hanging in this lady's closet. How dare you come to this house?! Gerald's dead Miss Jeeter. Gerald?! Dead?! No! Henry's dead! I am sorry Miss Jeeter. You? Killed Gerald?! No. Ask yourself Miss Jeeter... Who'd want Gerald outta the way? Not Harriet here. She already had him signed, sealed and delivered. Well the gangster of course! Marty Estel? That's what somebody wanted me to think... Even down to hiring, 2 comic opera hitmen.. To throw me off the track! I'm gonna call the police! No... Marty's a businessman, first and last. Oh, he could fall for a girl. Fall hard, but... He wouldn't kiss-off the whole ball game, just cause he got mad! And he doesn't rent muscle from Vaudeville. You seem to know a great deal about... The psychology of gangsters, Mr. Marlowe. Ask yourself something else... Who could walk into Harriet's Apt. anytime Without anybody thinkin' twice? A guy with a uniform... A guy with a key. You're fired... Mr. Marlowe... Will you please, get out of this house? Bravo Miss Jeeter, that's quite a performance. You and George hired those 2 clowns, to put me onto Marty... But they weren't too bright... They went into their act... Before anybody knew I was on the job! Anybody but you. Theories, but no proof. One'a the clowns is still around and I think... He'll talk, because George killed his brother! He didn't have to... But I think he enjoyed it! You must've really hated him. You don't know what hate is... All these years... Taking his orders... Years... Taking his insolence! You see... The Jeeters never believed in... Leaving money to women. Every penny!! Was his! I couldn't-- Let him leave it, to that drunken fool! Generations of worth, that... Money is a trust, Mr. Marlowe! Marlowe!!! No!!! George! *Cries of Pain* Go on, laugh! Stupid... Old-woman... Running after a man, half her age. Nobody's laughin'. He didn't love me... As long as the money was coming in. He could pretend... With Gerald out of the way... We could've pretended forever! *Mild Scoff* Cops'll be finished in there, in a minute. Guess this'll all go to the government now. Looks that way... Unless... You've got a different idea... Mrs. Jeeter. They thought he was playing golf, in Palm Springs. And he was signing away the family fortune in JuÃ¡rez... Quiet Mexican wedding. Here's your memories. *Scoff* Gerald never loved me, anymore than I loved him. He just wanted to thumb his nose at his family. And that suited you. Well... We both knew it wouldn't last. It's all yours now. Yes... I'm a wealthy widow. Maybe I could use some protection. Not me, sweetheart... I don't have the clothes. I can buy you clothes. Or the right manners. Oh, I like you better without em! And maybe I... Just don't have the time. Goodbye brown eyes. I'll drop a cheque in your mail... To pay you for your trouble. Don't bother... Trouble is my-- Maybe it would'a lasted a few weeks... Maybe a bit longer. But sooner or later, I would'a said the same goodbye. The lady had turned into one'a the very rich... Like the man said: "They're very different from you and me." _ _ _ Secret Subtitle Says: Hi!
