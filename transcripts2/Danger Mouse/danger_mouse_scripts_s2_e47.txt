 First, the nominees for Best Hero. Danger Moth. Jeopardy Mouse. And Danger Mouse. Good luck, Chief! And the winner is... Danger Mouse! [dramatic music] [crowd cheering] So, would either of you mind if I saved us all? Just do it! [laser whirs] [Danger Mouse whooshes] [Baron screams] Eat this, darling. [Penfold screams] [Penfold thuds] Look out, we're danger rich and safety poor! [dragon roars] [dramatic music] DMs, help us! And the other us! Yes, help both the us-es. [dramatic music] [leg thudding] [dramatic music] [Squawkencluck yelps] [Penfolds scream] [dramatic music] - Thank you. - [audience applauds] Next, the nominees for Best Sidekick are, Penfold! Robo-Penfold! And, well that's odd. Danger Mouse? The winner is, huh, Danger Mouse? [audience gasps] But you're not a sidekick? I get one night of the year when it's about me, and you, you. You're right, Penfold. But we do now have a slight situation to deal with, so why don't you be in charge and I'll be your number two? Really, chief? You're chief now, chief. Well, don't just stand there gawking, GL, get in there like a good sidekick. Sidekick? But I'm not [sighs]. What's the point? He doesn't need me anymore. [rake whacks] [Danger Mouse grunts] [Danger Mouse thuds] Oh, carrots. Thank you very much. [all groaning] The nominees for Best Invention, well there's only one! Professor Squawkencluck! And the winner is. Danger Mouse again? [Squawkencluck gasps] He wasn't even nominated! [Squawkencluck groans] [dramatic music] And the winner is, Penfold? - Danger Mouse! - [crowd cheering] [dramatic music] [Danger Mouse laughs] Hurray! Chief, shouldn't we be begging the professor to come back home? Begging? I've never begged for anything, besides we can invent our own inventions. I mean, how difficult can it be? [dramatic music] Eureka! Behold, Penfold, the dehydrated cactus plant. - Not as good as this! - [heavenly music] Penfold's patented deadly toast launcher! Get a load of this! [dramatic music] [toast pops] [fire whooshes] [alarm wails] [Danger Mouse yelps] Ow! The nominees for Best Boss are, General E. Normus Schwarznut, Colonel K, and, Santa Claus! The winner is, oh come on! This doesn't make sense. Danger Mouse. [bottle rattles] [dramatic music] - Huh? - Look out, Danger... Moth? I suggest a frontal attack while you have the element of surprise. Yeah, it's a bit late for that now! [dramatic music] Now, if you'd used your other foot, you could've taken them both out. Yeah, can you stop interfering? I am doing my job. And I'm explaining how to do it better. Well maybe you do your job better by butting out! [dramatic music] Wait, we're forgetting something. Hmm. This is so exciting! I'm finally taking a ride in the Mark IV. If you don't count out all the times we drove you to jail. Look, I need to stop King Kong Brunel's latest scheme. Just sit back and chill. [Snowman] Chill, yes. I get it because I am... Follow my lead. [dramatic music] Freeze, Brunel! [Snowman thuds] Snowman, what did you do? You said to freeze Brunel. I did what you said. Am I in trouble? Snowman, I love your gadgets. Come on, let's go see everything this new suit of yours can do. Best Driving, Danger Mouse. There's something coming towards us. Looks like a marble. No, more like a ball. A beach ball. A giant beach ball. A massive, huge... It's a planet, you idiot. Brakes, brakes, br-a-a-a-kes! You know, no one ever got hurt saying please. [dramatic music] Please! [ship thuds] [dramatic music] What are you doing? What any hero would do in this situation. Running away? Surrendering to the proper authorities? Escaping, excitingly. Hold tight. [dramatic music] Hmm, handling a bit funny. Because you've never actually driven the Danger Car before. But could an inexperienced driver do this? [dramatic music] [car rattles] [water splashes] Yes. [light music] Best Relaxing, obviously, Danger Mouse. [Danger Mouses munches] [upbeat music] [upbeat music] And Best Hairdo is... Danger Mouse. [dramatic music] ♪ He's the greatest ♪ ♪ He's fantastic ♪ ♪ Wherever [mumbles] danger I'll be ♪ Danger is my middle name. Mullets! Business in the front, party in the back. And now a word from our sponsor. [Danger Mouse gasps] The Supies are brought to you by Danger Flakes. The best cereal with the best spokesman. Me! Danger Flakes, give your colon a treat. [box whooshes] [box booms] [flakes rattle] Of course. Danger Mouse is the spokesman for Danger Flakes and Danger Flakes is sponsoring the Supies! - Hey, gang. - Why so glum? We never win anything. What's the big deal? Nobody cares about the Supies. [somber music] Oh, right, this was your chance to be recognized and I stole the show. Oh, don't worry, I'll fix everything. [dramatic music] The award for Best Phobia goes to Squawk, for her paralyzing fear of clowns. [clowns laughing] Clowns! [screams] [horns honk] [Squawkencluck gasps] No, clowns, no! I give up! But everyone loves a clown. Look at these. [upbeat circus music] [phone shatters] She really doesn't like clowns. The award for Best Nicknames goes to Colonel K! [crowd cheering] Ah, Pinhead!
