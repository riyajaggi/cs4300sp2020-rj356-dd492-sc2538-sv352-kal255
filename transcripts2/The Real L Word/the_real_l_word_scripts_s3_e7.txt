 Previously on The Real L Word... So I was talking to my ex, and we're gonna see if we can make it work and not see other people. I'm super conflicted about moving back to New York, Before I moved to L.A., I had a girlfriend that I loved and I still love. I would hope, like, if you're gonna move back that you would give me, like, advance notice, so I could, like, find another roommate and stuff. Woof.

 I think that people think bisexuals are slutty. It's not like that, it's a confusing place to be. I always considered myself, a lesbian. But now, I guess that I have to say that I would be, bisexual. Kelsey, I love Jay. We're not supposed to be together... And I'm the one who ended it, you know what I mean? It's hard being with somebody who's bisexual. I mean, if the girl wants dick, that's not something I can give her. Do you guys want to try again or what? Is that a weird question? - We're going to. - We want to still be parents. We are parents, but we're going to try again. Seeing how long it took last time, like, it's just... We fight all the time, we are not compatible.

 You know, she's used to us fighting and then getting back together and making up, and I know in my heart that it's not gonna happen this time and that it's over for good. This is not fucking good for me. I cannot deny what I'm feeling, and I can't deny my chemistry with Lauren. I'm not. It's already done. I think this might be a little more than just Dinah fun. I feel like there's something there. I can just tell that you're a dick. I don't know, she seems a little sketchy, and apparently I've already had an argument with her. I mean, no, I'm not sold on her. I'm not going to cave in to you being a dick. What is that? I'm engaged. You're not even excited. It's not necessarily what you envision in your head your parents' reaction being. synced and corrected by chamallow www.addic7ed.com Have a good day. Sara and I are headed back east to see my mom and my grandma. I'm not gonna lie, when I told my mom initially that we were engaged, her reaction was a little lackluster. I know my mom supports us being together and getting married, but I think it will take me actually being in front of her to really get that, you know, excitement and support really kicked in. But I've actually never had a conversation with my grandmother about my sexuality. And now not only do I need to bring it up to her, but, surprise, I'm also getting married, and it's to a woman, and she's right there. I'm a little nervous about this grandma talk. Okay. All right. What do I do? It's either you pay. - How much do I... - $90. - $90? Babe. - What? We got to take five pounds out. I'll tell you what weighs all that is the freaking makeup. It needs to go in there. It's, like, toiletries and all that stuff is in there. It's not makeup. It's toiletries. Toiletries. Take that vest out and wear it. - Put this on? - Put it on, just do it. Take the shoes out. Baby, I'll tell you right now. Can you just take the shoes out? 'Cause they' re easy to take out. I don't think that these shoes weigh... Just take them out. I hate the way you're talking to me right now. Can you do something with them or do you want me to just wear them all? I'll carry them. Sharing the news with our families about, you know, us getting married has been really stressful, and it's kind of taking a toll on our harmony. You look super stylin'. - You too. - From earlier in the morning. Thank you. Bye. Which way do we go? Okay. Great. Thanks. Kiyomi went home a couple of days ago, and I already miss her a lot. I've never had any sort of long-distance situation with anyone, so this is really difficult for me, especially when I have intense feelings. You okay? Um, yeah, I'm bummed. It's just a little... I don't know, it's a lot of... we just spent so much time together. Like, in the past, like, week, you know? With her being in another city too, it's, like, especially not fun for me right now. Yeah, I know. Hi, my love. Good. Uh-oh. Oh, my gosh. So what's going on with you and Lauren? I feel like everything is happening really quick, and I'm, like, trying to take things slow. You know, we're both really busy people with our careers and stuff, and we're just gonna try, and we'll see each other on weekends and see how it goes, you know. I think that it is a little too soon to say that Lauren and I are gonna be serious. I just got out of this relationship with Ali, and I feel like I need to be a little more cautious and not rush into things. I don't know. I feel like... I feel like I have to, like, have some "me time" too. Maybe it'll be better 'cause it's not, like, typical lesbian shit where you hang out every fucking day. But, at the same time, it's nice to like someone. I haven't liked anyone in a really long time. - You know? - Yeah. So, at Dinah Shore she told me something. - What? - She said something along the lines of "I can see myself just being with her." She must have been loaded. I'm joking. It seems like she really digs you. And it's, like, crazy to talk about it right now, you know. We only just met. Yeah, but you're, like, talking about it constantly to the point where I want to, like, gouge my eyes out with a fork. I've never seen you this way, ever. So it freaks me out. But, at the end of the day, all I want is, like, for you to be happy. But if she does anything and dicks you over, like, yeah, I'll hire a hit man. What do you think is gonna happen? Wouldn't that be so funny if you were like, "by the way, I'm moving to New York now." Don't even talk. That is not okay. Psycho. Hey, Kacy. Hello, mama. How are you doing, sweetie? Oh, it's so good to see you. - It's good to see you too. - I love you. I love you too, Julee. So, what's up, Kacy girl? How was the drive? The drive sucked, as it always does. You should live closer. - You should move closer to me. - Hell, no. Now that my mom's retired, she is so much more of, like, a carefree, free-spirited person. She enjoys golf. She enjoys lunch with her daughters. She drives from Riverside all the way out to Los Angeles to see us, and I cherish every moment that I get with my mom. She's always a source of great comfort for me. How's Cori doing? She's doing okay. - Is she? Back to work? - Mm-hmm. I don't know. Sometimes I think she's doing better than I am. Why? Why is that? I think everybody expects to be really gentle with her, and they think I'm fine. And they think you're the tough one. - Well, that's so crappy. - It is pretty crappy. But, you know what, you have to tell people, "hey, I'm hurting." I think a lot of people have this expectation that I'm supposed to forget her. No. Or that I'm supposed to be over it by now. I told you what... that someone at work told me. "I'm sure you're over it by now, but I'm so sorry." Thanks, thanks for that. How many times you went... you did this, four times? Yeah, but I never had to do what Cori did. I never had to deliver the baby. That's... that's hard. I mean, my heart was breaking for both of you that night. My parents had a really difficult time getting pregnant with my sister. It took them ten years and, like, four miscarriages, but they managed to get pregnant with my sister. My mom went through such burdens trying to get pregnant, and now I'm going through those same things. The thing I think is great is you guys have really come through this together as a team. Some people, they don't get over things like this. They walk away from each other. I can't even imagine that. They do it, though. So, you know, what are you guys gonna do? Are you gonna... Well, that's kind of the reason why I wanted to bring you to lunch. So, we are clear to start, so... Oh, you're clear already from the doctor? So very soon. Oh, that's so good. It did feel like, when we lost Charlie, we got knocked all the way back down the ladder, because it was so hard to get pregnant the first time. But there's so much more on our side, and it means so much more now because of what we lost. And as long as Cori's okay and we're okay, then we're ready to try again. Before we really wanted it, but now we really want it. You know what, you got your whole future in front of you. And there's gonna be another baby, and there's gonna be another love. And you got a little angel up in heaven watching over you two. Ok, not what you planned, but, you know, God... you don't get to plan this stuff, God has his... he's got the plan. That's true. Is something missing in the backyard? The... like a big one, because it seems like there's a giant space there. - Yup. - Look at that red cardinal. I love that tree that's, like, all twirly and old. So we have arrived at my grandmother's house. There is home-cooked food. We're having some wine. And everything is seemingly perfect. I realize that I need to talk to my grandmother about the engagement, but you gotta ease into these things. Our cheers are almost gone. You want more cheers? No, I don't want... I don't want to. But I want you to sit down and have some too. - Aren't you starving, grandma? - No, I'm numb. You are? I want to be numb. Oh, dear, I'm going to be sorry tomorrow. So my mom lives with my grandma, who is 92 years old. She's a feisty old woman, and I love her. She had a huge part in raising me as a child. Growing up, things were tough, family split up, and finances didn't really allow us to have our own place. So, my mom and I moved in with my grandmother. She was like this safe place to go. It's like, when everything else was hectic and changing, like, I knew I could go to my grandma's house and that cookie jar would always be there type thing. Take a picture with my grandma. - Here, like, take one like this. - What? Oh, my God, that's so cute. I love my grandmother so much. She's, like, my number one lady in this world, and my sexuality wasn't necessarily part of our relationship, so why should we talk about it? But now it's not just about my sexuality. It's about my future and my life. And this is definitely something that needs to be talked about. It's the first time where I've felt nervous about actually confronting someone in fear that, even though I think that she'll be accepting, in fear that she won't. - Hi, how are you? - Baby girl. How are you? Good. How are you? - Good. - Ma, it smells delicious. What are you cooking? - The same thing that... - I know. Always. I was cooking the last time you were here. We have bread. We got lasagna. - Oh, yeah. - Yum. My childhood best friend Tiffany comes over with her boyfriend Luigi, and I just want to relax and catch up a bit. Cheers. Cheers to growing up. - Yeah. - Cheers. Yes. Mom and grandma are like, "oh we already did that." - Yeah. - "We're already there." So I wanted to actually tell you guys something. - The good thing is... - What? Let me see that. Me and Luigi are... we're thinking - about getting married. - Really? Yeah. - That's good. - We're coming. Tiffany starts talking about a wedding. I didn't even know she was engaged. What the fuck? Like, basically, everything is, like, "engagement, engage, eng... discuss." And I, for some reason, am not going there at all. I couldn't be... I was avoiding it like the plague. When are you thinking about having this? I'm... we're probably thinking within the next year it'll be done. - Oh, that's good. - I'm very happy. It's like, all right. I'm happy too. That's good. Well, that's great. It's just awkward, and I hate the way it feels. I just want Whitney to spit it out at this point. I'm just like, can you please tell her so we can get this over with? Hello. Erika, Romi. Romi, Erika. - Nice to meet you. - Pleasure. Are you ready for this business meeting? I'm excited for you. You wanted to do... well, the thing is you wanted to do this for a while. So I think it's really good. I have. And I've been hitting you up forever. - And, like, I want to do a song. - Yeah. I want to do a song. I've been... it was, like, something on my, like, list of things, - like, to check off. - Yeah. I've always wanted to do a song, so I am collaborating with my friend Craig and doing a dance kind of pop song. I do a lot of club appearances, and I think it'd be fun to have something that was mine. I still run my jewelry line, Casa Por Vida. Now I'm trying to just kind of have fun with another side... you know, a creative side of me. - So you heard the song. - Yes. You love the song. I actually really do like the song. I think it's really catchy. Loved it. And now we have to make a music video. The whole process of making music, it just brings back a lot of childhood memories. My mom's ex-wife is a music producer and a songwriter. She would write songs in the car on the way to school. And I used to sit on stage and watch her singers, like, perform. And I would just, like, dream of, like, being up there. And now I have a song. If you like it... when you said you liked it, - that's what made me happy. - I did. We listened to it, like, five times - on the way over here. - â™ª music's playing â™ª - â™ª everybody sing â™ª - See, you can sing. â™ª Ooh, la la la â™ª I love that Mercado just stopped to just go, "wait", are you actually capable of doing this?" My whole thing was like, if you're going to ask me to do something like this right now, like, how do you say no? You don't. You need to jump at this opportunity. Yeah. My thing to every work opportunity right now is yes. Yes, I can do that. Yes, I can perform. Can I? I don't know. Whether I can do it or not, I'll figure that out afterwards. I think the only thing that you need to work on is just... Breathing. Well, like, also just, like, holding a mic. Okay. So, my friend Dusty, he's going to bring me in to spend two hours with me learning how to sing with the track, sing with the mic. Dusty Ray is my ex-boyfriend. When we were together six years ago, he was in a band, and I would watch his shows and like be the lead singer girlfriend kind of thing. So Dusty's helping me out to make sure that I don't make a fool of myself. - I'd like to sit in on that. - Perfect. You need to learn how to put the microphone... - Yeah. - Here and not here. This is Romi, this is Romi. "Hey, guys." I'm like, "dude." Shit's about to blow up. So I really hope you guys are ready. - Why do you have a suitcase? - You're going to kill me. Um, I need you to give me a ride to the airport. - What? - Don't give me shit. I need to just, like, go to New York and, like, get out of here - for a few days and, like... - Without me? No, but, like, I need to go see my girl and I need, like, some "me time." And I just... I have to go. Can you please not question me and just drive me to the airport? Wait. How long are you going? I don't know. I just booked a one-way. What? One-way? I don't know. I mean, I'll just figure it out. - Don't freak out. - Okay. - It's... - I'm not freaking out. It's just really weird that you'd buy, like, a one-way. Be like, bye. No, I'm not doing that. All right. I need to get my keys. What time is your flight? In two hours. Oh, cool. I'm a really good planner. Okay. - I love you. - I love you too. Come over here and love me. Mama, it was delicious. I'm leaving, grandma. Yeah. - Bye, okay? - Bye. Well, take it easy. All right, Whitney, love you. Kisses. Bye, guys. Bye, grandma. That was so good, the lasagna. What are you doing? I wanted to... - Why are you running? - Because... well, I'm running. Yeah. Oh, no one's ever ran after me. How romantic, Titanic. No. Because I wanted to make sure you were coming to the wedding. I wanted to talk about it there when you were... when you were talking about your wedding. - I know. - But then I'm like... - So what's up? - No. Because the thing is, like, I haven't told my grandma or whatever. But I don't know if she really understands. Like, what, the fact that it's between two females? Yeah. Or the fact that it's you getting married? No, I think. Yeah, maybe the girl thing... the lesbian thing. - I think grandma loves you. - Yeah. No matter what, even when you got that tattoo on your body. And ruined your body. Grandma never has ever come down on you hard. - Yeah. - So, I don't think... Well, it's just, like, I don't know if I should... How you should? Yeah, or if I should. Like, if it even... You should. You know you're gonna have grandma's support. Grandma has a heart of, like, a lion. - Like, I just love grandma. - Yes. - So I know that she... - I do too. You know. All right, I love you. - I love you. - I love you. I love you. Call me, okay? - Okay. - About anything. - You know you can. - If you need anything, call us. - Okay. - Don't be scared. Be brave, you lion heart. We'll call you when we get there. - Lion heart. Lion heart. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - Dinner was good, huh? - Yeah. It got a little noisy there for a while. A little... a little noisy? - A little noisy. - I know you're tired, ma. No. No. Now? My favorite form of communication is just throwing it out there, boom. Throw the bomb real quick, and then tense up and wait for the response, hoping for the best. Grandma, you know I'm getting married. To Sara. Look at Sara's ring, grandma. - It's from the 1930s. - Yeah, that's pretty. Almost just like you. It's pretty. Mine was a band with seven. - Oh, really? - Seven... - Diamonds all around? - Oh, no. Just seven, they're not chips. - They're... - Where is yours? - A little bigger. - Yeah. I'd like to see it. - You want to see it? - Yeah. You know, this whole time, I'm sitting there, and I'm creating this response or creating this fear in myself of what my grandma is gonna think and say about our engagement. And, um, you know, when it's finally brought up, there was nothing weird. I felt silly for creating it into something that it wasn't. Did you find your ring? - Yeah, here it is. - Oh. Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's what my grandma's looks like. - It has a... - It's silver and platinum. - It's so beautiful. - And this is your wedding ring? - Wedding ring. - Oh, that's so cool. - You got good taste. - Yeah, I like it. Cheers. - "Cheerznik." - Na zdrowie. Salud. Hey, buddy. You okay? I don't know. Yes. No. Are you okay? I feel... oddly, like, at peace. You know? Yeah. Yeah, I know. I mean, yes and no. We're gonna do our next insemination. Very mixed, strange emotions. Yeah. It's the craziest concoction of happy and sad simultaneously ever. From here on out, there's just... there's no easy... What's going on in there? I don't know. It's just weird. I never felt like this before. Do you think we're not ready? I don't know. I just don't. It's a happy day. It's a sad day. I definitely think that Charlie... I mean, she's the reason that I'm pushing, you know. I know that she would be so upset if we just gave up. I know that, and I know she's up there, picking out the perfect little sibling. I know it. Do you think we should bring her? She's our family. Cori and I have Charlie's ashes in a very small, heart-shaped urn. It was important for Cori and I to have her with us always. It feels right that, if we're gonna try this again, that she's there with us. She's our baby. She is our baby. She will always be our baby. Let's go make a baby. Let me get the door for you. I am surprised your grandma was so good last night. - I know. - Did you see how cute she was she was showing you her band? - I know. - How cute was that? It's like, she's such an important part of my life. - Of course. - It, like, you know, I know she is not gonna be able to travel to California for the actual wedding. And it's like, you know, having her show you the wedding band and, like, having that, like, makes me want to have her there even more. You know, honestly, I was thinking about it. And I feel like, the fact that we can get legally married in Connecticut, it's like, I almost... I kind of want to get legally married here. So that means, that we'd be married, like, tomorrow? Whoa-ho, that changes things. No pressure. This is a very intense moment in my life, and none of my family and none of my friends live here, you know. It's not that I'm afraid of the wedding. It's just, you know, I should be able to share a very important moment with my family as well. I mean, are we still doing our California wedding? Yeah. Like, California would be the big, like, ceremony, like the celebration, the spiritual part. But it's like, if we did it here, my grandma could be there, you know. And we can do that separately, but we could have, like, a private little thing here and make it legal. So, are we gonna do this? Do you want to do it? Do you want to legally marry me? - Yes, I do. - It would be legal. That means there's no turning back. Fuck you California. We're getting married. Honestly, a legal ceremony, it's important in the sense that, you know, I want the same rights as a heterosexual couple would have, for sure. And it's not like gay couples can just wake up one morning and decide, "hey, let's go to Vegas and get married." You know, in the spiritual sense, the legality of things doesn't matter to me. You know, I would go through the ceremony if it wasn't legal, but, in a human right's sense, absolutely the legality part matters. That means you can't back out, and I can't either. So, if I'm gonna run, I better do it now. - I'm out of here. - Okay. Yeah. - Hi, hon. - Hey. - How are you? - How are you? - Thank you for helping me. - Oh, yeah. Totally. I appreciate it. I just pretty much need to... I need to know how to just sing the song through. Like my breathing, what I'm supposed to sing. What I'm not supposed to sing. I don't want to look like a fool. Uh, you won't. - Because... - I need you to help me. You're Romi, so you're cool. And you're Dusty, and you're going to help me. Right, I'll make sure you keep your cool. Dusty has been doing music since he was 16. He almost got signed when he was 18 years old. He's opened for a ton of big artists, did warped tour. And he's gonna help me with my song and sing the whole thing through and just have my voice go over it so I feel comfortable before performing, 'cause I've never done this before. - My girlfriend Kelsey's coming. - Oh, okay. We'll have a little bit of an audience, and then Mercado's coming because she's gonna hopefully film a little bit of this. - Mm-hmm. - Just to put into the video. - You want to? - Yup. Let's do it. Watch me. I'll take dramatic breaths. - All of it. - You jump in. Remember, just if you don't have a word, breathe. Okay. 'Cause I don't have the lyrics memorized, so... - How dare you? - How dare I? Do you want the lyrics? I got them. I'm good. Improv. Okay, ready? - I don't have to do that? - Right. So you take off. â™ª we can sleep when we're gone â™ª â™ª we can party till dawn â™ª â™ª fist is pumping â™ª â™ª everybody's jumping â™ª - Baby, like. - â™ª ooh, la la la â™ª - â™ª ooh, la la la â™ª - Then. â™ª da la la la la la la la la â™ª "Hi. My name is Romi. I'm doing great. How are you? - Are you feeling good?" - Even if that's playing? - â™ª la la la â™ª - â™ª la la â™ª Then you can get back in. I need to sound a little more energized than I am the whole time. - I feel like a little monotone. - Yeah. I mean, are you gonna have anyone sing with you? - No. - I mean, you should. - But I'm not. - You're not, though. - Oh, you can. - Let's do it. - Will you do it with me? - Of course, I will. - Really? - Yeah. Okay. Then practice singing it with me. - All right. - So I was in the studio, and we were, like, singing together. It just felt really comfortable, and I felt so much safer having him do it with me, and I could feel it, when I was singing with him and, like, looking at him, that I could pretty much zone out what was going on as long as he was next to me, and, I don't know, I just felt something in there with him, and I think he felt the same thing. I've wanted to do this, like, my whole life, and why not try it with somebody that has so much more experience and can really work with me and believes in me? â™ª We can sleep when we're gone â™ª â™ª whoa, whoa â™ª - â™ª we can party till dawn â™ª - â™ª whoa, whoa â™ª â™ª we can sleep when we're gone â™ª â™ª music's playing â™ª â™ª everybody's saying â™ª â™ª saying ooh-oh, la la la â™ª Romi's so natural at everything. You just got to get the artist in tune with themselves, and, once they do that, they can do anything. It's about having fun on the mic and being yourself. And she's just so good at being her that it's so interesting to hear. - And at the end of it... - Hi, baby. Hey, baby. How is it going? - Give me a hug. - Yeah. Want to meet Dusty. - Dusty, Kelsey, Kelsey, Dusty. - Hi, Dusty. - How are you? - Nice to meet you. At first I was a little weary about Romi making music with her ex-boyfriend, but I met him, and, you know, Dusty has a girlfriend, so he doesn't seem like a threat at all. I actually thought he was on my team and gay, but apparently he's not gay. Wow! I just got that. - No, he doesn't. - A little bit. - No! - But he's a cuter version. - He's cute, right? - He's way cuter. - And you seem like a nice guy. - He's a nice guy. I said that. I'm like, "you'll actually like Dusty." From the top. Let's do this. â™ª We work hard every day of the week â™ª â™ª and when the weekend comes â™ª â™ª it's time to be free â™ª â™ª don't worry about your problems tonight â™ª â™ª just lose yourself in the music tonight â™ª Romi's an entertainer, and she loves to entertain, and her making pop music is what she wants to do, she should definitely do it, but is it good? I don't know. Look, listen to it, tell me what you think. - â™ª The music tonight â™ª - Whoa. We did good. Dusty, thank you darling. I've never had, like, alone time or, like, downtime in any way with Kiyomi, so, while I'm in New York, I wanna, like, figure out, like, what her intentions are and what the hell is going on, you know, and I have every intention to call her out and talk to her. Laura's having a dinner party, so I figured that I would invite Amanda to kind of, you know, clear the air and really just get to know her a little more. You're always gonna question the person who's going after your best friend because you don't ever want to, like, give the okay and give the final approval. If they end up being a dickhead, you're like, "shit." The only thing that I can do is be myself and be authentic. If she likes me, then she likes me, and, if she doesn't, then she doesn't. There is nothing that I can do about that. Huh, here we are again. I never thought we'd be back here. Hi, guys. Here you go. So just hang for about ten minutes or so, okay? - Okay. - And I'll be back. All right. I can't believe it. It's the same batch. Oh, my gosh. That's crazy. When doctor Morris handed us the vial, to bring it back to life, I looked down, - and sure enough it's... - It's from the same... the same batch that created Charlie. We know you guys work. You can do it. I mean, we're hoping that's a lucky batch. Like, very, very hopeful that we can make the same magic. Yeah. Where's Charlie? I know. You ever think your mouth would be that close to some sperm? That's... really? Really? That's what we're doing with this? No, but if this is what I got to do to make a baby, then yes. Hey, guys. Okay, ready? - Yes. - Okay. Go ahead. Scoot back. I hope my cervix isn't an asshole today. Why does this have to be so uncomfortable? It could be worse. You could have a dude on top of you. Sorry. No offense, Dr. Morris. Because of the last pregnancy, it's easier than it used to be. Oh, thank you. So it went in very smoothly and easily, okay? Okay. - I'll see you guys soon, okay? - Okay. Thank you, Dr. Morris. You're welcome. It's okay, baby. It's gonna be okay. Promise? I promise. Look at this. Thank you for the welcome. Sara and I go over to my Uncle Tryg's house, my dad's brother, and kind of give them the heads up on our wedding, our engagement, and the fact that we could potentially/are getting legally married in Connecticut. - So we're engaged. - Yeah. - Obviously, I told you. - Yes. - See, look, show them the ring. - Congratulations. Oh, it's a chocolate diamond. - It's really beautiful. - Isn't it cool? It looks purple sometimes. Sometimes it looks yellow. - It's gorgeous. - I love it. - The wedding is fairly soon. - Where's it gonna be? It's gonna be in... in Southern California. Do you think you'll be able to come? I hope. If I can. - Okay. - Um, Dan isn't coming. - To the wedding? - Mm-hmm. I'm not surprised. I mean, he's told me that you guys doing this for the show is fine, but he wants no part of it, and... - Yeah. - I understand that. - I mean, if he... - Yeah. My dad is not coming to the wedding because he feels uncomfortable being on camera, and I'd like him to be there for such a huge event in my life, you know, that matters to me. It's my one wedding, you know, and so, yeah, it's... it pisses me off that my dad can't put whatever shit he's got going on on the back-burner and, like, make it there, 'cause the reality is he is supportive of me getting married. He just can't get over himself. This is gonna be the first and last time your daughter's getting married, and, I mean, it's, like, such an important thing for her, you know. But they're so similar, you know. - But it wasn't like that. - She's so strong, and he's so strong, and neither one's going to give in, you know. I mean, no. Yes. You don't think you're like your father? Yeah, I know I am. No, for sure. You're a clone, are you kidding? She is a clone. She is. Exactly. - I am, I am. - You're scary. Is this a legal wedding yet or not? Well, we were allowed to get married, and then the whole Prop 8 thing happened, and, like, our rights got taken away. So we might actually... because it's legal here, we might actually get legally married, like, tomorrow. Tomorrow? That's so cool. - You're stuck with me. - I know. Mom doesn't know yet, exactly. There's no waiting period, though, once you get the license in Connecticut. Yeah, what about blood tests, though? Ah, the babies. Oh, look at how excited they are. - Hi. - That's really good. Hi. Mom, we're staying longer in Connecticut. Being that we can't technically get married in California, we might actually go down and get, like, an actual license here. So you're going to get married? I didn't think you quite got that part. You didn't make it very clear. She's processing. She's processing. It's not her fault. She did not make it clear. I know. My mom's reaction to hearing that we're getting legally married is comparable to me telling my mom that we're engaged. Blank stare. She just needs a process time. - It ranges from 15 to 25 seconds. - Yeah. She's all, "we're gonna get a license." You never said, "we're gonna get married tomorrow." You just... yeah, you just said, "I'm going to the... we're going to the town hall - to get some papers." - No. In my head, it's a... that's what you said. No, because here's the thing. Like, I don't wanna say, like, the wedding. Like, we're not doing a wedding because that... this is like... that is what represents, like, our marriage even more so. It's, like, the ceremony, having everybody we love together. So you will be there tomorrow? Yes, of course I will. Oh, why would I not be? - Oh. - I want a hug too. - Come over here. - Oh, I love you guys. I love you too. You'll have a new daughter-in-law. - I know. - And it's me. "And it's me." I want to say, everybody comes together, L.A., Forkman. Let's bring... everyone, yeah. Let's bring North America together. Hey, let's spill some for Canada. My mother and I, we love cooking together. And so we've decided that we're gonna throw a dinner party for Hunter Valentine and company. We have Vero coming with Katie. Somer can't make it, so we have Donna coming in replacement. Amanda's in town, so they're all gonna get to meet my mother. No, no, no. We're not putting this on top? No? Okay. - I slaved. - What time is it? 8:15. Oh, cool, because I have a call at 8:00. Yeah, 8:15. â™ª With you know who â™ª - Who? - Lauren. So, here, this is all your finishing stuff right here. Got it. All right, everybody. Where's Amanda? Do you miss me? Yeah. Do you miss me? Yeah, so much. I'm at Laura's house right now. Her mom and her are cooking dinner for the Hunter Valentine family. Oh, I wish I was there. I'm so sad right now. You should come out. I know. I really want to. Think it's too soon for me to, like, hop a plane? No, come out. Who cares? You always psych yourself out when it comes to these things. All right. I' think I'm gonna come out. I'm gonna look at flights right now. All right. I love you, and I miss you. I love you too. - All right, babe. All right. - Bye. I'm itching to get to New York. When I like someone, I definitely don't wanna wait. I just need to see her again as soon possible. And I knew she couldn't come to L.A. I just off the phone with Lauren. - Yeah? - She wants to come out. Really? Do you think that's scary and weird? I think... I'm surprised. I mean, I'm not surpri... I mean, whatever. - Wow. - It's awesome. That's great. Thank you. - That's good. - No, that's good. That's good to start because I wanna have it... You seem a little nervous. I'm not gonna lie. Where are these reservations coming from? No, not reservations. I'm just surprised. Why? Explain. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Okay. - Can I grab some of this? - â™ª I sense a... â™ª - Okay, everybody... - â™ª lesbian freak-out â™ª - No. Kiyomi's reaction to the news that Lauren was coming to New York was not what I expected, and it was weird. You're trying to figure out, you know, if you wanna date my best friend or not, and then when I tell you she's gonna fly out here, you're not stoked about it? Like, what's your problem? No, I'm... that's exciting. I just... I wasn't expecting her to actually do that. Wait, you guys have never even actually been on a date, have you? - Like, a real date? - Nope. Uh-oh. If she flies out here, you're gonna have to take the reins on that one. You're like, "I put rose petals all over the house." "And then I put cats all over the bed. I covered the bed in cats, kittens." I actually maybe have put rose petal... not rose petal. Shut up. Not too long ago. Keep that to yourself forever. I'm just nervous about Lauren coming because everything has moved really fast, and I have, like, a super crush on this girl. And I don't really wanna fuck it up, and I don't really know where it's gonna go. So there are a lot of question marks right now. Stop trying to play it cool. It's so funny. - I'm not trying to... - Since I know that, inside, you're like a little 13-year-old schoolgirl, and you're like, "yes, I'm so excited." And you're gonna home and change your outfit 14 times before you go meet her. That might be true. Hi, Sara. - Hi. - I miss you. I miss you a lot, you know. I miss you a lot. So do you remember when we were there, I was explaining to you that, in Connecticut and New York, it's legal to get married. I don't know. Yes, it's legal here. - Okay. - Okay. So, we're still going to have our wedding in June, okay? But... Oh... Before... Sara, let me... Yes. Hmm. Mom... It's not gonna be like we're gonna... our real wedding is when our whole... our entire family and everybody's there, you know. But this is good too, mom, because... And her grandma could be here for it, you know? - Sara? - What? With you, it's so short time. You know, I'm too old for so many news and at the same time. If, like, Whitney gets sick or if I get sick, okay, mom? Uh-huh. You know, how they only allow family inside? That means that... Yeah. My mom says to me it's like a Russian salad, which means that there's just a lot of confusing components going into one thing, and I think that she's still just trying to wrap her head around us getting married in general. I love you. Okay, hold on. - Whit, my mom. - Oh, what does she want to say? - She wants to talk to you. - Hello? Oh, yeah. We're gonna do... what do you think about it? But I just wanted to tell you... - Everything. - Yay, thank you so much. I want you to know, you take Sara. Yeah. I know. Please be happy. I am so happy, and I'll... I promise you that I will take the best care of her that I could ever take of someone. - I love you. - I love... And enjoy your day, okay? Yeah. No, no. And I'm not crying, okay? I'm going to be happy. - I love you, mom. - Okay. - We'll call you right after. - Okay. Bye-bye. - Bye. - Okay. I love you. - Is she sad? - Yeah, it sucks. Once again, I thought it was gonna go differently, but my mom thinks I'm being selfish. You know, that was sad because I didn't want her to feel like, you know, we're all here and you're not, and you're missing out on, you know, this important day that we're having. I hope she's not sad. Hi, hon, how are you? Good, I got you a little... a little shot? Oh, good to see you. You too. I like your purse. It's borrowed. So what's up? I wanna hear the song that you were working on. Coffee. Yeah, I have, like, the intro and the chorus and everything put together. I think you'll dig it. I came to the studio to kind of have Dusty help me. And it felt really good. We both felt it. And we're like, let's do this together. Now we wanna try and work on another song, which is so insane that, this many years later, I would be here, like, doing music with him. I'm gonna make the best track that I can for you. And then we're gonna put your voice on it, - and that's what pop music... - Yeah. And that's what music needs. And that's what you need, is just to be real. Sometimes I just stare at you. - Hmm, really? - Mm-hmm. - Why? - I don't know. I stare at you sometimes. - Just a weird like... - It's just like a... Someone's gonna, like, see me, like, "what's wrong with her?" All right, let me hear it. â™ª all I had was myself to give â™ª - That's me. - â™ª tired of the drama â™ª â™ª I'm tired of the way we live â™ª â™ª I just wanna be alive tonight â™ª And then everyone in the club, their head explodes literally. Literally, and then, yeah. It's kind of weird. It trips me out sometimes. Like, sometimes I look at him, and he looks at me, and I'm just like, "were you a dream? Like, did you happen in my past?" My friend introduced me to Dusty in San Jose, and we started dating that day. Literally, shook hands, fell in love. We were on the balcony that night already making out. And then we dated for four months of just being together every single day. â™ª We've got a missed connection â™ª â™ª we've got something that isn't right â™ª We would just drink wine and talk about music and listen to music. It was amazing. Like, I was in love with him. Dusty left me, so it wasn't my call. That was one of the only people that ever really, like, really broke my heart. And then six years later, I get a phone call that he lives in L.A. and is working on music. I mean, our energy was cut so short - whenever we knew each other... - Uh-huh. Just getting back in the room, it was just like... - Immediate. - Just like plugging it back in. - It's just... - That's what it felt like. It's so weird because it's like... it's the same thing. Like, I told you when, like, I met you years ago and showed up in San Jose, and it was, like, within two minutes, and, like, we're in this full-blown relationship. - That's how we got... - It's how we work. That's how we do it. Good energy is good energy. And the fact that we have that still is amazing. I know. So, I mean, I just kind of feel like we should just go with it. I know you work really hard, and I know you'll get shit done, and I need a lot of, like, you behind me right now, though. I do. I love doing music with him. And he brings out a part of me that makes me feel like I'm 16 again. Like, all the things about me that I kind of miss and haven't been around, he just brings it all back. You're going to have a lot of time with me, Dusty Ray. Yeah. Your girlfriend ready for me to take over your life? Is yours? No. We're going... we're gonna get married right now legally. You know that, right? - Yeah. - Are you ready for this? - Mm-hmm. - You are? - Are you? - Yes. Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Good, how are you? - I'm Whitney. - Hi, Whitney. I'm Elisa, your wedding celebrant. Hi. Nice to meet you. - Hi. - This is Sara, my fiancÃ©e. Hi. It's so nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - You look great. - Thank you. We went to town hall and got our marriage license. And now we still have to have it officiated by the justice of the peace. So, to make things easy for my grandma, we're getting married in her backyard. They're coming up. Come on. It's freezing in Connecticut. I'm wearing a dress. I'm dressed like an amish man. So cute. Whitney and Sara, you've come before us today and freely declared your desire to be married to one another. Sara, please repeat after me. - Whitney... - Whitney... - From this day onward... - From this day onward... - I choose you to be my wife. - I choose you to be my wife. - To be faithful to you... - To be faithful to you... - All the days of my life. - All the days of my life. Whitney, please repeat after me. - Sara... - Sara... - From this day onward... - From this day onward... - I choose you... - I choose you... - To be my wife. - To be my wife. - To be faithful to you... - To be faithful to you... - All the days of my life. - All the days of my life. I, Elisa Chase, am duly authorized to solemnize this, your marriage, according to the laws of the state of Connecticut. It is therefore my honor to declare and pronounce that you are married. Sara and Whitney, you may kiss your bride. Yay. I love you. You're stuck with me forever. Fantastic. Congratulations. - Thank you so much. - Congratulations. Thank you so much. Thank you guys all for being here. I love you. - Grandma, I love you. - Yeah. I love you too. Oh, I'm happy to see they got married. It's something I have to get used to too, but it's still fine, no matter how you... how you look at it. Yeah. I think they're adorable together. Yay. Thank you. Okay, it's like a dream come true. It's cool. Yeah, it's special, for sure. Yeah. I don't think I ever thought my grandma would be at my wedding. I love the fact that my grandma was at my, like, wedding that happened to be a same-sex marriage. It's, like, huge for me. And that she was supportive. Yeah, I don't think... when I think about it right now, I don't think I ever would've thought that. So, I'm grateful. - Bye. - Bye. synced and corrected by chamallow www.addic7ed.com
