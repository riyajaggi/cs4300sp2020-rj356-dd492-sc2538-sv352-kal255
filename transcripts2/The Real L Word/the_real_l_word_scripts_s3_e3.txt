 The stars are anything but aligned for the ladies of The Real L Word. This week Cori and Kacy find themselves in a situation that many women would consider unimaginable. Whitney and Sara are in post-engagement bliss, but spilling the beans to Whitney?s Mom turns out to be harder than they expected. This is also not the best time for Romi to find out about her ex-friends? engagement, as her own relationship with Jay is faltering. A coincidental run-in with ex-girlfriend, Kelsey, threatens to push her over the edge.Romi seeks solace in a night out with old friends, but runs into more than she bargained for when she see?s Whitney and Sara there with their new friends Lauren and Amanda. Things have ended between Amanda and Britenelle, leaving the door open for Lauren to add the ?with benefits? onto her best friend. Unfortunately Lauren?s mojo is hindered by Amanda?s homesickness for New York as she reevaluates her decision to have moved to LA in the first place.Meanwhile, Hunter Valentine is en route to South by Southwest when a fight unfolds between Somer and Kiyomi that could move beyond their personal differences and affect the entire band.

 Previously, on The Real L Word... Lord, almighty. Everything that we've been doing this past year has finally worked. I think it's a girl. So, in this belly is Charlie Monroe Boccumini. I'm so excited, but I'm terrified. When I left New York, I definitely left a girl behind. Right now I'm going to pick up my best friend, Amanda. We're gonna be friends living together, and, of course, we're gonna end up hooking up. We're friends with benefits.

 What did I tell you about this person? Trouble. Lauren hates the fact that already I'm getting into something or I'm not getting into something... I don't really know, but she doesn't like it. So this tour is sort of like a trial period to see if Somer is gonna work out. If my shit breaks because of your tour, I want help. Something's not right with my synth. We're one fucking hundred percent family. Then don't give me a hard time if I have to... I'm not giving you a hard time. I'm just trying to get you to understand that I'm in the exact same boat as you. I got shit all over my face. I thought I was the only person

 - that could shit on your face. - [Laughs] Right. The thing that has kept me and Jay together is our sense of humor, but there's got to be more. Oh, my God. That little... I hate that Romi's with a man. It just kind of repulses me. Sara has corrupted her mind that I'm some sort of evil human being. Like, my whole friendship with whit is gone. - Cheers. - I think that Romi is jealous. She hated that Whitney wanted to be with me, that she didn't want to be with her. Like, she couldn't handle that. Baby, will you marry me? Oh, God. - You didn't say yes. - Yes!

It was really beautiful. It was... out of all the different engagement, um, stories that I've heard of, this was, by far, the most creative and brilliant that I've heard. [Both chuckling] I'm sure everybody has their own opinions of me being with Sara, and now we're getting married. [Chuckles] And, you know, I think we've kind of started to prove ourselves over the past year. I hope so. I'm pleased to be living with you. [Laughs] ♪ God in heaven above ♪ ♪ I'm here on the earth below ♪ ♪ completely reconciled ♪ ♪ to its purpose ♪ ♪ a true man in need ♪ Hey, how long is this gonna take? I don't know, 15 minutes. We're headed to South by Southwest today. We have a number of showcases there, and this is the most important part of the tour, so Somer has to get her keyboard fucking fixed. Don't touch anything else, or you might die of electrocution. [Laughs] I don't plan on fucking with this. Hear that? [Keyboard tone plays softly] Oh, yeah. Okay, holy shit, this might be... this... we might just... we might just... okay, you can let go of that now. I fixed it. Like, it was pretty awesome, like, that moment where I'm like, "whoa, okay, wait, I know what's wrong." "I know how to tune it. I know to get the reeerrrrr going back." How much longer? Uh, less than five minutes before this is back together. - Oh, yeah. - Which one? 30 seconds for me to change and look nice. And then, uh, a minute to pack the van. - How's that sound? - Okay, cool. - You guys ready to load? - Give me one second. Hey, you know that time that I, like, saved the band, like, $400 in repairs... what is happening? Is it a picture of me? - We're having a moment. - Yeah. It's more painful than a real one. Don't worry, I'll just be fixing all our gear. You guys have fun. I get, like, 0% love for fixing the gear. Kiyomi's lack of excitement for the fact that I fixed this... it kind of hurt. We should be psyched about it. We didn't have to pay someone. We didn't have to track someone down in San Antonio or Austin, and, like, we're gonna play a great South by Southwest show. We have to go. - Oh. - No? Here. Ow! [Laughs] [Mellow pop music] ♪ the sidewalks ♪ ♪ the city breezes ♪ A whole new business. - Hi, hon. This is Rose. - Hi. Rose, Jefferson. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. This is my virgin hair. Say hi. - Never, never been touched. - Never been touched. I mean, I have, like, very mild, very little highlights, but I never... I've never done anything. Don't be nervous. Here, give me a hug. Yeah, give a hug. He's Latin. He's family. - Oh, there you go. - We're good, we're good. I better not look like some bleached chola with roots. I know he'll do a great job, but... Yeah, you'll be fine, but that is a little bit of the look. [Cell phone rings] Oh, Ruby's calling. What up? Nothing. What's up? Getting... getting a transformation on my hair. Yeah? What up? Oh, wow, that's good. Tell them I said congratulations. I wish them a long and happy marriage. [Laughs] - All right. - Okay, bye. I don't even know what to say to that. Wait, wait, engaged? Is that what it was? Ah, what can you say? What can you say? It's beautiful. - I just wish them the best. - I wish them so much happiness. That's all you can do. Are you kidding me? They have a lot of shit there. Are they're ready to just get married and, like, say that this is forever? I'd like to see both of them commit and say something's forever. In their crazy, you know, ways, they love each other, and I wish them nothing but the best. I just don't care to have them in my life. And it just gets to the point where all the high-school little petty stuff... - It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter anymore. 'Cause you're busy. We're too busy. We have too much shit going on. Do I think that they'll make it? I don't know. But I don't think that anybody needs to go through dating Whitney again, and I don't think anyone wants to go through dating Sara again, so I pray that they stay together forever, till death do they apart.

And so we went to the emergency room, and they did an ultrasound, but they didn't check Cori's cervix. And so they sent us home, and they said everything was fine, and they sent us home. And the next day we went to our ob-gyn who said that everything was not fine. Cori's cervix was opening prematurely. Um, it's just a condition that is very rare. I was five months pregnant. The doctors tried to do a procedure called a cerclage, which would sew up the cervix to make sure that we could continue with the pregnancy, but the condition was that, um, Cori's water couldn't break. [Sobs] And then my water broke. And we made it through delivery. She came out at 9:12 p.m. The first question we asked was, "can we... can you put her in an Incubator?" And she needed two more months. [Sobbing] We were so close. She was too little. [Sobbing] And Kacy totally saw her take a breath. She was moving all day, and we felt her. She was fine. There's nothing... there's nothing that you could have done, baby. It was... you were... it was perfect. She was perfect. There's nothing. [Sobbing] It's okay.

It's fine. There you go. Okay, so we're gonna get the amp. Dude, we don't need the amp. It's... it's tuned to the tuner. You're gonna tune a guitar to the tuner. You tuned to the tuner yesterday, and it didn't work. Yes, and when I tightened it, it got flat. You don't need to haul up all of our amps to freaking set up and practice up there. I want to hear the synthesizer through the amp. But then you bring that... you bring that shit. - That's what I'm doing. - I'm not bringing it. It's stupid. It's a fucking waste of time. It's not stupid. Why are you making a big deal out of it? There's a fucking elevator right there. The last couple days, Kiyomi's just been kind of short and snippy, and it kind of builds up after a little while. As your bandmate, I'm asking you if we can check this thing, because when I put... Fine, then go get your stuff, and we'll do it. I'm telling you, it's a waste of time. That's what we're here to do. It's just this perfect storm of the stress before South by Southwest, the stress of whether the synth is gonna work, you know, me not feeling appreciated. Me feeling like I'm sacrificing everything to be part of this band. I don't know why you have to be so difficult, dude. I don't know why you have to be such a bitch all the time. I'm not a bitch, because you can't hear your fuckin' tone, and I respond with you with the same tone, and then you realize when you're constantly rude... I don't ever give you this attitude. When you're constantly rude to people. You always talk like this to everyone. - No, I don't. - You talk like we're... Yes, you do. No, I don't. Why do you think they call you "the dictator"? - I don't care. - 'Cause you're mean. - You know what? I'm not. - You can be really snippy. No, you're a self-entit... you're a fuckin' self-entitled little asshole sometimes. You're talking about yourself, dude. No, I'm not. You need to check yourself. I don't know what you're talking about, dude. I'm laid-back and chill. Okay, then talk to the rest of the bandmates - and see what they say. - Okay, you know what? You cannot go through a day without complaining about a single fucking thing. You can't... you can't go through a day without talking to people in a really nasty tone. I talk to you... and I know it's your personality, but it's grating. I talk to you exactly the same way that you talk to me. - It's grating after a while. - Yeah. You respond, and... and you're mean about it. So is your fuckin' self-entitled little pissy piece-of-shit attitude. All right. She's done. I'm not... I'm not... I'm fuckin' done with her. Like, I don't understand why it's such a big deal to try and do this. I don't even want to play with her. I said, "you're self-entitled," and she goes, "you're talking about yourself right now, dude." [Scoffs] Really? - I put fuckin' eight years of... - You know what? Blood, sweat, and tears into working. That's not self-entitled. ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ [Dance music] ♪ ♪ Why are you taking that off? Because we can't have this outside... there's, like, fabric. It'll smell like shit. - So we just want the wood part? - Yeah. It's gonna take us, like, an hour to get this fabric off the wood. Right. [Laughs] - How many people do you think we're gonna be able to fit in this thing? - A lot. How many? At least eight. [Laughs] So we're gonna have our pre-parties in the pod? Yep. We're building this thing, and we're calling it a pod, 'cause it looks like a giant bed that goes outside. The pod is for laying outside, and you could throw the curtains down and maybe hook up with somebody in some warm weather. You think this is strong enough? Strong enough for all the lovin'? No, I think we're gonna have to... well, there's supports in there. Is Brittenelle gonna be taking a turn in the pod? No, she's not gonna be coming around anymore. I just had to break it off. Lauren definitely, like, scared brit off. It was very prevalent that they didn't get along. Like, even the energy when they were in the same room together, it was like, woof. You need to do one thing at a time, and getting into a relationship - doesn't make sense right now. - Yeah. The first time in years you've been single... since we met, been single, and you're like, "I'm gonna wife up." It's a little annoying that Lauren scared her off like that, but there's no point in upsetting Lauren, so I'm just not gonna say anything. - [Laughs] - Yeah. You were like, "what are you doing? I need to shake you." Yeah. I tried to shake you. ♪ The black widow starts again ♪ ♪ and anyone's a target ♪ ♪ and you're up, up in my web ♪ ♪ up, up in my web ♪ [Line trilling] ♪ said you're up, up in my web ♪ - Hey, Kiyomi. - Hey. I might fucking kill this girl right now. Like, I... I... I'm losing my shit. I don't even know how we're gonna make it back to New York, to be honest. When Somer called me The Dictator and that everybody thinks that you talk to them this way, like, she's stirring the pot. I needed to call my manager to check myself, like, "okay, am I asking for something that's so unreasonable?" I just... I just feel like lately I've seen a side of you... it's pretty intense. When I get irritated or, you know, when I'm disagreeable, it stems from somewhere. It comes from something. This is just random. I feel that you've been also kind of talking very, like... - Sharp, right? - Very, very sharp. I think that Kiyomi and Somer are both very strong individuals, and it's hard to challenge Kiyomi. Like, this cannot continue, 'cause it's coming to a point where everyone's just getting fed up with one another. And it's gonna show onstage. It scares me that, you know, you... you're gonna have a bad show, and you don't have bad shows. - I know. - If she doesn't want to play, then she doesn't have to stay, you know. Yeah. It's just hard when, like, you know, we're all laying it out there and we're all sacrificing, and, like, every step... I feel like every day I get snapped at. Kiyomi's strong personality started, like, getting to Somer, and right now in Austin, there's... there's a lot of tension in the air. - Do you have a key? - I don't have a key. What? That's why it's become a problem, you know? Listen, dude, we're talking about, like, the tones and stuff, you know? And we're all admitting that we're all sensitive, that we all get stressed out. I really... like, I'm gonna step in right now, and I love you guys so fuckin' much. You know what? I don't even care about Lovefest right now. I care about the shows. That's my main concern. I don't really care whether you guys call me the dictator, I have a job to do, and I... The dictator was a joke. Yeah, but, no, that's not the way that... She said a lot of things that are really offensive and really disrespectful. I'm trying to just, like, remain calm, even though I've already freaked out, and, you know, get my head back in the game to play this show, because the whole point of the tour was to get to South by Southwest, and I'm definitely not gonna let it get fucked over by the fighting with Somer. In general, I think that you're pretty disrespectful, and I feel like you are self-entitled. I can't operate under being yelled at on a constant basis. I'm not yelling at you on a constant basis. You're just short. - Yeah. - That's all. ♪ Ain't no point in trying, you can't please everyone ♪ ♪ so why should I care ♪ ♪ about my reputation? ♪ ♪ my reputation ♪ ♪ my reputation ♪ ♪ my reputation ♪ ♪ why should I care about my reputation? ♪ [Line trilling] Are you going home right now? Oh, was it okay at work today? Good. Um... I miss you, and I just want to see you more, that's all. I want one so bad. I don't want a goldfish. - Huh? - Nothing. I know that Jay is not 100% in this relationship. He doesn't ask me when he doesn't see me for a few days what I'm doing, where I've been, why we haven't talked, how my projects are going, did I finish. He doesn't ca... I don't even think he knows what I do. Anyhow, I just miss you, and if you cared at all what I was going through, I thought I'd share it with you. [Chuckles] It's just starting to, like, hit me that maybe where I put him in my life, he doesn't put me. All right, well, I will text you tomorrow, then. All right, bye. Everyone around me in my life is getting married and, like, starting their families. He loves me so much. If I had a partner that was emotionally in the same place, um, I would love... love to get married and start a family. It's awesome.

It's a horrible idea to fuck your roommate. If this turns into something where we get in a fight or something, and I just moved 3,000 miles away, it's not like I can just go take off for a little bit. I love Lauren... I think she's beautiful and amazing, and she's my best friend in the entire world. And I don't want to make her feel, like, rejected in any way. So it's like this weird balance that I'm, like, trying to keep. - Hi, guys. - Hey. How are you? How you doing? - Good to see you. - How are you? Good to see you. - You too. - Come sit. Are we interrupting a conversation or... ? Um, no, we're just talking about my girl drama. Oh, nice. - Do you know Brittenelle? - Yeah. Well, we started hooking up when I got here. Like, touchdown L.A... like, night touchdown L.A., like, started hooking up. Now she hates me. - Now she hates you. - Why is it odd? But it was just, like, I don't know. She's a little uncomfortable about Lauren. And why would that girl be uncomfortable? Well, we hook up, so... Lauren is like, "I'm naked. Come in my room." It's like having a live-in chef, you know. [Laughter] Lauren and Amanda, the whole friends-with-benefits thing... if you're hooking up, someone will catch feelings. So one of you motherfuckers got some feelings going on. If I had to put money on it, I would say Lauren has the eye for Amanda a little... a little stronger. It's crazy, 'cause we, like... we can have that casual-sex thing, too, with each other. [Laughter] I mean, we... Sara sometimes doesn't like it. Do you guys, like, tangle your dreads together? - [Laughs] - Avatar. We're like... Avatar. Wait a minute. Have you guys ever fucked? Hey, there was a couple of months where she slept in my bed more than anyone else ever. - Oh. - There was no sex, though. Wait. Yeah, no, I would never. I mean... [laughter] [Laughter] Like, I think that we slightly got propositioned to a threesome. Yeah, that kind of happened. I'd want to bone us. - [Laughs] - I'd bo... I do bone us. [Laughter] - I'm not kidding... a little bit. - She's like... I want to do it... I think we could do it. I think we actually could. Oh, yeah, it's cracking. After the conversation with Jay, I went to have fun with my friends. I don't get out much, and I don't get to just dance and play with my friends. And I didn't want drama. That's good! [Shouts indistinctly] Romi walked in, and I just feel like the energy kind of shifted. And there was, like, a weird tension in the air. But why would she... a lot of people have fucked her ex. It's probably because you're a pretty girl in L.A. She sees you as the competition. And anybody who's a competition for her, she wants to... - Yeah. - Analyze and try to destroy. You know, it's definitely come out that there's been some tension on Romi's part towards Lauren. You know, after Kelsey and Romi broke up, Kelsey wanted to go out and have fun. Lauren was part of her fun. And she'll hate on you because you're pretty. She'll hate on you 'cause you're new and pretty. Like, she'll do anything to get over on someone. She'll fuck your girl. She'll fucking take... fuck your man, apparently. I'm sorry, but the fact is Romi needs to be called out more often... fact. It was a little awkward seeing Lauren and Whitney and Sara. I hooked up with Whitney. I'm a threat, and it's probably safe to say that Sara doesn't want me around Whitney at all. - Shots! - You're getting one. ♪ Well, here we go again ♪ ♪ I hear you callin' ♪ She's not answering. What? But you asked... you wanted to talk, and now you just suddenly don't want to talk? On top of the bullshit with Somer, I'm really not prepared to deal with Ali at this point. I'm trying to, like, stay focused because we have to play a show, and that's the most important thing. - Are you upset? - No... We're not understanding each other right now, and, like... we shouldn't be talking. Like, there's... we can't even communicate properly. Dude, I can't just call you whenever I want. I'm in a van with people. By that time, we had just arrived in Austin. I got in a huge fight with Somer, and she's pretty much out of the band. What do you fucking want from me? I'm still trying to call you after I'm pushing all this shit across town. I haven't played yet. Like, you... you're not the least bit understanding whatsoever. What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? I understand what you're saying, but I'm saying I don't have a choice, and I have to go. It's not my... I'm a... oh... - We got to set up! - I have to go. I have to go set myself up and play a show right now.

On top of all the drama that has happened throughout the day, uh, we get to the first venue, and we're totally late... like, an hour late. They're telling us that we were supposed to be on at 11:30 for our second show, and in the contract that we had, it said 12:30. This is a really bad look. We're late. We had no idea. We don't have a sound check. So we're not able to test the keyboard. You know, basically, we're gonna have to trust that this keyboard's fixed.

She's very sweet to me, and she's not wasted. And she got sober for herself, and we've been broken up, and she's still sober, and she's out tonight not getting involved with the mix, not getting involved with the drama.

[Sighs] Maybe we should just ask Alyssa and Whitney to come over. - Let's just get it over with. - Okay. I'll just text her right now. [Sighs] [Cries softly] It's okay, babe. Come here. [Sobbing] ♪ The city speaks to me ♪ ♪ as I walk through the city streets ♪ ♪ the city speaks to me at night ♪ - It's a beautiful day. - I'm starving. I know. Me too. Um, yesterday was insane. The whole reason the fight started, in my opinion, is because I started getting annoyed when she said, "aren't you so glad that I fixed the keyboard? I saved the band so much money. Now you guys don't have to pay for all my stuff." I'm like... in my head, I was like, "we were not gonna pay for that anyway." You know, I really... like, she's my friend, like I really love Somer. I think she's awesome. But when it's bad, man, it's fucking bad, like... I felt frustrated, because when I play a good show with Somer... when the band plays a good show with Somer, it feels so good. But when we have to put up with some of her bullshit, it just seems like maybe it's not worth it. I think once this tour's done, we should weigh out the pros and cons, um, and we should come up with a list of, like... "Is this what we need from you to be in this band." But is she who you want anyway? I like her, but I can see... I mean, I never fight with anyone, really. - And I've had so many... - Yes, you do. [Laughs] I don't know why you think you're this peacemaker all of a sudden. You're a fuckin' fiery Italian fighter. I just don't like to fight. Nobody likes to fight, I don't think. - Yeah, but... - Maybe Alex likes to fight. I've never... I've never had an argument with Vero. I mean, like, not really... one, maybe. [Laughs] I've had two fights with Somer on this tour. Yay! Oh, she's gonna throw down. - Throw 'er down, baby. - Oh, my God! I don't think she's a bad person. She was my friend. I just... you know, we need to all be on the same page. Oh, that girl's... babe, behind you. [Laughs] Hello. Ha ha ha. ♪ Rock, baby, rock, baby, rock, baby, rock, baby ♪ ♪ rock, baby, rock, baby, rock, baby, rock, baby, rock ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ rock, baby, rock, baby, rock, baby ♪ I feel like it's like I see you Friday night, then you go to work, and then I see you Sunday, and then that's it. And during the week, we're not spending any time together. That was my argument when you were looking at apartments in long fucking beach. Well, you weren't helping me find a place. You're an adult. So? You're my boyfriend. - Oh. - Oh. I help you all the time. You help ram your penis into me and hold me tightly afterwards while we watch football and eat the meats. - And you're welcome. - [Laughs] As my boyfriend, you should help me find a place that's near you, otherwise, you should fill that gas tank up the way that I fill mine up and come see you all the time, because I want to see your face. You're the only one. That's why I bought an apple. So you could Skype me from long beach to Hollywood? So we can do that... Jay's defense mechanism is humor. Let's just make a joke about it, and then we don't have to talk about it, don't have to feel it. He doesn't want to feel anything. Well, the way you talk to me, it doesn't sound like somebody who loves me. Why are you talking shit like that? - Am I crazy? - You're a train wreck. I'm not a train wreck. You're still calling yourself a lesbian all the time. It makes it a little weird to be in a relationship with you. You're not a lesbian. I'm sorry, when you date a boy, you become not a lesbian, you become a heterosexual or a bisexual. Shouldn't you love me for exactly who I am? - You're growing on me. - Uh... When I'm having sex with you, there's love behind it, and it hurts. - It hurts so good, though. - It hurts in here. - What's that? - My heart. Because you don't know the scars you're putting in me. You know how hard I work to fix this fucked-up-ness, and you are ruining it. Romi wants too much too fast from me. She wants to, you know, be together all the time and, like, live together and all that stuff, and we're just not, in my opinion, at that level, and it's really frustrating her, and I can see it, and I feel bad. Our opinion of how the relationship should be at this point is a lot different. Okay, let's get into it. The last time we dated, we broke up again because why? - 'Cause I was a drunken mess. - Right, okay. Then you started dating somebody else, and I started dating my ex-girlfriend. We break up, you decide you want to be friends with me again. [Coughs] And then I said to you, "this is probably really not a good time." And you said, "I'll take you any way I can get you." Let's just see what happens." And that's what you got. How long do I go knowing that I'm not really there with you and just taking what I can get? But you knew this was how it was gonna be going in. Don't cry. I love you, and you like me. I feel like I'm giving a lot of myself into this relationship. [Sniffles] And... like, I'm not getting it back, and it's... already, like, a really scary relationship to be in. I mean, I think that Jay is just kind of along for the ride with me, but he's not, like, with me. It was me saying, "hey, I really want to try this again," and you being like, "oh, you know we have fun, "and were friends, like, we enjoy each other. Let's just do that." But it wasn't like, you know, like you really wanted to be in something with me. I know it's not what you want, but it's what I can offer you. And what if what somebody can offer you isn't enough? Then that's something you need to think about. Mm-hmm. ♪ When I was a child, I held to my mother tightly ♪ You know? Uh-huh. ♪ But they didn't bring me ♪ ♪ everything I hoped they might ♪ ♪ I fell into love ♪ ♪ like a skydiver in the clouds ♪ ♪ it wasn't enough ♪ ♪ no, we couldn't sustain it ourselves ♪ Hi. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? You're so close, yet so far away. My mom and I have always been super close. And my mother loves Sara. They have a great relationship. I think my mother is gonna be very excited for us. - Uh-huh. - [Gasps] - Do you like it? - Yes. Well, on that... on that same topic, she has another ring to show you. What is that? What do you think it is? - Are you kidding? - [Laughs] We're engaged. [Laughs] - Okay. - [Laughs] You're not happy? Ma, you're not even excited. I'm engaged! - She's surprised. - Well, yeah, I don't... Are you shocked? - We'll see how it... - [Laughs] If it... [laughs] What? It's stra... It's strange that I'm engaged? I'm, like, a little upset at the reaction from my mom. You know, I'm telling her one of the biggest announcements of my life. It's not necessarily what you envision in your head - your parents' reaction being. - Oh... Love you too. [Laughs] Mwah. Okay, bye. Bye. I don't know. It's okay. I thought my mom, out of everyone, would be super stoked right off the bat, and it's a little discouraging, you know? She loves you so much, babe. You know? And, like... I don't know. I love you. I love you too. - I love you. - Love you too. [Mellow pop music] ♪ ♪ You stopped being with men how many years ago? I don't know... like, seven, eight years ago. Okay. And then when you look at everything that transpired from then... Like, when dad died, I think that my thoughts at that time was like, I'm just gonna run and go somewhere where I found safety, which was, like, watching you with Tina, and a woman relationship was my home, was what I knew. And that's when I started dating, and I was attracted to women, and I wanted to explore that, and I wanted to find out at that time what part of me wanted to connect with... and be with women. What I did, though, mom, is like I just shut out any opportunity with any man at that point. It was like, no more, I'm done, no guys. Mm-hmm. I'm dealing with, like, you know, my issues with Jay and stuff, and I think that a lot of what I went through growing up is coming up, a lot of... the way I was raised. How I want to start a family, what does a family look like to me? Is it a woman and a man? I don't know what it's like to date a man other than Jay. Right. And it's like when he sits there and he's like, you know, "I don't really love you," it's like, "well, maybe you don't, "but maybe there is somebody out there that does, and you're not the only guy." And he's so used to being just my only guy. I'm in a place, mom, where I feel like, what if I don't like men? And when I want to go back to women and that that's where I feel safe, and that's not a good place to be. I want healthy relationships with men in my life, but I don't get them, I don't understand them, where with women, I mean, it's all I've ever been raised and known. And, like, with my dad being gone, like, there's parts of me that wants to have that relationship so bad in my life. But where I'm searching for it, I don't know. You're figuring it out. You don't have to have all the answers tonight. I have to go work. I love you. I love you too, baby, very much. Don't worry about what people think, Romi. ♪ There's a rhythm in my heart ♪ ♪ that keeps it beating ♪ ♪ ♪ You're gonna do all the talking, right? Absolutely. [Knock on door] [Sighs] - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Come on in. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey. Come on in. [Laughs] Well, so there's something obviously missing. We just wanted to tell you guys in person. Um, Cori went into preterm labor, and the doctors couldn't stop it. So, um... so Charlie, our little girl, came way early... too early, and, um... she couldn't survive. [Whispering] Oh, God. Oh, my God. So I know that you guys wanted a throw us a baby shower and everything, and it just... we wanted to tell you and let you know. [Sniffles] Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, guys. I'm so sorry. We haven't really told anybody. Like, our family and our best friends know. - Yeah. - I mean, I've... I don't know how. So we were just kind of hoping that maybe you guys could help us just tell some people. Of course, of course. To be sitting in a room with a couple that's just lost their child that you care so deeply about, it's like you don't know what to say. I mean, they had to deliver her. Yeah. And I saw her take a breath. So she made it, like, all the way out. And Kacy got to feel her move for the first time that day, and... - She was really cute. - She was really cute. - She looked exactly like Cori. - But we got to hold her and... You did? Mm-hmm. You know, my mom... she had a set of twins before my brother and I that she lost at six months. And then she ended up having us, so just don't be discouraged, you know. We're both here for you, for sure... and anything you need us to do. I'm so sorry. I have to hug you guys. [Laughter] I got to go over there. [Murmuring] I think it's the only thing that is just helping me get through this is just having that memory of seeing her face and holding her little hands. Do you guys want to try again or what? Is that a weird question? - We're going to. - Yeah. Yeah, the doctor said I would be... I would be ready physically... mentally probably not, but... - Yeah. - I would be ready physically. And I mean, seeing how long it took last time, like, it just... We want to still be parents. We are parents. I mean, we have a daughter... you know. She is my first. She'll always be my first. But we're gonna try again. Another special soul will come into your guys' life, I'm sure, you know. You guys are gonna be awesome parents. Absolutely. Thanks. It's just... it so hard to think about the future. I'm just so stuck here now. [Sniffles] ♪ So I'll take this bright, new day ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ the birds just fly my way ♪ ♪ and whisper ♪ ♪ "it'll be all right" ♪ Hey. I'm homesick. - Homesick? - Yeah. - Oh, man. - [Laughs] Honestly, coming here and leaving my ex-girlfriend, even hooking up with another girl, if anything, makes me miss her so much more. I still have very strong feelings for my ex-girlfriend. It's like, you can't have a long relationship with somebody, get up and leave, and not expect that you don't have, like, these unresolved feelings. If I brought to the table right now to Lauren that I miss my ex-girlfriend, after all the shit that happened with brit, she would kill me. It's weird, like, not having my friends around all the time, you know? I mean, I have friends out here, but not like my friends in New York, you know? And I miss you guys. [Chuckles] I miss you too, man. Come back home. I know. You know, if it doesn't end up being, like, everything I want it to be, then I'll probably move back. But I can't tell Lauren that, 'cause she'd probably freak out. I love spending my time with Lauren, you know. But I don't need a mom. Like, I don't need somebody asking me where I am all the time and what I'm doing and what's going on and, "what time are you gonna be home?" And it's just like, "let me do what I want to do. Like, chill out." - Put a smile on your face. - [Laughs] All right, I'll talk to you soon. [Knock on door] Hey. You've been in here a while. Are you okay? Yeah. What's going on? - I'm just homesick. - Yeah. So I'm being a baby. [Laughs] No, you're not. I don't think I've gone anywhere without feeling some sort of sadness and missing someone, you know. Yeah. It's good to get out of your comfort zone, and just you being upset right now and being homesick... that's making you grow. I mean, it's like when I moved to New York, it was like an extreme-growth thing, you know, and it takes a lot of courage. - Yeah. - And it just makes you a better person, you know? I have an idea. Let's take a trip to New York. - Really? - Yeah. Would that make you feel better? I feel a little better. Yay. Good. I'm glad I made you feel better, or I didn't. Maybe you just don't want to talk about it. No. You make me feel better. Mmm. I'm so glad you're here. It's totally normal to feel this way, you know. I know, I'm glad I'm here too. ♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪ ♪ ah ♪ ♪ I saw a heart break, I saw the clouds form ♪ ♪ I saw her turn away, pull up the cover ♪ I know that Jay is not 100% in this relationship, because anybody who was 100% would be more there.
