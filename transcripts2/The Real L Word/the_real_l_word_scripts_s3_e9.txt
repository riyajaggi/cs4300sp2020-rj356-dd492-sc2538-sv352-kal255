 Hi. ♪ You said we'd keep this pact forever ♪ ♪ stick around, make it right ♪ So this tour is sort of like a trial period to see if Somer is gonna work out. At this point, we're feeling like it might not be the right fit because of all the things that we have gone through. It's not only disappointing and frustrating, but a little bit heartbreaking. [Laughter] I'm not. It's already done. I think this might be a little more than just Dinah fun. I feel like there's something there. I wanted to ask you if you think you would want to, like, just see each other? Yeah. We threw the bachelor towel in. - [Chuckles] - You're my girlfriend. [Crying] It's not fair. Cori went into pre-term labor, so Charlie came way early. She couldn't survive. We want to still be parents. We are parents. But we're gonna try again. Because of the last pregnancy, it's easier than it used to be. It's gonna be okay. Promise. Oh, my God, Kacy. That says fucking pregnant. I've kind of been living this secret life. It's time to just stop. I've been dating my ex-boyfriend Jay. When you date a boy, you become not a lesbian. You become a heterosexual or a bisexual. I don't know what the fuck I want. I don't know if it's a guy or a girl. That's why I'm fucking confused! It's hard being with somebody who's bisexual. If the girl wants dick, that's not something I can give her. Camera speed. All right, rolling... action! ♪ We work hard every day ♪ I'm taking on a whole new career, and why not try with somebody that believes in me? Yeah, are you? When I met Dusty six years ago, we started dating that day. It was amazing. Like, I was in love with him. Can you stop? Come here. I see the way you guys interact, I don't like it, and I don't want to be around it. I've always been a sucker for Romi because I've been in love with Romi. You think someone's your best friend, but really, you were just a fuckin' filler. Did you ever think maybe you fell back in love with him? That's it. Dusty and I have something really strong happening that I can't control anymore. [Phone line ringing] Hey. Romi and I were really close. I truly, genuinely cared for her, but I don't trust her. She'll fuck your girl. She'll fuckin' take... fuck your man, apparently. Sara doesn't want me around Whitney at all. I'm a threat. And you don't treat people like that. Karma is a bitch. - [Sighs] - Baby... - Will you marry me? - Yes! [Applause] - What is that? - What do you think it is? - Are you kidding? - It's not necessarily what you envision in your head, your parents' reaction being. [Speaking portuguese] I hope it's something good. [Speaking portuguese] [Sobs] I never believed in gay marry. I thought marry is for woman and a man. The fact that we can get legally married in Connecticut... I kinda want to get legally married here. It's not like gay couples can just wake up one morning and decide, "hey, let's go to Vegas and get married." It is therefore my honor to declare that you are married. Are we still doing our California wedding? Yeah, like, California would be the big, like, ceremony, like, the celebration, the spiritual part. We are a month out from our big main event, the California wedding, and we have a lot of fucking things to do. - What are you doing? - Don't piss me off. - I'm over this. - I think right now we're going through a bunch of anxiety and stress and all the planning, and it's just a lot. Well, let's deal with our fuckin' issues together. There's no one else in the world I'd rather be with. ♪ 'Cause life, it runs out too soon ♪ ♪ and all that I want to do ♪ ♪ share the love that I have with you ♪ We have to print these. - Print what? - These labels. Oh, I thought you printed them. - I just bought these. - Oh, you got that. - Yeah. - Oh. I thought you got a stamp, babe. That's what we talked about... getting a stamp. Where are you gonna stamp it on? We talked about putting a sticker on there. - You can't stamp... sticker. - What kind of labels are those? We're just gonna print out little labels, babe. Okay, fine. Whatever. I don't care. If you want to go get something, then get something. No, I'm just saying I don't care. It's fine. It really doesn't matter. Fuck it. It's two days before the wedding. I love that we're going into our wedding with such harmonious energy. We literally want to kill each other. Times are tense. We can't get along. I can totally see why people get married several times. What? No. I also think it's weird that you're wearing a veil, considering in no way are you virginal. Or am I, like, lifting it, like, "who is this virginal person I will be experiencing for the first time tonight?" You're the one that's taking the symbolic part of it to heart. I'm wearing it for a fashion statement. Well, baby, I think it looks beautiful. Oh, thanks. [Cell phone chimes] - Babe. - Huh? My dad just texted me right now. What did he say? He said, "is there room for two more on Sunday?" I guess he wants to come. Of course he does. The thought of my dad not coming, it was very upsetting. I want him there. We're just so prideful. You know, we're cut from the same cloth. Or I guess I'm cut from that cloth. But, um, he's coming, and I think it's a good thing. I think he'd be sad if he didn't. I'm happy. Me too. ♪ Baby, baby, close your eyes ♪ ♪ baby, baby, don't think twice ♪ ♪ I want you ♪ ♪ I want you ♪ Just so you know, you're auditioning right now too. [Laughs] I'm always auditioning. When am I gonna make the band? Since we fired Somer, we've been touring as a three-piece. And we've been playing pretty well, but we're definitely looking for that fourth member. Hey! Hello... you guys. - Aimee! - Hey! - Vero, this is Aimee. - Hello. - Hi, how are you? - Both: Nice to meet you. Good to see you, dude. Give me a hug. We've brought this girl in from Toronto that we've known for a while. Her name is Aimee, she's an amazing musician, so we're about to audition her to be the fourth member of Hunter Valentine and take over Somer's role. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, one, two. You can use that guitar. This guitar is ridiculous. I say we just try, like, running through them and then, whatever. You can tell me how bad it is afterwards. [Laughter] [Drum sticks clacking] [Playing rock music] ♪ ♪ Aimee... she's kick-ass. We didn't even send her chords. She just kind of ear-lifted everything. She's a great musician. ♪ ♪ ♪ no one knows my name ♪ ♪ ♪ Pretty good. - It was really good. - Yeah. - It's loud in here. - Really good. What else can you do? [Laughter] I can actually do a lot of magic tricks. - Oh, good. - That'll be good for the road. Yeah. You can be, like, the opening act. Yeah. I'm gonna go smoke a cigarette, guys. Ah, I have a smoker buddy. - Yay. - Okay, goodie. You shouldn't be, like, being happy about this. Wait, but smoking's bad for you. I'm not gonna smoke right now. - I'll be back. - Yeah. - See you in a bit. - Cool. Why can't I smoke? Because we want to talk about... Because we need to talk about what just happened. - Oh. - She seems to be able to play everything that you need her to play. She can do magic tricks. That's awesome, but before getting excited, I just... I just hope it works out, like, with the whole, you know, commitment thing. I don't want it to get to a point... you know, I realized this with Somer, that, like, you know, it can all be great and fine and dandy, but then, in the long term, "oh, I can really tour," or in the long term, "oh, I'm never gonna move." But to me, she has a really amazing energy about her. She's very positive, and she's very comfortable with herself. [Knocks on door] - Come in. - So, you... - What? - Nothing. You should. - Are you drunk? - No. [Laughter] Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up. Good job. Thanks, guys. I have a question. Like, a serious question. How attached to Toronto are you? - Cats are portable. - Yeah. Attachment to Toronto is different from... if it... if it... if it's better, then I would move. Like, that's... the point is that it's for the band. I feel like aimee is the perfect fit for Hunter Valentine. She can play lead guitar like Jimmy Page, she has got the swagger, and she has touring experience, which Somer didn't have, and it showed in an extreme way on this last tour. So for the next few weeks, we want you to wear skinny jeans. [Laughter] - You got the job. - Hey-oh! - Yes! - You nailed it. Just don't nail anyone in the band, and you'll be fine. ♪ Somebody ♪ ♪ somebody tells you to lie ♪ ♪ forget it ♪ ♪ no, nothing bad, no ♪ This is my song? ♪ I'm in love, I'm in love ♪ - I told you I'd write one. - I know. - ♪ I'm in love ♪ - baby, love it. ♪ I'm in love, I'm in love ♪ I want to scream. And blast it and sing it. Scream it. ♪ With you ♪ As soon as me and Kelsey break up pretty much, I'm in a relationship with Dusty. When we were in the studio, I didn't know what the hell was gonna happen at all. I didn't think that we were gonna end up like this again. I mean, it had been so long. But there are some people in your life that you meet, and it just takes over everything about you. You can't even control it, even if it's the wrong time or the wrong place, in the wrong situation. It was just inevitable. You can't put me and Dusty together without us being in love. And we have history. It's not like we just met. It's my song. And just want to, like, put my heart back into Dusty. My mom asked me if I was gonna marry you. What did she say? - Yes. - [Laughs] And run off? When we were together six years ago, and he asked me, like, drunk, "will you marry me?" And I said, "yes," but he was too young, and he needed to grow up, and I needed to grow up. I don't ever want to lose him again, and I know that he doesn't ever want to lose me again. And we spent six years apart. And we just, are so in love, it's stupid. Let's see where mom's at. Let's tell her. [Phone line ringing] Hey, mom, are you there? Yeah. I gotta tell you something. What? Um, Dusty and I are getting married. [Laughter] Like, you're kidding, right? No, like, we're gonna get married. What? We're gonna get married. Dusty. We... we love each other so much. So you're, like, serious. What... what is happening? Like, for real. You know what I'm saying? Marriage is for real. - We're gonna do it. - You guys, seriously. This is, like, a serious thing, and you've talked about it, and you understand the commitment and... - Yep. - Oh, my God. Okay. Bye. [Beep] She's crazy. ♪ Can't tell if you like boys or girls ♪ ♪ boys or girls ♪ ♪ boys or girls ♪ ♪ I can't tell if you like ♪ Let's bring, like, a few boxes of stuff. Trial send, I mean. Let's bring a trial period amount of boxes. Right now, we're in the process of packing up and moving half our stuff to New York and storing half of it in the garage. Wait, hold on. We need to bring this. Bondage chair. Wait, we should bring it. That was a joke present. I'm so excited to be moving back to New York. It's just gonna be incredible to kind of, like, relearn the city, go back to my favorite places, and do it all with my fabulous girlfriend Kiyomi. We should probably, like, finish the pod 'cause the renters are gonna be like, "ew, what is that?" They're not gonna want to rent anymore. They're gonna come out here and be like, "oh, cool, I love cabanas with poo-stained carpets." [Laughter] I think we need a box just for sex toys. I know. We have some there. It's too much of a pain to carry them back and forth. I'm, like, sad. I don't even want to go anymore. You don't want to go anymore? It's not forever. We're gonna try it out. I know. I'm just, like, not that excited anymore. I mean, I definitely put myself out there to my ex and was very ready, willing, and able to not be with anyone else, and then she ended up seeing other people, sleeping with other people, so I just had to break it off. Now I'm going back to New York 'cause it's what Lauren and I have decided to do, but maybe it's not what I should be doing right now. Like, I don't want to give the satisfaction of her thinking that I'm going there to be with her, you know? So why don't you tell her you're not going and then go anyway? And if she se you out, just be like, "hey, I'm visiting." Well, that's really retarded. [Laughter] Why would I do that? ♪ Hey, hey ♪ ♪ just grab a cheap seat and settle in ♪ ♪ we've got the rest of our day ♪ Hello? [Dog barking] Querida! Hi, Judy. Hi, Judy, hi. Hello. Look at how cute your mom is. [Speaking portuguese] [Laughs] - Hi. - Hi. - [Speaking portuguese] - How are you? Nice to see you. Hi, mom. [Speaking portuguese] - Hi. I love you. - Hello. Hi. How are you? - Good, how are you? - Mom, hi, I love you. [Speaking portuguese] Well, these are our table numbers, mom. What do you think? My mom hates it. She hates it. - No, it's cute, but it's... - Yeah, it's fine. Are you ready for this? Dude, my mom's gonna die. - Let me see. - Ooh. That's a nice picture. Look at that, eh? Wow, it's beautiful. - Do you like it? - Yeah. We're gonna have both of them, I think. Beautiful pictures, yeah. - Do you want one? - Yeah, that one. We can print it here, mom. You can take it home with you guys. The last time I saw my mom, things weren't the way I expected them to be. You know, she wasn't very excited about the engagement, and my mom is still upset about us getting married in Connecticut, but this, to me, is our real wedding, and she needs to get on board with this because it's two days away. Like, mom, I need your support. [Kisses] [Speaking portuguese] Mom, can you tell me if you feel better - about this wedding? - Yeah, I'm feeling... you know, still, I'm thinking. ... Why? I don't deserve the same rights as men or you and dad? Why? My love is not as good as your love? Yeah, of course. So then, that's sad for you to say that. ... You want me to be happy 'cause you love me. Yeah, I want you to be happy, Sara, but you can be happy anyway. Yeah, that makes me happy, and I deserve that, just like you and everybody else. I'm kind of a nervous wreck. It really doesn't help that my mom is just not on board wi me getting married, and it doesn't help when she has to throw in little remarks like, "I know that you guys love each other, but why do you have to get married?" Those things really bother me because it's like, okay, I'm trying to be excited for this, but you just keep breaking me down, just little by little when you say these little things that, to me, don't even need to be said. - I'm very nervous now. - Mom, what do you mean? I don't know. This is a big thing for me. - Don't feel stressed. - She's always stressed. ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ What color is the dress you're wearing to the wedding? Like, a dark blue, I think. A blue? So... Oh, I like the one on the right. - This one? - I like that one. All right. You okay? Yeah. No. What's wrong? I need a break from trying to get pregnant, just to have our lives not revolve around pregnancy and sadness and... [Sighs] a few days after the positive pregnancy test, I went to the doctor to have my pregnancy hormone levels checked, and when he called with the results, uh, it wasn't good. They were really low, and he said the chances of the pregnancy sticking weren't good. Yeah, a few days later, I got my period, so... we're not pregnant anymore. So what if things don't work out with my body? How do you feel about... [Laughs] you know. I would do it for you. Would you want to though? 'Cause if you don't want to do it, I don't want you to do it. We can adopt. We can, you know, we... there... there are other ways. I'm not giving up on... on myself just yet. I'm not giving up on you either. And I'm not offering. That is not something that's gonna come out of my mouth. This is something that she's wanted to do her whole life, and if Cori wanted to be a dancer and she broke her leg, I wouldn't suddenly step into her recitals and just do her dance moves for her. Like, the girl can do it. She's just gonna need a little bit more help carrying, and I'm never going to take that away from her until she decides that's something that she doesn't want to pursue anymore. But if Cori turned to me next week and said, "I'm done. I want you to get pregnant," I would be scared. Personally, I have a very loose relationship with my vagina. We check in every so often. I'm not really in touch with my cycle. My period always surprises me. And if I got pregnant, I would have to be, like, in a one-on-one relationship with my vagina, and it's scary. There's someone coming out of you. It's just scary. But I would do it. If she wanted me to do it, I would do it. I've, like, gained so much weight from eating my feelings. I want to go back to the gym and just focus on me and... fix me. We should take a break, and you and me go somewhere, like... just not be on the path to pregnancy. - You know what I mean? - Mm-hmm. Just go and have fun and go on a zip-line or go to the beach and go roll around in a bikini. That sounds good. We could definitely use, uh... a getaway. We need to figure out who we are again, right? 'Cause we are Kacy and Cori, the couple trying to get pregnant, to Kacy and Cori, the couple pregnant, and now we're back to being Kacy and Cori, the couple who's trying to get pregnant, and I think we just need some time to be Kacy and Cori again. I'm just tired of being the little, sad couple. Me too. So let's be the couple who whisks away to Paris on the weekend. That's way sexier than the sad, little lesbians knitting and writing at home. [Laughs] - Right? - Yeah. ♪ So they say, how are things today? ♪ ♪ hold on, wait up ♪ ♪ where I want to be ♪ - [Sighs] - How's it going? What's up with my dress? We're just gonna, um, have, uh, Rochelle go pick up your dress. Okay. I need to get ready. Do you want to go get... How extensive is you getting ready? I'm just gonna get ready really fast. Do you want to go get the... the frames while I do that? You just go down the street real quick. It's the day before the wedding, and we have so much to do, but I'm really, really excited. I feel like the inside of my body is gonna jump out of my body, and then there's gonna be a little bodysuit laying there 'cause I'm like... I feel... Ugh, that's a horrible image. Like, you know, if I can just rip... Just a skin suit hanging on the ground? If I can zip myself down and then crawl out of my body and then run really fast and jump really high, and, like, go crazy and shake my head. What the fuck has just happened? I need, like, Xanax or something, bad. [Cell phone chimes] Babe, can you come here, please? Yeah. What? - I don't think you understand... - What? The text message I just got. Romi is in Vegas right now, getting married. What? To Kelsey? I don't understand. No, to that dude. What? Which dude? Which one? That fuckin' Dusty guy. I've heard that Romi is in love with this guy. And I just got the news that Romi is getting married. I'm shocked. Like, really? You're getting married? Why do you have to get married the same time that we're getting married? It's awkward. It doesn't seem right. There's something off about it, and it's obvious. You literally will go to any length or extreme to get one up on us. You're so competitive. Like, get over yourself. I'm sending her a text message. Fuck this. I am. I have to. I need her to know that I know she's an idiot. That's it. I'm... like, really? You... I just can't... I cannot... like, just... no. I'm so pissed. This is it. She doesn't give a shit about the community that she once belonged to at all. Like, we... this is one of the biggest gay rights movements of our time, and she just had to go fuckin' illustrate how easy it is. - Good. - It's so annoying. If anyone is ruining the sanctity of marriage, it is not gay people. It is people like her who go and get married on a whim just because they can. Send her one text, and that's it. Be done with it. And then that's done. Like, no more energy being put towards it. Nothing. Because I don't want this day to be in any way tainted by her shenanigans or whatever you want to call it. ♪ I can't take any more ♪ ♪ I'm losing my mind ♪ ♪ losing my mind ♪ ♪ foolish love pushed me right to the edge ♪ ♪ and I can't pretend ♪ ♪ not any more, I can't take any more ♪ - Aw, look at this. - Oh, it's nice.

I always dreamed of my wedding being a Vegas wedding. I was not the girl that was, like, big white dress and... it was never me. And I've done that. I got married. I had a wedding. Now I just want to run off, just get married, and come back and start our lives together. I just got a text message. - A text? - A text message. From Sara Bettencourt. Uh, she said, "good luck on your big day." "Glad you found love. You get to demonstrate how easy it is for straight couples to get married on a whim, especially during one of the biggest gay right movements of our time." She's so sweet. What does she want you to do? She wants me to, um, not be happy, and she wants me to... She wants you to do her job for her? Yeah. I thought her and Whitney were leading the gay marriage movement. That's really sweet that she made the effort to text me today. I mean, whatever. She's texted me, like, three times since that last meeting that she told me I was an awful business person, and now I'm awful 'cause I'm with a man. I'm a horrible human being for loving you. I know. So bad. It's so bad. - It's terrible. - So bad. And I think that the fact that she went out of her effort to text me on my wedding day, like, that day of all days, is just incredibly mean, and it shows what kind of person she is. And I think it's just really funny that people think that I'm supposed to be marching to some gay movement. I'm in love. I didn't know that it was wrong to marry somebody that I was in love with, and I didn't know that by marrying someone I'm very much in love with, I was letting down the entire gay community. I think it's very ignorant and judgmental. Got the dress, got the bag. My ex dog ate my vows. No one ate the vows. You have the vows. Come on. We'll be back to tear this place up. Got it?

Yeah, I kind of was thinking that. Maybe I'll just, like, take 'em to the abbey or something, so you can, like, get it in. [Laughs] Kiyomi's in town for Whitney and Sara's wedding, and I cannot wait to see her. I've become pretty close with Kiyomi's bandmates, and they're gonna stay at our house. I think they're awesome, and I can't wait to spend more time with them. - Hello. - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. Hey. I'll say hi to somebody else first. [Laughter] - How are you doing? - Good. How was your flight? When I first met Kiyomi, I actually really didn't like her. I was like, "this girl's a dumb bitch." [Laughter] No, we've warmed up to each other a lot. Do you think so, Kiyomi? Huh? As much as you can warm up to an ice queen. Yeah. So when are you moving? Um, well, when we come out for pride, we're just gonna stay, and then, um, just see how it goes, you know? Is that testing the waters with your relationship as well? No. See if you can stay in the same city? - Yeah, is it? - No. It'll be fine. I'm excited that you're moving to New York. I think that, like, you know, some people might look at it and be like, "you're moving across the country, and you guys had just started dating?" But I don't think it's that unreasonable of a thing to, like, want to live in the same city as the person that you're dating. We don't want to listen to you guys have sex, so we're gonna go to the Abigail. That's a good idea. - Bye. - Bye. - Don't be too loud. - Awkward. I missed you. Missed you. Let's just not be apart at all. - Okay. - Don't go on tour. Like, fuck tour. Okay. - Okay? - You can come with me. I've thought about it 'cause I don't want to be apart. You've thought about coming on tour? - Mm-hmm. - Like, all the time? No, I just... it, like, crossed my mind. You're cute. [Laughs] There's kind of, like, an unwritten rule in the band where girlfriends don't come on tour. It's that whole Yoko Ono thing.

Limoneira Ranch is basically, like, the dream location for this wedding. You know, it's outdoors. There's mountains in the background. There's orchards all around us. It's perfect. I will give you a hug, huh, mom? - Aw, Soph! Soph! - Go say hi to Whitney. Go say hi to Whitney. Go. - Hi, Sophia. - Hi. - Hi, guys. - Where's your mom? She's over there. Oh, look, my mom's already crying. [Both speaking portuguese] This is the first time that our family members are actually meeting, and my mom is still an emotional wreck, and it's just a little frustrating because I want my mom to accept that I love this woman and that I'm going to marry her. This is my mom, Charlene. - Hi. - Hi, mom. Nice to meet you. Finally, huh? [Laughter] - Did you meet Albert? - Hi, dad. How are you? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. We in love with your daughter. She's so sweet. - I know. - Very, very sweet. You look like your mom, no? We are very happy to have, uh, Whitney in our family. - Thank you. - Oh, I know. Did you meet our granddaughter? Three of them, three. Three. This one, Taylor, and the baby. - Mm-hmm. - No more babies. No. [Laughs] But I know that they want kids, so... [Sighs] we'll see. [Laughs] I sure hope that Whitney's mom can help make my mom feel more comfortable with this wedding. Her mom is very liberal. She's really sweet. And, you know, my mom can see that she's doing okay, and her daughter is also getting married, and her daughter is also gay, so I think she gets to see, like, the perspective of another person going through the exact same thing. It has been not easy, these two last months. - Uh-huh. - Not too easy. I know. Well, that's what I said to her. I said, you know, "well, how..." how's your parents taking this?" Albert, I think he take it better than me. This last two months has not been easy. Yeah. And I have to tell all my family. That's... that's... that's... that's the... uh, they never imagine... Mm-hmm. You know your daughter is gay long time ago, but not us. Yeah, oh, yeah. - She told us five years ago. - Yeah.

Marrying a woman or marrying a man, it doesn't matter. I'm not shocked that I'm here with a man, that's who I'm in love with. And I love him. I've loved him forever, so... it's exciting. ♪ Won't you save me from the dark? ♪ ♪ ♪ When you're searching for love, you're searching. When you're trying to make love out of something, like, it's too much effort. It's not right. Things aren't gonna click.

When you just love somebody and they love you back, it just clicks. You don't have to try for it. With Dusty, I don't have to try and be in love, it takes over my whole body, takes over my whole heart. My, my, what a big moment. We're gathered here today to join you together in marriage. This is the moment you've waited for. Dusty. Romi... our lives were on pause for far too long, and now we're gonna love each other at 1,000 miles an hour like spaceships from the future, flying to Mars, where only you and I exist I love you more than you know, and I know you love me the same, so let's go ahead and do this. I promise to love you unconditionally, I promise to be kind to you always, I promise to be the best wife and best friend I can be, to build you up and never bring you down, to take care of you when you're sick, and most of all, I promise to love you. [Laughs] Wow. [Laughs] Words have never been said so beautifully as the two of you have. I really believe that you know what love is. So, Dusty, as you look into Romi's eyes, will you take this beautiful lady to be your wife, in sickness and in health, till death do you part? Of course. Yes, I do. And, romney, will you take Dusty for your husband? - Yes, absolutely. - Tell him. I will take you as my husband. - Yeah? - For the rest of my life. - [Laughs] - Lucky. And by the power vested in me by the state of Nevada, I pronounce you legally married. - Husband and wife. - Whoo! - [Clapping] - Little white wedding chapel. Kiss your beautiful bride. - I love you. - I love you. - We did it. - I love you. - You are married! - Thank you.

Dude, this whole dress is rebuilt. It's insane. What? I'd better fit in here, or I'll... I do understand I may or may not have a dress to wear. - This is a very complicated... - Yeah, I'm stressed for you. And very, very important situation. I gotta go try it on. I'm gonna go in my mom's room. I'm just gonna see if it fits really quick. So I basically have, like, 12 hours until our ceremony, and I don't know if my dress fits. I'm freaking out a little bit. It's really stressful. This is the most terrifying moment ever. 'Cause if her dress doesn't fit, it's going to be bad for all of us. Like this. Mom, this better fit me, you guys, oh, my God. Mom, the thing is it might have to go over 'cause of my butt. Oh, my God, Sara, don't upset yourself. Oh, a little pressure. Oh, yes. - Wait, mom. - Oh, do you have enough room? Wait, she did something to these boobs. She did something to the boobs, dude. Changed it. ... Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no. She did something... She did something to the boobs, dude. - What do you mean? - Oh, fuck. Oh, Sara... Shh, mom, just zip it, please. - Okay, we can... - Because it was big. And she said she was gonna do something. Okay, let's... The whole top looks different. - Oh, wait a minute. - Fuck. [Speaking portuguese] She changed the... she changed the whole thing on my boobs 'cause it was, like, big.

You'll see it tomorrow, not today though. I know. Then we'll see you later, okay? I literally cannot wrap my head around the fact that I'm going to get married tomorrow. It's pretty scary to love someone and to put, you know, all your "eggs in one basket." You know, I would always tell her, if I could just have you sign a contract that said "that you're never gonna cheat on me, you're never gonna leave me..." [Laughs] "And that we'll always be together, I would feel like, okay, I can do this with you. Like, I'll just be with you, and not be afraid," you know? And so when she asked me to ma... - And it turns out you can. - [Laughs] It's called a marriage license. I love you. - Do you love me? - Yeah. Hell yeah.

[Phone line rings] There's a lot of traffic. Are you guys coming straight here? - Yeah. - Okay. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, except there's like, less than two hours left, and no one is here on my side to, like, do my hair or do my makeup. My mom's late, my maid of honor, which is my cousin, is late. All my friends are late. Everyone's late, and I'm just fuckin' sitting here by myself. So this is the most important day of my life, and I'm just standing here alone. You know, I wish that I had my family and friends there to... to... to feel support from them. Fussing over what was happening with my sister, everyone was there, everyone was doing everything. And it just goes to show, like, the lack of importance, I think, in my big day versus my sister's. What's wrong? What's wrong with you? Nothing, I have an hour and a half, and there's nobody here, I haven't started my hair or my makeup, I'm just stressed. Dude, we're gonna get it done.
