 It's like, where do you even begin? What... what do you get first? What do you order first? What do you do? We don't know anything. We gotta take five pounds out. Take that vest out and wear it. Put this on? Put it on. Just do it. I hate the way you're talking to me right now. I feel like everything is happening really quick, and I'm, like, trying to take things slow. Do you think it's too soon for me to, like, hop a plane? No, come out. I just got off the phone with Lauren. - Yeah? - She wants to come out. Do you think that's scary and weird? Where the fuck is Somer? - You're, like, an hour late. - Don't worry about it. If my shit breaks because of your tour, I want help. I'm not giving you a hard time. I'm just trying to get you to understand that I'm in the exact same boat as you. I don't know why you have to be such a bitch all the time. I'm not a bitch. She's done. I'm fucking done with her. We should just not wait for Somer? - Nope. - We're gonna leave her? Yep. Outta here. It's becoming blatantly apparent that she cannot fulfill this role in the band. It's true. synced and corrected by chamallow www.addic7ed.com So, tomorrow I am taking a red-eye to New York. - Of course you are. - I was gonna say, you guys are gonna go steady. Like, you guys are going steady. - You're going to New York. - Till Friday. You better not be moving to fucking New York. - Stop it. No, no, no. - Stop it. - No. - You stop it. I'm starting to feel some strong feelings for Kiyomi, and I cannot wait to see her. I think we have a lot of things to do. Hopefully it ends up, like, not being too much time. Why, you think you'll get sick of her? - No. - Are you staying with her? You're totally gonna be there the whole time. I'm not gonna, like, overstay my welcome at all. Yeah. Stop it! No, we're not. - Okay. - Don't even joke about that. It's been, like, a week of hanging out. - Don't be ridiculous. - Exactly. Sexy lesbians. It's pretty serious, just sayin'. I know, but I don't wanna make it that way. There's not much that you can do to un-serious the situation. - It's already serious. - "Un-serious the situation." - You can't un-serious. - No, that shit's serious. - That shit is, like, surr-ious. - That shit is surr-ious. It's, like, serious. I feel like Kiyomi has Lauren in the palm of her hand, right here... doo-da-doo-da-doo, just hanging out. You gotta keep 'em guessing, you know? Give them a little taste. We gave each other a little taste for three years before we chomped. And look at us now. We're a month away from walking down the aisle. We'll check back to you in a week and see if you're planning on having a bi-coastal relationship, or if she's moving here. 'Cause I'm gonna go ahead and put bets on - she's gonna be moving here. - Yeah. - Shut up. - I want another drink. - Enough love-y talk. - Enough... there's never enough love-y talk, apparently. Somer? I haven't seen her. I thought she was with you guys. - No, she's coming. - Oh, okay. So, we're all gonna get together at noon. And Kiyomi's gonna be the one that's gonna open the conversation, I think. Laura and I have decided that we're gonna let Somer go tomorrow. The band is really moving at a rapid pace. And as soon as the record is out, we're gonna be really busy. And we don't have time to slow down for someone who is sort of wishy-washy about where they wanna be with their role in the band. We're just gonna focus on the fact that it's not the right fit. It's not the right fit. - I know. - And that's it. But so, basically this is like an ultimatum, like... - It's not right. - It's just... it's just... You've already said yourself, though, - that you feel the same way. - I do. But when I spoke to you, you said that you were gonna keep the options open if she is interested, if she does wanna change things. I said, "we let her talk." Definitely. But... But there's no changing our minds? At the end of the day, there's too many issues right now with Somer and the band on an emotional level. And I definitely don't want this weighing on me when Lauren comes to visit. It's not easy finding band members. - It's not. - It's not. And we're lucky that we have us three. Also, it's not easy being a Valentine. It's not easy being a Valentine. Are you gonna be late tomorrow? For what? What are we meeting about? I thought we were recording shit. Vero's house. No, what are we meeting about? Everything that's coming up. I'm not nervous about telling Somer about it not working out. I'm more, like, sad about it. If she freaks out, then she freaks out. There's nothing that I can do. But the only thing that I'm really nervous about is our friendship. And I hope that, um, we can get through this and... and maintain that. Even though we haven't talked in a long time, since we got in that fight in Austin, our friendship has been really good. It's but it's been, like, that has been hanging over me. I just... I know that. You know what? This isn't, like, the best place to have this conversation. I will, like, have a drink with you tonight and it's fine, but, like... Who's that? - Hello? - Hello. I'm walking in. Hi, Lucy. - How are you? - I'm good. - How are you? - Great. Hi, sweetie. What's up? I'm gonna start working with Dusty this week practicing for the music video for the song I just recorded, "Oh la la". This is my first music video, and it is a really big deal. I mean, I have never done one before. It's, like, me and Dusty performing the song and, like, putting it out there. Do you wanna do "Oh la la" first, - and then we'll write? - Yeah. - You wanna do that? - Yeah. ♪ we work hard every day of the week ♪ ♪ and when the weekend comes ♪ ♪ it's time to be free ♪ ♪ music's playing ♪ ♪ everybody's sayin' ♪ ♪ sayin' oh la la la ♪ ♪ oh la la la ♪ ♪ bass is pumpin' ♪ ♪ everybody's jumpin' ♪ ♪ sayin' oh la la la ♪ ♪ oh la la la ♪ ♪ oh la la la ♪ Easy. - It's so low. - No, that's all good. But I like that the song that you're doing with me is a little higher. It is, it's different. I have show my voice more than in that one, you know? - You wanna try that one? - Yeah. I love music. I love making songs. I like performing. I love being onstage. So, I would just love to be able to sing and get paid to do it. However that is, I don't care. What's the first part that I sing again on the first one? You say, uh... you say... ♪ all I had was myself to give ♪ ♪ I'm tired of the drama ♪ ♪ I'm tired of the way we live ♪ ♪ I just wanna be alive tonight ♪ So you're gonna come back... - you're gonna come back in. - I know. So there it's like, what do... - what do you wanna say? - I don't know. It's inspirational for people and for you, so... It's a great team, because Dusty is an amazing songwriter who's very talented. I want to sing. I can't write a song to save life. But guess what? I have a really great following, and I have a lot of publicity. So I can sing on your song. You give me a song to sing and I give you people that will listen to it. - Wanna try it? - Yeah. It's gonna be hot. ♪ I've got something to die for ♪ ♪ if you want me, babe ♪ ♪ I've got it all ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be alone tonight ♪ Oh. Yeah, right there, just... ♪ I don't wanna be alone toni-i-ight ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be alone toni-ight ♪ Or that. It's not a bad start. - No, right? - Right. - It's not. - No. - It's good. - It's really good. Music is a part of her like it is for me, so when we get together, it just is, like, a constant rolling thing. It's like, songs come out. We sing, we mix, we play. And for someone that hasn't been in a studio before, like, she can do anything already. So that's just so much fun, you know, to play with. All right. Bye. Bye. Drive safe. Okay. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - Hello. - Hi. Hi. So it's been a while. It's been a long time. - Good steps. - We've come a long way since we last saw you, that's for sure. Joyce has kind of been with us through this whole grieving process. And I really don't know how I would've made it through without her. Um, and so now that we've inseminated, I'm having a lot of just mixed feelings and emotions. I don't know where my head's at. I think it's a good time to check in and maybe have her calm me down a little bit. Seeing, you know, pregnant people... my Facebook, seeing everybody pregnant and all that, that's hard. - Mm-hmm, brings up a lot... - Yeah. - All the feelings. - Yeah, and it... it brings, like, this ugliness. - Like, it makes me jealous. - Mm-hmm. And I think that's... I'm struggling with that, because I'm mad at myself for being jealous. I should be happy for these lucky women, you know? But, I'm jealous. That's hard. Well, you know what? Jealousy really is anger. I mean, it brings up your anger that this can't be you. And so what you're talking about is normal. It's a feeling you have to have, just like your sadness. I try to distract myself a lot, but the anger comes. So angry at my body. Of all the things that could be wrong with me, why this? The one thing that I want more than anything in this world. And so one of the things I definitely wanted to check in with is we're coming up on our original due date. Like, as it gets closer, all I can do is just... picture, you know, my stomach and, you know... - Yeah. - How big she would be. And I just think about everything that should be - that isn't right now... - Yes, yes. - And it's hard. - Yes, it is. I mean, is that unhealthy? I don't know what else to do. No, that's normal. That's natural. I mean, that's what you go through, is you think about, "where would I be right now? What would be happening?" And so it's not unhealthy. It's actually really healthy to just have your feelings, whatever they are. And then it's thinking about how you want to acknowledge that day, how you want to acknowledge your baby. Are you excited for next week? What's happening next week? Our show. Oh, our show, yes. - Hi. - Hey. - What's up? - What's up, girl? Well, Somer came before you. - Whoa. - You guys are late... - Thanks, Vero. - To your own meeting. To your own meeting. The first thing to talk about that's the most obvious thing, and the elephant in the room, is that, you know, we decided that we were gonna make a decision whether you were gonna commit to the band, or whether the band was gonna commit to you. What the right thing to do was after the tour. At this point, um, we... I... we're feeling like it might not be the right fit because of all the things that we have gone through. And I'm hoping that we can, like, figure this out in the most respectful and positive way. I'm hoping, and I think the band is hoping, that we can carry out some kind of relationship in the future... of course friendship. - I mean, I hope. - Right, right. - Um... - Well, that was first, so... But at this point in Hunter Valentine, like, there is no room to slow down. Eight years in the making and, like, it's just gotta keep going full force. - Totally, totally. - And I hope that... And I don't think you wanna slow that down by my indecision or my, like, inability to be on tour. Yeah, and I was hoping that you could, like, see that and respect that. And, you know, I think that we're all mature and smart enough to, like, see the bigger picture. Right. It's not only disappointing and frustrating, but a little bit heartbreaking. It felt a little bit like an ambush. And I wish we could've had more of a conversation, and maybe we could've tried to see what we could fix, and then move forward and maybe still be able to do something awesome together as a band. I mean, I would love to finish the record with you guys. I don't know how you feel about that. That's what we agreed to. Yeah, I think, um, you know, we all put in time and, like, creativity. And, you know, I feel part of it, 'cause I helped. Actually I'm really happy you said that, 'cause we want you to record this record. You are a part of this record. She's my really good friend, and I wish that we could work together. I saw in her eyes that she looked a little disappointed. I don't know, I feel... I feel kind of sad. Don't you feel like I shouldn't wear this until we get our wedding? I think you're fine wearing it. - Babe... - I like seeing it - on your finger. - I'm just saying, I'm looking at it right now and I'm just... and we're talking about the wedding. And I'm just wondering if should take it off, - being that... you know? - No. We haven't had our wedding yet. When we're at the altar, you're gonna take it off and then put it back on standing there? Urt-skurt! You know? So we already had our legal marriage ceremony in Connecticut, but we are a month out from our big Cafornia wedding, and we have a lot of fuckin' things to do. And I'm more of a planner. You know, Sara kind of likes to fly by the seat-of-her-pants a bit. All right, here's the list of things we need to do before the wedding... get addresses, finish rsvp, order invites, dress, outfit for me, food tasting, wedding cake, flowers, photographer, get alcohol, more alcohol, and order favors. And a D.J. We're almost done. We're practically finished. Have we figured out what invitation we wanna use? No, that's very expensive. So, no, we're not using that one then? Okay. I don't know. I mean, we could, but... all right, what are you doing? Baby, I'm getting addresses. All I know is that you're... Baby, trust me, okay? I'm making headway here. I understand you're making headway, except for the fact that all I'm saying is you're hopping from Facebook... sending things, - to color scheme, to... - Yeah, so what? That's how I work. Is there a particular way you'd like me to do it? - Yes, organized. - How is that? - Please tell me. - Cool. - Don't piss me off. - Fuck, babe, what? I am a little stressed once we start thinking and talking about these things. Sometimes I start to get wrapped up and it's a spiral of, like, "I have to do this. I have to do this. I didn't do this." Planning a wedding is exhausting, and we've got tons of work to do. These are two dollars each. Do you like that, or no? Babe? Yes, baby. Baby, we need to have follow-through with some of this stuff. I'm over this. I'm not sure exactly if Sara knows how much there is to do, but I want her to step up to the plate a little bit and, you know, take the reins. I'm just saying. Sara can be very focused at some things. This isn't one of them. So I a little bit frustrated. 'Cause we need to technically send out invites, like, today. Yeah? Cheers to happy endings, I guess. That's a good cheers. Well, do you think that you'll still be able to be friends? I think we need, like, heart-to-hearts, honestly. I just think it's good to talk about it. It's good to, like, air it all out and talk about what happened and... With Hunter Valentine, it was the taste of what it could mean to be a professional musician. I mean, that was the dream. So, yeah, part of that, like, it felt like got... got sort of crushed, um, not being part of the band anymore. Maybe we could revisit the whole having babies thing. I wanna have kids with you. Don't think that I don't. I'm just... it's gonna... it's planning and being in a better position and... Somer is the type of person that lives every day and every moment day-by-day. And she also feels really comfortable in her lifestyle as it is right now. I think she's afraid of having kids because she thinks that it'll infringe on her music career. But, you know, you have to bite the bullet, and you gotta say, "this is the time." Especially when you're in your upper-thirties. How are we gonna afford a baby? Not even just afford a baby. It's not like I can just knock you up and then we can have a baby, you know? I know, but when are we ever gonna be in position where we're like, "oh, we're totally ready"? When I'm 50? I mean, it's not gonna happen then. No, I know. You know, I know Donna is ready to have kids and start a family pretty much immediately. It's hard, because I... I wanna give music a shot. So I guess it makes me nervous to know that, like, she's ready and she wants it now. And, like, I'm not. Because I'm like, "just give me... just give me a little bit more time." But I don't Wanamaker the most important* person in my life unhappy. It's like, we're getting closer to the point where there has to be a plan. - I'm home. - Hey, sweetheart. Hi, baby. - I missed you. - You're cute. You're all red and cheerful. Like Christmas? Yeah. - I miss you. - I keep having these headaches. I don't know why. Did you have nightmares again last night? - Nightmares. - You did? - Nightmares. - Again? Yeah, I always have the nightmares. - Why? - I don't know. You woke up this morning again, and you were like... It was a bad one too. What'd you have a nightmare about? I won't repeat it. It's my own... you've had a nightmare two nights in a row, baby. You have these dreams, and you wake up and I know something bad happened. And then you wake up and you think it really happened. I really honestly think I have premonitions. I had a dream about Jay, and Romi going back with Jay. That happened. I had a dream that Romi was starting making music with Dusty. That happened. What are you having nightmares about? I have nightmares about you, crazy. About Dusty, huh? 'Cause you're so crazy all the time. Huh. I did, didn't I? I left you for Dusty. Yeah, you did. It's not real. I don't know if they're dreams or if they're premonitions. You and your fuckin' premonitions. 'Cause I've been having a lot of premonitions lately. What'd I do? You said, "I can't hold these feelings back for a man." "It's who I really am, Kelsey. I'm sorry I've been stringing you along." That's what the dream was. And I said, "you're just like that other bitch I dated." It was a bad fucking dream. Kelsey's a little bit sensitive to the penis right now with my ex-boyfriend being in my life. I'm taking on a whole new career, and I'm jumping into it, like, 100%, and that does leave girlfriend in the back. Maybe if we go to bed with me, like, playing with you, your brain will go there. And then you'll have wet dreams. That'd be nicer than nightmares. Wouldn't that be better than the ones you're having? Yes. I'm not too comfortable with Romi making music with her ex-boyfriend. You know, I thought it'd be, like, a small thing. He comes in and helps her. You know, it's turning into a huge project. But I have to make my girlfriend happy and support her, and that's what it is. Aw, baby, I love you. Premonitions, honey, premonitions. Be careful what you do in my dreams. This is cool. Thank you. Right here, stop. Stop. Thank you. I had trouble staying away from Kiyomi. I have intense feelings, and I wanna spend as much time with her as possible. It's kind of a bummer that Amanda went back to L.A. Apparently, her ex and her aren't really getting along. But I'm here to see Kiyomi. - Hi. - Hi. Come in. - Good to see you. - Mm-hmm. I'm actually okay. I slept the whole time. Oh, no, so you're awake right now? - Why, you're tired? - Yeah. I'm just nervous about Lauren coming because I really want it to work out, and I hope that we have the same chemistry that we had at Dinah Shore. And, you know, it's like Dinah Shore could be comparable to, like, a summer camp romance. And so, you know, summer camp romances, you don't bring those things back to the city. So I hope that it's not that kind of scenario. My room is really small. It's mostly bed. All bed. Yes, you can. I didn't wanna wait, like, a whole fucking month. It's too long. Yeah. - Really? - No. Are you extremely tired? - No. - You're not? This is really comfortable. Today marks the day that Charlie was supposed to be born. And, uh, there is no real way you can prepare to get through a day like this. But when we wanted her, we grabbed all of our friends, and dragged them to the beach, and threw flowers into the ocean. Focus as hard as you can on getting a soul that's out there somewhere, whatever you believe in, into Cori's uterus. And I just thought that it was fitting that Cori and I go and do the same thing to say good-bye. I love you. I love you too. It's just not right. We should be with our baby today. You wanna bring the flowers? I'm gonna write her name. Charlie girl, we miss you so much. We think about you every day. Hello. - Hey, baby. - Hi, honey. Hiya, sweetie. Thank you for inviting me to a dinner in your house. - Love you, Ro. - What is that? - I got my toes done. - My baby. I'm letting 'em dry. Andy? Go say hi to Andy. Can I have a hug? Oh, good to see you. - I know, Ro-Ro. - Hi. Hey, what's up, sweetie?? - You look great. - Thank you. I'm gonna have dinner with my family tonight and see my little brother, and my aunt, and my mom, and Peter. And it's just good for me to check in with them, because I've been working nonstop with Dusty on all the music. And this is just a nice break from everything. - So is Ro-Ro gonna be a singer? - Yeah. - Is she gonna say bye-bye-bye? - No. You may have to come onstage with me. - I will come. - Will you? - Yeah. - That's a workout, huh? Uh-huh. Roro needs to start working out. - Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. - Huh? Honey, did you see the salmon? - I gotta get my endurance up. - Yeah. I have two special needs brothers. My dad was in Vietnam and he was sprayed with agent orange. So, it was really weird that I had two brothers that had the disabilities that they did and, you know, I didn't. And so, growing up, you know, they did a little bit of research trying to figure out why both boys were affected and why I wasn't. And then they found out that it was caused from the agent orange. And it did directly affect my father and his sperm and something with the male chromosome. - Andy, you look so handsome. - Thank you. I tell you, I haven't seen you in awhile. And you look thin and you look handsome. It's just rare that we all get to get together or get Andy down from my grandma's house and just, like, have a family dinner. Like, there's a lot going on in life, and sometimes it's, like, the most centered place to just be with your family. - If Ro-Ro makes it big... - Yeah. Tell Ro-Ro, "you take care of me, Ro-Ro." Am I gonna take care of you if I make it famous? Uh-huh. Am I gonna take care of mom and Peter? - Yeah. - What am I gonna get mom and Peter and Aunt Mary when I become famous? Oh, you're all getting something. We all better say our prayers. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. The reason that I work so hard and do all of the things that I do is so that I can support my family. I wanna take care of my mom. I wanna be able to give her a vacation and take my brothers on vacation. My mom doesn't have a lot of money... and, like, spoil her in a way. She takes such good care of all of us. I am the one that is capable of making something of myself. My brothers don't have the opportunity that I have, and I take advantage of that. I don't take it for granted that I'm capable of working. We gotta get, like, a nice, big family house so that everyone... whenever we go homeless, has one. Just one big, nice one that's like, "oh, you need that? You need that?" Are you over mommy and aunt Mary and me talking? - No. - He's okay. It's too much for you? - Are you just listening? - Yeah. I love you. You are? Periodical, right now. Amanda is done with her ex, so I invited her out to, you know, kind of take her mind off of things. Lauren's out of town, so she deserves to have some fun. So I have to talk to you guys about something. Oh, what is it? Sara. Spill the beans. Well, have you guys, like, picked a designer yet for your outfits, for the clothes? No, I haven't at all. I have no... I have not even skimmed the surface. 'Cause I have a proposition for you guys. All right. What is it? All right. So I am doing a runway show for a designer based in L.A. He came up with the idea that maybe we would design your wedding outfits. I'm not, like, a designer in any way. - But I'm... - Yeah. really good with fashion and... all that jazz... Yeah, I'm down. And I would love to be involved and help. - So you guys into it? - Yeah, for sure. - Definitely into it. - Yeah, let's... I mean, I'm not gonna say yes. - Cheers. - Cheers. I'm open to her at least showing me what she has to design. I'm curious. I mean, fuck, it takes something off my plate. If I shotgun a... online, you can actually do this now, where you can marry somebody online if you get your license. And there's a website where you can fill out - an online questionnaire. - There is a website. I could do it. If I wear a priest costume, could I marry you guys? So what, you're gonna design our outfits, marry us, and actually, you're the bride now. I'm no longer... you're taking over. - Your dreams have come true! - No. - And you're on a TV show! - Shut up. It's frustrating to me that Amanda keeps trying to find a way to involve herself in the wedding. This wedding is really important to both Whitney and I, and it has nothing to do with her. It really... it's none of her business. And Amanda is bothering the shit out of me. And I would be totally serious about it. - Literally. - Come here. Literally sarcastic. I'd rather you not do it, but you can still wear a suit. You can wear a priest outfit. What? I said a joke. There's no way I would totally be serious. Sometimes with Sara, a little switch goes off and her mood drastically shifts. And that's pretty much what has happened, and now I have to figure out what exactly is bothering her. She's in a mood. I'm not about to run out and get my marriage license... Oh, yeah, good. - If she's not down for it. - Yeah. Whitney and Sara are so crazy right now. It's, like, hard to even be around them 'cause they're so, like, freaking out about the wedding. What is wrong with you, dude? Who's our... do not grab me. - Listen, I'm just saying... - "Do not grab me?" What the fuck is wrong with you, dude? - Can I state my opinion? - Sure, but, like... Okay, that's what I'm doing. How am I on one though? All night, you're, like, in a zone, dude. No, I'm just telling you how I feel. No, you're, like, super anti-me, antisocial and, like, in the zone. Antisocial? 'Cause last I checked, - I've been talking to people. - Okay, not me, who is your fuckin' wife. Yeah, well, you have not once come up to me - and tried to talk to me. - Do you wanna stay here - for a little bit? - No, just hold on one second. Just hang on one second. Let's go, everyone. Let's go, come on. - What is wrong with you, girl? - Let's go! - You can go, Sara. - Taxi, taxi. - I'll stay. You can go. - Oh, stop. No, she can go fuck herself. Seriously. No, seriously. Whitney. I like this place. - Guess what. - What? This is our first date. I mean, we've had meals together. - This is like a date. - But this is, like, just you and me... Date. Um... so this is your favorite place? Yeah, I hope you like it. Aw. I really like Lauren. But we're both just still trying to get to know each other. I'm not sure that I'm, like, able to have a relationship at this point. But I do see something different in Lauren... That could make me consider changing my ways. - So my meeting... - Oh, yeah. w as, like, surprisingly, really good. Somer was the one that was like, "yeah, I... you know, I'd really like to finish the record with you guys." Yeah. I just think she is still battling whether she can tour because she has to leave her wife, who she just got married to. Mm-hmm. You don't want someone that doesn't wanna tour. Do you know how much we tour? Mm-hmm. Why? I was just wondering. I think our touring schedule definitely means that we're not gonna see each other as much as we would like, and I'm not sure that Lauren actually realizes that yet. But that's always gonna be a problem in my life if I wanna have a relationship. There's always gonna be that distance, and it's always gonna be hard. When are we gonna see each other again? I don't know. Have you thought about that? I don't know. As soon as possible. Like, two weeks ago, we were sitting in a bar being like, "I'm never gonna talk to anybody that I like." I know. It's ridiculous how quickly things change. Ridiculous. I just was really set in my ways. Are you a changed woman? I don't know. I... right now, I feel like it, to be honest. But then again, we're gonna be separated for a while, so... I mean, I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna say I'm, like, gonna revert back to old ways, but I'm, like, I don't know what you're gonna be doing. So... I just don't want it to, like, bite us in the ass, whatever we do, you know? Mm-hmm. I wanna make the right decision. I have been taking tests every morning. And, you know, I kept getting negatives. But I had one test left this morning, so I said, "what the hell?" Oh, my God. Kacy. What? I was so sure I wasn't. - Why were we sad? - I know nothing. - I have no intuition. - We were sad all weekend. I was so depressed. That says fucking pregnant. We're pregnant. Holy shit! I can't fuckin' believe it. This is awesome. We're really, really happy. And really in shock. And scared. Happy. Excited. We have a lot of doctor's appointments. How many months has it been? Since we lost Charlie? Yeah, I know. There's somebody. Hello. Why didn't you just tell us you were in there? Mmm. - That's my kid in there. - Mm-hmm. I don't know. Well, like, I didn't want to go hang out with Amanda last night at all. You know? It's like, I... we have our own shit going on. And like, as soon as she gets there, I'm already irritated by her. Already. Well, you were already irritated by me as well. I don't need her to be involved in my wedding as much as she thinks she needs to be, you know? Amanda inserting herself was kind of the tipping point, but it wasn't the real root cause. I think right now we're going through a bunch of anxiety and stress, and all the planning, and life in general. It's just a lot. We're having a lack of communication. That's for sure. Or miscommunication, or bad communication. I feel like you've been, like, on edge and argumentative, you know? And I don't want us to be like this. This doesn't seem like the way - to start something, you know? - No, I know. A wedding, like, we're supposed to be happy, and, like, feeling good about life and what we're doing. And I'm just... I feel, like, stressed out. I feel... instead of, like, being, like, a team, that's what we need to become more of. And it's, like, with so much going on in our lives right now, and so much, like, planning to do and... we're exhausted anyway. And, like, working on a relationship is tiring too. But, like, it's obviously a priority. - Right? - Of course. In the past, our communication wasn't right. It would be like, "well, fuck you. I'm leaving now. Bye. See you later." You know, but we're married now, and we have to compromise and forgive and forget and open up lines of communication and really find a way to make it work between us. I just want it to be good. I want us to be happy. I want it to be a fairy tale, you know? Like, I do. I know, so do I. But, you know, we both are fuckin' not perfect at all. But nobody is. And let's deal with our fuckin' issues together. You know? Come here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I love you so much. I love you too. And I wanna work on us so we can be good, and... I just know that there's no one else in the world I'd rather be with. I feel like my hair's all crazy in the back here. I think it's perfect. Dusty and I are shooting my video today for "Oh la la la". - Let's go. - Let's do this. I'm really excited about it. I would never think that I'd be sitting here doing a music video with him... ever. What, Dusty? ♪ we work hard every day ♪ ♪ of the week ♪ ♪ and when the weekend comes ♪ ♪ it's time to be free ♪ The video's going great. Like, we got onstage, and me and Dusty are performing the song. We're definitely flirting, and I was just really trying to use that as, like, this creative drive for the two of us, and it's probably the happiest I've been in a very long time with anything I've ever done. ♪ Music's playin' ♪ ♪ everybody's sayin' ♪ ♪ sayin' oh la la la ♪ ♪ oh la la la ♪ ♪ la la la la ♪ ♪ la la la la ♪ ♪ la la la la ♪ ♪ oh la la la ♪ Cut. We're gonna set up for awhile, so take a break. Go have a cigarette real quick. Yeah. Are you? Mm-mmm. - Good job. - Thank you. Thank you, babe. Hi, baby. - Your hair looks cute. - Thanks. Carla did it all crazy. I show up at the video set, and I see Dusty and Romi and people around. So I'm excited for it. I hadn't really heard from Romi all morning, "cause I guess she's pretty busy." But now that I'm here, I'm excited to support Romi and be there for her, and just see what they've been working on. - Goodness. - Right? This looks like a good production. Are you okay to hang and just get through all this? Yeah, yeah, of course. Are you? So Rose, the one in there, - is, like, my closest friend. - Mm-hmm. And she's the one who, like, handles, like, all my business stuff and, like, put this together and has, like, a night here. - Yeah. - Hey. Hi, honey. It's gonna be a little bit of sitting around. Yeah. Where's your girlfriend? At home. Here I am to see Romi. I go out there, and I'm like, "hey." And she... it was almost like I'm walking in on a conversation that I wasn't supposed to, or just that, like, I wasn't welcome to that conversation. I was like, "whoa, this is weird." Like, I'm not gonna come up to my girlfriend and feel like I can't talk to my girlfriend. Like, I'm in a weird situation. - We're gonna get food. - Oh, yeah. - And then we're gonna go. - Oh, yeah, it's all good. I'm probably just gonna run outside and... Smoke. 'Cause this is... do you know what the schedule is? This is it, last scene. - This is the last one? - Mm-hmm. So I'm gonna walk through, watch the couple making out, wrap it up. We just cleaned up. And then we're gonna go next door and get some food. Okay, perfect. - That works? - Yeah. Yeah. I have a very good sense of, like, what's right and what's wrong, and her behavior with him isn't okay. Dusty, just perform with Romi, no big deal. All right, touch each other inappropriately while you work. And, like, if I'm your girlfriend and I'm with you, like, have some fucking respect. - Huh? - Yes, "huh." - Nothing's wrong. - You sure? Mm-hmm. Okay. 'Cause it's, like, not why... Like... like you're mad. I don't wanna feel like I'm held back on how I'm supposed to act because... you know what I mean? Act however you wanna act. She's not happy with the energy that's going on with me and Dusty. She's pissed off. And I don't have time for it. I don't have time for it right now. I have things I have to do. I have... I can't do this right now. If you're gonna do this today, I'm gonna ask you to leave. - I am. - All right, I'm going. No, I don't want you to, Kels. - No, I wanna leave. - I don't want you to. I just... oh, my God. Can you stop? Come here. Just honestly, I don't really feel too close to you right now. I see the way you guys interact. I don't like it, and I don't want to be around it. Don't go there. Talk to me. You have to talk to me instead of making little comments like you do. And it isn't fun when I'm trying to, like, have fun and make a video. Okay, well, make your video, but I don't want to sit around on set. Like, I don't like the way you guys interact with each other. This is my day, and I'm not... I know Kelsey does the, "Romi, Romi, Romi, I need. I need. I need. And Romi's so selfish." You know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But yeah, today is my day. I am shooting a video that is about me. So, just step back and let have it today. Step out of yourself. Step out of your issues. Step out of your insecurity. And just see that the girl that you say you love is doing something that she's dreamed about doing her entire life, and it's happening. Why can't you say something like, "hey, how was the shoot today, babe?" - No. - "How's it going?" Did you guys do good?" Nothing positive. I totally did that when I walked in. You don't... you didn't listen to me at all, did you? No. This is just stupid. I don't even wanna be here. Yeah, because... I mean it would have been, like... I wouldn't even have been able to talk to you. Do you know what I mean? I almost felt like it was like, I had to be, like, not... - I don't wanna feel like that. - Yeah. - I'm working with you. - We're shooting - a video together. - Yeah, we're doing a video. We just... like, I can't be like... because she's standing there going... I know. We look great. It's fun. It'll be okay. It's nice in the sun. It's perfect. - Sunset time. - I know. Magic hour. Um, I wanted to talk to you... about something really serious. - Yeah? - Don't get nervous. What are you talking about? What? I guess, um, uh... I wanted to ask you if you think it's, like, an okay idea, or if you want to, like, just see each other. - Yeah. - Okay. That's what I wanted to ask you. I think you're an amazing person, and I think I wanna be with you, you know? I wanna... I wanna be with you too. There's a lot of obstacles that could be facing Lauren and I in the future, but fuck it. Right now, I'm not trying to over-think anything, and I'm just trying to go with the flow and not set these boundaries around my feelings, because that's what I've done in the past. She makes me feel okay to, like, move forward and commit. You know? We'll make it happen. No promises. Seriously. It doesn't make you nervous to, like, just be seeing one person? No. I really like you, so it doesn't make me nervous. I guess... are you my girlfriend? - Yes. - You... you are? You're making me blush. Yeah, I think we both gave in. We threw the bachelor towel in. You did, right? - You burned yours? - Yeah. - Okay. - I burned my bachelor towel. - Me too. - She burned her... - Hung up the cap. And, yeah, you're my girlfriend. I get home from the video shoot, and I'm hurt that she brought that energy to the set, and that she just turned the entire day into something that it didn't need to be. You can't text me back? I didn't get a text. What did you text me? I've been texting you. You said you weren't coming home tonight. And you have no desire to write me back? Kelsey, I text you earlier and you said, "I'm moving out. You're choosing money over... " what... what money am I choosing? What are you talking about, Romi? You haven't even tried to contact me at all. You said, "go make money, Ro... " I called you and said, "come over, let's talk." Are you reading your bbms? - Oh, my God. - What is wrong with you? Do you not see at all the way you act with him? - I do. - And you're okay with that? This is a friend that I have known for over... almost 6 1/2 years now. Romi, the thing is, he's not just a friend. He's your ex-boyfriend. He is my ex-boyfriend. And you keep referring to him as your ex-boyfriend. He's my ex-boyfriend. He's my ex-boyfriend. And the way you act with him isn't okay. We know each other! He's not a stranger in my life. Out of all those people in L.A. to make music with, you choose to work with your ex-boyfriend? It happened to end up that way. Romi choosing to make pop music with her ex-boyfriend, it's so completely fucking insane. And maybe the Kelsey a year ago would've been fine with it, would've sat back, or would've just let Romi do whatever she had to do. But I grew up a lot in a year, in two years, and to the point where I have too much respect for myself to sit back and watch someone mistreat me like that. Can you not be even happy that this is working for me? I was happy. I was happy you were making music. - When? When? - First time I met Dusty. - I was totally fine with him. - First night. Then you've had time with him, and you've been with him, and you've been alone with him. And I come into it and I see the way you are with him. You haven't liked that I've been working with Dusty once this week. Why can't you just admit it? - Are you just gonna blame me? - I do admit it. I admit it full-heartedly, because I don't like the way you act with him. Maybe if you treated him like a friend and not something more than that. How do I not treat him like a friend? I treat him the way I treat Drew and Rose and everybody else! I'm affectionate with my friends. It's because it's him. - We're close. - And that's the whole thing, that you just don't obviously see. You don't obviously see that I am trying to do something amazing right now that I'm so excited about, that is absolutely one of the most exciting things I've ever wanted to do with somebody I'm so excited to do it with. - You don't see anything... - Yes, I do see all that. - From where I'm coming from. - No, you don't! You haven't said congratulations. You have... nothing, all fucking week! And why do you think that is? - Because you don't like it. - I don't. Guess what, your girlfriend is really excited about something. I wanna make music with him. I want to! Okay, then make music with him. What is it that you want me to say? - I don't get it. - You know what? If I was making music with my ex-lover, ex-girlfriend, and I was flirting with them, and I had this energy with them, and it was so great, and we needed to be onstage, you wouldn't have a problem with it? So what, this is... Would you be okay with me doing that? - No. - There's your answer. Did you ever think maybe you fell back in love with him? Did you ever think about that? When you open that door, that's what happens. And when you're in a relationship, you don't do things like that. You just don't. I would never do that to you. I've always been a sucker for Romi because I've been in love with Romi, and you do crazy fuckin' shit when you are in love. Love will get you somewhere where you're hurt, and you're abandoned, and, um, you think someone's your best friend, but really you were just a fuckin' filler. You're gonna lose me. How does that make you feel? Honestly, have you even thought about it once? Yeah, no, I don't comprehend it yet. Let's just talk in a few days. Why don't we just breathe? Bye. I love you! Kels! I don't know what you want me to say right now. I love you. I don't know what to say. Why does it have to be so dramatic? I'm tired. I'm gonna be moving my things out. I'm gonna find somewhere to live. And it's done. We're not together anymore. That's it. - I want you to know that. - Okay. You know, I'm gonna start working with Dusty. I'm gonna start traveling with Dusty. I'm gonna start spending every day in the studio with Dusty. It's about to happen. Dusty and I have something really strong happening that I can't control anymore. And I don't want to. Hey. synced and corrected by chamallow www.addic7ed.com www.tvsubtitles.net
