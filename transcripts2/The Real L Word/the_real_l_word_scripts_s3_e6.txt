 The Real L Word (2010–2012): Season 3, Episode 6 - Lost in a Bush - full transcript 
 The Dinah fever continues its hold on the women of The Real L Word. While Cori and Kacy are overwhelmed with the weekend-long party, Whitney and Sara take the heat from the pool party into the bedroom? and bring another person with them. Meanwhile, Amanda?s idea of a single girls? weekend has rapidly transformed into her best friend ?wifing up? with Dinah?s resident rock star. Anyone who?s anyone at Dinah is at the White Party, which means Romi finds herself in another uncomfortable position with her ex-friends. The drama from the weekend carries over to The Real L Word publicity photo shoot where Lauren finds herself stuck in the middle of her best friend and her punk rock fling. Romi?s failed attempt at keeping her distance from the cool kids brings one thing: a breakdown. Feelings of guilt cause Sara to confront her once best friend and confidante. Will they repair their broken friendship?

 Previously on The Real L Word...  Whoo! Okay, so let's make some predictions for this trip. Will Lauren finally wipe the dust off of her vagina and get laid? By the end of it, we're gonna need, like, IVs and oxygen masks. And it's like, "where the fuck am I going?" I wanna dip my head underwater. This is Sara and I's third year going together, and hopefully it'll be our first year leaving together. It just seemed like everybody was a little aggro.

 Sara, like, completely ignored me. Sara, I thought, was a real friend. Not only does she not have my back, she has intentions of making sure that I'm hurt. I don't give a shit who you slept with. I don't give a shit who you made out with. This shit's not fuckin' for me. I'm not ready to commit, and I can't give her what she fully needs. Mentally, I am not ready to be with somebody again. Don't get me into any trouble. I see Lauren, and I'm like, "she's very attractive." [Chuckles] I don't like Kiyomi.

 I think she's a cocky, obnoxious asshole. Dude, she's so full of shit...  she totally likes this girl and is being a defensive bitch about it. Are you guys going to Dinah? Shut the fuck up. Jesus, we haven't left the house for how long? And now we're gonna go to Dinah Shore? - I feel old. - It's, like, 3:00 A.M. But it's Dinah.

Uh-huh. [Both laugh] Neither did clothes. I felt out of place with my clothes on. - Mm-hmm. - [Giggles] Are you ready to get grinded on? No. Do you want to go dance first or, like, do some shots? Can I take a picture with you? - One, two, threesome! - Hi, baby. - Thank you. - It's okay. - Really? - Yeah. Uh... it did work. I... I lost her at five months. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Yeah. It's...  It's all right. When a stranger comes up to you and asks, "how's the baby?" What do you say? Like, it's just...  it's hard... it's a hard situation to be in. It was really nice to meet you too. Thank you, and good luck. - Good luck. - Stay strong. - Always. Always. - Thank you so much. ♪ I wish you'd never said it ♪ ♪ some days I regret I said ♪ Let's not talk about it because her and I, like, hanging out, is another...  Well, just so you know, this girl, like, - lives with her girlfriend. - Okay, but how do you...  What's your source of information? I'm curious how you know this. Because I met this... these girls in Williamsburg. - Oh. - And my friend Magda told me. Um... Magda told you. Is she friends with Kiyomi? Yeah, they were just with them the other day. 'Cause we've been texting, like, since I met her. And she said, "oh, that thing's, like, sort of done." - But every girl says that. - Duh. It's not like I'm like, "oh, I believe you." [Laughs] I'm a little confused as to why I'm getting so much shit about this Kiyomi thing because Amanda's been doing anything she wants anyway, so why does she worry about me right now? What am I supposed to say? "So I've heard you're living with some chick." That's so dumb. I think that it's, like, pretty obnoxious if, like... if it's true, yeah. - That's horrible. - You know what I mean? Like, I just...  If she's living with her girlfriend. Not on your part, like, on the...  on... on her part it's obnoxious. But... [Sniffles] - You know. - I'll clear it up, I guess. I don't wanna, like...  I don't know what to say about that. Are you gonna make out with her today? I think she's cool. I dig the girl. - Oh, you dig the girl? - Yeah, she's...  - All right, we'll see...  - She's pretty rad. I'd hit it. [Laughter] No, I wouldn't, but I would watch you. Go. Supporting. Not. But, you know, as a friend, - I'll support whatever...  - "Supporting... not."

[Sighs] I feel it too. It's hard. This is not where we're supposed to be. We will get there. I love you. I love you too. Dinah! Yeah. I wonder if everybody else is having this same conversation - that we're having right now. - Yeah, right. I think we are the biggest debs here. [Laughs] If we're gonna be surrounded by lesbians, people are gonna ask, and.. We're gonna drink through it. That's what we're gonna do. Just got in the mindset like, "okay, this is a question I'm gonna have to answer repeatedly today, so... let's get drunk." Let's not fight it. Let's just try to enjoy the day, enjoy each other, enjoy this experience for what it is. Bottoms up! How's it taste? - A little strong. - Whoo! That is... that is horrible. I'm drunk! Don't let me get naked, okay? [Laughter] Well, when we get back to the room, I can't promise anything. ♪ You got me wrapped up ♪ ♪ in a box with a bow on top ♪ ♪ you got me iced out, lipstick pout ♪ ♪ never let me out ♪ ♪ you got me dolled up, minty fresh ♪ ♪ always look my best ♪ Dinah, it's not normally my, you know, bag of tea or whatever. Cup of tea. Uh, I don't drink tea. But Hunter Valentine was asked to play at Dinah. For me, that makes it worth it. You want this, right, baby? You want it? You want it? We're ready to blow the fuckin' bras off of all the lesbians at the Dinah Shore. Oh! [Laughter] Hey! - Hey! Hi, honey. - You're here. - I love you. - I love you too. Are you okay? Maybe if I didn't hit the stairs to come in...  We were here for literally two seconds. And this... I mean, this couple just came in, and they were like, "oh, how's the baby?" - Ohh. Fuck, man. - "Did you have the baby?" And it was just like...  I'm glad you guys are there, though. - Yeah. - To get your mind off of stuff. Like, honestly. And it's gorgeous. - It's beautiful out. - Yeah. Like you had to go to the date thing, like how did the date thing go? And Whitney and Sara and everyone were watching my face and her face, and I sat there, just going...  "Oh, we just got punk'd." I know they're you're friends, it's just...  the nicest way I can put it is, they're very bully-ish. They're just bullies, man. It's really sad, at that age. Yeah. Be away from it. I'm so happy that Cori and Kacy are here at Dinah because they're normal, and they're my friends, and I love them. And it feels, like, safe to have...  just... a good couple... with us. Yay! Bye. I love you. Good to see you. - I will. - Take care. [Upbeat music] [Indistinct chatter] Ooh. Hello. I think I just got the chills. Oh, my God. Oh, babe, babe. Are you missing out what's happening right now? - What? - She's sucking on my ear. I don't know why I'm sucking on Sara's earlobes, but Dinah fever is in me. Oh, God. Oh, oh. Yep. I came. [Laughs] I can do it to Whitney too. Do it... get her, get her, get her, get her, get her. I might... I might...  Lauren's attractive and sexy. Hey. It's all innocent fun. Huh? Orgy without Amanda. I want you. We love Amanda, and, like, I'm kind of turned on by the thought of you getting it into Amanda. Sorry. That's why I love her. We're confident in one another. There's no jealousy. - It's Dinah. - Dinah! What happens at Dinah stays at Dinah. Sara, Whitney just said...  Whitney just said we're having an orgy. - Hold on. Yes, we are. - Let me... [Upbeat music] [Crowd chatter] How you doin'? - Good. How are you? - Good. - Hi, guys. - How are you? Good. How are you? I'm a couple drinks in. Feelin' a little loose, a little tipsy. - 'Cause I'm like...  - Ohh! This? Oh, my God. Yeah. I'm in it to win it. [Laughs] Let's go. So we'll be here for a little while longer. Can we talk about how much I love Dinah? Let's go! [Alternative music] ♪ ♪ Hunter Valentine was performing, but I have no idea who Hunter Valentine is, and based on the fact that they are friends with Lauren and Whitney and Sara, God knows what they've said about me. So I really don't feel like walking in to watch someone perform that's probably just gonna think I'm this bitch. So I just stayed in my room. Let's just order. Bet we'll order some food. Please give it up. [Cheers and applause] Dinah Shore, ladies! Let me ask you this: Who's doing some things you may regret at Dinah Shore this weekend? Put your motherfuckin' hands in the air! Thank you! All right, ladies. Give it up, drop some fist pumping right now, and get a little rock and roll in you. We have motherfuckin' Hunter Valentine, ladies! Give it up!

Oh, Romi, your boobs are bigger than I thought. I see Kacy's face, and what I see is like sober, supportive wife...  and, "I apologize for this one now." - Aah! - [Laughing] - Oh, yeah. - Watch out. - She's grabbing boobs! - Oh, my God! - She's an animal! - Like, oh, my God! - Whoo! - Aah! [Laughter] She's making you a bottom, baby. - So much for that top dog. - I know. When Cori gets a little tipsy, she has an alter ego. And Romi gets introduced to partial Coco. - Coco at...  - Yeah, I think...  Coco at dusk. Kelsey got bent over, Coco-style. It's happened to all of us. She doesn't really know you unless she's bent you over and smacked you on your ass. [Whispering] So stupid. So you're enjoying your Dinah, crazy girl. Romiaah! - You looked light. - Yeah. For the first time in a long time, you just looked light. I think it was the first time in a long time that I wasn't battling sadness. I just let it all go, had some drinks. Mm. That's good. That's exactly, I think, what you needed. There are some drunk bitches out there. ♪ Hey, I got my drink on ♪ ♪ I'm doing what I please ♪ ♪ tonight we're going big ♪ ♪ as we light up the street ♪ Wait, so tomorrow, you guys don't have any like...  - No. - Shit to play. - You're allowed to like... - No, now, I'm... - You're free. - I'm... about to get...  You're about to get fucked up. Kiyomi just makes me feel good when I'm around her. I like hanging out with her. But it's starting to freak me out that Amanda said Kiyomi's living with this girl in New York. That's not okay. I would never get involved with someone that has a girl back home that she's living with. I just don't wanna...  I don't have a girlfriend. All right, just tell me...  what is the deal with that? Sit down. Okay, so you want me to tell you just like... right like this? Yep. Um, so I... been dating this girl. - Right. - Like, non-monogamous. Like, she did... but she not hap... doesn't like that. My friend was like, "don't do that" " 'cause she has, like, a girlfriend she's living with." - And I'm like, it's not...  - Your friend, you mean Amanda? Yes. Obviously. Uh, we went on... we went to make a record in Canada. So I, like, rented out my apartment. And then there was, like, a week where I came back...  - Yeah. - And I stayed with her. Uh-huh. So if that's living with my girlfriend...  - Oh, I get it. - Then... I'm not a...  I'm not trying to... I'm not a manipulator or a liar. No, no, no. I, like, it's just...  if anything was gonna happen between us, I would not want to do anything if you had a girlfriend, obviously. Maybe we should just be, like, best friends forever. - What do you think? - Totally. Cheers. [Both laugh] Do you want to get, like, matching necklaces? - Yeah. - Okay. I don't know. You wanna go over there for a minute? Stop it. You're bad. - I'm bad? - You're...  "Do you wanna go over there for a minute?" - Really? - I'm serious, yeah. - Where? - I don't know. - Somewhere? - Away. - All right. Yeah, I do. - Okay. Let's go. I feel like I should put on clothes, but...  I don't have any clothes. I'm okay with that. I think it's okay. If we go...  - that way? - Okay. All of a sudden, I, like, turn around, and Lauren and Kiyomi are, like, gone. So either they're fucking in the bathroom, or they're, like, staring at each other's eyes, or they're, like, lost in the bush somewhere. I was like, "all right." So... you go one way, I'll go another, and then we'll just never see each other again. - That sounds great. - Yeah, sounds good, right? - No. - I'm in. No? [Chuckles] No, I'm being honest. It doesn't sound good at all. [Both laughing] [Kissing] [Both laugh] I'm not. It's already done. [Both laughing] Silly goose. What were you doing? Just kissing. On the grass. On the grass? Oh. That's sweet. It was very sweet. So I'm probably just another fuckin' notch on her belt. I don't care. She's a nice girl. [Laughs] Cheers. Dude. What? I can't hang out with that girl anymore. - Why? - Because. I got a crush on her. - That's fine. - No, it's not okay. Why? Because I don't want to like anybody. You can't control what you like. Or who you like. Kiyomi and Lauren just met, and she seems to be really, really happy. She's not like the way she is with Ali. Kiyomi's laughing at a higher pitch. She, you know, always looks in the mirror, but I think she's looking at it, like, five times more. So you know that Kiyomi really likes Lauren. I think it's actually awesome that you have a crush...  on Lauren. I think I'm, like...  I'm, like, ready for me to have a crush on somebody and for somebody to just be like, "fuck." I'm ready to chase some lady around like I'm a fuckin' 12-year-old little boy. Let's just go outside. ♪ I'm underneath the stars, I wonder where you are ♪ - ♪ I wonder where... ♪ - So is she going tonight? - Yeah. - This is the fucking opposite of how I expected Dinah to go. Lauren has been giving me shit about seeing girls and, like, dating them or of anything more than just hooking up with them since I got here. And talking about Dinah and how this is our single girls weekend. And now, all of a sudden, you're gonna go wife up. Like, what? You might get in on that action. Please, I would rather lop off my vagina. So we're getting ready for the White Party. The White Party is the mecca. This is the biggest party at Dinah. Like, if you're going to Dinah, you will be at the White Party. Oh, yeah. Let's see the tighty whities. [Giggles] You look really cute. I look like a fuckin' guy on a Neil Diamond tour. Do you want to wear black pants? - Yeah. - Yeah, I like those better. ♪ Like every heart you've broken ♪ ♪ every heart you've broken ♪ [Indistinct chatter] ♪ Please take my picture ♪ ♪ and make me work it out ♪ ♪ please take my picture ♪ ♪ and make me work it out ♪ ♪ please take my picture ♪ ♪ and make me work it out ♪ ♪ please ♪ that's it, right there. ♪ Take my picture ♪ ♪ ooh ♪ ♪ you keep on flashin' away ♪ This is my first red carpet at Dinah Shore. I put so much time and energy and love and passion into Hunter Valentine, and I think that's a cool part of our job. - Right here, please. - Give me that smile right here. - Look up here. - One more here. Okay, one side here. All the tension from tour and the fighting and everything just sort of dissipated. And we're in palm Springs, and we played this cool show, and we're on the red carpet, getting our picture taken, it's fun when things come together like that as a band, and we're just kind of like, doing these new, exciting things together. Right here, your eyes here. Give me those eyes right here. You guys. What's going on? You guys, this way. Whitney. That way. Oh, lookit. Oh! What do you know? It's like West Side Story. I was... it is like the West Side Story. She's like, "Romi looks really bitchy." That's exactly what I said when we walked past them. I'm like, "that was like the West Side Story." She's a bitch. She's a piece of shit human being. - Really? - Yeah. We walk into the White Party. We have, like, a crew of people with us. And, of course, the first person we see is Romi. I don't want to deal with drama. Like, I don't want to see people that I don't want to normally see in general. Why am I gonna surround myself with people that suck? - She seems really fake. - She's shockingly fake. She's possibly one of the fakest people you'll ever meet. Every time I'm around them, all I'm just praying for is that they just keep on walking. I don't want to be, like, bullied at or attacked. But... I'm always gonna show up, whether they're there or not. I'm gonna hold my head up high.

I'm not jealous of Kiyomi. I just want, like, some time with Lauren that she doesn't have, like, her head up Kiyomi's asshole. Kiyomi, like, swooped in. There's something off about her, and I don't know what it is. But did you... you didn't say that to her. No. [Indistinct chatter] I can't really shake the fact that Amanda accused me of having a girlfriend that I lived with. So I feel like it's important for me to call her out on that in order to clear the air. I can just tell that you are a fucker when you...  I can just tell that you're a dick. We need to just be friends. I'm not gonna cave in to you being a dick. All right, well...  You think that I'm an asshole. Let's just both keep it on an equal, level playing field. Okay? All right. You're already not gonna do it. I can tell. I don't... why? Your eyes. Nobody calls me on my shit. Like, dude, if you do like my friend, I'm the last person you wanna fight with. Like, come on. You do not want me to not like you. It's like... you're not gonna win. Lauren's an adult, and so we can't protect her. She just has to fuckin' figure it out, you know what I mean? I don't know. She seems a little sketchy. She just seems like... this just like...  came out of nowhere. She has this girlfriend, "ex-girlfriend" who the fuck knows what's going on? And all of a sudden, my best friend, who has wanted to play the single card forever, is, like, into this girl who doesn't even have, like, a clean slate. And apparently I've already had an argument with her? I mean, no, I'm not sold on her. - Where are they? - Where are they? They're, like, making out in a corner right now. I know. They're probably...  Let's just go ahead and just go, let's go. I don't know where she is.

[Laughing] Yeah. I knew right away that she was going to steal my heart. Like, immediately. And that's trouble for me. That's trouble for a person who's constantly trying to keep it protected and not give it away to anybody. I know that I have feelings for her already, and it makes me nervous. I'm ready to go...  eat something, you know? [Phone chimes] All right. Carry me. [Laughs] [Phone chimes] Ugh. [Thud] She's gonna be there tomorrow. Ohh... fun times. Ali is flying in to Los Angeles for The Real L Word publicity photo shoot tomorrow. I have a lot of anxiety over the fact that I have to go to this photo shoot knowing that Ali and Lauren are going to be in the same place because I'm not going to be able to hide these feelings for Lauren. ♪ I'm no longer wasting time ♪ ♪ today ♪ ♪ I won't run away ♪ ♪ I played the fool ♪ ♪ I'm over it, honey ♪  ♪ I've been around the game ♪ - Good morning, sunshine. - Good morning.

I feel like it's over. She's so difficult, and she recognizes that she's so difficult. I told her I don't think we're...  either one us are good for each other. That's what I told her. Yeah, I think there should be more closure. This thing with Ali and I eds to officially be done. You know, she's used to us fighting and then getting back together and making up. And I know in my heart that it's not going to happen this time and that it's over for good. ♪ And the distance that's in between ♪ ♪ will what we were remain? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ and how can I... ♪ - Yeah. - Hi, lesbians. This is the real Dinah Shore. This is why you come to Palm Springs, right? Let's tee it up. - A golf tournament. Yes. - To play golf? What most people don't know is that Dinah Shore actually has nothing to do with lesbians. She actually wasn't even a lesbian. - She wasn't a lesbian. - She wasn't? - No. - No. Lesbians just happen to love golf. Dinah shore is actually a golf tournament. It has nothing to do with lesbians or drinking by a pool. It does now. Let the foursome begin. That's what I was saying, like...  Then I have done everything once. - Yes. - We had a foursome with Kacy and Cori in Palm Springs. - Lucky. - And it was hot. Let's stroke some shit. Uhh! Nice. [Gasps] That was sexy. Nice shot. Nice job. But I can't hit the ball. - Come on! - Ohh! All right. - Tap that ass. - Tap it in. Tap that ass. Too hard. No. I suck. I'm awful. I don't even care, though. I'm so, like, turned on by Kelsey golfing that I don't even care what I'm doing. I'm just hit... I just like hitting the balls. I'm your cheerleader. Fantastic. I don't what you did, but that looked good. That was hot. I love hanging out with Cori and Kacy. - They're sweethearts. - We love... they're sweet. They're good people, and I think it's nice to have couples around us that are married. I mean, we'd love to be married like that and start a family one day. I want to be married more than anything. Finally, I had a good one. High five. The unfortunate thing is this is on par with my actual driving. - Where am I going? - Wait, wait, wait! Don't drive on that green part. - No, no, no! - That way! That way! That way! Turn all the way around. [Screaming] - That was fun. - It was fun. I'm glad we did this. Thank you. That was a great game, yeah. It's a nice way to end Dinah. - It is. - Nice little game of golf. - Good friends. - Mm-hmm. And not having to go back to that pool party. Definitely ready to go home. [Party chatter] I gotta go though. See you girls later. We're gotta go that way. All right. We're going. We're gonna go. We're going to my room. Let's go. So it's the last day of Dinah, and things are winding down. It's a bittersweet moment. I'm really happy that I met Lauren, but I'm, like, sad to pull myself away from her, and I can't really seem to do it at this point. Do you like... rough? Sex? You like...  What do you mean? Tell me. Um...  Yeah, neither was I... at all. I think this might be a little more than just Dinah fun. I feel like there's something there. We should probably just part ways right now. [Laughs] Okay. Okay? Okay. Bye. Okay, bye. [Laughs] [All cheer] - Party time, fuckers. - Yay! [All giggling] Oh, my God. [Laughing] I feel like Lauren and I are having a moment, and then all of her friends crash the party and pretty much kill the mood. - Like, there's...  - There's ass everywhere! Ass, ass, ass. - Got it. - ♪ I'm not in love with you ♪ ♪ but I'm in love with the way you move ♪ [Squeals] [Laughter] [Laughing] It's Dinah. I'm intoxicated.

So Amanda and Kiyomi walk in, and I'm kissing Whitney and Sara, and all of a sudden, drunk girl wakes up like, "whoa, what's going on? "Who? Where? Who am I? Where am I, you guys? I have no idea." It's fine. I'm gonna go have a cigarette. And maybe lend you one too. I'm gonna have a drink. Crazy shit happens at Dinah Shore. It was a little strange to walk into that scene. I just don't really wanna be involved in some weird lesbian love triangle. What the fuck? What are you freaked out about? It's your fucking fault. No, it's not my fault. Okay. I mean, the make-out is totally not a big deal, but if you're walking into a room with a girl that you're just starting to hook up with and a couple, what's gonna happen here? Like, are they about to, like, do, like, a triple scissor next or something? Like, what would that look like? [Laughing] It's like double trouble. [Laughs] I feel like I need to go get regrouped with my people. - ♪ Somebody is jealous ♪ - Lesbians playing tennis. Somebody's jealous. You guys are annoying right now. [Laughs] You're so annoying. - Are you a jealous person? - I'm...  A jeal... ah, you're annoying. You're annoying me right now. It kind of showed me that she maybe cared a little bit more than I thought she did. And I was just having, like, fun Dinah times, and it sort of made me think, "okay, maybe I need to reel in a little bit. This might be going farther than I think." - [Snickers] - I'm not upset. I'm just kind of, like, weirded out, and I'm not really sure what's happening. So I think the best thing for me is to just leave. Bye.

How's that gonna go down? I know. Have you, like, even brought it up? Who? Have you brought it up to Kiyomi? Like, how's that gonna happen like, isn't her girl from New York gonna be there? It would be a little awkward, but I'm just gonna try to not think about it. I mean, the whole day is gonna be so busy and crazy that I'm really not gonna be worrying about this...  what this girl's doing, you know. Kiyomi told me Ali's flying in from New York, and I'm feeling a little sad 'cause I like Kiyomi. And I don't wanna be in this situation at all between two people all...  that are ending their thing.

Lauren and Amanda and Whitney and Sara really wanted to make it very clear that I knew that, you know, they were friends and that they were, like, the cool kids. You know, they let me know my place, and it really confirmed that these are not people I want in my life. Here we go.

I know. Tilt your head back. Sorry. I think we need to give you a group hug. I think you need to, like, go over there and just do your thing. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Just...  - It's just them, though. I got to get out there, though. This is just them, though. I see Romi crying, and that strikes a chord in me because Romi and I used to be so close. And I feel like, you know, we both miss each other very much, and I don't want to be in high school. I don't want to have drama with anybody. Whether or not you like me or I like you doesn't mean that it has to be the way that it is. So I think it's time to clear the air. - Okay. Good to go? - Yeah, you're good. - Great? - You're great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Here we go. Rolling. "No." This is... this is really fuckin' annoying. I actually noticed that Ali was poking her head through the door, and I'm sure she saw a lot of things that she didn't want to see, and, you know, I don't want to hurt her. I really don't, and I feel like we've already hurt each other enough, and it's time for it to be over. When I took a step away, I just had all this anxiety going, like... and...  and I realize that, like, we are not...  compatible, and, like, you know, a huge part of it has to do with the fact that we fight all the time. Don't forget about that. I don't want that for you. I'm just t... I'm t...  I think that...  you're fooling yourself a little bit, and I think that you know that you are. I know, but it's not...  it wasn't all good, like fighting as much as we do is not helping. This is not fucking good for me, like...  and it's not fair for you either.

How are you? Romi and I have a lot of history together. Obviously, things have gone in a horrible direction between us, and I decided to be the bigger person and to put away, you know, whatever ego that I had to actually pick up the phone, call her, and see if we could just sit down and talk about it. What did you want to talk about? Um... I know we're, like, in the same, like, vicinity of people, and so we run into each other and, you know, obviously I wish that we could still have the friendship that we once had, but I don't think that you're the person that you were the time that I met you. And I feel the same way about you. At the end of the day, what it really came down to with me with you is that last year, when everyone hated you and you were pulling shady shit on Whitney...  - How was I pulling shady shit? - With Erica...  - Because last I checked...  - Just hear me out. No, 'cause you weren't actually - there for me during that time at all. - Actually, I did call you the next day. I was the only person who called you. You were sitting there and so was I, - and you never once came to me. - And I said to you, "whether you did something or you didn't do it, that's not the point... that's not why I'm calling you." I called you because I loved you, and I called you 'cause you and me always said, regardless if you fucked up or you fucked up, it wasn't about calling fingers, it was that we were gonna be there for each other. - Of course. Yeah, totally. - And I've done that. No, you were not there for me, though, is the thing. You weren't. No, you weren't. I'm sorry. - Aside from what you think. - Then why did you call me here? What are you calling me here for, though? I want you to think about how many long lasting relationships that you have with friends. Think about that. I have a lot of friends, Sara, that you and Whitney...  - You do? Really? - Don't know about. Because I've been in your life now, and I've seen them come and go. - You too! - Within businesses...  - You too. - Friendships. And they've all gone. The common denominator here is you. - Okay. - Okay? Yes. Did you call me here to tell me this? I don't know what her goal is right now with me. I know that she's hurtful and she's mean. You didn't call me to work anything out, and I knew that. So I don't wanna sit here and be called to a lunch, so I can be attacked. I don't want to attack you, okay? That's not why I'm here. Okay? I was a really good friend to you, I was loyal to you, - I was honest with you, okay? - Oh, my God. Really? I wasn't? 'Cause you used to call me every day and tell me I was your best friend. - So did you! - Yeah. I thought you were my best friend. When you were fucking around and doing everything, and Julie and Whit, and you had nobody...  When you moved here, and you know what? - Who was I fucking around... - What does that have to do anything? I was your friend too...  because it's both ways, Sara. Oh, my God, you are out of your mind. - I was there for you... - You know, listen. - And you were there for me. - No, babe. Our friendship fell out. Sara wants to pull the card that I was a shady friend when Sara was fucking everyone in sight while she dated Whitney, and I never told Whitney, and I never said anything. I don't feel like I have any... I've done anything wrong. This is what I want from this, can you listen to me? - Please, please. - Okay. This is what I want. I don't want to see you and it to be weird between us. It's not weird, Sara. We see each other. You do your stuff, I do my stuff. - Yeah. - That's what it is. Like, I'm coming here because, like, I want us to, like, really talk about the whole situation. You have a wall up, and you're being, like, aggressive, and you're being rude to me. Listen, I was driving around Sara. You called me and said you wanted to talk. Can you listen to me? Can I talk to you? What did you ask me to come here for? - Why do you have get aggro? - Just tell me. Why do you have to get aggressive? 'Cause I didn't come here to do this! What is your problem you have, like, a chip on your shoulder, dude. I'm just trying to have a conversation with you. Can you relax? What do you want to say? - What are you so upset about? - What do you want to say? - Why are you so upset? - Just... Sara, please. - Can you just relax? - No, so if she asks me...  - I'm not finishing this. - Then I wanna know what I'm talking about. I'm, like, pissed about this, really. Honestly, I fucking am. Because I had so much invested into that relationship with Romi, I really loved her. You know, I always thought that maybe there would be a time where we can put everything aside and be friends. So, actually, sitting with her was really, like, eye-opening, you know, like there really is no turning back, and we will never be friends again. We can just never go there. [Sighs] Over it. I'm disgusted by her. I'm incredibly hurt by her, more than anything. She's consumed in herself right now. You don't treat people like that and get ahead. It will hit you in the ass.

Ready. Um...  - I'll see you downstairs. - Okay. - Wait for me in the car. - Is that our...  Is that our cue to meet you guys downstairs? - Yeah. Sorry. - Okay. - See ya. - All right. It's weird saying bye to Kiyomi today because so much has happened. We've spent so much time together. We really like being around each other, and we have a really good time, and we just feel comfortable together. And it's... so weird because I... I don't really... before, I didn't even want to be near someone and...  it's like...  I want to just be around her. And we're not exiting quickly enough. [Laughter] [Door closes] It was fun hanging out with you. Yeah, it was awesome. We both have our own lives to get back into. Uh-huh. So...  Dinah Shore is not reality. It's going to take a minute for me to normalize things in my life, I think, but, yeah. I just want to get back to New York and, like, focus on me for a minute, you know.
