 You're that runner guy. - You screwed up big-time. - You noticed, yeah? - What did you do? - Me? I was done for eating some pick 'n' mix. Me and this girl I was seeing - Sam. Police caught us. I had one wrap on me. She had the rest of it. No-one gets community service for possession. They said cos of my profile, they needed to send a message. WOMAN: They were the last people to see him. They know something. It's them.

 Ahhh! MAN: Maybe he left you. WOMAN: He'd never do that to me. He wouldn't. CURTIS: All this, it's already happened once. SAM: What are you saying? What? You turned back time? Everything happened again! Exactly the same! SIMON: They're going to think the probation worker's still alive. I stole his credit card. I used it to book a flight. I know you want to. All I have to do... is touch you. Ahhh! Keith was talking to your mate and he's a dog, yeah? - It's doing my head in. - Get her tits out. You don't need to use your power on me. I'm already there.

 (STARTER PISTOL FIRES) (ALARM BEEPS) (REGGAE MUSIC PLAYS) ALISHA: Curtis? Hi. (METALLIC RUMBLING) (LAUGHS) (it THE RAPTURE'. Echoes) # The city breathing The people churning # The conversating The price is what? # The conversating This place is heaven # And if you see them They're saying what? # Oh, my God! That is such a shamer. Do you think he's told the others? NATHAN: Bashing himself out of it. Yeah. I'm pretty sure he told 'em. And she was totally clicking the mouse off herself, man. KELLY: No way! NATHAN: They were just, like, really face-to-face. He was wanking, she was flicking her own bean, right in each other's face. SIMON: You should've filmed it. Work that bean! Work that bean, Kelly, my love! Oh! Er, hi. - Shut up. - You enjoyed it, you pervert. - (LAUGHS) - What? Do you want to have a look too? No, thanks. I'm OK. Can I have another look? Prick. Does anyone actually know what he got done for? - Says it was for eating pick 'n' mix. - That's bullshit. Are you two, like, together? Yeah, I guess. It's weird, yeah? Cos of my bullshit power thing, we don't actually have proper sex. We just stare at each other and wank ourselves off. But it is really special. Come on. It's not gay cos we're not touching. All you want to do is get down to it and you can't, cos... Hi. - That's really disgusting. - It's not fucking disgusting. When did you get out? A few days ago. It's good to see you. You're saying Tony's walking round using his credit card. (LAUGHS) So why has no-one seen him? Because it's not him! Someone's stolen it. Look, if you're not going to do anything, then I will. How was it in there? Well, wasn't a lot of laughs. How you doing? How's community service? Is what it is, innit? Just need to get through it. It's all so messed up. Screwed our lives over a bit of coke. You're out now. You need to move on. Do something different. Think anyone's gonna give me a job with a conviction for dealing? I saw you with that girl. Are you with her? She's beautiful. It just happened, like. I didn't mean it to. And there's stuff going on with me right now, things I can't tell you about. Sam! I'm sorry. Sam? I'm sorry. - Why didn't you visit me? - Cos I felt too guilty, innit? I asked you to buy the gear. It should've been me that went prison. Things didn't work out like that, did they? I told 'em. I told the police it was for me and my mates. They wouldn't listen. Trust me, if I could do anything to change it, I would. You should've visited me! I know. I couldn't see you in there. - I couldn't look you in the eye. - So you hook up with someone else? She's helping you deal with it, is she? My life is fucked! And that's on you. Sam! (# SKEPTA: Rolex Sweep) # Now do the Rolex sweep Rolex sweep, Rolex sweep # I told her to drink up Selecta, play the song that I asked for # If you wanna link up You can meet me on the dance floor # 50 Cent can't dance like me # Soulja Boy can't dance like me # Michael Jackson can't dance like me # No, so c-c-count with me # One, glass of champagne for me # Two, glass of champagne for you # Three, now do the Rolex sweep # Do the Rolex sweep # Do the Rolex sweep Do the Rolex sweep... # - We can't buy any drugs. - What are you talking about?

I could have you arrested for that. Really? For eating some pick 'n' mix? You're paying for the sweets in your mouth and for that drink. "Beverley". Isn't that a woman's name? - Pay up and leave. - (LAUGHS) Beverley. That's brilliant. Why did your parents give you a girl's name? This is your final warning. Maybe you were born with both sets of genitalia, you know, like a chick with a dick. Can I have Security to the concession stand, please? But your parents wanted a boy so they kept your cock and sewed up your change. You're coming with me! I'm being assaulted by a chick with a dick! Ow! Help me! They sewed up his clunge!

I know I'm better than this, because, Bev, if I'm not, I'll probably have to kill myself. You haven't got a clue. Look, I've done mucking around! You either pay for this damage or I'll call the police. What's it to be? Call the police! No, wait, hold on, hold on. I'll pay the damage. All right? Actually...you know, forget it. Call the cops.

So, what's it going to cost me to sort this out? - I don't want your money. - Oh, really? Cos I don't see anybody else rushing down here to bail you out. I didn't ask you to come down here and bail me out, so... Don't be a wanker. (CHUCKLES) Thanks for the fatherly advice. It makes me feel all warm inside. What do we owe you? Beverley, I don't want him paying for it. You want him to call the police? Yeah. I do, actually. Bev, call the police. Yeah, you heard the man. Go on, call the police. Call 'em! Are you still here?

L--- I thought you were someone else. What happened? We were doing our community service and the probation worker flipped out. Just... Just went crazy and then... Then he killed them. How come you survived? They said I was half dead when they found me. I guess I'm just lucky. I didn't stop him. - Argh! - What's that? Did you know them? I wasn't there. I wasn't there. I should've been caught. I could've stopped this. I wasn't there. I wasn't there.
