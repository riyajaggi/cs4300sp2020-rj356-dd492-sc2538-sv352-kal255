 Sweet moves, Larry. Sashi, flying shark. Where? Ha. Winner and still champion-- Okay, painful yet hilariously timed collision aside, I think it's pretty clear who the winner was. It's not always about winning. Sometimes, it's about what you can steal from your opponents' backpack while they are winning. Oh, come on, Boone, I was saving that. Here, my moms packed me some pickled chubfish. What-- Ugh... Oh, Boone. Power is out. No power, no mission. ( tire screeching ) Ha-ha, you lose again, Larry. No, block has no power. No zap. Just as well, Rippen. We would've crushed you again, anyway. What's that, like a billion times in a row now? Oh... Oh, we could go to my place for a snack. ALL: No, thanks. Oh, okay, I-I'll leave the invitation open, like I did for my Christmas party. And my Halloween party. And-- And my Arbor-Day party... Maybe someone will come this time. Hmm. MAN:  Welcome to Larry Manor. Whoa, did you win the lottery or something? Nope. I won 32 lotteries. 32 times? How? By buying the winning tickets, silly. Wow. Is that a-- a gift shop? Larry. Rippen, say hello to my teacup elephant, Tony. I'd rather drown in a pool of balsamic vinegar. ( whispers ) That's just his way of saying he loves you. Lady and gentlemen, snack is served. Whoa. You have a butler? Young lady, you are mistaken. He's not Master Larry's butler. I am. Um, then who's that? He's my butler. Please keep hands and feet  inside the cars at all times. ( speaking in foreign language ) Pfft, yeah, got to be careful on the kiddy train-- Whoa! -32 Express right on time. ( crackling ) Finally. We get mission. WOMAN: Boone, your phone's ringing. LARRY: And so he says, "No, it's duck fur." You can't just shout out random punch lines to jokes and expect people to figure out the setup. Oh, and you can tell a joke. Darn right I can. Here's one: What do you call a chef with bananas in his ears? Anything you want. He can't hear you. He can't hear you... Because of the bananas in his... Oh, how I despise each of you so. FREDERICS: I'm afraid I have some terrible, terrible news. Frederics. This information is too important for a butler's butler to announce. Master Tony's missing! The elephant? Oh, no. Okay, let's all make a vow right now that finding Tony is the number one priority in our lives. Uh, I'll give whoever finds him a $25 gift card to A Little Piece O' Larry. Why would I want $25 worth of Larry merch? Is little Rippy afraid of a little competishi? Au contraire. Rippy welcomes competishi. Ha, you miss. I was not aiming for you, idiot. Hurry, we can't let Rippen find that elephant first. This isn't a mission. The fate of the world doesn't depend on this. No, but the fate of our bragging rights does. Now who will follow me on this menial task? Come on! Seriously? A snake room? Technically, it's not a "snake room" 'cause it's also full of bats. PZ, I think this is a sign we should stop looking for Tony. BOONE: Oh... ( giggling ) Tell my mom I'll send for fresh underwear and flipflops. Then I guess it's all up to me. Everything reminds me of Tony. Here's where he ate his first peanut. This is the peanut plant that made that peanut, and look, look, look, this is the man who sold me the seed for that peanut plant. Eh, yup. I mean, it's just-- I mean, I... There, there. There, there, there. Speaking of there, I'm, I'm going to be over there. Wow, should've brought my jungle wear and pith helmet. Hello? Ah! Psst. Master Zero, I know the whereabouts of Master Tony and I'm afraid foul play is afoot. All fingers point to... Matthews. Aha. So the butler did do it. A little cliche, but I'll go with it. She's keeping Master Tony in her quarters. Hurry, I'll take you to him now. RIPPEN: Oh, that won't be necessary. I know the way. That gift certificate I don't want is as good as mine. What on earth are you doing in my head-butler quarters? Oh, nothing, just winning. This is madness. I didn't put him there. Take that, Penn Zero. Matthews, this is not the behavior of a butler with a butler. We need to get out of here and save that genetically-modified pygmy sized elephant. Master Tony's perfectly safe. I'm worried about us. I'm sorry, wait, wait, wait. How do you know Master Tony is safe? Oh, uh, wishful thinking, I suppose. Wait a minute. That's Tony's adorable little beanie. All right. All right. I absconded with Master Tony and framed Matthews. But she had it coming when Master Larry promoted her over me. Well, you have no idea how much it hurts to constantly be outdone by someone. Maybe not, old bean, but I think I know how to get us out of here. Oh, gross. I'm innocent, I tell you-- there's no need for rough treatment! FREDERICS: She's telling the truth. I did it. I took Master Tony. Ha, I found the elephant. Where did he go? Victory was mine. ( Tony trumpets ) No, Master Tony, don't go in the snake-room- that-also-has-bats. Tony. Whoa. Ah! I win. You lose again, Rippen. No! I was so close. You have no idea how much it hurts to constantly be outdone. Come on, Penn. Ah. More bats, oh, no! I won. I beat you. I won. Yes, I won. You lose. Now you explode in sun. Good luck. Question: Who's number one? Well, if this oversized novelty hand is to be believed, it's me. Oh, all this winning sure makes me itchy. Yes, me. It's okay, PZ, we'll get 'em next time. Number one, finally. You know, Sosh, I'm okay. Winning isn't everything. Number one! I apologize, Matthews. I simply wanted to feel what it was like to be out from under your magnificent shadow, if only for a moment. I'll go pack my things. As I dare say you should. You'll need to move them to your new room in the co-butler quarters. You mean-- Oh! Oh, there, there. Yes. ? There's a little butler from the sea ? ? He came up out and heartily ? ? Swam with the fishes, was a true mate ? ? But also kept his bowtie ramrod straight ? Hey, I won again.
