 - [Vinnie] [clears throat] Yes. - You don't work for me, huh? You got some surprise  I don't know about? [upbeat orchestral theme music] [dramatic music] - [Anthony] The murder of  David Steelgrave has left the Atlantic City mob in a  precarious situation. We intend to take  advantage of that. - Do you intend to indict  on the Malhouse Amendment? - Yes. - Come on, Tony, this  doesn't look good. It's Grand Central here. - We work in this  office, O'Brien, you want good looks,  go down to the beach

 and check out the bikinis. [crew chuckles] - This week, you're  chasing jabrones. When you running for governor? - Of course I wanna be governor. - No kidding. - I'm an ambitious guy. But that's not the agenda. - Hey, a tomato pie! - Come here, Angelo. This is who we're working for. - Where'd you get this shill? - The average Joe  who's being strangled, overt or insidious,  know it or not, by the tentacles of organized  crime in this state. - Vinnie! - Angelo works hard  for very little money. Out of every dollar he  makes, nearly 15 cents ends up in the hands of the mob. - 15 cents? - When are you gonna  bring out the guy on the crutches and heal him? - [Anthony] Period. - Yo, Terranova, what you doing, putting on lipstick? - All right,  already, I'm coming. - The grand jury hands  down indictments, I expect convictions. - [O'Brien] The casinos are  under a 24 hour microscope-- - Yeah, yeah! - Mob controlled goods  and services run right up to the edge of casinos, they don't need to go in and skim, the money  comes out to them in the form of vending  contract, pension programs. And they use the most  draconian methods. - Huh? - He means like Dracula. - Men like Patrice  and Mahoney sit across their respective rivers and suck our state dry, using Sonny  Steelgrave as a straw. [Sonny spits] - You mezzamook. This is where you think. I'm not for sucking  on by nobody. - [O'Brien] Sonny Steelgrave is the focus of your investigation? - He's the biggest  bum in New Jersey. - You calabres geek. [TV smashes] - Always get a radio. [phone ringing] Hello? - [Man on phone]  Sonny Steelgrave in? - Yeah, who is it? - [Man on phone] Tell him  Paul Patrice is on the line. - Just a minute. Sonny. - What? - [Vinnie] Paul Patrice. - Paul. - [Paul] You see Serrera? - Yeah, I just heard him. The guy's a creep. - [Paul] We gotta talk. Tonight, Sonny. - Tonight? We're roasting Chickie tonight. He's got the Big C. - [Paul] What's  he doing about it? - [Sonny] Retiring to Florida. - [Paul] You're gonna  have to be a little late. - I don't wanna  be a little late. - [Paul] I want you  to be a little late. It's important, Sonny. - Yeah, okay. - What's a matter,  Sonny, you all right? - Load up. We're gonna meet  Pat the Cat Patrice. [gentle music] [dramatic music] - Sonny, I gotta stop  for gas, all right? I'm gonna go get a coffee. - Stay here. - Hey, whoa, Sonny, I  think we're being followed. - Of course we're  being followed, this is Patrice  we're dealing with. Know what's going on here? I'm being measured. Like for a bigger  chair at the table. Or a box. - Well, if it's gonna be a box, you better make it a doublewide. [upbeat music] [phone ringing] - Sailor Hardware. - Agent 4587. Day code, Style section. Seven, seven, ident procedure,  fortunate, muffler, juice. - You sound tense, Vinnie. - Yeah, I'm heading  north on the turnpike for a meet with  Pat the Cat Patrice at some lanes in Sayreville,  but I don't know the name. - We'll locate. What do you think, man? You need some cover? - I got company. - [Daniel] Vinnie! [fist punches]  - Oh! - Here, I got this from Goofy. His pal Blueloo's  right behind us. [laughs] Here, take the wheel. [dramatic music] - [Goon] Oh! [car crunches] [tires squeal] [tires squeal] - Good evening, boys. What's the status? - Steelgrave and one of his thugs are going into  the bowling alley. - Mr. Patrice would  like to see you alone. - Then Mr. Patrice  can come to my house. - Is that him? - Yep. You know why we meet here? - No. - Any place smaller  won't hold his ego. - [Paul] Sonny. - Pat. - [Paul] You look good, Sonny. Standing up to the pressure. - [Sonny] [clears throat]  Pat, this is Vinnie Terranova. Vinnie, Mr. Patrice. - Mr. Patrice. - Vinnie. This is Simonetti. What will you do about Greco? - He's like swamp gas. - See these bags? How puffy? - If those are bags,  they must be Fendi. - I love this guy. Nothing worries him. I don't sleep at night. I don't sleep, it  keeps Simonetti up. Which keeps Ferragamo  and Sweeney up. Pretty soon,  everybody's got bags. - I get the picture. An epidemic of insomnia. Am I a doctor, or what? - I'm up worrying  about my investment in Steelgraves Properties. - We ever miss a dividend? - Your brother's never  been dead before. Greco is gone, or worse, he's off squawking to the Justice Department. You're under attack from  the state Attorney General. - Yeah, I can't catch a break. - This is not a joke! - Then what is it? Don't you profit from the  way I conduct business? - My blessing is your business. This man Vinnie, I never  saw him before in my life. But you bring him to  my private business. - [Sonny] He's a good man. - Your business is so  screwed up by events that at your right hand, there's new blood. This isn't a personal  thing, Vincenzo. I have no ill feeling for you. You really carry black tie well. I don't even mind you  drove one of my cars in a ditch and smashed my  man's head into a truck. - He was tailgating. - What can I do  to help you sleep that won't keep  me awake at night? - Let me recommend men to  shore up your soft spots. Executives. To help you recover  from the setbacks. A management team. - How many? - Four men, like  an advisory board. [ominous music] - I want you to shoot me right between the eyes. - Sonny. - Please. I can die like a man. I'm not gonna let  you castrate me. Please. Kill me. [gun cocks] [dramatic music] - I have this accountant. Strictly a numbers guy. Went to Harvard Business School, Sid Royce. He's okay. Please, Sonny,  you need the help. - He do heavy work? - He's an accountant! Sonny, he ever killed anybody,  they died of a headache. Please, Sonny, help  me sleep at night. I've got 30 mill tied up in  this Steelgrave business. - Sure. - Not bad, kid. Not bad. [Sonny laughing and coughing] - He was tailgating. [laughing] - So what? - So nobody, nobody,  especially new guys, talk to Patrice like that. Know how Pat the Cat  got his nickname? - No. - He was 14, he and some friends got together and decided to put  cigarettes out on their arms, and hold their hands over matches, you know, macho, I can take  it, kind of stuff. - Yeah. - They decided the ultimate  test of who's toughest was to stick a cat  down their underwear. - Go on, get outta here. - Yeah. [laughing] So they go out and get  this old alley cat, had claws like a steak knife. They started passing him around, nobody can get it  past their belt lines. So they finally  pass it to Paulie. Paulie was always a  little nuts, you know? Oh my God, he takes  this cat [laughing] by now it's a bit agitated,  he takes it by the head, he yells and shoves  it down his pants. The cat caught his  attention real quick. So much so, that he  couldn't stand up straight [laughing] to get it out! - Yeah, but wait a minute,  what happened to the, oh, never mind. - The cat? Yeah, well, gasoline  and a match. Sucker ran and screamed 'til it was toast. - [Woman] Morning,  Mr. Steelgrave. - Call Vinnie, tell  him I want him up here in his work clothes. - Yes sir, Mr. Steelgrave? There's a man using  your brother's office. - What the? Put that down! Oh, come on, get outta  here, get out, out! Out, out! - Ah, Mr. Steelgrave,  some coffee? I'm Sid Royce, and I must say it's a pleasure to meet a true entrepreneur. Mm-hmm, very impressed. I am very impressed  by what you've done. Pardon me a second. Please wait outside. [chuckles] You know there  probably aren't, oh, a hundred men on earth  that know tax code like I do, yes? But I wish I had your, your talent for building an empire. I'm a virtuoso manager,  but without men like you, what, indeed what,  would we manage? This is your brother  Dave who died, yes? If it doesn't disturb  you, I'd like to keep this on my desk as a, as a  reminder of excellence, mm? - Welcome aboard, Sid. - Thanks. - Settle in, we'll  go over things. - Excellent. - I've just been fondled by the Invisible Man. - Yeah? So why aren't you smiling? Where we going? - Got a surprise for you. [forklift whirring] - [Vinnie] Hey, Sonny. - I told you you'd  get Greco's action. Hey, Tookie! This is a legit operation. Tookie knows it inside out, he's got a problem, he comes to you, you got  a problem, you come to me. This is where Greco  took advantage of me. - You know I won't. - Tookie, Vinnie's  the new dock boss. - You're Terranova? - Yeah. - Your Uncle Mike's  been calling. - That deadbeat. - You two guys get along. Can I get a day off from this? - [Vinnie] Who's that, Patrice? - That's the great white  himself, No Money Mahoney. Patrice has got a guy here,  he wants one here, too. - Hey, but you gonna let him? - He's my goomba. - Sonny. - Don't start with me, mac. - Got to, Sonny. You let New York  put a guy in here. - Keeps things smooth. - Hey, Philadelphia's got interest here, too. You, you're one of us. But the Cat? We gotta have a guy here, too. - Who? - Best dock guy I got. He could be my eyes  without Patrice feeling like he's  working a bent joint. Hey, Hunch, outta the car. My man, Harry Schanstra. What do you say I drop a few coin at your place? - How ya doing, Harry,  I'm Vinnie Terranova. - Call me Hunch. - All right, Hunch. Now listen, I got some family  problems to take care of, is it all right if Tookie looks after you? - I can take care of  myself, you little bastard. [cane thwacks] - Ow! [phone rings] - Morning, Sailor Hardware. - It's Agent 4587, day  code, Style section, seven, eight, ident procedure,  even, elevator, garbanzo. - Vinnie, my wayward boy. - Hey, Uncle Mike phone calls  from you really throw me. What's the crisis? - [Daniel] McPike wants to see you, ASAP. - Why? - If I knew why, I  wouldn't be the Lifeguard, I'd be the Director. The question is when,  the answer is now. - Where? - It's McPike, how can you ask? [dogs barking] - What do you want, Frank? - I want an update, Vinnie. - Is that what this is about? - It ain't a beer with the boys. - Frank, this is dangerous. - [Frank] You spent  the other evening with Paul Patrice. - Yeah, so, who told you? - There is a Terranova Marine open for business on the waterfront,  and all I'm getting is your engagement calendar. - [Vinnie] So  what's the problem? - The problem is, Vinnie,  we've never had a guy in this deep before. - This isn't gonna be  another one of your lectures about the corruption of money, is it, Frank? - I am to be kept informed. - Yeah, well, information  isn't that easy to come by. Now, they don't leave  files laying around marked incriminating evidence. Your Special  Prosecutor, Serrera, he's got 'em  circling the wagons, it's a lot harder  to get at the goods. - Maybe he'll get the job done. - Yeah, and maybe he blows it at my expense. - You are right next  to Patrice, Steelgrave and Mahoney. Now how come all the cage  rattling's being done by Serrera? - Frank, I've read all  the books, there's no identity crisis here. My problem is trying to keep these guys at ease, when Serrera's got 'em hooked  up to the electrical outlets. Hey Frank, do us both  a favor, will ya? Tell him to keep it to himself until he's got indictments,  because otherwise he's just grandstanding. - All right, I talk to Serrera, you talk to me, Vinnie. Big meetings going on? - Yeah. Yeah, Sonny's vulnerable. Patrice knows it, so he  sent in a guy to help out. So now Mahoney sends in a  guy to watch Patrice's guy. - That sounds like  the makings of a war. - Yeah, it's real dicey. So what I need from you is a profile on a guy by the name of Harry The Hunchback Schanstra-- - Wait a sec. - Recently of the  Philadelphia docks, and Sidney David Royce. Now, Patrice claims this guy's an accountant, but I think he's a cobra. Oh and here, I got this off  of one of Patrice's thugs. All right? - All right, what a second. - What? - This is where we  meet from now on. Anything else? - Well yeah, one more thing. - Hmm? - You know, you're standing in puppy poop. [dogs barking] [phones ringing] - Mr. Steelgrave. Mr. Royce wants to see you. [Sonny humming] - What, are we in the  school lunch business now? - Interesting idea. We do have a problem, though. A Mr. Randellino. - [Sonny] Eh? - Charles Randellino. I believe some people call  him Choo-choo or something. - Chuke. What's the problem.? - What exactly are his duties? - Keeps me on top  of street gossip, gets me espresso,  tells me dirty jokes. - Court jester, hm? He's a cocaine addict,  I've let him go. - Let him go where? - Well now, I told him  there was very little chance of allowing  him to stay here. Since he was supplying some of the secretaries, who are also gone. - This guy's been  with me over 10 years. How'd you find out  what I didn't know? - I've instituted a company  drug testing program. - You what? - It'll go down well in mainstream business, and be a potential defense ploy against any prosecution charges  in related areas. Patrice has been very successful keeping a clean house with this program. - Patrice? - Mm-hmm. [Charles sniffs] - [Charles] I'm sorry, captain. - Don't say it, Chuke. You're breaking our  heart, you know that? - I'll try and stop. - Not good enough. It's 10 grand there, should  last you about six months, come back clean, we'll talk. - I'm sorry. - Get out. [gentle music] Gimme some good news. [keyboard clacking] [keyboard clacking] Maggie, what's  with the computer? - [Maggie on intercom] Mr. Royce changed the access codes. - Mr. Royce? Mr. Royce. Mr. Royce. [fist smacks]  - Oh! - My name is Steelgrave. It's on the door, it's  on the foundation. It'll be the last  word outta your mouth if you change a thing in my  business without asking first. You're here to protect  Patrice's interests, you do that. You put your claws on  my interests again, and I'll personally  crush your skull. Mm-hmm? [door slams] - Yeah, time to send the long shot to Serrera. A gift from Sonny. [Frank whistling] - Hold it. - Hold it? Since when does a pizza carry more weight than a federal badge? - Hello, Mr. Serrera? - Yeah, back here, Angelo. New delivery boy, Angelo? - No, sir, he's a G-man. Boom! [laughs] - Uh, Mr. Serrera, my  name is Frank McPike, Federal Bureau of Investigation. You're making Sonny  Steelgrave a very nervous man. - Thanks. You wanna slice? - No thanks, stuff'll kill you. I was wondering if we could  work together on this. - How? - Exchange ideas, information. - [Anthony] Like what? - I think it's wiser  to keep a low profile 'til after the indictments. - I don't mind ticking  these guys off, I don't think it  puts me in jeopardy. - Yes, sir, but you're  not the only one. - You got somebody on  the inside, don't you? [phone rings] Hello. [dramatic music] - What is it? - They know her mother's name. They know the trailer  court she lives in in Clearwater, Florida. - What is it, what's her name? - [Anthony] He said he'd cut out her heart. - I got a scramble on 1340. Give me a name and address. - She's 80 years old. - [Reporter] At the top of the news tonight, Special Prosecutor Anthony  Serrera finds himself surrounded by bodyguards,  following death threats. Serrera has been  spearheading an investigation into Steelgrave Industries. - Hey, hey, kid, look at this. - [Reporter] We're  live at the offices of Special Prosecutor-- - Not gonna hit  me again, are ya? - I'm a friend, I'm too  twisted not to have enemies. - This guy's got enemies. - I received a phone  call last night, threatening my life and the  lives of the people I love. I will not be cowed  by these threats. The investigation into  links between mobsters like Paul Patrice and  state-sanctioned businesses controlled by Sonny Steelgrave will continue for as long as it takes to bring these people to justice. [TV crashes] - I'm gonna kill that son of a-- - Sh! How'd you last this long with such a big mouth? - Someone's putting the screws to me, Hunch. It's Patrice, or it's Mahoney. If it's Mahoney,  you got problems! Now, look at me straight  and tell me it ain't you. - I was shootin' craps  with your old man the day you was born. I heard the doc smack your rump. Which I've considered myself. - Hey, come on. - Tookie can take  care of business here. I need help with Serrera. - What, Sonny, what,  you want him dusted? - What, are you getting stupid on me, too? I need information. See what's on the  streets, find Chuke. Maybe he knows what's happening. [drill buzzes] - Hey, Frank. Hey, did you bring  that puppy home? - Yeah, yeah. This a sentimental visit? - Nah, Serrera got a phone call. - Yeah, I know, I was there,  the guy turned to chalk. You should be keeping an eye  on our number one suspect. - Hey, Sonny is the last guy to hit Serrera. - Oh, yeah? Then we got trouble. - [Vinnie] What,  couldn't you trace it? - Yeah, computer spit  out a phone booth on Vintner Avenue. Cold as a fish. - Well, I wanna  check it out myself. - 1223 1/2 Vintner, unless  you're expecting to find vibrations, you're  wasting your time. - Hey, Frank? - [Frank] Mm? - Thanks. - For what? - For believing me when I said  Sonny isn't hitting Serrera. - Who said I believed you? [gentle music] [ominous music] - Hey, Chuke. Chuke! I'm sorry, Sonny, but, uh,  you know, with my record, I can't afford to be  dealing with the cops. Especially when the guy's  got a nose full of coke. He'd been dead about an hour. - Forget it, man. Chuke knew what he  was dealing with. When I found him,  he was a drunk. Guess I paid him enough money to afford him a deadlier addiction. - Want me to go up with you? - Royce is a gentleman,  this is his Ivy League club, what do you think, he's gonna beat me to death with snot? - All right. Gimme a slice, will ya? - [Sonny] I'm meeting  with Mr. Royce. - Yes. That will be a  private dining room. Please follow me. - [Worker] Here ya go. - Thanks a lot. - [Worker] Thanks a lot. [crowd chattering] - [Reporter] Serrera, Serrera. [dramatic music] [ominous music] - Sonny! [gun fires] [gun fires] [ominous music] - [Reporter] Special  Prosecutor Anthony Serrera was the target today of  an assassination attempt. The sniper seriously wounded one of Serrera's assistants, but the  Special Prosecutor himself was unhurt. Arrested at the scene were  alleged underworld boss Sonny Steelgrave along  with a reputed Steelgrave soldier, Vincent Terranova. - Thought you might  like some water. [water splashes] Look at that, I tripped. I'll get you some more. - Oh, I don't think so. Get out. Get out! And you put yourself on report. You got me? - [Officer] Yes sir. - Talk to me. What do you wanna hear, Frank? Sonny didn't do it. - Then who? - Patrice, probably. Sid Royce-- - Sid Royce? Sid Royce, MBA Harvard,  1973, this guy is a leader in the financial community. Council on Economic Advisors,  International Committee on Loan Redlining, this is  not an easy gun to pin down. - If you let them charge Sonny, I'm gonna have to take the  stand as a federal agent and eyewitness. Now, I want him just  as bad as you do, but I will not lie under oath. - I respect your morality! - All right. What about Harry? - The hunchback? - [Vinnie] Yeah. - Oh, this sweetheart  has been in the biz since he was 10 years old. There are guys in  South Philadelphia who call him The Professor. He is roughly the mob  equivalent of a historian. - Well, what about the gun? - You forget about the gun. We are this close  from being made. I am having to throw  around federal weight to release the very guy that  we're trying to pin down. - But Frank, what we're  trying to do is bring down the structure, if you just want this one guy, you can pick him up tomorrow. - [Frank] Right. - All right, so  what's the problem? [knocking at door] What? [officer whispering softly] We've got a curve ball. - What? - Sonny made a deal for bail. All you gotta do is  pass a polygraph. Since your whole cover's a lie, the machine's gonna bust you. - Great. [needles scratching] - Is your name Vinnie Terranova? - [Vinnie] Yes. - Are you 30 years old? - [Vinnie] Yes. - [Technician] Do you  work for Sonny Steelgrave? - [clears throat] Yes. - Look what I get  from my lawyers! You don't work for me, huh? You got some surprise  I don't know about? - Wait a minute,  Sonny, now slow down. I lied on half of  those questions, I was scared to death. - Whatya gotta lie about? - Well, Sonny, you  don't fill me in on everything, you  know, I think you got good reason to wanna  take out Serrera, so I was afraid they was  gonna be asking me about that. You don't believe me? Look, look, look,  go ahead and look. - Get outta here. - I bit half my  mouth off trying to, trying to screw up that machine. - I don't need to  look in your mouth. I'm being set up, stepped  on, and rolled over. - Yeah, that's right,  and you know by who. I wanna do him. What? - If we do him, isn't Patrice just gonna send somebody else in? I mean, at least with Royce,  we know what we got, right? Huh? - You're right, he'll win. That doesn't solve the problem. [ball thwacking] - Who's the muscle  on the Serrera hit? - Nobody I know. - Well, if it wasn't  for outside contracts, Americans wouldn't eat pizza. - How do you figure? - Ah, this business is doomed. 'Cause you kids ain't got no sense of history. Now, Lucky figured the  best way to get rid of a business problem was  to bring in outside muscle, make the hit, send 'em home. Works to this day. But Genovese, he opened a  pizza parlor in Redhook, brought in Sicilian  muscle to work it. They'd stay week, month, get a go on a hit, and boom, back to Sicily  with an American fortune. Next thing you know,  there's pizza stands from Brooklyn to Barleymon. [ball thwacking] [dramatic music] Costello, he'd bring  in two, three guys on a single contract. Long guy, short guy,  and a prima facie. Well, time to saw wood. - Now, wait a minute,  wait a minute. Long guy, short guy, what  are you talking about? - Yeah, long guy. 50 yards or more. Short guy, inside  the 25 yard line. - Prima facie, sticks  the gun in your face and pulls the trigger, right? - Nah, nah, that guy's an idiot. Prima facie like puts  a pound of dynamite in your shorts and boom! First thing you see  is your face come off. [phone ringing] - Yeah. - Sonny, this is Vinnie. Listen, I need some help. I think I know how to  stop the Serrera hit. - Out front, ASAP. - Yeah. - Killing Serrera could cost us the casino, yes? Well then, I have  a moral obligation to report to Mr. Patrice. - You got a moral obligation. How do you know? - [Sonny] What do you got? - [Vinnie] Pizza. - [Sonny] Pizza? - Yeah, Harry says  that the Genoveses used to hold out of town  contractors and pizza joints. - Right. And whose family  does the Cat got? Patrice is up to his  buns in mozzarella. Ain't nothin' to it. Just a couple hundred  pizza joints in this town. - There's only one  possibility, Rieti's. You know, where Angelo works. - [Sonny] Angelo? - Yeah, you know,  the guy from TV. Serrera's immigrant we're  beating outta 15 cents, remember that? - Oh yeah, yeah, all  right, all right. [ominous music] [dramatic music] Hey, come here! [speaking foreign langauage] [speaking foreign langauage] [speaking foreign langauage] - Go on, swear on my mother,  gone back to Palermo! [speaking foreign langauage] [gun cocks] Duck town, 18-seater! Top floor! [door crashes] [dramatic music] - Look at this, man. Triggering device  for a bomb mechanism. - [Vinnie] It's a  garage door opener. Angelo's a prima facie. [dramatic music] - You've convinced me.  - You know what, Mr. Serrera, - I took an oath--  - your political career-- - [Guard] Hold it, hold it. - Hey, we gotta see Serrera. - I'll have to call up. Who are you? - Let's go. [dramatic music] - Too late, man! [dramatic music] - This is gonna  be end of me, huh? 'Cause of that mezzamook? [bomb explodes] [dramatic music] [debris clatters] - Did I do that? [seagulls crying] - Hey, Hunch. What are you doing here? - Surveilling and  surmising for Mahoney. - Oh, yeah? So, what have you surveilled and surmised? - That you's too smart  for this business. - Hey, Hunch, how'd Mahoney  get the nickname No Money? - When he was a kid, bet all the money he'd make in his life that  Patrice couldn't put  a cat in his shorts. - Save a guy's life,  this is what I get. I know it was you. - Pardon? - Pardon? Not in this organization, pal. [upbeat dramatic music] [light orchestral music]
