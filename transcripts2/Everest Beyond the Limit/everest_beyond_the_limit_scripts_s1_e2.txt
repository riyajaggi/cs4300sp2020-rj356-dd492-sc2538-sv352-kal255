 Everest: Beyond the Limit (2006–…): Season 1, Episode 2 - The Gatekeeper - full transcript 
 It's the best weather for years on Everest and normally cautious Russ decides to gamble on a secret early summit. He spots a weather window in two weeks time but his Sherpas will have to work flat out to put the necessary tents and oxygen in place and his climbers will have to stay uncomfortably high to complete their acclimatisation in time. For some climbers it's bad news - they don't look ready. As the weather window approaches, Russ makes up his mind to go for it, but it's a close call. The two summit teams are announced and there's no going back.

 TRIES TO SAVE AN UNKNOWN CLIMBER FROM DYING OF CEREBRAL EDEMA. WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM AND DID MY INITIAL ASSESSMENT, I THOUGHT HE WASN'T GONNA MAKE IT. THE FIRST THING IN YOUR MIND IS, "THIS IS A DEAD MAN." Bill: HE WENT FROM BASICALLY STANDING TO FULLY CRUMPED OVER TO UNCONSCIOUS IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES. SPIT! SPIT! HE DIDN'T EVEN GROAN, DIDN'T EVEN RESPOND. I MEAN, HE WAS THAT FAR GONE. WE'RE BUILDING A STRETCHER, AND WE'RE GONNA GET HIM DOWN THE HILL A.S.A.P. GUYS, GO AHEAD AND GET YOURSELF SET UP. LET'S GET GOING. Russell: IF YOU'RE COMING TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST, YOU SHOULD MAKE A VERY FIRM DECISION IN YOUR MIND THAT THERE IS A CHANCE TO DIE. EVERYONE THAT'S HERE -- FILM CREW, SHERPAS, GUIDES, CLIENTS -- THEY ALL HAVE A RISK FACTOR THAT SOMETHING COULD GO WRONG. [ MONITOR BEEPING ] Narrator: THE NEXT MORNING, THE CLIMBERS GET TERRY'S PROGNOSIS. THAT WAS KIND OF AN INTERESTING DAY. HAD AN INDIAN THAT WAS SUFFERING FROM CEREBRAL EDEMA. SPENT THE NIGHT, WOKE UP IN THE MORNING, WENT INTO A COMA. DEFINITELY HAVE OUR CONCERN -- HAVE MY CONCERNS. YOU COME UP HERE AND SPEND THE NIGHT. YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU WAKE UP? ANYWAY, IT'S ALL PART OF CLIMBING EVEREST. Narrator: ADVANCED BASE CAMP -- NEARLY FOUR PAINFUL MILES ABOVE SEA LEVEL. FOR MORE THAN A MONTH, THIS IS HOME SWEET HOME. THIS SEASON THERE ARE MORE THAN 600 CLIMBERS, THE MOST EVER. EACH WAITS FOR THE TWO-WEEK WEATHER WINDOW TO OPEN THE WAY TO THE SUMMIT. MMM. OKAY. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. HERE'S COFFEE. OH, THANK YOU. Man: NICE START TO THE DAY. Man: MORNING, MAX. MORNING. ABC, 21,000 FEET -- MY HOME AWAY FROM HOME. ALMOST THERE, MA. TAKE A LOOK. UP THERE, THERE'S THE SUMMIT. IT'S A LITTLE CLOUDY, BUT YOU CAN KIND OF SEE IT A LITTLE BIT. Narrator: TIM AND BRETT HAVE CARVED A PIECE OF PRIME REAL ESTATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CONTINGENT. I'M IN THE AMERICAN GHETTO RIGHT NOW. WE GOT TWO TENTS, TWO AMERICANS SIDE BY SIDE, AND WE'RE NEXT TO THE FREEWAY HERE. IT'S THE SHERPA TRAIL ON THEIR WAY UP AND DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING. Tim: USA, BABY! THAT'S MY NOISY NEIGHBOR TIM. I GOT NEIGHBORS, RIGHT? Narrator: EX-HELLS ANGEL TIM MEDVETZ CUSTOMIZES HOGS FOR THE HOLLYWOOD A-LIST. ALMOST KILLED BY A CYCLE CRASH, HIS BROKEN BONES HAVE BARELY MENDED WHEN HE JOINS THE TEAM AT KATHMANDU. I'VE HAD TO CALL THE COPS ON HIM A COUPLE TIMES ALREADY. THAT'S BRETT OVER THERE. HE'S MY NEIGHBOR. HE'S BUILDING THIS OUTLANDISH CONDO OVER THERE. Tim: THERE'S MY MATTRESS, MY VITAMINS. THAT'S MY LITTLE KITCHEN AREA AND MY KNIFE HANGING ON THE CEILING. YOU GOT TO HAVE A KNIFE. THE PLACE IS JUST A CESSPOOL. IT'S A MESS. MMM, BACON SANDWICH, A LITTLE SALAMI, AND CANDY BARS. SPEAKING OF CESSPOOL, THE URINAL'S LIKE 5 FEET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIM. I'M THINKING ABOUT PUTTING THE PLACE UP FOR SALE. YOU GOT TO CUT YOUR LOSES AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE WHILE YOU CAN. Narrator: THE FIVE-DAY CLIMB TO THE SUMMIT LEADS FROM THEIR CURRENT POSITION AT ABC VIA OVERNIGHT STOPS AT CAMPS 1 TO 4. BUT NO ONE'S GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL SHERPAS RIG OVER THREE MILES OF SAFETY ROPES TO THE SUMMIT. 6 BOYS, 1,200 METERS OF ROPE. THERE'S 200 METERS APIECE, SO THEY HAVE 2 COILS EACH. IT'S AMAZING, HUH? Narrator: RUSSELL'S OLD FRIEND AND HEAD SHERPA IS PHURBA. HE ACTUALLY MAKES MORE DECISIONS THAN I DO. PHURBA AND I FIRST WERE FIXING ROPES TOGETHER IN THE OLD DAYS. YOU ALWAYS USED TO LEAVE THE ROPE WITH ME LAST, BAD BOY. PHURBA AND THE CREW CARRY ALMOST HALF THEIR BODY WEIGHT WORTH OF ROPES AND GEAR TO THE SUMMIT. OH, THAT'S HEAVY. THESE ARE NOT BOYS. THESE ARE SUPERMEN. Russell: HOW'D YOU LIKE TO GO TO THE SUMMIT WITH THAT? NO, THANK YOU. THAT'S HEAVY. I'M GONNA TURN THE OXYGEN ON BEFORE I COLLAPSE. Narrator: IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR ONE SHERPA TO LOAD A HALF-DOZEN OXYGEN BOTTLES IN HIS BACKPACK, WHILE OTHERS HOIST COILS OF SAFETY ROPE. Mogens: THESE ARE THE REAL HEROES OF THE MOUNTAIN, THE SPINE OF EVERY EXPEDITION. Russell: I'M CONCERNED ABOUT EVERYONE BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE MY FAMILY, YOU KNOW. IT'S LIKE HAVING SIX SONS GOING TO THE SUMMIT TODAY. SO I'M INCREDIBLY WORRIED ABOUT THESE PEOPLE. Narrator: WHERE THEY'RE GOING, NO ONE CAN COME TO THE RESCUE. AFTER ONE SHERPA DEATH THIS SEASON, RUSSELL CAN'T STOP WORRYING. Russell: BE SAFE. Narrator: THE INDIAN CLIMBER HAS REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS. BUT HIS NEAR DEATH SHOWS EVERYONE HOW EVEREST CAN KILL. HE SUFFERS THE EFFECTS OF HIGH-ALTITUDE CEREBRAL EDEMA. HIS BRAIN HAS SWOLLEN SO MUCH, HIS EYES BULGE, AND HE'S ON THE VERGE OF MULTIPLE ORGAN FAILURE. I'M JUST GLAD HE LOOKS MUCH, MUCH BETTER THAN YESTERDAY. Brett: TO SEE A BIG EXPEDITION COME UP HERE LIKE THAT AND BE SO TOTALLY UNPREPARED TO DO RESCUE ON ONE OF THEIR OWN MEMBERS -- THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY OXYGEN. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY MEDS. I MEAN, IF IT WASN'T FOR RUSSELL, THAT GUY WOULD BE DEAD. FOLLOW FINGER DOWN. Terry: THANKFULLY WE HAD THE RIGHT RESOURCES. CERTAINLY IF HE HAD STAYED UP THERE MUCH LONGER, HE WOULD HAVE DIED. YEAH, THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND. LOOK UP. HE'S STABLE HERE, BUT ALWAYS GET BETTER IF YOU GO DOWN. WELL, THERE ARE THREE REMEDIES -- DESCENT, DESCENT, AND DESCENT. Narrator: THE CLIMB DOWN FROM ABC STARTS NEARLY FOUR MILES ABOVE SEA LEVEL. THE ATMOSPHERE HERE IS TOO THIN FOR HELICOPTERS. SO IT'S UP TO SHERPAS TO MEDEVAC THE VICTIM FOOT BY FOOT DOWN 14 MILES OF ROCKY TRAILS. Bill: I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY THAT HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE, THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE HAVE -- AND THEN, IF SOMETHING DOES GO WRONG, THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY EVACUATE SOMEBODY TO KATHMANDU IN ABOUT 18 HOURS, WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH UNHEARD OF. Narrator: AS THE MAN DISAPPEARS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN, TIM WONDERS IF HIS DAYS AT ABC ARE NUMBERED. Tim: ANOTHER BAD NIGHT. IT'S PROBABLY THE WORST I'VE HAD LAST NIGHT -- BRUTAL. I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA JUST COUGH UP MY WHOLE FRICKIN' -- ALL MY ORGANS INSIDE. [ COUGHING ] Narrator: HIS COUGH IS SO VIOLENT, HE COULD CRACK HIS RIBS. WHILE TIM BATTLES BRONCHITIS, THE SHERPAS CONTINUE THEIR STRUGGLE TO FIX SAFETY LINES TO THE TOP OF THE WORLD. TO GET THERE, PHURBA AND THE MEN MUST PENETRATE THE DEATH ZONE, A HIGH-ALTITUDE KILLING GROUND AT 26,000 FEET. Terry: WHAT DOES THE DEATH ZONE MEAN? I THINK, GENERALLY SPEAKING, IT'S A PLACE THAT THE HUMAN BODY COULD NOT SURVIVE FOR VERY LONG. YOU DO NOTHING BUT BREAK DOWN OUR OWN TISSUE. WE'RE DOING NOTHING BUT STARVING, AND THERE'S ONLY SO LONG THAT WE CAN DO THAT. DO I THINK STAYING UP IN THE DEATH ZONE FOR MORE THAN A COUPLE DAYS IS A GOOD IDEA? NO, PROBABLY NOT. Narrator: SHORT AND WIRY, SHERPAS ARE EVOLVED TO LIVE AT HIGH ALTITUDE. THEIR HEARTS ARE MORE EFFICIENT THAN WESTERNERS', AND THEIR BLOOD ABSORBS MORE OXYGEN. BUT EVEN THEY CAN EASILY PERISH IN THE DEATH ZONE, WHERE TEMPERATURES DROP TO 40 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. IF THE MOUNTAIN TURNS ON THEM HERE, ALL RUSSELL CAN DO IS WATCH THEM DIE. Russell: I'M VERY, VERY ANXIOUS FOR THESE BOYS. THEY'RE DOING A HARD, DANGEROUS JOB, AND THINGS CAN GO WRONG EASILY. Narrator: EXPEDITION SHERPAS ATTEMPT SOMETHING NEVER DONE SO EARLY IN THE EVEREST SEASON -- LAYING A SAFETY LINE TO THE SUMMIT ON THE LAST DAY OF APRIL. SO, THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH ON TIME TO BE ON THE SUMMIT PROBABLY ABOUT 1:00 TODAY. Narrator: THE SHERPAS WILL FIX OVER 17,000 FEET OF LINE TO THE MOUNTAIN. IT'S A LONG WAY FOR THEM TO COME DOWN, SO STILL WORRY A LOT NOW. [ MAN LAUGHS ] YEAH, HI, PHURBA. PRETTY EMOTIONAL TIME FOR THEM. I'M PRETTY PROUD OF THEM. I'M SURE THEY'RE PROUD. YOU WANT US TO SEND SOME TEA UP FOR YOU GUYS? [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: A FEW HOURS LATER, PHURBA REPORTS HIS TEAM HAS PASSED SAFELY DOWN THE DEATH ZONE AND ARE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO ABC. DO YOU KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN WHEN YOU ASK THEM SOMETHING ABOUT IT? THEY'LL SMILE AT YOU AND NOD. Mogens: YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE OLD R.E.M. SONG WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT STANDING AT THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS. THE GIANTS ARE UP NEAR THE SUMMIT NOW. WE'RE JUST DWARFS. THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. HOW COME YOU ALWAYS EXPRESS YOURSELF SO WELL? DON'T KNOW. I'M A ROMANTIC GUY. YOU'RE A ROMANTIC GUY, ARE YOU? [ COUGHING ] Narrator: BUT TIM'S IN TOO MUCH PAIN TO CELEBRATE. TO HEAL HIS BRONCHITIS, THE MOTORCYCLE DESIGNER DESCENDS 14 MILES LOWER TO BASE CAMP, WHERE THE AIR IS THICKER. IT'S PRETTY WARM DOWN THERE, FROM WHAT I HEAR. SO I'VE GOT MY BATHING SUIT AND MY SUNTAN LOTION IN HERE. I'M SORRY THAT IT'S COME TO THIS. BUT, I MEAN, HE'S BEEN SUFFERING FOR THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS. Narrator: TIM'S FALLEN BEHIND THE TEAM, AND AS THE GATEKEEPER, RUSSELL DOUBTS HE'LL MAKE THE SUMMIT ATTEMPT. Russell: BUT THEN AGAIN, TIM'S ALL OUT OF SEQUENCE, SO HE'S NOT PLAYING VERY HARD TO TRY AND GET INTO SEQUENCE. HE'S ALWAYS, EVERY SINGLE DAY, NOT GONE ON THE DAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE WENT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS GAME IS. HOW ARE YOU DOING? [ COUGHING ] BETTER THAN YOU. HE'S A LOSS TO YOU GUYS, NOT TO ME. SEE YOU FOR THE SUMMIT PUSH, BROTHER. HAVE A GOOD WALK DOWN. I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, HE'S A LOT OF HARD WORK FOR ME TO GET HIM TO THE SUMMIT AND BACK DOWN. TERRY, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING. Terry: TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF ON THE WAY DOWN. BE SAFE. BE SAFE UP THERE. MAX, LATER. Narrator: THIS SEASON, THE WEATHER ON EVEREST IS THE BEST IN LIVING MEMORY, AND RUSSELL IS TEMPTED TO START THE SUMMIT PUSH TWO WEEKS EARLY. THEY PUT IT ALL INTO A COMPUTER MODEL AND PUMP IT ALL OUT AND GIVE IT TO ME IN A LITTLE, SIMPLE GRAPH. YOU GOT TO READ THAT AND ALSO WHAT'S HAPPENING OUTSIDE. Narrator: RUSSELL IS A WEATHER JUNKIE. HE CHECKS THE FORECAST EVERY SIX HOURS, BUT NOT FOR KICKS. AN UNEXPECTED WIND OR DROP IN TEMPERATURE COULD KILL HIS TEAM IF THEY'RE CAUGHT IN THE OPEN. WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF FAITH IN THIS TECHNOLOGY. Narrator: SO RUSSELL GETS THE BEST HIGH-TECH WEATHER REPORTS MONEY CAN BUY, AND WHAT THEY'RE TELLING HIM NOW IS PRICELESS. SO, THIS LINE HERE IS THE SUMMIT, AND WE'RE LOOKING AT SUMMIT DAY ON THE 12th AND 13th. THAT GIVES LESS US WIND, AND THEN AS WE GET BACK DOWN OFF THE MOUNTAIN, IT GOES UP AGAIN DURING THE NIGHT, AND THEN THE NEXT DAY, IT DROPS DOWN AGAIN AS WE GO TO THE SUMMIT. Bill: SO, THEY'RE ALL SINGLE DIGITS, DOUBLE DIGITS A LITTLE BIT. Shaun: THAT'S PERFECT. Narrator: THE REPORT PREDICTS FIVE CLEAR DAYS FOR THE SUMMIT PUSH IN TWO WEEKS' TIME. RUSSELL'S ORIGINAL PLAN WAS TO SUMMIT IN A MONTH, BUT HE'S CONVINCED HIS TEAM CAN BE READY FOR AN EARLY WINDOW. Russell: WELL, IT'S ALWAYS A GAMBLE, BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WEATHER FORECAST FOUR OR FIVE DAYS AWAY. OF COURSE IT'S A GAMBLE. Narrator: THE STAKES ARE HIGH. THE CLIMBERS MUST PUSH THEIR BODIES HARDER TO ACCLIMATE IN TWO WEEKS INSTEAD OF FOUR. 12 EXPEDITION SHERPAS MUST DELIVER TWO TONS' WORTH OF GEAR TO THE FOUR HIGHER CAMPS ON THE WAY TO THE SUMMIT, ALL IN TWO SHORT WEEKS. SO WILL YOU GET OXYGEN LOADS FOR TOMORROW? Russell: NOW WE'VE GOT 130-SOMETHING BOTTLES OF OXYGEN TO SHIFT, AND 90 TENTS. THE FASTER WE CAN GET THAT UP, THE FASTER WE CAN GET UP ON THE MOUNTAIN. Narrator: NO OTHER EXPEDITION LEADER CAN MATCH RUSSELL'S EXPERIENCE AND WEATHER SAVVY. SO THE SECOND RUSSELL'S TEAM DEPARTS ABC FOR THE SUMMIT, LESS-EXPERIENCED GROUPS WILL FOLLOW. IF THE COMPETING EXPEDITIONS JUMP AHEAD OF RUSSELL'S, HIS CLIMBERS COULD BE CAUGHT IN A DEATH ZONE TRAFFIC JAM. THIS IS PART OF THE LOGISTICS ON THE MOUNTAIN. YOU LOOK AROUND THIS CAMP, THERE'S 600-SOMETHING PEOPLE ALL WANTING TO GO TO THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT EVEREST. Narrator: RUSSELL'S CLIENTS MUST PROVE THEY'RE TECHNICALLY COMPETENT AND HAVE CLIMBED AT LEAST 24,000 FEET. BUT STANDARDS ARE NOT AS HIGH ON OTHER EXPEDITIONS, AND RUSSELL'S NOT THE ONLY LEADER WORRIED ABOUT THE CLIMB AHEAD. I DON'T WANT TO PUT, LIKE, A BAD FEELING OVER THE CAMP, BUT I GOT A FEELING THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME BAD THINGS HAPPEN THIS YEAR 'CAUSE THERE'S JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE ON THE MOUNTAIN. Narrator: IT TAKES 10 LONG HOURS FOR TIM TO GO 14 MILES DOWN TO LOWER BASE CAMP, WHERE THE AIR CONTAINS 30% MORE OXYGEN. OH, MAN, YOU GUYS ARE BRUTAL. YOU GUYS ARE LIKE THE PAPARAZZI. Tim: I GOT BACK AROUND 8:00 AT NIGHT AND COUGHING, HACKING. SHE'S THROWING EVERYTHING AT ME, EVERYTHING. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE, RIGHT? Narrator: BUT UNLESS TIM CAN HEAL HIMSELF SOON, HIS SUMMIT DREAM WILL END ON THE BUS BACK TO KATHMANDU. MOUNT EVEREST IS 5 1/2 MILES HIGH, THE CRUISING ALTITUDE OF JUMBO JETS. BUT FOR ALL ITS SIZE, THE FINAL TRAIL TO THE TOP IS BARELY WIDE ENOUGH FOR ONE MAN TO PASS AT A TIME. I RECKON YOU CAN PROBABLY PUT ABOUT 60 PEOPLE A DAY UP ON THE SIDE. IF YOU'VE GOT LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE HOGGING THE ROPES AND GOING SLOWLY, THEN THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM. Narrator: NOT LONG AGO, RUSSELL WOULD KNOW EVERY GUIDE AND LEADER HERE BY NAME. BUT THOSE DAYS ARE GONE. THERE'S SO MANY TEAMS HERE, THEY'VE ALL BLENDED INTO EACH OTHER. AND I REALLY, REALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO'S WHO. Narrator: IT'S CRUCIAL THE PLAN TO SUMMIT EARLY IS KEPT SECRET FROM THE OTHER EXPEDITIONS. Russell: I'M NERVOUS, VERY NERVOUS, BECAUSE TELL OTHER PEOPLE, THEN EVERYONE COMING WITH US, TELL NOBODY, THEN WE HAVE THE MOUNTAIN TO OURSELF. JUST JUGGLING AROUND A LITTLE BIT AND UTILIZING THE WEATHER AND THE TIMING OF USING THE SHERPAS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO MAKE IT LOOK AS THOUGH WE'RE A LITTLE BIT CALM HERE AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LAZY. Narrator: RUSSELL ACTS LIKE A LAID-BACK LEADER TO FOOL THE COMPETITION. YEAH, BILL? MEANWHILE HE'S RUSHING SHERPA TEAMS UP THE MOUNTAIN WITH SUPPLIES. SO, WE MUST GET CAMP 2 AND CAMP 3 AND AS MUCH OXYGEN, EVERYTHING UP. ONE FIRST AID KIT AND ONE SPARE MASK AND REGULATOR AND SPARE OXYGEN AT EACH CAMP SO IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, YOU CAN GET FROM EACH CAMP DOWN. BUT LET'S GET THAT CAMP BEFORE OTHER PEOPLE DO. THE CLIMBERS WILL START THEIR SUMMIT ATTEMPT IN FOUR DAYS AND MUST PREPARE THEIR BODIES. THEY CLIMB UP FROM ABC TO ACCLIMATE OVERNIGHT AT CAMP 1, NORTH COL. IT'S A BACKBREAKING 2,000-FOOT VERTICAL TREK. RUSSELL WILL WATCH EACH MAN LIKE A HAWK TO DECIDE WHO WILL BE ALLOWED TO SUMMIT. SO, THERE ARE CUTOFF TIMES THAT WE START LOOKING AT TODAY, AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE PERFORMING A BIT BETTER THAN THEY HAVE ON MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER TRIPS. IF YOU'RE NOT AT NORTH COL BY 2:00 -- THAT'S FIVE HOURS. IF YOU'RE NOT UP THERE IN FIVE HOURS, YOU'RE NOT DOING TOO WELL. Woman: WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME? Narrator: ACCLIMATION HAS NOW RAISED EACH MAN'S RED BLOOD CELL COUNT BY 50% TO MAXIMIZE THEIR OXYGEN INTAKE. BUT THEY STILL FEEL SICK MOST OF THE TIME. Terry: IT'S PRETTY AMAZING WHAT THE BODY CAN DO TO ADJUST FOR OUR SILLY BEHAVIOR OF DECIDING TO COME UP HERE AND LIVE WHERE THERE'S 50% OF THE OXYGEN THAT WE HAVE AT SEA LEVEL. TA-DA! FOR MY NEXT TRICK, I WILL VOMIT INTO THE SNOW. CARRYING A BIG LOAD TODAY. HOPEFULLY THAT DOESN'T KICK MY BUTT TOO BAD. IT'S PROBABLY 35 POUNDS. Narrator: AT 9:00 A.M., RUSSELL AND BILL, HIS HEAD GUIDE, SCORE THE CLIMBERS AS THEY STRUGGLE UP. THIS IS BRUTAL. YOU KNOW, YOU JUST CAN'T CATCH YOUR BREATH. IT'S KICKING MY BUTT MORE THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD. Narrator: BRETT CAN ALMOST FEEL RUSSELL'S EYES GLUED TO HIS BACK. THIS IS HIS SECOND ATTEMPT AT EVEREST. IF HE FAILS TO REACH NORTH COL IN TIME, BRETT COULD BE DROPPED FROM THE TEAM. I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA JUST BREEZE UP. WELL, I TAKE THAT BACK. Russell: IT'S MORE ABOUT THE MIND THAN IT IS ABOUT PHYSIQUE. MAYBE THAT'S PART OF THE THING WITH BRETT IS AT HOME HE'S ONE OF THE REAL TOUGH FIREMEN, BUT HERE HE'S JUST A MERE MORTAL. Narrator: TWO HOURS INTO BRETT'S CLIMB, MOGENS SETS OFF. BUT HE SOON PASSES THE FIREMAN FROM L.A. AND IS CATCHING UP WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM, INCLUDING CAMERAMAN MARK WHETU. Mark: CAN YOU TELL ME HOW FAST YOU'RE GOING? ABOUT 2 1/4 HOURS FROM ABC. SO, YOU DECIDED TO TAKE YOUR TIME TODAY. AH, IT HAPPENS. [ LAUGHS ] Russell: I THINK IT'S GREAT FOR MOGENS. HE'S READY TO ROLL. I THINK GET UP THERE AND BACK DOWN QUICK. YEAH. I FEEL CONFIDENT. Narrator: MOGENS IS A 30-YEAR-OLD SCHOOLTEACHER AND DENMARK'S ONLY PROFESSIONAL MOUNTAINEER IN A COUNTRY WITH NO MOUNTAINS. HIS EVEREST TRAINING INCLUDED TREKKING 10 MILES A DAY WITH 150 POUNDS OF WATER IN HIS PACK. MOGENS HAS CHRONIC ASTHMA BUT IS DETERMINED TO TEST HIMSELF AGAINST EVEREST WITHOUT BOTTLED OXYGEN. Mogens: I WOULD LIKE TO SEND OUT THE MESSAGE TO OTHER ASTHMATICS THAT EVEN THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT EVEREST IS WITHIN REACH AND POSSIBLE FOR AN ASTHMATIC -- WITHOUT OXYGEN, EVEN. Narrator: AS MOGENS AND THE OTHERS PUSH ON TO NORTH COL, TIM TRIES TO HEAL HIS LUNGS AT BASE CAMP 6,000 FEET BELOW. Tim: OH, NOW. LITTLE SLIGHT CASE OF BRONCHITIS. I'VE STARTED SOME ANTIBIOTICS. THAT'S ABOUT IT, THOUGH. KEEP A LOT OF FLUIDS IN YOU AND GRIN AND BEAR IT. Narrator: TIM MUST BEAT HIS BRONCHITIS, RETURN TO ADVANCE BASE CAMP, AND ACCLIMATIZE AT NORTH COL, JUST LIKE THE OTHER CLIMBERS, OR THE GATE WILL SLAM SHUT ON HIM. [ COUGHING ] FIVE MILES UP MOUNT EVEREST, EXPEDITION SHERPAS TAKE A POUNDING AS THEY READY HIGH CAMPS 2 AND 3. HEY, TASHI DELE! HOW ARE YOU? Narrator: IF PHURBA'S TEAM CAN BUILD ALL FOUR HIGH CAMPS TWO WEEKS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, RUSSELL'S CLIMBERS WILL BE ABLE TO BEAT THE OTHER TEAMS TO THE SUMMIT. IT'S A LOT OF HARD WORK FOR THE SHERPAS, AND WE'VE BEEN HERE AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING OUR BOLLOCKS OFF SINCE WE ARRIVED. WE CAN'T GO ANY FASTER. THE SHERPAS THAT FIXED THE ROPE HAVE BEEN HERE FOR OVER 45 DAYS NOW, WORKING, WORKING, WORKING ALL THE TIME. Narrator: RUSSELL'S PUSHING THE CLIMBERS, TOO, SENDING THEM UP TO THE NORTH COL TO ACCLIMATE AT 23,000 FEET IN HALF THE NORMAL TIME. Man: EVERYBODY'S GOT A BIT OF A HEAVIER LOAD TODAY, IT SEEMS LIKE, BOB. ONE OF THE BIGGEST SURPRISES IS A 62-YEAR-OLD FRENCHMAN. Russell: VERY FIT, STRONG MAN. THEN WE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE CANCER, AND I WAS PREPARED TO GIVE HIM HIS MONEY BACK, AND IT'S HIS DECISION TO GO AND HAVE THE OPERATION, THEN COME HERE. Narrator: TWO MONTHS AGO, GéRARD BOURRAT HAD A CANCEROUS KIDNEY REMOVED THROUGH HIS GUT INSTEAD OF HIS BACK TO ALLOW HIM TO CARRY MOUNTAIN GEAR. LET'S GO! I'M GLAD I'M GONNA BE THERE VERY SOON, AND I CAN LOOK FORWARD TO LAYING DOWN AND LISTENING TO OTHER PEOPLE COUGH AND SNORE. Narrator: MAX IS A LEBANESE BUSINESSMAN FROM WAR-TORN BEIRUT. MAX HAS SUMMITED THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS ON EVERY CONTINENT, AND HIS SIGHTS ARE NOW FOCUSED ON EVEREST. RUSSELL SEES MAX AS THE HYPERACTIVE TYPE. Russell: HE JUST HAS TO STOP RUNNING AROUND LIKE A DOG EVERYWHERE. HE DOESN'T HAVE TO PEE IN EVERY CORNER, YOU KNOW? Narrator: INSTEAD OF PACING HIMSELF, MAX IS STUCK IN HIGH GEAR. Russell: DESPITE ALL THESE OTHER THINGS, HE'S DONE ALL THE EASY ONES, BUT HE HASN'T REALLY LEARNED MOUNTAIN SENSE 'CAUSE HE NEEDS TO STOP BOUNCING OFF THE WALLS AND JUST CONSERVE HIS ENERGY AND THINGS LIKE THAT. GOT TO GET GOING. Man: THANKS, MAX. Narrator: MOGENS REACHES NORTH COL NEARLY THREE HOURS UNDER RUSSELL'S FIVE-HOUR LIMIT. MAX, GéRARD, AND THE OTHERS SET OFF TWO HOURS BEFORE HIM BUT ARRIVE AFTER. ONLY ONE MAN IS MISSING. WHY IS THE LAST PART OF THE CLIMB IS ALWAYS THE STEEPEST? Man: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE ON MOUNT EVEREST, MATE. I'M FEELING IT. THIS IS KICKING MY BUTT, BUT THERE'S THE OBJECTIVE RIGHT UP THERE. Narrator: AT CAMP 1 ON NORTH COL, THE FIREMAN FINALLY APPEARS JUST FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE DEADLINE. Brett: I WAS BRINGING UP THE REAR. I FIGURED I'D CRUISE IN, NO PROBLEM, MAN. IT WAS COLD AND WINDY. OH, BABY. LUCKILY THE GUYS THAT HAD LEFT EARLY HAD ALREADY STARTED BREWING. BOILED SOME NOODLES AND SETTLED IN. Man: HOW WAS THE HIKE, BRETT? THE HIKE? PIECE OF CAKE, MAN. JUST FIGURED I'D COME UP HERE ALL BY MY LONESOME, BE THE LAST ONE INTO CAMP, MAKE SURE IT WAS NICE AND COLD AND SNOWING. BUT I MADE IT. HI. Man: HI. Narrator: AS THE TEAM PREPARES TO RETURN TO ADVANCED BASE CAMP, PHURBA AND THE SHERPAS DROP DOWN FROM THE HIGHER CAMPS WITH SOME GOOD NEWS. Man: HEY, HUBBA, HUBBA. WELL DONE. Man: YOU THINK YOU'RE CLOSE NOW TO BEING READY? FEW MORE TRIPS? [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] RIGHT. HEY! [ INDISTINCT TALKING ON RADIO ] Narrator: PHURBA'S SUCCESS IS RADIOED DOWN TO RUSSELL AT ABC. SO, IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THAT UP TO THE TOP CAMP, WE'RE READY TO ROLL. Narrator: WITH THE HIGH CAMPS ALMOST READY, RUSSELL AND HIS GUIDES TOAST TO THE SHERPAS... [ INDISTINCT TALKING ] ...AND ASSESS EACH CLIMBER'S PERFORMANCE. Russell: SO, IF WE HAVE BRETT, MOGENS, AND TIM, AND TIM'S THE UNKNOWN CHARACTER HERE. Narrator: AS THE CLIMBERS RETURN FROM NORTH COL TO ABC, BIG TIM WANTS TO GET BACK IN THE GAME FROM BASE CAMP 4,000 FEET BELOW. Tim: IT'S KIND OF NICE DOWN HERE AT BASE CAMP, THOUGH, I GOT TO ADMIT, BUT YOUR MIND STARTS WANDERING, AND YOU START THINKING, "THE REST OF THE TEAM'S UP TOP. I'M DOWN HERE." BASE CAMP TO RUSS. COME IN. Narrator: TIM RADIOS RUSSELL, BEGGING FOR A SHOT AT NORTH COL SO HE CAN QUALIFY FOR THE SUMMIT PUSH. HEY, RUSS, JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM. I'M HEADING UP, FEELING GOOD. Haven't lost the cough yet, still got it. I'M GONNA JUST TAKE IT EASY COMING UP if that's good with you. IT'S YOUR DECISION. Man: WHO'S THAT? THAT'S TIM COMING BACK. I SPOKE TO TIM ON THE WAY UP AND SAID, "WELL, YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN OUT OF SEQUENCE." FIRST DAY WE GO UP, HE'S GOING TO SLEEP. WELL, COME ON, TIM, SHOW US THAT YOU CAN DO SOMETHING. IT SEEMS TO BE THE STORY OF MY LIFE. JUST MORE ODDS STACKED UP AGAINST ME. NEXT TIME WE'RE GOING UP, HE WANTS TO GO DOWN TO BASE CAMP. SO I SAID, "WELL, YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION. WE'RE GOING UP, AND YOU'RE GOING DOWN." THE WHOLE TEAM'S MOVING UP. I DON'T WANT TO FALL THAT FAR BEHIND. I THINK HE'S OFF THE MARK. AND BY THE TIME HE COMES BACK, HE'S GOING TO BE KNACKERED AGAIN. TRY AND STICK WITH THE PROGRAM. I DIDN'T HEAR NO BELL YET, SO... I'M GOING UP. Narrator: TIM'S DETERMINED TO PROVE HIMSELF. BUT TO RUSSELL, IT'S TOO LITTLE TOO LATE. Russell: I'M NOT REALLY PREPARED TO TAKE HIM. HE'S NOT IN THE TEAM. Narrator: TIM HAS LEFT THE OTHER CLIMBERS HIGH UP THE MOUNTAIN AND DROPPED DOWN TO LOWER BASE CAMP TO RECOVER FROM BRONCHITIS. Man: GOOD LUCK, MAN. NOW HE'S FEELING BETTER AND HEADS BACK TO ABC TO PLEAD WITH RUSSELL FOR A CHANCE AT THE SUMMIT. Tim: I HAVE A FULL STOMACH, ATE PRETTY WELL. ANYWAY, STILL GOT THE COUGH, BUT I'M WELL RESTED. TWO DAYS DOWN HERE AT 5,200 METERS DEFINITELY WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED. THE ONLY DRAG IS I GOT TO GO ANOTHER 14 MILES TO GET BACK UP TO THE REST OF THE CREW. DON'T COUNT ME OUT YET. BELL DIDN'T RING. WHEN I COME DOWN, I'LL SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. Man: SEE YOU, TIM. GOOD LUCK. Narrator: TIM HEADS UP TO CONVINCE RUSSELL TO LET HIM CLIMB AS HIS TEAMMATES DESCEND FROM CAMP 1 AT NORTH COL. [ COUGHING ] Max: I WONDER WHETHER WE'RE ALL ACCLIMATIZED TO DO THIS, BUT HOPEFULLY WITH FOUR DAYS' REST AT ABC WE'LL BE READY TO GET ON HIGHER. Narrator: THE CLIMBERS HAVE SHOCKED THEIR BODIES INTO PRODUCING MORE RED BLOOD CELLS, AND NOW THEY RETURN TO ADVANCED BASE CAMP TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS. AND THEN IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WAITING BEFORE BIG BOSS, RUSSELL BRICE, SAYS GO. Narrator: RUSSELL HAS STAKED HIS REPUTATION AND SUMMIT ATTEMPT ON A WEATHER WINDOW DUE TO OPEN ON THE 12th AND 13th OF MAY. Russell: BEEN LOOKING AT THE WEATHER. YEAH, I THINK I'M STILL ROLLING FOR THIS 12th, 13th. IT IS A GAMBLE. Narrator: BRETT IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO REACH ABC. BUT MARK IS STOPPED IN HIS TRACKS. Man: SO, TELL US YOUR STORY, MATE? BLOODY CLIENT'S BROKEN HIS LEG. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? Narrator: THIS IS ONE CLIMBING ACCIDENT RUSSELL CAN ENJOY. HAVE TO PULL ANOTHER ONE OUT OF THE BARREL. I'M JUST GOING TO PULL ANOTHER ONE OUT OF THE BARREL, TAKE A FEW NUTS AND BOLTS UP, AND STRAP IT ON AGAIN. Narrator: RUSSELL WILL SEND A SHERPA UP WITH A SPARE LEG FOR MARK. Russell: HE'S GOING TO GET A RIGHT LEG AND TAKE IT BACK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE FIXED ROPES. Man: WOULD YOU CONSIDER CARRYING A SPARE LEG FROM NOW ON? IN THE MEANTIME, MARK'S GOING TO HOP DOWN TO THE BOTTOM. BLOODY CLIENT. Brett: I DIDN'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO GO BACK UP AND HELP COWBOY AND BOB. YEAH, WE'VE GOT A BROKEN LEG IN THE TEAM. WHAT?! HE'S GOT A BROKEN LEG. [ LAUGHTER ] OH. YEAH. YOU HAD ME FOR A SECOND. I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, AND YOU STILL GOT ME. ALL RIGHT, I'M DELIRIOUS. I'M GONNA GO EAT. Narrator: MARK'S NOT THE ONLY WALKING WOUNDED HEADED FOR ADVANCED BASE CAMP. Tim: 30 MILES ROUND TRIP OVER ROCK AND ICE, 20,000 FEET WITH A CRACKED RIB. DOING GOOD, A LITTLE HUNGRY. YOU KNOW, IN MY OPINION, HE'S ALREADY MAKING HIS EXCUSES AS A NICE WAY OUT, THAT, "YEAH, THIS IS TOO HARD FOR ME." OR, "I CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE I'VE GOT THIS AND THAT AND THINGS." [ MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY ] YO, MY L.A. BROTHER. SOLD? ALL RIGHT. WHO SOLD MY TENT? I DON'T KNOW. PROBABLY RUSSELL. SON OF A BITCH. Brett: THERE'S MY NEIGHBOR TIM THAT I'M GOING TO SUE. I THINK I'M GOING TO START COURT PROCEEDINGS TOMORROW, ACTUALLY. HE'S ACTUALLY USING THE AMERICAN GHETTO COMMUNITY URINAL RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE. HEY, NEIGHBOR, HOW YOU DOING OVER THERE? YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT, PAL. HE'LL BE LONG GONE PRETTY SOON. Narrator: RUSSELL'S CREW HAS BEEN SNOOPING AROUND TO SEE WHAT THE OTHER EXPEDITIONS ARE UP TO. Russell: SEVEN SUMMITS. WHAT DAY? YEAH, JUST TELL ME THE OTHER TEAMS. YEP, OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GRAHAM. Narrator: NO ONE'S LEAVING FOR THE SUMMIT AS EARLY AS RUSSELL, AND NO ONE IS MORE PREPARED. THE RUMOR GOING AROUND IS EVERYONE'S THINKING THAT THEY'RE GOING EARLY. BUT YOU SEE MAX IS 15, VINCE IS 17, INDIAN -- 15. SEVEN SUMMITS I KNOW THAT ARE MUCH LATER BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT READY YET AND SO ON. THEY'VE GOT A SHITLOAD OF GEAR TO GET UP THE HILL. Narrator: THE TEAM'S SECRET SUMMIT DEPARTURE IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING, AND TIM MUST CONVINCE HIS SKEPTICAL LEADER HE'S GOT THE JUICE BY ACCLIMATING AT NORTH COL. SO, I'M GOING TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE TOMORROW. YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT, RIGHT? Russell: YEAH, ONE OF THE SHERPAS HAS GONE UP. I'LL MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT BY YOURSELF. I DON'T CARE. I ACTUALLY PREFER TO BE BY MYSELF. I'M HAPPY YOU GOING UP AND DOWN BY YOURSELF. NORTH COL, IF YOU CAN'T GO UP AND DOWN THERE, THEN YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO BE ON MY EXPEDITION. NO. NO WORRIES. GO TOMORROW. I'LL FIND SOMEONE TO BE UP THERE TOMORROW NIGHT. ALL RIGHT, BOSS. Russell: TIM -- HE'S A BIG BOY. HE SHOULD BE PLAYING RUGBY, NOT TRYING TO CLIMB MOUNTAINS. Tim: IT'S GONNA KILL ME. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? IT'S MOUNT EVEREST, MAN. GOT TO SUCK IT UP. GOT A GUY HERE WITH NO LEGS. WHAT AM I COMPLAINING ABOUT? Narrator: RUSSELL HAS TOTALLY WRITTEN TIM OFF, JUST LIKE THE SURGEONS DID AFTER A CYCLE CRASH ALMOST COST HIM HIS LEG. Tim: THE ACCIDENT -- WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THE DOCTORS TELLING YOU, YOU CAN'T DO THIS, YOU CAN'T DO THAT -- THAT'S WHAT MOTIVATES ME IF SOMEONE SAYS YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING. LITTLE BEHIND THE TEAM, SO TYPICAL TIM FASHION -- SOLO. NOT A TEAM PLAYER. I'M UP HERE PRETTY MUCH ALONE. [ COUGHING ] DEFINITELY GOT SOME CONCERNS. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME CATCHING MY WIND. LIKE, NOW'S A GOOD TIME FOR A BREAK. Narrator: WHILE TIM CATCHES HIS BREATH, RUSSELL TALKS OXYGEN DOWN AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP. THESE ARE VERY DANGEROUS. THIS IS THREE-LITER. THIS IS FOUR-LITER. THIS IS WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GONNA BE USING 'CAUSE IT'S MUCH HEAVIER. THE SHERPAS HAVE BEEN USING THESE LITTLE WIMPY ONES. THESE ARE FILLED TO AROUND ABOUT 500 BAR, PRESSURE, SO EFFECTIVELY IT'S A TIME BOMB. IT'S TRYING TO EXPLODE. IF YOU MIX ANY HYDROCARBON WITH HIGH-PRESSURE OXYGEN, IT WILL EXPLODE. LIP SALVE, BUTTER, CREAM ON THE TOP OF THIS THREAD YOU'LL BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF, OKAY? SO I SUGGEST THAT YOU DON'T DO THAT. Narrator: IN THE DEATH ZONE, THE BRAIN IS STARVED FOR OXYGEN. CLIMBERS HARDLY REMEMBER THEIR OWN NAMES, SO CHANGING THESE TANKS MUST BECOME SECOND NATURE. AH, IT'S QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HERE AT 21,000 FEET. I CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT CAN BE UP THERE WHERE YOU CAN BARELY THINK. Russell: HOW DOES THAT FEEL? DOES THAT FEEL OKAY? NOT TOO TIGHT, NOT TOO LOOSE. THERE IS A FACE UNDER HERE. HELLO. [ MAN GROANS ] [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: BUT THE O2 LESSON IS ACADEMIC TO MOGENS. HE'S A GENETIC FREAK -- BASICALLY BORN WITH FIVE LUNGS. Narrator: MOGENS PLANS TO SUMMIT WITHOUT BOTTLED OXYGEN. LESS THAN 100 CLIMBERS HAVE EVER ACHIEVED THIS FEAT, AND NONE OF THEM HAD ASTHMA. Mogens: IF YOU HAVE 100 PEOPLE STANDING ON THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST, 3% MAYBE 4% ARE HAVING DONE IT WITHOUT O's. SO, YEAH, ITS LIKE NIGHT AND DAY DOING IT WITH AND WITHOUT THE MASK. IT'S A SPECIAL CLUB. Narrator: 1,000 FEET ABOVE, TIM AND AN EXPEDITION SHERPA ARE NOW HALFWAY UP TO NORTH COL. Tim: RADIO. GOT A CIGARETTE? NO. NO? Narrator: TIM'S RéSUMé IS A LONG LIST OF CLOSE CALLS AND NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES. ONCE, IT WAS MOTORCYCLE CRASHES. NOW IT'S CROSSING BOTTOMLESS CREVASSES WITH A HACKING COUGH. BUT FOR TIM, THAT'S WHAT BEING ALIVE IS ABOUT. Tim: NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD THE CONCEPT OF SAVING UP YOUR WHOLE LIFE AND THEN SPEND IT WHEN YOU'RE OLD. YOUR LIFE CAN BE TAKEN FROM YOU LIKE THAT -- BOOM. Narrator: TIM REACHES CAMP 1 AT NORTH COL JUST UNDER THE QUALIFYING TIME OF FIVE HOURS. Tim: WHOO. I COULD EAT A BEAR. Narrator: RUSSELL IS RELIEVED TO SEE HIM BUT STILL CONVINCED THE 6'5" DAREDEVIL WILL BE A LIABILITY ON THE SUMMIT ATTEMPT JUST THREE DAYS AWAY. I GOT A LITTLE BIT OF STEAM LEFT IN ME, NOT MUCH, THOUGH. Narrator: RUSSELL IS CERTAIN TIM WILL HIT THE WALL AND DROP OUT OF THE EXPEDITION. Russell: I'D HOPE THAT WE CAN GET HIM TO CAMP 2, AS WELL, AND THEN HE DROPS OUT. AND I REALLY WOULD WANT HIM TO STRUGGLE AND PUSH HARD TO HIS LIMIT. IT'S BETTER FOR HIM TO MAKE THE DECISION AND FAIL ON HIS OWN. LET HIM BUILD IT UP AND MAKE HIS OWN CHOICE. AND HE KNOWS. I MEAN, IF IT TAKES HIM 8 OR 10 HOURS TO GET TO CAMP 2, HE'S GONNA KNOW IT'S DONE. THE ONLY PROBLEM I GOT RIGHT NOW IS AN EMPTY STOMACH. DINNER. Narrator: BUT HIGH UP AT CAMP 1 ON NORTH COL, TIM IS HIS OLD SELF AGAIN. WE'RE UP ON THE NORTH COL ON MOUNT EVEREST. WE'RE GONNA COOK SOME SOUP TODAY. FIRST, START OFF WITH A LITTLE WATER. THEN WE PUT A LITTLE NOODLE IN THERE, LITTLE CHILLI, LITTLE CHEESE. I LIKE TO CALL THIS MY NEW ORLEANS SHERPA SOUP. OH, YEAH. YEAH, VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD. RAM ROLL. RAM ROLL. STIR IT UP THERE. GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE BAM! NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK, AND WE'LL DIVVY IT UP HERE. BAM! Narrator: TIM LEAVES EVEREST'S NORTH COL CONVINCED HE WILL QUALIFY FOR THE SUMMIT ATTEMPT THREE DAYS AWAY. SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE RACE, SO HOPEFULLY THAT'LL BE THE OUTCOME OF THIS ONE. Narrator: BUT DOWN AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP, THE WEATHER THROWS RUSSELL A CURVE. A STORM HAS COME OUT OF NOWHERE AND SLAMS SHUT THE GATE. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN PUSH ME AROUND IS THE WEATHER, AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S DOING. Narrator: RUSSELL HAS DECIDED TO SEND TWO TEAMS TO THE SUMMIT ON SUCCESSIVE DATES, BUT NOW THE CLIMBS ARE BOTH DELAYED BY A DAY. WE'RE GOING TO THE SUMMIT THE 13th, 14th NOW. 14th THE WIND IS HERE, BUT THEN 15, 16, 17 THE WIND PICKS UP AGAIN AND GOES THROUGH A LEVEL THAT I'M NOT HAPPY WITH, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A WEEK IN ADVANCE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SITTING DOWN HERE IN THE NICE, COMFORTABLE ABC IN THE SUN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN FIVE, SIX DAYS' TIME UP ON THE MOUNTAIN. WHO WANTS THE GOOD NEWS AND THE BAD NEWS? BAD NEWS FIRST. BAD NEWS FIRST? IT'S GOING TO BE WINDY. BUT I NEED TO GET A BETTER FORECAST TODAY, SO WE'RE STILL BALANCING. SO HANG FIRE ONE MORE DAY, GUYS. Narrator: WHEN TIM LUMBERS INTO CAMP, THE ONE-DAY DELAY GIVES HIM 24 HOURS MORE TO REST. Man: HOW YOU DOING, BIG MAN? HEY, HEY, HEY. FEELING GOOD. HUNGRY AS USUAL. [ LAUGHS ] [ INDISTINCT TALKING ] Narrator: TIM'S HUMOR AND GUTS HAVE WON OVER THE SHERPAS, HIS FELLOW CLIMBERS, AND RUSSELL, IN SPITE OF HIMSELF. Russell: I LOVE HIM. I THINK HE'S A GREAT CHARACTER. IT'S NICE TO HAVE HIM HERE. Terry: AND HE RESPECTS YOUR STAFF, TOO. HE LOVES THEM, AND HE SPEAKS NEPALESE WITH THEM, AND THEY LOVE HIM BECAUSE OF THAT. 'CAUSE HE'S TOOLO. HE'S TOOLO YETI. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S TOOLO YETI. TOOLO YETI. Bill: YEAH, KICKING HIM OUT OF THE KITCHEN. "OUT OF MY KITCHEN!" Woman: HE'S A HUNGRY BOY. Man: HE'S ALWAYS HUNGRY. MMM. OH, MAN. THIS IS THE BEST EGGS AND POTATOES I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. GOOD TO BE BACK. Narrator: WHILE TIM FILLS HIS STOMACH, RUSSELL STUDIES THE LATEST FORECASTS. Russell: 19 DIFFERENT PICTURES AND MAPS AND CHARTS AND THINGS. NEED TO LOOK TO THAT TO CONFIRM, LET'S KEEP GOING. Narrator: TO MEET RUSSELL'S DEADLINE, THE SHERPAS RACE TO DELIVER SUPPLIES TO CAMP 4. THE SPOT'S SO STEEP, THEY HAVE TO CUT TRENCHES TO KEEP OXYGEN BOTTLES FROM SLIDING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. RUSSELL CAN ONLY HOPE THE SHERPAS WILL RETURN SAFELY IN TIME FOR THE NEW SUMMIT DAYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALL THESE BRIGHT LIGHTS. THE SHERPAS RETURN TO ABC AND CONFIRM THAT ALL HIGH CAMPS ARE READY. THE GATEWAY TO THE SUMMIT HAS BEEN PRIED BACK OPEN. Man: PHURBA, WHERE DID YOU GO? 8-3. IS THAT CAMP 4? CAMP 4. YEAH. Russell: THE WEATHER WAS GOOD, AND THE BOYS WERE GREAT, SO THESE BOYS CAN HAVE A BIT OF A REST TOMORROW. I'M THEIR BIGGEST FAN. IT'S OUT OF THIS WORLD. JUST BLOWS ME AWAY. I CAME OUT TO THANK THEM. THANK YOU. Narrator: ALL THE PIECES HAVE FALLEN TOGETHER. THE TEAM HAS ACCLIMATED IN HALF THE NORMAL TIME. AND THE SHERPAS HAVE PULLED OFF A NEAR MIRACLE. THE SUMMIT ATTEMPT IS NOW A GO IN JUST 12 HOURS. BUT ON EVEREST, 12 HOURS IS AN ETERNITY. NEXT TIME ON "EVEREST" -- RUSSELL'S DEMONS RETURN TO HAUNT HIM. IT'S DANGEROUS. IF IT GOES WRONG, IT GOES REALLY, REALLY WRONG. YOU CAN DIE. TO KEEP HIS AMBITIONS ALIVE, THE KING OF THE MOUNTAIN LAYS DOWN THE LAW. Russell: BUT, REMEMBER, ALSO, THEY ARE MERE MORTALS. IT'S NOT THEIR JOB TO DIE ALONGSIDE YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR AMBITIONS. Narrator: EACH STEP IS AN ETERNITY, EACH BREATH A BATTLE, AS EIGHT MEN PUSH THE LIMIT ON EVEREST. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS
