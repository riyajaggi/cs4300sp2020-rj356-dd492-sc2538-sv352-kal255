 Everest: Beyond the Limit (2006–…): Season 1, Episode 5 - Mutiny on the Mountain - full transcript 
 Team One have summited but the mountain is so crowded with other climbers that they get caught in yet another queue as they attempt to get down. It's turned into a marathon climb of nearly 18 hours with climbers suffering frostbite in the bitter cold. Now it's Team Two's turn at the summit and they set off two hours early in an attempt to beat the queues, but it means an extra two hours in the dark on one of the coldest days anyone can remember. Mark Inglis makes history as the first double amputee to summit, but two climbers who are struggling mutiny when Russell orders them to turn back.

 7:50 IN THE MORNING. 28,700 FEET. TIM MEDVETZ IS JUST 350 FEET FROM THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST AND STILL REFUSING ORDERS FROM EXPEDITION LEADER RUSSELL BRICE TO TURN BACK. TIM, YOU CAN'T CLIMB A MOUNTAIN ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES. NOW TURN AROUND. Narrator: WITH TIM IS 62-YEAR-OLD GéRARD BOURRAT AND HEAD SHERPA PHURBA, WHO'S URGING THE FRENCHMAN TO DESCEND. EXTREME ALTITUDE CAN AFFECT BRAIN FUNCTION, CAUSING SUMMIT FEVER, AN IRRATIONAL DRIVE TO REACH THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN EVEN IF IT MEANS ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH. ...AND COME DOWN SAFELY TODAY. Narrator: 8:00 A.M. AFTER A NINE-HOUR CLIMB, TIM COLLAPSES, TOO EXHAUSTED TO CARRY ON. NOW GET UP AND GET GOING. SO GET UP AND START WALKING. MISSED AN EXTRA HALF-HOUR. Narrator: TIM AND GéRARD ARE ON THE SUMMIT RIDGE. BUT TO REACH THE TOP, THEY HAVE TO TAKE A LONG DOGLEG TO THE RIGHT AND THEN CLIMB A STEEP, ROCKY SECTION 100 FEET HIGH. THEIR TEAMMATES, DOUBLE AMPUTEE MARK INGLIS AND HIS CLIMBING PARTNER, WAYNE "COWBOY" ALEXANDER, ARE NOW ON THEIR WAY DOWN FROM THE SUMMIT. LIKE TIM, COWBOY IS A BIKER. TO THE SUMMIT AND BACK. TO THE SUMMIT AND BACK. BUT NOW IT'S COWBOY'S JOB TO PERSUADE THE FORMER HELLS ANGEL TO QUIT. RUSSELL WATCHES EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING ON THE SUMMIT RIDGE FROM HIS BASE AT CAMP 1. THE SITUATION IS ALSO MONITORED 1 1/2 MILES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP. EXPEDITION DOCTOR TERRY O'CONNOR HAS JUST RETURNED AFTER SUMMITING YESTERDAY AND CHECKS OUT THE TOES HE THOUGHT WERE FROSTBITTEN. TOES ARE ALL GOOD. [ CHUCKLES ] I JUST HOPE TODAY TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT. HAVING JUST BEEN UP THERE YESTERDAY AND KNOWING WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE LIKE... YOU KNOW, A LONG DAY UP THERE IS A BAD DAY, NO MATTER WHAT. Narrator: BACK ON THE MOUNTAIN, RUSSELL HAS ONE FINAL CARD UP HIS SLEEVE. HE DIED BECAUSE HE DID NOT TURN AROUND IN TIME. I CAN'T DO MUCH ABOUT IT IF HE'S NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO US. Narrator: GéRARD IS STILL DETERMINED TO REACH THE SUMMIT, BUT COWBOY WON'T LET HIM. YEAH, COWBOY. GOOD FOR COWBOY. L.A. FIREMAN BRETT MERRELL AND ASTHMATIC MOGENS JENSEN HAVE ABANDONED THEIR OWN SUMMIT BIDS. BUT THEY REMAIN AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP TO SUPPORT THE OTHER CLIMBERS. Brett: THERE WAS A BIG PART OF ME THAT REALLY WANTED HIM TO SUMMIT, I GOT TO ADMIT. HE'S GOT SO MUCH DAMN HEART. YEAH. BUT WE ALL KNOW THE SCORE, MAN. I DON'T KNOW. I JUST... HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE ANY REASONING SKILLS RIGHT NOW. Narrator: FRESH OXYGEN BOTTLES HAVE BEEN LEFT AT MUSHROOM ROCK 600 FEET BELOW. BUT IT WILL TAKE THEM NEARLY THREE HOURS TO GET THERE, AND RUSSELL'S WORRIED GéRARD WON'T MAKE IT. Russell: IF YOU'RE A SHERPA, THEY COULD RUN DOWN ON WHAT HE'S GOT LEFT IN HIS CYLINDER FROM WHERE THEY ARE NOW AND GET TO MUSHROOM ROCK, BUT I'M SURE HE CAN'T. Narrator: UNTIL SOMEONE CAN GET TIM MOVING, HE'S PLACING OTHER CLIMBERS IN DANGER. TIM'S STALLED AT THE TOP OF A 10,000-FOOT CLIFF. TO GET PAST HIM, OTHER CLIMBERS HAVE TO UNCLIP FROM THE SAFETY ROPE AND CLIP BACK IN AGAIN. ONE SLIP DURING THIS MANEUVER MEANS CERTAIN DEATH. YOU ARE SO LAZY. THE DRAMA IS CAPTURED ON A HELMET CAMERA WORN BY PHURBA TASHI. HE'S BEEN RUSSELL'S CHIEF SHERPA FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS. PHURBA'S SUMMITED 10 TIMES BEFORE, AND HE'S NOW TIM AND GéRARD'S BEST HOPE OF SURVIVAL. TO GET TIM MOVING, PHURBA TURNS UP HIS OXYGEN FLOW. IT GIVES TIM AN ENERGY BOOST BUT ALSO INCREASES THE RISK HE'LL RUN OUT OF OXYGEN BEFORE GETTING TO MUSHROOM ROCK. CANCER SURVIVOR GéRARD, THE FRENCH MOUNTAINEER, REFUSES TO MOVE UNTIL HE'S TAKEN PICTURES FOR THE DOCTORS WHO MADE HIS TRIP POSSIBLE. AT -20 DEGREES, GéRARD RISKS SEVERE FROSTBITE BY TAKING HIS GLOVE OFF. TIM GOES AROUND GéRARD. IF HE FALLS, HE'S DEAD. IT'S 8:30 A.M. RUSSELL BRICE HAS HAD TWO HOURS' SLEEP IN THE LAST 36, FIGHTING A LIFE-AND-DEATH BATTLE TO SAVE CLIMBERS TIM AND GéRARD. PHURBA, PHURBA, HE HAS TO GET UP AND WALK. CHIEF SHERPA PHURBA IS DESPERATE TO GET THE TWO MEN MOVING. HE CAN SEE TIM STARTING TO FALL ASLEEP -- THE FIRST SIGNS OF SEVERE HYPOTHERMIA. BUT TIM AND GéRARD ARE NOT RUSSELL'S ONLY PROBLEM. MARK INGLIS HAS STRUGGLED PASSED THEM ON HIS WAY DOWN FROM THE SUMMIT, AND HIS ARTIFICIAL LEGS ARE NOW CAUSING HIM AGONIZING PAIN. DESPITE HIS STUMPS BEING RUBBED RAW, MARK MUST KEEP WALKING BECAUSE A RESCUE THIS HIGH UP IS IMPOSSIBLE. 500 FEET BELOW, MAX CHAYA MAKES GOOD PROGRESS TOWARDS CAMP 4. MAX HAS PROVED TO BE ONE OF THE STRONGEST CLIMBERS ON THE EXPEDITION. HE SUMMITED AT DAWN AND IS WAY AHEAD OF THE TEAM, WHEN HE SUDDENLY STOPS AND MAKES A FATEFUL RADIO CALL. Russell: YEAH, MAX. Max: OVER. CAN HE TALK AT ALL? CAN YOU GET HIS OXYGEN BACK ON? YEAH, I MEAN IF HE'S -- HAS IT GOT OXYGEN FLOWING, MAX? YEAH, MAX, YOU CAN TRY GIVING HIM YOUR OXYGEN. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT GOING TO GET HIM DOWN THE HILL. YEAH, MAX. I KNOW IT'S HARD. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHERE DO WE GET ANY HELP? ...FUTURE TO CARRY HIM DOWN AND GET HIM DOWN. ...JUST WALK ON. OVER. [ HISSING ] Brett: MAX IS A -- HE'S A GOOD MAN. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SIT DOWN HERE ON MY ASS AT 21,000 FEET. THOSE GUYS ARE UP THERE 28,000, JUST BARELY HANGING ON, AND THEN THEY COME ACROSS SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YEAH, MAX IS A HERO. HE'S A GOOD MAN. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TEAM HE'S FROM, NOTHING, AND OBVIOUSLY HIS TEAM MEMBERS ARE NOT TAKING ANY CARE FOR HIM. IT'S TOUGH FOR MAX. Max: [ SOBS ] IT'S TOUGH. I WOULD, TOO. Narrator: IT'S BEEN 10 MINUTES SINCE MAX FOUND THE DYING MAN IN THE DEATH ZONE. NOW EXPEDITION GUIDE WOODY ADDS TO THE DRAMA. I'M SORRY, MAX. YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH, MAN. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T DO MUCH WITH HIM. [ SIGHS ] BOY, THAT'S GOT TO BE TOUGH FOR MAX. Max: OKAY, RUSS. OKAY. YEAH, MAX. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY IT'S SO HARD. BUT WE CAN'T DO MUCH, MAN. Narrator: IT'S 11:30 ON MAY 15th. MAX HAS JUST HAD TO LEAVE AN UNKNOWN CLIMBER TO DIE BECAUSE NO ONE HAS THE MANPOWER TO SAVE HIM. THE TRAGEDY HAS DIVERTED ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE CRISIS OF GéRARD AND TIM, WHO BATTLE FOR THEIR LIVES AT OVER 28,000 FEET. GéRARD REFUSED TO DESCEND WHEN RUSS TOLD HIM TO. NOW HE IS STRUGGLING TO GET DOWN OUT OF THE DEATH ZONE. IT'S NOT JUST GéRARD'S LIFE AT STAKE. THE SHERPAS PLACE THEIR OWN LIVES IN DANGER JUST TRYING TO KEEP HIM MOVING. Russell: I CAN SEE YOU SITTING THERE. Narrator: GéRARD'S GETTING WORSE BY THE MINUTE, AND THEY'RE STILL 2,000 FEET INSIDE THE DEATH ZONE. THEY HAVE NOW CLIMBED 12 HARD HOURS AND STILL HAVE ANOTHER SIX TO GO, AS LONG AS THEY KEEP MOVING. TIM IS FURTHER DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. BUT AS HYPOTHERMIA SETS IN, HE'S GETTING EVER MORE LETHARGIC. HE SLIPS OFF THE TRACK, AND ONLY THE SAFETY ROPES LAID BY THE SHERPAS SAVE HIM. THE EFFORT OF CRAWLING BACK JUST DRAINS MORE ENERGY TIM DESPERATELY NEEDS TO KEEP GOING. Russell: YOU NEED THIS ENERGY TO GET BACK DOWN OFF THE MOUNTAIN. SMALLER MOUNTAINS, YOU CAN JUST WALK DOWN AND IT GETS EASIER, BUT YOU HAVE TO GET A LONG WAY DOWN EVEREST BEFORE IT STARTS GETTING EASIER. Narrator: AND IF YOU DO SIT DOWN HERE, YOU MIGHT NEVER GET UP AGAIN. IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS, YOU KNOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF DEATHS OR BAD ACCIDENTS HAPPEN ON THE DESCENT. YOU'RE AT THE END OF A LONG DAY, THE WEATHER MAY BE SPOILING, YOUR JUDGMENT MAY BE POOR WHILE YOU'RE UP THERE -- THINGS LIKE THAT. AND SO THERE'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER, REALLY, ON DESCENT. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] YOU GOT A 240-POUND GUY WITH POOR MOBILITY, HYPOXIC, RUNNING OUT OF OXYGEN, STUMBLING. IF HE WOULD'VE MADE IT TO THE SUMMIT, HE WOULD'VE TOOK SOME PICTURES UP THERE, FLEW HIS FLAG, AND DIED ON THE WAY DOWN. Narrator: TIM AND GéRARD MAKE IT TO MUSHROOM ROCK AND FRESH SUPPLIES OF OXYGEN. BUT THEIR ORDEAL IS FAR FROM OVER. THEY MUST DESCEND AT LEAST ANOTHER 2,200 FEET BEFORE THEY'RE LOW ENOUGH TO SLEEP IN RELATIVE SAFETY. AS MAX AND HIS SHERPA ARRIVE AT CAMP 4, HE KNOWS IT'S NOW LITTLE MORE THAN A PIT STOP. THE ONLY ONE THERE IS HIGH-ALTITUDE DIRECTOR JEN PEEDOM. MAX MAY BE SAFELY DOWN, BUT HIS THOUGHTS ARE UP ON THE MOUNTAIN. THERE ARE ALMOST 200 DEAD BODIES ON ITS SLOPES, MANY IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE CLIMBERS. EACH YEAR, THAT NUMBER GROWS. [ BLOWS NOSE ] Narrator: AS MAX SPEAKS, PHURBA AND GéRARD PASS THE DYING CLIMBER. PHURBA SPENDS 25 PRECIOUS MINUTES TRYING TO HELP THE SEMICONSCIOUS MAN. BUT HIS PRIORITY HAS TO BE TO KEEP GéRARD MOVING. HAVING DONE WHAT HE CAN, HE MOVES HIM ON TOWARDS CAMP 4. AT LEAST MAX'S DAY IS CLOSE TO AN END. BUT HIS MIND IS BURDENED KNOWING TIM AND GéRARD REMAIN IN DANGER. GéRARD IS WITHIN SIGHT OF THE TENTS AT CAMP 4, BUT AFTER 13 HOURS, HE'S IN BIG TROUBLE. HIS HANDS AND FEET HAVE LOST ALL FEELING -- THE FIRST SIGNS OF FROSTBITE. AS MAX STARTS DOWN TOWARD CAMP 3, THE WALKING WOUNDED BEGIN TO ARRIVE AT CAMP 4. BOB KILLIP, WHO LEFT HERE 12 HOURS AGO, HAS OVERCOME LONG DELAYS IN SOME OF THE COLDEST SUMMIT WEATHER ON RECORD. BOB SUMMITED WITH MARK AND COWBOY, WHO ARRIVE NEXT. [ COUGHING ] Narrator: JUST YARDS AWAY, TIM MAKES A CRASH LANDING AT CAMP 4. [ COUGHING ] Jen: COME ON, TIM! YOU CAN DO IT! Terry: EVERYTHING IS SO EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT UP THERE, AND YOUR MARGIN FOR ERROR IS -- IT'S LIKE THE WIDTH OF A HAIR. I'M JUST KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED THAT WE WON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TO DEAL WITH. BUT I'M EXPECTING TO SEE A FAIR AMOUNT OF FROSTBITE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AS PEOPLE COME DOWN. Narrator: TEMPERATURES ON THE SUMMIT HAVE BEEN TWICE AS LOW AS A HOME FREEZER. AND BOB FEELS THE EFFECT ON HIS FEET. WITH GéRARD'S ARRIVAL, THE SHERPAS HAVE GOT EVERYONE BACK TO CAMP 4. BUT THE FRENCH CLIMBER HARDLY HAS THE ENERGY TO REACH HIS TENT, LET ALONE CONTEMPLATE GETTING DOWN TO CAMP 3. IT'S VITAL THAT EVERYONE GETS DOWN TO CAMP 3, JUST BELOW THE DEATH ZONE. AFTER A 14-HOUR, BONE-NUMBING CLIMB, THEY'VE STILL GOT THREE GRUELING HOURS AHEAD OF THEM. DAY 48. EVERYONE'S BACK AT CAMP 3 -- EVEN GéRARD AND TIM. Woody: HOW DID YOU SLEEP? YEAH, I SLEPT GOOD. I SLEPT GOOD. I JUST CAN'T FEEL MY LEFT FOOT. GéRARD, IF YOU ARE READY, YOU CAN GO, YEAH. FOR GéRARD AND THE REST OF THE TEAM, THE DESCENT TO ABC WILL TAKE UP TO 12 HOURS. BUT WHILE GéRARD CAN GET DOWN UNDER HIS OWN STEAM, MARK CAN'T. THE SUMMIT ORDEAL HAS LEFT HIS STUMPS FROSTBITTEN AND RUBBED RAW. MARK CAN'T AFFORD TO SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT ON THE MOUNTAIN. SOMEHOW, WOODY MUST GET HIM DOWN TO ADVANCED BASE CAMP WITH THE RESOURCES AT HAND. ANYBODY HAVE A ROLL MAT? Tim: HUH? A ROLL MAT. THIS IS A JURY RIG. DON'T ASK ME EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING, 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST MAKING IT UP AS I GO. THOUGH I DO HAVE SOME ROUGH PLAN OF ATTACK. Russell: WE ALWAYS KNEW WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO HELP MARK GET DOWN BECAUSE A MAN WITH STUMPS WALKING THAT FAR IN ONE DAY, IN THAT SORT OF TERRAIN WAS GOING TO BE TOUGH. SO I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT WE HAVE TO HELP RIGHT NOW. Narrator: TIM VOLUNTEERS TO HELP, AND YESTERDAY'S MUTINY IS FORGOTTEN. Woody: ALL RIGHT, MARK. YOU READY? I CAN TAKE THE WEIGHT. AS THE EXPEDITION LEAVES CAMP, RUSSELL HEARS THE NEWS ABOUT THE DYING CLIMBER THAT EVERYONE'S BEEN EXPECTING. I CHECKED TODAY WITH OTHER SHERPAS WHO WENT TO THE SUMMIT TODAY, AND... HE DEFINITELY DIED LAST NIGHT. Narrator: ONE MEMBER OF A RIVAL TEAM IS MISSING. MAX TRIES TO IDENTIFY THE MAN HE SAW FROM THE PASSPORT PHOTO. WHAT DO YOU THINK? BECAUSE THIS MAN IS MISSING. THE HAIR, I'D SAY YES. Russell: IT AFFECTED MAX A LOT, BUT THAT'S THE FIRST TIME HE'S SEEN THIS. BUT I'VE SEEN IT A LOT HERE. I MIGHT BE A HARD-NOSED OLD [BLEEP] BUT THAT'S THE REALITY OF WORKING HERE AND WORKING ON THE SIDE OF MOUNT EVEREST, AND I WISHED A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE KNEW THAT BEFORE THEY TOOK THAT CHALLENGE ON. Narrator: BACK UP THE MOUNTAIN, THE TEAM IS IN FULL RESCUE MODE. MARK CAN'T GET DOWN ON HIS OWN, SO HIS FELLOW CLIMBERS SLIDE HIM DOWN THE SNOW SLOPE, AS HE HELPS CONTROL HIS RATE OF DESCENT. IF MARK LOST THE USE OF HIS LEGS ABOVE CAMP 4, WHERE THE DYING CLIMBER WAS FOUND, A SUCCESSFUL RESCUE WOULD HAVE BEEN NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE. TIM IS WIPED OUT. RUSSELL HAS TO SEND SHERPAS TO COMPLETE THE RESCUE. FOR DOUBLE AMPUTEE MARK INGLIS, TO SUMMIT WAS A TOWERING ACHIEVEMENT. BUT NOW IT'S PAYBACK TIME. IT'S TAKEN A NINE-MAN TEAM A NINE-HOUR, HARD SLOG TO GET MARK FROM CAMP 3 TO CAMP 1 -- A DISTANCE OF LESS THAN A MILE. MARK'S RESCUE IS AN EXHAUSTING ORDEAL, EVEN FROM THIS RELATIVELY SAFE ALTITUDE. ANY RESCUE OF THE CLIMBER WHO DIED WOULD HAVE STARTED MUCH HIGHER UP IN THE DEATH ZONE, PUTTING EVERYONE AT TREMENDOUS RISK. Russell: WELL, I ALWAYS KNEW HE'D DO IT. I'VE KNOWN HIM BEFORE HE HAD HIS LEGS CHOPPED OFF. IT BRINGS A TEAR TO MY EYE THAT INGLIS CAN DO THIS. THE SHERPAS ALSO -- THEY'RE VERY PROUD TO BE PART OF THIS WHOLE DEAL. THEY'LL GO THEIR LITTLE BIT EXTRA TO HELP MARK 'CAUSE THEY ADMIRE THIS GUY. WHOA! WE'LL SEE SOON. HE'S NOT FAR AWAY, YOU KNOW? Narrator: THE TOBOGGAN TEAM HAVE RUN OUT OF SNOW. FOR THE LAST FEW HUNDRED YARDS, IT'S DOWN TO SHERPA POWER. Mark: ONE? Woody: PHURBA. UNBELIEVABLE. Narrator: PHURBA NEGOTIATES THE ROCKY, ICY TRACK WITH 120 POUNDS ON HIS BACK. DOWN AT ABC, GéRARD ARRIVES AND NOW CONFRONTS THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE BITTER COLD. Terry: THERE'S FROSTBITE WITH GOOD PROGNOSIS -- THAT IS, YOU'RE GONNA KEEP YOUR FINGERS AND TOES. AND THERE'S FROSTBITE WITH REALLY BAD PROGNOSIS, AND THAT IS, WAIT AND SEE, BUT WE'RE NOT SURE IF YOU'RE GONNA KEEP THAT FINGER OR THAT HAND OR THAT TOE. Terry: GETTING CLOSE. ALMOST. Narrator: FOR NOW, GéRARD LOSES HIS WEDDING RING, WHICH WAS BLOCKING THE FLOW OF BLOOD TO HIS SWOLLEN FINGER. YES. BUT NOT... Terry: A REALLY BLACK APPENDAGE OR SKIN IS USUALLY A PRETTY BAD SIGN. AS FAR AS WHAT WE CAN DO HERE TO GIVE THEM THE BEST CHANCE OF KEEPING THEIR FINGERS AND TOES OR WHATEVER BIT IS AFFECTED IS ESSENTIALLY REWARM THE TISSUE -- REVERSE THE PROCESS -- THAW IT OUT. Man: HELLO, MARK. Narrator: MARK DOESN'T NEED ANY LESSONS ABOUT FROSTBITE. 24 YEARS AFTER LOSING BOTH LEGS BELOW THE KNEE, HE FACES THE NIGHTMARE OF LOSING EVEN MORE. Man: GOOD DAY, MARK. BUT HIS SUMMIT DREAM IS NOW A REALITY, THANKS TO THE MAN THE SHERPAS CALL KING OF THE MOUNTAIN. Russell: THIS IS THE MOST FROSTBITE DAMAGE I'VE EVER HAD. THIS IS PART OF THE OVERCROWDING THING. HERE WE HAD STRONG PEOPLE BEING HELD UP BY INCOMPETENT PEOPLE. Terry: HE'S GOT SNOW BLINDNESS, RIGHT EYE. THIS IS GONNA STING. THESE FIRST DROPS ARE GONNA STING. SOMEONE SAID BEFORE, "IS THE JOB FINISHED ON THE MOUNTAIN?" I THINK OUR JOB JUST STARTED. AND I'VE SAID BEFORE IT'S LIKE A WAR ZONE, YOU KNOW? THIS IS A BIG MOUNTAIN, AND EVERYONE AT WAR WITH THE MOUNTAIN. OH, YEAH. YEAH. OKAY. OH, MAN. Narrator: LAST BACK IS TIM. IT'S 8:00. HE'S BEEN DESCENDING FOR 12 HOURS. AND THE EFFORT OF HELPING MARK HAS DRAINED HIM OF ALL ENERGY. THANKS FOR THE FOOD. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] OKAY? I ALMOST TOOK THAT TO THE TOP. 100 METERS. SO CLOSE. SO CLOSE. OH, IT'S OKAY. I MIGHT BE WIPED OUT, BUT I NEVER LOST MY APPETITE. OH, BEAUTIFUL. [ LAUGHTER ] ED, PLEASE. Narrator: NO ONE WHO WENT FOR THE SUMMIT YESTERDAY HAS ESCAPED FROSTBITE, BUT TIM GOT OFF LIGHTER THAN MOST. HE AND RUSSELL PUT THE PAST BEHIND THEM, AS TREATMENT BEGINS ON TIM'S NUMB FINGERS. JUST THE TIP. JUST RELAX, PLEASE. LET ME HAVE A LOOK NOW. Tim: RUSSELL MADE THE DECISION TO TURN ME AROUND. IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD, BUT I GOT A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HIM, SO I RESPECT HIS DECISION. WASN'T AN EASY ONE. TASHI, DON'T THROW AWAY MY FOOD. Man: DON'T WORRY. WE'VE GOT MORE COMING. THE MOUNTAIN'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. AND I DIDN'T HEAR NO BELL. SO I'LL BE BACK NEXT YEAR WITH PHURBA BY MY SIDE. Narrator: MAY 17th. RUSSELL'S TEAM IS PACKING UP AND HEADING OUT. WHILE OTHER EXPEDITIONS STILL STRUGGLE FOR THE SUMMIT, HIS CLIMBERS ARE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AND SAFE FROM THE STORMS. RUSSELL'S BIG WEATHER GAMBLE HAS PAID OFF. BUT A WORLD AWAY, A STORM OF A VERY DIFFERENT KIND IS BREWING. NEWSPAPERS AND WEBSITES ARE STARTING TO QUESTION WHY THE DYING CLIMBER WAS NOT RESCUED. Russell: WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH A MAN LIKE THAT. IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE. Man: UNLESS YOU COULD SEND 20 SHERPAS UP. YEAH, BUT WHERE DO YOU FIND 20 SHERPAS, YOU KNOW? 20 SHERPAS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN TO THE SUMMIT AND... HOW DO YOU GET 20 SHERPAS THERE TO CARRY THAT MAN ON THAT DAY AT THAT MOMENT THAT YOU'VE JUST FOUND LYING ON THE SIDE OF THE TRACK? YOU KNOW, IT'S TOO LATE. Bob: SOME OF THE PLACES YOU'RE WALKING, YOU'RE PUTTING ONE FOOT 50 DEGREES, 60 DEGREES, AND YOU'RE WALKING ON AN EDGE LIKE THAT. HOW IN THE HELL IS ONE OR TWO MEN -- OR SIX MEN -- GONNA MANEUVER A PERSON LIKE THAT? HE HAD TO GET UP ON HIS TWO FEET AND WALK DOWN TO CAMP, AND HE WAS BEYOND THAT STAGE. NO HELICOPTER CAN FLY THIS HIGH. NO YAK OR ANIMAL CAN GO THERE TO BRING HIM BACK. NO HUMAN BEING CAN CARRY HIM DOWN. Terry: IT'S LIKE LOSING A MAN IN SPACE. I MEAN, I PERSONALLY ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT MY BEST FRIENDS WOULDN'T COME AND SAVE MY LIFE IF I HAD AN ACCIDENT UP THERE. LAST YEAR, THERE WAS A KOREAN EXPEDITION THAT WAS SOLELY HERE TO RETRIEVE A BODY. THEY GOT TO THE BODY. THEY MOVED IT 100 YARDS IN FIVE HOURS AND GAVE UP. Narrator: THE 2006 SEASON ON EVEREST CLAIMED 11 LIVES, MAKING IT THE SECOND-WORST YEAR ON RECORD. THE DEAD INCLUDE THE MAN LEFT TO DIE -- A DECISION RUSSELL CHOSE TO EXPLAIN PERSONALLY TO THE MAN'S FAMILY. I CALLED THE FATHER THIS MORNING AND TOLD HIM THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHAT'S HAPPENED. I ALSO SAID, "WE CAN'T GET THE BODY DOWN, BUT NEXT YEAR, I'LL SHIFT IT FOR YOU SO IT'S OFF THE ROUTE." SO, YOU KNOW... PRETTY HORRIBLE JOB. AND SO... [BLEEP] [ LAUGHTER ] THE ADVENTURE FINISHES. IT'S THE END OF THE TRIP. WE GO BACK HOME. MARK, WELL DONE. IT'S A FIRST, TO GET A MAN LIKE THIS, AND... IT'S PRETTY COOL. YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T WORK... DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT ALL THE BOYS. DORJI. PODAM. DANORI. THEY COOKED FOR YOU EVERY SINGLE DAY. PHURBA TASHI AND HIS TEAM OF NEPALESE SHERPAS... AND NARWANG AND HIS TEAM OF TIBET SHERPAS, WHO WORKED SO HARD FOR YOU GUYS, WHO PUT THE ROPE AND WHO WORKED TO GET YOU BACK DOWN. WHEN YOU DIDN'T TURN AROUND, PHURBA AND HIS TEAM WERE RIGHT BESIDE YOU, EVERY SINGLE ONE. Tim: THE BIGGEST THING I LEARNED THIS YEAR -- PROBABLY GETTING TO THE SUMMIT IS ONLY HALFWAY. UM... WE GOT TO THANK THE CLIENTS, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. FOR THOSE THAT SUCCEEDED, WELL DONE. SORRY FOR THOSE THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT. I REACHED MY SUMMIT. I SUMMITED UP THERE. EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T GET TO THE TOP, I REACHED THE TOP OF MY OWN MOUNTAIN. I'M SORRY FOR THE FROSTBITE. DESPERATELY SORRY FOR THAT. I THINK I MADE A MISTAKE TO SEND SOME OF YOU ON THAT DAY. Gérard: [ SPEAKING FRENCH ] AND THE HARDEST PART NOW IS... TO TUK BAHADUR THAPA MAGAR, WHO DIED BEFORE WE GOT HERE. [ Voice breaking ] LET'S THINK ABOUT HIM AND HIS FAMILY. WE'VE HAD 166 PEOPLE ON THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST. FIRST PERSON WE LOST. OKAY. THE ADVENTURE FINISHES. LETS GO AND GET [BLEEP] [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST, THEY'RE VERY STRONG IN THEIR MIND. ANYONE THAT CLIMBS EVEREST IS ALWAYS GOING TO GO HOME AND BE A BETTER PERSON IN THEIR LIFE. IT'S A VIEW TO DIE FOR. PUT ME ON THE FIRST YAK BACK TO KATHMANDU. EVEREST WAS A PRIORITY. IT'S NO LONGER A PRIORITY. NO, I CAN'T DO IT, AND I DON'T WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE. TO STAND ON TOP OF EVEREST AND TO COME HOME AGAIN IS A MAJOR TRIUMPH -- A MAJOR TRIUMPH. Max: WE WERE THERE. WE WERE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE JET THAT WILL BEAR ME THROUGH THE HEAVENS BACK HOME, HOPEFULLY. 7,500 METERS! WHOO! WHOO-HOO! IF RUSS ASKS ME TO TURN AROUND NEXT YEAR, WILL I? [ CHUCKLES ] NO, I'LL PROBABLY [BLEEP] HIM OFF FOR ABOUT A HALF-HOUR THIS TIME. WHOO! Russell: I'M NOT KING OF THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN ON EARTH. I KNOW THIS VALLEY MORE THAN MOST WHITE PEOPLE. BUT YOU'RE NOT KING ON THIS MOUNTAIN, MAN. NO ONE'S KING. ONLY THE MOUNTAIN'S KING. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS
