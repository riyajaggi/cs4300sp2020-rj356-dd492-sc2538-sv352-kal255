 Narrator: LAST TIME ON "EVEREST"... THE CLIMBERS ARE ON THEIR WAY... [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST. BUT TIM MEDVETZ ISN'T PLAYING BY THE RULES, AND EXPEDITION LEADER RUSSELL BRICE THREATENS TO PULL HIM OFF THE TEAM. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT, THEN YOU GET OUT OF THE GAME. YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT? YOU'RE TURNING ME AROUND? Narrator: NOW THE CLIMBERS ENTER THE DEATH ZONE. FOR TWO EVEREST VETERANS, IT'S A PAINFUL REUNION.

 IT'S DEFINITELY KICKED MY BUTT. MY ASTHMA JUST WENT [BLEEP] HAYWIRE. Narrator: AND NEWBIE ROD BABER COMES FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE HORRORS OF EVEREST. OH, NO. I'VE JUST SEEN A BODY. Tim: WELL, IT'S CLIMBING EVEREST, MAN. PEOPLE DIE. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: IT'S DAY 38 OF THE EXPEDITION. TODAY, THE MISSION TO SUMMIT EVEREST FINALLY BEGINS. THE TEAM SPEARHEADING THE ASSAULT SPENT THE NIGHT AT CAMP 1, 23,000 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL. IN JUST 72 HOURS, IF ALL GOES TO PLAN,

 THEY WILL BE STANDING AT THE HIGHEST POINT ON THE PLANET. RUSSELL BRICE CALLS CAMP 1 TO CHECK THAT HIS TEAM ARE READY FOR THE SUMMIT PUSH. Russell: NORTH COL, NORTH COL. HOW'S EVERYONE DOING THIS MORNING? [ STATIC ] Narrator: YESTERDAY, RUSSELL ALMOST THREW TIM OFF THE TEAM. HE'S HIGH ON THE AGENDA. YEAH. DID YOU GIVE BIG BOY A KICK? OKAY, LET'S KEEP AN EYE ON HIM TODAY. Narrator: THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S ULTIMATUM IS STILL RATTLING THROUGH TIM'S HEAD. Tim: HE'S NOT THE NICEST GUY ON THE MOUNTAIN, THAT'S FOR SURE. BUT I'M NOT PAYING $42,000 TO HAVE SOMEBODY BE NICE TO ME. ANYBODY TALKED TO ME LIKE THAT IN LOS ANGELES, IT'D BE A DIFFERENT STORY. Narrator: TIM KNOWS TODAY HE MUST SHOW HIS TEAM LEADER HE HAS WHAT IT TAKES. THE EVENTS OF LAST YEAR ARE STILL BURNED DEEP IN RUSSELL'S MEMORY. ON SUMMIT DAY LAST YEAR, TIM WAS SO SLOW UP THE MOUNTAIN THAT HIS OXYGEN LEVELS REACHED CRITICAL. FOR ONE HOUR, RUSSELL TRIED TO TURN HIM AROUND. TIM, WHY DON'T YOU JUST START TO PLEASE COME BACK? Narrator: TIM REFUSED. JUST 328 FEET SHORT OF THE SUMMIT, HE FINALLY GAVE UP. THAT MOMENT HAS STAYED WITH HIM EVER SINCE. LAST 100 METERS, WHERE I GOT TURNED AROUND -- THAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK ABOUT. IT JUST HAUNTS ME EVERY DAY -- EVERY DAY -- WHAT'S AROUND THAT CORNER. AND I WAS RIGHT THERE LOOKING AT IT, AND I FEEL A LITTLE MORE HUNGRIER NOW. I'M READY. Narrator: CLIMBING ALONGSIDE TIM IS ANOTHER EVEREST VETERAN, CALIFORNIAN PHYSICIAN FRED ZIEL. BUT THE REST OF THE TEAM ARE NEW TO THE MOUNTAIN -- BRITISH CLIMBER ROD BABER AND LITHUANIAN DARIUS VAICIULIS. Rod: THIS IS MY TENTMATE, DARIUS. HE'S FROM LITHUANIA. HE DOESN'T COOK. I FOUND OUT HE CAN'T COOK OR BOIL WATER. WOMEN COOK IN OUR COUNTRY. YEAH, IN HIS COUNTRY, WOMEN COOK. SO I HAD TO DO ALL THE COOKING AND THE BOILING. I AM JUST RELAXING. FIVE CLIMBERS HAVE ALREADY DIED ON EVEREST THIS YEAR, AND THE DANGERS THAT LIE AHEAD ARE PREYING ON EVERYONE'S MIND. Rod: AND I HAVEN'T SLEPT FOR NIGHTS BECAUSE EVEREST KEEPS ON FLASHING UP IN MY HEAD EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES. IT'S THE FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN WHICH IS PROBABLY WHAT'S REVEALING ITSELF TO US AT THE MOMENT. Narrator: THE CLIMBERS FACE A GRUELING 6,000-FOOT CLIMB. THEY'LL OVERNIGHT IN THE THREE HIGH CAMPS BEFORE ENTERING THE DEATH ZONE TO MAKE THEIR SUMMIT ATTEMPT AND JOIN THE FEW WHO CAN TRULY SAY THEY HAVE STOOD ON TOP OF THE WORLD. IT'S THE BEST WEATHER ON EVEREST ANYONE CAN EVER REMEMBER. AND RUSSELL'S GOT THE FORECAST JUST RIGHT. BUT THE CLIMBERS ARE WEARING THICK DOWN SUITS, READY FOR SUB-ZERO TEMPERATURES ON THE SUMMIT. AND AS THE SUN BURNS DOWN, THEY START TO FEEL THE HEAT. CLIMBING ISN'T ALWAYS COLD. Narrator: WHILE TEAM 1 STRUGGLE THROUGH THE OPPRESSIVE HEAT ON THEIR WAY TO CAMP 2... AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP, THE SECOND CLIMBING TEAM PREPARE FOR THEIR OWN SUMMIT ATTEMPT. WANT SOME CREAM? YEAH. 'CAUSE YOU GET HOT, AND YOU GO PKK! YEAH. YEAH. FIVE DAYS AGO, RUSSELL SPLIT THE EXPEDITION INTO TWO GROUPS BASED ON THEIR STRENGTH AND SPEED. FAST GROUP AND THE SLOW GROUP. IN TEAM 2 IS DANISH CLIMBER MOGENS JENSEN, AN ASTHMATIC WHO'S TRYING TO SUMMIT WITHOUT BOTTLED OXYGEN. JOINING HIM IS A GROUP OF JAPANESE, INCLUDING 24-YEAR-OLD KOBE AND 71-YEAR-OLD YANAGI. IF YANAGI SUCCEEDS, HE'LL BECOME THE OLDEST PERSON TO REACH THE SUMMIT. FOR GUIDE HIRO, IT'S A TOUGH ASSIGNMENT. AND HOW LONG IS IT GONNA TAKE YOU TO GET YOUR WAY UP TO CAMP 1? BUT YANAGI IS NO NOVICE. A HIGHLY RESPECTED MOUNTAINEER IN JAPAN, HE CLIMBED CHO OYU JUST LAST YEAR. HE PROMISED HIS FAMILY IT WOULD BE HIS LAST CLIMB. BUT AS HE STOOD AT 26,000 FEET, HE SAW EVEREST TOWERING IN THE DISTANCE AND KNEW HE'D BE BACK. [ SPEAKING JAPANESE ] [ LAUGHING ] YEAH, YEAH. LAST CHANCE, THIS. OKAY, NOW WE GO. Narrator: BUT WILL EVEREST BE A MOUNTAIN TOO FAR FOR SOMEONE SO OLD? TEAM 1 ARE NOW AT 23,500 FEET. THEY'VE BEEN GOING FOR TWO HOURS, STEP BY PAINFUL STEP. TIM'S DESPERATE TO SHOW RUSSELL HE CAN MAKE THE SUMMIT, BUT HE'S PUSHING TOO HARD. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] [ COUGHING ] KICKING MY BUTT. DEFINITELY KICKING MY BUTT. Narrator: THE BIG MAN IS STOPPED IN HIS TRACKS. JUST MAKE IT IN AN ACCEPTABLE TIME. RUSSELL MAY CAN HIM. Narrator: THIS MORNING, THE TEAM SPEARHEADING THE SUMMIT ATTEMPT LEFT FOR CAMP 2. THEY'VE GOT FIVE HOURS TO GET THERE OR THEY'RE OFF THE SUMMIT TEAM. AND TIM'S ON A MISSION TO PROVE HE HAS WHAT IT TAKES. [ COUGHS ] BUT HE'S GONE TOO FAST. NOW HE'S PAYING THE PRICE. FELT NAUSEA... DIZZY. THE WORST I FELT THE WHOLE TRIP. AND NOT A GOOD TIME TO FEEL BAD. Narrator: RUSSELL HAS INSTRUCTED HIS GUIDES TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON TIM. [ COUGHING ] HE KNOWS HE MUST STEP IN NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. Dean: I'D PROBABLY TRY TO MAKE A SLIGHTLY SLOWER PACE AND STOP LESS. FOR ME, THAT'S MUCH MORE ENERGY-EFFICIENT, BUT... THERE ARE SHERPAS DO WHAT YOU DO. AS I GET UP HIGHER, THEN I START DOING THAT... BOOM. BOOM. IT JUST WORKS FOR ME. Narrator: IT'S VITAL TIM LEARNS TO PACE HIMSELF. WHAT WORKS FOR THE SHERPAS WILL NEVER WORK FOR THE BIG WESTERNER. SOMEONE LIKE TIM, WHO'S VERY TALL -- HE'S GOT MORE BULK TO MOVE UP THAT MOUNTAIN. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE LOCAL HIGH-ALTITUDE PEOPLE, SHERPAS OR TIBETANS -- THEY'RE SMALL, THEY'RE WIRY, THEY DON'T WEIGH A LOT. PHYSICALLY, FOR HIM, I THINK IT WILL BE MORE EFFORT. [ SIGHS ] NOT GOOD FOR ME. [ SPITS ] REALLY BAD. Narrator: HUNDREDS OF CLIMBERS HAVE ALREADY CONQUERED EVEREST THIS SEASON, BUT SOME HAVE PAID A HEAVY PRICE. AS TEAM 1 CLIMB HIGHER, THEY PASS THE WALKING WOUNDED ON THEIR WAY DOWN. AN IRISHMAN WHO SUMMITED IS SNOW-BLIND. HE'S LOST ALL VISION. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. NOT QUITE HOW I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ON MOUNT EVEREST. Narrator: IT'S TAKEN HIS TEAMMATES HOURS, BUT THEY'VE GOT HIM DOWN 4,500 FEET FROM CAMP 4. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE FEAT OF ENDURANCE THAT HAS SAVED HIS LIFE. SEVERAL TIMES, I THOUGHT I WAS A GONER, PASSED A FEW DEAD BODIES, ROLLED OVER A FEW, ACTUALLY, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, 'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THEY WERE. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D COME DOWN THIS WAY. Narrator: THE INJURED CLIMBER NEEDS URGENT TREATMENT. BUT EVACUATION BY HELICOPTER TO A HOSPITAL IS NOT AN OPTION. HIS ONLY HOPE IS RUSSELL'S MEDICAL FACILITIES AND EXPEDITION DOCTOR MONICA PIRIS. I NEED EYEDROPS AND BITS AND PIECES TO PATCH HIS EYES UP. WELL, ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES -- WHAT HAVE WE GOT? VOLTAREN, IBUPROFEN, BRUFEN. Narrator: AS MONICA ORGANIZES SUPPLIES, MOGENS PREPARES TO LEAVE ADVANCED BASE CAMP FOR HIS OWN SUMMIT ATTEMPT. HE MAKES AN OFFERING TO THE MOUNTAIN GODS TO GRANT HIM SAFE PASSAGE TO THE SUMMIT AND A SAFE RETURN. HIS THOUGHTS TURN TO HOME IN DENMARK. MY FIANCéE, CHRISTINA -- SHE'S WITH ME ALL THE WAY, IN SPIRIT, AND, OF COURSE, ON THIS PICTURE, AND THAT GIVES ME STRENGTH. WHENEVER THE GOING GETS TOUGH, I'LL JUST THINK ABOUT HER AND KEEP ON GOING. LUCKY NUMBER 7. 7 IS MY FIANCéE'S LUCKY NUMBER. YEAH. IT'S TIME. Narrator: AS MOGENS LEAVES, THE SNOW-BLIND CLIMBER ARRIVES. HE CAN'T SEE A THING. BUT THERE MAY BE WORSE TO COME. STRUCK DOWN BY AGONIZING PAIN, HE WAS FORCED TO HOLE UP AT CAMP 4 DURING HIS DESCENT, SUBJECTING HIS BODY TO AN EXTRA NIGHT IN THE DEATH ZONE. JUST TELL ME -- TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. I HAD A REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE COMING DOWN OFF THE SECOND STEP, WHICH CAUSED ME TO LOSE MY GLASSES. AND I PRACTICALLY KILLED MYSELF, ACTUALLY, COMING OFF THE LADDER. HOW LONG WERE YOU WITHOUT GLASSES FOR? 20 MINUTES, MAYBE. IF THAT. NOT SURE. JUST 20 MINUTES WITHOUT GLASSES. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT, YEAH. WITH EVERY 1,000 FEET, ULTRAVIOLET RAYS INCREASE BY 5%. AT THE SECOND STEP, WHERE HE LOST HIS GLASSES, THE CLIMBER WAS BEING HIT BY U.V. LEVELS 15 TIMES OVER THE SAFE LIMIT. I WAS CONCERNED THAT AN ELEMENT OF THIS WAS GONNA BE CEREBRAL EDEMA, BUT I DON'T -- I'M NOT GETTING THAT FEELING. YOU SEEM FAIRLY DEXTEROUS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T... SEE. SEE. OKAY, I'M GONNA TAKE YOUR GLASSES OFF. YEAH, JUST PUT YOUR HEAD BACK. IT'S OKAY. CAN YOU OPEN THEM AT ALL? YOURSELF? THEY'RE STUCK. OKAY. OKAY. GET SOME WARM WATER. REST YOUR HEAD BACK. THAT'S GOOD. IT'S SUNBURN OF YOUR CORNEA, OKAY? THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT. IT CAN BE EXQUISITELY PAINFUL. SUNBURNT, THE OUTER LAYER OF THE EYE BLISTERS. THE INTENSE PAIN AND SEVERE SWELLING MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR VICTIMS TO OPEN THEIR EYES. POP THE OINTMENT IN. SAVE MY EYESIGHT. IN EXTREME CASES, THE BLINDNESS CAN BE PERMANENT. DARK TENT, DARK GLASSES, PADS. YEAH. MONICA, HOPEFULLY, I'LL GET TO SEE YOU BEFORE I GO. YEAH. [ LAUGHING ] IT WILL COME BACK. DON'T BE FRIGHTENED. AS THE INJURED MAN RECOVERS AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP, TEAM 1 ARE FIGHTING THEIR WAY TO CAMP 2. THEY'VE BEEN CLIMBING FOR OVER FOUR HOURS. RUSSELL'S FIVE-HOUR DEADLINE DRAWS EVER CLOSER. BUT FOR ROD, THE END IS IN SIGHT. [ COUGHS ] IT'S STILL -- IT'S STILL ABOUT 10 MINUTES AWAY. THAT'S THE [BLEEP] MAD THING ABOUT IT. IT LOOKS LIKE A MINUTE AWAY. I'M JUST VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE. Narrator: PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTED, THE TEAM STARTS TO ARRIVE IN CAMP. THEY RETREAT TO THE RELATIVE COMFORT OF THEIR TENTS TO RECOVER. BUT THEY'RE ONE MAN DOWN. IT'S TIM. EVEREST IS SMOTHERED IN A WHITEOUT. HE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. BUT WHERE? Narrator: TEAM 1 ARE AT CAMP 2, 24,500 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL ON THEIR WAY TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST. BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF TIM, AND RUSSELL'S DEADLINE IS ABOUT TO EXPIRE. FINALLY, A FIGURE APPEARS OUT OF THE MIST. IT'S TIM. HE'S MADE IT... JUST. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] LAST HOUR, THERE WAS A [BLEEP] WHITEOUT. TAKE FOUR STEPS, FALL BACK TWO. Narrator: FOR NOW, HE CAN STAY ON THE TEAM. Tim: DOES IT BOTHER ME BEING THE SLOWEST GUY ON THE TEAM? NO. YOU COME TO MOUNT EVEREST, YOU GOT TO THROW YOUR PRIDE OUT THE WINDOW. BELL DIDN'T RING. I'M GOING UP. BAM! Narrator: RUSSELL'S SUMMIT PLAN HAS THE TEAM GOING ON OXYGEN TOMORROW NIGHT. BUT TIM HAS ARRANGED TO START ON OXYGEN A DAY EARLY. IT'S AN EXPENSIVE REQUEST. FROM KATHMANDU, HALFWAY UP EVEREST BY YAK, AND, ULTIMATELY, ON A SHERPA'S BACK, IT COST $650 TO GET THIS TANK HERE. TIM THINKS IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY. NOW THAT I'M HERE, PROBABLY GONNA SUCK ON A LITTLE BIT OF O's MAYBE FOR ABOUT A HALF-HOUR. AND THEN IN THE MORNING, I'LL CRANK THIS UP AND PUSH UP TO 3. Woody: YEAH, BILL. VERY GOOD. EVERYBODY'S SETTLED IN. TIM'S HAPPILY SUCKING OXYGEN, SO HE'S A HAPPY MAN. [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH, BIG BABY, BIG BLUE BOTTLE. Narrator: WITH A NEW DAY COMES A NEW CHALLENGE. TEAM 1 MUST CLIMB 1,400 FEET TO CAMP 3, JUST BELOW THE DEATH ZONE. IT WILL STRETCH THEM TO THE LIMIT AS THE LACK OF OXYGEN STARTS TO TAKE ITS TOLL ON THEIR BODIES. I HAD A HORRENDOUSLY [BLEEP] NIGHT LAST NIGHT. Rod: YEAH, I THINK EVERYBODY DID. IT WAS LIKE BEING IN A BAD DREAM, THIS KIND OF STATE OF DELIRIUM. MY HANDS ARE FREEZING NOW. I'VE GOT A BIG HEADACHE. I FEEL NAUSEOUS. Narrator: THE ENTIRE TEAM ARE SUFFERING, EVEN THE GUIDES. BUT AFTER A NIGHT ON HIS BABY BOTTLE, TIM IS READY TO GO. SUMMIT'S THAT WAY. GOING UP. PACK YOUR BABY BOTTLE UP? HUH? TAKING YOUR BABY BOTTLE UP? GO [BLEEP] YOURSELF. Narrator: YESTERDAY, TIM WAS LAST INTO CAMP. THIS MORNING, HE'S FIRST MAN OUT. USING THE BOTTLE, TIM'S BREATHING THE SAME LEVEL OF OXYGEN AS HE WOULD 3,000 FEET BELOW. AS FAR AS HIS BODY'S CONCERNED, IT'S STILL AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP. HE FLIES UP. Rod: NEVER SEEN ANYONE LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE, AND TO SEE TIM DO THAT, IT'S JUST AMAZING. SO WHY AREN'T WE ON OXYGEN? THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW. Narrator: THE REST OF THE TEAM FOLLOW IN TIM'S FOOTSTEPS. AS THEY STRUGGLE FOR EVERY BREATH, THE SUMMIT SEEMS A LONG WAY AWAY. AT CAMP 1, TEAM 2 ARE READY TO LEAVE. MOGENS JENSEN'S SUMMIT BID IS STILL ON SCHEDULE. BUT 71-YEAR-OLD YANAGI, WHO WILL GO ON OXYGEN TODAY, HAS A PROBLEM WHICH MAY FORCE HIM OFF THE MOUNTAIN. [ COUGHING ] AT THIS ALTITUDE, THE MILDEST ILLNESS CAN BE A KILLER. IN THE DEATH ZONE, AN INFECTION COULD BE FATAL FOR A YOUNG MAN, LET ALONE A 71-YEAR-OLD. [ COUGHS ] HIRO WILL HAVE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON YANAGI. [ COUGHS ] 2,000 FEET BELOW AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP... AN ITALIAN GROUP ASK RUSSELL FOR HELP. THEY'VE RECEIVED AN S.O.S. CALL FROM ANOTHER ITALIAN EXPEDITION IN TROUBLE UP THE MOUNTAIN. [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] A CLIMBER CALLED ITALY ON A SATELLITE PHONE. THE MESSAGE HAS TRAVELED BACK ACROSS THE GLOBE TO ABC. HIS TEAM HAVE BECOME SPLIT UP, AND SEVERAL ARE MISSING. THE DETAILS ARE SKETCHY. [ SPEAKING ITALIAN ] Kari: THEY DON'T KNOW EVEN WHO IS MISSING, AND SOME OF THEM ARE CLIMBING ON 17, TODAY THERE'S 19, SO THEY'RE MISSING 10 FOR TWO DAYS. CAMP 3, CAMP 3, DO YOU COPY? Narrator: EVERY MEMBER OF RUSSELL'S EXPEDITION CARRIES A RADIO. THEY CAN CALL FOR HELP AT ANY TIME. BUT THE MAN WHO MADE THE DISTRESS CALL HASN'T GOT ONE. RUSSELL HAS NO WAY TO CONTACT HIM. HE CAN -- HE HAVE MASK OR NOT? ON THE SUMMIT, HE HAD MASK AND OXYGEN. I GOT ONE BOTTLE. Russell: THEY'RE WANTING US TO SEND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE UP THE MOUNTAIN TO FIND THEIR PEOPLE. HE HAS A SAT PHONE UP THERE BUT NO RADIOS. WITH A SAT PHONE, YOU COULD TALK TO MUM AT HOME, BUT YOU CAN'T TALK TO ANYONE DOWN HERE TO TELL THEM WHERE YOU ARE. THEY CAN TALK WITH THE WHOLE WORLD BUT NOT WITH THE BASE CAMP. Narrator: RUSSELL CALLS UP THE MOUNTAIN TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS PASSED THE MISSING CLIMBERS. TEAM 1 GUIDE DEAN TAKES THE CALL. DEAN, DO YOU COPY? YEAH, GO AHEAD, RUSS. JUST HAVING A WEE BREAK. IT'S KIND OF WALKING THROUGH A BIT OF AN EMPTY GHOST TOWN, REALLY. ALL THE CAMPS SEEM PRETTY EMPTY. [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] Narrator: RUSSELL SPREADS THE SEARCH. HIS SHERPAS CALL RIVAL TEAMS ON THE MOUNTAIN. A RUMOR COMES BACK. A FROSTBITTEN ITALIAN CLIMBER HAS BEEN SEEN IN A TENT SOMEWHERE BELOW CAMP 3. WE CAN SEND ONE BOY DOWN TO HIM... WITH ONE MASK, ONE OXYGEN. ALL RUSSELL'S SHERPAS ON THE MOUNTAIN ARE INVOLVED IN A SUMMIT PUSH. TO SEARCH FOR THE ITALIAN, HE'LL HAVE TO PULL A MAN OFF THE TEAM. THIS COULD PUT HIS OWN CLIMBERS IN JEOPARDY. [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] WE'LL DO IT. ONE LESS SHERPA TOMORROW. YOU KNOW? I'M ASKING ONE SHERPA TO TAKE SOME OXYGEN AND A MASK AND A RADIO, GO DOWN TO SEE THIS PERSON. THEN MAYBE WE CAN TALK AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO NEXT. BUT NOW THIS MEANS ONE -- MAYBE ONE OF OUR PEOPLE CAN'T GO SUMMIT. Narrator: TEAM 1 ARE BLISSFULLY UNAWARE THAT EVENTS UNFOLDING 4,000 FEET BELOW COULD BRING THEIR SUMMIT BID TO A BITTER END. Narrator: TEAM 1 ARE NOW NEARLY 5 MILES ABOVE SEA LEVEL. THERE'S 60% LESS OXYGEN IN THE AIR. EVEREST FIRST-TIMER ROD HAS NEVER BEEN THIS HIGH BEFORE. YOUR LUNGS DON'T FEEL BIG ENOUGH, AND YOUR HEART FEELS TOO SMALL. AND YOUR LIMBS FEEL TOO SHORT, AND YOUR HEAD FEELS LIKE IT'S ABOUT TO EXPLODE. Narrator: AHEAD OF ROD, TIM IS ALREADY USING SUPPLEMENTARY OXYGEN. A SUPPLY OF JUST 2 LITERS PER MINUTE MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE. EVERYTHING SEEMS PERFECT. BUT ON EVEREST, TROUBLE'S NEVER FAR AWAY. ON SUMMIT DAY LAST YEAR, TIM WAS LATE OUT OF CAMP. TIM, HOW ARE YOU DOING? 20 VITAL MINUTES MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. HEY. WHOA! HE GOT CAUGHT IN A BOTTLENECK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 100-FOOT-HIGH ROCK WALL KNOWN AS THE SECOND STEP. Tim: IT WAS MISERABLE. HAD ICICLES ON MY EYELASHES. I NEVER EXPERIENCED COLD LIKE THAT IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I WOULDN'T WISH THAT DAY UPON MY WORST ENEMY. Narrator: HE BELIEVES IT COST HIM THE CHANCE TO SUMMIT. HE'S DETERMINED IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. WAY BELOW, THE EVENTS OF LAST YEAR ARE CATCHING UP WITH ANOTHER EVEREST VETERAN -- MOGENS JENSEN. NOW AT 24,000 FEET, THE THIN AIR IS STARTING TO AFFECT HIM. HE'S COME TO A COMPLETE STANDSTILL. MY ASTHMA JUST WENT [BLEEP] HAYWIRE AGAIN. IT'S LIKE I'M BREATHING THROUGH HALF A LUNG, SO -- AND IT'S JUST -- IT'S UNREAL, YOU KNOW? I CAN'T CLIMB EVEREST ON ONE LUNG, SO WE'LL SEE. PROBABLY NOT MUCH OF A CHANCE. Narrator: BOTTLED OXYGEN COULD BE THE ANSWER TO MOGENS' PROBLEMS, BUT IT'S ONE MEDICINE HE REFUSES TO TAKE. [BLEEP] Narrator: AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP, DR. MONICA RECEIVES AN S.O.S. CALL FROM MOGENS. HIS ASTHMA IS SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL. BREATHING THROUGH A QUARTER OF A STRAW, MOVING AT HALF THE PACE I NORMALLY DO. ARE YOU USING YOUR INHALERS? YEAH, I AM. AND I CAN FEEL EVERYTHING. IT'S JUST LIKE THE STRAITJACKET FEELING IN MY CHEST. YOU CAN DOUBLE YOUR INHALERS. BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOT A LOT ELSE WE CAN DO, HUH? NO, I KNOW. I THINK WE'RE ABOUT ONE HOUR FROM CAMP 2, SO I'LL SEE IF I CAN GET THERE, AND WE'LL SEE HOW IT IS IN THE MORNING. Narrator: HIGH ABOVE, TIM'S LISTENING IN TO HIS BUDDY'S DISTRESS CALL. MOGENS, THIS IS TIM. JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, I'M BEHIND YOU. ONE MORE HOUR. GET UP THERE, MAN. YOU CAN DO IT. WE'RE BEHIND YOU. KEEP PUSHING. DON'T STOP. NO QUITTING. DEFINITELY THE TOUGHEST HOUR OF HIS LIFE. EVERYTHING'S ON THE LINE FOR HIM RIGHT NOW. ONE ITALIAN MEMBER. ONE ITALIAN MEMBER? Narrator: RUSSELL'S FOCUS IS STILL FIRMLY ON THE HUNT FOR THE MISSING ITALIANS. ONE OF HIS SHERPAS HAS STARTED TO SEARCH THROUGH THE HIGH CAMPS. BUT THEN, NEWS COMES IN. TWO OF THE ITALIANS HAVE APPEARED AT NORTH COL, 3,000 FEET BELOW WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. Russell: THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MISSING, FIVE OF THEM, FOUR OF THEM, TWO OF THEM. EVERYONE'S BEEN RUNNING AROUND HELPING, AND THEN THEY TURNED OUT TO BE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE TO WHERE WE'RE LOOKING. Narrator: BUT TWO MORE ITALIAN CLIMBERS ARE STILL MISSING. AND THERE'S NO SIGN OF THEM. MY SHERPA ARE LOOKING OVER THERE, AND EVERYONE'S SAYING HE ALREADY WENT DOWN. HE'S ALREADY GONE. [ SPEAKING ITALIAN ] SO, I'M SORRY. I CAN'T HAVE MY MEN RUNNING EVERYWHERE. NO, NO. NO, SURE. SO, I CAN'T DO MUCH MORE NOW. I'M SORRY. WHEREVER THEY ARE, THE MISSING CLIMBERS ARE NOW ON THEIR OWN. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] Narrator: TEAM 1 ARE BATTLING TOWARDS CAMP 3 ON THEIR WAY TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST. PERCHED 5 MILES ABOVE SEA LEVEL, THIS SMALL GROUP OF TENTS MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE DEATH ZONE, WHERE THE TEAM WILL GO ON OXYGEN. UNLIKE HIS TEAMMATES, TIM'S ALREADY ON OXYGEN, AND IT'S TRANSFORMED HIM FROM THE SLOWEST INTO THE FASTEST. HE'S FIRST TO ARRIVE IN CAMP. Tim: 7-9. ONE STEP CLOSER OF GETTING OLD GLORY TO THE SUMMIT. Narrator: TIM'S BEEN HERE BEFORE. FOR ROD, IT'S A TOTALLY NEW EXPERIENCE. [ SIGHS ] WELCOME TO 7,900 METERS, MAN. YEAH. NEED SOME DRUGS? HUH? THE HIGHEST YOU EVER BEEN? [ SPITS ] BY 1,000 METERS. [ COUGHS ] NEXT INTO CAMP IS CALIFORNIAN PHYSICIAN FRED ZIEL. HE'S ATTEMPTED EVEREST TWICE. BOTH TIMES, HE NEARLY PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE. THIS IS THE VERY SPOT WHERE, IN 2005, HE GROUND TO AN ABRUPT HALT. HAVE YOU GUYS SAW THE TENT? YOU CAN HAVE ONE OF THOSE TWO. I ALMOST DIED IN THAT ONE. WHAT? I ALMOST DIED IN THAT TWO YEARS AGO. I WON'T SLEEP THERE. BEING BACK HERE IS AWAKENING THE DEMONS. GOT PRETTY SICK AT CAMP 3, AND... PASSED OUT. KIND OF RESCUED MYSELF. ENDED UP DIAGNOSING MYSELF WITH PNEUMONIA. HAD A LOT OF DOUBTS AFTER THAT ABOUT WHETHER I STILL HAD ENOUGH YOUTH LEFT TO COME AND DO THIS KIND OF THING, AND, UH... TOOK ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS TO PUT THINGS TOGETHER TO COME BACK AND... TEST IT OUT. HOPEFULLY, I CAN SAY BYE TO THE ALBATROSS. THAT ONE'S A NO-NO. Narrator: THE SHERPAS PREPARE A NEW TENT FOR HIM, WELL AWAY FROM THE SPOT WHERE HE NEARLY LOST HIS LIFE. EVEN SO, IT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH NIGHT FOR FRED. TEAM 2, WHO ARE FOLLOWING 24 HOURS BEHIND THE LEAD GROUP, HAVE JUST ARRIVED AT CAMP 2. MOGENS HAS BATTLED THROUGH HIS ASTHMA ATTACK, BUT NOW HE MUST DECIDE -- TAKE OXYGEN OR HEAD BACK DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. HE'S GOT THE NIGHT TO THINK ABOUT IT. TOMORROW MORNING, RUSSELL WANTS AN ANSWER. BUT FOR NOW, THE EXPEDITION LEADER HAS OTHER THINGS ON HIS MIND. HE SPENT THE DAY SEARCHING FOR A GROUP OF ITALIANS. TWO ARE STILL MISSING. BUT HE HAS NEWS. SO YOUR FRIEND IS AT OUR CAMP, 7-9, AND WEAK OF OXYGEN AND COMING DOWN, OKAY? OKAY. THE MAN HAS BEEN IN THE DEATH ZONE FOR TWO DAYS AND IS LUCKY TO BE ALIVE. ONE MAN IS STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR, BUT NOW THE ITALIANS RECEIVE A CALL FROM THE MOUNTAIN. COMING DOWN. ALL COMING DOWN NOW. YEAH. OKAY. [ SPEAKING ITALIAN ] Narrator: IT SEEMS THAT ALL OF THE MISSING GROUP ARE SAFE. WHAT WAS THAT? OKAY, THANK YOU. GOOD NIGHT. THANK YOU. Narrator: BUT THE CELEBRATIONS ARE PREMATURE. IN A CRUEL CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY, THE TWO SEPARATE SIGHTINGS WERE OF THE SAME MAN. PIERANGELO IS STILL MISSING, PRESUMED DEAD. HIS NAME HAS BECOME THE LATEST ENTRY TO THE GRIM ROLL CALL OF EVEREST. STATIONED AT CAMP 3, JUST BELOW THE DEATH ZONE, TEAM 1 WILL SPEND THE NIGHT ON OXYGEN. IT'S THE MOMENT THEY'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. OLD HAND FRED HAS DONE THIS BEFORE. BE BRAVE. BUT IT'S THE FIRST TIME FOR NEW BOY ROD. Fred: BEST SLEEPING DRUG THERE IS. [ CHUCKLING ] [ AIR HISSING ] NO, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T. MORE. THERE. [ COUGHS ] WE HAVE TO SLEEP ON THESE AT 0.5 LITERS AN HOUR. IF WE DON'T, WE MAY NOT SURVIVE THE NIGHT. Narrator: NOW ON OXYGEN, TEAM 1 SHOULD SLEEP WELL. BUT ANOTHER MAN ON THE MOUNTAIN WILL BE UP ALL NIGHT WITH WORRY. TOMORROW, MOGENS MUST DECIDE -- TAKE OXYGEN OR GO BACK HOME, NEVER TO RETURN. Narrator: IT'S DECISION TIME FOR MOGENS. WITH OXYGEN, HE COULD REACH THE SUMMIT. WITHOUT IT, HE'LL HAVE TO TURN BACK. UP AND DOWN THE MOUNTAIN, THE ENTIRE EXPEDITION WAIT FOR HIS DECISION. MOGENS, HERE'S THE ANSWER. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD PERSUADE HIM? OH, I'D LOVE TO PERSUADE HIM. I THINK HE SHOULD JUST PUT SOME OXYGEN ON AND GET TO THE SUMMIT. HEY, RUSS. HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS MORNING? APART FROM MY LUNGS, I'M FEELING ALL RIGHT, BUT ABOUT THE SAME CONDITION AS YESTERDAY. SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? WELL, IF I'M GOING UP, I THINK I NEED TO PUT ON SOME OXYGEN. I KNOW IT'S A HARD DECISION FOR YOU, BUT I'LL BE MUCH HAPPIER THAT YOU ACTUALLY GET TO THE SUMMIT. THE WAY MY LUNGS WERE WORKING, IT WOULD BE UNSAFE AND STUPID TO PROCEED ON WITHOUT OXYGEN. YEAH, GOOD FOR YOU, MOGENS. GOOD FOR YOU. BOLD DECISION, AND I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU. WE'LL FIND OUT WHERE YOUR MASK IS AND GET THAT TO YOU. HOPEFULLY, THAT'S GONNA GIVE ME THE EXTRA LUNG I'VE BEEN NEEDING SO WE CAN GO UP AND HAVE A LOOK AT HOW THE WORLD LOOKS LIKE FROM ITS HIGHEST POINT THERE. YEAH, GOOD ON HIM. HE PROBABLY HAD TO SLEEP ON THAT OVERNIGHT. BUT, YEAH. IT'S A BIT BORING COMING BACK HERE AND NOT GETTING VERY FAR. BUT HE'S STILL GONNA BE STRUGGLING. WE'LL SEE HOW HE DOES. MOGENS IS GOING ON O's. [ CHUCKLES ] GOOD ON HIM. I'M STOKED. HARD CALL FOR HIM TO MAKE, BUT I'M REALLY PLEASED THAT HE'S DECIDED TO. Tim: JUST LIKE HIM, IT'S BEEN EATING ME UP FOR A YEAR NOW, WHAT'S UP THERE, SO I CAN JUST IMAGINE WHAT IT'S BEEN DOING TO HIM. THIS IS ONLY MY SECOND ATTEMPT. THIS IS HIS THIRD. SO, HATS OFF TO HIM, MAN. HE'S GOT MY RESPECT, WITH O's OR WITHOUT O's. Narrator: MOGENS IS ON THE SUMMIT TEAM. SO, TOO, IS 71-YEAR-OLD YANAGI. HIS THROAT HAS CLEARED UP, AND RUSSELL'S GIVEN HIM THE GREEN LIGHT. MOST CLIMBERS CARRY TWO OXYGEN TANKS ON SUMMIT DAY. IT'S JUST ENOUGH TO GET THEM THERE AND BACK. BUT YANAGI WILL BE ON THE MAXIMUM FLOW AT ALL TIMES AND USE THREE BOTTLES. HE'LL HAVE TO RELY ON A SHERPA TO CARRY THE EXTRA LOAD. AT CAMP 3, ALL OF TEAM 1 ARE FIGHTING FIT, BUT NOW THEY ENTER THE DEATH ZONE. AT 26,000 FEET, OXYGEN LEVELS ARE 1/3 OF THOSE AT SEA LEVEL. TO SURVIVE, THE BODY BEGINS TO DIGEST ITS OWN FAT AND MUSCLE CONTENT. THE CLOCK IS TICKING. EVERY MINUTE SPENT IN THE DEATH ZONE IS DANGEROUS. FOR HALF THE TEAM, IT'S THEIR FIRST TIME THIS HIGH. ROD HOLDS A RECORD FOR CLIMBING ALL THE HIGHEST PEAKS IN EUROPE, BUT HE'S NEVER PUT HIS BODY IN SO MUCH DANGER OR PUSHED IT TO THESE EXTREMES. Rod: AND I'VE GOT TWO KIDS. I'LL CERTAINLY BE CONSIDERING THEM EVERY SINGLE MOVE I MAKE UPWARDS. BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, THEY'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME, SO IT'S A MATTER OF BALANCING THOSE ISSUES WITH CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN. Narrator: UP HERE, THE CLIMBERS LOSE A LITER OF WATER IN BREATH AND SWEAT EVERY HOUR. AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY OXYGEN THEY'VE BEEN SO DESPERATE FOR ONLY MAKES THINGS WORSE. TO STOP IT FROM FREEZING, ALL THE MOISTURE HAS BEEN REMOVED, SO THE AIR THEY'RE BREATHING IS BONE-DRY. VERY SOON, DEHYDRATION STARTS TO SET IN. IT CAN LEAD TO DIZZINESS AND CONFUSION. IT CAN ALSO TRIGGER A LOSS OF BODY TEMPERATURE AND RESULT IN FROSTBITE. THE CLIMBERS MUST KEEP DRINKING. IT'S A COMBINATION OF SOGGY TEA AND ORANGE JUICE. IT TASTES LIKE [BLEEP] BUT...ESSENTIAL FOR ACCLIMATIZATION. OH, DEAR. THERE'S A BODY THERE. OH, NO. I'VE JUST SEEN A BODY. I WANT TO GO. I DON'T WANT TO SEE A BODY. IT'S BAD KARMA. Narrator: THIS UNKNOWN MOUNTAINEER HAS DIED IN THE MIDDLE OF CAMP 4 -- THE CLIMBERS' LAST STOP BEFORE THE SUMMIT. IT'S A REMINDER, IF EVER ONE WERE NEEDED, OF THE DANGERS THEY FACE. Tim: IT'S SAD, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, HE COULDN'T BE DEAD FOR MORE THAN A FEW DAYS. SO IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD THING TO SEE BEFORE YOU'RE READY TO GO UP FOR YOUR SUMMIT PUSH. IT JUST KIND OF PUTS A BAD OMEN OVER THE CAMP. Rod: THE FIRST THING I FELT IS REALLY SORRY FOR HIM. SECOND THING I FELT IS I FELT REALLY SORRY FOR HIS FAMILY. I'VE GOT A FAMILY, AND BECAUSE OF THAT, I FELT, I SUPPOSE, A BIT NERVOUS. AND I'M WONDERING WHY HE DIED, BECAUSE IF HE CAN DIE, WE CAN DIE.
