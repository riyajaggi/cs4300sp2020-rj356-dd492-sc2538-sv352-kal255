 YOU LOSE ONE GLOVE, YOU LOSE ONE HAND. Narrator: THE SUMMIT ASSAULT HAS BEGUN. [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] BUT AT 23,000 FEET, ALTITUDE AND ATTITUDE SUDDENLY COLLIDE. Russell: If you want to get to the summit, YOU GOT TO GET YOUR [BLEEP] TOGETHER, MAN. BACK IN L.A., HE'D BE ON THE GROUND. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: ON THE SUMMIT OF THE WORLD'S HIGHEST MOUNTAIN, DAVID TAIT AND PHURBA TASHI ARE ATTEMPTING A WORLD FIRST -- A DOUBLE TRAVERSE OF EVEREST. [ CHEERING ] TO SET THE RECORD, BRITISH CLIMBER DAVID AND SHERPA PHURBA HAVE TO CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN TWICE --

 ONCE FROM TIBET, AND ONCE FROM NEPAL. SUMMIT. CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR 12th SUMMIT, AND, DAVID, CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR SECOND. THEY REACH THE SUMMIT FROM THE TIBETAN NORTH SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN. NOW THEY'RE ABOUT TO STEP OVER THE TOP AND DESCEND THE SOUTH SIDE INTO NEPAL. AFTER A FEW DAYS' REST, THEY'LL HEAD BACK THE WAY THEY CAME -- AN INCREDIBLE 2 SUMMITS IN 10 DAYS. PHURBA TASHI, DO YOU COPY? Narrator: PHURBA KNOWS THE NORTH SIDE LIKE THE BACK OF HIS HAND, BUT HE'S NEVER BEEN ON THE SOUTH SIDE. HE'S FILMING ON SHERPA CAM, AND DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE SEES. PHURBA CAN'T SEE ANYONE COMING UP ON THE SOUTH SIDE. Narrator: PHURBA HAD RELIED ON SAFETY ROPES BEING IN PLACE TO GUIDE HIM DOWN, BUT BAD WEATHER ON THE SOUTH SIDE HAS PINNED CLIMBERS DOWN, AND THE ROPES AREN'T THERE. HE'S HAVING TO ASK DIRECTIONS. FIRST THEY MUST DESCEND 200 VERTICAL FEET TO THE HILLARY STEP, THE MOST DANGEROUS AND TECHNICAL PART OF THEIR CLIMB, THEN CREEP ALONG THE KNIFE-EDGE RIDGE TO THE SOUTH SUMMIT AND CLAMBER DOWN TO THE BALCONY ON THEIR WAY TO HIGH CAMP 4. Phurba: ALL RIGHT, DAVID. Narrator: THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ROPE THEMSELVES TOGETHER FOR THE DESCENT. IF ONE FALLS, THE OTHER MUST TRY TO SAVE HIM. [ COUGHING ] IT'S OLD-FASHIONED CLIMBING -- TWO MEN, A COIL OF ROPE, AND THE MOUNTAIN. THANK YOU. 8,000 FEET BELOW THEM AT ADVANCE BASE CAMP, THE REST OF RUSSELL'S CLIMBERS ARE ON EDGE. PERFECT. THANK YOU. I'M HEARING A LOT OF BELLS GOING OFF THIS MORNING. EVERYBODY YELLING AND SCREAMING "SUMMIT!" I MEAN, IT KIND OF MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD INSIDE THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE SUMMITING UP THERE, BUT A HUGE SIDE OF ME JUST WANTS TO BE UP THERE. Narrator: THE FIRST TEAM OF CLIMBERS LEAVE FOR THE SUMMIT IN 24 HOURS. I JUST CAN'T WAIT. JUST CAN'T WAIT TO GET UP THERE AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, GET BACK DOWN IT. I'VE NEVER BEEN ABOVE 7,500 METERS. IN FACT, ALL THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN ABOVE 8,000 METERS. THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS WE'RE ALL PRETTY, I THINK, IN TERMS OF HEALTH, 100%. YEAH? YEAH, MAYBE. 100%? I DON'T THINK WE COULD BE IN A BETTER POSITION FOR A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT ATTEMPT. Tim: IT'S LIKE THE DAY BEFORE WE'RE LEAVING -- IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM. Narrator: ON THE SUMMIT, THE TIME HAS COME. DAVID AND PHURBA ARE GOING OVER THE TOP, INTO THE UNKNOWN AND OUT OF RADIO CONTACT. PHURBA TASHI? PHURBA TASHI, DO YOU COPY? Narrator: IT'S NOW HIT OR MISS IF ANYONE PICKS UP THEIR TRANSMISSIONS. PHURBA, PHURBA, DO YOU COPY? [ STATIC ] Narrator: THEY NO LONGER HAVE RUSSELL ON THEIR SIDE. DAVID, DO YOU COPY? [ STATIC ] Narrator: DAVID AND PHURBA HAVE BEEN IN THE DEATH ZONE SINCE YESTERDAY MORNING. THEY'VE BEEN IN RADIO CONTACT WITH RUSSELL EVERY INCH OF THE WAY, BUT NOW THEY'RE IN A RADIO SHADOW BEHIND THE MOUNTAIN. ON ALL RUSSELL'S EXPEDITIONS, RADIO COMMUNICATION IS A VITAL LIFELINE, AND NOW HE CAN'T CONTACT THE TRAVERSE TEAM. AT ADVANCE BASE CAMP, RUSSELL IS WORKING BLIND. HE'S FORCED TO RELY ON THE SOUTH SIDE EXPEDITION LEADERS FOR NEWS OF HIS MEN. SOUTH SIDE, SOUTH SIDE? DO YOU COPY? Narrator: BUT SOUTH BASE CAMP COMMUNICATIONS ARE NOTORIOUSLY BAD. [ STATIC ] YEAH, SORRY, SUSIE, I CAN'T HEAR YOU. BUT I WILL CALL YOU AGAIN IN MAYBE ONE HOUR'S TIME. HIS MEN ARE SOMEWHERE ON EVEREST. HE CAN'T WAIT. RUSSELL TRIES ANOTHER EXPEDITION LEADER HIGHER UP THE MOUNTAIN. NO ONE CAN REACH THEM. IF THEY'RE STILL ALIVE, PHURBA AND DAVID SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE HILLARY STEP AND THE BALCONY, WHERE THIS YEAR'S FIXED ROPES START. IT'S THE DEADLIEST STRETCH OF THE SOUTH ROUTE ON EVEREST. [ INDISTINCT RADIO CONVERSATION ] IT'S TAKING TOO LONG. YEAH, KENTON. THEY'RE ON THE NEW ROPE. Narrator: AFTER 12 HOURS OF NONSTOP CLIMBING, DAVID AND PHURBA HAVE FINALLY REACHED THIS YEAR'S SAFETY ROPES. TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ENTHUSIASM FROM OTHER COMMERCIAL OPERATORS ON THE SOUTH SIDE TO BE PASSING ON COMMUNICATIONS AND HELPING US FOR THIS PROJECT. IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD. Narrator: DAVID AND PHURBA ARE ON THE ROPES, BUT STILL FAR FROM SAFETY. THEY'RE ENTERING THE SOUTH COL, A BARREN EXPANSE OF ROCK SURROUNDED BY VERTICAL DROPS. THE SOUTH COL TAKES LIVES. DAVID AND PHURBA ARE WALKING INTO A GRAVEYARD. IN THE WORST CLIMBING DISASTER ON EVEREST, EIGHT PEOPLE DIED HERE ON ONE DEADLY DAY. THIS IS NO PLACE TO BE CAUGHT OUT IN THE OPEN. THEY'VE GOT TO FIND SHELTER AT THE FIRST CAMP AND GET OUT OF THE DEATH ZONE. Narrator: DAVID TAIT AND PHURBA TASHI ARE ON TARGET TO ACHIEVE A WORLD-FIRST DOUBLE TRAVERSE OF EVEREST. THEY'VE SPOTTED HIGH CAMP 4. FINALLY THEY FIND THE FIRST OF THIS YEAR'S SOUTH SIDE CLIMBERS, TRAPPED HERE BY BAD WEATHER AT 26,000 FEET. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN, RUSSELL BRICE IS IMPATIENT FOR NEWS. JUST SAY AGAIN. Narrator: IT'S A MONUMENTAL ACHIEVEMENT FOR PHURBA AND DAVID TO MAKE IT OVER THE MOUNTAIN. Man: HELLO. Phurba: HELLO. BUT IN THE DEATH ZONE, THERE'S NO FANFARE, JUST HOT WATER. THANK YOU. HOW YOU DOING? GOOD. GOOD. YOU GOING TO CAMP 3, OR YOU STAY HERE? CAMP 2, OKAY. Narrator: CAMP 4 IS NO PLACE TO LINGER. DAVID AND PHURBA MUST GET DOWN TO A SAFE ALTITUDE BY NIGHTFALL. NEWS OF THEIR SAFE ARRIVAL IS RELAYED TO THE NORTH SIDE. DAVID AND PHURBA ARE A STEP CLOSER TO A SUCCESSFUL FIRST TRAVERSE. ALL RIGHT, I DIDN'T COPY THAT, BUT I UNDERSTAND PHURBA'S GOING TO CALL WHEN HE'S LEAVING SOUTH COL, OVER. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] Man: CONGRATULATIONS, GOOD JOB. Phurba: YES, YES. PHURBA. [ PHURBA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] YEAH, PHURBA. I CAN HEAR YOU, BUT NOT VERY WELL. BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE AT SOUTH COL, AND THAT YOU'LL CALL WHEN YOU'RE LEAVING, OVER. PHURBA, AT CAMP 3 I CAN TALK TO YOU. I WAS TALKING TO KENTON THERE, SO HE SAID HE'LL HAVE DRINKS WAITING FOR YOU AND WE CAN TALK TO YOU THERE, OVER. Phurba: THANK YOU. YOU TOO. NOW THERE'S MANY MORE PEOPLE, AND THEY'LL DROP DOWN NOW TO CAMP 3, WHICH IS NOT GOING TO TAKE THEM VERY LONG. AND THEY'LL COME TO KENTON. EVERYONE'S CHIPPING IN AND HELPING IN DIFFERENT WAYS. IT'S MUCH APPRECIATED. I'M SURE DAVE'S APPRECIATING IT. [ INDISTINCT RADIO CONVERSATION ] Narrator: BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR NEXT CHECKPOINT IS THE LHOTSE FACE... A TREACHEROUS WALL OF ICE-GLAZED ROCK. THEY MUST GRIND THEIR WAY DOWN IT TO THE WESTERN CWM AND THE NEXT CAMP. ON THE NORTH SIDE, THE REST OF THE EXPEDITION ARE MAKING FINAL PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR OWN SUMMIT ATTEMPTS. TEAM 1 LEAVES TOMORROW. WE CAN DO IT! YEAH! [ LAUGHS ] COMRADE. WE CAN DO IT! RRR. WHATEVER HAPPENS, WHEREVER YOU GO IN THE WORLD, YOU'LL ALWAYS NEED A PEE, WON'T YOU? WHOEVER YOU ARE. YOU'RE RIGHT. I THINK THE FIRST SIGNS OF MADNESS ARE COMING IN, ACTUALLY. Narrator: IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, ROD'S VIDEO DIARY HOME COULD BE HIS LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT. HI. ROD. IT'S ROD AGAIN. VIDEO DIARY. THIS IS A QUICK, TEMPORARY FAREWELL. GOT FIVE DAYS AHEAD OF US, AND I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT. IT'S GONNA BE REALLY DIFFICULT, PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY, BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY TO YOU GUYS, SASHA, JOHN T., LOVE YOU LOADS. LOVE YOU MORE THAN THIS MOUNTAIN. IN FACT, I LOVE ALL OF YOU MORE THAN THIS MOUNTAIN. AND I'M JUST DOING IT BECAUSE I'M HERE, IT'S THERE. NOT SO MUCH THE MATTER ON THE MOUNTAIN. BETTER TAKE SOME... Narrator: ROD'S CLIMBING PARTNER IS DARIUS VAICIULIS, A BUSINESSMAN FROM LITHUANIA. I AM WITH ROD -- TEAMMATE IN THE TENT, SO WE'RE ORGANIZING THE FOOD FOR OUR COMING SIX DAYS. [ SPEAKING LITHUANIAN ] Narrator: TIM CAN'T FOCUS ON HOME. HE'S ONLY GOT EYES FOR THE MOUNTAIN. SO NOW THIS YEAR, GOING UP, I'M DEFINITELY STRONGER, FASTER, AND MORE MENTALLY PREPARED, SO DON'T, UH... DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT INTO THIS! I'M DOING THIS [BLEEP] Narrator: ON THE SOUTH SIDE, DAVID AND PHURBA ARE INCHING THEIR WAY DOWN THE LHOTSE FACE TO THE WESTERN CWM. THEY'VE REACHED CAMP 3, AND HELP FROM MOUNTAIN GUIDE KENTON COOL. YEAH, ROGER. THEY DON'T WANT TO STOP ANYWHERE, SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT, OVER. ROGER. [ OXYGEN HISSING ] THEY STOPPED, HAD WATER WITH KENTON AND GONE. SO THAT MEANS NOT EXHAUSTED AND STILL STRONG AND RUNNING HARD. THAT'S GOOD. Narrator: FROM BEING LOST IN THE DEATH ZONE WITH NO ROPES OR RADIOS, DAVID AND PHURBA ARE NOW CLOSE TO SAFETY. SOON THEY'LL REACH CAMP 2 AT 21,000 FEET, THE SAME HEIGHT AS RUSSELL BRICE AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP ON THE NORTH SIDE. THEY'RE ON SCHEDULE. THIS IS PRETTY GOOD. THEY'RE PROBABLY ANOTHER HOUR AND A HALF, TWO HOURS TO CAMP 2, AND THEN THEY CAN RELAX. Narrator: IT LOOKS LIKE THE DOUBLE-TRAVERSE TEAM IS ON TARGET FOR WORLD-RECORD SUCCESS. Narrator: AFTER 18 HOURS OF CLIMBING, THE DOUBLE-TRAVERSE TEAM HAS FINALLY MADE IT TO SAFETY. THEY'RE JUST ABOVE CAMP 2. THIS MAN JUST SAVED OUR LIFE. [ CHUCKLES ] DRINKS AND BISCUITS. HALF AN HOUR OUT OF CAMP. JUST WHAT WE NEEDED. SO WHICH CAMP ARE YOU GOING DOWN? UH, WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE SECOND -- CAMP 2 ON THE SOUTH SIDE. AND I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS SUCH A LONG ROUTE. SINCE SUMMITING AT 6:00 THIS MORNING, PHURBA AND DAVID HAVE DESCENDED 1 1/2 VERTICAL MILES DOWN THE TOUGHEST PART OF THE SOUTH-SIDE ROUTE. IT WAS A WHOLE NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME. FIRST FROM THE SUMMIT, WE HAD NO ROPES. I CAN HONESTLY SAY I FELT SOME NERVES THERE. HONESTLY SAY. Narrator: THEY'VE BURNED MORE THAN 15,000 CALORIES -- FOUR TIMES AS MUCH AS A MARATHON RUNNER. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR LEGS, BUT MY LEGS DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG TO ME ANYMORE. I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS SUCH A LONG ROUTE. Phurba: WANT TO SAY ANYTHING TO BIG BOSS? [ CHUCKLES ] DON'T TEMPT ME. Narrator: TOMORROW, THEY'LL MAKE THEIR WAY DOWN TO BASE CAMP, WHERE THEY'LL REST FOR THREE DAYS BEFORE TURNING AROUND AND DOING IT ALL AGAIN. TONIGHT, THEY'LL SLEEP AT CAMP 2. SO ALL I KNOW IS WE'VE WORKED 6... 12, 18, 19 HOURS. Phurba: 19 HOURS. OHH. THAT'S A LOT. THAT'S A LOT. [ COUGHS ] Narrator: IT'S RUSSELL'S FIRST CHANCE TO SPEAK TO DAVID AND ASSESS HIS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL STATE, BUT DAVID'S ABOUT TO DROP A BOMBSHELL. WITHOUT WARNING, DAVID'S DECIDED TO GIVE UP. THE DOUBLE TRAVERSE LOOKS LIKE IT'S OVER. YEAH, OKAY, BUT, UH, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO BASE CAMP, OVER. Narrator: RUSSELL SIMPLY DOESN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE'S HEARD. SOUNDS LIKE DAVE'S NOT THAT KEEN TO BE COMING BACK, BUT THEN AGAIN, LAST NIGHT HE WASN'T THAT KEEN TO BE GOING OVER THE OTHER SIDE. SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS, AND CERTAINLY I NEED PHURBA BACK HERE, SO I THINK HE'LL BE KEEN TO COME BACK. SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. Narrator: MAY 16th. THE FIRST TEAM OF CLIMBERS LEAVES TODAY, AND DANISH ASTHMATIC MOGENS JENSEN, ON TEAM 2, IS JUST AN OBSERVER. PEOPLE ARE GETTING NERVOUS, PEOPLE ARE HAVING DOUBTS, AND THEN THEY HAVE TO BALANCE THAT WITH THE BELIEF, THE MOTIVATION, JUST SHEER WILLPOWER. SO YEAH, IT'S INTERESTING. IF YOU CAN LOOK INSIDE OF PEOPLE HEADS -- PEOPLE'S HEADS, YOU GET A LOT OF INTERESTING SCENARIOS GOING ON FOR SURE. Rod: I HAVEN'T SLEPT FOR THE LAST TWO NIGHTS BECAUSE EVEREST KEEPS ON FLASHING UP IN MY HEAD EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES. I WANT TO GO AS FAST AS POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW. SO EVERYTHING IS PACKED, ALMOST. I DO NOT WANT TO STAY HERE TO THINK. Tim: ONE YEAR WAITING, MAN. THIS IS IT. I'VE BEEN WAITING A YEAR FOR THIS DAY. Narrator: ON THE SOUTH SIDE, DAVID'S MADE HIS DECISION. HE'S NOT COMING BACK. ALL THAT'S LEFT NOW IS TO ORGANIZE HIS TRIP HOME. David: YEAH, YOU KEEP BREAKING UP, TOO. THERE'S JUST STUFF IN MY TENT AT ABC. I'D BE GRATEFUL. Russell: Yeah, David, HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'LL TAKE YOU TO GET DOWN TO BASE CAMP? ANOTHER TWO HOURS MAYBE. WE'LL HAVE BETTER COMMUNICATION IF YOU GO TO BASE CAMP, AND THEN WE CAN TALK ON THE TELEPHONE, OVER. WILL DO, MATE. SEE YOU IN A WHILE. DAVE'S NOT GOING TO COME BACK OVER THE TRAVERSE. FEELS AS THOUGH HE'S TOO TIRED, AND SO WE JUST NEED TO SORT OUT HOW WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH THE PERMITS AND BITS AND BOBS. SO I'LL TALK TO HIM ON THE PHONE WHEN HE GETS TO BASE CAMP. IT WAS ALWAYS ON THE CARDS SO, YOU KNOW, AND UNTIL A PERSON DOES THIS, YOU DON'T KNOW. SO THAT'S UP TO HIM. WE'LL TALK LATER. Narrator: NO REASONS, NO EXPLANATION, BUT THE WORLD'S FIRST DOUBLE TRAVERSE IS OFF. AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP, ZERO HOUR APPROACHES. BUT BEFORE TEAM 1 LEAVES FOR THE SUMMIT, RUSSELL BREAKS THE NEWS ABOUT DAVID. DAVID AND PHURBA DECIDED NOT TO COME BACK ON TRAVERSE, SO PHURBA WILL COME BACK BY ROAD, AND DAVID WILL GO HOME. Rod: FOR ME, I'M SHOCKED, BECAUSE DAVID'S VERY ORGANIZED. HE'S VERY DIRECTED IN EVERY SINGLE DECISION HE MAKES. AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE HE PROBABLY HAD A VERY GOOD CHAT WITH HIS WIFE AND HIS FAMILY ON THE SUMMIT, AND HE SUDDENLY THOUGHT, "IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK. NO MOUNTAIN'S WORTH RISKING YOUR LIFE." MY FIRST REACTION WAS LIKE, "AT LEAST GIVE IT A COUPLE DAYS," YOU KNOW, "WAIT TWO, THREE DAYS, THEN SEE HOW YOU FEEL, "AND THEN COME BACK. "STICK TO THE PLAN. YOUR PLAN WAS ALWAYS TO GO OVER AND COME BACK," AND HE DIDN'T DO THAT. SO FOR ME, IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SWALLOW. WHY WOULDN'T YOU WAIT? David: THE REASON I'VE DECIDED NOT TO GO BACK UP AGAIN WITH PHURBA WAS I WAS CONTINUALLY BEING CONFRONTED WITH EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS SUPERIOR IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY WAY. WE'D DONE THE TRAVERSE EQUALLY, BUT FROM THAT POINT ON, IF WE HAD GONE BACK FOR A SECOND TIME, HE WOULD'VE HAD TO DEFER TO ME AT SOME POINT SIMPLY BECAUSE I PAY FOR IT. EVERYTHING ACHES. Narrator: WHEN THEY WOKE UP AT CAMP 2, PHURBA WAS FULLY RECOVERED, BUT DAVID WAS STILL EXHAUSTED. OH, WHAT A LONG WAY THAT WAS. Phurba: YEAH. SOME DRINK. YEAH. THEN YOU'LL GO DOWN? YEAH, LET ME GO DOWN THEN. THANK GOD. IF WE'D REACHED THE SUMMIT, I COULD SEE THE SITUATION HYPOTHETICALLY IN MY MIND. I'D TAP HIM ON THE SHOULDER, HE'D STAND BACK, I'D STAND ON THE SUMMIT, AND THEN I'D SAY, "YEAH, I WAS THE FIRST PERSON." BUT IT WOULDN'T BE A LEGITIMATE FIRST PERSON. IT'S NOT REALLY AUTHENTIC. IT WOULD'VE BEEN A FRAUD, FRANKLY, BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT PHURBA'S THE BEST SHERPA, ONE OF THE STRONGEST MEN OUT THERE. EVERYBODY WOULD'VE KNOWN HE WOULD'VE HAD TO HAVE LET ME GO FIRST. I GAVE UP ON IT WHEN HE STARTED TO LEAD. Narrator: IT'S AN ELITE GROUP THAT SUMMITS EVEREST, BUT AN EVEN MORE EXCLUSIVE CLUB THAT MAKES IT TWICE. NOBODY COULD TAKE AWAY FROM HIM THAT THAT WAS HIS SECOND SUMMIT, YOU KNOW? HE SUMMITED EVEREST FOR THE SECOND TIME. YOU KNOW, MY HAT'S OFF TO HIM. Narrator: NOW IT'S TIME FOR MOUNTAIN MAVERICK TIM TO CONFRONT HIS OWN DEMONS. I CAN DEAL WITH SO MUCH [BLEEP] AND I'M NOT PAYING HIM $42,000 TO BE MY FRIEND. DO THINGS AS WE [BLEEP] TELL YOU, OVER. Narrator: THE FIRST CLIMBERS LEAVE FOR THE SUMMIT IN LESS THAN AN HOUR, AND THE ENTIRE EXPEDITION GATHERS FOR RUSSELL'S FINAL BRIEFING. YOU LOSE ONE GLOVE, YOU LOSE ONE HAND. I GUESS YOU WANT TO CALL IT A PEP TALK. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE THE OPPOSITE. ABOVE 8,000 METERS, WE HAVE VERY LIMITED TIME TO SURVIVE. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. TREAT IT AS DANGEROUS. PEOPLE DIE UP THERE, PEOPLE LOSE FINGERS, PEOPLE LOSE TOES, AND NOW'S YOUR CHANCE TO TURN AROUND. Narrator: IT'S CRUNCH TIME FOR THE CLIMBERS. HAVE THE COURAGE TO GO ON, OR THE WISDOM TO GO HOME. IF THEY ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE, TEAM 1 WILL LEAD THE WAY UP TO NORTH COL AT 23,000 FEET. THEY'LL SPEND THE NIGHT HERE BEFORE HEADING UP THROUGH CAMPS 2, 3, AND 4. IT'S A FIVE-DAY TREK TO THE SUMMIT. THERE'S ONE SHERPA WITH EACH PERSON. THE SHERPA WILL STAY WITH YOU, BUT IT'S NOT THE SHERPA'S JOB -- IF YOU WANT TO GO AND DIE ON THE MOUNTAIN, IT'S NOT THE SHERPA'S JOB TO DIE WITH YOU. I'M SITTING AT NORTH COL TO BE WATCHING, CALCULATING. CALCULATING OXYGEN, CALCULATING TIME. YOU PAID ME A LOT OF MONEY TO LOOK AFTER YOUR LIFE. LAST YEAR, A BIG ARGUMENT WITH TIM -- ONE AND A HALF HOUR ARGUING WITH ARROGANT MAN... ...AND DOESN'T WANT TO COME BACK, MAKES A BIG PROBLEM. Tim: YOU KNOW, HE THINKS THAT I WAS ARROGANT AND DIDN'T TURN AROUND, AND HE'S GOT EVERY RIGHT TO THINK THAT. YEAH, I PUSHED MY LUCK FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF. Russell: DON'T ARGUE WITH ME AGAIN, TIM. IF I SAY NO, IT'S NO. YOU KNOW? I DON'T CARE IF YOU DIE. Tim: I'M NOT PAYING RUSSELL TO BE MY BUDDY OR BE MR. NICE GUY. I'M PAYING HIM TO GET ME UP THAT MOUNTAIN AND GET ME DOWN. Russell: I'M GONNA SAY GOOD LUCK, GOOD MOUNTAINEERING, BE SAFE, BE STRONG, AND LET'S COME HOME AND CELEBRATE. "NOW THE TIME HAS COME," THE WALRUS SAID. [ CHUCKLES ] [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] NUMBER 3. OKAY. STRENGTHEN ON UP. Narrator: YEARS OF TRAINING AND A LIFETIME OF DREAMING ARE OVER. STAY STRONG. IT'S TIME TO CLIMB. SEE YOU. THANKS. TEAM 1 IS HEADING UP TO THE NORTH COL. AFTER 8 WEEKS OF LIVING AT ALTITUDE, IT SHOULD BE AN EASY FIVE HOURS. BUT TIM'S WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE BEFORE HE'S EVEN LEFT. HE'S TAKEN TIME TO EAT LUNCH AND SAY FINAL FAREWELLS TO THE KITCHEN STAFF AND TEAM 2. OKAY. KONICHIWA. [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] THE NEXT TIME HE'LL SEE MOGENS IS IF THEY BOTH MAKE IT BACK ALIVE. LET'S DO IT, BRO. YEAH. LET'S GET IT ON. YEAH. BARELY OUT OF ADVANCED BASE CAMP, TIM BUMPS INTO A CLIMBER HE MET EARLIER THIS YEAR ON ANOTHER MOUNTAIN. WHEN'D YOU SUMMIT? THIS MORNING? NO, I SUMMITED THREE DAYS AGO. AND THEN PULLED OUR CAMPS THE OTHER DAY. AND WENT UP TO THE NORTH COL WITH THE SHERPAS TO GET THE LAST CAMP TODAY. RIGHT ON, MAN. HE'S COME WITH THE LATEST NEWS FROM THE SUMMIT. A GUY DIED RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. LIKE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES. WE WERE COMING DOWN THAT SUMMIT SNOW SLOPE, AND -- THE CZECH? NO, I THINK HE WAS JAPANESE. OH, YEAH, WE HEARD. AND I JUST -- I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU DO? THEY WERE TRYING TO GET HIM DOWN, AND IT'S LIKE -- IT'S LIKE 11:00 IN THE AFTERNOON -- 11:00 IN THE DAY, AND WE JUST, LIKE, WALKED OVER, AND WE'RE LIKE, "DUDES, YOU GOT TO ABANDON YOUR FRIEND, OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA BE SIX MORE LIKE THAT." THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH ME AND DAVID SHARP LAST YEAR. IT'S A TOUGH CALL. I FELT LIKE A [BLEEP] JUST WALKING OVER, BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO. THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN GET A BODY DOWN FROM THAT HEIGHT. THE REST OF TEAM 1 IS MAKING GOOD TIME. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY TO NORTH COL, AND MILES AHEAD OF TIM. I'M NOT WORRIED. I'LL BE THERE BY DINNER. I'M NEVER LATE FOR DINNER. I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M OFF THE MARK. Narrator: BUT IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE HE'S IN TROUBLE. IT'S BACK TO YOUR OLD TRICKS. GET YOUR [BLEEP] TOGETHER, MAN. BE ON TIME. [ COUGHING ] Narrator: L.A. BIKER TIM MEDVETZ IS ON HIS WAY TO THE NORTH COL, BUT HE'S FINDING IT MUCH HARDER THAN HE EXPECTED. MY HEART RATE IS JUST PUMPING SO HARD. I MEAN, YOU CAN FEEL IT HITTING YOUR RIB CAGE, IT'S HITTING SO HARD. IT'S LIKE HITTING A RED LINE ON A MOTORCYCLE. Narrator: HE'S HIT THE WALL. Tim: THE MOTORS ARE SCREAMING, AND THOSE PISTONS ARE JUST SLAPPING UP AGAINST CYLINDERS, BAM, BAM, BAM, HITTING THE HEADS. THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WITH MY HEART. YOU GOT TO STOP, LET IT SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT, THEN MOVE A LITTLE BIT MORE. [ PANTING ] Narrator: THE REST OF TIM'S TEAM ARRIVED AT CAMP 1 WELL BEFORE HIM AND ARE PREPARING FOR THE NEXT LEG OF THE SUMMIT PUSH TOMORROW MORNING. [ COUGHING ] THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH. KEEP ONE AND JUST THROW UP ONE RED BAG. FOR TOMORROW? TOMORROW WE NEED 4 LITERS AT LEAST. [ COUGHING ] I'M DREADING THAT TOMORROW. YOU CAN SEE OUR TENTS RIGHT AT THE TOP. EACH STEP IS A STEP TOWARDS THE SUMMIT. WE NEED AS MUCH SNOW AS POSSIBLE. DON'T EAT YELLOW SNOW! REMEMBER THAT. THE BEAUTIFUL VIEWS HERE. YOU SEE? [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] Narrator: TIM'S BEEN STRUGGLING ON THE NORTH COL ICE CLIFF FOR NEARLY FIVE HOURS. MAKE SURE HE STEPS ON THIS RED ROPE. NOW HIS ROUTE UP HIS BLOCKED. A TEAM OF CLIMBERS ARE MAKING THEIR WAY SLOWLY DOWN. Man: OKAY? KEEP GOING. GET IN ACROSS. THAT WAS THE BIG HURDLE. YOU SHOULD HAVE GOT THAT ON FILM. Narrator: ONE OF THE TEAM IS SNOW-BLIND. THEY'RE LOWERING HIM DOWN STEP BY STEP. GOOD. LEFT FOOT STEP. RIGHT FOOT STEP. YOU LOOK AROUND AT YOUR TEAMMATES, AND YOU BETTER HOPE YOU CAN COUNT ON THEM BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NEED THEM UP TOP. YOU KNOW? EVEN THE BEST CLIMBERS IN THE WORLD CAN'T CLIMB THIS THING ALONE. YEAH, LET'S GO. Narrator: BUT TIM'S TEAM IS WAY AHEAD OF HIM, AND NOW HIS ABSENCE IS NOTICED. TIM, TIM? YOU GOT A RADIO? SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO DRIFT AWAY, AND HAVING YOUR MUSIC IN ONE EAR. LEAVE THE OTHER EAR OPEN SO YOU CAN HEAR THE RADIO. IT'S TAKING MORE THAN FIVE HOURS, AND I ALREADY TOLD TIM BEFORE HE LEFT, PLEASE GET HIS ACT TOGETHER. I'M NOT IMPRESSED WITH THAT. YOU KNOW, TIM'S BEEN WALKING AROUND BEING THE BIG SUPERHERO BECAUSE HE WAS HERE LAST YEAR. HE'S VERY RELAXED. ALL-TIME NUMBER ONE? I HAVE TO SAY EMINEM. EMINEM, "LOSE YOURSELF." THAT'S A GOOD ONE. HE KIND OF SINGS ABOUT HIS ONE OPPORTUNITY, HIS ONE BREAK TO MAKE IT ALL HAPPEN. SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY. HE'S NOT PERFORMING, AND I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THAT. THIS IS MY SHOT, MAN. HE CAN COME HOME. I DON'T MIND. LET'S GET IT ON. BAM! [BLEEP] Darius: THIS OKAY? THAT WAS CLOSE. VERY COZY IN HERE NOW. IT'S GETTING DARK NOW. WE CAN SEE THE DARKNESS COMING IN. SO TIM'S NOT HERE YET. THAT'S A BIT OF A WORRY, ISN'T IT? TIM SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE BY NOW, YOU KNOW? HE'S [BLEEP] GETTING THERE AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT AND WHEN THE SUN'S GONE, AND HE SHOULD HAVE LEFT EARLIER. I TOLD HIM THAT. NO SYMPATHY AT ALL. I DON'T CARE. I DON'T CARE FOR HIM AT ALL. [ CHUCKLES ] HE JUST MAKES IT HARDER FOR HIMSELF ALL THE TIME. STUPID, STUPID MAN. YEAH. [ BELCHING ] [ HEAVING ] Narrator: TIM'S IN ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE. IT'S TAKEN HIM MORE THAN THE ALLOTTED TIME TO REACH THE NORTH COL. [ COUGHING ] [ PANTING ] THE SECOND HALF JUST WIPED ME OUT. THAT'S THE HARDEST NORTH COL PUSH SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE. [ SNIFFLES ] I DON'T KNOW. I THINK I JUST NEED SOME FOOD OR SOMETHING. I JUST FELT NAUSEOUS ALL DAY. [ COUGHING ] TOO SLOW. TOO INTERESTED IN FOOD. STEWED DUMPLINGS? Tim: LEAVE IT IN THERE A LITTLE BIT MORE, PLEASE. SURE. I NEVER LOSE MY APPETITE. IT'S A GOOD THING. YOU KNOW, TO GET -- YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN. TO GET A 250-POUND BODY UP THAT HIGH, I NEED FUEL. MAYBE YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM SLOWS DOWN SO ALL THAT STUFF JUST SITS IN YOUR GUT. TAKES THAT MUCH LONGER TO WORK ITS WAY THROUGH. TRUE. TIM, TIM, DO YOU COPY? THE DISAPPEARING TIM. ONLY HE'S NOT TAKING MUCH NOTICE, IS HE? WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT? HE WANTS TO CHASTISE YOU. MAN, HE'D BETTER GET OFF MY BACK, MAN. WELL... HE'S ABOUT TO GET ON IT, I THINK. WANT TO DO IT NOW AND GET IT OVER AND DONE WITH? YEAH, GIVE ME THE RADIO. [ COUGHING ] UH, TIM TO RUSS AT ABC. TIM TO RUSS. Narrator: THE FIRST CLIMBING TEAM ARE ON THEIR WAY TO THE TOP OF THE WORLD. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] NOW AT 23,000 FEET, WITH FOUR DAYS OF BRUTAL CLIMBING AHEAD OF THEM, THEY'RE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CONQUERING EVEREST IS ALL ABOUT. GETS HARDER NOW. EVERY DAY GETS HARDER AND HIGHER AND TOUGHER AND ROUGHER. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] UH, TIM TO RUSS AT ABC. TIM TO RUSS. IN THE MESS TENT, THE PRESSURE IS MOUNTING. TIM MEDVETZ CAN'T AVOID RUSSELL BRICE ANY LONGER. YEAH, WOODY AND DEANO WANTED ME TO CALL YOU. IS THAT TIM? YEAH, GO AHEAD. 10-4. IT'S ME. YEAH, I'M NOT SO IMPRESSED WITH YOUR PERFORMANCE TODAY. YEAH, NEITHER AM I. BUT I STILL MADE YOUR FIVE-HOUR MARK. I DON'T THINK SO. We told you to go earlier today, and you wanted to just sit here and eat food and stuff, and then you're making late. I'M PRETTY [BLEEP] OFF, ACTUALLY. [ CLEARS THROAT ] I HAD A LITTLE ROUGH DAY TODAY, BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE ON THE MARK TOMORROW. Don't worry. WELL, YOU BETTER TALK TO DEAN AND WOODY ABOUT THAT. I warned you. If you want to get to the summit, YOU'VE GOT TO [BLEEP] GET YOUR [BLEEP] TOGETHER, MAN. YEAH, 10-4, RUSS. You can't just continue to try and be arrogant and think that it's all going to happen naturally. So you talk to Dean and Woody. THEY CAN MAKE THE DECISION WHETHER YOU GO UP TOMORROW OR WHETHER YOU COME DOWN, OVER. Woody: WE'RE OPEN TO BRIBES. Y-YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT? YOU'RE TURNING ME AROUND? OR YOU'RE LEAVING THIS DECISION TO WOODY AND DEAN? Tim, what I'm telling you is to get your bloody act together AND STOP BLOODY [BLEEP] AROUND, YOU KNOW? You have to do things like everyone else. Stop being arrogant about it. AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT, THEN YOU GOT TO GET -- get out of the game. SO, YOU LEFT LATE AND THEN YOU GOT CAUGHT IN A TRAFFIC JAM. You know, do things as we bloody well tell you, over. YEAH, OVER. OKAY, 10-4. You talk to Dean and Woody. They're the ones that are going with you. I'M [BLEEP] OFF WITH IT, MAN. AND I DON'T MIND TO BRING YOU DOWN IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PERFORM, OVER. Dean: TIM, I THINK WOODY MENTIONED TO YOU BEFORE, 9:00 TOMORROW, OKAY? FROM NOW ON, THE GROUP MOVES TOGETHER. THE FURTHER THE GROUP GETS SPREAD OUT, YOU KNOW, BY LEAVING LATER, IT MAKES IT HARDER FOR US IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG OR WHATEVER. YEAH, RUSS, WOODY HERE. WE'LL CHASTISE HIM AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT HE PERFORMS BETTER TOMORROW. OTHERWISE, WE WILL BE TURNING HIM AROUND, OVER. I'M NOT GONNA GET INTO IT OVER THE RADIO, MAN, BUT HE'S GOT TO GET OFF MY [BLEEP] CASE. ALL DAY TODAY, CALLING ME AN ARROGANT [BLEEP] "I DON'T CARE IF YOU DIE."
