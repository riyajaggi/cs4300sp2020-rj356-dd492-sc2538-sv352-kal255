 GOT IN MY SLEEPING BAG, AND NEVER WENT TO SLEEP. Narrator: NOW RUSSELL MUST FIND TWO SAFE DAYS TO SUMMIT ON A MOUNTAIN WHERE STORMS CAN RISE IN A HEARTBEAT. Russell: THE ONLY THING THAT CAN PUSH ME AROUND IS THE WEATHER, AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S DOING. Narrator: THE PUSH FOR THE SUMMIT HAS COME DOWN TO FIVE CRITICAL DAYS. STANDING BETWEEN SUCCESS AND FAILURE IS THE DEATH ZONE AT 26,000 FEET. EVER, EVER, EVER. EVER, EVER, EVER. REST, REST, REST. EVER, EVER, EVER. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS

 EVER, EVER, EVER. EVER, EVER, EVER. REST, REST, REST. [ MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO ] Narrator: RUSSELL'S TEAM HAS FINISHED ACCLIMATIZING. [ COUGHING ] YEAH, EVERYBODY MADE IT UP. PERFECT. Man: WELL, YOU FEEL ASLEEP LIKE HALFWAY THERE. Narrator: THEY HAVE FORCED THEIR BODIES TO PRODUCE MORE RED BLOOD CELLS. EACH MAN CAN NOW ABSORB MORE OXYGEN PER BREATH, BUT THEIR LUNGS WILL ALWAYS CRAVE MORE. YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE EVEREST THING IS ABOUT A GAME OF HURRY UP AND WAIT. WE'VE BEEN DOWN AT BASE CAMP WAITING FOR A FEW DAYS TO ACCLIMATIZE. THEN WE COME HERE. WE HAVE TO WAIT HERE. WE ONLY SPEND ABOUT 10 DAYS ON THE MOUNTAIN IN TOTAL, YOU KNOW? 71 DAYS FOR 10 DAYS CLIMBING. IT'S A BIT CRAZY, HUH? STUPID GAME. Narrator: TWO GROUPS WILL MAKE THE FIVE-DAY, 8,000-FOOT SUMMIT CLIMB FROM ADVANCED BASE CAMP TO THE TOP OF THE WORLD. ALONG THE WAY, THE TEAMS WILL SPEND ONE NIGHT IN EACH OF THE FOUR HIGH CAMPS. JUST ABOVE CAMP 3, AT 26,000 FEET, THEY ENTER THE DEATH ZONE, WHERE OXYGEN LEVELS ARE A THIRD OF THOSE AT SEA LEVEL. WE TRIED TO BALANCE THE TEAMS AROUND A LITTLE BIT AS WELL. Narrator: RUSSELL HAS PUT THE STRONGEST CLIMBERS IN TEAM 1 AND THE REST OF HIS GROUP IN TEAM 2. LET'S START WITH THE FIRST TEAM. Narrator: TEAM 1 IS LED BY BILL CROUSE, A GUIDE WITH FOUR SUMMIT CLIMBS UNDER HIS BELT. TEAM 1 INCLUDES BRETT MERRELL, MOGENS JENSEN, FROM DENMARK, AND TERRY O'CONNOR, THE EXPEDITION DOCTOR. LEADING TEAM 2, GUIDE MARK WOODWARD HAS SUMMITED TWICE. TEAM 2 INCLUDES DOUBLE AMPUTEE MARK INGLIS, LOS ANGELES BIKER TIM MEDVETZ, AND MAX CHAYA, A MOUNTAINEER FROM LEBANON. RUSSELL NOW TEAMS UP HIS CLIMBERS WITH SHERPAS. YOU GOT TO PAY EXTRA BECAUSE YOU GOT PHURBA. WOODY'S BEEN TWO TIMES SUMMIT, AND PHURBA 10 TIMES. Narrator: IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG ON THE SUMMIT ATTEMPT, THESE MEN ARE THE BEST CHANCE FOR RUSSELL'S CLIMBERS TO GET DOWN ALIVE. TERRY, YOU'RE WITH KARSANG NAMGEL. BE OKAY THERE. BRETT -- WHERE'S BRETT? RIGHT HERE, PAL. YOU'RE WITH PHURA NURU. Brett: I STARTED THINKING, "WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?" MOGENS WITH TA SHI AGAIN. MARK, YOU'RE WITH DORJI SONAM. OH! TIM, YOU'RE WITH LAKPA NURU. WE HAVEN'T THANKED THE BOYS, SINCE THEY CAME DOWN YESTERDAY, FOR CARRYING DOUBLE LOADS, GETTING EVERYTHING READY. LET'S SAY THANKS TO THE GUYS BECAUSE THEY DID WORK HARD. Narrator: THE SHERPAS ARE BOTH FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO RUSSELL. MOST OF HIS OLD CLIMBING BUDDIES HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE MOUNTAIN. EVER, EVER, EVER. REST, REST, REST. Russell: WE KNOW IT'S DANGEROUS. YOU KNOW, YOU HOPE IT'S NOT YOU. BUT, IN MY LIFETIME, PROBABLY 80% OF MY MATES HAVE DIED FROM CLIMBING. AND, YOU KNOW... IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO SURVIVE THIS LONG, I SUPPOSE. Narrator: SINCE RECORDS BEGAN IN THE 1920s, 192 PEOPLE HAVE DIED ON THE MOUNTAIN. AND THAT'S WHERE THEY'VE STAYED. THE LAW OF EVEREST IS YOU'RE LEFT WHERE YOU DIE. Russell: MARK JENINGS -- HE WAS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. I FOUND HIS BODY JUST AT 8,200 METERS AND TRIED TO REVIVE HIM, BUT WITH NO SUCCESS. MICHAEL RHEINBERGER. [ Voice breaking ] VERY GOOD FRIEND. ALL UP HERE. Narrator: FOR EVERY THREE KILLED BY EVEREST, ONE IS A SHERPA. WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON IS DANGEROUS, YOU KNOW? YOU CAN DIE. AND I CAN'T HELP YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH YOURSELVES TO A LIMIT THAT WE CAN'T HELP YOU. IT'S NO USE GETTING TO THE SUMMIT AND SAYING, "WELL, I CAN'T GET DOWN." REMEMBER, THE MOUNTAIN WILL STAY HERE. WE'RE MERE MORTALS. THE SHERPAS THAT ARE HELPING US -- YOU SEE HOW IMMENSELY STRONG THEY ARE. BUT REMEMBER ALSO, THEY ARE MERE MORTALS AND THAT THEY ALSO HAVE FAMILIES AND THAT THEY HAVE LIVES. IT'S NOT THEIR JOB TO DIE ALONGSIDE YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR AMBITIONS. IF I SEE THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, I'M GONNA CALL THE SHERPAS AWAY. I WILL DEAL WITH THAT IN COURT LATER, AND YOU WILL DIE... 'CAUSE IT'S NOT THEIR JOB TO DIE FOR YOU. YOU CAN STILL PULL OUT NOW, GO HOME. YOU STILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO SAY, "NO, I'M NOT READY FOR THIS CHALLENGE," BUT I RECKON YOU ALL ARE. SO LET'S GIVE IT OUR BEST SHOT, AND LET'S BE SAFE AND BE CAREFUL. AND GOOD LUCK. Narrator: IN A FEW DAYS, A WEATHER WINDOW OPENS ON THE SUMMIT. TO REACH IT AND RETURN ALIVE, TEAM 1 MUST LEAVE ADVANCED BASE CAMP TOMORROW, TEAM 2, THE FOLLOWING DAY. SHOWER, SHAVE, TRIM THE NOSE HAIRS. Narrator: KNOWING THEY'RE ACTUALLY HEADED FOR THE SUMMIT IS SOBERING. THE CLIMBERS TAPE SOME VIDEO LETTERS HOME, KNOWING THESE WORDS COULD BE THEIR LAST. [ GRUNTS ] HI, EDGAR. HI, KELLY. HI, PUPA. HI, JOVIE. [ SPEAKING DANISH ] PBHT! LET'S GET TO THE TOP, GET DOWN, GET HOME. I MISS YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH. I'VE GOT PHOTOS OF ALL YOU GUYS FOR WHEN I'M MISSING YOU AND THINKING OF YOU. IT'S A LONG WAY AWAY FROM BEING HOME UPSTAIRS WITH YOU, MY DARLING, I CAN TELL YOU. [ SIGHS ] ALMOST THERE, MA. TAKE A LOOK. UP THERE -- THERE'S THE SUMMIT. BUT I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU AND, UH... UH... LOVE YOU, DARLING. SEE YOU LATER. BYE. [ SMOOCHES ] Narrator: TEAM 1 -- TERRY, MOGENS, AND BRETT -- PUSH FOR THE SUMMIT FIRST, FOLLOWED A DAY LATER BY TEAM 2. RUSSELL STAYS BEHIND TO DIRECT EVERY PHASE OF THE CLIMB. Russell: I SUPPOSE IT'S A REALLY EMOTIONAL DAY. I'M A LITTLE WORRIED FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. I'LL BE MUCH MORE RELIEVED NEXT MONDAY AND TUESDAY WHEN THESE GUYS START COMING DOWN -- HOPEFULLY, ALL IN ONE PIECE. HOPEFULLY, ALL IN ONE PIECE. EVER SINCE I WAS 8 YEARS OLD, EVER SINCE I WAS 8 YEARS OLD, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO CLIMB THIS MOUNTAIN. THIS IS THE LAST GREAT HUMAN ADVENTURE. Narrator: BRETT'S LAST SUMMIT ATTEMPT ENDED A YEAR AGO, WHEN EIGHT SLEEPLESS NIGHTS FORCED HIM HOME. OH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS. HEADING OUT THE DOOR, AND THEN I DECIDED THAT THIS PACK IS WAY TOO HEAVY. CHEESE. SOUP. Narrator: BRETT'S ACCLIMATIZATION HAS NOT GONE WELL... EVERY LITTLE BIT COUNTS, RIGHT? Narrator: ...AND HIS NERVES ARE ON EDGE. GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES. I'LL THINK OF ANOTHER REASON NOT TO LEAVE. YOU KNOW, I'D BE LYING TO SAY THAT I WASN'T A LITTLE SCARED. BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING IT OVER AND DONE WITH. Russell: BRETT IS LOSING A LOT OF WEIGHT. HE'S USING FAR TOO MUCH MENTAL ENERGY. AT HOME, HE'S ONE OF THE REAL TOUGH, TOUGH FIREMEN. BUT HERE HE'S JUST A MERE MORTAL. Narrator: MOGENS, THE DANISH CLIMBER, FIGHTS OTHER DEMONS. MOGENS IS AN ASTHMATIC, BUT STILL WANTS TO SUMMIT WITHOUT BOTTLED OXYGEN. Brett: MOGENS IS AN ANIMAL. HE'S A GENETIC ABNORMALITY. I'LL BE SEEING HIS BACK MOSTLY, YOU KNOW, AS IT GOES BY ME. Narrator: TERRY O'CONNOR IS AN E.R. DOCTOR FROM OREGON AND A SPECIALIST IN HIGH-ALTITUDE SICKNESS. Terry: I HAVE CONCERNS AS WELL, YOU KNOW. I'LL BE PUSHING MY OWN PERSONAL ENVELOPE IN A LOT OF WAYS ON THIS TRIP. SOMETHING TOTALLY UNPREDICTABLE CAN HAPPEN. AND HOW CAN YOU NOT BE A LITTLE BIT AFRAID OF THAT, RIGHT? [ LAUGHING ] SEE YOU UP THERE, BUDDY. Man: GOOD LUCK, MOGENS. THANK YOU. TAKE CARE. Man: BYE, MOGENS. TAKE CARE. Russell: MY PART IS TO PUT THE LOGISTICS IN PLACE AND THEN SORT OF WATCH OVER THEM A LITTLE BIT. BUT THEY'VE GOT TO DO THIS THEMSELVES. I CAN'T HELP THEM. OKAY, BUDDY. I'LL SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET BACK. WHAT'S UP, MAN? ALL RIGHT? YEAH, I'M PRETTY NERVOUS. I'M A BIT HYPED ABOUT THIS. YOU START THINKING, "WOW, NOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN." Brett: I GOT TO GET UP THAT HILL PRETTY SOON. [ INDISTINCT TALKING ] EVER, EVER, EVER. EVER, EVER, EVER. REST, REST, REST. EVER, EVER, EVER. Narrator: BECAUSE EVEREST IS 5 1/2 MILES HIGH, CONDITIONS CAN BE CALM AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP WHILE STORMS RAKE THE SUMMIT. CHOOSING THE BEST DAY TO CLIMB IS ALWAYS A GAMBLE. Russell: THERE'S A LITTLE... A LITTLE BIT MORE WIND ON THE SUMMIT, WHICH HAS PICKED UP TODAY, WHICH IS MEANT TO. BUT... I'VE GOT AN UNEASY FEELING, BUT A HAPPY FEELING THAT WE GOT IT RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW. WE MIGHT BE LUCKY. Narrator: FROM ADVANCED BASE CAMP, TEAM 1 TREKS UP A 1,000-FOOT ICE CLIFF TO NORTH COL. AT 23,000 FEET, NORTH COL IS THE BRIDGE BETWEEN EVEREST AND ITS NEIGHBOR MOUNTAIN, CHANGTSE. IT'S ALSO THE SITE OF CAMP 1. THE TEAM HAS ACCLIMATIZED HERE THREE TIMES BEFORE. BUT THIS TIME, INSTEAD OF TURNING BACK TO ABC, THEY'LL CONTINUE TO HEAD FOR THE SUMMIT THE NEXT MORNING. Russell: PEOPLE REALLY FEEL THE PRESSURE GOING UP TO NORTH COL, WHEN THEY'RE GOING UP THERE AND THEY'RE GOING TO THE SUMMIT -- "AM I MENTALLY PREPARED? AM I READY? BECAUSE THIS IS THE LAST TIME I'M COMING UP HERE." Terry: I THINK A LOT OF THE FITNESS THAT PEOPLE BRING WITH THEM -- IT REALLY IS A LOT OF MENTAL FITNESS. YOU JUST GET USED TO SUFFERING, FRANKLY. Brett: I USED TO DO THREE HOURS WITH 60, 65 POUNDS ON MY BACK ON THE STAIRS. AND THIS IS FIVE HOURS OF JUST BRUTAL CAN'T-CATCH-YOUR-BREATH. Narrator: ON MOGENS' LAST ATTEMPT, HE ALMOST SUMMITED, UNTIL FROSTBITE STOPPED HIM IN HIS TRACKS. FROM NORTH COL, IT'S A FOUR-DAY CLIMB TO THE SUMMIT. HOURS AFTER MOGENS AND TERRY ARRIVE, BRETT STRUGGLES INTO CAMP 1. I THINK SOMEBODY STUCK ROCKS IN MY PACK. THAT WAS A TOUGH CLIMB. I'M WORE OUT. Narrator: AT 23,000 FEET, THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM BARELY FUNCTIONS. Terry: WE REALLY BURN A HECK OF A LOT MORE THAN WE'RE ABLE TO PUT IN. WHEN YOU GO UP HIGH ALTITUDE, THERE'S LESS OXYGEN, AND THE BODY JUST DOESN'T WANT TO BURN FUEL THAT YOU PUT IN THROUGH YOUR MOUTH ANYMORE. I DRANK A CARBOHYDRATE DRINK, AND THEN I ATE A GEL -- CARBOHYDRATE GEL, AN ENERGY GEL. SO THERE'S ABOUT 450 CALORIES RIGHT THERE. Terry: THE BODY JUST DOES NOT WANT TO WASTE ITS ENERGY BURNING FUEL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FORCE-FEED OURSELVES, BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF OXYGEN. IT PREFERS TO CATABOLIZE, OR EAT ITSELF, UNDER TIMES OF VERY, VERY HIGH STRESS. AND IT'S A VERY, VERY STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT UP THERE, AND SO THE BODY PREFERS TO, ESSENTIALLY, EAT ITSELF. LIKE I SAID, I'M JUST GONNA EAT MOGENS. IT'S EASIER THAT WAY. AND HE'S GOT ALL THIS DIET PLAN TOGETHER, YOU KNOW, SO MANY CALORIES PER OUNCE. I'M SURE HE TAKES A DAILY VITAMIN, TOO, SO... [ LAUGHING ] Narrator: ACCLIMATIZATION HAS WORKED FOR EVERYONE BUT BRETT. HE CAN'T SLEEP AND NEEDS TO GO ON OXYGEN. I DESERVE A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, SO I'M GONNA GO ON HALF A LITER. Narrator: BUT HIGH-ALTITUDE SICKNESS AND BRAIN SWELLING ARE A 24-HOUR THREAT, AND NO ONE'S FORGOTTEN WHAT COULD HAPPEN. SPIT! OVER THE PAST SIX WEEKS, EACH CLIMBER HAS LOST BRAIN AND BODY FUNCTION, CELL BY CELL. NOW, AS THEY FALL ASLEEP, EACH MAN WONDERS IF HE'LL WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING. EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. REST, REST, REST, REST. EVER, EVER, EVER. Narrator: CAMP 1 -- 4 DAYS TO THE SUMMIT. NORTH COL, BILL, DO YOU COPY? WHEN RUSSELL BRICE RADIOS HIS GUIDE BILL AT NORTH COL, HE'S RELIEVED TO HEAR HIM CALL BACK. YEAH, RUSS, HOW ARE THINGS GOING DOWN THERE? WE'RE LOOKING COOL. LET'S JUST KEEP ROLLING. SECOND TEAM IS ON ITS WAY. Okay, thanks, man. YOU BETTER KEEP GOING BECAUSE THE OTHER GUYS ARE BEHIND YOU. TEAM 2 WILL SHORTLY LEAVE ADVANCED BASE CAMP FOR NORTH COL. BRETT, TERRY, AND MOGENS WILL DEPART FOR CAMP 2 AFTER BREAKFAST. SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE PROVEN THAT HOT TEA ACTUALLY IMPROVES THE MOOD OF MOUNTAINEERS. "WHY TEA?" IS A MYSTERY. OH, THAT'S GOOD STUFF. Narrator: BUT OXYGEN IS A KNOWN CATALYST FOR EVERY FUNCTION OF THE BODY. YEAH, I DIDN'T GO ON THE O's UNTIL MIDNIGHT AND JUST FOR ABOUT FOUR HOURS. AND, MAN -- WARMER, SLEPT DEEPER, GOT A GOOD APPETITE THIS MORNING. JUST FEEL LIKE... FEEL LIKE I'M AT SEA LEVEL RIGHT NOW. IT'S GREAT. Narrator: HOPEFULLY, THE OXYGEN WILL GIVE BRETT THE BOOST HE NEEDS, BECAUSE TODAY HE FACES A CLIMB HIGHER THAN HE'S EVER GONE BEFORE. TO REACH CAMP 2, HIS TEAM MUST TREK UP 1,500 FEET OF ICE TO AN ALTITUDE OF 24,500 FEET. MOGENS IS STOKED. BRETT SEES THE MOUNTAIN AS A GREAT EQUALIZER. Brett: I THINK IT'S GONNA GIVE ME A GREATER RESPECT FOR MYSELF, IF I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET TO THE TOP. Narrator: SOLAR RADIATION IS BRUTAL IN THIN AIR. CLIMBERS WHO BREATHE WITH THEIR JAWS OPEN CAN SUNBURN THE ROOF OF THEIR MOUTHS. EXPECTING IT TO BE VERY, VERY HOT TODAY. EXPECTING TO SWEAT A LOT, AND I'M EXPECTING TO GET DEHYDRATED BY THE TIME I GET UP THERE. I'LL PROBABLY HAVE A DEHYDRATION HEADACHE AT THE END OF THE DAY. BUT IF I DON'T, I'LL JUST BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED. Man: COULD BE VOMITING. OH, YEAH, I COULD BE VOMITING, TOO. FORGOT ABOUT THAT PART. Bill: IT SHOULD BE A GOOD TRIP TO CAMP 2. I MEAN, IT'S DEFINITELY NOT A LOT OF WIND, WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE IT'S, AS YOU CAN SEE, QUITE AN EXPOSED RIDGELINE. SOMETIMES THE HEAT, THOUGH, IS THE KILLER, LIKE YESTERDAY. AND YOU NEED TO BE IN DOWN SUITS, BECAUSE IF THE WIND CHANGES OR THE TEMPERATURE CHANGES, IT CAN GO FROM SITTING AT THE BEACH TO BEING ON THE NORTH POLE PRETTY MUCH INSTANTANEOUSLY. Narrator: THE CLIMBERS SPOT A STRING OF SHERPAS HAULING SUPPLIES TO A HIGH CAMP. BILL HOPES THE TEAM WILL MAKE THE SAME PROGRESS UP THIS SLOPE. Bill: 20, 25 FOLKS PROBABLY UP THERE IN FRONT OF US. AND IT'S NOT A LOT OF TRAFFIC, WHICH ALSO MAKES FOR A MORE EFFICIENT DAY ON THE ROPES. Narrator: USING THE ROPES FIXED DAYS AGO BY RUSSELL'S SHERPAS, THE TEAM TREKS UP A LONG, GRUELING SLOPE. MOGENS WORKS HARD TO CLEAR THE CO2 FROM HIS ASTHMATIC LUNGS. 2,000 FEET BELOW, TEAM 2 -- TIM, MAX, AND MARK -- MAKE FINAL PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR SUMMIT PUSH. EVERY STEP ON THIS MOUNTAIN IS A MIRACLE FOR MARK INGLIS. IN 1982, MARK SPENT 13 DAYS TRAPPED BY A STORM ON NEW ZEALAND'S HIGHEST PEAK -- MT. COOK. HIS FROSTBITTEN LEGS WERE AMPUTATED JUST BELOW THE KNEES. BUT HE'S NOW DETERMINED TO BE THE FIRST DOUBLE AMPUTEE TO SUMMIT EVEREST. Russell: I SEE THOSE LEGS WALK PAST THE TENT DOOR, AND I GO, "WOW, THERE'S A MARTIAN HERE." BUT, ACTUALLY, ON TOP OF THOSE LEGS IS A MAN FULL OF DETERMINATION. I ADMIRE THAT MAN. $900 BOOTS AND SOME FOOT WARMERS. FOOT WARMERS ARE ABOUT $250. WORK IT OUT TO ABOUT $25 A TOE. Narrator: TIM MEDVETZ, THE MOTORCYCLE DESIGNER FROM L.A., HAS LAGGED BEHIND THE REST OF THE TEAM SINCE DAY ONE. JUST SO EXHAUSTED. Narrator: TIM FELL ASLEEP ON A TRAINING CLIMB AND DEVELOPED BRONCHITIS SO SEVERE HE HAD TO RETREAT TO BASE CAMP TO RECOVER. BUT RUSSELL'S IMPRESSED WITH THE BIKER'S PROGRESS AND GIVES TIM THE OKAY TO GO FOR THE SUMMIT. Tim: MIGHT BE A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE REST OF THE TEAM, BUT I COULD EAT. THIS IS GONNA BE OUR SUMMIT FOOD. THIS IS JUST RICE. WE PUT SOME POWDERED MILK IN HERE, AND THEN WE PUT SOME SUGAR. AND THEN ALL WE GOT TO DO IS JUST BOIL SOME WATER UP, AND THEN WE GOT RICE PUDDING. EAT THAT UP, AND THEN WE PUSH FOR THE SUMMIT. SOME POP-TARTS, ENERGY GELS. AND THAT IS OUR FOOD STASH FOR FOUR DAYS WITH TWO PEOPLE. AND THAT'S NOT VERY MUCH. AND THERE YOU HAVE IT -- PACKING FOR THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST. Narrator: RUSSELL'S JOB NOW IS PROTECTING TIM AND THE OTHERS FROM SUDDEN ATMOSPHERIC CHANGES ON THE MOUNTAIN. HIS OBSESSION WITH WEATHER ON EVEREST BEGAN 10 YEARS AGO TO THE DAY, WITH A HORRIBLE TRAGEDY. ON MAY 10, 1996, A FREAK STORM TRAPPED A GROUP OF CLIMBERS AT THE SUMMIT. EIGHT PEOPLE DIED, INCLUDING TWO OF THE WORLD'S MOST RESPECTED MOUNTAIN GUIDES, SCOTT FISCHER AND RUSSELL'S FRIEND ROB HALL. Russell: ROB HALL COULD TALK TO HIS WIFE BACK HOME IN NEW ZEALAND, BUT HE DIED, AND HE COULDN'T EVEN TALK TO HIS SECOND GUIDE 100 METERS AWAY. [ LIGHTER CLICKING ] Narrator: MARK INGLIS LOST HIS FRIEND ANDY HARRIS THAT DAY. CAN SOMEONE GO UP TO NEMA'S CAMP AND SEE... Narrator: THE '96 TRAGEDY REVOLUTIONIZED RUSSELL'S STRATEGY ON EVEREST. RUSSELL PROTECTS HIS CLIMBERS WITH A COMMUNICATIONS MATRIX UNMATCHED ON THE MOUNTAIN. RUSSELL: Are you all together? MAN: Yeah, we're all pretty tight. Okay. UP HERE NOW, EVERY SINGLE PERSON'S GOT A RADIO -- EVERY SHERPA, EVERY MEMBER. Narrator: RUSSELL'S WEATHER REPORTS GET MORE AND MORE SOPHISTICATED. EACH SEASON, HE PAYS A SMALL FORTUNE FOR SUPERCOMPUTED FORECASTS COMPILED BY A TEAM OF SWISS METEOROLOGISTS. MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, RUSSELL STOPPED CLIMBING WITH THE TEAM UP THE MOUNTAIN. INSTEAD, HE STAYS BELOW 23,000 FEET TO KEEP HIS MIND CLEAR. FROM THESE LOWER CAMPS, HE COORDINATES THE SHERPAS LIKE A MILITARY COMMANDER. SEE YOU ALL. SEE YOU, MARK. SEE YOU, BUDDY. TAKE CARE. [ RUSSELL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON RADIO ] Narrator: RUSSELL'S GOAL IS TO WIN THE SUMMIT BATTLE WITH NO CASUALTIES. BUT IT'S TOUGH BEING PHYSICALLY SEPARATED FROM THE CLIMBERS HE'S SWORN TO PROTECT. WELL, YOU CAN'T LOOK INSIDE MY STOMACH, BUT I THINK I'M A LITTLE BIT WORRIED INSIDE -- A LITTLE BIT OF DISTRACTION HERE. BUT NOW I'M PRETTY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING UP THERE, BUT COMFORTABLE TO SEE THINGS ARE MOVING. YEAH, WE'VE GOT OLD PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD OPERATIONS. WE'VE GOT PEOPLE WITH NO LEGS. THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS GOING ON THIS YEAR, SO I THINK WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT WORRIED, I SUPPOSE. Narrator: TEAM 1 -- BRETT, MOGENS, AND TERRY -- HAVE REACHED 23,800 FEET ON THE HARD CLIMB TO CAMP 2. NICE DAY, HUH? Russell: PUT A PLASTIC BAG OVER YOUR HEAD AND RUN UP THE STAIRS. THAT'S PROBABLY HOW YOU FEEL. IT'S NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD FEELING, SHORTAGE OF BREATH. IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF FRUSTRATION AS WELL. PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY'RE FIT AND STRONG, BUT THEY CAN'T MOVE AS WELL AS THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN MOVE AT SEA LEVEL. IT'S HARD TO PREDICT HOW YOU'RE GONNA DO ABOVE 8,000 IF THE CONDITIONS ARE PRETTY POOR. BUT SO FAR, THE FORECAST LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. YOU KNOW, I GO UP THERE WITH A BIT OF TREPIDATION, TOO, JUST AS ANYBODY ELSE WHO'S GETTING ABOVE 8,000 METERS FOR THE FIRST TIME. I'VE GOT JUST AS MANY CONCERNS, YOU KNOW? Narrator: LAST YEAR, BRETT MORTGAGED HIS HOUSE TO PAY FOR HIS CLIMB. THIS YEAR, A FRIEND PUT UP THE $40,000 FEE, SO NOW THE PRESSURE ON BRETT TO SUMMIT IS EVEN HIGHER. Brett: I DON'T CARE IF I'M THE LAST ONE UP THERE. I DON'T CARE IF I'M THE LAST ONE DOWN. JUST AS LONG AS I MAKE IT. Narrator: BRETT'S NOW FALLEN WAY BEHIND MOGENS AND TERRY, WHEN THE WIND SUDDENLY PICKS UP. EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER. REST, REST, REST, REST. EVER, EVER, EVER. WHEN UNBROKEN SNOW FALLS FROM AN OVERCAST SKY ONTO SNOW-COVERED GROUND, IT'S CALLED A WHITEOUT. CAUGHT IN THE FREEZING WHITE GLOW, THERE ARE NO SHADOWS AND NO OTHER CLIMBERS. BRETT LOSES ALL SENSE OF DEPTH AND ORIENTATION. BRETT'S GROUND TO A HALT, PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY STUNNED BY THE STORM. AND NOW HIS RADIO FALLS SILENT. TERRY, MOGENS, AND BRETT ARE SWALLOWED BY A WHITEOUT AND LASHED WITH 50-MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS. DOWN AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP, EXPEDITION LEADER, RUSSELL BRICE, KNOWS THE MEN HAVE BEEN CLIMBING FOR FIVE HOURS AND HOPES THEY'RE CLOSE TO CAMP 2. WHAT HE DOESN'T KNOW IS MOGENS AND TERRY HAVE COMPLETELY LOST SIGHT OF BRETT, AND THE FIREMAN HAS BEEN OUT OF RADIO CONTACT FOR HOURS. SO, WHAT'S HAPPENING, BRETT? [ RADIO STATIC ] Narrator: AS THE WEATHER BEGINS TO CLEAR, HE CAN SEE CAMP 2 LESS THAN 500 FEET AWAY. BUT BRETT IS PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTED AND THINKS HE'S SUFFERING AN ATTACK OF ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS. YEAH, OKAY. UNDERSTAND. SORRY TO HEAR THAT, BRETT. But, as you know, I can't get in your head. BUT IF YOU FEEL AS THOUGH IT'S YOUR BEST SHOT, THEN THAT'S UP TO YOU, MAN. OKAY, BRO. THANK YOU. WELL, I RECKON BRETT'S COMING DOWN TOMORROW. DOESN'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO COME DOWN HERE, BUT HE MAYBE JUST WANTS TO LICK HIS WOUNDS FOR A LITTLE WHILE. THAT'S FAIR. THAT'S OKAY. BUMMER. [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: BRETT'S NEAREST SAFE HAVEN IS CAMP 1 AT NORTH COL, 1,000 FEET BELOW. WHEN HE GETS THERE, HE'LL MEET MARK, TIM, AND MAX FROM TEAM 2, WHO'VE ARRIVED FROM ADVANCED BASE CAMP. Brett: YEAH, THANKS, PAL. I COULDN'T PUT ANOTHER FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER. WHEN I TOOK OFF THIS MORNING, I JUST SAW MYSELF ON THE SUMMIT. I FELT LIKE A MILLION BUCKS. HELL, I WENT CLIMBING WITH MOGENS. "LET'S GO, YOU AND ME, WE'LL CLIMB TOGETHER." AND... I GOT ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF BELOW CAMP 2 AND JUST COMPLETELY BONKED -- NOTHING LEFT. EVERY LITTLE MOTION WAS LIKE -- I WAS JUST SO SPENT. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, ALL THOSE GUYS GOT UP THERE WITHOUT OXYGEN. I WAS ON TWO LITERS. YOU KNOW, LET'S BE REALISTIC. IF I CAN'T MAKE IT UP THE HILL ON TWO LITERS OF OXYGEN, WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME UP HIGHER UP? THEN I JUST BECOME A LIABILITY. I CAN MAKE EXCUSES TILL THE COWS COME HOME. BUT... I THINK IN MY HEART OF HEART, I THINK... I THINK IT MAY BE JUST TOO TOUGH FOR ME. I'M A WIENIE. NO, NO. WIENIE FOR THE DAY. I WOULDN'T SAY YOU'RE A WIENIE. NO, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT. Narrator: WORRIED ABOUT THE TRAIL AHEAD, THE TEAM PUMPS BRETT FOR INFORMATION. Max: IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A BIT MORE WINDY TOMORROW. WAS THE WIND BEARABLE TODAY, BRETT? AND THEN SOON AS THAT WIND COMES UP, SOON AS YOU GET OVER THAT FIRST RISE, FORGET IT. THEN IT STARTS GETTING COOL. DOES IT? YEAH. AND THEN THE SNOWSTORM CAME IN, AND THEN THE WHITEOUT. IT'S A COLD AND LONELY PLACE UP THERE. Narrator: BETS WERE ON BRETT TO SUMMIT THIS YEAR, BUT NO ONE PUT ANY MONEY ON TIM. BIG BOSS MAN PUT A LITTLE PRESSURE ON ME BEFORE I LEFT. HE'S GOT ME ON A TIME SCHEDULE. TIM HAS CONSISTENTLY FALLEN BEHIND HIS FELLOW CLIMBERS AND REMAINS A QUESTION MARK. HOW WE DOING ON THAT SOUP OVER THERE, BOBBY? Bobby: KEEP CALM. SHARE. BE KIND. AND DON'T SING. * HEY, THERE, LONELY GIRL * [ LAUGHING ] CAMPING WITH THE BOYS... 23,000 FEET. IT KILLS YOU, THIS ALTITUDE, DOESN'T IT? BANG! UP HERE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS, AND YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP. WHEN THE REST OF TEAM 1 -- MOGENS AND TERRY -- REACH CAMP 2, THEY FIND OUT THAT BRETT'S TURNED BACK. Bill: NEVER LIKE TO HAVE PEOPLE TURN AROUND, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE DOING QUITE WELL. Narrator: BRETT'S TURNAROUND IS ANOTHER OMEN ADDED TO THE DEATH OF THE SHERPA, THE NEAR-DEATH OF THE INDIAN CLIMBER, AND A WHITEOUT RUSSELL NEVER SAW COMING. ARE THE WINDS STRONGER FIRST THING IN THE MORNING? SHOULD WE WAIT A BIT? THOUGHT IT WAS COMING IN TOMORROW NIGHT. THEN, NEAR THE END OF THE DAY, EVEREST KILLS AGAIN. BILL RADIOS IN THE NEWS. SOME CZECH CLIMBERS HAD AN ACCIDENT IN LHOTSE COULOIR TODAY. YEAH, ONE SERIOUS. FATAL. [ RADIO STATIC ] EVEREST BECOMES THE TOMBSTONE FOR ANOTHER MOUNTAINEER. A 38-YEAR-OLD CZECH CLIMBER DIED FROM A FALL ON THE MOUNTAIN'S SOUTH SIDE. FIVE LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST SINCE THE EXPEDITION BEGAN, AND SOON MOGENS AND TERRY WILL ENTER THE DEATH ZONE. CAMP 1 AT NORTH COL AT 23,000 FEET -- BY MAY 11th, FATALITIES ARE STACKING UP ON THE MOUNTAIN. FOUR SHERPAS AND ONE CLIMBER HAVE DIED SINCE THE START OF THE CLIMBING SEASON. Brett: ABC, ABC -- NORTH COL. HEY, RUSS, WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW I'M HEADING DOWN FROM THE NORTH COL TO ABC. OKAY, PAL. OKAY, PAL. SEE YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE. Narrator: AS BRETT HEADS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN, MOGENS AND TERRY DEPART FOR CAMP 3 AT 25,900 FEET. IN THE MEANTIME, MARK, TIM, AND MAX LEAVE NORTH COL FOR CAMP 2. ON TEAM 2, NO ONE FACES A GREATER CHALLENGE THAN DOUBLE AMPUTEE MARK INGLIS. THE CLIMB TO CAMP 2 ADDS 5 MORE HOURS OF STRESS ON HIS CARBON FIBER LEGS, BUT MARK'S SUPPLY OF GUTS IS ENDLESS. AS MARK INCHES UP TO CAMP 2... BRETT AND A SHERPA ESCORT REACH THE OUTSKIRTS OF ADVANCED BASE CAMP. Brett: MY JOURNEY'S OVER WITH FOR RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW? IT'S ON TO ANOTHER BIG ADVENTURE IN MY LIFE. RIVER RAFTING TRIPS THROUGH THE GRAND CANYON, SCUBA DIVING IN THAILAND -- YOU KNOW, STUFF BELOW 25,000 FEET [LAUGHS] WHICH PRETTY MUCH IS JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING, EXCEPT FOR MT. EVEREST. PUT ME ON THE FIRST YAK BACK TO KATHMANDU. HOW ARE YOU? I LOVED IT. REALLY? I JUST COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE. AIN'T CUT OUT FOR IT, PAL. I GAVE IT A TRY, MAN. YOU BETTER GO BACK AND PUT FIRES OUT. I'LL HAVE TO COME OVER AND SEE IF YOU CAN TEACH ME TO SLIDE DOWN THE POLE, HUH? OH, I'M SURE YOU'LL DO FINE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, MAN -- I GAVE IT 98%. I DIDN'T GIVE IT 75%. I GAVE IT 98%. 2% GOT ME BACK. GOOD THING IT WAS DOWNHILL. IT'S NICE TO HAVE AN APPETITE BACK. GOOD. Narrator: HIGH ABOVE ABC, BRETT'S TEAMMATES -- MOGENS AND TERRY -- WILL SOON LEAVE CAMP 2 FOR CAMP 3. MAN: And got about 12 hours. Narrator: BEFORE DEPARTURE, THEY WENT ON BOTTLED O2, BECAUSE HERE AT 24,500 FEET, THE OXYGEN IN THE AIR IS JUST 43% OF THAT AT SEA LEVEL. HEY, MOGENS, CHECK YOUR HARNESS FOR ME. MOGENS REMAINS OFF BOTTLED OXYGEN, DETERMINED TO REACH THE SUMMIT ON HIS OWN POWER. MOGENS IS THE FIRST TO LEAVE FOR CAMP 3. HE'S TRYING WITHOUT OXYGEN. THAT'S HIS PERSONAL GOAL. AND, YOU KNOW, I REALLY ADMIRE THIS YOUNG BOY. GOOD FOR HIM. AND HE'S CAPABLE OF DOING THAT. OTHERWISE, I WOULDN'T HAVE HIM HERE. HE'S A VERY STRONG INDIVIDUAL, OBVIOUSLY -- VERY FIT. AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S GONNA HAVE COLDER FINGERS AND TOES THAN US, AND HE'LL BE BREATHING THE AMBIENT AIR. AND THE COLDER IT IS, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT WILL BE FOR HIM. Narrator: BACK AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP, BRETT MOURNS THE DEATH OF HIS DREAM. Brett: I WAS ENVISIONING MYSELF ON MT. EVEREST. THAT'S HOW CONFIDENT I FELT. I WAS PROUD OF MYSELF, YOU KNOW? [ Voice breaking ] I, UH... I SET THE GOAL, AND I MADE IT. BUT... THERE WAS A STRONG SENSE OF CALM THAT CAME OVER ME. BECAUSE UNTIL YOU GO UP THERE AND YOU TRY SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU CAN'T EVEN PUT INTO WORDS HOW TOUGH IT IS. WHEN YOU'RE UP THAT HIGH AND YOUR BODY JUST GIVES OUT... I JUST KNEW THE TRIP WAS OVER WITH. I HAD REACHED MY SUMMIT. Narrator: RUSSELL'S TEAMS ARE HIGH ON THE MOUNTAIN AND ON THEIR OWN. IT'S HARD UP THERE. WE'RE SITTING DOWN HERE IN THE SUN NOW TALKING ABOUT IT, BUT UP THERE, IT'S BRUTAL. THEY'VE GOT TO DO IT. THEY'VE GOT TO PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER. HOW THEY PLAY THEIR GAME IS UP TO THEM. Narrator: AFTER A FIVE-HOUR TREK, MARK INGLIS AND TEAM 2 MAKE IT TO CAMP 2. IT'S 25 DEGREES BELOW ZERO, BUT SPIRITS ARE HIGH. 1,400 FEET ABOVE, TERRY AND MOGENS ARRIVE AT CAMP 3. CAMP 3 IS DELIBERATELY LOCATED JUST BELOW THE DEATH ZONE... A FROZEN DESERT WHERE NO LIFE SURVIVES, AND HUMANS VISIT AT TREMENDOUS RISK. BY REACHING CAMP 3, MOGENS HAS PUSHED HIS BODY FIVE MILES ABOVE SEA LEVEL WITHOUT OXYGEN. Mogens: IT'S AMAZING. WHEW! Bill: THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE, TERRY. ACTUALLY, THE HARDEST PART OF MY WHOLE TRIP IS BLOWING UP MY THERM-A-REST RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHS ] YEAH, THAT'S HARD. Narrator: FOR MOGENS, RUSSELL'S DECISION TO SUMMIT EARLY SEEMS LIKE A GOOD MOVE, AND HE'S FEELING STRONG. THE WINDS HERE CAN RAKE THE CAMP WITH 100-MILE-AN-HOUR BLASTS, EQUAL TO A CATEGORY TWO HURRICANE. UNLESS THE TENTS ARE ANCHORED WITH ROCKS, THEY'LL BE BLOWN AWAY. IT LOOKS LIKE GETTING GOOD FOR SATURDAY/SUNDAY. LATEST FORECAST IS PRETTY GOOD FOR THAT. YEAH, WE'RE ALL DOING WELL. NOT TOO BAD OF WINDS. I DON'T KNOW -- 20, 50, MAYBE, GUSTING. Narrator: IF RUSSELL FAILS TO ANTICIPATE RADICAL SHIFTS IN THE WEATHER, FROM HERE ON, SOMEONE WILL DIE. DOWN AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP, BRETT STRUGGLES TO COME TO GRIPS. Brett: NO, I CAN'T DO IT, AND I DON'T WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE. I'M SECURE WITH THAT... WITH MY POSITION ON THAT NOW. YOU KNOW, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHO'S MORE OF A MAN, WHO'S MORE PHYSICALLY FIT, WHO'S MORE MENTALLY TOUGH. THERE'S A LOT OF THOSE ATTRIBUTES THAT COME INTO IT. AND THEY'RE A HUGE PART. DON'T LET ME DISCOUNT IT. BUT THE GENETIC ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO IT IS A BASELINE FACTOR. AND I DON'T HAVE IT, AND I ACCEPT THAT. Narrator: BRETT WAS SIMPLY NOT BORN WITH THE GENES TO ACCLIMATIZE ON EVEREST. NOW, BY ACCEPTING HIS PHYSICAL LIMITS, HE'S GAINED A NEW PERSPECTIVE. Brett: I REACHED MY SUMMIT. I SUMMITED UP THERE, EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T GET TO THE TOP. I REACHED THE TOP OF MY OWN MOUNTAIN, PHILOSOPHICALLY. SO I'M DONE. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PRETTY NICE SUNSET TONIGHT. YEAH, IT LOOKS GOOD. YEAH. WOW. IT'S GONNA BE BEAUTIFUL. Narrator: NEXT TIME -- WITH THE SUMMIT IN SIGHT, THE MOUNTAIN TURNS ON MOGENS, AND TEAM 1 IS HELD HOSTAGE BY SUB-ZERO WINDS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE STUCK HERE ANOTHER DAY. BUGGER! Narrator: EXPEDITION LEADER RUSSELL BRICE MUST DECIDE WHETHER TO DELAY THE CLIMB OR SEND HIS TEAMS INTO THE DEATH ZONE. CAN YOU TURN THAT TO FOUR -- OXYGEN? Narrator: AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT WAITING AT SUMMIT HEAVEN... Russell: Please tell them, let us pass, over. Narrator: ...IS A TRAFFIC JAM FROM HELL. THIS IS A PLACE WAITING FOR A BIG ACCIDENT. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE.
