 >> Narrator: HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS, SUB-ZERO TEMPERATURES, MINIMAL OXYGEN. IT'S NO WONDER EVEREST HAS CLAIMED THE LIVES OF OVER 200 PEOPLE. >> IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO SURVIVE THIS LONG, I SUPPOSE. >> Narrator: YET THE DETERMINATION OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT HAS DRIVEN A TEAM OF

 AMATEUR CLIMBERS TO CHALLENGE THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN ON EARTH. >> THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. TREAT IT AS DANGEROUS. >> Narrator: BUT THE TEAM'S A LONG WAY FROM CONVINCING EXPEDITION LEADER RUSSELL BRICE THEY'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES. BIKER TIM MEDVETZ IS DANGEROUSLY ARROGANT. >> OH, EASY, PIECE OF CAKE. >> Narrator: AND NOVICE BETSY HUELSKAMP HAS BEEN HIT BY

 THE ALTITUDE. >> GOD, I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA THROW UP. >> Narrator: HIGH ON THE MOUNTAIN, TWO CLIMBERS ARE MISSING. A SEARCH PARTY'S ON ITS WAY, BUT WILL THEY FIND THEM IN TIME? >> COME TO EVEREST -- THE STRONG SURVIVE. THE WEAK WILL GET EATEN. >> Narrator: DAWN AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP -- THE START OF THE MOST FRIGHTENING DAY YET FOR RUSSELL BRICE'S TEAM. THE TWO CLIMBERS ARE STILL MISSING. IT'S AN UNNERVING WAKE-UP CALL FOR TEAM MEMBERS LIKE BUSINESSMAN DAVID TAIT. >> I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED FOR THE KAZAK CLIMBERS BECAUSE THEY'RE WITHOUT OXYGEN, AND IF THEY ARE UP THERE WITHOUT OXYGEN, AS THE RUMORS GO -- THE BLOOD THICKENING, THE TIME, THE CLOCK AGAINST YOU IS FAR MORE DANGEROUS THAN GOING WITH OXYGEN. >> 10 HOURS, MINIMUM. >> IT REMINDS ME THAT THESE GUYS WERE PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE. >> Narrator: IF TWO HIGHLY EXPERIENCED CLIMBERS MIGHT ALREADY BE DEAD, WHAT HOPE FOR A BUNCH OF AMATEURS? >> PERFECT. >> Narrator: TODAY IS THEIR FIRST BIG TEST -- THE NORTH COL. THEY FACE AN EXHAUSTING GRIND UP A 1,000-FOOT ICE CLIFF... THEN A MISERABLE NIGHT TRYING TO SLEEP AT 23,000 FEET. IF THEY FAIL TO MAKE IT WITHIN FIVE HOURS, THEY'RE OFF THE TEAM AND ON THEIR WAY HOME. >> [ COUGHS ] OW. >> Narrator: BIKER TIM IS GOING NOWHERE. >> I WOKE UP IN THE MORNING AND KIND OF HAD A STIFF BACK, AND THEN I BENT OVER TO ADJUST MY BOOT OR SOMETHING, AND I HEARD SOMETHING KIND OF CRACK. NOTHING'S WORKING. OHH! IT'S JUST MY BACK. SOMETIMES IT JUST TIGHTENS UP, ALL THE MUSCLES AROUND IT, AROUND MY CAGE. >> Narrator: HIS BODY'S FULL OF METAL AFTER A NEAR-FATAL MOTORCYCLE CRASH. AND HIS SPINE IS SURROUNDED BY A WIRE CAGE. >> IS IT MUSCLE PAIN THAT YOU GET? >> IT TIGHTENS UP. MY BACK TIGHTENS UP. >> Narrator: THERE'S NOT MUCH EXPEDITION DOCTOR MONICA PIRIS CAN DO AT 21,000 FEET OTHER THAN FIT TIM WITH A PAINKILLER PATCH. >> I SLEEP ON THEM ROCKS. >> YEAH. >> Narrator: BUT HE'S NO QUITTER. >> AIN'T NO SHERPA GONNA CARRY ME UP, AND AIN'T NO SHERPA GONNA CARRY ME DOWN, PERIOD. >> Narrator: TODAY'S CLIMB TO THE NORTH COL IS A TIME TRIAL, BUT IT'S ALSO VITAL ACCLIMATION TRAINING. EVERY TIME THE TEAM CLIMBS HIGHER, THEIR BODIES ARE SHOCKED INTO PRODUCING MORE RED BLOOD CELLS. THE MORE RED BLOOD CELLS YOU HAVE, THE MORE OXYGEN YOUR LUNGS CAN ABSORB. AND UP HERE, EVERY OXYGEN MOLECULE IS PRECIOUS. >> [ Coughing ] GOT TO WAKE UP. AAH! >> Narrator: MONICA PIRIS IS A SPECIALIST IN HIGH-ALTITUDE MEDICINE. SO SHE KNOWS THE DANGERS OF GOING FURTHER WITHOUT ACCLIMATING PROPERLY. >> YOU'D INITIALLY FEEL SHORT OF BREATH, AND THEN YOUR BRAIN WOULD START TO SWELL. YOUR LUNGS WOULD PROBABLY START TO FILL WITH FLUID. YOU'D LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS, AND YOU'D DIE. >> JUST WALKING BACK FROM THE TOILET MAKES YOU REALLY TIRED. SO IMAGINE HOW TIRED IF YOU'RE WALKING UP THERE. EVEN THOUGH IT'S REALLY FAR AND IT'S REALLY TIRING, I'M MORE SCARED ABOUT THE COLD. >> Narrator: CALIFORNIA JOURNALIST BETSY HUELSKAMP BEGGED RUSSELL FOR A PLACE ON HIS EXPEDITION AFTER INTERVIEWING BIKER TIM LAST YEAR. >> AS FAR AS PHYSICAL QUESTS IN OUR WORLD GO, IT'S TAKING ON SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY MONUMENTOUS, ESPECIALLY FOR SOME SKINNY LITTLE GIRL FROM LOS ANGELES. >> Narrator: BUT NOVICE BETSY HAS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP WITH THE OTHERS, AND RUSSELL'S GUIDES ARE WATCHING LIKE HAWKS. >> I THINK SHE IS QUITE UNDERPREPARED BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT SHE WAS GETTING HERSELF IN FOR. YOU'VE GOT TO BASICALLY BE ABLE TO GET TO THE NORTH COL IN FIVE HOURS. IF YOU CAN'T, THEN YOU'RE NOT ON THE SUMMIT TEAM. >> Narrator: RUSSELL IS STUNNED TO FIND OUT BETSY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ATTACH CRAMPONS, THE SPIKES USED TO CLIMB ON SNOW AND ICE. >> I'VE SEEN PEOPLE PUT THEIR CRAMPONS ON UPSIDE DOWN BEFORE, BUT NOT UPSIDE DOWN AND BACKWARDS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] >> MAYBE WE'LL REGRET IT, AND MAYBE WE WON'T. >> SHE NEEDS A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE. HER FOOTWORK WITH CRAMPONS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH, EVEN ON JUST SNOW AND ICE THAT SHE'S WORKED ON SO FAR. IT'S BEEN SATISFACTORY ONLY. AND ONCE YOU START GOING INTO MIXED TERRAIN, IT DOESN'T WORK. >> * JOY TO THE WORLD * ALL >> WE'RE NOT THE SAME, AMERICANS AND ENGLISH PEOPLE, ARE WE? THERE'S THIS BIG PIECE OF OCEAN BETWEEN US. HAVE YOU LOST IT? >> [ LAUGHS ] >> [ CHUCKLES ] >> I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF HERE. >> Narrator: ROD BABER FIRST DECIDED TO CLIMB EVEREST DURING A DRINKING SESSION WITH HIS BUDDIES. BUT NO HANGOVER CAN COMPARE WITH THE POUNDING HEADACHES HE'S SUFFERED ON EVEREST. >> I'VE HAD A FEW HANGOVERS BEFORE, BUT NOW I CAN MIX DRINKS AND DRINK AS MUCH AS I LIKE FOR AS LONG AS I LIKE AND WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY, AND IF I HAVE A LITTLE HEADACHE, I GO, "OH! OH, THAT'S NOTHING." >> Narrator: ROD'S STRUGGLING TO DEAL WITH THE HARDSHIPS OF EVERYDAY LIFE AT ABC. LAST NIGHT IT WAS MINUS 3 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. >> THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR DRINKING WATER WHEN IT'S INSIDE YOUR JACKET, INSIDE YOUR SLEEPING BAG, AT NIGHT. >> Narrator: BUT FROZEN WATER BOTTLES ARE NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE DEVASTATING COLD THEY'LL FACE HIGHER UP THE MOUNTAIN. [ WIND HOWLING ] LAST YEAR FRENCHMAN GéRARD BOURRAT TOOK HIS GLOVES OFF TO TAKE PHOTOS... AND LOST ALL HIS FINGERS TO FROSTBITE. THE TEAM IS READY TO START THEIR FIRST SERIOUS CLIMB, AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING. THEY HAVE THE NEXT FIVE HOURS TO REACH THE TOP OF THE NORTH COL AND PROVE TO RUSSELL THEY HAVE THE STRENGTH AND SKILL TO CLIMB THE WORLD'S HIGHEST MOUNTAIN. >> [ SIGHS ] >> Narrator: BIKER TIM HAS CONVINCED THE DOCTOR HE'S GOOD TO GO. >> I WANT TO MAKE SURE I MAKE THAT DEADLINE. THEY JUST CAN'T WAIT TO KICK ME OFF THE TEAM. AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN, THOUGH. >> Narrator: EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS GOT IT ALL TO PROVE. IT'S 10:00 IN THE MORNING. THE SHERPA RESCUE TEAM ARE FIGHTING THEIR WAY UP THE MOUNTAIN AS FAST AS THEY CAN TO REACH THE MISSING CLIMBERS. THE MEN ARE FROM KAZAKHSTAN AND MADE FRIENDS WITH ANOTHER EXPEDITION BEFORE THEY LEFT FOR THE SUMMIT. >> [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] COPY ME? OVER. >> THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THEM BY YESTERDAY EVENING. IT CERTAINLY ENTERED MY MIND THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING AMISS. >> KAZAKHSTANS. THIS IS MAXUT. HE'S 30 OR 31. AND THIS HERE IS VASSILY. >> THE TWO OF THEM HAVE CLIMBED TOGETHER FOR MANY YEARS, SO THEY KNOW EACH OTHER WELL. [ STATIC CRACKLING ] >> LAST YEAR, I THINK IT WAS, THEY SPENT FOUR NIGHTS STRANDED ON K2 AND GOT OUT OF THAT SUCCESSFULLY. >> THEY NEED TO RADIO FOR HELP. THEY'RE DEFINITELY IN A BAD POSITION. I MEAN, THEY'RE NO DRAMA QUEENS. >> Narrator: AFTER HOURS OF SILENCE, THE RADIO FINALLY CRACKLES TO LIFE. [ INDISTINCT SPEAKING OVER RADIO ] >> THIS IS RONNY IN ABC. DO YOU COPY? [ INDISTINCT SPEAKING OVER RADIO ] >> Narrator: THIS IS THE FIRST NEWS OF THE MISSING MEN. >> [ INDISTINCT SPEAKING OVER RADIO ] >> THAT'S MAX. >> THAT'S MAX. >> THAT'S MAXUT. >> YEAH. >> Narrator: THE MISSING CLIMBERS ARE ALIVE, BUT THEY'RE REFUSING HELP. [ INDISTINCT SPEAKING OVER RADIO ] >> HE DOESN'T WANT TO USE THE OXYGEN. >> HE DOESN'T WANT TO USE IT? >> YEAH. >> ...CLIMBED 1,600 METERS TODAY ALONE CARRYING OXYGEN. >> AND NOW THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT. >> THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT. >> Narrator: THE KAZAKS KNOW THEIR ACHIEVEMENT OF SUMMITING WITHOUT OXYGEN WON'T BE RECOGNIZED UNLESS THEY MAKE IT BACK TO ADVANCED BASE CAMP WITHOUT USING IT. [ INDISTINCT SPEAKING OVER RADIO ] >> WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS UNFAIR BECAUSE THERE'S A BUNCH OF SHERPAS UP THERE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT STAKE, AND THEY'RE NOT PLAYING BALL. >> Narrator: THE KAZAKS' DETERMINATION GOT THEM TO THE SUMMIT, BUT NOW IT'S THREATENING TO BE THE DEATH OF THEM AND THEIR RESCUERS. >> Narrator: RUSSELL BRICE'S TEAM ARE AT 21,750 FEET AND HEADING FOR THE MASSIVE CLIFF OF THE NORTH COL. AS THEY CROSS THE EAST RONGBUK GLACIER, EVERY STEP HURTS MORE THAN THE LAST. THEIR HEARTS ARE RACING OUT OF CONTROL. THEY'RE GETTING SEVERELY DEHYDRATED, AND THEY'RE GASPING FOR BREATH AS THE AIR GETS THINNER AND THINNER. >> I NEED SOME PILLS. I NEED TO GET SOME PILLS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ROPE. >> Narrator: ROD HASN'T EVEN REACHED THE CLIMBING ROPES WHEN HE'S HIT BY A SEARING HEADACHE, A SIGN THAT SOMETHING COULD BE SERIOUSLY WRONG. AT THIS ALTITUDE, A HEADACHE COULD BE CEREBRAL EDEMA, A HIGH-ALTITUDE CLIMBER'S GREATEST FEAR. IT STRIKES SUDDENLY, AND VICTIMS CAN BE DEAD IN MINUTES. LIKE ROD, THIS CLIMBER WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE NORTH COL. >> COME ON. CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN. >> CEREBRAL EDEMA IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CONDITIONS, IF NOT THE MOST DANGEROUS CONDITION, RELATED TO BEING AT HIGH ALTITUDE. >> Narrator: THIS MAN WAS LUCKY TO SURVIVE. MANY OTHERS DON'T. >> CEREBRAL EDEMA IS SWELLING OF THE BRAIN. IT HAPPENS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE DECREASED OXYGEN THAT THERE IS IN THE AIR. YOU HAVE SEVERE BRAIN SWELLING. YOU'RE IN A COMA, APPROACHING DEATH. >> [ INDISTINCT SPEAKING ] [ COUGHS ] >> Narrator: ROD'S ANXIETY IS MAKING THE SITUATION EVEN WORSE. SCIENTISTS HAVE PROVED THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE STRESSED ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO DOWN WITH ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS. >> IF IT DOESN'T GO, THEN I HAVEN'T GOT A CHOICE. I WON'T BE -- I WON'T BE -- I WON'T BE ALLOWED TO CLIMB. >> Narrator: FROM HIGH UP THE MOUNTAIN, THE SHERPA RESCUE TEAM RADIO THAT THE KAZAK CLIMBERS ARE IN A BAD WAY. >> AND IS IT ONE OF THEM OR BOTH OF THEM? >> I DON'T KNOW. >> DON'T KNOW. >> I MUST BE HONEST. IT'S BLOODY SCARY, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, EVEN WITH HELP NOW, IF YOU'VE GOT FROSTBITE, AND THIS WEATHER'S COMING IN... PHEW. AND THE THING IS... I MEAN, HOW MUCH DAYLIGHT HAVE WE GOT LEFT? WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT ABOUT SIX HOURS OF TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE PRETTY IMMOBILE GET DOWN. AND THAT'S PUSHING IT. >> [ CLEARS THROAT ] I'D TALK A LOT MORE IF THE HEADACHE WASN'T HERE. >> Narrator: ROD'S HEADACHE IS GETTING WORSE, AND HE'S NOW GAMBLING WITH HIS LIFE. AS THE TEAM GET THEIR FIRST LOOK AT THE NORTH COL, THEY'RE HIT BY THE MASSIVE TASK AHEAD. A 1,000-FOOT ICE CLIFF AWAITS -- HARD ENOUGH TO CLIMB AT SEA LEVEL, AT FOUR MILES UP, AGONIZING. >> EACH STEP, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO DIE. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE THAT CLOSE TO NOT HAVING ENOUGH AIR, PASSING OUT, AND FALLING DOWN WHERE YOU STAND. >> Narrator: BACK HOME, BETSY'S A FIT WOMAN, A KARATE BLACK BELT AND FITNESS INSTRUCTOR. BUT FITNESS HAS NO BEARING ON WHO CAN ACCLIMATE. >> I FEEL SO TIRED. IT'S JUST LACK OF OXYGEN IN THE AIR THAT MAKES YOU THINK, "HOLY CRAP, I CAN'T GO. I CAN'T DO THIS." >> Narrator: BUT DO THIS BETSY MUST, OR RUSSELL WILL THROW HER OFF THE TEAM. 22,300 FEET, AND ONE MOUNTAIN IS TAKING ON ANOTHER. BIKER MEDVETZ IS ON THE ROPES. >> OHH. I COULD USE A NEW BACK. OTHER THAN THAT, I FEEL GREAT. >> I'M GOING SLOWLY, BUT, YOU KNOW -- SLOWLY BUT SURELY. >> Narrator: THE FASTEST CLIMBERS ARE 45-YEAR-OLD ENGLISHMAN DAVID TAIT AND DANISH TRIATHLETE MOGENS JENSEN, WHO IS ON TARGET TO CUT THE FIVE-HOUR DEADLINE IN HALF. >> IT'S NICE. BUT, YEAH, JUST DOING A STEADY PACE, NOTHING CRAZY, CONSERVING ENERGY. >> Narrator: LOWER DOWN THE ROPES, BETSY IS HITTING THE WALL. >> I'M GOING TO LET PEOPLE PASS. >> Narrator: IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE A NICE, SUNNY DAY, BUT IMAGINE HAVING HALF AS MUCH AIR AS YOU DO BACK HOME, A POUNDING HEAD, AND FEELING UTTERLY EXHAUSTED. WELCOME TO BETSY'S WORLD. >> I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA THROW UP. >> Narrator: WHILE SHE SUFFERS, MOGENS CRUISES OVER THE FINISHING LINE, JUST 2 1/2 HOURS AFTER LEAVING ADVANCED BASE CAMP 2,000 FEET BELOW. HALFWAY UP THE ICE CLIFF, ROD BABER IS STRUGGLING. >> [ Breathing hard ] PRETTY HARD. WHAT TIME... [ COUGHS ] 10 MINUTES. FIRST TIME. [ BREATHES HEAVILY ] >> Narrator: HE'S HIGHER THAN HE'S EVER CLIMBED BEFORE, AND HIS BODY IS SCREAMING OUT TO STOP. IF HE CAN'T KEEP GOING, HIS DREAM OF CLIMBING EVEREST WILL END BEFORE IT'S BEGUN. >> Narrator: AMATEUR CLIMBER ROD BABER GOT INTO MOUNTAINEERING THROUGH A BET WITH HIS DRINKING BUDDIES. >> [ COUGHS ] >> Narrator: BUT NOW HE'S IN BIG TROUBLE HALFWAY UP MT. EVEREST, ON THE NORTH COL, AND THERE'S ONLY 50 MINUTES LEFT BEFORE THE 5-HOUR DEADLINE EXPIRES. >> [ COUGHS ] 10 MINUTES. FIRST TIMES. [ BREATHES HEAVILY ] >> Narrator: ROD HAS A YOUNG FAMILY AND KNOWS HE SHOULD BE TURNING BACK AS HIS HEADACHE GETS WORSE AND EVERY STEP INCREASES THE RISK OF CEREBRAL EDEMA. >> I'VE GOT TWO KIDS -- FLASH AND JAUNTY. I'LL CERTAINLY BE CONSIDERING THEM EVERY SINGLE MOVE I MAKE UPWARDS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME. >> Narrator: ROD IS A CLIMBING INSTRUCTOR BACK HOME, BUT THAT'S NOTHING TO RUSSELL BRICE. >> I'M NOT EVEN SURE HE'S ACTUALLY FIT ENOUGH, FRANKLY. SURE, HE RUNS A CLIMBING GYM, BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY MOUNTAIN WINGS. >> Narrator: BUT SHEER GRIT COUNTS FOR A LOT ON EVEREST. BIG TIM MEDVETZ HAS PUSHED ON AND IS NOT FAR FROM THE END OF THIS MONUMENTAL CLIMB. >> I'M DOING GREAT, JUST HUNGRY, HUNGRY AND BACK PAIN. BUT I GOT MY MUSIC ON. TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT. >> Narrator: AFTER 4 1/2 PUNISHING HOURS, TIM MAKES IT -- A STAGGERING SUCCESS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR, WHEN HE HAD A MOTIVATION CRISIS AND WAS TOO TIRED TO CARRY ON. AND DESPITE HIS PAIN, ROD BABER HAS MADE IT JUST INSIDE THE FIVE-HOUR DEADLINE. >> IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING PRETTY. [ COUGHS ] IT'S ABOUT GETTING TO THE [ BLEEP ] TOP. [ COUGHS ] >> Narrator: BUT ROD'S SO EXHAUSTED HE COLLAPSES INTO HIS TENT RIGHT AWAY. >> EACH TIME YOU GET TO THE TOP OF THE ROPE AND YOU GET TO SWITCH ROPES, IT'S LIKE SOME KIND OF A LITTLE VICTORY IN YOUR HEAD. >> Narrator: THAT MAY BE SO, BUT TIME'S UP. AND RUSSELL'S HAWKS ARE CIRCLING. GUIDE DEAN STAPLES HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON BETSY. THE FIVE-HOUR DEADLINE HAS PASSED, AND SHE'S NOWHERE NEAR THE TOP. >> SO, HOW YOU FEELING, HONESTLY, BETSY? I THINK IT'S KIND OF A LITTLE DECISION TIME FOR US. >> [ COUGHS ] I'M FEELING FINE. I'M JUST SLOW. >> WELL, IF YOU WANT TO KEEP GOING UP, I'LL STAY WITH YOU. BUT REALISTICALLY, AT THE SPEED WE'RE GOING, WE'RE LOOKING AT TWO HOURS MINIMUM, IF NOT MORE. THE TERRAIN IS STEEPER, LITTLE COLDER. REALLY, I'D LIKE TO NOT HAVE TO TURN BACK BETWEEN HERE AND THERE. SO, EITHER WE GET THERE, OR WE TURN BACK HERE. >> Narrator: BETSY'S HANDED DEAN A DILEMMA. HE'S IMPRESSED BY HER DETERMINATION, BUT HE'S NOT SURE SHE'LL MAKE IT. >> YOU GOT TWO MORE HOURS IN YOU? >> YEAH. I'M GOOD TO KEEP GOING. >> OKAY. ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU GET WARMED UP, THEN. >> ALL RIGHT. >> AND WE'LL CARRY ON. >> ALL RIGHT. >> Narrator: UP AT THE NORTH COL CAMP, THE OTHER CLIMBERS ARE WORRIED ABOUT ROD BABER, >> ROD DOESN'T LOOK GOOD -- JUST EYES IS... >> LYING DOWN? >> YEAH. YEAH, WE TOLD HIM NOT TO. >> HE'S TAKEN PAINKILLERS. HE'S TAKEN TOO MANY. >> Narrator: ROD'S DOSING UP ON PAINKILLERS, BUT THEY'RE NOT THE CURE. HE HAS THE CLASSIC SYMPTOMS OF ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS. >> HE DON'T WANT TO EAT NOTHING. HE'S JUST LYING AND... >> HAS HE GOT ENOUGH WATER? >> HE SAID HE HAD HALF A BOTTLE. >> OKAY, A HALF A BOTTLE. >> BRING HIM MORE LATER? >> YEAH, MAYBE WE GET HIS BOTTLE AND FILL IT UP. >> Narrator: AFTER 7 1/4 PAINFUL HOURS, BETSY ARRIVES AT CAMP 1, HIGHER THAN ANY POINT ON EARTH, OUTSIDE THE HIMALAYAS. >> IT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO ME. IT'S A SURPRISE TO EVERYBODY ELSE. [ CHUCKLES ] >> Narrator: ESPECIALLY THE GUIDES. >> TAKE CRAMPONS OFF AND GET WARM, OKAY? >> ALL RIGHT. >> OKAY? GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB. >> Narrator: BUT RUSSELL WILL DECIDE JUST HOW GOOD A JOB. BETSY ARRIVED TWO HOURS LATE. A PLACE ON THE SUMMIT TEAM IS FAR FROM GUARANTEED. UP HERE, THERE'S 44% OF THE OXYGEN THERE IS AT SEA LEVEL. IT'S A WRETCHED PLACE TO CAMP AND ONLY HALFWAY UP THE MOUNTAIN. THE GUIDES ARE INCREASINGLY WORRIED ABOUT ROD. >> WHAT DO YOU RECKON, DEAN, FROM THE BOTTLE -- HALF-LITER OR SOMETHING? >> WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS FOR A MINUTE. I RECKON GET SOME WATER INTO HIM FIRST. >> WELL, HE HAS BEEN HYDRATED. >> IS HE? >> Narrator: THEY'VE PERSUADED ROD TO GET UP AND HAVE SOME TEA, BUT HIS HEADACHE REMAINS. [ COUGHS ] BACK AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP, THERE'S STILL NO SIGHT OF THE KAZAK CLIMBERS, BUT THE SHERPA WHO LED THE RESCUE IS BACK AFTER AN 18-HOUR MISSION. >> YOU'VE HAD A LONG DAY. >> YEAH. [ SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] YEAH. YEAH. >> PHEW, YEAH, SURE. WELL DONE. >> Narrator: AND THEN, THE FIRST SIGN OF THE MISSING CLIMBERS... OR JUST ONE. ONLY MAX HAS RETURNED. >> IS THAT MAXUT I JUST SAW UP THERE? >> OH, MAXUT, YEAH. >> IS THAT MAXUT? >> [ COUGHS ] >> [ EXHALES ] >> Narrator: IT'S A HUGE RELIEF. THE OTHER CLIMBER IS STILL ALIVE. >> OH, IS THIS VASSILY? >> IT'S VASSILY? >> Narrator: 29 HOURS AFTER HE REACHED THE SUMMIT, VASSILY ARRIVES BACK AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP. HE'S IN A BAD WAY COMPARED WITH MAX. THEIR CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THE WORLD WITHOUT BOTTLED OXYGEN HAS TAKEN THEM TO THE LIMITS OF HUMAN ENDURANCE. >> A LITTLE FROSTBITE? >> DEFINITELY PUT THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE. THESE ARE TOP ATHLETES, AND THIS HAPPENED TO THEM. >> WE HAVE A LONG, LONG DAY. TWO DAYS WITHOUT WATER -- IT'S -- IT'S NO GOOD. >> AN INCREDIBLE ACHIEVEMENT, TO GET ONTO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST WITHOUT OXYGEN -- I MEAN, A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE HAVE DONE THAT, AND THAT'S AMAZING. >> Narrator: THE KAZAKS HAVE LIVED TO TELL THE TALE, BUT UP AT THE NORTH COL, ROD IS FACING A GRIM NIGHT. HIS EVEREST DREAM IS HANGING BY A THREAD. >> Narrator: DAWN AT 23,000 FEET, NEARLY 4 1/2 MILES ABOVE SEA LEVEL. RUSSELL BRICE'S CLIMBERS HAVE SPENT THEIR FIRST NIGHT AT EXTREME ALTITUDE. ROD BABER BARELY SLEPT AND HATED EVERY MINUTE. >> THE WORST MOMENTS WERE HUGE, MASSIVE, CHRONIC, SONIC, MEGA HEADACHE. IT'S LIKE A POUNDING SLEDGEHAMMER CONTINUOUSLY BANGING YOUR HEAD. WHEN I GOT HERE YESTERDAY, I WAS LITERALLY CRYING BECAUSE OF THE PAIN, AND I HAVEN'T DONE THAT EVER. GOING RIGHT DOWN TO ABC, AND THEN WE'VE GOT TWO DAYS HOLIDAY. HOORAY! >> AW, IT WAS ALL RIGHT -- A BIT COLD IN THE NIGHT. THAT'S WHAT IT ALWAYS IS, AND SLEEPING PATTERN ON AND OFF. BUT, YOU KNOW, FIRST TIME UP TO NORTH COL -- SLEEPING, YOU ALWAYS SUFFER. >> Narrator: THE FIRST THING MOGENS DOES IS VISIT THE KAZAK CLIMBERS. LIKE THEM, HE'S DETERMINED TO SUMMIT EVEREST WITHOUT OXYGEN. >> WHAT WAS THE MOST SCARY MOMENT YOU EXPERIENCED? >> NO FOOD, NO GAS, NO STOVES, NO MATCHES, NOTHING, TWO DAYS WITHOUT WATER. >> YEAH. WHEW. >> Narrator: YET MOGENS IS STILL OBSESSED WITH JOINING THIS ELITE CLUB. MEMBERSHIP IS LETHALLY DANGEROUS, AS HE DISCOVERED LAST YEAR, WHEN HE FAILED 3,000 FEET FROM THE SUMMIT. >> HOW YOU DOING? >> [ SNIFFS ] >> IT'S OKAY. >> I WAS JUST FEELING REALLY GOOD. AND THEN THE NEXT MINUTE IT'S LIKE, "[BLEEP] I'M GONNA DIE HERE." >> DO YOU THINK RUSSELL'S TENT BEING THERE MAYBE SAVED YOUR LIFE? >> YEAH, SURE. >> SO HIGH. >> YEAH, OF COURSE. >> AND WITHOUT OXYGEN. >> TAKE EVERYTHING. JUST DON'T TOUCH OXYGEN BOTTLE. >> NO, EXACTLY. NO OXYGEN. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. CONGRATULATIONS. >> THANK YOU. >> STRONG BOYS. >> Narrator: BETSY FEELS AS EXHAUSTED AS THE KAZAKS, AND SHE'S ONLY BEEN HALFWAY UP THE MOUNTAIN. >> EVERY STEP YOU GO UP, IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE AND MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT, BUT I'M NOT EXPECTING IT TO GET NICER. >> Narrator: EVEREST IS A MASSIVE CONTRAST TO LIFE BACK HOME FOR THE CALIFORNIAN. >> OH, IT WAS SO MISERABLE AND COLD THERE AND WINDY. OH, I HAVE SORES ALL OVER MY LIPS AND SORES ALL OVER MY FINGERS. I'M GONNA BE SO UGLY WHEN I GET HOME. I DON'T WANT TO MARRY A DOCTOR LIKE MY MOM SAID. I NEED TO MARRY A PLASTIC SURGEON SO THEY CAN PUT HUMPTY DUMPTY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. [ LAUGHS ] OH [BLEEP] >> Narrator: BETSY'S A BIG WORRY TO THE GUIDES, BUT RUSSELL ADMIRES DETERMINATION, SO HE'S DECIDED TO GIVE HER ONE MORE CHANCE. >> I'VE GOT TO GIVE HER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT OF AT LEAST GETTING TO NORTH COL. >> Narrator: BUT EVEN BETSY GOT BACK TO CAMP BEFORE BIKER TIM. HE'S LAST AGAIN. >> DID YOU FIND YOUR LITTLE SPOT IN THE GLACIER AGAIN? >> I ACTUALLY HAD A NICE LITTLE NAP. >> THERE YOU GO. >> I WAS GONNA CALL YOU ON THE RADIO, BUT I THOUGHT THAT IT'D WAKE YOU UP. >> I'M JUST IN TIME FOR LUNCH. >> OF COURSE. COME ON. IT 12:30. COME ON. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU THINK I'D BE LATE FOR LUNCH? >> WOULD YOU MISS LUNCH? [ LAUGHTER ] >> Narrator: TIM HAS CONSISTENTLY IGNORED ORDERS TO BE ON TIME AND WORK WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM. RUSSELL'S ANGRY AT HIS LACK OF RESPECT, AND AS FAR AS HE'S CONCERNED, TIM STILL HAS A LOT TO PROVE. >> LAST YEAR, IF HE HAD LEFT ON TIME, I SUSPECT THAT HE WOULD HAVE REACHED THE SUMMIT ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE. IT WOULD TAKE A BIT LONGER TO GET DOWN, BUT HE DIDN'T. >> Narrator: AND NOW ANOTHER OF RUSSELL'S TEAM IS IN TROUBLE. DR. MONICA PIRIS HAS BEEN CALLED TO AN EMERGENCY. >> COLD. >> HOW ARE YOU FEELING? >> BETTER WITH OXYGEN. >> BETTER WITH OXYGEN. YEAH? >> Narrator: JAPANESE CLIMBER WAKUI MASAJI GOT SICK ON A SHORT TRAINING WALK. >> HE LABORED AN AWFUL LOT -- IT TOOK HIM 2 1/2 HOURS -- AND DIDN'T QUITE GET THERE, AND THEN ANOTHER HOUR AND 3/4 TO COME BACK. HE WAS HAVING TO STOP EVERY 50 METERS TO CATCH HIS BREATH. >> Narrator: MONICA SUSPECTS HE HAS CEREBRAL EDEMA, SWELLING OF THE BRAIN. >> ONE FOOT RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER. >> [ SPEAKING JAPANESE ] [ MONITOR BEEPING ] >> SIT HERE, AND I LISTEN TO HIS CHEST. >> YEAH. >> ASK HIM TO TAKE DEEP BREATHS. >> Narrator: AT SEA LEVEL, 100% BLOOD OXYGEN IS NORMAL. AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP, 75% IS COMMON. ANYWHERE ELSE, THAT LEVEL WOULD PUT YOU IN INTENSIVE CARE. MASAJI HAS ONLY 50%. HE HASN'T GOT ENOUGH RED BLOOD CELLS TO CARRY THE OXYGEN HE NEEDS AROUND HIS BODY. >> HIS CHEST IS STILL OKAY. THIS IS LOW. BACK TO BED. >> [ SPEAKING JAPANESE ] THE UNSTEADINESS ON HIS FEET, WHICH WE CALL ATAXIA, THAT'S -- IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST SIGNS OF CEREBRAL EDEMA. SO, YOU KNOW, I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM. >> Narrator: IF MASAJI DOES HAVE CEREBRAL EDEMA, HIS DREAM OF CLIMBING EVEREST WILL BE OVER. >> THE DOCTOR WILL CHECK HIM AGAIN LATER, AND, YEAH, IT'S A DEFINITE CEREBRAL EDEMA. FINISHED. CAN NEVER COME BACK. >> Narrator: IT'S A NEW DAY AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP, BUT IT'S LOOKING GRIM FOR JAPANESE CLIMBER WAKUI MASAJI. HE'S GOTTEN WORSE OVERNIGHT, AND EXPEDITION DR. MONICA PIRIS ORDERS HIM DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. >> AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, HE HAS CEREBRAL EDEMA, AND THE ONLY TREATMENT FOR CEREBRAL EDEMA IS DESCENT. HE DOES NOT HAVE PULMONARY EDEMA. HIS CHEST IS OKAY. HE HAS ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS AND A LITTLE BIT OF CEREBRAL EDEMA. >> [ SPEAKING JAPANESE ] >> Narrator: IT'S THE END OF THE ROAD FOR MASAJI. ONLY ONE IN THREE CLIMBERS MAKES IT TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST. HE WON'T BE ONE OF THEM. >> OKAY. BASE CAMP. >> [ SPEAKING JAPANESE ] >> OKAY. >> Narrator: MONICA'S GOT HER WORK CUT OUT FOR HER THIS MORNING. MEMBERS OF THE FILM CREW ARE ALSO REELING WITH SYMPTOMS OF ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS. >> OKAY, ALL RIGHT. >> SORRY. >> AT THIS ALTITUDE, PEOPLE DON'T GET BETTER. THEY GET WORSE. ALMOST ALL CASES OF CEREBRAL EDEMA FROM HIGH ALTITUDE ARE ON THE BACK OF SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN SUFFERING FROM MOUNTAIN SICKNESS AND HASN'T TREATED IT OR GONE DOWN. SO IT'S POTENTIALLY SERIOUS, POTENTIALLY FATAL. WE'VE GOT TO GO. >> ARE YOU TELLING ME I'VE GOT TO GO DOWN? >> YEAH. DON'T GET AGGRESSIVE. >> I'M NOT GETTING AGGRESSIVE. I'M GETTING SLIGHTLY ANNOYED. I WALK, WHEN I'M TIRED, THAT SAME WALK. >> THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA OF ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS -- HEADACHE PLUS NAUSEA AND VOMITING OR POOR SLEEP OR FATIGUE AND LETHARGY. >> ALL OF THE ABOVE. >> ALL OF THE ABOVE. YOU HAVE ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS, JOHN. YOU'RE TICKING ALL THE BOXES. YOU'RE EVEN TICKING THE DENIAL BOX. >> YEAH. [ BOTH LAUGH ] >> YOU'RE TICKING ALL THE BOXES. >> Narrator: THE LAST THING THE CREW FEELS LIKE IS A 14-MILE HIKE BACK DOWN TO BASE CAMP, BUT MONICA HAS NO CHOICE. >> THEY'RE JUST NOT WELL, YOU KNOW? THEY'VE GOT BAD A.M.S., AND THE TREATMENT FOR BAD A.M.S. IS GO DOWN. THERE'S JUST NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT. >> Narrator: THOSE WHO REMAIN FACE THE HARSHEST TEST YET -- A GRUELING TREK TO CAMP 2 AT 24,500 FEET TO COMPLETE THEIR ACCLIMATION. ONLY THEN WILL RUSSELL PICK HIS SUMMIT TEAM. THE CLIMB WILL MAKE EXTREME DEMANDS ON THE TEAM, SO THEY HAVE TWO DAYS TO RELAX. >> LET'S GET IT ON. [ ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ] >> Narrator: BUT WHILE THE CLIMBERS REST, THEIR BODIES ARE PRODUCING THE EXTRA RED BLOOD CELLS THEY'LL NEED WHEN THEY CLIMB HIGHER UP THE MOUNTAINS. SHERPAS ARE BETTER ABLE TO WORK AT ALTITUDE BECAUSE THEY WERE BORN AND RAISED IN THE HIMALAYAS. YOU WASH WHEN YOUR CONSCIENCE DICTATES AT ABC. ALL THE WATER COMES FROM ICE HACKED OUT OF A GLACIER AND HAULED TO THE COOK TENT. >> I HAVEN'T WASHED MYSELF FOR TWO WEEKS NOW. >> Narrator: EVEN WHEN THE CLIMBERS ARE CHILLING OUT, THEY CAN'T RESIST A LITTLE FRIENDLY COMPETITION. >> IT'S NOT! [ LAUGHTER ] 10 AND 10. >> SO, WHAT HAPPENS? >> SO, I WIN. >> FAR FROM IT BEING ALTITUDE, I THINK IT'S PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE. [ LAUGHS ] >> IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO RE-ENERGIZE YOURSELF, YOUR BEING, AND RELAX. SO I QUITE LIKE DOWNTIME. AND IT HELPS YOU ACCLIMATIZE, AS WELL. AND WITHOUT IT, THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT. SO, YEAH, POWER TO DOWNTIME. >> Narrator: THEY'LL NEED THEIR REST. THE CLIMB TO CAMP 2 WILL BE THE HARDEST TEST YET. >> I THINK WE'LL START WEEDING OUT THE MEN FROM THE BOYS. >> Narrator: GOOD FOOD IS VITAL TO THE TEAM'S CHANCES OF SUCCESS. >> MY THEORY IS EAT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN DOWN HERE, AND THEN HOPEFULLY THOSE RESERVES WILL GET YOU TO THE TOP. >> YOU TRY TO, LIKE, ENJOY IT, CONSIDERING THE TORTURE WE'RE BEING PUT THROUGH. >> I FEEL MUCH BETTER THAN I DID A WEEK AGO, AND MAYBE BECAUSE I'VE ACCLIMATIZED. I'M HOPING IT IS BECAUSE LAST TIME I WENT UP THERE IT WAS PRETTY BAD. FOR SOME REASON, THE HEADACHE'S GONE, AND EVERYTHING'S GONE, SO, YEAH. SO I'M NOT TOO WORRIED. >> Narrator: AS THE CLIMBERS SET OFF, THEY KNOW THAT IF THEY FAIL TO REACH CAMP 2, IT'S ALL OVER. THEY WON'T BE ON THE SUMMIT TEAM. >> Narrator: THE TEAM HAS LEFT ADVANCED BASE CAMP FOR THE HIGHEST POINT YET -- CAMP 2 AT 24,500 FEET. IT'S BETSY HUELSKAMP'S LAST CHANCE TO CONVINCE RUSSELL SHE'S GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS SUMMIT TEAM, AND HE'S RULED THAT SHE MUST CLIMB WITHOUT THE HELP OF A GUIDE. ONCE AGAIN, MOGENS JENSEN HAS BLAZED AN EASY TRAIL AND IS FAR AHEAD OF THE OTHERS, DESPITE BEING A CHRONIC ASTHMATIC. >> I'M CONSERVING AS MUCH ENERGY AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S A VIEW...TO DIE FOR... ALMOST. >> Narrator: ALREADY BETSY'S STRUGGLING AND SHOWING NO SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT AFTER TWO DAYS OFF. >> I'M REALLY TIRED. I'M WILLING TO PAY $50 FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO CARRY MY BACKPACK. >> Narrator: SO FAR, THE MOUNTAIN GODS ARE SMILING ON ENGLISHMAN ROD BABER. >> THERE'S NO HEADACHES THIS TIME. WE'RE GOING AT A REASONABLE PACE. >> Narrator: THE WEATHER HAS CLOSED IN. BUT BIKER TIM IS A DRIVEN MAN. >> YEAH! >> Narrator: DRIVEN BY FAILURE. IT'S ONE YEAR SINCE HE TURNED BACK ONLY 320 FEET FROM THE TOP OF THE WORLD. >> JUST READY. I'M STRONGER AND FASTER, KNOW WHAT'S IN FRONT OF ME, BEEN HERE BEFORE, HUNGRY...REAL HUNGRY. GOT TO SEE WHAT'S AROUND THAT CORNER WHERE I GOT TURNED AROUND. IT'S BEEN EATING ME UP FOR A YEAR. I LOVE THIS, MAN. IT'S SNOW, SPIKES ON MY FEET, BACKPACK ON, GOT MY MUSIC, ICE PICK. THIS IS GREAT, MAN. DON'T GET NO BETTER THAN THIS. COMES DOWN TO IT, MAN, THIS IS LIVING. SO, LET'S GET IT ON. BAM! >> Narrator: ALL THE TEAMS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE FIRST LEG OF THE CLIMB, WHERE THEY ENDURE ANOTHER NIGHT IN SUB-ZERO TEMPERATURES AT THE NORTH COL. >> I HOPE THE WEATHER IS GONNA BE FINE. IT'S BEEN SNOWING A BIT DURING THE NIGHT, SO WE'LL SEE. >> Narrator: THE SECOND LEG OF THE CHALLENGE -- THE CLIMB TO CAMP 2 -- WILL PUSH THEM HARDER THAN EVER BEFORE. >> TODAY WE ARE GOING ALL THE WAY UP THERE, TO CAMP 2. IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD TAKE NO MORE THAN AN HOUR. BUT IT'S VERY DECEIVING. >> Narrator: THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN A TARGET TIME OF FIVE HOURS TO REACH CAMP 2. >> A BIG PART OF THIS MOUNTAIN IS MENTAL, YOU KNOW? A LOT OF TIMES, YOUR MIND'S GONNA TELL YOU, "TURN AROUND. TURN AROUND. YOU CAN'T GO ANY FURTHER." AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE THE OUTCOME TODAY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. THEY DON'T DIG DEEP, THEY AIN'T GONNA MAKE IT. >> Narrator: BETSY KNOWS IT'S HER LAST TIME TO IMPRESS GUIDE DEAN STAPLES AND SECURE A PLACE ON THE SUMMIT TEAM. >> SO, YOU HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP THEN? >> A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP? >> WELL, RELATIVE FOR -- >> IS THAT AN OXYMORON? YEAH. ONE-PIECE SUIT WEATHER OR -- >> DEFINITELY. >> YOU HAVE YOURS TIED AROUND YOUR WAIST. >> YEAH, SO, ALWAYS PUT THE SUIT ON BECAUSE WE'RE A LITTLE BIT SHELTERED HERE. IT FEELS QUITE WARM. AND SOMETIMES YOU'RE OVERHEATING, EVEN WITH YOUR SUIT ON. IF YOU'RE HOT, JUST TIE IT 'ROUND YOUR WAIST. OFTEN YOU WALK ABOUT 50 METERS HERE, YOU'RE IN THE COLD, WIND COMES ACROSS. AND THERE'S NO WAY -- IT'S A QUITE A STEEP SLOPE TO TRY AND CHANGE AND PUT A DOWN SUIT ON. YOU LOSE A BOOT OR SOMETHING, IT'S ALL QUITE SERIOUS. >> Narrator: THE NORTH RIDGE IS NOTORIOUS FOR SUDDEN WINDS THAT CAN TURN SEARING HEAT TO SAVAGE COLD IN SECONDS. RUSSELL BRICE FORBIDS HIS CLIMBERS TO STEP ONTO THE RIDGE UNLESS THEY'RE WEARING A DOWN SUMMIT SUIT. >> [ INDISTINCT SPEAKING OVER RADIO ] >> Narrator: IT'S THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE YEAR ON EVEREST, AND EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING IN THE GRUELING CONDITIONS. BUT THE HEAT, ALTITUDE, AND HER LACK OF EXPERIENCE HAVE HIT BETSY HARDEST OF ALL. NONE OF THE CLIMBERS EXPECTED THIS. EVEN MOGENS JENSEN IS FINDING IT HARD. BUT BETSY ISN'T MOVING AT ALL. DEAN STAPLES IS WORRIED AND ALERTS THE OTHER GUIDES. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK? >> GO AHEAD. >> HEY, WOODY. I'M GONNA HAVE TO DESCEND. SHE'S BEEN LYING IN THE SNOW FOR THE LAST 10, 15 MINUTES, SO I DON'T KNOW. I'VE GOT TO GO DOWN AND CHECK IT OUT. SO, I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL. LATER. >> YEAH, THAT'S FINE. >> Narrator: DEAN'S SCARED THAT BETSY MIGHT BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE. SHE MAY HAVE BEEN HIT BY HEAT EXHAUSTION, ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS, OR EVEN CEREBRAL EDEMA, ANY OF WHICH COULD BE FATAL. NEXT TIME, HAS BETSY'S DETERMINATION TO SUCCEED PUSHED HER ONE STEP TOO FAR? AND THE REST OF THE TEAM ARE REELING AS THEY CONTINUE THE FIGHT UP TO CAMP 2. >> THE SUN WAS BEATING DOWN ON US SO HARD, AND IT WAS KILLING ME. >> Narrator: JUDGMENT DAY LOOMS FOR THE CLIMBERS... >> WE'RE NOT SURE THAT YOU CAN DO IT. >> Narrator: ...AS RUSSELL DECIDES WHO IS ON AND WHO IS OFF THE TEAM.
