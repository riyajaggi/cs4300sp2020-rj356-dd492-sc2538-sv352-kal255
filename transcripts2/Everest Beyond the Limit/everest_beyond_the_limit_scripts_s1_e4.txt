 Narrator: DAY 43. WITHOUT BOTTLED OXYGEN, 33-YEAR-OLD MOGENS HAS KEPT UP HIS AMAZING PACE AND ARRIVES AT CAMP 3 WITH TERRY AND TEAM 1. OH, THAT WAS NICE. NOW THEY'RE PINNED DOWN. AT 25,900 FEET, CAMP 3 IS ALMOST TWICE THE HEIGHT OF THE TALLEST PEAK IN THE AMERICAN ROCKIES. TERRY AND MOGENS MUST CLIMB 1,600 FEET TO CAMP 4 TO BE IN STRIKING DISTANCE FOR THE SUMMIT ATTEMPT THAT BEGINS AT 1:00 A.M., NEXT MORNING. RUSSELL MUST LOOK AT HIS FORECASTS AND DECIDE WHETHER TO PUSH TERRY AND MOGENS INTO THE DEATH ZONE, A LETHAL BELT OF ALTITUDE THAT BEGINS JUST ABOVE CAMP 3 AND EXTENDS TO THE SUMMIT. THE TEAM IS HOT TO GO, BUT RUSSELL IS CAUTIOUS. IT'S NOT THAT BAD UP HERE RIGHT NOW -- I MEAN, AGAIN, AROUND 20 PLUS. I'M SURE WE CAN GET UP TO 4. YEAH, I'VE GOT ANOTHER FORECAST. YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO DECIPHER IT. RUSSELL DOESN'T FOLLOW HIS FORECASTS BLINDLY. HE INTERPRETS THE DATA, BACKED BY YEARS OF WATCHING THE MOUNTAIN'S DEVASTATING SWINGS OF MOOD. Russell: YEAH, THE WIND TODAY IS DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS WHEN THE SNOW CAME. HERE WE ARE -- OUR SUMMIT DAYS. NOW WE'VE GOT A BUMP OF HUMIDITY IN HERE, WHICH IS WHAT WE CAN SEE OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW, AND THAT'S NOT PARTICULARLY GOOD FOR US. Narrator: RUSSELL AGONIZES OVER THE WEATHER BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT A DELAY COULD MEAN FOR MOGENS. MOGENS SUFFERS FROM EXERCISE-INDUCED ASTHMA AND KEEPS IT IN CHECK WITH MEDICATION. BUT WITHOUT BOTTLED OXYGEN, HE'S MORE VULNERABLE TO HIGH-ALTITUDE SICKNESS THAN THE OTHERS. WE THOUGHT THAT THE WIND MIGHT DROP, AND WE'D BE ABLE TO MOVE, AND IT MIGHT STILL DROP ENOUGH FOR US TO GET UP THIS AFTERNOON. Narrator: IF RUSSELL SENDS TERRY AND MOGENS NOW, THEY FACE POSSIBLE FROSTBITE IN THE FREEZING WINDS. BUT IF HE KEEPS THEM AN EXTRA NIGHT AT CAMP 3, OTHER EXPEDITIONS COULD PASS THEM DURING A LULL IN THE WEATHER. BILL, WOODY? Bill: Yeah, copy, Russ. Okay, I'm sort of figuring LET'S HANG TIGHT WHERE WE ARE, AND WE MIGHT GET SLIGHTLY BETTER FOR 13th AND 14th, OVER. YEAH, COPY THAT. AND IT LOOKS LIKE, EVEN TOMORROW, YOU'LL HAVE A BIT MORE WIND DOWN LOWER THAN YOU WILL UP HIGH. I think we will just KNOCK IT ON THE HEAD TODAY -- I'M SORRY, GUYS -- AND START AGAIN TOMORROW. YEAH, DON'T BE SORRY, RUSS. IT'S THE BEST CALL OUT THERE. SO, WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP AHEAD OF THE GAME, SO LET'S JUST PLAN ON TOMORROW MORNING. LET'S MAKE IT ROLL. Narrator: RUSSELL HAS ORDERED THE TEAM TO STAY AN EXTRA NIGHT AT CAMP 3. MOGENS? YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU NEED, I KNOW. HOW DO YOU FEEL? YEAH, ROGER THAT. RUSSELL'S DECISION HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT ON TIM AND MARK, NOW WAITING 1,400 FEET BELOW TERRY AND MOGENS, AT CAMP 2. HOURS COUNT ON EVEREST. OTHER EXPEDITIONS ARE HEADED UP THE MOUNTAIN, AND THE ALTITUDE CLOCK IS TICKING FOR MOGENS. DAY 44, 7:00 A.M., ADVANCED BASE CAMP. MOGENS' LUNGS ARE CLEAR, AND THE WEATHER CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED AT 25,900 FEET. IT'S THE MORNING OF MAY THE 13th, 2006. WE'RE AT CAMP 3, 7,900 METERS. HEADED UP TO CAMP 4 TODAY. DOING WELL DESPITE SPENDING A COUPLE NIGHTS HERE, AND JUST GONNA TRY AND TAKE IT EASY, TAKE MY TIME. Narrator: AS HIS TEAMMATES TURN ON THEIR OXYGEN VALVES, MOGENS TURNS ON THE WILLPOWER. MOGENS IS A MOUNTAINEERING PURIST, WHO BELIEVES THE ONLY WAY TO MEASURE HIMSELF AGAINST NATURE IS TO USE THE BODY HE WAS BORN WITH. THE MOMENT MOGENS AND TERRY CLIMB 100 FEET ABOVE CAMP 3, THEY ENTER THE DEATH ZONE. HERE, THE EXTREME ALTITUDE SHUTS DOWN DIGESTION, AND THE BODY CONSUMES ITS OWN MUSCLE TISSUE FOR ENERGY. NO ONE'S EVER SURVIVED THE DEATH ZONE FOR MORE THAN FIVE DAYS. THE AIR IS SO THIN, EVEN WITH BOTTLED OXYGEN, THE BODY STILL CRAVES MORE. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] EACH MAN STRUGGLES TO STAY ON THE ICY LEDGES. ONLY THE SHERPA SAFETY LINES KEEP THEM FROM FALLING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] BUT JUST 15 MINUTES INTO THE CLIMB, MOGENS HAS FALLEN BEHIND TERRY AND THE OTHERS. MOGENS NOW FIGHTS TO STAY ON THE MOUNTAIN AS THE DEATH ZONE CLOSES AROUND HIM. Narrator: THE REST OF THE TEAM IS FAR UP THE MOUNTAIN WHEN MOGENS CHECKS IN WITH THEIR GUIDE, BILL. MOEGNS IS HAVING A BAD DAY. AND HE'S DECIDED TO TURN AROUND AND GO DOWN. HE'S DIZZY, NAUSEOUS, FEELING NOT VERY GOOD. Narrator: WHILE RUSSELL REMAINS CONCERNED ABOUT MOGENS, HE KNOWS THAT A CAMERAMAN FROM THE "EVEREST" FILM CREW IS WATCHING OVER HIM. RUSSELL MUST NOW TURN HIS ATTENTION TO MOVING THE EXPEDITION HEADQUARTERS UP THE MOUNTAIN TO NORTH COL, CAMP 1. ALL RUSSELL LEAVES BEHIND AT ABC IS AN OFFERING TO PROTECT HIS CLIMBERS, THE SHERPAS, AND MOGENS. Man: CHEERS, BIG BOSS. YEAH, SEE YOU. I'M GETTING TOO OLD FOR ALL THIS, YOU KNOW? I HAVE TO WALK FOR 2 1/2 HOURS TO GET TO WORK IN THE MORNING. BLOODY HELL. Narrator: RUSSELL NOW MAKES THE TEDIOUS CLIMB UP THE ICE CLIFF TO NORTH COL. HIS TEAMS ARE NOW ALL OVER THE MOUNTAIN. TERRY AND BILL INCH UP TO CAMP 4, AS MOGENS STRUGGLES DOWN TO CAMP 3. TIM AND MARK WILL SOON BE THERE, AS WELL. THEIR GUIDE, WOODY, IS FIRST TO ARRIVE AND FINDS MOGENS IN THE EARLY PHASE OF ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS. I CAN SEE YOUR LIPS ARE QUITE BLUE, OKAY? SO I KNOW IT'S A DIRTY WORD... [ CHUCKLES ] ...BUT I THINK IF YOU'RE JUST EVEN ON, YOU KNOW, HALF A LITER OR ONE LITER... JUST RELAX. YEAH, IT'LL JUST GET THE OXYGEN FLOWING AROUND YOUR BODY AGAIN. LET ME FEEL YOUR HANDS. YEAH, THEY'RE A LITTLE... YOU'RE NOT TOO BAD. WELL, IT'S GONNA ALLEVIATE... YEAH. ...WHAT PROBLEMS YOU DO HAVE. OKAY. MOGENS, YOU'VE SUCCUMBED TO THE DARK SIDE! [ CHUCKLES ] HOPEFULLY, IT'LL START MAKING HIM FEEL A BIT BETTER, OTHERWISE, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO REASSESS, SEE HOW HE'S FEELING IN 20 OR 30 MINUTES. FEELING BETTER NOW, MOGENS? TIM, MARK, AND THE REST OF TEAM 2 NOW TRICKLE INTO CAMP 3 BEHIND WOODY. OKAY, I'LL CATCH YOU NEXT TIME. THIS MAN -- GREAT MOUNTAINEER... AWESOME CLIMBER. HE CAN OUTCLIMB ME ANY DAY. OH, IT WAS NICE TO USE OXYGEN. [ COUGHS ] Narrator: NO ONE THOUGHT TIM WOULD EVER GET THIS FAR. THE BIKER HAS SUFFERED TWO MOTORCYCLE CRASHES, AND HIS BACK IS HELD TOGETHER WITH METAL BRACES AND BOLTS. [ CHUCKLES ] I RESPOND BETTER UNDER PRESSURE. THANKS, MATE. MOGENS MUST DESCEND BECAUSE OXYGEN ONLY ALLEVIATES HIS SYMPTOMS. FULL RECOVERY REQUIRES AT LEAST TWO DAYS AT LOWER ALTITUDE. NORTH COL, NORTH COL. RUSSELL FROM WOODY. [ Russell talking indistinctly ] MOGENS IS JUST LEAVING CAMP 3 NOW. [ WOODY TALKING INDISTINCTLY ] Narrator: FOR TWO YEARS RUNNING, MOGENS HAS CARRIED HIS DREAM UP THE MOUNTAIN. NOW, TO SAVE HIMSELF, HE MUST LEAVE HIS DREAM BEHIND ONCE AGAIN. Narrator: NORTH COL, CAMP 1 -- JUST OVER 4 MILES HIGH. RUSSELL'S SET UP SHOP IN HIS NEW HEADQUARTERS. FROM HERE, HE HAS A CLEAR VIEW OF THE SUMMIT RIDGE AND GOOD RADIO RECEPTION WITH HIS TEAMS. I'LL JUST TAKE ONE OF THESE REGULATORS, BATTERIES. AH, HERE'S THE RADIO. Narrator: BOTH TEAMS WILL MAKE SEPARATE PUSHES TO THE TOP IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS. RUSSELL WON'T SLEEP UNTIL THEY LEAVE THE SUMMIT AND DEATH ZONE FOR GOOD. I'M GONNA BE STUCK HERE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS, REALLY, AND, HOPEFULLY, GET EVERYONE UP AND DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. Narrator: MOGENS STRUGGLES INTO NORTH COL AFTER A PAINFUL 4-HOUR TREK DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. SORRY, MOGENS. RUSSELL SUSPECTS HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR PUSHING MOGENS OVER THE EDGE, WHEN HE HELD THE DANISH CLIMBER NEAR THE DEATH ZONE AN EXTRA NIGHT. NO. AT CAMP 4, TERRY PREPARES FOR WHAT MAY BE THE GREATEST DAY OF HIS LIFE. AT 27,500 FEET, IT'S MORE OF A REST STOP THAN AN OVERNIGHT. TERRY AND BILL HAVE JUST ENOUGH TIME TO DRINK FLUIDS, FORCE DOWN SOME FOOD, AND GRAB A FEW HOURS OF SLEEP BEFORE THE SUMMIT PUSH AT 1:00 A.M. O'Connor: YOU'RE JUST THERE FOR A REALLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. YOU KIND OF ARRIVE, AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT MAYBE FOUR OR FIVE HOURS OF SOME DOWN TIME. Narrator: THREE OF THE SHERPAS WEAR HELMET-MOUNTED CAMERAS ON THE TREACHEROUS CLIMB TO THE SUMMIT. NONSTOP VIDEO WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO BASE CAMP. NO EVEREST CLIMB HAS EVER BEEN COVERED IN SUCH MINUTE-BY-MINUTE DETAIL. AT MIDNIGHT, TERRY AND BILL SORT THEIR GEAR. AT THIS ALTITUDE, EVERY POUND FEELS LIKE 10, SO ONLY ESSENTIALS CAN BE TAKEN. 1:13 A.M. THE LAST LEG OF THE SUMMIT ATTEMPT BEGINS IN TOTAL DARKNESS ON A STEEP, FROZEN RIDGE. THE CLIMBERS MUST HOOK ON TO THE ROPE RIGGED WEEKS AGO BY RUSSELL'S SHERPAS. THE REST ARE FROM PREVIOUS SEASONS AND COULD SNAP WITHOUT WARNING. TERRY AND THE OTHER CLIMBERS USE A METAL RING CALLED A CARABINER TO ATTACH THEMSELVES TO THE SAFETY LINE. ANOTHER DEVICE, THE ASCENDER, ALLOWS THEM TO GRIP AND LOCK ON TO THE ROPE AND PULL HIGHER. Russell: Bill, you copy? YEAH, RUSS, GO AHEAD. THEY LEAVE EARLY TO ALLOW JUST ENOUGH TIME TO STAND AT THE SUMMIT A FEW MINUTES AND RETREAT BELOW THE DEATH ZONE IN DAYLIGHT. TERRY MUST NOW CLIMB UP THE NORTH RIDGE, TO A SMALL ROCK FACE CALLED THE FIRST STEP. BUT RUSSELL'S DECISION TO DELAY THE TEAM AT CAMP 3 COMES BACK TO HAUNT TERRY AND BILL. Terry: COME ON. Bill: AH, COME ON! OTHER EXPEDITIONS CAUGHT UP WITH RUSSELL'S TEAM WHILE THEY HELD AT CAMP 3... ...AND THIS MORNING, AS TERRY SLEPT, THEY WERE PASSED. RUSSELL'S NERVE CENTER IS NOW REDUCED TO HIS SLEEPING BAG. IT'S 20 DEGREES BELOW -- SO COLD THAT EVERYTHING INSIDE IS COVERED IN ICE CRYSTALS. LOOKS LIKE -- WHAT I DIDN'T WANT TO HAPPEN IS BE A LOT OF PEOPLE UP THERE. SO IT SLOWED PROGRESS UP THE EXIT CRACKS. Narrator: THE EXIT CRACKS ARE A SERIES OF ROCKY LEDGES BETWEEN CAMP 4 AND THE NORTHEAST RIDGE. IT'S A TOUGH PLACE TO PASS, BUT SUDDENLY, THERE'S A FAR GREATER CHALLENGE. 4:01 A.M. TERRY FINDS BILL BEFORE HE PASSES OUT, THANKS TO RUSSELL'S SAFETY NET OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS. JUST AS TERRY AND THE TEAM START TO MAKE PROGRESS AGAIN, THEY HIT BUMPER-TO-BUMPER TRAFFIC AT THE FIRST STEP. [ LAUGHS ] LET'S GO! COME ON! COME ON! LET US GO! Narrator: 4:43 A.M. TERRY AND BILL ARE HOPELESSLY STALLED BEHIND A GROUP OF SLOW CLIMBERS. 4:45, AND THEY'RE STILL ONLY AT THE FIRST STEP. SO THERE'S A BIG BUNCH OF PEOPLE THERE. AND SLOW, APPARENTLY. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE, AND THIS IS BECOMING A BIT OF A WORRY. Narrator: IF THE LINE DOESN'T START MOVING, TERRY COULD RUN OUT OF OXYGEN BEFORE THE CLIMB IS OVER. TOO MANY PEOPLE HERE NOW... AND PEOPLE THAT AREN'T COMPETENT TO MOVE UP AND DOWN THE ROPES, THEY HOLD EVERYONE ELSE UP. Narrator: RUSSELL KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE HIS TEAMS MUST BE DURING THE SUMMIT ATTEMPT AND HOW MUCH OXYGEN MUST REMAIN FOR THEIR SAFE RETURN. IF TERRY USES TOO MUCH OXYGEN, RUSSELL WILL CALL HIM BACK. BILL AND TERRY MANAGE TO PUSH PAST SOME CLIMBERS TO REACH MUSHROOM ROCK. HERE, THEY NEED TO CHANGE OXYGEN BOTTLES. THE NEW BOTTLE GIVES THEM EIGHT HOURS TO SUMMIT AND RETURN TO THIS SAME POSITION. THE "OXYGEN CLOCK" IS NOW TICKING. Ken: LET SOMEBODY GO ON UP. GO! THE BOTTLENECKS ARE LOCATED IN THREE STEPS -- THE MOST INTIMIDATING SECTIONS OF THE MOUNTAIN. EACH ONE REQUIRES SCALING A ROCK FACE. THE SECOND STEP IS NEARLY 100 FEET HIGH. Russell: IT'S NOT TECHNICALLY DIFFICULT, BUT WITH A LOT OF CLIMBING GEAR AND OXYGEN MASKS AND THINGS, IT FEELS TO BE VERY EXPOSED AND TECHNICAL. AND THEN YOU COME ONTO A LADDER. THIS TENDS TO BE A BOTTLENECK. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THIS LADDER. THEY'RE NOT CONFIDENT TO PULL ON THE ROPES, AND THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A TRAFFIC JAM. Narrator: THE LADDER SPANS THE STEEPEST SECTION OF THIS SECOND STEP. ONLY ONE CLIMBER CAN SCALE IT AT A TIME. TERRY AND BILL HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO MINUS-40-DEGREE AIR FOR NEARLY FIVE HOURS NOW, AND THE SUN IS JUST BEGINNING TO RISE. RUSSELL MUST RELY ON HIS SHERPAS TO HELP THEM AROUND THE TRAFFIC JAM. NOW HE TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO MOGENS. AFTER A NIGHT'S REST AT CAMP 1, HE'S CLEARED TO HEAD DOWN TO ADVANCED BASE CAMP. OKAY? YEAH. YOU TAKE CARE, AND WE'LL SEE YOU DOWN THERE. WE'LL SEE WHAT WE'RE UP TO AFTER THAT. YEAH, SURE. YEAH, RUSS. YEAH, OKAY. BYE-BYE. TIME I START DOWN. OKAY. TERRY KNOWS THE NEXT CALL FROM RUSSELL TO BILL COULD BE AN ABORT, AND HIS SUMMIT COULD END IN A LONG RETREAT DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. IT'S SO COLD, THE CAMERAS ARE FREEZING UP, AND FROSTBITE CAN'T BE FAR BEHIND FOR THE TEAM. A LINE OF NOVICE CLIMBERS NOW BLOCK THE SUMMIT. MOST OF THEM DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH, SOME MAY BE OUT OF THEIR HEADS WITH ALTITUDE SICKNESS, AND NO ONE'S GIVING WAY. 6:31 A.M., SECOND STEP, MOUNT EVEREST. TERRY AND BILL CHANGED OXYGEN BOTTLES ONE HOUR AND 40 MINUTES AGO. EVEN IF THEY GET PAST THE JAM, THEY STILL HAVE AT LEAST A TWO-HOUR CLIMB TO THE SUMMIT. I'M JUST CALCULATING HOW MANY MINUTES THEY'VE BEEN AWAY FROM TOP CAMP. AND HOW MUCH OXYGEN THEY SHOULD HAVE LEFT. Narrator: AS THE CRISIS DEEPENS AT THE SECOND STEP, BRETT HIKES UP FROM ADVANCED BASE CAMP TO MEET MOGENS ON HIS WAY DOWN. WE CAME UP HERE TO GIVE HIM A HOT BLACK TEA AND TO RAISE HIS SPIRITS AND TO CARRY HIS PACK BACK. AFTER A TRUDGE OFF THAT MOUNTAIN LIKE THAT, I'M SURE HE'LL APPRECIATE IT A LOT. MOGENS IS A GREAT GUY. HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE. HE'S MY CLIMBING PARTNER FOR THIS TRIP, AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I SUPPORT HIM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. HOW YOU DOING? [ SNIFFLES ] IT'S OKAY. YOU DID GOOD. YOU DID GOOD. EVERYONE'S PROUD OF YOU. EVERYONE'S PROUD OF YOU. WE GOT SOME HOT TEA FOR YOUR BAD CRAMP, OKAY? Narrator: MOEGNS HAS NO DOUBT NOW WHAT WENT WRONG. Brett: THAT'S A PRETTY SCARY FEELING. YEAH [BLEEP] Narrator: BACK AT THE SECOND STEP, TERRY AND GUIDE BILL FINALLY GET A BREAK. THEY MANAGE TO MAKE IT ONTO THE LADDER AFTER A FULL AND FREEZING HOUR IN LINE. Ken: BEEN KIND OF AN INTERESTING MORNING SO FAR, EH, BILL? BEEN AN INTERESTING MORNING, KEN. HAD A COUPLE OF VERY, VERY SLOW PARTIES AND NOT VERY GOOD CLIMBERS. SO WE'VE BEEN MOVING EXTREMELY SLOW AND NOT VERY POLITE, EITHER, IN LETTING PEOPLE PASS THEM. THE TEAM'S PRETTY COLD. CRAMPONS ABOVE MY HEAD. THE TEAM GETS A REPRIEVE FROM RUSSELL WHO CALCULATES THEY HAVE JUST ENOUGH OXYGEN TO MAKE IT TO THE SUMMIT AND RETURN TO THEIR STASHED BOTTLES AT MUSHROOM ROCK. Terry: THANKFULLY, IT HASN'T BEEN TOO WINDY, BUT STILL DESPITE THAT, YOU KNOW... HANDS AND FEET PRETTY COLD, OFF AND ON. BESIDES THAT... EH, IT'S NICE TO BE ON THE SECOND STEP -- LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY. WELL, THAT JUST MADE IT WORTHWHILE. IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN THAT. THAT'S GOOD STUFF. Narrator: 8:22 A.M. TERRY HAS NOW CLIMBED FOR OVER SEVEN HOURS. HE'S CLEARED THE SECOND STEP BUT FACES TWO MORE HOURS TO REACH THE SUMMIT. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] WHILE TERRY AND GUIDE BILL CATCH THEIR BREATH, 2,300 FEET BELOW, MARK, TIM, AND GERARD PREPARE TO LEAVE CAMP 3. TODAY'S CLIMB LEADS THEM INTO THE DEATH ZONE. THEY'RE FOLLOWING TERRY'S FOOTSTEPS UP TO CAMP 4. AFTER A FEW HOURS OF SLEEP, THEY'LL HEAD FOR THE SUMMIT. KEEPING EXTREMITIES WARM IS CRITICAL BEFORE SETTING OFF. COLD FINGERS AND TOES IN THE MORNING CAN BE FROSTBITTEN BY NIGHT. TIM SACRIFICED HOURS OF SLEEP JUST TO KEEP WARM. HE'S TIRED, AND IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE FACING A GRUELING SUMMIT ATTEMPT. FOR MARK, THE CHALLENGES OF BEING A DOUBLE AMPUTEE ON EVEREST ARE MAKING THEMSELVES PAINFULLY FELT. TERRY IS FINALLY MAKING GOOD PROGRESS. Man: [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: HE CAN ALMOST TASTE THE SUMMIT, AND HIS MOOD LIGHTENS. Man: [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: TERRY NOW TAKES ON THE LAST OBSTACLE TO HIS DREAM -- AN OUTCROPPING CALLED THE DIHEDRAL. [ INDISTINCT TALKING OVER RADIO ] Russell: THEY'RE NOT FAR FROM THE SUMMIT NOW, SO IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES, WE'LL... PROBABLY BE HEARING -- [ RADIO CHATTER ] YES, SOME PEOPLE ON THE SUMMIT. YEAH, TERRY, SO YOU'RE JUST WAITING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A TURN TO GET ON THE TOP? YOU'RE JUST A FEW METERS BELOW, IS THAT RIGHT? Narrator: TERRY NOW MOVES UP THE MOST BIZARRE WAITING LINE ON THE PLANET, AND THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE ON EARTH HE'D RATHER BE. BUSY? YEAH. BUSY DAY UP HERE AT THE SUMMIT. JUST EXTREMELY THANKFUL THAT THE MOUNTAIN HAS DECIDED TO LET US UP TODAY, AND IT'S JUST A BEAUTIFUL VIEW. THERE'S HARDLY ANY WIND TODAY, AND I'M JUST SUPER HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS FOR THOSE WHO'VE BEEN CLIMBING FOR ME IN SPIRIT -- MY DAD, WHO DIED JUST A LITTLE UNDER A COUPLE YEARS AGO, MY GRANDFATHER, WHO PASSED AWAY JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, AND MY FRIEND CHARLIE... ...WHO TRAGICALLY DIED IN A CLIMBING ACCIDENT WHILE I WAS HERE ON THIS EXPEDITION. WELCOME TO HEAVEN, GUYS. THIS IS FOR YOU. HOPE I CAN MAKE YOU PROUD WHEN I GET BACK TO EARTH. [ CHUCKLES ] ...YOU'VE BEEN GOING FOR JUST UNDER 600 MINUTES, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH OXYGEN LEFT ON THE WAY BACK. SO I RECKON YOU SHOULD SPEND NO MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR ON THE SUMMIT, OVER. Narrator: THESE DAYS, REACHING THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST IS MORE LIKE ATTENDING A MOUNTAINEERING RALLY. EACH CLIMBER WAITS IN LINE FOR A TURN AT THE TOP. AND FOR EACH SECOND THEY WAIT, THERE'S A LITTLE LESS OXYGEN LEFT FOR THE DESCENT. I WAS JUST A LITTLE WORRIED THAT WE'D GET TOO FAR BEHIND WITH THAT TRAFFIC. BUT I GOT TONS OF ENERGY TO SPARE. I GOT NO PROBLEM GETTING DOWN TODAY. Narrator: TERRY'S OLD TEAMMATES, MOGENS AND BRETT, LISTEN IN AT ADVANCED BASE CAMP WITH MIXED EMOTIONS. MOGENS AND I ARE STANDING HERE, WATCHING OUR BUDDIES UP THERE. THAT'S OUR TEAM THAT'S SUMMITING TODAY, AND IT'S TOUGH NOT BEING UP THERE WITH THEM. IT'S NOT JEALOUSY. I JUST WANT TO BE UP THERE REALLY BAD. Man: YES, SUH-SUH-SUH-SIR! YEAH, YEAH! WHOO-HOO! WHOO! WHOO-HOO! Narrator: TERRY AND BILL FINALLY TAKE THEIR TURN ON TOP OF THE WORLD. BEEN A FULL DAY -- TRAFFIC JAMS, SNOW, COLD. NICE TO HAVE SOME SUN ON TOP. UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S A LITTLE SHORT. RUSS NEEDS US TO GO 'CAUSE WE'RE GETTING LOW ON O's. THEY'VE HAD 600 MINUTES OF OXYGEN. IT'S BEEN 10 HOURS SINCE THEY LEFT. THEY NEED TO GET DOWN QUICKLY, SO I'M NOT GONNA GIVE THEM MUCH TIME ON THE SUMMIT. THIS ONE'S FOR MY POPS. GOOD TO BE UP HERE WITH YOU, DAD. GLAD WE FINALLY MADE IT. [ CHUCKLES ] AND AS I ALWAYS SAY, GUYS, REMEMBER YOU'RE ONLY HALFWAY. YOU'VE GOT THE HARD PART TO DO NOW. Narrator: CONQUERING EVEREST DOESN'T END WITH A PHOTO AT THE SUMMIT. 80% OF ALL CLIMBING ACCIDENTS HAPPEN DURING DESCENT. FOR TERRY, THE BATTLE IS NOT OVER UNTIL HE'S THROUGH THE DEATH ZONE AND SAFELY IN CAMP. IT'S TIME TO GET OUT OF THE DEATH ZONE, AND IT'S A LONG CLIMB DOWN. THE EVEREST DREAM IS NOW A REALITY FOR TERRY O'CONNOR. HE AND BILL STAND ON THE HIGHEST POINT ON EARTH. OVER THE PAST 46 DAYS, THEY'VE SURVIVED EVERYTHING EVEREST THREW AT THEM -- ALL FOR A MERE 22 MINUTES ON THE SUMMIT. OKAY, SORRY, GUYS. SHORT TIME, BUT IT'S BEEN WORTHWHILE UP THERE, I THINK, AND YOU NEED TO GET GOING. Narrator: TERRY DEPARTS THE SUMMIT AFTER A BRUTAL, 10-HOUR CLIMB. DURING DESCENT, HIS ADRENALINE LEVEL FALLS, AND HIS ENERGY FADES. [ RADIO CRACKLES ] TERRY'S CAREER AS A DOCTOR DEPENDS ON HIS HANDS. NOW HE CAN BARELY HANG ON TO THE SAFETY LINE AT THIS SHEER DROP-OFF. AS HE STRUGGLES DOWN TO THE SECOND STEP, THE TRAFFIC JAM IS THICKER THAN EVER. Russell: I'M GETTING WORRIED NOW BECAUSE THIS IS WHEN THE END OF THE DAY COMES, AND WE'VE STILL GOT PEOPLE UP HIGH, AND THEY NEED TO GET DOWN. Narrator: FAR BELOW, MARK, TIM, AND TEAM 2 CAN SEE THE CROWD BUILDING AT THE TOP OF THE SECOND STEP. IT SHOULD ONLY TAKE 10 MINUTES A PERSON -- AT THE MAXIMUM. I FEEL REALLY SORRY FOR BILL AND THE GUYS UP THERE, HAVING TO STAND THERE AND WAIT AND WAIT AND WAIT AND WAIT -- GETTING COLD, GETTING LOW ON O's. YOU KNOW, TIME IS TICKING BY. Russell: RIGHT NOW, IT'S THE WORST PART OF THE DAY. WE'VE HAD A BIG DELAY AT THE TOP OF THE SECOND STEP. I AM WORRIED ABOUT THESE GUYS -- THEM RUNNING OUT OF OXYGEN. Narrator: TERRY IS STOPPED ONCE AGAIN AT THE SECOND STEP. RUSSELL'S OUT OF OPTIONS. CALLING A RETREAT DURING TERRY'S ASCENT WAS ALWAYS POSSIBLE, BUT BLOCKED ON THE WAY DOWN, RUSSELL IS HELPLESS. TERRY AND HIS TEAM ARE STUCK, WITH NO PLACE TO GO, AND THEIR OXYGEN IS HEADED FOR EMPTY. NEXT TIME... BIG TIM MEDVETZ, DOUBLE AMPUTEE MARK INGLIS, AND LEBANESE ADVENTURER MAX CHAYA FOLLOW IN TERRY'S FOOTSTEPS AND MAKE THEIR SUMMIT BID. IT'S GOING UP! Narrator: FIVE MILES HIGH, IN THE DEATH ZONE, THE TEAM IS IN DESPERATE DANGER WHEN TEMPERATURES PLUMMET TO MINUS 40, AND DETERMINATION TURNS TO MUTINY... COME BACK DOWN NOW. I DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE. Narrator: ...AS SUMMIT FEVER TAKES HOLD. I GOT PLENTY OF OXYGEN TO GET ME UP AND BACK. TURN AROUND RIGHT NOW [BLEEP] DAMN IT.
