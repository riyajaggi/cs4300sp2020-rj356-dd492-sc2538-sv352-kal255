The serious development in the financial sector...

 with Leipzig's Mayor, Peter Schultheiss, sudden disappearance. The politician disappeared without a trace the night of Friday. It's gone. Why? What? Why, Jana? Do you hear! Dear fellow citizens, here's an important message from the government. Don't be scared of the exaggerations in the media. Leave your money in the bank. Your money is safe. Luxembourg, Eight Weeks Earlier Are you already awake, Flo? Did you sleep well? Do you want sweet or healthy? Sweet! I also want something sweet.

 No. That's enough. Now behave properly. Thank you. Is it enough? Do you want milk? Yes please. Deutsche Global Invest, Frankfurt Am Main I heard two of you talk out in the hallway. One said, "Forget your privacy". "Fenger makes sure you have nothing". You damn right I will! You are our first choice! Don't forget that! You can make things happen. This bank will expand investment banking in Frankfurt... and have a madman like me to lead it. That's his fault. I know you belong to the dreaded generation Y. You seek work-life balance... and ask if your job fits your new shoes. Nice shoes! I love them, but now we are wearing sleeves! Adam Pohl! Your P&L; was almost 5.0 last year? 4.8. Very nice, but you can get better. Be hungry, aggressive and ambitious. Let it come from the heart! The frustration since 2008 makes it seem like the party is over. As if we were struggling for small profits and dissatisfied customers. And 10 years after the crisis, we still dare not... mention our profession on a first date. That frustration is shared by all generations. I feel the same. I will do everything I can to make the bank here a global player. But I need you, your courage, your thoughts and your visions! Are you with? You also? And you? What about you? Are you with me? Now the ball rolls. Now we do it! Come on, friends! Development in the European financial sector in recent days... has offered many surprises. Gabriel Fenger is the new investment manager at Deutsche Global Invest. He will manage the bank's exchange rate. Fenger is known in the industry as an aggressive daredevil. I checked your mail. I need a copy for Madame Leblanc. See you at 12:00 o'clock. Good day. Do you speak French? German? English? I'm German. There's a little chaos here. Liekam? And you gotta get my son? I'm pleased, Mr.Jacoby. Get him at this address. Don't say anything to anyone. Okay. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Have a nice day. From banker to cleaning man. You stink. Do I stink? Your bastard! Good morning, Luc. Coffee? I've been through what we talked about yesterday. Do you think we should mention the company structure? Leave me alone. We have 2 hours to Brussels and I'm going to sleep. Luc, that's important... Thank you my friend. The market is full of disaster bonds. Yes, but the other disaster bonds are... Excuse me. A piece of Belgian chocolate? It's exquisite. I believe so. The other disaster bonds are based on the old standard... while ours is based on the new one. Do you understand? Customization sold as a renewal? What is there to imagine, Luc? Your bank only offers me a time waste. The biggest improvement lies in the investor chain... which reduces the tax burden to 35%. 35% is not unusually small. Now let's forget... How much would be enough for you to sign? 30%? 30% would be helpful. There's one thing in the chain that I can investigate. 30%...then we agree. May I explain, Luc? He didn't even read the papers. We already have 30%. He bought it on the spot! Well done, baby. You are the best overpaid assistant who has ever annoyed me. I've spent months on this... If you want to be praised, then become a nurse. But they earn less. You can take the train. I'll call. Asshole! I take the train. You give me a nausea. Lisa? Can you book a train ticket from Brussels to Luxembourg? No, it's just for me. Thanks. The coffee. I'm waiting for you. Bloody hell! Jana Liekam? Are you coming with us? Why? Don't worry. I explain it all. What happened? I know who you are. Don't worry. No, stay here... This road, thank you. They can leave your stuff here. No...fine. Come with me. Thanks. Hello? Definitely. I'll do that right away. I'll fix it. Jana! Don't worry. Madame! Jana! I ask you! No! Jana! Stop! What happened? Stop! You don't know who I'm, but why was I fired? Just give us 5 minutes. You are Jana Liekam from structuring. You work for Luc Jacoby. Did Luc say anything...? Be quiet. It's me, Philippe. Jana Liekam is here with me because she has been fired. Do you know anything about it? Thanks. You worked with the California Catastrophe product. The most important customer is Gotthard insurance in Berlin. They have withdrawn their offer. You gave them wrong numbers. It was Jacoby who spoke to them and sent them the numbers. Does he claim that I gave them wrong numbers? Don't be so naive, Jana. You understand exactly what's going on. What did you do wrong? Did you get him on the nerves? Or were you so stupid that you looked better than him? I'm constantly looking for new talent, but what a joy I have from a... who steals the limelight from a board member's son? Okay, I accept the rules of the game. I'm sorry for Luc... and will correct the mistake with Gotthard. I'm sorry, Jana. They...excuse me. They have seen me do Luc's work for months... and now I'm fired because of him? If you want, we can talk about it tonight. Not a word to anyone. KL. 21st. Now leave with a composure. No tears. Are you with me, Jana? No tears. I had been fired. I panicked! Take it easy. Relax. What do you see in front of you? I...see my hand. Well. Move it. What more can you see? The steering wheel. I cannot breathe! Deep breaths. What does it say? How many kilometers has it run? How many kilometers, honey? 13,459. Well. How much money do you have in the bank? €160,000. How long can you live on it? How long can you live on it? A year, maybe. In the worst case, how long can you survive? Honey? Four years. Four years. You have nothing but money. Something far more important. What can it be? I have you. It's just a job. Just a fucking job. Jana Liekam. Good evening. This is Tilo Peters from WWK's HR department. I have heard what happened and have good news for you. I work for Deutsche Global Invest in Frankfurt. Gabriel Fenger would like to meet you tomorrow. Do you have time? Yes? Is your mother home? It's for you. Hey. Why does Luc succeed? He comes from a wealthy family. He has a good network, is well educated and confident. Why does Jana succeed? Because I'm skilled. I have struggled to achieve what people like Luc are born into. And therefore you are not so naive that you think that is enough. Do you want to make a career? Of course. Why? It's surprising how a simple "why" makes people mock. Have you no idea why I want to help you? When they came into my office this morning... You learned something important. There's no loyalty. Not to your colleagues and not to your bank. I advised Global about you because I want you to work there. For one or two years, maybe. Then I get you home to Crédit International. Your next lesson is that your career... not determined by your bank, but by your network. I'm part of your network from now on, if you want. Did it sound scary? Call if you need help, no matter what. Maybe I also need a service on a wonderful day. They don't work for your boss... Your colleagues or the bank, but for yourself. I'm going to a job interview in Frankfurt tomorrow. This applies to a position in Gabriel Fenger's new investment department. "Deutsche Global Invest. We invest in visions". I can start there and at the same time seek work in Luxembourg. Are you happy? It's Global! Thanks. Jana Liekam? Hi, my name is Basha. It's for you. Did the journey go well? Yes please. Good morning. 12.30. Come on time. Miserable idiot. Just sit down again. Jana Liekam. I know. Sit down. What is the name of the asshole? Luc Jacoby? His father sits on CI's board. Ties Jacoby. Do you know him? I have seen him. Another asshole. Let's see...Jana Liekam. Do you have no children? My boyfriend has a daughter. They were second best in your vintage at LSF. Unusual for a woman. I know. I don't know if you fit in here. I need people who can close. One who works for me is not afraid of the limelight. And certainly not for an asshole like Luc Jacoby. I wasn't afraid. I had to assist him. Do you think you are better at structuring products? Yes, definitely. Okay. They worked most recently on the California disaster bonds. We have a similar product, which unfortunately has not come so far. They must clone your product here and sell it before CI. They must steal Luc Jacoby's customers and close the deal. For us, for Global. If you can do that, you are employed. I need a team. How many mandarins are there for this room? Furnished or unfurnished? Fine. I appreciate people who are self-made... but they often fail because they lack confidence. Prove that I'm wrong and put an end to that asshole. Okay. Can we tell you each other? Yes. You...excellent. You. Out! Yes, this year. August 7th. Come on, folks! Hi, We haven't met each other. Thao. What was your name now? Adam Pohl. 4.8. Adam and Thao. Your project with disaster bonds... You get a new colleague. Jana Liekam. She is sitting there looking at what you have. Okay? Jana Liekam. Adam Pohl. Shantimay, mathematician. Fenger. Can we speak German? I understand, but don't speak. Good luck with that. The grammar is wonderful. Where's the Asian girl? Hey. I'm Thao. Nice to meet you. I would suggest some changes... which are better adapted to the requirements of the insurance companies. We must increase the areas of interest. My product at CI was better. In what way? It's tax-optimized. I can also do that here, but we need a stronger product. What else do you need? A tax lawyer. We'll start tomorrow. We'll find an apartment for you. We probably have one that's empty. Come on! Thao. If you have problems with something, look with the language. Why should I have it? Well. That's the way it's supposed to sound. Oh boy! See my view. Over there, Global is located. But you can't see that. Fantastic! Here is the kitchen. Can you see it? Closing! Closing! Can you explain what "Closing" means? If I manage to close, I'll be back home soon. You don't need to know more. I work in an investment bank. Structured financing. Do you understand? We make structured finance products. It's very complex. Everything is based on certain basic elements such as shares or commodities. One can bundle a package for a specific purpose... which can then be converted into a share package. You can use mathematical models. There are weather derivatives. One speculates in the temperature. I have a super product that is wondering... that California is not hit by a natural disaster now. We need to look into the permitted tax places. I have to take advantage of the fact that I worked with it at CI in Luxembourg. It was rubbish. Cayman Islands? It would benefit US investors and us... Luc's clientèle is particularly weak in the US. You work on a product for months... and trying to make something really profitable. Then you go to the customers, all of whom will all increase their fortunes. You have institutions, pension funds, insurance companies, banks... but also individuals, investment-strong individuals. Rich ass holes that will be even richer. The risk model is solid. It must be better. You made a successful earthquake test in Mexico. Do you want to use the same method on data from California? You don't have to understand everything. Only the bank's mathematicians do. These are the ones who have developed the model...please. We just need the information. That's why I read everything. I'm the one in the bank who reads the fastest. And yet you stand here. Due to 2 grams of pot. There's more to it. Since A customer. Jana sell she same as you. I have to run. Taxi! Do you have the levels, Thao? Five minutes. Jana developed the product and will try to improve it. The question is what we do? Brainstorming. I'm going through everything. It's well. But everything needs to be updated. New values! I must be able to tell the customer that everything is much better than before. I have to come before that bitch. We have just heard that Sacramento has been hit by two earthquakes. California Governor has declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles. How did CI's statistics look? 5 on the Richter scale. If it's higher than that, his numbers no longer hold. Epicenter was located 160 km northeast of San Francisco... and measured 5.6 on the Richter scale. Yes! Yes! Let me be your Sherpa! Such! Yes, a fucking earthquake! Over 5! Now you need to compile a new statistic. We need to call all customers and send them a new index. Yes, it puts us back several days, so get started! I've gone through everything, Peter. Someone has to do it and I thought about you because you are my friend. Peter? We are talking about €6 billion, of which only 2 are financed. It has been a construction stop. Without it, there will be one big cemetery. Leipzig is the country's most desolate city... Who says that? It's in the newspaper. I can give you the numbers. What numbers? What happened to you? You were such a fighter! Not Hamburg? Not Berlin? Stuttgart is also well on its way now. No, Leipzig! It's always Leipzig! Poor at! I don't want to listen to that shit anymore! We ignore this. I agree to a refinancing. Do you mean it? It may be best for all of us. It's...thank you. It's a lie! He steals one customer after another. Thanks. Luc lacks only five customers to be able to close. Damn. How can he be so fast? Network, luck, good in bed, what do I know? That makes our meeting even more important. Thanks, that's fine. Where did we come from? Well, our safety margin is higher than that of our competitors... which the earthquake showed. Our product had done it. So the 40% tax exemption is just the icing on the cake. They are constantly talking about it. The tax advantage is huge. Okay. This... Would you just take a look? It sounds great. But I have to be on the safe side and talk to the tax authorities. Absolutely, Catherine. Take all the time you need. Do they have any questions? No. Want to taste? No thanks. I know we... Not us. You. You raised the tax question. Yes, it's still a big plus. What is a plus for the customer, I decide. Adam takes care of the customer. You keep low profile. Yes? What a surprise, what? What? Does it hurt much? That's how it goes for a deadly maid to be put in place. So what? No reaction? Can't you even do that? Where could you think you could go up against me? You can't do anything. You will never be anything. You're nothing but shit. This is my private number. Never call my work number. No one needs to know that we have contact. Pardon. Do you need help with Luc? I need to be faster than him, or I won't get the job done. How can I help? If you could slow him down a little when I closed the deal. Should I sabotage my own bank, Jana? They can do better. Good luck. Damn. The Danish FSA asks for our control mechanisms. Do all authorities have to keep an eye on us? Next week, thank you. I cannot. Not that? I have a cat bond! I'm a seller. Are there no others who can take care of it? They have created the problem and must now solve it. Is that understood? Hello? What a surprise, Jana. Do you remember me? How could I forget you? I want to ask you for a favor. Tell me, is Jana closing? By closing?! No then. With which customers? Gotthard, for example. I'm going to the restroom. Excuse me for coming so late. I just wanted to say I've done it. I'm just going to Gotthard in Berlin, our biggest customer. I have to convince him, but that's no problem. I know him. What's wrong? Nothing. Everything is good. I drive to Berlin, meet Gotthard, and then we are in port. Then the little shirt can...I win. I always win. Luc Manipulated Climbing. We Have To Repeat Now. Luise. I always win, Christelle. Go with you. Nice trip. Let's drive. And we are off! Damn! It's an earthquake in the water. Then their index goes up to 7. The fucking Luc is on his way to his last customer, Gotthard. Almost. Okay...Adam, I need your help. You must send an email to Sievert at Gotthard in ten minutes. Now I have to tell you what we do. What are you doing here? Well, is he already on his way? Then I'm too late. I want to hear what he has to say. Do it. They were colleagues, didn't they? Well, I worked for Luc on CI. In fact with this particular product. It was me who integrated the cash sweep improvement. What? Cash sweep improvement. I don't know what is. It's crucial for the product. But Luc can explain that. I don't have a chance against him. I'm too late and it doesn't help to break away now. That sounds interesting. Have a good day. You too. Goodbye. Fenger will talk to you. I'm otherwise critical of this kind of... but here you have a really good and solid BBB. And besides... The risk of... The risk spreading is tailored to your needs. We know each other. I trust you. We already made business when Liekam went to kindergarten. Hey. Sit. Sometimes you climb quickly, sometimes slower. I must let you go. But don't despair now? If you had won over Luc, I would have offered you something right away. This cash sweep improvement that you integrated into the product... sounds very trendy. What is it about? Cash sweep improvement is... incredibly important... in the end...after all... Should I get a glass of water? Okay, okay. I did not compete against Luc, but against myself. I developed the product at CI and here. You are better, smarter and more competent, but... Luc gets the trophies home. But... No one has said that life is fair, so don't whine. In the end, it's about who wins. Sorry, but I have something to tell. All Luc's clients go over to us. Also Gotthard. Luc must have done something wrong. CI calls their product back. What is cash sweep improvement for something, Jana? I just found that. Say what you want. Okay. Welcome to our team. Welcome to Circus Gaga. Well done. Get off! Deutsche Rück will participate in our disaster bonds. Now we sell the shit. Well done! Sir. Jacoby? It's the Police. I haven't called you. Turn around against the car. You are suspected of fraud. Stand still, otherwise it can hurt. Also this one. And this one. What happened? I also probably wished to know. Mrs. Leblanc, we tried to contact you before Luc arrived. I saw it too late, but we responded immediately. I don't tolerate that. It will never happen again. It's a true Lydian coin. The first money in the world. 600 BC... At that time the value was the same as the gold the coin consisted of. Later it was enough with a piece of paper with numbers on. And today we believe in our financial App on the mobile phone... when it claims we are richer than yesterday. We then have to drag around gold. A single figure is really wonderful. It has different meanings for different people. Prosperity. Status. Recognition. Dependence. Adrenalin. Greed. It's really good news! Life. Sky! Everyone has something that drives them. A number they will constantly increase. As they are willing to do everything. Great news. Police have arrested Luc Jacoby. I need more information about Jana Liekam. All. Family, girlfriend, everything you find. At Global. Yes, she trusts me, but that's not enough. And you? Why are you doing this? Jana Liekam! Cat bond girls! Bond girl! Here we have her! Bond girl! Hey. I closed the deal. Seriously? Yes, it was totally crazy. Fenger would fire me. But then the phone rang. Luc had watched it. Jana won. When will you be home? Soon, Flo. You, I talked to the headhunter I told you about. I'll tell him. Just a moment. Noah, I have to run. I'll call you back later. Hey. Good evening. What do they want? Talk about your future. About our future cooperation. After what you have proven in recent weeks... I think we should think bigger. Bigger?
