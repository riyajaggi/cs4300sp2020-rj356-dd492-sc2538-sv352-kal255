 Come on! Yes! Yes! How do you handle rumors? We like to believe those rumors that we hope are true. So I was thinking... You're thinking about how to make me believe in a rumor. The Secret Service taught me when to be quiet. And when not to. You also learned to secretly meet people and to devise a plot. The figures you were given by the Global executives are fake.

 We had accountants and auditors there. A friend in the Secret Service told me that the German Financial Supervisory Authority is investigating Global's illegal activities due to the forged balances you were given. Isn't that the kind of rumor you'd love to be true? Do you have proof? So it's not worth investigating? Christalle, accept it. Luc. Can you send me the Leipzig run? Soon. We're closing in seven days. Yes. Call our agents within the hour.

 Luc. €20 millions is gone. Luc? Mike, I need information from you. Why is there a red line here? I've always wondered what it must be like to be the warden. You're the ones playing. We're the ones watching the children play. You make it impossible for me to do my job. What did you even do that's forcing me to waste my time babysitting you? You must talk to Luc. Something is wrong. Luc, what's wrong? What are you doing? I'm thinking. I know how fast you usually are. I'm thinking. We have 7 days. I don't know if we can make it. Maybe there's a smarter strategy. Is he making fun of us? He has his moments. We need Adam. He's faster and better. Thao, I don't know if Fenger will get him back. Convince him. We need Adam. Do you have his address? I do. Did you know that frees communicate with each other? Via the ground with biochemical signals. For example, they warn each other of natural enemies. Luc and you have completely different clients. You'd complement each other perfectly. If I talk to Fenger again... I worked with a man in a bank for a while. He was a great salesperson. Damn, he was good! He always upstaged me. So I started to pretend to be his best friend. I partied with him, but deep down, I hated him because he was better than me. We had a female colleague. At some point, she'd come to work wearing a hat and got pale. She had cancer. Eventually, she disappeared. Do you know what I thought? It's too bad he doesn't have cancer. That would solve it all. He has cancer. Would leave. He'd die. I don't cure, as long as I'm number one. I couldn't get rid of this wish of him having cancer. But he didn't. He quit, became a filthy rich Hedge Fund Manager and a week ago, he made sure that my... wife would leave me. And you have me swallow chili without considering the consequences. Why are we this way? Nothing about nature is peaceful. Even the finest of Bacillus kills all it touches. Animals only communicate to save themselves. Nature is the most anti-social system there is. It makes Capitalism appear as welfare. Adam, stop fighting and accept who you are. We've both made mistakes. I'm not going back to the bank. That's over. No signal. I have to leave after this. When will we talk? May I have my mobile phone back? When will we talk? May I have my phone? I'm off tomorrow, and then we're going to talk. If I can have my phone back. Promise? I promise. I promise. How are you today? I'm fine. Adam is such on idiot. What do we do now? Okay, Luc. What's wrong? Why do you do this job, Jana? Please stop this nonsense and tell me what's wrong. Who benefits from us working ourselves to death? Luc, don't wear me out. What's wrong? 10 minutes in the ladies restroom, okay? Hello. Hello. You allow them to humiliate you like this, with that guard who follows you? What's up? We're being fired. My father told me. Right offer closing, we're all gone. You, me, and also Thao. The entire Leipzig team. The bosses agreed on i1. Are you surprised by now? No. Why bother? Will we give these bastards what they want? No! No. Nonsense. Why would you do something your father doesn't expect? Luc, you're a typical rich kid. Always complaining about depending on your family, but when it matters, you don't have the courage to drop them. Are you done? You could care less about them. You could close here, rehabilitating yourself. You could start at Lindberg & Stern, Goldman, wherever. But, no! Deep down, little Luc wants to get back into his father's lap. Because it's so comfortable there. And if you're complaining, that's more convenient too. Why else would you pretend not to have a choice? I'm going back now to do my job. Do you have any plans offer work with your insignificant life? No, you don't. Cake, anyone? Where are we? Things are well now that Luc is back. Okay. I won't be back until tomorrow. Okay... Bye. See you tomorrow. This has to stop. Not twice a week... Look. Left everything out. You can't do this. She eats more than I do. Only twice a day... No. Come on. You can't be serious. You can't just... You even allow her to have biscuits before bed? Seriously? Okay. Do you ever give her vegetables? Hi! Jana, what are you doing here? It doesn't matter. I have to leave again. Will you be here tomorrow? I just came to say goodbye. When will you be back? I brought this for you. You like them, don't you? Don't cry. I love you. Lie down again. Promise to get back to sleep. Okay. Sleep well. Close your eyes. Bye. I'm not used to this silence. At least, you can find out what it is you won't. Some things make sense then. I'm going to jog for half on hour and will leave you alone. You find out if you truly want this. Adam. Jana. If this gets out, we're going to prison. Let's not waste time. What is... a dragon slayer? A dragon slayer? What magazine is this, Flo? From Jana. Jana gave you this magazine? She dreamt it. I did not. Jana wasn't even here yesterday. How should she have... When you were in the bath. In the bath? Yes. Jana was here yesterday, when we were in the bath. What do we do if we run into someone? Then I'm helping with a client in London. Peter Richard German Financial Supervisory Authority Quirin, Mr.Richard has been causing trouble all morning. Don't you want to answer? Cappuccino? Good morning, Mr.Richard. Likewise. Mr.Sydow, I've asked your colleague Mr.Schwartz for an itemized list and evidence for all Silver Mountain transactions. I'd like more detailed information on your business relationship. Didn't Mr.Schwartz include that? No, it's missing. I'm sorry. I will hand it in later. Okay. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hello, Felix. Are you my escort? We paid your call-boy. He will be available to you for the next 3 hours. We all realize just how criminal this is. We do. Okay. So. I will use multiple channels to bid on Global's steep collapse. I will position myself for one week with shares, CDS and so on. Jana will then leak the evidence. Global shares will full, and we will benefit. You just keep working at Global as always. I will make sure the market will remain unaware. Your evidence is crazy. You should be about to close, which is then guaranteed to fall through. I'd expect Global to drop by 20%. So my fund should gain €40 to €60 million, 20% of which is mine. In the end, we will have a profit of roughly €8 to €12 million. How do we share it? I have the biggest risk. I have no guarantee you will actually leak the evidence. I will give you 15%. Ok. 20%. Okay. This upcoming week, you will give it your all, and then... we will fuck the Global. Luc. This is the last time I'm leaving a voice-mail for you. I promise. Maybe you will call me back. So. Bun Cha. As always without lemon-grass, no carrots, extra papaya. Enjoy... Mr.Richard! How nice of you to make time for me. Thank you. I wasn't even at the office. This is my domain. This is my passion and my downfall. This is my old love, and this could be my new one. They gave it to me to test-drive it. What do you think? The new one is better. Is it? Do you have the Silver Mountain files? I just test-drove it. Just wonderful. This engine runs like a young race horse. But... I'm loyal. Would you like to sit in it? Come on. Please. Make my day. Come on. Help me make this decision. It's funny. Nice seats. Just take it for a spin. It has GPS. I still have to tune the exhausts. Mr.Sydow, I wanted to ask you... Victoria from Strasbourg. This is Mr.Richard. Sit next to him. Go for a drive with him, so he won't steal the car. Hello, I'm Vicky. Take your time. She knows the area. If you return the car without scratches, I will let you drive it more often. I will buckle you in. Not like this! Another time. Let's discuss Silver Mountain. We've been working day and night to guarantee and maintain this country's stability. Who put that idea info your head? This thing costs over €1,000. The price doesn't mutter. This is insane. It does everything. It can fry, stew, cook, stir... And this is your gift to me? Yes, That's what I had planned. You said, "Use your money to make others happy". I just want to make you happy. If it doesn't make you happy, we will toss it. Out the window? No! I will give it to this friendly neighbor. The one who always greets us in the hall. Shower first. Will you join me? Soon. - Join me? - Soon. Yes, really? Soon. See you soon. Okay. See you soon. I didn't mean to startle you. What are you doing here? I must ask you something. I've had a long day and I'm fired. You can't just show up here. I will make it quick. I just want to ask you to tell me what you were doing in the data center. I don't know what you're talking about. You're in touch with the Supervisory Authority. I don't know what you're afraid of. I've never been in touch with The Supervisory Authority. I don't believe you. Please. I don't know... Stop lying! I've made a mistake. I wanted to control it... I...oh God...when I... My mother...I wanted to... I was certain there was an error in the Cat Bond. I wanted to correct it. I've asked Mohamed to grant me access, because I was sure of it. I wanted to correct it. I only did it because I have a problem. Please. I didn't want any of this. I was sure there was an error. They called, but I was still a child and they... They wanted... I used the wrong figures because of the medication... What medication? For my mother. They called and I gave them the wrong figures. I have to get this under control. I keep thinking I've mode a mistake. I didn't mean for... I can't do this anymore! I'm sorry... They called. The ambulance didn't arrive in time, because I didn't have the correct... She would have had a few more months. Calm down. Calm down. Your burger. Enjoy. Thank you. Please listen! We... did it! A week ago, we were scared, and now we finished early. Nineteen hours early, Gabi. Now we just have to wait for the closing tomorrow at 11:00. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you! Now! Now! Mr.Schultheiss? Ms.Liekum, I must thank you and congratulate you. This is insane. Thank you. No, really. You're the only one who knows what this means to me. Thank you again. You're welcome. In all honesty, how old are you? - 25. - That's crazy. Ms.Liekam, Mr.Fenger spoke very highly of you. Did he? Yes, he did. And rightly so. I'd like to join in on this praise. You're wonderful. On that note, Ms.Liekam, I'd like to thank you again and to say goodbye. Goodbye, Mr.Schulfheiss. Goodbye, Ms.Liekam. How will you defend me? How will you prevent me from being fired? Gabriel, I alone closed one of the biggest deals this bank has had in years. And now I'm being fired? Because my boss is a coward? What you did is industrial espionage. Can I trust you? Tell me! You don't think I'm a spy. You're just too weak to defend me to the executives. Let's be honest for a second. It's really quite simple. The two of us, we have talent. No matter how terrible the situation is, we adapt to it. We do what we have to in order to advance. Whatever you've done, whatever Leblanc wanted you to do, you did it to advance. You've adapted. Which is what you're doing now. We were a very good team. I'm sorry. Okay. No, it's not okay. Our careers are at stake. It's nothing personal. And neither is what's going to happen in the future. I'm going to go down to Human Resources to quit. What do you mean "In the future"? Do you already have a plan? I'm going to adapt. Gabriel. Accounting fraud Deutsche Bank Global Invest Luc! What's wrong? I... What's up? Wait a second. What? You and I, this isn't working. What do you mean? I can't fell you to your face, but... I don't want to be with you anymore. Not be with me anymore? But this was so nice, so un-complicated. I don't understand your world. I don't want to be a part of it. But I also don't want to force you into a life that doesn't suit you. Let's talk inside. I think... you're not a man I can love. I'm... very bad at this. I'm sorry. I'm going to hang up. Thank you, let's talk inside. Please let's talk inside. Gruzi! Grazynu, don't... Let's talk! You can't just... See you in 30 minutes of "Game". Are you okay? Yes, I am. Great. Where are you going to meet? Around the corner. It's called "The Game". The Game? You seem different. Well. You know, I realized something. I realized that others ore always controlling my life. I've changed that. I've for something for you. From Flo. I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you! Let him go! Let him go! Let him go. Let him go. Calm down. Hello, Christalle. Do you know what's going on at Global? No, why? Felix Bender is betting against Global, and the others are following suit. Something's wrong. I'm sorry, but I don'? know. Okay. You might have known. Have a good night. Thank you. My mobile phone is gone, too. Who did this? Leaked evidence proves: Deutsche Global Invest is bankrupt Forging the balance sheet by billions Turn on your TV. Financial expert Mathias Ringe comments on Twitter... Be quiet, please! As if they'd only been waiting for the last nail for the coffin. That's how quickly the markets reacted to the publication of evidence which was meant to prove that Deutsche Global Invest sold junk papers worth billions to itself. What does this evidence mean? This might be another banking crisis. All of mine are dropping Leipzig. If the government keeps it's promise and doesn't save Deutsche Global Invest with fax funds, a domino effect is about to happen, as the banks can't save themselves. The only fear we have now is a bank run. It makes sense that you're noting that our money is sate. It is. Up to €100,000. But what if my bank account has €150,000? Will I lose €50,000? It's this very kind of fear-mongering that's dangerous. It is an unusually strong reaction we're witnessing. The market's determined reaction allows us to conclude that it was counting on the bank's bankruptcy, as no one is waiting for an official statement or denial. No one wants to be the hast to Turn off the fights. So the markets are trying to anticipate such a development, which, in turn, will cause a downwards spiral...
