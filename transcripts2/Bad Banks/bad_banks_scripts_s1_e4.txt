Bu? you will And me. Rule number one, it won't come out if no one benefits from it. We will stir the poi. In Global's accounting. If they find out Jana snooped around they will fire her. But, if she hands you the evidence... She will. I will offer her the right job. Thank you. I wish to set soil and leave everything behind. It's a phase. Everyone has those. In a crisis one questions everything. If if makes sense. Do you have an answer? There is no answer. Accept that. There are two options, you either crash or return 'to your old life and fry to be happy. There are only two options in life? When you started working many years 090, your father was so rich you didn't need to work. Want me to disinherit you? His standard threat. What about you? Are your parents rich? Should Luc be poor? To be content? What to use our money for? Don't answer. It's is just rhetorical. Why not? She has an impact on you. A positive one. Splendid. I know many people who only cure about affording things. There is nothing more depressive than money saved on accounts not doing who? if should, make people happy- Here is the reason for our meeting. Our attorney did if, you may work again. Stop the charade and be yourself. You had fun with the maid. Time to grow up. She understands French? How would I know? Come with me. Where are we going? What's this? In the 80's this was called the Iceberg Storey. Cocaine was stored here. Only a few know that. Have a seat. Sorry, I don't have a sofa. Why are you showing me this? Because... I live here. This is me. Okay. I won't 'to show you how you could end up. Thanks for the warning. I have a boyfriend. Of course. I expected you to be more charming. I'm better at other things. What happened to the smart banker I remind you of? Cur accident. Long time ago. Shit. Good night. No. Yes. I was thinking here. Why here? The cultural center will be built here. Hyphenated? Peter-Schultheiss-Sirclsse? No idea. The street is shorter than ifs name. Schuliheiss Strusse... If makes sense. Without me the street wouldn't exist. Schulfheiss Sfrasse. No hyphen. Hello. Good morning. When are you coming home? Soon. Very soon. When is that? Very very soon. I miss you. I miss you, too. I miss you. It's no? true. He is lying. Shh... He said "shh". He is lying. Yes, we miss you very much. Are you saying I'm Wing? No outsider would suspect anything. He asked if Silver Mountain was part of Global. I have been careful. My employees don't suspect anything. Who has information on Silver Mountain? Good day. Hove u semi. I want the names of everyone in this building who is suspicious 'to you. What are you looking for? Don't waste my time. I won't. If you're covering someone... I'm not. Then you cure in if, too. Security is about to confiscate your mobile. And your computer. You can't do that. You are hiding something. It's obvious. You may either confess now or your career is over. Alright then... Twice I had someone... Twice someone asked me questions. Jana Liekam. She wanted to know more about sold projects. And download something for Fenger. From the data center. Which projects? I think...Quaestus. Fuck. This is now' on empty threat. Closing will not be postponed. I expect your bank to fake over the unsold amount info ifs passbook. To meet the deadline. Closing must not be postponed. On the roof. Now. If if is postponed the city will go to court. Thank you for your openness, Mr. Schuliheiss. We will make if happen. Good-bye. I won't argue with you. She snooped around. Nonsense. I wish 'three lawyers giving her hell. What would they do? Threaten her not to folk about something she doesn't even know? Jana is my most important employee. Look of this. Isn't this strange? The similarity? Leo was a loose cannon, too. Drop it. She was. But... she was more ruthless and cooler than us. She was one step ahead. That's why we loved and adored her. Bu? this chick Jana... You loved her because she was mine. Whatever. I see 'the similarities. We won't fake any risk. It's in both our interests. That's why you waited with the transactions until my first day? On my first day the soles to Silver Mountain were ready. You waited to suck me in. Thai is correct. I waited for you to be involved so I could fire her. Because I envy your success. Okay. I will fake cure of Jana. Do it. Or others will. Come with me. Now! What did you fry to download? Answer me. Okay. I didn't download anything. I had CI drink with colleagues. They mentioned a project. I wanted to know more. H's normal when you are new. Which project? I don't remember. If was Quaestus. What did you download? I wanted... Stop lying. Why Quaestus? Lei me finish. You are lying. I didn't download anything. I read up on something. You won't ever find a job again. You have only one chance. You have to be honest, and I have 'to believe you. Start talking. Come on. Someone asked me for i1. Who? I didn't fell them anything. Who? Christalle Leblanc. She asked me about Quaestus and to check it. But I didn't do it. I cut all fies with her. Why did she ask for if? I don't know. If seemed suspicious so I didn't do it. Fucking asshole. They cure investigating . You will not be left unsupervised anymore. I didn't do anything. What? Gabriel? She wanted it because Cl and Global are merging. I know you and Khuno prefer Fenger. Christelle. You know how much I appreciate your work. We all have strategies. It took me u while 'to understand yours. Most bank presidents are alpha mules. You are not. You always come second. Even though you are the boss. Bu? you accept it. You make if a virtue. We should finish supper. You didn't notice the compliment. I admire you. You excel at forming your partners so they won'? threaten you. I like your passive aggressiveness. The hidden insults that prevent a vocal fight. I'm disappointed that you assume I prefer Fenger. There's a reason. You are scared of me. I'm kidding. You have decided. Mrs. Liekam? My name is Meissner. From compliance. I will watch you. I will always be near you. This is awkward for me, too. Okay. I have to excuse myself. No problem. Juno? Can you talk? Yes, what's up? They know I snooped around. I'm under surveillance. This guy follows my every move. Shit. Come to Luxembourg and we'll talk. Okay. I have three children. I can't risk this job. I'm sorry. You couldn't worn me? We were friends. You didn't'? care. You didn't'? care. I do cure, but... They sot there... and I...Jana, please. Lug? Jana, I would like to talk to you. Can I come up? I will come downstairs. Okay- It's weird to have this much time. I was overwhelmed at first. I believe you needed it. You can't imagine how sorry I am for treating you that way. Of course. You know better now and fry to be o better person. If sounds odd, but it's true. You are the biggest asshole I have ever met. You had me do the dirty work while humiliating me. I know. Instead of you I was fired. Pretending to be u better person is suspicious. H's for your own good. If only serves your narcissism. You are right. Anything else? I had nothing to do with your dismissal. Yeah. Your dud saved you, and you didn't notice. Human resources demanded your dismissal due to mistakes... that you made. Your dud projected you by firing me. It's alright I got it. My father went to New York that' day. Big Daddy was on Cl plane. He wasn't involved. And me, neither. Juno? "220111 European Bunker of the Year Christelle Leblanc "is awarded the Awareness Prize..." Isabelle. Could you read if normally? "In the lute 90's Christalle Leblanc "went after business criminals "while cut the French external intelligence agency DGSE. "She promotes sustainable financial projects "to regain the customer's trust in investment banking." Scratch “DGSEK Intelligence always sounds bad. No matter what. The entire passage? Yes. You should check your hearing. Splendid. May I release 'this as is? You had back pain. Unsurprisingly. You sleep on the floor. My goodness, yes... They will come back. They were bad. Do you always eat by yourself? That's sad. I'm not by myself. The entire ECB is here. MT$Mr.Sydow3? Hold on. Excuse me. Richard, from the Financial Supervisory Authority. We haven't me. You are new? Well... If was a surprising change. I'm the new boss in B6. Let's have a meeting. We improve the European supervision mechanism. Together with ECB. Certainly, make an appointment. Very well. There are a few... Anyway- We'll folk then. Enjoy. You, too. See you soon. I will close within a week. Then I will quit this bullshit I will do this... I have to finish this. I will quit before they can fire me. I will come back. I want you and Flo. I wish us to live together. I will get a random job in Luxembourg. I will be cable to with your support. No more Global, no more Cl. I don't won't this anymore. l1 is fucked up. I want you to know that I miss you. I have to finish this. But then I will come buck. Back to you. You fake some stuffing... Then you do this... Who is that? I don't know. I'm Juno Liekum, a former colleague of Luc's. Is he here? Yes, come in. What brings you here? It's about Leipzig 2025. I need you. Wine? It's ready. But we have no time. It's about a huge amount, around €4 billion. I don't want to risk anything. I need a salesman who can sell anything. I need a bull-shitter like you. I didn't just say that. I won't do if anymore. This is one of Europe's most profitable projects. Good for you. We waif for you. Think about it. But not too long. My apologies for interrupting. Cheers. Everything alright? Yes. Be honest. Why do you like Fenger? He is charming. A sense of humor. Does if excuse his crimes? He and Sydow signed the deal on Silver Mountain. They are criminals. Let's talk about you. Do you want buck 'to Cl? Then give me the evidence. You haven't been honest with me. Will that change? Patronizing you was a mistake. So yes. Okay. Who had me fired at Cl? Do you know the Death House? His a building near Cl. In the center. With many offices. Some are Cl offices. People useless to the bank are moved there. People who dedicated their life to the bank, are moved to small, shabby offices. After the merger, when Fenger is the boss, I will be useless. They will send me to that building as a consultant. Where I will vegetate until early retirement. You could quit. You will always find Cl job. You will realize how the system is male-dominated. I had you fired. I was going to contact and offer you a job at Global. But you beat me and came 'to my office. I thought, an ambitious banker who looked similar 'to Fenger's late fiancée could help me collect incriminatory information on him. That's all. That's the truth. Where do you stop? What if I don'? give you the evidence? What's your leverage? Your boyfriend works in private wealth? His clients like him, but he is... average? Not0 genius like you. One call from me and he will never find a client or a job again. That's where I'd start I hope we can remain friends. At school there used to be competition. "Who is best at cheating?" I didn't want to cheat. It's just as stressful and risky to write a cheat sheet as learning for the fest. So I snitched. The 'teacher watched us closely, and everybody was equal again. Our entire conversation is already on my cloud. Why I like Fenger? He doesn't need a cheat sheet. I will ensure he remains my boss. Is she gone? Could you write me a note? I didn't prepare that paper on plant louses. I'm talking to you. Hello? He is average. Not a genius like you. One call from me and he will never find a client or a job again. You can't sleep? Maybe I could work again. With a different attitude. And... that job would have nothing to do with my father. They want me because I'm good. You said you didn't wish to go buck to the bank. Thai they broke you. They will break you again. We are in a hurry. There is no catch. Have your people check it and lei our trader know. Thai works. Excuse me. This is your desk. Thank you. Good morning. Now is our chance. Thank you. I'm buck. The lust two weeks were tough. Nobody spent time 2011 home. But you have to keep going 'to make this happen. Fill the order book. Consult with clients. Everything must run parallel to close in eight days. Luc, can we do this? I can do this. Lei the big dog out Buck to work. Enjoy. Thank you. Hello. The meat is wrong. What's wrong with if? Take a look. It is too small. I would like it remade. You are kidding, right? I would like one like everyone else. Thank you. You have to sort if out quickly for your children. Don't let her talk you info something. Mum, the baby is not even born yet. Chin up. Your brother finally accepted your money. Talk to him, he is here. Toni, Adam is on the phone. I can't think of a better solution for her. You know people who do this. Are you mad? A Iot is at stake for me. I don't care. Don't do it. We manipulate people without them noticing. If if doesn't work... Listen, I won'? pretend I didn't hear that I won't lei you cross u line. I was never here. No!
