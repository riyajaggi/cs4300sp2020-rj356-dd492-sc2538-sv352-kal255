Then we have an equilateral triangle, that you should know about. It has equal sides and equal angles. And this related to the Pythagorean theorem to do: the right angle. It means... Everyone in Sweden know that we live in democracy and freedom of religion. The only problem is that it is a lie spread by the enemies of God. Anyone who says you can be true Muslim and vote politically, lying. Anyone who tells you to obey Swedish law, not sharia is not a Muslim. He is the enemy of Islam, and in Sweden is the true doctrine prohibited. If you go to a mosque to preach the word of God, you are persecuted ... -Jobbar you tonight, Miryam?

I've checked every night. Me too. I did not know how bad it was in Palestine. It's horrible! Thanks for the links you sent. -What did you think? -You are so sick angry.

Why she lets me just do my job? -Have Nadir to do with it? -Yes. Nadir says Sara, Sara to me. He's just trying to punish me now.

Seriously, you have to. -Chilla. Do not say "chilling". If you say it and someone hears, I have to kill you. Why do not you like them? What is wrong? It is not good people. They just hate and hate and hate. They thanked God when that magazine in Paris was attacked. -Charlie Hebdo. What is it, then? What? I think they're heroes. That magazine desecrated Islam.
