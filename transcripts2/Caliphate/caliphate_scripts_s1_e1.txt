"We are offering a salsa cruise including free drinks. " "You can throw the sticks." You bastards! - Were they the last? -Yeah. No, leave it there. I need to talk with you. Okay ... What happened? I got a phone call yesterday- - from Pervin, one of my old girls from Järvagårdsskolan. I haven't heard from her since she left for Syria. - To IS? -Yes. And that is terrible. She lives down there in Raqqa. She only dared to talk for a moment, but she said she wanted to jump off. And so she said that she wanted to contact the Swedish police. Okay, why that? She said they were preparing an attack on Sweden. - Okay ... What else did she say? - She couldn't say more. - Can I give her your number? -Yes of course. Absolutely. Do it. You just have to get another number. Do you have a pencil? It's better that she is calling me on this. - Are you sure she is? - I recognized the voice. I will still have to determine her identity in some way. Do you know anything I can ask her who only she knows? Miryam Kheir ... -Hello. - Hi, Miryam. -Hi johan. Is it quiet tonight? - Yes, so far. Say! Honestly now. I know they talk about me. They think you're paranoid. - Did they say that? -Yes. And naive. - What, then, "naive"? - Do we have to talk about this? -Yes! Why am I naive? -I do not know. They think you trust too much on your sources, that you are uncritical ... For real? Do you think so too? You know I don't. I know you. - Is that what happened? -I must go. -Stop it. Is that what happened? -I must go. Is that what happened? Calle, quit. Now you just infect. Bye. - Hello, is that Pervin?  Yes.  Hi. You, by the way ... I ... I have to ask a question first. What was your math teacher's name in Nine? - Bodil Ljungberg -Okay. Good. You can call me Eva. I know you  in a hurry, say what you want to say.  Take me away from here. I can't pretend my child stay here, we will die. I understand. But Dolores said you   mentioned something about an attack on Sweden.  They have sent a man to Sweden to carry out a terrorist attack. Okay okay. Who then? They call him "the traveler" - al-Musafir. Okay. What else do you know?  - Nothing more.  -Think. You know more.  - I really must ...  Anything. Hello? Pervin? - Who did you talk to? -What does it look like? -I beg! - You don't usually pray at night. And you usually don't hit me. If you hit me again, I'll leave you. Go! The buses to Arlanda  leaves from gate 4.  It's cold in the morning. But at least it is getting lighter. I never get used to Swedish winter. It's so cold and dark. But I get hot when I see one sister who knows how to dress. Who cares about religion. - The only thing I want is to serve God. -Good. My wife always said that too. -Where are you traveling? - To Iraq, on business. Iraq? I come from Baghdad. -Is that so? -Yes. I lived there until I was ten. - "Traveler"? -Yes. It was broken, so I know nothing more. “This can be important, I think. -Absolutely. If she is genuine ... Yes, she is. I established her identity. - But she is a "walk-in". - Are you jealous, right? She came to us. She is difficult to judge, but I can work it up. This can be important for real. It can also be invented for to get a ticket out of Raqqa. Or someone who wants to spread disinformation with us. - Or old cupboard food. - Mm, we have to check it out. - Okay, have you talked to Sara? - No, damn it. -Not yet. -What are you going to say? Everything except who is my source. She is mine, I'm not going to let them take her. In addition, it can be dangerous to hand over. She can disappear. - So this is going to be your revenge? -Stop it. Or yes. I can't lie down and die. - Do you think I'm wrong? - I think you're doing just right. Thank you. Bye. - How was Pervin when you knew her? - She reminded you a little. -How? - Alone, lost. - Did she have a family? - Just mom. Only spoke Turkish. She was nice. I thought it would go well for her. - And she met ... Husam. -Yes. - How was he, then? -Småkriminell. - But kind of in some way. -Okay... - Was he religious? - No, not at the beginning. But he had such friends. - What happened then? - It went fast, a few weeks only. It was some basement mosque. She began to veil. - One day she was gone. - Didn't you hear from her? I received a text message from Turkey. Everything was great. Then it was quiet. Purple Pervin ... I'm so glad she's alive. There there. Emil, when you release you have 3 seconds on you before the grenade explodes. Do you follow? Two ... three ... bam! There we died. Give me. I said it was a dummy. Do you know what it means? It's fake, it's not a real grenade. It's quiet, Emil. It is quiet. Jacob, shave off your beard. - You too, Emil. -Why? - It's best. - How are you, Emil? Should we drive again? - Yes, yes, I'm fine. - Yeah, is she a mythomaniac? - No, no idea. But it's not old cupboard food. I probably know quite well who these are. We have a good look at them, but no investigation is ongoing. -Okay. Any stars? - He is quite famous. Omar Soudani. Involved in a blast in Lebanon, has been fighting in Syria for a few years. The rest are ordinary idiots. Stop, stop. Wait, now it's calling. - Hi, Pervin.  - Hi, it's me.  - Are you going to help me?  - If you help me. - I've said everything I know.  - Find out more.  - But ... how?  - We're not a fucking travel agent.  If you want help,  You have to help me You have to work for me But what, what do you want me to do? - You want me to spy?  - Yes, I do.  - But these men are murderers!  - That's why it's so important.  You can save many lives. You   have a chance to do something amazing.  Hello? Each group should choose one of the three articles. -Are you listening? What? Israel, Palestine.

What are you doing? -I suffer. I am doing a newspaper article about Israel. Just lies. -How do you know that? - I have read, found on the net. It is genocide of Palestinians. Israel is worse than the Nazis. - Lucky you live here, then. -No, it's not. I live in the world kind of most racist country. After the United States, typ. - How "racist"? - No one here will get a job. Maybe as a cleaner, but not a lawyer. Because then you have to change your name to type Erik or Caroline. -Do not you believe me? -It's not that... Have you ever seen a cop named Mustafa? No. Muslims must not be cops. Everyone sleeps think that all Muslims are terrorists. - Are there no Muslims? - Yes, but they are no longer Muslims. They have been forced to give up their faith to be police officers. It is so. You're very brave who dare to talk about these things. -Thanks. - Most people your age ... You seem much more read than they are. - They don't take that. -I know. - But where do you find these things? - I read the ashes online. - Can't you send me a link? -Mm, sure.
