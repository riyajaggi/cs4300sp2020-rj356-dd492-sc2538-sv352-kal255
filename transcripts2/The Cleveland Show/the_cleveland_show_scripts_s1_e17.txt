 Propecia, hot wings, and night sweats from our adjustable-rate mortgage. Now, pass those eggs. Uh-uh. Remember what Dr. Fist said about your cholesterol? Yes. He said it was "appalling" and "life-threatening." - Pass the eggs. - This is your breakfast, Cleveland. The same breakfast you've been eating for the past two weeks. More Twigs? Fiber Twigs, the cereal that lowers your cholesterol. [CRUNCHES] Aah! I got a splinter. Because you got a mouthful of wood like usual. Huh? Oh. [BOTH LAUGHING] ROBERTA: Hey. - Oh, come on, baby.

 I need you alive and healthy for the karaoke contest this weekend. We could win $500. And I don't want a repeat of our high school talent show. [SINGING] Love Love will keep us together Donna, I got my license. [FARTS] - Oh, Roberta. ROBERTA: I'm in my room! That's your breakfast getting down to business. Here's your lunch. Bran muffin, can of beans. And for dessert, some of that Jamie Lee Curtis yogurt that makes you poop. [FARTS] Damn, Daddy. Remember when that cat crawled in the air-conditioning duct and died? And we couldn't get it out for 16 months? That was like a Glade Plugln compared to this. Ha, ha! Heat rises. I smell nothing. Oh, what do you think you're...? Aah! Oh, no. Oh, put me down. Put me down. [FARTS THEN GRUNTS] [FARTING AND GRUNTING] [GROANING] Oh, what if they come in here? What the...? Oh, my. Oh, no. Auntie Em. Auntie Em. [CAT SCREECHING] Oh, Terry, hurry up. We gotta go. But I'm not finished... Oh! Oh, no. Ow! Oh! Ow! Oww! My urethra. [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS AND FARTS] I'm sorry, Terry. But I'm on this new high-fiber diet. And l... My hermaphrodite yogurt. If you're gonna be my partner... ...I don't wanna hear one more fart out of you, clear? - Yes, sir. - Good. Because l... Oh, you bastard. Ha, ha. Sometimes they no make a noise. [COUGHING] Look out! [BOTH SCREAM] I can't believe my last breath is gonna be your ass gas. I always knew we would die this way. Goodbye, Terry. [BOTH SCREAM] - Gee, thanks, Mr. Flippers. - Gee, thanks, Mr. Flippers. Terry, always keep your eyes on the road. Will do. And, Cleveland, see a doctor about your ungodly flatulence. - Yes, sir. - Good. See you later, peoples. - Bye, Mr. Flippers. - Bye, Mr. Flippers. - You're deep. - Thank you. I was a Philosophy major. Everything checks out, Cleveland. Your flatulence is a perfectly normal side effect of a high-fiber diet. So you're saying all this farting is okay? No. I'm saying it's medically necessary. But what about the social stigma? Won't people consider me a gross farting pig... ...like Tommy Lasorda? - I'll write you a note. You mean a free pass to pass gas wherever and whenever I want to? The medical term is a fart card. But remember, Cleveland, with great power comes great responsibility. [IGGY POP'S "LUST FOR LIFE" PLAYING] [GASPING] Fart card. I got a lust for life [FARTS] [RALLO LAUGHING] A lust for life [FARTS] Well, I'm just a modern guy Of course I've had it in the ear before [FARTS] 'Cause of a lust for life 'Cause of a lust for life ["BOOGIE WOOGIE BUGLE BOY" PLAYING ON KARAOKE MACHINE] [SINGING] He was a famous trumpet man From out Chicago way [SOFTLY] He had a boogie style That no one else could play He was the top man at his craft But then his number came up...

We get you farting too and we'll be unbeatable. Cleveland, I wanna win by singing. Why? Take the low road, baby. [FARTS] It's so much more fun and profitable. I mean, who would you rather be? Weird Al Yankovic or Dido? Dido. You and I are very different people, Donna. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Uh-huh. Singing. Ha. Don't have to pay royalties on these babies. [FARTING] No, sir. My creative output is entirely my own. Cleveland. It's about Loretta. Loretta? Ha! What about her? What about my lousy two-timing, ugly-ass ex-wife? She's dead. Oh. [FARTS] Yes, I understand. I will handle the arrangements. Thank you for the sentiment. [FARTS] - Goodbye. - I am so sorry, Cleveland. Loretta had no next of kin in Quahog. So one of my old friends is driving the body down here. The funeral is Friday. [FARTS] There she is. Ugh. What a drive. Thirteen hours is a long way with only one hand on the wheel. Oh! - Ha. Sex. - You wanna see her? Why is she wearing a French maid's costume? I wanted to nail a dead French maid. - Giggity-giggity. - I've missed you, Glenn. - Do you know how she died? - Yep. It all started when Brian dug up a brontosaurus skull. All right, little more. Little more. I'll have this sucker in the bedroom in no time. [WATCH BEEPS] Oh, time for United States of Tara. No, no, no. Oh, God. Wait, what's that? Oh, look at her gross boobs. [ALL LAUGHING] I'll run her over to the funeral home. I'm heading up to Langley. Got a background gag in a bachelor-party scene on American Dad! Oh, that's good. Paying work. Save it. Have fun on your spinoff, Joey. I will. And this ain't no Joey, you one-note fuck! We are so sorry, Cleveland. Please accept our tuna for this difficult time. It's a pity you two will have to drop out of the karaoke finals. Such a disappointment. Excuse me? I don't think we're dropping out. Hell, no. We're gonna win to spite Loretta. She was an awful person. How did Cleveland Jr. Take the news? Why would my son care that my ex-wife is dead? Oh, boy. [SINGING] Warm white socks Warm white socks Gee, you were fun Gee, you were fun I washed and rolled you up in a ball Carried you upstairs then down the hall You make me feel 11 feet tall My warm white socks - Good evening, Cleveland Jr. - Hello. Son, I have some good news and some bad news. Well, can I have the good news first? The good news is that I bought you a handsome new funeral suit. Wow! [ROY ORBISON'S "PRETTY WOMAN" PLAYING] And now for the bad news. Junior, your mother Loretta is dead. [FARTS] The funeral is Friday. Watch out for this boy, Lord. Oh, I see. Well, that's very sad news. - Lf you wanna cry, it's okay. - Don't hold it in, Junior. I've been reading up on child grief... - Oh, Dr. Gensler's book? - Uh, I'm not sure. In that free parenting magazine they give away at the supermarket. Oh, because Dr. Gensler said that it's possible to grieve for a loss... ...before an actual death. I've already mourned the loss of my mother and that broken family. And now I have a new family that will love and support me in a way... ...that, unfortunately, my biological mother never could. I still don't know if you're smart or stupid. So you're okay? I'm sad that Mom was never able to find what she was looking for in her life, Daddy. But, yeah, I'm okay. Okay, Junior, but we're here if you need us. That boy is a ticking bomb. - Say, you up for a nooner? - No. - What time is it? - One-thirty. - You up for a 1:30-er? - No. See you at 2:00. [FARTS] [BELL TOLLS] Mm. Poor Junior. Keeping it all in. You watch. In 20 minutes, we'll be picking up the pieces. And he's a big boy, so there gonna be a lot of pieces. [LAUGHS] I'm sorry. That's inappropriate. Loretta Brown was a woman I did not know. But according to Wikipedia... ...a woman by that name won a Grammy in 1989 for best spoken-word album. Another woman by that name, or possibly her as well... ...served in the Australian parliament between 1958 and 1964. - Citation needed. KENDRA: Praise the Lord. We now commit the body of Loretta Marie Callender Brown to the earth. [WHIMPERS THEN CLEARS THROAT] Stay strong, Junior. [CRYING AND CLEARING THROAT] [WAILING] No! No! No! It's too soon. Why, God? Why? [FARTING] I'll miss you both. All right, close it up. Who's up for barbecue? [CLEVELAND CRYING] [WHIMPERING] Do you still love her, Cleveland? No. No, baby. I love you. [FARTS] Having an emotional breakdown... ...on your ex-wife's casket is a strange way to show it. I'm sure I'll have the same reaction on your casket in front of my third wife. Cleveland, that was the woman you always complained about. The woman who cheated, who slept with your friends. Well, one friend. No, there were more. Peter Griffin told me at our wedding. Mayor West, OIlie Williams, Frank Sinatra, Jr... ...the greased-up deaf man. - Guy. The point is, Cleveland, she wasn't good to you. I know. I have no idea what happened at the funeral. I don't know why I lost control or why I'm still upset about it. Well, you better... [FART HISSES] You'd better figure it out, Cleveland, before you lose another wife. I would slam the door but the children are sleeping. - I'll act as if you did. - Thanks. You don't have to be so damn dramatic. RALLO: Don't worry, Cleveland. She ain't leaving. She broke. Hot tea, how classy. - Do you take it with one dong or two? - No, it's too hot for dongs. Just honey. It's good for the karaoke vocal chords. Hey, maybe you and Donna should just give up now, eh? Whatever, Tim. No, no, no. I'm just... I'm giving you friendly trash talk. Now you say something rude about me or how fat my mama is. Look, Tim, Donna's not even speaking to me... ...much less singing with me. - So you got nothing to worry about. McFALL: Wrong. Dead wrong. - Mrs. Hot Brown's singing with me. - Say what? Said she wanted to piss you off by showing she'd be happier... ...singing with the most pathetic piece of human garbage she could find. Her words. Ohh. I've got one wife that's dead and one wife that hates me... ...just like O.J. Simpson. He's hurting bad. Why else would a black guy talk that way about O.J. Simpson? Yes. And what kind of friends would we be if we didn't help him? Normal American male friends. Let's book while he's still in the john. I don't understand, Loretta. Why did I cry at your funeral? You did me so wrong. I moved on. So why am I upset? No, no, no. Wait. That's it. Peww! MAN: Ow! Hey, I'm trying to mourn over here. Oh, it's a cookie. Thank you. ["ENDLESS LOVE" PLAYING ON KARAOKE MACHINE] [BOTH SINGING] 'Cause you - You mean the world to me - You mean the world to me - Ohh - Ohh - I know - I know - I found in you - I found in you - My endless love - My endless love I am not gonna go out there and sing "On Top of Spaghetti." Well, how about "Yes! We Have No Bananas?" [GLASS SHATTERS] Donna, wait. There's something I gotta tell you. What, Cleveland? I figured out why I cried at Loretta's funeral. Survivor's guilt. Survivor's guilt? What does that mean, Cleveland? It means I fell out of that bathtub... ...more times than could possibly be funny and never a scratch. She falls out once, breaks her neck, and gets Quagmired. It could have been me. You cried at your ex-wife's funeral because of survivor's guilt? Donna, let me ask you something. Would you cry if Robert died? Hush your mouth. You still wanna sleep with him, don't you? I'd like to be asked, so I can tell him no. It's not how it seemed when you first said you'd like to be asked. Survivor's guilt. No looking back? No looking back. McFALL: Oh, my God. We do have more olives. [SINGING] Love Love will keep us together Think of me, babe, whenever [AUDIENCE BOOING] - Where's the farting? GUS: Any ass can sing. We want the singing ass. AUDIENCE [CHANTING]: Cleveland, Cleveland, Cleveland. Better give them what they want, baby. - You are my soul mate. AUDIENCE: Cleveland, Cleveland, Cleveland. [FARTING IN RHYTHM] [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [TIM CRYING] You see, Arianna? I told you you should have let me take a poop on the stage. Tim, that can't be your answer to everything. I love you, Cleveland. I love you too, Loretta. [FARTS] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] CLEVELAND: Goodbye, Loretta. [ENGLISH - US - SDH]
