 Previously on Beware the Batman... A man like Simon Stagg would undoubtedly be involved in land deals as well... And knowing Stagg, so undoubtedly shady... What if we'd still been in there? We would've been killed! Yes, you would have. Sapphire, we shouldn't be doing this here. I don't care. What? Your father is Simon Stagg. My boss. One of the wealthiest men in Gotham.

 You're his only daughter and I... I don't care what the world sees. I know the man you are inside. That's who I love. Don't worry about Daddy. He's gonna love you, just like I do, Rex Mason... - What is it? - I don't know. Stay here. Batman, an internal alarm has sounded at Stagg Industries. Plot the fastest route. Stop! Control, this is Mason. I need backup. Get out of there! It's not safe! Just breathe. Sounds to me like a bit of old-school corporate espionage. Who knows what Stagg is cooking up in that house of horrors he calls a business.

 Stagg security is state-of-the-art. How'd this guy get in and out without anyone seeing him? Uh, Bruce... exactly what did we just purchase in there? Hormone-free bovine glands. I'm experimenting with my body's need for sleep. Currently it's four hours. I'd like to get it down to two. Certain glands are rich in adrenals. Very good. I look forward to blending them up for you. Alfred, why are you driving me today? Where's Ms. Yamashiro? I felt it best she shadowed Jason Burr as he moves into his new lab. Things have been quiet since the attack on Wayne Manor, but... Mr. Wayne. Small world. Dr. Ravencroft! Nice to see you again. Now that you're no longer my patient, I think we can drop the "Dr." Only if you'll drop the "Mr. Wayne." Consider it dropped, Bruce. - Nice car. - Thank you. A little extravagant for one, isn't it? I'd be happy to offer you a lift. How about tomorrow night? Tomorrow night? Yes. Sure. For... A fundraising dinner downtown. 8:00. It's black tie. And don't forget your checkbook. Don't say one word. What, and make you even more flustered? I'm not flustered. I'm not! Don't worry. I'll keep your bovine glands on ice. Mr. Stagg. Sapphire and I... I wanted to tell you myself. No need to explain, my boy. Sapphire knows I've always supported her decisions. After the way you went after that intruder, I think she's made a fine choice. Oh, Daddy. Thank you, sir. I love your daughter. And I promise always to protect her. Can I get you something, darling? No. Just a little nausea. Hmm... What is it, Daddy? Sapphire, the gases Rex was exposed to... They've never been tested on humans. I just don't want to see you hurt if there are complications. You are one lucky son of a gun. Rex! Are you alright? Rex! Sapphire... help! What... whatever you are, stay away from us, you freak! Sapphire... Computer, access the security footage from last night's break-in at Stagg Industries. Working... Sorry, Mr. Wayne. Access to Stagg Industries' security footage has been denied. Looks like Batman will be making another trip. Please tell me you packed my Batsuit. Let me go! Interesting. Rex Mason? Mason! Stop! I don't want to hurt anyone. Tell her to not be afraid. Tell who? Who are you talking about? Sa... - What is it? - A death sentence. Whatever those gases were that Mason was exposed to, they've made his cellular structure completely unstable. He'll die, Alfred. Unless I find him. Bethanie! Hello. Did I catch you at a bad time? Not at all. Just finishing work. What are you wearing? Sorry, what? I'm hoping it's a tux. Because it's 7:30 and I'm expecting you in half an hour. With my checkbook. That's right. Let me just finish this up and... - Where did he come from? - What? Bruce, did you say something? Project Metamorpho... Erased... Who would have that kind of access? Simon Stagg. Hope you don't mind if I access your personal computer, Mr. Stagg. Sapphire, we shouldn't be doing this here. I don't care... Mason was seeing Stagg's daughter. What did he say? "Tell her not to be afraid." That's where you're going. You're trespassing. And you're going to jail, Stagg. You didn't like your precious pampered daughter messing with the help. So you set Mason up for a little accident. Prove it. Give me time. Project Metamorpho, what is it? A game changer. Stagg Industries has found a way to weaponize genetic tissue. Imagine it. A soldier in battle, impervious to weather, bullets, fire, anything elemental. But not just impervious. A Stagg-branded Metamorpho can also manipulate these same elements, turning them against the attacker. It's going to kill Mason. We're still ironing out the kinks. The important thing is, he'll never have my daughter. And you'll never tell anyone what you've just seen. So beautiful. Mmm. Rex... Rex? No light! Please? Let me see you. The gas... changed me. Still not in control. Emotions affect mutations. It's still me, Sapphire. Man you... fell in love with. Oh, Rex. Why did this happen to us? Blame your father. Daddy didn't want his daughter marrying a security guard, so he tested one of his experiments on him. You're lying. Daddy would never do that. I told you he'd never accept me. I told you! Mason, the experiment has made your body unstable. Every time you change... Why can't you all just leave us alone? Rex! Sapphire! Mason, wait! - You hung up on me. - Yes, I did that. Sorry. Is this another bad time? - Actually... - I don't care. You owe me for standing me up last night. Let me make it up to you. Just... not right now. You're cold. Mmm. What? Security! Do that and you're a dead man. Oh, really? Why's that? Mason knows you were the one who set him up. Impossible. How? I told him. Why would you do that? To lure him here, and use you as bait. I... You... Are you insane? Breathe, Stagg. I need you alive. You're going to give me access to Project Metamorpho. Why would I do that? So I can find a cure. My security team is useless. You're all fired! How did you know... How did you know he'd come? There are two things in life everyone's powerless against. Love and revenge. He's in the building. Do something! Be Batman! I need more time. - Stall him. - Stall him? Just do it. And don't forget the plan. You... stay away! Did you even care that we were in love? Sapphire was bred for better. If you really loved her, you would have understood that. You didn't give me a chance! I'm ready. Get to the lab. Sapphire! Now, Stagg! What are you doing to him? Saving his life. Do it! What's going on? The antidote didn't take. You once said to me you didn't care what the world saw when it looked at me, because what you saw was the man inside. Can you still look at me, now, and feel the same? Rex. That's not fair. No. Mason, wait! Rex! You said you were going to save his life! You tried to blame my father, but all you wanted to do was destroy him. Daddy! There, there, sweetheart. Daddy's here. You're done. I saw the whole thing. You murdered that poor, heroic man! Really? Those videos you destroyed... Already sent a copy to the Gotham police. I'd get your affairs in order. Daddy. So, are you going to tell me what was so important that you had to blow off our first date and hang up on me? A guy, I didn't really know him that well, needed me. Relationship problems. I thought I could help. - Did you? - No. That kind of thing has never been my strong suit. Well, we'll see if we can change that. Could you excuse me for a moment? I need to make a call. Of course. I'm glad I'm not your patient anymore.
