 Previously on Beware the Batman... Like it or not, you need an assistant. As for Ms. Yamashiro, it's going to take more than an agility test to convince me. This job just got interesting. I'm proud to announce, Wayne Industries continues its quest, to advance the human condition through technology with an innovation that will address not only the nation's energy needs, but also the world's. The Ion Cortex is a global A.I. energy regulator. When completed, it will employ existing broadband networks

 to monitor energy production and usage in real time. It will eliminate energy waste, store surplus energy, and redistribute energy based on demand. According to initial projections, the Ion Cortex will produce a global energy surplus within five years of activation. Oh, that's incredible. - That's amazing. - I thought you'd like that. But don't take my word for it. Meet the man behind this breakthrough, Dr. Jason Burr. Okay. The world has plenty of energy, but we aren't using it correctly.

 The Ion Cortex will... Huh? I'm fine. The limo's a tank. Help him. Once you cross that line, you can't go back. One got away. It happens. That doesn't justify murder. I didn't have a choice. You always have a choice. You can save lives or you can take them. I don't need an ethics lesson from a nut dressed up like a bat. Too bad. You just got one. Dr. Burr, you okay? You... you saved my life. Okay, time to go. Everyone okay? Dr. Burr? Why were they after me? What did I do? You came up with the Ion Cortex. And it looks like someone besides Wayne Industries wants it... Badly. He's a target. Police custody? No. I don't trust the police. Dr. Burr, how would you like to be my guest at Wayne Manor? Will she be there? Of course. She'll never leave your side. The Ion Cortex holds the promise of absolute power. That is why your team was sent to retrieve Dr. Burr. You alone returned, empty-handed. Because a single woman managed to fight you off until Batman arrived. Some failures can be overlooked, but not by The League of Assassins. Silver Monkey, I trust you will not fail to bring me Dr. Burr. It will be done, Lady Shiva. You might say Wayne Manor is actually Wayne Fortress, Dr. Burr. Surveillance cameras monitor the house and grounds at all times. There are military grade motion and heat sensors in every room. If someone tampers with the alarm system, a fail-safe protocol seals the manor. No one gets in or out. If that doesn't prevent an intrusion, there's always the panic room. An impenetrable vault stocked with six months of supplies. Of course, Mr. Wayne hired Mr. Reese and his security team to make sure it doesn't come to that. That's correct, and it won't. There you are, Dr. Burr. You have every reason to feel safe here. All I need to feel safe is her. I couldn't agree more, Dr. Burr. I'm confident Ms. Yamashiro will make sure you're still here when I get back. Get back? Where are you going? Hot date. Well, as hot as a date can be at a museum reception. What about Dr. Burr? He's not my type. Don't wait up. Alfred... A shirt that expensive, I'm surprised the cuffs don't link themselves. You can't buy class. I need to find out who's after Burr. Perhaps, you should search Dr. Burr's lab. Thank you, Alfred. You know, I've done this before, right? And you're getting better at it every day. So, alone at last. We can finally get to know each other better. No. Okay, I'll go first. My favorite type of music is jazz. Do you like jazz? I hear you. Jazz isn't for everyone. But I bet I can change your mind. Hmm. Who sent you? When the Ion Cortex goes online, all those lights will be connected. So will the rest of the lights on Earth. It's going to change the world. - I know. - You do? Yes. That's why you're the target. What about your work? I mean, you must have some incredible stories. Or would you have to kill me if you told me any of them? Danger's not so great when it's real and you're in it. And yes, if I told you about my past, I'd have to kill you. Wait. You're joking? And look at that. You can smile. Don't get used to it. - Your life is still at risk. - What do you mean? I thought Wayne Manor was completely safe. You're never completely safe. Who sent you? It's too late. You'll never stop him now. Computer, call the manor. You're good. Anything strange happens, anything at all, yell. I'm right outside the door. Sleep tight. You know, I'm not that tired. You want to stick around? We could talk some more. Or I can talk and you can ignore me some more. Dr. Burr is in his room. Your team can lock the property down for the night. Right away, sir. The package is down for the night. - Anything to report? - No, sir. All clear. Good. I'm sorry, Batman. All communication channels to the manor have been disabled. Try the Batcave com link. That will signal Alfred, and no one else knows about it. Great. Traffic! Alfred? They're coming for Burr. Activate the fail-safe protocol and get Burr to the panic room. Now! But how will you get inside the manor? I'll find a way. Shh. Ms. Yamashiro? Did you change your mind about talking? Something's wrong. We're moving... Quietly. Will that work? I'm taller than that. I... Panic room. Now! Computer, I have to get inside the manor with the grid still on so no one can follow. An explosion on the roof where the lasers are least dense could momentarily disrupt the grid, Batman. If you are moving fast enough, there is a chance you will access the manor unharmed. How much of a chance? 28%. Not bad. Thanks for the escort. I'll take it from here. Entering drop zone, Batman. Goodbye for now, Computer. Good luck, Batman. I need a new security system. You? You're alive. You two know each other? Not now. Stay behind me. I don't know, he looks tough. Maybe I should help. You will die for your betrayal. Um... Um... I'll be back here if you need me. Hand claws, Silver Monkey? I thought you felt such weapons were without honor. Do not speak of honor. Traitor! The ones than can dodge bullets are always a bother. Shall we? It only gets worse from here. Worse for who? Next time. Wait. What are you... What happens now? I'm overwriting the manor's fail-safe protocol so help can reach us. There. Help? I thought we were safe in here. You're never completely safe. Is that a bomb? It is. Hence the need for help. Hands... Slowly. A detonator? For me? You shouldn't have. Now, disarm the charge, and maybe I'll let you keep breathing. You will regret sparing my life, Katana. Way ahead of you. You are not worthy of The League of Assassins. Now, you dishonor us both. The Soultaker Sword. It wasn't destroyed. You stole it. It seems you've served a purpose after all. - How bad are you? - I'm still alive. Good. Stay that way. I hate to spoil the evening, but that looks like a titanium blast door. You're charge might as well be a fire cracker. This hero stuff is going to kill me. Not yet. Keep pressure on that wound. I should have killed him when I had the chance. No, Burr is safe. You did exactly what you were supposed to do. Careful. I'm starting to think I was wrong about you. You wouldn't be the first. Ms. Yamashiro. Give me room. I'm a doctor. Wait. Are you a medical doctor? I am, tonight. It's okay, Miss Yamashiro. I'm going to save your life, just like you saved mine. Thanks, but it's not that bad. Stay with me, Ms. Yamashiro! I won't let you go. I swear it! So, Katana is alive. The traitor faked her own death. Unexpected and intriguing. Did you discover any more surprises at Wayne Manor? No. Nothing of value. No matter. Katana is prize enough. And the scientist? Leave him be. We will find another way to obtain the Ion Cortex. As you wish, Lady Shiva. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
