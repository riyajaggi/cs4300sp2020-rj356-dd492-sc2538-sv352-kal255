 Previously on Beware the Batman... There will come a time, when I will no longer be here. I need to know that you will still be protected when I'm gone. Bruce Wayne, I'd like you to meet Tatsu Yamashiro. I've hired her to be your new driver and bodyguard. That's a good boy, Joe. Just a little longer. Shiny, shiny. Hey! You just hit a girl. No, I just hit a criminal. You've given me quite a run.

 Six warehouses, stolen hi-tech electronics worth millions. Really? Millions? I just like the way they sparkled, Mister, uh... Batman. Magpie. Ooh! Nice belt. Shiny, shiny. - Can I have it? - I'm using it right now. How about a shiny pair of handcuffs instead? Who are you? I... I don't know. Just you and me, Lieutenant Gordon. Mom's at an early meeting. We're having eggs in a hole with bacon. So, what perp are you after today?

 First, it's Dad, not Lieutenant. Second, "perp"? Yeah, perp. Bad guy. I know what perp means, Barbara. Just figured maybe I can help. Take a look at the case file. And if I do a good job, you'll introduce me to Batman? Not this again. Oh, come on, Dad. I know he helped you out with those Pyg and Toad guys. Barbara, for all we know, Batman could've been working with Pyg and Toad. I've told you before. Batman is not a hero. No one who takes the law into their own hands is. The vic's at Gotham General. Mind wiped clean. Freaky, huh, Lieutenant? The dust here has been disturbed. Lunkhead. What do you know about Batman? Uh, something of a crime-fighter, isn't he? More like a nut. Dresses like a bat, skulks in the shadows. Well, "nut" is a relative term. Compared to his enemies, he seems quite sane. Uh, no. Sorry, still nut. Gotta say, cushy lifestyle you've got here, Major. I can see why you stay. I sense a "but" coming. Don't get me wrong, I owe you more than I can ever repay. And I'm happy to stay until your leg is healed. But... Things are not always what they seem, Tatsu. Consider that before making any decisions. Hope I'm not interrupting. Oh, come in, Bruce. We were just having some coffee. Would you like a green tea? Thank you, Alfred, that would be fine. So, how are you fitting into our little family, Miss Yamashiro? Alfred told me you were in the military before this. Stationed in Condac, Wayne Manor must be a big change from the desert. Definitely a change. But the Major's been taking good care of me. Major? Is that something you called Alfred as a child? Uh, yes, as a matter of fact. - I didn't realize Alfred had... - Oh, he didn't tell me. It's just a little trick of mine. I find, in business, it's helpful to learn to read people quickly. I notice that whenever you call Alfred "Major," your voice lowers and you unconsciously look up. The same way a child would look up to an adult. If I was to guess, Alfred worked with a member of your family when you were a child. Your father? Was he MI6 as well? Quite amazing, Mr. Wayne. My father and Alfred did work together. They were partners. Before he died. Why didn't you ever tell me you had a partner who died? He was in a car crash, an accident. So, Tatsu, she's not just an acquaintance. - She's... - My god-daughter. I knew you might respond like this, that's why I didn't say anything. I don't like secrets, Alfred. You are the very definition of a secret, Bruce. Tatsu is more than capable of being your bodyguard and driver. Test her, you'll see. I had the Batcomputer do a sweep of anything it could find on Joe Braxton and his connection to Magpie. Braxton was part of some sort of research team at Blackgate Penitentiary. - What were they doing? - Doesn't say. But there were boxes from Blackgate in his warehouse. Could be the connection. It says here there was another member of the team. A psychotherapist named Bethany Ravencroft. And she has a practice right here in Gotham. Huh? Shiny, shiny. Uh... You know, after we last met, I couldn't help wondering what makes someone put on a bat costume. Something to hide? Who said this was a costume? Mmm, I like that. You and I should be friends. We've so much in common. Not gonna happen. What's the matter, bad boy? Too much bird for you to handle? Too bad, I was looking forward to getting my hands on that shiny, shiny belt. Goodbye, my little bat. Braxton. Why did you wipe his mind? I was looking for something that belongs to me. What? Catch me and maybe I'll tell you. I hope you can fly, Mr. Bat. No one is going to cage this bird again. Caged again? Alfred, Magpie was a prisoner at Blackgate Penitentiary. That's the connection to Braxton and Ravencroft. I need to query the computer for women between the ages of 25 and 35 who were there when Dr. Ravencroft conducted her experiments. If I'm right, I should get a hit. Huh? Lunkhead don't like you. Lunkhead, you're not in trouble. I just wanna talk about Batman. Argh! Batman not hurt Lunkhead again. Barbara, sweetheart, now is not good. Lunkhead, I'm sorry. I know it was Batman who put you away before. That he put you in a coma for two months. Lunkhead not go back to prison. Lunkhead been good. I know. I just have a few questions and I'll go away. I brought candy. I have a file with me from the time that you spent at Blackgate. It says you were involved in an experiment, something about mind control. Uh-huh. Wanted to fix Lunkhead brain. Didn't work. More candy now. Why would Batman care about this experiment? Don't know. One more question... Was there anyone else in the experiment with you? Lady, nice to Lunkhead. In other cage. Took her away. Do you remember her name? Margaret Sorrow. According to the Gotham PD database, she was a kleptomaniac. A repeat offender that received 10 years, but served two. Where is she now? Unknown. Five years ago, she just disappeared. Right after leaving Blackgate. Miss Yamashiro, I should only be with Dr. Ravencroft for an hour. You can get yourself a coffee or something if you want. Just don't be late. "Don't be late." Just breathe. Remember, you're only working for this marshmallow temporarily. I need to punch something. Mr. Wayne, I just wanna tell you it's a real honor. I'm a big admirer of all the good your company does. - Thank you very much, um... - Cassie. She's been fluttering about all day. We don't get a lot of celebrities. So, I have to ask. Of all the therapists in Gotham, why me? I was looking for someone out of the public eye. I didn't realize you still use these. Inkblots? More of a curiosity, really. See anything interesting? Just splashed ink on paper. This is A. L. Coltrane of the IRS. I need to speak to Dr. Ravencroft urgently. Cassie, I'm with... You know who I'm with. I know, but there's a man from the IRS on the phone. He's demanding to talk to you. Something about a lawsuit and falsified insurance claims. He's really mean. I am sorry about this Mr. Wayne, I'll be right back. Ah! I have no interest in hurting you. Haven't you figured it out? I can't feel pain. One more piece they stole from me. Let me help you get it back. I understand what it's like to fight your true nature. And you're going to lose that fight if you don't get help. But I'm afraid. Afraid of what? That I've already lost. What... Hush now, little bat. Let the curare do its work. Just go to sleep. Ah! Shiny, shiny. Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey. Don't worry, I didn't peek beneath the mask. A person's secrets are sacred. Magpie, I meant what I said. I can help. Quiet! Oh, sorry, that was rude. I appreciate the offer, but I've already got it covered. Braxton created this helmet to remove memories. To reformat the brain's hard drive, wiping it clean. But with a little reprogramming, I found a way to reverse the process. To put the memories back. My memories await. First, though, yours need to go away. I'd say it's been a pleasure, but you won't remember I said it. So... Goodbye, Batman. What is this? Whose face is that? You don't know. Two personalities in one body. Unaware of each other. What are you talking about? Margaret Sorrow was part of an experiment Braxton and Ravencroft were conducting. For your participation, you received early release. No. They took my memories. They stole them from me. I'm sorry, but you did this to yourself. Margaret Sorrow volunteered. The experiment was meant to strip the bad out of criminals and in your case, it worked. For a while, anyway. They gave you a new name, a new face, a new life. But sometimes, the bad is just too strong. It has a way of coming back. No. Lies! I want to know who I am. And she can give that back to me. Don't move, Batman. You either, bird girl. Shiny, shiny. Argh! You're not going anywhere. We don't have time for this, Lieutenant. Help the doctor, I'll stop Magpie. No! You've destroyed it. My memories! I'll never get them back now. What have you done? We can find another way. Margaret Sorrow's still in there. Margaret Sorrow is gone. There is only Magpie now. No more shiny, shiny. Is the doctor safe, Lieutenant? Shaken up, but fine. She had no idea Cassie was once Margaret Sorrow. Makes sense. Different face, different memories. My guess, Magpie subconsciously drove her here for revenge. Well, now Margaret, Cassie, Magpie, whatever her name, goes back to jail. Put her back in the hole that created her. - Is that justice? - That's the law. Will I be getting the same justice? Yes, but not tonight. Just so we're clear, nothing has changed between us. We aren't friends. You helped me tonight, so I owed you. But the next time we cross paths... Mr. Wayne, your car is ready. Mr. Wayne? Hmm, someone's late. Mr. Wayne, your car... Mr. Wayne, maybe you didn't hear me. Let the tests begin.
