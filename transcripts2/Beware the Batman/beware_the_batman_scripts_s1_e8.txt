 Previously on Beware the Batman... Tonight was your final test. And you aced it. Welcome to the family. Simon Stagg getting arrested is the best thing that's ever happened to this town, baby. Don't sell yourself short, Whale. Your arrest is going to be right up there. Good plan. You're welcome. What are you doing here?

 This is Gotham PD's collar. If that were true, you would have gotten here before me. We've been monitoring Stagg's holdings. And procedure dictates... Procedure can dictate all it wants. Whale's looted five Stagg warehouses in the past month. You're not a cop. And now you've forced my hand. Take 'em all. Including Batman. Shall we follow him, Lieutenant? No. Just take Whale in. Are you sure it isn't a bit much? You said yourself she has to be protected. And I agree.

 I know, but well... look at her. There's no way I can fight in this. I can't even move a finger. See? That was me trying to move a finger. If you're going out on the streets with me, I don't want you vulnerable. There are still other Stagg warehouses left unguarded. What we should be doing is going after the League of Assassins, and getting the Soultaker Sword back. The Argus Club's abandoned, the League is scattered... They could be anywhere in the world. I won't leave Gotham unprotected. So we don't even try to find them? We don't have to. They still want the Ion Cortex, which is... In Gotham. Okay, I get it. They'll be back. Tatsu, you must be patient. There's patient. And then there's spending weeks encasing me in one immoveable suit after another. I want to do something. You're not doing anything until you're suited up and armed. Okay, then. Suited up and armed. A sword and a mask, that's all. I can fight in this. See? There's one more thing. You have a code name, and I want one too. Call me Katana, when we're in the field. But, that was your name in the League of Assassins. I know. When I'm beating the stuffing out of them, I want them to know who I am. You and your men were caught robbing the warehouse, and in the trade we call that "dead to rights." Things are going to go easier for you if you talk to me. We will make a deal. Good. Finally. - Now... - You have until midnight, which would be four hours from this moment, to release my client. He will not be prosecuted. He will be cleared of every charge. This is a good deal, Lieutenant. I advise you take it. You've got to be kidding. This is a serious offer. Then I guess I'll see you in court. Lieutenant... easy now. Where is she? I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. My daughter, Barbara. I know you had your goons abduct her. Oh, that's too bad. But at least her daddy is a police officer. Of course, maybe nothing would have happened to Daddy's princess if he'd just taken the deal he was offered. Clock is ticking. Who knows what will happen to that kid after midnight. Lieutenant! Give me my daughter! This is ridiculous. What was I thinking? I was thinking a phone call would have been more practical. How long have you been there? Long enough. I like it. This is about Barbara. - How did you... - Police scanner. I've been looking for her all night. You have? Kidnapping is on my list of crimes too. This one puts you in a tough spot, though. And I can go places, do things you can't. It's time we start trusting each other, Lieutenant. We're on the same side. No, we're not. But I need you for this one. But only this one. If you say so. The last person to see Whale was his lawyer, Milo Match, - but he's dropped off the map. - He's dropped off your map. I'll find him on mine. Bring up the trackers I put on Whale's men. When did you do that? During the Humpty Dumpty case. I like to plan ahead. They're in The Cauldron. Can you get a satellite lock? There they are. They're in a ghost-heavy zone. Ghost? As in... haunted? No, The Cauldron used to be an industrial park. But after Gotham's financial crisis bankrupted so many corporations, it was abandoned. Now it's a no man's land. The people who live there have nowhere else to go. The ghosts of Gotham City's past. Mostly small time criminals. Nobody gets in or out without their permission. And the cops allow this? They tried policing The Cauldron years ago, but made no headway. The ghosts keep to themselves, so... Out of sight, out of mind. Ghosts working with Whale and Match... interesting. Whale is likely storing the stolen weaponry in one of these warehouses. Each heavily guarded, secluded. A perfect place to stash Barbara Gordon. Agreed. But which building? That one. Surrounded on three sides. Easy defensible. But this one is the closest to the road leading out of The Cauldron, which makes for an easy exit. They've taken a police officer's daughter. If there's gonna be a siege, it'll be right in the center of The Cauldron. - What we have is... - A shell game. I'll start with the warehouse to the west. If she's not there, I'll work my way through the others. Hey! What about me? You'll stay here and help Alfred. Excuse me? We're not a team. Not yet. You've seen me in action. I can handle myself. You're staying here. You know... Katana... If you're going to tell me to have patience, do me a favor and don't. Because your Cauldron lacks electricity, I am offering you something better than gold. You're kidding, right? You're not actually trying to make a deal with ghosts, are you? As I was saying... Hope you have a back-up plan. If not, you should get one. My dad's going to figure out where I am. He's a great detective. So I offer you a tanker of fuel, which is parked outside this building, in exchange for... Classic bad guy mistake. Trusting other bad guys. Dude, you can't just give it to them. They'll bail at the first sign of trouble. You are in way over your head. - Gentlemen, ladies... - I think they're all guys. Do we have a deal? Wonderful. We will make terrific partners. Your father has two hours left to accept our deal. He's not accepting anything. For your sake, he'd better. What are you looking for? These red dots are heat signatures. This is stupid. We should be out there backing him up. Doesn't it bother you to sit here? You're trained for this. Why does he think he can do it himself? Actions, not words get the job done. Understand? Perfectly. We have movement. Ten and two. Do you see them? Very clearly. I told you to stay in the Batcave. And I decided to convince you that you were wrong. Actions, not words. That sounds familiar. You have to take them out. Or they'll just regroup. I know what I'm doing. Not bad, huh? You didn't listen to a word I said. You have to take your ego out of this or you'll be dead within a year. For the record, I do not have an ego. It's called pride in my work. What's going on? The Cauldron's gone nuts. It's like a war zone. We're getting reports of the Batmobile down there. The chief wants tactical on this. This is gonna end in a siege. Heh-heh. Accepting the deal, I see. Let's go. Warehouse number one. Clear. Warehouse number two. Clear. This is the last warehouse. Our priority is Barbara Gordon. I need you to follow my lead. Exactly. I get it. We have different fighting styles. But our differences make us stronger. You know like, tomayto-tomahto. No. Those are the same things said differently. Exactly my point. Just... Follow my lead. I can't guarantee your safety here, baby. I can't guarantee yours either. Now take me to my daughter, before the ghosts learn how to count bullets. Now you're in for it, secondary bad guy. Batman and... Katana. Batman and Katana are going to tenderize you. Batman. You have exactly 60 seconds to leave this place. That's not going to happen. Daddy. Release her, Match. Step away and get down on the floor. Hands behind your head. Did you hear me? Oh boy, this is... uh. Okay. Let's just show him, Milo. He's not only my lawyer, he's my chief enforcer. Phosphorus Rex. Great name. Don't you think, baby? Katana, we need to... move. The sidekick didn't last long. I can do this all day, Batman. Daddy! Putting out a fire with a bigger fire. Rudimentary physics. Interesting. I know. I should have told you what I was going to do. My teamwork still needs help. But it worked, right? We got lucky. But there's a difference between just getting lucky, and forcing luck. So that's good, right? We'll keep working on it. They're coming for Whale, and that's on me. Thank you for saving my daughter, Batman, but you better get out of here. What are you doing? You're too good a cop to go down for scum like Whale. He used your family. You did what you had to do. They'll think I forced you to break Whale out, so he could take me to the warehouse. I don't want you to do this. You're the hero. I'm the vigilante. Those are the roles we play. It doesn't change the goal, "Protect Gotham." That's all that matters. Um. Thanks for saving me. That grappling thing is totally cool. Grapnel. It's called a grapnel. Grapnel, right. Hey, what's your suit made of? Wow! Batman is so cool. And did you see? He works with a girl. I could totally be like her one day. When can I have a grapnel? Not until you're old enough. When will that be? Never.
