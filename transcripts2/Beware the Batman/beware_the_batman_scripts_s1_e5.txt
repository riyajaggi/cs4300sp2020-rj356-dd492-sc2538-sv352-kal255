 You ain't gonna believe this. We got some kind of weird red statue. Hang on, it's doing something. Help. You gotta help me. Help! There's somebody alive in there. Get the Jaws of Life over here. Let's cut that guy out. Stop. Don't do anything. The suit is a bomb. Try to remove him and you can wipe out the entire block. What are you waiting for? An invitation? Get up there and arrest Batman.

 Get me the bomb squad down here. Now! Where is it? It has to be here. Tatsu? Looking for something? Um... yes. My keys. Can I help you find them? No, no. I'm sure they'll turn up. Where am I? Where did you jokers take me? Don't worry. We'll get you out as soon as we know how to deactivate the metal encasing you. Nothing will happen. I promise. Yeah? How did you get this number? And how did you reach me down here? We're 300 feet underground. I hacked your phone and modified your SIM chip. Gotham PD really should get better security for their equipment. I'll stick that in the suggestion box when I get a chance. - The man you've got... - Joseph Crimple, aka Ice Pick Joe. What? Who are you talking to? Who is out there? - Get me out of this thing! - What's your point? Ice Pick Joe is one of Tobias Whale's hit squad goons. Stay away from Whale, Batman. Sorry. Can't do that. Thought you deserved a courtesy call. Rodriguez? Gordon. Listen, I need you to send a squad car to... Hello? Hello? Batman can get reception but not me. Tobias Whale. The corpulent tick that feeds on the good citizens of Gotham. You know what they say, Batman. A fella's gotta eat. What happened to Ice Pick Joe? I have no idea. He didn't come to work a few nights ago. I thought you were what happened to him. Escort Mr. Bat out of here, boys. Feet first. Set the canon on St. Mary's Wall, and it will surely, surely fall. And three score men and three score more, cannot put it as it was before. Help! Get me out of here. In here. You gotta help me. Yo, Batman! I think there's guys trapped in there. You missed! Whoa! Nice shot, Batman. Somebody is sending Gotham a message, Lieutenant. How did you get in here? Why do I even ask? Tobias Whale's financial advisor, Donovan Baker. Gotham District Attorney, Marion Grange. Ice Pick Joe. And now, Whale's gone missing. What? There has to be a connection. There is. The Dumpler case. Come on, Dumpler. We're almost there. The sooner you testify against Whale, the sooner you and the whole city will be a lot safer. Incoming! Move it! I remember the Dumpler case. Humphry Dumpler worked for the mob. Genius accountant. Went crazy after you got him blown up. He escaped protective custody and was never heard from again. - Until now. - You done? No. You're probably next, Gordon. If Humpty Dumpty is after you, you need protection. I can take care of myself, Batman. I don't need some caped vigilante playing nursemaid. You let yourself in, let yourself out. Think, Tatsu, think. No choice. Got to bite the bullet. Oh, sorry, my dear. Uh, rule of thumb. Never sneak up on an old spy while he's making a sandwich. Did you need something? Uh, actually... yes. - Help. - Oh. You still missing your keys? I, uh, the truth is I am not looking for my keys. I know. You're looking for this. The Soultaker's Sword. - You know its name? - I do. What I'd like to know is how it came to be in your possession. Hey, Dad. I got us that low-fat, low-salt corn beef hash you like. Barb, you know I happen to like the one with extra fat and extra salt. That's off your menu, Lieutenant. Cool little toy soldier. He's in the house. Empty. Barbara, get out the back. Now! Get away from my daughter! He took him, Batman. He took my father. Computer. Last known address of Humpty Dumpty. A wall. I'll rephrase. Last known address of Humphry Dumpler, aka Humpty Dumpty. Last known address, 49 East 107th Street. House demolished. Known relatives? Mother missing in Star City. Presumed dead. Grandmother deceased under suspicious circumstances. - Here in Gotham? - Affirmative. 15 Hawthorne Avenue. Computer, analyze and augment resonance. Analyzing. Check harmonic frequencies to nullify that resonance. Frequency match. That frequency will deactivate the mesh inside the explosive shell material. Is this a good idea? Are you sure Mr. Wayne is out of town on business? Oh, Mr. Wayne, is almost always out on some kind of business. Best to make the most of it. MI6 was hunting for that sword for an eternity. So was the CIA. Here we are. The Soultaker's Sword, which, if you believe the legend, is able to steal the souls of men. Believe the legend. I have seen its power. I have seen the sword drain the soul from a man. Leaving him nothing but a shriveled husk. Empty as dust. That still doesn't explain how you came to have the sword. During the time I was supposedly stationed in Kandak, I was actually working undercover for the CIA. Initiated into the League of Assassins, I was to determine the whereabouts of international criminal Ra's al Ghul. Instead, I discovered this sword. The League intended to use it to reign terror down upon the world. Once I had it, I realized it was too dangerous even to hand over to the CIA. So, instead, I went into hiding. That is why I took the job with you. Something doesn't quite add up. If Silver Monkey and the League of Assassins know the Soultaker's Sword is here, why are we still alive? Harmonic frequency complete. These will stop the suits from detonating. I need to find where Humpty's got Gordon and Whale. A castle. Hello, Batman! You made it. Now the battle can begin. That's right, Batman. That one was empty. Which one has Lieutenant Gordon? Which one has Tobias Whale? Can you find them in time? Come on, man. Save me from that lunatic. Stay here and stay down. Forget that. This isn't my fight. I'm gone. I guess I'm kind of glad you didn't stay out it. Less talking, more running. No! I will have my justice. I will have my revenge. Humpty? Time to stop. I think not. Time to die. Huh? Huh? It's not my fault, Batman. I never really wanted to hurt anyone. Not like they hurt me. They dragged me into the middle of their war. Lieutenant Gordon, Tobias Whale, their war. I just wanted to go back to play with my numbers and my toys. But I can't. I can't go back. Humpty... Humphry. Listen to me. We can work this out. You're right. They dragged you into their war. But that's still not justification for what you've done. You've been the best fun I've had in years. Such fun. ♪ All the king's horses ♪ ♪ And all the king's men ♪ ♪ Can't put Humphry Dumpler back together again ♪ ♪ All the king's horses ♪ ♪ And all the king's men.. ♪ ♪ All the king's horses and all the king's men.. ♪ ♪ All the king's horses and all the king's men.. ♪ Lieutenant Gordon, come in. You're not gonna believe this. Go ahead. I'm down here at the blast bunker. All these bomb suits suddenly deactivated. We can cut them out safely now, Lieutenant. Why would Humpty Dumpty do that? Just let them all go? Humpty's broken, but that doesn't make him pure evil. Lovely. You get that from your costume vigilante Book of Proverbs? He lost the battle and he's walking away honorably. But something tells me the war is far from over.
