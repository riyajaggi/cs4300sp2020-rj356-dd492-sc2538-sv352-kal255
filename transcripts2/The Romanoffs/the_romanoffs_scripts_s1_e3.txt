 Thank you. When they fired Rebecca Morris, we thought we were done. Now that you are here, we film, film, film. You are a star. She's just an actress. You know, I think some music would be nice.

Ms. Rogers, may I? "Ladybug's" my favorite movie. When you killed that snake in the bathtub. Of course. My empress has arrived. Madame Director. [in French] It is my great honor to finally work with you. At last. Oh, that is very flattering, but it is I who am the lucky one. And I'm not fucking around. You have saved our little show. Ms. Rogers, what an honor. They're ready. Jacqueline, I just want to say I truly respect you as a director, but as an actress, you have inspired me since I was a little girl. Oh, isn't that exactly what one always wants to hear. But you look fatigued. Would you like to go to the hotel? Oh, no. I'm fine. Please, come around our little campfire. How exciting. Hey, you. I saw that. You're fired. She said it was okay. Oh. It's really no big deal. Bye-bye. Thirty seconds. [speaking German] Brian! Come over here! You have to meet your darling Nicky. Tsar Nicholas. Your bride. I can't believe you just got off a plane. I'm Brian. Olivia. Background! [shouting in German] Um, Jacqueline. Not the best time, Jack. In the meeting, we discussed that this is the second burial. The bodies are already burnt and mutilated. It was hasty. It's spontaneous. How can the hole already be there? I'm sure we'll get letters from everyone who was there. Background! But we want it to be right, don't we? Would you like to watch some people dig a hole in the ground? Action! [muttering inaudibly] [no audible dialogue] ♪♪♪ Fire in the hole! [shouting in German] ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ [wind howling] Oh, this is beautiful. Uh, I'm sorry. My English is a little... - I love it. - Oh. Sweet dreams. [bed creaking] [sighs] [ring] [ring] Hello. WOMAN: Fraulein Rogers? Yes, this is she. The director would like to see you in the bar. Now? [line clicks, dial tone] [woman speaking German] [speaking German] May I help you? I didn't mean to interrupt. I'm looking for the bar. - The bar? - Yes. I'm supposed to meet Jacqueline Girard in the bar. There is no bar. Really? Is there a bar nearby? In town. Let me get a map. Wait. Can you just ring her room? Hmm. I'm very sorry, but she has a block on the line. She's long asleep. Oh. Well, never mind, I guess. Very good, then. Sweet dreams. [phone ringing] [speaking German] [sighs] [knocking] [knocking] Just a minute! Hello. Look, this is a special role. You're getting all the money they have. It's just weird. My room had no flowers, fruit basket, nothing. Not even a note. And honestly, it's hideous. I will call them in the morning. Then someone wakes me in the middle of the night with new pages for tomorrow, and runs away by the time I open the door. And I'm looking at it, and it's for Episode 6. No one told me we were starting with the last episode. That's the most exciting one. You got the murders. The investor will be excited when he visits. Is there a problem with the money? Don't act like you've never shot out of order before. How's Frenchie? Jacqueline? She was nice. I just didn't feel like she was that thrilled to have me. She's intimidated. She's trying to be a director. She's got to remind you of that. You are a godsend to that woman. Just look in the mirror. You're amazing. Are you doing it? You're amazing. You're just saying that because you have to. I'll tell you how amazing you are. I just flew back from New York on a private jet, thanks to you. No client wants to hear that, Bob. You're allowed to be nervous. It's the first day of school tomorrow. That's why you do what you do, and I do what I do. I guess you're right. I'm always right. Go to bed. Love you. I love you, too. Thanks, Bob. [line ringing] Hi. It's Cathy. I probably can't find my phone, but I'm happy to hear from you. Leave a message. [beep] ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ [engine running] Hi. Good morning. Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm a little jet-lagged. ♪♪♪ It's so beautiful here. Uh... Oh, it's so beautiful here. [in German] I am sorry. I don't understand English. ♪♪♪ Thank you so much. Thanks, God. I feel like it's a little plain. There's a bolero waistcoat. This looked so bad on the girl before you. Rebecca? She was starving to death. Skeleton. It's probably why she quit. I thought she was fired. You're perfect. - Bonjour. - Bonjour. Ah. Look how much better this is. I want you to meet everyone. Samuel, come meet Olivia. Samuel! Oh. Olivia. I'm so excited to meet you. I'm not gonna lie. Other than Jacqueline, you're most of the reason I'm here. You know, I threatened to walk if they didn't get you. Oh. You're her. You're my queen. My goodness. Beautiful. Rasputin, Alexandra. So, we're going to take this gently. - I know the pages are new. - No problem. Where's Lazlo? Over here, Madame. He shot me many times. You'll be happy. Shall we? Quiet on rehearsal! [shouting in German] Whenever you're ready. Your Holiness, these long months of separation have been a mistake. And who turned you against me? Blah, blah, blah. Then I go here. I, uh... I'm gonna go over here. Do you want to go over here or over there? I'm not sure. Okay. Cut! Let's get everybody camera ready, and we'll try it again with the lens. MAN: 43/1, Take 1, A-mark. B-mark. Action! [knocking] Enter. Your Holiness. These long months of separation have been a mistake. I pray you can undo our misfortune. Empress, we cannot speak with the doors open. Very well. [door closes] You are bitter that we ignored you. I know not who poisoned you against me. I have no thoughts other than the prince. My child. And I will throw myself off a parapet unless I know he will live to be tsar. Pray with me. I shall in time. On your knees! If I join you there, the servants will talk. Can you not put your hands on the soul of my son and leave mine be? - Coupez! - MAN: Cut! Very good! Moving on! Uh... Jacqueline. Um, excu-- Excuse me, Jacqueline. MAN: Anastasia, Olga, and Nicholas for rehearsal in the playroom set. Excuse me. I was just warming up. Oh, that's fine. Is there no coverage? No, there are two cameras, dear. Two. And you're happy with that? If I wasn't happy, I wouldn't move on. Well, I would like another take. It's my first day, my first shot. What does that have to do with me? I don't know how to say this, but I really respond to praise. That was wonderful. This is exactly what television needs-- another period piece with well-dressed mannequins. Excuse me? You haven't seen Rasputin in a year. You parted in scandal. Your little boy is dying with hemophilia. But there was no rehearsal. If I had known that... You would have given a better performance? You know what I did to get this series? This is my family's story, and you walk through it. It doesn't mean anything to you. Of course it does. Being an empress is more than walking around in a costume with your nose in the air. I promise, I'll do my job if you do yours. [chattering] Samuel. Can I talk to you? This is fucked up. I can't work that way. You are stronger than you think you are. Well, can you at least run lines with me? Meet me outside the castle at 7:00. You mean the hotel? Okay. Thank you, Rasputin. Oh, Jesus Christ. ♪♪♪ Thank you. [engine starts] - Hello, there. - Hey. So I assume we're going to dinner. I left my script upstairs. ♪♪♪ Are you working? MAN: We're rolling. Lock it up! [speaking German] Action on car! Action! Action! I still can't believe they had cars. [grunting] [grunting] That's me. Lovely. [grunting] They lure me that night to Felix's palace. I was supposed to meet his most beguiling wife. We listened to jazz as they fed me cakes and wine laced with cyanide, and then they tried to make me sing. Two hours passed, but I was nothing more than drunk. So they shot me in the chest. I ran, gasping, to the courtyard. They chased me. Shot me in the back, and then hit me in the head with a brass ornament. I dropped to my knees, and then they shot me in the head point blank. [grunting] The Neva River was frozen, and when they pulled my body out, there was water in my lungs. I drowned. Cut! Going again! Oh. Dead body gets another take. We should go and get our scripts. ♪♪♪ Thank you for sharing this. I can't get enough of this shit. ♪♪♪ [choir singing on stereo] Beer? Absolutely. [singing continues] "It rubs the lotion on its skin." This is elaborate. Well, flea market. I've only got one chair. [volume lowers] Cheers. Nazdarovya. Hmm. I really don't like running lines. Me, neither, but it's the job, right? I love this kind of script. It's flat. It's all about the physical. I didn't come here to be directed. Stand up. You first. You're afraid. I'm really not. I'm under your spell. [electricity buzzes] [windows clattering] [wind howling] [electricity buzzes] [wind whispering] Script. See you at work. So we both agree that this is location dependent, right? Oh, shit. Really? I was gonna call my mum. [Jacqueline in French] No, shut up! This is unbearable. But why can't you accept my version of the facts? Me, I know it really happened. Accept my version of the facts. Listen to a survivor! All night you've been irritating me with this. You are dead and I am alive. No. No, I am sorry. No, no, death is not a word we should use here. That's not important at all, and the way you're talking is making me- What did I have to eat? Oh, chicken. And it was very good over there. Mm-hmm. It was delicious. Two sugars, Nicky? No maid. How domestic you are when you know I'm vexed. I know you bear the weight of all the world. What be it for a wife if not to lessen your load? And frankly, I'll not have the ears of the house share our intimacies, darling. And why not? They know all there is to know. This letter... claims that you are under Rasputin's spell, that he's turning the armies and ministers against me, against God's own emissary on Earth. Who wrote it? Nicholasha? The one who called me a German bitch and Alexei a weakling? You take his word over your queen. What am I to say, Alex, when you ask me how I take my tea? You are done with Rasputin. You will see him no more. And that is final. Cut! Uhh! Fucking sword. [growling] Brian, you have such a beautiful voice. But? But I need to feel your strength. Okay. But how strong is he? Hell, look what happened. Oh, he is strong. Do you think the tides of history are just? This is a man raised in a solid gold bassinet. Every whim met or exceeded. He had never heard the word "no," or even been addressed by name outside his family. Okay, so he's spoiled. But, I mean, it's Rasputin. Look at him. Look at her. Your wife. Oh, I get it. So he's afraid of her. [groaning] [groans] You are God's own emissary on Earth, and someone is fucking your wife, and he's dirty and filthy, and his cock is bigger than yours! So what are you going to do about it? [crew members murmuring] Use the jewels of Russia, or I will take them! [grunts] Be a fucking man! [sighs] I cannot play all the parts. Back to 1! [shouting in German] [exhales] Uh-uh. Okay, roll sound. [speaking German] 20/1, take 2. A-mark. B-mark. And action. Two sugars, Nicky? We're caught in a trap. I can't walk out. ♪ Because I love ya ♪ ♪ Too much, baby ♪ ♪ Why can't you see ♪ ♪ What you're doing to me ♪ ♪ When you don't believe ♪ ♪ A word I say? ♪ ♪ We can't go on together ♪ ♪ With suspicious minds ♪ ♪ And we can't build our dreams ♪ ♪ On suspicious minds ♪ Cut! That was perfect! Oh! Moving on. [laughing] Mm-mm! ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: New deal, people. [speaking German] [phone beeps] [male automated voice: German] Austria Telecom is unable to complete your call. ♪♪♪ [sighs] [goat bleats] [dance music playing, faint] [music grows louder] What would you like? I'd like to know why you told me there was no bar the other night. My English isn't very good. Your English is good. And not only is this a bar, but you're the bartender. I'm sorry for the confusion. Let me get that right away. [chattering, laughing] We're all very happy you're here. I mean, I didn't order... You know what? Thank you. Hey! Hello. Have a seat. You scared away the birds. Thank you. Cheers. I know you just lost your mother. It must be a very hard time. But you made the right choice to work. And you know, Alexandra is afraid of losing everything. Use that. That's very kind of you. Everyone's been very nice. A beautiful woman comes along, and suddenly everyone is on their best behavior. You know that better than anyone. [laughs] That's very sweet, darling, but you don't need to bother. What do you mean? I did the same thing when I was younger. Younger than you. What are you talking about? You fucked the director on your last job, and you're already fucking the male lead on this one. This is bullshit. Everyone knows. It's obvious and it's boring. Come. Sit. I understand. You don't want to give yourself over, so you take the easy way out. I've tried. You either don't react, or you react like a crazy person. I've been acting since I was 18 years old. Mm-hmm. And you keep using the same tricks. Did you ever think that maybe you're a great actress and a terrible director? Very good. Where was this person hiding? It's nice to have a pretty face, but that's not what Alex was known for. In fact, you're far too beautiful to play her. She was cunning and intelligent and powerful. You fuck everyone to avoid putting your whole self into the role. But surprise! You can't fuck me. So you're going to have to do your job. I'm sorry you're too old to play this part. It must be hard to watch the parade go by. [scoffs] [ring] Hello. SAMUEL: What are you doing? Getting ready for bed. Do you want to stop by for a visit? No. I'm kind of working tonight. Well, don't let it jam you up. Whatever you're doing is the way you do it. That's exactly what she said. [sighs] Look, Jacqueline's into reality, and it's extreme. She's in touch with something. She sees things that... fuck, that we're all trying to hide. She's cruel. Ah, that's because you know what she's saying is true, and there's no safety net. Well, I appreciate the call and the thought, but I'm staying in. ♪♪♪ Sweet dreams, Empress. ♪♪♪ [door opens] [door closes] Hello? Hello? [wind whispering] Excuse me. [gasps] Ohh! [gasps] [shrieks] Aah! ♪♪♪ Olivia. What are you doing here? Your costume's in your trailer. Did someone bring this back this morning? That's for Part 1. We haven't even used it yet. Why? It's that gasoline smell. Ah, it's benzene from the dry cleaning. Can you believe they still use it? It's so toxic. Who has keys to this trailer? Just me. Well, I got in here. Is everything okay? [sighs] Hey. Good morning, everyone. Quiet on rehearsal. We're actually rehearsing, right? [chuckles] Absolutely. So, Olivia, I see you here kneeling. Samuel, you can come from the back, hopefully as in the script. Action. Ahem. You've not been summoned to my palace. This is the Lord's house, not yours. You have come here because I am alone, but look at the walls. The saints are watching. If it is their will, I'll leave, Empress. It is my will. I won't blaspheme He who is above, but I feel possessed by a thousand devils and must worship at your temple. Cut! Wonderful. Quickly, quickly prepare them so we don't lose this magic. Can I get a lens? 34/1, take 1, A-mark. [chatter] Silence! Hold the work! Stop the Arbeit! Action! You have not been summoned to my palace. This is my house! Not yours. This is the Lord's house. You've come here because I'm alone. Look at the walls. The saints are watching you. If it is their will, I shall leave, Empress. It is my will. I will not blaspheme He who is above. But I feel possessed by a thousand devils, and must worship at your temple. Ohh! Ohh! What are you doing? I will have you killed. Stop it. No, Empress. You shall die of ecstasy on my sword. Not here, absolutely not. You are a Satan. Then you must love Satan. [gasping] You're hurting me. [groaning] You're fucking crazy. JACQUELINE: Cut! Check this. [phone beeping] [beeping] I don't know. Where the hell am I supposed to get Chinese food around here? I need a landline. [in German] I'm sorry, but I don't understand anything you're saying. Let me get someone to help you. I just heard you fucking speaking English! I'm sorry. They told me not to talk to you. Just get out and give me the phone. Okay. Okay. I'll get you out of there. Calm down. He ripped my costume. - Who? - Samuel, in the scene. He assaulted me. What? But it's really that crazy fucking bitch Jacqueline. She said these shitty things, and she lets everyone do whatever they want to do, except for me. Well, she's known as a tough director. Oh! And the weirdest thing. There was a little girl in my room last night. She looked like a ghost, and she smelled like gas, and she climbed into my armoire, and then it opened, and she was gone. Olivia, are you being good? The last thing I need is another client in rehab. No, Bob. This is a total mind fuck. It's been nonstop, and I'm done. I don't care what reason you give them. - You get me out of it. - Okay, okay. I told you... I can do that. I just want to tell you the hard facts here. I don't care. Okay. Well, this is new for you. Because this is international television, not a film, your star power, just your name alone has guaranteed the money, so if you walk, they'll find someone else, but you'll basically be uninsurable. And I'm not saying it's career ending because I never say that, but you're throwing away everything we've been working for-- financial clout and a serious part with a real director. I'll give them the money back. So you don't want to work anymore. I don't know what to do. Yes, you do. I know this is about your mom, and I'm not taking it lightly, but... Is this what she would want? Would she want losing her to mean you losing everything? ♪♪♪ Are you there? Yeah. I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Meryl. You have three things to do as an actress, and it's not that hard-- learn lines, hit your marks, and diet. ♪♪♪ Go have a couple of drinks. Just a couple. And remember who you are. You have another week, and then you get a little hiatus. Capri, maybe. It's an hour away. ♪♪♪ Okay. All right, that's my girl. Goodbye. [knock on door] I really don't want to see you. No, no. I need to apologize. Can I? What the fuck was that? I know there are no fucking laws here, but I should take you to court. You are absolutely right. I don't know what came over me. I'm... God, I'm spending too much time in this guy's head. Great. So you blame it on The Method? What if I had gotten hurt? I would never hurt you. And honestly, you were fucking amazing. I mean it. I'm sorry. I'm just... I feel like I'm losing my mind here. I know. It's really a lot. No, not just on set. What do you mean? - And how many glasses of wine? - No. She was wearing a fucking Victorian little girl dress which was on the costume truck this morning. I would like to explain it away because I don't know what's worse, if it's real, or if I'm imagining it. Okay. Well... maybe it has a false back. Don't open it! Be gone! [knocking] Seems solid. So I'm crazy. [chuckles] Well, these are Rebecca's. It's weird it's still full. Why? She OD'd. Why wouldn't she take them all? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. She OD'd? Yeah. Tried to kill herself. And they put me in her room? It's a great room. Well, you totally know the type-- fragile, former child star, anorexic, fresh out of rehab. Her father was her manager, and her husband's older than him. And then she met Jacqueline. I hate to tell you, but half of what she was so upset about was that you were the first choice and you turned it down. My mother had just passed away. Oh. Uh... I'm so sorry. I didn't know. Don't pull shit like that on set. Promise. [phone rings] [ring] [ring] This is she. Oh, yes. I forgot. You know what? I'm not feeling well tonight. I'm going to stay in. Please send my regrets. Who was it? Some fucking dinner in town. Oh, shit. What? It's dinner with the investors. We have to go. No, we don't. It's the money. We got to sing for our supper. [sighs] ♪♪♪ -Hey. -Hi. Sorry. I see you two have made up. Hey. Thanks. Steve Lewis and his wife Katrina. They're from Palm Beach-- Stephen via Akron, Ohio, and Katrina via Moscow. His family money comes from auto parts, but don't bring it up. [engine starts] We are here for the private party. It should be under the name Romanov. But of course. ♪♪♪ What's he doing here? He's the muscle. ♪♪♪ - Jackie. - Stephen. You look radiant. Mm. I feel terrible taking you away from the set. Oh. Nonsense. It's our pleasure. You know Olivia, of course. I have always wanted to. They snuck me some dailies. I mean, for the most part, I'm hands off, - but I just had to-- - He's in love. You must be Katrina? - Yes. - Samuel Bottom. Wow. You're a very big drink of water. And this is Lazlo, our cinematographer. And this is Brian Sedgwick. Oh. Tsar Nicholas. Yes. Steve, great to see you again. Absolutely. Fan-fucking-tastic. Why don't we sit down and get some champagne in here? Olivia, over there next to Stephen. Samuel, here. Ah, with pleasure. Oh. [chuckles] You're more polite than Rasputin. That's not true. [giggles] [laughter, chattering] ♪♪♪ But you're already so successful. What drives you? I am a gambler. Now, the movie business, well, I don't have to tell you. It's irrational from a financial standpoint. Well, you must be artistic yourself. I leave the hard work to the magic people. I mean, sure, Jacqueline knows I might step in around the rough cut, pop the hood, poke around, but just as your average audience member. His taste is exquisite. No. You know, when I was growing up, Rasputin was like the boogie man. Children nightmares. [both laughing] Do you think he was misunderstood? I think that he talked to God, and no one would listen. He helped the prince. That's true. Are you related to them? The Romanovs? Oh, no. Everyone says that. But no one really is. [gasps] Oh. [laughing] OLIVIA: Spooky. BRIAN: I can't see my wine. [laughter] Fire in the hole. Please accept our apologies. We have been having power outages. The chef is sending complimentary dessert. Mm. Well, this is even better. [chuckles] Well, this is a romantic look. Cheaper than a face-lift. [laughter] You know, I heard Kubrick shot all of "2001" with candlelight. Am I wrong, Lazlo? [gasping] What's wrong? Jacqueline? Oh. She's choking. [gasps] Uh... Emperatrizia... Maria. [in Russian] You must help me. You must save my family. STEPHEN: What the fuck? Jacqueline, look at me. We got to get a doctor in here. [in Russian] I understand. Talk to me! I am the Dowager Empress Marie, - She says she's the Dowager Empress Marie. - Dagmar of Denmark, Maria Fyodorovna, widow of Alexander the Third... [Katrina translates] ...mother of Nicholas the Second, Emperor of all the Russias. You must save them. You must save my grandchildren. All of them, Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia and my sweet baby Alexei. Don't let them murder my babies. Don't let them pierce their hearts with bullets and bayonets! Don't let them mutilate their beautiful bodies. They're burning. They're burning! You must stop them. I curse you if you let them die! Me? What did I do? What did she say to you, honey? She cursed me. I want to go. Stephen, I want to leave. - [neck cracks] - [gasps] - Jacqueline? - KATRINA: I want to go. I want to leave! Stephen, let's go! [gasps] Aah! Jesus Christ. Oh! Shall we go with you? We should get Jacqueline to a hospital. Absolutely not. [Jacqueline speaking German] Give me the keys. Give me the keys! I'm going to go make sure she's okay. You're working yourself too hard. I know. Thank you. It must feel very real to you. I know it's your family's story. That's a lie. What? I just said it to get the job. And you learned Russian, too? I don't speak Russian. Well, you did tonight. I spoke Russian? Really? Maybe you should go to a doctor. It sounds like you blacked out. I can't. I'll lose my job. [whispers] I'm a woman. Why do we even do it? I was born in Paris, the youngest of five... at a bad time for my mother. It was always a bad time for my father. How they fought to ignore me. So I talked to myself in the mirror. Took off my clothes until they noticed me. To become someone else, deserving of the eyes of strangers. Then I found myself in the closet, waving at some blinding sparkle of cameras so wide I couldn't see beyond them. I was 12 when some guy in a mall asked me to model. I couldn't believe I got money just to stand there. And then I toured the world, drinking champagne. The world is my hotel room, and I never pay. And finally I got a shoot in New York. Famous photographer. And we were shooting in this warehouse that had reminded me of a book I read. And I started to tell him, and he told me to shut up. And then I started acting. Dumb girl parts. But at least I could talk. ♪♪♪ And then I succeeded. And everyone wanted to know what I had to say. Maybe I don't have anything to say. I do. I'm defiant. I will be seen. [chuckling] I live for them, the audience. How sad they are, how scared they are. But maybe it's no better as the... the director. You play with these chess pieces, and you cannot make them look at you. You cannot be less alone. You're not alone. I'll do what you want me to do. Good night. Sweet dreams. [door closes] [Samuel laughs] SAMUEL: I would like to thank the Academy for this prestigious award, and to my asshole father for ignoring me, and to my icy-cold witch of a mother. Samuel! You talking to me? Hey, I'm walking here. ♪♪♪ [snoring] Morning. Sorry to wake you. Is Samuel coming? No. They shot him. What? They shot him out. He's wrapped. When? We had to get him to the airport while they brought the helicopter for the investor's wife. Really? Is she okay? No. Her heart stopped. She turned blue. She almost died. I thought she just fainted. She was frightened. Almost to death. I don't think that's possible. Are we waiting for someone? Is Jacqueline coming? Because if we can't get a fan in here and turn off these lights, I'm gonna step out. [man speaking German] I got dragged out of makeup because I heard everyone was waiting. Where's Jacqueline? Uh... Always in my fucking chair. Hmm. I don't know. Do you know Samuel wrapped last night? Oh, he did? Yeah. He didn't even say goodbye. Wow. He ghosted us. I would text him, but my phone doesn't fucking work. Oh, God. Why does she have to make it so hot in here? I know. I'm an actor. I know how to pretend. Hmm. Well, clearly she's lost it, between Hurricane Katrina last night and the new pages. New pages? Oh, you didn't get these? Ahem. The Dagmar whatever, Empress Marie, the grandmother, sends a boat from England to rescue us. What the fuck? We don't die? Yeah. Late last night she fired the writer, and changed the ending. So she wants to do a Romanovs story with no murder. Ha. It's a joke. That's the only thing anyone knows about them. Yeah. I mean, maybe people will like it. It's a happy ending. No, Brian, we will be laughed at. [door closes] [dramatic music] Good morning, everyone! Look at this beautiful family portrait. Jacqueline, do you have a sec? Just a minute, dear. Lazlo! You've been waiting here in the House of Special Purpose, deprived of contact, choked by heat. We move from Alexei across the despondent faces until we reach the royal couple and Nicholas reads the telegram. Then your faces fill with hope. Nicky? [grunts] Ahem. [sighs] "My children, don't fret. "My nephew, King George, "is sending a ship to Sebastopol to rescue us. "We shall live on, as God intends us. Your loving mother, Empress Marie." Alexandra, we're saved. I'm done. Jacqueline, you know my heart goes out to you, but I'm afraid I cannot be a part of this piece of shit. ♪♪♪ I told you that I was not going to let you ruin this. I didn't just marry a king. I made one. You were not born a Romanov. You don't understand. I do whatever it takes so we carry on. I would not let them die. I have to go. You were never good enough for my son! Alexandra's stepping out! [speaking German] [speaking German] What's going on? We're shutting down. What? When? I don't know. I'm a PA, okay? Well, I need a phone. Now. Nothing's working. You'll have to go into town. Then I'll need a ride. Obviously, transportation's busy. [speaking German] [men chattering] [speaking Russian] ♪♪♪ [men shouting] [classical music] Olivia, we're about to shoot. They were looking everywhere for you. I'm not going back there. Your agent is here. Really? Bob. - There's the star. - [laughing] [chuckling] Hey, Jacqueline has just been raving. Do you know that Bob was the first one to get me a Hollywood picture? I saw her at Cannes, and I said, "She can work anywhere." But then he lost interest. Never. To this day, every script Julianne Moore gets has your fingerprints on it. I've never heard of her. [laughing] Can I talk to you? Don't go far. We're about to shoot. Apparently, they've shut us down, so I don't even know how she's shooting. I know. She's clearly off her rocker. That's why I'm here. So everything's okay, right? I'm walking out that door. The way I figure, we're gonna create a narrative where Jacqueline just couldn't handle a project at this level. So she broke under the pressure. [sniffles] Thank you. - Thank you. - Okay. Go straight back to your room and pack. We'll leave first thing in the morning. I'll take care of this. [mouthing words] [mouthing words] [soft violin music] [pounding on door] MAN: We're leaving! Great. Just... Just a minute. [pounding] Open the door! - What? - Open the door. We're leaving. Can you give me a minute? You have to come with us. You're taking me to the airport, right? Come on. Now! I have to change. Give me a minute. Let go of me. We are leaving. No! Get your hands off me! [gun cocks] What is going on? You are not allowed to do this. Did someone talk to Bob? This is not funny! [engine running] Just get in the truck. I am warning you right now this is going to be the biggest fucking lawsuit of your life! Shut up! Please stop. What am I supposed to do? Aah! What are they doing? What is the meaning of this? Shoot them! [gasps] [screaming] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] JACQUELINE: Cut! Whoo! [applause] Thank you, everyone! That was great! WOMAN: Yeah. Nice job. Oh, that was just so-- I'm sorry, Olivia. I know what you want to hear. You were wonderful. Honey, it was worth it. Olivia, you're going to win an award. Olivia. Olivia. [woman screams] Medic! ♪♪♪ [female singer vocalizes]
