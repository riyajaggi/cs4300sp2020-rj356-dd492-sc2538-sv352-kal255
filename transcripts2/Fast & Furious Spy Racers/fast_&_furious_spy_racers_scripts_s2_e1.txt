 [Frostee humming] Oh... [grunts] Did you bring the hard drive? Did you bring the cash? First the hard drive. You thought I was going to bring that here? [chuckles] You were right not to trust me. [whirring] [man] You should have brought more muscle. No. You should have. [rhythmic electronic music plays] -[Echo ululates] -[man grunts]

 [grunting, groaning] I’m going after him! [grunts] [grunts] [train horn blares] [yells, grunts] He took the bait. Tech guy, I want to hear that conversation now! I have a name... Just... don’t. [man] It’s me. I couldn’t stop them. We’re compromised. Get the hard drive out of the city immediately! We’ve flushed them out. [exhilarating music plays] Looks like the old SH1FT3R crew has a new gig. Let’s get that hard drive. You gonna join us or what? We’re about to do some spy racing! Yeah, I’m on my way. [watch beeps] [grunts] Show-off. We've been practicing that move for two months. [Tony] I had to do it! She likes shoving you out of planes. Yeah, probably. [lively pop rock plays] ♪ I'm on a wave, on a cloud On my game, jump around ♪ Janey Mack! Everyone split up! Don’t let them get away. We need that hard drive! ♪ The doctor told me I'm crazy Insane in my brain ♪ ♪ My brain got no membrane Me be legally insane ♪ [music continues under roar of engines] [Tony grunts] First I blind ‘em, then I grind ‘em. [Tony] Whoa! [Bonegrinder groans] [yells] [music stops] [pop music plays] [Echo] Oh, no. [horn blares] [truck horn sounds] [strains] Whoo-hoo! [strains] Yeah! [Touge-Dori yelps, groans] -[whimpers] -[pop music stops] [hip-hop plays] [Frostee] We almost got her! [both yelp, groan] [Cisco and Frostee scream] I can’t believe your moms let you be a spy! [shakily] I know, right?! And it was easier than you would think! It’s time we leveled with you. I’m a government agent and your son is working as a spy. Ha! I knew it! [chuckles] Pay up. When I saw Vegas blowing up, I knew it was Frostee. -[Frostee screaming] -[Cisco] Hang on! -[deafening bass plays] -[Cisco and Frostee groan] It’s too much bass! Time to adjust the EQ. Woofer, meet subwoofer. [loud throbbing] [speakers crackle] [crashing] [music fades] Find the hard drive? -[Echo] It’s not Touge-Dori. -[Cisco] It’s not The Woofer. -[Tony] We’re missing... -[Ms. Nowhere] PizzaRave! She snuck away. Looks like a helicopter is heading to her. [Ms. Nowhere] We need to get to her before that helicopter. [tense music plays] [music intensifies] [alarm sounds] [winch whirs] -[alarm sounds] -[groans] [both grunt] Give it up, PizzaRave! Not going to happen, Tony! [gasps, grunts] No! [gasps] [both grunt] -[PizzaRave screams] -No! I got you! [grunts] [PizzaRave screams, grunts] Ha! Did someone order a PizzaRave? You said that? What did she say? Nothing. She didn’t know PizzaRave. Anyway, nice job team! With the coordinates on that hard drive, we found the stolen goods and broke up a really big smuggling ring! [all whoop and cheer] [heavy knocking] Uh, did you guys hear that? [all exclaim] [panting] [groans] You guys okay? What was that? I thought it was contraband in these containers. What’s with that tattoo? [Gary] Some tattoos reveal gang affiliations... and sometimes... they’re just cool. Zip it, Gary! Get him in the car! What’s going on? Nothing concerning you. Forget it. Okay, just some advice: if you want someone to forget about something, don’t tell them to forget about it. [mellow music plays] [grunts] [yelps, groans] Dang! So close. [Tony] Hey, looking good, Echo! Gather round. I have something to tell you. Is it about that tattooed man we found in the container? -No, it's not. -What did you find out? Who is he? -What’s his link to the smugglers? -Why was he in a container? Maybe cheap travel. Airlines take advantage every chance they get. Paying for a bag... Who travels without a bag? Would everyone just please stop talking?! This guy may be linked to international criminals trying to set up in Brazil, so-- We’re going to Brazil for an international investigation?! [all whoop and cheer] No! I was going to say, Interpol has it from here. -[all groan and boo] -[groans] Why is it every time an investigation leads out of LA, we lose the assignment?! Because you don’t know about international investigations! Then let us go to Brazil and learn about them! No. I’m not going to lose another agent down there. -Wait, what? You lost an agent? -Never mind! I'm not here to talk about the tattooed man or investigations, I came to tell you that I’ll be off on assignment for a while. -What do we do when you’re gone? -I don’t know, take a break. Do some things you used to do before you were a spy. I can’t do what I used to do. My car’s getting repaired. [gasps] You know what? I might be able to pull some strings and get a vehicle for you. Huh?! What do you think? It’s the spy van! Don’t say I never did anything for you. That’s the saddest spy van I’ve ever seen. You’ve never spent a month in the back eating barbecue sunflower seeds waiting for a dead drop that never happens. Man, it’s sadder than we thought. Van life, Tony. Embrace it. [instrumental music plays] -[man] Move your van, moron! -[car horn sounds] Tony! Whattup, dawg? You making a delivery, or is that your new ride? It's, uh... It's my new ride. Sweet! I have the same van! Toretto! It's been too long. Whatcha been up to, man? Well... Nothing, I guess. Nothing except driving the same sweet van as me! We should totally get a van selfie. Should've been here yesterday! There was this crazy chase through the city and some dude jumped out of a helicopter! It was amazing! Yeah. Sounds amazing. [engine roars] [rock music plays] ‘Sup, losers? The Mitch is back! I’ll let you guys talk vans. I’m gonna check out Mitch’s sweet ride. Talk about a winner! [cameras click] Hey, it’s five bucks apiece for those pics, and no touching my car! [groans] Are you going to the van rally next week? All the vans are gonna be out in the desert: Little Granny Vanny, the Van Trap Family, Van Go, Tall Dark and Vansome, Van Halen, The Vanhattan Project, The Vanatee, The Last Van Standing, The Vanicurists... This came for you. All right, finally! A flower? Are you going to prom or something? I’m figuring out a formula I saw tattooed on a guy’s arm, if you must know. Nah, I don’t care. I discovered that the formula creates a synthetic version of a compound found in the Pimenta do Diabo flower, like this one! They’re super rare! Not interested. Having the flower might help me understand the synthetic formula. I can’t believe I thought you were going to prom. -[door closes] -Time to get to work. [intriguing music plays] [liquid bubbles] Huh, nothing. Guess you can’t trust strangers’ tattoos. [yawns] -[Frostee snores] -[liquid fizzes] [gasps] [Frostee grunts] -[Frostee] Ow! -Frostee! You okay? I’m fine. Your hair is smoking. Don’t you have a government lab to blow up?! You’ll clean up this mess, and no whining about it. Clean up the mess. Okay, I’ll do that. Because I said s-- Wait. Did you just say you’ll do it? Yeah, I'll clean up the mess. Well that's a first. That boy has never willingly agreed to clean up anything. And why don’t you clean up the restaurant when you’re done in here? Clean the restaurant. I will do that. [squeals] We’re finally getting some respect around here. Guys, remember that weird tattoo we saw on that man’s arm? Yeah! The one that's a heart with a skull and dagger and birds and says “mom”? That was cool. No, Cisco, the tattoo on the tattooed guy from our bust. Oh, right... But that skull ink was dope. What is it? Find something out? Well, I did a little research, and I think one of his tattoos is actually a formula. A formula? For what? I’m not sure. I mixed it together and an hour later it blew up and rattled my brain. [Frostee] When I came to, I'd cleaned my room and the restaurant and combed the hair of all 52 of my sister’s mermaid-pony doll thingies! It was weird... Could this formula be for a weapon, or some rocket fuel? Maybe. We gotta tell Ms. Nowhere. [Julius] Great shot, but I’m not sure why my face is on it. And I’m not sure why you thought you could eat the last donut! -[groans] -[Julius] Those were mine... Good, you’re here. We think we have a lead on the container guy. -I told you to relax! -[Julius yells, crashes] It’s like everything I tell you to do, you do the opposite! Listen, Ms. Nowhere. We think that guy is important. Of course he is! The entire reason for the smuggling bust was to get him! You knew? I thought we needed the hard drive. That’s because that’s what I wanted you to think. Plus, you did stop a smuggling ring, so that’s good. You left us in the dark? Not cool. You know what else isn’t cool? Having my orders disobeyed all the time! Now if you don’t mind, I have a mission to get to. Wait! At least tell us what the formula is for. I tried to mix it, it almost took my eyebrows off. What formula? Frostee recognized the guy’s tattoo. Did you know it was a formula? Of course I knew! Bye! -Well, what is it for? -Bye! Gary, check his tattoos. What am I looking for? [Ms. Nowhere] One of them may be a formula. Okay, I’ll call you back. [grunts] Uh-oh. [grunts] [tense music plays] ...and then he just threw it away! I was like, “Hey, that’s the bottom nub, it’s full of all the best stuff!” So I pulled it out of the trash and ate it! Mm... What?! No! Not my car! -[music fades] -[phone rings] [Gary groans] Hello? Why haven’t you been answering?! Did you find anything? Umm... About that... -[groans] Gary! -He’s stronger than he looks! You’re a giant man! I know, but it’s not the dog in the fight, it’s the fight in the dog. Don’t! I don’t want to hear you speak right now. [strains, groans] -Maybe Tony and his team can help? -I said, don't speak! [doorknob rattles] Fine, but if we find him, you have to fill us in. I want to know everything. Fine, it’s a deal. Tell us the truth, you didn’t know about the formula, did you? Would you just get going?! [Frostee] There he is leaving the safe house. And here he is about twenty minutes later. No way! He took Mitch’s key car! [laughs] [Cisco] Look at Mitch throw a fit! -[all laugh] -[Mitch groans] Aw! [sobs] No... [groans] [laughs] Frostee, you got to play that again. No, we don’t have time... Okay, maybe just once more, real quick. [Frostee laughs] [alarms ring] [Frostee] A camera picked up the car near Mexico. How can we get to him? He has a huge lead on us. [panting] Y-You said Dom has done this before?! And lived?! At least you’re driving your car and not a stupid van. Stupid? We worked really hard on that new paint job. [Frostee] We’re almost to the key car. [Frostee] Opening door now. [engines rev] [Frostee] Here we go! [Tony yells] [Frostee and Cisco yell] Oh yeah! Whoo! [laughs] Whoo! [all scream] [yelps] I don’t like this! -[Cisco screams] -[Echo] Aw yeah! [rock music plays] [Cisco pants] [Echo] Aw, yeah! Whoo! Van life, dawg. Ten miles to the border! [Echo] It’s too fast! Here comes the sun! [yells] [man yelps, grunts] [strains] [music fades] [crowd cheers] [man] Tony! Yeah! Van life, bro! You’re livin’ it! Van life! [crowd chanting] Van life! Van life! We got your guy, now tell us about this investigation. Fine. A new weapon recently got smuggled into Rio. We’re still figuring out what it is, but rumor has it, it’s so powerful it could throw the entire world into chaos. Okay, vague but frightening... [Cisco gulps] We’ve been working with Interpol for months. We'd hoped this guy would shed some light on the situation. And the formula? We didn’t know about it until you told us. Haha! I knew it! Sorry, but I knew it. We figured out the tattoo was a formula and we caught this guy - twice. We should be the ones to go to Rio and do this investigation. We’re ready. I didn’t want you to go because the undercover agent I previously embedded in Rio... -was Layla Gray. -[Tony] Huh? [Cisco crunches] [Ms. Nowhere] I tracked down and recruited Layla myself. Her criminal past was the perfect cover. But now she’s gone dark. I don’t know if she’s blown her cover, turned bad, or worse. Layla is family. If she got in trouble, then we’ll find her and get her out. This is why I didn’t tell you. I knew nothing would stop you trying to get her back. But maybe that’s just what we need... Pack your bags and slap on the bug repellent, you’re going to Brazil.
