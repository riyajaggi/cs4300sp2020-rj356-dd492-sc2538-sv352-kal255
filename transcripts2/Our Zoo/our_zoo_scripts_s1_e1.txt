 Our Zoo (2014–…): Season 1, Episode 1 - Episode #1.1 - full transcript 
 In 1930 George Mottershead, still tormented by memories of the Great War, where his brother died, is collecting supplies from Liverpool docks for his father Albert's shop when he sees an abandoned monkey and parrot, which he brings home. He plans to sell Mortimer, the monkey, to a circus but instead ends up rescuing an elderly camel. Younger daughter June is thrilled by the menagerie in the backyard, other family members less so. Then George accidentally comes across the dilapidated Oakfield Manor in the village of Upton, which is up for auction. Encouraged by friendly aristocrat Lady Katherine Longmore George secures a bank loan and, assisted by Albert, who sells his shop, buys the manor with a view to turning it into a zoo without bars. The family moves into the manor but, despite support from his wife Lizzie, George's sour mother Lucy and elder daughter Muriel, are not impressed and matters are not helped when Mortimer escapes and creates havoc in the village store.

 Come on. "Our Zoo News. Edition One. "The first thing you need to know about animals is that they're "just like human beings only with much better manners. "I always knew my dad loved animals, but three months ago "we didn't even own a cat, let alone have space for a monkey." TYPEWRITER PINGS Me and your Uncle Stan saw an elephant first time we ever came to a circus. Will there be monkeys? Monkeys, lions, all sorts. Ah! Look, look!

 SHELLS AND BOMBS EXPLODE Dad? What's wrong? You're squeezing too hard. LIONS PURR Dad? Dad? CAR HORN TOOTS Got a surprise for you. I got it off a lad at work. What is it? Oh, you'll have to ask nicer than that. Blimey... I was thinking about New York. You're still in school. Not for long. And I'll have to get a job after, anyway. We could pay for our passage over by working. Yeah, all right. Dad, what's happened? Mew, inside. Christopher, go home. I said go home! What's going on? Do you want the whole street to hear? George, what's the matter? HE SOBS Eh? HE CRIES Are the girls all right? I didn't scare them, did I? They'll be fine. It's you I'm worried about. I'm sorry. What's wrong with me? Why can't I get past this? Other men do. You've got to give yourself time, George. It's been years, though. I'm sorry Lizzie, I'm sorry. We're still living here with my parents. All crammed in the house, I'm sorry. 'I thought he'd turned a corner.' But he's going backwards. I'm not sure he's ready to take this place on, love. He'll have to be. We've got plans. Let's just give him another year. Him or you? Everyone has to retire at some point, Albert. And we should be enjoying these precious last few years together. I'm not dead yet! If you don't slow down, you will be. Is he sick? No. People will think he's a lunatic if he carries on like that. Grown men don't cry. That's enough. He's your father. And he's going through something awful, and we're going to help him. Here you are. Everything all right with your George? Yeah, he's fine. He's just tired, that's all. You sure? He tore a right strip off of my Christopher. Scared him half to death. You remember Danny Robertson, don't you, Albert? Two streets over. Yeah, fought in the Somme? Came home, seemed fine. Now he won't even come downstairs. That's nothing like our George. Well, I'm just saying, shell shock creeps up on some men. Thank you, dear. What is it, Gran? It's the South Lancashire Regiment. Your Uncle Stan's company in the war. George's, too. Sit down, sweetheart. SHOP DOOR OPENS Only me. Good day, son? Not bad. Another reunion. You ought to go this time, for Stanley's sake, remind yourself how lucky you are still to be here. Lucy! You want to get a grip on yourself, George. That's enough. I beg your pardon, this is my house, and we've been tiptoeing around him far too long. There's nothing wrong with you, you're not injured. Your wounds have healed. I think what your mother is trying to say is that it might be better to air it out, son. Rather than keeping it bottled up. Well, there's nothing to say! I know I'm lucky, Mother. And I'm sorry that Stan's not here and I am. I'm sorry for that every day. Sorry that I shouted at Christopher, Mew. Why don't you invite him around for tea? Cos I'd die of embarrassment. Mew! Mew. Son! Let him go, leave him. SHOP DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES Eat up, love. Hey, I saw you looking at my shirt, pal. You like it? Cos I can get you half a dozen of these. Made by the same bloke who cuts cloth for the King. No word of a lie. Have a look at this. What the hell are they? Sunglasses from America. Stops you squinting on the beach and you can sneak a look at the ladies without the missus knowing. Have you ever used an electric razor? You'll never go back, my friend. Forget hot water and towels. Can you provide a bill of sale for them items, sir? Georgie! You scared the daylights out of me. How long have you been home? Couple of weeks. What are you drinking? Little tip for you, Georgie, if you're looking for a bit of excitement in your life... ..papayas. Right, what's that? Fruit. Had one last year in a restaurant in Boston. All the fashion. Docks are flooded with them and the best part is they're dirt cheap cos no-one knows what the hell to do with them. Take those off, will ya, Billy? Oh! Yeah. How's the shop? Yeah. Erm, Lizzie's doing a book-keeping course so we can take it over from my old man, you know? How is she - Lizzie? She's YOUR sister, Billy. Why don't you come with me and ask her yourself? You won't tell her you've seen me, will you? Why not? I just want to pick my moment. I'm a changed man. On my mother's sacred life. I just want her to see that. I don't know how you do it, Billy. You've always got a smile on your face. You're always moving on to something new. You going, then? I can't. A few drinks, couple of war stories. How hard can it be? You didn't even serve, Billy. Yeah, well, I'm just saying it might do you some good. I'll come with you, if you like. ALARM GOES OFF HUBBUB I'm told this is the future. Whatever you think, mate. Get a move on. Get a move on, then. That's it, that's it... In here. Come on! Come on, there's a good girl. KANGAROO SNORTS Come on, there's a good girl. Yes, sir, have you come to collect? No, no. I'm just, erm, just looking. That's a kangaroo, innit? Here, if you want to see something... Hey, look at that! Came in on a Navy boat from Australia. No-one ever bothered to pick him up. Yours for two bob. What would I want with a parrot? Fair question. There's a good lad. Easy now... Hey, what's in there? Monkey. Someone ships it all the way from Colombia and can't even be bothered to come and pick it up. There were two of them. Other one died. Took us a while to work out what to feed them. Trouble is we can't keep them forever. What's that stuff there? Chloroform. Trust me, it's the best way. He'll just drift off. All right. All right! All right, what? How much do you want? For the parrot or the monkey? Both. HE SIGHS Junebug. June! What did you buy? Pineapples? And a few other bits and bobs. What is it? That, that's a monkey. From Colombia. And this is a parrot. All the way from Australia. Where are they going to live? Must be some nuts in here. Try the top shelf. What were you thinking of? I couldn't leave them there. They just need feeding up, that's all. What about the smell in the meantime? What if that thing out there escapes? We've got customers. We're respected in this community. Don't worry, Gran, I'll make sure they stay in their cages. We're not keeping him, love. You're damn right we're not. There's a monkey in the... We know! Right. Looks exotic. What's wrong? I've just got work in the morning, that's all. It's my dad, isn't it? He won't hurt you. He's perfectly normal. There's something in there. It's lovely, is this, Mum. AGONISED SHOUT FROM OUTSIDE Bloody monkey scratched me! He's defending himself, that's all. Let me look, let me look. It's just a scratch is that. Why do you put up with this? All right, I'll find a home for him. I said I would. I couldn't just leave him there. I ought to charge admission! You're getting this for free. MEW PLAYS OUT OF TIME Mew, concentrate. SHE SPEAKS GIBBERISH We'll have men in white coats at the door if you carry on like that. June! Be careful, stop that. It's all right, Grandad, he won't hurt. I'll show you. He's strong, isn't he? What else have you taught him? Mortimer won't be happy in the circus, Dad. He's too shy. The bigger ones will bully him. Mortimer? You've given him a name? We've cleaned him up. He was very underweight. And now you want to get rid of him? Well, believe me if there was any other option, I wouldn't be here. Where is he? Right, well, he's over there, in the back of the... June, June! June, here you are. June, don't stand so close, love. CAMEL GROANS Is he ill? He's just old. You'd look like that if you'd been giving little 'uns rides on your back half your life. He'll be lion food soon enough. I'll take the monkey off your hands. His name is Mortimer. So, have we got a deal or not? CAMEL GROANS Good boy. Your gran is going to kill me. Mum, too. What are you going to do? Have you really got a monkey and all? Your George has finally cracked! CHILD: Oh, wow! Go on, then, nowt to be afraid of. Behold the beast! Wow! He looked right at me. He came from a Colombian rainforest all the way here. He can reach up to 22mph swinging through the trees. Tell them all about Sidney. Go on. Camels are 40 million years old. Not this actual one, of course. CAMEL GROANS You said you were going to get rid of them! Let's go inside, love. Why? You've invited everyone into our back yard, YOU made this public. Why not discuss it in front of all and sundry? CAMEL GROWLS I've tried to be understanding, to be patient. Give you a chance to get what you're feeling out of your system. All right. But this can't go on. Butterfield offered to take him but I couldn't do it. You should see the state of the animals he keeps at that circus, it's criminal. I can't do it. I'll find someone else to take them. Who? Someone. I mean, look at him, he's beautiful. Lethal! He scratched my son. Only cos he stuck his hand in his cage. He was standing up for himself. June, that's enough! Someone will take him. And the bird. And the camel? I can't believe I'm saying this. It's a camel, who wants him? Well, he's not feeling very well, so we'll nurse him back to health first. You're scaring me. What you're doing, it's not normal. Well, maybe it is. For me. PIANO PLAYS I love you. I'm trying, you know? Let's just go home. No, not yet. All right, Sis? Fancy seeing you here. What are you drinking? Did he put you up to this? # In the good, old summertime # In the good, old summertime # Strolling down a shady lane ♪ With my baby mine... ♪ Was your George really in a cage? Billy said he was paralysed almost. It wasn't a cage. They pinned his spine to keep it in place. Billy says they used to turn screws to try and straighten him out. It's amazing, you'd never know it to look at him. THEY FINISH SINGING Did you hear that, Lizzie? Them piano lessons Mum shelled out for us didn't go to waste now, did they? Unlike the small fortune she spent paying for your wedding. Wedding? Oh, don't worry, love, he's not married. Not our Billy. He's not the settling type. Billy, what's she saying? I'm saying he left a fiancee at the altar and a broken-hearted mother behind him while he disappeared for three years. I didn't mean to be gone that long. I'm glad you've changed your mind. Once you get talking to the other men, it'll all click into place. Here. CAMEL GROANS SHE SIGHS Right. We find a buyer for the animals. One quick drink. Then home. Easy as that, eh? Billy, you can sell a glass of water to a drowning man. Sweet of you to say so, Georgie. Here you are, is this it? I'm telling you we took a wrong turn at that last village. Hey! Where are you going? Hey! George! Georgie! Georgie! George, come on! What are you playing at? Come on! George. This ain't the place and you're late enough already. Get a move on! George! MEN CHAT And into battle. Hey. Here, you look like you need it more than I do. Thank you, Reverend. INDISTINCT Excuse me. HE BREATHES HEAVILY WOMAN: Here. Would you like one of mine? Thank you. I don't actually smoke any more but it's an old suit. I thought I might get lucky. HE COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS THEY LAUGH It's been a while. You'll pick it right back up. Oh, no, no, no. This is just to help me get through tonight, that's all. You're not cold, dressed like that? I'm warm-blooded. I just got back from Kenya. Oh, right. I'm lying low. Aye, me too. Are you not a fan of these reunions? First one I've been to, actually. I thought it might be a good idea after all this time but... ..it seems like such a waste, you know, to survive what we did, only to turn into a bunch of... Shadows? Yeah. Where are my manners? I'm George. Mottershead. Lady Katherine Longmore. Lady? Bloody hell. Nice place you've got here. Oh, it's not mine. Lord Ainslie is my uncle. Can I ask you a question? There's a place a few fields over that way. Oakfield? Isn't it gorgeous? It was used as a military hospital in the war. They left it in quite a state. What about the owner? Lost everything in the crash. Right. Apparently, a land agent from London's been sniffing about, waiting for the price to drop. Aye, it would have to drop quite a way to be in my price range, I'm sure. Shame. We'd be neighbours. I ought to be getting back. Milady. Mr Mottershead. Most men bow, you know. Well, I'm not most men. When you've risked everything, when you're face down, bullets and bombs, you realise life's for living. We've earned it, haven't we? We've earned a bit of luxury. Eh, allow me. Something exotic. Ain't that right, George? Er...yes. George has got this parrot, you see. Australian. Beautiful bird. Hell of a gift for the kids. Perfect for any office. What do you think, Fenchwood? I work in a bank. I like it quiet. Perfect, this bird does sums, you could put it to work. Sings arias. Billy! Call it a quid, we'll say no more about it. What unit did you say you were in? Let's just go, please. Well, I didn't actually ever enter the theatre of war itself. I, erm... Is there a problem, gentlemen? No. I think we've got a hanger-on, Reverend. Really? Well, perhaps we should ask you to... Hey! Hold on! My pal took a bullet in the neck for King and country. Billy, that's enough. Nah. He taught himself to walk. Three year it took. God's will is a remarkable thing. It wasn't God's will, it was mine. I only mean when so many perished, it's remarkable to have been chosen to survive. Chosen? Is that how it works? My brother died and he was twice the man that I am. There's no choice. Just luck. Cruel luck and plenty of it. Who are you exactly? I've never seen you at one of these before. First and last time. Excuse me. I've loaded the Westcott order on the van. So you can call in on them on the way to Miss Mosley. Right. How was the reunion? Sobering. I knew it would do you a power of good. Get shot of those animals and everything will get back to normal. Mr Mottershead! Can't keep away? Indeed, milady. What was it like - Africa? Oh, paradise. Leopards, ostrich, baboons. Right outside the window. Feels like a lifetime ago. What would you do with this place? What you said sounds good - wild animals, space. You can't let a little thing like finances stop you, you know. That's easy for you to say, milady. I've never had a penny to my name. But I find that money is rather like a flock of migrating birds. It will follow if you look like you know where you're going. SHE PLAYS: "Nocturne No 9" by Chopin SHE STOPS PLAYING That was amazing. How do you make a boy like you? I don't want you worrying about that kind of thing, not yet. I'm 15. You were that age when you met Dad. What was he like back then? Your dad? He always had these grand plans if that's what you mean. Always wanted to make something of himself. What happened? Life isn't always the way you dream it, Mew. You have to be grateful for what you've got. Afternoon, ladies. Oh! Well, if he won't get rid of them, I will. What does that mean exactly? Lucy, for pity's sake. Not like this. Mother? Go inside if you've not got the stomach for it. Mother! George? What's happening? What are you doing? What are you doing, Mother? You can't do this. You're driving us out of business, George! We've not had a customer for days! You leave me no choice! Tell him to put it down, Mother! Tell him, for God's sake! Here. Here. Go on, get out. Look what you're driving us to! What you're doing to this family! Just tell us what's in your head, son. Make us understand. Let me show you. The first time we've closed up early since the Coronation. People will cope. Uncle Billy! All aboard. Monkeys ride for free. Well, I'm not travelling in the back of that thing. This better be worth it. JUNE LAUGHS Right! Mother. How do? Whose house is this? No-one's yet. What are we doing here? Don't touch anything, June! That's it. Just over there, whack it on top of here. That's it. There you go. Right. This...is us. This house, I mean. Now I'm thinking this shed here, we pull that down and we rebuild, maybe an aviary. Right? Stables here and the greenhouse out the back - now, that is huge. There's ten acres of land all ready to be used as a paddock. It's perfect for animals. What sort of animals? Horses. Peacocks. Elephants. Elephants? You're off your rocker. George, what's going on? I want to build a zoo. But with no bars. No small cages. No walls. Of course we'll need something to draw people from miles around. A...erm...a main attraction. And this would be perfect for serving teas to visitors... once we fix it up of course. What do you think? The girls will get their own rooms, Lizzie. There's fields to run around in. Clean air. It's been good for me, helping these animals. George... I didn't tell you because I knew you'd try and talk me out of it. But...it's up for auction in three days' time and I'm told it's likely to go for less than it's worth, so it's an investment if anything. You've no money to buy it in the first place. I'll not sell the shop, son. No, no, no, Dad, no, I don't want you to. I want to be my own man, do this in my way. Well, we're here now, we might as well take a look at the place. Come down. Breathe that in. No, thank you. June would be happy here, and she'd learn a whole lot more with animals around her, and space. Mew would hate it. And besides, how would we ever afford it? Well, I find that money is rather like a flock of migrating birds... What's our profit and loss? Cash flow? You need to give a bank a complete set of figures to stand even an outside chance of a loan. Then help me. People like us don't do things like this. Lizzie, you've watched our neighbours paying money they can barely afford to look at things that they've never seen before. I think people need that escape, now more than ever. Then we need to make this about more than just figures. Find me a pen and paper before I change my mind. Hey, if my mum catches us... Friday. There's a boat leaves at nine o'clock. They're still looking for staff. You could do carpentry on board - mend doors, tables. Don't say anything now. I love you. I'm ready to be with you. If you still want me. Time to face the music. Right... ..so I have managed to get a meeting at a bank. I've done some work on a proposal and my suit's been pressed, so it's now or never. Do I go or not? I want everybody behind this. Fine, well, I'm going to say it because nobody else seems to want to. It's a lovely dream, son, but enough is enough. We're all agreed... No, we're not. I'm with George. Father, are you going to say anything? Yes. I am. George, I can't afford to help you. There you are, then. But I'm not going to stop you either, son. Albert Mottershead! What? We're not joined at the hip. I am entitled to my own opinion. June? Silly question, am I right? Fine. I don't care. Here you are. Are you all right? Come on. George Mottershead for Mr Fenchwood, please. Right, come on then. If I get this right, there won't be anything else like it in the world. George... And believe me, Mr Fenchwood, I've read enough to know it. And if I can't make it work within a year, I'll sell the house and I'll pay you right back. What if it's gone down in value by then? The stock market is crashing around our ears. Well, I don't know anything about that. That's what worries me. This is a lot of money you're asking for. I'm sorry but I can't make a decision based on sentiment. Help me put a bit of beauty back into the world, Mr Fenchwood. It's a disgrace the way we treat animals. Either stick them in cages to be stared at or we flog them half to death working for us. Men like us...we've seen enough suffering, haven't we? Look...I can't give you all of it. ã3,000 is my limit. I'm going to regret this, I just know it. Best investment you've ever made. CREAKING Where are you going? New York. New York? Keep your voice down. I need you to give this to Mum, OK? But not until later, do you understand? You look gorgeous. Be good, OK? Whatever happens, don't get carried away and bid too high. We've got a budget to stick to. What are they doing up there? Come on, we're going to be late! What's the matter? Where's Mew? You've driven her away. The New York boat, has it gone? Sailed five minutes ago. Why? My daughter was on it. What does she look like, your girl? Is that her? Christopher didn't show. His loss. I hate it round here. I hate knowing exactly what my life's going to be. Maybe it's time we all took a chance. Tried something new. The bid is with you, sir. 2,600. 2,600. Do I hear any advance on ã2,600? ..A stable added in 1886. It's a crime to let this go for so little. I didn't think you'd show. Is it over? All bar the shouting. A land agent from London wants it. He's outbid everyone else. Here! 2,700. Thank you, sir. 2,700 I am bid. Any advance on 2,700? Do I hear 2,800? 2,800 I'm bid. 2,900? 2,900 here. 3,000. 3,000 I'm bid. I can't do it. Interesting man - your son. I beg your pardon? It's remarkable what people go through, and how it shapes who they become. He's a one of a kind - George. If anyone can do this, he can. Going twice. 3,100. 3,200. 300. 400. 3,400 I'm bid. Dad, Dad! Stop, I can't let you do this. LIZZIE: What about the shop? That place was our dream, maybe this is yours. AUCTIONEER: Going once. Go on, son. 3,500. Any advance? Going once then, going twice... sold! Reverend, I'm so sorry. I know Oakfield was very special to you. Never mind that. What does a man like him want with a place like this anyway? I washed Stanley in that sink the day he was born. I remember. We had every birthday party of his in this room, till he was 19, till he went away. Him and George. You think you won't be able to keep him alive when you leave this house. But you will. Please, love, we've already lost one son... I'll never forgive you for selling our home, Albert. Careful with that, please! No talk of zoos or wild animals until the villagers get to know us. For now, we keep a low profile. You'll be warmer in here for now. Oh! I might have known. You might have known what? Subsidence. Georgie! Georgie! Lizzie, I'm so sorry. It slipped. I told you all to be careful with it! I'm so sorry! SHE SHOUTS Lizzie! Lizzie? Where are you going? That's half a shilling exactly. Thank you. Oh, God! Welcome to Upton. Thank you, Reverend. I've been meaning to call in on you as a matter of fact. About your girls. I wondered if we might be seeing them at Sunday school? Erm, well, perhaps when we're settled. Oh, whatever must people think of me walking around all filthy dirty? I dare say this village could do with something to stir it up. KNOCK AT DOOR Cold tea I'm afraid, love, till I get that stove working. Will you help me decorate? Any way you want. Mortimer? Dad! CRUNCHING Aagh! A monkey! A what? A monkey attacked me! Let's go and have a look. Where would he have gone? He must be starving by now. Dad, where's the fuel can? In the hall. MONKEY SHRIEKS GUNSHOTS ONLOOKERS GASP MONKEY SHRIEKS Hey! Come on, then. Come on. What are you people doing here? Trying to build something for my family. For everyone's family, if you'd let me. I won't ever let anyone hurt you again. You're safe now. Home. "Now we're fully moved in, "I'm happy to report that Oakfield is the perfect property for a zoo. "If you count the stable block, "plus all the rooms you've got in the house, "minus those occupied by human beings of course, "then you quickly see there's space for dozens more species." Might rain in the night. Better safe than sorry. I did some sums. If we make it through winter, get the doors open by next summer, then we might make ends meet. Just. Right. But that means no more mouths to feed. You can't have a zoo without animals. BIRDS SHRIEK, LIONS GROWL I'm looking for someone with a sense of adventure, and a very big van. All my customers are curious to know what it is you intend to do with Oakfield? He must have gone. Gone where? You bring them back here and there'll be a petition raised in Upton in no time. How's the grand design coming along? Any tigers prowling the grounds yet? You found something, didn't you? If anyone were to get hurt and it came out that you'd done nothing about an unlicensed zoo... How could Dad leave us in the lurch like this? GROWLING
