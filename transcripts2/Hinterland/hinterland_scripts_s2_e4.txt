 According to the neighbour, Greta Pritchard left her car outside the house after work on Monday night. The next day, the car was gone. Greta hasn't been seen since. It looks as though she may have left in a hurry. There was broken glass on the floor and fresh flowers stuffed into the bin. Spat with a boyfriend? Yeah, possibly. Mr Pritchard? We still need to formally identify the body, Mr Pritchard. When did you last see Greta? Last weekend. Friday, I... ..can't remember.

 Was there anyone else in the car? No. I want to see her. Mr Pritchard? It's not Greta. That is not my daughter. Do you have any idea where your daughter may be, Mr Pritchard? I'm sorry. Greta hasn't been seen at home for over three days. You've got to find her. We're doing all we can to trace her. Does she have a boyfriend? No. Are you sure? Someone who may have bought her flowers? There was someone. A while back. Harry something. Did you ever meet him? Yes. Unfortunately. Twice. You didn't approve? He wasn't good enough for her. Do you know where we may find Harry? We'll need a recent photograph of Greta. DC Ellis will drive you home. Lloyd? Hello, sir. Mr Pritchard was very good to me when my father died. He was my old headmaster, sir. Greta Pritchard's life may still be in danger, sir. We need to identify the woman in the car. If we can find out who she is,we will be  a step closer to finding Greta Pritchard. I agree, sir. Let me know as soon as there are any developments. Could Greta and the dead woman have been lovers? But her father said she had a boyfriend. Maybe she couldn't make up her mind. Maybe Greta killed her lover, hid the body in the car, dumped the car in the lake and then disappeared. That's why she left in a hurry. Or maybe that's what the killer wants us to think. Some place. It was in its heyday. The owner died of a broken heart. It's been empty ever since. Where's the school? Just around the corner. It's fair to say we're a close team. How do you mean? The school. We're fighting to keep it open. Greta's a big part of that fight. And is this Greta? Yes. And who is this? Mr Rhys Jones. Gareth. He left last year. We had to let him go. Cutbacks. Greta's wonderful with the children. It's in her blood. 'When did you last see Greta? ' On Monday. After work. We went to Aber for a lecture in the evening. Did you travel there together? No. She drove home first and came in on the train. There were drinks afterwards. We decided to stay. How long were you there for? A few hours. Both of you? No. Greta took a call.  Went outside. And then? She came back in, grabbed her coat and left. You didn't think that was odd? I was surprised she didn't say goodbye. And when she didn't turn up for work the next day? She sent me a text early Tuesday morning saying she wasn't feeling well. When did you make contact last? She sent another on Wednesday. I texted her back, told her to let me know when she was feeling better, said we'd manage until then. We'll need to see those texts. Yes, of course. In recent weeks, did Greta seem worried? Anxious? No, not really. But a few weeks ago, there was a man she'd been seeing. Harry. He turned up at the school, was hanging round at the gate. Refused to go. My husband. Does he work here? Not by choice! He's a carpenter on the estate. Renovation. But he helps us here at the school too. It's all hands on deck. It's the only way we can keep the place open. Mr Parry? I'm here about Greta Pritchard. Everything all right? We found her car abandoned. She's missing. How well do you know her? Pretty well. Her and Rhian are a good team. Where were you on Monday night, Mr Parry? Erm... In my workshop on the estate. What's this about? She's been missing for four days. And we have reason to believe that her disappearance is suspicious. Your wife mentioned an altercation you had with a man outside the school gates a while back. Oh, I wouldn't call it that. It scared her. He seemed a nasty piece of work. Harry someone? Was he a local boy? Do you know him? No. Can you remember anything about him? No. But judging by the show he put on, she's well rid of him. Why didn't anyone phone the police? Would it have made a difference? 'Greta took a train into Aber on Monday night,' got a call, left, and hasn't been seen since. How did she get home? Train? Taxi? Or somebody gave her a lift. But who? Check the records. See if she had any contact with the police and if anything came of it. You were right. Greta Pritchard contacted the police on a number of occasions to complain about malicious communications. Threatening texts, anonymous letters, hang-ups. "Without me, you are nothing. "Stop playing games or you'll regret it." She also thought that somebodywas breaking  into her house when she wasn't there. Who? Harry. Harry Jenkins. The ex-boyfriend? The Harry something that likes to hang out school gates? Him? Yes. Him. Harry Jenkins? That's right. Working late? It's either that or I don't get paid. We'd like to talk to you about Greta Pritchard. Have you seen her recently? Mr Jenkins? Greta's paranoid. It's all in her head. Oh, yeah? Like the malicious texts you sent her? The anonymous letters? Like turning up to the school and causing trouble, Mr Jenkins? Is that in her head too? I needed to talk to her. She wouldn't listen. Is that right? "You are naked. My hand's on your neck." "Don't breathe.  Don't scream." That's personal. She got off on it. We both did. Where is she? How should I know? I haven't seen her for weeks. Your people told me not to. I'd like you to have a look at this photograph. Do you know her? I don't know. Have another look. I think I've seen her before. Where? I can't remember. Try harder, Mr Jenkins. This woman has just lost her life. I saw her in Borth once. With Greta. A few weeks back. Were they friends? I don't know. Lovers? No. You and Greta, how did you meet? At the pub. She asked me to take her home. We hadn't even spoken. Was she drunk? She likes a drink. And you took advantage of that? It was Greta that called  the shots, not me. And was it Greta that ended it? She said she'd found someone who understood her better. Oh, yeah? Do you have a name? Why would I care? After we finished, she went mental. You see this? Greta did it. Completely lost it. Attacked me. Said I was stalking her. Calling all the time. And were you? No. Never. Like I said, she's paranoid. Just like her father. Gwilym Pritchard? Always checking up on her. Controlling her. Have you ever met him? Greta was afraid of him. Of what he'd say if he saw her with someone like me. Have you identified the woman in the car yet? No. And Greta? No news. Mr Pritchard, did you call Greta a lot? I'm her father. I was worried about her. When Bethan my wife died... .. it was as though something in Greta died too. She was different somehow. Looking for different things. In what way? It was as though nothing mattered any more. Was she angry? Yes. With herself. With life. Is that why she drank? What are you trying to suggest? Was she ever violent? No. But she did argue? Yes. The two of us are as stubborn as each other. That's what her mother used to say. Greta was close to her mother? Yes. I felt like the odd one out at times. I shouldn't say that. Sorry. I devoted my whole life to other people's children. I should have taken better care of my own. And now it's too late. We don't know that, Mr Pritchard. Don't we? We will find out who the dead woman is, Mr Pritchard. And when we do, we'll find out what happened to your daughter. Sir, I've got something. Greta's been visiting dating sites, looking for Mr Right. Did she find him? Ben Willis from Perth in Scotland. They had some winks, then exchanged messages. Winks? You wink at someone you like, then they contact you if they like you back. This guy liked her back. You know a lot about dating sites, Lloyd. This Ben Willis guy? They exchanged messages, then he deactivated, stopped using his dating account, used e-mail instead. What kind of messages? Intimate. Sometimes explicit. Is this the man in Greta's life? Looks like internet contact only and Greta ended that three months ago. Maybe that made him angry. Sian? Greta Pritchard got a taxi. I've spoken to the driver. He remembers driving her back to Borth  on Monday night from Aberystwyth. She was on the phone rowing with somebody. She was shouting all the way home. She was upset, angry. Who with? Did he get a name? Harry Jenkins. All I did was send some drunken texts. The phone calls,  the silent hang-ups. You were stalking her. Why would I waste my minutes? She's the one chasing me. Check my phone records. I didn't call her. You called her on Monday night. That was just a one-off. You were arguing. What about? She left a message. Threatening me. That's why I called her. She said she was going to the police again. What was she going to tell us? That I'd been in her flat, which I never. But you were stalking her. If that's what you want to call it, yeah. I was pissed off! Angry that she dumped me. But I'm over it. It hurt your ego, didn't it? No. You had to have her, didn't you? Couldn't let her go. I thought a lot of her, right? What's this? It was in your phone. That was ages ago. I didn't know I still had it. Where were you on Monday? I've already said. One dead, one missing. It doesn't look good, does it? I didn't kill this girl. And I don't know where Greta is. He's full of surprises, I'll give him that. Who? Harry Jenkins. I've been going through the anonymous letters Greta was receiving from him. They weren't all dirty messages. It turns out Harry is a lover of poetry. Christina Rossetti, in particular. "A fool I was to sleep at noon "And wake when night is chilly "Beneath the comfortless cold moon "A fool to pluck my rose too soon "A fool to snap my lily." Greta Pritchard accused Harry Jenkins of sending these letters? Apparently so. I think it's safe to say that Harry Jenkins is no poet. Look at the paper. It's expensive. This was carefully chosen. Harry's texts were sent in anger. They were a threat. This is a declaration of love. So who sent them, then? What was the name of the other teacher at Plas y Dderwen School? Gareth Rhys Jones. Yeah. Find him. I want to speak with him. Shall we release Harry Jenkins then, sir? Yes. Forensics have just got back about the blonde hairs they found in Greta's house, sir. They're a match with the victim. So the dead woman was in Greta's house? Yes. Any sign of a sexual assault? Nothing. How did she die? Asphyxiation. Manual strangulation. She was dead before she was put in the water, sir. Ok. Mathias. Gareth Rhys Jones, sir. He's dead. When? Eight months ago. Killed himself. Drowned. I'm on my way. Gareth Rhys Jones was found dead after losing his job at Plas y Dderwen School at the end of the summer term. His body was found washed up in Aberdaron on the Lleyn Peninsula. The coroner ruled it was suicide. Why didn't Rhian Parry give us this information? And what else hasn't she told us? Ben Willis. Have you found him? No. He doesn't exist. I've spoken to the Perthshire authorities. There's no record of anyone by the name of Ben Willis living in Perth. It wouldn't be the first time a man's lied about who he really is. It's peaceful here. A secret garden. Yes. The estate's been empty for years. The trust, they keep me on to look after the gardens and take care of the house. What happened to the family? They've all gone. The man who lived here came back from the Great War. Within six weeks, his wife and two children were dead. Spanish flu. That's why he built the school. As a gift to the children of the parish. A memorial. To all that he'd lost. Do you recognise her? No. Sorry, I don't. Is this the girl you found in the car? Yes. Sorry. What about Gareth Rhys Jones? He worked with your wife at the school, didn't he? Rhian had no choice. She had to do what was best for the school. Nobody expected him to take his own life. It upset everyone. Rhian still blames herself. Feels responsible. Were Gareth and Greta close? I think he had a soft spot for her. Did he confide in you? No. I was only the gardener to him. Rhian said he was good at his job. I never took to him. I didn't like the way he talked about people. About Rhian. Greta. He didn't respect them. He took advantage of Greta after her mother died. Now, I don't like to judge people, but you never know what's going on in people's heads, do you? Were you and Greta close? No, not close. Not like her and Rhian. Thanks for your time. 'Do you recognise this woman? ' No. She doesn't work here. Are you sure? Definitely. But I have seen her before. She was in here recently having dinner. With who? It was my old headmaster. DI Mared Rhys. Ambulance, please. Trem y Gors. Trem y Gors. Ok? Gwilym Pritchard's bank statements. Three months ago, he started a standing order from his account. £500 a week every week for the last three months to a Kasia Dubrovsky. Kasia. The 'K' in the diary. He's paid her almost £6,000 so far. Why? We don't know. There's all the information. We went through his phone records, checked itemised bills. Gwilym regularly called three numbers. Greta's home phone, Greta's mobile and another mobile number. We think that might be Kasia's mobile. We tried to call it but it's dead. We know Greta disappeared on Monday night and the body was found on Thursday. But Gwilym's phone records show that he was still trying to call both Greta's and Kasia's mobiles. When? Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Which he wouldn't do if he knew Kasia was dead. So why won't he speak to us? If Kasia Dubrovsky is our victim in the lake... ..who killed her? Gwilym Pritchard's counsel says he's in no fit mental state to be questioned. But Greta could still be out there alive and we're running out of time. Let me see what I can do. Thank you. I hope you've brought my computer with you. We won't keep you long. That's good to hear. So the rumour's true then. About Gwilym Pritchard. Didn't know you cared. I don't. When did you last see him? A few months back. He came over to Greta's place. We'd had a few drinks. We were pretty pissed. He was angry. We had a few choice words. What about Greta? Like I said. She was off her head. Pushed far enough, who knows what she's capable of? DI Rhys. Did Greta ever mentioned the name Ben Willis to you? Never heard of him. We need to go. Gwilym Pritchard has been given the go-ahead for questioning. Thank you, sir. His counsel is not happy about it so tread carefully. I appreciate it, sir. We know about Kasia, Mr Pritchard. We know you gave her money. We know you called her. That you tried to contact her and Greta. Do you think I killed Kasia? I don't know, sir. I just want you to tell me the truth. I've been weak, Lloyd. When Bethan died I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. Greta... She was there all the time. She arranged the funeral. Took care of me. Cooking, cleaning. I depended on her. Too much. I was smothering her. That's why she asked Kasia to help out. Kasia was such a lovely girl. I was lonely. I'm not proud of what I did. Did you sleep with her? And did Greta find out? Yes. Last week. She was so angry. She hates me. She thinks I betrayed her mother. Betrayed her. Last thing she said... I was dead to her. And when I saw Kasia's body... .. I panicked. I thought maybe Greta had... That's why I lied... .. in the mortuary. To protect her. Now I've lost her. I'll never get her back. Harry. Ben Willis. Greta likes to keep secrets. Who does she share them with? Not her father. Kasia Dubrovsky? I've spoken to the bank, sir. I've got an address for Kasia Dubrovsky. Kasia Dubrovsky comes from Gdansk, Poland. 26. Oi! It's all right, it's ok, it's fine. Are you ok? Do you speak English? Show me your hands. I've spoken to the site owner. Her name's Bronka Bosniak. She's been living with Kasia for a month. Friends from home. Anything suspicious? He said he heard an argument over a week ago. There was another girl with her. The description of her car matches Greta Pritchard. So Greta was at the caravan? It looks that way. When can we speak to Bronka? We're still waiting for the doctors to discharge her. Cuts and bruises, nothing more. We should be able to talk to her soon. Ok, thanks. Iwan? Iwan Thomas? Did you tell your wife? About Gwen. About what happened to her. No. It's you that should have died, not Gwen. Look, Iwan... You're sorry. If you were any kind of man you'd have faced up to what you've done. But you're just like the rest of them. One of Prosser's boys. What have you got on Prosser that keeps him so close to you? What's the big secret? People die and you get away with it. You get to keep your job. Gwen. Mari Davies. Your own daughter. What do you want? My blood on your hands as well? Stay away from me. 'Why did you run? 'I was frightened.' Was Kasia your friend? Best friends. Since when we were little. Did you come to the UK together? No. Kasia came first, six months ago. I have only been here for three weeks. Bronka. DCI Mathias. There's no need to be afraid. I thought you were going to hurt me. I saw you at the hotel and at Greta's house. I thought you had taken my friend. It's ok, Bronka, I'm a police officer. She didn't come home! I didn't know where she was, I... Bronka, when did you last see Kasia? Monday. Greta told her to come to the flat... ...to collect her stuff. They were friends? Yes. Sometimes Greta and Kasia have a drink. Sometimes Kasia stayed the night there. Greta was teaching her English. So why did Greta ask Kasia to collect her stuff? There was an argument. What about? We need to know, Bronka. There was a row... ..about Greta's father. Was Kasia sleeping with him? Yes. For money? No! It wasn't like that. Kasia cared about Greta's father. She liked him very much. Why did Greta's father give Kasia money? It was... for Kasia's daughter... .. in Poland. To help pay for her to come here. Kasia loved her daughter very much. She missed her. The money was a gift. Can you think of anyone that would want to hurt Kasia? A friend? A colleague? Someone she talked about? We were in a cafe with Greta... ..there was a man. He was shouting. When? Last week... on the front. He was angry. Greta was upset. Him? Was it him? No. Are you sure? No, it is not him. No! It's him! 'That's him.' This is him. I knew as soon as I'd done it, I'd regret it. But I had to tell her. Greta wasn't pulling her weight in school, while Rhian was doing everything for her. And with Rhian expecting her first baby, I just didn't think it was fair. Rhian taking the strain while Greta was out every night drowning her sorrows. And what did you tell her? That she had to stop drinking. To think of other people. To pull herself together, stop feeling sorry for herself. To listen to those with her best interests at heart. Like you? In a way, yes. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to worry you, ba. You've got enough on your plate. I thought... I thought I could get through to her. And did you? She wouldn't listen. Made a bit of a scene. I just left. It was embarrassing. Greta was involved with someone online. Does the name Ben Willis mean anything to you? No. Sorry. I hear you spoke to Iwan Thomas. That's right. Did he have anything interesting to say for himself? The man is in pain. He's lost everything. His life is in ruins. Some people can handle the pressure. Others fall by the wayside. Well... ..we all have to carry our pack. Iwan Thomas is a dangerous man. He's a drunk. He's not to be trusted. You should stay away from him. He is grieving, sir. He needs to let go of the past. Don't let him drag you down, Tom. You have pulled yourself together, put the past behind you. That is the difference between you and him. Don't forget that. What was he doing there? Why was he at the site? I don't know. Greta Pritchard. Her mother's death sent her off the rails. She couldn't handle the grief. She was lonely, she found solace online. Ben Willis. But it was too much, too soon, so she broke it off. And that's when she met Harry Jenkins. When the anonymous letters started, the silent phone calls, the hang-ups, Greta thought it was Harry that was responsible, but it wasn't. It was this guy - Ben Willis. Somebody has got to know who he is. You're right, Mared. But who? 'Ben Willis.' Greta had a relationship with him online, for a number of months, before she cut contact. Ben Willis. Wait a minute. Now, then... There he is. Benjamin Willis. He was the groundsman on the estate. Helped build the school after the Great War. He looked after the house and gardens all his life. Can I keep this? Of course. Thanks. Benjamin Willis devoted his life to the estate. He was obsessed by it. Arwyn Parry knows every inch of the estate. 'He also knows the history. I think he has used the name' Ben Willis as an alias. I think he is our killer. 'Get all units over to the school.' Greta could still be alive. We also need to warn Rhian. She could be in danger. Rhian? Come on! Rhian? Are you ok? Where is he, Rhian? Rhian! Tom! Arwyn? Arwyn? Arwyn, I know you're here. Arwyn! Arwyn. It's over. I know it was you that killed Kasia. Where's Greta?! Arwyn! Here! Greta. Here! Where are you? In here! I'm over here! Hello? Hello?! Greta?! I'm in the well! Over here! Greta! Please help me! Please! Please help me! Please! Greta, it's going to be all right. Please! It's going to be fine. I'm here to help you, ok? Don't worry. Sir! Sir. Sir. Sir! I wanted to help her. She seemed so alone. Lost. A few weeks after her mother died... .. I found her in the classroom. It was late. Everyone else had gone. She was crying. I offered her a lift home. She wasn't fit to drive. We got to her house. It was raining. She didn't say a word. Just sat there in the car with me... ..as if she didn't want to leave. When she got out of the car... I-I could still smell her. And Ben Willis? He gave his life to that estate. It meant everything to him. Being Ben... .. I could be anyone. Go anywhere. But then, Greta just cut me off. I couldn't let that happen. And Gareth Rhys-Jones? You set him up. And then you destroyed him. He was getting too close to her. You didn't want her to have any friends? She didn't need any friends. All she needed was me. Why kill Kasia? She was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I... She turned up at Greta's house with flowers, found me, started screaming... And you strangled her. I had no choice! What about your wife, Arwyn? What about your baby? I-I...Iove Rhian. But... I thought... I thought I could have it all. Are you ok, sir? Yeah, I will be. And you? Yes, sir. Thank you, Lloyd.
