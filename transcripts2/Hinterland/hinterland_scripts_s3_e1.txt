 You didn't see the attacker? No. He didn't say anything? No sign of a vehicle? Can you think of anyone, anyone at all who might hold a grudge against you? Hm! That's a long list. Any recent disputes? No. With somebody local, perhaps. Like Iwan Thomas? I saw what happened at the caravan park, sir. You didn't exactly part the best of friends. That doesn't mean he attacked me.

 Well, he hasn't been seen or heard from since the attack. His flat's been cleared out, his car's gone. Well, Iwan's angry, isn't he? He's lost everything. His job, his family. He blames everyone. Does he blame you? Why would he blame me, DS Owens? I don't know, sir, but whoever did this took everything from you. Your home, your possessions. That caravan was never my home. OK, sir, but I'm just aware that this was a very personal attack. Doesn't that leave you feeling vulnerable? Angry? Yes. But whatever I feel has no bearing on you finding my attacker, does it? Local minister, Elwyn Jones. Found dead this morning, sir. Forensics? On their way.

 Wife found the body. Family yet to be questioned, sir. Thank you, Lloyd. I thought you were taking some time to recover? This place has been broken into a few times over the years. Anything taken this time? Nothing left to take. He went to the chapel to pray first thing every morning. But this morning... ..he didn't come back. Were you aware of any problems within the congregation? Any disagreements, quarrels? No. Elwyn was very well thought of. No reason why anyone would want to harm him? Of course not. You're Elin's mum, aren't you? That's right. She's the year above me in school. She'd know who I am. I'm sure she would. Do you know anything that could help us, Beca? Beca? There was an argument. I-I came home early from school on Thursday. I didn't have any classes that afternoon. I went upstairs to get changed. I heard someone at the door. And then...shouting. I looked through the window and I saw Dad arguing with someone. With who? Lyn Edwards. The vet? What was it about? I couldn't hear. Did you ask your father about it afterwards? It's not my business to. Lyn was very faithful to the chapel. The whole family were. But then there was a car accident. His son, Gethin, was killed. And Elwyn went up there to speak to them, to offer comfort. I don't know exactly what was said, but, um... ..they...they never came back to Seion after that. My father believed everything that happens is God's will. Including the bad things. He'd never deliberately offend anyone... ..but sometimes he got it wrong. Have you spoken to DS Owens? Iwan Thomas. Do you think it was him? He tried to kill you, Tom. If he wanted to kill me, I'd be dead, wouldn't I? Lyn Edwards? Early lambing. If I have to perform a Caesarean, I try and get the animal in the back of the Land Rover, out of the mud. Which farm were you at? Er...Clos Celyn. Up the hill? Yeah. Why? Elwyn Jones? He's been killed, unfortunately. We found his body this morning. Yeah, I heard. We heard that you'd fallen out with him recently. Oh, we had a few words, yeah. What about? God. Capel Seion has been a big part of our lives since we moved here. My son, Gethin, was christened there. But, er, when he was killed... ..we lost our faith. Could you tell us about your relationship with Elwyn Jones? I thought he'd understand, but, er...he sat in our house and told us how our son's death somehow was God's will. That nearly broke my wife, Iola. I told him to stay away, to leave us alone. And did he? No, he kept calling over when I was at work. I had to put a stop to it! I thought Elwyn was a good man. But he was a self-righteous fool. Losing a child... ..changes everything. You try and make sense of what's happened, but... ..you can't. When Lyn Edwards lost his child, he lost his whole world. He was angry. He should be. Angry enough to kill? Come on. At eight o'clock this morning, the body of Elwyn Jones, minister at Capel Seion, was discovered in his own chapel at Cefn Sarn. We're still working to establish the exact time of death, but we believe that he was murdered during the early hours of this morning. Elwyn Jones was a community leader. Active in and out of the chapel. He was respected and loved. His murder has shaken the local community. We would like to ask the... ..in the days and hours leading to the murder, to contact us with any information they may have, regardless of how trivial it may seem. We would also... You all right, sir? Hm? Yeah. Huh! Fine. Thanks. Are you OK, Lloyd? Yes, sir, I'm fine. Good, so we're all fine. Early reports from Pathology are in. Time of death between 5am and 7am. There was also a high level of alcohol in the victim's blood. He likes his drink. Mm-hm. Oi! Oh! Sorry! Sorry! My fault. Let me help you. No, no, I'm fine. Huh! Sorry. What can I get you? I'll have one of those, please. Thanks. Is it always this lively here? We had plans to modernise. Renovate. We? Well, plans change. Yeah. What about you? What about me? Have you got any plans? Hello? When? Now? OK. My wife's staying with her sister for a while. Under the circumstances, I thought it a good idea. What circumstances? You're lucky to be alive, Tom. And until we find Iwan Thomas, he continues to be a threat. To both of us. I met up with him the night before he attacked you. He was making all sorts of wild accusations. What kind of accusations? He accused me of single-handedly wrecking his career. He's obsessed by it. Well, have you told DS Owens about this, sir? I don't think telling her now would help her find him. Well, she's in charge of the investigation, sir, not me. Iwan Thomas has unfinished business with both of us. We need to be careful, Tom. You need to be careful. I spoke to Eurof Daniel last night. The preacher? He said that something troubled him about Elwyn's marriage. In what way? He didn't quite say. So I pulled Sioned's medical records to see if she was on any antidepressants. She went to A&E; last year with a broken wrist. Said that she'd fallen in the garden, but the doctors put it down as suspicious. You think he beat her? There are a few instances going back over the years. Broken rib, black eye. I find the music comforting. My father did, too. I feel closer to God here than I do anywhere else. Well, that's good. Do you have faith? Me? I did once. For me... ..faith reshapes the way the faithful see the world. And sometimes, we forget to make allowances for people who don't see things the same way. Did you learn that at theology college? Was I preaching? Huh! No, just being passionate, that's all. Your father. Was he a good man? He tried to be. But nobody is truly good. That's the point of Christianity. To bridge the gap between the perfect and the imperfect. God and man. So, he wasn't perfect? If you believe in the Bible, there's a force of evil that compels our actions if you don't surrender yourself to God. But your father, he surrendered himself to God. And things still happened, didn't they? We're all born sinners. He tried his best. And we forgave him. And forgave and forgave. Things didn't change. Do you think...sinners are punished? We all sin and deserve punishment. However we get it is down to the grace of God. Lloyd? I've been going through a list of people associated with the chapel, sir. There's a gardener, Trystan Meilir, who cuts the grass. Turns out he's got a criminal record. What for? Breaking and entering. He spent two years at a young offenders' unit. Where does he live? I'm sending the address over now, sir. Fine. Good. We're looking for a Trystan Meilir. Does he live here? Who's asking? We need to speak to him. Thank you(!) Trystan Meilir? Do you know why we're here? I can guess. Where were you yesterday morning between five and seven? Asleep. Can anyone verify that? No. How well do you know Elwyn Jones? He offered me work, I took it. Did you ever talk to him? Nothing to talk about, really. I did the work...he paid me and I went on my way. Did you tell him about your past? About your time at the young offenders' unit? He didn't ask. I didn't tell him. But he knew about it? Well, it wasn't exactly a secret. And it's not like I killed anyone. Isn't it? Thank you for your time. It's not me you should be talking to. It's the vet. And why should we be talking to him? Because Elwyn Jones was shagging his wife. Mrs Edwards? Mrs Edwards? My husband's not here. We were hoping to have a word with you, actually. Is this about Elwyn? We understand that you knew him well. I did. He buried my son. Lyn fell to pieces after Gethin's death. He stopped going to chapel, he...he lost his faith. But mine grew stronger. Was your relationship with the minister ever more than...spiritual? Was it a physical relationship? No! Never! I love my husband. But you and the minister were close, right? I mean, you...you knew him well? I thought I did. Last week, I went to see him at the chapel and he was different, he was... He was angry. He said some hurtful things. What things? He said, er... ..that I shouldn't blame God for taking away my son, that I should blame myself because I was the one driving the car. What happened then? I left, I came home, um... I was upset. And then Lyn arrived home and he could see that I'd been crying and so, I had no choice, I had to tell him. And then Lyn went to confront the minister? He went over to the house, told him to keep away from me, to keep away from both of us. And that was the end of that? No. Er...Elwyn came here a few days later. Why? To apologise. And I said that I forgave him, but deep down, I'd seen him for what he was and I wasn't going to be fooled again. And was Lyn here when the minister came to the house? No. But he passed Elwyn's car on the road. He was furious. Wanted to go after him, have it out with him. And did he? No, no. I persuaded him not to. Iola, what day was that? Erm...the day before he died. So, the next morning, the morning that he was killed, murdered, when you woke up... ..was your husband with you? No. No, he'd already left. When we spoke to you yesterday, Mr Edwards, you told us that you and your wife had turned your backs on the chapel after the death of your son. Yes. That you were consoling each other, helping each other through your grief. Yes, that's right. That's not the whole truth, is it, Mr Edwards? The truth is, you may have lost your faith, but your wife, her faith was the only thing she had left. Since the death of your son, you and your wife have been like strangers. No. Each of you trying to find your way through, a way of coping. For you, it was your work. But that wasn't enough for Iola. What she needed was solace. Spiritual comfort. And that is what the minister was able to give her. And the fact that he was able to do that, to comfort her in a way that you couldn't, that made you angry! Jealous! No. That's not it. The man was cruel. He offered a hope and then took it away. That's why you went to his house last week to tell him to stay away. Yes. He came to your house, didn't he, after you warned him not to. And when your wife told you that he'd been there you lost your temper. No. I don't blame you. You warned him to stay away and he didn't listen. You were only trying to protect your wife. You'd lost your son. Your life had fallen apart and then this man, this minister, came to your house and dared to blame your wife for her own son's death. Of course you lost your temper. Why wouldn't you? I've told you before, I didn't kill Elwyn Jones. I was at Ronnie Evans' place. Yes, you said. Lambing. We spoke to him. There you go. According to Mr Evans, you were gone by 5am. According to your wife, you were home just before eight. Where were you for those three hours, Mr Edwards? Where were you? Nowhere. I sat in my car. I couldn't go back to the house. Since my son was killed... ..going home is... I couldn't... Are you holding him? He has motive, opportunity and no alibi. We're going up to the chapel to see what else people have to say. Mathias. How's your head? Iwan. Now you know what it's like to lose everything. Where are you? Did you enjoy your little conversation last night? Do you think he's your friend? Do you think you can trust him? Who? Prosser. Iwan, this has got to stop. You've got to come in. It's too late for that. Why was Trystan so sure that the minister was having an affair with Lyn Edwards' wife? Why say that to us if it wasn't true? Tom? Mm? What do you think? I don't know. ♪ Arglwydd dyma fi ♪ Ar dy alwad di ♪ Canna f'enaid yn y gwaed ♪ A gaed ar Galfari. ♪ Where's the daughter? I'm going. Can I come in? I expected to see you at the chapel. Couldn't do it. Act like he was a saint. We know that he assaulted your mother. Was he ever violent towards you? Just Mam. He'd pray for hours after. Apologising to his God. He never apologised to Mam. That must have been very hard for you. And for your brother. Nothing we did was ever good enough. Owain thought... ..training to be a minister, following in his footsteps, would make Dad happy. And did it? Nothing made him happy. Is it true that you've arrested Lyn Edwards? Mm-hmm, yes. You think you know someone... Trystan! Any sign of the suspect? 'No, nothing yet. We're still searching the area.' He was making a go of it. Trying to get his life together after the mess he'd made of it. After the mess we all made of it. He never knew his real father. His mother's boyfriend used him as a punchbag. And my daughter... ..she never stuck up for him. In her own way, she did her best. But she was never a natural mother. Some women aren't. It's no wonder he ended up in that unit. What chance did he have? I should have done something when he was young. But I didn't want to interfere. I should have done more. What is it, Lloyd? A witness has come forward. Say they saw Lyn Edwards sitting in his car up on the ridge. His alibi stacks up, sir. Release him. Yes, sir. Your wife needs you, Lyn. It may not feel like that right now but each other is all you have. She needs God more than she needs me. No. Hope is what she needs. How can I give her hope? When all I want to do is close my eyes and never wake up. Well, if you find the answer to that one, will you let me know? Everyone else who looked at Elwyn Jones saw a man of God. But maybe Trystan saw him for what he really was. But why kill him? Trystan had no quarrel with him. Maybe he didn't get paid on time. OK. Maybe... ..Trystan recognised something in Elwyn. It reminded him of his upbringing. Like living with his mother's boyfriend. A violent, controlling hypocrite. Sir, I've found something. We found Trystan's laptop during the search of his house. No encryption. I got straight into his e-mails. Look who they're from. Beca Jones. They know each other? Intimately. This is one of the last e-mails Beca sent to Trystan before her father's death. "I hate him. I wish he was dead." Look at this. After Beca's father was found dead, Trystan sent 17 e-mails without reply. He sent this one yesterday afternoon. "The police have been here. I didn't tell them anything. "I didn't tell them about us." And then he gets one back. "You think you've fixed everything. You've ruined everything. "There is no us." I need you to tell me everything you know about Trystan. Would you rather if we spoke alone? So, you and Trystan, how did it start? I saw him at the chapel. Cutting the grass, doing odd jobs for my father. One day he asked me my name and we stated talking. I liked him. He listened to me. Was he your first boyfriend? It was fun at first. I... I felt sorry for him. Nobody ever gave him a chance but he was trying really hard. Then one night, we were up on the hill. He gave me some beer. I must have had too much. I got upset. I told him things I shouldn't have. I told him about my father. I had to tell somebody, Mam. I couldn't stand seeing what he did to you and you just saying nothing and just hiding it and putting up with it. He didn't mean it, Beca. Your dad was suffering. He hit you, Mam. And...I told Trystan. I told Trystan the truth. And how did he react when you told him? He was angry. Angry enough to do something about it? He loves me. Is that why you haven't answered any of his e-mails? Are you scared of him? Beca, it's like you said. You think you know people. Trystan. Trystan, wait. If you run away now... ..you'll be running your whole life. Yeah? He's a good boy. Give him a chance. Please. None of us get to choose our parents, do we? It's the luck of the draw. So, it must have been hard for you after the upbringing you had, knowing what Beca was going through. I know what you're trying to say. And it's not true. After we spoke to you yesterday about the minister's death you sent her an e-mail, didn't you? "The police were here. I didn't tell them anything. "I didn't tell them about us." When we spoke to you yesterday, why didn't you tell us about your relationship with her? I knew it wouldn't look good. Why? Because you've got a record? I was just trying to keep her out of trouble. Beca responded to your e-mail, didn't she? "There is no us. "You think you fixed things but you ruined my life. You ruined it all. "Stay away from me." You killed him, didn't you? That's why you went round to the house last night. I went there to talk. To tell her you'd had enough. That you couldn't let him hurt her any more and that's why you killed him. No. Then why did you run? Because people like me always get the blame! I didn't kill anyone. They're better off without him. Yeah, well, you don't get to decide that. At least Beca can be who she wants now and her brother can get on with his life! What do you mean? Elwyn told him to quit college. Get a job. When? A couple of weeks ago. He spent his whole life trying to please that man. At least he's done with that now. We need to talk to Owain. What? His son, Owain. Turns out he and his father weren't on the same page after all. You haven't been entirely honest with us, Owain. I told you everything you wanted to know. Everything except the fact that your father was making you give up your studies. He didn't want you to go to college. He wanted you to get a job. Who told him that? I didn't say anything. Is it true?! Money was tight. It was only fair. This has nothing to do with Elwyn's death. A man who blighted your childhood. No. A violent man of the cloth. That must have made you question your faith. No. And then he tried to destroy your future. That's not true! You never meant to kill him but you were so angry with him... You put up with so much, so come on, tell the truth. All of you, tell the truth. Tell the truth, Owain! Tell the truth! I did it. I killed him. Mam? I thought I was lucky. That I'd married a good man. I should have walked away the first time he hit me. It's easy to say, isn't it? Until it happens to you. I felt so ashamed. I pretended it didn't happen. And then the more it happened, the more ashamed I felt. Did your husband ever harm the children? Not physically, no. But his behaviour, it affected them. I just wanted their future to be different. I wanted them to be happy. But he wouldn't even allow that. On the day that he was murdered, what happened? It was dark, still early. He'd been down there all night, in his chair. I went down there to talk to him. To reason with him. I begged him not to do this to Owain. But he wouldn't listen. He got up and he walked away. He said there was nothing more to discuss. I went after him. I was so angry. I hit him. How? With a hammer. He fell. And he was gone. And then what? I tidied the place up... ..wiped down the hammer... ..and I went back to the house. Beca got up for breakfast, I waved her to school and then I shouted at Owain to tell him I was going down to the chapel and then I came back and I told him I'd found Elwyn and that's when I called you. I killed him because I love my children. Do you buy that? You saw the report. There are no prints on that hammer, just like she said. What is it, Lloyd? There's someone here to see you. We thought we'd come and talk to you about what's likely to happen next. She's going to jail, we know that. Can we come in and talk to you about it? Is Owain here? He's gone to the chapel. Owain? Shit. ♪ And again he entered into Capernaum ♪ Wedi rhai dyddiau ♪ A chlybuwyd ei fod ef yn y ty ♪ Ac yn y man llawer a ymgasglant ynghyd ♪ Hyd na annent ♪ Hyd yn oed yn y lleoedd ynghylch y drws ♪ Ac efe a bregethodd y gair iddynt hwy ♪ A daethant ato... ♪ 'I saw him walking up from the chapel... '..and I just knew there was something wrong. 'He came in the kitchen. 'I saw the blood on his clothes. 'He was shaking and... '..sweating.' So, I put him in the shower. Told him to stay in his room. And then I went down to the chapel and I found him. The night before, Elwyn was drunk. He was so drunk. Owain just wanted to talk to him about staying in college... ..but he wouldn't talk to him. He wouldn't even look at him. Owain was heartbroken. His father was taking away his whole world. Maybe Owain did it just to protect you. He did. When all we ever want to do is to protect our children. That's what I thought I was doing. Sorry, Lloyd. I'll do this. You go home. Go on. Sir. What are you doing? Iwan Thomas' cousin, Gareth Thomas. Did you speak to him? But you went up there, right? You searched his house? I'm waiting for a warrant. Good. Any news on Iwan? Sir, you know I can't talk to you about any of this. But if you've got any information... ..if you've heard anything... ..then you should tell me. DS Owens. Where is he? Who? Iwan! I don't know anything. Do you know who I am? Of course I do. When you see him, you tell him that I'm looking for him, OK?
