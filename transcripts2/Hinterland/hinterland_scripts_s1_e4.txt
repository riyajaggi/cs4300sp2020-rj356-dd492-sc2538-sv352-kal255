 SOCO need another hour. She's been placed like that. Carefully placed. Do we have a name? Mrs Thomas? Gwen? When did you see Alys last? A couple of days ago. Is that normal? We speak on the phone sometimes, but... ..we haven't been that close just recently. Any particular reason?

 There was an argument. About what? I don't remember. She's impulsive. Like her dad. Is he here? Can we talk to him? My husband and I haven't spoken in months. I have no idea where he is. Alys Thomas. Classics undergraduate, was studying in Aber. Pathology think she'd been dead for 8-10 hours before she was found. That puts time of death between ten and 12 last night. What else have we got? Bruising to the face consistent with a blow or a fall. No signs of sexual assault.

 We're waiting for the medical examiner's report to confirm. What about her shoes, her mobile? Missing. No sign. I want them found. Alys was dressed to impress. She was taking care of the way she looked. Was that for her own benefit, or somebody else's? What about the tattoo? A Celtic symbol of female power, sir. Triskele. It's got other meanings, too. Could be religious, could be lots of things. What about her parents? Gwen and Iwan Thomas married young. 1989. Gwen was 18, Iwan 21. They separated in 2004. But they were never divorced. What do we know about the father? He was one of us. A police officer? What happened to him? We had to let him go. The man liked his drink. Did you know about this? Let's find out where he lives. House on the estate, sir. We've already checked. There's no sign of him. He hasn't been seen for days. Well, let's find out where he works. Yes, sir. I want a picture of how the dead girl lived. Who she knew and what she believed in. Whoever did this felt something for her. She wasn't dumped, she was placed. It was a conscious act. And I want to know why. I don't think I ever spoke to Iwan Thomas. I was still in uniform back then. But you know what happened? Rumour has it he wasn't up to it. I've found where Iwan Thomas works, sir. I'll check him out. What about friends? She doesn't have any really. Only Sara. Sara Perkins. They study together, classics. They've been close for years. Still are. Did Alys have any plans last night? Was she due to meet someone, go somewhere? Did Alys come home in the evenings? Generally, I mean. No. No, she's got a flat in town. She shares it with Sara. We'll need an address. Could you think of anyone that would want to hurt your daughter? What's her relationship with her father like? I don't know. They used to be close. Sara Perkins? You were friends, weren't you, you and Alys? We've known each other since primary school. You must've been through a lot together. Did Alys have a boyfriend? Alys didn't like to get involved. Why not? You don't seem to know much about your friend, do you? Don't you care? Of course I care. Lately, I'm not sure she cared much about me, though. Alys changed. The last few months, she was... ..she was different. We need to see her room. Odi et amo. I hate and I love. I hate and I love. Who does she hate? Who does she love? Catullus 85. Odi et amo. "I hate and I love. "Why, you may ask? I know not, "but I feel it happening" and I am tormented. She was really taken by it. She was so full of life. When did you see Alys last? Yesterday. When? Morning, in my lecture. What kind of a student was she? Bright. But she suffered the usual problems one associates with growing up. In what way? Hm! Alys felt things intensely. She was unique. She didn't just study it, she lived it. She had character. She was bright. There was no place for mediocrity. She was a creative soul. But recently she'd lost her way and, er... Well, it happens. Were you concerned about her? Well, she was fragile. There was a darkness in her. And there was something going on at home. It was a difficult time for her. We need to speak with her father. Well, I can't help you there. I'm sorry. This is Alys at 17:22 yesterday afternoon, arriving at Aberystwyth station wearing the same dress, carrying a small bag. She was dressed up for something. For a man? Not necessarily. Now, this is an angle from inside the station. She's catching the 17:30 heading east to Shrewsbury. I checked CCTV all along the route. She didn't go very far. Ten minutes later, she got off at Borth station. Now, if we scroll forward to 22:55... ..the next train to Aberystwyth is due at 23:25. What's she looking for? Her phone. It has to be. She was dead within an hour. Where did she go? Let's get up there. And I want every inch of that platform searched. Can I help you? Yeah. And you are? Dyfan. Dyfan Richard. I live at the station house. Look after the museum. Is there a problem? Do you work here? I help out. Keep an eye on the place. Keep everything in order. Do you know this girl, Mr Richard? She was found dead on the marshes this morning. I used to see her quite often. She was pleasant. Different to the others. The others? Most of the people on the platform. There was a way about her. Always full of life. Ready with a smile. When did you last see her? I'm not sure. A few weeks ago? I only spoke to her a couple of times. That's all. Such a pretty girl. Bachman City Class. 3439. My brother Ian, he was a fanatic. Does he still collect? What did you and the girl speak about, Mr Richard? I don't recall. She was headed over to the hotel. The Rhediol hotel? Yes. That's the one. Where were you last night? Here. Home alone. And you saw nothing? Heard nothing? No. Nothing. She was here last night, about six-ish. With a man. Can you describe the man? I didn't get a look at him. But you remember the girl? She's not the sort of girl you'd forget. Been here a few times. A few times? And you say you never saw the man's face? Oh, I'm not really sure if it was the same man. You heard them together? Only rowing. Shouting and screaming, she was, slamming doors. The whole shebang. You should've seen the room afterwards. A right state. Did they leave anything behind? A bag, shoes? How did they pay? Cash. They left it on here. What time was this? 10:30? What about the room? Has it been cleaned? Yes, but, er...you can have a look, if you like. Thanks. 'Alys?' Who is this? Ever decreasing circles. Why were you calling her? No reason. How do you know her? I used to see her round. You were her dealer? We went to a few parties last summer, hooked up a couple of times. Had a few laughs. No big deal. She was wild with a couple of drinks inside her. When did you last see her? I don't remember. Try. A week? Two? Where were you last night? Here till closing time. What time was that? Midnight-ish. What about after closing time? I went home with someone. Who? Oh, does it matter? Is that how you got your black eye? Alys' father did it. Iwan Thomas. That's why I was phoning her. To warn her he was off his head on booze. He gets me outside, tells me to leave Alys alone. I try to tell him I got nothing to do with Alys any more, and he smacks me. When was this? Sunday night. Why did you wait so long before phoning Alys? I'd been phoning and phoning. I know, I checked the phone records. I was trying to warn her. I was looking out for her. Iwan's not a man you want to cross. Why hire him? Knows the patch. He's all right when he's sober. And when he isn't? You stay out of his way. Terrible what happened, though. Did you ever meet his daughter Alys? The man never shut up about her. This him? Yeah. You think he'd hurt her? He drove taxis for me. I don't want to get involved. I want a unit outside Iwan Thomas' house. Yes, sir. There's something else. What is it? A postmortem has been completed. There's evidence of multiple scarring on Alys' inner thigh. Recently? It doesn't appear so. You coming in? No. Mami? Gwen? He was a great dad. She adored him. What happened? There's no room for us in his life any more. He said the job needed him. More than usual? There was a case. It...got under his skin. Drink was a release. So they suspended him. What happened? They pulled him over. One of his own. Did him for drink-driving. Part of me was relieved. I thought we'd get the old Iwan back. But he was more distant than ever. Even with Alys? Could he have harmed her? Sober? Never. Any idea where we might find him? I know this is difficult for you, Gwen. But there's evidence of scarring on Alys' body. Was she...was she self-harming? It was something we knew about. We dealt with it. It passed. He should never have said those things. What things? My husband and I had an argument a couple of years ago. Some things were said. Not all of them were meant, and... ..Alys overheard. Overheard what? The usual drunken rant about how I never forgave him for never being able to give me a baby of my own. How he was the reason I had to settle for... ..second best. Alys was adopted? And was there any truth in what your husband said? No. I loved my daughter. Alys? Yes. Where did you find it? Rheidol Hotel in Borth. What was she doing there? That's what we're trying to find out. She's dead...because of us! We killed her, you and me! Our own daughter! This is between me and her! Iwan, stop it! Our daughter! Our own daughter! Hiya. Hiya. There's another meaning, sir. The triskele design. Mother, father, child. I hate and I love. The two people she loved the most. The two people that let her down. Stop! Oi! How do you feel? I've felt better. Take your time. There's no rush. Do you have children? You? No. No, I haven't. Does your brother build the whole model world, or is he a train enthusiast only? Hm! Oh, Ian loved his trains. Always did. Did? You know the marshes well, do you? I see them every day. Can you think of any reason why someone would want to place a body out there...like that? Not to my knowledge, no. But if I think of anything, or... ..if I hear something... ..I'll let you know. Thank you. You're welcome. I switched on my phone... ..and there they were. Message after message. About Alys. Two from my boss. One telling me you lot were looking for me. The other sacking me for going AWOL. So you got drunk. Then I got angry. So, what now? Well, that depends. On what? On whether you had anything to do with Alys' death. Why did you hit Dean? He's a...waste of space. Do you think he killed your daughter? He's capable of it. She was... ..a precious...beautiful girl. She was. Catch him! Please. Catch the man who did this to Alys. "They took the flowers of the oak "and the flowers of the broom "and the flowers of the meadowsweet, "and from those, they conjured up the fairest "and most beautiful maiden that anyone had ever seen." "And they baptised her in the way they did at that time "and named her Blodeuwedd." Rootless, lonely and ignored by the man she was made for. Hardly the fairytale it's made out to be. Dates and times from the hotel in Borth. Alys stayed five times in total. I also ran a check on phone numbers taken from Alys' mobile. Thanks. She phoned one number three times that night between 6:00 and 6:15pm. No reply. Then she calls a landline at 6:20pm. The call only lasted a few minutes. The landline was traced to an address on Constitution Hill. Wynford Rees. Yes, sir. You shouldn't have gone up to the marshlands alone like that. No. It was reckless. I know. I'm sorry. You might not value yourself much but it doesn't mean that we don't. I said sorry, Mared. He never asked about Alys. Not once. Never asked about the case, how it was going. Who? Dyfan Richard. He never asked the questions he should have had asked. What are you talking about? Is this Professor Rees' class? Yes. Where is he? He didn't show. Mrs Rees? Yes. Is your husband in? You weren't at your lecture this morning, Mr Rees. My husband hasn't been well. She started missing classes. She seemed distracted... disinterested. I called her to my office to try to get to the source of the problem. Offered one-to-one tutorials to help. Doesn't explain the large number of calls she made to you. Well, she was behind with her work. She was nervous, panicking, anxious. It happens sometimes. She called you at home. Yes. You gave her your private number? She was a troubled soul. Was the tattoo for you? Sorry? The tattoo on her arm. Where were you Monday night, Mr Rees? Here. Can anyone verify that? I can. Wynford and I had dinner together. Thank you, Mr Rees. Get Lloyd to run a check on Wynford Rees. Already on it. Same goes for Dyfan Richard. Yeah. Yeah, Mathias. Sir, it's Lloyd. I think you need to get down here. I-It was Dean. It was Dean that killed Alys. They got together last summer. She thought it was just a fling. But Dean thought it was more than that. He loved her? I think so. But he'd never admit it. Why does that hurt you so much, Sara? How long have you been seeing Dean? Six months. Did Alys know? Yeah. Did she care? No. She didn't love Dean? I told you...it was just a fling. But to Dean, it meant more? He couldn't let go? He was only with me to be close to her. He wanted me to dress like her, dye my hair like her. He even went and got the same tattoo on his arm. Like there was some kind of connection between them. But there wasn't? She hadn't really been close to anybody recently. She'd been in a really...weird place. The Blodeuwedd stuff in her notebook, is that what that was about? She said that her and Blodeuwedd were the same. Reckoned they'd been conjured out of nothing. Whatever that means. Monday night, Dean was at work, wasn't he? According to this, he was at the Pier Amusements till gone midnight. No, he wasn't. Oh, go on. I couldn't get hold of him. I went down there about 10:00 and he wasn't there. The guy looking after the place was pissed off, said he hadn't seen Dean for hours. Where was he, Sara? You think he was down on the marshes? Checked out Dyfan Richard. His record's clean, but there was an incident on the marshes a few years ago. A run-in with a guy called John Clancy. He's in prison now. It was his boys that found the body. Yeah, exactly. Shall I go up there and find out what they know? Yes. Be careful. Did it hurt? The tattoo. A bit. Was it worth it? Obviously not. I bet you don't even know what it means. It's from Lord Of The Rings. Where were you on Monday night, Dean? I've already told you, I was down the arcade. That's not what I've been told. I was with a girl. Alys? In Aber. Does she have a name? Kirsten. Kirsten Reid. Kirsten? Does the name Dyfan Richard mean anything to you? Never heard of him. What about Wynford Rees? Alys and Mr Rees spent a lot of time together. He didn't love her. And you did? Yeah. Clancy wasn't making any sense. I told him over and over I hadn't seen anybody take his horses... but he wouldn't accept it. I must've seen something. That was his take on it. What about the money you owed for the building work? It was nothing. Some slates on the roof, some plastering work. I did them a favour, paid the agreed price. That's not how they remember it. There was a deal. Clancy tried to renegotiate after the event. What sort of a man does that? He's in prison now, am I right? Yeah. The three boys are alone out there. It's a terrible thing. Seeing children abandoned like that. The eldest boy's 19. He's doing a good enough job. Yeah, I'm sure. And Mr Mathias? What sort of a job is he doing? Give him my regards. I spoke to Kirsten Reid. Dean's alibi checks out. How was she? Slow. Someone to see you in reception. Release him. Gwen? I want to see the place where Alys was found. That's not such a good idea. Please? Thank you. Ah! Shit! What is it, Lloyd? Wynford Rees used to lecture at Edinburgh Met, sir. I spoke to the department up there, he was moved on three years ago. Moved on? Why? Accusation of rape, sir. I want Wynford Rees picked up. And his wife, too. And make sure they keep them apart. Yes, sir. The charge was dropped. Why? The girl who made it, Chloe... ..she retracted the accusation. But you WERE sleeping with her? Yes. You took advantage of her. Just like you did with Alys. No. Alys was extraordinary. I stood by him. How did that make you feel, your husband, carrying on like that? I felt nothing. I-I knew he didn't love them. But were things different with Alys? Why are you defending him? Why did you say you were with him that night when you knew he was at the hotel with Alys? Because despite everything... ..I still love him. My husband may be a fool but he's not a killer. You seem very sure about that, Mrs Rees. Our marriage is a strong one. The only thing that can threaten it... ..is love. And Alys Thomas... ..didn't love my husband. "They baptised her in the way that they did at the time "and named her Blodeuwedd." There's another reading to the Blodeuwedd myth, isn't there, Mr Rees? It's not all virgins and flowers. She seduced me. You were her teacher! Blodeuwedd was created for the sole purpose of being the king's lover. If she wasn't going to be his, she wasn't going to be anybody's. And so she was condemned to an eternity of darkness and torment. Is that what you did to Alys? No... That's not how it was. How was it, then? I was attracted to her. Alys was everything I wasn't. Brave. Talented. Fearless. And when you took her out to the marshes, was she fearless then? I didn't take her out there. But you know where I'm talking about. You know Borth. You were at the hotel. The owner of the hotel, he heard shouting. What were you rowing about? I tried to end it. Go on. She phoned... ..demanding to see me... threatening to come to the house. She was going to confront my family. So I agreed to meet her. To tell her it was over? Yes. Why? Alys wasn't looking for a lover. She was looking for a father. Keep him in the cells. Were there any other men in your daughter's life, besides your husband? Older men? Did she ever talk about her lecturer? What about Dyfan Richard? Does that name mean anything to you? Why are you asking? What do you know about him? Keeps himself to himself. I've never had anything to do with him. But you've seen him about? Borth is a small place. What happened to you? Nothing. They're waiting for you. After you. I went up to the house. I saw your car. I respected you! Maybe I was wrong to. That's enough, Iwan! Go home. Tom, a word. Yaaarrrggghhh! You! You! It's you! Take him down to the cell! N-o-o-o-o-o-o! Is that necessary, sir? The man is grieving. He's lost his daughter, he's lost everything! I know him better than you do! Sir? Dyfan Richard complained about the family on the marsh 23 times in the last four months. That's once every three days. It's like he was watching them. I've got the phone records and reports. Watching? What? You said like he was watching them. Yes. That's what it says in the report. Watching. Tom, wait! Wynford Rees is downstairs. We have evidence, motive, a strong case. He was with her that night. They fought, she stormed off. He's the last known person to have seen her alive! Watching... Where are you going? Dyfan Richard spent his life watching Alys. Watching her every movement. Why? You don't believe me? I don't know what to believe. You went up there on your own. Did you sleep with her? Did you? Check the tape. Chwarae fe nol. Dyfan Richard. I can stand here for hours and never be bored. There's so much out there. She was your friend, wasn't she? Alys. I don't know. I didn't know her. Not really. You've been lying to me, Dyfan. Is that what you think? I think you've been watching Alys the whole time you've lived here. I think you've been watching the family. And me. You've been watching me, too, haven't you, Dyfan? Never a smile on those ruby red lips. It was you who phoned Iwan, wasn't it? Sent him up to the house. I expected better from you. Alys needed someone. Someone outside of it all. Outside of her life. Someone different she could talk to who wouldn't judge, or harm... or seek to influence her. And that was you? I probably needed the same. Were you in love with her? Ours was a friendship. Pure. How could I harm a hair on her head? She lit up my day. And I hope somehow... ..I managed the same for her. Did you kill her? No. Did you need to silence her, Dyfan? Did she become too much for you? Did she threaten to tell? I was prepared to ignore the rumours. But they seem to be true. You seem to possess a chequered past, Mr Mathias. I like to take an interest in those who take an interest in me. Apologies if I touched a raw nerve. Wait, Dyfan! Dyfan! Where the hell have you been?! Where I should've been since this investigation started. Have you questioned Wynford Rees again? No. Why not? Because despite being the most frustrating senior officer I've ever worked with, I think you might be right about Dyfan Richard. We saw the tape, sir. I need to search Dyfan Richard's house. What for? He's lied to us. Alys was there. It was Dyfan Richard that killed her, I'm sure of it. We don't have any hard evidence. All I want is to search the house. He admits Alys was there, so we have grounds. I'm not going to apply for a warrant on a hunch. No. With consent. Get him to let you in. If you find anything significant, then I'll back that up with a warrant. It's him. What now? We'd like you to come to the station so we can confirm a few details. Helping the police with their enquires. Something like that. I'll need a solicitor. Of course. What do you do with all these models? I don't see any miniature railway. There was a break-in. They smashed it all to pieces. It was really upsetting for me. Now I make models to order. For others' pleasure. Sir. Nothing. The place is clean. Go back to the station and tell Prosser. If I'm wrong, I'll interview Wynford Rees on my return. I don't think you're wrong, sir. Just keep him as long you can, OK? I'll do my best. This is DCI Mathias. You said Dyfan Richard owed money to your father for building work? That's right. When was this? Two years ago. How well do you know the building? Better than anyone else. Why? Good. Come with me. What about my brothers? I'll take care of them. It's like a warren in there. Is it? Have we met before? I thought you were stealing my horses. I didn't meant to take the photograph. I just wanted to find out who you were. I didn't mean to hit you. You didn't have to tell me that. I know. Does that make me stupid? I hope not. But I'd like that photograph back. Deal. I'm not what you think I am. I know what love is. What being close to someone feels like. You need to charge me or let me go. Don't do that! Why not? What if someone calls the police? You haven't got a warrant! Through here. That's brilliant! Mared? Not good news. We had to let him go. 'Prosser refused to hold him any longer. 'Listen, Tom, I'm really sorry. 'Tom? 'Tom?' Get him back on the phone! Get a unit over to Gwen's place and another over to Dyfan Richard now! We're on it. Lloyd, with me, now! Come on, Gwen! Come on, pick up, please! Gwen! That night... ..Alys knocked on the door. She'd lost her phone. She couldn't get back into the hotel. She was upset. She'd missed the last train. I...invited her in. Said I'd phone a taxi. I never meant to kill her. She picked the model I'd made of her. She started to talk to it. Asking the model about me, about the "weirdo"...as she put it. "What's it like living with a weirdo?" I told her to stop. She just laughed at me. I held her. Both arms...and asked her to stop. She shrugged me off, told me where to go. And then she fell. Knocked her head against the table. I heard her neck snap. I wanted her to rest somewhere beautiful. Somewhere where I could see her every day. At the exact centre...of my world. Here. She looked so...beautiful. Why Gwen? Why did you do it? She brought her sordid ways to this sacred place. She should've been heartbroken. But she took you to her bed. I expected so much more of you. You killed her daughter, Dyfan. Hadn't you made her suffer enough? They should never have had that little girl. She should've been with me. Why? Why in this world should she be with you? Alys was my daughter. Now all I want is to be with her. I thought you were going to do it for me. But it looks like I'm going to have to do it for myself. No! Where are you? I'm in the marshes with Richard. I need an ambulance now! Lloyd! The ambulance is on its way! Hey! You OK? Gwen died...because of me. He's going to make it. Tom? Tom!
