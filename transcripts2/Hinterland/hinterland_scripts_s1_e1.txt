 Mathias? Sorry, sir, I didn't know. I wasn't here when you arrived. That's all right. DC Lloyd Ellis, sir. I've been looking forward to meeting you. Yes, just around the corner, sir. Keep to the left, please, sir. Morning. Hi. This way. Who's Johnny Cash? That's Eurof Daniel. Local preacher and friend of Helen Jenkins, the woman who lives here.

 Mrs? Miss. Mid 60s, devout chapel-goer. No children, no close family. Wasn't at chapel this morning. He came to check to see if she was OK, found the door wide open and the carnage inside. I'll need to speak to him. He already knows that, sir. You'll need these, sir. Thanks. You got a bag? James, bag. A broken tooth. Nasty. Vivid. Not my colour. Might be just another wild bath night in Aberystwyth, but I doubt it. DI Rhys.

 She's definitely not in hospital and there's no sign of her car, but we've mobilised all available personnel and checking all possible leads. What does she drive? Red Rover. Big enough to move a body? Yes, sir. That's cheerful. Huh? Salem, by Sydney Vosper. The devil's face is said to be hidden in the folds of the Welsh lady's shawl. My grandmother showed it to me when I was small. It still gives me the creeps. Do you see it? No. Perhaps you're not looking hard enough, sir. Perhaps I need the help of your grandmother. When was the last time you saw Helen Jenkins? Last Monday. You seem very sure about that. I see Helen every Monday. She cleans the chapel. Has done so for many years. Are you a regular visitor here, Mr Daniel? No. Helen likes her own company. Keen boat builder, was she? Not as far as I know. Someone she knows is. Can't imagine who. Where were you last night? At home. I, um... Can anybody verify that? Verify? Mr Daniel's wife passed away less than a year ago, sir. I'm sorry to hear that, Eurof. We'll be in touch. How long have you known him? Most of my life. He's a family friend. Good man? Absolutely. Further to fall, then. Oh, for God's sake! You can't suspect him. Excuse me, sir. The super's here to see you. Thank you, Ellis. You've met most of the team, then? A little sooner than expected. I've got half the cognoscenti of Aberystwyth in their Sunday chinos waiting to meet you up at the university. It's been a busy day, sir. Not every Sunday is like this. I hear you've already mobilised most of the police resources of west Wales. Do you have a body? Not yet. Well, it's a big call for a missing person. It was a vicious attack, sir. And if the victim is Helen Jenkins, she's already lost a great deal of blood. Unless she's had medical attention in the last 12 hours, as far as I'm concerned, this is a murder inquiry. OK. Keep me informed. I will. Thank you, sir. Forensics say there may be three or four different shoe marks in the hallway of the chalet. There's no sign of forced entry or anything to suggest that it was a robbery that went wrong, so perhaps she knew her assailant. Sorry I'm late, sir. DS Owens. Don't be late again. I won't be, sir. Saturday night, Helen Jenkins lays out some clean clothes and takes a bath. She puts on some red lipstick. She wants to look nice. For who? The boat builder? Or the preacher? But for some reason is attacked violently. Her teeth are knocked out. Stabbed? No weapon has been found, but the excessive blood loss would suggest that kind of attack. So there's a struggle. The Vosper painting is smashed, then she's dragged outside, put in the back of the car and driven into the night. Why? For dumping, sir? Possibly, if she's already dead. And if not? The killer wanted her to suffer. Find out all you can about Helen Jenkins. From what we can gather, she lived a quiet, frugal existence. But who does she know? And more importantly, who might have a motive strong enough to want to hurt her so badly? Yes, sir. I've already done a bit of homework on Helen Jenkins, sir. She ran the Pontarfynach Children's Home from 1979 till it closed in '96. It's now the Devil's Bridge Hotel, sir. Devil's Bridge? On the A4120 out of Aber, sir. It's about 20 minutes away to the southeast. Hm. It's as clear as day when you know what you're looking for. If you don't eat your greens, we'll send you to Devil's Bridge. I was scared stiff of the place when I was a kid. How come? According to legend, it's where the devil was tricked by an old lady. One day, an old lady and her cow got separated. She was on one side of the river, the cow was on the other. While she was standing there wondering how to get it back, the devil appeared and offered to build her a bridge. But his price was the soul of the first living thing to cross it. She agreed. Next morning, bingo! There's a bridge. The devil says, "I've kept my promise, now you keep yours." The old lady took a loaf of bread out of her basket, threw it across the bridge and her dog ran after it. So the devil was tricked by an old lady. Yep. The devil was so embarrassed, he never set foot in Wales again. Some would say that he never left. Check out the back. Hello? 'Alfie!' 'Alfie!' Alfie! The bugger doesn't listen to a word I say. My dog. He's down there somewhere. Oh, he'll come back when he's ready. Get that. I'll see you in my office at 5:00. Why haul the body all the way out here? Why risk getting caught? Maybe it wasn't pre-planned. He thought she was dead and panicked when he realised she was still alive. Alive or dead, the killer was making a statement. He was bringing Helen Jenkins home. You'd be pushed to call this home. Not if you're the devil. I need the name of all of the kids that went through the home during the time Helen Jenkins ran it. The children, staff, anyone connected with the place. I want to know who they were and where are they now. We're already working on it, sir. Good. Dr Haydn Blake's on his way in. Helen Jenkins was his cleaner for three years. I'll send someone down to talk to him. No. You do this one yourself, Tom. Haydn's a good friend, plays a big part in our community here. He'll appreciate the personal touch. Right, sir. Helen was our cleaner. She worked at the surgery for three years. She was good. But we started to notice money was missing. How much? Only small sums. Ł10 here, Ł20 there. But it added up over the months. So, you sacked her? It wasn't just the money. She started handing these out to some of my patients. Young women mostly. Warning them of the perils of sin. I couldn't allow that. And when was this? Six months ago. Pity. New cleaner's not a patch on Helen. Thank you very much, Dr Blake. We missed you this afternoon. At our little gathering. You were there? We were all there. Yep? Excuse me, sir. I've been looking into Miss Jenkins' accounts, sir. No major debts, no mortgage. Makes regular small contributions to the chapel fund. Forensics? Thanks. Ł50 usually. Less in recent months. She lost her job. But she made two other payments, sir. Big ones in April and September. Both of Ł500 and both to a Hywel Maybury. He works at the amusements on the pier, sir. Good work. How's your accommodation, sir? Perfect, thank you, DC Ellis. How's yours? Um...very good, sir. Thank you. "The night is far spent, the day is at hand. "Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness "and let us put on the armour of light." Not what you want to hear in the doctor's surgery on a Monday morning with two screaming kids. A religious zealot? Or a devout woman who sincerely believed she was helping. Whilst stealing the petty cash? Where's the quote from? St Paul to the Romans. You went to Sunday school. Perhaps I still do, sir. Hywel Maybury? Hywel Maybury's flat is on the first floor. Any idea of his movements? I can't say. Hywel is that quiet, it's hard to tell if he's in or not. Try, Mr Latimer. Well, I let his mam in last Tuesday, if that's any help? His mother? Yeah. She comes in every week to clean. His mammy cleans for him, does she? Well, I think so. Did he have any other visitors? Girlfriend...? Coch-y-bonddu. Classic trout fly. Good, isn't he? You into fishing, Inspector? No. Sir? Is this Hywel Maybury? Yes. And that's his mam. Helen Jenkins was brutally assaulted in her own home, then taken to Devil's Bridge, where we believe she was dumped in a river. She ran Pontarfynach Children's Home between 1979 and 1996. And we're very keen to speak to ex residents at the home, especially Hywel Maybury, who we believe was a close acquaintance of Miss Jenkins. The victim's car, a red Rover 100, registration N347 EP0, was used by the killer to move her. The car is still missing and it is vital that we find it. Any questions? Helen Jenkins cleaned for Maybury, gave him money. Was she his lover? Is that why she wore the lipstick? Maybe the lipstick wasn't for him and he got jealous? Or was she the mother he never had? Helen Jenkins had several assistants at Pontarfynach, but it seems she was the only one who lived in. How many children went through there during Helen Jenkins' time? Almost 50. Apart from Hywel Maybury, how many have you traced? Er...seven so far. No, eight. Only one still in Aberystwyth. Most have moved away, sir. Getting as far away from the place as possible, if you ask me. But we're not asking you. It's just an opinion. If you're unhappy, I suggest... I didn't say I was unhappy, I... Just give us the facts, Sian, please! I didn't mean to snap. Where were we? Catrin John. She's the only one we've traced who's still in Aberystwyth. She lives on the Glanrhyd estate now. Number? 32. We're talking to everyone who knew Miss Jenkins, trying to get an idea of her movements over the last week or so. The Pontarfynach kids are a good place to start. Plenty of them will be glad she's dead. Including you? Once, definitely. Not now. What's changed? Me. I've made something of my life. Nice house, happy marriage. And a baby. My little Awen, yes. That bad start made me what I am. Now I'm a mother, so something good came out of it. Hm. Have you had any contact with Helen Jenkins recently? No. She's part of my past. I'd rather she'd stayed there. Did she treat you badly? There were rumours of cruelty. They were true. And not just to the kids either. She was horrible to everyone there. Especially Byron. Byron? Byron Rodgers. Odd-job man and gardener. Did anything she told him. Does Byron still live locally? I've no idea, sorry. Where were you last Saturday evening? I was...here. Can anyone vouch for that? Only Awen. But she can't talk yet, bless her. Where was your husband? Dyfed? Away. Singing. He's in a choir. I'm really sorry, but Awen's due her feed. Do you mind if I see to her? No, not at all. Carry on. Tidy in there. Very. My house was a tip when my daughter, Elin, was a baby. Elin. Nice name. She's a nice girl. I hope you're not looking for guests. Business bad? Bloody awful. And bodies in the ravine won't help. Horrible. We should never have bought this place. We? Me and Daf. Daft bugger. When was that? '98. You should have seen the place when we moved in. The authority couldn't afford the repairs, so they just locked up and walked away. It was six months before we were able to take our first paying guests. How many rooms? 15. Staff? Just me. Getting people out here is a bit of a nightmare. What's through there? Top floor. Daf had big plans, but they didn't include dying. It's not been touched. It's still the Pontarfynach Children's Home up there. Celtic? What? That spiral. Looks more like a Walnut Whip to me. The kids who were here, we assumed. The authority promised to take it all away. Looks like case notes. Can I take these? Take 'em all, love. I hate it up here. Daf used to tease, but I swear... ..some nights... I'll leave you to it. Everyone who's stayed here in the last three years is in there. Perfect, can I borrow this too? Be my guest. Thanks. Hope you catch him soon. See if any of the names in there match those on the Pontarfynach list. And find me a Super 8 projector. Super 8, sir. Right. Dyfed Williams was exactly where Catrin says he was - choral trip to Lampeter. Coach dropped him off just after half-eleven on Saturday. Read this. Any progress? Getting there, but it's slow. These all joined the army... these emigrated, or moved abroad. These...? Dead. Any news on Byron Rodgers? Does odd jobs around the place, sir. We've got an address for him. Listen to this - "...is bed-wetting now on a nightly basis... constant "demands for attention... confined to Hard Room for weekend". "Hard room"? Signed Helen Jenkins. No wonder they hated her. Byron Rodgers? Yes? Have you got a minute? I'd like to talk to you about Helen Jenkins. I looked after the house and gardens. Drove the mini-bus to the chapel on Sundays. Did you and Helen get on? She was my boss. That's not what I asked. Yes. I got on with her. When did you last speak with her? I haven't spoken to her in years. But you were her right-hand man. I was just doing my job. Do you remember Hywel Maybury? Yes. Did Helen Jenkins treat him differently to the other children? Differently? Well, did she favour him more - mistreat him more - than the others? No. Did you agree with her methods? It wasn't my place to agree or disagree. When was the last time you saw Maybury? The day the home closed. Anyone else from the home? Where were you Saturday night? Here. Alone? Yes. Doing what? Working on this. Have you ever built a boat? Why would I need a boat? I found that motor car VRN Nov. 347 Echo, Papa, Oscar. Refers to a Rover 100, red in colour registered to a Helen Jenkins. Yeah, that's received from Delta Charlie zero four. Catrin John's best friend at the home was Jenny James. They were quite a pair. The tabloids christened them "Satan's Daughters". 1987, they set light to their school. Both had records for difficult, violent behaviour. Pontarfynach was last chance saloon. Next stop the remand home. Helen Jenkins made an off-the-cuff comment about them being proof of innate evil, original sin and the need to drive out the devil. The press leapt on it. Salem. She said that they were possessed, but actually they were just two nine-year-old foster kids, who'd been badly let down by the system. Jenny James... Regular customer over the years, sir. Minor stuff mostly - petty theft, D&D.; Initially we traced her to an address in the Grangetown area of Cardiff, but I double-checked. And...? She's back in Aberystwyth. Not far from the harbour. Does Jenny James live here? Now what...? Last time I saw her was Saturday morning. We had a row. What was it about? What it's always about. This, this...and this. She'll be back in a day or so. In a right mess - "I'm so sorry, Lee. Please forgive me, Lee." Yeah, right. Till the next time. Only, she's never stayed away this long before. She sleeps in here when we've had a ruck which is like always these days. Did you run out of paint? I was trying to cheer her up a bit. She went mental, ranting on about how she didn't deserve nothing apart from a hard room. And then she just buggered off. I just want her to be happy. We'll need a photo. It was mischief. A prank. But the papers made out it was some sort of Satanic ritual. The truth is, Jenny and I were never taught the difference between right and wrong. Until you met Helen Jenkins? She certainly thought she knew the difference - and how to teach us. Why didn't you mention this before? Didn't seem relevant. It was such a long time ago and we were kids. When the home closed, I wanted to get as far away from it as possible. I knew I'd been bad but it seemed like an ideal moment to make a new start. Problem was, Jenny couldn't. She got in with the wrong crowd and we went our separate ways. But you were close once? Once. She was the only friend I had in the world, Mr Mathias. Agnes? Maybury! I need to talk to someone. Mathias. You'd better get back here as soon as possible, sir. Why, what is it? Jenny James has just turned herself in. She says she killed Helen Jenkins. Why were you hiding there, Hywel? Were you scared? Were you running away because you did something you were ashamed of? Did you kill Helen Jenkins, Hywel? How did you kill her? I hit her. With what? A vase. Smashed her head in. Knocked the bitch's teeth out. Why did you do that? She took out our teeth with no anaesthetic, liked seeing us suffer. I gave her a taste of her own medicine. Then what did you do? Stabbed her. Dragged her out the front door and put her in the car. What sort of car? A little red one. Then I drove it up to Devil's Bridge. And then what did you do? Stopped on the bridge. Pulled her out and shoved her into the river. Did you have help? No. You took her out of the car and lifted her over the parapet on your own? Yeah. You look happy the both of you. I was happy. She was happy. It was a happy day. Sounds lovely. Tell me about it. It was my birthday. So, I went out fishing... ..and I caught a sea bass and she cooked it for me. Helen? Did Helen cook the fish? Is that why you went round there on Saturday? So she could cook for you? What happened on Saturday, Hywel? I was scared. That's why I ran away. Did she do something that made you angry? It wasn't my fault. I went there, because I used to live there. To Helen's house? The hotel! We lived there once. It was our home. I thought I'd be safe. But nowhere's safe. They always spit in your face. Who does? Everyone! They blame me. It wasn't my fault! Did Helen blame you, Hywel? Is that why you were angry? Did she shout at you? Did she call you names? Is that why you hurt her? HYWEL! I didn't hurt her! I didn't touch her! I didn't. I didn't! That's enough. He was there. His waders match the prints in the chalet. He was there. Did he kill her? He's certainly capable of killing her. Whatever he did, whatever he saw, he's deeply traumatised by it. Could it be an act? No, no, I think it's genuine. DCI Mathias...? I'm sorry, but my client isn't in any fit mental state to be interviewed. I'd like him psychologically assessed before further questioning. With respect, I think you're being a little premature. Let me continue the interview if he breaks down again, then I'll... I'm sorry. It has to stop now. Ms Walters, this is a murder enquiry, our primary concern is, is to find the killer. Can I suggest that we trust the judgment of Dr Haydn Blake, our police surgeon in assessing Mr Maybury's fitness to continue? Feel free to use the phone in my office. Please. Jenny, hi. Do you know this picture? Yeah. She had one hanging on the wall at the home. Did she have one anywhere else? How would I know? Devil's Bridge is a long way to go with a body in the back of the car. Weren't you worried about being caught? Never thought about it. Why Devil's Bridge, Jenny? It's where she took us when we'd been bad. Down the bottom... said the Devil lived there. If we didn't repent - he'd take our souls and we'd burn in Hell for ever. Well, she's lying. There's a knack. Thanks. She's lying to protect someone. Who? Maybury? He was definitely at the scene. That's something else you'll have to get used to around here. Do you think I came here by choice? The official line is that you did, yeah. And unofficially? We're in luck. You can question Maybury again. Oh, thank you, sir. Dr Blake is a valuable resource to have at our disposal. So I see. Right, let's get on with it. I should have told her. Her...? Helen... Miss Jenkins. I should have told her and not been ashamed of what they'd say. She helped me. She gave me money and she hardly had any for herself. She cared for me. He had a boat. Who did? Her grandfather. He used to take her out in his boat. They used to catch fish and cook it on the fire. She said she was happy then. But when he died she lost the boat too. I said I'd build her a boat and take her out fishing, like she used to. To pay her back for helping me. I wanted her to know that I needed her to be like a mother is. And I wanted her to need me like a son... ..and she did. It was our secret... ..so I told nobody. But you've told us, Hywel, that's a good thing... ..because we're going to find out who hurt her. So, you need to tell us what happened, what you saw, when you went to Helen's house. Will you do that for us? Hywel... ..for Helen's sake? I'd been fishing... ..I caught two fish. I came up from the beach, to Helen's house. The door was open. Banging in the wind. I saw a car leave. Helen's car. Could you see who was driving? No. No, too dark. I went into the house. It was bad. There was blood. Where? On the floor. All over. The bathroom. Everywhere. Lots of blood. I ran away. I knew they'd blame me. But I didn't hurt her. I should have told her. Told her what, Hywel? I wanted to tell her, but I couldn't. I didn't kill her! I loved her. What shall we do about Jenny? We've still got plenty of time to question her. Let her stew for now, and we'll see what she has to say in the morning. Just think what kind of lives those kids would have had if their parents had done their job. It's not rocket science, just basic care. "Put your hand over your mouth when you cough." "Don't pick your nose in public." All that small stuff, it all adds up. The only thing a child needs is to feel safe and warm, and to know that they're loved. Scilly Automatic - northwest by north two, 27 miles. 1018, rising more slowly. Milford Haven - west, northwest two, 18 miles. 1017, rising slowly. Christ. Who pulled them out? You or Helen? What? It's a simple question. Who was it? Who pulled their teeth out? You or her? She did. Miss Jenkins. A lot of the children had bad teeth. They needed to come out. It wasn't worth bothering the tooth fairy for...? Or worth giving them anything for the pain? I didn't like her doing it. Perhaps I should have stopped her... So, why didn't you? Were you scared of her, too? Did she threaten to lock you in the Hard Room? Did she say that the Devil would come and take away your soul, that you'd burn in Hell for ever for your sins? I think she was murdered because of something that happened in that home, Byron. Something you know about. I didn't kill her. Then who did? I don't know. There's a pattern in the lawn at Pontarfynach. A... a spiral. You remember it? Yes. It's been there for years. What does it mean? It's about the journey you make. Between life and death. What happened at the home, Byron? You know something... and you are going to tell me. Emma Jones. I've been going through the hotel register, sir. And...? There's an Emma Jones who's been staying at the Devil's Bridge Hotel every year for the last three years. She stays in same room, on the same date. January 28th. Except for this year. The same day Helen Jenkins was killed? Yes, sir. She calls herself Emma Jones, but she uses the same address we traced Jenny James to in Grangetown. And you think that it might be her? Yes, sir, using a false name. I think you're right, Lloyd. Yes, room ten every January the 28th. She arrives at tea time, comes straight up here, emerges the next morning, has an early breakfast. "See you next year." Gone. And you've no idea why she comes on that particular date? No. And I've never asked. As long as she pays and doesn't nick the towels, I don't much care. Is this Emma Jones? No. What about her? When was this taken? When she was about 17. Well, she hasn't changed that much, yeah, that's her definitely - that's Emma Jones. Catrin John. You've got to talk to Jenny James. Do not release her, you got me? Arrest her if you have to, but Jenny James must not leave the premises... Ask her about Catrin - she's our Emma Jones. Where's Catrin? It's just a name she picked at random as far as I know. She was Catrin John when I met her. And Room ten? Every January the 28th? Why that room? That day? I don't know. Perhaps it was to remind herself of who she once was? Why would she do that, when she's tried so long to forget her past? I don't know. You don't seem to know much about your own wife at all, Mr Williams. I thought I knew her. Catrin only wanted to be married and have a family. But... Having a baby must have meant so much to you. Awen, isn't it? Yes. Where is she now? She's upstairs. Well, she's very quiet. Is she asleep? Yes. Can I see a photograph? I... took them all down. Why, Dyfed? I left Catrin two months ago. Where were you on Saturday night? I was singing with the choir. Minibus dropped me off outside, like always. Did you come into the house? I walked back to the B&B.; I tried to understand, I tried to protect her... ..but it's like there's a part of her locked away I just can't reach. Catrin was raped. At the home. She was 13 and she got pregnant. Who was it, Jenny? I don't know. Neither does she. You've no idea, have you? Not a clue what that place was like. We were drugged most of the time. Diazepam and pin-down. Locked up in the Hard Room, if we so much as raised our voices. Hard Room? On the first floor. That's where it happened. As soon as the baby started to show, Catrin was hidden away, out of sight. That's when she started to change. Wasn't interested in me any more, only her baby. She was everything to me... I was nothing to her after that. Nothing. And the baby? Catrin had the baby. Jenkins let her hold her for a bit. Then she took the little thing away. Catrin has never seen Emma since. Emma Jones. That was the baby's name. Fresh air? Just a walk round the block. Haven't you forgotten something? The baby? She's with Catrin. You said you were looking after her. I am. I was. Shall I go and check if she's there? No, please. I'd rather you didn't... Where's Catrin gone, Dyfed? I only lied because I love her... I wrote to her when I was in Cardiff, told her how much I missed her. She never wrote back. So I came back to see her. But she wasn't interested in me. All she wanted to know was what happened to Emma. I told her. I didn't know where her baby was... She said she'd do to me what she'd done to Helen Jenkins if I didn't tell her... I was scared... ..she was going to kill me... I just told her... What did you tell her, Jenny? Byron Rodgers. Interview suspended 18:10. The more we can get out of Dyfed about Catrin the more likely we are to find her. Get Ellis to meet me outside Byron Rodgers's house... I'm on my way. Lloyd. Byron...? Ambulance please, Wine Street, SY23. Catrin got here first. I've mobilised all units and alerted the press, Catrin John is an extremely disturbed individual. She has killed once and is likely to kill again.... Catrin and Jenny both suffered at the hands of the gutter press as children. I'm just asking that we keep this low-key, restrained, sir. I can assure you, Tom, anything I issue to the press will reflect your concerns. That's all I ask. Thank you. JENNY! Catrin wanted a baby more than breath... Tried for years. And then it just happened. Suddenly she was pregnant and it was like Christmas every day. She was so happy. Three weeks before full term, the baby stopped moving. She had the scan and... Baby had died. Called her Awen. She insisted on keeping the nursery and going through the whole routine... feeding, changing nappies. On a doll. Then she became obsessed by Emma. Had to find her. As if it would compensate, somehow, for the loss of Awen. I couldn't hack it. Maybe if I'd tried harder, Helen Jenkins would still be alive. Byron Rodgers is in theatre now, sir. Touch and go, I'm afraid... Any news on Catrin? Nothing yet, sir. Will you come and help me find Catrin? Hello, Emma. Is something wrong? You've never missed before. That room is very special to me. I was a mother here... ..in room ten. For the first time in my life I knew what it was like to be loved. But I lost her. Are you all right? Why don't you come inside for a while? You can go into the room. Sir, we found Catrin John's car, it was abandoned in the woods at Devil's Bridge. Tell Agnes to lock all the doors, and get any units we have up there now. I'm on my way. Sir, wait. What? Byron Rodgers didn't make it - he died half an hour ago. Stay here, don't move. Agnes? Agnes? Agnes? Oh, God, am I glad to see you! Where's Catrin? I saw her in the garden, we talked and she flipped. When she saw one of the prints in the hotel she smashed it to pieces... and she dragged me up here. Where has she gone? Catrin? I want her in a stab-vest. Jenny? She's our backup if Plan A fails. She knows Catrin better than any of us. I know it's a risk but... I'll take full responsibility. You know we shouldn't be doing this. Come on, Mared! Right, let's do it then. Just make sure that everyone stays back. No, Catrin, don't... What are you doing here? I'm here to help you. This is between me and Mr Daniel. Mr Daniel doesn't know where Emma is. But I might be able to find her. How? I'm a detective. Finding people is what I do. We've already started looking for her. Where? Give me the scissors, then we can go and find her together. I'm not going to hurt you, trust me. I don't trust anyone, they just... Was it you?! Was it you who raped me?! No... no, it wasn't me. He hurt me... Jenny heard him... ..she tried to help me. She loves you. I know. Right, you're coming with me. She misses you... ..that's why she's come with me to see you. She's outside, waiting to talk to you. Would you like to see her? Give me your hand, and we'll go out together to see her. No! Catrin, it's OK... Jenny! No! Are you out there? I've got to talk to her. Please, let me go in and talk to her. No, it's too risky. You're lying, she's not out there. JENNY! Jenny, stop! JENNY! Catrin! We've been looking for Catrin, haven't we, Jenny? Yeah, we have. I've missed you. I've been looking for Emma. I know. I can't find her. Byron wouldn't tell me. I didn't want to hurt him, but he just wouldn't say. He didn't know, Catrin, that's why. Then why did you tell me he did? Because I was scared... I thought you'd hurt me. Jenny. As if. But I know now. I know where Emma is. Where? They took her away. And I could hear you screaming for her. I was under the stairs. You know that little place where we used to hide? Where is she, Jenny?! Where is my baby? I went into the room... ..where little Emma was. She was asleep... ..and she was beautiful. So beautiful. And I knew... ..that you'd love her more than me... ..and I didn't want you to stop loving me. I was afraid that she'd take my place... ..a little angel. So I took her breath away... So that she'd be with the angels. Always with the angels. And I would be with you. No. It's the truth. I did it because I love you. I love you. Helen told me the child had died in its sleep. I had no reason not to believe her. She thought that the bad publicity would lead to the closure of the home. She begged me not to say anything. I...blessed the child...and the ground... ..and then we laid her to rest. We buried her. Myself, Helen and Byron. I think I know where. Byron was trying to tell us.
