 Can you think of anyone that would want to harm you or your family, Mr Davies? 'Please, 'I shouldn't be here.' I should be with my wife and son. 'I can't do this any more.' - Thank you, DS Owens. - Yes, ma'am. You're back? I'm back. Good. There's plenty of work to do. I didn't expect to see you again. You miss me? Is that all you've got to say? I'm sorry. That was the hospital. The little boy's dead. Wil was a lovely child. Always smiling. Such a... beautiful boy. Are you close to your sister? Yeah. Always have been. Especially since Dad died. Your father ran Cwmglas Timber, didn't he? - Yeah. - And what happened after he died? We pulled together as a family to make things work. Who did? Me, Mari and Rhodri. But your sister, Mari, and Rhodri - they got the business, didn't they? - Yeah. - Did that hurt? Mari's the eldest. Dad was old-fashioned like that. I got the house. What's your relationship with Rhodri like? Good, why? You don't think he had anything to do with this? Are you aware of any difficulties between Rhodri and your sister? No, none. Where were you on the night of the fire, Siwan? At home. Alone. Mr Pryce? Alun Pryce? Where is everyone? - Nobody wants to come in, not after what happened. - Apart from you? There are things need doing. Were there any financial difficulties on-site? I don't know. Don't think so. That's Rhodri's business. I understand you've had some trouble at the site - vandalism, break-ins. That's right. Any idea who could have been responsible? What did they take? They didn't take anything. You don't think that's odd? I don't get paid to think. - What about Mr Davies? - What about him? Has he upset anyone? Any disputes, any enemies? Not that I know of. - How well do you know him? - I work for him, he's the boss. - Where were you on the night of the fire? - At home. Thank you for your time. That's it for now. Is Mari going to be OK? She going to pull through? Let's hope so. I used to come up here as a kid. The place has changed. Goodnight. Yep. Goodnight. Hello? I'm glad you could make it. It's usually peaceful here. This time of night. So... how are you settling back? Slowly. It can't be easy. Coming back to a case like this. If you ever need to talk about it... Why am I here? Always to the point. I want you to take over from DI Rhys as Senior Investigating Officer. What about DI Rhys? We all have to carry our pack, Tom. Do I have a choice? I'll endorse the policy book tomorrow. Everything all right, sir? What are you doing here? I couldn't sleep, I thought I'd come to check on Mari. Someone else had the same idea. Check CCTV. - Is that it? That's all we have? - That's all we have. What do you think? Someone trying to finish what they started? I've found something. I think it's important Cwmglas Forest extends to 100 acres of commercial woodland. Now, Rhodri Davies purchased an additional 200 acres of adjoining upland farmland, Yr Hen Glyn, at an auction nine months ago, with the intention of expanding the logging business and re-generating the land. Thereby transforming grazing land into profitable woodland. Sorry, Lloyd - re-generating the land? I call this the Red Zone. Anyway, the land came up for auction after the farm Yr Hen Glyn went bankrupt. The place had been in the family for generations, a thriving farm in its day, but there had been complaints recently of... Are there any names for these people? Iori Thomas, ma'am, 62. He'd been running Yr Hen Glyn farm for almost 30 years, but he has a son, Bedwyr, 31. What do we know about Bedwyr? Bedwyr Thomas has a criminal record for affray in 2010, more recently, an assault charge. Six months ago he assaulted Alun Pryce, site foreman for Cwmglas Timber. - Was anyone convicted? - No, all charges were dropped. Have we got an address for this guy? Not for him, but we have a home and work address for his father, lori Thomas. I didn't ask to run the case. Course you didn't. He came to me, Mared. Tell me, why is it women do the work, men get promoted? He's OK. Thank you. What do you want with me, then? We want to know where your son is, Mr Thomas. We need to ask him a few questions. I haven't seen Bedwyr in weeks. What can you tell us about Rhodri Davies? He doesn't understand this place, nor the people who live here. He took our farm. We lost everything. It's been too much for Bedwyr. He's taken it bad. If I was a younger man, I'd be angry too, I'm sure. But as you get older, there are some things that no-one can change, and greed is one of them. The man's son is dead, Mr Thomas. I can't help him with that. Hard work? You learn to live with it. You were involved in an incident six months ago with Bedwyr Thomas. It was nothing. 12 stitches above the left eye. That's hardly nothing, Mr Pryce. Bedwyr and me, we go back a long way, we've known each other since childhood. We fall out, like brothers. This time it got out of hand, that's all. I used to work for Bedwyr's father, lori. I helped down at Yr Hen Glyn on and off, did odd jobs, whatever needed doing. It wasn't much, but it was a job. I finished there about 18 months ago when I got offered a permanent job here. Better pay? I needed the money. For my mother's care. Help my father out best I can. It's been difficult for him. So, what happened... with Bedwyr? Trouble started when they lost the farm. Bedwyr went off the rails, started saying that I turned my back on him. I was in the pub one night, Bedwyr had had a couple of pints, started having a go at me. - About what? - Nothing, just drunk, he was. Do you think it was Bedwyr that started the fire? I dunno. You'd better ask Bedwyr. - You all right? - Ah! Yeah, I'm fine you go. Sorry. Nothing out the back, sir. It's clean. Dead animals? Why would Bedwyr take pictures of dead animals? Maybe it wasn't him who took the pictures. Why keep them, then? There was an accusation, about a year or so ago. Poisoned animals, problems in the Red Zone. Tried to tell you, sir. Nobody takes any notice of me, do they? Where's Rhodri? He's at my place. He hasn't slept in three days, I told him to get some rest. Why? What's happened? Are you OK? I'm fine. You need to get that looked at. I'll go to talk to Rhodri. I want to find out who killed your son. But you're going to have to help me do it. Where did you get these? Yr Hen Glyn. Bedwyr Thomas used to live there. - You bought his father's farm. - Yeah, at auction, and I paid over the odds for it. Any ideas why Bedwyr would want to take photographs of dead animals? - I don't know. - Don't lie to me, Rhodri. Him and his father accused me of poisoning their animals. Said I was trying to get them off their land. Were you? - No. - Somebody was, that's why he kept a record. Do you think Bedwyr was behind the attacks on the business? Him and one or two others. Yeah. You're not very popular around here, are you? It wasn't easy, taking over from Mari's Father. - Hard act to follow? - Yeah, you could say that. He was a good man. But the business was failing. Until you came along? Not everyone appreciates what I've tried to do. Does Mari? Not always. But this place... It's in her blood. It's all she's ever known. Did Bedwyr ever come to the house? - No. - But you were scared that he might. Does that explain the locks on the front door? We felt safer that way. You have no idea what these people are capable of. - "These people"? - I've never been welcomed around here. Wil made me feel like I belonged. When was the last time you saw Bedwyr? A couple of weeks ago. I stayed up in the site all night. It was the only way of stopping them attacking our property. - He was there? You saw him? - He was outside. - Are you sure it was him? - I heard him breathing. It was Bedwyr If you don't mind... I have a son to bury. I told him to throw them away. No point keeping them after we'd already lost the farm. He can't let it rest. I need to find him. Fast. Ten years ago this place was a school. It's just me here now. I've lost my wife, I've lost the farm. I don't want to lose my son. - Bedwyr's asthmatic, isn't he? - Yes. - Does he smoke? - No. - Somebody with him does. Listen, lori, Bedwyr's going to be blamed for everything... so help us find him. They used to be good friends. Bedwyr's always known right from wrong. - Is that him there? - Yes. That's Alun Pryce. Him and Bedwyr, thick as thieves. Like brothers. That's Mari and Siwan. Who's this? Who's this other boy? Dafydd Hughes? I'm looking for Bedwyr Thomas. I haven't seen him in ages. What about Rhodri Davies? What about him? Have you seen him? Why would I? We don't move in the same circles. And Alun Pryce? Not if I can help it. You don't see many people, do you, Mr Hughes? Where were you on the night of the fire? - What fire? - Oh, don't tell me, you were alone Yes. So you know nothing about it? No. Well, I need to find him before Rhodri does. Bedwyr's not afraid of Rhodri! You know that for a fact, do you? If Bedwyr does make contact, you will let me know, won't you? Put it down. - Put it down. Don't be stupid. - One move... and I'll kill you. - They know where I am. - Shut up! - You're only making it worse for yourself. - Shut up, I said! - Whoa! Cool Beds! - I'm not going down for something I didn't do! - Why did you run? - Cos I've got bigger battles to fight than this one. - Is that right? - They're demolishing Hen Glyn in a couple of weeks. - Over my dead body! Put the gun down, Bedwyr. And just tell me who murdered Wil. Who was it? I don't know. It had nothing to do with me. Where were you on the night of the fire? We were up on the farm... together. We drank all night. Put the gun down, Bedwyr, or you'll lose more than just the farm! I didn't kill Wil! I believe you. Just give me the gun. Rhodri knew if he could get us out the farm, we'd put up for auction. That's why he did what he did. What did he do? Poisoned our animals. Now he knows, doesn't he? Rhodri knows how it feels to lose something he loves. Mari and Siwan were the girls that everyone wanted to be with. It was taken up at the Crug... ..the summer after we all left school. It was the happiest time of my life... ..till Rhodri came and killed everything. No-one grows up here now. With Wil gone... ..it's over. Hey, Mam. What are you doing? Charcoal burning. Gets rid of all the hardwood waste. Does the soil good. Carry on. Carry on. Controlling the burn. That's the art. - Making the burn even. - You know an awful lot about fire, don't you, Alun? - Bit late to be out, isn't it? - I like working in the night. Never get lonely? - No-one to go home to? - No. - Really? There was someone... once. Was there? Who? Mari. So, that was you? It was you at the hospital? Answer me, Alun! I had to see her. I've loved her all my life. Enough to do her husband's dirty work for him? - You poisoned the animals. - I didn't do it for Rhodri. I did it for the money... ..for my mother's care. Mathias. We've always been here... ..Mam, Dad... ..me... ..Wil. Always. I've never wanted to be anywhere else. Dafydd Hughes, Bedwyr Thomas. Did you see any of them on the night of the fire? They didn't do it. Do you know who did? Did anyone come to the house, Mari? Did you see anyone? He was angry. Who was? We argued. I knew what he was doing. I tried to talk to him. I knew about Yr Hen Glyn... ..about the poisoning. About the money he'd borrowed. He's ruined everything. She's confused. She doesn't know what she's saying. But you needed the land, to expand your business. - I didn't poison the animals. - No, you got a man on the payroll to do it. - What if I did? That farm was over. - You drove people off their land. - I've only ever done what's right. - Right for who? - For Wil. For Mari. Wil was everything to me! - On the night of the fire, where were you? - Working. - Alone? - That's right. - Could you tell us about your marriage, Mr Davies? - Why? Because we're interested! - It's private. - This is a murder inquiry. Nothing's private. We had our arguments. About what? Money. The business. And how you were destroying everything her father stood for? I had no choice! I had nothing to do with the fire! I was not there! - Where were you, then? - I've already told you. - You were working? - Yes! - On your own? - Yes. - At the site? - Yes! No, Rhodri, that's not good enough! Mari blames you for everything. I know that. You know that. Why? - It's not true. - Don't lie to me, Rhodri. - I am not lying. - Tell me the truth. - It IS the truth! - Where were you on the night of the fire?! - I was with someone! Who? A woman. Who is she? Who was she, Rhodri? How long has the affair been going on? It doesn't matter any more. How long, Siwan? Five years. You're her sister. She means more to me than anything. I knew it would all fall apart one day... ..but not like this. We've gone too far. Lost so much. I just... ..wanted to be close to them. Do you think Siwan's lying about being with Rhodri on the night of the fire? Maybe they planned the whole thing together. Or he got someone to do it for him. First, the poisoning... - And, then, the fire? - No. No! Mari went out. She went somewhere. Where did she go?! How far does that thing go back? - What time is that? - Just after midnight. Stop. Wait. Go back. There. Mari knows. She knows about Rhodri and Siwan, she knows about the affair. She knows everything. There's no sign of her. She can't have gone far. Search the grounds, check with security, talk to the staff. I want to know where Mari went, what she was wearing, what kind of mood she was in. Go back to the station. - Rhodri Davies is not to be released. - We've already released him. - What? When? Well, we need to find him and Siwan. They need to be warned! - Where's Mari? - Does it matter?! We need to find her. She could be in danger. She knows. Mari knows about the affair. She walked out of the hospital, so we need to find her before she harms - herself or anybody else. - You told her! She knew. No. Tell me Mari had nothing to do with the fire. We need to find her. Tell me Mari had nothing to do with the fire! Mari? Tom? - Tom?! - I'm all right. She was here. We missed her. She can't have gone far. She's on foot. The Crug? I know the way. Mari. Alun! Alun's truck? - It looks like it. - Why leave it there? This way. Mari... please. Mari! Mari. Alun, leave now, please. Go. Now! I know what it's like to lose a child, Mari. That emptiness. Pain that never leaves you. I... I lost my daughter. She was the same age as Wil. She drowned. I was... I was there. It was my fault. I just turned away for a second and... ..when I turned back, she... She was gone. My little girl. Please, Mari... Please give me your hand. I can't. Hi. I'd like to speak to DCI Mathias. And you are? I'm his wife.
