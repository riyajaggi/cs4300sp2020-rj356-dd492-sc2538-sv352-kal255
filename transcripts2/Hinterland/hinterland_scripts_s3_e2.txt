 -[Robert] Were you seen? -I wasn't seen. There are no witnesses. [Robert] Iwan Thomas's death will need to be investigated. An independent officer will be sent to run the case. You need to make them welcome. Give them all the assistance they need. I thought you had this covered. I thought so too. Devil's Bridge, huh? Of all places! I wasn't... I lost control. There's no use in panicking. Now... we'll just have to wait and see how it all plays out. Go home, get some sleep.

 And get up in the morning, put on a clean shirt, and go to work like nothing has happened. -Blake needs to know. We need to tell him. -I'll speak to Blake. You just go home. There's nothing we can do about this now. Thank you. Call came in about an hour ago. -[Mared] SOCO? -Settin' up now, ma'am. [Mared] Who found her? [Lloyd] A couple of young poachers. They got the fright of their lives. -[Mared] Where's DCI Mathias? -We haven't been able to reach him, ma'am. We've taken the boys' statements, ma'am. We sent 'em home. [footsteps] DC Ellis called. Looking for you, sounded urgent. Thanks. [Lloyd] Her name is Laura Dean. Her boyfriend came in yesterday, reported her missing. She worked as a curator at the art college on the hill. [Mared] Have you spoken to them yet? [Lloyd] We're due to this morning. We've only had it a few hours. -[Mared] Where the hell have you been? -Sorry, I... What have we got? Laura Dean, 24. Two poachers found the body just after midnight. Then I tried calling you. She was strangled, sir. She was found naked, buried in a plastic sheet. Forensics are working on her now. She said she was going to Manchester for the weekend to stay with an old college friend. Her boyfriend reported her missing yesterday when she didn't arrive back. -When did he last speak to her? -Friday. When he called the friend yesterday, turns out the two hadn't spoken in years. -What's his name? -[Lloyd] Boyfriend's called Ifan Riley. [knocking at door] Mr. Riley? [Mathias] When was the last time you spoke to Laura? Friday morning. Before I left for work. She didn't call to say that she'd arrived? We don't always call. I just wanted her to have a good time. Was she away a lot? Only when she's cataloguing an art collection. Sometimes she'd stay over to save the driving. Wednesday, she was... at a gallery opening in Caernarfon. Alone? Yes. Are you sure? -I spoke to her before she went to bed. -And what time was that? About 10:00. Where? -Sorry? -Where did you find her? We found her in the woods near Trefenter. We need to try and create a picture of what happened to her. Is there anyone else we should speak to? Friends? Colleagues? Naomi. In the college. I don't know her second name. [phone rings] Cambria Police. [sighs] -Naomi Harries? -[woman] She's here somewhere. [Mared] I'll find her. You check Laura's office. Naomi Harries? [Naomi] Can I help you? DI Mared Rhys, DCI Mathias. [Mathias] When was the last time you saw her? Um... Thursday. The day after the gallery opening in Caernarfon? She never mentioned it. Did she mention that she was going for a weekend away to visit friends in Manchester? She... She was seeing someone. Who? -Lewis John. -The artist? He'd asked her to model for him. Was she having an affair? I don't know. Maybe she made it out to be more than it was. She'd stopped telling me. I couldn't keep lying for her. Ifan adored her, but he was so careful with her. These sketches of Laura... Is that Lewis John's work? She was infatuated by him. [Mared] Mrs. John? Is your husband here? Lewis is in his studio. Where? Do you have time for some questions? Of course. [Lewis] Can I help you? Lewis John? [Lewis] Yes. I'd offer you a drink, but it's probably a bit early for you, isn't it? Just a bit, yeah. Beautiful, aren't they? It takes years to perfect form, to lose the rough edges. I keep them to remind me. Oh, yeah? About? Perfection. [Mathias] All these paintings, are they Laura Dean? You're not sure? [snorts] The world's obsessed with who people are. I paint what they are. But you knew who she was? [Lewis] Was? We found her body this morning. She's been murdered. When did you last see Laura? Wednesday night. She came to the house and she sat for my husband. They worked late. She stayed the night. In the studio? Yes. -And she left on Thursday morning? -Yes, before breakfast. Did you see her leave? No. Did you or your husband speak to her after that? No. Where was your husband on Friday night, Mrs. John? In the studio. Working. Repainting. Changing old work. Part of the process. Was he alone? Yes. He was alone. All night? All night. [Lewis] I found her beguiling. Very beautiful. [Mathias] Did you sleep with her on Wednesday night? -Yes. -[Mathias] And not for the first time? No. I was attracted to her, and she was to me. She'd undress, she'd sit for me, and... Sometimes we had sex. Sometimes not. Part of the process. [sighs] If that's how you'd like to describe it, yes. Did you sleep with all your models? No, not all of them. Did you know that Laura had a boyfriend? I never asked her, and she never said. But you were close. Laura sat for me. The rest of the time, I... She lived her own life. According to one of Laura's friends, your relationship with her was more than just sexual. [Lewis] It wasn't more or less anything. It was about putting a form in paint on canvas. [exhales] You think Laura understood that? I have no idea what Laura thought. What happened between us was consensual. It... It was natural. Does your wife know? My wife and I share everything. [Mared] Were you happy with that arrangement? Are you always happy? With your husband? I'm not married. I stopped judging my husband a long time ago. It's what's made our marriage survive. There have always been models. They're his tools. The raw material. He needs to make the work. If he didn't produce the work, we'd have nothing to sell. So Laura was just one in a long line then? I'm afraid so. [banging on door] [door opens] Iwan Thomas, sir. We've had a call from a member of the public. A possible sighting of his car. Where? [indistinct voices over police radios] Hello? [Agnes] So the devil has returned to Devil's Bridge. [Mathias] Hello, Agnes. [Mathias] Last night, did you hear anything? [Agnes] The storm woke me up, but that's nothing new. [Mathias] No guests? [Agnes] No. The place is cursed, always was. I've put it up for sale. Who is it this time? I can't say. [Mared] Tom? Tom? Prosser's outside, wants to speak to you. OK. If you do remember anything, just... I've still got your number. Tom. You can't be here. Sir? You're too involved. What do you mean? You know how it works. We'll have to bring someone in. Sir, with respect, I'm the best person to conduct this case. Tom, you're part of an ongoing investigation, the main subject of which has just been found dead. DS Owens will oversee things now until an independent investigator arrives. An independent investigator? It's procedure. We have to do this properly. My hands are tied. Go back and work on the Laura Dean case. See it through. I'll brief you as appropriate. [door closes] -Tom? -Yeah? Where were you last night? I was out. I was out looking for Iwan Thomas. Did you find him? Mared, I wish I had. [phone rings] What is it, Lloyd? He's there now? We're on our way. I needed to see the place. I loved her. I don't understand why that wasn't enough. Come on. She was seeing somebody else, wasn't she? Did he do this to her? Where'd you find him? In the ravine, at Devil's Bridge. Iwan didn't kill himself. He found him, didn't he? He came to see me last night looking for Iwan. Who? Your boss. Mathias. Move it forward. Ifan was waiting for Laura for hours just like he said. Sir, Lewis John. Nine years ago, a 17-year-old brought an accusation against him. Sexual assault. No charges were ever brought against the artist, and the case was shelved. We just had the initial notes and statements. -What was her name? -Joanna Miller. She's currently working as a cook in Aberystwyth. [Mathias] Well done, Lloyd. [Prosser] The focus of the inquiry will be on DCI Mathias. After the attack, he's already in the frame. [Blake] That doesn't help us. Robert and I have both agreed. It would be cleaner if it was ruled a suicide. That way, we can put it to bed. All of it. What do we know about this investigator they're sending? They'll send who they want to send. I have no control on it. What about the cousin, Gareth Thomas? Does he know anything? Iwan was a drinker. He could have said all sorts of things about us. -About the children's home. -Yes, I know. What the hell were you thinking? You'll put all of us at risk. Can I help you? Oh, if you're looking for DCI Mathias, he's not here. I wasn't looking for him. I'd like to speak to you. -Joanna Miller? -Yeah. I'm DCI Mathias, this is DI Rhys. We need to ask you some questions about Lewis John. It was years ago. I have nothing to do with him now. It's in the past. Maybe you can help us with something that isn't in the past. One of his models, Laura Dean... [Mared] She was found dead during the early hours of this morning. I've said all I want to say about him. It's on record. It was a lifetime ago. It's OK. If you do decide to say anything, just give us a call. [Lewis] It was a long time ago. But you remember her? Joanna Miller? She brought an assault charge against you. She was 17 years old. And then retracted it. [Mared] But you admit to having a naked 17-year-old in your studio. She wasn't naked. Joanna developed a crush on my husband. We were both aware of it and did our best to bring the arrangement to an end. Did it work? Jo mistook my interest in her as something more. When Lewis's work was done, she couldn't understand why he didn't need to see her anymore. She couldn't handle it and lashed out. She was just 17 years old, same age as my daughter. -Then you'll understand. -Will I? Was Laura Dean in love with you, Mr. John? No. It... It wasn't that. She was special. She was vulnerable, like Jo Miller. [Mrs. John] You've no idea what these girls are like. We've all been guilty of attention seeking, one time or another. [Lewis] I paint what's inside. Once I've seen it and... I've painted it, I... I move on. Do you really believe you can see inside people? I... I'd like to think I do, yes. Would you like him to paint you, Mr. Mathias? Well, that depends. Do you think you could see inside of me, Mr. John? Ifan. Ifan. -What do you want? -I wanted to say sorry. I should have said something. I should have told you about Laura. I tried talking to her. I tried to make her stop to let you know-- I'm not interested! If I'd have said something then, maybe-- Stop! Just stop. Everybody lied. She lied, you lied. You're all liars, all of you! Laughing at me behind back! Ifan, that isn't true. Leave me alone! DS Owens? Sir? DS Owens, this is superintendent John Powell. He'll be taking over the Iwan Thomas investigation. Hi. I didn't bring a deputy with me, so I'd like you to work with me. You've been handling the case till now. -[Sian] Great. -The superintendent will understand if you don't feel able to continue with the case, if you feel there's a conflict of interest. No. I'm happy to go on. You know the investigation is gonna center on the man who's been your superior for some time. DCI Mathias. Yes, sir. You don't have a problem with that? No. None whatsoever, sir. Good. Let's see what you've got then. [Gareth] You! You killed him. He never killed himself. He never was gonna kill himself. -You killed him. -[officer] Hey, leave it. -Get off me! Get off me! Get off! -[Mathias] Let him go. -Get off me! -Let him go. Let him go. [Gareth] You killed him. Well, you drove him to it. His blood is on your hands! DCI Mathias... I've heard a lot about you. Yeah, I'm sure you have. I've asked DS Owens to work with me on this. I take it you haven't got a problem with that. No. She's a good officer. We'll sort this out. And then everyone can move on. -[Prosser] DI Rhys. -Sir. I understand you were at Newbridge when you first joined the force. When I first joined the force, sir, yes. [Prosser] Did you meet Superintendent John Powell? Did your paths cross? I was just a PC. Was that everything, sir? Yes, that'll be all. -Where are we with pathology? -Still waiting for their report, sir. -Sir. -Yes? -I'm not trying to-- -Sian... Just do your best. Mared. Why have you come here? They asked me to look after the case. I didn't have a choice. Is that a problem? I don't know yet. [switch sparks] [TV playing softly] -Hi. -Sorry. -[Manon] Everything OK? -Yeah, there's... There's no power. Fuse box. Only the thousandth time. Haven't had a chance to fix the wiring yet. -Whisky? -Yeah. Just put it on my bill. Oh, don't worry about it. Well, at least it'll help with the wiring. [Manon] It's my grandparents' place. I used to come here as a little girl. I loved it. The sea... Happy times. So you took it on. [Manon] Yeah, they were getting old. And my marriage came to an end. So why are you here? Well, I was sent here. Work. -Oh, punished? -Yeah. Yeah, something like that. A police officer came here today asking about you, about where you were last night. I thought you were the policeman. Well, sometimes it's not that easy. You know, you try and do something and... Well, it's complicated. What do they think you've done? They think I killed someone. I didn't. [Powell] How's Elin? She's fine. She must be thinking about colleges now. -Going to university. -John. If I had my time back, I... I never asked you for anything. I had a wife, a family. I remember. She's still my daughter. She's not your daughter. She was never your daughter. You made your choice. [locks door] [phone rings] Mathias. This is where I used to come to hide when I was younger. You caught me by surprise asking about Lewis. I put it away a long time ago, moved on. Well, I'm sorry to bring it up again, but... I appreciate it. How did you start modeling for him? I was a waitress on the front, just on the weekends. I was 17, still in school. Modeling made me feel very grown up. I'd sit for him, and he'd ask me to undress. Were you happy to do that? I don't know. -And he'd just asked you to sit for him? -No, she did. -Anna. -His wife? I didn't see it at the time, but it was her, really. She was the one that approached me, made me feel special. She said I was intriguing. She said I had a look. But she knew you were 17? Seventeen going on 30. It was Anna that decided how I'd sit. Like... like she was setting me up as bait for him. And you felt the need to press charges against him? They said there wasn't any real evidence. -Maybe they were right. -Maybe they were wrong. Oh, I decided to... put it all behind me and move on. Yeah. But things like that don't really go away, do they? -[Powell] You're early. -I know... sir. -Sit down then. -No, I'll stand, thanks. Fine. DCI Mathias... How do you feel about him? How do I feel about him? [Powell] Has he ever worried you? His judgement, choices he's made in cases? We do a difficult job. You know that. -Do you see him as a friend? -Yes. Does he see you as a friend? You'd have to ask him. You talk, though. -About problems. -What, like family? Why am I here? Just ask the question. You couldn't get hold of DCI Mathias two nights ago. Did he tell you where he was? -Mared, do you know? -Yes, I know. He was out looking for Iwan Thomas, but you already know that! Mared. Come on in. [hammering] [Mathias] You choose all the models for him? No, not all. But you decide who he paints and how he paints them? He felt guilty about it... -at the beginning. -Guilty? [Anna] Wanting them. He thought he'd hurt me. Isn't there a line between an artist and a model? I mean, shouldn't there be one? -A line? -Yeah. Professional line. You're a professional, haven't you ever crossed a line? They pick themselves. I can just spot them, that's all. Lewis doesn't have a type, if that's what you mean. What about Laura Dean? What about Laura Dean? -Was she different from the others? -No. Well, she used to stay here, didn't she, overnight? Like Joanna Miller? We have a spare room. You seem very comfortable with his indiscretions. [Anna] He's an obsessive. Obsessions come and go. And these young women... they're nothing more than that. They mean nothing to him once he's done with them. They fascinate him for a while. Once they step out of the light, they disappear. All of them? All of them. [vehicle approaches] Pathology is in, ma'am. -[phone rings] -Yeah? Laura Dean was pregnant. [Mathias] Do we know who the father is? Ifan? Sorry. I... I... I had to come in. I... It's easier to be at work. Yeah, well, it's better to keep busy, I suppose. You find the right soils, the right light, temperature and water, then what you do pays off. You get something that rewards you, gives back for the care you put in. Ifan, is there somewhere we can talk? We're on our own here. We can talk. Laura was pregnant. The pathology report confirmed it this morning. She was very early. Only eight weeks. No. We're sorry. I didn't know. Pathology were running tests to see if there were any unusual substances in Laura's blood, and they found a match with your DNA. What? Well, um... The baby was yours. No. No. It's a mistake. It can't be my baby. -You're wrong, it can't be. -Ifan... [Ifan] No. It's not mine. It can't be mine! -Ifan... -Get out! Leave! Get out! -Come on, Ifan. -No! -OK. -No! [yells] No! His record's immaculate. I'll make some calls, see what I can find out. Hmm? Can't you people just leave me alone? [Powell] We want a word. About DCI Mathias. [Powell] Iwan must have talked to you. Said something, about the things that were bothering him. Iwan drank. When he drank, he talked. Didn't always know what to believe. You made some serious allegations yesterday, Mr. Thomas. I was angry yesterday. And ashamed. Ashamed I didn't do more to help him. Got the better of me. I shouldn't have said anything. Look, if you know something or... suspect something, it's better to work with us. It's better to work on your own. Now I've got things to be getting on with. [Sian] Is that what Iwan was doing? Working on his own? Iwan had no idea what he was doing from one day to the next. [Powell] You could help us, for his sake. For his sake? When have you lot ever done anything for his sake? What did he mean it was a mistake? -Why was the baby a mistake? -He was devastated. That wasn't grief. That was rage. He was furious. Is that what you expect from someone who's just found out that the person that they lost, that they loved, was also having their child? We know Laura lied about the gallery opening on Wednesday night. -That night, she was Lewis John, right? -Right. We know that she went to work on Thursday -and left as normal that evening, right? -Correct. And we know that Ifan was in work on Friday. Yes. Checked with his employer, he was there all day. He left late, but he often does. Did they notice anything unusual in his behavior, his mood? Nothing they said. According to his colleagues, he was his usual self. -So no change. -No. He left early on Wednesday and called in sick on Thursday. He was ill? What was wrong with him? They didn't say. He just called in sick. Ifan told us that he didn't know that Laura was pregnant. -Maybe she didn't know herself. -She was eight weeks gone, Lloyd. Or he thought that the child wasn't his. -You said that he left work on Wednesday. -Yes, sir. -Why? -We don't know. He didn't tell anyone. Oh, my God, I think he's been lying to us. He left work early on Wednesday just to follow her, to find out where she was going. He knew about the affair. He didn't phone her in Caernarfon because she wasn't in Caernarfon. She was with Lewis John. He didn't show up for work on Thursday because he found out the truth. So the phone messages, the texts, meeting her at the station, telling us that she was missing, that was all an act? He knew she wasn't coming back. He knew because he killed her. What he didn't know until now is that the baby, her baby, was his. Get a unit over to Ifan Riley's house now. Yes, sir. Ifan Riley? No sign of him, sir. His car's not here. OK, Lloyd. [Mathias] I think I know where he might be. You took her from me. [Lewis] Who are you? [Ifan] You stole Laura from me. Ifan? You treated her like an object. That's not true. I cared about Laura. No. All you cared about... is this. I gave her everything. And then you came along, flattered her, made her feel special. Whatever you think happened here, you're wrong. You poisoned her against me. No. She died because of you. [gasps] [Mathias] Try phoning the house. Lewis? [Lewis groans] Lewis! Lewis. Oh, God. Oh, God. It's Ifan. [Anna] Oh, God. -What have you done? -Please, I need help, Ifan. Please! You and him, you're both the same. -[Anna] No, no, no! -[Lewis] Go, go ,go! You leave her alone! You leave her alone! -You leave her alone! -No, no! No! Help, help! Help, help, help! Help me! [Anna sobs] [Anna screams] [Anna] No! Ifan... put the knife down. Let them go, Ifan. This was her choice. Ifan, listen to me. This was all Laura's choice. -It's their fault. -No, it isn't. They've taken everything from me! I've known for months, deep down, that she'd been lying to me. In the end, I just had to know. [Mathias] Tell me, Ifan... what happened the next day when she came back? [Ifan] I just wanted her to tell me... why. She said she didn't love me anymore, that I was suffocating her. Drop the knife, Ifan. [Ifan] She said she was in love with someone else. She said it was his baby. And I believed her. I just snapped, strangled her. Why did she have to lie? Look at me, Ifan. Give me the knife. Come on. Slowly. Good. Good. [Anna cries] -Do you have everything? -Yeah. Yeah, I do. If there's anything you need, don't hesitate to ask. Thanks. Did you speak to the cousin, Gareth Thomas? Yeah, we did. Do you think he knows something? He knows more than he's telling us. Mummy. Mummy, come here. Look at me.
