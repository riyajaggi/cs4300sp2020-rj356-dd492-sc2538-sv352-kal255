 WOMAN: Hey. Hey, sweetie. Hey. Hurry up. [SIGHS] You think she'd mind us cutting out a few minutes early today? Dave-- Well, I've got a field call at noon. It is not easy finding an hour. Oh, come on. You know, hey, it's tough.

 I mean, I've gotta shift stuff, and it's just-- It's just hard. Am I gonna have to talk you into this every single time? Yep. So how'd you do? Good. The lock's on the door. Good. How'd you feel about your time alone? Uh... Good. It felt good. Katie? Did it bring any feelings up? [CLEARS THROAT]

 Um... Well, I dunno if it was the lock, but the, um... The night that we put it on, I fell asleep on the couch, and Dave let me sleep there. Why do you think that had something to do with the lock? You were tired. You fell asleep. That's all. Um, because when I woke up, the door was locked. No, it wasn't. The doorknob was stripped. I couldn't get it to catch. Anyway. I don't know. It felt very strange to be locked out of my own bedroom, so... No, honey, that's not what it was. Well... The-- The whole thing was silly. Why? Was it? All of it? [SIGHS] No, not-- No, not all of it. She's talking about our make out session. Oh-ho! Well, that's good! How was it? Tell me about it. Uh... Well, it was... Restrained and familiar all at the same time. Rusty. Mm. I'd ask him. I've never had to do that before, so... Well, sometimes it's nice to ask for a kiss. Now you know how it feels. How what feels? Oh, come on. You never had to ask me. I always wanted to kiss you. Always. No, honey. You act like you do, but you don't. That's not true. That is not true. I think it is. Well, you know, you can't even bear to be in the same bed as me anymore, Dave. No. What? That's not true. Yeah, it is. Yes, it is. You know, why don't you admit it, okay? Otherwise, really, what are we doing here, right? DAVE: Admit what? What? What do you want me to admit? You don't want to have sex with me. You want everything else but me! Oh, that's bullshit. Every free minute you have, you're with the kids. I mean, you nursed Isabella for two and a half years. Who nurses that long? You are blaming this on the kids? No. I'm-- I'm-- You stopped wanting me the minute that I had those kids. No, that is not true! Yes, it is. This has not been the last year. This has been going on for a time. Tell me about it. Sex has been hanging over my goddamn head for I don't know how long. Oh, my God. Every time I look at you, you have this look in your eyes like, "Are you gonna have sex with me?" Really? Yeah, really. Well, you know what? Don't worry about it anymore, because I will never look at you like that again. And you know what? I really don't even need to. He masturbates every free chance he gets. He goes in and locks the doors, so, you know... Why is it my goddamn fault? Why is it me? [WHISPERING] Nobody's saying it's your goddamn fault. Huh? Why? I mean, why can't you reach for me? Why-- Why can't you come to me? I have! I have! I have! Why can't you make the move? Why is it me? I have! I got us here. I got us here. No, you said it wasn't all me. You said. You told me it was you too. Why don't you talk about that? I don't really even know what you're talking about anymore, okay? I was sex. I need it. I miss it. I wanna be with you again. I never thought I'd be tired of hearing that. Oh, you know? That doesn't surprise me. No, it doesn't. Maybe you should forget about sex. Don't have it. Take away the burden, the expectation. The weight of it. Forever? Well, I've seen too many marriages fail when they shouldn't have, because they thought they weren't having enough sex, or the right kind of sex, or any sex. Sex should not ultimately be the measure of whether a marriage is failing or succeeding. In fact, it only is in our culture. In many others, the measure is joy and love, and family. All things you have in abundance. You love each other. And every move, every look. You love your life. You love your children. Sex is not worth the loss and destruction of that. We have hair fairies at 6. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Hey. Hey. Come on in. What's going on? Nothin' much. Um... So... I saw Anya last night. And I was with her, um, and thinking about you. I can't stop thinking about you. I can't stop thinking about you. Yeah? Yeah. I mean, 'cause... I'm supposed to be... Meeting her. Mmm. That is so fucked up. I know it is. That's what I said. Well, I dunno. Maybe we should, um... Go see her? Yeah. [HEAVY BREATHING] Unh. Ah-hun. Unh. Uh! Mmm. Uh! [BOTH GROANING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] So like I said on the phone, we're no longer trying, so... There's no reason for us to be here. Except that you asked us to come in to, uh... I guess, break up properly? The ending of any relationship should be treated with as much care as any other part. Of course, I believe you, uh, should continue with therapy. Really? Why? I mean, we-- Before all this, we were fine. We were happy, and... I think now that we have this behind us, we will be again. Yeah. Still, you suffered a big loss, and you need to acknowledge that. [SCOFFS] We have. I mean, believe me, we have. Good. Be kind to each other. Give it time. Time has a way of... Healing, uh, the most, uh, stubborn and intense feelings. We will. And, uh, wait until you find your way out of this and find your way back to each other. Great. We will. We're done? Yep. Oh, so, okay. Bye. Thanks. Thank you. You've been a big help. I wish you all the best. Bye. Thanks again. That was weird. Yeah. Completely. So, uh, what are you doing now? What do you mean, what am I doing now? I'm gonna go to work. Go to work? Free hour, let's use it. Let's-- Let's, uh, go get an ice cream or something. An ice cream? I dunno. Something. I gotta go to work. All right. But I love you. I love you too. Go to work! [SIGHS] MAN [OVER TV]: But I dunno if it's a good idea! If I don't lie! [MAN CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] You know, I really regret having started all of this. I mean, I never thought that we would say those things to each other. You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube, honey. No, you can't. Ahh! [LAUGHING] Can I have a soda? Yeah. You know, I warned you. I warned you about becoming one of those couples, and here we are. Oh, come on. Don't blame it on going to therapy. I mean, it was always there. Now it's just, you know, coming out. Well, it woulda been better if it hadn't. You okay, honey? You made me sound like some sex freak. All I wanted to do was masturbate? Well, what about what you said to me, huh? You couldn't bear the look in my eyes? I mean, I can't believe you said that, Dave. I'm gonna go to my room. Hey, honey, everything okay? Yeah. You know what, sweetie? Why don't you take Joshie with you? I don't wanna go. Oh, it's bedtime, buddy. Come on. No. Yep, Josh. Come on. We can play tic-tac-toe, okay? Thanks, bud. You know what, the reason that I breast-fed for two and a half years was so that I could protect our children. I mean, why do you think they haven't had ear infections, huh? What? You think it's easy getting up six, seven, eight times a night, huh? No, I'm sure it wasn't easy, What was wrong with giving the kid a bottle? Hey, hey, hey! Easy. [CHILD YELLING] Who's that? Who's this guy again? I don't know. Another friend. He loves houses, so I invited him to see ours. Should we? My question is what happened to the sitter? Well, I dunno. You ask them. Okay. [CHILD YELLING] Hey, hey, Dashell. Dashell. Hailey. HAILEY: He started it. It's all right. I don't-- I don't want to be too tough on them. I don't want them to think that I don't love them anymore because of the baby. Right. Hey, no! That is not allowed! Off the furniture. Dashell! Dashell. Dashell! MAN: Get down from there. Listen to your mother. So, um, ho-how are you guys doing? Any progress? Uh, yeah. DASHELL: Stop! Stop! That's great! Why don't I--? HAILEY: You started it! MOTHER: Hey, Dash, sweetie. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, come here. How you doing? I'm bored. Yeah? Well, me too. Do you have any movies? Yes. We have movies. Oh, no-- What do you want to see? HAILEY: Fairy Barbie. Lego Star Wars! No! That's all I want! You'll get used to it. Trust me. Yeah. So, um, who wants a cookie? Me! I do! Okay. FATHER: Hey, say thank you. HAILEY: Thank you! Hey, hey, no stairs! Hailey! No stairs. Down! Hey, listen-- Listen to your mother. MOTHER: Hailey. Come on. CAROLYN: Do we have any cookies? Jesus Christ. I know. They should not have more kids! Absolutely not. I think they peaked when they named them. After that it was all downhill. I think we dodged a bullet, hun. You think? Judging by tonight, yeah. Ugh. You think we would have been miserable if we'd had kids? I dunno, but... We're change, we wouldn't have this. I mean, look how exhausted we are, and they took the kids with 'em. Oh. I guess we never really thought it through. Mm. No, we did. We wanted kids, right? Yeah. 'Cause sometimes I felt like... I felt like I wanted them more than you did [SIGHS] What? I felt so bad for you, and everything we were going through. I-- I didn't really know what I wanted. You know? You felt bad for me? No, I mean, I-- I wanted them when-- When we were trying. But, uh... I-I-- Uh, I-- I like our life. I like, uh, what we have. You know? Unh. I-I don't want to be Nate and Julia. So you don't ever want kids. I didn't say that. Well, I wanna know. What? Why does--? Why does this matter now? We're not having kids. I wanna know. I don't think so. Uh-- [SIGHS] Well no wonder I didn't get pregnant. Oh, come on, hun. No, don't. Swee-- Where are you going? [SIGHS] [HEAVY BREATHING] Come on. Come on. [INDISTINCT MUTTERING] I'm coming, baby. I'm coming. [MOANING LOUDLY] [PANTING] Oh, my God. Mm. Oh. [BOTH MOANING] [GIGGLING] [PANTING] Stud. [LAUGHING] A tired stud. Ah. [SIGHS] There's this couple in therapy. Mm. And... [SIGHS] They're good people, you know? Struggling. They're good people. And I told them not to have sex, to forget about it. Why? Because... They want it, but they don't know how to get it. And I think, maybe, they don't want it sometimes, really. And it's too hard for them. They don't know how to get it. So I just told 'em to forget it for awhile. You could have told them what our therapist told us all those years ago. [CHUCKLES] They're not ready for that yet. They're too fragile. You were gone a long time. Yeah, I didn't wanna fight. I didn't wanna be here. So... Where were you? No. Just driving around. Nice. I want to, um... Put the house on the market. I hate it here. Walked around this whole time and realized how much I hate it here. Well, it's not exactly full of good memories. We've been here a year, and most of it was shitty, so... I agree. Um, I-- I meant what I said about not wanting kids. I know. Can you live with that? I dunno. We'll find out. Every morning, I erase the history on the computer and he doesn't even mention it. Like I don't have enough to do in the morning. Well, when does he look at it? Ugh, I dunno. Late a night. Have you seen it? Yes, it's disgusting. Big naturals, milf hunter, bang bus? [LAUGHING] Oh-ho, bang bus! Mm. What's a milf? "Mothers I'd Like to Fuck." Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yeah. So he watches and then what? I mean, does he go? No, I dunno. I dunno. I guess I'd rather have him at home in front of the computer than out screwing his secretary. There you go. I mean, is that the choice? I dunno. Therapist told Dave and I not to have sex. For how long? Ever. I mean, I think. What? No, I-I-I think that's what she said. That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. It is. I-- Don't have sex. Like that's the solution for not having sex. I mean, isn't that dumb? What did Dave say? [GROANS] We had a fight. A big one. I mean, you know, I-I know she's trying to do right. She's trying to take the pressure off, you know. But first she tells us to put a lock on the door so we have time alone-- How'd that go? --and then she tells us to stop having sex. I mean, does that make any sense to you. None. Yeah. Me either. Did you tell her that? No. Well... It's hard to tell her those things. She seems so...right. And when she talks and then I... Yeah. It just doesn't seem like that's the solution to the problem when that was the problem. Well, I dunno, Rita. I mean, you're not really being very helpful here. You should get a second opinion. Well, I am. Yours. Oh. Well, I don't think that's a good move. [LAUGHS] Well, obviously. What the hell do I know? [MUMBLING] Oh, why not? I'm not-- I'm not gonna tell you not to have sex, though. I can tell you that. I wonder if we're milfs. [LAUGHING] Hey! [BOTH LAUGHING] Hey. Nice haircut. I didn't get my hair cut. Oh. Well, it looks really nice. So I know the sandwich lady opened her big mouth and now everybody knows that I thought I was pregnant. But I'm not. And I'm not gonna be. Oh. I'm sorry. Well, anyway. I know I was on track to make partner, and I no longer am, and I think that's a mistake. Well, so do I. Good. Yeah, but it's not gonna be that easy. You haven't been focused for quite a while. So it's gonna take a while to rebuild. We'll talk again in a couple months. No! I need an answer. What do you want to hear from me? 'Cause I'm not coming back in a few months to have you say, "Wait some more." Or, "It's not happening. Maybe next month." You're not there yet. Kay. [WHISPERS] Fuckin' bitch. I heard that. WOMAN: Hello? Hey. Hi, how are you feeling? Fine. How's your stomach? Great. You're nauseous? No, you know what? I know you told everyone I was pregnant. So I'm wondering if you could start another whispering campaign just to let them all know that I'm not. Uh... Uh. Sure. Great. Thanks. You just-- You just needed to fuck the right guy. You know, it's like-- They're like... Antibiotics. Or antidepressants. [GIGGLING] There's different kinds of sex. It's not like I'm all better. Oh, pff. Just admit it. I like him. Oh, yeah? I'm into him. Yeah. You're a-- You like getting fucked by him. Jesus, Mason, you're like a fucking guy. Oh, come on. No, I'm not! This is what women are like now. You're just...stuck on some weird ancient version of what men and women are like. So when are you gonna see him next? Um, he invited me to some thing at his family's house. Mmm. Yeuch, that's not a good sign. Why not? 'Cause, you know, it's just not. He's already domesticating you. You're not a cat. Well, I'm not gonna go. Good. Because, I mean, he just broke up with his girlfriend and I just broke up with Hugo, and it'd be weird to go to his family's. Mm-hm... I mean, I don't even know him. [LAUGHING] But you're fucking him! I know! [BOTH LAUGHING] Oh. [LAUGHING QUIETLY] [QUIETLY] "This milf couldn't get enough cock." Oh! [CLEARS THROAT] Nervous? About what? Well, you're gonna meet my whole family. Oh. Family sucks. I actually like my family. Yeah, no. I like mine too if they weren't such assholes. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Jesus, you have more food here than I have at my restaurant. WOMAN: Hi, honey. Hey, Mom. Mom, this is Jamie. Hi. Hi. Nicky told me you'd be here. I'm so very happy to meet you. Maybe we could just talk for a minute-- Mom. Easy. WOMAN: Hey, Nicky. Nicky! [LAUGHING] Aunt Rose. Look who's here. Oh-ho-ho-ho! How come I never see you anymore? [LAUGHS] Hey, who's this? NICK: Jamie. Hi, I'm Rose. Hi, Rose. Hi. Honey, honey, can you help me with the cake? Happy birthday. Oh. Don't let Nicky tell you what to do. I love him, but you gotta keep him on a long leash. That's what I tell all his girlfriends. But you got a beautiful face. Ooh, I love you, dear. Thank you. Tell me your name again. [LOUDLY] Jamie. Jamie. I got it. Okay. What's trump again? You should know the answer by now, but keep trying! At least she's here. It's no wonder Nicky likes her, she can mix it up. Hey, will you take my hand? Excuse me. BOY: Whatever. What are you doing hanging out in the bathroom? I shouldn't have come. What'd you do? Did you piss off one of my aunts? I'm just... I should go. Is your ex coming back to haunt you again? No. It's yours. What? I shouldn't be here with you. You know, I'm not your girlfriend. I don't even know why I'm here. Yeah. Okay. [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] Let's just pick up a couple pizzas for dinner, all right? Fine. [MUSIC PLAYING OVER EARPHONES] What the hell is that? It's our daughter's jam. Jam? Come on, Dave. That's a word for music. DAVE: Well, how do you know that? There's a lot of things I know that you don't know I know. Well, me too. I just don't feel the need to let you know I know what you don't know. You wanna have sex tonight? Shh! Dave. Come on. Suddenly you joke about it? It's why you still love me, right? Well... I slept with Nick the other night because I didn't want him to go out with his ex-girlfriend. I used him, and her. And yourself. Who's Nick? This guy I met. The first time we had sex, or almost had sex, all I could do was think about Hugo. And so I told him. Well, actually, he asked. But I told him the truth. I mean, that was good, right? Very? Then...he came over and told me that Anya, his ex-girlfriend, wanted him back, so I slept with him. Just to make sure that he wanted me more than he wanted her. It's so fucked up. Well, maybe Nick said that to get back at you for thinking about Hugo when you were with him. Nah. I don't think so. It was me. You told me you haven't been alone in a long while. Ever. Why? What do you feel when you're alone? I feel... Useless. Mmm. That's not an easy thing to feel. I was at this park the other day with Nick, the guy who I just fucked over, and, uh, there was a bunch of kids playing, and there was, like, these dads coaching, and these wives watching, and everybody's happy. And I was like, "Oh, that's it. That's what I want." I think you're talking about intimacy. Not sex, not emotional games. Real, old-fashioned, uncomplicated intimacy. Yeah. Maybe. How do I get that? [LAUGHING] Did you wanna order something? MAY: Thank you. We're fine. I found an apartment. Good. Arthur called me. He told me. [CHUCKLES] I was surprised. Actually, um, Arthur wanted me to come. He wanted me to make a choice, again. [CHUCKLES] Brave guy. What if you make the wrong one? I had a marriage, too. A good one. But it wasn't a love affair. Most marriages aren't. They're much more than that. [MAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY OVER TV] Can you imagine never having sex again? I mean... I dunno, honey. I don't know how you can be married without having sex. Yeah. I don't either. MAN [OVER TV]: The third day in a row, oil prices and interest rates were responsible for a strong surge in volume and prices in both the stock and bond markets, here at home as well as abroad. [MAN CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] Do you wanna get high? Uh, sure. Right on. Mason gave me a joint. Really, why? Well, she always gives me these little gifts, just to remind me that I love her. Wow. [SIGHS] It's good, yeah? Mmm. [SIGHS] [COUGHS] Okay, that's enough! Come on! Don't take the whole thing. It's been a while! I'm fuckin'-- Well... Still, so what? [EXHALES DEEPLY] What? What? That stink! What? Jesus, it's just-- I can smell it. Me too. Me too. I can smell it too. Okay, relax, I just-- [LAUGHING] Okay, well, why didn't we see it? Oh, heh. It's right there. [LAUGHING] It's not even burning. Uh, can you not? Can we do that another day? Just come and lie here. [BOTH LAUGHING] Wow. Hi. Seriously. How. We just had this really intense connection. You know, and it was all tangled up in sex. Ugh, it was a mess. Thank God we didn't get married. Tell me more. And, um, I think when I fucking slept with you it was just to keep you away from Anya more than anything else. I know that's so fucked up. I only came over to get back at you. No, you didn't. Yeah. I did. Wait, were you lying? Did Anya not come over? She did. Were you going to see her? Uh... [SCOFFS] Oh! You're a dick. [CHUCKLES] I'm a dick? Oh. [SIGHS] Guess it's not that different from what we've been doing. Not doing. Yes, it is. It's different. I know. Psst. So are you saying we should try it? I dunno. I just dunno how to do anything to be closer to you again. So would I. I love you. [WHISPERS] I love you too. Here you go. Lovely house. Thanks. Really. Stunning. Thank you. "Pay-lek" or "Pal-ek"? Palek. He's not even that cute. I-- I don't know why I fantasize about him. It's just-- He's in my house building shit, and he's all sweaty, and all of a sudden I'm fucking him. Would you? Never! He's too-- I'd do a lot of things, but I would not fuck my sister's husband. Check it out. Right? Wow. Psh. I mean, if I lived in a place like this, it'd be, like, impossible for me not to be happy. I dunno. Hey. Hey. This is my brother-in-law, Palek. Hi. Hey. Jamie. So how's the house? Needs walls. Aha! Okay. I'm gonna go find my sister. All right. You, uh, check out the rest of the place. Oh. Sorry. The house looks great! Maybe I should buy it. Funny. Well, wh-- Why are you selling it? I hate the kitchen. And the neighbors. [SCOFFS] [FOOTSTEPS] Uh, what are you doing? Nothing. Sorry, I thought this was an open house. It is. Are you gonna buy it? Not in this life. Um, I know your sister. I'm Jamie. Oh, okay, yeah. I think Mason's mentioned you. Oh. She did? What'd she say? Uh... That you were gonna get married. To a guy with the same name as my favorite author. Hugo? Never mind. [MUSIC PLAYING IN BACKGROUND] You don't have a cigarette, do you? Mm. What does that mean? Heal. [ROCK SONG PLAYING] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
