 I'm suckin' on it. Oh, yeah, baby. Are you gonna come? Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. Totally-- I'm gonna fuckin' come. I'm gonna come in your mouth. I'm gonna come in your mouth. You're gonna come in my m-- Can you come in the cup a little bit as well? Oh, right. [GRUNTS] [GROANING] Good, thanks. No, no, I've got 26 gauge on the truck. Yeah, but you see, that's what's confusing me. Michelle's notes from the initial phone call clearly say 30 gauge. All right, here, let me look at her notes. Yeah, they do. But 26 is fine. Uh... ...can you just go ahead and sign it? Michelle scares me. I know, Jeff, but you gotta get over that. She's been working here 20 years. Hopefully, she won't be able to read it. Hey, how's Holly? She nervous about junior high? Man, I'll tell ya, never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined 12-year-old girls to be this terrifying. [GROANS] You goin' through that with Isabella? Not yet. You guys going to Rita's birthday thing? Oh, yeah, yeah. Are you? Yeah. Mmm. Our anniversary's the day after. Again? Every year, buddy. Wow. Which is it, 14, 15? Twelfth. Right. Wow... Yeah. Ha-ha... What are you gonna get her? Ah...something good. She deserves it. She does. So do you, man. Oh... Hope she takes care of you. Oh, she always does. [CHUCKLES] See ya. Yeah. PALEK: Whoa, man. TECHNICIAN: Very bad sperm. It's an epidemic. We're in the middle of a world-wide sperm crisis. Really? Yeah. And it's just the beginning. PALEK: Wow, well-- W-w-what's happening to it? Feminization. TECHNICIAN: Now, that is beautiful sperm. Beautiful motility, beautiful count... Nice job, man. Well, thanks. I don't know if I had a lot to do with it but... ...feels pretty good. All good. CAROLYN: Really? Beautiful motility, beautiful count. Apparently, I am not part of the world-wide sperm crisis. Wow, that's great. I could sell it, he said. Yeah, but please don't. I'm thrilled. Okay? I'm thrilled. Um, I gotta go. Palek? Yeah. Congratulations. Congratulations? Yeah, it's great. Yeah, I mean, it's great. It really is, it's just-- It's great. Uh-huh? I-I gotta go. Okay. Okay. Bye. [SCOFFS] It's funny, you know... Everyone has all these ideas about what we should do, you know... "Do we get a babysitter?" You know, "Which restaurant are we going to?" "What did I get him?" One dumb woman actually suggested that we spend the night in a hotel, you know, like that's... You didn't like that suggestion? Well, I think that's... ...pretty stupid, yeah. Do you have any water? I'm-- Uh-huh. Uh, I'll get it if you tell me where it is. No. I'll be happy to get it. That's okay. I'll get you a glass of water. Thank you. [POURING] You know, once on our anniversary my husband and I-- You're married? Yes. Forty-three years. Wow, that's a lot of anniversaries. Yeah, not all of them good. [CHUCKLES] My friend's birthday party is tomorrow and... [SIGHS] ...all I can think about is how to get through it without anyone mentioning it, you know. You really think anybody's gonna remember it's your anniversary? Oh, Rita will. I mean, our anniversary's the day after her birthday, so... I don't know, I just want it to be over. Because of what happened last year and what hasn't happened since. [LAUGHS] Yeah, I guess that makes it two anniversaries, doesn't it? Twelve years together is a wonderful accomplishment. Don't diminish it. I'm not. I'm not, I'm proud of every year. Good. And does Dave feel the same way as you do about your anniversary? I don't know. As I said, we avoid talking about it, I mean, you know, not our anniversary, but, uh-- But this. We avoid every mention, of everything as long as we possibly can. You know, there are ways to celebrate without having sex. Well, not on your anniversary. Oh, I don't think that's true. Sure it is. Sure it is. Go to any store, and tell any girl in any department that it's your anniversary, and see what she says. Katie. The fight against other people's expectations, against your own, is difficult but it is a worthy one. Forget about other people's suggestions. Forget about what you think you're supposed to do. And do what? I mean, the whole point of your anniversary is to relive your wedding night. Many couples don't have sex on their wedding night. Yeah, well, we did. So... [*] [KNOCKING] Hey. Hey. You realize you have no parking, right? This isn't bad. It's big. I hate it. Fucking landlord. Want my sister to call him? She's like a bitch at that shit. Does it suck? Uh... ...it all sucks. Ah, God. That's why since I was like 12 I've always made a point of leaving them before they leave me. Has he called you even? You know, that son of a bitch stole my favorite shirt? Yeah, well, I would be surprised if that's the only thing he took. You know, I never trusted him? You know what? Whatever he took, he can keep. I don't care. Maybe you should come live with me. If my house ever gets finished. I'm just so fucking mad. Maybe you need a dog. You know, take up some space around here. He's 27 years old. Acts like a baby. I need a shot. You wanna shot? This is, um... ...depressing shit. I miss him. Don't. Mmmm... ...it doesn't work that way. I miss him. I miss the shit out of him. You know, I can't fucking take it. Uh... You... ...need to have sex. Sex, with somebody else. Right away. That is the only way to handle this. It's like when you have a hangover; you wake up and you have a drink. It's like-- Like the same thing. [LAUGHING] What's this? Fucking Bogarting the shit. [ALL TALKING] DAVE: Happy birthday. Thanks. Same guy? Yes. That's fantastic. Come on in, Dan's getting drinks. MAN: Hey, guys. BOTH: Hey. [ALL TALKING] Hey, buddy. You wanna drink? Yeah, yeah, beer's good. One for her in a glass. Hello. Hello, sir. Lovely to see you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] DAVE: Hello, all. How are you? What are you guys talking about? Movies and how long it has been since we've been able to go to one. Oh, you gotta have date night. Katie makes us have date night. Well, I don't make us, we get out whenever we can-- What are these? WOMAN: I don't know, they're great. MAN: Yeah, but before that we were talking about, uh-- Tom and Michelle. Yeah, what about 'em? WOMAN: They're getting divorced. No, come on. Why? WOMAN: They can't stand each other. How-- How do you know? WOMAN 2: I'm friends with her sister. Dave's not gonna want that. I'll watch the kids. KATIE: No, it's fine. Oh, come on, how could you turn down a free night? 'Cause I wanna be with them. I mean, I don't get to go out with the kids that often, so... Ah, I think it's a mistake. No, it isn't. It is, Katie. [SCOFFS] Stop torturing her. Really. I'm not torturing her, jeez. You are. [CHUCKLES] You think this pudding is sugar-free? Mm. Do we? Yes, Katie. All pudding is sugar-free. Yeah, great. [CHUCKLES] I'm gonna go find Dave. Is she okay? Yeah, she's fine. She loves her husband, she loves her kids. She's not happy. Well, what should she do, bail? Like you? Oh-- I'm just saying, she's not happy. You don't know that. Well, I don't think your solution of maintenance sex every Saturday is what she wants. Oh, that's nice. Sorry. Sex with Dan every Saturday, completely works for me. It leaves me time for follow-up sex with myself. [LAUGHS] Where is my husband? [SIGHS] [DOOR OPENS] [SCOFFS] Hi. Hi. Everything okay? Mm-hm. I was just close by and I wanted to surprise you. How was your day? Good. Fast. How 'bout yours? Oh. Lots of couples in a lot of pain. Over what? Things we dealt with long time ago. Yeah. We can drive together, I'll leave my car here. Go home together? Sure. What? I called John this morning. What? Had a good talk. Why? I've known him as long as you have. Arthur, you had absolutely no right to do that. Oh, now, Mae, I think I did I... What'd you talk about? Just, you know, uh... Life without his wife, his daughter, the weather... But we both know it was really about you. You are giving this much more power than it deserves. Let's just leave it alone, you know. I don't need to see him. I want you to see him. No, I d-- I have no-- I want you to see him and then come home to me. Hey, Dylan, it's Jaime. Ah, I was wondering if you and Emma wanted to do something? Uh, give me a call. Bye. Okay, so call me, okay? Bye. Hey, Sasha, it's Jaime. You around? Uh... Give me a call. 'Kay? [CELL PHONE RINGS] Hello? MAN: Hey. Hi. You called. I did. Move on down to work? Yeah, looks like it. I'm sorry. Thanks. So how you been? Good. Seein' a girl. Jill. Oh, yeah, you like her? Uh... ...I don't know yet. Wanna... ...drink? Yeah. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] What about this? Does this look like Mommy? It's ugly. It is, isn't it? It's gonna be hard to outdo last year. We gave each other the patio. [SIGHS] DAVE: Go jump in a lake. ISABELLA: Go pick your nose. Ooh. Go... ...fly a kite. Go take a long walk on a short pier. Go row a boat. Go... Mom will love this. You think this looks like Mommy? It's purple. Yeah, yeah, but, um... Forget it. N-n-n-n-no. I-I like it, I-- I like it. Here, let's... Yeah, there we go. Okay. Hey, what's up? Nothing, just working. Hi, doll. Hey. How are you? You guys know each other, right? Yeah. Hey. Hey, how are you? How's it going? Mmm. Looks like you made it through your shift. That's a good sign, right? Mm-hm. Oh, and it's okay, I-- I told him. You did? Well, yeah, I don't know, he's my boyfriend, I tell him everything. [CLEARS THROAT] That's okay, right? Yeah, I guess. So have you talked to him or seen him or anything? Nope. That's good. You'll get over him faster if you don't. Yeah, that's what everyone keeps telling me. So when I break up with you I don't have to call you? No. You do. Wait, Jaime, where you going? Come on, I don't work 'till 6. Come on, just one drink. Come on... All right, can you guys just not be all over each other in front of me right now 'cause I'm just not into it? Sure. Okay. Thank you. You could totally be all over him if you want. Please do. Hey, I know it sucks. I don't mean to sound like a dick. Oh, it's all right. They were gonna get married. I know. I mean, I said, it sucks. It sucks. Like, weren't you scared? I'd have been scared. No, I was excited. Really? Yeah. Well, why? What's the difference? Married? Not married? What do you mean? There's a difference. It's a life together. Well, yeah, but, I'm not getting married 'till I'm 60. Yeah, I agree. And you know that most marriages end in divorce anyway. So, like, what's the point? MAN: Yeah, marriage is completely against our nature. People used to get married. Yeah, because they died at age 20. Monogamy is only supposed to last, like, 6 years. Tops. That's it's shelf-life. Really? Yeah. All right, fine, if I knew I was gonna die next year, yeah, fine, fuck it, I'd get married. How 'bout, shut up? Well, I believe in it. In the whole fucking thing. The little white house, with the picket fence and the dogs and the kids and the waking up and brushing your teeth and the washing the dishes and the making the dinner and the happily ever after. All of it. Why? What is wrong with you? You know what? You guys don't even know what you're talking about because I said the same shit before I met Hugo. Hm. So, what? You don't think we're in love enough or something? I don't know if you are. But I was. Mm. Should you be smoking in here? There's nobody here. Hey, Nate just called. They're doing sort of an impromptu game night thing I thought maybe-- Game night? I hate game night. Well, I'll cheat. I'll slip in some Meatloaf references. [CHUCKLES] You promise? I promise. Come on, let's go. It'll be fun. Also, it'll be fun, [CHUCKLES] and you know-- You know who's going? Me. [CHUCKLES] Well, could we win at least, 'cause we never win. So-- We always win. No, we never win. Whatever. I think we should go, I mean, we haven't been out in months. Come on. [SIGHS] Okay. Okay. But if that Saskia buzzes me, I'm gonna fuckin' punch you. Oh, okay. PALEK: Jersey! [ALL TALKING] [TIMER BUZZES] Ah! Giraffe! Giraffe? [ALL LAUGHING] Giraffe. Giraffe? Well, you kept giving me the same clue. You keep saying, uh, "long neck..." Right. Is there another clue other than "long neck?" What else does "long neck" mean? Long Neck, New Jersey, long neck beer, long-necked Gwyneth Paltrow. [ALL LAUGHING] "Gwyneth?" Yeah. [ALL LAUGHING] Oh, uh, maybe later. I'll take it. MAN: It's yours. Okay, who's next? We, uh-- I want another turn before we all get too drunk. It's actually us, you ready, honey? Yeah, I'm just gonna go to the bathroom first. Excuse me. Hey, has anybody noticed? I've lost 6 pounds for the reunion. MAN: Hey. PALEK: Nice. I'm, uh-- I'm not going. I am, I had a ball at the 10th. Oh, me too. I loved Pam Gellar's striped pantsuit. [ALL CHUCKLE] That's cruel. You're in a good mood tonight. I am. [GAGGING, COUGHING] Is Julia okay? [GAGGING CONTINUES] MAN 1: Oh, she's fine. Sh-she's good. MAN 2: Are you sure? Yeah, sh-she's fine. Um... We're, uh-- Pregnant again. [GASP] MAN: Shut up. You're pregnant? Yeah. Wow, again? Yeah, th-three. That's great. That's really, really great. Thank you. Is it a boy or a girl? Oh, I don't know, it's a little early but-- Whatever, I mean, a kid's a kid right? That's really, really great. Cool. Well, I'm glad you're happy. We are. Yeah, yeah. Hey, Carolyn, why don't you be on my team? Sure. [ALL TALKING] Got it? Yeah. Well, I can't say we're on number three or anything but, uh... Bu-but what? Are-- Are you...? Uh, we're-- We're trying. We're, uh-- We're officially trying, so... MAN: That rocks, that's great. [ALL TALKING] Sorry, we up? MAN: Yeah. JULIA: Okay, sorry. MAN: Yeah, yeah. Sorry, excuse me. Actually, we've been trying for almost a year. Right, Palek? He, uh-- Had his sperm tested yesterday and it is really, really good. Uh, we're not pregnant but his sperm is really, really good. Right? That's true. MAN: I have sperm envy. Here's to sperm. Yeah? [MAN GROANS] JULIA: D-did I miss something? ISABELLA: If you wanted fries, why'd you get vegetables? I didn't want just any fries, I wanted your fries. Is that pink? No, it looks good to me. Honey, does that look okay to you? Would you like another glass of merlot? DAVE: Um... You wanna share a glass? Sure. I can put it in two glasses if you want. That'd be great. Thank you. Yeah, okay. Here, okay, Josh. Sit up, sweetie. Here you go, buddy. Chicken first. Napkin. Good. Come on. You look very pretty tonight. JOSH: Hey, no secrets! Yeah, no secrets, none. Okay. Dad got you a present. And I am very excited. Sure did. We brought it with us. I know. I can't wait. Why don't you open it now? Well, no, we can just do it later. Yeah. Please? Okay. Oh, wow. Who wrapped it? Me. It's pretty. Mm-hm. It's such a noisy... Wow, ah-ha... [CLEARS THROAT] Wow, wow. Wow. Wow. There's more. Really? Okay. Uh... Oh. What is it? Pajamas, honey. Honey, out of-- Out of everything that we saw, Isabella liked that the most. Right? ISABELLA: Do you like it? I love it. I love it. Whatever, you can justify it any way you want but it was wrong. Look, I don't-- I just-- I don't wanna be that couple anymore. Okay? That weird couple that everybody's weird around. That's-- That's not who we are. And I don't wanna do it anymore. What? What? What don't you wanna do? Keeping this thing a secret. "This thing?" Now, having a baby is called "this thing?" Oh, fuck, forget it! You fucking-- You're drunk! No, I'm not. [GIGGLES] Ow. Shit. I'm a dick, I shouldn't have called you. I'm sorry. I just-- I'm so fucked up about him. [GRUNTS] Mmm, yeah, well, you know, not having sex is one thing but a kiss on the head is cold. I still love you. Right. I'm gonna go. Well, it's too bad I never got to meet him. Yeah, he's a great guy. You were gonna get married, huh? What happened? I don't know. You know? It ended the same way it started. Just kind of, all of a sudden. Anyway. Mmm. [DIALING] [RINGING] Jill, it's me. What's up? Hugo, you know, every hour that you don't call back just causes more damage. Enough already, fuck. Look, this sucks. Are you just sitting there listening to my messages? Or are you just ignoring my phone calls? Hey, where are you? [VOICES ON TV] You just had to take it that far didn't you? You started it. As if there wasn't enough pressure on us already. I'm just so fuckin' mad at you. Nothing's wrong with us, we're fine but that's not how you act. We're not fine. We're not pregnant, so we're not fine. Well-- But we will be. Well, we're not. And now everybody knows. Who cares? I do. We're going to get pregnant. Okay? Right. 'Cause now you're sure. I'm sorry? Nothing. What does that mean? Nothing. I'll get you pregnant. I will fuckin' get you pregnant. Ah, whatever. I don't even fuckin' care. Fuck this. Come on, don't fuckin' hide on the computer, come on. Palek, this doesn't help. [TYPING] [HUFFS] Come on. Can we go to bed? Can we just go to bed? No, I just-- Just leave me alone for a couple hours and I'll be fine-- What do you mean? Come on. Just put-- Come on, Palek. Don't do this. Come on, let's just go to bed, okay? Come on. No, I'm not-- Don't. Come on. Don't. What do mean "don't?" Come on, just-- What the fuck are you doing? Seriously, just fuckin' leave me alone. This is bullshit, come on. What are-- Come on. Come on. Come on, I love you. [SIGHS] You're fuckin' crazy. I'm fuckin' crazy? Yeah. [HEAVY BREATHING] [GROANS] [MOANS] [CRIES] [GRUNTS] [BOTH GRUNTING] [PANTING] Listen to me. [CRYING] [*] Coming through, come on. Move it. Thanks a lot. Yo. Hey, thanks for meeting me. What was I gonna do, right? Watch Terrence sleep? I just couldn't go into that fucking apartment we got. At least not sober. Yo, what's up? Can I get you guys a drink? We're good. Hi, my name's Chuck. You gonna sit there all night, dude? Or what? I'm out of here. Uh, look what you did. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. He hasn't called. He's-- He's not gonna call. And you're not gonna call him. You're not gonna call him. Not only am I gonna call him but I'm gonna call him again and I'm gonna keep on calling him. Wh-- Come on, where's your fucking pride? Damn, Jaime, what has happened to you? I was gonna get married. And instead, I'm in this shit-hole. Oh... You, you, you need some help. You know what? I have checked everywhere. I've checked IM, text, my messages, my phone, emails and it's like he's just completely disappeared and I'm so fucking mad that he-- Okay, I don't know how to handle this. Okay, I just-- If it was me, I would've slept with someone by now. But you're not gonna do that. I would've fucked Chuck or whatever, okay? To feel better than-- Than this, okay? Look, you need to see a shrink. My sister sees a shrink and she hates everybody. Right? Come on, let's... Let's get out of here. This place sucks balls. I was gonna get you something else but because of your promotion and because you still have a full head of hair, I-- I got you that. I'm scared. Open it. I'm not wearing this, right? Honey, I didn't know what to do. Isabella really wanted to get it for you. I wonder why she picked this. No clue. No clue and to tell you truth I didn't want to dig very deep on that one. Is there a receipt? It's there. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, TiVo. Oh, my G-- TiVo. Was it expensive? I love it. Mmm. Thank you. Honey, smell my hair. [SNIFFS] I think I have steak-hair, don't I? [CHUCKLES] Smells fine to me. [CHUCKLES] I think I'm gonna take a shower. Good. Good? Okay. [*] Over here. Over here. Yeah. This will make you forget about that fucker. No. Yeah. Yeah. No. Be nice, she's puttin' herself through grad school, man. [GASPS] Okay... [LAUGHING] MASON: Oh, shit. [CHUCKLES] Oh, my. [GIGGLES] Oh, mm-mm. I'm sorry. No, thank you. You are like a human fucking Valium. [FAUCET RUNNING] Ow, I'm sore. I'm sorry. How do those crazy drug-addict girls get pregnant? How come? Why them, not me? Don't, okay? Okay. Okay. [SNIFFS] We're gonna have an angry baby, now. Hmm? You know that. Angry sex, angry baby. Well, if that's true, than my parents must've fucked over the phone. [LAUGHS] Wait, what does that mean? I don't know. It's all disconnected. Well, one good thing is that we can't be worse parents than our parents. Just by the law of "you can't be less than the least." Oh, I think we'd be really good. You do. Yeah. Who do you think she'll be? Cute. No, I mean it. Well, if she's-- And I don't know why I said she, but, okay, um... Well, if she's the best of us she'll be unbelievable. If she's the worst then at least she'll know she won't be any worse than her parents. Hmm. You wanna watch a movie? Yeah. Can it make us cry? Mm-hm. [TV STATIC] What are we gonna do if we don't get pregnant? What? Well, I mean... What if we don't, I mean, what do we do? You just fucked the shit out of me, swearing the whole time you were gonna get me pregnant. And I will, but what if? What if what? What? Do you not want this? Hey, hey, calm down. I'm just asking. Shitty timing. Oh, God, I'm so sick of this. Everything I do-- It's wrong. [DEEP BREATHING] I'm in this too. Well, I don't know what we do. You tell me what we do if we don't get pregnant. 'Cause I don't think about it. Ever. You asleep? [SIGH, LAUGH] No. What are you thinking about? Us. Really? Nobody else? No. This is great. Come here. Look at what this thing does. If you take the-- Oh... I love you, honey. But what? What do you mean, but what? But what, Dave? [*] [*] Hey, you've reached Hugo. Please leave a message after the tone. Thank you. Are you there? Hugo. You there? I can't stop thinking about you and... You know, I miss you. And I need you. Call me. I love you. [HEAVY BREATHING] [GROANS] I'm so sorry. Fuck me. [*]
