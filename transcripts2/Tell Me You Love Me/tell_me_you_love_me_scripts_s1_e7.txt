 KATIE: All right, well, then I'll just call you later. Okay. All right, thanks. My mom says they're having a ball and they wanna spend the night. Huh. Isabella too? Wow. Yeah, wow. It's bigger. [CHUCKLES LIGHTLY] We could do anything we want, you know? We could swear or smoke,

 I mean if that was something that we did. You know, hey, you could do your thing in any room you want. You know, in complete privacy, so-- Very funny. [LAUGHS] We're free. Uh-huh. [SIGHING] Hey. You wanna get drunk and go to bed together? Wait a minute. May Foster said we couldn't do that. [BOTH CHUCKLE] You got your sense of humor back. [LAUGHS] Huh. I think I could get used to this.

 Yeah, me too. [EXHALES] What do you wanna do? I wanna memorize every word on the TiVo menu. I want to read in the bathtub and not run out of hot water. Nice. Enjoy. You too. [GRUNTS] [INDISTINCT SPEECH IN DISTANCE] Fuck. Hey. Oh, you scared the shit out of me. Sorry. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. I miss you. Uh... You can't just show up and drop that on me. I mean, that's not fucking fair. I can't stop thinking about you. But I thought you were detoxing from the drug. You know, I thought it felt right. It doesn't. It feels like shit. It feels wrong. You were done. I almost threw up in the fucking school parking lot, you were so done. I was wrong. What, did you have, like, a near-death experience or something? Yeah. It kinda felt like that. [SIGHS] [KEYS JINGLING, LOCK CLICKING] Look, I know it seems like it's out of nowhere, but it's not. I wanted to see you sooner, but I waited until I was sure. I've missed you. What? [CHUCKLES] What? I'm seeing somebody. [CRYING] Hey-- Oh, fuck. Hey. Hey, hey. [WHISPERS] Hey. [SNIFFLING] Hey. [KISSING] Hey. Hey. How are you? I'm fucking starving. I have the worst PMS. My tits are gonna explode. I'm gonna get my period any minute. Me too. No, you're not. Did you order? No, I've been waiting. Um, so it looks like we got an offer on the house. No way. Yeah. Already? Yeah, almost full price. Wow. Yeah. That's great. I think. Is it? I don't know. Yeah. And guess who wants to buy it. I don't know. Rich Guy Sean. Oh. I know. Really? He says he wants it, but he also says he has some things to go over, so... Anyways. Okay. Okay. Did you--? You wanna go forward, or...? I don't know. It's kinda out of nowhere. Oh. You know what I mean? Yeah. Well, we already made the decision, so... Well, you did. Yeah, y-you agreed. Yeah, I did. I did. I want a drink. Do you see the guy? Yeah, there's a guy somewhere. Here, you want a sip? Yeah, thanks. Honey, do you want me to, uh, Season's Pass DIY for you? 'Cause that means it automatically... What? I miss it too. I know you do. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GRUNTS] [MOANING, PANTING] All right, well... Okay. Yeah, yeah. We're totally excited too, bro. Okay. Okay, great. Talk to you soon. Um... Rich Guy Sean's got a couple issues. Yeah, like what? The house is perfect. Well... [SIGHS] ...he wants a short escrow. Oh, yeah? How short? Short. Well, how short? He wants to close in 20 days. He's going to Colorado for the winter. He, uh, likes to ski. Twenty days? That's not gonna happen. I know, that's what I told him. No, you didn't. You said, "We're really excited too, bro." I heard you. I know we can't move in 20 days, don't worry about it. [SIGHS] It is a good offer. I mean, uh, he has the money. Looking for a new buyer and waiting for escrow and all those other things, you know. It's not gonna be easy, and what--? What's it gonna buy us, a month? Two months? An extra 45 days in this house is gonna cost us 50 grand. That make sense to you? It doesn't make sense to me. I'm not moving in 20 days. It's not gonna happen. I don't know why everything's your decision. Everything's not my decision. Look, you've made some pretty big decisions yourself lately. Actually, to be honest, you probably made them a while ago, didn't you? We tried, it didn't work out. But if it did, I would have dealt with it. But it didn't, so let's deal with this. Okay? Let's-- Let's move on. Well, obviously it's easier for you to move on. 'Cause you were barely in it. You were done. You told me you were done. You know, I know a lot of brokers. I can find us a really nice place just for a few months until I find or I build us another house. Okay? I can't get out of this fucking place fast enough. Yeah, neither can I. How about a Jacuzzi? KATIE: Outside? It's heated. No, I think a fountain would be nicer. You know, we could-- We could put it far enough back so that you and Josh could still have room to play catch. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Mmm. [GRUNTING] Don't hurt your back, honey. Ooh. Gotta finish the patio first. [BEEPING] Hi. How you doing? I'm good. No, I-- I'm just, um... I miss you. Okay, then I'll stop by your place later? Okay. Bye. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Hello? I'm May Foster. Hi. Nice to me you. I'm-- I'm Olivia. You look a lot like your mother. And your father. So sorry about your mother. I-- I knew her in college. She was a wonderful woman. Yeah, she was. Um, my dad's not here. I was helping him unpack. He should be back in a couple minutes. He just ran out to get some supplies. Do you want anything? A glass of water? There's not much here. No, thank you. PALEK: They didn't tell me it was gonna be furnished. It just became available, it's not even listed. Yeah, I bet it goes really fast. Ugh, I think I hate what you do for a living. No, you don't. Yeah, I do. I mean, we move like once a year. How long are we gonna keep doing this? I don't know, how long are you gonna be a lawyer? Oh, great, now I'm gonna have wicker ass all day. You look just like you did the day we first met. [LAUGHS] Oh, John. You-- You were wearing, uh... a plaid skirt. You listen to me. This is very important. I never wore plaid. [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] You know, this is, um... It's a lot to face. A new apartment. It's tough starting everything new so quickly. I-- I don't think of it as starting new. More like... coming back. I've thought a lot about us since you called. About what we've held on to all these years. And? I think I owe a lot in my marriage to you. To the thought of you, the fantasy of us. This isn't a fantasy. I think it's about regrets. Living a life that is not filled with them. That's why I'm here. The thought of us together again was something that I used to get me through the difficult times with Arthur. With myself. And if you hadn't come back now, I think I'd still be using it. May. Don't talk yourself out of this. No. I care more for you now than those mornings when we couldn't bear to leave each other. Ironically, though, it's the thought of us that kept me with a man I love. That's a good thing. Then why are you here? Because I think endings need to be treated with as much care and gentleness as any other part of a relationship. Yeah, no, Mom, the movie was enough, really. Okay. All right, thanks. Okay. I-I'll-- I'll talk you later. Okay, bye. Ugh. They're gonna go to Target, we're gonna pick 'em up afterwards. [GROANS] Party's over. I know. I gotta take a shower. Yeah, actually, I need to take one too. W-- No, you go first, I'm-- I'm not done yet. [NAIL FILE SCRAPING] [GRUNTING] What? You look-- You look good, honey. So do you. [NAIL FILE SCRAPING] [SHOWER RUNNING] Three-four. Game winning double. Yeah? That's great. You wanna take a shower with me? Uh, no. I just took one. All right. Just be a sec. I'll wait. You hungry? Want anything to eat? Uh, maybe. [CLEARS THROAT] I have to tell you something. Okay. [SIGHS] Hugo came over last night. I didn't invite him, he just showed up. Did you sleep with him? Don't answer that. Of course you did. That's your thing, right? Sex? I guess you didn't keep seeing me in your head, huh? Look, I-I don't know what's going on. But you know, I missed you. That's why I called. That's why I'm here. Look, I've done the whole fucked-up relationship thing. I'm not gonna do it anymore. I'm not into it. I don't blame you. I-I get it. I don't wanna lose you. If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen now. It's not gonna happen later. I don't wanna be wrecked. I'm not into that. I'm not going back to him. Oh, Jesus. Could this go on any longer? They probably lock up the trophy so no one can leave. Aw, it's not that bad. Well, you're the coach. You get a plaque. That's right, Dan. That's why I do it. It's for the plaque. DAN: Really, why do you do it? It's such a time-eater. You know what? I kick in for the uniforms, I'm done. You're done. I'm the team administrator every year. KATIE: You know what I'm gonna do? Next year, I'll coach. We'll let them worry about the e-mailing, the phone calls and the snacks. Great. DAN: Yeah, yeah, I'm in. You know what, Rita? Why don't we go get some dessert, let these two male bond a little more? No, no, no, sit down, honey. We'll get you guys dessert. DAN: What? Come on, Danny. Dessert. DAN: I don't-- Yeah. All right. Come on. RITA: No. No, thank you. MALE MC: ...up here, just come in and stand on my left here... [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] There they go. The MILF hunter and the celibate coach. Rita. It's true. The five-pitch coach has a new wife. Did you guys know that? 'Cause if you didn't, I think you're slipping. We just heard it at the dessert table. Oh, please. We knew that at last week's game. His ex-wife is sleeping with the Cardinals' majors coach. I knew he wasn't having sex with his wife, because all he talked about was how much sex they were having. [LAUGHS] Hey, Dan, come with me. I have to talk to that mom I got in a fight with. I need some support. Now? Yes. We'll be right back. Okay. Oh, my God. Hm? [CHUCKLES] What are they trying to prove? KATIE: Maybe it's that they're still having sex? No, they are not having sex. KATIE: No way. You know how I know? Yeah, the hand on the small of the back. Mm-mm. It's the way she leans her head on his shoulder. Mm. You think any of these people are doing it? MALE MC: Everybody, trophy ceremonies will start in about five minutes. [CHUCKLES] Not many. Hmmm, I think you're right. CAROLYN: It's okay. Honey, this is a great place. Yeah, no, it is. It's just... You know, it's small. Come on. It feels like we're going backwards. Come on. Hm? Hm? I'm gonna go out with Nate and Sean. Sean wants to celebrate or something. Do you wanna go? With that kind of invitation? No. Thank you. All right. I'm gonna go check out the bathroom. 'Cause if the bathroom doesn't work then this is a no. I already checked it. [CLEARS THROAT] So how's Mason? She and Terrance still together? Yeah. The fact that they're together and we're not is a war crime. How's your mom? Annoying. How's yours? Brutal. Did we get any more wedding gifts? No. I think there was, like, a mass e-mail sent out. [SIGHS] I don't see why we have to do this. I don't know why we can't talk it out ourselves. I don't see why we have to do it here. Because we would fight and then we'd have sex. And I don't wanna do that. Well, I do. Look, I just wanna be able to have a normal conversation. To talk about everything. Okay. Okay. I want this relationship back. Jaime? Um... I don't know what I want. I know that I don't wanna make a mistake. HUGO: We love each other. If we start there, there's no way we're gonna go wrong. Yeah, we love each other, but we bring out the worst in each other. Don't do that. No. When? What do you mean? When we fight, all of it. I mean, all of my fucking paranoia, all of our shit. We have a relationship. I mean, we know each other. We-- We see each other. We understand each other. So we fight. Who cares? I mean, the-- The point is, we look at the world together in the same way. You know, at the same time, in the same place. I don't know too many people who do that. But we just turn the volume up. It's like our whole entire relationship is up here. You know, and I don't want it to be up there anymore. I don't think it's good for me. MAY: We ask a lot of love. All the things we don't like in ourselves, we expect that love somehow will change. Well, that's a pretty difficult task for something so fragile. I think our love can handle it. I-it's pretty amazing. You know, we were gonna get married for a reason. Yeah, I panicked, but I-- I realized it. And that's why I'm here. Hugo, I have to tell you something. When we were together, I cheated on you. What? When? When we were together. With who? It doesn't matter-- No, it fucking matters to me. I'm sorry. That's why you brought me here, isn't it? Fuck. You brought me here to end it? You're too much of a pussy to tell me yourself? Man, I-- I never knew. I-- I guess I never really knew you. You tortured me. You fucked with me. You... You really had me believing that it was me. You had me believing that I was so fucked up I didn't even see it. Fuck this. [DOOR SLAMS] [DOOR SLAMS IN DISTANCE] [SNIFFLES] [SIGHS] It's hard when someone you love that much walks out the door. [RUSTLING] Looks smaller. It just looks empty. [GIGGLING] [BOTH GRUNTING] [BOTH MOANING] Babe. Oh, babe. I love you. [DOOR CLOSES] MAY: How are you? Great. What's for dinner? Uh, veggies over brown rice with a hot curry sauce. Great. How was John? How was it? He's not the man I remember. Good. I love you. Yeah. Yes, I'm married. I'm married and bored out of my fucking mind. You ever go to dinner with 600 adults... [LAUGHS] What are you watching? ...talking about Diaper Genies and hair coloring. "You know, if you leave it in too long it stings. Shut the fuck up. A bunch of men talking about... He forgot minivans. ...routes to work. Yup. And decals. "Sometimes I take the highway, but if it's backed up..." Mom. Honey, what's wrong? I close my eyes but I don't go to sleep. Keep practicing, buddy. Sooner or later you'll score. KATIE: Josh, you know what? [PHONE RINGING] I spent half an hour in your room. You have to go to bed now, okay? I can't keep coming back there. A call at this hour. [PHONE BEEPS] Hello? Jeff? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, try-- Try to-- Try to calm down. Jeff, you got-- You gotta take it slow. Okay-- She what? Uh, all right, all right. Uh, sure, yeah. Let me-- Let me throw on some clothes and I'll-- I'll meet you there. What's wrong? I don't really know. Jeff was, I think... crying. Sandy left him. Who's Sandy? The girl he's been dating. Jesus, he wants me to meet him. Now? I know. I don't know why he called me. I mean, I barely know the guy. Well, you gonna go? Well, I think I should. He's really upset. All right, well, I'm gonna put Josh to bed. Okay. Bye. Be careful. I will. Come on, sweets. Goodnight, buddy. JOSH: Goodnight. Dude, the house is great. It's-- It's great. Yeah, I know. You guys seemed pretty happy in it. I, uh-- Just wondering why you sold it to me. I'm glad, but why? You're paying so much more than it's worth. How am I supposed to turn that down? [LAUGHS] Hilarious. No, it's just time for a change, you know? I don't know. Hm. NATE: Well, just tell him the truth. You guys are ready to have kids, and that house is no place for kids. I'm not having kids ever. [CLEARS THROAT] Well, that's why I go over to Nate's house. Keeps me right on track. It's a zoo. [LAUGHS] God, I miss that. You ever miss that? [PHONE DIALLING] CAROLYN: Hey. Hi. You found it. Yes. Well... what I am, like, the global nurse for fucked-up people? All I do is go around liquoring people up for depressing moments in their lives. I know. I just have the worst PMS. I had to get out of the house. You know, it's weird, it's like I never even lived there. I so don't wanna go back. Yeah, you know what? Fuck it, let's drink. Jesus, Palek's out drinking. Hell yeah. Look at that, I have a glass. Do I have any more? I just always assumed I would be pregnant the minute I decided I wanted to be. You know, after the first couple of months I was like, okay, no big deal. Then the sixth and the seventh month dragged by, and I was like, "Whoa." And then we started therapy. Actually it was Palek who wanted to start. Now I think that was 'cause he had his own issues to work out. At the time he said it was 'cause of me, but whatever. So, like, now, in the space of a week, we sold our house, we're not having kids, uh, we moved into this place, which I've been in like once, and honestly, I don't even know what's gonna happen next. The minute we stopped trying, everything went to shit. You were having sex, and she got up in the middle of it and left? She said I was disgusting. Oh, man. That, um-- Well, that's rough. That's... So that was it? That--? That--? That's all she said? Isn't that enough? Anyway, that's all I remember. Who could remember--? Who could remember anything after that? Yeah, yeah. I'm-- I'm sorry. That's... [SIGHS] So, um-- So how--? How long was it? Uh, three months, four? Is she right? What? Am I that disgusting? No. N-- No. No. I'm 44. I'm divorced. I had a kid. Shit. It's not that bad. Fuck you. [SIGHS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] Bed. [MOANS] Hey, hon. [SIGHS] I've been sleeping better lately. I'm glad, honey. I like it when you sleep. It makes me feel like everything's okay. I'm in love with you. Dave. I am. I don't know what the hell's happening with us, but I know that. Come here. [GRUNTS] [SIGHS] [WHISPERS] Dave. Yeah. Before, when we used to have sex... Yeah? I wouldn't always come. Really? Always? No. No, sometimes. Not always, but... Sometimes you would... Yeah, and sometimes I wouldn't, that's all. Just... Was it me? No. No. No. It wasn't you. Okay. [SIGHS] So... we'll fix it. Okay? [SIGHS] Maybe that Foster is on to something. Maybe. PALEK [OVER PHONE]: You've reached the answering machine of Carolyn and Palek Stenton. We're not in right now-- [PHONE DIALLING] [PHONE RINGING] CAROLYN: Hey. Hi, where are you? I'm at the new place with Mason. Really, I-- I didn't know you were doing that. No, I didn't either. Huh, well, when are you going home? I'm on my way. Okay, great. [CLICK] [PHONE BEEPS] [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER TV] [TV SHUTS OFF] Hey. Goodnight. [SIGHS] Babe, babe, I just wanna sleep. Oh, babe, I-- I'm just tired. Come on. Come on. We should go to sleep, baby. Seriously, I do. I just wanna sleep. I'm tired. I miss you. I'm having sex with you. Um, Palek, I'm tired. I know. No, but seriously, babe. I'm really tired. No. Excuse me. Oh, come on. I fucked you on demand for a year. Do you remember that? Whether I wanted to or not. Yeah, I remember that. Okay, well, then, so now I want it and you don't, but you're not willing to do what I did. Is that the--? Is that the deal now? I thought it was something we both wanted. I hadn't realized it was just me. I guess this is to much to ask, to wanna fuck your wife just to fuck her. Not to get her pregnant, but just to have sex. Oh, God, I don't want to. Okay. Jesus, you need it so badly, go jerk off. [CHATTERING] [BOTH SIGH] [EXHALES] I have to move again. When Anya moved out she got the landlord on her side, now he hates me. [CHUCKLES] It's ridiculous. I was in the other place before this one for eight months. And now I'm-- I'm moving again. Maybe you should stop moving in with your girlfriends. Well, I like being in a relationship. I mean, it's good to be with someone, you know? I like it. Me too. Of course, I'm too fucked up to be in one, but I'd like to be. I'm not going back to him. Why should I believe you? And how do I know he's not coming back? Because he's not. He's not. [SIGHS DEEPLY] Why does it feel like I should just walk away right now? And why does it feel like that's exactly what I should do? I don't know how to convince you. Let's get outta here. You got it. Hi. Hey. How are you? Good. How are your suits, do you like them? I love them. Oh, good. So, uh, what are you looking for? Anything I can do for you? Yeah, I'm just looking for something new. Okay. You know, I'm always wearing the same stuff over and over again. It's kinda... Okay, well, um... Jeans? Sweaters? Shirts? Socks? What should we start with? I don't know. You tell me. Sweaters. Sweaters. Great. Yeah. Lead the way. Okay. [TOILET FLUSHES] [BEEPING] Oh, don't give Josh pizza more than three days a week, okay? Well, honey, it's either that or chicken nuggets. All right, give him the pizza. Got it. Okay, so... were you...? I-i-if you weren't, uh... Were you faking it? Well... well, yeah, kind of. Wow. Okay. Sometimes or all the time or just...? Like, when? Well, I don't know, Dave. Um, I mean, you know... not all the time, no. You know? I didn't know. Well, I-- I got good at it. Yeah, you did. You know, you were right. What you said in therapy, you were. You were right. I mean, after we had kids, things changed. I... We weren't-- It's like we weren't ourselves. We were parents, which we had to be. And wanted to be, but the sex was-- Was just... I don't know. It's just... I guess I just didn't see you the same way. [SIGHS] Well, I didn't either, Dave. I-- I just-- I just let it go. And I shouldn't have. [*] We both let a lot go. Huh. What the fuck is that? Someone left a shirt here?
