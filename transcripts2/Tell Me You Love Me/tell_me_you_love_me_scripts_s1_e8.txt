 I just need you to find a way to be in this with me. What if I can't? You can. You can. [SIGHS] She's late. Yeah? Uh-huh. Two minutes, it's, umm, it's two after. [SIGHS] Wanna leave? What? We can't do that. Can we? I don't know. No. I just really don't feel like being here today, you know. I know that you never do, so I was thinking-- You wanna leave? Well, yeah. Kinda. I mean, is that-- [DOOR OPENS] Hello. Hi. Hi. When did you last have an orgasm? Are you writing this down, or? I don't have to. No, I-- So, when was the last time? Umm... Well, it's been a-a while. Were you with Dave, or were you alone? No, I-I was with Dave. [CLEARS THROAT] Do you remember the position you were in? Umm... I thought you said we shouldn't focus too much on the orgasm thing. No, you shouldn't. Whether or not you have an orgasm is much less important than that you're able to talk about it. Not for me. [CHUCKLES] Dave... It's time to talk openly about your sexuality, and I think you're both ready to do it. Unless... you think you're not. Now, it-- We're ready. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we're good. Good. What are the favorite things that you did sexually when you felt it was working? Uhh, I don't know-- I don't really... They were all fun. have a favorite one. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Oral? Missionary? Katie on top? Dave behind? Jesus, what am I supposed to say? All right, okay... Umm... I-- I like it... when... you know, uhh, Katie's... you know... on top. That's... actually my least favorite. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. [LAUGHS] Why did you have an orgasm? Was Dave stimulating you clitorally? Was he thrusting fast? Slow? [MUMBLING] I don't know, slow and fa-- Uhh, I'm-- Slow and fast, and just both. I guess, I don't-- These are the kinds of questions you need to be asking each other. It's difficult now because they've gone unanswered for so long. Yeah, but I don't really-- Don't see how-- I mean, I really don't-- I really don't see how they help, you know. I don't know, I've been thinking a lot lately, and I'm just, you know... Honestly, that we shouldn't... You know, maybe we don't have to come all the time. What? You mean, you want to quit? Well... no. I mean, I don't know... We're making progress, and it can be frightening. Yeah. No, I-I know. But... Dave, what do you think? [SIGHS] I never in a million years thought I'd be saying this, but I think quitting is a bad idea. Why is that? You know, it's like when you clean out your garage. You got all this crap on the floor before you put it back. You can't just leave it like that. [CHUCKLES] Katie, you disagree? No. I just don't, umm... I don't know, you know, I really-- I just-- [SIGHS] [SIGHS] I just feel a lot closer to Dave now, and I just-- I think that, you know, we've accomplished a lot, and I just think that maybe, you know... I wonder if we can't make more progress on our own, in a way. We're in the thick of it now. And if you didn't feel vulnerable and feel like running away right now, I wouldn't be doing my job. I think Dave is right. That it's precisely at moments like this when change starts to happen. I can't force you to come back. But I will urge you to stay. Hey. Hey. Hey. That's a big bag. Don't worry. It's just my softball stuff. Anything else I need, I'll borrow from you. Wanna go out? I thought you wanted to hang here. I do. No, I do. Hey, sweetie. Are you working? Well, I'm trying to, but I lost something, and now it's... it's a piece of paper, and it's just-- Ouch. Gone, and I'm going crazy trying to find it. This? You mean this one? Oh. Yes. That's it. Great. Thank you, sweetie. What is it, honey? You bored? Did you have any boyfriends before Daddy? Did I what? Uhh... Yeah. Yeah, I did. I... I did. Not a lot. But... yeah. I mean, you've heard me talk about Pete. He had freckles. Yeah. Who else? Well, let's see, there was-- [CLEARS THROAT] --Billy, he was my boyfriend in high school. Nothing serious, but... Oh. What's going on? Why are you asking me about boyfriends? I don't know. Do you like someone at school, or? No. Does somebody like you? No. Okay. Well, how was school today? It was fine. I'm gonna go to my room. Okay. Hey. You know, I remember being your age. Everything is changing... with your body, and what you're thinking, and what you're feeling. It can be kind of confusing. You must be more aware of boys now, huh? I mean, is that, is that why you were asking me just now about boyfriends? It's more... What? What is it, sweetie? It's not about boys... it's about me. Well, what about you? When I-- When I touch. Yourself? Oh, that-- That's okay. No, that's okay, Bella, it's good. You're just-- you know, you're-- You're getting to know your own body, th-that's good. But... But, what? Bella... I don't want you to think that this is not okay, because it is, all right? It's your body. Nobody else's, and you should, you know, you should just-- You just love it. When I do it, I feel a lot of things. Well, sure you do, you know, that's okay, 'cause everybody does. Is it normal? Of course, it is. Yeah, of course, it is. As long as it feels good. Does Carolyn know you're here? No. Why are you here? I'm worried about her. Why? I mean, I'm worried about us. She's pregnant. [SIGHS] I see. Yeah, and I-- I'm not sure I want it. You're not sure, or-- Uh, no, I don't-- I-I... I don't want it. I mean, we were done, you know, I mean, I-- Did you really think Carolyn was done? I don't know, I-I hoped, you know... What are you losing, Palek, if you have the baby? Well, let's see, umm... My wife... my life... um, oh, my sanity. That's-- When did you realize you didn't want to be a father? Well, after we quit trying, I, uh... I was relieved. I mean, I-I never had a-- A father... I mean, he was... out of there. He was never there, so... Never? No. Well, I mean, he... You know-- He didn't-- He didn't... want me. He left my mom because of me, because I was, because I was born. I mean, they never said that, no one ever said that. How old were you when he left? I was almost three, I guess. And you've been living with this ever since? Yeah, well... fuckin' life. Now I'm gonna be a father, and... I don't wanna be. I don't. I mean, I wanna-- I wanna... run away. Just like him. [WHISPERS] Fuck... It's all right, Palek. No, it's not. You know, it's not all right, 'cause I-- I-- I hate him. I-- I-I thought I was over hating him, you know, and now this, it's-- You're not your father. You came here. Your wife is pregnant, and you will be a father to your child. Yeah, yeah, I will. And the work we do here will help to determine the kind of father you're gonna be. But, you have to keep coming. And Carolyn must too. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. You need to just slow down. Okay. [BREATHES HEAVILY] Okay, okay. Okay, climb on top of me. Are you close? Are you? No, I want you to come. I want you to come. I want you to come too. I want you to come too. No, wait, don't stop, don't stop... What? This is weird. No. It's not. It's not, it's not. It is. Yeah, it is. What's going on? I don't know. Yeah... What, what's this? What's the big-- It's not a big deal, right? I don't know... Ah, fuck it, whatever... It's all fine. It's fine. The beef salad... the spicy be-- Yes. Uhh, brown. ( door unlocking ) And one Penang curry, shrimp. ( door closes ) And that's it. Right. Right. Okay, thanks. Hey. Hey. Whatcha doing? Uhh, watching TV, ordered dinner. Whatcha get? Thai. That's okay, right? Yeah. Is it too spicy, or-- No... I probably shouldn't have the peanuts, but... Allergies, they say it might upset. All right. I'll eat the peanuts. Okay. I wanna start telling people. Already? You-- It's not, uh, early? Well... it is, but... I still want to. You know, we've been waiting for a year, so-- Right. I wanna share it. Uhh, I went to see May. You did? I did. Why? Well, that's a tough question, sweetie. She thinks we need to come back in. Together. Well, maybe you should go. I mean, I don't... have the problem with this, you do. Remember how you felt when we couldn't get pregnant. That's how I feel now. Okay, we have a problem, and if we want that problem solved, you need to come in with me. I can't sit there alone again. Okay. Ok-- Okay, okay. I'm-- Can we just, can you just, can we just-- I-I... I just wanna be together with you, I do. I'm not-- I'm not really into it. I don't know, I'm... not-- Sorry. Okay. I want you, I really do. Yeah. Well, I don't... want you, right now. Well, when do you think you're gonna want me? I don't know. [CROWD CHATTERING] Oh, my God, I can't watch you do that. Look at you, you can't even binge properly. [LAUGHS] It's habit. Half my family either won't cut their food, or can't. I do not miss that. Do you miss any of it? I miss Tess, I never see her. Oh, well... she's 16. How's her boyfriend? What's his name, Chris? Sam. Chris was two boyfriends ago. God. You ever think that they're, you know... [EXASPERATED SIGH] Not yet. That's what she's telling me. I am so not ready for that. Well, get ready. You're like, two weeks away. I know. Believe me, I know. I mi when it was simple. Do you ever think about having... Uhh, no. [LAUGHS] Oh, no, don't even. What do you mean, you don't even know what I'm saying. Yes, I do. It's a phase, it will pass. No, it won't, you know... I'm not really even that sure that I wanted to, I mean... I really wanna have another baby. Katie... What? Have you talked to Dave? Well... not yet, no. You do realize you have to have sex to get pregnant. Yes, I do realize that. And are you? Well, not yet, but, you know, we're getting close, and-- What does that mean? What do you mean, "What does that mean?" It means we're getting close. You're like, close... I meant that-- You're like lying there, Okay, literally, in theory. about to have sex? Ssh.

She's nasty, man, and she loves it. I thought you were scared of her. Oh, I still am. But in a good way. I never would've thought of her-- Me neither, I mean, she's short, she's uptight, she's way too old for me. Isn't she our age? Yeah, but you know what I mean. Yeah. I totally get it now, man.

No. From Daddy, then? No, you have your own face. Your very own beautiful face. I'm not on Jason Grant's hotlist. Well-- Ok-okay, Jason Grant, he's a nerd and a dork. Okay, when you're in high school, and so beautiful, Jason Grant will have pimples all over his face. Dave, that's not appropriate. Well, it's true. Your daddy's right. No, he's not. Yes, I am. No, you're not. Honey, I-- Hey, you're beautiful. [DOOR SLAMS] Josh, eat your dinner, okay. Dave. What? Daddy? Who's Jason Grant? I don't know. [MUMBLES] I don't know... What's a hotlist? Umm, some people put hotties on a list. Hey. Dashell's turning seven on Saturday. Oh, good for him. Well, we're invited. Well, weren't we invited to one through six as well? Mm-hmm. Okay. But I wanna go. SpongeBob SquarePants. Mm-hmm. [TAP RUNNING] Am I doing this right? Could've asked me that an hour ago. Ha, ha, ha. [CHUCKLES] You always gotta keep the blade on the board. Why? I don't know, that's just the way you do it. Okay. Like this? Yeah. That's good enough for you? Yeah. Yes, we had shitty sex, but... Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I still can't stay away from you. They're gonna be here any second. Uh-huh. [DOORBELL BUZZES] Fuck. I'll get it. We could drive to that little bi-- Uhh, bistro place, on Center Street. Yeah, I've heard that's good. Umm, John's daughter works there. Yeah? Olivia. Well, in that case, I guess we'll try the Moroccan place. [BOTH CHUCKLE] She's quite lovely, Olivia. You ever wish that we'd has children? It's not too late. [LAUGHS] You haven't asked me that in probably 10 years. You think we would've been good parents? I don't know what we would've been like then, but I think we'd be very good parents now. The truth is, I didn't want to share you, not with anyone. Is that awful? Not to me, it isn't. [LAUGHS] Phew. God, this is good. Yeah? Really good. Yeah? 'Cause you haven't eaten a thing. I-I ate as much as I could before I needed to start drinking. Prioritize. Mm-hmm. It's not my Mom's, but-- What? It's not supposed to be. Oh, man... The things we do for love. I tell ya. What does that mean? Yeah... It's, you know. You're already cooking for your man. You just met him, you know. I don't know if my mother ever cooked for my father. And what do you do for love? [SIGHS] Wow... Not cook. TERRANCE: No shit. [ALL LAUGH] Fuck. What the fuck do you care, all you do is sit around and eat turkey jerky. That's because you don't cook. [CHUCKLES] Really? Just wondering, umm... have you moved your shit in yet? I was just wondering. No. No? Yeah... I made the mistake of telling Mason that, umm, we were having a sleepover. Right. Mmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah, 'cause, you know, first, it's like a couple days, then it's like a month. Then your shit gets mixed in with his shit, and you know, by the time you know it, you're breaking up and it's Hurricane Fucking Katrina. [LAUGHS] Shit... Mason is a romantic. In case you haven't noticed. Oh, I noticed. Oh, really? What the fuck do you care? All you do is sit around and get fuckin' high all the time. TERRANCE: True. [MASON LAUGHS] So? Maybe we should just get high. TERRANCE: Yes. That's a good idea. Matter-of-fact... A-ha... he comes prepared. Oh, yeah. Oh, nice. Nice. Love you. Ohh, me too. [TOILET FLUSHING] Did you check on Josh? Yeah. Isabella? Yeah, she's fine. [SIGHS] She's just, you know... growing up. Does that make us sad? No... Yeah, I don't know, I don't know. Jason Grant... I'd like to kill that kid. You know, I think that Isabella's starting to... Starting what? Starting to touch herself. Oh, Jesus, I don't need to hear that, honey. I know. I mean, really, God. How do you kno-- You didn't-- No, she told me. She wanted to talk about it, so I talked about it. Oh, Jesus, Jesus. It's strange, isn't it? Yeah, I mean, she was just born. [SIGHS] I mean, am I wrong, or-- I'm surrounded by masturbators. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] I am. At first you, now her. I mean, is Josh doing this? Katie... He's probably in there right now, Oh, God, he's six. going at it. Still... Well, probably shouldn't surprise us, right? [CHUCKLES] Next thing you know, she and that Jason Grant will be breaking curfew together. Dave? Yeah? I wanna have another baby. Really? Does it sound crazy? It is crazy, isn't it? I mean, I know that it's crazy. No, no, no. It's not crazy, I just-- I didn't know-- know that you were really thinking about it. Well, I mean, yeah, I mean don't you ever? I mean, we never said that we wouldn't-- Yeah, I think it'd be a great idea. I-I just-- It-it's a little bit about putting the chicken before the egg, isn't it? What is that? Is that a no? No, no, you know. It's just kind of, I think... I just-- I think we should talk to May first. You know. We should just talk to her... about it. Yeah, okay. All right? Yeah? Okay. Yep. Yeah. It was nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Can you call me? I will. Thanks, man. Thank you. No doubt. Bye. Good night. [MUMBLED ARGUING] Wow. Talkin' about toxic. Mmm... Hi.

Hey, you made it. This is quite a production. Oh, God, this is nothing. You shoulda seen it last year. [LAUGHS] I'm still paying for it. [LAUGHS] Can we help? What can we do? Umm, no, no, no. Just enjoy yourselves. No, no, no, come on. We're here, we'll help. Uhh... oh, go run and play in the jumper. But, Mom. You're okay, you're okay. Now I actually need to set the table. Sure. I want my balloon. Oh, it's okay. Umm... here. And, umm, you. You, mister, you can cut the cake, actually, here. I'm sorry? We need 25 pieces, plus five extra. And make sure you don't go through SpongeBob's head, 'cause that's Dashell's favorite part. And also, they need to be very tiny squares, and all need to be even, or else there'll be hell to pay. [LAUGHS] But seriously, there-- Yeah, yeah. Okay? Right there. All right. Go easy. Just over here? Yeah, yeah, right, yeah. Yo, hey. Be careful with that. Sorry. I got that. Umm... Sorry. You know what, why don't... Why don't you go supervise the jumper. Okay. How do I do that? Uhh, you know, just keep them from getting rowdy. Uhh, no shoes, no jumping into each other. Oh, okay. All right. No flips. Got it. Only a couple at a time. Okay. All right, basically, no concussions. Don't let 'em get killed. Right. You can do it. Umm... You know, I was thinking about you guys the other day. Oh yeah, how come? Well, I don't want to seem nosy or anything, but I'm just-- I was just wondering if you'd tried acupuncture. Oh, no. No. 'Cause, I know someone. She's really great. 'Cause actually, umm... I'm pregnant. What? Oh-- Oh, my God! Oh, my God. That's terrific. Thank you. Tatya. Come here, come here. Tell her.
