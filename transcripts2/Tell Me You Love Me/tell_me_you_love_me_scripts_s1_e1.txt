 Guys, come on, bring it in. Let's go. Bring it in. Yeah, Grizzlies. BOY: I'm batting first. All right. That's right, you're batting first kid. Hey. I love you. I love you. [GROANS] Hi. Hey. I'm gonna take a shower. I'm gonna sleep as long as possible. Okay. [WATER RUNNING] [QUIET BREATHING] Hi. Thank you. I can't wait to marry you. I can't wait to marry you. Um, my mom wants to know if we want a cake at the engagement party. Well, we already said no. Well, apparently that's the wrong answer. [WHINES] It's not just the cake I don't want. It's, like, the attention she wants from her cake that drives me crazy. All right, forget it. No, I-- It's fine. Let her bring the cake. No, forget it. No, honestly, I-- I don't care. Let her bring a lemon cake. I don't want you to go to work today. How are you feeling? Not PMS. My father emailed me again. Well, maybe it's time to answer him. Why? I don't want him in my life. You know that. Then why do you bring it up every time he contacts you? Call him. It might help. PALEK: Help what? I don't know. I should be pregnant and I'm not. What does that have to do with my father? CAROLYN: I don't know. Maybe the kid doesn't want to come until you clean it up. You think we're failing because of me? No. I don't really care why. I just want it to change. Fuck it. I'm taking the test. [URINATES] Oh, I forgot to tell you my sister called. She wanted to know if we wanted to grab lunch. Sure. Cool. I keep coming back to this one. ARTHUR: I like this. This one's a little-- I know what you mean. [GROANS] If I could decide what picture I wanted, maybe I could finish the book. Oh. I've got to get to work. ARTHUR: Don't go. Stay. This is why I didn't want you to retire. This is why I did want to retire. [GIGGLES] I'll see you later. Okay. Okay. What are we going to do today? I want to go to a movie. ISABELLA: So what? Bella. He always picks stupid movies. They're stupid. I don't want to go. They are not. You know they're not stupid, right? Yeah. KATIE: What's wrong? What? What the matter? I don't know. ISABELLA: I'm not cranky. Hey, guys. Hey. Hey, how was it? Good. How was yours? Stupid. Oh. DAVE: You still seeing Rita? KATIE: Uh, yeah but I-- I could cancel. No, no, no, go. Then why did you ask? Just checking. So why did they break up? They stopped having sex. And they hate each other. Which came first? I think they stopped having sex, then they hated each other. Do they hate each other because they stopped or they stopped because they hate each other? They stopped having sex and then found out they hated each other. Sex is a great thing to hide behind. That doesn't make any sense. It's easier to fuck than talk. Says who? Whatever. Every couple I know that stops having sex ends up hating each other. I don't hate Dave. Good. [*] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [INAUDIBLE SPEECH] [INAUDIBLE SPEECH] [INAUDIBLE SPEECH] MAN: I mean, one girl, one fuck for the rest of your life. It's scary. HUGO: Jaime's the only girl I want right now. I don't know, whatever happens I'll deal with it. Just because I'm getting married doesn't mean my life's gonna stop. Does Jaime know that? What are you guys talking about? Bullshitting. Sports, the usual. Starving. Me too. Come sit next to me. I miss you. What does that mean? What? You'll deal with it? Huh? Tell me. What does it mean? Were you sneaking up on me? No. Because that would suck. Well, that's not the point. It is to me. Tell me what you meant. [UNCOMFORTABLE LAUGH] Nothing. Fucking nothing. Yeah, you heard it. Do you think you're never gonna be attracted to anyone else for the rest of your life? What? Do you? Is that what your saying? Because if that's what your saying we have a huge problem. No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying. HUGO: Oh, come on. No, I'm pissed. Baby, let it go. No. No. Come on. Let's not talk about it. Why not? [BREATHING HEAVILY] [MOANS] [MOANING] [YAWNS] You want to talk? I need mom. Okay. What's wrong, honey? [WHISPERS] I have my period. What? I have my period. Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on. She's 10. I know. I mean, what am I supposed to do? Stick a tampon in her? Oh, honey. No, I'm serious, Dave. She's 10. It's just-- It's sickening. Well, she's almost 11. It's too young. Okay. We should check it out with her doctor. No, I'm not going to turn her period into a circus. Okay. Then what do you want to do? Nothing. PALEK: Sorry, I'm late. Oh, hey. Here. Oh, thanks. How's your day been? Uh, good... better now. [LAUGHS] [ELEVATOR BELL RINGS] Hi. DOCTOR: Hi. Hey. Palek would you close the door, please. [PALEK SIGHS] Oh, yeah... that. How did it go? I know this was an important month. It marks a year that you've been trying. Must be difficult to face. It's important not to look at this in terms of success or failure. And it's crucial that you face this together as a couple, like you'll face many other things-- I don't think that's the issue. Uh, you know we're not people who run from things. We're here, right? So-- Good. Let's talk about how you feel about not getting pregnant. Do you blame Palek? No. Palek do you agree? Totally. Yeah. Good. What's your sex like? Well, great. Always has been. Do you resent the, uh, pressure you must feel now... when you're having sex? No. No. Not at all. You need to fuck me right now. [BOTH LAUGH] I'm ovulating. I can feel it... and I want it. Hey, hey. I want it. Okay. Okay. Okay? What. All right. No, nothing. It's just-- I-- It's-- It's tough you know to just become this, uh...sperm machine. I-- No, I mean-- You know. It's-- I exist-- You know what honey, don't give me your feminine side right now I mean I love that about you, but not right now. Right now I just-- I just want you to fuck me. So-- No. I'm-- What? I can't. I'm too fucking removed. Don't do this. Palek come on, don't-- Don't do this. I-- I-I need you to be something else right now. Well, I need you to be someone else too. No, no. Nn-nn. So, your homework for this week is to forget about getting pregnant. For just this week, don't see it when you look at each other, when you touch each other. Let's just clear it out for now and see where we are. Okay? [SIGHS] Next time I'll give you a hug. [LAUGHS] Go. Let's go. Interesting, I'm starting to see who you are under pressure. And? Well, nothing. Thanks. Well, you know I just mean-- Why didn't you say that in there? Why didn't you talk about your father? Why didn't you just say that when we were walking out? Why bullshit in to it? Don't scream. I'm not. I'm not. Yeah, you are. You are. I got to go. Well, don't shut down. I'm not. [SIGHS] I'm not. All right. [WHISPERS] Hey. Hey. Hey, um-- Hey. [SIGHS] We need to talk. Mm-hm. JAIME: No. I'm serious. I want to know what you meant. [CHUCKLES] [CLEARS THROAT] Baby... do you really... honestly... Do you think I'm the only guy you're ever gonna want for the rest of your life? Ever? I mean we're talking 60 years. We're not talking about me. I just think we could start our marriage with being honest about shit. Well I don't think I want to start a marriage with someone who's telling me he's gonna cheat on me. That's not what I'm saying. No. Yes, it is. You're not saying it, but that's what you're saying. [LAUGHS] Yeah, this is fucked up. I-- Why didn't you tell me this before now? I mean, we've talked about everything. We've talked about our kids, our future, who we want to be what kind of pots and pans we want to buy but you don't tell me that you don't plan to be a monogamist. Fuck you! [SIGHS] Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I want you to know everything about me, who I am, what I believe, and love me for that. I-I want you to love me for who I am not for some bull shit ideal. I don't know how to deal with this. Well, I can't just abandon what I believe. Well-- And I can't just marry you! [SIGHS] You're not gonna marry me? You're not gonna marry me No! [PHONE RINGS] Hey. What are you doing? I'm trying to get people to pay me. What did the doctor say about Isabella? I'm not calling the doctor. We already talked about that. I know. All of sudden, I mean you were just pregnant with her. Do you think we did something wrong? I mean-- Do you think we gave her too much ice cream? All that dairy, dairy creates estrogen. Remember when she had the colic and we were giving her that soy formula? I bet that soy does the same thing. I don't remember that. I just remember the sleepless nights. Oh, yeah. Those were fun, feeding the baby, putting you back to bed. [LAUGHS] Hey. I never could have done what you did. I just want you to know I know that. Thank you. Why are you calling me? You just left. [SIGHS] I miss you. What happened? [LAUGHS] Nothing. When I get home tonight let's-- Let's have a drink or something, spend some time together. I love you too, Dave. [GIGGLES] Good. Good, good, good. Yeah, I got to get back to work. Okay. Bye. Hey. Hold on a second. How are you? I hate this. Yeah, so do I. Come over after work. No, I'm gonna go home. Come on. This is serious. This isn't pick up your fucking socks. You know, I don't-- I don't know. But coming over and having sex just isn't gonna do it. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Hey. KATIE: Hey. Fucking traffic, it's numbing. What do you drink? Uh, I'd love a beer. Beer. Okay. [SIGHS] Hey. I'm glad you missed me today. I did. Um, yeah. There you are. Thanks. Mm-hm. It's good. [SIGHS] What? What? Nothing. Nothing? No, nothing. How was your day? Pretty good. Yeah. Oh, he was a father from the day he was born. I mean, with our dog, with his friends, even with me in some ways, and I think that's okay to say. MAN: Sure. WOMAN: Yep. Oh, yeah, that is fine. You know, I think the world will be a better place when he can parent his own children. Well, uh, we're gonna start trying soon. When the new year is up. right? Yep. Well, you know, whenever. It's less about the child than it is about your own development as human beings. You know, I'm just gonna do this. Darling...tell us a little bit about Caroline's sister, Mason's new home. [SIGHS] Her first home, so-- There was that-- And it's spectacular. Except-- You know what. I'm sorry. I have to-- Hm, go give her a hand. All right. Okay. Excuse me. Sure. Sure. Certainly. No problem. Such a sweetheart he is. Isn't he adorable? I mean, I just complete-- I just completely love him. WOMAN: It too right. [LAUGHS] Fuck. What about your mother? PALEK: Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Is she still talking? Yeah. [GIGGLES] Should we do some homework? [LAUGHS] Now? Yeah. I don't care. Um... Oh, come on. Come on. Okay. Okay? Okay. [GIGGLES] [INDISTINCT SPEECH] Can't believe we're doing this. Shh. [WHISPERS] Stop talking. Okay. [BOTH MOANING] [MOANS] [MOANING] [BOTH GIGGLING] Shh. She totally heard us. Shh. Yes, she did. Nobody can hear us. She keeps yakking away. [LAUGHS] Okay? Okay. Okay. All right. Oh, my God. [GIGGLES] Here. Oh, thanks. Who is that dude she brought? I don't know. Um-- Maybe it's just someone she's fucking. Just kidding. I so didn't want to picture your mom fucking. Yeah. That's awful. You and me both. [GIGGLES] I cannot believe we just did that. Do I look like I was just fucked? We must. Yes. A little bit, right? All right. Okay, you first. Okay. All right. "And was also in such a hurry to get back to her work "that she quite forgot Colin until the last moment. 'Tell Colin I can't come and see him yet,' she said to Martha." "But Drake you tell Nick "that he got to get all the co-- People cleared out by noon." So they got to get out of here by noon. There it is. There is mommy. Go say goodnight to Bella. There's mommy. Goodnight, honey. Love you. [GIGGLES] Come here, sweetie. How are you? Good. Are you tired? No. No? Okay, well, let's read some more. Where were you? Right there. All right. "You tell nick that he's got to get all the corpse" What is this? "She opened the package wondering if he had sent a doll and also wondering what she should do with it if he had. There were several beautiful books, that just Colin had, and two of them were of gardens and-- [WHISPERING] A little writing case... with a gold monogram on it. [WHISPERS] Okay, sweetie, it's time for night-night. Here. [WHISPERS] Up. That's it. Wake up. There you go. [SIGHS] Night. Night. Hey. Oh. I miss you. Yeah, me too. Hey-- Hey-- I don't want the car. You can have it. What? What--? Wh-wh-wh-- What are you doing? What are you doing? I can't do this without you. I don't want to do this without you. Look-- I know, of course, over 60 years you're gonna be attracted to someone. Okay? That's no big fucking revelation. Okay? But you pussy out every time I ask you what you're gonna do about it, and it's starting to fuck me up. No, I don't. Then say it. Say you'll commit to me for life. Because I trust you and if you say it that's enough. Uh... Oh, fuck you. Hey, I love you. I love you-- That's not the issue that-- I love you. That's never been the issue! Wait. Wait! DAVID: You want a small one. KATIE: I need-- DAVID: That's not gonna work. Like a bigger one-- A big one. Fits there. Right there. Yeah. I'll dig. All right. Yeah, it does. Get another one for right here, like a-- Uh, a square one. All right. [CLEARS THROAT] Honey-- Yeah. Um... We don't-- [CHUCKLES] We don't do anything anymore. Huh? Well-- We-- I mean-- It's been almost a year. [LAUGHS] That's not true. Why don't we? Wh-- We do. No, we don't. We do in my version of things. KATIE: Well, what does that mean? It means-- I love you. I know. But that's not what I'm talking about. That's what matters. Listen, honey, let's just-- Leave it alone for a while. I'm not...going anywhere, and I don't think you are either. [CLEARS THROAT] [DAVID SIGHS] This isn't who I want to be. What isn't? You never h-- You never help me. Honey, I do help. All I do is help. Sometimes I get sick of helping. I just think that we need to talk about it... with someone. Oh, you're kidding. No. Oh. Oh, I don't-- Oh. You-- You really want to do that? Turn us into a couple with problems. That's a...slippery slope. Ha. Well, so is this. DAVID: I don't think so. Remember when I got up Saturday morning to take a shower? DAVID: Barely. Well, I saw you... masturbating. I mean-- I didn't mean to, you know? I-- I didn't know that you were waiting for me to leave. Well, honey, I wasn't-- Oh, honey, I wasn't waiting for you to leave. I just-- I did-- [SIGHS] I-- Honey, so what? I mean, who doesn't masturbate? So what? So what? I haven't seen that look in a really long time. And least not from me. You know? I mean, you're always saying you're too tired, but you're not too tired. I'm too tired for this. I-- [DAVID SIGHS] Hey...I love you. I love you. I-- [SIGHS] I love you, and too bad that's not enough. Oh, such bullshit. Thanks for getting in the car with me. What was I gonna do? Let you follow me like some perve. Don't be mad at me, please. I'm not mad. Yes, you are. No, I'm not mad. Mad isn't the right word. Well, what is? Sad. Why? Because I don't know you. Yes, you do. You do. It's me. [SIGHS] It's us... and one stupid, dumb comment doesn't stand a chance against who we are. It's not just a comment. It's a belief. No, it was a comment. I was pissed because you were pissed and I wouldn't let it go. Really? Yes. I will never fuck anybody else. Really? Yes. [BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY] [MOANING] [MOANING] [BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY] [GIGGLES] Oh, your uterine lining is beautiful. A 10, really. Your ovaries look good. I see a small follicle in your left ovary. What? It's nothing I'm just trying to break it up. I'm sure it will dissolve with your next period. Well, what if it doesn't? It will. It's just a left over follicle. All it means is you probably had two eggs this month. Are there a lot of twins in your family? No. DOCTOR: Anyway, you look really good. Uh, so wait. I-Is it my husband? DOCTOR: I don't know that. Have him stop by and make a deposit. We'll figure this out. Uh, if I wanted to get inseminated, how does that work? Your husband makes a deposit downstairs, we spin it, wash it, bring it up and inseminate. No, no, no, I mean with donor sperm. If his isn't good. Well, you choose the sperm, it's shipped to us frozen, we clean it, prepare it and inseminate. It's the same procedure. Thank you. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Hey. PALEK [OVER PHONE: Hey. Where are you? I, uh... I decided to get a massage. In the middle of the day? Yeah, well-- Ha. It felt like a good way to spend my lunch hour. And, uh, it was empty, which you know I love. Where are you? At your sister's. Well, how's it going? Good. Your father hasn't paid me yet. Oh, you know what pisses me off is he's gonna pay for this house, and then she's gonna get married and he gonna pay for that too. Should I call him? I call the accountant. Thanks. Love you. Me too. Bye. KATIE: Uh, I was 16. Very young. So, what going on? Um, well... I'm a little worried about-- About my marriage. Why? Because were not having sex. How long? A few months. Nothing? No activity? No. What's your husband's name? David. Where is he? He didn't come. Why? Um, he doesn't want to. He thinks that it will make everything worse. That, uh... Once we become this couple in therapy we can never go back to being who we were. He's right. Well-- Well-- That's good. Is that alright with you? I don't know. So why are you here? Well, actually I want you to help me get him here. [LAUGHS] If you can't, I don't think I can. Listen, let's forget about your husband for a moment. [CLEARS THROAT] Tell me what you want. I don't kno-- I just-- I just-- I want to be close to him again. Like, um, like we use to be. Sorry. Why? What do you miss? Um-- [CLEARS THROAT] Feeling like I'm in it with someone. Do you think having sex again will do that? Yeah, uh-- Yeah, I-I-I think it will. Are you willing to be here without him? Well, can I? [LAUGHS] You wouldn't be the first wife, nor husband for that matter, who's in couples therapy alone. Oh. I feel shitty. It'll be worse for him. We'll be talking about the marriage and you'll go home and he'll want to know what we've been talking about. And then he'll feel angry because you've been talking about him without his being here. He'll feel misrepresented. He'll feel outraged, that he doesn't have a voice. And then sooner or later he'll come here just to let me know how unfair it has been. And then we'll start the other part of the process. Okay. What have you been doing for sex? Um... Not much. How was the sex the last time you had it? Uh-- Uh, good. Yeah, I mean, we always had good sex. Are you masturbating? Um... Not really, no. I-- It's never been a real thing for me, so... You don't enjoy it? It's okay. Do you have orgasms? Yeah. Are you ever gonna watch live TV again? Not if I can help it. What's going on? This. I want to see it. [MOANS] [MOANING] I don't know why you won't tell me what happened. I did. No, you didn't. Nothing. I-I'm just gonna see her and see how it goes. Do you talk about me? A little. Not really. It's mostly about me. Why are you doing this? Why do you care so much? [SIGHS] If we have sex... will all this stop? Is that what it's all about? Your kidding. DAVID: No. Maybe this is all I needed to know how much it matters to you. Don't. Just don't. You want to lay this all on me, but it's you too. I never said it wasn't. [*] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
