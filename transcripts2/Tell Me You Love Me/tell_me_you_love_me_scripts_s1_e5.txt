 [HEAVY BREATHING] Are you asleep? Yeah. Can you not be asleep? Why? 'Cause I can't sleep. Okay. I don't know why, but I really feel like thanking you. Oh, no, you don't have to thank me. I'm perfectly happy to masturbate in a public place

 surrounded by nurses, it's... [LAUGHING] It's totally my thing. You know me. Thank you. I mean it. Maybe I should warm these puppies up. [LAUGHING] We can't warm the puppies up. We can't? No. That's the whole point. We can't. Okay. No, seriously. Okay. No, we seriously can't. Totally. I know.

 No, 'cause it'll jeopardize everything, so we just can't. Totally. I know. Babe, we can't. No. Okay. Okay. No. We have to stop. Yeah. Right. Okay, we do. Seriously. All right. Okay. You fuckin' woke me up. I know. I know. [SLAMS DRAWER] [LAUGHING] Did anybody see you? I hate when that happens. Oh, my God. I don't know. It was funny. So last week? Yeah. I felt a little... [KNOCK ON DOOR] ...um, l-lost. Excuse me. I'm very sorry. No, no, no. It's okay. Hello. DAVID: Hi. [CLEARS THROAT] Hey. Hey. What is it? What's wrong? Did something happen? What happened? Nothing. Nothing. Everything's fine. It's fine. It's just I, uh... I just decided to come. Why? [STAMMERS] [CHUCKLES] You know, we've done everything together and I just, um... I didn't want her to do this alone. Come in. [GIGGLES] I was just telling her I tripped coming in here today. You okay? Yeah, I just felt stupid. [CHUCKLES] [WHISPERING] Try not to scream at her this time. I didn't scream last time, did I? Did I yell? I'm glad you came back. Showing up, for whatever reason, is a very positive and difficult thing to do. [CLEARS THROAT] So let's talk about what nobody wants to talk about. After all, this is therapy. Let's do it. I know you haven't been sexual for a while, and I know it's been difficult for Katie. Has it been difficult for you? Yeah. For married couples, not having sex is not a new subject as you probably know. In fact, it's reached record numbers. And certainly there are obvious issues that we can discuss. One of the many things that couples cite as an obstacle is time. Or lack of time together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I'd like to make a suggestion. Well, that's what we're payin' you for, right? [CHUCKLES] Some practice before the game. Great, let's hear it. Put a lock on your bedroom door. Or, if you already have one, use it. Say to yourselves that this is a choice that you wanna make for yourselves, for your relationship. Put the lock on the door and spend a few minutes every day in the bedroom alone together. Look, no offense, but, uh, you've known us what, a couple hours, right? And that just isn't who we are. What? Lock the children out? This has nothing to do with your children. This is a choice that you're gonna make for your relationship. Look, you've devoted 11 years to your children, Give each other half an hour a day. DOCTOR: There's the follicle. Looks great. Beautiful size. This next part is just like a pap smear, okay? You all right? Yep. [GROANS] Okay. I'm gonna put the catheter in... through your cervix... into your uterus. You doin' all right? Fine. [QUIETLY] Okay. This looks really good. Very good. Mm. Well. Well, I've been told. [LAUGHS] Okay. Here we go. Okay, it's goin' in. This'll just take a minute or so, okay? Okay. Doin' all right? Great. So out of all these millions and millions and millions of sperm, uh, at least one should score, don't you think? That's the idea, yeah. Okay. That's it. Great. You did very well. Like, uh, but how well? What do you think our chances are? They're good. CAROLYN: Like, how good? More than 50 percent? Um, ahem, well, that's hard to say. But everything looked really good. I did notice that your uterus was slightly tilted but that doesn't mean anything, that's just how you're built. You may wanna get on all fours for the next 10 minutes. Most doctors say it doesn't matter but it can't hurt. Sure. Yeah. Like, just like this? Like, right here? Honey, could you help? Yeah, um, sorry. There we go. Like this? You got it. Okay. Good luck, you guys. Thank you. Thank you. Did it feel weird? Uh, yeah. Yeah? Really, how? I don't know, just, like, demystified. I'm glad we did it. Me too. I love you. I love you too. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Yeah, it is. But what do you think? I don't know. To me, it's a stretch. Yeah, I know. I gotta go, honey. Okay. NICK: Do you have it or not? WOMAN: No. I told you I didn't. Then where is it? What do you think that I am? Some kind of stalker? I'm not gonna break in, for fuck sake. But why is it so important to you to have your fucking key? Because it's the key to my apartment and I want it back. This is such bullshit. I have to work, okay? [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] [WHISPERING] Whoa, look, a Lamborghini. Cool. What color is it? KID: Yellow. DAD: Yellow. [CELL PHONE RINGING] [KID CRYING] Hold on. DAD: Quiet. Hold on. KID: Mommy. Shoot. Hold on. Hey, babe. Hi. No, I-- I didn't pick it up. You need it today? Because-- I didn't pay. Hold on, he's-- Do we have to ride with your--? Do we have to ride with your sister and her kids? Ho-- Hold on, he's-- I'll call you back. Hold on, Garret. Mommy's at home. Mommy's at home. Come on, let's go. [KID CRYING] KID: Mommy. Hey. Hey. Sorry I'm late. It's okay. I didn't wanna deal with that place on Saturday. Four hours to stand in line and buy a can opener. Here. Okay. Oh, you got it, the lock. Yeah. Yeah. [SIGHS] I don't have to put it on, I can take it back. You know, we'll keep it and... Uh, I... Great, I-- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm quitting sex. Can I get an order of French fries? I'm quitting. I'm serious. I'm sober. Today is my first official day of being sober. Yuck. Why? You love sex. No, I don't. See, I need it and it's fucking ruining my life. Well, I don't know why you're blaming sex. 'Cause it ruins everything. Look, good sex just hides everything that's bad about a relationship. Well, then have bad sex. Okay, have good sex. Fuck I don't know. Have you--? Have you run this by your shrink? She'd agree with me. Fuck, maybe then I should do it. Like, have a cleanse. Like, a sex cleanse. What was she like? Was she--? Was she firm? Mm. Kinda. Little bit intimidating, but nice. Huh, I wanna full description. I just wanna imagine my sister sitting there, just submissive. How fucked up am I? I think you should go see her. I'd like to but she wouldn't have me. I kinda like all these old school sports guys, you know that I mean? The way they look at sports, it's like-- Look at 'em, it's a totally different way than they look at us. It's, like, a totally different kind of love. How we doin' over here? Yeah. They're lucky. I don't know why you're so intent on being a couple. Like, what's so great about it? It's like all you care about is being stuck in some long-term thing. I mean, why? What do you mean, why? Because I wanna be with someone. I wanna spend my life with someone, all right. That's what I want. Okay. You're as retro as these guys. Marry one of them. [LAUGHS] Hey, I'm gonna have a shower. [WHISPERS] Okay. [GROANS] [WHISPERS] Hey. I love you. I love you too. Hey. Hi. Oh, she's not in here. I know. That's why I am. Came to get your key? It's not about the key. Yeah, I didn't think so. I'm just here getting some stuff she left for me Because if we see each other, we're just gonna...fight. Yeah. No, I know. I just went through that. It's not fun, man. No, it isn't. Hey, you wanna get a drink? I thought you were 'toxing. I am. I was. I don't think so. I'm doin' you a favor. [LAUGHS] All right. All right. Hey. Tonight? Yeah. Come on, I'm pulling harder than you are. Oh, yeah, well, I'm just saving up for when we move it back in a minute. [BOTH LAUGHING] All right. The bed stays right here. There's no law that says it has to be against the wall. We can just pretend we're on an island somewhere. So how was lunch? [SIGHS] I cancelled. Why? Didn't wanna go. Why not? Why are you pushing me to do this? Because I want it to be over. It is over. You said that before. And I meant it. The first time, when you came back from being with him, you told me it would never happen again, but it did. Once more. It happened once more. Arthur, I married you, not him. It'll never happen again. I've heard that before. [SIGHS] [MAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY OVER TV] Honey. Honey. Mm. You fell asleep. Just for a couple more minutes. [TV CLICKS OFF] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] [GRUNTING] You know, the owner of this place died in his stool. [CHUCKLES] No. He didn't. Yeah, he did. Ask the bartender. [LAUGHS] Yeah, I think I'll pass. I'm gonna go put music in the jukebox, all right? It's about 10 songs in front of us. Are they good ones? I don't know. Well, what'd you pick? If you stick around, you'll find out. All right. [CLEARS THROAT] [GIGGLES] [SHAKING DOORKNOB] [KNOCKS] Dave. Dave. Yep. What did you do? Lock the door? No, no, no. It's just, it's not-- It's not level. What? It wasn't level.

What do you want me to do now, wake you up? It just bothers me, I mean, you left me out there, lying out there, I mean... Well, you fell asleep. Yeah, but that was-- That was our 20 minutes, Dave, and you took it for yourself, I mean-- Well, yeah, and-- And you slept through it. [SIGHS] Okay, well, you know what? Then just take the lock off, I mean, why do we even have it, then, you know? Well, because some crazy woman with no kids told us to. Kiss me. [BOTH GRUNTING LIGHTLY] [SIGHS] Why is this so hard? I don't know. It never used to be. No. It wasn't. [SIGHS] Well, don't let me stop ya. Shut up. Come here. They're different. Well, they're amazing. No, they're different. Oh.

Sweetie, uh, watch your glass, it's gonna fall over. Dad, tell him to stop. DAVID: Josh, stop. KATIE: Stop what? ISABELLA: He's looking at me. KATIE: Isabella, he is not looking at you. Yes, he is. You're not looking at him. All right. Both of you, stop looking. Just eat. Are you eating that waffle? Yes, I'm eating it, what do you think? Hey! JOSH: You can't have it. Hey! Hey! Both of you.

Well, finally, you move back home. Mm-hm. I've been waiting. Funny, Mom. Mm-hm. So how's Carolyn? She's good. Where is she? She's running errands and usual. Good. So we've got a little bit of time together. Now, I wanna show you what I've done with your room. Ahem, I've turned it back into the garage. Huh. Why? Well, I'm getting ready to sell it, darling. The house? Yeah. I don't wanna live here anymore. Wow. When were you gonna tell me. Soon. I mean, I'm not doing it tomorrow. And I didn't really think that you'd care very much. I mean, you're not here very much anymore. Well, I don't care. I'm just surprised. Why wouldn't you tell me? I could have helped. This is kinda what I do, Mom. Well, I know Caroline doesn't like it when you spend much time with me. Uh, that's not true, Mom. And you are working on her sister's house. Mom... Okay, it-- Did you tell Dad? Why would I tell your father? He built the house. He might want it. Well, then he should have stayed in it. [SIGHS] He called me again. Should I call him back, or...? Well, it's your life, darling, but he's never been much of a father to you. Except when it's been convenient to him, and he was certainly not much of a husband to me. You know, the first time he called and, uh, Carolyn heard the message, she thought it was me. You're nothing like your father. Never will be. I know. I know. Since I haven't seen him in over three years. Do you miss him? No. No. That says a lot about the kind of father he was. Yeah, I guess it does. But he did come to four of my baseball games. And, oh, yeah, he came to that art class once. Oh, did he? Yeah. Do we even want coffee? [CHUCKLES] Doesn't matter. Whatever you want. Nah. Wow. You were gonna get married. You really were gonna do it. Yeah. No, we were getting presents and had all the plans made. Less than three months away. You seem to be doing okay. Yeah, I'm not. How long were you together? A year. What about you guys? Eight months. Hm. Pick something. That's a lot of pressure. Ooh, why do you think I gave it to you? All right. Fine. So, what happened with you and Anya? I don't know. A-- Psht. I don't know. When we moved in together we were happy and then... [SIGHS] Then we got to know each other. Hm. Do you miss it? Being with her? If I let myself. Well, that's honest. It's a good one. I should go. I have to get up early in the morning. Softball. You play softball? Yeah. Memorial Park every Saturday. About 10 a.m. It depends on how wasted the guys get the night before. Ten a.m. Heck. Yeah. I used to play. Really? I was, like, a total jock until high school. And then what happened? Mm, I don't know. I started having sex. I didn't know that it was one or the other. Yeah, it was for me. Why? I don't know. Sex is a lot more fun than sports. Sometimes. Give me that. Give me that. No. There's a song I wanna hear. All right. [CLEARS THROAT] Play it. What? Uh, you know what, I-- The song I was thinking about isn't in this iPod. Yeah. Sure. Cool. See you around. [WHISPERS] I wanna fuck. Mm. I don't have a condom. I do. Are you not into this? [CHUCKLES] That's all right. [CHUCKLES] It's okay. [GRUNTS LIGHTLY] [SIGHS] Go, go, go, go, go! Go, keep going! [CHEERING, LAUGHING] Only one out. Good one. Hey, Josh. That's good. Yeah. Way to send 'em in, huh? Good job. Good job. Good job, buddy. Good job. Uh, let's-- Let's, uh-- You know, the sugar, caffeine... Water? Do you have water? DAVID: Good job. Come on, Justin.

Got an extra glove? Hey. How do you come play ball without a glove? I figure you had an extra one. Do we have an extra glove in there? MAN: Yeah. Check my bag. [GROANS] Dad would listen to you. You guys have a different kind of relationship. Well, that's 'cause he's not doing anything for me. Well, I didn't ask him to. [CELL PHONE RINGS] He offered. No, you let him. That's the difference. Why wouldn't I? Well, 'cause that way you don't owe him any-- Whatever. Honey, can we go get something to eat? I'm starving. I'm hungry, like, every hour. Okay. In a minute. You okay? Yep. I'm tired. And I feel a little off. It's a terrible installation. It's fuckin' terrible. Dude, that's why you need to be here. He loves you more. That's why he hates you. Babe, I'm not calling him. You call him. Besides, you don't just call Dad. You have to, like, weapon up and prepare and be all, like, ready. I'm not doing that. You get him. That's why you do better with him. Palek, will you tell her to call him? No. [BANGING] [DIALING CELL PHONE] Hey, it's Palek, listen... I haven't returned your calls for a reason. I thought I made it clear two years ago, I really didn't have any interest in any kind of relationship. Well, nothing's happened to change that, so... Next time you feel an urge to talk to me, deal with it, because I did. [BEEPS] I need a shower. Yeah, me too. Call you in an hour? Oh, you're gonna go home? Yeah. I'm starving. Okay. Yeah. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello. Hi. Hey. What are you doing? What? I mean, what's happening here? I should ask you, you're the one that showed up. Well, I wanted to see you. I felt bad. It's not a big deal. It's cool. You weren't into it. I was into it. Let's hook up later. Uh...no. No, I don't think so. Uh... [SIGHS] Fuck. You know why? You're not over your ex. I don't think I'm over mine either. [PHONE BEEPS] DAVID: Good. Oh. Okay, honey, I'm gonna take this guy and go. Like that? Yeah. He looks fine. You ready? Mm. Okay. Let's go. Hey. Yeah? Hurry back. I will. JOSH: Piggy. DAVID: Piggy back outside. JOSH: Piggy back. Do you wanna draw? Yeah. All right, let's go draw. Come on. You have your pencils? I'll get some. [TOILET FLUSHES] Hey, could you go get me some more tests? More tests? Yeah. Honey... Just-- Just go. Hey. Hi. Cool. [SIGHS] I don't know this one. [*] "With new fury, the battle continued "as the dogs chased the cats to the deck. "'Leave us alone, you shan't have one bone.' "The dogs trapped the cats in a net. "'Bones,' screamed the cats, 'Are they golden?' "'You cannot eat gold,' the dog scoffed. "The cats rolled their eyes. 'Dogs,' the cats sighed." I should move him. Never tried this one. Let's go get the blood test. I mean, maybe, uh, it'll be more sensitive. I mean, tell us something else. No. I'm done. We're done. I know I can't... I can't do it anymore. [*]
