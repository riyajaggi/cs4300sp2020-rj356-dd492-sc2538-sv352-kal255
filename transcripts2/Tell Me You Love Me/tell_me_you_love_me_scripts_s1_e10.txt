 You're a quitter, you know that? You're a coward. You're like your father. You're a fucking coward. I know. Well, I'm not gonna be like your mother. I'm not just gonna let you leave. I'm pregnant. We're having a baby. Jesus Christ. You got what you wanted. Y-you don't need me. Get out of my way, please. No. Come on, Carol.

 Thanks. Hi. [CLOSES GAS TANK] Ticket. All right. Two this time. [CELL PHONE RINGS] [RINGING CONTINUES] Hello. [DISHES CLINKING] Josh didn't eat his meat again. [SIGHS] Should I save it? No, don't bother. Are you guys fighting? What?

 What? No, we're not fightin', sweetie. You're not talking. KATIE: Sometimes parents fight, Bella, but, you know, they work it out. I'm not getting married. DAVID: You don't mean that, sweetie. Yes, I do. [SIGHS] I think you'll change your mind. I don't want kids, either. Yes, you do. No, I don't. I've been good. Good. Yeah. Really? [LAUGHS] How? Uh, I don't kn-- Mm. I don't know, um-- I guess maybe I shouldn't be. I-- I stopped seeing Nick. Oh. I'm sorry. No. God, no. I-- It's been really good for me to be alone. Huh. I never thought I'd hear you say that. What do you mean? Ha. It's funny. What? Just, you know, all of it, I guess. Yeah. I gotta go. Me too. Bye. Bye. [SIGHS] [CARTOON PLAYING ON TV] NATE: Maybe you should just stay here tonight. Kids are up early, but-- Oh, it's okay. Thanks, man. I'm staying at my mother's. She's been out of town. Palm Beach. [GUNSHOTS] Ah, you know, you guys need to just take a break. You know? Get your mind to wrap around it, you know? We've had time. I spent a year wading through it. Look, who knows, in like ten years down the line you and Carol could have this little...whoever. And just laugh about this whole thing. I mean, it's not easy. It's a bonebreaking hellhole most of the time, but, uh, it does change you. It makes you a better person. You want another one? Um, yeah, if you are. Hell, yeah. You earned it. [CARTOON CONTINUES PLAYING] MAN [ON TV]: Dexter? With Dexter, Dexter and Dexter? This is impossible. It seems my old nemesis has not only been seriously resurfaced, but has also found a way to enlist the aid of himself from other times. No matter. Let them come. Oh, hey, Julia. Palek. How's Carolyn feeling? Haley, Dash, it's time for bed. Let's go. Come on, move it. Let's go. No bed, please. [LAUGHS] Come on. Move it. No, Ma. Look, it's time for bed. I-- Hey, you two buggers, come on. Let's go. Listen to your mom. Come on. I'll give you hugs and kisses. Mmm. Go brush your teeth. Let's go. Say goodnight to Palek. Night. Good night, Uncle Palek. Good night, sweetie. [NATE LAUGHS] [SNICKERS] Will you pick up the dry-cleaning? I have a late appointment tonight. Mm-hm. I don't know how retirement turned me into an errand boy. Have I been neglecting you? [CHUCKLES] No, just absent-minded. Let's talk about our vacation. You know, the one we've been planning for 10 years. Oh, here it comes. Oh, they could survive for a week without you. [PHONE RINGS] Hello. Who? Olivia! What--? When? What? Oh, no. [WHIMPERS] [SOBS] Are you okay? [SOBBING] Do you need anything? I'm so sorry, Olivia. Thank you for calling me. [HANGS UP] What? [HANGS UP] May? John had a heart attack. He's gone. What? He was alone. He died alone. [SOBBING] ARTHUR: Now... don't do this. [SNIFFLES] I led him on. I kept it going for myself. I didn't have to do that. [SNIFFLES] Stay home today. Oh, no, I can't. I'm-- I've got to go in. [SNIFFLES] Where's--? What do you need? JAIME: I ran into Hugo. Oh, how was that? It was great. Good. Yeah, I saw him at the gas station. The same place where, um, we broke up. Yeah, I-I don't know. I think there's something really right about that. Like, it was kinda meant to be. Mmm. Maybe. Is, um--? Is that a gas station that you use? Is it, um, near where you live, or, uh, where he lives? Yeah. Yeah, I go there. I mean, I don't know where he lives, but that's not the point. I mean, of all the places that I could've run into him, I run into him there? I mean, you have to admit it's just kind of... Destiny? No, more like fate. Maybe. I'm happy. I mean, I've never been happier than sitting outside that fucking gas station with him. Oh, good. I'm different with him. I've changed. I'm stronger, I'm less afraid. I'm in love with him. I've never stopped being in love with him. I mean, Nick was just a rebound. I mean, I know that and you know that. I mean... Jaime, if you're so sure, I don't think you'd be sitting here, selling me quite so hard. I'm not selling you. You're wrong. I'm sure sometimes that happens. [FAINTLY] Hm. Fuck. Finally. I've been waiting for you. What happened? We have a big problem. We were expecting 12-by-7 beams for the partition walls, we've got aluminum channel beams. The beams you gave me aren't certified for this kind of weight, so I'm paying 20 people to eat. All right, hold on. Hold on. Let-- Let me-- Let me just look at the work order. I don't have it here. I didn't expect to get fucked by you guys, so I don't have it. Well, I-- I-I can't do much without it. Call somebody to get it. You call somebody and get it. But you won't get very far with that kind of attitude. Wow. You know, everyone thinks that contractors do the shitty work, but it's you guys who give us the substandard material. What do you want me to do, huh? I want what I ordered. You don't know what you ordered. Okay, you get your super on the phone right now. All right, fine. Go ahead. Call him. Call him. I will. I'll call him. He'll tell you what I just told you. I can't help you without a work order. You don't have a work order, so guess what? I can't help you. Okay, you're a fuckin' asshole. Fuckin' dick. [CELL PHONE CLATTERS] Nice car. You fuck. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Hi. KATIE: Hey, are you okay? Yeah, fine. I'm workin'. What do you need? Nothing. I was just checkin' to see if you were still on with Dan. I forgot. Well, do you wanna cancel? [SIGHS] No, let's just get it over with. Okay. [SIGHS] I've gotta go back to the office and take care of some paperwork. Will you meet me there? Yeah, sure. All right, good. All right, I'll see you later. Hey, Dave. Yeah. I love you. I love you too. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Hello? Hi. Are you busy? I-- No. What's goin' on? I just, um-- You know, I didn't know if it was cool to call you or not. Yeah, it is. Okay, good. [CHUCKLES] Good. Is that it? No. [NERVOUS LAUGH] Uh, I'm hungry. Uh-huh. Yeah, I mean, uh-- You know, I-- I love the food at the Mix, and, uh, I-- But I haven't been able to come in there because, you know... Come in and eat. Really? Yeah. All right, I will. Okay, bye. Okay. MAN: Now get on it. WOMAN: All right. Yeah, I moved out. How does it feel? Uh, weird. Shitty. MAY: Carolyn? How does that feel? Feels like being left. Do you know what that feels like? Well, it was clear the last time you were here that you were at a crossroads. Do you feel this, uh, separation is permanent? Yeah. Yeah, the reason we're here is because there are things I want to say to him and he won't listen. I can't make Palek listen. Well, you can make him sit here. No, she can't. [STAMMERS] I came here because you asked me to, so what do you wanna say? I want you to know that you will never see this baby. It will have nothing to do with you. It won't be your child. It will hate you. You'll be worse than your father. And I don't give a fuck how he feels anymore. I don't care if he's hurt or confused, or any of it. I'm done. I'm finished. Yeah, me too. I guess I should've seen it coming. I mean, how many times did she tell me that she was unhappy and I didn't do anything to stop it? You guys are still talkin', though. Oh, yeah. I'm talkin' now. I'm the one talking. About asking her to try, asking her to-- To change. Ugh. I can't imagine what you're going through, Dan. DAN: No, you can't. DAN: Look-- [SIGHS] I hardly can, all right? I don't know. I-I'm not the one who wanted out. Right? DAVID: You're still talking to her on the phone. DAN: Yeah, I end up callin' her. I-- I don't know. I'm just gonna-- Hey. Hey. DAN: Have to tell the kids that Daddy's on business. Uh, so we don't have to order. I just asked one of the cooks in the back to make us a whole bunch of stuff. Oh, yeah? The one you slept with? I heard about it. No, he's not cooking your dinner. You know, we can talk about other shit. [EXHALES] I had to do it before you did. We need to order some drinks. The ironic thing is that she always wanted to talk, right? About her day, my day, the kids' day. Hell, your day. Nothing changes. Now the-- The house is so quiet I can't even sleep. DAN: Almost makes me wanna fuckin' cry. I'm sorry. I don't know. She sounds happy. Is she happy? So, what are you doing? What have you been up to? I haven't heard shit. Well, there's nothing to hear. I haven't been with anyone. Why not? Just...wasn't feeling it. You know, I always wanted Rita to be more like you. Heh. [SIGHS] You know, I don't know who has our table. DAVID: I'm, uh-- I'm gonna step away from here. I've seen those people before at the park where I was playing softball. Why were you playing softball? Mmm. Don't ask. You know, that lady was checking me out when I came in here. No, she wasn't. Yes, she was. [CHUCKLES] You think every woman is just checkin' you out. I never thought that. You did. Things change quickly and just take it one day at a time. Yeah, but aren't you supposed to stay? Stay and try to work things out. Why would you just leave? Oh, hey. DAN: Oh, man. God, I'm eatin' myself sick. I gained like a hundred pounds since we broke up. Aw. I like you like this. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Oh. Aw, shit. We're, uh, swamped. This is my section. Sorry, what can I get you to drink? [GROANS] Hugo, this is Anya. Nick's ex, now current. Hey. Hi, uh-- [CHUCKLES] I'll have a dark beer, please. Um, me too. ANYA: Okay. Be right back. Thanks. Don't. Anya. Don't. Thank you. Let me get this. No, no. It's on us. It's on us. I already took care of it. Heh. Yep. DAN: Thank you both. For everything, for listening. Oh, no, no. No, hey. It's all right. DAN: Thanks. Ready? Mm-hm. Okay. DAVID: Yeah. You see? You see? What? She was looking at me. HUGO: Why? JAIME: I don't know. Maybe she recognizes me. Here you go. Let me just take that for you. [LAUGHS] She wasn't checking you out. MAN [ON TV]: A strange piece of rock that looks like driftwood-- [KNOCK AT DOOR] It's encased in glass... [SIGHS] CAROLYN: Hi. Hi. I came to say, uh... What? I came to say I'm sorry. For what I said. I didn't mean it. I think you did. But it's okay. I mean, at least it was honest. I wanted this so much, Palek. Not just for me. For us. With you. If you can't do this, I understand you can't be a father. I do. I see that. But I still love you. I know... I know you love me. I love you. But that has nothing to do with this. It has everything to do with this. I have to go. Okay. What is this? Hmm. How long--? What is it? What is that? What does it mean? It means I was acting out, because you dumped me, is what it means. Really? Should I get one too, because you dumped me? Do you wanna go get a drink? Nah. What are you doing? I'm showing off for you. [LAUGHS] Oh. It's working. Good. [SIGHS] We can't. I don't know how not to. I don't know either, but we can't. I can't. I know. I know. [SIGHS] I know. I can't go through it, the breaking up with you again, the losing you again. I can't. Me either. [LAUGHS] Okay. [CHIMES JINGLE] I mean, when I saw you for the first time, I felt like I wanted to run away. I did. I wanted to bail. HUGO: Why didn't you? It was too late. You know, I remember the first time we had sex. What about it? How boring it was. Oh, shut up. Then I remember being scared. [SIGHS] Nervous. I knew we were going to that night. I didn't. I didn't even think you wanted to. Come on. I always want to. I will always want to. I knew we would be together after that. No, you didn't Yes, I did. I never felt that way before in my life. And I never thought I would. When you proposed to me, I wanted to die. I was so happy. Me too. But...? I'd already cheated on you. And it was like my stomach just dropped. I was so in love with you. And I knew what I had done, and I just didn't know how to deal with it. So... I decided that you were the cheater. Healthy. [LAUGHS] I forgive you. Jesus. You do not wanna make this fucking easy on me, do you? I would never have forgiven you. I mean, I can't even forgive myself. Are you awake? Hello? Okay. Good night. I love you. I heard that. I love you too. I can't imagine life without you. Being old without you. What happens if I fuck up again? I mean, what happens if I destroy us? It's better than the alternative. I love you. I love you. [SIGHS] Shit, that was fast. Yeah, there was no one in line. I barely got a drag in. Well, walk ahead of me. I'll stay downwind. Just put it out, Mason. Fine. You know that stuff about secondhand smoke is total bullshit. There's worse stuff in the air you breathe-- Uh-huh. --and the water you drink. Uh-huh. Did you at least get what you needed? You look a little puffy. Yeah, I got what I needed. Let's get you out to eat. I'm not hungry. Well, when do you start having weird cravings? Is that soon? Uh, I don't know. So far, I just feel nauseous. Do you pee a lot more? No. You should get a live-in. I don't want a live-in. Well, I could help. [SCOFFS] You know, I could-- I could watch it during the day. I could carry it around in one of those, like, papoose things, or like an Albee stroller or whatever. I have those. Uh, I know you're tryin' to help, but I think it's gonna be better if you just walk next to me and don't say much. Okay. [LAUGHS] You know what? Let's get lunch. Okay. So you're back. Yeah. I'm sorry about last week. Um, something came up and I just-- I, um-- I didn't think. I'm sorry. It's okay. But Dave came, so it didn't go to waste. MAY: No, it didn't. Did, uh, you and Dave talk about our session? Um, kind of. Uh, we didn't talk much about it. I mean, it's not like she asked me a lot of questions. [SIGHS] MAY: Well, I'm glad you're here, back together again. Katie, I know that you've had some doubts about coming back. Yeah. I've had doubts about a lot of things. I know. [EXHALES] It's been about a week. Why? What happened? [CLEARS THROAT] Uh, some friends of ours, Rita and Dan, broke up. MAY: And that was unexpected? Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hm. She isn't happy. She-- She hasn't been for a long time. Actually, it's not that surprising. You know, I mean, my other friend, Sally, she's-- She's divorced and-- And Dave has this-- This weird friend Jeff and he's divorced. And half the people we know are divorced. It's like we're the only couple who's still together, you know? Hm. And I'm having trouble coming up with reasons why anymore. Which is probably why Katie slept on the couch most of the week. Not only did she sleep on the couch, she cancelled therapy. Looked for a new job. Went shopping, bought new clothes, put on makeup. Changed her mind about having a baby. Changed her mind about everything. And then she started sleeping on the couch. [GRUNTS] I mean, what--? What--? What does that sound like to you? MAY: I think the question, Dave, is what does it sound like to you? Not good. I slept on the couch not because of you, but because of me. DAVID: Right. I just... I just couldn't climb into our bed. I don't know. Something snapped, and I just couldn't be that woman. [SOBS] And I hate the way I feel, you know? I do. It's awful. It's... [SIGHS] Why are we not enough anymore? I don't know. I don't know. [EXHALES] I'm old. Heh. I don't recognize my body. I don't know who I am when I go out, when-- When men see me or don't see me. I feel like I've left who I am somewhere, and I can't find it. I mean, before, I was always part of us. You know? I was-- I was yours, your wife. Their mother. But now there's, like, this-- There's like this big separation from all of that, and... I feel fully and totally lost. You know? Sex is the least of it, really. I came in here because we weren't having sex, and I thought if we could have it, everything would be okay again, you know? But now I know why we stopped having sex and you know what? It's not because we're busy and the kids and we're tired. He said, "We don't even know each other." You know? It's all fucking gone. I-- I know who you are. I-- I remember the woman I met. Yeah, but you know what? That's the problem. That's the problem. I don't wanna be who you see. That's not who I wanna be. [SNIFFLES] Yeah. Yeah, well... [SIGHS] ...I didn't just come out of the box like this. This is 12 long years of not always doing what I wanna do, either. Someone once told my husband and me that no one else could be in our relationship. And I think that's true. And also that we had to find the courage to be happy. MAY: And I think that's true too. [SIGHS] The one thing a therapist can do, perhaps in times of darkness, is turn a light on. I've been listening to you, and I think we've accomplished that. MAY: The trick now is not to be so stunned by the glare that you wanna turn it back off. [ELEVATOR DINGS] DOCTOR: Where's Palek today? Did he have to work? Yeah. Well, I didn't wanna bother him with this. I mean, I'm paranoid about all this stuff. Cramping's normal, right? Usually, yeah. We'll just take a quick look. What? It's fine. What? Why don't you give your husband a call? There's a couple things we need to check out here, okay? I'm so sorry. Miscarriages are somewhat common in first pregnancies. DOCTOR: There was no obvious reason for it. I'm gonna recommend a month for your hormones to regulate. But then you guys could try again. I know how painful this is. I'm very sorry. Don't. Carolyn-- Just leave. You're only here 'cause it's gone. That's why you came, 'cause I lost it. That's not true. Just-- I don't want you, I don't need you here. I'm-- Just leave. I'm taking you home. Hi. Hello, hello. Um... We're here-- Ha-ha. We're here to get married. Well, good. It'll be $250. Cash. [WHISPERS] Okay. Heh. I don't have enough. [LAUGHS] [CLEARS THROAT] [WHISPERS] That should work. Thank you. [LAUGHS] I'll pay you back. [SMOOCHING] Mm. Uh, that's it. Uh, do we need to sign anything or--? [TAP RUNNING] [TAP STOPS] I wish we'd never gone. Tsk. The hell we supposed to do now? Well, I don't know. [SIGHS] Well, you know, we-- We were falling apart. And you weren't doing anything, so I-- I was trying to help us, you know? I was trying to save us. Well, that-- That really worked. Then leave me, Dave. Leave me. Fuck you. [PHONE CLATTERS] [BREATHES DEEPLY] [BREATHES DEEPLY] It'll be just a couple of minutes. I have to get the witness. Thanks. You don't have to stay. I know I don't. I'm fine. No, you're not. I'm not. [SIGHS] Can I get you anything? Cup of tea? Scotch? Yes, thanks. [SIGHS] This came today. I thought you might like to see it. Mmm. [CHUCKLES] Heh. "To Arthur, "for listening, "and for the men and women "who have the courage to be happy." [*] [LAUGHS] Get-- [GIGGLES] [*] Move over. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [PANTING] [MOANS] [MOANS] Mmm. [BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY] [MOANING] Ooh. Ooh. [MOANS] [BOTH PANTING] [BOTH MOANING] [PANTS] [BOTH SIGH] [*] [PHONE CLATTERS] [LAUGHING] I love you. I love you. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] [*]
