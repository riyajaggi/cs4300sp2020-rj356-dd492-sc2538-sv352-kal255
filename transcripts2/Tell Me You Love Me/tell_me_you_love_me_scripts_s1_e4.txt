 89, 90. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-- We're three short. How? Count them again. Open it up. Look-- Oh, Christ, he's got three in his mouth. There we go. Let's say there's 100, okay? He's supposed to get a hundred. I know, honey, but it's fine. No, it is not. It's how I learned to count. So mix these in, and hurry. I'm trying. My head itches. No, it doesn't. Isabella, get your stuff. You're taking them, right?

 Yeah. You need me to, right? Yeah. What time's your thing? Nine-thirty. I'm gonna meet you there. Where's the lid? Oh, I love you, sweetie. Have a good day. Izzy, have a good day. Uh, great. Uh, much better. [DOOR CLOSES] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hi. Hi. I'm in Mr. Sanders's class. I saw you pick him up once. Are you his girlfriend? WOMAN: Yeah. Hey, you got to get to class. Hey. Hi. You doing all right? No. I miss you. We got the coffeemaker. Someone from, like, Dakota sent it to us. Some weird relative. Keep it. You don't want it. No. Why didn't you call me back? I couldn't. Because...? Jaime, this isn't about some stupid thing I said and how you reacted. It's-- It's something else. I don't know what it is, exactly, but it's-- It's-- It's just-- What? What is it? I felt like we were on drugs the whole time we were together. And now I feel like I'm not. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm away from the drug. You know, I-- I-- I'm in detox. It doesn't feel good, but it feels right. Well, it doesn't feel right to me. It feels shitty. It-- It feels wrong. It feels awful. Look, I love you, okay? I love everything about you. Not everything. I think we're doing the right thing. I really do. Why? Because... marriage is a long time. And I think that you should be with someone who makes you happy. [BELL RINGS] I gotta go. Mwah. Okay. Okay what? When the light goes off, we can go. Come on. Okay. Dr. Foster? Ahem. Uh, this is my husband, Dave. [DOOR CLOSES] I gathered that. Please. Just sit on the couch. [CLEARS THROAT] So you're here. I'm here. What made you come in? Uh... I don't know. I just... How did you feel about Katie's decision to come without you? I felt great. [CHUCKLES]: Dave. Well, that's one of those questions where you know the answer, but you ask it anyway. We have a lot of those in here. I'm here because it means a lot to Katie. Good. But it's meant a lot to Katie for some time, so why did you decide to come now? I wanted to support my wife. Okay. How was the anniversary? Great. The steak was great. Uh, Katie got me TiVo, which was incredible. [CLEARS THROAT] Anything else? Well, I-- I got a purple teddy. Oh, Isabella picked it out. Really? Yeah. I mean, it's-- She-- She thought that Katie would like it. Do you? [LAUGHS]: Well, um, you know, it's purple and there, uh-- There's not very much of it-- It's-- It's really not my style, you know? And... it sort of took me by surprise, you know? At first-- It-- It's okay. It didn't really come from Dave, so... You know. You know what I mean. [SIGHS] Is this some kind of standoff? Well, then, say something. I feel both of you are in a lot of pain. I know Katie wants to be close to you again. Oh, honey. I'm good. No, honey. No, I'm good. I-- Our-- Our anniversary was great. It was great. I mean, the kids were there, and it was-- Katie looked beautiful, and it was, uh... Anniversary was-- It was-- It was what? What? Uh... And after, we came home, and-- And I don't-- I, uh... Just say it, Dave. What? [SIGHS] You act like I have something to say and I don't say it. You do. Just say it. The other night, you kept saying, "But what? But what?" Like, because I have nothing to say, it's my fault. What is your fault? All of it. I never said that. Yes, you did. No, I didn't. I said, "But what?" And what does that mean? It's-- It-- It's some frustrating language for, "It's your fault. I'm disappointed in you." No, it isn't. Yes, it is. Maybe you could let go of what you said and try to understand what both of you were feeling. Katie? Dave sounds like he feels that you were saying something more than just what you said. Well, I wasn't. Yes, you were. No, I wasn't. Oh, Jesus. What? Mm, I-- Never mind. I can't-- I can't win. I can't. And you know what? I don't-- I-- I don't even care anymore. Ugh, you know, that's not fair. [SCOFFS] [SIGHS] This is fun. Uh, I'm gonna make sure and come back. I'm really, really glad that you're here, Dave. How much time's left? [SNIFFS] [CLEARS THROAT] I-- I wanted you to-- I wanted you to tell me that you wanted me to stay. I wanted you to make me stay. Well, then, why didn't you ask? I did. No, you didn't. That's not true. You're just-- It's true. Yes, it was. You didn't. You said that you had steak hair. You needed to take a shower. Well, why did you think I wanted to take a shower? I don't know. Why didn't you just say that? Did I really have to on our anniversary? Yeah, you had to. Did I really have to? Yes, because that's a crock. I mean, what am I supposed to do? Why is it all on me? I guess, yeah, you know what? I should be in the mood every time I clean out the gecko cage. Everybody else is, it seems. You know what else turns me on? I'll tell you what turns me on. Buying Cheerios is really hot. And then of course, going and getting shoelaces or fantasizing about minivans. That's sexy too. I really want to do that. That's excellent foreplay. Or you know what else is good foreplay? When you are comparing apple juice prices and they both don't even want to be in the grocery store, but you know you gotta get back because they gotta be fed before they go to bed. And then at bed, all you're doing is just reading to them probably telling them the same goddamn story for the hundredth time. Then, after all that, then I am ready to have sex, because that-- All that is so hot. Our entire life. That's what you just trashed. Our entire life. [TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING] [NEEDLE BUZZES] You all right? Yeah. [NEEDLE RESUMES BUZZING] It's Columbus Day. The kids are at home. They want to go home with their kids. Hey, you're not gonna get anything from them, anyway. We're already behind. I've got... Uh, let's just start, okay? Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I didn't know. Oh. Are you okay? What's wrong? I bought a pregnancy test. Oh-- Okay. Okay, well, we'll, um-- I can-- We can-- Wait, isn't it--? Is it early? No, I could have done it on Day 10, but I waited. Two fucking days I waited. Okay, okay, okay. Look, we'll do it together and, uh, no matter what, we'll figure it out, all right? But I already did it. [SIGHS]: All right. I don't know what to do, Palek. I really... I don't know what to do. Try again. And we'll keep trying, okay? And we'll go to work, we'll get on with the day. It'll be okay. Oh, you keep saying everything's fine. Will be fine. It'll be fine. We're not fine. I didn't say everything is fine. I said it will be okay. Now, can we talk about this later? Later? It's been a year. Uh, I'm at work. Aren't you upset? Yes, I'm upset, but we have to find some balance, okay? Now, we're not pregnant. I know it's awful, but we're not sick. We're not dying. Get perspective. Go home. I'm-- Fuck. [PHONE LINE RINGING] [CELL PHONE RINGS] Hey. Hi. Guess where I am. I don't know. Costa Rica? Hair Fairy's Oh, shit. Yup. Infested. Again? Ugh. Yeah, the nurse sent Josh home full of nits. I came right in. You're probably gonna be next. Jesus. Oh! Where are you? Getting gas. Everything okay? Yup. Uh, the loan went through on the car. I should be able to pick it up tomorrow or Friday. Good. Anything? Not yet. I think I'm clean. Good. How you doing? I'm all right. How about you? Good. You know. Good. I'm sorry. I-- That wasn't-- I-- That stuff I said. I-- I-- You know I didn't mean that. Yes, you did. No, honey, I didn't. Not-- Not like that. It's okay. It's true. Oh, I, um, I made an appointment for tomorrow for Isabella with Dr. Cohen. Good. Do you want me to go? Yeah, but don't you have to work? Yeah-- Uh, yeah, but I-- I can-- I can figure it out. You sure? Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure. Uh, I don't know if Isabella would really want me in there, but-- I do. [SIGHS] You, uh, need anything on my way home? No. No. Okay, see you. [OIL SIZZLES] What happened? I don't know. Life got too tough. Boyfriend trouble? Carrot overload. [MAN TALKING OVER TV] I'm gonna miss you. You can't come at me at work, huh? I know. I'm sorry. I was... I don't know. Just-- I'm sorry. I just don't want to lose us in this, you know? I had an abortion. When? Years ago. In college. And I just, you know-- I wonder if there's, like, some connection. That's the reason why-- So you've been pregnant? Yeah. Once. Is that why you've been blaming me this whole year? Is because, uh, someone else got you pregnant, so it must be my fault? No. I never-- I never-- I never thought that. So you're telling me now because I got tested and it's not my fault, so ma-- Maybe it's yours? I'm telling you because I'm having a hard time living with it, and I-- I wanted to share it with you. Yeah. How old would the kid be now? Ten. [GROANS] It was very good to see you again, Isabella. Honey, Daddy's in the waiting room. Why don't you get him and you guys can raid the toy chest, okay? This is not normal, is it? Ten is young, but we are seeing it more and more. The average age for menstruation has dropped from 14 to 12. Jesus, I was almost 16. It'll probably continue to drop. Too many environmental estrogens in our milk, meat, plastic wrap, water bottles. Men have more estrogen than ever before, and women have more breast cancer than ever before. It's like a horror movie. It's not that bad. Isabella will be fine. Thanks, Dr. Cohen. [DOOR OPENS] Hey. Hi. Where's Palek? Oh, he's stuck at work. He'll join us as soon as he can. Do you want to wait for him? No. We don't have to. Okay. So, what's going on? Uh, not much. I lost in Rite Aid. [CHUCKLES] Thin blue line. Or in my case, no blue line. I'm sorry. Not as much as I am. Well, that's true. How does Palek feel? Uh, he's upset. He's not as upset. It's a big deal, but not that big a deal. I think Palek cares very much. Yeah, you can tell. [CHUCKLES] I mean, he cares, but... He can think about other things, you know? Books and buildings and music and dinner. I can't. When I told him, he was sorry-- You told him? You didn't take the test together? No. You know, it's very hard when you, uh, shut people out and then ask them to be with you. Yeah, I know. Well, it gets worse. Last night, I told Palek I had an abortion when I was in college. Mm. I mean, that's not why I'm not pregnant. I've been examined. I'm fine. There's no connection. It's just... Carolyn? Are you fine? Dumb question. How does Palek feel? He's not here, so you tell me. He's ignoring my calls. Is he? Yeah, watch. [DIALS] [PHONE LINE RINGS] PALEK'S VOICE: Hi, this is Palek. Leave a message. [MACHINE BEEPS] [PHONE BEEPS OFF] I don't blame him for not being here. I mean, this is my thing, you know? I have to get over it. I have to find a way to get past it so I can move forward. It's a tough trip to take on your own. Well, I've done it my whole life. Maybe you're ready to stop. Maybe. I mean, they really scared the crap out of me, Dave. Oh, honey, that's their job. They have to tell you all the bad stuff so they don't get sued. Not only is it all the stuff that we eat and the plastic but it's what they see. You know, the sex, the nudity. That triggers sexual thoughts, and that triggers puberty. That's a stretch. We control what she's exposed to and still it's bad. I don't know about that, honey. I mean, that stuff is everywhere. Mm. I gotta go to work. No, she's almost done. [GIRLS LAUGHING] He is so cute. Oh, my God. GIRL: Okay, I'm gonna try. So, um... GIRLS: Hi. Hello. ...what's the deal with the therapist? Is she, uh...? Is she married? Does she have kids? KATIE: Married. DAVID: She have kids? KATIE: I don't know. GIRL: Don't get large. DAVID: Don't you ask? How fat are you? KATIE: No, Dave, I don't. Why? I don't know. I think a little experience always helps. Did you hate going? I don't know. I didn't hate it. Can we go? Yeah, sweetie. GIRL 1: What else can we get? GIRL 2: Oh, a shake. Shake. Shake. You have chocolate shakes? Wait, can I get a--? Let me hear. I'm gonna talk. Don't worry. Yeah, I'm sorry. Whatever. Steel guy's gonna be late. How late? Ah, maybe another 40 minutes. Says there's traffic. Shit. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Thanks. Hey, you want a coffee? Uh, no, I'm gonna get one. If he gets here, make sure he waits. Got it. I think it looks really good. Yeah. Do you have any other colors? Uh, I think black, but you know, I'm gonna have to check. Oh, that's okay. I think I like the blue. Are you sure? Yeah, don't you? I like it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You look really good. I'm gonna get the black too. Really? Yeah, why not? You should. [GIGGLES] I cannot believe you are in charge of 50 people. You could barely make it to class. Well, we change, don't we? Yeah, we do. And what about you? Miss Big-time Lawyer. Well, what did you expect? Uh, I don't know. [BOTH LAUGH] Do you guys have kids? Yeah. Two boys. Oh. You? Not yet. Do you ever think about it? About what happened? No. Do you? Sometimes. Yeah. Sometimes I wonder if we put the universe on notice. If we created some kid of karmic debt or, I don't know. No. We would have created one if we hadn't done it. We were kids. We did the right thing. No, I know. No, I'm not saying I regret it. I just wonder if... I don't know. [LAUGHS] What was I like back then? Ha! You were fun. Smart. Strong. Not the kind of girl who talked about karma or the universe. Okay. Okay. [LAUGHS] [CHUCKLES] Hey, where is he? Right over there. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Hey. Oh, hey. You the guy from Rail Co.? I am. Sorry I'm late. I had a thing with my kid. That's okay. I understand. Do you have kids? Not yet. And in no hurry. Oh. What do you got for me? Oh, I think you're gonna be happy. Okay. All right, this was the first proposal we talked about... Right. ...I want him to take care of me, not-- I don't want him to be, like, violent. That doesn't mean, I mean, I want him to be aggressive. Like, it's something different-- Oh, Jaime. Get back here. I'm going home. No, you're not. I'm tired. Come on, stay for an hour. No, I'm tired. One hour. I don't want-- You can spare an hour. What better do you have to do? Oh, hey. She still around? I think she took off. [LAUGHS]: Really? Yeah. I mean, check in the back. She could still be here. It's possible. Do you know Jaime? Mm-mm. Jaime, this is Nick. Nick, Jaime. Hi. Hi. Yeah, so, you try. [CELL PHONE RINGS] All right. Sorry. Ugh! I gotta go. Come on, just stay. No, I gotta go. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hi. WOMAN [OVER PHONE]: Hugo's mother called again. You need to sign that new lease so it's in your name only. And honey, I don't want to be in the middle of this. But you know what? I don't want to be in the middle of this either. I know, but what you want and what you have to do are two different things. You moved too fast and you were too young. But I'm 27, Mom. And you've never really been good at taking responsibility. I'm sorry this is hard for you, but you have to take care of it. You know what? I can't fucking deal with this. I gotta go. Fuck it. You threw out everything? KATIE: I didn't throw it out. I recycled it. Well, still. I mean, Joshie's Transformers Bella's doll collection? Well, the Barbie's had to go. They'll double culprits. Just makes me wonder what's next. Do you like the curtains? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I like them. They're good. You know what I was thinking about? What? Remember at my mom's funeral how that weird guy was singing and-- And you got him to leave? Kind of. What was he singing, again? Oh, I can't remember. Just-- Tina Turner. Oh. Aretha? [BOTH LAUGH] Mwah. You were great that day. You weren't just saying that I remind you of your mother, were you? What? No. Good. Not-- Not even close. [SIGHS] I wish we hadn't gotten pregnant so soon. I wish we'd had more time at the beginning. Hm. Yeah. Dave? Are you still attracted to me? Oh, honey. Oh. Yes. Have you ever had an affair? Uh, don't answer that. [LAUGHS] Never. Never have. Never will. Have you? No. Have you ever wanted to? You? Not in any real way. You know? Yeah. I know. Good night. Good night. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Good luck getting any of your shit back, man, because she's pissed. Yeah, I know. I'm gonna go get a drink. You want anything? No. I'm done. What? Look, I'm fucking toxic, okay? I'm a mess. I'm doing you a favor. Thanks. Hello? Hey. Hey. Do you want a drink? Oh, no, thanks. I just had one. Did you go to work today? I did. How was it? You know. Busy. Bought a BlackBerry. Good. Tried calling you a couple of times. Crazy day. Yeah, me too. Everything was late, and those guys just don't want to work. It's pretty much a wasted day. But I bought a suit. Oh, yeah? What, right around 11:00? Buy me anything? No, but I will. What do you want me to buy you? I don't know. Something big. Okay. I called the OB today. Made an appointment. Okay. What--? For what? Well, this isn't working and we're not working, so I want to inseminate. If that's what you want. Yeah, it is. So come on. Let me see your suit. Try it on for me. Sure. It's up there. Go get it. [SCOFFS]: I'm not gonna go get it. You go get it. So should I just start? Yes, just start. Um... I don't know why this always feels so hard. Have you been in therapy before? Yeah. When? Uh, a few times in high school. Anyway, I just broke up with someone. My fiancé. And basically I'm a mess and I'm really acting out. What's his name? Hugo. How long were you together? A year. But it was, like, a real year. You know? We just knew almost as soon as we met. What happened? Why did it end? Well, do you want the whole story? I mean, it's not simple. Um... it was love. I know that. You know, and-- And there was a lot of sex, but it wasn't just sex, you know? We were really, really connected. And, you know, we were the best when we were in bed, but not just having sex, you know? We were just lying there. It was just us. And we never fought. You know, and then the minute we stepped out of bed, all we did was fight. But it's my fault, you know? I-- I'm an idiot, and I started it. And then, of course, you know, I made sure I ended it. I've known you for 10 minutes, Jaime. You don't seem like an idiot. Thanks. It's-- You know, I'm just-- I'm really, really jealous. And Hugo is-- Was really, really honest. And I asked him to promise me that he would never be with someone else. And he didn't want to do that. So, I fucking just-- I'm sorry. I drove him away. Because he wouldn't promise or because he wouldn't be faithful? Oh. I don't know. That was the problem. You know, he's a flirt. And he's really, really cute. And girls love him. You know? And he plays that. Mm, it just drive me nuts. You said that you were in therapy when you were in high school. Why did you go? Oh, God. My parents made me. They caught me in bed with my boyfriend, and, like, the next day, I had an appointment. But, I mean, I liked it, you know? We talked. And it was nice to be around a guy and talk. I defined myself by sex. That's what we figured out. You know? Oh, whatever. I didn't need to pay you 110 bucks to tell me what my issues are. But he wasn't wrong. I lost my virginity when I was 14 years old and I have not been alone since. You broke up with Hugo because he, uh, wouldn't commit. I broke up with Hugo because I couldn't trust him and because he couldn't do what I needed him to do so that I could trust him. Which was what? Promise me he'd never be with someone else. Are you comfortable being monogamous? Um... Have you ever been monogamous? No.
