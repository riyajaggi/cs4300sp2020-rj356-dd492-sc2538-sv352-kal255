 JAIME: Aw, that's amazing. I didn't even notice this last time. You know, I wanna do all the shades white. That'd be good. You know what I nt? What? I want a coffee maker with a timer. Um, I'm sure someone will buy it for us, you know. Like my mother's friend or your mother's friend. Hey, what did Julian get us? Huh? What do you think?

 Drug dealer. Mmm. It was nice of you to buy breakfast. Well, you know teachers. We're overpaid. You know that's why you're marrying me. Definitely. Do you know her? The waitress? What waitress? The one you were talking to. What? It was like an hour ago, Hugo, come on. Heh. Uh, come on, don't.

 But-- Don't. I'm saying, you didn't mention picking up the check until you went up and flirted with the cute little waitress. I didn't flirt. It's okay. Look. Hey. I love you. Okay? I really fucking love you. Don't go there, okay? Please. Okay. I'm sorry. [WHISPERS] I'm sorry. Oh. Ooh. [BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY] Mmm. Just be honest with me. Tell me you were flirting. What? I hate it when you lie to me. [SIGHS] Oh, my God, I've never seen so many people. Mom, I need new binders. What? I need new binders. Yeah, we're gonna get to the school aisle in a minute. I also-- ISABELLA: Hey, Mom, can I get a new hairbrush? KATIE: Uh, yeah, honey, I guess, after. Though we'll get that later, honey. I gotta get this stuff first. KATIE: Oh, here we go. [SIGHS] [SIGHS] DAVID: Get back in, buddy. Hop up. Where'd your mom go? I don't know. Oh. Honey? Katie? Come on, come on. Hold the pole. DAVID: Katie? David, what? Dave, you're yelling across the aisle. Honey, we gotta go. Usually we stick close. Stick close. Okay, did you get the glue sticks yet or the pipe cleaners or the calculators or-- Come on, come on, come on. Stay on, stay on. Come on. Hold on. DAVID: Oh, there they are. All right, see, thi-- This is why I need you. I need you to stay with me. It's like a military operation. You're the captain. Dave. And we need to get out of here fast and get out alive. I know, honey. [SIGHS] Okay. Let's go. Ten bucks. Choo-choo-choo. [FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS] [TOILET FLUSHES] Hey. I'm surging. I'm estrogenic. Okay. [FOOTBALL GAME PLAYING ON TV] MAN [ON TV]: Fowler, crossing-- Oh! He stays on his feet. And now he's brought down. And, uh... [FOOTSTEPS] [TURNS TV OFF] [SIGHS] I can't deal. I-- I really can't. You flirt and I hate it. No, you're wrong. I don't flirt. It's the same fucking fight. We have the same fight over and over again. Yup. It's just like that time when we were in Austin, and you got a beer without asking me if I wanted one. Oh, great. No, but then you got one for the girl with the long arms, and talked to her for 20 minutes while I stood there like a retard, wondering how you could abandon me. What are you talking about? I asked you if you wanted a beer. No, you didn't. I don't want to be with someone who's sitting in a corner sulking because I'm not there. I know that's not who you are, but it's how you act. Don't turn this on me. It's true, you've changed. No, I haven't. You have. You know, you're right. It's my fault. It's my shit, I'll deal with it. Deal with what? [GROANS] Deal with what? Ju-- Forget it. Forget it. Just-- Fuck. I'm dying of thirst. Can we just go somewhere to drink? [SNIFFLES, SIGHS] [SIGHS] [DOG BARKING] [SIGHS] Okay. [CLEARS THROAT] [BOTH SIGH] [GRUNTING SOFTLY] [PANTS] Uh-huh. You ready? [BOTH SIGHING] Okay. Just stay, just stay, just stay. Oh, okay, sorry. Good. We still need to get Josh his cleats. I thought they'd hold through this season, but I-I-I don't think they will. Well, okay. We have been spending a lot of money lately. Well, Dave, you know, we're about to buy a new car, and we really don't need it. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. I'm fine. Y-you needed a car. I mean, it's a car. At least, that's a necessity. Unlike what, Dave? Insurance is paying for the therapy, right? No, Dave. They only pay once I'm institutionalized. They don't pay for once-a-week couples counseling. Who pays for it? We do. [SCOFFS] And you still call it couples therapy even when it's just you that's going. [SIGHS] I guess. I don't know. Why are you mad at me? I'm not mad, you know, it's just-- What? Never mind. How long are you gonna go? I mean, two sessions. Is that--? Is there a set number of times? You don't buy it in a set, Dave. Well, how do you know when you're done? KATIE: I don't know. I mean, it took us, what, at least a year to get here? Year? Come on. A year is-- Because that's ridiculous. A year is ridiculous. Dave, either come with me or stay out of it, okay? Well, I guess I'll stay out of it. I'm out of it. John got ahold of me. How's he doing? Sounded fine. He's probably not fine. It's only been, what, about a year since the funeral? What'd he have to say? Well, I didn't speak to him, he just-- And left a message. Their daughter lives in town, um, now, and I think he's coming to see her. What does his daughter do? I'm not sure. Um, I think she's a waitress. Something like that. [CLEARS THROAT] I'm high. Me too. [*] [JOSH AND ISABELLA YELLING] KATIE: What did Betty and John get? KATIE: It's just-- Okay, okay, okay. All right. Tickle in the middle. [KATIE GIGGLES] Tickle. Tickle in the mid-- [SHRIEKS] Oh, don't-- I got-- Oh. Oh, you poor guy. JOSH: I got it, I got it, I got it. [MEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Wow. [BOTH SIGH] [GIGGLES] [BOTH PANTING] JAIME: Fuck. That's just how much it costs. You know? What do you want me to do? Don't have a floor? Hi. Hi. Yeah, no, I-I-I love you too, but I still need something to walk on. Here, Carol-- Carolyn's here. Talk to her about it. Dad wants to talk to you. No way. Talk to him. It's-- It's about the house. Oh, I'm off today. DAD [ON PHONE]: Are you there? Will somebody please talk to him? DAD: Hello? Is that alcohol? DAD: Hello? No alcoho. Uh, Dad, we're just, uh, eating, but she says she'll call you when we're done. Yeah. Bye. How does he manage to be here even when he's not? He's trying to drastically cut my spending, so I would appreciate a little backup. Well, I could have used you not shoving a phone in my face. You put me on the spot. Thank you. Sorry. Can I get the waiter? Sure. [BABY CRYING] MASON: Oh, jeez. Are you kidding me with that? Why don't they take it outta here? Or something. [CRYING CONTINUES] Yeah. Thanks. Maybe I should, like, pop one out. Then Dad would really come with the dough. [LAUGHING] Well, I'm just so over these brunches. It's just too much. It's not too much, Mason. Come on. It's what we do. It is for me. I mean, it's not fun. I don't look forward to it. I mean, do you? I mean, Palek, do you? Don't answer that. Okay, I won't, but if I was going to, I think I would say, "She has a point." I'm gonna get the waiter. Yeah, and you know what? Stop trying to be my mother. Good thing about a dead mom is that you don't have obligations like this. And wherever she is, I don't think she'd give a shit about brunch. Okay, fine, we'll stop. If you care so much about family, then why--? Why don't you invite Dad? Because Dad's a dick. Well, who isn't? And he's really not so much anymore. He's old. Whatever. He's still a dick. No, he's not. My God, didn't we establish your dad was a dick, like, four years ago? Besides, every dad's a dick. Uh-uh. Every time we get together, you talk like it's something new. Yeah, exactly. And that's why I don't wanna come-- Fine, I'm not gonna force you. Don't come. You know-- Whoa. I'm gonna go to the kitchen and see if Jaime can get us some food or, like, a shotgun or, you know, something. If she gets pregnant before I do, I'm gonna kill myself. I know you are. I thought y-you weren't happy. I thought that's why you're going to therapy. No, yeah, I am. I mean, not all the time, but, you know. Yeah. You don't act unhappy. I mean, with the kids you're-- You're happy. You're really, really happy. Well, yeah, I am. Well, so how can--? How come you can act happy for them and not for me? Because, I-I-I don't know. Because we-- We're parents. It's what we do. You know, we shelter them. We don't expose them to our stuff and... Well, maybe we should shelter each other a little more. [DOORBELL CHIMES] [CUSTOMERS TALKING INDISTINCTLY] CASHIER: Here's your change. [DOORBELL CHIMES] [DOOR BEEPS, OPENS] [HUGO SIGHS] You want me to drive? No. No. What? [LAUGHS] What? Nothing. Tell me. [CLEARS THROAT] Remember, um, a couple of weeks ago, when we were in the car, and, uh, you said that you would never be with anybody else? Were you--? [SPLUTTERS] That was a lie, right? [LAUGHS] [GROANS] I can't have this conversation anymore, seriously. [SIGHS] I can't let it go. That's right, because every time I see you with someone else now, I wonder. I mean, I watch you and I look for shit, and that's just-- That's fucked up. Why do you do that? Why? You know I don't wanna be with anyone else, you know that. Look, what we have-- Do you think I would ever share that with anyone else? That belongs to us. Okay? But when you push me into a corner like this, I feel fucking dead. Yeah, but when you make a commitment, when you ask someone to marry you, I mean, that means that there won't even be a possibility of a someone else. Look, just let it go. Okay? Let it go and it won't ever happen. I can't. I need to be in love with someone who trusts me. You should be. I just don't think it's me. Hi. Hey. MAY: Hello. Oh, yeah. [CLEARS THROAT] [BEEPS] [BOTH SIGH] So, what's going on? Uh, not much. How about you? I'm very well, thank you. Good. Did you try again this month? [LAUGHS] Well, yeah, we try every month. Mm-hm. Actually, we-- We tried yesterday. How was the intimacy between you? It was good. It was good. Actually, uh, it felt strange. Feels like, uh, we're... connecting over, um, something that d-doesn't exist, and, um, I-I don't... [SIGHS] I don't like it. I wanna connect with my wife, you know, and...not a... you know, um... Not a what? I think all Palek is saying is that he misses you. Huh. I don't know why. I feel-- I felt very connected to him. I'd like to bring up something. I know you don't wanna pathologize the process of creating a child. No one does. But I think you might want to consider getting tested now. Starting the next part of the process. No, no, we've actually, uh, talked about that and we're not, uh-- We're not ready to go there, right? MAY: Well, I think it's worth considering. Well, it's not your decision. [SIGHS] These things do add up. Secrets and shame can do things to us that are very damaging and irreversible. I don't believe that. [LAUGHS] I think losing your legs-- I think that's irreversible. Well, I think we should tell people. I'm sick of it being such a big deal. [SIGHS] What? Every month is worse than the last, sweetie. It is. I'm not telling anyone. Um. Oh, I'm-- No, I'm sorry. Um. Is that your decision? I don't need tips from every woman and their aunt who's been through this. Come on. So I'm not. MAY: Might be helpful. I mean, other women and their aunts have gone through this. You're not alone. And I seriously doubt that the impact of it all is going to be as bad as you fear it is. Well, it's personal. It's private. I want to deal with it privately. Well, I'm not saying we should send out a mass email. I'm just...sick of feeling like there's something wrong with us, you know? [SIGHS] And I'm sick of having sex because we have to. I'm sorry, it sucks. And... [SIGHS] ...when I say that yesterday was strange, I'm-- I'm-- I'm done. [DOOR CLOSES] Excuse me. What are you doing? [GASPS] Hey, what is wrong with you? You were rude in there. Don't do that to me in there! I'm...just trying to...deal with us. By separating us? That's not what I'm doing. Yeah, it is. If you feel that way, tell me. Not her. Look, I'm trying to save us. From what? From what's happening to us. [SIGHS] What? Nothing. Tell me. I-- You're... What? Nothing. [SCOFFS] What? No! Come on. Oh, fuck. I already got tested last week. I fucking knew it! Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I was afraid. Afraid? Of what? Of what? What do you think? Of me? Of what? That there was something wrong with me. Is it that fucking hard to figure out? Jesus. John? This is May... ...returning your call. [SIGHING] Your calls. I, uh-- I was, um, going to send you an email or-- Or, uh, a note. But, um... I wanted you to hear my voice. I know you need to hear from people who care about you... ...now, and, uh-- And you know that I do, and I always will. And know too that time, um-- Well, time-- Time is able to diffuse even the most... ...intense feelings of...grief. And, um... ...of love. So, um, please, um... ...consider this call an expression of how much I care for you. And, uh, also an acknowledgement of how time has changed us. [SIGHS] [PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY] [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello? DAVE: Hey, what are you doing? What do you mean? I'm waiting to go into therapy. Oh... You excited? [WHISPERS] No, I'm not excited. I'm nervous. Why? [SIGHS] Because it's not easy. And you would know that if you were here. Oh, shoot. I gotta go. Wait. Hi. I gotta go. She's standing here looking at me. I gotta go. I love you. You love me? Yes. Tell me. I gotta go. Bye. [LAUGHS] Hi. Hi. So the last time you had sex, what was it like? [SIGHING] It was good. It was good. I mean, I told you, we always had really good sex. Nothing stands out? No, no... Well-- [CLEARS THROAT] It was...on our anniversary. Which was, um... [LAUGHS] ...almost a year ago. That's a long time, isn't it? Mm, that depends. [LAUGHS] On what? On what happened in the year. Yeah, well... ...it's a long time. Why was it the last time? Um... ...I don't know. [LAUGHS] Just...stopped. Tell me. Well, it just happened. I-- [LAUGHS] A-at first I don't even think that we noticed. You know, it was just-- Oh, there's kids, work, bills, sleep. You know? And then... ...when we did notice, it just-- It was just easier not to do it...than to do it. [LAUGHS] You know? You still kiss each other? Yeah. Yeah, of course. I mean, yeah. Good. So Dave still makes you feel sexual, makes you feel like you want sex? Very much. Yeah. But you're not able to. Uh, no. No. Hm. Many couples who don't have sex dread going to bed. They find those moments when they lie next to each other and they can't touch each other very lonely. Yeah. [WHISPERS] Yeah. [SIGHS] Has Dave asked, um... ...what we talk about? Yeah. And you told him? [LAUGHS] No. [LAUGHS] Oh. Well, why not? I don't know. I think I'm just, you know, punishing him for not coming here with me. So... Or maybe you like the feeling of being separate from him. Maybe it makes you feel a little stronger. A little less hopeless. Well, maybe. Uh-- Katie, We can't begin to dismantle that distance-- invade that space between you and Dave --until both of you recognize now that you are individual sexual beings. Not when you met, not before you had children, but now. Can you spend a little time this week thinking about that? Yeah, I'd like to spend some time not thinking about it. [SIGHING] Mason? Hey. Do you, um-- Do you still see that guy that owns the Italian restaurant? Well, did you fuck him over? Okay, could you ask him to send over something really special and delicious? Yeah. I don't know. Whatever he wants. No piccata. No veal. No white sauce. But...whatever he wants. Cool. [MAN AND WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [SIGHS] [LAUGHS] So why did you call me right before I want into therapy, but now you don't ask me anything about what happened? It's your thing. No it's not. It's our thing. [MUFFLED] No, it isn't. [SIGHS] That's why you bought me the car, isn't it? What? That's why you bought it now. You know I'm gonna do this with or without you, and that just freaks you out. [WHISPERING] Honey, that car has been falling apart for years. Oh, no. J-- See? This is what I was afraid of. Y-- You go in there and you start talking about us, and suddenly everything means something else. [WHISPERS] Because it does. [SIGHS] Oh. What? Nothing. [SIGHS] We're a mess, Dave. Face it. We love each other. I love you, but we are a mess. That's it. We're not getting the car. Like that's your decision to make. That's not your decision to make. [SIGHS] Um... Hi. Hi. Hi. MAN: How are you two today? Great. How are you? [LAUGHS] Good, thanks. Wonderful. So, uh... ...ready to buy a car? [LAUGHS] Yep. Yeah, great financing to offer. Come in, I'm ready. Okay. [LAUGHS] All right. Hm. Hey. [SIGHS] Sorry. Just like that? Hopefully. Well, Don't-- Don't eat all that-- Fine. I'm just looking. Huh. Hey. Wanna watch TV? Uh...I don't know. Hey. [WHISPERS] Hey. I said I was sorry. Oh. And I am. I should have told you. Yeah, you should have. Well, uh, yeah, I know. I said I'm sorry. I-- I know. It's good news though, right? Yeah, it is. [SIGHS] You want me to make it up to you? W-- Right now? [GASPS] Are you gonna think about it? No. Yeah. Wow. Mm-hm. You wanna see how sorry I am? Kinda. [LAUGHS] You want me to show you? Yeah. Yeah? I wanna see...if you're just a little bit sorry. Me? Yeah, 'cause I think you should be sorry too. Oh, really? [LAUGHS] I do. I'm starting to become sorry. You are? Yeah. [BOTH GASPING AND GRUNTING] Ow. [SIGHS] [WATER RUNNING] [SIGHS] You know, they're, uh, thinking about raising the age of five-pitch to eight. Oh, really? You know, I think that's a good idea. I think it's too competitive for seven-year-olds. Yeah, uh, I think they should really enforce the no-parents-in-the-dugout rule. You know what? That's a good idea too. [SIGHS] Brilliant. [GRUNTS] Oh, God. [SIGHS] Night. [GRUNTS] Oh. Night, sweetie. [BOTH SIGH] [WHISPERS] Blanket. You want the light out? Uh, not-- Not if you wanna read, no. Okay. [SIGHING] I can definitely fall asleep with it on. Yeah, I know. I know. I was asleep before I even hit the bed. Yeah, me too. [SIGHS] [GRUNTS] [SIGHING] I don't care what you talk about. I just don't wanna be blamed. I don't blame you, Dave. I don't. I know that you're freaking out, thinking we're in there talking about you all the time. But that's-- That-- That's not what it is. It's-- It's more about me. What about you? Well, I don't know. I mean, it's, uh-- She says that I have to remember who I was as a sexual being before-- You know, before everything. Before we got married. Everything. I don't know. Ha-ha. [LAUGHS] And I can't even remember yesterday. I know. Mm... Good night. Good night. [SNIFFS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] Hey, what if it is me? Um, what if, uh, I go and we find out it's--? It's me? That I'm the problem? It won't be you. No, but what--? What if it is? What--? What happens then? Uh, I don't know. We'll figure it out. You haven't thought about it? You...think of everything beforehand. No. I haven't really thought about it. Hm. You...got tested without me. I mean, it's like you-- You, uh-- Wanted to get your ammo ready or something. Oh, come on. That's not true. Well, then w-why'd you do it? I mean, you told me you were getting a massage. Babe, why are you d--? Why? So, uh-- We-- I said I was sorry. Why are you picking a fight now? I don't know. Why do I feel like part of you wants it to be me? That's crazy. So what if it is...me? Then...what do we do? We'll figure it out. Okay, why won't you answer me? This is such a stupid conversation. This is pure conjecture. We should wait-- Conjecture? Yeah. Oh. Conjecture. We should wait until we have the information-- Oh, okay. All right. Then we can make a decision. MAN: It goes with the rest of the marinade. MAN: Okay. I got those shallots chopped and ready to go. MAN: You don't want us to, uh... Usually the mango salsa is right there. Is Amir coming in? [TELEPHONE RINGING] MAN: Gonna be late. MAN: Oh, all right. Mom. What? I-I-I don't know. I don't know. [SIGHS] Wha--? I-I don't know. W-- Can you just do whatever you want? Yes, you can, Mom. You can make a decision without me. And you can make a decision without him too. Why? Because we're not getting married. Yeah, I mean it. [SIGHS] I don't care what you tell them. You know, I-- I d-- I don't-- I don't give a shit how they feel. I don't. I mean, honestly, how about how I feel? You know what? Mom, I can't. Have the fucking wedding, okay? 'Cause I don't give a shit.
