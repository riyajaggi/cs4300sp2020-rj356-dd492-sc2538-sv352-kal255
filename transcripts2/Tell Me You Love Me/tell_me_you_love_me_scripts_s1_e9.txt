 Are you really that surprised? Well, yeah, I mean-- Yeah, I'm-I'm honestly-- I'm more than surprised. I'm sort of shocked. I mean-- Yeah. Katie, when was the last time you saw me really happy? Well, I don't know. You know? Nobody's happy all the time, right? I mean, it sort of, you know, comes and it goes and... Rita, have you hormones checked? Because I know that sounds crazy

 but women have killed their own children in hormonal rages. You know, maybe that's a part of this. Katie, listen. There's nothing wrong with me. Just like there is nothing wrong with you. You're in the same situation. It may be your version of it, but-- No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I would-- I would never leave Dave. I've never wanted to leave Dave and, you know, he doesn't wanna leave me, so... You haven't had sex in a year. Well, so what? So what?

 I mean, we love each other. You know? If-if-if his legs fell off I wouldn't leave him. What does that mean? It means, sex isn't everything, you know? No, it isn't. It's only a part of it. I know that. So fix the other parts, Rita. I mean, come on. I can't. I tried. And now I just don't want to. I'm just trying to get out of what we have been complaining about to each other for the last 10 years. Yeah, I, uh... I just don't remember complaining though, you know? It was fun. I mean, I just, I th-- You know, we were complaining so that this wouldn't happen. Right? I mean... Do you remember a couple years ago when Dan and I were thinking about having another kid? Well, if we did, right now that kid would be 3 years old. I wouldn't be able to leave. It would've been the worst mistake ever. Okay, Rita. You know what? I'm not you. All right, Rita? You don't need to warn me. And you know what I think? I think that you are making a huge mistake right now. I think you are about to destroy your life, and you're gonna come to me in a year from now and you're gonna ask me why I let you do this. Jesus Christ, Katie. You'd think I'm leaving you. No, come on. I understand what you're talking about-- No, you don't. No, you don't. I thought you would, but you don't. There's the yolk sac, and... there's the heartbeat. Oh, my God. Wow, it-- It has a long way to go. [WOMEN LAUGH] It does. But it happens fast. Uh, how fast? Well, by your next ultrasound you'll see the beginnings of arms, and legs, and the heart, and before you know it, it will be keeping you up at night. [LAUGHS] It's pretty incredible. That's why they call it the miracle of life. Do you guys want a picture? Start showing off? No, that's all right. Uh, yeah. Yeah, we do. Yes. Definitely. Okay. [BEEPING, WHIRRING] There you go. I'll see you both in six weeks. Okay. Okay, thank you. [DOOR CLOSES] That's unbelievable, that that, uh... will be us one day. It's okay. It's okay. No one expects you to fall in love with a grain of rice. Hon, just give it some time. Oh, give it time. Oh, okay. Come on. No, I know. Um, okay. I just-- I mean, you know. I know. We'll get through this together. Okay. I'll get us through it. [PHONE RINGS] Hi. NICK [ON PHONE]: Hey, babe. How ya doin'? Good. How you doin'? Good. Just tryin' to figure out my night. Did you get my text? Um, yeah. I'm sorry, I got busy. So we're still meeting up? Um, well, I already ate but I'll meet up with you afterward. All right. All right, well, I'm gonna go out so I'll just meet you back at your place. I love you. Anyway... Um, I'll see you later. Okay. Bye. [ENGINE TURNS OFF] What? [MURMURS] [SIGHS] I'm just not ready to tell her. I don't think we should. I-I think it's too early. She's your mother, Palek. Since when do you give a shit about my mother? Since she became our baby's grandmother. [SIGHS] I just don't want her fuckin' drama. I don't wanna deal with her hugging, kissing bullshit. We'll throw it in the middle of one of her stories. She'll barely notice. Hon, she'll notice. Look, if I had a mother, I'd want her to know, even if I hated her. Don't pull the dead-mother card. It's not fair. I-I'm just saying, I would want to tell her. Just like I wanna tell your mother. I just wanna tell family. All right, all right, all right. Are you okay? Yeah. And I wanted to tell her that she was out of line but I didn't feel that I could. We've known each other for so many years and it just seemed inappropriate and rude, to tell her what I really felt. Th-there's rudeness attached to this movement that seems to be going around. People tell each other, you know, what they want and feel and need. Don't-don't you think? Uh... Yeah. Um, we're pregnant. So... Uh... Oh, my God. What? What? Oh. Why say it like that? Why? Why not? Oh, my God. [LAUGHING]: Oh, my God. Oh, oh, there it is. Okay. Oh. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, Carolyn, I don't know what to say. I love you. Oh, well. I love you. [BOTH LAUGH] God, could the, um...? Uh, I'll be right back. What is it with you and the heat in this place, Mom? LAUREN: Well, uh, I'm cold. Oh, Carolyn, I can-- I can finally tell you. Now, I did my very best not to say anything. Lauren. Not to-- Palek's not happy. And I don't know what to do. Oh, he's... Well, he's-he's happy. No. He isn't? He doesn't want this baby. He doesn't wanna be a dad. [WHISPERING]: Did-did he tell you this? Well, he-he doesn't have a choice, does he? No. He'll come around. Oh, sweetheart, it's wonderful news. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe Isabella can read to Josh. We could pay her. Dave? Yeah. JOSH [WHINING]: I wanna watch my show. How was your day? Oh, you know. Good. Same as it was yesterday. How was your day? It was good. And, um, I got a lot of stuff done. Went over to Rita's for a while, hung out. Yeah? How's she doin'? How's she doin'? She's, um... She's good. Have you talked to Dan lately? Well, you guys don't really talk very much, do you? No. Only when you girls are together. Yeah, well... Well, Rita was telling me how, a few years ago, Dan wanted to have another baby but she didn't want to. She's smart. Yeah, well. I think that your reasons for not wanting to have a baby and her reasons are probably different though, you know? ISABELLA: I'm tryin' to watch this. What are you reasons, Dave? Uh... I don't know. I-- I mean, you-- Honey, you don't really want a baby, do you? That's not what I'm asking. You know, I just-- I would like to know what your reasons are. It's-it's-it's not that I don't want one, I just, I just, you know-- We're gettin' old. Not really. I mean, there was that woman in the Philippines. What was she? Like, she was 62 and she had a kid? W-what am I supposed to say to that? I mean-- Look, I-I-I don't know what's goin' on here but I feel like there's this weird trap and I'm afraid to take a step 'cause my foot's gonna get cut off. You know what? Maybe that's the problem. You know that? Maybe we're just-- We're just afraid. I don't know. I don't know. We can't redo the patio every year. Yeah, well, I-I-I never wanted to redo it. You're the one who wants to redo it. I-I'm fine with the way it is. I always have been. Yeah, exactly. So how have you been? Good. Have you talked to Hugo since our session? Uh, he'll never talk to me again. How's it going with Nick? Fine. We had shitty sex, and then we had good sex, and then he told me he loved me. And, um... And, um, what? [SIGHS] Now, every time we leave each other, he says, "I love you." When Nick tells you he loves you, what do you say? [CHUCKLES] Um, I kiss him, and then change the subject. [LAUGHS] Well, that's a tried and true method. Yeah, but not for me. I mean, usually when a guy tells me he loves me-- Which happens a lot. --I just say it right back even if it's not true, you know? Just seeing it in their face, and... feeling all that stuff, you just feel is worth it. And then what happens? I usually fuck around on them, try to figure out a way to leave them, usually blame them for something, and then get into another relationship. But this time you said was different. This time you said you weren't doing that. Tell me why you think you weren't doing it. I don't know. I mean, I can't tell him I love him back. I don't want to. And I wish that I could because it would just make it a lot easier to lie about it. You know, he's not upset, I'm not upset. There's not that, you know, weird moment or that awkward space that just kinda sits there wherein I'm not saying I don't love you. I don't think that's a bad thing. Yeah, well, it makes me feel shitty. I mean, what if he's the guy, you know? What if I'm so fucked up that the right guy is standing right in front of me and I can't say it? And what if I can only say it to the wrong people? Well, I don't think that's the case. I think you're examining some very valid issues. You know, I've spent so long in relationships that I don't know... It's like, I have no lines, no boundaries. And it never used to bother me before and now it drives me crazy. Now I wanna run. But I'm afraid to run because I'm afraid to be alone, so I stay. Only now, I'm like this blob who can really fuck, and there's no-- There's nothing. Well, the obvious answer is of course to spend some time, a decent amount of time, alone. Changing who you're with obviously doesn't work. Unless you change, the issues will remain the same. You know, part of me just wants to run off an marry him. I mean, he's a great guy. So what am I doing? Jaime, if you really find it difficult to be alone it seems to me you have few choices. One. You can tell him you love him, see what happens. Or you can keep on kissing him and changing the subject, which doesn't come without its own challenges but you seem to be up to it. Or you can tell him the truth. You can tell him how you feel, that you need some time. [BEEPING] WOMAN [ON PHONE]: Hello? Uh, yes. I'm calling about the job for the digital artist. Do you have experience? Uh, yes I did. I mean, I do. Mm-hm. How much, about? Well, it was-- It was a few years go, but-- Do you have a portfolio? Yeah, I have. References? Uh, both. Could you come in tomorrow? Tomorrow? About 2:00? Sure, I can. Great. E-mail your résumé and I'll see you then. Yeah. Okay, I'll see you then. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Bye. Thank you. The client is not happy, and I can't say I blame them. Hinton was a dropped ball, and I would never say this to them, but that was a fuckup. And that was our fuckup because due diligence wasn't. Carolyn, I want you to go back over all the documents. All four contracts. Go over it with a fine-toothed comb, make sure we're protected. And then, tomorrow you'll review it with Philip. What? I need more time. You don't have more time. I need it tomorrow. Then get somebody else. Yeah. [SCOFFS] I don't know what to tell you about the cement. We're gonna do what we need to do. Okay? Hey. I don't have any more time, okay? That's it. I-- [PHONE BEEPS] Okay, I gotta call you back. Hey. CAROLYN [ON PHONE]: Hey. How are you? Uh, fine. Where are you? Uh, at work. W-what's up? Well, I-- I think I just quit. What? Yeah. I just walked out. Well, are you gonna walk back in? No. No, I'm not. Um... We're doing fine. And you know how I feel, I don't wanna work once the baby's born, so... I think I'm done. You're done? Yeah. Palek, you know, honestly, I don't think I could go back in there. I mean, I-- Shoulter has probably cleaned out my office. I mean, I just walked out on her. Okay. Well, you know, I gotta go, and, uh, maybe we can talk about this later. Okay. Bye. Bye. How are you today? Oh, um, I'm fine, thank you. Could I get a room started for you? Uh, no thanks. I think I'm just gonna keep looking. Okay. Thanks. Hi, it's Katie Walker and I'm sorry this is so last minute but we're not gonna make therapy today, it's just-- It's been a crazy day and so I'll just, um-- I'll just-- I'll-I'll talk to you soon. Okay. I'm-I'm sorry about that. Okay, bye-bye. [PHONE CHIMES] Dave? Oh. Oh, hey. Uh, uh, Katie's not here yet. No, I just got a message from Katie, cancelling therapy. Yeah, I-- I must've just missed her call. Well, you're here. We have the hour and it's already paid for. Why don't you come in? Yeah. Sally, you're doin' pickup, right? Do you think you could get Isabella and Josh? SALLY [ON PHONE]: Sure. Everything okay? Yeah, I just got tied up. I'll have Dave come and get him before dinner, okay? Okay. Rita called. She said you guys got in a fight. She's really upset. Well, so am I. Why? You know what? Let's just talk about it later, okay Sally? Thanks for gettin' the kids. So... I, um-- I, uh-- I-I don't-- What am I doin' here? [LAUGHS] Dave, a few minutes ago you made choice. I think it was a good one. You chose to stay. I imagine there's a reason why. There are a number of ways I can get you to talk. Are they all painful? Yes, most of them. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Mm. Katie wants another baby. Do you? No. Why not? Too old. And to tell you the truth, as-as much as I love my kids, I wouldn't mind having my wife back. So you miss her? Every day. Many couples come to me because they think they've, um, grown distant. Yeah. Yeah, we really have. Well, I think it's just the opposite. Sometimes, there's no passion left when, when the space is so small you can't reach across it. But all there is, is space. There-there is so much space, I can't-- I-I don't even know how to get to her. I don't know how to get to her. I... I don't even know where she is. [SIGHS] What about you? Tell me where you've been. I didn't go anywhere. I, I just-- I mean, life-- Things... changed. Some of these guys I sell steel to, they-- They're builders. They're young, no kids. I always wanted to build things. And I look at them and then I think, "Why isn't that me?" "Why am I who I am?" And then I go home, and then there's Katie. And I love her, I-I-- I never even knew what love was until I met Katie, but sometimes I hate her. I know that's wrong. I know I shouldn't blame her. But I do. And you still think we're too close? I think all of your resentment, your disappointment and your regret, is all mixed up with Katie's. That's a difficult knot to untangle. Yeah. It's more than that. It's... like something came in one day, and took it. One night I looked over and I didn't want her. And I didn't know why. And I didn't know what to do. Hm. You know, that's something you should share with Katie. You can't tell your wife you don't want her anymore, and recover. No, but you can tell her that you're lost and you don't know what to do. Does it come back? I mean, does it? Once you've gotten to the point where we are? Can it come back? Can we reverse time? No. But sometimes there can be something else. And sometimes that something else can be better. What? [SIGHS] Something better. [CUSTOMERS CHATTERING] Love Crush. I'm sorry? Th's what it's called. Oh. It's pretty silly, huh? Yeah. You know, it would look good on you though. Oh. Would you like to see? Oh, , oh, no. No, that's okay. Oh, sit. Sit down. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, this looks good. You know, I'm gonna grab some shadow. Sure, okay. Okay. [CLEARS THROAT] Close? Mm-hm. [BOTH GIGGLE] Other eye. Uh, okay. Well, so we had the, uh, the first inspector out to the house, the guy that you suggested. Kurt. Yeah, Kurt's a good guy. Well, he was tryin' to put a happy face on, but, uh, I could tell there was something he wasn't saying. Uh-huh. So I had another inspector come out to the house. Yeah, this guy Mike. Former Marine. Tells it like it is. Mold. Mold? It's everywhere. It's, uh-- It's all over your house. Wait. No it's not. We never saw any mold. No, of course you didn't see it. That's the whole thing, it's mold. It's the silent killer. All right. I'm still gonna buy it. Clean up's gonna cost at least 50,000. Sure, of course. Maybe more. I... So... It's your choice. [SIGHS] You all right? Am I all right? What is that? Some kind of trick question? What is that? You look pale. I'm fine. Jesus. [MUTTERING] Fuckin' shit. Fuck. Fuck. [GROANING] Oh, fuck. So where is Mom anyway? Uh, on her way, honey. She-she called and she's on her way. She gained like 400 pounds and then blew up in the parking lot. When's she gonna get here? Huh? Um, soon. Soon. [DOOR CLOSES] KATIE: Hey. See? Hey, what happened? Uh, I just, um-- I lost track of time. Hey, Mom. Hey, sweetie. Hey, you look pretty. Thank you. And-and this morning, I mean, what happened with therapy? Well, I, uh-- I got busy, you know? I thought-- I thought you would be relieved. Uh, I-I would've been if I had gotten a message sooner. Oh, so you went? How was it? It was, uh-- It-it was irritating. You want some chicken? Sure, okay. So how was everybody's day? Fine. Good day. Did you go to--? Thanks. Did you go to baseball today? Yeah. Hey. Hi. You know what? What? I think we're moving too fast. [SCOFFS] Look, I wanna be with you. I just-- I mean, it's not us, I just wanna slow down. Right. I went to the shrink and-and I'm just trying to deal with my shit and I'm trying to do something right for a change. Mm-hm. I'm tired of this shit. Maybe we should just talk about this later. There's nothing to-- There's nothing to talk about. I'm falling in love with you and you're not falling in love with me. But I am in love with you. No, you're not. I want to be. You're everything that I want. Oh, fuck you. [DOOR CLOSES] I had a session with a patient. A man, 40 years old. He'd never been there alone. He always comes with his wife. And he's not comfortable in therapy. And for the first time in a long time, I wasn't comfortable either. He... I was stumped by something he asked me. I can't imagine you stumped about anything. Unless it's about building a house. It was about marriage and I think I let him down. Really? Mm-hm. How? He and his wife have been struggling. And I told him to stick it out, that there was something at the other end of it. And then when he asked me what it was, I c-- I didn't know what to tell him. Tell him it's the same thing he has now, only he loves it. He wouldn't change a thing about it. How can I explain that to him? You can't. You didn't fail him. He just can't grasp what we have from his point of view. Hm. NICK [ON PHONE]: Hey, Jaime, it's Nick. Um, I left some softball stuff over there, and, uh, a pair of shoes, I think. So if you could leave 'em by your door I'll grab 'em some time tomorrow. Um, I think you're right. I think we need a break. Well, I mean, I-I know I need to. So take care. So what did you do all day? Can you just give me the run down? Uh, just-- You know, I was running errands. All day? No, I was-- I went shopping. You know, it's-- It's not like I disappeared, like I hopped a plane to Vegas. I just-- I, um... [SIGHS] I had an interview and I didn't have anything to wear so I went to the mall. What do you mean, you had an interview? What-what kind? For what? For a job, Dave. [LAUGHS] What? [LAUGHING] Why are you laughing? It's just-- This is a job job? Yeah. Full-time? Yeah, full-time. [LAUGHS] Why is this so funny? No, it's funny because it's-it's-- It's not like, hah-hah funny. It's more like, funny hah-hah. I mean... You know, first you want a baby and now you want a job. You want to go to therapy, you don't want to go. You don't answer your phone, your eyelids are blue. You noticed. Well, of course. Who wouldn't notice? I mean, you wanted to get a pass for the day? Fine. Who doesn't wanna get a pass for the day? I do, but I busted my butt to get to that appointment. I left work early to pick up the kids, I looked like an idiot because I didn't know where you were. You don't even tell me about Rita and Dan, I have to hear it from Sally. I mean, come on. [SIGHS] I'm sorry, I should've told you. Why didn't you? Because, because-- Because it's Rita and Dan. It's Rita and Dan, Dave. Okay? She can do that, I mean, if-if-- If they can do that then, I don't know, anyone can do it. And I just, I-- You know, it just threw me, okay? I just-- I'm confused right now, and I just-- Well, me fucking too. Don't swear, okay? Let's not do that. Let's just... Tell me what to do, Katie. I've done everything you asked me to do. So tell me what to do now. I don't know. We're fine, Dave. No. No, no, no. We'll be fine. Yeah, yeah. [CLATTERING IN DRAWER] [SLAMMING DRAWER] Stop doing that. Okay. Just-just make it-- Just calm down. You know what I was gonna tell you tonight? That I changed my mind. What? I think we should have a baby. What? I'm just-- I'm saying you were right. No, I wasn't. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay, I'm beat. I'm goin' to bed. I had a panic attack? You'll be fine, just take it easy. I thought I was dying. You know, I'm not a hypochondriac or anything. I've never even been to an emergency room. No, babe, they ran the tests. I mean, you're fine. It's a physical thing. You know, it's just like a physical thing in your head. I guess. [SIGHS] I can't believe I quit my job. Wow. What? It is always about you, isn't it, Carolyn? Good job gettin' us through this. You know what, Palek? Grow up. Okay? You're gonna be a father, 'cause we're having a baby. He said to reduce my stress level. Do you think that is reducing my stress level? Okay. Okay? Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I got scared. I never get scared-- This was really scary. [MUTTERING] ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: Local law enforcement officers recommend the Cobra StunLight. Lost you keys? Find them easily. A stranger approaches? Beware. It's a light, it's a stun gun. The perfect utility for all your security needs. And if you act now, we will include, free of charge, a DC car charge-- [GROANS] ...just sitting there. I mean, like, fuck. What do you expect him to do? I don't ca-- I don't-- You know, I don't care. I don't care. Whatever. [LAUGHING]: You so fuckin' care. I don't. I mean, what kind of a name is Anya, anyway? I don't know. Who cares? Sounds like a industrial cleaner. [BOTH LAUGH] Fuck, I don't know, man. I don't know. He kinda looks like a girl, anyway. What? I don't know. What? [SPUTTERING]: How do I make you feel better about it? Um, y-you-- We drink. Right. That's what I do, is Iet you hammered. That's what you do. You know, I don't-- That's what I do, I pay for the alcohol. Have we not established this? This is how I roll. [WHISPERING]: I roll big. I roll big. We'll do this, okay? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh. Wow. Wow. Awesome. You. You wanna, um, go out? MAN: Yeah. Pick the place. Do you have a, um, number? MAN: Got a pen? A pen? How old are you, man? I got this phone. [DOG BARKING] [CLEARS THROAT] [DIALING] [PHONE RINGS] Hello. Hey. Morning. What happened? What do you mean, what happened? I took the kids to school. Well, why didn't you wake me? You were out. I figured, let you sleep. Well, what'd you tell the kids? You were tired. What'd they say? They didn't say anything. Good. Well, um, I'm sorry you had to do the morning alone. It's okay. It's fine. Yeah, it sounds like it. [SIGHS] Katie, you oversleeping is the least of our problems. Bye. Bye. A panic attack? Yeah. It was scary. Have you had one before? No, why? Am I gonna have another one? Probably not, but a panic attack is a warning sign. It's the body's alarm system going off. That's a good description. Anyway, it's over now, so... Good. I quit my job. Oh. Yeah, the day of his attack. That's not why I had it. No, I'm not saying that's why you had it. I'm just saying, the day I quit my job, when I needed you, you had a panic attack. Yeah, I did. Well, that's fucking scary. We're pregnant, I don't have a job, and you're disappearing in front of my eyes. You quit your job without even telling me. It's, uh, the first time in my life I depend on someone, and now I find I can't. And that's, just hard. I'm sorry, have I not been clear? I mean, you know how I feel about all this. Yeah, I do. Okay. Carolyn, how does he feel? [SIGHS] Scared? Look, I w-- I wanna get us back to where we were, you know? I-I know that I may have been too focused on getting pregnant, and maybe I stopped listening but I'm here now and I want to now, so... Good. You lost faith that you were gonna get pregnant. I lost faith that we should. Yeah, I want to be a good husband, I can be a good husband, but... I don't think I can be a good husband and a father. I-I, uh-- I don't have it in me. What do you need me to do? I've said I'll wait, I've said I'll stay, I've said-- Whato you need from me? What do you need me to do? Um... I think it might be too late f-- I think we should spit up. Why? I'm not happy. [*] I haven't been for a long time.
