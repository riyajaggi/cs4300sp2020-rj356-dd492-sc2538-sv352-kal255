 [ coughs ] Hey, sweetie. How you feeling? Yuck. Well, I made you a sandwich. Oh, I can't eat. But thank you so much for letting me stay here. You know, I live alone. I know. I got nobody. Ha ha. I know. If I died,

 it'd be two, three weeks before somebody started smelling me. I don't want that. Nobody wants that. But you know something? It's good that I'm here for you, too. Why is that? 'Cause I can help keep your mind off Rick. Remember? 'Cause you still love him, and he's getting married today. Is that today? Hmm. Aw, look at you, all trying to cover up your pain. I'm so sorry, you know? It must be killing you. Wow, look at that -- you took my mind right off of it. Oh, good.

 I'm going! I'm going! I'm going to Paris! - You got the internship? - I got the internship! Paris loves Holly! Holly je suis happy. Oh, my God. You did it! You did it! [ both shrieking ] Yay, I know. Okay, I may blow chunks. Okay. Okay, when do you leave? - A week. - A week? That's it? I only have my baby sister for one more week, and then she graduates and leaves me forever? I'm not dying. But I am. Okay, we -- we have to go get your tickets, your passport, and we're going to get you some new clothes. Oh, I'm so excited for you! Don't leave me alone up here!

Do you understand me? The famous one in Paris. That's great. I'm unbelievably excited for you. Yeah, me too. Unbelievably excited. Seriously, it is so great. Yeah, seriously, the greatest. Give me back my letter. You're bumming me out. Well, I'm sorry, but you're going to be gone, like, the whole summer. I mean, my mom's always telling me that your life doesn't revolve around Holly Tyler, but it does. It so does. Yeah, she's nothing without you. Okay, and what are you going to be doing while she's gone? Well, unlike you, I am my own person. I don't rely on one individual to make my life complete. Mm-hmm. Then how come you cried when you read the letter? Tears of joy, girl. Tears of joy. [ groans ] So when do you have to be in freakin' Paris? Well, officially, not until next week, but Val got a really great deal on tickets if I leave in three days. Three days? Well, I thought we were going to go bowling next week. Henry! Henry! Look! Yes! I knew it! Wait there! You see that, downers? That is how an actual person gets excited for another actual person with good news. I'm not hanging out with you this summer. I'm not hanging out with you, either. Want to go bowling next week? Sure. - You're going to Paris! - I'm so going to Paris! [ both laughing ] If you hadn't helped me with that essay... - We kissed. - I know. What was that? - It just happened. - How did that happen? You have Kate. Not anymore. We broke up. [ gasps ] Oh, God. Is it 'cause she found out about this? Um... when do you leave? Three days. Three days. So what does this mean? It means you're going to Paris, and you're going to have a great summer, and we'll figure it out when you get back. - Want to kiss again? - Uh-huh. Oh, what are you doing? I ran out of juice. Why are you lying here? I ran out of gas. All right, get back in bed, and I will go get you some more juice. No, no, wait, don't leave. I have to talk to you about something. Okay, well, get back in bed first. Come on. Do you know how much I love you? Mm-hmm. I know how much codeine was in that cough medicine. Oh, no, I love you more. All right. Look, I don't want to scare you, but I think this is more serious than we thought. I think I have the bird flu. Lauren -- No, no, okay, this is serious, all right? Please, just listen to me here. If something should happen to me, I need you to go to my apartment. In my nightstand, second drawer, in the very, very back on the way right under my personal "Lauren" stationery, there is a long box. I need you to get it out of the house immediately upon my death. Oh, God. No, no, no, look, okay, you would be saving my family from a great deal of embarrassment. Also, I'd like to be buried with it. Lauren -- No, please? Okay, okay, whatever you want, but if you don't die, do you think you can get better in three days? I don't know. Do you need me to do some work? [ coughs ] No, it's just that I'm not going to be here in three days. Oh, my God. What do you have? Do you think it's monkeypox? Do you need me to get rid of anything in your nightstand? God, no, no. And don't go snooping around in there, either. Listen, when I was at the travel agency earlier with Holly, I looked up, and I saw a poster of Venice. Venice! I have wanted to go there my whole life. So I figure with Holly leaving and the whole Rick getting married thing, it's the perfect thing to do. Oh, so you're going to Venice. Yeah. âª I'm going to Venice âª Oh. Well, that's great, you know? I'm really happy for you. Wait -- where are you going? To pack my things. Mm-hmm. There's a hospice two blocks down from my apartment. Maybe they're staying on the mainland and will have time to take care of me. Bummer. If you go there, who am I going to give this extra ticket to? What? The airfares were so cheap, I thought it would be fun to bring a friend. Oh, my God. I'm going to Venice. Oh, thank you! Thank you so much. You are the most thoughtful, generous, most giving person I have ever known. Coach? [ knock on door ] Hey, Vince. - Hey. That's for you. - Thanks. - Sign here. - Okay. - Is, uh, Holly around? - No. Why? 'Cause whenever she's here, she always offers me a soda... and a sandwich. Help yourself. Thanks. Oh. Rick's wedding invitation. Yeah, I was just cleaning up, and I found that. I was going to throw it out, but then you came along and ruined everything. He's getting married today, huh? - Mm-hmm. - Sorry. Nothing to be sorry about. Julie is a great gal. Rick is very happy. I wish them both well. So you have no problem with it. Not a one. Then why did you cross off Julie's name and write yours? Lauren did that. She thought it would be funny. I did not care for it. You do know there's, like, a million other guys out there who would totally want to hook up with you. Thanks. But why can't it be him? We are so good together. I mean, we could stay up all night talking and never run out of stuff to say. We laugh at the same things. I would be thinking about him, and then he would call. I mean, except for the whole fiancée thing, it was a fairy tale. You know what you should do? You should tear that up and throw it away. You know what? You are exactly right. That is exactly what I am going to do. Ahem. Hmm. Do you want me to do it? No, unh-unh. I need to do it. You know what? That felt really good. Yeah, really good. You helped me. Well, you gave me a soda. The least I can do is change your life. So what'd you get from the travel agency? Oh, it's my tourist packet. I'm going to Venice. Venice? That's great. When are you going? Oh, in three days. I was with Holly getting her tickets, and I -- What tickets? Oh, haven't you heard? Holly got accepted to her internship. She's going to Paris? Yeah, we both leave in three days. How long is she going to be gone? The whole summer. The whole summer? Yeah. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm great. I'm just really happy for her. Hey. What are you doing here? Uh, dropping off a package. Val told me about your internship. That's fantastic. I'm so happy for you. Thanks. I'm pretty happy myself. A whole summer in Paris -- that's... awesome. [ Lauren ]: Need Va-a-a-a-a-al! Yeah, it was a real good idea letting her stay here. Okay, well, uh, thanks for the whole envelope ripping thing. What was that about? Nothing. I just gave her some excellent advice. So the whole summer, huh? Yeah, the whole summer. It's going to be kind of weird not having you around. I kind of -- I'm sure you'll do fine. Well, you just, you know, you get used to seeing a person every day and talking to them and stuff, and then when they're not there -- Because they're going to Paris? Yeah. Paris -- the whole summer. I guess what I'm trying to say is... I'm just really going to... Going to what? What are you doing? Same thing you were doing. But why are you doing it? What is wrong with you? It seemed like you kind of liked it. Where would you get that idea? You know, you can't just go around kissing people. No, look, I know what you're worried about, but you don't have to worry about that anymore. Holly... I'm ready! For what? For, you know, for you and me to be together. [ gasps ] Lord, did you hear that? Vince is ready. Look, the heavens have opened, my prayers have been answered. Thank you, thank you, Lord. Why are you doing that? You're kind of hurting my feelings. Do you hear yourself? You're ready? You think that I have just been sitting around here waiting for you to be ready? This is what you wanted. I mean, this is what I want. - Since when? - Since now. Okay, what'd you do last night? Went out with a... friend of mine. Does this friend pee sitting down? What difference does it make who I went out with last night? I'm telling you now that I'm -- Now that I'm going to Paris for the summer. Holly, I'm ready to make a commitment. Oh, are you? Okay, then tell me this -- if you hadn't found out I was going to Paris for the summer, would you still feel this way right now? Liar. You know, it's easy for a person to make a commitment when the other person is going out of the country. Look, you can believe whatever you want, but I know how I feel, and I'm telling you, I'm ready to make a commitment. Well, it's too late. I am going to Paris, where the men are known for commitment. You know what? Forget it. Go to Paris. Have a nice trip. I will! And you have a nice summer. I will! And just so you know, the friend I went out with last night does pee sitting down, but she can also pee standing up, so ha! Ooh, Lauren, look, they're going to have two festivals while we're in Venice. Ooh, bellissimo. I'm excitedissimo. Sounds fun -- the Festa della sensa. We are going to have a total blastiola. Okay, would you stop doing that? Just because you put an "issimo" or "iola" at the end of the word doesn't make it Italian. Ooh, well, where did that come from? Someone still a little uptight over the wedding of Rickaroni? - Vince just kissed me! - What? Yeah, he said he's ready to commit to a relationship. Well, that's great. Yeah, you'd think, but it's just because I'm leaving. As soon as he knows he can't have something, he wants it. He's sick, and I hate him. Wait, so he just grabbed you and kissed you? Yeah. It was awesome. It was awesome? Wait, does this mean you guys are... No. And besides, I have a situation with Henry. - What? - What? - Oh, yeah. About a half-hour ago, he laid one on me, too. I must be looking good. Well, how was that one? So sweet and so nice. Wait a second. Doesn't Henry have a girlfriend? Not anymore. It's just -- he's so frustrating. I mean, he had months to do this. Henry? No, Vince. But I feel so comfortable with him. Vince? No, Henry. But when he kissed me... Henry. Okay, but what about Vince's kiss? You said that was awesome. When did I say that? Why'd he have to do it now? [ moans ] Vince or Henry? Doesn't matter. I'm going to see if I can get her on a plane in 10 minutes. Come on, hurry up, hurry up. I got a cab waiting downstairs. Hey, will you help me with this, please? Thank you. Ow! Thanks. All right, do you have your tickets? In my purse. - Your passport? - In my purse. - Your purse? - Don't know. Holly? What are you doing out of bed? She forgot her tickets, her passport, and her purse all on my bed. I swear, if your head weren't screwed -- Oh, no, too weak to continue. Look how sick you are. You're not going to the airport. Are you crazy? Lauren, help me up. I'm going to go to the airport. I want to say goodbye to my sister. We said goodbye 12 times. You can't go to the airport. You can't even stand up. They got wheelchairs. I've seen them. You can't go. No, it's okay. There's a reason that you and I aren't going to Venice today. I don't know what it is, but there is a reason. I know what it is -- you. You sneezed all over me. Now I'm not going to get to go to the Festival della sensa or the Vogalonga. But you can go next month, and they'll have even better festivals then. Oh, it doesn't get any better than the Vogalonga. But when you come, you can visit me. I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you more. No, no, I don't want to get you sick. I don't care. Hug me. I love you. I love you. I'll call you from the plane. Oh, Lauren... What? Come closer. Okay. Ah-choo! Thank you. [ Man ]: Attention, passengers, this is your final boarding call for Flight 77 to Paris. Hey, well, I guess I really have to go now. I'm going to miss you so much. I'm going to miss you, too. Hey, do me a favor -- take care of Gary for me, okay? - No. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. All right. Take care. Hey, do me a favor -- be nice to Tina. - No. - Okay. Aw, I can't believe you're going. - Don't cry. - I can't help it. I'm going to miss you so much. Oh, I'm going to miss you. - I love you. - I love you. More than Val? Lauren. It's okay. It's going to be our little secret, right? I'm, uh... I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you, too. Mm. Hey, listen, uh, I've been thinking, and you can totally say no to this, but what would you think about me coming to spend a week with you in Paris? I would love that. Final boarding call for Flight 77 to Paris. Okay, well, I got to go. I love you all. - Love you, too. - Bon voyage, Holly. Bon voyage. Bye. Bye. So that thing yesterday with our faces all up next to each other and our lips kind of touching... You mean the kiss? Whatever. I hope you enjoyed it, 'cause it's not going to happen again. Good. Unless it does. Val, I'm going to get off the phone so you can go back upstairs, go to bed, and get healthy so you can come visit me. No, no, I don't want to get off the phone yet. Me neither. Okay, tell me about the plane. Well, it still kind of smells like cigarettes from back in the day. [ doorbell rings ] Oh, wait, that's probably my medicine. But don't go away, okay? I want to talk to you until they make you turn off your cell phone. Okay. Rick? I couldn't do it. Rick? What's Rick doing there? He couldn't do it. Couldn't do what? I couldn't stop thinking about you. I got to go. Wait! No! Hello? Hello? - Hello, Val? - I'm sorry, but you're going to have to put away your cell phone. But Rick's there. He was supposed to marry Julie, but he couldn't, and now he's with my sister. That's nice, but could you please put your cell phone away? Yeah. Sorry. Do I have time to go to the bathroom? Sure. The ones in the front are open. Thank you. The one back here is open. Sync by chocomoon www.addic7ed.com
