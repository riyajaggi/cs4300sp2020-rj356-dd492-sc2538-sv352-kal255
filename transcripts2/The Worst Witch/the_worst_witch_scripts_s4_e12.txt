 You're sure your parents don't mind? There's just me and my dad. Hover! Mildred... Hover! If you can't reboot your magic, you'll never get back into Cackle's. You need your grounding stone. Where did you get this? A girlfriend, in Morocco. What was her name, this girlfriend? Hubble. Julie Hubble. This is my grounding stone. My magic's back! Woohoo! BIRDS CAW And as head girl, I would like to thank you all for making this

 so much more than I have ever dreamed of. ALL: I swear to do my witching duty, By witches' code, I shall abide. Respect our magic's power and beauty. Serve the great and good with pride. The Witch's Promise. Those special words remind us to be the very best witches we can be. It's been a long, hard battle, but today, we find a new head girl. THEY MURMUR There are always other schools, for me, I suppose. Just none of them will be the esteemed Cackle's Academy. Poor Mr Daisy. I wish we could do something to cheer him up.

 Uh, guys, am I really hearing this? We are witches, aren't we? Are we not standing next to a potion engine? What are you suggesting? Come on! A happiness potion. MACHINE HISSES AND WHIRS Which brings us to our final challenge - spell design. Without further ado... ..Ethel. APPLAUSE HE SNIFFS HE SIGHS HAPPILY Colours that hide in sunlight clear Across this room, they will now appear. ETHEREAL MUSIC Truly ingenious. And now, Mildred. Ooh! This is going to be good. Oh, Miss Cackle, could I borrow your glasses, please? I suppose so, Mildred. Thank you. Why do I need a pair of glasses, you may ask? Um... Well, I was trying to think of a useful spell, and... GLASSES CRUNCH, THEY GASP Perfectly good spectacles will now be thrown into Vanishment! Ooh! Can't we just magically repair them, Miss Hardbroom? It is notoriously difficult to create a spell with the requisite precision to mend broken things. Difficult? Yes. Impossible? No. What if we never had to throw anything away again? Mildred Hu... POTION HISSES AND BUBBLES Like cinders changed back into coal Like ancient horse once more a foal Like barley stalk returned to grain Make this object whole again! WINDS HOWL APPLAUSE We've seen two wonderful spells. Both were worthy, but the winner, and our new head girl,... ..is... ..Mildred Hubble. Wahey! Woo! Yay! Oh, my glasses. Oh, sorry! MISS CACKLE CHUCKLES SHE SIGHS WIND BLOWS GIRLS SCREAM Miss Cackle! The spell! Say your spell! Like barley stalk returned to grain Make this object whole again! Make this object whole again! Out. Everybody out! Move aside! Hear this now, as I implore Our beloved mistress to form restore. SPELL FADES OUT I can't believe it. Oh, cheer up, chuckle chops! Hey, who's for a game of witchball?! Er, let's go, Mr Daisy. Uh, it's the... It's the shock! HE CHUCKLES Feel the power of my command Ada Cackle, before me, stand With... With... With all the master of my craft, I... PIECES CRASH I... I don't understand. I... I... See what you've done, Mildred Hubble? See what you've done? Come on, Felicity. I changed the future. Millie? I caused the disaster instead of Ethel. Maud, it was me! Mildred Hubble, causing irreversible harm to another witch carries the strongest penalty. Miss Hardbroom, I'll fix it. I will hear nothing more from you. I should've stopped you long ago. The only place for you now is the correctional school for undesirable witches... ..Wormwood. You can't. Not Wormwood. Please! I'll call your mum...my mum, the Great Wizard. They'll stop this. Maud, stop. Miss Cackle is in a million pieces. This is what I deserve. Tabby! Star-Star! DISTORTED LAUGHTER Um... That's my spell book. I need that. But my broom... What is that badge? Oh... Nothing. Hey, we've got us a head girl here. I'm not a head girl. We don't like head girls. We don't like them at all. That cactus is over-watered. I can tell from... I can tell from the soil. It's going to rot from the roots up. Rot? Well...a girl in my year's a green witch. I've learned quite a lot from her, actually. You're killing it with kindness. Honestly. Lose the badge. FROM TABLET: Like cinders changed back into coal... Is it true? Mildred's been sent to Wormwood? Not for long. Not if I can help it. Look - the magic begins a moment before Mildred completes the spell. She thinks faster than she talks? No. Another spell cast at the same time. No wonder Mil couldn't reverse it. You mean someone else turned Miss Cackle into glass? But not Ethel. Then who? And why? We'll worry about that later. First we tell HB. Mildred's innocent. But Miss Hardbroom, we have proof. It can't have been Mildred. You have to bring her back. Mildred Hubble is the perpetrator. Mildred Hubble is ALWAYS the perpetrator. Now leave. I said... ..leave. Did I tell you to come over, head girl? Shouldn't we be learning magic? What you learn here is how to make potion bottles, pick ingredients and clean cauldrons all for other witches to use. But we're witches. I thought I could do anything with my magic, me. If I wanted to borrow my sister's party cape, I'd just transport it out of her wardrobe. Our Miranda got so mad, she ripped it up rather than let me wear it. That's when I transformed her. Transformed her? Into what? Oh! And you couldn't reverse it? I only get one shot. If I get it wrong, she sticks this way forever. And you never even tried? You've not met Miss Splinter yet, have you? She's in charge. I only ever learned one thing from her. You will too. We're the worst witches there are. Miss Hardbroom, you must listen. Mildred was framed. This subject is closed. The subject is not closed! You stubborn, narrow-minded, bad-tempered... Maud Spellbody, go to your hutch now. Mildred was framed. I said now. Do you want to join your friend in Wormwood? CAT MEOWS Tabby, you naughty cat! Were you hiding in my backpack? You'd better not let Splinter see. Familiars aren't allowed. I'm not letting anyone take Tabby. Stand by your beds! I'm telling you, for you own good, don't cross Splinter. Year 4. My least favourite year. Bed unmade, Lyla Grew - two demerits. Sloppy shoe-polishing, Maya Langhar - one demerit. Non-regulation hairstyle... Ah, yes, the new girl. Three demerits for each pigtail. I do hope you've settled in. Any questions? Actually... Well, the answer's no! MOCKING TONE: "Can I perform magic?" No! "Can I call my mummy?" No! "If I behave, can I go back to my old school?" No! And why is that, Year 4? MEEKLY: We're the worst witches. I can't hear you! LOUDER: We're the worst witches. Correct. And don't forget it! SHE SNIFFS Do I smell a living creature? I've told you time and again, Camilla Clove. If you won't keep it in the greenhouse, it stays in my office. No, you can't... Are you arguing with me? You know what happens to girls who argue with me. They go to the Room Of Itches That Cannot Be Scratched. No, not again! In! Or do you want double time? GHOULISH ROARS SHE YELLS For the benefit of the new girl, in the Room Of Itches That Cannot Be Scratched, one second feels like an hour, one minute feels like a day, one hour, a whole week. If you want to avoid it, you'll be a good bad witch. I wanna par-tay! No! Mr Daisy! If HB sees you like this, you really will be finished. HE CHUCKLES Er... A little help! MACHINE SPUTTERS Oh, no! What have you done?! Just tried to programme a reversal potion. I thought it would be easy! You could offer a hand, Mr...! Er... Where did he go? You shouldn't be here. TABBY MEOWS It's my fault. Trying to be the best witch at Cackle's, and this is where it got me. Bottom of the heap. DOOR THUDS Camilla, are you all right? Maud? Shh! You're innocent, Mil. I'm going to get you out of here. Miss Cackle was the best teacher I've ever known. She inspired me to be my best self. I could've never become Ethel's deputy otherwise. It's going to be a long... HE PLAYS JOLLY TUNE ON KAZOO Who's up for a singalong? Mr Daisy... Oh, are those turnips? I'm starving! Oi! Uh... The... The shock! HE CONTINUES PLAYING KAZOO Felicity's Ethel's deputy, right? Right. So Maud was right up there at the front of the hall for the final challenge. Where was Felicity? It really wasn't me? I saw it with my own eyes. You didn't do it. We're going to get you out of here and clear your name. There is no way out. Potions aren't allowed and broomsticks are locked up. Millie, would I really have got myself thrown in here without a plan? Witches have written books about their time in Wormwood. There's stuff I couldn't find out, though. Will there be wardens on duty? Where? What time? For that, we need someone who really knows the place. You're on my bed. A month. Splinter gave me a month. Let thunder roar, let lightning flash Let mighty waves on shorelines crash Take all my power But hear my plea Ada, now, return to me. SHE CLEARS THROAT You need to speak to Mr Daisy He's... He's taken this very badly. We'd get caught. I'd be in the itching room two months. This isn't just about Mildred. We're going to tell the Great Wizard what's going on here, get Wormwood shut down. All I ever did with my magic was get things wrong. I'm a bad witch. This is where I belong. You're not a bad witch. You've just been told that you're bad - there's a difference! Look... ..I was told that I was bad for years. And not just bad - the worst. And when you hear that stuff enough, you start believing it. You know, that little voice in your head, "You can't, "you'll get it wrong, don't even try". And so you don't try. But then the people who said you were bad can say it all over again! What if...? What if people just say that you're bad because they see something strong and powerful inside of you, and they don't like it? What if they just call you the worst because they're afraid that you might just be the best? THEY MURMUR INDISTINCTLY So...what's the plan? Mr Daisy, a word in private. Not...a...good idea, Miss Hardbroom. Cauldron curd, Fenella! Miss Hardbroom! If I could have this dance? Hm... Uh... TANGO MUSIC PLAYS SHE YELPS Mr Daisy! Sometimes dancing is the only thing that makes sense. Oh, he is toast! HE GASPS Oh! I don't know what came over me, Miss Hardbroom! I'm so sorry! Mr Daisy! I shall write to the Great Wizard to recommend that you never work in a school of magic ever again! I... I... I... Oh... I'm not happy. I'm really not happy about this. Hurry! Enough here to make 100 potions. We've got five minutes before she comes back. Four minutes till they know we're gone. DOOR THUDS BELL RINGS My sister first. Help me look. Here! I hate her! OK. Miranda, you're OK. Let's get out of... DISTANT MUTTERING AND FOOTSTEPS Demerits folder... Demerits folder... Strange. SPLINTER SNIFFS Do I smell a living creature here? TABBY MEOWS Familiar! FAMILIAR! Tabby! Three minutes - we have to go. I can't leave Tabby! This might be our last chance. You stick to the plan. I'll meet you at take-off point. Millie! DOG BARKS Can't a witch get a moment to herself around here? Is that what you were doing during the final challenge? I'm sorry? We just wondered why you weren't in the hall. I was on the magic mirror to Ethel's mother. She was more anxious than Ethel. Yarrow, cedar, old oak tree May this door now open be! Tabby! Tabby! ALARM BLARES What's that? They know we're missing from class. TABBY MEOWS Tabby, come here! Ah! I suppose you are the reason for that. I've seen your sort before. Think you're too good for this place. Well, you're not. You're just like all the rest - worthless, talentless, useless failures. The worst witches. Shall we say... ..three months? TABBY MEOWS No! MILDRED GROANS 100 demerits! Argh! THEY CHEER Those two first years, Jones and Moon, they're onto me. Well, you obviously did the spell spectacularly wrong. Oh, no, do not make this something that I did. You told me to do it! I never would've agreed if I'd known what it would do to Miss Cackle. It was only meant to spoil Mildred Hubble's spell. Whatever. I'm telling HB, before she hears it from someone else. You can't. I mean, it should come from me. I'll go to HB. ALARM BLARES We can't wait any longer. She'll make it. I know she'll... DOOR OPENS Too late. Millie! What we waiting for? Camilla! Camilla, come on! Someone's going to have to hold them off, or they'll catch you. What? No! Go. Tell the Great Wizard, get this place closed down. I'm not leaving you here on your own. I won't be on my own. I'm done listening to the little voice in my head. Cassia bark and costmary root Mix them up with an old frog fruit From her prickly prison, I plead Let my sister now be freed! Miranda! I did it! Go! Go! HARDBROOM: Forgive me, Ada. I didn't mean for this to happen. I only wanted to be head girl. DISEMBODIED VOICE: Don't worry, Ethel. It's all part of the plan! You said Mildred Hubble would lose. You didn't say how. I shall fix everything. Miss Cackle will return, and you will be head girl, as I promised. I don't know any more. Say the words. May north be south May west be east May Agatha Cackle now be released. SHE CACKLES You could bring someone back after being shattered into pieces? With the help of my engine, yes! We don't want that at all! This is what I saw in the future water. We've sent ourselves to Vanishment. We all know what happens to Vanishment at midnight on the last day of term. What happens?
