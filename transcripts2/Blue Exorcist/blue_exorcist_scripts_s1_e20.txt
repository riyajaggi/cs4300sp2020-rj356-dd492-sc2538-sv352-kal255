 [ YUKIO ] WHEN WE LIVED AT THE MONASTERY, I COULD ALWAYS TELL IF RIN WAS HOME BEFORE I EVEN WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR. AND IF HE HADN'T GOTTEN BACK BY DINNER, THE TABLE WAS ALWAYS UNUSUALLY QUIET. [ DOOR OPENS ] [ RIN ]

 I'M HOME. AND YOU'RE LATE. HEY, WELCOME HOME, RIN. DON'T TELL ME YOU GOT INTO ANOTHER FIGHT AGAIN. [ RIN ] PISS OFF. I'M A BUSY GUY. I GOT STUFF TO DO. WHATEVER THAT STUFF WAS, I'M SURE IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH GIRLS. [ RIN ] YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

[ GASPS ] [ MAN ] IT'S IN POLISH. "I WON'T FORGIVE ANYONE RELATED TO SATAN." YOU KNOW WHO THAT MEANS, DON'T YOU? WAIT. YOU TALKING ABOUT ME? [ YUKIO ] DO YOU KNOW WHO DID THIS? WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT. WHEN WE CAME THROUGH THE DOOR, ONE OF THE VICTIMS WAS STILL CONSCIOUS-- BARELY. HE WAS MUMBLING SOMETHING ABOUT A MAN IN A MASK. A MAN IN A MASK? [ MAN ] THIS WEB WAS SPUN BY DEMONIC POWERS. IT'S HARDENED INTO A CEMENT-LIKE SUBSTANCE AROUND THE VICTIMS' BODIES. BUT EVERYONE IS GONNA BE OKAY, RIGHT? [ YUKIO ] [ MAN ] THERE'S A THIN PROTECTIVE BARRIER SURROUNDING THEIR BODIES. THEY MUST HAVE STARTED RECITING HOLY VERSES JUST BEFORE THEY WERE ATTACKED. THE BARRIERS ARE KEEPING THEM ALIVE, BUT THEY WON'T LAST LONG. MAYBE EIGHT HOURS. [ YUKIO ] UNTIL 2:00 A.M. TOMORROW. [ MAN ] THIS SUBSTANCE IS SOMETHING WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THE ANTIDOTE, BUT WE'RE NOT HAVING MUCH LUCK. [ GRUNTS ] [ GRUNTING ] RIN! KNOCK IT OFF, YUKIO! WHOEVER DID THIS WAS AFTER YOU, RIN. RIGHT. SO IF I'M OUT IN THE OPEN, THEY'LL TRY TO-- IF YOU GO, YOU'LL BE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THEIR HANDS. I MADE A PROMISE TO DAD THAT I'D DO EVERYTHING I COULD TO PROTECT YOU. DAMN IT, RIN, WHY CAN'T YOU JUST TRUST ME FOR ONCE? DON'T GIVE ME THAT. I DON'T NEED MY LITTLE BROTHER TO LOOK OUT FOR ME. I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF, DAMN IT! [ GASPS ] - [ GRUNTS ] - WE DON'T GOT TIME TO ARGUE. RIN! [ RIN, THINKING ] WHERE IS HE? WHERE'D HE GO? [ PANTING ] [ GASPS ] OKAY, WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? YOU'VE BEEN AFTER ME FROM THE START, HAVEN'T YOU? YOU KNOW HOW IT FEELS. THE PAIN OF LOSING THE ONES YOU LOVE. SHUT UP, YOU SON OF A-- HEY! [ GRUNTS ] [ LAUGHING ] OH, I WON'T KILL YOU RIGHT AWAY. AT LEAST NOT UNTIL YOU'VE EXPERIENCED THE KIND OF AGONY I HAVE. - [ GASPS ] - [ YUKIO ] RIN! THE LITTLE BROTHER COMES TO THE RESCUE. YUKIO! [ LAUGHS ] [ GRUNTS ] COME BACK! SHURA. WOULD YOU CHILL OUT ALREADY? EVERY TIME YOU RUN OFF LIKE THIS, THEY SEND MY ASS IN TO BAIL YOU OUT. HEY, WAIT! FREEZE! HUH? IT'S MR. NOIHAUS. [ NOIHAUS ] I WON'T FORGIVE SATAN OR ANY DEMON I COME ACROSS. AND THAT GOES FOR THE SON OF SATAN AS WELL! THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT? REVENGE? IT WAS YOU. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO ATTACKED THE MONASTERY, DIDN'T YOU? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU KNOW DAMN WELL. THAT SPIDER WEB ON YOUR SHOULDER-- SPUN BY DEMONIC POWERS. THE MONASTERY'S COVERED IN IT, SO THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT YOU'RE INVOLVED. YOU FAIL SO EPICALLY. [ GASPS ] YOUR DEDUCTION IS FLAWED AT BEST. YOU CAN FIND COBWEB LIKE THIS ANYWHERE, EVEN IN HERE. SPARE ME YOUR EXCUSES. THE MESSAGE LEFT BEHIND WAS WRITTEN IN YOUR NATIVE TONGUE-- POLISH. ARE RELATED TO SATAN, AND SINCE YOU KNOW MY BROTHER AND I THAT MAKES YOU THE PRIME SUSPECT. YOU CANNOT HOPE TO SEE THE TRUTH WHEN YOUR VISION IS CLOUDED BY SUSPICION. YOU'RE COMING WITH ME. WHAT THE TRUTH IS AT THE ACADEMY. WE'LL FIND OUT REALLY? AND IF I REFUSE? [ RUMBLING ] [ GASPS ] [ CRASHING, CLATTERING ] HE GOT AWAY. [ RIN GRUNTING ] CAN'T GET IT OUT. WHAT THE HELL? THIS THING'S REALLY STUCK. [ SHURA ] NOIHAUS, HUH? YES. HE'S THE ONLY PERSON I CAN THINK OF WHO HAS THE MOTIVE TO GO AFTER RIN. IT WASN'T A COINCIDENCE THAT HE WAS THERE. I HEARD HE BAILED ON HIS POST AT THE ACADEMY... AND WENT BACK TO WHEREVER THE HELL HE CAME FROM. BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT, I GOT THE STORY FROM THAT SKETCH BALL, MEPHISTO, SO WHO KNOWS IF THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE DEAL IS. HANG ON. THAT HOLE WE FOUND IN THE BARRIER WASN'T JUST A HOLE. IT WAS OPENED WITH A KEY. YOU SAID IT WAS USED FOR EXPERIMENTS ON ARTIFICIAL LIFE. THE LAB. IF I RECALL, [ SHURA ] UH-HUH. IF YOU WANNA STUDY ARTIFICIAL LIFE, YOU STITCH THE CORPSES OF HUMANS AND ANIMALS TOGETHER. IT'S ALSO HOW YOU MAKE A NABERIUS. THAT LINKS NOIHAUS TO IT, ALL RIGHT. ALTHOUGH IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FORBIDDEN. THE VATICAN IS CRYSTAL CLEAR ON THAT ISSUE. [ GROWLS ] NOW WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? I'VE GOTTA STOP HIM. AND HOW DO YOU PLAN ON DOING THAT? YOU CAN'T EVEN DRAW YOUR SWORD. I'M GOING, ALONG WITH THE OTHER INSTRUCTORS. I'M NOT GONNA LET ANYONE ELSE GET HURT 'CAUSE OF ME. THIS IS MY FIGHT TOO, SO I'M GOING. YOU'RE NOT, AND THAT'S THAT. [ GRUNTS ] THIS ISN'T OPEN FOR DISCUSSION. FOR ONCE YOU'RE GOING TO FOLLOW MY ORDERS OR ELSE. [ GUN COCKS ] DON'T POINT THAT THING AT ME, YUKIO. STOP SCREWING AROUND, MAN. I'M DEAD SERIOUS, RIN. ALTHOUGH... IF YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE ME WITH THOSE DEMONIC POWERS OF YOURS, GO AHEAD. TRY IT, I DARE YOU. DAMN IT, YUKIO. STOP IT. OKAY, WHOA. PUT THE GUN DOWN, YUKIO. [ GRUNTS ] WHAT THE HELL? IT WAS JUST A TRANQUILIZER DART. YEAH, WELL, EVEN FOR YOU, THAT WAS A LITTLE MUCH. IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT MY BROTHER, SO STAY OUT OF IT. - YUKIO-- - [ GROANING ] [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ] YUKI... O. [ GROANS ] [ TSUBAKI ] YOU THINK NOIHAUS IS DOWN THERE? THAT'S WHERE THE SIGNAL'S COMING FROM, AND THE TRACKER'S NEVER WRONG. WE'LL GO IN TWO AT A TIME. THE TALISMANS I GAVE YOU WON'T PROTECT YOU, BUT THEY'RE BETTER THAN NOTHING. IF YOU GET COVERED IN THE WEB, RECITE HOLY SCRIPTURE TO KEEP FROM SUFFOCATING. OKAY? [ ALL ] MM-HMM. [ FOOTSTEPS RUNNING ] [ ELECTRONIC BEEPING, FAINT ] [ BEEPING ] DO YOU HEAR THAT? SHH. [ BEEPING ] [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] [ BOTH ] FREEZE! DAMN IT! PERSISTENT PESTS. NOIHAUS, HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM. [ BEEPING ] [ GASPS ] [ GRUNTS ] HOLD IT! [ SCREAMING ] OH, NO. MR. YUNOKAWA! [ BOTH GASP ] [ GROANING ] YUKIO, YOU BASTARD. [ GROANS ] [ LAUGHS ] MORNING, SLEEPYHEAD. THAT TRANQUILIZER'S GOT YOU BUZZING. RELAX, TAKE IT EASY. CRAP. WHERE IS HE? WHAT THE HELL'S GOTTEN INTO HIM ANYWAY? YEAH. I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM TOO. THAT DOES IT. I'D BETTER GO. NOT SO FAST. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID? YOU DON'T GET THE SWORD UNTIL YOU CAN PROVE TO ME... YOU'VE GOT CONTROL OVER THOSE FLAMES OF YOURS. YOU'D BE USELESS IF YOU WENT ANYWAY. - WHAT DID YOU SAY? - YOU GONNA LET THE BAD GUYS JERK US AROUND FOREVER? 'CAUSE AS LONG AS YOU'RE AT THE MERCY OF YOUR FLAMES, THEY WILL. [ GASPS ] ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LEARN TO CONTROL 'EM. THEN YOU WON'T SCARE YOUR FRIENDS... OR MAKE 'EM WORRY... OR MAKE ANYONE ELSE SUFFER 'CAUSE OF YOU. CAN'T YOU SEE THAT? DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT? I DO. IT'S JUST-- THEN YOU ALSO KNOW YOU HAVE TO DO THIS FIRST. ARE YOU KIDDING? THIS AIN'T THE TIME TO BE DOING STUPID DRILLS. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. THIS IS ACTUAL COMBAT. [ GASPS ] THE CANDLES REPRESENT THE PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT. UNLESS YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTROL YOUR FLAMES, THEY'RE ALL GONNA DIE. SO HERE'S YOUR CHANCE, AND YOU ONLY GET ONE. [ GRUNTS ] IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S A DRILL OR COMBAT. NO ONE'S EVER GONNA TRUST YOU UNTIL YOU CAN GET THOSE FLAMES UNDER CONTROL. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, KID? AN INVITATION? USE YOUR WILLPOWER AND MAKE THOSE DAMN FLAMES DO WHAT YOU WANT 'EM TO. [ THINKING ] RIGHT. MY WILLPOWER. [ TSUBAKI ] THEN THERE'S NO DOUBT-- HE HAS AN ACCOMPLICE. THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] YES. TSUBAKI SPEAKING. WHAT? MM. MM-HMM. I UNDERSTAND.

ARE YOU A DEMON OR HUMAN? [ GRUNTING ] [ SHOUTING ] - [ SHOUTING ] - BON! [ SCREAMING ] [ MURMURING ] YOU GET A VISUAL? NO, BUT ACCORDING TO SOME OF THE STUDENTS, IT WAS A MAN. HE WAS WEARING A MASK. OH! MOST OF THE KIDS GOT OUT OF THE BUILDING, BUT THERE'S STILL A FEW THAT WE KNOW OF IN THE CAFETERIA. THE WITNESSES SAY THEY'RE CRAM SCHOOL STUDENTS. - [ YUKIO ] GREAT. - HAS HE MADE ANY DEMANDS YET? OUT OF THE BUILDING. HE SAID IF WANT TO GET THE KIDS BACK ALIVE, EVERYONE HAS TO STAY EXCEPT-- EXCEPT WHO? EVERYONE EXCEPT THE SON OF SATAN, SIR. HMPH? [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ] A RATHER BOLD MOVE, WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

YOU ARE SUSPECTED OF BEING INVOLVED WITH THE RESEARCH OF ARTIFICIAL LIFE-FORMS, WHICH, AS YOU KNOW, IS PROHIBITED BY THE VATICAN. WHAT? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU MEAN. IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY, YOU CAN SAY IT FROM YOUR PRISON CELL AT THE VATICAN. TAKE HIM AWAY. [ BOTH GASP ] I SHALL NEITHER RUN NOR HIDE. STILL, I WONDER-- THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT TO APPEAR? WHY WOULD YOU PICK I URGE YOU TO RESOLVE THIS. WE HAVE ENOUGH ON OUR PLATE AS IT IS. WAIT A SEC. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. HE SAID ARTIFICIAL LIFE. HOLD ON A MINUTE. DON'T GO IN THERE. [ YUKIO ] THE LEAST I CAN DO IS FIND OUT HOW MANY SUSPECTS WE'RE DEALING WITH. I CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE. YOU SHOULD WAIT FOR BACKUP TO ARRIVE FIRST. BESIDES, SHOULDN'T YOU CALL YOUR BROTHER? HE COULD HELP. - OUT OF THE QUESTION. - [ GASPS ] WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT CALL HIM. WAIT! MR. OKUMURA!
