 SURPRISE! THIS WAS NO ORDINARY BOOT CAMP, KIDS. IN FACT, YOU'VE JUST COMPLETED YOUR EXWIRE AUTHORIZATION EXAM. UH-- IT'S RATHER SNEAKY, I KNOW. THIS WHOLE TIME WE HAD A TEAM OF INSTRUCTORS HIDDEN THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING... IN PLACES WHERE THEY COULD OBSERVE YOUR EVERY MOVE. AFTER I HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW THEIR REPORTS, I'LL BE THE ONE TO DETERMINE WHO PASSED AND WHO FAILED. I'M SURE YOU'RE AS ANXIOUS AS I AM TO SEE HOW YOU DID. ♪♪ [ MAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] DAMN IT! MAN, THAT WAS THE WORST POP QUIZ EVER. [ SUGURO ] THEY TRICKED US PRETTY GOOD. I WISH I WOULD'VE KNOWN BECAUSE I COULD'VE PREPARED FOR IT. OH, BOY. I WONDER IF I PASSED. DON'T TORTURE YOURSELF. THERE'S NO USE WORRYING ABOUT IT NOW. YOU AND SHIMA DON'T HAVE TO WORRY. BUT ME-- I WAS SO SCARED I COULDN'T MOVE MY LEGS. I'M SURE YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE FINE. REMEMBER WHAT MR. OKUMURA TOLD US BEFORE THE TEST STARTED? EXORCISTS DO NOT GO INTO BATTLE ALONE. SO COOL OFF AND GET ALONG UNTIL I GET BACK. BEING AN EXWIRE TAKES COOPERATION. THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH THEIR TEAM DURING COMBAT. IN THAT SENSE, NO ONE DID WORSE THAN ME. YOU NEED TO CUT YOURSELF SOME SLACK THERE. YOU STEPPED UP, NOT LIKE THOSE GUYS. THEY JUST SAT AROUND. YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY FOR YOURSELVES? HUH? OH, SWEET. I JUST SCORED MYSELF A DRAGON CLAW. HA! WHY DON'T YOU SHUT YOUR PIE HOLE? WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO A BUNCH OF WHINY BRATS LIKE YOU. [ GROWLING ] WHOA, THEY TALKED! THEY'VE BEEN MYSTERIOUS SINCE THE FIRST DAY. AND THAT GUY ROCKS AT VENTRILOQUISM. [ GROANS ] UH, SHOOT. I WOKE YOU UP. MY BAD. OH, NO. IT'S OKAY. I'M FEELING BETTER NOW. REALLY. WHAT WERE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT? OH, JUST ABOUT THE EXAM AND STUFF. AND ABOUT HOW AWESOME YOU WERE. YOU OUTDID US ALL. IF YOU WEREN'T THERE, MORIYAMA, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO US. WE OWE YOU BIG-TIME. WHAT? UH, NO. I SHOULD BE THANKING YOU. I KNOW YOU'LL PASS THE EXAM. WITHOUT A DOUBT. [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH, IF YOU DON'T PASS, WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT GONNA PASS. [ GIGGLES ] HEY, OKUMURA, HOW DID YOU KILL THAT GHOUL ALL BY YOURSELF? HUH? OH, WELL, I, UH-- I SORT OF... SHOVED THIS INTO IT. WHOA, THAT'S AMAZING. MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY TO BE A KNIGHT. OKAY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SHOVED INTO IT? COULD YOU BE ANY MORE VAGUE? IF YOU ASK ME, YOU'RE THE MYSTERIOUS ONE. UH-HUH. IT'S LIKE I DON'T LOOK IT, BUT I GOT THIS CERTAIN "MISTAKE" ABOUT ME. [ LAUGHS ] YOU JUST SAID "MISTAKE." OH, I MEANT "MISKEE." "MISKOO." IT'S "MYSTIQUE," YOU DUMBASS. HE'S A PAGE, BUT HE BEAT A MID-LEVEL DEMON WITHOUT ANY BACKUP. WITH ONLY A SWORD? NO WAY. HE REALLY IS A MYSTERY. [ LAUGHING ] [ YUKIO ] MR. NOIHAUS. I'D LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU. WHAT IS IT? IT'S ABOUT YESTERDAY. YOUR ACTIONS OVERSTEPPED THE BOUNDARIES OF THE EXAM. WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH? EVEN IF IT WAS FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES, YOU EXPOSED THE STUDENTS TO UNNECESSARY DANGER. THE EXAM COULD'VE TURNED INTO A DISASTER. ALSO, YOU ALMOST FORCED MY BROTHER TO REVEAL HIS POWER IN FRONT OF THE OTHER STUDENTS. ONLY A HANDFUL OF INSTRUCTORS HERE KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT RIN'S CAPABILITIES. SIR PHELES MUST HAVE SWORN YOU TO SECRECY LIKE HE DID THE REST OF US. YOUR CONCERNS ARE NOTED. HOWEVER, I WAS ACTING ON SIR PHELES' ORDERS. [ GASPS ] HE TOLD ME TO TRY TO KILL HIM. HE SAID THAT? MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION IS... THAT YOU ARE TO SERVE AS THE BRAKES TO HIS POWER. AS THE ACCELERATOR. IF THAT IS SO, THEN I AM TO SERVE AND THE PURPOSE OF IT ALL IS TO GAIN AN ACCURATE READING OF RIN OKUMURA'S CAPABILITIES. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? THAT, MY YOUNG COLLEAGUE, SHOULD BE OBVIOUS. WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN USE HIM AS A WEAPON FOR THE ORDER. WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT YOU MUST BE VERY BUSY THESE DAYS, BEING A BRILLIANT EXORCIST AND ALL. THE LEAST WE COULD DO IS HELP WITH THE CHORE OF BABY-SITTING YOUR DEMON BROTHER. HIS EMOTIONS AND HIS POWER JUST FINE. MY BROTHER CAN CONTROL FOR THE TIME BEING. YOU'VE SEEN IT WITH YOUR OWN EYES. BUT DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE HIS ABILITIES. COME NOW. I'M NOT REALLY GOING TO KILL YOUR BROTHER. YOU HAVE MY WORD ON THAT. [ FROGS CROAKING ] WE HAD A BUSY DAY YESTERDAY, DIDN'T WE, NEE? NEE! NEE-EE! - THANK YOU. - BUT YOU DID SAVE US TODAY. WE REALLY OWE YOU BIG-TIME. NEE! [ GASPS ] WELCOME TO THE STORE. HI, SHIEMI. HOW ARE YOU? [ GASPS ] YUKI! SORRY TO COME HERE SO LATE. IS YOUR MOM IN? SHE WENT TO GET MORE SUPPLIES, SO I'M WATCHING THE STORE. CAN I HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING? [ SHRIEKING ] WE'RE ALONE! ACTUALLY, I CAME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR FUTURE PLANS. ARE YOU FREE, OR SHOULD I COME BACK? WELL, I'M IN A WEIRD SPOT... BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO CRAM SCHOOL TO BE AN EXORCIST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT MEISTER TO WRITE DOWN. I WISH I WASN'T SO UNSURE ABOUT THINGS. UH, SHIEMI, DO YOU REMEMBER THE DAY WE FIRST MET... - WHEN I CAME HERE WITH MY FATHER? - HUH? I HAD JUST BECOME AN EXORCIST, AND I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. I WAS SO NERVOUS AND TENSE. [ GASPS ] LOOSEN UP. YOU'RE GONNA BLOW A FUSE IF YOU'RE WOUND UP LIKE THAT. IT'S JUST A SUPPLY SHOP. RIGHT! WHAT'S SHAKIN', MA'AM? THIS IS MY SON, YUKIO. AND AS OF TODAY, HE'S AN EXORCIST. THING IS, KID'S NOT EVEN 14 YET, SO IF I'M NOT AROUND, KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. PLEASED TO MEET YOU, MA'AM. WELL, WELL, WELL, WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? MY, YOU LOOK LIKE SUCH A FINE YOUNG MAN. OH, WAIT. WHERE IS SHIEMI? SHIEMI, CAN YOU COME OUT FOR A SECOND? HMM? [ GASPS ] THAT'S MY DAUGHTER. SHE'S LIKE A LITTLE GHOST, ISN'T SHE? [ LAUGHS ] SHE'S AS SHY AS A MOUSE-- NOTHING LIKE HER MOTHER, THAT'S FOR SURE. COME ON OUT. THIS YOUNG MAN IS THE SAME AGE AS YOU, AND GUESS WHAT? HE'S AN EXORCIST TEACHER. PLEASED TO MEET YOU. MY NAME IS YUKIO OKUMURA. HELLO. AH! [ CHUCKLES ] POOR THING'S AS SHY AS SHE EVER WAS. I THOUGHT AT THE VERY LEAST SHE'D STICK AROUND AND GET TO KNOW SOMEONE HER OWN AGE. DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY. [ SHIEMI ] TEACHER! WELL, NOW. TEACHER. HMM. OH. WHO, ME? HERE'S A CHARM... FOR YOU. PLEASE BE CAREFUL AT WORK. OH. THANK YOU. TEACHER. UH, LISTEN, UM, CALLING ME TEACHER'S SO FORMAL. COULD YOU CALL ME SOMETHING MORE CASUAL INSTEAD? [ SHRIEKS ] OKAY. YOU COULD CALL ME-- I'LL CALL YOU YUKI. - HOW ABOUT IF I CALL YOU YUKI? - HUH? OH. WELL, I-- IT'S CUTE. I GUESS THAT'LL WORK. - SURE. WHY NOT? - [ SIGHS ] I'M OKAY WITH THAT. I'M SORRY. I WAS EVEN WEIRDER BACK THEN THAN I AM NOW. THIS AMAZING PERSON, AND I REALLY LOOKED UP TO YOU. IT'S JUST-- THERE YOU WERE, WELL, AMAZING MIGHT BE GOING A BIT TOO FAR. - HUH? - BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I WAS A CRYBABY. MY BROTHER WAS ALWAYS THE ONE WHO GOT ME OUT OF TROUBLE. NO WAY. REALLY? YOU? THAT'S RIGHT. HE WAS ALWAYS ABLE TO DO THE THINGS THAT I COULDN'T. MY BROTHER WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED TO BE. I LOOKED UP TO HIM. HE'S SWEET. I CAN SEE WHY YOU WOULD. YOU'RE RIGHT. HE IS. WE ALL HAVE TO GROW UP, DON'T WE? BUT AT SOME POINT, YOU WORKED HARD TO GET THIS FAR, SHIEMI. YOU'VE CHANGED A LOT. BUT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP ATTENDING CLASSES AT THE CRAM SCHOOL, YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION. SHIEMI, EVERYONE KNOWS YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A TAMER. I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO REALLY THINK ABOUT. TALK TO YOUR MOTHER FIRST, AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOUR DECISION IS BY TOMORROW. - I HAVE TO TALK TO MY MOM? - YOU SHOULD. IF YOU BECOME AN EXWIRE, YOU'LL HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO FACE LIFE-OR-DEATH SITUATIONS. WE'LL NEED HER CONSENT FOR THAT. YEAH, THAT FIGURES. DURING THE EXAM I WASN'T SO SURE I WAS EVEN GOING TO MAKE IT. RIGHT. I KNOW THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A GRUELING EXPERIENCE FOR YOU. BUT IT WAS ONLY A TEST, AFTER ALL. WE TOOK EXTRA MEASURES, SO YOU WEREN'T IN ANY REAL DANGER. AT LEAST... THAT'S WHAT THE PLAN WAS. ALL THE TEACHERS HAD... YOUR SAFETY IN MIND. I'M NOT REALLY GOING TO KILL YOUR BROTHER. [ GASPS ] EXCUSE ME. I HAVE TO GO NOW. BUT, YUKI-- I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS. [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ] [ CRICKETS CHIRPING ] [ SNORING ] [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] [ GASPS, SIGHS ] [ GUN COCKS ] I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T GOING TO KILL HIM, MR. NOIHAUS. WELL PLAYED, YUKIO OKUMURA. RIN? [ YELLS ] SHIEMI! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM? NOT THAT I MIND OR ANYTHING. SHH. WE'RE NOT IN YOUR ROOM. YOU WOULDN'T WAKE UP, SO YUKI BROUGHT YOU HERE. HE SAID TO LET YOU SLEEP, BUT I HEARD SOMETHING. - [ TWO GUNSHOTS ] - [ BOTH GASP ] COME FORTH! NOIHAUS, WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL MY BROTHER? [ GRUNTING ] YOU'RE SLOW. WON'T GATHER ROUND, ARISE. FROM A CORPSE IN THE GROUND WHERE VULTURES [ LAUGHS ] YOU'RE ABOUT TO MEET THE HIGHEST RANKING NABERIUS... AMONGST ALL MY PAWNS. [ ROARING ] [ LAUGHING ] I HAVE TO BREAK THE MAGIC CIRCLE. [ YUKIO ] [ GRUNTS ] [ GROWLING ] [ ROARING ] DAMN YOU! I KNEW IT! - YOU CURSED DEMON! - [ RIN SHOUTING ] YOU LOOK HUMAN, BUT HOLY WATER WORKS ON YOU LIKE ALL DEMONS. [ LAUGHS ] EVEN WITH THE SKIN YOU'RE WEARING. YOU CAN'T HIDE YOUR NATURE, HOLY WATER? WHAT THE HELL? [ SHOUTING ] [ SCREAMING ] [ LAUGHS ] WHAT THE-- [ PANTING ] DAMN. HE BROKE THE CIRCLE. NOIHAUS, FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, YOU'D BETTER STOP THIS NOW. IF YOU LOSE ANY MORE BLOOD, YOU'LL DIE. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU? WHAT AM I? A SURVIVOR OF THE BLUE NIGHT. THE BLUE NIGHT? SIXTEEN YEARS AGO SATAN CROSSED THE BARRIER TO OUR WORLD... HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. AND MASSACRED ALL THE TOP CLERGYMEN. WE'VE CALLED IT THE BLUE NIGHT EVER SINCE. YOU DON'T SAY? IT LASTED A FEW SECONDS. MY BODY WAS POSSESSED BY SATAN, AND I LOST THIS. MY EYE. THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO TO STOP IT. AND WHEN MY FAMILY TRIED TO SAVE ME, SATAN TOOK OVER MY HAND AND USED IT TO SLAUGHTER THEM ALL. I WON'T FORGIVE SATAN... OR ANY DEMON I COME ACROSS. AND THAT GOES FOR THE SON OF SATAN AS WELL! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU, EVEN IF IT MEANS I DIE DOING IT! [ GROANING ] DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER? RIN! IF YOU THINK YOU'RE STILL NOT SATISFIED, I CAN HANDLE MORE. I'M USED TO IT. PICK THE TIME, AND I'LL BE THERE WAITING FOR YOU. BUT YOU GOTTA PROMISE ME... THAT YOU WON'T DRAG INNOCENT PEOPLE INTO IT AGAIN. [ GASPS ] DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND THAT IT'S OVER. I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT'D LOVE TO SEE YOU DIE. GET READY FOR WHAT'S COMING. [ PANTING ] [ PANTING ] NEE? YUKI? RIN? MR. NOIHAUS. WHAT HAPPENED? JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. IT'S ALREADY STARTING TO CLOSE UP. YOU KNOW ME. I ALWAYS HEALED UP PRETTY QUICK. I GUESS THAT MEANS I REALLY AM A MONSTER. [ DOOR BANGS ] [ SHIEMI ] YUKI! RIN! SHIEMI. R-RIN! WHAT HAPPENED? [ GASPS ] UH, NOTHING. I'M FINE. THAT'S A GHOUL TEMPTAINT! I HAVE TO TREAT IT. NO. I'M OKAY. NO, YOU'RE NOT. NO ARGUMENTS. LIE DOWN AND TRY TO STAY CALM. HUH? I SAID LIE DOWN! NEE, MAY I HAVE SOME MR. SANCHO? NEE! [ CHUCKLES ] THAT'S GREAT, THANKS. YEAH, I THINK IT'S WORKING. I FEEL WAY BETTER NOW. RIN, I'VE DECIDED. HUH? I'VE DECIDED. OKAY. WHAT'D YOU DECIDE? RIN, YOU WERE ALWAYS ABLE TO DO THE THINGS I COULDN'T. OH, WELL. GUESS I'LL NEVER BE A MATCH FOR HIM. EINS, ZWEI, DREI. CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING THE EXAM! YOU'VE ALL BEEN PROMOTED TO BECOME EXWIRES. [ CHEERING ] ALL RIGHT! - THANK GOODNESS. - [ LAUGHS ] AND TO CELEBRATE, I'M TREATING YOU ALL TO A FEAST. WHO'S HUNGRY FOR MONJA? [ ALL ] WHAT? MONJA? BARBECUE'S WAY BETTER. [ RIN ] SO YOU'RE GONNA BE AN EXORCIST, HUH? YEP. I'M GONNA HELP EVERYONE OUT. UH, YOU GONNA BE OKAY FIGHTING? OF COURSE I'LL BE OKAY. REALLY? I MUST APOLOGIZE FOR MR. NOIHAUS'S RECENT BEHAVIOR. BELIEVE ME, I NEVER DREAMED HE'D LET HIS PERSONAL FEELINGS INTERFERE IN SUCH A WAY. I'LL MAKE SURE SUCH A THING NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. I'D APPRECIATE IT. [ SHIMA ] HEY, MR. OKUMURA, WOULD YOU LIKE SOME RAMUNE? YES, PLEASE. THANK YOU. [ LINE RINGING ] GUESS WHO. [ AMAIMON ] YES? NOIHAUS FOLLOWED MY ORDERS. TO FINISHING THE TASK, HE CAME UP SHORT. HOWEVER, WHEN IT CAME COME TO TRUE CROSS ACADEMY RIGHT AWAY. BUT YOUR PROTECTIVE BARRIER PREVENTS ME FROM ENTERING, BIG BROTHER. I'LL HAVE NOIHAUS GUIDE YOU. WE'LL DISCUSS THE DETAILS LATER. UNDERSTOOD? ROGER THAT. [ GASPS ] [ SUGURO ] IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S DONE. [ RIN LAUGHS ] I'M DIGGING IN! HOLD IT, KIDDIES! DON'T START WITHOUT ME! [ BEEPING ] [ SIGHS ] ARE SO OBSESSED WITH THIS RIN OKUMURA. MY FATHER AND BROTHER I WONDER IF HE'S REALLY THAT SPECIAL. I HOPE HE CAN ENTERTAIN ME FOR A LITTLE WHILE. ♪♪ [ MAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] [ RIN LAUGHING ] GONNA SCOOP IT ALL UP! NO, PLEASE! YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT ONE! THE CHEESE-BACON-MOCHI MONJA IS ONE OF MY TOP THREE MONJA MUNCHIES EVER! I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR OF THE ACADEMY. WHEN IT COMES TO EATING, IT'S FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED.
