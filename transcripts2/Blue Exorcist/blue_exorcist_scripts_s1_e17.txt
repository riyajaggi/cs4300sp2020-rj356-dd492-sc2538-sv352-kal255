 THE SCENT OF RIN OKUMURA. [ SHOUTING ] AH, HE'S OVER THERE. - HUH? - [ GROWLING ] FOR YOUR SAFETY, STAY BACK, MY LADY. AH, SHUT UP, YOU HIPPIE! CALIBAN, LEND ME YOUR POWER. REALLY, ARTHUR, YOU'RE SUCH A SLAVE DRIVER. [ GRUNTS ] KIRIGAKURE SWORD TECHNIQUE, SNAKE BELLY FORM. SNAKE FANG! [ ROARING ] [ GASPS ] HOW DARE YOU. YOU KILLED MY BEHEMOTH! [ RUMBLING ] [ GRUNTING ] [ SCREAMING ] [ LAUGHS ] I FOUND YOU. [ LAUGHING ] [ SHOUTING ] [ SHOUTING ] NO PRESSURE, BUT THE POLLS WILL BE CLOSING SOON. TIME TO CAST YOUR VOTES-- YEA OR NAY. YOU FIEND! YOU CAME KNOWING FULL WELL THIS WOULD HAPPEN, DIDN'T YOU? THIS WAS ALL A PLOY. YOU KNEW SATAN'S SPAWN WOULD ATTRACT ANOTHER DEMON. I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. THE SITUATION, SHOULDN'T YOU BE PROTECTING THE GRIGORI... INSTEAD OF OVERANALYZING AND NOT POINTING YOUR LIVE LITTLE FINGER AT ME? I'VE COME TO SETTLE THINGS, RIN OKUMURA. [ EXPLOSION ] YOU LITTLE PEST! STICK AROUND. AFTER THIS, I'LL COME AND KILL EACH ONE OF YOU TOO. ENOUGH, SIR PHELES. I DON'T CARE WHAT METHODS YOU EMPLOY. EXTERMINATE THAT DEMON AT ONCE. YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND. OKUMURA! YOU GONNA SLEEP ALL DAY? WAKE THE HELL UP! [ SLOW, THUNDEROUS POUNDING ] IS THAT-- KURIKARA. THEY WERE ABLE TO FIX IT. I CAN HEAR IT-- RIN OKUMURA'S HEARTBEAT. GIVE ME THAT SWORD! SHIMA! WHAT THE-- BAD IDEA. [ GROANS ] CATCH! WHAT? DON'T THROW IT TO ME. - [ YUKIO ] OVER HERE, KAMIKI. - CATCH! YUKIO! TEACH! [ GROANING ] COME ON. WAKE UP, RIN. WAKE UP! THE BLUE FLAMES. THEY'RE AS BRIGHT AS THEY WERE THAT NIGHT. [ CHUCKLING ] [ RIN THINKING ] WHERE AM I? I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING. AM I DEAD? NO. I CAN HEAR IT. THAT'S MY-- MY HEART. I'LL CRUSH YOU! I'M NOT DEAD... YET. IMPOSSIBLE. I AM KING OF EARTH. HOW COULD I LOSE? HOW COULD I EVER LOSE? BROTHER! [ YUKIO ] RIN! [ SHIEMI ] RIN! HEY, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? I'M GOING TO SEVER THE BLOODLINE OF SATAN. STAND DOWN, ANGEL. WE'VE DECIDED TO ACCEPT THE WAGER PROPOSED BY SIR PHELES. WHETHER HE BECOMES THE SAVIOR OF ASSIAH, OR HE BECOMES THE DEMON WHO DESTROYS IT, WE HAVE NO CHOICE NOW BUT TO WAIT AND SEE. ♪♪ [ MEN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] [ MEPHISTO ] I SUPPOSE YOU'RE ALL WONDERING... WHY I'VE ASKED YOU HERE ON THIS FINE DAY. WE'VE JUST RECEIVED AN ORDER FROM THE VATICAN. AS OF TODAY, RIN OKUMURA, WHO HAPPENS TO BE THE SON OF SATAN, WILL BECOME OUR CHARGE AT TRUE CROSS ACADEMY. - QUESTIONS? - SIR? YES, MR. YUNOKAWA. THERE'S BEEN TALK ABOUT THE FOREST FIRE THAT BROKE OUT, AND THAT IT HAPPENED BECAUSE OKUMURA LOST CONTROL OF HIS POWER. - I CAN'T SAY FOR CERTAIN YOU AREN'T. - ARE WE IN ANY DANGER HERE? THAT BEING THE CASE, IF THE BOY SHOULD HAPPEN TO GO BERSERK AGAIN FOR ANY REASON, WE HAVE ORDERS TO EXTERMINATE HIM. - [ MURMURING ] - THIS SOUNDS FAR TOO RISKY. WOULDN'T HE BE BETTER OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE? I MEAN, IS THERE A REASON WE HAVE TO TAKE HIM IN? OH, MY, THERE'S NO REASON. [ ALL ] WHAT? THERE'S A TON OF POTENTIAL BUBBLING IN RIN OKUMURA, AND I'M BETTING ON WHETHER OR NOT WE'LL SEE HIM LIVE UP TO IT. [ WARBLING ] [ YUKIO ] SIR PHELES. - YES? - YOU SPOKE OF MY BROTHER'S POTENTIAL. DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE HE'LL BECOME THE SAVIOR OF ASSIAH? I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BELIEVE IT. IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO CONVINCE THE VATICAN OF THE VALUE OF RIN'S LIFE. IT'S A RECKLESS WAGER. THE GRIGORI HAVE ISSUED TWO CONDITIONS... WHICH WE MUST ADHERE TO BY ANY AND ALL MEANS POSSIBLE. THE EXORCIST AUTHORIZATION EXAM IN SIX MONTHS' TIME. FIRST, WE MUST ENSURE HE PASSES IMPOSSIBLE. SECOND, TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST POTENTIAL FLARE-UPS, WE MUST KEEP HIM UNDER 24-HOUR SURVEILLANCE. I SAY "WE," BUT ACTUALLY THAT DUTY IS YOURS. ALONG WITH MS. KIRIGAKURE. THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE. EVEN SO, THERE'S NO CHOICE BUT TO PLAY THIS OUT. THE GAME HAS ALREADY BEGUN, HAS IT NOT, GOOD SIR? [ WARBLING ] [ CELL PHONE VIBRATES ] CAN'T COUNT ON ANYONE, CAN I? [ YOSHIKUNI ] I DID THE BEST I COULD TO FIX IT FOR NOW. HOWEVER, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN FIX IT AGAIN. IN KURIKARA IS CRAZY. IF YOU ASK ME, SEALING A DEMON'S POWER SO IF IT GETS DAMAGED AGAIN, IT WON'T BE COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY. THE KOMA SWORD WAS FORGED BY MY ANCESTORS... AND USED AGAINST THE DEMONS THAT TERRORIZED KYOTO LONG AGO. PLEASE TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT. RIN, IT'S GETTING LATE. HUH? [ KURO ] OH, CRAP. HOLD THE FORT DOWN FOR ME, OKAY? HAVE A GOOD DAY. [ SHIMA ] THIS SUCKS. WHY ARE THEY MAKING US DO THIS ON THE LAST DAY OF SUMMER VACATION? AND START SWINGING THAT NET, SHIMA. QUIT WHINING KONEKOMARU, WE'RE GOOD HERE. I THINK MAYBE MORIYAMA MIGHT NEED YOUR HELP MORE. OKAY. OH. NO, WE'RE FINE. WE CAN HANDLE IT. I BET YOUR ARM STILL HURTS. WHY DON'T YOU RELAX FOR A BIT? UH, SURE. I'LL TAKE A BREAK TOO. NO, YOU NEED TO WORK HARDER. BUT I SORT OF GOT HIT IN THE RIBS, REMEMBER? SO--- WHAT UP, GUYS? [ GASPS ] - HUH? - GOOD MORNING, RIN. UH, MORNING. I STOPPED BY THE CLASSROOM OUT OF HABIT, BUT YOU GUYS WEREN'T THERE. I SORTA GOT FREAKED OUT. SO WE'RE EXTERMINATING COAL TARS? MAN, THEY LOVE STICKING US WITH THESE LAME JOBS, DON'T THEY? ANYONE GOT AN EXTRA DUST RAG? I DON'T. UH, MAYBE THERE'S ONE OVER THERE. I'LL TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE. - I CAN GIVE YOU A HAND WITH THAT. - NO. I CAN DO IT MYSELF. UH, HEY, WAIT UP, MAN. [ GASPS ] [ KAMIKI ] OH, HE'S BEING A CHICKEN... BECAUSE YOU'RE THE CHILD OF A DEMON, AND NOT JUST ANY DEMON, BUT SATAN, WHO IN ONE NIGHT SLAUGHTERED EXORCISTS THE WORLD OVER. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE YOU EXPOSE... YOUR TRUE NATURE AND BECOME A THREAT. [ GASPS ] [ SIGHS ] [ CLEARS THROAT ] [ HUFFS ] [ GRUNTS ] [ GASPS ] [ CRASHING ] [ SHRIEKS ] SHIEMI! MORIYAMA? [ RIN ] [ SUGURO ] THEY'RE IN THE AIR DUCTS! DON'T BREATHE. YOUR LUNGS WILL ROT IF THEY GET IN. GET THE HELL AWAY FROM HER! [ SHIEMI SCREAMING ] OH, MORIYAMA! HUH? HE'S NOT HOT. YOU TRYING TO BURN HER ALIVE OR SOMETHING. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? HUH? THOSE BLUE FLAMES OF YOURS KILL PEOPLE. MY GRANDPA. SHIMA'S OLDEST BROTHER. KONEKOMARU'S MOM AND DAD. THEY WERE ALL KILLED THE SAME WAY BY YOUR FATHER, SATAN! UH-- OH. [ MIWA ] SIXTEEN YEARS AGO, SATAN CROSSED THE BARRIER TO OUR WORLD... AND MASSACRED ALL THE TOP CLERGYMEN. WE'VE CALLED IT THE BLUE NIGHT EVER SINCE. [ RIN, THINKING ] SO THAT NIGHT, THEIR FAMILIES WERE KILLED TOO? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE VATICAN DECIDED TO DO WITH YOU, BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW, WE'RE NOT YOUR FRIENDS ANYMORE. [ GASPS ] I'M WARNING YOU. IF YOU GO NUTS AND HURT EVEN ONE OF MY FRIENDS, I SWEAR I'LL KILL YOU. YOU GOT THAT? BUT I-- I'M NOT GONNA BE LIKE SATAN. YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME. [ YUKIO ] ALL RIGHT. ENOUGH. YUKIO. OKUMURA, YOU'RE COMING WITH ME. YOU'RE GOING TO BE STARTING A NEW CURRICULUM TODAY. AND AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, PLEASE CONTINUE YOUR WORK. [ GASPS ] HEY! I'M NOT DONE TALKING YET. - RIN. - LET GO, YOU FOUR-EYED MOLE FACE. DAMN IT. WHY DO I HAVE TO TAKE THESE CLASSES BY MYSELF? LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO SCREW AROUND ANYMORE. UNTIL YOU QUALIFY AS AN EXORCIST, YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN SERIOUS TRAINING MODE. SO YOU BETTER GET USED TO IT. - WHAT THE HELL IS ALL THIS? SOME KIND OF BATTING CAGE? - [ BEEPING ] [ COMPUTERIZED WOMAN'S VOICE ] YOU HAVE SELECTED BEGINNER'S MODE. ARE YOU LISTENING, RIN? [ SIGHS ] YOU HAVE SIX MONTHS TO PASS THE EXORCIST AUTHORIZATION EXAM. YEAH, I KNOW. OR THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME. [ BEEPING ] TRAINING WILL NOW BEGIN. AH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I BET I CAN PASS THE EXAM... WITHOUT HAVING TO DO ALL THIS TRAINING CRAP ANYWAY. I'VE ALREADY ANNIHILATED A BOATLOAD OF DEMONS, SO I'M SET. OH, YEAH? WASN'T THAT JUST DUMB LUCK? DUMB? [ SHOUTS ] [ GROANING ] YOU JUST TOLD SUGURO TO TRUST YOU. OR WAS I HEARING THINGS? SO? WHAT IF I DID? [ GASPS ] SOMEONE'S TRUST, YOU HAVE TO PROVE YOURSELF TO THEM. IF YOU WANNA EARN AND THE WAY THINGS ARE, YOU'VE GOT A LOT LEFT TO PROVE TO EVERYONE. YEAH? LIKE WHAT? [ SHURA ] THE FOUR-EYED CHICKEN'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. [ YUKIO ] SHURA. [ RIN ] WHAT'S WITH THAT OUTFIT? IT'S CALLED ECO FRIENDLY. [ THINKING ] ECO FRIENDLY? YOU JUST SHOWED UP IN YOUR PAJAMAS. SINCE YOU'RE THE SPAWN OF SATAN AND ALL, YOU'RE KINDA LIKE A DEMONIC THOROUGHBRED. THE ONLY REASON YOU MANAGED TO GET BY TILL NOW IS 'CAUSE OF ALL THAT UNTAPPED POTENTIAL. THAT'S IT. AND EVEN WITH ALL THAT POTENTIAL, YOU STILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTROL THOSE POWERS. TILL THEN, YOU GOT NO CHANCE OF BECOMING AN EXORCIST, NEVER MIND A PALADIN. WELL, THEN WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? TRAIN YOUR ASS OFF, NATCH. - HERE. - [ GASPS ] A CANDLE? THREE OF THOSE CANDLES SIDE BY SIDE, DUH. OKAY, FIRST, LINE UP AND TRY TO LIGHT THE ONES ON EACH END AT THE SAME TIME. GOT IT. [ GRUNTING ] [ GASPS ] LIGHT THEM, NOT ENGULF THEM IN YOUR UNGODLY HELL FIRE. YEAH, I'LL TRY IT AGAIN. REALLY? UH, THAT'S THE MIDDLE ONE, DUMBASS. I SAID LIGHT 'EM AT THE SAME TIME. - [ SHOUTING ] - YOU'RE SO SLOPPY, SLOPPY DOESN'T EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE YOU. BUT THIS IS REALLY HARD. BOO-FRICKIN'-HOO. YOU'RE DOING THREE SETS A DAY FOR AN HOUR EACH. I WANT YOU TO KEEP AT IT TILL YOU CAN DO IT EVEN WHILE YOU'RE PICKING YOUR NOSE. HUH? THAT'S MY TRAINING? WH-WHAT ABOUT MY SWORD? [ SIGHS ] DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA... WHY YOU LOST CONTROL OF YOURSELF DURING YOUR FIGHT WITH AMAIMON? UH-UH. NOT A CLUE. YOU LOST IT 'CAUSE YOU CHICKENED OUT, THAT'S WHY. IT'S WHY YOUR FLAMES CONSUME YOU. GET USED TO YOUR FLAMES, BUILD UP YOUR CONFIDENCE. THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE KOMA SWORD. [ THINKING ] IT PISSES ME OFF, BUT SHE'S RIGHT, DAMN IT. OKAY. I GOT THIS. [ GASPS, GROANS ] I WONDER IF THE KID'S EVER GONNA GET IT. [ RIN GRUNTING ] HUH? YOU LOOK ALL GLOOMY AS USUAL. YOU KNOW, YOU KEEP HANGING ON TO THAT STRESS, YOU'RE GONNA GET AN ULCER. AND WHOSE FAULT WOULD THAT BE? I GOT AN IDEA, MR. FOUR-EYED CHICKEN. HOW ABOUT WE TAKE THE EDGE OFF EXORCIST STYLE? - PASS. - HOLY CRAP, THAT WAS FAST. YOU'RE SO ANTISOCIAL. ON THESE MATCHES? REMEMBER THE DAYS WE USED TO BET EACH OTHER LUNCH WHOO-HOO! SIXTEEN WINS IN A ROW FOR ME! [ LAUGHING ] [ GROANS ] HEY, SHURA, IT'S NOT COOL TO GO ALL OUT AGAINST A MIDDLE SCHOOLER. HOW BRUTAL THE COMPETITION CAN BE IN THE REAL WORLD. RELAX. I WAS JUST SHOWING HIM YO, CHICKEN, YOU LOST TODAY, SO YOU'RE BUYING ME LUNCH TOMORROW. OKAY, WHATEVER. JUST STOP CALLING ME CHICKEN ALREADY. [ LAUGHS ] YOU KNOW, YUKIO, YOU'RE TOTALLY GETTING PLAYED BY HER. - BULLSHIT. - [ GASPS ] DID YOU JUST SAY "BULLSHIT"? UNBELIEVABLE. I REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT GIRL ONE BIT. SHE'S GOT ALL THAT TALENT, BUT SHE'S ALWAYS SLACKING OFF. SHE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT FOR STUDYING SO HARD. THERE'S TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY, SON. EVEN THOUGH SHE DOESN'T ACT LIKE IT, SHE WORKS HER BUTT OFF JUST LIKE YOU. OKAY, I'M IN. HOWEVER, IF I WIN, YOU HAVE TO STOP CALLING ME "FOUR-EYED CHICKEN," YOU GOT THAT? HMM. SURE. SAME RULES AS BEFORE. WE ROCK INFINITY MODE, AND THE FIRST ONE WHO LOSES THEIR CONCENTRATION LOSES THE BET. SOUND GOOD? I CAN LIVE WITH THAT. [ BEEPING ] YOU HAVE SELECTED SPECIAL INFINITY MODE. TRAINING WILL NOW BEGIN. HOLY CRAP! THOSE THINGS ARE GOING SO FAST, BUT THEY'RE SMASHING EVERY ONE OF 'EM LIKE IT'S NO BIG DEAL. THOSE GUYS ARE MACHINES. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? GO FOCUS ON YOUR CANDLES, KID. ACTUALLY, SHURA, YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE FOCUSING. DON'T GIVE ME YOUR LIP, CHICKEN. KEEP SHOOTING. HE'S BEHIND THE PILLAR ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE TRAINING ROOM. EVEN THOUGH HE'S KEEPING HIMSELF HIDDEN, YOU CAN SEE HIM, YEAH? - IS HE WORKING FOR THE VATICAN? - UH-HUH. BUT RIN'S NOT THE ONLY ONE HE'S KEEPING AN EYE ON. - HE'S WATCHING YOU. - WHY WOULD THE GRIGORI DO THAT? THEY ORDERED ME TO WATCH RIN. THEY TRUST ME. [ SHURA ] BUT YOU'RE THE SON OF SATAN TOO. TO THE VATICAN, YOU'RE AS MUCH OF A THREAT TO THEM AS YOUR BROTHER. I'M NOTHING LIKE MY BROTHER. IN CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED, I DON'T HAVE HIS POWERS. IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT, HOW COME YOU GET YOURSELF CHECKED OUT EVERY DAY? IT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID, THAT'S WHY. YOU THINK THE DAY IS GONNA COME WHEN YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF WITH THE SAME DEMONIC POWER AS RIN. - THAT'S RIDICULOUS. - OR MAYBE IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND. MAYBE YOU WANNA HAVE THAT POWER ALL FOR YOURSELF. NICE TRY, BUT YOU CAN'T DISTRACT ME BY MESSING WITH MY HEAD LIKE THAT. I HOPE THAT'S TRUE. WATCH OUT. YOU'RE THE TYPE WHO GETS POSSESSED BY DEMONS EASY. I CAN TELL. WHAT? [ THINKING ] IS THAT HOW GOOD A PRO'S SUPPOSED TO BE? MAN, IT TOOK EVERYTHING I HAD JUST TO HIT A COUPLE OF THEM IN BEGINNER MODE. [ GRUNTS ] SHIT! - WHAT THE HELL? - WHAT'S GOING ON? [ STAMMERING ] UH-- WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO US, RIN? HUH? SORRY. MY BAD. HOLD UP THOUGH. YOUR CLOTHES BURNED OFF, BUT NOT YOUR UNDERWEAR OR SKIN. YOU SEE? THAT PROVES I CAN CONTROL MY POWER. THE HELL YOU CAN. YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. [ GIGGLES ] I'LL GET THE HOLY WATER. THANKS. THAT'D BE GREAT. [ SUGURO ] FOR BY HIM, ALL THINGS WERE CREATED. THINGS IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH-- STILL STUDYING? SORRY ABOUT THAT, MAN. DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE YOU. I JUST GOT UP TO USE THE RESTROOM. YOU SHOULD TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP, THOUGH, OR YOU'LL BURN YOURSELF OUT. BUT I DON'T WANNA LOSE. [ GASPS ] TO WHOM? KAMIKI? NO, YOU DUMMY. I MEAN TO OKUMURA. YOU'RE WAY AHEAD OF HIM. YOU'RE THE TOP STUDENT... IN PHARMACOLOGY AND SCRIPTURE RECITATION. YEAH, BUT STRAIGHT A'S AREN'T GONNA HELP ANYONE IN REAL-WORLD COMBAT. [ SIGHS ] THAT HIT HOME AFTER OUR CAMPING TRIP. [ SIGHS ] BON-- I PROMISE I'M GONNA BECOME A FULL-FLEDGED EXORCIST AS SOON AS I CAN. OTHERWISE I WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD MY HEAD UP TO YOUR MOM AND DAD. [ MIWA ] RIGHT. BON IS SO STRONG. EVEN AFTER WHAT WE SAW, HE STILL THINKS OKUMURA IS HIS RIVAL, WHILE I CAN'T EVEN BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS HE IS. [ MALE VOICE ] ARE YOU AFRAID? [ GASPS ] YOU'LL END UP LOSING THEM AGAIN-- YOUR LOVED ONES; THOSE DEAR TO YOU. NOW THEN, ACCEPT ME. WHO ARE YOU? ACCEPT THIS FEAR. [ GASPS ] [ RIN GRUNTING ] OH, COME ON, MAN! WHY CAN'T I MAKE IT DO WHAT I WANT IT TO? OH, I GUESS I DON'T HAVE THE TALENT FOR IT. [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] UH, WHO'S THERE? IT'S ME WONDERING WHY YOU'RE SITTING THERE TALKING TO YOURSELF. I WASN'T. ANYWAY, WHY ARE YOU SNEAKING AROUND HERE THIS EARLY IN THE MORNING? I'M NOT SNEAKING. I JUST FORGOT MY PENCIL CASE. UH-- OH. WHAT KIND OF TRAINING IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE? OH. I HAVE TO LIGHT THE CANDLES ON THE ENDS, NOT THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE, BUT IT'S NOT WORKING OUT SO HOT FOR ME. THAT REMINDS ME. REMEMBER WHEN PAKO GOT ATTACKED BY THAT GHOUL? YEAH. DURING THAT BOOT CAMP THING. THAT DAY MY FAMILIARS WOULDN'T OBEY ME BECAUSE I WAS SCARED. I LOST MY CONFIDENCE. AND I LOST CONTROL. YOUR FLAMES WORK THE SAME WAY. BE CONFIDENT, AND I'M SURE THEY'LL OBEY YOU. DON'T BE AFRAID. THAT MAKES SENSE. HEY, WHY'D YOU DO THAT? WHAT? YOU GAVE ME GOOD ADVICE. WHY'D YOU GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO TELL ME ALL THAT STUFF? I MEAN, AREN'T YOU SCARED OF ME LIKE EVERYONE ELSE? NOT REALLY. I GUESS YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS, BUT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT THAT UNUSUAL... FOR DEMONS AND HUMANS TO HAVE BLOOD TIES WITH EACH OTHER. AND FOR EXORCISTS, IT'S PRETTY COMMON. [ GASPS ] NO WAY. YOU'RE KIDDING. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. AND NOW THAT YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ALL MOPEY AND STRESS OUT ABOUT YOUR BLOODLINE ANYMORE. IF PEOPLE WANNA MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT, THEN YOU CAN... TELL 'EM-- THANKS, POLKA BROW! HUH? YOU'RE A PRETTY RAD PERSON AFTER ALL. YOU CALLED ME POLKA BROW? DON'T YOU GIVE ME WEIRD NICKNAMES. I HAVE A PROPER NAME. IT'S IZUMO KAMIKI, GOT THAT? I REALLY APPRECIATE IT, IZUMO. THANKS TO YOU, I THINK I CAN DO THIS. [ HUFFS ] WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I CAME HERE WANTING TO GIVE YOU A PEP TALK. [ WIND BLOWING ] WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S COMING. [ GRUNTS ] SHOW YOURSELF! [ GASPS ] ♪♪ [ WOMAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] [ MIWA ] IT'S OKUMURA. HE JUST CAME AFTER ME. [ SUGURO ] IF YOU EVER HURT ANY OF MY FRIENDS, I SWORE I'D KILL YOU. [ YUKIO ] CONTROL YOURSELF. IF YOU GO ON ANOTHER RAMPAGE, THEY'RE GO-- [ SUGURO ] KONEKOMARU!
