 AND MAKE SOME NEW FRIENDS. MISS KAMIKI, MISS PAKU. HELLO. I WAS WONDERING-- [ SHRIEKS ] OW. THAT HURT. MISS MORIYAMA? YOU KLUTZ. [ WHIMPERS ] ARE YOU OKAY? MM-HMM. TRY TO BE MORE CAREFUL. WAIT UP, IZUMO. [ RIN ] SHIEMI? EVERYTHING OKAY? WHAT YOU DOING DOWN THERE? UM, NOTHING. I'M FINE. I CAN'T DEPEND ON RIN. I'VE GOT TO DO THIS ON MY OWN. ♪♪ [ MAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] LISTEN UP. SUMMER VACATION IS LESS THAN A MONTH AND A HALF AWAY, BUT BEFORE THE BREAK, YOU'RE GOING TO BE TAKING... THIS YEAR'S EXWIRE AUTHORIZATION EXAM. ESQUIRE EXAM? WHAT THE HECK'S THAT? NO, EXWIRE. HUH? A CANDIDATE FOR BECOMING AN EXORCIST. HUH. I WANT EVERYONE TO KEEP IN MIND... THAT ONCE YOU'RE PROMOTED TO EXWIRE... YOU'LL BE SUBJECTED TO MORE SPECIALIZED COMBAT TRAINING. THE EXAM WON'T BE EASY TO PASS, THEREFORE, STARTING MONDAY, WE'RE OFFERING A WEEKLONG BOOT CAMP TO PREPARE YOU FOR THE EXAM. A BOOT CAMP? SINCE ATTENDING THE CAMP ISN'T MANDATORY, INDICATE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'LL BE PARTICIPATING ON THE FORM. IF YOU ARE, PLEASE INDICATE THE MEISTER, OR TITLE, THAT YOU'D LIKE TO ACQUIRE, AND TURN THE FORM IN BY MONDAY. A MEISTER OR A TITLE? HEY, COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT A MEISTER IS? HUH? UH, COME ON. HELP ME OUT HERE. PLEASE. GIVE ME A BREAK. YOU WANT TO BE AN EXORCIST, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS? SERIOUSLY, WHAT'S WITH YOU? [ CHUCKLES ] YOU REALLY ARE TOTALLY CLUELESS, - AREN'T YOU, OKUMURA? - FINE. I DON'T HAVE A CLUE. SO ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME OR WHAT? I'LL TELL YOU. IT'S A TECHNICAL QUALIFICATION... THAT'S REQUIRED TO BECOME AN EXORCIST. WHO'VE PROVED THEY'VE GOT GREAT SKILLS. IT'S A TITLE GIVEN TO THOSE THERE ARE FIVE MEISTERS IN ALL. KNIGHT, DRAGOON, TAMER, ARIA AND DOCTOR. AS LONG AS YOU'VE ACQUIRED AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE, YOU CAN BECOME AN EXORCIST. OH, OKAY. I THINK I GET IT NOW. NO ONE SAID YOU COULD SIT WITH US. THE OTHER THING IS, YOUR STYLE OF COMBAT WILL DIFFER... DEPENDING ON WHICH MEISTER YOU ARE. SWEET. THANKS FOR EXPLAINING, KONEKOMARU. WHICH ONE ARE YOU GOING FOR? WELL, SHIMA AND I ARE GOING TO TRY FOR ARIA. HMM? ARIA? ARIA'S A MEISTER THAT BATTLES DEMONS... BY RECITING PASSAGES FROM THE BIBLE AND OTHER SACRED SCRIPTURES. BON HERE'S GONNA GO FOR BOTH ARIA AND DRAGOON... 'CAUSE HE'S ALL HARD CORE AND EVERYTHING. WOW. THAT'S OUR BON. DO NOT CALL ME BON! ACTUALLY, OUR INSTRUCTOR, MR. OKUMURA, HAS TWO MEISTERS-- DOCTOR AND DRAGOON. HUH. YUKIO KICKS BUTT. HMM. I WONDER WHICH OF THOSE I SHOULD GO FOR. THIS DRAGOON-- WHAT IS IT? [ LOUD THUMP ] HUH? MY GOD! YOU ARE SUCH A PAIN. A DRAGOON'S A MEISTER WHO FIGHTS WITH FIREARMS. AND A KNIGHT'S A MEISTER WHO FIGHTS WITH A FRIGGIN' SWORD. [ SHIMA CHUCKLES ] SEE? EVEN WITH ALL THE GRUMBLING, BON CAN STILL BE HELPFUL. [ SUGURO ] SHUT UP! - BACK UP. YOU SAY SWORD? - MM-HMM. IN SWORD FIGHTING ARE CALLED KNIGHTS. THE MEISTERS WHO SPECIALIZE OKAY. THEN I'M GONNA BE A KNIGHT. YEAH, YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS SEE YOU CARRYING THAT SWORD AROUND. YEP. IT'S SORT OF LIKE A KEEPSAKE FROM MY DAD. RIN SEEMS LIKE HE'S HAPPIER WHEN HE'S HANGING OUT WITH THE OTHER BOYS. I'VE GOT TO BE STRONG THOUGH. BUT WHAT SHOULD I DO? RIN AND YUKI HELPED ME GET IN HERE. NO. IT'S NOT THEIR JOB TO TAKE CARE OF ME. IT'S MINE. ALL RIGHT. I WILL NOW SUMMON A DEMON. - WHOA. - WATCH YOUR STEP. IF THE MAGIC CIRCLE IS BROKEN, IT WILL LOSE ITS EFFECT. NOW, TO SUMMON A DEMON, YOU'LL NEED A DROP OF YOUR BLOOD... AND A SUITABLE INVOCATION. SON OF TYPHOEUS AND ECHIDNA, HEAR MY CALL AND SHOW YOURSELF. [ GASPING ] [ LOW GROANING ] IS THAT A NABERIUS? I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE. EW, SULFUR. SUMMONING A DEMON TO USE AS A FAMILIAR IS A RARE TRAIT. NOT EVERYONE IS CAPABLE. NOW, TO TAME A DEMON, YOU MUST HAVE A STRONG WILL AND UNSHAKABLE NERVE. HAVING A NATURAL TALENT FOR IT IS ALSO VALUABLE. HUH? TODAY I'M GOING TO TEST YOU... TO SEE IF ANYONE HERE HAS THIS TALENT. - A TEST? - AT THE BEGINNING OF CLASS, I HANDED OUT PIECES OF PAPER WITH A COPY OF THE MAGIC CIRCLE. PLACE A DROP OF BLOOD ON IT AND CHANT WHATEVER WORDS MAY COME TO MIND. I HUMBLY APPEAL TO THEE, OH GODDESS INARI. GRANT MY REQUEST. LEAVE NOT MY PRAYERS TO THEE UNFULFILLED. WHOA! THAT'S SO UNBELIEVABLY COOL. A PAIR OF WHITE FOXES. NICELY DONE, MISS KAMIKI. IZUMO, THAT'S AMAZING. I TRIED, BUT I DIDN'T GET ANYTHING. THAT FIGURES. I COME FROM A LONG LINE OF SHRINE MAIDENS. THIS ISN'T WORKING. I CAN'T DO IT. ME NEITHER. HMM. MISS KAMIKI'S AMAZING. HERE GOES. UM, I'D LIKE TO TRY IT NEXT. COME ON, BOY. OR SOMETHING. HMM. NEE! NEE! IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, THAT LOOKS LIKE A BABY GREENMAN. EXCELLENT, MISS MORIYAMA. EXCELLENT. [ HUFFS ] N-NICE TO MEET YOU. NEE! NEE. [ GIGGLES ] THIS IS MY CHANCE TO TALK TO HER. UM, HEY, MISS KAMIKI? I-I SUMMONED MY FAMILIAR TOO. ADORABLE. IT'S LIKE SO UNBELIEVABLY TINY... AND RIDICULOUSLY CUTE, LIKE A PEANUT. HUH? REALLY? YOU THINK HE'S CUTE? OH, THANK YOU. LOOKS AS THOUGH WE HAVE OUR TAMER CANDIDATES FOR THIS CLASS. NOW THEN, TAMERS ARE VALUABLE IN COMBAT. THE ABILITY TO CONTROL DEMONS IS EXTREMELY RARE AMONG EXORCISTS. A DEMON WILL NOT OBEY IF IT PERCEIVES ITS MASTER TO BE WEAK. IF ITS MASTER LACKS WILLPOWER, THE DEMON WILL ATTACK THEM. OH. NEE! WE'RE OKAY, RIGHT? AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, ONCE YOU BREAK THE CIRCLE, YOU RELEASE THE FAMILIAR FROM YOUR CONTROL AND IT VANISHES. SO IF YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN DANGER, SIMPLY TEAR UP THE PAPER. [ ALL GASP ] [ CLOCK CHIMES ] THAT'S ALL FOR TODAY. CLASS DISMISSED. NEE? I WON'T MAKE YOU DISAPPEAR, I PROMISE. IS IT OKAY IF I CALL YOU NEE? NEE. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. UH, S-SURE. HEY, MISS KAMIKI? UM-- IZUMO, SHE'S CALLING YOU. IGNORE HER, PAKU. KEEP WALKING. THAT GIRL'S SO ANNOYING. [ SHIEMI ] WAIT UP! WAIT! WAIT! WAIT! WAIT! WAIT! WAIT! [ GROWLS ] WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME AROUND? OKAY, YOU SUMMONED A FAMILIAR. BIG DEAL. DO YOU THINK THAT MAKES YOU SPECIAL NOW? HUH? UM, I JUST-- UM, I, UH-- I'D LIKE... TO-- TO-- WOULD YOU PLEASE BE MY FRIEND? OH. HUH? YOU SEE, I, UH, I'VE NEVER HAD ANY FRIENDS BEFORE. SO, UM-- HMM. - ALL RIGHT THEN. - HUH? I SAID ALL RIGHT. WE'LL BE FRIENDS FROM NOW ON. REALLY? [ CHUCKLES ] - I'M SO HAPPY. - GOOD. HANG ON TO THIS FOR ME, OKAY? I GET TIRED EASY 'CAUSE I'M NOT THAT STRONG. AFTER ALL, FRIENDS ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP EACH OTHER OUT. THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR, RIGHT? FRIENDS HELP EACH OTHER. [ GIGGLES ] IZUMO, ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? SHE SEEMS HAPPY ENOUGH, SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? HUH? WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? SHIEMI'S CARRYING POLKA BROW'S STUFF LIKE SHE'S HER MAID OR SOMETHING. POLKA BROW? [ LAUGHS ] HE MEANS MISS KAMIKI. [ SUGURO ] THEY'RE JUST MESSING AROUND. HERE. PASS THESE OUT FOR ME, WILL YOU? UH-HUH. WE'RE USING VALERIANA IN OUR NEXT PHARMACEUTICS CLASS. MAKE SURE AND GET ME SOME, OKAY? UH-HUH. MELON BREAD AND FRUIT MILK. GOT IT? UH-HUH. UNBELIEVABLE. POOR SHIEMI. SHE'S RUNNING AROUND LIKE AN ERRAND GIRL. WHAT? YEAH. NOTHING. SO WHY ARE WE HAVING BOOT CAMP IN OUR DORM ANYWAY? AND BESIDES, WE'RE THE ONLY ONES LIVING HERE... IT'S CONVENIENT, SO WE WON'T BE DISTURBING ANYONE. IT'S GOING TO BE FINE. HUH? GOOD MORNING. YOUR CLASS HAS ARRIVED. [ YUKIO ] GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. SERIOUSLY? THIS THING LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A HORROR MOVIE. WOW, IT'S SO CREEPY. AND UGLY. WAS THIS THE BEST PLACE WE COULD FIND TO DO THIS? OH. TAKE IT. UH-HUH. [ GROWLS ] MISS MORIYAMA, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, JUST SAY SO. HUH? OH, NO, I DON'T MIND AT ALL. I'M JUST HELPING OUT A FRIEND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR. UH, OKAY. TIME'S UP. TURN YOUR PAPERS OVER AND HAND THEM IN, PLEASE. [ ALL GRUMBLING ] WHEW. THANK GOD IT'S OVER. THAT TOOK FOREVER. I'M GONNA GO GET SOME AIR. LATER. YEAH, GOOD IDEA. I WANT EVERYONE UP BY 6:00 A.M. TOMORROW. THAT'LL GIVE US AN HOUR BEFORE WE START CLASS... TO GO OVER THE ANSWERS TO THE TEST. [ GROANS ] DEMON. SADIST. PAKU, LET'S GO TAKE A BATH. MM-HMM. OH, I WANNA GO. [ PAKU ] I HOPE THE BATHTUB'S BIG. [ KAMIKI ] I DON'T CARE. I JUST WANNA SOAK. [ PAKU ] YOU'VE ALWAYS LOVED TAKING A BATH. [ KAMIKI ] WELL, OF COURSE. I AM A GIRL. TOGETHER. [ LAUGHS ] THREE GIRLS TAKING A BATH. WHAT DO YOU SAY, GUYS, WE BUST ASS OVER THERE AND HAVE OURSELVES A PEEK? HELLO? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A MONK, SHIMA. YOU'RE GETTING BACK INTO YOUR BAD HABITS AGAIN. YOU GUYS ARE BOTH JUST AS INTERESTED AS I AM. AW, SHUT IT. [ YUKIO ] EXCUSE ME. YOUR TEACHER'S SITTING RIGHT HERE. COME ON, LOOSEN UP A LITTLE. YOU MIGHT BE OUR TEACHER, BUT YOU'RE ALSO A FRESHMAN, JUST LIKE US. IT'S MY POLICY NOT TO ENGAGE IN FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS. UH. [ PAKU ] THIS IS IT. WOW. THIS IS GREAT! I'VE NEVER TAKEN A BATH WITH FRIENDS BEFORE. - OH, SORRY. - HMM? COULD YOU WAIT OUT HERE? - WELL, CAN'T I COME IN? - NO, YOU CAN'T. I'M SHY, AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE ME NAKED. IF YOU WERE MY FRIEND, YOU'D UNDERSTAND. HUH? OH, I KNOW. INSTEAD OF WAITING OUT HERE, GO TO THE STORE AND BUY ME SOME FRUIT MILK. I WANT TO DRINK IT AFTER MY BATH. [ FOOTSTEPS RECEDING ] MM-HMM. 'KAY. THANKS. HEY, WHAT YOU DOING? SOME FRUIT MILK. OH, NOTHING. JUST GOING TO GO GET HEY! [ GASPS ] LISTEN, STOP DOING THAT. DOING WHAT? THAT! ACTING LIKE HER ERRAND GIRL. STOP IT. I'M JUST HELPING OUT MY FRIEND. I'M NOT HER ERRAND GIRL. YOU BELIEVE THAT? DO YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON? YOU KNOW YOU DON'T. I-- I'M TIRED OF BEING THE ONE WHO ALWAYS NEEDS HELP. ALWAYS HIDING BEHIND OTHERS. I JUST WANT TO-- TO BE LIKE YOU AND YUKI. TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO HELP SOMEONE OUT FOR A CHANGE. SHE IS THE FIRST FRIEND I'VE EVER HAD IN MY WHOLE LIFE. YOU DON'T GET IT 'CAUSE YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN STRONG. YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD FRIENDS. UH, HEY, HOLD UP. UH. [ SHOUTS ] THANK GOODNESS. AT LEAST THE BATHTUB'S CLEAN. IT'S LIKE THE HAUNTED MANSION IN HERE. AM I RIGHT? HEY, IZUMO? HMM? WHY ARE YOU BEING MEAN TO HER? HUH? WELL, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S REALLY MY FRIEND OR ANYTHING. IF SHE WANTS TO DO WHATEVER I TELL HER TO, HEY, THAT'S HER DEAL. OH, BUT YOU'RE DIFFERENT. YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND IN THE WHOLE WORLD. WHEN YOU DECIDED TO COME TO THE CRAM SCHOOL, I WAS SO HAPPY. WE'RE GONNA HAVE SO MUCH FUN. BUT I'M BARELY KEEPING UP ON ALL THE CLASSES AS IT IS. DON'T WORRY. I PROMISE I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU. DID YOU HEAR? KAMIKI FREAKED OUT AGAIN. SHE SAYS SHE SAW A GHOST. SHE'S CREEPY. I BET SHE'S LYING. SHE'S GOT NO FRIENDS AND JUST WANTS ATTENTION. YEAH, SHE'S A LONER. [ ALL GIGGLING ] WAIT UP, MISS KAMIKI. I'M ON THE COMMITTEE TOO. LET ME HELP YOU. IF YOU HANG AROUND ME, MISS PAKU, THEY'RE JUST GONNA MAKE FUN OF YOU TOO. HUH? [ LAUGHS ] LIKE ANYONE CARES WHAT THEY SAY. I'M NOT VERY NICE. JUST SAYIN'. [ GIGGLES ] ALL YOU HAVE TO DO, PAKU, IS STICK WITH ME, AND YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT. LISTEN, IZUMO? HMM? I THINK I SHOULD QUIT GOING TO CRAM SCHOOL. WHAT? I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE CLASSES, AND-- AND I CAN'T SEE MYSELF RISKING MY LIFE IN BATTLE. BUT-- BUT I SAID I'D-- HMM-MM. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. BESIDES, I DON'T LIKE HOW YOU MAKE FUN OF THE PEOPLE IN CLASS WHO TRY TO DO THEIR BEST. I'M SORRY. I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU, BUT I COULDN'T. A REAL FRIEND WOULD'VE TOLD YOU EARLIER. THAT'S THE THING. SORRY. HUH? [ BOTH SCREAM ] [ GASPS ] HUH? THAT SOUNDS LIKE MISS KAMIKI AND MISS PAKU. I GOT THIS. GO TELL YUKIO. RIN'S SO AMAZING. HE DIDN'T HESITATE. HE JUST TOOK OFF. HOW CAN HE BE SO BRAVE? [ SCREAMING ] DON'T GO. DON'T LEAVE! I WANNA GO TOO! - [ GRUNTS ] - PAKU! A GHOUL'S TEMPTAINT HAS TO BE TREATED RIGHT AWAY... OR ELSE-- I HUMBLY APPEAL TO THEE, OH, GODDESS INARI. GRANT MY REQUEST. LEAVE NOT MY PRAYERS TO THEE UNFULFILLED. [ SNARLS ] WHAT DO I DO? I HAVE TO SAVE HER.

[ SNARLING ] IT LOOKS A LOT LIKE A BURN. [ KAMIKI ] IT'S A GHOUL'S TEMPTAINT. IT'LL GO NECROTIC SOON. THEN THERE'S NO TIME TO MOVE HER. I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING NOW. MY YOUNG PRINCE. [ GASPS, YELLS ] [ SHOUTING ] RIN! I'M OKAY. WHAT DO I DO? TO TREAT A BURN I'M GONNA NEED-- MR. SANCHO! HUH? WHERE AM I GONNA FIND SOME? NEE! - YEAH, NEE? - [ GRUNTING ] OH! NICE JOB, NEE. YOU BROUGHT ME SOME MR. SANCHO. NO, THAT'S AN ALOE VERA PLANT. WAIT. WHY IS ALOE VERA SPROUTING FROM YOUR FAMILIAR? [ ROARS ] [ GRUNTING ] FORGIVE ME. I ONLY DO... AS MY MASTER COMMANDS ME TO. HE MEAN SATAN? NO USE. I DON'T HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST HIM LIKE THIS. CAN'T HOLD ON. - [ YUKIO ] RIN! - [ GUNFIRE ] - GET BACK HERE. - [ GUNFIRE ] ARE YOU OKAY? ARE YOU HURT? YOU'RE LATE! BUT I STILL MADE IT, DIDN'T I? SHIEMI, HOW'S MISS PAKU? OKAY, I THINK. NEE. YOU DID GOOD. WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU HADN'T BEEN HERE. WHO KNOWS [ BOTH GASP ] MISS PAKU! [ GROANS ] MISS MORIYAMA? THANKS A LOT... FOR SAVING ME. UH-HUH. [ CRYING ] HMM? HEY, ARE YOU OKAY? DON'T LOOK AT ME! I'M SO ASHAMED. I DON'T WANT ANYONE SEEING ME LIKE THIS. I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. I COULDN'T EVEN HELP THE ONLY FRIEND I EVER HAD. AND NOW SHE HATES ME. JUST PUT IT ON AND GET GOING. [ FOOTSTEPS RECEDING ] [ GROWLING ] SO YOU FAILED. [ GROWLS ] WAS THAT A HOWL? OR PERHAPS YOU'RE AMUSED AT HOW FAR I'VE FALLEN TO BECOME A DEMON'S LAPDOG. ♪♪ [ MAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] WOULD YOU MIND EXPLAINING WHY YOU'RE NAKED? IT JUST HAPPENED? NEVER MIND. JUST GET EVERYONE OUT OF HERE. [ KAMIKI ] I'D RATHER DIE THAN BE FRIENDS WITH THESE LOSERS. [ SUGURO ] WITH A PERSONALITY LIKE THAT, NO WONDER YOU'RE ALL ALONE.
