 I TRUST YOU. NO, IT'S COOL. ANYWAY, I GOTTA GO TAKE HIM TO JAPAN BRANCH H.Q. I ALSO WANNA TALK TO MEPHISTO. IF HE'S GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT, DRAG HIM TO ME IF YOU HAVE TO. - YES. - COME ON, GET UP. [ GRUNTS ] I GOT A MILLION QUESTIONS, AND I'D BETTER LIKE YOUR ANSWERS. [ MUFFLED PROTESTS ] EXCUSE ME. RIN'S INJURED AND NEEDS TREATMENT. - CAN'T THIS WAIT A BIT? - [ RIN GRUNTING ] OH, DON'T YOU WORRY. HE'LL BE FINE. BUT, BABY, YOU SMELL LIKE MILK, SO CHILL OUT. I SMELL LIKE MILK? HOW LONG ARE WE GONNA WAIT? I HAVE NO IDEA. [ KAMIKI ] UH, SIR? [ SUGURO ] WHAT THE HECK'S GOING ON AROUND HERE? LISTEN UP, CLASS. TODAY'S MISSION IS OVER. YOU CAN ALL RETURN TO YOUR DORMS FOR NOW. [ RIN ] LET ME GO! I CAN'T BREATHE, DAMN IT! - [ GASPS ] - [ SHIMA ] WELL, THAT SUCKS. NOW I'M JEALOUS. [ MIWA ] SHIMA! [ SHIMA ] HOLD ON A SEC. WHO IS THAT HOTTIE? SHE'S WEARING PANTS FROM A BOY'S UNIFORM. [ MIWA ] COULD THAT BE YAMADA? NO WAY! [ SUGURO ] TYPICAL OKUMURA. GUY'S ALWAYS GETTING INTO A JAM. [ KAMIKI ] HEY, HOLD IT RIGHT THERE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON? ALL I KNOW IS IT'S NOT HIS FAULT. I'M NOT SURE YET. [ KAMIKI ] HUH? IS IT? [ RIN ] WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME? OH, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU NEVER HAD A REASON TO COME TO THE BASE BEFORE NOW. THE BASE? [ CREAKING ] [ DOOR CREAKING ] IS THIS IT? YEP. THIS IS THE JAPAN BRANCH OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE TRUE CROSS. [ GRUNTS ] THE MAIN HEADQUARTERS ARE IN THE VATICAN, RIGHT UNDERNEATH SAINT PIERRE PAULO'S BASILICA. ALL THE BRANCHES FROM ALL OVER THE GLOBE ARE RUN FROM THAT LOCATION. THE ORDER'S BEEN AROUND FOR MORE THAN 2,000 YEARS... PROTECTING THE WORLD FROM MONSTERS. OH. [ MEPHISTO ] QUITE TRUE. WELCOME TO THE JAPAN BRANCH OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE TRUE CROSS. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN AGES, SHURA. AND WHAT A SURPRISE IT IS TO FIND THAT YOU'D INFILTRATED OUR CRAM SCHOOL TO SPY ON US. YOUR DISGUISE WAS INSPIRED. I HAD NO CLUE. MEPHISTO, HOW ABOUT WE CUT TO THE CHASE? WHY'D YOU HIDE THE EXISTENCE OF THE SON OF SATAN FROM THE ORDER? I DIDN'T HIDE ANYTHING FROM ANYONE. YES, I TOOK HIM IN, BUT IT WAS ALL FOR THE SAKE OF THE ORDER AND ITS FUTURE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? WE TRAIN THE SON OF SATAN AND USE HIM AS A WEAPON FOR THE ORDER. LOOK, FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS, WE EXORCISTS HAVE BEEN ON THE DEFENSIVE. BUT WITH HIM, NOW WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE. YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION, SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU ONE MORE TIME-- WHY DIDN'T YOU REPORT THIS TO THE VATICAN? WELL, LOOK AT HIM. HIS POWER ISN'T AT ITS FULL POTENTIAL. YOU KNOW THE GRIGORI WOULD NEVER BE CONVINCED BY A HALF-FINISHED PROJECT. ONE MORE QUESTION. WAS SHIRO FUJIMOTO ALSO INVOLVED IN THIS SCHEME OF YOURS? I SWEAR, THERE'S NO SCHEME. FUJIMOTO RAISED HIM UNTIL THE BOY BECAME AWARE OF HIS POWER. ALL I'M DOING IS ACTING AS HIS GUARDIAN. I SEE. EITHER WAY, I'M STILL GONNA REPORT THIS. BEFORE I DO, I WANNA INTERROGATE THE KID. HOPE YOU DON'T MIND IF I USE THE GREAT CELL. PLEASE. MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME. I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND HIM TO BE QUITE THE AMUSING SUBJECT. HUH. YOU'RE COOL AS A CUCUMBER. WE'LL SEE WHAT YOU'RE LIKE AFTER I'M DONE. WAIT, SHURA, JUST A MOMENT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO INTERROGATE MY BROTHER. I CAN TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW. YEAH, YOU'RE A LITTLE TALLER THAN THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU. BUT IN A LOT OF WAYS, YOU'RE STILL THE KID I USED TO KNOW. GO HOME AND GET SOME SLEEP. I'M OUT. SHURA-- [ DOORS OPENING ] [ RIN GRUNTING ] WANNA TELL ME WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? YOU'VE BEEN AWFULLY QUIET THIS WHOLE TIME. BACK THERE YOU SAID YOU KNEW MY OLD MAN AND YUKIO. UH-HUH. I WAS SORT OF A DISCIPLE OF SHIRO FUJIMOTO'S. REALLY? YOU MEAN YOU WERE LIKE A NUN OR SOMETHING? I NEVER PRAYED TO GOD EVEN ONCE IN MY LIFE. YEAH, RIGHT. GROWING UP, I LIVED IN SOME AWFUL PLACES. EVERY DAY WAS A STRUGGLE JUST TO STAY ALIVE. AND THEN OUT OF NOWHERE THIS MAN CAME AND SAVED ME, AND HE WAS SHIRO FUJIMOTO. [ SCREECHES ] [ COCKS ] BUT THAT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE YOU AND YOUR BROTHER WERE BORN. [ GASPING ] WHAT'S WRONG? DID YOU HURT YOURSELF AT THE AMUSEMENT PARK? - [ GASPS ] - DUMBASS. YOU JUST FELL FOR THE OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK. HOW MANY TIMES YOU GONNA GIVE THIS THING AWAY? YOU GOT A PROBLEM HANGING ONTO IT, KID? OF COURSE I DON'T. GIVE IT BACK! [ SHOUTING ] [ THINKING ] THE SWORD HASN'T BEEN DRAWN. BUT HIS POWER-- KURIKARA CAN'T CONTROL IT ANYMORE. WHAT? YOU WANT ME TO MENTOR THAT FOUR-EYED CHICKEN? [ SHURA ] [ FUJIMOTO ] NO. I'D LIKE YOU TO MENTOR THE OTHER ONE. YOU'LL LIKE HIM. HE'S AMUSING. WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME TO DO IT? BECAUSE YOU'RE AN EXPERT AT HANDLING DEMON SWORDS. ARE YOU GONNA GIVE HIM A DEMON SWORD? PUTTING SOMETHING THAT DANGEROUS IN THE HANDS OF A LITTLE KID'S INSANE. HELL, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT! YES, I DO, BUT I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. IF SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO ME, HE'S GOING TO NEED HELP. SO, PLEASE, TEACH HIM THE PROPER WAY TO USE THE SWORD. I'M BEGGING YOU. WHAT'S UP WITH YOU? YOU WERE ALWAYS COOL, CALM AND POWERFUL-- THE BEST EXORCIST IN THE ORDER. BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE OLD, YOU'RE GETTING SCARED TOO? YOU TOSS ME OUT LIKE I'M YESTERDAY'S GARBAGE, AND NOW YOU COME HERE TRYING TO DUMP THAT KID ONTO ME? JUST GET OUT OF HERE. DON'T COME BACK. SHIRO, YOU WERE THE GREATEST TEACHER. I REALLY WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT. DEVOUR THE EIGHT PRINCESSES. SLAY THE SERPENT. WHAT THE-- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU SAID YOU WERE THE OLD MAN'S DISCIPLE. BUT THIS COMES RIGHT FROM THE TOP. AND I'M A SENIOR INSPECTOR, SO ON THE DAY SHIRO DIED, THE VATICAN SENT ME ON A SECRET MISSION. THEY SUSPECTED SHIRO FUJIMOTO AND MEPHISTO PHELES HAD BEEN CONSPIRING... EVER SINCE THE BLUE NIGHT. THE VATICAN THOUGHT THE TWO OF THEM MIGHT BE HIDING SOMETHING CONNECTED TO SATAN, SO THEY SENT ME IN TO INVESTIGATE. BUT HERE'S THE FUN PART. IF I FOUND OUT THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY THAT WAS TIED INTO ANYTHING SATANIC, I WAS GIVEN PERMISSION TO EXTERMINATE IT ON THE SPOT. - EXTERMINATE? - THAT'S WHAT I SAID. YOU KNOW THOSE BLUE FLAMES SPROUTING OUT OF YOUR BODY? EVEN TO THE UNTRAINED EYE, THAT'S PROOF POSITIVE YOU'RE THE SON OF SATAN. SO AS ORDERED, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU. GUESS THE DISCIPLE'S GOTTA CLEAN UP HER MENTOR'S MESS AFTER ALL. YOU'RE GONNA-- HEY, WAIT. KIRIGAKURE SWORD TECHNIQUE, SNAKE FANG! - [ GASPS ] - [ CRASHING ] SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE HAVING FUN. NO USE TRYING TO INTERVENE THOUGH. THE GREAT CELL CAN ONLY BE UNLOCKED BY A SENIOR EXORCIST. THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO NOW BUT SIT BACK, RELAX AND WAIT FOR THE INTERROGATION TO END. [ RIN COUGHING ] WHAT THE HELL? WHAT JUST HAPPENED? [ SHOUTS ] THAT DEMON WAS STRONG, BUT SHE'S-- SHE'S WAY STRONG! [ SHURA ] SHIRO, WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? YOU IGNORED THE VATICAN AND RAISED THE SON OF SATAN. [ MEPHISTO ] WE TRAIN THE SON OF SATAN... AND USE HIM AS A WEAPON FOR THE ORDER. [ SHURA ] WAS THIS YOUR DYING WISH? IS THIS WHAT YOU RISKED YOUR LIFE FOR? WHAT YOU DIED FOR? DAMN IT, SHIRO! [ GRUNTING ] MAN, TALK ABOUT DELUDED. EVEN IF I DID TRAIN THIS GOOD-FOR-NOTHING PUNK, HE'D NEVER BE ABLE TO PUT A SCRATCH ON SATAN. SAY WHAT? YOU WERE A COWARD, SHIRO. INSTEAD OF FIGHTING LIKE A MAN, YOU DECIDED TO HANG ON TO YOUR IMPOSSIBLE HOPES. NO! YOU'RE WRONG. MY DAD WASN'T A COWARD. HE DIED PROTECTING ME. - I SAY HE WAS A COWARD. - YOU DON'T KNOW A DAMN THING. SO SHUT THE HELL UP! [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] I DON'T CARE IF YOU WERE HIS DISCIPLE. I'M NOT GONNA TAKE YOUR CRAP ANYMORE. AND DON'T DIS MY OLD MAN! [ GRUNTING, BLOWS LANDING ] [ SIGHS ] THIS KID'S OUTTA CONTROL. HIS ATTACKS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. HE'S GOT NO FIGHTING TECHNIQUE. IT'S PATHETIC. WHAT HAPPENED? YOU WEREN'T GONNA TAKE MY CRAP ANYMORE. IF YOU DON'T ATTACK, I WILL. KIRIGAKURE SWORD TECHNIQUE, RATTLE! [ HISSING ] [ SHOUTING ] - [ GASPS ] - [ SHOUTING ] [ SCREAMING ] [ GRUNTS, SCREAMS ] GEEZ, YOU'RE A MAN. DIE WITH SOME DIGNITY. THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA LET MYSELF GET KILLED IN A PLACE LIKE THIS. YOU HEAR? THAT SOMEDAY I WAS GONNA BE A GREAT EXORCIST LIKE HIM, I SWORE ON HIS GRAVE AND THAT I'D BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF SATAN! YOU'RE GONNA BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF SATAN? YEAH. I'M GONNA BE A PALADIN, THE MOST POWERFUL EXORCIST OF ALL. AND THEN ONCE I'M A PALADIN, EVERYONE'S GONNA KNOW THAT MY DAD WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG. DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH, YOU BRAT. OH, A PALADIN, HUH? [ FUJIMOTO ] YOU'LL LIKE HIM. HE'S AMUSING. [ CHUCKLING ] [ LAUGHS ] YOU WERE RIGHT. HE'S FUNNY. OH, MAN. OR MAYBE I'M THE RIDICULOUS ONE. I DON'T KNOW. [ DOORS OPENING ] YOU REALLY LOVED SHIRO, DIDN'T YOU? HUH? I-- I DIDN'T SAY THAT. [ SHURA ] YOU WEREN'T RAISING A WEAPON ALL THESE YEARS, SHIRO. NAH. YOU WERE RAISING... A SON. [ RIN ] OW! THAT STINGS! TAKE IT EASY. WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE? NOTHING. THE USUAL. I DON'T KNOW. [ DOOR OPENS ] [ SHURA ] HERE, CATCH. WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THIS THING? WHAT ARE YOU, BLIND? IT'S A WOODEN SWORD. - WHERE'S MY SWORD? - I'M HOLDING ONTO IT FOR NOW. TRUST ME, IT'S BETTER THIS WAY. WHO KNOWS WHEN AMAIMON'S GONNA COME AROUND AND SNATCH IT FROM YOU AGAIN? [ GASPS ] IF YOU WANT IT BACK, GET STRONGER. WHEN YOU CAN BEAT ME, THEN YOU CAN HAVE IT. HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO PROVE IT, KID-- THAT SHIRO WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU ALL ALONG. [ GASPS ] [ SHURA ] I WON'T SEND A REPORT TO THE VATICAN YET. I'M GONNA KEEP AN EYE ON RIN OKUMURA FOR A WHILE THOUGH. I'D LIKE YOU TO FIND A PLACE FOR ME HERE AT THE JAPAN BRANCH. AS YOU WISH. ACTUALLY, THAT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA. TO HAVE SUCH A CAPABLE EXORCIST IN OUR MIDST. IT WOULD BE REASSURING HUH. WE'RE DONE HERE. NO. YOU CAN'T LEAVE JUST YET. I HAVE THIS FABULOUS GREEN TEA ICE CREAM I ORDERED FROM KYOTO. HAVE SOME WITH ME. MEPHISTO, YOU WANNA CUT THE CRAP AND JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE UP TO? I ONLY DESIRE PEACE FOR HUMANITY AND ASSIAH. WHY, NOTHING. THIS IS MY HOME NOW. I ABANDONED GEHENNA TO LIVE HERE, REMEMBER? LOOK, DON'T FORGET YOU'RE STILL A DEMON. OUR SUPERIORS DON'T TRUST YOU AT ALL, AND I, FOR ONE, DON'T BLAME THEM. [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ] [ AMAIMON ] MY POOR BROTHER. NO ONE TRUSTS YOU AT ALL, DO THEY? AMAIMON, YOU AND I HAVE MUCH TO SPEAK ABOUT REGARDING YOUR RECENT ANTICS. HI, RIN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP SO EARLY? I JUST COULDN'T GET TO SLEEP, IS ALL. - ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING? - JUST REMEMBERING... STUFF ABOUT MY OLD MAN. OLD MAN? YOU MEAN SHIRO? YEAH.

YOU HIT YOUR FRIEND SO HARD HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL NOW, SUFFERING. THAT KID ISN'T MY FRIEND! WHAT? THIS IS ALL HIS FAULT. HE CALLED ME A DEMON, A MONSTER. HE DESERVED IT, AND I'D DO IT AGAIN! IT'S YOUR FAULT FOR RAISING A HAND TO HIM. [ SCREAMING ] [ WOMAN ] LOOK OUT! [ WOMAN #2 ] HOW DO YOU EVEN RAISE A CHILD LIKE THAT? LOOK AT HIM. HE REALLY LOOKS LIKE A DEVIL. IT'S DANGEROUS, LADIES. PLEASE STAY BACK. [ SCREAMING ] OW! [ GASPS ] [ GRUNTING ] - DAD? - PSYCH! I'M JUST KIDDING! I TRICKED YOU. [ LAUGHS ] - WERE YOU SCARED? - HUH? LISTEN, RIN, IF YOU DON'T CHANGE YOUR WAYS, YOU'RE GONNA FIND YOURSELF ALL ALONE SOMEDAY. INSTEAD OF USING YOUR POWER TO HURT OTHERS, YOU SHOULD BE USING IT TO HELP THEM. I WANT YOU TO HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF FRIENDS. THE GIRLS GO CRAZY FOR. I WANT YOU TO GROW UP TO BE A COOL GUY, THE ONE WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HOW AM I EVER GONNA BE SOMEONE LIKE THAT? YOU TRY.

[ SIREN WAILS ] I WANTED TO GROW UP TO BE COOL... JUST LIKE MY OLD MAN. [ AMAIMON ] I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. WHY WOULD FATHER AND MY BIG BROTHER BE SO OBSESSED WITH THIS ONE? AND WE'LL USE HIM AS A WEAPON FOR THE ORDER. [ SHURA ] HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO PROVE IT, KID-- THAT SHIRO WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU ALL ALONG. [ YAWNS ] [ CHUCKLES ] I CAN THINK ABOUT IT ALL NIGHT, BUT I WON'T HAVE AN ANSWER. MY BRAIN'S NOT BIG ENOUGH. COME ON. LET'S GO HAVE SOME FUN. OKAY! LET'S PLAY! LET'S PLAY! - I'M READY, RIN! - LET'S GO! ALL I CAN DO FOR NOW IS SHAKE IT OFF, KEEP A CLEAR HEAD... AND KEEP MOVING FORWARD. [ SHURA ] HOW'S EVERYONE DOING? I'VE BEEN TRANSFERRED...

ASK THE PRECEPT! RIN'S REALLY LATE. [ DOOR OPENS ] [ RIN ] SORRY I'M LATE, [ SHIEMI ] RIN!

[ GIGGLES ] AS LONG AS YOU'RE OKAY. IS IT ME, OR DOES HE SEEM A LITTLE DIFFERENT TODAY? MAYBE HE SUFFERED SOME KIND OF SHOCK OR SOMETHING. DO YOU THINK SO? NOW THAT WE'RE ALL HERE, HOW ABOUT WE GET THIS PARTY STARTED AND DO SOME LEARNING? LET'S HAVE MR. TARDY READ THE CHAPTER ON GEOMANCY FROM SEAL ARTS 101. HIT IT, OKUMURA. OKAY. IF IT'LL HELP ME BECOME A PALADIN, I'LL DO IT. HERE GOES! [ WOMAN ] ♪♪ [ CHORUS SINGING IN JAPANESE ] "ACCORDING TO ANCIENT LITERATURE ON GEE-O-MAN"-- OH, HOLD ON. "GEE-O-MAN"-- - GEOMANCY. - SEE THAT? HE'S THE SAME AS HE EVER WAS. YOU'RE RIGHT. I GUESS IT WAS ME AFTER ALL. [ BLUBBERING ] UH-UH. THAT WASN'T MY FAULT.
