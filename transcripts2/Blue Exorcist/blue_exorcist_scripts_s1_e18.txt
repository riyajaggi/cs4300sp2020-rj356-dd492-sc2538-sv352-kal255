 Blue Exorcist (2011–2012): Season 1, Episode 18 - Gufu - full transcript 
 Rin is undergoing training so that he can learn to master his demonic flames. Just then, a giant bird-like demon called Gufu swoops in on him! With Yukio's help, he drives it away, but all of the Cram School members are sent to investigate how the demon infiltrated the academy... Suguro and the others are still investigating when Konekomaru appears, begging for help, with Rin in pursuit. According to Rin, Konekomaru's been possessed by a demon, but no one else can see it. Suguro, mistakenly believing that Rin is attacking Konekomaru, turns on him with hostility!

 [ SHIMA ] OKAY, WHATCHA DOING? WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE? WE'RE CLEANING UP. SHOULDN'T YOU GUYS BE HEADING OVER TO CLASS NOW? WHAT, YOU DIDN'T GET THE E-MAIL? HUH? [ BEEPING ] I SENT THAT TO ALL THE EXORCISTS IN OUR REGION. I'M AFRAID IT'S AN EMERGENCY. WHY'D YOU SEND IT TO US? WE'RE JUST EXWIRES. THE SITUATION IS SO DIRE, MY BOY, THAT I FELT WE NEEDED YOUR ASSISTANCE AS WELL. HAS MANAGED TO INFILTRATE THE ACADEMY. A TYPE OF DEMON CALLED GUFU SIR PHELES'S PROTECTIVE BARRIER IS SUPPOSED TO REPEL ANY DEMON THAT'S MID-LEVEL OR HIGHER, SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT GOT IN HERE. A DEMON CAN ONLY CIRCUMVENT THE BARRIER ONE OF TWO WAYS. EITHER THE BARRIER HAS A TEAR IN IT SOMEWHERE... INSIDE THE ACADEMY WHO LET THE DEMON IN. OR THERE IS A PERSON SAY WHAT? WHO'D DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WHY? WHO KNOWS? I HAVE NO IDEA. NOW, THEN, I'VE ASKED THE INSTRUCTORS TO INVESTIGATE THE GUFU'S WHEREABOUTS. HOWEVER, I'D LIKE YOU EXWIRES TO PERSONALLY CONDUCT AN INSPECTION OF THE BARRIER. [ ALL ] YES, SIR. [ GRUNTS ] NOT YOU, RIN. YOU'RE STAYING HERE AND TRAINING SOME MORE. WHA-- THAT SEAL LOOKS GOOD. YEAH. THAT'S ANOTHER ONE. OF THESE BARRIERS ARE THERE TOTAL? HEY, HOW MANY [ GRUNTS ] 12,000. [ GROANS ] OH, MAN. THAT NUMBER MAKES MY HEAD SPIN. [ GROANS ] WE'RE GONNA NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN JUST TO GET THROUGH THIS THING. WHERE THE HECK'S KONEKO AT? HE SHOULD BE HELPING. I WOKE UP THIS MORNING, HE'D ALREADY LEFT THE DORM. ALL I KNOW IS THAT BY THE TIME I'VE BEEN CALLING HIS CELL, BUT HE'S NOT PICKING IT UP. HE DIDN'T WANNA COME WITH US WHEN WE WENT TO FIX KURKIKARA. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE HE'S THINKING ABOUT QUITTING THE CRAM SCHOOL. OH, YEAH? LIKE HELL HE IS! HE MADE A PROMISE, REMEMBER? SATAN KILLED HIS FAMILY, AND HE WAS GONNA GET REVENGE FOR 'EM. BON. HE'D NEVER GO BACK ON HIS WORD. NO WAY. [ WINGS FLAPPING ] [ GROANING ] [ GUFU ] DOES IT HURT? O-OF COURSE IT DOES. I GOT SHOT. [ GROANING ] ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ACCEPT ME AND BULLETS WILL NEVER HURT. WHY DO YOU REJECT ME? IF YOU HAD MY POWER, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO FEAR THE SON OF SATAN ANYMORE. COME. FIGHT WITH ME. WE SHALL KILL THE SON OF SATAN TOGETHER. NO WAY. THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT. I NEVER WANTED THAT. I COULD NEVER KILL OKUMURA. WHY DOES RIN OKUMURA HAVE TO BE IN THE SAME CLASS AS ME?

[ LAUGHING ] ACCEPT THE DARKNESS IN YOUR SOUL. I'LL LEND YOU MY POWER ANYTIME IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WISH. [ GUFU LAUGHING ] WHERE AM I? I'VE GOTTA GET BACK. EVERYONE MUST BE WORRIED ABOUT ME. NOTHING TASTES BETTER THAN REVENGE WHEN YOUR SOUL IS FILLED WITH HATE. THAT'S MY CHANCE TO HARVEST IT. [ RIN GRUNTING ] [ GROANS ] COME ON, HOW LONG AM I SUPPOSED TO KEEP DOING THIS? UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTROL YOUR FLAMES BETTER. YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP DOING IT [ GROANS, BLOWS ] ARE YOU COOL WITH THIS? SITTING AROUND WHEN THERE'S A DEMON TO HUNT? NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. I'D RATHER BE OUT THERE TRYING TO FIND THE GUFU. BUT I'VE BEEN ORDERED TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU, SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE. WELL, THEN, LET'S BAIL AND GO HUNTING. COME ON. WOULD YOU BE SERIOUS FOR ONCE? YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME HERE, RIN. IF YOU THINK EVERYTHING'S GONNA GO YOUR WAY LIKE IT ALWAYS HAS, THEN YOU NEED-- - [ GROANS ] - [ GASPS ] WHAT'S WRONG? IT'S NOTHING. JUST KEEP GOING WITH YOUR TRAINING. [ SIGHS ] YES, SIR. YEAH, RIGHT, SUCKA. THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE MY SKILLS IS BY GETTING OUT INTO THE FIELD. [ SHOUTING, GRUNTS ] [ GROANING ] IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, YUKIO. I SWEAR I WASN'T THINKING OF DITCHING. OH, MAN. YOU SCARED ME. [ GASPS ] [ JINGLING ] [ SHIMA ] MAN, MY FEET ARE ALL SWOLLEN. - OH, HEY, TEACH. - HOW'S IT GOING THERE? YOU SURVIVING THIS HEAT? I JUST WASHED MY FACE, AND IT HELPED A LITTLE. NEED COLD WATER.

YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S DANGEROUS AROUND HERE. [ GUFU LAUGHING ] DAMN IT, DON'T YOU LAUGH AT ME! [ MIWA WHIMPERING ] OKUMURA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE? I'M GONNA SLASH ITS ASS. RIN, STAND DOWN AND GET AWAY FROM HIM. WHY ARE YOU POINTING THAT GUN AT ME? THERE'S YOUR TARGET. WHAT THE-- WHOA, COULD YOU GUYS JUST CHILL? COME ON, PUT THOSE THINGS AWAY, HUH?

IF YOU GO ON ANOTHER RAMPAGE, THEY'RE GO-- [ GRUNTS ] I ALREADY TOLD YOU ONCE, OKUMURA. ANY OF MY FRIENDS, I SWORE I'D KILL YOU. IF YOU EVER HURT DAMN IT, ARE YOU BLIND OR SOMETHING? I WAS GOING AFTER THE DEMON. [ SHIMA ] KONEKO. COME ON, WAKE UP, KONEKO. WHAT DO WE DO? HE'S NOT WAKING UP? DON'T WORRY. HE'S FINE. HE'S UNCONSCIOUS, THAT'S ALL. OH. THOSE DAMN FLAMES OF YOURS COULD KILL PEOPLE, YOU JERK. [ GASPS ] WHY CAN'T YOU GET THAT THROUGH YOUR HEAD ALREADY? GET OUT OF HERE. [ METALLIC CLANGING ] [ SLITHERING ] [ HISSING ] [ RATTLING ] LOOKS LIKE HE FOUND SOMETHING. [ SHURA ] IS THAT IT? [ TSUBAKI ] PLEASE BE CAREFUL. YOU KNOW GUFUS ARE TROUBLESOME DEMONS. YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW. WHAT THE HELL? I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT LIKE THE LOOK OF THIS. AND I BET AN ACADEMY KEY WAS USED TO OPEN IT. IF THIS DOOR CLOSES, WE WON'T BE ABLE TO GET BACK, AND I'LL NEVER SEE MY KITTY CAT AGAIN. WELL, YOU GOT A POINT. WHY DON'T YOU HANG OUT HERE AND HOLD IT OPEN? WAIT! MISS KIRIGAKURE! COME BACK!

I MEAN, IF YOU WANT SOMEONE TO TRUST YOU, Y-Y-YOU KNOW, YOU-- YOU GOTTA HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT. HE'S GOT NOTHING ELSE TO OFFER. BUT THAT GUY, [ EXHALES ] I'M SCARED. JUST KNOWING THERE'S SOMEONE LIKE OKUMURA OUT THERE TERRIFIES ME. AH, HE'S NOTHING BUT A MORON. I MEAN, SURE, HIS POWER CAN BE PRETTY SCARY, BUT IN THE END, THAT GUY? NAH, HE'S ABOUT AS CLUELESS AS THEY COME. IT'S SILLY TO BE SCARED OF HIM. BUT IS THAT THE PROBLEM? - MAYBE YOU WANNA QUIT. - [ GASPS ] YOU WANT ME TO REMIND YOU ABOUT WHY YOU CAME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? ABOUT HOW YOUR MOM WAS BURNED ALIVE BY THE BLUE FLAMES. YOU HEARD THE STORY HOW SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH YOU AND PROTECTED YOU TO HER LAST BREATH. SHE DIED PROTECTING YOU. SHE LOVED YOU THAT MUCH. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? I KNOW. I JUST CAN'T-- [ SIGHS ] I'M HEADING OUT. STILL GOT ABOUT 6,000 BARRIERS TO CHECK. UH, BON. YOUR SHIRT-- WHAT HAPPENED TO IT? HUH? OH, THAT. WAS IT WHEN-- IT'S NO BIG DEAL. ALL I GOTTA DO IS BUY ANOTHER SHIRT. IT'S COOL. [ WHIMPERING ] [ GUFU ] YOU SEE? THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T DO AS I ASK. HE IS STILL DANGEROUS. THE TRAGEDY OF THE BLUE NIGHT WILL BE REPEATED. NO. YOUR FRIENDS ARE PRECIOUS. YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEM, DO YOU? ACCEPT ME. NOW. THEN YOU MUST KILL HIM. YOU MUST KILL THE SON OF SATAN. [ WHIMPERING ] - [ SCREAMING ] - [ GRUNTS ] WHAT THE-- [ GASPS ] KONEKOMARU! HEY, BON. I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE CONVENIENCE STORE DOWN THE HILL.

THING IS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING TRUSTING THIS DEMON? THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT YOUR FRIENDS FOR. SHIMA AND SUGURO. YOUR FRIENDS GOT YOUR BACK, NOT THAT THING! [ MIWA, THINKING ] WHAT AM I DOING? EVEN IF I KILL OKUMURA, IT'S NOT GOING TO BRING BACK MY MOM AND DAD. I'M-- I'M-- - [ GROANS ] - DAMN YOU! [ GASPS ] WHERE'S HE GOING? KONEKO! I WON'T LET YOU ESCAPE. YOU BELONG TO ME!

WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. ALTHOUGH I'M STILL CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE DEMON GOT THROUGH THE BARRIER. WELL, THE ONLY WAY IT COULD IS IF SOMEONE USED A KEY TO OPEN A DOORWAY. PRETTY OBVIOUS, REALLY. THEN THE SITUATION IS WORSE THAN I THOUGHT. ONLY A SELECT FEW ARE ALLOWED THE USE OF MY KEYS, SO NOW I'M REALLY CONCERNED. ME AND TSUBAKI FOUND THE DOORWAY IN A PARKING LOT IN TOWN. I WENT THROUGH IT AND FOUND A TORCHED RESEARCH LAB IN THIS BIG FOREST. - THAT'S SUSPICIOUS. - UH-HUH. AND IT WASN'T YOUR TYPICAL RESEARCH LAB EITHER. THEY WERE EXPERIMENTING WITH ARTIFICIAL LIFE OUT THERE, SOMETHING THE VATICAN OUTLAWED FOR THE LAST THREE CENTURIES. [ MEPHISTO ] REALLY? NOW THAT IS INTRIGUING. WE SHOULD OPEN AN INVESTIGATION INTO IT IMMEDIATELY. KONEKO, YOU'VE GOT SOME VISITORS. LOOK, I EVEN BROUGHT SOME FINE LADIES ALONG TO CHEER YOU-- HUH? [ KAMIKI ] AND HE'S NOT HERE. I WONDER WHERE HE'S GONE OFF TO. [ GASPS ] DON'T TELL ME HE'S THINKING ABOUT-- [ GRUNTS ] [ VEHICLE APPROACHING ] [ GRUNTS ] COME ON, STOP MESSING ARO-- WHAT UP? O-OKUMURA. WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THAT GINORMOUS BAG? YOU DOING LAUNDRY? UH, UH-- WHAT DO YOU CARE WHERE I'M GOING? IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS. HUH? AFTER MY PARENTS DIED, I WAS ALL ALONE IN THE WORLD. THE HEAD MONK AT THE TEMPLE TOOK ME IN AND RAISED ME LIKE HIS OWN. I ALWAYS APPRECIATED HIS KINDNESS, SO I MADE UP MY MIND I'D PAY HIM BACK. THAT'S WHY I CAME TO THE ACADEMY WITH BON. TRUTH IS, I'M JUST A SCAREDY CAT. I'M TOTALLY USELESS, SO I DECIDED TO QUIT. I'M ONLY GONNA GET IN EVERYONE'S WAY IF I STAY HERE ONE MINUTE LONGER. BACK UP. WHAT DID YOU SAY? THAT I'LL BE IN EVERYONE'S WAY. NO. BEFORE THAT. I'M USELESS? I DON'T KNOW. BEFORE THAT! HUH? YOU SAID IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, DIDN'T YOU? HUH? THAT-THAT FAR? DON'T SAY IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS. IT IS, 'CAUSE BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I THINK OF YOU AS MY FRIEND. AND I'D BE SAD IF MY FRIEND LEFT, YOU KNOW? OKUMURA. YOU'RE LYING. NO, I'M NOT. STOP TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER. SUGARCOATING IT IS NOT GONNA CHANGE THE FACT THAT I TRIED TO KILL YOU. AND IF I GET POSSESSED BY ANOTHER DEMON, WHO'S TO SAY I WON'T TRY AGAIN? THAT'S NOT WHAT FRIENDS DO, SO HOW CAN YOU THINK OF ME AS YOUR FRIEND? I KNOW, BUT YOU HAD FAITH IN ME BACK THERE, REMEMBER? YOU DID. AND I HAVE FAITH IN YOU TOO. THAT'S WHAT BEING FRIENDS IS ALL ABOUT, ISN'T IT? [ GASPS ] I MEAN, IF YOU WANT SOMEONE TO TRUST YOU, Y-Y-YOU KNOW, YOU-- YOU GOTTA HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT. BUT THAT GUY, HE'S GOT NOTHING ELSE TO OFFER. WOW, IT'S JUST LIKE BON SAID. YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO OFFER, DO YOU? HUH? HEY, MAN, THAT'S KINDA RUDE. I GOT LOTS TO OFFER. LIKE MONEY. NO. TALENT? YEAH, NO. [ SUGURO ] KONEKOMARU, WHERE IN THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? WE'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU. BON! HI, GUYS! SWOOPING IN LIKE THAT. WE'RE HAVING A MOMENT HERE. HEY! DON'T GO [ SHIEMI ] WHY IS HE SO ANGRY? [ SUGURO ] IGNORE HIM. STUPIDITY'S CONTAGIOUS. DON'T CALL ME STUPID. [ SHIMA ] YOU STILL GOT SOME HEALING TO DO, KONEKO. OKUMURA CAN TAKE YOUR BAGS UP FOR YOU. [ RIN ] WHY DO I HAVE TO? [ KAMIKI ] IT'S THE LEAST YOU CAN DO. YOU ARE HIS FRIEND, AREN'T YOU? GUESS I'M STUCK WITH 'EM THEN. ♪♪ [ WOMAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] [ RIN ] DO ME. TELL MY FORTUNE NEXT. [ SHIMA ] NOPE. DOESN'T WORK FOR GUYS. HOW COME? I'M A SPECIALIST. GIRL FORTUNES ONLY. [ KAMIKI GIGGLING ] THANK YOU, SHIMA. YOU'RE SWEET.
