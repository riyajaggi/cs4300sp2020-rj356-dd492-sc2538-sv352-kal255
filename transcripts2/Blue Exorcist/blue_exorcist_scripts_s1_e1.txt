LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. WHO ARE YOU CALLING A DEMON? YOU ASSHOLES ARE WAY MORE DEMONIC THAN ME. [ PIGEONS COOING ] OH, CRAP, I DID IT AGAIN. [ WINGS FLAPPING ] WHAT AM I DOING? DAMN IT. ♪♪ [ MAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] [ MAN ] OH, STRAYING LAMB, CONFESS THY SINS WITH TRUE SORROW AND PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS. YEAH? WHY SHOULD I? I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG. WHERE DID YOU GET THAT CUT ON YOUR FACE? I TRIPPED GOING DOWN STAIRS. - YOUR CLOTHES ARE A MESS. - IT WAS A MOTHER OF A FALL. AND THAT TRACE OF A NOSEBLEED?

WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS BRAWL? LET GO OF ME, YOU OLD FART! I JUST RECEIVED A DISTURBING PHONE CALL FROM YOUR EMPLOYERS. THEY TOLD ME THEY HAVE NO NEED FOR A DELIVERY BOY WHO DOESN'T BOTHER TO RETURN. SO WHAT? BIG DEAL. THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD CUT IT ANYWAY. AS IF A GUY LIKE ME COULD EVER HOLD DOWN A JOB. DON'T BE A BABY! A DAY WILL SOON COME... WHEN YOU MUST LEAVE THIS MONASTERY AND STRIKE OUT ON YOUR OWN. AND AS YOUR GUARDIAN, IT'S MY DUTY TO SEE THAT YOU DO SO. OR DO YOU JUST WANNA BECOME A PRIEST AND RUN THIS MONASTERY? TAKE OVER THIS CRAPPY CHURCH? DREAM ON. DAD. HMM? I'M ALL DONE GETTING MYSELF READY TO MOVE OUT. ALL THAT'S LEFT FOR ME TO DO IS CARRY OUT MY LUGGAGE. WELL DONE, SON. WELCOME HOME, RIN. GET INTO ANOTHER FIGHT? SHUT THE HELL UP. I SWEAR, FOR A COUPLE OF TWINS, THOSE GUYS COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT. - WHAT? - YUKIO MIGHT BE THE YOUNGER ONE, BUT HE DOESN'T ACT IT. HE'S GREAT AT SPORTS, ALWAYS GETS STRAIGHT A'S... AND HE'S ABOUT TO START HIS FRESHMAN YEAR AT TRUE CROSS ACADEMY. [ BOY ] MEANWHILE, HIS BIG BROTHER'S ONLY ACCOMPLISHMENT IS CAUSING TROUBLE. RIN, YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY BEING A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE YUKIO... AND START STRAIGHTENING OUT YOUR LIFE. I SAID JUST SHUT UP! WHOA! MY GOODNESS! WHAT IN GOD'S NAME WAS THAT? IT'S ABOUT TIME WE HAD THIS OLD PIECE OF JUNK REPLACED. FATHER FUJIMOTO, SOMEONE TO SEE YOU. FINE. CLEAN UP THIS MESS BEFORE THE SERVICE STARTS. RIGHT. YUKIO, I WANT YOU TO TEND TO RIN'S WOUNDS. SURE. COME ON, LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT. [ RIN GROANING ] THAT STINGS! I'M ALMOST FINISHED. JUST HANG IN THERE. SO YOU'RE MOVING INTO THE DORM, HUH? YEAH, WELL, SINCE SCHOOL STARTS NEXT WEEK AND ALL, I'LL BE SAYING GOOD-BYE TO 15 YEARS IN THIS PLACE. SO I GUESS THAT MAKES THIS THE LAST TIME YOU'LL BE TREATING MY INJURIES. WHEN I BECOME A DOCTOR, I'LL GIVE YOU ALL THE TREATMENT YOU WANT. FOR A FEE, OF COURSE. BEING A DOCTOR'S ALWAYS BEEN YOUR DREAM, HASN'T IT? THEN GO FOR IT. I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT BIG-TIME. DID YOU MISS THE PART WHERE I SAID I WAS GOING TO CHARGE YOU? LISTEN, YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT WITHOUT ME, AREN'T YOU? WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? ARE YOU GONNA LECTURE ME TOO? I'M JUST WORRIED, THAT'S ALL. AND NOT JUST ME. DAD'S WORRIED TOO, AND SO IS EVERYONE ELSE HERE. I MEAN, YOU'RE GETTING INTO FIGHTS EVERY DAY, AND YOU CAN'T SEEM TO HOLD DOWN A PART-TIME JOB FOR VERY LONG. LOOK, I'M REALLY STRESSED BY ALL THAT TOO. I KNOW I'VE GOTTA PULL IT TOGETHER, AND FAST, BUT I-- OH, YEAH! NICE SHOT! BULL'S-EYE! REALLY, CAN YOU BELIEVE HOW MANY MORE OF THEM THERE ARE? THEY'RE SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS. [ YUKIO ] HEY! HUH? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? [ ALL LAUGHING ] GET OUTTA MY FACE! I'M JUST GETTING RID OF THESE WORTHLESS PESTS... WHO JUST SWARM, EAT AND CRAP EVERYWHERE, SO SHUT THE HELL UP. [ COOING ] [ GROWLS ] I'M SURE YOU'RE JUST BEING TESTED IN A WAY, RIN. - BY WHO? - GOD, OF COURSE. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE STARTING TO SOUND JUST LIKE THE OLD MAN. [ DOOR OPENS ] AH, THERE YOU ARE. WE HEARD THAT THE SOUTHERN CROSS SHOPPING MALL IS HIRING PART-TIMERS. YEAH? WE CALLED, AND THEY WANT YOU THERE RIGHT NOW FOR AN INTERVIEW. WHAT? HOW DARE YOU CALL THEM WITHOUT TELLING ME? YOU'D BETTER HURRY. YOU CAN BORROW MY OLD SUIT FOR THE INTERVIEW. I NEED A SUIT TO INTERVIEW FOR A PART-TIME JOB? [ MAN ] HERE, TAKE THESE SHOES. DON'T MESS 'EM UP, ALL RIGHT? AND HERE'S A MAP AND YOUR NEW RESUME. PREPARE THE PHOTO YOURSELF. - WHAT DO YOU SAY? - [ GROWLS ] LOOKS LIKE THERE'S NO WAY OUT. [ GRUNTING ] WHAT THE HELL? HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET THIS THING TIED RIGHT? [ SIGHS ] NEVER MIND. FORGET IT. [ GIRL ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH, FATHER. DON'T MENTION IT. YOU REALLY NEEDN'T TAKE IT TO HEART. YOU'RE VERY FORTUNATE, YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE PARENTS YOU CAN DEPEND ON BY YOUR SIDE. IF YOU'RE EVER FRIGHTENED, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS CALL FOR YOUR MOTHER OR FATHER. AND IF EVEN THAT PROVES INSUFFICIENT, THEN EXORCISTS LIKE US WILL STEP IN. [ CHUCKLES ] [ RIN ] PRETTY TOUGH GIG, BEING AN EXORCIST AND ALL. I MEAN, YOUR JOB IS TO VANQUISH THINGS THAT DON'T EVEN EXIST. BUT THOSE DEMONS DO EXIST... IN THE DARKEST CORNERS OF OUR SOULS. THAT'S BULL. YOU'RE JUST A GLORIFIED GUIDANCE COUNSELOR. NEVER MIND THAT. WHY ARE YOU WEARING A SUIT? OH. WELL, THEY HOUNDED ME TO GO TO THIS INTERVIEW, SO I BORROWED THIS. NO NECKTIE? GOING TIE-LESS IS IN, FOR YOUR INFORMATION. [ CHUCKLES ] YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO KNOT ONE, DO YOU? GIVE IT TO ME. I'LL SHOW YOU HOW. UH-- LIFT UP YOUR COLLAR. BUTTON THAT SHIRT. REALLY, I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT A HULKING LOUT YOU'VE BECOME. AND TO THINK YOU WERE SO CUTE AS A SMALL CHILD, SHOUTING, "DADDY, PLAY WITH ME." THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. AND IT WOULD BE DAMN CREEPY... IF YOU THOUGHT A GROWN-UP WAS STILL CUTE. GROWN-UP, HUH? I DON'T SEE ANY GROWN-UPS HERE. [ LAUGHS ] OH, KNOCK IT OFF! THERE. IF IT STINGS YOU SO MUCH, THEN GIVE ME A GLIMPSE OF HOW MUCH YOU'VE MATURED. [ GRUNTS ] DON'T DIS ME. FINE.

SHE'S BEING PICKED ON. AND SNATCHING THINGS AWAY FROM HER, YOU KNOW? HE'S, LIKE, PULLING HER HAIR - YOU SAW THIS? - CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM? I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS SOMEONE LIKE I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
