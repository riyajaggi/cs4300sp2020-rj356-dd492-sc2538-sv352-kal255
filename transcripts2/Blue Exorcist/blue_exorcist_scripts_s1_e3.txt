NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME? YOUR TIE-KNOTTING SKILLS ARE QUITE EXTRAORDINARY. MAN, I GOT MR. SUSPICIOUS OVER THERE... AND YUKIO OVER HERE, WHO STILL WON'T ASK ME ANYTHING. IT'S KIND OF MIND BLOWING, HUH, YUKIO? I MEAN, YOU KNOW, A DOOFUS LIKE ME GETTING INTO TRUE CROSS JUST LIKE YOU. OH, UH, SORRY. I'M SO NERVOUS I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.

[ CHATTERING ] [ MAN ] MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE. I'LL BE TAKING YOU ON A TOUR OF THE CAMPUS AS PART OF YOUR ORIENTATION. [ GIRL ] YUKIO, WHICH CLASS ARE YOU IN? THE ADVANCED CLASS. OH, I SHOULD'VE KNOWN! WOW! YOU'RE SO TALL! HEY, YOU WANNA BE A DOCTOR WHEN YOU GROW UP? I, UH, I GUESS. THAT'S GREAT! THAT'S AWESOME! IF ANYONE CAN BE A DOCTOR, I KNOW YOU CAN. HMM? DO YOU REALLY THINK SO? HECK, YEAH, I THINK SO. THANKS. THAT'S RIGHT. HE'S GONNA BE A DOCTOR SOMEDAY. YOU'RE WELCOME. HE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE ABOUT ANYTHING. AND I'M NOT GONNA DRAG HIM INTO IT. NO. IT'S MY PROBLEM. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING. THIS IS A SCHOOL? WHOA-HO-HO. WOULD YOU GET A LOAD OF THOSE CHANDELIERS? IT'S LIKE A FANCY SCHMANCY RESTAURANT. DAMN! YOU THINK THEY COULD HAVE MADE THIS ROOM ANY BIGGER? HELL, EVEN THE DESKS HERE ARE WAY BIGGER THAN THE ONES AT THE MONASTERY. WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THAT GUY? HE'S FREAKING OUT. I KNOW. WHAT'S A WEIRDO LIKE THAT DOING HERE? UH-- MM. [ MAN ] THAT'S ALL FOR TODAY. CLASSES START NEXT WEEK, SO YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO YOUR DORMS AND GET SETTLED IN. AFTER JUNIOR HIGH, I WAS JUST GONNA GET A JOB OR SOMETHING. I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THIS HIGH SCHOOL B.S. ALL THAT MATTERS NOW IS BECOMING AN EXORCIST. WAIT. WHERE THE HELL'S THE DORM ANYWAY? NO ONE TELLS ME JACK AROUND HERE. [ WHINING ] HMM? [ PANTING ] WHO LET YOU IN? [ GROANING ] WHAT THE-- [ PANTING ] [ SHOUTS ] PARDON ME, BUT IT WOULD BE UNSEEMLY... FOR THE DIRECTOR OF THE ACADEMY TO BE CAUGHT PROWLING AROUND THE HALLS DURING THE DAY. YOU SHAPE-SHIFTED. DOES THAT MEAN EXORCISTS CAN SHAPE-SHIFT? GOD, NO. ALTHOUGH I AM AN EXCEPTION. HA. THAT KEY GRANTS ACCESS TO THE CRAM SCHOOL THROUGH ANY DOOR AT ANY TIME. CRAM SCHOOL? IT'S WHERE YOU'LL TRAIN TO BECOME AN EXORCIST. OH. EACH DAY YOU'LL ATTEND NORMAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSES. BUT AFTERWARDS YOU'LL TRAIN AT THE CRAM SCHOOL TO BECOME A PAGE. WHILE YOU STUDY EXORCISM, YOU'LL BE CONSIDERED AND EXORCIST IN TRAINING. YOUR HIGH SCHOOL CLASSES DON'T BEGIN TILL NEXT WEEK. BUT CRAM SCHOOL? WELL, THAT STARTS TODAY. I TRUST YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN? NEVER BEEN READIER. INDEED? I MUST WARN YOU THOUGH. IT WOULD BE BEST IF YOU KEPT THE WHOLE SON OF SATAN THING CONFIDENTIAL. SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT YOUR EARS, FANGS AND TAIL, BUT THE FLAMES ARE A NO-NO. CONTROL YOURSELF. OKAY. I'LL DO MY BEST. FABULOUS. VERY WELL, LET'S GET TO IT. HEY! NOW THEN, IF YOU'D BE SO KIND, TRY OPENING ONE OF THESE DOORS WITH THAT KEY I GAVE YOU. UH, YEAH, SURE. [ GRUNTS ] [ GASPS ] OH, WOW! THE FRESHMAN CLASS IS IN ROOM 1106. THIS WAY. OKAY. HERE WE ARE. OH, AND I'LL BE SITTING IN WITH YOU TODAY. OH, SHIT. NOW I'M GETTING NERVOUS. EIN, ZWEI, DREI. HUH? ALL RIGHTY, LET'S GO. WAIT! YOU CAN TALK? YOU'RE SURE YOU WANT TO BE AN EXORCIST? YOU BETTER MAKE UP YOUR MIND BEFORE YOU OPEN THAT DOOR. [ CREAKING ] [ THINKING ] WHAT A DUMP. [ CLOCK CHIMING ] I'M RIN OKUMURA. NICE TO MEET YOU. [ HUFFS ] WHAT'S UP WITH THESE GUYS? THEY'RE EXORCISTS IN TRAINING, HERE TO LEARN THE ROPES JUST LIKE YOU. SOME OF THEM HAVEN'T RECEIVED THEIR TEMPTAINTS YET, WHILE OTHERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN AFFLICTED. WHAT'S A TEMPTAINT? IT'S A WOUND OR A DISEASE INFLICTED BY DEMONS. SINCE BEING INFECTED WITH A TEMPTAINT ENABLES ONE TO SEE DEMONS, IT'S SORT OF LIKE A RITE OF PASSAGE THAT EVERY EXORCIST MUST UNDERGO. WELL, IN YOUR CASE, THERE'S NO NEED FOR IT, IS THERE? I MEAN, YOU ARE A DEMON AFTER ALL. [ DOOR OPENS ] AH, YOUR INSTRUCTOR HAS ARRIVED. [ FOOTSTEPS ] [ GASPS ] I'M YOUR INSTRUCTOR. MY NAME IS YUKIO OKUMURA. WHAT? YUKIO? HELLO THERE, EVERYONE. MY NAME IS YUKIO OKUMURA, AND I'M THE NEW TEACHER FOR THE ANTI-DEMON PHARMACEUTICS CLASS. NICE TO MEET YOU, MR. OKUMURA. PLEASED TO MEET YOU, SIR. WHAT'S UP, SIR? WHAT THE HELL, YUKIO? I'M SORRY. IS THERE A PROBLEM? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IS THERE A PROBLEM? YEAH, THERE'S A PROBLEM. - ALTHOUGH I'M THE SAME AGE AS MOST OF YOU, - WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU CALLED ME "TEACHER" WHEN CLASS IS IN SESSION. I'VE BEEN STUDYING EXORCISM SINCE I WAS SEVEN, AND I FINISHED THE LAST OF MY COURSES TWO YEARS AGO. SINCE YOU WERE SEVEN? YOU'RE KIDDING? HE HAPPENS TO BE THE YOUNGEST PERSON IN HISTORY TO EARN THE RANK OF EXORCIST. HE'S A GENIUS IN HIS FIELD. ALL RIGHT THEN. LET'S GET STARTED. IS THERE ANYONE IN CLASS WHO HAS NOT YET RECEIVED A TEMPTAINT? OKAY. THREE. WELL, IN THAT CASE, LET'S START WITH THE TEMPTAINT RITUAL. TEMPTAINT RITUAL? DEMONS WILL BE SUMMONED, AND YOUR CLASSMATES-- THE ONES WHO HAVEN'T BEEN AFFLICTED-- WILL RECEIVE THEIR TEMPTAINT. THE ROOM WE'RE IN ISN'T NORMALLY USED, SO GOBLINS MOVED IN. IF YOU DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW, ARE A TYPE OF DEMON. NOW GOBLINS, [ GIRL ] HUH? IS THIS PLACE SAFE? YES, IT'S SAFE. A GOBLIN IS A LOW-LEVEL DEMON, A MISCHIEF MAKER, SO THEY'RE PERFECT FOR RITUALS LIKE THIS. YUKIO, WHAT'S GOING ON? WAIT. HEY, YUKIO. CLASS IS IN SESSION. WOULD YOU PLEASE SIT DOWN? YOU KNEW ABOUT IT ALL ALONG. ABOUT DAD... AND ME. COME ON, YUKIO, TALK TO ME! IF THEY CATCH THE SCENT OF ROTTEN ANIMAL BLOOD, THAT BEING SAID, - THEY BECOME EXCITED AND TURN FEROCIOUS. - [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] HOLD UP A SEC. WE NEED TO TALK, MAN. RIGHT NOW. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT? - DON'T PLAY DUMB. - [ GASPS ] [ SIGHS ] FINE. IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT IT. SORRY, CLASS, WOULD EVERYONE PLEASE STEP OUT AND WAIT IN THE HALL? THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO DISCUSS WITH MR. OKUMURA IN PRIVATE. GEEZ, THAT KID'S A HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS. [ GRUMBLING ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] WELL, WE'RE ALONE. IF YOU WANNA ASK ME SOMETHING, NOW'S YOUR CHANCE. WOULD YOU KNOCK IT OFF? JUST DROP THE ACT. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. WELL, YOU HEARD THE MAN. EXPLAIN AWAY. SAID EARLIER. [ SIGHS ] IT'S LIKE I ALREADY I BECAME AN EXORCIST TWO YEARS AGO. AND WHEN I WAS SEVEN, THAT'S WHEN I STARTED TRAINING FOR IT... RIGHT AFTER DAD SUGGESTED IT. YOU MEAN, YOU'VE KNOWN ABOUT THE WORK HE WAS DOING? THE OLD MAN? YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE TIME? I DID. [ GASPS ] YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW, RIN. I GOT MY TEMPTAINT WHEN I WAS BORN. YOU WERE THE DEMON WHO GAVE IT TO ME. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE DEMONS FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER. NO WAY. WHAT THE HELL? WHY'D YOU KEEP IT A SECRET? WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING? - WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT BEFORE? - LET GO OF ME! ANSWER ME, YUKIO! OH, DAMN, THAT STINKS. - [ SCREECHING ] - [ GASPS ] YUKIO? THOSE ARE HOBGOBLINS, RIN. AND NOW THAT WE'VE RILED THEM UP, THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM. YOU'D BETTER WAIT OUTSIDE. - BUT I'M NOT DONE YET! - [ SCREECHING ] [ SHELLS CLINKING ] ALL THESE YEARS, ALL THAT TIME, WHAT'D YOU THINK OF ME? WHAT DID I THINK OF YOU? - [ SCREECHING ] - THAT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS. I MEAN, YOU ARE A DEMON, AREN'T YOU? - AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED, YOU WERE A THREAT. - [ GASPS ] YOU STILL ARE. MY GOD, YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT. AND IT'S A MYSTERY TO ME WHY YOU EVEN WANT TO BECOME AN EXORCIST. FOR REVENGE? OR MAYBE YOU'RE TRYING TO WIPE AWAY ALL THE GUILT YOU FEEL OVER OUR FATHER'S DEATH. IF THAT'S REALLY HOW YOU FEEL, THEN YOU SHOULD SURRENDER TO THE KNIGHTS OF THE TRUE CROSS. BETTER YET, YOU SHOULD JUST DIE. YOU THINK IT'S MY FAULT THE OLD MAN DIED? IS THAT IT? WOULD I BE WRONG IF I DID? DAD WAS PROTECTING YOU THE WHOLE TIME. EVEN I KNEW THAT. OUR FATHER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD... WHO HAD THE POWER TO RESIST BEING POSSESSED BY SATAN! BUT THAT ONLY MADE SATAN WANT TO POSSESS HIM EVEN MORE. HIS WILLPOWER WAS THE ONLY THING KEEPING HIM SAFE FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS. OUR FATHER WAS THE MOST POWERFUL EXORCIST OF ALL! THERE'S NO WAY HE'D LET SATAN IN LIKE THAT. [ SCREECHING ] SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO SHATTER HIS SOUL. TO BREAK HIS HEART. YOU SAID SOMETHING TO HIM, DIDN'T YOU? DON'T EVER LET ME SEE YOU ACTING LIKE MY FATHER AGAIN! IF DAD HAD A WEAKNESS, I'D SAY... IT WAS YOU. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO KILLED OUR FATHER. LISTEN. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT ME BEING AN IDIOT. SAY WHAT YOU WANT. I DON'T CARE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM STILL YOUR BROTHER, DAMN IT. DO NOT POINT YOUR GUN AT ME. WE'RE BROTHERS! - [ GASPS ] - [ EXPLOSIONS ] [ SCREECHING ] FOR THE LAST TIME, I DID NOT KILL THE OLD MAN. BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SHOOT ME, GO AHEAD, SHOOT! SHOOT! [ ROARING ] HUH. [ GROANING ] DON'T INSULT ME. I'M NOT GONNA FIGHT MY LITTLE BROTHER. WHAT WAS FATHER LIKE... BEFORE HE DIED? HE KICKED ASS. HE DIED TRYING TO PROTECT ME TILL THE END. YOU WANNA KNOW WHY I WANNA BE AN EXORCIST? IT'S NOT ABOUT REVENGE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I JUST WANNA BE STRONGER. I WANNA BE STRONG SO NO ONE ELSE DIES 'CAUSE OF ME! [ CRYING ] I'M SO SCARED. I DON'T WANNA SEE THESE SCARY THINGS ANYMORE. HEY. HUH? YUKIO, IF YOU WANT, YOU COULD JOIN ME AND WE COULD FIGHT TOGETHER. - OH? - DO YOU WANT TO BE AFRAID FOREVER? OR DO YOU WANT TO BE STRONG SO YOU CAN PROTECT RIN AND OTHERS? PROTECT RIN? I COULD DO THAT? YES. - LIKE ME. - HUH? I WANTED TO BE STRONGER TOO, AND IT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT DAD SAID TO ME THAT I'M AN EXORCIST. AND YOU SEE? WE BOTH WANT THE SAME THING, RIN. BUT KNOW THIS-- AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO BECOME AN EXORCIST, WHAT I SAID EARLIER WILL FOLLOW YOU THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE. BETTER YET, YOU SHOULD JUST DIE. EXORCISTS HUNT DEMONS, SO SOMEONE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE GUNNING FOR YOU. DON'T YOU EVER FORGET THAT, BIG BROTHER. GOT IT, TEACHER, SIR. [ DOOR OPENS ] [ YUKIO ] SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING, CLASS. SHALL WE CONTINUE OUR LESSON FOR TODAY? WELL, WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE? WHAT'S UP WITH THE ROOM? FORGET THE ROOM. WHAT'S UP WITH THEM? [ RIN ] 602, 602. OH, HERE IT IS. OH. HUH? HUH? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? SURPRISE. I GOT THE SCHOOL TO BEND SOME RULES TO LET ME ROOM WITH YOU. AND IT GETS BETTER-- YOU AND I HAVE THE WHOLE BUILDING ALL TO OURSELVES. HEY, YOU'RE DANGEROUS. SOMEONE'S GOTTA KEEP YOU UNDER SURVEILLANCE. HUH? SURVEILLANCE? AM I IN PRISON OR SOMETHING? YEP. AND THAT MEANS I'M THE WARDEN. YOU WANT TO BECOME AN EXORCIST, DON'T YOU? IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. [ GRUMBLING ] IF THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA BE, OKAY, BRING IT ON. [ YUKIO ] THAT'S THE SPIRIT. ALL RIGHT. NOW, LET'S GET THAT HOMEWORK I ASSIGNED OUT OF THE WAY. [ RIN GROWLING ] H-H-HOMEWORK? THAT IS WHAT I SAID. OKAY, OKAY. STOP HASSLING ME! ♪♪ [ MAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] [ GROANS ] NOW I'VE GOTTA COME UP WITH A LESSON PLAN THAT EVEN HE CAN FOLLOW. [ GIRL ] GRANDMA SAID IT'S A PLACE GOD CREATED... WHERE HE GATHERED ALL THE PLANTS IN THE WHOLE WORLD. [ YUKIO ] THEY EXPLOIT THE WEAKNESSES OF A PERSON'S SOUL. [ GIRL ] I WON'T LEAVE IT, MOM! I HATE YOU! [ RIN ] WOULD YOU SNAP OUT OF IT ALREADY?
