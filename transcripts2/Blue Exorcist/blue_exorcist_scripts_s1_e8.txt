 [ WATER SPLASHING ] LISTEN. HMM? DON'T YOU DARE TELL ANYONE I WAS CRYING. NOT A SOUL. UNDERSTAND? WHO, ME? WHY WOULD I DO THAT? JUST PROMISE YOU'LL KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT, OKAY? I'M NOT GONNA TELL ANYONE, SO CHILL OUT. [ GARGLING ] HERE. THANKS A LOT. IF YOU HADN'T SHOWN UP, WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED TO PAKU AND ME. SO, ANYWAY, THANKS A LOT FOR DOING THAT. OH, SWEET! YOU WASHED IT FOR ME. - HUH? - OH, MAN, I WAS SO WRONG ABOUT YOU. YOU ROCK, YOU KNOW THAT? WRONG! I ONLY WASHED IT 'CAUSE IT WAS STINKY. SERIOUSLY? WAS IT REALLY STINKY? [ YUKIO ] GOOD MORNING. MR. OKUMURA. THAT FEVER YOU'VE GOT WILL BE GONE IN ABOUT TWO OR THREE DAYS. YOU'LL BE UP AND ABOUT SOON. REST UP, OKAY? THANKS A LOT FOR EVERYTHING, MR. OKUMURA. - TAKE IT EASY NOW. - YEAH, I WILL. THANKS A LOT, RIN. YOU FIND ANYTHING OUT ABOUT THAT THING THAT ATTACKED US? I KNOW IT WAS A MID-LEVEL CLASS OF NABERIUS DEMON. I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT GOT IN THOUGH. WAIT, YOU SAID THE ACADEMY HAD ALL THESE SPELLS AND CHARMS THAT KEPT DEMONS OUT. WOW, YOU REMEMBERED. THAT'S IMPRESSIVE. COME ON, STOP MESSING AROUND. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE SPELLS. BUT SOMETIMES THAT KIND OF DEMON SLIPS THROUGH. IT'S IMPORTANT WE KEEP OUR GUARD UP FROM NOW ON. [ GIGGLES ] ISN'T RIN THE BEST? HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S PRETTY COOL. AND DON'T YOU THINK HE'S CUTE? HUH? HE-HE'S WHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY? I THINK MR. OKUMURA'S PRETTY COOL TOO. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TWINS, BUT THEY COULDN'T BE ANY MORE DIFFERENT. [ GIGGLES ] PAKU-- IZUMO, I-- I DECIDED I'M GOING TO QUIT THE CRAM SCHOOL. [ GASPS ] [ SIGHS ] I-I'M SORRY. WHY? WHAT FOR? I'M SORRY FOR NOT BEING A NICER PERSON. HMM. OH, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I FIGURED OUT THAT GOING TO THIS CRAM SCHOOL ISN'T RIGHT FOR ME, THAT'S ALL. TO CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU AND I ARE FRIENDS. IT'S NOT GOING COME ON NOW. DON'T GIVE ME THAT MOPEY LOOK. THE TRUTH IS, I LIKE YOU JUST THE WAY YOU ARE. I MEAN IT. I ONLY DO... AS MY MASTER COMMANDS ME TO. HIS MASTER. WHO IS HE TALKING ABOUT? I THOUGHT HE MEANT SATAN, BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHY SATAN WOULD WANNA KILL ME NOW. DEMONS OF ALL SPECIES WILL COME AFTER YOU FOR EVERY KIND OF REASON. DAMN IT. IF THEY'RE AFTER ME, WHY'D THEY ATTACK MY CLASSMATES? - RIN? - [ GROANS ] [ BOTH SHOUTING ] HEY, DON'T GET UP IN MY FACE LIKE THAT. IF I DID, WHY'D YOU SIT UP SO FAST? DUMMY. OOH! STOP MOVING ALREADY. IT'S OKAY. I CAN HANDLE IT MYSELF FROM HERE. [ GROANING ] [ SIGHS ] EVERYONE'S SHEETS? LEVEL WITH ME. WHAT'S UP WITH YOU WASHING WELL, I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING, AND SINCE I'M GOOD AT DOING LAUNDRY, I SORT OF THOUGHT THIS IS ONE WAY I CAN HELP OUT TOO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, TOO? ALL WORKING HARD TO BECOME EXORCISTS? YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE THAT'S DOING SOMETHING TO HELP OTHERS, ISN'T IT? I GUESS. DOES THAT MEAN YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND AND STUFF? I MEAN, DO YOU WANNA BE AN EXORCIST NOW? OH, I DON'T KNOW. ALTHOUGH-- RIGHT NOW I'M GOOD AT LAUNDRY, SO I'LL START THERE. [ WOMAN ] MOST DEMONS CAN BE DESTROYED... BY RECITING WHAT ARE KNOWN AS FATAL VERSES. THESE PASSAGES CONTAIN CERTAIN WORDS OR PHRASES THAT WILL CAUSE THEIR DEATH. IN BATTLE, ARIAS CAN IDENTIFY AND RECITE THE CORRECT FATAL VERSES AGAINST DEMONS. AND NOW WHAT BRAVE SOUL MAY I CALL ON TO RECITE THE PASSAGE I ASSIGNED FOR HOMEWORK? MISS KAMIKI? [ SIGHS ] MISS KAMIKI, IS SOMETHING THE MATTER? I'M SORRY. U-UM-- THE TE DEUM, DEAR. FROM WHERE WE LEFT OFF, PLEASE. OH, RIGHT. "DAY BY DAY WE MAGNIFY THEE, AND WE WORSHIP THY NAME-- THY NAME AND EVER WORLD-- EVER WORLD"-- WHAT'S WRONG, DEAR? HUH? I DON'T REMEMBER. OH, MY! MISS KAMIKI, THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU AT ALL. LET'S SEE, HOW ABOUT YOU, MR. SUGURO? YES, MA'AM. DAY BY DAY, WE MAGNIFY THEE. AND WE WORSHIP THY NAME, EVER WORLD WITHOUT END. VOUCHSAFE, O LORD, TO KEEP US THIS DAY WITHOUT SIN. O LORD, HAVE MERCY UPON US, HAVE MERCY UPON US. O LORD, LET THY MERCY LIGHTEN UPON US AS OUR TRUST IS IN THEE. O LORD, IN THEE HAVE I TRUSTED. LET ME NEVER BE CONFOUNDED. THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! WHOA! [ BELLS CHIMING ] [ SHIEMI ] AMAZING. THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. EASY NOW. DON'T START FALLING FOR ME. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. YOU REALLY ARE SMART, MAN. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? WELL, THE TRUTH IS, IT'S NOT THAT BON'S REALLY SMART. HE'S JUST GOOD AT MEMORIZING. SO IN OTHER WORDS, I AM SMART. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, KONEKOMARU? UH, YES. WHATEVER. MEMORIZING IS SOMETHING ANYONE CAN DO. HUH? YOU WANT TO REPEAT WHAT YOU SAID? - BON! - HMM, BIG TALK COMING FROM SOMEONE... - WHO CAN'T MEMORIZE FOUR SENTENCES. - OH, YEAH? IT'S NOT THAT I COULDN'T MEMORIZE THEM. I CHOSE NOT TO. ARIAS ARE COMPLETELY DEFENSELESS WHEN THEY'RE RECITING. THEIR PARTY HAS TO PROTECT THEM. THEY'RE NOTHING BUT A BURDEN. WHAT THE HELL? YOU KNOW I WANNA BE ONE, AND YOU DIS ME LIKE THAT, HUH? BON! I'M SO SCARED. WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA BEAT ME UP NOW? YOU GOT NERVE MAKING FUN OF PEOPLE'S DREAMS. HELL, THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS, I KNEW YOU SUCKED. DREAMS? OH, YOU MEAN THAT THING ABOUT DEFEATING SATAN? HA! I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT WHEN I HEAR A JOKE LIKE THAT, I LAUGH. YEAH? THEN HOW ABOUT YOU? WHY DO YOU WANNA BE AN EXORCIST? WELL? LET'S HAVE IT. WHY DO I-- I DON'T GO AROUND TELLING EVERYONE WHY I DO WHAT I DO... BECAUSE I'M NOT OUT TO GET EVERYONE'S ATTENTION LIKE YOU. [ GROWLS ] WHY YOU-- OW. IF YOU'RE GONNA FIGHT, GO OUTSIDE. [ YUKIO ] SETTLE DOWN. ENOUGH WITH THE FIGHTING ALREADY. [ DOG BARKING ] [ RIN ] WHAT THE HELL'S UP WITH THIS DAMN PICKLING ROCK? IT'S GETTING HEAVIER BY THE SECOND. IT'S A DEMON, ONE OF THE LOWER-LEVEL ONES. THE LONGER IT SITS ON YOU-- [ GRUNTS ] THE HEAVIER IT GETS. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A BARIYON IS? YOU REALLY ARE PATHETIC. OH, YEAH? WELL, IT'S YOUR FAULT WE'RE HERE, SO WHY DON'T YOU-- IT'S EVERYONE'S FAULT. ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS BOOT CAMP... IS TO STRENGTHEN YOUR ACADEMIC SKILLS. THE OTHER IS TO GET YOU TO START BECOMING CLOSER AS A TEAM. I'D RATHER DIE THAN BE FRIENDS WITH THESE LOSERS. YOU NEED TO LEARN TO GET ALONG. EXORCISTS DO NOT GO INTO BATTLE ALONE. WE FIGHT IN GROUPS OF TWO OR MORE. THAT'S BASIC PROCEDURE. IT COVERS YOUR WEAK SPOTS AND ENHANCES YOUR STRENGTHS. IN A REAL COMBAT SITUATION, THIS RIDICULOUS IN-FIGHTING... COULD GET YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE KILLED. YOU KEEP THAT IN MIND. OKAY. I HAVE TO LEAVE ON A MISSION, AND I WON'T BE BACK FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS. NOW THEN, BECAUSE OF THAT ATTACK YESTERDAY, I HAVE TO TAKE EXTRA MEASURES. I'LL BE LOCKING ALL THE ENTRANCES... AND PLACING A POWERFUL DEMON-WARDING CHARM ON THE BUILDING. THEN HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET OUT OF HERE IF WE NEED TO? LOCKING US IN? YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. I'LL ONLY BE GONE THREE HOURS. SO COOL OFF AND GET ALONG UNTIL I GET BACK. THREE HOURS? HE'S EVIL. SOMEONE KILL ME. YOU KNOW, I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE YOU AND THAT TEACHER ARE RELATED. BUT HE'S A GOOD GUY. I KNOW HE IS. [ STRAINING ] REALLY. ANYWAY, WE'RE STUCK HERE THANKS TO A CERTAIN SOMEONE. HUH? I DIDN'T GO UP AND GRAB YOU BY THE COLLAR, DID I? YOU'RE THE ONE WHO PICKED A FIGHT WITH ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. WOULD YOU GUYS QUIT FIGHTING WITH ME IN THE MIDDLE AGAIN? YOU'RE REALLY ONE TWISTED WITCH, YOU KNOW THAT? THANKS FOR STATING THE OBVIOUS. ANYTHING ELSE? WITH A PERSONALITY LIKE THAT, NO WONDER YOU'RE ALL ALONE. [ SHIMA ] WHAT THE-- [ SHIEMI SQUEALS ] OW! I DROPPED THE BARIYON ON MY FOOT. [ RIN ] YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING. DID HE TURN THE LIGHTS OFF ON THE WAY OUT? NO WAY! IS IT A BLACKOUT? [ SHIMA ] HUH-UH. I CAN SEE LIGHTS ON OUTSIDE. [ RIN ] YOU MEAN OUR BUILDING'S THE ONLY ONE WITHOUT POWER? I'M GOING OUTSIDE. SHIMA, BE CAREFUL. [ CHUCKLES ] I LOVE STUFF LIKE THIS. IT'S LIKE A REAL-LIFE TEST OF COURAGE. [ CHUCKLES ] THERE'S NOTHING HERE. SEE? MY EYES MUST BE PLAYING TRICKS ON ME. EITHER THAT OR WE GOT A DE-- [ SCREAMING ] [ GROWLING ] NOT AGAIN. [ GROWLING ] THE GHOUL CAME BACK. WHAT ABOUT THE DEMON-WARDING CHARM? [ SNARLS ] [ GASPS ] WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? EW, IT'S ITS FLUID. I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. I'VE GOT TO PROTECT EVERYONE. HEY, NEE? NEE. I NEED MR. UNA-UNA. [ SQUEAKS ] [ ROARS ] [ SHIMA ] OH, MY GOD. [ RIN ] HOLY COW. THANK YOU, NEE. YOU'RE THE BEST. NEE! YOU SAVED US, SHIEMI. THAT WAS QUICK THINKING. [ RUSTLING ] HUH? [ CREAKING ] [ GROWLING ] IT'S TRYING TO BREAK OUT OF THERE. DAMN IT. FOR A DEAD THING, IT'S PRETTY LIVELY, ISN'T IT? THAT'S BECAUSE GHOULS ARE MORE POWERFUL IN THE DARKNESS. [ COUGHING ] WHAT'S THE MATTER, SHIEMI? I'M FEELING DIZZY. [ COUGHING ] WHAT'S GOING ON? I FEEL LIKE I'M BURNING UP. - WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU GUYS? - THAT GHOUL SPRAYED ITS FLUID ALL OVER US. HOW COME YOU'RE NOT AFFECTED? I, UH-- COME ON, YUKIO. WE NEED YOU HERE, DAMN IT. ONCE MORIYAMA LOSES HER STRENGTH, THE BARRICADE SHE PUT UP IS GONNA DISAPPEAR. THEN IT'S OVER FOR US. [ BEEPING ] HELL OF A GOOD TIME TO NOT BE PICKING UP, YUKIO. IT'S UP TO ME NOW. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M GONNA GO OUTSIDE AND TRY TO DRAW IT AWAY. IF I CAN GET IT TO FOLLOW ME, IT'LL GIVE YOU GUYS A CHANCE TO GET OUT OF HERE. HUH? HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND? HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME. I'M PRETTY STRONG, YOU KNOW. IDIOT. HEY! OKUMURA! COME BACK! [ MIWA ] OKUMURA! [ SHIMA ] DON'T DO IT. [ GROWLING ] I'M THE ONE YOU BASTARDS ARE TRYING TO GET, RIGHT? COME ON. THAT'S IT. COME ON, BUDDY. MAN, THAT GUY'S CRAZY. WHA-- WE SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE WHILE WE CAN. MISS MORIYAMA, YOU CAN DROP THE BARRICADE NOW. HOLD ON. LISTEN. DO YOU GUYS HEAR ANYTHING? - HUH? - [ RUSTLING ] [ GROWLING ] [ GASPS ] NO WAY. HUH-UH. THE LIGHTS. IF I CAN TURN 'EM ON, THE GHOUL'S GONNA LOSE ITS POWER. CAN'T JUST STAND AROUND AND DO NOTHING. I'M GONNA RECITE A PASSAGE. BUT, BON, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT THING'S FATAL VERSE IS. YEAH, I KNOW THAT, BUT FOR GHOUL-TYPE DEMONS LIKE THIS ONE, ITS FATAL VERSE IS GONNA BE SOMEWHERE IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN. I'VE GOT THE WHOLE THING MEMORIZED. IF I START RECITING IT, I SHOULD COME ACROSS THE RIGHT ONE AT SOME POINT. SERIOUSLY? BUT THERE'S LIKE 20 CHAPTERS IN IT. ACTUALLY, THERE'S 21. IT'S NOT MUCH, BUT I'VE GOT CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH 10 MEMORIZED. SO IF YOU WANT, I CAN HELP. THANKS, KONEKOMARU. LET'S DO THIS. HOLD ON A SECOND. ONCE YOU START RECITING, THAT THING'S GOING TO FOCUS ITS ATTACK ON YOU. WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS. THAT GIRL'S BUSTING HER ASS ALL BY HERSELF. A GUY CAN'T STAND HERE AND DO NOTHING. THAT'S OUR BON. WHAT A MAN. I DIDN'T MEMORIZE ANYTHING, BUT I GOT THIS. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IF PUSH COMES TO SHOVE, I'LL BACK YOU UP. Y-YOU GUYS ARE CRAZY. OH, YEAH? HEY, WEREN'T YOU THE ONE ACTING ALL TOUGH A LITTLE WHILE AGO? WHAT, CHICKENING OUT NOW? [ GASPS ] IF YOU WON'T FIGHT, GET BACK. YOU START WITH CHAPTER ONE, AND I'LL DO CHAPTER 11. BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T GET THROWN OFF BY ME, OKAY? MM-HMM. HERE WE GO. RIGHT. NOW A CERTAIN MAN WAS SICK. LAZARUS-- OKAY. IS THE POWER GRID IN HERE? THERE IT IS. ALL THE SWITCHES ARE OFF, SO I'LL JUST FLIP 'EM BACK ON. [ RUSTLING ] - [ SHOUTS ] - [ ROARING ] [ GASPING ] [ ROARING ] DON'T MESS WITH ME! [ INSTRUCTOR ] EXCELLENT! THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WANTING TO SEE. THOSE BRILLIANT BLUE FLAMES YOU KEEP HIDDEN. ARE YOU THE ONE WHO-- SINCE YOU WON'T USE YOUR POWERS IN FRONT OF THE OTHERS, I DECIDED TO LURE YOU AWAY, RIN OKUMURA-- SON OF SATAN. [ SUGURO ] LET NOT YOUR HEARTS BE TROUBLED. BELIEVE IN GOD. BELIEVE ALSO IN ME. [ GROWLING, POUNDING ] WHEN THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH COMES, HE SHALL GUIDE YOU INTO ALL TRUTH. THIS BARRICADE WON'T HOLD THAT MUCH LONGER. BON'S RECITING THE LAST CHAPTER NOW. MORIYAMA! [ HISSING ] [ GROWLING ] DAMN YOU. AND WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS, HE SAID UNTO HIM, "JUST KEEP FOLLOWING ME." HOW'D YOU FIND OUT? WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT ME? [ CHUCKLES ] [ GASPS ] ARE YOU THE SCUMBAG RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ATTACKS ON US? ACTUALLY, I AM. BUT ENOUGH ABOUT ME. I WANT TO SEE MORE OF THAT POWER OF YOURS. - [ ROARS ] - [ GROWLS ] I'M GONNA MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS! [ GRUNTING ] JUST AS I THOUGHT. DAMN IT. WHERE THE HELL DID HE GO? HEY, COME ON. GET UP. MISS KAMIKI. STAY WITH ME, OKAY? WHAT'S WRONG? YOU'RE NOT LIKE YOUR USUAL SELF... TODAY. - [ GASPS ] - ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? AM I ALL RIGHT? SERIOUSLY? WHAT IS SHE SAYING? WHY WOULD A KLUTZ LIKE HER WORRY ABOUT ME? DAMN IT, BON. HAVEN'T YOU FOUND IT YET? SHE'S RIGHT. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME. THIS ISN'T LIKE ME. I HUMBLY APPEAL TO THEE, OH, GODDESS INARI. GRANT MY REQUEST. LEAVE NOT MY PRAYERS TO BE UNFULFILLED. HOW DARE YOU SUMMON US AGAIN! HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING? - YOU ARE NOT WORTHY-- - YOU WILL OBEY ME. [ GASPS ] CURSES, SHE SNAPPED OUT OF IT. [ GRUNTS ] SO THE SAYING SPREAD ABROAD AMONG THE BRETHREN. BON! ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE-- I'VE GOT A BAD ATTITUDE, AND I HATE LOSING. BUT THAT'S WHO I AM! ...QUIVER AND NEVER LIVE AGAIN! BEGONE, DEMON! - IT'S WORKING! - [ GROWLING ] NO WAY. THIS IS THE DISCIPLE WHO IS BEARING WITNESS ABOUT THESE THINGS... AND WHO HAS WRITTEN THESE THINGS. BON! AND WE KNOW THAT HIS TESTIMONY IS TRUE. - [ ROARS ] - [ MIWA ] THE LIGHTS. OF THE MANY THINGS JESUS DID, WERE EVERY ONE OF THEM TO BE WRITTEN, I SUPPOSE THAT THE WORLD ITSELF COULD NOT CONTAIN THE BOOKS THAT WOULD BE WRITTEN. [ ROARING ] BON! AM I DEAD? AM I? TELL ME. BON. THANK GOD IT'S OVER. [ GRUNTING ] HUH? HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER HALF OF THE GHOUL THAT-- BUT YOUR GHOUL-- WHAT HAPPENED? HUH? OH, I KILLED IT. I GUESS YOU KILLED YOURS TOO, HUH? AWESOME. HUH?
