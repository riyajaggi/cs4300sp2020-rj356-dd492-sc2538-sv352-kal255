 [ SHOUTING ] HIS POWER IS EVEN GREATER THAN I THOUGHT. NOT EVEN THE KOMA SWORD CAN CONTAIN IT NOW. [ SHOUTING, GRUNTING ] [ SHOUTING ] [ GRUNTS ] [ GROWLING ] NO, RIN. RIN! SHIEMI! - [ GROWLING ] - [ GASPS ] STAY BACK! WE GOT THIS. [ GROWLING ] [ SNARLING ] RIN! RIN! [ GASPS ] SHI... EMI. IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. RIN! [ SIGHS ] AH, SO BLUE. [ GASPING ] AS BLUE AS IT WAS THAT NIGHT, NO? HUH? WHO'S THAT? OH, GREAT. GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. ARTHUR AUGUSTE ANGEL, AT YOUR SERVICE. I'M A SENIOR EXORCIST FIRST CLASS FROM VATICAN HEADQUARTERS. ARTHUR AUGUSTE ANGEL? HE GOT PROMOTED A LITTLE WHILE AGO. HE'S THE NEW PALADIN. HUH? THE PALADIN? THAT IS CORRECT. I AM YOUR SUPERVISOR NOW, SHURA. HMPH! CARE TO EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON? NOW THEN. WEREN'T YOU ASSIGNED TO INVESTIGATE A POSSIBLE CONSPIRACY? ONE BETWEEN THE LATE SHIRO FUJIMOTO... AND THE JAPAN BRANCH PRECEPT, MEPHISTO PHELES? AM I CORRECT? YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT THE ONLY SPY YOU GOT STASHED HERE, AM I? TOO TRUE. AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE OTHER CRUCIAL TASK YOU WERE ASSIGNED. IF YOU DISCOVER THE PLOT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH SATAN, YOU WERE TO ELIMINATE IT AT ONCE. [ BOTH GRUNT ] SHURA, WOULDN'T YOU SAY... THIS BLUE-FLAMED SPEWING BEAST HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH SATAN? YOU'RE AS PERCEPTIVE AS ALWAYS, AREN'T YOU? - MEPHISTO. - LONG TIME NO SEE, ANGEL. I HEARD THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE YOU'VE BEEN APPOINTED TO THE RANK OF PALADIN. YOU HAVE MY CONGRATULATIONS, GOOD SIR. SO YOU'VE SHOWN YOUR TAIL. HAVE REACHED THE EARS OF THE THREE SAGES, REPORTS OF YOUR TREACHERY THE GRIGORI, AND THIS IS THE PROOF THEY NEED TO SEAL YOUR FATE. ACTUALLY, A GENTLEMAN NEVER SHOWS HIS TAIL. SUCH ACCUSATIONS ARE QUITE RUDE, YOU KNOW. [ CHUCKLES ] INDEED. CALIBAN, LEND ME YOUR POWER. OOH, GLADLY, ARTHUR. BY ORDER OF THE GRIGORI, ADVISERS OF THE TRUE CROSS, - [ GASPS ] - I SHALL EXECUTE THE SPAWN OF SATAN. [ SHOUTS ] RIN! KIRIGAKURE SWORD TECHNIQUE, SNAKE BELLY! SNAKE FANG! - [ GASPS ] - WHY DO YOU PROTECT HIM? ARE YOU IN LEAGUE WITH MEPHISTO? - YEAH, LIKE HELL I AM. - FUJIMOTO WANTED YOU TO TEACH THE BOY SWORDSMANSHIP. SURELY YOU DON'T INTEND TO FULFILL THE DYING WISH... OF THE MOST UNFIT PALADIN IN HISTORY. LIKE I SAID, YOU BALD-ASS BASTARD-- [ LAUGHS ] YOUR HUMOR DEFIES LOGIC. DO I LOOK BALD TO YOU? REGARDLESS, THE GRIGORI'S ORDERS ARE ABSOLUTE. EVEN FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU. [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] YES. UNDERSTOOD, SIR. THAT WAS THE GRIGORI JUST NOW. MEPHISTO PHELES, YOU ARE HEREBY ORDERED... TO REPORT TO THEM IMMEDIATELY FOR A DISCIPLINARY HEARING. REALLY? OH, GOODY. I CAN'T WAIT. SHURA, YOU'RE A WITNESS, SO IF YOU DON'T MIND, YOU'RE COMING ALONG WITH ME. THE SPAWN OF SATAN COMES TOO. I'LL NEED HIM AS EVIDENCE. EXCUSE ME. I'D LIKE TO COME TOO. [ MEPHISTO ] I'M SORRY, BUT YOU SHOULD STAY HERE AND LOOK AFTER YOUR STUDENTS. LIKE A GOOD TEACHER. HIS FLAMES CAN'T BE SUPPRESSED ANY LONGER... NOW THAT HIS SWORD IS DAMAGED. [ GASPS ] WELL, ANGEL, SHALL WE GO? [ FOOTSTEPS RECEDING ] [ MAN ] THE COURT WILL NOW HEAR THE CASE OF MEPHISTO PHELES, PRECEPT OF THE JAPAN BRANCH OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE TRUE CROSS. I, TIMOTHE TIMOWAN, CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE ORDER, AND ARTHUR AUGUSTE ANGEL, THE CURRENT PALADIN, WILL CARRY OUT THE INTERROGATION. PRESIDING ARE THE GRIGORI, ADVISERS TO THE KNIGHTS OF THE TRUE CROSS. SIR PHELES, LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO THE POINT. IS THIS CREATURE I SEE BEFORE ME THE SON OF SATAN? THAT HE IS, YOUR HONOR. I SIMPLY CAN'T HIDE THE TRUTH ANY LONGER. FIFTEEN YEARS AGO MY BROTHER RIN WAS BORN. HIS MOTHER WAS HUMAN. SATAN WAS HIS FATHER. AS A RESULT, HE'S INHERITED THE POWER OF SATAN'S BLUE FLAMES. [ ALL GASP ] UM, I DON'T MEAN TO PRY, BUT YOU AND HE ARE TWINS. SO DOES THAT MEAN YOU HAVE THAT POWER TOO? NO. I DIDN'T INHERIT THE BLUE FLAMES. I HAVE TO GET EXAMINED FOR IT EVERY DAY THOUGH. AS FAR AS I KNOW, I'M STILL HUMAN. [ WOMAN ] TO CLARIFY, YURI EGIN, JUNIOR EXORCIST SECOND CLASS, GAVE BIRTH TO SATAN'S SON. BUT THE REPORT STATES THAT FUJIMOTO KILLED HIM WITH THE KOMA SWORD. AND NOW YOU'RE SAYING THAT REPORT WAS FALSE? YES. THE FACT IS TWO CHILDREN WERE BORN, BUT ONLY ONE INHERITED THE POWER OF SATAN. AND THAT CHILD IS THE ONE BEFORE YOU NOW. HE WOULD'VE TURNED INTO A DEMON, OF HIS POWER, HIS DEMONIC HEART, SO I SEALED THE SOURCE WITHIN THE KOMA SWORD. EVENTUALLY, HIS POWER BECAME TOO GREAT FOR THE KOMA SWORD TO CONTAIN. IT AWOKE INSIDE HIM ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO. THREE MONTHS AGO? AND UNTIL THAT DAY, RIN GREW UP NOT KNOWING THE TRUTH ABOUT HIMSELF. [ THINKING ] BUT THAT'S WHEN-- DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. I'M NOT A DEMON. GOT IT? THAT'S WHY HE WAS ANGRY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO TO RIN? THEY COULD DECIDE TO EXECUTE HIM. DEPENDING ON THE VERDICT, REALLY? ONCE HE'S CONSUMED BY THE POWER OF THE FLAMES, HE'LL TRANSFORM INTO A DEMON. IF THAT HAPPENS, HE CAN'T BE ALLOWED TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD ANYMORE. BUT, YUKI, YOU SOUND LIKE YOU DON'T EVEN CARE IF RIN DIES. I NEVER SAID THAT! I DIDN'T. I JUST DON'T WANT HIM TO SUFFER ANYMORE. EVEN IF RIN WANTS TO, HE CAN'T GO BACK TO LIVING A NORMAL HUMAN LIFE. ESPECIALLY NOW... THAT HIS SWORD'S CRACKED. WHAT? KURIKARA'S BLADE IS CRACKED? WHAT DID YOU JUST CALL IT? HUH? I'VE ALWAYS CALLED THIS THE KOMA SWORD, BUT YOU CALLED IT KURIKARA. HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW THAT? KURIKARA. IT'S THE SWORD'S REAL NAME. CALLED IT BACK WHEN IT WAS ONE OF MY TEMPLE'S TREASURES. AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE [ GASPS ] BON, DO YOU THINK IF WE BROUGHT IT TO THE YOSHIKUNIS, THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING? YOSHIKUNIS? THE FAMILY OF SWORDSMITHS WHO FORGED KURIKARA. THERE'S ONLY ONE OF THEM LEFT NOW. DO YOU THINK THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIX IT? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. ARE YOU KIDDING? [ ALL ] HUH? THAT'S CRAZY. DO YOU GUYS EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? AREN'T YOU SCARED? FIX THE SWORD? ARE YOU SERIOUS? WHY ON EARTH WOULD ANYONE WANT TO DO THAT? [ SHIEMI ] BECAUSE RIN IS OUR-- [ MIWA ] HE'S THE SON OF SATAN! I KNOW HOW YOU ALL MUST FEEL. I UNDERSTAND WHY. BUT PLEASE, IF THERE'S A WAY TO SAVE MY BROTHER, I NEED YOUR HELP. PLEASE. - CUT IT OUT. - SUGURO. [ WOMAN ] SIR PHELES, YOU ADMIT TO HAVING SHIRO FUJIMOTO RAISE THE BOY IN SECRET. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, WHY? EXPLAIN YOURSELF. TO FIGHT SATAN. I WAS TURNING HIM INTO A WEAPON FOR THE ORDER. WHAT DID YOU SAY? [ PEOPLE GASPING ] YOU'D USE THAT BOY TO FIGHT SATAN? [ WOMAN ] THAT'S MONSTROUS! HE'S LYING! I ADVISE THE COURT TO THINK TWICE BEFORE BELIEVING THIS SWINDLER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SURELY YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN WHAT PHELES IS. LIES ARE THE STOCK AND TRADE OF HIS KIND. [ SIGHS ] OKAY, LET'S GET GOING. COME ON, TAKE US TO THIS YOSHIKUNI PERSON. HELLO? YOU GUYS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO KNOW HOW TO GET THERE. KAMIKI. WHATEVER. I'M TIRED OF LISTENING TO EVERYONE TALKING AND NOT DOING ANYTHING. [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ] WELL, BON? [ SIGHS ] ONE SECOND, WE'RE IN KYOTO. [ SHIMA ] THIS KEY CAN TRANSPORT US TO ANY CITY INSTANTLY... AS LONG AS IT HAS A RELIGIOUS SITE. LEAD THE WAY. MM. YEAH. [ HAMMERING ] [ SIGHS ] HMM? RYUGI! RYUGI! [ GRUNTS ] HEY! - OKAY. - [ GIGGLING ] [ GROANING ] [ CRICKETS CHIRPING ] [ CHATTERING ] [ GASPS ] HEY, GUYS? [ GRUNTS ] [ SHOUTING ] [ SCREAMING ] [ WOMAN ] NO ONE ARGUES THE FACT... THAT WE VIEW DEMONS AS OUR ENEMY. HOWEVER, WE'VE LEARNED MUCH FROM THEM OVER THE CENTURIES. THE BENEFITS OF THIS KNOWLEDGE CAN BE SEEN IN THE COUNTERMEASURES WE'VE DEVELOPED. EVEN SO, NONE OF THAT CAN EVEN BEGIN TO DISPEL THE SUSPICIONS OF TREACHERY BY SIR PHELES. AND YET HE HAS COOPERATED WITH THE ORDER FOR 200 YEARS. SURELY THAT IS REASON ENOUGH TO TRUST HIM. [ ANGEL ] THIS DEMON CONSPIRED WITH SHIRO FUJIMOTO... TO RAISE THE SON OF SATAN. THAT FACT IS INDISPUTABLE. [ SUGURO ] SHE'S 11TH GENERATION YOSHIKUNI. DESCENDED FROM THE SWORDSMITH WHO FORGED KURIKARA. A FEMALE SWORDSMITH? THAT SHOULDN'T BE SO SURPRISING. WHY, DURING THE MID-EDO PERIOD, THERE WAS A MASTER SWORDSMITH KNOWN AS LADY KUNISHIGE. THEIR NAMES MIGHT NOT BE IN THE HISTORY BOOKS, BUT I KNOW THERE WERE LOTS MORE LIKE HER. THE LADY REALLY KNOWS HER STUFF. HELL, THIS CHICK'S GONNA BE THE NEXT ONE TO LEAVE HER MARK ON THE WORLD. WHO ARE YOU CALLING "CHICK," YOU POSEUR? [ GROANS ] WATCH IT! [ CHUCKLES ] BON'S BEEN PUT IN HIS PLACE. MY FATHER AND I GO TO RYUGI'S TEMPLE TO CLEAN STUFF, SO WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE WE WERE LITTLE KIDS. YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HIM. HE WAS SO CUTE. HE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO CUDDLE WITH ME AND STUFF. [ GASPS ] COME ON, YOU DID. DON'T DENY IT. - WOULD YOU STOP IT? - HE WANTED TO MARRY ME. HE EVEN MADE AN ENGAGEMENT RING FOR ME OUT OF LOTUS FLOWERS. - GEEZ, CUT IT OUT! - [ LAUGHING ] HE WAS ALL, "PLEASE, MARRY ME. PLEASE. PLEASE." A LOT OF WORK, THAT'S FOR SURE. IT'S GOING TO TAKE BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE. YOU CAN REALLY FIX IT? MAYBE. IN ORDER TO FORGE A JAPANESE SWORD, YOU NEED IRON SAND SMELTED IN A FURNACE AT A SPECIFIC TEMPERATURE. THE PROCESS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR DEMON SWORDS THOUGH. YOU HAVE TO INFUSE THE IRON SAND WITH SPIRITUAL POWER THROUGH A RITUAL. BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM-- I DON'T KNOW ANYONE... WHO REMEMBERS HOW TO PERFORM THAT RITUAL ANYMORE. AND THERE ARE NO RECORDS OF IT LEFT ANYWHERE? HMM-MM. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A DEMON SWORD ANY OTHER WAY. [ SIGHS ] SO WE CAME HERE FOR NOTHING? I WISH I KNEW ANOTHER. OKAY, WE DON'T KNOW THE RITUAL, BUT WHAT IF YOU HAD IRON SAND THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN BLESSED? I GUESS IF I GOT MY HANDS ON SOME. BUT WHERE WOULD WE FIND SOMETHING LIKE THAT NOW? DO YOU THINK YOU COULD USE THOSE TEMPLE NAILS? [ YOSHIKUNI ] WHAT TEMPLE NAILS? [ SUGURO ] THERE USED TO BE A TOWER AS OLD AS OUR TEMPLE. WHEN THE BLUE NIGHT HAPPENED, IT BURNED DOWN. NOTHING WAS LEFT EXCEPT A BUNCH OF THICK TEMPLE NAILS. VALUABLE, SO WE DECIDED TO KEEP THEM AT OUR SISTER TEMPLE. THEY TURNED OUT TO BE PRETTY ANYWAY, LONG STORY SHORT, THOSE NAILS WERE MADE BY THE YOSHIKUNIS, RIGHT? SO THERE'S A CHANCE THEY WERE MADE WITH THE SAME IRON SAND USED FOR THE SWORD. [ YOSHIKUNI ] WELL, MAYBE KURIKARA AND THE NAILS WERE MADE FROM THE SAME STUFF. [ YUKIO ] THEN IF WE CAN GET OUR HANDS ON THOSE TEMPLE NAILS-- [ YOSHIKUNI ] I MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIX THE SWORD. [ SHIMA ] ANYBODY HOME? HELLO? THAT'S WEIRD. ARE THEY AT LUNCH? HMM. OH, WELL. LET'S HAVE A LOOK AROUND. I'M GONNA CHECK THE MAIN HALL. MIND IF I GO WITH YOU? LOOKS LIKE NOBODY'S HOME. I'M GONNA GO OUT BACK AND CHECK THE CHARNEL HOUSE. YOU WAIT HERE FOR ME, OKAY, TEACH? [ CICADAS BUZZING ] [ SHIMA ] HELLO? IS ANYONE AROUND? HEY, ANYONE? HELLO? [ GASPS ] [ SHIEMI ] OVER THERE! OH, PLEASE TELL ME THAT GUY ISN'T DEAD. HE'S OKAY. HE'S JUST UNCONSCIOUS, IS ALL. [ GASPS ] LOOK! SO ARE THEY. [ MALE VOICE ] WHAT'S WRONG? YOU WANT TO KILL SATAN, DON'T YOU? [ GASPS ] [ FEMALE VOICE ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHY ARE YOU TRYING SO HARD TO SAVE A DEMON? DON'T LIE. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FEELING. YOU KNOW NOTHING. BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF. HE IS THE SON OF SATAN AFTER ALL. THE WORLD WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM. ISN'T THAT HOW YOU FEEL? ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO SAVE THE SON OF SATAN? WHY? BECAUSE YOU HAPPEN TO BE RELATED BY BLOOD? ARE YOU A DEMON? YOU KNOW I AM NOT THE ONE YOU HAVE TO DEFEAT. DEEP IN YOUR HEART, YOU KNOW WHO YOU FEAR THE MOST-- YOUR BROTHER. AS LONG AS HE LIVES, YOU WILL ALWAYS LIVE IN FEAR OF HIS POWER. OF HIM. I ASK AGAIN-- WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SAVE HIM? WHAT REASON IS THERE FOR SAVING THE SON OF SATAN? REASON. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR TEMPLE BECAUSE OF SATAN? WHY THEN SHOULD YOU SAVE HIS SON? [ EXHALES ] [ GASPS ] WHY MAKE YOUR LIFE HARDER? ALL YOU NEED DO IS TURN YOUR BACK. LET THE ORDER GET RID OF YOUR BROTHER, AND THEN YOU CAN LIVE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WITHOUT FEAR. - HEY, TEACH! - SHIMA. [ GASPS ] [ GRUNTS ] - [ GUN COCKS ] - YOU'RE WRONG. MY BROTHER ISN'T THE ONE I'M AFRAID OF. I'M SCARED I WON'T BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PROTECT HIM WHEN HE NEEDS ME. I SWORE I'D BECOME A STRONGER PERSON JUST SO I COULD PROTECT MY BROTHER. I SWORE I'D PROTECT HIM. [ SIGHS, PANTS ] BEGONE, DEMON! SUGURO! [ GASPS ] [ GROWLS ] YOU WANT A REASON? I GOT ONE FOR YA. IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS, HE TELLS ME HE WANTS TO BE AN EXORCIST... SO HE CAN KICK SATAN'S ASS, AND HE'S THE FRIGGIN' SON OF SATAN. I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING SO TWISTED IN MY LIFE. SO IF HE DIES BEFORE I CAN ASK HIM WHAT HE MEANT, I'LL BE PISSED! [ CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] [ SIGHS, PANTS ] [ SUGURO ] THE HEAD PRIEST IS SAFE. GOOD. I'M GLAD. THE DEMON WE CONFRONTED, IT WAS MARA, WASN'T IT? YES. MARA TRIED TO DISTRACT SIDDHARTHA... WHILE HE WAS MEDITATING TO REACH ENLIGHTENMENT. PREYING ON A PERSON'S DOUBTS AND WEAKNESSES, HUH? TYPICAL. I REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT DEMONS LIKE MARA... AND HOW THEY POSSESS THE BUDDHIST STATUES IN OLD TEMPLES. I BROUGHT THE TEMPLE NAILS YOU ASKED FOR. GREAT. THANK YOU. HE PLANNED TO BETRAY THE ORDER AND DESTROY IT FROM WITHIN. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT MEPHISTO'S TREACHERY. BUT EVEN SO, THE ORDER HAS NEVER HAD A WEAPON POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DEFEAT SATAN AND HIS ARMIES. THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS ISSUE IS UNPRECEDENTED. AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT COULD SPELL THE END OF THE ORDER. [ THINKING ] DAMN, HOW LONG ARE THEY GONNA KEEP YAPPING? - [ RUMBLING ] - [ SHURA ] WHAT IS HAPPENING? [ CHUCKLES ] DAMN HIM. [ AMAIMON ] WHERE IS HE? TELL ME WHERE HE IS. I HAVEN'T LOST THE BATTLE YET. [ FEMALE GRIGORI ] AMAIMON? HOW DID HE GET IN HERE? - [ MAN ] ANGEL! - YES, SIR. SIR PHELES, ARE YOU BEHIND THIS? YOU JEST, MILORD. WHAT ON EARTH WOULD I HAVE TO GAIN BY CAUSING SUCH MISCHIEF AT MY OWN HEARING? THAT BEING SAID, MIGHT I SUGGEST WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY. INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT HIS POTENTIAL, SEE FOR YOURSELVES JUST HOW POWERFUL THE SPAWN OF SATAN IS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? [ MEPHISTO ] WE ARE UNDER SIEGE, MILADY. AND CURRENTLY THE BOY IS THE ONLY WEAPON POWERFUL ENOUGH TO PROTECT US. WHO WOULD LIKE TO BET ON WHETHER RIN OKUMURA BECOMES THE SAVIOR OF ASSIAH... OR HE BECOMES THE DEMON KING OF GEHENNA? WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO SEE THE OUTCOME WITH YOUR VERY OWN EYES? ♪♪ [ WOMAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] MM-HMM. RIGHT. THIS IS GOING TO WORK. - [ GASPING ] - YEAH! [ RUMBLING ] [ MEPHISTO ] NO PRESSURE, BUT THE POLLS WILL BE CLOSING SOON. TIME TO CAST YOUR VOTES-- YEA OR NAY. - [ YUKIO ] YOU FIEND! - [ AMAIMON ] I'VE COME TO SETTLE THINGS, RIN OKUMURA. [ YUKIO ] WAKE UP!
