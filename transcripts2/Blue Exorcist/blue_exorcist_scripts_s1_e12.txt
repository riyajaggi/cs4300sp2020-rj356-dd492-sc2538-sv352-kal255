 ITS SAMURAI SPIRIT. NOT TO MENTION THE HEART OF ITS CULTURE, THE FABULOUS WORLD OF MOE. TO HAVE A BROTHER AS AMAZING AS YOU ARE IS TRULY A BLESSING. THANK YOU FOR THE COMPLIMENT. BY THE WAY, DO YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND HIM? OH. HE'S OVER THERE. HMM. [ AMAIMON ] AN AMUSEMENT PARK? [ MEPHISTO ] THAT'S RIGHT. [ THINKING ] YOU'RE FINALLY IN THE MOOD TO PLAY WITH HIM. [ CHUCKLING ] ♪♪ [ MAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] [ SHIMA ] OH, MAN. A FIELD TRIP TO AN AMUSEMENT PARK? THIS IS WHERE YOU TAKE GIRLS ON DATES. THIS ISN'T ABOUT HAVING FUN. BY THE WAY, HOW DID YOUR TEAM DO ON YOUR MISSION? I WOULDN'T CALL IT A MISSION. WOULD YOU? A BIG-ASS SQUID'S WHAT I'D CALL IT. A SQUID? REALLY? REALLY. MAN, SITTING AROUND THESE LOSERS IS A DRAG. EXCUSE ME? HA! WE NEED PEOPLE IN CLASS WHO CAN PULL THEIR WEIGHT, NOT USELESS DUMBASSES LIKE THEM. OH. EASY DOES IT. [ HUFFS ] [ SHIEMI ] I'M SORRY I'M SO LATE. HMM? HUH? - HUH? - [ GASPS ] [ BOYS ] WHOA! WHERE'S YOUR KIMONO? SH-SHIEMI, WHAT'S GOING ON? I ASKED THE DIRECTOR TO ISSUE ME A UNIFORM... BECAUSE KIMONOS AREN'T THE BEST THING TO WEAR ON MISSIONS. MISS KAMIKI WAS TEACHING ME HOW TO WEAR IT RIGHT. OH, AND ALSO BECAUSE LIKE THAT'S MY JOB? UM, IT DOESN'T LOOK FUNNY ON ME, DOES IT? OOH, WOW, YOU SURE LOOK CUTE, MORIYAMA. MM-HMM. THANK YOU. AM I SEEING THINGS, OR IS HER SKIRT, LIKE, WAY, WAY TOO SHORT? I MEAN, DAMN! WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I TOTALLY SAW YOU STARING AT HER B-- THAT HURT, FOUR-EYES! THAT YOU'RE ALL HERE, LET'S GET STARTED. OKAY, AND NOW YOU'LL BE TEAMING UP IN GROUPS OF TWO FOR TODAY. UH, MIWA AND TAKARA. YAMADA AND SUGURO. CRAP! THAT FIGURES. KAMIKI AND SHIMA. OKUMURA AND MORIYAMA. WE'RE TOGETHER, RIN. HUH? OH, SWEET. AS YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW, THIS IS MEPPHYLAND. AND THE REASON WE'RE HERE IS IN RESPONSE TO REPORTS REGARDING A MISCHIEVOUS GHOST. TODAY, YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES TRACKING IT DOWN. WE'VE SEALED THE PARK OFF FROM THE PUBLIC, SO YOU HAVE THE WHOLE DAY TO FIND THE GHOST. ONCE YOU'VE FOUND IT, CALL EITHER MR. TSUBAKI OR MYSELF. [ CLEARS THROAT ] NOW WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF A GHOST? MISS KAMIKI? YES, SIR. A GHOST IS A DEMON THAT POSSESSES THE VOLATILE EMISSIONS... FROM THE CORPSE OF EITHER A HUMAN OR AN ANIMAL. IT ASSUMES AND EXPRESSES THE EMOTIONS ITS HOST HAD BEFORE DEATH. MM. VERY GOOD. UM, EXACTLY HOW MANY GHOSTS ARE WE LOOKING FOR? THERE HAVE BEEN SIGHTINGS ALL OVER THE PARK, BUT ACCORDING TO OUR INTEL, IT'S JUST THE ONE GHOST. IT ALWAYS APPEARS IN THE FORM OF A SMALL BOY, AND SO FAR, ITS MISCHIEF HAS BEEN LIMITED TO ARM-PULLING AND SKIRT-FLIPPING. HUH? SKIRT-FLIPPING? REALLY? THAT'S CHILDISH. OH, WAIT. IT IS A CHILD. THE PRANKS WILL ONLY GET MORE DANGEROUS, SO IT'S IMPERATIVE WE FIND THE GHOST QUICKLY. IF WE SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE PARK, WE'LL FIND IT IN NO TIME. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS? ALL RIGHT. GOOD LUCK! [ BUZZING ] YOU KEEP AN EYE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE STREET, AND I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON THE LEFT, OKAY? SURE. [ THINKING ] SHE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD IN THAT.

YOU'RE ALL PUFFED UP. ARE YOU MAD OR SOMETHING? I'M NOT MAD. [ QUAVERING ] REALLY, I'M NOT. I'M NOT LAUGHING EITHER. HUH? [ MECHANISMS GRINDING ] WELL, HEY, WAIT UP. YOU'RE ACTING REALLY WEIRD. [ GASPS ] [ SIGHS ] UH, SHIEMI? I-I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED THAT SOMEDAY I'D GET TO GO TO AN AMUSEMENT PARK. BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I COULDN'T STAND TO BE IN BIG CROWDS OF PEOPLE, SO AMUSEMENT PARKS WERE OUT OF THE QUESTION. I BET THIS PLACE CAN BE REALLY FUN ON THE DAYS WHEN IT'S OPEN. MAYBE-- MAYBE NOW I'D BE OKAY TO-- [ GROANS ] THEN HEY, WHY DON'T YOU AND ME COME AND HANG OUT HERE SOMETIME? SURE. YOU REALLY WANT TO? [ BLUBBERING ] YOU MEAN IT? YOU PROMISE? MM-HMM.

THE BLADE OF THE SWORD ACTS LIKE A SMALL ENTRANCE LEADING TO GEHENNA. AND THE SCABBARD HERE ACTS AS KIND OF A DOORWAY TO IT. IF I SHEATH THE BLADE, THE ENTRANCE IS CLOSED. WHEN I DRAW IT OUT, IT'S OPENED. DAMN IT, WOULD YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND? HMM, ALL RIGHT. I'LL KEEP IT OPEN. [ GRUNTS ] HUH. SO YOUR FLAMES AND YOUR POWER LIE IN GEHENNA...
