 IS ALL RIGHT. [ LOUD CLANG ] [ GASPS ] [ GASPS ] OH, NO! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? THAT LOOKS BAD. IT NEEDS TREATMENT RIGHT AWAY. [ GRUNTING ] [ GASPS ] I CAN'T MOVE HER. WHAT DO I DO? NEE! NEE? [ VOICES ] NEE. NEE. HUH? WHAT? YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME MOVE HER? [ DEEP VOICE ] NEE. HUH? WHAT? OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn ♪♪ [ MEN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] [ TRAIN HORN BLOWS ] [ EGIN ] DON'T JUST STAND THERE. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. THEY SAY BOYS SOMETIMES TAKE AFTER THEIR MOTHERS. LOOKING AT YOU, I SEE A RESEMBLANCE TO YURI. YURI? DIDN'T FUJIMOTO TELL YOU ABOUT HER? HE DIDN'T. NOT A THING. I SEE. THAT IS THE ONLY PHOTOGRAPH I HAVE OF YURI. I KNOW THAT BEFORE HE DIED, FUJIMOTO APPOINTED SIR PHELES AS YOUR GUARDIAN. WHEN I FOUND OUT HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY THE KNIGHTS OF THE TRUE CROSS, I DECIDED TO TAKE ACTION. I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU AND YOUR BROTHER IN. I AM YOUR GRANDFATHER AFTER ALL. WHEN I WAS LITTLE, IN KINDERGARTEN, TEACHER ONCE MADE US DRAW A PICTURE OF OUR MOTHER FOR MOTHER'S DAY. RIN DREW WHAT HE THOUGHT SHE LOOKED LIKE. BUT I COULDN'T NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED. I FEEL THE SAME NOW AS I DID THEN. FOR 15 YEARS, YOU LIVED A LIFE OF PAIN AND LONELINESS. I AM SO SORRY FOR HAVING PUT YOU THROUGH THAT. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE. YOU SEE, I WAS IMPRISONED THAT WHOLE TIME. - IMPRISONED? - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO, BUT IN THAT INSTANT I LOST EVERYTHING. I SURVIVED THE BLUE NIGHT, MY STANDING, MY HONOR, THIS FACE OF MINE, NOT TO MENTION MY BELOVED DAUGHTER YURI. SHE DIED? THEN SHE WAS KILLED BY SATAN LIKE ALL THE OTHERS. NO. SHE DIDN'T DIE BY SATAN'S HANDS. IT WAS MY JAILERS, THE VATICAN. [ GASPS ] ON THAT HORRIBLE DAY WHEN SATAN DESTROYED ALL THE EXORCISTS, THE VATICAN FOUND OUT YURI WAS PREGNANT WITH THE SPAWN OF SATAN. YOU MEAN MY BROTHER AND ME. [ EGIN ] THE GRIGORI EXECUTED YURI AS A WITCH. [ CLAMORING ] NO! THE WITCH HUNTS HAVE BEEN OVER FOR CENTURIES. WHY WOULD THEY CONDEMN MY MOTHER TO DEATH LIKE THAT? THE KNIGHTS OF THE TRUE CROSS WERE TRYING TO RESTORE THEIR AUTHORITY. THEY USED YURI AS THEIR SCAPEGOAT. - IMPOSSIBLE. - [ TRAIN HORN BLARES ] [ EGIN ] THE ORDER OPERATES THE SAME WAY THEY DID 600 YEARS AGO. FOR BEING THE FATHER OF A WITCH, I WAS THROWN INTO PRISON AND LEFT TO ROT. I ALMOST LOST THE WILL TO LIVE, BUT I HAD ONE LAST HOPE TO HANG ONTO. - THIS. - WHAT IS THAT? A PHOTOGRAPH GIVEN TO ME BY FUJIMOTO. ALL THOSE YEARS I KEPT THINKING ABOUT HOW I LONGED TO HOLD YOU BOTH IN MY ARMS-- THE CHILDREN YURI RISKED HER LIFE FOR. - [ GASPS ] - HOWEVER, HAD THE VATICAN... DISCOVERED THE TRUTH OF YOUR EXISTENCE, THEY WOULD SURELY HAVE HUNTED YOU DOWN. AND THAT'S THE REASON YOU COULD NEVER COME FORWARD. EXACTLY. BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM THE GRIGORI ANYMORE. YOU WILL BE WITH ME FROM NOW ON. WAIT. WHAT ABOUT MY BROTHER? EVERYTHING YOU SAID IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND HIM. HE SHOULD BE HERE TOO. UNFORTUNATELY, NOW THAT THE DEMON IN HIM HAS AWAKENED, I CAN'T TAKE HIM WITH US. WHERE EXACTLY ARE YOU TAKING ME? [ GASPS ] - WHAT'S THIS? - THE DRAGOON LABORATORY, OUR ANTIDEMON WEAPONS UNIT. NOW THAT THE KNIGHTS OF THE TRUE CROSS HAVE BECOME MEPHISTO'S PUPPETS, THEY CAN'T PROTECT ASSIAH ANY LONGER. I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME, YUKIO. TOGETHER, WE CAN CREATE A NEW ERA, ONE THAT WILL BRING PEACE AND FREEDOM TO ALL OF MANKIND. [ DOOR OPENS ] HOW DID IT GO AT THE MONASTERY? IT'S ALL GOOD. THANKS TO HIS FLAMES, ALL THE WEBS WERE NEUTRALIZED. THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES. WHERE'S YUKIO? HMM? OH, I DON'T KNOW. HE HASN'T COME BACK HERE YET. WHERE'D YOU TAKE MR. NOIHAUS? TO THE GREAT CELL. HE'S BEING INTERROGATED. COOL. THANKS. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? I GOT AS MUCH A RIGHT TO LISTEN IN AS ANYONE ELSE, DON'T I? HEY-- YOU HEAR ABOUT NOIHAUS? APPARENTLY, THE VATICAN WANTS TO GET ITS HANDS ON HIM. REALLY? THE VATICAN? YES. AND THE DIRECTOR'S ALSO BEEN ARRESTED. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR SCHOOL? EVERYTHING'S GOING TO HELL. LISTEN, I'VE TOLD YOU OVER AND OVER-- SHE'S NO DEMON. SHE'S MY WIFE. BUT THE SPIDER WEB USED IN THE ATTACK WAS DEFINITELY A PRODUCT OF GEHENNA. IF SHE'S NOT A DEMON, THEN SHE'S POSSESSED BY ONE. SHE'S NOT. [ DOOR OPENS ] [ RIN ] SO YOU WERE LYING? HMM? YOU TOLD ME SATAN KILLED YOUR FAMILY, REMEMBER? SO HOW CAN A DEAD PERSON BE WALKING AROUND, AND WHY WOULD SHE ATTACK MY FRIENDS? ANSWER ME! SHE'S AN ANTISOUL, HUH? ANTISOUL? [ TSUBAKI ] IT'S A TECHNIQUE TO REVIVE A DEAD HUMAN. REMEMBER? I BELIEVE I TAUGHT YOU THAT IN CLASS. OH. YEAH. THAT THING. ALL RIGHT, LOOK. WE ALREADY KNOW YOU RAN A LAB IN POLAND... THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH OF ARTIFICIAL LIFE. SO DROP THE ACT, 'KAY? YOU USED PROHIBITED TECHNOLOGY TO RESURRECT YOUR DEAD WIFE. STOP WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME AND JUST ADMIT IT. - IT WASN'T ME, DAMN IT. - [ ALL GASP ] I ADMIT I KEPT MY WIFE'S BODY CRYOGENICALLY PRESERVED, BUT I'D NEVER RETURN HER SOUL TO IT. THAT'S A LINE THAT I WOULD NEVER CROSS. IF I DID, I'D BE TURNED AWAY FROM THE GATES OF HEAVEN. IF IT WASN'T YOU, THEN WHO WAS IT? I DON'T KNOW. BUT ONE NIGHT AT THE LAB-- [ VEHICLE APPROACHING ] [ ENGINE SHUTS OFF ] I CAME BACK TO CHECK ON HER AS I ALWAYS DID, BUT THIS TIME HER CRYO TUBE WAS OPEN. ♪♪ [ WOMAN SINGING, FAINT ] [ GASPS ] [ PANTING ] ♪♪ [ SINGING CONTINUES, LOUDER ] ♪♪ [ CONTINUES ] [ GASPS ] MICHELLE. DID YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY, MY DARLING? [ NOIHAUS ] RIGHT AWAY I KNEW... HER BODY HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY A DEMON. BUT THE THOUGHT OF KILLING HER WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME TO BEAR. I COULDN'T LET HER SUFFER THE PAIN OF DEATH AGAIN. NO! [ GASPING ] MICHELLE! IGOR NOIHAUS, YOU ARE UNDER ARREST... FOR RESEARCHING ARTIFICIAL LIFE AND RESURRECTING THE DEAD. - WHAT? - BURN IT. BURN EVERYTHING TO THE GROUND. [ GASPS ] OH. [ SCREAMING ] MICHELLE! [ SCREAMING ] [ NOIHAUS ] WE MANAGED TO ESCAPE. I USED A KEY, AND WE FLED TO JAPAN. BUT THINGS DIDN'T GET BETTER. I COULD TELL SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH HER. [ GASPS ] [ GASPS ] [ SCREAMING ] NO! [ GASPS ] MICHELLE! IT'S SO HOT! IT'S SO HOT! SAVE ME! IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M HERE. YOU'RE SAFE. [ WHIMPERING ] [ NOIHAUS ] I THINK THAT WAS THE MOMENT MICHELLE REMEMBERED... BURNING TO DEATH IN THE BLUE FLAMES. - [ THUNDERCLAP ] - [ GASPS ] [ SCREAMING ] [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] I WON'T FORGIVE ANYONE INVOLVED WITH SATAN. THEY'LL ALL DIE A BLOODY DEATH. [ THUNDERCLAP ] [ NOIHAUS ] MICHELLE HAD BECOME A DEMON OF VENGEANCE. I WANTED TO TAKE HER BACK TO THE LAB BEFORE SHE WAS CAUGHT, BUT HERE I AM. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US ALL THIS BEFORE? EVEN IF I DID, YOU BASTARDS COULDN'T SAVE HER. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH, SHE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT ANYWAY. EVEN THOUGH SHE'S POSSESSED BY A DEMON, SHE'S STILL NOTHING BUT A CORPSE. IN A FEW DAYS SHE'LL ROT AWAY LIKE EVERYTHING. [ GRUNTS ] HMM? HOLD UP. RIN! [ SHURA ] WHERE ARE YOU GOING? [ FOOTSTEPS RUNNING ] YOU KNOW DAMN WELL. I'M GOING AFTER MR. NOIHAUS'S WIFE. OH, YEAH? AND THEN WHAT? - WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT ANYTHING? - I DON'T KNOW. BUT I CAN'T STAY HERE AND DO NOTHING. [ SIGHS ] FOOLS RUSH IN WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD. HUH? LOOK, I ALREADY GOT MY FAMILIAR OUT LOOKING FOR HER. AND TAKE THIS. YOU'LL NEED MY TALISMAN TO GUIDE YOU. THANKS A LOT, SHURA. HUH? THAT'S "MS." SHURA. NOW GET THE HELL OUT. JUST REMEMBER, AS SOON AS YOU FIND HER, CALL. AND DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT TAKING HER ON BY YOURSELF. RIGHT. [ SHURA, THINKING ] I WONDER. WHO THE HELL WOULD RESURRECT NOIHAUS'S WIFE? [ RAIN FALLING ] [ RIN, THINKING ] HMM. I MADE IT THIS FAR, BUT HOW DO I USE THIS THING? MAYBE I SHOULD CALL AND ASK? YOU'RE SUCH A USELESS FRIGGIN' KNUCKLE-DRAGGING MORON! SHE'D KILL ME FOR SURE. [ CELL PHONE RINGING ] [ SCREAMS ] UH, HELLO? OKUMURA HERE. - [ SHIEMI ] RIN. - SHIEMI? - HEY, WHAT'S UP? - I NEED YOUR HELP WITH SOMETHING. YES. AND HURRY. GOTCHA. I'M ON THE WAY. [ GROANS ] [ GASPING ] [ SQUEAKING ] WHAT'S THIS? [ SHIEMI ] YOU'RE AWAKE. THANK GOODNESS. - HUH? - TRY NOT TO OVEREXERT YOURSELF, OKAY? WHERE AM I? HOW DID I GET HERE? - I DON'T REMEMBER. - I FOUND YOU IN MY GARDEN. YOU WERE UNCONSCIOUS. I COULDN'T CARRY YOU, BUT IT WASN'T A PROBLEM FOR HIM. NEE! I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. OH, NOBODY SPECIAL. JUST AN EXORCIST IN TRAINING, IS ALL. AN EXORCIST. HELLO? ANYBODY HO-- NOPE. NO ONE'S HOME. AND AFTER COMING ALL THE WAY OUT HERE. NEE-EE! OH. HEY, WHAT UP? IS SHIEMI AROUND? NEE!

THAT MEANS SHE'S HERE. THIS WAS MY GRANDMA'S SECRET GARDEN. SHE LEFT IT TO ME TO TAKE CARE OF. - OH. - MY GRANDMA USED TO ALWAYS TELL ME... THAT IF I JUST STOPPED AND LISTENED TO WHAT THE PLANTS WERE SAYING, THEY'D BE SURE TO BLOSSOM. AND YOU KNOW? SHE WAS RIGHT. THERE'S NO DOUBT GRANDMA COULD HEAR THEIR VOICES. LOOK AROUND. IT'S AMAZING TO THINK HOW MUCH ALL THE FAIRIES IN THE GARDEN LOVED HER. BUT THEN MY GRANDMA WAS AN AMAZING PERSON. OH! I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO GO ON AND ON LIKE THAT. THE GARDEN OF AMAHARA WOULD BE LIKE. I GUESS THIS IS WHAT HUH? MY HUSBAND TOLD ME ABOUT IT ONCE. HE SAID IT'S A PLACE GOD MADE... WHERE ALL THE PLANTS IN THE WORLD HAD BEEN GATHERED. IF THERE REALLY IS A GARDEN LIKE THAT, I'M SURE IT WOULD BE A LOT LIKE HERE. UM, IF YOU WANT, COULD WE BE FRIENDS? BESIDES GRANDMA, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I'VE MET... WHO KNOWS ABOUT THE GARDEN OF AMAHARA. MM. YOUR HANDS ARE SO WARM. UM, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? MY NAME? MY NAME IS SHIEMI MORIYAMA. - I'M MICHELLE. - SHIEMI. - [ GASPS ] - RIN? GET AWAY FROM HER RIGHT NOW! [ GASPING ] STAY BACK! - LET HER GO! - SO YOU'RE WITH SATAN TOO. I SHOULD'VE GUESSED. HUH? SHIEMI'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE. EVERYTHING I EVER LOVED WAS BURNED TO ASHES. BLUE FLAMES BURNED IT ALL AWAY! I WON'T FORGIVE SATAN FOR THAT. HE TOOK EVERYTHING I LOVED AWAY FROM ME, AND TO MAKE HIM PAY, I'M GOING TO-- I'LL TAKE... EVERYTHING AWAY FROM YOU. I SWEAR.
