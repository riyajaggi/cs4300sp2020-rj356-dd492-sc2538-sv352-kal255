USUALLY ONE CAN ACQUIRE THE STUDY OF ITS METHODOLOGY AND VARIOUS USES ARE COMPILED IN GRIMOIRES. NOW, GRIMOIRES HAVE A LONG HISTORY. EARLY IN THE 13TH CENTURY, A PAMPHLET ON DEMONOLOGY... WAS PUBLISHED BY WILLIAM, THE BISHOP OF AUVERGNE. [ SNORING ] THE GRIMOIRE YOU HAVE IS CALLED THE LEMEGETON, OF SOLOMON." [ GROWLING ] AKA "THE LESSER KEY ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

WHY DO YOU GOT THAT SPARKLY LOOK IN YOUR EYES? BECAUSE I KNOW I DID WELL ON THE QUIZ. OH, RIGHT. YOUR FAMILY'S ALL PHARMACISTS. MM-HMM. WE SPECIALIZE IN THAT STUFF. THIS IS THE ONE THING I KNOW I'M GOOD AT. - MORIYAMA? - [ GASPS ] YES! WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "MR. SANCHO"? UM, YOU PEEL THE LEAVES AND APPLY IT TO BURNS? SO YOU'RE REFERRING TO ALOE? AND WHAT IS "MR. HOMILEY"? A YELLOW POWDER USED AS AN ANTISEPTIC. AH, YOU MEAN TURMERIC. I DON'T MIND IF YOU ASSIGN YOUR OWN NAMES TO PLANTS, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO USE THEIR PROPER NAMES. BUT IN THE FUTURE, OKAY. [ LAUGHING ] YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD IT NAILED. OKUMURA. YOU'RE GIVING ME AN ULCER. SORRY, TEACH. SUGURO? YES, SIR.

ALL YOUR HARD WORK PAID OFF, SUGURO. [ CHORTLES ] [ GASPS ] WHAT THE HELL? SERIOUSLY? HOW CAN A PUNK ROCK REJECT LIKE YOU GET A 98? WHAT'D YOU SAY? LISTEN, YOU LOSER-- I CAME TO THIS SCHOOL BECAUSE I'M SERIOUS ABOUT BECOMING AN EXORCIST. MM-HMM, MM-HMM. AND EVERYONE HERE IS STUDYING HARD... BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE EXORCISTS TOO. YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS ABOUT IT, SO DROP OUT. GET LOST. HEY, WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE TELLING ME TO GET LOST? BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I'M HERE 'CAUSE I WANNA BECOME AN EXORCIST TOO. OH, YEAH? HOW? BY STUDYING IN BETWEEN YOUR NAPS? BON, TAKE IT EASY. COME ON, BON, WE'RE IN CLASS. MAYBE YOU'D DO BETTER IF YOU ACTUALLY PAID ATTENTION IN CLASS. I LEARN BY BEING OUT IN THE FIELD. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SIT AROUND ALL DAY MEMORIZING STUFF. YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT IDEA, SUGURO. GO AHEAD, TELL HIM OFF SOME MORE. [ GRUNTS ] WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON ANYWAY, HUH? WANNA TAKE A QUIZ AND FIND OUT? [ BELLS CHIMING ] AND AS IF ON CUE. THAT'S IT FOR TODAY, CLASS. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT GUY? HE REALLY THAT SMART? OH, YOU MEAN, SUGURO? HE'S A PRODIGY. HE'S ATTENDING THE ACADEMY ON A SCHOLARSHIP LIKE I AM. I HEARD HE'S THE HEIR TO AN HONORABLE AND HISTORIC TEMPLE IN KYOTO. FIGURES. HE'S JUST SOME RICH KID. HE'S AN EXCEPTIONAL STUDENT, AN ACCOMPLISHED ATHLETE, AND HE PAYS ATTENTION DURING CLASS. TRUTH IS HE WORKS WAY HARDER THAN YOU, RIN. MAYBE YOU SHOULD CLONE HIS MIND. YOU COULD LEARN A LESSON OR TWO FROM HIM. MIND CLONING-- WHATEVER. I'M NOT THAT STUPID. SO ANYWAY, HOW ARE YOU DOING? HAVE YOU GOTTEN USED TO SCHOOL YET? OH, UH, NOT REALLY. NO. IF YOU ASK ME, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE GOTTEN MORE CONFIDENT THAN YOU WERE BEFORE. YOU LOOK LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON NOW. TAKE IT EASY, AND JUST DO YOUR BEST. OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THE TIP, YUKI.

CAN'T JUST SIT HERE. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT? UH, SO, UH, WHICH CLASS ARE YOU IN AGAIN? HUH? NOT THE CRAM SCHOOL. THE REGULAR SCHOOL. MM-MM. I ONLY ASKED IF I COULD GET INTO THE CRAM SCHOOL. WHAT ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL? OH, I'M TOO SHY TO HANDLE THAT. I BARELY WENT TO MY CLASSES IN JUNIOR HIGH. YEAH, I HARDLY WENT TO JUNIOR HIGH EITHER. YOU COULD SAY I HAD A HARD TIME FITTING IN. [ CHUCKLES ] HEY, RIN? HUH? BE HONEST. I DON'T REALLY BELONG IN THIS CRAM SCHOOL, DO I? - HUH? WHY? - BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY WANNA BECOME... AN EXORCIST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. I'D HAVE TO BE AS SMART AS SUGURO, AND I KNOW I'LL NEVER BE. SURE, I GUESS IT'S COOL HAVING A BIG BRAIN LIKE THAT AND ALL, BUT YOU'RE OKAY THE WAY YOU ARE. THE WORLD NEEDS ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE ANYWAY. RIN? DO YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS? HUH? [ STAMMERING ] UM, LISTEN, I-- RIN, WILL YOU-- WELL, WELL. LOOK AT THESE TWO LOVEBIRDS MAKING OUT. [ STAMMERING ] WE'RE NOT MAKING OUT! SHE'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, ISN'T SHE? AND GETTING HER INTO THE MOST ELITE SCHOOL FOR EXORCISTS-- YOU MUST BE A BIG SHOT. YOU GOT THE WRONG IDEA ABOUT US, MAN.

WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU AFRAID OF BEING ALONE? [ LAUGHING ] WHAT'S SO FUNNY, SHIMA? HE'S RIGHT. WE'RE ALWAYS TOGETHER. [ LAUGHING ] HEY, MAN, DON'T TAKE HIS SIDE. [ BOTH GROWLING ] THIS GUY'S PISSING ME OFF. THIS GUY'S SO ANNOYING. [ SHIMA ] WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THEY'RE KIND OF THE SAME. [ MIWA ] THEY'RE SO ALIKE, THEY REPEL EACH OTHER. [ BELL CHIMING ] [ BOTH SHOUTING ] [ MAN ] GENTLEMEN, THIS IS NOT A RACE, UNDERSTAND? THE GOAL OF THIS EXERCISE IS TO GET YOU USED TO HOW THE DEMON MOVES. ANTICIPATE THE REAPER'S ACTIONS. [ RIN ] I CAN'T LOSE TO THIS GUY. [ SUGURO ] HOLY CRAP, HE'S FAST. BON'S ONE OF THE FASTEST RUNNERS I KNOW. THAT KID'S KEEPING PACE LIKE A CHAMP. YOU'RE LAGGING, ROOSTER BOY. BEING SMART DOESN'T DO YOU MUCH GOOD IN THE REAL WORLD, DOES IT? WHAT'D YOU SAY? YOU DON'T KNOW JACK! IN THE REAL WORLD, THE GUY LEFT STANDING AT THE END WINS. NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING-- [ ROARS ] [ SCREAMS ] WHOA! ARE YOU TRYING TO GET YOURSELVES KILLED? WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU? [ BOTH PANTING ] WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? I'D RATHER DIE THAN LOSE TO A SCUMBAG LIKE YOU. YOU WANNA DIE? HOW ABOUT NOW? ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS! COME ON! THAT'S ENOUGH! YOU'RE DISRUPTING CLASS. HEY, GET AHOLD OF YOURSELVES. STOP FIGHTING. SORRY, SIR. SORRY. WHAT AN IDIOT. [ GIGGLES ] SUGURO, I'D LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU. YES, SIR. MAN, WHAT IS UP WITH HIM? [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH, SORRY. BON'S A GOOD GUY, BUT HE'S SO SERIOUS... THAT IT'S KINDA HARD FOR HIM TO CUT PEOPLE SLACK. THE WHOLE REASON HE'S HERE IS BECAUSE OF HIS BIG AMBITIONS. - AMBITIONS? - NOW LOOK HERE, SUGURO. YOU'RE ONE OF THE BEST STUDENTS WE HAVE AT THE ACADEMY. ALL THE TEACHERS ARE EXPECTING GREAT THINGS FROM YOU. IT WOULD BE IN YOUR BEST INTEREST TO AVOID CAUSING ANY TROUBLE. PARDON ME, SIR, BUT WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE GETTING LECTURED? - IF THERE'S A FIGHT, BOTH PARTIES ARE TO BLAME. - HMM? SO ISN'T RIN OKUMURA JUST AS GUILTY AS I AM? WELL, THE DIRECTOR WAS THE ONE WHO ENROLLED HIM. PEOPLE SAY HE'S GOT SPECIAL ISSUES. YOU'RE BETTER OFF IF YOU DON'T GET INVOLVED WITH HIM. [ HUFFS ] SPECIAL ISSUES, MY ASS. AN EXORCIST BECAUSE HE SAYS HE WANTS TO DEFEAT SATAN. THE THING IS, BON WANTS TO BE [ GASPS ] I'M GONNA BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF SATAN! CRAP, HE'S... JUST LIKE ME. [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH, IT'S KINDA FUNNY, ISN'T IT? UH, WHAT'S SO FUNNY ABOUT IT? [ LAUGHS ] HUH? IT ISN'T FUNNY. THE WHOLE THING ABOUT BON AND WHY HE'S SO INTENSE... IS THAT HE WANTS TO RESTORE OUR TEMPLE. IT WAS ALL BUT RUINED AFTER THE BLUE NIGHT. BLUE NIGHT? WHAT'S THAT? HUH? YOU DON'T KNOW? YOU'RE LIKE THE ONLY ONE WHO DOESN'T. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. SIXTEEN YEARS AGO SATAN CROSSED THE BARRIER TO OUR WORLD... AND MASSACRED ALL THE TOP CLERGYMEN. WE'VE CALLED IT THE BLUE NIGHT EVER SINCE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "MASSACRED"? WE HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED FROM BON'S FATHER. HE WAS THE HEAD MONK OF OUR TEMPLE. SIXTEEN YEARS AGO, THE MOST POWERFUL EXORCISTS STARTED BLEEDING ALL OVER. FROM THEIR HEADS, AND THEN THEY ALL DIED. BLUE FLAMES SHOT THE BLUE FLAMES ARE A SURE SIGN THAT SATAN'S AROUND. OUR MONK, WHO WAS YOUNG AND STILL IN TRAINING, WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO FIGHT BACK. HE JUST HID IN A CORNER TILL DAWN, PRAYING. AFTER THAT NIGHT, HE FINISHED HIS TRAINING AND TOOK OVER THE TEMPLE. BUT FOLKS WERE STILL FREAKED OUT BY WHAT HAPPENED. SO PARISHIONERS STOPPED COMING, AND, AS WORD GOT AROUND, EVEN VISITORS STOPPED SHOWING UP. AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WERE CALLING IT THE CURSED TEMPLE. SHIMA AND I ARE APPRENTICE MONKS AT BON'S TEMPLE. WE FOLLOWED HIM TO THE ACADEMY THINKING WE COULD BECOME EXORCISTS... AND HELP HIM TO RESTORE IT TO ITS FORMER GLORY. BON'S GOT A FULL PLATE. THAT'S WHY HE'S SO INTENSE. BUT HE'S A GOOD GUY ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM. THE BOY FROM THE CURSED TEMPLE, HUH? [ LOUD THUDS ] [ PANTING ] [ SCREAMS ] EXCUSE ME, HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU GOING TO TRIP? - I'M SORRY, SIR. - IS THERE A REASON... WHY YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN CLASS NOT WEARING SWEATS? I, UH, I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE I CAN WEAR FOR SPORTS. THAT OUTFIT WAS FASHIONABLE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. SHIMA AND YAMADA, YOU'RE UP NEXT. OKAY. YOU MIND IF I GO UP AHEAD OF YOU? THANKS. OH, SURE. [ THUDDING ] YOU WERE RUNNING PRETTY HARD. WHATEVER. I'M NOT EVEN TIRED. OH, IZUMO, YOU CRACK ME UP. OH. [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] WHOSE FREAKING PHONE'S GOING OFF? HELLO? TSUBAKI HERE. [ GROANS ] I'M TEACHING CLASS RIGHT NOW, HONEY. WHAT? RIGHT NOW? YOU'RE INSATIABLE. I'M ON MY WAY, MY LITTLE KITTY CAT. OKAY, CLASS, WE'RE TAKING A BREAK FOR A BIT. - [ ALL ] HUH? - LISTEN UP NOW. MOST OF THE TIME, THE REAPER IS A PEACEFUL DEMON. PEOPLE'S MINDS AND ATTACK WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT. HOWEVER, THEY CAN READ UNTIL I GET BACK, YOU ARE TO STAY CLEAR OF THE REAPER'S CHAINS. SCRATCH THAT. YOU ARE NOT TO ENTER THE ARENA. WE CLEAR? GOOD. THEN I'M OUTTA HERE. I'M ON MY WAY, KITTY CAT! YOU HEAR THAT? TEACHER JUST CALLED SOMEONE A KITTY CAT. WE'RE TAKING A BREAK FOR A BOOTY CALL. ARE TEACHERS ALLOWED TO DO THAT? UNBELIEVABLE. AND HE CALLS HIMSELF A TEACHER. TRUE CROSS ACADEMY IS SUPPOSED TO BE THIS AMAZING PLACE... WHERE ONLY THE HIGHLY MOTIVATED GATHER-- WHAT B.S. EVEN THE STUDENTS SUCK HERE. SERIOUSLY, GUY, WOULD YOU JUST DROP IT ALREADY? I GOT MY REASONS BEING HERE TOO, SO HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT MOTIVATED? I CAN TELL BY THE WAY YOU ACT IN CLASS. OH, BROTHER. HERE THEY GO AGAIN. [ TSUBAKI ] THE DIRECTOR WAS THE ONE WHO ENROLLED HIM. PEOPLE SAY HE'S GOT SPECIAL ISSUES. [ SUGURO ] YOU'RE JUST A SPOILED RICH KID GETTING A FREE RIDE. COME ON, BON, YOU'RE BEING IMMATURE. PLEASE, JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE. SHUT UP, BOTH OF YOU. I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. YOU SAY YOU'RE MOTIVATED? OKAY, FINE. HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO PROVE IT. OH, YEAH? HOW AM I GONNA PROVE IT? WITH THAT. IF YOU CAN TOUCH IT AND GET BACK HERE WITHOUT GETTING ATTACKED, YOU WIN. HUH? WHEN A REAPER LOOKS INTO YOUR EYES, IT'S GONNA TRY TO READ WHATEVER YOU'RE THINKING. FEAR AND ANGER, SADNESS AND JEALOUSY. WHATEVER IT FINDS, IT USES, AND IF YOU LOOK AWAY, YOU'RE DEAD... BECAUSE IT'LL PICK THAT MOMENT TO ATTACK. THE DEAL IS IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT BECOMING AN EXORCIST, YOU WON'T LOSE YOUR COOL OVER A LITTLE OLD REAPER. IF YOU MAKE IT BACK HERE IN ONE PIECE, IT'LL PROVE YOU'RE NOT MESSING AROUND, AND I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE. WAIT, BON-- AND I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT TOO. THERE'S NO WAY I COULD LOSE. WELL? YOU GONNA DO IT OR WHAT? HMM. SOUNDS LIKE FUN. SURE. I'LL DO IT. - [ CHUCKLES ] - YEAH, RIGHT. LIKE HELL I WILL, YOU DUMBASS. [ GASPS ] YOU THINK I'M CRAZY? WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS AND I GET KILLED? YEAH, 'CAUSE I CAN'T USE MY SWORD IN FRONT OF THESE GUYS. BESIDES, IF WE'RE TALKING AMBITION, I GOT THE SAME AS YOU. I'M NOT GONNA RISK MY LIFE JUST SO I CAN PROVE IT TO YOU THOUGH. WHAT THE-- [ GASPS ] DID YOU GUYS TELL HIM? WELL-- AMBITION, MY ASS. YOU'RE USING THAT AS AN EXCUSE TO CHICKEN OUT. - SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT, GUY. - DAMN YOU. DAMN ALL OF YOU, MAKING ME LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT. DAMN YOU ALL! IT'S THE BOY FROM THE CURSED TEMPLE. DON'T GO NEAR HIM OR YOU'LL GET CURSED TOO. [ WOMAN ] I'M SORRY, WE CAN'T. MAYBE IF YOU ASKED ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS. SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU. [ MAN ] NO APOLOGIES NECESSARY, MA'AM. DAD! HUH? [ MAN ] WHO WAS THAT? [ WOMAN ] IT WAS THAT MONK FROM THE CURSED TEMPLE COLLECTING OFFERINGS. I WAS SCARED TO OPEN THE DOOR. IF ONLY THAT DAMN TEMPLE WOULD JUST COLLAPSE ALREADY. [ MAN ] [ GRUNTS ] [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S A BIT HARSH, WOULDN'T YOU SAY? WHY? WHY IS HE LAUGHING? RYUGI, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE OVER THE TEMPLE FROM ME. LIVE YOUR LIFE THE WAY YOU WANT. HOW CAN YOU JUST TURN YOUR BACK? OUR TEMPLE IS RUINED BECAUSE OF WHAT SATAN DID. I HATE THIS! - RYUGI-- - I'M GONNA STUDY HARD AND BECOME A GREAT EXORCIST. I'LL DEFEAT SATAN, THEN I'M GONNA REBUILD THE TEMPLE. [ LAUGHS ] DEFEAT SATAN, HUH? SOMETIMES YOU SAY THE FUNNIEST THINGS. I'M NOT JOKING! I MEAN IT! WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING? WHY DOESN'T ANYONE FIGHT BACK? DOESN'T THIS PISS YOU OFF? I'M GONNA DO IT. STAND THERE AND WATCH ME. HEY, WAIT. DON'T GO DOWN THERE. - [ SHIMA AND MIWA ] BON! - IS HE REALLY GONNA DO IT? OH, HE'S NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING. THIS IS SO LAME. NO WAY. NOT ME. I'M NOT A COWARD LIKE YOU. I'M GONNA BE A REAL EXORCIST SOMEDAY. AND I'LL DEFEAT SATAN! [ LAUGHS ] DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID? HE'S GONNA DEFEAT SATAN. SERIOUSLY? [ KAMIKI LAUGHS ] [ HUFFS ] [ LAUGHING ] I WON'T LET YOU LAUGH AT ME... ANYMORE! [ ROARING ] - AH, CRAP! - BON! - HEY! - [ RIN ] LET GO. I SAID LET GO! [ SUGURO ] WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? ARE YOU INSANE? HUH? LISTEN UP. HERE'S THE DEAL. I'M THE ONE WHO'S GONNA DEFEAT SATAN, SO STAY OUT OF MY WAY! HUH? WHAT THE HELL? YOU'RE INSANE! MAN, YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN KILLED. AND DON'T COPY MY AMBITION! HUH? I DIDN'T COPY YOU. IT WAS MINE FIRST. I DECIDED I WAS GONNA DO IT BEFORE YOU DID. [ SUGURO ] NO, IT WASN'T. [ RIN ] WHEN? WHAT YEAR, WHAT MONTH? WHAT DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND? HOW MANY TIMES DID THE PLANETS SPIN THAT DAY? WHAT ARE YOU, A KID? LOOK WHO'S TALKING. [ BOTH GROWLING ] [ YUKIO ] YES. EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL NOW. EVERYONE'S SAFE. NO. HE DID NOT DRAW THE KURIKARA SWORD. TALK TO YOU LATER. [ BEEPS ] [ SIGHS ] ONCE UNLEASHED, THE POWER OF SATAN...
