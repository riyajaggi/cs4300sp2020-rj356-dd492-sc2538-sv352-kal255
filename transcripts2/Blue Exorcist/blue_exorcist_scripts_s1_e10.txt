 I MEAN, HE'S GONNA FIND OUT AT SOME POINT, YOU KNOW? SHH. KEEP IT DOWN, DUMMY. HE'LL HEAR. RIGHT. SORRY. HE'S SO FAR AWAY, I DIDN'T THINK HE'D HEAR ME. ANYWAY, MY GUESS IS IT'D BE LIKE LETTING A DOG OFF ITS LEASH. HE'LL GO BACK TO BEING THE DEMON HE WAS. THEN HE'LL BECOME A PROBLEM. ♪♪ [ MAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] [ DOOR OPENS ] - OH, YOU'RE BACK. - EVERYTHING WAS SOLD OUT AT THE SHOP ON CAMPUS. I HAD TO GO TO THE OTHER ONE. GEEZ, CAN THIS ROOM GET ANY HOTTER? I MEAN, IT'S A RICH KIDS' SCHOOL, SO GET SOME A.C. UP IN HERE, YOU KNOW? THIS BUILDING IS REALLY OLD, SO IT CAN'T BE HELPED. WE CAN DEAL WITH THIS. IT'S NOT LIKE WE GREW UP WITH AIR CONDITIONING ANYWAY. WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH THE FAN. I WAS JUST SAYING. NO, NEVER MIND, RIN. - WHERE'S THE MINERAL WATER I ASKED FOR? - HUH? OH, CRAP. I FORGOT. I MEAN, WATER. IT'S TRANSPARENT, SO IT'S EASY TO MISS. HEY, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE AN ICE POP? NYUM-NYUM. YOU GOT TWO ICE POPS, NO WATER. NO, THANKS. I'LL GET THE WATER MYSELF LATER ON. [ SIGHS ] FINE. WHATEVER. [ WRAPPER CRACKLING ] [ GROANING ] OH, MAN. SPENDING A SUNDAY AFTERNOON STUCK INDOORS DOING HOMEWORK TOTALLY SUCKS. AND AFTER ALL I WENT THROUGH TO MAKE IT TO EXWIRE. THIS AIN'T NO DIFFERENT THAN BEING A PAGE. ACCORDING TO THIS HERE CHART, EXWIRE'S NOTHING BUT A BOTTOM FEEDER. WHICH ONE OF THESE IS YOU ANYWAY? INTERMEDIATE FIRST CLASS. HMM, INTERMEDIATE FIRST CLASS. THAT'S IT? GUESS YOU'RE NOT A HOTSHOT AFTER ALL. OH, YEAH? WELL, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK. HUH? I BET IT TAKES FOREVER AND A HALF TO GET UP... TO THIS PALADIN THINGY AT THE TOP, DOESN'T IT? TO GO ON MISSIONS AND GET SOME REAL EXPERIENCE. MAN, I CAN'T WAIT THE RANK OF PALADIN IS ONLY AWARDED TO ONE VERY EXCEPTIONAL EXORCIST. HUH? THEY DON'T JUST GIVE IT TO ANYONE, YOU KNOW. AND NO. WE'RE NOT SENDING YOU ON ANY MISSIONS ANY TIME SOON. - HUH? - THAT'S RIGHT. YOU IGNORE ORDERS AND ACT LIKE A LOOSE CANNON, NOT TO MENTION YOU CAN'T EVEN MANAGE TO RUN A SIMPLE ERRAND. CAN YOU BLAME US? WHAT THE HELL? I SAID I'M SORRY. IT'S NOT JUST THAT. IT'S THE WAY YOU FIGHT. YOU RELY TOO MUCH ON SATAN'S POWER. DURING A FIGHT, YOU SHOULDN'T BE SO QUICK TO DRAW YOUR SWORD. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW FAST YOU HEAL. YOUR BODY AS A SHIELD WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF OPTIONS. YOU CAN'T KEEP USING IF YOU KEEP DOING THINGS LIKE THAT, WELL, THEN, SATAN'S POWER WILL COMPLETELY CONSUME YOU. WHAT? WHO GIVES A DAMN HOW I DID IT? IT WORKED, AND EVERYONE WAS SAFE. YOU SOUND LIKE THE OLD MAN LECTURING ME. BESIDES, YOU ALMOST GOT KILLED TOO. I'M TELLING YOU THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO HELP YOU. DAD WOULD WANT THE SAME THING. I'D IMAGINE HE'S SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE RIGHT NOW WORRYING ABOUT YOU. YEAH, RIGHT. LIKE THAT OLD FART EVER CARED THAT MUCH ABOUT ANYTHING I DID. OLD FART, HUH? WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO STOP ACTING LIKE SOME REBELLIOUS TEENAGER? DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU GREW UP? OH, YEAH? WELL, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA STOP ACTING LIKE SOME BIG SHOT? WALKING AROUND LIKE YOU'RE THE MAN 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALL BRAINY AND STUFF. - AND SHIEMI'S CRUSHING ON YOU. - HUH? WHAT DOES SHIEMI HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING I'M TALKING ABOUT? BESIDES, SHE'S NOT CRUSHING ON ME, AND I DO NOT WALK AROUND LIKE I'M THE MAN. OH, MY GOD! SHE TOTALLY IS. YOU'VE GOT FOUR EYES, FOUR-EYES. HOW COME YOU CAN'T SEE THAT? YOU'VE GOTTA BE ONE HELL OF A MORON. I AM A MORON, HUH? I WONDER WHAT THAT MAKES YOU THEN, SEEING AS HOW YOU CAN'T EVEN RUN A SIMPLE ERRAND. OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE STILL WHINING ABOUT THAT. YOUR FIGHTING IS SLOPPY. YOU USE BRUTE FORCE BECAUSE YOU LACK KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL. WHY DON'T YOU TRY USING YOUR HEAD FOR A CHANGE? FOUR-EYED PIECE OF CRAP! [ LAUGHS ] LOOK AT THAT. THEY LANDED PERFECTLY. WHAT IN THE HELL IS SO FREAKING FUNNY? - [ GASPS ] - [ VIBRATES ] OKUMURA SPEAKING. RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY NOW. IS THAT A MISSION? IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. [ GROWLS ] HE'S GOT A BUTTLOAD OF SPARES. [ CAT HISSES, SNARLS ] YUKIO OKUMURA, INTERMEDIATE EXORCIST FIRST CLASS. WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU. AND I'M RIN OKUMURA, EXWIRE. NO CLASS. UH-UH. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. JUST MAKING SURE YOU DON'T BREAK YOUR SECOND PAIR OF GLASSES. WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY? I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY THESE GAMES OF YOURS RIGHT NOW. - GO AWAY. - TOUGH SHIT. [ LAUGHS ] [ HISSING, SNARLING ] THIS WAY, PLEASE. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR ME? KURO THE CAT SI THAT GUARDS THE SOUTH GATE HAS GONE BERSERK. WE'VE SET UP A PERIMETER AND LOCKED DOWN THE REAR GATE ROAD. [ HISSING ] [ KURO ] YOU LIARS! YOU'RE ALL LIARS! [ YUKIO ] ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? WHAT HAPPENED? KURO SUDDENLY GREW BIG LIKE THAT, THEN HE ATTACKED US. WE WERE TALKING, AND I GUESS WE SORT OF LET IT SLIP... THAT FATHER FUJIMOTO HAD DIED. AND, WELL, I THINK HE HEARD US. I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME, I WAS WONDERING WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO KURO. DON'T WORRY. WE EXORCISTS ARE GOING TO TAKE HIM DOWN. SERIOUSLY? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHAT DOES THAT CAT OR ANY OF THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE OLD MAN'S DEATH? THAT CAT IS CALLED A CAT SI. IT WAS DAD'S FAMILIAR. WHAT THE HELL'S A CAT SI ANYWAY? YOU'RE KIDDING. A DEMON THAT POSSESSES CATS. THE ONES IN JAPAN ARE UNIQUE, BECAUSE IF THEY LIVE LONG ENOUGH, THEY DEVELOP THAT SPLIT TAIL. THIS PARTICULAR ONE USED TO LIVE IN A PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT CULTIVATED SILK, AND FOR CENTURIES HE WAS THE GUARDIAN DEITY OF SILKWORMS. HE LIVED PEACEFULLY AMONG HUMANS, AND PROTECTED SILKWORMS FROM MICE AND OTHER PREDATORS. THE PEOPLE OF THE COMMUNITY WORSHIPPED HIM IN THEIR SHRINE. BUT AS THE TIMES CHANGED AND SILKWORM BREEDING DIED OUT, THE PEOPLE FORGOT ABOUT THEIR GUARDIAN AND ALL HE'D DONE FOR THEM. AND THEN-- HAVING LOST HIS HOME, HE BECAME A DEMON. [ SNARLING ] NOW! RIGHT. - [ SNARLS ] - OH, CRAP. IT DIDN'T WORK. LIARS! YOU'RE ALL LIARS! LIARS! [ HISSING, SNARLING ] [ SHOUTING ] [ SNARLING ] WHAT'S THE SITUATION? OKUMURA? WE TRIED HOLY WATER, HOLY WINE, SILVER, HERBS-- NOTHING'S WORKING. WE CAN'T USE AN ARIA ON IT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE... TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ITS FATAL VERSE IS YET. WE PUMPED HIM FULL OF TRANQUILIZERS, SO HE'S WEAK. HE'LL SNAP OUT OF IT SOON THOUGH. GOD HELP US WHEN HE DOES. [ GROWLING ] DID FATHER FUJIMOTO EVER TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT KURO? YUKIO, REMEMBER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN WE WENT ON THAT MISSION? YES. WHAT MISSION? HUH? IT WAS BACK WHEN YUKIO WAS STILL AN EXWIRE. A SERIES OF UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA WERE REPORTED... AT A CONSTRUCTION SITE. [ SHOUTING ] [ SCREECHING ] THE LOCALS THOUGHT IT WAS A CURSE, SO THEY BROUGHT IN SOME SHAMAN TO HELP, BUT THEY WERE NO MATCH FOR THE CAT SI. THEN THINGS GOT WORSE. THE LOCALS CALLED IN THE KNIGHTS OF THE TRUE CROSS... OUT OF OPTIONS, AS A LAST RESORT. THE MAN WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO DESTROY THE DEMON... WAS FATHER FUJIMOTO, THE PALADIN. [ GASPS ] I THINK I CAN HANDLE... THIS LITTLE FUR BALL ON MY OWN. HE RESOLVED THE SITUATION WITHOUT RESORTING TO VIOLENCE. HE WAS AMAZING. THE OLD FART WAS A PALADIN? GEEZ, I HAD NO IDEA. AFTER THAT, DAD NAMED HIM KURO AND MADE A CONTRACT WITH HIM... TO BE THE ACADEMY'S RESIDENT GATE KEEPER. ONCE A DEMON, ALWAYS A DEMON. AS SOON AS HE LOSES HIS MASTER, HE REVERTS BACK TO HIS NATURAL HABITS. MY FATHER SUSPECTED THIS WOULD HAPPEN SOMEDAY, SO HE PREPARED THIS. IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENS TO ME AND KURO BECOMES UNMANAGEABLE, I WANT YOU TO USE THIS TO STOP HIM. IT'S SOMETHING I WHIPPED UP ESPECIALLY FOR THAT. USE IT AND HE WILL BE AT PEACE. IT SEEMS TO BE A MODIFIED HAND GRENADE. I SUPPOSE IT'S FILLED WITH SOME MEDICINE THAT WILL KILL HIM. LET'S HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. LISTEN UP, EVERYONE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS THING IS CAPABLE OF, SO I HAVE TO ASK ALL OF YOU TO STEP BACK AND LET ME HANDLE THIS ALONE. [ KURO ] YOU LIARS! LIARS! SHIRO IS THE MOST POWERFUL ONE OF ALL! [ WOMAN ] YOU SURE? [ YUKIO ] I'LL BE FINE. I JUST HAVE TO HIT HIM WITH IT AND IT'S DONE. I'M GOING TO EVACUATE EVERYONE IN CASE THAT THING TURNS OUT TO BE NASTY. RETREAT TO THE REAR GATE, PEOPLE. [ SNARLING ] SHIRO WOULD NEVER DIE! SHIRO WILL COME BACK. HE'S COMING BACK! OH, THAT'S IT. OKAY. YOU'D BETTER GET BACK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEDICINE'S LIKE, AND IT MIGHT HAVE AN EFFECT ON YOU TOO. ARE YOU GONNA KILL HIM? YEAH. THIS SCHOOL DOESN'T HAVE AN EXORCIST ON THE FACULTY... WHO CAN TAME A DEMON OF THAT CLASS. THE WAY HE IS, OUR ONLY OPTION IS TO KILL HIM. [ GROWLING ] SHIRO IS COMING BACK. AND UNTIL HE DOES, I'M NOT GOING TO DIE. GO ON, RIN. TIME TO GET BACK. HOLD UP. WHAT? WELL, ISN'T KILLING HIM KIND OF EXTREME? I THINK HE JUST MIGHT BE SAD, IS ALL. - HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT? - MM, I DON'T KNOW HOW I KNOW. IT'S-- IT'S KINDA LIKE DEMON-TO-DEMON TELEPATHY. LIKE THIS. HMM. EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT, WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE HIM THEN GIVE ME A MINUTE TO TRY TO TALK SOME SENSE INTO HIM. TALK SOME SENSE? YEAH. DON'T WORRY. I WON'T DRAW MY SWORD. I'LL DO WHAT YOU SAID. I'M GONNA USE MY HEAD TO FIGHT HIM INSTEAD. I WON'T USE SATAN'S POWER. HUH? HEY! DON'T YELL! [ SNARLS ] MY NAME'S RIN OKUMURA. I'M SHIRO'S SON. SHIRO'S-- MY FATHER'S DEAD. WAIT, RIN. SHIRO'S DEAD. THAT'S A LIE. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU! - SHIRO'S DEAD! - LIAR! [ ROARS ] STOP LYING TO ME! WHAT? HE ACTUALLY USED HIS HEAD? [ GROANING ] [ SNIFFS ] HUH? IT'S OKAY. I BET YOU REALLY LOVED MY DAD, DIDN'T YOU? [ GASPS ] THOUGHT SO. AND ALL THIS, IT'S JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SAD, ISN'T IT? KNOW WHAT? I'M SAD ABOUT IT TOO. SO HOW ABOUT WE BE FRIENDS? RIN. IT'S OKAY. YOU REALLY LOVED HUMANS, DIDN'T YOU? AND ALL THIS, IT'S ALL JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SAD... THAT THEY FORGOT ABOUT YOU, ISN'T IT, HUH? [ MEOWS ] SO HOW ABOUT WE BE FRIENDS. LOOK. I EVEN MADE YOU SOME SILVER VINE SAKE. [ CONTENTED MEWLING ] [ MEWLING ] SHIRO. [ LAUGHING ] SHIRO! [ LAUGHING ] CAN'T I SEE YOU AGAIN? SHIRO? [ MEOWING ] ARE YOU REALLY DEAD? [ MEOWING ] [ MEOWING CONTINUES ] HUH. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF RIN OKUMURA? AT THIS POINT, I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO GO ON. BESIDES, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM GO ALL OUT IN BATTLE YET. I KNOW. HE'S BEEN CONSISTENT IN THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR. RATHER EXASPERATING IS WHAT IT IS. WELL, WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY ENTICING HIM INTO GOING ALL OUT? YES. BUT BEFORE I DO, I THINK I'LL TRY TO LEARN MORE... ABOUT THIS JAPAN PLACE WHICH YOU SEEM TO BE SO FOND OF. OH. COLOR ME IMPRESSED. JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR, I DID NOT GIVE YOU THE INFINITY KEY... SO YOU COULD GO SIGHTSEEING. SURE. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. [ DOOR CLOSES ] ARE YOU SURE WE CAN TRUST HIM? OH, SURE. HE'LL BE FINE. I'VE-- HOW DO YOU SAY-- PIQUED HIS INTEREST. [ BIRD SQUAWKING ] [ PURRING ] [ YUKIO ] SORRY I'M LATE. HEY. - HE LIKES YOU. - [ MEOWS ] WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO HIM? OH, WELL, I TOLD HIM THAT HE'S BECOME YOUR FAMILIAR. A RATHER CLEVER EXCUSE, IF I MIGHT SAY. THEY'RE GOING TO USE A DIFFERENT FAMILIAR TO GUARD THE REAR SOUTH GATE NOW. [ MEOWS ] - NO, THAT'S POISON! - HEY, THIS SMELLS LIKE A PRESENT FROM SHIRO. UH, HE SAYS THAT THING SMELLS LIKE A PRESENT FROM THE OLD MAN. [ SNIFFS ] THIS IS SILVER VINE SAKE. SILVER VINE SAKE! IT'S SHIRO'S SILVER VINE SAKE! LET ME HAVE IT! OH, LET ME HAVE MY PRESENT! [ LAUGHING ] WHAT'S UP WITH YOU? I JUST REALIZED THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY DAD WOULD EVER WANT TO KILL KURO. [ MEOWS ] [ SIGHS ] YOU KNOW, OUR OLD MAN WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY AWESOME. HUH? [ GASPS ] NOTHING. I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. YUMMY! [ MEOWS ] ♪♪ [ MAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] [ MEWLING ] HOW ABOUT A TOAST? TO KURO AND THE OLD MAN. YOU'D BETTER NOT, RIN. HUMANS SHOULDN'T BE DRINKING THAT STUFF. OH, COME ON, MAN. IT'S JUST FOR SHOW. YOU KNOW, TO MARK THE OCCASION. OKAY. BUT JUST FOR SHOW. ALL RIGHT, BOTTOMS UP. BOTTOMS UP. - IDIOT! - [ GROANS ] GROSS. [ SIGHS ] SHIRO'S SILVER VINE SAKE. YUM, YUM. [ RIN ] SUMMERTIME. THE OCEAN. [ SHIMA ] THE BIKINIS! LET'S HIT ON CHICKS! OH, MAN, I LOVE THE OCEAN!
