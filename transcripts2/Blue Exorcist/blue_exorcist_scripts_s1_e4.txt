 ALL THE PLANTS IN THE WORLD. AND IF YOU GO THERE, YOU CAN SEE EVERY SINGLE PLANT UNDER THE SUN. ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL? REALLY? OH, I WANNA GO THERE. LET'S GO TOGETHER, GRANDMA. OH, I'D LIKE TO, BUT I'M OLD NOW AND MY LEGS HURT. BESIDES, THIS GARDEN IS MY TREASURE, AND I COULD

 NEVER LEAVE IT BEHIND. THAT WOULDN'T DO. BUT WHEN YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP, SHIEMI, MAYBE YOU COULD GO LOOK FOR IT. MM-HMM. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn ♪♪ [ MAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] [ CRYING ] I DON'T BELIEVE IT. IT'S SO... SAD. - RIN. - HEY! GIVE IT BACK, DAMN IT! I DON'T WANT YOU SOAKING MY MANGA WITH YOUR WEIRD FLUIDS. YOU SHOULD BE STUDYING. HAVE YOU EVEN LOOKED... AT ANY OF THE MATERIALS I GAVE YOU YESTERDAY? I LOOKED AT 'EM. OH, I LOOKED AT 'EM, ALL RIGHT. BUT WHAT'S WITH THIS "FOR KIDS" CRAP? DO YOU THINK I'M SOME KIND OF MORON OR SOMETHING? NO, YOU'RE NOT A MORON. IDIOT, YES. MORON, NO. [ GROWLS ] MOLE-INFESTED, FOUR-EYED-- I SIMPLY THOUGHT THAT IF YOU STARTED WITH THOSE, THEY MIGHT BE A LITTLE EASIER FOR YOU TO HANDLE. THAT'S ANOTHER THING. DO YOU THINK I'M THE TYPE OF GUY... WHO CAN SIT AT A DESK AND FREAKING STUDY ALL DAY? NOT BY A LONG SHOT. NOT YOU. THE THING IS, DO YOU WANT TO BE AN EXORCIST? UH, WELL, YEAH. THEN HIT THE BOOKS AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR DAYS OFF. HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I GOT CALLED. ALSO, I HAVE TO GET SOME SUPPLIES. I WON'T BE GONE LONG. YOU GOT CALLED FOR AN EXORCISM? MM-HMM. I'M COMING WITH YOU. I CAN LEARN WAY MORE BY WATCHING YOU THAN BY READING ABOUT IT IN SOME OLD BOOK. BUT YOU'RE STILL JUST A PAGE, RIN. I'M SORRY, BUT THEY DON'T ALLOW TRAINEES OUT IN THE FIELD. [ GROANS ] DON'T GIVE ME THAT. WHAT THE HELL DO THEY KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING ANYWAY? I'M ALREADY FIELD TESTED. YOU HAVE A POINT. OKAY, BUT ONLY TO WATCH. KNEW YOU'D SEE IT MY WAY. DO WHAT I TELL YOU, AND DON'T ANYTHING-- ANYTHING-- WITHOUT CHECKING WITH ME FIRST. I GOT IT, YUKIO, LOUD AND CLEAR. THIS IS THE KEY TO THE SUPPLY SHOP. THAT ARE ISSUED ONLY TO QUALIFIED EXORCISTS. IT'S ONE OF THE MANY KEYS LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE BOATLOAD OF 'EM. [ GASPS ] WHOA. [ RIN ] WHOA! THIS IS WAY HIGH! WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING KEYS THAT ACT LIKE WARP ZONES? THE ACADEMY HAPPENS TO BE AN IMPORTANT BASE OF OPERATIONS... FOR THE KNIGHTS OF THE TRUE CROSS. THE DIRECTOR'S POWER PROTECTS IT FROM PRETTY MUCH ANY ATTACK BY MID-LEVEL DEMONS. HE DOES IT USING A SERIES OF TALISMANS, BARRIERS AND EVEN LABYRINTHS. REALLY? I GUESS HE'S NOT YOUR AVERAGE WHACKED-OUT CLOWN AFTER ALL. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE RIGHT KEY, YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE YOU WANT IN THE SCHOOL WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT IN ONE OF HIS TRAPS. THAT SOUNDS CONVENIENT. [ YUKIO ] KEYS ARE VERY IMPORTANT HERE. IF YOU GET ONE, MAKE SURE YOU DON'T LOSE IT. OKAY. YOU HAVE TO WAIT HERE WHILE I GO GET THE SUPPLIES. - I WANNA GO TOO. - NO. THE STORE'S FOR EXORCISTS AND HIGHER-UPS ONLY. - I WON'T BE LONG. - [ GROWLS ] - DON'T GO ANYWHERE, AND DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING. - YEAH, I GOT IT! [ GROWLS ] GEEZ, NOW THAT HE'S MR. BIG MAN ON CAMPUS, HE'S TREATING ME LIKE A LITTLE KID. "DON'T GO ANYWHERE, DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING." WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS, MY MOM? JERK. ONE OF THESE DAYS, HE'S GONNA BE THE ONE THAT'S COUNTING ON ME. HUH? [ BIRDS TWITTERING ] [ WATER TRICKLING ] NO WAY! IT'S AWESOME IN THERE. HUH? [ GASPS ] - [ GASPS ] - [ EXPLOSION ] [ CREAKING ] [ BOTH GASP ] UH, I DIDN'T DO IT. IT JUST HAPPENED. HUH? DEMON! HUH? - THAT GATE HAS A SPELL ON IT. - IT DOES? OH, CRAP. IT REACTED TO ME. [ WHIMPERS ] G-GO AWAY, YOU DEMON. [ GROWLS ] WATCH WHO YOU'RE CALLING A DEMON! DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. I'M NOT A DEMON, GOT IT? [ WHIMPERS, SCREAMS ] STAY AWAY! - UH, HEY. - DON'T COME NEAR ME! UM, IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR LEGS? HUH? [ YUKIO ] VALERIANA, HYPERICUM, FERN, HOREHOUND. TWO OF EACH, PLEASE. OF C-DENSITY HOLY WATER AND 300 GRAMS OF IRON SAND. UH, ONE LITER OH, AND SIX DOZEN OF THE USUAL HOLY SILVER BULLETS. STOCKPILING AGAIN? YOU ARE A GOOD CUSTOMER. I BURNED THROUGH MOST OF OUR SUPPLIES THE OTHER DAY. SO ANYWAY, ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER-- HOW IS SHIEMI DOING? NOT TOO GOOD. HER LEGS ARE GETTING WORSE EVERY DAY. EVERY SINGLE DOCTOR I'VE TAKEN HER TO CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG. THEY ALL SAY SHE'S FINE. THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU TO COME. WHAT DOES SHIEMI HAVE TO SAY? WELL, YOU MIGHT SAY WE HAD A BIT OF A FALLING OUT. WE'RE NOT SPEAKING MUCH THESE DAYS. HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HER THAT COULD BE DEMON RELATED? MM. MY MOTHER-- SHIEMI'S GRANDMOTHER-- PASSED AWAY LAST WINTER. WHOA. THAT'S RANK. MY EYES ARE STINGING. I MIX COW DUNG AND WATER TO MAKE THE FERTILIZER. I HAD YOU AROUND. COW DUNG, HUH? THANK GOODNESS I NEEDED THE HOLE DUG REALLY DEEP. THANK GOODNESS, MY ASS. FIRST YOU CALL ME A DEMON, AND THEN YOU START BOSSING ME AROUND? I DIDN'T MEAN IT. I WAS JUST SCARED. WELL, I'M SORRY. [ SIGHS ] - HUH? - CAN WE MAKE UP NOW? WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU, I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT A GOOD PERSON YOU WERE. [ STAMMERS ] WELL, ALL RIGHT. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO, I DON'T MIND. OH, I'M GLAD. OKAY, I CAN GO FIRST. - I'M SHIEMI MORIYAMA. - RIN. RIN OKUMURA. [ GASPS ] SHE MIXED COW POO WITH THAT HAND! THIS IS A SPECIAL PLACE FOR ME. IT'S MY GRANDMA'S GARDEN. AND SHE'D TEACH ME ALL KINDS OF THINGS. I'D HELP HER WITH THE PLANTING, I-- I LOVE THIS GARDEN, AND I LOVE MY GRANDMA. BUT LAST WINTER, WHILE WORKING IN THE GARDEN, SHE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND DIED. I THINK WHEN SHE DIED, SHE WENT TO THE GARDEN OF AMAHARA. I HOPE SO ANYWAY. GARDEN OF AMAHARA? GRANDMA SAID IT'S A PLACE GOD CREATED... WHERE HE GATHERED ALL THE PLANTS IN THE WHOLE WORLD. I KNOW IT'S JUST A FAIRY TALE, BUT IF THERE REALLY IS A GARDEN OF AMAHARA, A SPECIAL PLACE WHERE I CAN GO AND WANDER AROUND... LOOKING AT ALL THE PLANTS IN THE WORLD, THEN I'D LIKE TO GO THERE. [ YUKIO ] RIN! - OH. - HUH? I CAN'T LET YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT FOR A SECOND. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - HE-HEY, YUKIO. YUKI! "YUKI"? - YOU KNOW HER? - YES. SHIEMI'S MOTHER RUNS THE SHOP. I SEE HER EVERY TIME I COME HERE. HOW ARE YOU DOING, SHIEMI? HE-HELLO, YUKI. WE'RE TWINS. HE'S THE OLDER ONE. [ GASPS ] BUT YOU SEEM MORE LIKE HIS BIG BROTHER. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I AM MORE MATURE THAN HE IS. TECHNICALLY, THOUGH, HE IS THE OLDER ONE. TECHNICALLY? WHATEVER! SHIEMI, COME ON. LET HIM HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR LEGS. BUT, MOM, I TOLD YOU I HAVEN'T BEEN INFECTED. IT'S JUST A PRECAUTION. IF I DON'T FIND ANYTHING, YOU'RE NONE THE WORSE OFF, RIGHT? WILL YOU LET ME TAKE A LOOK? MM-HMM. IT'S OKAY. - A ROOT. - [ RIN ] HUH? IT'S A TEMPTAINT. A DEMON CAUSED THIS. - BUT THAT CAN'T BE. - SHE'S NOT POSSESSED, IS SHE? NO. SHE'S DEFINITELY NOT POSSESSED. THE DEMON THAT DID THIS ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO POSSESS A HUMAN. THIS LOOKS LIKE THE WORK OF A DOÖKKÁLFAR-- A GREEN MAN... OR AN ENT. THEY'RE LOW-LEVEL DEMONS THAT POSSESS GRASS AND TREES. THE SOIL INTO SHIEMI'S LEGS AND IS FEEDING OFF HER SOUL. ONE OF THEM REACHED THROUGH THE DEMON IS SOMEWHERE IN THIS GARDEN. [ WHIMPERS ] SHIEMI, USUALLY A DEMON CAN FIND ITS WAY... INTO A PERSON'S SOUL THROUGH CONVERSATION. YOU MUST HAVE SPOKEN WITH ONE. [ WHIMPERS ] CAN YOU REMEMBER DOING THAT? NO. I DIDN'T. I NEVER SPOKE WITH ANY DEMON. SHIEMI! WE HAVE TO GET YOU OUT OF THIS GARDEN NOW! I KNOW YOUR GRANDMOTHER LOVED IT, BUT THIS HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH, YOUNG LADY. I WON'T LET YOU RISK YOUR HEALTH OVER THIS CURSED PLACE. THIS GARDEN ISN'T CURSED. THIS PLACE WAS GRANDMA'S GREATEST TREASURE. I WON'T LEAVE IT, MOM! I HATE YOU! [ GASPS ] OH, SHIEMI! SHIEMI! [ GRANDMOTHER ] GOOD, SHIEMI. NOW HERE'S ANOTHER TIP. YOU PLANT ROOT VEGETABLES WHEN THE MOON WAXES, AND LEAFY PLANTS WHEN THE MOON WANES. - GOT IT. - YOU REALLY LOVE PLANTS AND FLOWERS, - DON'T YOU, SHIEMI? - MM-HMM. AND I LOVE YOU TOO. DON'T FORGET. I'LL STAY WITH YOU FOREVER. WITH YOU... FOREVER. EVEN THOUGH SHE LOOKS FINE ON THE OUTSIDE, THE DEMON IS DRAINING HER ENERGY THROUGH HER LEGS. IF IT ISN'T EXORCISED SOON, SHE WILL DIE. [ YUKIO ] WHY IS SHE SLEEPING OUT HERE IN THE STOREHOUSE? [ MOTHER ] OH, WELL, THIS IS WHERE HER GRANDMOTHER LIVED. AFTER HER GRANDMOTHER DIED, SHE DECIDED SHE WASN'T GOING TO LEAVE THE GARDEN AGAIN, AND THEN SHE MOVED IN. THAT'S ABOUT THE TIME SHE STARTED HAVING TROUBLE WITH HER LEGS. JUST LIKE HER GRANDMOTHER. HER LEGS BOTHERED HER TOO. THE MEMORIES OF HER GRANDMOTHER MUST WEIGH HEAVILY ON HER MIND. FORGIVE ME FOR PRYING, BUT IS THAT THE REASON... YOU AND SHIEMI HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING ALONG? YES, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT. I WASN'T REALLY CUT OUT FOR MOTHERHOOD. AND I WASN'T A GOOD DAUGHTER EITHER, I'M AFRAID. SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN A FRAIL CHILD, AND WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL, SHE'D GET SICK WHENEVER SHE WENT TO SCHOOL. BUT SINCE I WAS ALWAYS SO BUSY WITH THE SHOP, HER GRANDMOTHER WAS THE ONE WHO TOOK CARE OF HER. I COULDN'T HELP FEELING A LITTLE JEALOUS. SHE AND HER GRANDMOTHER WERE SO CLOSE, AND I FELT LEFT OUT. IN THE END, IT'S MY FAULT WE BECAME SO DISTANT FROM EACH OTHER. AND HERE I AM, ACTING ALL CONCERNED, LIKE THE KIND OF MOTHER I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALL ALONG. YOU'RE NOT HELPING HER BY THINKING THAT WAY. IN FACT, YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE DEMON'S HANDS. THEY EXPLOIT THE WEAKNESSES OF A PERSON'S SOUL. [ GIGGLES ] [ GRANDMOTHER ] SHIEMI! SHIEMI, GIVE ME A HAND, WILL YOU? THE FROST IS COMING, AND WE HAVE TO COVER... THE GRAPE ARBOR BEFORE IT GETS HERE. BUT, GRANDMA, I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR THE GARDEN OF AMAHARA. REALLY? I SAVED A BUNCH OF MONEY FOR THE TRIP, YOU SEE? I MIGHT EVEN HAVE ENOUGH TO TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD. YOU'RE LEAVING THE GARDEN? [ GIGGLES ] GO HAVE FUN THEN. BUT I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE ENOUGH IN THAT PURSE TO MAKE IT ALL THE WAY AROUND THE WORLD. OH. I DON'T? YOU COULD LOOK FOR IT NEARBY. BUT MAYBE TODAY OKAY. I'LL COVER THE GRAPE ARBOR AS SOON AS I GET BACK, GRANDMA. OH, DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT. BE CAREFUL NOW. AND MAKE SURE YOU COME HOME BEFORE IT GETS DARK, OKAY? [ SNIFFLING ] GRANDMA? THE PANSIES HAVEN'T SPROUTED YET. AND HOW AM I GONNA FIX THE GRAPE ARBOR? IF I DON'T DO SOMETHING, YOUR GARDEN WILL DIE. [ WEEPING ] WHAT SHOULD I DO? [ FEMALE VOICE ] YOU SHOULD PROTECT THE GARDEN. WHO'S THAT? I CAN HELP YOU PROTECT IT... IF YOU WANT. [ GASPS ] WAS THAT YOU TALKING A SECOND AGO? YES. I'M A FAIRY. I LIVE HERE. WILL YOU HELP ME PROTECT THIS GARDEN? I WILL! I'LL HELP YOU. I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN. JUST PLEASE KEEP GRANDMA'S GARDEN SAFE. SHE LOVED IT SO MUCH. THEN LET'S PROTECT THIS GARDEN TOGETHER. FOREVER. PROMISE ME. I HAVEN'T DONE THE WATERING THIS EVENING. I HAVE TO GO. I HAVE TO PROTECT IT. [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] [ RIN ] HEY, DOING SOME LATE-NIGHT GARDENING? YOU KNOW, YOUR MOM'S REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU. I DON'T CARE. WHAT DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING? THIS IS WHAT I WANT. I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS! I'LL PROTECT GRANDMA'S GARDEN! HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? STOP IT! NO, STOP! [ SHATTERING ] PLEASE, JUST STOP. WOULD YOU SNAP OUT OF IT ALREADY? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO YOURSELF? IF I-- IF ONLY I'D COME HOME EARLIER THAT DAY THEN-- I'M BACK, GRANDMA. SORRY I'M SO LATE. [ GASPS ] GRANDMA? GRANDMA! IF I'D STAYED AND HELPED HER WITH THE ARBOR, GRANDMA WOULDN'T HAVE DIED. IT WAS MY FAULT. SHE DIED BECAUSE OF ME. THAT'S WHY-- THAT'S WHY NO MATTER WHAT, I HAVE TO PROTECT HER GARDEN. NO WAY. SHE'S JUST LIKE ME. TRAPPED IN THE PAST, BLAMING HERSELF. [ SOBS ] THEN STOP MAKING YOUR MOM WORRY ABOUT YOU. IT'S NOT RIGHT. WHAT YOU'RE DOING ISN'T WORTH IT. COME ON, WHAT HAPPENED TO GETTING OUT IN THE WORLD... AND FINDING THE GARDEN OF AMAHARA? - YOU FORGET ABOUT THAT? - [ GASPS ] WHAT WOULD YOUR GRANDMA SAY? WOULD SHE TELL YOU NOT TO GO? IS THAT WHAT SHE'D SAY? GO HAVE FUN THEN. [ CRYING ] UH-UH. SHE WOULDN'T. SHE WOULDN'T SAY THAT. [ CRYING CONTINUES ] I'M SUCH AN IDIOT. I CAN'T MOVE MY LEGS ANYMORE. I GOT THIS. I'M GONNA CHOP THE HELL OUT OF THAT DAMN ROOT. SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU. IT WAS JUST GETTING GOOD. HUH? [ SHOUTS ] WHEN'D YOU GET HERE? THIS DEMON IS A LIGHTWEIGHT. I CAN EXORCISE IT IN NO TIME. DON'T WORRY, SHIEMI. YOUR LEGS ARE GOING TO WORK AGAIN. IT'S UP TO YOU THOUGH. YOU HAVE TO WANT THIS. I DO. [ DEMON ] I WON'T ALLOW IT. YOU'RE BREAKING YOUR PROMISE. IT'S REVEALED ITSELF. I WON'T LET YOU. [ SHIEMI SCREAMS ] SHIEMI! [ GRUNTS ] [ LAUGHS ] WE'RE GOING TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER. YOU'LL LIVE IN THIS GARDEN TILL THE DAY YOU DIE. DAMN IT, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE BLOOMING THIS LATE AT NIGHT. [ YUKIO ] OH, NO, IT'S USING HER AS A SHIELD. HEY, RIN. YEAH? I THINK I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP WITH THIS THING. HUH? YOU UP FOR IT? SORRY, COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN? I SAID I NEED YOUR HELP! [ LAUGHS ] WELL, SINCE YOU'RE MY LITTLE BROTHER AND ALL, YOU DON'T NEED TO TWIST MY ARM. I'D LOVE TO GIVE YOU A HAND. [ SNARLS ] [ GASPS ] YOU'RE A DEMON LIKE ME. YOU GOT THE WRONG IDEA, STINKY. I'M NOTHING LIKE YOU! WHAT'S WRONG? YOU LOSE YOUR CONFIDENCE? QUIT PLAYING DIRTY, YOU. WHEN IT COMES TO DEMONS, THERE'S NO PLAYING CLEAN. STRIKE ME WITH YOUR SWORD, I DARE YOU. I HOPE YOU WON'T REGRET ALL THE BIG RED GASHES... YOU'RE GOING TO PUT ON OUR PRETTY BODIES. GET BACK, RIN. AT THIS POINT, I HAVE TO SHOOT THEM BOTH. ARE YOU CRAZY? HA! YOU'RE BLUFFING. YOU WOULDN'T SACRIFICE THE GIRL. YOU CAN'T FOOL ME. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? [ GASPS ] YOU COULD BE RIGHT... OR YOU COULD BE DEAD WRONG. YUKIO. I WONDER WHICH ONE IT'S GOING TO BE. DAMN YOU, EXORCIST! YOU WOULDN'T DARE SHOOT US. NO! NOW'S YOUR CHANCE, RIN! - [ RIN SHOUTING ] - NO! SON OF A-- - YUKI. - [ RIN ] HUH? YOU'RE OKAY. THE ROOT ON YOUR LEGS IS GONE. TRY STANDING. HUH? YOU'RE OKAY. [ GASPS ] [ MOTHER ] SHIEMI! HI, MOM. GET OVER THERE. [ BOTH GASP ] RIN-- MAN, JUST TELL HER YOU'RE SORRY. IF YOU DON'T TELL HER NOW, YOU'RE DEFINITELY GONNA REGRET IT. YOU KNOW, THERE ONCE WAS A TIME... UM-- WHEN EVEN I TRIED TO FIND THAT PLACE-- THE GARDEN OF AMAHARA. [ GASPS ] YOU SILLY GIRL, MAKING ME WORRY SO MUCH. OH, MOM, I'M SORRY. [ BOTH CRYING ] IT'S COOL WHEN THINGS WORK OUT LIKE THIS. HEY, WHAT KIND OF BULLET DID YOU SHOOT HER WITH ANYWAY? PLANT VITAMINS. IT STINGS FOR A LITTLE BIT, BUT THAT'S ALL. AH, ARE YOU KIDDING? THAT'S IT? WE SAVED HER, BUT SOMEHOW IT FEELS LIKE I WAS THE ONE WHO GOT SAVED. ♪♪ [ MAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] OH. SO THIS IS YOUR NEW CLASSMATE, SHIEMI MORIYAMA. I-IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU ALL. UH, WHAT THE-- I DECIDED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE WORLD... AND I WANT TO BE STRONGER. SO I ASKED YUKI-- I MEAN, MR. OKUMURA-- TO GET ME IN. YOU'RE SUPER TENSE. ARE YOU OKAY? I'M SURPRISED YOU EVEN MADE IT HERE. YOU'RE THE REASON FOR THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH, RIN. HUH? UH, NAH, IT'S COOL. ALSO I WANTED TO SEE WHAT YUKI WAS LIKE AS A TEACHER. UH, YEAH, I SHOULD'VE KNOWN. [ SIGHING ] HMM. IT'S 'CAUSE YOU KEEP FLIRTING WITH THAT GIRL, JACKASS. [ RIN ] I'M THE ONE WHO'S GONNA DEFEAT SATAN, SO STAY OUTTA MY WAY!
