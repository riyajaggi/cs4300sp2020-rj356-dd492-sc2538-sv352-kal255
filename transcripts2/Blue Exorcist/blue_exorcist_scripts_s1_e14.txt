IF YOU EVER GET THE URGE TO HEAR MY VOICE AGAIN, YOU CAN CALL ME DAY OR NIGHT. YOU'RE SUCH A MORON! [ GIGGLES ] YOU'RE FUNNY. I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT SUMMER VACATION. [ YUKIO ] [ BELL DINGING ] WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO HOLD THAT THOUGHT, BECAUSE FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS, YOU LUCKY EXWIRES... WILL PARTICIPATE IN A FIELD DRILL AT THE ACADEMY'S TRAINING CAMP IN THE FOREST. OF COURSE, I'LL BE COMING ALONG... AND SO WILL MISS KIRIGAKURE. MEOW-HOO. NOW THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL... IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE READY TO GO OUT ON MISSIONS, SO STAY SHARP. [ ALL AGREEING ] ♪♪ [ MEN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] [ BELL DINGING ] [ CICADAS BUZZING ] YEAH! THIS IS GONNA BE RAD! LIKE GOING ON A PICNIC! I CAN SEE US NOW HANGING OUT AROUND THE CAMPFIRE AT NIGHT AND LEARNING FOLK DANCES. [ CHUCKLES, SIGHS ] [ SCREAMING ] NO, NO, NO! HEY, GET OFF ME! IS HE GONNA BE OKAY? UH, SHIMA'S ALWAYS HAD A HARD TIME AROUND BUGS. [ BUZZING ] [ SHIMA ] UH, IT'S SO HOT. [ MIWA ] MY PACK'S HEAVY. [ YUKIO ] DURING THE DAY, THE FOREST IS PEACEFUL. BUT AT NIGHT IT BECOMES A HOTBED OF LOWER-LEVEL DEMON ACTIVITY. WE HAVE TO SET UP BASE CAMP BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN. [ YUKIO ] PICK UP THE PACE. LOOK AT THAT GUY. ISN'T HE HOT IN THAT COAT? [ SHURA ] YOU HEARD HIM. GET A MOVE ON. HUH? UM, MA'AM, WHERE'S YOUR BACKPACK? IT'S OVER THERE. HUH? IT'S SO COLD. IS IT SAFE TO DRINK? [ RIN LAUGHING ] I GET THE FEELING OKUMURA'S ENERGY IS SUPERNATURAL. [ ALL PANTING ] [ YUKIO ] THIS WILL BE OUR BASE CAMP. THE BOYS AND I ARE GOING TO START SETTING UP THE TENTS AND BUILDING A FIRE. WHILE THAT'S HAPPENING, MISS KIRIGAKURE AND THE GIRLS... ARE GOING TO DRAW A MAGIC CIRCLE AROUND THE PERIMETER AND GET DINNER STARTED. RIGHT. LET'S GET MOVING. HE FINALLY TOOK HIS COAT OFF. UH-OH. SOMEONE'S COME TO PARTY. [ CICADAS BUZZING ] THIS IS STARTING TO FEEL MORE AND MORE LIKE A PICNIC. THIS IS CAMPING, NOT A PICNIC. AND WOULD YOU STOP HITTING THE TENT LIKE THAT OR IT'S GONNA-- [ BOTH GASPING ] SEE? WHAT'D I TELL YOU? [ LAUGHS ] THEY'RE HAVING FUN. YOU THINK SO? THEY LOOK SUPER ANNOYING TO ME. [ SHIEMI ] BOYS ARE KINDA MYSTERIOUS, DON'T YOU THINK? IF YOU ASK ME, YOU'RE THE MYSTERIOUS ONE. HUH? LISTEN, I REALLY DON'T LIKE YOU. UH, UM, PLEASE SHOW ME HOW TO WEAR THIS UNIFORM THE RIGHT WAY. WHAT'S UP WITH HER? SHE STILL TALKS TO ME EVEN AFTER I SAID I DIDN'T LIKE HER. WHAT'D YOU SAY? HMPH. NOTHING, ALL RIGHT? HURRY UP AND FINISH YOUR SIDE OF THE CIRCLE. YEAH, SURE. HONESTLY, I'M SURROUNDED BY FREAKS. - YOU DONE DRAWING YET? - [ THINKING ] LIKE I SAID. WE'RE ALMOST FINISHED. [ CRACKLING ] [ BLOWING ] [ KAMIKI ] OW! HUH? [ RIN ] I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. GIVE ME THAT! [ ALL GASPING ] [ ALL ] THANKS FOR THE MEAL! WHOA! MAN, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE! IF YOU EVER WANTED TO SWITCH SIDES, YOU'D MAKE SOMEONE AN AWESOME WIFE. YOU ARE REALLY AN AMAZING COOK, OKUMURA. SO YUMMY, RIN. OH, THANKS, GUYS. [ LAUGHS ] COOKING IS THE ONLY VALUABLE SKILL MY POOR BROTHER HAS. SHUT IT, YOU FOUR-EYED MOLE FACE. [ MIWA ] IT'S SO GOOD, I COULD EAT PLATE AFTER PLATE. [ SHIMA ] YOU EAT WAY MORE THAN I THOUGHT, MORIYAMA. [ THINKING ] THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE FELT LIKE THIS. [ FUJIMOTO ] INSTEAD OF USING YOUR POWER TO HURT OTHERS, YOU SHOULD BE USING IT TO HELP THEM. [ NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE ] WHERE ARE YOU GOING, RIN? RIN! [ BIRD SINGING ] [ THINKING ] OH, RIGHT. I KNOW WHY. I WAS ALWAYS DITCHING SCHOOL, SO I NEVER REALLY GOT TO DO STUFF LIKE THIS BEFORE. WE GOT SOME DRINKS HERE. WHAT DO YOU WANT? HEY, OKUMURA. I GUESS THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE FRIENDS. [ THINKING ] IT'S COOL. I'LL PICK ONE OUT MYSELF. [ GIGGLES ] WHAT'S SO FUNNY? WELL, I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT RIN, ESPECIALLY SINCE HE'S BEEN ACTING SO STRANGE LATELY. BUT HE'S HAVING FUN NOW. THAT'S GOOD. YOU REALLY DO CARE ABOUT HIM, DON'T YOU? - HMM? - [ CHUCKLES ] OH, NOTHING. NEVER MIND. OKAY, LISTEN UP. I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THE DRILL. [ DRUNKENLY ] YEAH. IT'S A TEST OF COURAGE. I DARE YA. YOU SHOULDN'T BE DRINKING ON THE JOB. OKAY, HOLD ON A SEC. DIDN'T SHE SAY SHE WAS 18? THAT MAKES HER A MINOR. WAIT, 18? DON'T BE RIDICULOUS. THIS YEAR SHE'LL BE TURNING TWENTY-S-- UH-OH. MY HAND SLIPPED. CUT THE SHIT AND GET TO WORK ALREADY. LOOK! I MADE HIM MAD. [ LAUGHS ] [ CLEARS THROAT ] RIGHT. HERE'S THE RUNDOWN. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU SPREAD OUT TO FIND AND LIGHT SOME LANTERNS... THAT ARE HIDDEN SOMEWHERE IN THE FOREST. THE LANTERNS ARE LOCATED WITHIN A 500-METER RADIUS OF CAMP. WHOEVER CAN KEEP THEIR LANTERN LIT AND RETURN IT TO BASE CAMP IN THE NEXT THREE DAYS... WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO GO ON ACTUAL COMBAT MISSIONS. [ ALL ] HMM? HOWEVER, THERE ARE ONLY THREE LANTERNS OUT THERE. THEREFORE THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLOTS OPEN TO GO ON MISSIONS. BUT THAT MEANS-- LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF YOUR SHOULDER BAGS. YOU'LL FIND THREE DAYS' WORTH OF FOOD, WATER AND OTHER NECESSITIES. FLASHLIGHT, ONE DEMON-REPELLING BOTTLE ROCKET AND ONE MATCH. YOU'LL ALSO FIND A COMPASS, BY RELYING ON YOUR STRENGTHS AND USING YOUR ABILITIES TO THEIR FULLEST, YOU'LL FIND THE PATH TO SUCCESS. SO ALL WE DO IS FIND A LANTERN, LIGHT IT AND BRING IT BACK. THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A DRILL? [ SHURA LAUGHING ] I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION. THIS ISN'T GONNA BE ANYTHING LIKE THE EXWIRE EXAM. COULD YOU NOT-- YOU'LL BLOW YOUR COVER IN THAT BIG, DARK FOREST. SO YOU BETTER NOT BE FLAMING UP OUT THERE, KID. [ GASPS ] [ SHURA ] I'M AN INSPECTOR AND I'M ON DUTY. DON'T FORGET THAT. IF ANYONE FINDS OUT YOU GOT SATANIC POWERS, THAT'S IT FOR YOU. I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO TELL THE BRASS EVERYTHING I KNOW. ONCE I DO, THE ARCHKNIGHT AND THE PALADIN ARE GONNA COME KILL YA, AND THOSE GUYS ARE WAY SCARIER THAN ANY DEMON. SO THINK REAL HARD BEFORE YOU GO POPPING OFF, OKAY? YOU WERE ALL EXCITED A MINUTE AGO. HUH? WHAT HAPPENED? COME ON, YOU'RE NOT CHICKENING OUT, ARE YA? HUH? BON. I WAS THINKING. THIS DRILL IS ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO MAKE US COMPETE. BUT THEN IF WE START DOING THAT-- WE ARE GONNA BE AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS. [ CRACKLING ] [ SUGURO ] THEY'RE NOT GIVING US A CHOICE. LOOKS LIKE IT'S EVERY PERSON FOR THEMSELVES. WE CAN'T HELP EACH OTHER. [ KAMIKI ] HE'S RIGHT. THERE'S ALL OF US AND ONLY THREE SLOTS. I KINDA LIKE THOSE ODDS. [ SHIMA ] THEN IT'S SETTLED, GUYS. NO HARD FEELINGS, OKAY? [ THINKING ] I CAN'T USE MY POWER. [ YUKIO ] TAKE YOUR POSITIONS. READY? [ GUNSHOT ] [ PANTING ] [ GASPS ] WHOA! WHERE DID ALL THE MOTHS COME FROM? [ YUKIO ] AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, AT NIGHT THE FOREST IS OVERRUN WITH LOWER-LEVEL DEMONS. WITH YOUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITIES, YOU HAVE A SLIM CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING THIS MISSION. [ THINKING ] BLOOD-SUCKING MOTHS. THEY MUST BE SOME KIND OF CHUCHI. IF YOU THINK YOU'RE IN DANGER, LIGHT THE DEMON-REPELLING ROCKET. MISS KIRIGAKURE OR I WILL COME FIND YOU AND GET YOU OUT. UM, IS THERE A REASON WHY WE'RE ONLY GETTING ONE MATCH? IF YOU USE IT TO LIGHT THE ROCKET, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO LIGHT THE LANTERN, SO YOU SHOULD THINK VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING IT. [ KAMIKI SCREAMING ] I HUMBLY APPEAL TO THEE, OH, GODDESS INARI. GRANT MY REQUEST. LEAVE NOT MY PRAYERS TO THEE UNFULFILLED. - [ GROWLING ] - WHEN DAVID SERVED GOD'S PURPOSE IN HIS OWN GENERATION, HE FELL ASLEEP AND WAS BURIED WITH HIS ANCESTORS... AND HIS BODY DECAYED. [ EXPLOSION ] YOUR HOLY ONE SEE DECAY. [ EXPLOSION ] YOU WILL NOT LET HEY, NEE, I NEED SOME BUG-REPELLENT ROUX. - NEE! - [ GASPS ] NEE? NEE, NEE, NEE! [ GASPS ] NEE! [ GASPS ] [ SHIEMI SCREAMING ] [ GASPS ] THAT'S SHIEMI. SHIEMI, WHERE ARE YOU? [ GASPS ] [ PANTING ] SHIEMI! GET OUTTA HERE! SHIEMI. SHIEMI. [ GASPS ] [ EXPLOSION ] [ RIN ] GET LOST! UH-- OH, CRAP. CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN. [ WINGS FLUTTERING ] [ PANTING ] I'M SO STUPID! I DID IT AGAIN. USING MY FLAMES IS BECOMING A HABIT. I HAVEN'T CHANGED AT ALL. - [ RUSTLING ] - [ GASPS ] OKUMURA, WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? [ GASPS ] YOU GONNA ANSWER ME OR WHAT? [ THINKING ] DID HE SEE IT? WHAT HAPPENED TO MORIYAMA? SHE OKAY? Y-Y-YEAH. I THINK SO. SHE'S UNCONSCIOUS THOUGH. HEY, TURN OFF THAT LIGHT ALREADY. HELLO? THE MOTHS ARE ATTRACTED TO IT. OH. RIGHT. SORRY. I GUESS HE DIDN'T SEE IT. YEAH, SO, ANYWAY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT BLUE LIGHT WAS JUST NOW? IT HAPPENED SO FAST AND WAS SO BRIGHT, [ GASPS ] I COULDN'T TELL WHAT IT WAS. I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK EITHER. MAYBE IT WAS ONE OF THOSE, UM-- WHAT DO YOU CALL THOSE THINGS? [ LAUGHS ] I GUESS HE DIDN'T SEE ME BURST INTO FLAMES AFTER ALL. THANK GOD. SO, UH, WHAT YOU DOING OVER HERE? WHAT AM I-- I CAME TO HELP HER, DORK. YEAH, BUT YOU SAID WE COULDN'T HELP EACH OTHER. SHUT UP! AFTER HEARING THAT SCREAM, WHO WOULDN'T COME RUNNING? [ LAUGHS ] EASY. SHIEMI'S GONNA BE FINE, OKAY? EVERYTHING'S COOL. I CAN TAKE CARE OF HER FROM HERE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN COOL? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH HER? WHAT DO YOU THINK? I'M GONNA TAKE HER BACK TO CAMP... AND THEN I'LL COME BACK. [ HUFFS ] COCKY LITTLE-- RIN? SHIEMI. OH, NEE! N-NEE. HEY, CALM DOWN. DON'T WORRY. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR MAGIC CIRCLE PAPERS, YOU CAN SUMMON HIM OVER AND OVER. THAT'S RIGHT! THEY SHOULD BE RIGHT HERE IN MY BAG. THAT'S WEIRD. I WONDER IF THEY FELL OUT WHEN I GOT ATTACKED. WAS THAT REAL? DID A GIANT MOTH ATTACK ME? [ FLUTTERING ] [ RUSTLING ] GET DOWN! - [ GRUNTING ] - SHIMA! HEY, BON. WHAT'S EVERYONE DOING OVER HERE? HANGING OUT? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? AND TURN THAT OFF. OH. [ CLICKS ] WELL, THIS HORDE OF MOTHS COVERED ME UP, AND AFTER THAT I SORT OF DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING. YEAH, TYPICAL SHIMA. [ CELL PHONES RINGING ] - MINE'S RINGING TOO. - [ BEEPS ] HMM. IT'S KONEKOMARU. HE SAYS HE FOUND A LANTERN. [ BOTH GASP ] "I CAN'T DO THIS ALONE." HE'S ASKING FOR HELP. [ BOTH LAUGHING ] WHAT DID I TELL YOU? AND HE GOES AND USES HIS POWER. NOT EVEN 10 MINUTES IN, HELL, WHATEVER. IT'S SO DARK OUT THERE, I BET IT BLINDED ANYONE WHO SAW IT. I'M STARTING TO SEE HOW FUTILE IT IS TO KEEP HIS POWERS SECRET. [ GUFFAWS ] YOU SOUND LIKE AN OLD MAN. ALL RIGHT, SHURA, LET'S HAVE IT. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? WHY ARE YOU WASTING TIME HERE WHEN YOU COULD JUST GO TELL THE VATICAN? [ GULPING ] AH-HA! I PUT MY REPORT ON HOLD 'CAUSE I DECIDED TO TEACH HIM HOW TO USE HIS SWORD. WHA-- YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT? SERIOUSLY? UH-HUH. HE HAD THE BALLS TO TELL ME HE WAS GONNA BE THE PALADIN. [ LAUGHS ] [ GROANS ] HMM. I GUESS I'M A SUCKER FOR A GUY WITH BIG AMBITIONS. YEAH, BUT WHEN SHIRO ASKED ME, I WAS ALL, "NO WAY. ARE YOU CRAZY?" - Y-Y-YOU MEAN DAD-- - I HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT AS FAR AS TRAINING RIN GOES, YOUR DAD WAS RIGHT TO COME TO ME ABOUT IT. THAT WOMAN DEFINITELY KNOWS WE'RE HERE... WATCHING. SHE'S SUCH A BRAT. AMAIMON, HAVE YOU SAID YOUR HELLOS TO THE MASTER OF THE FOREST YET? YES. MANY OF HIS BRETHREN HAVE BEEN KILLED, SO HE'S BEEN QUITE COOPERATIVE. I THINK I SHOULD STICK AROUND AND WATCH THE PROCEEDINGS THIS TIME. THAT HORRID WOMAN HAS HIDDEN THE KURIKARA SWORD. I WONDER IF THERE'S SOMETHING I CAN DO TO MAKE THE BOY SNAP. HEY, WHILE IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU MOTIVATED, I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU DO AS I SAY THIS TIME. HE HASN'T HEARD A WORD I'VE SAID. [ ALL GASPING ] WHOA. UH, YEAH. THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD LUG THIS BACK ALL BY YOURSELF. THIS THING'S A LANTERN? IT'S HUGE. IS THAT A STONE LANTERN? [ SUGURO ] IT'S A PEG LANTERN. [ BOTH GASP ] IT WAITS IN THE NIGHT FOR SOMEONE TO COME LIGHT IT. ONCE IT'S LIT, IT STARTS MOVING AROUND. IT EATS LIVING THINGS FOR FUEL. IT ESPECIALLY LIKES GIRLS. [ GASPS ] IT'S A DEMON THAT'LL ONLY STOP WHEN IT RUNS OUT OF FUEL OR WHEN THE SUN COMES UP. ONCE I SAW IT, I REALIZED WE MUST HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD THE REAL PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL. YEAH. FOR THIS DRILL, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HELP EACH OTHER AFTER ALL. [ SHIMA ] WAIT A SECOND, BON. THAT WE CAN'T HELP EACH OTHER OUT. YOU SPECIFICALLY SAID I-- LOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANT... WHEN HE SAID THERE WERE ONLY THREE SLOTS AVAILABLE. [ MIWA ] HE'S GOT A POINT. MR. OKUMURA NEVER ACTUALLY SAID THREE PEOPLE. WHATEVER. WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER. DOES ANYBODY KNOW KAMIKI AND TAKARA'S PHONE NUMBERS? [ ALL ] HMM-MM. ALL THE TIME, BUT SHE KEEPS TURNING ME DOWN. I TRY TO GET IZUMO'S - [ SUGURO GROANS ] - UM, I, UH, SORT OF CAME UP WITH A FORMATION... WHERE THE FIVE OF US CAN CARRY IT OUT. OKAY, THIS IS HOW WE'RE GONNA SEAL IT... TO KEEP IT FROM MOVING AROUND ONCE IT'S LIT. THEN BON WILL RECITE THE CORRESPONDING SCRIPTURE... SINCE HE'S ALREADY GOT IT MEMORIZED. [ FLUTTERING ] BEFORE WE LIGHT THE PEG LANTERN, WE'LL NEED TO GATHER UP LOTS OF CHUCHI TO FEED IT. AND WE'LL NEED A CONSTANT SUPPLY TO KEEP THE LIGHT FROM GOING OUT. THAT'S MORIYAMA'S JOB. WHOA! INCOMING! [ FLUTTERING ] [ MIWA ] ONCE THE CHUCHI SHOW UP, SHIMA AND I WILL BE THE ONES GUARDING MORIYAMA FROM THEIR ATTACKS. FINALLY, THE PERSON WITH THE MOST HORSEPOWER WILL BE THE ONE WHO PULLS THE CART. [ SHIEMI ] WOW, RIN, YOU'RE STRONG. [ SHIMA ] OKUMURA, WHAT PLANET DO YOU COME FROM? YOU GUYS, LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO. [ WHISTLING ] WHAT'S THAT? SOMEONE GAVE UP ALREADY? WELL, THAT WAS FAST. YOU HANDLE THIS ONE. [ GROANS ] ALL RIGHT, FINE. BUT DON'T FALL ASLEEP. I MEAN IT. [ GRUNTING ] WHO'S THAT? IT'S EITHER KAMIKI OR TAKARA. [ GASPS, GRUNTS ] [ SUGURO CHANTING ] WHAT HAPPENED? WHY DID WE STOP? [ RIN ] WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT THIS? - [ CHANTING CONTINUES ] - [ BOTH GROAN ] [ SHIMA SHOUTS ] OH, HOLY HELL, LOOK DOWN! THERE'S TONS OF 'EM! OH, MY GOD. I THINK I'M GONNA PISS MYSELF. MAYBE YOU'D FEEL BETTER IF YOU DID. YOU NEVER KNOW. [ MIWA ] OKUMURA, PLEASE DON'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT TO HIM. ONCE SOMEONE PEES THEIR PANTS, THAT'S IT. GAME OVER. [ CHANTING CONTINUES ] BON? [ SHOUTS ] WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? "KAHN." THAT'S SANSKRIT. LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE IS BEING SEALED HERE. HEY, GUYS! BE CAREFUL! [ CONTINUES CHANTING ] ALL RIGHT, HOW? OH, OKAY. WHERE THIS IS GOING. HUH? I THINK I SEE - [ CHANTING CONTINUES ] - OH. [ RIN ] KONEKOMARU AND I ARE GONNA TAKE THE CART TO THE OTHER SIDE. THE BUG SWAMP'S SHALLOW, SO... I'M GONNA WALK THROUGH IT? [ MIWA ] ONCE WE'RE THERE, I'M GONNA STAND BY WITH A TALISMAN. MEANWHILE, OVER ON THIS SIDE, SHIMA WILL WAIT WITH MORIYAMA ON HIS SHOULDERS. [ SHIMA ] THEN BON'S GONNA REMOVE THE TALISMAN AND UNSEAL THE PEG LANTERN... AND THEN I'LL CARRY MORIYAMA ON MY SHOULDERS... THROUGH THE BUG SWAMP TO THE OTHER SIDE? [ MIWA ] AFTER THAT, THE PEG LANTERN IS GOING TO GO AFTER ITS FAVORITE FOOD, MORIYAMA, I'M GONNA SEAL IT AGAIN BY APPLYING THE TALISMAN. AND THAT'S WHEN [ CHANTING ] SUGURO, MAN, YOUR DRAWINGS ARE EPIC! [ SHIMA LAUGHING ] YOU GUYS WANT ME TO GO WADING THROUGH THAT BUG SWAMP... WHILE MY HEAD'S GETTING SQUEEZED BETWEEN MORIYAMA'S THIGHS? I'LL DIE BEFORE WE MAKE IT. [ MIWA ] SHIMA, THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO ENTERTAIN YOUR LIBIDO. COME ON, KONEKO, DON'T BE MEAN. [ RIN ] FINE. WHATEVER. I'LL CARRY HER OVER. UH, HANG ON, 'CAUSE WE'RE DOING THIS. UH, OKAY. [ SHRIEKS ] [ BOTH SHOUTING ] [ SHIEMI ] IT'S SO HIGH! HEY, EASY ON THE HAIR. OH, SORRY. [ BLUBBERING ] THEY'RE POPPING. WE'RE GOOD TO GO OVER HERE. [ CHANTING CONTINUES ] WE'RE SET HERE TOO. ALL RIGHT, GIDDYAP. [ GROWLING ] [ LANTERN ROARS ] [ GROWLING ] HERE IT COMES. [ GRUNTS ] - [ GROWLING ] - OVER HERE! YOU DON'T HAVE TO TEASE IT. [ ROARS ] [ SHOUTING ] [ GRUNTS ] KAHN! [ CHANTING ] WE DID IT! - RIN, WE DID IT! - [ PANTING ] [ LAUGHS ] HEY, OKUMURA, GRAB ON. I'LL PULL YOU UP. IT'S COOL. I'M GOOD. [ MIWA CHANTING ] [ SIGHS ] WELL, NOW THAT THAT'S OVER WITH-- [ CREAKING ] UH-- OH. [ GROANING ] - [ GASPS ] - RIN! BEHIND YOU! HUH? [ SHOUTING ] ♪♪ [ WOMAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] [ AMAIMON LAUGHING ] [ YUKIO ] RIN, IT'S A TRAP! DON'T FALL FOR IT! [ RIN ] I-I GUESS I JUST DON'T GOT IT IN ME TO KEEP LYING TO EVERYONE, SO I DECIDED.
