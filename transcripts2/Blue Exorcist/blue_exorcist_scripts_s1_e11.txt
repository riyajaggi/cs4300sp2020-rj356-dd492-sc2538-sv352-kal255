I DON'T MIND DOING STUFF LIKE THIS. THE THING IS-- [ SHIMA ] THE THING IS WE'RE LACKING CUSTOMERS. MAN, I DON'T GET WHAT WE'RE DOING WRONG. THE SQUID LOOKS DAMN GOOD. [ KURO ] THEY SURE SMELL TASTY. RIN, CAN I HAVE ONE, PLEASE? THEY'RE FOR SALE. SORRY, PAL. HEY, IS THAT HIM? THAT'S YOUR NEW FAMILIAR, THE CAT SI, ISN'T IT? YEAH. I FIGURED I'D BRING HIM 'CAUSE THEY SAID IT WAS A MISSION. HA.

I HELPED YOU GRILL THOSE SQUIDS, DIDN'T I? WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? BESIDES, I'M NOT REALLY THE KIND OF GIRL WHO WORKS RETAIL. I-I GUESS YOU HAVE A POINT. HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

I'M TRULY BLESSED TO HAVE SUCH WONDERFUL STUDENTS UNDER MY WING. BY THE WAY, HOW'S BUSINESS? [ GROANS ] [ SEAGULL SQUAWKS ] [ THINKING ] I'M NOT A TEAM PLAYER, HUH? WHATEVER. THIS FEELS GREAT. I HAVEN'T FELT THIS WAY IN AGES. [ SIGHS ] I'VE HAD SO MUCH TO DEAL WITH. [ GASPS ] OH, NO! LEG CRAMP! [ GROANING ] HUH? ARE YOU OKAY? WHAT'S WRONG? - [ GASPS ] - [ SHOUTING ] HEY, QUIT HITTING ME! [ GROANS ] - [ GASPS ] - [ GROANS ] WHAT THE HELL? ALL I WAS GONNA DO WAS GIVE YOU MOUTH-TO-MOUTH RESUSCITATION. YOU GRABBED MY BOOBS, YOU BEAT ME. DON'T GIVE ME THAT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I JUST SAVED YOUR LIFE. NOW YOU WANNA KISS ME? QUIT BEING A HARDHEADED JERK. I'M HARDHEADED? HOW'D I GET THIS LUMP? OH, YEAH? WELL, MY CHIN'S WORSE THAN YOUR-- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE REALLY CUTE. YEAH. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? YOU'RE JUST A KID. I AM NOT A KID. I'M YOHEI. [ SHIMA ] HEY! ARE YOU OKAY? I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GUY WHO SAVED YOU? HEY, WAIT. HE LEAVE ALREADY? I'M RIGHT HERE. HUH? OH, HEY, YOU'RE SO SMALL I DIDN'T SEE YOU. OH, YEAH? MY DAD SAYS A GUY CAN BE SMALL AND BE A MAN... AS LONG AS HE'S BIG WHERE IT COUNTS! [ GASPS ] DON'T TALK LIKE THAT. WHY NOT? WHAT, YOU DON'T LIKE GUYS WITH BIG HEARTS OR SOMETHING? UH-- [ PEOPLE EXCLAIMING ] I WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE. HEY, WHERE YOU GOING? [ CHATTERING ] WHOA, WHAT IS THAT? WHATEVER IT IS CAN'T BE GOOD. [ MAN ] IT'S A DEMON. IT'S SAID THAT WHEN THE SEA TURNS BLACK AS INK, A DEMON THE SIZE OF A SMALL MOUNTAIN SHALL RISE FROM IT... - AND DESTROY EVERYTHING. - WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT? IT'S A LEGEND THAT'S BEEN PASSED DOWN FOR GENERATIONS. MERCY ON US. [ BIRD SINGING ] [ RIN ] UH, WHAT IS THAT? [ MAN ] A VOTIVE TABLET. FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO THIS TEMPLE'S PRIEST MADE IT. THAT'S A BIG SQUID. LIKE, REALLY BIG. THE SEA HAS TURNED BLACK FROM THE INK OF THAT MONSTER. YEAH, BUT THAT'S JUST A STORY, ISN'T IT? I WISH IT WERE. WE EXPERIENCED THIS SIX MONTHS AGO. THE SEA TURNED BLACK JUST LIKE TODAY, AND A FISHERMAN SET OUT IN HIS BOAT TO DRIVE AWAY THE DEMON. HOWEVER, TO THIS DAY, THAT MAN HAS NOT RETURNED. JUST OUR LUCK. I DIDN'T THINK WE'D BE HEARING ABOUT DEMONS THIS FAR FROM SCHOOL. DON'T YOU THINK IT'D BE COOL IF OUR VERY FIRST MISSION WAS TO GO AND KILL THAT DEMON? [ GRUNTS ] WHAT THE HELL? [ MEOWS ] OW! WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING. LOOK, OUR LITTLE FRIEND'S BACK. YOU KNOW, WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU. WHERE'D YOU DISAPPEAR TO? HMM! NOWHERE. NOWHERE, HUH? MAN, YOU ARE ONE HARDHEADED KID. YOU'RE TELLING ME. - DOES YOUR HEAD STILL HURT? - YEAH. OF COURSE IT DOES. - SORRY ABOUT THAT. - [ GASPS ] COME ON, KID. YOU HAD TO SEE US COMING YOUR WAY, DIDN'T YOU? YOU COULD'VE JUST GIVEN US A LITTLE ROOM TO GET BY. NO WAY. MY DAD TOLD ME THAT A REAL MAN WALKS A STRAIGHT PATH, AND THAT'S ALL I WAS DOING. I THINK YOUR OLD MAN MEANT THAT METAPHORICALLY. AND BESIDES, IF YOU ONLY GO STRAIGHT, I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'RE GONNA WIND UP LOST. NO ONE'S THAT DUMB. DO ANY OF YOU KNOW HOW TO GET TO THE PET STORE? - [ BOTH ] HUH? - I NEED TO GET TO THE PET STORE. I DREW A MAP OF IT, BUT I CAN'T FIND IT. HMM. YEAH. YEAH, WHAT? YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT? [ KAMIKI ] IT STILL BLOWS MY MIND... THAT WE HAD TO GIVE DIRECTIONS TO ONE OF THE LOCALS. SHE'S RIGHT. HAVEN'T YOU EVER BEEN HERE BEFORE? YEAH, BUT MY DOG'S SICK. YOUR DOG? SO WHENEVER YOU NEED TO GO TO THE PET STORE, YOUR DOG'S THE ONE THAT TAKES YOU THERE? YEAH. SO WHAT? I KNEW IT. YOU'RE SEVERELY DIRECTIONALLY CHALLENGED. I DON'T WANNA BRAG, BUT MY DAD'S ON A WHOLE 'NOTHER LEVEL. HE WAS, LIKE, TOTALLY DIRECTIONALLY CHALLENGED. I WOULDN'T BRAG ABOUT THAT. ANYWAY, WHY DOES EVERY TOPIC REVERT BACK TO YOUR DAD? 'CAUSE HE WAS PRETTY AWESOME. YOU MEAN, HE'S-- SIX MONTHS AGO HE SHIPPED OUT TO KILL THAT THING, BUT HE DIDN'T COME BACK. WAIT. YOUR DAD WAS THAT GUY? AND THAT THING HE WAS AFTER WAS-- THE DEMON OF THE DEEP SEAS. THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL THE THING THAT KILLED MY DAD. I SWORE THAT NO MATTER WHAT, I'D FIND IT AND KILL IT. [ GASPS ] [ TSUBAKI ] THANKS FOR ALL THE HARD WORK. DIG IN. [ SHIMA ] SQUID SASHIMI, SQUID NOODLES SWEET-AND-SOUR SQUID. [ KAMIKI ] SQUID AND NATTO, SQUID INK SPAGHETTI? [ GROANS ] EVERYTHING HERE'S GOT SQUID IN IT. THAT'S RIGHT. BON APPÉTIT. YEAH, BUT IT'S LIKE, DON'T WE HAVE ANYTHING BESIDES SQUID? NO, WE DON'T. DO YOU KNOW WHY? NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO CATCH ANYTHING IN THESE WATERS EXCEPT SQUID. - IT'S DRIVING EVERYONE SQUIDLY. - [ BOTH GROAN ] HOWEVER, ON THE UPSIDE, YOU CAN ALL SQUID OUT TILL YOU GET SICK. [ CHUCKLES ] THAT'S WHY NO ONE BOUGHT OUR SQUID. IT FIGURES. - [ RIN ] A KRAKEN? - IF WE'RE TALKING... ABOUT INK-SPEWING DEMONS OF THE SEA, THAT'S MY GUESS. THIS BOOK, THE NATURAL HISTORY OF NORWAY, HAS A PASSAGE THAT TELLS HOW IF A KRAKEN'S AROUND, THE SEA WILL TURN PITCH BLACK FROM ITS INK. [ SHIMA ] SO THAT THING'S THE REASON... WHY FISHERMAN CAN'T CATCH ANYTHING BUT SQUID. OKAY, WE FIGURED OUT A KRAKEN'S DOING THIS, BUT IS THERE ANY WAY TO DESTROY IT? ONE WOULD HAVE TO KNOW THE DEMON OF THE DEEP SEA'S FATAL VERSE. IT'S BELIEVED TO BE THE LETTER TO THE EPHESIANS 1:18. OTHER THAN THAT, THE OPTIONS ARE LIMITED. I'M AFRAID YOUR LITTLE FRIEND CAN'T DESTROY IT BY HIMSELF. - [ GASPS ] - [ CELL PHONE RINGING ] [ GASPS ] WHAT IS IT, HONEY? WHAT? AGAIN? DON'T WORRY, KITTY CAT. I'M ON MY WAY. SOMETHING JUST CAME UP, SO I HAVE TO GO FOR A BIT. UH, YEAH. YOU CAN TAKE THE DAY OFF TOMORROW. WE'VE HIRED A PROPER EMPLOYEE TO WORK PART TIME AT THE OCEAN HOUSE. WHAT'S HE MEAN, PROPER EMPLOYEE? WHAT ARE WE, INTERNS? WHO CARES ABOUT THAT? I WANNA KNOW WHO KITTY CAT IS. HUH. OKUMURA, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS? WHAT? WE'RE GONNA SWIM OUR ASSES OFF. RIGHT ON! WHAT THE-- I'M SORRY, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU. I WANT YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT YOHEI BOY DOESN'T GET ANYWHERE NEAR THAT DEMON. THAT'S RIGHT, YOU'RE BABY-SITTING TOMORROW. BYE-BYE. [ BOTH GROAN ] YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE REALLY CUTE. [ SIGHS ] [ THINKING ] WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? IT'S YOU. HEY, WHAT'S UP? WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? HERE. - WHAT IS IT? - IT'S AN OINTMENT. MY DAD ALWAYS TOOK IT WITH HIM WHEN HE WENT OUT TO SEA. PUT SOME ON YOUR HEAD. IT REALLY WORKS. - YOU CAME HERE TO GIVE ME THIS? - [ LAUGHS ] HEY! [ GASPS ] SORRY. I'M SORTA LOST HERE. HOW DO I GET HOME? [ SNORING ] [ KURO ] WAKE UP, RIN. IT'S THE SEA AGAIN. IT'S SERIOUS. HUH? NOT AGAIN. I'M SURE THAT KID'S SEEING THIS TOO. I JUST HOPE HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING STUPID. I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON HIM. IZUMO? YEAH, WHAT? HE SAVED MY LIFE, DIDN'T HE? ANYWAY, IT BUGS ME WHEN PEOPLE GO OFF AND DO SOMETHING HALF-COCKED. [ PANTING ] SHE SAYS WE DON'T NEED TO COME OUT THERE YET. SHE'S GOTTA BE HUNGRY BY NOW. DON'T YOU THINK IT'S KINDA WEIRD? I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE HER TO GET SO WORRIED ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE. HMM. [ KAMIKI ] HEY, ARE YOU GONNA SIT THERE AND KEEP WATCHING ALL NIGHT? I'M GONNA WAIT AS LONG AS IT TAKES... UNTIL THAT THING SHOWS UP. BUT IF IT REALLY IS A DEMON OUT THERE, THEN THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN KILL IT ALL BY YOURSELF. BUTT OUT, WILL YA? IT KILLED MY DAD, DIDN'T IT? IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO, I'M GONNA KILL THAT DAMN THING. [ SIGHS ] YOU'RE REALLY SOMETHING, YOU KNOW THAT? LISTEN, HAVE YOU EVEN THOUGHT THIS THROUGH? 'CAUSE NO MATTER HOW BAD YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING, SOME THINGS JUST CAN'T BE DONE. OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS, BUT-- BUT YOU'RE BEING STUPID, AND YOU'RE GONNA GET BURNED. SO? WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET BURNED, WHAT? DO YOU RUN AWAY? - [ GASPS ] - KNOW WHAT MY DAD SAID? HE SAID THAT PEOPLE ONLY SAY NEGATIVE THINGS... WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE IN THEMSELVES. THAT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED OR CONFUSED, THEY WANT EVERYONE ELSE TO FEEL LIKE THEY DO. WHY, YOU-- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? LISTEN, YOU. FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I'VE GOT A TON OF CONFIDENCE. THEN WHAT DO YOU CARE? IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU LOSE YOUR WAY. THING IS, YOU CAN'T CHICKEN OUT ONCE YOU'VE MADE UP YOUR MIND. [ GASPS ] THAT'S ANOTHER THING MY DAD ALWAYS SAID. AND I KNOW WHEN HE FOUND THAT DEMON, MY DAD MADE UP HIS MIND AND DIDN'T HESITATE. I'M NOT GONNA HESITATE EITHER. - I'M GONNA TAKE THAT DEMON ON, JUST LIKE HE-- - [ SPLASHING ] [ GASPING ] THERE IT IS! [ SCREECHING ] THAT'S HIM, ALL RIGHT. [ GASPS ] WAIT, YOHEI! - NO WAY! - IT-IT REALLY IS A DEMON. WHERE'S CAPTAIN NEMO WHEN YOU NEED HIM? WHATEVER. JUST READ THE SUTRA. IT'S NOT A SUTRA. IT'S AN ARIA. WHOA, WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I HAVEN'T FIGURED THAT OUT YET. BUT WE HAVE TO STOP IT OR IT'LL DESTROY THE VILLAGE. BESIDES, THERE'S THAT KID. HE COULD GET HURT IF HE TRIES ANYTHING. [ SIGHS ] RIGHT. HERE GOES NOTHING. "THEN WITH THE EYES OF YOUR HEARTS ENLIGHTENED, YOU WILL KNOW THE HOPE TO WHICH HE HAS CALLED YOU. HIS INHERITANCE AMONG THE SAINTS OF THE UNLIMITED GREATNESS... THE GLORY THAT IS OF-- OF HIS POWER FOR US WHO BELIEVE." IT'S NOT WORKING. YOU THINK MAYBE IT'S 'CAUSE SQUIDS CAN'T HEAR? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? CAN'T YOU SEE THAT THING'S GOT GINORMOUS EARS? SERIOUSLY? YOU KNOW, THOSE THINGS AREN'T EARS. THEY'RE FINS, MAN! THEY ARE? REALLY? [ SHRIEKING ] [ SHOUTING ] - [ SCREECHING ] - KURO! - [ SNARLING ] - [ ROARING ] WHOA. THIS IS LIKE A MONSTER MOVIE. KICK HIS ASS, KURO! [ SNARLING ] ATTABOY, KURO! NOT GOOD. WHY NOT? YOU DON'T KNOW THAT EITHER? THE THING ABOUT CATS IS-- [ SHOUTS ] KURO! [ WEAKLY ] RIN. KURO, ARE YOU OKAY? I'M DIZZY. CATS CAN'T EAT RAW SQUID. IT PARALYZES THEM. WHERE'S YOHEI? FOR REAL? [ KAMIKI ] DID HE COME THIS WAY? NO. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS. REALLY? OH, NO. DON'T TELL ME HE GOT LOST AGAIN. [ ROARING ] IT'S UP TO ME. HEY! THAT SETTLES IT. I HUMBLY APPEAL TO THEE, OH, GODDESS INARI. [ SHIMA ] WATCH OUT, IZUMO! I CAN'T SUMMON THEM. [ BLUBBERING ] [ SHRIEKING ] [ ALL GASPING ] - I'M GONNA KILL THAT THING. - IT'S YOHEI. WAIT. WHERE'S HE GOING? STUPID KID. [ SHRIEKING ] [ RIN ] YOU'RE IN WAY OVER YOUR HEAD. GET AWAY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU'RE JUST A KID... AND THAT DEMON'S NOT MESSING AROUND. SHUT UP AND STAY OUT OF MY WAY! I'M GONNA KILL THAT ROTTEN DEMON, AND I'M GONNA GET REVENGE FOR MY DAD. HEY! [ SHRIEKING ] I DID IT! [ SHOUTING ] OH, CRAP! [ BOTH GASP ] DAMN IT. WHAT AM I GONNA DO? [ SHOUTING ] [ MAN ] AHOY! AHOY! YOHEI! AHOY! YOHEI! YOHEI! WHA-- WHO'S THAT GUY? YOHEI! [ GASPS ] - THAT SOUNDS LIKE-- - YOHEI! IT'S DAD! HUH? IT'S-- IT'S DAD! WHAT THE-- [ YOHEI ] AHOY, DAD! GOOD WORK, EVERYONE. BY THE WAY, SIDEBURN-- UM, MR. TSUBAKI-- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? WELL, I WASN'T SURE IF IT WAS A KRAKEN. BUT IF IT TURNED OUT IT WAS, I KNEW WE NEEDED A PROPER STRATEGY TO FIGHT IT. THEN I DISCOVERED THAT THERE WASN'T ANY REAL DANGER. [ FATHER ] I TRIED, BUT I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET BACK. I MADE IT TO A DESERTED ISLAND AND STAYED THERE FOR A BIT, THEN STRUCK OUT TO SEA AGAIN. I FLOATED AROUND AND TRIED TO FIND JAPAN WITH THE HELP OF THAT SQUID, BUT THAT THING'S GOT NO SENSE OF DIRECTION. BUT I THOUGHT THAT SQUID WAS YOUR ENEMY. YOHEI, MY BOY, YOU NEED TO LEARN TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE. - HUH? - THAT'S WHAT I REALIZED DURING OUR BATTLE. HE'S FLEXIBLE IN MIND, BODY AND SOUL. BE LIKE THE SQUID. HE TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF, SO WHY CAN'T WE ALL? BUT YOU SAID ONCE A MAN DECIDES TO DO SOMETHING, HE'S GOTTA FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT. YOHEI! ENOUGH. BE LIKE THE FLAVOR OF SQUID SASHIMI. WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN? A MAN ALSO HAS TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO CHANGE HIS MIND. THAT'S WHAT BEING A MAN'S ALL ABOUT. [ YOHEI ] UH, OKAY. YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M WAY MORE MATURE NOW BECAUSE OF THIS. OH, GOD. [ GRUNTS ] COME HERE, YOHEI! DAD! [ SNIFFLING ] THAT'S SO AWESOME. SERIOUSLY? EVEN DEMONS CAN HAVE A CHANGE OF HEART. THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO TEACH YOU. AND IF ANYTHING, THAT ALONE MADE THE TRIP OUT HERE WORTH IT. THAT'S TOTAL B.S. [ GROANS ] GEEZ! THIS SUCKS! ♪♪ [ MAN SINGING IN JAPANESE ] HUH? HEY, IT'S THAT KID. COME TO SAY GOOD-BYE? MM-HMM. IS YOUR DOG FEELING BETTER? YEAH. THIS IS SHIRO. LOOK AT HIS EYEBROWS. AREN'T THEY CUTE? EYEBROWS? UH-HUH. THAT'S WHAT I SAID. [ SCREAMING ] [ JET ENGINE ROARS ] [ HOWLING ] [ GIGGLES ] [ BOTH GASP ] YEAH, WHAT? OH, NOTHING. JUST WONDERING WHAT'S SO FUNNY IS ALL. WHAT ELSE CAN I DO BUT LAUGH? THIS TRIP WAS THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING EVER. HMM! YEAH. I GUESS YOU HAVE A POINT THERE. [ LAUGHING ] TOTALLY... RIDICULOUS. WHATEVER. THIS FEELS GREAT. [ AMAIMON ] AN AMUSEMENT PARK? [ MEPHISTO ] YOU'RE FINALLY IN THE MOOD TO PLAY WITH HIM. [ SHIMA ] OOH, WOW. YOU SURE LOOK CUTE, MORIYAMA. [ RIN ] AM I SEEING THINGS, OR IS HER SKIRT, LIKE, WAY, WAY TOO SHORT?
