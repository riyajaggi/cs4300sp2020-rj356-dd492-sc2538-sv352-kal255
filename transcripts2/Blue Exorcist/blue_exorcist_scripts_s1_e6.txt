THIS CAFETERIA'S GOT LOBSTER ON THE MENU. - DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING I SAID? - [ RIN ] WOW! FRENCH, CHINESE, ITALIAN-- THEY'VE GOT EVERYTHING. [ YUKIO ] OF COURSE. TRUE CROSS ACADEMY'S A SCHOOL FOR THE PRIVILEGED. [ CHUCKLES ] I FINALLY MADE IT INTO THE WORLD OF HIGH SOCIETY. YOU HAVE TO BUY A TICKET FROM THE VENDING MACHINE FIRST. ♪ WONDER WHAT I'LL GET ♪ WHAT THE HELL? TELL ME THESE PRICES HAVE AN EXTRA ZERO ON THE END. AGAIN, THIS IS A RICH KIDS' SCHOOL. STUCK UP RICH KIDS, WHEN I GET THROUGH WITH YOU-- [ GROWLS ] CALM DOWN, RIN. THE "A" LUNCH IS ONLY 1,800 YEN. I'LL PAY FOR IT IF YOU JUST CALM DOWN. [ MEPHISTO ] YOU WANT ME TO LOWER THE PRICES? I'M AFRAID THAT WON'T BE POSSIBLE. TO PROVIDE FIRST-RATE CUISINE, WE MUST PURCHASE FIRST-RATE INGREDIENTS, HIRE FIRST-RATE CHEFS, ETCETERA, ETCETERA. WHY FIRST RATE? IT'S A STUDENT CAFETERIA. DINING IS CULTURE. A PERSON'S LIFE IS ENRICHED... BY EXPERIENCING FIRST-RATE CUISINE. [ CHIMING ] FINALLY. [ SLURPING ] THIS COMING FROM SOMEONE EATING INSTANT NOODLES? AT LEAST GIVE US AN ALLOWANCE SO WE CAN EAT, MAN. UH-OH. HOW COULD I FORGET SUCH AN IMPORTANT DETAIL. SO SORRY. YOU ARE THE SON OF SATAN, BUT EVEN YOU NEED A LITTLE CASH TO GET YOU THROUGH THE DAY. A 2,000 YEN BILL! THOSE THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SUPER RARE. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE ACTUALLY HAS ONE. I CAN BUY 10 YAKISOBA BUNS WITH THIS. OH, BEFORE I FORGET, YOU'LL BE PAID ON THE 10TH OF EVERY MONTH. HUH? FOR THE WHOLE MONTH? THIS? FOR BOTH OF US? CORRECT. ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? DO I DETECT DISPLEASURE? YOU CAN HAVE THIS HUNDRED YEN NOTE INSTEAD. IT'S OBSOLETE, BUT THE PORTRAIT IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE. LIKE I CARE WHAT YOUR FREAKING FAVORITES ARE. [ GROWLS ] CONTROL YOURSELF, RIN! [ YUKIO ] REMEMBER WHAT DAD USED TO SAY? "MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE." DAD'S LECTURES AREN'T GONNA FILL OUR STOMACHS, YOU KNOW. I MEAN, ARE YOU COOL WITH THIS? ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE LAME ALLOWANCE OF 2,000 YEN A MONTH? WELL, I HAVE MY JOB AS AN INSTRUCTOR, AND I GET PAID PRETTY WELL AS AN EXORCIST, SO I'M GOOD. YOU TRAITOR! I'M GONNA-- [ GRUNTS ] HOLD IT. I KNOW HOW YOU CAN MAKE IT THOUGH SCHOOL... WITHOUT STARVING TO DEATH. HUH? - DO OUR OWN COOKING? - YEAH. I'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY TO BUY GROCERIES, AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE LUNCH FOR THE TWO OF US. THAT WAY I CAN SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT STARVING. BESIDES, COOKING'S THE ONLY THING YOU DO WELL. AND YOU KNOW WHAT EVERYONE SAYS-- GIRLS LIKE GUYS WHO CAN COOK. FOR REAL? THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO BE AWESOME. HE'LL HAVE TO GET UP EARLY IF HE HAS TO MAKE LUNCH. AND IF THOSE GIRLS OFFER ME LUNCH AGAIN, I'LL HAVE AN EXCUSE. I'LL JUST SAY, "GEE, THANKS, BUT I BROUGHT MY OWN. SORRY." I GET TO KILL TWO-- NO, FOUR-- BIRDS WITH ONE LUNCH. UH, WHERE AM I GONNA COOK? IT'LL BE HARD WITHOUT A KITCHEN IN OUR ROOM. YOU CAN USE THE MAIN KITCHEN. WE'RE THE ONLY ONES LIVING THERE. WE'VE GOT THE WHOLE BUILDING ALL TO OURSELVES. [ CHOPPING VEGETABLES ] YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO COOK THIS LATE AT NIGHT. CAN'T YOU DO IT TOMORROW MORNING? YOU ALWAYS MAKE YOUR LUNCH THE NIGHT BEFORE AND STICK IT IN THE FREEZER. THE NEXT DAY YOU TAKE YOUR FROZEN LUNCH TO SCHOOL AND LET IT THAW DURING CLASS. IT SHOULD BE READY TO EAT BY NOON. YOU COULD SAY IT'S SORT OF A HOUSEWIFE'S TIP. OH, REALLY? IT WOULD BE PRETTY AMAZING... IF YOU COULD SPEND THAT AMOUNT OF ENERGY ON YOUR STUDIES. WHO ASKED YOU? TAKE A CRAP AND GO TO BED. YES, SIR. GOOD NIGHT. [ SIGHS ] I'M ALL DONE. - [ CLATTERING ] - [ GASPS ] WAS THAT A MOUSE? HUH? OH, GEEZ, IT'S REALLY LATE. [ FOOTSTEPS RECEDE ] [ FOOTSTEPS RUNNING ] - HMM? - YOU FOUR-EYED MOLE FACE! [ GRUNTS ] WHO ARE YOU CALLING A FOUR-EYED MOLE FACE? SHUT UP! I DON'T GIVE A DAMN HOW HUNGRY YOU WERE! IN THIS HOUSE, THERE'S THINGS YOU NEVER DO! - HUH? - DON'T PLAY DUMB! THAT FOOD I COOKED WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR OUR LUNCH! BUT YOU ATE IT ALL, DIDN'T YOU? COME ON, YOU KNOW I'D NEVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHO DID? YOU SAID WE'RE THE ONLY ONES LIVING IN THIS BUILDING, REMEMBER? WE ARE ALONE, AREN'T WE? WE'RE NOT. WHENEVER IT WAS TIME TO EAT, THE FOOD WAS ALWAYS READY, WAITING FOR US DOWN IN THE KITCHEN. [ RIN ] WE DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT WHO WAS DOING THE COOKING. SO THEN WHO COOKED ALL THOSE MEALS? [ CHOPPING ECHOES ] - THEY'RE HERE. - YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT WHO? [ CHOPPING CONTINUES ] GENTLEMEN, MORNING. MEPHISTO? ALL THIS TIME IT WAS YOU? YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S BEEN COOKING ALL OUR MEALS FOR US SINCE WE MOVED IN? I'VE BEEN DOING NO SUCH THING. I'M JUST A TEMPORARY REPLACEMENT. [ BOTH ] A REPLACEMENT? IN CHARGE OF YOUR MEALS IS UKOBACH. TEMPORARY. THE ONE WHO'S UKOBACH? I KNOW THAT NAME. I THINK HE'S A STOVE SPIRIT. HE SNEAKS INTO THE KITCHEN WHEN HUMANS ARE SLEEPING, AND HE MAKES THE FOOD TASTE BETTER. SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE INSTRUCTOR. GOOD ANSWER. UP TO NOW, HE'S BEEN LOYALLY CARRYING OUT HIS DUTIES HERE AS MY FAMILIAR. YESTERDAY, THOUGH, THE TWO OF YOU HAD APPARENTLY TRESPASSED ON HIS TERRITORY-- THE KITCHEN. NOW HE'S IN A FOUL MOOD, AND HAS BOYCOTTED HIS JOB. I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION. BY THE WAY, WHAT IS THIS? MY SPECIALTY-- "LITTLE DEMON-FLAVORED" OATMEAL. PLEASE, HELP YOURSELVES. [ GAGGING ] GO ON. DON'T BE SHY. HERE GOES! [ SCREAMING ] RIN, NO! ARE YOU OKAY? I HEAR GRANDMA CALLING ME. GRANDMA? WE NEVER MET OUR GRANDMA. DON'T FOLLOW HER INTO THE LIGHT. WHOEVER SHE IS, A FAMILIAR'S MISCONDUCT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ITS MASTER. UNTIL UKOBACH'S MOOD IMPROVES, I WILL TAKE CHARGE OF THIS KITCHEN AND PREPARE ALL YOUR MEALS PERSONALLY. WHAT IF HIS MOOD DOESN'T IMPROVE? HMM, I WILL BECOME YOUR PERSONAL COOK... FOR THE DURATION OF YOUR TIME HERE. - RIN! - SO, THIS UKOBACH GUY OR WHATEVER, I'M SO GONNA KICK HIS ASS. IDIOT. YOU WILL NOT KICK THE CHEF. [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] [ THUNDERCLAP ] OKAY. I PUT EVERYTHING BACK THE WAY IT WAS. SO HOW ABOUT YOU GET OVER IT ALREADY? [ GASPS ] OH, COME ON. YOU'RE STILL MAD? WHAT ARE YOU SO PISSED OFF ABOUT ANYWAY? IF YOU DON'T WANNA COOK ANYMORE, THEN GET OUT. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE WHO CAN COOK, YOU KNOW. [ THUNDERCLAP ] SO THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE. [ PANTING ] I THOUGHT I COULD LEAVE RIN ALONE BECAUSE SIR PHELES WAS THERE. I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS. [ THUNDERCLAP ] RIN! [ PANTING ] [ GASPS ] WHAT'S GOING ON? [ PANTING ] [ PANTING ] [ BOTH GASP ] - RIN! - [ APPLAUSE ] SIR PHELES, WHAT HAPPENED? THEY FOUGHT BRAVELY TO WITHIN AN INCH OF THEIR LIVES. THEIR POWERS WERE LET LOOSE, EXPLODING THROUGH THE KITCHEN. [ SHOUTING ] [ YUKIO ] THEY HAD A COOKING BATTLE? MUSCLES, THEY DISCOVERED EACH OTHER'S TALENTS. BY FLEXING THEIR CULINARY BEHOLD-- A NEW FRIENDSHIP IS BORN. YOUR FRIED RICE WAS SO AWESOME, MAN. [ SQUEAKING ] HUH? DID YOU JUST CALL MY KATSU BOWL EXCEPTIONAL? LET'S DO IT! WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE ULTIMATE LUNCH. ARE YOU IN? [ SQUEAKS ] WHAT DO YOU SAY? THAT'S MY BROTHER. DEFYING LOGIC ALL KINDS OF WAYS. [ GASPS ] WHAT YOU GOT THERE? A HOMEMADE LUNCH? UH, YES. LOOKS YUMMY.

AND SO BEGINS THE FIRST STUD PHASE OF MY LIFE. [ OMOTO ] IS THAT YOUR BROTHER? [ KASHINO ] HOW WOULD A CREEP LIKE THAT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT COOKING? [ SHOUTS ] I WANT YOU TO TEACH ME TO COOK. AND ME! TEACH ME TOO! [ NISHIWAKI ] WHAT THE HELL? THERE'S OKUMURA. LOOKS LIKE HE'S CRYING OVER HIS LUNCH. THAT POOR GUY. HE MUST REALLY BE HUNGRY. BETTER NOT LOOK HIM IN THE EYE. STUPIDITY'S CONTAGIOUS.
