 Mike D: Those skate videos that Spike did, like, they spoke to us in a a way like no other skate videos. He kind of brought skateboarding back to the people, in a sense. Pow! * The boundary, the border * Of right and wrong * The tariff is self * The freedom of feeling Hi, we're hear with Spike Jonze, the music video director. That's, like, pretty crazy to be in my kitchen in Torrance, and there's a message from Kim Gordon. Mariano: Spike went from skateboarding to making music videos. Like, no one at that point -- It's like we thought, like, that's as high as this guy's gonna go.

 ** - Ohh! - Ohh! Evans: Every skateboarder in the world was like, "Holy shit. This dude's getting an Academy Award right now. He's a skater." Jonze: [ Laughs ] What's up? Welcome back to "Epicly Later'd." I'm really excited about this episode. It's with Spike Jonze, who was a huge influence on me. I loved his photography. I'm a little nervous, 'cause this dude just in skate is somewhat of a deity. I mean, he did all these amazing photos for TransWorld. I'd say he's my favorite skate photographer. He made amazing videos like "Video Days," "Rubba Sheep." Went on to do really cool music videos, films. And one thing I really liked about him is that he still seems skate to me even though he's done everything -- Academy Award. I've seen him skate. He's a good skater. And anyway, we're gonna creep up on him. He's eating breakfast over here at this restaurant. We're gonna pick him up. We're gonna go down to Girl Skateboards and just... I'm just hoping to get whatever I can. And I'm really excited. Thank you. Oh! Dude! I was thinking, "Who is that?" [ Laughs ] You really didn't know? I thought it was the guy who owned this crane. And he's pissed at you? That intro better have been good, 'cause I'm not doing it again with him listening. O'Dell: I guess if we just start chronologically, you grew up in Maryland. We're gonna go all the way back there? Just -- just -- I just wanna get, like, a little general gist of where you're from. Man, I'm trying to -- 'Cause we'll be here for all day if I go back, like, if I just... You can do it, uh, broad strokes. The, um... Yeah. I grew up in D.C. and knew Jeff, and, you know... Um... Walt Whitman High School, class of 8-- Well, I was class of '85. Look at that hot dude. And that's Spike. He was class of '87. In the early '80s, I was a freestyle BMXer. Like, I would ride ramps. And there weren't a whole lot of us, but we had the biggest shop on the East Coast called Rockville BMX. Spike somehow, before I knew him, got a job there. So he was this little kid that would pop in and work. He looked like -- He was probably, what, 12 or 13, working there, but he looked like he was, like, 8. [ Laughing ] I mean, look how little he looked! Like, he got his nickname, "Spike," at the bike shop. Like, you know, he was Adam Spiegel to me until Jay, the guy who ran Rockville BMX, started calling him Spike. I would work there in the summertimes, only when they would have these big, like, freestyle shows. So, like, that was one of the stops all of the big teams would stop at and set up ramps in the parking lot across the street from Rockville BMX. In particular, I remember when Haro came to town -- Team Haro. They just all hit it off there, and we went out bowling and drinking and shit with them. And they loved Spike, and they kidnapped Spike and took him on the road with them. That's where he met Andy Jenkins and Mark Lewman. And they were running "Freestylin'" Magazine. Bye. Thanks for coming. He left for California within a week or two of graduating. He might not even have gone to his graduation. When it came to hiring a new guy, I needed a new guy at the magazine. For some reason, Spike popped into my head because he had this amazing personality and he had a really good way of getting along with people. And he was funny. Oh, dude! Well, thank you for that lovely introduction there, Jim Bob. But also, he did have the camera at the time so he was kind of -- That's when he started to really develop it. [ Shutter clicking ] So eventually, he moved over to pretty much being the photographer for the magazine. Announcer: You know him, you love him, Spike Jonze! [ Cheers and applause ] Freestylin's wizard with a camera! Hoffman: Spike is the definition of freestyle. I mean, you just never really know what to expect or, like, what version of Spike is surfacing. And he just has this creative energy that just blows up and you either get out of the way or you just hold on, and it can bring you anywhere. I just wanna skate down the street, do an ollie, and slap the hair off his head! I think just seeing the world a different way and just seeing it as, like, a -- as a playground and trying to find places that are less travelled to play in is kind of how Spike's looked at everything in his life, whether it was riding his skateboard or riding his bike. ** Whoo-hoo! We were all skating anyway, and you know, we developed more and more of an interest at we got to know more skaters around the area. And we knew a few pro skaters, and we had gotten to shoot them. And that was through Spike, because he was always shooting. And some of the skaters were hanging out with the BMX guys, so he would shoot the skate guys, become tight friends with them 'cause that's what he does to everyone. So then, we got sucked into that -- that industry, I guess you could say. ** Jonze: All my friends were street skating, so I just started shooting photos of the riders and skaters. Like, I'd kind of just ask a lot of questions and shoot a lot of photos and, like, take a lot of bad photos, like, take endlessly bad photos until I was like, "Oh, that one worked," and trying to figure out why it worked. And eventually, I started shooting for TransWorld. Jefferson: He was great at mixing raw with polished. As a kid, I would just sit and just study his photos in TransWorld. You know, Spike had a very unique look. There was always, like, a sense of excitement. There was always a sense of energy. Jonze: You're always trying to capture a trick the way, like, in it's best form. Like Jason Lee, like, I remember shooting some photo of him and just thinking about the right angle where, like, you know he's gonna point his nose in a certain way right about halfway through. And if you're two feet over, the trick's gonna look totally different. The fist time I actually ever met Spike is the time I shot my first Blind ad, backside nosegrind across a bench in Burbank, California. Spike came out, and I didn't know who he was. And he had a camera bag, and I was just like, "Oh, it's cool, man." I'm like, "Where'd you get the camera? Is it your mom's or something?" You know what I mean? And he's like, "No, I'm a photographer. I shoot." Spike felt like me, looked like me, talked like me. And he has a real gift with, like, taking people out of their element, making them feel comfortable, and just being a real person before a photographer. His photos went to TransWorld, but he worked at World Industries. So he shot Gonz. He shot Jason Lee. He shot Ron Chatman. He shot Jeremy Klein. His photography is, like, burned into my brain. There's one, it's a sequence at night. And it was Jeremy Klein doing a kickflip backside grab off a curb. But it was one frame with, like, flash sequence. That was my childhood right there -- Spike's photos. ** I mean, the first real guys I skated with a lot in terms of -- and photographed a lot were, like, right when World started, 'cause Rocco was also in Torrance. World was only, like, four people at the time. So he's like, "Hey, you wanna shoot the ads?" And so I started shooting his ads. You know, Rocco was really smart and really witty. And from the beginning, the spirit was always the same which is like, "Oh, we can't do that?" Yeah, we can. It was just a wild thing going on over there because Rocco would let it happen, you know? He was probably one of the first to create a skateboard company as a skateboarder for skateboarders. And it was very successful at that, as well. Jefferson: I mean, it was World. Like, World dominated what was cool in skating then. And Spike was right there. Jonze: That's how I went from photos to video. It was like I was shooting his ads and we were out skating one day, and I asked him if he was gonna do a skate video. And he's like, "Yeah, I wanna do one. I just don't have time to shoot it. Do you wanna do it?" I was like, "Yeah, cool, okay." And I didn't know how. I didn't know anything about that. And he just gave me the company credit card and he's like, "Yeah, okay." And he's just right there, and, like, I think we were, like, at some spot, and he gave me the company credit card. And he said, "Go find -- Yeah, go buy a camera and editing -- and some editing stuff." ** It was like the brats took over, had their own skateboard company. * 7:00, gotta get up * Alarm clock, mom yelling at 7:00 * * See her downstairs, it's time for a shower * * Went to the school bus stop * Waited at the bus stop with my friends * Aah! * Only had one, sorry This is Jeremy Klein, professional beast of his class. [ Laughter ] Jonze: It was just like anything went. Seriously, gonna lose our jobs here. That's what happens when you give a bunch of, like, 18-year-old kids the keys to the whatever -- some metaphor for the kingdom. [ High-pitched ] Hey! Brought the plumber over here to fix your shit now with your fucking pipes! For real. - This is a worm. - [ Laughs ] That's so thick. Ugh! [ Laughter ] Woman: Come on. Oh, not chew it up. - Okay, come on out here, then. - You're going down, Mark. [ Laughter ] Ow! Aah! - That's cool. - The Blind video's in there? Yeah. But I don't know where the master is. Might've left it at the dubbing house, probably. We weren't really paying that much attention. That's my claim to fame right there. Well, his impact on skateboarding is enormous 'cause I think it feels to me like 9 skaters out of 10 say their favorite skate video in history is "Video Days." ** ** "Video Days" was something that was, like, hugely influential to me. Typically, skate videos would be a single trick, edit, another single trick, edit, you know, and so on and so on. Not many people were just pushing around with a camera, fisheye, and following somebody as they're doing a trick here, a trick here, and a trick there. It shows your style, the way you push, how you look on a skateboard. The little nuances, the things that, like, a skate nerd like me would geek out on. Carnie: "Video Days" was just, you know, raw. He kind of brought skateboarding back to the people, in a sense. "Video Days" was just this -- the reality of how skateboarding was -- a bunch of dumb fucking kids riding around in a car drinking 40-ouncers. Like, that's why it was so impactful. It was because it was actually skateboarding. O'Dell: Tell me about "Video Days." You told me before it sort of was going into Mark's world, in a way. Yeah, I guess the video -- I mean, again, like, at the time I don't think I would've articulated it, but I -- like this. But I think what I was doing was I just wanted to make a video that felt like hanging out with Mark. - Okay, come on out here, then. - You're going down, Mark. Gonzales: Okay, good. [ Laughter ] It was kind of, like, never explained 'cause Mark, you can't -- you can't ever fully understand how he thinks and why he does what he does. And I wanted the video to feel that, like you don't quite explain anything. Lean forward and look at the mirror. Lean close to the mirror. ** ** He just had endless ideas. He's like, "I've got a new trick. It's like you slide on your nose on top of the curb." I was like, "What?" And we at World and he's like, "I don't know. I haven't figured out how to get out of it yet, but it's like this." And he went up and did a noseblunt slide on the red curb. I was like, "That is ridiculous." And I was like -- I could never imagine him getting out of it. It didn't seem like it was possible 'cause you'd never seen it before. And in his mind, anything was possible. And we went up to this high school in Santa Monica. It had that kinked rail. And again, he was like -- We're parked outside, and we stop. And he said, "I wanna do that rail." And we're all looking at it like, "But it's got a bend in it. It's got a huge, like, kink in it. You can't do that." And he's like, "No, I think I could if I just, like, leaned back I could just, like, board-side through it." And we're all like, "What? Is this possible?" ** And I think it was the third try, he lands and rolls away. And we're like, "Holy shit!" And we're like -- For the rest of the day we're like, "Now we don't even need to do anything." Like, "We got that? That's crazy." And then he just kept going. ** ** So then, like, by, like, noon, he rolled his ankle. We're like, "Okay, I guess we're done." And we went back and cut it in, and his part was done. - Yeah! - Watch that truck! [ Laughs ] * You're like a crazy person walking around * Mark Gonzales and Spike Jonze were a funny combo together. - Okay, start recording. - Come over. Let me use one of my foot techniques. - [ Laughs ] - Okay, come over. Mariano: They were kind of like two kids, like, beefing with each other, like -- And I know they would, like, wrestle and fight. And it'd kind of, like, get serious. - Pow! - Ugh! Oh! Oof! And I think that Spike working with Mike Gonzales from such a young age... Okay, Mike. You got that one. - Enough! - ...it made him to be able to adapt and to work with anybody, any artist, anything in the world 'cause Mark Gonzales is just, like, a million people. [ Speaking Spanish ] I've been sober for about five months now. I just -- I quit told -- cold turkey. [ Speaking Spanish ] I don't smoke anymore, either. I just keep 'em behind my ear for good luck. * Ooh, ooh ** Aah! Jonze: Yeah, Mark! [ Indistinct ] At one point, Mark goes, "You know, I wanna go get some clips in Mexico." We go to Mexico. We go to the skate park, and then we start driving up in these mountains. And Mark's like, "I wanna fucking drive the car off a cliff." I was just total, like, you know, just, like, Spike and Mark just crazy guerrilla-style freestyling it. You gotta go faster, though. Car in neutral, stick on the gas, like, propped in there. And Mark's like, "I'm just gonna chop it with my hand." And, like, you only get one shot at that, you know what I mean? The car flies off it. It's just like probably everything that Spike does in life. Comes up with the crazy idea, and it ends up, like, working out perfect. Okay. That was rad, Mark. We pulled it off. ** O'Dell: So your mom thought you really died? Thought they died. You know, she called me up. I sent her the video and she's like, "That's so sad. They all..." You know? "How are their parents?" [ Laughs ] I'm like, "No, Mom. They didn't die." ** When we finished the video, Mark went to see Sonic Youth at the Palladium. And he was -- When he was leaving, he was driving by and he saw them getting into a bus. And he's like, "Hey, you guys! We made a skate video." And he gave them the video, the VHS copy of the video. That's basically how I got into music videos, is that Kim Gordon called me, saw that video and was like, "Hey, we're making this music video. We wanna have skateboarding in it. Will you come shoot it?" ** * I can never forget you * The way you rock the girls Kim and I and Thurston watched that video where the kids are in the car and the video is they just drive it off the cliff. [Laughs] And I was like, I thought it was brilliant. And I found out that this kid, Spike Jonze, was behind it. So that's when I contacted him and started to talk to him about being in the video. Jonze: Tamra was directing the video. She said, "Come hang out as much as you want." I was like, "Okay." And so I hung out every day. It was like film school in a month. Like in one month, a crash course in what a production designer is, what a cinematographer is. I got to shoot a 16mm camera for the first time. He'd never really done it in a professional way like that, like real cameras, like a real video. And we're just about to shoot, and he stops. And he pulls me over, and he's like, "I've never done this before." And there's, like, an entire crew. And I just looked back at him and I was like, "Nobody knows that." [ Chuckles ] ** Jonze: Thurston, when I met him, he told me that they liked that video a lot because it felt voyeuristic. I was like, "Okay, cool. Thank you. But -- what's 'voyeuristic' mean?" [ Laughs ] ** - Should we go walk around? - Yeah. This is your photo? This is actually behind our house in -- This is Sonic Youth. The first frame, I shot the whole thing. And then I went in and shot six in a row and then six in a row and then six in a row. There's times in your life that, like, your life is changed. You know? And it's like Andy and Lew hiring me at the magazine when I was 17, or Rocco saying, "Yeah, you wanna make skate videos? Okay, here's a credit card." Or, you know, Kim calling me and asking me to make this music video. And you don't really know at the time that it is, but it's certainly, like, exciting. And it's like, "Whoa." That's, like, pretty crazy to be in my kitchen in Torrance and there's a message from Kim Gordon. But at the time I'm just excited to kind of make stuff with, you know, and just keep -- So we're making magazines and taking photos, and also that's when I met Rick. And, so, I lived with Megan. One time I come home, and there's this, like, blue Acura in front of the house. I'm like, "Oh... Looks like Rick Howard's car. That's weird." And I go in, and Rick Howard's there. And I got to know Rick really well, and I loved him. And he basically, within a month, lived with us. - And, uh... - 'Cause he was dating... He was dating Megan, yeah. Megan ran sales at World. Spike! What? You always wait till I'm mad to start antagonizing me. What's so funny, then? [ Chuckling ] Nothing. Aaah! By this point now, World's big. Like, it went from four people to I don't know how many people -- 80 people or something. It was big. The emergence of World came on so strong and hard. And there was a lot of money. And I remember there was a lot of pressure at that stage. That's when things started to escalate and get serious. And it was pushing guys. New guys are coming in. And I remember the quote, "Out with the old, in with the new." Jonze: That your new board? - What? - Is that new? - Yeah. Jeremy broke it. - [ Laughs ] It lost its innocence, and I think Spike saw that, felt that. And I remember thinking, "This is the beginning of the end of that." All this stuff was happening that we weren't all that comfortable with sometimes. I think, you know, we just liked it when it was smaller, when it was, like, this little thing. And so, I think that's partially why Girl started. It was just to go and so this smaller thing again. It was just on a whim, like, random night. Like, "All right. We're gonna do a company," you know, that actually became, like, a real thought. "Let's just try something different," just like everything else that was going on at that time. [ People cheering ] O'Dell: How did that go down? How did you guys all... Not -- Not pretty. [ Laughing ] Not good. 'Cause basically what happened was we left without telling him. Like, gave him no warning whatsoever, which was obviously not cool. You know, we were friends with Rocco and friends with Rodney. And I talked to Rocco last year about it. And it was really funny 'cause he was like, "You're doing exactly what I did, so, like, how am I to be upset about it?" ** This is, like, the very first board series that we did. It's everybody's name with their -- with the word "Girl" in the language of their nationality. [ Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture" plays ] ** ** ** The idea was just making a skateboard company that was fun and that everybody was stoked about, like, that everybody was part of it. I think, you know, the team really was, like, it was the guys Rick wanted to skate with. ** When Girl first formed, I knew Spike was gonna be a part of it. But I don't think at that time we thought about, like, "Oh, we're gonna make, like, pretty cool videos and, like, fun skits." That didn't even cross my mind. ** ** Mariano: Why Spike is the way he is is because he always took it to another level. You know what I mean? And I could say that for skits like -- Some of my favorite skits, like, you know, Eric Koston Charlie Chaplin. That was the first one. I was like, "Wow, this is, like, it's more than just skateboarding." That was a really cool piece. ** ** Koston: You think about the Chaplin thing like, that was all because of him. We trusted Spike and what he was trying to get us to do. ** ** Howard: The woods session was fun. It was based around, like, bad acting. ** When he has a vision, he's focused and there's no fucking around. But when he's not, it's like he's a maniac. I can't believe he's still alive, this guy, seriously. [ Laughs ] He's incredible. This was over in the Richmond District. We were driving the car up and down the street and driving on the sidewalk, leaving skids on this woman's suburban street. And then she leaned her head out the window and was like, "Get out of here! I'm gonna call the cops!" And Jeff, he was like, "Put your head back in the window, lady! We're trying to make a realistic movie here!" [ Laughs ] ** ** ** O'Dell: Do you remember if the "Goldfish" intro was shot first, or Sabotage? Hmm. That's a good question. So, are we biting Sabotage? [ Inhales sharply ] ** ** ** * I can't stand it, I know you planned it * "Goldfish," "Sabotage" -- the timeline's almost kind of irrelevant 'cause it's sort of like one of the things of, like, Spike just trying to figure stuff out with a lot of bunch of his friends. We were into this whole thing of, like, kind of using spirit gum and putting on mustaches and wigs and just becoming whoever. And Spike was totally sort of an integrated part of this dress-up campaign. Spike and Yauch, they kind of figured out any bit of driving -- getting air over the crest of hills, bottoming out. I mean, it's not like the shocks were in great condition when we probably bought the thing. * Sabotage People went ape-shit crazy in a way that we hadn't really had for, like, any other song, ever. So that was kind of like this holy shit moment. Wow. This is like this thing that we made that's bigger than all of us. Like, that era of music videos, he was just, like, dreaming shit up and making videos, like, all the time. And it was -- I think it was very carefree and like, "This would be fun, to do this. Let's do this," you know? Jonze: Growing up in Manhattan, I performed with several b-boy posses. And that's -- Our background's sort of -- They're some of our inspiration. It's all his choreography also, let me tell ya. Original stuff. [ Cheers and applause ] [ Dinosaur Jr.'s "Feel the Pain" plays ] ** ** Spiegel: He did this video for Dinosaur Jr. called "Feel the Pain" when I was, like, 14. And he had me come on set, and I showed up real early, right before they started shooting. It's like 6:00 in the morning. And he was like, 25, directing this video. And the whole crew's there watching. And he starts tearing this golf cart around, like, around the street we were shooting on, and flips the golf cart, like, immediately. Flips it. Everybody's like, "Who is this kid director?" Like, "He already flipped a golf cart? We haven't even started shooting yet." ** I remember when Spike kind of started blowing up, like, you know? It's like he started doing, like, some of those, like, Pharcyde videos. And at the end, you have that Mark Gonzales-like piece that gets, like, shattered. It was kind of like a shout to, like, skaters. Like, "I ain't forgot you. I'm moving up, but I ain't forgot you." And we were like, you know, it's like, when everyone seen that, it's was like, "Oh!" Like, you know, he counted us in. And, like, I knew at that point, I'm like, "Dude, this guy's gonna go so much farther than just music videos." And that was a big thing. Like, Spike went from skateboarding to making music videos. Like, no one at that point -- It's like, we thought, like, that's as high as this guy's gonna go, an MTV music video. He's done it. He arrived. You know? No one's thinking Oscars yet. [ Applause ] And the Oscar goes to... Spike Jonze. [ Cheers and applause ] ** Hi. We're here with Spike Jonze, the music video director. He's -- He just has a few minutes. Today's July 29, 1996. I don't wanna waste too much of your time, so we'll get right into it. How did you get into making music videos, Spike? Man: Um, well, basically, I -- I'm a big fan of music. And I like videos. What do you think about music videos? Koston: The success was just happening pretty rapidly, but I guess when you're in the moment, you don't -- you don't really see that. You're just like, "Oh, sick. He's, like -- It's cool. He's doing a bunch of stuff, and he's busy." But I didn't really look at the success of it. It was just like, it's Spike. [ Indistinct chatter ] The success started to really hit when it became, like, feature films. That's when you're like, "Whoa. Okay, whoa." I feel like that's when it kind of sunk in. We just finished shooting and, uh, on Thursday. Bangs: So this is the first time that you directed a feature film? Yeah. The people that worked on it were mostly people that -- that I knew from music videos and commercials. The first time I met John Malkovich was in this really... [ Grunts ] [ Shifter clicks ] [ Sighs ] It was cool being a kid, seeing Spike's career go from skate photographer to video maker to music video to film maker, and seeing him eventually go on and make feature films, commercials, et cetera. And that all stems back from being a skateboarder with a video camera. O'Dell: In between doing music videos and then doing feature films, I feel like you did some commercials or things that were, like -- Was there maybe Gonz in a chair going down a hill? Oh, yeah. I never did a straight-up, like, car commercial. I would try to do something that, like, I thought was gonna be interesting or that was more like, "How can I do more stuff with my friends?" ** Like, I loved making stuff with Mark so, like -- He's so fun to film. Even though he's asleep for most of that commercial, he just -- his face is funny. [ Truck horn blares ] The end of the commercial's the only time he's gotta wake up, and it's the only point he has to do a lot of actually acting. He wakes up and he looks up, and there's a truck in the window. And I needed him to look up and kind of smile at it and like, "Oh, that's a cool truck." The first take, he does it. And he kind of looks over at me, and he's like, "Spike, I don't wanna do this anymore. This is lame." And... [ Laughs ] And the people from the agency are completely like, "This guy fucking cast his friend, and his friend doesn't wanna do it?" Jefferson: That's what I love about Spike, the way he's always involved skaters in anything he's done. To me, you know, he's never forgotten where he's come from with skating. ** ** I remember we were shooting at the Pink Motel, and, like, Drew Barrymore is there, you know? It's like, that life Spike lived -- lives -- it's so Hollywood, but it's so not, you know? Like, he's so cool. He's so down to earth. And I think that's what makes him amazing, because coming from being a skate photographer, he's gone way past anything anyone has done. - Look, it's sticking more now. - Hey, what about Gino's part? Come on, you gotta take your hat off to him. Backside 360 mani down the Rosyln Banks? Jonze: I guess I was editing "Adaptation," and we doing all the skits for "Yeah Right!" Got Owen Wilson's number and asked him if he would do this thing. And I was like, "Well, you just come and you just gotta talk like as if you're a skater." And he's like, "Oh, yeah. Cool, okay." And so me and Ty wrote the script, and I faxed it. This is, like, pre-e-mail, I guess. He called me back, like, about three hours later. He's like, "Okay, I've been staring at this for three hours. There's no way. This is like -- This is like a foreign language. This is like learning Shakespeare. There's no way I can learn this by tomorrow." Feeble backside 180. Feeble shove, frontside. Come on, man! It's 2003! The next week, he came in, and he had learned this, like, two pages of what was basically gibberish to him. Don't forget Sylmar. Front salad, back salad, front blunt. - Bullshit. - Basically, I got two minutes of footie, but I'm not using any of it because it's already been done in "411" issue number 52. He'd never even seen a skate video. But he said after that, like, all these people came up to him and was like, "Dude, you skate?" - Oh, fuck! - Fuck, yeah! - Come on! Come on! - Yeah. - Fuck yeah, dude. Yeah. - Yeah, right. - Whoa! - Oh, man! Keith's board. Okay. And everyone talking, hanging out, and Eric! Spike is hands-down the coolest director. And Brian! [ John Frusciante's "Murderers" plays ] ** ** ** Evans: The first film I did with them was "Yeah Right!" You know, I was, like, this young kid coming on to help Girl with video stuff. And, like, I'd never even really been exposed to his world and the green boards and the green ramps and all that stuff. And, dude, that day he let me go, like, direct to second unit with, like, some guys doing a manual trick while he was doing something else. And that was the first time I was like, "Dude, this dude's trusting me to go do this. I have no idea what I'm doing right now, but I'm gonna go figure it out." ** - Ohh! - Oh! Jonze: You like that style? ** - Ohh! - Ohh! Jefferson: That was really rad, to be around him while he was filming those intros. And to see a director really direct, and see a director really work like a professional. With the 75, am I getting full-body, or is that gonna be too close? You back up till you're full body. Evans: You know, when those films came out, I think it was something different within skateboarding. You know, skate videos didn't really feel like that. ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** The "Fully Flared" intro definitely had a danger factor. [ Wagner's "Flight of the Valkyries" plays ] But Spike loves a little danger factor. It kind of started out with, like, big, you know, air compressors, like, blowing foam. Oh, it's no big deal. And then I feel like later in the day, a little more explosives kind of got integrated into some of the stuff. And then Cairo was kind of the first one when he 50-50's down a hubba and it, like, blows up all into his face. ** Mariano: Just blows him up. I mean, the guy's sitting on his knees, like, blinded. "Aah!" Like, we're like, "I'm not doing one. I'm not doing this." Hey, Marty. Can you blow it earlier, like, right before, right as he's coming down? Koston: The later, it's Lucas. Huge explosion. Like, Lucas come out. "I can't hear." Lucas got fucked up. He was, like, bleeding out of his face. ** Mike Mo, that was straight napalm, dude. Like, you could feel the heat from that 200 feet away. He did the switch flip, and then they blew the stairs. And I think he went deaf for a couple days. So that day was pretty, pretty nuts. [Laughs] ** All: Ohh! Koston: He'll kind of push the limits. And he gets out of it, always. He's like a cat, dude. This guy has some kind of magic about him where he can do some weird shit and not get in trouble. [ All cheering ] I remember being in Orange County, and we set two spots across the street on fire. You know, like a busy shopping center. And we're just there dumping gasoline on public property and lighting it on fire. And we're with Spike, and he's just like, "Yeah, dude. Gasoline." Let's drop it down." Ba-du-ba-dup. Anyone else would've gone to jail. I think he's made a career on pushing the boundaries of what's possible in film making, which is awesome. But in order to do that, you gotta keep people on their toes. [ Laughter ] Jonze: Wear the sombrero. Koston: I mean, I've seen him do so much sketchy shit. [Laughs] Like, grab a camera, bomb the hill, and just slam and obliterate a Bolex. Mullen: Spike would always take it a little further than he -- for the life of me -- I felt he had the control to handle. [ Laughing ] And he would manage to make it anyway. And that just says something about character. - Whoa! - Oh, yeah! Always seeking to push himself into uncomfortable places just for the sake of, "How does that feel?" Like, you're more alive somehow. Mariano: How long's it been since you ollied something that big? 10 years? Mullen: Of all the people I've known, and I've known some characters, no one better captures that doing things for the innocent sake of being alive, no one in memory for me captures that better than Spike. [ People cheering ] [ Laughter ] How'd that feel? It felt sketchy, but it felt good. What's next after the 3-flat-3 ollie? Triple set. Whoo! [ Laughter ] ** Tremaine: Spike's career was taking this sort of serious turn, like, he was becoming this legitimate director. And they didn't realize that he was this awesome sort of troublemaker, you know? And we were doing Big Brother and doing our own thing. And we started making videos to go along with the magazine. Yeah, I just happen to have them all. With the clever title, "Number two." I am Johnny Knoxville, United States of America. Oh! [ Coughing, spits ] And it's after we put that video out that I realize, "Holy shit. I think I can make a TV show out of this. I don't know what the TV show is, but I've got this exceptional group of assholes that we can make something cool out of." And so I first went and took that idea to Spike. And he's like, "Yes." And our first meeting was with HBO, these two women at HBO. And so you know, my -- I figured, look, I'm just gonna sit back. I'm the one that's gonna do -- I'll put it all together. But Spike's gonna be the one to legitimize it and sell it. And so, we quickly show the tape. Not too long! Aah! Aah! Oh, fucking hell! Aah! Oh! And then when it comes time to talk about it, Spike's just like, "Uh, uh..." Uh, yeah. It was really awkward, and the meeting started so nice. And then after the tape, it was just like they couldn't get us out of the room fast enough. And then the next window was MTV, and the exact opposite reaction. We didn't let Spike talk anymore. Now we're like, "All right. We're just -- agent talks, Knoxville talks. Sell that damn thing." [ Minutemen's "Corona" plays ] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! ** [ Laughter ] We had no idea that it was gonna become what it became. We really just thought we were making a skate video that we were getting paid to put on TV. ** Mariano: Spike is just such a crazy artist ahead of his time that sometimes I think, like, movies like "Adaptation" and "Being John Malkovich," they're just, like, really pieces of art. And you gotta have, like, a really open mind to watch something like that. And the funny thing is is that movies like "Jackass" that have gotten a guy kicked in the nuts have just been his blockbuster, all-time most highest rated things. And it's like -- I just find that funny because he does these beautiful art pieces, and everyone's like, "We like the guy you kicked in the nuts." Look at the stains on Pontius's Speedo. Oh, gross. Mariano: And I think that Spike likes that, too, because Spike probably deals in, like, Hollywood, he's got all these executives and suits and this and that, and it's just really stressful and hard to get something made with restrictions and all this stuff. He's just like, "Fuck this." Goes out with Tremaine and his old boys, like freestyle stuff, and just, like, do it guerrilla-style, and just made shit-tons of money. And it's just like a fuck-you to the studios. It's like, you know, "Listen to me. I know what I'm doing." Oh! And we cut! The thing that's cool about Spike is that it doesn't matter if he's directing, like, a $50 million feature or, like, a $0 feature. He's still gonna go out and approach it the same way. [ Barking ] I don't know. What do you think? I think we've got it. [ Laughter ] Evans: I think once you get to that level of dealing with multi-million-dollar projects, you wanna have some time off. You wanna get back to your roots. And I think that's what, like, his skate projects were. This is, like, what he does for fun. During the times "Where the Wild Things Are," like, he came out onto a Lakai skate trip with us. And I was nervous to see Spike. I didn't know who Spike was. He was big-producer Spike now. He could be some, like, arrogant just, like, Hollywood prick, you know? And come to find out Spike didn't change a bit. - Whoo! - How's it feeling? It's scary. And I shit you not -- Spike skated more on that trip than most of the pros. [ People cheering ] I think Spike is, you know, next to Tony Hawk, probably our most proudest success story of the skate community. Like, you couldn't ask for a better person to represent skating outside of skating. If that cop comes back, we're just filming a video. Evans: He has this young spirit to him that's fearless, that's fun. And that goes back to "Video Days," man. Grabbing a camera, going out, having fun with your friends. [ Minutemen's "Cohesion" plays ] ** Whoo! ** Jonze: I think skateboarding -- Skateboarding is, like, a part of me. It's, like -- it's shaped me. It, like, made -- It's why I'm here. I got into photography through skateboarding. I got into making videos through skateboarding. And skating, especially in the '80s when I was in high school, not only did nobody give a shit about skating, people aggressively hated you for it. So, like, we weren't making stuff for anyone's approval but our own. ** ** And I guess I look at it as, "Did I make something that gives me a feeling?" Like -- Like, I can watch Mark Gonzales' part in the Blind video and I mean, I credit Mark mostly. I'm just sort of lucky to be behind him on a skateboard with a camera. But that thing just gives me a feeling to this day. ** You know, that's what you're always kind of searching for, is, like, that buzz that, like, thing that gives that feeling that's like -- makes you stoked just to skateboard or stoked to have your friends or stoked to be alive. ** ** ** ** [ Crow caws ] [ Wind whistling ] [ Cawing continues ]
