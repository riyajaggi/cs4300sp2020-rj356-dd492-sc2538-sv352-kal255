 I don't know if it's gonna work, but I found this -- this scorpion. 'Cause what I want to do is get it out, and then maybe I could make it into a graphic. When -- Kids, when you do this at home, number one, stay off the drugs. Number two... you need to wear protective eyewear. 'Cause when you want your graphics to be cool, you know, you got to do some things. Jesus! I thought --

 I thought it would be, like, solid solid. Just kidding. Hot day for graphics. I feel like you look at Dill and you would go, "That guy's probably famous or something." It's the stinger. There's something about Dill that makes him unique just by looking at him. ** Dill always had that gift of not being on the board and then getting on it and then looking sketchy for a second and then doing the gnarliest thing. Dill came in, and he was like, "Dude, I'm tellin' you, this is my last few years on the board.

 You're gonna want to have it on film." ** He's just so alive and, like, showman and just fun to talk to and so excited and, like, that enthusiasm is infectious. Dill is a talker. "You see these fuckin' calves? I will fuckin' kick the shit out of you." He's just a fireball. You could tell his brain is just, like, "This point, this point, this point, this point. I got this to say. you see this? Blah, blah, blah. Man, I just seen this. This was cool. I was walking down the street, and I seen blah, blah, blah." I got eyes like a cat. I see everything. Dill could talk your ear off, but if you listen, you'll learn some good shit. Yeah, the joke is that you can just probably sit him down in a chair and go, like, "So..." and he'll take it from there. All right, so, Patrick, Aaron, how long you guys been doing this? Need to put your glasses down. I love ice cream. Henry, you're my main man. Trip out. Trip out. What's up? Welcome back to "Epicly Later'd." This new series is on television this time, and we've done tons of episodes. I c-- added them up once -- there's maybe 50 of them. And 2 of those 50 have been on Dill. What's up? He was somebody I wanted to revisit. So much has changed in his life. He lives in Los Angeles now. L.A.'s hectic, too, I guess. He runs a company called F.A. with Anthony Van Engelen. Real stylish skater. He's also known for his personality. He's kind of like a-a polarizing, controversial guy. The world's fucked right now, and everything's so fucked in America. White people are blowing it, and it's just... So, we are here at his house in West Hollywood. We're just gonna see what's up with him, so here we are with a Jason Dill episode. I was just a little white-trash kid. Like, that's just shitty. I had, like, just started, like, liking chicks and, like, smokin' cigarettes with my friends and being bad and listening to fuckin' "Master of Puppets" and drawing the cover and shit. ** When you, as a child, 8, 9 years old, come across a skill and people start patting you on the back for it, people start telling you, "You better keep doing that because you're really good at it," and you become obsessed with that one thing that you do, you're a weirdo now. ** For sure, like, you're -- you're different now. You're experiencing life differently 'cause you're putting in so many hours of practice into one, fixated thing while other kids are, you know, putting toy cars up their butt. You know what I'm saying? Like, you are... ** ...pattern. Skateboarding's all pattern, and it's over-repetition. Makes you fuckin' crazy. ** Right around, like, 9 or 10 -- no, 8 -- I found myself living across the street from Ed Templeton, and, um... they were skateboarding, and that went from there. Think about it. Like, it's crazy. I was seeing Ed Templeton and Jason Lee, and, like, they were older dudes, you know? Fuckin' jerkin' off and all that fuckin' shit. They were always talkin' about shit like that and, like, chicks and fuckin' this and that and, like -- I remember this one kid, Davis -- he was incredible, incredible skateboarder, and I remember, um, like, that age, and he's like, "Last night, I had sex with this girl on mushrooms, and her face was melting, and I was --" I was like, "Yes!" Like, it was just a sick education. It was so cool. And then that's when I started to go to contests, and I got, like, sponsored, sponsored, and that's when I really started to, like, realize that, like, "Fuck. I'm, like, an amateur skateboarder. I'm sponsored. This is really cool. I can, like, make something out of this." ** * I heard my master * Spoke with your master Being on 101 was, um... Yeah, it was definitely my first big-deal sponsor. It was fuckin' not as -- Not to take anything away from Black Label, but it was -- 101's a company that turned me pro. * There we are I've heard stories of maybe, stealing boards. I was 19 years old. 19 years old, I lived on my own, I took 36 boards from World and probably a bunch of other product. I sold it so I could pay my rent and shit. It's lame, whatever. It's -- I felt -- I felt like it was lame for they didn't -- they didn't pay me, and I needed dough, and then, at the same time, I took 36 boards, so I totally understand now, being older, like... I don't take it back, but... * To see if my master * Had a happy We would buy boards from Dill. One time, I tried to trade him dirt weed, saying it was, like, old good shit for some boards, and he was, like, "This shit's shit, but you can take those three boards for it. Whatever." ** By that time, like, "Trilogy" had come out. Like, I really was like, "Man, Dill's sick." Like, he was someone I looked up to and fuckin' ripped. He's always had flavor. He was, like, one of those dudes that, like, didn't have that much footage come up, but when he did, it was always sick. It was like he knew just to put out less but make it dope, you know? It would be like every 411. There'd be a gnarly trick in. Like, Dyrdek kept hitting him up about, like, riding for the Workshop. ** Alien Workshop is and was, you know, the smartest skateboard company ever. Like, I mean, it sounds silly saying that, but if you really think about it, actually, it was, the only serious skateboard company. The quest for the New World Order is, in part, a challenge to keep the dangers of disorder at bay. 1990, "Memory Screen" came out. It just shifted... my thinking. Everything I saw in that... This is the Alien Workshop. ...from the beginning with the jud-duh jud-duh jud-duh jud-duh jud-duh, "Quest for the New World Order," all that, when you're a kid and something comes across that you've never fuckin' even known about, and that -- that's coming in, there's nothing like that. And that's exactly what "Memory Screen" was. Just like if you were to watch a film at home, and you're like, "Fuck, man. That fucked me up." Skateboarding can do that to you. You can be watching it at fuckin' someone's video party, you're like... "My God! He didn't just fuckin' do that." And then, like, you see that cocksucker riding away, like, "Yeah, motherfucker, I did it." It's like murder. It's like legal murder sometimes, in a beautiful way. ** But there was just nothing like the Workshop. It just really was, like, in neon lights, just about the best company you could ride for. Those were, like, the best times of my life, those early Alien years. And, like, I felt like I finally was, like, a part of something that meant something, you know? 1998 to 2000, we made the "411 Industry Section"... ** ..."Feedback," and "Photosynthesis." ** Now, I'm not asking for a fuckin' award. I'm just fuckin' sayin' that's fuckin' gnarly. And you told me that "Feedback" was your -- was your, like, throwaways... No, I never said that. But you said -- Nothing I've ever put out's a fuckin' throwaway. Everything I've ever put out was hard for me to do. Okay. Wrong word. Um, when we were filming "Feedback," me and Anthony didn't think TransWorld videos were that good. I mean, come on. I'm sorry, Ty, but real quick, I love "Feedback," but that song fuckin' sucks to this day. What the fuck is that song? So, we had some Brian Eno song on the European release, then it comes out here, and it's, like, some fuckin'... * Take a ride on a... That fuckin' song sucks so bad, but the video part... is still okay. And the editing's great. That song I still can't get over, Ty. I'm sorry. I'm never gonna forgive anyone for that song. Now we've got ourself clear. I'm about to make this video pop. See, you got to love New York. Fuckin' free bagels. For sure, when he moved to New York, there was a whole New York Jason, for sure. You know? It all got put together right there. ** We're on Bowery right now, and, I used to live right here. 138. Shit. Okay. So it was... It's gone now. Ha! Just like everything. It's all -- Sorry, man. It's okay. It's fuckin' gone. ** Early New York, in -- as a teenager, I would basically have to... bite my tongue 'cause I was so excited by everything I was seeing. Everything I -- Everything I saw was like, "My God!" Like, it was just, like -- I was so... blown away. New York knocked me off my feet. I needed to be there more often, and then, once I was, you know, financially capable of being there and not being completely broke, there's nothing like being in your early 20s in New York City. Holy shit. This area's Tribeca. You know, it's, like, the most expensive neighborhood in the world. I lived here. Yep. But I had to live with a parrot named Walter. And he was a fuckin' asshole. Walter was such a dick. I hated Walter. He was the meanest parrot you ever could've met. ** I used to walk around these streets at such a young age, just flyin' high. You know what I mean? Like, didn't really think. I just... would get fucked up and just... I think, at that time, there was a lot of, like, partying and shit going on, and, like, meeting a lot of, like, different people even outside of skate and stuff, like -- I mean, he's always Dill, but, you know, Extra New York Party Dill. I think the scene at the time when I first moved here and Dill was here, I think that scene was just so fuckin' powerful, and it felt like, "Dang. There's a whole world out here that I didn't know," meeting all these different people that have nothing to do with skating, and we were just going out every single night and just having the be-- the best nights of our lives, really. There was like 30 of us at every party every night, like, you know. It was crazy. It was like a web of craziness. I would go stay at Dill's when they lived on Broadway and Canal, and I remember, one time, he had, like -- like board shorts and, like, penny loafers. And then he was just telling me, like, "I'm never doing cocaine again," like, "That shit's gross. I hate people that are doing cocaine," and literally five minutes later, comes out of -- out of the fuckin' bathroom, he's like, "I just snorted a bunch of coke." So he's wearing penny loafers and trunks, and I was just like, "Man, you are fucked." I'm abouts to do -- I'm abouts to do whatever the hell... I goddamn please. I don't remember if he said it or I said it, but someone was like, "Do you like to do drugs?" and I was like, "Yeah." And then, we went on this like 17-day bender. We just did whatever we wanted. ** And it's insane that we're alive. ** That time period, from 1998 to 2003, was just... mayhem. I took so much Valium on the flight here that it's taking its toll. Finally, money started coming in. It was like, "Holy shit!" It was like I'm buying a pair of Jordans every day, and I have my own bags of cocaine. It's not someone else's bag of cocaine I'm borrowing to go to the bathroom with. It's, like -- You know what I mean? Like, and then, like, you meet all these people who do not skateboard. Let's get crazy. Let's get nuts. Let's do it. That's why I like New York, and I like that shit where, like, you could be in the mix of something. You never really knew what everyone did. ** Yeah! I really liked that. I thought that was cool. It's a new era -- new era in skateboarding, and, I have to say it's a new era in life. ** Things, - Things have changed. See?! For me! For me! For me! We're on Canal Street, and we're coming up on, -- on Broadway. And that's -- that's where I lived for a long time. Like, on 9/11, I lived here. So, on 9/11, I woke up hearing my roommate say, "What do you mean a plane flew into the World Trade Center?" Like, 'cause he was on the phone. Our walls were super thin. And I just put my pants on. I was like, "I need to see it." But I thought -- I thought it'd be, like, a little plane. Pd-bd-bd-bd! Like, once I turned the corner, I saw both buildings on fire. The closer you would get walking down, you'd see people start walking toward you covered in white soot. From here, you -- at first, you thought it was just debris, like, falling, like -- And a lot was debris. But then, once you get close enough and you could, like -- it's like... You know, "My God. That's a man and a woman jumping." Like, he's wearing a blue suit and, like -- You could start to see, like, you know -- Like, it really, actually -- Hold on. Da da da da da da da da! Cha! My hero! I knew it was gonna happen. Thank you. That's right. I'm the best, totally. By the time that I walked back down and I ran into my roommate and my girlfriend, you know, that's when... He was like, "Turn around," like, just... That was that. We didn't do that photo to, like... out of disrespect or anything like that. It was... I mean, it was a f-- I mean -- I mean, that's -- it was -- it was so insane. You know what I mean? I -- You know, I don't really -- I don't know. I don't talk about this shit too much, 'cause it's, like, it's real fucked up, man. Real life, TV. You'll never see something so psycho. You know what I mean? Like... you hope not to. What's happening with your video part, buddy? I'm gonna tell you this one more time. I want this video part so bad. I want it to be so good. Now, you -- you call me more often than not not sure what day of the week it is. Connor, it is Friday the 10th. I'm just telling you, Dill, my observations, and I'm worried about you. I know, Connor, but it's not -- I think it's -- I think it's more me being more, flamboyantly, extravagantly... I don't know. Maybe I am that fucked up. Skateboarding needs personality, and you need dudes like him, you know? Everything that I like about skateboarding, he's, like, fit that. You know what I mean? There was something about him that was magnetizing for me, at least, and I think a lot of other people, too. I think when his "Photosynthesis" part came on, I think everyone was like, "Dude, this part is fuckin' sick." Whoa! Filming for "Photosynthesis" with Bill was the best. It was so great, because "Photosynthesis" just happened. We would just go out and skate, and we'd get tricks or we wouldn't. And then, at night, we'd go get fucked up. It was great. There was no, "You need a last trick," or, like, "You need another line, or..." None of that. It all just came together. It wasn't, like, a job, really. We'd just be out, like, having fun all the time, and then it'd be like, "Dude, deadline's in two months," or, like, "Dude, we got to get it together." Like, "Let's go out skating." I'd be like, "All right." He would just try shit and get it done. I knew I wasn't gonna make a better video part, and that's tough when you're in your early 20s and you, you know, you don't want to... ** ...peak, you know, too soon. ** "Photosynthesis" was the last video that j-- it just came out, and it didn't feel like work. Everything else after that felt like a lot of work. ** Fuck off. My time on the board was getting further apart. Tricks landed and film. ** It was the beginning of the worst of the worst. Tempo, cruise kibble, cruise kibble, cruise kibble. Pbht! ** He would show up on trips, and I could tell, like, he'd just ain't been skatin', partyin'. 20 bucks to open the restaurant to get me cigarettes. I'll give you 50 bucks, you o-- It's -- It's closed. 50 bucks. But then, like, he'd be a few days in the trip, and he's fuckin' rippin'. ** You know, and he's gettin' shit, and you're just like, "What the fuck?" Like, "I've never seen you do that trick." ** I'm not ashamed of "Mindfield," but I most certainly got by on the skin of my teeth for that part. And I really owe Greg Hunt an apology for just being so... I mean, I would say "Mindfield" was probably a challenging time for Dill. He was still kind of, like, drinking a lot and stuff, so he wasn't, I would say, like, in tip-top shape. Whoo! You're alive? Yeah, yeah! A-fuckin'-gain! A-fuckin'-gain! He would kind of not skate for a while, and then he would come on a trip and try to skate, and he would sometimes get hurt. ** Like, his wrist. I think he broke his wrist a couple times. Yeah, I was a mess during "Mindfield." I was a fuckin' mess. It's still good, though. That's the thing about Jason. It's, like, it's still out of that video, like, one of the parts that I would watch -- You know what I mean? -- and that I like, so he has that, you know, whether his effort level is at 20% or 100%, you know? People want to see it. Between 2006 and '09, I probably developed my worst drug addiction. Yeah, what kind of drugs are we talking about? I'd smoke speed, I'd smoke crack, I'd take pills, I'd do whatever you got. But the main thing that would keep me kind of, like, buzzin' throughout my days was -- was Vicodin, Percocets mixed with booze and... ** It would get larger in quantity as you went on, and the years would go on, you'd do more and all that bullshit. ** You know, I wasn't talking to him very much, and, um... He, had that morning where he woke up fuckin' throwing up blood and shit. Um, it was Jameson and Vicodin, and, - that caused a hole in my belly. And I woke up one morning, and I threw up blood everywhere. And I ended up at a New York downtown hospital for a bit, and they were like, "You had a gastric hemorrhage. Your insides kind of look like a 60-year-old bum's. You got to cut the shit out. You're gonna die." ** He ended up in L.A., and I was living in Venice at the time. And then he stayed in this, like, weird motel in Santa Monica, and I'd pick him up. Man, he looked like shit. He was, like, fuckin' grayish yellow. He wasn't good, you know? And... Whatever. Long story short, ended up staying with me for a year and gettin' his shit together and skatin' a lot. We ate, slept, breathed skateboarding. That's all we did. We'd come home, watch videos, fall asleep on the couch, like, get up, go skate. We skated every single day for like a year. That's when he really got his shit together, you know? Like, of all the times I've spent with Dill, that was the most epic of times, and it was rad. 2013 came flying in. And, I... quit... Alien Workshop after 15 years to do F.A. Dill's told me even before, he's just like, "If it all ended today, I'd be happy. 'Cause you know why? We did it." Whoa! Whoo! ** I think it was in London, and I was drunk in the back of a taxi cab. And I was with my now partner, Mikey Piscitelli. And, um, I said, "I want to make a clothing company. I want to call it Fucking Awesome." And he was like, "Wow. That's dumb." And I was like, "Yep." And then he went back to America, and I remember calling him from a pay phone. And I was like, "What are you doing?" He's like, "I'm trying to make this logo for you." ** From 2000 to 2005, we were making shirts pretty sporadically. And, I mean, small amounts -- like, 300 of something. And, only selling it to Supreme in New York and in Japan. I'd say the first three rounds of shirts, they were all printed by us in our apartment. But 2005, we had, like, a big spike in popularity in that streetwear world, and it got a little too big where it wasn't manageable between everything else we had going on, so we just didn't do anything for a year when I think most people would've jumped at that. Doing it that way allowed us to not fall into any trends or die, and because we never did it as a source of income, it stayed pure where we were able to do whatever we wanted, to the point when Dill and Ave decided that they were gonna leave Workshop. Dill was like, "I want to turn F.A. into a board company." Yeah! There you go! At that time, we were just so sick of, across the board, with s-skate companies. Like, everything got so fuckin' soft and watered down because there was so much money, and everything got built up and, like, you know, there was these huge infrastructures for these companies that, you know, "We have to make product that sells to fucking zoomies, 'cause we have to." We want that stuff we came from, and we still thought that there was skaters out there that weren't jocks and, like, were attracted to skateboarding for the same fuckin' reasons we were and needed that. Skateboarding... sold itself to the mall. You just can't contain a whole culture of a thing inside of your Spencer's Gifts. We already had an idea of team riders, and, like, it was all right there. But it was a gnarly idea of leaving the Workshop after 14, 15 years. There was definitely a time... when I was like, "Guys, I don't know. I'm fuckin' scared." ** And Bill and Anthony stayed on me. They really, really stayed on me. ** We quit May 1, 2013. Um, no bullshit, man. It was... That was gnarly. It was sad. That was so hard for him, and I think that also added to the fear of everything, like, "I'm leaving this place that I've always been, and I'm gonna do my own thing," which is awesome, but then, with that, there was a lot of weight that I think he felt he had to carry on his own. ** Yeah, he was crazy for a while. ** Stuff. Stuff. Stuff. It's all a mess. Believe it or not, this is all unused material. All -- Most all of it's been scanned, but... F.A. graphics -- like, everything that ends up being something for sale comes from here. Like, it comes from this area. I just like anything that's physical. I like -- I like that you can cut things and, like, rearrange them. At least the idea's there. He got a very clear idea of what he thought was cool in skateboarding. And the clearer that idea got, the more fixated he got on separating himself from everyone else. B-Basically, what I mean is, he's got a clear understanding for what he thinks is cool and what he thinks sucks. And right now, in skateboarding, what he thinks is cool is it's the most popular things out, you know? So I think that his genius was on par for the timing of where popular culture's at and where skateboarding's at. One big thing I really enjoy about owning my own company, I no longer have to answer the question of, "What do you do for a living," with, "I'm a professional skateboarder." 'Cause it just sounds like -- I might as well say, like, "I'm a fuckin' professional pogo stick." You know? Now I can be like, "I'm a company owner." "Really? Well, is -- is -- is it a lucrative business?" "Well, yeah, Poindexter, actually, it is. I'm doing fuckin' pretty good owning a skateboard company." But you know what I mean? I no longer have to be, like, "Pro skateboarder, blah, blah, blah," and then people are like, "Are you on ESPN? Do you do the X Games?" It's, "No. No. No." "Do you know Tony Hawk?" Ding! "I do." And that's the one que-- You know, like, "I -- I -- I know Tony. Yeah, he's a good guy. I love Tony Hawk." ** Why did they turn her pro? Why wouldn't you turn her pro? Look at this picture. You wouldn't -- You wouldn't turn this pro? Um, I-I just want to show it, this, because if anyone's ever seen one of these episodes that Patrick's done with me before, I never had a kitchen that looked like this. That episode begins with, like, a blood spit on the wall. Yeah. Did you fix your teeth? Yeah. For the most part, I mean... We're looking at about $18,000 later. ** Even back then, when he was in New York, he would always have stuff hanging up in his apartments and stuff, like, photos that he had cut together, little collages, just random gnarly Polaroids of somebody all bloody or, like, him naked, weird stuff just hanging up all over. And the F.A. graphics look a lot like the stuff he just had hanging up in his apartment. ** There's a whole room in my house I won't let you see, 'cause it all looks like this. No one goes in there. It's just me. I basically accumulated my own thrift store back there. So -- Why can't we go in? It's too much. It's too crazy right now, because I def-- I feel so good about how together I now appear compared to when I was on this thing when I was younger. It's funny. If you make everything at home, you're stuck at home, and you're making everything within your patterns -- all your views and all your weird opinions and everything to you that you're making to show the general public whatever point of view this is or this has, whatever this says. But you know everybody's gonna be judging it, and it's like, I fuckin' judge every fuckin' skateboard company when they fuck up. I think a lot of people in the industry make my job easy. But then it's -- it's not easy. It's tough. If I don't make the boards, there's no boards. If I don't make the shirts, there's no shirts. You have to come up with an idea every day, kind of. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I've done it from a month-by-month basis. I'm only doing whatever I'm doing in the moment that feels right, like, whether it be doing ads a certain way or making a video come out a certain way or doing -- I can only base it on -- on right now. ** Dill's got an eye for what's good, and he won't let anyone else do it, you know? So he's the one that's just sitting there doing it. That's what keeps him in the mix. But he's, you know, constantly looking at everything, like, "Like, I see what Kevin's doing." Like, I'll want to kind of try to incorporate somethin' like that for his graphic, you know? Everybody tells me all the time, like, F.A. has the best graphics, and it's -- I don't even put stickers on my boards. You see? If you can't tell. I always was like, "Damn, I'm gonna get my first pro graphic tattooed on my arm right here. And then, my first pro graphic was a fuckin' picture of my face as a child, and I was like, "I'm not about to get that." They're all great, man. Like, Nakel's? Kevin Bradley's. Kush Cowboy has got his weed diploma. Sage's. Look at this. Original Chlo board. Why did you wanna give her a board? Because Chloe fuckin' rules. She just is great. Like, Chloe's just the best. She's just, you know... It's like that Stevie Nicks super sick, like, you can't put your finger on it, but it's the fuckin' business. You're a pro skater? I know. I am a pro skater. I have a pro deck. I have to thank him for, like keeping me relevant, in a way, with the young kids, you know? I'm pretty grateful that he did that, you know? Aah! Whoa. I remember skating this board. It was so good. Like, I got, like, a lot of good clips on this board that I really liked. This is... the only board that I skated. It's one of my favorite boards. This is a painting. It's not a photo. And it's so insane. Dylan's kid picture. I used to have the painting of this. I wanted to do a board that's really special for Dylan when... he got sick, and, um... And so I got with this artist, Delphin, who's really great, and, um, I said, "I want modern Dylan close on a child Dylan." We got photos from Dylan's mom, and, I said, "Let's do this one," and put it on, like, a leather jacket with a button-up shirt, and he did it, and it came out really great. Dylan was so fuckin' special. Just one of the greatest ever. [ Cat Power's "Metal Heart" plays ] * Losing the star without a sky * ** * Losing the reasons why We put him on Alien when he was young, so he was on Alien with us. * You're losing the calling that you've been faking * As we went along, like, Dylan would come to New York and, like, visit me and, like, hang out, Bill, and he kind of became... kind of known, you know? Like, coming out to New York and just kickin' ass. ** * It's damned if you don't, and it's damned if you do * * Be true, 'cause they'll lock you up in a sad, sad zoo * ** My God! That shit was insane to watch in person, man. He just, like -- just a level up so hard. ** It's like the best of the best. * Metal heart, you're not hiding * The response after Dylan passed away was, like -- It was, um... It was really, really beautiful. It was just, like... I'm so glad that we were able to do what we were able to do with Dylan, the amount of time that he was alive. I mean, I got to go on so many fuckin' tours with him. I got to see, like, him, like, blossom. I remember when he had no tattoos, and, you know, all that shit, like, all that stuff that -- that you, like, see someone going from, like a kid into a man and all that stuff, you know? So I really appreciate that. It's great. His ashes are right there. Like, I have some of his ashes, and Bill has some, and... Yeah, no, his mom gave them to us, and I keep that little picture there and the little -- I love that picture of me and Dylan. ** But, yeah, Super Dylan. He's the best. Dill's contribution to skateboarding is reminding people that it's skateboarding and you can do whatever the fuck you want. So, we're supposed to meet Jason Dill here, and he got arrested on the way here for, a joint. "Got arrested. I'll be there by 12:30 or 1:00." I thought getting arrested takes longer than that. We're passing by the Bowery Mission, whatever that is, and he didn't get a chance to tell me what that was, 'cause the police came up out of nowhere. He wasn't even smoking 'cause he was telling me about all this shit, like -- So the shit had went out already. So he's like, "Yeah, blah, blah, blah." Next thing you know, police came and grabbed him. Free Dill. He locked up. I didn't even get a chance to hit it like that, like... That's not why I'm bummed. I mean, it sucks that Dill's locked up, but he'll get out. The joint is gone, for sure. That shit's never coming back. Free the joint, really. The cool thing about Fucking Awesome and seeing sort of it as being this kind of little personal thing that Dill did for so long and now what it is, this huge board company with this massive team, and I think more than anything, it stokes me out to see that he has such a solid group of young kids on his team who he really, like, loves and respects. ** Whoa! A lot of these kids have known each other for a long time. They've known Dill for a long time. And now these kids are just so good. And now they're influencing a whole generation. It's really cool to see what it's become. ** Hey, Free Dill! Free Dill! Fuckin' cops, man! The fuckin' cops, man. Yeah. Like, of anything to get fuckin' bagged for. It's such bullshit, man. Just like... Sorry. It was just like -- I'm sorry to be so late. How about -- How about this for a shot? I love these guys. These guys are my best friends. When I got the chance to do the video for Supreme, "Cherry," I was so psyched. Just like, kind of like, felt like the time. Like, I felt the energy, and no one knew the footage I had. So I was kind of just trying to tell Dill, like, "Dude, you're gonna -- you gotta do something with these kids right now." I'm like, "Just trust me." Respect the youth. Youth are getting restless. Ba dum bum. I've always called them my kids because, people kind of refer to them -- They be like, "I seen your kids, I seen your kids." Like, I used to give Sage Alien Workshop, like, you know, a lot of them would get boards from me. And then, you know, you got to understand, when -- when they were filming "Cherry," Tyshawn was 13. I think a lot of people in the skateboarding industry thought I was fuckin' trippin'. Look at him now. You know what I mean? Like, no one can touch them. They're the fuckin' best. ** Dill's really good with people, and, like -- and he's been through a ton of shit, so -- And a lot of these kids, too, like, they're -- they're going through shit, so he has that type of relationship with them, too. You know, you drop out of school, smoke the pot, take the acid, go pro one day. How about that? America. I don't know about the acid, but... This is America! Get used to it, white people! Fuck you! He'll also get on their ass about shit, too. I have a word to say to you, too. Jesus. You better behave these days. If you do some shit that he don't like, he gonna say how he feel. Period. I -- You got to respect that. Dill is very passionate. And that's what happens when you have passion. You know, a lot of people in the industry are just fake as fuck. He's someone that they look up to. He's not perfect, and he doesn't claim to be. Well... maybe claims to be a little bit. But at the same time, he's such a, like, good person to be learning from 'cause he's been through it. My -- Like, all the time, man. Father-- No. He say that shit, but that nigga ain't my father. My father name is Tyshawn Jones. That ain't my father. That's -- That's my big homey. That ain't my dad. The best one is when I was skating with Alex Olson, and I was, like, arguing with this guy who had parked his car in the way, and I was like, "Yo, get out of here." But little did I know that by doing that, I was making the whole process just take longer, you know? So word got back to Dill that I was being annoying on the session, and Dill was like, "When you go skate with those dudes, you're a fucking ghost! You sit in the corner, and you fuckin' watch!" Like, hell, yeah. All right. What was filming -- Good skate etiquette, though. I feel it. Dill is so dramatic. Yeah. Dill's a drama queen. You got to like -- He's a master of theater. Dill showed me more of the art in the other stuff around skateboarding and even the art in skateboarding, like, telling me things like nobody should ever have bad flat ground. Like, if you have bad flat ground, you're a trash skater. ** I-I always say, like, I love them all so much, and altogether, they make my favorite skater. You know what I mean? - Whoo! - Yeah! I'm at awe of it all the time. Like, I can't believe this. This is so cool to see them go from where they are to now. It's like... you couldn't ask for anything cooler than that. I'm so proud of them. They're the new pros. And, I couldn't be fucking happier with, like, who they are, what they are, what this is, what we've done. It's fucking great! ** What I really like now is how they'll go to different countries on tours for shoe companies that they have contracts with, whatever, and they'll stay for like another month and shit. I'm like... that's what I did! And, like, just, like, eating in nice restaurants where they never thought they were gonna eat at and just getting high all around the planet and just landing it and ripping and living. That's all I wanted out of this whole shit. ** Everything that happened outside of my drug use, I wanted these kids to experience the professional skateboarding experience that I got to experience, which was psycho and beautiful and scary and dangerous and... I don't understand how I made it to be sitting in this chair now, 'cause it was really fucking insane. ** ** **
