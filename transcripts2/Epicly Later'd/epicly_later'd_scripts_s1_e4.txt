 O'Dell: Can you show us your -- some of your tattoos? Yeah. Do you have one on your ass? Oh, fuck! Priya, don't stare at my butt. [ Laughs ] [ Humming fanfare ] I got this one. This one's my fucking favorite. And it's my own fingers. It's my own fucking fingers. You know what I mean? And then one -- Wait, hang on. Let me get a shot of it.

 Like, hold it -- hold still for a second. What does it say? It says "Fuck cops." I fucking hate the law, 'cause they fucking make you have no fun, man. I want to do what the fuck I want. When someone tells you don't -- what you can't, I'm gonna do it more. I do whatever the fuck I want. Pssh, pssh! Carnie: A lot of skateboarders are boring. They don't want to talk. They're scared that the fucking cool kids on the playground are gonna make fun of 'em. Andy does not have any of those filters.

 He's unlikely any other human being, let alone a skateboarder. [ Cheers and applause ] He's got it all. He skateboards, he gets people hype, he's lovable, he's a monster, he's every single thing you want in a human. Burnett: Andy's just like a mad dog. Like, "Yah, yah, yah, yah! Yah!" And when you hear him talk... Fuck off! Aah! Burnett: ...and you see him move, like, it goes hand in hand, you know? Carnie: He has the most hyper style. I mean, he just skates fucking weird, but in a good way. Like, it works for some reason. I don't know why. Aah! With him, it's just his energy. Uh, uh, uh, uh! Stranger: I have as much fun watching the guy get slammed as I do watching him make tricks, 'cause he's got, like, the funnest bail ever. Burnquist: I mean, he's just such a rad dude, and he has the nicest personality, man. And then all of a sudden, he starts punching you, and you get into fights in the van, and you're just like, "What's going on?" He would start fights really easily. Stranger: Definitely felt like he had way more bark than he deserved to have in such a scrawny, little body. Phelps: He's just a true skate rat. Sometimes, he really even impresses me. Burnett: Even though he can seem really funny and entertaining sometimes, there's some rough stuff in there that kind of gives him a lot more depth. ** Andy: Hey, dude. Hey, dude. Man: Good life at 3:00 in the morning. [ Laughs ] O'Dell: Welcome back to "Epicly Later'd." We're meeting up with Andy Roy. Yeah. Andy Roy always seemed like a spazzy, kind of frightening character in skateboarding. There you go. Andy kind of represents a gritty, grimier side of skating where it was more about a way of living -- no change of clothes, no nothing, just skate and travel. Was kind of early on known as a Santa Cruz/Consolidated rider. Eventually linked up with Antihero, but not long after that just pretty much dropped off the face of the Earth -- drugs, prison, all kinds of weird, sketchy robberies. I don't know. I just really want to get to the bottom of Andy Roy. Andy: You can just jump on your skateboard and fucking book it and go and do what what you want. I want to do my own shit, you know what I mean? I like to just run free. It takes, like, a fucking hour these days to get warmed up, man. I know how to call, sext, porno, and that's it. I can't even goggle. I don't even know how to do that. I got A.D.D. where... I get frustrated. I see one little thing, and if it doesn't happen right there, I-I'm over it. I want to move on. Man: Leave a message. That's why I owe IRS and everything else, you know what I mean? Like... I cannot keep track of responsibilities. It's real hard, man. I just want to skate and just hang out, you know what I mean? That overweighs any responsibility by far. I wouldn't shoot you, dude. You're my homey. O'Dell: Are you ready? Where are you from originally? I-I say I'm from Santa Cruz. Actually, that's where I-I -- my skating, everything started, but, uh -- but I grew up in Modesto. This is the shit that I've been hiding my whole life. Hiding? Hiding Modesto, and it sucks and fuck. You're just embarrassed? Yeah, I -- we're there, you know what I mean, like, some little shit hole. It's, like, some hillbillies, they got, like, less teeth than I do, and I got, like, seven left. I say I'm from fucking Santa Cruz. ** It is fucking miserable out here. Connie: It's warm, huh? It was 106 for 4 days in a row this last week. [ Laughs ] That's true. I love my mom, you know? That's my mom right there. She was pregnant with me. This is her graduation photo. I'm that bastard-child shit, you know, with no dad. Whatever. My mom's cool. She took care of me. It was just she was a single mom and fucking working jobs and bartending, you know, so she couldn't keep her eye on me all the time. I could just go run amok. Come over here, honey. Yep, Dad, you're in here. He's trying to weasel out. [ Both laugh ] I was trying. But she remarried to Duane Roy, which is my stepdad, and I love him very much. Connie: And we've been married 31 years. Yep, 31 years. To you? Mm-hmm. Thanks. My mom and dad, they party. They knew how to party. Been there, done that. [ Chuckles ] Mom. They called her "Party Girl." [ Both laugh ] She got hit with a shovel. My mom used to cause her trouble, so I think that's where I got it. O'Dell: So, how was, uh, Andy as a little boy? [ Both laugh ] Lots of energy. Like this dog. [ Laughter ] He gets all excited. ** O'Dell: Were you a hyper little kid? Andy: Yeah, I was a fucking maniac, man. The teacher would fucking yell at me and stuff and, uh, I -- I was just, like, I couldn't sit down. I don't know. I just wanted to keep moving and, uh -- Yeah, I got a lot of fucking energy, man. He was getting crazy in class, trying to make everybody laugh. He used to like to show his butt to everybody. He was so daring. [ Chuckling ] He would try anything. But he was like that with everything he did. ** And this is her doll room, right, Mom? This is your -- They're all in the back. Yeah, this is my doll room and my sewing room. I didn't have dolls when I was young, so... What's your favorite one, Mom? My favorite? Well, her. Yeah, Sugar Britches. And we went into Margaritaville, and I carried her, and everybody thought she was real. [ Both laugh ] I have all his skateboards and his magazines that he's in. These are, like, I think, a little older, right, Mom? I think those are your newest ones. But, uh -- The sperm one is older. Yeah. [ Laughs ] And I think he still owes me a couple that -- Yeah, I -- and the latest ones. I heard about the latest one. Am I getting one of those? Do you want one of those? It's... Well, I wouldn't want to borrow all your boards, but -- Yeah. Uh, it's from this guy right here. You weren't thinking about your son at all on that. Uh, he'll understand as he gets -- No, he won't understand. Kids make fun of kids when they're that age. He's only 7. They -- They won't see that. They -- You don't know that. Kids are on the computers now all the time. Kids are cruel to each other. I know, I would fly out there personally... Yeah, well... ...and stick up for him. You didn't think of him at all when you did that. I never met my real dad. I didn't have much, uh, people looking out for me. My mom always made sure I had cool shit. Like, I'm not putting her down like that. She was single, so there was a few different dudes that she hung out. One dude would put hands on me when I was young, you know, and she -- wherever she was -- She'd bring different dudes home, and I acted -- hear shit going on in the room at night, you know? That fucks with you. And then, or if I -- Hey, whatever, I go in there, and you see a fucking mound of blow, and then... A bunch of dudes just, like, you know, and her fucking high, like, I -- that's what I seen, man. My mom stopped and got good, and she's doing great now, but that's just what I fucking seen. Yeah, and then later on, it fucking caught up to me. It was in my blood, man. It was fucking bound to happen. Uh... she told me, "When we fucked around as kids, we did drugs, but we didn't fuck with heroin," you know? They knew that was the devil's drug. I didn't know that. I fucking just -- Whatever. Fucking luck of the draw. I got fucked with that bullshit. Hey, I'm hanging out surfing. Like, it's, like, cool. Like, I'm at the beach and shit. Check it out -- There's, like, naked girls everywhere. I'm a surfer. I'm -- I fucking surf now. We got some doo-doo, some cocka-poopoo, and we're gonna make a bridge right now to get to Buena Vista Pool. Ah! Aah! I'm good. Let's go! ** Look, there it is! There it is. All right. Andy. Hey, Andy. Every day for six months, I would come here after school. I would try and get in there and skate, and the older dudes would spit on me, run me over, and told me to get the fuck on out, that, "You're in the way." So, I'd wait till everyone left, and I would skate it in the dark. Andy knew what he wanted to be from when he was a fucking grommet. "No, Mom, I don't want a baseball glove. I don't want a fucking soccer ball. I want some new fucking wheels. I want to go skate fucking Buena." That's what makes Andy what he is today -- a true skateboarder. ** They had a contest at Buena Vista Pool. Like, anyone could enter, and I ended up winning. This dude, Steve Keenan, was, like, team manager for Santa Cruz Skateboards, and he was, like, "Dude, give me a call tomorrow. You can come in and get some free gear, put you on the float team or whatever." And it was cool, 'cause I lived in Santa Cruz, and then you ride for Santa Cruz. It was sick. ** Salba was on the team, Eric Dressen. It was just neat 'cause it was legendary. I worked for Santa Cruz, I think, for, like, six years. It was rad, but then, um, street skating hit and baggy clothes and rap music was started happening. Punk is out, rap is in. And then they're, like, "Hey, man, you're not getting the photos. You're gonna have to wear, uh, all baggy pants and have an all-street-skating part." So, then that Thrasher video way back in the day, I'm with Simon Woodstock. As a joke, he took me to Ross Dress for Less, and we went and got a bunch of baggy clothes, and we went street skating, and it was the clown, fucking Santa Cruz, 'cause they kicked me off because I didn't fit to their fucking deal, or I was being mean to other riders, and they would quit. - [ Laughs ] - All right, see you, buddy. I was dressed like this, so they didn't bust me. They did him! [ Laughs ] See what happens when you wear the good stuff? O'Dell: So, you got kicked off Santa Cruz 'cause you weren't doing pressure flips. How did Consolidated come into the picture? It was, like, Jason Jessee was, like, one of the main dudes there, and I looked up to him. When he fucking hit skateboarding and I caught visuals of him in magazines, I was, like, "That dude's a badass motherfucker." And he was a fucking maniac, you know? Come to me, and kiss me. Andy: That's a dude, when I see him skate, you want to punch a motherfucker in the face. Like, he gets me that excited. I fed off his energy. "Oh, my God. Andy's here." Like, "We're really gonna have a session now." ** He kicks it up where you just want to light your face on fire. Whoo! Andy: Jason and those guys asked me if I wanted to ride for 'em. Of course, I said "yes." And we had a rad time. We're Consolidated. Young man: This is the Consolidated tour. Andy Roy didn't do nothing this time. ** Andy: We got voted Most Stable Team in Thrasher. We were solid. O'Dell: And what happened with Consolidated? I was doing an interview for Big Brother. We got inside this van in front of Consolidated, and all of a sudden, the slider door opens up, and it's Jesse Paez, and he's fucking in tears. He's all, "Dude, I just got kicked off." We're, like, "Wait. What?" So, yeah. "'Cause I'm gonna have a kid, and they think I'm not gonna skate." Hell, no. Me and Karma went in there, fucking destroyed everything -- ripped off the boards. Like, you gonna kick fucking Jesse Paez... that was my exit, right? See ya! I'm out. Jessee: He's so loyal. You know, Andy's an amazing human. And you never want to be on his bad side, and so many people have been. Andy: This is Derby Skate Park. Sick. Yeah, what's up, guys? Is anyone in there? - No. - Dude! It's good? All right, sick. Oh, fuck, yeah, dude. Hey, you got a Consolidated hat. Yeah. How come? Yeah. But Jason Jessee left, dude. That -- It's done. That -- Jason Jessee -- that was Jason Jessee's company. Birdo sucks, dude. What? What do you mean, "What?" Dude, he never did -- He could barely grind Derby. Jason Jessee made that shit happen. I rode for them forever, and he fucking kicked Jesse Paez off and we all left, and that was -- went downhill. Birdo sucks. Birdo sucks? You better believe it. What are you doing? What do you mean what am I doing? I'm speaking my mind. What are you doing? I just don't get it, man. Everybody's in town right now working on the 25-year anniversary video. Of what? Consolidated? Consolidated, yeah. Where's Jason Jessee? What? You're serious! They're suck, dude! They suck. What's the big deal? Man. You -- don't get bummed. That's just life, dude. Trick hurts, huh? Geez. [ Chuckles ] Hey, don't be sad, dude! It's Go Skateboarding Day! Oh, shit! God damn it! Well, I'm gonna skate today! He got me. Kooks. Hello. Hello. It's a nice day today. It's beautiful. Are you guys having fun? Can I get a high five? O'Dell: All right. Yeah, that was a good one! Tershay: Yeah, Andy has a good heart. You know, it's just that he's one of those people that if he don't like you, then he'll never like you. Oh, he's coming back for more. Here we go. Are we fighting or what are we doing? Yeah, sure. Yeah, is that what we're doing? Sure. How you want to do it? Whatever, let's go. Huh? Let's go. I'm ready. Exactly -- huh? I'm ready. Is that what you want to do? Fuck, yeah. He asked me a question, and I spoke my mind. That's cool. Yeah. I told him we ride for Jason Jessee. Good for you. Good for you. That's why we did. And I said Consolidated sucks. That's what I said. I'm here. I'm here. Yeah, and what, dude? What are you gonna do? What? What are you gonna do? Well, I mean, you wanted to talk to him. Here he is. Huh? Let's settle it. Get out of my face, dude. I came here to skate. Oh, you don't want to? You just want to talk shit? What are you doing? Yeah, I can talk shit. I can do whatever I want. I can talk shit. Okay. Get out -- Do whatever you got to do, Birdo. Do whatever you got to do. You guys came here, huh? I mean, do what you got to do. What -- What you wanted to tell him. I want you to -- I mean, I just -- I told it. Fuck Consolidated. I'm not -- I'm not just gonna jump you if you don't want to throw down. I'm -- I came here to fucking skateboard. Why did you start shit? I spoke my mind. I didn't go say -- You know what? Fuck you, dude. Fuck you, fuck Consolidated, and that's exactly what I said. They fucking kicked Jesse off for no fucking reason, and that's what I said. And all we -- We kicked -- We kicked Jason Jessee off? Jesse Paez. Jesse fucking Paez. What? And -- Did you guys not? No. He didn't get kicked off? No. Bullshit. Bullshit. Keenan -- Keenan let him go. There you go. "Let him go." "Let him go." Right? Kicked him off. He's trying to fill you in what happened. Uh, I was there! I was fucking there! He came out crying, 'cause he just had a fucking kid, and you guys kicked him off. I was fucking there! I was there. Right on. Fuck Consolidated. How 'bout that? O'Dell: Let's just go. Yeah, I want to get the fuck out of here. You just want to talk shit -- baseless shit? What? I can say whatever the fuck I want! Big deal. All of it together was just, like, a fucking tornado. That's what I felt. Like we left everything a fucking mess everywhere we went. Man: Oh, my God. See, when I came here, man, from Santa Cruz to here... She's all changed, man. Fucking weird. Straight up, man, speaking of being part of a skate time that's, like, gone, I think we all are in a sense, you know? Like, I've so few friends left from that era -- from the '90s era -- I really enjoyed skated with, so the ones that are left are, like, hang on to you, you know, 'cause those connections, they're hard to come by. ** Thiebaud: San Francisco in, like, the early '90s was, like, this hotbed of progression where I think it finally sunk into all the skater's heads that we -- they -- could do anything they fucking wanted. ** And I think Andy came into San Francisco at that time and was in a group of skateboarders who were just finding spots in the city every day. They would just get on their skateboards and push and go and wherever the hills took them, that was their day. They had just enough money to make rent, skate all day, and buy beer at night. ** We had the fucking most terminal crew of rip-ride dudes. ** Cardiel: We were friends and, like, brothers. All of us were just animals, just, like... feeding on skating. It was just, like, fucking raw -- Get it. ** Everybody skated together every day, but then everybody got sponsored by different people. Julien and John wanted to, like, "We want to have a team with our honeys. Let's bring it back and hang out with our friends and put everybody on the same team kind of," you know? ** Andy: Julien's a badass motherfucker, dude, and if you're gonna do something, I want to be with the fucking gnarliest of the gnarliest. Me and Andy, our skate styles are so completely different, but it's pretty funny that we ended up being really good skate friends. Just probably really got cemented somewhere in the '90s. Andy: At that time, I was hanging out with Cardiel, Julien a lot. I was, like, "I want to be part of this shit." It's the baddest fucking company on the planet. No matter what anyone says, Antihero is the fucking truest thing out there, period. You know, Julien's mom was an artist, so I think he -- he also has that angle of, like, it doesn't need to be, like, a regular skate company. It can be something different. Carnie: I don't know. Antihero to me is, like, the way they just handled themselves. Especially in our culture today, there's a lot of me, me, me, me, me. Antihero does not give a fuck about that. They're not look for attention. They want to just fucking hang out in the kitchen and throw up all over the fucking floor all night long. That's the best video, man. Fucking "Fucktards" video is so good. - I promise. - Whoo-hoo-hoo! Andy: Fuck yeah! "Raaa!" right? And that fucking looked like the -- That literally was like a Hollywood movie. And it went straight out. Bzzzp! I was, like, "Dude, I want to do that, too," so "Raaa!" And then he would go "Raaa!" Oh! Andy: And then we were going back and forth. Like, he had a little bit more on me. I was running out of juice. Fucking Andy, he started gagging himself, and I was just, like, "Man, he always take it to that extra inning." I will add that I did get kicked out of that apartment the next morning. That's about it. [ Laughs ] Andy: Julien would always look out for me. They were going to Texas, and Julien's like, "You want to go?" I was, like, "Fuck, yeah, let's do this." I had a Consolidated shirt on, I had a Consolidated board, and that's all I fucking had. I got to change my shirt at some time, right? It's gonna get dirty, and I knew they had, like, some T-shirts in there with that fucking eagle. That eagle, man. So, I tried to wear my board out so I could fucking ask them for a board. So, it happened and I got a green shirt with that fucking eagle and I put that fucker on and I fucking put that Antihero skateboard with the eagle, too, on... It was the gnarliest fucking feeling, man. It was, like... Ugh! Dude, Cardiel, Julien, like, it's fucking on, motherfuckers! ** [ Cheers and applause ] And that shit right there was in my life forever. ** ** [ All shout ] O'Dell: That phase of Antihero, you had the video with the cow, but you -- That was my last video that I was in, yeah. So, you started disappearing. What was some of -- what started to lead to you not being around Antihero anymore? Uh... Fucking, um... I guess he was doing some other stuff that eventually wound up him being a guest of the State. [ Birds chirping ] Oh, boy. Here, uh... Put it on top. Yeah, so, this is gonna be random. When we were growing up, Reuben would always party with us, but he never, like, got into the full fucking gnarliness of it all. So, he was just smart enough to always bring a camera around. Yeah, it was funny. We always said that I was gonna make a book of Andy, you know? We were always kidding around about it. Crazy. I had teeth still. There's -- Brand-new teeth. Hung over. See, everyone had to be so fucking tough in Santa Cruz. Like, these were, like, the dudes I fucking -- like, just what -- what's their deal, dude? You know what I mean? "I'm hard." Fuck yeah, sick. "What are you doing?" "Nothing," I said downtown, trying to beat people up. Fuck, Santa Cruz. Andy: I come back from skateboard trips, you know, I go back to Santa Cruz. I had some surfer friends that I grew up with that we drink, you know, smoke weed, and then now they're fucking smoking crack, you know? I'm, like, I'll get drunk and [inhales sharply] whatever. I ran with that one for a minute. But I would come back and tell John and Julien, like, "Man, I smoked some crack and this and that," and they're, like, "Rad, dude, you did it, and you came back, got out of it," you know? They're like, "That's good," you know? Whatever. "You can do it and split." Well, as you get deeper into it, that shit will snatch it up. I had broken my foot, and I was out for, like, six months, so I just started hanging out in Santa Cruz. And this dude was smoking that heroin, and that was, like, the beginning of the end of my skate life. It was my fault, but this is the dude that brought it around, motherfucker. Fucking heroin -- I don't wish it on my worst enemy. It fucking took everything from me. I'm in Santa Cruz, right? And Jason Jessee calls me, and he's, like, "Hey, man, Jay Adams moved here. He's looking for you. He wants to hang out with you." I'm, like, "Wait. He's looking for me?" We skated, and from that day on, we were glued to the fucking hip. We were brothers. Jessee: As far as I'm concerned, Jay Adams is the inventor of skateboarding. He started everything that we love. Andy: He was skateboarding. These dudes were the ones, when there was no fucking waves, they would get on the sidewalk and they had to imitate surfing. He was just, like, a fucking ball of energy. He was like a little kid, man. I was, like, "Dude, I like this dude. This is, like, right up my alley." Jessee: It's Jay Adams and Andy Roy. You knew they were gonna get along good. He's the perfect psychopath, and they were doing bad shit. Tershay: Jay's fucking crazy. You know, they were doing hella drugs like heroin and shit. Jay Adams turned him on to, like, booting drugs. Booting means "intravenous." Andy: He stayed at my house, man, and -- and he was in the bathroom, and he was, like, "Andy, come here!" I was, like, "Huh?" I went in there and he was all, "Let me see your arm!" I'm like, "Huh?" And he's all "pssh, pssh!" Bam! And it's just that fucking high. It's like you're on top of the world. But you got to remember -- Anything that makes you feel good -- alcohol, whatever it is -- There's a price to pay. Shooting heroin in my neck. I'd jump up on the counter, and I would look off the reflection of the mirror and just... jab the thing in my neck and -- Miserable. It -- I-it happened to me, man. I don't -- I had fucking skating. I had the best friends. I had the fucking -- [ Growls ] Yeah. Yeah, there was some years where -- where he was just, like, in and out. Well, I mean, like, at one point, we were just, like, "What's up with Andy? Why doesn't he --" You know, we'd call and try to engage with him, and he would just blow us off. Julien and the guys would try to call me. I'd avoid the calls. But how are you supposed to tell your best friend, like, "Hey, I'm a fucking heroin addict, dude," like -- I-I just didn't know... what to do, man, and I just got deeper and deeper involved in it. I lived with John up in Sacramento, and Andy called us up, and he needed a place to live. We were, like, "Come home. We got you." But he was still too fucked up, but he wanted to get clean, and he came up and brought his backpack and I think he lasted, like, two days, and then he was gone -- like, left his backpack behind on the coach and was -- and then just disappeared for another couple years. Thiebaud: When you see someone dealing with drug addiction and what it takes from what they could've had, it's a fucking bummer, you know? And seeing that happen to Andy sucked, you know? O'Dell: So, how did you end up in jail? Um... From fucking doing drugs, man. Like, robbing and stealing and kicking doors in. I started hanging out with these dudes, and they would go to the dudes that were selling drugs, they'd kick the fucking door in, they'd tie him up, and take the shit. Bad shit happened, man, and I was just a skateboarder. But now I'm hanging out with these fucking dudes that have been in and out of prison. At first, I was getting, like, petty thefts. You know, that's, like, just stealing. After, like, the -- the third, fourth one, they'll start giving you a year. I get out, go back in, get out, you know? All of a sudden, 10 years went by. This is what you get like when you're locked up. Bigger you get -- I was a fucking pit bull. What was different about the last time you got out? Uh, you're allowed magazines, you know, so I'd be looking at Thrasher magazines, and I'd be seeing John and Julien skating doing exactly what we were doing before I got locked up, and I'm fucking over it, man. I'm a fucking skateboarder. I'm not some fucking junkie. Fuck that. I don't want to go out like a fucking junkie. I want back in. I'm fucking over being a caged animal. I want to fucking skateboard. ** How was it to get those kind of calls when Andy was getting in a little bit of trouble? Was it -- Was that a hard thing for you guys? Oh, yeah. In jail again. Yeah, we didn't like it. It broke their heart, you know what I mean? Yeah. It cost us a lot of money. [ Laughs ] Look, man, like... my mom worked hard. They tried to look out for me, you know, and then, like, s-s-she raised me right. Yeah. When I got on drugs, that was just the people I picked. That was on me. That had nothing to do with my mom and dad, because they -- they raised me comp-- You know, they -- they partied, yeah, maybe I -- I-I seen some things that they did, but I just so happened to pick wrong people and a bad choice of friends. And it had nothing to do with my mom and dad, and that's what I want you guys to know. Like, that was on me, and, uh... It's tough. Yeah. I mean, to see your only son in jail... and then worried he's gonna... be beaten up or... worse and... Yeah, it wasn't easy. Yeah, but that -- that's -- Life happens, you know, and all you can do is learn from it and -- But th-they -- It takes a little time, you know, but... O'Dell: How do you guys feel about how he's doing now? He's doing -- seems to be doing well and -- Yeah, but... h-he needs to make a living, and he's got a son and... he needs to take care of him. Scrambling, yeah. There ain't -- I only know skating, like, you know? It's hard to -- t-the way I look or whatever to get a job and -- You don't look for jobs, though. I just don't want to do the 9, you know? I just -- I need -- I -- W-W-- that's a whole 'nother thing, but I -- H-Hopefully everything will work out, man. It'll -- It -- I'll make it happen. They were saying that Mic-E would bust you stealing boards or -- I got away with it more than he caught me, though. Let's just get that straight out of the gate right now. O'Dell: Oh, let me get one shot of you up in your bed, like you're waking up. It's not much bigger than a prison cell in here, right? No, this is exact -- and then you're on the dou-- you're on the double bunk. This is... pretty much your cell. But I -- I get to go outside of it and I get to leave and come back, and I can go a little further than, like, the prison yard, so I'm good. I got out of prison, and I met this girl. I ended up getting married, and I fucking had a kid. Give Dad's teeth back! Thank you! And I moved to Modesto, and I did this family life -- I didn't drink, do nothing. I started doing these lessons and stuff. So, we just do a camp and have fun. And what boards do we ride? What boards? Antihero! That's right. He was doing skate camps. He had, like, a minivan, and, like, you know, take 'em to skate parks, and, well, everybody loved him. What do we do? Skate fast? Aggressive? Spill blood. Let's get it, dude. Brenes: And at first, I guess, you know, the moms and the dads were a little bit skeptical just 'cause of the way he looked and everything. Don't make me give you a beatdown, dude! But then he's all good. They're all, you know, like, "You're so good with kids," and everything. Dude, kids fucking love him, 'cause he's a good listener, and he really talks to them with his heart. Andy: This is what skating's all about, right here. I know you can do it. Jessee: He gives them this confidence that maybe they don't get at home. See? That was easy! Dude, you just did something you didn't want to do. That was sketchy. Come here! And that confidence, they'll never forget. Cardiel: You see him with, like, young kids skating, like, he's rad with it. Fuck, he's a fucking -- yeah. I mean, I don't want to good guy it up too tough, 'cause he's fucking gnarly. Fucking just like everybody else. You got fucking good and bad, so -- Andy: I was doing a skateboard camp. It fell apart. Willie! And money become an issue, like it does with anybody. It's fucking hard, and, uh... I got a divorce. I didn't know what to fucking do. I-I called Julien. He needed to get a job, man. The guy needed some discipline in his life, straight up. So, I was, like, "All right, Andy, got you, man." You bring your shipping manager into your office, and you close the door, and you're, like, "Look, I need a favor. There's this guy. I don't think you've met him. I need to get him a job. Can you fucking work with me here?" You give Andy Roy a chance. Andy: They gave me a job, and I just figuring out how to sort of ship, where you, uh, you weigh it and send it out? I did it, man. I did it for a year and a half. Oh, this is just random shit A-Andy would do to express himself, by writing on the walls. "DLX dungeon slaves." "Fuck you." Andy Roy had kind of, like, a -- a reputation for being a character. He would do crazy shit. He would take off his, uh, his clothes, and he'd get up on a cart, and this other dude would push him around, and he'd tuck his shit in between his legs and, you know, like the guy in Buffalo Bill, "Silence of the Lambs" scene? And he would just sit there and pose in all his glory and stuff. Andy Roy was not a good employee, period. It's not a good testament to me as a manager to have people quit because Andy Roy works here. O'Dell: Is he a tough dude to sometimes have to vouch for to go, like, "Oh, well, hire him here," or...? Yeah, but I'm pretty good about not taking responsibility for him. Like, he -- he does a good job of letting it be known that he's his own asshole. They were saying that Mic-E busted you maybe stealing boards or... I was broke, man. I was trying to fucking eat. Wasn't like I was buying a car, a Ferrari or something. I was just trying to fucking eat and survive. Mic-E Reyes worked at Deluxe, and he -- he's, like, the muscle there. He was a fucking ex-cop, which I fucking hate cops, so he would try and catch me. Mic-E knew all of Andy's hiding places. He would love to show me Andy was fucking up, so he would take me into a corner of the warehouse and be, like, "There's 19 boards here that he's been storing, Jim, that he's gonna try and figure out how to get out of this warehouse." And I was just, like, "Fuck, dude. Seriously?" Andy: So, then, uh, Jim and Mic-E are heading to their office, and then they're, like, "Hey, Andy, come in here." And the whole fucking office had all the boards laid out. Please, dude, like, you cannot steal from Deluxe. He rides for the company, he works for the company, and he steals from the company. And then he high fives me every day. [ Laughs ] Dude, I can't. But Jim was so fucking rad. He was just, like, "W-What the fuck? Like, really?" I'm all, "I'm a hoarder." I'm all, "I like the boards. I collect 'em." Does Andy strike you as a collector? I -- I think that anything he was taking back there was not, like, for a board on the wall. [ Chuckles ] This is everything I collect, the skateboard stuff, um... Like, I want to start a museum, and I got all these boards. Uh, Jim, Julien, you guys at Deluxe, if you ever need a-a board to look at if you don't have one, I-I-I've got it for you guys. I-I'll -- I'll look it up on my roller dex thing and show you guys. ** Thiebaud: I realize I can't take the good that Andy brings and then, like, not take the bad, as well. Like, look, this is from -- Look -- This was when rode for Santa Cruz. This was custom. Jim Thiebaud, look at that, buddy, Jim. What's up? That's right. O'Dell: Why does he get so many chances with you guys? It's so tough, dude. Why does Andy get so many chances? It's so tough. Um... I give him chances in hopes that he will take responsibility, because if he does that, then I think what Andy brings is so fucking special to skateboarding that it's worth a third or fourth or fifth chance, you know? And I don't want to give up on that. T.M.O. gets fired up, then Andy gets fired up, and then the whole motherfucking 18 crew gets fired up. [ Panting ] I need a little breather. Yeah, I feel like I'm gonna throw up. [ Laughs ] [ Retching ] You can be ugly, broke, but if you can make a girl laugh, the fucking panties will fly r-r-right off their body. No. [ Laughs ] I-I won't -- I won't. I promise. Oh, God. No, just give me a kiss. Holy fuck. Aah! Man: Whoa! Oh, I got her. She knew I was gonna do that. O'Dell: Let me get a shot of you guys together. Take that cigarette out. That's cancer right there. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Khosla: I feel like people just think that he's, like, some fucking psycho dude, and, like, there's that part of him, but there's also, like, the sweet, like, nice Andy. When we're at home, he'll do, like, crossword puzzles in, like, In Touch magazine and, like, put his glasses on, and we just chill. He's really sensitive. He's a sensitive shell collector. That's what he always says. You know, you can't be the most punk dude. It doesn't last forever. I mean, I know some really tough people, but... Andy ain't one of them. ** Rogers: He's tight, like, with this Potrero deal. I mean, this is a cool scene down there. Right on. Get some, man. He's, like, one of the ringleaders, man. He's what -- what you hear when you go there. He's screaming. Oh! Fucking get it! Pushing people and, "Fucking do it! Do it!" ** Burnett: He's -- he's living it, you know? He's in there. He's regulating. Andy just lives and breathes skateboarding. ** Let's fucking get some, dude! Let's fucking do this! Fuck it. Oh, you go before me... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. ...since you're fucking grinding -- 'Cause you can dredge it, right? Yeah, yeah, I should be able to figure it out. Okay. Yeah, I was not sure what I was getting myself into at first when I moved in with Andy, but, uh... he is a fucking pretty high-energy person, but I mean, I was fucking 20 when I moved in there, so, I mean, I fucking had all the energy in the world. Sometimes when you meet your heroes or whatever, you can be disappointed, I guess, but, like, I was stoked. He was -- seemed just as fired us as fucking 20 years ago or whatever it was when I was watching footage of it, you know? Fuck! He made it, too, huh? God damn it. People only see the craziness and the fucking wild side of him, but he is fucking totally normal, dude. We hang out and watch movies and fucking, you know, just kick it. I roll in, then you got it, right? ** Man: Yeah! [ Cheers and applause ] That's my fucking buddy right there. I love that motherfucker forever. Whatever he's doing, he is fucking doing it 100%, and whether it's fucking doing drugs and causing a ruckus or skateboarding and hanging out with kids and stoking people the fuck out, it's 100%. So, luckily, we got him back to our side, and he's fucking skating and killing it, man. [ Cheers and applause ] You know, Andy's lived through at least three generations of skateboarding. You know, people come and go. Thank God Andy hasn't. It's super rad for him to get the notoriety he's getting now on, like, "King of the Road" and -- and bigger stages, you know? On your mark... get set... go! [ All cheer ] You guys ready to fucking battle? You just need that raw enthusiasm, you know? Boo! Aah! Burnett: The real magic is in just letting Andy be Andy. Get it! Burnett: Fuck, man, that's the most natural kind of talent you can have. Aah! Check! Got that motherfucker! I don't think he's there yelling because it's, like, a jock thing, like, "You get it. Lift more weight. Get it! Get it! Get it!" Get it! I think he understands that when you make a trick that you've been trying forever or that you're in one of those sessions that you know is special with your friends... - Whoa! - Yep. ...he knows that those are the things you're gonna remember for the rest of your life, so I think calling him a hype man is a full disservice. He puts his body on this line so that you will make the trick that you've been trying so you'l have the memory. Tershay: I think he's starting to get some, like, love again. Hopefully he'll be smarter and embrace it better. But I think he has a better head on his shoulders. [ Laughs ] Alalalala! But he will always be a punk. Aah! O'Dell: Does he have a board out? He -- no, not right now. Andy's on time-out right now. He pulled some dumb shit -- Shit in his own backyard. Burnett: I think even people that help him out have felt the sting of Andy Roy from time to time. And I don't even think that that makes him, like, a bad person. I just think if you want to fuck around with Andy Roy, like, you're gonna have to expect some of this stuff a little bit. Andy: I-I know I'm a pest. I'm irresponsible as just a fucking loose cannon or something, or maybe I'm just fucking cuckoo, but as you get older, you mellow out. A-All the shit I've been through, I-I shouldn't even be living. Every morning I wake up breathing, I'm very happy. You know what I mean? I-I'm very thankful. I -- there's still a lot more I want to do, man. It's a trip. I mean, look at this. Fucking beautiful. See? Sick. Look at the fucking rainbow! Rainbow! Trip out. Hey, that's romantic! That's romantic! Isn't it?! You guys should kiss! Kiss! ** Good times.
