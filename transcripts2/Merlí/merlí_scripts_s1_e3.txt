Says I complain to teachers. This is Gerard's. It fell from the clothesline. The neighbor leaves the stairs. The boy does not use a preacher, because it says it leaves mark. As if someone were see your underwear. I can not see the phase time of adolescence is over. Soon! Excuse me. You came complain about my classes? No, I came to congratulate you. Excuse me. Hello? I'm listening. No, I don't want to give in. Talk to his lawyer and lie. to get what I want. All right, we'll talk later. Excuse me. Yes, you are a great teacher. I thought it was a fucking idea. that thing of the erotic poem. "Mind if I say that?" - No, no. At home lately, things suck. Too many mistakes, a bad environment. As puzzle pieces that don't fit. What a bad metaphor. Gerard was very ill, and his classes encouraged him. "Though it's just Philosophy. - As? I mean, it's not that important. the other matters. It isn't Mathematics or Literature. It's more important which Mathematics and Literature. Yes! And in Music, playing the flute is essential. Excuse me. Got upset? - No. "I did not mean it. Philosophy is important, I would not say it isn't. Life, death, God. "Man is the measure of all things. "Heraclitus. Protagoras. True true. One of the small ones. This this. - Small? - Yes, the children. - Those who came before Socrates. - Pre-Socratics. Yes Yes. It turns out that Protagoras he was not one of the little ones. He was a sophist. But, you're not in a hurry? I irritated him. "No, ma'am. Remember, I came to congratulate you. Gerard is enjoying his classes, and I love seeing him happy. And thank you for that. I hope it stays that way. I don't know how to do it any other way. I'm going to be late for work. See you, Merlí. See you. Like the rich and powerful Where are they? Are they smarter? More beautiful? No. None of that. Machiavelli would simply say, who are more devilish. If you want to succeed in life, step on others. You will succeed. in an undeserving way, But this isn't a problem, as long as you get where you want. That is, no matter who rules, but how do you do it. Exact. Very well. What do you think, Gerard? Does the end justify the means? Well, I think ... I Think... it depends on the end. Right? Berta, do the ends justify the means? How will I know? You think I do this kind of questioning? You're right. It's me who asks. Yes, speak, Joan. I was looking at the study plan. and does not include that subject. And we miss other themes. Joan, my friend. Damn it! It's always the same story. We have a teacher very good and very fun who does what he wants. We will follow the study plan, Don't worry. But my way. I like to quote other thinkers, although they aren't included. So, take your study plan and as there is no paper in the bathroom, you can use it to clean your butt. See, look. - Hi how are you? - Yeah, that's fine. In between. Good Morning. Well, I brought a new student. Her name is Monica de Villamore. Did I say it right? Yes? Very well. It will start today. Let's go. Good luck. Hello Monica. You can sit down. Good... - Clean the drool! - Very well. - I think I'm going to fall in love. - In The Prince,  Machiavelli believes that power of the state is above all else. To the extent that, in an extreme situation, government can resort to cruelty and fraud in a legitimate manner. What do you think? Monica? Don't know. The state is strong above the law to defend himself. In addition, why should of our lives without limitations? It is an excellent reflection. Dude, I already fell in love! Which is! A room for Merlí! I start thinking that he is the director's darling. None of this. He volunteered to help students who have difficulty in Philosophy. It will only be four hours a week. I've been teaching here for many years. and I never had an hour in a private room. What are you saying? He's the head teacher. We split the room. What are you complaining about? Merlí has ​​a privilege which I don't have. When students have doubts, we solve after class or should they go to the room department as usual. After what he did in the literary contest, now this? And you did not mention the confusion which he created between Albert and Laia. What happened? Laia and Merlí are together. He stole Albert's girlfriend. - My God. "That's a private matter. Toni, I know that Merlí can be talented, but give him a room? Talented? Talented? What talent are we talking about? Someone explain to me, please. It is talent to lead students to walk around the school Talent is shown in the classroom. I like it, but it seems that you forgive everything in it. No. I have been firm with him. since it arrived. But I can not rebuke a teacher who wants to help the students. They should prepare to help students who need it! - In the same room Merlí uses. "Toni, I'm not paid for it. That does not seem like a bad idea. But, in the end, I dedicate more time to students than to my children. Mireia, that's not a bad idea. Right. We will do this. - Great. - We'll do it. How are classes going with Ivan? Well, we are reviewing a little of everything. He has not spoken in weeks. Does he talk to you? He only gestures or writes. It's something. The same with me. And I repeat for him to look for a psychologist. But he does not want to. It would not help. You can not force it. I work all day in a bar. It isn't that Ivan does not leave the house, but he is obsessed by the Internet. He spends all day reading newspapers, or blogs ... - He reads newspapers? "Yes. And I don't think it's bad. But it's a little sick. He wants to know about everything. Before closing, he did it. I have a strange son. Yes. And in addition, he leaves the house a mess. If the house displeases you, No need to come. No. I don't care about the house. I don't care. And I don't care about the lessons. But I want him to have conditions to leave home. I know he has a principle of agoraphobia, but there is still time. We'll see. You need to trust Ivan. And he needs to notice that. I will pay for classes which he has given so far. No. I'd rather be paid. at the end of the month. No problem. I'll drop by before I go to the bar. and I'll clean it up a bit. No. Don't do that. He must do this. Will not make it. Leave it to me. Don't clean anything. Right? You are the only one who helps me. You like the new student, don't you? Your father went crazy with her. Don't worry. You're still his favorite. Marc Vilaseca. A five point two! Joan, your notes have fallen too much lately. - What happened? - Don't know. Let's go. Make an effort. You can do better. "A six?" What is your problem? - Leave me alone. Pol Rubio, Bruno Bergeron, Thank you for participating. Fucking four? A three point six. That guy catches my foot more and more. I thought you'd get a better grade. Is there a problem, little Bergeron? Question two is perfect. I wrote what is in the book. And gave me half the note. You took four. There isn'thing to discuss. What the fuck. Learned this type of impertinence at home? It's better to study more for the next race, - that will be in three days. - What? As? Three days? "Why another test in three days?" - On the last two issues. Anyone who is on the job, you will not have problems. Damn Hitler. - Fuck you! Pol and Bruno, want to be expeled from the class? What is Hitler's problem? with you? It was his target. It's because of my father! Two teachers take my foot, the fat Santi and Hitler. No. Santi does not get on his foot. Does not grab? He gives me a low grade. when you understand. And Eugeni, too. He can not stand my father. and cash in on me. - It's envy. Merlí is much better. - IT IS. Much better. If we fail the test, in the final evaluation. What a pity. It's too bad for me, man. I find it hard to memorize things. I simply can not. "I don't remember, Bruno!" I can not! "Why don't you study with me?" It works for you, study with others? - With Tania. We study. - Yes. And between the lessons ... We're friends. Well, if you're not up for it, don't go. No, no. Go to your house I'ts very interesting. - IT IS? "I've never been to a teacher's house." See you. A four in Catalan. - Damn it! Congratulations! "Eugeni is catching my foot. Here you come with this talk. Don't tell me about it. He grabs my foot, because I am your son. He will give another proof in three days, and I will reprove. Damn it! I've never been disapproving. Talk to him. Do something. Talk to him? But who do you think you are? You should do two things. Study for the next test and accept that Eugeni is mediocre. Give it to me! Give it here. I think Eugeni never fucks, man. I'm serious. If he fucks, we would all pass. What do you think, Gery? - Approves. "What proof?" "You're interested in a girl." - Her name is Monica, right? He was not in love with Judith, of the fourth year? "Yeah, it looked like she was getting married." - No, damn it! All right? I want Monica de Villamore. This is super clear. Well, there she is. And she has beautiful breasts. - I already know. - Go talk to her! Are you crazy, man? What am I going to say? Listen. - Go there and introduce yourself. - Of course. No fear, man. Attack. Shut up, Joan. He never introduced himself to a girl. Dude, it's your chance. If not now ... Come on! Come on, come on. - Come on, come on! Go, go. - It's all right. See, see. "Hello, how are you? Do you want to go to my house? I want to show you something. " Hello. Whether it's class times or ... No need, thank you. I got it. It's not hot, with that blouse? No? I'm not well. "Too bad, too bad. - No, man. Champion! How was it? She said We'll talk later. "In, help him." Do you know. - Me? I have not been very well. Go ask for Merlí's advice, right?

And point! It's ok. I'm the most beautiful guy. of the world. Right? The others already underestimate us a lot. Let's do this, too? From now on, let's think that we are worth a lot. It's ok? "Merlí sent you an incentive." - What? I had doubts in Philosophy and went to look for him. And during the conversation I told about the confusion of their separation. "But what are you saying, son?"

It's Lady Macbeth. "Lady what?" - Lady Macbeth. Shakespeare, son! Lady Macbeth. Because I was young. - "I've already ... - There she goes. and I know how ineffable it is to love the child that my milk suckles. But the moment he looked at me, laughing the breast would take him away of the toothless mouth and his head would break, if I had sworn, as you would have, in regard to this! " Police? Talent. Machiavelli says things as they really are. That strength is strength, violence is violence, and the lie is the lie. And there's no reason to disguise anything. with beautiful ideals. What you mean with "there is no reason to dissemble anything"? Machiavelli definitely defends the evil to save the state. Tell me, Gerard. There is something that does not fit. Why it is important to save a state able to harm its citizens? Is it worth saving? If the end justifies the means, What justifies the end? This is the most intelligent reflection that I've heard from a student. Gery! Very well. You're the greatest! Hi. Hello. - I like what you said in class. - Same? Because if you don't understand Machiavelli from the beginning, It gets hard. - Like to read? - Yes, a lot. And what do you read? Well, The Poem of Mine Cid.  - This is mandatory in Spanish. - Yeah. But I really like it. Listen, do you know this book? The Steppe Wolf.  Wow, that sounds pretty good. It's very beautiful indeed. If you want, I can lend it. - Yes? Oh, great. "And you can tell me if you like it." It's ok. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Merly, she liked me. Monica spoke to me and lent me this book. I'm glad. We will see if you cheer up a little, because the other day I was depressed with his mother's bid. Yeah, I know. - Does she work? - Yes. At CosmoCaixa. - Oh yes? - Yes. I love science. Take care! - Thank you! - "Thank you"? Thanks for what? You do favors for others, but nothing to me. Did you talk to Eugeni? No, and don't insist. Eugeni provokes me more hives than tourists. I have to be screwed. You make enemies. between the teachers, and they reproach me. You see how it was not Good idea to have you here? How not a good idea. have you at home! - Bruno! - Damn it! What a fright, Tania! "How was it with Pol?" - Good. And shut your mouth, before you hear it. Don't be mad at me. I only want the best for you. IT IS? Does not appear. Between you and my father ... Isn't true! "Be careful with Pol. He's not like you." "Don't imitate me. "Don't imitate me." It's ok. Pol always showed What do you like girls? but in fact, He is in love with you. I am convinced that you will live A beautiful love story. Is that better, my friend? Are you happier? Can you explain to me what criteria did you use to reprove Bruno? He did not have the knowledge for the test. Yes. Listen, Eugeni, don't reality is the question that which teachers usually imply with some of the students. You and I can involve together. Yes, but this should not have nothing to do with Bruno. It's ok? What love you are, Merlí. I like it, because it recognizes that there is teachers who can face it. Some physically hit him, others reprove your child. So admit who reproached him unjustly? No. Not at all. I don't ask Bruno. He failed. Simple. Tell little Bergeron to study more for the next test after tomorrow. - Hello. - Hello. Did you see Eugeni? Just left. Well, I'll leave the copies. of the Catalan test here. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hello. - Hello. Don't have private lessons? Yes. I'm leaving. Take it. A copy of the Catalan test that Bruno will do the day after tomorrow. - Saw? You could do something. "I'm here with Bruno." If you fail because it's my fault, he threatens to go to his mother's house. He's annoying and talking bullshit. He would not. All combined. I just spoke to Mom. "I'm going to Rome and maybe stay there." - What the hell. You can not go now! No? Mom is already shopping. the passage for tomorrow. You have proof! Besides, your father ... No! No! Let it go, let it. I'm tired of you. You're stuck in a giant hormone that does not let you think right! "Do you want to go to Rome?" - Yes! So, I don't see you! Go and stop bothering me! The janitor said that the mother of a student the third party is waiting for you. Thanks. Don't thank me. I'm doing a favor for the janitor, not for you. - Albert, please. "I would not even have come near you." Albert, I know I made a mistake. and I understand that you are upset, but you don't have to treat me like shit. - Say that in English. - As? You know how I look when we are having sex And you speak English in my ear. Say in English. Don't talk to me like that. At least not here. You would have liked me to say so. I'm doing like Merlí.

"Have you been working here long?" - Five years. You say you always come here? Yes. I brought Bruno, my son. Now he doesn't want to come. "They don't want our company now. - Right. Well ... Listen, Gerard is very smart. He is? And shows interest in my classes. That says a lot about him. On the other hand, the mother finds that Philosophy is of little importance, no? Yes. Well, I'm sorry. But I wish you luck. Need to go. No, no, I have an break now. If you want, we can have coffee. There's a little terrace... I'm sorry. I have an appointment. Am sorry. No, I have to go. We will see each other again. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. "So, Gertrude? How is Hamlet? " "Crazy!
