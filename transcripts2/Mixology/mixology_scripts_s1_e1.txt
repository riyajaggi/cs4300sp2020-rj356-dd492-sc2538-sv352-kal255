 Come on, dude. You've been out of the game for what, a decade? Girls have changed, man. They will sleep with anything. I get laid all the time, and I'm disgusting... head to toe. - This is true. He is disgusting. - Mm-hmm. "Sex and the City" changed the game, my friend. - Yep. - They're all Mirandas. No, Miranda was the workaholic. Samantha was the slutty one. No, no. Dorothy was the workaholic one. Nope. There was no Dorothy, dude. I'm sorry. There was a Miranda, Dorothy, Rachel, and Phoebe. That's the cast of "Friends." What are you talking about? You're just naming all the people from that show. No, I'm not. I'm just gonna get a cab. It's been... Oh, no, you won't. no you won't. Hey. hey, relax.

 You need to do this, Tommy, all right? Don't worry about it. We're gonna find you a nice, sweet girl. Yes, let's find you a nice, sweet, drunk girl. You know, the kind that breaks a heel. That's the kind of girl that you need. All right. CAL: Hey, what about red dress? Nope. She could bench-press Tom. I'm so sorry. Mom was late, and the kids were total maniacs going down. [Sighs] Awesome. I'm the oldest chick in here by a decade. Ugh, I feel like Helen Mirren. [Laughs] So, tell me. why did you want to meet up tonight? - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Okay, so I'm meeting a guy here tonight, - for the first time. - Okay. - His name is Ron. - Nice. And he is amazing. But I did meet him online, so there is a 1% chance he could be a serial killer. Oh, I need a drink. [Sighs] I need like nine drinks. - Oh, this is... uh, excuse me? KACEY: - Yes. Um, I, uh, will have whatever the hell my sister's having. Mojito. ♪♪♪ - Hey. - Hey. I have something really important to tell you, but I don't want you to freak out, okay? [Sighing] Okay, here I go. We're over. - Okay. - It's not you. It's me. It's just I'm a really positive person, and you're like this black cloud of negativity that rains poison on everything and murders it. Okay. Plus, I'm looking for something a little more long-term, and you're, like, really old, so how would that even work? Would you wheel our kids around in your electric scooter? - I'm 34 years old. - Ugh. I know. Anyway, I really hope we can still stay friends. Yeah, sure. That'd be great. [Gasps] Oh, my God. That's so great. [Smacks behind] You have an amazing shift. Yeah, you, too. Dude, this waitress is hot. Kind of want to eat off her butt. Ooh, hey. What about purple dress? TOM: - No. CAL: - Why not? Because she's wearing flats, dude. Girls who wear flats are never trying to get laid. I've told you guys this a thousand times... The higher the heels, the looser she feels. Okay. Ooh, okay, look. Brunette... black dress. - Where? - At the bar. TOM: - Oh, wow, dude. BRUCE: - Mm-hmm. She's so pretty. Oh, yes, she is. Mm-hmm. - She looks like a stewardess. - Okay. [Sighs] I don't know. I don't know. - She's... she's way out of my league. - Hey, no one is out of your league. - Nobody, man. - You are a Viking. You rape and you pillage and you take what's yours. What? Don't. Okay, obviously... obviously don't rape her. - Don't rape people. - That's not... - you really think I can do this? BRUCE AND CAL: - Yes! yes! [Sighs] All right, I'm gonna do it. What do I have to lose, right? - Oh, yeah? - Yes. Yeah. Oh, wow. - Whoa! All the way in. - All right. You have to finish it before you... it looked like there was so much less. There it is, dude. [Grunts] [Chuckles] - Go get them! - All right. Yeah. Go get 'em. Get get it, dude. Just don't try to be funny because you're not funny at all, and don't talk about Laura 'cause you'll cry like a little girl. - Okay, buddy? - Okay. Way to go, idiot. She's way out of his league. No, she's not. She's like... oh, God. Now that I'm actually looking at her, she is incredibly hot. He's dead. ♪ Baby, I feel it coming around ♪ - S-sit down. Sit down. - Sit down. Excuse me. Hey, c-can I buy you a drink... Please? - Do I know you? - Nope. No, no. No. I'm a stranger. I'm Tom. BRUCE: Let me tell you about my boy Tom. He was born in 1986 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. His mother was overjoyed. His father... not so much. [Tires squeal] Tom's father left when Tom was six. Bye, dad. Tom didn't figure that out till he was nine. Tom grew up desperately trying to make his mom happy. This would ruin all of his relationships with girls for the next 10 years. Then at a college party in our dorm... Hey! Hey, hey! I introduced him to Laura Johnson. They quickly fell in love. Yeah, bring the weed. I still own that Speedo. Oh, Laura loved how much Tom doted on her, and they smashed it out about five times a week. After graduation, Tom and Laura moved into a super-white section of Brooklyn and got engaged. [Woman squeals] [Laughs] - Beautiful! - Oh, my God! It was the happiest Tom had ever been. It's over with us. What? Uh, what do you mean? I'm just not feeling it anymore. [Gasps] Wait. Are you serious? I just woke up this morning and I looked over at you and everything about you repulsed me. [Chuckles] Repulsed? Like how? Like physically. Like, looking at your face made me want to barf. Maybe it was something you ate. - We had Korean barbecue last night. - No, it was you. It was your face. You look like a beaver. Laura, we've talked about this like 20 times. I can't help my beaver face. BRUCE: Never liked her, dude. - Not in college, not after, not ever. - Bruce, you introduced us. Yeah, dude, 'cause I thought she was a whore. I didn't think you were gonna marry her. - Don't talk like that. You know I still... - Don't. [Voice Breaking] I still love her. I just wish I knew why she left. What did I do wrong? Well, dude, get him a Kleenex right now. What are you... [Grunts] Look, man, he doesn't have Kleenex, okay? Guys don't have Kleenex. Yeah, they do. I'm a guy. I have Kleenex. - You have Kleenex? - Yeah, dude. I have Kleenex strewn all over my apartment. Why do you have so much Kleenex? Why do you think I have so much Kleenex, Cal? I pop off everywhere. - I'm gonna call Laura again. - What? - No, no, no. - Hey, look. Hey, okay, look. We get it. This whole thing is drudging up a bunch of stuff about your old man leaving. You know, sometimes people leave without saying why. Oh, dude, I didn't even think about that about his dad. - Yeah. - I hadn't thought about it either. - God, that's incredible. - Yeah, it's crushing. - Can you imagine that? - No. You guys, this is making me feel a lot worse. Hey, look over here. Here's the plan, Stan. You're gonna go to that computer, you're gonna download a whole bunch of weird illegal porno. You need to go to that dirty porno site I sent you... mekahataton.com. Remember that? Eventually you'll get over that pig fart Laura, okay? She'll be out of your brain. You'll start banging super-questionable, shallow girls. You'll hate yourself afterwards, but then you'll meet someone, dude. Someone hot, smart, nice, cool, cute. Like the perfect girl for Tommy, okay? Yeah. And you'll totally blow that because you always do. You'll be way too into her and too clingy, and she'll be like, "I don't even like this guy." and that story usually ends with a restraining order, - which, for the record, wasn't necessary. - Okay. All right, just stop talking. Shut up. Okay, the point is... You'll meet someone else. - Someone hotter... - Mm-hmm. - With a big ass. - A big ass is good? Big booties are what's in, dude. Yes. We'll get you a big, thick booty. Black guys were right all along. We should've listened to them. - Let's go catch a big booty. - Let's go. You feel better? - Yeah. - Come on. - All right. - Attaboy. Can... can I buy you a drink? Uh, yeah, I got a second. Sit. Really? Oh, neat. [Singsong voice] Okay, this is gonna go well. ♪♪♪ - There you are. - Hey. So, how come when I dumped you three minutes ago, you were all like, "Okay"? W-what did you want me to say? I wanted you to be pissed. I mean, couldn't you have at least pretended to be hurt? Look, I-I was hurt. I was hurt. - Really? - Of course not. [Gasps] Look, I-I'm sorry if I hurt you, Sharee, - But, the thing is, you got to... - Sharee? Who's Sharee? Okay, I've temporarily forgotten your name. [Gasps] I-it's, uh... Mi... Carol. No, it's not Carol. It's 2013. No one is named Carol anymore. Oh, my God. I am never talking to you again. Is it Jennifer? No! It is so not Jennifer! [Sighs] So, this is, uh, just want to say thank you for talking to me. [chuckles] So, well, what's your name? - Maya. - Maya? Wow, it sounds like a fancy bird. You seem like a very nice lady. Unfortunately, Tom's an idiot. Maya is not a very nice lady. [Grunting] [Screaming] It's comming! Maya was born in 1984 in the front seat of her father's pickup truck. [Baby crying] She had her first beer one minute later. She was the third of six girls. Unfortunately... Her father didn't like girls. He raised Maya like a son, teaching her basketball, baseball, and fighting for no reason. Maya learned that acting like a... [Bleep] [bleep] Got her exactly what she wanted, including a basketball scholarship to Phelps University. Maya loved conflict and hated people. So naturally, she became a lawyer. She took a job at Miran Hartwick & Fritz, the premier sports law firm in the country. Did you see our newest client? Mnh-mnh. Who? Keyshawn Johnson. He's down the hall. Is he still hot? [Sighs] That man is climbable. I mean, I... Whoa, no, no, no, no. Don't do this again. - Do what? - Don't date any more pro athletes. I have to date pro athletes, Liv. They're the only real men left. Oh, what about Jim's friend Jeff? No. Come on. I'm done dating white guys. They're all too soft. Isn't that right, Carl? See? That's what I mean. If I talked like that to Don Draper, he would smack me in the mouth. That is a man, not this. Not Carl. That's not nice. It's his birthday today. Happy Birthday, Carl. Yay! We all signed a card. Why do you do that to people? - Do what? - Are you serious? He's on his way to his office to hang himself with his big-and-tall tie. Liv, how is a person ever supposed to improve unless you point out their weaknesses to them? Ugh. Anyway, the only thing I was trying to say here was don't date Keyshawn Johnson. - I won't. - One more time. I will not date Keyshawn Johnson. Hey, Keyshawn?! Yeah, what's up? Oh, hey, did you call the guy about the plumbing? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I talked to him. Thank you. - Whose are these? - I don't know. Yours. Are you cheating on me with someone very small? [Scoffs] Come on. We've been dating for like a couple of months. Right? I'm sure you've had some fun along the way. [Sniffles] Don't... Key, do not cry. You're a three-time pro-bowler. [Clears throat] Stop it. You are the biggest bitch that I've ever met. The biggest. And Keyshawn Johnson has seen some bitches. [Scoffs] Well, thank you. I am a very nice lady. So, my exotic princess, where are you from? - Pittsburgh. - Nice. Go Phillies. - Pirates. - Pirates! Right. Great, you know. Look, I'm... I'm sorry. God, I suck at this. [Sighs] My... my fiancée of eight years just dumped me, and you're basically the first girl I've talked to since, like, 2005. Well, that would explain the shirt. Look, look, look. Meet Ron. - Wow, he is really cute. - Right? Okay, check this out. [Cellphone beeps] Oh, my God. Is that his... Yes, it is. Oh, my God. Please... Please put that away. Grow up, Pippi Longstocking. Everybody does it nowadays. It's good manners. It's like shaking hands. Well, okay, I think it's gross. You know, what's gross is the picture I sent back to him. Jessica, why would you do that? Janey, I've got three years left to find a guy who maybe has a job and doesn't hate my kids and is crazy enough to marry me. But I am worried about this guy. I just think we should just get out of here. Too late. He's here. He is hot. He looks like a Disney prince. - Laugh. - What? Just laugh, dude. [Both laugh] [English accent] Excuse me. Hello. Uh, are you Jessica? Well, that depends on who's asking. [Vomits] Oh, my God! My bad. ♪♪♪ - Well, um... - Um, okay. I'll just pop that shut. [Gasps] I'm horribly sorry. The truth is, I'm actually a little bit drunk. Mm-hmm. I'd offer to buy you a new purse, but, sadly, I just lost all my money. Yeah, my start-up just died. So since breakfast, I have lost $17.3 million. Oh, my God. That sounds really bad. Okay, well, it was nice meeting you, Ron. Right, yeah. Um, I think this went quite well. Sorry about that. You don't happen to have a mint, do you? I did... In my purse. Keep it. Keep it. Um... Cheers. [Thud] [Shatters] That's a fire hazard. Hey. I forgot to ask if I could have Wednesday off. Josh said he'd cover for me. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Thank you. Uh-huh. I'm still angry. Okay. The worst part is, she... she didn't give me an explanation, you know? She just... treated her so well, you know? I... [Sighs heavily] [Voice breaking] We went jean shopping together. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, my God, dude. He's crying. Okay, no. Wait. Maybe this is good. You know, they're probably having a heart to heart. Oh, yeah, and maybe we'll win the lottery later and then get a ride home on unicorns that poop money. She always wore jeans because she hated her legs, and I told her, "You have awesome legs. You should wear skirts more often," but she never did. Except once, on my birthday, she wore capris, and her legs looked amazing. Okay, um, I'm sorry. I can't take this anymore. Do you want to know why your fiancée left you? Yes. Uh, she left you because you're a sniveling little bitch. What? No, no, no. I'm... I'm nice. Uh, are you nice or are you just scared of people not liking you? Because there's actually a difference. Look at me, John. - Tom! - Tom, look at me. Every girl wants a nice guy, okay? But we also need a man, all right, who isn't afraid to say, "I'm not going jean shopping with you, all right? I'm a man. Respect my balls, woman." you know what I mean? No. No, I don't know what you mean. Just figure out what you want and then go out and get it. That's what real men do every single day. It's no mystery. It's not difficult. And if you ever want to get laid again, first, you have to learn how to be a man, okay? Because right now, listening to you makes me want to kill myself. - Okay. - Okay? [Sighs] [Sighs] - Can I just say something? - What? [Sighs] This has been so helpful. - Oh, okay. Good. - No, I-I-I... [Sighs] I've been trying to figure out why Laura left. - It's not her. It's me. - Mm-hmm. I'm a little bitch. - Yes. [Chuckles] - This is fantastic! - Is it? - Yes, yes. I finally have an answer. I can finally just move on. - Oh, thank you. - No. Oh! Great. Now he's attacking her. Okay, yeah, this is getting pretty weird. Yep. Let's just pay our bill and quietly leave. - Miss, we need to close out. - Um... You're done. [Sighs] - Like, can I get your number? - Wow. You're kidding. [Laughs] You just said to be a man and go after what I want, so that's what I'm doing. Give me your number, woman. Oh. [Laughs] - I'm sorry. was that too much? - That's... I would really appreciate your cellular-phone number. Okay, look at you. Okay, fine. Good job. Good job. - Do you have a pen? - Oh, my... really? - Oh, my gosh. - Oh, you don't have a pen. I don't have a pen. Oh, my. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Pen. CAL: Oh, is he get... is he getting her number? BRUCE: What? What is happening? - That is my boy. - Dude, good coaching. - I'm not gonna lie. That's pretty amazing. - Yeah. I'm like the Phil Jackson of The Dating Game, sir. - He's retired, by the way. - Don't be so literal. - Are you trying say that I... - I'm just saying don't... - should retire? - Why don't you do an active coach? And you realize this has been, like, the worst pickup in human history. Yeah, but it'll be a hilarious story we tell our kids one day. - I hate kids. - Me, too. They are so loud. Here you go. - God, I'm gonna call the hell out of you. - Don't do that. - Love your handbag, by the way. - Okay. I feel like I can fly. You guys, exchange numbers. It feels... it feels good. - That's my boy. - This is crazy. - That's my boy. - Yeah. I don't believe it. Oh, my God. Excuse me. Oh, geez. Cal, Bruce! Tommy! Get over here, man. [Laughs] My God. I did it. Sit down. Sit down, huh? I think I met my wife. I don't know. Well, okay. Well, let's not jump all over that, man. Just relax, all right? - Hi. - Oh, hi. - Hi. - Hey. - Guess what you missed. - What? Uh, I got hit on by the weirdest dude. Oh, no. I wish I could've seen that. - Uh, Liv, he cried. - Another one? What are you doing, Maya? Are you hitting them? And he decided that he was gonna ask me for my phone number. You didn't actually give him your phone number did you? No, I did. He was so stupid and happy. It felt... it felt good. Aww, that's like the first time you ever did something nice for someone. - No! - Toast to my boy Tommy, huh? - Give me some love. - Cheers. Bam. Bam. To Tommy. You picked yourself up by your penis and you played like a champion tonight. - Big Red is proud of you, huh? - I'm very proud of you, too. Thank you. I got to tell you, we work well together, man. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. ♪ I see you, kid, alone in your room ♪ This is the story of 10 strangers, one night, and all the ridiculous things we do to find love. ♪ Your world is just beginning ♪ ♪ And I know this life seems never-ending ♪ And the night has just begun. Yeah, hang on. No, no, no. Yeah, I can hear you. It was just loud. Excuse me. Uh, yeah, no. We're just... we're just gonna have one drink, and then I'll be home. Oh, don't watch... Don't watch "Devious Maids" without me. Okay. Love you, too. Sorry to bother you. Do you have a piece of gum? No... Gum. I... I have... I have none gum. I have... I'm gumless. [Laughs] - I'm sorry. I don't do this. - You don't do what? I, uh, um... I-I don't talk to British people. That's quite smart, actually. We're all wankers and perverts. No, no, no. I love British people, and scones I love. They're like a muffin but hard, which is better sometimes. Thank you. I'll... I'll, uh, call the queen and congratulate her. [Laughing] Okay. I'm Ron, by the way. Uh, Liv. It was very nice to meet you, Ron. Well, wait. Wait, wait. Please, will you have a drink with me? CAL: Should we just leave? No, no. I don't want to leave. I want to crush. What? There's a few girls here I can smash out. - My goodness. - Ooh, she fine. - Hey. - Ooh, she fine. - Hey, how you doing? - Ooh, she fine. - Thanks, bro. - All right, good. - We don't, uh... we don't do that. - We're... we're not together. None of this stuff. No sword fights for us, man. You know, you remind me of Danny bonaduce. You look more like a Danny bona-douche-y. You listen here, black guy from every commercial ever. You trying to say I'm non-threatening? - You go... - Don't mess with me tonight. - Dude, seriously? - Don't. - Why you pushing me? - Don't when I'm... huh? you want to go toe to toe, Cal? Look at that chick over there throwing up. Oh. I'm gonna bang her out. - All right, well, have... - Excuse me, miss? .::Sync and corrected by thatjulio::. .::www.addic7ed.com::.
