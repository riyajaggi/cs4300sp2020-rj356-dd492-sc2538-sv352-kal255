 Oh, my God! What the hell? Hey, no, Liv! No kissing the nice man! All right! Up. Up. Up. Up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. She's drunk. She doesn't know what she's doing. She's going... [Gasps] Liv, did you call your fiancé? Because... he's here. [Gasps] Oh, crap. Do you think he can see me? Sync and corrected by thatjulio www.addic7ed.com What the hell are you doing? You must be the fiancé. - [Grunts] - Maya: Whoa!

 [All gasp] Oh, my God! - Hey, watch it, buddy. What are you... - Back off, bro! Oh, my God. Uh, Jim? Jim, wait! No, I'm okay. Thanks, everyone. Um... [Chuckles] Ooh. God, I love a Scorpion Bowl. They're so dangerous. Dude, remember the last time we got one of these? Tom got so drunk, he ran into a tree. [Laughing] Yeah, you moron. What can I say? I crashed like Crawley! [Laughs] Crashed like Crawley! That is genius! [Both laugh] What does that mean? Like Matthew Crawley, from "Downton Abbey," when he dies? Mnh. Matthew Crawley dies? Have you two been watching season three without me?! No. What? [Chuckles nervously] Oh, my God! You have! Look, it's not personal, but sometimes it's really hard to watch TV with you. You just make fun of everything the whole time. I concur. Okay, that's super-personal. Like when? Like when you said "period dramas are for people on their periods." [Laughs] That's awesome. I said that? It's funny. Sometimes me and Cal, we get together, and we... We watch TV on our own, and it's really nice. Yeah. Tom makes the best finger sandwiches. Oh, oh, does he? I'm so glad you like those. I really do. I really [Chuckles] [Chuckles] That's great. That's it. I am sick of carrying this team and not getting the recognition I deserve. I am done with you nerds. And I'm taking my Scorpion Bowl. Come on. You know we can just order another one, right? Where are you going? Well, I'm gonna go find some new friends who appreciate my skills and my talents. - What skills? - What talents? I'm very good at table tennis. [Laughs] I'm excellent at recording songs off the radio that all of us like to enjoy. And I'm phenomenal hugger, and you know that, Cal. Did he just dump us? - Jessica, I just wanted to say... - Please don't. It is a complicated situation. Mm, really? No, because you showed up drunk, you puked in my purse, and then you kissed another girl while I was talking to you. What's complicated about any of that? Yeah. When you list it like that, in sequential order, it makes me sound like a total wanker. Or maybe I am just... A total wanker. I'm really sorry. [Sighs] [Groans] He's so cute. Really? Jim! Jim! Stop! What's going on, Liv? I'm sorry. I went a little crazy tonight, but seeing you here in your vest, I just... I know I want to be with you. We're just making such a big decision, and I think I freaked out a little bit. The truth is, Liv and Jim were perfect for each other. Jim was owner and executive chef at a chic Manhattan restaurant. Liv loved all of Jim's food, even his head cheese soup, which pretty much everyone agreed was gross. Jim's success afforded him a sweet Manhattan apartment. They even had one of those TVs that comes out of the cabinet. Jim was the complete package. He was a great friend, he was great with kids, he was even great with old people. But most importantly, Liv and Jim were compatible... Like scary-compatible. Have you ever been to one of Jim and Liv's magic nights before? - Nope. - They're amazing. [Music plays] [Light laughter] Whoo! Ohh! Is this a joke? Oh! Welcome to Jim and Liv's magic night! Night, night, night, night. [Applause] I'm Jim, the Fanciful, and this is my beautiful assistant, Liv! - [Both laugh] - That's not even magic. - That's just a fake hand. - Man: That was good. That was good. For my next trick, I'm going to make my beautiful girlfriend disappear. Oh! Honey, I heard there's a sale at the shoe store. [Gasps] [Both laugh] So long! Loves shoes, this one. - [Applause] That was good. - I need cooler friends. Maybe they were a little dorky... or even a lot dorky... But Liv and Jim were perfect for each other. So perfect it sort of makes you wonder... What the hell was Liv thinking? What the hell was I thinking? I don't know, Liv. - But I'm done. - What?! Excuse me. Liv, are you okay? Hey? Hey? Where's Jim going? I don't know. Our apartment is uptown but he just marched off down that way, and I feel like he doesn't want to look silly by turning around. I really hurt him, Maya. Look at me. Look at me. You just dodged the biggest bullet of your life. Then why do I feel so bad? Because you're a girl, and you don't like hurting people. Liv, don't go wobbly on this, okay? Marrying Jim would have been like marrying a house plant or a piece of toast. I got to go get him, Maya. - Liv... - I want him back. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay, let's go get him back, then. [All cheering] Bruce: What's up, fellas? Uh, you mind if me and my Scorpion Bowl take a seat? Uh, sure! [Chuckles] Give me a straw, bro! Give me a straw. [Chuckles] Awesome, yeah. Get in there. My name is Bruce, man. I like big, fake boobs, deep house beats, and movies with explosions. [Laughter] I like this guy! Right? - What a find! - Yes! Yes! This guy's hilarious. [Laughter] Well, he certainly found new friends quickly. He opens strong. Give it time. I mean, I'm really having fun with just you. Oh, totally. This is a blast! [Chuckles] - [Sighs] How's your dog? - I don't have a dog. Hey. I saw what happened before. This one's on me. Oh, thank you, but I am heading off before my night can get any worse. Hey. No, no, no, no. You can't give up. Ask your friend. Oh, no. Look, I gave up on my music, and your friend said a lot of very mean stuff to me. So I picked up my guitar, and it changed my life forever... I think. I mean, this only happened an hour ago. And, I'm sorry, what does this have to do with me leaving the bar? It means you can't give up on your dreams because they always come true the second time you try them. Not at all what I said. Look, I have a break coming up in five minutes. So why don't you stay, have a drink? And then I'm gonna rock your world. Oh, my. Uh, wo... wow! You know what? Okay. Okay. Drink up. [Snaps fingers] And that is why I'm from Ohio but still love the Lakers. [Laughs] And the Lakers are...? - Basketball. - Yes! Basketball. Michael Jordan. Oh, yeah! I'm dying! I'm dying! I'm dying! I'm dying! Oh! God, he's killing it over there. And so I said to the guy, "I don't know, bro. That's not my cucumber." [Laughter] That is the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life! I know. I know. It is. Okay, okay. I got to know. Yeah? Do you do stand-up comedy, Bruce? Nah, dude. I don't really do jokes, you know what I mean? My comedy is more, uh, edgy and improvisational. Ohh. So, what are you doing Saturday? Your mother? [Laughter] He's doing your mom! Because I'm getting married, and I'd really like you to be there. Oh, yeah?! Really?! Yeah! Oh, Jeff! I'll be there! Oh! Oh, dude! Awesome! Yeah. - Well, what are we celebrating tonight? - Oh, dude! - It is Dave's birthday. - What?! Dave?! Yes, it is. It's my birthday. What?! This is a birthday party?! [Laughter] Oh, wow! You guys don't look like you're in 3rd grade! [Laughs] What do you mean, Bruce? Yeah, can you explain your joke, Bruce? You know, it's like, uh, aren't we a little too old to be celebrating our birthdays? I mean, congrats on turning 27. You went another year without dying! [Laughs] You know, what an amazing feat, you didn't fall down a manhole this year! [Laughs] Oh, you lived again? Cool. Loser. [Laughs] Who cares? I've been planning this night for three months, dude. Three months? Yeah, Dave loves his birthdays, man. Hmm. Yeah, maybe you should go, Bruce. You're actually kind of obnoxious. Yeah. - I miss funny Bruce. - Me, too. You know, yeah, I got to go, anyw... what is it? Whoa, I got to get out of here. I'll probably just... [Coughs] Yeah. [Clears throat] See you guys at Jeff's wedding. Yeah, I just found out we don't have room anymore. Oh, that's too bad, because I'm still coming, with a plus-one. - You're not invited. - I'm still coming, Jeff! - No! - Yes! - Jim! - He doesn't even know where he's going. Jim! Jim! I'm sorry I hurt you. I just got so wrapped up in my own stuff that I forgot to think about you. Well, it's too late. Look, Jim. We both know that I don't like you. No, I-I-I didn't know that. I've told you you're boring like a thousand times. - I thought you were kidding! - No. I told you she wasn't kidding. The point is, I don't like you. So, tonight, I tried to get Liv to spread her wings and live a little and maybe even think twice about marrying you. But kissing random dudes and giving guys her panties isn't who Liv is. You gave guys your panties? - Technically they were Maya's panties. - The bottom line is... Liv is still the same cute, dorky, awesome girl you fell in love with. Don't throw away everything the two of you have built just because I made her go crazy for one night. That's stupid. Look at her, Jim. She loves you. - I don't know why. Look at that outfit... - Okay, thank you, Maya. I guess... I got a little nervous about getting married, too. The day I proposed, I put a radish in a bouillabaisse. Whoa. I know. It was insane. Can we just go home and put on our pajamas and watch "Mike & Molly"? Tonight's the episode where Molly eats too much pie. Oh, I love that one. Let's go home. [Sighs] I'll get us a cab. You're an amazing friend. Bye! I was going to save this as a surprise, but I got us tickets to "La Bohéme" for next Friday. Ooh, the opera. How exciting. Oh, and they're using the original arias, so this is the extended version. That does sound longer. Gummybear? You okay? No, dude. Gummybear was not okay. Like all couples who've been dating for a while, Jim and Liv eventually fell into a comfortable rut. So Liv decided to spruce it up. Hey, honey? - Hey, Liv, look... I'm juggling! - I want to go to India. - What does that mean? - I just want more, Jim. Is this an "Eat, Pray, Love" thing? No! Maybe. [Sighs] Obviously yes. But it's also a "me thing". I'm restless, Jim. What if we did something a little more local? My parents have that time-share in Boca Raton. Damn it, Jim! It has to be India! I want to go and dance with wise old men! I want to eat food that might kill me. And I want to play with elephants. And I want to meet Omar Sharif. Let's do that. - Oh, my God, seriously?! - Yeah. Oh, thank you, babe. Oh, my God! [Chuckles] But they never went. There was always a reason not to go. First, Jim got a new job. Then it was too close to the holidays. Then Jim wanted to go to magic camp. And with every passing year, Liv only got more restless. 'Cause if you don't like "La Bohéme," that's fine. We can do anything. I heard The Guggenheim has a new vase. Stop the cab! I want to go to India right now. If we don't, I'm gonna explode. But what about our jobs and the wedding? Plus, I thought we were gonna start trying to get pregnant. If we're gonna have five kids, then we gotta start soon. It's common to get cold feet before a wedding. Sadly, it's also common to marry the absolute wrong person.
