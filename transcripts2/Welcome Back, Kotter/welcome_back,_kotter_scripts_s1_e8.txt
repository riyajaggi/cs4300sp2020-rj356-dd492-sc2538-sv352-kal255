Just once. Just once, that's all I'm asking. She told me, Epstein. She told me. Who? What? Who told you what? Susie. You hit on her at the party. Tried to make out with my chick. Hey, I wouldn't go near her. Face it, Ludlow, the lady's a dog. You're calling my Susie a dog? Yeah, well, name me another girl that barks and rolls over. That does it, Epstein let's go. Hey, take it easy, man. Take it easy. I'm, uh, trying to figure out what your new face is gonna look like. Hey, my friend, a word of warning: Epstein was voted most likely to take a life. Oh, man. Shucks. Yeah, I voted three times. You coming, Cream Puff? Ooh! Horshack, my bandana, please. Yes, sir. I accept your challenge. Fisticuffs, close range... Hey, give him room. Give him room. Give him room. Let's go. Hey, that way. Have a good time. We ought to find out Ludlow's blood type and start rounding up donations. Okay, okay. You people are going the wrong way. What's going on? Hey, Dr. Epstein is performing a nose transplant. Ah, there ain't nothing like a brisk morning workout, boys. Where's Epstein, man? All right, get into class. But we gotta find Epstein. I'll find Epstein. Go into cl... Come on, Horshack, get into class. Where's Epstein? He's back there on the floor. Go to your class. Epstein, are you okay? Hey, look at me, man. So you got a black eye, huh? Hey, you didn't look that terrific to begin with. Come on, we're gonna be late for class. I ain't going to class, man. I ain't never going to class. Where you going then? I don't know, uh... into the religious life. Brother Epstein, huh? See the headlines: "Puerto Rican Jew joins monastery... becomes the first schlamonk." Hey, so you got beat up? Big deal. I mean, I got beat up plenty of times. You think no one's gonna understand? Yeah, that's what I think. Hey, Juan, those kids in there, the Sweathogs, they're your friends. Ah, man, nobody likes a loser, man. Hey, you know why you're leaving? 'Cause you don't have the guts to stay. Who says? I say. Oh, yeah? Well, who are you to say? I am the ghost of Sweathog past. Oh, man. Hey, if I am wrong, may a thousand Mr. Woodmans move into my apartment building. Come on, you go back and you face your friends, and then I'll take you to the nurse. You get that eye fixed up. Epstein. Hey, man. Are you okay? Let's check it out, man. Whooo! Wow. See, huh? They're still your friends. Of course we're still his friends. We're sure... We're sure his friends, man. Man, we're Sweathogs. Our hearts go out to losers. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Epstein is not a loser. Hey, Mr. Kotter, I'm only talking about the fight. Which he did lose. Hey, but you're my main man. You could be a big one, and all that other stuff, man. You know, like, um... Like knitting... and, um, like, um... ballet. Look, Epstein, you're still our friend, and we respect you for who you are. A totally beaten man. Okay, though, I am truly grievously upset with you, Epstein. How can I expect everybody to respect me when my very meanest friend turns out to be a cream puff? Hey, you lied, man. No, man. Now that ain't the toughest kid, I'm nobody, man. I'm nothing, man. We were only kidding. It's supposed to be... Mrs. Epstein, do you have any idea where he might have gone? Beside the zoo with the rest of the animals. Look, I'll tell you what: If I locate him, I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything. Okay. You've been a great help, Mrs. Epstein. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. It's incredible. Absolutely incredible. Her son's been missing for three days. And the only thing she says is: "Hey, Murray, no wonder there was an extra sausage last night." Honey, maybe that's why being a tough guy is so important to him. Nobody ever shows him any love. Yeah, well, before I love him, I gotta find him. If he only knew how much everybody wanted him back. Well, what should I do? Stand on the steps of the school and start singing: ♪ Won't you come home Juan Epstein? ♪ ♪ Won't you come home? ♪ ♪ We moan a whole night long ♪ Come on, let's go. ♪ We'll do the cooking, Juan We'll pay the rent ♪ Good morning, Mrs. Kotter. Wherever you are. Goodbye, Mr. Kotter. ♪ Remember that rainy evening ♪ Out. Goodbye. ♪ Oh, you had nothing, we're fine... ♪ ♪ I know I'm to blame, Well, ain't that a shame ♪ ♪ Juan Epstein Won't you please come home... ♪ Hello? ♪ I really mean it... ♪ Epstein Central. Epstein ain't here, Barbarino speaking. Well, if he ain't there, try that store on the corner with the big sign that says, "We never close." Oh, it's closed? All right, then try the Staten Island ferry. No, stupid, it's a boat. All right, the rest of you guys take Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island too. ♪ Hey, tell me what street ♪ ♪ Compares with my street In July ♪ Sit down. Sit down. Hey, Barbarino, what's going on in here? This is a classroom, not Allied command headquarters. This is our all-out effort to find our friend, Epstein. You was right, Mr. Kotter. It was sort of our fault, his running away and all. But we're gonna make up for it. Everybody's out looking everywhere. You wanna help? Here, be a blue pin. Forget the blue pin. There's a red phone on that table. What? That. That's a red phone. Where? Right over there. That? That is a red phone on the table. Now, where did that red phone come from? Oh, we found it. Lying around. In Mr. Woodman's office. Ohhh. Horshack, it's good to see you. What's the story in Coney Island? Twelve potato knishes. Who told you that you had to eat 12 knishes? They did. The knishes? They speak to you? Yes. They said: "Arnold. Arnold. Eat us. We're fluffy. We're delicious." Oh, but they lied. Arnold, you can't trust a knish. I think you'd better sit down, you're knished-out. What is the meaning of all this? Well, for class today, Mr. Woodman, they're conducting a missing-persons bureau. They're trying to locate one Juan Epstein. Huh. He might have joined the circus. May have been an opening for a half man, half beast. My red phone. What's it doing here? What? That's my red phone, Kotter. Where? Right there. That? That's my red phone. Where did it come from? They found it. Lying around. In your office. Just a minute, Kotter. Don't answer that. No one under any circumstances answers my red phone except me, and give it to me. Hello? It's for you. Hello. Hi, Julie. What...? What? I'll be right there. You gotta take over my class. Just pretend you're in charge. I gotta go home. Epstein showed up. Where? ALL: Where? At my apartment. Right now, he's locked in my bathroom. I gotta get there before he drowns my rubber duck. Juan, you've been in there for over an hour. You must be awfully hot and thirsty by now. How would you like a nice cold soda? Sure I would, but I'm a punk. Punks don't deserve nice cold sodas. What do you got that's warm and flat? Hi, honey. Hi. Is he still in there? Uh-huh. Juan, Mr. Kotter's here. I'll be right back with your flat soda. Don't go anywhere. Where would I go? Epstein, it's me. Where have you been? Missing. Actually, I'm still missing. Epstein, you're not missing. You're in my bathroom. Right now, I wanna take a bath. Why? It ain't Saturday. Epstein, come outta there, or I'm gonna break this door down. No, you won't. That's what you're supposed to say in situations like this. You know what you're also supposed to say? What? Now, see here, Leo. Now, come out with your hands up. Oh, you dirty rat. You'll never take me alive, copper. Ah. Never, copper. Never, never. That's not bad, Epstein. You liked that? A little higher. Higher? "You'll never take me alive." You'll never take me alive. Put your thumbs in your pants. Got it. Okay, you know what I'm gonna do now? Ooh, you know what I'm gonna do now? I'm coming outta this bathroom. I'm coming outta this bathroom. ♪ I'm a Yankee Doodle dandy ♪ ♪ I'm a Yankee Doodle boy ♪ Hey, no way. Almost worked, sweetheart. Juan, this is Julie. I've got your flat soda for you. Pour it under the door. The only way you're gonna it is to get your tail outta there. Look, Mrs. Kotter's out there, and I don't feel like facing a woman. Don't worry, Juan. I'll lock myself in the bathroom. Okay, look, you gotta promise me one thing, Mr. Kotter. I promise. What did I promise? That you don't look at me. Okay. I'll look at a lamp. Well, Epstein, nice to see you again. You lost a little weight, haven't you? Hey, Mr. Kotter, the second rule after don't look at me, is don't make fun of me. If you didn't want me to look at you, then why did you come here? To say goodbye. I'm running away to join the circus. Don't you know... Don't look at me. Look at the lamp. Don't you know... that the one thing you can't run away from is yourself? Because no matter where you go, lamp, you go with you. So, why don't you go back to school? I can't. Epstein, could I please look at you? I can't get through to this lamp. Okay, but, like, kinda like have no expression on your face. Epstein. Now tell me why you can't go back? 'Cause I'm a punk. My friends were right when they said I'm a punk. Uh, a child of the streets. A fly speck on the highway of life. Hey, nobody cares about me, man. Okay, then you tell me why those kids have been combing the city looking for you? They have not. They have. In their own way, of course. Hey, they care about you, Juan. We all care about you. Then how come you didn't write? Juan, you poor baby. Don't look at me. Look at the lamp. You know what I see? What? I see a sensitive, bright, energetic kid, that has a lot more going for him than muscle. You see that? Where? Where is that guy? Show me, where? I'll show you where that guy is. That guy is in here: And that guy is in here: Yeah, how about right here? There's nothing in there, Juan. It's empty. Nothing. However, you are going to meet a tall dark stranger. Honey, I'm through looking at the lamp, and now I'm answering the window. Hi. I told you over and over and over again, don't come in through the window. There's a door over there. You see, a door? What do you think it's used for? At least they're making progress. They knocked. Epstein, how you doing? You ready to come back and wipe out Todd Ludlow, huh? We figured you've rested up enough to get back a little Sweathog honor. Yeah, you could hit him, and kick him and knock him down the stairs and step on him. I don't know. Epstein, what's the matter with you? Maybe Epstein has decided that there's more to being a man than winning or losing a fight. That manliness is not measured by the amount of macho a guy's got. Right you are, Mr. Kotter. I get along without any macho at all. Yeah, I'm holding it for him till he gets older. Hey, look, a real man's got to be tough. No way, Freddie. Are you saying just 'cause Ludlow took me out that I'm less than a man? I mean, how about what I think and how I feel? That's a lot of jive words from Mr. Kotter. No way. Hey, man, look. He don't know nothing about living in the streets today, man. Nothing. Freddie, what makes you think that today is any different than yesterday? Where do you think I got this nose from? From a novelty store? Horshack, this nose has been all over the place. One year, it was over here. One year is in back here. One year, I had to hide it in my locker, to make sure it was safe. As long as we still got to be living here, there's gonna be times when we got to resort to fighting. You understand? No. No, I don't understand. You don't understand that you have a choice. You can use this: And maybe you guys will stay in this neighborhood the rest of your lives. Or you can use what's in here, and what's in here, and you got a shot at getting outta here. I mean, it's all up to you. Let... Let me translate. Everybody make a fist. Aw. Come on, make a fist. All right. Okay. Now open it up. You see, there's nothing in there. Heh. What? Right here. There's nothing there. Where? Why don't you call your mother, Juan? She's worried about you. You know something, Mrs. Kotter? What, Juan? It's not much fun being missing. I mean, like, you walk around all day, but you're not really there, you know? Hello? Pedro. Yeah, yeah, it's me. Hey, do me a favor, put Ma on the phone, will ya? Hello, Ma? Oh, Irving. Yeah. Hey, Irving, c-could you get Ma to the phone? Thanks. Hello, Ma? Sanchez? Uh, S-Sanchez, could you get Ma on the phone? Hello, Ma? It's me, Juan. Juan Epstein. Number six. Short guy, curly hair. Antisocial. Right. Right. Yeah, well, I'm at the Kotters'. Yeah, I'm coming home. Yeah. Okay. Here. Hello, Mrs. Epstein. Yeah, he's fine, safe and sound. Okay, I'm gonna send him home. Okay, I will. She says if you were planning to come home for dinner, that you should eat here. Your sausage was already committed. Why don't you all come back here for dinner? Hey, that's a great idea, Mrs. Kotter. You know, Epstein, you were right. There is nothing there. Hey, man, maybe you don't got to beat up on a guy to prove yourself. That's right. Use your head, and get somebody else to do it for you. We're all gonna have supper together, but we gotta go back to school right now, so come on, let's go. We got a lot to learn. All right. Okay. See you later, Mrs. Kotter. Bye-bye, Arnold. Bye. ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Your dreams were your Ticket out ♪ Did I tell you about my Uncle Bernie who never took a bath? No. This is true. I had an Uncle Bernie, never took a bath. Really? Yeah. Now, one time he's gone away to vacation, you know? He's got two friends of his. One's a guy from India, and one's a guy from Israel. Right? Mm-hm. Their car breaks down. Mm-hm. Knocks on a farmer's door, says: "There's three of us here. We have no place to sleep for tonight. Our car broke down." The farmer says, "Well, two of you can sleep here. One has to sleep in the barn, 'cause we don't have any room." Which one slept in the barn? First the guy from India says, "That is all right. I will sleep in the barn, no problem." He goes to sleep in the barn. About a minute later, there's a knock. It's the guy from India. He says, "So sorry, I cannot sleep in there. There's a cow in the barn, and cow is a sacred animal. Cannot sleep with a cow." So, what happened then? The guy from Israel says: "Big deal, so I'll go sleep in the barn." He goes to the barn, and about a minute later there's a knock. It's the guy from Israel. He says, "I can't sleep. There's a pig in the barn. It's not kosher, and I can't sleep with a pig." So, what did your uncle do? Well, my uncle had to. He said, "I'll sleep in the barn." So my uncle went to the barn. A minute later there's a knock, and it's the cow and the pig. ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Your dreams were... ♪ ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Your dreams were your Ticket out ♪ ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ To that same old place That you laughed about ♪ ♪ Well the names Have all changed ♪ ♪ Since you hung around ♪ ♪ But those dreams have remained ♪ ♪ And they've turned around ♪ ♪ Who'd have thought They'd lead ya ♪ ♪ Who'd have thought They'd lead ya ♪ ♪ Back here where we need ya? ♪ ♪ Back here where We need ya? ♪ ♪ Yeah, we tease him a lot ♪ ♪ 'Cause we've got him On the spot ♪ ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Welcome back Welcome back ♪ ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Welcome back Welcome back ♪ ♪ Yeah, we tease him a lot ♪ ♪ Welcome back Welcome back ♪ ♪ 'Cause we've got him On the spot ♪ ♪ Welcome back Welcome back ♪
