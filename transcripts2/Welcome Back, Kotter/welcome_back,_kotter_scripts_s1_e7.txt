 Gabe, what are you doing out here? It's almost midnight. Just listening to the wind whistle through my shorts. What's bothering you, honey? There was something going on all week with those kids in my class. I couldn't figure out what it was. Well, then how do you know that something's going on? They're not acting like themselves. They're acting like people.

 They're talking instead of yelling. Epstein has showed up three straight days. And Barbarino hasn't tried to take over the school all week. Gabe, don't worry so much. You're the best teacher I know. I'm the only teacher you know. I'm a failure. The kids don't trust me. They had a problem, and they wouldn't come to me with it. Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a teacher. Maybe I should have gone off with Jacques Cousteau. Jacques Cousteau?

 [FRENCH ACCENT] Our ship was stuck in heavy ice. It had been a very difficult crossing. Some of the crew of Calypso had gotten friendly with pelicans.

Comes with the deal. I know. I remember the vows we wrote for our wedding. To love, honor and trust. Right. And I remember my father told you to ask for a receipt. I know. I still have it. [PHONE RINGS] [GROANS] That's my father, tell him the receipt for my birthday present is in the mail. Hello. Oh, ho... Yeah, hold on. Honey, it's Boom Boom. Boom Boom who? How many Boom Booms do you know? Freddie Boom Boom? Hi, Freddie. It's shaking fine. How's it shaking with you? Good. Don't... No, hey, don't worry. Look, you can trust me. You can trust me. Okay, bye. Freddie Washington and Vernajean Williams are coming right over here. They got a problem they wanna talk about. Put on your robe. They said they'll be right over. [KNOCKING] I wonder what took 'em so long. Quick, shut the door. I don't want nobody to see me. [AS HUMPHREY BOGART] Barbarino, are you dressed for the Late, Late Show? It's midnight, sweetheart. Did you bring the Falcon? What? Maltese falcon. Where? [NORMAL VOICE] Never mind. Barbarino, what are you doing here? Mr. Kotter. I gotta talk to you. But you gotta promise not to tell anybody. My lips are sealed. It's about Freddie and Vernajean. They're quitting school to get married. What? And they don't even have to. You gotta do something. [KNOCKING] Right now I gotta answer the door. I don't want nobody to know that I'm talking to a teacher. You gotta hide me. Quick, into the bathroom. All right. Quick. Shut the door. I don't want anybody to see me. Mr. Kotter, I gotta talk to you. Uh, Julie, what do you know? There's a Late, Late Show has the double feature tonight. Yeah, yeah. Listen, Freddie and Vernajean, they wanna get married. And you gotta stop it. [KNOCKING] I'll hide in the bathroom. KOTTER: Uh, you better not. Uh, Vinnie's hiding in the bathroom. That's okay. Close the door. I don't want nobody to see me here. [IMITATING GROUCHO MARX] I certainly don't blame you. You look ridiculous. Hey. Freddie and Vernajean wanna get married. [NORMAL VOICE] Oh, really? Ha-ha. Hear that, Julie? [LAUGHS] And you want Mr. Kotter to stop them? No. Hey, look, I don't know. I mean, like, it ought to be up to them, you know? Like, everybody's been messing with their head. You gotta get people to leave them alone. [KNOCKING] Hey. I gotta answer the door. I don't want nobody to see me. I'm gonna hide. Oh, no, no, no. You hide in the closet. HORSHACK: Quick, shut the door. I don't want nobody to see me. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] Arnold, will you please take off that head? [MOANS] It's hot in there, Mr. Kotter. I don't know how them gorillas can stand it. Mr. Kotter, I gotta talk to you. Don't tell me. Vernajean Williams and Freddie wanna get married. And you want Mr. Kotter to either stop them or leave them alone. That is truly amazing. Do you do card tricks too? Look. Arnold, I can't stop a wedding. I don't want you to stop the wedding. I think it's very romantic. I want you to stop Vinnie from stopping the wedding. VINNIE: Hey! You got somebody in the bathroom? The Ty-D-Bol man. [KNOCKING] I gotta hide me! No, you... I'll... I'll... Go on the fire escape, pretend it's the Empire State Building. Right, right. Go ahead, King Kong, okay? Whoa! That's Vernajean and Washington. What are we gonna do? I think we're gonna look for a bigger apartment. [BOTH LAUGH] Hi. How you doing? Hey. Okay. Maybe we came at a bad time. No, we were just spending [CHUCKLES] ...a quiet evening at home. Please, sit down. Hey, look, thanks for letting us fall by, Mr. and Mrs. Kotter. Yeah, we really appreciate this. So... Anything new? Well... Vernajean and me, um, we getting married. A-and don't try to talk us out of it. Can I ask you why you're getting married? Vernajean's family's moving to Staten Island. So? It's not like Staten Island's on another planet. I can see you ain't never been to Staten Island. Look, man... Anyway, Vernajean's daddy and me, we don't exactly see eye to eye. Yeah, we're not even supposed to see each other. Which is kind of hard, sitting in the same classroom. So, um... we getting married. You know, marriage is a very big step. I mean, do you really think that you're ready? Yeah, we're ready. I mean... We're in love, and... [GIGGLES] I mean, that's enough. I don't know if it is, Freddie. I mean, I am speaking as an experienced married person. And marriage is not all a bowl of cherries. Let me give you an example, okay? A wife buys a shirt for a husband. It's not an attractive shirt. I mean, he feels like a fool walking around in that shirt, right? But he wears it cause he doesn't wanna hurt her feelings. Gabe. You told me you loved that shirt. Julie, this is a hypothetical situation. I am not referring to this shirt. That is a $25 shirt. Answer the question. I hate the shirt. What else have you lied about? That's it. Nothing else. Your tuna casserole. You love my tuna casserole. No. You love your tuna casserole. Nobody puts prunes in a tuna casserole. There is no person in the civilized world... VERNAJEAN: Mr. Kotter. Mr. Kotter. Mrs. Kotter. Heh. We both know what you all are doing. You do? Mm-hm. Yeah. You're fighting in front of us so we won't get married, right? We are? VERNAJEAN: Of course. Well, any fool can see that you all really love each other. And you're only play-acting. Right. ARNOLD & EPSTEIN: Right! What was that? Mice. Well, anyway, we came over to ask you to do us a favor. If you could... give us our wedding present in advance. Yeah. Um... Could you tell our parents? Why don't I give you a toaster instead? You can write your announcement on an English muffin. Hey, look. No problem, baby. We just won't tell our folks. Conning a judge ain't no big thing. Sure, go ahead. Con a judge. There's a lot of stupid things you could do, Freddie. You could run off to Maryland, cause there's no waiting period... Hey, wait a minute. Wait. But that's not... Maryland. Hey, that's it, baby. We can go off to Maryland, lie about our age. We ain't gotta wait in Maryland. Ohh. Hey! Thanks a lot, Mr. Kotter! Thank you, man. Ha! Hey, Mr. Kotter... you are a super dude. [LAUGHS] Hey, bye, Mr. Kotter. Bye, Mrs. Kotter. Bye-bye. Bye, mice. Mrs. Kotter. Bye. [DOOR CLOSES] Way to go, super dude. You just talked them right over two state lines. Some big help you were. Now they're getting married for sure. Look, I didn't tell them... You're not our friend. You're nothing but a teacher. Why can't I be your teacher and your friend? It don't work that way, Kotter. You see... in this vast universe of ours, people are divided into two groups: us and them. You're them. We gotta go. Come on. Did you hear that, Bensonhurst? My father was right. I can't be trusted. MAN: I trust you, mac. Go to sleep. ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Your dreams Were your ticket out ♪ Good morning. STUDENTS: Good morning, Mr. Kotter. All right. Now, yesterday we had a problem... because nobody trusted anybody. Well, that's the way of the world. Barbarino, trust is a two-way street. Do you trust us? Epstein... Barbarino... Washington and Horshack. Come over here with me. What's happening, man? What for? Shazam! [ALL SHOUTING] Mr. Kotter! Whoa. Hey. How'd you know we was gonna catch you? It's the point, Barbarino. I trusted you. I knew that you guys weren't gonna let me fall on my face. Okay. Sit down. That is very impressive, Mr. Kotter. Where did you learn to do that? From the person I trust most in the world. From my wife. You mean, every day you go home, you and Mrs. Kotter fall off the furniture with each other? [ALL LAUGHING] This is an object lesson, Epstein. The trust between a husband and a wife is the strongest kind of trust there is. You know, we spend a lot of time in this school teaching you about math, about English, about science. But we don't teach you about being married. Something that eventually most of you are gonna do. So today I've decided to have a class... on how to be married. Can't learn marriage in the classroom, Mr. Kotter. You gotta pick it up on the streets. Yeah. Okay, well, I am taking it off the streets and putting it into the classroom, all right? I'm gonna act out a whole marriage in one homeroom period. That's my kind of course. Not much thinking and plenty of action. BARBARINO: All right. Okay, now, Vernajean and Freddie, you're planning to run off to Maryland to tie the knot. So, uh, you can play the leads. Oh, all right. [CHUCKLES] What you want us to do? Just improvise. You say whatever comes into your head. React to the moment. Well, I ain't playing. I ain't gonna contribute to the delinquency of a minor. Me neither. I mean, you just gave Vernajean the lead. And even though you are my dearest, dearest friend, I do not play supporting roles. Well, I'll play Mr. Kotter. Don't you need somebody to marry them? Okay, Epstein. You marry them. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! What about me? What can I do? Horshack. I've decided you're against this marriage. I am? Yes. Okay. [SINGING WAGNER'S "BRIDAL CHORUS"] ♪ Da, da-da-da ♪ ♪ Da, da, da, da Da-da-da... ♪ ♪ Da, da, da ♪ Okay, Epstein, will you please conduct the ceremony. [EPSTEIN CLEARS THROAT] [SINGING IN HEBREW] Whoo! Whoo! Hey man, that's a pretty good tune. But, um, what does that mean? I don't know, but it's on the charts in Israel. Anybody got a wine glass on 'em? GIRL: No. I got a thermos. Will that help? It'll do in a pinch. Step on it. Oh! [SINGING TRADITIONAL JEWISH TUNE] [STUDENTS CLAPPING IN TIME] [LAUGHS] Hello, hello. Uh, Mr. Fiddler, would you mind coming off your roof? EPSTEIN: Oh. Finish your ceremony. [CLEARS THROAT] Now... By the power invested in me by Mr. Kotter, I now pronounce you man and wife. Mazel tov. Who you calling a mazel tax? Freddie, he just wished you good luck. If he says anything bad, I'll let you know, okay? Aren't you forgetting something? Oh. Well, I was drinking too much coffee anyway. Okay, marriage is over. Time for the honeymoon. Oh. Kiss me, baby. Come here, baby. Mmm. Honeymoon is over. Aw... That's the honeymoon? Well, this is a 10-minute marriage. A five-second honeymoon. Just about right. Now it's time to have children. Wait, wait. What? Wait, wait, wait a minute. We wasn't planning to have no kids right away. Well, you know... accidents do happen. I think I was a accident. Okay. Arnold, you come up here. You play Vernajean's and Freddie's accident. Okay. I'm sorry, Vinnie. But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. He ain't exactly what I had in mind. Okay, now, the three of you are at home in your one-room apartment, when all of a sudden... you get a visit... from an unexpected guest. I play the unexpected guest. VERNAJEAN: Okay. Doll, I wonder who that is? [MOANS] It's Mr. Kotter playing an unexpected guest. [LAUGHS] Who is it? [IMITATING ITALIAN MOBSTER] My name is Vito Cornfeld. I am from the Strong Arm Rental Agency. [LAUGHS] I am here to collect the rent, because you people have fallen 12 years behind. Man, I thought you paid the rent! Don't worry, baby. I'm gonna handle the whole thing. [SUAVELY] Hi, there. Oh, hello. [LAUGHS] You know, I've... I've had a few business setbacks, you know, couple of bad investments, and, um... [LAUGHING] [LAUGHS] How about a little more of that, uh, time? [LAUGHING] I don't think you understand. When they send me to your door... you're time is up. [CRIES] That's the ugliest baby I ever saw in my life. [WAILING] Why don't you just go ahead and pay the man? He's upsetting my child. Uh, don't bug me... Don't bug me woman. No rent is still too much rent for this fleabag. You tell him, Pop. Don't you yell at him. It ain't his fault you can't support us. Okay, then whose fault is it? If we hadn't gotten married, I wouldn't have to quit school. Well, look, it ain't my fault that I got pregnant. I don't why we got married in the first place. 'Cause I didn't want you going off meeting new guys, that's why. And going off with those Staten Island dudes, that's why. [SIGHS] Yeah, I don't wanna play anymore. Hey. Freddie. Man, I promise to be true to you. Don't you trust me? I don't believe this. I mean, I'm worried about you guys trusting me. You don't even trust each other. [BELL RINGS] I think I just became a orphan. Little Orphan Arnold. [LAUGHS] Thanks a lot for the opportunity, Mr. Kotter. You know, I'm also available for bris and bar mitzvahs. Hey. Nice going. The way you broke up that marriage... was very sneaky. I like that in a person. Thanks a lot, Vinnie. I think you're sneaky too. Freddie. Freddie, wait a second. I mean, I don't understand something. Why didn't you tell Vernajean the way you felt before? Aw... Hey, I couldn't, man. It's just not cool to tell someone you're afraid of losing them. Hey... Freddie. Man, you wouldn't lose me. I wouldn't? Mm-mm. You mean, we don't have to get married now? Well... I'll take a rain check. Come on. Hey, thanks. [CHEERS] ♪ Da, da, da Da, da, da ♪ The, uh, mind snaps when you least expect, doesn't it, Kotter? I got through to them, Mr. Woodman. I got through to them. Pure luck, Kotter. It'll never happen again. You can't discourage me, Mr. Woodman. Nothing you can say will make me go off with Jacques Cousteau. I am invincible. I am... teacher. You are nuts. Don't be fooled by a momentary victory, Kotter. The world is divided into two parts: us and them. And they're them. And come to think of it... you're them too. Yeah? Well, thank you. [IMITATING GROUCHO MARX] That's the nicest remark I've ever heard. ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Your dreams Were your ticket out ♪ ♪ Welcome back ♪ Did I ever tell you that the Kotter family has been in outer space? No. But you will. I am serious, Julie. My uncle, Buzz Kotter. [CHUCKLES] He was an astronaut. They sent him into outer space with a monkey. Very exciting. I mean, five minutes after takeoff, a red light flashes on, tell the monkey to activate the rockets and make sure there's plenty of oxygen. Well, what did Uncle Buzz do? I'm getting to him. I'm getting to him, okay? An hour later, another green light flashes, tells the monkey to check all temperature gauges. Then about five minutes later, Uncle Buzz's red light flashes. And what did Uncle Buzz's red light tell him to do? Feed the monkey. ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Your dreams Were your ticket out ♪ [♪♪♪] ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Your dreams Were your ticket out ♪ ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ To that same old place That you laughed about ♪ ♪ Well, the names Have all changed ♪ ♪ Since you hung around ♪ ♪ But those dreams Have remained ♪ ♪ And they've turned around ♪ ♪ Who'd have thought They'd lead ya ♪ ♪ Who'd have thought They'd lead ya ♪ ♪ Back here Where we need ya? ♪ ♪ Back here Where we need ya? ♪ ♪ Yeah, we tease him a lot ♪ ♪ 'Cause we've got him On the spot ♪ ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Welcome back Welcome back ♪ ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Welcome back Welcome back ♪ ♪ Yeah, we tease him a lot ♪ ♪ Welcome back Welcome back ♪ ♪ 'Cause we've got him On the spot ♪ ♪ Welcome back Welcome back ♪ ♪ Yeah, we tease him a lot 'Cause we got him on the spot ♪ ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Welcome back Welcome back ♪ ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Welcome back Welcome back ♪ ♪ Welcome back ♪ OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
