 Honey, why don't we get a pet? You know we're not allowed to have pets in this apartment. No, I don't mean a dog or a cat. Why don't we get a bird? Did I ever tell you about the parrot my Aunt Eileen got? No. The only thing the parrot could say was, "Who is it?" So she brought the parrot home, and she went out to get some parrot food. While she was gone, the butcher comes to her door. Knocks on her door.

Says, "The butcher, the butcher!" The butcher has a heart attack, falls down right in front of the door. My aunt comes home, sees the butcher there, she says, "My God. Who is it?"

You're gonna have a baby... and the father is one of the Sweathogs? Yeah. Rosalie. So, uh, you gonna be, um, um, um, um, um... Mommy. Who's, uh... Who's, uh, gonna be the daddy? He knows who he is, and he can step forward himself. I'm sure he'll step forward. Heh. Why do I get involved with these kids? Why even talk to them? I might as well be talking to a stone wall. I am talking to a stone wall. Okay. Here's a shot. Here's a shot. Here's a shot. Here... Now watch this. Watch this. You're late. That's your fourth tardy this semester. Did you bring a note from your mommy? Boy, what an honor. In my class. All four Marx Brothers. Wacko, Stupo, Jerko and Dumb-o. Now, you clowns, come on, sit down. We save the laughs for later. I have something very serious that I would like to discuss today. I would like to talk about... responsibility. About you being accountable for your own actions. I'd like to talk about... Now, Washington, I know that you're only pretending to be asleep. Oh, no, I'm not, man. I-I'm sleeping. I can just tell it's gonna be another one of your boring speeches. Open your eyes, Washington... or I'm gonna clap out the erasers on your head. ♪ Rise and shine ♪ All right, forget serious. I'm gonna talk about hoods. All right. Yeah! Okay. As we all know, there are many different kinds of hoods. There is childhood... brotherhood, sisterhood, Robin Hood. Fatherhood! I got another great idea. We're gonna play a game. All right. Okay, now a simple game. I'm gonna say a word. Then I'm gonna point to somebody in the class, and you say the first word that comes to your head. Right? Simple. Baby. Darling. Sweetheart. Honey. We gotta stop meeting like this. New word, new word, new word. Pregnant. Uh, Camp Feldman. Camp Feldman? Yeah, it's where my sister went last summer. I wanna see all the boys after class. All the boys. We've got practice, man. We didn't do nothing. I'm glad you did that, Mr. Kotter, 'cause I have something to say about responsibility too. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm pregnant. Rosalie. I didn't know you went to Camp Feldman? And one of you guys is responsible. Well, I really would like to go on chatting all day, fellas, but I must catch a train. See you. I'll see you in church, Mr. Kotter. Uh... Rosalie? Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure, Arnold. Shoot. Rosalie... are you busy on Saturday? Why? You wanna get married? What would I wanna do that for? 'Cause... I like you... and I wanna make you honest. And I wanna give your baby a name. You know, Horshack's a very old and respected name. It means, "The cattle are dying." The cattle are dying? That's really sweet of you, Arnold, but... I wanna marry the father of my baby. Oh, yeah. Well, you think about it. At least if you married me, you wouldn't be "Hotsy" Totsy no more. I'd be "Hotsy" Horshack? Rosalie, uh... can you meet me here after your last class. I'd like you to come home with me tonight. Sure. And, uh... you can call me Hotsy. See you. The cattle are dying? I don't know where Julie is. She's supposed to be home by now. I mean, she should be here any minute. Oh, relax. Be a guest. This is my apartment. I figured. That's my window. Well, uh, why don't you sit down here on your couch? That's my table. That's the, uh, carpet on the floor there. Look... Mr. Kotter, you don't have to feel uncomfortable. I understand what you're trying to do. I know how hard it is for... a person of the older generation to cope with sex. And I really wanna thank you. Hi. Hi! Julie, uh, you've heard me speak of Rosalie Totsy? Heh. Sure. Nice to meet you Hotsy. Julie, um... can we have a little word alone, okay? Alone? In this apartment? Rosalie, why don't you listen to some music, huh? Here. You're cleared for takeoff. Julie, I'm glad you came in when you did because just... Oh, the lipstick. Yeah. That was really funny, just as you walked in... Hysterical. s Well, it was like a gratitude type of kiss. Uh, it was... She was, uh... Basically what she was doing was, um... thanking me because she's gonna have a baby. Oh? Yeah, well, um... you see, uh... She won't, uh... Julie, you don't believe that... Oh. No. But you just keep on talking. Julie, Rosalie's gonna have a baby, and the father's one of the boys in my class. And she won't tell me who it is. So I brought her here so you can do me a favor and find out. Come on, Julie, you gotta help me. I don't know what else to do. Why don't you talk to her parents? Because she trusts me not to. She says her parents will kill her. Especially her father. Reverend Totsy. Julie. Let us reminisce for a while. Return with me now to those thrilling days of yesteryear... Last yesteryear, my last birthday when you didn't have money to buy me a present. Oh. So, what did you do? Well... instead... you gave me this. "This card entitles the bearer to one giant favor." Heh. "Happy Birthday. Love, Julie." Aren't I cute? Well, I guess I'll just leave you two alone to talk. I'll, uh, take out the garbage. I already took out the garbage. I'll make new garbage. Rosalie, I'll be back in a minute! I'm gonna take out the garbage! So... This is our apartment. That's our window. Uh, I've already been through this with your husband. I've seen it all, Mrs. Kotter. Look, Rosalie, my husband told me about your problem. In this day and age, how did you ever get yourself in such a mess? Uh, what I mean is... haven't you ever heard of family planning? You can't plan a family in a '57 Chevy. Rosalie, just... how pregnant are you? I'm... I'm pretty pregnant. No. I'm looking for a number. Two months, three, four? Four. Really? You don't look it. Okay, two. Aren't you sure? What about three? You know, I was never very good at math, Mrs. Kotter. I, uh... I just want to get married and have my baby. And, uh... And I want the father to step forward because he loves me not because... Not because someone forced him into it. Hi. How we doing? Got to know each other yet? Hey. You need some more time? I'll make some more garbage. Wow. He's just as freaky at home as he is in school. She didn't learn nothing neither. Bye. I wanna know, and I wanna know now. Have you ever dated Rosalie Totsy? What was the question? You heard the question. What's the answer? Hey, Vinnie, tell him about Lo's Oriental. How The Ten Commandments was on the screen, and you and Hotsy was in the balcony breaking nine of 'em. All right. What about the balcony at Lo's Oriental? So maybe I exaggerated a little. Turkey. One of you is responsible. You ain't gonna pin this rap on me. I know my rights. This isn't a courtroom, Epstein. It is a classroom. And you don't have any rights. I wanna know, and I wanna know now. Have you ever dated Rosalie Totsy? I can't hear you. Yeah, yeah. I went out with Rosalie. But nothing ever happened. Nothing. Hey, it was the first time in my life that nothing ever happened. Hey, man, what about the time you told me you was at the Coney Island beach? You said you and Hotsy made an imprint in the sand that the lifeguards are still talking about. What about you, uh, Mr. Laughs? I believe... I'm allowed one phone call. Just tell me about you and Rosalie. There ain't nothing to tell, man. I ain't never even dated that chick. Then why did you say you did? Why not? I am deeply disappointed. You can't even trust a guy named Washington to tell you the truth. So I guess that settles it, huh? Congratulations, Horshack. You're the father. All right. Wait, wait. Wait a minute. You only went out with that chick last weekend. And I thought I was a fast worker. I'd like to thank everybody who voted for me. But I think you ought to know, Rosalie says I didn't do it. So nobody did it. I think we should put a candle in the window, because the last time this happened, three wise men came from the east. Okay, that's it. Somebody in here is lying. Now, I am gonna find out who, and I'm gonna find out... right now. Thanks for dropping in. Okay, Rosalie, you stay here. The rest of you girls back to the library. Well, how are we gonna learn anything? Listen, I don't mind if they stay. I've got nothing to hide. All the boys get up and get against the wall. Man. We didn't do anything. Get against the wall! Oh, man. Oh, please. Rosalie... I insist that you identify the father... and I insist that you do it right now. Bet they all denied it. Boy. Did they deny it. You're still denying it? Yeah. Well, uh... they all said nothing ever happened, then... I guess I'm not pregnant. What? Huh? Hey. Can she do that? Not pregnant? You're not pregnant. Rosalie, why did you tell me that you were? Mr. Kotter, do you have any idea what it's like going through life as... "Hotsy" Totsy? Being treated like you're easy when you ain't. Even you believed them. So, uh... that's when I decided getting even would be the best revenge. Now I got all these clowns on record. It's official. I ain't easy. I'm a lady. Arnold? Arnold? Huh? Uh, I-I-I wanna thank you for being so valiant while I was pregnant. You're a true gentleman. And, uh, if you're still free for Saturday, so am I. We can go to the airport. Alone this time. Who knows? Rosalie... I still don't understand one thing. Why? Just tell me why. Why did you involve me in this? Aw, that's easy, Mr. Kotter. Because you're always butting in where you don't belong. But thank you. Ah, yes. Used by a woman once again. And then just cast aside. Oh, Kotter. ♪ Welcome back ♪ ♪ Your dreams were Your ticket out ♪ Gabe, I've been thinking.
