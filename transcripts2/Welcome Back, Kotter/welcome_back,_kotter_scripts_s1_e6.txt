 Honey, why hasn't your mother ever liked me? She likes you, Julie, it's just she never was crazy about any girls I went out with. They were either too fat, too skinny, too short, too tall, too loud, too quiet. I finally found a girl that was exactly like my mother. I mean, how could she complain?

You. Hold it right there, mister. Me? What have you done with it? Hey, Mr. Woodman, I'm clean. I ain't got it. Aha. Got what, Epstein? Whatever, he ain't got it. Hey, look, I'm clean. Really, you can search me. Here. See, this is all I got on me. It's my good luck charm. Had it since birth. It's the first tooth I ever knocked out. Look into my eyes. [LAUGHTER] Hey, Mr. Kotter... You stole my chalk, Epstein. My yellow chalk. And that's my favorite of all my colors. Yellow is my favorite. Mr. Woodman, I am really surprised at you. Accusing Epstein of being a thief. Now, look at that face. Don't defend him, Kotter. I'm sick of their taunts. I'm sick of their contempt. I'm sick of their flaunting my authority. I'm sick of them. No doubt about it, the man is sick. Uh-huh. Reminds me of the girl's gym teacher they found in the shower talking to a volleyball. [BELL RINGS] Hey, yo, uh, Mr. Woodman, man, like, you know, the bell just rang. It's time for us to boogie. Well, then, boogie, you pack of howling baboons. Boogie. A boogie, boogie, boogie... Boogie till your livers fall out. Boogie. Mr. Woodman, uh, are you okay? You didn't have too much chipped beef in the cafeteria, did you? Forget about the chalk, you don't seem quite yourself. Kotter, I'm more myself than ever. Well, try being less yourself than ever. I mean, Mr. Woodman, a person is like a car. We have to be finely tuned. What are trying to say, Kotter? Mr. Woodman, you need a lube job. You gotta relax a little bit. You know, forget about Buchanan. Why don't you go out, have a few drinks, a nice dinner, some quiet conversation with friends? Good advice, Kotter. Thank you. What time? What time what? Well, that was a dinner invitation. What time shall I be there? How 'bout August? [DOOR BUZZING] Okay, now remember, years from now, we're gonna look back on this, and we won't laugh. [MOUTHED DIALOGUE] I bet you hoped I wouldn't come. That's true, isn't it? You didn't invite me, I invited myself and now that I'm here, you wish I'd leave, right? Well, it is getting late. Mr. Woodman, we are delighted that you could come. Mrs. Kotter, don't worry. I'll leave early. Let me take your coat. What are you gonna do with it? I'm just gonna hang it right here in the closet. I'll leave the door open so you can keep an eye on it the whole time. Gabe, why don't you make us a drink or two or six before dinner? Good idea. Come on, Mr. Woodman, I'll fix you a screwdriver. Tighten up what's ever loose. Well... in my entire career I've been invited to faculty members' homes for dinner only, uh, twice. The, uh, first time was during World War II. They wanted my meat ration points. The second time was, uh, just a few years ago, during the, uh, tuna-fish scare. We had tuna casserole and everyone waited for me to taste it first. What's for dinner? Tuna casserole. Just kidding, just kidding. Here. I made a joke. So, uh... You actually... live here? No. Here? No. We have a townhouse on Park Avenue. We just borrow this place from a struggling teacher and his wife when we wanna entertain. I had a place like this once. Oh? It burned. That's too bad, Mr. Woodman. But at least it made it easy for you to move. Who moved? I just stayed at the Y till the furniture cooled. That was a... A joke. KOTTER: It was a joke. BOTH: Oh! Mr. Woodman made a joke. Made a joke. [LAUGHING] You know, I'm beginning to relax. Uh, tell me, uh, Kotter, what's troubling you? Me? You wanna know what's troubling me, Mr. Woodman? Okay. I'm gonna tell you what's troubling me. You. You're troubling me. Oh. Uh, you think I made a fool of myself today, don't you? Well, it wasn't... Well, I... I did, Kotter, I did. And over what, huh? Chalk. Chalk, meaningless sticks of compressed dust. Dollar's worth of nothing. Zero. Null. Void! I'm not very well-liked, am I, Kotter? Why don't we start eating dinner now? What could it be, Kotter? What? What's the difference? You're still getting dinner. And I'll even taste it first. The, uh... The students like you. You've... You've got rapport, Kotter. But what do they think of me? Well, honestly... I-I really wanna know, Kotter. Well... Tell me, go ahead, tell me. Basically... I'll make it easier for you. I'll start. They think I'm ill-tempered and insensitive. That's a good start. Petty and tyrannical. Hostile. Unreasonable. Mean. Rotten. Rotten? Well, that tips it, Kotter. I don't have to sit here and be insulted by your wife. Mr. Woodman, please, I'm so sorry. Please, don't go. Well, it's, uh... [SIGHS] You're right. It's all true. I... I am rotten. No, no, you're not rotten. I mean, I would've stopped at petty and tyrannical. All you have to do is loosen up a little bit. Just stop and smell the roses. In Brooklyn? Well, stop and smell a few winos. Look, you have to get back to your first love, teaching. Now, you may have your weaknesses. But, Julie, this man is one terrific history teacher. You really think so, huh? The greatest. Nobody can teach about military history like this man right over here. I guess there was always something about a good war that cheered me up. It was probably seeing all those people with guns and knowing they're not in your neighborhood. [LAUGHS] You know, Gabe's right, Mr. Woodman. You should get back to teaching. Ridiculous. I wouldn't know where to start. I haven't taught a class in 10 years. Teach my class tomorrow. Oh, I couldn't. I couldn't. Come on. They're not gonna bite you. I have been bitten by Sweathogs on many occasions. I made another joke. KOTTER: Another joke. Another. First one your apartment was burning and the second was bitten by Sweathogs. Two jokes in one evening. Come on. Cheers. All right, I have a surprise for everybody today. Mr. Woodman has agreed to teach my class. [LAUGHTER] Him? Him? [HORSE LAUGH] Now, I'm going right over here to sit down, and I want everybody to think of me today as just another Sweathog. Okay, Kotter. No horseplay. Sit up straight. I've still got it. All right, boys and girls, take out your, uh, notebooks and pencils. What's the matter with you? You don't have to take notes? You want me to take notes? Okay, right, I'll take notes. Horshack. Horshack, lend me a pencil. Sorry, no loansies. Horshack. Mr. Kotter, I am surprised at you. Don't you know that you're supposed to come to class with two sharpened pencils in case one breaks? You sound like my mother. Mr. Kotter, there is no need to get surly. Well, you know, surly to bed, surly to rise. Uh, today, we'll, uh, discuss the Revolutionary War. Now, who can tell me where that war started? Mr. Washington? Right. What's the answer? Lexington and... Right. [CLEARS THROAT] Lexington Avenue. Probably here... Near... Probably near 129th Street by that barbecue, man. It's a tough neighborhood. A lot of wars went on over there. Wrong. The answer is Lexington and Concord. Where the colonists fired the shot heard round the world. [SMALL POP] Now, the redcoats came marching down the road, not suspecting that the colonists were lying in wait for them. Kotter, get up here and lie in wait for me. Did you want me to, uh, lie in wait any place special? Well, take cover behind the hill. Okay, I'm taking cover behind the hill. All right. Now, 1775. The scene: Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts. And the redcoats came marching down the road, not suspecting that the colonists were lying in wait for them. Oh! Oh, oh! Oh! Can I be a prisoner? [MOUTHING WORDS] I don't know, maybe... Maybe later. Fire at will, Kotter. Taxation without representation, huh? Huh? All right, take this. You treasonous Yankee dog. Argh! I surrender! And so on June 16, 1775, George Washington agreed to take command of the colonial army. Beautiful. Beautiful. Bravo. Bravo. [BELL RINGS] Mr. Woodman, I hate to admit it, but that was interesting, really. Yeah, really. You know, you look like the guy on the money. That was terrific, Mr. Woodman. Mr. Kotter doesn't do that many costume changes in class. Well, I'm glad you all enjoyed it. Wait'll you see the fun we have with World War II. Oh, you're coming back? Oh, that's great. It was great. It was really great. Really, it was great. Great. It was a pretty good speech, man. They love me, Kotter. Mr. Kotter, Mr. Ko... Mr. Kotter, why is he wearing Miss Fishbeck's hair? Mr. Woodman, you gotta do something. The Sweathogs just locked Todd Ludlow in a gym locker. And I don't know how long he can last in there with Epstein's socks. Do you hear her, Mr. Woodman? They locked Todd Ludlow in a locker. I've still got it. He's in a locker with Epstein's socks. They love me. I can see the headlines: "Vice principal wears wig while socks smother student." [♪♪♪] ♪ Welcome back ♪ WOODMAN: Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, children. Good morning, Mr. Kotter. Ah. Good morning, Mr. Woodman. And a beautiful morning it is. LAZARUS [OVER PA]: Good morning, students. This is Principal Lazarus. I'm addressing whoever has disconnected the bell. You have this first period to reconnect it. No questions asked. In the meantime, get to your classes. Ding dong. [LAUGHTER] In the classroom, come on. Oh, uh, Kotter? I, uh... I wanna thank you for letting me take your class yesterday and, uh, well, bless you, Kotter. Mr. Woodman, don't you think you should take me out a few times first? Ohh. Uh... When you're at that wedding, remember, the cha-cha is different than the mambo. It's one-two, one-two-three. One-two... [HORSE LAUGH] Epstein. Barbarino. What? What? Come over here. Come over here. What is this? Uh, we're on a junior achievement project for the telephone company. You guys, uh, wouldn't happen to know who disconnected the bell, would you? It's probably the same guy that stuck Todd Ludlow in my gym locker, you know. Part of the undesirable element here at Buchanan. Epstein, you are the president of the undesirable element here at Buchanan. Now go and reconnect that bell. Never judge by appearances Kotter. Appearances deceive, they delude. Now, you must learn to trust these children. Trust is the very foundation of good student-teacher relations. And remember, Kotter, there are no bad boys, just bad teachers. Run along now, boys. Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Woodman. Class is over! [WHOOPING] That wasn't the bell. Get back inside. Back inside. President William Claiborne who settled Maryland. William Penn who settled Pennsylvania. Okay, can anybody tell me who settled New Jersey? Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Is New Jersey settled? Arnold, New Jersey's been settled for more than 250 years. Ha! You never been to Newark on a Saturday night. [BOTH LAUGH] ALL: Boogie, boogie, boogie. [ALL LAUGHING] Hey, all right, come on. I know you'd rather be, uh, watching Mr. Woodman crash the Boston Tea Party. But some of us are here to learn. Who? Okay, I'm gonna get some of these names up on the board... Excuse me, I gotta boogie to my desk to get some chalk. ALL: Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. [LAUGHTER] Woodman's yellow chalk. All of Woodman's yellow chalk is in my desk. Well, we had to put it some place. Yeah and it'd break Uncle Woody's heart if he thought that we took it. So you want him to think that I took it? Sure, why not? All right, I wanna know who's responsible for taking that chalk and hiding it in my desk. All right, it was my idea. I took the chalk. I opened the desk drawer. And I stuck the chalk inside it. And I... [IMITATES SCRAPING] closed the drawer. [LAUGHTER] You guys really stick together, don't you? ALL: Mmm-hmm. All right, by tomorrow morning, from each and everyone of you, I want a 500-word essay... STUDENTS: Oh, man. On how to be a human being. You know, I don't believe this, I really don't. It's like The Exorcist or something. I think... I think Woodman has taken over his body. Hey, Woodman, you in there? I'm in here by myself, Barbarino. What is it, really, Mr. Kotter? Ever since we made nice with Uncle Woody you've been crawling up our backs. Hey, that's right, man. What's with you? Um, you... You jealous or what? BOY: Ooh. Me, jealous of, uh, Father Flanagan? All I know is you've been turning into a real louse. Yes, that's true, Mr. Kotter. Yeah. All right, quiet! That is it! Let's get this straight, all right?! This is a school! A school! You're in a school! And I am a schoolteacher. That means I am the boss. Do you understand that? [STATIC OVER PA] LAZARUS: I am still waiting to get my bell back. Ding dong. Saved by the bell. All right. All right. Let's go. Come on. Oh, man. Sit down. No one leaves until I say so. Sit down. Kotter, I wanna... You too. Sit down, Uncle Woody. All right, I am fed up. You understand that? I'm sick of all of you. Of your contempt, your arrogance, your disrespect. I know what you're trying to do. Well, it's not gonna work! Nobody is gonna make me crazy, understand that? Nobody's gonna make me crazy! I think we made him crazy. Kotter. Kotter, you gotta relax. I mean, loosen up. I'm not crazy. Have a few drinks, nice dinner, quiet conversation with friends. That is, if you have any left after that disgusting performance. You know, Kotter, you're beginning to sound a little like me be... Before I became a... A great guy. Mr. Woodman... how would you like to go back to being you? What for? I mean, I'm happy being not me. Yeah, but if you're not you, then I can't be me. And then I gotta be somebody, so I become you. How does it feel? Terrible. Look, I am a better teacher than I am a disciplinarian. But the school has gotta have a disciplinarian. I know being Mr. Woodman is a rotten job, but somebody's gotta do it. What's that, Kotter? What? That. What? It's the missing yellow chalk. Freeze. Freeze. You... You... You're all in it together, weren't you? And you too, Kotter. I don't suppose that you'd be interested in quieting down and conducting a calm, rational investigation. I am being totally calm. I am dealing with Sweathogs. And one approaches Sweathogs only with total iron-fisted authority and that includes a Sweathog disguised as a teacher. STUDENTS: Ooh. And now, Kotter, I want every stick of that chalk returned to my office with a written explanation of how it came to be in your desk drawer. And you will be assisted in this task by the members of your class. Hey, man... And now, you pack of howling baboons, go to your next class. Come on, boogie. [♪♪♪] Well, Kotter, I guess, uh... I guess I am really good at being Mr. Woodman, aren't I? You certainly are. You're the worst. You know, I really missed him. So did I. Welcome back, Mr. Woodman. Wipe that smile off your face, Kotter. Woodman's back in town. [♪♪♪] ♪ Your dreams Were your ticket out ♪ A guy walks into a bar. What guy? Whatever, a guy walks into a bar, orders two martinis. Right? You with me so far? Yeah, somebody I don't know is in a bar, and he orders. Two martinis. Drinks one martini, pours the second one in his breast pocket. From his pocket, you hear: [SLURPS] Orders two more martinis, drinks one, second one over here, you hear: [SLURPS] The bartender looks at this guy funny. I should imagine. This guy orders 10 martinis, drinks five, the other five in his breast pocket and you keep hearing: [SLURPS] The bartender's getting mad. He says, "All right, you, fella. You're a weirdo. Get outta here." Guy looks at the bartender, says: [SLURRING] "I don't have to leave this bar. "I am a citizen, and I pay taxes, and I'm gonna punch you right in the nose." And from his breast pocket a little mouse appears over the top and goes, "And that goes for your stupid cat too."
