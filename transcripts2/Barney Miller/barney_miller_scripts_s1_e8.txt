 Hey, Chano. Yeah? Look at this. A Japanese thermometer factory just went out of business. Yeah, how come? They found traces of swordfish in the mercury. If I don't get in there in two minutes, I'm going to faint. I've got four reports I need typed up. Wentworth is the best typist

 in this joint. Where is Wentworth? In the men's room. I've been waiting 20 minutes. I feel like I'm drowning. The stuff's in here. 12th Precinct, Sergeant Yemana. Hold it, please. Chano, it's the telephone company. The supervisor wants to report some obscene phone calls. Oh. Who is the supervisor? It's Miss Busch. You talk to her, huh?

 She asked for you. Oh, why does she always ask for me? You have a way with words. Line two. This whole business offends me. Hello, Miss Busch. Yes, this is Sergeant Amenguale speaking. I am fine. How are you? Good. Good, good. Yes, I've been going over the files and frankly, Miss Busch, we have enough disgusting material here to write a bestseller. What do you mean, "for example"? No, no, no. Well, you see, Miss Busch, no... I know it's official business, but if I was to read you an obscene phone call on the phone, this would be an obscene phone call. That's right, Miss Busch. Oh, you have traced one call? I see. Well, the next time you make a contact again, please get in touch with us right away. Yes, of course, I realize it must be very embarrassing for you. Yes. You have a very nice voice too, Miss Busch. Goodbye. Hey, hey, hey... No, no, no. The voice never matches the face. Yeah, it ain't fair, is it? Hey, Chano, what's a four-letter word for Oh... Oh, I'm sorry. Did you have to get in there? Only because I'm tidy. Wentworth? Yes? I've got four reports on that garage robbery from last week. Oh, what, you want me to file these? No, I'd like you to type them up first and then file them. Captain Miller, this was not my collar. I'm aware of that. Then why do I have to type it up? Because, Wentworth, we make no distinctions here between male and female. You're just another cop... who happens to be a good typist. It also happens, captain, that I fired expert at the Police Academy. Good. Then don't type them, shoot them. Yes, sir. I hate filling out forms. I thought when you did plainclothes, you did more than filling out forms. Oh, yeah, we do a lot of heroic stuff around here, but if we didn't fill out forms, nobody would ever know about it. I was better off downtown, writing parking tickets. At least I was near the windshields, where all the action was. You left your lipstick in the sink. Oh, yeah. How'd you know it was mine? None of us is left-handed. 12th Precinct, Detective Sergeant Amenguale speaking. Just a minute. Barney! We got a 10-30 in progress at a bank in the East Village. Pick up a car. We'll meet you downstairs. Fish, check out some weapons. Let's go, Nick. Hey, hey, hey, what about me? Stay here, answer the phones, and make sure that everything is, uh, neat. That's it! That's what? The four-letter word for This is what I came here for. Let me go with you. I can be very helpful. Don't push, Wentworth, don't push. There's liable to be shooting out there. Look, these men have worked together for years. They know they can depend on each other. It's always tough with somebody new. Especially when that somebody is a woman, huh? Being a woman has nothing to do with it. It's a matter of confidence. Look, we'll get to know you, you'll get to know us. Don't be so sensitive, Wentworth. Everybody thinks you're a lovely cop. What time do you want dinner? OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn Good morning. May I help you? Oh... uh, no, thank you. I'm a regular here. I'm Elizabeth Miller. I'm Barney's wife. Oh, he's not in. How do you do? I'm Detective Janice Wentworth. Oh, you're new. Oh, yeah, this is my fourth day. Oh, congratulations. Welcome to the old one-two. Oh, thank you very much. You're welcome. I have a lot of work. Excuse me. How is it going? Oh, coming up on 93 words a minute. If people knew that detective work was 90% paperwork, they'd never watch television. I guess not. Well, I'm very glad to see that Captain Miller's married. I didn't think he liked women. I beg your pardon? Oh, I mean, I think he likes women in all the old familiar places... The kitchen, the parlor, the bedroom. You know what I mean? Not really. I think it's safe to say that Captain Miller likes women almost anywhere he finds them. Except on the police force. Did he say that? No... He didn't have to. I've been typing and filing, filing and typing, and just sitting around waiting to do something useful, and the first 10-30 that comes in, I get pushed aside and told to mind the store. 10-30? That's an armed robbery in progress? That's right. Is that where Barney went? That's right. Yemana and Amenguale went as a team, and I'm supposed to go as a team with Fish, but Captain Miller went instead. Boy, I really wish he hadn't done that. So do I. Well, see, you're a woman. You understand what it is to be a second-class citizen. How long have they been gone? Oh, Mrs. Miller, don't worry. No, no, these men have been working together for years. They have a lot of confidence in each other. I'm sure that they just stopped off for a sandwich. You have no idea how hungry you can get after a shoot-out. It's the thrill of being alive. Your turn at the typewriter, Fish. Hi, honey. Uh, Nick, will you check this back in for me? Yeah, sure. Well, how'd it go? Oh, fine. I heard the reports over the dispatcher. There was some shooting, huh? Uh, a little bit. Nothing serious. Anybody get hit? Just the suspect, but he's going to be all right. Any messages? Excuse me? Any messages? Uh, yes, yes, sir. There was a call from your wife. And a Miss Busch from the phone company wants you to call her back. Oh, sound serious? Yeah, I think so. She was breathing heavy. How'd everything go around here? Oh, fine. I answered all the phones, filled out all the forms. I even washed the coffee cups. Dinner ready? Oh... I didn't think you heard that. What's the matter, Bernice? Why do you have to listen to the police calls all the time? Why don't you watch television and iron like a normal woman? Nothing happened. Of course there was some shooting. Some guy tried to hold up a bank. Now, you know we don't allow a thing like that. Yes, Miss Busch. Yes, it's nice to hear your voice again too. You have a call from him traced to him now? What's the address of the phone booth? Okay. I'm on my way right now. Thank you. Me? Well, I've been described as attractive. No, Miss Busch, no mustache. Goodbye. Would you like me to go with you? Well, not now, thank you. I didn't think so. But maybe next time. Oh, sure. This is a brochure from our travel agent about crossing on the SS France. It costs about $4,000, one-way. Now, these are the three best hotels in Paris. The Plaza Athenee, the Bristol, and the Carillon. The villa in the South of France costs $1250 a week. Then we fly back to Paris and then back to New York. That makes the whole thing cost about $26,000 for six weeks. Can we afford it? No. Okay. How about taking me to lunch? You didn't have to go through all that just to get me to take you to lunch. I thought you'd be more excited about the idea if you thought that I'd saved you $26,000. That's very considerate of you. Listen, you give up three more trips like that, we're on easy street. Why'd you really come down? I just wanted to see you. I spent a very meaningful morning with the other tenants of the building discussing rent controls and building repairs, and then I bought David a pair of sneakers, and then I read in the newspaper about a policeman getting killed in a bank robbery in Massachusetts, and I just had this overpowering desire to have lunch with you. I see. Besides, at the group therapy session for law enforcement wives, they suggested all this. I thought they dealt with a more direct approach. This week, it's humor. Some imaginative joke or bright saying. Instead of sending it to the news and getting five dollars, you send it to your husband and you get a lunch. You got it. Thank you. Bernice, I've got to go. I don't have time to hear a joke. I can't take you to lunch. I don't care what the group therapy session said. I already had lunch. I'll see you at home tonight. Of course I still love you. What else have I got to do? Goodbye. How long have you been married, Fish? I don't know. 25, 35 years. I don't think I'll get married. Men have no respect for women. That's true. 12th Precinct, Wentworth. Really, where? All right, I got it. We're on our way. What've we got? What is it? Captain Miller. Excuse me, Captain Miller. A guy just checked into the Fremont Hotel, 11th Avenue. Clerk recognized him as an armed robbery suspect from an APB circular. Where's Chano? He's down on a call. Yemana? He's still at the armory and Wojciehowicz and Harris are still down at narcotics and won't be back until the end of the week. I know, Wentworth, I know. You think you can handle it yourself? I can take a patrolman. No, no, no, no, no. No uniforms. I'll go with you myself. Please, Captain Miller. You're going to have to let me go sometime. What do you say, Fish? I'd like to, Barney, but it would kill Bernice if she found out I died in the company of another woman. Phil, that is just terrible. Okay, Wentworth, come on. But I'm driving. Right. 12th Precinct, Sergeant Yemana. Yes, sir. A stolen car? What kind of car, Mr. Ravelli? A Studebaker. Will you describe the car, please? Black fenders... Silver doors... Green hood... Polka-dot seat covers... And a monkey-fur dashboard. Maybe it wasn't stolen. Maybe it ran away. Mr. Ravelli, will you hold it a minute? I've got to find a pencil. Okay, go ahead. All right, Mr. Hackman. If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say will be held against you. And in your case, with the record you got at the phone company, everything you say will probably be held against you. We've got a nice little booth here for you. If you can't afford an attorney, we will supply one for you at no cost to yourself. Do you understand? I don't have anything to say. That'll be a nice change for you. Call your insurance company. Yeah. Don't mention it. Oh, my God... I ate my eraser. That group therapy for law enforcement wives, it's a wonderful thing. Oh, yeah? Yeah, they have a free and open discussion for about an hour, a little lunch, an occasional new hat, an extorted promise of two weeks in Martha's Vineyard next summer. My wife and I have never been closer. An occasional phone call wouldn't hurt, either. You're absolutely right. Is that, uh... Charles Hackman... The Voice of Experience. Oh, sir? Uh, sir? Sir, excuse me. I don't mean to be personal, but did I understand you to say over there that your wife is going through therapy? Yeah, you ought to try it yourself. Yeah, I did a couple of weeks ago. Didn't work? Well, I just never got to see the doctor. See, when I called the nurse to make the appointment, I, uh... well, you know what happened. You know, the court is going to insist on some kind of therapy. Yeah, I suppose so. You see, I always... Mr. Hackman, will you step out, please? Step right over there to that desk there. Sir, thank you for your concern. Pleasure talking to you. I don't hear that very often. Mr. Hackman, just out of curiosity, but these ladies that you talk to on the telephone, you ever try to make personal contact with them? Well, I have, on occasion, yeah, but it's usually kind of disappointing. You know, the voice never matches the face. I know what you mean. All right, Mr. Hackman, what's your address? I live at 675 East Lansing Street. And where do you work? I work at home. I write verses, you know, for greeting cards. Oh, really? You mean like "Merry Christmas," "Happy New Year," "Get Well Soon"? Yeah. It's ironic, isn't it? Maybe you ought to drop yourself a card. Right. What's your phone number? I don't have a phone. You're kidding? Well, if I had a phone, then I'd never get any work done. All right, stand right there, and keep it there. No more nonsense. Can't I... You'll get your phone call. You'll get your lawyer. You cooperate with us, we cooperate with you. Wentworth? Yeah. Take it easy. Take it easy. What the hell's the matter with her? It's her first arrest. We got him. We got him. Without exchanging a shot, Captain Miller, we got him. I got him, Barney. There he is. He's right there. Good job. Good job. You want to hear a report? I'd like to hear a report, but I'd like to hear it from Fish. Yemana, I think Detective Wentworth could use a cup of coffee. I think she could use a keeper. Shut up. How do you like it? I love it. Beats all hell out of traffic control. No, I mean the coffee. Yeah, black. No sugar, no cream. Black, just black. You got it. Good for you. We drove to the Fremont Hotel... And very slowly, I might add. Right, and she kept saying, "Faster, faster." Yeah. We determined that the suspect, Earl Schmidt, was in room 504... Fifth floor... corner room. Right. I took up a position in the hall and Detective Wentworth... Said, "Why don't I make out like I'm the maid and you get on the other side of the door?" Right. So... I knocked on the door and I go, "Maid!" "Maid, would you like your bed... "Turned down?" So the door opens and I move in the room and draw my revolver. I go, "Police! Freeze! Freeze!" The suspect had a gun, which he immediately threw out of the window. Then what happened? Then I dropped to my knees and begged her not to shoot me. Here's your coffee. Black, no sugar. Thanks, Yemana. You're okay. Well, he's your collar, Wentworth. I don't suppose you'll object to filling out this report? No, sir. This one is going to be a pleasure! Get his cuffs off. And put them on her. All right, Schmidt. Park it. She's high as a kite. You're telling me. I took the elevator, she took the stairs. She beat me to the fifth floor. That's... that's a very efficient lady. Combat fever. I've seen it before. Okay, Mr. Hackman, you've got one phone call. All right, Schmidt, this is it. Let's have your whole name. Horace Percival Schmidt. I thought your name was Earl. That's what I tell everybody else, but I ain't keeping nothing from you. 12th Precinct, Sergeant Yemana. Hang on. Wentworth, it's for you. Yeah, yeah. Wentworth. What did you say? Yemana, trace this call. Okay. You've got some nerve talking to a police officer like that. Yes, the trial is next week, Miss Busch. Right. Right. If the District Attorney's office needs you to testify, they will be in touch with you. Oh, yes, I will be there. Well... Well, I'm six-foot-one, about 170 pounds, brown eyes, black hair, slightly receding hairline. You too, Miss Busch? Wentworth? Yes, sir. Can I see you in my office a minute? Sure, Barney. Sit down. I'm going out on an assignment with Yemana this morning, and with Chano this afternoon. Hey, you're getting real popular. Just doing my job. You've been transferred, Wentworth. Effective tomorrow. Transferred? Yeah. Why? Some kind of rotation program, initiating more women into the field, giving them a broader variety of experience. I thought I was doing real well here. You did a great job. Well, did you tell them that? Of course I did. It's just another reason why they want to move you around. But that's not fair. The men and I, we get along good. They have confidence in me. I don't want to go somewhere, start all over with a bunch of rookies. I appreciate that. So where are they going to send me? Youth House. Youth House? Oh, Youth House? What? Baby-sitting? It's temporary. Well, it stinks. I'm not going. You have no choice. You are going to go where they send you, like the rest of us. Look, I felt the same way when they transferred me here. Gee... Just when everything was going so great. When did you say I'm supposed to leave? Tomorrow. Okay, I better go clean out my desk drawer. It was very nice working with you, captain. See you around. Wentworth, I hope you won't take offense, but I still think you're a lovely cop. Oh... Oh, excuse me. I thought this was the powder room. Wentworth! Hey! Hey! I heard the old one-two was in trouble, so I thought I'd come down and give you a hand. Hey, and not a moment too soon. No kidding. We stopped typing two weeks ago out of respect for your leaving. That's right. No one's washed a thing around here, either. Yeah, there are green things growing out of the coffee cups. Hey, Wentworth. Barney... How are you? All right. How's Youth House? Oh, I'm moved. I moved to a more sophisticated house. I want you to know, I've been transferred to Vice. Hey... Oh, I used to love that line of work, many years ago. Hi, everybody. Hi, Barney. Oh, look who's here. It's nice to see you. Uh, Barney, could I talk to you for just a minute please? Sure. What's up? Could we discuss it in your office? Go ahead. I just finished another group therapy session. Oh... Last week, it was humor. What's the approach this week? Sex. No calls.
