 There, you're all set. You won't have any trouble with that phone anymore. You don't fix toilets, do you? Only if there's a phone in it. Could be... It won't flush. Are you really a detective? Yeah, why? I've never seen a Japanese cop before. You ever been in Tokyo? Yeah, flew over it during the war. I'll bet you were an officer.

 Colonel. How did you know? I know a lot of telephone repairmen. It just seems to me if it's your assignment, you've got to fill out the report. You think you're fooling them. They know where I am. Come on, come on. They find you. I'm telling you. You don't know them as well as I do. All this skipping around town is a waste of time. Mr. Schuster? Oh, God. Why do you come up on people like that?

 I'm sorry. I'm Captain Miller. That's the way they got Freedman, in a laundromat... Snuck up behind him and pushed him into a dryer. They threw in seven quarters. The coroner said two would have been enough to kill him. I don't want to go like that. Freedman? He was the other accountant for the syndicate. Sweet man... Kept a great set of books, a wife, three kids, a house all paid for. Two laundromats. All right, take it easy. We're not going to let anything happen to you, Mr. Schuster. That's why they moved you here. Oh, yeah, sure, sure. That's what they told me when they took me to the Bronx and Queens and Staten Island. Any problems, Chano? No, no problems, Barney. Picked him up at the 51st precinct near Van Cortland Park... Nice easy trip, no problems. Nobody saw us, quiet. I'm not going to make it through the morning. Mr. Schuster, you're going to be okay. Look, the syndicate, they're just another bunch of hoods. They're not supermen. Oh, sure, sure. Then why am I the last witness? Coincidence. Coincidence? Freedman's secretary drowned in the ocean... A beautiful swimmer. Accident. Accident, huh? Steinmentz, Steinmentz, a vice-president... Took a two-week vacation, and that was a year ago. Maybe he's having a good time. What about me? So far, you're okay, right? Oh, sure, because my car was only a warning. What happened? They steal your car? Blew it up in front of my house... You're not going to get hurt, Mr. Schuster. And it was a loaner... See? And on top of having my life threatened, a garage is suing me. What's the matter? You got no insurance? Are you kidding? My mother's going to be a rich lady in a couple of days. I got double indemnity. Then let her pay for the car. Very funny, very funny. I didn't know Orientals had a sense of humor. Are you kidding? We invented gunpowder. Rest assured, Mr. Schuster, we're going to take good care of you. The Crime Commission is very anxious for your testimony, so relax. We're not going to let anything happen to you. 12th precinct, Yemana. They don't even know you're here. Mr. Schuster, it's for you. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn What did I tell you? I'm not here five minutes, and they know already. Uh... We don't have a Schuster. We have a Foster and a Brewster, but no Schuster. Yeah, don't mention it. Well, what, what? He said "excuse the call." That's it. I'm finished. I'm as good as dead. 12th precinct, Detective Sergeant Amenguale speaking. Okay, what's the information? Try not to worry, Mr. Schuster. But they know where I am already. That doesn't change anything. Nobody's going to get at you. In the next 24 hours, you're going to have more cops around you than you've got hair on your head. Wonderful. It's just an expression. I know what you mean, but what about after the next 24 hours? What then? We're never further away than your nearest phone. That's an expression, too, Mr. Schuster. Wojciehowicz, would you make Mr. Schuster as comfortable as possible? Yeah, sure. Right this way. We got it all tidied up for you. Okay, thanks a lot. Yeah, I'll see what I can do. Hey, Barney, how much money we got in petty cash, huh? I don't know, 30, 40 bucks. What do you need? Oh, look, I've been working on a buy for over two months now, and it's going down tonight, so what happens? Those over there in Narcotics tell me all their money is allocated. We've got enough to do around here. Let them take care of it. Barney, what are you talking about, man? You know all the work I put into this all the time. This is my bust, man. I'm sorry. It's just that I know the people, man. I know the places. It's in my neighborhood, Barney. Narcotics is just going to mess it up, and if they don't mess it up, they're going to take the credit. What do you want me to do about it? Well, could you lend me 3500 dollars? I'll pay you back tomorrow, man. I don't think I have the change. Come on, come on, man, this is clean, man. There's no problem... Forget it, Chano. Let Narcotics handle it. What? I just called you a name in Spanish. What? I don't think you'd care to hear it in English, so... Look who we just picked up for shoplifting... Dr. Strangelove. You know something? You simply have no class, Kogan. That's why you're still a private. We have no privates on the police force. Marty, when are you going to learn you can't take things that belong to other people? Why would I take something that belonged to me? Harris, would you do the honors? Okay, over here, Marty. I see you rented my room. Hey, this is very nice, very nice. You've got good taste, Marty. It was all a mistake. I was just comparison-shopping. And you walked out the door with it. Well, I wanted to get another opinion. You know, cab drivers know more about luggage than anyone? What do you need stuff like this for anyway? Well, I'm going away. You ain't kidding. You're going to be gone a long time too. Ho, ho, ho. Who's that? Oh, that's Marty. He's a regular here. You didn't even frisk him. To tell you the truth, I didn't have the nerve. That's just the kind of guy they would send up here to kill me, somebody you don't suspect. Marty? Marty's not going to kill you... Take you to dinner, maybe. Hey, Fish... Huh? How much money you got in the bank? None of your business. Hey, look, Fish, $950 is all I got in the world, man. I need $2500 more. I'll give it back to you tomorrow. You got me at a bad time. What happened? I'm poor. Fish, this is just front money, man. I'm going to make a bust. I can't take any chances. I've got to pay my income tax in the next few weeks. Why don't you take it out of the bank now, get used to being without it, huh? Hey, anybody order lunch yet? Tongue on rye. Not from me, from Grossman's. No, I didn't. I guess I've got to do it myself, huh? Tongue on rye. Barney, we're calling for sandwiches. Mr. Schuster, we're calling Grossman's Delicatessen for sandwiches. You want something? Are you kidding? I wouldn't put anything in my mouth I didn't cook with my own hands first. Burnside, the bag man... Poison in his toothpaste. They found him in the bathroom with a swollen tongue. On rye. We always order sandwiches from Grossman's, Mr. Schuster. Tell you what. I'll have an officer go out and pick it up. All right? How about that? I don't want any. All right. I'll take roast beef. Excuse me a moment. Captain, may I see you privately? Come on inside. Who else wants something? Ron? Yeah, short ribs. Short ribs? Fish, what do you want? Hot pastrami on rye and a side order of lemon. What can I do for you, Marty? Well, captain, I have never tried to use my influence with you to get special consideration before, but I would really appreciate it if you would try to do something about this unfortunate incident. What's so special about this one? Well... I'm getting married. Really? Mm-hmm. Who's the lucky... person? Her name is Gertrude Sax. No kidding. Gertrude has... She has marvelous instincts, and she possesses those wonderful qualities that my mother had. However... she is older. She's older than you. Older than my mother. How old is she? Seventy-four. I see. I knew it. You've lost respect for me because I'm marrying for money. It's none of my business what you do, Marty, as long as it's not against the law. Oh, but... but Barney, it would be very embarrassing if she found out about this. Please, captain. All right, I'll see what I can do. I won't book you, but I'm going to have to hold you. Just a police expression. Harris, hold that wrap sheet on Marty. We're going to negotiate a settlement out of court. Keep him on ice? Yeah, temporarily. Now, Marty, I'm doing a favor for you. I want you to do something for me. Mm-hmm. That's Mr. Schuster in there. Talk to him, keep his mind off his troubles. What did he do? It's a secret. What do I get if I find out? Killed. Barney, look at this. I got $325 from Fish, $524 from Wojo, $475 from Harris, $373 from Yemana, $950 from me, and $40 from petty cash. Now, that all adds up to $2,686. 87. He's right. Thanks. Don't mention it. Anyway, Barney, all we need is $813 more. How about that? You really want to make this bust? Barney, this guy pushes to kids in schools, man. All right, come on in. I'll give you a check. Fantastic, man! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to go to the bank. I'm going to cash these checks, and I'm going to have your money back by midnight. You better. Cheer up, Mr. Schuster. Things could be a lot worse. Yeah, how? Have you ever seen Gertrude Sax? Here's your sandwiches from Grossman's. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. All right, short ribs. Pastrami. Barney, got your sandwich. Tongue on rye. Here you go. Hey, Marty, you want something? Have you got anything light? Yeah, I've got... chicken liver and salami on an onion roll. That's disgusting. Mr. Schuster, I ordered an extra sandwich, a corned beef... I wouldn't touch it. They're great sandwiches. That's what they told Kleinerman, the auditor, when they had him stashed in that hotel in Chicago. Scrambled eggs... He was dead before he could put his fork down. You know what the police found out? Someone had injected poison into the eggshell with a hypodermic needle. You know how easy it would be to do the same thing with chopped liver, corned beef, bread, mustard? You're letting your imagination run away with you, Mr. Schuster. Right. Here's your sandwiches from Grossman's. Call the hospital! Come on, get going. You've got to have your stomach pumped. Stomach... Come on. Okay. All right, but I feel all right, Barn, really, I feel... You're lucky. Come on. Harris, get a car. Get him over to the hospital. Come on, let's go. Hospital? What are they going to do to me over there? Whatever they have to do. Come on. Kogan, do me a favor. Get this stuff over to the lab, get it analyzed, then send a report directly to the hospital and call me. Come on, come on, go. Nobody downstairs paid any attention to him. You know, a guy dressed in a cop's uniform in the middle of a change of shift. What did I tell you? You wouldn't listen to me. Shut up, Schuster. How the hell did they find out? Wojo called Grossman's from here. Oh, my God. What? There was a telephone repairman here this morning. He... he fixed my phone. I'll bet he did. I'm sorry, Barney. They knew Schuster was coming here before we did. They had us pretty good. Hi, everybody, hi. What's new? Who's that? My God, the way things are today, it's liable to be the chief of police. What happened? We... had a little trouble. What's up? Well, it's nothing important. It's okay. It's taxes. I need your checks and your... and your stubs and your receipts. All right, top drawer in my desk. Okay. All right. Let's make the best of a bad situation. Get the dispatcher to call Harris in the car. Have him check Wojo into the hospital under the name Alan Schuster... Right. And put him on the critical list. We'll let our friends think they got away with something... And call downstairs. Tell them nobody comes up here that doesn't belong up here. Right. 12th precinct, Yemana. Barney, a manager of some department store wants to talk to you. I can't talk to him now. Barney? All right, I'll take it inside. Line two. That was supposed to be me who got poisoned, you know that? Why would anyone want to poison you? Because I know too much. My God, if one got killed because they knew too much, I'd have been dead years ago. What do you do? I'm getting married. I mean for a living. I'm getting married. I've never been married myself. I don't know, for some reason, girls don't interest me. I guess my head is always too much into business, you know, ambition, making money, being a big shot. My mother used to say to me, "Alan, Alan, meet a nice girl, meet a nice girl," but... I don't know, I always had more fun with the fellas... Not that I never met a lot of nice girls, and I, actually, I was engaged twice, but... every time it came time to make the big step, I thought, "Maybe I'm making a mistake," you know? I mean, you're liable to make a commitment, and then... and then when you least expect it, like a bolt out of the blue, somebody comes around the corner and..."wham." Wham. Thank you, I appreciate it. He'll appreciate it, too. He's getting married, you know. Yeah, I'll tell him. Thank you. Well, at least Marty's off the hook. Are you allowed to deduct for your shoes? Only those with gum soles. I notice you didn't buy any new bullets last year. I haven't used the old ones yet. Oh... can I deduct them again? Can I depreciate them? Whatever. I guess I didn't pick a very good time to come down and discuss taxes. When it comes to discussing taxes, there's no such thing as a good time. Hmm. I know it's none of my business, Barney, but I really don't think you have any right to blame yourself for what happened. What I'm trying to do is reconcile myself to the fact that I made an amateur's mistake, and I'm supposed to be a professional. What? Harris just called from the hospital, Barney. They're pumping Wojo's stomach. They say he's going to be okay. What about the lab report? The sandwiches were loaded with arsenic. Arsenic? You sure Wojo's all right? They're watching him closely, but so far, he's fine. Thanks. Have you been seeing another woman? I don't remember. Why? There's a check stub here that says $34 for roses. It's an Italian restaurant. I took the boys to lunch. I thought it was something like that. I just didn't want you to think I was taking you for granted. I appreciate it. Open it up, Nick. Yeah. Marty, I just spoke to the department store. They're willing to accept the fact that you intended to buy the luggage, so get over there, give them the money, and they'll drop the charges. Well, they're really very expensive bags. I don't think I can afford them. What do you think? They go with your shoes. Bon voyage. Thank you. Uh... good luck. I don't suppose we'll be seeing each other again. I probably won't be seeing anybody again. Check in, Marty. I want to know what happens. Yes, captain. Uh... Goodbye. I really enjoyed our... brief encounter. Likewise. Mr. Schuster, are you a Scorpio? Yeah. Oh, God, I knew it. Well, I guess I'd better be getting home. Oh, I won't be... I won't be home for supper. Oh, maybe I'll go out. With whom? Haven't made up my mind yet. When you do, let me know. I appreciate that. Good night. Good night. Good night, Fish. Good night, Elizabeth. Night, Nick. Good night, Liz. Fine woman. You know, I get a kick seeing her doing little things like that for you all the time. I'll send Bernice over to watch how she does that, if you don't mind. Well, he's dead. What? Wojo? No, Schuster. I let a few rumors leak out. It's right here on the second page. Check it out. You... "An unconfirmed rumor from an undisclosed source... "Alan Schuster, a State witness scheduled to appear today "before the Crime Commission... "Brought to an East Side hospital... "Critical condition... "Overdose... undisclosed... Died this morning at 5:15 a.m." Perfect. Sorry to see you go, Mr. Schuster. Did they say anything nice about me? Uh, not really. Of course, they don't know you like we do. How's Wojo? Sick as a dog, but he's going to be okay. Doctor said a dude with an ordinary constitution would have cashed it in. He could eat a desk. All right, Mr. Schuster, get ready to travel. Harris, you and Fish take him over to city hall and... All right. Turn him over to the Crime Commission. Okay, Schuster. No, no handcuffs. You'll ride in the back with me. Try to act as if you're just another one of the detectives in this squad, huh? How do I do that? Oh, just keep looking at me with admiration and respect. Hmm. Hey, how you doing, Barney? Hi, guys. Hey, Chano. Did you make the bust? Oh, yeah, sure, I made it, nice and easy, nothing to it, got them with all the stuff. Very good. Where's my money? Uh... I ain't got it. What do you mean, you ain't got it? Quick, someone take my gun away. What happened? Barney, I walked into the place, right? Met the contact, gave him the money. He gave me the stuff. I pull out my piece and say, "Freeze hands in the air." Then all of a sudden from behind me, I hear somebody else say, "Freeze, hands in the air." You mean you got ripped off? Yeah, by the FBI. FBI? FBI? Yeah, the FBI. You know, the guys with the ties. They had their own bust going. What I am going to... They confiscated the money as evidence. Well, okay. For crying out loud. I could've lost that money at the track myself. I didn't need your help. All right, take it easy, take it easy. We'll all get our money back... Yeah. In five or six months. Wait till Wojo hears about it. He's not going to be too happy about pulling through. You can give me a note for my tailor, huh? Look, if you... If you don't get the money back, I know a way you could take it off your taxes. Thanks, Mr. Schuster, but no thanks. 12th precinct, Captain Miller. Wait, wait. Take it easy. I can't understand you. Stop crying. Mr. Schuster's not dead. No, he's not. He just went over to testify before the Commission. Now, will you stop getting hysterical? Is it his mother? It's Marty. Just take it easy, will you, please? Relax. Okay, okay. "The Commission has expressed its gratitude "to the police commissioner "for his cooperation "and their satisfaction with the outcome of the hearings." Hey, hey. Nice. They got them all pretty good, huh? Hey, what did Schuster get? Uh, doesn't say, but a cooperative witness, probably one to ten. With good behavior, he'll probably be out by the end of the fiscal year. Hey, all right! Hi, guys. How are you feeling? I'm fine, I'm fine. My stomach's good. That's great. I'm not so sure about my wallet. You're a lucky man. Yeah, yeah, I guess so. The doctor said it was because I had a tolerance for arsenic. From what? Fruits and vegetables. He said there was enough arsenic in there to kill a horse, but not a human being. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
