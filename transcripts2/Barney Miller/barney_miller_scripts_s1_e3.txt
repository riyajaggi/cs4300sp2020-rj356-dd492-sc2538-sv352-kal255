 Hey, Engine Room? Hey, what's the matter with you guys? It's 26 degrees up here. Hey, I wasn't meant for this type of temperature, baby. Tell him my blood is turning to slush. Hey, don't give me "energy crisis," man. How'd you like it if we quit and left your loved ones unprotected? Very well put. Hey, baby, it is cold up here.

 12th Precinct, Nanook speaking. Let me have the address. Yeah, well, if you don't get some heat up here, we're going to start breaking up the furniture and burning it. Bye. The kid that stuck up that liquor store the other day, the owner thinks he recognized him. We better check it out. Okay. There's six inches of snow in the streets. It's freezing out there. It's worse in here. Now I know why a penguin walks so funny.

 Pour me a cup of coffee, will you? Cream and sugar? It doesn't matter. I'm going to sit in it. Hey, you want to see something funny? Come in the toilet. Hey, what have you been doing? Writing on the walls again? No, the water in the sink is frozen, and a bunch of ants are crossing the ice, and they're slipping and falling all over the place. Come on, it's funny as hell. Hey, man, you got a weird sense of humor, you know that? What's going on around here? You'd think in this kind of weather, business would be slow. The armored car drivers and guards are still on strike. Money's piling up faster in the stores than garbage in the streets. Burglaries, armed robberies, aggravated assaults... Yeah, and every dude with a gun or a knife or a pointed stick is out there trying to seek his fortune. What a civilization, huh? Yeah. Okay, come on. Stand over there. What do we got here? A flasher, exposing himself at a bus stop. In this weather? Did you ever hear anything so disgusting? Hey, man, it's 10 degrees out there. Tell me about it. Some filthy habit, huh? Pervert, degenerate... That's me, A-number-one. Okay, Mr. Farber, you've got one phone call. Would you make a phone call if you were me? What am I supposed to do, brag about it? Maybe you better call a lawyer. I am a lawyer. Then you better call a doctor. What for? I don't need a doctor. I need an executioner. Okay, Mr. Farber, do you want to step into the cage, please? Oh, and keep your hands away from your coat, huh? Good. Lock me up. Keep me away from decent people. Take it easy, Mr. Farber. Everything is going to be all right. Sure, Mr. Pollyanna. You think this is like giving up smoking? I've been to the finest medical minds in the world, and they all tell me the same thing... "Farber, you're filthy. It's that simple." Uh, Chano... call Bellevue. Tell them we've got a prune danish to go. Oh, yeah. Put it over there on the desk. Hey, Barn, wait till you see what we got here. Siegel's Department Store hasn't been able to make a deposit for a week, so they asked us to keep their receipts till morning. I said okay. Is it okay? Wojciehowicz, we're working on a half-shift. We can't baby-sit somebody's payroll. An employee told Mr. Siegel he heard they were being set up for a rip-off. They'd like to avoid trouble, Barney. Yeah, I've never seen so much money in my whole life. Take a look. ♪ Happy birthday To me ♪ ♪ Happy birthday To me ♪♪ How much is in there? 216,480-odd dollars. Oh... "80-odd." Aren't you sure? Well, when you're loaded, what's a few bucks, more or less? That is "more..." "Less" is what I take home every week. Somebody put it in the safe. I got it. I signed for it. All right, then it's your responsibility, but get at it. We've got a lot of work to do. You know what? The people at the bus stop called me a "sickie." Sticks and stones, Mr. Farber. That's a very old model. You're not kidding. They don't make them like they used to. What's the combination of this thing? I forget it again. One to the left, two to the right, three to the left, four to the right. That's the way to do the "varsity drag."

Miss Sanchez. Right. We've got a patient for you here at the 12th Precinct. Yeah. Yes, miss. A male Caucasian, between 40 and 50 years old. Yes, miss. Yeah, indecent exposure. Mm-hmm, tonight at a bus stop. That's right, in the snow. Can you believe that, Miss Sanchez? I can't understand what makes a guy do something like that. No kidding. Rejection when he was a baby? No kidding. Breast feeding? No kidding. Me? No, I was a bottle baby. Sure. I would remember something like that. No kidding. Do you like dancing too, Miss Sanchez? Hey, why don't you let me give you a hand with that? I don't need no help. My responsibility. I mean... It's my money, sort of. Till tomorrow morning, anyway. Live, baby. Hey, come on, Yemana. We better check out that liquor store heist, huh? It'll be nice to get outside, where it's warm. Yeah, okay, Miss Sanchez, I will have the forms for you. Right. Goodbye. Hey, Fish, you wouldn't believe what makes a guy like that do what he does, man. It's the weather. When it's damp and cold, people get depressed, irritable, and unpleasant. In the winter, Scandinavia has more lunatics per capita than any other country in the world. No kidding. Bernice is Scandinavian, but only on her mother's side. She usually cheers up around... the middle of February. Fish? Yeah? Come in my office a minute, will you? Uh, Chano... Hmm? Did you call Bellevue? Yeah, I got in touch with them. Excuse me. May I show you something? I'd rather you didn't, if you don't mind. There was a time when, if you wanted someone to notice you, all you had to show them was a little courtesy. Yeah. How about the night shift? Are they going to make it? I don't think so. The guys who live in Long Island can't get to Manhattan. Well, that means that the guys who live in Manhattan can't get to Long Island. Right. Why don't we call Long Island and have them keep the guys who can't get to Manhattan and we'll keep the guys who can't get to Long Island? They tried it once and they didn't like it. It made too much sense. It's going to be a long night. Here, take a look at that. You'll get a kick out of it. Hey, Barney, this is marvelous. Deputy Inspector. There's a slim chance of anything like that happening, but... it's kind of a kick to see it in an official publication, huh? Deputy Inspector. I know guys who have been on the force 30, 40 years, have never even been considered for a job like this. Take me, for instance. I'm proud of you. I'm going to put this on the bulletin board. No, no. Don't say anything. Don't tell anybody. It would just be causing a lot of excitement over nothing. I haven't even told Liz. Deputy Inspector Barney Miller. What a thrill. It's a thousand-to-one shot. The 12th won't be the same without you. Come on, I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to miss you. Fish, there are five precinct captains who've got more time in on the force than I do. We're all going to miss you. Cook, Leeds, Stevenson, Rourke, and Burns. And Carmichael. You know what politics and seniority mean in an appointment like this? I've got a feeling you're going to make it. Come on. Don't be ridiculous. Carmichael? Who's Carmichael? Hey, I can't get any more in the safe. That's what I call a classy problem. There must be a $100,000 here in small bills. Oh... Where am I going to put it? How about beach property in San Juan? I can't leave this stuff sitting around here till morning. Oh, man. Do you know what the interest is on $100,000 from now until morning? I'm telling you, we are blowing a very big opportunity. I apologize. That's okay. I apologize to the entire world. On behalf of the entire world, I accept your apology. What else? I want to go to the men's room. Why didn't you say so? I want to suffer, but I don't want to wet my coat. All right, hurry up. You don't want to miss your ambulance. I'm not fit to be around human beings. Come on, come on, come on. Hey, Fish? What would you do if you had all this money? I'd take a trip around the world. I'd send Bernice a few bucks... and postcards. She loves picture postcards. You know, I got an interesting question. Yeah, what's that? Why would a flasher close the door to the bathroom? Jeesh. What the hell was that? I think it was a wolf. It's the rotten plumbing. Mr. Farber, are you through? Farber's in the bathroom? He don't sound like he feels too good. Farber! Farber! Chano, give me a hand. What's going on, Fish? Wojo, help Chano. What'd he do? Tried to electrocute himself. He put one finger in the light socket and one foot in the toilet bowl. No kidding. I didn't know he was that tall. Come on! Barney... I'm sorry. I... I think he's dead. Taking a prisoner to the bathroom is a professional obligation, not a social function. I didn't think he could hurt himself in the toilet. Look up your statistics. Toilets are very high up in the statistics. Give me the coroner's office. That's all right. If I was in a hurry, I wouldn't be calling you. Man, I sure hate for something like this to happen, man. All right, all right, there's nothing you can do about it now. Fill out the coroner's report. Yes, sir. This is Detective Fish, 12th Precinct. Look, we got a customer. Suicide. Electrocution in the men's room. Men's room, right. Light socket and the toilet bowl. Very imaginative, yeah. Okay, junior, get it in here. Hey, it's freezing in here. Ever since we washed the furnace, we can't do a thing with it. Some dump. If I'd have known I was coming here, I'd have resisted arrest. Hold on. I take it all back. Hey, who left the petty cash laying out all over the desk? Sloppy, sloppy. Petty cash? Barney! Barney, I ain't sure, but I think he's alive. What are you talking about? I put a mirror under his nose and I think it fogged a little. Where the hell are those guys from Bellevue? I'll try them again. Hello, coroner? I'm going to put you on hold. What happened? The flasher committed suicide, but very badly. He's alive. He's alive! Hey! Keep him warm. Put anything on him, your coats, anything. He's got a pulse, not much, but it's there. Harris... Come on, pulse! Hey, this is more clothes than this dude has had on in his life. You ready? Yeah. One, two, three, four, five... Uh, I think he's turning blue. Oh, man. Don't turn blue, man! He don't look too blue, does he? Yeah, he looks pretty blue to me. One, two, three, four, five... Barney, you're not blowing hard enough, man. Wait a minute. I lost his pulse. Anything? Not yet. Pop him again. Over here. Over here. All right, step aside. We'll take care of everything. I got a pulse. I got a pulse. Attaboy, Farber. Come on, baby. Charlie, the oxygen. What's all that money on the desk? Payday. Charlie! I didn't know cops make that kind of money. We're very good cops. How's he look? He seems to be fine. His heart stopped. I had to hit him in the chest with my fist. Yeah, I think you saved his life and I know you broke his ribs. It seemed to be the thing to do at the time. It was a good decision. You'd make a good doctor. Of course, you'd make a lot less money. He looks pretty good, doesn't he? Yeah, he didn't look that good to begin with. 12th Precinct, Sergeant Yemana. Hey, Barney, it's the coroner's office. They're still on hold. Tell them to forget it. Forget it. The guy's still alive. Sorry. Hey, did you know this guy has nothing on under his coat? He'll be delighted you noticed. Hey, Engine Room. What's the matter with you guys down there? Turn the heat down. The humidity is murder up here. We can't get the stamps to stick to the envelopes. I wish I could say the same for my shorts. Very well put. Harris, release those guys from the one-four and say thank you. Will do. While you're at it, call downstairs, See if you can turn down the steam. All my papers are curling up. Yeah, yeah. You should have seen what someone wrote downstairs in the snow. Where's Chano? Stopped by at Bellevue to have breakfast with a nurse. Captain Miller, can I see you a moment, please? We found that wife beater at a bar on Third Avenue. He looked worse than she did. She'll never press charges. She won't, but he will. Yes, what can I do for you? There seems to be an error. What kind of error? Easy. There's no error. Mr. Wojciehowicz signed for $216,487. Yeah, somewhere in there. Exactly in there. $216,487? Okay, knock it off. 216,000... All right, you've counted it. What's the problem? There's exactly $5000 missing. $5000? That's impossible. Maybe you ought to count it again. I've counted it three times. That right, Pete? That's correct. I counted it too. It's a bundle short. Fish? Yeah? Count it. Harris? You watch Fish. Pete, you watch Harris. Wojciehowicz, check out the safe again. No, there's nothing in the safe, Barney. Hey, come on, you guys, stop clowning around. Now, this ain't funny. Come on, Fish, Harris... Hey, man... Yemana? Don't look at me. I don't touch that stuff. I'm an addict. Check out the other desks, will you? Wojciehowicz, check out that safe again. Chano's missing. Check out the safe again! Mr. Gross, there was a lot of excitement here last night. The money could have been misplaced or gotten buried under some of this official... litter. Have you ever misplaced $5000 before, captain? Yeah, once, in a Monopoly game. Barney, there's nothing in the safe but petty cash. Oh? $16. And that's for two weeks. $75,000... $80,000... $85,000. What are you up to, Fish? $90,000... $95,000. Count careful, now. $100,000... $105,000... $5000... I'll never pay it off at $714.00 a month. $714,000... $715,000... Hey, Fish. $5000... $10,000... I don't see it anywhere. There's nothing on these desks. Wojo, are you certain when you signed this money out of Siegel's, it was all there? Yeah, sure I'm sure. Then where the hell could it have gone? I don't know. Harris, you were standing right there when I was putting it in the safe. Hey, you wouldn't let me help you, remember? You said it was all yours. You said that? It was a figure of speech, Mr. Gross. Detective Wojciehowicz probably felt personally responsible for the money. He is personally responsible for the money. You hear that, Harris? Hey, man, don't look at me. If I needed any extra money, I could do windows. Hey, hey, hey, fellows. Look what I got from Miss Sanchez. Man, you're in the wrong business. Where the hell did she get that? She got it from Mr. Farber's coat. Yeah, seems like when you guys took him out of here, he had just enough strength to steal it. Well, there's hope for him yet. At least he's given up suicide. Yeah, but he's taken up stealing. One step at a time. Mr. Gross? Count it, please. Thank you, captain. I knew I didn't lose it. $1200... I never took my eyes off it... Except for a minute. I must have aged a couple hundred years. A couple hundred thousand... $200, $400... 12th Precinct. Sergeant Yemana. Yeah, he's right here. Barney, it's for you. It's the commissioner. I'll take it in my office. Congratulations, Barney. Congratulations for what? Barney is up for deputy inspector. No kidding! How about that? It's all here. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Sign this. My pleasure. Hey, is he taking that money out of here? Yeah, and it's about time. Hey, you... What? Stick 'em up. Don't be ridiculous. You're in jail. You don't even have a gun. I don't care. Stick 'em up! Take it easy, kid. What a night. All right, you guys got your final reports ready? Yeah, here's mine. Anybody else? Almost finished. Well? Well, what? The commissioner. What did he say? Oh, Carmichael got it. Carmichael? Oh, I knew I wasn't going to get it. Carmichael's got four years on me. He's a good man, Carmichael. I'm sorry, Barney. Don't be silly. Here you go, Barn. Barney... Will you guys cut it out? Come on, now. I knew I wasn't going to get it. I didn't expect it. Come on. There's always next year. Wojciehowicz, get that fixed, will you? 145th Street and 9th, that's where they're going to have the heist. Hey, Barney. Somebody left this package for you at the desk downstairs. Hey, I'll bet it's from Siegel's. They gave me a credit application. Nice of them, if it was. It's probably for all you guys. No, it's addressed to you. "To Captain Barney Miller, "with grateful appreciation "of all your efforts on my behalf. Lyle W. Farber, Attorney at Law."
