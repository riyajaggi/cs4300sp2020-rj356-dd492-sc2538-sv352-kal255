 Twenty... Sit down, Nathan. Seventy-two. Where'd you move the policy room, huh? Who knows from policies? I'm not in the insurance business. One rotten Nathan Levine gives the rest of us a bad name. Well, if you're not runnin' numbers, what's these betting slips? Betting slips? Yeah, these betting slips. Angelo P., 611, dash-dash, 50 cents. Oh, oh, oh. That's a friend of mine. Angelo Palermo.

 What's the 50 cents for? That's what I'm gonna give him. Hey, how are ya, Fish? Good morning. I feel fine, unless it's some sort of a disease to forget someone's name once in a while. Oh, it happens all the time. It came right back to me: "Bernice." But she wants to make a big deal out of it. You forgot Bernice's name? Only for a second. I knew who she was, I just couldn't think of what to call her. Now she says, uh, I'm losing the rest of my faculties. Hey, Harris, how many of those checks you got? Thirteen, totaling $374.30. Why would a guy pass out that much paper for so little cash? Well, he's crooked, but he's not greedy. Uh, does this look like the same dude to you? I don't know. Checks are not my specialty. Bills are more in my line. Ah. Peculiarities? I haven't got any. Everybody's got peculiarities. I'm sorry, I haven't got any. Come on, Nathan, let's have 'em. Now, now, what's going on? He's being uncooperative, captain. I mean, he won't answer any of the questions right. Why don't you make it easy on yourself, Mr. Levine, cooperate with Detective Wojciehowicz. Answer the questions. Peculiarities? I sleep in the nude. Sleeps in the nude. Is that what you wanted to know? I'm just tryin' to do my job. Well, tell the doctor I apologize. I-I just forgot. Yeah. Today, 2:00. Okay, thanks. I don't remember making that appointment. Maybe I am going out of my mind. Yeah, when you're getting older, that's the first thing that goes. Not according to Bernice. Good morning. Good Morning. Hi, Liz. Hi. Hi. Hi, Woj. Hi, Mike, you're looking very well. Yeah, I'm using a new soap. Do you like it better than the old one? Well, the old one got about the size of a dime. And it got about that thin. And it got very difficult when you get the two pieces together, you couldn't get any lather. Nice to see you, Mike. Bingo. We got a make on that paper hanger. It's Harold Polansky, and I got three possible addresses. Let's go. I'll tell ya, I don't know how they get away with it. Oh, man, most people are very poor judges of character. Yeah? Well, it really burns me up. Anytime I wanna cash a check, nobody wants to take it. Hey, man, I mean, look at you. What? Well, I mean, you wear dishonest clothes. I never have no trouble. You know, you're right. Most people are very poor judges of character. Raincoat and British Walkers. You really mean business today, huh? Yes, I'm on a new case. Social Services called this morning. Now, in case I don't get home in time, this is David's piano teacher. Okay. Where are they sending you today? South Bronx. South Bronx? That's a rough area. The Rockefellers in East Hampton don't need me. Have you checked? No. Snap judgment. What kind of case you got? Oh, it's, um, a mother whose son just got out of prison. Ex-convict. Oh, Barney. And he can't get a job and she has two other sons, both involved in street gangs and both dropouts and the husband drinks. Couldn't they give you something easy once in a while, like an unwed mother? They save the biggies for the best. Oh, I know. The South Bronx. That's no picnic there. Gang wars, arson. Well, I admit, I'm a little nervous, but it's a challenge. I mean, I know it's dangerous, but it's stimulating all at the same time. My blood pressure hasn't been this high in years. Thanks. Oh, I mean, in the daytime. You know, you kiss good for a social worker. Oh. Tanks, tanks. My field supervisor will be very pleased. She asked me if I had good relations with the police. What did you tell her? I said, uh, whenever I could. Listen, uh, give me a call when you get up there. Oh, Barney, it's not necessary. I'll be perfectly all right. All right. Okay, okay. Goodbye. Give me a call anyway. Oh, Barney. Take care, Mrs. Miller. I will, Woj, thanks. Bye, Mike. Oh, no, look at this. See? You save all the little pieces and after about a year, you melt 'em together and you get a whole new bar of soap. Oh, nice to see you again, Mike. Bye. Oh, thank you, Fish. How's Bernice? Fine, fine, thank you, Elizabeth. Oh, give her my love. Oh, and tell her I'm sorry I forgot her birthday yesterday. Oh. Okay, just, uh, sit here at the desk again. Oh, hey, inspector. How you makin' out, Wojo? All right. Hey, well, well. If it isn't Nathan "The Bagman." Hello, inspector. Hey, Nate, what'd they nail you for this time, same old thing? Policy. Oh, yeah, huh. Well, a leopard'll never change his stripes. Hello, Day Old Bakery? What do ya got layin' around that says, "Happy Birthday, Bernice"? What we got here? "Previous convictions: seven." That's all, Nate? Well, a man can't be unlucky all the time. "Peculiarities: sleeps in the nude." What's with "sleeps in the nude"? Well, that's his statement. Oh, come on, that ain't peculiarities. Peculiarities is if a man goes around collecting women's shoes, something that line. You don't do nothin' like that, do you, Nate? Nah. Nah, course not. He may be a bagman, but he ain't a weird bagman. World Series, 1936. Look at this. Ha! Carl Hubbell, Lou Gehrig, Mel Ott. Nineteen-thirty... I was at that World Series. No kiddin'. That was before I was born. No kiddin'. "Happy birthday, Bernie"? You ought to be able to shove in a "C" in there somewhere. Hey, inspector. How are ya? Hello, Barney. I just stopped by to see you. Come on inside. Thank ya. Oh, uh, excuse me, inspector? Mm? Uh, you got my baseball. Oh. Ha, ha. Which hand? Old hidden ball trick, huh? Hey, you wanna sell it, Wojo? Nope. I'll give ya $20 for it. No, thanks. Ehh. I thought Polish people like to bowl. Barney, that Wojciehowicz, is he a good cop? Wojo? Yeah. Well, he don't know much about human nature. Mike, uh, hold my calls for a few minutes, will ya? If Liz calls, put her right through though. Right. Barney, I gotta talk to you. Sure, what can I do for you? I been offered this job with the parole board, Barney, and I've kinda been debatin' in my mind as to whether I should take it or not. Parole board? You should be flattered by the offer. I am, I am, Barney. All them important cases to discuss, you know, and evaluating the pros and the cons. Pardon the pun. And all them people in jail filin' their petitions to get out again. You know, join us in this society. Well, then, I guess I gotta take it, Barney. I mean, somebody's gotta keep them vermin behind bars, right? What do you think, Barney? I think we need you more right here, inspector. Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. The more you think about it... Maybe. Hello. Oh, thanks, Mike. Hello, Liz? Okay, you got there okay? I just wanted to... I can't hear you, what's goi...? I can't hear you. Who's arguing in the back there? The brothers having an argument. Wonderful. All right, listen, as long as you're uh... Did...? What was...? Something break, Liz? Liz, are you okay? What? What's going on there? Was that glass smashing, Liz? Liz, are you okay? Look, Li... Liz? Liz? Phone went dead. Yeah, I guess maybe you're right, Barney. Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. Barney, there's... There's no way they can trace the call. Mm-hm. I was afraid not. Look, call the 5-1 in the Bronx. Uh, tell them I wanna talk to the watch commander. Department of Social Services says she was sent up here. Oh, thanks, Mike. Barney, I got the 5-1 on line two, Barney. Uh, tell them I'll take it in my office. Thanks for the nice powwow, Barney. Right. I'll give ya $25. Oh, n-no thanks. Why not, Wojo? Well, I'm, uh, just used to having it on my desk, inspector. Huh? Come on, what's it to you? "Red Ruffing, Lefty Gomez, Twinkletoes Selkirk". All right, 30 bucks, my final offer. I just don't wanna sell it, inspector. Okay, Wojciehowicz, if that's the way you want it. You know, sometimes a man could use a friend among the higher-ups in this little New York City department of ours. Nyeh. See you around, men. All right, inside. Stand over here, Mr. Polansky. Big deal over a lousy little baseball, for cryin' out loud. Take a seat over there, please. Oh, what's the difference? Standing, sitting, I don't care anymore! Man, this dude's got checks from banks in 32 states, including Hawaii. Oh, yeah? Yeah, and look at this. The blank checks match the checks he's cashed. Well, looks like we got you, Mr. Polansky. What is that, something new? It's the story of my life. Yeah, they sit up there, laughing at me. The break givers. The gods of men. Nothing for you today, Polansky! We got a load of "no luck" for you again. Yeah, you sure? No 10-52 at that address? Well, my... My wife went up there on a case, Frank, and I got a call from her and... Look, uh, would you do me a favor and send a car around? I know you don't like to go in there. I-I'd consider it a personal favor, Frank. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah, I think we got him up here. Are you Nathan Levine? I'm one of them. Yeah, we got him up here. They got his bail ticket. Yeah, okay. I gotta go see a doctor. I got a 2:00 appointment. It's only quarter to 1. I also gotta pick up a cake. I hope it ain't serious. It will be if they don't find a "C". No, I mean, uh, I hope, uh, whatever you got ain't serious. Of course it's serious. Everything that happens to you immediately following the age of puberty is serious. Really? You'll find out when you get there. For cryin' out loud. I mean, it's baseball. What's the big deal? Hey, man, why didn't you just give it to him? I use it as a paperweight. Hey, Wojo, man, you could use a rock. Next thing, he'd come along and want my rock. There's no end to blackmail. Okay, Mr. Polansky, have a seat over there at my desk. Sign these papers, huh? Hey, Harris, fingerprints check out. Beautiful. Yeah. Yeah, we had to take some new pictures. You gained some weight since the last ones. It's guilt. It makes you eat like a pig. I used to be taller too. Hey, man, I called over to, uh, Manhattan South. They said they'll pick him up later. Okay, hurry it up, will ya, Mr. Polansky? Easy, I'm not used to signing my own name. Hey, ain't that something? These checks are really great, man. He's an artist, I'm telling you. Ah, it's a curse. I wanted to go into politics. I am a student of American history. You know, when I was a kid, I used to dream about signing the Declaration of Independence. Oh, yeah? Now I can. You wanna tell Captain Miller we got his wife here? Never mind. Thank you. I'll tell him myself. Hello. Hello. How are you? Hey, Liz. You all right? Well, I am a little embarrassed. Over what? Five policemen walked into that room and removed me as if I were a Brownie in a forest fire. I'm s... I'm sorry. I thought you were in trouble. All that shouting on the phone, that furniture breaking... There was a family discussion and somebody was making a point. What about the glass breaking? There are two sides to every discussion. Who pulled the phone out of the wall? Everyone. It was the only thing they all agreed on. What were they fighting about? Oh, the older son, the ex-convict, can't get a job and he was taking it out on the family and the furniture. Well, I'm sorry. My first day on a new case and I'm preempted. Yeah? Barney, excuse me. Here's the sheet on Polansky. No question about it. He's been passing all the bad paper around. Three arrests, two convictions. He's a very talented fellow. Look at the signatures he made for me. Hey, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Hancock, they look perfect. They are perfect. Why does he keep getting into trouble? Well, you see, he goes on parole, he can't get a job, writes a bad check, goes back in again. Gets on parole again, can't keep a job... Thank you, Chano. Yeah. You know, a man like, I mean, this could be an artist. Of course, I haven't heard of anyone starting writing the signature first and then doing the painting, but... It's not just ex-convicts. Everybody's having a tough time getting a job today. That's true. What does your ex-con do? He's a lathe operator. Got his training in the machine shop at Sing Sing. Does he have any real experience? Are you kidding? He was doing 10 to life. Ooh. Those are real credentials. All right, I'll see you at home about 6, huh? Um... 7. Seven? Seven. I have another call to make. Where is it this time, the Middle East? You really wanna know? No. I'm gonna try and do it cold turkey. Hey, Barney, look. Winston Churchill, Pablo Picasso, Eddie Fisher. Eddie Fisher? They're remarkable forgeries. Oh, he calls them biographs. Good. Very good. Yeah, maybe so. But he can't do Julian Bond yet. Fish, what did the doctor say? He said I was at... That the time of my life when my body is going through changes. Sou... Sounds like menopause. It is menopause. I caught it from Bernice. It's not... It's not giving ya... It's not giving ya all that much trouble, is it? Well, just a little difficulty in remembering things. What's the serial number of your gun? 186 693 478 A. See? You got priorities. You're... You're more selective about your memory. You remember things that are important to you. You think so? Sure. What's your anniversary? Sometime in February. The 12th. The 12th, right. 186 693 478 A. Pretty good. Mr. Polansky. Yeah. Social Services never been able to help get you a job, has it? Nobody's ever done anything for me. Well, if you're ever lucky enough to get paroled again, give me a call. Do I need a cop? Cops do not help ex-cons. Maybe, but you're in luck. I happen to have a wife who's a social worker. I happen to have a brother. He owns a machine shop in Huntington, Long Island. Polansky's Foundry and Iron Works. He's making money hand over fist. You think he'd help me? Forget it! He would help anybody in the world except me. Right? Right. Huntington, Long Island. Right. Thanks. You're welcome. Who wants Clark Gable? Hi. Hello. Hi, Barney. Hello, inspector. Barney, I took your good advice to heart. You'll be happy to know that I decided to stay here, right where I am. You and all your men on the old firing line. We would have missed you, inspector. Ah, I would have missed you too. Most of ya. Excuse me a minute, uh... Yeah. Sure. Got a phone call to make. Go ahead, Barney. Well, men, see you around. See you, inspector. Oh. Inspector Lugar. Yes, what is it, Detective Wojciehowicz? I've, uh, decided to change my mind about the ball. What ball? Oh, that? Ah. Ah, forget it, son. I-I put it completely out of my head. I'm not interested in buying a ball. I'm not talkin' about sellin' it to ya. I'm talking about givin' it to you. Don't sweet talk me with that soft soap, Wojo, bec... You what? Givin' it to you. You mean, you're gonna... Well, that's, uh... That's darn decent of you, Wojie. I-I hardly know what... Oh, hey. Huh? Inspector, uh... it means a lot more to you than it does to me. That's true. That... You old softy, you. "Carl Hubbell, Lou Gehrig, John Hancock." Was, uh...? Was he...? Was he with the Giants? No, uh, he was one of the original Yankees. Oh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, utility infielder, right? â™ª And it's one, two, three Strikes, you're out â™ª â™ª At the old ball game â™ª Look at this, a little present from our forger friend. The Declaration of Independence. Is the ink dry yet? Barely. Heh-heh. Hey, is his John Hancock as good as the one he did for me? He didn't use John Hancock. He used Harold Polansky. Well, that makes it a genuine forgery. Listen, that's okay by me. As long as he's writing his own name, he's not writing somebody else's. Yeah.
