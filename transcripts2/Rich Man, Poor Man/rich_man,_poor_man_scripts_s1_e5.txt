 Last on RICH MAN, POOR MAN: I want the whole world to know what a rich man I married! So rich that he gives his money away to a millionaire! Suppose I say no to the whole proposition. I still think the shopping center out by the lake is certain to succeed. It wouldn't necessarily have to be on your acreage. We've been trying to keep it together for Billy but... Are you talking about a divorce? Dear Tommy: I've taken the baby and left you. This is for the best. Teresa. You're not gonna blow this shot, are you? I don't care, Smitty. I just don't care. All I know is I just gotta find my kid!

 You're real that we're suppose to open within a month and still two thirds aren't ended? Everywhere I look, empty stores. Oh, God, Julie. If we could only start over again. Look, if you go back to him you're making the mistake of your life. I better be getting back to the hospital. We're gonna be 100% occupancy, buddy. End of the week. On the way of fame and fortune, son. All right, all right, all right. Yes? - Rudy, I didn't wake you, did I? Yes, you did. Who is this? - It's Bill Denton. Listen. I hate to bother you. But can I see you sometime tomorrow? All right. Why don't you come by the office anytime tomorrow. I think... we better make it some place else. Lunch, maybe. But I only take 45 minutes. - That'll be okay.

 We'll make it some place near you. How about "Ripley's"? Fine. One o'clock suits you? - I'll be waiting. Bill? What's the trouble with you? - I'll tell you when I see you, but... Believe me, I wouldn't bother you unless it was absolutely critical. Okay, I'll see you then, huh? - Rudy... I can't tell you how much I app-- What in the world was that? - Hi, Ma, sorry. It was Bill Denton. Denton? - My old Economic professor from Whitby. You mean that Bolshevik? He's no more of a Bolshevik than I am. - He has his nerve calling up at this time of night. Listen, if it wasn't for Bill Denton I'd probably still be working for $75 a week. Don't be ridiculous. When I first heard that phone ringing, I thought it was your father. My father? - He just liked it to call at this hour. Where'd this frosted cream pie came from? Maybe it's fattener. I'm just getting too fat, anyway. Ma, Pa is dead, drowned almost 12 years ago. That's what he wants everybody to think. He's not dead. He's avoiding his legal responsibilities. Ma... - He's sitting some place right this minute with a drink in his hand, a blonde on his lap, laughing up his sleeve. - Neatest trick of the week. Got the morals of a mutt. Him and that brother of yours are both... cut from the same old cloth. - I think I'll try to get back to sleep. Two of a kind. And their little disappearing act. - Tom didn't disappear. Where is he then? - He's out on the coast some place, last I heard. Hey, Smitty! Hey, Smitty. Oh, no! - How are you? I guess I need you like a hole in the head. Come on, Smitty. You talk like that. You're gonna get me the idea you're not happy to see me. Why would I be happy to see you? What'd you ever do to me? Except to kill me. You handed me my head. Alsie. This is Tommy Jordache a real authentic idiot. I got him a title shot with Magadino and he runs away. For some bimbo clear accross the country. Cost me a fortune. Don't let me spoil the reunion, Smitty. - Reunion? Happy heartburn. You want a candy bar or something? - No, I don't want no candy. Hey, Smitty. You still handling Quales? How I got two doozies like you and Joey Quales? I'll never know. I must have sinned in another life or something. Why a sinner, man? - No, just murder without a gun, that's all. You all right, Tommy? - Yeah, I'm fine. I've been in the north. I heard about that pasting you took up at Portland. - Yeah, it was a... "look bad jack" night. - Tommy, why? - I needed money. How are you fixed now? - No, no... Smitty, I need a job. What kind of job? - Anything. Sparring partner? You name it. Got your gear? - Yeah. I gotta be crazy. Come on. Hey, Smitty. Where is that sexy old man of mine? In the dressing room. - Oh, yeah? Tommy? He's Tommy Jordache. Linda Quales, the champ's wife. - Hi. How are you? - Fine. How are you? Kind of afraid of the look. Well, you look fine. - Hey, you look fine too. Hey, would you tell him I'm here, please? - Sure. Come on - Thank you. Gin! You knucklehead. - You are so lucky. Lucky nothing. He sees me picking up tens. He gives me a ten! Joey... Joey... Joe! This is Tom Jordache. I've talked to you about him. Yeah, yeah. What've I got? - Under 35. You're the guy who blew the Magadino fight, right? You remember Paddy. This is Fresco Murphy. The best cutman in the business. Oh yeah, I saw you fight Billy Terranova in Jersey, right? Yeah, good fighter. - A bum. Joey... Joey, I'd like you to work with Tom today. You know, I'm hoping to figure out some way to keeping him up permanent. We'll see, we'll see. What do you got? Linda got here? - Yeah, she just got here. - Fine. Okay, okay. Let's see what he's got of anything, huh? You're gonna pick that up? - No, you can have it. Listen I hope he's better than cream puffs you've been lining up for me lately, okay? It's just his way. You know, Tom? - Yeah. Just sparring, don't throw anything. - All right. So you fought Terranova, huh? So did I, twice. He couldn't hit me and the punk bled hell from the eyes. Neither can you. I'm over here. Sorry, buy yourself a safe fight for you. Strictly verboten. Hello? - Matusik? It's Tom Jordache. Oh, yeah. Where are you? - Hey, I got your letter. - My letter? Hey wait, you know who this is. This is Tom Jordache. You're supposed to be looking for my wife and kid. I know, I got it right here in front of me. Look, Tom, listen. You know, I got your bus fare overdue. I had expenses too, you know. Yeah, you'll get your money. I'll get your money. You just find my wife and kid. Okay, but you get me that money out in the mail, will you? We'll be able to move on this. Yeah, you'll get your money. Hi. How are you doing? Hey! How are you? You're gonna be the guest? - Yeah. It looks like that. Oh, that's great. Good to have you aboard, as we use to say in the Navy. - Aye, Aye. Is Smitty around? - No, as a matter of fact, they're not. They all went in to town. They had a meeting. Something about a fight in Vegas. Yeah. He said something about giving me a motel room. Oh, well they won't be back till late. I tell you what. What don't you put your stuff in our room? Okay. How about a swim? You bring a bathing suit? - No, no suit. Come on in. We'll find you a suit. I'm sure we can find a suit of Joey's that you can get yourself into. I can try. Here we go. There. Get yourself into that. You travel with Joey all the time? - Oh, all the time. We don't sleep together when he's training. But he likes to keep me around. He says it keeps him on edge. I can see that. Well, I'll see you outside. If there's anything you want, just let me know. Hey. There is something. I thought you'd never ask. Miss Calderwood. - Hello, McKinley. Right. Well, then make the flag bigger. Make the flag bigger. Yeah, we can do that. Hello, Brad, Rudy. Am I interrupting anything? Well, not to give you a short answer, but yes. Oh, good. I've been lying and waiting for you for days. Or was I laying? Well, I'm gonna leave you alone, for you folks can talk like that. Is that it? Oh, no. But I'm not ranked to you. She's prettier than I am. She's the boss's daughter. So, I'll just get back to you later. Trouble can always wait. What trouble? - All those ice cream franchises aren't moving at all. Why not? Bottom line is: Say we're giving too much quality. But I'll get you a... concrete set of proposals on your desk in the morning. They say we can make twice as big a cone for half the price if we aerate and take out some of the butter fat and add more emulsifiers like that, you know. I'm leaving that put. Yeah, it's like my daddy always said, you gotta choose your size and the world will live with it. Oxes or the foxes. Don't ya' do anything I wouldn't? Want a Coke or something? - How about a drink instead? A drink? - You seem to be forgetting that I'm not 15 years old anymore. A drink it is. Let's see. You like vodka and orange juice, right? Well, what do you know? He remebered. How's your mother?  Why don't you come out sometime and see for yourself? You've only been out twice since we got back. Well, I've been pretty busy. Things just keep coming up. Yes, I know. That's why I've taken matters under my own hands. I have here two theater tickets 3rd row center for "West Side Story". For which I did practically everything but batter my pink and white body to get. So how about it, sport? You're inviting me to the theater? - After which you can take me to supper. I can, huh? - That so, you won't feel so inmasculated. That's thoughful of you. Yes? It's Mr. Heath from New York. - Oh, put him on, please. Mrs. P, no more calls after that. I'm late for lunch as it is. Rudy, how are you? - I'm sitting here plying Virginia Calderwood with booze. Oh, part of growing up. - Eddie sends his best regard. What's on your mind? - The Transco merging. I'm getting very nervous. And if we don't move, we'll gonna blow it. And what's the log jam? - Duncan Calderwood as usual. Oh. good. We're about rapping old dad? May I help? Eddie, hang on.  You can help by getting your little rusty-dusty out of here. I'll pick you up around five o'clock tomorrow. Stubborn fellow. You know, if I can ever be of any help with the great man, all you have to do is ask. You'd be very surprised. - No, thanks. Everything it's fine. I'll see you tomorrow. Eddie? Yeah, look... I think I've got the old man listening. What I want from you is a concise 10 pages, words of one syllable on the Transco operation. Okay. Hey, listen. I'm having some friends in tomorrow evening. If you're coming down this way, why don't you stop by and have a drink. I'll try. - Well, try hard. An old friend of yours will be there. Who? - Let's just save it for a surprise. I don't like surprises. - You'll like this one. I'm going to lunch. Rudy! Rudy, over here. It's good to see you. Thank you for coming. Sit down. Sit down. I'm just having a little belt. Would you join me? - No, thanks. I'm sorry I'm late. Success hasn't gone to your butt, anyway. - I work out every morning up at the college. Oh, wait. University now. - Oh, yeah, we're going big time. How are you, Bill? - Okay. And Judy? - She's... She's not that better. Losing weight. She's got insomnia. What did the doctors say? - They tell her to try to get some sleep. What she really needs is a change. A trip, maybe. Listen, if it's dough, you got it. - It's not money. That's not why I came to see you about, Rudy. What is it, then? My job at Whitby owned for 10 year. I mean, this investigation. If I should come through that, my job would be permanent but... Hi. The special today is Salisbury Steak and that comes with two vegetables. Just coffee. - Another Bourbon for me, please. - Okay. What about this investigation? They're gonna dump me, Rudy. It seems they've been keeping a dossier all these years. On you? - Good old me. Consisting of what? - The usual. A "Ban the Bomb" meeting. An anti "House Un-American Activities Committee" petitioner, too. An ironic reference to the free enterprise system. What else? That thing at Sing Sing. The Rosenberg protest. You were there, weren't you ? No. I missed it. I would've gone down with you but I got hung up at the last minute. I wish to heaven I'd gotten hung up. But no, there I was. Page 1 of the Times. Charlie photogenic getting clubbed by the cops. Who is after you? Thank you. - Thank you. Who's after you? - The whole meeting and their full grad. It's just the usual academic hatchet job. Look, just because Joe McCarthy is gone doesn't mean-- What's the matter? - It's the guy over there by the jukebox. Keeps looking over here. Bill, he's from the store. He works in the shipping room. Just a little incipient paranoia. Not worse than a bad cold. I'm afraid to quote Marx. For God's sake. How am I supposed to teach the thrust of 19th century Economics without Karl Marx? All right, all right, look. How can I help you, Bill? The board of audition is holding a special committee just assigned to my case. Now, I'm to be allowed to present witnesses on my own behalf. As my only square friend. Your word would have a great deal of weight. What would you want me to say? - That I'm not a communist. It's that the truth? - I don't even belong to the auto club. Well, then what's the problem? - What do you mean? Why don't you just say you're not communist. I can't. - Why not? Look Rudy, if you don't know, I can't tell you. Well, try, help me. Because I'm really trying to understand. Because they have no right to ask me that question! There is a principle involved here: Academic freedom... - All right, all right! But you're willing to have me answer for you. Where's the principle in that? The principle in that is called friendship! - Oh, Bill, don't you-- Look, you can say what I can't say. - You mean "won't say". All right, "won't say"! Hey, forget it. I hear you. And you're right. I'm taking a principle stand, but I want you to bail me out. All right, it's not just that, Bill. Look, I'd help you if I could. But you've gotta understand I've got some problems too. Duncan Calderwood is on  that board of trustees. And you know his politics. Rudy, are you afraid of losing your job? I'm trying to get him to okay along on this Transco deal. I'm talking about $10 million. Collateralized by his DC shares and he's sit in their wavering. I gotta be honest with you Bill. If I testify for you, if I take a political stands that he doesn't like-- He'll blow you out of the water. - Yes. Well, I'll say one thing, Rudy. Beneath that somewhat ingenuous exterior, there is a very shrewd character. You'll go far, Rudy. I only hope you like what you find when you get there. Bill... - Goodbye, Rudy. Bill, wait... Good evening. - Rudy, Virginia! I'm sorry we're so late. We couldn't get a cab. And I asked this gentleman a drink at "Sorory's". Or was that two? It was five. Let's see now. Do you know everybody? Julie. How are you? It's good to see you, Rudy. Julie, this is Virginia Calderwood. Julie Abbott. - How do you do? I know Mrs. Abbott. She was up at Lake Whitby taking pictures the day we opened the first shopping center. For "Life" magazine, wasn't it? - You have a good memory, Miss Calderwood. I like to keep up on things. Aren't you some old child good friend of Rudy's or something like that? Julie and I went to High School together. - Port Phillip High School, right? - Yes. You really do like to keep up on things, Miss Calderwood. All Rudy's friends interest me. - Virginia! There's somebody here who is dying to meet you. Excuse me. You're looking marvelous. Where did you get that tan? Nevada mainly, and Arizona. I've been doing a book on the Navajos. - A book? And you? What have you been up to? Still with the shopping center? We've got four of those now. - Branching up. - In all directions. We got a hotel in California, an ice cream business. Looks like we're getting into electronics. Sounds like quite a tycoon. That's right. Tycoon, financial whiz and all those things. So, what else is happening in your life? Not a lot. The tycoon business seize into a man's spare time. No wife? Nothing like that? I don't even have a dog. Where's Willie? - New Orleans. Doing what? - Knowing Willie, he's probably in a bar room, some place warming his way into the hearts of strangers. I seem to be missing something here. Willie and I got a divorce. Or I did, anyway. It was uncontested. When was all this? - Last winter. Curious. What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why didn't you call me? I thought about it... ... for a long time, but-- Excuse me. Kevin! This isn't your coat, it's gonna have to do. - That's it. This is Kevin MacInness. We did the Navajo book together. I'd like you to meet and old friend of mine. - Some other time. I've gotta get out of this place. This people are not for real. We're just about to leave when you came. Okay, okay. Come on, come on. - The hell with that. What'd you say? - I said keep your pants on, Charlie. Julie and I are having a conversation. Come on. You don't have to get hostile about it. That was rather rude. - It's allowed to be going around. Who is that guy? His name is Kevin MacInness. - I know his name. I wanna know what he means to you. I'm not serious with him or anybody else and I don't wanna be. Do you understand? Perfectly. I will call you tomorrow. Listen, Rudy... - No, you listen. You and I are gonna be married one of these days. There is no question about it. It's ordained, it's inevitable. And the sooner you get that through your head, the sooner we can settle down, do the business and have a fantastic life together. Now. You go out there... and you give your scruffy friend his walking papers. And I will call you in the morning. Taxi! Come on, before he suddenly decides he's off duty. Where are we going? - The Barbizon. - The Barbizon? Isn't that where you're staying? - Listen, I got a better idea. Why don't we go to your place? It's a little late, Virginia. And I'm tired. I know 37 ways to give artificial respiration. - That sounds fascinating.  Yeah, for consenting adult. Some other time. - Oh, Rudy, don't be a pain. Get in the cab. Come on. Where to? - Delmonico's Hotel. The Barbizon. - No, make that Delmonico's. It's at Park and 49th. What's is gonna be? - The Barbizon. - Oh, come on, Rudy. Virginia... - Please... All I want is a drink, Rudy. - You've had enough, Virginia. You got a laid date, haven't you? With your school girlfriend. Did just have fun? In the garage. Did you use to play doctor? You wanna play doctor, Rudy? - Virginia, give it a rest. You got a laid date with that cheap friend, don't you? - Will you shut up? Stop it. You used me to get through to my father! You dirty-- - Stop that! What's going on back there? - Just drive your cab! Look, Virginia... - Get away from me. Can you make it? Rudy. I just want you to make love to me. - Oh, for God's sake... What's the matter, Rudy? Am I annoying you or something? Is not like it used to be in the old days when you first started working for daddy. Is it? I thought I'd never stop dreaming then. You were over the house all the time. I liked you then, Virginia. I still like you. You liked showing to my father what a young ego go-getter you were. You're just another phony in a Brooks Brothers suit... ...shoving his way to the top. Look, Virginia, I-- - Good night. I'll get you, you bastard! Good morning, Mr. Martin. How's he coming? - See for yourself. The champ's in tip-top shape. How's the box office? - Sold out. You're kidding. About money I don't kid. Time! Hi there, Mr. Martin. - Hey, you looked great up there, champ. It's no wonder with bummy Tommy in the ring with. You go on, Mr. Martin. One more time. You really go there, huh? - Hey, that's enough. Today I had my workout for the year. Take it easy, champ. Three more minutes. Crowd him a little bit this time. You really want me go after that guy? - Well, don't hurt him. What if I flatten him? - Don't even think about it! Enjoying yourself in Las Vegas, Mrs. Quales? - Marvelous. Time! Can't you get somebody that's gonna give me a good workout? I haven't even worked out a good sweat yet! I hope you get your brains knocked out next Friday, showboat. You ought to pay me for box lessons, you bum! You're leaning on pretty hard, Joey. - He's a puck and beaner. What'd he ever do to you? - I don't like the way he fights. I don't like the way he acts. And you can tell him this for me... On second thought, forget it. I'll tell him myself when the time is ripe. Hi, baby. Cool it, cool it. - Hi, honey. How're you feeling? Well, I'm feeling mighty lonesome over there in that big hotel suite by myself. I'll see you Friday night, after the fight. - Okay. Might not even wait to take a shower. - That's a date. All right, Marnie, feel his muscle here. Lisa, give me a big "ooh". That's it. Good. Ready? Here we go. One, two, three... Can we have one, relaxing by the pool, please? - Come on. Come on, huh? Sorry, Joey's got his rope work to do. - Oh no, Smitty, no. I think Mr. Martin would like another one relaxing by the pool. Hey, you said the magic word.  Come on, girls, we're taking another picture relaxing by the pool. All right. Champ, Joey... here, please. Please, you lie down here. That's it. You just get on it. You come over here, honey. You stand up. Give the ooh-oohs there. You kneel. That's so much better, yeah. And you over here. Yes, sit down there. Now everybody looking at the champ. A nice big smile. Here we go. Ready... Hold it... Very good. Thanks, girls. Thanks, champ. Yeah, yeah. Great, great. Go ahead. - "Adios." Thank God for rope work. Get naked. Mr. Jordache? Yeah? - You got a long distance from New York. From who? - I don't know. It was person to person. Want me to see if I get him back? Yeah. - Okay. Yeah? - I have your New York Call.  Would you accept charges for Jerry Matusik? Yeah, go ahead. Put him on. Hey Tom, that you? - Yeah. Hey, did you get my money? - Yeah, and I think I've got some good news. Good news. I can use some good news. Well, a guy I know in the 23rd precinct, says he reminisced a Teresa Santoro. And she fits the description of your wife. Okay. So what about her? - Was about 6 months ago, he says. It was a D&D;, resisting arrest. Now, something like that. And it'll take us digging into the records, you know. And that's the problem. What's the problem? - Well, I gotta buy my hat, kid. How much, Matusik? - Lasino would be fine. That's a pretty nice hat. - Look, I'm imposing on a man's good nature.  All right, I'll wire it to you in the morning. - This time I think we're really on to something. - Yeah. Matusik, now you let me know what happens. Don't worry about a thing, kid. Everything is under control. -Yeah. Joey! Joey! No, no... Joey! No... Joey! No... Yeah? - He knows about us. How do you know he knows? - He broke my nose! He almost kill me. - Wait a minute, Linda. What'd he say? - You are next, that's what he said. What'd you tell him? I told him no!  What do you think I told him? But he didn't believe me. He knows where you are. He's on his way over there now. God only knows what he'll do to you. And later on, to me too, so. I'm going down to the airport right now. Now, wait a minute, Linda. - Tom, you don't know him. He's a murderer. Linda, listen-- - No, you listen! You get out of town! Go.  Hey, Joey. - On your feet, you gutless punk. What's the trouble? - You want it sitting down or standing up? Either way is okay with me. I don't get it. - You and my wife. Oh, you mean just because I've been shacking up with her? Why? I didn't think you'd mind. Fight Joey! Let's see your style now, huh? Let's see how good you are in a locked room, Joey baby! Throw it! I'm gonna wanna blow you up, Joe! What's the matter? No talking now, huh, Joey? Maybe I ought to charge you for lessons, huh Joey? Tommy? Tommy, you in there? Tommy! I don't believe it. I'm looking at it but I can't believe you did this. Oh, great! There goes the fight. What'd I do? Bust it? - Bust it? No, you didn't bust it. You smashed it all to hell. What's the matter with you? - Hey, Smitty, I've taken so much crap! Have you any idea what you cost this people? What are they gonna do? Sue me? You don't get it. You just don't get it. You don't know the kind of trouble you're in! What do you mean? - I mean Frank Martin. He's connected. You didn't know that? I'm talking about the syndicate. And Martin is? - What do you think? They own Joey. They own the joint down there on our strip. This little stun of yours is gonna cost him a million bucks. And kid is "finito". I mean it! It's goodbye Charlie if they get their damned hands on you. All right, I better get the hell out of here. - You better get out of here right now. If I was you, I'd go right now and I'd go to the ocean. And when I got to the ocean, I'd cross that ocean and I wouldn't go back to this country for 10 years. - What do you mean 10 years? What about my wife and kid? - What about them? Well, I got a lineup hum in New York. - If you wanna live, forget them. I'm telling it is blood in your shoes right now, and you don't know it. Yeah, what is it? We're the people next door. What's going on in there? Just a family squad. But, you know, our brother here had too much vino with his dinner. That's all. Well... We called the police. I'm sorry, we didn't know. Thanks very much. Thank you, thank you. He's coming to, Smitty. - Never mind him. You gotta go. You gotta go right now. I ain't got no money. I got 10 bucks. Here... There's a whole works right here. 150 bucks here. Take it. Take my car, the blue Pontiac. - Okay. Now your best bet is to ship out. The merchant marine. - Hey, but I ain't got no papers. I got a friend who can take care of that. I friend of mine. A guy named Papadakis. They call him Pappy. - Pappy? All right. Where do I find him? - New York. Aegean Hotel, West 18th St. You got that? - Okay, Aegean Hotel, West 18th, right? And listen, park the car in the Reno Airport parking lot. And I'm gonna say that you stole it. Then get on a bus and head East. But don't take a straight line any place. And forget that bimbo that you married because you're gonna have stake out like a water hole. I'm not kidding about getting out of the country. Your life isn't worth 2? in the USA. Smitty, are you gonna be all right? - I'll be all right with a little luck. Papadakis, right? - Papadakis, yeah. And remind him he owes me a favor. - So do I. Starting now, I don't have or wanna hear from you again. Because as far as I'm concerned, you got leprosy.
