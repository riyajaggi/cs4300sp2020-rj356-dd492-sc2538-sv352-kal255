 - I was the one... - Whoa, whoa, slow down. What happened? They took all the money from the cash drawers. Only I put a GPS device in one of the bags. It's activated. C-PICK is reporting the tracking signal moving southbound on Wells Street, currently at Madison Street. Beat 5533 in pursuit. 5533, 10-4. Device now at Wells Street and Adams. Madison to Adams... They're on the El train. Beat 5533, we've go armed robbery offenders on the El Train, traveling west on the Brown Line towards the Quincy stop. Get cars to the Quincy stop now. Move, move. Chicago police. Just keep nice and calm. Clear. Evers? Clear. This is Beat 5533. We're on the Brown Line, traveling towards LaSalle and Van Buren. We're gonna need this train stopped before we get there. Police. Nice and calm. Did you guys see anything? No. No? What, we miss 'em? We miss 'em? Dispatch, where does C-PICK show our target's at? Over. 5533, C-PICK reports signal is at Van Buren and LaSalle, now moving south again. He's on the train in front of us. Dispatch, cancel that request to stop the train. Just don't freak everyone out. It's the only exit. Go! Go! Go! Go right, go right. Did you see where he went? What? No? No. I was just about to get on the train. Ambulance to the southwest corner of LaSalle and Van Buren. We've got one down with a GSW to the head. Bank tracking device right here.

Guess our robbers find the tracking device, get ready to dump it, this poor sap gets in the way and bang. Why not one more? He's already put down a security guard. We find any I.D. yet? No, no I.D., and unfortunately not much of a face either. No wallet? No, no wallet, nothing. No I.D. He came off the train that way. It's weird, right? Can you get me Lieutenant Simons at the 23rd District, please? Superintendent, we need to get going. To what? You have to remind her. The dedication? I'm afraid I'm not going. The mayor's speaking. Yes, he does that. Listen, do me a favor. You tell them that as my chief of staff you are there to show support. And if anyone complains, you mention to them that there have been two shootings and a bank robbery and a killer with an MP5 in an area where schools are about to let out. Mary. Trying him now. Any calls you need to make, we can make from the car. What are they dedicating again? A boat? A boat launch. It's on the south bank of the canal. They spent a lot of money.... Simons' on line one. There's a high school band there. There's going to be.. Lieutenant, I want to make sure we're increasing police presence in all school districts for the next few hours. Where can we pull from? So, sir, you got a look at the two robbers. I did not get a look at them. I explained that to the other cop. You already said you were standing right next to one of the robbers. Well, I was on the floor. Okay, did you see what he had on his feet? What shoes he was wearing? White sneakers. High tops. Any kind of design? Laces. Green laces. Like those? You caught him already, huh? Maybe. Uh, look, we appreciate your help. One of the guys is going to get your contact details, so just hang around. So before he lost his face, our dead guy was in on the heist. Guess his partner wanted all the money for himself. That's one way to renegotiate. Let's see if this dead guy's got a rap sheet. Best thing about being Chicago PD is having 10,000 friends. Unless, like me, you work undercover. Then you spend your whole day acting like your enemies are your friends and vice-versa. It's enough to get you mixed up on which one's which. What? You can't bluff to save your life. Sure I can. So how come you're broke? It's a tactic. Breaking down your defenses. It's already working. I'm surprised to see that you got out of bed. Bubba likes to sleep till 4:00. So? So you're lucky you got a job. What do you do? I work construction. What he means to say is, he gets paid to not do construction. Isn't that right, fat boy? There are guys on the payroll who don't come to work. So the city pays the bills and then the guys come to us... we split the paycheck. And the man in City Hall. Who's the man in City Hall? The guy who gave me this gig. My old man did Gibbons some favors once... Shut your stupid mouth! What the hell you thinking? Let me ask you, Bubba. You got money here to buy into this game. So why are you short the last two weeks? I was waiting to win it all from you. I feel like I got a rush coming on. Get the door. You think you can stiff us for two weeks running and then just come in here and play cards with us? Please! - All right, Evers, let's hear it. - Wysocki. - First on the scene. - Yo, Moose. What's up? Can't come talk to us? Man, I'm busy. What's going on? You're busy, huh? Well, I thought you might want to say good-bye to Jonesy before he retires. You're a little young to be kicking it on a pontoon boat, huh? Yeah. Tell me about it. You're a piece of work. What do you mean by that? What, I miss something? Yeah, your best buddy, Superintendent Colvin is running him off the force. This is the first I heard of it, man. It's got nothing to do with me. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, Jonesy's good police. You better get that. Might be the superintendent asking for more recommendations for her hit list. Wysocki. Hey, it's Liam. I got something for you. Are you on a secure line? Yeah. All right, go. What do you got? Hey, Evers. Rothman, what up? I hear David Mullens is looking for a new partner. I think maybe you two should team up. No one is going to blame you if you trade horses. Don't let Wysocki drag you down. Come on, kid, let's roll. Eh, Moosekian. Pearson wants to schedule a call. I told him you have the CAPS meeting. So that's probably going to run from at least 11:30 till about 12:45, knowing the way they take their time. Excuse me, everyone, I need to have a word with Detective Wysocki please. Just be a minute. Thank you. Oh. Should I...? Thank you, Bill. Next time you decide to retire a senior detective in my division, it might be nice if you gave me a heads-up. Everybody, everybody thinks I'm behind it. Are there any other decisions I should be running by you? I'm serious. Moosekian just bawled me out in front of everybody. Did he make you cry? Did it hurt your feelings? No. Jonesy and his two buddies were running a tow truck scam. All right, they were giving their friends an early heads-up about cars in distress. I didn't know. No, you wouldn't. Because Jonesy offered to resign rather than to submit to a department investigation. Although I'm sure he's spinning it to all his boys as if I'm the Wicked Witch of the West. Well, something like that, yeah. Yeah, well, it wouldn't be the first time. You said Liam called. What was it about? Hugh Killian... you familiar with him? One of the top players in the Irish mob. Hides behind some front company, right? Dansworth Construction. Him and his mob buddies are pulling the usual tricks... timesheets for no-shows, overbilling, double billing, you name it. Hey, the mob overcharges... I'm shocked. And they got a big city contract, which according to Liam, Gibbons made happen. What do you mean "made happen"? Well, he's not on it officially, but according to Liam, he's behind it, pulling the strings and taking his cut. Do we have proof? Well, if an overheard conversation between two Irish drunks is proof, yeah. If only it were, my God, the job would be so much easier. So? Come on, we can do something about this. Look, I was positive that Gibbons was the one who tried to kill me. Who killed Antonio, all right? But I was wrong, and quite frankly, so were you. What are you saying? I'm saying how do we know anything about him? Really, how do we know? We feel it. You feel it? Yeah. This is all innuendo. You know, Saddam Hussein never even had WMDs, but he let the world think that he did. Why? Because it made him seem more powerful. What if Gibbons is doing the same thing? What if he's just encouraging these rumors, letting everyone think that he has wiseguy connections so that no one crosses him? What if it's exactly as it looks like? All right, let's test your theory then. We'll go hard on the construction site. We'll get city inspectors from building, electrical, licensing, sanitation. Good. If Gibbons reacts, we know he's in on it. Exactly. You know what? And you get Ernie's team to issue moving violations to every truck that rolls through. You want organized crimes writing the tickets on this? Well, sends a message, don't you think? He's not going to like it. What, you think it should be someone else? No. I think Ernie's the right guy for this. All right. Let's clap our hands... see if Gibbons jumps. Got an I.D. on our faceless bank robber. James T. Littleton. Did time in Stateville. Twice for armed robbery, once for vehicular hijacking. Well, he's certainly got the pedigree. Also, I called the hospital to check on our security guard, and she's in surgery. So... Okay. Uh, are you okay? Why? All that crap with Jonesy and Moosekian getting in your face... No. I wouldn't worry about the Moose. Karma sent him to a construction site with a book full of tickets. Right. So check it out. I pulled the contact cards for Littleton... to find his running mates. His last two street stops were with this solid citizen... Samuel Robbins. Long rap sheet. Even better than that, the prosecutor on his last arrest said he spent six months in a psych ward. Violent and crazy. Why do these two always like to mix? No known address on this guy. Of course. Okay, let's pay faceless's pad a visit, see what we can dig up about his nutso friend. That's our dead guy's car. Plates match. Sleeping bag, bunch of clothes. Somebody's taking a road trip. Hood's warm. Beat 5533, requesting cars to 1650 West Harlem. We've got a possible on the offender from the bank robbery. 5533, 10-4. Available units to 1650 West Harlem. 15 in a ten? 15 in a ten?! Yes, sir. And by my math, that's five miles per hour more than the posted limit. You're in plainclothes. Organized crime division. Should be doing real police work. So how come you're writing tickets? Trust me, we're almost as annoyed as you are. Units in two, we have a request from 5533. All available units to 1650 West Harlem. Possible suspect sighting. Go ahead, 52. 5533... that's Jarek. As much as I'd love to hightail it over there, your uncle gave us a job to do, so we're gonna do it. Excuse me while a write a parking ticket. That's him... that's Samuel Robbins. That's him. Where's the backup? We're going in, let's go. Police! Stop! Squad 10-1, 1650 West Harlem! Send all available cars now! Send cars! I can't get a shot off. Sweetie, move out of the way! Behind the car! I'll cover you, okay? Evers, talk to me! What's going on, man?! He's gone. Squad, where's the backup?! Yeah! Congratulations, fellas. 29 and 1 record, state championship. I expect to see some of y'all playing for the Bulls one day, right? Uh-uh-uh, after you go to college and get a degree. Agreed? There's some gifts waiting on you guys outside, okay? Go get 'em. Good job. Congratulations. Keep those grades up. Keep those grades up. Make sure they get everything they need out there, all right? Thank you. Appreciate it. Ronin, do you know anything about city departments cracking down on job sites? No. Why? I just got a phone call. The Benton Street project's getting hassled. For what? Sounds like petty stuff to me. Don't I have an appointment with the superintendent later on? Yes, you do. Make sure you come with. 300 rounds of armor-piercing ammo. Oh, my God, you got to be kidding. No wonder he was shooting at us, huh? We got his whole haul from the bank job. He was desperate and trigger-happy before. What's he going to be like now? 20 minutes after I call... now you just what, stroll up, huh? Go easy, man. Easy! Easy to put you in a hospital. And me and my partner and a little girl almost got our heads shot off! We're the first ones here? Yes, you're the first ones here. All you missed was some guy spraying the neighborhood with a submachine gun. And thanks to you, he got away. Wysocki, we were halfway across town when the call came in. There's three other units who should be here. Moosekian's crew was the closest? Where are they? All right, where's Moosekian? Somewhere else. Fine, Thomas. I'm going to start with you. Where were you when the "officer needs assistance" call went out? Which call was that? Well, you were either out of your car with both your radios turned off, or you and I have a very serious problem. Oh, because you both heard it, didn't you? You all heard the call. But none of you answer. You left my partner and I to get our asses shot off! Give me one reason why I shouldn't wipe the floor with you! Look, we weren't trying to get you hurt. It's about the guys being run off the force lately. Moosekian said you're feeding names to the superintendent. Said we should freeze you out for a day or two, to show a little solidarity. Solidarity? Yeah. And I'm really sorry. Tell Moosekian I'm looking for him. All right, last item... three burglaries in the past month, near Shaw, right around Brook Street. We'll pay special attention to that neighborhood. That's what I want to hear. Thank you. Anything else? Oh, we've taken enough of your time. Good to see you again. Thank you, Alderman. Oh, actually, Superintendent, there is one more little thing. Yes? Wait, we're not done? It's just a little thing. Dansworth Construction. They've got a building on Benton Street. They feel they've been targeted with excessive fines and ticketing. I'm sorry, Benton Street... is that, is that site in your ward? No, no, it's not. I'm not sure where your interest in this project lies. Where it is again? It's Benton and 23rd. Well, what I can tell you is I've got a lot of constituents in my ward who are construction workers... carpenters, truckers. They need those jobs, Teresa, desperately. Now it seems to me, in this economy we should be doing everything we can do to help those people stay in their jobs. But, look, this is your call. And I respect that. I can call the Department of Building... I'll take another look at it. Thanks again. Sure. And you too, Mr. Hampton. Alderman. Thank you. I didn't mean to step on your toes. If you want to call the D.O. B. Yourself, that's great. Just ask them to go easy on this one construction site and then we'll tell them... I'd like them to shut it down. Shut it down? The alderman who controls this entire department's purse strings just asked us to lay off. I am aware, and I'm asking you to have the site closed. This is about Gibbons, right? Look, I know I was forced on you by the mayor's office, but I can't be useful to you unless you share your thoughts. Look, when I have proof, I will bring you up to speed, I promise. But until then, it's best if I handle this on my own. You mean with Wysocki. It's not personal, Bill. I know that. I'll call them and tell them you want the site closed. Thank you. Thank you so much. All right, bye-bye. Who's that? Robbins' old doctor at the psych ward. I told her that he had shot two people and robbed a bank. She told me she wasn't even surprised. He's paranoid, delusional, doesn't trust anyone. Did she say why they let him out? Yeah, the treatment was too expensive. It's cheaper to chase him, huh? Unbelievable. Something on your mind, kid? No. Yes. The deal that you have with the superintendent, where you get to take whatever case you want... Yeah, what about it? Well, I think it's great that we get to take over all these high-profile cases and then you get to oversee the entire investigation... But? But it puts us on the outside of everybody else. So? Superintendent Colvin's not winning any popularity contests right now. Your point? Moose isn't the only one talking smack. Guys from the locker room, guys... buddies of mine from my old district. Think I'm Teresa's snitch, huh? And as your partner... As my partner... well, that doesn't have to be a permanent situation, kid. We're not married. Okay, hold on. I'm just asking... do you think that it's all worth it? I want to do my job. But if we can't even trust other cops to have our backs, this job gets dangerous. Yes, it does. All units on Citywide, shots fired at 310 North Williams Street. Looking for a white male... Could be our guy. Hang on. You're clear up here on the right. All right, what's going on? Neighbors heard shots fired, called it in. We're taking fire from whoever's inside. Fully automatic weapon? Something smaller. Ooh! That doesn't sound like our guy. No, well, we got his ammo. So maybe he got himself a handgun. All right, you guys are going to take the rear. We're going to go in the front door, okay? All right, you good? All right, let's go. Police! Drop the gun! Hands! Hands! Hands! Hands! I thought he was trying to kill me. What happened? I got held up, but only had $50. This guy was saying he would come back and kill me. How long ago? A few minutes ago. The offender fled the building out the back. You guys see anything? Recognize any of these guys? This is the guy! This one? Yes. Who is he? You can still take it though. Hang on, I'll be back in a second. Better late than never, huh? I came by to say I'm sorry. Yeah? For what? A dozen officers failed to show up and your own niece was one of them. Moosekian definitely gave that order though? Yeah, of course he did. What if something had happened? It's fine. Nothing happened. Yeah, but if something had... It's fine. It's okay. Nothing happened all right? Any of the guys just busting your chops about me? Don't worry, I don't stick up for you. That's a good plan. Seriously though, just keep a low profile... until I get this sorted out. You don't need to be paying my bills. No, thank you. Superintendent, you know my niece. Superintendent. Officer Wysocki. Nice to see you. Excuse us, please. Sure. You're always chasing people off. You ever notice that? I'm just saying. Gibbons came by today. Asked me to go easy on Dansworth Construction. Indirectly, of course. What'd you do? Shut the site down. So now Killian's blaming Gibbons. I think it's time we had a chat with Killian. You let Evers take the lead here. Tell him you'll catch up. Ride with me. How about you tell me where we're going, and I'll get myself there. Yeah, you look like the kind of guy that would know where Hugh Killian is. Huh? Is he here? Am I right? Work off some of that weight and go and fetch him, huh? And you know the drill, so why don't you just beat it. Make sure Gibbons hears about this. What's the commotion? This place is known for its peaceful ambiance. I'm sure. We're just about to sit down. Why don't you join us? You tried the food here? They got a shepherd's pie that'll blow your mind. Not to mention it could feed a small village. I think we'll pass, buddy. We're here to talk about Dansworth Construction. I'm more... a silent partner now. Really? So then you won't mind if the construction site on Benton Street is closed permanently. See, we don't even really need to arrest you. Just dry up your income, put a serious cramp in your lifestyle. Yeah, you must have a pretty steep dry-cleaning bill... fancy suit like that. Since you two sat down here, I've been waiting patiently, I think you'd agree, to hear what the hell it is you want. Here it is. You've been working with a city official, someone who's supposed to be protecting you from all of this. That's who we want. You give us a name, we'll back off of you. I do business with hundreds of city officials. I wouldn't know where to start. Think it over. And when the money dries up, ask yourself who your friends really are. She just got out of surgery. She's not supposed to have visitors yet. We understand, okay? We just... we're trying to catch the man that did this. Time is of the essence; just a couple of questions. Please. Please. Just don't upset her. We won't, we won't. Let's go. How you doing? Ethel, I'm Detective Wysocki, and this is Detective Evers. Just gonna show you a couple of pictures for you to take a look at. Do you recognize any of these men? They were wearing masks during the robbery, but did you see any of them in the bank in the days leading up to it? Mm-mm. No? What do you remember from the robbery? Someone, someone took my gun. These two men. Uh, they made me help them with the cash drawers. Yeah. Uh, one of them hit me over the head, and then he shot me. And then he shot you. Why do you think he shot you? He thought I hit the alarm. He shot you because you hit the alarm? The shots were fired before the alarm went off. According to our witnesses. Which one was it? Did the alarm go off before or after you were shot? Um... It's okay. No, it's okay. Just think. Please, just think. Okay, I'm sorry, we have to stop. Did the shots go off and then the alarm or... Excuse me, you have to stop. You're not even supposed to be here. No, it's okay, seriously. Sorry. She's in pain. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Nurse? She lying to us? Yeah, I think so. Well, you know, I can think of, uh, smarter places for us to meet. Come to think of it, that'd be most other places in the city. I wanted you to see this for yourself. Seven grand a day just to rent the machinery we got in there. It'd be nice to know when we'll turn it back on. Now, there must be a reason that Teresa's targeting you. Either somebody on your end spilled the beans or... You do your job, and I'll do mine. And your job is to protect us from that bitch. I spoke with Teresa. I specifically mentioned this site. Then she puts a lock across the gate. What does that say about your pull with the superintendent? For all we know, you're the reason she's clamping down. You know something I don't? Plenty. Well, then why don't you... Let's stay on topic. You told me you helped her get the job because you could control her. This your idea of control? Put your house in order. Don't you threaten me, Hugh. It's not productive and it's not polite. Hey! You're used to being the man who gives orders. But when you're dealing with me, it's about leverage. Who needs the other guy more. Who's got more to lose. You understand? So I'm telling you it's your job to fix it. Right now... it's your only job. Because if I wake up one day and decide I don't need you... that changes everything. You and I... we have different priorities, and that's fine. But we also have a lot in common. How's that? You've worked with heavy hitters. You carry a lot of responsibility. You'd think. Mr. Hampton, you're Teresa Colvin's chief of staff. I respect Teresa. But she's got her favorites. Just like anyone, I guess. I get the feeling you're not one of them. And neither are you, as a matter of fact. Yeah, I... get that feeling, too. Mind if I take one? Ah, please, please. Cuban. Nice, ah. Uh-huh. You mind if I get to it? No. You want to know what Teresa's next move is on the Dansworth Construction project. Maybe we can discuss what I want and what I'm willing to do. I am listening. I'd need a monthly stipend. Off the books, of course, and in cash. In return, I'll keep you one step ahead of the superintendent. And when she's gone, you put me up for the super job. You have a number in mind for these services you're intending on providing? Mr. Hampton... I can't tell you how happy I am you stopped by. With your sister recovering from her surgery, we thought maybe you could answer some questions for us. Yeah, of course. Do you know who this gentleman is? No, I've never seen him. Is he the one who shot her? Yeah. Samuel Robbins. They went to high school together. Same year. I don't recognize him. They couldn't have been friends. No? They sat in the same classes. Couple of the same committees. Yearbook committee, was it? Your sister's been having some financial problems... is that right? She lost her house. Half the people in this neighborhood lost houses. Wait, now, Ethel's doing good. She lives with us; she works her butt off. She's in that hospital fighting for her life. Now, what are you trying to tell me? That she's a bank robber? Why'd he shoot her, then? Robbins robbed a bank with another man, shot him and killed him right afterwards. Did you speak with Ethel yesterday? Did you speak with Ethel yesterday? We were set to celebrate my daughter's birthday, and she got called into work. That's what she told you? What do you mean, told me? Ethel didn't work yesterday; we spoke to the bank manager. No, I was right here... the phone rang, and it was someone from the bank. That phone? Alderman. Lieutenant. Where is he? He's inside. He says he only wants to talk to you. Anybody else know about this? No, it's just me and my man. Finally! Where were you? Would you give us some privacy for a moment? I just got the call... what the hell happened here? They arrested me! For what? They found child pornography in my garage. What? It's not mine. Whose is it, then? They planted it to frame me. Who? Superintendent Colvin or someone working for her. They can't get me by playing it straight, so she sets me up. Thinks she can squeeze me into giving up your name. Nah, nah, nah, I don't think so. You don't think what? Teresa Colvin's got way too much integrity to frame someone. Nah, nah, nah, I'm not buying that. Can you get me out of this? Probably, but what good would that do, if we don't figure out who did this to you? You think it was someone in my crew? No. You keep all those fellas in line, right? Yeah. Well, who, then? Could be somebody else close to you. There is no one! Now, think, Hugh, think. Somebody else... really close to you. I mean... really, really, really close to you. You did this to me? Lieutenant Kelly? Yes, Alderman? What's the mandatory sentence for possession of child pornography? It's a minimum eight years, uh, but there's a lot of nasty stuff in there. You know, jury sees that and... You son of a bitch. And how do kiddy lovers tend to get treated in prison, Lieutenant Kelly? Not well, really. I would say, uh, not well. You... both of you... you think you're doing this to me? What I think is that you're in a lot of trouble, Hugh. And I'm asking you, would you like my help? I'm gonna end you. Why are you getting mad? All I did was take your lesson to heart. My lesson? About leverage. About who needs who more. Now would you like my help, Hugh? Or should I have Lieutenant Kelly here make an arrest? I'd like your help. Say it like you mean it, Hugh. I would like your help. Good. Because I really want to give it to you. But understand... Lieutenant Kelly and his friends are going to hold on to that evidence, in case the relationship between you and I should deteriorate. Or if something... anything... should happen to me or my loved ones, and I mean anything. Am I understood? Completely. Very good. Lieutenant Kelly, let's get rid of all that pornographic garbage. Put everything back where we found it, and let Mr. Killian here get back to his evening. Yes, sir. Hugh... nice house. Thanks. Heard you had a breakthrough. Yeah, we did. We got an address on the shooter... we're heading there now. All right. Well, let me know how it goes. I will. You got any updates on our friendly alderman? Not yet. At least now we know who we're dealing with. Just a matter of time before everyone else knows, too. Stay safe. Will do. I was watching the stuff... It was very, very, very close. We'll get them international exposure. Alderman. Teresa. I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning. I'm here on a matter... It's important. This is Assistant U.S. Attorney Desmond Harris. Good to meet you. This is William Hampton, my chief of staff. Why don't we move into my office. Teresa, this should probably be a private meeting. Just the three of us. Well, Bill is my chief of staff. Anything that we have... For the purpose of this conversation, Mr. Hampton should not be present. What's going on? Bill, would you excuse us, please? So what's this about? Well, given some of the conversations you and I have had recently, there's something you should hear before I have to speak to the press. Speak to the press about what? Corruption inside your administration. What kind of corruption? Play the tape. ...construction project. Maybe we can discuss what I want and what I'm willing to do. William Hampton, your chief of staff. I need a monthly stipend... off the books, of course, and in cash. In return, I'll keep you one step ahead of the superintendent. And when she's gone, you put me up for the super job. All right. Given how serious this is, Teresa... your chief of staff soliciting a bribe... you understand my obligation to go public, right? You look good. New fashion statement. Detective. Sergeant. What's our status? Fill him in, Evers. We checked his phone history, and the call to our wounded bank guard came from Apartment 4-D in this building. It's registered to an old lady. She's just renting the place out. Does not live on the premises. Okay, is anyone in there? No idea. We're going to take the lead. You two are going to follow. Moose, Sanchez, you cover the back. Is that good with you? Yeah. All right, let's do it. All right... We gonna yell "Police"? You just did. Police! Go! Go! Go! Chicago Police! CPD! Clear. Clear. Clear. The back door's open. Moose, you see anything out there? We got shots fired! Shots fired in the back! Keep behind me. Call it. As an elected representative of this great city, I cannot and I will not stay quiet in the face of such a blatant betrayal of my constituents. Now this... corruption took place in the office of the police superintendent of this city, at the highest level, makes this an outrage and a violation that needs to be addressed. And let me say, on behalf of the people of Chicago, we will not stand for this! Damn it! Superintendent, are you okay? I'm fine! I'm fine. You know the bright side of this? Mandatory days off. Officer-involved shooting. Yeah, right after the paperwork and the prostate exam. Wysocki. Couple things to say. Obviously, thanks... for keeping that clown from putting a few extra holes in me. You know, when I told the guys to freeze you out for a couple days, I never meant to put you in danger. It was stupid. I was way out of line. And I'm sorry. I really am. So? So? So, are we cool? What are you doing?! What are you doing?! Wysocki... What are you doing?! I just apologized! You didn't hear me?! We could have arrested the guy! We could have arrested him! Instead I killed a man because you were playing games! Get off of me! Yeah. Roger, this is Detective Wysocki. Wysocki, this is Lieutenant Kelly, my new chief of staff. Heard a lot about you. Congrats on the job. Thank you. Wish I got it under different circumstances, but I guess I shouldn't complain. While I have you both here, there's something that I wanted to say. It's about Ronin Gibbons. Yeah, I saw the press conference... Jarek, just please. Let me just say this. You know, for a long time, I was convinced that Gibbons was guilty of any number of crimes. And I tried everything I could to prove it. Without any success. Now I'm embarrassed that it's taken me this long to see it, but while I might not like the way he operates, he's not breaking any laws. So, from here on out, the witch hunt is over. All right, we're just going to focus on protecting this city from the real criminals. Now does anyone have a problem with that? Jarek? No. Good. All right, you have that case file for me? The uh... Which one? You were going to walk me through the case file. Yes, right here. Yeah. This will just take a minute. Sure. Hey, look forward to working with you. Absolutely. Good luck. All right, so found out where the guy lives. Why don't you trust him? He was forced on me. He's supposedly the mayor's choice, only I don't think the mayor's ever even heard of him. Then I learned Kelly spent the first five years on the force working in Gibbons' ward. Okay, so we got to be careful what we say around headquarters. Yeah, but on the bright side, he doesn't know that we're onto him, so we can funnel any intel we want to Gibbons. That's not exactly taking Gibbons on head to head. I don't mind sucker-punching Gibbons, as long as it knocks him out. Carry on, Detective. Okay, boss. Sync and correction by GeirDM for www.addic7ed.com
