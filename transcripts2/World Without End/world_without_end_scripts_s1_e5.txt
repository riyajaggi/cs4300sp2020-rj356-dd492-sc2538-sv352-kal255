 World Without End (2012): Season 1, Episode 5 - A People Revolt - full transcript 
 It is now 7 years later and Caris hears from Merthin who lives in Florence and is married and has a child. She continues practicing medicine and cares for Gwenda's son who is injured. Sister Meir sees Brother Thomas and Brother Matthias together in bed but after consulting Caris, decides to say nothing. Thank to a bequest left to the convent, Caris now has the funds to build her hospice. Prior Godwin schemes to get his hands on the money. Caris seeks assistance from the king, who is still in France in what is seemingly a never-ending war with the French. Surrounded by their enemies, the King's main concern is to find a way to get his men back to England.

 Seven hellish years at war for this.
 The French have us surrounded, Majesty.
 They are attacking us constantly.
 from three sides, not four.
 Get us across the fucking river
and we can get our army home!
 But we cannot cross the Somme, sire.
 So we sit here, fighting off their forays,
and starving through the winter?
 Majesty, the french have
burned all the bridges.
 There's nowhere to cross the damn river.
 There must be a ford.
 The french are still well supplied,
but the farms are across the river.
 -It stands to reason...
-Enough!
 -...that the french army supplies...
-Enough!
 The question remains,
 how do we cross the Somme
and get the army back to England?
 Anyone?
 The river's narrow at Abbeyville.
 The French know that, too.
They will expect us there.
 Not if we get there before them.
 How long a march?
 -Three days.
-At least.
 Force it. Get us there in two.
 Look! Look!
 Ma, there's a man making fire over there.
Can we go and see?
 Yeah, but watch out for your brother.
 Keep an eye on them. I'm off to find Caris.
 They're old enough to be on their own.
 Keep an eye on them.
 Gwenda!
 -Hello, Sister.
-Hello.
 -I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
-No.
 I've brought you a fresh supply of feverwort
from Wigleigh forest.
 Oh, wonderful.
 Let's go back to the convent, I'll pay you.
 Ladies and gentlemen,
 come to the best in Kingsbridge!
 He uses this to make fire. I saw.
 Sam, be careful.
 Don't be a baby, David.
 Damn it!
 Maybe it is magic.
 What do you know?
 Come on, I'm hungry.
 Ladies and gentlemen!
 Hey!
 What are you doing in my oven, boy?
Stealing my pies?
 Hold it still, boy. Hold it still.
 And Wulfric, how is he?
 Angrier than ever.
 We work the land that is rightfully Wulfric's.
 -But Perkin pays us nothing but food.
-That's despicable.
 Makes Wulfric a misery to live with.
 If this is love, it's a lot different
than I ever dreamt it would be.
 Gwenda!
 Sister Caris!
 Gwenda!
 Come now!
 Hold him. Hold him still.
 I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know.
 Why didn't you watch him?
 He snuck away.
 You said you'd keep an eye on them.
 Gwenda, not now.
 It's all right, son.
 I know.
 Oh, God.
 We're going to need a poultice.
Use Spanish aloe.
 Well,
 in the worst case he'll have a nasty scar
he can show his own children.
 Warn them not to steal meat pies.
 Thank you.
 Gregory, greetings.
 What a pleasant surprise.
I've been told of your arrival.
 Come in. I'll have some refreshments.
 No, no, Prior.
 For once I'm not here to see you,
I have business with Mother Cecilia.
 Perhaps later.
 Sorry to keep you waiting, Gregory.
How may I help you?
 -And who is this?
-Sister Elizabeth.
 I was told you wish to see our treasurer also.
 Ah, yes. Thank you, Mother.
 I have some very sad news.
 I've come from the deathbed
of your cousin Marilyn Smith in Hereford.
 Oh, dear. God rest her soul.
 Was she in much pain?
 It was a gentle death.
 A priest was with her when I arrived.
 She sent you this.
 One hundred and fifty gold coins
that she bequeathed to the convent.
 There was no time to draw up any paperwork,
she was fading fast.
 God bless Marilyn.
 If you think this hurt,
just imagine what hell is like.
 Come on, nothing more to see.
Go and get some fresh air.
 Come on, David.
 Try not to lose him this time.
 Thank you again.
 Thank you for the herbs.
 What are you writing?
 An account of what we did.
 I always keep a record of the visitors.
 And that way, if they come back,
 I know how I treated them
and what works and what doesn't.
 Come, have a look.
 These are some of our
most valuable treasures that we have.
 -Books?
-Foreign books.
 Filled with the most incredible knowledge.
 -I got them from a Spanish trader.
-That's Spanish?
 Well, it's Latin, translated from the Arabic.
 These writers are physicians. They know
more about the healing arts than we do.
 It's all in these books.
 It's amazing.
 Are you sure they're not written by the Devil?
 Quite sure.
 I keep telling her
she should write her own book.
 Well, compared to these people,
I don't know anything.
 But yours will be in English.
 Sister Caris, may I have a word?
 I'm proud of you, Caris.
 I know this was not your first calling,
but you've made a very fine nun.
 Thank you.
 So I'd like to reward you
by giving you even more work.
 As you wish.
 God has blessed us with the funds
to build your hospice.
 Holger! Holger!
 -Luke Webber.
-Are we going to be in England soon?
 Nearly there.
 Your Papa and Mama in Kingsbridge
will be glad to see you, eh.
 Thank you.
 Give the men a rest, feed them,
 and when the train arrives
we'll cross the river.
 Very well, sire.
 Break ranks!
 They said it couldn't be done.
 I can practically smell England,
we're so close.
 Praise God we're almost home, sire.
 They've outflanked us.
 They've outflanked us.
 Your Majesty!
 Your Majesty, the French,
they've outflanked us.
 They hold the northern part of the river.
 So now we're totally surrounded.
 Damn them to hell.
 Congratulations.
 Prior. You startled me.
 Gregory Longfellow just told me
he brought a bequest.
 Good news.
 May I see?
 Mother Cecilia's cousin will certainly have
a fine room in heaven
 with all the prayers she's bought.
 Has she said how she intended to spend it?
 Yes, indeed.
 I'm expanding Sister Caris's hospice.
 You've had some time
in which to build your palace, Prior,
 but it seems you prefer hoarding silver
to spending it.
 Conserving it, Mother.
 It would be an act of ungodly hubris to start
a project that I am unable to complete.
 How saintly.
 Now if you wouldn't mind.
 Thank you.
 Lock it up tight, Sister.
 Thieves are everywhere.
 He'll be fine tomorrow.
 Where's Wulfric?
 Wasting money we don't have.
 He does love you, Gwenda.
 As much as you love him.
 Caris?
 Do you miss Merthin?
 I think of him.
 But Mother Cecilia does her best
to keep me thinking of someone else.
 Who's that?
 God.
 Thank you.
 Aren't you going to tell me
anything about it?
 I'll tell you something about it
when you stop asking me about it.
 Why do you always say that?
 Are you all right?
 You seem distant.
 I saw Brother Thomas
and Brother Matthias together.
 What do you mean?
 They were together in bed.
 Godwyn must never find out.
 Do you approve?
 It's considered a mortal sin.
 They're good men
 and they don't deserve
Godwyn's punishment.
 I agree.
 It's not as if they are betraying wives.
 And I wonder if God really minds.
 If it's for love.
 Someone to see you, Sister Caris.
 -Signor Caroli!
-Hello, Caris.
 How good to see you. Have you returned
for some more of our wool?
 The finest in the world.
 And how does Florence fare? Are you safe?
 From the Great Mortality?
 And is it true what they say? That you
go to bed well and wake up dying?
 An exaggeration perhaps but, si, yes,
 it can be quick.
 Though it doesn't like the cold
so you are safe here in England.
 I brought you a letter.
 From Merthin.
 Thank you.
 Dearest Caris,
 I am living in Florence, married,
and blessed with a child.
 I am a builder here.
 Quite a successful one.
 -Lulalulina?
-Papa!
 And though I love my wife and daughter,
 you continue to hold a special place
in my heart.
 I have drunk far too much wine tonight,
else I could never have written this.
 But Signor Caroli, I know,
is travelling to Kingsbridge,
 which gives me a perfect excuse to tell you...
 ...that I never stop thinking of you.
 How I wish things had been different.
 How I wish I had been able
to bring you with me.
 But I was younger and impulsive,
 and though I may never see you again
I want you to know
 how much you remain part of my life.
 Pray for me, dear Caris.
 Yours forever.
 Go away. We mustn't be seen together.
 I don't think Sister Mair will tell.
She would have said something by now.
 We can't risk it.
 I love you, Matthias.
 How can I love you, Thomas?
 I've told you everything about myself,
but I know so little about you.
 You keep it all hidden.
 If I told you, your life would be endangered.
 I've already lost my soul.
 What's a life compared to that?
 What are you doing here? Get out!
You are not permitted to be here.
 May we have it back then?
 Have what back?
 The money.
 Your accomplice here
has seen the error of her ways.
 I assume you've kept it safe.
 -Why do you need it?
-The hospice, of course.
 I've written to the Bishop.
 He's given permission
for us to start immediately.
 You went behind my back?
 I consulted a higher authority.
 This is Priory money.
 Marilyn left the money
specifically to the convent.
 Do you have that in writing?
 Do you?
 Oh, how unfortunate.
 You may leave.
 Godwyn will drive me to seek solace
in the arms of the Devil!
 Would that we had the power
to be rid of him.
 Wait, you met the King.
 Many years ago. Why?
 Could you get an order from him?
 That the Priory must use the funds
to build the hospice.
 Otherwise, this will never end with Godwyn.
 Our vital work can never be achieved.
 I want you to go to him in France.
 Well, I doubt he'd even see me,
 -and even if he did...
-Make your preparations.
 What is it, love?
 Doctor!
 It's urgent!
 Go away! There's nothing to be done!
 My wife has the pestilence!
 Yes, it's come to Florence!
 There must be remedies!
 Only two!
 Hope and Prayer!
 What happened?
 The English came...
 ...and murdered everyone.
 God have mercy.
 Do you know where the English
went from here, Mother?
 We're looking for the King.
 It's easy to find them.
 Follow the path of the dead.
 Thank you, Mother.
 -Good morning, Brother.
-Mother Cecilia.
 Fine day for hunting.
 Indeed.
 Have you heard from Sister Caris?
 Not since her arrival in France.
 Is there something
you wish to say to me, Brother?
 You have no idea what you sent her into,
do you?
 It's a dangerous mission,
but it's for the glory of God.
 Who will, I trust, protect her.
 Have you ever been in a war, Mother?
 It's easy for people at a distance
to believe that God is on their side,
 but in the midst of battle
I've never known Him to be benevolent.
 You still trust him.
 Yes, I do.
 But in spite of war.
 I guess I will never forget
the horrors that I've seen.
 Caris is used to blood.
 She's used to mercy.
 There's little of that on the battlefield.
 Sister?
 Caris, take my hand!
 I've got you. You're all right.
 You're all right.
 It's horrific
what we've done to these people.
 At least God's on our side.
 Is he?
 Do you really think that
God cares who lives or dies?
 He wasn't in that well.
 He's everywhere.
 What if we're wrong?
 What if God's just a story
that we've made up,
 to give ourselves comfort?
 Come, now.
 No.
 If it's done for love,
 God doesn't mind.
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
 You're English?
 Yes.
 Where are you from?
 From Kingsbridge.
 Really?
 How many steeples does the Cathedral have?
 Two towers, one steeple.
 You sisters are a long way from home.
 You'd best come with us.
It's the only way you will be safe.
 Look what we've got here.
 Three godforsaken weeks
 and still no way forward,
 still no plan.
 You are generals, are you not?
 Experts in the art of war.
 Sire, there are no simple solutions.
 Our backs are to the river,
 and the French are closing in
on three sides...
 Our longbows have the power
to bring these bastards to their knees.
 We should be using them to our advantage...
 To bring the longbows within range,
we must first cross the river.
 The French know that!
 What is the strategy?
 Save siege, starvation
and the certain annihilation of my army?
 Majesty, an envoy from the French King
arrived this morning.
 He offers you terms.
 You mean terms of surrender?
 Sire,
 Philip and his main army
will be here by noon tomorrow.
 We can neither advance nor retreat.
 We will be totally surrounded.
 So this is how it ends?
 Surrender my crown to Philip,
 have my name cursed through the ages
 and all to suffer an ignoble death,
 alone in a dungeon like my father.
 What say you, Sir Henry?
 I see no choice but to accept.
 I need a moment to consider your counsel.
 Your Majesty?
 What joke is this?
 A nun come to cleanse my soul
before it's sold?
 I treated your arm in Kingsbridge.
 I removed a fragment of arrow.
 So you did.
 But as a woman, not a nun.
 That I do remember.
 How is your arm?
 Of little consequence today.
 Your Majesty,
I was sent here to petition you...
 Petition me?
 What idiot would send you
on such a mission?
 Well, God has, Your Majesty.
 The Prior steals convent money,
 -and without your help...
-Please!
 I care not for church squabbles
on a day such as this.
 Forgive me, sire. But I have travelled
a long way in search of you.
 I have seen the horrors
that men inflict upon each other
 and I would bear it all again
if you might hear my plea.
 I understand
that it is of little consequence to a king.
 But as you have your duty,
I'm afraid I have mine.
 And do you think you know the duties
that burden a king?
 No.
 I can't begin to fathom
what you must go through.
 But duty is a burden that we all must bear,
 I'm afraid.
 And as you cannot walk away from yours,
I cannot walk away from mine.
 Your name?
 Caris Wooler.
 Caris Wooler.
 Your spirit and heart
are all that I love of England.
 If I am still King after tomorrow,
 I will grant your petition.
 So, it seems I have no choice
but to bow down in defeat
 to that preening French prick
and hand him my crown.
 Well, that same crown says
I have no choice but to refuse his terms.
 We will attack the French
across the river at dawn.
 Attack, sire? But Sir Henry...
 I will hear no "buts"!
 This is no day for cowards or politicians.
 The last thing the French will expect
is an attack from a defeated army...
 You say our bowmen can win the day?
 Yes, Your Majesty.
 Then all we need do is bring them into range.
 A small party could cross
under cover of darkness
 and dispatch their sentries,
 making a safer path
for our longbows to ford the river.
 It is a bold plan, but if it fails
the King will withdraw his terms.
 Then so be it.
 Stealth, cunning and English resolve
may yet win this day.
 Who's bold enough
to grasp this opportunity?
 I am, Your Majesty.
 Sire, the French will hear them coming.
 Not if they're careful and silent.
 Move your men slowly,
 like French snails.
 Remember, slow and silent.
 Yes, sire.
 Godspeed.
 Come on.
 Let's go.
 Ready?
 Follow me.
 You go, men.
 Go! With stealth! With stealth!
 Prepare my armour!
 Forward, into position.
 Nock and draw!
 Nock and draw!
 Nock and draw!
 Loose!
 Take cover!
 Draw!
 Loose!
 For England!
 For England!
 Charge!
 No quarter given! No quarter!
 For England!
 Sister Caris!
 Was that your prayers or my arrows?
 Either way you owe God his petition.
 Oh, it's his petition now, is it?
 Boy!
 Here you are.
 I shall visit Kingsbridge again
 and see how you have fared.
 If it pleases you.
 It does.
 Thank you.
 You're very welcome.
 Onwards! It's time to go home!
