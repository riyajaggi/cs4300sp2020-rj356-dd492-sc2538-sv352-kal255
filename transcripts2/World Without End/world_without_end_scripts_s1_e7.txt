 Mother Caris, Merthin. Brother Matthias and Brother Thomas set out in Btother Godwyn footsteps to recover the gold he stole. When they catch up to him, they find him the sole survivor of ...

 Do you think any of them will still be alive
when we get there?
 Brother Joseph said that only a few had died
when he left.
 Do you think I'm being mercenary?
 No. It's the Priory's money
and Godwyn stole it.
 How do we know it's even there?
 Well, Godwyn's there,
and wherever Godwyn goes...
 We should be there by this time tomorrow.
 You're a fine cook, Merthin.
 One learns when one lives alone.
 Why are you smiling?
 Just all suddenly seems so real.
 -What does?
-My hospice.
 Your hospice? I have to design and build it.
 I rather thought of it as ours.
 Where is Brother Matthias?
 He's taking a long time, don't you think?
 Thank you for coming.
 Why did you ask me?
 Well, we need you, and
you're one of the few people I trust.
 And do you still trust me,
 now that we're alone,
 at night, in the forest?
 Don't tease me, Merthin.
 I'm tempting, I'm not teasing.
 Priors are not easily tempted.
 You're no ordinary Prior.
 And I'm no ordinary temptation.
 Stop it. They'll be back.
 Which is why I must be direct.
 I'll go.
 Is everything all right?
 Yes. It was nothing.
 Good night.
 Good night.
 Your Majesty?
 Your Majesty!
 Forgive me.
 What? What is it?
 Terrible news.
 Get out.
 Get out!
 What? What is it?
 Tell me.
 The Princess Joan, passing through France
on her way to Castile,
 met the Great Mortality.
 She is dead.
 No, no!
 No!
 Here we are at last.
 There's someone in here.
 It's the fumes of our excrement
that ward off the disease.
 It saved me. The others wouldn't listen.
 That's something
your infidel physicians don't know.
 Whose grave is outside?
 It's Brother Saul, he was the first to die.
 And you'll join him soon if you don't join me.
Please come.
 Where's the Priory's money, Godwyn?
 I ate it.
 I think it would be better
if we keep this to ourselves.
 What will we do with him?
 Bring him back with us, I'm afraid.
 But we must first give these people
a Christian burial.
 Absolutely.
 -Over there.
-Very well.
 What are you doing?
 No, this is holy ground!
 No!
 No! No! No!
 Give it to me! No! No!
 Stop!
 Get off him.
 Get off him.
 He bit me. He bit me.
 It's all right. It's all right.
 Come along, sister.
 Give us a moment.
 Sam?
 I'm sorry I wasn't there to help.
 There was nothing anyone could do.
 That was the hardest part.
 He asked for you in the end.
 What did you tell him?
 That you had gone to fetch Mother Caris
and would be back soon.
 He said he would... He would try to wait.
 I'm so sorry.
 I'm so sorry.
 Why isn't anyone ploughing these fields?
 There are too many peasants who've died.
 We will all be starving by winter
if someone doesn't plant something soon.
 What kind of lord
allows his lands to lie fallow?
 That's not up to a lord.
That's up to the Prior of Kingsbridge.
 These lands belong to the Priory.
They're yours.
 Right.
 And where on earth
am I going to find workers?
 Offer an incentive.
 That would make
the neighbouring lords furious.
 You seriously advocate
going against custom?
 But these are uncustomary times,
aren't they?
 If the people are to survive the winter,
 some things must change.
 Greetings, friends.
 As acting Prior,
I'm not sanctioned to say Mass,
 but I can speak to you from my heart.
 In the name of the father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.
 Why has God seen fit to punish us?
 Because of our sins?
 Then why take children?
 And if He must take them,
why take them in a way so terrible?
 God's purpose, it's always hidden,
it's only now beginning to reveal itself.
 This is the end of the old world.
 And it may be the beginning of a new one.
 And so
 as Prior of Kingsbridge,
and with the agreement of Brother Thomas,
 I have decided to offer an honest wage
 to anyone who will farm
our newly fallow lands.
 -Mother Caris.
-Gwenda!
 What brings you here?
 Wulfric and I
 want to be wed.
 Congratulations!
 That's wonderful!
 And we'd like you to marry us,
if that's allowed?
 Well, I'd be delighted.
 And will you give us land to farm,
like you promised?
 It's Priory land, Gwenda.
 You work for Lord Ralph.
 You do realise that it's against the law
to leave him without his permission?
 You said it's the beginning of a new world.
 Doesn't that mean laws will be broken?
 Yes. Yes, it does.
 Will you, Wulfric,
 take Gwenda as your lawful wife,
 to love and honour from this day forward?
 I will.
 Will you, Gwenda, take Wulfric
as your lawful husband,
 to love, honour and obey
from this day forward?
 Forget the bit about "obey."
 Never mind about "obey."
 I will.
 You put it on the notch.
 When they're on the notch, yeah? Listen.
 What's taking them so long?
 -Where are they?
-I don't know.
 No. Come on, Sam. Concentrate.
 Where's the notch?
 Ma, where are we going?
 Hush, I'll tell you later.
 Please! Tell me, I wanna know.
 Now Sam, we're leaving Wigleigh
to work on Prior Caris' fields.
 Who goes there?
 Yes, Sister?
 Mother Caris of Kingsbridge. I was sent for.
 Earl Roland?
 You.
 I've come to bring you comfort.
 You are a witch!
 Keep her away from me!
 Distribute these.
 Everyone in Shiring Castle
must wear a mask.
 Doni listen to her!
 -Don't listen to her.
-Lie quiet, My Lord.
 Don't listen to her.
 Don't listen to her.
 Matthias?
 Here, drink.
 Is it poison?
 Poison? That would be what you deserve.
 But no, I'm a better mother
than you are a son. Drink.
 There you are. Where have you been?
 I've been sitting by his side all night
with no sign of you.
 I was called to Shiring Castle. How is he?
 The world isn't through with him yet.
 What took you to Shiring?
 Earl Roland died of the Mortality
early this morning.
 Why the long face?
 He killed your father and took his title.
 And now your path lies open.
 This is a day for rejoicing.
 What business is this of yours?
 That shouldn't concern you.
 Know only that you should have been Earl,
 and now's your chance to win your title back,
 and more.
 What? Just like that?
 Oh, no.
 There's a game to be played.
 When you are ready to learn,
I'll be at your service.
 What do you mean "and more"?
 Lady Philippa?
 You'll make a lovely couple.
 I won't hide my face from you any more.
 At least I have the courage to do that.
 Your courage is misplaced, Tom.
 But it is a treat to see your dear face.
 And yours.
 I'm glad that my last vision is of you.
 Of everyone I have ever loved,
 I've loved no one half as much as you.
 "Very pleasant have you been to me,
 "and your love wonderful,
 "surpassing the love of women."
 Come closer.
 Be brave.
 Don't let your secrets die with you.
 Your Majesty.
 -Your Highness.
-Your Highness.
 What are you doing here?
 I've come to mourn my granddaughter.
 You are not welcome.
 I don't care if I'm welcome or not.
 She meant more to me
than any of my other grandchildren.
 I leave again in three days' time.
 Now grant me a moment alone with her,
if you please.
 Two days.
 I'm so sorry.
 I know how much you loved him.
 God forgive anyone
who misjudges you for that.
 Thank you.
 I've run away from too many things.
 And he loved me in spite of that.
 What do you mean?
 The past.
 The truth.
 What truth?
 Mine.
 When I was at Berkeley Castle
where King Edward II was imprisoned,
 two men arrived
with an order to execute the King.
 I killed the knight
who was to carry out this order.
 Murdered him in cold blood.
 You want to know why
Queen Isabella hates Kingsbridge?
 It's because I'm here.
 And I hold her secret.
 It was she who ordered the King's execution.
 And the King?
 Spirited out of the castle
and given a new life.
 He lives?
 Rumour has it he fled to Italy.
 I've been expecting you.
 Please come in.
 Sit.
 Why do you want to help me?
 You were born to be Earl. Don't you agree?
 Yes.
 Then I shall do all I can to make it happen.
 Why? Why do you care what happens to me?
 It's only natural for
a mother to care about her son.
 What are you talking about?
 I had a child out of wedlock.
 Sir Gerald and Lady Maud
raised him as their own.
 It was you.
 You're not my mother.
 Yes.
 No. No, no, no. My...
 My father was Sir Gerald.
 Your father, God damn his soul,
 was Earl Roland.
 No.
 You lie!
 I am the son of Lady Maud and Sir Gerald,
 defender of the realm
and the late Earl of Shiring!
 You're mine.
 You're mine.
 You're mine.
 Move!
 Did you know?
 -What?
-Did you know?
 I think more clearly
without a sword at my throat.
 What is it, brother?
 I'm not your brother. Did you know that?
 Yes.
 Mother told Caris before she died.
 Why didn't you tell me?
 Why would I want to hurt you, Ralph?
 -You're still my brother.
-No.
 I'm the rightful Earl of Shiring.
 You're nothing to me.
 I'm so sorry, Merthin.
 I was a fool to return to Kingsbridge.
What did I imagine?
 That everything would get better?
 I mean, nothing's ever different.
It just gets worse.
 And what about me?
 Your Priory comes before me.
 Well, without the Priory I'd be dead.
You know that.
 It was never a choice I made over you...
 Nevertheless it comes between us,
doesn't it?
 So you tell me, why should I stay?
 Because I love you.
 I love you.
 You realise this changes everything.
 Yes.
 I know.
 Your carriage is ready. Why aren't you in it?
 Your tears don't move me, Mother.
 I'm in a great deal of pain.
 I have malignancies that do not heal.
 In your body or your soul?
 Be cruel while you can,
 for you won't have me much longer.
 My physician tells me
I won't see another Christmastide.
 I'm sorry for you.
 I am, too.
 Surprised more.
 I thought I'd live forever.
 In reviewing my life, I admit
there's not much I've given this world.
 But the one thing
I'm proud of leaving behind is you.
 I didn't mean for you to see me like this.
 You're a better king than your father.
Which isn't saying much.
 But you're also a greater leader
of your people than any king before you.
 And l like to think
l had some little hand in making you so.
 Mother, wait.
 I'll have my own physicians care for you.
 Thank you.
 My Lord!
 My Lord,
a dozen of your peasants have deserted.
 What are you talking about?
 They've gone to work Priory land.
 Well, they can't do that!
When did they leave?
 Several nights past.
 Wulfric and his whore were the first to go
and the others followed after.
 Come with me.
 Prepare the gallows!
 You're breaking the law!
 According to the Ordinance of Labourers,
 no one is allowed to forsake their own village
and move to another!
 That's a law to prevent
the spread of the plague. It doesn't affect us!
 It's a law enforced to stop peasants
from leaving their masters.
 I need you to work my land.
 You will return to Wigleigh at once!
 We're being paid to work this land.
 And what do you pay?
 We'll no longer work for food alone.
 There ain't enough workers still alive.
 So if you want us, we want silver.
 Who is paying you?
 Prior Caris of Kingsbridge.
 -Prior Caris?
-Yes.
 Hello.
 -What's your name?
-Sam.
 Sam?
 Is that your Ma?
 Yes.
 He's a handsome lad, Gwenda.
 No!
 This, this is what I pay
unless you return to Wigleigh.
 One step closer and there will be blood.
 I've killed boys younger than him in France.
 All right.
 Acknowledge me as your lord.
 Whatever you say.
 Good.
 Kneel.
 Kneel.
 Kiss my foot.
 Bind him.
 No! Please!
 Please. Have mercy on him!
 I don't intend to deprive your son of a father,
if that's what you're worried about.
 But I do intend to
make an example of your man.
 As for the rest of you,
 if you return to Wigleigh by tomorrow
evening you will be pardoned.
 If not, you will be hanged.
 Do I make myself clear?
 Good.
 Take the boy.
 Run, Sam! Run!
 -Good boy.
-Go on, lad.
 If you want to see your man again,
bring the boy to the Manor House by Sunday.
 Good day, Brother Godwyn.
 Hot potage, freshly made.
 Can I get you anything else?
 Yes, Caris. Of course you can, Caris.
 I'm not Prior Caris.
 Prior Caris?
 Yes.
 Don't! Stop it!
 No! No! No!
 No!
 No! No!
 -Put him down.
-No!
 I am God's servant on this earth! Not you!
 You are a whore!
 I own Kingsbridge! Not you.
 You're a whore, Satan's whore, a witch!
 I'm going to burn you as a witch!
 I'm going to burn you! Whore!
 No!
 It's all my fault.
 Wulfric's going to hang because of me.
 No, he's going to hang because of Ralph.
 So what am I supposed to do?
Stand there and watch?
 Well, I'll tell you one thing.
I won't let him die.
 You watch me. I won't.
 I've called you from working my fields
 to give an example of what happens
to those who desert me.
 This man defied the Ordinance of Labourers.
 He chose to abandon his duty to me
to seek a life elsewhere.
 I gave his whore until last night
to present her son as ransom.
 You deserve to hang today...
 Is there anyone else who wishes to defy me?
 I do.
 Where's the boy?
 You will never see him. He's safe from you.
 Then why did you come?
 To beg for his life.
 You know my answer.
 Not beg you.
 Beg them.
 You know Wulfric.
You know he is a good man.
 He hasn't done anything to deserve this!
 You all know this is wrong!
 If Lord Ralph can do this to Wulfric,
 then he can hang any of us as he pleases!
 Is that right? Is that the rule of law?
 This ruffian is no better than a brigand.
 No. You are the brigand,
 robbing us of our land, working us like dogs,
 and hanging anyone who stands up to you!
 He even raped Annet and got away with it!
 Quiet, woman!
 We don't have to live like this!
 Shut her up.
 We don't!
 -Gwenda!
-Stop.
 Gwenda! Are you all right?
 Get back.
 -Get back.
-Hey.
 Get back.
 We're under attack, My Lord.
 -Don't let him get away.
-Stop him.
 Now we're in for it.
 Has my son returned?
 I know it must be hard...
 Is Merthin my brother?
 You share no bloodline.
 And I'm Roland's son?
 Yes.
 How do I know
you're not spinning a web of lies?
 You wouldn't be here
 if you didn't feel the truth of all I've said.
 What do you hope to profit from this?
 Profit?
 I hope to regain my son and see him prosper.
 Tell me you haven't always felt it.
 That you were born for greatness.
 Well, try telling my peasants that.
 Your peasants?
 They defied me.
 They've risen up like rabid dogs.
 I'll hire two score soldiers and kill them all.
 I'll burn Wigleigh to the ground.
 That would certainly
teach them a lesson. But...
 But what?
 In chaos, anything is possible.
 The true heir of Earl Roland would
turn this revolt to his advantage.
 Did I hear you correctly, Lord Ralph?
 Your peasants defied you?
 Not just me, Your Majesty.
 They are a growing band
rising up against all authority,
 including the crown.
 What?
 Find them and hang them!
 That's my fervent wish.
 But these outlaws, they...
 They hail from Wigleigh.
 The same county as Shiring.
 They can be tried and punished
only by the Earl.
 But he died in the late Mortality, so...
 I see.
 And if you are made Earl,
 you will deliver these outlaws to justice.
 Is that your promise?
 Yes, Your Majesty.
 And will you look after Kingsbridge
better than Roland did?
 Happily, My Queen.
 He will also take care of the Priory,
Your Majesty.
 How dare you speak without permission!
 Who is this woman?
 She's my mother, Your Majesty.
 Remember your place.
 What is the problem with the Priory?
 A woman Prior, who gave the peasants land
to lure them from their lords.
 Who gave her this right?
 The Bishop of Kingsbridge,
recently deceased.
 A new one is desperately needed
to restore order.
 Is there someone in line to replace him?
 Oh, yes.
 The previous Prior was ill
but has regained his health.
 Morning!
 What's the meaning of this?
 How dare you enter without my permission?
 Please, forgive me, My Lady.
 But I am lord of this castle now.
 What's this?
 An order from the King
naming me Earl of Shiring.
 How wonderful to be Earl of Shiring
and all that goes with it.
 My most precious privilege, of course,
 is I get to marry whomever I please.
 And here I am
 with two beautiful choices.
 So hard to choose.
 She's just a child!
 Not for long.
 You can't do this! Let her go!
 Who do you think you're talking to?
 You have no power over her.
 But I do.
 There is, however, one obvious alternative.
 As your Bishop,
 I declare
 we are gathered here in the eyes of God
as witnesses to this holy union.
 And so I ask,
 do you, Ralph, Lord of Wigleigh,
Earl of Shiring
 take Philippa of Shiring
to be your lawful wife?
 I do.
 Do yoU, Philippa,
 take Ralph of Shiring, Lord of Wigleigh
to be your lawful husband,
 to honour and obey
 so long as you shall live?
 I do.
 You may kiss the bride.
 Your Lord awaits you, Philippa.
 I know you married me against your will.
 I promise I will give you such happiness.
 Look at you.
 So beautiful. So peaceful.
 I've dreamt of this night.
 Kept me warm in France.
 You gave me strength in battle.
 The very thought of you kept me alive.
 I sent her away.
 Who?
 Odila.
 You can't have her.
 I don't want Odila.
 I only wanted you.
 You'll never have me.
 Philippa!
 Philippa! Look at me!
 Look at me!
