 World Without End (2012): Season 1, Episode 2 - Medieval Life and Death: Part 2 - full transcript 
 Elfric and Caris are married, though their marriage is far from a happy one. While she tries to be a dutiful wife, Caris does not love him. She even tries to get work for her husband's ...

 Amen.
 Amen.
 Will you, Elfric Builder,
 take Caris Wooler as your lawful wife?
 I will.
 Will you, Caris Wooler,
 take Elfric Builder as your lawful husband,
 to love, honour,
 and obey from this day forward,
so long as you live?
 I will.
 You may kiss the bride.
 Smile.
 Sir Roland.
 I will, Your Highness.
 Majesty,
 I bring good news from Kingsbridge.
 Two more traitors arrested and hung.
 Any monks among them?
 No.
 Shame.
 In short,
Kingsbridge has been purged once again.
 So Kingsbridge is now
a shining example of my realm?
 Well, there is always
room for improvement, Majesty.
 Did you have anything in particular in mind?
 Many things.
 But let's start with taxes.
 Kingsbridge wool is renowned
throughout the world.
 Shouldn't that be a good source of revenue?
 Actual more, Majesty, I think you will find
they are already quite heavily taxed.
 Are you suggesting they can't provide more?
 No, Majesty.
 If more is required,
then more will be provided.
 Then we require more, much more.
 A war is coming, and wars are expensive. Go.
 And tax those monks, too!
 A witch is to be tried on Saturday morning!
The last day of the fair!
 "The end approacheth," sayeth the Lord.
"Death to sinners, and hellfire eternal."
 What's Sir Roland doing here?
 And with his sons no less?
He never deigns to come to the fair.
 I expect they've come to meet his fiancée.
 His what?
 Lady Margery. Didn't you know?
 Sixteen's a bit old for a first marriage, Father.
She must be hideous.
 Au contraire,
You've met her, haven't you, Richard?
 Well, Father,
I've confessed Lady Margery several times.
 But to be honest,
I wasn't focused on her charm.
 Are you going to be able to
keep up with her?
 No fear for me in the bedroom, boy.
 Philippa's met her, says she's spoiled.
 Yes. There goes your inheritance, boys.
 Is it true your master's to be married?
 What's it to you?
 Why so cruel?
 I only ask out of genuine curiosity.
 I once knew him well.
 You and many other women.
 Have you met the bride-to-be?
 She's young and she's pretty,
if that's what you're asking.
 Now if you don't mind, I have
better things to do than to banter with you.
 Of course.
 Elfric?
 He's out.
 Do you have any idea
where I might find him?
 He tells me very little.
 Did you make these?
 Yes.
 I model Elfric's projects in miniature
to work out any problems.
 You're very talented.
 Thank you.
 Still, I see things in my mind
that I want to build,
 but I don't know where to start.
 I was a student of architecture myself.
 Always wanted to study in Florence.
 You've been to Italy?
 I never completely understood
how the structures were supported.
 I'm sure you could
follow the drawings better than I.
 I doubt it.
 Don't doubt your abilities, Merthin.
 Very important.
 -There you go.
-Get me some sage, love.
 Signor Caroli? Leaving already?
 Buongiorno, Caris, Mattie.
 Why are you empty-handed?
 Your aunt has raised prices again.
 If I can't afford them,
then neither can anyone else.
 I'd like to go home with something
from the best fleece fair in the country,
 since it took me nearly a lifetime
to get across that bridge.
 I'm so sorry. I'll talk to Father.
 I'll think twice before returning.
 Why don't they widen the bridge?
 -I think father is debating it as we speak.
-What's to debate?
 Hire a builder.
 Merthin. Come with me.
 Hold on.
 No, no, I need you to come with me.
Come on!
 -What?
-I'll explain on the way.
 For the Priory!
 Bless you, sir.
 This fair brings in more money in one week
than we make all year.
 If we don't widen the bridge,
our merchants will go elsewhere.
 That is of no concern to me.
 Well, it should be.
 Why? The money is for you, not the Priory.
 Fine. We'll pay for it.
 You can't afford to any more than we can.
 Elfric is the only builder we have,
and he'll charge a fortune.
 You'd complain more
if the bridge were closed.
 This is getting us nowhere.
Merthin, give us your opinion.
 I...
 He's just an apprentice.
 Let him speak.
 Well, I'd wait till late summer,
when the river is at its lowest.
 I wouldn't have to close it completely,
 but there would only be enough space
for a few people at a time.
 And I would most certainly
do it cheaper than Elfric.
 But even this man will want money.
 The Guild will pay.
 But who then will own it?
 Well, the Guild, of course!
 And what of our coffers?
 The Priory's income comes from this bridge.
That will never change.
 Stubborn fool!
 If you ask me,
it ought to be rebuilt altogether.
 Why do you say that?
 Just look at it.
 It was never built to carry this much traffic.
 I'd be surprised if it lasts another year.
 Thank you for thinking of me.
 I wanted to dress in this.
 Philippa, look at this! Do you like it?
 Perhaps Roland will give it to me
as a wedding gift.
 It's beautiful!
 Milady.
 I couldn't help but notice that the pale green
matches your eyes quite perfectly.
 How kind of you to say so.
 But my eyes are blue.
 Philippa. There you are.
 Spending my money again?
 And this must be Lady Margery.
 I'm William, Sir Roland's oldest son.
 And soon to be your stepson.
 Ladies, I've heard there is
a wonderful selection of furs just over here.
 -Shall we?
-Yes.
 Hey, Da! Look at this!
 Stop it, son!
That's our livelihood you are playing with!
 Annet, catch!
 Wulfric! You're terrible!
 Fresh eggs. Eggs, sir?
 No, thank you.
 Fresh eggs!
 Hey, you're Ralph Fitzgerald, aren't you?
 What of it?
 I remember you when I was little.
 You were the handsomest lad in 20 miles.
 All the girls were in love with you then.
 And now?
 They still are. Some of them.
 What's your name?
 Annet.
 My father is Perkin of Wigleigh.
This is his stall.
 You're quite handsome yourself, Annet.
 Are these your eggs?
 My hens'.
 Serviced by a healthy cock, I hope.
 Would you like to go walking, Annet?
 My fiancé will be jealous.
 Your fiancé?
 He's a bit of a lump, isn't he?
 See to your customers, boy.
I'm well taken care of.
 He needn't worry.
 I only wish to see your hens.
 And I'll show you a great crowing rooster.
 You leave my girl alone!
 You fuck off! Fuck off.
 Out of my way!
 All right, my lad.
 -You are coming with me.
-Get off!
 And you are in big fucking trouble now!
 More Burgundy.
 Enjoy it while you can.
 For soon, there will be none.
The French have blockaded all your ports.
 I wait only for new ships, and then, trust me,
I will clear them from our coast.
 But I am not going to invade France.
 With this provocation, your father
would have declared war immediately.
 I find it curious how, in death,
 my father has become
the very paragon of kingliness.
 We have a right to that throne.
 No. You think you have a right.
I have no interest in France.
 And your claim only brings us trouble.
 And you conveniently forget
one salient point.
 I alone am King.
 You are not my co-regent.
 You are merely my mother.
 Tastes like shit.
 -I'm sorry.
-"I'm sorry."
 Have you tasted it?
 Yes.
 Did you like it?
 I hoped it was satisfactory.
 ''Satisfactory''?
 I break my back all day,
and you feed me "satisfactory"?
 Don't worry, I'll get you something else.
 Worthless.
 "Elfric, you married
the most beautiful woman in Kingsbridge.
 "She'll bear you many sons."
 Barren bitch.
 Look at me.
 Look at me!
 -No! No!
-Come here!
 One day he's going to kill you.
 If I could just give him a child.
 Then he'll beat the both of you.
 Do you even really want children, Caris?
 I didn't even want marriage.
 It's easy knowing what you don't want.
 But what is it you do want?
 Come on. And that side. Go on!
 Thank you very much. That's lovely.
That's great. Thank you.
 What did he do?
 A fight with the Earl's squire.
He broke the squire's nose.
 Over what?
 Some girl.
 The squire was trying to
have his way with her.
 Was she as pretty as you?
 Who?
 That girl you defended.
 Fuck off, you little Scheissdreck!
 What's your name?
 Wulfric.
 Wulfric of Wigleigh?
 I've heard of you.
 Well, I've heard of you.
 You're Gwenda the Saxon, ain't you?
 That's right.
 Let him out. He's paid enough for his crime.
 Why should you care?
 He stands up for girls.
 Look who it is, the master craftsman.
What the fuck are you doing?
 Building the new cruck frame
that you asked for.
 All day to build a cruck frame?
 It's all but finished.
 "All but, all but."
 What the fuck is this?
 It's a more efficient design.
 It's a toy.
 You piss me off, boy.
 You'll never make the Guild,
 not if I have anything to do with it.
You understand?
 If you say so.
 Well, I do say so.
 Merthin.
 And where the hell have you been?
 -Mattie's.
-Don't lie to me.
 You were off trying to give all my jobs to him.
 Yeah, that's right.
 Godwyn told me.
 You took Merthin down to the bridge
for an appraisal.
 -She was just trying to help me...
-I wasn't talking to you.
 You dare steal work from me?
 You worthless bitch!
 No, no, no, no!
 You'll be hanged.
 No!
 You touch her again,
and I'll split your skull like firewood.
 Your apprenticeship is done.
 And you, you're no wife to me.
 Now get out from under my roof,
the both of you!
 Come on!
 -Where will you go?
-I don't know.
 What about you? What will you do?
 There's always work to be had.
 Not as a builder.
He'll stop you from joining the Guild.
 So I'll do something else. I'll do anything.
 You could apprentice in another town.
 I don't want to leave.
 But you're good at it.
You're clearly good at it.
 Don't you know I care for you.
 Don't, Merthin, I can't. I'm not free.
 Could you love me?
 I think I could.
 Then why don't we run away together?
 It's a step too far, too soon.
 I just need some time.
 Please?
 Excuse me, Brother.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
 Do you letter, Brother Matthias?
 I write, but I don't know anything near as...
 There are rules of silence here,
Brother Matthias.
 And you as a novice
should know that by now.
 Forgive me, Brother Godwyn...
 Thank you.
 Like this. Here.
 Practice makes perfect.
 The Priory must return to the old ways,
Mother. No women allowed.
 Celibacy should be enforced.
 Even the great Prior Philip
recognised women's inferiority
 and Satan's presence within them.
 If we're so inferior,
why would Satan act through us?
 No. Spiritually inferior.
 Which is why his witches are always female.
 It has nothing to do with
women's sexual power over men?
 Don't be absurd.
 You no longer masturbate?
 Mother!
 You were so infatuated
with your cousin Caris.
 Always wanting to bathe with her.
 She never interested me.
 I'm glad to hear it. She's asleep upstairs.
 Caris?
 Elfric has thrown her out
and she's recovering here.
 Poor Godwyn.
 You seem unable to avoid females
in the Priory or the home.
 Still, once you're Prior...
 For God's sake, Mother, I'll never be Prior!
 By the time Uncle Anthony dies,
I'll be ancient.
 Be patient. You'll be Prior soon enough.
 All doors yield to time.
 A secret well known to us inferior women.
 No! No! Papa!
 Shut up! It's only a fuck.
 Stay away.
 You'll pay for this!
 Amulets! Cook pots and more!
Pegs and hooks! Buttons and buckles!
 Scarecrows and used bodkins!
 Hey, Gwenda. I've been looking for you.
 Well, I haven't been looking for you,
so get lost.
 I want you to meet someone.
Your new husband.
 -I don't think so.
-Too bad.
 You're bought and paid for.
He gave me this cow.
 What? You can't trade me for a cow.
 -Come along.
-Hey! No! No!
 I'm not going anywhere!
 -What is going on?
-Let me by.
 Not so fast!
 She is going to be my wife.
 -Now you let me pass.
-What?
 You can't trade a woman for a cow.
 Why not?
That's my cow, and this is his daughter.
 -It's slavery!
-Tie her up!
 What's going on? Stop this!
Stop this at once! Stop it now!
 Now will someone tell me
what's happening here?
 He wants to sell his daughter for a cow.
 She is mine to do with as I please.
 -It's against the law!
-Enough!
 It's not against the law,
the Bible sanctions it.
 Exodus, chapter 21 .
 See, a man can do what he wants
with his children.
 Is there anyone here who disagrees?
 Not if he treats his children like you do.
 How many of you
were made to steal at the age of seven?
 Or fucked
when your father had too much to drink?
 She's a liar!
 -I'm not!
-Silence!
 The Priory has jurisdiction
over all bargains agreed at the Fleece Fair!
 As Sacrist I have the authority to decide,
and you must all agree with my decision,
 or burn in hell for prideful disobedience!
 Please.
 -Take her away.
-No!
 -No! Please! Help me!
-Come along. Come along.
 -You heard what the holy man said.
-No! No!
 Get off me!
 You call yourself a man of God?
 I doubt the devil's even proud of you.
 -Help me! Please!
-Come on, girl.
 -It's all right, girl.
-Please help me! No!
 Do we know who the witch is yet?
 No.
 Give these my lucky shake.
 See what happens.
 You won't beat that.
 -I'll tell you what.
-What?
 I'll bet you a gold coin for that woman.
 Go on, Sim. You never lose.
 You never win.
 Go on, then. You won't win.
 -She's mine.
-No. It's only fair that I have first dibs.
 I won her fair and square, mate. More or less.
 I think I'll collect my winnings now.
 Please, let me go. I won't tell.
 And if you're caught,
I'll stand witness to your mercy. Please!
 How about gentle!
 Here, take this off. I'll do it myself.
 That's a good girl.
 Gwenda?
 Where is she?
 Quiet, quiet, quiet, please!
Silence for Bishop Richard.
 May God bless these proceedings,
and may justice prevail.
 -Amen.
-Amen.
 Before the witch trial begins,
 Earl Roland has an announcement to read
from the Queen.
 By order of the Exchequer of Receipt,
 whose purpose is to fund future wars,
 a tax on wool
will be imposed throughout the land,
 and all foodstuffs will be sold to royal troops
at fair prices below market value.
 In addition,
 there will be an increase in the yearly tax
paid by the Kingsbridge community
 and its Priory to one-tenth of its income
and property value.
 Your complaints are treasonous!
 Her Majesty Queen Isabella has appointed me
as tax collector in Kingsbridge.
 So you will shut up and listen!
 Quiet! Listen to me!
Have any of you ever been to Melcombe?
 Ships block the harbour! French ships!
 Stopping your goods
from leaving the country!
 This Fleece Fair would be
twice as successful if those ships were gone.
 We could pay the taxes
and still make a fine profit.
 This tax is not petty or wicked.
 It's a means for England to fight France!
 And the very soul of England is Kingsbridge!
 Let us show the King
the true meaning of Kingsbridge loyalty!
 We will sacrifice! All for England!
Come on! All for England!
 For England!
 What sheep.
 But what a brilliant shepherd.
 Gwenda!
 Gwenda, you are my wife!
 Bring in the witch.
 Mattie!
 Behold, the witch known as Mattie Wise.
 The chief witness against her
is Brother Joseph, Priory physician.
 What?
 This woman works with the devil
to prey on the sick.
 She uses Moorish texts, unknown herbs.
She's half-Moor herself.
 A Muslim infidel!
 She cures people.
She cured my infant son of an awful fever.
 A cure from the devil is no cure at all.
 Her patients sicken and die.
 More of yours die! She provides cures.
 Don't listen to her.
She's the witch's assistant.
 Let her be heard.
 -She left her husband to live with the devil!
-Silence!
 This is a trial.
A defence may be presented. Proceed.
 Yes, some of her patients sicken
in spite of her help,
 but look at those that she's cured.
 My own mother was helped by her for years.
 Until she died.
 It wasn't Mattie that killed her.
 Mattie has been with us for years.
 She has set your bones
and birthed your children.
 And now because the Priory wants to
increase fleece fair revenue,
 she becomes your entertainment.
 She is innocent of this charge,
and you all know it.
 There is no proof that she is a witch.
 There is one proof that cannot be denied.
 I, as a mendicant friar,
have hunted witches for years
 and know the mark of Satan well.
 All witches have a third nipple
especially reserved to suckle Satan.
 Allow me to examine her.
 Proceed, Friar Murdo.
 No!
 There!
 Hang the witch!
 That's no proof!
 I need no further proof. Hang her!
 No! Mattie!
 Mattie!
 No! No!
 My work is done. Best we leave while we can.
 Mattie! Mattie!
 Gwenda!
 Come here!
 No.
 Oh, God.
 Oh, my God!
 My God!
 I can't swim.
 Help me, please!
 No!
 Somebody save him!
 Save him!
 Save Sir Roland!
 Here, take my hand!
 Pull! Get up!
 I've got you. Come on.
 Help me!
 Thank God, sister. Thank God.
The angels were watching over me.
 My brother! My dear brother!
 God save his innocent soul, he's drowned!
 My brother! Help! Help!
 My brother's dead! My brother's drowned.
Help me!
 Take him out! Take him out! My brother!
 Mattie! Mattie! No! No!
 I've got you, I've got you, I've got you!
 No, no, no!
