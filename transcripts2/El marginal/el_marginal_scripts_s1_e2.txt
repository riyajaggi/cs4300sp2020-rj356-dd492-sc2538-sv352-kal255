 A Netflix Original Series (LUNA SCREAMING) Hi, Dad. I'm fine. They're saying that you kept some money. If you give it back, they'll set me free. Help me. (CELL PHONE RINGING) JAMES: Now you know that your daughter is fine. But only for now. I swear, if you so much as touch a hair on her head...

 Your daughter's virginity is in your hands. It's 3 million. Where am I supposed to get that money? From wherever you hid it, you son of a bitch. That money isn't yours. One more thing, in addition to the money, we want you to release Sosa. Who is Sosa? One of our colleagues, he was hurt. I have no idea where he is. He escaped. You don't know where he is? Bullshit. Fuck. They think the bastard is alive. (GUN FIRING ON TV) This shit isn't downloading. (SNORTING)

 Enough drinks. Eat something. I want to download this picture from WhatsApp, but I can't. Take a look, you know about these things. Dios! Come on. Stop busting my balls, Marito. Work hours are over. I'm not talking as your boss, but as your brother. Don't talk to me like that or else I'll knock out your drug-addict teeth. Drug addicts always have rotten teeth. It's part of the obsession, because they like to show them off. When they're clean, they're embarrassed, so they laugh with their mouths closed. Suck my balls. Yeah, I'm going to have to suck your balls, because with that mouth, you won't be able to fuck anyone. Not even the crooks from the courtyard. Idiot. Why didn't you tell me you ordered pizza? I was eating the stew I've been giving to Luna. You're calling her by her name. (LAUGHING) He fell in love with the kid. I don't know, I've never had a cock in my mouth. I'm not sure you can say the same. (ALL LAUGHING) DIOS: I didn't say anything, Barny. (GUN FIRING ON TV) Enough playing around. I'm worried about the girl. She's acting crazy. She's being strange, saying that she hears noises. Is the radio still on loud? Yes, but it's still strange because there isn't anyone around there. Did they put someone in the bunkers? You can hear everything there. MORCILLA: Excuse me. DIOS: Morcilla. MORCILLA: Do you have mine? Take this one. Morcilla, did you put anyone in the bunkers? Yeah, that new guy. We put him there with Capece without anyone knowing. You said you didn't want any more deaths. I listened to you. Capece is an idiot. Tell him to come here. No, he left already. Then stick the pizza up your ass and go. I already ate. Tell Capece to move the new guy early tomorrow. It's dangerous having people there. Capece. (INDISTINCT TALKING ON RADIO) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (DOOR OPENS) CAPECE: Did you have a good time, Pena? I could keep you there a week, 20 days, and nobody would know. At least don't bust my balls. Take a shower and make yourself presentable. I don't want the social worker to see you like this. Look, the bunker doesn't exist anymore. Do you understand? Capece, it's illegal to put inmates in the bunker. Report him to that security guard. I'll be your witness. What can you testify? You're out touring all day. DIOS: I don't know who let him into prison. They say he enters Miss Capece's ass. (TATTOO MACHINE WHIRRING) PASTOR: How do I get a calling card? Hi. How are you? Good day. How was your solitude? Good? I'm happy. Luckily, everything is the same here, a beautiful day to be in prison. Good day. I have to talk to my lawyer. No. Wait. Don't report that they put you in solitary confinement. They'll kill you and your lawyer. PASTOR: No, that's not why. Okay, I don't know. The only one that has them is Morcilla, but I don't think he'll give you one. If he does, it'll be expensive. PASTOR: Get me one and I'll owe you two. No, don't pull me into this mess. I'll have to answer to that fat troll. I already paid for my right to be here. Did Morcilla fuck you? No, he beat the shit out of me and I was his bitch for a year. You don't know how many times I dreamed of gutting him and cooking him on the grill in the middle of the courtyard. And when I was about to eat him, it would be 300 kilos of rotten flesh, a smell that would stink up the whole prison. And Antin let us all leave, but nobody would go. All the prisoners were outside, circling the prison. Paint me that picture. What? That's it. A view of the prison from above, with the prisoners circling it. Right, my friend? Do you know where the Sub-21 are? Cesar and his drug addicts? INMATE: A tall name for a gang. Cesar and his drug addicts. Sounds like Ricky Espinosa. Over there. I'll tell you about the dream another time, because you're starting to act like Gauchito Gil. We can't escape there. I don't fit. We have to find another way. This is impossible, even the midget won't fit. I don't fit. Look who it is. CESAR: Hey. ALL: ♪ The craziest guy from the block is back ♪ He came back mad ♪ He fucks Morcilla standing up ♪ And leaves the prick fucked up ♪ We don't want refugees here in the courtyard ♪ Sub-21, I'm a soldier ♪ (ALL CHEERING) (WHISTLES) Welcome, Pastor. You look good. Normally, you leave there cracked. Today is Cesar's birthday. Really? Happy birthday. We're all in. We're starting a rebellion. We're igniting the house and getting Morcilla. I need you to get me a calling card. I don't have anything to give you, they confiscated everything. You don't have to give us anything. If you help us, we'll help you. This is for my brother. Save a portion for me, I'll come back later. (MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) (TURNS DOWN VOLUME) (HANDCUFF CLICKING) Your food, baby. My name isn't baby. What's your name? Luna. Luna Lunati. Yes. I knew your dad was a son of a bitch, but to be bad to his own daughter... What about you? You're blonde, but you're black as shit. It's not nice to talk like that. Do you think I'm going to eat this garbage? I'd rather die, nigger. What did you say? Nigger. What is "nigger"? It means "black piece of shit" in English. Didn't your father teach you what human rights are? No. He was busy putting idiots like you behind bars. I think he was busy sticking his nose in other people's business. Maybe. Why is this radio on all the time? Because the "On-Off" is broken. Take out the batteries, fucking idiot. "My friend, do you have some change? "Come on, for some drugs." My father is going to kill you all. You don't know how horrible it is to be locked in a shitty place like this. No. I can't imagine. (TURNS UP VOLUME) If you put one finger on the radio, I'll cut it off. (KNOCK ON DOOR) (DOOR CLOSES) Amaya. Here. Let her eat and then cuff her again. Is Capece coming? I don't know. Why? No reason. I'll talk to him later. What's wrong? You don't trust me? We trust you. They said he went out. Just for a few hours. Do you think my brother would make you do something that would jeopardize you? Okay, fine. But you can't tell anyone. I'd like for us to talk a little and for you to tell me about yourself and your interests so that I know how I can help you. You want me to tell you about myself? Mmm-hmm. Honestly, I prefer the women to talk and for me to listen. At least on the first date. This isn't a date. This is an interview between an inmate and a social worker. Do you have a profession? No. I read that you didn't finish high school. Would you like to finish it? No. Why not? There are a lot of inmates that take advantage of this program. They're very satisfied, some even decide to pursue a degree. Maybe, but that's not my case. Okay, let's talk about your time here. I saw that you were in the courtyard and that you were adapting well. The next step is to move on to a cell block. I'm not sure if you've seen the different cell blocks. If there is a group that you feel an affinity with. I'm not interested in any groups. Fine. From what I can see, you're not interested in anything. I'll complete some questions so we can finish the interview. You know, some inmates take advantage of this time in their lives to change, grow or reflect. To become better people. You honestly think that a man can save himself here? Yes, of course. You don't? Here a thief becomes more of a thief and a murderer more of a murderer. Do you think that with a theater workshop you're going to change the garbage here? We obviously don't think the same. Either way, you're right. We can't help everyone. Some people are not worth the time. I'll see you next Thursday, same time. I'm sorry I have to bug you again, but I have to. You can go. Morci, treat us to something? It's Cesar's birthday. "Morci"? That's "Mr. Morcilla," you assholes. There are no birthdays here. Months and weeks don't exist. The whole year is the same fucking day, over and over again. The sun rises and then it's night. That's it. Get out of here. (BOTTLES CLINKING) Here. Make them last. Three beers? That's it? They're warm on top of it all. Come on, don't be a rat. Give us something more. Use your imagination. Here a rotten potato can turn into a bird. A clean black ass can turn into a beautiful blonde pussy. Shut up, you're fat. Don't pretend to be a ladies' man. When I came here, I was thinner than you. But I ate so many niggers, and now I look like this. And I'm still hungry. Come on, give us a few beers more, and a card. It's Cesar's birthday. Do I look like a charity? Come on, a card. Come on. I don't set the prices. A card lasts an hour. If you give 10 minutes of ass, that could get you 60 minutes of business. We'll give you 60 kicks in the ass. Get out of here. Get out of here. Ugly fag. Eat shit. They all say the same thing, but the same thing happens. Our cell block has the last turn at the cafeteria. Do you want to know what we eat? Nothing. And if they do give us something, do you know what it is? Have you ever eaten the food here? How can I help you? I asked if you've ever eaten here. You know that I haven't. It's shit. It's even worse if they scratch the bottom of the pot to give us what's left. I'm putting the brakes on the mess here. I'm here to negotiate. Are you going to do anything? I'll escalate the issue to the director, let's see what he says. Take it to the director. Don't promise something you're not going to do. Do you know what a rebellion is? Yes, of course. Have you experienced it? Do you want anything else? Nothing else. Do you know what the gringos call a fake umbrella? What? Unbrella. (LAUGHING) You don't know English. "Umbrella" is for the rain. INMATE: Morcilla only gave us three beers. I'm sick of him. We need to get him. Calm down. Did you get the card? INMATE: No. Here. There's a little bit of credit left. Wait. I'll give it to you, but what will you give me? Come on. Don't be upset. You know what things cost around here. I'm not just giving him a card, I'm denying myself talking to my family. It's the only thing I have. Are these Fiorella's? If Morcilla sees me with these, he'll take them. He won't touch you. (PEDRO LAUGHS) Do you want them? (ALL LAUGHING) AUTOMATED VOICE: The cellular phone you are calling is either turned off or out of the area... How are you? Everything all right? Good? Good. You? Everything's good. WOMAN ON PHONE: Palacio Studios, good afternoon. PASTOR: I'd like to speak to Fernando Palacios. WOMAN ON PHONE: He's not here. Who's calling? Tell him his brother called. Tell him to call me. Is there a problem? No, everything's fine. DIOS: Those lawyers are ulcers, worse than rapists. But they wear a suit and tie. I'm sure he told you, "Don't say anything, deny everything," and he buried you. Right? You know it. See? Here, lawyers won't save you. Neither will laws. Nothing. Here, loyalty saves you. Okay. You need to be grateful to me. Why? What do you mean, "why"? Why do you think they took you out of the bunker so quickly? Because of God? Thank you. Don't worry. I won't charge you. It's free. Unless I look like a lawyer? (CHUCKLES) Thank you. Hello. How are you? Are you cleaning your locker? I should do the same. Cleaning? I'm taking everything out. Now that I know anyone can come and inspect your things. That only happened once. It doesn't matter, it's enough. Doesn't it bother you that anyone can open your locker? I'm sorry, I had an interview with an awful new inmate. A show-off who thinks he's the only one locked up. It's filled with them. But if they're going to affect your mood... What are you going to do? All of a sudden, I look like the one with experience and you're new. No, but this guy was different. Was he cute? I don't know. I didn't look. Come on, it's just the two of us. I didn't look. I'm not interested. I'm not telling you to check him out, but you're telling me that in all this time, you've never liked anyone? Never! You shouldn't play with that, seriously. Do you want to fall in love with someone? Here's a photo of my cat. Mmm. (LAUGHS) LUCRECIA: There's a problem with the wife of one of the inmates who came for a visit. They can't find him. ANTIN: Who is the inmate? LUCRECIA: Gustavo Sosa. I want you to go tell her the director wants to speak with her. Bring her here and I'll explain. After that, I have to go run an errand. It won't be long, an hour and a half. Fine. An hour and a half. Fortunately, your husband is getting better. They ran a diagnostic. He's sick with a complicated case of gastroenteritis. We had to hydrate him through an IV. An IV? Yes. Is it bad? (TIRE SCREECHING) No, not anymore. He's past the tricky part. They just called from the hospital saying that they want to send him back. I told them to keep him for one more day. Which hospital is he in? Can I visit him? If we officially report that there is an inmate with gastroenteritis... Board meetings, checks, reports, bureaucracy... A mess! I want to compensate you, something small. I said, "What should I do with Mrs. Sosa? "Since she came all this way, I want her to have this money." Take them, as compensation. In the meantime, I promise that when your husband is back, I'll give him a card so that he can call you. Thank you. And this stays between us. You want cash? I can give you cash. For good work. I'm very much in love with you. LUCRECIA: You don't have to lie to me. I swear to God. You're very horny. This isn't love. It looks a little like love, but it's not love. It's pure love, Lucre. Don't be a skeptic. You're the love of my life. Okay. (MUSIC PLAYING) (MOANING) (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) LUCRECIA: Do you like it? (MARIO PANTING) Pastor. Pastor. Pastor. Pastor. (GASPS) Let's go. Where? To celebrate. What? Cesar's birthday. The girl. INMATE: Shut up, midget. (ALL LAUGHING) Do you want some? (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) Turn that off, you cunt. (GROANS) MORCILLA: How awful, Pedro. Do you want a drink, too? He's a child. Go, Morcilla, come on. What the fuck did you do? Stop, son of a bitch. What the fuck is wrong with you? (ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (MUSIC PLAYING) Bye, Morci. Now. You're scum. (WHISTLING) (ALL CHEERING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) ANTIN: How is it that six fucking idiots control your courtyard? My courtyard? Yes, yours. What about you? What? They never stole anything from me. It's Morcilla's fault. Everything fell apart under him. He's on his way out. What about your night watch? Talk about collaboration! Fags. Don't blame the guards, they get paid shit. Be thankful that they closed off the hallway to the cell blocks, because if they got to the fags' cell, it wouldn't stop. We'd be empanada filling, like in Sierra Chica. They stole 50 phone cards. Those sons of bitches. I'm going to spend the whole month watching those idiots from the courtyard talking on the phone for free. (GRUNTS) Listen. What do you know about Sosa? Did you talk to his wife? What do you know about him? Where is he? It's like I told you. Do you know anything or not? It's like I told you. What? He went home... Yes. One of his kids was sick, so he decided to stay a few more days. Tell me, Mario, did you talk to Sosa directly? Or did you speak to his wife? No, I called her at work because their house phone isn't working. Oh, okay. That's great. So you believe that he's going to come back and everything will be great? Everything's good. Sosa's a good father and he's being responsible at home with his kids. He's a good guy. Call me if you need anything. Obviously. (DOOR CLOSES) MORCILLA: Hurry up. What a disaster those assholes left. I'm going to make them shit fire. (BOTTLES CLINKING) Be careful. We've already lost enough. I'm going to talk to Mario. They'll get what's coming to them. What the fuck are you laughing at? Nothing. I'm sure you had something to do with this. Me? No. You did this to yourself. It wouldn't have hurt you to give them a few beers. At least not fuck them with the price. Don't come here, advising me how to run my business. Me advise you? No. I can see you have everything under control. Mario wants to talk to you. Tell him I'm coming. No, Morcilla. He's looking for him. WING 86 (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) Girl. Breakfast. Girl. Hey, girl! Girl! Fuck. Amaya. Come here. Amaya. What's wrong? She's dead. What do you mean, she's dead? Your problem is that you don't psychoanalyze people. I know you laugh because I go to a psychologist. But therapy teaches you how to see more. You can size people up right away. Look at Freud, here. All right, so who would you put in charge of controlling those assholes? Hi. What's your name? Pastor Pena. Did you see that we have a mess in the courtyard? Dios says that you could take care of it. If Dios says so. What my brother is trying to say is... We want you to take Morcilla's spot in the courtyard. We want you to be part of the gang and to take care of the business down there. What's with the face, my friend? Do you want to work with us or not? That's why I'm here. She has a pulse. You made me shit my pants. Go get Borges. Go get a doctor. We see that the guys respect you. It's not easy to get them to like you right away. Aside from watching our store, you can watch over those morons so they don't do shit like last night. That can't happen again. I recommend dishing out a few slaps when necessary, as a friend. Get in their heads. Okay. There's a problem with Luna. Sit down. Do you want to play PlayStation? Shit, she's not responding. What's wrong, angel? Are you sure you didn't hear anything strange last night? No, I was outside and I looked in once in a while. Give me the tray. Come on, respond, beauty. The doctor is coming. Borges, the doctor is taking too long. Okay, let me know and we'll go get him at the entrance to the workshop. Perfect. The doctor is on his way. Amaya is hysterical. I know, he's a pussy. Fix this, then get rid of him. Okay. Let me know when Toro gets here. Here we can do what we like. You can come here to watch soccer or whatever you want. We've got a porn channel. If not, ask Pancho. (LAUGHING) This is like... I'm not saying it's like being outside. It's not paradise, but almost. People pay a fortune, right? Yeah... To be somewhere like this, with a TV. With a PlayStation, foosball, Ping-Pong. Do you know how to play Ping-Pong? I manage. Really? I beat everyone. He's my bitch. (LAUGHING) The only person I can't beat is Mario. Mario knows how to play. Maybe some let you win? No, I don't think so. Let's see, Pancho. (SNORTS) A snort? No, thanks. Are you sure? Yes. Okay. ANTIN: How's it coming? Will it be ready today? If they bring the parts that I ordered before 3:00 or 4:00, I can get it done last-minute. Don't bullshit. Okay. Listen, I want to tell you something that stays between the two of us. A few days ago, Sosa left with three guys, and I can't find him. Do you know anything? Did you see anything? A car come or go? No, I just check the cars. On Tuesday, two cars left and two came back. But if there is a guy missing or an extra one, I wouldn't know. You don't know shit. Whose car is that? Some guy who came in with Amaya. Amaya. So, what's your specialty? What do you mean? We already know you can fight. What else can you do that could help us? I can manage with anything. That's good, because there is a lot of work here. You can even bring work to Mario, we'll talk about it, evaluate it. Okay. There's a lot of possibility to grow. That's good. What's over there? Nothing. What's up? What do you mean? There is too much going on there for it to be nothing. Since you're asking, that's the door to the old jail. It's our free-trade zone. That's good. Shh. DIOS: What's up? Do you know where your brother is? I need to talk to him. No. If I were you, I wouldn't show myself for a few days. I want to see how we can fix things. Don't worry about it too much. You're not in charge anymore, Morcilla. What do you mean, I'm not in charge anymore? (TUTTING) Who's going to be in charge? You guys are crazy. We're going to try him out. You guys are crazy, you don't even know him. I've been with you for years, you're totally nuts. Don't pay attention to him. Morcilla. Is there anything left in the store? A few beers to celebrate? What a disaster. It looks worse in the daylight. Hmm. What are you reading? A play. For the theater workshop. You like theater? No. I like the teacher. What's up? Is everything okay with us? I don't know. You're moving too quickly. I don't want to be a part of it when they slice you up. Why are you saying this? News travels fast. Is this about Morcilla? I thought you were different. And now you're a traitor. You switched gangs. We were friends. Are you going to charge us for the beers? Look at him. Borges' new pawn. I'm not anyone's pawn. Borges wants to avoid problems because he knows Morcilla acted badly. He put me in his place because he knows we get along. It's a sign of respect. Oh, how nice. You know what? Tell him to suck it. Do you know how many times they shit on us? With everything. With seizures. Drugs. Work. Do what you want. But if I were you, I'd stay awake. I'd take what's left from the robbery and I'd give it back. Then I'd negotiate. (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) Morcilla. Shut your mouth. Morcilla. Shut your mouth. Morcilla's here. Shut your mouth, fucking midget. Morcilla! You're going to end up on fire in your mini circus tent. Get out of here. Morcilla is here. Look. Here's the asshole. INMATE 1: Fatty, come here. INMATE 2: What's up, fag? Come here, piece of shit. MORCILLA: No, get out of here. Door! Door! Door! (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (GROANS) What happened? Did you save your ass? (LINE RINGING) Hello. Amaya, it's me, Antin. Did you lose anything? No, why? Because I'm looking at you sticking your finger up your nose. What the fuck are you doing? I'm sorry. Come to my office. I want to talk to you. I'll see you there, boss. And don't stop anywhere along the way. Come straight here. I'm watching you with the hallway monitors. MARIO: It's too bad he doesn't do social work. Bringing him here is going to cost me a fortune. Is it serious, Doctor? Can we talk outside? MARIO: Yes. You're going to be fine, beauty. Look at how pretty you are, if only I was a few years younger. I'll be back soon, pretty girl. This part of the jail is completely abandoned. You have to enter directly through the Espora entrance. The girl is there. And you have to watch out for the prison guards. Fuck. If they're using a fence in jail, it means that everyone knows. The directors, the guards. I don't know. We have to act fast, because there were strange things happening around the girl this morning. Leave here and call Lunati to give him the information. Hold on. You're moving too quickly. I have to tell you something, too. Your jaw is going to drop. What? Remember you told me that some things didn't make sense with Lunati? Yes. That they kidnapped his daughter. That it's strange. Yes. I figured out what's behind it all. Cash, a lot of cash. They're charging Lunati a ransom for what he stole from Borges. It's more than $3 million. (CHUCKLES) What does that have to do with us? It's obvious. Lunati doesn't think we'll figure it out, and that we'll give him his daughter back for the few pennies we agreed to. (LAUGHING) (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) EL MARGINAL IS A FICTIONAL SHOW.
