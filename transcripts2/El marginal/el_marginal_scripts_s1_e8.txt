 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Help yourself. They took this off Borges in the search. (CHUCKLES) Enjoy. You know, sometimes I think that if I'd dedicated myself to stealing or violence I'd have done very well, because I'm very eager, very attentive, very fussy, I always have an eye for details. And I have a nose for it,

 I can smell... Right away, I can smell when something's going to go bad, and I'm out of there. We had a great partnership. We made good money with Borges and it was going so well. We were having a great time, but suddenly he sold out, he started to plot behind my back, made a deal with the guards and ordered this fuck up of a kidnapping. He brought this girl to the prison, to my prison, and I didn't know. But then you lent him the house to keep the girl. But there I confused myself.

 Because the haul was so big. It was a mountain of cash and I was taken in. You see? My nose failed me. But anyway, we have to keep working and look for another way to achieve a privileged retirement. Besides, for me, our partnership is very beneficial. We're going to get some great returns. So make sure you take into account what I tell you about your friend Borges, so you can learn from his experience. Guard. (DOOR OPENS) GUARD: There's an inmate here for you. No, I'm not expecting anyone today. GUARD: Go in. Oh, yes, sorry, come in. GUARD: Goodbye. Thanks. MAN: How are you? Okay. Lots of work to do. Ah, we all have our cross to bear. You know what? I need to ask you a favor. Who do I have to kill? Various people, but that's not what I'm thinking of. No, listen, does your brother still work in homicide? Yes. Ariel, and a cousin of mine too. You see, didn't I tell you that in my family half are police and the other half, crooks? You can't imagine what holidays are like. (CHUCKLES) I need to find out some information about a child that disappeared. Yeah, sure, I can ask him. It's for the lady who does my housework. It's a relation of hers. The couple that looked after the kid were killed and we don't know what happened to him after that. Look, if it was in the city, my brother would know about it. Yes, it was in the city, but I have to ask for secrecy. No one here can find out, okay? I'm mute. Great. Thank you. No, thank you. I haven't forgotten what you did for me. I wouldn't have been able to say goodbye to my mom if you hadn't gotten them to let me out. Around here you're like a flower among the stones. (LAUGHS) MARIO: God damn it, those motherfuckers. I can't sleep, I need the TV. Son of a bitch. Can't you try counting sheep? What sheep... That jack-off needs a sheep. (LAUGHING) Dirty bastard, what are you doing? (LAUGHING) Tell me, what are you doing? Nothing. He's jacking off about the judge's daughter. MARIO: If you're going to fight, go to the showers and knock each other out there. Okay, bitches. What did you find out? This fag laughs. You never jacked off or what? What did you find out? I'm talking to you, what did you find out? Hmm. The room is on the way to the evangelist wing. This is the room. It's locked, but I got a copy of the key. Mmm-hmm. There's a checkpoint here that's already bought off. Mmm. You're sure we can cut the power without that son of a bitch Antin knowing? Trust me, Marito. Pastor Pena, I'm going to give you a little free sample of your parole. Don't screw it up. "Free" is a manner of speaking, right? Yes. They'll accompany you. They'll stick with you, but don't expect them to help, they'll just make sure you return. Another thing, put your leg here. That's not what we agreed. Put your leg here. Forgive me, but I don't know you well enough. I can't trust you completely. Do you know how this works? I'll clarify. If you stray 300 feet away from them without warning, they're authorized to use your head for target practice. Understood? Okay. And the gun and things I asked for? You'll get them when you arrive. DIOS: Have you got everything, Bigote? Everything's arranged like we agreed. DIOS: Okay, open up. INMATE: (LAUGHS) Great, dude. We're going to screw that son of a bitch. (LAUGHING) DIOS: Let's screw that son of a bitch up good. Bye. (DIOS LAUGHS) Lucrecia. What the fuck happened to the monitors? What? Can't you see they don't work, it's just static, they won't start? Call maintenance. I'm calling. Let's see... Keep going and go around the back. (GIGGLING) What is it? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? You're laughing, that means it's something. I'm talking to my friends. Yes, I guessed, but can't you share it? It's personal. But if you're laughing and you're with me, you can tell me why. LUNA: You made me come here. I'd rather be at home. We agreed that if you didn't go to school, it was so we could spend time together. At least that's what we agreed. Didn't we come here so you could play with your sword? I don't like you talking like that to me. I don't know what you did in that hole without a telephone. LUNA: What, in the prison? Yes, in the prison. I'll be right back. I was talking to my friend James Rodriguez. He was real good company. Now you're fucked. (CLATTERS) (GROANS) No. Don't even think about it. Where is my son? What? The boy who was in my brother's house is my son, where is he? I don't know what you're talking about. My people deal with the details, I have nothing to do with it. Kidnapping a child isn't a detail. Who took him? I'm telling you, I don't know. You killed my brother, and his wife. Once you knew where your daughter was, you didn't need them. I didn't kill anyone, Miguel. Then you tried to kill me in the villa. That was different. You tried to extort money from me. (WHISPERS) Be quiet. Talk. Where's my son? Quickly, or I'll kill you. I don't know, your son is... I don't know, listen. I have a lot of money. Let's make a deal. Piece of shit. Now your ass is on the line you offer me cash but when your daughter was kidnapped you wouldn't offer a dime? It's not like that, you're wrong. You're wrong, I put up the money. I'm asking, please, my daughter is here and I don't know if you understand but I'm all she's got. I'm begging you, please don't kill me, Miguel. I'll do you a favor if I kill you. Talk. I put up the money, Miguel. I gave a million to Borges. I gave him a million. You didn't give Borges anything. You're making it up. I'm not making it up. I gave him a million. Maybe he didn't want to give it to you or share. I left him a million in a car. Listen, the money had a tracker and it went back to the prison. It's there, in San Onofre. If you let me go, I'll get it for you. Let's agree on the figure. Sure we'll agree, but first tell me where my son is. I don't know. Your son was in the house and we left him there. I don't believe you. (MUFFLED GUNSHOT) MAN: I spoke to my brother. And what did he tell you? May I? I asked him by email. There was no news about the kid for several days. They thought he could be dead or something, but then they found this. It's a shot from a security camera. What? Is that him? Yes, that shot was taken two hours after the murders. (EXHALES) Thank you. I really appreciate it. Getting this information means a lot. Well, I hope the kid appreciates it. Yes. Do they know anything else? Who this woman is? Or I don't know... Do they have any other information? No. You know how things work here. I work for Borges and... I understand. Forget it. It's okay, this is a huge help. Seriously. What I can do, if you want, I can give you my brother's details so you can get in contact and speak directly. Okay. Perfect. That would be perfect. Okay, bye. Calambre, don't break anything, okay? No, easy does it. What's happening, dude? Happy, man? We got our shit back. And this guy playing like a fag. Get the fuck outta here. Stop the aggression, you killjoy. We're all happy here. It's not our fault that asshole psychologist ditched you. I don't know why everyone's so happy. If Antin realizes we've got back what he confiscated from us, he'll just confiscate it again. Okay, and we'll get it all back again. If he wants to measure dicks, we'll measure dicks. The never-ending story. I fixed it, I'm a genius. You're a genius, two wires, a genius, a phenomenon. Well, obviously. I'll leave this here for you to sign. Okay. Don't be like that, I can't see you like this. It's not that bad, I've never seen anything amazing on them. It's always the same. Let's see: prisoners working, prisoners eating, prisoners washing, prisoners looking at prisoners. To tell you the truth I prefer Big Brother. Big Brother is scripted, and I prefer to have everything under my strict control. Okay, well, try to calm down, because until they approve everything, who knows when they'll authorize the repair. HOMICIDE JUDGE CAYETANO LUNATI FOUND DEAD And how many ministers it'll have to go through. NEWSCASTER ON TV: He trained every day in a fencing and shooting club in the Nunez district. The murderer, whose identity is still unknown, killed him in cold blood with a shot at point blank range. Son of a bitch, what the fuck? Until now we have no news of the attacker's identity, who managed to escape custody. ARGENTINE REPUBLIC NATIONAL JUDICIARY JUDGE: Cayetano Lunati Hello. Did he do it? Where were you? Police sources say the crime has the markings of the drug trade surely perpetrated by a professional. Look what's happened to my cash. God damn it, motherfucker! And that son of a bitch that killed him? Stop that, stop it. Don't you give a shit? Can't you see what's happening? Oh... What a fuck up. NEWSCASTER ON TV: The judges association... Poor Lunita, what bad luck. ...has lost a true bulwark of justice and democracy. Everyone out of here, jerk-offs. Move your asses, I've got work for you. Let's go, or do you think living here is a joke? Come on, let's go. What the hell do you want, Capece? Shut your mouth, Borges. Let's go. Get to work or I'll put my boot right up your ass. Let's go. No, no. What's this son of a bitch up to? I've already cleared it. Come straight to the visitors' room, with Pena. With Pena, okay? I want to speak to him. What are you looking at? What are you looking at, motherfucker? What are you doing, crazy bastard? I'm going to kill you, asshole. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (MAN WHISTLING) I'm going to kill you. You like that, bitch? I'm sick of you! Holy shit. (LAUGHING) (DOOR OPENS) Are you crazy, Pena? How are you going to get away with killing a judge? The news is out already? The news is out. How could it not be? If I knew I wouldn't have let you go. That's why I didn't tell you, so you're not involved. You realize that justice is slow, but when you mess with it directly, it's fast and efficient. They won't come looking for me. I'm an inmate. I have the perfect alibi. You have the alibi, I don't. I tell you Borges is causing me trouble, and now you are too, or worse. There was no way I could let that guy off. What did that judge do to you? It's personal. What happens if Borges finds out? He won't find out. Who's going to tell him? You could tell someone, and that someone could tell Borges. Careful, because if I get a sniff that you're putting me in the shit, the weakest link gets broken: you. (DOOR CLOSES) Have you seen Pena? Picachu. Get Pastor for me. Ah, no, he's not here. He left really early. Where to? I don't know, no idea. I saw him in the middle of the jail. Listen, have you got a cigarette? No. So, a while ago they came to get him to go talk to the social worker, so I'm sure he's not here either. What does he do when he's here with you? What does he do? Camp with you? No, he ignores me. He stays in the tent, or he babbles away in secret with the guys, you know? I don't know, he's a friend, but recently I don't know what he's up to. The other day I saw him there talking on a cell phone. No idea, pal. If he's your friend, why are you snitching? Because it's you, dude. Because we've known each other so long. I want to help. There's lots of rules here that he doesn't understand, you know? Yes, you have to help. You have to help a lot. Anything strange you see, come and tell me. Sure, you can count on me. DIOS: Where were you? What's up, everything okay? I was with the social worker. Since when? I've been looking for you for a while. What's wrong? I don't know, an hour, whatever. CAPECE: Come on, move your asses and get to work. Let's go, eh? Listen. They killed the judge. Lunati. Really? Yeah. The father of the girl we lost in the villa. Yeah, I know who he is. Well, he's dead. Who was it? You? I don't know who it was. No, it wasn't us. Look, tell me if it was you. I'm telling you the truth, it wasn't us. I wish it had been us, and we'd have got our cash. I don't know who it was. Dude, what a fuck up. It's a fuck up, but it's done now. Listen, what are you doing tonight? I have a surprise for you. What is it? No, it's a surprise. If I tell you it won't be fun. But you put up with me recently when I was a downer. No, forget it. It's fine. Besides, I can't tonight, I'm beat. What do you mean, you can't? What's the matter with you? You left my brother hanging and now you refuse me, you spend all your time with the assholes in Sub-21. You got a problem with the Borges? It's fine, relax. So come then. I can't. Why? Are you going to the cinema? Okay then. What is it? Tell me what it is. A surprise, I told you. Tell me what you want to take and I'll get everything. Coke, weed, whatever you want. Ecstasy. No, just something to drink that's all. Give me a smoke. You're so healthy you make me sick. Always just a cigarette, some water. You know what your problem is? You're like one of those drug addicts who was locked up on a farm, in a field with pigs, cows and everything, eating quince and now you've come out a snob, a hippy, who doesn't want to get high. Something like that. You're right. See, I knew it. Whatever, it's cool. Listen, you'll have a beer, right? Okay. Come on, Pena. You've got your social worker. Again? Let's go. See, the girl can't live without me. I go to sleep, he's watching me. I get up and he's still watching me. On top of that, all day with the San La Muerte stuff, the candles, the flowers. I'm sick of it. I'm free to do what I want. I could say the same about him. I get up, he's watching me. I go to the toilet and he's watching. What are you talking about? Move him to that wing that likes poop pushers. It's not my fault that he likes it in the ass. Okay, enough fighting. Cut it out. You have to get along or one of you leaves the wing. Who wants to go to the courtyard? Yes, send him to the courtyard. You go with those Sub-21 guys, motherfucker. Enough fighting. Cut it out, really. Come in, Pastor. Just a second. You have to learn to be more tolerant, or one of you will go. I get your devotion to San La Muerte, but you have to be more respectful. I don't want you fighting again, okay? Take them away. Enough! Come in, Pastor. Come here. I want to show you something. Is that Lucas? (SOBS) Yes. Any idea who that person with him could be? No. (EXHALES) Did you find anything else? No. No, they just had this shot from Arzabal station. Near your lawyer's house. How did you get this? Through a cop in the homicide division. Do you know his name? No. Why? No, no. The truth is, they're quite confused by all this. They don't have much information, but you have to be calm, we'll get more soon. (BREATHES SHAKILY) Thanks. Really, thanks a lot. What's up? What's all this? This is a part of San Onofre you've never seen. What's up? You'd think you're going into a slaughterhouse. Rati. (SNAPS FINGERS) Come in. Never a button, Nolbelto, eh? A pocket, close it, whatever. Come on, man. Don't be a pussy. This is going to be a great night. We're going to have fun. PASTOR: What is this? What are we doing here? DIOS: Go ahead. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Trust me. I told you we're going to have some fun. We're friends but we never hang out like friends. Just you and me? Alone at last. You and me. To see what happens. (LAUGHS, SLAPS) I can't, dude, you're making me laugh. Look, I've got everything, see? Asshole, you scared me. Just like Willy Wonka. Have a beer, drink. Just help yourself, whatever you want. Have something to eat. I'm in the zero hunger campaign, straight to the dessert. Do you want a line? No, no. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Who's that? Go on, open it. Go on. Hi, baby. DIOS: Welcome, girls. Hi, Pammy. You're looking hot. What's up, sweetie? He's like my brother, so please, treat him with the best possible care. Okay? So you mean, Pastor is your best friend in here? Yeah. (CHUCKLES) Tell me, what do you think? What do I think? You kept it secret. You didn't tell us your friend was so cute. Huh? What do you mean cute? You mean, you want to sleep with him yourself? PAMMY: We could get up on the table. Careful, eh? Careful of what? You're bad girls? You want to fuck him together? Okay, wait. First we have to talk a little, right? Get to know each other. I mean it. Where are you from? From Burzaco, nearby. Where Leoncito's family live, you know it? Burzaco, yeah. It's nice around there. Was it difficult to get in here? No. What's difficult is getting out. (BOTH LAUGHING) Do you want some? Hmm. No, no thanks. What's wrong with your friend? DIOS: He likes to pray, imagine that. PAMMY: Seriously? I pray too. Oh, really? All day. I have a lot of faith, come here. Let's dance a little. Hi, Pastor. (MOANS) (POP MUSIC PLAYING) DIOS: Can I ask you a question? What is it? Why are you so secretive? What the hell's wrong with you? Secretive about what? Nothing's wrong. This morning you disappeared, you told me you were with the social worker, but I don't believe you. Where the fuck were you? I was with the social worker, asshole. Don't lie. What's up? Have you got someone else in here? What do you mean, someone else? Someone else. Another idiot you're the same with. Look, I'm saying I'm getting jealous. What's wrong, are you dizzy? Relax. I put a pill in your bottle. So have a good trip, my friend. (WHISTLING) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) (CHUCKLING) Who are you? Ugly bitch. That's weird. What is it? I'm getting messages from you from the cell phone you gave me to talk to you. Yeah, I changed my cell. I miss you, beautiful. I can't live without your tits. But who the hell is it? I don't understand. Any idea where my confiscated stuff is? (GASPS) Antin, Antin. He had your box of things. I didn't see what was inside. I didn't know the phone was in there. I can't believe it. How dumb can you be? What do you want me to do, my love, what did I know? Don't worry about it, tomorrow I'll get you another number. Really? I'll replace it, yes. Listen, sweetheart. What? Do you mind if I don't eat the fish, I don't feel like it. (CHUCKLING) No, it's okay, it doesn't matter. I want to eat clam today. (LAUGHS) You're filthy! (LUCRE MOANS) What the fuck did you give me, asshole? Why do you ask? You like it? PASTOR: I'm fucked. No, come here, have a line and it'll pass. Come here, asshole, relax. What's up? Come here. Are you getting paranoid now? Come over here. Look around. Pay attention, asshole. Look at the party you've got going here. Tomorrow you're going to be alone, man. The day after, alone, the rest of your time you've got left in jail. And when you get out you'll be alone too. You know you're going to die alone? So I'm telling you... Why not enjoy this paradise? (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GROANING) (SLAPS) How did you manage all this? (CHUCKLES) Everything's possible with cash, baby. Just like anywhere else. Hmm. Always someone who owes you a favor. This idiot was scared we'd have a bad time. Admit it, you were scared. I've never been to a place like this, what did you expect? They pulled an inspection and took everything. The TV, the PlayStation, the games, everything. But fat Gladys rescued it and we got it all back. A genius, that Gladys. You know she's a friend of Gladys'. My sister-in-law, Pastor. Gladys is a genius. And how long have you been in jail? I'm talking to you, Pastor. Years. Poor thing, my little Pastor. You know what? Don't call me Pastor, call me Miguel. I'm finished with the Pastor bullshit. What's wrong, my little Pastorcito? Didn't you hear what I said? I'm Miguel. Okay, okay, Michael. I'm not Pamela, I'm Maxima. I love that name. Every time he gets high this bullshit about being Miguel. (LAUGHS) The other day, too, they shot at him and he was busting their balls that he was Miguel. Pastor, Miguel or whatever the hell you're called come here and shake that thing. (KNOCK ON DOOR) CAPECE: Get up, you pieces of shit. Come on, you sons of bitches. Up. Anyone not out, I'll get you myself and drag you out by the scrotum, let's go. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Did you hear, Pena? I said up, let's fucking go. You didn't hold back last night, eh? Come on, let's go. Great, damn it! You're like a child! Great, look at that! You see, when they want to they can get their act together and ignore the prison bureaucracy. "We can't, we can't", and get things done. Get motivated. Look, if you mean maintenance, we're still waiting. You have Borges to thank. Yes, it was him! He asked them to fix the control panel and they rewired everything. Ah. He's coming to his senses, the piece of shit. Good. Yes, it was a gesture to make peace with you, right? As a gesture of goodwill... Yes? We're going to send him this box we confiscated. Okay. I'm sure he'll love it. Although he bought all new stuff. What do you mean he bought new stuff? Didn't you see? It's all installed. Look. God damn it. I can't believe it. Who the hell authorized it? He's in with the guards then? Set up a staff meeting right away. Okay. Stop. I want to tell you something. Do you know this bastard Borges is fucking a girl here? What? I found it on his cell phone. I've got the messages and photos they sent. They send each other naked pictures, of tits, dick shots. But, who is it? I don't know, they don't share their faces. As far as I know, she's cheating and doesn't want to be seen in the photo. The self-respect that bitch must have to fuck such a hideous guy. What a sleazy bitch. Shall I set up the meeting? Yes! Okay. (LAUGHING) So, what did you say to Brian then? To wait for me to get out. Yeah, but he wants to work now, Mario. I can't just go stealing with any idiot. I warn you, he's hanging out with Torta Rodriguez. With that son of a bitch? No, tell him if he goes it alone, I'll come find him and cut his legs off. I already told him personally. I told him, but you know how he is. He's tough. He won't pay attention to me. He'd better. Bring him next week. I want to talk to him. Okay. Man, poor Diosito. Who'd expect a psychologist to leave you like that? I got him another one. It's not the same, Mario. You don't understand. What do you know whether it's the same or not? Since when have you given therapy? Are you a psychologist now? No, and I wouldn't need therapy either. But he's not like that, you know. Diosito is different, he has a sensitivity. I don't know, he's a saint. I don't understand how you could let this happen. Come on, Gladys. He's a big boy now. Whatever. It's no good. They should take his license, or beat the shit out of him. I don't like it! (SIGHS) Why are you busting my balls, babe? You came to calm me down and you're stressing me out. I won't ask for this place again to be together, stop busting my balls. Baby! Okay, I'm done. You want it on the side? Okay, move your cell phone. Come here, come over here. Come here, Mommy. You like it like this, huh? A little spooning, Daddy. Yes, baby, yes. Throw it properly, man. Come on. Take it, dude. INMATE: Okay, stop. Pastor. What's up, buddy? You're beat. You've got no energy for anything. DIOS: Listen up. Get out of here, we'll finish up. Take off, kid. I didn't even go to the patio last night. How are we doing? Like shit. What the hell did you give me last night? You feel like shit now, but don't tell me it wasn't worth it. INMATE: Man, what are you doing? This is everyone's. Stop it, dude. What's up? Come with me, Pena. Now? Yes, now, let's go, move it. INMATE: Capece, man. What's up, Capece, dude? They give us shit, right. You look terrible. Yeah, I slept badly. Yes, it shows. Because of that, you mean, no, it's not what you think. Whatever, you don't have to explain anything to me. Yeah, no, of course not. Did the homicide cop contact you again? Mmm-hmm. And? You know, you've got me confused, Pastor. Why? Just when I start to understand you, something happens. What is it? They identified the baby's father, and it's not you. You were desperate because your son had disappeared, and today you turn up hungover. No, no. I'm not judging, but I don't understand. It's not what you think. I was dragged into a situation I couldn't get out of. You think this is because I'm one of those guys inside here? You don't have to explain anything. I do have to explain... Yes? Can I talk to you a moment? Yes, of course. Wait here for me a second. How are you. Good. Did you find out anything else? No, tomorrow I have the first ultrasound. I haven't been feeling well, but I suppose that's normal. Yes, I suppose so. And here, do you know any more about here? Oh. I thought you were asking about me. No, yes, as well. I'm asking about everything. Yeah, sure. I'm asking about you too. Of course, but I wanted to know if you noticed any change in Antin, anything strange. If he asked you anything. No. He just wanted to know if we'd spoken. What are you doing tonight? Why? I don't know, I mean, we could see each other. Shall I come by the house? No, honestly, no. Why don't you loosen up a bit? We're going to have a kid together. I'm saying I can stay late, wait for you to fall asleep, stay with you, and leave after. Thanks, Gaston, but no. Go on. Really. I have to go back to work. Okay, go back to work, bye. Bye. I'll send you a message to see if you change your mind. Is that your boyfriend? My boyfriend, what do you mean? I saw how he looked at you, how you looked at him. If he's your boyfriend, it's okay. You're a little confused, right? (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hi, Emma, it's Ariel. How are you? Are you busy? Ah, how are you? I'm working, but tell me, did you find out anything? I just sent you an email with a photo of Miguel Palacios. Just to warn you. Great, I'll check it out now then. Show it to your maid, and if she knows him let me know. She might have information that can help you. Excuse me a second... (THEME SONG PLAYING) EL MARGINAL IS A FICTIONAL SHOW.
